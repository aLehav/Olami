The ﬁ  rst day of Student 
Government elections saw a 
slightly smaller turnout than 
the Spring 2012 semester.
Supervisor of Elections Ste-
phen Davis said 6,274 ballots 
were counted Tuesday.
Last year, 6,517 votes were 
cast on the ﬁ  rst day of Spring elections. Tuesday’s turnout is larger than the ﬁ  rst day of the Fall 2012 election, which 
counted 5,860 votes.
There were no major tech-
nical difﬁ  culties, Davis said.
Mechanical engineer-
ing freshman Jon Pendoley, 
19, said the Google Chrome browser was slow, so he switched to Internet Explorer to cast his vote at the Reitz 
Union.
Students Party spokesman 
Michael Christ said the party 
is thrilled with the support it 
has received.
“We’re excited to meet 
more students tomorrow and 
talk with them about how we can best serve them in Student Government,” he said.Swamp Party spokesman 
Elliot Grasso said his party received support from a wide 
range of students.
“Our volunteers and can-
didates are doing an excellent 
job conveying our positive 
message, informing students 
and voting,” he said.
Voting continues today 
from 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and students can vote at any 
of the 12 locations on campus.
Locations include Room 
C202 in the Springs Resi-
dential Complex; conference 
Room 106 in the  Murphree 
Area Commons; Room 2103B in McCarty B; Broward Hall basement; Jennings’ ﬁ  rst ﬂ  oor library; Bruton-Geer Hall at

Prices at the pump increased 
steadily last week, and Gainesville 
motorists’ wallets are feeling the rise 
in the cost per gallon.
The average price of gas in Florida 
this week is $3.78, which is a 14-cent 
increase from last week, according to 
a Feb. 17 AAA fuel price brief. 
Prices will not noticeably decrease 
until after summer, said Sue Boate of 
AAA at 1201 NW 13th St.
For the ﬁ  rst time this year, the av-
erage gas prices for Florida, Georgia and Tennessee are higher than last year.The spike in prices can be attrib-
uted to many factors, she said. 
The recent snowstorm in the 
Northeast led to a high need for heat-ing oil. 
Along with that, reﬁ  neries are 
switching to the summer blends of fuel, which causes the output to de-crease and fuel to become more cost-ly.
In addition, the wholesale crude 
oil price is steadily increasing, so that price jump is being passed on to mo-torists. 
While prices are expected to in-
crease again this week, it is unlikely Gas prices reach record high 
for February, will increase� IT WILL EMERGE FOR SPECIAL 
EVENTS.

Tacodilla lovers are going loco without 
their Mexican food truck on campus.
The La Lola Loca food truck will no lon-
ger operate daily by the North Lawn. Gator 
Dining announced the change last week on Twitter.
District marketing manager for Gator Din-
ing Services Jill Rodriguez wrote in an email that the food truck will only make appear-ances at special events. She said La Lola Loca participated in a food truck rally in January and will participate again in March as well as 
at the Santa Fe Spring Arts Festival in April.
Updates about the food truck’s appear-
ances will be on Gator Dining’s Facebook 
page and Twitter account, Rodriguez said. 
She said the truck is also available for catered events on and off campus.
The food truck rolled onto campus in Sep-
tember. At the beginning of this semester, La 
Lola Loca changed from a moving truck to a ﬁ  xed location on the North Lawn, extended its hours and expanded its menu.
UF biology sophomore Sophia Neuber, 
19, said she misses the food truck on campus. She said she prefers La Lola Loca to other food venues like Burger King and Chick-ﬁ  l-A.
“I have looked for it a few days now with 
some hunger cravings only to have to satisfy my appetite elsewhere,” Neuber said.

For 26 years, Jan Kasoff was a crucial part 
of “Saturday Night Live.” The former chief 
cameraman followed stars on set, rolled cam-era and filmed famous skits.
On Tuesday night, in a lecture room of 
about 80 UF students, he talked about life behind the camera on one of America’s most popular comedy shows.
“It’s complete chaos,” Kasoff said of the 
90-minute filming period for every Saturday’s show.
UF’s National Broadcasting Society hosted 
the event, which was Kasoff’s second time speaking at UF.
Kasoff talked about censorship for a live 
broadcast.
“When I started out in TV , you could not 
say the word ‘pregnant,’” he said.
Kasoff said “SNL” was about taking risks. 
He said the show pushed the envelope when it came to content. The writers wanted to con-nect with the audience in the most honest way possible, he said. But before times started 
changing, it was hard.
“We were in constant fights with our stan-
dards and practices department,” Kasoff said.
Even with more lenient constraints on the 
show’s material, he said, the writers are still 
butting heads with NBC executives.Kasoff said “SNL” was a milestone in 
entertainment. Videotapes made recording shows prior to airing them a standard practice, so when Lorne Michaels, the show’s producer, came up with the idea of filming a live com-edy show, Kasoff said it was unheard of.
“If we make a mistake, it’s history ,” Kasoff 
said.
Before long, “SNL” was just that — his-
tory.
“Within just a few weeks, ‘Saturday Night 
Live’ skyrocketed,” Kasoff said. “When I left, there was a two-year wait to get tickets to the show.”
Though the show’s comedians inspired 
laughs across the country, Kasoff said the pro-
duction team shared laughs of their own.
He told stories about conflicts and mishaps 
on the set, like the time Sinéad O’Connor, an 
Irish singer, ripped a picture of Pope John Paul II in half on live television.
“I’ll never forget that moment,” he said.Ricki Albritton, a 22-year-old UF telecom-
munication senior, said Kasoff’s presentation was inspirational.
“We want to walk where he’s walked,” Al-
britton said.
Kasoff encouraged students interested in 
being a part of “SNL” and affiliated programs to apply for NBC’s page program.
“It’s difficult,” Kasoff said, “but it’s not im-
possible.”

With its new program, Gator Din-
ing is taking a bite of healthier eating 
choices.
Vegan Days with Chef Johnny Ho,  
which started earlier this month,  is a se-
ries of demonstrations taught by a chef 
who specializes in vegan cooking.  
“It’s great when students can learn a 
new skill, such as cooking, and get excit-ed about nourishing their bodies,” said Janis Mena, a dietician at the Student Health Care Center.
Every Wednesday, Gator Dining cus-
tomers can attend a cooking demonstra-
tion in the residential dining halls. From 
10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., customers can eat vegan food while learning how to make new dishes they can try at home.
The program alternates between 
Gator Corner Dining Center and the Fresh Food Company . 
“It’s important that we provide many choices to satisfy all of our guests includ-ing faculty and staff,” Jill Rodriguez, dis-trict marketing manager for Gator Din-ing Services, wrote in an email.
Leah Chapman, sustainability coor -
dinator for Gator Dining Services, wrote in an email that Gator Dining strives to accommodate a wide range of diets and lifestyles, and they have options avail-able to satisfy vegan dieters.
Some of the dining options include 
portobello mushroom risotto, teriyaki tofu with basmati rice, bean and arugula pasta and Moroccan vegetable stew.
“Learning to cook from a chef’s vege-
tarian dishes is a great thing for students to take advantage of,” Mena said. Chef teaches vegan cooking
� ABOUT 1,600 HUNTERS 
PARTICIPATED.

The Burmese python population in the Ev-
erglades is now a bit smaller — 68 pythons 
smaller, to be exact.
On Monday , The Florida Fish and Wildlife 
Conservation Commission announced the 2013 
Python Challenge results. About 1,600 competi-
tors participated in the hunt for the cold-blood-ed critters, which began Jan. 12, according to an FWC press release.
UF biology staff members, including Joy 
Vinci, an office manager for UF’s Wildlife De-partment Research and Education Center in Ft. Lauderdale, verified, measured and weighed the 68 pythons. They then necropsied and ex-
amined the snakes.
Biologists plan to use the data collected from 
the competition to test tissue samples for heavy 
metals, radioactive isotopes and the python’s diet, Vinci said.
“We’re going to try to do a very quick 
turnaround for publication on this,” she said. 
“We’re hoping sometime in the next couple of 
months.”
The snakes’ population exploded during 
the last couple of years in their predator-free environment. The competition began as a fun 
way to remove the snakes, said FWC spokeswoman Diane Hirth.
“The goal of the python 
challenge was always to raise awareness about these invasive species and their impact on the Everglades,” she said.
The $1,500 grand prize 
for harvesting the most Burmese pythons went to two hunters. A $1,000 prize went to two oth-er hunters for the longest captured snake. Paul 
Shannon won in the general competition cat-
egory with a 14-foot, 3-inch-long python, and Blake Russ won in the python permit category with an 11-foot, 1-inch-long reptile.FWC: 68 pythons captured — and

Janet Blakney, a 59-year-old Regional Transit System bus driver, pays $3.95 a gallon of regular 
unleaded gasoline at the Citgo at the corner of North Main Street and Northeast Eighth Avenue.
Buyers alter spending habits
they will rise another 20 cents, Boate 
said.
According to the Energy Informa-
tion Administration, the national aver -
age is expected to peak at about $3.85, which is not record-breaking, assum-ing catastrophes don’t occur. 
AAA Consumer Pulse surveys re-
flect that consumers begin to alter their spending habits when gas reaches 
$3.75 a gallon. 
This also holds true for Gainesville 
residents as they cut their spending.
Higher gas prices have caused Chris Chambless to go out less in or -
der to save money, the 23-year-old 
Gainesville resident said as he filled up 
his white Jeep Liberty at the Kangaroo 
Express on Southwest 13th Street and West University Avenue Tuesday.
“It’s pretty boring not doing much 
because you know you have to pay so 
much for gas,” he said.
Exotic bird breeder Tom Lucas, a 
44-year-old from Branford, agreed and 
said he too is feeling the consequence 
of high gas prices.
To save money, Lucas said he con-
solidates his trips.
“If I need a luxury item, and it’s a 
far distance, I choose not to go get it,” he said.
To save money on gas, AAA recom-
mends motorists maintain their cars 
through basic procedures such as oil 
and filter changes, which could in-
crease fuel efficiency by 10 percent.GAs , from page 1lifestyle

David Denslow didn’t think 
much about President Barack 
Obama’s State of the Union pro-posal to raise the federal minimum wage to $9.
Denslow, a UF economist, said 
the people who would be most af-fected by this raise are high school dropouts, college students and women with small children.
“The big problem in our society 
is that young men are getting less of an education than our women,” he said. “The displacement of less 
skilled workers by young college 
students and women will have a negative effect.”
The current minimum wage in 
Florida is $7.79 an hour.
The typical person works 2,000 
hours a year, which translates to about 40 hours a week. In Florida, the average person working for 
minimum wage would earn about 
$15,600 a year before taxes.
UF student Conor Munro works 
16 hours a week at Moe’s Southwest Grill on UF’s campus to pay off his student loans.  
“Right now, people working on 
campus work about 20 cents above minimum wage,” the 21-year-old 
history and economics junior said. 
“The real minimum wage accounts for inflation.”  Munro said minimum wage 
wouldn’t affect college students two to three years after graduation.
“Hopefully, we’ll be competing 
for jobs above minimum wage,” he said.
Lawrence Kenny, a UF econom-
ics professor, said federal wages tend to remain constant for a period of time before it increases.
From 2000 to 2006, federal 
minimum wage was $5.15 and in-creased to $5.85 in 2007, according to the 2012 Florida Department of Economic Opportunity wage his-tory report.
“The solution to minimum 
wage is to acquire skills and not be dependent on minimum wage,” 
Kenny said.
Historically, he said, minimum 
wage has had the greatest impact 
on minorities.
Tahiri Jean-Baptiste said raising 
wages would create setbacks for low-income families.
“You can’t raise a family on 
$15,000 a year, but if you raise 
minimum wage, everything will 
go up with it,” the 20-year-old Eng-lish and anthropology junior said.  “If consumers have more spend-ing power, your products will cost more.”
Denslow said the focus should 
be on the salary of the top 1 percent billionaires who are exempt from ordinary income tax rates.
“Instead of paying more for gro-
ceries and hamburgers, I’d rather be taxed for prepaid education, which would help low-income families,” he said.
Munro said students shouldn’t 
take raising minimum wage for granted.
“If you support raising mini-
mum wage, you have to pressure President Obama and make sure he follows through,” he said.

Savannah Mauragis walked out of 
the Lincoln Middle School Auditorium 
into the chilly drizzle Monday night, clutching her third-place science fair ribbon.
The 17-year-old Santa Fe High 
School senior beamed with a smile, not because of the mathematics category award, but because it was her last sci-ence fair.
“I’m free,” she said.Mauragis, who has competed in sci-
ence fair competitions for years, joined about 30 other middle and high school 
students on stage Monday night when 
the Alachua Region Science and Engi-neering Fair winners were announced.
The students presented their proj-
ects Wednesday for judging at Santa Fe College, and they waited almost a week to find out how they did.
The awards were distributed among 
13 project categories, ranging from 
computer science to microbiology to 
botany.
Sara Charbonnet, science fair chair -
woman, said students were notified beforehand that they would receive an award at the ceremony. She said the method is aimed to lessen suspense, stress and disappointment.
“We try to make everyone feel good 
about being here,” she said.
Most students won spots to compete 
in the state science fair next month, and three of them will present their projects in international competition later this year.
Some students, like Molly Ayers, 
were happily overwhelmed when they heard their names called.
Jessica Lee, a 14-year-old Eastside 
ninth-grader, said she was surprised 
when she received first place in the 
senior division of the behavioral and social science category.
She said she didn’t think her project, 
a study on life satisfaction differences between native Chinese children and immigrant Chinese children, would win because it was different from most of the other entries.
“Mine is a pretty simple project, but 
it goes in depth,” she said. “I was not expecting this.”

Ten UF fine arts students will perform 
two shows at the 2013 UF Actor Showcase on 
March 4 in the Laurie Beechman Theatre in New York City.
The showcase features select students who 
will graduate with bachelor’s or master’s de-grees in Fine Arts performing different scenes and songs.
Tim Altmeyer, an assistant professor in 
UF’s School of Theater + Dance, coordinated the trip, which is funded by the college.
He said the showcase started in 2001 and 
is an opportunity for students from the col-lege’s acting and musical theater programs to 
perform in front of agents, managers, casting 
directors and producers in the New York City area.
“We’ve got some recent grads who show-
cased in New York and it launched their ca-reers,” Altmeyer said. 
Lyndon Smith, Alex Hernandez and George 
Salazar are UF graduates who participated in the New York showcase, Altmeyer said. Smith 
is now an actress on the CW’s “90210,” Her -
nandez acts in the Broadway production of 
“Peter and the Starcatcher” and Salazar per -
forms in the off-Broadway musical “F#@king Up Everything.”Marissa Toogood said she hopes she will 
be as successful as her predecessors.
Toogood is a 22-year-old musical theater 
senior, and she is one of ten students who were chosen to travel to New York for this year’s showcase.
“It’s just excited nerves,” she said. “It’s kind 
of like the feeling right before Christmas.”
Anastasia Placido, a 22-year-old acting 
senior, will also perform in the showcase. She said she’s 
looking forward to the trip 
and feels confident in the group.
“We’ve had so much 
time to run these scenes and get them into tip-top shape,” she said.
Placido said she and the 
other nine students were selected based on an 
audition in front of New York casting director 
Alan Silverman. Silverman recommended the ten actors who stood out to him.
In addition to the performance industry 
guests who will attend, the event is open to the public. UF students and alumni in the area are encouraged to RSVP and attend.
This year most of the scenes have comedic 
themes.
“There are moments of contemplation, 
but there are also moments of just ridiculous humor,” Placido said. “So, I would just say if you’re in New York at that time, come see us.”UF actors to perform in New York

Scott Salzman, a UF student, 
was working on a project and 
needed a Web developer. After spending time and money looking outside the UF 
community, Salzman thought 
there could be a better method to match Web development students with community projects.
Salzman, a 20-year-
old finance junior, with a five-member staff from Enactus, a UF entreprenurial 
program, created www.
insourceuniversity.org.
The website is designed to 
fix the problem of outsourcing by marketing the skills of student graphic designers, Web developers and photographers to local businesses.
“When you start to outsource 
outside of the community, you lose that personal element of being able to sit down with your website developer and going step-by-step through the process,” Salzman said.
Insource University artists 
are contacted directly by businesses that view their 
profiles on the site and then 
negotiate their own prices with the businesses.
“It’s not a company — it’s a 
philanthropic project,” Salzman said. “We make no money from the site. It’s strictly to benefit the students with skills that are sellable and the businesses that 
need their services.”The website, which officially 
launched last week, showcases 
a small selection of artists in each category. Every month, a different artist will be featured on the homepage of the site, Salzman said.
“Once the demand rises 
and the community starts to discover the resource that Insource University is, we’re definitely going to take on more artists,” he said. “We’ve had to turn away artists as it is now.”
Andrew Kennedy, 21, a 
UF computer science junior, is Insource University’s first 
featured artist and the Web 
developer for the site.
“I think it’s a resourceful 
thing, and I think it’s a convenient thing,” Kennedy said. “There are a lot of other students who are in my position who would like to do stuff like this, but we have to compete 
with other professionals who 
do it for a living.”
Although the site isn’t 
completely finished, Salzman is hopeful that businesses will embrace this new resource.
“There’s nothing that I’ve 
found that advertises the skills of college students to 
local businesses in an equally 
beneficial situation the way Insource does,” Salzman said. Insource website helps
to give students jobs
� THE ATM WAS AT THE 
STEEPLECHASE PUBLIX.

The Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Office arrested three men Monday 
in connection for stealing credit card information from an ATM outside of a Publix supermarket.
Deputies arrested Ion Nistor, 
25, Soniard Nistor, 33, and Gio-vani Hornea, 21, on resisting ar -
rest, tampering with evidence and multiple fraud charges, according to an ASO arrest report.The report gave the following 
account: At about 6:30 a.m. Mon-day, Ion Nistor walked to an ATM outside Publix, 14130 W. New-berry Road, and placed a credit 
card reader and camera onto the 
machine. He then left. For 
the next three 
hours, the de-vice and camera captured credit card informa-tion. A Publix 
surveillance tape recorded at least 10 transactions during that time.
When Ion Nistor and Hornea returned, they took the devices and left in a Chrysler minivan driven by Soniard Nistor.
When deputies later stopped 
the van at a Waffle House parking lot, the men got out and ran away. Deputies caught all three men. Deputies found a laptop, several cellphones and $2,000 cash in the 
van.
Ion Nistor and Soniard Nis-
tor were booked into the Alachua 
County Jail at about 8:30 p.m. Monday, where they remained Tuesday night with $255,000 bonds.

75 TOTAL VOTESSuperhack Me: 
When social media 
goes all wrong 
Basically , we go on the Internet to be entertained. 
Only every once in a while do we expect to learn 
things.
This week, we were purely amused by the ﬁ  asco that hap-
pened on Burger King’s Twitter page. It was the best and most 
hilarious thing. The hack lasted more than an hour before the account belonging to the burger “restaurant” was suspended, according to a BuzzFeed article.
Burger King released this statement: “It has come to our at-
tention that the Twitter account of the BURGER KING® brand has been hacked. We have worked directly with administrators to suspend the account until we are able to re-establish our legiti-
mate site and authentic postings. We apologize to our fans and 
followers who have been receiving erroneous tweets about other members of our industry and additional inappropriate topics.”
It seems like the hacker group Anonymous was responsible 
for the attack. Giant companies like this shouldn’t have such poor security that they can be hacked so easily and for such a sustained amount of time.
That was Monday. On Tuesday, Jeep’s ofﬁ  cial Twitter ac-
count was hacked by the same group.
“The same people who pulled off a hour-long hijacking of 
Burger King’s account yesterday have struck again, this time tak-ing over Jeep’s ofﬁ  cial Twitter feed,” reported BuzzFeed’s John Herrman, who also covered the Burger King hack. “The posts are similar in nature: shoutouts to the same handful of Twitter users, including @lilinternet and @dfntsc, and there are links to many of the same pictures and videos as yesterday.”
When Burger King’s account was suspended, it gained 
30,000 more followers than it had before the hacking started. So, 
did the hacks just reward fast-food establishments by gaining 
them more Twitter followers? There didn’t appear to be a politi-cal agenda behind the attacks, but maybe it was a commentary on consumerism.
“Earlier today, our ofﬁ  cial BK Twitter Account was compro-
mised by unauthorized users. Upon learning of this incident, our social media teams immediately began working with Twitter se-curity administrators to suspend the compromised account un-til we could re-establish our brand’s ofﬁ  cial Twitter page,” said 
Bryson Thornton, director of global communications at Burger 
King, in a statement to the Associated Press.
Thornton is most likely evaluating how the company’s social 
media accounts are run.  If major corporations can be hacked for funsies relatively easily, then we should all take a look at our multiple accounts’ privacy settings. Your password is probably a lot easier to guess than a humongous company’s password. Anonymous may not have you on its radar, but never piss off an ex or a former best friend or anyone. It’s too easy to ruin some-
one’s reputation online these days. 
McDonald’s tweeted about Burger King’s plight and said, 
“We empathize with our @BurgerKing counterparts. Rest as-
sured, we had nothing to do with the hacking.”
Thank goodness. There are only so many “they DIDN’T have 
it their way” jokes we can make.Obama’s ‘kill-list’ memo is hypocritical 
On March 31, 2008, speaking to supporters at a cam-
paign stop, then-presidential candidate Barack 
Obama argued, “The biggest problems that we’re 
facing right now have to do with George Bush trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch 
and not go through Congress at all … and that’s what I 
intend to reverse when I’m president of the United State of America.” 
Obama, like other liberal Democrats, was a vocal and 
outspoken critic of President Bush’s counterterrorism pol-icies. From the detention of suspected terrorists at Guan-
tanamo Bay to the “enhanced interrogation techniques” 
used on detainees to extract intelligence, Obama argued 
that these policies represented an executive power-grab 
by the Bush administration.
A Justice Department memo that NBC recently ob-
tained and released indicates that President Obama does not live in the same hemisphere as Candidate Obama. 
The memo, also known as “the white paper,” lays out the 
Obama administration’s argument for its drone program 
— speciﬁ  cally, how the president decides when it has the 
ability to kill U.S. citizens. 
A lethal drone strike against a U.S. citizen, the Justice 
Department argues, is legitimate and constitutional if an individual “poses an imminent threat of violent attack 
against the U.S.” The imminence of such an attack is de-
termined by “an informed, high-level ofﬁ  cial of the U.S.” 
without any review from the legislative or judicial branch 
of government.   
And what evidence is needed to show that an “immi-
nent threat” exists? The paper states that to prove a threat, 
the government does not need “to have clear evidence that 
a speciﬁ  c attack on U.S. persons and interests will take 
place in the immediate future.”
These drone strikes are not unconstitutional and award 
the target due process, according to the paper, because the U.S. government “may act in national self-defense to 
protect U.S. persons and interest who are under continual 
threat of violent attack by certain al-Qaida operative plan-ning operations against them.” In other words, these targeted drone 
strikes of U.S. citizens are ﬁ  ne be-
cause they are acts of war.
The arguments outlined in this 
Justice Department memo should 
give every American pause — especially those who value civil 
liberties and due process of law. Furthermore, liberals who rightly 
decried Bush’s counterterrorism policies should be equal-ly critical of this president.
A common counterargument made by conservatives 
when liberals criticized Bush was that we did not have 
all the information given to the president when he made 
those decisions. In response to criticism on Twitter, liberal commentator and MSNBC host Touré responded, “He’s 
the Commander in Chief.”
Well, that settles it.Conservatives have pointed out the hypocrisy of lib-
erals who now defend the seemingly endless unilateral authority of the president to kill U.S. citizens abroad. But 
that’s where their argument stops.
Some conservatives are actually quite pleased with the 
president’s policy of killing suspected terrorists in places like Pakistan and Yemen — countries on which we have 
not declared war. So, what if we kill U.S. citizens who 
might be aiding and abetting terrorists in the process?
It doesn’t matter if the targets of drone strikes are 
American citizens or not. If humans have natural rights, 
independent of nationality, religion, creed or citizenship, 
then everyone has a natural right to be given due process.
To put our faith in one man or one branch of govern-
ment to unilaterally determine whether a person’s life 
should end simply because an informed, high-level ofﬁ  -
cial has reason to believe that this person might pose an imminent threat is not good enough.

opinions@alligator.org WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 2013 § ALLIGATOR, 7
While researching for her biography 
“All In: The Education of General David Petraeus,” Paula Broadwell 
spent months in Afghanistan with General Petraeus, then-commander of the Interna-
tional Security Assistance Force, to fully un-
derstand America’s most prominent general of the last decade. The now-infamous affair that ensued between Broadwell and her sub-ject during that time shed new light on the complicated relationship between the media and the military. The scandal demonstrated how contemporary media coverage of the military may lead to the disclosure of sensi-tive material and also how it causes report-ing bias. As the nation winds down over a decade of war, it is time to analyze the com-plex relationship between journalists and soldiers.
The relationship between the press and 
the armed forces has not always been as close as today’s. After journalists relayed overtly negative stories to the American public during the Vietnam War, the military increasingly distanced itself from the media. Even as late as the Persian Gulf War, jour -
nalists were strictly managed and generally kept separate from American servicemen and women. This policy changed during Operation Iraqi Freedom, when the U.S. De-partment of Defense allowed 600 journalists to embed with the troops.
The intimacy provided certain advantag-
es. On the one hand, the military was reported in a more favorable light, because journalists wrote about men and women they knew and interacted with on a daily basis. On the other hand, reporters received detailed knowledge and information about their subjects, and the public became better informed. Embedded journalists received an added benefit: protec-tion. Of the 150 media workers killed on the job in Iraq from 2003 to 2011, only 26 were not Iraqis. Essentially all foreign journalists employ security — for those embedded, this safety is free and guaranteed.
The close relationship, however, has sev-
eral disadvantages. First, the media may be granted too much access to the military, de-pending on your views regarding freedom of information. Nonetheless, it is true, despite our opinion on the legitimacy of this free-dom and whether it pertains to all state in-formation (as Julian Assange and his follow-ers would believe), the media may reveal information that is clearly not in the interest of the military.  The 2010 Rolling Stone inter -
view with General Stanley McChrystal, for instance, revealed serious personal divides 
within the defense organization. As a result 
of his public comments, General McChrystal was relieved of his command, and soon after the incident then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates issued a memo to officials urging cau-tion in interactions with the media.
Second, when journalists act closely with 
troops, they tend to exhibit bias in favor of the military. (A notable counterexample to this trend is the behavior of the media dur -
ing the Vietnam War, when journalists were biased against the American military.) From the two World Wars to Iraq, the closer re-porters are to soldiers, the more agreeable the relationship. While the journalist-soldier 
embrace may be beneficial to the armed forc-
es, it deprives the public of a truly accurate picture of the situation on the ground.
It is dubious to assert any piece written 
in a war zone, however, would be impartial, yet the information embedded journalists glean is unsurpassed. Biased reporting is not necessarily an evil. Neutrality is certainly valuable, but writers and reporters should also be able to convey 
their perspectives. 
Doing so provides a more accurate picture of 
their experiences. If we accept the premise of biased reporting, though, it is important we recognize it when we read it — something the public may not do. The problem is bias is often reported and interpreted as fact, so we believe we gain a neutral standpoint on a topic when the opposite is true.
Attempting to destroy media bias is nei-
ther realistic nor appropriate. We should recognize that although there are certainly many pieces with a pro-military bent, there are also reports with opposing viewpoints. We should train ourselves to more accu-
rately identify this partiality, and in doing so 
pro-military media bias would become sim-ply another perspective from which we read the news.

The relationship between the press and the armed forcesColumn
Hi, my name is Luke Killam, and I’m running to 
represent the UF College of Engineering in the Student Government Senate.  
I am a transfer student from the University of West 
Florida, where I was in the honors program and gradu-
ated with an Associate of Arts degree. Aside from my in-
volvement in the honors program, I also held leadership positions in the Baptist Collegiate Ministry and student government.     
During my time at UWF, the student government bal-
anced the budget so that a surplus of money was redis-tributed to give students free printing credits to their cam-pus accounts. This was something that we, as members of Student Government, took great pride in because it was 
the first time free printing had ever been applied in this 
manner.
As a senator for UF’s College 
of Engineering, I would have no agenda — except for one driven by the wants and ideas of engi-neering students. That being said, 
these are some of the initiatives that have been brought to my attention thus far:
1. Push for a digital textbook platform2. Add cloud storage space to Gatorlink accounts3. Increase hours of operation at Marston Science Li-
brary
4. More discussion time in classes5. Add more power outlets to Marston6. Renovate furniture and increase whiteboards at 
Marston
This summer, I had the opportunity to work for Con-
gressman Jeff Miller and Senator Marco Rubio in Wash-ington, D.C. My time with them made me realize how in-fluential The Gator Nation truly is, because they are both UF alumni.  
Our college produces leaders. Right now, more than 
367,000 alumni represent UF worldwide. I would be hon-ored to serve within a student government that will work to ensure UF continues to be a place where all alumni can return and be proud of their foundation in The Gator Na-
tion.

Speaking OutOn Wednesday, columnist Erik Skipper ended his 
asinine ramblings about rap music with a ques-tion: “Does that make me out of touch?” This 
was in reference to his not seeing rap as an art form wor -
thy of respect and denouncing it as one of the great evils 
of American society (“OMG, the black rapper thugs are 
poisoning our youth”).
Well, I’m not sure if those beliefs make you out of 
touch, but they certainly bring into question your ideas 
concerning race, gender equality and artistic expression 
that challenge the status quo.
Apparently the source of male patriarchy and misog-
yny originate with hip-hop, and those thugs are the ones 
who oppress women and prevent them from achieving true equality.
It’s not at all an American society that has long de-
valued women as second-class citizens who are worthy 
only through the constructs of motherhood and sexual-
ity.
Also, promiscuity of the youth should be blamed on 
rap music, and if this wretched art form would disap-pear — and I guess the race the music originated from 
— America could be a great, moral nation again without 
all this debauchery.I guess the conservative love 
of the First Amendment only ex-
tends to a certain demographic of people in this nation, and Skipper 
seems very willing to ignore the precious Constitution 
to deprive these “pigs” of their speech.
This makes sense, because these rappers hold so much 
power in society, and the largely white record executives don’t have a role in promoting the messages in music.
Skipper reminds me of the early critics of jazz and 
rock ’n’ roll who thought this music, which also largely 
originated from black people, would corrupt the youth 
with its messages of drugs and sexuality. Jazz and rock 
were seen as too sensual and youth who listened to it would become sex-crazed and drug-addicted.
Well — as you can see from your apparent worshiping 
of those like Bob Dylan and Jimmy Page — that opinion 
didn’t hold up.
I guess, like those in the past, your opinion will just 
be left in the dustpan of history.
PS: Listen to rap that’s not Top 40 before you take the 
time to libel a whole genre of music.

The last of its kind
A life of music, travel and dog shows brought Russell Milner, now 93, to Gainesville in 1987, when he and his wife, Louise, took over the Calusa Animal Inn, a board-
ing kennel. Milner’s wife passed away in 2001, and in 2007 he sold the kennel, only to take it up again in 2010. The kennel is set to be closed down in 2014 due to zoning 
restrictions and noise complaints. Milner worries about his clientele, as his kennel is the only one in the area.
 
Milner has enjoyed owning and operating the 35-year-old kennel, but it’s not what it used to be. He has been fighting to keep it open and is tired of the conflict and 
frustration. But for now, he’s looking on the bright side and continues to accept animals of all shapes, sounds and sizes and tries to not worry about the future.

Baseball America named former UF catcher Mike Zunino 
the No. 17 prospect in baseball on Tuesday. The Seattle Mariners selected him third overall in the 2012 MLB Draft.SEC honors Powers’ power

JOSH JURNOVOY
Alligator Staff Writer
ORLANDO — Florida’s lineup 
was supposed to experience a power 
outage this season. Home runs would be at a premium, and UF was going to rely heavily on manufacturing runs.
On Tuesday night, the Gators 
continued to show they aren’t one-
dimensional offensively.
No. 17 Florida (3-1) used four in-
field hits and two homers to defeat UCF (2-2) 5-3 in Orlando in front of a record crowd of 3,678 at Jay Berg-man Field. 
“I don’t think we should label ourselves as a speed team or a power team,” freshman shortstop Richie Martin said. “We just do anything we 
can to win.”
Sophomore Zack Powers, who hit 
two grand slams and drove in nine 
runs in UF’s 16-5 win against Duke on Sunday, continued his torrid pace.

ORLANDO— Richie Martin doesn’t hit the home runs 
like his teammates. He doesn’t get sacrifice flies. He didn’t 
even reach the outfield in half of his at-bats on Tuesday.
Instead, the freshman shortstop put his speed on display 
in Florida’s 5-3 win against UCF at Jay Bergman Field.
Martin had a career-high three base knocks.
His first two singles were infield hits between third and 
short.
His legs did the rest.
After a one-out infield single in the top of the first, Mar -
tin advanced to third base on a bouncing ground ball into left field off the bat of Casey Turgeon.
“I’ve said it before: He’s disrup-
tive,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said of Martin. “He’s instinctual on the base 
paths. He’s aggressive. He’s off to a 
good start.”
Martin joins leadoff man Harrison Bader in a speedy 
duo at the top of Florida’s lineup. 
The two freshmen give the Gators options at the top of 
the order.
The duo went 5 for 10 at the plate against the Knights.
“They are both really good freshmen,” Zack Powers 
said. “Getting on base is their job as the one and two hole, 
so they are doing a good job of that so far.”
Martin and Powers are tied with a team-leading six 
hits.
The Seattle Mariners selected Martin this past summer 
in the 38th round of the MLB Draft.
He scored 25 runs and stole 21 bases during his senior 
year at Brandon Bloomingdale High. 
Through four games, he leads the Gators with two sto-
len bases.
He stood out in offseason scrimmages by routinely turn-
ing singles into extra-base hits.
Martin follows a tradition of talented Florida shortstops. 
From David Eckstein to Nolan Fontana, the names are hard to miss.Freshman active on

Down by three with 3.1 seconds left, Flor -
ida had an opportunity to tie Missouri and 
send the game into overtime. But guard Mike 
Rosario’s desperation heave from the left cor -
ner couldn’t find the net. 
Missouri (19-7, 8-5 Southeastern Confer -
ence) clawed back from a 13-point deficit to upset No. 5 Florida (21-4, 11-2 SEC) 63-60 at 
Mizzou Arena in Columbia, Mo. “When the game was on the line, I thought 
we made some big plays defensively,” Mis-souri coach Frank Haith said.
The Gators defeated the Tigers in an 83-52 
blowout on Jan. 19 in the O’Connell Center, but Tuesday was a different story . 
Florida held a 49-36 lead with 10:51 re-
maining, but Missouri responded with a 17-5 run to cut UF’s lead to one point with 4 min-
utes left in the contest. 
Guard Kenny Boynton was fouled by Miz-
zou guard Phil Pressey on a runner at the 3:44 mark and made his free 
throw to put UF up 57-53. But Tigers guard Jabari Brown responded with 
a three-pointer to cut the 
Gators’ lead to one. On the 
next play, Pressey drove down the left lane, made a layup and drew a foul to 
help Missouri take its first lead of the night with 2:47 remaining. He drilled his free throw to put the Tigers up 59-57. With 1:39 left, guard Scottie Wilbekin used 
a pick from forward Erik Murphy to bury a three-pointer, helping Florida retake a one-point lead.
Missouri forward Laurence Bowers then 
drained a jumper from the elbow to put the Tigers ahead. On the next two plays, Boynton and Pressey traded missed threes.
With 19.1 seconds left, the Gators had the 
chance to take a lead, but Boynton missed a Florida surrenders double-digit lead in road loss to MissouriFlorida holds off UCF rally in road win

Martin met Fontana on his 
recruiting visit last year. They 
have different styles at the plate, 
but the two have slick gloves at 
short.
Martin has recovered since committing an error on the sec-ond fielding chance of his col-lege career in Friday’s 4-3 loss to Duke. He has made plays remi-niscent of Fontana in the hole to 
his left and his right.
After Fontana helped Turgeon 
develop during his first season, the second baseman has done 
the same for Martin. 
Fontana left to pursue a career 
with the Houston Astros. Florida didn’t have another shortstop in 
its 2012 recruiting class. Senior 
Cody Dent was the only remain-ing player on the roster with any college experience at shortstop. 
Dent now starts in center field.
The starting job at shortstop 
seemed like Martin’s to lose.
“I didn’t know when I first 
came on campus,” Martin said. 
“I obviously had to earn it. 
Yeah, it was a little pressure. I 
was kind of nervous. I try to not put extra pressure on myself. I just try to go out and have fun 
and do what I can for the team.”
Martin’s coaches told him that 
with his speed, hitting the ball in 
the air is useless. He has just one 
fly out this season. 
He used the advice and his 
speed again on Tuesday night. 
 “That’s what got me here,” 
Martin said. “It’s pretty impor -
tant. That’s what I try to utilize 
and take advantage of.”
Contact Adam Pincus at apin-
cus@alligator.org.Powers led off the fourth inning by taking an 0-1 pitch from Knights 
starter Brian Adkins deep to right field to put the Gators up 3-0.
Moments earlier, the teams’ benches exchanged heated words fol-
lowing UCF catcher Ryan Breen’s hard slide into second baseman 
Casey Turgeon on an inning-ending double play.
Returning Florida players accounted for only 14 of its 75 home 
runs last season. In 2013, the Gators have hit five home runs — only one fewer than last year’s squad had through four games.
“We’re not going to hit 75 like we did last year,” coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan said. “But we’re going to hit a fair share.”
First baseman Vickash Ramjit, who gave the Gators a 2-0 lead with 
a leadoff home run in the second inning, helped add some insurance to Florida’s lead in the top of the sixth. Ramjit advanced from first to third on Powers’ bloop single to left field.
“As soon as I saw it up, I knew the left fielder was really far back 
and it had a chance to fall,” said Powers, who finished 3 for 4 with a walk. “I was just hoping it would.”
Three batters later, both Powers and Ramjit scored to put the Gators 
ahead 5-0. Knights shortstop Tommy Williams’ throw off a Harrison Bader ground ball bounced past first baseman James Vasquez and into right field.
Florida also showed its ability to play small ball.Martin reached on an infield single on the second at-bat of the 
game. He broke for second on a steal attempt and advanced to third on a bouncing a single off Turgeon’s bat that found a hole between the third baseman and shortstop.  Justin Shafer then drove Martin in with a sacrifice fly to right to give UF a lead that it would not relinquish. 
Martin and freshman left fielder Harrison Bader combined to go 5 
for 10 with five singles.
“Zack and Vick are more our defined hitters,” Martin said. “We 
just try and get on base in front of them so they can get some RBIs and we can cause some havoc on the bases.”
UF plays its fifth game in six days tomorrow night against Geor -
gia Southern at 7 p.m. at McKethan Stadium. Shafer will start on the 
mound against the Eagles.
“It’s awfully early, and we still have a lot of stuff to work on,” 
O’Sullivan said. “But I was awfully proud of the way they played to-
night.”

MARTIN , from page 13Gators finished 10 of 33 from three-point range in defeat
three from the top of the key with 
7 seconds remaining. The Tigers’ Keion Bell pulled down the re-
bound, drew a foul and then hit two 
free throws to put Missouri up by three. 
Florida had no timeouts remain-
ing, so Boynton was forced to rush down the court and find Rosario in the corner. But the guard could not convert at the buzzer. 
Bowers, who missed the Jan. 19 
meeting with a sprained MCL, re-corded 17 points on 8-of-17 shoot-ing and 10 rebounds. 
“He’s an efficient player,” coach 
Billy Donovan said. “He can do it on the offensive glass. ... He can shoot it great. I think it was a matter of time before he started to get into a groove being out with an injury.”
Missouri outrebounded UF 40-
28. The Tigers outscored the Gators 24-16 in the paint.
“We did a great job of sweeping 
the gaps and keeping them out the middle of the paint,” Haith said.
Rosario led UF with 14 points on 
5-of-12 shooting. Boynton added 11 on a 4-of-13 clip. 
Murphy went scoreless in the first half, missing all six of his at-tempts. He finished the contest with eight points on 3-of-11 shooting. 
Florida shot 40.7 percent from 
the field and took 33 of its 54 shots from behind the arc, making only 10. 
Missouri committed 19 turnovers 
as both teams combined for 33. 
The Gators went 6 of 12 from the 
charity stripe, helping the Tigers claw back.
UF missed the front end on all 
three one-and-one attempts in the second half. 
Pressey scored 7 points. The Ti-
gers guard went scoreless in the first 
half. 
UF began the contest shooting 3 
of 5 from behind the arc and owned 
a 29-18 lead against Missouri with 4:37 left in the first half. But the Ti-
gers cut the Gators’ lead to three at 
halftime after making an 8-0 run. Florida shot 0 of 8 shooting in the half’s final 4 minutes.
The Tigers are now 15-0 at home 
this season. The Gators leave Co-lumbia, Mo., with a 7-4 road record and a 1.5-game lead in the SEC standings.

The Gators begin a busy stretch with to-
night’s home opener.
On Wednesday, No. 3 Florida (3-0) will 
host the first of three games in five days, 
starting with No. 19 Stony Brook (1-0) at 3:30 p.m.
The upcoming stretch marks the first 
time in program history that the Gators 
will play three games in such a short span during the regular season.
Coach Amanda O’Leary said the stretch 
is stressful for the coaches because there is less time to draw up individual game plans for each opponent.
“Our coaches are going to give us great 
game plans for each game,” sophomore midfielder Nicole Graziano said. “So, if we follow those, then I think we will be good.”
Dating back to Florida’s 15-4 win 
against Jacksonville on Feb. 13, the Gators will  play five games in 11 days.
O’Leary said she is not the only one 
dealing with pressure during a long stretch.
Busy stretches take a mental and physi-
cal toll on Florida’s players.
“It’s our student athletes that are deal-
ing with the academics, dealing with the practice schedule, so I have to credit them,” O’Leary said.
“If we can come out of this stretch with 
a couple more wins, then it will be kudos to them.”
The players’ perspective is slightly dif-
ferent than that of their coaches.
“I’m not worried at all,” senior attacker Ashley Bruns said. “I come out to compete. 
I love games.”
The Gators are tired of facing each other 
in practice.
“I’m really excited because playing 
against each other in practice every day 
just kind of gets boring,” Graziano said. “To see new faces and playing them is just really exciting. It really can’t make us worse. It can only make us better.”
Florida will take on Stony Brook, UC 
Davis and UAlbany in the next five days. 
Fortunately for the Gators, all three 
contests are at Dizney Stadium.
“We are so excited about it,” Bruns 
said.
“Three home games straight, and we 
have been traveling on the road for the last week and a half.”
Despite the strain of heavy competition 
in a short stretch, Bruns and UF are not worried.
“I’d rather have a game than a prac-
tice,” Bruns said.
“I’m so excited to have all these games 
in a row, that’s what we live for, that’s why we are here.”WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Jaterra Bonds was known for 
her erratic on-court behavior for 
the Gators last season.
Then a sophomore, Bonds was 
clearly talented. She was the only 
player to start each of Florida’s 33 
games, but her demeanor on the floor often rubbed teammates the wrong way.
When the Gators struggled 
during Southeastern Conference play, Bonds was prone to out-bursts following missed defen-sive assignments or botched of-
fensive sets.
A year later, the Gainesville 
native has reined in her emotions 
while still serving as UF’s vocal leader. A torn ACL sidelined Car -
lie Needles last season, but the redshirt freshman has observed the progression of Bonds’ attitude on the court.
“She’s really learning how to 
be more of a leader and be patient with us,” Needles said of Bonds. “You just can’t take anything she says personal. It’s just part of the game. I get mad, coach Butler gets mad, even Jennifer (George) gets mad, believe it or not. When you see that, you know it’s coming, 
because Jaterra wants more out 
of you.”
Now a junior, Bonds has bet-
ter maintained her composure rather than playing recklessly during disappointing stretches.  As a result, she has increased her production and become more consistent.
She leads the Gators in scor -
ing at 12.3 points per game and is 
tied with freshman guard Sydney 
Moss for the team lead in assists, averaging 3.4 per game. 
Bonds averaged 8.1 points and 
2.6 assists per contest last season.
“If she played this way last 
year, we would have won at least four or five more games,” said Jordan Jones, a member of last 
season’s team. “Not that in any 
way she cost us games, but she’s one of the best guards in the SEC right now — she could be a differ -
ence-maker on any team with the way she is playing.” 
The improvement from Bonds 
was necessary, as Florida lost nearly its entire backcourt from 
a season ago. Seniors Lanita Bar -
tley, Deana Allen and Jones each 
averaged more than 19 minutes per game.
In their absence, Bonds and 
Needles have become the Gators’ two primary guards. 
Through 12 conference games, 
Bonds is tied for third in the SEC in 
minutes played at 36.3 per game. 
Needles ranks third for Florida at 26.2 minutes per contest. 
Despite shouldering much of 
the load, Bonds has not shown  fatigue down the stretch. She has scored in double-figures in each of UF’s past four games and has failed to put up at least 11 points in an SEC game just twice — in losses to Georgia on Jan. 27 and Missouri on Jan. 31. 
“I just have to trust what I did 
in the summer and what I have accomplished and let it carry over into the game,” Bonds said. “In crunch time, you can’t be think-ing about how tired you are. You have to be thinking about win-ning the game.”
Recruit earns another honor:  
Class of 2013 prospect Ronni Wil-
liams was selected on Feb. 14 to participate in the 2013 McDon-ald’s All-American High School Game.
Williams, a 6-foot-2 forward 
from Daytona Beach, is the first-ever Gators signee to be selected 
to the game. 
“[I am] really proud of Ronni 
and the year that she has had lead-
ing her team now into the state tournament in Lakeland, which is fantastic,” Butler said. “It’s just a great indication of how hard our staff has worked and our teams have battled to establish us as a 
program where Ronni Williams 
wants to be a part of what we’re doing moving forward.”

Gymnast Bridgette Caquatto endured 
several setbacks even before arriving at 
Florida. 
Two days before the 2011 Pan American 
Games, Caquatto injured her knee. Surgery revealed that she had chipped her kneecap and suffered muscle tears.
Caquatto then suffered a partial tear in 
her rotator cuff during the 2012 U.S. Olym-pic Trials. She underwent shoulder surgery on May 31, and has spent the fall semester rehabilitating.
Until late November, she was held ex-
clusively to rehab and physical condition-ing.
“I would say she was held together by 
some tape all summer long,” coach Rhon-da Faehn said. 
Despite regaining strength in her shoul-
der and knee, Caquatto’s freshman season may be in jeopardy. 
Faehn held an individual meeting with 
Caquatto on Monday to discuss potential eligibility concerns if the freshman contin-ues to participate in exhibitions this sea-son. 
According to NCAA rules, a gymnast 
cannot appear in more than 30 percent of a team’s events. 
Although Caquatto has only competed 
in exhibition routines, those count as an appearance. 
Faehn initially wanted Caquatto to per -
form exhibition on bars and floor during Florida’s 197.3-196.175 win against Geor -
gia on Saturday but ultimately scrapped the plan.
“We chose not to because we’re not re-ally sure just yet,” Faehn said.
“Now that it is in the later part of the 
season, if she’s to go out and (competes in) exhibition ... she’ll lose a full year of eli-gibility because of competing in the latter half of the season.” 
Junior Mackenzie Caquatto, Bridgette’s 
sister, joined her sibling in rehab exercises for support. A typical day of rehab in-volves the sisters taking an 8-mile bike ride and strengthening Bridgette’s fast twitch muscle fibers.
“I can’t believe 
[Bridgette has] already come as far as she has after her shoulder sur -
gery,” Mackenzie said. 
“Usually, after sur -
gery, it takes gymnasts close to nine months to a year to recover, and not even at six months she 
was starting to do things.”
Bridgette was sidelined from Jan. 4 un-
til Jan. 18 but participated in exhibition against Auburn on Jan. 25 and Arkansas on Feb. 1.
She competed only on bars during Flor -
ida’s 197.65-196.025 win against Auburn, scoring a 9.8. In Florida’s 197.575-196.175 win against Arkansas, she scored a 9.85 on bars and a 9.65 on floor.
Though Bridgette could add depth to 
the Gators’ lineup, Faehn wants to be sure 
she can make the most of the freshman’s 
time at Florida.
“I don’t want to risk her losing a whole 
year, because she is that talented,” Faehn 
said.
“But at the same time, I want her in 
there.”Freshman’s season in jeopardy
◗ FLORIDA WON 800-METER FREE 
RELAY WITH SEASON-BEST TIME.
CHUCK KINGSBURY
Alligator Writer
Pawel Werner, Sebastien Rousseau, 
Eduardo Solaeche-Gomez and Marcin 
Cieslak put Florida within range of the 
Southeastern Conference championship 
on Tuesday in College Station, Texas. 
The group registered a 6:14.76 in the 
800-meter free relay and finished 6 sec-
onds ahead of second-place Tennessee 
for Florida’s first outright win of the tournament.
The Gators’ time tops their previous 
season-high mark of 6:21.84 set during 
the Ohio State Buckeye Invitational in 
Columbus, Ohio, on Dec. 1. 
The time is the third-best in school 
history. 
At the close of the first day of compe-
tition, the fourth-ranked Florida men’s team sits in third place with 149 points. The fifth-ranked women’s team ranks seventh with 126 points after the first 
day of competition.
Florida placed in the top three of all 
four team relay events. 
The team of Christian Homer, Matt 
Elliot, Cieslak and Brad deBorde placed 
third in the 200 medley relay.
The combination earned Florida’s second overall NCAA “A” time, finish-
ing in 1:25.64.  
In the other pool, the Gators wom-
en’s team placed second in both the 200 
medley and 800 freestyle relays.
Sinead Russell, Hilda Luthersdot-
tir, Ellese Zalewski and Natalie Hinds matched Florida’s season-best in the 200 medley with a time of 1:35:96.
The Gators closed the evening with a 
season-best 6:56.63 on the 800 freestyle relay. Zalewski, Russell, Beisel and Bo-hunicky topped UF’s season-best mark of 7:04.58. 
Despite the early success, Florida 
faces an uphill climb with SEC rival Au-burn ahead in the standings. 
The Auburn men’s team holds a 
40-point lead against second-place LSU. 
Florida ranks third, trailing by a total of 
47 points.
On the women’s side, UF trails first-
place Tennessee by 59 points heading 
into the second day of competition. 
The Tigers have edged the Gators in 
the last three seasons on the men’s side 
at the SEC Championships by narrow margins.
In 2012, Auburn topped Florida by 
30.5 points.
UF will participate in preliminar -
ies for the 500 freestyle, 200 individual
