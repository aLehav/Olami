Students from the Swamp Party react to election results early Thursday morning on the Reitz Union Colon-

Students packed the Reitz 
Union Colonnade late Wednes-
day night to hear the results of 
the UF Student Government’s Fall 
2012 Student Senate elections. 
Supervisor of Elections Ste-
phen Davis read them shortly af-
ter midnight.
The Swamp Party cheered and 
chanted after claiming 35 seats — 
the majority. The Students Party claimed 14.
“I think that we won a major-
ity of the seats, and that’s fantas-tic,” said Swamp Party spokes-man Daniel Landesberg.
One District D seat was split, 
as both Micaela Montero Dokser and Amit Gangrade received 413 votes. 
The Senate will decide who 
wins that seat, said UF Supreme Court Justice Matt Michel.
“[This] is a remarkable achieve-
ment,” Students Party campaign manager Dave Bradshaw said.
This year, 9,197 students cast 
ballots, which is an increase from the 8,271 ballots cast last Fall. Spring 2012 elections had one of 
the highest voter turnouts ever, 
with 10,644 voters.
“I think elections went very 
well,” Davis said. “I couldn’t be happier about the turnout.”
The ballot also included two 
referendums, both of which vot-ers opposed. 
Referendum questions are 
nonbinding and are used to gauge student opinion.
About 76 percent of the 7,233 
students who voted on the refer-endum clicked “no” when asked about renaming the Reitz Union after Virgil Hawkins.
“It’s always hard to change 
something that’s ingrained in our tradition,” said Ford Dwyer, Stu-dents Party president and author of the referendum. “Even if the 
tradition isn’t what the univer-Swamp Party wins majority of Student Senate seats

� TODAY IS WILL CLAYE DAY.

Before Will Claye ran like his brother, he 
walked like him.
“I always wanted to be just like him,” the 
21-year-old Gator and two-time Olympic med-
alist said. “He would go to [track] practice, and I would come with him and just watch him.”
Since then, Claye’s feet have brought him 
a long way . 
Today is Will Claye Day in Gainesville.After winning a national title in triple jump 
on the Gators track and ﬁ  eld team as a fresh-man in 2009 and again in 2011, the family , youth and community sciences senior won a 
silver medal in the triple jump and a bronze 
medal in the long jump at the 2012 London Olympic Games this summer.Claye became the ﬁ  rst 
athlete to win medals in 
both events in the same 
Olympics since 1936.
Today , Claye will receive 
another award, but it won’t 
be one he can bring home.
Mayor Craig Lowe will 
honor him at 5:30 p.m. at 
City Hall.
“I think it’s important that Gainesville recognize those that go out in the world and make contributions and represent our city,” 
Lowe said.
Claye said he only recently learned the day 
would be dedicated to him, but the news came as a welcomed surprise.
“Every year when [Oct. 4] comes around, 
I’ll be like, ‘Shoot, its my day in Gainesville,’” Claye said. “That’s an honor. Not too many 
people can say that.”Mayor will honor UF student, Olympic medalist runner at City Hall

If Felipe Matos, an undocu-

tation order, he knows his hus-
band could try to keep him in the 
U.S.Matos, national ﬁ  eld director 
of GetEQUAL, a lesbian, gay, bi-
sexual and transgender equality 
organization, is among the cou-
ples affected by the Department of Homeland Security’s recent 
announcement that would ofﬁ  -
cially deﬁ  ne same-sex couples as families for the purposes of de-
portation orders.
“This is allowing families to 
stay together,” Matos said.
The decision was announced 
Thursday through letters sent to some Democratic lawmakers, 
The New York Times reported. In it, Secretary of the Department 
of Homeland Security Janet Na-
politano told Immigration and Customs Enforcement ofﬁ  cials to 
classify long-term same-sex re-
lationships as family in deporta-
tion cases.
Although the federal govern-
ment doesn’t recognize legal 
same-sex marriages because of 
the Defense of Marriage Act, 
this written policy considers the LGBT community for the ﬁ  rst 
time in federal immigration poli-
cies, Matos said. 
He married his husband, Juan 
Rodriguez, in May.
Lauren Hannahs, director of 
LGBT Affairs at UF, said this is a step toward equality, but it is 
deﬁ  nitely not a win.

Big Bird, the economy and a presidential boxing match got 
students riled up Wednesday night for the first presidential 
debate of the 2012 election cycle.
Democrats and Republicans gathered across the city to lis-
ten to President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney. From their respective watering holes, students and residents listened, cheered and jeered as the can-
didates discussed their policies and jabbed their competitor.
About 150 students and residents crowded into a room 
in the Reitz Union to sit on chairs and on the floor when the 
space was filled to watch CNN on a projector screen at the Gators for Obama event. 
About 100 students and residents gathered at Outback 
Steakhouse on Archer Road to watch CSPAN on flat-screen TVs and munch on burgers and Bloomin’ Onions, hosted by the Alachua County Republican Party. 
“Nothing is really more American than a presidential de-
bate,” said Gators for Obama co-chairwoman Christina Ford, a 20-year-old economics and political science sophomore.
Voters on both sides of the aisle said this election feels per -
sonal.
For Jakeila Stringer, UF College Democrats Black Caucus 
chairwoman, it hits home. The 25-year-old journalism fresh-man credits her opportunity to attend college to the Pell grant.
State Representative Dennis Baxley, a Republican, said he 
thinks a lot of young voters have become disillusioned with Obama, and he doesn’t want to give the next generation a di-minished future.“The future is everything to me,” he said.As the debate neared, the Republican group counted down 
the last 10 seconds until the words started flowing.
Early in the debate, Obama did a shout-out to the first lady 
on the evening of their 20th wedding anniversary, causing the Democratic side to swoon and the Republican side to “aww.”
“There are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the 
most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth, because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me,” 
he said. “And so I just want to wish, sweetie, you, happy an-
niversary, and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.”
The debate quickly heated up as topics ping-ponged from 
the economy to health care to small businesses.
When the debate turned to government funding, Romney 
said he plans to stop subsidies to Public Broadcasting Ser -
vice.
“I’m going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I’m going to stop 
other things. I like PBS. I love Big Bird,” Romney said. “I’m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for.”
Republican supporters hooted and cheered, drowning out 
the blaring televisions. Democrats gasped, laughed and jeered at the comment.
But between jabs about Donald Trump, Obamacare and 
Romney’s tax plan, students rallied their respective candi-dates side-by-side with their fellow supporters and on social 
media.
Political science senior Rafael Escobedo, 22, watched the 
television screen with enthusiastic attention. He said he’s 
been waiting for this day since May.
“This is my Super Bowl,” he said.

Kittens wearing bow ties, tiny giraffes and 
sleepy sloths could make students more pro-
ductive.
A study titled “The Power of Kawaii” — 
“kawaii” means “cute” in Japanese — found 
that looking at pictures of attractive animals 
results in higher performance.
Researchers showed Japanese university 
students pictures of baby animals and had them complete a variety of tasks. Factors like their fine motor skills, reaction times and attention spans showed up to a 44 percent improvement from when they viewed adult dogs and cats.
Neil Rowland, professor and chairman of 
the UF psychology department, said the find-ings could be due to the mood cute pictures 
induce.
Certain cognitive stimuli place people into 
a particular frame of mind. While the anxiety 
and tension sometimes caused by exams may lead to poor performance for some students, positive stimuli that reduce stress may en-hance it, he said.
“When you see a picture of a puppy or a 
cute infant, then very often you feel sort of 
warm and fuzzy and sort of relaxed,” Row-
land said, “and so you might go into the sub-sequent task in a fairly sort of relaxed state.”
But not all students associate looking at 
pictures of adorable animals with increased productivity.
Zoology junior David Boyd, 20, said he 
sometimes encounters the pictures on web-sites he visits to waste time.
“If I’m at the point where I’m looking at 
pictures of a wombat shaking someone’s hand, I’m not in a productive stage of the af-ternoon or evening,” he said.Cuteness could 
increase focus
“When you see a picture of a pup-
py or a cute infant, then very often 
you feel sort of warm and fuzzy and 
sort of relaxed and so you might go 
into the subsequent task in a fairly 
sort of relaxed state.”
Neil Rowland
UF psychology professorsity says it is.”
The other referendum asked 
students whether they wanted 
UF to continue with the removal 
of independently owned newspa-per racks from campus. 
About 60 percent of the 6,939 
students who voted opposed it.
“I think that’s an important 
result,” Bradshaw said. “I think it shows that despite what our opponents have been saying, the Alligator is an important source of news on our campus.”
UF students had two days to 
vote for 50 student senators. 
The Students Party nominated 
48 students, and the Swamp Par -
ty nominated 50.
“It’s good to see that Gators 
are engaged,” said Student Body President Tj Villamil.
Several students were incor -
rectly placed in District E, which includes all ZIP codes not in the 
other four districts, due to their 
addresses listed in the university registrar.While voting, students were 
asked three times to verify their district. 
If it was incorrect, they could 
digitally sign an affidavit and add their correct addresses. 
The ZIP codes were listed on 
all district confirmation pages starting at noon Tuesday, Davis said.
Landesberg said he hadn’t 
seen the numbers as of press time 
and didn’t know how incorrectly 
registered students affected the vote.
This is the third semester using 
online voting and the second se-
mester using the online system to vote based on students’ residential districts.
As of midnight Wednesday, 
eight elections complaints had 
been filed: five from the Students Party and three from the Swamp 
Party, said Elections Commission 
chairman Wes Stephens. 
The Elections Commission will 
meet today to hear them.
In addition, three complaints 
were already handled. 
The results of the elections are 
not in effect until the Senate offi-cially validates them Tuesday.

AnimALS

A bald eagle under the care of the 
UF Small Animal Hospital was re-
leased to a rehab center Wednesday.
Bacon, the 5-year-old adult male 
bald eagle, was admitted three 
weeks ago. He was in poor condi-
tion when he was found in Suwan-nee County.
Bacon suffered bone fractures, 
one of which was aligned and an-other that required surgery to hold the bone together. To keep him calm and avoid re-injury while being ex-amined, Bacon was given acupunc-
ture twice to control the pain. Five 
acupuncture needles were used to sedate him to allow the team of vets 
to examine him.
The needles, which were de-
signed for human hands, were 0.1 
millimeter in diameter.
Dr. Justin Shmalberg, a clinical 
assistant professor of integrative medicine, administered the acu-puncture.
“He freely let us manipulate the 
wing and place him on his back when needles were present, and he would often relax his posture during the treatment,” Shmalberg wrote in an email.
However, when five pictures 
of Bacon receiving treatment were posted on the college’s Facebook last week, some of the viewers didn’t agree with the procedure.
People commented: “Madden-
ing. Sad. Frustrating.”; “At least humans have a choice of not having 
pins stuck in them.”; and “What is 
this madness?”
But treating animals with acu-
puncture is nothing new. UF rou-tinely performs acupuncture on thousands of animals annually , Shmalberg wrote.
According to the American 
Academy of Veterinary Acupunc-
ture in Hygiene, Colo., and the In-
ternational V eterinary Acupuncture Society , it can alleviate pain and has been a treatment for degenerative joint disease, respiratory problems and neurological and urinary tract disorders. Acupuncture is common among arthritic dogs and cats, and is popular for horses.
Sarah Carey, director of public re-
lations for the College of Veterinary Medicine, said she was surprised by the feedback, and that there was dis-cussion over deleting the pictures.
“My initial reaction was that this 
was a unique opportunity to share some of the cool things we do here,” Carey said. “It’s just not that often that you get to see these beautiful bald eagles.” 
Before being released to the 
Audubon Center for Birds of Prey in Maitland, Bacon was “standing, eat-ing and displaying normal behavior for a wild eagle in captivity,” Shmal-berg wrote.
Shmalberg stands by his decision 
to use acupuncture despite the Face-book controversy. But, he wrote, he 
values the commenters’ input.
“We obviously don’t insert nee-
dles, no matter how small, or handle 
any animals without consideration of the risks and benefits,” Shmalberg wrote.

portunity to share some of

� THE LAW COMES 
AFTER THE PENN STATE ABUSE SCANDAL. 
SAMANTHA BLACK
Alligator Contributing Writer
Reporting child abuse is no 
longer only a moral duty. It can 
now result in a $1 million fine 
for people who knowingly fail 
to report abuse.
On Monday, a new state 
law went into effect that cracks 
down on reporting child abuse 
and assists child abuse victims. The law includes fines of up to $1 million for universities and a felony charge for individuals 
who fail to report abuse.
The additions made Florida 
the state toughest toward child 
abuse, said Erin Gillespie, 
spokeswoman for Florida 
Department of Children and Families.
Gillespie said the push for 
the new legislation is credited 
largely to the Pennsylvania 
State University abuse scan-dal.
She said the law change 
requires people to report sus-pected abuse by any person to a child. Previously, people could only make a report if the child’s parent or guardian was 
the suspected abuser.
“Child abuse is higher than 
we know,” she said. “It just 
hasn’t been reported.”
The offense of refusing to 
report child abuse used to be a misdemeanor, but under this law, it is classified as a third-degree felony. Gillespie said 
this means the punishments are harsher, and the jail time is 
longer for those who commit the crime.
Every allegation will go 
through an investigation, in-cluding an interview with the child, parents, teachers, neigh-
bors and anyone else who 
could make accurate observa-tions about the child’s well-being.
Gillespie said Aventura-
based Lauren’s Kids, a non-profit organization that strives to prevent abuse and to heal surviving victims, was in-
strumental to getting this law 
passed.
“Lauren brought the prob-
lem to light,” said Jessica Clark, senior account execu-
tive for Lauren’s Kids. “Aside 
from laws, she wants to teach kids to be their own line of de-fense.”
Lauren’s Kids mandated 
a new curriculum in the law requiring kindergarten classes to teach children what are safe and unsafe secrets and whom 
they can trust to talk to.
“The kids are picking it up 
well,” Gillespie said, noting 
that Tallahassee schools have 
implemented the curriculum. 
“They are very aware of good and bad secrets.”
Gillespie said indicators 
of a physically abused child 
include bruises, broken bones

The other referendum asked 
students whether they wanted 
UF to continue with the removal 
of independently owned newspa-per racks from campus. 
About 60 percent of the 6,939 
students who voted opposed it.
“I think that’s an important 
result,” Bradshaw said. “I think it shows that despite what our opponents have been saying, the Alligator is an important source of news on our campus.”
UF students had two days to 
vote for 50 student senators. 
The Students Party nominated 
48 students, and the Swamp Par -

“It’s good to see that Gators

Several students were incor -

other four districts, due to their 
addresses listed in the university registrar.While voting, students were 
asked three times to verify their district. 
If it was incorrect, they could 
digitally sign an affidavit and add their correct addresses. 
The ZIP codes were listed on

Landesberg said he hadn’t

AnimALS

A bald eagle under the care of the 
UF Small Animal Hospital was re-
leased to a rehab center Wednesday.
Bacon, the 5-year-old adult male 
bald eagle, was admitted three 
weeks ago. He was in poor condi-
tion when he was found in Suwan-nee County.
Bacon suffered bone fractures, 
one of which was aligned and an-other that required surgery to hold the bone together. To keep him calm and avoid re-injury while being ex-amined, Bacon was given acupunc-
ture twice to control the pain. Five 
acupuncture needles were used to sedate him to allow the team of vets 
to examine him.
The needles, which were de-
signed for human hands, were 0.1 
millimeter in diameter.
Dr. Justin Shmalberg, a clinical 
assistant professor of integrative medicine, administered the acu-puncture.
“He freely let us manipulate the 
wing and place him on his back when needles were present, and he would often relax his posture during the treatment,” Shmalberg wrote in an email.
However, when five pictures 
of Bacon receiving treatment were posted on the college’s Facebook last week, some of the viewers didn’t agree with the procedure.
People commented: “Madden-
ing. Sad. Frustrating.”; “At least humans have a choice of not having 
pins stuck in them.”; and “What is 
this madness?”
But treating animals with acu-
puncture is nothing new. UF rou-tinely performs acupuncture on thousands of animals annually , Shmalberg wrote.
According to the American 
Academy of Veterinary Acupunc-
ture in Hygiene, Colo., and the In-
ternational V eterinary Acupuncture Society , it can alleviate pain and has been a treatment for degenerative joint disease, respiratory problems and neurological and urinary tract disorders. Acupuncture is common among arthritic dogs and cats, and is popular for horses.
Sarah Carey, director of public re-
lations for the College of Veterinary Medicine, said she was surprised by the feedback, and that there was dis-cussion over deleting the pictures.
“My initial reaction was that this 
was a unique opportunity to share some of the cool things we do here,” Carey said. “It’s just not that often that you get to see these beautiful bald eagles.” 
Before being released to the 
Audubon Center for Birds of Prey in Maitland, Bacon was “standing, eat-ing and displaying normal behavior for a wild eagle in captivity,” Shmal-berg wrote.
Shmalberg stands by his decision 
to use acupuncture despite the Face-book controversy. But, he wrote, he 
values the commenters’ input.
“We obviously don’t insert nee-
dles, no matter how small, or handle 
any animals without consideration of the risks and benefits,” Shmalberg wrote.

� THE LAW COMES 
AFTER THE PENN STATE ABUSE SCANDAL. 
SAMANTHA BLACK
Alligator Contributing Writer
Reporting child abuse is no 
longer only a moral duty. It can 
now result in a $1 million fine 
for people who knowingly fail 
to report abuse.
On Monday, a new state 
law went into effect that cracks 
down on reporting child abuse 
and assists child abuse victims. The law includes fines of up to $1 million for universities and a felony charge for individuals 
who fail to report abuse.
The additions made Florida 
the state toughest toward child 
abuse, said Erin Gillespie, 
spokeswoman for Florida 
Department of Children and Families.
Gillespie said the push for 
the new legislation is credited 
largely to the Pennsylvania 
State University abuse scan-dal.
She said the law change 
requires people to report sus-pected abuse by any person to a child. Previously, people could only make a report if the child’s parent or guardian was 
the suspected abuser.
“Child abuse is higher than 
we know,” she said. “It just 
hasn’t been reported.”
The offense of refusing to 
report child abuse used to be a misdemeanor, but under this law, it is classified as a third-degree felony. Gillespie said 
this means the punishments are harsher, and the jail time is 
longer for those who commit the crime.
Every allegation will go 
through an investigation, in-cluding an interview with the child, parents, teachers, neigh-
bors and anyone else who 
could make accurate observa-tions about the child’s well-being.
Gillespie said Aventura-
based Lauren’s Kids, a non-profit organization that strives to prevent abuse and to heal surviving victims, was in-
strumental to getting this law 
passed.
“Lauren brought the prob-
lem to light,” said Jessica Clark, senior account execu-
tive for Lauren’s Kids. “Aside 
from laws, she wants to teach kids to be their own line of de-fense.”
Lauren’s Kids mandated 
a new curriculum in the law requiring kindergarten classes to teach children what are safe and unsafe secrets and whom 
they can trust to talk to.
“The kids are picking it up 
well,” Gillespie said, noting 
that Tallahassee schools have 
implemented the curriculum. 
“They are very aware of good and bad secrets.”
Gillespie said indicators 
of a physically abused child 
include bruises, broken bones 
and other visible harm. Sexu-ally abused children, who are more difficult to spot, tend to 
act out toward other children 
or become withdrawn. Ne-glected children tend to show signs of hunger or lack of hy-giene.New Florida law

AMBULANCE RIDES HAVE INCREASED.

University and city officials have 
been working to cut down drunken 
driving on campus and to aid ad-dicted students in seeking help. So far, officials say they’ve seen prog-
ress.
UF’s Community Alcohol Coali-
tion met Wednesday at Emerson 
Alumni Hall to present campus al-cohol statistics and to reveal plans to help students with alcohol-related issues such as an on-campus Alco-holics Anonymous group.
The statistics presented at the 
meeting were a combination of data from GatorWell, the Dean of Stu-dent’s office and University Police, said Maureen Miller, director of Ga-torWell Health Promotion Services.  
The number of on-campus 
drunken ambulance rides has in-
creased since the medical amnesty policy started last year, she said.
“That’s not necessarily a bad 
thing,” she said.
Rather, it means more students 
are willing to call for help when they 
drink too much.  
Police are educating city restau-
rants and bars about how to iden-
tify underage drinkers and pick out patrons who have had too much to 
drink, said GPD Lt. Brian Helmer -
son.
On campus, UF’s Counseling & 
Wellness Center offers a new recov-ery program for students addicted to alcohol, said Joan Scully , substance 
abuse coordinator for the Counsel-
ing and Wellness Center.She said suspended students can 
stay in school and have their records cleared if they successfully complete the program.
An AA chapter is being formed 
on campus in addition to work-shops, recovery support groups and 
psychotherapy groups.THURSDAY, OCTOBER 4, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 5

The county is considering 
moving forward with its plan 
to relocate the Alachua County 
Fairgrounds to a nearby spot, but 
some residents are worried about whether it’s a good idea to move the fairgrounds at all.
The county held a commu-
nity meeting Wednesday at the fairgrounds to discuss residents’ 
opinions and concerns about the 
current plan. The County Com-mission wants to move the fair -
grounds so it can develop the cur -
rent location next to Gainesville 
Regional Airport into an office, 
hotel and retail complex.
Acting County Manager Rich-
ard Drummond spoke to a room 
of about 50 people discussing 
the city’s plans to move the fair -grounds to either 
Weseman Tract, at Waldo Road and Northeast 63rd Avenue, or Gainesville 
Raceway, at 
11211 N. County Road 225.
“When we first started talk-
ing about moving, we just talked about redeveloping on this site,” Drummond said, “but it wasn’t 
sufficient with money.”
Some Alachua County resi-
dents were concerned about the 
fate of the fairgrounds, which hosts a variety of festivals each 
year including the Hoggetowne 
Medieval Faire.
Marihelen Wheeler, a 
Gainesville resident, asked 
Drummond whether anyone 
would buy space at the proposed complex.
“I can’t tell you someone’s 
knocking on my door to buy the property,” he replied. “But peo-ple in the industry say it’s a vi-able location.”
There were other concerns 
brought up at the meeting, includ-ing whether the county would improve utilities and build a fire 
department in the area to attract 
businesses to the complex. Some residents wary about plan to move fairgrounds

About 90 students will come 
together to play three pieces at 
the “Scheherazade!” concert at 
7:30 p.m. in the University Au-ditorium.
UF’s Symphony Orchestra 
has rehearsed about 20 hours 
throughout the past two months 
in preparation, orchestra presi-dent Will Teegarden said. The concert is free to students.
“It’s wonderful to see what 
happens when UF students who share a love and passion for music come together to make something beautiful,” 
said the 21-year-old music per -
formance junior. 
The main piece is by Rus-
sian composer Nikolai Rimsky-
Korsakov , said professor of 
music performance Raymond 
Chobaz, who will conduct the orchestra at the concert.
The music alludes to the tale 
of a Persian prince who weds and kills a new woman each night to avenge his disloyal first wife. But one princess, Schehe-razade, breaks the spell by tell-ing a never ending story.
Other pieces the orches-
tra will perform at the concert include Charles Tomlinson 
Griffes’ “The Pleasure of Kubla 
Khan” and Camille Saint-Saëns’ “Violin Concerto No. 3 in B Mi-nor.”
Soloist and UF violin profes-
sor Janna Lower said the three works represent the romantic genre.
“This is basically a retelling 
of legends in musical form,” Teegarden said. “It’s the same premise as going home and 
watching a Disney movie you 
haven’t seen in a while, because it’s exotic and yet familiar to you.”UF orchestra to play

Why everything doesn’t 
have to be go-go-go
We care about the most important issues that impact our 
readers. We want to make sure that we keep you as in-formed on the most up-to-date, top-of-the-line, state-
of-the-art news as possible.
That’s why we think you need to know about the latest 
study.
It’s titled “The Power of Kawaii: Viewing Cute Images Pro-
motes a Careful Behavior and Narrows Attentional Focus.” Yes, it means exactly what you think it does.
Welcome to the world of the Internet. It’s either a dangerous 
Web to navigate or a wonderful world to explore.
This study is the latter. It claims that people who looked at 
baby animals were more productive at tasks requiring focus.
Do you realize what this means?
It means we have an excuse. It means we can look at all the 
cute photos we want, all in the name of productivity.
“The students attempted the task three times; the ﬁ  rst after 
looking at a series of pictures of baby animals, then after see-
ing adult animals and ﬁ  nally after seeing pictures of delicious foods,” according to a Hufﬁ  ngton Post article. 
Maybe the point is to take more breaks when doing work 
or studying for a test. The human brain probably isn’t wired to work on something for an extended period of time, and cute ani-
mals are one of the best distractions.
“This study shows that viewing cute things improves subse-
quent performance in tasks that require behavioral carefulness, 
possibly by narrowing the breadth of attentional focus,” said the study’s researchers at Hiroshima University . 
“Web browsing can actually refresh tired workers and en-
hance their productivity, compared to other activities such as making personal calls, texts or emails, let alone working straight through with no rest at all,” said a 2011 Wall Street Journal ar-
ticle. People “usually choose to visit only the sites that they like 
— it’s like going for a coffee or snack break. Breaks of such na-ture are pleasurable, rejuvenating the Web surfer,” wrote one of the authors of the “Impact of Cyberloaﬁ  ng on Psychological Engagement” study, Vivien K.G. Lim wrote in an email, accord-ing to the WSJ article.
So what we gather from these two articles is that we are en-
couraged to browse the Internet and to look at cute pictures of baby animals, because it will help us complete the tasks that we 
need to get done.
This doesn’t mean you can blow off class and work to stay 
online all day. It emphasizes the importance of taking breaks.
We all need a break every now and then.
That’s why we’re running this editorial in the middle of one 
of the most hectic and government-ﬁ  lled weeks of the semester.
You deserve a break, and so do we.So, when you’re done reading this, chill out and relax.There’s no need to be angry for the entire week.
People are allowed to have different opinions, but let’s not 
ﬁ  ght about them all the time.
Go ﬁ  nd a list of cute baby animal photos. There are plenty of 
them out there.Healthy living needs positive reinforcement
First lady Michelle Obama has been ﬁ  ghting childhood 
obesity since her husband claimed the Oval Ofﬁ  ce four years ago. She has taken great strides and has inspired 
many young people through her speeches and programs across America.
But, there is one thing that needs to be tweaked. Instead 
of looking to end child obesity , the ﬁ  rst lady should be preaching the start of healthy lifestyles.
People, especially children, respond best to positive re-
inforcement.
The students of Wallace County High School in Sharon 
Springs, Kan. are proof of this.
In 2010, Congress passed a law that requires high school 
cafeterias to serve meals containing 750 to 850 calories. They 
must also serve twice the amount of vegetables and fruits 
and reduce portions of proteins and carbohydrates.
This made for some not-so-happy teenagers. So, they re-
sponded with a parody of Fun’s “We are Young,” that pro-claims, “We are Hungry.” The latest YouTube sensation has more than half a million views.
People have never responded well to limits placed on 
them. No one likes to be told what to do, especially when it should be a personal choice.
For example, the government gave in when it could no 
longer control the people after 13 years of Prohibition.
Students who eat fried food and sweets for lunch are no 
different from the grown men who drank alcohol every day before Prohibition. 
The outcome will ultimately be the same, as history al-
ways repeats itself.
Weight is not the deﬁ  ning characteristic of health. People, 
including children, can have a variety of underlying health 
problems that are affected by eating behaviors. Obese people 
are not the only ones who have diabetes and cardiovascular problems.
If the ultimate goal is to end childhood obesity, then soci-
ety loses sight of what a healthy lifestyle is all about. Crash diets, rigorous workouts and fat-diminishing surgeries all give the illusion of health but are quite contrary to that. 
For many American children, a school lunch is their only meal in a day. It’s not right to limit what they are allowed to place on their trays as they proceed through the lunch line. The gov-ernment has no way to measure 
how empty their stomachs are.
Obesity suggests a person 
must lose a set amount of weight 
to fall into a normal weight range. This insinuates that obesity is a problem that society must ﬁ  x, in-
stead of allowing people to be comfortable with their own bodies.
By limiting food intake, the government is judging peo-
ple who fall into the obese weight range.
As mentioned before, the calorie law also placed re-
straints on the amount of protein and carbohydrates for stu-dents in the lunchroom.
All food is good in moderation. It would prove more ben-
eﬁ  cial to teach these children healthy guidelines than to give them smaller portions for no reason.
Children, especially high school students, need a large 
amount of calories each day. They are studying, playing 
and doing many other things that burn a large amount of 
calories. Unlike adults, who are no longer growing, children need more nutrients to fuel their bodies.
Placing a limitation on calories gives children the impres-
sion that the amount of calories they consume in a day is signiﬁ  cant. Rather, the amount of time spent being active and eating all foods in moderation is the key to achieving a healthy lifestyle.
The word “obese” should never be used to describe a 
child, because he or she is still growing. A child needs a well-balanced diet.
Ultimately, placing a maximum amount of calories al-
lowed per meal in school cafeterias will never be a long-term solution to obesity if the students are not taught how to make healthy choices.

If you bring in three books, you 
get half off your bar tab. Sold.
The Library, a bar and lounge 
located in the space previous-
ly occupied by Market Street Pub, 120 SW First Ave., opened about a month ago in downtown 
Gainesville. 
Right now, they serve only 
beer and wine, but a food license 
is in the works, and a menu is be-ing created, said Karry Kreiger, 
manager.
The bar is spacious and wait-
ing for books to fill in the empty 
spaces to serve as decor and read-
ing material for its patrons. 
Kreiger greeted many of his 
customers by first name and was 
introduced to a girl’s parents who were visiting from out of town. 
Though quiet for a Saturday 
night, the chatter from the bar was lively and welcoming.
 The Library hasn’t advertised 
yet and consider the past month a soft opening, with plans for a grand opening in the near future.
The bar is two stories. The 
Wine Cellar is located on the first floor where they offer beer, wine and sangria. 
The top floor is home to the 
Wine Attic where they serve bot-
tled wine by the glass.
Kreiger said they really enjoy 
talking about the wine and beer 
with the customers, educating 
them and helping them find what 
they like. 
Right now, they have 225 types 
of beer and 45 wines, but the goal 
is to have more than 500 beers and 
100 wines to choose from. It costs $8 to taste six wines.
“If they’re into it, I keep pour -
ing,” Kreiger said of the tasting.
The Library is owned by Kreiger’s family, who have been in the food and beverage industry for three generations. 
The family owns two other 
bars, one in St. Augustine and one in Pittsburgh. 
He said they chose downtown 
Gainesville because of the many improvements they see happen-ing in the area and the customer base consisting of students, pro-
fessionals and locals.
Kreiger said one of their goals 
is to connect customers with what 
they enjoy by also offering whole 
bottles or even cases of the wine they serve. 
All craft beers are $4, and wines 
vary in price but are generally $7 to $8 a glass.
The Library is open Wednes-
day through Sunday from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m.THURSDAY, OCTOBER 4, 2012

Nothing says Halloween like pig blood, 
tacky 1970s prom-wear and telekinetic pow-
ers.  
This Halloween season, you might even 
get a laugh out of it.
“Carrie,” a comedy by Erik Jackson based 
on the novel by Stephen King, promises a 
bloody good time to audiences looking for a 
twist on the classic story.
The show begins Oct. 12 at the Hippo-
drome State Theatre, 25 SE Second Place, and will run through Nov. 4. Discount pre-
views will be Oct. 10 and 11. Regular tickets 
are $35 and student tickets are $15.
“Carrie” will show eight times a week. 
For specific times and prices, visit the Hip-
podrome’s website, www.thehipp.org.
The story revolves around social outcast 
Carrie White, a victim of bullying at school, 
and her overtly religious mother at home. Carrie finally gets a chance to attend the 
prom when things take a bloody turn, and 
she decides to take revenge on everyone via her telekinetic abilities.
“Carrie” will take the audience in a new 
direction, poking fun at the outlandish ele-ments of the story.
“This rendition of ‘Carrie’ is light hearted, 
fun, campy, quirky,” said Jessica Kreitzer, assistant costume designer for the produc-tion.
The younger actors, the time period and 
the costumes give it a lighter feel, she said.
Director Lauren Caldwell said she ex-
pects the play to draw a diverse crowd, from high school students to adults who saw the film when it premiered in 1976.
“When I was a kid, that movie came out, 
so I remember it. So I think it’s going to ap-
peal to people my age who remember the 
book, remember the film and who are going 
to come and say, ‘How in the world are they going 
to put that on stage?’” 
Caldwell said.  “I think it has a very wide appeal to different ages.”
Chelsea Sorenson, a 
senior acting major who plays the lead role, Carrie, said she expects the student audience to be drawn to the show.
“I mean, the amount of times we drop the 
F-bomb is crazy,” she said. “It’s a lot of re-ally, really crude humor, so I feel it’s some -
thing a younger audience will really enjoy.”
The show has not come without its chal-
lenges, though.
For one, there is the pig blood, which de-
fines the story’s iconic scene.
“Trying not to douse everyone on stage 
has been the biggest challenge,” Sorenson 
said.
In the costume department, costume de-signer Marilyn Wall said she has been trying 
several different mixes for the blood.
The clothes had to be made to resist large 
amounts of faux blood every night, which can be cleaned quickly for the next show, 
Wall said.
Caldwell said some things have been 
built and rigged for the production, but it 
has been fun to figure out how to make it 
enjoyable for the audience.
Another major challenge has been creat-
ing comedy in the bullying aspects of the 
story.     “You have to find that happy median 
between it’s believable that she really is up-set, but it’s not so bad that people forget to laugh,” Sorenson said.
Even if it is outrageous, it’s hard not to 
feel bad for Carrie, she said.
Despite the humor, Sorenson said she 
hopes audiences will take something away from the play.
“I really think the story lends itself to 
a lesson — that whole be careful who you mess with,” she said. “One day you are go-ing to mess with the wrong person.”8, ALLIGATOR �THURSDAY , OCTOBER 4, 2012

Lost in an endlessly growing 
queue and buried beneath thou-
sands of rows of titles, there are a 
few hidden Netflix gems.
“In the Loop” (2009)
Directed by Armando Iannucci,106 min, NR
Armando Iannucci is the king of  
political satire. The British direc-
tor and writer for  “Veep” and “In the Thick of It,” pulls no punches when illustrating an absurd group 
of bureaucrats in the film “In the 
Loop.”“In the Loop” is set before the 
United States and United King-dom’s invasion of Iraq. The film 
starts out with the two countries 
keeping a tight lid on their desires to go to war. However, not every-one in the government is as keen to go to war.
After the British secretary of 
state for international develop-ment, Simon Foster (played by Tom Hollander of “Pirates of the Carib-
bean”), talks on the radio about 
the impossibility of a war in the fu-ture, politicians and bureaucrats in the U.S. and the U.K. scramble to downplay his statements, manipu-lating him and his words to build 
a case against 
war.
I a n n u c c i 
portrays the politics of “In 
the Loop” in 
a vulgar and crass fashion. It has ultra-
combative and foul-mouthed char -
acters like the director of commu -
nications for the prime minister, Malcolm Tucker (Peter Capaldi of “The Thick of It”), and Lt. Gen. Miller, U.S. senior military as-
sistant to the secretary of defense 
(James Gandolfini of “The Sopra-nos”).
The film’s focus on characters 
with less-than-prestigious titles 
like “U.S. assistant secretary of 
state for diplomacy” adds a layer of absurdity to the character’s sto-ry. The influence they try to exhibit 
hardly reaches outside whichever 
room they are in, although they act as though it can reach the highest government levels.
Fast-paced and witty, this mov-
ie is probably the funniest film I 
have seen on Netflix. If you’re a fan 
of political satire, the HBO series “Veep,” starring Julia Louis-Drey-fus, or black comedies in general, “In the Loop” is a perfect choice.
Awesome hidden movie you’ve 
already seen: 
“Jumanji” (1995)
Perfect for those moments when 
you feel nostalgic about board 
games coming to life.

Dear Mediocre Advice,
How do you get rid of flies?Dear Mediocre Advice,
Do you think there’s a reason why 
most guys decide to just ignore girls instead of just balling-up and saying, “Hey, I don’t want to sleep with you 
anymore”?
Dear Friend, 
Telling the blunt truth will hurt a girl’s feelings, and most guys don’t want to be the cause of that. They could ignore you, and then you just assume they’re an a-hole, or they could tell you to your face that they don’t want to hook-up anymore and feel like an a-hole. I’d choose the option with less work. Also, being honest is really hard. As crappy as it is, it’s easier to avoid the whole chore. It’s not just guys, though. Girls have done this to guys plenty of times. Being honest is hard. That’s why sh*t-talking is so 
easy.Dear Friend, 
I can tell you’ve already Googled it. Take out the garbage more often or remove the dead body from your basement. But don’t 
think of them as a something to get rid of. 
Think of them as little people who are try -
ing to get close to your face because they 
want to tell you secrets.Dear Mediocre Advice,
I ride a bike on campus, and I hate people 
who don’t get out of the way. Most of them have their headphones in and don’t even hear 
me. What do I do or say to make them move?
Dear Friend, 
The problem is that students are unaware of the sound a bike makes. All you can do is yell “Behind you!” People should always keep one earphone out to listen for this. Anyone who doesn’t deserves to get salmoned. What’s sal -
moning? It’s when you come behind someone and slap your hand between their thighs really fast like a salmon. Next time someone makes 
you stop, salmon them and pretend it wasn’t 
you. They won’t know who did it, because they were unaware of their surroundings by having 
both earphones in. That’s justice in my book. Dear Mediocre Advice,
Is it acceptable to eat Brie and Ritz 
crackers? Or does the cheese out 
class the cracker?
Dear Friend,
Don’t underestimate the Ritz cracker, 
fool. This column is provided by Ariel Barnes, a 21-year-old majoring in international studies. Would

Dancing in the Dark
A spirited festival-goer dances at CounterPoint music festival in Atlanta, Ga., Thursday.  The three-day 
electronic-dance-music festival featured artists such as Bassnectar, Skrillex and Pretty Lights.
  
◗ THE FEST WILL BE OCT. 
26 TO OCT. 28.
MIKE LLERENA
Avenue Contributing Writer
The memory of Fest 10 is 
firmly ingrained in the mind 
of Matt Hodge, who volun-
teered at the event last Octo-
ber.
One night, Hodge went to 
have a drink at The Top and 
ran into Fest organizer Tony Weinbender. The two became acquainted and started talk-ing.
Hodge told Weinbender 
how much Gainesville’s famed punk rock festival meant to him. Weinbender re-ciprocated, saying how much the efforts of the Fest volun-teers meant to him.
The Fest, which is in its 
11th year, will take place at 12 local venues from Oct. 26 until Oct. 28.
Last week, the Fest staff 
held a meeting with volun-teers looking to help out at this year’s event.
After the meeting, the staff 
said it still had 38 volunteer spots open. There will be an 
additional meeting Oct. 9 at 7 
p.m. at the Holiday Inn  to fill the spots.
“I didn’t realize [volunteer -
ing] was going to be so fun,” Hodge, 22, said. 
One of the major incentives 
for volunteers to work at the event is the free pass. Volun-teers are awarded a free Fest 
weekend pass for every shift 
they work, Weinbender said. Shifts are 8 to 10 hours long, and weekend passes cost $100. Volunteers are also given an exclusive T-shirt, designed solely for the volunteer staff.
Weinbender, 36, said that 
there are four types of jobs available to volunteers: stage 
manager, security, doors and 
stagehands.
Volunteers working at the 
doors will check to make sure festival-goers entering the venue have wristbands. Se-curity volunteers will stand between the band and the 
audience, maintaining con-
trol of the crowd. Stagehands will deal directly with the bands, helping them to load their equipment and set up the stage. Stage managers will oversee the bands and the oth-
er volunteers.
The meeting concluded in 
less than an hour, and swarms 
of volunteers flocked to the schedule board to secure jobs at their desired shows.
This year, Hodge looks to 
reprise his position as a stage-hand. 
Thor Richardt, 21, is also a 
first-time volunteer. 
“It’s not run like Warped 
Tour or a lot of other music festivals,” Richardt said. “It’s really locally run, and you can tell that there is a lot of com-munity going on in it. That’s 
just something you have to re-
spect and appreciate.”
He said the Fest plays a big 
role in making sure that fans 
of the punk-rock genre are 
represented. He is also excited to work alongside the bands and experience more of the management aspect of con-certs.
“As long as I’m in 
Gainesville, I feel like I’m go-ing to try to help out with Fest and push the music scene,” Richardt said. “The eventuali-ty is that I do plan on possibly opening my own record label 
and throwing my own music 
festivals. And this is all really good experience I could defi-nitely use to do that.”
Without the volunteers, 
Weinbender said putting on the festival would be impos-
sible. 
“This festival couldn’t 
exist if everyone who was 
working it was paid, because we wouldn’t be able to have 360-something bands,” Wein-bender said. “We would cut it down drastically.”
Fest volunteers are not 
without their success stories. 
Brian Forst, a guitar tech-
nician/stagehand for promi-nent bands like Less than Jake and New Found Glory, got his start in music volunteering at Fest 6, according to Wein-bender. 
Whether it’s attending the 
Fest for free or the prospect of 
networking with your favorite 
band, Weinbender noted the 
benefits of volunteering for 
the Fest during the meeting.

The first of the Presidential debates aired Wednesday , 
but the truly thrilling political warfare is on Showtime’s 
returning hit drama “Homeland.” The show’s second 
season debuted Sunday , and fans all over America were 
shocked to discover what secrets were revealed.
Last season, Carrie Mathison, a bipolar CIA agent, be-
came obsessed with the idea that an American prisoner 
of war was “turned” into a terrorist by al-Qaida forces.
Sergeant Nicholas Brody was indeed “turned” while 
held hostage, but not in the way we were led to believe.
While captive, Brody taught a terrorist’s son to speak 
English. He developed a bond with the boy and secretly adopted the child’s religion as his own.
Brody’s newfound faith remained strong, even after 
returning to America. Secretly using Islamic prayers and 
his fame, the sergeant won a seat in Congress.
Expect Brody to climb the political ladder even fur -
ther, because Sunday’s premiere hinted at an invitation to run as vice president. But that invitation may be re-scinded now that it is coming to light that the American 
war hero “turned” Muslim.
New storylines create new theories to unravel, so this 
season will likely be as successful as its predecessor.
Besides breaking ratings records, 
the freshman season of “Home-land” earned two Emmy awards, 
for outstanding drama series and 
outstanding writing. The show 
also won best drama series brag-ging rights from the Golden Globes 
and the Critic’s Choice Television 
Awards.
Lead actress Claire Danes took 
home an Emmy , Golden Globe and Critic’s Choice 
Award for her role as Carrie Mathison.
English actor Damian Lewis received an Emmy for 
his portrayal of Sgt. Nicholas Brody.
“Homeland” airs on Showtime Sundays at 10 p.m.Award-winning thriller returns ‘home’

� THE DUO WILL PERFORM 
AT CLUB STEREO FRIDAY.
KENDRICK DANTE BROWN
Avenue Contributing Writer
Group drink specials and 3D 
stage designs will complement elec-
tronic dance music Friday night at 
Club Stereo. 
EOTO will headline the night’s 
concert with a three-hour, mostly 
improvised set.
According to its website, EOTO is 
a West Coast-based duo comprised 
of Michael Travis and Jason Hann. 
On its Bass Invaders tour, EOTO 
is using the tagline “All Improvised, All the Time!” to describe its non-
scripted, freestyle performances.
A part of that innovative per -formance technology is the Lotus 
Stage, an interactive 3D platform 
that displays psychedelic and na-
ture-inspired visuals while EOTO performs. The stage has become one 
of this tour’s main attractions since 
its introduction earlier this year.
Journalism senior Samantha 
Doucette first be-
came a fan of the 
duo when she saw 
them perform at 
Blackwater Music 
Festival in Sep-
tember 2011.  
“I was in com-
plete awe that two live musicians were able to create such a diverse 
range of sounds,” said Doucette. 
“They know how to convey emotion 
in the most sincere way, and it’s not 
just happy emotion. They cover sad-ness, anger and darkness.”
When Doucette saw EOTO last 
year, the duo had not yet introduced the Lotus Stage.
“I’m really excited to see [the Lo-
tus Stage] because I’ve heard that it’s an exciting visual bonus with the 
music,” she said. 
Ticket packages are available for 
large groups, according to Matthew 
Zingler, co-founder of Dope Enter -
tainment, the show’s organizer.
Advance tickets, which cost $15, 
can be purchased at Swamp Dragon Tobacco & Gifts, 818 W. University Ave.
All EOTO concerts are recorded 
and made available as $10 down-
loads. Advance ticket purchasers 
will be able to redeem a free down-
load of the show.EOTO to bring improvised dance music“This festival couldn’t

Alligator Staff Writer
  
  Omar Hunter has been through two 
head coaches and three defensive coor-
dinators during his ﬁ  ve years at Florida. Throw in a national championship and a six-loss season, and he’s seen a lot in his 
time with the Gators.
  But the redshirt senior, who leads the 
team with 47 career appearances, still 
pushes himself in practice.
  After recording a career-high eight 
tackles against Kentucky on Sept. 22, Hunter earned Southeastern Conference Defensive Lineman of the Week — his ﬁ  rst SEC weekly award.
  “I actually noticed a huge, drastic 
change last week in his level of practice,” junior center Jonotthan Harrison said of Hunter’s performance during the bye week. “For whatever reason, he came out 
there and he’s completely locked in, say-
ing, ‘It’s time to work. It’s time to go.’ Ev-ery single play I’ve seen just outstanding effort out of him, even in practice as if it was a game.”
  As for the individual award, Hunter 
said he didn’t “care one bit.” He’s busy 
trying to improve.
  “With coach (Dan) Quinn and coach 
(Bryant) Young, we were able to put in 
extra work, whether it’s in the ﬁ  lm room or after practice on the ﬁ  eld,” Hunter said. “It’s really been helping me out a lot.”
  Hunter ﬁ  nished 2011 with 31 tackles 
and 2.5 tackles for a loss in 13 games. He’s already notched 17 tackles through the ﬁ  rst four weeks of 2012. Hunter hasn’t made a stop behind the line of scrimmage, but he feels like he’s helping the defense 
more than he has in the past.  “The only difference now is I’ve been 
making a few more plays, (and) having a 
few more opportunities to make plays,” Hunter said. “I’ve been capitalizing on those opportunities.”
  His coaches have taken notice.   Quinn, who arrived in Gainesville be-
fore last season, has seen Hunter increase his lower body strength, giving more push 
off the ball.
  “His pad level, his hand placement — 
all the things you’re looking for in a defen-
sive tackle, he’s been doing in practice,” Quinn said. “It’s carried over into the game. I think it’s a good message for all the players. The guys that are practicing the best, that’s really when your skills are improving and it’s able to carry over into 
the game easier.”
  Hunter is on pace to record 51 regular-
season tackles, 20 more than his previous career high. In the past eight seasons, only 
one Gators defensive tackle has eclipsed 50 tackles. Jaye Howard made 65 tackles in 2011.
  Florida faces a physical LSU team on 
Saturday. All three running backs expect-
ed to play for the Tigers weigh more than 
215 pounds. 
  Sophomore Kenny Hilliard, LSU’s lead-
ing rusher, tips the scales at 231 pounds.

 �JENKINS SUFFERED A RIGHT 
THUMB FRACTURE ON SEPT. 8.
  JOSH JURNOVOY
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  The Gators’ defense will have some 
reinforcements to help slow down the 
Tigers’ offense on Saturday.
  Starting weakside linebacker Jelani 
Jenkins, who suffered a fracture in his right thumb against Texas A&M on 
Sept. 8, is on track to play against LSU, 
coach Will Muschamp said on Wednes-
day.
  Muschamp does not expect Jenkins 
to be limited by his cast, which defen-sive coordinator Dan Quinn said would 
protect the injured thumb while allow-
ing mobility in some of his other ﬁ  n-
gers.  “He’ll play in all situations,” Mus-
champ said. “We wouldn’t necessarily limit him right now in my eyes as we 
move forward. If he can play, then he can play. That means he can play on ﬁ  rst 
and 10, he can play on third down.”
  Freshman Antonio Morrison and 
sophomore Mike Taylor have ﬁ  lled in 
for Jenkins. They have combined for 
30 tackles on the season, includ-
ing one for a 
loss each.
  A l t h o u g h 
Quinn was pleased with the production of the backups, he expects the defense 
to beneﬁ  t from 
Jenkins’ return.
  “Having Jelani back is going to add 
a lot of value for us,” Quinn said. “One, Linebacker to play with cast  FIRE JOE MORGAN
  Twenty-four minutes.
  If you’re reading this in class, celebrate 
with a subdued ﬁ  st pump if you’ve been 
sitting there for more than 24 minutes. You’re in 
the homestretch!
  It took me 24 minutes to shower, brush my 
teeth, get dressed and leave my apartment this morning. You can watch the “Gangnam Style” music video on YouTube nearly six times in 24 minutes. Believe me, I have thoroughly tested that number.
  Simply put, 24 minutes — or 1,440 seconds 
— is a long time.
  Now, add a second to that eternity. That’s 
how long LSU held onto the ball during the 
second half of the Tigers’ 41-11 dismantling of 
the Gators last season in Death Valley . 
  Granted, the game was out of hand at half-
time, but LSU controlled the line of scrimmage in the second half. The Tigers broke the Gators’ spirits in a slow, painful fashion.
  “We wore down as the game went (on) last 
year,” linebacker Jon Bostic said.
  The 13 seconds that elapsed on Jacoby Brissett’s 65-yard touchdown to Andre Debose marked the lone bright spot for the Gators’ offense in 
the second half. UF 
gained just 38 yards on its 13 other plays from scrimmage.
  Former LSU defensive back Tyrann Mathieu 
caught as many passes from Brissett (one) as UF’s receivers did during the second half.
  Meanwhile, the Tigers ran 21 of their 63 plays 
in the fourth quarter and piled on 14 points to complete the 30-point rout of the outmanned 
and overpowered Gators.
  “We got beat really bad,” nose tackle Omar 
Hunter said. “It was a sick feeling.”
  Let me throw out another number: 180. That 
represents the degree of change you will see in 
the line-of-scrimmage battle this time around.

of giving the ball to either Jeff Demps or Chris  UF will win line of scrimmage

stuff, and he’s a good blitzer.”
Muschamp also said that defensive end 
Dominique Easley, tight end Jordan Reed and Trey Burton will be active on Saturday. Reed left Florida’s 38-0 win against Kentucky on Sept. 22 with a likely concussion. Burton sat 
out with back spasms, while Easley missed 
the game due to swelling in his surgically re-paired left knee.
“He needed more time to come back,” 
Quinn said of Easley.  “He’s ready to go, and I’m anxious to get him back out there.”
Defensive tackle Sharrif Floyd also left 
the Gators’ victory against the Wildcats after suffering a shoulder injury. Floyd practiced 
during the bye week, and Quinn said on 
Wednesday that Floyd is expected to play on 
Saturday. 
On Tuesday, offensive coordinator Brent 
Pease said offensive tackle Chaz Green “should be available” after missing the past 
two games with an ankle injury.
Cornerback Cody Riggs and offensive 
tackle Matt Patchan will be out on Saturday, Muschamp said. Riggs suffered a fracture 
in his foot against the Aggies, and Patchan 
has yet to play this season due to a pectoral 
strain.Mad Hatter: Les Miles has not been shy about using tricks against Florida in recent years.
“They’ve shown they’re willing to take 
chances,” Quinn said. “That’s a style they have and one certainly they’ve earned by the 
success they’ve had.”
During LSU’s 41-11 win against UF in 
2011, Tigers punter Brad Wing scored a 52-yard touchdown on a fake punt before the play was called back due to an illegal cel-ebration. 
In 2010, the Tigers trailed the Gators 29-26 
late in the fourth quarter when they lined up for a game-tying 52-yard field goal. Rather 
than attempting the kick, holder Derek Hel-
ton threw a no-look pitch over his head to 
kicker Josh Jasper, who ran 5 yards for the 
first down. The Tigers scored the game-win-
ning touchdown later in the drive.
Quinn said the deception shouldn’t be an 
issue if each player keeps his assignment.
“You just have to be on it in terms of your 
communication and your job, keeping your 
eyes in the right spot,” Quinn said. 
Ignoring the past: Following last year’s loss 
to LSU, Florida’s season continued its down-
ward spiral. UF dropped consecutive games 
against Auburn and Georgia, extending its losing streak to four. 
“I feel like last year we were down on our -
selves, how we played, how we performed,” 
guard Jon Halapio said. “We just don’t want 
to feel like that ever again.”
While the blowout defeat may be tough to 
forget, Halapio said Florida isn’t letting the memory negatively affect its preparation this 
time around.
“Everybody has that mentality that it’s 
Round 2 for everybody that we played last 
year.”

everybody. Against the likes of Alabama and 
LSU, relying on that strategy was stupid.
However, the Gators have a legitimate 
ground game in 2012 led by north-south run-ner Mike Gillislee and a bigger offensive line. Gillislee has been clutch for Florida this sea-son and has proven he is more than capable of filling the workhorse role for the UF offense.
Coaches limited Gillislee to 13 carries 
against Kentucky, and the DeLand native got some much-needed rest during the bye week.  He should be ready to carry the offensive load on Saturday.
Offensive coordinator Brent Pease said 
Florida will not monitor Gillislee’s carries, 
and I applaud that strategy. The Gators 
should give Gilly the rock at least 20 times on Saturday.
“He’s 22, he’s got good youth in him,” 
Pease said. “Look at guys in the NFL. If a guy wants to play at the next level, he better be able to handle it 25 times a game. … Mike can handle that. Mike is good at avoiding people. He’s not taking direct hits. He knows how to 
protect himself, like any good running back.”
The Tigers rank third in the Southeastern 
Conference in rushing defense, but the best 
ground attack they have faced this season is North Texas’ 63rd-ranked unit.
LSU has talent along its defensive front 
seven. But heading into Game 6, the group is largely untested in 2012.
With the exception of leading rusher 
Kenny Hilliard, the Tigers are hurting on the other side of the ball. Preseason All-SEC first-teamer Alex Hurst switched from right to left tackle to replace All-SEC second-teamer Chris Faulk, who is out for the season with a knee injury . 
Fullback J.C. Copeland will play with a left 
leg injury, and running back Spencer Ware will play with a shoulder injury. Alfred Blue 
is likely out for the season with a knee injury . 
LSU, which relies on power running, will 
face its toughest defensive test so far short-
handed, with banged-up pieces in its ground game.
The return of Jelani Jenkins from a right 
thumb injury only bolsters Florida’s unit, which has benefited significantly from the contributions of freshmen linebackers Dante 
Fowler Jr. and Antonio Morrison.
Also, the Gators are hungry for turnovers, 
and the Tigers fumbled five times against 
Towson last weekend.
Florida may not knock off LSU this week-
end, but an inability to run the ball and control the clock will not be the Gators’ downfall.
Muschamp constantly emphasizes con-
trolling the line of scrimmage, and Florida 
has the personnel and the experience to win 
ugly.

Every offensive lineman on the ros-
ter, except two freshmen, weighs 300 
pounds or more. Hunter is Florida’s heaviest starting defensive lineman at 313 pounds.
“[The] offensive line is massive,” 
UF coach Will Muschamp said of LSU. “They’re huge. They come off and mash it.”
After the Tigers controlled the foot-
ball for more than 24 minutes in the 
second half of last year’s 30-point win 
in Baton Rouge, the 
Gators know physi-cality will be key on Saturday.
Hunter certainly 
factors into that. 
“Omar, I think, is going to have a 
real great game,” redshirt senior Buck linebacker Lerentee McCray said. “He’s going to come out and surprise a lot of people because we’re going to 
definitely establish the line of scrim-
mage.”
Said junior right guard Jon Halapio: 
“He has more urgency to him. You can see him leading the D-line. You can just see him fired up about everything in practice. Omar Hunter: He loves to 
hit. He loves hitting drills. He loves the 
combo drills. He loves all of that.”

After four seasons with an of-
fense reliant on the power run-ning game, LSU finally has a 
quarterback capable of leading a 
downfield passing attack. 
Zach Mettenberger, the Tigers’ 
junior signal caller, has created a shift in LSU’s offense. 
“It just makes us a lot more 
productive and more efficient in 
the passing game,” LSU coach 
Les Miles said of Mettenberger. “There’s no real quarterback run in this offense. Therefore, the abil-
ity to get the ball in other guys’ 
hands down the field just really 
becomes key.”
Mettenberger has provided 
that component so far this season, 
completing 78 of 119 passes for 
1,016 yards and six touchdowns 
with two interceptions. 
His 203.2 passing yards per 
game are more than double the 
100.5 yards per game leading pass-
er Jarrett Lee threw for in 2011. 
With a more accurate, talented 
passer, LSU’s offense has thrown 
on 35.9 percent of offensive snaps this season compared to 32.1 per -
cent last year. 
“[Mettenberger’s] a big-time 
arm talent,” UF coach Will Mus-champ said. “He can make all of the throws. He can zip it and he can put touch on it.”
Said Miles: “When he decides 
to whistle it and throw it on a line, he can step back and let it rip. He’s very accurate and has really good vision.”
All Mettenberger lacks is Divi-
sion-I experience. Saturday’s start 
will be the sixth of his career. 
Mettenberger originally signed 
with Georgia, but he transferred 
to Butler (Kan.) Community Col-
lege after one year. In his only 
season, he threw for 2,678 yards 
and 32 touchdowns with just four interceptions to lead Butler to the 
JUCO National Championship 
Game.He played sparingly for LSU 
last season, completing 8 of 11 passes for 92 yards and a touch-down — all in the second half of a 49-3 rout of Northwestern State on Sept. 10, 2011.
“Mettenberger’s a guy that’s 
got all the arm talent in the world, he just lacks some experience in the [Southeastern Conference],” Muschamp said.
The Tigers are expected to ease 
Mettenberger’s transition to the big stage with their running at-tack, which has racked up 229.6 yards per game so far this season. 
The ground game is expected 
to set up chances for downfield passing — opportunities the Ti-gers were not equipped to take advantage of before Mettenberger took the reins. 
“They are going to max it up 
and take a shot down the field,” Muschamp said. “You need to win those battles.”

With no prior NCAA individual tourna-
ment experience, freshman Danielle Collins 
was an unlikely candidate to advance to the 
main draw of the Riviera/ITA All-Amer -
ican Tournament. But on Wednesday, she 
did just that.
Collins extended her undefeated streak 
to nine matches with a win against No. 79 Kaitlin Ray of UCLA. Even though she lost the first set, she bounced back by winning 12 of the next 13 games (4-6, 6-1, 6-0).
“Danielle had a tough start, drop-ping that first set, but completely turned 
it around,” UF associate head coach  Dave 
Balogh said. “She had to make some adjust-
ments with the style of play and clearly did 
a pretty good job of that.”
After notching three consecutive wins 
in both the pre-qualifying and qualifying rounds, Collins will compete in the tour -
nament’s main draw, which runs today through Sunday. Collins became the first 
Gator to advance to the main draw after 
starting in the pre-qualifying round since Florida began competing in the Riviera in 2001.
“Danielle is fired up,” Balogh said. “Her goal was to have a chance to play in the main 
draw, and now she has that opportunity to 
see how she can compete at the highest level 
of college tennis.”
Collins is a perfect 9-0 
in singles to start the sea-
son. She has outscored 
her opponents 114-54 in games.
She has been forced 
to play a third set only twice. 
Collins joins sixth-ranked All-American 
Lauren Embree, who was guaranteed a spot in the main draw, as the only Gators competing. In addition to their spots in the 
singles draw, the duo will compete as a 
doubles team beginning today at 9 a.m. 
Embree, the No. 3 seed, will face Arizona 
State’s 13th-ranked Jacqueline Cako. Col-lins will face Alabama’s 10th-ranked Mary 
Anne Macfarlane. Both matches are today 
at 3:30 p.m.
Junior Sofie Oyen competed in the third 
round of the qualifying draw but came up 
empty-handed. She lost (6-2, 6-3) against 
Stanford’s Krista Hardebeck, the nation’s top-ranked freshman.
“Sofie had a tough one today,” Balogh 
said, ”but Stanford just played too well.”Freshman advances to main draw of ITA All-American Tournament
