Pedro A. Bravo will face capital murder and kid-
napping charges for his alleged connection in the 
murder and disappearance of a missing UF student.
An Alachua County grand jury indicted Bravo, 
18, on the charges during a meeting late Monday af-
ternoon, according to court records from the Alachua 
County Clerk of Courts.
The 21-person jury also ruled that Bravo would 
continue to be held in Alachua County Jail without bond for both charges, said Spencer Mann, chief in-
vestigator at the State Attorney’s 
Ofﬁ  ce. 
Mann said Bravo and his at-
torneys will be advised of the new 
charges.
“Once that’s done, then we will 
move into the preparation phase 
for trial,” he said. “And we’ll see exactly what position the defense counsel for the defendant will 
take.”
The indictment came about two weeks after Chris-
tian Aguilar went missing.
Police initially named Bravo as a person of inter-
est in the case, and he has been in jail since Sept. 24.
He was charged with ﬁ  rst-degree murder Sept. 
28.
Mann said the prosecution presented the jury with 
evidence Monday to determine whether a crime was committed and to take the case to trial.
“In this particular case, they voted to indict Mr. 
Bravo in murder,” he said.
Mann said the state attorney can obtain a murder 
conviction without a body.
“It takes a few more steps,” he said. “Clearly , the 
burden is on the state to prove the case and that the Suspect in miss-
ing student case indicted with mur-der, kidnapping

Students in Beaty Towers East might 
not want to get too comfortable.
To make room for Innovation Acad-
emy students coming to UF next semes-
ter, students living on ﬂ  oors two through 
nine in the East Tower will be moved to other residence halls across campus, said Carolynn Komanski, assistant director of housing for administrative services. About 180 students will be affected. 
This semester, 46 students living in 
Beaty East have been moved to other dorms, she said, and the remaining stu-dents will be notiﬁ  ed of their new room assignments for Spring between Nov . 26 and Jan. 3.
Students will then have two options: 
They can collect their belongings for the Winter Break period and move into their new assignments Jan. 3, or they can move into their new rooms when they are va-cant and clean before housing closes Dec. 14, according to a UF housing email.
The students affected currently live in 
the overﬂ  ow housing for Fall 2012. They 
weren’t told about the move or about 
Beaty East’s status as overﬂ  ow before they signed up for housing, Komanski said.
Komanski said the students were as-
signed to overﬂ  ow based on the date of their housing applications. 
Courtnie Ulrich, an 18-year-old biolo-
gy freshman, said she would have made another housing choice if she had known she’d have to move.
Ulrich said she was given an option 
to move out early. Her parents, frustrat-ed by the midsemester move, made the two-hour drive to Gainesville last week to help Ulrich relocate.
Komanski said Beaty East’s overﬂ  ow 
housing status is not new, and accommo-dations are made every year for students Beaty East residents forced to relocate

For some UF students, the end of the world is coming 
early this year.Starting today, several hundred UF students will tote 
around Nerf guns and rolled up socks and will carefully 
plan their routes around campus to survive the newest 
round of Humans vs. Zombies.
The game was originally started at Goucher College in 
Baltimore in 2005 and is essentially a ﬁ  ve-day, 24-hours a 
day game of tag, according to the ofﬁ  cial Humans vs. Zom-bies website.
Kevin Freedman, president of Gators Humans vs. Zom-bies, said this will be the tenth time Humans vs. Zombies has been played at UF.
According to Freedman, a 22-year-old mechanical engi-
neering senior, the goal of the game depends on which side a player is on. The zombies must tag humans to turn the humans into zombies.
Zombies win if there are no humans remaining. The 
humans win if they can survive ﬁ  ve days without getting Zombies to invade UF as 10th Humans Vs. Zombies game begins

Student senators certified last 
week’s elections results at Tuesday 
night’s meeting.
The Student Senate had two 
meetings — one with the old sena-
tors and another with the newly 
elected ones.At the first meeting, Sen. Carly 
Wilson raised concerns about the number of votes in District E.
According to election results, 
1,806 people voted in District E. Wil-son referenced last Fall’s elections, which she said 500 votes in District E were considered an anomaly.
“It really scared me because that 
shouldn’t happen,” she said during the meeting.
Supervisor of Elections Stephen 
Davis said according to the codes, the information used for student ad-
dresses is from the university regis-
trar.
Davis said the students might 
not have technically been voting in the wrong district, because about 20,000 students are registered for District E.
Wilson proposed waiting a week 
to certify the results to discuss the 
testing process used by SG Informa-
tion Technology Services.
Sen. Andy Schein disagreed.“Not passing these results right 
now is delaying the whole legisla-tive process,” he said.
During the second meeting, Stu-
dent Body President Tj Villamil said the results were not anybody’s fault 
and that students were clicking and 
not reading the confirmation pages carefully enough. 
Villamil said he is working with 
administration to fix this problem before next Fall’s elections. 
UF Supreme Court Chief Justice 
Matt Michel swore in the new sena-tors. 
The sworn-in senators also elect-
ed Sen. Christina Bonarrigo as the new Senate President and Sen. Dan-iel Landesberg as the new Senate President Pro Tempore.
Bonarrigo said that as president, 
she wants to have constructive debates in chambers and increase transparency and communication. 
“I know it will be the best Senate 
we’ve seen in a long time,” she said after the meeting. 
As Senate Pro Tempore, Landes-
berg will lead the Replacement and Agenda Committee. He said he will be nonpartisan. 
The Senate elects a new president 
and president pro tempore after ev-
ery SG election.
The Senators chose Amit Gan-
grade for the split District D seat. 
That seat was split between Gan-grade and Micaela Montero Dokser, who are both Students Party mem-bers.

Debbie Wasserman 
Schultz took one for the 
team.
“There was a student that 
was registered to vote in my district in South Florida, and we switched their registra-
tion up to Gainesville,” the 
congresswoman said. “But that’s OK, because then we don’t have to worry about an absentee ballot.”
Representative Wasser -
man Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, made an ap-
pearance at UF on Tuesday 
to encourage students to register for the 2012 general election.
The congresswoman was 
welcomed by Gators for Obama members and volun-teers at the Reitz Union Col-onnade.
Christina Ford, co-chair 
for Gators for Obama, said since Wasserman Schultz is a UF political science alumna, students should be encour -
aged to get involved in the 
election.
“I think a lot of us won-
der what can I do with my 
political science degree or how could my involvement 
transition into something,” 
the 20-year-old political sci-ence and economics sopho-more said. “Debbie is the 
perfect example of what we can do.”
Wasserman Schultz 
looked ready for her alma 
mater with a 3-inch bedaz-zled Gator brooch pinned to her royal blue dress.
But politics run through 
her blood just as much as her school colors.
In the 1988 election 
against Ronald Reagan, she spearheaded voter-drives for a familiar name.
“I was involved with 
Students for Joe Biden,” the 
congresswoman said. “Then 
he didn’t win the primary, so I became head of Students for Dukakis.”
Though her efforts in that 
election went unrewarded, that didn’t dampen Wasser -
man Schultz’s enthusiasm for politics, which projects 
whenever she speaks about 
this year’s election.
“Students should vote as 
if their lives depend on it,” 
Wasserman Schultz said. 
“Because it does.”
The congresswoman said 
two main issues affecting 
students are the rising cost 
of higher education and job opportunities for recent graduates.
“The Republicans brought 
us to the brink of student loan interest rates doubling,” Wasserman Schultz said. 
“But Barack Obama hit the 
stump, went out across the country and helped make the Republicans in Congress do the right thing.”

The humans have won twice.
Only UF students and facul-
ty are eligible to be a part of the game, and play is banned indoors 
due to UF policy and safety con-
cerns.
According to Freedman, UF 
football player Jesse Schmitt start-ed Gators Humans vs. Zombies in Spring 2010.
The rules and in-game mis-
sions are always changing, so each game is different.
Freedman said Humans vs. 
Zombies is a great game because the aspects range from creative problem solving to a video game atmosphere.
“It’s got just about everything,” 
Freedman said.
Participants range from brand-
new players to game veterans.
Kris Phifer, 18-year-old UF fine 
arts freshman, said she’s excited to play the game for the first time.
“I get a chance to be a brain-eating zombie,” Phifer said. “I get an excuse to dump buckets of blood on myself. Why wouldn’t I play?”
Sterling Bash, 19-year-old UF 
chemical engineering sophomore, said the game is a good way to learn the layout of campus and 
meet new friends.
“The game’s good to let off 
steam and get away from the se-
riousness college causes,” he said. “It’s also a great excuse to shoot people with Nerf guns.”
Adam Sanchez, 19-year-old 
UF geology sophomore, said he’s playing the game for the fifth time. 
He said it’s one of his favorite ex-
periences at the university.
“Running around late at night 
with your Nerf gun, knowing zombies are hunting you,” he said. “You can’t get that experi-ence with anything else.”
Sanchez said he’s never met 
someone who’s played Humans 
vs. Zombies and hasn’t loved it.
“I’m going to keep playing this 
until I graduate, and even then I 
might not stop,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 10, 2012

Edible Landscaping Club, eats a nasturtium flower on Monday at the Student Agricultural Gardens on Museum Road.

Many people see gardening as a hob-
by. But for Kelly Korman, it’s a way of 
life.
Korman, a second-year women’s stud-
ies graduate student, is president and co-founder of the Eternally Edible Landscap-ing Club, UF’s first student organization 
dedicated to expanding the practice of 
growing produce for personal consump-tion.
Korman, 23, said she got the idea after 
noticing “underutilized” space in the UF 
Student Agricultural Gardens.
“I had seen a lot of initiatives happen-
ing around Gainesville, but not on cam-
pus, and I saw an opportunity,” she said.
Korman and Rodrigo Castro, a build-ing construction Ph.D. student, pitched the concept for the club during the Prairie 
Project for Graduate Fellows workshop 
in May. They received a $1,000 grant from the UF Office of Sustainability to pursue it.
On Sept. 30, the club broke ground 
on its first raised-bed vegetable garden, located by the bat houses on Museum Road. The members have plans to fill in a second garden Saturday, Korman said.
The club has begun growing produce, 
including carrots, radishes and broccoli, she said.
Active members will be able to eat any 
produce grown in the gardens.
Political science junior Evan Clark, 20, 
said the club seems like an interesting op-portunity for students.
“It can’t hurt to know how to feed 
yourself from scratch,” Clark said.
The club will also provide educational 
workshops on edible landscaping, Kor -
man said, and she hopes to develop other 
spaces on campus.
“How cool would it be if you could 
just walk down a sidewalk on campus 
and pick an orange for a healthy snack?” she said.UF club grows edible plantslocAl

Jerome Brown saw the smoke when he 
walked out of his apartment late Tuesday 
night.
A man at the bottom of the stairs shouted 
at the 56-year-old Gainesville resident to call 
for help.
“My house is on fire,’” the man shouted at 
Brown.
Brown ran back into his apartment and called 911.
At about 8:30 p.m., Gainesville Fire Rescue 
responded to the call at an apartment complex 
at the intersection of Southwest Ninth Street and Southwest Depot Avenue. 
The complex is owned by The Arc of Ala-
chua County , which is an organization that provides services to people with mental dis-abilities.
GFR trucks surrounded the building as 
firefighters searched through the bottom floor apartment unit.Residents nearby said they saw smoke 
coming from the building before the trucks ar -
rived.
Ronald Thomas, one of the firefighters who 
went into the apartment, said his team extin-guished several small fires inside the unit’s bedroom and bathroom.
He said one person, the apartment’s owner, 
was burned, though he could not give details about the man’s injuries.
Alachua County Fire Rescue took the man 
to Shands at UF, Thomas said.The fire affected only one apartment, dam-
aging the bathtub and part of the bedroom.
Once the fires were extinguished, fire crews 
used fans to blow carbon monoxide out of the apartment.
Thomas said all the apartment’s residents 
were evacuated.
GFR Fire District Chief James Lovvorn said 
the cause of the fire was still under investiga-tion.

Mann added thatt the next 
court event for Bravo will be 
arraignment, which will “take place in a few weeks.” During 
that time, Bravo will plead guilty , 
not guilty or no contest.
After Bravo presents his plea, 
Mann said the trial will not start any time soon.With the 
prosecution and defense working on 
the case and 
the search for 
Aguilar reach-ing its 20th day, volun-
teers and police are determined to find the missing student.
Carlos Aguilar, Christian 
Aguilar’s father, said he plans to drive back to Miami on Wednes-day for the first time since his son disappeared.
Although the trip home will 
give Carlos Aguilar, 45, time to bring up more supplies and help, he said he will return Friday.
“I’m not happy going back 
right now without my son,” he said.

Students are upset about the move
housed there to move to permanent spaces later in 
the semester as needed.
Typically, she said, vacancies become available 
across campus as students choose not to attend UF or withdraw.
Innovation Academy director Jeff Citty said 334 
Innovation Academy students will move into Beaty East in the Spring.
Innovation Academy is part of a university proj-
ect to help budding entrepreneurs. These students only attend courses on the UF campus in the Spring and Summer and can work, study abroad or do re-search in the Fall.
Citty said housing provided a creative solution 
to offer these students contracts for the Spring and Summer semesters within their own living and learning community.
For students currently living in Beaty East, how-
ever, this creative solution raises some issues.
Joshua Hayes, an 18-year-old aerospace en-
gineering freshman, said he should have been warned about the move before signing up for hous-ing. Uncertain where he will end up next semester, he is trying to cancel his housing contract and live off campus in the Spring.
“The Innovation Academy is not more impor -
tant than me,” Hayes said.beAty , from page 1“It can’t hurt to know how to

for renters to contact them.
The website has yet to rent any houses in 
Gainesville, but some homeowners have list-
ed their residences in hopes for takers. Two 
houses are listed for the South Carolina game.
“It’s a little slow right now,” Doyle said, 
“but we think things will really kick off by 
next season.”
Doyle said the website is an alternative 
way for out-of-towners to find a place to stay , rather than paying for hotels or bunking with 
friends.“We were looking for a big, dedicated 
football fan base with people who are willing to travel to games,” Doyle said. “Gainesville 
seemed to be a good fit.”
The website started seven years ago and 
has expanded to about 15 other locations in-
cluding the University of Notre Dame, which 
has had 350 rentals this season.
The website lists all the homes free of 
charge, only charging percentage-based ser -
vice fee when someone actually rents the resi-dence. Home owners also set their own rental rates.
Doyle said people have charged between 
$750 and $2,000 to stay Friday through Sun-
day. 
Biology senior Catherine Busatto, 21, said 
she thinks the company could be useful in Gainesville.
“My parents have to book a hotel six 
months ahead of time for Homecoming week-
end,” she said. “If there were no hotels, they 
would definitely try that website.”Gameday weekend leasing

Eli Oppenheimer celebrated the 
most recent High Holiday by busting a 
move.
Oppenheimer, a fourth-year UF 
dental student, was among UF students 
who danced until 2 a.m. Tuesday at 
Lubavitch-Chabad Jewish Student and Community Center to celebrate Sim-chat Torah, the end of the High Holy Days period.
“This place was, as they say in 
America, rocking,” said Berl Goldman, rabbi and director of the center. “Rock-ing with spiritual joy.”
About 250 people came in and out 
Monday evening for prayer and danc-ing with the Torah. They met again Tuesday afternoon to dance.
Service was in the traditional syna-
gogue setting, which separates male and female seating. Men and women also danced separately.
Lubavitch-Chabad Jewish Student 
and Community Center, 2021 NW Fifth Ave., hosted services and dances throughout the holiday from Sunday to Tuesday. It celebrated Shmini Atzeret, the day of rest between two bigger holi-days, and Simchat Torah, the comple-tion of public Torah readings.
Funding events for the entire High 
Holy Days period, starting with Rosh Hashanah, cost the center about $60,000, Goldman said. 
Oppenheimer, 26, was the first stu-
dent to show up for Tuesday’s daytime dance.
“Every year I’ve been here, it’s very 
festive,” he said. “Everyone’s always involved.”
The Gainesville center opened 13 
years ago and celebrates the holiday ev-ery year. Construction is underway for a new center, which Goldman said will be finished by summer or fall of 2013.
“Every company has their motto or 
tagline. Ours is ‘It’s a home away from home for the students,’” Goldman said. “It’s great to be a Jewish Gator.”Jewish Gators jive for holiday

Finding a balance between late-night food 
options and library policy became a concern 
when Library West renewed its extended hours for UF students this Fall.
According to the library’s food policy sign, 
only snacks, Starbucks and covered drinks are allowed. Hot food, frozen yogurt, ice cream or anything requiring two hands or utensils to eat, however, are not OK to have inside.
Library West chairman Patrick Reakes said 
there are two primary reasons for the food pol-icy: the smell of hot foods and the mess.
“The biggest complaint that I get from 
people is not being able to keep the building clean,” he said.
The library staff is trying to hear and un-
derstand students’ needs to find a happy me-dium.
Food incidents happen almost every day, 
Reakes said. Keyboards, floors and tables be-come greasy. Pizza boxes have been left in study rooms. Bugs are another concern.
Students can bring their own food to eat in 
the cafe area on the bottom floor, he said, but once they go on the escalator, no food other than snacks and drinks are allowed.
Alexis Charnas, a 22-year-old history senior, 
said she understands the food policy.
“If I know for sure that I’m going to study 
late, I’ll try to bring something from my dorm, 
whether it’s an apple or a bag of chips,” Char -
nas said.
Economics sophomore Alexandra Mazur, 
19, said she thinks food would help her to stay 
focused while studying. Small meals and hot 
foods are better than snacks to have later at 
night, she said.
Students should eat when they are hungry, 
not when they are stressed or bored, according 
to an email from Janis Mena, a nutritionist at 
UF’s Student Health Care Center.
An example of a discreet, neat snack would 
be a mixture of whole grain cereal, nuts and 
dried fruit. It can survive in the backpack until 
needed and can be washed down with water, 
she said, adding that slight dehydration may 
cause fatigue.Food policies change for  libraries

Efﬁ  ng Florida
Of course the weird 
stuff happens here
There’s an elephant in the room.
In fact, it’s in the whole state.
Actually, the elephant is the state.
It’s time to talk about Florida.
Welcome to Florida, where apparently it’s perfectly ﬁ  ne 
to be insane.
Remember Lisa Nowak, the female astronaut who went 
nuts and drove across the country wearing a diaper to kid-
nap her ex-boyfriend? That happened in Florida.
According to TIME’s article titled “Houston, She’s Got 
Some Problems,” she was charged “with attempted mur-
der after driving 900 miles from Houston to Orlando, Fla., 
allegedly carrying a knife, a BB gun, pepper spray, latex 
gloves and rubber tubing — wearing a diaper all the while 
so she wouldn’t have to stop en route — and assaulting a 
romantic rival in a parking lot.”
It seems that there’s always something weird going on 
in our state.
In fact, the Sun-Sentinel has a whole vertical of its web-
site dedicated to “weird, wacky, strange, news from the 
Sunshine State” called “FloriDUH.”
We’re just trying to brace you for what happened here 
in the past week.
Edward Archbold died from ingesting too many in-
sects.
He stuffed himself with “handfuls of crickets, worms 
and cockroaches,” according to an Associated Press story. Why? To win a python, of course.
There’s no way we’re going into the gross details of this 
story, thats headline is “Man’s roach-eating death raises 
question: Why?”
Archbold may have “hit his tolerance level to cockroach 
allergens” and went into anaphylactic shock, said Mike Tringale, the vice president of The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America in the AP story.
The story references Sarah Bernard, an entomology stu-
dent at UF, who attended the contest at the Ben Siegel Rep-tiles store in Deerﬁ  eld Beach. She shot video of the contest on her cellphone.
“I was focusing on him because I was closest to him and 
he was really entertaining,” she said in the story. “I saw that he had a clear strategy. He would push everything into 
his mouth and try to swallow it with water. He ﬁ  gured out 
what worked and he did it.”
Just. Um. Ew. Really, Florida?Let’s try to get a better reputation than one of totally tu-
bular party college campuses or severely weird and gross stories like Archbold’s.
Is this a cautionary tale? Probably. Don’t eat strange 
insects in copious amounts. Try eating them in normal amounts ﬁ  rst, because who knows how it will affect your 
body.
Try not to act crazy. Florida’s already got it covered.Big Bird should not be an issue in election
In light of the ﬁ  rst presidential debate’s aftermath, 
what appears to be a national controversy quickly emerged. What led to mass discontent is none other 
than Big Bird.
The lovable ﬁ  gure from the children’s program “Ses-
ame Street” entered the political fray amid presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s statements “I’m going to stop 
the subsidy to PBS,” and “I like PBS. I love Big Bird ... 
I’m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for it.”
While both major parties argue over these claims, 
this debate about “Big Bird,” and PBS in general, should 
be a nonissue. 
Instead, the famous children’s character serves as a 
rallying cry for both parties.
“You can debate whether or not there should be fund-
ing of public broadcasting. But when they always try to 
tout out Big Bird, and say we’re going to kill Big Bird — that is actually misleading, because ‘Sesame Street’ will be here,” a “Sesame Street” executive said. 
In fact, the federal government funds 15 percent of 
the PBS annual budget. Cuts to PBS as a whole would be rather minimal. 
While funds for the station would deplete, it would 
still exist. However, we can assume that PBS would 
strive to increase its fundraising efforts.
While a cut to PBS would not halt the development 
of “Sesame Street,” it would not signiﬁ  cantly affect the 
federal deﬁ  cit, as it accounts for only 0.01 percent of the budget. Because cuts to a nonessential program like PBS 
don’t have a signiﬁ  cant impact one way or the other, the 
only substance to this issue is that Big Bird can serve as an effective political tool for ﬁ  gures of both campaigns.
Republicans, in favor of limited spending, view Big 
Bird as an image for the necessity of severe budget cuts. 
Democrats, in opposition of cuts to essential pro-gramming, use Big Bird as a symbol to combat these claims.
The use of Big Bird as a sym-
bol for any respective message is effective. 
People, young and old, 
are quick to identify with Big 
Bird. His image is nationally 
renowned because many of us 
have grown up with him by watching “Sesame Street” as children.
Now, we see Big Bird everywhere — on Facebook 
and at campaign rallies. 
In my opinion, this lovable character has shifted into 
a symbol of political gridlock. 
Instead of focusing on the real issues, we have used 
him during the past week to maintain negative cam-paigning by pointing ﬁ  ngers.
This is an ideological issue rather than a policy issue. 
While Romney uses PBS and Big Bird as an example of cutting nonessential programs, others discuss it as if it 
is a major crisis. This is an effective use of rhetoric by 
Romney. 
By using the phrase “Big Bird” instead of saying PBS, 
he can make an argument that almost the majority of 
the electorate, regardless of party afﬁ  liation, can iden-
tify with. 
President Obama has used him, just as effectively, to 
criticize Romney, albeit in a humorous manner.
Big Bird allows both candidates to better connect to 
the American people. 
Unfortunately, it seems as if both candidates empha-
size the character’s presence for rhetoric and negative campaigning to undermine the opposition rather than 
make a case of speciﬁ  c policy.

Letter to the Editor
One of the points in Monday’s 
editorial really bothered me. 
The sentence “What if Obama 
let Romney set himself up for a 
future failure by lulling him into a false sense of security?” both-ered me. 
Uh — really? Come on, liberals. I know you 
all are sore losers (How many times did Al Gore ask for a bal-lot recount in Florida in the 2000 election?), but even you cannot be that hardheaded. 
Romney kicked Obama’s a-- 
so badly that even the most lib-eral hosts on MSNBC admitted Romney won and could not ﬁ  nd 
a way to defend Obama’s perfor-
mance. (I’m looking at you, Chris Matthews.)
But, for argument’s sake, lets say Obama and his campaign team’s strategy was to throw the debate. 
If it was, Obama should ﬁ  re 
his campaign manager. No one throws a debate this close to the election unless he or she wants to 
lose. 
And if Obama is so wonderful, 
why did he need to throw a de-
bate to surprise attack Romney in the next one?
I have a better question: What 
if Obama lost the debate because 
his points didn’t stand up to scru-
tiny? Or because he cannot defend the last three and a half years of his presidency as we’re still stuck 
in this “Bush-era” economy?
I agree with the end of the col-
umn, though. 
Joe Biden is a light in the dis-tance — one of great comedic re-
lief.  
His ridiculous remarks 
(“They’re going to put y’all back in chains” is my favorite.) make great television. Plus, I cannot wait to see the excuses people will 
come up with when he loses.

This Monday, the Romney camp, led by vice presi-
dential candidate Rep. Paul Ryan, had a chat with Southern Michigan’s most exuberant loyalists.
Along with a hefty slate of Michigan’s Republican can-
didates and incumbents, Ryan remarked at Oakland Uni-
versity’s Athletics Center O’rena in Rochester, Mich. The 
Thunderstix clapped, “U.S.A.” chants rang out through the cavernous hall and the mere mention of Obama or Biden drew a chorus of lusty “boos.”
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, with the general election 
reaching its homestretch, there I was, right in the belly of the beast.
Surely though, this chaos was nothing that a “proud 
hunter” like Paul Ryan couldn’t tame. Indeed, for all the 
hype surrounding his natural charisma and silver tongue, 
I was half-expecting to be swept up in a whirlwind of Ryan-ism myself.
If there’s one thing that’s difﬁ  cult for me to take down 
with a straight face, it’s political rhetoric. Whether the cat-tiness, the baseless accusations, the half-truths and the un-abashed contradictions were  from the right or the left, I’m prone to dismiss most of the vitriol as static.
However, would Ryan, with his reported irresistible 
charm, stand alone as a model of integrity among it all? Could he break through my icy layer of skepticism?
In a word: No. By the time 
Ryan got on stage, my old habits had already crept safely back in. Whether it was inﬂ  ammatory, garbled or just plain uncomfortable, each Republican hopeful who ﬁ  led onto the stage pushed me closer to the edge of outright 
political apathy . Kerry Bentivolio, a House hopeful for 
Michigan’s 11th district, stammered through vague ideas of hope and American values. U.S. Rep. Candice Miller managed to blame high gas prices on “an absence of lead-ership in the White House.”
Of course, the common thread throughout all of this 
rambling stemmed from the faults of one man: President Barack Obama. Pastor Kent Clark lamented how the Lord had been “banned from America” by the current admin-
istration. Pete Hoekstra, Sen. Debbie Stabenow’s Repub-
lican challenger, criticized the strength of our national security.
Ben Bishop, the tween son of Oakland County’s Mike 
Bishop, was given a minute to talk about how his gen-eration wouldn’t have the ability to pay off the debts that Obama’s spending would incur.
Thank you, Mike, for sacriﬁ  cing your son to complete 
this three-ring circus of a rally.
Ugh.I realize that the Republican campaign has never been 
about winning votes through fair play and ethics, but when Ryan and his cronies are coming out with a holier-than-thou attitude about the dirtiness of the political pro-cess, how can you not feel like your intelligence has been insulted a little bit?
It’s disheartening, to say the least, that by the end of 
the night, the only speaker who had said anything with 
even an ounce of goodwill toward the opposition was 
none other than Michigan’s Kid Rock.
“I really believe strongly that it’s OK to disagree on 
politics and the direction of our country without hating one another,” he said. That may be true, Kid, but be sure to let your friends know it, too.

circus of rhetoric Uwire
I’m just going to level with you up front: I cry easily.  You 
might label me a punk for admitting that, and I won’t 
dispute those claims, but I can’t control the atmospheric 
conditions that aggravate my sensitive tear ducts.
Judgers.I have to be careful with my “gift,” though.  A while back, 
my roommate got the brilliant idea that we should watch 
“John Q” for movie night.  
I refused.The last thing I need is to feel like I’m the one who needs 
a new heart after the emotional agony from watching that 
movie again.  Knowing the outcome doesn’t dam the ﬂ  ow.
I’d like to think it serves a greater purpose.  For starters, 
my girlfriend seems to think that it’s manly. Although I’m not inclined to convince her otherwise, I believe something deeper lurks in the waterworks.
A few months ago, I was with a friend at a local restau-
rant when she conﬁ  ded that life was rough.  Family relations were terrible, and she felt alienated from her father.  
She wept as we spoke. Sometimes I’m embarrassed to 
cry in front of people, but that wasn’t the case this day. She 
looked up periodically from her exposition and saw that I 
was crying, too.  She smiled.  
She knew I got it.  
I had this unshakable intuition that she’d be OK, but I felt 
her pain in that moment.  
Let’s allow this to marinate for a second.
If you’ve read my previous columns, it won’t come as a 
shock that I am a fan of questions. However, none of them seems to stump people quite like the theodicy.
Why do bad things happen to good people?  Why is there 
so much pain, evil and suffering, especially if you believe in 
a god that is good?
I’ll be honest; I don’t have an answer or, at least, not one 
that ﬁ  ts neatly inside a column.
Perhaps none of us is as “good” as we think we are.  I know that offends most of us, and I’m not trying to be a troll.  
I’ve realized that I have this pe-
culiar way of purposefully exclud-ing God when I want to do my own thing, only to attack him later 
with silly questions like “Where were you?”  
In hindsight, that one’s not so 
hard to answer.
Perhaps he puriﬁ  es us in hardship, like gold through 
ﬁ  re.  
Perhaps pain is God’s megaphone to a phenomenally 
deaf world, as C.S. Lewis so eloquently stated.  
Perhaps he doesn’t owe us anything.  Perhaps he never promised us perfection in this life.I ﬁ  nd myself asking different questions these days, name-
ly because I am smitten by Jesus’ life.
Why does the one who least deserved to suffer agree to 
suffer the most of anyone in history? What do you do with 
a god who incarnates himself in human ﬂ  esh and bears the 
entire weight of our evil and pain?
I’m not diminishing our plight, but I feel as though we’re 
prone to asking the wrong questions. Maybe God knows suf-
fering better than we can imagine, and perhaps we need the wake-up call sometimes.
God never promises that we won’t suffer.  In fact, he goes out of his way to state that hardship will 
come, especially to those who choose to follow him.  His pres-ence heals us now. His perfection lies in the world to come.
Still, I’m reminded of the story of Jesus meeting a grieving 
family before he raises its brother back to life. His response 
to their anguish is probably the most perplexing part of the 
proceedings.
Jesus wept.It’s an odd move for one who knows how the story ends.

� THE COTTAGE FOOD LAW 
WENT INTO EFFECT LAST YEAR.
JENNA HOSTETLER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Sherrie Blackwelder looked 
down at her daughter, Isabella.
“What’s your favorite thing to do 
with mommy?” she asked.
“Play Candy Land!” responded 
4-year-old Isabella.
Blackwelder’s 2-year-old son, Ira, 
ran around the room, gleefully gig-
gling as his older sister chased him.
“Those are the moments you 
don’t want to miss,” she said and smiled.
But up to July , those were the 
memories 27-year-old Blackwelder missed while she managed her new business, Cake Classics. Busy try-
ing to manage orders, Blackwelder 
didn’t have much time to spend at home.
She brought her kids to work 
sometimes, but most of the time 
they stayed at home with a babysit-
ter, who always knew what the kids needed.
Because she wanted to spend 
more time with her children, Black-welder decided to move Cake Clas-sics into her home in July , a year after the Cottage Food Law passed 
in Florida. Now her hours center on 
her children’s naptimes and bed-times.
“Kids need consistency,” Black-
welder explained, “and I didn’t have that with the bakery.”
The Cottage Food Law went into 
effect in Florida in July 2011 and al-lows individuals to manufacture, 
sell and store products from an un-
licensed home kitchen. The Florida Department of Agriculture over -
sees and enforces the law, and it 
gives people the option to sell items 
like lollipops and bread from their homes but bans other items like dried meats.
Blackwelder doesn’t have to get 
an extra license to sell cakes from her kitchen as long as she doesn’t make more than $15,000 a year from the endeavor.
Blackwelder’s cakes start at $5 
a serving, and her vegan creations start at $6 a serving. According to Cake Classics’ website, Blackwelder is the only baker in North Florida 
who focuses on organic and vegan 
cakes.
She said the law is a win-win for 
her. She gets to keep her cake-mak-
ing hobby and doesn’t have to pay a babysitter.
These days, the Blackwelder 
home is filled with Spanish and 
swimming lessons with mommy , 
potty training for Ira and, of course, 
lots of cake.
Baking happens during naptime, 
and Blackwelder said she decorates 
the cakes once she gets the kids to 
sleep at about 8:30 p.m.
Making a cake, especially a four-
tiered cake, isn’t a one-day process, she said. A single cake can take 
about 10 hours.
“People think it’s supposed to go 
by so fast,” Blackwelder said, speak-
ing slower and slower to exaggerate 
her point. “This is not McDonald’s.”
Blackwelder’s journey to the bak-
ery business began in 2006 when her 
friend was planning a wedding on a tight budget. Blackwelder, using the 
baking sense she had from her aunts 
and grandma, offered to make her friend’s wedding cake — a monster of a project with white chocolate ga-
nache.“It’s actually a pretty difficult 
cake,” she said and laughed.
During the following three years, 
Blackwelder made six more wed-ding cakes for family members and 
friends.
Then she had her own wedding 
— though she didn’t make the cake 
— and graduated from UF with a 
wildlife ecology degree. She intend-ed to attend veterinary school, but she and her husband had to make a choice: vet school or children.
She chose children.It wasn’t until 2010 that she 
showed up at Cake Classics asking to be trained to be a cake maker. Four months later, she took over the 
business alongside her sister-in-law.
But being a working mom was 
more demanding than she had an-ticipated.
When the Cottage Food Law 
passed, she jumped at the opportu-
nity to move her business into her 
home.
When the kids aren’t sleeping, 
she lets them play at their own tiny 
table while she works. She gives 
them leftover fondant and dull dec-
orating tools and lets them pretend they’re professional chefs.
While she said it can be over -
whelming, especially when she 
stays up past 2 a.m., she’s thankful 
she doesn’t need to go anywhere else.
“Even though this is still a lot 
of work,” she said, “at least I’m at home.”  
Blackwelder said her husband 
stays up with her when she has work to do.
Ethan, a software developer, likes 
that his wife can work at home now, especially for his kids.
“They like it,” he said. “They got 
their momma all day now.”8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 10, 2012

Ben Payne picked up his trumpet case, 
threw his polyester uniform over his shoul-
der and prepared to make the long, hot trek to campus from his apartment Saturday morn-ing.
The 19-year-old exploratory sophomore is 
a member of the Gator marching band, and on gamedays, he doesn’t have a car to get to the stadium.
“The bus system on gameday is a joke,” 
said Payne. “The buses virtually don’t run at all, at least not when I’m trying to get any-where.”Other issues like this — dubbed “first-
world problems” — were recently polled about in New Zealand.
According to the country’s UNICEF 
branch, the No. 1 gripe was slow Internet, fol-lowed by not being able to find something at 
the supermarket.
At UF, there are many small, sometimes 
trivial, nuisances that can make students’ lives 
more difficult.
Some students aren’t satisfied with the 
free Internet service provided to them by the school.
Jennifer Serviss, 18, said her cellphone gets 
sporadic service from UF’s Wi-Fi.
“Every once in a while, it’ll kick me off the Wi-Fi but won’t notify me,” said the marine sciences freshman. “Over summer, I ended up using up all of my data without realizing it.”
Among Internet and cellphone reception 
grievances, students grumble about getting coffee in the morning.
“Getting a simple espresso before class at 
the Hub or Library West is crazy ,” said Sherin Merchant, 20-year-old biology junior.
Before lab, Merchant stops by Starbucks to grab her regular pick-me-up, but instead, she’s greeted with a long line.
“It takes 15 minutes to get my drink,” she 
said. “That’s on a good day.”
Though these frustrations take up time and 
patience, Gregory Webster, assistant professor of psychology, said students should remem-ber to put these complaints into perspective.
“People use that expression now — ‘first-
world problems’ — to remind us how fortu-nate and lucky we are,” Webster said. “These day-to-day problems are quite trivial com-pared to other societies.”
He said he’s happy to see the phrase circu-
late among students, because they realize the difference between necessities and luxuries.
“Here, we have the luxury to wait three ex-
tra minutes for coffee,” Webster said.#firstworldproblems: Study finds biggest gripes of the privileged“People think it’s sup-

after her Marriage and Family class at Sante Fe College on Tuesday afternoon.

When Whitney Jeter left her car in 
West Palm Beach last year, she didn’t  
know she’d help Gainesville break a 
record.
The 19-year-old Santa Fe College 
health science sophomore is among 
millions of people who have ridden Regional Transit System buses in the past year. On Monday, the city an-
nounced it had broken its previous 
annual record of about 10 million by about 700,000 riders.
Chip Skinner, RTS spokesman, said 
more people are riding the bus now 
because of the economy. He said it’s 
simply more expensive to own a car.
He also attributed the success to a new program at Santa Fe College that allows students to ride for free.
Jeter said she loves that the rides 
are free now.
“Even if I did have a car, I’d still 
take the bus,” She said. “It’s more convenient, because parking is such a hassle.”
Skinner said public transit nation-
wide has become people’s main choice for transportation.
He mentioned a study done by the 
American Public Transportation As-

People might expect trees on UF’s campus 
to turn orange this fall. What they may not ex-
pect is some trees turning blue.
While most trees seldom get a second 
glance in the whirlwind of activity around 
campus, starting Monday, they’ll become 
works of art after a vibrant makeover.
The trees will be temporarily painted blue 
as part of “The Blue Trees,” a social art action started by Australian artist Konstantin Dimo-poulos.
Dimopoulos paints the trees a color not 
usually found in nature to trigger the imagina-tion and emphasize how little trees are noticed in day-to-day life, even though they make hu-man life possible, he wrote in an email.
“I am not against forestry ,” he said, “but 
unsustained and unmanaged ecocide of old growth forests will turn the planet into a des-
ert.”
“The Blue Trees” is coming to Gainesville 
for Arts and Humanities Month and to honor 
the 150th anniversary of the Morrill Act, which created land-grant universities like UF. A kick-off ceremony for the exhibit will be at noon Oct. 17 near the Reitz Union Colonnade, said Anna Heineman, administrator for the UF Art in State Buildings Program.
The blue colorant is water-based and envi-
ronmentally safe, Heineman said. Depending on the weather, it should wash away with rain in six to nine months.
Dimopoulos has painted trees in New Zea-
land, Canada, Australia and the Northwestern United States. His future plans include New York City and Austria.
Heineman said the College of Fine Arts 
worked with the Horticultural Sciences De-partment to promote the exhibit and identify which trees met the artist’s requirements of being less than 40 feet tall and having smooth bark. 
Dimopoulos plans to paint during the 
course of a week with the help of volunteers, Heineman said. The trees will be painted in 
clusters around campus.
Signs with QR codes will be placed near 
trees so passersby with smartphones can scan the codes to read information about each spe-
cies, Heineman said.
In Westlake Park, a hardscape park in 
downtown Seattle that is the most recent site of the exhibit, the honey locust trees are still a “very bright blue” despite having been com-pleted about six months ago, said Dewey Pot-
ter, communications manager for the Seattle 
Parks and Recreation Department.
“People were everything from mystified 
to delighted to somewhat angry,” Potter said. “Most people, when we explained what the colorant was made of, were satisfied.”
Some Seattle residents worried the colorant 
may harm the trees or the environment, but overall, the response to the exhibit has been 
positive, she said.
“Personally, I love them,” Potter said. 
“People don’t notice the trees around them. If 
it gets people talking, it’s done its job.” Artist to paint trees blue temporarily to show their importance
� ABOUT A THIRD OF 
ADULTS UNDER 30 ARE NOT RELIGIOUS.
MICHELLE PLITNIKAS
Alligator Contributing Writer
One in five Americans is 
not affiliated with a religion, 
according to a Pew Research Center study released Tues-day. And though many UF 
students worship regularly 
at Gainesville religious cen-ters, college has a reputation as a prime time for twenty-somethings to question their beliefs.
About a third of adults un-
der 30 reported no religious 
affiliation compared with 9 
percent of those 65 and older, according to the study.
Some students’ acceptance 
or rejection of religion can be attributed to their individual understandings, said Robert L. Hatch, a UF professor and director of medical education.
“When you leave home, 
even if you were religious in that environment, you’re giv-en a chance to figure it out on your own,” he said.
Students often break com-
munity bonds and gain auton-omy when they go to college, Hatch said. Even if they are 
drawn to a religion, they may 
not feel obligated to attend services.
Spiritual people, Hatch 
said, may think about religious affiliation or the presence of a higher power but may not act on it. Those who are religious 
will go to a place of worship 
and practice their religion.
“Students will say, ‘I know 
that I believe in a higher pow-er, but I don’t know that I want to go to church,’” he said.
Lisa Lee, a 20-year-old ex-
ploratory sophomore who de-scribes herself as “very athe-ist,” said her beliefs changed when she moved to college.
“I used to be Christian, but 
I’m not anymore,” she said. “I went to church, I even prayed, but I never really believed it. There were just so many il-logical things.”
But Jessica Orenstein, a 
20-year-old sociology junior, hasn’t changed her views since 
coming to UF. She stopped 
practicing Judaism when she was 12.
At UF Hillel, leaders still 
see plenty of student involve-ment — their weekly Shabbat usually draws about 150 stu-dents.
The Pew statistics don’t 
surprise Melissa Stern, a 22-year-old engagement asso -
ciate with UF Hillel.
“It’s the first time for stu-
dents to live on their own and make their own calls with re-ligion or other pursuits,” she said.

Gainesville residents will have the 
rare opportunity to see and hear five 
lauded authors read their own works during a three-day event that starts on Thursday evening.
The Florida Writers Festival will 
start at the Alachua County Library District Headquarters at 7:30 p.m.
The 63rd annual festival includes 
four free separate events and will feature the following authors: Lau-ren Groff, Mary Gaitskill, Ben Lerner, Karen Solie and Kevin Wilson, said Rebecca Evanhoe, 29, head festival or -
ganizer and assistant to the director for the MFA in creative writing program.
“The writers we’ve picked have 
very distinct writing styles,” said Evan-hoe, also a third-year graduate student in the fiction writing track of the MFA in creative writing program.
Individuals will listen to the au-
thors speak and have a Q&A session with them during Craft Talks on Sat-
urday afternoon.
She said that to choose the authors, 
graduate students within the program 
each selected their favorite authors and then voted on the top 10.
The Friday and Saturday events 
will be held on campus at the Ustler Hall Atrium.
Heather Peterson, a second-year 
graduate student in the fiction track of the MFA in creative writing program, considers the authors almost heroes.
“It’s like going to a concert and see-
ing your favorite band play their mu-sic live,” Peterson, 27, said.Florida Writers Festival 
welcomes five writersHe’s painted trees in New Zealand and Canada “Even if I did have a car, I’d 
still take the bus.”

Former Gator Suspended By NFL

  Coach Billy Donovan’s oldest 
son is coming home. 
  Florida announced Tuesday 
that his son, also named Billy 
Donovan, will join the team as a walk-on junior guard after trans-ferring from Division-III Catholic University in Washington, D.C.
  Under NCAA transfer rules, 
Donovan cannot play in 2012-13 but can practice with the Gators. He will be eligible to play during the 2013-14 season.  
  “I’m looking forward to con-
tributing any way I can,” the younger Donovan said in a UF re-lease. “I’m excited to be a part of this team and to ﬁ  ll any role that 
helps make us better.”
  In two seasons with the Cardi-
nals, the 6-foot-2, 203-pound Don-
ovan started 19 games. 
He averaged four points and 
1.7 rebounds in 46 contests.  
  Last year, he showcased his 
scoring ability beyond the arc, shooting 34 percent on 3-pointers. 
He played 18.4 minutes per 
game, averaged 5.9 points and ﬁ  nished third on the team with 49 
assists.
  Donovan   
scored more than 1,000 career 
points as a four-year starter and 
ﬁ  rst-team All-
Conference per-former at St. Fran-
cis Catholic High in Gainesville.
  Initially, he did not see himself 
playing for his father or staying close to home for college.
  “I kind of wanted to get out of 
Gainesville a little bit,” Donovan 
said in November. “Just go to a 
Catholic school and play basket-ball. … It really worked out well, and I don’t regret the decision I made at all.”
  Said coach Donovan: “He had 
absolutely zero interest in play-ing for me — did not want to do that. I’ve never really pushed him 
toward basketball. Never really 
pushed him toward Catholic Uni-versity. He did this all on his own. It’s what he wanted to do.”

  For the better part of the 
2011 season, Jaylen Wat-
kins wasn’t the best football 
player in his family.
  Sammy Watkins, his 
half-brother, earned All-
America honors as a fresh-
man wide receiver for 
Clemson. 
Jaylen, a junior corner-
back for Florida, ﬁ  nished last season without record-
ing an interception.
  A two-game suspension 
and a shoulder sprain have 
sidelined Sammy for three 
games, leaving the family 
spotlight on Jaylen, who has been more successful on the ﬁ  eld in 2012. 
  Jaylen leads the Gators 
with two interceptions, in-cluding a second-quarter pick against LSU quarter-back Zach Mettenberger on 
Saturday.
  The brothers exchange 
text messages before and 
after games to motivate each other.
  “[Sammy] knew from 
working out with me that I was capable of doing all that,” Jaylen said of his 
performance so far in 2012. 
“He’s just ready to see it happen even more.”
  With experience comes 
intelligence for Jaylen. 
  The junior from Cape 
Coral increased his work-load in the meeting room from previous seasons, 
which has put him in better 
positions to generate turn-overs.
  In Florida’s win against 
Kentucky, Watkins slid 
under the in-tend-ed re-
ceiver to pick off a Morgan Newton pass for his ﬁ  rst career interception.
  Watkins said he 
wouldn’t have made that play last season.
  “I didn’t have the knowl-
edge of the game,” Watkins said. 
“Watching ﬁ  lm and be-
ing a self-evaluator and saying I could have did this better. I think all of us have 
done that this year, so that’s 
why everybody is making plays.”Junior learning from 
experience, family 
END OF GREGULATION
  Calling 20 power runs in a game 
seems like an easy and monoto-nous task. 
  Quarterback takes snap, guard pulls, 
quarterback hands to running back, suc-cess. Simple. 
  But not the way UF offensive coordina-
tor Brent Pease does it. 
Even when Pease calls a run-heavy 
offense, as he did when he dialed up 25 consecutive running plays to close out Florida’s upset of LSU, his play-calling is 
practically a work of art. 
  The number of different formations, 
motions, sweep actions and personnel 
groupings Pease employs are enough to 
make defensive coordinators’ heads spin, 
even if UF is essentially running the same play nearly 30 times per game. 
  So while it’s easy 
to credit Gillislee and the offensive line for gaining 176 yards on the ground against 
the Tigers, don’t for-
get about the man 
upstairs moving all the chess pieces. 
  On Tuesday, Pease said ﬂ  exibility and 
creativity in the run game have been key 
to UF’s success.
He wasn’t kidding.
  Even neglecting pre-snap motion, UF 
ran the ball in more than a dozen different 
personnel groupings. 
From Driskel’s quarterback blast in a ﬁ  ve-wide set, to Driskel’s keeper on a 
rollout with one back and four tight ends. The Gators also ran 16 plays with multiple 
players lined up in both back and tight end 
positions. 
  The task of trying to defend the ground 
game gets even more difﬁ  cult when Flori-
da starts lining up tackles in the tight-end 
spots. 
By my unofﬁ  cial count, reserve linemen 
D.J. Humphries and Ian Silberman were both on the ﬁ  eld for 10 plays. Humphries 
was in without Silberman for another 
three. 
  Humphries, Silberman and the ﬁ  ve 
starters on the offensive line weigh a com-
bined 2,146 pounds. 
Pease said the choice to play that group comes down to the theory that “mass kicks 
ass,” but it isn’t that simple. 
The Gators’ offensive coordinator 
makes those players more effective by put-ting that mass in motion. Florida pulled a guard on 24 of its 53 rushing attempts — counting sacks as pass attempts — against 
LSU. The Gators put both a guard and 
tackle in motion on another four, includ-ing Gillislee’s 12-yard touchdown run in the third quarter that gave Florida a 7-6 lead. 
  That call in particular was a thing of 
beauty. 
In the ﬁ  rst quarter, the Gators lined up 
with two backs about 4 yards behind the 
line of scrimmage and offset to Driskel’s Offensive coordinator deserves credit for UF’s ground game  Donovan

Quotable
“We’re in the ﬁ  fth game of the year. Next question.” 
Will Muschamp 
UF coach
On Mike Gillislee’s Heisman chances
left. 
At the snap, left tackle Xavier Nixon 
and left guard James Wilson pulled to 
block right. 
Solomon Patton sprinted across the for -
mation from his position on the right flank 
to snatch a handoff from Driskel and run 
left on the sweep. 
The play went for a loss of 2 yards. That 
alignment wasn’t seen again until Gil-
lislee’s touchdown run. 
Everything happened the same as it did 
in the first quarter, and the defense again reacted to Patton’s sweep action. 
Only this time Driskel handed to Gil-
lislee, who followed Nixon and Wilson 
through a gaping hole and into the end 
zone untouched. 
For as much of a smash-mouth style as 
Florida’s is, Pease compliments it with this type of deception. 
Instead of lining Patton up at wide re-
ceiver and running a traditional jet sweep, Pease twice lined Patton up at tight end to hide the reverse action from LSU’s de-
fense. 
Pease’s background makes his success 
orchestrating Florida’s running game even 
more impressive. 
Counting sacks as pass attempts instead 
of rush attempts, the Gators have run the 
ball on 65.8 percent of plays this season. 
With Boise State in 2011, Pease’s attack was astonishingly balanced: 485 pass attempts, 484 rush attempts. 
Pease said he knew when he was hired 
at Florida that coach Will Muschamp want-ed a run-heavy attack, and obviously Mus-champ figured Pease would be up to the task. 
Still, Pease’s ability to direct successful 
offenses under vastly different philoso-phies says a great deal about his talent as 
a play caller, even if Gillislee and the of-
fensive linemen are the ones doing all the heavy lifting.

 The ﬁ  rst defensive 
player to crack 
our poll in 2012, Clowney has been a terror off the edge for the Game-cocks’ opponents. Although double- and triple-teams 
have kept him from posting gaudy statistics, the impact of Rivals’ top-ranked player in the 2011 high school class cannot be denied. Clowney had four tackles and a sack in South Carolina’s 35-7 win against Georgia.  5. �� Marqise Lee, USC wide

caught 10 or more passes in four of his ﬁ  ve games this season. Despite playing on the team that ranks 61st in the NCAA in pass attempts, Lee ranks second nationally with 10.4 receptions per game. 1. �� Geno Smith, West Virginia

Although he was 
facing a ranked opponent in his ﬁ  rst Big 12 road game, Smith had no issues maintaining his status as the Heisman frontrun-
ner. He completed 25 of 35 passes for 268 yards and four touchdowns in West Virginia’s 48-45 win at Texas. Smith leads the NCAA in passing yards per game, completion percentage and touchdown passes.

greg , from page 13Walk-on transfer joins talented UF backcourt
Father and son squared off in an exhibition game in the 
O’Connell Center on Nov. 3. 
In the Gators’ 114-57 victory, Donovan scored a team-high 
13 points on 3-of-7 shooting in 27 minutes. He also grabbed 
four rebounds and had three assists. 
Donovan is Florida’s second walk-on, joining Oviedo na-
tive Jacob Kurtz. 
He is also the Gators’ third transfer this year. In the 
spring, Damontre Harris and Dorian Finney-Smith trans-ferred to Florida from South Carolina and Virginia Tech, re-spectively.Both forwards are ineligible to play for UF this season. Donovan joins an already loaded Gators backcourt, which 
features returning guards Kenny Boynton, Scottie Wilbekin, Mike Rosario and Kurtz. Freshmen Braxton Ogbueze, Mi-chael Frazier II and Dillon Graham are also joining the group 
in 2012. 
“It’s going to be great to have 
Billy here, both for our team and for our family,” coach Donovan said in 
a release. 
“I always want to be supportive and put him in a posi-
tion to succeed, and I hope this will be a great experience for him.”hoops , from page 13David Carr / Alligator s taff
Junior cornerback Jaylen Watkins returns an interception during 
UF’s 14-6 win against LSU on Saturday in The Swamp.
Gators forcing more turnovers in 2012
Florida finished last season 
ranked 113th in turnover margin, 
but UF ranks 19th through five 
games this season. 
The Gators have 10 takeaways: 
three fumble recoveries and seven 
interceptions.
UF intercepted only eight pass-
es all of last season.
While Watkins’ film sessions 
have helped him this season, he has gone up against his All-Amer -
ica brother his entire life.
“It evens out sometimes,” he 
said. 
“Sometimes, he gets me. Some-
times, I get him.”
Gators to face versatile quarter -
back: Jordan Rodgers is the little 
brother to NFL superstar Aaron 
Rodgers, but the Gators know him 
as the pesky, dual-threat quarter -
back from Vanderbilt.The Commodores came within 
five points of upsetting the Gators during UF’s homecoming game 
last season in Gainesville. 
Rodgers amassed 297 yards 
passing and two touchdowns while 
adding 20 yards and a touchdown on the ground.
“He hurt us with his legs last 
year, and he hurt us throwing the ball,” Muschamp said on Mon-day.
 “We had some pass-rush issues 
last year as far as discipline was concerned up front and keeping him in the pocket, but he was also accurate with the football.”
Rodgers has another shot at 
Florida on Saturday in Nashville, Tenn.
The redshirt senior is averaging 
35.2 yards of total offense more 
per game than Florida quarterback 
Jeff Driskel.
Only one of Rodgers’ carries 
against the Gators last season went 
for negative yards, but he lost 21 
yards on two sacks.
Three of his 13 rushing attempts 
went for 8 yards or more.
“They can run the ball, they can 
throw the ball and they’ve got a mobile quarterback,” linebacker Jon Bostic said. 
“We’ve got to keep the quarter -
back contained. We can’t let him get out of the pocket like we did last year. We’ve got to be able to stop the run.”

Coach Mary Wise said block-
ing is typically a veteran strength. 
Freshman Gabby Mallette didn’t get the memo.
The 6-foot-2 outside hitter 
chalked up eight of the Gators’ 28 blocks this weekend, including six in No. 11 Florida’s comeback win against Kentucky on Sunday. Mal-lette, who leads all UF freshmen in blocks, has given her coach an unexpected defensive weapon. 
“The blocking piece is some-
thing that’s usually more typical 
of a skill that comes around later 
in the development of a college player,” Wise said. “But Gabby is very physical above the net, and she plays high above the net. To be this good a blocker this early in her career, we think that Gabby 
has got a chance to be one of the 
best left-side blockers to have ever come through this program.”
The Orange Park product start-
ed to emerge as a key member of the Gators’ defense on Sept. 14, when Florida took on Arkansas to begin its Southeastern Conference schedule.
Mallette made her first ca-
reer start and played all five sets 
against the Razorbacks in Fay-
etteville, Ark. She set new career highs across the board with 10 kills, 27 swings and three blocks. Less than a week earlier, against Georgia Tech on Sept. 8, she regis-tered a -.375 hitting clip and zero kills or blocks. 
“She’s one of those players, be-
cause of her athleticism and how hard she’s working, she’s just get-ting better and better as the sea-
son is going on,” Wise said.
In Mallette’s first seven match-
es, she never started and recorded 
only two blocks. In her last seven matches, she has started four times and totaled 21 blocks. Wise said Mallette impacted Sunday’s win, calling the blocking performance one of the major factors that kept 
the Gators in the game.
“She had [six] blocks and some 
at a really key time against one of 
the best right-side players we’ll play against,” Wise said. “The dif-ference in the match, until our of-fense was on track, was the play at the net, especially by our block-ers.”
The freshman outside hitter’s 
most important blocks against UK came in the fourth set, when UF was trying to tie the game at two sets. With Florida holding a slim lead, she teamed up with Betsy Smith for a stuff and then com-bined with Chloe Mann on anoth-er to help seal the victory.
Mallette said front-line defense 
is critical. 
“The momentum from that and 
the energy that we get from that, it’s just one play that can take us as far as we can,” she said.
Wise said the freshman’s role 
is simple. 
“‘Just hit and block, Gabby,’” 
Wise said. “‘That’s what we need you to do.’” ADAM LICHTENSTEIN

she was not a rusted boot.

had something to prove.
In the 75th minute, she shook 
off the rust.
With the game still scoreless, 
Tymrak let a ball pass through her legs to sophomore Lauren Sil-ver. Tymrak made a run into the box, received a pass from Silver 
and poked the yellow ball past 
the LSU keeper, giving Florida the only goal it would need in an eventual 2-0 victory.
“It kind of gave me a little con-
fidence boost,” Tymrak said. 
Tymrak eased her way back 
onto the field against LSU, rack-ing up 42 minutes off the bench. 
Against then-No. 5 Texas A&M 
on Sunday, she played 88 min-utes.
Tymrak was again involved in 
the deciding goal against the Ag-gies.
In the 39th minute, Tymrak 
and sophomore Havana Solaun passed the ball back and forth 
before Tymrak dished it to junior Adriana Leon at the top of the 
box. Leon drilled the ball over the head of keeper Jordan Day for the game-winning goal.“I just remember Erika tossing 
it out in front, and then it was just the perfect ball to finish,” Leon said.For her efforts, Tymrak was 
named Offensive Player of the 
Week by the Southeastern Con-
ference on Monday. Tymrak has won the award twice this season. 
“She obviously made an im-
pact on the weekend,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “She’s an in-tegral part of our success.”
After inconsistent perfor -
mances during the nonconfer -
ence schedule and the beginning of SEC play, Florida’s offense came alive during Tymrak’s ab-sence, scoring 11 goals in three games.  When Tymrak returned, her teammates said the senior had no trouble meshing.
“It was pretty easy for the 
team and for her,” Leon said.
Tymrak was more critical of 
her play.
“[The team] knew I was a little 
hesitant and maybe a little out of shape from taking a week or two off,” she said. “But they’re behind me the whole way, and 
the coaches completely had my 
back.”
Tymrak said the Gators had 
become much better at moving the ball up the field in her ab-sence. Senior Holly King said Tymrak missing three games might actually help the offense in the future.
“When she was out, we had 
other people scoring,” King said. “When teams see that, they can’t just mark her now.”
Though the Gators offense saw 
significant improvement while Tymrak was out, the All-Ameri-can’s return provides a boost.
“Her coming back just gives 
the team an extra flair going for -
ward,” King said.WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 10, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

FOR 61 YARDS AGAINST LSU.

  Florida defeated LSU on Saturday, and it 
did so despite minimal production from Jeff 
Driskel. He wasn’t satisﬁ  ed with just getting the win.
  “I had opportunities,” Driskel said, “and I 
didn’t take advantage.” 
  Driskel’s success was limited in the ﬁ  rst 
half. He was sacked ﬁ  ve times and completed 5 of 8 passes for 31 yards. The coaches shifted 
their focus to the ground game at halftime, 
amassing 34 carries for 160 yards while pass-
ing just four times in the second half.
  Offensive coordinator Brent Pease said 
Driskel didn’t play poorly, but the sopho-
more signal caller expected more from him-
self.
  “I don’t think he struggled,” Pease said. 
“Maybe he was getting a little frustrated. We 
knew that was going to happen. His matu-
rity is improving every week.”
  Driskel said the onus will fall on him and 
the receivers to move the ball if holes disap-pear in the run game.
  “When you start hitting more runs, hit-
ting more big plays, [the defense will] start 
coming up,” Driskel said. “When they start coming up, there’s more chances to hit it 
over their heads.”
  Those chances haven’t been there often 
through ﬁ  ve games. Florida is tied for 104th 
in the country in passing plays of 20 yards or 
more with 11. Both Frankie Hammond Jr.’s 
50-yard touchdown against Bowling Green 
and his 75-yard touchdown in Florida’s win 
at Tennessee were on throws that traveled 
roughly 10 yards in the air.
  Driskel has also struggled to get rid of the 
football when pressured.
  Against Texas A&M in College Station, 
Texas, on Sept. 8, UF allowed a season-high eight sacks. Pease said only two were due 
to lapses in pass protection. Against LSU, 
Driskel held onto the ball too long on several occasions, including a crucial fumble near 
the end of the ﬁ  rst half that led to a Tigers ﬁ  eld goal.
  Driskel was not sacked against Tennessee 
and took only three against Kentucky, but he 
said he needs to learn when to throw the ball 
away.
  “There’s just times I could have gotten 
rid of the ball on time, and when I didn’t the window closed up, he looked like he was 
covered,” Driskel said. “When that happens 
you have to throw it away.”
  Driskel said quickly getting the ball out of 
his hands is not the only key to success.
  “We have to have better timing in the 
passing game,” he said. “The drops have to match up to the route, and I have to get rid of 
the ball on time instead of moving up a little bit or patting the ball a couple extra times.”
  Driskel and Pease are conﬁ  dent the pass-
ing game will step up when needed, as is linebacker Jon Bostic.
  “They’re making plays on us in practice, 
so we see they can throw the ball,” Bostic said.
