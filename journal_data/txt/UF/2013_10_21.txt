COLUMBIA, Mo. — Florida’s 
season is becoming more exasperat-
ing by the game.
A year after going 11-2 and earn-
ing a trip to the Sugar Bowl, the Gators feature an offense incapable of consistently scoring points and a wounded defense suddenly too willing to allow them. 
No. 22 Florida’s most recent 
meltdown — a humiliating 36-17 loss to No. 14 Missouri on Saturday at Faurot Field — leaves the Gators searching for answers that have so far been difﬁ  cult to ﬁ  nd. 
“We’re just not a good football 
team — certainly not today — and it falls on my shoulders,” a furious coach Will Muschamp said after the game. “We’re inept offensively. We have a hard time running it and cer-tainly can’t protect very well.”
Florida, which has already sur-
passed its loss total from last season, is suffering from several weakness-es on both sides of the ball — none more glaring than the recent abys-mal play of its offensive line. Lack-ing a ﬁ  rm foundation, the offense has sputtered the past two weeks as the Gators have lost back-to-back games for the ﬁ  rst time since Octo-ber 2011. 
Florida’s offensive line has al-
lowed 10 sacks and 13 hurries during the past two games, forcing quarter-back Tyler Murphy to scramble to make plays countless times. Against Missouri, Murphy ﬁ  nished 15-of-29 passing for a paltry 92 yards — by far his weakest outing of the season. 
Kelvin Taylor had his second 
strong game in a row, rushing 12 times for 74 yards and a touchdown in the loss, but mostly disappeared after breaking a 20-yard touchdown out of the Wildcat formation to pull Florida within six with 46 seconds remaining in the third quarter. 
“We struggle to do anything we 
try to do,” Muschamp said. “We try and spread it out and try and throw it, and we can’t protect the quarter-back. When we try to grind it out, we’re not getting creating enough explosive runs. We need to ﬁ  nd some answers, and right now we’re not ﬁ  nding any.”
Florida ﬁ  nished with a season-
low 151 yards of offense in the game, which began with temperatures in the mid-40s. The output was the program’s fewest since 1999. 
“I’m just very disappointed that 
we haven’t made more positive strides offensively this season,” Muschamp said. “We regressed again from last week. We’ll go back and work extremely hard to get those things corrected.”
Missouri (7-0, 3-0 Southeast-
ern Conference) scored the ﬁ  nal 13 points of the game to seal the victo-ry. The Tigers now sit atop the SEC Eastern Division by two games fol-lowing the win and losses by No. 11 South Carolina and No. 15 Georgia. Florida (4-3, 3-2 SEC) will re-
quire quite a bit of help to have any chance of making the SEC Cham-pionship Game. Forget Atlanta – at this point the Gators should be more concerned with locking up bowl eli-gibility. 
Teams must win at least six games 
to become bowl eligible, meaning Florida will have to beat two of its remaining opponents — Georgia, Vanderbilt, South Carolina, Georgia Southern and Florida State. 
Vanderbilt upset Georgia 31-27 
on Saturday. Excluding Georgia Southern, each of the other three

In celebration of the chain’s ﬁ  ve-year 
anniversary, a local sushi restaurant is 
rolling back menu prices to $5.
How Do You Roll?, at 1802 W. University 
Ave., is selling every roll — including tuna, salmon, steak and chicken — at the reduced prices until Halloween.
“The average ticket for one roll usually 
comes up to about $8 to $10. But this month, anything over $5 will start off at $5 or less,” said Brittany McGee, marketing director of the franchise.The franchise came to Gainesville this 
March.
It offers an experience different from 
other sushi restaurants nearby, said Matt Aschenbrener, manager of the Gainesville branch. All the food made to serve is cooked in less than three minutes.
“We don’t make you go through 
that 15-minute sit-down wait like other franchises,” he said.
But Kelly Brown, a 20-year-old UF food 
science and human nutrition junior, said she’s skeptical.
“Fast-food sushi sounds a little sketchy 
to me,” she said.Sushi shop chops prices to $5SEE FOOTBALL, PAGE 16

Oct. 21, 1965
A phone call landed a UF student and a UF drop-
out in jail. The two were charged by the FBI with using an interstate telephone call in an attempt to defraud the student’s father. The UF dropout made the call and said, “We’ve got your son. It’s going to cost you $10,000 if you want to see him again.” 
Oct. 25, 1988A fraternity faced termination of its charter be-
cause of Boink the cat. Sigma Nu members gave the cat to one of their female friends, who later left the fraternity. This ended in a custody battle of sorts, with members trying to forcefully take the cat back from the girl, refusing to leave her apartment for more than two hours. Police recommended the members be charged with trespassing and criminal mischief.
Oct. 21, 1994A bar closed its doors to nude dancers but wanted 
to make sure residents knew it was doing so volun-tarily. Cafe Expresso, the only nude bar downtown, reached an agreement with city officials to close down until a permanent decision was made.

Gainesville Police arrested a local man late Friday after he 
hid drugs in a woman’s pants.
Officers arrested Corey Levon Gregg, 29, on charges of 
methamphetamine sale and marijuana possession, according 
to a police report.
At about 10:30 p.m., an officer pulled over a car driven by 
Gainesville resident Candice Thomas. Gregg was in the pas-senger seat. The officer could smell marijuana on Thomas during the stop. After a search yielded no results, the officer asked about the smell. Thomas reached into her pants and pulled out two bags, one with about eight grams of crystal meth and the other with about one gram of marijuana, according to the report.  
Thomas told the officer the drugs be-
longed to Gregg. When the officer pulled 
the car over, she said Gregg told her to hold them and shoved them down her pants. The amount of meth is more than what is typically consumed by a user, and Gregg 
didn’t have any tools to ingest it, according to the report.
Officers booked Gregg into jail at about 1 a.m. Saturday, 
where he remained Sunday night with a $51,000 bond.Man arrested after drugs-in-pants demand

A bright green Naked Juice truck 
greeted students who walked by Gator Corner Dining Center on Friday.
The truck visited UF as part of Naked 
Juice’s national college campus tour. Tour manager Bryan Evans said  four trucks visit about five schools a week. He said the tour began Sept. 1 and will finish Nov. 15.
The tour works to promote the juice 
brand. Evans said the tour has nothing to do with a lawsuit filed earlier this year that claimed the brand falsely mar-keted the juice as “all natural.”
Students who stopped at the truck 
were also able to enter a contest to win a free beach cruiser bicycle.
Katie Smith, a 19-year-old UF ac-
counting freshman, sipped a Mighty Mango juice sample and said  expensive prices keep her from consistently con-suming it.
Evans said the tour will visit the Uni-
versity of North Florida, Jacksonville University, the University of Tampa, Florida Atlantic University and Florida International University as part of its Southeastern concentration.
“What college kid doesn’t like free 
stuff?” he said. Naked Juice promotes product at UFCOLLEEN WRIGHT

Even in the midst of a makeover, the Reitz Union is 
still on top.
The 46-year-old Reitz Union snagged the No. 5 spot on 
Best College Reviews’ recently released 25 Most Amazing 
Campus Student Unions list.
Reitz Union Executive Director Eddie Daniels said the 
Reitz’s diversity of unique services and programs such as GatorNights is what makes the Reitz one of the best stu-dent unions in the country.
“It’s a nice piece to have out there about the Reitz 
Union and UF,” he said.
The list was based on factors such as architectural no-
tability and student satisfaction, according to an online news release.
James Arney, the article’s author, gave the Reitz a nod 
for its services, including the game room, the Reitz Union Cinema and the Reitz Union hotel. 
Arney was unable to be reached for comment.Sarah Frick, executive director of student involvement 
of the Union expansion and renovation, compared the Re-itz to a living room on campus.
She said the Reitz received a high rank because its pro-
gramming is accessible to every student.
“Everyone can find something to relate to in that build-
ing,” said the 22-year-old psychology and public relations senior.
Frick said the building’s renovations will boost the Re-
itz’s ranking by offering more meeting and study space to students.TOP 10 UNIONS

Stress-relieving therapies 
may help people cut through 
the crap.
An article published by 
two UF professors shows alternative treatments to functional bowel disorders. Although research is not conclusive, mind-body treat-ments such as yoga, hypno-therapy, cognitive therapy and biofeedback were shown to relieve symptoms of  func-tional bowel disorders such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating and constipation.
Oliver Grundmann, a 
clinical assistant professor in the UF College of Pharmacy, and Saunjoo Yoon, associ-ate professor in the College of Nursing, reviewed 19 re-search studies about comple-mentary or alternative medi-cine published between June 2002 and June 2012 for evi-dence of the benefits of dif-ferent therapies, according to a news release.
Although there was not 
enough evidence to fully support mind-body treat-ments, hypnotherapy and cognitive behavior therapy showed a relief in symptoms, along with standard treat-ments such as pharmaceuti-cals, Grundmann said.
Irene Estores, medical di-
rector for UF Health’s Inte-grative Medicine Program, said she was familiar with the research.
“If I were to choose a 
mind-body therapy for func-tional disorders, I would probably choose hypnother-apy,” Estores said. “Based on my understanding of the current literature, I do have a personal interest in hypno-sis.”
Grundmann said in addi-
tion to the standard pharma-cy drugs that are being used to treat symptoms, some of the alternative therapies im-prove quality of life for many people.
“For example, hypnother-
apy has shown a long-lasting effect even beyond the initial treatment,” he said.Therapies may let

MELROSE, Fla. — Watching the 
Gators struggle against Missouri 
in the Blue Water Bay restaurant, a Florida Libertarian governor candi-date ate fried fish and waited.
Adrian Wyllie hoped to meet 
with potential voters, but few were found at about 3 p.m. Saturday.
“We’re the underdog, no doubt,” 
Wyllie said. “And, quite frankly, winning the election is a long shot, but it’s a realistic one.”Earlier that day at the 1890s Day 
Festival in McIntosh, about 30 miles south of Melrose, 500 people listened to his plan to protect Florida from an overbearing government. 
With nearly 800 volunteers and 
a goal of 1,000 who are dedicated to his cause, Wyllie said he has hope, even though his rumored oppo-nents, like incumbent Gov. Rick Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist, can outspend Wyllie, he said.
Joté Thompson, who has cam-
paigned for Wyllie, said personal interaction is key.“You can’t win without going 
door-to-door,” he said.
Wyllie’s platform includes an 
economic plan that would lower taxes, slash regulations claimed to stifle small business and bar the federal government from interfer-ing with the state’s economy. He is one of two Libertarian candidates registered in the gubernatorial race, which has 21 candidates registered in total, according to  the Florida Di-vision of Elections website. Voting in the governor’s race will begin in the August 2014 primary election.

UF engineering students are inspired by the young inventors’ work
reported on the invention.
“I figured it’d be kind of a hit in the southeast kind of area, 
but definitely not India, Brazil and Canada,” said Tyler Parker, a 24-year-old UF mechanical engineering alumnus and the other creator. 
The Chill Bit, which attaches to a drill, sells for $15. The 
Beerouette, a larger, self-powered unit, sells for $35. They can be preordered at spinchill.com, with delivery estimated for No-vember.
David Whitney, a UF engineering adjunct professor, re-
cently invited Abbott and Parker to present Spin Chill to his engineering innovation course.
“It was the perfect example of what I said to students from 
the moment they stepped foot in engineering innovation,” Whitney said. “I could see or feel the proverbial lightbulb go off in their heads: This is how innovators do their work.”
Some people didn’t think it would be a hit at all. When Ab-bott and Parker pitched Spin Chill at a hackathon in Atlanta, it was an unconventional proposal among the ideas.
“Everybody was talking about all these apps they were gon-
na make, and I was like, ‘I’m gonna make this thing that spins beers to cool them down,’” Parker said. “And nobody wanted to get on the team.”
But Connor Jacobsen, one of Whitney’s students, is rec-
ognizing the value of the idea. The 20-year-old UF computer engineering junior said the example shows students can do incredible things.

Peanuts kept Jessica Bell from 
having sleepovers and joining the 
Girl Scout troops.
Bell, a 22-year-old UF dance se-
nior, grew up with a food allergy to milk, nuts and peanuts. Her first reaction was when her brother gave her Reese’s Pieces when she was 2 years old.
Bell’s parents or grandparents 
came to her school lunch every day to make sure other students didn’t do anything to cause her to have an allergic reaction.  
College campuses across the 
country are introducing allergy-safe food stations, and for UF students with food allergies like Bell, Gator Dining Services has taken action to make eating at UF more accessible.
“Our registered dietitian and food 
service directors regularly meet with students who identify themselves as having food allergies, gluten in-tolerances or special dietary needs,” Jill Rodriguez, marketing program manager for Gator Dining Services, wrote in an email.
She said over the past several 
years, there has been a steady in-crease in students with special di-etary needs who are seeking glu-ten-free dining options. Fresh Food Company and Gator Corner Dining Center have gluten-free pasta, pizza crust, cereal, bread, muffins and cookies available upon request.
Gator Dining has a food-allergy 
support program that includes train-ing and education for operators, and consumer education and awareness. There are precautions taken during food preparation to avoid cross-con-tamination, Rodriguez said.
Dr. Shih-Wen Huang, head of the 
allergy clinic in pediatrics at the UF College of Medicine, said peanut al-lergies are exceptional because they are very difficult to outgrow from sensitivity.
“Once you become allergic, it 
may take a very long time,” he said. “You have to learn to avoid it.”
The most common question 
people ask, Bell said, is if she would have an allergic reaction if someone kissed her after eating peanuts. But the only time her allergies interrupt her day-to-day routine is when she eats at a restaurant or flies on air-planes.
“It definitely is just part of my 
life,” she said.

� THE AFFORDABLE 
CARE ACT REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO COVER CONTRACEPTIVES.
JENSEN WERLEY
Alligator Staff Writer
jwerley@alligator.org
Some Southern Baptist 
churches and organizations 
are suing the government for the Affordable Care Act on the grounds that requiring employers to cover contra-ceptives is against religious freedom.
But Eddie Gilley, director 
of Gainesville-based Baptist Collegiate Ministries, said lo-cal Baptist churches are not involved with the lawsuit.
Each church has its own 
leadership to make decisions independently from other churches, he said.
“They’re in a lawsuit be-
cause leaders decided to take that action,” Gilley said. “It’s not a contraception issue. It’s an abortion issue. It’s having the government tell religious organizations they have to,  against their belief.”
But Brittany Langbauer, 
a 21-year-old UF elementary education senior and long-time Southern Baptist, said the lawsuits seem irrelevant. She said she’s never been taught contraceptives are against her religion.
“We don’t believe in abor-
tion, but family planning is responsible,” she said.
She said the lawsuits 
could stem from conservative Southern Baptists, who tend to have a negative view of birth control and believe un-married people will use it to have sex instead of for family planning.
“I’ve been to church my 
whole life,” she said. “I’ve never been preached against birth control.”
Langbauer said she didn’t 
see any religious aspect to em-ployers having to cover con-traception for employees.
“I’ve never thought of 
contraception as a religious issue,” she said. “No one ar-gues against employers cov-ering doctors visits or dental cleanings or any other medi-cation. That’s what I see it as: medication.”
Kylie Lacusky, the presi-
dent of UF’s branch of Vox: Voices for Planned Parent-hood, wrote in an email that she does not agree with the churches’ lawsuits.
“The affordable care act 
(sic) is helping a lot of Ameri-cans, especially women, and it’s unfortunate that these churches disagree with that,” said the 19-year-old UF his-tory junior. “I’m not a labor expert, but I do know that contraception coverage is a vital part of preventative care for many women. . . Refusing to cover part of an employee’s  basic health care does your employees a great disser-vice.”Gainesville

Oreos are like cocaine
This week, a scientiﬁ  c report caused national distress when 
it revealed Oreos are almost as addictive as cocaine.
It’s a bold claim, to be sure. The studies that backed 
this claim were performed on rats. Scientists used results from a previous study in which rats that were placed in a maze  learned to locate one of two rooms where they received a cocaine injec-tion or a placebo injection. The study showed that even after the injection supplies dried up, the rat would still hang out in the drug room.
This behavioral pattern is called “conditioned place prefer-
ence,” and it’s not a new concept. It’s related to Pavlov’s experi-ments. The Oreo experiment came into existence when research-ers wondered if junk food — in particular, Oreos — would have the same behavioral effect on the rats.
The rats that were trained on Oreos learned to frequent the 
Oreo room — just as the rats who received cocaine learned to frequent the cocaine room.
In order to further cement the results of the rat studies, scien-
tists dissected the brains of their rodent subjects.
”We found that there was a greater number of neurons that 
were activated in the brain’s pleasure center in animals that were conditioned to Oreos compared to animals that were con-ditioned to cocaine,” Researcher Joseph Schroeder told The At-lantic.
Schroeder said the results suggest high-fat, high-sugar foods 
produced by big food companies such as Nabisco stimulate the brain in the same way as drugs.
This is hardly breaking news. Earlier this year, Michael Moss, a New York Times reporter, 
released a book titled “Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us.” He detailed the ways junk-food producers put a ridiculous amount of effort into crafting the perfect amount of crunch in a potato chip. 
The unifying characteristic between all the food giants is 
their continued effort to calculate the right level of bliss and dis-satisfaction — or, in layman’s terms, the inability to eat a single potato chip.
The results of this study has stirred up a familiar conversa-
tion about obesity.
It’s easy to blame America’s inﬂ  ated obesity rates on the ad-
dictive nature of junk food. However, Oreos are available in many other countries in many other ﬂ  avors, including green tea ice cream Oreos in China and dulce de leche Oreos in Ar-gentina.
Many other factors play in the link between the prolifera-
tion of junk food in America and obesity. The sad fact is highly processed foods are cheaper and more accessible — especially in “food deserts,” or places where the only grocery store in a neighborhood may be a 7-Eleven.
As sensationalized reports make headlines, keep in mind 
that obesity isn’t a matter of weak willpower: It’s an issue root-ed in politics and a lack of social services — including education on proper nutrition and access to fresh fruits and vegetables.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFriday’s question: Are you going to be 
Miley Cyrus for Halloween? Today’s question: Do you use contraceptives?Citizens need to speak up for Dominicans 
While U.S. policies aren’t anywhere near perfect, 
they are progressive in comparison to situations abroad.
I was deeply shocked and sorry for the Dominican peo-
ple when I heard that a constitutional court stripped thou-sands of people of their citizenship and rights last month. 
The ruling stated that anyone born after 1929 who does 
not have at least one Dominican parent is now deemed illegal.
Most residents of foreign descent in the Dominican Re-
public are Haitian, because both cultures share the island of Hispaniola. 
A complicated history of war and economic differences 
between the two Caribbean countries still breeds prob-lems. Although the Haitian population has been a major cheap labor force in the neighboring country for decades, the conservative government has created reforms since the early 2000s to curtail the entry of more Haitian immi-grants.
Reuters reported there were 245,000 Dominican-born, 
ﬁ  rst-generation children of immigrants living in the coun-try, but the numbers of those affected by the ruling are probably much higher because it applies to generations before that, too.
In a couple of weeks, I’ll be taking a test that will de-
cide whether I can — ﬁ  nally — take the oath to become an American citizen.
After 18 years of living in the U.S. under several dif-
ferent labels of “immigrant,” I imagine the milestone of getting that navy passport will seem surreal and maybe ceremonious when, in fact, I’ve felt American for a long time.
Naturalization will mean I receive the rights any Amer-
ican would have at birth. It’s unthinkable that someone who is actually born in a country could be stripped of his or her citizenship.  
As a hypothetical exercise, imagine these measures ap-plied in the U.S.
You were born here. Your 
parents were born here. But your grandparents were born outside the U.S. and moved here at a young age. That’s three gen-erations living and working in a country and learning a language, culture and social structure.
Then, one day, someone is denied an ID because of his 
or her last name. He or she asks for a constitutional review of the decision. 
The court not only denies the claim but goes further to 
retroactively deny other American-born citizens of foreign descent their rights.
You’re suddenly stateless. You can’t vote, work, get 
medical care or even buy a cellphone.
It’s inconceivable in the U.S. for such a measure to take 
place. A recent Pew Research Center study shows that “virtually all (93%) of the growth of the nation’s working-age population between now and 2050 will be accounted for by immigrants and their U.S.-born children.”
If an identical measure was taken by the U.S., nearly 
our entire population would be “illegal.”
The court ruling is already receiving sharp criticism 
from abroad. 
Human rights groups like Amnesty International and 
the Inter-American Court of Human Rights are currently drafting a letter to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry to petition this violation of human rights.
Just as the leadership of the Central Electoral Board has 
chosen to support the decision publicly on different news outlets and social media, those around the world who support basic principles of human rights should voice contempt for it.

Early Thursday 
morning, Pres-ident Barack 
Obama  signed a bill that reopened the federal government and avoided a default on our nation’s debts. Yet again, a manufac-tured crisis was solved, and our elected ofﬁ  cials can rest easy.
Except — they can’t.In what’s become business as 
usual on Capitol Hill, the grand agreement devised by lawmak-ers simply funds the government and raises the debt ceiling until early next year. 
Hardly a solution to our coun-
try’s woes, wouldn’t you say?
The president himself an-
nounced Wednesday evening the nation must stop governing by crisis, and he’s right. How can our government expect to survive when it decides to operate just a few months at a time?
It’s controlled chaos, and if we 
continue down this path, eventu-ally the manufactured crises will take their toll, and the rest of the world will grow tiresome of our petty and childish ways.  
If the United States is sup-
posed to be an exceptional nation and is beloved around the world for our “freedom,” what in the hell happened to those govern-ing us?
Fear, anger and despair over 
lost elections guide a minority of our elected ofﬁ  cials who in turn subject the entire country to their warped sense of living. At this juncture, their only philoso-phy seems to be if they can’t win, no one can. No affordable health care, no reasonable or rational policies that might have a posi-tive effect on anyone, no noth-ing.
If the 2012 election was a refer-
endum on the policies of Obama, he won, and the Tea Party lost. Yet, those on the right refuse to accept the results and instead seem willing to hold the federal government hostage unless they get their way.
Is this truly how we want our 
government to operate?
We cannot live in the land of 
opportunity without a function-ing government. 
Our infrastructure will col-
lapse, the rest of the developed world will view the United States as a “has-been,” and rapid de-cline of American democracy will start.
Republicans in the Tea Party 
might think our country can function without government, but tell that to the farmers in the Dakotas desperate for assistance after their cattle perished in a recent blizzard. Tell that to the Cen-ters for Disease Con-trol and Prevention’s furloughed employ-ees, who couldn’t 
track a salmonella outbreak and feared what might happen if ﬂ  u season arrived amidst a govern-ment shutdown.
Whether you like it or not, the 
federal government is a necessi-ty, and regardless of the rhetoric spewed forth from the mouths of Tea Party darlings like Ted Cruz or Sarah Palin, this country will cease to exist without a function-ing government.
The United States can be a 
great country, and often times, it has lived up to its billing. 
However, unless our elected 
ofﬁ  cials recognize that crises they themselves create are not going to lead to prosperity, they will make America exceptional at one thing: failing to be a model of successful representative government.
If we remain on the path of 
manufactured crises, pushed mostly by the minority of a mi-nority party, this great experi-ment in representative democra-cy might very well be damned. 
Whether Republicans want to 
admit it, Democrats in Congress received 1.4 million more votes in 2012.
Tea Partiers might believe they 
have the freedom to shut the gov-ernment down when they don’t get their way, but their philoso-phy feels far more like a temper tantrum than democracy. 
The difference is when chil-
dren throw tantrums, they usu-ally have an impact that affects their parents and themselves, not the livelihoods of 300 million people.
It’s up to us as voters, Ameri-
cans and students who want jobs upon graduation to tell the Tea Party, Republicans, Democrats, independents and any others who may claim to represent the will of the American people to cease their endless charade and ﬁ  x the country. During the last 13 years, we’ve witnessed a con-tested presidential election, a devastating terrorist attack, two wars, an economic collapse and a nightmarish political situation in Washington.  
When will the madness end?We’re all waiting.Joel Mendelson is a UF graduate 
student in political campaigning. His column runs on Mondays.
The recent government 
shutdown symptomatic of larger problemsColumn
We’ve all been there. We all 
understand the perpetual struggle of going to an un-
desirable class at an undesirable time. Even though college students do not al-ways love attending class, we usually end up going because, deep down in our hearts, we know it’s the right thing to do for our education, future, parents and bank accounts. If you are one of these types of students, however, you should consider not going to class.
1. The kid on FacebookIf you’re going to scroll mindlessly through your 
news feed for an hour or stalk an old friend, you might as well stay home. You’ll gain absolutely nothing from sitting in a stuffy auditorium if you thoughtlessly look at Facebook, Instagram or Twit-ter for all of lecture.
2. The kid studyingIn general, studying is a good thing. 
If you are going to study for a class dur-ing the lecture of another class, how-ever, your time would be better spent walking to the library to study. Study-
ing for a cognitive science midterm is hard if you are listening to Robert Reich talk about the ﬁ  nancial disparities between the rich and the poor, and you’ll be hard-pressed to learn about economic inequality if you are riﬂ  ing through your cog sci notes.
3. The kid talkingIf you are going to sit and talk to the person next 
to you for the entire lecture, please do not go to class and force us innocent bystanders to listen to your mindless conversation about the weather.

In 2009, testifying in front of the House 
Committee on Education and the Work-force, then-Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.)  
insisted he ﬁ  nds it hard to argue for legis-lation that bans discrimination. He com-mented it was hard not because he in anyway condones discrimination, but rather that it was hard due to non-discrimination being so self-evident.
The speciﬁ  c piece of legislation Frank was comment-
ing on at the time was an Employment Non-Discrimina-tion Act bill, which he had introduced to the 110th Con-gress. Though the bill got plenty of bipartisan support, it was never passed into law. Today, in the land of the free and home of the brave, there is still no piece of federal legislation that protects citizens from being ﬁ  red or de-nied job opportunities based solely on who they are and who they love. My struggle with coming to terms with this is Frank’s struggle, in that I, too, cannot understand how to go about explaining something so self-evident.
Having an employment nondiscrimination law 
that protects LGBT citizens in every state across this great nation is something that is long overdue, and it has support from more than two-thirds of Americans. Hundreds of companies, including some of our nation’s most proﬁ  table, already have employment nondiscrimi-nation policies like this in place. There is no uncertainty about what our country’s next step needs to be.This year, U.S. senators will once again 
be voting on a version of the nondiscrimina-tion act. Activists who have supported this bill for years, senators who are willing to stand up for equality and individuals across 
America who know this is the right thing to do will in-evitably be faced with discriminatory questions that will boggle the mind. All the while, they will wonder how one can support the words of America’s most treasured documents and yet not support a basic piece of nondis-crimination legislation.
On Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., the UF Col-
lege Democrats’ LGBT Caucus will be hosting a day of action at our table on Turlington Plaza in order to high-light the importance of the act. 
We will be calling Sens. Marco Rubio and Bill Nel-
son and urging them to support the passage of the act. We ask that you stop by the table, make a call and show your support for equality. If this bill does not have a no-ticeable, direct impact on your life, I can certainly assure you it will have a big impact and be a huge deal to some-one who is your friend, loved one, co-worker, neighbor or classmate.
No one can afford to be indifferent or apathetic in a 
common-sense ﬁ  ght for human rights.

chair of the UF College Democrats LGBT Caucus.

Parachutists completed Airborne 
School training to participate in World 
War II re-enactments by jumping from a WWII C-47 named Tico Belle flown over the National Parachute Test Center in Dunnellon, Fla., on Saturday.
Above: Retired Capt. Dave DeSoucy, from Southern California, stands in line while instructing captains award jumpers with pins commemorating their parachute training completion.
Right middle: Jumpers descend from Tico Belle at 1,500 feet in WWII-
type round parachutes at the end of the ceremony.
Right: Maj. Ferdinand Jonker from South Africa stands in line with blood 
dripping from his chest while instructors give jumpers a second set of Parachutist Badges. After receiving his first badge, Jonker’s skin was pierced by the ritual punching in of the pin.Middle left: Shelves at the National Parachute Test Center hold parachutes and jump equipment while the participants wait to jump.
Bottom left: Jumpers were bestowed with several different 
Parachutist Badges, winged pins signifying the completion of their parachute training.Left: Brazilian jumper Paulo Sousa receives his “jump wings” by retired Marine Corps Maj. Robert Mathews. As an initiation rite for the graduates of the U.S. Army Airborne School, an instructor places the awarded pin on the graduates’ chest and punches it in, often unintentionally pushing it into their skin.
Right: Parachutists guide visitors on a 
tour of the interior and exterior of Tico Belle. The C-47 flew in the 1944 D-Day invasion of Normandy and is one of the few combat veteran planes still in flight today.

Jones repacks his parachute at the National Parachute Test Center before another flight with Mark Anderson, a fellow jumper from Phoenix.

Florida fell out of both the AP and USA Today Coaches’ Polls on Sunday. It is the ﬁ  rst time UF has been unranked since the end of the 2011 season.PHILLIP HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer @phillip_heilman
COLUMBIA, Mo. — The Gators’ offen-
sive-line woes do not seem to be improv-
ing anytime soon.
A week after appearing overmatched 
in a loss to LSU, the unit was again out-worked and outmuscled as No. 22 Florida fell to No. 14 Missouri 36-17 on Saturday in Faurot Field.
“We’re very disappointed,” right guard 
Jon Halapio said. 
“Probably more disappointed this week 
than last week. We’ve just got to ﬁ  x our problems, especially up front, and go from there.”
Following an underwhelming perfor-
mance against LSU that saw quarterback Tyler Murphy sacked four times and hur-ried four times, Florida chose to make changes along the offensive line.
D.J. Humphries, the incumbent starter 
at left tackle, was benched to start the game. In his place, left guard Max Garcia rotated to tackle and reserve Kyle Koehne was inserted into the starting lineup at guard.
The shufﬂ  ing proved to be fruitless 
as the offensive line suffered through its worst performance of the year.
Murphy was sacked a season-high six 
times and hurried on six other occasions as the Gators’ punchless offense mustered just one touchdown during the game.
“We’re struggling right now to get the 
right combination,” coach Will Muschamp said. 
“We’re doing everything we can do. 
We shufﬂ  ed guys around. We’ve just got to get better.”
For Florida’s third-year coach, the fail-
ures of the offensive line are especially frustrating. 
Since taking over prior to the 2011 sea-
son, he has looked to renovate the unit he once called soft into a foundation for a successful power offense.
Entering the 2013 season, he seeming-
ly had succeeded. Florida returned three key cogs from last year’s unit — Halapio, Humphries and center Jon Harrison — while adding transfers Tyler Moore and Max Garcia for increased stability.
Through seven games this season, that 
plan has hit a severe snag.
“I didn’t see this happening,” Halapio 
said of the inconsistency that has plagued Florida’s offensive line. “We’ve just got to

Gators struggle in trenches
� TAYLOR LED FLORIDA 
IN RUSHING YARDS.
PHILLIP HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer @phillip_heilman
COLUMBIA, Mo. — Kel-
vin Taylor continues to shine 
for a Gators offense that has had few bright spots during the past two weeks.
Taylor, a freshman running 
back, ﬁ  nished with a career-high 74 rushing yards and a touchdown on 12 carries dur-ing No. 22 Florida’s 36-17 loss to No. 14 Missouri on Satur-day at Faurot Field.
“He did a good job of hit-
ting the hole and getting to the second level,” quarterback Tyler Murphy said. “He did a good job making a few guys miss and getting us to the end zone.”
Taylor, who carried the 
football 10 times for 52 yards against LSU in place of run-ning back Matt Jones (knee), accounted for nearly half of Florida’s offense on Saturday. UF ﬁ  nished with a season-low 151 yards against a stout Mis-souri defense.
His third-quarter touch-
down — a 20-yard plunge that came when he took a han-doff from Trey Burton out of the Wildcat package — was the ﬁ  rst of Taylor’s career and cut the Gators’ deﬁ  cit to 23-17 with 46 seconds remaining in the third quarter.
“Kelvin’s a natural, instinc-
tive runner,” coach Will Mus-champ said.
With Jones out for the sea-son after suffering a torn me-niscus in the ﬁ  rst half against LSU, Florida has split carries between Taylor and redshirt junior Mack Brown. Against Missouri, Brown was much less effective, carrying the ball eight times for just 19 yards — a 2.4 yards per carry average that was less than half of Tay-lor’s 6.2 yards per attempt.
“I see a lot of growth out 
of him,” right guard Jon Hala-pio said of Taylor. “He’s been very productive in practice. He’s got great vision and ev-erything. He had a game. Just wish we could have did a bet-ter job for him.”
Safety ejected: Few top-
ics draw the ire of Muschamp like the NCAA’s new target-ing rule. For the second time this season, he and the Gators were forced to deal with its consequences.
Halfback leads weak UF offense
There’s no denying 
it now. The Gators aren’t very good. 
Gone is the swagger 
the team carried last year. Instead, there is crippling uncertainty on both sides of the ball. 
This is about more than three loss-
es through its ﬁ  rst seven games. It’s about an attitude adjustment needed in Gainesville.
It’s time to get mean. Missouri pushed Florida around 
on Saturday. The Gators’ offense was inept, as coach Will Muschamp described. The defense looked like it was still wrought with jet lag. It was embarrassing. This season has been embarrassing.Florida is supposed 
to be one of the top pro-grams in the Southeastern Conference — if not the country. It’s muddling in mediocrity. 
Season-ending inju-
ries to four key starters 
and seven former starters on defense gone to the NFL isn’t an excuse.
Ask the players and coaches them-
selves. The “man down, man up,” mantra is on a never-ending loop throughout the football complex.
Look at the past ﬁ  ve recruiting 
classes, which brought in freshmen like Vernon Hargreaves III. Redshirt seniors like Jon Harrison anchor its Florida not living up to 
lofty program standardsTHE ADAM BOMB

“Is Red Sox a fancy way of writing Socks or is Sox something else?” 
Nora Neset Gjoen (@nngjoen) 
UF goalkeeper on the World-Series bound Boston Red SoxCody Riggs, who starts along-
side Jaylen Watkins at safety, 
was disqualified on the first play of the game against Missouri af-ter being flagged for a targeting penalty against Missouri wide receiver L’Damian Washington following a 41-yard completion down the right sideline.
“I don’t disagree with the 
call,” Muschamp said. “I disagree with kicking a kid out of a game in that situation. He wasn’t ma-liciously trying to hurt anybody. It’s ridiculous.”
Riggs is the second Gators  
player ejected under the rule, which also draws a 15-yard pen-alty. Brian Poole was disqualified during the second half against Tennessee on Sept. 21.
Because Riggs’ infraction oc-
curred prior to halftime, he will not have to sit out the first half of Florida’s next game.
Injuried Gators: UF an-
nounced early Saturday morn-ing that linebacker Ronald Pow-ell and defensive tackle Damien Jacobs would not play against Missouri after suffering injuries against LSU.
Powell traveled with the team 
to continue receiving treatment on his ankle. Jacobs stayed home with “lingering effects” from a hit suffered after his helmet was knocked off in a pile-up near the goal line last week.
Reserve linebacker Darrin 
Kitchens missed the game with a shoulder injury.
Jaylen Watkins (right hand) 
and Jeremi Powell (left knee) were injured during the game and will be evaluated this week. Loucheiz Purifoy (left hand) was treated by UF’s medical staff be-fore returning to the game.
2009 group. Florida is ranked in 
the top 15 for all of them. Its two-deep would start on most teams throughout the country. Heck, most of its roster could start on Missouri. 
So where has Florida gone 
wrong this season? 
Offensively, the creativity isn’t 
there. The Gators are predictable.
Score just enough and let their 
defense keep them in the game has been their philosophy. 
Maybe that has something to do 
with junior Jeff Driskel suffering a fractured right fibula on Sept. 21, but he hadn’t made the progress everyone expected in his second season as starter.
A Trey Burton direct snap here, 
a two-yard run there; the Gators just haven’t been giving Driskel’s replacement, redshirt junior Tyler Murphy, doable third-down op-portunities. 
Florida had 5 or more yards to 
go on 12 of its 15 third-down op-portunities on Saturday and con-verted only three of them.
Defensively, the once invincible 
unit now seems ordinary against the run. Missouri racked up 500 to-tal yards on offense, including 205 on the ground. 
Dating back to Arkansas on 
Oct. 5, opponents have averaged 164  yards per game. Defensive tackle Dominique 
Easley missing the remaining nine games of the season hurt, but it was by no means a death sentence. Somebody has to take the blame 
for this season besides the unre-lenting football gods. 
How does Driskel, the nation’s No. 1 quarterback recruit in 2011, not take a major leap forward this season? How does a team with the No. 4 defense in America not play better? How is senior Solomon Pat-ton the only playmaking receiver on a team that can get pretty much any high school receiver it wants in the country? How is scoring 21 points per game still acceptable?
These past two decades have 
been a renaissance for Florida football. If you think this is bad, try reading about the Gators’ his-tory before Steve Spurrier’s head coaching tenure in the early 90s. It isn’t pretty.
With most UF undergraduates 
never associating Gators football with mediocrity, nobody cares about what seems like ancient his-tory. 
I’m pretty sure the 17-and-18-
year-old high school football play-ers who will be on campus soon don’t care about it either.
It may be a relatively recent tra-
dition of success, but it’s time the Gators tap into that again. 
If not, Florida will start a new 
reputation about its program that could impact the quality of the players it brings in.
Florida used to be sexy. Now 
it’s downright ugly.14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, OCTOBER 21, 2013

Behind a shaky line, Murphy turned in his least im-
pressive numbers since taking over for Jeff Driskel during 
the first quarter against Tennessee on Sept. 21.
He completed just 15 of 29 passes for a meager 92 yards 
and was consistently forced to roll out on passing downs to avoid pressure and buy additional time.
“I want to spread it out like everybody 
else does, but you know what? We have a hard time protecting the quarterback — more than most teams do,” Muschamp 
said. “You watch the games. We need to get better.”
Missouri defensive lineman Michael Sam led the onslaught. He collected three of the team’s six sacks as the Tigers (7-0, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) limited the Gators (4-3, 3-2 SEC) to 151 yards of total of-fense, the fewest by a UF offense since 1999.
“They have a good bunch, a good front over there,” 
said Murphy, who battled a sore shoulder that kept him out of practice until Thursday of last week. 
“They did a good job of finding ways to bring more 
people than we could protect.”

When it came to taking down 
one of the top teams in the South-
eastern Conference, Savannah Jordan was ready.
After going scoreless against 
Kentucky on Friday, the fresh-man forward netted both of her shots to help secure Florida’s 3-0 victory against LSU (9-5-2, 5-2-1 SEC) at James G. Pressly Stadium on Sunday.
In the 23rd minute, freshman 
midfielder Pamela Begic sent an accurate cross to Jordan at the right side of the box. Jordan made a quick turn and shot the ball into the left corner of the net for Flori-da’s (12-3-1, 6-2 SEC) first goal.
Jordan looked to cushion the 
lead and set herself up on the right side of the box again.
The forward controlled the 
ball and sank her shot into the left corner from 16 yards out to give the Gators a 2-0 lead at halftime.
“Our team has been playing 
great these last couple games, moving the ball really well,” Jor-dan said. “I think it just opened up for me today, and I was excit-ed to get the goals.”
Jordan’s pair of goals puts 
her at 15 scored this season and marks her fifth multi-goal match in 2013.
Jordan said she used some of 
the techniques she learned during her U-18 National Team training last week. 
“The level of competition 
down there really pushed me even further,” Jordan said. “I learned some technical things and I’ve tried to apply those in the game this weekend.”
The freshman was not the only 
one who met the high level of competition and physicality LSU brought to the field.
The Gators found more oppor-
tunities as the game’s physicality increased in the second half.
LSU fouled Florida near the 
top of the box in the 60th minute, giving the Gators a free kick at close range.
Midfielder Annie Speese took 
the set piece and sank the ball past LSU goalkeeper Megan Kin-neman.
“We talked after halftime and 
told some of our forwards, ‘You know what, they’re being really physical at the top of the box, so see if you can draw a foul,’” Speese said. 
“We’ve been working a lot on 
free kicks in practice, and I just had a really good feeling when I stepped up on it. Havana [Solaun] looked at me and said, ‘Speese, you’re going to make this,’ and I was like, ‘OK, I can put this in.’”
Speese’s goal is her first this 
season and the 15th of her career.
After shutting out both LSU 
and Kentucky, Florida is tied for second in the league with Ken-tucky. Texas A&M sits atop the SEC with a 7-1 conference record.
With three games left in the 
regular season, Jordan said now more than ever is the time to keep their momentum going.
“[Coach Becky Burleigh] al-
ways emphasizes playing for each other and moving the ball, and I think we really did that this weekend,” Jordan said. 
“Each one of us played for the 
person next to us, and I think that really paid off. If we can keep fo-cusing on that and enforcing that this week, then I think we’ll be good for the [SEC Tournament].”

A combination of team 
and individual errors led to 
the Gators’ first Southeastern Conference loss of 2013.
Missouri dominated Flor-
ida on Sunday in Columbia, Mo., as the Gators lost in four sets, 23-25, 23-25, 25-23, 18-25. It was UF’s first loss since  by Penn State swept the Gators on Sept. 8.
“They are not the leading 
team in the country in hitting percentage by mistake,” UF associate coach David Boos said of Missouri before the match. 
“They are really good at 
what they do.”
Missouri’s .303 hitting per-
centage and only 14 attack errors easily surpassed Flori-da’s hitting clip of .237 and 24 errors. Although the Gators had eight service aces — the Tigers recorded nine — they also committed seven serving errors. 
“It was a close match,” 
coach Mary Wise said in a postgame radio interview. “Just look at the numbers.
“The difference was that 
Missouri was insistent more ... Whether that was off serve receive or transition digs and our ball control just wasn’t at level it needs to be to beat this good (of) a team on the road.”
Florida dropped the first 
set of the match against Mis-souri, just like it had in Fay-etteville, Ark., during Friday’s match against Arkansas. 
The Gators came back from 
the deficit in four sets against the Razorbacks but could not duplicate those results in Co-lumbia.
But the high-pressure 
environment did not affect freshman right-side hitter Alex Holston, who reached a career high of 17 kills with only three attack errors.
“Alex played very well for 
us,” Wise said. “We’ve got to figure out how to get her the ball sooner and earlier in sets.”
Holston was up against 
Missouri’s star freshman and last week’s SEC Freshman of the Week, Carly Kan. 
“What a baller,” Wise said. 
“[Kan is] a game changer.”
In the second set, two at-
tack errors from sophomore Ziva Recek gave Missouri an early lead. The Gators were behind by as many as eight points. A kill and an ace by Holston and junior Taylor Unroe, respectively, closed the gap to 19-20. 
Florida rallied to tie the 
game on a  kill by Recek. But it was not enough. Missouri took the second set and a 2-0 advantage. 
The Gators had a lead in 
the third set until the 17th point. The Tigers rallied to tie the score at 23, but UF stayed alive and earned the next two points to win the set. 
Florida’s dropped fourth 
set sealed its second defeat of the season and first loss to Missouri since the team joined the SEC. 
“This was a great SEC 
match,” Wise said. 
“These teams went toe-to-
toe, and as the set scores indi-cated, it was very close.”

� HODSKINS WILL WALK ON TO TEAM IN 2014.

Zach Hodskins has taken the next step on his inspiring 
journey.
Hodskins, a 2014 basketball prospect who was born 
without half of his left arm, committed to the Gators via 
his Twitter account (@Z_B0) on Saturday night. 
The Alpharetta, Ga., native’s ability to play at a high 
level despite having only one hand caught the eye of UF’s coaching staff this summer. In August, Gators assistant coach John Pelphrey of-
fered Hodskins a preferred walk-on spot, which guaran-tees he would make the roster but not receive a full schol-arship. NCAA Division I basketball programs are allotted 13 scholarships. The Gators currently have 11 scholarship players.
After about two 
months of mulling the offer, Hodskins finally came to a conclusion.
“Iv [sic] officialy committed to the University of Flori-
da basketball,” Hodskins tweeted.
Hodskins visited UF this weekend and came away impressed, tweeting that Florida’s program is “off the charts.”
Despite missing an arm from the left elbow down, the 
6-foot-3, 175-pound Hodskins has showcased his strong court vision and three-point shooting ability while at Al-pharetta (Ga.) Milton High.
After UF offered Hodskins, he became a national story. 
During the following weeks, Hodskins made appearances on CNN and ABC’s Good Morning America. 
Hodskins is the third commitment in the Gators’ Class 
of 2014, joining four-star guards Chris Chiozza and Bran-done Francis. One-handed high school basketball player commits to UF

[Tournament].”

Landon Watnick / Alligator StaffMissouri jumped out to seven-point lead in game’s ﬁ  rst minute
teams entered the weekend ranked 
ahead of Florida. 
“Anything is possible,” Dante 
Fowler Jr. said. “I don’t feel like anything is out of reach. Anything can happen. We’re just going to keep going out there and keep play-ing football and who knows what could happen?”
If UF’s suddenly porous defense 
does not improve, nothing good will happen.
Florida’s usually dependable 
unit collapsed against Missouri. 
Anyone who arrived late to the 
game was in jeopardy of missing the start of Missouri’s offensive out-pouring. Mauk completed a pass to L’Damian Washington down the right sideline on the ﬁ  rst play from scrimmage for a gain of 41 yards. 
Cody Riggs was ﬂ  agged and 
disqualiﬁ  ed for targeting after ini-tiating helmet-to-helmet contact with Washington while attempt-ing to dislodge the ball on the play. Florida’s already depleted defense, which lost starters Ronald Powell and Damien Jacobs to injury during the week, grew thinner almost im-mediately. 
Mauk found Bud Sasser for a 20-
yard touchdown on the next play to set the tone just 22 seconds into the game. He ﬁ  nished the game 18-of-36 passing for 295 yards with one touchdown and one interception. “We’re all looking for answers 
right now,” Jaylen Watkins said. 
After Missouri’s opening drive, 
the Tigers leaned on tailback Henry Josey to shoulder the load. For the second consecutive game, an op-posing running back shredded Flor-ida’s rushing defense. 
Josey carried the ball 18 times for 
136 yards and a touchdown. 
Prior to last week at LSU, Florida 
had allowed just one ball carrier — Georgia’s Todd Gurley — to gain at least 100 yards on the ground since the start of the 2012 season. 
Josey is now the second back in 
as many weeks to eclipse the mark. LSU’s Jeremy Hill gashed the Gators for 121 yards on Oct. 12.
“We’ve never seen the score-board lit up like that on us the past two years,” Watkins lamented. 
Florida’s defense had two gold-
en opportunities in the second half to redeem an otherwise disastrous day. 
Solomon Patton returned the 
opening kick after halftime for a touchdown to cut the Gators’ deﬁ  cit to 13-10. Later in the third quarter, Taylor punched in a 20-yard touch-to cut Florida’s deﬁ  cit to 23-17. 
But Missouri, which gained 500 
yards of total offense while snap-ping Florida’s 13-game streak of holding SEC opponents to 20 points or fewer, marched down the ﬁ  eld for a touchdown following Patton’s return. 
The Tigers added a ﬁ  eld goal early in the fourth quarter after Tay-lor’s score.
“I tell our guys all the time, 
‘You’re the ﬁ  remen. You got to go put it out.’ Regardless of the situa-tion in the game, you’ve got to play a certain way,” Muschamp said. “When you don’t do that, you’re not doing your job. 
The team Muschamp hoped 
would be an SEC contender limps into its second bye week of the sea-son searching for solutions before Florida plays Georgia on Nov. 2 in Jacksonville. 
“I’m a competitor,” he said. “I’m 
going to ﬁ  ght my ass off. That’s what you do. You get your back against the wall and you ﬁ  ght your ass off. That’s what we’re going to do.”
