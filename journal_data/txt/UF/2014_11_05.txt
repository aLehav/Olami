STAFF REPORT
Minutes before Rick Scott became the 
fourth Florida governor to earn a second 
term, Gainesville’s young Republicans mixed conﬁ  dence with tequila shots.
“Cheers to the governor!” the group of 
about 40 shouted from the second ﬂ  oor deck at The Swamp restaurant in Midtown.
Plastic cups ﬁ  lled and reﬁ  lled with beer, women sipped wine, and the printed face of Charlie Crist was passed across tables. Some rubbed the face — for good luck, they ex-plained.
Maybe it was the rubbing, or maybe it 
was something else, but Scott was able to inch ahead and steadily lead Democratic candidate Crist as polls across Florida closed Tuesday night.
As of 10:40 p.m., nearly all counties had 
been reported, with Scott earning 48.3 per-cent of the vote — just 81,000 votes more than Crist, who lost by about 1.4 percentage points.
Scott’s win was just one of many for the 
Republican Party on Tuesday. Attorney Gen-eral Pam Bondi, whose stringent defense of Florida’s same-sex marriage ban has landed her in headlines across Florida this fall, won with 55.25 percent of state votes.
In Alachua County, Republican Ted 
Yoho secured re-election as a representative for District 3 in the Florida House of Rep-resentatives with 65.02 percent of the vote. Republican incumbent Keith Perry sealed his third term representing District 21 in the State House as well.
Republican incumbents Jeff Atwater and 
Adam Putnam also sealed seats as chief ﬁ  -nancial ofﬁ  cer and commissioner of agricul-ture, respectively.
But at the UF College Republicans cel-
ebration, conﬁ  dence didn’t come until the end of the night.
Adam Cross, the chairman of the Flori-
da Federations of College Republicans, sat scrolling through Twitter on his white Sam-sung Galaxy S3 shortly after the polls closed in Alachua County, watching numbers ﬂ  uc-tuate. Crist and Scott were tied. Then Crist was on top.
“Right now, I can’t make a judgment 
call,” Cross said. “I’m always worried on Election Day.”
Cross said he remembers being 18 and 
out of high school in 2008, looking for a job under Crist’s administration.
“It was impossible,” Cross said. “I 
couldn’t get a job at McDonald’s. I couldn’t get a job at Taco Bell.”
A few minutes later, updated polls came 
on the screen on CNN Live. Scott was up 47.9 percent to Crist’s 47.2 percent.

Following a major win against 
the University of Georgia Bull-
dogs, UF can also be proud of an 
increase in admission applica-
tions.
As of the Nov. 1 deadline, the university received 28,115 fresh-man applications for the Summer and Fall semesters.
This is an increase of 1,215 
more than the 2013 admissions deadline, wrote Steve Orlando, UF spokesman, in an email.
Interest in the Innovation 
Academy has also increased with 1,260 students indicating an inter-est in consideration, he said. That is an increase of 448 more than last year.
“We will continue to accept 
freshman applications through March 1 on a space available ba-sis,” Orlando said.
The acceptance rate in 2013 
was 45.6 percent, an increase from 
the previous acceptance rate of 39 
percent, he said.
Addressing the increase in the number of applicants, Orlando said it was due to several factors.
“The state’s population has 
grown markedly during the past ﬁ  ve to 10 years,” he said. “UF’s reputation as an excellent aca-demic institution has grown as well; and more people than ever 
recognize the remarkable value 
of a UF education — low cost and high quality.”Last year, about 12,923 appli-
cants were accepted. The univer-sity enrolled 6,400 students for the 
Summer B and Fall semesters.
The average GPA for appli-
cants into UF for Fall 2014 was 4.4, 
the average SAT was 1960 and the average ACT was 30.

on Thursday from 4 to 5:30 
p.m. in Library East, Room 100. One of the most obvious stylistic features of Athenian black-figure vase painting is the use of color to differentiate women from men. By com-paring ancient art in Egypt and Greece, Eaverly uncovers 
the complex history behind 
the use of color to distinguish between genders without fo-cusing on race. Light refresh-ments will be served.

Kelsey Hackett didn’t ex-
pect to be sitting, reading a 
novel with the lights out and 
the gates closed over Star-
bucks during her usual open-ing shift.
Gator Dining Services lost 
power in the Reitz Union food court for two hours Tuesday morning, except Subway, Pollo Tropical, Arredondo Cafe and P.O.D. Market.
Hackett, a 19-year-old 
Starbucks employee, said she was in the middle of making a latte for a customer when 
the power went out, and the 
espresso machine stopped working around 8:45 a.m.
“We had a lot of upset peo-
ple,” the UF fine arts sopho-
more said.
The employees gave cus-
tomers who had already paid 
free-drink vouchers so they could come back when the power was fixed.
 UF environmental man-
agement junior and Star-bucks employee Allie Crow said they were most worried 
about the products in the 
freezer. The supervisor and an employee had to move all the frozen products to the Freshens freezer downstairs 
in the Reitz Union.
When the power went out, the Starbucks employees completed all of their clean-
ing tasks for the day, and most of the morning crew 
were sent home.
“We’re just waiting,” 
Crow, 20, said.
Mike Mironack, the direc-
tor of operations at the Reitz 
Union, said the power outage was caused by a major circuit 
breaker that went out in the 
food court. It took the mainte-nance team at the Reitz Union a few tries to get the power back on because they were dealing with a large, high-power panel.
“It gave us a little bit of 
trouble, but we got it back on,” he said.
Panda Express and Crou-
tons had their power restored 
just before 11 a.m. The Star-
bucks bakery case and oven light turned back on at 11:02 a.m., and the soothing eleva-tor music sounded again.
Crow then lifted the gates 
and filled orders for two men who got in line as soon as she 
went behind the counter. 
As she was brewing cof-
fee and bagging a pastry for 
a customer, a line of eight 
guests had already formed 
within 10 minutes.
She explained to custom-
ers that she couldn’t make any specialty drinks, but she 
could make any type of tea 
and brewed coffee and that they could get  pastries.

UF researchers have found a pro-
gram focused on promoting anti-
substance abuse among teens and pre-teens to be successful.
Health Rocks! is a program run 
by the UF Institute of Food and Agri-cultural Sciences’ Florida 4-H Youth Development Program. It began in 2009 to teach alcohol and drug abuse prevention to students. 
Kate Fogarty, an associate profes-
sor in UF/IFAS’ family, youth and community sciences and a study co-author, helped lead the study about 
the program for students between 
the ages of 10 to 15. 
“I expect that kids, by learning 
hands-on, are making a difference in some way in their communities,” Fogarty said.More than 2,000 students in seven 
Florida counties participated in the program, said Muthusami Kuma-
ran, a UF assistant professor in fam-
ily, youth and community sciences who helped conduct the study. 
Students who participated in at 
least 10 hours of Health Rocks! took the survey that evaluated the effec-tiveness of the program, Kumaran said.
The survey asked students to an-
wer questions using a scale of 1 to 5, with one meaning strongly disagree and five meaning strongly agree.The average scores for Florida 
students went up in each of the three areas surveyed. In “drug knowl-edge,” scores rose from 2.99 to 3.43; in “drug beliefs/attitudes,” scores went from 3.45 to 3.63; and “skills to handle/resist drugs” improved 
from 3.0 to 3.43.
The average scores show statis-
tically significant improvement for 
hundreds of children in the program from 2009 to 2012, Fogarty said. 
UF/IFAS received a four-year, 
$160,000 grant from the National 4-H Council to support Health Rocks! 
“It’s so sad to see the numbers 
that (show) nearly a quarter of our children get hooked onto these habits at an early age at the middle school level,” Kumaran said.
 “It is just not right to let our chil-
dren fall through the cracks.” Substance abuse program successful

UF’s Department of Occupational 
Therapy will offer CarFit, a free and 
national program designed to help drivers fit safely and securely in their vehicles.
Linda Struckmeyer, an occupa-
tional therapy clinical lecturer, said UF has hosted the program for the past seven years. 
“Our goal is to reach out to ma-
ture drivers and to fit them in their cars safely and comfortably,” she said.
About 46 UF occupational therapy 
students will volunteer at the event Thursday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Senior Recreation Center at 5701 NW 34th St.
Annie Elinch, an occupational 
therapy graduate student, said the volunteers must complete some on-
line training before being authorized 
to help at CarFit.When the drivers come in, they 
will have to fill out paperwork and answer general questions about their car.
The students 
will then lead the 
drivers through a 12-point checklist with their vehicles, which will take about 20 minutes per driver. 
The students 
often recommend 
personal vehicle adaptations, such 
as adjusting the driver’s seat belt so 
it is sitting on their shoulders, rather than pulling on their shoulder mus-cles. 
The volunteers don’t actually 
make the changes, but they offer community resources and names of products that could make personal vehicles “fit” better and enhance the 
safety of drivers as a personal ser-
vice.Although most of the drivers who 
come to the event are elderly, Elinch said the event is for all ages.
“When I went through the check, 
my air bag was facing my face instead of my chest,” Elinch said. “(CarFit) is 
certainly beneficial for all ages.”
At the end of the checklist, driv-
ers are given gift bags containing a 
first-aid kit, magnets, pins and air fresheners.
National sponsors for the event 
include the American Society on Ag-ing, AAA, AARP and the American Occupational Therapy Association.
Molly Thompson, a UF nutrition 
junior, said she feels at ease knowing this program is helping elderly driv-ers, as her grandmother has trouble feeling secure in her car.
“Not only is this program helping 
mature drivers feel comfortable and safe while driving, it is saving lives and preventing future accidents from 
happening,” Thompson, 20, said.
said he turned in his application in late October to 
meet the early deadline.
“Honestly, the application took forever, and it 
was pretty demanding,” he said. “I know to get in is a pretty big deal, and there’s thousands of appli-cants, so it’s very important. I really think being a part of The Gator Nation would be awesome.”
Brandon Huynh, a 17-year-old senior at Braden 
River High School in Bradenton, Florida, said he turned in his application two weeks before the deadline. He also applied to Florida State Univer-sity, University of Central Florida and University of 
South Florida but hopes to be accepted by UF.
“My initial thought in turning in my application 
was that I was very nervous,” he said. “It’s the first 
college application I’ve sent in.”4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 2014

Erin Rawls is planning to bring 
her Walt Disney World poncho to 
graduation.
With the Stephen C. O’Connell 
Center undergoing construction fol-
lowing basketball season, graduat-
ing students will accept their diplo-mas in the Ben Hill Griffin Stadium this Spring.
As of now, four commencement 
ceremonies are planned for the stadi-um in the Spring, UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes wrote in an email. Each one will be at 7 p.m. from Thursday, April 30 until Sunday, May 3.
“These ceremonies will occur 
rain or shine just like football games 
but could be cancelled for serious 
weather conditions such as lighten-ing,” Sikes said.
Rawls, a psychology and zoology 
senior, said it will be a great change as long as it doesn’t rain.
“I think it’s really cool that it’s go-
ing to be in the stadium,” Rawls, 22, said. “It’s going to be outdoors, and 
The Swamp is just awesome, and it’s 
really pretty there.”
Yet she said she’s not happy with 
the entire College of Liberal Arts and Sciences graduating together in 
one ceremony — usually the college 
is split in two.
“It’s going to take forever,” she 
said. “We’re going to be in there for hours and hours.”
Some colleges may also host 
graduation ceremonies elsewhere, Sikes said. The colleges making plans to use the Phillips Center for 
the Performing Arts for at least one 
ceremony are: design, construction and planning, engineering, nursing, dentistry, law, medicine, pharmacy, and veterinary medicine.
“Plans are still being finalized 
and will be posted on the com-mencement website in coming weeks,” Sikes said.
If students wear ponchos as Rawls suggested, they would be 
covering up the new sustainable 
gowns, which is another change in the graduation lineup.
Herff Jones will be the new cap 
and gown distributor, said UF Book-
stores director Lynne Vaughan. The 
company is offering package deals for students to buy gowns, rings, an-nouncements and other accessories together.
“We were looking for someone to 
put everything together,” Vaughan said.Students would keep the gowns, 
which are made out of recycled ma-terials. More than 7,000 gowns are usually shipped among the distribu-tor, dry cleaner and UF, so this will cut labor and costs, Vaughan said.
“They’re also a hassle for stu-
dents to return,” she said. “We hear it every time.”
Herff Jones is keeping the price 
of gowns the same as in past years. Vaughan said the bookstore is look-ing to add Gator details to make bachelor’s and master’s gradu-ates stand out, as well as non-black gowns for doctoral students.
“We just knew when we saw 
them,” Vaughan said. “They repre-sent the university well.”

And The Polls Are Open 
Students cast their votes in the Career Resource Center in the Reitz Union around 11 a.m. Tuesday. 
The Reitz Union served as the polling place for voters who live in Precinct 31, which covers most of the central area of the UF campus.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — Republi-
cans claimed the Senate majority 
Tuesday for the first time in eight years, riding President Barack Obama’s unpopularity to victories 
in every part of the country.
Republican challengers ousted 
Democratic senators in Arkansas, 
Colorado and North Carolina, and took seats from retiring Democrats in four other states. Equally impor-tant, Republicans held off spirited challengers in Kentucky, Georgia and Kansas, guaranteeing they 
will control Congress for Obama’s 
last two years in office.
In every contested race, Repub-
licans tied their opponents to the president, whose fortunes have sagged since his re-election two years ago. Democrats awkwardly tried to distance themselves from Obama without denouncing him.Sen. Mitch McConnell of Ken-
tucky, who won a sixth term Tues-day, was almost assured of being elected by his colleagues as major-ity leader, a lifelong dream. His party can send piles of legislation to Obama’s desk — for his signa-ture or veto.
The final Senate partisan break-
down won’t be known until Dec. 6, when Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana will face Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy in a runoff. But the GOP’s majority was assured, regardless who wins there.
A GOP-run Senate will be an 
obvious aggravation to Obama and 
congressional Democrats, but it’s 
unclear how much it will change the government. Obama can veto bills, and Senate Democrats can use the filibuster to thwart scores of GOP initiatives, just as Republi-cans did to Democrats for years.GOP wins Senate control,

Tuesday night’s UF Student Senate meeting 
teemed with debate about the election code revi-
sions and funding for digital subscriptions of The New York Times for students.
Sen. Preston Jones objected to the final approval 
of Election Code 730, which would require any write-in candidate to submit an email to the su-pervisor of elections confirming his or her intent to seek office.
“I think it creates barriers for student involve-
ment in Student Government,” Jones said.
Sen. Anthony Sorrentino disagreed, saying the 
revision supports SG elections.
The bill passed with just one objection.
Sen. Paul Stevenson voiced concern during the second reading of The New York Times Reserve 
Transfer bill. He asked why students had access to the subscriptions before a second reading was ap-proved. Subscriptions were made available to stu-dents Oct. 29.
UF Senate President Joseph Michaels said no 
money from the SG Reserves was used for the sub-scriptions currently available to students. The first six months of the subscriptions were paid for by the 
UF Office of the Provost, and SG would pay for the 
other half — about $40,000 — of the subscriptions after the second reading has been approved. Year-long subscriptions cost $80,000.
The bill was unanimously approved.The Senate also passed two other allocations 
bills unanimously: $856.94 was granted to Humans versus Zombies, and Red Cross Gators received $504.47 to teach students fire and disaster safety. WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

The streets of downtown Gainesville will 
undergo a cultural explosion Saturday and 
Sunday. 
From 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., the public is invit-
ed to see, hear and taste different parts of the 
globe at the 33rd annual Downtown Festival 
& Art Show. Hosted by the Department of Parks, Recre-
ation and Cultural Affairs, the event will host about 250 artists from across the country and will likely attract more than 100,000 people, 
said Bill Hutchinson, the festival entertain-
ment coordinator. 
“People are going to have the time of their 
lives celebrating the arts with all of their friends in perfect weather,” Hutchinson said. 
He said people can expect a combination of art, food and music including brass bands, jazz and rock ‘n’ roll. 
The festival will be staffed with volunteers 
who were recruited well in advance, Hutchin-son said. 
“We create a space where our artists and 
musicians feel welcomed and the city is shown to its best advantage,” he said. 
O’Reilly & Co. will be taking one of the 
three stages at the festival. The family group has been playing Irish folk music for almost 20 years. The group’s frontman, John Johnson, said listeners can expect a lot of vocals and Irish-inspired melodies Sunday afternoon. 
“We are more of a singing band than in-
strumental,” he said. 
Tom Blake, a bartender at Lillian’s Music 
Store, said the festival works well with local 
businesses.  
“It’s a bunch of people downtown,” Blake 
said.
He said it increases foot traffic at the bar, as 
well as other restaurants in the area. 
Blake recalled when the festival was sig-
nificantly smaller. Now, it brings thousands of 
customers through the door.33rd annual Downtown Festival & Art Show starts Saturday

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ORLANDO — Incumbent Re-
publican Gov. Rick Scott won 
re-election Tuesday, despite a 
majority of Florida voters hav-ing an unfavorable view of him, buoyed by white voters and resi-dents in rural and suburban areas, according to the results of exit polling conducted for The Associ-ated Press and the television net-works.
More voters disapprove than 
approve of how Scott responded to health care reform, the polling 
showed. Overall, Florida voters expressed worry about the econ-
omy and a little less than two-thirds of voters believe the nation is on the wrong track.
Here are some highlights of 
voters’ views:
WHO LIKED SCOTT: White 
voters and senior citizens over-whelmingly supported Scott; both 
groups gave Scott around 55 per-
cent of their vote. Voters without a college degree favored Scott over Crist, as did voters earning more than $100,000 a year. 
WHO LIKED CRIST: Crist 
appealed to blacks, Hispanics, moderates and younger voters. Around 85 percent of African-Americans supported Crist over Scott, and Crist’s support among Hispanics was nearly 20 points higher than it was for Scott. Crist 
also appealed to voters under 40, 
and also moderate voters.
MEDICAL MARIJUANA: 
Though it failed to secure the nec-essary 60 percent for passage, the medical marijuana amendment won majority support among vot-ers from all racial and ethnic back-grounds, income levels and edu-
cational attainment. Only senior 
citizens and Republicans opposed legalizing medical marijuana. Exit poll: mixed feelings on Scott, Crist 
“Having applying students 
manually entering their 
grades leaves room for error 
and dishonesty.”

Florida, national 
trends a letdown
On Tuesday, Americans went to the polls and voted to 
give Republicans control of the U.S. Senate. Although many of the races were very close, it was clear toward 
the end that Republicans had earned a decisive victory at the national level.
In Florida, the voting results were largely a mixed bag. In 
some cases, voters made thoughtful, critical decisions about the future of our state. However, on the most important issues, vot-ers chose to send the Sunshine State down a dark path.
Florida voters made the correct choice on Amendments 1 
and 3. The former ensures a permanent source of funding for en-vironmental conservation that will not be subject to the whims of the Legislature or the governor. By rejecting the latter, voters prevented a needless change that would have given lame-duck 
governors more power over the state’s judicial system.
However, voters’ rejection of Amendment 2, which would 
have legalized medical marijuana in the Sunshine State, is deep-
ly unfortunate. The amendment was narrowly tailored to mini-mize abuse and ensured that those truly in need of medical re-lief would receive aid. Unfortunately, the makeup of the Florida Legislature suggests that medical marijuana legalization will not happen in the near future.
The most signiﬁ  cant — and likely most harmful — decision 
Florida voters made Tuesday was to re-elect incumbent Repub-lican Gov. Rick Scott. Despite Scott’s ghastly approval rating — which Public Policy Polling recently found to be at 39 percent — he was still able to pull out a razor-thin victory over Democratic challenger Charlie Crist.
Democrats can largely blame themselves for their loss in the 
governor’s race. Scott was one of the most unpopular politicians in the country and ripe for defeat. Rather than nominating a dy-namic candidate, Democrats settled on a familiar but fairly un-
inspiring nominee in Crist, a Republican-turned-Independent-
turned-Democrat.
Crist struggled to reconcile his previous political afﬁ  liations 
with his new, more liberal positions. In the end, the governor’s race became a choice between a ﬂ  ip-ﬂ  opper and an incumbent with a disastrous track record. In the end, Florida voters chose the latter.
Although neither candidate in the governor’s race was an 
ideal choice, there is little doubt that Crist would have been a 
stronger choice for Florida’s economy, environment and educa-
tion system. With Scott’s re-election, the outlook on these critical issues is more dire than ever before.
By re-electing Scott, Florida voters have decided the state’s 
future over the next four years: a low-functioning public school system, more sharp cuts to environmental and infrastructure spending and limited job growth in mostly low-wage sectors.
With large, supportive majorities in the Republican Legisla-
ture, Scott is poised to enact his agenda with little resistance. If Scott’s ﬁ  rst term is any indication, Florida voters may experience buyer’s remorse in the very near future.Blame ‘yes’ campaign for failed Amend. 2  
By the time you read this column, Floridians will know that Amendment 2 — which would have legalized the use of medical marijuana in Florida — was rejected. 
The amendment would have required a 60 percent voter ap-proval to be enacted; it received about 57 percent. 
It’s not that Floridians are too conservative for medical 
marijuana; it’s simply that a disaster of epic proportions struck a campaign that needed to be perfect. 
Winning 60 percent of the vote on anything is a challenge. 
That’s nearly two-thirds voting ‘yes.’ When was the last time two-thirds of voters agreed on anything? However, support for medical marijuana — and marijuana legalization — across the country is changing rapidly, with some polls indicating that a majority of Americans support legalized marijuana. 
National support did not translate into enough votes for 
victory, and it boils down to the pro-legalization campaign in Florida. The Yes on 2 campaign spent far more time attack-ing the opposition than stressing any beneﬁ  ts from legalizing medical marijuana. 
The opposition campaign was funded largely by casino 
magnate Sheldon Adelson — who similarly bankrolled Republican presidential candidates in 2012 — but even his pocketbook didn’t guarantee a win for the opposition. It 
seems as if something larger was at play. 
The reason why Florida did not join the likes of 20-plus 
other states across the country has to do largely with the Yes 
on 2 campaign. The main benefactor and public face of the campaign is popular attorney John Morgan. Morgan has a compelling, familial reason why he supports medical mari-juana, but his gregarious personality and questionable cam-paign tactics may be the Yes on 2 campaign’s undoing. 
A great example is The Daily Beast article about Amend-
ment 2 published just one day before the election. It portrays Morgan as the outgoing man he is but simultaneously por-trays Morgan as vulgar, condescending and perhaps a bit out of touch with the state of the electorate. Even though Morgan is a known ﬁ  gure in Florida, his presence may ultimately do more harm than good, despite his best intentions. 
Morgan spent time debating ofﬁ  cials, combatting claims 
that his support for Amendment 2 had more to do with get-ting his friend Charlie Crist elected governor and authoring — or at least signing — emails that were occasionally bizarre, desperate or downright angry.
Additionally, the campaign 
spent enormous amounts of time combatting the opposition, rather than stressing why Floridians in need could beneﬁ  t from medical 
marijuana. Campaign emails seemed to focus an inordinate amount of time on a faceless opposition, asking for contri-butions to combat attacks, rather than educating or actually campaigning for Amendment 2. 
It almost seemed as if there were a schizophrenic mental-
ity behind the online messaging campaign. Based on emails and social media alone, one day it appeared that Amend-ment 2 was poised for a major victory come Election Day, but suddenly, the situation would appear dire, before recovering to once again proclaim victory. 
That’s not how you run a winning campaign, regardless 
of the issue.  A campaign might be a dumpster ﬁ  re on the in-side, but it must present a certain level of poise to the public 
in order to build conﬁ  dence. Issue campaigns require educa-
tion, especially when you need 60 percent of the vote to pass. From the strange, bipolar emails, to a campaign that became more about attacking the opposition, to Morgan’s giant per-sonality, the debate over Amendment 2 seemed to center on anything but the issue at hand. As a result, it’s unlikely Flo-ridians will have medical marijuana anytime soon. 
When you read about marijuana in a college newspaper, 
far too often, it’s a column pushing for legalization of mari-
juana, because how else can you listen to Phish, man? Re-
gardless of your views on marijuana, and even if you’re cur-rently clouded by a haze of pot smoke, we can all agree that if a state like Florida wants to legalize medical or recreational marijuana, campaigns need to make a stronger argument.
Perhaps it’ll take an epic loss for them to ﬁ  gure that out.Joel Mendelson is a UF graduate student in political cam-

With the extremely 
rapid growth of tech-nology throughout 
this century, my generation has been the ﬁ  rst to grow up com-
pletely surrounded by the new 
advances offered to humanity. Everyone has a smartphone, an Instagram and a Facebook ac-count. We Google everything from the plotline of a movie to the history of a catchphrase. We use hashtags, commu-nicate with people hundreds of miles away with a tap of our ﬁ  nger and take an extreme 
amount of selﬁ  es.
Our generation, the young 20-somethings 
either in college or striking boldly into the 
workforce, who move at a lightning-quick pace through everyday life and operate al-most exclusively in a heavily image-based so-cial culture, has been criticized by most of its older counterparts. We are said to be image obsessed, shallow and self-absorbed. I spoke 
with someone the other day who didn’t own 
a computer, and when I expressed some surprise at this fact, he became condescend-ing, explaining to me that “(my) generation barely knows how to read a book!”
Well, if that’s the case, I really don’t un-
derstand how we are all in college right now.
This sentiment about the millennial gen-
eration’s apathy with regard to books, and to reading in general, seems to be one that is widely shared by adults. To an extent, I can understand where they might get the no-tion. Bookstores such as Borders and Barnes & Noble are being downgraded and put out of business by big, technology-driven com-panies such as Amazon. It’s a lot more com-mon to see someone scrolling through their 
Twitter feed rather than ﬂ  ipping through a 
book while they ride the bus.
But these are individual instances that 
fail to look at the bigger picture and fail to 
see the way technology has actually helped my generation and future ones to read and absorb more about the world.
We take in information every 
day from so many sources: Ar-ticles popping up on our Face-book walls, information found 
from Google searches, online 
magazines and news websites that are a virtual melting pot of information and opinions from all over the world.
These technological sources we are sur-
rounded by every day do not keep the mil-lennial generation from connecting with other people; in fact, they do just the oppo-
site and encourage us to create connections 
and form informed perspectives on current world issues.
Every day, I read articles, reviews and 
commentaries on subjects that interest me, and many of them happen to be about books and reading.
For the people who love to read — and 
there will always be so many of us, the num-
bers growing each time someone ﬁ  nishes a 
book and says to themselves, “that changed me” — the rise of technology has facilitated an even wider range of channels through which to read and have discussions. The rise of technology has not given us a more self-centered outlook on life, but a more interconnected one, open to new ideas and inventions.
In a recent study conducted of the mil-
lennial generation and our reading habits, it was found that millennials are more likely to have read a book in the past 12 months than an older adult and are just as likely as an older adult to have been to a library.
Our generation has grown up using and 
adapting to the technology of this century as it evolves around us, and it has given us 
the ability to see and use the written word in 
brand new ways. This growth is something 
to be celebrated.

opinions@alligator.orgInternships — and the pres-
sure to land as many presti-gious ones as possible — are 
constantly on college students’ minds. However, in our quest 
to ﬁ  nd them, many of us settle for under-
paid or unpaid positions. I wonder how many of us ask ourselves if this is a morali-ty we want to implicitly endorse and a phe-nomenon in which we are content to take part in. Last summer, I took an internship in an effort to grow intellectually and add that precious line to my resume. Though I feel that I achieved both of those things, 
my experience taught me that “invaluable” 
internships impose a heavy price. In order to make myself seem attractive to future employers, I contributed to a corrupt prac-tice that upholds classist systems, disad-vantages many young people and afﬁ  rms corporate voraciousness. 
I understand why businesses, particu-
larly nonproﬁ  ts and small ﬁ  rms, hire un-
derpaid or unpaid interns. Often, these 
organizations do not have enough money to ﬁ  nance an inexperienced worker. How-ever, it is important to recognize the soci-etal implications of such a practice. Unpaid internships undeniably shrink the appli-cant pool to those who likely beneﬁ  t from privileged positions: namely, people who can afford to ﬁ  nance themselves and those 
who go to an elite school that can provide 
internship funding. If businesses require in-ternships to get desirable jobs, and if those internships are only available to privileged classes, “equality of opportunity/access” becomes devoid of any practical meaning. 
By participating in this system as an un-
paid intern, I was complicit in a scheme that requires young people with no bargaining 
power to subsidize corporations, exploits la-
bor by pretending that it is not valued as is, exacerbates the income gap, disadvantages lower socioeconomic classes and limits the workforce’s accessibility to the privileged. Though I do not entirely blame myself or the company for which I interned, the setup itself is corrupt, and both companies and interns should demand change. 
A possible objection is that internships offer valuable training that could not be taught in the classroom. Perhaps this is fair. As a proponent of a liberal arts education (as opposed to tech-
nical schools), I do not think it is the place of higher education to prepare students for work in a particular ﬁ  eld. However, I do expect employers to recognize the cogni-tive skills that higher education instills. The fact that many jobs require a bachelor’s de-gree is evidence that many employers place stock in college education, and it is not un-reasonable to ask them to act on that faith. 
Cognitive skills also allow for on-the-job 
training that could blend productive work and job-speciﬁ  c training. If Target pays its employees for training, so should other or-ganizations. 
Further, it is irrelevant that ﬁ  elds that 
typically institute internships are more “prestigious” ones like journalism and gov-ernment work — exploitation is exploita-
tion, whether the person being exploited 
is a child in a textile mill in the 1900s or a 20-something in a startup today. If the la-bor contract is not free from undue coercion and the two parties do not have roughly equal bargaining power, then it is not a just system. 
Interns might be “indispensable” for 
businesses, but that should not be our only 
consideration in thinking about the moral-
ity of our current internship culture. Un-paid internships only help free-riding busi-nesses and the elites that can afford to take them. Companies place the burden on us as young people and on our colleges, and we should not be willing to carry it. 
Though I understand the tricky place 
the college plays in this struggle, I ask ad-
ministrators and students alike to demand 
more from prospective employers. A price cannot be put on respect and value, but demanding free labor from those who are not free to make an actual choice reduces the dignity of work and exploits the power-less.

Others were less convinced.Kevin Nader, a 21-year-old UF econom-
ics senior, said the election was a close call because neither candidate was ideal, he 
said.
“In all honesty, it’s kind of the lesser of 
two evils between these two guys,” Nader 
said. “Rick Scott hasn’t proved to be the 
best choice, but compared to Charlie Crist, 
it’s a pretty easy choice.”

Downtown, Democratic Party members 
huddled close at Tall Paul’s for an election-
night watch party, their foreheads slicked 
with sweat as Bob Dylan’s “Like a Rolling Stone” buzzed in the background.
Democratic state representative can-
didate Jon Uman thanked his campaign members as his numbers dropped behind 
Republican Keith Perry’s, ultimately lead-
ing to his loss. 
“We’ve been working on this 20 hours a 
day, seven days a week for months,” Uman 
said in the warm, packed room with Amer-
ican ﬂ  ags and campaign signs lining the 
walls. “We are ﬁ  ghting for public schools, 
for the environment and the working fam-ily.”
As the crowds grew thicker and the ten-
sion stronger, Uman spoke of lowering tu-ition costs and expanding women’s rights.
“The ﬁ  ght isn’t over.”
After Democratic congressional repre-
sentative candidate Marihelen Wheeler of District 3 lost to Republican Ted Yoho, she 
stood in front of the crowd with her arms crossed over her red sweater.
“This has been a great year,” she said as 
camera lights ﬂ  ashed.
“We sing with the choir,” Wheeler said. 
“I’m singing with you. I’m not preaching 
to you.”
Supporters like Jackie Betz applauded. 
The 67-year-old spent eight hours on the 
side of the road waving signs for Ken Cor-nell, who won the District 4 County Com-missioner seat with 57 percent of the vote.
As a Democratic Party volunteer, Betz 
said she has driven people to voting pre-cincts, worked fundraisers and went door-
to-door for the past few weeks.
“My legs are rubbery,” she said.Betz, who owns a farm in Alachua 
County, said she’s seen burrowing owls 
get run over by trucks and gopher tor-toises’ holes covered up from deforestation 
near her home. Her main concern in this 
election was conserving Alachua County’s land and forests.
“This is where I came to retire,” she 
said. “I love this county and want to do ev-
erything I can to preserve it.”
As Betz stared at the screen displaying 
the results of a few Democratic candidates, 
disappointment plagued her face. She said 
more people needed to vote.
“People aren’t dumb,” she said. “People 
know who they want to support.”
Cornell’s victory over John Martin 
named him the replacement for Republi-
can commissioner Susan Baird, who de-
cided not to run for re-election.
“This is not our campaign,” Cornell said 
to the crowd. “This is the people’s cam-
paign.”
The UF alumnus aims to preserve natu-
ral resources and explore sustainable en-
ergy options.
“This has been wonderful because it has 
been driven by the people of our county,” 
he said as his numbers crept close to Re-
publican John Martin’s at about 8:30 p.m. Once his victory was declared shortly after 
9 p.m., Cornell gave a heartfelt speech.
“Tonight we celebrate, but tomorrow 
we get back to work,” he said.
When asked what his ﬁ  rst goal as Coun-
ty Commissioner is, he said he wants to take his wife “out of Alachua County and 
give her a break for a few days.”
Just after Cornell left the stage, the 
crowd quickly thinned out. Others waited at the bar, sipping craft beers and red wine while waiting for the governor results to roll in.
■   ■   ■With nearly 50 percent of Alachua 
County voters turning out for the polls, Su-pervisor of Elections Pam Carpenter said Tuesday went smoothly.
“What we’re hearing is that everyone 
was steady and busy all day,” she said at 
about 9 p.m.
Though turnout was high, Carpenter 
said it was still on target for local election 
numbers, which typically range anywhere 
from 45 to 50 percent.
And though Amendment 2 received 
66.1 percent of Alachua County votes, the measure that would have made medical 
marijuana legal was defeated statewide as 
it fell about 2 percentage points short of the 
60 percent needed to pass. 
Amendment 1 passed, which will in-
crease conservation funding without in-
creasing taxes, while Amendment 3 did 
not, preventing outgoing governors from appointing state Supreme Court justices.
Back at the Swamp, president of Alach-
ua County Young Republicans Katy Mel-chiorre said they always knew it was going 
to be close.
The second-year UF law student said 
the group had been busy making phone 
calls and encouraging eligible voters to cast their ballots throughout the day.
At about 9:10 p.m., Melchiorre read out 
the difference in votes for Scott in Alachua 
County between 2010 and this year.
“2010 Scott lost Alachua County by 
15,804 votes,” she said while reading from 
her iPhone to a table of fellow party mem-bers. “2014 lost Alachua by only 12,846 — 
that is a hell of an improvement!”
The crowd cheered back.
The celebration will continue today, 
when president of UF College Republicans Kailyn Allen said members will be riding 
on a party bus to commemorate the vic-
tory.
“We are really glad that our hard work 
has paid off,” Melchiorre, 23, said. “Espe-cially in such a liberal area.”

Hargreaves named Bednarik Award semiﬁ  nalist
UF cornerback Vernon Hargreaves III was named a

Marcus Mariota is at the 
front of the pack in the latest alligatorSports Heisman Ballot. See the full results on Page 14.◗ HIS SON, KELVIN TAYLOR, RUSHED FOR A CAREER-HIGH 197 YARDS AGAINST GEORGIA.
JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writer @J_McPherson1126
Fred Taylor watched his son struggle this 
season.
Kelvin Taylor — the prodigy of Florida’s 
fourth-leading rusher in program history — 
has not started the season the way he wanted to.
The sophomore running back’s numbers 
have been in a decline one year after starting four of the Gators’ ﬁ  nal ﬁ  ve contests and be-ing named to the Southeastern Conference All-Freshman team.
Heading into Florida’s annual meeting 
with Georgia in Jacksonville last Saturday, Taylor was coming off a four-game stint where he accumulated just 68 rushing yards.
“I constantly stay in Kelvin’s ear about be-
ing patient,” Fred said in a phone interview on Tuesday. “I tell him, you know, ‘You’re in college. Things happen. You’re young.’ … He’s a good kid. He listens. We just hope he keeps growing and maturing.”
But despite the lack of carries, despite the 
lack of playing time, Florida’s sophomore running back was never deterred.
“I’ve just been going to practice with the 
same mentality to just keep working hard and I know everything else will fall in place,” Kelvin said Wednesday prior to the game. 
Megan Reeves / Alligator Staff
Kelvin Taylor celebrates during Florida’s 38-20 win against Georgia on Saturday at EverBank Field in Jacksonville. After strug-gling to see playing time earlier in the season, Taylor rushed for a career-high 197 yards against the Bulldogs.
OTERO’S OPNION
Florida volley-
ball’s conference play is dying 
down and while that means the postseason is approaching, it also means that Southeast-ern Conference honors are right around the corner.
So with that said, I am grac-
ing the volleyball world with my 
picks for SEC Player of the Year, 
SEC Freshman of the Year, SEC Libero of the Year and, of course, SEC Coach of the Year.
 SEC Player of the Year — 
Krystal Rivers, Alabama
Rivers has a story that is heart 
wrenching and proves the re-
silience of human beings. After 
being diagnosed and battling Hodgkins lymphoma — a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes — in Janu-ary, she returned to Alabama as a redshirt 
sophomore and has 
excelled this season. 
So far, she leads 
the Alabama squad in 
kills per set (4.19) and 
service aces (32). She’s 
37th in the NCAA and second in the SEC for kills per set. 
Offensively, Rivers is a pow-
erhouse. Between her amazing recovery and kicking ass on the court, she’s deﬁ  nitely my pick for SEC player of the year.
SEC Freshman of the Year — 
Rhamat Alhassan, Florida 
There isn’t a freshman that 
stands out in the SEC the way Alhassan does. So far this season, she leads Florida with a .466 hit-
ting percentage (good enough for 
second in the nation) and 1.36 blocks per set. The 6-foot-4 freshman has re-
ceived ﬁ  ve player-of-the-week type awards so far this season. 
Basically, she’s gone from volley-
ball newcomer to most scouted player on Florida’s roster and it’s not for nothing.
SEC Libero of the Year — 
Holly Pole, Florida 
Pole is technically new to the 
libero position since she just took over this year for fellow team-
mate Taylor Unroe. 
But let’s get this straight. Pole 
is a beast in the libero position. So 
much so, that coach Mary Wise 
continues to credit the backline 
for Florida’s offensive success, which has been the talk of the team this season. 
On Monday, Pole was honored 
as the SEC defensive player of the 
week after helping rout Tennes- Predicting the SEC volleyball honors

tains his team is not having issues with chemistry, he said on Tuesday that the loss of four starting seniors has cre-ated a void and a bit of confu-sion with the young and new players.
“When they look at the fact 
that we lost four seniors that kinda had a lot of experience, they look at it from the stand-point of what do I need to do to replace that stuff? We don’t need that right now. We really don’t. That happened last year organically,” Donovan said. “They just need to be con-nected where, I say this all the 
time, when you get in the huddle 
and have this feeling of ‘I don’t want to let down the guy next 
to me.’ They’re not at that place.”
The Gators don’t have too 
long to get to that place. 
Florida will host Barry Uni-
versity on Thursday at 7 p.m. for their ﬁ  rst exhibition game Gators work on

MORGAN MORIARTY
Alligator Staff Writer @Morgan_Moriarty
AlligatorSports casted its third 
round of Heisman ballots on Tuesday. 
Here are the results.
1.) Marcus Mariota, quarter-
back, Oregon
Why He’s Here: In his third 
season at Oregon, Marcus Mari-ota has proved why he’s one of the best quarterbacks in the country. He has completed 68 percent of his passes and is averaging 10 yards per attempt in the air. He’s also tied for third in the country in passing touchdowns. And he doesn’t turn 
the ball over either. His ﬁ  rst inter-
ception on the season came against Cal in Week 9. Last week, he beat Stanford for the ﬁ  rst time in his career. He accounted for two pass-ing and two rushing touchdowns against the Cardinal defense, which is ranked sixth in the country. 
What Lies Ahead: The Ducks 
travel on the road to No. 17 Utah this week, followed by games against Colorado and a road game against Oregon State. He’ll get a chance to solidify his name on the Heisman ballot during the Pac-12 Championship game, where he’ll likely face either the Arizona State Sun Devils or the USC Trojans. 
2.) Dak Prescott, quarterback, 
Mississippi State Why He’s Here: Dak Prescott 
is a big reason why the Mississippi State Bulldogs are the No. 1 ranked team in the country. He has account-ed for more than 2,000 yards in the air along with 16 touchdowns, and 
he’s second on the team in rushing 
averaging 5.3 yards per carry, and has 10 touchdowns on the ground. He’s defeated three top-10 teams, including then-No. 8 LSU, then No.-6 Texas A&M and current No. 3 Auburn.
What Lies Ahead: Prescott and 
the Bulldogs have one of the tough-
est roads ahead, including road 
tests against No. 5 Alabama and No. 11 Ole Miss in Oxford. Both of those schools have defenses that rank inside the top 20 teams in the country. 
3.) Melvin Gordon, running 
back, Wisconsin
Why He’s Here: Wisconsin run-
ning back Melvin Gordon is a big reason why the Badgers have just one loss in the Big Ten. He is third in the country in rushing yards per game, averaging about 162 each week. He’s also putting up those numbers by not taking as many car-ries as you’d expect — his most car-ries was in week four against South 
Florida, where he had 32 carries 
for 181 yards. The Badgers prob-ably would have beaten LSU in the opening week had it not been for Gordon being benched in the fourth quarter due to injury. 
What Lies Ahead: Gordon did 
not ﬁ  nish last week’s game against Rutgers after hurt his knee, but Coach Gary Anderson expects him 
to be 100 percent for this week’s 
game against Purdue. Wisconsin’s next big test is against No. 13 Ne-braska in a couple of weeks. A win over the Cornhuskers at home could improve their odds to represent the West in the Big Ten Championship game. 
4.) Amari Cooper, wide receiv-
er, Alabama
Why He’s Here: Alabama’s Am-
ari Cooper has established himself as one of the most lethal wideouts 
in all of college football this season. 
His numbers are ridiculous, averag-ing 16 yards per reception and nine touchdowns. If that isn’t enough for you, consider this: Cooper ranks in the top four in every single receiving category in the country including receiving touchdowns, yards, yards per game and receptions per game. A receiver hasn’t won the Heisman since Michigan’s Desmond Howard did it in 1991. Cooper has certainly made the plays to be a legitimate 
contender this season. 
What Lies Ahead: Alabama 
has one of the more manageable 
schedules remaining, with home games against Mississippi State and Auburn looming in the month of November. This week they get a big test going on the road to No. 16 LSU, who has a pretty talented 
secondary.
5.) Everett Golson, quarterback, 
Notre Dame
Why He’s Here: Golson and 
No. 10 Notre Dame have just one 
loss, coming from Florida State which they lost in the last second. Golson is also a big reason Notre Dame won this past weekend on 
the road against Navy, leading the 
Irish to three touchdown drives in the fourth quarter to hold off Navy 49-39. Not to mention Golson has lost just two games as a starter in his entire collegiate career at Notre Dame.
What Lies Ahead: Notre Dame 
has just one ranked opponent re-
maining on its schedule — No. 9 
Arizona State this weekend, which means his numbers could increase and improve his Heisman chances.

of the 2014-15 season. 
Florida’s first official game of 
the season will be against William 
& Mary on Nov. 14. Donovan said 
he wants the team to communicate 
better on the court. 
“They’ve got to get more cohe-
sive in the fact that, like, Michael 
Frazier may be out there worry-ing about three or four other guys. 
He needs to worry about himself. 
Kasey Hill’s trying to lead, but he 
needs to worry about himself,” 
Donovan said. “And I think it all comes out and stems from a re-ally, really good place, but I think 
it needs to be more of myself doing 
that because there’s almost like too many voices.”
Donovan and the rest of his 
coaching staff have spent the last two weeks of practice doing some heavy coaching. So much so that even veteran players have been biting their tongues. Transfer cen-ter Jon Horford said he “absolute-ly” has felt the need to hold back a bit during huddles in the first few weeks of practice.
“Coach is big right now on al-
lowing the coaches to coach,” Hor-ford said. “If we see something that’s glaring, yeah, point it out. 
But mostly just get in there, play 
and allow them to direct.”
With about four years of expe-
rience from his time at Michigan, Horford has wisdom to contribute as a team and huddle leader but for now he said he’s fine taking a more silent role and teaching by example.
“What we do sets an example 
for younger players. If we’re not doing our jobs, that’s not a very good example for them,” Horford said. “We have to make sure we’re doing what we know and it’s the right thing to do at all times.”
see 3-0. 
Pole is leading the defense 
with 3.55 digs per set, and Wise 
said that Pole goes beyond the 
stats on the paper, digging and 
receiving 90- to 95- percent of the balls that come into her vicinity. 
SEC Coach of the Year — 
Mary Wise
You can’t be surprised by 
this. Wise is literally the win-ningest coach in the SEC, if not the NCAA. 
She’s the only coach left in the 
SEC that’s undefeated in confer-ence play and has managed to recruit one of the deepest and 
strongest classes that Florida has 
seen in a long time. 
To say Wise deserves Coach 
of the Year is an understatement. She pretty much deserves Coach 
of the Century, as Spurs coach 
Gregg Popovich would say.“I’m just ready to go.”
When Saturday came, Kel-
vin was indeed ready.
He rushed for a career-
high 197 yards and two touch-
downs on just 25 carries as the 
Gators piled on 418 total yards 
on the ground and defeated 
the Bulldogs for the first time since 2010.
“I think what’s special, 
what made me feel great, was 
how he persevered through all 
the frustrations this season of wanting to play more,” Fred said. 
“So to see the outcome and 
what he, Matt (Jones), the of-fensive line, the whole entire offensive unit with that dis-play that they put on in that 
fashion against that team — a 
team who thinks they’re tough 
— they were able to just man-handle them. 
“Seeing them running the 
ball in that fashion, just smash 
mouth, that’s what had me on 
Cloud 9. It made it a great feel-
ing to wake up as a Gator the 
next day.”
Even though the Gators 
have seen their struggles in 
recent time — highlighted by 
a seven-game losing streak to 
end the 2013 season— Fred 
said he still likes the direction the program is heading under fourth-year head coach Will Muschamp.
“I think Will has been solid 
in a sense that he’s helping build and develop young men 
and that’s what you want,” he 
said. “College is all about the 
experience and the opportuni-
ty. Those scholarships, they’re priceless. The free education, 
that’s priceless. And you have 
to work for it. It doesn’t come 
easy.”
But while Fred is in support 
of Muschamp, he understands 
why Muschamp is under scru-tiny.
“I think that he’s going to be 
judged like every other coach,” Fred said. 
“He’s going to be judged 
on his success and that is de-
termined in sports by winning. 
And it hasn’t been pretty for him. So quite naturally, he’s 
been under some fire.”
With the season coming to a 
close and the Gators still in con-
tention for the SEC East crown, Fred said Florida should not 
count itself out just yet.
“That would be the ulti-
mate surprise,” he said. “But 
I think they have found their identity if they continue to do 
what they did a week ago. If 
that’s their identity going for-
ward, and if they can sustain 
that, they’re going to be tough to reckon with because the de-fense has been playing solid all 
season.”Taylor likes Will

After almost a week off since its 
regular season ﬁ  nale, No. 2 seed 
Florida (14-4, 9-2 Southeastern Con-ference) plays 10th-seeded Tennes-see today at 1 p.m. in Orange Beach, Alabama, in what it hopes to be the start of a long run in the SEC Tour-nament.
The lengthy layoff has made the 
team anxious to get back on the ﬁ  eld and play again. The excitement was evident among the players before their departure for Alabama.
Even the prospect of potentially playing three games in ﬁ  ve days — something the Gators would have to do if they advanced to the champi-onship game on Sunday — sounded 
fun to the soccer-starved unit.
“It’s tiring, but I think all of us 
love soccer so much that we’re super 
excited to play more games,” senior Tessa Andujar said.
Coach Becky Burleigh echoed 
Andujar’s sentiments.
“For our team, you realize the 
fragility left in your season, and so I 
think it’s an exciting opportunity for 
us, it’s exciting to have more games to play,” she said. “This team has always wanted to spend as much time as possible together, so I think they’re just excited about getting back on the ﬁ  eld.”
The matchup between Florida 
and Tennessee is their second in the last 13 days — the Gators beat the Volunteers 3-1 on senior night in Gainesville on Oct. 24. 
In the match, Tennessee jumped 
ahead early in the opening minutes and held the lead until the half, but Florida came roaring back in the second half. Burleigh called it one 
of Florida’s most complete perfor-
mances of the season.
Tennessee earned the right to 
play Florida after a come-from-be-hind victory against Alabama Mon-day, in which the Volunteers scored three second-half goals to defeat the Crimson Tide 3-2.
Even though the Gators played 
well in their ﬁ  rst meeting, the team says it knows every match will be difﬁ  cult in the postseason.“No matter who we play, they’re 
going to be really good,” Andujar said, “and we just need to match that.”
And even though Florida nar-
rowly missed the No. 1 seed — fall-ing one point behind Texas A&M — Burleigh said the team still has a target on its back because of the program’s success, and it should ex-pect the best from every opponent it faces.
“I have a good feeling that peo-
ple like to beat Florida,” she said, “regardless if you’re the No. 1 or No. 2 seed.”

The UF men’s and women’s swimming 
and diving teams (M: 2-1, 2-1 Southeastern 
conference; W: 3-1, 3-1 SEC) lost their ﬁ  rst meets of the season Friday in Athens, Geor-gia, against the Bulldogs. 
But the good news is they don’t have 
to wait long to get back in the pool and re-bound from their initial losses. 
After the men’s and women’s teams lost 
to Georgia 174.5-122.5 and 176-119 respec-tively in their last meet, the Gators will swim again on Saturday against a deep Minnesota team (M: 3-1, 1-1 Big Ten Conference; W: 4-0, 2-0 Big Ten) in the O’Connell Center Nata-
torium. 
When UF faced UGA, the Bulldogs raced 
better overall throughout the meet, winning 
eight of the ﬁ  rst 
nine events. Flor-ida’s loss came to  Georgia men’s and 
women’s squads which are ranked fourth and second in the country. 
Coach Gregg Troy knew his teams had 
their work cut out for them in Athens, but the Gators committed too many mistakes against an the Bulldogs. 
“We had the opportunity to have a good 
competition on Friday ... swam a really good Georgia team,” Troy said. “We didn’t swim quite as well as what we would have liked but it gave us the opportunity to see what 
had happened in the two weeks prior. We 
had two great weeks of training. We are very pleased of how well the athletes responded race wise but we just made too many mis-takes. We had little things that held us back and we are just not gonna swim well like a team like Georgia and make those kind of mistakes. We just lost too many close rac-es.”
There were some bright spots for the 
Gators. Freshman Caeleb Dressel for the men and junior Natalie Hinds for the wom-en won both their respective sprint races, the 50-yard (Hinds 22.55 seconds, Dressel: 20.06) and 100-yard freestyle (Hinds: 49.37, Dressel: 44.35). Florida also lost a bunch of close races that could have gone the either way. 
But Troy said the race and the close 
loss was a good learning experience for its younger swimmers.
“All the men’s freestyle events, everyone 
of them were close. Tremendous races the whole way,” said Troy. “It’s good to have that opportunity this time of year. On the women’s side, we still have some injures and we’re not very deep. The women across 
the top swam real well, credit Natalie Hinds, 
how well she raced and even though Jessica Thielmann didn’t win, she raced tremen-dously tough. On the men’s Caeleb Dressel was fantastic in the short freestyle and all the other ones were close, we just didn’t win the close races.”
Gators looking to rebound from ﬁ  rst loss of season“It’s tiring, but I think all 
of us love soccer so much 
that we’re super excited to 
play more games.”
