better than anyone.
During his press conference Mon-
day, Meyer didn't try to lay out all the
reasons why the rivalry clash will be
one of the most emotional days Ben
Hill Griffin Stadium has ever hosted.
He didn't have to. He said it all
without saying a word-.
Three times, Meyer had to pause
mid-sentence to compose himself.

Day i 2005, the 2007 death of would-
be senior Michael Guilford and the

week."
It was the most emotion Meyer has
shown to the media during his tenure
in Gainesville -forgood reason.
At the end of this week, the win-
ningest class in Southeastern Con-
ference history will vanish from The
Swamp, taking with it some of the
best players the school has ever seen.

year despite being a consensus first-team All-American.lst performance to turn in for the
home crowd.
The Last Lap
Many words have been used to de-
scribe Tim Tebow, but underappreci-
ated isn't one of them.
Still, despite all the hype and acco-
lades, linebacker Ryan Stamper said
he didn't stop and really think about
the impact his quarterback has made
until recently.
"I was talking to (Brandon) Spikes,
(Dustin) Doe and the other lineback-
ers the other day, and we were just
saying that sometimes we take for
granted that we have one of the best
players in college footblon our
team," Stamper said.
"When you look back, you real-
ize how great of a player he is, all the
things he has done for this school and
a lot of things no one has done before.
You really appreciate having a guy
like that on your team."Saturday will give fans a chance
to express the same feeling, including
thanks for the work Tebow has done
off the field.
Fans are planning to wear eye-
black strips as a tribute to the reli-
gious messages Tebow has promoted
during his career, messages that have
carried over to the team.
Stamper credits Tebow's arrival
for the team's increased charity work,
and Meyer says it has resulted in a
changed mentality inside the locker
"The impact he has made, it's al-
most like selflessness is now a cool
thing," Meyer said. "It's like kids are
realizing to give back, and if you can
brighten someone's day, you do it.
The impact he has made on this team
and coaching staff is phenomenal. It's
very noticeable, behind closed doors
probably more than what you guys
see." ,.
Tebow's on-field impact is much
easier to see, with accolades on dis-
play inside the stadium and the ad-
joining Heavener Football Complex.
He'lltake his finallap around the field
to high-five fans on Saturday, andwhile it'll be a tough goodbye, Tebow
isn't ready to rule out a return to The
Swamp one day.
He said Meyer always jokes that
he'll eventually take over as the
Gators' coach,iand he admits the op-
portunity to be involved with football
and influence people would be an at-
tractive career.
"That is intriguing for me, and it's
not something I'm going to throw out
because I think I would have a lot of
fun doing it," Tebow said.
"That door will never be closed for
me.",
More Than a Supporting Cast
In all likelihood, Saturday's game
will be most remembered forbeing
Tebow's last, but his list of co-stars
warrants plenty of attention.
Spikes, who put a pro career on
hold to return for another year, will
leave the field for good, taking histrademark dreadlocks and knack for
big plays with him.
Electrifying return man Brandon
James will have his last chance to
dazzle the crowd with one of the long,
winding returns that have made him
UF's careerleader in just about every
kick return category.
Defensive end Jermaine Cunning-
ham will chase anopposing quarter-
back across Florida Field for the final
time. Receiver Riley Cooper will have
his last shot at hauling in a deep pass
from his roommate.
The list goes on, providing ample
evidence forthe talent of Meyer's 2006
recruiting class, which also included
NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year can-
didate Percy Harvin.
"That whole class, you just knew
we were going to win a lot of foot-
ball games because there were a lot of
great players," Stamper said. "It just
shows during the time they've been
here with how many wins we have."
The senior class amassed a record
of 46-6, going 27-5 in SEC play, 25-2 at
home and 11-1 againstrivals Tennes-
see, Georgia, FSU and Miami.
But there's more to the senior class
than its stars. Every player from thestarters to the practice squad has had
a hand in the program's success dur-
ing the past fouryears.
The contributions of scout team
players are often overlooked, but that
won't be the caseon Senior Day. Each
player will be recognized, includ-
ing Guilford, whose tragic death in a
motorcycle accident sent shockwaves
through the team in 2007.
"We'regoing toinvite his family
down," Meyer said. "He's a part of
this group. You take Mike out of this
process and that really stung this foot-
ball team.
"He has a terrific family, and we're
just trying to do the best we can to
make that family feel at peace with
what he did here. He was a phenom-
enal young man and a phenomenal
memberof this team."
Survivors
The 2006 recruiting class may be
Meyer's best, but there's something to
be said for his first class as well.
Stamper, receiver David Nelson,
kicker Jonathan Phillips and safety
Dorian Munroe are all that remain
of the 2005 class, but what they lack
in quantity has been made up for by
leadership, specifically from Stamper
and Nelson.
"Take Ryan Stamper out of that
[senior] class, and I can assureeyou
that record and these accomplish-
ments would not occur," Meyer said.
Stamper has been vital to the de-
fense's success this season, leading
the Gators with 64 tackles,iand though
Nelson hasn't had a major impacton
the offense, he's always praised for his
work ethiciand effect on teammates.
Neither player gets much glory -
nor do they seek it out. It's all part of
the gritty mindset that comes from
five years of perseverance.
"We pretty much stuck it out,"
Stamper said. "A lot of guys from my
class either got kicked off or trans-
ferred. We're the only survivors left,
so that's a big accomplishment for
us."
And beyond the end of this season,
they have one more task to accom-plish: toeencourage the next crop of
players to stick it out too.
Meyer said he has sevenNFL-ready
juniors on the team, meaning Senior
Day could be the last home game for a
host of other players as well.
Cornerback Joe Haden and defen-
sive end Carlos Dunlap are consid-
ered first-round prospects, and tight
end Aaron Hernandez, safety Major
Wright, linemen Carl Johnson and
Mike and Maurkice Pouncey will all
have to make decisions on their fu-tures after the season.
With such an emotional day in
store, a fairytale ending is almost ex-
pected,leavingthe Seminoles chance
to rain on the parade.
The Gators have takenifive straight
against FSU, winning the last two by
comfortable margins, and the thought
of that streak ending on his last ap-
pearance in The Swamp is enough to
turn Stamper's tone dark.
"I don't even want to think about
that," he said. "That would be a bad,
bad day around here.That would be
bad."

Students had one mission in mind Tuesday
as they lined up on the Reitz Union North Lawn:
to get a free Nike T-shirt.
Nike gave away about 15 T-shirts with the
slogan "Finish the Mission" to students who
stopped by their trailer from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
The slogan describes the Gators football
team's goal of winning another national champi-

cellence in the classroom, said KeJuan Wilkins
a Nike spokesman.
The T-shirt giveaway was part of Nike's ef-

A UF student group is turning the idea of
sustainability into a reality on campus.
Students in Free Enterprise, a business
organization, is holding a sustainable entre-
preneurship forum Dec. 1 to focus on oppor-
tunities that sustainability trends bring to the
business world.
The forum will give students the chance
to network with local entrepreneurs who
implement sustainable practices in their
businesses and find success in doing so, ac-cording to host Kyle Futch.
"More importantly, by implementing sus-
tainable practices, businesses do not burden
society with negative environmental conse-
quences," Futch said. "Instead, they take re-
sponsibility for their actions, adding value to
society as a whole."
The forum will take place in Bryan Hall 232
on Dec. 1 from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. For more

Shelter to serve
meals at 2 locations
By KRISTEN BOWE
Alligator Contributing Writer
The St. Francis House will serve
Thanksgiving dinner to at least 500
homeless people Thursday with a
little help from the city.
This year, the shelter will serve
food to the homeless community
from the St. Francis House, 413 S
Main St., and the Martin Luther
King Jr. Center, 1024 NE 14th St.,
from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.
Kent Vann, executive director
for the St. Francis House, said it was
important to expand to another lo-
cation to meet local demand.
A permit the St. Francis House
holds with the city prohibits the or-
ganization from serving more than
130 people in one place. By expand-
ing to the MLK Center, the shelter
will be able to accommodate an-
other 300 people at a time, though
there is no cap on the number of
meals that can be served at the MLK
center. According to Vann, 1,000
were served last Thanksgiving, and
numbers have been rising becauseof the economy.
"It shows there are times you
have to look through things to make
sure people are being served," he
said, adding that the city's efforts to
work with the center mean a lot.
Vann expects to provide 150
pounds of turkey and 100 pounds of
potatoes, all of which was donated
by members of the community.
The dinner will be staffed with
250 volunteers this year, and he
encourages any stu-
Local dents in town for the
News holiday to help by
arriving at 7:30 a.m.
to either the shelter or the recreation
center.
Vann said the St. Francis House
and the city are currently working
on expanding the special-use permit
so the shelter can expand its serving
privileges on major holidays.
For now, he said the shelter still
needs cooked turkeys, stuffing,
canned vegetables, sugar, brown
sugar and yams.
"It's a community effort," he
said. "It's pretty special."WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 25, 2009 U ALLIGATOR, 3

Shoppers ready to grab gadgets

Valerie Fritts only has one more thing to get
before she studies abroad in Spain next semester.
With a flight booked and a visa stamped in her
passport, Fritts said the only thing she is missing
is a camera.
"I've put off buying one because it seems like
they are so expensive," said Fritts, a junior study-
ing journalism. "When I went to Best Buy and re-
alized things were much cheaper than normal, it
was such great news."
Fritts saw for herself the record-low prices on
many types of electronics the rest of the country
has been experiencing since the end of summer.
Items such as digital cameras, flat-screen televi-
sions and game systems have steadily decreased
since the summer, according to the Consumer
Electronics Association.
Local stores are planning to bank on customers
looking for good deals.
"We are hoping that this year is going to be re-
ally big," said Rose Taylor, Sears cashier manager.
"I think that people have become more conscious
of how much money they are spending, so they
are willing to come out on that day because there
are so many good deals."
She added Sears extended its Black Friday sale
to include the whole month.
According to Archer Road Radio Shack man-
ager Brandon Gerhalen, most stores will do what-
ever it takes on Black Friday because they make
more money on that one day than on any other
day out of the year.
"You can equal a week's worth of sales in one
day," Gerhalen said. "You might get two times
00 BEYOND THE GRIDIRONthe amount of people that buy in a single day, but
those people will buy three or four times as much
as they would normally buy."
Fritts said she would love if prices continued
to drop.
"That would mean my parents would be
spending less money, and spending less money is
always a good thing."
Mark Rush, UF professor in the department of
economics, is not surprised at the change in the
price of electronics.
"I think that people have become
more conscious of how much money
they are spending, so they are will-
ing to come out on that day because
there are so many good deals."
Rose Taylor
Sears cashier manager
"The way these items are manufactured has
progressed rapidly. This sort of technological
progress has lowered the cost of their production,
increased their supply and thereby lowered the
price," Rush said.
"I expect this is something of a wash from the
overall economy-wide perspective, but from the
perspective of electronic retailers versus other
retailers of clothing and furniture, it can be very
important."
With regards to the holiday season, Rush said
the drop in price is no coincidence. He said he sus-
pects many electronics companies have schedules
for changing and lowering prices around the holi-
days as one way for them to try to pick up sales.

Students pray, give thanks at Mass on the Grass
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students started giving thanks
a little bit early on Tuesday.
Despite the cold, damp air and
wet grass, about 100 people gath-
ered on the Plaza of the Americas
at noon for Mass on the Grass.
Father John Gillespie from St.
Augustine Church and Catholic
Student Center led a full-length
Mass for students, faculty and
passers-by.
A white tent covered the altar,
and students sat and knelt on their
jackets or book bags while they lis-
tened to Scripture readings, sang
hymns and prayed together.
Debby Cherwak, director of
student programs for St. Augus-
tine Church, said although Mass
on the Grass has been held several
times before, this was the first time
it took place on the Plaza of the
Americas since she attended UF in
the 1970s.
"I think it's a first for all the stu-
dents who are currently going to
school," she said.
Cherwak said the Mass had
been held on the Reitz Union
North Lawn in previous semesters,
and there will probably be another
Mass on the Grass in January.Gillespie said more students
attended the Mass when he was
a UF student 40 years ago, and it
included a canned food drive for
Thanksgiving.
"We'd like to return to doing
this as a regular Thanksgiving
thing," Gillespie said.
"Even if you're not Catholic,
it's just a way to get to know
God better."
Mary McDermott
UF senior
After the Mass, participants
lined up for hamburgers and hot
dogs provided by the Newman
Club, which also provides din-
ner for churchgoers after Mass on
Tuesday nights.
UF senior Mary McDermott,
who works as an intern with Ch-
erwak, said she was impressed
with the turnout despite the wet,
muddy ground.
McDermott said people of all
faiths were welcome to attend the
Mass. It was held to give thanks,
which she said was the point this
week.
"Even if you're not Catholic,
it's just a way to get to know God
better," she said.Photo provided by Debbie Cherwak

Editorial
he mass turkey exodus seems to begin earlier each
year. Judging by the surprisingly low volume of an-
gry letters in our inbox Tuesday, it looks like most of
our faithfully vengeful readers have already flown the coop.
We feel abandoned. Because campus is quiet enough to
hear our hearts break at this shortage of students to enrage,
we're happy to present you with a we'll-have-to-be-twice-
as-offensive-to-make-up-for-the-difference edition of.
Darts &Laurels
First up, we'd like to personally attack the charac-
ter and academic dedication of all those students who
have already left Gainesville. Yes, we might just be jeal-
ous that we have to stay here and keep the poorly wired,
poorly ventilated, basically crumbling Alligator building
from burning down. But we're still going to throw a you-
don't-care-about-UF-or-Gainesville-or-the-Alligator-how-
could-you-betray-us-like-this? DART at absentee Gators.
Not that they'll be here to read this anyway.
But you might be asking, where are our hearts? It's
Thanksgiving, a time to appreciate the little things. Well,
our hearts are frozen, but they're on defrost like the tur-
key in Mom's fridge. They're not quite warmed up yet,
though.
Petty criminal and UF student Maxime Sparfel, paid for
his Moe's meal at the Student Rec. Center with a counter-
feit $10 bill on Sunday. Nervous Sparfel went on to ask for
change for another counterfeit $10 bill, arousing suspicion
that led to his arrest and the confiscation of an additional
$150 in counterfeit bills.
We love the movie "Mo' Money," but even the Wayans
Brothers had a better scam than this. That's why we have
to throw a this-is-the-highest-caliber-of-criminal-you-can-
produce? DART at UF.
At least this is a step up from the grad-student-shoe
thief earlier this month.
For a group that pushed our hearts all the way to the
back of the freezer this month, we'd like to continue to
hate on the Dove World Outreach Center hate group,
which has drawn controversy for spreading its messages
against Islam on the shirts of children. The shirts in ques-
tion read "Islam is of the Devil," and for sending their
children out to proselytize in schools, we have to throw
a stop-hiding-behind-your-kids-you-cowardly-crusaders
DART at the center's members. Somehow, we don't think
we'll ever get over the antics of this group.
The American Civil Liberties Union took up the Crazy
World Outreach Center's case this week, claiming that
the children's First Amendment right to political speech
was violated by the School Board of Alachua County. For
taking on a case that no one would want, and for doing
everything possible to keep us from sliding down the slip-
pery slope of censorship, we are happy to give a we're-
surprised-you-can-even-stand-to-be-in-the-same-room-
as-these-wackos LAUREL to the ACLU. Keep it up, even
if you are doomed to lose.
Defrost is over. We knew we couldn't keep the anger
up for too long with family and that wonderful turkey
buzz just around the corner.
It was saddening to hear reports this week that the
number of homeless in Alachua County has risen dramati-
cally, but the St. Francis House -with some help from
the city -will be out in force to provide Thanksgiving
dinner to at least 500 homeless people. The kindness of
this organization and its volunteers, along with good deci-
sions on the city's part, will allow many of these people
to enjoy some of the comforts that those absentee Gators
are already enjoying. We'd like to give a fully-defrosted-
warm-heart LAUREL to the city and St. Francis House.
That's it for this week. Keep up the generosity year-
round Gators!

Give sincere thanks for Thanksgiving
ook, I know that it's traditionally that time of yearwhen I should spout off about the things I'm grate-
ful for in my life. I get annoyed when people act like
you have to be thankful for every mundane thing just be-
cause it's the fourth Thursday in November.
So, in the anti-spirit of Thanksgiving, let me list some
of the things that do not inspire in me any sense of thank-
fulness.
I am not thankful for airports. My family lives in Texas,
so I've become a frequent flier. First, that limit-on-liquids
rule is sexist. I have to bring lotion, makeup, hair prod-
ucts and the normal things like shampoo and toothpaste.
One quart-sized bag does not cut it. There goes $20 on my
checked-in bag. Then, you have the weirdos on planes.
I've started wearing my sunglasses through the entire
flight just so people don't try to strike up awkward con-
versations with me about my sandwich choices.
I am not thankful for the amount of projects, papers
and ridiculous Wildlife Issues homework I have had due
the past few days. I really don't care that the bandicoots
are an insectivorous marsupial.
I am not thankful that I got sick two days before
Thanksgiving and might be unable to taste the turkey by
the time it rolls around. Thanks a lot to the snot-nosed sev-
enth graders my mom teaches. I'm not thankful for you,
either.
I am not thankful for canned cranberry sauce. Whose
idea was that? How do you even eat that? Dip the turkey
in it? It's like solid ketchup or something. Gross.
I am not thankful for the immense amount of ironing
I will have to do to make the Thanksgiving-themed nap-
kins, tablecloths and place mats presentable.
I'm not thankful that I have to write this column from
home when my vacation has already started. Have youHilary Lehman
Ietters@alligator orgever tried finding something new to
say about Thanksgiving? It was old
news to the Founding Fathers. It's
not easy to bring a fresh perspective
to the discussion.
OK, I'm exaggerating. There are
so many things for which I am in-
credibly thankful. I'm graduating in
a month, I have a great family and I
am happy with my life.
But I do wish that Thanksgiving were less about a
forced feeling of thankfulness and more about genuinely
feeling grateful for what we do have.
Thanksgiving isn't happy for everyone. For those who
have lost people close to them or those who are spending
the holiday alone, Thanksgiving can serve as a reminder
of what is missing instead of a cause for celebration.
This Thanksgiving, I'll be thankful for the things I have.
But I'll be honest about the things I can't be grateful for.
I imagine that even the Pilgrims saw their Thanksgiv-
ing as bittersweet. They were celebrating their first har-
vest, but they had all left their homeland and seen mem-
bers of their community die in the process.
You don't have to be thankful for the bad economy.
You don't have to be happy about spending all day in traf-
fic gridlock. You might not even be excited about having
to spend half a week with your extended family.
There's nothing wrong with that. I've come to believe
that having a thankful spirit is about giving thanks for a
few things rather than putting a smile on and listing the
top 10 things you're thankful for this year at dinner.
And I really do hate that cranberry sauce.

Kids should not be billboardsFind it hard to believe that anyone can
fight for the continuation of this fearmon-
gering by the religious extremists going
on in this city. They claim it's "freedom of
speech," but I call it mental terrorism.
Imagine you're an innocent elementary
school student, and it's your first day in a real
school. You have yet to establish any views
on politics, religions, etc. Now imagine that
you're approached by someone wearing an
anti-Islam shirt, telling you that this group of
people will burn forever in hell, as you will if
you don't feel the same way.
Do you honestly think at that stage of
your life you were capable of blowing the
extremists off as mere crazies? Of course not
-your lack of world experience and knowl-
edge would most likely allow them to get
into your head, filling your thoughts with
mythical fire and endless torture.
Not surprisingly, this is exactly what the
extremists count on. They don't want to com-
fort you with a loving message of peace but
rather scare you senseless until you think
how they think, hate how they hate and hate
whom they hate. Obviously I'm overjoyed
that the School Board of Alachua County
took a stand against these child poster boards
and kicked them off campus.
Separation of church and state should
mean that at a government-funded institu-
tion, we can rest assured that there is zero
tolerance for any sort of religious fearmon-
gering. Sure, they can claim that it's their free-
dom of expression, but there must be a limit.
If this lawsuit goes though, there's no tell-
ing what the extremists could get away with.
Opening this Pandora's box will show every
other religious group that it's OK to use yourKevin Olivier children as walking
Spea kingOut billboards to spread
hate. Sure, first the
government can let
the shirts slip through, but what's next? Do
we really have to wait for children to start
violent crusades in the name of whatever
the hell their parents believe in for us to say
enough is enough?
And in response to Howard Simon pro-
claiming that the shirts are about "[the stu-
dents'] views on politics, religion and his-
tory," come on. Can someone really be that
blatantly ignorant? The students wearing
these shirts don't have a choice in the matter.
Their parents, their church and other trusted
organizations force their children into wear-
ing the shirts. Can't he see that a simple,
"Honey, by wearing this shirt, you're going
to make God very happy," will persuade any
extremist-raised child?
There is a reason why the government has
age limits on so much of today's society; they
recognize that younger children don't yet
have the experience necessary to make sound
judgments in almost any scenario.
This goes to say that their views on poli-
tics and such are most likely the views forced
upon them by their parents.
To spread a cult's message of hate and in-
tolerance by way of innocent children is one
most disgusting acts imaginable.
If the government backs down and al-
lows these groups to wear their "Islam is of
the Devil" shirts on elementary school cam-
puses, there's no stopping them from going a
step further next time.

Florida faces No. 2 Michigan State on Friday
Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
UF guard Ray Shipman makes a breakaway layup during the Gators'
68-52 win over the Seminoles in the O'Connell Center on Tuesday.HOOPS, from page 14
more point guard Erving Walker
noted after the game how critical
a nonconference win against a
quality opponent will be in boost-
ing the team's chances of return-
ing to the NCAA Tournament.
"It's a big win. I say it's a big
win for us not because it's FSU,
but because they're a good team,"
Walker said. "That's a good win
for our r6sum6, and it should
come in and help us down the line
at the end of the season."
The Gators also proved in the
first half they are capable of beat-
ing teams even without freshman
guard Kenny Boynton lighting up
the scoreboard.
Donovan said FSU went out of
its way to contain Boynton in thefirst half, and UF's leading scorer
was scoreless at halftime, but the
rest of Florida's players stepped
up to fill the void.
Sophomore guard Ray Ship-
"It's a big win. I say it's a
big win for us not because
it's FSU, but because
they're a good team."
Erving Walker
UF sophomore point guard
man and junior power forward
Alex Tyus each scored eight, and
the Gators' defense took care of
the rest, forcing 16 first-half turn-
overs and keeping the Seminoles
to just 8-of-22 shooting. Boynton
did come alive in the second half,
however, scoring 13 points to tiethe team lead.
"It just shows how good of an
all-around team we are," junior
forward Chandler Parsons said.
"There's gonna be games like that
for Kenny, but he fought through
it, didn't let it get in his head.
It's not like he was frustrated he
wasn't scoring, because we were
up 20."
The one thing the win didn't
prove, Donovan said, is whether
or not Florida is ready for its
toughest opponent of the season.
UF faces No. 2 Michigan State
(4-0) in Atlantic City, N.J., on Fri-
day.
"How we handle a Michigan
State, how we handle some of the
things that are going to come our
way -we'll wait and see," Dono-
van said.
PICKS, from page 14
rock like Toby and not get stereotyped as a fullback.
Then, just when Toby needs him the most, Bobby jumps off
the bandwagon and picks Jimmy Clausen and Notre Dame.
I don't know how he gets on the step stool to look himself
in the mirror every morning. I haven't been enamored with
Gerhart or Stanford the way Bobby has this year, but I can tell
you one thing I know to be true: Notre Dame sucks.
Yea, we thought for a while the Fighting Irish might not ac-
tually suck, but they most certainly do.
Their star quarterback got stuck in the face in front of his
girl after a loss to UConn. That's right, they lost to UConn in
football and all Clausen has to show for it is an embarrassing
shiner. The Fighting Irish are losers on and off the field, just like
Bobby. -KYLE MAISTRI
Now on to the picks!
Back in first place with a 63-56 record is Kyle "Buy it now"
Maistri, who spends all his time searching for deals on eBay. He
just put in a bid for used socks, and we're getting concerned.
Just behind him in second at 62-57 is Bobby "D comes before
C, right?" Callovi, who put himself behind DiFer in this picks
column even though we break ties by alphabetical order. Next
week, he learns primary colors and times tables.
Tied with Bobby is the Tampa Tribune's Mike "Perception
is reality" DiFerdinando, who learned a valuable truth Tues-day: There is no way it should be, just the way it is.
Sitting at fourth with a 59-60 record is the Gainesville Sun's
Ed "And I was just getting my hat," Aschoff, who was upset to
miss out on the KKK rally that took place outside the LSU-Ole
Miss game back in his home state of Mississippi. Don't worry
Ed I'm sure you can make the next one.
Comfortably in fifth with 56-63 record is Mike "I am MLS"
McCall, who insulted DiFer for thinking Saturday's MLS final
was on Sunday. .Oh wait, it was Sunday. We hope MLS's No.
1 fan didn't miss it, we know everyone else in the world did.
In sixth place, jumping up from ninth, with a 53-66 record is
the Miami Herald's Joe "Good job" Goodman, who we refuse
to say anything negative about. Keep up the great work, Joe.
Oh, and he is moving to a farm. Not to say that's a bad thing.
We're sure plenty of people dream of owning a farm in New-
berry one day.
Please give a warm welcome to our resident of seventh place
with a 51-68 the Palm Beach Post's Ben "Give me that" Volin,
who has finally made it out of last place after what seemed like
an eternity. He celebrated it with the fans in Ben Hill Griffin,
giving out a high-five to one lucky Gators fan. Too bad he had
no idea who you are Ben.
Tied with Volin is Phil "What's wrong with me" Kegler,
who is starting to get concerned that his neverending hunger
and his daily intake of 4,000 calories, almost double the recom-
mended amount, is not healthy. What could have every made
you think that?
In ninth place at 50-67 is the Florida Times-Union's Mike"Just the two of us" DiRocco, who doesn't go anywhere with-
out AP writer Mark Long. We're telling your wife.
Our new occupant in dead-last with a 48-69 record is the
Orlando Sentinel's Jeremy "What's up, Bobby?"Fowler, who
finds himself lonely enough to call his correspondent "just be-
cause." He just needs a little affection.

KICKOFF: Saturday 3:30 p.m.

After last week's great matchups,
I can only hope rivalry week will give
us some thrilling games like Florida's
last-second 62-3 victory over FlU, Ala-
bama's narrow 45-0 escape of Chatta-
nooga or Texas' 51-20 tough win over
Kansas. This week's slate has games
with great history such as Alabama-
Auburn, Florida-Florida State, Clem-
son-South Carolina and UCLA-USC.
But as usual at the alligatorSports
Brand Picks Column, we love doing the
unexpected.
So of course we will be arguing Stan-
ford vs. Notre Dame.
ND WILL COVER THE +8.5 SPREAD BE-
CAUSE. I'm not sure why, actually. I
love Toby Gerhart.
I think Jim Harbaugh has done an
amazing job with Stanford in a short
time period. And I definitely think the
Cardinal are the better team.
Then, there is Notre Dame. Charlie
Weis is likely to be fired. Starting quar-
terback Jimmy Clausen was sucker
punched coming out of a restaurant
earlier in the week. The Fighting Irish
have lost three games in a row, and ev-
erything seems to be falling apart. And
that's why they are my pick this week.
Sure, the team is in complete disar-
ray and nothing is looking good, but
they have no where to go but up.
At least, I hope.
And if they don't improve any this
week, then the past shows they won't
lose by much. In its five losses this sea-
son, Notre Dame has not lost by more
than 7 points. -BOBBY CALLOVI

fense. FSU (3-1) had 16 first-half
turnovers to just three assists,
and UF went on a 33-9 run in the
last 13 minutes of the period.
But the Seminoles fought
back early in the second half,
cutting the Gators' lead to five
points eight minutes after the
break.
"There was a stretch there in
the second half that reminded
me of last year," Donovan said.
"I saw some flashbacks during
the game, but for the most part,
we've gotten better in those ar-
eas."
With 11:15 left in the game
the Seminoles lost their mo-
mentum when senior forward
Dan Werner
drew a charge
on FSU's Ryan
Men's Reid, halting
the Seminoles'Basketball 19-4 run and
swinging the
game back in Florida's favor for
good.
"During the half, I was telling
everyone they're a good team
and they're gonna come back,"
said Werner, who also hit two
3-pointers and led the team with
four assists. "It was all about
how we responded to that. But
we responded the right way."

My friend and I were in the front row of

Sports is definitely a what-have-you-done-

Noah is leading the league in rebound-
ing (11.9 per game), averaging 11.5 points pertheir teams," Donovan said. "They really are
doing very, very well there. They're guys that
are playing and are major parts of their teams."
All three guys were top-10 picks in the draft,
though Horford was really the only one to play
substantial minutes in his first two seasons.

college wasn't that they were more talented or
physically gifted than everyone else, it was that

Gators find aim in rout of Blazers
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Staff Writer
etorrens@a Iigator org
In its last two games, Florida shot below its stan-
dards.
Tuesday was a sharp turn in the right direction.
UF rode improved shooting and set the tone early in
a 75-39 thrashing of UAB.
Florida opened the game with a Jordan Jones
3-pointer and never looked back from there.
The Gators, who never trailed throughout the game,
hit their first four shots in a row -all 3-pointers. It was
a completely different beginning than UF experienced
Friday night when it found itself in a 23-point hole af-
ter the first half at Pittsburgh.
"One of the things I think is a strength of this team
is how they respond when they're challenged," coach
Amanda Butler said.
The team rectified its trend of slow starts with a
blistering pace and shot out to a 12-4 lead in the first
five minutes.
The Gators came out with a different starting lineup
than their previous games with Susan Yenser and Ndi-
di Madu in for Trumae Lucas and Azania Stewart.
Yenser, the team's most consistent 3-point shooter
coming into the game, contributed an early 3-pointer
and finished the night with nine points and four assists
while grabbing six rebounds.A staple of the starting lineup, senior Steffi Sorens-
en redeemed herself after a scoreless night against the
Panthers.
She nailed back-to-back 3-pointers in the first half
and finished as the game's leading scorer with 15
points. After shooting 0 for 7 from 3-point range on
Friday, Sorensen finished the game 5-of-10 from be-
yond the arc.
"It felt good that they finally did go in," Sorensen
said. "But I don't want to let that af-
fect other parts of my game."
It wasn't just Sorensen who lit up
the Blazers from the field. The whole
ji ll team shot at a markedly improved
rate.
The team finished 26 of 46 from the
field (56.5 percent) and 11 of 21 (52.4
Sorensen percent) from downtown.
"We knew it was going to come,"
Butler said. "We've got great shooters so you know it's
there, that it's going to happen."
The Gators did more than shoot the ball well. They
dominated the boards with a 47-30 rebounding advan-
tage over the Blazers. Unable to boast as experienced
and physical a frontcourt as past opponents, UAB had
its hands full with Florida's inside game.
Sharielle Smith finished with 9 points and eight re-
bounds while Madu chipped in 8 points and nine re-
bounds.

they cared about playing together as a team and outwork-
ing their competition. And that translates over time.
"You never know what the future is going to hold, and
sometimes when you look at a guy's career early, it's re-
ally hard to say and put him in a box and say, 'This is the
way his career is going to be,"' Donovan said. "At least
with those guys that I've coached. Because they're too in-
telligent, they have too much character and they work too
hard."
Donovan should be commended for the way he pre-
pares his guys to succeed at the next level.
Former Gators David Lee (New York Knicks), Udonis
Haslem (Miami Heat), Jason Williams (Orlando Magic),
Matt Bonner (San Antonio Spurs) and Marreese Speights
(Philadelphia 76ers) are all making significant contribu-
tions to their NBA squads, which says a lot about what a
player learns while in college under Donovan.
"I think if you're not going to work hard here, you're
not going to make it," UF senior Dan Werner said. "I think
that's what coach Donovan brings. That's what he wants
out of his guys, and those guys are great examples."
So thank you, coach Donovan.
The Gator Nation appreciates being able to flip on the
TV and watch its college hoops heroes do some serious
work in the NBA.
And so does Noah's African Vikings (my first-place
fantasy team).

Bowden will look to pull big upset in possible last visit
0 NO UNRANKED FSU TEAM
HAS DEFEATED A RANKED
UF TEAM.
By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer

The Swamp will say goodbye to
a legend Saturday, but he will not be
wearing any orange or blue.
A successful day for him would
result in plenty of tears in Ben Hill
Griffin Stadium, but few would be
joyous.
With coach-in-waiting Jimbo
Fisher set to take the helm at FSU
sometime during the next two years,
Bobby Bowden will likely be taking
Florida Field for the last time when
the No. 1 Gators (11-0, 8-0 Southeast-
ern Conference) host the Seminoles
(6-5, 4-4 Atlantic Coast Conference)
at 3:30 p.m for Senior Day.He will try for his eighth win
in 17 trips to The Swamp when he
wraps up his 33rd regular season as
the Seminoles coach Saturday. He
currently ranks second all time in
wins among Football Bowl Subdivi-
sion coaches behind Penn State's Joe
Paterno. Bowden and Paterno are
two of only four active coaches to be
inducted into the College Football
Hall of Fame.
"What they've accomplished
-that won't be touched," Florida
coach Urban Meyer said. "That's an
untouchable accomplishment. I per-
sonally have great admiration for
both those guys. They do it the right
way. They're class individuals, and
they truly love their players. It's not
about coach Bowden. It's not about
coach Paterno.
"The significance of those two,
what those two have done for the
game of football -enjoy it, because
you'll never see anything close tothat again."
A victory would give Bowden a
shocking Swamp sendoff. The Semi-
noles are more than three-touch-
down underdogs, and they are fac-
ing a possible sixth regular-season
loss for only the second time since
Bowden's first season in 1976.
If they are to pull
the upset, they will
have to do it with
their backup quar-
Football terback, redshirt
freshman EJ Manuel.
Starter Christian Ponder went down
with a season-ending shoulder inju-
ry three weeks ago, a tough blow for
an offense that had racked up 400
yards of total offense in seven of its
first nine games under Ponder.
Manuel has stepped in and led
Florida State to back-to-back wins
over Wake Forest and Maryland, but
those teams are a combined 6-16 and
rank 73rd and 88th, respectively, intotal defense.
Florida ranks second in the coun-
try, allowing 229.8 yards per game,
and is No. 1 in scoring defense, giv-
ing up 9.8 points per game.
The Gators have won the last two
meetings by a combined 63 points,
and never in the 52-year history of
the rivalry has an unranked FSU
team defeated a ranked UF squad.
"Two years they've ripped us,"
Bowden said. "I imagine they ripped
everybody else the same way. We're
about like anybody else.
"Not anybody is going to beat
them with an imperfect ball game.
They're too good. We're going to
have to play the best we can play,
and they're going to have to turn the
ball over. Upsets are caused by turn-
overs. When a superior team, No.
1, is playing somebody not ranked,
then the only thing that neutralizes
it is turnovers."
The Gators had started the sea-son turnover-happy with 13 in their
first seven games but have now gone
four games without a single one.
And while Florida might not be
the offensive juggernaut of a year
ago, FSU's defense might hold the
recipe for a cure. The Seminoles are
giving up 434.4 yards per game,
which puts them 106th out of 120
FBS teams. Topping it all off will
be a pregame Senior Day ceremony
recognizing Florida's 25 seniors that
have gone 25-2 inside The Swamp.
In typical Meyer fashion, he
hasn't allowed his team to overlook
its rival, despite the fact he has yet
to lose in four tries to the "team out
West," as he refers to the Seminoles.
"This is as big a game as this
school has ever had," Meyer said.
"What makes FSU dangerous is
their athletes. Those are all great sto-
rylines. I wish they didn't have good
players -then no, they wouldn't be
a serious threat."
