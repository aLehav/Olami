  At 4:03 a.m. Sunday, just min-
utes before the madness started, 
one crash on Interstate 75 seemed almost ordinary.
  A silver Toyota heading south 
through the haze of smoke and fog slammed into the guardrail in the far-left lane. The driver of the car veered to the right, coming to a stop in the grass off the highway.
  Nothing too serious; all of the 
passengers were safe. One woman called 911 to report the crash and request a tow truck. They were about three miles south of the Ar-cher Road exit, and the call was calm and routine.
  Three and a half minutes into 
the conversation, the Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce dispatcher prepared to hang up.
  “I’m going to have to let you 
go,” the dispatcher said. “We have a lot of lines ringing right now, but we do have help going out there with you, and—”
  “Oh, s**t!” the caller interrupt-
ed. “Another crash. Oh my gosh.”
  In the 911 call released by the 
Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce on Monday after-noon, the dispatcher pressed the woman for more information. It was across the median in the northbound lane, said the woman, whose name was edited out of the tape.
  A truck was involved. Other than that, though, the woman couldn’t give any more detail.
  She could barely see her hand in front of her face, she said. And on a morning when nature blind-folded drivers — leaving 10 dead, 21 hospitalized and countless more lives forever changed — the wom-an on the phone could only rely on sound to paint the tragedy.
  Her friend thought she heard 
a couple other crashes earlier. She wasn’t sure, though. She knew she heard something.
  Then, just as the dispatcher 
tried to hang up, the group heard a sharp, loud ping. The crash was undeniable. The woman on the phone started talking to someone else in the area. Fifty-six seconds later, another sharp noise, like an aluminum baseball bat connect-ing.
  One minute, 24 seconds passed. 
The dispatcher asked how many people were injured. The woman cut her off: “Uh-oh. Uh-oh. An-other one.”
  The dispatcher asked for de-
tails. The woman didn’t know. The dispatcher asked if chemicals were involved. A loud pop.
  “Another one,” the woman told 
the dispatcher. “Oh my goodness. This is bad.”
  Crying ﬁ  lled the background. 
Fifty-ﬁ  ve seconds later, another crash. The dispatcher asked anoth-er question. Fifteen seconds later, 
Gators guard Brad 
Beal took home his 
SEC-leading fourth 
Freshman of the Week 
honor on Monday.

  Apple Inc. is integrating technological 
advancement into the world of education.
  The company introduced the launch of 
iBooks 2.0, an application available for iP-
hone and iPad only, on Jan. 19.
  According to Apple’s website, iBooks 2.0 
is “an entirely new kind of textbook that’s dynamic, current, engrossing and truly in-teractive.”
  The iPad version is a touch screen-friend-
ly textbook featuring interactive diagrams, videos, multi-dimensional objects, photos and easy note-taking abilities. The launch also includes access to iBooks Author, a free app that would allow professors to create their own textbooks.  Top publishers such as McGraw-Hill, 
Pearson and Houghton Mifﬂ  in Harcourt have already added textbooks to the online store.
  John Sculley, former CEO of Apple and 
co-worker of the late Steve Jobs, said Apple 
has always had the inten-tion of changing educa-tion through technologi-cal innovation.
  “I understand that 
Steve saw the chance to reinvent the whole text-book market so that it would be less expensive and more accessible to 
more people,” Sculley said. “Apple is try-ing to make the iPad a standard for educa- Apple launches textbook appCITY ELECTIONS

  Today is not only election day for the 
Florida Republican Presidential Prefer-ence Primary, but it is also election day for two seats on the Gainesville City Commis-sion.
  After long hours of sign-holding, 
hand-shaking and debating, residents will have a chance to choose who will ﬁ  ll the Gainesville City Commission at-large 1 and District 1 seats.
  The polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 
7 p.m.
  All registered voters can vote at their 
designated precinct, which can be found at www.votealachua.com under the “My Voter Information Page,” said Pam Car-penter, county supervisor of elections. The website also has a list of candidates.
  Voters should bring a valid photo I.D. with a signature, she said. Gator 1 Cards will be accepted. 
  Only registered Republicans will have 
the primary on their ballots.
  Carpenter said she encourages every-
one to go out and vote, especially because the city elections are bipartisan.
  “We hear a lot of rumbling sometimes 
about how our government is working,” she said. “Voting is our way of giving di-rection, be it on the municipal, state or fed-eral level.”
  Mercedes Young, a 20-year-old tele-
communication management senior, said voting in city elections is even more im-portant than voting for the president.   Polls open today until 7 p.m.

The cause of the fire that led to a 
20-vehicle wreck, claiming at least 
10 lives Sunday, is still being inves-tigated as of Monday night.
Smoke continued to drift from 
Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park across U.S. 441 and Interstate 75 Monday as officials worked to douse the charred underbrush.
Florida Forest Service was dis-
patched to the prairie fire at 2:47 p.m. Saturday, said Ludie Bond, spokeswoman for the Florida For -
est Service. Various organizations have been working to contain and extinguish the fire ever since.
Bond said the fire was not start-
ed by lightning and was not the result of a controlled burn, but the cause isn’t known yet. She said the fire has been contained to 62 acres.
Bond walked around the spongy, 
charred underbrush Monday as of-ficials soaked the prairie with tens of thousands of gallons of water. A small puff of white smoke rose with each step she took.
This fire presents a special set 
of hurdles because it burned deep into the underbrush, which is about 10 feet of decomposing grasses and other plants. It’s not a matter of simply dousing the flames.
“This fire you can’t put out,” she said. “There’s no way you could drown this.”
Trucks from the Florida Forest 
Service, the Nature Conservancy and other organizations drove around the perimeter of the charred, smoking section of the prairie. They soaked the peat and set up sprin-klers every 50 feet around the edge of the burned ground.
Smoke spurted from hot spots 
in the ground like small fountains. The air smelled of a campfire as trucks drove through, kicking up more smoke and ash.
David Jowers, Paynes Prairie 
park manager, said the primary concern now is controlling the smoke in order to keep drivers safe.
The animals that live in the prai-
rie, including horses, birds and bi-son, know to run from smoke and are not in danger, he said.
Jowers spent Monday afternoon 
on the prairie with other respond-ers, working to get sprinklers set to water the area.
He said this fire wasn’t the larg-
est he’s seen. He said there was a wildfire in August that was larger.
Bonds said the burned area has 
to continue to be doused because low humidity and winds this week could help dry out the area again. She said Mother Nature was doing its best to make conditions difficult for responders.
“If you don’t do thorough mop 
up, it could dry out and flare up,” she said. TUESDAY, JANUARY 31, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 3

Paul F. Favini, interim director of 
the UF School of Theatre and Dance, 
died Sunday night after a period of ill-ness.
Favini, 51, was an associate profes-
sor of costume design and a UF faculty member since 2001. 
“He was a skilled costume designer 
and administrator,” said UF Public Af-fairs Director Janine Sikes. “He shared the passion of theater with all who he knew and worked with here.”
On his personal website, Favini 
listed design experience from about 60 productions. As a freelance costume designer, he worked on productions such as “The Marriage of Figaro,” “Ro-meo et Juliette” and “La Traviata.” Favini had a profound impact on 
the School of Theatre and Dance, Dean Lucinda Lavelli said. 
“He was a man of extraordinarily 
varied talents,” she said. “He under-stood the performer, and he under-stood the needs of the performer by 
way of technical the-ater.”
Associate profes-
sor Ralf Remshardt will serve as interim director in Favini’s place until the ap-pointment of a per-manent director, Sikes said. 
The exact cause of death has not 
been made public, she said.
Plans for a memorial service are be-
ing finalized.Interim director of School of

Go cure cancer. Go to Mars.
Go make a YouTube video about your 
school’s favorite phrases.
Go Gators.Cameron “Scooter” Magruder posted his 
video “Stuff Gator Fans Say” to YouTube at about  noon on Sunday . It already has more than 30,000 views. 
In the video’s 3 minutes and 3 seconds, 
23-year-old Magruder parodies UF’s “Go Gators” commercial,  takes some jabs at Flori-da State University , shouts at football referees and Tebows on Turlington Plaza.  
The video follows the “s**t people say” trend of YouTube videos that feature stereo-typical sayings of groups such as girlfriends, freshmen and parents.
Magruder said he made the video to get 
more subscribers to his YouTube channel and to attract a wider audience. He saw an oppor -
tunity when he noticed no one had made a video about things Gator fans say, he said.
He graduated from UF in Spring 2011 with 
a degree in telecommunication productions and started making videos in October 2011. 
Magruder’s video does not have any swear -
ing, unlike other “s**t people say” videos. He believes someone can be funny without being vulgar, and he said clean language also allows anyone to watch without being offended.
His sister, 24-year-old Ph.D. candidate in civil engineering Jeremy Magruder, appeared in the video and helped with the camera work.
“One of the highlights of his videos, I think, 
is that they’re clean comedy, and that’s some-thing a lot of people can’t do, you know,” she said. 
Scooter Magruder said he’s gotten only 
positive reactions from people about the vid-eo.
Eighteen-year-old Lauren Salter, a pre-
nursing freshman, laughed at the video on her laptop. She said she thinks the sayings in the video are accurate and that Gators fans do say them. 
Scooter said he learned video fundamen-
tals in his classes at UF. He shot his first video, “The Chronicles of Sledd 350,” in Sledd Hall, where he lived at the time.  
Since then, he has done videos such as 
“Why People Hate Tim Tebow” and “How to React to a Bad Gift.”
Magruder estimated he gained about 200 
subscribers as of press time from the new video. The “Stuff Gator Fans Say” video cur -
rently had about 400 “likes” and about 40 “dislikes.” 
“All the people who dislike it go to Florida 
State,” he said.

Joel Andreasen walked into Flash-
backs Cafe on Monday and ordered 
a 24 Carrot smoothie. His verdict: a full carrot flavor with a tinge of lem-on and apple.
Flashbacks Cafe, a grab-’n’-go cof-
fee shop, juice bar and bakery locat-ed at 211 W University Ave., opens its doors for business today. The cafe held a trial-run opening on Monday.
The cafe will offer coffee drinks, 
juices, smoothies, shakes, baked goods, salads, bagels, sandwiches and wraps. There will be something for everyone, said owner Steve Nich-tberger, 52.
Flashbacks Cafe is a grab-’n’-go 
type of place, but it offers high-qual-ity items, he said. 
“Our goal is to fill your belly, feed 
your soul and free your mind,” he said, “or at least let you use our free WiFi.”Starting Monday, the cafe will be 
open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Wednesday, 7 a.m. to 3 a.m. Thursday through Friday and 11 a.m. to 3 a.m. Saturday.
The cafe will create an artistic at-
mosphere, said Adam Whistler, 35, the cafe’s general manager.
The walls, painted in bright 
purple, orange and yellow, offer an eclectic selection of mugs. A set of shelves houses board games, includ-ing the ‘90s Game, The Game of Life and “Friends” Trivial Pursuit.
The smoothies and juices are made 
with fruits and vegetables. Nothing else is added, Nichtberger said.
Nichtberger is also the owner 
of Flashbacks Recycled Fashions, a Gainesville consignment shop that has been around since 1986. He said he’s worked in the restaurant busi-ness for 10 years.
He said the competition with 
other cafes downtown will help the city overall. It will give people more reason to go there, he said.
“We love what we do, but we’re 
no different than other cafes,” Nich-tberger said.Coffee shop, juice bar, bakery opens on West University Ave.FRANCIE WEINBERG

The president of the Gainesville Tea Party 
said she “would probably disagree” with the 
Tennessee Tea Party’s push to remove slavery from textbook references that make the Found-ing Fathers look bad.
“If they’re asking for an accurate rendition 
of what happened, then yes, I’ll support what they have to do, but I do not support a white-wash,” said Laurie Newsom, president of the Gainesville Tea Party. 
According to the Memphis Commercial Ap-
peal, the Tennessee Tea Party wants to remove material from textbooks so “no portrayal of mi-nority experience in the history which actually occurred shall obscure the experience or contri-butions of the Founding Fathers.” 
Steven Noll, a UF American history profes-
sor, said he believes calling for the removal of slavery from textbooks is disparaging, dismiss-ing and disrespectful. 
“That’s not history , it’s just lies,” Noll said. 
“It’s just making the past what we want it to be as opposed to what it was.”
He said the tea party needs to spend some 
time reading the Constitution and other pri-mary source documents in which the Founding Fathers condone slavery.
When Thomas Jefferson said all men were 
created equal, he didn’t necessarily mean it lit-erally, Noll said.
However, Noll said he believes the fact that 
the Founding Fathers were slaveholders hu-manizes them, which is much more realistic than their portrayal as heroes, an approach stu-dents are taught to take from an early age.
Sean Adams, a UF historian specializing in 
African-American studies, said slavery was a pivotal part of the American lifestyle, as was the nation’s ability to learn how to deal with African-Americans becoming a part of society in the years that followed emancipation. 
This includes the Jim Crow laws that 
spanned from 1876 to 1965.
Newsom, though, doesn’t see it as that big 
of a deal.
“You had the Jim Crow laws, but that was 
like a gnat on a boar’s butt,” she said. “We’ve got so many bigger fish to fry in this country.”Tenn. group wants history altered

Rhoda Chester, an 89-year-old 
hearing-impaired grandmother of 
nine, wants to understand her grand-children again.
“My grandchildren talk so low that 
I can’t hear them,” Chester said before a lipreading class Monday.
“You’re lucky,” joked Carolyn Ca-
racausa, 68. “Mine are loud.”
They and about 10 others became 
students again at a class at the United Way of North Central Florida, the first in a four-week series of lipreading classes.
UF’s Speech and Hearing Clinic 
and the Gainesville chapter of the Hearing Loss Association of Florida sponsor the free classes on Mondays from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m.
Pat Kricos, a UF professor of audi-
ology, has led the classes for 38 years.
Older patients often get hearing 
aids without learning strategies to communicate or how to speak up when they need help, she said.The class helps people learn that 
they are not alone in coping with hear -
ing loss, Kricos said.
Gaining the ability to lip-read is a 
combination of hearing any sounds possible, watching the speaker’s lips and using context clues, Kricos told the class.
For an hour, the students practiced 
with Kricos, her student assistants and each other. They learned how to rec-ognize what certain letters and words look like on a person’s lips.
For example, when someone says 
“fan,” his or her teeth come over the bottom lip. But for “van,” the move-ment is less pronounced.
Not at all discouraged, the students 
worked hard. They filled out multiple-choice worksheets, watching Kricos intently with glasses low on their noses and hearing aids tucked behind their ears.
“If we really get good at this, we 
can read what all the football coaches are saying,” joked Lynn Rousseau, president of the Gainesville’s HLAA chapter.
Kricos said the class will be fun and 
informative for her students.
“They need every little bit of help 
they can get,” she said. “If nothing else, just giving them confidence that, yeah, they can learn how to lip-read.”Lipreading class teaches participants to cope with hearing loss

A UF professor testified about potential 
voting limitations in a Florida election law 
before U.S. senators Friday afternoon. 
Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., invited UF po-
litical science professor Daniel Smith to testify before the Judiciary Committee. 
Smith focused on several amendments, 
including the shortening of the early vot-ing period from 14 days to eight. 
This would eliminate the final Sunday 
before election day, he said.
Smith said registration conducted by 
nongovernment groups will be a more dif-ficult process that will include penalties for violations such as turning in late reg-istration forms.
Kathy Kidder, 71, president of the 
League of Women Voters of Alachua County and Gainesville, said the statewide league is not registering voters “because 
of these unreasonable re-quirements.”
Smith also said voters 
who move within Florida counties will still be able to make address changes 
at the polls on election day but will have to cast provisional ballots. 
The number of uncounted provisional ballots could increase among residents such as college students, he said.
Kyle Burns, a 19-year-old political sci-
ence sophomore, voted early for Tuesday’s City of Gainesville election under the new law. 
“I think that there’s really no reason to 
pass it, because the whole idea of the bill was to prevent voting fraud,” he said. “But the instances of voting fraud, especially in Florida, are few and far-between.”

All presidential 
candidates ﬂ  awed
  From the top two candidates in the Republican race, it ap-
pears that GOP voters are looking for a few key things. They want a candidate who supports increased military 
interventionism, an expansion of the surveillance state, social conservative values and an individual health care mandate. 
  So why aren’t GOP voters supporting President Barack 
Obama? 
  During his presidency, Obama has supported policies that 
would not set him much further apart from the current top two GOP contenders. 
  Although he spoke out against the Patriot Act and Guantan-
amo Bay during his campaign in 2008, he ended up signing an extension of the former and has hardly taken any steps to close the latter. 
  The Department of Homeland Security has only become more 
invasive, monitoring the Internet and beeﬁ  ng up airport security to extreme levels with body scanners and grandma groping. 
  The president also recently signed the National Defense Au-
thorization Act, a bill some opponents argue will give the gov-ernment unprecedented power to indeﬁ  nitely detain U.S. citi-zens. 
  And Obama has not decreased the involvement of the U.S. in 
foreign conﬂ  icts. While slowly drawing down our presence in Iraq, the president increased the number of troops in Afghani-stan, intervened in Libya and has been performing drone opera-tions elsewhere in the Middle East. 
  Does it sound like Obama should be running for the Repub-
lican nomination, too?  
  It gets worse.   Obama has always been against gay marriage, and usually 
never brings up the issue of LGBT equality. While he might have worked to end “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” that only affects a small percentage of the LGBT community . Meanwhile, the rest of the community is left without a voice if the contest is between Obama and Romney or Obama and Gingrich. 
  And if Republican voters are looking for a candidate who op-
poses government intervention in health care, they won’t ﬁ  nd that quality in Obama, Gingrich or Romney . 
  While Romney was governor of Massachusetts, he worked 
to pass a health care overhaul including an individual mandate, like the one in Obama’s health care reform bill. And according to a new report from The Atlantic, it appears as though Ging-rich expressed support for an individual mandate as recently as 2009. 
  Both Gingrich and Romney say they do not support this sort 
of government intervention on  a national level, but if these can-didates are willing to go against “free-market” principles in the past, what makes anyone think they will not do it again on an-other issue? 
  So, really, when looking at the three top candidates for the 
presidency , what’s the difference?  Women get bombarded with sadistic messages
  Macho Hollywood spawns dozens of blockbuster 
ﬁ  lms every year, most with a predictable recipe of the following: million-dollar budgets, violence and 
loose women with cleavage, cleavage and more cleavage.
  “Miss Representation,” which was shown last week at 
the Reitz Union, is the refreshing exception. This must-see documentary unveils the media’s vendetta against all things female, from advertising to the government, and the increas-ing sexualization and dehumanization of women.
  The ﬁ  lm features several inﬂ  uential women with even 
more powerful, positive agendas: Condoleezza Rice, Nancy Pelosi, Geena Davis, Rosario Dawson and Rachel Maddow, to name a few. These women speak of personal experiences of degradation and persuasion to change their appearance to the media’s liking.
  To label “Miss Representation” as a ﬁ  lm stemming from 
the feminist movement would be misleading. The ﬁ  lm is a well-rounded and bipartisan approach to showing viewers how women are being disrespected on a day-to-day basis and what the implications are on society as a whole.
  The war of female appearance over accomplishments has 
come to its peak with the dawn of this media-saturated age. With more access to more TV shows and websites than ever, girls at an impressionable young age are exposed to a mistak-enly superﬁ  cial portrayal of the ideal woman: skinny, beauti-ful and willing to fulﬁ  ll any man’s needs.
  Women, who comprise 51 percent of the country’s popu-
lation, according to the ﬁ  lm, are holding much less power at the top of industries and government than should be ac-ceptable.
  Rising rates of depression and physical abuse are becom-
ing a pandemic among young women who sacriﬁ  ce their healthy body image for one that our culture ﬁ  nds accept-able.
  Women are making slow gains in terms of inﬂ  uence. 
Only 17 percent of Congress is female, and the majority of the world’s most proﬁ  table media industries only have a handful of women on the board of members. The inequality in the corporate world cannot be ig-nored. 
  The ﬁ  lm does a fantastic job 
of pointing out that women are being held to a higher standard than men. In several TV seg-ments shown in the documentary, women in power were constantly 
scrutinized for every outﬁ  t and hairdo, while also having to answer questions that would never be directed toward men.
  One of the more resounding highlights the video points 
out is that we, as women, are our own worst critics. As women, we strive to mold ourselves into the picture-perfect woman, and we criticize other women who deviate from the norm or who choose to pursue goals that do not involve be-ing on the cover of a tabloid. 
  “Miss Representation” made me aware that female deg-
radation is a double-edged sword: Society teaches men at a young age to be masculine and to crave power and prestige. These shallow expectations are molding men into emotion-less people who are taught from video games and action ﬂ  icks to see women as nothing more than sex objects.
  While I applaud RUB for showing this exceptionally well-
made documentary, it is disappointing that last week’s view-ing was the ﬁ  rst time “Miss Representation” was shown in Florida. I hope, however, that this will be the ﬁ  rst of many thought-provoking ﬁ  lms with little or no female degradation to be shown in the UF cinema.
  Women should support ﬁ  lms like “Miss Representation” 
that advocate better media portrayals of women. Change is possible, but realizing that women are being bombarded with sadistic messages is the ﬁ  rst step to a more balanced, accepting world.

We readily scorn humanitarian cri-
ses in hindsight, but we have a selfish habit of ignoring those that 
persist in the present. Like the ostrich that buries its head, we feign that all is well even if we don’t see it.
When these crises become clear, we are 
quick to pass judgment on those involved while remaining indifferent to their circum-stances. It takes compassion to view these situations through the eyes of the individu-als who are most affected and who are often held accountable.
The state of Somalia is just one of to-
day’s crises that is rarely publicized from the perspective of those within. On Dec. 25, SEAL Team 6 parachuted into a Somali village, stormed a compound, rescued two hostages and left nine pirates dead. But while we celebrate our victory and denigrate the Somalis, the strife and struggle from which these people derive is forgotten.
Since a civil war erupted in 1991, Soma-
lia has had no centralized control over most of its territory. Numerous “transitional” governments have seized power and been ousted, while citizens flail and famish like infants without parents. 
Civil war and defective governments 
have meant no security for Somalia’s citi-zens. Domestically disorganized and inter -
nationally unrecognized, Somalia has no hands for development and no mouth for diplomacy.
Without a navy to guard its waters or 
allies to uphold international law, foreign trawlers harvest the limited fish reserves off the Somali coast. Starving Somalis watch as toxic waste washes onto their shores, illegal-ly dumped by European firms exploiting the crippled country. All the while, they endure the worst drought in 60 years. Ten million people are threatened by famine and 29,000 children have died within three months. 
Somali fishermen can’t compete with the 
foreign ships offshore. Reasonable work is unavailable throughout most of the country. In an effort to feed their families and them-selves, many seek less credible “employ-ment” as militia-men and pirates. 
Like brokers on 
Wall Street, these fishermen gravitate toward the high-ly concentrated wealth within their society. In both cases, this wealth 
is held by a few men at the top who pay high wages for risky work from desperate people. The difference is that Somali fisher -
men are fighting to feed their families while brokers are betting on Ferraris.
I am not suggesting amnesty for murder -
ers, and I recognize the dilemma of provid-ing aid to Somalis — too often this aid finds the hands of warlords — but it is no less important to shed our apathy, to openly and actively acknowledge the crisis.
I’m not inciting a military campaign. Un-
til Somalia’s unrest is quieted from within, we cannot expect peace and diplomacy from without. But fire is not fought with fire; Black Hawks and blame are loose bandages on festering wounds.
Viewing the issue through the eyes of 
the famished and forlorn lets us better un-derstand the causes and consequences of the crisis. We must take it upon our -
selves to empathize and to realize that they are as much a product of their envi-ronment as we are of ours. In our global society, we cannot afford this indifference; we must develop a global consciousness. And while there are wounds within our own country, we seem apathetic to them as well. 
President Obama appoints a Citigroup 
Inc. CEO to chief of staff and says the state of our union is “getting stronger.” Children starve in America and Gingrich wants to colonize the moon. Our bank accounts go untouched and our time un-volunteered. In our own country and abroad, little support is rallied in defense of human lives — but dare they touch our Internet, and at last we raise our voices.

Many media pundits attribute Newt Gingrich’s 
win in the South Carolina primary last Saturday to his attacks on the liberal media during his re-
cent debate performances.
The day before the primary, Gingrich called John King 
“despicable” for asking a question about his ex-wife’s claim in an interview that Gingrich asked her for an open marriage. Based on that question, I think we can infer Gingrich knows despicable behavior.
But was King despicable for asking Gingrich about this 
“Nightline” interview? Absolutely not.
The number of debates that have taken place in this 
primary make Charlie Sheen’s media barrage look re-strained. The candidates, more or less, all agree on the same fundamental ideas (Ron Paul excluded), and rarely in these debates do we hear the candidates offer anything new. If we don’t ask the candidates questions about their personal lives, CNN might as well just show a rerun of one of the November debates.
Gingrich used this question to unload on one of his fa-
vorite talking points: the “biased liberal media” myth.
If you have never watched Fox News, here is what I 
mean by the “biased liberal media” myth: All the major news outlets have a bias against conservatism and are ac-tively engaged in trying to make liberals look good and conservatives look bad.
This is simply not true. Journalists are taught to remain 
objective in their reporting. Objectivity is a point of pride for many professional journalists. While there is no deny-ing that publications such as The New York Times or The Washington Post have liberal leanings, they contain their political statements to the editorial page, just like con-servative publications such 
as The Wall Street Journal do.
Almost every news organization, whether it be news-
paper, magazine or broadcast television, is owned by a media conglomerate run by wealthy, conservative CEOs. If their organizations were too liberally biased, wouldn’t they intervene?
Conservatives generally point out that the mainstream 
media won’t report on the same stories and issues as Fox News.
Essentially, conservatives want the media to criticize 
liberals more often. The problem with that is the media has to remain objective. While the economy is in bad shape, the media cannot lob all their criticism at President Obama. It would be unfair.
Gingrich has been particularly focused on attacking 
the media in recent weeks. Besides the confrontation with King, he got into a heated exchange with Fox News’ Juan Williams over comments Gingrich made about blacks demanding paychecks, not food stamps, and earlier this week he criticized NBC’s Brian Williams for instructing the audience at Monday’s Republican debate to refrain from applauding and cheering.
It is no surprise that Gingrich’s recent rise in the polls 
comes at the same time his attacks on the media have in-creased. Conservative voters are buying into this liberal-bias-in-the-media myth.
The problem isn’t that conservative voters are consult-
ing only conservative news outlets. That is entirely their choice. My problem is that this liberal-media bashing is limiting conservative voters’ scopes of information.
A recent poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University showed 
that Fox News viewers are less informed than people who watch no television news. Fox News viewers are sub-jected to these attacks on the media, and it’s convincing them not to consult other news sources. The New York Times and The Washington Post may be considered lib-eral newspapers, but that doesn’t mean the things they report are false.
The same thing goes for liberals reading The Wall Street 
Journal. Just because you don’t agree with a paper’s edi-torial board doesn’t mean you shouldn’t read the paper.
People should seek knowledge as much as possible. 
We shouldn’t limit our scope to newspapers and news shows that reinforce our own opinions. We should try to expand our horizons and become more well-rounded and well-informed citizens.
Politicians need citizens to be knowledgeable. If we 
want our country to start heading in the right direction, we need voters who are well-informed when picking the leaders who will solve our problems.
Politicians and the media don’t have to be at war. In 
fact, they can both be tools in making our country less problematic.

Floridians were left empty-
handed last week when Taco Bell 
launched its breakfast menu in the West.
Taco Bell introduced its break-
fast menu Thursday to 750 restau-rants in 10 states, including Alaska, California and Arizona. The “First Meal” menu consists of 11 items, ranging from breakfast burritos and wraps to hash browns and Cinnabon pastries, according to a news release.
The restaurants in the eastern 
part of the U.S. will offer breakfast in 2013, the release stated.
Michelle Navar, 20-year-old 
chemical engineering sophomore, said she is interested in the new menu.
“I would buy it,” Navar said. 
“It’s seems like they are trying to close the gap between themselves and other places like McDon-ald’s.” 
Taco Bell joins other fast-food 
restaurants, such as Subway, Burg-er King and Wendy’s, that offer breakfast.
Matt Rubin, a 20-year-old tele-
communication junior, said he likes the idea of the new items.
“It gives them another option to 
make money during that time,” he said. 
Taco Bell started breakfast in 
western states where breakfast bur-ritos are more common, according to a news release. Taco Bell teamed up with Johnsonville, Cinnabon, Tropicana and Seattle’s Best Coffee to create a breakfast menu.
“I know it’s coming,” said Si-
mone Bailey, manager of the Taco Bell on West University Avenue.
Bailey said the majority of peo-
ple who eat at her restaurant are college students, and she expects more customers to come in dur-ing breakfast hours once the menu comes to Florida.Taco Bell not bringing its breakfast menu to Florida yet

First-grade teacher Virginia “Joey” Traynor 
spends two to three hours each weeknight — 
and most of her weekends — studying how to bring the most effective teaching methods to her classroom. She’s into her second semester of teaching and has written about 30 pages on her findings.         Traynor is part of the $6 million Investing 
in Innovation, or i3, grant program. The new program started in the fall and expands UF’s preexisting Florida Master Teacher Initiative into 20 high-poverty schools in Miami-Dade County . 
The Florida Master Teacher Initiative trains 
teachers to improve their practice. It involves about 1,000 teachers in Collier, Duval, Miami-Dade and Pinellas counties and will be ex-panded through the i3 program.
The new program will benefit about 1,200 
teachers and 30,000 pre-K through third-grade students. 
In 2010, the Florida Mas-
ter Teacher Initiative beat 1,700 other teacher devel-opment programs to join about 50 winners, chosen by the U.S. Department of Education, to receive the i3 
$5 million grant. The W.K. Kellogg Foundation also gave $1 million.
Teachers enroll in online courses, conduct 
classroom research projects and work with UF professors-in-residence. Traynor is taking Culturally Responsive Classroom Manage-ment, her second course since the i3 program’s launch in fall. She meets regularly with profes-sor Raquel Diaz.  
“It’s very intensive,” Traynor said. The 
teachers work full-time in addition to partici-pating in the program.
Traynor faces challenges such as a lack 
of family support for students and a lack of technological resources as a teacher at a high-poverty school.

He said Apple is working on 
ways for teachers to use the elec-
tronic textbooks in their curricula and is constantly thinking of ways educators can use tablet comput-ers.
Ed Kellerman, a senior lecturer 
at UF’s William and Grace Dial Center for Written and Oral Com-munication, said he uses video and photo examples in many of his lec-tures.
“We won’t have much of a 
choice as to whether or not to use this technology in the coming years,” Kellerman said.
This summer will be his first 
time teaching his Introduction to Communication Studies class completely online and essentially paper-free. 
He wrote the textbook for his 
introductory course and said he would consider using the iBooks Author program if it were to be-come popular. 
If a complete switch to Apple’s 
interactive textbooks were to oc-cur, textbook retailers could expe-rience some loss of business. Apple offers textbooks at a fraction of the price, according to the company’s website.
Doby Gray, textbook man-
ager at Gator Textbooks Inc. in Gainesville, said he has heard of 
the new Apple textbook pro-gram but does not think it will end the book-store business in the near future. However, he 
said he believes it is important 
to stay aware.
“We are threatened a little bit.

Need to figure out how to get to that bar? 
There’s an app for that. 
Want to update your status about your 
caffeine-fueled study session? There’s one for 
that, too.
There’s even an app for the UF service that 
can take you around campus at night, but most students aren’t using it.
About 13 percent of students who called 
the Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol for nighttime rides on campus used the service’s web-based system. 
SNAP is staffed by students and super -
vised by the University Police Department.
The system, which was established during 
the summer, lets students request rides from smartphones and computers. 
Students can also download an Android 
application that links them to the website. The Android app store showed that the app had been downloaded between 100 and 500 times.
In July, UPD also started using an auto-
mated call-in system to handle requests, said SNAP Coordinator and UPD Officer Gregory Castronover. Students can choose to speak to a person after an initial automated greeting.
Eighteen-year-old history freshman Sarah 
Parker said she uses SNAP a few times a week. One of her friends has the mobile app, she said, so she asks her friend to use the app to request a ride because it’s easier than call-ing.
Requesting SNAP by phone can take about 
a minute, Castronover said, but an online re-quest can be placed in five to ten seconds.
The app is only available for Android 
phones, but he said an Apple app is in the works. 
In the fall, SNAP processed about 29,000 
requests for 47,500 rides. About 3,500 requests were made through the web-based system.
SNAP users can log in with their Gator -
Link information and track the SNAP van as they wait for it to arrive.
If a van has to wait for a person or group, 
the driver calls dispatchers and then the on-line system calls the person who made the request, he said.
Passengers then have two minutes to 
come out to the van, he said, which should cut down on delays.
Parker experienced this when she and her 
friends were unable to make it to the van in two minutes. The group ended up walking home.
“It’s one of those things that you have to 
time right,” she said.
To download the app, those with Android 
phones can scan the QR code at police.ufl.edu or search for “UFL SNAP” at market.an-droid.com. 
Students can also request SNAP by call-
ing 352-392-SNAP or visiting snap.ufl.edu. The service is available every night during the fall and spring semesters from 6:30 p.m. to 3 a.m.Few students using Android application to call SNAP

Spring Break is right around the corner, and cruises are 
being booked as quickly as ever despite the Costa Concor -
dia shipwreck in Italy two weeks ago.
The Costa Concordia, carrying more than 4,200 passen-
gers, capsized off the Tuscan island of Giglio after crashing 
into a reef on Jan. 13. The wreck left 17 people dead, and 15 are still missing. Despite the recent disaster, Florida travel agencies have 
not seen a decrease in business for any cruise line.
John May, owner of Continental Capers Travel and 
Cruises in Gainesville, said he is seeing a lot more sales this year for all cruise lines. 
“We haven’t had any repercussions from it at all,” he 
said. “Sure, everybody knows about it and realized how bad the safety procedures were on that, [but] I haven’t had anybody cancel or even think twice about it.”
According to the Tampa Bay Times, U.S. Coast Guard 
rules state ships must conduct safety drills within 24 hours after leaving a port, which the Concordia did not do.
“It’s a wake-up call for all cruise lines to work on their 
safety practices and the training of their crews,” May said.
Marie Marcano, manager of Kendale Lakes Travel in 
Miami, said the Costa Concordia disaster has not and will not affect the number of people booking cruises. 
“I’ve been telling people that it was something just lo-
cally and something that just one or two people on the ship that did it,” she said. “It’s not industry-wide.”

UF lacrosse ranked in top five
The Gators' women's lacrosse checked in at No. 3 
in the Inside Lacrosse/deBeer Media Preseason Top 25, behind No. 1 Northwestern and No. 2 Maryland. SEC coaches pick Gators to win
Florida's softball team has been picked to win the Southeastern 
Conference, according to a vote of the league's coaches that was released Monday. UF is ranked No. 2 in the NFCA Preseason Top 25. JOE MORGAN
Alligator Staff Writer
Coach Amanda Butler 
admits that the Gators lack 
focus at the free-throw line right now.
However, a concrete so-
lution to Florida’s current slump has eluded the six-year coaching veteran and former UF guard. 
“I’m not sure, it’s kind 
of an individual thing,” she said. “If there’s a way to coach them better from the free-throw line, then I’ll cer -
tainly find it.”
Until the shots start fall-
ing again, the Gators’ only option for improvement has been repetition in practice.
Prior to a film session in 
preparation for Arkansas last week, multiple players were putting up shots from the free-throw line.
Butler has even had UF do 
some work outside of team activities, encouraging her players to practice foul shots on their own.
“We’re getting in the 
gym, and we’re shooting,” sophomore guard Jaterra Bonds said. “It’s all mental. When you get up there, it’s nobody’s fault but yours if you miss it, so it’s a mental thing.”
In its last two contests 
against No. 6 Kentucky and Arkansas, Florida shot just 45 percent from the free-throw line — 21.5 percent off its mark before those games.
After losses to the Wild-
cats and the Razorbacks, the Gators now have seven de-feats by six points or fewer, magnifying the free-throw problem.
Part of the struggles may 
stem from the fact that UF’s last two games have been away from home.
Even though the team is 
in the midst of a three-game road 
trip — its longest of the season — Butler expects the shots to fall 
the same way.
“You’ve just got to be able 
to step up and be mentally tough and hit [free throws], especially in big moments, but really, the whole ball game,” Butler said.
Florida has two days to 
try and get back on track from the charity stripe be-fore playing LSU on the road Thursday night in Baton Rouge, La.
Free throws played a sig-
nificant role in the Gators’ first tilt against the Tigers, a 62-58 win on Jan. 15 in the O’Connell Center.

� HE LEADS SEC WITH FOUR 
FRESHMAN OF THE WEEK AWARDS.
JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Staff Writer
Florida coach Billy Donovan isn’t 
worried about Brad Beal getting 
tired any time soon — at least in his legs.
As the lone freshman in Florida’s 
starting lineup, Beal is leading the Gators in steals, free-throw attempts and defensive rebounds all while scoring 14.1 points per game.
While Donovan has said that too 
much is expected of Beal at times, the 6-foot-3 guard hasn’t seen his playing time decrease six games into UF’s Southeastern Conference schedule. Beal leads Florida with 33.5 minutes played per game, which is also the fourth most in the league.
“Rest hasn’t really been a concern 
with Brad,” Donovan said. “I think the biggest thing that happens to those guys more than anything else is that they get mentally fatigued, and I have yet to see that mental fa-tigue on him, or the physical fatigue. I think right now he’s fine — not to say that couldn’t happen a couple weeks from now. I feel pretty good with where he’s at right now.”
On Monday , Beal was named 
the SEC Freshman of the Week for a league-high fourth time after scor -
ing a combined 28 points in a pair of Florida victories against Ole Miss and Mississippi State.
The only other SEC player who 
has won the award more than once is Kentucky center Anthony Davis,  a three-time freshman of the week who ranks 17th in minutes played.
While Florida is set to face three 
conference teams, including the Wildcats, in six days starting Thurs-day, Beal said the Gators have been able to ready themselves for the gru-eling stretch with tough practices. 
“It was very physical at Ole Miss 
— they’re probably the most physi-cal team we’ve faced,” Beal said. “Mississippi State has a bunch of big guys inside that are really physical, too. We just try to prepare ourselves — we battle each other in practice all of the time — so it’s really our prep-aration for the games.”

END OF GREGULATION
With about eight minutes left and Florida nursing a 
four-point lead, Erving Walker drives the lane. 
As he leaves his feet, Gators fans collectively in-
hale. After three seasons watching Walker at the point, they’re prepared to let out the frustrated groan that has accompanied so many of his turnovers.
What would it be this time?  Would he land for a travel? 
Force up a wild layup that has no hope of cutting through the trees? Dump it off out of bounds? 
On Saturday against Mississippi State, it was none of the above. Walker found Brad Beal slid-ing away from his man and into the weak-side corner, getting him the rock for an easy catch-and-shoot three. 
Over the last five games, those 
plays have become commonplace. 
Florida’s turnover numbers have 
been slashed drastically during its current winning steak, and the Gators’ 
ability to keep that number low will be as critical as any factor in determining the team’s fate. 
Florida is currently tied for fifth in the nation in turnover 
percentage at 16 percent, almost five percentage points below the NCAA average of 20.7. 
But, in the games UF has lost, a barrage of turnovers has led 
to a breakdown of the usually unstoppable offensive machine. 
The four blemishes on Florida’s record were its four worst 
turnover percentage games of the year, ranging from 15 Cutting out turnovers critical to Florida's recent success

Maegan Dennis / Alligator Staffchances backup forward Wal-
ter Pitchford had at seeing playing time this week were derailed when he sprained his right wrist in a scooter crash  Monday.
According to a school re-
port, the accident occurred just north of the intersection of Uni-versity Avenue and 13th Street when Pitchford, a freshman, rolled his scooter while trying to avoid hitting a vehicle in front of him.
The 6-foot-10, 221-pound 
Pitchford also suffered a bad scrape to his arm and is expect-ed to miss 10 days to two weeks with his injuries.
He has played a total of 15 
minutes and scored four points in eight games this season.
Rankings update: Follow-
ing a pair of wins against Ole Miss and Mississippi State, Florida (17-4, 5-1 SEC) moved up two spots to No. 12 in the Associated Press poll this week and made a dramatic 21-spot jump in the NCAA’s RPI stand-ings.
Florida’s RPI is 15th in the 
nation after besting two top-40 teams in the Rebels and Bulldogs. The Gators own the 
SEC’s sec-ond-highest RPI behind 
the Wildcats, who are fifth in the stand-ings. 
No. 1 
K e n t u c k y 
(21-1, 7-0 SEC) maintained its top spot in the AP poll for the second straight week, while Mississippi State (17-5, 4-3 SEC) slid down four spots to No. 22. Vanderbilt (16-5, 5-1 SEC) en-tered the rankings for the first time since Dec. 18 at No. 25.
Contact John Boothe at 
jboothe@alligator.org.Making 9 of 13 foul shots — all 
in the second half — Florida was 
able to hold off a late LSU rally to secure its first home victory in Southeastern Conference play this season.
On the verge of elimination 
from regular-season SEC title con-tention, the Gators would welcome another 69.2 percent clip against the Tigers to help escape their re-cent rut.
According to Butler, Florida re-
turning to its early-season form is a matter of confidence.
“We really have, I don’t think, a 
deficit in that area,” Butler said. 
“Whatever happens is usually 
contagious, especially at the free-throw line. If one person’s hitting, it makes it a little bit easier for the next person to hit it.”

David Carr / Alligator
Coach Amanda Butler is trying to find a cure for her team's free-throw 
struggles. UF has lost two straight games by fewer than six points. 
UF looking to bounce back against LSU
W-HOOPS , from page 14
HOOPS , from page 14Pitchford injured in 
scooter accident
giveaways against Tennessee up to 20 against 
Syracuse. 
Overall, Florida has averaged 17.3 turn-
overs in those losses. 
In the last five outings, the Gators have giv-
en the ball away just 7.8 times per game, three lower than their season average and nearly 10 below the figure they have posted in losses. 
Coach Billy Donovan said the recent surge 
is a result of the team making better decisions and learning how to utilize each other, things that had to develop during the first 15 games. 
Now, the results are starting to show. With six minutes left in Saturday’s first 
half, Beal used a Patric Young screen and then found the big man rolling to the basket with-out a moment’s hesitation, floating a lob his way for an easy two-handed slam. 
Beal has just five turnovers in the last five 
games, a stark contrast from his early-season struggles. After averaging 2.6 giveaways per game during the first 16 games, he has had just one turnover per contest in the last five. This season he has posted five games with five or more turnovers and, not coincidentally, Flori-da has lost four of them. 
To some extent, the same is true for Flor -
ida’s other two primary guards, Walker and Kenny Boynton. Walker has eight games with three or more turnovers this season, and Flori-da has lost four of them. 
Boynton has four games with three or more 
turnovers, and UF has lost three of them. 
While turnovers are obviously critical in 
and of themselves, they have also affected other areas of UF’s game. To take stat-nerdiness to the next level, the 
correlation between turnovers and shooting percentage for UF is minus-.47. That means that as UF’s turnover count has gone up, there’s been a moderate relationship to shoot-ing percentage going down. 
This makes sense, given that turnovers 
break up the flow of the game and take UF’s many talented shooters out of their rhythm. 
With so many weapons, all Florida needs 
to do is keep limiting giveaways to have a shot at a deep tournament run.
