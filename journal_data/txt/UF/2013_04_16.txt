Gator Dining Services 
recently announced Pollo 
Tropical, along with Burger 
King and Papa John’s, will 
start accepting meal plans in Fall 2013.
A total of 10 locations in-
cluding the Fresh Food Com-pany, Gator Corner Dining Center, Moe’s Southwest Grill, Pollo Tropical, Papa John’s, Burger King, Chomp 
It, Croutons, Home Zone and 
the Camellia Court Café will accept residential, commut-er, and faculty and staff meal 
plans, Marketing Program 
Manager for Gator Dining Services Jill Rodriguez wrote in an email.
“Based on the positive 
feedback we received when we added Moe’s Southwest Grill and Chomp It, we de-cided to add more locations for added value and conve-nience for meal plan partici-
pants,” she said.
Rodriguez said meal plans 
can be redeemed one lunch a 
day for ﬁ  ve days a week at 
Pollo Tropical, Papa John’s, 
Croutons, Home Zone, Camellia Court Café and Chomp It. 
One dinner a day can 
be redeemed four days per week at those ﬁ  ve locations, excluding the Camellia Court 
Café.
She said the plan also al-
lows for one meal for dinner 
daily after 4 p.m. at Burger King or Moe’s Southwest 
Grill.
Spencer Smud, a 22-year-
old UF recreation program-
ming senior, said students 
will take advantage of the 
expansion.
He particularly likes Pollo Tropical.
“I feel that a lot of students 
do end up passing by the Reitz, but now that they’ve made more commercialized eateries included, it’ll at-tract more people to the meal 
plan,” he said.
The seven-day open ac-
cess meal plan for Fall costs 
$1,896, according to the Gator 
1 Central website. The ﬁ  ve-
day open access meal plan for Fall costs $1,887.

Explosions at the ﬁ  nish line of 
the Boston Marathon on Monday 
killed three people and injured about 150 — but local partici-pants were not among them.
“As far as we know, all of 
the runners from Gainesville are safe and accounted for,” said Meredith DeFranco, a doctor of physical therapy at Shands at UF who ﬁ  nished her fourth Boston Marathon about an hour before the bombs went off.
Twenty Gainesville residents 
were among the about 27,000 people registered for the race, according to the 2013 Boston Marathon website.
The blasts occurred at about 
2:45 p.m., scattering screaming runners and spectators. Build-ings shook; windows broke. Bright bloodstains on the side-
walk emerged as the smoke 
cleared.
UF public relations alumna Michaela Trimble, now a global marketing communications and advertising graduate student at Emerson College, said her entire apartment jolted after the ﬁ  rst explosion.
“Then I heard the second 
one,” she said. “And then, I heard people screaming.”
Trimble watched as custom-
ers evacuated from bars and restaurants. The streets were chaotic.
The scene looked unreal to 
Michelle Adams, who had turned on the television after getting out 
of her hotel room’s shower.
“I thought it was a movie,” 
the Gainesville Health and Fit-
ness Center personal trainer wrote in an email. “I had just come through there, and that was not what it looked like.”
Authorities dubbed the in-
cident a terrorist attack as the 
day wore on. As of press time, 
they were not sure whether the bombs were foreign or domestic, Gainesville runners safe after Boston Marathon

◗THE BIKE RIDE WAS 15 
MILES.

The cyclists lined up on Turling-
ton Plaza — one foot on the pedal, 
the other on the ground waiting to 
push off. When they heard, “Let’s 
go!” they took off smiling.
Team Florida, a UF student-run 
cycling club, led a 15-mile memo-
rial bike ride celebrating Michael 
R. Edmonds Jr., a UF student who took his life and fell from Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium on April 15, 2012.
Edmonds, 26, came to UF in 
2011 as a journalism major, and struggled with depression and bi-polar disorder.
Neal Shepherd, a 19-year-old 
UF applied physiology and kinesi-ology senior and Team Florida vice president, said the ride brought back memories of a previous race 
he participated in shortly after Ed-
monds’ death.
Last year, Shepherd learned 
about the news a week before the Collegiate Individual Omnium 
Conference Championships. Shep-
herd won a medal at the race and buried it with Edmonds’ ashes.
“He was talking about confer-
ence for the longest time, and it was devastating to not have him there,” Shepherd said. “I felt it was impor-tant to give him a piece of what he missed.”

Ron Paul speaks to students and Gainesville residents Monday at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center. 
He was hosted by Accent Speaker’s Bureau and spoke about the political economic situation.
◗ HE WAS PAID $55,000.
COLLEEN WRIGHT

Ron Paul sung the libertarian 
battle hymn of individual liber-
ties and property rights Monday night.
Accent Speaker’s Bureau 
brought the former Texas rep-resentative to the Stephen C. O’Connell Center. He was paid $55,000 by Accent to speak.
Paul spoke to a crowd of 2,062, 
according to Accent’s Director of Press Relations Lisa Jardim.
He centered his libertar-
ian message around college stu-
dents, touching on subjects like 
the growing deficit, marriage equality and the war on drugs. He made his point clear that if liberty was precious, it had to be inclusive.“I’m delighted to find so many 
young people so interested in an issue that’s so important to all of us: the cause of liberty,” Paul said.
Accent Chairman Josh Holtz-
man asked Paul questions from the Student Body after the speech. 
The questions included topics 
ranging from his thoughts on concealed weapons on campus to his proudest achievement.
”My proudest achievement is 
being well received on college campuses,” he said.
Maxim Dolinsky, standing 
proud in his Ron Paul shirt, said 
he was excited Paul came to a lib-
eral school like UF.
“He doesn’t need to edu-
cate libertarians as much as the individuals around here,” the 27-year-old UF second-year fi-nance Ph.D. student said.

Voting for the Gainesville mayoral runoff 
election is today. Polls will be open from 7 
a.m. to 7 p.m.
Former District 2 City Commissioner Ed 
Braddy will face off against incumbent May-
or Craig Lowe for the mayor’s seat.
In the March 19 election, Braddy received 
4,649 votes, or about 38 percent of the vote, 
while Lowe received 4,418 votes, or about 37 percent of the vote.
During last week’s early-voting period, 
1,140 ballots were cast, 62 more than in March, said Alachua County Supervisor of Elections Pam Carpenter. As of Monday af-ternoon, more than 3,500 absentee ballots were cast, down from more than 4,000 during the March election.
In the 2010 mayoral runoff elections, 
12,204 total votes were cast with a 16.77 per-cent turnout.
At the polls, UF students and Gainesville 
residents are required to present a current and valid picture and signature identification before voting or casting a provisional ballot.
UF students who live on campus can vote 
at the Reitz Union. Other places to vote on campus include the Phillips Center for the 
Performing Arts, Doyle Conner Building and 
the Florida Museum of Natural History.

The U.S. Postal Service’s latest plan to 
regain financial stability by cutting Satur-
day deliveries has been blocked by Con-gress.
Although the post office hoped to 
implement the new schedule Aug. 5, the passing of Congress’ Continuing Resolu-tion bill forced the post office to concede.
Stephen Seewoester, spokesman for 
the post office’s North Florida branch, de-clined to comment on the effect it would have on Florida’s post offices. He did say because the decision came from the post office’s Board of Governors, it would ap-
ply to offices statewide.
According to the statement from the 
U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors, 
which controls the executive operations of the postal service, the agency said they would continue to look for support for a new delivery schedule or other ways to increase revenue.
Carl Williams, senior postal manager 
of the UF Mail Distribution Center, said changing the delivery schedule wouldn’t have affected mail services on campus.
“We would still have been delivering 
mail to the students anyways,” he said. “It’s just a normal day for us.”
Luke Lottman, a 20-year-old UF sports 
management junior, said the new deliv-
ery schedule wouldn’t have made a big 
difference to him.
“You already know it’s closed on 
Sunday,” he said. “Obviously it’s nice if they’re open all the time, but you just have to plan around it.”You’ve got mail on Saturdays

“I don’t know when those bombs were there,” Trimble 
said. “I could have ran right past them the day before. I 
know I walked past them earlier today. . . it sickens me a little bit.”
Bostonians and visitors alike were “shocked, stunned 
and sad,” said UF biological scientist Mark Ou.
“It’s just incredibly sad that people get hurt on such a 
day when people are celebrating,” he said.
Former Gators cross country runners Jeremy Criscione 
and Matt Hensley and their families were OK, wrote Uni-versity Athletic Association spokeswoman Amanda Brooks in an email. She said they were the only Gator athletes who she knew participated in the marathon.
“It was very tragic,” Hensley wrote in a Facebook mes-
sage. “My thoughts and prayers go out to the friends and 
family that were in the area.”
Despite the hotel lockdowns, uncertainty of Florida-
bound flights and waves of bad news that seem to keep com-
ing, the Gators and Gainesville residents remained hopeful.
Boston will bounce back stronger, Ou said, likening the 
situation to 9/11.
DeFranco said it’s important the marathon continues 
next year in memory of the injured and deceased.
“Runners are resilient,” she said. “The American people 
are resilient.”

ed an additional fundraiser after the ride, donating a dollar for ev-ery beer purchased.
Chelsea Factor, a 22-year-old 
UF applied physiology and kine-
siology senior who organized the 
memorial ride, said she chose the location because she had visited the bar with Edmonds and the team a few times.
Last year, Edmonds’ sister, 
Karen, led the memorial ride. This year, she ran the Boston Marathon 
in honor of her brother.
She taped a picture of them on 
her race bib and posted it on Fa-
cebook with the words, “I’m run-
ning for you today, brother bear.”
A few hours later, two bombs 
struck near the finish line.
Michael and Karen’s uncle, Ste-
ven Warren, announced in tears at the memorial that Karen was safe 
and finished the marathon in three hours, 16 minutes and 59 seconds.
Tony Delisle, who taught Ed-
monds’ personal and family health class last year, spoke to the riders before they took off.
“I knew Mike as a student, but 
he quickly became my teacher 
because he wore his heart on his 
sleeve, was unafraid about show-ing his emotions — he never hesi-tated to give a second of his time 
to someone in need,” he said. “I 
am very sad of his passing, and a tear to my eye is never that far away when I think about him.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, APRIL 16, 2013

Exotic pet owners will be able to turn in their exotic pets for 
free without facing any penalties at the first local Exotic Pet Am-
nesty Day today on campus.
“It is an alternative to turning something loose with no 
questions asked,” said Steve Johnson, an associate professor of wildlife ecology with UF’s Department of Wildlife Ecology and Conservation.
The department is hosting the event in collaboration with 
the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission from 
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Straughn IFAS Extension Professional 
Development Center located on 2142 Shealy Drive.
Johnson said when some people get rid of their pets, they 
release their animals into the wild, causing an increase in non-
native animals in Florida.
Some of these animals have negative effects on the environ-
ment, he said. Several species in the past have caused a decline 
in other animal populations.
Last year, 297 animals such as lizards, snakes and turtles 
were turned it to the FWC at Exotic Pet Amnesty Day events, said Diane Hirth, FWC habitat and species conservation com-munications coordinator.
“Normally, what we receive are animals that are not com-
monly sold in pet stores and not very expensive,” she said.
Johnson said the department will also be having educational 
outreach tables at the Reitz Union on the same day, where stu-
dents can learn more about how to be responsible pet owners.
“It’s free, open to the public and we are just trying to do 
good for the environment,” he said.Event hopes to attract

In celebration of Pride Awareness Month, comedi-
an and gay rights advocate Sarah Silverman will make 
a pit stop at UF on April 22 as part of her comedy 
tour.
Best known for her Comedy Central series “The 
Sarah Silverman Program,” which earned her a Primetime Emmy Award nomination, Silverman was also in the Oscar-nominated animated film “Wreck-
it-Ralph.”
Hosted by Accent Speaker’s Bureau, Pride Aware-
ness Month and Student Government Productions, Silverman will be paid $50,000.
The free program starts at 8 p.m. at the Phillips 
Center for the Performing Arts. Doors open at 7 p.m.
Students can pick up tickets with a Gator 1 Card at 
the Phillips Center Box Office beginning Friday.
Accent chairman Josh Holtzman said any leftover 
tickets will be distributed to the general public at 7 p.m. the day of the show, although he did not expect there to be many remaining tickets. 
However, unlike prior Accent shows, only one 
ticket will be distributed per person. This is in re-
sponse to the sold-out Neil deGrasse Tyson show earlier this month, said Holtzman, a 22-year-old UF political science and history senior.
“I’m excited,” he said. “It’s going 
to be hilarious.”
Silverman was chosen because she 
is a controversial, entertaining come-
dian who is an outspoken advocate 
for gay rights, Holtzman said.
Jessie Pincus, executive director for Pride Aware-
ness Month, said having Silverman come to UF is an 
honor.
Pincus, a 22-year-old UF advertising senior, said 
she hopes this event would bring people together who are outside of the LGBT community.
“When you compare comedy and real issues at 
hand, I think people listen better,” she said.

Gainesville Police is looking for 
a man who allegedly stole various 
items from two UF students and 
sexually assaulted one of the stu-
dents at gunpoint early Monday.
At about 4 a.m., the man 
walked into the house, located in 
the 400 block of Southwest 10th 
Street, through an unlocked back door. Inside, he sexually assaulted the woman while threatening her with a handgun, said GPD spokes-
man Officer Ben Tobias.Police said the man also stole 
two MacBook Pro laptops, an iP-
hone and other personal items, 
then he fled from the house, ac-
cording to a GPD news release.
The woman and her male room-
mate called University Police’s non-emergency number, accord-ing to a UPD report. UPD trans-
ferred the call to GPD’s emergen-
cy system and officers drove to the house.
Police described the assail-
ant to be a 6-foot-tall thin, black man wearing a gray sweatshirt with black jeans and black wrap-around sunglasses, according to 
the release.
Officers searched the area 
around the house but couldn’t 
find the man, police said. How-
ever, a neighbor told officers the 
man may have walked west on Southwest Seventh Avenue after the incident.
GPD is still investigating the 
case and requests that anyone with information call GPD detectives at 352-393-7670, text an anonymous tip to 274637 with keyword “GP-
DFL” plus your tip or by calling 
the anonymous tip line at 352-393-7700.

Gainesville Regional Transit 
System has added three new 
hybrid buses to its on-campus routes.
Last week, riders of the 118 
Park-and-Ride were met with two new orange-and-blue hybrid 
buses. The third bus was added to the 120 Fraternity Row route, 
bringing the number of hybrid-electric buses in Gainesville to five.
RTS got the new buses in February and started running them on routes April 1. 
The two other hybrids, 
currently running on Route 46 
from UF to downtown, were 
added to the fleet in July.
The hybrid-electric buses are 
the newest eco-friendly additions to a fleet that already uses 
biodiesel on its 116 buses, said 
RTS spokesman Chip Skinner.
“The hybrid battery power 
really helps us to increase fuel 
efficiency and emissions,” he 
said.
Skinner said these buses 
are similar to hybrid systems in passenger cars because they 
switch to an energy-saving idle 
mode until demand for the gas engine is increased.
“Much like a passenger hybrid 
car, you don’t see as much of a fuel savings at higher speeds because the electric engine isn’t kicking in as often,” Skinner said. “On campus, it’s more stop-and-
go traffic, so we’re hoping to see 
a greater fuel savings in the long term by keeping them there.”
Both types of buses are 40 feet 
long and hold 72 passengers. However, they differ in miles per gallon and cost.
Skinner said the current 
biodiesel buses get about four to six miles per gallon. 
The hybrid buses get about 15 
percent to 20 percent better gas mileage than their non-hybrid 
counterparts. 
The second difference is the 
price tag. 
RTS’ regular biodiesel buses 
cost $400,000, and each hybrid bus costs $600,000.
The addition of these eco-
friendly buses has piqued interest 
in students on the UF campus.
“I’ve ridden it several times 
and prefer it over the regular buses,” said 22-year-old UF advertising senior Qitan Huang. “It’s quieter and smoother, 
especially at the back of the bus 
where the exhaust is.”
UF mechanical engineer 
graduate student John Loeffler 
is concerned about the long-term 
cost of maintaining the hybrid system.
“They’re actually very 
inefficient,” he said. “Eventually, 
they’re going to have to replace 
the batteries, and they’re extremely expensive.”
Loeffler said hybrids may 
not be as eco-friendly as they appear.
“It also costs a lot of petroleum 
to actually manufacture one of these batteries,” he said.TUESDAY, APRIL 16, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

UF’s Levin College of Law Black 
Law Students Association was rec-
ognized as the national chapter of the year at the annual National Black Law Students Association Convention in 
Atlanta. UF Law’s association beat 
about 200 other groups and received the NBLSA’s highest award and hon-or given to any chapter, according to a press release.
The association’s negotiations team 
also won first place in the internation-al negotiation competition.
Atiya Munroe, a 28-year-old UF 
second-year law student and mem-ber of the negotiations team, said she 
and her partner, Laselve Harrison, a 
24-year-old UF second-year law stu-dent, were given a situation that had occurred internationally.
Munroe said the team negotiates 
with another team to meet the goals the client in their situation had.
She said it was a great feeling to 
see the team’s hard work over the past 
several months pay off.  
Brandon Campbell, a 24-year-old 
UF second-year law student and presi-
dent of the association, said the award shows UF produces well-rounded students and the law school is at a transition point.
“We are a law school that believes 
in and uplifts diversity,” he said.UF Law group wins top

A recent ranking placed 
Gainesville among the top 10 
small college cities, coming in at No. 4 behind Ann Arbor, Madison and Boulder.
“This ranking highlights 
the strengths of Gainesville, feeding off two of the top pub-lic institutions of higher educa-tion in the country, University of Florida and Santa Fe Col-lege,” said Jordan Meyer, di-rector of communications and marketing for the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce and Council for Economic Outreach. 
The American Institute 
for Economic Research pub-lished the report as part of the 2012-2013 College Desti-nations Index. It analyzed the top U.S. towns and cities for college students based on 12 criteria such as cost of living, entrepreneurial activity and research capacity, according to a Gainesville Area Chamber press release.
UF spokesman Steve Or-
lando attributed UF’s reputa-tion as a top public research university to Gainesville’s placement.
“The university is part of a 
vibrant, creative class econo-my,” he said.
Randi Hall, a 20-year-old 
UF economics and sociology junior, said since moving to Gainesville, she has appreci-ated the city’s diverse culture.
“On an average weekend 
there can be an NCAA cham-pionship at stake, an art festi-val downtown ...  or a cultural event that pools all walks of life together in one place,” she said.
Orlando added the shared 
Gator spirit among residents and students creates a tight-knit community that draws students and visitors from across the county as well as the world.
“All of these pieces togeth-
er is what makes Gainesville a great college town,” he said.
Gainesville ranked No. 4 town
“We are a law school that 
believes in and uplifts diversity.”

Roomie retrospective: don’t fear the random
As the end of the semester rolls around, everyone 
seems to be getting serious cabin fever about their living situations.
People moving from residence halls to apartments 
say, “I can’t wait until I have my own bathroom!” Peo-
ple moving from old roommates to new roommates say, 
“I can’t wait until I’m not woken up by her hair dryer at 8 in the morning!”
Let’s give ourselves some credit. Sharing living 
space with people is a wild adventure of innumerable outcomes, and it can be a hard thing to learn straight off the bat.
We go straight from 18 years of living with our loving 
family into a contractual-style agreement with someone 
we may or may not have known before, then we walk 
into the room that will be our home for the next nine months.
That is a pretty big jump, so what happens from 
there on out is anyone’s guess. In a school of more than 50,000 people, if someone compiled all of the stories UF students had to say about their roommates, I bet it would be a pretty zany saga of the good, the bad and the crazy.
So, for another year of student living down, let’s all 
give ourselves a pat on the back.
The thing that always strikes me as odd is some-
times people will choose to live with other people they know, but not necessarily like, over living with a ran-domly chosen dorm or apartment mate — they ﬁ  nd the thought of living with someone they have never met too uncomfortable.
They would prefer a roommate they only have the 
vaguest connection to over closing their eyes and spin-ning the wheel of chance.
For me, it’s the exact opposite. For the two years I 
have lived in the residence halls, I have felt more conﬁ  -dent living with someone I have never met before than living with any friend or acquaintance that came to UF with me. The more random, the better.
I actually chose my freshman-year roommate solely on the basis that she was the only one on the ﬂ  oor who didn’t have a Facebook account.
So far, I can’t complain on 
my methodology because the 
girls I have lived with up to 
this point have all been abso-lute sweethearts.
On the ﬂ  ip side of my expe-
riences though, I’ve had friends 
who have lived with randomly chosen roommates, and they end up quietly despising each other for the remain-der of the school year. 
But in my mind, I would rather end up hating liv-
ing with a random roommate than end up hating living with a friend because in the ﬁ  rst scenario, you haven’t lost anything by the end of it.
Having randomly selected roommates teaches you a 
lot about how to live with really different sorts of peo-ple, which is a pretty essential life skill. Even though you may not ever live with those people again, you will have to coexist with similar types of people eventually, either in classes or at work.
Most importantly, I think it teaches people how to 
roll with the punches.
Sure, there will be the good and the bad, but after the 
year is over, you can just look back on it with friends and tell stories and laugh about it. Or, if your expe-rience was beyond a joking matter, at least you have learned what you never want in a roommate again, and hopefully, you will have better luck next time.
College and the few years after is the only compact 
time we get to try out new living arrangements with various types of places and various types of people.
Being fearless about the journey helps to test your 
limits, to expand your experiences and to come away with some great stories, which are possibly the best parts of college.

at UF. Her column runs on Tuesdays.Aubrey Plaza: 
Blame it on the 
alcohol?
Publicity stunts are pretty weird. They’re even weirder when they don’t really work, like, at all. We’re talking to you, Aubrey Plaza.
For those of you who are actual adults, you probably didn’t 
watch the “MTV Movie Awards” on Sunday. The most exciting 
part, according to the Internet, wasn’t even an actual moment 
from the awards show. That moment was “The Hunger Games” preview for “Catching Fire.”
Plaza’s small stint during the awards show is one of the only 
things people are talking about — besides Perez Hilton’s outﬁ  t.
She spent her time “bum-rushing the stage in the middle of 
Will Ferrell’s acceptance speech for his Comedic Genius Golden Popcorn award,” according to Us Weekly. “In the bizarre bit, the 28-year-old ‘Parks and Recreation’ actress hopped on the stage, 
barefoot, and grabbed Ferrell’s statue.”
How much of it was planned? How much of it was Ferrell in 
on beforehand? Once she left the stage, Ferrell said, according 
to a USA Today article, “Aubrey Plaza, everyone. Just like we rehearsed it. Perfect, it was perfect. Not too long, not too short. Right on the money.”
He honestly didn’t seem to be very in on the joke, however.Was this entirely unexpected, though? During another MTV 
awards ceremony, Kanye West infamously interrupted Taylor 
Swift’s acceptance speech.
“In 2009, comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, in his guise as ﬂ  am-
boyantly gay fashion reporter Bruno, dropped from the ceil-
ing and landed his crotch in the face of rapper Eminem,” said a Los Angeles Times article. “Eminem seemed to not be in on the stunt and got visibly upset, storming out of the auditorium. But Eminem later admitted that he was in on the stunt from the beginning. And writer Scott Aukerman also admitted to having orchestrated the event.”
According to MTV and its ofﬁ  cial timeline of events, Plaza 
was escorted out of the event during the next commercial break. When she got back to her seat after the incident, she knocked over whatever was in her cup. Luckily, Ferrell wasn’t too upset by what happened. Plus, we don’t think he takes many things seriously because he wore a suit with a money pattern on it to the awards show.
“I think she wanted to tell me something important, but there 
was no message,” Ferrell later joked backstage to MTV, accord-
ing to Us Weekly. “It was just a lot of hot liquor breath. And, 
then, and a little bit of sweat. And then she ran away. But the ship sailed on.”
“MTV News” conﬁ  rmed the event was not pre-planned. So this ended up being just a terrible misstep made by Plaza? 
She tweeted her thanks to Kanye afterwards, but that doesn’t mean her interruption went off as well as his did.
She wrote #TheToDoList across her chest in some sort of 
marker, but we don’t think anyone noticed that bit of informa-
tion because we were all so busy trying to ﬁ  gure out what she 
was actually doing.
She did it during a not-very-popular awards show, and she’s 
normally very collected as an individual.
Don’t mess up your sweet “Parks and Recreation” gig, girl.

CITF a necessity 
Dear Gators,
As the current Student Body 
president at the University of Florida, I am calling on your much-needed support. 
The current legislative session 
is three weeks from ending, and I am extremely worried about the future of two of our most prominent buildings on campus: Newell Hall and the J. Wayne Reitz Union. The Capital Im-provement Trust Fund fee was speciﬁ  cally created in 1988 to be 
bonded every four years for non-
academic student life buildings on campus. 
The next ﬁ  scal year is one of 
these years when CITF funds that have been collected from students should be appropriated for student-approved projects at the donor universities. 
The Florida Senate, however, 
has not authorized bonding of these student fees for capital proj-
ects, as of now. 
Although I understand the im-
portance of carefully considering 
any policy that may increase the state debt, it is important to note that the CITF fees are collected from students for this purpose. 
The debt is then serviced from 
the fees themselves and does not 
require general revenue or other 
sales tax dollars to service. 
The two projects in question 
are the expansion and renovation of the Reitz Union and the reno-vation of the third-oldest building on campus, Newell Hall, to open its use as a student study center — a “library without books.” 
If these fees are not bonded 
out, UF students would lose a combined $23 million for both of 
these projects. 
Most alarming, these cuts 
would cripple our Union expan-sion by cutting $10 million from 
the total budget of the $75 million project. 
Furthermore, the renovation 
and repurpose of Newell Hall, currently vacant in the heart of campus, would not see the light of day. 
The J. Wayne Reitz Union was 
created in 1967 for a student pop-ulation of 20,000 people. Now, the Union gets that 
same foot trafﬁ  c every day. 
Students have been ﬁ  ghting 
for the Union renovation project for eight years, and now, we need your help to cross the ﬁ  nish line. 
We need you, the Gator Na-
tion, to voice your support in the Florida Senate to help get these projects through the legislature with the necessary bonding au-thorization. 
Please call and email your 
senator and Senate leadership to show support for such iconic buildings and the need to bond out student CITF fees to make these dreams become a reality. 
On behalf of all 50,000 current 
students and any future students at the University of Florida, we 
thank you for your support and 
will always remember the legacy you will leave.
If you have any questions, 
comments or concerns, please email me at president@sg.uﬂ  .edu. 
For more information on the 
projects, visit www.sg.uﬂ  .edu/
CITF. To contact your senator 
and Senate leadership today, please go to www.ﬂ  senate.gov/Senators/Find.
Thank you again, and as al-
ways, go Gators!

White coat responsibility
Between the sidewalk en-
trance of Shands at UF and a few steps past the 20-foot limit of the next no-smoking sign is one of the remaining havens for 
smokers to puff gray haze into 
the air. 
I pass this area ﬁ  ve times a 
week and, without fail, see in-dividuals of generations past fading in their wheelchairs with 
attached IV towers handling 
their last packs. I pass by scrubs with long faces holding their hand and lit cigarette inside the trash can to avoid suspicion and judgment.Yet, none of these images 
have stirred me as much as the individual in a white coat 
this week at the corner, pufﬁ  ng 
away carefree across the street from the cancer hospital.
I could not stare for too long 
because such a shameful sight grew too heavy. As a medical student who recently received a white coat, I respect the respon-sibility and trust it symbolizes. 
At Shands at UF, white coats 
are not exclusive to current and future physicians.
Pharmacists, nurse practitio-
ners and laboratory research-ers can all wear the white coat. Heck, anyone can even walk into the bookstore and buy one. You need no certiﬁ  cation or 
good intent to wear one.
But that smoker’s profession 
does not matter.
The harm done is equally the 
same. 
Think of the pregnant wom-
an who passes by a staff mem-
ber posing as a chimney on her way for a checkup. Think of her 
school-aged children who come 
with her and see a white coat endorsing the production of gray clouds. 
Think of the cancer patient 
who was recently diagnosed and passes by this ﬂ  eshed oxy-moron on the way to the bus. One can come up with numer-
ous scenarios where it is inap-
propriate to allow a person in a white coat to emulate the be-havior of a 1940s pro-tobacco ad.
Let this serve as a reminder 
for all of us who wear or will wear the white coat to do so in a professional manner with non-maleﬁ  cence. 
Let us join in reason and call 
attention to the smoking prob-lem still on the sidewalks in front of campus, especially the hospital.
As Simon & Garfunkel once 
said, “Silence like a cancer grows.”

Irreligion is on the 
rise in the United States.
Last year, the Pew 
Research Center re-
ported 1 in 5 Ameri-
cans doesn’t ascribe to any religion. Of the “nones,” 88 percent said they weren’t look-ing to adopt a faith ei-ther. With words like “atheist” and “agnostic” coming more and more into style, I wonder what kind of 
image people have when they hear 
or say those words. I’m sure many have an image of grumpy people who hate God. But most atheists I know and interact with are nothing like that. I ﬁ  nd most are people who have a very strong sense of morality and social justice — they just hap-pen to not believe in any gods.
Perhaps the perception of 
grumpiness stems from the fact that the word atheist is a negative description of belief. Many atheists, instead, prefer to label themselves as “secular humanists” — people who simply believe in the well-being of humanity without belief in any gods. According to the Humanist 
Manifesto III of the American Hu-
manist Association, “Humanism is a progressive philosophy of life that, without supernaturalism, afﬁ  rms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulﬁ  llment that aspire to the greater good of hu-manity.”
With the number of people who 
identify as humanist always grow-ing, it is a wonder to me there is no humanist organization at UF.
In the interest of promoting hu-
manist values and advocating for secular humanists on campus, I pro-pose one be established. This will require a core of students who want to see that sort of organization on 
campus.
A humanist organization on campus would mean 
the establishment of a place where peo-ple who want to see positive social change 
could meet up and 
discuss the problems that humanity faces and conceive solutions to those problems. A humanist organization 
on campus would mean the creation of a community of people who are excited by science and reason, who 
feel a tingle when they consider the 
stars. 
Aside from that, a secular hu-
manist organization on campus would mean the creation of a ﬁ  xture — something that would inﬂ  uence the lives of others once we’ve left UF. Many humanists believe fulﬁ  l-ment comes from humane participa-
tion in society, so a secular humanist 
organization on campus would be engaged in charity and service.
I can recall the happiness I felt be-
ing surrounded by people who were as enthusiastic about science, reason and the well-being of humanity as I am at the Accent Speaker’s Bureau event featuring Neil deGrasse Ty-
son. I think it would be great if that 
feeling of community could be rec-reated on campus.
This coming academic year is the 
perfect year for a humanist organi-zation to debut on campus. The lon-ger we wait, the less time we spend pursuing human well-being and advocating for those who want it. In 
the words of Carl Sagan, “If we are 
not committed to our own survival, who will be?”
If you or any UF students you 
know would be interested in doing something, in creating an organiza-tion like that, please join the event or contact me at the email above.

Students planning on hitting the gym to-
day might want to bike instead.
A new study by Australian Epidemiolo-
gist Takemi Sugiyama shows that commut-
ing by bike can be healthier than regular ex-ercise.
The four-year, 882-person study found 
that people who biked to work gained less weight, on average, than those who commut-ed by car and exercised regularly.
Alex Radulescu is one UF student who 
bikes to campus.
“I used to do stationary biking and weight 
lifting but currently not so much,” said the 18-year-old electrical engineering sopho-more.
Radulescu said he lives about a half mile 
from campus, but said he would still bike even if he lived further away.
“It’s a healthy way for people to stay fit,” 
he said. “Biking is awesome.”
Assistant professor Norman Lewis also bikes to UF every day.  He said he lives 2 miles from campus and bikes in the rain or shine.
“I love biking, I always have,” Lewis said. 
“I have been biking since I was about 7 or 8.”
Lewis and Radulescu aren’t alone. A 
study conducted in 2003 by UF found that 
8 percent of UF faculty, staff and students 
biked to campus. 
Another UF study in 2004 found that 
about 13 percent of students biked to school.
Lewis said biking can be enjoyable with 
a lot of benefits, but bicyclists do need to be 
cautious and safe.
“A bicyclists has to obey the law,” he said. 
“I stop at all red lights and stop signs.”
Lewis said biking keeps him young.
“I can still run 5 miles. As long as I [bike], 
I’ll stay young and act young,” he said.Commuters may want to ride their bicycle, study shows

Some students will be ditching 
their shoes and navigating campus 
in their bare feet today.
UF’s TOMS Campus Club is 
hosting One Day Without Shoes from noon to 2 p.m. on the Plaza of the Americas.
“One Day Without Shoes is a 
national event that was started by the TOMS shoes company, and it is meant to raise awareness about children’s health and education by going one day without our own shoes,” said UF TOMS President 
Emily Dhondt, a 20-year-old UF 
advertising junior.
Samantha Wright, the former club president, said it is a simple 
way to help spread the word about 
TOMS’ mission and introduce peo-ple to the hardships others face.
“Many of the individuals that 
TOMS donates to have never owned a pair of shoes, and every day, they are forced to walk great distances or step on sharp objects in their bare feet,” said the 21-year-old UF family, youth and commu-nity sciences senior.
The first 50 participants will 
receive coupons for $5 off a pair of TOMS at Gifthorse. There will also be a raffle for a $50 gift card to Gifthorse for anyone who comes out without their shoes.
Shannon Hill, a 19-year-old UF

Inside the office of the Sid 
Martin Biotechnology Incubator, 
balloons ornament silk trees, vas-es full of flowers embellish the desks and “Congratulations!” fill the hallways.
Sid Martin is one of UF’s busi-
ness incubators, and last week, it was recognized as the best incu-bator in the world.
The National Business Incuba-
tor Association distributed the 
awards at its 27th International Conference of Business Incuba-
tion in Boston.
Like a prenatal baby or new-
born chick not ready for the world, an incubator provides the support and nourishment a new company needs.
As a biotechnology incuba-tor, Sid Martin supplies wet labs, multifaceted laboratories capable of analyzing or testing chemicals, drugs or other biological matter. 
They can cost hundreds of 
thousands of dollars, said Sid Martin’s Associate Director Patti 
Breedlove.
The Randall M. Whaley In-
cubator of the Year award is 
given by the association to the most successful, supportive and all around best incubator in the world.
Many companies supported 
by Sid Martin felt the win was a 
long time coming, but Breedlove 
was less sure.
“I felt pretty discouraged 
when we found out the other fi-nalist was a huge company in Hong Kong,” she said. “I thought we didn’t have a chance.”
Merrie Shaw, the incubator 
manager, was Sid Martin’s repre-
sentative in Boston. 
She had learned the Hong 
Kong incubator was government 
funded, and if it won, it would be a huge honor for all of China.
But Hong Kong didn’t win.“All of sudden, I heard, ‘The 
winner is UF Sid Martin!’” Shaw said.
They announced Sid Martin 
had raised more than $800 mil-lion in funding, to which Shaw politely corrected.
“When I said it was over one 
billion, people clapped and stood up.”
The UF incubator is a 40,000-square-foot facility locat-ed in Alachua, about 25 minutes from campus.
At this time, the incubator 
houses nine companies and sup-ports 14 outside of its walls. 
On average, it produces an-
nual economic impact of about $100 million for Alachua County, Breedlove said.
“Companies apply, but not ev-
eryone is accepted,” she said. “If they are accepted, then almost all of our resources are available to them.”
Acceptance brings access to 
lab equipment, seminars and net-working opportunities for one year, which is all included in one price. 
If a company wants to stay an-
other year, it must reapply.
Banyan Biomarkers, which has 
an office in the building, is the first company to give a blood test 
and, 30 minutes later, be able to 
determine if someone has a mild, moderate or serious concussion. 
The U.S. military provides 
about 80 percent of its funding. Also, the research is currently be-ing tested on the UF football team and women’s lacrosse team.
Kelly Smith, head of Pasteuria 
Bioscience Inc., said the company wouldn’t exist without the incu-bator.
“At the time [we began], we 
had a very small amount of start-up money. It was really only enough to support us in the incu-
bator,” she said. UF’s business incubator awarded ‘best in the world’

 Florida has been through 
baseball hell and back.
  It began when starting cen-
terﬁ  elder Tyler Thompson left 
the team for personal reasons in January. Things worsened as No. 2 starting pitcher Karsten Whit-
son had season-ending shoulder 
surgery in February. 
  Seven losses in its ﬁ  rst 10 
games and a home sweep by Florida Gulf Coast left Florida in 
an embarrassing rut. 
  Nothing could go right. One-
run defeats piled on as did the 
injuries. Shortstop and now cen-
terﬁ  elder Richie Martin missed 
16 games with a fractured ﬁ  nger. Two relievers, Keenan Kish and Corey Stump, had seasons end early due to surgeries. It was 
anemic hitting one game and 
poor pitching the next.
  Nearly two months later the 
Gators (19-18) face the Eagles (20-12) tonight at 6:30 in Fort 
Myers as a team playing its best 
baseball of the season. Florida has won eight of its last 10 games and completed a 4-0 week with 
a 14-5 offensive outburst to com-
plete a sweep of then-No. 11 South Carolina. 
  The Gators faced an early 
season gauntlet of experienced 
teams. The Eagles were one of 
them, coming to Gainesville for the second series of 2013. Flori-da Gulf Coast outscored Florida 23-9. Junior right-hander Ricky 
Knapp threw a complete-game 
shutout in the series opener. The Florida bullpen surrendered 18 earned runs in 15 innings.
  “We played a really dif-
ﬁ  cult schedule,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “We’ve been through some tough times early in the year, and I think we are 
starting to grow up a little bit.”
  It’s been a gradual climb for 
Florida, who opened the year 
ranked 17th by Baseball Ameri-
ca.
The Gators ﬁ  nd themselves at 
No. 19 this week in the Collegiate 
Baseball rankings while garner-ing votes from Perfect Game af-
ter being unranked in each poll 
since Feb. 26. 
  “We’re getting good pitches. 
We’re getting aggressive,” Justin Shafer said.
“Experience helps as well. As 
you see these pitchers more of-ten, you get used to it.”
  Despite a Ratings Percent-
age Index of 18 and the tough-
est strength of schedule, a 
sixth-straight NCAA Regional appearance looked bleak for Florida before its recent surge. 
The Gators last failed to reach

 Coach Amanda Butler had 
a message for her team dur-
ing its ﬁ  rst offseason meeting 
last week: The best fruit rip-
ens slowly. 
  In a season marred by in-
jury and inexperience, the 
Gators took a step backward 
in 2012-13. After earning a trip to the NCAA Tourna-ment a year prior, Florida ﬁ  nished 22-15 and tied for 
eighth in the Southeastern 
Conference. 
  Despite the subpar sea-
son, Butler is conﬁ  dent in the 
shape of the program. 
  “That’s what we want from 
this group is the best fruit,” 
Butler said. “There’s a lot of excitement, a lot of things we 
have to look forward to.”
  The difference between 
the offseason that awaits this 
team and the one it experi-
enced prior to the season is 
staggering. 
  Florida was tasked with 
replacing six seniors from the 2011-12 squad that battled 
top-seeded Baylor in the sec-
ond round of the Big Dance. Only 35.1 percent of the of-fense returned from that 
group.
  But the Gators will return 
four of their ﬁ  ve regular start-
ers next season, as well as 85.3 percent of their scoring.

  Harrison Bader stood before reporters 
following Florida’s 4-1 loss to Florida State on March 12.
  Bader scored the Gators’ only run and re-
corded two of their ﬁ  ve hits against the Semi-noles in the defeat, which dropped UF’s record to 8-10.
  Alligator staff writer Adam Pincus asked 
Bader: “Can you describe this season so far for the team?”
  Bader took a deep breath and let out his in-
ner Tim Tebow.
  “It’s been tough. We’re doing everything we 
can to go game by game, pitch by pitch,” Bader said. “Obviously the result and the outcome isn’t what we want by any means, but we’re ﬁ  ghting out there. We’re never going to quit. That’s the most important thing.”
  Pincus followed up 
with Bader, saying: 
“You guys are putting 
in the work in day in and day out and the results aren’t showing 
on the ﬁ  eld. That’s got 
to become frustrating for you guys.”
  Bader continued to let his inner Tebow 
speak.
  “We’re never going to quit. It’s not going 
to happen,” Bader said. “As long as I’m on the 
ﬁ  eld, as long as anyone’s on the ﬁ  eld, we’re go-ing to put everything into it.”
  Obviously, this doesn’t quite compare to 
“The Promise.” Bader didn’t even include the “God bless,” kicker.
Even if the Gators defy logic and win the na-
tional championship in June, I doubt the folks 
at the UAA are going to commemorate Bader’s 
heartfelt words on a plaque at McKethan Sta-dium.
  Sorry, Harrison, but you just don’t have what 
it takes to be a Skip Bayless heart throb.
  But since Bader promised to keep giving the 
game his all following the loss to FSU, UF is 11-8. Bader is 22 for 75 with ﬁ  ve walks during the 19-game stretch, raising his batting average 10 
points and his slugging percentage 35 points.
  More recently, Florida has caught ﬁ  re, win-
ning ﬁ  ve straight games and eight of its last 10.  Freshman key to UF baseball's turnaround

Freshman outfielder Harrison Bader slides into home during Florida's 14-5 win against South Carolina on Saturday. 
Bader was named Southeastern Conference Freshman of the Week on Monday.Bader has served as the spark to the Gators’ latest tear.
He was named Southeastern Conference Freshman of 
the Week for the first time this season after hitting .462 with 
four RBI, two stolen bases and five runs scored in a 4-0 week 
against Top-11 opponents Florida State and South Carolina.
In a 4-3 win against the Seminoles on April 9, Bader scored 
three runs, including the game-winner in the top of the ninth. 
In Friday’s 4-3 victory against the Gamecocks, Bader hit a two-
run single in the bottom of the eighth, securing the tying and winning runs.
Despite his youth, Bader has been a steady contributor for 
a Gators team suffering growing pains in 2013. He has started 
35 of Florida’s 37 games this season, playing both left and cen-
ter field. He ranks third among Gators with a .285 average, third with 24 runs scored and first with eight stolen bases.
Most importantly, he has served as a key catalyst in Flori-
da’s midseason turnaround.
After a horrendous start to the 2013 campaign, the Gators 
have somehow climbed back into the winning ranks, improv-ing to 19-18 following Saturday’s 14-5 dismantling of the Gamecocks.
A movie fanatic like me enjoys pinpointing signature mo-
ments where the hero rallies the troops, defeats the villain and gets the girl. Bader’s postgame comments on March 12 seem-ingly fit the bill as the Gators' Hollywood moment, but reduc-
ing their turnaround to a singular event does a disservice to 
the freshman outfielder and his team.
Bader isn’t a folk hero or a legend. He’s just a guy who gets 
the job done. Day by day, pitch by pitch.

Guard Carlie Needles shoots during Florida's 69-58 
loss to Arkansas on Feb. 28 in the O'Connell Center.
JOE , from page 14
player the Gators will lose. 
“There’s a lot of teams in the SEC that are losing veteran 
players,” redshirt freshman Carlie Needles said. “We have 
to take everything that we had last year and build on that 
because we are going to be really dangerous this next year and the years to come.” 
Florida has not been ranked since the final poll was re-
leased in 2008-09. But the Gators have the pieces in place to snap that skid next season. 
“There’s already a good energy around this team that is 
really fueled by our high expectations,” Butler said. “They know they have a lot to build on.”
Williams confident: Ronni Williams, the first Gator signee 
to be selected to the McDonald’s All-American High School Game, finished with one point, three rebounds, a block and two steals during the contest, which was held in the United Center in Chicago on April 3. 
Butler said she texted Williams on Monday morning 
to encourage her to begin preparing for the daily grind that she will face at UF. Williams’ response was brief: ‘I’m ready.’ 
“She’s got the mentality of a champion and someone that 
wants to make history,” Butler said, “and that’s why it’s a special match with us because that’s what we’re pursuing: being better than we’ve ever been.”
Butler doubtful about Griner in the NBA: Dallas Maver-
icks owner Mark Cuban raised eyebrows earlier this month by saying he would consider drafting Baylor center Britt-ney Griner in the second round of the NBA draft. 
The comment has since drawn criticism from multiple 
outlets, including Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma. But-ler was equally against Griner entertaining the idea of play-ing in the NBA. 
“I think it’s silly,” Butler said. “That’s no slap against 
Brittney. She’s a great player, and she certainly has brought a level of attention to our game that we needed. We need players like that.”
Griner faced the Gators once during her career, scoring 
25 points — including one dunk — while collecting nine rebounds and six blocks in Baylor’s 76-57 victory in the sec-ond round of the 2012 NCAA Tournament.

Sacred Heart and Creighton were the only two 
teams to make a regional last season with a sub-.500 record. Six other teams made regionals with five or fewer more wins than losses.
Each of the eight teams won its conference 
tournament. 
As the season winds down, hitting and pitch-
ing have hit its stride. Starting pitchers have com-bined for a 2.74 ERA during the last 10 games.
In addition to their 10-run inning against 
South Carolina on Saturday, UF plated eight in the fifth inning of an 8-3 win against Mississippi State on April 7.
On Sunday, the Gators dugout and McKethan 
Stadium came alive during the sixth. Josh Tobias 
described it as “good energy,” providing a stark 
contrast from the doom and gloom that seemed to follow Florida everywhere for the first half of the season.
“It was disappointing. That happens, but we 
kept battling and grinding through it, because we know it is going to turn over eventually,” Tobias said. “As you see now, it finally has.”

WOMEN’s GOLF

While all eyes were on Florida 
senior T.J. Vogel at The Masters 
this weekend, another Gators golfer was making headlines on the professional circuit. 
Sophomore Camilla Hedberg 
participated in the LPGA’s Kraft Nabsico Championship in Ran-cho Mirage, Calif., and played well enough on Thursday to take an early lead in the first round. 
“I don’t think I have any 
words to describe how big (play-ing in the LPGA) was,” Hedberg said. “It was very cool and a great experience. I played really well Thursday and Friday. It was a great experience, and I got to play with some great players.” 
Hedberg, who finished in 
72nd place, was joined by senior Isabelle Lendl as two of the ama-teurs playing in the tournament.
Lendl did not make the cut af-
ter finishing 29 over par after the first two rounds. 
Both used the tournament as a 
final tune-up before Florida opens the Southeastern Championship 
on Friday, seeking to improve on 
last year’s fourth-place finish.   
“We have high expectations,” coach Emily Bastel said. “Our conference in women’s golf is deep. We’ve gone back-and-forth with a lot of the top SEC schools this year.” 
The Gators seem to be hit-
ting their peak at the right time as almost every golfer has seen improved play in the past few weeks.  
Most notable is freshman Ursa 
Orehek. Orehek showed poten-tial after tying for 17th — her best finish this season — at the Bryan National Collegiate on March 29-
31.

at Mark Bostick Golf Course. Hedberg finished the tournament in a ninth-place tie.
SOFTBALL
After taking two of three from No. 18 Kentucky, No. 3 Florida (41-5, 14-4 SEC) will travel to 
Tallahassee to play Florida State. The Gators will look for their pitching to improve against the 
Seminoles. Against UK, UF pitchers surrendered 11 runs on 25 hits. Hannah Rogers pitched 10 innings against the Wildcats. She picked up a complete-game victory in Game 1, but only 
pitched three innings in Sunday’s rubber game.
GYMNASTICS
Top-seeded Florida (15-2, 6-1 SEC) looks to become the fifth team in NCAA history to capture 
a championship. It would be the Gators’ first title. Florida was the runner-up in 2012 with a 
score of 197.775, losing to SEC rival Alabama in the NCAA Super Six. UF begins competition on Friday at 3 p.m. The Gators have met six of the teams that have qualified for the  2013 
NCAA Championships.
WOMEN’S TENNIS
No. 2 Florida (19-2, 12-1 SEC) tied No. 3 Texas A&M and No. 4 Georgia at 12-1 on Sunday to 
earn their fourth consecutive SEC regular-season title. The Gators are seeded third in the SEC 
Tournament, which begins Wednesday. As a top-four seed, Florida receives a bye in the first two rounds of play. UF plays its first match on Friday against the winner of Thursday’s match 
against one of the following teams: No. 6 seed Vanderbilt, No. 11 seed Kentucky or No. 14 
seed LSU.
MEN’S TENNIS
After defeating Vanderbilt 4-1 on Sunday, No.17 Florida enters the SEC Tournament after a 
rocky conference schedule. UF is 7-5 in SEC play, falling to South Carolina, Georgia, Auburn, LSU and Mississippi State during the regular season. The Gators share third place in the SEC with the Rebels, the Gamecocks and the Aggies but earned the No. 3 seed in a tiebreaker. Florida plays its first SEC tournament match on Friday.
TRACK AND FIELD
After competing in the Texas Relays and Florida Relays, the Gators were off last weekend. At 
the Florida Relays, the women’s 4x400m relay squad broke a longstanding school record. The Gators’ last home meet of the season is the Tom Jones Memorial Classic on Saturday at Percy Beard Track.
LACROSSE
Florida has gotten back on track since losing to Penn State two weeks ago. The Gators have 
scored 40 goals in their last two American Lacrosse Conference games, defeating Johns 
Hopkins 19-9 and Vanderbilt 21-10. No. 4 Florida (15-1, 3-1) takes on No. 2 Northwestern 
(13-1, 4-0) on Saturday at noon at Dizney Stadium.SWAMP SNIPPETS
