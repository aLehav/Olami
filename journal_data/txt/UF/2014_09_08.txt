RICHARD JOHNSON
Alligator Staff Writer @RagjUF
For 49 years, the University of 
Florida has been quenching your 
thirst with the signature sports drink 
of athletes everywhere — Gatorade. 
But still, its fanbase exists as a 
shriveled shell of what it used to be, 
deprived of what it feels it needs to 
survive.
It walked through the desert of 
woe that was seven straight losses 
and yearned for any kind of oasis through the long offseason it spent 
hearing and reading about 4-8. 
Even with more water than it 
knew what to do with last weekend, 
still it thirsted — and in a ﬁ  tting co-
incidence, Gatorade’s logo is a light-
ning bolt.
But Saturday, its thirst was 
quenched if only for an evening. 
Sixty-ﬁ  ve points the Gators 
scored, drawing up material for sus-tenance from the well of offense that has run dry for years.
For the ﬁ  rst time in 336 days, 
Florida won a football game, and it did so looking more like the 1994 iteration of itself than the 2013 one, 
beating Eastern Michigan 65-0. In that season opener in 1994, a 
game played almost 20 years to the 
day of this one, the Gators scored 70 points en route to a 49-point beat down of New Mexico State.
After waiting a week to kick 
things off, the Gators (1-0) wasted little time getting on the board after a 33-yard Frankie Velez ﬁ  eld goal capped off a 16-play drive that last-
ed six minutes and 31 seconds. 
It seemed like the ﬁ  rst half of 
Florida’s ﬁ  rst game was in some 
way making up for its offensive in-
eptitude that has existed for much 
of the post-Tebow era, and most prominently the debacle that existed on that side of the ball in 2013.
When the teams went in the lock-
er room, the Gators had 30 points on the board from seven drives — six of which produced points. Their 308 yards of total offense in the ﬁ  rst 
half were more than they had in ﬁ  ve 
full games during 2013, including the embarrassing loss to Georgia Southern toward the end of the sea-son. Florida has attempted 30 passes 
only ﬁ  ve times in the Muschamp era 
including twice last season. 
Quarterback Jeff Driskel had 33 attempts in the ﬁ  rst half alone, matching his career high.
Intoxicated by the points that 
ﬁ  lled the Swamp in overﬂ  owing quantities, Florida fans ended the game chanting, “we want 70.” 
A thirst that started for offensive 
production in general devolved into a thirst for Eastern Michigan (1-1) blood as Gator fans implored its team to score more, because it

A woman was grabbed from behind 
while walking through UF’s campus 
Monday night, launching a response from both UF Police and Gainesville Po-lice ofﬁ  cers. 
At about 8:42 p.m., the woman — a 
UF student — was walking near a vend-ing area between McCarty Hall build-ings B and C when a man grabbed her. UPD spokesman Brad Barber said the woman then kicked the man. He then ﬂ  ed on foot toward the Reitz Union.She was not injured.Despite arriving at the scene within 
three minutes and setting up a security 
perimeter that surrounded campus, Bar-
ber said the man who grabbed the wom-an was not located.
The man was white and wearing an 
orange shirt, black gym shorts and a black baseball cap. His description was similar to that of a man who attacked three different women both on and near campus in the last two weeks, UF 
spokeswoman Janine Sikes said.GPD, UPD respond to

More than 30 people were ejected, and 
one person was arrested during the Florida 
Gators football game against Eastern Mich-
igan University on Saturday.
Of the 32 people who were ejected, 25 
were UF students. The single arrest was 
also a UF student.
Eight of the 32 ejections on gameday 
were for possession of alcohol. Another nine ejections involved patrons who stood on their bleacher seats, according to UF Po-
lice.One person was ejected for disorderly 
conduct, two for ticket switching, two for smoking, one for sitting in the wrong seat, 
one for trespassing after warning, one for intoxication, one for throwing objects, two for sitting in the wrong section and four for not having a ticket.
The one arrest someone underage in 
possession of alcohol.
Although there were more ejections, 
there were fewer arrests than there were at 
the UF vs. University of Idaho game that 
was terminated on Aug. 30. 
At the UF vs. UI game, there were a total 
of three arrests. None of the arrests made that day involved UF students. The arrests 
at the ﬁ  rst game were also more violent, as 
two were for battery.32 people ejected on gameday

Donovan Bailey looked relieved as he was 
told to walk down onto The Swamp. 
Standing behind the yellow rope, Bailey 
pulled out his phone, braced himself to take 
a video of the sea of orange and blue jerseys that would soon run a mere few feet away from him. 
Bailey, a 25-year-old UF landscape archi-
tecture junior, was one of the 50 UF students randomly chosen to participate in the UAA’s first student tunnel. 
“It’s super special,” he said. “I didn’t know 
it was a thing.”
The randomly selected students and their 
chosen guest were invited by email to create a tunnel the Gator team would run through at the start of the game.
This is the first time the UAA selected stu-
dents to partake in a student tunnel on the field, said Alicia Longworth, assistant athletics director.
“Nothing is more exciting than the team 
running out onto the field,” Longworth said. “We wanted students to feel that moment and 
have that memory.”
The tunnel was originally set for the first 
gameday against the University of Idaho on 
Aug. 30, but it was canceled due to unsafe weather conditions.
“I saw it coming,” Bailey said. “But there’s 
still the same energy.” 
After getting rained out at the Idaho game, the same group of students came back together Saturday to stand on the field against Eastern Michigan University. 
But some students weren’t able to attend 
the Saturday game.
Chemical engineering junior Brendan Du-
fresne, 20, grew up watching the Gators play with his parents, who are alumni. Dufresne only heard about the tunnel hours before the 
Idaho game.
Because he had to work Saturday, he gave 
his spot to his 18-year-old brother Nick, a UF 
music and computer science freshman. 
Annaleigh Bonds, a 20-year-old UF public 
relations junior, said she has been going to Gator games since she was 3 years old. She and her sorority sister Haley Ponnock came to Gate 16 smiling just as wide as they were the week before. 
“It’s really cool that of all the people here, I 
was selected because I’m a big Gator fan,” she said. “It’s a dream come true.”
Bonds didn’t question the validity of her 
email and contacted Ponnock, a 21-year-old UF public relations senior, right away. 
After the Gators entered the field and stu-
dents were shuffled off, Bailey and Warnet took a moment to collect themselves as fans cheered wildly around them. 
Longworth said she hopes to have a stu-
dent tunnel at one game each season. 
“We want all students to feel more connect-
ed and have that special moment,” she said. “We appreciate the fans.” Saturday’s game held first UAA student tunnel entrance
UPD reminds students to stay vigilant 
“Certainly we would like to have some answers,” 
Sikes said. “It’s concerning.”
The previous suspect was described as a white male 
either in his late 20s or early 30s. He is between 6’4” and 6’5” inches and around 250 to 260 pounds. 
Rain spilled into storm drains as dozens of soaked of-
ficers at security checkpoints stopped cars from leaving campus, attempting to locate the man. 
“We absolutely take it personal,” UPD Chief of Po-
lice Linda Stump said. “We’re running out every lead we get.”
She identified the last four incidents as “predatory 
behavior.”
“We are concerned it may or will escalate,” Stump 
said.
As of Monday night, five GPD officers were patrol-
ling campus along with UPD, Stump said. Security per-sonnel were also set up around Library West to protect students and remind them not to walk alone. 
To help students travel safely across campus, Sikes 
said two vans were added to the Student Nighttime 
Auxiliary Patrol on Friday. She said UF is currently 
seeking to expand GOTCHA and Later Gator services as well.
Stump said if SNAP gets backed up or other transpor-
tation methods are not available, students can call UPD for an officer escort. Officers will give students rides and walk with students across campus if needed.In the back halls of UPD, boots clopped and doors 
slammed as officers traded information and helped set up the Emergency Operations Center, which answered dozens of parent and student phone calls, controlled ru-mors and collected suspect information. 
The center combined efforts with UPD, the Dean of 
Students Office, Student Affairs, Greek life and other campus organizations to monitor phone lines.
This was the first time, to Stump’s knowledge, that 
the center had been put in place to thwart violent inci-dents and locate a suspect.
“You know, I’ve been here 11 years, and we’ve never 
set it up for anything other than hurricanes,” she said.
The four victims involved in the series of incidents 
are cooperating with police, Sikes said.
“These women have been incredibly strong in that 
they have done everything right,” Sikes said. “They have screamed and fought, and that’s what we have asked our students to do if faced with a similar situation. All of us have got to double down in taking care of each other and making good choices moving forward.”
Anyone with information regarding the incidents 
should contact UPD or GPD. Officers strongly encour-age individuals to remain aware of their surroundings and to call 911 immediately to report any suspicious ac-tivity or individuals.
“We need help out there from the public,” Stump 
said. “We’ve got more eyes and ears out there than (UPD) will ever have, and we need those kind of phone calls from our campus.”ASSA ult , from page 1� THEY ANNOUNCED 
AFTER THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES RETREAT.

Eight applicants for the new 
UF president were announced 
Friday on the presidential search website.
The search committee re-
vealed the names after meet-ing at the UF Board of Trustees retreat. 
The committee discussed 
key traits and objectives the next president should possess 
when UF President Bernie Ma-
chen retires in December. 
Some of the first applicants 
for the position include UF Provost Joseph Glover; Abra-ham Joseph Layon, Geisinger Health System director of critical care; Ronald Nykiel, Special Advisor to the CEO of 
the Pantheon Chemical Corp.; 
and Kamal Dean Parhizgar, professor of management and business ethics at Texas A&M International University. 
The committee reviewed a 
term sheet outlining the em-ployment contract and can be negotiated later, said Raymond 
Cotton, an outside consultant 
who joined the meeting on a conference call. 
He read through the term 
sheet’s 26 items, which in-cluded serving a five-year term, benefits and compensa-tion. The list also incorporated short- and long-term goals for 
UF, such as adopting strategic 
plans for preeminence.
Jan Greenwood, owner of 
the search firm Greenwood/Asher & Associates Inc., updat-ed the committee on marketing efforts. She said the number of applicants will be small, but there has been a positive re-sponse about the preeminence goals. 
“We’re serious about get-
ting the best president to achieve top 10 status,” Green-wood said. 
Outreach themes like pre-
eminence hiring, Land-Grant Mission contributions and furthering  UF’s commitment to the arts were identified through responses to the two search criteria questions sent to the greater UF community in an email at the end of August. 
More than 100 people sent 
feedback, which showed focus and interest, said Jodi Gentry, assistant vice president of Hu-man Resource Services. 
Gentry opened a brain-
storming session to pin the important qualities of a presi-dent, which would be turned into questions for future candi-
dates. Strategic, open minded 
and synergetic were among the mentions. The president should also focus on the student experience and on maintaining UF’s status in the Association of American Universities.
“There’s really no limit to 
where we can go,” said Va-
sudha Narayanan, committee 
member and UF Department of Religion professor. “It’s a moving horizon. We can get there, and we will get there. ”
Presidential Search Com-
mittee Chairman Steven Scott said the whole university must get involved to prove they are 
ready for this change.  
“We’ve been challenged to 
move into the top 10,” Scott 
said. “We’re in a comfortable spot now. But all those below us want our spot. If we don’t do anything, we’re going down.”Eight applicants

Six state parks in Alachua County are offering free admis-
sion today in honor of International Literacy Day.
Park admission fees will be waived for guests who bring 
a library book or valid library card or donate a new or used 
family-friendly book today, according to a Florida Park Service 
press release.  
The only park not participating is Skyway Fishing Pier State 
Park.
Alachua County is home to the six participating state parks: 
Paynes Prairie, Devil’s Millhopper Geological State Park, Dud-
ley Farm, Gainesville-Hawthorne State Trail, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings Historic State Park and San Felasco Hammock Pre-serve State Park.
“International Literacy Day was established by UNESCO 
(the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Or-ganization) back in 1965,” said Erin Phemester, youth services manager at the Alachua County Library District.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Or-
ganization established International Literacy Day 49 years ago, Phemester said.
The Florida Park Service will also host about 15 outdoor ac-
tivities throughout the state spotlighting this year’s theme, Lit-eracy and Sustainable Development.
About 11 percent of Alachua County adults lack basic lit-
eracy skills, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Though literacy rates are rising globally, the United Nations estimates about one-fifth of the world’s adult popula-tion cannot read or write. 
JoAnna Platzer, a 21-year-old UF zoology and classics se-
nior, said the incentive is not only to go to state parks but also to promote literacy as “beneficial to our state.”
“Florida has such a great variety of quality state parks. Flo-
ridians can really benefit from spending more time discovering the wonders of books,” Platzer said.MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Students interested in running as 
a candidate for the UF Student Sen-
ate can qualify and choose to run with five registered political parties, but only one major party will be on 
the ballot  — a first in recent years.
UF Student Government began the interview process for students 
looking to qualify for the Fall 2014 elections on Sunday.
Five parties registered by Fri-
day’s deadline, but only the Swamp Party, the majority party founded in 
2012, chose to campaign, said Hans 
Rojas, SG supervisor of elections.
Fall elections seek to fill 50 senate seats based on students’ residential 
locations. 
Eleven students qualified on the 
first day, Rojas said. Sunday saw a 
record low turnout following Spring 2014’s nearly 60 students and Fall 2013’s 42 students on the first day of qualifying and slating, according to 
Alligator archives.
All 11 students who qualified 
chose to slate with Swamp Party.
“Although it is a bit different, it 
really shouldn’t change the way we run our campaign,” said Swamp 
Party spokeswoman Katie Back-strand about running unopposed.
Michael Christ, a former Stu-
dents Party candidate, said running the opposing party takes a lot of ef-
fort for marginal gains.
“Students should have a choice 
between multiple parties when they 
vote,” said Christ, a 21-year-old UF political science senior.
The Swamp Party will announce 
its candidate roster on Wednesday.Alex Nunner, an 18-year-old ac-
counting freshman, interviewed to represent the Lakeside area.
“I just think I could help, and 
I think it would be a great way to learn what’s going on on campus,” 
he said.
Qualifying and slating will con-
tinue today from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. and 
Tuesday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom.

� HE TORE UP HIS VISA.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
SEOUL, South Korea — Detained 
American Matthew Miller will be 
tried next Sunday, North Korean state media said, less than a week after the detainee made a rare foreign media 
appearance to plead for help.
Pyongyang’s official Korean Cen-tral News Agency said in a brief dis-
patch Sunday that the Supreme Court decided to “judge” Miller on Sept. 14. It did not elaborate on specific charg-es against him, although past reports 
have accused him of hostile acts.
Miller, 24, was detained after en-
tering the country April 10, when he 
tore up his tourist visa at the airport and shouted that he wanted to seek asylum, KCNA has reported.
In a brief interview with The As-sociated Press last week, Miller and two other Americans held by North Korea, Jeffrey Fowle and Kenneth Bae, called for a direct appeal by a U.S. official for their freedom.
Bae, a Korean-American mission-
ary, is accused of plotting to over-throw Pyongyang regime. Fowle is suspected of leaving a Bible in a nightclub in the northern port city of Chongjin, where Christian evange-lism is considered a crime.Trial set for US detainee in N. KoreaRecord low turnout of 11Reader response

to protect yourself from a sexual assault? Today’s question: Do you support medical marijuana 
legalization in Florida?Senator’s push for 
ﬁ  lm screening is 
indoctrination
There’s a common trope in the conservative movement that 
liberals control American schools and use them to brain-wash and indoctrinate impressionable American youth.
Conservative publications like RedState and the Internation-
al Business Times have published articles about how the public 
school system is turning American children into tree-hugging, 
Obamacare-loving liberals.
If there was actual indoctrination occurring in American pub-
lic schools, what might that look like? Perhaps a bill introduced in the Florida Legislature that would require classes in all 1,700 Florida middle schools and high schools to watch a ﬁ  lm that clearly and unabashedly promotes a speciﬁ  c political ideology.
In fact, just such a bill was recently introduced in the Florida 
House of Representatives. So, which power-hungry Democrat, 
eager to brainwash our children with his liberal lies, introduced 
this dangerous piece of legislation? As you may have guessed by now, it wasn’t a Democrat who introduced this bill, but a Re-publican. Sen. Alan Hays introduced a bill that would require Florida students to watch Dinesh D’Souza’s “America: Imagine a World Without Her” unless their parents speciﬁ  cally object.
D’Souza’s ﬁ  lm is nothing more than an elaborate piece of 
conservative propaganda. It relies less on historic facts than it does on assumption that everything America has ever done was 
absolutely right and good, no questions asked. But what about 
slavery? The Vietnam War? The century of oppression between the end of the Civil War and the civil rights movement?
There’s nothing wrong with celebrating all the positive things 
about America, and students should certainly be encouraged to demonstrate civic pride and patriotism.
However, part of being a responsible and empowered citizen 
is being fully informed, and that means understanding Ameri-can history as a complex and nuanced topic. Rather than simply 
viewing the U.S. as a perfect, divinely ordained “City on a Hill,” 
students should be taught about the problems America faces so they can start to think about how to ﬁ  x them.
Even if one were to argue that “America” merely presents a 
valid alternate take on American history, D’Souza’s ideological bias is well known. His previous foray into ﬁ  lmmaking was titled “2016: Obama’s America,” which intended to damage President Barack Obama’s re-election prospects before the 2012 election. But it was riddled with inaccuracies and conspiracy theories.
D’Souza also recently pled guilty to violating New York 
campaign ﬁ  nance law. D’Souza persuaded two individuals to donate $10,000 each to his friend Wendy Long’s 2012 Senate campaign and then reimbursed them.
Between his penchant for creating propaganda and his legal 
troubles, D’Souza does not seem likely to contribute much sub-stance to the American education system.
Our goal as Americans and Floridians should be to build 
and maintain a public school system that encourages students 
to think for themselves. Mandating screenings of propaganda in 
Florida’s public schools seems likely to do the opposite.Stop blaming women for sexual assault
The recent notiﬁ  cations from University Police have 
the UF campus on high alert. The terrifying news of four attempted sexual assaults in the nighttime 
hours have left UF students afraid of walking home alone. But these attacks are isolating one group of people in par-ticular: women.
It is all too easy to chalk up these recent incidents to 
natural occurrence. Some argue that women are supposed to know better than to walk alone at night because they are sexual targets. However, these individuals miss the 
central point of this issue.
The conversation we need to be having is about why 
women are seen as sexual targets and sometimes unable to 
associate freely in public simply because of their gender.
In a recent email sent out over the UF listserv, UPD 
Chief Linda Stump wrote that her message served “to re-mind you of the importance of looking out for your own safety and that of others.” Because the recent attacks have speciﬁ  cally targeted women, it gives the impression that 
her message is telling female students to take better care 
of themselves when they are out.
Society too often blames the victims in cases of rape 
and sexual assault. We may ask: What were you doing walking home without a chaperone?
In modern America, there is seemingly an entire rule-
book of precautions that women must follow before they leave their homes.
Don’t go out at night. If you have to go out at night, 
take a friend. Don’t wear clothes that might provoke a man. Pay extra attention to your surroundings — whether that means staying sober or not talking on the phone while walking down the street for fear of being attacked.
 Yes, there are precautions women can and should take 
to better ensure their safety. However, none of these pre-cautions confront the real issue at hand here, which is men attacking women.
When are we going to start trying to prevent this preda-
tory action in men so that women may exist freely without constantly being put at risk?
The issue of sexual assault on 
college campuses garnered atten-
tion last year after tales of several 
sexual assault cases that were poorly handled by university of-ﬁ  cials made national headlines. 
Earlier this year, President Ba-
rack Obama established a special task force to protect students af-
ter a study determined that 1 in 5 female college students is sexually assaulted at school. 
These new developments on the issue of sexual assault 
come after UF experienced an alarming trend itself, ac-
cording to crime statistics from UPD — one forcible sex 
offense in 2008, ﬁ  ve in 2009 and 11 in 2010. Not all offens-es are reported, so there could have very well been more rapes and sexual assaults in those years. Although UPD has not released statistics for the past three years, UF has 
seen more reported sexual assaults in this past week than 
in 2008 alone.
There is no simple solution to ending acts of sexual vio-
lence against women, but simply telling women to be more careful and take extra precautions is not nearly enough.
As a start, more exposure and education on the issue 
of sexual violence could make a signiﬁ  cant positive dif-ference. Every Fall, freshman students have to complete a short module on alcohol safety. An accompanying mod-
ule on appropriate sexual behavior, including information 
about consent and sexual assault, would go a long way toward combatting these important issues.
Ending violence against women at UF and in America 
is not the responsibility of women alone. We should all 
work toward a future where young women are sent off to 
school with shower shoes and printer ink as going-away gifts and not pink, pocket-sized bottles of pepper spray.

Swamp Party invites students to join 
party and Student Senate 
Dear UF students,
My name is Katie Backstrand, and I cur-
rently serve as the spokeswoman for the 
Swamp Party. I am pleased to announce that the first day of slating has been extremely successful. 
We have heard many excellent ideas from 
students who have participated in the slating process.  The Swamp Party is confident that there will be a qualified, competitive pool of candidates to select from to serve the UF 
Student Body in Student Senate this year.
We thank all of the students who came 
to slate with us and highly encourage any 
student interested in serving as a senator to consider slating with the Swamp Party.  Slat-
ing for Student Senate is a great way to get 
involved on campus, share your ideas and 
help give back to UF.
In addition, the Swamp Party has a his-
tory of accomplishing the goals established 
in its platform. We are eager to continue serving to ensure the greatest possible col-lege experience for UF students. 
The entire Swamp Party executive board 
looks forward to the remaining two days of 
slating in order to select the most power-ful, experienced and determined leaders to 
represent the students. Student Government 
plays a vital role in the advancement of stu-
dent life. By slating with the Swamp Party, 
students can serve in this role, too.

UF Student Body Presidents reminds students of safety tips
Fellow Students,Sexual assault is a serious problem on 
college campuses nationwide. UF Student Government is also concerned about this important issue of campus safety.
There have been (four) sexual assaults re-
ported on or near campus in the past week. In addition, in a 2013 survey, 4 percent of UF students surveyed reported they had ex-perienced non-consensual sexual touching within the last 12 months.
Over the summer, SG recognized the 
need for greater awareness about sexual assault on campus. Taking a proactive ap-proach, we have planned the first Sexual As-sault Awareness Week, which begins today.
Our goal is to raise awareness about sex-
ual assault on campus, promote the variety of resources available to students should a sexual assault occur and encourage students to sign up for risk reduction/prevention training offered at UF.
In addition to encouraging all Gators to 
stop by our table at Turlington this week to learn more about the issue of sexual assault, I also strongly want to remind UF students of some important safety tips from UF Po-lice:
Report suspicious activities or individu-
als immediately by calling 911. 
If someone bothers you, don’t be embar-
rassed to attract attention to yourself. Yell! 
Stay in well-lit areas away from alleys, bushes and entryways. 
Avoid walking alone. Visit the App Store on your smartphone, 
and download the following mobile applica-tions:
Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol app: 
SNAP is an on-campus service that gets you home safely. Download the SNAP app in your App Store to request a ride. 
TapShield: TapShield is a mobile app that 
can be used to contact police with the tap of a button and sends UPD your GPS location.
In addition, always know that you can 
contact U Matter, We Care at umatter@ufl.edu, UPD Victim Advocates at 352-392-5648 and the Counseling & Wellness Center (352-392-1575).
Ensuring student safety is our No. 1 prior-
ity. I hope that you take some time this week to learn more about the issue and make our campus a safer place.

Letters to the Editor
With the rise of the Islamic 
State group in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a Sunni jiha-
dist group in the Middle East that is labeled as a foreign terrorist or-
ganization by the U.S. and many other nations, 
the entire world is on high alert, waiting for whatever barbaric action the group has planned next.
Amid all the chaos, the world is looking to 
President Barack Obama for leadership on this important issue. Unfortunately, the president’s position continues to be that ISIS is a “manage-able problem.”
ISIS has engaged in a number of horrific and 
brutal acts in recent weeks, including the be-heading of two American journalists in less than one month. An eyewitness report from massa-cre survivor Ali Hussein Kadhim indicated that ISIS killed approximately 1,700 Shiite soldiers in one day. 
ISIS has shown it is an enormous threat to 
American national security. What we need 
right now is a dialogue on how America is go-
ing to respond to these atrocious acts, but still we continue to hear a lackluster approach from Obama.  
Immediately after ISIS released the video 
showing the beheading of American photojour-nalist James Foley, British prime minister David Cameron cut his vacation short to address Fo-ley’s horrendous death and the potential threat 
toward the UK. 
Philip Hammond, Britain’s foreign secretary, 
stated that “if ISIS becomes established in Iraq 
and Syria it will undoubtedly use it as a base for launching attacks on the West.”
And what did our president do? He paused 
his golf game to give an insincere speech about the death of James Foley. Within minutes of his speech’s conclusion, he was back out on the golf 
course for another round.
Giving the impression that you care more 
about your handicap than the murder of an 
American citizen at the hands of foreign terror-ists is not acceptable. We need to hold Obama accountable and demand that he do something about what is happening.
Although the Obama administration has 
moved outrageously slow toward formulating 
a plan to combat ISIS, there have been some mi-
nor accomplishments. Obama stated in a speech Wednesday in Estonia that it’s important that “we know that this is a mission that’s going to work” and that “we have allies behind us.”
It seems logical that we not 
overreact to the beheading videos 
from ISIS, as its purpose is to make us respond without thinking rationally.
The last time we went into the Middle East 
without a definite plan, or even a goal, it took a decade for us to even begin discussing the with-drawal of troops. I agree with Obama about the importance of forming coalitions with interested allies.
With strong multilateral support, the U.S. 
can be confident that we aren’t the only ones with skin in the game if sending in troops does become a possibility.
Although it is important to act cautiously 
and rationally, we cannot wait much longer. If no one is willing to back up the U.S., we must face ISIS before attacks begin on our own soil. As of Aug. 19, the Islamic State has an army of more than 50,000 fighters, and that number is 
unquestionably growing every day.
A good piece of legislation that could help 
slow ISIS’s progress will be introduced this 
week by Sen. Bill Nelson. The bill would grant the president clear authority to engage in air-strikes in Syria, where ISIS’s base of operations is believed to be located. 
The airstrikes that have been happening in 
Iraq for the past month have definitely slowed 
the growth of ISIS, but they are not enough to 
completely eliminate the group.
It’s time for Obama to step up to the plate 
and address the ongoing crisis as the command-er in chief. Bob Baer, a former CIA operative, sent a warning last week that “ISIS is here (in America),” and it is “capable of striking” with sleeper cells that are already established in the homeland.
What Obama deems a “manageable prob-
lem” is actually far worse. ISIS is more than just a group of “JV” terrorists, as the president called them. ISIS represents a clear and present risk to America, and it must be dealt with before any more innocent Americans die.
The only way to eliminate ISIS is to obliterate 
its military and monetary resources and kill its members. Until that happens, ISIS will continue 
to present a significant threat to the U.S.

According to statistics 
from the College Board, the average 
(inflation-adjusted) cost of tuition and fees at private, 
nonprofit, four-year colleges has essen-
tially tripled over the last four decades. This trend is replicated in the cost of tuition and fees at public four-year col-leges. Increase in average cost of tuition far outpaces inflation trends reflected by the change in the consumer price in-dex for all urban consumers.
The result? College is becoming 
prohibitively expensive. This fact isn’t news, but it deserves investigation. Instead of being discussed in terms of the artificially manipulated supply and demand economics of the student loan game, perhaps it should be viewed as a symptom of American elitism.
It’s no secret that post-secondary 
education is a universal barrier to en-
try for Americans looking for employ-
ment. What is a mystery is the lack of connection between the ever-lowering cost of exchanging information and the ever-increasing cost of higher educa-tion. If post-secondary education truly espoused its ideals of knowledge being the most important exchanged com-modity and learning engendering more 
learning, it would be more concerned 
with quickly and cheaply getting stu-dents to the point of what is considered basic market competency.
It’s worth noting that actually going 
to college provides a student with much more than most online courses can, but it should be acknowledged that this is then the actual service being provided 
and paid for. Should students really be 
put into financial bondage to “make friends” and “network?” Is the cost of administering testing for personal ac-creditation really worth the financial freedom of an entire generation?
Of course it isn’t. Earlier this year, 
Princeton and Northwestern Univer-sity released a study which determined 
that the U.S. is an oligarchy, based on 
research which indicated that policies are influenced more by special interest groups, noting that “economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial in-dependent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citi-zens and mass-based inter-est groups have little or no independent influence.”
Elitist culture is en-
trenched in all levels of society, espe-cially in private and public education circles. Higher education should be considered as perpetuating this cul-ture of elitism, since more and more it only allows the children of the already wealthy to succeed within the system.
Nonprivileged students play the 
loan game hoping to come out on top. 
They know they are probably capable 
of performing at the level of CEOs.
Unfortunately, the truth about their 
actual chances of success is often de-emphasized by the existing power structure to keep them playing a game that will ultimately benefit the economic gatekeeping business of post-secondary education. In a world where basic edu-
cation should and can be a universally 
accessible commodity, general personal accreditation has no place being abused as a tool of class warfare.
Participants in higher education have 
a moral obligation to fight for more af-fordable education. Students should be realistic in their financial planning and not gamble against their likely wage-
earning ability in the future. University 
administrators should stop abusing the availability of student loan money in the name of expansionist, brand-mar-keting university policies, fight against the value-sapping “good ol’ boys” club of regional accreditors and encourage forgiving transfer-of-credit policies.
Families should educate their chil-
dren with free resources and look to en-roll their students in primarily compe-tency-based personal accreditation, and in doing so, look to devalue entrenched name brands.
Policymakers and voters should 
consider how to quickly fix a broken student loans system and save a gen-eration from unnecessary debt. Overall, 
Americans should recognize that high-
er education is unnecessarily becoming less about educating and more about protecting elitist ideas of success.

Chiquita Johnson was 
booked at the Alachua Coun-
ty Jail Saturday around 12:50 a.m. after hitting someone’s car with a board with several 
nails protruding out of it.
Gainesville Police spokes-
man Officer Ben Tobias said 
Johnson, 26, was angry be-cause she did not receive her disability check. Her check had been delayed due to La-bor Day.
The person whose car she 
hit was unrelated to the check, according to her arrest report. The vehicle was parked at 3826 SW 30th Terrace.
Johnson smashed the 
windshield, all four doors, the headlights, the taillights and the rear window. She caused an estimated $1,000 worth 
of damage, according to the 
jail’s inmate booking log.
Johnson was charged with 
felony criminal mischief. Her bail was set at $3,000.

A UF poll has found that the ma-
jority of Floridians are in favor of 
an amendment that would legalize medical marijuana. 
A poll by the Bob Graham Center 
for Public Service, alongside the UF Bureau of Economic and Business Research, the Tampa Bay Times and Bay News 9, revealed that 57 per-cent of Floridians were in favor of the Florida Right to Medical Mari-juana Initiative, while 23 percent op-posed it. 
Organizations such as Drug Free 
Florida are concerned with the reg-istration and regulation of treatment centers, patients and caregivers — a task reserved for the Florida Depart-ment of Health.While some are wary of the 
amendment, others are preparing to take it head on. The Cannabis Career Institute will visit Gainesville on Oct. 25 to educate clients about fu-ture opportunities in the marijuana 
business.
“The general public has no idea 
about the practical applications of marijuana,” said Robert Calkin, 
president of the institute. “The prob-lem is getting them to listen.” 
At least 60 percent of Florida vot-
ers would need to vote in favor of the amendment to legalize medical marijuana.
Kristen Burns, a member of UF’s 
National Organization for the Re-form of Marijuana Laws, said past ideas of the drug hinder progress.
“I think that among the older 
generation, there is still a mindset of reefer madness,” said the 20-year-old psychology junior. “I think it should be your right to choose what substances you put in your body.”
Gainesville resident Rolena 
Howle said she thinks people will abuse the system if it is legalized.
“I agree there are people who 
have medical issues that probably could be helped with the use of it, and my heart goes out to them,” she said. “But still, the risk is greater for the rest of the public than it is for that individual.”

The Florida Department of Envi-
ronmental Protection raised about 
$15.6 million for conservation after selling a nearly 80-acre nonconser-vation state-owned property.
The land will be used to build a 
new sports complex, but the money raised from the sale will fund future conservation initiatives, according to a DEP press release.
The DEP closed the sale with 
Southeast Legacy Investments LLC last Tuesday. 
 “The department accepted bids 
for the property until Jan. 29, 2014 at 10:30 a.m.,” Mara Burger, DEP spokeswoman, said in an email.
The department’s Division of 
State Lands, which buys and sells nonconservation lands for Florida, received and opened the bids. The minimum offer was $9 million and a deposit of $200,000. 
Southeast Legacy Investments 
LLC was the highest bidder. Gov. Rick Scott and the board of trustees approved the sale March 6.
“We have a lot of many beautiful 
things in Florida, and the fact we can conserve many of these places with a 
sale like this is something positive,” 
said McKinley Lewis, Department of Health spokesman.The land is about 280 miles from 
Gainesville, but future sales could be closer. Multiple state-owned lands will be sold over the next couple of months, Burger said. The DEP hopes to raise about $40 million for future purchases of conservation lands.
Mark Hostetler, UF wildlife ecol-
ogy and conservation professor, said the combined efforts of state and county is important to consider concerning conservation.
“The state can only raise so 
much,” Hostetler said. “Every level can do its own part in conserving the environment.”

Mallory Vila, 18, types her in-class notes on her laptop while 
Gaby Placido, 21, takes handwritten notes in class.
“I kind of decide to write down things that the teacher says 
that aren’t in the book or on the slides, like added content to 
what’s already provided,” said Placido, a UF wildlife ecology 
and conservation junior.
According to a study,  “The Pen is Mightier Than the Key-
board,” published in April by Psychological Science, students 
like Gaby Placido, who take handwritten notes in class, are more likely to score higher on tests.
The study, which resurfaced at the start of the Fall semester, revealed that students who take handwritten notes can retain and process information better.  
Writing down added content and main ideas is key, said 
Robert Bailey, UF’s supplemental instructions coordinator. 
“As the person’s talking, you’re just typing everything 
they’re saying,” he said, “as opposed to listening actively and 
saying, ‘OK, that’s important,’ and writing it down.”
Vila, a UF chemistry freshman, said her laptop shortens her 
note-taking time, but sometimes it hinders her processing abili-
ties. 
“It doesn’t give me a chance to actually develop what they’re 
saying and interpret it,” she said.
Bailey stressed the importance of students writing down the 
main ideas of the lectures and then going back into their notes, organizing them and adding information from PowerPoints and textbooks. 
The Teaching Center, located at Broward Housing, offers 
workshops and online videos on note-taking, as well as a link to the Cornell Note-taking System, which Bailey said he recom-mends for students.Study: handwritten notes better for understanding than typed

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
SAN FRANCISCO — Three judges on 
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals are set 
to hear arguments Monday on gay marriage bans in Idaho, Nevada and Hawaii.
The hearings come as gay marriage sup-
porters have piled up legal victories in federal courts across the country this year, nullifying bans in more than a dozen states.
On Thursday, the federal appeals court in 
Chicago rejected bans in Wisconsin and Indi-ana. Same-sex marriage opponents, however, scored a legal victory last week when a federal judge in Louisiana upheld that state’s ban.“Until all 50 states get on board, it’s a legal 
battle from state to state,” said Tara Newberry, one of the plaintiffs in the Nevada case, who 
wants to marry her long-
time partner. “The map is 
changing. But until the Su-preme Court of the United States makes the determina-tion, it’s state-by-state.”
The same day as the Chi-
cago court ruled, 15 states 
that allow gay marriage and 17 that don’t asked the 
U.S. Supreme Court to settle the issue once and for all.The Mormon church and four religious or-
ganizations also asked the Supreme Court to intervene. 
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints, in a statement Friday, said it joined a friend-of-the-court brief asking the high court to hear Utah’s marriage case. 
It was joined by The United States Confer-
ence of Catholic Bishops, the National Asso-ciation of Evangelicals, the Ethics & Religious Commission of the Southern Baptist Conven-tion and the Lutheran Church-Missouri Syn-od. Each teaches that marriage is between a 
man and a woman.
The pro-gay marriage rulings have used the rationale the nation’s high court used in 
June 2013 when it invalidated the core of the Defense of Marriage Act that defined mar-riage as only between a man and a woman for 
determining federal benefits.
That ruling didn’t directly address whether 
states can impose bans and led to an explosion 
of litigation. 
But an increasing number of federal and 
state judges are adopting the court’s reasoning in the 2013 case to invalidate bans, ratcheting up pressure on the Supreme Court to address the issue directly, legal analysts say.
The 9th Circuit panel is under no deadline 
to rule.

Jake McGee will miss the entire 2014 season with a broken 
tibia and fibula after playing less than one full game for the 
Gators.
The transfer tight end from Virginia was carted off the field 
during the second quarter of Florida’s 65-0 victory against 
Eastern Michigan. McGee’s left leg was rolled on awkwardly, 
causing trainers to immediately run out and immobilize his leg with an inflatable cast.
“I’m so disappointed for him,” Muschamp said. “It’s very 
difficult to come into a situation for one year, and he has done it as well as you could possibly imagine.”
McGee failed to record a single re-
ception during Saturday’s contest and was only targeted once by quarterback 
Jeff Driskel.
The redshirt senior would be eligible for a sixth year at the 
collegiate level because of the injury. However, McGee could 
also enter the NFL Draft in May.
“Losing Jake was obviously a bad deal,” Driskel said. “He’s 
a great guy and I wouldn’t wish that upon anybody. But losing him, I think, is going to be big for our team. I feel for him and his family right now. Knowing him, I know he’ll respond and make the most out of it.”
Left tackle D.J. Humphries also left the game in the first half 
with a lower-leg injury, but his diagnosis was much less severe than that of McGee’s.
The junior was taken to the locker room during the first 
quarter after chipping a bone in his ankle. Humphries will miss the next two weeks.
“It’s not anything serious,” Muschamp said. “There’s no 
surgical issues there. There’s going to be some swelling, it’s go-
ing to be sore but no surgery is needed.”
Replacements impress: Clay Burton took the majority of 
the game’s reps at tight end after McGee’s injury, and the se-
nior impressed the coaching staff.
Burton led all receivers with seven catches after recording 
just three catches in his previous three years at UF.
“We’ve got all the confidence in the world (in Burton),” 
Muschamp said. “That’s why he’s a starter and he’s a guy that has continued to make plays for him. He’s a very valu-able member of our organization. He really understands of-fensively what we’re trying to do and the things we try to do with him.”
On two different occasions, Driskel completed two straight 
passes to Burton. Although his longest reception on the day was just 9 yards, Burton proved to be a reliable short-yardage target in Kurt Roper’s spread system.
At quarterback, Treon Harris relieved Driskel at the start of 
the fourth quarter. And although the true freshman had just two pass attempts, he made each count.
Harris completed a 70-yard touchdown pass to Demarcus 
Robinson in his first collegiate pass attempt. On his second, he connected with Mark Herndon for a 78-yard score, which put Florida up by the eventual final score of 65-0.
“We felt like we had some deep-ball opportunities in the 
game and I told Kurt (Roper), ‘The guy needs to play,’” Mus-champ said. “He needs more and more of those reps, and more and more of those opportunities to go in and play.”
First-touch success: Running back Brandon Powell and 
safety Duke Dawson each scored a touchdown on their first touches in their first collegiate game.
Powell’s first rushing attempt ended in a 12-yard dash to the 
end zone. Dawson returned a 36-yard interception for a touch-down, which marked the first time in UF history that a true freshman recorded a pick-six in his first collegiate contest.
Defensive tackle Caleb Brantley did not score Saturday, but 
the redshirt freshman did recover and force a fumble in his first game for Florida.

Carli Snyder is a freshman, but she 
doesn’t play like one. 
And she certainly doesn’t talk like one.
Snyder refused to give in to No. 3 Texas 
on Saturday night, even after losing to No. 
8 Florida State just 48 hours earlier, and even after being thrust into the starting 
lineup for the first time in her career.
“Give us more,” Snyder said. “Give us 
more top-10 teams. I would have this any 
day, we would have this any day over roll-ing over someone.”No. 11 Florida (3-2) fell 3-1 to Texas 
(4-1) Saturday night, but the final score 
hardly mattered to coach Mary Wise and 
the Gators.
This is what Florida wants — to play 
the best there is, and to provide an atmo-sphere to develop its five freshmen.
“It’s what we scheduled, and we are 
a better team from this,” Wise said. “But you got to be careful what you wish for. … There’s going to be a learning curve, and 
right now we’re growing.”
Texas ran out to an early 20-12 lead in 
the first set, largely due to its blocking 
ability. The Longhorns have nine players listed 
at or taller than 6-foot-2, compared to just three for Florida.
“(Texas’) height definitely had an effect 
on how we played because you have to play so much higher above the net,” Sny-
der said. “They’re big girls.”
Florida dropped the first set 25-16 but 
bounced back in the second largely due to 
the play of Snyder. The freshman set a career-high with 18 
kills and led UF to a 28-26 second set vic-tory.
“Early on in the first set, (Snyder) was 
struggling. She hasn’t seen the size of those blockers very often,” Wise said. “But 
(she) made an adjustment and she made 
the changes she needed to. Her ability to swing to get kills in different spots, to hit high balls against one of the best blocking 
teams in the country, it was pretty impres-
sive.”
The match was tied at one, but it was 
the last time the Gators would score. 
Texas captured the third set 25-17, fol-
lowed by a 25-16 victory in the fourth to seal the win.Gators volleyball falls to second straight top-10 opponentNotebook: McGee out for season, young players impress

Santos-Lamb, Snyder 
have career nights against the Longhorns
The battle at the blocker po-
sition was the deciding factor. 
Texas’ Sara Hattis, listed at 
6-foot-4, and Haley Eckerman, 
6-foot-3, rendered UF’s mid-dle blocker Rhamat Alhassan ineffective for a majority of 
the match. Alhassan ﬁ  nished 
the night with seven kills and three blocks.
Instead, redshirt junior 
Noami Santos-Lamb made a 
large impact, ﬁ  nishing with a 
career-high 14 kills.
“It’s really good to play 
teams with that physical type 
of blocking early in the season 
to see what you need to work on,” Santos-Lamb said. “It’s awesome to have Khat Bell up there and Sara Hattis up there to really see how much I need 
to work on.”
Florida will continue play 
against its slate of top-20 op-
ponents when it faces No. 15 
San Diego and No. 6 USC next 
week.
“It’s tough but its exciting. 
I mean, we don’t get this until 
the tournament. And this is the 
best preparation we can get,” Snyder said. “This is what we want — tough competition.”VOLLEY , from page 13

UF junior outside hitter� THE LINEBACKER HAD TWO SACKS 
IN THE FIRST HALF.

UF defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin 
said Wednesday that he wants to use Nei-
ron Ball more in pass-rushing situations 
this year.
Heading into Saturday’s season opener 
against Eastern Michigan, the redshirt se-
nior linebacker had just one sack and three 
tackles behind the line of scrimmage.
But in the first half of the Gators’ 65-0 
rout of the Eagles, Ball made his presence 
known in the backfield — recording two sacks for a loss of 13 yards, a forced fum-
ble and a quarterback hurry.
Ball finished the game with a team-
high-tying six total tackles.
“Neiron’s a very good football player,” 
coach Will Muschamp said. “He’s a guy 
that can really play well in space as far as a linebacker’s concerned. He’s got good off-the-ball instincts. … If we can get him into some matchup situations — people 
are probably going to slide over to Dante 
(Fowler) — and create some one-on-ones with Neiron.”Ball was just one of several standouts 
from a Gators defense that limited the 
Eagles to 125 total yards of offense and 
forced five turnovers.“We needed this game, especially not 
being able to play last weekend” said 
Fowler, who logged three tackles. “Just 
having all that rage, that fire, built up and you finally just let it out on Eastern Michi-gan. It felt good.”
The Gators’ defense was stout through-
out the first half, forcing seven three-and-outs and not allowing the Eagles to earn a first down until the second quarter.
Florida rotated 10 players along the 
defensive line, allowing the linemen to re-main fresh during their reps on the field, which has been a goal Muschamp and Durkin set for the season.
That depth resulted in the Gators re-
cording nine tackles behind the line of scrimmage for a loss of 30 yards.
“There wasn’t one time that I went on 
the field that I was tired,” Fowler said. 
“So being able to have 10 guys rotate in … 
that’s always a plus.”
But despite Florida’s success on de-
fense — limiting Eastern Michigan to just 
2.3 yards per play and only allowing the 
Eagles to reach the Gators’ side of the field once — Muschamp knows improvements need to be made.
“Defensively, I thought we did OK. I 
think there were some things they missed, a couple things in the secondary espe-cially,” Muschamp said. “We’ve got to get that cleaned up.”MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Neiron Ball (11) sacks Eastern Michigan quarterback Reginald Bell and forces a 
fumble during Florida’s 65-0 win on Saturday at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
Ball highlights dynamic Florida defense in season-opening win
Driskel threw for 248 yards, Harris threw two touchdown passes
wasn’t enough. 
“I had a headset on and I was 
looking around and that’s just great 
that the fans — the students in gen-
eral stayed that long,” Driskel said. “I feel a new energy from our fans. That’s great, we really do appreciate 
that.”
When it was over, Driskel was 31 
for 45 in total, and the achievement 
marks only the second time a UF quarterback has had more than 40 
attempts since 2005. 
Driskel threw for 248 yards and 
one touchdown, but in only two 
passes, his understudy arguably overshadowed Driskel’s efficient performance with two splash plays that immediately endeared him to 
fans. 
True freshman Treon Harris took 
over the game with 35 seconds left 
in the third quarter and although he 
threw only two passes, both of them 
were touchdowns of more than 70 yards.
“(The passes) were great, com-
ing in as the first two passes of your 
career, two touchdowns, that’s awe-
some,” Driskel said. “That’s just a testament to coach Roper getting us all prepared and Treon really pick-
ing it up quickly.”
Florida’s 65 points were the most 
for a UF team in the Will Muschamp era, and the most a UF team has 
scored since scoring 70 against The Citadel in 2008. 
The 65-point scoring margin was 
the most lopsided since the Gators pounded Kentucky by the same score in 1996. 
The Gators’ 655 yards of total of-
fense were the ninth most in school history, and Driskel said he had nev-er been apart of anything like it, and neither had center Max Garcia.
“Never. Not even at high school, 
not at Maryland, not here,” Garcia said. “I feel like that’s just what we can do this year. That was the first 
game, we’re getting the kinks out 
and everything but we went out there and we just played with a lot of excitement. I feel like a lot of guys were just enjoying themselves on the field today and I was just really 
happy myself.”
Gatorade’s tagline for years, “Is it 
in you?” could be easily applied to 
the Florida football program since 
No. 15 hung up his pads in 2009. 
The offense has never had the 
same potency, or anywhere near it 
for most of the games played since, leaving people to wonder if such 
margins of victory were even pos-
sible in Gainesville.
It’s not a win over a vaunted 
powerhouse, but the victory over 
Eastern Michigan proved that it is, 
that the Gators’ offense has a fourth gear — or even a fifth and a sixth for that matter.
Florida brought the nourishment 
Saturday its fanbase has so eagerly 
craved, but it won’t satisfy for long 
with 10 more games to play. 
That’s how football and life 
work. 
You drink to get hydrated, and 
then you must do it again. Florida fans certainly hope the Gators can get a few more bucket of nourish-ment from the well during the rest 
of the season.
“I’ll say I’m satisfied,” Garcia 
said with air quotes around the last 
two words. 
It was good enough for this week, 
now the Gators move on to the next one.
