Broward Hall turned 59 this year, and 
like seniors tend to do, it’s getting a face-
lift.
The residence hall is getting new bath-
rooms, lounges, windows, electrical sys-tems, ﬁ  re alarms and sprinkler systems. Interior walls are being repainted, doors replaced and new locks installed.
The upgrades come as part of a roughly 
four-year renovation program at UF, Sha-ron Blansett, assistant to the associate vice president for student affairs, wrote in an email. 
$10.3 million has been spend on the ren-ovations so far, she said.
Estimated costs for next summer’s im-
provements total $5.3 million. Summer 2015’s projects will cost the same. Final window replacements in 2016 will cost $680,000.
The renovation funding comes from 
students’ rent only — no state tax monies, Blansett said.
This is the second year of the Depart-
ment of Housing and Residence Educa-tion master plan’s four-year renovations project, which includes plans to make over campus facilities.

Alachua County has a new CEO.
At least that’s how Betty Baker, the in-
coming county manager, views her new set of responsibilities.
She was selected Tuesday by the Alachua 
County Commission to ﬁ  ll a vacancy after a fruitless out-of-county search. Her primary responsibilities will include carrying out policies set forth by county administration and managing day-to-day operations.  
Baker has worked for Alachua County 
for 11 years and most recently served as the deputy county manager. Before that, she worked in Ohio, where part of her job was conducting a government-produced talk show to connect with resi-dents.
Baker said the new 
position may give her a platform to handle issues students care about, such 
as improving transporta-tion. She hopes to revisit a county internship pro-
gram that’s currently placed on hold due to budget constraints.
County Communications Coordinator 
Mark Sexton said Baker will bring many strengths to the position.
“She has the reputation of being fair,” he 
said. “Somebody who encourages innova-tion.”
Baker will serve until her retirement next 
year, while the county keeps searching for a more permanent county manager.
But for now, she said she’s happy to be at 
the center of Gainesville.
“I actually fell in love with the people 
in Alachua County,” she said. “Three years turned into 10 and also two promotions. It was meant to be, as they say.”

� HE BALANCED A 
MOLOTOV COCKTAIL ON A 
BALLOON ON THE SHOW.

Alligator Contributing Writer
When UF student David Fer-
man revealed his stunt, Heidi 
Klum hid behind a table. How-ard Stern clasped his hands in a prayer-like gesture. Nick Cannon cringed in fear.
But Ferman stayed cool, bal-
ancing a bottle of gasoline and a lit wick on a balloon and catching it on a stick — in his mouth — once he popped it.
The performance earned the 
19-year-old UF marketing soph-omore a ticket to Las Vegas to compete in the next round of this season’s “America’s Got Talent.”
“No one has 
ever gone out there and actu-ally balanced a ﬁ  rebomb,” Ferman said. 
“No one has ever done a juggling stunt 
with an actual bomb that could blow up on stage.”
The conﬁ  dence to do so has 
been 11 years in the making.
When Ferman was 8, he was 
called on stage to participate in a show on a cruise. The perform-ers joked with him, saying they’d take him on the road someday if he learned how to juggle.
So he did.After one year he could per-
fectly juggle three balls, but it was not until his father surprised him with a visit to a juggling conven-tion that Ferman realized it was what he wanted to do for the rest of his life.
Ferman came to “America’s 
Got Talent” holding the world record for juggling the most balls — 10 — with 26 catches. On the show, he faces acrobats, musi-cians, dancers and more for $1 million.

Gainesville Police arrested 
a Miami man Tuesday after 
police said he stomped on pre-scription pills that fell from his pant legs. 
According to the arrest re-
port, Officer Bryan Jones pulled up behind a black Chevy car parked on Interstate 75 with its hazard lights blinking.
While shining floodlights 
into the car, Jones saw the driv-er crawl into the back seat and the rest of the passengers shuf-fling around, according to the report.David Hicks, 40, climbed 
out of the car through the pas-senger side and walked to the patrol car, according to the re-port.
While Jones spoke to Hicks, 
Jones noticed large amounts of prescription pills falling from the bottom of Hicks’ pant legs. Hicks then stepped on the pills and smashed them into the con-crete, according to the report.
After Jones physically re-
strained him, the remaining pills were identified as Oxy-codone, Hydromorphone and Xanax.
Hicks was arrested at about 
5 p.m. and booked into the Ala-chua County Jail on charges of tampering with evidence, drug trafficking and possession. He remained there as of press time with bond set at $120,000.Stopped in traffic, man

In the battle between Cookie 
Monster and Captain Vegetable, 
Uncle Sam wants the fresh and green.
The government is banning junk 
food in public schools nationwide starting in the 2014-2015 school year, according to a U.S. Depart-ment of Agriculture press release.
The “Smart Snacks in School” 
nutrition standards will affect vending machine items and snacks that are not a part of the regular school lunch. Maria Eunice, direc-tor of Alachua County School Board Food and Nutrition Services, said she thinks Alachua County schools are a step ahead of other counties.
In 2006, the government re-
quired schools to develop and ap-ply wellness policies that address nutrition and physical activity.
“We put a pretty strict wellness 
policy into place,” Eunice said.
Alachua County started making 
adjustments in 2006 to meet the nu-trition requirements. For instance, the school system went from offer-ing whole milk to 2 percent milk, to now offering only 1 percent and fat-free milk, Eunice said. The schools will also offer only whole-grain products. 
“What has been very beneficial 
for our county is how we’ve done it over time,” Eunice said. “It helps students to present it [healthy op-tions] to them slowly.”
She said some counties did not 
make many adjustments in 2006, so the “Smart Snacks in School” standards will cause them to make drastic changes.
For example, the calorie limit for 
snack foods — those not included in the meal itself — in the Alach-ua County wellness policy is 250, and the limit by “Smart Snacks in School” standards is 200, she said.“In our county, students 
shouldn’t worry,” she said.
While the price of healthy food 
has been a challenge for Alachua County schools, losing retail pizza has been a challenge for students, Eunice said. Alachua County got rid of retail pizza last year.
Rachael Marsh, a 16-year-old F. 
W. Buchholz High School junior, does not agree with the govern-ment’s new standards.
“I believe that people should 
have a choice,” Marsh said. “If people want to eat junk food, they should be able to eat junk food.”
She said the only change she has 
noticed is the switch from Godfa-ther’s Pizza to a healthier version.
Making changes to school food 
is a good place to start, she said, but she pointed out that students only eat one or two meals at school a day.
“What are their families supply-
ing them?” she asked. “What are their habits when they get home? I think we have to do a better job as a community educating families.”
Govt. to schools: no junk food next year

In between practicing his stunts, 
Ferman juggles classes, spending 
time with his family in Jacksonville and hanging out with his brothers at UF’s Alpha Epsilon Pi house. The fraternity hosted a viewing party for the airing of Ferman’s Chicago audition.
“My first time performing the 
bottle trick was at my fraternity’s chapter,” he said.
Ferman’s brothers, friends and 
family are looking forward to the Las Vegas episodes that will air 9 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday.
“We are very proud of him, and 
we are excited that he’s doing so well,” said his mom, Heather Fer-man. “We would like to see him excel in what he does best.”
He said his next performance 
will be shocking.
“If you just come at it thinking that you are going to make these elaborate, huge tricks that are out of this world, like a magician does with these big illusions,” David Ferman said, “then you are taking the art form to a whole new level.”
said he’s glad Broward is getting 
a “much-needed” makeover. Jackson said he used to visit friends who lived in a triple at Broward, and it wasn’t always pleasant.
“The bathrooms were pretty 
gross, and the paint was peeling in some spots,” he said. “It felt pretty beat-up.”
Jackson said the campuswide 
renovations show him students’ money is going to good use.
“I can’t wait to see what all 
these old buildings will look like once they’re renovated,” he said.
Blansett said all current 
projects, including Broward’s upgrades, must be finished by early August to accommodate incoming students. 
Broward’s renovations have 
been ongoing since 2006, but this summer marked its turn for a major upgrade.
Broward is being renovated 
in parts, Blansett said. 
This summer is focused on 
the east and central sections. The southwest and central sections are scheduled for upgrades dur-ing Summer 2014, and in 2015, the northwest section will be worked on. Windows are being replaced throughout.
Blansett said the contrac-
tors for the projects are chosen through a competitive bid pro-cess, and the current contrac-tors, BBI Construction Inc., has worked with UF’s housing de-partment on previous projects.
Former Broward resident Josh 
Loftin said living there freshman year was a great experience.
But the 20-year-old said the 
bathroom was often “wrecked,” and his air conditioning unit would routinely break down.
Loftin said he’s happy the 
housing department decided to renovate the building.
“The people and the commu-
nity of the place was amazing — you couldn’t ask for more,” he said. “The building itself, though, not so much.”

When the Alachua County 
Department of Motor Vehicles 
closed its doors and merged with the Alachua County Tax Collec-tor’s office in March, the effects of the change were uncertain.
Months later, the transition 
seems to have proven success-ful.
The wait time at the North-
west 34th Boulevard — formerly 34th Street — office is typically about 26 minutes, followed by 12 minutes at the downtown of-fice at 12 SE First St. and 10 min-utes at the Butler Plaza office, 3207 SW 35th Boulevard, said John Power, chief deputy at the Alachua County Tax Collector’s office.
Though wait times have been 
cut significantly, Mondays and Fridays remain the two busiest days.
“We don’t have specific data, 
but we had heard that some-times people had waited two or three hours in the past,” he said. “Prior to the merge, there was one location. It’s simple math: There was one office with about 10 employees serving the whole county. Now we have three of-fices and over 30 employees in that customer service position.”  
Power said the tax collector’s 
office takes care of about 5,000 li-censes a month, or 1,200 licenses weekly.
He said customers should try 
to utilize the Archer and down-town offices because the most traffic is going toward the 34th Boulevard location.
“That location of our office is getting about 50 percent of all the transactions,” he said. “The Archer Road location in Butler Plaza is doing about 30 percent of transactions, and downtown is about 20 percent.”
The merging of the offices 
has left the DMV building unoc-cupied, but the Northwest 34th Boulevard office still uses the building’s driving course for tests.
Donna Johnson, executive 
director of public service for the tax collector’s office’s Northwest Gainesville branch, said the change has pleased customers.
“They are elated that the wait 
time has gone down,” she said. “We do feel like it has been suc-cessful.”
Rita Hart, division coordina-
tor for the Northwest Gainesville branch, who has worked at the tax collector’s office for almost two years, said the change has been efficient despite the pos-sibility that it could have been a rough transformation.
“I think it’s great when you 
consider what a big transition it was,” she said. “Adding all the new technology, the scan-ners and printers and cameras — all that stuff could go wrong. All in all, I think it’s been really good.”DMV and tax office

Darts & Laurels
Inmates at Guantanamo have been on hunger strike for more 
than 150 days, with 45 of the inmates being force-fed to sustain their lives. Human rights and medical groups all over the globe have condemned the practice.
Recently, rapper Yasiin Bey, formerly known as Mos Def, 
subjected himself to the same force-feeding techniques that the Gitmo inmates are subject to. Bey was chained to a chair as doctors prepared to insert more than a meter of rubber tubing through the nose down to the stomach. It wasn’t long before Bey pled for the doctors to stop.
For shedding the light of humanity onto this cruel and un-
usual custom, we give Bey a LAUREL.
Texas teen Justin Carter was arrested in February for com-
ments he made on Facebook during an argument with some-one about online video game “League of Legends.” During the course of the conversation, he said, “Oh yeah, I’m real messed up in the head, I’m going to go shoot up a school full of kids and eat their still beating hearts,” followed by “lol” and “jk.”
The 19-year-old has since been jailed and charged with mak-
ing terrorist threats. He has also been placed on suicide watch. In his father’s own words “...he’s had concussions, black eyes, [and has been] moved four times from base for his own protection.” On his current condition, “He’s been put in solitary conﬁ  ne-ment, nude, for days on end because he’s depressed. All of this is extremely traumatic to this kid. This is a horrible experience.”
His bail is set at $500,000.We give the state of Texas a free-Justin DART, because 
that’s how you treat people when you actually want them to get “messed up in the head.”
Our last volley concerns international relations, and we’d 
better pay attention. When widespread surveillance of EU communications was discovered, it seemed that the world had united in its discontent against the National Security Agency’s widespread surveillance programs.
But then, the plane of President Evo Morales of Bolivia was 
forced to land in Austria after suspicion that he was harboring Edward Snowden, the notorious NSA leaker. This prompted the heads of state of South America to hold an emergency meeting of Union of South American Nations. The Cochabamba Declara-tion issued at the summit calls the forced halting of President Morales’ plane a “ﬂ  agrant violation of international treaties.” Unasur is now calling for the governments of France, Portugal, Italy and Spain to apologize.
So, why would other countries be so willing to aid the U.S. 
in capturing Snowden, even at the expense of international trea-ties? Snowden may know why. Der Spiegel magazine recently quoted Snowden as saying “They [the NSA] are in bed with the Germans, just like with most other Western states.”
So, what’s really going on, and who should we trust? It’s 
tough to say for now, but we’re sending wake-up FLARTS to 
the people. There’s a big debate being waged right now, and we all need to be conscious of it and participate in it. What will be the future of the surveillance state?
Unemployable? Consider working the pole
Chris Rock once said, “My only job in life is to keep my 
daughter off the pole.” If my parents have the same expectation for their son, this column will disappoint 
them.
I’m not going to use the cliche line, “I just need some ex-
tra money to put myself through school.” That’s not exactly true. I need the money for after graduation.
A tech company in Gainesville hired me as a program-
mer, and I felt ecstatic. I had triumphed over all the nasty statistics about 20-somethings being unemployed.
The tech industry can be unpredictable. Though my pro-
spective company was well-managed, it had to postpone its job offer because one of its clients had a change of plans. With this, I joined a horde of UF seniors scavenging for employ-ment.
Applying for jobs is an oxymoron contest: Be modest 
while touting your accomplishments. Be succinct while tell-ing them everything. Be casual while wearing a stuffy suit. I needed a break from interviewing and ﬁ  lling out applica-tions. Just for fun, I researched outlandish jobs.
Becoming a monk was one possibility. In The New York-
er last month, Larissa MacFarquhar wrote about how men apply to join a Zen monastery in Japan. Candidates climb a steep mountain, then knock on a wooden gateway.
By tradition, the head monk orders the candidate to leave 
and slams the door. The candidate must then grovel for em-ployment for two or three days as he sleeps outdoors. In oth-er words, becoming a monk is like graduating from a liberal arts college.
Next, I tried a Google search for “highest salaries,” which 
revealed that some hedge fund managers make $250,000 an-nually — not to mention bonuses. I could do that, I thought. It would be a small matter of gaining 50 IQ points and purg-ing myself of empathy.
Computer systems analyst sounded like another promis-
ing job. It was listed among 2013’s best careers, but most of the analyst jobs were related to the animal slaughtering and oil drilling industries. I imagined breaking the news to my liberal friends and family on Thanksgiving.“Cody, I heard you got a job 
working with computers. What do you do, exactly?”
“Let’s wait until you ﬁ  nish that 
turkey.”
That’s when I discovered the 
most intriguing position of all: full-time pole climber. A Colorado ﬁ  rm needed workers to scale the massive steel poles of cable towers 
in the Rocky Mountains.
Climbing is no joke. My dad had a job ascending towers 
in the Southwest when he was in his 20s, and the experience left him with chilling stories. He was once suspended 100 feet in the air, dangling from four wires, when three of the wires snapped.
I have a longstanding fear of heights, but as I applied to 
air-conditioned ofﬁ  ces, I began to daydream about the cow-boy-esque climbing gig. As an escape from writing real cover letters, I wrote a fake letter I thought might woo Denver’s cable company.
To Whom This May Concern:I’m conﬁ  dent that my varied climbing experience quali-
ﬁ  es me to scale your poles.
In elementary school I started climbing trees, mailboxes 
and other pole-like objects, and I haven’t missed a day. When my college commissioned a 20-foot-tall statue of a couple kissing, I shimmied to the top just to discourage them from public displays of affection.
I never allow common sense or so-called laws to interfere 
with my passion for climbing. When my boss ﬁ  red me for re-fusing to leave the equipment closet, I told him I was literally trying to climb the corporate ladder.
I look forward to joining your team regardless of what 
Chris Rock and my parents say. If all the good pole climbing jobs are taken, may I start as a programmer and work my way up?

One of the greatest and most useful 
sources of learning experiences in college cannot be found in any class-
room, textbook or library. Living with an-other person — or two or three other people — can at times be extremely frustrating, but it can also be a valuable learning experience.
As a freshman in the Fall of 2009, I moved 
into a dorm room at a small liberal arts col-lege in North Carolina. My roommate was a guy — I’ll call him Clark — whom I had never met prior to move-in day. Within just a few days of moving in, I became irritated with him.
Clark used Axe body spray every morn-
ing, and the potent aroma would force my ﬁ  rst few conscious breaths of each day to be laced with aerosol. His use of spray deodor-ant as a substitute for showering made our dorm smell like a junior high school locker room. He went to bed early and complained when I would wake him up coming home late. Clark watched weird TV shows and took up all the room in the mini fridge.
At the time, Clark was — as far as I was 
concerned — a terrible roommate.
But since my ﬁ  rst roommate experience in 
2009, I have shared dwellings with a number of people, learning quickly that Clark really was not too bad of a roommate at all. I say this not simply because I have had compara-tively worse roommates, but because I have gotten better with dealing with it all.
In the past four years, I have had room-
mates who were my friends upon moving in and enemies upon moving out. 
I have had a roommate who enjoyed mak-
ing three-course meals, but refused to do the dishes afterward. I’ve dwelled with a guy who peed on the toilet seat, never ﬂ  ushed and complained about the bathroom smelling of urine. I have had a room-mate who regu-
larly stayed up until nearly sunrise blaring rap music.
You will likely never entirely get along 
with every person you live with throughout your college career — that is just a fact. A simple Google search of “how to deal with annoying roommate” yields humorous re-sults. There are pages upon pages of people ranting about their roommates. The postings say things like, “My roommate is so annoy-ing, she never cleans up!” or, “My roommate is so annoying, she expects everything to be so clean!”
The easiest way to deal with what you 
consider to be an annoying roommate is re-alizing that your own habits and behavior could be seen as annoying as well.
Looking back at my time living with Clark, 
who annoyed me with his strange TV inter-ests and early bedtimes, makes me see that I was surely annoying to him, too. I would wake him up by coming home late, which surely was not fun for him. And his weird TV interests weren’t necessarily “strange” — they were simply not what I personally enjoyed.

While many people scurried to 
avoid the rain Friday, downtown 
Gainesville lit up its own Vegas-style block party — complete with casino games like blackjack and Russian Roulette, a psychic reader, a magician, local vendors and live music.
From 5-10 p.m., the Pledge 5 
Foundation hosted the First Friday Gainesville event themed “Viva Gainesvegas.”
Participants who purchased a 
ticket earned tokens and VIP wrist-bands that granted them access to specials at various local businesses in the downtown area. Attendees also participated in a block party.
“In spite of the weather, I like 
that everyone’s still getting their drinks and going out to eat,” Sabrina Viola, 20, said. “It’s nice to have the deals and have a reason to come out here on a Friday night.”
Kicking off the evening was the 
Charity Mingle at Maude’s Classic Cafe. People interested in commu-nity service were able to meet with Kathy Finelli, executive director of Gainesville Rabbit Rescue, to learn how they could get involved.
“There’s a tremendous need for 
rabbit rescue,” said Finelli, whose organization has been protecting rabbits and educating people about rabbit care since 1998. “Pledge 5 is a great organization trying to get volunteers for different charities.”
Despite the numerous activities 
available for participants, the event was tied to community service. Pledge 5 collected new and gently used board games to donate to the Boys and Girls Club. People could either bring the games to Honda Gainesville or to the Opera House, where they received a passport of sorts to downtown specials.
Those who brought board 
games earlier in the week won free VIP wristbands, while those who brought them in during the event received five dollars off.
“I think Pledge 5 is really com-
munity driven and we like to bring people together, and I feel we like to bring people to the local busi-nesses and bring traffic to them,” said Heather Lilholt, office manag-er at Pledge 5. “I just want people to understand Pledge 5’s vision for community and giving back.”
Topping off the evening was the 
silent auction and the Honda dice roll. Participants could win credit from playing casino games and us-ing the specials in their passports to bid on items in the silent auction.
Some of the items included vin-
tage-framed photos of Tim Tebow, Elvis and Muhammad Ali, a cruise for two to the Bahamas, a bag of goodies from Trader Joe’s and a gift certificate from Student Maid.
Courtesy of Honda Gainesville, 
attendees could roll dice for a chance to win a new Honda Ac-cord. People could either use their VIP wristband to roll the dice or stay consistent with the organiza-tion’s namesake and pledge to do five hours of community service.
Next month’s theme is “Dog 
Days of Summer.” According to Pledge 5 director Jason Bowman, it will appeal to many people in Gainesville — especially in light of the recent city commission ruling that allows dogs to be with their owners while they eat at local restaurants.“We’ll have all sorts of dog-re-
lated activities like doggy ice cream and a paw front mural,” Bowman said. “Most of these locations down here all have patios, which make them pet friendly.”For more information about

Shopping for the best prices around 
Gainesville can be made easier with a stop to 
Ward’s Supermarket or Trader Joe’s.
Both companies strive to deliver high-
quality products at an affordable price to customers but embody different shopping experiences. Trader Joe’s offers private label products directly from manufacturers, where-as Ward’s Supermarket buys straight from the fields, farms or any warehouse.
Alison Mochizuki, director of public rela-
tions for Trader Joe’s, said it’s truly a grocery store unlike any other. 
“Trader Joe’s is a store of stories — every 
item in the store has its own virtues, high-quality ingredients, great flavor or simply an extraordinary price,” Mochizuki said.
Mochizuki said Trader Joe’s carries an ex-
tensive array of domestic and imported foods and drinks that are purchased from manufacturers and not distributors.
“Trader Joe’s introduces 
approximately a dozen new items every week, heighten-
ing the store’s adventurous appeal,” she said.
Mindy Reinders, a 21-year-old UF public 
relations senior, said although Trader Joe’s of-fers an overall good shopping experience, it’s not somewhere she could get everything.
“Because they only sell their products, they 
don’t have much to choose from — so I still have to go to Publix,” Reinders said. “It needs to incorporate more products to become peo-ple’s first choice for a grocery store.”
Reinders said the difference between the 
two companies is the quality of the products.
“The produce section at Ward’s Supermar-
ket is really good whereas Trader Joe’s pro-duce is cheaper but not always good quality,” she said.
Danielle Ward-Williams, general manager 
for Ward’s Supermarket, said customers con-tinue to return to Ward’s because they know where the products are coming from, and they can see the quality.
“Our store is significantly different from 
other stores because we have buying power,” she said. “The prices at Ward’s Supermarket are cheaper and better because it can buy direct from any warehouse because it is not locked into contract with any specific ware-houses.”She said Ward’s Supermarket buys from  
more than 350 local vendors, which helps with the price of items because it comes directly from the fields and cuts out the middlemen. 
“I think we try to have as much variety as 
possible to be able to have a melting pot like we call our store,” she said.
Cori Wells, a 22-year-old UF public rela-
tions senior, said she continues to shop at Ward’s Supermarket because of its conve-nient location near her apartment and the lo-cally grown products.
“The concept of the store is geared toward 
customers who strive to live a healthier life-style and like to buy local products,” Wells said.
Wells said both Ward’s Supermarket and 
Trader Joe’s keep the prices low. 
“I don’t feel like I’m breaking the bank 
when I go to either of them, and it’s cheaper than eating out,” Wells said.

There are several reactions you 
can elicit from a person to indicate 
that you have asked him or her a stupid question. He might (1) chortle at you; (2) sneer at you and sneak a sideways glance at his near-est compatriot to make sure that he, too, is in on the inside joke that has just become yourself; or he might (3) simply unhinge his lower jaw so it hangs in the air like the mouth of a hooded pitcher plant. When I asked the front desk of the Florida Mu-seum of Natural History to see the “Botanical Chords: The Art and Sci-ence of Plants and Cells” exhibit, I was granted reaction number three. 
(A brief aside: I have written a 
number of articles for the Alligator in which I interact with people and ask them questions. Unfailingly, I am always greeted with befuddle-ment and incertitude. I can only as-sume that I either speak Korean to people unwittingly or I am a giant cat that has somehow learned how to talk.)
From experience, it is never 
a good sign when someone acts surprised after you request to see something that has been advertised. It means they are making assump-tions about you or the thing in ques-tion is terrible. I will not go as far as to say “Botanical Chords” is bad, by any means — but it is wholly under-whelming.
The exhibit itself is located in 
a hallway of the museum across from the insect display and is only a handful of images. To be honest, I walked back and forth thinking I was lost before I realized that what I thought was background art (think coffee shop paintings of sunflowers) turned out to be the exhibit itself.
“Botanical Chords” is a series 
of composite images of a flower, paired with a magnified image of the flower’s epidermis. What you see is the flower superimposed over an image of its flower guts — the combination is supposed to instill in us the notion that we should have an “appreciation of the beauty that lies just below the level of resolution of our own eyesight,” to quote the art-ist/botanist, Terry Ashley. Ashley is a retired research scientist from the Yale University School of Medicine who considers microscopy “an un-der-recognized art form,” according to the exhibit.Of Ashley’s work, two images 
that did catch my eye were compos-ites of the “Hooded Pitcher Plant (Sarracenia minor) with cellular border” and “Moss with cellular border.” The hooded pitcher plant is a carnivorous plant that has always generated an intense curiosity in me, and the moss, at first glance, looks like a photo of a moonrise, which calls attention to the hidden geogra-phy of microscopic images and the complexity that lies beneath the sur-face of things.
“Botanical Chords”’ biggest 
drawback is that after a number of images, you start to get the feeling you’re looking at bathroom art —  which might be due to the potpourri quality of the medium — and that the exhibit is directly across from displays of rare bugs, giant tarantu-las and cocoons hatching live butter-flies. This may actually explain the exhibit’s curious placement, because while I’m busy looking at the butter-flies, there’s something for the but-terflies to take in as well.

Dear Mediocre Advice,
Unfortunately, I am not gifted in the breast 
area, but I have a push-up bra that makes 
what little I have look great. The problem is I always feel like it’s false advertising since it’s mega padded, so I’ve only worn out once. Should I say “screw it” and wear it, or go with 
one that does the job —just not as well?
Dear Friend,
A lot of things women wear are illu -
sions: makeup, extensions, heels, etc. It is a fact that there is no way my butt and legs look as good as they do with -
out unreasonably high heels. Wearing a push-up bra is just another illusion. If you like the way it looks on you, wear the bra. Everyone has some kind of illusion. Just because some guys wear ridiculously tight shirts does not mean they have bigger muscles; it means they bought a child’s shirt. Whatever you’re wearing or putting on your face should mainly be for yourself and because you like the way it looks, not for impressing others.Dear Mediocre Advice,
I have no attraction of any kind to 
any of the girls in the country I’m liv -
ing in. There are a few other Western -
ers to bang, but that requires a bit of traveling. Should I just take one for the team, close my eyes and bang one of the locals? Or should I maintain my 
shallow standards?Dear Mediocre Advice,
My older sister frequently uses abusive and 
vulgar language. How do I change her ways?
Dear Friend,
Don’t bone someone you’re not attracted to. 
You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. Think about how hard it’s going to be to main -
tain a boner. Having standards is a good thing. Standards are the reason I’d rather stay home on a Saturday night instead of going to some medio -
cre bar and getting hit on by the embodiment of poor parenting. I’d rather masturbate in my show -
er and call it a night. Keep your standards. Get ad -
dicted to a show with a ton of seasons, like “Lost” or “Doctor Who,” and beat the meat until someone at least half-decent comes around.Dear Friend,
Unless she’s addicted to heroin, 
doesn’t support gay marriage or doesn’t 
like bacon, I don’t see the issue.
Dear Mediocre Advice,
I met a super adorable guy yesterday who owns 
a tea shop below my building. I went in, and he gave me a free cup of tea and sat down next to me to chat for a while. It was all innocent, but there was definitely some flirtation happening. He didn’t ask for my number, but I really want to bone him. Will I look like a creepy stalker if I go in again today—and every other day—until he gets the message? 
What’s a girl gotta do to get laid around here?
Dear Friend,
Pursuing someone who was nice and flirtatious does 
not make you a creep. People don’t just give free sh-t away to people they’ve never met. He was attracted to you, and that free cup of tea was the ice breaker. Just be -
cause he didn’t make a move right then and there doesn’t mean he’s not interested. There is such a thing as a build-up. Stop by every once in a while, keep playing it cool, and see where it goes—probably to your mattress in the next few weeks. Whenever you get sick of drinking tea 
solely to hang out with him, make a move. 
� SEASON 9 AIRS ON ABC.

It was only a matter of time—
measured by thornless roses and 
bad elevator music—before Desiree Hartsock’s heart was shattered.
But like a phoenix rising from the 
ashes, she appeared sans bangs, with airbrushed skin and 25 men swoon-ing at her ﬁ  ngertips. Hartsock was named ABC’s leading lady of “The Bachelorette,” Season 9.
Many of you are probably think-ing about moving on to the next article because you think this show is stupid. Well, hold your horses — that means you Lindzi Cox — and take a few minutes to consider why you should watch this season of “The Bachelorette”:
1. Sexy men — Bachelor Nation: 
Remember when Sean Lowe took his shirt off for Emily Maynard’s friends at that glorious group date last season? Every woman in Amer-ica died. If you are a more recent fol-lower of the show, check out Season 9, episode 4: ripped bodies, spray tans and washboard abs — totally worth your time.2.  Sexy baby blue Bentley — One 
of the many mysteries of this sea-son is the Bentley Convertible that Hartsock has been cruising around Los Angeles in. Did ABC give this to her? Is this part of her paycheck that comes with the title of bachelorette? Will we ever know? In any case, it’s fun to speculate.
3.  Sweet date ideas — Hey, guys: 
Wanna see why your lady isn’t swooning over the same old dinner-and-a-movie date you planned last week? Well, tune in to “The Bach-elorette” Monday to see why. Next time, consider dancing on the side of a building, competing against other burly men in a highly physical game of dodgeball, or — a “Bachelor” classic — jumping out of a helicopter. Per-
haps you could model a Speedo like the guys did a few weeks ago in their Mr. America competition — but, please, only if you have a body like Zak W., thanks. 
4. Conducive to psychoanalysis 
— I know I am not the only one who secretly thinks all of these men are a tad deranged. It’s particularly fun to speculate who will be chosen in the end based off the tiny glimpses of these guys’ personalities we get as viewers.  Anyone want to take a stab at why Ben seems like such a secre-tive creep or how Brian came to be such a great liar?
5. Grown men make complete 
fools of themselves — Soulja Boy made an appearance on week two and required all of the less-than-gangsta bachelors to rap and dance in a music video called “For the Right Reasons,” which is about — you guessed it — being on the show for the right reasons. And yes, there is a video of this madness on www.ABC.go.com.

A special show was slated for 
the previous “Free Friday” concert 
at Bo Diddley Community Plaza to celebrate Independence Day. It was the first installment of the concept themed after the NPR show, “A Prairie Home Companion.” Taking a Gainesville spin, it was renamed “The All-American Payne’s Prai-rie Home Companion,” a clever shout-out to the marshland south of town.
Russell Etling, programs coordi-
nator at City of Gainesville Depart-ment of Parks, Recreation and Cul-tural Affairs, said the type of music played at the events includes rock, psychedelic, folk and reggae.
The concerts “are provided free 
of charge by Gainesville to bring a better quality of life through the arts,” Etling said. “It showcases the scope of talent in the community.” 
I arrived at the plaza at 7:30 p.m. with 30 minutes to kill. A large number of people — with lawn chairs erected and blankets un-folded — had already positioned themselves on the grassy area in front of the stage. I walked toward the Lunchbox, a brick restaurant with outside seating that skirts the plaza. The sweet potato nug-gets with citrus dipping sauce and chocolate-covered frozen banana with roasted coconut flakes were both satisfying, but I thought the sweet potatoes were overpriced. 
Finishing my eats while sitting 
on the concrete slab beneath the overhang of the joint, I somewhat unwittingly steered into an inter-view with a stranger to my right. He introduced himself as Phil Den-ton.
“I work for Visit Gainesville,” 
he said. “It’s basically the tourist bureau of the town.”
“So what brings you out here 
tonight?” I asked.“Well, I’m really just interested 
in knowing what’s available,” he said as he motioned toward a stack of coupons he’d picked up at one of the few tent vendors, calling them his passport. “Coupons work, cou-pons work, coupons work,” he re-joiced.
I smiled at his quip. “Well do 
you know much about the show tonight?”
“I saw it in the paper,” Denton 
said, “but don’t remember much about it – it looks like a real mixed age group.”
He got into rehashing — nostal-
gically — the folk music scene of the 1960s, calling it “the summer of love.” After realizing it futile to rein him in from his wistful reminis-cence, I parted with a handshake.
I positioned myself to the right 
of the plaza on a bench, the old courthouse to my back. Large ever-expanding rain clouds threatened overhead. That didn’t seem to sway the crowd, as I estimated about 200 people were milling about, wait-ing. The stage was ready to go.
Almost in unison, the show 
kicked off and the rain started, slow and light. Raincoats were adorned and umbrellas opened. Some spec-tators made their way beneath the eaves of the stage, but most stayed put — unfazed by the drizzle.
Introductions were made, a skit 
was done and the first band, Quar-ter Moon, managed to get through a few songs. The rain picked up its pace and thickened. 
A man in a red jumpsuit, who 
was involved with the show, joked, “We didn’t think we’d actually be bringing the prairie to you all.”
A little less than an hour in, 
most everything was drenched. The crowd, most of whom had held out, rapidly dispersed. 
Ron Thomas, the emcee of the 
event and a guiding force behind the project, was heading to pack everything up before the rain in-tensified.
“For the past four years or so, 
around the Fourth of July, we’ve put together all-American song fests,” Thomas said. “It’s gone through all those permutations — thought I’d try something new this year.”
I said it was disappointing they 
had to stop the show early. “Is this something you’re going to try and invoke again?” I asked.
“Some mention’s been made 
that we might do it at the Thomas Center, indoors. So we’ll see if we can arrange a date for that,” he said.

Gainesville’s monsoon season 
is in full swing, and that means it’s 
time for indoor yoga, time to curl up with a decent book or time to induce cerebral atrophy by being sucked into a Netflix marathon. This article is for those interested in the latter.
With the onset of incoming col-
lege freshmen and the melancholy of returning students, now is the time to pay tribute to our squandered youth. What better way than with a coming-of-age movie marathon. 
What to watch: “Happy Togeth-
er”
Why to watch: “Happy Togeth-er” is the story of two men who leave China to reconcile their turbulent re-lationship on holiday in Argentina. The movie’s themes focus on the na-ture of destructive relationships be-tween people who are intellectually and emotionally incompatible but sexually irresistible to each other. 
To the jilted college senior, this 
motif is entirely relatable. If you’re a bright-eyed freshman optimistic to find love within these ivory towers, let this be an indicator of warning signs you’ll inevitably encounter. 
The film’s lovers try again and 
again to reconcile their relationship to no avail. The film’s appeal is its ability to bring the viewer to ques-tion how much we are able to en-dure for another person in the name of sex and love. Who, after all, will respect us if we can’t respect our-selves?
What to watch: “Young and 
Wild”
Why to watch: College is a time 
for experimentation and an oppor-tunity for some to realize who they are. What better way to do that than by exercising your sexuality as an extension of your identity? “Young and Wild” follows the life of Daniela — a teenage girl living in Santiago, Chile — after she is expelled from her religious high school for having premarital sex. 
The film explores how our bud-
ding consciousness is shaped as we navigate the contentious relation-ship between sex and religion and how our most basic human impuls-es clash with societal expectations of what is deemed “acceptable.” 
Daniela un-
derstands herself as a sexual being capable of happi-ness with either sex. The film’s ap-peal lies in what 
happens in any relationship after the initial appeal of sex has worn off and compatibility comes into play. 
What to watch: “Submarine”Why to watch: “Submarine” is a 
bit more formulaic, but why do we feel the need to escape into film if not for the occasional need for com-fort and reassurance? 
“Submarine” is the story of Oli-
ver Tate, a 15-year-old boy obsessed with losing his virginity to his high school crush, a dark and sardonic girl named Jordana. The film’s charm lies in Tate’s sincerity, as his naivety is a welcome departure from the insincerity that clouds his daily life in the dreary British backdrop. Tate comes to understand that infidelity and compulsion is not restricted to just adolescence. The movie’s com-fort lies in the fact that, in spite of life’s inevitable obstacles, if we re-ally love something, we’ll find a way to make it work despite any and all complications that ensue.

Aaron Hernandez is no 
longer be a member of the 
New England Patriots or this year’s version of EA Sports’ Madden NFL, but the former Gator still has his name ce-mented in front of the James W. “Bill” Heavener football complex – for now. 
A UF spokesman said the 
school had not discussed re-moving the brick because much of the administration is not in Gainesville.
The University of Florida 
awarded Hernandez with an All-American brick for his efforts during his 2010 cam-paign. 
The brick remains despite 
the recent allegations against Hernandez.. 
Bricks are awarded to Flor-
ida players who have earned first-team All-America honors and are located on the Gator Walk entrance in front of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
It is unclear whether the 
University Athletic Associa-tion will continue to acknowl-edge his success on the field given his recent involvement in the death of former semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd. 
Hernan-
dez is cur-rently being held with-out bail af-
ter pleading not guilty to first-degree murder and five fire-
arms-related charges. Hernan-dez is also being investigated in connection with a double murder that took place in June of 2012, and is currently involved in a lawsuit in which he was accused of shooting an individual in his right eye. 
As a junior in 2009, Hernan-
dez was recognized as both a first-team All-American and All-Southeastern Conference selection. He led the Gators in receptions with 68 for 850 yards and five touchdowns, and was awarded the John Mackey Award given annu-ally to college football’s best tight end. 
In the 2009 BCS National 
Championship, Hernandez led Florida with 57 reception yards on five catches to oust the Oklahoma Sooners 24-14. After his junior season he elected to forgo his final year at Florida to enter the 2010 NFL Draft, where he was se-lected 113th overall by New England. 
In his three seasons with the 
Patriots, Hernandez racked up 175 receptions for 1,956 yards and 18 touchdowns. In 2011, Hernandez and teammate Rob Gronkowski set NFL re-cords for yardage, receptions and touchdowns by a pair of tight ends on a single team.

  Billy Donovan said Wednesday 
that he has not yet heard any ruling 
from the NCAA Clearinghouse con-cerning Chris Walker’s academic eligibility. 
  Walker is not in Gainesville for 
the Summer B semester. He is cur-rently working on completing on-line courses so he can be academi-cally cleared to play.  
  “The one thing that we’ve tried 
to explain to him is the work that he’s ﬁ  nishing up and doing, he doesn’t need to rush it,” Donovan said. “He just needs to get it done correctly, the right way. I think he’s working hard, trying to make sure that happens.” 
  The 6-foot-10 Walker, a McDon-
ald’s All-American, is the No. 6 re-cruit in the Class of 2013, according to Rivals.com.
  “We’re hopeful that it’ll be soon-
er than later, but he’s still got some work ahead of him,” Donovan said. “I think he’s trying really hard to get all that ﬁ  nished … He may or may not be here for fall semester. The one thing I feel like with Chris is that, just talking to him, is his com-mitment to Florida and wanting to be here. He wants to make that hap-pen.”
  Donovan also said he has not 
been in touch with Rutgers about transfer guard Eli Carter’s eligibil-ity. In the aftermath of the Mike Rice scandal, Carter is hoping to re-ceive clearance from Rutgers and a waiver from the NCAA to play for the Gators this season. Carter has yet to ﬁ  le an appeal.
  “I really have stayed out of it,” 
Donovan said. “It’s something that Eli and his family need to do.”
  Wilbekin still suspended: Se-
nior Scottie Wilbekin (indeﬁ  nite suspension) will not be a member of the team for the rest of the summer, Donovan said Wednesday. 
  “I’ll probably sit down and meet 
with him once the fall semester starts and go from there,” Donovan said. 
  Florida suspended Wilbekin, 
the Gators’ starting point guard last season, on June 10 for violating team rules. Under the terms of his suspen-sion, he cannot participate in team activities at UF’s basketball practice facility until he is reinstated. 
  Florida also suspended Wilbekin 
on Nov. 8 for breaking team rules. He served a three-game suspension and returned to the team in mid-November. 
  “He’s got a row to hoe here a 
little bit, to get himself back,” Dono-van said. “There’s some things out there in front of him that he needs to do now. He’s working hard and trying to do those things.
  “This is not a situation where 
this is going to be something that’s all of a sudden just going to be a quick ﬁ  x.”
  Yeguete, Young healing: Dono-
van said he expects forward Will Yeguete (right knee) to be ready for the start of fall practices. 
  On May 22, Yeguete underwent 
arthroscopic debridement on his knee – his second surgery on his right knee in a four-month span. After the procedure, doctors listed Yeguete’s time of recovery at about four months. 
  Yeguete no longer has to wear a 
restrictive right leg brace, Donovan said. The 6-foot-7 senior is currently walking on crutches. 
  “It’s going to be a long road for 
him – just the recovery, just the length of time – because of the sur-gery,” Donovan said. “But in terms of the healing process and him be-ing back and him … being ready to play this year, I feel totally optimis-tic about that.”
  Donovan also said center Patric 
Young (right ankle) is “progressing ﬁ  ne.” Young underwent surgery on April 12 to remove a bone spur from his ankle. He was not in Gainesville during Summer A but is currently working out with the team.

THE ALLIGATOR AWARDS
  As part of the Alligator Awards recog-
nizing the best in UF athletics during the 2012-13 season, columnists Phil 
Heilman and Adam Lichtenstein will debate two of the ﬁ  ve nominees in each week’s cat-egory. Vote for the winner online at alligator-Sports.org.
    Adam: Florida’s basketball team re-
turned three prominent seniors who had the chance to make their ﬁ  nal season in Gainesville noteworthy, but one player stood out above the rest – Erik Murphy.
  The 6-foot-10 forward had a troubled 
start to his Gators career both on and off the court, but he excelled in 2012-13. 
  Murphy saw his career prospects dras-
tically improve in his ﬁ  nal season. After an arrest in 2011 and one start in his freshman and sophomore seasons combined, he took off last season.
  The senior ﬁ  nished the year second 
on the team in points per game and third in rebounds, but outpaced the rest of the starters in shooting percentage (with the exception of Patric Young, whose most common shot was near the boards).  He also led the Southeastern Conference in three-point shooting percentage.  While other 
players occasion-ally outshone him on the court, Mur-phy was the con-sistent backbone that led the Gators deep into the tour-nament.
  
Phil: While I agree with you that Murphy did an admirable job repairing his reputa-tion and becoming a dependable player for Billy Donovan last season, he was only one of many important cogs on a team that did not truly feature any star players.
  Mike Gillislee, however, was the engine 
that drove the football team.
  Finally given an opportunity to show-
case his ability, Gillislee rushed 244 times for 1,152 yards — good for the seventh-best output in Gators history — and scored 11 total touchdowns.
  How often does that happen? Gillislee 
was the ﬁ  rst UF running back to eclipse the 1,000-yard mark since Ciatrick Fason accomplished the feat in 2004.
  Speaking of ’04, remember when the Boston Red Sox came back from 3-0 down in the American League Championship series and eventually won the World Series? Good times.
    A d a m :  There’s actu-
ally a blank spot in my memory where 2004 
should be. And “Fever Pitch” ends with Drew Barrymore running on the ﬁ  eld.
  And while Gillislee did a lot of running 
on Florida Field, that running still didn’t amount to much in the grand scheme of 
things – the Gators ﬁ  nished 103rd in total 
offense last year. If any group is to thank 
for Florida’s success, it’s the defense.
  Although Gillislee had one of the best 
seasons for a Gators running back, com-pared to the rest of the nation, he was “only” above average. 
  He ﬁ  nished his season 44th in the na-
tion in yards per game -- behind ﬁ  ve quar-terbacks (six if you count Denard Robin-son as a quarterback).
  Meanwhile, Murphy was a top offen-
sive contributor. Kenpom.com has Mur-phy ranked 17th in the nation in effective ﬁ  eld-goal percentage, which weighs three-point shots over two-point shots.
  Murphy was like the David Ortiz of 
the Gators last season – the best offensive 
player on a team with multiple solid con-tributors. 
  Gillislee was like Robinson Cano on 
this year’s Yankees – the only star player 
on an offensive unit that needs all the help it can get in order to score.
  Phil: Gillislee’s raw numbers, though 
impressive in the UF record books, do not especially grab your attention in relation to the rest of the college football land-scape. I get that. 
That said, you have to take into account 
what he was working with.
  Florida’s passing offense ﬁ  nished the 
season averaging 143.9 yards per game. If that sounds like a low number, that’s because it was. In fact, it was the lowest total in the SEC by more than 10 yards per game.
  Gillislee faced eight-man fronts, nine-
man fronts and was the sole focus of op-

Murphy, Gillislee played for highly ranked teams last year
posing defenses throughout the 
season.
When Jeff Driskel ran for 177 
yards and three touchdowns against Vanderbilt, Commodores coach James Franklin said his team essentially spent the whole week preparing for Gillislee, leav-ing them susceptible elsewhere. And that is what every single op-ponent did. 
Still, Gillislee racked up yard-
age like the Yankees have been racking up losses this season. It was impressive to watch.
Adam: Well you just made 
my own point. The Yankees are somehow six games over .500 de-spite playing with spare parts.
And speaking of spare parts, 
that’s what Gillislee is going to be with the Dolphins. 
Miami picked him in the fifth 
round, right before it took kicker Caleb Sturgis. Gillislee was the 13th running back taken in the draft (14th if you count Denard Robinson as a running back). Gil-lislee was the sixth Gator taken.
In an NBA Draft where teams 
can select fewer players, Mur-phy still showed enough value to draw the attention of an NBA team. He was the only Gator picked. He was the most valuable player on a Florida male roster. 
Phil: The Best Male Athlete award is essentially declaring who is the Most Valuable male Player on campus in one year.
Sure, Murphy had a respect-
able regular season. However, the difference came during pro-gram-defining moments.
Florida football had fallen off 
the national landscape for sever-al years prior to last season. The first chance to re-establish that luster came against No. 4 LSU in The Swamp on Oct. 6.
In a game that had all the mak-
ings of another gut-wrenching defeat, Gillislee was the differ-ence for the Gators. 
After being shut out in the first 
half, Florida rode him to a pair of touchdowns — one in each the third and fourth quarter — and captured a 14-6 win and signal a power shift in the SEC.
Seven weeks later, Gillislee 
replicated his performance by rushing for 140 yards and a pair of scores in a 37-26 victory against Florida State –  a win that not 
only snapped a two-year losing streak to the Seminoles, but also kept the Gators in the running for a national championship.
When Murphy had the op-
portunity to help his team fi-nally escape the Elite Eight after failng the two previous years, he came up painfully short. In a 79-59 blowout loss to Michigan, he ended his college career with 0 points on 0-of-11 shooting.
Each player had a tremen-
dous year, but Gillislee overcame a higher degree of difficulty to shine consistently. 
That’s why he deserves the 
award.
