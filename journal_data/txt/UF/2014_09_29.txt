Charlie Crist pulled up to the 
Alachua County Ofﬁ  ce of the State 
Attorney building late afternoon 
Sunday in a black Mercedes-Benz 
before being greeted by a crowd of supporters eagerly waiting outside in the muggy air.  
In a small room decorated 
with campaign signs and stick-ers, Crist spoke of his plans for Florida.
“We are the opposite of Rick 
Scott,” he said to the crowd of about 50 people inside. “I even have hair.”
Wearing a white dress shirt 
and a mint-green tie with blue and white stripes, Crist told the group he supports equality for women.
“I support a woman’s right to 
choose,” he said.
He spoke of affordable health-
care, expanding Medicaid, pre-serving Florida’s springs, in-creasing minimum wage and enhancing the education system.
Crist encouraged the crowd to 
vote and motivate their friends and family to be active voters as well.
“I want you to be represent-
ed,” he said. “I want your voice 
to be heard.”
He said to utilize social media, 
knock on doors and pick up the 
phone and make calls, encourag-
ing others to vote as well.
“It’s on you,” he said. “It’s on 
all of us. It is our campaign. It’s 
not my campaign. It’s our cam-paign. It’s the people’s campaign. 
If you vote, we win, and we’ll 
have our Florida back.”
Standing behind the building’s 
parking lot packed with cars, a 
small group of protesters stood 
with signs that read, “CHARLIE SWINDLED STUDENTS” and “Charlie RAISED my tuition!”
Sen. Rob Bradley, R-Fla., 
joined protesters in his navy blue suit jacket, sweat sticking to his forehead.
“I am proud to stand with Gov. 
Scott,” he said. “I’m here today to stand up for Florida’s students.”

Students can fuel up on free coffee 
on their way to class today from local 
coffee shops participating in National Coffee Day.
The Dunkin’ Donuts on West Uni-
versity Avenue is giving away me-dium cups of its new dark roast coffee from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m., said overnight manager Alexis Lyons.  
Krispy Kreme is offering free 12-
ounce coffees or mochas, lattes and iced coffees for $1, according to the company website. Kangaroo Express is also selling cups of its Bean Street Cof-fee for a penny from 6 to 10 a.m.
“This will help us promote our new 
coffee, and supporting National Coffee Day is always a plus for Dunkin’ Do-
nuts,” Lyons said.
She said students can also enjoy any 
hot or iced coffee for $1 during happy 
hour, which is from 3 to 6 p.m. every day.
Meg Marger, 20, said she goes to 
Dunkin’ Donuts for coffee once or twice a week. The UF English junior said she’d grab a free cup if she’s in the area, but she’d rather pay $1 for hap-py-hour coffee any day.
“Since it’s all day, there’s a chance I 
would stop in,” Marger said.Free coffee today for

A woman said she was followed by a 
man who matched the description of the UF 
assault suspect near the Hub early Sunday, 
setting off a string of UF alerts at about 1 
a.m.
Gainesville Police responded after re-
ceiving a call from the woman’s friend who 
reported the incident. 
Police said the female was intoxicated 
when she told ofﬁ  cers she was cutting 
through campus after an off-campus party and noticed a 6-foot white male following 
her.
When she tried to walk faster, she said 
the man picked up his pace. 
The man never caught up or made con-
tact with her, according to a joint release 
from GPD and University Police.
Once she crossed campus and made it 
home, the woman told ofﬁ  cers she locked herself inside and called her friend.
When ofﬁ  cers arrived at the location, 
they said the woman’s story changed sev-eral times.
Police did not locate the man.Victoria Alsina, 18, lives in Rawlings 
Hall and said she has been more careful since the attacks began Aug. 30. 
The advertising freshman purchased 
pepper spray and said she uses Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol or walks in groups after dusk.
“At night, I deﬁ  nitely am more para-
noid,” she said, “but I usually don’t go out alone.”UF alerts of woman followedSEE CRIST, PAGE 4

Group to vaccinate 200K Florida 
students for free
JACKSONVILLE — A Florida 
organization is helping to provide 
free flu vaccinations to 200,000 stu-dents this school year.
Families Fighting Flu and 
Healthy Schools LLC will give chil-dren around the state the opportu-nity to get the nasal-inhaled vaccine whether or not they have insurance. The initiative started this month.
Flu rates among children are typ-
ically higher than other populations, and they tend to spread the virus more easily. Florida’s flu vaccina-tion rates are below the average.
The groups say approximately 
20,000 children nationwide are hos-pitalized, and 100 children die due to influenza. Children also miss 
more than 38 million days of school 
each year because of the flu.
Healthy Schools was founded by 
former Jacksonville Jaguars offen-sive tackle Tony Boselli. Last year, the organization vaccinated 11,000 children.
Man who raised $55K for potato 
salad throws party
COLUMBUS, Ohio — An Ohio 
man who raised $55,000 in a joking crowdfunding appeal to pay for his first attempt at making potato salad threw a huge public party Saturday that promised “peace, love and po-tato salad.”
PotatoStock 2014 was held in 
downtown Columbus and featured 
bands, food trucks, beer vendors 
and, yes, plenty of potato salad. With more than 3,000 pounds of potatoes, the charity-minded party was open to people of all ages.
Zack Brown had jokingly sought 
$10 on Kickstarter in July to buy potato salad ingredients, but his mission drew global attention and 
earned tens of thousands of dollars.
The Idaho Potato Commission 
and corporate sponsors donated po-
tato salad supplies for the party.Brown is partnering with the Co-
lumbus Foundation to support char-ities that fight hunger and home-lessness. The account started with $20,000 in post-campaign corporate 
donations and will grow after pro-
ceeds from PotatoStock are added.
“His fund will have potential 
way after this potato salad is forgot-ten,” Lisa Jolley, the foundation’s di-rector of donors and development, told The Columbus Dispatch.
Brown told the newspaper that 
he intends to “do the most good that 
I can.”
Man charged after turtles found 
beneath clothing
DETROIT — A Canadian man has been charged after border agents 
at the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel found more than 50 turtles strapped to his body and hidden between his legs.
The Detroit News reports that 
Windsor, Ontario, resident Kai Xu was charged Wednesday with smuggling, illegal trading and ex-porting. A bond hearing was sched-uled Thursday in federal court in Detroit.
A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
agent received a tip about a large box sent to a Detroit postal center. Court 
documents say it was addressed 
to Xu and mailed from Alabama. Agents were watching the postal center on Aug. 5 when Xu arrived.MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Gainesville organizations are 
reaching out to help the growing 
Florida homeless student popula-tion.
According to the U.S. Depart-
ment of Education, a record 69,956 homeless students attended Flor-ida’s schools in the 2012-2013 aca-demic school year.St. Francis House, a shelter for 
those seeking housing, provides re-sources for homeless students.
St. Francis House kitchen man-
ager Jason Robles said he has seen people in the shelter as young as 2 
months old. He also sees people in 
their teenage years.
To pursue a higher education, 
Robles said it depends on the stu-dents’ mindset and demeanor.
“Each person individually is dif-
ferent. Every challenge is different,” he said. “It all depends on how they see life.”
Homeless students can take advantage of the shelter’s tutor-ing services, clothing vouchers and laundry facilities, according to St. Francis’ website.
UF offers resources for students 
in need of assistance.
“UF is currently creating a Food 
Pantry,” Jen Day Shaw wrote in an email. Groups across campus, in-cluding the Dean of Students Office, Student Government, Aramark and the College of Engineering, are con-tributing to the effort.
UF mechanical engineering 
sophomore Vishnu Sriram said 
mentoring services can be a helpful resource for homeless students.  
Sriram, 18, said he volunteers 
with the homeless and does not see 
homeless college students.
“I would imagine in Gainesville, 
there is a significant homeless popu-
lation,” he said. “I don’t think a lot of 
them are displaced out of college.”
U Matter, We Care caters to stu-dents dealing with crises. The or-ganization  helps students find ser-vices such as UF Housing and Gator Dining.
Gator Dining production man-
ager Dorian Baskerville said he per-
sonally tries to help homeless youth. 
Baskerville visited soup kitchens in his hometown.
He said helping out hits home be-
cause he was in danger of becoming homeless at one point. He suggested holding a community breakfast for homeless youth and students.
“It’s our duty as human beings to 
help out others.”
Homelessness rates high in Florida, but not among UF students

is different. Every challenge

A local Checkers is now offering student dis-
counts and supporting local organizations.
The double drive-thru restaurant at 912 W. 
University Ave. now grants different discounts 
for students who show their Gator 1 Card. On Sundays and Mondays, students will receive a free ice cream cone with the purchase of com-
bos one through four on the menu. On Tuesdays 
and Wednesdays, they will get 10 percent off any combo.
The promotion started Sunday and will run 
through the end of the year, said the restaurant’s 
general manager Leeann Lamb.
“I think it would really help not just us, but 
it’d be a good thing for the students,” Lamb 
said. “When the kids first come in, they’ve got to move in. They, a lot of times, don’t have their 
grant money or whatever yet, you know? No 
money is coming in. I feel like it’s something that’s going to help them out. They’re running off a low amount of money.”
Monique Puentes, a  women’s studies fresh-
man at UF, said she would be more likely to eat at restaurants in close proximity to campus if they offered student discounts.
“Saving money is very important to me, and 
I try to use as many coupons and take advan-tage of deals,” Puentes, 18, said. “They are one of the few fast food restaurants that don’t try to make it seem like they are being more healthy and downsizing their portions. If I’m going to 
a fast food restaurant, I’m obviously not trying 
to watch my calories, so I might as well splurge and eat all of the extras, like cheese and bacon.”
The student discounts are just one way Lamb 
said she is working to make Checkers a valued member of the Gainesville community. She said the store is supporting the Alachua County Li-brary District’s Summer Reading Program and various local PTA programs with thousands of 
free coupons. Checkers was also on the Gator 
Stompin’ menu for the first time in the Spring.
“Gainesville is a very tight-knit community, 
and we need to be part of the community,” Lamb 
said. “We’re not just a fast food restaurant that’s 
hanging out on University. We’re a member of the community.”Downtown Checkers now offers

Democrats. She represents the Hispanic sector within 
her organization and said 
she hopes to get students as politically involved as pos-sible.
“Just him coming here

FERGUSON, Missouri — Au-
thorities searched Sunday for two 
men suspected of shooting and wounding a police officer in Fergu-son, Missouri, the St. Louis suburb 
where there have been angry pro-
tests since a white officer fatally shot an unarmed 18-year-old black man last month.
Although there were two sepa-
rate protests about the Aug. 9 shoot-ing of Michael Brown happening around the time the officer was shot Saturday night, St. Louis County Po-
lice Chief Jon Belmar said he didn’t 
think they were related in any way to the attack on the officer.
The men fled when the officer 
approached them at around 9 p.m. because the community center they were standing outside of was closed, Belmar said at a news conference early Sunday. When the officer gave chase, one of the men turned and shot him in the arm, he said.
Belmar said the officer is expected 
to survive, but he didn’t identify the officer or give further details about his condition. He said the officer re-turned fire but there’s no indication that either suspect was shot.
The shooting comes amid sim-
mering tension between many com-munity members and the police in Ferguson, where two-thirds of the 
residents are black, but only three 
of the city’s 53 police officers are African-American. The shooting of Brown and police response to the protests stoked a national discourse about police tactics and race.
At about midnight Saturday, 
about two dozen officers stood near a group of about 100 protesters who 
mingled on a street corner, occasion-
ally shouting “No justice, no peace.” By Sunday afternoon, the streets of Ferguson were quiet, with no visible signs of police or protesters.
Police had closed part of a near-
by street as helicopters and officers 
from several law enforcement agen-
cies canvassed the area in search of the two suspects.
Earlier Saturday, Brown’s parents 
told The Associated Press they were unmoved by a videotaped apology released days earlier by Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson, whose attempt to march with protesters 
Thursday sparked a clash that led to 
several arrests.
When asked whether Jackson 
should be fired, Brown’s mother, Lesley McSpadden, said he should. Brown’s father, Michael Brown Sr., said rather than an apology, they would like Darren Wilson to be ar-rested.
A county grand jury is weighing 
whether to indict Wilson in Brown’s shooting.

The National Eating Disorders Association 
has implemented a new online program to 
serve college students dealing with body im-age confidence.
A survey conducted by the association, as 
a part of its Collegiate Survey Project, found that greater resources are needed to educate, screen, refer and treat students.
Proud2Bme On Campus was launched as 
a nationwide initiative to combat eating disor-ders and spread awareness. By bringing stu-dents, faculty and campus services together, Proud2Bme plans to fight the eating disorder epidemic at multiple colleges and universities 
across the nation.
Shannon Johnson, a UF dietetics senior, said programs like this would make a differ-
ence for students.
“A lot of college students already have this 
pressure from the society, media and culture around them to look a certain way,” Johnson, 22, said.
The online program features a variety of 
services, including screenings, how-to guides, toolkits, professional advice and forums.
Early detection could be a problem solver, 
said Christine Moreno, a UF microbiology and cell science senior.
“It’s nice that from the privacy of your own 
home, someone can check if they are at risk for an eating disorder,” Moreno, 22, said. “Then they can go from there to prevent the disorder from getting out of hand.”
If students are struggling with food or ex-
ercise issues, they are urged to take an eating disorder screening on the website, which is kept confidential at all times.
Dr. Amelia Davis, a physician at the UF 
Health Eating Disorder Recovery Center, wrote in an email that the screenings could be a good way for someone to see if their symp-toms may be consistent with an eating disor-der.
“(The screening) can then hopefully en-
courage that person to seek an evaluation and possible treatment from an eating disorder specialist,” Davis said. “The longer someone suffers, the more the thoughts and behaviors become ingrained and more difficult to treat.”
Proud2BMe strives to offer eating disorder education, resources and support on all col-lege campuses to help students with eating and body image concerns.
The initiative hopes to empower individu-
als to make changes in their lives and inspire communities to create healthier role models for others struggling with eating disorders.
With the online component of Proud2Bme, 
the National Eating Disorders Association is in the process of developing on-campus pro-grams that could appear in colleges as early as February.
“By providing education in the commu-
nity and increasing general awareness, there is greater likelihood that someone will recognize someone (either themselves, a close friend or family member) who has an eating disorder and help refer that person for help,” Davis said.
GatorWell encourages students coping 
with an eating disorder to reach out for help 
and contact the UF Counseling & Wellness 
Center’s eating disorders program.

Annette Taddeo picked oranges from her 
family’s grove and sold them to neighbors in 
Colombia when she was 13 years old. Her en-trepreneurial spirit led her to found one of the top 100 small businesses in Florida, Languag-
eSpeak, after moving to Miami at 18.
Taddeo is running for Florida’s lieutenant 
governor alongside Democratic candidate 
Charlie Crist, and UF is her next stop.
Taddeo will speak at Hispanic Heritage 
Month’s two-part forum “It’s Our Story. It’s Our Time. It’s Our Voices” today at 7 p.m. in Pugh Hall Ocora. If elected, she will become the first female Hispanic lieutenant governor, assisting the governor with duties in the ex-
ecutive branch.
Taddeo, the current Miami-Dade Demo-
cratic Party chairwoman, will focus on her life 
as a Hispanic businesswoman, mother and political leader.
“We want to hear what she has to say as 
a Latina who has a strong voice in an area that many people of color do not,” said Liana Guerra, president of the Hispanic Student As-sociation.Organized by UF stu-
dents Brenda Hernandez and Yareliz Mendez-Zamo-ra, the forum aims to inspire 
students through Taddeo’s 
story on making the Ameri-can dream a reality.
“She will be talking 
about her story and who 
she is, not as a candidate, 
but as a person,” said Mendez-Zamora, a 20-

Eleven UF students are fi-
nalizing travel plans to east-
ern Virginia, where the group 
will research past and present 
oral traditions in the field this October.
The students will travel 
with UF senior research staff member Diana Dombrowski for the Samuel Proctor Oral History Program. The five-day trip begins Oct. 21.
A handful of the students 
conceptualized the research project, formally known as A Festival of Oral History and 
Folklore. 
“We were sitting in class, 
talking about how cool it 
would be to interview people about their ghost stories near 
Halloween,” said Jessica Tay-
lor, a graduate coordinator for the program. 
Austyn Szempruch, a 
UF history junior from Na-ples, Florida, said the group thought “about what we’d like to do for future projects and places we might like to 
go and research.”
Eastern Virginia, he said, 
was agreed upon as a “terrific 
idea.”With recent economic 
decline and erosion of the Chesapeake Bay marine envi-ronment, the fishing industry in eastern Virginia is facing 
great adversity.
“Eastern Virginia is really 
special because it’s on the 
cusp of future development, 
and it’s important to help 
people preserve the trades that are associated with ma-
rine art,” Taylor said. “They 
want us to come up there, so that’s really great, too. It’s not so much a UF initiative as much as it is an initiative 
on the part of Virginians who 
want to help.”
This research project will 
cost $7,400 and is funded in part by UF sources. 
“This project is important 
because it’s crucial that it be done now,” Taylor said. “With the death of the com-mercial fishing industry, that 
means that fewer people are 
going into it.” 
She said the youngest crab-
ber the group has interviewed so far is 45 years old, and the 
man said he was not planning 
on passing down his skills to any of his children.
“For a lot of these guys, 
they want to be able to share their craft,” she said.Eleven UF students to

A Gainesville man was arrested 
Saturday night after police said he 
grabbed his girlfriend and refused 
to let her go, despite her screaming and struggling.
Ryan Walters, 26, was arrested 
at about 9:30 p.m. on charges of battery for dating violence and re-sisting an officer without violence.
Police observed Walters and the 
victim arguing before she tried to 
run away at 1620 W. University 
Ave. Walters grabbed the victim and held her as she repeatedly said, “Ryan, let me go.”
She repeatedly tried to push away and free 
herself from Walters’ grip, the report stated.
Officers ap-
proached Walters and the victim, ordering Walters to let her go.
Walters re-
fused and continued to restrain the victim before officers tossed him to the ground and arrested him.

MIAMI — A shooting sent terrified patrons 
scrambling from a Miami nightclub early Sun-
day and left 15 people wounded, including an 11-year-old child, authorities said.
When Miami police and rescue crews ar-
rived at a club called The Spot around 1 a.m., they said they found chaos among the large throng of adults and teenagers gathered there. Rescuers found wounded people inside and outside the club, some too hurt to flee, Miami Fire Rescue Capt. Ignatius Carroll said.
One person was reported in critical condi-
tion, and the other victims remaining in the 
hospital were in “stable” condition, said po-
lice spokeswoman Frederica Burden, without elaborating.
Some people were running, “people were 
screaming, people were saying they were shot,” Carroll said, adding others were yelling for help for friends who had been shot.
One male was found unresponsive and 
not breathing when emergency responders ar-rived. Five girls between 11 and 17 years old 
also suffered gunshot wounds, Carroll said.
Details were sparse in the hours after the 
shooting. Investigators sought to piece togeth-
er what happened in what was described as a scene of confusion.“The investigators are still interviewing 
witnesses. They’re going from hospital to hos-pital,” Burden said, noting that the victims had been cooperative.
She said it was not immediately clear how 
many shooters were involved or what prompt-ed the violence.
Police had not made any arrests as of Sun-
day afternoon and had not publicly identified any suspects. Police: 15 hurt, including 11-year-old, in Miami nightclub shootingCAMPUS

Scott’s teacher 
debit cards show 
bad policy
One of the most shameful aspects of the public edu-
cation system in America is the need for teachers to spend large sums of their own money to provide 
school supplies for their classrooms. 
Forbes reported that during the 2013-2014 school year, U.S. 
teachers spent an average of $513 out of pocket on purchases of 
school supplies.
Gov. Rick Scott and the Florida Legislature attempted to ad-
dress this issue by enacting a publicly funded debit card pro-gram for the state’s teachers. The debit cards, worth $250 each, would allow teachers to purchase much-needed supplies for their students without having to spend as much of their own 
income.
Unfortunately, the program’s implementation has left much 
to be desired. Although the school year started in mid-August, 
Florida’s teachers just received their debit cards last week.
Obviously, by this point, many teachers have already pur-
chased the necessary school supplies for their classrooms. Given the ill-conceived nature of the program, it’s not surprising that only seven of the state’s 67 school districts signed up.
Despite the debit card program’s obvious flaws, Scott has 
strangely seized upon the rollout of the program in an attempt to score political points.
When teachers received their debit cards, they also received 
letters from JPMorgan Chase & Co., the bank supplying the cards. The letter read in part: “Governor Rick Scott is committed to improving Florida’s education system and recognizing their teachers for their hard work and dedication.”
Scott’s actual record on public education funding in Florida 
tells another story. This ineffectual debit card program is simply 
a distraction from the harmful cuts Scott has made to Florida’s 
public education system during his time in office.
During 2011, Scott’s first year in office, he cut $1.3 billion 
from Florida’s K-12 education budget. In fact, Scott wanted to cut even more, but his proposed cuts were too large for even the conservative Florida Legislature to swallow.
Although most of those spending cuts have been restored 
in the ensuing years, Florida still spends nearly $200 less per student than before the 2008 recession. Adjusted for inflation, 
Florida’s education spending in 2007-2008 was nearly $2 billion 
more  than Scott’s proposed $18.8 billion in funding for 2014.
Throughout his time in office, Scott has failed to demonstrate 
any sort of consistent dedication to building a strong public edu-cation system in Florida. If Scott is truly interested in improving Florida’s education system, he should withdraw his support for expensive, unreliable charter schools and focus on improving Florida’s underfunded, overcrowded public schools.
Voters should not be fooled by Scott’s feeble attempt to cover 
up his misguided education policies. This debit card program is nothing but a distraction from his massive spending cuts and his failure to promote a stronger public education system in Florida.The Mysterious Case of Charlie Crist
This week, all across the state of Florida, absentee ballots are being distributed, signaling the beginning of vot-ing for the 2014 elections. Obviously, the most closely 
watched race is the one for Florida governor between Repub-lican incumbent Rick Scott and the Democratic challenger, 
former Gov. Charlie Crist.
Over the course of the campaign, Scott and Crist have 
sought to exploit the other’s political record in order to gain 
the upper hand.
This campaign is particularly interesting because of Crist’s 
past political life as a Republican.
When Crist announced a few years ago that he was leav-
ing the Republican Party to become first an Independent and then a Democrat, liberals couldn’t contain their enthusiasm. 
Frankly, I still don’t understand why.
Crist was our self-proclaimed “Ronald Reagan Republi-
can” governor here in Florida not too long ago, and it seems 
as if Democrats have completely forgotten about that. Have they forgotten that, as recently as 2008, Crist supported a ban on same-sex marriage? Crist voted in favor of the Florida Marriage Protection Amendment and said, “It’s what I be-lieve in.”
Have Democrats also forgotten the fact that in 2010, Crist 
expressed his vehement support for pro-life policies? During his 2010 campaign for U.S. Senate, Crist promised to “fight for pro-life legislative efforts.”
Crist doesn’t even really support President Barack 
Obama’s supposed landmark achievement, the Affordable Care Act, also popularly known as Obamacare. In Crist’s book, published earlier this year, he wrote that he “didn’t love the president’s health-care plan” and thought that it was “too big, too complicated, and too bureaucratic.” Appar-
ently, now that Crist is running for office as a Democrat, he’s 
perfectly OK with Obamacare. The list of Crist’s flip-flops goes on and on. 
Crist’s political transformation isn’t necessarily surpris-
ing: Many politicians change their views during their careers, whether for political expediency or because of a genuine change of heart. Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, was frequently criticized for flip-flopping on several issues. 
However, the political changes 
of Romney and Crist are not com-parable. 
Romney changed his views on 
certain issues over a great deal of time, sometimes as many as 10 years. Crist’s views have changed repeatedly in just the last three or four years. The reason is simple: Crist is the ulti-mate career politician. 
There is a big difference between changing one’s political 
views over time after thoughtful consideration and simply changing one’s view for political benefit.
That is why Crist has gone from being a Republican to an 
Independent to a Democrat within the last four years: Crist 
doesn’t care what party he’s a member of, as long as he gets 
to remain in power.
Crist’s political gamesmanship makes it difficult to take 
any of his stances seriously. When he says now that he’s “sorry” for his vote in favor of Amendment 2 in 2008, or that he regrets his pro-life stances and is now strongly pro-choice, how can we believe him?
Crist is nothing more than a political chameleon, chang-
ing his opinions and policy proposals depending on which 
way the political wind blows.
Crist will say and do whatever it takes to be Florida’s gov-
ernor again, regardless of his previously stated principles or 
convictions. Do Florida voters really want to elect a governor who cares more about having a desk in Tallahassee than ac-tually helping Floridians?
Crist’s candidacy also says a lot about the current state of 
the Democratic Party. When the best candidate Democrats could recruit to challenge Scott was a Republican only four 
years ago, it shows that they are completely desperate and 
have no other viable options.
Settling for Crist will cost the Democrats dearly on Nov. 
4. Until then, hopefully they are happy with knowing they nominated a man who doesn’t stand with their party — be-cause he doesn’t stand for anyone but himself.

Swamp Party candidate presents 
ideas
Hello, Gators!
My name is Rachael Laky, and I am be-
yond excited to be a candidate for Hume 
Hall with Swamp Party.  
I would love to take the opportunity to 
share some of my background and reasons 
for pursuing this process. 
It is my genuine hope that, by reading this letter, you better understand what it is that makes me so passionate about Stu-dent Government and representing the 
students of UF.
My passion for working with and for 
others is what sparked my interest in slat-
ing for Senate.  
From the ﬁ  rst day I moved into Hume, 
I knew that the students I was surrounded by were a special and intelligent group of young adults. 
Their thoughts and concerns need to be 
addressed in SG in order to make our cam-
pus the best it can be.
I support every aspect of Swamp’s plat-
form, as well as the ideas for Hume.
 My top priorities are building a cross-
walk for Hume West and implementing free printing in the Hume area. 
I also want to work on creating more of a community atmosphere in the Hume 
area, and I plan to collaborate with the Student Honors Organization to accom-
plish this task. 
I am excited to get to know as many stu-
dents as possible in the coming weeks and 
to share my excitement for having the op-portunity to make a difference at UF.
Thank you, and go Gators!
Rachael Laky, UF accounting majorLetter to the Editor
In “Brave New World,” Aldous Huxley’s iconic 
dystopian novel, the oppressive power structure uses sensationalist media to distract members of 
the ﬁ  ctional society from more pressing social is-sues.
Today, the American media is using these same 
tactics of distraction and distortion.
If you haven’t heard yet, President Barack Obama 
has fallen victim to yet another absurd media attack. Recently, while exiting the Marine One chopper, the president offered a right-hand salute to two Marines.
Critics, particularly those on Fox News, are outraged because 
Obama happened to have a cup of what they speculated to be chai tea in his right hand when he gave the salute.
Retired Lt. Col. Michael Cermele called Obama a “jerk” for 
his perceived indifference during what is now being called the “latte salute.” 
Fox News’ Elisabeth Hasselbeck tried to address what some 
would call an unintentional act of disrespect on Obama’s end, saying, “When you’re not intending to do something, you could be intending to do something.”
Hasselbeck’s nonsensical statement seeks to criminalize 
the president for an action that he probably hardly gave any 
thought to at all.
The pundits at Fox News and other conservative media out-
lets are expressing outrage over this ridiculous, trivial non-is-
sue. 
They are essentially asking: How could the U.S. president be 
so careless as to not think about switching his cup from his right hand to his left before saluting?
Here’s an answer for them: Because there are many, many 
more important things for the U.S. president to be thinking 
about.
The 2014 U.N. Climate Summit is fast approaching. At this 
conference, world leaders will discuss the current and future 
effects of climate change on our world and society and what political leaders can do to counteract them.
The U.S. is also dealing with recent rumors of ISIS planning to 
attack New York City’s subway system and ﬂ  y its ﬂ  ag over the White House to symbolize its siege on America. 
American society is dealing with a series of com-
plex and serious social issues. 
There is still racially charged social unrest in Fer-
guson, Missouri, after the death of Michael Brown. 
Gender inequality, which was addressed by U.N. 
Women Goodwill Ambassador Emma Watson in a recent speech promoting the HeForShe campaign, is another serious issue political leaders are grap-pling with.
The president may have been thinking about any one of these 
things when he gave the so-called “latte salute.” 
Any of it would have been signiﬁ  cantly more important than 
switching his coffee cup to the other hand to salute the Marines 
greeting his helicopter.
I would challenge anyone who sees the “latte salute” as a 
symbol of Obama’s disrespect to our troops to take a step back 
and look at the big picture.
If we are seeking to be socially aware and educated citizens 
of the U.S. and the world, we must do a better job of ﬁ  ltering the content our mass media outlets present to us. 
The media should not be allowed to write the narrative and 
choose the lens through which we view the world.
Conservative commentators have viliﬁ  ed Obama for his “latte 
salute,” even though George W. Bush would often awkwardly salute the troops while holding his pet schnauzer, Barney.
For the record, I don’t think Bush deserved to be criticized for 
his own “doggie salute.” It simply just isn’t that important.
If we allow the media to convince us that these trivial contro-
versies are the most important issues facing America today, we risk falling into the same dystopian state as the society depicted in “Brave New World.” 
There are so many issues and threats American voters and 
political leaders must confront in the coming years.
The “latte salute” controversy does nothing but place unnec-
essary focus on an issue that distracts from the real problems we face.

Recently, actress and millennial 
sweetheart Emma Watson gave 
a speech in front of the U.N. 
about the importance of male involve-
ment in the women’s rights movement. 
While I am a fan of Watson and the idea 
of male-inclusive feminism, I’m not 
interested in making an impassioned 
plea for male support. The concept of gender equality is so simple. I don’t feel 
the need to coax anyone — male or fe-
male — into supporting such a cause, 
nor do I want to explain to them why it 
does not yet exist. I’m not going to drag out the statistics on wage inequality, 
launch into an overview of rape culture 
or explain why the concept of “legiti-
mate rape” is bogus.
If you don’t 
support the idea 
of a women’s 
rights move-
ment because 
it’s too “emasculating” or you believe it “discriminates against men,” I can’t help you. It is not that I am opposed 
to any sort of criticism of the women’s 
rights movement. In fact, I would agree 
that feminism is insufﬁ  cient in address-ing a multitude of issues. For decades, the movement has systematically ex-
cluded African-American, Latino, 
Asian-American, Arab-American and 
other non-white women. While I ap-preciate her support, the recent media attention on Emma Watson’s speech follows a long tradition of upper-class white women being uplifted as the face of feminism. The feminist movement has also forsaken gender non-conform-ing, LGBTQ-identiﬁ  ed women who are essential to the discussion of gender equality.
Feminism has failed us in so many 
ways, and I welcome change in the women’s rights movement. However, it has never failed to reach out to men or attempt to win their favor. I can’t count the number of conversations I’ve heard in just the past year about feminism consisting of mostly women attempting to explain its importance to mostly belligerent men. Although we’d appreciate it, feminists don’t need the support of males. I’m “WeForShe,” and if anyone — male, female or some-where along the spectrum — wants to join, they are more than welcome.

Julian Andrew sipped on vodka-
soaked raspberries, tonic and a splash of 
grapefruit with a lime.
“It’s amazing. You should try it,” he 
said before he took another sip of his drink served in a mason jar.
 He and dozens of others escaped 
the rain inside the High Dive, an indoor and outdoor bar that hosted the Original Gainesville Food Truck Rally on Satur-day night.
Andrew, 23, found out about the rally 
from a friend who had gone last year. The UF telecommunication senior said he felt like it was something fun and different than the Midtown scene.
“I had three totally different things, 
and it is so awesome that they have so much,” Andrew said of the variety of foods available, his favorite being the Pelican Brothers’ chicken-and-wafﬂ  e slider. “It’s been really good.”
The frequent food truck rally featured 
eight trucks and two non-alcoholic drink 
tents in the High Dive parking lot from 5 
to 11 p.m. Saturday. Prices ranged from 
about $6 to $15.
One of the rally’s more popular ven-
dors was Humble Pie. The pizza com-
pany’s setup didn’t consist of a regular 
truck, but instead, a trailer with a round, 
clay-oven top and a ﬁ  restone brick oven. Employees texted patrons when pizzas were ready to combat long lines.
“We do catering, and we are at the 
Farmers market downtown every week,” 
said Louis Jarvis, as he assembled a pizza 
topped with apple and blue cheese on it. Humble Pie sold out at about 9 p.m.
Inside the bar, a handful of bands 
and musicians played short sets while 
people gathered with family and friends 
for cocktails, moonshine, Jell-O shots and food.
Despite the rain, the downtown staple 
attracted new patrons, like Absinthe Wu.

alone at the bar, eating a Monsta Lobsta lobster roll.
“I rode my bike here,” Wu, 21, said,

Crowds of spectators crowded 
around tables of competitors play-
ing video games like “Mario Kart 8” and “League of Legends” as the music from Dance Dance Revolu-tion filled the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom.
Gamers and onlookers from 
around the state gathered in the ballroom Saturday to watch and compete in the first GatorLAN of the school year.
GatorLAN is the largest free competitive video gaming event in Florida and is hosted by Gator 
Gaming, a UF student organiza-
tion, three times a year.
President of Gator Gaming Ed-
uardo Fonseca, 22, said about 600 
people registered to take part in the 13-hour public event.
“Gaming just brings people to-
gether from all sorts of different 
backgrounds and personalities,” 
the UF digital arts and sciences senior said. “All sorts of people — very talented people — come out 
here, and it’s just fun to see every-one come together just for this one 
experience.”
Applicants register online to 
compete in games provided by 
sponsors, such as Study Edge and 
Trendy Entertainment.
Gamers are required to bring 
their own controller, console and computer to the event. This year, “Super Smash Bros. Melee” and “League of Legends” were two of 
the most popular games.
Josse Calzado, a UF psychology 
senior, attended GatorLAN on Sat-urday for his fourth time. The first 
time he heard about it was from a flier for a free video gaming event, he said. But the competition keeps 
him coming back.
“I like playing against other 
people, getting their insight, things 
like that, you know,” said Calzado, 21. “I’m a competitive person by 
nature. I kind of thrive off of it.”Gamers were not the only 
attendees intensely staring at 
screens. About 2,000 onlookers 
came to watch the game competi-tions throughout the day, Fonseca 
said.
Spectators were also able to 
watch through a  live-stream.
“You see people you never ever 
see in any other scenario,” he said. “Not everyone likes sports, not ev-
eryone likes dancing, but for some reason, gaming can be the great equalizer where even just watch-
ing it is fun, too.”

Volunteer opportunities are a click away 
with the help of the UF Center for Leader-
ship and Service’s new website. 
The center, which partnered with the 
United Way of North Central Florida, has launched an online program called Volun-teer Select that allows students to search for volunteer opportunities by category and agency. 
The service then connects students with a 
volunteer coordinator to get them started.
“We wanted students to come and find 
volunteer opportunities in one place,” said Angela Garcia, the Community Engagement & Service-Learning director at CLS. “Stu-dents can use it as a search tool and ‘favor-ite’ organizations.”
The center developed the site to promote service in the Gainesville community.  
Local nonprofits looking for volunteers 
can register their organizations on the web-site. 
More than 45 Gainesville organizations 
have already registered with the service. 
Gainesville organizations rely on UF 
volunteers in order to complete their pro-grams.
Phillis Sain, the administrative assistant 
at the Gainesville Salvation Army, said the Salvation Army would not run effectively if it weren’t for its volunteers.
“We really need volunteers for our com-munity feedings, our homework help pro-gram and operating our thrift store,” Sain said. “Most of our volunteers are UF stu-dents.”
Volunteering not only helps the commu-
nity. It gives students like Allyssa Maxon, who volunteers at a UF marine laboratory, the opportunity to shape their future ca-reers.
Maxon, a 21-year-old UF marine sciences 
senior, said volunteering is something that not only gave her professional experience but also gave her connections in her field of study.

OKLAHOMA CITY — A 
man who was shot after au-
thorities said he beheaded one woman and attacked another at an Oklahoma food process-
ing plant from which he had 
just been fired has regained consciousness and was inter-viewed by detectives Saturday.
Alton Nolen, 30, remains 
hospitalized in stable condi-tion after Thursday’s attack at the Vaughan Foods plant in the Oklahoma City suburb 
of Moore, Police Sgt. Jeremy 
Lewis said. He said Nolen will be charged Monday with first-degree murder and assault and battery with a deadly weapon, and he may also face federal charges.
Lewis said Nolen was fired right before the attack, and he then drove from the building that houses the company’s hu-man resources department to its main distribution center.
Once inside, he attacked 54-
year-old Colleen Hufford with a knife in the center’s adminis-trative office area, eventually severing her head, according to police. 
Nolen then repeatedly 
stabbed 43-year-old Traci John-son before Mark Vaughan, a

TOKYO  — Finally reaching the ash-covered summit of a 
still-erupting volcano in central Japan, rescue workers made a 
grim discovery Sunday: 31 apparently dead people, some re-portedly buried in knee-deep ash.
Four victims were brought down and confirmed dead one 
day after Mount Ontake’s big initial eruption, said Takehiko 
Furukoshi, a Nagano prefecture crisis-management official. The 27 others were listed as having heart and lung failure, the 
customary way for Japanese authorities to describe a body un-til police doctors can examine it.
Officials provided no details on how they may have died.It was the first fatal eruption in modern times at 3,067-meter 
Mount Ontake, a popular climbing destination about 210 kilo-meters west of Tokyo on the main Japanese island of Honshu. A similar eruption occurred in 1979, but no one died.
Rescue helicopters hovered over ash-covered mountain lodges and vast landscapes that looked a ghostly gray, like the surface of the moon, devoid of nearly all color but the bright orange of rescue workers’ jumpsuits.
Mount Ontake erupted shortly before noon at perhaps the 
worst possible time, with at least 250 people taking advantage of a beautiful fall Saturday to go for a hike. 
The blast spewed large white plumes of gas and ash high 
into the sky, blotted out the midday sun and blanketed the sur-rounding area in ash.At least 31 believed dead at Japanese volcano eruption siteMONDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 2014

After Florida swept Auburn on 
Friday in its first Southeastern Con-
ference game of the season, UF was 
able to do it again on Sunday against 
Ole Miss.
Florida (8-3, 2-0 SEC) closed out 
the weekend on a solid note with a 
3-0 win over Ole Miss (14-2, 0-2 SEC) 
in the O’Connell Center.
Florida is 43-3 all-time against Ole 
Miss. But under Wise’s direction, the Gators are 37-0 against the Rebels.
Before Friday night’s match against 
Auburn, coach Mary Wise said Flori-da was looking at conference play as a clean slate, a separate season from 
Florida’s nonconference schedule.
So far, the mentality is working.
“In terms of early on it was difficult 
finding kills, and credit our defense,” Wise said. “Later in the match, (Ole 
Miss) made some adjustments, we 
didn’t adjust as quickly as we would have liked to, but that’s part of vol-leyball. Team makes an adjustment, 
you adjust back. So we’ll look at it as 
we look at every match and say, ‘Are 
we better from the match going for-
ward?’”
Florida’s performance against Ole 
Miss was one of the most consistent 
matches the Gators have played this 
season.
Freshman middle blocker Rhamat 
Alhassan and sophomore outside hit-ter Alex Holston both saw strong per-
formances.
Alhassan finished the day with six 
kills on 13 attempts, one service ace 
and two block assists, while Holston 
had 12 kills on 22 attempts and four 
digs.
“Everybody’s kind of embraced

Home is where the heart is, and it’s also where 
the victory was Sunday for the Gators.
No. 7 Florida (8-2, 3-0 Southeastern Confer-
ence) defeated Missouri (7-2-2, 2-1 SEC) 3-1 at 
Donald R. Dizney Stadium, completing a sweep 
of this weekend’s SEC home stand — the only 
such weekend on the schedule.
The Gators started the 
game ready to play, control-ling the possession early in the first half and keeping the 
ball in Missouri’s third of the field.
Midfielder Havana Solaun broke the scoreless 
game open, putting the ball in the back of the net 
in the 19th minute to give the Gators a 1-0 lead.
Florida continued to apply pressure, passing 
the ball around while keeping Missouri from 
pushing players forward.
The Gators managed to take a two-goal lead 
from an unusual goal by substitute Betsy Mid-dleton in the 33rd minute.
Middleton received a pass from Pamela Begic 
on the left side of the penalty box but whiffed on 
her initial attempt as the Tigers’ goalkeeper came 
sliding in to stop the ball. 
Both players lost sight of the ball, but Middle-
ton found it first and managed to shoot accurate-ly before the goalkeeper could recover.
“It was very strange,” Middleton said. “Hon-
estly for a second there I had no idea what was going on. … Savannah was continuing into the box and she was making a fantastic run, and 
since the goalkeeper was cutting off my near-
post angle, I was thinking ‘I’ll cut it back to Sa-vannah and she can lay it right into the goal,’ and as I was doing that the keeper did cut me off, and I turn around and all of a sudden the ball’s just free in the middle of the goal.”
Although the Gators commanded the first half 
of play, Missouri started the second half with Florida tops

The first meet of the season for the Flor-
ida women’s swimming and diving team 
went exactly how they wanted it to go. 
Coach Gregg Troy may not agree, but 
a win is a win and that is what it is all about. Florida (1-0, 1-0 Southeastern Confer-
ence) defeated SEC opponent Arkansas (0-1, SEC 0-1) fairly easily after taking 12 of 
16 events en route to a 189.5-110.5 victory 
on Saturday at the O’Connell Center. 
The win increased the Gators all-time 
record in season openers to 42-2 with a 14-1 
record in SEC debuts. 
Junior Natalie Hinds led the Gators, claiming three individual wins along with 
contributing to the 200-yard medley relay team victory (1:40.22). 
Hinds won the 50-yard freestyle (22.49 
seconds), 100-yard freestyle (49.08) and 100-yard butterfly (54.75) on Saturday. As a holder of two individual team re-
cords, Hinds showed the type of leader she is and what kind of leader she can be for 
this swim team. 
But for Troy, he will continue to look to 
others for more leadership.
“Obviously Natalie Hinds is a quality 
athlete. She gets up and races well,” Troy said. “But we’re going to have to have a 
few more go-to people.”

Jordan McPherson / Alligator Staffthe depth of this team,” se-
nior libero Holly Pole. “I feel like everybody is ready to 
go in whenever their name 
is called on, realizing it can be at anytime. Just trying to make the most of your op-
portunity when you’re on the 
court, regardless of whether we’re up, we’re down, what-ever the score is just trying to get better every day.”
But it was the leadership 
of junior middle blocker Si-mone Antwi that helped Florida sweep Ole Miss.
The Fairfax Station, Va., 
native had a career day with 11 kills on 13 attempts, giv-ing her a .769 hitting percent-age — topping her previous 
career-best mark of .706 set 
against Stanford on Sept. 7, 2013 — and one block assist.
Antwi was noticeably ab-
sent from Florida’s lineup just one week earlier in its 3-2 loss to Marquette on Sept. 19.
Wise said an undisclosed 
injury kept Antwi from com-peting, but Wise was hap-py to see that Antwi’s two weeks out of the game hadn’t 
affected her play.
“Last week  I had a lot of time off because I couldn’t 
play, so there was a lot of mental just sitting in practice and watching things,” Antwi said. “When I got back it was 
kind of just getting back into 
the rhythm of thing so that was fine.”
Against Auburn, Antwi 
had five kills on 15 attempts, finishing the night with a .333 hitting clip in addition to three total blocks. Antwi’s progression from Friday to 
Sunday after sitting out with 
an injury before SEC play is positive for Florida’s middle blockers, which was forced 
to rotate more players in at-
tempt to replace Antwi’s presence.
“Simone, now in her 
fourth year in the program, 
we ask a lot of her,” Wise 
said. “(She is) by far the most experienced of the middles. It’s not just the numbers, but 
the presence she give us and 
making good decisions on the court. 
“She really stabilizes us, 
she is the captain of the line 
defense, is the best way to 
describe her role. When we don’t have her we really miss that, as much physically, but 
really in a lot of ways just in 
terms of scheming and her presence on the court.”Warner who led the Gators div-
ing squad with two first place fin-
ishes in the 1-meter and 3-meter diving event. 
Warner finished the 1-meter 
dive with a meet-best 290.55, more than 25 points better than second-place finisher and teammate Dela-nie Dye. She won the 3-meter dive by more than 55 points.
It was the debut for coach Dale 
Schultz, who came over to Florida from Arkansas, so it was an awk-ward first meet for the coach to 
say the least. 
“It was tough because I kept 
watching the Arkansas divers in 
the water during the warmups and thinking, ‘oh I missed their 
dive’, but it was good,” Schultz 
said. 
“It’s good to get the first one 
out of the way with the transition that has happened.”
Schultz takes over for Donnie 
Craine, who died in a boating ac-cident in April. 
It was an overall positive first 
step for the women’s squad to get 
a good win against a conference 
opponent heading into the Pinch A Penny All Florida Invitational, which begins on Friday and con-cludes Sunday at the O’Connell 
Center. 
The women will be joined 
by the men’s team as they will 
make their season debut in the 
Invitational as both squads go for 
their fifth consecutive title at this event.more determination than Flori-
da.
Just two minutes into the half, 
Missouri scored a 35-yard goal from the foot of Alli Magaletta, giving the Tigers even more con-fidence. 
Missouri took four shots to 
Florida’s one during the first 10 minutes of the half.
Florida was under intense 
pressure from the Tigers until 
Savannah Jordan took control of 
the situation, scoring her seventh goal of the season in the 57th min-ute to give the Gators a 3-1 lead, and more importantly, breathing room.
From that point on, the Gators 
took seven more shots, while the Tigers only managed to get off 
one, giving Florida complete con-
trol for the rest of the game.
Coach Becky Burleigh said 
the team didn’t play as well as it could have, but ultimately the players got the job done.
“In the end, that’s what we 
were looking for coming out of this weekend, was the six points, and that’s what we got, so we’re happy about that,” she said. 
“I think we’re just gonna 
continue to grow and grow and grow.”
Depth played a major role in 
the Gators’ victory. Florida played 22 players in Sunday’s game, ver-sus 17 for Missouri, and during a hot afternoon in Gainesville, keeping players fresh was one of the reasons Florida was able to dominate the final half hour of the game.
“It’s great during the games 
when we have an opportunity to show our depth, because we re-ally have so many people on the bench that can get in and make a huge impact,” said Middleton, who came off the bench to pro-vide 45 quality minutes for the Gators.
Missouri’s depth was hurt by 
an illness to midfielder Kaysie Clark, who did not play in the game. 
Burleigh described Clark as 
the Tigers’ best player, and said she was disappointed the Gators weren’t able to compete against her.

One of four Gators made it to the 
qualifying rounds in the Riviera/ITA 
Women’s All-American Champion-ships pre-qualifying tournaments held in Los Angeles. 
Freshman Josie Kuhlman won 
against Neda Koprcina from Texas (4-6, 6-0, 6-0) in the first round on Satur-day. Later that day, Kuhlman won her second-round match against Virginia’s Marie Faure in straight sets (6-3, 6-4). 
Kuhlman is a contender for the qual-
ifying round after winning in the third round against Kate Vialle of North Car-
olina (4-2, ret.) on Sunday.
If Kuhlman wins all three of her 
qualifying-round matches — which 
will be held Tuesday and Wednes-day — she will play in the main draw, which will be held Thursday through Sunday.
Freshman Peggy Porter lost in the 
first round in her first ITA tournament 
to Lucia Butkovska from the Univer-sity of Portland (6-3, 6-2). Sophomore 
Spencer Liang opened her play by los-ing to Anna Mamalat from Texas A&M 
(6-1, 6-4) in the first round. Sophomore Belinda Woolcock 
also lost her first-
round match to Gabrielle Smith from 
Southern California (6-1, 6-4). 
Kuhlman and Porter defeated Maia 
Magill and Kristin Wiley at UCLA (8-2) Saturday morning and won again Sun-day morning against Lana Groenvyeck and Pippa Horn from Texas (8-3). The pair will play in qualifying rounds.
Freshman Brooke Austin and soph-
omore Kourtney Keegan both earned spots in the singles qualifying draw, while junior Brianna Morgan received an automatic entry into the singles main draw Thursday through Sunday. While Austin and Morgan have been selected to the qualifying doubles list, Keegan and Woolcock received an automatic 
entry into the doubles main draw.

After a victory over Atlantic Coast Confer-
ence rival Clemson last week, Florida State 
traveled to Raleigh, N.C., to take on N.C. State. FSU’s track record in Raleigh heading into Sat-urday was poor, with their last victory on the 
road against the Wolfpack coming in 2008. 
After trailing 24-7 in the first quarter, FSU’s 
offense found life and scored two unanswered 
touchdowns to trail by just three at half.
After FSU quarterback Jameis Winston 
threw an interception on first down on its first drive in the second half, N.C. State quarterback Jacoby Brissett orchestrated a six-play, 59-yard scoring drive to give N.C. State a 10-point lead.
The Seminoles began to pull away late in the 
third, with back-to-back Winston touchdown passes to go up by four with 3:24 left in the third. FSU drove down the field for a one-yard Karlos Williams touchdown to cap the contest. Florida State extended its nation’s longest active win-ning streak to a program-record 20 games.
SEC West Thriller: Unranked Arkansas 
went into Arlington, Texas, to take on No. 6 Texas A&M and gashed the Aggies’ defense, scoring three rushing touchdowns for 110 yards in the first half. 
Arkansas quarterback Brandon Allen threw a 44-yard touchdown with just over five min-utes to go in the third quarter to put the Razor-backs up 28-14. 
But the fourth quarter 
was the Kenny Hill show. Early in the quarter, Hill 
found Edward Pope for an 
86-yard touchdown bomb, and came through with 2:29 to go in the fourth throwing a 59-yard fade to Josh Reyn-olds to tie things up and 
force overtime.
The Aggies found paydirt on their first 
overtime possession with Hill hitting Malcome 
Kennedy for a 25-yard touchdown to seal it.
SEC Least: Meanwhile in the Southeastern 
Conference Eastern Division, Missouri — who 
lost to Indiana at home last week — went into Columbia, S.C. and knocked off No. 13 South Carolina.
The Tigers took the lead for good on a one-
yard touchdown run to go up 21-20 with 1:36 left in the fourth. Missouri was able to hang on 
and stun the Gamecocks on their home field.
Tennessee traveled to Athens and battled all 
game with No. 12 Georgia, but Todd Gurley’s 
208-yard rushing performance prevailed, and the Dawgs won by three.FSU wins another close one
