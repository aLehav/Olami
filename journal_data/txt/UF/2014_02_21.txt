UF students are using Facebook to broad-
cast the many Gator faces that support Ven-
ezuelan student protesters.
Raquel Larrañaga, a 22-year-old UF archi-
tecture senior, compiled hundreds of photos of students holding up posters with their name, country and two campaign hashtags: #ImYo-urVoiceVenezuela and #PrayForVenezuela. 
About ﬁ  ve student protesters have been 
killed as of Thursday in anti-government pro-tests in cities across Venezuela. Many more have been injured or jailed.
Larrañaga said she feels a huge responsibil-ity to promote the cause in the U.S.
“We’re not there to ﬁ  ght for our country 
and go to the streets and show our support,” she said. “So we have to show support in an-other way. We have to spread the word.”
She said she promotes the cause via social-
media sharing. Social media is especially im-portant in light of Venezuela’s limited access to media. Many media channels have been censored in Venezuela, and even Twitter has been restricted. 
 “If they don’t have access to it, we will pro-
vide the world with information,” she said.

Engineers’ Week is in full 
swing, and organizers hope 
to engage students from all 
majors. 
The  series of events is de-
signed to raise awareness for 
the analytically minded. This 
year it will include an elec-
tronic music concert.
It’s a way nonengineering 
students can broaden their scope, said 22-year-old Kate-
lyn Lubke, a UF biomedical 
engineering senior.
“It’s cool to show what 
we’re interested in and how 
we can relate it back to the 
majority of what the world is going through,” Lubke said. “I want people to understand we are social. We can talk.”
E-Week ﬁ  rst started at UF 
in 1951 and  has been held an-nually since. This year it will include 15 events that Samuel 
Nason, executive director 
of Engineers’ Week, said he hopes will bring out a more diverse crowd of students.
“We want to see nonengi-
neers at events this year and bring up the awareness of what engineering has accom-plished,” said the 19-year-old UF electrical engineering sophomore.
Organizers are hoping that 
students, no matter their ma-jor, will unite at E-Week’s big-gest event — E-Fest.
Anderson, a 22-year-old 
UF electrical engineering se-nior, said E-Fest is a fun way to bring the engineering com-munity and the nonengineer-
ing community together.
“In your niche of engineer-
ing you don’t get to get out 
much,” Anderson said. “With 
a festival like this, it’s not just 
going to be engineers. We’re marketing to anybody, every-
body.”
The music festival will fea-
ture live music from six bands, 
free carnival food and activi-ties such as rock climbing and 
carnival games from 5 to 11 
p.m. on Saturday at the North Lawn by the Reitz Union.
The Audio Engineering 
Society is partnering up with 
Swamp Records and the Ben-
ton Engineering Council to host this event, which won 
the Best Society Social Event 
of 2013, said Jared Anderson, director of performances for  Engineers’ Week to 
showcase social side of the industrySEE VENEZUELA, PAGE 4

Gainesville Police arrested a 
72-year-old San Francisco man 
Wednesday after discovering he was carrying duffel bags ﬁ  lled with 53 pounds of marijuana. 
Ofﬁ  cers arrested Donald Forrest 
Morrison on charges of trafﬁ  cking more than 25 pounds of marijuana and possession of drug parapherna-lia, according to an arrest report.
At about 5:40 p.m., an ofﬁ  cer 
working with Gainesville-Alachua County Drug Task Force pulled over a silver Hon-
da driving south-bound on South Road 93 for fol-lowing too close-
ly at mile marker 
375, according to the report.
M o r r i s o n 
seemed nervous 
and was shaking, according to the report. Police asked him if he had anything illegal in his car, and he said he didn’t.
When a corporal arrived on the scene, he walked a police dog around Morrison’s car. The dog alerted police that drugs were inside the car, according to the report. 
A search of the vehicle uncov-
ered 4 ounces of weed and rolling papers in the driver’s seat, according to the report. Police then found three duffel bags ﬁ  lled with the roughly $250,000 worth of marijuana.
Ofﬁ  cers booked Morrison into 
the Alachua County Jail at about 8 p.m. He was released at about 4:20 p.m. Thursday after meeting a 
$52,500 bond.

Isaac Jones lives in the echoes 
of Pleasant Street’s heyday.
Jones, 68, was born and 
raised in the 20-block district 
long enough to see the ﬂ  ourish and fall of the black community based there. 
Gainesville’s Matheson 
Museum opened an exhibition called “Life on Pleasant Street” to showcase the neighbor-hood’s roughly 150-year his-
tory in honor of Black History 
Month. It will be open through May at the museum, located at 513 E. University Ave.
Freed slaves from South 
Carolina founded the neighbor-hood, which was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. It later became 
a local center for civil rights ad-
vocacy. 
Jones, an owner of the White 
& Jones building and 2 Friends Coffee Shop, located at 1001 NW Fifth Ave., said he was 
not old enough to take part in 
activism efforts but will never forget the hardships of the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, 
an era the museum’s exhibition 
will highlight.
Oral histories play in the 
background on the exhibition ﬂ  oor, some including Wil-
helmina Williams Johnson, a 
former music instructor at Lin-coln High School, and former Lincoln High School  principal 
A. Quinn Jones, who is cred-
ited with bringing education to Pleasant Street.
The exhibition illustrates the 
community’s progression from 
its foundation of Christian faith 
to its development into a hub for education and activism. The exhibit also includes the belongings of A. Quinn Jones. 
Bus tours through the Pleasant 
Street district will begin Satur-day, and tickets cost $30.
Megan Covey, a Matheson 
Museum technician, said the exhibition is a great way to learn more about the community. 
“Sometimes, you don’t natu-
rally have contact with all of the 
diversity cities like Gainesville 
have to offer,” Covey said. “This is just a great way to learn more about the place we all live 
and the history we share.”
Stephanie Pastore, also a 
museum technician, said the 
exhibit’s purpose is to foster curiosity and educate visitors 
about the neighborhood.
“I think that part of this ex-
hibition is to highlight the parts 
of history that, for so many gen-
erations, historians looked the 
other way, and the community looked the other way,” Pastore said. “I think that’s a way of building a bridge between the 
Pleasant Street community and 
Gainesville.”
For people who’ve seen the 
community’s change, the ex-
hibition is a way to recognize 
what once was. 
While residents rent houses 
along streets where rich his-tory still clings like the Spanish 
moss in the overhanging trees, 
Jones recalled how the area has changed over time despite ef-forts to maintain its history.
“I hope we can develop 
some tours to show young peo-ple what used to exist,” Jones said.Pleasant Street

A team led by two UF research-
ers was recently awarded thou-
sands of dollars to help win the game of hide-and-seek with leuke-mia cells.  
The Leukemia and Lymphoma 
Society awarded the team a two-year, $800,000 grant to ﬁ  nd the spots leukemia cells tend to hide in the body and to develop drugs that cripple these cells.
Research leaders Dr. Christo-
pher Cogle and Edward Scott, both professors in UF’s College of Medi-cine, applied for the grant during the summer in hopes of furthering their research in the behaviors of blood cancer.  
Cogle deals with these cells each 
day at UF Health Shands Hospital. 
“Our aim is to ﬁ  nd out the hid-
ing spots of leukemia cells because that’s a major problem in the clin-ic,” he said.Cogle said another obstacle he 
faces in the clinic is that leukemia 
often returns after chemotherapy 
alone.
The team is conducting research 
on blood vessels, which they grow 
in sterile dishes. They are also us-ing mice as test subjects to further understand where the cancer cells hide and what types of drugs they can use to eradicate the cells.
“We’re able to test these ideas 
very rapidly so that we can save young children and other adults from these cancers,” Cogle said.
Scott, a professor in molecular 
genetics and microbiology said he and Cogle want to make sure what they discover in the mice will suc-cessfully translate into signiﬁ  cant change for human leukemia cases. 
Cogle and Scott will share their 
data with Celgene, the pharmaceu-tical company they partnered with, in the hopes of developing drug compounds that will block where 
cancer cells hide.
“The main goal is to understand 
a new biology of leukemia cells 
that has never been appreciated 
before and to ﬁ  nd drug units that 
could be therapeutic in the future 
for my patients,” Cogle said.
Chris Abeleda, a 20-year-old 
UF psychology sophomore, was 
diagnosed with leukemia in spring 
2013. His case of acute lympho-
blastic leukemia is in remission, 
but he cannot ofﬁ  cially be declared 
cancer-free for ﬁ  ve years. 
He said he thinks the research 
that Cogle and Scott are conduct-ing is great and wants to know if 
there are still leukemia cells hiding 
in his body.
“If they could ﬁ  nd a way to 
make sure it’s all gone,” Abeleda said, “that would be perfect.”Grant to fund UF leukemia research

But the name was changed due 
to the new location, which was 
chosen to be more central to cam-pus.
Anderson said the event re-
ceived five times the amount of funding because of the location change.
Nason said E-Week is a cel-
ebration of what engineering has accomplished.
E-Fest is an invitation for ev-
eryone to come and celebrate.

For the final season of his favorite show, 
a UF student is counting on Twitter to reach 
producers and bring attention to his cause.
David Nassau, a 19-year-old UF market-
ing sophomore, is using the Twitter hashtag 
#HIMYMcharity to catch the eye of “How I Met Your Mother” executives for his non-
profit Hopping 4 A Cure.
Nassau started the organization in 2010 
on International Suit Up Day, a fictional day based on the popular sitcom.
In high school, Nassau said he and a 
friend joked they were dressed up in suits for their hopscotch team. The joke became real-ity when Nassau formed a charity hopscotch event to raise money for multiple sclerosis.
After Nassau’s father was diagnosed with 
multiple sclerosis, Nassau said he wanted to do something to help.
“The more exposure there is for multiple 
sclerosis, the more positive things will come from it,” he said.
Hopping 4 A Cure held its first Twitter 
promotion night last Thursday and will host more leading up to the “How I Met Your Mother” season finale. 
Nick Stockhammer, a 20-year-old UF fi-
nance sophomore, said there has already been a lot of Twitter activity with the 
hashtag.
“We hope to maybe get people who only 
know ‘How I Met Your Mother’ to stumble 
upon Hopping 4 A Cure,” he said.UF student’s charity suits up on Twitter to raise awareness

Monday.
The NUTmobile, a 24-foot-
long peanut on wheels, will be on campus from Monday 
to Wednesday to recruit stu-
dents for the next “peanutters” crew. The team will operate the 
NUTmobile as it travels across 
the country during a yearlong journey, hosting promotional events for Planters along the way.
Lauren Enkerud, a UF 
alumna and Gainesville native, said the three current peanut-ters will be handing out fliers, popping into classrooms and driving around Gainesville. 
She said the team is looking for 
public relations and marketing majors, but any student nutty enough to take the job is wel-come. 
An informational session 
will be held at the Career Re-source Center classroom from 5:30 to 6:30 p.m. on Wednes-
day.
“Its just a really fun, nutty 
job,” she said. “(The NUTmo-

UF a cappella group No Southern Ac-
cent is climbing the scales of the competi-
tive a cappella world.
On Saturday, NSA placed first at Var-
sity Vocal’s International Championship of 
Collegiate a cappella south quarterfinals, 
held at the Curtis M. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. Receiving a total of 428 points, NSA is now the highest-scored a cappella team in the U.S in 2014.
C.J. Wittus, NSA president and a 22-year-
old UF sociology and criminology senior, said the group’s social media “blew up” af-ter its performance, so he had a pretty good idea about how the group scored.
“First place has always been an FSU 
group,” Wittus said. “This is the first time any UF a cappella group has placed first at ICCA.”
The group will compete in the ICCA semifinals on March 15 at Vanderbilt Uni-versity in Nashville. Although NSA will be the only team from UF, three Florida State University groups are scheduled to com-pete.  
“All of the groups have a chance to work 
to improve their set, so it’s anyone’s game,” said Lindsay Howerton-Hastings, producer for the ICCA south quarterfinals.
She said the competition would be tough 
among the ten teams attending semifinals, but she said NSA fits the description of a great a cappella group. 
“NSA has been growing in leadership 
and strong singers steadily over the past few years, and they killed it on Saturday,” she wrote in an email.
Alex Greene, NSA’s musical director, re-
ceived an award for most outstanding vocal percussion at the competition. The 22-year-old UF material science engineering senior 
said he stood out because his microphone-
holding technique creates harder beats.
At this point, he said, the group is pretty 
well-versed in its routine, so the majority of practices will be spent mastering its per-formances. 
“There’s work to be done, but I don’t 
think the pressure is as heavy,” Greene said.
Creator of viral video plans another
said social media is important as a low-cost way to promote ideas.
“If you can’t access a par-
ticular service that allows you 
to communicate with the world, 
then obviously that limits your opportunities,” he said.
Larrañaga said displaying the 
names of students’ countries on the posters represents a global support for the cause.“They know that there’s some-
one out there that knows what’s happening and that wants their 
liberty as much as they want it,” 
she said. 
Larrañaga met with other 
students Monday on Turlington Plaza to gather more pictures. They brought a sign that said “Ask me about Venezuela.”
Estefanía Lalinde, a 19-year-
old UF health science freshman 
from Venezuela, took photos of 
students on Turlington to sup-port “Venezuelan students who are out there fighting for their lives,” she said.
The photos that Larrañaga 
has compiled will most likely be 
shared beyond Facebook. 
Andreina Nash, a 21-year-old 
UF marketing and telecommuni-
cation junior, made the YouTube video “What’s going on in Ven-ezuela in a nutshell.” The video went viral and now has more than 2 million views.
Larrañaga said Nash wants to 
make another video and asked her for pictures.
“I wish I could be there,” she 
said. “This is the best I can do.” veNezUelA ,

She woke up before the sun even 
thought about rising. She split her po-
nytail in two and wrapped it into a bun, gelling it in place. She looked in the mir-
ror. It had to be perfect to meet the stan-
dard for a female Marine.
Now, Skye Barkley, a 25-year-old UF 
wildlife ecology and conservation stu-
dent, tames her hair with a palm full of 
mousse and leaves it down. She has tran-
sitioned into the civilian world.
To discuss the concerns of student 
veterans like Barkley, the UF Collegiate Veterans Society held a luncheon at Yon 
Hall with UF Board of Trustees’ mem-
bers at noon Thursday. Among those in 
attendance were Lt. Col. Jason Rosen-berg of the Air Force Reserve, and Vice President of Student Affairs and retired 
Army Gen. Dave Kratzer.
The group discussed communication 
between advisers and the Ofﬁ  ce of Vet-
erans Affairs, recruiting veterans to the university, GI Bill beneﬁ  ts and having 
different sections of the required What is 
the Good Life? class for veterans. 
Rosenberg said he wants to especially 
help veterans because they often battle 
issues that other students don’t have to 
deal with. 
Barkley found out she was pregnant after she was released from active duty 
while her husband was stationed else-where.
“I immediately went from being a fe-
male Marine enlisted to a civilian whose 
husband was still in (the service), and 
now, I’m pregnant.” she said, “I have absolutely no skills to apply to the world to get a job.”
The UF community was welcom-
ing, she said. She found a support sys-tem through the society that helped her transition into the civilian and college world. 
“We are doing the things that we 
think, at the trustee level,… (are) encour-aging veterans to be a part of our cam-pus community,” Rosenberg said, “and giving them an opportunity to meet and 
interact and help each other succeed at 
UF, just like many of our other student 
groups on campus.”
There are about 580 self-identiﬁ  ed 
veterans on campus making use of the 
GI Bill, Kratzer said.
The next step in aiding these veterans 
stems from further communication be-
tween university ofﬁ  cials and the group.
“To have him hear ﬁ  rsthand issues 
from students who are veterans going 
to school and to get that directly to the 
Board of Trustees’ level and not to the bureaucracy is really valuable,” Kratzer said.UF group, Board of Trustees

Darts & Laurels  
This week, a group of UF students rallied to give a voice to 
the silenced — the many Venezuelans who have been injured 
and killed during anti-government protests. A media blackout 
has prevented much coverage from reaching the mainstream, so one UF student with intimate ties to the upheaval abroad decided to do something about it. 
This week, we’re handing off a LAUREL to UF student An-
dreina Nash, who produced a video called “What’s going on in Venezuela in a nutshell” to educate people about what’s happening in her native country. The video immediately went viral, proving that small actions can make the signiﬁ  cant im-
pacts — to the tune of more than 2 million hits, in this case. 
In Miami, a back-and-forth struggle that’s held up the re-
lease of a video police made of Justin Bieber shortly after his 
arrest is still in the process of getting settled. 
According to The Associated Press, a judge said Thursday 
that he will review the police tape and determine whether 
some portions should be withheld from the public because of 
lewd content — speciﬁ  cally, a clip of Bieber peeing into a cup as part of a drug test. 
The Bieber camp, obviously, doesn’t want any part of the 
tapes to see the light of day. Outraged members of the media disagree, citing a right to public records that applies to even material involving celebrities.
“The right of privacy cannot trump the right of access to 
public records,” said Deanna Shullman, an attorney for The 
Associated Press and several other media outlets. “My clients 
have no interest in showing Mr. Bieber’s private parts. You 
have to redact that and release the rest.”
That’s right! The public has a right to life, liberty and a 
grainy video clip of JBiebz and the cops. This week, we’re throwing a release-the-tapes-now! DART at the Miami-Dade 
County judge who is delaying this important video from reaching the public. 
Judging by the amount of petition signers and reader mail, 
no one at UF is taking the removal of Jon Anderson’s Bam-booville art installation lying down. And we don’t blame 
them: Bambooville was accessible art, available for students to 
experience whenever they pleased. 
UF said its reasoning for forcing Anderson to dismantle 
Bambooville was because he didn’t go through the appropri-ate channels to have his art approved — though Anderson 
told the Alligator that he made efforts to seek approval and 
build Bambooville on greenhouse land. 
Students are ﬁ  ghting back, and for that, we hand off a 
LAUREL to Jon Anderson and the students who are advocat-
ing for the return of Bambooville.
Have a good weekend, Gators. Wear sunscreen!Manners matter: a common courtesy guide
I always get pegged as nice. When I hold the door 
for a stranger: nice. When I tell someone his back-pack is unzipped: nice. When I inform the barista at 
Starbucks someone left $20 unattended on the counter: nice. 
And sure, I’ll take it. Not everyone does those things. 
But I don’t chalk it all up to niceness. I think of it more as common courtesy. Although I like to think I am nice, more so than that, I am considerate, and more college students should be, too. 
It sounds easy enough, but judging by the number 
of disgusting on-campus bathrooms I’ve opted out of using, the number of times I’ve been woken at ungodly hours by loud neighbors, and the hardships I’ve experi-enced trying to get my bike out of perfectly functioning bike racks, the reality is, a lot of really nice people are pretty inconsiderate.
“If you sprinkle when you tinkle, wipe the seat cause 
then it’s neat.” 
The nursery school rhyme doesn’t present a difﬁ  cult 
concept, but how many times have you found yourself jumping from stall to stall hoping you’ll ﬁ  nd the one toilet that hasn’t been visibly contaminated by someone else’s bodily excretion?
If that sentence sounds disgusting to you, good. 
Maybe you’ll think of me next time you decide you don’t have the time to wipe the toilet seat. 
I hate to sound like a princess —  no, I don’t — but 
if you wake me up in the middle of the night for no good reason, it’s an automatic “I hate you.” Sleep is an essential part of success in life, and having an offbeat schedule is not a good reason to write off the fact that at 2:34 a.m. on a Tuesday or 6 a.m. on a Saturday, others could be asleep.
Personally, the ﬁ  ve hours of sleep I get regularly are 
important to me, and I don’t want to hear about your colon or your who-did-what-when-they-were-drunk screaming match. Not even a little bit. If you have a good enough relationship with your neighbors to be able to borrow a hammer or a garlic clove, don’t you want to keep it that way?
College towns make com-
muters of us all, and whether you bike, scoot or walk around, it’s nice to know you have a 
way to get where you need to be.
When you’re going about your day with an alloted 
time to do each of the things on your list, the last thing you need is to feel stuck, literally. If you can’t ﬁ  nd a spot for your bike on a rack, it is not OK to lock onto said rack in a way that will make it a nightmare for oth-ers to get out. 
If you’re riding your bike, you probably know how 
annoying it is not to be able to access it when you need it. So don’t make it hard on others. If you park in an area that’s typically congested, get there earlier or ﬁ  nd an-other spot. There are plenty of places for bikes on cam-pus. On top of someone else’s isn’t one of them.  
These all seem like common sense, but if they weren’t 
problems I’d encountered more than once, I wouldn’t be mentioning them. 
Sure, that time I told the barista about the unattended 
$20 bill was probably stupid. From the time I opened my mouth to the time my drink order was ready, I observed about seven people walk up to claim the $20. But what if it was the last $20 bill you could spend that week?
While it would be nice to only have to worry about 
yourself, it would be considerate to remember that you’re sharing this world with other people. Other peo-ple who also pee, sleep and commute.

Swamp’s intimidation tactics are 
reprehensible
On Wednesday, I exercised my right as a 
UF student to vote. I wore my “I Voted” stick-
er as I sat eating at a table in the Reitz Union when a girl walked up to me and asked if she could have my sticker. 
Suspiciously, I asked her why. She told me 
that her friend was in a fraternity and needed to collect ten voting stickers, or else he’d be in trouble. This also happened to me in my ﬁ  rst semester of college, but I was asked by a des-perate sorority girl instead. 
Let me tell you something, Swamp Party. 
Or should I say, Unite Party? I voted for every single Taco Libre candidate — there were no 
Students Party members on my ballot — that I 
could. I will never support the corruption and intimidation tactics that you use against your Greek members. 
Next time I vote, I am not giving my sticker 
to anyone. It is reprehensible that Greeks, who only represent about 20 percent of our Student Body, control our entire governing system. I 
urge all the minority parties and anyone not 
involved with these people to stand up to the corruption at our precious university. Know who you are voting for. Know what you are 
voting for. And for the love of God, don’t sup-port these intimidation tactics by giving up 
anything even as trivial as a sticker.

Why Students Party boycotted
On Wednesday night, the results of the 
Spring 2014 Student Government election 
were announced, and the Students Party of-ﬁ  cially chose to boycott the presentation. My name is Olga Rodriguez, president of the Stu-
dents Party, and I would like to explain why.
It’s no secret that Student Government 
is run by Swamp Party. As SG continues to 
put more restrictions on elections, it becomes increasingly difﬁ  cult for oppositions to gain footing.
Students consistently ask Students Party 
campaigners, “Why are there so few of you and so many Swamp campaigners?” Unbe-
knownst  to many students, there are restric-
tions on parties from meeting outside of what has been deemed the “election period.” 
This is just one example of restrictions 
keeping oppositions small. Students DO want to learn about SG as well as make sure their voices are heard. Students Party believes all parties should have the right to inform stu-dents on issues and what is going on in SG. Making people passionate about issues takes 
time and consistency — exactly what opposi-
tion parties are denied.
Swamp Party wants you to think more 
than 90 seats in Senate is indicative of its suc-cess in a democratic election, but this is not a democracy. Democracy is based on “checks and balances” and without the “check,” there is no balance. We hope that having boycotted the election results presentation, students will 
see the injustice present within SG and they 
will join The Students Party in demanding these changes from our “representatives.”

 The future of Bambooville
Bambooville, the oasis of relaxation, inspi-
ration and nature appreciation located in the Bartram and Carr wilderness area, has been dismantled upon mandate from university administration. 
Nick Chrone, several interested students 
and I have been striving to work with the university to keep Bambooville intact. It was taken down because the founder, Jon Ander-son, didn’t go through standard university procedures one year ago to install his bamboo structures, tables, hammocks and ornaments.  
Our goal is to work with the Lakes, Vegeta-
tion and Landscaping as well as the Land Use and Facilities Planning committees by pre-
senting a formal proposal to gain approval to 
restore Bambooville. It is ultimately up to the vice president for business operations, Curtis Reynolds, to make or break Bambooville. 
The comments written by supporters of 
the petitions exemplify the passion and wide range of students in favor of Bambooville. Al-though I started working at Bambooville be-cause I found the area to be healing amid the 
daily grind, seeing the community’s response 
has made me realize this cause is beyond Jon Anderson and myself — it belongs to the stu-dents, and I will continue to work as their rep-resentative. 
If anyone is interested in bringing Bam-
booville back, ﬁ  nd the Facebook page “Re-store Bambooville” to keep up to date as we formulate our proposal and move forward.

Thousands of years from now, historians and archeologists will be scouring Internet archives, and they’re going to ﬁ  nd BuzzFeed. And it’s going to be really embarrassing. 
BuzzFeed is a self-described news 
and entertainment company — and one 
of the more gaudy things on the Internet 
today. Its business model is to create vi-ral, feel-good clickbait content, stuff that will be shared and reposted millions of times across social media platforms. 
It takes many forms: There are quiz-
zes, which are great if you’ve ever won-dered which sandwich best describes you. There are tons of life hacks, and sometimes, real news stories. 
But the ideal form of the BuzzFeed article is the listicle — a literal 
point-by-point list of usually vapid and useless information ﬁ  lled with amusing gifs and images regularly stolen from Reddit. 
They have titles like “The 30 Most Fantastic Skating Outﬁ  ts of 
the ‘90s” and they are the foundation of BuzzFeed’s media empire. Aside from the many accusations of plagiarism, the style has been criticized as lazy. 
Even under criticism, BuzzFeed is immensely popular. It’s one 
of the most shared sites on Facebook and is the premier place on the 
Internet to waste time. 
A quick trip to its about page — which isn’t easy to ﬁ  nd — and 
the whole thing makes a lot more sense. In the video on that page, 
the same phrase keeps popping up: “content-driven social advertis-ing.” 
Slightly more prodding brings you closer to the truth. Years ago, 
BuzzFeed discovered how to manufacture viral content, and it has been using that knowledge to make you buy things. It’s not news or entertainment; it’s a brilliant advertising machine. 
The formula they developed to create viral content is pretty 
simple. They gather information and pictures that are either really relatable or have a high potential for going viral, i.e. things that are funny, outlandish or make people feel good. They organize this in-formation in the most readable form to create relatable and noncon-troversial articles that get millions of views. 
The marketing aspect of this is that BuzzFeed is willing to sell 
a slice of the action to whoever wants the Internet to be full of “13 reasons why everyone should buy their product.” Companies and 
other interests write their own listicles and, subtly or not, promote 
their products/goals through BuzzFeed’s viral content generator. 
It’s impossible to deny BuzzFeed’s success. It’s supposed to 
make $200 million this year — impressive, for what amounts to a catalog of stolen cat pictures. 
In these days when revenues and readerships are falling, media 
outlets everywhere are turning to sponsored content for survival. 
But as sympathetic as I am to the media outlets using sponsored 
content to get by, they’re putting themselves in a precarious situa-
tion. BuzzFeed’s revenue stream may be tempting, but the people 
behind it have no ethics or integrity to sacriﬁ  ce.

Many students and faculty are out-
raged with UF’s harsh decision to remove the popular campus land-
mark Bambooville. But the university’s be-havior on this matter is far from shocking. 
I am writing as a member of what the Alligator once 
dubbed “The Dragon Family.” Like Jon Anderson, the creator and all-around cool guy behind Bambooville, my friends and I have also been stymied in creating public artworks on campus. 
Responsible for the large-scale Pokémon chalkings 
in various locations around campus, we had the singu-lar goal of creating impermanent chalk art to liven up dull areas of campus. Our art was neither a statement 
nor a nuisance. Our only hope was to have fun making 
interesting art and for others to have the joy of ﬁ  nding something beautiful and unexpected on campus. 
Despite our good intentions, UF has fought artists 
like Anderson and my friends. Many times we were given warnings from the university and were told to “go through the proper channels.” 
The bottom line is that UF doesn’t get it. Public art is 
a cultural phenomenon that is hardly new. In the past, 
UF fought grafﬁ  ti on campus by setting up the 34th 
Street Wall and the Norman Hall tunnel as safe spaces to make public art. 
But, artistic expression is not so easily contained. UF 
will fail to eradicate public art on campus. Just walk around and you’ll ﬁ  nd spray-painted foxes, discarded rave ﬂ  iers or Bible quotes written on walls. These impermanent artworks aren’t de-tracting from UF’s image but rather are helping build a picture of the diverse Gator Nation. 
I am not condoning making the entirety of campus a 
grafﬁ  ti free-for-all. But I do believe that there is hypoc-risy and elitism at play when UF won’t let a man keep his bamboo garden but pays a relatively unknown artist $22,000 to paint trees blue. 
What makes blue trees worthy of UF’s approval and 
a harmless Pokémon chalking not? UF is a large cam-pus with lots of room for artistic expansion. By creating simple ways to get a public work approved, UF could 
be a haven for healthy artistic expression. Let Anderson 
keep Bambooville, and let students perform great feats — with permission. There is room for both blue trees and bamboo furniture. 
To UF students and faculty, I suggest seeing Bam-
booville before it’s gone. It’s a hidden gem on campus. Sign the petitions — at change.org search for Bamboov-ille —  and let your voices be heard. Don’t let it become the unﬁ  nished Dragonite on Weimer Hall. 
To the UF administrators responsible for stiﬂ  ing art 
on campus, I suggest you go read some grafﬁ  ti from Pompeii. Those guys had more colorful words to de-scribe people who restrict free expression.

The health beneﬁ  ts of drinking coffee are 
numerous. Coffee contains more useful antioxidants than any other food in a typi-
cal diet. If you drink it daily, you’ll lower your risk of getting Parkinson’s, liver disease, skin 
cancer, type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s. 
However, the most striking health beneﬁ  t that I noticed 
while researching for this post was coffee’s ability, appar-
ently, to make you happier. 
A 1999 study conducted in Sweden by Fredholm et al. 
looked at the structure of adenosine receptors. Fredholm et al. found that adenosine receptors were colocalized with dopamine receptors. Colocalization occurs when one type of receptor is located next to or nearby a second receptor. Co-
localization can have a number of effects — in some cases, 
activation of one receptor will boost activation of a colocal-ized receptor. According to Fredholm et al., activation of ad-enosine receptors does the opposite — it depresses activation of dopamine receptors.
This means that when adenosine receptors 
are suppressed, dopamine receptors will be more active. Dopamine, as the biology majors among us may know, is responsible primarily for regu-
lating our reward system. When we ﬁ  nish an essay or ﬁ  nish a yummy meal, our brain releases dopamine, making us feel happy and satisﬁ  ed. Therefore, when you drink coffee, the caffeine will block your adenosine receptors, in turn freeing up your dopamine receptors. 
But short-term dopamine release isn’t all. Coffee acts for 
longer periods of time than most other dopamine boosters like, say, food. Longer-term release of certain hormones, like serotonin, have been known to boost neuron growth. 
So, drink up! (And poop, because coffee does that too, ap-
parently.)

Recent UF alumnus Josh McLawhorn 
bested 400 competitors to win ﬁ  rst place 
with his short ﬁ  lm “Almost Ready” in Nikon’s nationwide Everyday Cinema video contest last week.
The theme of the contest was to spot-
light ordinary moments in life and make them extraordinary in 180 seconds. 
McLawhorn’s three-minute video 
features his girlfriend, UF alumna Ga-briela Rodeiro, bathing in a river and applying wild berries as lipstick while McLawhorn anxiously waits in the car outside her apartment. 
Michelle Ubben, a spokeswoman for 
Sachs Media Group — the company that owns Nikon — praised McLawhorn for earning the title at such a young age. The ﬁ  lm will appear on Nikon’s web-site, and he’ll receive $18,000 worth of top-of-the-line Nikon camera equip-ment, she said. 
After submitting the ﬁ  nal version of the ﬁ  lm, McLawhorn said, “We just 
sat back and said ‘There’s no way that 
could have been done any better.’”
A summer job as a camp photog-
rapher for the YMCA when he was 17 sparked his interest in the cinematic world. McLawhorn graduated from UF with a degree in biochemistry, but he still found time to hone his skills while on campus. He was the photographer 
for the Student Honors Organization 
and also for a local publication, the Rough Draft. 
McLawhorn is currently a producer 
and photographer at Impact Visual Me-dia in Tallahassee. 
Chucha Barber, one of McLawhorn’s 
co-workers, said McLawhorn has an ad-mirable work ethic, and she’s keeping 
him in mind for future projects.
“We have a feature ﬁ  lm in progress 
and see Josh as the ﬁ  lmmaker and di-
rector,” she said.  “My partner and I are structuring the company so one day Josh will take over, and we can sit back and take part of the proﬁ  t.”  UF grad takes grand prize in

Computer programmers will come to-
gether Saturday to create applications that 
will make information in Gainesville’s open data portal more digestible for residents.
The event, called Hoggetowne Hack, will 
take place from 11:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. at the Hippodrome State Theatre. The main event is an app-creation contest, which offers more than $2,000 worth of cash prizes that will be distributed to ﬁ  rst, second and third place winners.
This event’s goal is to “encourage prob-
lem solving of local issues using the data that is on the portal,” said Samantha Wolfe, se-
nior administrative analyst for the city. 
The Open Data portal is, as deﬁ  ned by 
Wolfe, an online repository of public data.
“There’s currently about 20 data sets that we’ve collected from various departments 
that anyone can go to the portal and access,” she said.
All data sets are enabled so developers 
can use the data to create applications, she said.
Lila Stewart, senior strategic planner for 
the city, said she’s expecting teams of data-base analysts, programmers and those with other skillsets who could help make the ap-plication. 
This event is part of International Open 
Data Day, a worldwide movement encourag-ing the creation of applications that use open data to promote government transparency.
Sara Schuster, a UF computer science ju-
nior and founder of Women in Computer Science and Engineering, said she appreci-ates the hackathon’s six-hour length.
Most stretch on for days, leaving partici-
pants with little time for sleep, she said.
 “It’s a really great starter hackathon,” she

Gators try out for national team
Florida volleyball players Simone Antwi, Mackenzie Dagostino, Alex 
Holston and Gabby Mallette are trying out for the USA Women’s National Team. Coach Mary Wise will serve as an evaluator.
Young honored
UF center Patric Young was named a Capital One 
Academic All-American on Thursday. Young has a 3.37 GPA, according to Florida’s website.The UF women’s tennis team takes a West Coast swing this weekend. Read the story online at alligatorSports.org.JONATHAN CZUPRYN

Billy Donovan did not waste any time letting the 
media know who played the better game Wednes-
day night.
“First, I thought Auburn outplayed us,” the 18th-
year coach said to open the postgame press confer-ence. “You know, saying it like it is.”
Despite the sluggish defensive performance for 
the majority of the game for the Gators, whose 10 allowed threes were the most since Arkansas sunk 10 in an overtime loss, No. 2 Florida stepped up in the final minutes to snatch a 71-66 victory out of the hands of defeat. 
But Donovan recognized the eight-point come-
back at halftime, which was the biggest deficit at the break since UF was last ranked No. 2 on Feb. 5, 2013, couldn’t have been achieved without a hand.
“We got some help from Auburn coming down 
the stretch,” Donovan said.
If it wasn’t for an errant foul by the Tigers’ 
Asauhn Dixon-Tatum on Patric Young during a free-throw rebound, the Gators would have been 
forced to sink a last-second bucket or face overtime 
for the second time this season.
Instead, Young hit both his free throws to put 
Florida ahead 68-66. 
And when Auburn had a chance to either tie or 
win the contest, it threw the following inbound pass into UF’s bench to essentially seal victory for the Gators.
Although Donovan’s team allowed zero field 
goals in the game’s final four minutes while hitting 8 of the last 10 free throws, luck doesn’t hurt during a 30-game home winning streak.
According to KenPom.com, Florida is the 71st 
luckiest team in the nation and second luckiest in the Southeastern Conference — behind Mississippi State.
“I think Auburn had a lot more bounce; they 
were a lot more lively; they played fearlessly ... They 
knew where the ball was going, what they were do-
ing and they made plays when they needed to make plays,” Donovan said.Despite the laundry list of things the Tigers did 
better than the Gators on Wednesday night, Florida is still the team up for the No. 1 spot in the country, not Auburn.
And because his team earned the win, Donovan 
said he was going to celebrate it. He said he and his guys are happy for every victory, no matter how ugly it could have been.
However, he added that is not going to let him 
stop pursuing perfection because the last minute of the game isn’t always going to work out the way the Gators like.
“They are in uncharted territory,” Donovan said 
of his squad. “And I’ve got to find a way to do a better job in terms of mentally getting them to play close to their potential.”
Hill doubtful: After sitting out Wednesday’s 
win over Auburn with a groin injury from the Ken-tucky contest, Kasey Hill is doubtful for Saturday’s matchup with Ole Miss on the road.
“Hill is not progressing as fast as we thought he 
would,” Donovan said.
The freshman point guard suffered a sprained 
— not a pulled — groin Saturday in Lexington, Ky., Donovan added.
Without Hill’s 23.3 minutes per game in the back-
court, the Gators were forced to play DeVon Walker 14 minutes Wednesday night, which was the most for the sophomore guard since playing 22 minutes on Jan. 14 against Georgia when Casey Prather was out with a right knee bruise.
Walk-on Jacob Kurtz also saw the floor when 
Michael Frazier II temporarily left the game with a right wrist injury. Kurtz’s five minutes on the court marked the first time he entered a game since play-
ing six minutes against Texas A&M on Feb. 1.
With both Prather (ankle) and Young (knees) not 
at 100 percent either, both Walker and Kurtz could 
see more playing time in Oxford, Miss.

James Madison has not been this em-
barrassed since the War of 1812.
The No. 7 Gators  (3-1) took their third 
consecutive win of the season against the 
Dukes on Thursday night, winning 21-8.
However, it wasn’t without a fight.Winning the first half 17-3 on draw con-
trols and shooting 24 times, Florida came out in the second half as if it had already ensured its win, closing the first 30 min-utes 16-3.
However, at the start of the second half, 
the Dukes came out looking to stop a run-ning clock and to get the game back into their control. The team scored three con-secutive goals in the first five minutes of 
the second half, threatening to overtake 
the Gators; Florida countered after JMU scored its three points, but the Gators managed to lose the draw-control battle after bringing the score 17-6.
But the Dukes’ 3-0 run didn’t change 
the outcome of the game.
In addition to JMU’s attempt to create 
momentum at the start of the second half, 
both teams got physical early in the first 
half. 
The physicality caused James Madi-
son’s Stephanie Finley to leave the game early after being hit in the face by a Florida player’s net. 
She later returned to the game sporting 
a bandaged forehead.
Later, JMU’s Carter 
Reifsnider was given a yellow card after she knocked down junior 
Shannon Gilroy from be-
hind with her net. She sat 
out until Florida scored 30 seconds later.
Juniors Gilroy and 
Nora Barry and sophomore Sam Darcan-gelo helped lead the Gators in their feat against the Dukes by beating JMU on draw controls, shots and clears.Standing at 6-foot-2, sophomore Devon 
Schneider also aided in winning the draw 
controls Thursday. With the advantage of 
height on Schneider’s side she picked two of her draw controls from the air. Schneider also put three points on the board  and was one of seven scorers for the Gators.
“It’s really important for me to come 
out here and play my hardest every time,” Schneider said about her job on draw con-trols. “Everyday at practice, we go hard. 
There’s always girls that want to be out 
here, so everybody’s fighting.”
Barry also had an outstanding night, 
breaking a career high with eight draw

Nora Barry drives the ball toward the net during Florida’s 18-7 win 
against High Point on Saturday at Donald R. Dizney Stadium.
Barry notches eight draw controls
controls and two points. Barry contributed the re-
cord-breaking night to her team; however, coach Amanda O’Leary said that eight draw controls are 
natural for Barry.
“This is the Nora we know,” O’Leary said. “We 
see this everyday at practice, so it doesn’t come as 
a surprise to us watching this performance because 
this is what she does every day.”
The junior midﬁ  elder has progressively gotten 
better with each game of the season. She started out 
the season at No. 1 North Carolina with no points. Since UNC, she has almost doubled her draw con-
trols and points with each game.
“We knew from scouting JMU at the ball that 
their draw person could really control it,” Barry 
Said. 
“We knew where it was going.”Freshman Sammi Burgess also had a solid night, 
putting up two points and two assists. Burgess is 
the most consistent player of all the freshmen on the 
team and has a combined total of nine points for the season and six assists.
Burgess said Tuesday that the Dukes defense 
would be the most challenging, aside from UNC, that the Gators had faced yet. Having played with some of the players that are on JMU’s defense, she 
said it would be tough.
“I think that we prepare so well the days before 
the game that we’re ready,” Burgess said. 
“We know what we’re going to be dealing with 
and I think it really helps because we get out there 
and we’re composed.”LACROSSE , from page 13SOFTBALL

Coach Tim Walton likes what 
he has seen from his team so far 
this season.
“There’s a lot of bright spots, a 
lot of good things,” Walton said. 
“But I think the most important 
thing for me is we’ve been really consistent with our work ethic, consistent with our approach. We’ve come out to play every sin-gle game.”
Of Florida’s 10 players who 
have started at least eight of UF’s ﬁ  rst 12 games, seven posted a bat-ting average of at least .333 and six have recorded double-digit RBI totals. In those ﬁ  rst 12 games, the Gators outscored their opponents 
105-19.
Walton hopes that consistency 
continues when the No. 1 Gators 
host the three-day Lipton Invita-tional.
No. 1 Florida (12-0) opens up its 
six-game slate with a doubleheader tonight, playing Troy (4-5-1) at 4 p.m. followed by a contest against 
Indiana (1-9) at 6:15 p.m.
With the team playing three 
consecutive doubleheaders, Wal-ton plans on using the tournament 
at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium to experiment with some position players and give some of his ros-
ter more playing 
time.
“One of the 
things we’re go-ing to try to do a good job of is getting Taylore Fuller a little more reps be-hind the plate,” 
Walton said. “It’s something that I’ve talked to Aubree Munro about. You know, it’s a long season. Au-bree has caught a bunch of our games for us so far.”
Walton also aims to give addi-
tional playing time to junior Briana Little and freshman Chelsea Hern-
don this weekend.
In their combined 10 at-bats this 
season, Little and Herndon accu-
mulated ﬁ  ve RBIs on a .400 batting average. Although the sample size is small, Walton is impressed with what he has seen from them.
“Briana Little and Chelsea Hern-
don have had good pinch-hits for 
us all season long and they need to 
get some starts now,” he said. “So I’m hoping to get them a couple starts and just keep plugging on the same things that we’re doing.”
In the pitcher’s circle, Walton 
will be rotating his usual trio of starters: senior Hannah Rogers, ju-
nior Lauren Haeger and freshman 
Delanie Gourley. All three have four wins under their belts this sea-son, and the starting rotation has combined for 75 strikeouts against only 17 walks.
“That’s not easy when you’re 
putting together a team to have three quality pitchers like that and 
keep them happy,” Walton said. 
“I’m really happy with the way all three of them are pitching.”

Kevin O’Sullivan went against the grain re-
cruiting center ﬁ  elder Buddy Reed and right-
hander Logan Shore. The two freshmen, from Rhode Island and Minnesota, respectively, aren’t the typical Gators.
They couldn’t play baseball year-round in 
sunny North-Central Florida. Instead, they satisﬁ  ed their sports ﬁ  x with something else — hockey.
“We talk it up a little bit,” Shore said. 
“It’s good competition. I know he was pretty good. I wish we could play each other. That would’ve been fun.”
Reed starred at Middletown (R.I) St. 
George’s School in baseball, hockey and soc-cer. He wasn’t just a highly touted baseball prospect — Providence recruited him to play hockey. 
The 6-foot-3, 200-pound outﬁ  elder dis-
played his athleticism in his ﬁ  rst few games, 
scoring from second after Maryland third 
baseman Jose Cuas’ toss home trickled away from catcher Kevin Martir in the Gators’ home opener on Feb. 14.
Shore pitched 5.1 scoreless innings against 
UCF on Tuesday in his collegiate debut. 
O’Sullivan favors multi-sport athletes. He 
thinks there is an edge to them. 
Right-hander Johnny Magliozzi, now with 
the New York Mets, went 8-5 in his two-year Florida career. Magliozzi, from East Milton, Mass., skated for the East Miltion (Mass.) Dex-ter School hockey team.
“As far as recruiting is concerned, you like guys that play different sports. It’s athleti-cism. It’s competitive spirit. It’s teamwork,” O’Sullivan said. “If you ask most people on the recruiting side, they’ll probably tell you the same thing.”Kish staying as student assistant: Al-
though junior right-hander Keenan Kish will miss the entire season due to Tommy John surgery, he won’t be far from the program.
O’Sullivan is keeping Kish on as an assis-tant coach. The redshirt junior missed all of last season because of a hip injury. 
O’Sullivan described this latest setback as 
disappointing for such a well-liked player in Kish.
Florida made Kish’s injury public on Sun-
day.
“He is going to be with us the entire year. 
He is going to be used in a lot of different ca-
pacities,” O’Sullivan said. “No one feels worse 
for him than we do. His teammates have ral-lied around him. It’s a shame, but he’s a vital part of our program and we’re going to use him in every way possible.” 
Rotation staying put: O’Sullivan has elect-
ed to use the same starting rotation that threw 10.2 innings against Maryland last weekend. 
Junior left-hander Bobby Poyner will pitch 
the opener at Mark Light Stadium on Friday against No. 16 Miami (2-2). while right-hand-ers Brett Morales and Karsten Whitson will pitch Saturday and Sunday.
“It’s too early in the year to change. I 
don’t want to have any knee-jerk reactions,” O’Sullivan said.
“There’s a reason why we set the rotation. 
Those guys have pitched well for a long pe-
riod of time before the season started. It’s not 
fair to people to start making changes after the ﬁ  rst weekend. I don’t think that’s right.”
Lefty trio powers Hurricanes: It’s been two 
years since No. 23 Florida visited Miami. The Gators, with players like Fontana, Johnson, Tucker and Zunino, swept the Hurricanes in 2011.

It was a deﬁ  ning day for Florida’s No. 1 men’s and No. 
5 women’s swimming and diving teams at the Southeastern 
Conference Championships. 
The defending SEC champion Gators men’s squad moved 
into ﬁ  rst, ahead of No. 13 Auburn, picking up two more gold 
medals on Day 3 while the women also earned their ﬁ  rst two 
wins but remain in second behind No. 1 Georgia.
The Bulldogs top-ranked women’s team sat on a pedes-
tal of perfection having won all 15 event ﬁ  nals heading into the third day of competition, but senior Elizabeth Beisel put a quick end to that by claiming gold in the 400-yard individual medley (3:59.26) for Florida to start Day 3’s ﬁ  nals. It was Beisel’s ﬁ  rst win at this year’s conference meet and 
eighth overall, giving her a career sweep at SECs in the 400-yard IM. 
“It’s pretty cool to be able to 
say that I’ve won it four years in a row,” Beisel said. “I don’t think many people have done that, so 
there was a little bit of pressure before the race.”
In the next event for the women, senior Ellese Zalewski 
gave the Gators their second gold in the 100-yard butterﬂ  y (51.58) with a 0.11 second difference between ﬁ  rst and second. It was Zalewski’s ﬁ  rst SEC title.
Although Georgia’s Chase Kalisz won the 400-yard IM by 
more than two seconds on the men’s side, Florida rounded off the podium with Dan Wallace in second (3:38.96) and Connor Signorin in third (3:43.34).But it was senior Marcin Cieslak that had another strong 
day for the Gators. After a silver medal performance in the 200-yard IM on Day 2 and swimming the ﬂ  y leg on the gold-medal winning 200-yard medley relay on Day 1, Cieslak grabbed his ﬁ  rst individual gold this year and seventh career individual conference championship when he defended his title in the 100-yard ﬂ  y (45.59 seconds). 
Finishing off the meet was the 200-yard freestyle that fea-
tured Florida’s defending champion senior Pawel Werner, but he missed the podium by 0.23 seconds. Senior Sebastien Rousseau captured his ﬁ  rst individual SEC title (1:33.23). Not far behind was freshman Mitch D’Arrigo, ﬁ  nishing in sec-ond.
“They came in this morning and did what they had to do,” 
coach Gregg Troy said, “then came back at night and were even better.” Gator men move into ﬁ  rst place at SEC Championships

No. 2 UF will take on an equal 
challenger in No. 3 LSU at the 
O’Connell Center tonight, but two Gators will have personal challenges out on the ﬂ  oor. 
For the ﬁ  rst time this season, 
the Gators will compete against gymnasts who had already re-corded a 10 earlier in the season. 
Kytra Hunter and Bridget 
Sloan will put their skills on ﬂ  oor, vault and balance beam to the test against LSU juniors Rheagan Courville and Lloimin-
cia Hall, who have scored 10s on 
vault and ﬂ  oor, respectively.
UF (6-0, 4-0 Southeastern Con-
ference) hosts LSU (7-2, 3-1 SEC) in the Gators’ annual Link to Pink meet at 7 p.m. in the O’Connell Center. 
During their 2013 title run, the 
Gators suffered a loss to the Ti-gers in their second meet of the regular season. 
“It was very early in the sea-
son, and I think that really was a great lesson for us,” coach Rhon-da Faehn said. 
“Bridget (Sloan) said, ‘That’s 
not going to happen again,’ and it certainly didn’t happen again.” 
Hunter, who was named SEC 
Specialist of the Week for her 10 
on vault against Arkansas, has 
recovered from the stomach ﬂ  u that prevented her from compet-ing on ﬂ  oor. 
LSU’s Courville also scored 
a 10 on vault (the second of her career) last week and she was named SEC Gymnast of the Week — a title Florida gymnasts have dominated every week since the start of the season. 
But the Gators insist they are 
not doing anything special to 
prepare for the Tigers.
“They’re doing very well this 
year, but ... we work hard every 
week,” sophomore Bridgette Ca-quatto said. 
“We work towards perfec-
tion as a team every single week no matter who we’re going against.”
With the 2014 regular season 
winding down, Faehn said she is ready to start work on postseason lineups. 
“We’re really trying to put a 
lineup together for this meet that we would consider similar to, if not playing around with the lineup that would be postseason” 
Faehn said. 
“We’re still not sure of it 100 
percent no doubt. And, of course, 
we’re not sure of the order just yet but we’re working towards that. I think it’ll be the closest thing so far this season.” 
The Gators had a variety of 
looks in their starting lineup in 
the past six meets. Most recently, 
regular all-arounders Hunter and Mackenzie Caquatto sat out on ﬂ  oor against Arkansas. Faehn ex-pects them both to be back in the lineup. 
Faehn said freshman Claire 
Boyce would likely make the cut for balance beam and ﬂ  oor in the postseason and tonight’s lineup. Boyce has competed in both events for the Gators at all 
six meets. 
Florida’s other freshman, Sil-
via Colussi-Pelaez, will likely not 
compete on any events tonight, Faehn said.16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 21, 2014

The road to the NCAA 
tournament got a lot tougher 
for the Gators on Thursday night in the O’Connell Center.
Missouri made it rain three-
pointers in its 81-76 victory. 
“It’s just really disappoint-
ing to lose on our home ﬂ  oor and to lose exactly in the way that we knew they were going to play,” coach Amanda Butler said. “It doesn’t show a lot of commitment to the practices we put in the past two days.”
The Tigers — one of the 
best three-point shooting teams in the country, let alone the SEC — sunk 12 shots from beyond the arc. 
Six of them came from ju-
nior Morgan Eye, the SEC’s top three-point shooter. 
A beleaguered Butler 
couldn’t ﬁ  nd a reason why her team let Eye get so many good looks. 
“I don’t have a great expla-
nation for why we would give so many attempts to Morgan,” she said.
“She gave them such en-
ergy and made such big plays. 
For the kid that, I think, is the 
best shooter in our league to 
get 10 attempts … that shows 
that we didn’t have the com-
mitment on defense to the things that we practiced. 
“I clearly must’ve focused on the wrong things coming into the game.”
Although Missouri was 
brilliant from three-point range — making 12 of 25 — Florida was in striking dis-tance for most of the game.
Redshirt junior Kayla 
Lewis posted another double-double, scoring 20 points and grabbing 10 boards. 
“I just want to do my job 
for my team,” Lewis said. “If that means scoring 20 points and getting 10 rebounds, so be it. Obviously, that wasn’t enough tonight.”
At halftime, the Gators 
were leading 34-30, but Mis-souri’s 8 for 11 effort from 
distance in the second half ul-
timately did Florida in. 
Eye and freshman Sierra 
Michaelis accounted for seven of the Tigers’ three-pointers in the half and 10 of their 12 for the game. 
“What we did clearly didn’t 
work,” Butler said. “It’s not a 
secret that Missouri wants to 
shoot the three-ball. 
“Michaelis shot it really 
well, and that was a little bit different than what we had seen.” 
What may have contrib-
uted most to Missouri’s main-tained excellence from three-
point range was Florida’s lack 
of communication. 
“We just had some com-
munication breakdowns,” Butler said.
