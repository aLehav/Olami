Tickets for tonight’s Accent Speak-
er’s Bureau show with Neil deGrasse 
Tyson, a nationally renown astrophysi-cist, ran out in 30 minutes.
The free tickets were handed out 
at the Phillips Center for the Perform-ing Arts box ofﬁ  ce at noon Tuesday for students. There are no public-viewing tickets because they usually come from leftover student tickets.
The event starts at 8 p.m. at the Phil-
lips Center. Doors open at 7 p.m.
Accent Chairman Josh Holtzman 
said he didn’t expect the tickets to go so 
fast.
“We were all 
surprised by how quickly the tickets sold out,” said the 22-year-old UF po-litical science and history senior. “But of course we’re sorry 
that there weren’t 
enough tickets for everyone to get in.”
Holtzman said he did not know ex-
actly how many tickets were distribut-ed, but the center has about 1,600 seats.
However, he said, for those who 
didn’t get tickets, the event will be re-corded and projected on screens out-side.
In response to student concern about 
the lack of tickets, Holtzman said, some ticketing processes are out of Accent’s control.
“We’re always interested in improv-
ing our operations and learning from our experiences, and after the show, we may re-evaluate some of the ticketing procedures to create a more equitable 
distribution.”
He said Accent does not approve of 
students selling the tickets, and he has 
advised his staff to monitor Craigslist and delete posts that solicit money for tickets.
Dragana Tabakovic, a 21-year-old 
anthropology junior, received a ticket.
“Since it’s sold out,” she said, “I’ll 
probably get there at 5 at the very lat-est.”

When Mike Campbell got the call to par-
ticipate in the Greater Gator Beer Festival last 
year, he was ready to join the tradition.
The general manager of EndZone, 1209 
W. University Ave., provided food and 
drinks for the VIP area of the beer and food sampling festival.
This year, the City of Gainesville didn’t al-
low the 16-year-old festival to return to Mag-
nolia Parke, 4700 NW 39th Ave.
“It’s a bummer,” Campbell said. “Things 
like this, they’re needed. People get together, hang out — it’s high-spirited fun.”
Chuck Fazio and Ricki Black, festival coor-
dinators, said they were told by the city attor-ney’s ofﬁ  ce that ordinances or statutes hadn’t changed, only their interpretation.
“It’s all bologna with a capital B,” Fazio 
said. “After 16 years and nothing changing, it 
seems a little ﬁ  shy.”

Nightlife Navigators Chair-
man Cristian Arango announced 
at the Student Senate meeting Tuesday that the Student Night-time Auxiliary Patrol’s service area will extend one block north of West University Avenue start-ing at the end of the semester.
Arango said students can 
request rides to Emerson Hall and Classroom Building 105. All drop-off and pick-up locations are on Northwest First Avenue.
The UF General Counsel ap-
proved the One More Block ini-tiative Thursday, Arango said.
He said the agency is working to fund three more SNAP vans at about $30,000 each to travel to three other locations north of 
University Avenue. Two of the 
three new vans would transport students behind Hillel, St. Au-gustine Catholic Church and next to Classroom Building 105. He hopes these vans and locations will be added by Summer B.
“We worked really hard be-
cause we saw there was a need in the Student Body,” said Nightlife Navigators Chief of Staff Chris Ceresa.
Arango said the initiative is 
part of his legacy as chairman.
“I wanted to design a SG 
agency that would be required to promise the Student Body that it would lobby to make our cam-pus safer,” he said.

After six years, Mihoko Tsutsumi is directing 
her last concert at UF tonight.
The 53-year-old UF School of Music adjunct 
lecturer and director of the Men’s Glee Club and 
Women’s Chorale, will become the director of cho-ral activities at the State University of New York at Oswego in the Fall.
Her last concert is the annual UF Men’s Glee 
Club and Women’s Chorale Spring Concert at 7:30 p.m. in the University Auditorium. It is free and open to the public.
“We are sad that she is leaving,” said Beauty 
Kolenc, a 25-year-old public relations senior. “But, we are really happy for her to have this opportu-nity.”
Kolenc is the public relations chairwoman for 
Women’s Chorale and has been a member since 
Fall 2012.
Apart from regular, classical choir music, the 
groups will perform music that ranges from Afri-
can to Spanish and pop songs.
The UF Symphony Orchestra will also perform. 
Visiting musician Satoko Someya will play the koto, a traditional Japanese stringed instrument, and UF School of Music faculty members Steven Thomas and Leslie Odom will play the cello and 
oboe, respectively.
Russell Robinson, a School of Music faculty 
member, will debut a composition he has dedicat-
ed to Tsutsumi that Women’s Chorale will sing.
“It’s an exciting concert,” Tsutsumi said. “It 
will be great to see the unity of students and fac-ulty performing.”

Glee Club and choir director Mihoko Tsutsumi will lead her 
final performance at 7:30 p.m. in the University Auditorium. It’s free and will feature more than 100 performers.

�THE STABBING WAS THE 65TH TIME ASO HAS 
RESPONDED TO AN INCIDENT AT THE BAR.
KATHRYN VARN
Alligator Staff Writer
A stabbing early Monday outside of a southwest 
Gainesville bar left an Alachua man in critical condition 
and Alachua County Sheriff’s Office deputies searching 
for the culprit.
Brett Johnson, 30, was taken to Shands at UF with 
multiple stab wounds after a fight broke out just before 
3 a.m. outside of All Star Sports Bar in the 4200 block 
of Southwest 13th Street, said ASO spokesman Art 
Forgey.
Bystanders in line with Johnson helped control the 
bleeding and drove him to the hospital, Forgey said. By the time deputies arrived at the bar, Johnson was 
gone.
As of Tuesday afternoon, investigators had not 
talked to Johnson about the incident because he was 
still in treatment, Forgey said.
Because the case is still under investigation,  Forgey 
could not provide any more information.
Johnson’s stabbing was the 65th incident at the 
bar that has required ASO’s intervention since the beginning of the year, according to an ASO call list.
Deputies have been called to the bar for various 
incidents such as noise complaints, grand theft auto and beverage and narcotics violations. 
Johnson’s incident was the only reported stabbing 
at the bar.
Bar owners could not be reached for comment.

After about three years spaying 
and neutering cats and dogs, Sandi 
Richmond said her organization is nearing a milestone.
No More Homeless Pets, which 
offers discounted spaying and neu-tering, is approaching its 15,000th surgery. It began tallying when the organization started in late 2009.
Richmond said she expects the or-
ganization to reach the goal no later than April 16.
Spaying and neutering helps re-
duce the county’s animal population, 
she said, and it lowers the number of 
animals that are euthanized.
In February 2012, Richmond said, 
Alachua County Animal Services eu-thanized 438 animals. This February, it euthanized 25.
Honey Langford, a 34-year-old 
Santa Fe College business supervi-sion and management senior who volunteers at the clinic, said she was surprised by the statistics.
“If you just step back and think 
about that for a second, that is just a phenomenal number of animals to be able to spay and neuter,” she said. 
Other factors that influenced the 
dropped rate include animal rescue groups and the Hope Fund, which launched in February, Richmond said. 
“Pets are expensive,” Richmond 
said. “In order to do the right thing and to save lives, even at our low rate, it’s sometimes very difficult for 
people.”

City will revise the ordinance
nance that dealt with alcoholic beverage sales permits for outdoor special events.
In early 2012, a group of city staff determined the code didn’t allow the city to 
issue such permits in most circumstances, City Attorney Nicolle Shalley wrote in an 
email to city staff March 7. 
During the March 21 City Commission meeting, an item that requested the revi-
sion of the ordinance to expand permits citywide was approved.
Fazio and Black have been hosting Florida Beer Festivals for 20 years, after they 
attended a beer festival in San Francisco. They started in Orlando and brought the festival to Gainesville in 1997.
“It was an immediate hit,” Fazio said.They host eight to 10 festivals a year around Florida in cities like Boca Raton, Fort 
Lauderdale and Sarasota, which usually draw 2,000 to 3,500 people.
For the price of admission, each festival features at least 100 different kinds of 
2-ounce beer samples from distributors, suppliers and breweries. Fazio said he and 
Black also seek restaurants to provide free samples because they don’t want people 
to drink all day without eating.
Last year, Gainesville businesses like Beef ‘O’ Brady’s, Willy’s Mexicana Grill 
and Loosey’s participated in the festival.
Fazio had hoped to bring the festival back this summer, but he said it will prob-
ably have to wait until next year, when the city is done revising the ordinance.        
“We have a lot of people very upset,” he said, “but you can’t fight City Hall.”BEER , from page 1NATHALIE DORTONNE

After Joanna Galaris caught the eye of a UF 
law student at Karma Cream, he began to talk 
to her.
He offered to walk her home, and later, he 
asked her to have sex.
When she turned him down, he was out-raged.
“He seemed to think that asking me to 
have sex with him was an acceptable thing,” the 21-year-old UF anthropology senior said. “I feel that a lot of college-age men are con-fused as to what permission is.”
Galaris is one of about 200 people expected 
to attend Gainesville’s Take Back The Night tonight to raise awareness about sexual vio-lence. Take Back The Night is a nationwide event that often features marches, rallies and personal testimonies.
Tonight’s event will begin at 5:30 p.m. on 
Turlington Plaza, but the march will start at 6 p.m. At 7 p.m., survivors and supporters will have the chance to share stories and support on the Reitz Union Colonnade. Event orga-nizer Ashley Cortez, a victim advocate coun-selor at the Alachua County Victim Services and Rape Crisis Center, said the event is larger 
than awareness.
“People are beginning to come to the real-
ization that rape is not as black and white as 
what people previously thought,” the 27-year-old said. “Sexual assault doesn’t always hap-pen by a stranger. It’s more than likely going to be someone you know and trust.”Take Back The Night event to raise sexual violence awareness

◗ ANYONE INKED AFTER JAN. 1 CAN DONATE.

Marissa Torres was told that getting a tattoo would keep her 
from donating blood for 365 days.
Until Tuesday, blood donors who got a tattoo had to wait a 
year to donate.
But now, Torres, a 19-year-old UF recreation, parks and tourism freshman, doesn’t have to wait. She, and anyone else 
who was inked after Jan. 1, can donate blood to any LifeSouth 
Community Blood Center now.
LifeSouth announced it was lifting the one-year deferral for 
donors with tattoos because of increased regulations on Florida 
tattoo parlors.Florida became the 30th state to pass a law tightening tattoo 
parlor restrictions. It went into effect Jan. 1, 2012.
LifeSouth Director of Recruitment and Retention Galen 
Unold said LifeSouth had to wait a year for tattoo parlors to comply with the law and for the law to meet the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s requirements. Torres said that she will donate blood now that the deferral has been lifted.
“We shouldn’t be punished for getting a tattoo,” she said. 
“It wouldn’t have any significant determination on how good the blood is.”

Women may appear to out-think men in 
the corporate world, but men don’t appear to 
take notice — a fact that has some UF women 
speaking out.
When competing interests are at stake, 
women are better than men at consistently 
making fair decisions, according to a recent study from researchers at A.T. Still University in Arizona and McMaster University in Can-ada.
The study consisted of about 620 Cana-
dian board directors: 75 percent males and 25 
percent females. The directors were tested on 
three factors that go into decision making: self-interest, normative preference and complex moral reasoning.Although both genders scored the highest 
in complex moral reasoning — or making con-sistently fair decisions — Chris Bart, co-author of the study, said that women scored much higher than men.
Even though the study showed women 
make better board members than men, Bart said, women are largely outnumbered on cor-porate boards — a trend that UF student Jes-sica Trad said needs to change.
“It’s unfair,” the 18-year-old UF statistics 
freshman said. “I think it should be equal.”
Donna Roberts, administrative assistant at 
UF Warrington College of Business Adminis-tration, said that it’s best to have a variety of 
board members when making decisions.
“I think it’s important for [women] to not 
undervalue their contributions to a company,” 
she said.Women work fairly, study sayslifEstylEWEDNESDAY, APRIL 3, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

UF’s Institute of Black Culture hosted  
an interest meeting Tuesday for Blueprint, 
a self-development program that will start this Fall for first- and second-year black male students.
The program was inspired by the MTV 
show “From G’s to Gents” which featured misguided young men in a competition to become respectable gentlemen.
“It started with the question, ‘If I can 
make the perfect UF student, what traits and qualities would this student have?’” said Vee Smith, the institute and program’s director.
About 10 students will be selected for 
the opportunity to advance their profes-sional and social lives through personalized etiquette, dress, academic and job prepara-tion guidance. Blueprint will meet for three hours each week for sessions consisting of a combination of lectures and interactive activities, Smith said.
“Some [programs] only cover academics 
or maybe just your social side,” Smith said. “This combines everything and provides personal attention to each participant.”
Students will have the opportunity to network and learn from professionals throughout the semester. Upon comple-tion of the program, students will receive a business suit and photo shoot. The most improved will receive a $1,000 scholarship.
Alex Montano said he’s most interested 
in the etiquette and future professionalism aspects of the program.
“I believe there is always room for im-
provement,” said the 20-year-old UF elec-trical engineering sophomore.
Smith has led a similar program at the 
University of Kentucky since 2008 and said the rewards go beyond the program’s rig-
orous few months.
Mirland Terlonge and Tahiri Jean-
Baptiste, two student ambassadors at the 
institute, helped tailor the program to UF’s campus and students.
“The main concern for young people in 
general is the pace of society,” said Jean-Baptiste, a 20-year-old UF English and anthropology junior. “It’s so much faster 
today than it was 20 to 30 years ago.”
Terlonge said media perpetuates the 
image of “the aggressive, hypermasculine 
man.”
“This program says ‘I can make it, and 
I don’t have to succumb to any ideas of failure, because I can be whatever it is I can be,’” said the 21-year-old UF art senior.

be April 11 and 12.IBC hosts Blueprint

UF has spoken against a bill that would end 
restrictions on ticket resales in Florida. The bill 
is aimed at paperless tickets, which require an identification or credit card to collect and are common at major sporting events.
The bill, sponsored by Rep. Jimmie Smith 
and supported by Fan Freedom, recently passed 7-6 in the House of Representative’s Business & Professional Regulation Subcom-mittee. From here, the bill could become law if the rest of the Florida House, the Florida Sen-ate and Gov. Rick Scott decide to pass it.
Mark Gajda, athletic association director 
for the University Athletics Association, was 
unable to comment on the bill because not all 
legislation that would affect ticket resale  had passed, saying that “any comments prior to fi-nalization of these bills could be speculation.”
The only illegal aspect of ticket resale at UF 
is scalping tickets on site, said University Po-lice spokesman Maj. Brad Barber.
“At present, you cannot resell a ticket at 
any price on the property where the venue is taking place without the prior consent of the owner of the property, which is the University 
of Florida,” Barber said.
He added that UPD enforces the rule. If 
UPD spots potential offenders, they first re-
ceive a warning, Barber said.
“If they’re encountered again, then they do 
face potential arrest,” he said.Gajda said that students caught scalping 
tickets won’t get arrested but instead sent be-fore Student Judicial Affairs to receive punish-ment.
UF students like Shivangi Patel said ticket 
resale is a convenient way to get rid of an oth-erwise unused ticket. 
The 19-year-old UF accounting sophomore 
said she uses Facebook to sell tickets when she can’t make an event.
“If you win the lottery and pay the $110, 
then you’re buying the tickets,” Patel said. “They’re yours. You should be able to do what you want with them.” UF opposes state bill that would allow resale of tickets

Keep business off 
social mediaWe suppose Twitter is, like, a real thing now because 
even companies are acknowledging it as a beneﬁ  cial tool.
“The Securities and Exchange Commission gave explicit 
permission for companies to use social media to announce key 
information, so long as investors have been alerted about which 
sites will be used to disseminate such disclosures,” The Wall Street Journal reported this week. 
That’s right: Important stock information can now be dis-
closed on Twitter, and it’ll count as an ofﬁ  cial announcement.
“The SEC’s report issued Tuesday conﬁ  rmed that fair-dis-
closure regulation that requires publicly traded companies to broadly disclose material information applies to social media sites like Facebook and Twitter the same way it applies to com-
pany websites,” according to the report.
Is this the age that we’re living in now — an age that just al-
lows a social media website with a 140-character limit make big 
announcements? A social media site, we might add, whose big-gest accounts get hacked for hours? Facebook is not any better.
We love Twitter, but it is not a place for serious business.“Most social media are perfectly suitable methods for com-
municating with investors, but not if the access is restricted or if investors don’t know that’s where they need to turn to get the 
latest news,” said George Canellos, acting director of the SEC’s 
Division of Enforcement, according to the Los Angeles Times.
But, dude, are social media sites really suitable methods? 
There is some terrible stuff on Twitter. Never look at the trend-ing topics because some of them are very stupid or very jarring.
Big, grown-up businesses should not use Twitter to make 
their ofﬁ  cial announcements. Twitter should be the place for links to news articles that discuss the ofﬁ  cial announcements’ news releases.
Twitter is not the place for investor announcements. How did 
the SEC come to this masterful conclusion? It probed a post by “Netﬂ  ix Inc. Chief Executive Reed Hastings on his personal Fa-cebook page stating that Netﬂ  ix’s monthly online viewing had exceeded one billion hours for the ﬁ  rst time. The company didn’t report this information to investors through a news release or SEC ﬁ  ling,” according to The Wall Street Journal’s article.
The day Hastings revealed that news, Netﬂ  ix’s shares jumped 
by 6.2 percent, according to the article. It was the only time Net-
ﬂ  ix had revealed that sort of information on a Facebook page, 
personal or private. The company also didn’t alert investors that the particular announcement would be made. Obviously, it re-sulted in higher shares.
According to the Los Angeles Times, “The SEC said it did not 
commence an enforcement action or accuse Hastings of wrong-doing because of the market uncertainty about the use of social media.”
Businesses should not use any social media site for grown-up 
reasons. That’s what news releases are for.Surprise! Politicians are self-interested
President Obama is creating a legacy — just not for the country’s future.
Obama is creating a legacy for himself. He wants to 
be remembered as an inspiring and transitional ﬁ  gure, and he’s going to make people pay damn attention to him.  
Obama has created a new group called Organizing for 
Action as a way to promote his policy agenda now and after he’s left ofﬁ  ce.
According to a McClatchy Newspapers article, however, 
some Democrats aren’t happy about the new organization and are wondering whether the president is “in it for him-self.” 
Indeed, the president’s new organization has no plans to 
“share money, resources or the priceless Obama email list 
with the Democratic National Committee or campaign com-
mittees that help elect members of Congress, governors or legislators,” the article states. 
Gilda Cobb Hunter, a South Carolina legislator and a 
member of the DNC, said in the article, “There’s only so much money to go around in Democratic circles. There’s a limited pool of resources. Why can’t we strengthen one en-tity?”
Let’s just keep in mind that Obama is not doing anything 
illegal or wrong here. In fact, he’s not doing anything that any other politicians in his position with vast, nearly unlim-ited resources would do.
The fact remains that most, if not all, politicians seek of-
ﬁ  ce for power and inﬂ  uence. Despite their campaign slo-gans, they don’t care about you, their district or the country at large.
I am always amazed when I hear people talk about 
greedy corporations run by selﬁ  sh, proﬁ  t-seeking individu-
als who only focus on making money. In fact, some think 
most wealthy people are just self-interested actors who look to increase their “shares” of the pot (even though wealth is not a zero-sum game, but that’s neither here nor there).
Yet, when these same wealthy businessmen, lawyers or 
career politicians enter public ofﬁ  ce, many people automati-cally assume they are in it for higher interests such as a sense of public duty or to help the needy.But as economist James M. 
Buchanan Jr. stressed, politi-cians are humans like the rest of us. We should not only be cyni-cal toward their motives, but we 
should automatically expect that 
they are in it for themselves.
How do the largest compa-
nies receive special favors from the government? Because gov-
ernment ofﬁ  cials are self-interested, well-connected to spe-cial interests and generally want to increase their purview of power, companies engage in “rent-seeking” behavior in which they attempt to curry these special favors and mo-
nopolistic rights.
Indeed, it is a growing state that fosters more rent-seek-
ing, lobbying, campaign contributions and attempts to inﬂ  u-
ence election outcomes that favor one company more than another.
These activities — and I cannot stress this enough — are 
not unique to one party or politician. President Obama is just as guilty as President Reagan. Senator Elizabeth Warren is just as guilty as Senator Marco Rubio. It is the nature of the 
beast that is the state and its various institutions.
Furthermore, one should also keep in mind that those at-
tempting to enter public ofﬁ  ce are seeking a position with 
vastly more power than even the largest corporation. Gov-ernments have the power to wage war, to force citizens to pay taxes, to put people in prison for disobeying arbitrary rules and regulations and even to determine who should live or die.
Anyone with humble or pure intentions would not dream 
of having such authority and control.
Obama’s display of self-interest in creating a legacy does 
not make him more or less human than any other politician. We are just fortunate enough to catch a glimpse of a politi-cian’s true nature.

A few weeks ago, my roommates and I went to din-
ner to complain about our endless weeks and the massive amount of homework we had to look for-
ward to.
While we were waiting to sit, we saw a young woman 
breastfeeding her child in the corner of the room, and I remember thinking how precious the moment was. It wasn’t long before a man approached the woman and asked her to stop the “inappropriate and disgusting be-havior.” I thought he was joking, considering she had a blanket covering her entire upper body while she was feeding the baby.
The man explained to her that he felt uncomfortable, 
especially in front of his 10-year-old son, and that she 
should feed her baby with a bottle in public.
For a while, I didn’t know what to say.
I was speechless. I was astonished by the man’s irratio-
nal behavior and his harsh tone toward the mother who, after all, was simply feeding her hungry baby. I think I stared for a while, with my jaw wide open in disbelief. Did this really happen? The woman quickly mumbled an apology, with a bright red face and eventually left the room. The man calmly took his seat again. There we 
were, my roommates, the man with his son and I, and the 
entire time, I couldn’t shake the feeling someone should say something.
Afterall, isn’t it every woman’s right to feed her child 
in public even if she is breastfeeding?
Unfortunately, I never had the chance to say anything 
to the man, as the hostess seated him soon after.
I still regret it. Maybe it wasn’t my place to interject, 
but I didn’t want him to think his behavior was accept-
able. Why did the man feel so uncomfortable in the situ-
ation to begin with?
The answer dawned on me one day while I was read-
ing about sexual citizenship in a book excerpt by Brenda Cossman, a professor at the University of Toronto.
She talked about the different sexual expectations 
men and women face in society, and how those who do not conform to these expectations risk alienation. She ar-gues good sexuality only exists in private spheres and 
bad sexuality in public.
Women are often expected to be very private sexually, 
while men are allowed to be more open.
Could it be the man perceived her breastfeeding as 
sexual? Maybe the fact that she was willing to expose her 
breast to her child under a blanket seemed unacceptable to him.
When I was younger, women rarely wore cover-up 
in public while breastfeeding. Today, however, it’s un-
heard of for a woman to expose her breast while feeding 
her child.
Instead, many women face discrimination for breast-
feeding and have opted to feed their child with a bottle to avoid rude remarks.
Recently, breastfeeding laws have swept the United 
States and the world to protect a mother’s right to feed her child while at work or in public.For example, the National 
Conference of State Legislatures lists the various laws in regard to breastfeeding in each state in the U.S. In 2010, President Obama 
signed the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act that requires employers to give em-
ployees a break to nurse a child until he or she is about 1 year old.
Some of the laws require some public locations to 
have labeled areas for breastfeeding and diaper chang-ing that are not in bathrooms.
Although these steps make it easier for women to feed 
their children, it seems crazy the government has to en-
force these rights.
Many people already criticize the government for be-
coming too involved in our personal life, but what if we 
can’t make these decisions on our own? Do we need our government to regulate what is considered sexual in our society and what is just human nurture?
In general, I think our society has become very desen-
sitized in regard to sexuality.
The idea that sex sells is very common in advertise-
ments, and shows like “Teen Mom” discuss sex very openly. Let’s not forget music lyrics that openly call women sluts and b----es and have little moral ground with regard to our sexuality.
Breasts are in most advertisements today anyway, so 
how is it suddenly indecent when they feed an infant?
In case people don’t remember, breasts are meant to 
do that job — not to sell fast-food burgers.
We worry so much about our reputation and our out-
side appearance in public, but what about how the public portrays us in the media? The “Killing Us Softly” vid-eos by Jean Kilbourne are in their fourth installment, but women are now, more than ever, objectified and sexual-ized in media.
Society has become so hypersexualized that it’s hard 
to tell the difference between what’s sexual and what’s not. People are afraid to discuss sex, but they will go home and research all their questions because they are 
afraid their sexuality is too public.
Women who are sexually experienced are called sluts, 
but we no longer wonder why advertisements use wom-
en to sexualize products.
I hope this debate about public breastfeeding won’t 
spiral out of control, and our government won’t interfere more.
I hope when I have children, I will be allowed to 
breastfeed them if I want to, and I won’t have to follow 
“The Rules of Nurture.”
I would like to dedicate my essay to the woman at 
the restaurant who was openly disrespected and judged. 
And to the man, who obviously had no manners what-soever, your behavior truly was inappropriate and dis-gusting.

Stop and think about it: We constantly use electric-
ity throughout our daily lives. Whether we are texting on our iPhones, watching TV or lighting 
our homes, energy is integral to our way of life.
When we flip a switch, we don’t think twice about 
how the lights turn on. So, where does all of this electric-
ity come from?
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administra-
tion, America’s top three sources of electricity in 2011 were coal, with 42 percent; natural gas, with 25 percent; and nu-clear, with 19 percent. Nuclear is the only of these sources that emits zero carbon. It is disheartening that more than 
half of our electricity generation is produced from fuels 
that have damaging effects on our climate. If we continue down this path, our children and their children will be left with a planet barely comparable to the one we inherited. It takes a long time to reverse the effects of carbon emis-sions. Our generation knows we need to begin to solve the problem. Nuclear power is a viable solution.
As engineering students, we see nuclear power as a 
way to contribute to society as professionals and as citi-zens. We welcome the challenge. We embrace it. It is our future.
What is so great about nuclear power? To start, nuclear 
power plants are a major step toward achieving zero car-bon emissions and reducing background radiation in the atmosphere. 
Obviously, nuclear plants 
emit less carbon into the air.  But you may not know that nuclear 
power plants that meet govern-
ment regulations release less radiation into the air than coal plants, wrote Alex Gabbard, a 
principal investigator for the Oak Ridge National Labora-tory’s nuclear energy program, in a report.
Additionally, nuclear fuel has a much higher energy 
density than fossil fuel. One uranium fuel pellet — about one-third the size of the average person’s smallest finger 
— will produce the same amount of electricity as one ton 
of coal. Opponents argue that nuclear energy produces nuclear waste. Remember, however, that these used nu-clear fuel pellets are extremely compact. These pellets are in solid form, so they are controllable and do not escape into the atmosphere.  
We cannot, however, control carbon dioxide after it 
is released into the atmosphere from fossil fuel power plants. Once carbon is released, there is nothing we can 
do to protect the environment or ourselves.
Remember, too, that the so-called nuclear waste is 
more like an untapped resource. According to the World 
Nuclear Association, more than 95 percent of used fuel from “nuclear waste” is made up of uranium that can be recycled and reused to generate electricity. 
Fossil fuels lack this quality. Other countries, such 
as France and Japan, have figured this out. They recycle and reuse their used nuclear fuel, using technology that 
America could use — yet we still do not recycle.
We cannot afford to use fossil fuels as our majority 
source of electricity. Although some other zero-emission energy sources, such as wind and solar powers, can be 
used in small quantities, they have low energy-density and are quite expensive. We cannot wait for them to be-come cost-effective before we deploy large quantities of zero-emission electricity from nuclear power.  We need to embrace nuclear energy now.
Expanding our use of nuclear power to generate elec-
tricity would ensure energy sustainability and, perhaps more important, maintain a clean and livable planet for 
generations to come.  The future engineers of our genera-
tion are ready to make this happen.

Jesus Najera was tired of seeing Facebook groups 
spammed with ads, so he decided to clean it up.
The 20-year-old UF finance graduate student is a 
co-founder of Market Loco, an online market that al-
lows college students to buy and sell products and services.
MarketLoco.com, which is specialized by univer-
sity, breaks the market down into categories of stu-dents’ interests: tickets, furniture, subleases and mis-cellaneous. The website’s free mobile app went live Friday.
UF, Florida State University, University of Mas-
sachusetts at Amherst, University of Michigan, Uni-versity of California at Los Angeles and University of Texas at Austin have branches on the website. A Florida Gulf Coast University page is in the works.
Najera said he saw how inefficient Facebook was 
as a college marketplace and wanted to streamline the process of buying and selling among students.
“Now you have a Facebook page with a vast 
amount of ridiculous posts from ‘looking for a sub-lease’ to ‘selling my left pinky,’” he said.
Najera said Facebook appeals only to the seller-
side, while Market Loco fuels the buyer-side by mak-ing shopping more simple and efficient.
Najera described himself as the business and mar-
keting side of the website. His two partners, Univer-sity of Michigan students David Fontenot and Raj Vir, handle the technical side.
To drive more traffic to the site, Najera created an 
ad featuring an unofficially signed message from Fa-cebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to stop spamming official Facebook groups for student exchanges and to use Market Loco to buy and sell things on campus.
While Zuckerberg didn’t officially endorse his web-
site, Najera believes that Zuckerberg is against group spamming.
The ad caught Abe Carryl’s eye while he browsed 
the UF Class of 2014 Facebook page two weeks ago.The 21-year-old UF information systems and opera-
tions management senior said he prefers Market Loco to Craigslist because of its proximity and how easy it 
is to use. He used the website to sell basketball tickets 
and plans to sell his old guitar.
“I’ve seen a lot of different markets like this, but 
none of them are very easy to use,” Carryl said.

Keith Gerber started breeding maggots 
a week ago to prepare for the BugFest. He 
hopes to have a couple hundred ready for 
maggot art.
The 20-year-old UF entomology sopho-
more and president of UF’s entomology 
club was preparing for today’s free open 
house hosted by the entomology depart-ment from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at Stein-
metz Hall, 970 Natural Area Drive.
The first 400 people will receive free 
pizza and tickets to the Butterfly Rainfor-
est at the Florida Museum of Natural His-
tory.
For maggot art, people will dip mag-
gots in paint and put them on paper to trace their paths.
There will also be cockroach races and 
cricket-spitting, a competition to see who can spit a cricket the farthest.
Gerber said the idea of BugFest is to re-
cruit high school and college students to the entomology department.
This year, BugFest will be seminar-style, 
with presentations every 10-15 minutes.
“Insects are a daily part of your life, no 
matter what you try to do about it,” Ger-ber said.
The entomology club’s secretary, Jade 
Hilliard, said the highlight of this year’s Mardi Gras-themed event will be the ar-
thropod petting zoo, which will consist of 
a tarantula, a scorpion, Madagascar hiss-ing roaches, crickets and a giant African millipede.
“This year, we’ve actually gotten a lot 
of insects instead of just our typical taran-tulas or roaches,” said the 21-year-old UF entomology senior. “Now we have mantis and beetles and things like that, so we’ve 
expanded our little zoo.”Tarantula, scorpion available for petting at BugFest today

Beginning July 1, the standards to qualify for the Bright Fu-
tures scholarships will become more strict. 
They will take effect on the high school class of 2014; how-
ever, the University of South Florida’s analysis obtained by the 
Florida College Access Network looked at how the changes 
would affect current recipients if they were held to the same 
standards.
About 60 percent of Hispanic students and about 75 percent 
of black students currently eligible for Bright Futures would no longer qualify if held to the new standards. By comparison, about 40 percent of white students and 40 percent of Asian stu-dents who have a Bright Futures scholarship would not be eli-gible, according to the analysis.
Students will need to score an 1170 on the SAT or a 26 on the 
ACT. The current standards require a 1020 or 22.
Kate Pivacek, a UF 20-year-old journalism sophomore, said 
students stay in state because they have Bright Futures, but re-ceiving the funds is more difficult, she said.
According to the analysis, about 87 percent of Hispanic fresh-
men met the current standards, but about 35 percent would 
qualify after July 1. About 2,700 black freshmen met minimum 
criteria for Bright Futures for Fall 2012; however, 650 would meet the minimum criteria set for Fall 2014.
“Those standardized tests aren’t a good indicator for who 
deserves scholarships,” said Ciara Lepanto, a 19-year-old UF English sophomore.
UF would see between 65 percent and 90 percent of its stu-
dents still qualifying, compared with other Florida schools, which would have less than 25 percent of their freshman eli-
gible for Bright Futures, according to the analysis.

◗ BLISTERING AND 
PERMANENT SCARRING ARE EFFECTS OF BLACK HENNA.
CAITLIN RADDATZ

Think twice about getting a black 
henna tattoo because it may not be 
temporary after all.
The U.S. Food and Drug Admin-
istration warns that people have 
reported severe reactions, such as 
blistering, loss of skin pigmentation and permanent scarring, to henna tattoos.Some reactions, which may oc-
cur immediately after or weeks after getting inked, have caused some people to seek medical care.
Traditional henna is made from 
a flowering plant. It has a reddish-brown color and has been used for centuries to dye skin, fingernails and wool.  
In the last decade, henna has 
been used recreationally, said Ta-mara Ward, an FDA press officer.
Black henna is different from tra-
ditional henna. Though the ingredi-ents, either a mixture of henna and other elements or simply hair dye, are used to create darker and longer-lasting tattoos, the FDA said it’s “po-
tentially harmful.”
“With black henna tattoos, we’ve 
been made aware that they’re using 
coal-tar hair dye,” Ward said.  
Coal-tar hair dye contains p-
phenylenediamine, which can cause severe skin reactions.  A tattoo artist may use a PPD-containing hair dye alone.
“By law, PPD is not permitted 
in cosmetics intended to be applied to the skin,” according to an FDA report.  “While states have jurisdic-tion over professional practices such as tattooing and cosmetology, that oversight differs from state to state. Some states have laws and regula-
tions for temporary tattooing, while 
others don’t.”
In Florida, black henna tattoos 
are legal, said Molly Kellogg, a press secretary for the Florida Department of Health.
She said she doesn’t believe 
there’s legislation about black henna tattoos.
Joe Altizer, manager of Inked 
Tattoo, 1410 NW 13th St., said the shop offers “the all-natural, brown-red henna,” but it’s not something his staff does often.
“I wouldn’t do henna that’s not 
naturally derived,” he said. “I think that’s the first mistake people are 
making.”
Before getting any kind of tattoo, 
he suggests people research.  
“The more education you have, 
the better decisions you make,” he 
said.
To his knowledge, there is no ac-
creditation for henna.
Raevon Rolle, an 18-year-old UF 
public relations freshman, is not a stranger to henna tattoos. She got her first one, which lasted a week, in high school.
Now, Rolle said, she always asks 
to make sure artists don’t use black henna on her skin.
FDA warns of severe reactions to black henna tattoos“Those standardized tests aren’t a good 
indicator for who deserves scholarships.”

The Santa Fe College Spring Arts 
Festival will offer alcohol for the ﬁ  rst 
time at its 44th annual event this weekend.
Event organizer Kathryn Lehman 
said participants will be able to buy several types of beer and wine at two small areas at the festival, which will be Saturday and Sunday downtown at Northeast First Street and the Thomas Center lawn. 
The festival will sell alcohol at 
the event to put the money raised toward scholarships offered to Santa Fe College students, Lehman said.
“It’s an opportunity to help, as 
funding issues have changed,” she said. “That’s our eye on the prize.”Serving alcohol at outdoor events 
on public property goes against a city 
ordinance, so special approval from 
the Gainesville City Commission was required to do so.
City Commissioner Lauren Poe 
said it’s not uncommon for organizers of large outdoor events to request an exception to the ordinance.
The purpose of the process, 
he said, is to check the outdoor 
environment where the alcohol will 
be offered.
“Large events are a bit unusual, 
so that’s why we tend to consider it 
on a case-by-case basis,” Poe said. 
“We want to make sure it’s still 
family friendly.”
City staff is drafting ordinances 
that would change the outdoor 
alcohol sales ordinance to make 
the special events permits process 
easier.

Four percent of American college graduates 
wish they had more sex while they were in col-
lege.
That’s nothing compared to the 48 percent 
who wish they had studied more, according to 
a poll published Monday by “60 Minutes” and 
Vanity Fair.
Amanda Whitaker, a 19-year-old UF busi-
ness administration freshman, said she thinks studying should be a top priority, but many students don’t exert their full energy.
“You’re paying for school,” she said. “It 
needs to be important, and you need to spend a lot of time on it.”
The poll also reported that about 40 percent 
of American college graduates wish they net-worked more while in college.
“I would say that [networking] is critical,” 
said Ann Christiano, a UF public relations pro-fessor. “I see a tremendous difference in terms of job placement between students who have built those networks while they are in college and students who have not.”
The poll, which was conducted at the “CBS 
News” interviewing facility, randomly sam-pled 861 adults nationwide by phone from March 1-3.
In addition, the poll found that 68 percent of 
college graduates could not name the current president of their alma mater, and 86 percent of Americans don’t care if a friend or colleague was a member of a fraternity or sorority in col-lege.
“A lot of people don’t care about campus pol-
itics,” Brent Smith, a 28-year-old UF alumnus, said. “Once people leave their college, they’re not that ﬁ  nancially or emotionally invested in the actual academia of that institution.”Grads reflect on college in poll

Junior center Patric Young (4) attempts a shot during Florida’s 79-59 loss to Michigan in the Elite Eight on Sunday at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas.
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Writer
ARLINGTON, Texas — When asked after Flori-
da’s Elite Eight loss to Michigan on Sunday whether 
he would return to UF for his senior season or bolt to the NBA, center Patric Young was noncommittal. 
“I’m just going to talk to my family and do what-
ever makes me happiest,” Young said. “We’ll see from there. … If I decide to come back, I’m going to work my butt off and make sure we can have another spectacular season.”  
Even if Young decided to forgo his senior year and 
declare for the NBA Draft, Florida would still boast a deep roster heading into 2013-14. 
UF loses seniors Kenny Boynton, Erik Murphy 
and Mike Rosario — three starters who accounted for 
50.5 percent of Florida’s offense in 2012-13 — but will 
add five-star recruits Chris Walker and Kasey Hill. Dorian Finney-Smith and Damontre Harris will also be eligible after sitting out a season per NCAA trans-fer rules. 
Walker, a 6-foot-9 forward, adds length and ath-
leticism to UF’s frontcourt. The 6-foot-1, 160-pound Hill compensates for his lack of size with his quick-ness and ability to distribute the ball. 
“Kasey Hill, I think, is clearly one of the best point 
guards in the country,” Donovan said on Nov. 14, the day both players signed with Florida. “He’s explosive. He’s really good in transition. In our style of play — pick-and-roll, pressing — he’s going to be terrific. 
“[Walker is] long. He’s athletic. He’s quick. I think 
his offense needs to get better. I don’t think he’s there offensively, but he’s got a really good motor.” 
Added Young: “They’re supposed to be highly 
touted guys, but they’ll have to earn their spots.”
As a 6-foot-8 slasher, Finney-Smith is an efficient 
rebounder on the wing. In one season at Virginia Tech, he averaged 6.3 points and seven rebounds. He joined the Hokies as a top-40 recruit and started 30 of 33 games. 
Harris, a 6-foot-10 center, started all but one game 
during his sophomore season at South Carolina. He averaged 6.8 points and 5.5 boards per contest in 2011-12. Harris tallied 71 blocks — ranking second in the Southeastern Conference behind Kentucky’s An-thony Davis. 
“[Finney-Smith] can have a huge impact because 
he’s such a mismatch on the floor with his size and his Junior center unsure of return to Florida

For half an inning, an errant 
throw appeared to have turned 
a game-saving play into a game-changing blunder. 
UCF’s JoMarcus Woods hit a 
sharp ground ball up the middle with a runner on second, two outs and the score tied 2-2 in the seventh. Shortstop Cody Dent 
made a diving stop to prevent 
a single that likely would have scored Knights base runner Tom-
my Williams from second. But an 
ill-advised throw from Dent that skipped past first baseman Vick-ash Ramjit allowed Williams to 
score anyway.
Florida erased the error with 
two two-out runs in the bottom 
of the inning. The Gators (14-16) 
extend-
ed their 
winning 
streak to 
three games with a 5-3 victory Tuesday night at McKethan Sta-dium. The win gives Florida a season sweep against UCF (18-12).
“We have had struggles in the 
past, especially with two outs,” Taylor Gushue said. “To get those three runs with two outs tonight was huge for us. It was a good step in the right direction for our team.”
An error by Knights third 
baseman Chris Taladay and a wild pitch by right-hander Spen-cer Davis scored the tying and go-ahead runs for the Gators. Freshman Harrison Bader added an insurance run on a fielder’s choice in the eighth. Seven of nine UF starters registered a hit.
Gushue helped Florida nix a 
two-run deficit in the sixth. The catcher drove in Casey Turgeon from second on a single to left Gators top

The Gators have decided to ditch the tra-
ditional spring game in favor of what is es-
sentially an open practice. 
Because Florida has only six offensive 
linemen available, coach Will Muschamp plans to incorporate individual work and seven-on-seven drills during Saturday’s 
spring game at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
“It’s not fair to go in a spring game situa-
tion and ask [the offensive linemen] to take 
60, 70 snaps in a row,” Muschamp said. “That’s not healthy. It’s not good. It’s not good for our football team.” 
Guard Jon Halapio (knee) and tackle 
Chaz Green (ankle) will both miss the game 
after undergoing explor-
atory procedures in Janu-ary. Tackle Ian Silberman 
is out with a shoulder in-
jury, and tackle Trip Thur-man underwent surgery on Monday to repair a torn 
labrum. Guard Jessamen 
Dunker is indefinitely sus-
pended as he faces charges of felony grand theft auto and misdemeanor driving with a suspended license. Guard Max Garcia, now healthy, has 
battled back issues during the spring, and tackle Quinteze Williams was listed at de-fensive tackle last season.  
“It’s very disappointing,” tackle D.J. 
Humphries said of the offensive line in-
juries. “But everybody will be back in the 
summer. Everybody will be back and ready, healthy for the season, so it’ll be cool.”
As a result of the offensive line attrition, 
Saturday’s spring game will have just four periods of about eight-to-12 snaps of 11-on-11 scrimmaging. Muschamp said those pe-riods “will be normal football, as you watch Injuries force adjustment to UF’s spring game

“It’s embarrassing. I fell off my scooter. I was hoping you 
wouldn’t ask that.” 
Kyle Christy, UF punter  
on how he injured his shoulder
agility and his ability to shoot and 
finish on the post,” Young said.
“He can really help us out, as 
well as [Harris] with his shot block-ing. [Harris is] getting a lot better 
offensively. They just both have re-
ally good attitudes, so they’ll defi-nitely contribute to the team.”
Finney-Smith has three years of 
eligibility; Harris has two. 
Casey Prather, Will Yeguete 
and Scottie Wilbekin will return for their senior seasons.
Prather and Yeguete, who com-
bined for 22.1 percent of Florida’s rebounding this season, could see increased minutes and vie for start-ing jobs.
Florida’s underclassmen might 
also see increased roles — especial-ly All-SEC Freshman Team member Michael Frazier II, who averaged 5.6 points and 3.1 rebounds in 18 minutes off the bench this season. 
After playing mostly during 
the final minutes of routs this year, freshmen Braxton Ogbueze, DeVon Walker and Dillon Graham are ex-pected to fight for roles in the rota-tion. 
Boynton was somber after his fi-
nal collegiate game Sunday but had a positive outlook for the 2013-14 Gators.
“I think they’ll be right back in 
the same position next year,” he said. on a Saturday afternoon.”
Between segments, the Gators will run 
individual and position group drills for 
kicks, punts, red zone, offensive line, de-fensive line and pass rush, among others. 
“It’s gong to be a great day to go out 
and compete in front of people, have a lit-tle crowd noise, replicate what we’re go-ing to have to deal with in the upcoming season,” tight end Colin Thompson said. 
After 15 closed practices, the spring 
game is usually something of a payoff for the players. Not having it is a disappoint-ment, but being able to practice in front of fans still provides added motivation. 
“You do all those practices pretty much 
in the quiet, it gets you,” defensive line-man Damien Jacobs said.
“You’re trying to find something to mo-
tivate you every day, so when you get a 
couple people out there on Saturday, it’s 
definitely going to motivate you. I wish it was kind of like last year when we had the 
whole game, but it still should be pretty 
fun.”
To accommodate fans expecting to see a 
traditional spring game, UF made admis-sion free to the public. Muschamp and his 
assistants will also wear microphones to 
keep fans up to speed with the different drills. 
Muschamp said the new format will 
keep the Gators from doing as much third-
down work as he would have liked. Still, 
Saturday will be another opportunity to pit the offensive and defensive first teams against each other.
“I’m comfortable with this,” Muschamp 
said. “I really am. This is no different than if we would have a scrimmage. And to me, it’s about getting good-on-good work.”
Injuries: Defensive end Jonathan Bullard will miss Saturday’s spring game due to a 
hamstring injury. 
Cornerbacks Cody Riggs (hamstring) 
and Jeremy Brown (groin) are day to day, 
Muschamp said. 
Position changes: After being listed atop 
the depth chart at cornerback entering spring, Jaylen Watkins will start the fall as a safety, Muschamp said. 
With Loucheiz Purifoy and Marcus 
Maye playing well at corner, Muschamp said the move gives Watkins a better op-
portunity for playing time. 
Darrin Kitchens will play inside line-
backer in the fall. He entered spring play-
ing the Sam linebacker position.

Sophomore catcher Taylor Gushue throws the ball back to the mound during warmups between 
innings in Florida’s 4-0 victory against Ole Miss on Sunday at McKethan Stadium. The Boca Raton native finished 1 for 4 with an RBI, a stolen base and a run scored in the Gators’ 5-3 win against the Knights on Tuesday night in Gainesville.

a mismatch, 
Young saysSophomore catcher makes key slide on steal, scores tying run
field. Gushue then slid around an 
attempted tag from second baseman Austin Johnston with Justin Shafer at the plate for his third stolen base 
this season. Gushue scored on a 
two-out double off the left-field wall 
from Ramjit.
“It was pretty big,” Ramjit said 
of Gushue’s steal. “I’m sure [coach 
Kevin O’Sullivan] put that on and 
knew they were probably going to 
throw me off-speed, and Gushue got a good break and made a good slide. It worked out. Just being ag-
gressive that’s what we have to do 
as a team.”
Left-hander Daniel Gibson con-
tinued the bullpen’s effective work. 
He tossed a career-high 4.1 score-
less innings in relief of freshman 
starter Tucker Simpson, who didn’t 
last past the second frame. Gibson shook off early-season command issues with his fourth straight score-
less outing.
“For us, it was down to that point 
in the game where we didn’t want 
it to get away from us,” O’Sullivan said.
“We thought that was probably going to be the most important point of the game, even though it was five outs in. We were in a situation where we can’t be messing around.”
Right-handers Ryan Harris and 
Johnny Magliozzi pitched the fi-nal three frames. The latter earned his sixth save. Dating back to a 2-1 loss to Florida State on March 26, the bullpen has allowed two earned runs in 23.2 innings. O’Sullivan went to Gibson with Florida down two in the second inning.
Florida travels to Starkville, 
Miss., for a weekend series against No. 18 Mississippi State starting Fri-day night.
In a season with few highs, the 
Gators were at their lowest follow-ing their sixth straight loss on March 1 against Miami, Gushue said. The sophomore catcher said there’s a changed vibe with the recent suc-cess. 
“Those late-inning rallies with 
two outs are a big help for us,” right-hander Harris said.
“A big confidence booster for our 
hitters to be able to do the job with 
two outs, and pitchers love it. Pitch-
ers love when we get those runs.”

Sydney Moss enjoys nothing more 
than ruining the day of opposing play-
ers and fans, something she has made a habit of doing during the Gators’ run to the Final Four of the WNIT. 
The freshman guard is averaging 
19.5 points per game — best on the team — during Florida’s four wins. Included during that span is a career-high 28-point performance to help Flor-ida survive a first-round matchup with Florida International.
But Moss especially relished her op-
portunity against James Madison. 
Dealing with a raucous environment 
and a persistent group of hecklers, she scored a game-high 27 points during Florida’s 85-80 victory. 
The win propelled the Gators into 
the WNIT semifinals for the first time since 2000. 
“It’s really exciting going to some-
one else’s court and hearing the fans 
silent,” Moss said. 
“JMU kind of had a huge fan base. 
Just hearing them after we won — the 
buzzer going off — just silence. The only thing you could hear really was our fans doing the Gator chomp.”
Coach Amanda Butler has looked to 
instill aggression in Moss throughout the season. 
Moss showed glimpses of her poten-
tial during the regular season, notching double-doubles against North Carolina State, Vanderbilt and South Carolina. 
But she failed to play with confi-
dence and consistency until the Gators 
reached the postseason. 
“She’s matured a ton, and she’s 
learning a ton,” Butler said. “That pro-
cess is certainly not over, but I think there has been a tremendous gap in where she started mentally and what she expected of herself and what she knew about herself as a competitor to where she’s at now.”
Moss’ on-court demeanor has shift-
ed noticeably. Rather than settling for jumpers or disappearing for stretches, she has consistently influenced the outcome of games on both ends of the floor. 
In addition to leading the team in 
scoring, Moss has  grabbed 8.8 rebounds per contest during the WNIT run. 
“She is definitely the MVP for this 
tournament so far,” senior Jennifer George said. “She’s been so consistent 
with her scoring and her defense. I have 
just been so impressed.” 
The Gators (22-14) will need Moss to continue playing at a high level as Flori-da travels to Philadelphia to face Drexel (26-10) on Wednesday at 7 p.m. in the Daskalakis Athletic Center.
“A very tough matchup for us,” But-
ler said. “It is one of those teams that when you watch them on film, you go: ‘Oh, gosh.’ They pose a lot of different challenges. … We’re definitely going to have our hands full.”

Coach Tim Walton does not announce probable 
starting pitchers before each game. But if he did, 
Hannah Rogers’ name would appear more often than 
not.
Since Florida defeated Alabama 8-4 on March 6, 
Rogers has gotten the ball 11 times in the Gators’ 16 
games. 
The junior right-hander has logged 70 percent of 
Florida’s innings in Southeastern Conference play.  
Rogers says her arm does not get tired, but after 
pitching in all but two games during the past three-and-a-half weeks, anyone’s arm would feel fatigued. 
The reason Walton keeps putting the junior out on 
the circle is obvious — she is clearly No. 3 Florida’s (35-3, 10-2 SEC) best pitcher. She leads the team with a 1.12 ERA — 0.66 points better than any of her fellow 
UF hurlers.
In SEC play, the difference 
between Rogers and the rest of 
the staff is even more drastic. 
Her ERA is 0.84. The next 
closest is Lauren Haeger, who has an ERA of 3.68.
Florida has an .833 winning percentage in SEC 
play, so Walton’s strategy has worked so far. But the Gators still have another 18 games on the schedule.
Rogers leads the staff in every statistical category, 
but the other pitchers have not had a chance to prove themselves, especially during conference play.
Haeger has only three starts against SEC oppo-
nents. 
One was a 7.2-inning outing in a 3-1 loss to No. 6 
Tennessee on March 16. She gave up three runs and was saddled with the loss. 
Sophomore Alyssa Bache has seen even less time 
in the circle. She has pitched just 5.1 innings in confer-ence play, including four in Florida’s 8-7 win against Ole Miss on Sunday. 
Before getting the ball on Sunday, she had pitched 
only 2.1 innings of relief since March 8. When Bache finally got to start, she was shaky with her command but pitched four scoreless innings until steady rain robbed her of her grip and footing.
Walton’s squad is a serious contender to win the 
SEC Tournament and make a deep run into the Wom-en’s College World Series. But to do so, the Gators need Rogers at full strength.
