on Sunday night for the upcoming International Quidditch World Cup in New York City. 
  � THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE 
TEAM HAS MADE IT TO THE TOURNAMENT.

  From a distance, the cluster of UF 
students practicing at the center of Flavet Field Sunday night might have looked like an ordinary sports team.
  But upon closer examination, the 
details were different. Players rode on PVC pipes, running, leaping and dodging balls under the moonlight. 
  They weren’t playing soccer or 
football. 
They were playing Quidditch.  The meeting was one of the UF 
students’ last practices before travel-ing to New York to compete in the In-ternational Quidditch Association’s fifth-annual World Cup for the first time.
  “This is a sport,” said team presi-
dent Bridget Siegel. “It’s ‘Harry Pot-ter,’ but it’s a sport.”
Non-magical Quidditch, inspired 
by J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter fran-chise, is a mixture of rugby, lacrosse and dodgeball without any padding, said Siegel, a 19-year-old religious studies sophomore.  
  Seven athletes from each team 
play one of four positions at a time. There are four balls and six hoops, and all players except the snitch run-ner must keep a broomstick between their legs. 
Florida Quidditch players use 
PVC pipes for broomsticks during practice. 
For the competition on Saturday 
and Sunday, about 2,000 athletes from 100 teams will gather on Randall’s Island in New York City to vie for a trophy, 14 handcrafted broomsticks and the title of best Quidditch team in the world.

  Despite entertainment changes, turnout for 
this year’s Gator Growl was lower than ex-
pected.
  The UF student-run pep rally, put on by 
Florida Blue Key, attracted a crowd of about 26,000 this year, said Gator Growl Producer Aaron Heger. Staff had projected more than 30,000 people would attend.
  Final attendance numbers were not avail-
able at press time, but Heger said about 11,000 students attended, which he estimated is about 2,000 more than last year.
  This year the stage was moved from the 
north endzone to the student section of Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium, ﬁ  reworks were brought back after a two-year hiatus, and a headlining music act returned after a year without one.From what he has heard, Heger said the stage change has generated the most positive feed-back. 
  “It’s just much easier to see from mul-
tiple angles across the stadium,” he said.Heger said the return of ﬁ  re-
works and the “Ask Bernie” skit were also received well. In the skit, UF President Ber-nie Machen did “the Bernie,” a dance from the 1989 movie “Weekend at Bernie’s.”
  Audience members also 
enjoyed this year’s entertainment, Heger said. Joel McHale, who hosts “The Soup” on E! En-tertainment network and acts in NBC’s show Gator Growl turnout came up 
short despite show changes � THE DRIVER WAS CITED

  A UF employee was taken to 
Shands at the University of Flori-
da after he was hit by an RTS bus Monday afternoon.
  Ayman Abdellatief, 31, was 
riding his bike south on Gale Lemerand Drive around 3 p.m. when he was hit by an RTS Route 121 bus as it turned into the Large Commuter Parking Lot, accord-ing to a University Police Depart-ment news release.
The bus, driven by 51-year-old 
Craig Pearson, was also traveling in the southbound lane when the accident happened, the release said  
  Maj. Brad Barber, public infor-
mation ofﬁ  cer for UPD, said Ab-dellatief was pinned under the bus for several minutes before police ofﬁ  cers and Gainesville Fire Rescue workers were able to pull him out.
  Abdellatief was taken to 
Shands with arm injuries, Bar-ber said. However, Barber said he did not know how severe the injuries were.
Abdellatief’s status was not 
available as of press time.
  “The bicyclist is very fortunate 
to have survived this incident,” Barber said.
  Pearson was cited for careless 
driving.  Bicyclist struck by RTS

Memorial service to be held for 
former professor
Friends and family will 
gather at M. Jack Ohanian’s me-
morial service on Saturday to honor the former associate dean for research and administration and a professor of nuclear engi-neering at UF.
Ohanian, who retired in 
2001, died Oct. 31. He was 78. His family has not released the cause of death. 
His friends said he was pas-
sionate about nuclear engineer -
ing. 
He was active in showing the 
need for the country to use nu-clear power in light of various oil problems, said Gene Hemp, who knew Ohanian for 40 years through working together in the nuclear engineering depart-ment at UF.
When not devoting his time 
to work, Ohanian traveled to other countries, mainly in Eu-rope, and spent time with his wife in their timeshare in Fort Myers.
The memorial service will 
be Saturday at 2 p.m. at Grace Presbyterian Church, 3146 NW 13th St.

Flamingo spotted on a lake 
north of NYC
POUND RIDGE, N.Y.  — It 
wasn’t a lawn ornament on a 
suburban New York lake. It was a real pink flamingo.
According to the New York 
Post, Chris Evers spotted it last month while canoeing on Lake Kitchawan near his Pound Ridge home.
Concerned the tropical bird 
would die in the cold overnight, he brought it home and placed it in a water-filled bathtub.
An ID band on the bird’s leg 
showed it had been hatched at an exotic-animal business in North Carolina.
The flamingo’s owner was 
quickly contacted. He’s a pri-vate zoo operator who lives 15 miles from Evers and has a state permit to keep a flock of flamin-goes. The bird had been miss-ing for two days after flying the coop on Oct. 22.

J. Robert Cade, the inventor of 
Gatorade, died Nov. 27, 2007, at the 
age of 80. 
According to the UF directory, 
he can be reached at 352-392-8592. His email address is also listed. 
Professor Gerald Kish died in 
September after suffering a heart attack. But he is no longer listed. 
Students, faculty and identi-
fication coordinators in each de-partment can update the directory themselves, said Warren Curry, the manager of identity access manage-ment at UF. However, some people do not publish their information, and it doesn’t get updated. 
Students can update their ad-
dresses by accessing myUFL and changing their directory profile. 
The information is stored in the 
identity registry, Curry said. 
For a professor or student who 
has passed away, their information is marked with a deceased flag. The Office of Human Resources Servic-es must flag for a UF employee, and the Dean of Students Office must flag for a UF student.
“It can sometimes take a few 
days,” Curry said. “We have to be careful with that transaction.”
However, the information on 
the deceased does not get deleted. It remains on the registry hidden from the public view. 
The online directory updates 
at least once a day from the main source registry. Some cases can be updated within an hour, Curry said. 
Unlike the online directory, the 
UF printed directory gets updated every year. 
James S. Evans is a directory 
systems operator at UF. He notices that every year the UF directory is printed with incorrect informa-tion, including the information of deceased people. It makes his job tougher. 
In last year’s directory, there 
were 3,337 people listed without phone numbers, 1,900 people listed with incorrect phone numbers and 11 deceased people listed, Evans said.
“I was told by my supervisor 
that a few mistakes in the directory is nothing to complain about,” he said.Names of deceased still 
appear in UF directoryWASHINGTON — Sorry, E.T. lovers — 
the White House says it has no evidence 
that extraterrestrials exist.
The White House made the unusual 
declaration in response to a feature on its website that allows people to submit pe-titions that administration officials must respond to if enough people sign on.
In this case, about 5,000 people signed a 
petition demanding that the White House disclose the government’s knowledge of extraterrestrial beings, and about 12,000 signed another petition seeking formal acknowledgement of an extraterrestrial presence engaging the human race.
In response, Phil Larson of the White 
House Office of Science and Technology Policy wrote that the U.S. government has no evidence that life exists outside Earth, or that an extraterrestrial presence has contacted any member of the human race.
“In addition, there is no credible infor -
mation to suggest that any evidence is be-ing hidden from the public’s eye,” Larson wrote.
But he didn’t close the door entirely 
on a close encounter of an alien kind, not-ing that many scientists and mathemati-cians believe that, statistically speaking, odds are high that there is life somewhere among the “trillions and trillions of stars in the universe” — although odds of mak-ing contact with non-humans are remote.
It’s not the first petition to force the 
White House to engage on a somewhat off-beat topic since the “We the People” website was unveiled in September. The White House also has been forced to ex-plain why it can’t comment in response to a petition demanding “Try Casey An-thony in Federal Court for Lying to the FBI 
Investigators” (because it’s a law enforcement 
matter).
And various peti-
tions demanding legal-ization of marijuana have gathered about 100,000 names, to which the White House argues 
that marijuana is associated with addic-tion, respiratory disease and cognitive im-pairment, and legalizing it would not be the answer.
When the website debuted, the White 
House promised to respond to any peti-tion that garnered 5,000 or more signa-tures within 30 days, but it’s now raised that threshold to 25,000.

Using social media to meet new people is a growing trend among 20- and 30-somethings. Apps like OkCupid Locals and Blendr let young adults set up instant dates. 
ASHLEY HEMMY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Snagging a date for Friday night can be as 
easy as checking your phone. 
A growing trend of smartphone applications 
are being used by 20- and 30-somethings to set 
up instant dates. 
Users upload photos, interests and their loca-
tions. Some choose to text and chat online with others for a few weeks before meeting, while some meet each other right away.
Some apps, like OkCupid Locals, are part of 
larger dating websites, while others, like Blendr, are solely apps. 
The creators of Blendr, which unites people 
with common interests, also launched Grindr, an app launched in 2009 and that’s popular among gay men.
Unlike ordinary dating websites, Blendr and 
Grindr use location-based networks, allowing users to view the profiles of other app users who are nearby . 
Initially offered only on the iPhone, Grindr is 
now also available on most Blackberry models. In November, the app surpassed 3 million users in 192 countries with 814,000 U.S. users, accord-ing to a Nov. 3 Grindr news release.
Jesse Scanlon, a digital media technology 
junior at Santa Fe College, has friends who use Grindr and said it is a better alternative to OkCu-pid Locals, the app he uses.
Scanlon said he has made friends and set up 
successful dates with the OkCupid app.
“Only a few years ago, people would make 
swift judgment or criticism toward the idea of digital dating,” Scanlon said, “but today , it seems more than feasible, in my opinion.”
Ilan Shrira, an assistant UF psychology pro-
fessor, said college-aged students tend not to use dating websites because they have large social networks.
This growing trend of using social media to 
meet new people can erase previous stigmas to-ward dating sites for young people who say they don‘t need them. 
“Young people in college are using a combi-
nation of both chatting online and meeting face-to-face,” he said. “If anything, an app would help them.”
Other ways young people meet online are 
through Facebook, Twitter and other networking sites, he said.
Freshman Alissa Giordani, 18, said she has 
not used dating websites or smartphone apps, but said she sees how other college-aged people may be interested.
“Apps seem to make the other person more 
real,” she said. “You can text them on your phone instead of just talking to them online.”Dating apps for smartphones gain popularity among some students� THE PLAYERS WILL SPORT UPD-
APPROVED BANDANAS PAID FOR BY STUDENT GOVERNMENT.

Nerf darts will fly, and the zombies 
will multiply when the Humans vs. 
Zombies game returns to campus — this time sporting new, Student Government-funded accessories.
The 24-hour-a-day campus-wide game 
of tag begins at midnight Wednesday and ends Sunday night.
A group of people wearing bandanas 
on their arms and carrying balled-up socks and Nerf guns act as humans who ward off zombies. The zombies, who wear bandanas on their heads, tag the humans to turn them into zombies.
Players must wear the designated 
orange and blue Humans vs. Zombies bandanas during the game. The 1,600 bandanas were bought over the summer and paid for by SG, which gave the club $3,600, according to Rebecca Foster, Hu-mans vs. Zombies chapter president. 
“We negotiated with the police to use 
bandanas instead of T-shirts,” said game moderator Anthony Cardona, a 19-year-old exploratory liberal arts sophomore.
Bandanas are distributed to players at 
the rules meetings. The final rules meet-ing will be held in Rinker Hall Room 110 today at 8 p.m. 
Participants must attend a rules meet-
ing, receive a waiver and check out a bandana before they play.
Players must return the bandanas by 
Sunday or they will be fined, Cardona said.  
As of Monday evening, there were 182 
people registered for the game. About 1,100 people participated in the largest Humans vs. Zombies game at UF held in spring 2010.Humans vs. Zombies returns

Days after local law enforcement 
agencies teamed up to investigate 
three robberies, an anonymous tip and a probation bracelet led to the arrest of two men who now face ex-tradition from Georgia. 
Michael T. Spralding, 24, and 
Henry L. Murray, 31, were arrested Saturday in Hapeville, Ga., in con-nection with two of the crimes, ac-cording to a joint news release from the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office and Gainesville Police Department. 
GPD detectives received an 
anonymous tip that the men might be connected to the crimes, said Cpl. Angelina Valuri, GPD public information officer.
Murray was wearing a GPS 
tracking bracelet because he is on felony probation in Florida. The bracelet helped law enforcement officials find them, said Sgt. Todd Kelly, ASO public information of-ficer. The agencies got arrest warrants 
for the men and worked with Geor -
gia authorities to bring them into 
custody, he said.
One of the 
home invasions occurred on Sept. 6, when an el-derly couple was tied up in their home on North-west 49th Lane 
and had their white Ford Explorer and other items stolen.The second set of charges is re-
lated to a Nov. 2 robbery in which a woman was tied up in her home on Northwest 38th Street and had her white Subaru Legacy stolen. 
Both of the cars have been 
found.
They face an extradition hear -
ing in Georgia before they can be brought to Alachua County, Kelly said. 
ASO and GPD are continuing 
to work together on the home in-vasion investigation because they believe there is at least one more suspect at large, Kelly said. 
No one has been charged in the 
first home invasion robbery, which occurred on June 27 at a home on Northwest 45th Avenue.
Spralding and Murray have 
been charged with two counts each of home invasion robbery with a firearm and false imprisonment and one count each of aggravated battery on a person 65 years or old-er, larceny and grand theft, accord-ing to the news release.

to enter, the UF club team, 
ranked third in Florida, has been planning to go since last November. 
Thirty-one people — 21 
athletes plus coaches and supporters — spent about $10,000 out-of-pocket to fund the trip.
During the World Cup’s 
randomly generated pool stage, the team will play the University of Ottawa, the State University of New York at Geneseo and the Delaware Valley Dragons.
 Arizona State University 
will be the team’s fiercest competitor. 
If UF makes the top three, 
the players will progress to the bracket stage.
Chaser coach and crimi-
nology sophomore Nick Wright, 19, said he thinks the team could go far in the com-petition.
“I expect our style of play 
to be completely new to those big northern teams,” Wright said. “We have a lot of stam-ina and a lot of speed, and we’re just going to run the big teams into the ground.”
About 30 players tried out for the 21 spots on the World Cup team in August. 
Since then, they have been 
increasingly trading fun prac-tices for agility drills, suicide sprints and intense scrim-mages, Wright said.
This training has helped 
the team move together more fluidly, said Hannah Pohl-mann, 19, the club’s vice pres-ident of tournaments. 
The team has improved 
significantly so she expects it to progress to the bracket stage.
“We have been practicing 
extensively, and we’ve been playing more consistently than any other team in Flori-da,” said Pohlmann, a math-ematics sophomore.
Regardless of outcome, the 
entire team is excited for the World Cup atmosphere. 
Siegel said Quidditch al-
lows players to bond whether they are from Gainesville or New Zealand. 
Good sportsmanship is a 
key part of Quidditch, as is making new friends. 
“There’s some sort of weird 
joy that comes from Quid-ditch, just because it is based on something that is fictional, which is fun.” Pohlmann said. “It’s fun to be silly.”“Community,” performed as the 
Gator Growl comedian. The Goo Goo Dolls played as the headlin-ing band.
Heger said a 1,500-student sur -
vey conducted in the spring indi-cated that 90 percent of respon-dents wanted a music act at Gator Growl.   
Bringing the Goo Goo Dolls 
cost $110,000 and bringing McHale cost $85,000, Heger said. Student Government transferred $71,000 from reserve funds to Stu-dent Government Productions in September for Gator Growl to put toward the Goo Goo Dolls.
Gator Growl Public Relations 
Director Cait Feroleto estimated that Gator Growl expenses totaled around $1 million.
Kaitlyn Hosticka, a 23-year-
old criminology junior, said she had never heard of McHale before Gator Growl staff announced he would be the comedian.
She said McHale turned out to be her favorite part of the show. She particularly enjoyed his jokes about the Kardashian family and about the University of Georgia. 
Hosticka said the Goo Goo 
Dolls were good, but she was in-terested in seeing more recent acts like Maroon 5, LMFAO or Lupe Fiasco.
She posted her thoughts on 
Twitter on Friday night: “Joel McHale was the best part! Goo Goo Dolls are great, but next year they need a more current per -
former.” TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 5

Let Them Pray
Voluntary service 
outside school OK
In our Oct. 24 issue, we sided with an atheist Rhode Island 
student who claimed that her school was violating the First Amendment’s establishment clause. In the school, 
a mural depicting a prayer hung on the wall and was titled “School Prayer.” It was also Christian in nature, clearly vio-lating the establishment clause of the Constitution. 
Closer to home, the Clay County School Board recently 
told a local pastor that his traditional morning prayer service was unconstitutional. 
Ron Baker, the pastor of Russell Baptist Church in Green 
Cove Springs, holds voluntary prayer services at the flag-poles outside of various elementary schools in the area, one of which he has been coming to for 12 years. 
The school’s district attorney, J. Bruce Bickner, opined that 
these services constituted a “clear violation of the establish-ment clause and a clear case of endorsement of religion gener-ally and Christianity particularly.”  
He also said that it is unconstitutional “for a teacher, 
school administrator or other school district employee to join in a prayer session during their work time.” Bickner has been encouraging Baker to move his services to before 7:10 a.m., when teachers usually arrive to school. 
In this situation, Bickner shows a blatant lack of under-
standing about the establishment clause. In the previously discussed case of the Rhode Island school, the mural indicates that the prayer itself is connected to the school and therefore creates the appearance that the school is respecting a particu-lar religion. 
In the case at hand, the Florida school has neither endorsed 
nor tried to restrict Baker from coming to a school to conduct a voluntary prayer service for teachers and students. Bickner’s interpretation that the reach of the First Amendment’s “estab-lishment clause” prohibits public employees from engaging in religious practices during their work time is way too broad and completely off-base. 
The establishment clause, in relation to school prayer, 
should only prevent teachers or administrators from respect-ing beliefs or leading students in prayer. Otherwise, all out-side voluntary associations do not violate the Constitution. 
For instance, if a Muslim teacher needs to observe prayers 
throughout the day, his or her participation in religiously required prayer rituals violates neither the rights of her stu-dents nor the First Amendment. 
Public employees should not have to give up their person-
al religious freedom when they walk through the door. 
In its simplest interpretation, the purpose of the First 
Amendment was to prevent state-sponsored religion as well as religious persecution. Holding a voluntary prayer service at the flagpole in front of the school does neither of the above. 
Bickner and the Clay County School Board should worry 
about more important matters than infringing upon volun-tary associations.My mom has worked in Hallmark stores for as long 
as I can remember. By this point, I’ve learned al-most as much about the company as she has.
The work can be fun with all the cute gifts and hilarious 
cards. However, you can also come home covered in glitter and smelling like the new, terrible candle scents that are in season. There are noise-making cards and any number of figurines that could break at any moment. As with any job, it has its ups and downs.
But do you recall the most famous downside of all?Every holiday is ruined months beforehand.In Hallmark world, Christmas really does start in July . 
Stores start selling tree ornaments early , which means they received the ornament shipments even earlier than that. 
It’s the worst. Anyone who works there doesn’t get to 
complain on Nov. 1, like the rest of us, about Christmas com-mercials starting already. No one whines about when to start playing Christmas songs, because they’ve already been play-ing them for months. 
Lights around your house all year long?  Hallmark back-
rooms have the same problem, so no judgment here.
Don’t get me wrong, I love the entire holiday season: sip-
ping eggnog, looking at bright lights on houses, watching Claymation specials on TV . It’s delightful, truly . But not for Hallmark employees. They don’t get to enjoy any holiday season, ever.
I guarantee you there are boxes of Valentine’s Day cards 
already in the storerooms of most Hallmark stores.
Some may say holidays are perpetuated or created by the 
greeting card industry . But let me tell you, they’re not happy about it. Don’t blame card and candy companies for keeping holidays alive, because at this point, they find no enjoyment in them. Holidays are simply a means to an end.
There are always new events for holidays to promote, 
which take up quality time during actual holiday week-ends.
Then again, the stores should be grateful for those big holidays. Between e-cards and the current American apathy , I don’t see a good future for most greet-ing card stores. Of course, it’s just ingrained in all of us to buy a card for the gift we’re giving, but how can that sustain so many different stores? It probably can’t.
Hate the greeting card com-
panies? Fine. Think holidays are 
silly? Some of them are, sure.
But both of those things are a part of American culture. 
We just can’t let them die out so easily. We need them to re-mind us of those holidays. Without them, we’d be stuck with those sad Publix commercials, and I won’t have that.
Not only are those Publix commercials way too sad, but 
grocery stores are much more necessary than greeting cards — they’re in no danger of being eliminated.
Every once in a while, I’ll wonder why McDonald’s or 
Coca-Cola still run commercials and advertisements. Who hasn’t heard of them by now? Everyone knows those major companies exist. But people might forget about their local greeting card store, right? Those are the ones that need to be pushing for more customers in any way possible.
Even though Hallmark isn’t a “mom and pop” shop, the 
people who run them are moms and pops. And, just like other season-driven businesses, they rely on the public to re-member and depend on them at the right time.
All companies have their faults, sorry. It’s going to hap-
pen in an imperfect, capitalist economy . Maybe Hallmark isn’t as “green” as you would like or as hip and happening. But you’re not going to find a cool greeting card store.
So suck it up and tell someone that you’re thinking about 
them with a puppy sitting in a boot while you listen to Mi-chael Buble’s new Christmas album. It’s the American way.

Is there a future for the Greek people, the 
Greek government and the Greek na-tion? There is no time for daydreaming 
or guessing, or for nightmarish scenarios or for wishful thinking. The present ailing sys-tem needs be dismantled and restructured on new foundations.
The primary budget surplus that many 
Greeks are hoping for will prove impossible to achieve if the hugely inflated Greek debt bubble is not completely removed from Greek society. Behavior does not change by handing out orders or an attitude of slan-dering. The only thing that will help change the way of thinking is a slow but effective realization that development has lacked bal-ance and stands precariously on a bubble.
The Greek bubble includes, surrounds 
and defines every “modern-era” Greek citi-zen. It intensifies social injustice and the re-sulting social inequality.
This bubble has skyrocketed consumer -
ism but with no productive results. Success and prosperity increased mainly as a result of corruption, illegal transactions, tax eva-sion, the  granting of privileges to certain workers and union, and the embezzlement of state and Social Security funds. Fraudu-lent acts brought wealth to many Greeks, regardless of industry.It is indisputable that those bubbles are a 
political issue and thus need to be resolved by politicians. Action should be taken, and decisions should be made. However, that is not an easy task.
For many years, inequality has existed in 
Greece. Political leaders have been giving benefits to wealthy, powerful and well-con-nected citizens at the cost of indigent citi-zens, unemployed citizens and pensioners. This has to change, and if it does not, the debt will never resolve.
Greek politicians fail to acknowledge the 
issues at hand. In a press conference three days ago, Evangelos Venizelos, the coun-try’s Minister of Finance, claimed the “sac-rifices [of] the Greek people have paid off.”
“These harsh measures are the country’s 
ticket towards alleviation of the national debt,” he continued.
I cannot help but dissent. These sacrific-
es have not yet paid off, and we still do not know if Greece will be alleviated of its huge debt. Such ear-caressing political statements are cliche and outdated, and Greek citizens are fed up with them. We are trying to get rid of this bubble. Such statements may have been effective in the past in mild situations, but now the country is on fire. Today’s re-ality demands political acts, self-criticism and clear messages that will support and unify the nation. Greek 
politicians should finally consider acting like how they are supposed to act: like lead-ers.
No one can say for sure to what extent 
the crisis will affect us or how long it will continue to harass the Greek population. Greeks have lived for the past 20 years in a state of fictitious security. Now, they are asked to jump into a state of controlled bankruptcy.
The whole nation has had to radically 
change its rhythm of life, mentality and ev-eryday habits and continue living in a new society where everything will be completely different. Greeks need visible and radical political action that will bring more just changes to the lives of every citizen.
“Absolute poverty is not the problem in 
our societies. In the developed world, we are not in need of more wealth but of more justice,” said British epidemiologist Rich-ard Wilkinson, who studied the relation between inequality and social problems in more than 20 countries, including Greece.
In an interview with a Greek newspaper, Wilkinson said “equality must come about as a result of free choice.”
“The citizens must understand that the 
more social equality exists in a society, the better life quality will exist in all levels of that society,” he said. “It is a matter of soci-etal education.”
So what would the benefits be? Better 
physical and mental health, longer life ex-pectancy, better education, lower crime and drug-use rate, more social trust and greater involvement in community acts.
Recession may aggravate inequality, but 
it may also take the edge off it. Let’s look at the previous economic crisis of the 1930s: The British government passed laws that dropped the price of goods at a faster rate than that of salaries. Therefore, inequality was very much limited as people could buy more with less money.
Although it is risky to compare the re-
cession of the 1930s with that of the mod-ern day, we can reach one conclusion: Some Greek citizens are paying the price, and some others are refusing to pay the cost of the crisis. The crisis that they brought to the Greek nation. That is the bubble.

Kim Kardashian is famous for a lot of reasons that so-
ciety would hate to admit, but on Aug. 20, the world had an American wedding that could challenge the 
royal wedding in terms of importance to People Magazine.
On that day, society took great hope, because as bad at 
basketball and, seemingly, at life as Kris Humphries was, he could get with someone like Kim Kardashian. As many people continue to wonder what happened, we are left to speculate on what crashed this couple.
Kardashian is one of those people like Paris Hilton or 
Joe the Plumber — it is hard to describe why they’re still famous. Her claim to fame ranges from being the daughter of a guy on O.J. Simpson’s defense team to having a public relationship with Brandy’s brother.
Kardashian’s staying power has centered on dating a 
number of athletes, including Miles Austin. The E! Enter-tainment network has shown “Keeping up with the Kar -
dashians” over the last five years. The show centered on her family and is possibly the worst television experience since “Deal or No Deal.” At least “Deal or No Deal” didn’t have spinoffs for Kardashian to appear on.
Kris Humphries is an NBA player. Devoting any more space to him is a tragedy while the NBA is locked out but is necessary to fully understand this divorce.
Humphries played one season at 
the University of Minnesota and then 
was drafted by the Utah Jazz in 2004. After several mediocre NBA seasons, he ended up in New Jersey. This past season, Humphries averaged a career high, averaging a  double-double for the New Jersey Nets.
Humphries’ success can largely be attributed to playing 
on a terrible team and having Deron Williams, one of the NBA’s best point guards,  feed him the ball.
The couple’s marriage had obvious signs of failure. First, 
Kardashian was too intelligent for Humphries. If you believe America’s education system does not risk leaving people be-hind, you have not heard Humphries speak.
Kardashian is attacked for being illegitimately famous 
but demonstrates her intelligence in interviews, displaying an advanced knowledge of legal proceedings and business concepts. If there’s something to gain from this marriage, it’s finding out how we could produce someone like  Humphries in America.In reality, Humphries was probably the first casualty of 
the NBA lockout. Humphries should have been spending September and October preparing for the NBA season but instead had a ton of free time. 
Kardashian was an independent woman who, for all of 
her discussions on wanting to find love and get married, traveled the country promoting her brand.
In the brief time they dated, Kardashian probably enjoyed 
the few moments she got to spend with Humphries, but as those moments turned into weeks and those weeks turned into more than a month, Kardashian took decisive action.
Kardashian was not about to wait around like the NBA 
and the players union toward an inevitable 50/50 split; she was going to take everything Humphries had given her and walk.
Before we jump to criticize the couple, maybe we should 
stop to ask ourselves why they get the attention they do. We’re almost as much to blame as they are for this little me-dia circus.

Police searching for a 2-year-old 
Washington state boy focused their 
efforts Monday around the home of his mother, who reportedly told investigators she last saw him in her stalled car on a city street as she walked away for an hour to get gas.
It wouldn’t be the first time Sky 
Metalwala had been left alone in a car. When he was just 3 months old, court records revealed, his parents left him in their sport utility vehicle in a Target parking lot for 55 min-utes on a 27-degree day . They only came out of the store to get him after police arrived and asked for the ve-hicle’s owner to be paged.
The toddler’s disappearance 
Sunday in Bellevue, a city of 122,000 across Lake Washington from Se-attle, came at the height of a cus-tody fight between his parents, Julia Biryukova and Solomon Metalwala. They separated in March 2010 amid back-and-forth protective orders and allegations of abuse and psychi-atric problems.
Last December, a social worker 
determined that there was a “pre-ponderance of evidence” that Met-alwala had struck his daughter hard enough to cause bruising, court re-cords show. The social worker also said Sky had troubling bruises, but because the boy could not talk, it wasn’t clear where he got them.
Last week, at a mandatory medi-
ation session, a tentative agreement was hammered out that would al-low Metalwala to have some visita-tion with Sky and his older sister, his lawyer said.
Biryukova reported that her car 
ran out of gas in Bellevue on Sunday morning, police said. She said she left Sky in the unlocked vehicle and walked with her daughter, who is 4, about a mile to a gas station. When she returned to the car, Sky wasn’t there, she said.
Investigators searched a 20-block 
area and even went door to door but found no sign of him. There was no gas can at the car, police said.
The Bellevue Police Department 
said both parents were cooperating, and Biryukova had consented to have her vehicle and home in nearby Redmond searched. The older child is in protective custody.
“We’re looking at it from all 
angles, at this point,” said Bellevue Police Maj. Mike Johnson. “Missing person, abduction, foul play has not been ruled out.”
Biryukova did not immediately 
return a call seeking comment. Her younger brother, Stanley Biryukov , said Julia cried frantically when she called him Sunday afternoon and explained what had happened.
“I’m hoping they’ll find the 
child,” he said.
Metalwala spoke with reporters 
at the office of his lawyer, Leslie Clay Terry III. They said his estranged wife’s story was bizarre: Why didn’t she call for help, knock on a nearby door or take the child with her?
“I don’t understand why she 
would leave a little baby in the car,” Metalwala said.
In December 2009, Redmond po-
lice cited both parents for reckless endangerment at the Target parking lot. A shopper who heard the baby crying in the SUV called police, and a responding officer reported that the car felt cold.
Paged inside the store, the couple 
said they had left the baby in the car for 15 to 20 minutes because they didn’t want to wake him up. Sur -
veillance video of the parking lot later proved it had been 55 minutes.
The case was dismissed early this 
year after the pair completed a year of probation, 40 hours of communi-ty service and a 10-week parenting class.
The couple had been together for 
14 years. He was 21 and she was a high school sophomore when they began dating, according to one of her court declarations. In another declaration, her mother, Nadia Biryukova, wrote that they married in 2003 in her kitchen just before he was to be deported to Pakistan.
In court documents filed in con-nection with their divorce, Julia Biryukova said their relationship de-teriorated in 2008 after they bought an expensive home in Kirkland and couldn’t keep up with the payments on that property and a condomini-um they also owned.
CPS received six referrals about 
the family from late 2009 to late 2010, state officials reported in court documents.8, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2011

UF now offers a magazine that caters to 
the Asian community.
Sparks Magazine, UF’s only Asian-inter -
est publication, will hold its release party to-
day on the second floor of the Reitz Union by the auditorium. 
Magazines will be distributed after the 
screening of the 2006 film “The Namesake” at 5:30 p.m.
The magazine aims to inspire members of 
the Asian-American community and provide insight about Asian culture in Gainesville. 
“I’ve always felt that magazines were a 
powerful way to communicate with soci-ety,” said Kevina Lee, the magazine’s editor-in-chief. 
Maureen Mariano, co-managing editor 
of the magazine, said she hopes the release brings support and publicity.
“I want people to see the message behind this first issue,” said Mariano, a 20-year-old journalism sophomore.
The release is in collaboration with UF’s 
Asian Kaleidoscope Month, which is dedi-cated to celebrating Asian history, culture and contributions.
Before Sparks Magazine was created, the 
Asian community at UF had a magazine, but it was geared toward literary writing. 
Lee, a 21-year-old journalism junior, 
wanted to get involved, but the publication shut down before she could do so.
After being involved with the Asian 
American Student Union organization at UF, she decided she wanted to revive the cultural aspect of the magazine but with a different vision.
“I wanted to make a brand new magazine, 
incorporating more journalism and more of a reason for people to read it,” she said.
Linda Son, the magazine’s creative di-
rector and a 20-year-old telecommunication junior, wants the magazine to be a constant source of information and hopes it can be a long-lasting voice on the UF campus.
The magazine also has a website, sparks-
mag.com, which is updated regularly.Students to celebrate release

Next fall, veterans receiving medi-
cal treatment in Gainesville will have a 
free place to stay. 
At the Gainesville Fisher House, 
veterans, members of the military and their families will be able to stay for free when receiving treatment from a military medical center. 
The  Fisher House is currently in 
its planning and fundraising stages. It will be located next to the Malcom Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Cen-ter and across from Shands at UF on Archer Road.
“The Gainesville Fisher House will 
be a comfort home where military vet-erans and their families can stay for longer durations,” said Patti Fabiani, executive director of the Gainesville Fisher House. There are 56 Fisher Houses nationwide.
The Malcom Randall VA Medical 
Center currently serves 50 counties that are home to about 120,000 veter -
ans and military members,  Fabiani said. This Fisher House location would 
potentially have 20 fleets, which are rooms outfitted for families. Anywhere from 20 to 60 people could stay in the house at one time.
Fundraising goals need to be 
reached before the opening of the house. It will cost about $6 million to build, and the organization’s goal is to raise $3 million, which will be matched by the Fisher House Foundation. 
In an effort to help 
raise funds, the Fish-er House will be host-ing a 5K on Veterans Day.
Brandon Davis, 
the campus recruit-ment chair for the Fisher House, origi-
nally planned the 5K as a philanthrop-ic event for the Agricultural Economics Club, part of the Food and Resource Economics Department at UF. 
The 5K is open to all participants 
who register online at active.com.
If all goes well, the Gainesville Fish-
er House should be up and running by next fall, said Davis.Organization plans to build

Tyler: University of South Carolina Presi-
dent Harris Pastides said Sunday that the SEC will expand to a nine-game con-
ference schedule starting next season. SEC of-ficials, for their part, went all “nothing to see here” and said they had not even discussed changing the current eight-game format.
This would be all well and good, except 
Pastides’ comments were well thought out, certainly not incoherent thoughts spewing from a crazy southern gentleman’s skull. Pas-tides said one of three previously scheduled nonconference opponents (Wofford, East Car -
olina or UAB) would not play South Carolina next season. If the Gamecocks lost money by going back on their word, the SEC promised to cover it, Pastides said.
Regardless of how many conference games 
will be played next season, the SEC has at least considered expanding the season. Or Pastides is playing a weird joke — seems un-likely for someone who works at an institute of higher learning.
Adding a ninth 
conference game makes more sense because, if for no other reason, Gators fans are guaranteed at least one more quality opponent each year. Florida would have to drop one of four nonconference games next season, probably against Jacksonville State or Louisiana-Lafayette, to make room for an SEC West team.
Matt: I disagree with expanding the 
conference schedule to nine games, and,  
like all things related to college football these days, it’s all about the money . 
Adding an extra 
conference game to the schedule is a logistical problem, first of all. The SEC signed a 15-year, $2.25 billion con-tract with ESPN in 2009 and another 
with CBS for 15 years and $825 million. 
Who knows if exceptions were built into 
those contracts to expand the pay rate for an-other SEC game? Or will the SEC simply have to bite the bullet and give the networks a game under the current money agreement? 
Then, you also have to factor in the ac-
tual market value of the conference’s deal on the current landscape. Those contracts run through 2023 — smart for the networks, may-be not so smart for the SEC. 
The Pac-12 signed a 12-year, $2.7 billion 
deal in May, already making the SEC’s con-tract undervalued. Now, they’re talking about adding more value in the form of another game.
Supposedly, the SEC and ESPN agreed 
for “look-ins” — periodic evaluations of the contract — throughout the deal, but the latest from the Worldwide Leader isn’t so promis-ing: “They don’t reopen the deal. There’s no outs,” said Burke Magnus, a senior vice presi-dent of college sports programming in June. 
Tyler: If the SEC wants to reopen the con-
tract, ESPN will play ball. The SEC is the best conference, and ESPN can’t afford to lose it.
The conference wants its own network like 
that of the Big Ten, which will be generating

Quarterback John Brantley sat out the final nine minutes of UF’s win 
against Vanderbilt on Saturday after suffering an injury to his arm. 
� HE LEFT VANDY GAME IN FOURTH 
QUARTER WITH INJURY TO RIGHT ARM.
TOM GREEN
Alligator Staff Writer
Florida redshirt senior quarterback John Brant-
ley was held out of practice Monday after injuring 
his right arm against Vanderbilt.
Coach Will Muschamp said Brantley’s injury is 
“nothing serious,” and that he expects the signal-caller to return to practice today and be ready to start against South Carolina this weekend.
Brantley suffered the injury late in the fourth 
quarter of Saturday’s 26-21 win and sat out the end of the game while freshman Jacoby Brissett took over the offense. 
After the game, Brantley walked off the field 
with his bicep wrapped in ice.
Brantley said he hasn’t thrown since late in 
Saturday’s game, when he tossed some warm-up passes on the sideline before the coaches and train-ers decided it would be best for him to sit out the final minutes.
“It feels better,” Brantley said. “Took a good 
shot on it and right now it’s just bruised up, noth-ing more than that.”
As for Brantley’s right ankle, which he sprained 
just before halftime against Alabama on Oct. 1, the quarterback said he is inching closer to being 100 percent, but was sporting an air cast Monday. 
Although his mobility is still limited, he and 
Muschamp said the quarterback will “possibly” be able to take snaps from under center at some point this week.
“Whenever we feel that I can do that at 100 per -
cent, we will,” Brantley said.
Pistol here to stay: After Florida unveiled its 
version of the pistol formation against Vanderbilt, Muschamp said the Gators will continue to use the set to establish a downhill rushing attack.Brantley expected to play at South Carolina

The Gators have never been more ready to 
forget about the Southeastern Conference.
No. 23 Florida (16-7, 7-4 SEC) will look to 
put a disappointing stretch of SEC games in the 
rearview mirror as it prepares this week for the opening round of the NCAA Tournament.
“I’m just happy to get out of the league right 
now,” coach Becky Burleigh said.
The Gators experienced unprecedented strug-
gles within the SEC during the last three weeks.
Prior to this season, Flori-
da had never lost more than 
three games within the conference in school his-tory.  The Gators surpassed that total by losing to LSU and South Carolina at home to end the season, their first ever back-to-back home SEC losses.
After defeating Georgia and Alabama in the 
first two rounds of the conference tournament last week, Florida fell 3-2 to a seventh-seeded Auburn team it defeated during the regular sea-son. 
Burleigh said having the opportunity to play 
an opponent outside the conference will give her team a fresh start.
“For our players it’s going to be nice to be out 
of the SEC in terms of not playing somebody that Gators looking 
to move past SEC struggles

UF awarded No. 2 seed, favorable draw in NCAA tournament
knows us so well,” Burleigh said. “That 
whole second half of the season where everybody knows every single player on every single team is a little bit of a grind.”
The SEC’s presence in the NCAA 
Tournament is greater than ever, with a record eight teams making the field.
“We’re battle tested,” said Burleigh, 
referring to the quality of the SEC.
Florida learned Monday afternoon 
that it received a No. 2 seed and will play host to the Atlantic Sun Conference champion Florida Gulf Coast on Satur -
day in the opening round of the tourna-ment.
The Gators defeated the Eagles on 
Sept. 11, 5-0, but Burleigh said that win does not have any bearing on Saturday’s 
match.
“We don’t get any 
extra points for having beat them earlier in the year,” she said.
Although Burleigh 
said the Gators’ previ-ous win is irrelevant, she said she likes hav-
ing game tape to review.  
While the Gators have had incon-
sistencies on both offense and defense throughout the season, Burleigh said the team sees the tournament as a chance at a fresh slate.
She also believes the experiences of 
the up-and-down season will serve them well going forward.
“We have done a lot of things that 
have helped to prepare us,” she said. “We’ve played in a lot of pressure situa-tions.  We’ve played from behind. We’ve been able to dominate games.
“Those things make us better in the 
long run, but now it’s time to put all of those things together and execute.”SOCCER , from page 13

The SEC added Texas A&M and Mis-
souri to bolster the future SEC Network. Really, the expansion was about picking up the St. Louis, Kansas City and Texas TV markets.
More eyeballs tied to the conference 
will be good for the future SEC Network, as will more conference games.
Matt: I agree that the expansion was 
mainly about picking up the lucrative markets you mentioned, but I’m not sold on the prospects of an SEC Network or the SEC’s sway over ESPN and their contract. 
ESPN has extended its reach. They’re 
not as reliant on the SEC as you might think. Still, there are more money issues to this schedule expansion talk than just TV deals. 
If Florida had to play another confer -
ence game during this year’s regular sea-son, the Gators, among other SEC under -
achievers, would be in serious jeopardy of making it to a bowl game.
Instead of a gimme win against 
Furman in two weeks, Florida could be playing Texas A&M or Arkansas. 
Think about that.The Gator Bowl, a likely destination 
for Florida, generated $2.75 million in revenue for each team last season.
That’s a serious windfall to miss out 
on. 
Tyler: Without a nine-game sched-
ule, however, the SEC is flawed. Start-ing next season, Florida will play six games against East teams. That leaves two games against the West: One against LSU every year and one against another team.
If the SEC goes with home-and-home 
rules against that second West team, it will take UF about 10 years to play every conference team in the regular season.
Under the current rules, Florida fans 
will be waiting too long to see teams like Alabama, Arkansas and Auburn. Add-ing an extra conference game will make these quality matchups more frequent.
Matt: The SEC will say this is good 
for the fans, but what it comes down to, truly, is the conference’s bottom line. 
Playing an extra game does more 
harm to the SEC than good, unless your name is on that new, assumably much larger check.

The formation worked well against Van-
derbilt, as the Gators rushed for 197 yards and 
three touchdowns, including a career-high 158 yards from Jeff Demps, who was named the Southeastern Conference Offensive Player of the Week on Monday.
While Florida found plenty of success with the set Saturday, Muschamp said he still pre-fers a traditional I-formation offense.
“That’s when you keep defenses off bal-
ance,” Muschamp said. 
“Being able to be effective in running the 
ball and the play-actions off of it ... are better from under center.”
Injuries: Aside from Brantley’s injury, 
Muschamp updated the status of several other Gators on Monday. Cornerback Jeremy Brown (knee) is the only player listed as out for the South Carolina game.
Muschamp said linebackers Jelani Jenkins 
(undisclosed) and Lerentee McCray (shoul-der) returned to practice Monday after miss-ing the Vanderbilt game. 
Running back Chris Rainey (right ankle), 
right tackle Chaz Green (right ankle) and left guard Dan Wenger (undisclosed) are expected to participate in practice today.
Freshman guard Tommy Jordan had 
shoulder surgery Monday and will miss the remainder of the season and take a redshirt. He joins fellow freshman offensive lineman Trip Thurman, who had season-ending shoul-der surgery earlier in the year.

Headed into her fifth season as the Gators’ 
coach, Amanda Butler admits that due to the 
changing nature of the game, there are no uni-versal solutions to her past obstacles. 
“Each year ... is so different,” she said. “We 
certainly have learned and grown — myself included, my staff — and we’re just excited to have this group of seniors.”
This season’s senior class, led by center 
Azania Stewart, holds special significance.
When Butler took over in Gainesville prior 
to the 2007-08 campaign, Stewart was among the first players she brought into the program.
“(Butler’s) energy is out of this world,” 
Stewart said. “If you don’t match it and you don’t come to her expectations, then you get left behind.”
Butler’s 78 wins at UF mark the best four-
year total in school history, and she is also the first Gators women’s basketball coach to lead her squad to a postseason berth in each of her first four seasons.
However, Butler is just 7-20 against ranked 
opponents at Florida and has advanced to the NCAA Tournament only once.
The senior class boasts five members while 
the Gators return 10 players overall from last year’s squad.
With that experience in tow, Butler has been 
impressed by her squad’s “sense of urgency.”
“They are defining — by the way they play 
— what Florida basketball means on the wom-en’s side,” Butler said.
Since taking over as the Gators’ coach, But-
ler has tried to change the definition of Florida women’s basketball.
While Butler has shown signs of improve-
ment as a coach, redshirt senior Jordan Jones says that it’s important for the players to reciprocate their coach’s support for them.
“I really do respect her 
a lot — not just as a coach, but as a person,” Jones said. “That’s important: to play for a coach you respect a 
lot.”
Butler’s main strategy to return to the NCAA 
Tournament is simple: win more games.
Improving their total in the win column 
will start with Friday’s season opener against Michigan at 4:30 p.m. in the O’Connell Center.
“We just want to put ourselves in a position 
where people aren’t making decisions for us,” Butler said. “We want to be in control of our own destiny.”Butler, UF looking to future

Florida freshman defensive specialist Holly Pole earned the 
ﬁ  rst start of her career Sunday against Ole Miss.
  BRYAN HOLT
 Alligator Writer
 
  Chloe Mann and Holly Pole are different players. 
  Standing 6-foot-1, Mann has become a dominant middle 
blocker for Florida, playing as high above the net as any Gators middle has in years, according to UF coach Mary Wise.
  At 5-foot-8, Pole is a cheerful defensive specialist who has 
recently earned extended playing time due to her performance in practice.
  But past the obvious contrasts, the two are similar.  “Chloe and I are deﬁ  nitely really close,” Pole said. “We 
played together (on club team) Gainesville Juniors. We played against each other in high school. It’s deﬁ  nitely cool that we both get to start because we have a lot of the same friends that come to the games.”
  Mann and Pole grew up in Gainesville and Ocala, respec-
tively. They brieﬂ  y played club volleyball with one another. For both, volleyball was just part of a two-sport regimen in high school.
  Mann got started with volleyball when she was looking for 
a sport to play outside of tennis season. For Pole, volleyball was a fall sport to supplement her Vanguard High basketball team, which she led to the 2010 FHSAA Final Four.
  “When you have good athletes, they get those volleyball 
skills, they get the experience and then you get them playing at their best,” Wise said. “We felt that both had a high ceiling, and we’re seeing 
them move in that direction now.”
  Recently , the two have improved enough to gain starting 
spots and extended playing time. 
For the past three games, Mann, a sophomore, has started 
in place of senior Cassandra Anderson. On Sunday against Ole Miss, Pole, a freshman, got her ﬁ  rst career start and re-sponded by recording seven digs and helping turn around the Gators’ passing game.
  “(It’s) not so much experimental as much as both Holly 
and Chloe have been playing well,” Wise said. “I wanted to give them a chance.”
  The moves meant Anderson and freshman defensive spe-
cialist Madison Monserez sat out during the weekend for the ﬁ  rst time all season. 
  “If we struggled, I wouldn’t have hesitated to put either of 
those two — Maddy or Cassandra, who have more playing experience — in those positions,” Wise said.
  However, the two locals have not struggled. Mann led the 
team in points with 20, picking up eight kills and six blocks in Sunday’s game. 
  “It’s nice to play in front of a lot of people that we know 
and see some familiar faces out there in the crowd,” Mann said. “It’s deﬁ  nitely nice.”  Pole, Mann earning more playing time

  Joanna Mather didn’t walk away from the 
USTA/ITA National Indoor Championships 
this weekend with the collegiate grand slam title she was so close to capturing.
  Instead, the UF tennis senior fell to Southern 
Methodist’s Marta Lesniak in a 7-5, 6-1 defeat in the tournament’s ﬁ  nals in Flushing, N.Y.
  But even with a fall season-ending loss, 
Mather’s play during the weekend was noth-ing for the Gators to be disappointed with.
  “She did an amazing job, frankly ,” UF 
coach Roland Thornqvist said. 
“Obviously she played at a very high level, 
but I think mentally that was the best I’ve seen Jo. She was very calm. She was resilient. She was conﬁ  dent.”
  Mather worked her way 
through a competitive round of 32 to face off against 10th-ranked Lesniak, who pre-viously downed Florida’s 
Lauren Embree in the tour-
nament’s round of 16.
  In Sunday’s ﬁ  nals, Mather jumped out with 
a 5-2 ﬁ  rst-set lead, but Lesniak soon pulled away by wearing Mather thin with hard shots deep into the corners to win in straight sets.
  Despite the loss, Thornqvist sees plenty of 
positives for Mather heading into the spring season, which picks up again in January.
  “She did a really good job playing it point-
by-point,” Thornqvist said. “Whether we played a good one or we played a bad one, she had great composure and bounced back and played the next point like it was the ﬁ  rst one of the match.” Despite loss, 
Mather’s play impresses
