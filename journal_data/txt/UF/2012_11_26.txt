 TALLAHASSEE — The atmosphere on 
Saturday night in the bowels of Doak Camp-
bell Stadium was bittersweet. Florida’s fate 
was in another team’s hands, but coach Will 
Muschamp — soaked and dripping with 
Gatorade — still found plenty to be happy 
about.
  Only one year removed from questioning 
the Gators’ toughness, Muschamp watched his team play the 13th-ranked Seminoles off 
their own ﬁ  eld.
  “It was a really sexy win,” Muschamp 
said. “I was going to come in here with my 
shirt off, but my wife and the players did not 
want me to do that.”
  Florida’s 37-26 win against Florida State 
(10-2, 7-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) was more than simply revenge.
  The victory was the Gators’ 11th despite 
facing one of the nation’s toughest schedules. Florida’s 12 opponents have a combined 92-50 record this season, and ﬁ  ve have spent 
time ranked among the top 10 in the BCS 
standings. UF is 4-1 against those teams.
  The Gators (11-1, 7-1 Southeastern Con-
ference) ended the ﬁ  nal weekend of the reg-
ular season with a body of work beﬁ  tting a 
national championship contender.
“Our resume speaks for itself,” Mus-
champ said. “Come on, you’ve seen where we’ve played, who we’ve played, and the quality of football teams we’ve beaten. We’ll play anyone anywhere.”
  Florida’s BCS National Championship 
Game aspirations were dashed when No. 1 
Notre Dame held off USC 22-13 late Satur-
day night in Los Angeles.
  After ﬁ  nishing last season a dismal 7-6, 
the Gators made their ﬁ  nal claim in the na-tional title race. They won the same way 
they have all season — by doing what they 
couldn’t do last year.
  Florida opened up an early 13-0 lead with 
three scoring drives on its ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve posses-sions. Three of the Gators’ ﬁ  rst four drives 
lasted 10 or more plays.
  In its previous ﬁ  ve games, Florida had 
only four drives with a double-digit play 
count, two of which came during a 23-0 win 
against FCS foe Jacksonville State on Nov . 
17. The nation’s 104th-ranked offense was 
efﬁ  cient and clicking early on.
  Unfortunately for the Gators, a combina-
tion of botched trick plays and a mid-game 
slump typical of offensive coordinator Brent 
Pease’s much-maligned unit resulted in a 
13-0 lead morphing into a 20-13 deﬁ  cit late in the third quarter.
  Instead of panicking, Florida simply did 
what it has done all season: ﬁ  nish strong.
  “We kept saying the second half is our

At the most recent Presidential Search 
Committee meeting, chairman David 
Brown asked members to reserve the weekends of Dec. 7 through Dec. 9 and Jan. 10 through Jan. 12 for possible candi-
date interviews.
Search consultant Jan Greenwood 
said Tuesday her ﬁ  rm contacted 363 po-
tential candidates who could take over once current UF President Bernie Machen steps down. As of Nov. 7, there were 19 applicants for the position. Two have since dropped out, said Dianna Morgan, chairwoman of the Marketing and Com-
munications Subcommittee. Greenwood 
estimated that one to three people would apply “in the eleventh hour.”
Jamie Lewis Keith, vice president and 
general counsel, said the top three themes in the interview questions were the stu-
dent experience and balance of academ-
ics, vision for UF becoming a top 10 public research university, and vision for meet-ing budget challenges.
Campus Interview Subcommittee 
chair Scott Nygren said each candidate will participate in faculty and open fo-rums, where he or she will give a speech, answer questions and meet attendees.
Nygren said the open forum, which is 
targeted primarily at students, staff and Gainesville community members, will likely have an RSVP policy due to its size.

Registration season is here, which for 
many UF students means hours of stalk-
ing ISIS, consulting friends about courses 
and researching professors.
But this year, Paul Nickerson wants to 
make the schedule-selection process less 
painful.
The 24-year-old biochemistry junior 
created the Google Chrome extension ISIS 
Registration Helper. 
It enables teachers’ names to be viewed 
next to the course information and pro-vides direct links to their pages on www.ratemyprofessors.com, a website that 
shows opinions about professors and their 
classes.
“It’s sort of a mineﬁ  eld when you’re 
registering for classes,” Nickerson said, adding he wanted to make registration 
more convenient, so students can choose 
the teachers they want.

Gay Movie Night — 
“Christopher and his Kind”
Based on writer Christopher Isherwood’s critical-ly acclaimed memoir, “Christopher and His Kind,” this landmark BBC adap-tation gives a fascinating glimpse into the decadent and politically unstable world 
of 1930s Berlin. The film will 
play Friday at 7:30 p.m. at Pride Community Center, at 3131 NW 13th St. A young, wide-eyed Christopher (Matt Smith — “Doctor Who”) es-capes repressive English so-ciety and arrives in Berlin at a time when the cabaret scene 
is in full swing. Launched 
into the thriving gay subcul-ture, Christopher embarks on a potent journey of self-discovery amid the vibrant atmosphere of Berlin’s caba-ret nightlife and the dark rise of Nazi politics. Gay Movie Night is on the last Friday 
of each month at 7:30 p.m. Donate to the OAS Toy Drive

Nov. 24, 1975: Gainesville 
Girl Scouts painted about 35 
fire hydrants around town 
red, white and blue in cele-bration of the city’s bicenten-
nial. The Gainesville Police 
Department reported two hydrants had been defaced 
with green marijuana leaves 
painted in the middle of the white stars, along with the words “Legalize marijuana.”
Nov. 28, 1989: The Reitz 
Union Ballroom was trans-formed into a castle for Mad-rigal Dinners, sponsored by 
UF’s music department. The 
meal featured Medieval-style menu items such as spiced 
ale, Yorkshire pudding and 
flaming plum pudding. UF musicians and costumed ac-tors provided entertainment, ranging from love songs per -
formed by minstrels to tricks performed by jugglers.
Nov. 27, 1991: The UF Col-
lege of Veterinary Medicine came under scrutiny for ne-
glected birds and rodents 
discovered in several labs. The animals included mice, 
rats, chickens, pigeons, par -
akeets and gerbils. Animal 
rights activists tried to use 
the incident to leverage shut-
ting down all UF animal re-search, but UF veterinarian 
Farol Tomson said the inves-
tigation was proof that safe-guards against abuse work.
Nov. 30, 2009: Quarter -
back Tim Tebow played his 
last game in the Swamp 
against Florida State Univer -
sity. Even though the Gators 
scored a 37-10 win, rival fans 
lingered in the stadium to see him off. Senior Brandon 
Spikes celebrated the victory 
by lying on the grass in the middle of the field and do-
ing an impression of a snow 
angel.

Santa Claus will come to 
Gainesville early this year, and he’ll 
bring a brilliantly lit tree with him.
Santa, Christmas carols and car -
riage rides will be part of the city’s Annual Holiday Tree Lighting Cel-ebration on Saturday, said Katha-
rine Forbes, marketing technician 
for the City of Gainesville Depart-ment of Parks, Recreation and Cul-tural Affairs.
The free event will be from 6 
p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Thomas Cen-ter, located on 302 NE Sixth Ave. The center is a post-Victorian build-ing from the early 1900s.
“The heart of the celebration 
are the decorations at the historic Thomas Center,” Forbes said.
There will be a Christmas tree 
on the Spanish Court of the center, 
which Mayor Craig Lowe will light, 
Forbes said.
Caroling by the Singers of the 
Reformation and the Gainesville 
Harmony Show Chorus will also be featured at the event.
The center hosted the event last 
year, Forbes said, and it has been 
celebrated for more than 25 years.
Carriage rides will also be of-
fered from 6 p.m. to 9:45 p.m. Rides 
cost $6 for adults 
and $1 for chil-dren, Forbes said.
  The 
Gainesville Re-gional Utilities and the Thomas 
Center are spon-
soring the event. According to its 
website, GRU will have a booth set up at the event with holiday-themed giveaways and historical 
utility artifacts.
The celebration attracts about 
700 people each year, Forbes said. 
They expect this year’s turnout to 
be the same.
The Department of Parks, Recre-
ation and Cultural Affairs will also 
host a New Years countdown cel-ebration Dec. 31 at 10 p.m., Forbes 
said. The free event will be held on

a lot of student-based insight about UF 
professors. 
Nickerson said it allows students to en-
roll in classes with some prior knowledge 
of what they’re getting into.
When ISIS Registration Helper users 
are on ISIS looking up a section, they can right-click, press “Add professor names,” 
and a column will appear with names and 
links.
Nickerson recently posted the extension 
on Reddit, and since then, he estimates 
about 200 people have downloaded it.
Nickerson said the extension is safe for 
users, and it cannot track their informa-
tion. 
The source code is provided on his in-
structional web page.
Programming is one of his hobbies, and 
it only took him about seven or eight hours to create the extension, he said.
“I’ve been programming for years and 
years, so it’s not too complex,” he said. 
“It’s just figuring out how the pieces fit 
together.”
Jackie Lopez, a 20-year-old French ju-nior, said students often get frustrated 
with ISIS during registration time because 
they are trying to get the best professors.
Finding them sometimes involves too 
much research, she said. 
Lopez said she rarely spends time on 
ISIS during the semester, but during regis-tration, she uses it at least twice a day.
Lopez said she does not want to end up 
dropping a class because she did not get 
her preferred professor.
“All I want to do is get my schedule,” 
she said.
But biology junior Corinne Fuchs, 20, 
said she does not mind the time it takes to coordinate her professors and course 
information.
“I’m technically inclined, so it doesn’t 
bother me,” she said. “All [the extension] does is eliminate one step.”
Fuchs said it is difficult to get the cor -
rect combination of classes for a semester. 
She said multiple tabs on ISIS would 
make registration easier.
As for Nickerson’s extension, UF 
spokesman Steve Orlando said anything 
that helps students choose a course can be 
beneficial to them.
However, the official faculty evalua-tions students complete at the end of every 
semester provide information that’s prob-
ably more concrete and usable, he said.
“If I were a student looking at some of 
those ‘rate my professors’ entries,” Orlan-do said, “I think I would probably take it 
with a little bit of a grain of salt.”

UF’s Historical Preservation Pro-
gram purchased a FARO Focus3D la-
ser scanner earlier this month to docu-ment sites throughout the country , preserving 3D scans of any location. 
Its goal is to focus on the documenta-
tion, preservation and management of cultural heritage, according to a pro-gram proposal.
The scanner was paid for through 
grants and donations to the Histori-cal Preservation Program, totaling $100,000, said Morris Hylton III, direc-tor of historic preservation at UF.
The FARO Focus3D is a three-di-
mensional laser scanner that creates photorealistic plans, sections, eleva-tions and Historic American Building Survey-quality line drawings. The scanner creates an efficient and accu-rate measurement of sites and their surroundings, both interiors and exte-riors, according to the proposal.
“The laser technology has been 
around for years, primarily for land surveying, but it has improved dra-matically within the past five years,” Hylton said.
According to the FARO website, 
the scanner works by collecting points in space captured by a laser beam that reflects objects and surfaces it encoun-
ters. It then creates a 3D virtual model 
that documents the structure’s design and existing conditions.
In the spring, the FARO scanner 
will be used in a preservation project, Envision: MiMo, about the conditions of midcentury modern Miami sites such as the former Bacardi Headquar -
ters and the Miami Marine Stadium, according to the project proposal.
Eventually, the products can be-
come part of the Envision Heritage database, where multiple scans of sites can be stored in one location, allowing people to experience them without ac-tually visiting.
The scanner is used for 3D building 
documentation, construction super -
vision, reverse engineering, historic preservation and even interior design, according to the FARO website.
“In interior design, we not only 
look at the design of the room but how people actually inhabit the space,” Hylton said.
The FARO Focus3D assigns dis-
tance to the surface objects by calculat-ing the time of flight 
of the laser in rela-tion to the known speed of light. As it scans, it collects between 122,000 to 976,000 points a 
second, depending 
on the resolution of the selected scan, 
according to the FARO website.
“One of the main benefits of the 
scanner is that it is both accurate and fast,” said Brian Shea, 26, a graduate research assistant working on mas-ter’s degrees in historic preservation and urban regional planning. “With 
the scanner, one room can be docu-
mented in mere minutes, rather than documenting by hand, which could take hours.”
The FARO laser scanner has been 
ordered and it is set to arrive at UF in December. It will then be used by the College of Design, Construction and Planning.UF program gets laser

The Nov . 23 opening of the 
downtown Plaza Ice Palace 
skating rink has been post-
poned until Friday due to tech-
nical problems.
The ice rink, which will be 
on the Bo Diddley Community 
Plaza, will remain open a week 
later than planned to make up for the delay. It closes Jan. 13.
Midwest Display, the com-
pany providing and managing the rink, experienced “techni-cal difficulties,” according to a press statement released Tues-
day from Gainesville’s Depart-
ment of Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs. 
The rink, which is sponsored 
by Gainesville Regional Utilities, 
will be open weekdays from 4 
p.m. to 10 p.m. and weekends from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.Renting skates for an hour 
costs $10. People who bring 
their own skates can skate for 
an hour for $7.
The yearly city-funded ice 
rink was canceled after 2007 
because of budget issues, ac-
cording to Alligator archives. Midwest Display approached the city and offered to bring back the rink. The company will 
set up the rink as a vendor, and 
the city will get a portion of the proceeds. Plaza Ice Palace skating rink

The Southwest 13th Street overpass was delayed due to 
erosion from Tropical Storm Debby. It’s set to open soon.
MARISA ROSS
Alligator Contributing Writer
The pedestrian overpass on South-
west 13th Street remains closed, and 
some city cyclists are frustrated.   
The construction project for the 
twisted structure, which resembles a double helix, began in March in the College Park and University Heights 
areas. It was supposed to be open for 
use earlier this fall, but unexpected weather conditions delayed the con-struction.
Laura Rawson, a city communica-
tions assistant, wrote that Tropical Storm Debby set back opening plans. She wrote in an email the storm caused some erosion, but the railroad 
bridge turned pathway is expected to 
be ready in December.
One Gainesville resident said he feels cyclists are more likely to get 
into accidents because of the bridge’s 
impediment.
“Whenever a bicyclist has to share 
the road with cars, there is a greater chance of the bicyclist being hurt,” 
wrote Terry Rickey, a 57-year-old 
Gainesville cyclist, via email. “I’ve talked with several people about [this], and everyone is in agreement 
that this is a terrible intersection to 
negotiate when traveling east to west.”
He said he originally saw signs 
near the bridge that stated the open-ing was set for September, but there are currently no signs with informa-
tion. Since then, Rickey said he spoke 
to various workers, but he said he was told different dates and has not received a specific answer as to when 
the path will be usable.
Rickey bikes to Shands at UF from 
home and said he saw an accident 
near the bridge and Archer Road when he was waiting to cross the 
street in mid-November.
A cyclist was on the sidewalk go-
ing downhill, he said, when a wom-
an in a Chevrolet TrailBlazer pulled 
into the crosswalk to make a right 
turn on red. The bicyclist turned into the intersection and slammed into the front of the vehicle. Rickey said the man flew into the air and flipped 
before he hit the ground.
“I can’t help but to think that if 
the overhead pass had been open, 
this accident would never have hap-
pened,” he said.Opening of pedestrian, bicycle path

In the event that someone 
calls to ask for the van, an avail-
able SNAP worker will pick up 
the wheelchair-accessible van 
and get the waiting student.
UF’s Transportation and Park-
ing Services ordered and paid for the $41,118 van, Director Scott 
Fox wrote in an email.
Fox said this is the first request 
for rides from wheelchair users.
Holcomb said the idea was 
brought to University Police by 
student senators.
During Spring, Dounia Ben-
dris, now a 20-year-old art junior, wrote a letter to senators explain-
ing the problems she had getting 
home because she would stay in the art studio late into the night, and SNAP was not wheelchair-accessible.
After 11 p.m., there was no 
option for wheelchair users pro-
vided by UF’s transportation ser -
vices.
“RTS certainly is an option, 
which we encourage students to use!” Fox wrote. “At the same 
time — if some students have access to SNAP , we believe all students should have access to SNAP .”
Currently, the SNAP fleet in-
cludes four 15-passenger vans. The new van will not be included in the fleet but will be available to 
SNAP for nights and weekends, 
Holcomb said.
During the day , the van may 
be used for Gator Lift, Campus Cab service or conventional 
transportation needs, Fox said.
The Campus Cab taxi service 
is used for official university busi-ness. Gator Lift is used for UF stu-
dents, faculty and staff who have temporary or permanent disabil-ities, according to the transpor -
tation website. Transportation 
services has three Gator Lift ve-
hicles that can accommodate ten passengers and two wheelchairs. Fox said a Gator Lift vehicle has 
a hydraulic lift that requires spe-
cialized training.
The new wheelchair-accessi-
ble van can be driven by SNAP workers, and drivers can oper -
ate the foldout wheelchair ramp 
with little training, he said.

Gators fans will be able to pur -
chase tickets to various UF sport-
ing events at discounted prices on GatorZone today as a part of Cyber Monday.
From 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., discount-
ed tickets will be sold for men’s basketball, women’s basketball, gymnastics and baseball games.
Fred Demarest, assistant athlet-
ics director/new media and stra-tegic communications, wrote in an email this is the first time the Uni-versity Athletic Association has of-fered this promotion.
“The marketing department 
originally developed this as a Black 
Friday sale,” he said. “But after 
evaluation, Cyber Monday just made a lot more sense. It’s obvi-ously the biggest online shopping day of the year, so it was kind of a no-brainer to target this date.”
The UAA wanted to offer dis-
counted tickets for a variety of sports and games. The first home 
SEC game for men’s basketball will 
be discounted, as well as the home opener for gymnastics.“The ticket office and market-
ing have worked together to offer a very nice mix of opportunities to purchase affordable tickets in mul-tiple sports,” he wrote. “They’ve offered some nonconference and 
league games in men’s basketball, 
some of our women’s hoops pro-grams most attractive matchups, as well as options for our gymnastics and baseball programs.”
Molly Vazquez, a 20-year-old 
public relations junior, said she plans to buy tickets as a gift.
“My dad has never been to a UF 
basketball game, so I’m going to buy tickets for him as a Christmas present,” she said.UAA offering discounted tickets today

A few weeks ago, Jan Smith walked into her kitchen 
and found her dog in a pool of blood.
The Clermont, Fla., resident went home after a day 
of running errands to see her poodle-Siberian Husky 
mix, Jackie, bleeding with a swollen head. Jackie was bitten by a rattlesnake, and the veterinarian said she had less than a 40 percent chance of survival.
But Jackie lived because of the UF Small Animal 
Hospital. There, she became the first animal treated in the hospital’s new hyperbaric chamber.
Jackie was referred to Dr. Alessio Vigani, a resident 
in anesthisia, emergency and critical-care medicine at the hospital. Smith said Vigani was afraid Jackie would require surgery because there was so much venom in her body.
“That was going to be really bad for us,” Smith said. 
“It’d be an additional expense and additional stress on her.”
Vigani recommended Jackie for treatment in the 
hyperbaric chamber, a procedure that delivers oxygen by applying pressure to the animal’s skin. He said the chamber increases oxygenation to tissue and restores blood flow.
Smith said her family was willing to try the cham-ber because it was less invasive than surgery.
“Not having to have the surgery was a major plus,” 
she said. “She might not have made it. She could’ve been disfigured.”
Vigani said four animals have been treated since 
Jackie. He said the staff was amazed by how quickly animals progressed after they received treatment in the chamber.
“None of us were expecting to see such a significant 
improvement within a very short course of treatment,” 
he said. “In the past, it might have taken months.”
Vigani said all of the families who have brought 
animals have been from out of town. He said the new 
technology may bring attention to Gainesville.
“There’s definitely a chance it’ll increase the income 
of the hospital and the town,” he said.
Smith said she’s grateful for the university’s veteri-
nary care.
“They are just top-of-the-line,” she said. “They are 
the best I’ve encountered.”Procedure breath of fresh air for vetsIt will be ready in December

Apply to be a 
columnist! 
‘Tis the season to be opinionated, folks!
You’re reading UF’s newspaper. It’s ﬁ  lled with photos, 
important news stories, not-so-important news stories and 
ballin’ reports on sports.
What ﬁ  lls pages six and seven? Opinions. A whole mess of 
opinions. This is the place where you can write to us to vent 
your frustrations or to praise your peers. You can read politi-cal disdain next to a religious point of view you might not have considered before.
Our columnists are all UF students who happen to be real 
people, just like you! You might have noticed that not all of them are journalism majors, nor do they have any prior column-writ-ing training.
Half of you will take that into consideration and admire the 
pluck it takes to write a column each week while thinking to yourself, “Wow, I could never do that because they are much more brave than I.” Half of you will immediately say, “Yeah, I can tell they don’t have prior column-writing training because they suck worse than you do.”
Then we dare you to do better. We are incredibly proud of our 
columnists each semester, but there’s always room for more.
It doesn’t take much to be an opinions columnist, but it has 
turned into a ﬁ  ne art. You write 600 words a week. You form 
hard opinions on current events and present them with facts and 
evidence. You deal with criticism on the Internet because, well, that’s what people do on the Internet. You might not need a ton of experience to jump into this job, but you need a ton of tenac-ity.
Columnists are invited to reapply for their position after each 
semester, but we also opened application submission to every-one else.
Join us. It’s not scary, we promise. It’s like ripping off a Band-
Aid. Send us a resume, cover letter and two or three writing samples of 500 to 600 words each.
If you’ve ever wished that your voice was better represented, 
or you want to try and add some spice to your resume, apply. If you want to better the world by writing about all the good things that go on in town, apply. If you are upset about the elec-tion results, whether the national election or on campus, apply.
Are you a feminist? Are you a humanist? Do your friends 
complain about how much you complain? Do you think the hip-
ster voice is underrepresented and want to correct that? When 
was the last time you agreed with something in this paper? 
Apply.This is the most direct way to get your voice out. These pages 
are your haven, where you can be free to express your thoughts on nearly every subject under the sun. We feature writers from every walk of life, but only if they apply. Some readers emailed us asking why certain columnists were allowed to speak their minds in these pages. It’s because they applied to do it, so stop 
complaining if you don’t like it.
It’s kind of like those annoying people who say you can’t 
complain about an election unless you vote, except more fun.
The deadline for applications is Friday.Stop succumbing to Black Friday scams
It’s time for Black Friday to be illegal. Seriously.
No, this isn’t just sour grapes from a guy shut out of 
buying some $20 phone or whatever the hell Walmart 
deal was the good one this year.
And while it’s true Black Friday deals aren’t all that in-
teresting when you can barely afford food on a daily basis, 
I’m not saying this because I’m jealous of people who have 
the money to drop $400 on a seventh TV simply because it’s on sale.
Listen, guys, Black Friday makes us look stupid. I’m 
sure you’ve seen at least one of those ridiculous videos that 
look more like Chicago during the 1968 Democratic Nation-
al Convention than the aisle of every Walmart in America. Those people are ﬁ  ghting for the privilege of paying Wal-
mart less money than they usually would for a product 
they don’t need.
That’s what Black Friday is all about: buying things for 
yourself and for other people because of want not because 
of need.
I don’t believe Christmas should consist of getting ex-
actly what you want.
I think this complex in the American consciousness, 
which I’ll term the Black Friday Complex, derives partly from the (admittedly awesome) movie “A Christmas Sto-
ry.” 
If you haven’t seen that movie, shame on you, ﬁ  rst of all. 
But, the ending is: a little boy has the best and most memo-
rable Christmas of his life because his dad got him exactly 
what he wanted.
So, America, after seeing that movie, subconsciously 
made this axiomatic oversimpliﬁ  cation: If I get someone 
exactly what they want for Christmas, then our Christmas 
together will be memorable and heartwarming.
You hear people say, “What do you want for Christmas? 
Make a list of things you want!” This reveals another short-coming of the Black Friday Complex.
When we succumb to the idea that the only acceptable 
gift for someone is the gift that he or she wants (another Christmas-related axiom of our culture), we overlook the fact that getting someone a gift, 
not that they requested but that 
you thought of, is one of the great ways to show how much you love 
someone.
Give from the heart, not the 
wallet.
And this is where Black Friday 
comes in.
The commercials and the entire culture surrounding 
Black Friday support the ideas that money can buy love and gifts can buy affection. The proliferation of that culture has 
infected the way we receive gifts as well as give them.
We think the only people who deserve our affection are 
the people who give us the expensive gifts we asked for.
It’s a self-perpetuating cycle of destructive materialism 
that leads to people bashing one another in the head at 5:30 a.m. in ﬁ  ts of sweet potato-induced madness, trying to buy 
half-priced video game consoles.
I’m not down with that cycle.I just wish it could be otherwise.
Our culture is ingrained with a lot of materialism, but 
that’s healthy because it gives us a reason to want to edu-
cate, improve and advance ourselves in order to acquire 
things.
In the acquisition of things, we can forget there are peo-
ple around us: people who are worth more than things that 
can be bought.
So please, this holiday season, don’t ask for the newest 
TV or game system; settle for a real gift from someone who really loves you.
Also, when you open your gift from me and ﬁ  nd that it’s 
actually a piece of wood from my backyard fence with your 
name and a smiley face gouged into it, don’t hate me for 
being a cheapskate. Really.
I’m just rebelling against a culture of American material-
ism. I swear.

On Nov. 15, a demonstration was held on 
Turlington Plaza titled “UF Stands With 
Israel.”
Does UF really stand with Israel?
Does UF stand for ethnic cleansing, colonial-
ism, apartheid, occupation and the killing of innocent civilians via the state terrorism of the Israel Defense Forces/Israel?
UF Hillel, Zionist Gators and others may 
stand for Israel, but I would appreciate if they didn’t speak for the entire university.
Those who were on Turlington claimed they 
were pro-peace, but many of those same people refuse to acknowledge that Gaza is an open-air prison where the Israeli government dictates calorie intake in order to ensure the citizens have only enough to get by.
Those same people don’t see a problem with 
the settlements in the West Bank, which are widely interpreted (from the Fourth Geneva Convention) as illegal.
Living in a society that is overwhelmingly 
Zionist can easily be-come discouraging, and at times, it can make me wonder if I’m insane.
But, the fact is, this 
issue is not difficult to interpret.
It’s clear what’s right and what’s wrong, and 
to keep that conviction is essential to moving to-ward justice. When I’m at home reading articles or watching live streams, looking at images of mutilated bodies in Gaza and Palestinian babies killed, emotions run high.
It is shocking to me that something like this 
can be allowed to go on. Then, to come to cam-pus and see massive amounts of students rally-ing in support of Israel is just a slap in the face.
It’s bad enough to know something like this 
is happening, but to feel completely surrounded by people who encourage it is sickening.
At the end of the day, though, I know I am 
right.
I know where I stand. I know there are hun-
dreds of thousands of people who stand with 
me. Being distant from the struggle can be iso-
lating, but to know that there are people out there putting their lives on the line to make sure Israel’s war crimes do not go unnoticed is in-spiring.
There are mass protests in almost every 
country, every state and almost every city in America. Even at UF, there are students who know what is just and demand the rest of the world recognizes it, too.
The Gator Nation can’t be seen as a com-
munity that condones collective punishment, apartheid or murder. Gaza must know it is not alone in this battle and the rest of the world does stand behind it.
We do not stand in isolation, we stand to-
gether, and we will continue to fight against the propaganda and the racism.
“Apartheid is a crime against humanity. Isra-
el has deprived millions of Palestinians of their liberty and property. It has perpetuated a system of gross racial discrimination and inequality. It has systematically incarcerated and tortured thousands of Palestinians, contrary to the rules of international law.”- Nelson Mandela

Speaking OutEditor’s Note: This article was submitted before a ceasefire be-
tween Israel and Hamas went into effect on Wednesday. 
Today, after more than seven years of Israel’s with-
drawal from Gaza in exchange for peace, we stand faced with increased rocket fire from Hamas, an or -
ganization on the United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations.  
In the past 12 years, more than 12,000 rockets have been 
fired from Gaza into Israel.  
In the past year, more than 800 rockets have been fired 
from Gaza into Israel.  
In the past few days, more than 1,000 rockets have been 
fired from Gaza into Israel.  
I propose a simple question with a complex answer: 
When is it enough?
On Sept. 11, 2001, terrorists attacked the United States.  Within days and with overwhelming support, the Unit-
ed States government declared the “War on Terror.”  
American officials did not wait until further attacks or 
further terror to guarantee the safety and protection of its citizens.  
Why is Israel held to a different standard?  Hamas, labeled a terrorist organization by the United 
States, the EU and Israel, fired countless rockets into Israel last week, as they have done historically.  
This is unequivocally an act of terror by a terrorist or -
ganization.  
To clarify media misconceptions, the current situation 
between Gaza and Israel is not a matter of the Israeli gov-ernment versus the Palestinian leadership; it is a conflict of increased terrorist activity, spurred by Hamas and backed by Iran, the world’s largest state sponsor of terror, onto the 
citizens of Israel.   
“There is no moral symmetry; there is no moral equiva-
lence, between Israel and the terrorist organizations in Gaza,” said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.   
Hamas has made it clear through its charter that its main 
goal is the destruction of the people and the state of Israel 
by any means necessary.  
“The terrorists are committing a double-war crime.  
They fire at Israeli civilians, and they hide behind Palestin-ian civilians,” said Netanyahu.  The Israeli Defense Forces stra-
tegically targets infrastructure, including weapons stockpiles, in Gaza and has taken extraordinary steps to minimize Palestinian ca-sualties.  
The Israeli Defense Forces go as far as to send out thou-
sands of leaflets, phone calls, text messages and radio sig-nals, warning civilians to leave Hamas areas.   
Despite the conflict, Israel continues to send food, water, 
electricity and medical supplies into Gaza.  
Israel, as a sovereign nation, has every right to protect 
itself from Hamas, a terrorist organization, just like the U.S.  had every right to protect itself from Al Qaeda, a terrorist organization, 11 years ago.
I ask again.  
When is it enough?  
It is enough now.  
The terror has to stop now.  
The bombs have to stop now.  The sirens have to stop now.  We need peace now.  
The first female prime minister of Israel, Golda Meir, put 
it perfectly:
“Peace will come when the Arabs will love their children 
more than they hate us.”
I know where I stand today.  
I stand for peace.  I stand for prosperity. I stand for security.  
I stand with America.  
I stand with our allies.  I stand with Israel.  I stand with Israel, today, tomorrow and always.  
Am Yisrael Chai.  
The people of Israel live.

A recently released study suggests it’s more 
important for beginning runners to hit the streets 
with enthusiasm than to seek advice on tech-niques, but Gainesville running experts have divided opinions about how to pound the pave-
ment.
Conducted in England and published in the 
scientific journal Medicine and Science in Sports 
and Exercise, the study monitored 10 participants without previous experience and instruction who began running during a 10-week period. It found participants avoided injury and devel-oped comfortable running styles, which enabled each to run faster and farther than before.
Rob Barnes, president of the Gainesville-
based Florida Track Club, said focusing on tech-nical aspects of running is like “putting the cart before the horse.”
“Running form is going to change very quick-
ly as you grow as a runner,” Barnes said. “People become much faster and more efficient as they continue running.”
Gainesville chiropractor and marathon run-
ner John J. Johnston said it’s unnecessary to impose guidelines on runners who are just start-ing out. He said that by critiquing new runners’ style, people risk discouraging them.
“I’m so happy when a person goes from a 
non-runner to a runner, and I’m hoping they get addicted to it,” said Johnston. “When I hear someone is trying it out, I don’t want to do any-thing that would get in the way.”
Johnston said analysis becomes helpful at 
high levels of competition, but at the beginning, newbies will gravitate toward running in a way that’s naturally most comfortable for them.
“All that technical stuff kind of figures itself 
out,” he said.
But Laura Kubitz, a 24-year-old UF alumna 
and former member of the TriGators Triathlon Team, said beginning runners should have “at least some instruction” to avoid injuries.
Kubitz picked up running her sophomore 
year, but she was forced to stop due to plantar fasciitis, characterized by foot pain from overex-ertion.
Kubitz consulted a track coach, who advised 
her to work on her form to remedy the issue. She took the advice, adopting a straighter posture and striking the ground with her midfoot instead of toe or heel.
Suzanne Farina, a group fitness instructor 
at Gainesville Health and Fitness, said the pat-tern of seeking technique guidance after injury is typical.
Although it never hurts to get pointers, Farina 
said establishing a habit of running comes first, and motivation is the key ingredient.
“I think that’s the bigger question: What do 
we have to do to get people motivated to run?” Farina said. “If you don’t do something on a reg-ular basis, you’re not going to want to invest the energy to see if you’re doing it right.”8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 2012

PSY officially galloped his way to the top 
of the YouTube world.
With more than 817 million views, the 
34-year-old South Korean singer’s “Gang-
nam Style” music video became the most 
watched YouTube video of all time, the 
website announced on its Trends blog Sat-urday.As of Sunday night, “Gangnam Style” 
surpassed Justin Bieber’s’ 2010 “Baby” mu-sic video by about 15 million views.
The video features PSY galloping and 
singing in a variety of locations, including a stable, bus, tennis court and female yoga class.
Park Jae-sang, whose stage name is PSY, 
wrote the song as a satirical interpretation of the Gangnam District of Seoul. 
The song, which is sung mostly in Kore-an, has found its way into American nightclub play-lists, a “Saturday Night Live” sketch and even the Pride of the Sunshine ’s gameday set list.
Following the July re-
lease of “Gangnam Style,” the video went viral in August. It continues to re-
ceive about seven to 10 million views a day, according to the blog, and the keywords “Gangnam Style” and “PSY” have been the top searches on YouTube in the last six months.
PSY’s YouTube channel has also received 
more than one billion collective video views — two billion shy of Bieber’s channel.

 �BABB DECIDED TO EXPAND 
HER PROJECT TO SHANDS HOSPITAL FOR CHILDREN.
MINA RADMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
When her friend was diagnosed 
with cancer, Jackie Babb decided 
the best medicine was a fluffy friend. Five years later, she and her bears still bring smiles to sick chil-
dren.
Jackie Babb, a 21-year-old UF 
biology senior, was a high school 
sophomore who had just learned how to quilt when her best friend was diagnosed with cancer. Babb wanted to give a personalized gift, so she stitched together a teddy bear.The fabric teddy bear became 
the basis for Sharebear, a volunteer 
project Babb created in 2007. Since 
then, she said, it has delivered more than 500 teddy bears to Chris Evert Children’s Hospital in Fort Lauder -
dale and Shands Hospital for Chil-dren at UF in Gainesville.
“We ended up just drawing a 
bear out on a piece of paper, cutting the fabric to the same size and leav-
ing a hole to stuff it,” Babb said. “It 
kind of happened on a whim, and we came up with it together.”
One of Babb’s high school teach-
ers encouraged his students to do community service and to create their own volunteer projects. Babb remembered the teddy bear she had created and thought it would 
be nice to create more bears for 
children in her community.“I thought, ‘Oh, this is some-
thing I can do. This is something easy, and I’m able to get other kids involved and raise awareness for children in the hospital,’” Babb 
said. “It’s rough, especially for cancer patients who spend long periods of time there.”
Babb en-
listed the help of friends and 
family, includ-
ing family friend Ilona Farnes, to 
help her vision become a reality. Farnes said her sewing room be-came Sharebear’s headquarters in its early days.
“I sewed the first 200 bears while 
[Babb] recruited other kids to come help,” Farnes said, “and there were times where my living room had 10 
kids in it doing their different jobs, 
working on mass-producing the bears and just having fun.”
Once the project was off the 
ground, Babb said she began donat-ing bears to Chris Evert Children’s Hospital, near her hometown of Coconut Creek, Fla.
“When she saw how excited the 
kids were to get something, it in-spired her to continue the project,” Farnes said.
In 2011, Babb volunteered at 
Shands at UF. Although she was away from her hometown, she con-tinued to create and donate bears to Chris Evert Children’s Hospi-tal. She said she hadn’t thought of 
transferring that practice to Shands 
Hospital for Children until she met a young girl who wanted a cuddly friend.
During a volunteering shift, 
Babb was introduced to a young patient and asked to entertain her for the day. Babb asked the girl if she wanted to play board games, but the girl’s mom said she was too young to understand board games.
The little girl asked Babb if she 
could find her a stuffed animal to play with, and she got the idea to expand her program so children could enjoy the fabric friends, too.
“They’re a source of imagination 
and play, especially for kids who don’t know how to play games,” she said. “It’s a completely differ -
ent toy for them.”

� GILLISLEE BECAME FLORIDA’S FIRST 
1,000-YARD RUSHER SINCE CIATRICK FASON RAN FOR 1,326 YARDS IN 2004.

 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 TALLAHASSEE — Will Muschamp called his 
team soft last season after UF closed out a dismal 
year with an embarrassing home loss to Florida 
State.
  There was nothing soft about the Gators on 
Saturday night. 
While run-heavy Florida started the game 
with ﬁ  ve throws in its ﬁ  rst seven offensive plays, 
UF punished Florida State with bruising runs from backs Mike Gillislee and Matt Jones.
  The duo combined for 221 rushing yards 
against the nation’s then top-ranked rushing de-
fense.
  “They haven’t seen anybody with the line that 
we have — the way [we] run block,” quarterback 
Jeff Driskel said of Florida State. “They haven’t 
seen as much depth as we have at running back. 
We’re going to run hard, and our running backs, when they get a crease, they’re going to make somebody miss, and they did that. We knew we 
were going to be able to run the ball. That was 
never an issue.”
  Gillislee eclipsed the 1,000-yard mark with 
140 yards on 24 carries for his ﬁ  fth 100-yard 
game this season. 
He is the ﬁ  rst Gators back to rush for 1,000 
yards since Ciatrick Fason gained 1,326 yards in 2004.
  Gillislee’s 140 yards are more than Florida 
State had allowed to any team this season. The 
Seminoles entered the game allowing 70.6 rush-ing yards per game. Florida ﬁ  nished with 244.
  “I always knew Mike could do that,” wide re-
ceiver Quinton Dunbar said of Gillislee’s season total. “He was just waiting for his chance. Now that he’s got his chance, he’s taking (advantage of) his opportunity.”
  With 11:01 remaining in the fourth quarter, 
Gillislee scampered untouched off left tackle for 37 yards and the last of his two touchdowns. The 
go-ahead score put Florida up 23-20.
  “The offensive line did a great job of block-
ing, and I saw all I needed was a good seam,” 
Gillislee said. “I saw it, and I just hit it — touch-
down.”
  After suffering a rib injury on the next series, 
the senior gave way to the freshman Jones.
  Jones added a career-high 81 yards and a 
touchdown on the ground. 
  Six teams this season have posted fewer than 
81 rushing yards against Florida State.  
  As the Gators have all season, they wore down 
the opponent’s defensive line. Florida rushed for Running back hits milestone, carries Florida to victory

 TALLAHASSEE — Florida remained 
ranked at No. 4 in the BCS standings on 
Sunday night. UF is behind No. 1 Notre Dame, No. 2 Alabama and No. 3 Georgia.
  The Gators will likely move up to No. 
3, overtaking the loser of the Southeastern Conference Championship   Game between the Crimson Tide and the Bulldogs.
  According to the BCS selection proce-
dures, the third-ranked team receives   an at-large bid to a BCS bowl if no other at-large team from its conference qualiﬁ  es to   play in the national championship. Notre Dame will likely play the winner of the SEC title game in the BCS Championship Game, leaving UF as the highest-ranked at-large SEC team.   The Sugar Bowl, which has hosted an 
SEC at-large team all but once since the introduction of the BCS National Cham-pionship Game in 2007, appears to be the Gators’ likely destination.
  
  Roberson on returns: With Florida cling-ing to a three-point lead, cornerback Mar-cus Roberson gave the Gators the type of boost they have rarely had this season — a big punt return.
  Florida State punter Cason Beatty boot-
ed a season-long 54-yard punt to Florida’s 18-yard line with the Seminoles trailing 23-20 in the fourth quarter.
  Cornerback Marcus Roberson ﬁ  elded 
the punt, picked up a pair of blockers and sprinted down the left sideline for a gain of 50 yards to the FSU 32-yard line. Five plays Gators remain at No. 4

  TALLAHASSEE
James Wilson and D.J. Humphries stalked up and down UF’s sideline, preparing the Gatorade cooler for 
celebration as the ﬁ  nal seconds ticked off the clock on Saturday in Tallahas-see. 
  In a scene usually reserved for cham-
pionships, the two offensive linemen waited for a window of opportunity to give coach Will Muschamp his celebra-tory bath. 
  With 15 second remaining, Wilson 
and Humphries ﬁ  nally found their opening, splashing Muschamp square in the back with the cooler of purple. Florida’s coach let out a few claps, a double ﬁ  st-pump and a smile — a much-deserved celebration beﬁ  tting a national title. 
  “That was the most excited we’ve 
been in a while,” center Jonotthan Har-rison said. “We’ve worked so hard to get what we’ve earned. I’m proud of the team.”
  Later that night, Notre Dame beat USC 22-13 to ensure that UF won’t play for the BCS cham-pionship. The Gators aren’t even going to Atlanta for the SEC Champion-
ship Game. But this is a team of cham-pions.   
  After a year of slow starts and near 
disasters, Florida looked like a cham-pionship program on Saturday. The Gators locked down the ﬁ  fth 11-win regular season in school history with their best performance of 2012 in a 37-26 win against rival Florida State. 
  “That was a culmination of our foot-
ball season,” Muschamp said. “That football team showed you their resolve and their ﬁ  ght and their oneness and their togetherness, and I’m very proud to be a part of them.”
  Regardless of what happens in the 
UF should be proud of ‘12

“Coach gave me a chance, and I ap-
preciate that,” Roberson said. “We al-ways catch punts through practice. I was just lucky enough and had great blocking on the play. That was big for us.”
With both Andre Debose and 
De’Ante Saunders nursing injuries, Roberson has taken over punt return duties. 
He returned a punt for 31 yards in 
Florida’s win against Jacksonville State on Nov. 17, and his return against Flor -
ida State was the Gators’ longest punt return of the season and their longest punt or kick return since Debose’s 60-yard kick return against Vanderbilt on Oct. 13.
The punt return was also the longest 
for the Gators since Brandon James re-turned one 78 yards for a touchdown against Tennessee in 2008. Despite the magnitude of the play, Roberson downplayed it after the game.
“I feel like everybody is able to make 
plays, and I was just lucky enough to have my chance,” he said.
Sturgis sets record: With a 45-yard 
field goal in the second quarter, Ca-leb Sturgis earned a spot in the record books, surpassing Jeff Chandler’s UF record of 67 field goals in a career. St-urgis’ 39-yard field goal on the game’s opening drive tied the record. He now has 69 career field goals.
Purifoy plays both ways: Loucheiz 
Purifoy started at both cornerback and running back on Saturday, becoming the first Gator to start on both sides of the ball since Keiwan Ratliff started at both cornerback and wide receiver on Nov. 30, 2002 against Florida State. 
Purifoy had one carry for eight 
yards on offense on Saturday and add-ed six tackles and a forced fumble on defense.
Injuries: Jelani Jenkins’ streak of bad 
luck continued on Saturday night.
The junior linebacker left the game 
in the third quarter with an injury to 
his right foot. Jenkins was on crutches 
and wearing a walking boot when he 
spoke to the media after the game. 
“I don’t really know his status,” 
Muschamp said of Jenkins. “But it 
doesn’t look good.”
Jenkins missed three games ear -lier this season due to a fractured right thumb and a hamstring injury. He ex-pressed uncertainty as to the severity of his foot injury.
“I’m not sure exactly what yet,” Jen-
kins said. “It’s kind of sore right now.”
Freshman Antonio Morrison 
stepped in for Jenkins and forced a fumble that led to a 37-yard touchdown 
run from Mike Gillislee on the ensuing 
possession.
Gillislee, who finished with 140 
yards rushing and two touchdowns, 
left the game on Florida’s second-to-
last offensive possession after suffering 
a rib injury. 
Muschamp said after the game that 
the injury was not serious.

alligator.org.Sugar Bowl, UF’s season is already a 
massive success. 
A team that entered the year with 
a soft reputation and a fringe top-25 
ranking is now solidly No. 5 in the 
nation. 
“We’ve had a fantastic year,” Mus-
champ said. “We have made tremen-dous progress.” 
The Gators got there by taking on 
Muschamp’s hard-nosed personality 
and philosophy.  
Florida won the turnover battle, 
showed resiliency by taking control 
in the fourth quarter, pounded the 
ball in the running game and played 
tough, physical football. 
“It’s a full buy-in, from admin-
istration all the way down,” Mus-
champ said.
Part of that process is always 
pushing for more. 
Muschamp insisted after the game 
that he still wasn’t satisfied, regard-less of the accomplishments of one of 
the most overachieving teams in the 
nation and in school history. 
“We haven’t won a champion-
ship,” Muschamp said. “Until you win a championship, I have a hard 
time saying we’ve arrived and we’re 
back at all.”
But the time for championships will come. Muschamp and Florida 
have laid a foundation on which greatness can be built.  
Doing so required a major rebuild-
ing process. Two years ago, coach Ur -
ban Meyer said Florida was broken. Last season, Muschamp called the Gators soft. Those memories pro-pelled UF’s players to right the ship. 
“We had a lot of hurt in our heart,” 
wideout Quinton Dunbar said.  
Dominique Easley said earlier this 
season that he watched the defen-sive tape from last season’s losses on loop. 
“[Florida State] had to feel the 
same pain that we felt,” Easley said. 
Easley and the Gators inflicted 
that pain, purging their own in the process. The final bad memory has been flushed out. Florida is ready to move forward. 
No one will remember how UF 
played down to its competition in 
wins against Bowling Green, Mis-
souri, Louisiana and Jacksonville 
State. 
Instead, the lasting image will be 
Muschamp soaked in purple with 
his arms raised above his head in 
celebration on the sidelines of Doak 
Campbell Stadium — the image of Florida getting back on top.

111 yards in the fourth quarter.
The Gators ran for 731 yards in five games 
against top-15 opponents. Florida consistently 
finished strong in those games, gaining 43.8 
percent of those yards in the final 15 minutes.
“I saw it on some of the (Florida State) play-
ers’ faces that they were giving up,” Gillislee 
said. “The offensive line [saw] it too.”
No. 5 Florida has played 
with a patchwork offensive 
line for the past six weeks. 
The unit is the healthiest it has 
been since UF played LSU on 
Oct. 6, center Jonotthan Harri-son said on Tuesday.
Florida’s running backs 
reaped the benefits against 
Florida State.
“It was a great thing, man,” Gillislee said. “Especially at a time like this when we re-
ally had to beat Florida State to continue and 
hopefully (make) the national championship at 
the end.”
With No. 1 Notre Dame defeating USC late 
Saturday night, Florida is likely heading to the 
Sugar Bowl on Jan. 2.
The transformation from a soft, barely bowl-
eligible team to a top-five squad built on win-
ning the line of scrimmage has not been quick or easy.
“We’ve worked so hard from January until 
now,” Harrison said. “We’ve worked so hard to get what we’ve earned. I’m proud of the team.”

� FLORIDA LOST 74-58 TO 
ARIZONA STATE ON SUNDAY IN LAS VEGAS. 
PHILLIP HEILMAN
Alligator Writer 
 
Through two games in the South 
Point Thanksgiving Shootout, Carlie 
Needles and Florida feasted on the competition.
On Sunday , the Gators were left 
feeling like turkeys.
Plagued by poor shooting and 
an inconsistent effort on the defen-sive end of the court, Florida (5-2) dropped its final game in Las Vegas, losing 74-58 to Arizona State (2-3) on Sunday . 
After shooting 48.8 percent from 
the field in wins against N.C. State 
and Northern Iowa to begin the 
weekend, UF was limited to just 30.6-percent shooting in the loss. 
Florida’s defense, usually the 
team’s strength, allowed Arizona State to shoot 58.2 percent in the win. 
“Arizona State came to play ,” 
coach Amanda Butler said. “Right 
from the [start], they established 
who the more dominant team was. We fell in line with that, unfortu-nately .” 
After trailing by a double-digit 
margin for most of the game, Florida used a 9-2 run in the second half to pull within 45-37 with 12:52 remain-ing. 
Poor shooting undermined UF’s 
attempt to get any closer.
“We were getting the right shots,” 
Needles said. “We just weren’t fin-ishing them. That was a big part of our loss today .” 
Needles was held to just eight 
points and made only 1 of 5 attempts 
from behind the arc. 
Jennifer George and Jaterra 
Bonds led Florida offensively , as 
each scored 11 points in the loss. But the pair needed 24 shots to score the 22 combined points.
“We weren’t really trying to get 
to the line,” Butler said. “[Arizona State] was doing a great job of stop-ping our dribble penetration. We’re always trying to attack the paint and attack it with the pass, but we weren’t finishing.”
For Butler, UF’s inability to make 
shots was less irritating than its lack of commitment on the defensive end of the floor. 
Arizona State’s Janae Fulcher 
led all scorers with 26 points in 20 minutes. Fulcher helped the Sun Devils outscore the Gators 50-24 in the paint. 
“We made a lot of critical errors, 
and most of them were defensive,” Butler said. 
The loss concludes a brutal 
stretch for the Gators, who played three games in as many days and four games in seven days. Florida went 3-1 during that stretch.
Butler downplayed the effect fa-
tigue had on her team. 
“We have no excuses, because 
Arizona State played two very close 
games preceding this,” Butler said. 
“I’m not sure if it was mental fatigue or poor preparation on our part. I felt like we were ready to play , but we certainly did not come out that way.”
Needles said the three games will 
help the inexperienced Gators pre-pare for the rest of the season. 
Florida does not play again until 
Saturday, when it travels to Michi-gan. 
“We just can’t let other teams 
dictate our game tempo,” Needles said. “When we dictate, that’s when games go our way.”LANDON WATNICK

After sustaining two concussions 
during the preseason, Casey Prather 
tasted blood less than a minute into his 
season debut. 
With 3:08 remaining in the first half, 
Prather took a blow to the jaw as UCF guard Isaiah Sykes drove to the basket. During the collision, one of Prather’s 
teeth punctured his lower lip. The junior 
forward exited the game about a minute later and headed to the locker room to 
have the gash stitched up.
“There was no doubt in my mind, I 
wanted to keep playing,” Prather said.
Wearing a bandage under his lip 
to cover the stitches, Prather returned 
to the game with 14:46 remaining and 
notched eight points as No. 7 Florida 
held off UCF for a 79-66 victory on Fri-day afternoon in the O’Connell Center. 
“It’s like one thing after another with 
this guy,” coach Billy Donovan said. “I feel terrible for him, because if there’s anybody who deserves to be on the 
floor, it’s him. But I was happy that he 
was able to come back in, play and per -
form.”
In 13 minutes against the Knights, 
Prather was 3-of-3 shooting and made both of his free throws. He also grabbed 
four boards and recorded a block. During 
his first play, Prather forced a Knights turnover in the full-court press. 
The 6-foot-6 junior’s most dynamic scoring play occurred with 3:36 left in 
the contest. After receiving a feed from 
junior point guard Scottie Wilbekin, Prather drove down the base line and 
finished with a one-handed reverse 
dunk to put the Gators up by 20.
“That’s what we love him for,” Wil-
bekin said. “He gets the whole team ex-cited when he does stuff like that.”
Prather was hungry to return on Fri-
day after a pair of concussions disrupted his preseason. He suffered his first dur -
ing a scrimmage against Rollins College 
on Oct. 27. His second head injury oc-
curred when junior center Patric Young elbowed him during a rebound attempt 
in practice on Nov. 5. 
“The second one just frustrated me 
even more,” Prather said. “The season was just around the corner when it hap-
pened, so I was pretty upset. … My teammates and my coaches, they kind 
of helped me go through it. They were 
just like, ‘Be patient. It’s better it hap-pen now than later in the middle of the 
season.’”
Prather struggled to avoid turnovers 
and averaged only two points in 9.5 minutes per game last season, but he 
excelled in the postseason. The forward broke out against Virginia in the second 
round of NCAA Tournament on March 
16, scoring 14 points and grabbing four rebounds in the Gators’ 71-45 victory 
against the Cavaliers. 
With Prather’s return and Wilbekin 
back from a three-game suspension, Donovan has a deeper rotation and 
more energy off the bench.
“[Prather] provides intensity,” senior 
guard Kenny Boynton said. “His ath-leticism fuels our team. We’re definitely happy to have him back.”MONDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Gillislee notched 
back-to-back 100-yard games for the first time this season, tallying 140 rushing 
yards and two touchdowns on 24 carries. In the first quarter, he became the first Gator since Ciatrick Fason in 2004 to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a single season.
Filling in for the injured Jelani Jenkins, freshman linebacker Antonio Morrison hit 
FSU quarterback EJ Manuel, forcing a fumble and giving UF the ball early in the fourth quarter. On the next play, Mike Gillislee scored on a 37-yard touchdown run on the next play to put Florida ahead for good.4
A year after posting a minus-three turnover 
margin in a 21-7 loss to the Seminoles, 
the Gators forced five turnovers and had 
one giveaway for a plus-four margin during 
Saturday’s victory. Florida scored 14 points

off from Jeff Driskel and scampered 37 yards to the end zone. The score put the Gators ahead 23-20 and sparked a 24-0 Florida run.
After taking a 6-0 lead, the Gators 
kicked off to the Seminoles in the second quarter. FSU returner Karlos Williams returned the kick 20 yards before UF linebacker Darrin Kitch -
ens forced a fumble. Florida safety 
Jabari Gorman fell on the loose ball, setting up the Gators’ first touchdown drive.Facing third-and-4 in the fourth quarter, Jeff Driskel connected with Quinton Dunbar on a 14-yard touchdown pass, putting Florida ahead 30-20. The touchdown gave the Gators a two-score lead with 
seven minutes to play. The deficit proved too much for the Seminoles to overcome.
Signature win not enough for Gators to earn berth in title game
half,” nose tackle Omar Hunter said. “No 
matter what, (the) second half is our half. We 
got to ﬁ  nish the game in the fourth quarter. 
That is the most important quarter, because you got to ﬁ  nish, and we came out and did 
that.”
  “We knew adversity was going to come, 
and we stayed positive,” cornerback Marcus 
Roberson said. “We know things like that are 
going to happen in the game. We just have to 
ﬁ  ght through every time. It just shows we are 
a tough team, and in the second half, we come 
out strong.”
  Spurred by freshman linebacker Anto-
nio Morrison’s forced fumble on a sack of EJ 
Manuel — the Gators’ ﬁ  fth takeaway of the game — Florida scored 24 straight points in the fourth quarter.
  “The defense was feeding us the ball, and 
we’re so grateful for that,” center Jonotthan 
Harrison said. “Although we couldn’t score 
every offensive possession, the defense just 
kept giving us the ball.”
  After failing to put the game out of hand 
despite multiple opportunities, Florida’s of-
fense ﬁ  nally broke through in the ground 
game, wearing down a unit that entered as 
the nation’s top-ranked rushing defense.
  Mike Gillislee spurred the Gators’ offen-
sive outburst, racking up 63 of his 140 yards 
and a touchdown on his ﬁ  nal ﬁ  ve carries. 
Matt Jones carried six times for 74 yards and a 
touchdown in the fourth quarter alone.
  Like LSU on Oct. 6, Florida State’s vaunted 
defense folded.
  “We had a lot of conﬁ  dence coming in here to be able to run the football,” Muschamp said. “We’ve run it well versus everybody . 
We’ve run it well versus better defenses.”
  The Gators became the ﬁ  fth team in school 
history to win 11 games during the regular 
season and emboldened the SEC brand by 
exposing the likely ACC champions, but Sat-
urday was incomplete.
  Even with one of the nation’s toughest 
schedules, Florida’s margin of error was ra-
zor-thin in 2012. After Saturday’s game, Mus-
champ’s thoughts drifted 167 miles eastward.
  “We shot ourselves in the foot too many 
times in Jacksonville, or we’d be sitting here 
undefeated,” Muschamp said. “We have no 
one to blame but ourselves for not getting it done in Jacksonville. That rests on my shoul-
ders.”
  The Gators have come a long way since coach Urban Meyer called the program “bro-
ken” at the end of the 2010 campaign.
  Eleven wins and a likely berth in the Sugar 
Bowl cannot quell Muschamp’s thirst. Instead 
of playing in Atlanta and Miami to end the 
season, the Gators will watch both games at 
home.
  In Muschamp’s eyes, even an 11-win sea-
son is a failure without a championship.
  “Until you start accomplishing some goals 
— everybody wants to talk about how we’ve 
arrived and we’re back — hell, we haven’t 
won a championship,” Muschamp said. “Un-
til you win a championship, I have a hard 
time saying we’ve arrived and we’re back at 
all. That’s my opinion. Everything at the Uni-versity of Florida is about championships.”
