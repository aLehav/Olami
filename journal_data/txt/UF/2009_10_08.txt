Florida Prepaid College
Plans are not dealing with the
deficits that other state prepaid
plans are facing, according to a
recent New York Times article.
Tom Wallace, the executive
director of the Florida Prepaid
College Board, said in an e-mail
that the plan's trust fund has
managed to hold its own de-
spite the turbulent stock mar-
ket.
Wallace said he credited the
plan's stability to its conserva-
tive investment strategy. The
plan chooses to invest most of
its money in fixed-income se-
curities, which allow funds to"Honestly, college
students need as much
help as we can get

safely weather changing mar-
kets and the passage of time.
Susan James, the director of
external affairs for the Florida
Prepaid College Board, said the
plan allows parents to pay the
cost of tuition, fees and dorm
housing at the time they buy
the plan, rather than at the time
their children attend college.
She said more than 1.4 mil-
lion Florida Prepaid plans havebeen purchased by families
since 1988.
Rebecca Weiss, a sophomore
journalism major, said she has
the Florida Prepaid College
Plan and also receives a full
Bright Futures scholarship.
As Bright Futures faces
changes, the secure state of the
Florida Prepaid College Plan is
reassuring, Weiss said.
"Honestly, college students
need as much help as we can
get money-wise," Weiss said.
According to University
Financial Services, 9,302 UF
students used Florida Prepaid
plans in Fall 2008, and about
$12.5 million was disbursed
to UF students by Florida Pre-
paid.
Two arrested in gun ring
0 THE MEN ARE ACCUSED OF
STEALING TWO FIREARMS.

Two men were arrested Wednesday after po-
lice say they stole firearms last week to sell in a
weapons ring.
Keegan Campbell, 19, and Jesse Renfro, 22,
were named by their accomplice, Bud Williams,
during an interview with police on Oct. 1, accord-
ing to police reports.
On the night of the robbery, which took place
at Brandywine Apartments, 2811 SW Archer
Road, Williams said he drove Campbell and Ren-
fro to the residence and helped them steal a large
metal safe, as well as a laptop, TV and other items
valued at about $2,500.
The men returned to Williams' apartment,where Renfro opened a safe with a power saw
and found two handguns inside, valued at $750,
according to the report.
Williams, a two-time felon, was arrested after
police received a tip that he was selling weapons
from his apartment.
AftercatchingWilliamssell-
ing a shotgun, police searched
his apartment and discovered
nine other firearms: one hand-
gun and a mix of shotguns,
hunting rifles and a full rifle
magazine, the report stated.
Campbell Williams was charged with
11 counts of possession of a
firearm by a convicted felon, one count of armed
burglary and two counts of grand theft from a
dwelling.
Campbell was charged with one count of
armed burglary and one count of possession of a
weapon by a convicted felon. Renfro was charged
with one count of grand theft of a firearm.

Labels etched on fruits
* LASER ETCHING WOULD COST LESS
THAN USING STICKER LABELS.
By JILLIAN KREMER
Alligator Contributing Writer
It won't be long until purchasing fruit at
the grocery store is far from a sticky situa-
tion.
UF researchers are in the final stages of
testing a new system, called laser etching,
which uses light energy to place traceback
information directly on fruit as an alterna-
tive to the sticky adhesive labels usually
used.
Traceback information includes where
the fruit was packaged and sometimes
where it was grown.
Greg Drouillard, a former senior engi-
neering research scientist for the center,
was in Ben Hill Griffin Hall at the center in
1994 when he overheard discussion about
an alternative to the problem of expensive
adhesive labels.
"It gave me something to think about,"
he said. "So I started to come up with ideas
on my own."
One of those ideas became the laser-etch-
ing system. With laser etching, the wave-
length of a laser is set specifically to remove
a fruit or vegetable's pigment, located a few
cell layers deep on the surface of the pro-
duce, as it passes by.
Ed Etxeberria, a professor in the depart-
ment of horticultural sciences at UF, is on
the testing team at the Citrus Research and
Education Center in Lake Alfred, Fla. Hesaid they are testing the new system on a
variety of fruits to see how it affects appear-
ance, rates of decay and water loss.
The results so far have led Etxeberria
to determine that the light actually steril-
izes the treated area, thus eliminating the
growth of decay organisms, yet it allows for
increased dehydration of the fruit.
"At the packinghouse, the label is placed
after the fruit has been washed and waxed,"
he said. "If packers place a second layer of
wax on just the labeled area, now it's sealed
and we avoid all problems."
Etxeberria, along with U.S. Department
of Agriculture microbiolo-
U F gist Jan Narciso and gradu-
Research ate student Preeti Sood, is
now testing for the potential
infiltration of human pathogens. Etxeberria
said the tests are critical, as laser etching is
the only non-removable way to label fruit.
"This system is the only one with perma-
nent traceback," he said. "Before, the stick-
ers could fall off or be switched."
The process also could provide new ad-
vertising methods, allowing companies to
create their unique logos to be placed di-
rectly on the fruit, said Steven Sargent, a
professor of post-harvest pathology at UF.
Drouillard, now the director of laser re-
search and technology for Sunkist Growers
and owner of Laser Applications Technolo-
gies, first released his system in 2005.
Drouillard said the testing should be
completed by the end of October. Once
the FDA approves laser etching, he said
it wouldn't take long before the system is
widely used.t.61f 0ISP7,-nta

Students protest Afghanistan war on 8th anniversary
0 ABOUT 30 PEOPLE ATTENDED.
By MORGAN WATKINS
Alligator Contributing Writer
A crowd of about 30 people rallied on
UF's Plaza of the Americas Wednesday af-
ternoon to call for an end to the war in Af-
ghanistan.
Students stood in the heat and held signs
scrawled with messages about the war, which
had its eighth anniversary Wednesday. The
messages included phrases like "books not
bombs" and "fund schools not war."
The demonstration was set up by sev-eral organizations, including UF Amnesty
International, UF's chapter of Students for a
Democratic Society, Campus CodePINK for
Peace at UF, Human Rights Awareness on
Campus and Islam on Campus at UF.
After the speeches, several students led
a march from the Plaza of the Americas to
Turlington Plaza. As they walked with their
signs held high, they shouted in unison,
"Fund education, not occupation."
Emily Flynn, president of UF Amnesty
International, said in an interview before the
rally that it was important to get the word
out about the harmful effects of militariza-
tion, especially in light of recent talk about
sending more troops to Afghanistan.Justin Wooten, a member of Students for
a Democratic Society who helped organize
the demonstration, said the UF protest was
one of many taking place across dozens of
U.S. campuses Wednesday.
He hoped the rally would make people
think more seriously about
On Afghanistan, especially as the
Campus conflict in Iraq seems to be fad-
ing in prominence.
"People are still focusing
mainly on the economic crisis right now, and
this has everything to do with that," Wooten
said of the war.
He said the money spent on war costs
would be better spent on education, espe-cially in light of the current economic crisis
at the national and state levels.
Paul Ortiz, a UF professor and veteran of
the U.S. military, spoke at the event about his
experiences and the war's impact on people
across the world. He said it was his moral re-
sponsibility to attend the rally.
He also added that it was a personal issue
for him because of his military background
and the experiences of his family members
who have served in Iraq.
"I don't want my family to continue to be
under the constant threat of being killed and
in harm's way," Ortiz said.

protest, visit alligator.org

Editorial
Cross Critics
Desert religious symbol
doesn't cross the line
he U.S. Supreme Court is debating the constitution-
ality of a cross erected in the Mojave National Pre-
serve as a memorial honoring fallen soldiers.
Those who object to the presence of the cross, which is
on government-owned land, say that it violates the first
line of the First Amendment: "Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment of religion."
The cross was built by a local Veterans of Foreign Wars
chapter in 1934.
The fact that the cross is the predominant symbol of
Christianity should not mean that it can't be used as a me-
morial. It does not represent the government's endorse-
ment of one religion over others. It's meant to serve as a
symbol for those who died in foreign wars.
However, people of different faiths should be allowed
to construct their own memorials as well. According to a
CNN article, officials denied a Buddhist group's request to
build a "stupa," or shrine. If officials allow one religious
symbol to stand in the sand, then other groups should
have the same privilege.
Thousands of crosses stand in Arlington National Cem-
etery in honor of soldiers of the Christian faith. Stars of
David honor Jewish veterans. This case should be no dif-
ferent.
If people want to use religious symbols to honor the
dead, then more power to them.
The purpose of the establishment clause is to prevent
the government from being partial to any particular re-
ligion. It doesn't mean that the government should hide
religion from the public eye.
Nasty Nurse
Fort Lauderdalenurse resigned after
she was caught re-
using IV tubing and saline
bags while giving cardiac
stress tests to patients over
the past five years.
It's possible that Qui
Lan, 59, exposed the 1,851
patients she saw to commu-
nicable diseases such as HIV
and hepatitis by not follow-
ing standard hospital proce-
dure and using the one-time
use items as intended, ac-
cording to an article by The
Associated Press.
We cannot think of a rea-
son why Lan, who worked
as a nurse for 37 years be-
fore her resignation, would
fail to consider the safety
of her patients when using
an item labeled as "sterile"
more than once.
Plus, the items she re-
used are inexpensive andvery easy to come by in any
medical facility, especially
a hospital. Saline is nothing
more than a mixture of salt
and water in a plastic bag,
and a 50-pack of 60-inch
IV tubing costs less than
$70 online. And a hospital
like Broward General likely
buys in bulk.
When getting care at a
hospital, there's an assump-
tion of safety and a level of
trust that patients expect.
Lan violated this trust.
Hospital officials reacted
appropriately by contacting
by certified mail the 1,851
patients who came under
Lan's "care" since 2004.
Hopefully, none of the
patients find that they con-
tracted a disease because
of Lan's carelessness. If
someone did, police should
prosecute her to the fullest
extent of the law.

Philly no friend of
n a strange twist of fate, a single city has clumsily
tripped into the epicenter of the debate over animal
cruelty in America. This city has taken a bold stand
in favor of dog fighting on legal and social levels, vol-
untarily placing itself in the line of fire against existing
federal law and overwhelming public opinion.
That this city is Philadelphia should surprise virtu-
ally no one who has ever had the intense pleasure of
traversing the urine-soaked sidewalks of the cheez whiz
capital of the world.
Most commonly called "Filthadelphia," Philly has
taken steps in recent years to make the city even less
hospitable to decent human life. The culmination of
these moves toward cornering the market in disaster
tourism is a pair of anti-dog moves the city finalized
just a few weeks ago.
The Philadelphia Eagles signed quasi-reformed dog
killer Michael Vick to be their third-string quarterback
last month, but not until long after the 3rd District
Court in Philadelphia ruled against federal guidelines
banning the sale and distribution of dog-fighting vid-
eos. The U.S. Supreme Court has just agreed to hear the
appeal to this ruling in its current session, placing the
judgment of the Philadelphia-based 3rd District under
our highest judicial review.
Those of you unfamiliar with the city of Philadelphia
may wonder why a metropolis would freely associate
itself so strongly with such a reprehensible pastime as
pit bull fighting. Those asking such a question probably
have a working knowledge of Philadelphia that centers
on the Liberty Bell and people wearing powdered wigs
to stuffy constitutional conventions. Philly was prob-
ably a great place to live back then, back in the timeman's best friend
before cars and industrialization
and modern medicine.
In order to live in the Philadel-
phia of today, one must have either
an intense self-hatred or a crip-
pling heroin addiction. Other pos-
Tommy Maple sible reasons to live in or aroundletters@alligator org Philly include being under the age
of 12 or over the age of 70, having
a particular affinity for human suffering and/or run-
ning a large drug dealing operation. The requirements
of living in South Philly additionally include at least
two severe emotional and psychological disabilities.
Fans of the Philadelphia Eagles are renowned for
having booed Santa Claus in a December 1968 game and
pegging him with snowballs, but the wanton destruction
of childhood icons in Philly did not end with St. Nick. A
little-known 1987 incident saw the Easter Bunny beaten
and tossed into the lion exhibit at the Philadelphia Zoo
and rumors have spread since late 2006 that the Tooth
Fairy barely fought off a carjacking near Independence
Hall.
The Supreme Court will soon rule one way or an-
other on the relative social value of the images associ-
ated with dog fighting, and Michael Vick will at some
point in the near future run for a touchdown on a snowy
Philadelphia evening.
Each of us will have to sort out how we feel about
these inevitabilities, but some things are ironclad cer-
tainties -your dog wants steak, and it hates Philadel-
phia with a burning passion.

Drivers must become more aware of cyclists
Awoke bloody and in sharp pain at2:25 a.m. on Sept. 4. I couldn't tell you
what city I lived in, what my name was
or what happened.
What I do remember is shoving my
jaw back into place, spitting blood into the
street and watching all the sparkling head-
lights flying past me without hesitating to
see if I was OK. My concussion made the
truth blurry, but from my bruises and bro-
ken bones, it seemed I was clipped by a
vehicle on my bicycle.
My face planted into the asphalt, result-
ing in five mandible and cheek fractures, a
handful of broken ribs and a broken toe.
Luckily, friends saw my zombie-like self
pushing my bike on University Avenue
and rushed me to the North Florida Re-
gional Medical Center to be told the obvi-
ous: "Sir, your body is quite mangled."
The result: Six weeks of a wired jaw
and enough road rash to make "28 Days
Later" look like a B-list movie.
I moved to Gainesville last fall from
Indianapolis and was quite excited to be
submerged in such a vibrant outdoor com-
munity. What I found was a very knowl-
egable bike scene with a completely igno-
rant motorized community. We have the
Gainesville Cycling Club, more bike shopsJohn Phoebus than one can count,
Speaking Out bike messengers,__pak__ng__ut races and a plethora
of bicycle listings on
Craigslist. But there is no awareness about
cyclists when it comes to motorists.
I've been hit a total of three times. Ve-
hicles have run me into the sidewalk five
or six times and have run me off the road
more than I can count in the past year. In
all the close calls and accidents, only one
person stopped -a drunken driver on St.
Patrick's Day who tried to pay me off so I
wouldn't get her arrested.
Most cyclists have been hit: bones bro-
ken, skin raw with road rash and frames
destroyed. Any cyclist will tell you it's a
rare week to not escape death in a town
that prides itself on being open-minded
and environmentally friendly.
Yes, we have bicycle lanes on lots of
roads. But we still need to raise awareness
for cyclists. There is no excuse to have cy-
clists hit, harassed and yelled at, pushed
off their bikes or have beer bottles thrown
at them while cycling; all have happened
to me more than once.
It seems we have forgotten what hap-
pened in 2006. According to police reports,
Welch McNair Bostick III, a UF grad stu-dent, was struck by a vehicle and killed on
Aug. 28. The driver dozed off and ended
Bostick's life. There was an increase in cy-
cling awareness after Bostick passed, but
it seems we forget too easily. I don't want
to see another death or to have Bostick's
death be in vain.
I want my accident to have some ben-
efit to the cyclists in Gainesville and across
the state. If I have to drink all my meals for
six weeks, the community should be learn-
ing from this.
Simple actions from motorists like us-
ing turn signals, looking before turning
and not texting while driving will save
cyclists' lives. We aren't like motorcyclists
who boast loud horns that 'save lives.'
We can't yell over your stereo system. We
can't just use our bumpers to keep us safe
or our seatbelts to keep us from flying over
your windshield. Most of us are doing this
for health, for the environment, for logical
transport. Motorists, watch out for cyclists.
You never know -that cyclist could be
the guy bringing you your sub "freaky
fast," or the environmentalist who's sav-
ing our planet, or your economics profes-
sor. Be grateful for us.

Letter to the Editor
Burger King should keep it tacky
As I read the editorial about Burger King's
imminent extreme makeover, I became con-
siderably miffed. When I go into B, the last
words I want to cross my mind are "upscale,
hip, and edgy."
Burger King, let me save you some time
and money here. Stop with the fancy inte-
rior designing and lavish chandeliers. We're
already in the place, and we know full well
what we're getting into.
If I wanted to go to a trendy restaurant, I'd
go to whatever chic eatery was featured on
the latest episode of "The Hills."
Not to mention Starbucks has had the
pseudo-sophisticated crowd covered for a
while now.
Embrace your tackiness, Burger King. It's
grown charming over the years. I think your
biggest competitor shops the Pottery Barn
dollar menu for its decor anyway.
That being said, you can take your ambi-
ence and fry me a river, Burger King. Just let-
tuce know when you've mustard the sense
to get back to your roots, so we can relish in
familiarity and ketchup with an old friend.

Phones collected
for abuse victims
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF's Family Law Society is
trying to make sure that every
call for help can be heard.
October is National Domestic
Violence Awareness Month, and
the organization is collecting cell
phones and chargers to donate to
victims of domestic violence so
they can call 911 during an emer-
gency.
The "Call Out Against Domes-
tic Violence" drive will run until
Oct. 29, and the collection box is
in the lobby of the Levin College
of Law Library.
Family Law Society President
Kelly Damerow, a second-year
law student at the Levin College
of Law, said the drive is part of
an effort to get the organization
involved in the community.
It is the first time the group
has held a cell phone drive.
"We hope to make it annual,"
she said.
According to rules set by the
Federal Communications Com-
mission, all wireless service pro-
viders must transmit 911 calls re-
gardless of whether the caller is a
subscriber or not.
This way, even if an old cell
phone is disconnected, it can stillcall 911.
The idea for the project came
from second-year law student
Jennifer Marks, secretary of the
Family Law Society.
"It was something I was pas-
sionate about," she said.
"Whatever you can donate
will help."
Jennifer Marks
Secretary, UF Family Law Society
While taking a summer class
dedicated to domestic violence,
she learned that victims often
don't have ways to call for help
because of financial reasons or
controlling partners.
"We're really just trying to
educate," she said.
All of the donated cell phones
and chargers will go to Peace-
ful Paths, an organization that
provides shelter and other ser-
vices for domestic abuse victims
in Alachua, Bradford and Union
counties.
The collection started Monday,
and as of Wednesday afternoon,
Marks said they had received five
cell phones and seven chargers.
"Whatever you can donate
will help," she said.

Domestic partners eligible for spouse Gators tickets
By KATIE KLOSS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Thanks to a change in policy,
the domestic partners of UF stu-
dents will now be able to get
spouse tickets for Gator games.
Spouse tickets cost the same as
student tickets, which are usually
cheaper than general admission.
The University Athletic As-
sociation changed its policy last
week, according to UAA spokes-
man Steve McClain.The UAA's old policy required
students who wanted to purchase
spouse tickets to submit a valid
marriage certificate to the Gator
Ticket Office, according to Gator-
Zone.com.
Under the new policy, UF Stu-
dent Legal Services determines
spouse eligibility.
Gator 1 Central then issues the
spouse cards used to purchase
tickets.
McClain wrote in an e-mail
that anyone with a valid Gator 1spouse card "shall be eligible to
purchase single-game and post-
McClainHseason football
tickets and men's
basketball sin-
gle-game tickets
in accordance
with standard
UF student tick-
et policies for
those events."
Whitney Blake, Pride Stu-
dent Union's vice president of
outreach, wrote in an e-mailthat the old policy was "dis-
criminatory and unacceptable."
"We are as much a part of the
Gator Nation as any other stu-
dent, faculty, or staff here at the
University of Florida," Blake
wrote.
McClain stated the policy
change occurred after the UAA
consulted with Student Legal
Services but did not answer ques-
tions about what prompted the
change.
The policy change goes intoeffect immediately, according to
McClain.
Blake wrote that Pride Student
Union is happy about the change
but believes "it should not have
been an issue in the first place."
Ryan Johnson-Travis, a UF
grad student studying acting, is
also happy about the change.
"I think this is an incredible
opportunity for the university to
show the world at large that love
is love, regardless of what it looks
like," Johnson-Travis said.
New Santa Fe College concert band to debut tonight
0 ABOUT 30 STUDENTS WILL
PERFORM IN THE BAND.
By ALEX CHACHKEVITCH
Alligator Staff Writer
Santa Fe College's new concert band,
the Santa Fe Winds, will kick off its debut
season tonight with its first performance.
About 30 Santa Fe students will pre-
miere with eight instrumental pieces, said
Chris Sharp, Santa Fe's director of instru-
mental music and conductor for the band.The program will include works by Ralph
Vaughan Williams, Cecile Chaminade and
James Vincent, as well as two pieces writ-
ten by Sharp.
Santa Fe first-year music student Dylan
King, who will be performing "Flute Con-
certino" by Chaminade, said he is excited
about the debut.
King said he enjoys playing for an audi-
ence and that he is not nervous because he
performed the same piece when he was in
his high school band.
"They're going to be terrific for their
first time," Sharp said, adding that bandhas been practicing since the beginning of
Fall semester.
The performance will also feature guest
conductor Johnny Egan, an SFC sopho-
more, who will direct "Lyric Overture" by
Frank Erickson.Santa Fe Ensemble members getCollege college credit for their work.
Santa Fe offers the concert
band class to anyone who is interested
and has previous experience with instru-
ments.
But this will be the first time Santa Fe
will have its own performing band -San-ta Fe Winds.
"We now have enough students to have
our own ensemble," Sharp said, adding
that the class previously collaborated with
the Gainesville Community Band.
He said SFC is just starting its music
program, but it is already offering a range
of music classes.
Students could not pursue degrees in
music previously at Santa Fe.
Admission to the concert is free and
will be held in the college's E Auditorium.
The group's second performance is sched-
uled for Dec. 1.

UF ACADEMICS
'Nano' course examines technology's impact on jobs
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Staff Writer
kbein@alligator org
What futuristic discovery could
create about two million jobs and
is smaller than the dust collecting
on your textbooks?
The answer is nanoparticles,
and UF is working to educate peo-
ple on their importance with a new
one-credit class.
Nano for the Rest of Us -EMA
4935 for undergraduates and EMA
6938 for graduate students -is
designed to put students and fac-
ulty from different disciplines to-
gether to learn from one another
and figure out how nanotechnol-
ogy is going to change the world
for the better.
"It has potential that is unthink-
able today," said Brij Moudgil, the
engineering professor who started
the class last summer with co-
creators Bill Appleton and Rodney
Guico.
Moudgil said he got the idea
during his years of research at UF.
Once he began to understand
the scope of the technology, which
has applications from biomedicine
to the environment, he decided
there should be a class aimed at
non-engineering students.
He said it doesn't matter whatstage of study a student is in be-
cause the point is communication.
The class meets once a week,
and each meeting features a pro-
fessor from a different college who
talks about how nanotechnology
relates to his or her field of work,
its opportunities and the questions
being raised with each discovery.
The questions include ethical is-
sues that must be faced when doc-
tors are able to send nanobots into
a patient's bloodstream to fight
viruses or infections and how the
media will inform the public about
advancements and color the way
society views these achievements.
Although the issues are impor-
tant and can't be faced by research-
ers alone, Moudgil said, students
shouldn't be intimidated.
"You don't have to be a mad
scientist or even know anything
about nanotechnology to do well
and appreciate this course," he
said.
"We want students to have
fun," he said. "If you have fun,
hard work is really not hard work,
and you must have hard work to
reach excellence."
Lisa Ferrera, a third-year mate-
rials engineering student, is taking
the course and said she found the
class when she was looking for a
one-credit course.Y

Badgley branches out with new role in horror flick
By LANE NIESET
avenue editor
Dan Humphrey and Michael Harding
have one thing in common: They are both
outcasts.
Penn Badgley, who plays Dan Humphrey
in the hit series "Gossip Girl," is branching
out with his role in the movie "The Stepfa-
ther," which opens in theaters Oct. 16.
In the film, Badgley plays the role of
Michael, who returns home from military
school and finds his mother living with her
new boyfriend. Michael is suspicious of his
mother's boyfriend, who he thinks might
have appeared on "America's Most Wanted."
Badgley said the film is different from
other horror movies because it is obvious
who the killer is from the first scene, unlike a
game of Clue when the audience is guessing
who the killer could be.
"This is a broader thriller," he said during
a Monday conference call with college media
outlets. "I think there's more of a story that
will draw you in and keep you invested asopposed to relying on gimmicks."
Because the audience already knows who
the killer is, the film has to end in a battle
between the stepson and stepfather, he
said.
"The Stepfather" is a remake of a 1987
thriller that featured a stepdaughter instead
of a stepson.
"I think they changed that to make the
relationship between the stepfather and my
character to be one where you can only see
one of two ways for it to end, and that's prob-
ably one of them dying," he said during the
conference call.
To prepare for the role, Badgley did push
ups, pull ups, practiced screaming and any-
thing to let the "blood rush to his head," he
said. Badgley would try to "exhaust himself
to make it seem real" during scenes when
the killer is chasing him through the house,
he said.
"In order to make it [real] you have to re-
ally amp yourself up," he said.
He also did some of his own stunts, which
he has never had to do in his previous roles."I have the bruises and scrapes to prove it,"
he said.
Badgley was attracted to the part of the
stepson because it was a different type of
role and experience, he said.
One of Badgley's most memorable experi-
ences on the set was when the actors shot a
sequence that takes place
outside on a rooftop with
movie rain, which is really
heavy so it will show up on
camera.
The three days they
shot it were the only three
days the temperature was
below 50 degrees in L.A.
He was wearing a thin cot-
ton T-shirt and jeans and
was soaked the whole time.
Although he said it was close to "un-
bearable" at the time, he said he learned a
lot throughout the process of filming a big
picture.
Badgley said making the transition from
television to film branching was "seamless.""It was a very natural progression," he
said. "It wasn't so much that I was really con-
scious of changing from one role to another."
He said one of the main differences is
that in a television series you have many
chances to get the moment right, but in a
film there is only one chance.
After his role as Dan in "Gossip Girl," he
said this film was an "interesting next step."
"I think Michael, who is the kid in 'The
Stepfather,' comes from a very different
place I think mentally, emotionally than
Dan," Badgley said. Michael's character is
"less confident in his own skin," whereas,
Dan is comfortable being alienated.
He said he identifies with Michael more
because Michael has problems, unlike Dan
who is "pretty ordinary in most ways."
To prepare for the role as Michael, he had
to act like he's never seen a horror film and
"find something real" to compel him, he said.
"I think it was a surprising task doing this
movie," Badgley said. "It was difficult."!

It appears the month of September
was one of interruptions with celebrities
and politicians both acting like 6-year-
olds in the grocery store.
You may have heard the echo of
two worldwide "Aww hell naww"'s last
month as Kanye West and Joe Wilson
made asses of themselves by disrupt-
ing widely televised gatherings.
After ruining the biggest moment of
Taylor Swift's entertainment career to
essentially proclaim his love for Beyon-
c6, the aviator-faced West managed to
tweet up a rather backhanded apology
to Swift.
"I'M SOOOOO SORRY," the all-caps
Twitter post read. But West, being the
pompous jerk he is, followed up with
"EVERYBODY WAN NA BOOO ME BUT
I'M A FAN OF REAL POP CULTURE!!!"
Double dissing T-Swizzle? He may
as well have kicked a puppy. Oh well, all
publicity is good publicity, right? Wrong
Then we have our second in this re-
curring theme of butting in. Wilson re-
ceived his 15 minutes of fame through
stupidity. Granted, President Barack
Obama and Nancy Pelosi's faces were
priceless. Pelosi looked like she wanted
to drop kick him off her lectern.
Speaking of people who the worldcares far too much about, Pete Wentz,
of Fall Out Boy, got a new haircut, which
made national news for some reason.
He got rid of his emo bangs -good
for him. Maybe now he can expand his
fan base to women instead of seventh-
grade girls. Seriously, I wish everyone
got this much attention for making the
transition to look like a normal human
being.
And just when we thought Holly-
wood was becoming boring again with
the death of Michael
Jackson -surprise!
Roman Polanski is
keeping it the same
deranged place we
all know and love. It
seems like everyone
in Hollywood has
come to his defense
with a flimsy petition.
What about raping a 13-year-old do
these people not understand? More
importantly, why do they think anyone
is going to give a crap about their peti-
tion?
I guess they think President Obama
is going to look at the petition and say,
"Oh, well WoodyAllen doesn't approve. I
guess we shouldn't go through with it."
Hollywood stars thinking they know
what's best in politics: Ridiculous.

Imagine growing up without
being able to find Waldo or wish-
ing you had Matilda's magic pow-
ers.
In some places, avid child
readers could have faced this
childhoodtwithout imagination
because these books have been
contested and removed from li-
brary shelves.
UF's Baldwin Library of Histori-
cal Children's Literature exhibit,
Banned and Controversial Books
from 1990 to 2008, features
titles that parents and school offi-
cials have deemed taboo, making
them forbidden material for some
young eyes.
"I really don't think there's a
valid reason to take a book off a
shelf," said Rita Smith, curator
of the Baldwin Library. "All books
should be freely accessible."
Smith said although children's
books have always been con-
tested, parents started contesting
more books in the 1980s as the
content began dealing with diffi-
cult issues."Some reasons are pretty sil-
ly," said Smith, referring to books
such as "Where's Waldo?" which
is contested for featuring a par-
tially exposed woman in the maze
of people while Waldo is at the
beach, and Shel Silverstein's po-
etry collection "A Light in the Attic"
for giving children the idea that by
breaking plates, they won't have
to do the dishes. "But others are
pretty serious," she said.
In the second edition of
"Where's Waldo?" published in
1997, 10 years after the original,
the exposed woman was redrawn
wearing a bikini top.
Books like "Go Ask Alice," the
1971 cult classic and one of the
first novels to come out of the
drug era, and Mark Twain's "The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"
a popular high school reading
requirement, are still contested
even after years on the market.
The display, which runs
through Nov. 4, offers students an
understanding of issues that go
on behind the scenes at libraries
that can take a book off the shelf
and into the dark.

Blogging helps career, creates networking opportunities
By MOLLY BRUCE
avenue contributing writer
Jenny Demartini will intern at the
national nonprofit March of Dimes in
the spring, and it is partially thanks
to her blog.
She said the women who hired
her said her blog proved she can
write so that people would be inter-
ested.
"I've only written about 10 posts,
and it's already made such an im-
pact," she said.
Demartini, a journalism student
at UF, is just one example of how
blogging can help your career.
Blog expert Susan Gunelius
started blogging to create a plat-
form for her first book, "Harry Pot-
ter: The Story of a Global Business
Phenomenon."
"I think a blog can really help
anyone," Gunelius said.
If you're interested in starting
your own blogto further your career,
check out these easy tips from ex-
perts:
Get the Right Site
The amount of blogging Web
sites can be daunting. Fortunately,
experts recommend one site more
than any other: WordPress.com.
"If you want to do big things, you
should use WordPress," Guneliussaid.
With its customizable features,
widely used widgets, thousands of
theme options and easy-to-follow
guides, WordPress is great for be-
ginners and experts, Gunelius said.
It is also free.
Write Something Interesting
-Correctly
Gunelius suggested picking
somethingyou are interested in that
you also have authority in.
"You need to establish that
you're the expert," she said.
Niche blogging is good, she said.
For example, blogging about food is
general, but blogging about baking
cookies is a niche blog.
Mindy McAdams, an online jour-
nalism professor at UF, said to de-
cide whether you want the blog to
Pi

Web site like
WordPress.com.fa
arbe more personal or professional in
the beginning.
"(College students) could mix
them gracefully, or they could con-
trol themselves and stick to one
topic," McAdams said.
Keep a clear focus in mind, she
said, and you should end up with
good content.
"You want a blog that you could
show to someone who's going to
give you a job or an internship," she
said.
Both experts agree that posts
should stick to 300 words with a few
updates a week.
"That's easy enough for anyone
to read without getting bored," Mc-
Adams said.
When in doubt, go shorter, she
said, because "it will always be bet-
ter if you cut stuff out."McAdams cautioned students
about grammar, spelling and punc-
tuation mistakes. Blogs are clearly
your own writing, it's important to
show potential employers that you
can write correctly, she said.
Writing in a Microsoft Word docu-
ment and using the spell check fea-
ture is a great way to avoid making
mistakes.
"(It could) hurt you more than
help you if there are careless er-
rors," she said.
Extend Your Network
To promote your blog, you first
have to support other blogs.
"Do a lot of reading," Gunelius
said.
Google.com/trends, a free site,
shows the most searched words

AdSense or

L.
Jessica Warshaver/ A IIigator Staff"You should always blog with
keywords in mind," she said.
Commenting on blogs with your
URL is another way to bring in new
readers, McAdams said.
Include hyperlinks in your blog
posts to create more traffic, too,
she said.
You Can Make Money, Too!
Once your blog gets rolling, it will
move up the search lists. A popular
blog is more impressive to employ-
ers, and the more hits your site
gets, the more advertisers will be
interested in your site.
Google AdSense, a free program,
allows bloggers to displays ads re-
lating to their content. Google will
send you a check for the revenue
your blog generates, McAdams
said.
The free WordPress site cannot
have advertising as of now, accord-
ing to WordPress.com, but it will be
available in the future.
Another money-maker is Tip Jar,
a free service done through Pay-
Pal, which allows readers to donate
money by clicking a button.
Blogging can create all kinds
of networking opportunities. Don't
be afraid to start, even if you write
about your socks at first. As McAd-
ams said, "It's your blog."

* Tokio Hotel
"Humanoid"
German glam-rock
heroes Tokio Hotel have
made a name for them-
selves writing emo-in-
fused choruses dubbed
over pop-rock-ish guitar riffs. The English
version of their latest release, "Humanoid,"
is no different. The record's first single, "Au-
tomatic," will have tweens around the globe
bouncing to its infectious choral hook.-. Backstreet Boys
"This Is Us"

phenomenon that is
Auto-tune and peppered their gushy love
lyrics with drum machines that sound like
they were pulled straight from Lady Gaga's

Us" is more nostalgic than anything else.Air
"Love 2"
Fully electronic and
fully eclectic from begin-
ning to end, "Love 2" is
by far this week's funkiest
release. Throw on some
headphones and see if
you can catch the ambient rainforest sounds
creeping their way into a track or two. The re-
freshingly down-tempo stylings of the French
electro-duo's ninth release are as soothing
as they are entertaining. "Love 2" is definitely
worth a listen.Brandi Carlile
"Give Up the Ghost"
Brandi Carlile's third
release mixes soulful
acoustic ballads with
alt-rock tracks that
make it a well-balanced
album overall. From past to present, "Give
Up the Ghost" will appeal to fans of Johnny
Cash, Sara Bareilles and The Killers alike.
Sex in a different city offers welcome relief, adventure
By BRANDT WILLIAMS
avenue writer
Despite the fact that we attend a
universitywith nearly50,000 students,
Gainesville is not a metropolitan haven
thatyou can have anonymous sex with
a stranger who you'll never see again.
Rather, I'd argue that you might have
difficulty swinging a weight at South-
west Recreation Center without knock-
ing over two people you've previously
"exercised" with. The solution? Pack,
make for the border (of another state)
and indulge in a weekend vacation.
Uncharted cities offer an abun-
dance of well-heeled and well-groomed
20-somethings, all in their sexual
prime and refreshingly unaware ofyour previous sexual conquests. When
you're as unfamiliar with a city's popu-
lation as you are its geography, you'll
never have the displeasure of saving
someone's phone number onlyto real-
ize that it was already stored in your
contact list.
Regarding the magnitude of the
city you wish to stay in, size always
matters -New York or Chicago will
surely measure up. Singles in these
cities have a mysteriously attractive
air about them, from the dressed-for-
sexcess executive to the 40-year-old
cougar strutting down the street (sans
wedding ring). Emboldened by the re-
ality that you don't know these people,
it's easy to approach them without
fear of rejection.
Stopping at Dior, you search forBrandt Williams
Columnistsomething to
wear out for
the night's
dep ravity.
You strike up
a conversa-
tion with the
sales associ-
ate about the
city's trendiest
bars, and al-
though you don't leave with the perfect
apparel, you do leave with the sales
associate's phone number. After all,
that particular associate seemed very
eager to service you, and he or she
could be more fun out during the mid-
night hours.
Waiting for the subway, you spy a
cute urbanite. Flirtatiously ask himor her for directions since "you don't
know where you are," and pretty soon
he or she is escorting you home (cau-
tion: there's a very fine line between
acting lost and acting stupid. Never
attempt the latter.).
Finding a potential hookup buddy
at a club is even easier. It's like shoot-
ing fish in a barrel or getting an A in
Wildlife Issues in a Changing World.
You step out with confidence to the
new hot spot and notice a stud whose
hungry eyes are giving you the thrice-
over. Before you can point and say
"Mine!" Studly is already parting the
crowd to introduce himself.
After a couple Blow Job shots, your
sticky bodies are melting together on
the dance floor, and you're passion-
ate about tonight's prey. Since you'renot in Gainesville, you haven't heard
rumors as to the measurements of
his disco stick or whether she spits or
swallows, but you'll be damned if you
don't find out by night's end. You hail
a taxi, go back to his or her place and
engage in the wildest sex of your life
with a lover who you simply don't have
to love.
Your only concerns should be about
not getting attached and the possibil-
ity of another go-round if you visit the
city again. But just remember, when
taking candy from strangers, they're
exactly that -strangers. You can nev-
er trust a ho, so wrap it up. As long as
you avoid the tourist traps of an STD or
stolen kidney, one can practically write
these foreign escapades off as a nec-
essary "travel expense."by RICHARD IWANIK-MARQUES full reviews available at alligator.org/the avenue

pleasing addition to a room, HyerY
Where to begin:
Discover your style. Take time
to brainstorm which colors and
patterns interest you, said Nancy
Hyer, interior decorator at Stage-
works Home Staging & Redesign.
Feel free to explore. Whether it's
modern, contemporary, vintage or
feng shui, expose yourself to the
many mediums of expression. You
can draw from these when creating
your own individual style. This will
open your eyes to the choices that
are available, she said.
Find a focal point:
After deciding on a vision for
your space, find a piece of furniture
(typically a sofa) to be the main fo-
cal point or place where the eye is
drawn to first.
Don't start by paintingthe walls,
said Sara Freeborn, an interior
decorator at Interior Associates of
Gainesville. Painting will limit the
variety of colors that can be added
to the room.
Be thrifty:
Visit thrift stores, antique shops,
garage sales or Goodwill to find ec-
centric, unique or quirky features
to add to your home.
"I think it adds a lot of characterHomemade headboards:
Cut a pattern out of a large
piece of plywood and hang it be-
hind a bed. You can also use folding
screens to create a pattern to add
distinction and texture. Hang four
or five window shutters vertically
in a row to create a more dramatic
effect. Paint and decorate them to
match your color scheme.
Furniture with color and
class:
Keeping base furniture (couch-
es, armchairs, love seats, reclin-
ers) neutral and simple will allow
you to have freedom when chang-
ing d6cor in the future, Hyer said.
Neutral colors are versatile and will
save you from buying new furniture
later.
But adding color to other pieces
such as coffee tables, dressers or
end tables can update a room. Use
spray paint to give a piece a new
look. Any color will work, but you
can't go wrong with dark browns
and blacks because they hide im-
perfections, Hyer said.
To add a little character to a
piece, try applying sandpaper to
the surface and edges.
For a coffee table in a league of
its own, you can glue mirror tilessaid. Glue on mirror tiles, paint it
or staple fabric to itto create a wall
hanging that is sure to catch the
eye.
For cost-savvy alternatives to
buying an expensive premade
painting in a frame, buy a ready-
made canvas and staple fabric to
it. If your creative juices are flow-
ing, try painting your own work of
art. It doesn't have to be fancy. A
simple abstract design will do just
fine.
An even more cost-effective op-
tion is obtaining wood, any size or
shape, to paint and hang on your
wall. This strategy is one that UF
interior design graduate Sereen
Gualtieri uses in her own home. "I
like the way the acrylic paint looks
on it," she said.
The wood is already a natural
brown color, which Gualtieri says
makes the paint colors richer than
they would be on canvas. She
scouts out free wood that people
are throwing away, either on the
side of the road or at a recycling
center. When she wants wood piec-
es that are the same size, she goes
to Lowe's because they cut the
wood for free.

OL Patchan will miss rest of season after torn ACL
By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer
pkegler@alligator org
Offensive lineman Matt
Patchan tore his right ACL and
will miss the rest of the season.
Florida coach Urban Meyer
revealed Wednesday that the in-
jury occurred in non-contact in-
dividual drills during Tuesday's
practice.
The sophomore had been a key
part of the offensive line rotation,
appearing in all four games this
season behind starting left tackle
Carl Johnson.
Offensive line coach Steve
Addazio said Mike and Maurkice
Pouncey could step in at the posi-
tion if needed.
"It hurts. That's a tough deal,
especially for Matt," Meyer said.
"Matt's been injury-prone. He
was coming into his own a little
bit, playing and starting and get-
ting a lot of action."
Patchan came to Gainesville as
five-star recruit on the offensive
line, but he played 11 games at
defensive tackle in 2008 to help
Florida's depth. He missed the fi-nal three games of last season due
to a torn MCL in his left knee. In
the spring, Patchan moved back
to offense but missed the early
part of practice due to a left leg
injury sustained in a scooter ac-
cident.
Meyer said Florida will apply
for a medical redshirt for Patchan.
If granted, he would have three
years of eligibility remaining.
"Our prayers are with Matt,"
Meyer said. "That was a tough
deal."
"Matt's been injury-prone.
He was coming into his
own a little bit, playing
and starting and getting a
lot of action."
Urban Meyer
UF football coach
INJURY UPDATE: Junior cornerback
Moses Jenkins (concussion) will
miss Saturday's game. Defensive
tackle Lawrence Marsh (ankle)
practiced Wednesday, and Meyer
said he is probable to play. He
has only played in one game so
far this season (Tennessee).'.1w

Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff
UF offensive lineman Matt Patchan tore his right ACL and will miss the remainder of the season. He will
apply for a medical redshirt, which could give him three more years of eligibility.
Tebow likely game-time call
0 MEYER SAID UF IS PREPARING TO
PLAY WITH AND WITHOUT HIM.
By MIKE DIFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator org
Whether ornot Florida quarterbackTim Tebow
is cleared to play against No. 4 LSU on Saturday
could be a game-day decision.
UF coach Urban Meyer said Wednesday that a
decision would likely not be made "until the foot
hits the ball", but the Gators' medical staff has ad-
vised him to prepare as if Tebow will play.
"I think that this will be a decision not made
today," Meyer said. "After yesterday's practice, I
was told to game plan with the intent that there's
a chance that Tim could play. That's all I know.
All the other stuff .we'll make a decision as we
get closer."
LSU's Tiger Stadium, also known as Death
Valley, is one of the loudest home environments
in college football, and the noise inside Tiger Sta-
dium might be a determining factor in whether
the Heisman Trophy winner plays.
"If the noise bothers Tim, he won't be in the
game. It means he's still symptomatic (from theconcussion)," Meyer said.
Tebow underwent further testing and prac-
ticed again Wednesday but has still not been
medically cleared to play in a game.
Meyer dispelled the notion that waiting to an-
nounce Tebow's status would give the Gators a
competitive advantage because the Tigers would
have to prepare for two different quarterbacks.
"Is it an advantage, us not telling?" Meyer
said. "I'm not worried about that right now. We're
game-planning as if there's a chance Tim could
play. There's a chance he won't
play.",
Tebow practiced for the first
time Tuesday since suffering the
Football first concussion of his career Sept.
26 against Kentucky.
Experts have advised Meyer to
slowly reintroduce Tebow to contact starting with
a few light shots to his chest in a test-like proce-
dure.
Meyer said Tebow played against the defense
for the first time Wednesday and was "pushed
around a little bit," but Meyer does not plan to
subject him to any more intense contact before
Saturday's game.
SEE TEBOW, PAGE 24Meyer should start Brantley
ometime during the nextfew days, Urban Meyer will
stop for a second and realize
something.
He is about to make one of the
biggest decisions of his nine-year
head coaching career.
When Florida takes the field for
its first offensive possession Satur-
day night at LSU in loud and rau-
cous Tiger Stadium, who will run
onto the field as quarterback?
Medical officials will have the
first call to make, but it appears as
if Tim Tebow is doing well on the
road to recovery after his concus-
sion in the Kentucky game. He has
practiced the last two days.
Any decision about Tebow's sta-
tus for the LSU game isn't expected
to come until justbefore kickoff, and
Meyer has said a medical clearance
will not automatically equate to
Tebow playing.U

"I've never seen the attention

many, many people involved with

SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE
Vandy's Johnson knows impact of celebration penalties
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmcca ll@a Iligator org
When Vanderbilt coach Bobby Johnson
read about the excessive celebration penalty
that led to Georgia's late loss against LSU last
week, he felt the Bulldogs' pain.
In 2005 at Florida, VU receiver Earl Ben-
nett was penalized after a touchdown catch
with less than a minute left, a flag that kept
the Commodores from attempting a two-
point conversion to take the lead.
Forced to kick an extra point to tie the
score, Johnson's squad went on to lose to the
Gators in double overtime, and the experi-
ence has left him wanting a change in how
the penalty is handled.
"We have to have that rule," Johnson said.
"It will get beyond control if we don't have it.
I think a way we could control it is to have the
referee have the ability to veto it. If the back
judge or side judge throws the flag and [the
referee] disagrees, have him veto the call."
The call against Georgia came after receiv-
er A.J. Green's go-ahead touchdown catch
with just over a minute to go.
Green was mobbed by teammates in
the end zone and was penalized under the
NCAA's unsportsmanlike conduct rule,
which forbids players from "attempts to fo-
cus attention upon himself (or themselves),"
meaning choreographed celebrations, taunt-
ing, jumping into the stands and spiking,
throwing, kicking or spinning the ball.
Except Green didn't do any of the above.
In fact, Rogers Redding, the Southeastern
Conference's coordinator of football officials,
apologized for the call Monday.
The apology was too little, too late, as the
yardage gave LSU great field position on theensuing kickoff, and the Tigers notched the
winning score with 46 seconds to play.
There's no doubt that the penalty changed
the dynamics of the game, and it has led to
calls for the NCAA to revise the rule and
make it easier to enforce.
"I'm like these other coaches saying re-
write the thing to take the judgment out ofit," UF coach Urban Meyer said. "I do believe
there should be a penalty for excessive cel-
ebration or you do something that's not good
for college football, but that kid from Geor-
gia made one of the greatest catches I have
ever seen to take the lead against LSU, and he
went crazy celebrating with his teammates. I
don't understand that call."
Georgia wide receiver A.J. Green (8) celebrates with teammates after catching a
touchdown pass late in the fourth quarter against LSU on Oct. 3.SPURRIER WEIGHS IN ON BOWDEN: After a
2-3 start to the season and an 0-2 mark in
conference play, FSU coach Bobby Bowden
has faced heat from boosters urging him to
retire, but university president T.K. Wether-
ell said Wednesday that Bowden's job is not
in jeopardy.
South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier took
verbal jabs at the Seminoles pretty frequently
when he was at Florida, but he's not going to
kick Bowden while he's down.
"It's a tough thing, it really is," Spurrier
said. "We wish it didn't happen to coaches
near the end of their careers. But if you look
at the history of coaching, it happens all the
time to coaches that have had tremendous
wonderful careers, and if they are still there
later on and not winning, this is what hap-
pens."
Spurrier added that all is not lost for FSU
just yet.
"They could still turn it around," he
said. "They've got great players there at
FSU. I think they could turn it around
and still have a wonderful season."
CHIZIK SEES MALZAHN AS FUTURE HEAD
COACH: No. 17 Auburn has gotten off to a
shockingly good 5-0 start, and the Tigers are
in the nation's top five for rushing, total and
scoring offense per game, as well as turnover
margin and sacks allowed.
First-year head coach Gene Chizik credits
offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn, formerly
at Arkansas and Tulsa, for playing a big role
in the turnaround.
"Gus is really good at what he does,"
Chizik said. "(Head coaching) is certainly
down the path for him, and it's something he
aspires to."
Will, Embree win to advance to ITA All-American main draw
* THE DUO QUALIFIED TO PLAY IN
DOUBLES DRAW AS WELL.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
Three days ago, only one of the 48 available
spots in the ITA All-American singles tourna-
ment was held by a UF player. Now, after go-
ing a combined 11-1 in two days of qualifying,
that number is up to three.In singles play, Allie Will and Lauren Em-
bree will be joining No. 3 seed Marrit Boonstra
in the main draw after each cruised to their
third victory in two days.
Embree's 7-6 (4), 6-0 victory over No. 46
Catherine Newman of Vanderbilt was Em-
bree's fifth straight victory over a ranked op-
ponent. Embree went down 5-3, but a quick
change enabled her to take the first set before
coasting through the second.
"She's always looking to attack, but the kid
she was playing is such a great counter punch-er so it wasn't working and she had to change
it up," associate head coach Dave Balogh said.
Will blew out No. 37 Andrea Remynse
of UCLA 6-2, 6-4. This win
brings Will to 10-1 this sea-
son, with eight wins against
W ranked foes.Women S Embree and Will also
Tennis made it into the main doubles
draw with an 8-3 victory over
Amanda Craddock and Krista Damico of Tex-
as and an 8-5 victory over Shinann Featherstonand Katrina Tsang of North Carolina.
The only loss on the day belonged to the
team of Boonstra and Joanna Mather, who
were upset 8-5 by Joyce Ardies and Denise Dy
of Washington.
Still, UF's three players in the singles draw
ties USC for the most of any school.
"It's awesome any time you can get three
players in the main draw of the All-Ameri-
can," Balogh said. "As long as we keep getting
better and keep doing the right things the up-
side for this team is really promising."

Murphy's triple-double leads UF
0 THE SOPHOMORE LOGGED HER
FOURTH OF THE YEAR IN A FOUR-SET WIN.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
Playing on national TV for the first time this year,
Kelly Murphy didn't shy away from the spotlight.
The sophomore setter notched her NCAA-best
fourth triple-double of the season as No. 6 Florida
(12-2, 6-1 Southeastern Conference) took down
South Carolina 3-1 (24-26,25-19,25-23,25-15) in Co-
lumbia on Wednesday night in a match shown on
ESPNU.
"In some ways with Kelly, we just don't get her
enough balls," UF coach Mary Wise said. "She had
it going tonight."
Murphy recorded her 10th career triple-double
with 12 kills, 25 assists and 17 digs while logging
a .375 hitting percentage and adding five block as-
sists.
With Murphy and junior setter Brynja Rodgers
(28 assists) distributing the ball, sophomore outside
hitters Kristy Jaeckel and Colleen Ward racked up acombined 36 kills.
But Wise said the difference in the match was
Florida's blocking, which was the Gators' biggest
flaw earlier in the year. UF outblocked South Caro-
lina by its largest margin of the season, 12-5, and
has now won the blocking battle in three of its last
four matches.
UF took a 22-19 lead in a back-and-forth first set,
but South Carolina scored three straight points to
tie it up. With the score knotted at 24, Florida gave
the set away with two attack errors.
After committing eight hitting errors in the first
set, Florida cut that number in half in the second
frame. The Gators took a 5-4 lead and never relent-
ed, riding a five-to-one blocking advantage and a
.268 hitting percentage, up from .209 in the first set.
After calling her young team's maturity and vol-
leyball IQ into question after its loss to Kentucky on
Friday, Wise was impressed with the Gators' ability
to put the errors in Wednesday's first-set loss be-
hind them.
"The difference is, could last year's team have
been down 0-1 and still come back?" Wise said.
"Last year's team had to go to five [sets], and I would
argue that South Carolina is better this year."

PHIL, from page 21
game time."
If Meyer is to stick by his word,
third-year sophomore John Brant-
ley will be the Gators' quarterback
Saturday.
That is the right call. That is the
definition of erring on the side of
caution.
It's not throwing in the towel.
It's being realistic.
Saturday will mark two weeks
since Tebow suffered the first con-
cussion of his career. A second
concussion can be more damag-
ing than the first, but Meyer said
Wednesday that if Tebow is OK,
then he faces no additional risk
based on his first concussion.
"If you're healed, you'rehealed,
whether it's next week or the week
after," Meyer said. "If you're not
healed, you're not healed.
"I asked that question. Is it the
same next Tuesday as opposed to
this Thursday? Once the symp-
toms are cleared, he's cleared."
Is two weeks enough? No one
will know. Not with certainty.
Meyer and UF have done all
the right things, assembling an all-
star cast of doctors to evaluate one
of the best college football players
of all time. They have brought in
professionals from out-of-state
including Dr. Mickey Collins, as-
sistant director of the Sports Medi-
cine Concussion Program at the
University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center.
Meyer has and will obtain the
most accurate professional opin-ion from elite doctors, but he still
faces a losing proposition.
No mailer the medical answer,
Tebow must sit Saturday.
Because if he does not stay on
the sidelines, he will play the same
brand of football that has made
him famous. He will keep more
options than he should, run at
defenders rather than sliding and
throw caution to the wind if the
game requires it.
And if No. 15 suffers a concus-
sion, blame will rest on Meyer's
shoulders, medical clearance be
damned.
Ironically, Meyer will face one
of the biggest risk takers in the
sport on the opposite sideline, LSU
coach Les Miles. Miles has rolled
the dice more than anyone in re-
cent history, winning more than
he loses.
This gamble isn't worth it.
Let Brantley start and lean on
the rushing game. Give one of
the best defenses in the country a
chance to keep Florida in the game
and vindicate memories of two
years.
If the Gators lose Saturday
without Tebow, and proceed to
run the table (including the SEC
Championship), what poll voter
would keep a 12-1 UF team out of
the BCS National Championship
Game, if the only loss was at Tiger
Stadium with Tebow not playing?
Bring No. 15 and throw him
on the sidelines. Let him inspire
his teammates to try and win the
game for him.
This one isn't on Tim's shoul-
ders. This one is on Meyer.Team not releasing grade of concussion
TEBOW , from page 21
Since returning to practice,
Tebow has split reps with back-
up John Brantley.
In limited time this season
Brantley has completed 73.3 per-
cent of his passes (22-of-30), for
232 yards and four touchdowns.Meyer played down the
thought that all of the back and
forth about Tebow's condition
has affected Brantley's prepara-
tion.
"John will be fine," Meyer
said. "John has done good. He's
had a heck of a week at practice,
and he's preparing to go play the
game."Evaluation of Tebow will be
ongoing and if the senior is not
able to play against the Tigers,
Brantley will get his first career
start under the lights in Baton
Rouge.
Meyer said he has been told
the grade of Tebow's concus-
sion, but declined to release it
publicly.
