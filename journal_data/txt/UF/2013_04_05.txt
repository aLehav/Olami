  The pocket was breaking down, and Anto-
nio Morrison saw EJ Manuel had nowhere to 
go. 
  Florida State led Florida 20-16 with 11:16 
remaining in the fourth quarter, and the Semi-noles were driving. The Gators needed a big play to not only avoid their third straight loss in the rivalry but to keep their national cham-pionship hopes alive.
  Enter Morrison.  As Manuel bounced around the backﬁ  eld 
looking for a hole, Lerentee McCray got his hands on the signal-caller, wrapping up the speedster’s knees. Half a second later, Morri-son arrived on the scene and leveled Manuel.
  The ball came out and squirted across the 
turf. Manuel lied motionless — unconscious — in a crumpled heap on Florida State’s 38-yard line. Defensive end Dominique Easley ﬁ  nally corralled the loose ball, sparking a 21-6 Florida run to end the game.
  Morrison was the catalyst.
  “I always do stuff like that,” he said.
  Manuel was perhaps the hardest hit of 
Morrison’s 34 tackle victims in 2012. Morrison developed a reputation for big hits during his ﬁ  rst season in Gainesville.
  “He’s really a big hitter — that’s the thing 
about him. ‘Tone just likes hitting,” running back Matt Jones said. “He’s a physical line-backer, and he’s just a physical person. You’re going to feel ‘Tone when he hits you.”
  When asked to describe Morrison, cor-
nerback Jeremy Brown provided a list: “Mad man, hard hitter, crazy, mean, scary.”
  Buck linebacker Dante Fowler Jr. add-
ed: “All he wants to do is clean somebody’s clock.”
  Morrison earned his reputation through 
unbridled enthusiasm in practice, something coach Will Muschamp loves to see. But Mor-rison becomes overzealous at times.
  He drew a scolding from Muschamp after 
delivering a jarring hit on tight end Kent Tay-lor in a practice drill on March 15. The Gators were not wearing pads that day. 
  “You want to be aggressive,” Muschamp 
said. “You want to play with great tough-ness, and it’s my job to make sure we judge the right way on what is too much and what is not enough. He’s certainly one that pushes the envelope.”
  Morrison added:  “Sometimes, [rage] can 
control your whole game and you’ll mess up and do the wrong thing, so you’ve got to make sure you balance it out.”
  Morrison’s physicality is easier to deal 
with in Gainesville. Southeastern Conference athletes can take his hits better than his for-mer teammates at Bolingbrook, Ill. High. Like Muschamp, Bolingbrook High coach John Iv-low used to step in and ask Morrison to ease up at practice.
  “He plays the game the way it was meant to 
be played and supposed to be played,” Ivlow said. “Unfortunately, some guys haven’t got it like he does, and they’re neither as physical nor as tough as he is.”
  Muschamp added: “It’s fun to coach a guy 
that has a lot of passion and energy. I like self-starters. I like guys that go out there and self-start, that self-motivate themselves, that you don’t have to create an edge for them every day. And he’s a young man that you don’t have to create an edge for.”
            
     When Anthony Morrison played football at 
Bolingbrook High, Antonio would always tag along. But Antonio, who was 7 years younger than his brother, wasn’t there to watch.
  “He always wanted to come out and do the 
drills with us,” Anthony said. “He didn’t just come out and try to participate in the drills. He was actually trying to beat the guys I was working out with.”
  Once Anthony’s playing days ended, he 
took up coaching. As the defensive coordina-tor of Bolingbrook High’s sophomore team, he had the opportunity to coach his brother — as a freshman. One year later, Antonio was suit-ing up with the varsity team.
  Throughout his football career, Antonio 
has always been one step ahead.
  “He actually played D-end for us on varsity 
as a sophomore,” Ivlow said. “I always knew he was a football player. There was never any doubt in anybody’s mind.”
  Anthony always knew his brother was 
tough, but he gained new respect for Antonio through their player-coach relationship. Dur-ing one game his freshman season, Antonio chased down a ball carrier 15 yards from be-hind and stripped the ball. Later in the same contest, Antonio made a diving interception to seal a Bolingbrook victory.
  “Ever since he was young, he always just 
had that competitive edge,” Anthony said. “Me and my dad, we saw that he had that in him and just continued to try to push him along. We tried to make things as tough as possible. So that way, if he ever got put in a situation where things may become tough, he had already experienced some things like that.”
 
             
 
    When Morrison committed to Florida, he 
was proactive — he had to be.
  Although Morrison, a four-star prospect, 
was a key member of the nation’s third-ranked recruiting class, ﬁ  ve-star recruits Jonathan Bullard and Fowler overshadowed him. Eight members of UF’s 2012 class were ranked high-er nationally than Morrison.
  Eager to contribute from the get-go, Mor-
rison graduated early from Bolingbrook High. He wanted to participate in the Gators’ spring practice. 
  “The fact that he graduated high school ear-
ly and got down there that spring, that helped him tremendously,” Ivlow said.
  Also, Morrison was undersized.  He has gained 9 pounds since commit-
ting to UF but Morrison still weighs the least among the Gators’ four starting linebackers at 229 pounds. But size has not limited Mor-rison.
  “Antonio is a beast. He goes hard every 
down,” Fowler said. “A lot of people think he is undersized, but for his size, he plays like one of the biggest linebackers in our league.”
  Coaches immediately took notice of the 
“Chicago ’backer.” Morrison recorded nine tackles, including one for a loss, in the 2012 spring game.
  “The ﬁ  rst day we put pads on, the ﬁ  rst 
day he was allowed to hit someone, he made it very clear that he likes hitting people,” de-fensive coordinator D.J. Durkin said. “We like people who like hitting people on defense. He made that statement very clear early on.”
  Morrison then built on a strong spring with 
a breakout performance in fall camp. Former UF defensive coordinator Dan Quinn was es-pecially impressed.
  “He really answers the bell when we chal-
lenge him,” Quinn said on Aug. 16.
  The bell rang early in Florida’s 20-17 win 
against Texas A&M on Sept. 8 in College Sta-tion, Texas. During the Gators’ ﬁ  rst defensive series, Will linebacker Jelani Jenkins suffered a fractured right thumb. One game and one series into his college career, Morrison was thrown into the ﬁ  re.
  He responded with six tackles as part of a 
defensive effort that limited the Heisman Tro-phy winner Johnny Manziel and the Aggies of-fense to only 99 yards during the second half.
  Quinn chalked up Morrison’s maturity in 
a crucial situation to the linebacker’s desire to prove himself.
  “He really wanted to play in the SEC — 
what a challenge,” Quinn said on Sept. 12. “This guy’s a real competitor saying, ‘OK, I’m from Illinois. I want to go to the SEC. I’m going early. I’m going to Florida,’ and he really came in with this competitive linebacker mindset that you love. That’s one of the things I respect most about him. Early on in his career, it was not too big. It was not that, ‘I just want to ﬁ  t in early.’ It was, ‘I want to come in, and I want to play, and I want to show that I belong.’ He’s certainly done that.”
               
    Another bell is ringing in 2013.  Morrison is a holdover on a Florida defense 
hit harder by graduation and early entries to the NFL draft than any player on the receiving end of one of his tackles.
  Even Quinn is gone, replaced by the newly 
promoted Durkin.
  The Gators needed a leader, and Muschamp 
deemed Morrison ready for the challenge. 
  Only a sophomore, Morrison is stepping in 
for departed team captain Jon Bostic at middle linebacker. Lining up in the heart of Florida’s defense, Morrison will be the hub for the Gators’ communication.
  Muschamp said Morrison needs to work 
on making checks at the line of scrimmage and staying level-headed in his increased role. Both skills will develop with experience.
  “He’s a very emotional young man, and 
that’s something that we’re trying to let him table a little bit,” Muschamp said. “Regardless of the results of the previous play or the cir-cumstances or situations of the game, you’ve got to move and play the next play.”
  Morrison will debut as the leader of Flor-
ida’s new-look defense in the Gators’ spring game on Saturday at 1 p.m. in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
With a new coordinator, seven new starters 
and a new role, changes abound for Morrison and the UF defense. But one part of Morrison will never change.
  “Every time I get in the game,” Morrison 
said, “I go hard.”

Hail and tornado warnings caused Dance 
Marathon to reschedule its annual Kickoff 
Celebration.
Nicole Martinez, the public relations over-
all chair for DM, said the extreme weather caused the event to be postponed to 5 p.m. today on Hume Field.
The kickoff celebrates the arrival of the 
main event on April 13 and 14, according to the release. Dance Marathon is a 26.2-hour event beneﬁting the patients of Shands Hos-pital for Children at UF.
Martinez, a 21-year-old UF advertising ju-
nior, said the kickoff will not lose any of its impact. Texas Roadhouse will still be catering the event. She said the bands Big Time and No Irie conﬁ  rmed they will still be perform-ing. However, she’s not sure if there will still be bounce houses because Hume Field does not have as many electrical outlets as Flavet Field, the previous location.
“I don’t think it matters what day it’s on,” 
said Paul Cancel, a 20-year-old UF accounting sophomore and DM theme staff member. “It’s about the cause behind it.”
The morale staff will still conduct a 26.2-
minute stand in honor of the families and chil-dren affected by serious illnesses, according to a press release.
Diana Baxter, a 21-year-old UF microbiol-
ogy senior and Greek chair for Donate Life, said she’s glad people won’t have to take part in all the activities in the rain. In the long run, she said she thinks today will be better be-cause of the nice weather.DM kickoff

UFApps, a pilot program 
for UF students that provides 
software programs from Au-toCAD to SPSS for free, is ex-periencing technical difﬁ  cul-ties, which led to being taken down several Adobe programs including Photoshop and In-Design.Casey Juby, an 18-year-
old UF architecture freshman, has been using a 30-day trial of Photoshop for her assign-ments. Once the trial expired, she logged onto UFApps to use Photoshop for her design studio project only to realize the program was missing.
“It’s really inconvenient,” 
Juby said. “Now I have to go to the CIRCA lab instead.”The soft-
ware disap-peared from the UFApps website last week, caus-ing a nui-sance for 
the website, whose plat-
form is based on convenience. It allows students to use expen-sive software remotely — even on their phone — without hav-ing to worry about licensing.
“We are working to resolve the situation, which we believe is temporary,” UF spokesman Steve Orlando wrote in an email. “It is important to note that the UF apps initiative is a pilot and not a full produc-tion. By deﬁ  nition, pilot pro-grams are for trying different things.”
There is no word as to when 
the Adobe programs will be relaunched on UFApps. In the meantime, students are resort-ing to older versions of the pro-grams and cracked software to complete their assignments.

Goat that walked into Mont. bar 
was taken from zoo
BUTTE, Mont. — So the goat 
that walked into a Montana bar 
last weekend ... was stolen from a petting zoo.
Fairmont Hot Springs Resort 
general manager Steve Luebeck said staffers knew the goat was missing but didn’t realize it had been stolen until they saw a sto-ry in The Montana Standard on Wednesday reporting that a goat had been taken into a Butte bar early Sunday.
The pygmy goat, named Shir-
ley, was returned to the resort’s petting zoo.
Luebeck told The Standard he 
has never had an animal stolen from the zoo, which has goats and miniature horses. 
He said zoo managers would 
like to know who took the animal so they can press charges.

◗ IT RAISES MONEY FOR 
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS.

UF students will be Hop-
ping 4 A Cure from 1:45 p.m. to 
6 p.m. Sunday at the Broward Outdoor Recreation Complex.
The event, hosted by Fresh-
man Leadership Outreach, will raise money for multiple sclerosis scholarships, care-giver support and medical re-search.
It costs $15 for individual 
registration, which includes a ticket and T-shirt, and $125 for group registration, which includes 10 tickets and 10 T-shirts.
The event will have speed, 
endurance, challenge and ex-treme hopscotch competitions. Other than hopscotch, there will be four square, Hula-Hoop, jump rope and basket-ball.
David Nassau, an 18-year-
old UF marketing freshman, said he and his friend started Hopping 4 A Cure in January 2011. They got the idea in Oc-tober 2010, when they dressed up in suits one day at their high school for National Suit Up Day, a fictional holiday inspired by “How I Met Your Mother.”
They walked the halls jok-ing they were the first two of-ficial members of a hopscotch team. Other students were in-terested in joining, and the two decided to turn it into a charity event.
Nassau’s father was diag-
nosed with multiple sclerosis about eight years ago, and he experiences memory failure along with some other cogni-tive symptoms and minimal physical ones.
“He can’t even ride a bike 
now,” Nassau said.
Valerie Sheehan, the 
33-year-old owner of local startup company ToneRite, is one of the sponsors.
ToneRite manufactures and 
sells a vibrating product for string instruments that mimics the effects of a person actually playing it.
Sheehan’s father was diag-
nosed with multiple sclerosis when she was born.
“I donate whenever I can,” 
she said, “whenever I hear about it.”

Many scientists find themselves 
spending more time managing 
money than using it, but UF may have found a solution.
UF’s new grant-management 
system, myinvestiGator, launched about four months ago. Since then, about 1,400 members of UF’s faculty and staff have used the program to manage about $700 million in re-search grants. For many of them, myinvestiGator is the answer to eas-ing budgeting headaches and sav-ing time.
“We really wanted to make it faculty focused, and it had been found to be a high-priority need,” said Stephanie Gray, director of the UF Division of Sponsored Research. “They wanted online banking but for grants.”
MindTree, a recent addition to 
the Gainesville area, helped imple-ment the system, with a design that needed no training to use. The part-nership marked the first time UF has worked with an outside company to develop internal software.
“It’s very hard to create some-
thing easy to use for everybody,” said Jason Williams, senior user experience designer at MindTree. “You don’t know how tech-savvy the users will be, so you have to find a happy medium.”
Gray said a task force was put to-
gether in 2010 to develop programs that would make the financial as-pects of research more efficient. MyinvestiGator was delayed due to an overhaul of the human re-sources system. The pace and lack of programmers available at the time drove the task force to look at al-ternatives to internal development, Gray said. Two companies submit-ted demos of ideas in August.
As users give feedback, Gray said 
the company will be working with UF to ensure the system continues to grow and expand effectively.

I can, whenever I hear

remember that as students to-day, we are preparing to be tomorrow’s educators, doctors or therapists,” said Ashley Gid-dings, a 22-year-old UF neuro-biological sciences senior and president of IMPACT Autism. 
Tuesday was World Autism 
Awareness Day, where orga-nizations around the world promoted awareness of the developmental disorder. Au-tism Speaks pushed the Light It Up Blue campaign, where landmarks and buildings in 750 cities used blue lights to illumi-nate for the cause.President Barack Obama 
also unveiled the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies initiative, which aims at mapping out the human brain and its circuits in action, according to a CBS article. The plan hopes to find cures for autism, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease, and it will start in 2014.
Leilani Doty, director of 
UF’s Memory and Cognitive Disorders clinics, said the plan was a major step toward the development of treatments and cures for brain health issues.
“It is something that we ab-
solutely need,” she said. “Even though we do know some of the simple functions of the brain, there is really so much more that we need to learn about.”
Elizabeth Slonena, a 22-year-
old UF psychology senior and president of the UF Neurosci-ence Club, said Obama’s initia-tive will have a positive impact on the field of neuroscience.
“It’ll really allow the neuro-
science community to explore different aspects of neurosci-ence and go back to the basics,” she said. Autism conference

Keep Alachua County Beautiful 
is recruiting volunteers to participate 
in the Great American Cleanup on Saturday. The countywide cleanup, which is part of the nationwide litter-collection effort, will begin at 8 a.m. at Westside Park in Gainesville.
“[Saturday] is an easy way for 
people to get involved and celebrate the impact we can make in Alachua County,” said Gina Hawkins, execu-tive director of Keep Alachua Coun-ty Beautiful.
Volunteers will be assigned to lo-
cations throughout the county and provided with supplies for remov-ing litter, planting and removing graffiti at designated sites such as along Southwest Archer Road and West Newberry Road.
Last year, 657 people participat-
ed. Since then, new locations have been added to the list of cleanup sites based on requests from people wanting to clean their communities.
This year, more than 300 volun-
teers have already registered for the cleanup. The organization will continue accepting volunteers, even those who show up the day of.
Danielle Mortimer, a 22-year-old 
UF English senior, has participated in the cleanup on behalf of Alpha Phi Omega for the past two years. Now, as an intern for Keep Alachua County Beautiful, she plans to par-ticipate again this year.
“Litter is a huge problem in Ala-
chua County,” she said. “It has a huge impact on our environment, and our environment has a huge im-pact on us.”
Although the Saturday cleanup 
coincides with Keep America Beau-tiful’s National Day of Action, the organization is accepting volunteers for ongoing litter removal and beau-tification projects until May 31.
“People should be excited to be 
part of something this big,” Hawk-ins said. “It builds community.”

“We let him go, and we never would have thought 
he would use that against us,” Tatum said.
Brandon Scott, a 20-year-old UF political science and 
economics sophomore, said the email was inappropri-ate. But because it was a group email, he said people shouldn’t feel offended, as it wasn’t directed at them.
“I feel like people are too sensitive when it comes to 
things like this,” he said. “It’s not like it was attacking anyone personally.”
But Rob Bailey, a 25-year-old Gainesville graph-
ics and web designer, disagreed. Because of the email, Bailey unsubscribed from the company’s email feed and blocked future messages from his inbox. He said he won’t do business with the company in the future because ordering requires keying in payment informa-tion.
“That speaks to incredible lack of security on their 
part,” he said.
To make up for the mistake, the company announced 
Thursday it would offer free delivery for all orders until Sunday. The company also sent an apology email that went straight to recipients’ spam folders, according to another post.
“It’s just not our day,” the post said.Contact Kelcee Griffis at kgriffis@alligator.org.emAiL , from page 1“I feel like people are too sensitive when

89 TOTAL VOTESThursday’s question: Do you think UF needs a new residence hall?
As a third-year upperclassman, I have taken numerous 
online courses, ranging from Man’s Food and Intro-duction to Managerial Accounting to Principles of 
Macroeconomics and Principles of Marketing.
Some have been easy, like Man’s Food, and attending 
live class would have felt counterproductive. I can’t imagine what attending lectures would be like. Others have been dif-ﬁ  cult, such as Introduction to Financial Accounting, Business Finance and Legal Environment of Business, which I am cur-rently taking.
As much as I appreciate the convenience of online classes, 
I have not yet gotten the hang of them.
Most critical tracking and core classes are virtual for 
business majors. One-third of the degree can be completed through online courses (by looking at degree requirements and number of classes which are taught online).
The convenience of attending class whenever and wher-
ever seems great — like if it’s 2 a.m. in my apartment, and I’m curled up in my comforter with hot chocolate on one side and a pile of laundry on the other.
What’s not so great is I don’t watch lectures on time, if at 
all, depending on the class. I even forget I’m enrolled in that class sometimes. A week before an exam, the stress and the number of times I go to Starbucks increases. Overwhelmed with the 30 hours of lectures I have yet to watch and the more than 200 pages I have to read, I ask myself: What was I do-ing for the past two months? How did I let myself do this again?
It always happens. There is a lack of professor-to-student 
interaction. I have not met many of my professors. They seem like celebrities, and if I randomly come across them at the Emerson Courtyard, I am starstruck. I’ve only seen them through my 15-inch Sony VAIO.
Maybe I can break the ice with, “Hello, Professor Rush, 
my name is Raksheen. I am among the hundreds of students in your class. Do you recognize me?”
“No.”“How about my UFID number?”“Maybe.”Another huge drawback is the lack of peer-to-peer inter-action. To ﬁ  nd a study buddy or someone to discuss today’s lecture on crimes and torts, you must go out of your way to ﬁ  nd that intellectual you wish to con-nect with. And trust me, this can be hard.  
Online classes are more dif-
ﬁ  cult than traditional ones. They take a lot more time and dedica-
tion. They generally consist of watching hours of lectures on-line, taking timed quizzes and, ultimately, showing up for an exam that will end late on a Tuesday night.
At the end of the semester, it can feel very dissatisfying.If there’s a concept that confuses me, I can’t raise my hand 
and ask. I can email the professor and get a response in a timely 24 to 48 hours, but do I really want to go through the effort of writing a lengthy professional email to a stranger? Or do I want to take the time to get dressed, go to campus and wait to see him or her during his or her ofﬁ  ce hours?
I’ll skip, hoping it’s not on the exam.  Most important, how much have I gained if I cannot 
implement what I have learned? Management requires the memorization of several deﬁ  nitions and concepts for exams.
If I memorize 60 pages in four months and get an A, does 
that make me smart and destined to be a stellar manager? If I slack and get a C, should I then give up on that career path?
There should be a component to the class that forces stu-
dents to physically meet to discuss and implement what is being taught in lectures, whether that’s through evaluating management techniques in a group, completing a group project or even further analyzing a case study.
Even though there’s the option to attend the live taping 
for many classes, either a conﬂ  ict or laziness prevents me. Missing out on someone speaking for two hours doesn’t bother me. I can always watch the same lecture at double the speed a month from now when I need to for the ﬁ  nal exam.
I want to interact with live humans, not with my screen.Raksheen Ayaz is an advertising and business junior at UF.

Mark your calendars right now, folks. This week, the 
long-awaited “Arrested Development” fourth season was given a release date: May 26. The new season will 
have 15 episodes and will be streamed on Netﬂ  ix. So, get your Netﬂ  ix accounts ready, too. If you don’t have one, then sign up for an account by the end of April — you get the ﬁ  rst month of Netﬂ  ix free, FYI.
“Finally my simple wish for the show is coming true: that it 
be broadcast every second around the clock to every television, computer or mobile device in existence,” the show’s creator and executive producer Mitch Hurwitz said in a statement, accord-ing to a Reuters article. Who cares if the show was originally canceled due to poor ratings? “Arrested Development” is the Cinderella of cable TV. It gives us hope for other shows that may not be doing so hot. We give a family-love-Michael LAUREL to 
“Arrested Development.” We can’t wait to catch up with the Bluth family.
REAL PEOPLE ALERT: There’s at least one high school in 
Georgia that has segregated proms. “The school holds separate proms for white and non-white students. Homecoming is also normally segregated, with separate courts for each race,” report-ed The Hufﬁ  ngton Post. “Mail Online reports that the school has not broken any civil rights laws because it doesn’t actually spon-sor the segregated prom dances — or any prom dance, for that matter. Instead, parents and students are responsible for orga-nizing and funding the private events.”
We give a y’all-down-in-Georgia-need-to-get-with-the-pro-
gram DART to racists. If we live in a time where the Earth can 
open sinkholes to swallow people, then we shouldn’t have to worry about racist buttholes ruining prom for everyone. Prom is already not that great. Why would you make it worse?
This week, Facebook held yet another press conference dur-
ing which we all expected the company to announce it would be producing a Facebook phone. Luckily, it’s not. Sort of. It’ll be called Facebook Home.
“Home turns your phone into a Facebook device,” said a 
Wired article. “Even with the lock screen on, a photo stream of your friends’ activities ﬁ  lls the screen. Updates appear on your home screen, too. What’s more, Home makes Facebook the pri-mary means of communication on your device. The company’s messaging software merges with SMS, and you can continue using its ‘chat heads’ to text while inside another app.” We give a we-guess-you’re-allowed-to-take-over-a-whole-phone-but-maybe-we’re-already-on-our-phones-too-much FLART  
to Zuckerberg. We like your panache, but it feels unnecessary 
here.
That’s all for this week, everybody. We want to end this Darts 
& Laurels with a little reminder to be nice to those around you. The end of any semester can get a little hectic and crazy, but that doesn’t give us an excuse to behave like idiots. If everyone could be respectful for these last few weeks and then for the rest of their lives, that would be great. Thank you.
Have a fun and safe weekend, and go Gators!

Stand up for the real victims
You might not remember the name of 
Matthew Shepard.
You might not remember how he was 
tortured, beaten unconscious and tied to 
a fence in a mock cruciﬁ  xion, left to die in a remote area of Wyoming.
You might not remember that he was 
targeted because of his sexuality. But I do. I remember each and every case of teen suicide, school bullying and violent homicide that continues in the face of ig-norance espoused by religious “defend-ers” like Erik Skipper.
Aside from his belittlement of the 
First Amendment, Erik used his column to mock O’Reilly’s defense of homosex-uals’ rights as American citizens to be treated equally, and he implied homo-sexuality is akin to polyamory and in-cest. Simply and emphatically, it is not.  
Skipper doesn’t bother to argue why 
such unions are fundamentally wrong. He prefers to rely on shock and reli-giously instituted social norms to win you over. While Skipper sits on his self-awarded laurel as a defender of Christi-anity and moral law, he fails to offer any compelling argument, ironically ignor-ing the message of tolerance and love found in the biblical verses he cites. The Bible has no place in legal or social ar-guments, but you should at least try to understand what you’re saying ﬁ  rst.
On one hand, Skipper complains 
Christians get a bad rap when all they really want to do is love every individual regardless of circumstance or sexuality. On the other, he blindly adheres to cat-egorizing “legitimate” love as that be-tween a man and a woman — even con-cluding that any other union will lead to society no longer understanding the dif-ference between right and wrong. To be honest, if Erik Skipper is the one deﬁ  n-ing right and wrong, then humanity is in pretty bad shape. The only prerequisite in his mind is opposing genitals.
Skipper states the role of the govern-
ment is to uphold the values given to us by God, not man. When it comes down to it, “all they know how to do is ‘thump the Bible.’” Grow up, and read a new book. You fear gay marriage endangers the sanctity of marriage while we fear for our lives.

Letter to the Editor
One of the most common complaints I have heard regarding marriage equal-ity is it’s a  slippery slope. If marriage 
equality is allowed to redeﬁ  ne marriage, then eventually “bigamist, polygamist, incestuous or various other deviants,” to quote an online comment on a recent Alligator column, will be allowed to redeﬁ  ne marriage as well.
This column is not a response to that slope.Instead, there is another slope we are on. 
The litany of horrible, eye-burning designs of college sports uniforms that garner the most TV time.
We can pretty much attribute the uniform 
craze to the University of Oregon. The Ducks have a well-documented partnership with Nike founder Phil Knight due to him attending the school in the ’50s. Nike provides the foot-ball team with a different uniform each game, which has become an identity and a tradition for the team. They were able to create an iden-tity based on crazy aesthetic designs with their equipment. They have extended that identity past uniforms to the hardwood of the basket-ball court, which is designed to look like the court is in the middle of a forest.
The problem starts with schools with a long 
history and tradition. The University of Cali-fornia, Los Angeles, whose 10 different men’s basketball titles under John Wooden alone ri-val all of Oregon’s championships across all sports, donned a Zubaz-inspired uniform during this year’s NCAA men’s bas-ketball champion-ship tournament, much to the cha-
grin of fans and alumni.
The University of Georgia just revealed its 
logo and uniform have been redesigned. UF has even changed its uniforms, sacriﬁ  cing a pleasing design for the sake of announcers be-ing able to provide faster details about who made a play. And let’s not forget about when the University Athletic Association abandoned the “Gators” script in favor of bland white hel-mets featuring a boring “F” for a couple games in 2009. Occasional alternate jerseys for special games are one thing, but abandoning the style fans have come to love for the sake of attracting one more recruit or selling one more uniform is akin to placing a comments-and-concerns box over a shredder. It’s almost as bad as chang-ing the Spring football game to a mere public practice.

Twice a week, Giovana Perazzo takes 
her children to a local nonprofit gym to let 
them exercise and be themselves.
Although her son, Matteo Gavilano, 
6, has high-functioning autism, it doesn’t stop him from joining his 3-year-old sis-ter, Camilla Gavilano, in Balance 180 Gymnastics & Sports Academy’s Young Athletes Program.
Perazzo and her family will be attend-
ing the Special Olympics Young Athletes Program culminating ceremony for the first time Sunday.
“They adore gymnastics, and I think 
it’s one of the skills that they need now to develop well, so they can grow better,” she said.
Twenty-seven children are enrolled in 
the gym’s Special Olympics, 12 of whom are enrolled in the gym’s Adaptive Gym-nastics class, which focuses on children with disabilities.
Krista Vandenborne, a founding direc-
tor of Balance 180, said the gym is open to children with and without disabilities.
“We don’t want to be just exclusive 
with disabilities. We really want to have a community that embraces children with varying disabilities, so they can play to-gether side by side,” she said.
Since joining the gym, Perazzo has 
seen an improvement with Matteo, espe-cially in his flexibility and social skills.
“I highlight a lot the activity that [the 
directors and volunteers] do,” she said. “It inspires me. It inspires me as a mom, and it inspires me to give something to other people one way or another.”Gym gives children special opportunities

To celebrate the 500th anniversary of Ponce De Leon’s 
landing in Florida, Gainesville residents and UF students 
can learn about the state’s roots at the Celebrating La Flori-da: Spanish Origins at the Edge of the World event.
The event will be held Saturday at 10:15 a.m. in the Pow-
ell Hall Classroom, located at 3215 Hull Road.
A panel, consisting of five University Press of Florida au-
thors, will discuss the history of Florida and hold a Q-and-A session, said marketing manager Teal Amthor-Shaffer.
“The idea is to make this engaging for the public,” she 
said.
The event will target residents who are already in touch 
with state history, she said, as well as people who are inter-ested in finding out what De Leon’s monumental discovery of the state is all about.
“A lot of people don’t realize how far back Florida his-
tory goes, even if they are residents here,” she said.
Steve Noll, a UF history professor and one of the event 
speakers, said De Leon’s landing in Florida was significant because it kicked off the period of European control in the state.
“It marks the first real significant contact between Euro-
pean and Native Americans [in Florida],” he said. “Florida’s native environment is amazing because it is probably so dif-ferent from most of the United States.”

A Canadian man died in the hos-
pital Wednesday night following a 
car accident on Interstate 75 that af-ternoon. Doctors from Shands at UF pronounced Edward T. Hodgins, 78, dead at about 10:30 p.m. Wednes-day, according to the Florida High-way Patrol.
At about 3:30 p.m., Hodgins and 
his wife, Sylvia Hodgins, 78, both of Stratford, Ontario, were driving south on I-75 during a rainstorm. Sylvia Hodgins was driving her 2002 Lincoln LS when it hydroplaned and she lost control, veering into the roadway’s west shoulder about half a mile north of the Northwest 39th Avenue exit.
The car flipped and crashed into a tree, landing on its roof and trap-ping the couple inside. Both of them were wearing their seatbelts. When FHP troopers and Alachua County Fire Rescue Services officials arrived at the scene, firefighters removed the couple from the car, and paramedics later took them to Shands at UF.Later that night at the hospital, 
Edward Hodgins died from the injuries. Thursday, Sylvia Hod-gins remained in stable condition, said FHP spokeswoman Sgt. Tracy Hisler-Pace.

Boston Red Sox catcher David Ross went 1 for 3 and threw out two base runners in a 4-2 loss to the New York Yankees on Thursday night in New York.JOSH JURNOVOY
Alligator Staff Writer
Less than two innings into 
the Gators’ game against UCF on 
Tuesday, they already faced  what coach Kevin O’Sullivan said was the most important point in the game.
Starter Tucker Simpson had 
loaded the bases and given up a run to put Florida in a 1-0 hole. O’Sullivan replaced Simpson with junior left-hander Daniel Gibson, who walked in a run but proceed-ed to escape the inning and shut out the Knights during the next four frames while allowing just three hits. UF recovered for a 5-3 win.“I didn’t know [Gibson] was 
going to go into the game and give us four and a third (innings),” O’Sullivan said. “For us, it was down to that point in the game where we didn’t want it to get away from us…. We’re in a situ-ation where we can’t be messing around.”
The Gators (14-16, 4-5 SEC) 
have gotten multiple dominant bullpen performances in the past week as they look to extend their winning streak to four games to-night in Starkville, Miss., against No. 18 Mississippi State (24-8, 3-6 SEC).
“Mood has changed in the bull-
pen a little bit,” sophomore right-hander Ryan Harris said. “Every-body’s ready to make a run at it.”
UF sophomore catcher Taylor 
Gushue said following the win against the Knights that he felt like the team was in a good place, playing loose and having fun. The current mood of the clubhouse is the opposite of what it was dur-ing its six-game losing streak ear-lier in the season, which Gushue called the team’s low point in the season. Gushue added that there has not been any big mechanical change that has turned the pitch-ers’ performances around. They have simply found the strike zone.
“When pitchers aren’t effec-tive, they’re not throwing strikes,” Gushue said. “We just pound it into the pitchers’ heads, ‘You’ve got to throw two of the first three pitches for strikes,’ and they’ve been doing that very well lately.”
During the losing streak, the 
Gators’ bullpen allowed 25 runs in 35 innings of work. In 22.2 in-nings pitched during the past five games alone, the UF relievers have allowed only two runs.
Florida has benefited from 
multiple impressive long-relief outings in both wins and losses since last week. In Florida’s 2-1 loss to FSU on March 26, Danny Young gave up one run in four innings after coming in for Simp-son. Gibson threw four shutout innings in last Friday’s loss to Ole Miss. Harris has two appear-ances of two innings or more, and sophomore Johnny Magliozzi had scoreless appearances of 2.2 and 3.2 innings.
Harris said the relievers’ abil-
ity to pitch effectively in long-relief, in addition to quality short outings, has been invaluable to the team.
“I think it’s just everybody is 
going out there and doing their job and staying out there as long as they’re needed,” Harris said. “I think it’s just a bulldog mental-ity. Everybody just wants to go and do as much as they can. Just go out there and not really worry about how long you’re going to be out there. Just do it.”

When Taylor Schwarz arrived at 
Florida, it was unclear how much play-
ing time she would see. 
The freshman 
first baseman was behind sopho-more Lauren Hae-
ger on the depth chart, but Schwarz’s solid defensive play pushed her into a starting role.
Now 39 games into her first college 
season, her bat is heating up to match her fielding.“In the beginning of the season, may-
be she was a little bit timid,” coach Tim Walton said. 
Added Schwarz: “I think my confi-
dence has gone up.” 
The freshman’s first season in college 
started with a bang.
At the Gators first tournament of the 
year in Tempe, Ariz., Schwarz hit two home runs — her first two hits at the col-lege level.
But when Florida returned from the 
West Coast, her production dropped off. Through the Gators’ first 12 games, she batted .125.Freshman’s confidence,

For the first time this outdoor season, 
the Gators are coming home. 
Florida hosts the 69th Annual Pepsi 
Florida Relays on Friday and Saturday at 
the Percy Beard Track at James G. Pressly Stadium. 
“The Florida Relays is really a compe-
tition where you see so much going on,” coach Mike Holloway said.
“I think the biggest part of it is that we 
get to compete in front of our home fans. Our whole team is competing in front of their family and their friends. Everybody’s excited. Everybody’s hyped about it.”
Under the guidance of former UF track 
coach Percy Beard, the Florida Relays be-gan in 1939 and featured seven colleges, nine high schools and nearly 200 athletes. Seventy-four years later, the meet now 
features more than 3,000 athletes from around the world. 
“I’ve been around the Florida Relays 
since, like, 1977,” Holloway said. “It’s a 
great competition. You see 
Olympians, world cham-pions, NCAA champions and great high school ath-letes all come together in one venue.
The thing that I’m al-
ways impressed with is the energy that goes into 
the meet.”
The Florida Relays mark the second ma-
jor outdoor event for the Gators in as many weeks.
Last week, Florida brought home five 
event wins at the Texas Relays in Austin, UF hosting 69th Florida Relays

Texas.
The event featured more than 
6,500 athletes. 
“It’s important that we see the bet-
ter competition,” Holloway said.
“I don’t think that the [Southeast-
ern Conference] is a league where 
you need to hide from people. You need to be able to run fast, throw far, jump high, jump far against the best in the country. That’s what we set the schedule for.” 
Florida faces stiff competition this 
weekend.
No. 6 Florida State and No. 8 USC 
are among the schools competing on the men’s side.
The women take on No. 6 Texas 
and No. 12 UCF.
Although the No. 3 Florida men 
and the No. 4 women are the highest ranked teams in each squad’s respec-tive field, the Gators say they are not taking the Florida Relays lightly. 
“We have to understand that we 
still have to perform,” Holloway said.
“We can sleep in our own beds, 
we get to rest well, and we get to be focused, but we can’t just take it for granted that we’re going to run well because it’s Florida Relays. We’re very excited, but we’re going to take it very seriously.”16, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, APRIL 5, 2013
Track , from page 15Six top-12 teams at meetSchwarz hitting .355 in SEC play
“I was a little intimidated, a little nervous.” 
Schwarz said early in the year. “High school 
softball wasn’t as big of a deal. … I think college softball is a big step up. I’m always expecting to play the best.”
But since her early-season slump, Schwarz 
has stepped up at the plate. She has raised her average to .275 and hit another two home runs. 
In Southeastern Conference play, Schwarz 
has been one of No. 3 Florida’s (36-3, 10-2 SEC) biggest contributors at the plate.
She leads the team with a .355 batting aver-
age and is second with a .500 on-base percent-age.
“Once we started facing better pitching and 
better teams, I just stepped into the box know-ing that I was facing a good pitcher, so what-ever was going to happen, it was going to be a battle,” Schwarz said. “If I won, I won. If I lost, then I was going to go the next time.”Walton has rewarded Schwarz for her im-
proved play.
She is one of only four Gators who has start-
ed every SEC game. Schwarz will likely get the starting nod when Florida plays Mississippi State (23-12, 2-7 SEC) this weekend in a three-game series at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium.
“As a freshman, she’s playing every game 
now,” Walton said. “That has also built her confidence to know that she can have a strike-out, have a bad game, and she’s going to play the next day.”
Although Schwarz has seen her plate prow-
ess improve, she has remained a consistent fielder and has not made an error this season.
“Her defense is what sets her apart from all 
of our other first basemen,” Walton said. “And now she’s being able to drive in runs, hit some home runs, get on base and do some things. So (she’s) definitely becoming much more com-plete.”

Florida was a running team in 
2012.
Led by 1,000-yard rusher Mike 
Gillislee and mobile quarterback 
Jeff Driskel, the Gators boasted the third-best ground game in the Southeastern Conference last sea-son with 187.7 yards per contest. But Florida wants increased bal-ance in 2013.
The Gators finished their first 
season under offensive coordina-tor Brent Pease last in the SEC and 118th nationally with 146.3 pass-ing yards per game. Florida’s in-consistent passing attack dragged its total offensive output per con-test to 334 yards, ranking 12th in the SEC and 104th in the NCAA.
Developing a more balanced 
attack this season hinges on Driskel’s development.
“We’re much more efficient,” 
coach Will Muschamp said. “We’ve made some vertical plays down the field against some cor-ners that can cover. So that’s been pleasing to see. Jeff’s been very accurate with the football.”
Driskel has improved his accu-
racy by developing a quicker trig-ger and better field vision.
After a year in Pease’s scheme, 
Driskel is more comfortable in the pocket.
“Experience will do it and get-
ting in the film room and putting in extra time, knowing the routes and knowing the defenses,” Driskel said. “So it’s kind of ev-erything coming together.”
Florida also hopes to aid 
Driskel’s development by improv-ing pass protection. The Gators ranked 115th in the nation with 39 sacks allowed last season.
“[Pass protection] is something 
we talked about a lot in the off-season,” offensive lineman Max Garcia said. “We got in, watched some extra film during meetings, like with our sacks. We definitely emphasize communication this year.”
Here Comes the Thud: When 
Matt Jones has the ball, Florida’s “thud” sessions change. 
Thud means the Gators de-
fenders hit the ball carrier with-out pulling him to the ground. If Jones is the target, those thuds are not pleasant. 
“When we’re tackling, they 
don’t tackle him,” Muschamp said. 
 With Mike Gillislee headed 
to the NFL, UF has an opening at running back. Over the course of spring practice, Jones has dis-tanced himself from his competi-tion. 
“Matt’s come on,” offensive co-
ordinator Brent Pease said. “You can see he understands things a lot more. He’s a strong, big kid. He’s got a really good football in-telligence.” 
Jones said his development 
took a step forward when he stopped dancing in the backfield and started to run more forcefully —  a lesson he said he learned during an “aggressive” conversa-tion with Muschamp. 
“It was something I definitely 
needed to hear,” Jones said. “I knew I had to hit it between the tackles and run angry.”
That downhill style was key to 
Gillislee’s success. As UF’s work-horse in 2012, Gillislee carried 244 times for 1,152 yards and 10 touchdowns. 
 “I’ve got big shoes to fill,” 
Jones said. “Coach talks about getting a lot of carries, but I’ve still got to stay humble. I’ve got a long way to go.”Jones carried 52 times 275 
yards and three touchdowns as a freshman. He improved as the season went on, playing his best game against Florida State on Nov. 24. 
He carried the ball eight times 
for 81 yards, including a 32-yard touchdown that stretched UF’s lead to 37-20 with 2:33 remaining in the fourth quarter. 
No light matter: Talent has never 
been an issue for D.J. Humphries. 
Rivals’ No. 2 overall play-
er in the 2012 recruiting class, Humphries has always had ideal height and athleticism. 
Weight, however, has been an 
issue. 
In a conference where the top 
tackles usually weigh a minimum of 300 pounds, Humphries said he entered college at 250. His re-cruiting page on Rivals had him at 265.  
He was listed at 275 on UF’s 
2012 roster and is currently listed at 280, although he says he weighs 283. 
“Ideally, I would like to be 300 
by the season, but anywhere from 290, 295,” Humphries said.  “That extra weight, it definitely helps. Especially in run blocking and getting guys off the ball.” 
With Xavier Nixon graduated, 
Humphries is the heavy favorite to land the starting left tackle job in 2013. 
While most players are using 
spring to learn schemes or refine techniques, Humphries top prior-ity remains adding good weight. 
“It’s just right weight, you 
know?” Humphries said. “Don’t want to put on too much weight and be fat and get hurt.”
