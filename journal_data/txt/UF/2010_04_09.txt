Panel of women discusses race, feminism
By SAMANTHA DELGADO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Sallie Ann Harrison's younger
sister was sexually assaulted by
her grandmother's neighbor. Con-
fused and angered at her commu-nity's complacency over the issue,
Harrison formed Gainesville's first
rape-crisis center.
Harrison and six other women
later formed a panel to address the
issues of the civil rights movement,
and Thursday night they relayedthe struggles of blacks and women
to an audience of about 150.
The panel discussion at the
Matheson Museum, Activists
Among Us: The Gainesville's
Women's Movement Across Gen-
erations, paid homage to womenlike Harrison's sister.
The Samuel Proctor Oral His-
tory Program at UF had received
feedback from the community that
there should be an event honor-
ing women's history, according
to Paul Ortiz, the director of OralHistory at UF. They decided to
hold an event to encourage more
gender research.

Machen meets with students to discuss shooting
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Writer
Five student organizers of Tuesday's rally
for Kofi Adu-Brempong, the graduate student
recently shot by the University Police Depart-
ment, met with President Bernie Machen and
other administrators Thursday afternoon todiscuss what the university can do to help
meet protesters' demands.
Machen was receptive to the protesters'
demands regarding the creation of a police re-
viewboard comprised of students and citizens,
the improvement in mental health services on
campus and the dropping of charges against
Adu-Brempong, said UF spokeswoman Jan-
ine Sikes, who was not in attendance.If the investigations recommended drop-
ping the charges against Adu-Brempong, Ma-
chen said the univer-
U F sity would have noAdministration problem doing so,
according to Sikes.
Dave Schneider, one of the protesters at
the meeting, said Machen has not explicitly
endorsed or accepted any of the demands butadded that Machen said none of the demands
is off the table.
Schneider said Machen wants to wait for
the results of the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement investigation to be released be-
fore making decisions regarding the demands
related to the dissolution of the Critical Inci-
dent Response Team and the unpaid suspen-
sion of officer Keith Smith.

The lights flashed on, the bass be-
gan to boom and the crowd, stand-
ing shoulder to shoulder, stood on
its toes, eager for the parade of drag
queens and kings to start.
Mimi Imfurst, dressed in a hot
pink dress with silver tassels that
glimmered under the stage lights,
walked onto the stage to Diana Ross'
"I'm Coming Out."
About 300 sets of awed eyes
watched her in a trance, packing
the Hippodrome State Theatre base-
ment to its capacity Thursday night.
Imfurst, who was the host for
the night, was the first act in the
sparkliest, sassiest spectacle of Pride
Awareness Month: The Fierce and
Fabulous Drag Show.
The $5,000 drag show, which was
sponsored by UF Student Govern-
ment and the Pride Student Union,
was the product of more than four
months of work, said Jade Woods,
co-director of the drag show.
She said the overall purpose
of Pride Awareness Month is to
educate and converge gay, lesbian,
straight and bisexual groups.The lineup consisted of three pro-
fessional drag kings and two profes-
sional drag queens -one of which
was Ongina, a contestant on season
one of VH1's reality TV show "Ru-
Paul's Drag Race," along with six
other amateur kings and queens.
UF mathematics senior Kyle
Krumenacker, whose stage name is
Kiki St. James, performed in knee-
high white boots and avant-garde
eye makeup, a blue contact in one
eye and white feathers for eyelashes
in the other.
"It took me five hours in front of
a makeup mirror [to look like this],"
Krumenacker
Around said.Gainesville Krumenacker
has been doing
drag shows for one year, perform-
ing at venues around Gainesville.
But his friend Renee Sheridan, a
Santa Fe College psychology sopho-
more, said Krumenacker "lives his
drag."
"He puts his life into it," she
said. "I mean, have you seen his cos-
tume?"
Sheridan came out to the show
not only to support her friend but
the entire pride awareness cause,
she said.
"You don't have to be gay to be a
gay activist," she said.

Students shed shoes
to show sympathy

A student puts her foot in paint to help make a mural of orange and blue footprints for "One Day
Without Shoes," sponsored by TOMS Shoes, Thursday afternoon on the Plaza of the Americas.By ERICA COOK
Alligator Contributing Writer
Some UF students found out Thurs-
day that walking around campus bare-
foot is no small feat.
A group of about 30 students walked
barefoot from the Reitz Union to the Pla-
za of the Americas at 11:30 a.m. Thurs-
day as part of One Day Without Shoes,
an international event that spreads the
word about the challenges faced by chil-
dren who own no shoes.
The event was organized by TOMS
Shoes, a company that donates a pair of
shoes to a child in need for every pair
it sells.
Although about 30 students
marched, the Facebook event "Gators
Go Barefoot-One Day Without Shoes"
had 192 confirmed guests who prom-
ised to go barefoot for at least an hour.
Sophomore Tuan Nguyen began his
day at 8 a.m. and realized that getting
around without shoes would not beeasy.
The bus driver was not too happy
about his choice to go shoeless.
"The goal was for people to
have fun and to see firsthand
what these children are going
through."
Nicole Johnson
One Day Without Shoes at UF

"She told me that she would not let
me ride the bus without shoes," Nguy-
en said. "I wasn't able to take them off
again until I got off the bus."
Nicole Johnson, who coordinated
One Day Without Shoes at UF, said the
event was about more than going bare-
foot.
"The goal was for people to have fun
and to see firsthand what these children
are going through," she said.

6, ALLIGATOR E FRIDAY, APRIL 9,2010
Get excited, people -the end of the semester is on the
horizon. But beware because there's something else lurking
on the surface of the calm waters. And that something has
taken the form of an exams-project-and-paper iceberg that
will take that optimistic steamboat of yours down if you're
not careful.
So please be on the lookout while we present you with
this week's even-if-your-ship-goes-down-we-promise-we'll-
never-let-go edition of.
Darts & Laurels
We also promise that'll be the last "Titanic" reference,
too.
Now on a completely unrelated subject: We'd like to
make peace with all the living dead running amok around
campus.
We're sorry if our editorial offended you, but in case you
haven't figured it out yet. uh, that's our job.
So, we're going to steal a Nerf rocket launcher from one of
the few human survivors left on campus and shoot as many
squishy foam you-zombies-really-need-to-take-a-chill-pill
DARTS at UF's zombie population. We've had more letters
to the editor about this than any other subject we've covered
this whole semester.
We get it, OK. Just play your silly fantasy game and leave
our inboxes alone before we alert the Hobbits and Keebler
elves.
Speaking of people who live in delusion, during the Q-
and-A segment of Accent's "Great Religion Debate," a dis-
gruntled audience member tried, and failed, to stammer out
a tirade accusing renowned atheist Christopher Hitchens for
"being a traitor to the left" and then saying something about
him smelling like scotch and other unintelligible gibberish.
The audience was not impressed, and Accent staffers
swiftly cut him off before he could further pollute the air
with his smog of insanity.
Therefore, we'd like to throw out a there's-only-room-for-
one-Andrew-Meyer-in-this-town DART to Justin Wooten.
In the future, keep your guttural noises to yourself.
However, the week wasn't all full of human garbage as
our favorite red-shirt wearing, home-wrecking golf icon (OK,
so we somewhat lied about the "human garbage" part) came
out of his hole to see whether he could see his delightfully
mixed shadow on the greens of Augusta. While we were re-
lieved to see him artificially admit to his transgressions, we
were more than stoked to see that he laid some new sod on
his once-million dollar endorsement face. Therefore, we're
teeing off a nothing-says-forgive-me-America-than-a-pedo-
phile-look LAUREL at Tiger Woods' goatee. Even if he only
had it for a few days, the big-boy look convinced us that he
learned after his first 2,349,829 women.
As our semester and this edition comes to close, we also
lament the end of a great and action-packed college basket-
ball season. While our team suffered defeat at the hands
of 30-year-old boy scouts on the first day, one team almost
caused the sports world to turn upside-down and inside out
with its Rudy-esque run to the title game. Although it came
up a bucket short and completely tore our brackets to shreds,
it was damn fun to watch. Therefore, we're chucking a half-
court-way-to-almost-put-all-of-Las-Vegas-out-of-business
LAUREL to the Butler University basketball team. So what
if the coach doesn't shave yet? Those kids can play.
So go forth, young men and women, this weekend as you
conquer the bars, catch up on much-needed sleep and cheer
on your football team as it takes the field for the annual glori-
fied backyard game.
Because if you don't, the terrorists will win.

Americans should not forget the past
ace relations in the United States are not perfect,
nor will they ever be. Since the election of Barack
Obama, the problems seem to be increasing.
White racists have been coming out of the woodwork un-
der the banners of the Tea Party, and one of their members
was arrested for spitting on African-American Rep. Emanuel
Cleaver while simultaneously shouting racial slurs.
"The Daily Show" aired a segment last week about an all-
white basketball league in Atlanta that hopes to return bas-
ketball to its roots of segregation and hatred. The next day it
aired a story about a white caller to C-SPAN telling them to
rename themselves Black-SPAN because of the apparently
high volume of African-American callers to the channel.
The president is facing a lot of hatred and criticism from
the zombie-like supporters of Glenn Beck, who claims the
president has an inherent hatred for white culture.
And finally, Michael Steele criticizes the left of the coun-
try for using the race card, then subsequently uses the race
card months later. In our racially polarized society, you
would think we wouldn't try to antagonize the problems
that are already there. And then there's Virginia. Gov. Rob-
ert F. McDonnell decided that it was, yet again, time to honor
the Confederate States of America with Confederate History
Month. We tolerant people like to call it April.
Why would we want to open the old wounds of slavery
and racism? Tourism and politics. McDonnell believes it will
help the tourism industry during the recession, and he wants
to please his conservative base that elected him.
Two points: First, the tourists who would flock to Virginia
because of Confederate History Month are not the kind of
people I would want coming to my state. I'm sure no one
wants to see a group of drawling, camo-wearing racists
blasting country music in their army vehicles complete with
"The South Will Rise Again" bumper stickers and Confed-
erate hate-flags traveling through their state. Second, is this
really what pleases the right wing now? I don't believe wePaul Murty
letters@a lIigator orgshould be white-washing history and
forgetting about the Confederacy. We
should continue teaching that, while
there were many reasons as to why
the Civil War began, slavery was at the
core of the Confederacy.
Ridding the country of slavery
should not be something to look back
on and regret, but that seems to be
what this month wants you to do.
Conservatives want you to see how evil government in-
volvement is, no matter how it is involved. So getting rid of
slavery, like giving people who can't afford health care the
opportunity to not have to go into debt to save and prolong
their lives, is an evil because it involves the federal govern-
ment too much. The most disturbing part of the proclama-
tion McDonnell was that there was no mention of the evils of
slavery until he was pressed to do so. The fact that a gover-
nor of a large state in the U.S. chose to re-introduce a month
honoring the Confederacy but didn't think about the racial
repercussions is ridiculous. I can't look at a Confederate flag
without thinking about its ties to a horrible part in the history
of America, but McDonnell didn't even consider it.
McDonnellbacktracked after media and public scrutinyin
an I'm-not-a-racist-I-have-a-black-friend manner by describ-
ing how evil slavery was.This came soon after his original re-
sponse to not mentioning slavery -he didn't focus on slavery
because it wasn't important enough. Instead, he focused on
the ones he "thought were most significant for Virginia."
There is clearly a problem in the mentality of people like
McDonnell and the base he was pleasing with his proclama-
tion. This goes beyond the idiots who show their racism by
putting the Confederate flags on their trucks. This is a politi-
cal move by a governor to show support for the Confederate
States of America, which is a problem.

Chivalry is alive and kicking
A gentleman is as gentle as the woman he
wishes to impress or pursue. When we see
chivalry as a long-forgotten, dusty corpse, it
means that somewhere inside we have mur-
dered it. The problem with our generation is
not that we don't know how to court, but that
women have forgotten how to be women and
men have become utterly confused as a result.
The independent-woman syndrome has
become a worldwide phenomenon and so
has filing for divorce within three months of
jumping the broom. It has quickly transformed
from a means of supporting a single-parent
family to showing these men who the real boss
is. I cringe at the idea of a relationship being
destroyed by a woman's insistence to pay the
Red Lobster bill when her date is willing and
able. I am by no means on the men's side, but
how do you force the horse to drink from the
well when it's already toting a water bottle?
To the ladies: A successful, intelligent, so-
phisticated woman is still, by nature, a woman
-not he weaker and incapacitated sex, but
the more delicate side of creation. It becomes
a problem when these women begin to feel
that their equality with men must be power-
fully demonstrated. If a man is given the op-
portunity to approach you without feeling the
need to buy out the bar -because at some
point you listed all of your most credible ac-
complishments and then some -he might
just abandon his "playa" tactics and step up to
a real woman. In relationships, whenever we,
women, feel the need to prove ourselves and
be independent all the time, it often backfires,
leaving us lonely with a hundred cats. Let
the man express how much he cares through
his actions and learn to appreciate the fact
that just because we're created with physicaluniqueness does not mean that we are lesser
or better. Let a man be a man. And if you're a
real woman, you'll know exactly what that is.
It's time we stop trying to kill chivalry rather
than embrace it.

PETA thanks AAA for hosting VegFest
I would like to compliment the Animal Ac-
tivists of Alachua (AAA) for once again host-
ing a successful VegFest event ("500 Try Vegan
Pizza, Ice Cream at VegFest," Thursday).
Through actions such as distributing food
on the Plaza of the Americas and greeting
attendees when PETA Vice President Bruce
Friedrich spoke at UF earlier this semester,
AAA has established a reputation for politely
educating people about how a vegan diet ben-
efits human health, the environment and, of
course, animals. By choosing vegan pizza or
ice cream (or the delicious Hare Krishna Lunch
option of the day) instead of meat, eggs or
dairy products, UF students are taking a stance
against the egregious cruelty that animals
face on factory farms and in slaughterhouses.
Chickens, for example, have their beaks cut off
with hot blades, and most of them have their
throats cut while they're still fully conscious. If
this kind of abuse were inflicted on the dogs or
cats we share our homes with, it would result
in felony cruelty-to-animals charges.
However, thanks to the efforts of student
groups such as AAA, EnVeg and compassion-
ate UF students from all walks of life, it's never
been easier to choose a healthy and humane
vegan option at every meal.

Reader tired of people defending student
in shooting incident
I'm tired of everyone standing up for Kofi.
You only have a problem because he is a stu-
dent like you. You have no reason to defend
him. In case you didn't know, he had been
sending e-mails to staff accusing them of want-
ing to kill him. He was also under the impres-
sion he was going to be kidnapped and taken
to Africa and slain. He was either on drugs
or completely insane. The police officers who
broke into his apartment were in the right.
They did exactly what they were trained to
do. There is no such thing as police brutality.
The police are trained to do whatever it takes
to subdue a problem. People just blow it out
of proportion. Stop defending Kofi, and stop
trying to fight the police officers.

Columnists should be more serious
I am writing to lodge a complaint against
Tommy Maple and Ryan Spencer. A column
is an opportunity to make people think about
ideas and issues in a way that other sections
of the newspaper can't. I believe the two of
you often squander this opportunity in an ef-
fort to sound humorous and smart. As an avid
reader of The New Yorker, where high-brow,
and often convoluted language ultimately
serves as a flourish to a more important point,
I encourage Maple and Spencer to have a little
more respect for their readers. I often finishFRIDAY, APRIL 9, 2010 U ALLIGATOR, 7
one of their columns and find that thought-
provoking substance occupies a marginal
space, and the remainder is a weekly exercise
in the stringing together of forced metaphors.
Now, I know that these columns are supposed
to be humorous, and I think they both have a
talent for humor. I only ask that if you're go-
ing to write a column with a subject matter of
importance, that the subject matter get a little
more airtime next to the humor.

Protesters should consider officers' per-
spective in shooting
I feel the public is ignoring one side of the
graduate student shooting incident, probably
because it is easier to identify with the stu-
dent and not with the police officers. People
say things like "I feel like this could happen
to me," or "This should have been handled by
mental health professionals," without really
thinking about the situation.
Yes, this could happen to any student on
campus who sends insane messages, screams
and breaks windows, ignores being repeated-
ly shot with everything from Tasers to military
rifles and charges police officers with a club.
Of course, a few words from a social worker
would instantly get through to someone so
far-out they're able to ignore point-blank rub-
ber buckshot. And, most importantly, when
you're a police officer and someone charges at
you with a weapon you should drop your rifle
and fight them unarmed because you'd rather
die yourself than shoot the attacker.

about her arrests
By VICTORIA ISRAELS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Col. Ann Wright has 15 reasons to speak out against the
government -one for about every time she's been arrested.
Tonight, she'll discuss both her criminal record and political
views at the Civic Media Center's SpringBoard 2010 fundrais-
ing dinner. Wright, an internationally acclaimed activist and
Army veteran, will speak about the press coverage given to res-
ignations and other forms of political dissent over the years.
"I am quite positive that the Bush administration's decision
to invade Iraq was based on info that was wrong, and they
knew it was wrong," Wright said. "The American public were
lied to about the Saddam Hussein regime, and seven years
later, it was still a bad decision."
She served in the U.S. Army for 29 years
Around and the Foreign Service for more than 15Gainesville years, with postings in Sierra Leone, Af-
ghanistan, Grenada and Somalia.
In March 2003, she resigned from her position in the Foreign
Service in protest of the Bush administration's policies.
Since her resignation, Wright has become an active advo-
cate against war. Wright said she has been denied access into
Canada because she is on the National Crime Information Cen-
ter database due to her arrests for nonviolent protesting.
The dinner will begin at 6 p.m. at the Matheson Museum,
located at 513 E University Ave. Tickets for the fundraiser can
be purchased for $15 in advance or $20 at the door.

Economy affects study abroad
By BRITT PERKINS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Tatiana Salazar reports to
class five times a week to con-
jugate verbs and use punctua-
tion in French.
Salazar, a UF art history ju-
nior, plans to study abroad in
France next summer. Though
she could push herself to grad-
uate next spring, she's plan-
ning on taking her final cours-
es while in Europe.
"In undergrad, you have
more opportunities to do it, so
you have to take advantage of
it," Salazar said.
The cost is something she
hasn't totally figured out yet.
"I'm kind of relying on
scholarships and loans for it,"
Salazar said. "I know the tick-
et is probably $1,000, and the
whole trip is possibly $8,000."
But she isn't the only one
juggling the cost of financing atrip abroad.
According to a recently-
conducted survey conducted
by The Forum on Education
Abroad, 66 percent of the re-
spondents reported that the
global economic crisis has had
a negative effect on their study
abroad programs.
"Students traveling dur-
ing a really hard econom-
ic shake tend to be more
affluent travelers. "
David Maas
program assistant
UF's International Center
is among those that have seen
fewer students traveling, said
David Maas, a program assis-
tant at the center.
In the summers of 2007 and
2008, about 1,300 students
traveled abroad. However, in2009, UF sent 1,100 students
out of the country, a drop of
about 200.
Maas said students looking
for a reasonably priced experi-
ence can pay about $2,500 plus
airfare, but more people spend
$3,000 to $4,000. Some trips
can cost up to $10,000.
In addition, fewer student
travelers are relying on finan-
cial aid, Maas said.
"Students traveling during
a really hard economic shake
tend to be more affluent trav-
elers," Maas said. "Kids in the
middle are affected the most."
Despite these various chal-
lenges, Maas said UF's num-
bers have started to rebound,
and he is expecting about 1,200
Gators to visit a foreign desti-
nation this summer.
"I think students want to be
competitive in a global mar-
ketplace," Maas said. "Study
abroad can do that."By OLIVIA FELDMAN

Students will have food for
thought when UF hosts the
first Florida Food Summit next
week.
The summit, hosted by UF's
Office of Sustainability, will ed-
ucate the public through speech-
es and panel discussions about
sustainability, food systems and
Alachua County produce, said
Ashley Pennington, outreach
coordinator for the office.
"We live in such an agricul-
turally rich state," she said. "It's
exciting to allow people to see
what is available in our local
agriculture, how it is stored and
how it is provided to the com-
munity."The summit will consist of
three main events, including a
farmers market and two key-
note presentations.
On Monday, students will
have the opportunity to speak
with local farmers and buy pro-
duce from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on
the Reitz Union North Lawn.
Sean McLendon, sustainable
program manager
On of Alachua Coun-
Campus ty, will be speak-
ing during a panel
called Challenges and Oppor-
tunities for the Food System in
Alachua County Monday.
"It's rare that you get to have
all of the state food groups in
one place," McLendon said.
Admission is free, and most
events are open to the public.

Alligator StaffUF takes
merry-go-
round line-
up to UT
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achia ng@alligator org
Inconsistency has prevented the
Gators from putting out a consistent
lineup.
UF coach Kevin O'Sullivan still
can't pencil an everyday starter at
either of the corner-outfield spots
28 games into the season because of
streaky play.
Kamm Washington, Tyler
Thompson, Daniel Pigott and Jona-
than Pigott have all had opportu-
nities to win the two open outfield
jobs but haven't been able to do so.
As No.8 Florida (21-7,6-3 South-
eastern Conference) begins an eight-
game road trip tonight against Ten-
nessee (15-15, 2-7 SEC), O'Sullivan
would like to come home with the
problem resolved.
"A couple of those guys are go-
ing to have to sepa-
rate themselves in
the outfield," he
said. "It would be
Baseball nice to just write in
a lineup that you
stay with. I'm wait-
ing for one, two or three of those
guys just to separate."
None of the candidates for the
position have started more than
18 of the team's 28 games due to
inconsistent hitting. The four play-
ers vying for a starting spot have
combined for 60 strikeouts, which
means just less than one-third of the
team's punchouts are coming from
the two corner-outfield positions.
In the beginning of the season,
O'Sullivan would choose who
would start by pitching matchups.
If a lefty were starting, righties
Daniel and Jonathan would be in
the lineup. But if a righty were on
the mound, lefties Washington and
Thompson would be penciled in.
"Going lefty on lefty is kind of a
tough thing to do. It comes down to
mental makeup," Washington said.
"You can't chase pitches out of the
zone. I feel like it's on my part to

and they'll be looking for their
fifth top-five finish of the season
and their 17th win at their home
tournament.
"Obviously, playing on your
home course, in most cases, the
players feel a little bit more com-
fortable," UF coach Jan Dowling
said. "You're sleeping in your
own bed and you know the res-
taurants, all that sort of stuff, and
along with that they have great
memories on this golf course.
"Every single one of the play-ers has had great holes and great
rounds, and it provides a really

The Gators earned their last
title in this tournament in 2008,
when they finished
with a nine-over-

set the team tourna-Golf ment record.
UF will be the
highest-ranked team at the tour-

competing."We just need to take care of
our own business and not worry
about any outside factors that
we can't control," Dowling said.
"We're going to focus on the
things we can and see what hap-
pens."
Florida's lineup for the event
will be led by freshman Mia Pic-
cio, who finished first among her
teammates at the last tourna-
ment.
Junior Jessica Yadloczky, who
did not participate in the last
event, will return to the Gators'lineup. The veteran had UF's best
finish at last year's Gator Wom-
en's Golf Invitational.
Piccio and Yadloczky will be
joined by sophomores Evan Jens-

man Isabelle Lendl.
Florida will have four indi-
viduals participating, including
seniors Lauren Uzelatz and Ni-
cole Schachner, who will play
in the final home tournament of
their careers. Joining them will
be sophomore Andrea Watts and
freshman Megan Pak.

GATORS LACROSSE
UF looks to continue success with substitution offense
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
Injuries have forced Florida to
constantly adjust its offense, but
a new tactic and growing team
chemistry have led the Gators in
the right direction recently.
UF (8-4, 1-2 American Lacrosse
Conference) started the season
without Amanda Wedekind, Ra-
chel Smith, and Hayley Katzen-
berger, who suffered season-
ending injuries during the fall
and summer. The strain was then
put on the remaining players to
carry UF's offense in its grueling
60-minute games, but after lack-luster second halves, a change
had to be made.
On March 17 against Marist, UF
implemented a midfield substitu-
tion into its offense. The Gators
are 5-1 since then, and they have
garnered the No. 20 spot in the In-
side Lacrosse rankings.
This weekend, UF will look to
continue its substitution success
when it takes on Le Moyne at 4
p.m. Friday and Colgate at noon
Sunday, both on the road.
Florida coach Amanda O'Leary
began the first substitutions by
switching Rachael Zimmerman
and Kayla Stolins in for offense
and defense, respectively.She then mixed the combina-
tion, substituting Kitty Cullen in
with Stolins, and soon had Janine
Hillier and Cullen trading off.
The Gators, who had more
rested players
on both sides
'Iof the field and
could send of-
fensive plays
into the game
with the substi-
tutes, flourished
Cullen under the new
system, but inju-
ries would not stay away.
Midfielder-turned-attacker
Zimmerman went down witha season-ending torn left ACL
during the pre-game warm-up
against New Hampshire, and
midfielder Julie Schindel's season
ended with a right wrist injury in
late March. The two combined for
16 goals and six assists this sea-
son.
To offset the losses, O'Leary
continued the substitutions and
increased the pairs of substitutes.
"We really had no choice,"
O'Leary said. "We started out
with one, and then decided that
we needed to go with two coming
off the sidelines. It was something
we had thought about, but be-
cause of those injuries that we'vehad with Rachael and Julie, we
had to do something."
In addition to substitutions,
O'Leary and her players are tout-
ing team chemistry as the glue
that holds the offense together.
"We've really been clicking
well," midfielder Caroline Ches-
terman said. "It's been almost a
year now, and we're starting to
know what each other's strengths
are, so we play to that. We know
when that person is going to drive
or cut, and it's just been working
out really well."
Hillier added that communi-
cation and off-field bonding also
help with the offense.
Gators face tough foes in important conference battles
0 THE ME N'S TEAM WILL PLAY AT
HOME, AND THE WOMEN ARE ON
THE ROAD.
By ANDREW OLSON
Alligator Writer
The Southeastern Conference East stand-
ings in both men's and women's tennis will
be shaped by this weekend's matches.
The Gators men's tennis team is back
home for the final stretch of the regular sea-
son to face two of its toughest opponents this
spring.
No. 4 Tennessee (20-1, 8-0 SEC) will be the
highest-ranked team to face No. 6 UF (15-2,
7-0 SEC) in Gainesville today at 3 p.m.
Tennessee's only loss of the season camein the championship match of the ITA Na-
tional Team Indoor Tournament to the host,
current No. 1 Virginia.
One of Tennessee's strengths this season
has been doubles. The only time the Volun-
teers have lost the doubles point this season
was Sunday against Mississippi State.
If the Gators lose the doubles point Friday,
they know how to come back.
Last Sunday against then-No. 10 Ken-
tucky, UF needed sophomore Nassim Slilam
to win the third set of the last match to snag
the 4-3 win after losing the doubles point.
Slilam is not the only one who has been
pushed to three sets to win singles matches
on the road.
Senior Antoine Benneteau was pushed to
three sets against then-No. 14 Ole Miss and
then-No. 10 Kentucky, both 4-3 wins for UF.
"The key thing is I've improved on han-dling my emotions," Benneteau said. "I don't
get pissed off when the other guy is playing
well and comes back (to tie the match). When
I start the third set, I keep my composure and
I'm ready to fight."
UF will need to carry its fighting spirit
into Sunday when it faces No. 8 Georgia (16-
4, 8-0) at 1 p.m.
The Gators defeated the
Bulldogs 4-0 earlier this sea-
son in an ITA National TeamTennis Indoor Championships con-
solation match.
"I wouldn't have it any other way," UF
coach Andy Jackson said. "Our guys will
go out there Sunday knowing they can beat
Georgia."
The women's tennis team begins its three-
game road trip to close out the regular season
today in Knoxville, Tenn.The No. 4 Gators (18-2, 8-0 SEC) face No.
16 Tennessee (12-6, 6-2 SEC) today at 4 p.m.
From a rankings perspective, the match
will be the Gators' most difficult at a true
road environment this season.
The Gators traveled to Starkville, Miss., to
face then-No. 57 Mississippi State on March
26, but so far the only contests against top-
20 opponents away from Gainesville were at
February's ITA Team Indoor Championships
in neutral Madison, Wis.
No. 14 Georgia (11-5, 7-1 SEC) will be try-
ing for a piece of first place in the SEC East
when the Gators travel to Athens, Ga., for
Sunday's match at 1 p.m.
Much like the men's team, the women's
squad needs to defeat all three upcoming
SEC opponents to win the SEC East, and in
both cases the conference, outright.

UF SOFTBALL
Freshman duo leads Gators into Arkansas series
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
Coming into the season the junior bat-
tery of Stephanie Brombacher and Tiffany
DeFelice was expected to carry the bulk of
the load for the Gators.
But recently a pair of freshmen have
stepped up and proven to be solid contrib-
utors, and their emergence has done won-
ders for Florida's post-season chances.
The No. 4 Gators (27-4, 9-2 Southeast-
ern Conference) have overcome both the
inconsistencies of Brombacher and an in-
jury to DeFelice thanks largely to Ensley
Gammel and Brittany Schutte, who will
both have to be at the top of their game
as Florida travels to Arkansas (24-13, 8-3
SEC) for a weekend series.
"We had a couple freshman play out of
their minds this past week," UF coach Tim
Walton said. "Brittany Schutte and Ensley
Gammel really stepped up and were as ad-vertised from the recruiting scene."
Gammel has been dominant over her
last three outings on the mound, rebound-
ing from what was a poor start to her UF
career by throwing 15 innings without al-
lowing an earned run.
The freshman also went 3 for 3 at the
plate, and earned three of the team's four
wins en route to being named USA Soft-
ball's Collegiate Player of the Week.
"I was very, very surprised," Gammel
said of receiving the honor. "I couldn't
have done it by myself but it's very honor-
ing."
Gammel's battery mate for the vast ma-
jority of the past week has been Schutte,
who is second on the team with nine home
runs and 26 RBIs.
The new full-time catcher is only four
home runs and 17 RBIs behind Florida's
freshman records, which were set by Me-
gan Bush (home runs) in 2008 and Kristin
Sandler (RBIs) in 1997."It would be great as a goal to break
those records, but it's not really on my
mind," Schutte said. "I'm just trying to
perform to the best of my ability day in
and day out."
While Schutte has been a consistent
threat at the plate this season, she recently
proved that she is capable
of handling herself in
pressure situations.
On March 27, Schutte
sparked a comeback win
over Alabama, and four
days later delivered
Gammell game-tying and game-
winning hits against
UCF.
"I just try to tell myself it's just another
at-bat," Schutte said.
Schutte's emergence has come at the
perfect time, as DeFelice is expected to
be sidelined for another two weeks after
breaking a bone in her right hand whenshe was struck by a foul tip in the eighth
inning of last Wednesday's game against
UCF.
DeFelice, who struggled with an injury
to the tendon in her left wrist throughout
her first two seasons at UF, is still helping
the team any way she can by looking for
kinks in the pitcher's mechanics or trying
to steal signs.
"It gets really frustrating but unfortu-
nately in a situation like this there's really
nothing you can do about it," DeFelice
said.
"I'm handling it a lot better than I've
handled it before by being an active par-
ticipant in the dugout and being more up-
beat, whereas normally I would just get
quiet and not want to be the center of at-
tention."
Unlike Defelice's previous injury, it is
expected that the break will be out of her
way for good once the cast comes off.
Lineup shuffle sends Tucker to
outfield, Maddox to first base
BASEBALL, from page 16
take more initiative with that."
That method has changed.
After Thompson struck out four
times last Friday against Vanderbilt,
Daniel got the start Saturday and
Sunday in left field for the strug-
gling lefty. He went a combined
1 for 6 in those games, but he did
smack a home run Saturday while
also racking up three RBIs against
mostly right-handed pitching.
However, the up-and-down
trend continued. In the Gators' next
game against Jacksonville on Tues-
day, Daniel went hitless in his one
at-bat as a pinch hitter.
"They are showing glimpses, we
are just trying to look for some con-
sistency," O'Sullivan said.
But O'Sullivan has a plan to
combat his team's problems in the
outfield, and it could make its debut
tonight against the Volunteers.If third baseman Bryson Smith
returns to the lineup tonight, as ex-
pected, for the first time since suf-

20, O'Sullivan plans to shake things
up.
Sophomore Preston Tucker, who
usually plays first base, will move to
right field to make way for freshman
Austin Maddox, who has played
third in Smith's absence, at first.
"We've talked about that since
day one, but it looks like that
may happen as soon as Bryson is
healthy," O'Sullivan said.
These moves would allow Flor-
ida to keep Brian Johnson as the
designated hitter. But more impor-
tantly, it provides a temporary fix
at one of the corner-outfield spots
as Tucker would be moving to right
field.
"Whether we stay with it is to-
tally up to the players," O'Sullivan
said. "But that is certainly a change
that we are looking at."narrsan uiamanu /RMigratr alai
UF's Preston Tucker will move to right field, which he played in high school, and Austin Maddox will slide
to first base to replace him.
