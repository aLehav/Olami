Jake Rush is running for 
U.S. Congress. He’s a lawyer. 
And, sometimes, when he’s not working, he’s also Lord Staas van der Winst. 
The candidate up against in-
cumbent Gainesville Tea Party Congressman Ted Yoho has drawn criticism in the past week after the SaintPetersblog pub-lished a post calling out Rush for taking part in supernatural role-playing games. Since then, the story has been picked up by 
national publications like Van-
ity Fair and Gawker. 
The blog cited message 
board posts made by Chazz Darling, supposedly one of Rush’s online personas, that insinuated sexually assaulting another character.
Rush is open about his in-
volvement in acting and role-playing. In the Gainesville 
chapter of fantasy-themed 
gaming and acting community The Camarilla, he portrays the character listed as Lord Staas van der Winst on the group’s Wikipedia page.
But his campaign says some 
critics are rushing to inaccurate conclusions about the implica-
tions of his hobbies.
Alex Patton, a campaign 
spokesman, said the blog spun 
Rush’s involvement in gaming and acting as “Satan worship.”

UF students hoping to visit  
Dallas for the Final Four this 
weekend can make their trip easy 
with several travel package ar-
rangements. The Gainesville-based Luxury 
Travel Institute and the Univer-
sity Athletic Association are pro-
viding students with four-day travel packages that include bus tickets and hotel accommoda-tions.
The company has 52 spots open for $339 per person. The 
trip includes round-trip coach 
transportation as well as a four-night stay at a hotel. The package also provides transfers from the hotel to Gators pep rallies and 
the games, said Andy Bailey, the 
company’s president. 
He said he has been running 
sports-oriented trips since Steve 
Spurrier was at UF. He said he provides these student packages because the company’s roots are 
in the university community — Bailey founded the company about 30 years ago while he was a UF student. 
“You gotta take care of the 
people who took care of you,” Bailey said. 
The University Athletic Asso-
ciation is also offering packages to students who attended three 
or more home basketball games 
this year. 
Jonathan Arnholz, vice presi-
dent of the Men’s Basketball Rowdies, said his organization 
has been pushing the whole sea-
son for a bus package from the UAA if the Gators advanced to the Final Four.Final Four-teen hour drive? Gators plan Dallas trips

For students wondering where 
the emails that ﬁ  ll their Webmail  
spam folders come from, there’s more to the process than someone on the other end clicking the send 
button. 
Spring has seen recurring 
emails in students’ university ac-
counts for an online college net-working service called Cluster-Flunk. Founder AJ Nelson wrote in an email that the website ﬁ  led a public records request to UF at the beginning of the semester for 
a list of students’ email addresses 
and majors.
Although federal law under 
the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act protects students’ information, not all of it remains private. “Directory information,” or details deemed not harmful or an invasion of privacy, are avail-
able to the public upon request. 
Such is the case at UF, where for a $100 ﬂ  at fee, anyone can ob-
tain a student’s information: their name; email address; phone num-ber; local and permanent address; major; class and college; enroll-ment status; date of attendance; degrees and awards received; previous educational institutions 
attended; weight and height of 
university athletes; publication titles for dissertations; and nature and place of employment at UF. 
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
wrote in an email that the univer-sity receives about 15 of these re-quests per semester. 
“The University of Florida is 
required by law to provide direc-tory information on its students, faculty and staff if requested,” Sikes said. “Like students, faculty and staff also receive unwanted 
email from vendors. Some of it 
ends up in our spam ﬁ  lters and some gets through, nonetheless.”
While she said the university 
hasn’t received complaints re-garding spam emails, Cluster-Flunk’s emails aren’t just going into spam folders.

Sen. Davis Bean, the chair of the budget and appropriations committee, talks Tuesday evening 
about the academic and student organizational budget for the 2014-2015 ﬁ  scal year.
STUDENT GOVERNMENT
HANNA MARCUS
Alligator Staff Writer hmarcus@alligator.org
In Tuesday night’s Senate meeting, 71 
senators unanimously passed two resolu-
tions and got their ﬁ  rst peek at the proposed organizational budget for the 2014-2015 ﬁ  s-cal year.
Sen. Davis Bean, chair of the budget and 
allocations committee, presented the pro-posed budget. The money will go to aca-demic and student organizations.
Bean said his committee spent more than  
50 hours on the budget.
“It really is a big and tedious process go-
ing line item by line item through all these (organizations’) budgets,” he said, “but it’s 
something I enjoy and know the committee 
enjoys as well.”
The student organization budget totaled 
about $1 million. The budget committee met with 48 student organizations in about 26 hours.
Of these student organizations, three 
new groups will receive money from SG:  the Iranian Student Association, PhDMoms and WiSE. Other groups, like Gator Raiders, Pro-Life Alliance and Student Animal Alli-ance, fell out of the budget cycle.
The budget also allocates about $425,000 
to 20 academic organizations.
In addition to the presentation, senators 
unanimously passed two resolutions.
The ﬁ  rst resolution honored the life and 
legacy of Reubin Askew, a Florida governor who recently died. The second resolution supported a strategic response discourag-
ing racism on campus. This resolution was 
in response to the derogatory ﬂ  iers posted Feb. 26 aimed at Asian-Americans saying “Wanted Dog for Cash.”Senate sees academic and

“It really is a big and tedious 
process going line item by 
line item through all these 
(organizations’) budgets, but it’s 
something I enjoy and know the 
committee enjoys as well.”
Sen. Davis Bean
budget and allocations committee chairwas mischaracterized by his oppo-
sition as a “political hack job.” But, he said, “you kind of expect these things when you’re campaigning.”
The Alligator could not reach 
Yoho for comment. 
In a statement, Rush said that as 
a Christian, he was “deeply offend-ed that the opposing campaign and their supporters would take a gam-ing and theatre hobby and mischar-acterize it.” He also indirectly ad-dressed allegations about the posts.
“The very definition of acting is 
expressing ideas and thoughts that are not your own,” he said.
But some Gainesville community 
members seemed unfazed and even positive about Rush’s hobbies. 
Harry Beck, a 21-year-old UF 
anthropology junior who is the sec-retary for the campus tabletop gam-ing club Delta Nu Delta, said Rush 
would likely “get a lot of respect 
from the nerd community.”
“I think it makes him a lot more 
human,” Beck said.
He noted gaming and role-play-
ing are simply hobbies that shouldn’t be considered odd in context. “Everyone has something that 
they take part in to blow off steam,” he said. “Some people go out to 
nightclubs. Some people go hunt-
ing. Other people play games with friends, and some people LARP.”
Journalism junior Lawrence 
Chan, the 21-year-old main organiz-er for SwampCon, an anime, gam-ing and sci-fi gathering at UF, said rumors about Rush’s private hob-
bies shouldn’t impact his campaign.
Rush and Yoho will face off in 
the Aug. 26 Republican primary. 
The general election for the District 3 congressional seat will be Nov. 4.

ClusterFlunk’s emails vis-ited his typically spam-free inbox. Within three weeks, three more emails appeared. 
Stone took his concerns to 
Twitter, where he questioned ClusterFlunk on where it obtained his email. Cluster-Flunk apologized and re-moved him from its mailing list. 
He said his issue isn’t 
with ClusterFlunk but with 
its cluttering of email ac-
counts reserved for educa-tional purposes. 
“If everyone found out 
about this practice, if com-panies started automatically doing this — it’ll be worse than your personal email,” he said. 
As a teacher of an online 
course for the College of Journalism and Communi-
cations, Stone’s main mode 
of communication with his students is through email, he said. 
If the volume of spam 
emails picks up in UF email accounts, he’s worried his students won’t be able to see his emails or check their in-
boxes at all. 
Although students can’t 
stop anyone from request-
ing their information, steps can be taken to shield their inboxes from spam.

For Gainesville’s homeless resi-
dents, the city’s former correctional 
facility couldn’t become a shelter any sooner: One of the property owners of Tent City plans to evict 
residents.
The owner wants to clear his 
property before selling it, and with 
the eviction looming, the Alachua County Coalition for the Home-less and Hungry is suggesting resi-dents head to the new shelter, called Gainesville Regional Area Com-munity Empowerment, or GRACE Marketplace, when it opens next month.
“It’s a shame because some of 
these people have been there for 
many years,” said Theresa Lowe, 
executive director for the coalition. 
Come May 1, when the shelter opens, displaced homeless residents could find a new home on Northeast 39th Avenue.
The shelter is set to provide space 
for about 100 people, Lowe said.
City Commissioner Todd Chase 
first suggested converting the facil-ity to a shelter.  He said he can’t say for sure if Tent City residents will flock there but hopes the building will provide relief to any residents trying to get back on their feet.
“For me, the issue of homeless-
ness has come down to trying to provide opportunities to help the  people that want help,” Chase said. “My main hope is that people come to the center.”
Meanwhile, nearby business 
owners who heard of the Tent City eviction said, “it’s about time.”Miguel Figueroa said he tries not 
to “judge anyone,” but running a repair service for high-end BMWs 
around the community has been a 
challenge.
“It’s never been good for busi-
ness,” said Figueroa, owner of Best Motor Works, located at 65 SE 10th Ave.
He said the constant “exposure,” 
whether people are walking around or begging for money, alienated 
some clientele.  “We’ve been trying 
to be as politically correct or nice as possible,” he said.

The future is rich for bone cancer research, 
thanks to a new discovery by a team of UF vet-
erinary researchers.
Dr. Valery Scharf and her team found a 
gold-based drug may slow the growth of os-
teosarcoma, or bone cancer tumors, in dogs 
and people.
Scharf said osteosarcoma develops when 
a group of bone cells become abnormal and start multiplying rapidly. It is typically treated either by surgically removing the tumor or using radiation therapy to kill the abnormal cells.
Although these methods treat the tumor 
locally, Scharf said they don’t stop the micro-scopic spread of the cancer cells to the lungs, which is the major issue with this type of disease. She said by the time the tumor is re-moved, cancer is usually already affecting the 
lungs.
“The life expectancy with those treatments 
is still often around a year in dogs,” she said. 
“So what we’re looking for are different medi-cations that we can use to make that time pe-riod longer.”
The drug aurothiomalate, or gold salts, had previously shown positive results fight-ing lung cancer in humans. Scharf said her ap-proach was to take this research and see if it would be effective in dogs and cats.
“A lot of the good chemotherapy drugs 
have had a metal molecule in them,” she said.  
“So that’s why people decided to start looking 
at gold and seeing if it had similar effects.”Although it’s not shiny like gold, Scharf 
said the yellow compound has shown positive results slowing tumor growth both in petri dishes and in mice. Scharf said her team still has a lot of research to do before the drug can be used on animals or humans.
Larissa Menke, a 21-year-old UF marine 
science senior, said this discovery promotes “one health,” the idea that the same medicines can be used to treat animals and humans.
“That’s exactly what I want to do, applying 
it to humans as well,” she said. “It’s definitely becoming more common, which is a really im-portant thing for world health.”

Eligible UF students can buy tickets for the game(s) for $40
The association delivered with a travel package that 
includes $30 round-trip bus tickets and hotel rooms at the 
Hilton Anatole for about $250 per room per night. Rooms 
can fit up to four students. The package is only eligible for 
100 UF students who bought tickets through the student sale, according to a UAA press release.   
Eligible students can buy tickets for both the Final Four 
and the national championship for $40 total, said Alicia Longworth, marketing and promotions assistant athletic director.
Buses for both travel packages will depart Gainesville 
Thursday night and arrive in Dallas on Friday morning. Students will arrive back to Gainesville on Tuesday after 
the national championship game Monday.    
For students staying in Gainesville, Arnholz said the 
athletic association will hold a watch party in the Stephen 
C. O’Connell Center if the Gators advance to the national championship.Jake Sillick, last season’s president of the Men’s Bas-
ketball Rowdies, traveled to the Final Four tournament in 2007 and plans to utilize the UAA’s travel package this year. 
The 25-year-old UF computer and electrical engineer-
ing major said the students’ presence will give the team a boost.

Gainesville Police arrested a 
local man Friday following accu-
sations that he and another man 
picked up a woman from a Mid-
town bar, took her to a hotel and raped her.Officers arrested 21-year-old 
Jaser Almutair on charges of sexual battery, according to an arrest re-port. 
A second suspect has not been 
arrested.
At about 2:20 a.m. Saturday, Al-
mutair told police he and another man met the vic-
tim on the dance floor of Gator City. She was too 
drunk to remem-
ber her name or where she lived, he said. 
Almutair said 
they were going to take her home, but she made a sexual reference so they decided to take her to a hotel, according to the report. He denied the victim ever said no. 
In the hotel bathroom, the vic-
tim tried to call her friend for help, but her phone was dead. She told police she remembered vomiting and feeling scared — she didn’t 
know where she was, according to 
the report.
She told police she eventually laid on one of the beds, and both men forced themselves on her de-spite her protests.
Afterward, the two men bought 
food at a Burger King drive-thru and dropped her off at her apart-ment, according to the report.
Officers booked Almutair into 
the Alachua County Jail at 11:56 p.m., where he remained as of press time in lieu of a $1 million bond.

David Habib grins from 
ear to ear when he talks about 
Molly Oloyi, the namesake of his nonprofit organization, Molly’s Beads.
UF dual-degree junior 
Habib, 21, received a 2014 Newman Civic Fellows Award for his work with Molly’s Beads and his in-volvement and dedication to service at UF and abroad.
Habib was one of 197 
people selected to receive the 
award, given to college stu-
dents who make a difference in others’ lives.
Habib said his parents 
raised him to “have a basic awareness that many people aren’t as privileged as we are here in America.”
“It started with that ba-
sic awareness when I was young,” he said. “It wasn’t until I stepped out of my comfort zone and went on an airplane with people I didn’t know to Africa, where I really felt my calling to service.”
On a medical mission trip 
in 2010, Habib met Molly 
Oloyi, a woman who made 
jewelry out of recycled maga-zine paper to pay for her HIV medicine.
Oloyi was, according to 
Habib, a “mother to all” who translated for the mission group, sewed, crafted and educated local children.
“I immediately felt a con-
nection with her,” Habib said.
After leaving Uganda, 
Habib received an email from Oloyi asking him to sell her beads in America, followed by a shipment of 270 pieces of handmade jewelry. 
Habib created a nonprofit 
organization to sell the jew-elry, which he called Molly’s Beads.
The following year’s ship-
ment contained 1,300 bead-ed pieces of jewelry, which Molly’s Beads sold, earning $11,000 for Oloyi and her community.
Habib’s mark has extended 
to the Gainesville community as well, where he worked with 
the One Campaign against 
world poverty as well as the Ronald McDonald House.
Nicole Matuska, a 21-year-
old University of North Florida marketing junior, is Habib’s close friend and co-founder of Molly’s Beads. She said Habib’s character is ap-
parent in his interactions with 
others.
“David has always been 
one to put others first, which is awesome, but he’s also one that brings out the best in oth-er people,” Matuska said. “He inspires others to be the best that they can be.”UF student wins

Gainesville Regional Utilities is partnering 
with Trimark Properties in the development 
of an electrical meter communication system.
The Advanced Meter Infrastructure is be-
ing developed by GRU in Trimark’s newest 
property, Savion Park Luxury Apartments, 
opening in August on Southwest Fifth Av-enue.
David Lea, AMI project manager at GRU, said the system makes electrical operations more efficient.
“It allows us to communicate with those 
(meters) and operate those from the office without sending people and equipment out into the field,” he said.
Additionally, customers will be able to spe-
cifically monitor their energy usage and how it’s being used every day, he said.
Lea said GRU is testing other meters within 
Innovation Square businesses and a couple other apartment complexes.Rob Edmunds, the development and con-
struction manager at Trimark, said GRU ap-proached Trimark and asked if it could test its new smart meters on the Savion complex as a part of its pilot program.
Savion tenants will benefit from same-day service rather than having to call, make an ap-pointment and wait for ground personnel, he said.
Josh Steppling, marketing and communi-
cations associate at Trimark Properties, said he thinks GRU wants to make it a positive experi-ence for the consumer.
“Their plans are to make it so that people 
in the future can form a budget, track their 
spending throughout the month and submit 
payments,” Steppling said. “It’s going to save people a lot of time and money.” Upcoming apartment complex to have new type of electric meter

UF students are gearing up for 
the frenzy of the Final Four, and the 
success of the men’s basketball team has the Florida bookstores scram-bling to accommodate the impend-
ing rush.
The UF Bookstore has more than 
900 Final Four T-shirts ready for stu-
dents and fans to purchase, said Pa-mela Grasso, UF Bookstore general merchandise manager.She said the most popular item 
will be the T-shirts the team was sporting just after Saturday’s win. 
“Students want to be a part of it,” 
Grasso said. “They want to repre-
sent something specific about bas-
ketball.”
During the past few home games, 
the store was packed and sold out of 
certain merchandise, she said. The 
bookstore is bringing in temporary employees to ease the frenzy.
Alumni Hall, located at 3730 SW 
Archer Road, has also felt the de-mand for basketball attire, said store manager Paloma Puig. 
“We are really excited to be open 
for the Final Four,, since we have only been open for five months,” she said.
Anh Dang, a 22-year-old UF den-
tal graduate student, was searching for the perfect Final Four T-shirt for her fiance. She said the tournament gives students something to look 
forward to on weekends when they 
don’t have to study.

the dark LARPs: 
a Jake Rush story
Jake Rush caught the attention of websites like Gawker when 
reports surfaced of the Alachua Republican lawyer’s involve-ment with live-action role-playing games. During his under-
graduate years at UF, Rush was part of The Camarilla, the UF chapter of an international gaming society. Around 2009, under 
the name of his gaming alter ego Chazz Darling, Rush posted 
messages in a gaming forum with violent and sexual threats, ac-cording to Gawker.
While the story admittedly made for a great read-it-laugh-
once-and-forget-it Gawker post, complete with excerpts of a 2010 Chazz Darling post in which he threatens rape on a pre-sumably female character, it probably won’t have much effect on his campaign. 
What the online stories and inevitable late-night talk show 
hosts won’t mention is that Gainesville residents aren’t up in arms over the news, even though Rush and Gainesville voters as a whole are pretty conservative. 
The comments on online stories about Rush’s afﬁ  nity for 
LARPing are overwhelmingly positive and forgiving. 
Most of them voiced the same sentiment: Who cares what 
Rush does in his free time?
And, to his credit, Rush has been forthcoming about his 
LARPing. 
According to the Miami Herald, he said, “As a practicing 
Christian, I am deeply offended that the opposing campaign and their supporters would take a gaming and theatre hobby and mischaracterize it. The very deﬁ  nition of acting is express-ing ideas and thoughts that are not your own, just like I don’t believe I am MacBeth, which I have played, I am none of the characters.”
He has a point. And while the Yoho camp and a handful of 
online media outlets have gleefully used the news to try to hu-
miliate the rookie politician, Rush has handled the scrutiny with 
poise. 
We believe that Rush’s logic holds up. After all, constant 
readers of Cormac McCarthy, Stephen King and George R. R. Martin — masters of gore and terrifying sex scenes — don’t assume that the writers’ ﬁ  ction reﬂ  ects their morality. Quen-tin Tarantino directs some of the bloodiest, most graphic ﬁ  lms American audiences have ever seen, but viewers don’t believe his art reﬂ  ects a serious character ﬂ  aw. What Rush chooses to do 
in his spare time, as long as he’s not harming himself or others, 
is irrelevant to his politics. 
In the grand scheme of politicians’ bad behavior — like, 
say, banging your intern and then lying to a grand jury about it — playing a vampire role-playing game in which all parties involved are accepting of the adult content isn’t that bad. 
The climate is right for Rush to swoop in and claim a vic-
tory over Yoho, who’s been the laughingstock of Congress since claiming Obamacare is racist and making light of starvation and 
poverty in America. 
Will a little strange press get in Rush’s way?
Probably not.Throughout his administration, Gov. Rick Scott has been a ﬁ  erce opponent of the Patient Protection and Afford-able Care Act, more often referred to as “Obamacare.”
After the act passed in 2010, Scott refused to set up an on-
line health care exchange for the state of Florida. In addition, 
the Scott administration’s Department of Health banned 
“navigators,” counselors authorized by the act to help sign people up for insurance, from county health departments.
Until recently, the governor also opposed the expansion 
of Medicaid included in the act. Although he recently ex-pressed his support for a limited Medicaid expansion, the Republican-dominated Florida Legislature rejected the pro-posal.
The Legislature’s failure to expand Medicaid means that 
up to 1.3 million Floridians who would have otherwise been eligible for the program will not have that opportunity.
Republicans at the federal level have demonstrated a sim-
ilar hostility toward Obamacare. On March 5, House Repub-licans voted for the 50th time to repeal the law, a symbolic measure that has no chance of advancing as long as Demo-crats control the White House and the Senate.
Despite the governor’s best attempts, the Legislature and 
Republicans in Congress, Obamacare appears to be succeed-
ing in the Sunshine State.
The Associated Press reported that more than 440,000 
Floridians have signed up for health insurance through the 
online federal marketplace at healthcare.gov. This ﬁ  gure means that Florida is on track to surpass the Congressional Budget Ofﬁ  ce’s initial projections for insurance enrollment in the state. 
The success of Obamacare in Florida can largely be cred-
ited to the efforts of nonproﬁ  t groups like Enroll America as 
well as federal funding for advertising and outreach efforts.
Republican attempts to sabotage Obamacare offer a 
marked contrast to the last large-scale rollout of a federal 
health care program.
In 2003, former President George W. Bush signed the 
Medicare Modernization Act into law. The MMA included a massive new prescription drug beneﬁ  t program for Ameri-can senior citizens known as Medicare Part D.Medicare Part D experienced 
signiﬁ  cant issues in its implemen-tation, just as Obamacare did. 
Democrats in Congress and 
around the country could have 
seized on the initial failure of the 
MMA in order to beneﬁ  t political-ly. Instead, Democrats dedicated themselves to ensuring that the program was ﬁ  xed and imple-
mented properly.
Then-Wisconsin Senator Herb Kohl encouraged his fel-
low Democrats to “put aside any partisan thoughts to work together to get this program running.”
Hillary Clinton, then a senator from New York, had this 
to say about Medicare Part D:
“I voted against it, but once it passed, I certainly deter-
mined that I would try to do everything I could to make sure that New Yorkers understood it, could access it and make the best of it.”
Although Medicare Part D remains ﬂ  awed, the joint ef-
forts of Republicans and Democrats helped it grow into a program that now provides millions of senior citizens with 
affordable prescription drugs.
The Affordable Care Act is not perfect. Its reliance on the 
private insurance market will result in higher health care 
costs than a publicly ﬁ  nanced, single-payer health care sys-tem. 
However, Obamacare has helped millions of Americans 
gain access to reasonably affordable health insurance, even with a massive contingent of the political establishment working to sabotage it. How much more successful would 
the law be if members of both parties worked together to-
ward its improvement?
Rather than seeking to destroy Obamacare for political 
gain, Scott and his fellow Republicans should put their ef-fort into making the law work as effectively and efﬁ  ciently as possible.

For the past few weeks, the left has 
been hell-bent on criticizing Re-publican campaign donors. The 
overwhelming amount of this one-sid-ed smearing and demonization borders on the absurd.
While delivering a speech on the 
Senate ﬂ  oor, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ventured to say that the Koch Brothers, two of the most inﬂ  u-ential Republican donors, are “un-American” and have every intention to “buy America.” America is 
“addicted to Koch,” as the senator put it. The media 
and even columnists in this newspaper have cham-pioned this cause. They have taken up the arduous duty of attacking not only rich Americans but also 
conservative ones at that.
Let’s clear the air before we move on: I complete-
ly understand if you are of the persuasion that cam-
paign ﬁ  nance is out of control and dark money has taken over politics. 
If you still hold this belief, you must also decry 
the efforts on the left to outspend and out-raise the mega-donors on the right. That would only be fair.
The partisans mentioned have criticized the 
Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson and other Repub-lican donors ad nauseam, yet remained silent on criticizing donors on the left.
This reeks of blatant and rampant hypocrisy at 
its ﬁ  nest. 
While these self-righteous commentators and 
politicians wave their hands in the sky and curse the names of these right-wing donors, they turn a blind eye to the big-pocket spenders who help them 
and their interests.
While this ﬁ  st-waving and hand-wringing en-
sues, the number of facts disregarded mounts.
During the past campaign cycle, President Barack 
Obama outspent Gov. Mitt Romney 7-to-1. Where is Sen. Harry Reid’s ﬂ  oor speech criticizing the dark 
money that ﬁ  nanced the Obama campaign?
Democratic billionaire donor George Soros was 
instrumental in attacking the Bush agenda. Are So-
ros’ actions un-American? Reid has yet to comment 
on this.
In this election cycle Tom Steyer, a billionaire hedge fund manager, vows to push more than $100 million to Democratic candidates supporting green initia-
tives. 
I have yet to read a scathing article 
about this development in the Alliga-
tor’s opinion section.
All the righteous indignation aside, 
we can turn to Reid’s campaign to il-luminate and educate us on the proper 
way to conduct ofﬁ  cial campaign business, if only that were the case. The senator’s campaign bought 
$17,000 worth of jewelry from — of all people — his 
granddaughter.
Ignoring facts is one thing, but wrongfully call-
ing a group of people un-American is disgusting. 
And — surprise — more facts are omitted when one 
makes this claim.
Turning to the Koch brothers, the two have do-
nated countless sums to the arts, the state of New York and cancer research. Believe it or not, they have 
even donated money to Democratic campaigns. 
How is this considered un-American? 
If this were more widely known, the brothers 
would be painted in a completely different light 
than they are now. 
But then again, why let reality get in the way of 
one’s politics?
In addition to this, why are so many on the left 
so critical of how people — people with whom they disagree — spend their own money? 
Everyone is entitled to spend his or her own 
money where he or she pleases. 
If donors want to ﬁ  nance political commercials 
that will force unsuspecting viewers to either curse 
at the ad or search their couches for the remote con-trol, that is their prerogative. Then again, Demo-crats do enjoy controlling other people’s money.
Campaign ﬁ  nance is a big issue that will con-
tinue to polarize as the amount of money raised increases.
But when criticizing this issue, leave the partisan 
rancor at the door and do a little research before 
making damaging assertions.

opinions@alligator.org Have you ever taken a prerequisite that was worse than a 
middle school algebra class? 
We know how you feel. 
Thankfully, we have a few tips that’ll 
encourage you to enjoy going to class, no matter how similar your professor sounds to Ben Stein from the eye drops 
commercials.
Reward yourself:
When studying for classes, trying to get through 10 pages of a 
textbook can feel like you are reading a lot of meaningless words meshed together. If this happens, create short-term goals. After 
ﬁ  nishing a whole chapter, you and your roommates are entitled 
to a spontaneous early-2000s-throwback dance party.
Friends:Designate a friend in your class to get coffee with 
beforehand. 
If you force each other to wake up every Monday, Wednesday 
and Friday to grab a bagel and some coffee before class, you will be obligated to get up for the sake of your friend. Make sure this friend is interesting or has interesting things to tell you about his 
or her juicy life so that you are actually encouraged to wake up.
Crushes:
Designate a class crush. As silly as this sounds, it works. Waking up for a discussion 
is a lot easier when you know you’ll be sitting next to a hottie (intellectual or physical hottie, of course). This could be your attractive TA, that cute kid who somehow knows the answer to every question, or even the mysterious student in the corner who is always sipping from a Thermos ﬁ  lled with who knows what.
Games:Make going to class a game. Give yourself points for tasks that would be otherwise trivial. 
Competing with your friends from class makes this even better. 
Create a Google Doc for all your class friends to partake in your 
ridiculous game. Five points for making a clever comment in a discussion section. Ten points if you actually answer a question with a nonbulls**t answer.

Keira Hornyak is trying 
to chomp her way into Tim 
Tebow’s heart. She’s asking 
him to a military ball in the 
hope of securing him as an 
endorsement for her upcom-
ing cystic fibrosis fundraiser.
Hornyak, a 19-year-old UF 
political science freshman, made a YouTube video slide-show to share her message. The video includes pictures 
of Hornyak posing in  iconic 
campus locations with signs asking Tebow to be her date.
“The ball is about celebrat-
ing what the Army stands 
for, and I want to share that 
with Tebow,” she said.
Hornyak said she has ad-
mired Tebow for a long time and wanted a unique reason 
to gain his attention for her fundraiser. The Cystic Fi-
brosis Climb, benefiting the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, is planned for Fall 2014.
The fundraiser will be a 
fitness event in Ben Hill Grif-fin Stadium. 
It is designed to be a chal-
lenging course representing climbing to new heights in 
finding the cure.
Hornyak’s inspiration for 
creating the event lies in her 
friend Chase Honeycutt, a 19-year-old Santa Fe College 
business sophomore who has 
cystic fibrosis.
She said he works hard-
er than a lot of people she knows and changed her view on life.
“If he can get up and do 
everything he does in a nor-
mal day, then I have no ex-
cuse to not do what I am sup-posed to be doing,” Hornyak said.
Honeycutt said this fund-
raiser has great potential to raise both awareness and money for the Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation. 
He said he also hopes to 
see the North Central Florida 
chapter of the Cystic Fibro-sis Foundation benefit from 
their work.
“I think it is a great oppor-
tunity for the university and 
the CF foundation, and I just really hope it works out,” 
Honeycutt said.
Although he may not get 
the chance to take Tebow 
out on a date like Hornyak, Honeycutt praised her ef-forts to gain his support in the cause.
“It takes a lot of courage 
to do something like that,” he said. “I think it is a great idea to get him involved.”8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2, 2014

MIAMI  — A celebrity photographer sought to boost 
the potential damages he could win from Justin Bieber 
in a lawsuit that accuses the singer and a bodyguard of 
battery in a confrontation outside a recording studio.
The photographer’s attorney, Mark DiCowden, said 
at a Tuesday hearing that he has documented at least 11 similar alleged assaults against photographers over two years involving Bieber and his security personnel. 
DiCowden said a punitive damage award for Jeffrey 
Binion could deter future assaults against celebrity photographers, known as “paparazzi.”
“It’s not a financial fishing expedition,” DiCowden 
said in asking Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Sarah Zabel to allow him to pursue unspecified punitive damages. 
“It is well known around the world that Justin Bieber 
does not like to be photographed in public.”
Zabel did not immediately rule. Bieber attorney 
Jared Lopez said there is no evidence that Binion was physically harmed in the alleged attack in June — meaning compensatory damages for the photographer 
might be minimal — and no proof that Bieber himself told bodyguard Hugo Hesny to go after Binion.
“I don’t tell security how to do their job,” Bieber said 
in a March deposition in the case, according to Lopez.
Outside the courtroom, Bieber attorney Roy Black 
called the lawsuit “frivolous” and intended mainly to 
generate publicity.
Hesny is facing a misdemeanor battery charge in 
the Binion case, and he was also recently charged in another photographer confrontation in Atlanta. Other 
incidents involving Bieber bodyguards have occurred 
in Los Angeles and Hawaii, according to court papers.
Separately, Bieber has pleaded not guilty to DUI, re-
sisting arrest and driving with an expired license after a Jan. 23 arrest in Miami Beach.

On a narrow street off Millhopper Road, there’s a quiet 
neighborhood lined with trees. The place smelled of burnt 
wood, and on Monday evening, the silence was only broken by birds chirping in the distance. 
But earlier that day, the sounds of gunshots filled the air. 
At about 4:30 p.m., Randall J. Smith dialed 911 from the 
neighborhood located at Northwest 69th Drive. He said he had 
just shot a man several times.
Alachua County Sheriff’s deputies arrested the 54-year-old 
on a homicide charge after he allegedly murdered his neighbor, according to an arrest report. 
When law enforcement arrived, Smith 
was still on the phone with dispatch. He fol-lowed instructions to put down his gun and 
was detained, according to the report.  First 
responders tried to help the victim, Michael Carreiro, but he was pronounced dead on the scene. He was 47. 
During questioning, Smith said he and 
Carreiro had a history of disputes. He gave 
police the following account: Before making 
the call, Smith was spraying herbicide to treat poison ivy on the side of the drive when he noticed a car coming. He saw it was 
Carreiro and started walking back toward his house. But when 
he turned around, he noticed Carreiro had stopped and was walking briskly toward him. 
Smith said he walked toward Carreiro with his hands up, 
prompting Carreiro to yell “What the f*** are you doing?” Smith stopped heading toward him, but Carreiro kept advanc-ing and threatened to kill him and his family. 
That’s when Smith reached behind his back for his law-
fully concealed gun. Smith drew the gun, and Carreiro said he  
wouldn’t use it, Smith said. 
Smith fired the gun rapidly, and Carreiro fell to the ground, 
face down. His arms were tucked under him, and he wasn’t 
moving. Smith waited a few seconds, then fired two more rounds into his back. Officers found 14 shell casings.
The men had been neighbors for nearly 10 years, and Car-
reiro did not approve of Smith’s property maintenance on Northwest 69th Drive. Smith said the deceased had made vio-lent threats toward him in the past.
Smith made several reports to the sheriff’s office in 2013 to 
try to resolve the conflicts, according to the report. He said the last time he heard from Carreiro before the shooting was after he spoke with Carreiro’s probation officer in the fall. 
Officers booked Smith into the Alachua County Jail at about 
12:20 a.m. Tuesday, where he remained as of press time in lieu of a $1 million bond.Man arrested after

UF students and staff will no 
longer have to log into the “visitor” 
level Internet access when visiting other institutions with the addition of a new secure wireless network.
Eduroam is a secure, worldwide 
roaming access service developed for international research and the educational community. UF imple-mented the service last month. 
Tracy Gale, communications 
manager for UF Information Tech-nology, said having eduroam grants quick Internet access for stu-
dents visiting campuses around the 
world.
“If the research facility is a mem-
ber of eduroam, the student or fac-ulty member does not have to wait for anything to be processed,” Gale wrote in an email. “They can get on-line, check email and get to work.”
Anyone with a current Gator-
Link is automatically granted access to another participating institution’s network.
“Before eduroam, visitors to UF 
would need to request a temporary GatorLink credential,” Gale said. 
Now, students visiting other 
universities will have immediate access because their identity is al-ready confirmed, she said.
The new network allows univer-sities to better manage who is con-necting to their Wi-Fi network.
“There are people who (corrupt 
networks to) steal research data or personal information, like So-cial Security numbers and patient records,” Gale said. “Universities have to be vigilant.”
To prepare a device for eduroam, 
users should confirm that the eduroam connection link appears on their wireless device, log in and 
then save the login credentials, ac-
cording to UFIT’s website. This will allow the device to connect at any eduroam member university or fa-cility.
Eduroam is available in 54 coun-
tries and more than 5,000 institu-tions, according to the website. 
Mary Ann Ferguson, a public 
relations professor and researcher at UF, travels frequently and said eduroam will be helpful for her and her students.

she said.UF joins new secure wireless network

TALLAHASSEE — Gov. Rick 
Scott signed four bills Tuesday 
that will keep the most violent sexual offenders locked up longer and close loopholes in a law that 
allows the state to send predators 
to a high-security treatment center even after they’ve ﬁ  nished their prison sentences.
The bills were a priority for 
Democrats and Republicans in both chambers and were largely inspired by the death of 8-year-old Cherish Perrywinkle, whose photo 
was held behind Scott as he signed 
the bills. Authorities said Perry-winkle was abducted and killed by a repeat sexual offender less than a month after he ﬁ  nished a jail sen-tence in a case where he targeted another young girl.
“As a father of two girls and 
the grandfather of three little boys, 
I think about how the legislation I’m signing today will affect Flor-
ida’s families. It will make Florida safer,” Scott said. “I want Florida to be the best state in the nation for 
raising a family, and this legisla-
tion will help make this a reality.” 
The wide-ranging package 
creates a mandatory 50-year sen-tence for people who rape chil-dren younger than 12, the devel-opmentally disabled and senior citizens. That doubles the current mandatory sentence for the most 
violent sexual offenders. It also 
makes changes to the Jimmy Ryce Act, which allows the psychiatric review of sexually violent offend-ers after they ﬁ  nish their prison sentences. Those considered too dangerous are then committed to a high-security treatment center.
Lawmakers began looking at 
the Jimmy Ryce Act after Cher-ish’s death and a South Florida Sun Sentinel series that followed. The newspaper researched offend-ers who were re-
viewed for civil commitment but ended up being 
set free at some 
stage in the pro-cess. They found 594 offenders who commit-ted new crimes, 
some the day they were released, including 14 killings. The released prisoners also were later caught 
molesting 460 children and raping 
121 women, the newspaper found.
“Florida will not be a catch-and-
release state as it relates to violent sexual predators,” said Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Shalimar.
Cherish was abducted from a 
Jacksonville Wal-Mart, raped and strangled. Her body was found the 
next day.
Donald Smith is charged with 
murder in her killing. Smith had 
been reviewed twice before for civil commitment and allowed to remain free. He was released from jail the month before the kill-ing but wasn’t eligible for another 
review. Only offenders serving 
prison terms can be considered for commitment. Smith was in jail on misdemeanor charges after a plea deal in a case where he made ob-scene phone calls to a 10-year-old girl and impersonated a Florida Department of Children and Fami-lies child protective investigator to 
try to get access to her.
The statute of limitations will 
be eliminated for molesting chil-
dren younger than 16. Right now, molesters can’t be prosecuted if the crimes are reported more than three years later.
The most sexually dangerous 
offenders will also have to serve 
their entire sentences and not be al-
lowed a shorter sentence for good behavior.
Sexual abuse survivor Lauren Book took a break from a 1,500-mile sexual abuse awareness walk across Florida to attend the ceremony. Book has advocated 
for laws to increase penalties for 
sexual offenders, help victims and prevent abuse for 13 years, the ﬁ  rst as a 17-year-old still recovering from years of being raped by her nanny.
But she said she’s never seen a 
year where the Legislature has act-ed so quickly to address problems 
with sexual predators. 
“When we ﬁ  rst started talk-

STATERick Scott signs tougher sexual predator measures into law� STUDY SAYS SMALL BANKS 
CAN HELP SAVE MONEY.
MELISSA MIHM
Alligator Contributing Writer
A recent study shows that bank-
ing locally has the potential to save 
customers money.
Although many ﬂ  ock to the 
mega-banks such as Wells Fargo 
and Bank of America, a study by 
WalletHub recently suggested that choosing smaller, local banks could end up putting a few extra bucks in users’  pockets. 
John Kiernan, WalletHub’s se-
nior analyst, said consumers tend to go to larger banks because they are more familiar with the brands.
“You’re left at the mercy of what banks happen to be in your area,” he said, noting that the availability of free ATMs also plays a big role in 
the decision-making process.
For a standard savings account 
with a minimum balance of $50, 
VyStar Credit Union offers an annu-
al percentage yield — or how much an account appreciates over the year — of 0.25 percent. Wells Fargo’s standard APY is 0.03 percent, ac-cording to the study.
Major banks like Wells Fargo & 
Co. and Bank of America have rates that can vary up to 550 percent from city to city, according to the study.
However, these differences don’t 
mean much for college students who likely don’t even have four-digit amounts in their bank account, Kiernan said. 
John C. Banko, a UF ﬁ  nance lec-
turer, didn’t ﬁ  nd the study to be groundbreaking.
“Across the board, rates are as I 
expected — quite low, near zero,” he said.
Smaller banks may offer better 
rates to establish themselves in par-ticular areas, he said. Still, the rates 
will have little impact on someone’s 
checking account balance.  
“At the end of the year, you have 
earned about nothing in any case,” he said. “In economic terms, the dif-ferences are very small and quite meaningless.”Experts disagree about local banking

Underreported gradua-
tion rates could be an effect 
of student transfers.
According to a new study 
from the National Student Clearinghouse Research Cen-ter, about 13 percent of stu-
dents transfer from one col-
lege to another during their college education. As a re-sult, the colleges they trans-ferred from aren’t credited 
for their graduations, which 
can cause misleading gradu-ation rates. 
But UF spokeswoman Jan-
ine Sikes said this report does not have much impact on UF. She said different graduation rates are reported for incom-ing ﬁ  rst-time college students 
and for transfer students.   
“The impact of transfer 
students on our graduation 
rate is minimal, judging from 
our data on success rates. 
Our success rates are not that different from our regular rates,” Sikes said.
Graduation rates for ﬁ  rst-
time-in-college students are 
deﬁ  ned as the number of 
students who entered UF as freshmen and graduated as Gators. The numbers don’t include students who trans-
ferred out of UF. 
However, transfer stu-
dents are a part of the over-
all success rate, which is the number of students who enroll at UF at any point in their education and graduate 
from the university.
Students like Daniel Rob-
erts, a 21-year-old UF busi-
ness management junior 
and transfer student, count 
in UF’s success rate if they graduate. He said he waited to apply to UF until he had the grades he wanted. Now, 
he said, he appreciates the 
opportunities the transfer al-lowed. 
“I know that UF degrees 
hold a lot of value,” Roberts said.  Study: Transfers may 
affect calculated graduation rates

When Florida last faced UConn 
on Dec. 2, Kasey Hill watched from 
the end of the Gators’ bench.
At the time, the freshman point 
guard was nursing a high ankle 
sprain and could not help Florida 
as it fell to UConn 65-64 in Storrs, 
Conn., on a Shabazz Napier buzzer 
beater. 
UF played the final three min-
utes of the contest without a point 
guard because starter Scottie Wil-
bekin suffered his own ankle injury 
late in the game and did not return. 
But Saturday night will be a dif-
ferent story.  
Hill, who has excelled in the 
NCAA Tournament despite playing through turf toe, will be available for the No. 1 seed Gators when they square off against the seventh-seed-ed Huskies at 6:09 p.m. in AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.
“Kasey can definitely help us; 
it gives us more depth in the back-court,” coach Billy Donovan said.
“I think Kasey in the tourna-
ment, and even going back to the SEC has come on. He’s played bet-ter. He’s improved. I’ve got confi-dence in him. He makes our team faster when he’s out there.”Added Hill: “(I’ve been) just 
playing with more confidence, playing aggressive. Just trying to 
play my hardest for this team and 
give them all I got.”
In four tournament games, Hill has averaged 5.3 points per game and has totaled a team-high 15 as-sists against only four turnovers. 
But what the Umatilla native has 
done for Florida goes further than 
the stat sheet. The freshman has provided sol-
id minutes in the backcourt along-
side Wilbekin in a two-point guard 
lineup, utilizing his blazing speed 
to create offensive opportunities for 
him and his teammates.“Unless you have a guy like him 
in practice, you can’t really simu-
late that; we need him to get his 
speed into the game,” sophomore

Kevin O’Sullivan gave his team a 
warning following its sweep of then-No. 
8 LSU on Sunday: Don’t let up. There’s still baseball to be played next week.
The streaking No. 13 Florida Gators 
(19-10 6-3 Southeastern Conference), whether because of youth or fatigue, didn’t come ready to play against FAU (16-12, 4-8 Conference USA) on Tuesday night, and it cost them in a 5-4 loss in 11 innings. 
The Owls scored the go-ahead run on a first-and-third play with Aaron Rhodes pitching. Tyler Rocklein, 
the runner at first base, took off for sec-ond to get in a rundown and allow Cain 
Spangler to beat first baseman Braden 
Mattson’s throw home.
Rhodes hesitated before throwing to 
second baseman Casey Turgeon, whose toss back to Mattson took the first base-man’s momentum away from home plate, forcing his throw home into the Florida falls to FAU in extrasSoftbAll

After winning 22 straight games to start 
the season and outscoring opponents 181-
29 in those matchups, Florida has hit a 
slump.
Since Southeastern Conference play 
began, the Gators have dropped seven of 
their past 16 contests and dropped all three 
games in a series sweep to No. 2 Tennessee 
this past weekend.
Outside of leadoff hitter Kelsey Stew-
art, whose .412 batting average is the ninth highest in the SEC, there is little consistency among the Gators’ bats.
“Obviously, we’re go-
ing through a point in time 
in the season where we’re 
not playing our best,” coach Tim Walton said in 
a release following Flori-da’s 9-2 loss to Tennessee 
on Friday. “But there is a 
lot of the season left.”
But No. 6 UF (31-7, 5-7 SEC) hopes to 
spearhead its way back into the win col-umn when it faces No. 8 FSU (34-4, 12-2 
Atlantic Coast Conference) in a midweek UF hitters slumping in SEC

Alligator Writer @GordonStreisand
This season, a small, quick, of-
fensive-minded Florida team made 
its way to the second round of the NCAA Tournament despite having only eight players for much of the 
way. 
Its leaders were redshirt senior 
Lily Svete and senior Jaterra Bonds, 
but redshirt junior Kayla Lewis also had a strong presence throughout the season. 
“I brag a lot about Lily and Ja-
terra,” coach Amanda Butler said. “They deserve that, but Kayla was 
a big, big part of that leadership 
corps.
“I think there were many things, 
most of them falling in the intangi-ble category, that separated us from who we’ve been in the past or from other teams.”
Lewis will be Florida’s lone se-
nior next season, and the road to be-
coming a strong team leader has not 
been sudden.
“I think that was something that 
she grew into,” Butler said. “I’ve had very high expectations for her entire career. 
“Kayla’s wildly talented, very 
smart, very gifted. It’s a unique challenge when you’re the only se-nior, and I think Kayla’s a unique individual. She’s well-suited for that 
challenge.”
Butler isn’t the only one giving Lewis a vote of confidence. 
After living with Lewis for her 
entire career as a Gator, there isn’t anyone else Bonds has more confi-
dence in to take the keys. “I would say, this year, Kayla’s 
probably the most improved play-er,” Bonds said. “I’ve seen a differ-
ent side of Kayla that I’ve never seen 
since we first stepped on campus. I told her, ‘I’m just so proud of you and happy for the things that you’re doing, like become a better person and get closer with God.’
“I’m just so proud of her and how 
she’s accepted the role of having to play a bigger role for our team.”
Another player whose role will 
be further increased is soon-to-be redshirt junior point guard Cassie Peoples. 
After struggling offensively 
throughout the regular season, Peoples found her stride once post-season play began in both the South-eastern Conference and NCAA 
Tournaments. 
“Really, Cassie was a freshman,” 
Butler said. 
“Even though she’s in her third 
year of college, this was the first full 
season of basketball she had gotten a chance to play.”
In conference play, Peoples av-
eraged 8.9 points per contest. In 
postseason play, she was scoring 14 
points a game. 
“This is a great starting point for her going into next year,” Butler said. “She’s going to be someone that we won’t be necessarily surprised by, 
but relying on her.”
The impact of Bonds and Svete’s 
departure will surely be felt. How-
ever, the incoming freshman class will add much needed size and depth. 
According to espnW, the Gators 
have the No. 12 recruiting class in 
2014. The potential gem of the class 
is 6-foot-3 forward Haley Lorenzen, who is rated as the No. 5 post player in the nation.
 “The obvious thing Haley adds 
is a great deal of size,” Butler said. “What she adds that you don’t know about until you get the oppor-tunity to spend time with her is her 
personality and her work ethic; the 
spirit that she has. 
“She has a high level of skill and 
she cares a lot about her game.”14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, APRIL 2, 2014

For Bridget Sloan and the rest of the Flor-
ida gymnasts, the time for individual goals 
is over. 
“I just want the best for this team right 
now,” Sloan said. “I guess regular season you can have those individual titles and stuff, but when it comes to postseason, man, 
it’s all about the team. I always say no one 
is really going to remember that I won all-around in 2013, but I will guarantee they will know which team won.”
No one has forgotten that Florida claimed 
its first NCAA Championship last year. With only one meet standing between the Gators and the 2014 Championship meet, Florida is focusing in on repeating that success. 
“Some teams get a little bit ahead of 
themselves, they start looking past each completion and just look at the end,” Sloan said. “Well there are steps that you have to go through and we learned last year that if 
you do those steps correctly and in the right 
order, you can be very successful.” 
The Gators are gearing up to step back 
onto the floor after having their first week-
end off since the start of the season in Janu-
ary. 
“This team, you know they really have 
started to sharpen up because we gave those few days of kind of taking it down a little bit 
after SECs and now it’s the build up,” coach 
Rhonda Faehn said. 
With the first of three postseason appear-
ances out of the way, Sloan said the team is 
transitioning into the necessary mindset. 
“Rhonda always emphasizes for postsea-
son: It’s really not about whether you’re go-
ing to make the routine or not because we know we’re going to make it,” she said. “It’s 
going to be about whether you want it, how bad you want it and how well you’re going 
to do it.”
Sloan said the week of straight practice 
was more about skills and details on vault 
and bars than full routines.
“Those were two events 
that we were so strong on 
last year, but this year it’s like we’re taking a little ex-
tra time getting in the swing of things on bars,” Sloan said. “We’re missing the landings on vault a little bit 
here and there. So we’ve re-
ally been focusing on just the littlest details. 
… They make the biggest difference.” 
Faehn maintained that her team doesn’t 
really feel it has a target on its back, even with a No. 1 ranking heading into Region-als.
“Really use it again as a launching pad as 
a preparation to feel 100 percent secure with 
our lineups,” Faehn said. “I feel like right 
now the lineups are going to be identical if not extremely similar as we had at SECs.” 
The Gators will be the only top-10 team 
competing when Penn State hosts the NCAA Regionals on Saturday. No. 12 Oregon State, No. 15 Penn State, No. 23 New Hampshire, No. 29 Kentucky and No. 36 Maryland will all be competing with Florida for a top-two 
finish at Regionals. The top-two teams from 
each of the six regional sites move onto the NCAA Championship in Birmingham, Ala., from April 18-20. 
“Because there’s a greater variety of 
schools that we haven’t seen all year long I think it’s a wonderful atmosphere,” Faehn 
said. “Our team, I know their sole focus is 
to go in there and compete aggressively and have a lot of energy and to kind of make that our own home environment.” Sloan, Gators focusing on team

UF coachshooting guard Michael Frazier II said. 
“When he gets into the game, just rise the temperature of the game.”
Hill’s best game in Memphis, Tenn.,  
came against the Bruins on Thursday. 
He shined in UF’s 79-68 win over 
UCLA in the Sweet 16, racking up a game-high 10 assists, six points and six rebounds.
“I thought what he did in the UCLA 
game really helped us,” Donovan said. “He manufactured a lot of easy baskets for us by getting down the lane.”
The freshman point guard has also 
made strides defensively throughout the tournament, recording five steals, a block and 10 defensive rebounds. 
“On the defensive side, definitely feel 
more comfortable there,” Hill said. “Get-
ting out and making plays on the de-
fensive end and stuff like that. I wasn’t really doing that at the beginning of the season.”
Hill’s turf toe has caused him some 
discomfort during Florida’s tournament run, but he said he should be fine moving forward. 
Donovan shared the same sentiment 
Monday. 
“I know turf toe is painful, but come 
on, we’re playing in the Final Four,” Don-ovan said. 
“He’ll be fine. He’s a great kid. Hope-
fully his toe will be OK and he’ll be able to play.   But I do appreciate him working 
through that. He doesn’t appear to be in a lot of pain when he’s running around out there. He’s moving pretty well.”
dirt. 
It’s a play the Gators practice all 
the time and a play that they’ve been 
drilled on since high school. 
That sequence summed up a 
head-scratching loss where the Gators scored only one run after the first inning.
“I’m dissapointed with our ap-
proach tonight to be honest with you. I’m really disappointed,” O’Sullivan said. 
“I would expect our guys to be 
ready to play all the time. I think they should be excited. 
“We’re coming off winning 13 of 
16. We come off a great weekend, a great week last week, and I didn’t 
think we were ready to play. We 
tried. We cheerleaded during the game, but there’s only so much you can do, and that falls on my shoul-ders. I’ll take responsibility for it, but I’ll make sure it doesn’t happen again.”
Karsten Whitson, the former 
ninth-overall pick, made his first start since March 9 and tossed two innings against the Owls. Whitson threw 25 of his 40 pitches for strikes. 
The Owls drove in its only run 
against him on a groundball to short-stop Richie Martin in the second in-ning. O’Sullivan visited Whitson on 
the mound in the second follow-
ing an infield hit to Ricky Santiago. Whitson threw two straight balls to his next batter, Billy Endris, before striking out Endris on three-straight pitches. 
Florida pitchers saw their share 
of success against FAU, striking out a season-high 19 batters, but the of-
fense continuously struggled.
The Gators plated three first in-
ning runs on a sacrifice fly by Taylor 
Gushue, a throwing error on an in-field single by Mattson and a ground ball to shortstop from Justin Shafer. Freshman John Sternagel drove in his fourth RBI in two games with a 
sacrifice fly to left field in the sixth.
Sternagel admitted after his two-
RBI performance against Florida 
State on March 25 that he hasn’t played as much as he thought in his freshman season. 
Dating back to that game, he’s bat-
ting .313 with six RBIs and has start-ed every game at third base where 
he has just one error this year.
“He’s putting some good swings 
on the ball,” O’Sullivan said. 
“It lengthens our lineup a little bit 
and gives us a chance to score when 
we get to the bottom half of the or-der.”
FAU responded in the inning 
following every run-scoring frame from UF.
Owls designated hitter Esteban 
Puerta went 4 for 5 at the plate with his hits coming off of four different Gators pitchers.

alligatorSports.org.matchup tonight at 6 at Katie Seashole 
Pressly Stadium.
The Gators boast an 18-13 all-time re-
cord against the Seminoles, including a 
9-6 mark at home. Florida swept the se-
ries in 2013, winning 7-3 in Gainesville 
after a walk-off grand slam by Briana Little and an 8-0 win in Tallahassee three weeks later.
FSU is riding a 13-game win streak 
heading into tonight’s matchup. If UF wants to pull out the win, it needs to find a way to get around FSU’s dominant pitching staff.
As a team, the Seminoles possess a 0.90 ERA — the second-best total in the country. Junior Lacey Waldrup leads Florida State in the circle. The right-hander is second in the nation with a 0.53 
ERA. In 145.1 innings pitched, Waldrup 
has notched 178 strikeouts and is hold-ing opponents to a .154 clip at the plate.
The Seminoles are also seeing success 
at the plate with Maddie O’Brien pacing FSU. 
The junior shortstop holds a team-
best .438 batting average and also leads Florida State with a .893 slugging per-
centage, 13 home runs and 58 RBIs. In 
112 at-bats, O’Brien struck out just 10 times this season.
If Florida wants to win tonight, it will need to continue to see strides at the plate from players like Kirsti Merritt.
The sophomore center fielder logged 
three home runs against Tennessee, 
matching her home run total from the 
first 35 games of the season.
While Merritt has started to find her 
stride, Walton hopes to see improve-
ment from his team that batted just .208 
and struck out 27 times in three games against the Volunteers, especially be-cause less than one-third of the regular season remains to be played.
“The bottom line is we have to ex-
ecute,” Walton said. “That’s going to be the key. We have to execute every-thing.”

� JUNIOR WON THE LONG JUMP IN 
AUSTIN, TEXAS.
LAWRENCE LAGUNA
Alligator Writer @LagunaLawrence
Marquis Dendy is on his way to recover-
ing from the NCAA Indoor Championships.
After failing to score at the national meet 
last month, Dendy took ﬁ  rst place in the long 
jump at the Clyde Littleﬁ  eld Texas Relays in 
Austin, Texas, after jumping 7.93 meters on 
Friday.
The mark isn’t his career best, but it 
showed coach Mike Holloway that his long jumper is back to the standard Dendy sets for himself.
Holloway said Dendy’s pride hurt him 
when trying to come back from a torn labrum and dislocated arm. 
But the junior is realizing that now, and he 
is taking a different direction in order to be a champion again.  
“He’s a lot more focused, he’s working a 
lot harder and he understands that he has the ability to get back to where he was,” Hollo-way said. 
“He had surgery this fall and I think some-
times when you’re young and you’re a great 
athlete, you think you can step back on the track and it’s just going to happen and that’s 
not the way it works.”
Dendy’s results in the long jump and triple 
jump have been a roller coaster ride because of his surgery in September. But he has slowly made his way back to top ﬁ  nishes. 
During the indoor season, he ﬁ  nished 11th 
at the Southeastern Conference Champion-ship in the triple jump. 
He just missed the podium in his other 
event, placing fourth in the long jump during the same competition.
Similarly, Dendy placed 16th in the long 
jump at NCAA Indoors and didn’t qualify for a triple-jump ﬁ  nal.
But after overcoming the adversity from 
his torn labrum and surgery, the Middleton, Del., native is hoping to build on his win at the Texas Relays.
The signiﬁ  cance of placing high at a meet 
like the Texas Relays gives Dendy more of an upper hand because the level of competition is what the Gators will see at outdoor nation-als. 
“It prepares us for the future, it prepares 
us for things we have to get done down the road,” Holloway said. “The signiﬁ  cance is we get to go to a meet that is a championship cali-ber race with championship caliber athletes.”
Understanding what it takes to overcome 
defeat is an attribute every athlete must come to comprehend. Dendy said he leaves every-thing in the past in order to prove himself all over again. 
“I know how to keep my progression go-
ing,” Dendy said. “I don’t shy from any type of expectations, I don’t say I can’t do this. Can’t is not in my vocabulary.”Dendy re-emerges after poor performance at Indoors
