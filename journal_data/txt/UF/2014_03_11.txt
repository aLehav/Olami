In a crowd of leather, 
bandanas and arm tattoos, an 
8-year-old got to do what he’s 
always wanted: burn rubber with the big shots.
Marc Okes, like many 
boys, loves motorcycles and policemen, but unlike the average ﬁ  rst-grader, he suffers from a cancerous brain 
tumor.
His dream has been to ride 
a motorcycle, and on Monday afternoon with the help of 
local police departments and 
Gainesville Harley Davidson, 
that dream became a reality.
When Marc told his mom, 
Sandi Okes, and family friend 
Christy Anderson that he 
wanted to ride in a motorcycle parade, Anderson quickly coordinated the ride with a fellow motorcyclist and 
a retired Gainesville Police 
sergeant.
Beginning the parade at 
Gainesville Harley Davidson, 
supporters lined the roads to 
cheer Marc on as nearly 200 VOLUME 108 ISSUE 112 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG TUESDAY, MARCH 11, 2014

Sigma Alpha Epsilon, a national fra-
ternity that has fallen under scrutiny for 
its multiple hazing-related deaths, elimi-nated its pledging process Sunday. UF’s chapter is still deciding its stance on the 
national branch’s decision.
“We’re still formulating our opinion 
on national’s decision and really don’t 
have anything to say at this time,” said Tyler Conte, the president of UF’s SAE chapter and a 21-year-old astronomy and economics junior.
The national fraternity will adopt 
a quicker acceptance process in which 
potential members must reply to a bid 
within 96 hours. Along with the short-ened acceptance period, pledge-educa-tion programs will be replaced with pro-grams for all members. The new system will go into effect during Fall 2014.
Brandon Weghorst, a spokesman for 
SAE’s national branch, said the change is a move back toward the fraternity’s 
founding: Prior to World War I, candi-
dates became full members as soon as they were accepted.
At least 10 deaths from SAE-related 
activities have occurred since 2006, Bloomberg reported. The change in the fraternity’s acceptance process aims to curb this number, but SAE isn’t the ﬁ  rst fraternity to try the change. Zeta Beta 
Tau abolished pledging in 1989.

About 26 Democratic senators, including 
Florida Senator Bill Nelson, and two inde-
pendents pulled an all-nighter Monday in the Capitol to discuss climate change.
The talkathon was held by the recently 
launched Senate Climate Action Task Force.  The task force, organized by California Sena-tor Barbara Boxer and Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, was started to “wake up Congress” to issues surrounding climate 
change.
According to C-SPAN, the all-night session 
was the 35th of its kind in the history of the 
Senate. Senators could tweet throughout the night using the hashtag #Up4Climate.
Nelson wrote in an email that Florida needs to be concerned with climate change.
“With over 1,300 miles of coastline and 
most residents living near the water even a 
1 - 2 foot rise, in the opinion of some experts, 
would have a disastrous effect on the state,” he wrote.
Unlike a ﬁ  libuster, there was no legislation 
up for debate during the talkathon.
Carolyn Cox, coordinator at the Florida Climate Institute at UF, said although she was happy to see Nelson attending, she is not sure how much of an impact the talkathon will 
have.
“It’s going to take more than a night,” she 
said. “It’s good to see senators that are taking a 
stand now. It’s a positive step to getting some-thing done.” US Senators — including Bill Nelson — up all night to talk climateSEE MARC, PAGE 3

Spectators cheered as a mile of motorcycles paraded through the county
motorcycles escorted him to High Springs 
and back.
Marc rode in the sidecar of Gainesville 
Harley Davidson owner and general manager Kevin Lytle’s motorcycle while his mom rode on the back.
Marc’s favorite motorcycle in the parade was “the black one,” he said, but 
he pointed excitedly at all the motorcycles 
and repeatedly shouted, “Mommy, look at that one!”
“It was my favorite day because I never 
done that in my whole entire life,” Marc said after the parade.  
Lytle said Anderson reached out to 
him with the idea to help Marc. He said it started out as a small ride until it hit social 
media.
“A little bit of the word got out to some 
people, and this is what you see today,” 
he said as he gestured to the crowd with 
a smile.
Rick Buehn, a motorcyclist and one of 
the organizers, rode near the front of the 
parade in his motorcycle. 
He said the support for Marc was huge.
“There were a bunch of people lining the 
route, and they were just waving,” he said. 
“It could not have been a more beautiful day for a better cause.”
Ofﬁ  cers from GPD, Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce, University Police and Alachua Police Department participated in the parade.
Marc received presents from some of 
the agencies. 
GPD gifted him with a motorcycle helmet 
designed to match the ofﬁ  cers. Lytle gave him a motorcycle number plate signed by 
Gainesville Harley Davidson employees, 
and the sheriff’s ofﬁ  ce presented him with a plaque and hat naming him an honorary member of the motor department.
Retired GPD Sgt. John Franklin also 
helped organize the event. 
He said he rode toward the back, so he 
could watch as almost a mile of motorcycles drove Marc around the county.
“You get choked up,” he said. “Hell, 
I was crying through half of the route. I think he had a great time, and it was an honor, an absolute honor, and something 
that’s pretty important to him. Kids should 
not have to go through this.”  
Marc’s mom, Sandi, said he was so 
excited when they arrived he almost jumped out of the car before she parked.
Because Marc is sick, he doesn’t get to 
do a lot of the fun things he wants to, she said. 
She was thrilled when the parade turned 
out to be so big.
“You want to see happy days for him that 
he’s going to remember forever, and that’s 
what this was for,” she said. “Through all 
of this Marc is the most positive.”
When the parade ﬁ  nished and the 
line of motorcycles returned to the store, Marc took off his GPD helmet and blue 
sunglasses and hopped out of his sidecar. 
He plopped his ASO hat on his mother’s 
head and gave a thumbs up to the crowd, 
which shouted “Way to go, Marc!” and 
“One more time!”
Marc gave Lytle a long hug to thank 
him. 
Then he pulled back.
“Wanna take me for a ride on the red 
one now?”MARC , from page 1

motorcycle parade leaderrushed ZBT his sophomore year.
Hudson said ZBT’s lack of pledging has removed haz-
ing from the equation while increasing the number of ap-
plicants for the fraternity.
“When you haze, I feel like you scar kids,” he said. “We 
use this in place of hazing: We educate our brothers.”
Sigma Phi Epsilon also nationally banned pledging in 
1991, but its UF chapter closed in January 2013 for multiple breaches of the university’s policies — including hazing.
UF’s SAE chapter isn’t exempt from the fraternity’s 
national reputation. According to UF’s Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution website, the chapter was put on probation until January 2015 with academic sanctions for hazing in Fall 2010.
Santiago Ramirez, the public relations director for UF’s 
Interfraternity Council, declined to comment. Several SAE brothers also declined to comment.
Jack Causseaux, the associate director of Sorority and 
Fraternity Affairs at UF, wrote in an email interview he trusts SAE’s national leadership to make the best decision for the fraternity.
“I think the fraternity’s decision to improve their mem-
ber education programs can positively affect other frater-nities and sororities on campus,” he said.
However, some fraternity members feel the pledging 
process is integral to making sure each new member is a snug fit.
Fred Kolb, a Sigma Nu brother and director of edu-
cation programming for IFC, said SAE’s removal of the pledging process is a big step. 
“I think that’s a disservice to the new people and the 
old brothers,” said Kolb, a 21-year-old UF economics and 
political science junior. 
He said there are other methods of reducing hazing, 
such as raising awareness. 
Weghorst said the decision wasn’t a result of a particu-
lar event, but the fraternity’s Supreme Council is looking 
to improve the experience for brothers.
“We’ve had a number of incidents over the years that 
are regrettable,” he said. “Our goal is to provide the best and safest experience that we possibly can.”
He said the pledging process is a flawed system, and 
chapters worried about the 96 hours being too short to effectively choose members should be more selective in their search.
“Chapters should be making friends and evaluating 
people year round,” he said. “It’s not going to solve all of our problems, but it’s definitely more aligned with what this organization is all about.”LAUREN ZIKA

Gainesville’s last Quiznos will 
be closing its doors Saturday.
The store, located at 3545 SW 
34th St., has been open for 10 
years. 
Lance O’Carroll, who has 
owned the store for the last four 
years, said he decided to retire 
after seeing a gradual decrease in sales.
He said he thought about sell-
ing the business, but the landlord 
has other plans for the space once 
the lease is up.
“My relationship with the peo-
ple is what I’ll miss the most,” he 
said.
He has been telling customers 
the news as they come in and said 
he has seen how much the store will be missed.
“There are a lot of addicted 
Quiznos fans,” he said. “Every-one is really sad.”
UF used to house a Quiznos in 
the Hub, but it was replaced with a Provisions on Demand Market in November 2012.
Nazanin Yazdi, a 26-year-old 
UF interior architecture junior, has worked at Quiznos for the past two years.
For Yazdi, Quiznos was never 
just work. 
It was a source of good times 
and conversation with co-work-ers and customers.
Yazdi expects the store’s last 
day to be an emotional one.
“I will miss working with 
Lance and seeing the regular cus-tomers,” she said.
Joey Martinez, a 29-year-old 
UF public relations junior, said he was disappointed to hear the store is closing.
Although he had not been to 
that location, he frequented a  
Quiznos in Jacksonville.
“I used to go there on my 
lunch breaks when I worked in 
Jacksonville,” Martinez said. “I 
really enjoyed it.”
He said he plans to visit the 
Gainesville store before it closes 
Saturday. 4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MARCH 11, 2014

TAMPA — An autopsy report released Monday says a 
man who killed four people and himself while driving the 
wrong way on a Florida highway had more than twice the 
state’s legal limit of alcohol in his system.
The Hillsborough County medical examiner’s office re-
leased the report on 28-year-old Daniel Morris of Tampa.
The crash happened on Interstate 275 in Tampa about 
2 a.m. Feb. 9. 
Morris’ SUV was going the wrong way and hit a Hyun-
dai Sonata carrying four University of South Florida mem-
bers of the fraternity Sigma Beta Rho.
According to investigators, Morris climbed into his 
roommate’s SUV on the night of Feb. 8 and sped away from a party in East Tampa. Where he got onto the inter-state heading south in the northbound lanes is unclear.
The autopsy report showed that Morris had a blood al-
cohol level of 0.20 percent. State law considers a driver 
impaired at 0.08.
The report also said Morris had traces of marijuana in 
his system.
The Florida Highway Patrol said it is still investigating 
the crash and is trying to figure out where Morris improp-erly entered the interstate or began to travel in the wrong 
direction.
Authorities identified the fraternity brothers as Jobin 
Joy Kuriakose, 21, Ankeet Harshad Patel, 22, Imtiyaz

PLEDGE , from page 1Republican senators not listed to speak
The institute reached out to Nelson on social media 
offering him its expertise for his talk.
At the talk, Nelson said he will be meeting with a 
commerce committee in April to have a hearing on how 
climate change is affecting Florida.
“Florida is ground zero for sea-level rise,” he said 
Monday.
Alix Kermes, a 20-year-old UF sustainability studies 
junior, said it’s important to have a Florida senator who took part in the talkathon.
“Florida will be greatly affected by the climate 
change,” she said. “Our water usage will depend on climate change.”
Republican senators were not listed to speak at the 
event.UF biology professor Ted Schuur said participation 
from both parties will be needed to get any effective climate change legislation passed.
“Climate change is not a partisan issue,” he said. 
“The climate continues to change, and it’s not something we want to let slip to the back of our minds.”
Last June, President Obama un-
veiled his plan to fight climate change. The plan included actions to combat carbon pollution and prepare for cli-mate change effects.
Alex Ahrenholz, a 21-year-old 
UF sustainability and the built envi-
ronment junior, said more needs to be done to handle climate change, and the talkathon was a good way to start.
“Hopefully it gets the conversation going,” he said.CLIMATE , from page 1

� UF WAS NAMED THE THIRD-BEST 
VALUE IN BIG COLLEGES NATIONWIDE.
MEGAN KELLY and ALEXIA MARCHETTI
Alligator Contributing Writers
UF was recently ranked again as a top-val-
ue and top-academic university nationwide.
Kiplinger’s Personal Finance Magazine 
named UF the third-best value in large col-
leges nationwide, as well as in the southeast. 
UF is the largest college ranked in the top 10 
universities.
The rankings are based on academic qual-
ity and affordability, low student-faculty ra-tios, high graduation rates, reasonable price tags and financial aid, according to Kiplinger’s website.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said he 
thinks the student-loan debt criteria of the 
ranking stands out the most.
“Consider that two-thirds of UF students graduate with no student-loan debt,” he said. 
“Nationally, it’s just the opposite.”
The average UF student carries about 
$20,700 in student-loan debt, and the national average is more than $29,000, he said.
Eliza Barrocas, a 19-year-old UF family, 
youth and community sciences sophomore, said she agreed that UF gives students the best education for their dollar.
“It’s nice to know that you are getting your 
money’s worth and that my degree will hold some weight when I graduate,” she said.
In addition to being recognized for value, 
UF was also ranked “Most Academic” in Col-legeAtlas.org’s rankings of more than 1,300 
U.S. colleges and universities.
The list is based on three factors: affordabil-
ity, academic quality and accessibility.
CollegeAtlas.org created two lists detailing 
the top 100 schools based on both in-state and 
out-of-state tuition, said Branden Neish, the general manger of CollegeAtlas.org and cre-ator of the list.On the in-state tuition list, UF was ranked 
No. 96. UF was not ranked on the out-of-state tuition list.
Looking at the two lists, CollegeAtlas.org 
gave awards to the top schools in each list that are the best at one single attribute in February. 
For the top 10 most academic schools from the 
in-state tuition list, UF ranked No. 1.
It used U.S. News & World Report’s Best 
College Rankings to assess the academic standing of each institution.
“We wanted to create a list that is actually 
relevant and applicable for most students,” Neish said.
The three factors of affordability, accessibil-
ity and academics are important to Elizabeth DiVito, a 19-year-old UF international studies and political science sophomore.
“I ultimately chose to go to UF after I was 
admitted because of its notable academic rep-utation,” DiVito said. “As great as it was to get in though, I never would’ve been able to go if it wasn’t affordable.”UF tops the charts in something other than basketball

A prescribed burn is a fire 
set by rangers in order to re-store the native habitat, said parks service specialist Amber Roux. 
“(Paynes Prairie) is a fire-
dependent ecosystem,” Roux said. “We still need to have fire in these systems to keep them healthy and functional.”
Experts control the fires by 
keeping them within strict pa-rameters that are a safe distance away from U.S. Route 441, said assistant park manager Matt Bledsoe. 
“We work very closely with 
Florida Highway (Patrol),” he said. “We would not do a burn if it was projected to affect the highway.”
Rangers will not conduct a 
real prescribed fire during Fire Fest because burns are depen-dent on the weather, he said.
At the event, participants 
will visit various interactive stations to learn about the tools and equipment used to conduct burns. There will also be scav-enger hunts, hayrides and an appearance by Smokey Bear. 
Shelby Krantz, a 22-year-old 
UF forest resources and conser-
vation second-year graduate 
student, said she would be in-terested in attending.
“It’s important for people 
to know why (the prairie) is on fire, and why it’s OK for the people to do it,” she said.Paynes Prairie heats

BEIJING — The anguished hours 
had turned into a day and a half. Fed 
up with awaiting word on the miss-ing Malaysia Airlines plane, rela-tives of passengers in Beijing lashed 
out at the carrier with a handwritten 
ultimatum and an impromptu news conference.
Faced with an emergency, the 
airline said it was doing all it could to answer questions about Flight MH370, which disappeared from radar Saturday with 239 people aboard while heading from Kuala 
Lumpur to Beijing. The uncertainty 
over the plane’s whereabouts was frustrating relatives but also hinder-ing the carrier’s ability to respond: It’s difficult to deliver a clear mes-sage with so much still unclear.
From a room set aside at a hotel 
near the Beijing airport, a man with a black shirt emerged with a state-ment signed by about 100 of the rel-atives saying that unless the carrier could give them some clarity, they would take their complaints to the Malaysian Embassy.
“We don’t believe Malaysia Air-
lines anymore. Sorry everyone, we 
just don’t believe them anymore,” 
the man, who refused to give his name, told reporters Sunday.
By this time, the airline already 
dispatched dozens of caregivers to Beijing, assigned one to each fam-ily and provided accommodation, food, transport and financial assis-
tance. It said it was providing regu-lar updates despite a lack of infor-
mation about the plane.
But the initial disorder of Malay-
sia Airlines’ response, and its lack of official contact with relatives in the early-going, set the tone for the en-suing hours of waiting.
“One of the most important 
things to remember here,” said Frank Taylor, a former director of an aviation safety center at Cran-field University in Britain, “is that it’s much easier to stand down staff 
after an initial over-reaction than to 
play catch-up after an initial under-reaction.”
The relatives had expected the 
plane’s arrival at 6:30 a.m. Satur-day. About four hours later, a hand-written note was posted on a white board in the arrival hall advising relatives to use a shuttle service to go to the Lido Hotel to await infor-
mation.
But when the family members 
got there, they wandered around 
lost and distressed before hotel staff — apparently unprepared — escort-ed them into a private area. It was several hours before a spokesman made a brief statement to reporters.
“We’re literally trying to find out what happened, and until you actu-ally find the aircraft, you have no 
way of knowing what actually went 
on there,” the airline’s commercial director, Hugh Dunleavy, told the Associated Press on Sunday. “Our main focus has been to come here, meet the families, give them as much information as we can but without raising false hopes.”
Still, relatives complained that 
the airline hasn’t been forthcom-
ing with information. Instead of 
hearing from the carrier, they said, they’ve had to rely on news reports for updates on the search.
By later Sunday, the airline was 
trying to speak more regularly with relatives and expedite passport and visa applications for those who 
wanted to go to Malaysia.

Dear fellow male UF students:
The Facebook post created two 
weeks ago by one UF student adver-
tising a sublet amid some misogynistic tan-gents quickly garnered more than a thousand likes and was quickly picked up by BuzzFeed. The poster began by expressing frustration on the displacement of “facey hoes” from the third ﬂ  oor of Library West and end-ed by plugging the room he’s subleasing with, “You can practically smell the punany when you walk outside.” 
In our present environment, it’s tempting to dismiss 
the absurd post as either satire or a subleasing ad gone horribly wrong. And although I agree an isolated idiot is best left isolated, it’s also clear that such sexist language is simply a more explicit manifestation of our gender’s col-lective mindset. As males, although we might’ve never heard of “facey hoes” before, let’s not kid ourselves: We’re all familiar with the other not-so-politically correct terms used daily to describe women.
Let me share something rather interesting. Out of the 
estimated 17,600 female undergraduate students at UF, 4,400 of them have been or will be sexually assaulted be-fore they graduate, according to one estimate. Our cam-pus has been the subject of past media scrutiny as we have fallen prey to the well-known relationship between Greek life and rape culture.
As a male, I know how instinctively defensive we get 
when hearing about rape, as if it’s somehow our fault that rapists are on the loose. But, my fellow men, this is the problem. Sexual assaults don’t come from some “stranger jumping out of the bushes,” as our assistant dean of stu-dents aptly noted. Men, including you and I, are primarily responsible for the systematic degradation of women. When you ponder the fact that another 
female student will probably be sexually as-
saulted before my next column is published, 
remember that such violence didn’t appear 
overnight. 
For years, we’ve ridiculed “stingy hoes” 
for being so reluctant to our sexual advances. 
And what about those “bitches” who’ve ren-dered the process of “getting laid” so compli-cated? After all, what’s the worth of a “pussy” 
if not to serve our masculine tastes?
Today’s situation comes after years of male privilege, 
whereby we, males, cleverly elude all our blame. It began when female students were told to take Rape Aggression Defense classes at Preview, as if rape is just another fact of life and women need to protect themselves from this inev-itable annoyance. We fueled the ﬂ  ames of degradation by becoming desensitized — after all, what can be expected from a group that routinely refers to women as “chicks”? And it culminates with women, including many sorority members, being ashamed to speak up after being abused at the risk of being called a male-basher. Oh! How effec-tive our oppression has been.
I’m aware that epithets aren’t the actual disease. Rath-
er, they serve as symptoms. Just like the wide and casual usage of racist slurs reﬂ  ected the white supremacy of the era, so too, is our daily usage of “bitch” and “hoe” reﬂ  ec-tive of our male supremacy.
In today’s America, we expect that if a racist comment 
was jokingly thrown around in a room full of only white folks, more than one white person would immediately step up to the moral plate and bat away such ignorance. But the same can’t be said about women. As men, when’s the last time one of us repudiated a sexist remark when it was just “us” guys chilling?

Get informed on 
Gville government
The ‘I Voted’ stickers have long been collected, Turlington 
is no longer a ﬂ  ier danger zone, and Swamp Party shirts only make appearances at the gym. You probably thought 
election season was over. Think again: Student Government politics may be paused for now, but the city’s are just heating 
up.
The City of Gainesville elections are today. Residents will 
select three commissioners for three-year terms.
Although the majority of UF students aren’t likely registered 
to vote in these elections, they — you — should be paying atten-
tion to the platforms and results.
In general, the commission oversees areas such as transpor-
tation, public safety and recreation. That means it makes deci-sions concerning RTS buses, the homeless population, noise 
ordinances, the farmers market, gameday parking, Butler Plaza 
and more.
Under its purview are events like the Hoggetowne Medieval 
Festival. It oversees city parks, as well.
The commission also holds the keys to city utilities rates. 
Each summer, the commission holds a series of budget work-shops that set the utility bill rate for the upcoming year. That means candidates elected during this cycle can be instrumen-tal in either raising or lowering the already sky-high utilities 
prices.
Although it’s students’ responsibility as temporary 
Gainesville residents to stay informed about city politics — be-
cause those politics directly affect students’ lives and, more im-portantly, their money — it’s also the responsibility of commis-sioners to connect with students. Gainesville, like other college towns, faces a unique problem: How does a local government stay in touch with a population that is constantly in ﬂ  ux?
After all, UF and Santa Fe College students account for a sig-
niﬁ  cant portion of the local population and stimulate the city’s economy. Their needs should be taken into account when it comes to policymaking and major budget decisions.
It’s also up to candidates to reach out to students. The edito-
rial board was surprised that none of the District 2 At-Large, District 2 or District 3 candidates reached out to the Alligator with letters to the editor, as is common during Student Gov-ernment elections. It’s important that local government incum-bents and hopefuls do not discount the student vote because 
the scope of city government encompasses areas that impact 
student life.
But students need to pay attention to politics. Vote in today’s 
election if you remembered to register; even if you didn’t, look up the candidates’ backgrounds and ideas. Go to the commis-sion meetings, held every second Thursday, to let your voice be heard. Get — and stay — informed.
Follow along tonight as we live-tweet the results when polls 
close at @theAlligator (we’ll be using #gnvpol).
Although students may be part of this community for a 
shorter time than other, more permanent residents, remember this is your city as much as anyone else’s. Own it by under-standing it.

I was eavesdropping in 
the hair salon the other day because, really, what 
else am I going to do when I can’t move my head, leave 
my chair or watch videos on 
my phone without feeling self-conscious?
So I listened and watched 
in astonishment through the reﬂ  ection of the station’s mirror as a hairdresser asked a lady if she was pregnant. My stomach lurched as I waited for her answer, silently hop-
ing, “Please let her be; please let her be.”
But my stomach fell when her answer 
was, in fact, “No.” I thought asking a 
woman when she is due was a common social faux pas brought up enough in the media and movies that people knew bet-ter than to ask, but apparently not.
I felt so bad for that woman in the sa-
lon because even if she didn’t show that 
she was fazed, her feelings may have 
been hurt, and her day may have been ruined. Even if you are 99-percent cer-tain a woman is expecting, it is not worth the 1 percent of uncertainty to risk hurt-ing her self-esteem.
This brief social observation made me 
think of other questions people often ask that they shouldn’t.
1. Are you pregnant? When are you 
due? Are you expecting?
2. Have you gained weight?This I mention for similar reasons as 
the pregnancy one. It is never necessary to comment on someone’s body or phys-ical appearance. Even if you follow up the question with, “You look much better now — more healthy and shapely,” or, 
“It looks good on you,” it is still not OK. 
Maybe the person hasn’t gained weight, maybe it doesn’t matter whether you ap-prove of the weight gain, and maybe the person is insecure about his or her body and doesn’t want to discuss it.
Maybe it is none of your business.3. Are you PMSing?I don’t understand the goal of this 
question, unless it is to irritate the per-son whom you are asking. First of all, if she’s not, you are belittling her feelings and reducing them to a stereotype. Sec-ond, if she is on her period, her feelings are still valid. Third, it is none of your 
business.
4. So, when are you hav-
ing children? How many children do you want? Are 
you and so-and-so trying to 
have a baby?
This question is offen-
sive because not all women want children. By assum-ing she wants children, you 
are reducing her role in life as a woman to a biological function. Pregnancy is not an inevitable path for all women; it is a 
choice. Second, she may want children 
and be physically unable to have them, and you are reminding her of that.
Third, it is none of your business.5. Are you sick? Are you tired? Did 
you have a bad night?
I often get this question when I’m not 
wearing makeup. And most of the time, I am neither sick nor tired; I’m just not 
wearing mascara. So by asking people 
this question, you are telling them their natural appearances aren’t satisfactory and they need to use superﬁ  cial means to follow your standards. Second, maybe the person is not feeling well and doesn’t want to talk about it.
Third, maybe people don’t have to 
explain themselves to you because it’s 
none of your business.
6. Are those real?
Yes, maybe she was born with them, 
or maybe they’re artiﬁ  cial enhance-ments. Either way, it is inappropriate for you to be asking.
7. Is that a real (insert designer la-
bel)?
Maybe I spent thousands of dollars 
on a Chanel handbag, or maybe I took a trip to Canal Street. Either way, if you can’t tell the difference, don’t expect me to clarify it for you. Perhaps the person bought a knockoff because she could not afford the real thing but wants to look as if she can, so by asking this question, you may end up embarrassing her. Also, maybe the person’s handbag is real and 
now she feels guilty or ashamed for hav-
ing spent so much money on an item and feels like you are judging her.
Last of all, it’s none of your business. Lauren Adamson is a UF journalism

The mystery and tragedy that surrounds 
the disappearance of a Malaysian jetlin-er early Saturday is a story that makes 
you want to look away, but somehow you just can’t help but stare. 
The MH370 ﬂ  ight was en route from Ma-
laysia to China when it suddenly disappeared from radars and was ofﬁ  cially deemed “miss-ing” from the knowledge of airline ofﬁ  cials. More than half of the 239 people on board were Chinese citizens.
Political tie-ups prevent any one country 
from spearheading the investigation. When the plane is found on land or in the sea, the government of said land or sea will take charge. In the meantime, efforts by multiple countries are sending about 34 planes and 40 ships in hopes of making some major recon-naissance progress.
At least two passports used to board this 
ﬂ  ight were listed as stolen in the Stolen and Lost Travel Documents database. They are identiﬁ  ed as Austrian and Italian documents. Many wonder how these two passen-gers boarded the plane original-ly, and it may not be too far of a jump to ﬁ  gure that those two pas-sengers using stolen passports had something to do with the disappearance of the Malaysian Airlines aircraft.
The plot thickens due to reports that the 
aircraft may have deviated from its original route. However, there are no signs that this change in route came from distress. This leads experts to suspect foul play. Therefore, specu-lation ensues: Was the plane hijacked? Did the plane malfunction, or did it crash? Did it land safely? Are there any survivors? But the biggest question at the moment seems to be: Where in the world is this jetliner? Investiga-tors are also looking into their radar readings, which involved the plane turning around on course before it disappeared.
No ofﬁ  cial sightings of the 
plane have been recorded — although users across various social media platforms have claimed debris sightings. After two days of searching, authori-
ties haven’t turned over any wreckage from the plane, according to The New York Times. 
It is by no fault of any one party, but it 
seems archaic that in 2014 we cannot locate a missing plane. Man’s control sometimes falls through. After the horror of Sept. 11, the U.S. tightened its belt and increased security regu-lations for boarding planes. Since then, the U.S. government has added more Federal Air Marshals aboard some domestic and interna-tional ﬂ  ights in order to prevent potential hos-tile threats. An additional safety precaution on planes includes the locking of cockpits to prevent unwanted entry. Such precautions are not conﬁ  rmed to have been used on the Ma-laysian Airlines ﬂ  ight.
It is a shame that something tragic must 
happen before new safety measures are taken. We unfortunately do not have enough fore-sight to prevent these tragedies in the ﬁ  rst place.
To this end, the friends and families of the 
passengers on ﬂ  ight MH370 are growing frus-trated with the lack of information. The story is not black and white. There are many facets to the mystery of how the plane disappeared from radars. Whatever the case, my hopes and prayers go out to those who have been af-fected.

opinions@alligator.orgI ﬁ  rst heard about Lulu a lit-
tle more than a year ago at a work party.
An app for girls to anony-
mously rate guys on looks 
and personality? How middle 
school, I thought. Not for me.
But my co-worker insisted 
through the night that all girls  should check it out.
Curiosity eventually got the 
best of me, and I, too, became a member of the Lulu community. But I couldn’t shake the thought that by using this “girls-only 
Yelp for men,” I was being a mean hypo-
crite.
That didn’t bring me to delete it, though. 
Well, it did, but not permanently.
It was too amusing to see what other 
women had to say about guys I knew. Not to mention the reaction I’d gotten used to seeing when guys who had no idea the app existed found out about it.
The ﬁ  rst question was always, “Am I on 
there?” 
Maybe I just know too many cool dudes, 
but no one was ever openly upset about whether he was reviewed.
So I kept the app, and I told myself if I 
didn’t leave any reviews, I was only being half hypocritical.
Would I want boys dishing out on my 
best and worst dating qualities? Deﬁ  nitely not.
But as of Feb. 27, thanks to a law student 
in Brazil who was not happy about being on the app without his consent, we can all use Lulu free of guilt.
Felippo de Almeida Scolari, 28, success-
fully sued Lulu for damaging his reputa-tion after being alerted to his proﬁ  le by a 
picture a friend sent him and his girlfriend. 
He’d scored 7.7 out of 10 and was consid-ered #cheaperthanbreadandbutter.
Following the lawsuit, Lulu changed its 
policy from opt-out to opt-in.
Although Scolari had every right to be 
upset, the way I see it, he was probably just using the law to his advantage and taking an opportunity to make money.
I mean, the media attention Lulu got 
from the case only drew more attention to his bad rating, which could have been much worse than if he’d sim-ply requested for it to be taken down.
Now, to appear on Lulu, 
men have to be as gung-ho 
about being reviewed as my 
former co-worker was.
Some have said the change 
was big enough to completely alter the scope of the app that was designed to “be a private 
place for girls to share their experiences and make smarter decisions.” But if you were using Lulu in a smart way in the ﬁ  rst place, 
the change is something to be celebrated 
because it makes the app consensual.
The way I see it, the proﬁ  le ratings were 
something to be taken with a grain of salt anyway because people and feelings about people are so subjective. Just because #notad**k is something you look for in a potential love interest doesn’t mean some-one else will ﬁ  nd it attractive.
Regardless of the changes, Lulu’s best 
and most underrated feature, Dear Dude, still exists.
Dear Dude, an anonymous sort of advice 
column within the app, is reason enough for anyone who is annoyed by any newly missing guy proﬁ  les to keep Lulu. And while I don’t want to turn this into an ad-vertisement about how great the feature is, 
I’ll leave you with one of my favorite pieces 
of advice from the Dude himself,
Q: “Why do guys think we like seeing 
their d**ks in pictures?”
A: “I don’t know, man, but they are 
f***king gross. I honestly don’t understand the d**k pic thing. Penises are not particu-larly aesthetic, especially when engorged, and especially when photographed from a 
bad angle with a camera boasting 4 mega-
pixels at most. The d**k pic phenomenon points to a larger problem with dudes: we obviously have no clue what you like. … The point here, and it should not be a rev-elation to you, is that all visual sexts are a risk, and should be approached with cau-tion … but the larger point is that d**ks are gross, and I totally hear you. And guys are 
totally dumb. Sorry.”

Sugar may not be needed to make strawberry short-
cakes soon.
A recent study by UF researchers pinpointed the com-
pounds that give strawberries their flavor and sweetness, 
according to a press release. This will allow varieties of 
strawberries to be produced with lower levels of sugar and 
higher levels of sweetness.
“When we started out, our goal was to make a better-
tasting strawberry,” said Michael Schwieterman, a 28-year-old UF postdoctoral researcher and lead author of the study. “What we weren’t expecting was the sweet-enhanc-ing volatiles.”
Schwieterman and his team tested 35 strawberry va-
rieties throughout two growing seasons by conducting biochemical testing and hosting taste panels in an effort to make more flavorful strawberries. But during the search for the compound related to flavor, researchers also found 
the compound directly related to sweetness.
“Those could potentially have an impact in processed 
foods where we can enhance the sweetness of a food with-
out adding a lot of extra sugar,” Schwieterman said. “That’s what we are exploring now.”
Ryan Feagle, a 22-year-old UF agricultural operations 
management junior, said he thinks it could be beneficial to decrease sugar levels in processed foods as long as it doesn’t create new problems.
Schwieterman said researchers are now looking at the 
sweetness-enhancing compounds to see what kind of broad effects they could have.
“If we get to make an effect in processed foods, students 
eat a lot of junk food,” he said. “It wouldn’t be as junky.”8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MARCH 11, 2014

� PARACOSM MAKES 3-D MODELS.
ALEXIA FERNANDEZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
A local startup company is working with Google to de-
velop new mobile technology. 
Paracosm, a company that develops 3-D reconstructions 
and models, is collaborating with Google’s Project Tango, 
which aims to create a phone with a sense of space and mo-
tion. The year-old business contributed code to the project, 
helping to make 3-D mapping available on phones.
Projects like this have helped Paracosm test and further 
develop its own software, which has the same goal in mind: creating 3-D models and reconstructions that will work on mobile devices.
Paracosm CEO Amir Rubin said working with Google 
was pure luck. A researcher who was working with Para-cosm connected it to the technology giant.
“There are some big companies working with them, and I 
think we are one of the smallest,” Rubin, 33, said.
Christian van Kleist, the 32-year-old chief technology of-
ficer of Paracosm, said Google’s project was similar to the program Paracosm was working on.
“Google is assembling a device — a phone — but needed 
the software to go with it,” he said. “That’s where we came in. The Tango phone is a complicated project, and we contrib-uted to a piece of the puzzle.”
A data test pilot program with NASA is among other proj-
ects Paracosm has been working on, Rubin said. The com-pany is also working with local organizations like the Harn Museum. 
Rubin said he expects the business’ product to be on the 
market later this year.  
“Right now we’re still testing it out, but so far the people 
we’ve worked with have been blown away by the program,” he said.
Andrew Silver, a 20-year-old UF mathematics sopho-
more, interns with Paracosm and has worked on many of the projects.
“It’s a whole new way of looking at things,” he said. “It’s 
looking at the world, but you’re able to zoom in, zoom out and look above you. Paracosm is really the future.”Local startup

STATE� THE CITY WANTS TO RAISE 
$10.8K.
KATHERINE BROWN
Alligator Contributing Writer
The City of Gainesville recently 
launched its first crowdfunding 
campaign to increase funding for the Summer Heatwave program.
The city aims to raise $10,800 
by May 24 for the program, which provides classes on life skills and 
recreational activities such as bas-
ketball tournaments for teens 13 to 19.  Teens attend during the months of June, July and August.
The money being raised through 
Citizinvestor, a Florida-based com-pany that works with local govern-ments to create crowdfunding proj-ects, would help pay the salaries of 
employees who run the programs, 
said Steven Phillips, director of  the Gainesville Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs Department.
He said the money would also be 
used to increase the number of par-ticipants from 500 to 1,000.
The program already budgeted 
$10,000 for this summer, Phillips said. An additional $10,000 would 
go directly to the city if the campaign reaches its goal by the deadline, and 
Citizinvestor would receive an $800 service fee. All campaign donations 
are tax-deductible. If the program 
does not reach its goal by the dead-line, people will not be charged.
The Summer Heatwave program will have the same number of teens as last summer if it doesn’t meet its fundraising goal, Phillips said. 
Along with Phillips’ department, 
the program is run by Gainesville Police and the State Attorney’s Of-
fice.
Lila Stewart, Gainesville’s senior 
strategic planner in the administra-
tive services department, said the idea of using Citizinvestor to raise funds for the program was devised after a City Commission meeting last November where the State Attor-ney’s Office presented data showing a correlation between the program 
and a reduction in crime.“When the City Commission 
recently expressed an interest in 
expanding the Summer Heatwave program, we thought it would be a good opportunity to try crowdfund-ing,” she said.
Gainesville Police spokesman 
Officer Ben Tobias said he believes the campaign could help with his department’s goal of forging rela-tionships between teens and police officers. Police officers will act as mentors for the students.
“Any time you have extra money 
and extra funds,” he said, “that’s many more youth we can hopefully 
help with this program.”

JACKSONVILLE — A Florida man con-
victed of attempted murder in a confrontation 
over loud music will have to wait until Friday 
at the earliest to see if a judge sentences him or 
waits until after the 47-year-old software de-veloper’s retrial on first-degree murder.
Jurors deadlocked last month on the mur-
der charge against Michael Dunn in the shoot-ing of 17-year-old Jordan Davis outside a Jack-sonville convenience store. Prosecutors have vowed to retry him on the count.
Dunn could face a maximum of 60 years 
in prison for the charges on which he has al-ready been convicted.
Dunn’s attorney asked Monday that sen-
tencing be postponed until after the second trial. Defense attorney Cory Strolla said he is 
concerned that statements Dunn makes at a 
sentencing hearing could be used against him in his second trial.Strolla also said he is 
stepping down as Dunn’s attorney and asked Judge 
Russell Healey to appoint 
public defenders.
Healey, an interim cir-
cuit judge, said he has never come across a case 
with similar circumstances

count of firing into an occupied car.

Residents will be casting their votes today 
to decide who will ﬁ  ll three commission seats 
in the Gainesville city elections.
The polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 7 p.m. 
Residents who have already registered to vote within the city limits are eligible to cast bal-
lots, but they must do so at the precinct that corresponds to their home addresses. For stu-
dents who live on campus, that precinct is the Reitz Union, said Alachua County Supervisor of Elections Pam Carpenter.
She said the Phillips Center for the Per-
forming Arts and the Florida Museum of Nat-ural History are also precincts, which encom-pass residents of some apartment complexes right off campus.
Residents can ﬁ  nd their voting precinct 
by visiting  votealachua.com/Voter-Informa-tion/Precinct-Finder.aspx.
Mayor Ed Braddy said the student vote 
is important to city elections, and students 
shouldn’t feel excluded.
“This is their city as much as it is anyone 
else’s,” he said. “They have every right and responsibility to have a say in how our city is governed.”
He said the commission touches students’ 
lives because it oversees issues such as pub-
lic safety, utilities rates, recreation and the 
Regional Transit System bus transportation 
system.
“The majority of our transit system is de-
voted to the student population, so they abso-lutely have an important role to play in terms of how we make decisions,” he said.
Candidates Annie Orlando, Donald Shep-
herd Sr., Mark Venzke and Helen Warren are running for At-Large Seat 2. Candidates Cheri Brodeur, Todd Chase and Sheryl Eddie are 
running for the District 2 seat. Susan Bottcher 
and Craig Carter are running for the District 3 seat. Voting for city elections is today
“The majority of our transit system 
is devoted to the student population, 
so they absolutely have an important 
role to play in terms of how we make 
decisions.”

Several of the Gators’ key of-
fensive veterans have gotten off to slow starts in the 2014 campaign.
Some players, such as outfield-
er Justin Shafer and utility player 
Zack Powers, have had such poor 
results at the plate it seems down-right unfair. 
Other players insist they are not 
worried about when these players 
will turn their slumps around. 
But luckily for Florida, ca-reer averages suggest that these 
players haven’t forgotten how to swing the bat — they’ve just been 
on the wrong end of spectacularly 
bad luck.“We need those guys,” coach 
Kevin O’Sullivan said. “Every team needs the older guys to have 
solid seasons. 
“They don’t have to have great 
seasons.  They don’t have to hit 
.350 … Doesn’t have to be off the charts, just got to be solid. (If) 
they’re solid, we’re going to be a 
really good team.”
The players who are slumping 
have lower-than-usual batting av-erages on balls in play. BABIP is 
a stat generally used to determine 
how “lucky” a player has been by calculating how well a player is doing when he puts the ball in play. The formula is hits minus home runs divided by the num-ber of at-bats subtracted by home runs and strikeouts plus sacrifice flies. 
While a normal batting aver-
age is typically around .260, a usual BABIP is closer to .300, ac-cording to sabermetrics website Fangraphs.com. 
Although the first 16 games 
of the Gators’ season make up a small sample size, it is more likely that the players who are doing poorly in the area will recover to close to their career averages.
Shafer is one of the players 
whose BABIP differentiates dras-tically from his career average.
Shafer, who came into the sea-
son with a career batting average of .293, has struggled to hit a mea-ger .171 in 14 games. His BABIP, which sat near average in his first two seasons, dropped to .206 — 102 points below his 2013 mark of .308.

Slumping Gators unlucky during non-conference schedule

 Although Florida (8-1, 5-1 Southeast-
ern Conference) has achieved the highest 
score in the nation this year, the Gators fell from No. 2 to No. 3 in the national rankings Monday. 
But at the end of the regular season, a 
No. 3 ranking is not cause for worry.  
UF’s 198.325 against West Virginia on March 7 not only set the record high 
in 2014 NCAA gymnastics, but it also made Florida’s record book as the third-highest overall score in UF history.
“I think we were much more solid in 
areas — we worked very hard on that. Our bar dismounts were improved this No. 3 ranking does not 
bother talented UF squadmEn’S bASkEtbAll

As long as No. 1 Florida continues its win-
ning ways, Billy Donovan is going to keep 
hearing comparisons to his past championship squads.
Fielding questions from reporters that com-
pare the current Gators to the teams from 2005-
07 has almost become a weekly ritual for the UF coach at his Monday press conferences. 
It’s understandable why. The No. 1 Gators 
finished the regular season 29-2 for their best start in school history and wrapped up the Southeastern Conference slate 18-0 — better records than Donovan’s national champion squads in 2005-06 (24-6, 10-6 SEC) and 2006-07 (26-5, 13-3 SEC). UF is also on a 23-game winning streak.
But if Donovan had his 
wish, those questions would go away.
“We want to look at the 
records and draw these par-
allels, but I’m always a little bit guarded starting to com-
pare one team to the next because it’s differ-ent,” Donovan said. “The personalities are dif-ferent, the players are different — everything’s different. 
“What these guys have done in the regular 
season has been really, really remarkable and Donovan dismisses comparisons

   After No. 1 Florida lost its Southeastern 
Conference opener on Friday against Ole 
Miss and had its 22-game winning streak 
snapped, coach Tim Walton wasn’t sure how the team was going to respond.
  “You never know what you’re going to 
get,” the ninth-year coach said. “When you have an undefeated season and you lose 
a game, you really don’t know the morale 
and what kind of shape you’ll get in the next day.”
  Following a game where the Gators were 
held to three hits — their lowest output of 
the season — and struck out a season-high 12 
times, the team rebounded at the plate in the ensuing two games to win the series against 
the Rebels.
  In those two contests, Florida outhit Ole 
Miss 17-10 and generated nine more runs in the outings.
  “Your ﬁ  rst loss, that’s tough, especially 
in the ﬁ  rst game of SEC play,” junior Lauren Haeger said. 
“It motivated us more than anything to 
have a little bit more intensity, to have more at-bats.”
  Haeger and sophomore Kelsey Stewart 
thrived in the ﬁ  rst SEC series of the season, totaling seven of Florida’s 11 RBIs. Stewart, 
who is the only Florida batter to reach base in every game this season, led the team with 
seven hits in the three games.
  But even though Florida’s offense, which 
ranks in the top ﬁ  ve among SEC teams in most statistical categories, has ﬂ  ourished when the team leads early, Walton wants to see im-
provement at the plate in closer games.
  “When you’re down, it’s hard to swing 
the bat and our team showed it,” Walton said. “But when you’re ahead, it’s a lot easier to swing the bat and our team showed it. 
“So I think we’ve got to do a better job of getting runs and leading early.”
  Gourley ﬂ  ashing leather: Although pitch-
ers generally rely on their defense to make 
plays, Delanie Gourley made a key ﬁ  elding 
play of her own against Ole Miss on Sunday.
  With Rebels shortstop Haley Culley on 
second base and one out in the sixth frame, Allison Brown hit a ground ball to Gourley’s feet. 
  Instead of making the throw to ﬁ  rst for 
an easy out and letting Culley move to third, Florida’s freshman left-hander tossed the ball 
to Stephanie Tofft at third base to tag Culley 
out and eliminate the pressure of a runner in scoring position.
  “We’ve been working on my ﬁ  elding a lot, 
a lot,” Gourley said. 
“I knew she was the head runner and we 
had a small lead. I didn’t want to risk any-thing, so I thought I’d just check her and there she was.”
Added Tofft: “It was a very smart play on 
her part. It’s deﬁ  nitely something we work on in practice, so she did it perfect. (She) checked 
the runner and we got the out, so it worked 
out great.”
  Gourley’s play was an added bonus to her 
performance in the circle. In her ﬁ  rst career SEC start, the Lakeside, Calif., native pitched her ﬁ  fth complete game and second solo 
shutout of the season.
  In her 11 appearances in the circle, Gour-
ley is averaging a team-best 1.08 strikeouts per inning and boasts a 4.38:1 strikeout-to-
walk ratio in 53 innings pitched.
  Although Gourley was content with her 
performance on Sunday, she knows that there is room for development.
  “There’s always improvements that need 
to be made,” Gourley said, “but overall I was 
pretty happy with how I did.” 14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MARCH 11, 2014

   After his women’s squad cap-
tured a Southeastern Conference 
Indoor title and the men’s team ﬁ  nished second, coach Mike Hol-loway’s track teams will head to the NCAA Indoor Champion-ships on a high note.
  Holloway was named the UST-
FCCCA South Region Women’s 2014 Indoor Coach of the Year on Monday after leading his top-ranked program to a SEC Indoor championship. Now, he faces 
the task of tak-ing 23 athletes who qualiﬁ  ed for nationals to the NCAA In-door Champi-onships in Albu-querque, N.M.
  Included in that list of athletes 
are SEC Indoor Men’s Runner of the Year Arman Hall, SEC Indoor Women’s Co-Runner of the Year Cory McGee and SEC Women’s Freshman Runner of the Year Re-bekah Greene.   In addition to their SEC hon-
ors, Hall and McGee were ap-pointed by the USTFCCCA as South Region Indoor Men’s and Women’s Athletes of the Year.
  “I think it goes back to re-
cruiting,” Holloway said. “The big thing with recruiting is we don’t ever want to be in a quote-unquote ‘rebuilding mode.’ We always want to be reloading. 
  “If you look across the board 
and you look at the people that have qualiﬁ  ed for the national meet on both the men’s and women’s teams we have people who are successful.” 
  With the NCAA champion-
ships beginning Friday, the Gators have a chance to add to their combined four national in-door titles. 
  Hall and Eddie Lovett high-
lighted the Men’s First-Team All-SEC team while eight others made the second team, includ-ing Hugh Graham Jr. and Dedric Dukes. 
  The women’s ﬁ  rst team had 
nine athletes from Florida, in-cluding McGee, Ebony Eutsey and Ciarra Brewer.   The Gators also had ﬁ  ve ﬁ  rst-
year athletes named to the All-Freshman Team. 
  Departing out west Tuesday 
night in preparation for national competition, No. 1 Florida is seek-ing better results after the men ﬁ  nished second and the women ﬁ  nished a paltry 13th.
  “There’s not a person that is 
going to get on that bus to go to Albuquerque when we leave here to go to the airport who doesn’t believe that they belong in the meet,” Holloway said. “That’s the big key.”

Lauren Haeger
UF ﬁ  rst baseman / pitcherThe junior outfielder may not recover from 
his early-season slump numbers-wise, but with a 
BABIP that low, there is a chance his luck may turn and some of the hard hits he sent directly at fielders may begin to fall.
Powers has experienced the same struggles as 
Shafer. 
In 2013, the versatile Powers hit .268 and got 
on base in nearly 39 percent of his at-bats. But he has been the worst everyday player for the Gators so far this season with a .148 batting average and .281 on-base percentage — the worst and third-worst marks on the team for players with more than 10 at-bats.
But, like Shafer, Powers is due for better per-
formance. The junior accrued a .320 BABIP last season but is down to only .190 this year — a mas-sive decline.
There is hope for these slumping players. 
Another junior teammate started off the season poorly before getting hot at the plate.
Third baseman Josh Tobias started the sea-
son in an 0-for-14 slump before cracking two hits against Florida Gulf Coast on March 1. 
But Tobias has begun turning his luck around. 
Before Florida played Connecticut last weekend, the third baseman’s BABIP was in the low .200s. 
After five hits in the series, Tobias is hitting .321 
on balls in play — a testament to a change in luck 
and the smallness of the sample size.
“Every hitter goes through that,” Tobias said. 
“I knew I was going to come back eventually. I just kept swinging and eventually it’d fall in.” 
Although some key contributors have slumped 
so far this season, there is reason to believe they 
will turn their seasons around soon — numbers 
don’t lie.
“The last couple days, the [batting practice] 
has been better,” O’Sullivan said. “Eventually it’ll 
show up. It’s not over. There’s a lot of work still to 
be done, but at least let’s show some life.”special. I would hate to have that accom-
plishment all the sudden be compared to 
something else, because what they did has been, in my opinion, totally unique and special.”
For starters, Donovan believes his 
championship teams were at a different talent level than the 2013-14 Gators, who finished the season on a 23-game win-
ning streak — something no previous 
Florida team has ever done.
Following his second consecutive 
NCAA title in 2007, Donovan saw Corey Brewer, Al Horford and Joakim Noah se-lected as lottery picks in the NBA Draft. No player on Florida’s current roster projects as a lottery selection, according to multiple mock draft websites.But after trying to differentiate both 
units Monday, Donovan drew some similarities between the groups.
“The parallels you can make is a guy 
like (Al) Horford was this big, strong, kind of physical player. Patric (Young) is like that,” Donovan said. “(Joakim) Noah was this outspoken, Patric’s got a lot of emotions, [Will Yeguete is] kind of a little bit quiet. (Lee) Humphrey shot threes, (Michael) Frazier shot threes. (Casey) Prather was an athletic wing player, Corey Brewer was like that. Scottie Wil-bekin, Taurean (Green). 
“But at the same point, you know, this 
team is a lot different. I think the thing that both teams share that would be simi-lar, in my opinion, is there is really, really 
good connection inside of our team.”
Coming off the heels of Saturday’s emotional 84-65 win against Kentucky 
in the O’Connell Center on Senior Day, No. 1 seed Florida now shifts its focus to preparing for the SEC Tournament after taking off practice Sunday and Monday.
As his program heads into the post-
season and experiences the most hype it has drawn in about seven seasons, Donovan wants his players to block out distractions — comparisons, rank-ings or whatever they may be — and focus on the common goal.
“When the ball goes up in the air, 
I don’t think our guys are running around saying, ‘We’re No. 1 in the country, we’re No. 1 in the country,’” Donovan said. “Once the ball goes up and both teams are playing, seeding, 
ranking, record, all that stuff goes out 
the window.”

Kytra Hunter performs a vault routine during Florida’s 197.525-
196.025 win against Arkansas on Feb. 14 in the O’Connell Center. 
Gymnastics rankings are based on team’s six best scores 
past Friday as well as our overall 
rotations on beam,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. 
“Vault, that’s still the area we’re 
working on getting those landings just a little bit, and it is better.”
It may seem odd for a team that 
has achieved the closest score to per-fect and the most 10s in the nation is not ranked No. 1, but gymnastics rankings are based on the average of six scores, not just one top perfor-mance. 
A team’s place in the weekly 
NCAA rankings is based on region-al qualifying scores. A team’s RQS is calculated by adding up the team’s three highest road scores and the team’s next three highest scores. The highest score of all six is subtracted from the total, and then the remain-ing amount is divided by five. 
With this math, Florida’s RQS sits behind No. 2 Oklahoma and No. 1 LSU with a 197.565. Alabama, the only team that has handed the Gators a loss this year, is right be-hind UF at No. 4. 
Making history doesn’t faze the 
2014 Florida squad too much any-more. Of the 22 perfect 10s in the history of Florida gymnastics, seven have been scored this season. Kytra Hunter has laid claim to five 10s be-tween vault and floor while sopho-more Bridget Sloan has earned a 10 on floor and beam. 
“I’ve said it so many times I al-
most sound like a broken recorder,” Faehn said. “Every time she gets out on the floor, especially for vault or floor, she really has the opportunity to score a 10.”
With only one meet left in the 
regular season, Faehn and her squad are staying focused on the real fun — the postseason — and not the rankings. 
“We know that it’s great that the team can see, and that everyone can see, that there is this tremendous tal-ent and performance level but still even greater potential,” Faehn said after her team’s win against WVU. “Friday night’s competition was def-initely the step that we were looking for getting our athletes prepared for postseason.” 
The Gators have only three days 
to prepare for their first trip to Co-lumbia, Mo., since the Tigers joined the SEC last year. 
“It’s just a matter of preparing 
our athletes in the few training days that we do have,” Faehn said. “We will be using this as an opportunity to have the lineups solidified as best we can as preparation for the SEC Championship.
“This is their favorite part of the 
season. Heading into our last regu-lar season meet and then what they always say is the real fun really starts at SECs, regionals and na-tionals.”

  The most difﬁ  cult stretch 
of the spring may be behind 
them, but the Gators still have their work cut out for them as they prepare for a plethora 
of Southeastern Conference 
matchups. 
  Florida will travel to face 
Tennessee on Friday while Georgia sits in waiting on Sunday, followed by another road trip to meet Auburn and Alabama the week after. UF will play its ﬁ  rst home match in almost a month when it is welcomed back by Arkansas and LSU on March 28 and 30, respectively.
  “Nobody has to motivate 
anybody to work this week, clearly,” said coach Roland 
Thornqvist, whose team is 
fresh off three straight SEC victories. 
“It’ll be a tough stretch for 
us, but we had some tough matches in February where I think we built some road eq-uity.”
  If Thornqvist is looking for 
an estimate, his team’s stock looks to be on the rise. 
  The No. 2 Gators (11-2, 
3-0 SEC) compiled three road wins as part of their 6-2 re-cord in February. The month 
included wins against Baylor, 
Virginia, Southern Califor-nia and Texas A&M, but two losses at the hands of North-western and Stanford. 
  Coming away with six wins against those eight op-ponents — ﬁ  ve of which are currently ranked in the top 10 — is as good of an outcome as Florida could have hoped for. 
  Overall, it was an impres-
sive month for the young team striving to match expec-
tations that exceeds the years 
of many of their players.
  “The road stuff, I thought 
we handled it well in Febru-ary, and with three freshmen, they did well,” Thornqvist said.
  “That’s part of why we 
went to the Indoors; that’s 
why we went to Stanford. I 
know we lost, but we learned. I’m hoping that those experi-ences will help us this week-end.”
  The players’ improve-
ments from match to match are evident, especially for Kourtney Keegan. The fresh-
man has excelled in doubles 
and acquired her team-best 25th doubles match victory of the season on Saturday.
  “It’s a remarkable statistic. 
Obviously that’s not by acci-dent,” Thornqvist said. “I can play Kourtney with anyone on the team and she has that 
ability to make her partner 
better. That’s rare.”
  Heading into their next 
match against Tennessee, Keegan’s teammates are hop-ing that holds true.
  The telltale sign of a Flor-
ida victory is how well its played in doubles — the team 
is 9-0 in matches when they 
have won the doubles point.
  “If we can win the doubles 
point, then I think it doesn’t really matter what team we play,” Thornqvist said. 16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MARCH 11, 2014

   The Gators had mixed results on Day 1 of 
the NCAA Zone Diving Regional Champion-
ships on Monday.
  On the women’s side, two of the three div-
ers made the ﬁ  nals, but the best man ﬁ  nished 
in the back third of a 33-man ﬁ  eld for Florida.
  In the women’s 1-meter springboard, 
s  ophomore Kahlia Warner did well enough in 
prelims to crack the top 10  and earn a spot in the ﬁ  nal, but fellow sophomore Delaney Dye came much closer to missing out. 
  Dye ﬁ  nished two spots ahead of the 18th-
place cutoff line. Sophomore Emily Mosher sat toward the back of the 44-women ﬁ  eld, 
ﬁ  nishing 30th.
  Despite improving on her score from pre-
lims to the ﬁ  nal, Dye slipped a spot and ﬁ  n-
ished in 17th place. 
  Warner scored only two points lower than 
her preliminary effort but dropped to 11th place.  Miami senior Thea Vock captured ﬁ  rst, sharing the podium with two Florida State divers: redshirt junior Katrina Young and se-
nior Ariel Rittenhouse, who ﬁ  nished second 
and third, respectively.
  It didn’t go as well for the men’s squad in 
the 3-meter boards. Its highest ﬁ  nisher was redshirt senior Chris Jones in 28th place, fol-lowed by sophomore Zach Hernandez in 32nd.
  Neither diver came close to their season 
highs. Jones was about 40 points behind his 
season-best 312 points, while Hernandez was 
more than 120 points fewer than the team-best 
356.85 point outing this season. 
  The meet will continue today with the 
men switching it up and taking on the 1-me-
ter boards and the women competing on the 3-meter springboards. UF struggles
