PEDRO BRAVO CASE
JULIA GLUM
Alligator Staff Writer jglum@alligator.org
Pedro Bravo appeared before 
another new judge for his sixth case 
management hearing Tuesday.
In the second row, eight 
Aguilars sat in an Alachua County 
courtroom for the eighth time in 16 
months.
They drove ﬁ  ve hours to 
hear Bravo’s third lawyer give yet another number: His list of witnesses in the murder case has topped 100, and it’s still climbing.
Tuesday was the deadline for 
depositions in the case against Bravo, the 20-year-old former Santa Fe College student accused of kidnapping and killing UF student Christian Aguilar in 2012. 
But defense lawyer Michael 
Ruppert said he wasn’t ready. 
“We’ve been diligent about 
taking depositions, and that’s ongoing,” he said.
Although his team has taken 
samples, swabs and pictures of evidence, he asked Judge Ysleta McDonald for 30 more days to determine the experts he needs.
State attorney Brian Kramer 
ﬁ  led a motion that would require Ruppert to provide a list of witnesses, experts and physical evidence by a certain date. 
“We are asking the court to set 
those dates and set this matter for trial,” Kramer said.
McDonald decided to organize 
a special hearing for the motion before the next case management hearing on Feb. 18.
These results didn’t surprise Murder trial delayed

A prominent UF women’s 
basketball player was sus-
pended indeﬁ  nitely after 
Alachua County Sheriff’s 
deputies took her into cus-tody Friday. 
Christin Yuri Mercer, 
of Douglasville, Ga., faces charges of conspiring to commit a robbery after dep-uties served a warrant for her arrest, according to court 
records. 
The charges were ﬁ  led 
Dec. 18.
The basketball player was 
released Friday from the Ala-
chua County Jail on her own recognizance. 
Her arraignment is set for 
Jan. 30, according to court re-
cords. 
Mercer’s suspension 
leaves Florida shorthanded. 
The Gators were already 
down to only eight active players before Mercer’s ar-
rest. 
With seven players now 
available to play, Coach 
Amanda Butler will be hard 
pressed to recoup Mercer’s presence on the ﬂ  oor, as shown by Florida’s recent 82-68 loss to Southeastern 
Conference foe No. 12 Loui-
siana State University. 
Prior to the arrest, Mercer 
was second on the team in 
points with 11.8, and third in rebounds with 5.8 per con-test. 
The 6-foot sophomore for-
ward didn’t make the trip to 
Baton Rouge, La. 
Her presence was sorely 
missed, as Florida was out-rebounded 50-29. 
In games Mercer has 
missed this season, the Gators 
have been outrebounded by 
an average margin of 40.4 to 33.4. 
With Mercer out of the 
picture for now, Florida is left with only two legitimate rebounders. 
Redshirt junior Kayla 
Lewis and freshman Ronni 
Williams, who has been deal-
ing with foul trouble all sea-son, are the team’s remaining options. Mercer’s is the ﬁ  rst 
arrest during Butler’s tenure 
as coach.UF women’s basketball player

The UF Student Health Care Center 
reordered a limited amount of ﬂ  u vac-
cines for students in response to severe 
local cases.
The SHCC ran out of ﬂ  u shots Nov. 
21 and did not intend to purchase more. 
It reversed this decision in response 
to local ﬂ  u-related hospitalizations, 
including 12 ﬂ  u-related deaths at UF Health Shands Hospital since October, said Catherine Seemann, communica-tions coordinator for the SHCC.
“We are deﬁ  nitely working to ful-
ﬁ  ll whatever requests we can based on what vaccine we can get our hands on,” she said. Seemann also said she recommends 
checking local pharmacies for vaccine 
availability. 
The SHCC is careful not to order 
a surplus of vaccines in an effort to 
conserve student health fee dollars, 
Seemann said. Any vaccines that are 
ordered this season cannot be used the following ﬂ  u season and must be thrown out if not used.
Seemann said the SHCC will try to 
gauge and accommodate demand. 
“If it goes really, really fast then 
again we’ll do another search for more vaccine,” she said.
Serra Abak, an 18-year-old UF 
computer science freshman, said she believes the SHCC’s efforts to restock vaccinations is important despite any added cost.
“Flu vaccinations should never go 
out of stock,” Abak said.Flu shots available again

With one bill approved, two res-
olutions unanimously passed and 
three newly appointed permanent replacement seats set in place, Tues-day night’s Student Senate meeting was productive. 
Seventy-ﬁ  ve senators were pres-
ent Tuesday night to unanimously pass the Resolution Supporting the Implementation of Self-Service Bike Repair Stations On Campus.
Senate President Pro-Tempore 
Elliot Grasso explained that the reso-lution supports the new self-service bike stations provided by Student Government that allow students to make simple bike repairs without having to travel to the Reitz Union.
“They purchased two bike repair 
stations … It’s basically a stand you put your bike on with a bunch of tools attached to it, and you can do all the maintenance-type stuff you need,” he said.
Grasso said the two stations are 
located in the Springs and Mur-phree areas because they are on the east and west sides of campus and will be convenient for students.
Additionally, Senate unanimous-
ly passed the Resolution Honoring Kim Lindsey and Family. Lindsey, who fell victim to domestic violence in October, is survived by her three daughters, Savannah, Soﬁ  a and Sar-ah Lambert.
Sarah Lambert, a UF student 
who attended the Senate meeting, said she was touched that the author 
of the resolution, Elianne Vazquez, 
wrote the legislation and pushed it through Senate.  
“The fact that somebody was 
willing to step up and have the en-tire university support us … was amazing,” she said.  “I really cannot express my gratitude. It means so much that me and my sisters aren’t 
alone in this.”
Senate Bill 2014-1003, which ap-
proved funding for the student 
organization Women in Science Engineering, was also passed unani-mously. 
The bill, sponsored and authored 
by the Senate Allocations Commit-tee, allocates $844.50 to WiSE for 
programming, advertising, ﬂ  iers 
and food.
Sen. Davis Bean, chair of the al-
locations committee, said the fund-ing bill for WiSE was passed unani-mously because the organization’s presentation to the committee was so well prepared. “They came to the committee, 
they rocked the presentation, they wowed the committee, and it ended up passing unanimously,” he said. “Everyone on the committee ap-proved.”
Bean mentioned that the allo-
cations committee was able to cut some costs in the organization’s 
proposed budget by suggesting that 
WiSE use the free rooms provided by the Inter-Residence Hall Asso-ciation instead of paying to use the Reitz Union room.
Daniel Mentz, Quentin Peterson 
and Meisam Sedighi were voted as the new permanent replacement seats for Building Construction, Fine 
Arts and Graduate, respectively.

Excerpt From Senate 
Bill 2014-1001 — 
Resolution Supporting 
the Implementation of 
Self-Service Bike Repair 
Stations on Campus 
“Whereas, the self-service 
bike repair stations provide 
students with repair tools and 
an air pump to perform easy 
repairs, maintenance, and adjustments on their bikes; 
and whereas, the stations 
come equipped with stainless steel cables and tamper-
proof fasteners to securely 
attach the tools and air pump, which results in little to no

As part of the Make it Reitz 
campaign, students are invited to 
voice their opinions this week on 
which chair they might be sitting 
in after construction is completed. 
Students have 17 different 
chairs to choose from, organized in 
the recreation area in front of the 
Career Resource Center.
Hannah Farrell, the Reitz Union 
Marketing Coordinator, was in charge of setting up the display 
and finding out the student opin-
ions. 
The procedure for voting at the 
site was created by Farrell and in-
spired by traffic lights. 
“The green represents your top 
choice, the yellow your second fa-
vorite and the red your least favor-ite choice,” she said
The promotion lasts until Fri-
day evening. Students can com-plete the survey in the mornings and evening sessions or online at 
makeitreitz.com/vote. Voting on-
line lasts until Jan. 24, and people can vote multiple times. 
About 250 people voted Mon-
day on-site, and about 80 people completed the survey online, she said. 
However, not all of the chairs 
made it to the end of the week. No. 3, which received many negative votes on Monday, was removed after a person fell off of it, Farrell 
said. 
Mike Koester, a UF mechanical 
and aerospace engineering senior, 
said he uses the space about two to three times a week to study.
“It is good that the student’s 
choices are being taken into ac-
count,” he said. 
Hannah Wilson, a UF telecom-
munication freshman, said she 
will miss the footrests in the older chairs. She uses the area very often 
to work and socialize. 
“This is definitely a good step 
for the Reitz to take,” she said. 4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 15, 2014

UF’s Entrepreneurship Club will be 
hosting a chat Friday between two cyber 
celebrities about their experiences with their companies. 
Reddit’s co-founder, Alexis Ohanian, 
will speak alongside Grooveshark’s co-founder and chief technology officer, Josh Greenberg at 7 p.m. Friday.
The event, in Weimer Hall’s Gannett 
Auditorium, is free and open to all UF stu-dents.
Ian Mitchell, president of the Entrepre-neurship Club, said he was looking for-ward to hosting Ohanian and Greenberg because of their important innovations in the Internet realm. 
Reddit is an online social and entertain-
ment news website that puts users in con-trol of the website’s content. 
Grooveshark enables users to stream 
music, create their own playlists and up-load their own music.
Mitchell said there is a common miscon-
ception that entrepreneurship is all about creating apps and making a profit, when in fact, entrepreneurship can help elicit social change.Mitchell said he hopes that the event 
will make “people aware of deep issues we have in our society, like copyright laws and freedom of speech.”
Mitchell said the club anticipates  the 
event to fill up quickly, so it is advised that students arrive early to secure seats. 
Students who are unable to fit in the 
auditorium may watch the talk in rooms nearby also in Weimer Hall.
At the end of the chat, students will 
have the opportunity to ask Ohanian and Greenberg questions. Ohanian will be signing his new book, 
“Without Their Permission,” which will be available for purchase.
Sebastian Restrepo, a 21-year-old UF in-
dustrial engineering senior, said he consid-ers himself a Redditor and uses the Reddit app in his downtime.
“I like the community,” Restrepo said. 
”It has people worth listening to.”
He said he had not previously heard 
of the event, but now he will definitely at-tend.
Juliana Guitelman, a 19-year-old UF 
psychology sophomore, said she will also attend the event.
“I’m really excited to meet Ohanian and 
ask him questions,” she said. “Reddit is 
awesome.” Reddit co-founder to come to UF campus for talk on Friday

� A BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS 
RUINED.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
SOUTH MIAMI, Fla. (AP) — The 
city of South Miami will pay $90,000 to 
a man whose daughter’s 15th birthday party was ruined when police officers handcuffed him and took him to a pa-
trol car.
The city recently agreed to settle the 
case which began in December 2009 
during a birthday party. South Miami police responded to a noise complaint that evening. They returned a short time later. Julio Sanchez was arrested, but later let go.
The lawsuit was first filed in state 
court in February 2011 and moved to federal court in November 2012. San-chez sued the city for battery, false arrest and civil-rights violations.
The city agreed to settle the case after 
a federal judge ruled that a portion of the noise ordinance was unconstitution-ally vague.
U.S. District Judge Cecilia Altonaga 
struck down the part of the city’s noise ordinance that made a noise illegal if it would “annoy” anyone on a nearby 
street, sidewalk or adjacent building.
Altonaga wrote that “the noise or-
dinance is clearly unconstitutional, and 
tellingly the city does not provide any argument addressing Mr. Sanchez’s contentions and analysis contained in the motion concerning the noise ordi-nance’s unconstitutionality.”
During the birthday party in 2009, 
South Miami police received a noise complaint, according to the lawsuit.
An officer was sent to the scene and 
asked Sanchez to turn down the music.
Attorney Ray Taseff said Sanchez 
complied but police received another complaint a short time later. An officer told Sanchez the party must end. San-chez eventually turned off the music. Taseff said his client asked the officer if the party could continue inside. When Sanchez asked for the officer’s name and 
badge number, he was arrested.
South Miami Mayor Phillip Stod-
dard attempted to add more specific 
language to the noise ordinance, but city leaders rejected the proposed changes.
“The police ruined my daughter’s 
party and robbed my family of the spe-cial memories that a quince party cre-ates,” Sanchez said in a release from his 
lawyer. South Miami to pay $90K settlementAguilar family 
not suprised  
Christian’s father, Carlos Aguilar.
“I think what we heard today was the outcome 
that everyone was expecting,” he said.
Aguilar said he thinks the trial will be set for May 
or June. But the delay doesn’t worry him.
“I’m very confident that the state attorney and 
local authorities ... have enough support to convince 
any jury that this person committed that crime and that he’s convicted with the sentence he deserves,” Aguilar said.
Bravo’s charges include homicide, kidnapping, 
lying to police, mishandling human remains, providing false reports, tampering with physical evidence, and poisoning food and/or water with the intent to kill or injure a person, according to court records. 
He was arrested four days after Christian went 
missing, and he remains in the Alachua County Jail.brA vo , from page 1“I like the community. It has

Two new Asian restaurants 
are spicing up University Av-
enue.
Bahn Thai opened Friday 
in the former Bella Donna’s 
location at 1023 W. University 
Ave. Small House Traditional Chinese Cuisine opened dur-ing Winter Break in the former Farah’s location, at 1120 W. University Ave., both close to Karma Cream. 
Bahn Thai is owned by a 
husband-and-wife team, Aung 
Chun and Moe Marlar-Chun. 
Both were medical profession-als in Burma and Jamaica be-fore they took over Bahn Thai from its former owners three years ago. 
“Cooking healthy meals 
is important to us,” Marlar-Chun said, attributing her 
background in the medical 
field as the inspiration for pre-paring healthy dishes. 
Bahn Thai opened for busi-
ness on Friday at its new loca-tion and served a full house the same night.
“We decided to put the sign 
out, and everyone just came in,” Marlar-Chun said. “I was surprised.”
The most popular dish so 
far is the Pad Thai, and about half of the customers who’ve come so far are vegan or veg-
etarian, Marlar-Chun said.
Megan Ely, an 18-year-
old UF zoology freshman, is 
hooked on the new Thai res-taurant. 
“I love the family atmo-sphere here,” Ely said. “The owners know me by name now. It’s nice.”
At Small House, the Szech-
uan spicy boiled fish filet is the most popular menu item, said 
Sherry Huo, a manager at the 
restaurant. 
“Everything on the menu is 
what Chinese people are very familiar with in their home country,” she said. “As good as homemade — that’s the goal here.”
Huo said the restaurant 
keeps vegans and vegetarians in mind while keeping the menu interesting. 
“We use vegetables many 
Americans are used to, and we cook them in ways they’ve never experienced before,” she said. 
Lake City resident Robert 
Morgan is already a regular at Small House. 
“I have made friends with 
some of the international stu-dents here,” Morgan said. 
Huo said the proximity to 
UF campus is good for Small House. She said groups of Chi-nese and international students 
visit every day for lunch.
“It warms my heart to see 
that they can make this place 
like home,” Huo said. “They can come here and get a meal they really enjoy eating that tastes like home.”New restaurants add

Alachua County Sheriff’s 
deputies arrested a local man 
Monday night who became bel-
ligerent after drinking bottles of 
cough syrup and large amounts of caffeine.
Deputies arrested 41-year-old 
Larry Laverne Montgomery on charges of domestic battery, ac-cording to an arrest report.
At about 10:30 p.m., deputies responded to a call that a man 
was yelling at several cars in the 
parking lot of Bellamay Grand Apartments, at 2625 SW 75th St., according to a report.
When deputies arrived, Mont-
gomery told them he drank cough syrup, several Red Bull energy drinks and a large amount of cof-fee. He was acting extremely in-
toxicated and yelling randomly, 
according to the report. 
Montgomery’s daughter came out of the apart-
ment to try to 
calm him down. 
He grabbed and held her hair, pulling out a black knit hair 
cap in the pro-
cess, according 
to the report.
Officers booked Montgomery 
into the Alachua County Jail at about 12:30 a.m. Tuesday. 
He was released at about 2 
p.m. Tuesday after meeting a $2,500 bond.Cough syrup intoxication turns battery
� “SPRING AWAKENING” IS THE 
FIRST MUSICAL IN TWO YEARS.
LELAND HENRY
Alligator Contributing Writer
A UF club is putting the spotlight on its 
new venture in hopes of drawing a greater 
audience. The student-run theater company Florida Players’ spring season now features a musical, something that has not been done by 
this club in two years.“Putting on a musical requires a lot more 
from a director,” said Kim Yeoman, a 21-year-
old UF scenic design senior and production manager for the Florida Players. “They need a choreographer, a music director and an ac-companist. It’s a big challenge for a student director.”
The Florida Players chose to include 
“Spring Awakening,” a rock musical, in its 
lineup of three shows for the semester. 
Producing a musical may be a challenge, 
but Yeoman said she believes the director can 
handle it.However, this risky choice will greatly im-
pact the Florida Players’ budget.
Katina White, a 19-year-old UF theater 
sophomore and treasurer for the Florida Play-ers, said that more of the budget, which is about $40,000, has been allotted to the musical than to the other two shows.
“We have budgeted a large chunk of mon-
ey for the rights and the score,” White said. “The props, sets and costumes will also cost more than they do for the straight plays.”

NEW YORK — The Federal 
Trade Commission said Tuesday 
that a group of defendants in Flori-da have agreed to surrender assets totaling about $3.6 million as part of 
a settlement agreement related to an 
alleged mortgage relief scam.
The defendants also will be per-
manently banned from providing mortgage relief and debt relief ser-vices to consumers.
In 2012, the FTC charged 11 com-
panies and five people with running 
an illegal mortgage relief scheme 
that operated under various names, including Prime Legal Plans. The ac-tion was part of the Distressed Ho-meowner Initiative, a multi-agency federal enforcement crackdown.
The FTC said that the mortgage relief scheme used a fake nonprofit called Reaching U Network and several other companies to lure consumers with false promises that 
enrollment would save their homes 
from foreclosure or result in lower mortgage payments. The defendants charged consumers as much as $750 a month in illegal advance fees but offered little or no help.
Aside from alleging that the scheme deceived consumers, the FTC charged that it violated the Mortgage Assistance Relief Services Rule’s ban on advance fees for mort-
gage relief and that the defendants 
made numerous calls to numbers listed on the national Do Not Call Registry.
The FTC received a court order 
shutting down the operation and freezing the defendants’ corporate and personal assets pending settle-ment of the case.
A $25.1 million judgment im-
posed on Derek Radzikowski, Jason 
Desmond, Prime Legal Plans LLC 
and five other corporate defendants will be suspended when the defen-dants surrender an estimated $3.5 million in assets. Desmond’s wife must also turn over $110,000 that she received from the scheme.

ground’ apply in 
Tampa shooting?
Sadly, this week’s headlines were dominated by two tragic 
shootings. On Tuesday morning, a 12-year-old boy opened ﬁ  re at a middle school in New Mexico, wounding two stu-
dents. According to Reuters, it was the second shooting to take place in a U.S. middle school in three months.
Even closer to home, in a Tampa movie theater Monday, a 
71-year-old retired police ofﬁ  cer, Curtis Reeves, shot a fellow moviegoer in the chest after an argument erupted over cellphone use during previews. Authorities said a man was trying to con-tact his 3-year-old daughter when the ex-ofﬁ  cer confronted him. According to witnesses, the man using his phone threw a bag of popcorn at Reeves, and Reeves proceeded to brandish a gun. 
As authorities investigate the Tampa shooting, Florida news 
outlets are already beginning to speculate: Will Reeves’ lawyers 
try to mount a “stand-your-ground” defense?
The obvious, overwhelming response is, are you crazy? The 
victim allegedly threw a bag of popcorn at Reeves — hardly an 
imminent threat of death or serious injury. And the fact that Reeves is an ex-police ofﬁ  cer plays a signiﬁ  cant role in the inves-tigation, the Tampa Bay Times said. 
According to the Times, “A defense attorney could argue 
Reeves is well-versed in stressful standoffs and has expert judg-ment on when deadly force is necessary. On the other hand, a 
prosecutor could argue that as a former ofﬁ  cer, Reeves should 
have known how to de-escalate the situation.”
All in all, however, Reeves’ defense team would be hard-
pressed to build a convincing argument that his decision to open ﬁ  re was absolutely necessary. 
The shootings we saw this week open the same debate we 
have had time and time again in this country when violence at the hands of gun users results in the injury of children and the death of citizens who simply tried to text in a movie theater. 
Of the New Mexico shooting, Reuters reported, “It comes 
amid a contentious national debate on gun control that intensi-ﬁ  ed after a gunman shot dead 20 students and six staff mem-bers at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, in December 2012. Following that attack, President Barack Obama called for sweeping new gun control measures.”
“Most of Obama’s proposals were defeated in Congress, but 
his administration proposed new regulations this month aimed at clarifying restrictions on gun ownership for the mentally ill 
and bolstering a database used for ﬁ  rearms background checks,” 
Reuters said.
While the details of the New Mexico shooting are still hazy, 
one thing is certain: security needs to be heightened in public, enclosed spaces such as arenas, stadiums and — yep — small movie theaters. 
Of course, this argument is hardly groundbreaking. The fa-
miliar wave of liberal rage will be met with a conservative blow-back, and nothing will result. It’s hard not to grow weary.
But should we stop pushing for a cultural change in the way 
this country handles ﬁ  rearm ownership?
We don’t think so.What voters need in 2014: skepticism
It’s far too easy to be cynical nowadays — especially when it comes to your opinions about politics and the government. 
Can you blame someone for being skeptical about 
campaign promises, legislative initiatives and politicians’ 
actual ambitions? When you watch the IRS scandal, the Benghazi scandal, the botched Obamacare rollout and the blown-out-of-proportion Bridgegate scandal unfold, you begin to feel cynical yourself. 
But this newly found cynicism is not necessarily a bad 
thing. In a culture of too-good-to-be-true promises and too 
many out-of-control expectations, a dab of skepticism may not be negative.    
At the beginning of the football season, when some said 
that the Gators would win the whole shebang in a glorious 
fashion, don’t you think we should have managed that ex-
pectation?       
Skepticism, especially when talking about politics, brings 
with it reserved expectations and certain weariness — which will come in handy during the 2014 election cycle. 
When talking about the role of government in our lives, 
skepticism shifts the conversation from “What should the government do?” to “What can the government do?” More 
speciﬁ  cally, “What can the government actually do well?” 
Government simply cannot do everything — but it tries. 
Obamacare now controls one-sixth of the economy. Former 
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg believed the govern-ment should control your eating and drinking habits. And if you want free birth control, just ask the government for it.  
We should cast doubt upon a government that cannot 
control its spending, cannot control its bureaucracy and can-not use our taxpayer dollars efﬁ  ciently. Having this doubt in what government actually has the ability to do tears away at 
the long-held liberal belief that government can and thereby 
should do everything. I would say that discrediting this lib-eral belief is completely healthy and quite reassuring. 
Now, I’m not saying that there is no place for government 
in society. Government does have a place. Government is in place to protect us in foreign and domestic affairs, to make the marketplace free and competitive and — to a degree — care for those who have fallen on hard times. And the government should work well and produce efﬁ  cient pieces of legislation and plans of action — I completely 
reject the culture of nihilism that 
some politicians hold. 
But when you go beyond that 
basic rendering of what the gov-ernment should do, political pro-
grams and institutions will produce disastrous results. 
New York Times columnist David Brooks penned an ar-
ticle that describes the new movement on the right as skep-tical reformism. This is a winning strategy for those on the 
right and for the country. The skeptical reformers do believe 
that the government has a role to play in society. They see what the government does both efﬁ  ciently and inefﬁ  ciently. In order to make government work, the reformers want to make government institutions work effectively while maintaining the belief that government simply cannot and should not do everything. 
The skeptical reformers would manage people’s ex-
pectations. Do you think a skeptical reformer would have 
promised a complete overhaul of the health insurance mar-
ketplace, promised exuberant enrollee numbers and made untrue promises? 
By taking a step back with our new skepticism, we be-
come able to properly govern and properly manage our expectations. We realize what agencies and institutions we have and what they should and shouldn’t do. We see the world and our government as it is, not as what it should become. Then we will be able to tackle gripping national 
problems, devoid of promising unrealistic expectations like 
defunding Obamacare and having the ability to keep your health care plan.      
Now for the larger question at hand: How many points 
will the Gators score in the 2015 BCS National Champion-ship?

Thanks to UF student lobbyists
Kudos to the approximately 30 UF 
students who lobbied legislators in 
Tallahassee on Thursday to support in-
state tuition for foreign-born students 
who meet Florida residency require-ments and graduated Florida high schools.  
State Sen. Dwight Bullard spoke at a

 UF should condemn Ringling Bros. 
Circus
It’s no surprise that the words bully 
and bullhook are so similar. 
Ringling Bros. Circus exists through 
bullying animals. Bullhooks are heavy 
batons with a sharp metal hook on the end — picture a ﬁ  replace poker.  
Elephants are beaten into submis-
sion with these cruel devices.  
These keenly intelligent, active and social animals spend the vast majority of their lives in chains. 
They learn to obey or pay the pain-
ful consequences.
Even though female elephants stay 
with their mothers for life, and males until their pre-teens, Ringling rips these infants away from their frantic moth-ers, ties them down with ropes by all 
four legs, gouges them with bullhooks 
and shocks them with electric prods to break their spirits and make them give up all hope and submit. 
They’ll spend their lives balancing 
on pedestals and jammed in fetid box-cars, traveling from one town to the next.
Why would an institute of higher 
education support this cruel industry?  
Students who care about animals 
should rise up and demand that UF tell the circus FU.

The political news of the 
last few days has been dominated by details 
of a scandal involv-
ing senior members of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s Republican 
administration. Recently 
uncovered emails re-vealed a plot among senior members of the governor’s staff to cause major trafﬁ  c jams in Fort Lee. 
Members of Christie’s staff con-
spired with employees of the New Jersey Port Authority to close ac-cess lanes to the George Washington 
Bridge as retribution for Mayor Mark 
Sokolich’s refusal to endorse Christie for re-election. 
Although no evidence has been 
presented directly implicating the 
governor in the alleged scandal, the 
thuggish behavior of his staff mem-bers could seriously damage Chris-tie’s hopes for a presidential run in 
2016.
None of these troubling develop-
ments seems to have left an impres-
sion on Florida’s own Gov. Rick Scott. 
The National Journal reports that 
Christie is expected to attend fund-raising events for Scott in Fort Lau-derdale, West Palm Beach and Orlan-
do on Saturday.
These fundraiser events are part of 
Scott’s reported goal of raising $100 
million for his re-election bid this year.
It is understandable that Scott 
would want to align himself as close-ly to Christie as possible. Despite the Fort Lee scandal, details of which are 
still emerging, Christie remains quite 
popular. A recent survey found that 55 percent of voters still hold a favor-able opinion of Christie, compared with 44 percent who view him unfa-
vorably.
In contrast, Scott remains one of 
the least popular political ﬁ  gures in 
the United States, with an abysmal 
approval rating of 33 percent. 
A recent poll from Public Policy 
Polling found that the governor trails 
presumptive Democratic nominee and former Gov. Charlie Crist by 12 
points, 50 percent for Crist to 38 per-
cent for Scott.
Scott’s unpopularity stems largely 
from several policy decisions made 
by his administration, including re-
jections of federal funding for a high-speed rail system and an expansion of Medicaid. 
Scott has also been criticized for 
supporting a bill that would require all beneﬁ  ciaries of welfare programs in the state of Florida to undergo ran-dom drug screening. Scott touted the 
initiative as a way of saving money and reducing abuse of the 
welfare system. 
Of the 4,086 people re-
quired to take drug tests as a result of the new pol-icy, only 108 — about 2.5 percent — failed. In ad-
dition, the Miami Herald 
found that the program, 
rather than having a positive impact on the state budget, actually result-ed in a net cost to the state of about 
$45,000. 
It seems unlikely that Scott is 
concerned about his popularity rat-
ings or his reputation as an enemy of 
Florida’s middle- and working-class 
families. 
After all, Scott used $73 million of 
his own money during his ﬁ  rst elec-tion bid in 2010 to erase his unseemly 
past from the public discourse.
Scott resigned as CEO of Colum-
bia/HCA, a large health care provid-
er, just before the company agreed to 
the largest Medicare fraud settlement 
in the history of the program. Under Scott’s watch, Columbia/HCA billed Medicare for non-prescribed treat-ments, claimed advertising costs as 
‘community education’ expenses and 
engaged in a number of other fraudu-lent moneymaking tactics. 
The company eventually settled 
with the federal government and re-paid over $1.7 billion in ﬁ  nes. Scott was able to avoid criminal fraud charges and jail time, instead us-ing his vast and ill-gotten fortune to 
launch his successful gubernatorial 
bid.
Scott’s crusade against nonex-
istent fraud in the Florida welfare 
system after overseeing one of the 
largest private-sector fraud schemes in recent memory is the pinnacle of hypocrisy. 
Rick Scott has demonstrated his 
brazen lack of integrity and concern for the well-being of Floridians dur-ing his tenure in both the private sec-tor and as governor of Florida. 
His willingness to associate with a 
fellow governor currently under in-vestigation by the FBI in order to raise more money from wealthy donors underscores the misplaced priorities 
of the governor and his administra-
tion. In November, Floridians will have the opportunity to reject Scott’s anti-middle-and-working-class agen-
da by voting him out of ofﬁ  ce. 
If the actions of the governor dur-
ing the past several years generate 
the outrage they deserve, no sum of money will be enough to ensure his 
political survival.

In late December, Phil Robert-
son, family patriarch of the 
hit A&E show “Duck Dynas-
ty,” was suspended for contro-
versial comments he made about 
black people and gay people to the men’s 
magazine GQ. The statements made by 
Robertson, however, ended up saying more 
about society’s cultural reaction to someone voicing an unpopular opinion than it did of Robertson’s individual beliefs.
The First Amendment states, “Congress 
shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech,” and this basic sentiment allows 
us to draw two conclusions. The ﬁ  rst is 
that A&E was well within its constitutional right to suspend Robertson from the show. 
A&E is a private network that can choose 
to suspend, ﬁ  re or otherwise punish an em-
ployee who presumably violates his or her 
contract with the network. So those decry-ing the downfall of the First Amendment 
might want to pump the brakes.
The second conclusion that can be 
drawn is about hypocrisy of those on the 
anti-Christian side — a safe categorization, 
seeing as Robertson based his statements 
on the Bible — came out saying A&E didn’t go far enough and that it should have ﬁ  red 
Robertson and his family for their beliefs. 
Unfortunately for those worrying about the downfall of human rights at Robertson’s 
hands, the First Amendment has nothing 
to do with being offended. It doesn’t say, 
“Congress shall make no law abridging the 
freedom of speech … ‘unless your feelings get hurt or you disagree in any way.’”
Before gay marriage became the widely 
accepted cultural movement it is today, those in support of it faced the same “just stop talking” sentiment critics are now 
throwing at people such as Phil Robertson. 
How easily people forget the value of being able to express their opinions when those 
opinions become culturally popular. How 
easily they toss around the word “bigot” without realizing it has a far more wide-
spread application than they care to admit.
“Bigot,” according to Merriam-Webster, 
is a person who is intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices. 
Just as those who disagree with Rob-ertson on the issue of gay mar-
riage want to change freedom 
of speech to only include the 
things they ﬁ  nd palatable, they also want to change the word 
bigot to only apply to those with religious convictions.
And “prejudice, ” according to Merriam-
Webster, is a preformed opinion, usually an unfavorable one, based on insufﬁ  cient knowledge, irrational feelings or inaccurate 
stereotypes.
Having clariﬁ  ed prejudice, we can now 
more accurately deﬁ  ne a bigot as someone who is intolerantly devoted to his or her 
own negative opinions. But is it not bigoted to decide anyone who doesn’t support gay 
marriage is hateful and intolerant? Attack-
ing Phil Robertson for his choice to exercise 
his own freedom of speech and his own 
freedom of religion allows people to misuse the word bigot and pervert a constitution 
they claim is being perverted and misrep-
resent a religion they’ve taken just enough time to learn about so they can make a com-ment about whether Robertson should eat 
shellﬁ  sh.
At all costs , the people calling those who 
oppose gay marriage bigoted have to keep going. Because those who like to use the 
word bigoted conveniently spend so much time attacking the rest of the population 
that they haven’t looked in the mirror long 
enough to realize that their behavior and 
language makes them exactly the boogey 
man they’re scared of — people intolerant-ly devoted to a preformed negative opinion 
about an entire group of people.
So maybe it’s time to take a step back 
and look at our own behavior. Before decid-
ing someone is a redneck or a bigot for not 
agreeing with a culturally popular opinion, 
we should look at how we express those beliefs. Before calling people names like a 
nation of third graders, we should take a 
minute to evaluate whether those words come from our own place of bigotry.
After that, we can talk about the shell-
ﬁ  sh thing.

The 32nd Kanapaha Botanical 
Gardens bamboo sale is under-
way.
During the sale, which runs 
through February, 14 varieties of 
bamboo are “dug to order” from 
the garden’s surplus supply, said Chief Supervisor Adam Maxwell.
The least expensive bamboo 
plant, a 5-gallon Chinese Goddess, costs $45. The most expensive is $385.
All of the funds from the sale will go toward maintaining Ka-napaha Gardens, which is a non-profit organization.
The gardens, at 4700 SW 58th 
Drive, maintains the largest public collection of bamboo species in the state, according to its website.
Maxwell said the ideal bamboo 
owner has a home instead of an apartment because the plants grow tall and require sunlight.
“If you have a yard, we defi-
nitely have bamboo that would fit it,” Maxwell said.
As for maintenance, gardens 
director Alexis Caffrey said there isn’t much to worry about.
“Bamboo is one of the easiest 
plants to take care of,” Caffrey said. 
Katlynn Cunningham, a 
19-year-old UF public relations sophomore, said she’s had good experiences with bamboo mainte-nance in the past.
“If it doesn’t require a lot of 
work, I’m down,” she said.
Bamboo sizes and types for sale 
at the Gardens are listed at kanap-aha.org. Customers should call the gardens at 352-372-4981 to place orders.
The gardens will also host a 
workshop for beginning bamboo 
owners on Saturday from 1:30 to 
4:30 p.m.8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 15, 2014

Gainesville Fire Rescue 
pulled a construction work-
er out of a collapsed trench 
Monday afternoon after a 
14-foot wall of clay and sand trapped him.
Workers were on site by 
a stormwater vault at 800 SE Fourth St. when the wall of the trench collapsed and pinned a worker to the vault, said Gainesville Fire Rescue 
Lt. Don Campbell.
Fellow construction work-
ers used their hands and 
shovels to free the man from 
the dirt, which weighs about 
100 pounds per cubic foot, Campbell said.
Firefighters and members 
of GFR’s technical rescue 
team arrived at about 4 p.m. to find the worker mostly 
freed from the sand and clay. They latched a backboard to a ladder to remove him from 
the hole. 
“That was really the only 
way we could get him out 
without causing the trench to 
collapse any farther,” Camp-
bell said. 
Firefighters pulled the 
worker from the hole within minutes, and he was rushed 
to UF Health Shands Hospi-
tal under a trauma alert.
The instability of the 
ground caused a tricky situa-
tion for rescuers, said Deputy 
Chief Jeff Lane. An overhang of dirt and debris could have collapsed at any moment. 
“(Members of the tech-
nical team) had to accept higher risks than they are normally comfortable with,” he said.Firefighters rescue

� SAME LEGISLATOR 
APPOINTED AS LT. GOV.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MIAMI — Florida Gov. Rick 
Scott, already in a potentially 
tough fight for re-election, made history Tuesday when he ap-pointed the first Hispanic to the 
position of lieutenant governor.
Ending a guessing game that 
stretched on for nearly 10 months, 
Scott named Miami-Dade Proper-ty Appraiser Carlos Lopez-Can-tera to the post. Lopez-Cantera will also be Scott’s running mate in the November elections.
Lopez-Cantera, a Republican 
and an ally of U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., called the appoint-ment an honor.
“It’s just an opportunity that 
could not be ignored or denied because I’ll be representing the entire state,” Lopez-Cantera said.
The job of lieutenant governor 
is largely ceremonial, but Scott said he plans to use the 40-year-old former legislator to help push through his legislative agenda during the session that starts in March.
More importantly, the selec-
tion of Lopez-Cantera brings both ethnic and geographical di-
versity to the Republican ticket in 
November. Lopez-Cantera was born in Madrid, but was raised in Miami.
“He checks all the boxes for 
the governor,” said Al Cardenas, former head of the Florida Repub-lican Party and chairman of the American Conservative Union. 
“He’s a young, Hispanic, talent-
ed office holder with a beautiful family and a great record.”
Scott brushed 
aside any talk 
that his selection would aid him politically in a race where polls 
have shown him 
trailing Demo-crat and former Gov. Charlie 
Crist.
“I picked someone who is go-
ing to help get our state back to work,” Scott said.
Lopez-Cantera downplayed 
his heritage, saying he didn’t want to be defined by that but joked that “there will be a little more Cuban coffee in the gover-nor’s office.”
Democrats portrayed the selec-
tion of Lopez-Cantera as a cynical move to detract from Scott’s sup-port for policies such as his initial 
support for an Arizona-style im-
migration law or last year’s veto of a bill that would have allowed some young undocumented im-migrants to apply for a tempo-rary driver’s license. 
“This is exactly the kind of 
pandering choice that has made Rick Scott one of the most unpop-
ular governors in America,” said 
Florida Democratic Party politi-cal director Christian Ulvert.

into his new job on Feb. 3.Gov. Scott taps Hispanic

From now on, UF students 
will not have to wait in line or 
leave their seats at the library to grab a cup of coffee.
A new coffee delivery ser-
vice called GoJoe began to de-liver cups of coffee to their first customers on UF’s campus Tuesday. 
Spencer Muratides, a 
22-year-old UF real estate grad-uate student and the founder of GoJoe, said that for this week, the company is currently using 
100 testers who signed up dur-
ing a tabling session in Novem-ber.  
These testers can send a text 
message with their locations, and within about seven min-utes, a GoJoe employee will arrive on a bicycle with hot cof-fee.
The business will be open to 
anyone on campus beginning next week and will be accom-panied by an app, he said.
“The app will allow you to 
drop a pin at your location, pay for the order and tip for the de-livery all at once,” Muratides said. “The goal is for customers 
to be able to stick their arm out 
the door and grab a coffee.”
Customers can order a 
16-ounce coffee for about $3.
GoJoe currently brews and 
delivers coffee from its spon-sor, The Swamp Restaurant, at the corner of West University Avenue and Northwest 17th 
Street.
The company offers a free 
cup of coffee to unsatisfied cus-tomers and uses 100 percent 
biodegradable cups, Muratides said.
“At the end of each day, we 
want to give back to the stu-dents,” he said. “That’s why I 
started this company.”
Muratides said the idea 
came to him when he was at a 
coffee shop at the Hough Grad-uate School of Business on UF’s campus.
“It was only open from 8 
a.m. to 3 p.m., and it was always so busy,” he said.  “I would see 
people walk away from the line 
because they were so tired of waiting.”
The business filed to offi-
cially become a limited liability company at the end of October.  Ten employees now help run the business.
Each driver carries a 
30-pound coffee tank with a nozzle in a backpack, a sleeve of cups and a fanny pack filled with creamer, sugar and stir-rers.
The tanks GoJoe uses were 
custom-created for the busi-ness with parts from Italy and Canada, Muratides said.
“The tanks were engineered 
to create a layer of creme in each cup to give the coffee a more-smooth flavor,” he said. “We’ve had people tell us that you don’t even need to add creamer to our coffee.”
Kelsey Torgerson, a 21-year-
old UF political science junior, 
said she buys coffee on the go 
about six days a week and is looking forward to GoJoe.
“GoJoe would be a great and 
feasible alternative,” Torgerson said in an email. “A cup of cof-fee delivered right to my seat – now that is what I call first-class service.”UF students pedal

A UF organization is hoping 
to use social media to serve the 
Gainesville community. 
The Center for Leadership and 
Service is working with Student 
Government to launch #UFgives-
back, a campaign that will help track students’ community service work. 
Community Involvement and 
Service Director Kathryn Bonti said students will be taught how to con-nect volunteer work with technol-ogy they already use.
“We know students are do-
ing service,” Bonti said. “We just haven’t had a way to track it until now.”She said UF hasn’t been a strong 
contender for the President’s Com-munity Service Honor Roll for High-er Education, which is  a national award, in several years because CLS 
staff suspects students don’t report 
all their community service hours. 
Now, when students post infor-
mation about their community ser-vice work to Facebook, Twitter or Instagram using the hashtag #UF-givesback, the CLS can use analytics to track their efforts, Bonti said. 
“We really want to get people to 
see that there’s a larger community that you can be a part of,” she said.
Daniel Sibol, CLS community 
engagement coordinator, said though most students are only in Gainesville for four years, it’s im-
portant to get involved early.
“Get off campus, experience

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WESLEY CHAPEL, Fla. — Chad Oulson 
was described by friends as a man who loved 
dirt bikes and his baby daughter. 
Curtis Reeves was a retired Tampa police 
officer with numerous commendations who 
liked riding his motorcycle with his wife.
The men’s lives collided in a movie theater 
altercation that left Oulson dead and Reeves 
in jail. Oulson was texting his daughter’s daycare, friends said, and Reeves got mad. Authorities said Reeves shot and killed Oul-son with a handgun after the men exchanged words.
“He must have just snapped,” neighbor 
Joe D’Andrea said of Reeves, describing him as a friendly, stand-up guy. “I’m trying to put all of this together.”
Reeves’ personnel files from the police de-
partment show he led other agencies in gun safety training and received numerous letters of commendation for his leadership.
Still, Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco 
said Tuesday: “It didn’t matter what he had done previously in his life. You don’t shoot someone over a texting incident.”
During Reeves’ first court appearance 
Tuesday, Judge Lynn Tepper ordered the 71-
year-old held without bond on a second-de-
gree murder charge pending a bond hearing.
Pasco County Sheriff’s officials said Reeves 
initially asked Oulson to stop texting at the theater in Wesley Chapel, a suburb about a half-hour north of downtown Tampa.
Sheriff’s Detective Allen Proctor wrote 
that Reeves spoke to Oulson during the mov-ie previews, then got up and informed man-
agement.
When Reeves returned to his seat, “addi-
tional words were exchanged,” and Oulson 
threw a bag of popcorn at Reeves, the report said.
After officers read him his rights, Reeves 
told the detective that Oulson struck him in the face with an unknown object, and that’s when he removed a .380 caliber gun from his 
pants pocket. 
The report said Reeves fired the gun and 
struck Oulson once in the chest and that he “was in fear of being attacked.”
The sheriff said at a news conference that 
Reeves’ son — who was off duty from his job 
as a Tampa officer — was walking into the 
theater when the shooting happened. Nocco 
said Reeves briefly struggled with an off-du-ty deputy but released the weapon. The gun was jammed and unable to fire again.
Pasco Sgt. Steve Greiner was among the 
first officers in the theater. When asked about Reeves’ demeanor, Greiner replied: “He was very calm. He was seated in the chair, look-ing at the screen.”
At the hearing, Judge Lynn Tepper said 
she found the evidence significant enough to warrant the no bond order.
Reeves faces life in prison if convicted. He 
only spoke once during his court appearance, to say “yes, ma’am” to the judge when she asked him if he could afford to hire his own attorney. Reeves, who appeared in court via a video link from the jail, appeared to be wear-
ing a bulletproof vest without a shirt under-
neath.
Reeves’ attorney, Richard Escobar, argued that his client should be released because of his deep ties to the community.
“The alleged victim attacked him,” Esco-
bar said, adding that Oulson threw some-
thing, possibly popcorn, at Reeves. “At that 
point in time, he has every right to defend himself.”
The judge said that throwing “an un-
known object does not equal taking out a gun” and shooting someone.
Escobar said Reeves has lived in the Tam-
pa Bay area almost his entire life and worked at the Tampa Police department for more than 
two decades until his retirement in 1993. 
Reeves’ home in Hernando County lies 
north of the movie theater. Neighbors said 
that Reeves and his wife moved to the rural subdivision about 10 years ago.
Everyone in the neighborhood knew 
that Reeves was a retired police officer, said D’Andrea, the neighbor.
“He was a stand-up guy in the neighbor-
hood,” D’Andrea said. “I would not think he was the type of guy to do something like that.”
Shooter in fatal Tampa theater fight ‘must have just snapped’stAte“Get off campus, 
experience Gainesville and 
give back to the community 
you’ve been adopted into.”

The last time the Gators had a home win-
ning streak of 24 games, Billy Donovan was 
coaching Joakim Noah, Corey Brewer and Al 
Horford to two straight national champion-
ships.
But on Tuesday night, the longtime coach 
just needed Michael Frazier II to defeat Geor-gia 72-50 and extend No. 7 Florida’s (14-2, 
3-0 Southeastern Conference) home winning 
streak to a school-record 25 games.
The sophomore guard, who came into 
Tuesday night’s contest leading the SEC 
with a 48.1 three-point shooting percentage, 
finished his performance against the Bull-dogs with a career-high 21 points. He shot 7 of 16 from the floor, including 5 of 12 from beyond the arc.
However, if it wasn’t for his coaches and 
teammates urging him to shoot more, Frazier would have finished the night with a dismal three-point shooting night.
Georgia (8-7, 2-1 SEC) held the Florida 
sharpshooter to 1 of 8 behind the arc through 
the first 32 minutes of the game.
“I can see Michael Frazier — sometimes 
he misses a couple and it’s like he’s keeping 
inventory,” Donovan said. “You know the 
guy is shooting 50 percent from the three-
point line. Keep letting them go, it will all even itself out.”
Although the Gators had a 17-point lead 
with 7:32 in the game, Donovan kept harp-
ing on Frazier to let loose when he had the 
chance. With the encouragement from the bench and his teammates on the court, Fra-zier evened out his night by hitting four 
straight threes in just fewer than four min-
utes.
Frazier said he couldn’t have had this type 
of turnaround in a game last year because he has gained confidence through experience.
“I probably would have stopped shoot-
ing and really just defer,” the 6-foot-4 guard said. “But I think that’s why I’m starting to 
mature as a player (and) kind of let the last 
shot go. I’m still getting better at that, but it’s all part of the process of maturing.”
Florida as a whole matured offensively by 
turning the ball over just eight times, which tied a season low. The Gators complemented the low number of turnovers with 18 assists, which was just one shy of tying a season

Florida’s list of starting quarter-
backs the past four seasons has been 
a who’s who of wasted talent and 
missed opportunity.
With John Brantley, Jacoby Bris-
sett, Jeff Driskel, Tyler Murphy and 
Skyler Mornhinweg all getting a 
chance to take the helm, the Gators 
have not finished better than 88th in the nation in passing offense — fall-ing to as low as 118th in 2012.
A second year 
under offen-sive coordinator Brent Pease did 
not alleviate the passing woes — 
Florida finished 109th in passing of-
fense in 2013 — so Pease was fired, to the delight of many Gators fans.
Now, coach Will Muschamp is 
looking to Kurt Roper, who was hired as offensive coordinator on 
Dec. 26, 2013, to reverse that trend. 
Muschamp’s job depends on it.
“You are what your record is,” 
Muschamp said. “I’m a 4-8 coach, and we’ve got a 4-8 ball club. We need to 
work hard to get better and improve 
in every facet.”
Luckily for Muschamp, Roper 
has a history of coaching up quarter-
backs. 
As the passing game coordinator 
and quarterbacks coach at Ole Miss, 
the 41-year-old helped Eli Manning become the Southeastern Conference 
Offensive Player of the Year and the 
No. 1 pick in the 2004 NFL Draft.
At Duke, where he was the offen-
sive coordinator under David Cutc-
liffe, he coached Thaddeus Lewis and 
Sean Renfree. Both went on to make NFL rosters.
“Kurt Roper’s name kept coming 
up,” Muschamp said. “I did a lot of 
research, talked to a lot of people, 
found out a lot of things looking into his background … He did a fantastic job there developing Eli Manning as 
his quarterback.”
But the proverbial cupboard at 
Florida may be bordering on empty.

Claire Boyce and Silvia 
Colussi-Pelaez may not be 
close in height, but Florida’s 
two freshmen are close. They 
see a lot of each other, both at practice and when they get home.
“We’re around each other 
all the time,” Boyce said. 
“I mean we live together, we were on pretty much the same schedule last semester, 
and so we really try and stick 
together and be there for each other because there is only two of us, so we’ve got to be close.”
At UF’s first meet of the 
season, the 5-foot-6 Boyce and 5-foot-2 Colussi-Pelaez took different paths. Boyce 
competed in the beam (9.850) 
and floor (9.825) events, while Colussi-Pelaez exhibitioned in uneven bars and floor. 
“It was a really great thing 
to be a part of,” Boyce said. 
“I didn’t want to have 
expectations, because I just wanted to see and be in the 
moment.” 
Colussi-Pelaez, who spent 
most of the fall training with 
the Spanish national team to 
compete at the 2013 World 
Championship, struggled in adjusting to 
c o l l e g i a t e 
competition. 
“It’s just

National Signing Day is fewer than three 
weeks away, and despite Florida currently 
having 20 commits — including nine early 
enrollees on campus — there is still a lot of 
work to be done on the recruiting trail. 
In the past month, the Gators lost the 
top running back and wide receiver pros-
pects from their class — Dalvin Cook and 
Ermon Lane, respectively. They replaced the loss of Cook by swaying running back Brandon Powell away from Miami, and he arrived on campus on Friday — just in time to enroll early.
Lane decommitted from UF on Friday 
evening. The best replacement for him would be JUCO wideout Eric Lauderdale, 
who also has offers from Arizona State and 
Oregon. 
The two Pac-12 Conference schools may 
have the upper hand in the four-star pros-
pect’s decision. He will visit Tucson, Ariz., 
this weekend and Eugene, Ore., the fol-lowing week. 
Another replacement, three-star wide 
receiver Isaiah McKenzie, will take his of-
ﬁ  cial visit to Gainesville this weekend. Of the nine early enrollees currently on 
campus, only a few can make an impact 
immediately in 2014. 
Three offensive linemen — Drew Sar-
vary, Kavaris Harkless and Nolan Kelleher — have already enrolled. 
With the Gators returning just ﬁ  ve play-
ers with starting experience along the of-
fensive line, the young linemen may need 
to take reps early.
“We have what we have, and we’re go-
ing to make the best out of those guys,” offensive line coach Mike Summers said. 
“I just came out of a situation where we 
didn’t have a lot of depth and were able to be fairly successful.
 “I’m concerned that at some point we 
need to build depth, and we need to devel-op young players into experienced play-ers, but I’m also encouraged by the players that are on this team.”
As a JUCO transfer, Savary adds matu-
rity and experience to the line. The 6-foot-5, 310-pound lineman ﬁ  nished the 2013 season at Tyler (Texas) Junior College, but he originally hails from Tallahassee. 
The offensive linemen in UF’s 2014 class 
have a mix of versatile and one-position guys. 
Summers said that in his 30-plus years 
of coaching, sometimes moving players 
around the line sometimes pays off but 
doesn’t work in every case. 
“I’ve been in years where we haven’t 
had very much depth, and tackles have 
had to play guard, and centers have had 
to play tackle and we’ve had to mix and match,” he said. 
“But certainly, I think our development 
happens faster if we can ﬁ  nd the best posi-tion for each guy and we can develop them in that position.”
Prospects of note: Five-star athlete 
Adoree’ Jackson out of Gardena, Calif., is still considering Florida. 
He is more likely to choose USC or 
UCLA so he can stay closer to home. 
However, he could end 
up at Florida and make an 
immediate impact play-
ing either defensive back or wide receiver. 
Offensive tackle Da-
mian Prince, from For-
estville, Md., is one of the 
most talented tackles in 
the 2014 class. He was offered by Florida as well as Maryland and South Carolina. 
Florida could have the upper hand here. 
Prince will take his ﬁ  nal ofﬁ  cial visit to Gainesville on the Jan. 31 — just ﬁ  ve days before National Signing Day. His friend-ship with cornerback Jalen Tabor, another 
early enrollee, could also be a factor. 
Coaches on the move: It was announced 
Tuesday afternoon, per various sources, 
that Florida State defensive coordinator 
Jeremy Pruitt would join Mark Richt’s staff 
as defensive coordinator. 
Pruitt is an excellent recruiter and could 
make four-star defensive end and UF tar-get Lorenzo Carter to a lock to go to UGA. 
Pruitt may also attempt to grab some re-
cruits from Florida State’s highly ranked class.
In addition, longtime PSU assistant 
Larry Johnson will reportedly be joining Urban Meyer as the defensive line coach at Ohio State University. 
That could swing four-star defensive 
tackle Thomas Holley, a PSU commit, to the Buckeyes as well.14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 15, 2014

meet ever, and they wanted to get me out there and see how I per-
formed.” 
After sustaining a fall on the uneven bars, Colussi-Pelaez admitted 
she did not have the best performance, but she hopes to gain a spot on 
the Florida lineup against Auburn. 
“I just kind of got ahead of myself and was thinking about the end 
so I had a fall,” Colussi-Pelaez said. “I’m really hoping to work really 
hard on my consistency and be able to make the lineup.” 
Coach Rhonda Faehn said she was happy with Boyce’s perfor-
mance and plans on keeping her in the lineup for UF’s away meet against Auburn on Friday. 
“She went out and competed like an upperclassman, like a pro,” 
Faehn said of Boyce, who placed fourth overall in balance beam and tied for eighth on floor.  
As far as Colussi-Pelaez’s position on the lineup, Faehn is unsure. 
“For Silvia, I think it was an eye opener,” Faehn said. “She has tre-
mendous potential, and it’s a matter of her continuing to learn each 
time and to not let herself get overwhelmed.” 
As of Tuesday, Boyce is set to compete on floor and beam at Au-
burn. Faehn said she could possibly exhibition on bars, too. She added 
vault is not likely for Boyce because of the risk for injury to her legs, 
which would take her off floor and beam — her strongest competi-tions.
Colussi-Pelaez could possibly compete in floor. If not, she will at 
least exhibition her floor routine, Faehn said. 
“We wanted her to exhibition vault at UCLA but she just didn’t 
really have a great warm-up, so we choose not to,” Faehn said. “We’d like to be able to see her get out there for that and possibly bars again as well.” high as a team.
The 18:8 assists to turnover ra-
tio was Florida’s most efficient of 
the year.
“We’re getting better,” Dono-
van said of his squad’s ball move-
ment. “The press helped us a 
little bit with our assists because 
we had some open floor situa-tions. The biggest thing is if you look at our guards, (they had) 10 assists combined — 10 assists, no 
turnovers, which helps.”
In addition to the efficient 
backcourt performance by the 
Gators, their frontcourt provided 
the team with key second chance 
opportunities.
For the first time in SEC play, 
Florida did not lose the rebound-
ing battle. Each of the teams fin-
ished the night with 23 defensive and 11 offensive boards. 
Patric Young, who was hon-
ored at the O’Connell Center 
with “Patric Young Beard Night,” 
finished the game with 10 points and nine rebounds — just one rebound shy of his first double-double of the year.
The senior center said the re-
bounding efficiency of the Gators is vital if they want to play the up-tempo style of basketball that 
Donovan expects.
“Whenever you can be really 
physical and a team has to focus 
more on their defensive rebound-ing (and) we’re being a problem for them on the offensive glass, it’s going to wear their bigs out,” Young said. 
“And in doing that, we’re playing more our style of play of trying to get up and down the floor, playing hard and like coach Donovan said, ‘Being dogs.’”but struggled early before suf-fering a season-ending fractured 
fibula in the first quarter against 
Tennessee on Sept. 21, 2013. 
Murphy, his replacement, left 
the program after the season and 
announced on Tuesday that he 
was enrolling at Boston College, joining former Florida offensive coordinator Steve Addazio with the Eagles.
Mornhinweg struggled in 
three late-season starts, and he will likely be jumped on the depth chart by early-enrolling 
quarterback Will Grier.
Grier, a Davidson, N.C., na-
tive, may be the most talented  
signal-caller Roper has to work with in the spread-based, up-
tempo offense he is bringing to 
UF. He put up video-game num-bers at Davidson Day High and looks to translate those skills to 
college.
“You knew Will was real tal-
ented and was going to be heavily 
recruited,” Roper said of seeing Grier at camps while he coached at Duke. “He has a great mindset. I think he has a great quarterback demeanor, and then, I tell you 
what, he was accurate. He can throw it. He has a fast arm. I look 
for a guy that when he turns it loose, his arm speed is really con-sistently fast.”
Although Grier may have the 
talent, Driskel has the experience. Muschamp said on Monday that the junior is expected to be ready for spring practice. Roper said he tried to recruit Driskel out of high school, and he is excited to work with the quarterback now.
“He’s a guy that I tried to get 
in on early as a junior,” Roper 
said. 
“I thought he was an outstand-
ing talent.”
Muschamp said every posi-
tion is open after last year’s poor 
results, and Roper is waiting un-
til the team gets back on the field 
to make a final decision.
“I don’t want to develop opin-
ions sitting and getting some-
body else’s thought on a guy or 
watching tape,” Roper said. “I want to develop those opinions on the grass.”WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 15, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

WASHINGTON (AP) — For President 
Barack Obama, seeing the Miami Heat at 
the White House on Tuesday was like deja vu.
A year after congratulating LeBron 
James and company on winning their second league title, Obama was doing it again. And so soon.
James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, their 
teammates and coaches, earned another White House visit by following that cham-pionship win with another last year. They topped the San Antonio Spurs in series that went the full seven games. A big bas-
ketball fan and recreational player, Obama 
described in detail how the Heat rallied from behind with less than a minute on the clock to win Game 6 before clinching in the seventh.
“This group has now won twice but it’s 
gone to the ﬁ  nals three times and, some-times, it feels like they’re still ﬁ  ghting for a little respect,” Obama said, adding: “I can 
relate to that.”
The Heat won NBA titles in 2006, 2012 and last year.
During an East Room ceremony, Obama 
also praised the team’s off-court actions. 
The players visited wounded service mem-bers recuperating at an area military hos-pital before they came to the White House. Obama said it’s an example of the chari-table work Heat players do year-round, in-cluding raising nearly $2 million last year for charities at home.
“So bottom line is: outstanding ath-
letes, outstanding organization, outstand-ing team but also outstanding members of their community,” Obama said.
He wished them “great luck” for the 
rest of the current season, “unless they’re playing the (Chicago) Bulls,” Obama’s hometown and favorite NBA team.
Coach Erik Spoelstra presented Obama 
with a commemorative championship tro-
phy that lists the players’ names as well as 
Obama’s. The president also received an autographed basketball and team jersey with the number “44” and “POTUS” on the back. Obama is the 44th president and “POTUS” is an abbreviation for “president of the United States.”
“This is a great honor for the entire Mi-ami Heat family,” Spoelstra said. “It does not get old.”

Two new recruits have joined 
the Gators men’s swimming and 
diving team. Sophomore Nick Alexiou, a transfer from Virginia, and Enzo Martinez, a freshman 
from Uruguay, both enrolled for 
the spring semester and have been cleared by the NCAA to compete.
However, Florida’s coaching 
staff is still deciding whether it wants to use a year of eligibility or have the two swimmers redshirt this season.
“Both of them come in, and 
we’re not quite as sure what their backgrounds are because the ﬁ  rst semester for Nick was in transi-tion,” said coach Gregg Troy. 
“Enzo is coming from another 
country, so we haven’t decided in fact whether they’ll swim or whether they’ll redshirt. It depends a little bit on what we see.”
Alexiou — a 2013 All-American 
in the 800-yard freestyle relay his freshman year — is a familiar face for Troy. The Gators scouted the back-
stroke and freestyle specialist from Clearwater High.
Troy said he is thinking about 
the future of the program and what Alexiou brings to the table. 
With Alexiou having three 
years of his eligibility remaining, keeping him out this year looks to beneﬁ  t the program down the road.
UF’s class is already strong. 
Florida landed the top sprinter in the 2014 recruiting class, Cae-leb Dressel, and now it bolsters its sprinting group with Martinez, a 50- and 100-yard freestyler who swam the latter at the 15th FINA World Championships in Barce-lona in the summer.His only real chance at compet-
ing this year hinges on his ability to make an impact in the 200-yard freestyle relay, but his role has not been determined yet. 
With only three dual meets 
remaining on the schedule, the Gators’ main focus at this point in the season is on the conference and national championship meets.
“They’re kind of like dress re-
hearsals,” Troy said, “so we’re go-ing to go through the same sort of routine that we would at the end of the year.”
