Trekkies can reunite with former Star 
Trek actor and social justice activist George 
Takei on Oct. 7.
Accent Speaker’s Bureau, Pride Student 
Union and the Asian American Student Union chipped in to pay $45,000 for the Star Trek actor to speak during Pride His-tory Week and Asian Kaleidoscope month, said Accent chairman Corey Flayman.
Takei is known for playing Hikaru 
Sulu, helmsman of the Starship Enterprise on the Star Trek TV series.
“He’s going to talk about his activism 
for the LGBT community and his experi-ence as an Asian-Ameri-can,” Flayman said.
At the event, which 
starts at 8 p.m., Takei will speak for 45 minutes, and 
then the ﬂ  oor will be open for student questions.
The Internet-famous 
actor was rated the No. 1 most inﬂ  uential person 
on Facebook in 2012 with more than 7.7 million likes, according to a press release.Stephanie Wong, president of the Asian 
American Student Union, said she wants students to feel empowered at the event.
“He is an advocate for the Asian-Amer-
ican community, and he’s been through a lot,” the 20-year-old UF political science junior said. “It’s great that these two mi-
nority communities are coming together to 
celebrate this event.”

Both local Jimmy John’s locations were involved in 
a franchise-wide data breach announced this week.
Customers who swiped debit or credit cards at ei-
ther the University Avenue or Archer Road location re-
cently are encouraged to monitor their bank accounts, according to a company release. Purchases made on-line or entered manually are not at risk.
The sandwich company suspects someone stole 
log-in credentials to access customers’ payment infor-mation, according to the release. About 216 stores were affected.
After learning of the breach on July 30, Jimmy 
John’s hired third-party forensic experts to help with 
the investigation, the release stated.
The breach has been contained, and customers can 
safely make in-store purchases on newly encrypted 
credit machines, according to the release. 
The chain is looking into its third-party vendor 
policies and offering identity protection services for customers who were affected. 
Stacy Mills, 21, said she had about $600 taken out of 
her account this week, but hadn’t conﬁ  rmed with her 
bank if it was related to the breach. 
The biology senior said she’s going to start using 
more cash for her purchases. 
“I deﬁ  nitely want to limit the number of times some-
one can steal my credit card information,” she said.Jimmy John’s

Pop-reggae meets rock tonight at 
High Dive, where Sidereal will take 
the stage for its seventh performance in Gainesville.
Lukas Costas, a 20-year-old UF 
marketing student and co-creator of the band, is excited for the band to play in Gainesville but is concerned about the state of Gainesville’s live-music culture.
“It’s hard to really get the word 
out about a show here solely be-cause there are so many things go-ing on here all the time,” he said. “But I would love to see Gainesville prove me wrong.” 
Venue doors open at 8 p.m., and 
both Hours Eastly and Currentz will open the show. Advance tickets are $8 then $10 at the door, located at 210 SW Second Ave.
Sidereal has shared stages with 
Passafire, The Dirty Heads and Less 
Than Jake, using instruments like 
ukuleles, saxophones and melodicas — wind instruments played like a piano — to combine different musi-cal elements into its sound. 
John Wilson, 20, said he’s seen 
the band in concert before.
“A lot of bands are selling out and just sound really poppy,” said Wilson, a UF industrial and systems engineering junior. But he looks forward to seeing Sidereal perform again.
“They just actually have good 
music.”Local band aims to revive live music
Charming Charlies accessories store will open next month
successful,” Lewis said. 
Elizabeth Bonet, assistant man-
ager of the Charlotte Russe in Oc-ala’s Paddock Mall, said the new Gainesville store will be successful 
because of the number of college 
girls in town. “We have a lot of customers over 
here coming from Gainesville to the Ocala location, so now they don’t have to travel all the way over here,” Bonet said. 
Bonet said women ages 13 and 
older shop in her store, and she said it is almost always busy. 
Charlotte Russe is not the only 
new women’s apparel store opening 
at Oaks Mall this semester — Hous-
ton-based Charming Charlie is set to open Oct. 27. The accessory retailer sells women’s jewelry, sunglasses, shoes and handbags and separates items by color throughout the store. The boutique has more than 200 lo-cations nationwide.
Sara Morrison, 22, said she isn’t 
looking forward to Charlotte Russe’s 
opening because she thinks its style 
is more suitable for younger girls. 
Morrison said she’s more excited 
for Charming Charlie.“I don’t think the mall has some-
thing like this,” Morrison said of Charming Charlie.
UF style guru Aleksandrea 
Djokoto, who blogs for College Fashionista, said she wants to go to 
the Charlotte Russe launch party. 
“I think it’s going to be successful 
because the Oaks Mall doesn’t have 
a lot of options,” she said.

UF Health is adding another 
hospital to its growing medical 
campus. 
The UF Health board ap-
proved funding for a new spe-
cialty hospital Wednesday that 
will hold neuromedicine and cardiovascular services. 
The $415 million construc-
tion project will be located on Archer Road just east of the UF Health Shands Cancer Hospital. The cost includes equipment and a parking garage with 600 
spaces. The building will have 
216 beds, including 120 special-ized ICU beds.
The idea for a new hospital 
stemmed from the long-term “Forward Together” plan pub-lished in May 2010, which de-scribes the alignment of clinical programs and facilities.
David Guzick, senior vice 
president for health affairs at UF and president of UF Health, said before “Forward Together,” services for particu-lar conditions were distributed throughout the hospital.
“The main hospital was sort 
of a checkerboard,” Guzick 
said. “The goal was to create an 
environment for our patients in which the people taking care of them were really focused on their needs and have special-ized expertise in that particular area.”
With the growing number of patients, UF Health CEO Ed-
ward Jimenez said building a 
new hospital was the next step.
“This new facility allows us 
to grow in a planned and orga-nized fashion” Jimenez said. 
One side of the building will 
house neuromedicine services, and the other cardiovascular.  
“You’re not going to find 
many hospitals in the country, when we’re done with this, that have lining facilities the way we have,” Jimenez said. 
Guzick said without this 
project, the building would get older and not provide the level of care Shands strives for.
“Both from the standpoint of 
providing the best care for our patients and from the stand-point of ensuring we can do that in the future by recruiting and retaining the best faculty, it really speaks to an exciting fu-ture,” Guzick said.
Construction is in the final 
permitting process to get the 
proper approval from the city 
and county, and it is set to be-gin around January 2015. The building is expected to be com-pleted at the end of 2017 and open at the start of 2018.
Guzick said the new build-
ing is in line with UF Rising because of the recruitment of 
preeminent faculty throughout 
the university.
“When you’re talking about 
the healthcare component, we’re talking about preeminent clinical programs that become nationally recognized,” Guzick said. “And it is right in step with the notion with UF Rising.” UF Health OKs plans

Gainesville Area National Organization for 
Women, a feminist organization, is hosting its 
first UF event in response to dozens of emails from students asking the group to move on campus.
Katy Burnett, NOW president and UF po-
litical science and history senior, said the po-litical organization focused on empowering female students is looking forward to reaching more students. 
“We’ve been getting emails from students 
for the past couple of months from people liv-
ing on campus,” the 31-year-old said. “There 
was a need to host events there. We spent a couple of weeks putting together interesting discussions and went for it.”
Gainesville Area NOW will host a women’s 
studies discussion series starting with campus safety on Oct. 8 at 4 p.m. in Ustler Hall.
The organization had an on-campus pres-
ence in the 1990s, but it disappeared after most 
of its members graduated, she said.
“Interest has brought the group back,” she 
said. “We were tabling, and there was just so much interest. We knew we had to work on 
something quick.”
A membership meeting will be held at 
Maude’s Classic Cafe on Oct. 4 at 2 p.m.
The group has reached out to on-campus 
organizations such as the Women’s Student Association, which will co-sponsor the Femi-nism and Women of Color event Oct. 15 at Us-
tler Hall at noon.
Diamond Delancy, association president and public relations junior, said planning has 
already begun to collaborate with NOW on the discussion series.
“Gainesville has such a rich feminist his-
tory,” the 19-year-old said. “I wish there was more off-campus involvement, but I’m glad we’re bringing it to the students.”
Delancy said feminist groups such as Wild 
Iris Books and the National Women’s Libera-tion chapter in Gainesville also tabled at Radi-cal Rush, hoping to provide more information to students on women’s empowerment.
“As a UF student, you’re not only invested 
in the UF campus, you’re also invested in the Gainesville community,” she said. Gainesville NOW to host events, meetings on campus

In the Spring of 2012, Alex Cor-
nillie, Jesse Schmitt and Carly Wil-
son teamed up for the Students Party executive ticket in the Student Government elections.
Cornillie, the Student Body presi-
dent candidate, was a UF Cicerone. Wilson, the candidate for Student Body treasurer, was the founder of the Students Party, a party created to rival the powerhouse Unite Party.
But wielding the most inﬂ  uence 
was Schmitt, a walk-on fullback for the Gators football team, who ran as 
the Student Body vice presidential 
candidate. It landed the Students Party an endorsement from Gators head football coach Will Muschamp — an unprecedented endorsement.
For the ﬁ  rst time, the minor-
ity party believed it had a ﬁ  ghting chance.
Come the ﬁ  nal election day, Feb. 
22, 2012, a total of 10,644 ballots had been cast  — the highest voter turn-out since 1983. Both parties marched to the outside of the Reitz Union’s Orange & Brew chanting party songs, energized, anxiously await-ing the results.
“As it got closer to the ﬁ  nal night, 
I thought we were gonna win,” Cor-
nillie said. 
The Unite Party erupted. Its exec-
utive ticket of Tj Villamil and Sabine 
Justilien narrowly escaped defeat by 114 votes; a margin of 1.07 percent. The Students Party walked away 
with 19 Student Senate seats versus 
Unite Party’s 31.
“It went from extreme excite-
ment to extreme disappointment,” said Ford Dwyer, then-Students Party president.The following Spring, the Unite 
Party folded. Instead, a new party emerged: the Swamp Party. With only 600 votes fewer than the pre-vious year’s high turnout, Swamp Party candidates Christina Bonar-rigo, the former Unite Party spokes-woman, and Joselyn Rivas won as 
Student Body president and vice 
president by a margin of 3,180 votes, or 31 percent. This time, Students Party suffered a more crushing de-feat, only winning 13 Senate seats.
Months later, in the Fall 2013 
elections, Students Party would only claim two Senate seats.
The decline of the Students Party 
was just beginning.
■   ■   ■
The Swamp Party is unopposed 
on the Fall 2014 ballot for the ﬁ  rst time in recent UF history.
The ideas and passion that once 
fueled the Students Party are gone. In fact, the party ceases to exist; it was not registered as a party for this 
semester’s SG elections, which begin 
Tuesday, according to UF Supervi-sor of Elections Hans Rojas.
That tight Spring 2012 election 
was the peak of the party, said Sen. Michael Christ, the sole minority party voice in the Senate.
“That was deﬁ  nitely the crescen-
do of the Students Party,” he said.  
“Students seemed to wake up and 
see that one-party rule is not condu-cive in government.”
Jenna Goldman, a former Stu-
dents Party president and 2013 Student Body vice presidential candidate, wanted to keep up the momentum the Students Party had gained in Spring of 2012 with the 
following Fall election, but it was 
difﬁ  cult. 
“After that election I think a lot 
of the people really lost faith,” she said.Goldman joined Wilson to create 
the Students Party in Fall 2011 after both senators disagreed with how 
the Unite Party ran SG.
“We founded it because we 
thought that what was going on in 
SG wasn’t in the best interest of the students,” Wilson said. Now a third-year UF law student, Wilson is no 
longer active in campus politics.
“I stopped having the time for 
SG, and it’s disappointing that there 
aren’t people who ﬁ  nd the time as undergraduates, but people make choices,” she said. “It’s very disap-pointing to me that there’s not an opposition to the majority.”
In the two-year span of 2012 to 
2014, Students Party membership dwindled. Dwyer said the cam-paign had 50 active volunteers with about 30 core members in 2012. By the end of 2014, past Students Party 
president Daniella Saetta said only 
15 members were active.
“It’s very difﬁ  cult to go into an 
election knowing that all the odds are stacked against you,” she said.
On top of members constantly 
rotating out of the party when they graduate, a losing party doesn’t at-tract new members, Christ said.
“When you’re not taking over SG 
because you’re not winning, there’s no real incentive for people to join a party where you have to work your tail off 24/7 to make marginal gains,” he said.
■   ■   ■
In two weeks, the Students Party will be a ghost in the Senate cham-bers, too.
After a yearlong run as Mur-
phree area senator, Christ won’t be the opposing voice in the chambers anymore. He’s decided to not run for re-election. He now lives off-campus in District A.
“I ran to represent the Murphree 
area,” he said. “I can’t really see my-self representing anyone else.”
He’s found solace serving as the 
vice chairman on the Reitz Union Board of Managers, a position where he says he can effect real change.
Christ said the Students Party 
won’t be back unless someone de-cides to engage again. 
“Being the last one is a sad state-
ment to democracy.”

Rosh Hashanah?Today’s question: Do you plan on going to see George 
Takei speak?Everyone’s needed for climate movement
This Sunday, more than 300,000 people descended on Times Square to bring awareness to the press-ing threat of climate change. This gathering was the 
largest climate demonstration in history. 
Protesters ﬂ  ooded Manhattan to draw attention to the is-
sue ahead of the United Nations Climate Summit. The march 
was endorsed by more than 1,100 organizations including nonproﬁ  ts, places of worship, politicians and local busi-nesses. The march included people of all ages, races, genders 
and backgrounds. Bert Garskof, an 81-year-old man who at-
tended the march, explained, “We’re going to lose our planet in the next generation if things continue this way.”
The ability of hundreds of thousands of people to as-
semble together is thrilling and inspiring and cemented the green movement as a legitimate civil rights movement. The slogan attached to this march was, “To change everything, we need everyone.” Unfortunately, some groups chose to exclude themselves from participation in this historic event. 
Speciﬁ  cally, many conservative lawmakers seem unwilling 
to touch the issue of climate change with a 10-foot pole.
Individual cities, companies and organizations can agree 
to start recycling in their ofﬁ  ces and acquire energy efﬁ  cient appliances. However, our local, state and federal govern-ments bear a signiﬁ  cant amount of responsibility for combat-ing climate change.
The president and Senate Democrats have supported a 
nationwide effort to reduce carbon emissions by gradually 
phasing out coal power plants. Republicans in Congress, 
who are projected to maintain control of the House of Rep-resentatives after the November elections, have completely ignored this critical issue.
Pointing out the failure of conservatives to respond mean-
ingfully to the climate issue is not intended to diminish the efforts of the protesters. March organizers kept their message broad and accommodating to all groups involved. What the march accomplished was to strengthen the resolve of Demo-
cratic lawmakers and left-leaning entities such as environ-
mental organizations, labor unions and feminist groups.
The good news is that Democrats can gain signiﬁ  cant 
progress on the city, county or state level, where they are more likely to reduce our nation’s carbon footprint. Some of the most signiﬁ  cant achievements at the lo-cal level have occurred in the areas of public transportation and the 
renovation of government build-
ings. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has already put forth a plan to reduce NYC’s carbon emissions by 80 percent and has called this 
action “a moral imperative.” This kind of ambitious leader-ship is sorely needed and long overdue.
Cities can also partner with universities to help deter-
mine which local short term actions will have the greatest 
effects on carbon emissions. UF has already begun this effort 
by studying climate change’s effects on Florida. Researchers throughout the southeast U.S. collaborated to identify water supply management and adaptation to rising sea levels as top priorities. Jim Jones, a UF professor in the agricultural and biological engineering department, said, “This type of thing needs to be packaged for regional and local use be-cause that is where decisions are made.”
The national climate movement will not move forward 
without serious input from conservatives on Capitol Hill. The debate on whether climate change exists is already set-tled. The discussion on this issue should focus on how much of a role government should have in implementing carbon restrictions.
If conservatives will not engage the issue of climate 
change, Democrats will simply have to wait for a demo-graphic shift in red rural areas or hope that Republicans ac-quiesce so a national climate agenda can progress. However, 
we cannot afford to wait; climate change is a problem that 
demands bold and immediate action.
If conservatives do eventually embrace the science of cli-
mate change, they should be welcomed into the environmen-tal movement with open arms. We all have a responsibility to care for planet Earth because it is really all we have.

It sometimes seems like the pundits on Fox News Chan-
nel are all in competition with one another to see who can make the most ignorant, offensive or just-plain-stupid state-ment. On Tuesday, Greg Gutfeld, one of the hosts of Fox News Channel’s “The Five,” may have set a new standard for idiocy during a conversation about climate change. When the discussion shifted to the topic of renewable and alternative energy sources, Gutfeld had this to say: “Isn’t fossil fuels the ultimate renewable energy? It’s renewed once. It used to be a dinosaur. Now it’s fuel. How is that not renewable?” Now, that’s a special kind of stupid.
Not to be outdone, one of Gutfeld’s co-hosts, Eric Bolling, 
decided to add his own misogynistic twist to a story about Mariam al-Mansouri, a female ﬁ  ghter pilot who led the Unit-ed Arab Emirates’ airstrikes against the terrorist Islamic State group. Rather than praising al-Mansouri, Bolling derisively referred to her military service as “boobs on the ground.” We implore Gutfeld and Bolling to at least try to think for a second or two before they speak, for all of our sakes. A pair of is-it-really-possible-to-be-that-dumb? DARTs go to Greg 
Gutfeld and Eric Bolling.
Maine Gov. Paul LePage has gained a reputation for being 
one of the most conservative governors in the U.S. Lepage has shown a particular disdain for the women of his state, cutting access to reproductive health care and slashing the budgets of vital social programs.” Given LePage’s history on women’s issues, it was a bit surprising to learn that he recently wrote a letter to Roger Goodell, commissioner of the NFL, and offered to create a coalition of governors to work on issues of domes-tic violence. In the letter, LePage wrote: “I grew up in a cycle of domestic violence, and I know how it tears apart families and communities.” It’s unlikely that the proposal represents a major shift in LePage’s general views on women, but it’s certainly a step in the right direction. A right-for-a-change 
LAUREL to Paul LePage.
LePage wasn’t the only Republican politician to make a 
strong and much-needed political statement this week. Rep. David Jolly, R-Fla., wrote a letter to the House Rules Commit-tee simply suggesting that Congress work more. Under Jol-ly’s proposal, any week that Congress is in session, members should work ﬁ  ve full days — Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. Jolly’s letter is an important reminder that members of Congress are largely failing to deal with the critical issues that Americans expect their elected representatives to ad-dress. Hopefully congressional leaders will take Jolly’s con-sideration seriously. If they do, who knows? Congress might actually get something done beyond naming post ofﬁ  ces and repealing “Obamacare” for the millionth time. We’re giving an at-least-you’re-trying LAUREL to Rep.

Swamp Party sets platform
Dear UF Students,
I am pleased to announce that Swamp 
Party has ofﬁ  cially set its Fall 2014 campaign 
platform. Our platform was derived from the expressed needs of the students and our candidates’ expertise. It is our belief that our 
platform accomplishes this student-encom-
passing ideal through its dynamic and com-prehensive nature.
This year’s platform generation was fo-
cused on making a better UF. It is a repre-
sentation of Swamp Party’s continuous hard work toward improving the lives of stu-
dents at UF. Based off the feedback from the 
student body, we have come up with three 
main focuses of our platform: Student Life, Academics, and Safety and Transportation. Each category was created to ensure we are 
able to meet the needs of students.
Student Government elections take place 
Tuesday and Wednesday. Our candidates 
and volunteers will be all over campus, in-
forming students about elections and edu-
cating them on our platform. We encourage 
all students who are interested in ﬁ  nding out more about our platform or have ques-tions to come ask a Swamp Party candidate 
or volunteer! A more comprehensive list of 
our platform is available at swamppartyuf.com.
As always, Go Gators!

It’s hard to talk about sex without 
mentioning sexuality. But for many people, sexuality is a deeply sensitive 
and personal topic.
I’ve previously avoided discussing 
sexuality in this column because, frankly, it’s not anybody’s business.
However, something happened this 
week to change my mind.
If you know me, you might know I’ve 
bounced around a lot with my sexual orientation — from straight to heteroﬂ  exible to queer to “I’m not go-ing to label myself as anything, and I’ll just take things as they come” — pun intended.
But there’s one term I haven’t felt comfortable 
using, even though it’s probably what describes my sexuality most accurately: bisexual.
This is a common sentiment among youth, accord-
ing to the Human Rights Campaign’s report “Sup-porting and Caring for Our Bisexual Youth.”
Bisexual Visibility Day, which was Tuesday, is try-
ing to ﬁ  x the stigma and invisibility around bisexual-ity.
Whenever bisexuality is discussed — which isn’t 
often — there are usually a lot of myths and stereo-types that surround it. This is why the marginaliza-tion of bisexuals, both within and outside of the LG-BTQ community, needs to be addressed.
According to the HRC’s report, bisexuality is the 
tendency to be “attracted to more than one sex, gen-der or gender identity.” Bisexuality isn’t the same as being gay, and bisexuals don’t necessarily face the same problems as their LGBTQ peers.
First of all, it’s hard to come out as bisexual. There 
are obviously signiﬁ  cant struggles involved for many of those who come out as gay or lesbian. However, the HRC report shows that fewer bisexual youth reported being out than their gay or lesbian counterparts, espe-cially to their families or at school.
When they do come out, common reactions are: 
“you’re just being selﬁ  sh,” “pick a side” or “it’s a phase.”
I’ve heard these comments directed at my friends 
before, and they have made me less conﬁ  dent about openly stating my sexual orientation.To dispel another myth: Yes, you can 
still be bisexual if you’re in an opposite-sex relationship. This fact really seems to confuse people, including CNN’s Larry 
King, who completely botched the sub-
ject of bisexuality in an interview with actress Anna Paquin.
Consider this metaphor: Many people 
like both chocolate and vanilla ice cream. 
Just because you’re eating chocolate right 
now doesn’t mean you suddenly don’t like vanilla 
anymore.
Sometimes — but not always — you’re even in the 
mood for a sundae with a bit of both ﬂ  avors.
Unfortunately, people are much more complicat-
ed than ice cream ﬂ  avors. If they weren’t, maybe we wouldn’t have such a problem with biphobia or bi-erasure.
If so, I wouldn’t hear girls say, “Well I’m totally 
straight, but, like, I really want to hook up with a girl.”
We wouldn’t call Piper Chapman from “Orange is 
the New Black” a lesbian who turned straight when she dated Larry, or a straight girl who turned gay 
when she hooked up with Alex.
Someone who is bisexual may not necessarily like 
both genders equally. A bisexual female can prefer 
having sex with ladies while still experiencing attrac-tion toward men. You can also be bisexual even if you’ve only had sexual experience with one gender.
It’s important for bisexual people, if they feel safe 
and comfortable doing so, to come out. It’s afﬁ  rming, and it shows others that it’s OK to come out too.
If we acknowledge that bisexuality is a real identity 
— not just indecision, or something done for attention — we’ll make it a little safer and more comfortable for people to identify as such.
So maybe it’s time for me to stop being scared of 
my own identity and own up to being bisexual. May-be that’ll encourage others to be true to themselves too.
And anyway, don’t they say two is better than 
one?

Just when we 
thought one national embar-
rassment was over with this week at 
Florida State University, we 
managed to create another. 
Tuesday’s Board of Trustees 
meeting, where the presiden-tial search advisory committee named John Thrasher as FSU’s next president, proved that stu-dent voice isn’t valued after all.
The people of FSU have 
spoken. They have made their voices loud and clear, opposing Thrasher from the beginning of the entire process after the long-time Republican senator was ﬁ  rst named a leading candidate for presidency. 
Nuclear physicists, doctoral 
students, graduate students, 
undergraduates, professors, 
faculty members and distin-guished members of academia at the university all had one common purpose: to have a say in the decision that could affect them most heavily; to prevent Thrasher from winning FSU’s presidency.
It was a clear and cohesive 
message. Don’t allow political dealings to affect university de-cisions. Stop letting corporate interests sway trustee members in their vote. 
Allow someone with a 
strong academic background to lead as president of FSU, 
not a politician who has served 
against the university’s inter-ests. Remember that this is an academic institution ﬁ  rst and foremost, after all, and not a business.
Their voices fell on deaf 
ears.
For more than two hours 
yesterday, an overwhelming majority of the opposition in the FSU community protested the appointment of Thrasher as FSU president. Yet instead of valuing the opinions of the public and heeding the word of the student and faculty body, the search committee chose 
to ignore them and pursue its 
own personal interests instead of what was best for the univer-sity. 
In a university poll, more 
than 70 percent said they be-lieved that Thrasher was not only a below-aver-age candidate, but that he was also blatantly unquali-ﬁ  ed to run FSU. As 
graduate student Joshua Mills pointed out, even the most un-scientiﬁ  c of polls are not off by 70 percent.
It feels paternalistic and of-
fensively patronizing of the Trustees, then, to imply that they know what is best for us. As if we don’t know what 
is best for ourselves, as if our 
voices are less valuable than theirs, as if we need to be spo-ken for by people who think they are more intelligent than us, who are brazen enough to assure brilliant members of academia that they know better than them. 
Their vote for Thrasher 
was a message saying, “You’re wrong. You don’t know what’s best for you, but I do.” Big Brother’s got this. 
The inconsistencies run ram-
pant. FSU, whose main goal is to become a top-25 public univer-sity in the coming years, chose 
to hire a non-academic as its 
president when over 20 percent of the decision to be in the top 25 percent comes from a uni-versity’s reputation and when the current top-25 universities only have one school whose president is a non-academic. 
It’s astonishing that the com-
mittee that wants to drive us to top-25 status appointed a non academic, knowing it will dras-tically tarnish our reputation and come back to bite us.
Most of us will never truly 
know why John Thrasher was deemed more worthy of presi-dency than Michele G. Wheat-
ley, Richard Marchase, Michael 
Martin or our interim presi-dent, Garnett Stokes. But it has become increasingly clear that there is something else going on. Though I don’t know what it is, there is a reason the com-mittee chose Thrasher as the president of FSU. 
Whether or not that reason 
is in our best interest, we’ll ﬁ  nd out.

A local magazine staff is reach-
ing out to readers after an 86-percent 
budget cut last month, jeopardized its future.
The Fine Print, a student-run 
social advocacy publication based in Gainesville, is struggling to stay in print after its largest benefactor, Generation Progress, drastically cut the $5,000 grant it annually provides the magazine to $700.
“I wake up to this email that says 
your grant results are in, and it starts with an apology,” said Samantha 
Schuyler, an editor at The Fine Print. 
“And I was like, ‘This isn’t good.’”
Generation Progress, a nonprofit 
that supports student activists and journalists, made the $4,300 reduc-tion about a week before The Fine Print’s staff planned on starting the newest issue, each of which typi-cally costs about $1,100.
“With what they were giving us, 
we wouldn’t have been able to print one issue,” Schuyler said.Funds were reduced due to bud-
get cuts within Generation Progress, and although The Fine Print still 
received one of the higher grants 
available, it wasn’t enough to con-tinue printing magazines, Schuyler said.
To make up for the loss, editors 
at The Fine Print decided to start up a crowdfunding campaign on Indi-egogo, an online donation website 
similar to Kickstarter. 
The fundraiser, Keep The Fine 
Print in Print, has generated, as of 
press time, $3,355 of its $4,300 goal.
In addition to the online cam-
paign, the magazine hosted a gallery of student art two weeks ago and raised more than $650 by charging an entrance fee of $5.
The response has been encourag-ing, said Damian Gonzalez, an edi-tor at The Fine Print.
“It’s amazing,” Gonzalez said. 
“It’s really reassuring to know that there is a community of people here in Gainesville that actually care about The Fine Print, care about Gainesville and care about Alachua enough to keep The Fine Print in print.”
While The Fine Print does pub-
lish online content, Gonzalez said 
the staff stands by the importance 
of keeping the magazine available in print. 
“What’s really important is that 
people in Gainesville have some-thing tangible to access,” he said, “something that they can pick up when they’re walking to class, some-thing they can pick up when they’re 
walking to work … and just read,” 
he said. 
The campaign ends in less than 
two weeks.

UF researchers found a re-
cord number of crocodile hatch-
lings this year in South Florida. 
Over the summer, UF’s 
Croc Doc team of biologists in 
Fort Lauderdale marked and 
released crocodile eggs in Ever-glades National Park. 
The Croc Doc team marked 
and released 962 hatchlings in the park, up from last year’s 554, according to a UF press release. 
Jeff Beauchamp, UF wildlife 
biologist and the alligator and crocodile project manager, said the increase in egg survival is the result of continued restora-tion efforts in the Everglades.
Since the early 2000s, there 
has been a steady increase in crocodile population numbers. While hatchling numbers are 
a good sign, their survival rate 
is usually only about 5 percent, Beauchamp said. 
Franklin Percival, a UF asso-
ciate professor who studies rep-tiles, said crocodiles are used as an indicator for restoration ef-forts because they live in both brackish and salt water.
“It’s a good sign when one-
year surveys turn out like that,” he said. “It gives hope and indi-cates a good future.”
Beauchamp said that even 
though numbers were up this year, there is no way to guess the number of hatchlings next year. Crocodile hatchling 
numbers increaseFRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

During a week meant to 
raise awareness about bisexu-
ality, Gainesville stood quiet.
Bisexuality Awareness 
Week runs through this week-end, and despite national social media trends to spread aware-ness, UF’s LGBT Student Af-fairs Ofﬁ  ce, UF’s Pride Student Union and the Pride Commu-nity Center of North Central Florida did not plan events. 
“I don’t think that our 
country even has a full under-standing of what bisexuality entails,” said Aaron Victoria, head teaching assistant for UF human sexuality and culture, 
“so I think awareness and pro-
grams that promote them and bring that to light could beneﬁ  t just by educating individuals who aren’t bisexual.”
More than half of all LGBT 
people are bisexual, according to a report released Monday in conjunction with the Bisexual Resource Center.
The report emphasized the 
importance of reaching out to bisexual people.
Pride Student Union Presi-
dent Collin Vernay wrote in an email he was planning Pride History Week — which runs from Oct. 6 to 10 — and could not respond.
LGBT Affairs Student Am-bassador and 20-year-old UF 
international studies junior 
Carolyn Cesarotti said it takes months to plan events like a 
Bisexual Awareness campaign 
— time they simply didn’t 
have, she said.
“Our ofﬁ  ce did a lunch se-
ries where we had panelists 
speak, and as an ofﬁ  ce, we try 
to serve the whole LGBT spec-
trum,” said Cesarotti. “And I 
think that’s an issue as far as bisexual and pansexual vis-
ibility, but a lot goes into pro-
graming for different events in 
the ofﬁ  ces ahead of time.”
Bisexual people are more 
likely to be poor, feel alienated 
in workplaces, be involved in 
violent relationships and have 
health complications than les-
bians, gay people or homo-
sexuals are, according to the 
report.
“If you don’t come out and 
you aren’t completely comfort-able with your sexuality, other studies have shown that con-taining this really weighs on you and has long term health effects mentally,” Victoria said.
Laura Yudiski, a 19-year-
old UF accounting freshman, said she’s not involved in the LGBT community and has lim-ited means of ﬁ  nding more in-formation.
“I think people could learn 
more about it,” said Yudiski. “It’s not really something that you constantly hear about. You hear more about homosexuals instead of bi.”Gainesville lacked

UF group GatoRaas will take its 
traditional Indian dance moves to 
Jacksonville today for the third an-nual Night of Asia festival.
GatoRaas, an ofﬁ  cial dance team 
that performs the Indian dance Raas, has been competing on a national level since 2006. This is the ﬁ  rst time it will go to the Jacksonville festival.
Although Raas retains its reli-
gious value, the dance has become a way for Indian people to express their culture, said GatorRaas team captain Devarshi Desai, 21.
The dance includes men and 
women adorned in brightly colored outﬁ  ts and holding painted bamboo sticks called dandiya as their main dance prop. The dance steps are fast-paced and synchronized, requiring the dancers to constantly move and twirl their dandiya.
Desai, a UF biology senior, has 
been working to prepare her team for the performance, which will be 
the last act at the festival. She has 
participated in more than 20 perfor-mances since joining the team.
“Raas is my happy place,” Desai 
said. “I love to instill the same pas-
sion I have for Raas into my team-
mates, and that’s the best part about being captain.”GatoRaas placed ﬁ  rst in Tampa 
Fest and Diwali Dhamaka, both in-state competitions.
Manali Patel, a 20-year-old ap-
plied physiology and kinesiology senior, joined the team about three 
weeks ago. She said the festival in 
Jacksonville will be her ﬁ  rst perfor-mance in front of a large audience.
“Everyone has been so welcom-
ing since I ﬁ  rst joined the team. It feels like I am dancing with my 
family rather than a dance team for 
school,” Patel said.
Richard Rose, dance associate 
professor, said the hypnotic dance 
conveys messages to the audience. 
“This kind of dance challenges 
us from a different perspective,” Rose said. “Modern dances tell us the story of humans, but Raas tells us the story of superhumans.”GatoRaas dance team to performUF GROUPS

Closing the door to one of the toughest 
preconference schedules in Florida history, 
the Gators head to Alabama to face their first Southeastern Conference opponent, Auburn, 
tonight at 8.
No. 10 Florida (6-3) is coming off a big win 
after beating Central Florida (7-5) on Sunday in four sets. 
While UCF is unranked, coach Mary Wise 
has highlighted the difficulty of the Knights’ 
schedule, which was key in making it such a big win for the Gators.
“They were playing at a perfect level of vol-
leyball,” Wise said on Sunday after UF’s 3-1 
win over UCF. “We felt that even as well as 
they were playing, we were awfully close to winning that (first) set. We stayed the course and didn’t panic. If they could sustain that they would win the match. … They were pret-ty ultra human in that first set.”
But even with a win against UCF, it means 
nothing in conference play.
Wise has changed the mentality of her team 
this season. Instead of focusing on the losses in a negative light, Florida is using it to practice and learn from its mistakes.
With the losses being used as a learning 
tool, having a 6-3 record doesn’t phase the team.

Florida celebrates a point during its 3-0 win against Georgia Southern on Aug. 29 in the O’Connell Center. The Gators open their Southeastern Conference schedule tonight at 8 after finishing non-conference play with a 6-3 record.
Well, our first bye week is 
here.
And for us here at the al-
ligatorSports Brand Picks Column, that means we have a little bit of a break from the humdrum of our lives that revolve around live-tweeting football 
press conferences.
There was no #MuschampMonday, 
no #StoryTimeWithRoper, no D.J Dur-
kin (we have yet to find an appropriate hashtag for the defensive coordinator’s 
Wednesday-afternoon pressers; sug-
gestions are always welcome).
But with all that said, take this 
weekend to enjoy yourself, Gator fans. You need it after last week.
Now onto the picks!
Returning to form and making it 
back to first place at 18-12 is the Orlan-
do Sentinel’s Edgar “shank-apotomus” Thompson. Went golfing with the main man from the Orlando Sentinel over 
the weekend. I enjoyed the lesson in 
cart etiquette, and the pointers on the putting stroke. One day we’ll find that drive you hit on the back-nine, maybe it’s out on 34th street.
Falling one spot to second place 
with his 17-13 record is alligatorSports writer Jonathan “I’m a redneck” Czu-pryn, who wore a Harley-Davidson T-shirt, light-wash dad jeans and Sper-
rys to volleyball media availability. Of 
course AlligatorSports assistant editor Eden Otero called you out, you looked like Tuscaloosa really agreed with 
you.
In third with a 16-14 record is Inside 
the Gators’ Landon “road quest quiz-
taker” Watnick. Look Landon, I know 
school comes first, but could you really 
not have gotten that quiz done before hitting the road to come back from Tuscaloosa? Must have been mighty-
awkward to ask Nick to pull over in Picks

For Florida fans, beating 
Georgia is a big deal. 
And although the Gators football team does not play the 
Bulldogs until Nov. 1 in Jack-
sonville, the other Florida fut-
bol team will take to the 
pitch against 
Georgia to-
night at 7 at James G. Pressly Stadium.
In soccer, the Gators are 25-2-1 all-time against the Bull-
dogs, including a 5-1 win in 
Athens, Ga., last season. UGA also has never defeated UF in Gainesville, something that 
gives the No. 7 Gators an edge 
as the home team this evening.
But Florida (6-2, 1-0 South-
eastern Conference) knows getting the victory will not be easy.
The Bulldogs (6-1-1, 1-0-1 
SEC) enter the game ranked No. 22 in the country while riding a five-game winning 
streak, which was kept alive 
after a come-from-behind vic-tory against Vanderbilt Sunday. During the streak, Georgia has Florida returns home to play Georgia

UF Socceroutscored its opponents 14-2 and 
has scored first in every game except its win against Vanderbilt, meaning 
starting slow is not an option for the 
Gators.
But the players and coaches said 
they feel confident that the difficult 
early season road trip – which in-
cluded visits to Tallahassee against then-No. 2 Florida State and Palo Alto, Calif., against then-No. 4 Stan-ford – has prepared them to take 
on any challenge the Bulldogs may 
throw at them.
“We just saw so many different 
things,” coach Becky Burleigh said. 
“We saw different types of teams, 
the styles of play, playing in differ-ent parts of the country – all those things just add to the experience that we have to start the season.”
For junior defensive back Claire 
Falknor, one of Florida’s most expe-rienced players as well as an anchor on the back line, the return home came at the right time.
“It’s definitely hard to travel, 
when you’ve got a lot of adversity thrown at you,” Falknor said. “But I think from the losses and wins, 
we’ve taken something out of each 
game.”
Falknor and the rest of the back 
line will be tasked with shutting down Georgia’s impressive sopho-
mores, which includes leading scor-
ers Marion Crowder and Gabby Seiler. Each has five goals on the season, and Seiler has seven assists 
as well.
Georgia also has five freshmen on 
its roster who play for their respec-tive youth national teams.
But for Florida, to be the best, 
you have to beat the best.
“We always say, when we play 
against a team, we always want them 
to bring their best, because it brings 
out the best in us,” said Liz Slattery, 
a sophomore midfielder who scored her first goal of the season in Flor-ida’s last game against Alabama.  
“And so when we beat them, it feels 
that much better to know that we beat them at their best.”
Florida hosts Missouri on Sun-
day afternoon, which is coming off 
its own four-game winning streak. 
But Slattery said she hopes only one team leaves this weekend on a hot streak.
“We’re hoping to keep going on 
that roll,” Slattery said. “And maybe end theirs.”
And with SEC play beginning, Florida will be look-
ing at it as a clean slate, and in Wise’s mind, a whole 
different season.
“We’re approaching this part as what we call the 
second season,” Wise said. “There’s the preconference, which is season No. 1, conference is season No. 2 and postseason is season No. 3. So now we have more time 
to improve as a team as we go from the end of Septem-
ber to the end of November.”
Florida will be hard-pressed in its first conference 
match of the season. 
Unlike Florida’s preconference schedule, the Gators 
will be facing a familiar team that, like every other SEC school, will be determined to get a win against the 
Gators.
“Everybody hates the Gators,” Wise said. “We used 
to say that we were a band team. A band might not play 
every home match, but they’ll play when the Gators are there.”
But with Mackenzie Dagostino — the player Wise 
said is most improved — Holly Pole and a strong out-
side hitter and middle blocker squad, Florida looks to 
capitalize on a young Auburn team, which holds six freshmen on a 12-player roster.
Florida’s biggest threat going into Auburn is fresh-
man outside hitter Courtney Crable, who leads the Ti-
gers in kills (2.78 per set, 136 total through 13 games), 
service aces (15) and dig attempts (17).
In comparison, Florida’s outside hitter Alex Hol-
ston leads the team in kills with 116 with a .319 hitting percentage, while 6-foot-4 freshman middle blocker 
Rhamat Alhassan leads Florida with a .510 hitting profi-
ciency and 46 total blocks.
The Tigers boast an 8-5 record, but are 5-1 when com-
peting at home, but Dagostino said facing Auburn will 
be no different from Florida’s nonconference schedule.
“Volleyball is volleyball,” Dagostino said. “No mat-
ter what conference we’re in, no matter what team we’re playing. It’s just really important that we remember that 
it’s volleyball. We have to play the same as we would 
play against a Final Four team as we would maybe a 
team that wouldn’t make it to the Final Four. It’s just 
making sure we’re doing the same thing and competing 
the same way as we do on the practice court.”Alhassan leads 
the Gators with a .510 hitting clip

And now, somehow, we have a 
freaking FIVE-WAY TIE for dead-ass last this week, all sporting a 
piss-poor record of 14-16.
First is alligatorSports editor Jor-
dan “Just keep throwing my pitch-
es” McPherson, who talked with the 
Alabama student newspaper sports 
editor in the Bryant-Denny Stadium press box about softball for what seemed like an eternity. Really, 
man? Hopefully it was better than 
your average interview with Han-nah Rogers. But in this case, your defense (read: your fellow football writers) will not have your back.
Next up is alligatorSports.org Editor Richard “#FreeOJ” Johnson, who tweeted out that hashtag with-out context when referring to Ala-bama tight end OJ Howard, who had not caught a pass all season 
prior to facing the Gators. Or was 
he? I guess we’ll never know.
Third is alligatorSports writer 
Morgan “Booster Seat” Moriarty, who has to sit on a cushion in order to see above the wheel when she drives. And on top of that, whe had no problem driving close to 90 miles 
per hour on the way to Alabama. 
Were you trying to kill us, Morgan?
Fourth is Gator Country’s  Nick 
“Girl you got the beat right, killin’ in your Levis” de la Torre, who played “American Kids” by Kenny Chesney and “Leave the Night On” by Sam Hunt at least 20 times each 
on the car rides to and from Tusca-
loosa last weekend. Nick, we un-derstand you enjoy making out on living room couches and blowing that smoke on a Saturday night, but Jesus Christ. And finally is 247sports.com’s 
Thomas “I’m not the only one who sucks at the Picks Column” Gold-kamp, who has been in dead-ass-last since the first round of picks this season. While you may not be at the bottom of the Picks Column totem pole by yourself anymore, Goldkamp, you’re still in dead-ass-last.FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

An indication of a team 
that is progressively getting 
better is overcoming disap-
pointment and adversity. 
And it’s happening with 
the Florida men’s golf team 
so far through the fall.
After finishing second-to-
last in their first tournament, the Gators bounced back and came in second place at the Wolf Run Intercollegiate. 
And while coach J.C. Dea-
con is happy with Florida’s improvement, he feels the team has to get better so they 
can compete with the top 
teams in the country.
“We still got beat by 30 
by Illinois, so that’s where my mind is at is trying to be 
one of the best teams in the 
country,” Deacon said. “We have the players to do it I re-ally believe that we just need 
to get our expectations back 
to competing at the highest level.”
Illinois went into the tour-
nament as the No. 2 team in 
the country and had the only 
two players in the field to finish under-par. 
The Fighting Illini are 
now the new No. 1 team in the country with a record of 28-0. 
Florida will have to keep 
progressing throughout the 
fall, if they want to be ready 
for the Southeastern Confer-ence and the NCAA’s.UF had two new players 
in its lineup in Zionsville. One of them being freshman Ryan Celano and the other, 
senior Eric Banks. 
Banks was an important member to the team last sea-
son, as he competed in all but one tournament and col-lected four top-20 finishes. 
Banks finished at 10-over-
par and was the third best player over the weekend for the Gators by ending the tournament in a tie for 13th place — his highest finish 
since tying for 13th at the 
Old Waverly Collegiate on April 8. 
Deacon said Banks’ ex-
perience is invaluable to the 
team.  
“Eric brings a great ele-
ment to the team, he’s got a 
little bit of fire in him, he’s 
very competitive,” Deacon 
said. “He wants to be great and he’s been around, he has experience and I really noticed it. It was a pleasure 
to have him on the road and 
his scores helped us all three rounds.”
The Gators will now have 
a few weeks off before head-ing to Orlando for the three-day Tavistock Collegiate In-vitational. 
Having a good week of 
practice and playing well in qualifying will be key for Florida before heading into its third tournament of the 
year.
“I think we just need to go 
and compete in qualifying 
and the guys are out there practicing a lot and play-
ing a lot,” Deacon said. “I’m 
starting to see where I need to work with the guys, so that really helps me, because 
when you watch them in 
tournaments it’s a different story, you see some different 
things, so watching that I’m 
able to kind of pick the parts of their games that I want to improve.”16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 2014

The men’s tennis team will be back on the 
court in the ITA Saint Francis Health Sys-
tem Men’s All-American Championships pre-qualifying tournament this weekend in Tulsa, Okla. 
Sophomores Elliot Orkin and Maxx Lip-
man are both ranked in the NCAA Division I singles rankings — Orkin No. 39 and Lip-man No. 100.
Orkin’s second year on the team has al-
ready begun with tremendous success as of Monday. The Georgia native won the singles title at the Southeastern Conference Fall Clas-sic after defeating teammate Diego Hidalgo 
in straight sets, 6-3, 7-6 (7).
“Physically, he’s changed probably more 
than any guy on our team,” coach Bryan 
Shelton said. “When you look at the boy that he was when he arrived and the man that he is now, he looks like two totally different people. ... He may not be the biggest guy in the world, but he’s the toughest little son of a gun you’ve ever seen.”
With two tournaments already under its 
belt, Florida knows it still has room to im-prove as the Fall season progresses.
“It’s the first couple of weeks, so every-
thing needs to be tightened up a little bit,” junior Gordon Watson said.
The ITA All-Americans are one of three 
fall events in place for Division I players - ITA regionals and the ITA National Indoor Championships are the other two events. The ITA championship is one of the top tour-naments Florida will compete in this fall. The 
qualifying events will be held Saturday, and 
the regional draw will be held Oct. 16-19.Gators to play
