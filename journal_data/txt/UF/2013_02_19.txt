Kayla Sundean talks to her mom on the phone at least three 
times a day . She sees her parents at least once a month because her 
home is two hours away.
In high school, the 18-year-old UF applied physiology and ki-
nesiology and health education and behavior freshman, said her 
parents were over-controlling “helicopter” parents. 
A new study revealed over-controlling parents are negatively 
impacting their college student’s ability to feel independent and 
competent. The study , from the University of Mary Washington, showed some students are more than frustrated by their helicopter parents — they’re depressed and dissatisﬁ  ed with their lives.
Victor Harris, a UF assistant professor in the department of fam-
ily youth and community sciences, said helicopter parents tend to be dominating and overprotective.
“It’s a really ﬁ  ne line to try and balance between how much to 
try and help the child and how much not to,” he said. “If a child feels like the parent is too much involved, it’s the child’s responsi-bility to say so.”

Sen. Bill Nelson came to UF on Monday 
for part of his fact-checking tour as chair-
man of the Senate’s Special Committee on 
Aging.
Nelson toured UF’s Aging and Rehabili-
tation Research Center, where he met with 
UF experts for a Q-and-A session.Marco Pahor, director of the Institute 
on Aging, informed Nelson of the major research being done, speciﬁ  cally on how a 
sedentary life and obesity can be counter-
acted to give senior citizens a higher qual-
ity of life.
Pahor said UF’s studies on indepen-
dence and mobility in the elderly should be completed by the end of the year. He said increasing mobility is a key factor in giving a higher quality of life to seniors.
“People who lose mobility have a 40 per-
cent higher health care cost,” Pahor said.
Pahor and Nelson 
agreed Florida was an ideal place to be conduct-ing this project.
“We all know Florida 
is a booming place for se-
niors,” Pahor said.
Nelson is the third 
senator from Florida to 
become chair of the Special Committee on Aging. He said his major goals are to enact Medicare reform and end Medicare fraud.
“Tens of billions of dollars are lost to 
taxpayers from Medicare fraud,” he said.
Nelson will continue his tour in Talla-
hassee, where he will visit the Claude Pep-per Center.
He said as he continues his tour of 
Florida, he feels optimistic, as he sees the changes being made from the new health 
care law he voted in two and a half years 
ago.

◗ ABOUT 3,600 POUNDS WERE COLLECTED.
ALEX HARRIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Thousands of attendees at Auto-Plus Raceway’s sec-
ond annual “Will Race for Food” event this weekend 
helped raise about 3,600 pounds of food for needy fami-lies.
“Between paid spectators and those who came for 
free through the food drive, we did around 7,500 specta-tors on the weekend,” said Track Manager Rich Schaefer. “We were happy with that.”
Attendees had the option of either buying a ticket for 
$15 or donating a minimum of 15 nonperishable food items in return for a free ticket.
Marcia Conwell, a Bread of the Mighty representa-
tive, said this weekend’s haul was a 2,000-pound increase from last year’s collection. 
The event featured 450 racers in 13 classes of competi-
tion, as drivers attempted to qualify for larger, national races.
Nate Cross, sales and marketing manager for the 
track, said the inspiration for the food drive was a “60 Minutes” special on hungry families in Florida. Auto-Plus Raceway partnered with Bread for the Mighty to collect food for those in need.
“It’s sort of a win-win for us as a racetrack because we 
get to make a food donation to the food bank, and we get a few more people out to the race track,” Cross said.Races collects tons

There’s a way to prevent late-night drunk posts and 
profanity-filled tweets from getting in the way of a job.
NetClarify is a new startup company run out of the 
Innovation Hub that screens online content in order to 
identify information that could raise red flags to employ-
ers. It also provides the user with the tools to remove the 
problematic content.
“There are a lot of different numbers out there, but one 
of the more consistent ones I’ve seen is that about 92 per -
cent of employers will screen candidates on social media sites,” said Jill Skufe, Career Development Coordinator at UF’s Career Resource Center.
To analyze a user’s presence on the Web, the software uses a word bank of 17,000 words to identify potentially 
offensive material and to determine the overall attitude of 
a person’s posts, said NetClarify CEO Adam Gross. These include “LMAO,” “sexy” and “beer.”
UF anthropology senior Mario Figueredo, 21, used 
NetClarify to clean his Facebook.
The service authenticated Figueredo’s identity by ask-
ing him to log in and then scanned elements like status updates, events and groups. The free Sample Report screened the last 50 posts. Figueredo had 52 red flags on 
words he used and was rated as a 75 percent positive per -
son.
According to the website, a more extensive Gold Re-
port, which costs $14.95, includes other sites like Twitter. 
“It made me realize what I’m posting and how I can be 
seen by someone looking at my profile,” Figueredo said.NetClarify helps manage online reputationBEATRICE DUPUY

The Florida Department of Health 
and UF have partnered to create a vir -
tual food safety center. 
The Food Safety Center of Excel-
lence is one of five national centers 
working with public health agencies, 
according to a College of Public Health and Health Professions press release.
Each of the national centers has a 
partnership with a university and a state department of health.
Carina Blackmore, a Florida Depart-
ment of Health state epidemiologist, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention awarded UF and the 
state health department a $200,000 
grant for the virtual 
center. 
The national 
centers were es-tablished with the signing of the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration Food Safety 
Modernization Act. 
The act calls for 
state and local participation to prevent foodborne illness outbreaks.
Michael Batz, head of food safety programs at UF’s Emerging Pathogens Institute, said the UF component of the 
center will include training, outreach 
and research.
UF’s Emerging Pathogens Institute 
and the Institute of Food and Agricul-tural Sciences will be working with the center.
Blackmore said in the future, there 
will be opportunities to learn more and become better at detecting outbreaks.
“In Florida, we have over 6,000 hu-
man cases of salmonella each year,” she said.  “Many of the cases we inves-tigate, we never find out exactly how they were infected.”UF receives grant for virtual food center

◗ MIXERS CAN MASK THE 
EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL.
ALEX HARRIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
A sobering new study shows 
mixing diet soda with alcohol 
can lead to getting more drunk than when using regular soda.
The study, authored by a psy-
chology professor at Northern Kentucky University , reflects an experiment conducted by Dennis Thombs, a former associate pro-fessor in UF’s College of Public Health and Health Professions.
His 2010 study consisted of 
interviews and Breathalyzer tests gathered from Midtown patrons.
Thombs said he wanted to 
find out if there was a difference between the blood alcohol levels of people who drank alcohol with diet soda versus regular mixers.
He said diet soda ingredients 
don’t play a role in alcohol ab-sorption.
“There’s nothing intrinsic in 
aspartame, the artificial sweeten-er, that spikes people’s blood al-cohol levels,” Thombs said. “It’s just the absence of sugar allows the alcohol to be absorbed as it normally would be.”
Thombs said he found mixer 
choices have little effect on peo-ple’s BAC.
“The differences aren’t enor -
mous, but they’re detectable,” he said. “There could be impor -tant implications there because it could put you over the legal limit for driving.”
Thombs said he thinks stu-
dents should be aware their al-cohol limit may not be the same 
when they use different mixers.
The impact on people’s BAC 
may not always be physically 
felt, especially when caffeine, sugar and alcohol are combined.
Director of Gatorwell Mau-
reen  Miller said mixers can mask effects of alcohol until it’s too late.
“A lot of times when people 
are drinking, physically they feel OK, but in reality , their BAC is probably over the legal limit,” she said.
Thombs said women espe-
cially are more likely to use a diet mixer because they’re more con-scious about weight than men.
Nigel Smith, professor of ge-
ography at UF, teaches a class about alcohol’s social and cul-tural aspects. He said although the studies aren’t breaking news, students should be aware of what they’re drinking.
“What’s new is the sheer vol-
ume of consumption of it, espe-
cially these concentrated sodas 
with lots of caffeine in them,” he said.
But students like Marc An-
derson, a 21-year-old UF music junior, seem to think differently.
“Honestly, unless you’re try-
ing to get drunk, it shouldn’t af-fect you at all,” he said.Diet soda mixers get

A team of UF students won big 
last week for a sausage with a Flor -
ida twist.
On Feb. 11, five students were 
awarded first place at the Uni-
versity Student Cook-off during 
MEATXPO’13, a meat industry ex-position in Las V egas. Their entry , an orange-infused sausage dubbed the Sunshine Citrus Sausage, beat out eight other universities.
“We had a unique product,” 
said Brittany McDaniel, a 21-year-old UF agricultural education and 
communication junior.
McDaniel joined Tahlia Pollitt, 
Victoria V elinsky , Katelyn Malin 
and Matthew Love — all animal science undergraduates — at the event. The students, who were se-lected based on their experience and school performance, worked together to plan, produce and pres-
ent their sausage.
Sally Williams, an associate 
professor of animal sciences and adviser to the students, said the group devised the idea for an or -
ange-flavored sausage early in the 
planning process.
“You want a product that stands 
out,” she said. “If you’re from Flori-da, relate it to Florida.”
The team produced its first pro-
totype in November and eventual-ly went through six batches before creating the final product.  
Although they originally had 
planned two versions of the sau-sage, one smoked and one fresh, the students decided to focus on the smoked version for its superior flavor, Williams said.
For the final product, the stu-
dents produced 50 pounds of sau-sage using campus equipment.  
During the event, the sausage was 
cooked on-site and served with the other entries in a buffet-style lunch.
“I was hopeful, but I wasn’t cer -
tain about a win because the com-petition looked good,” said Love, a 20-year-old UF animal science sophomore.
The group was awarded the top 
prize by a panel of four judges, all of whom were professionals in the industry.
MEATXPO is hosted by the 
North American Meat Association, a trade group of about 700 compa-nies in the meat industry.
For Williams, although winning 
the competition was satisfying, the real meaning of the event was al-lowing students to get experience with the industry.
“This event is important because 
it allows the students to enhance their professional development and networking,” she said. “Some of the folks here might be their fu-
ture employers.” UF students win big for their sausage

Yolandy Michel stopped on the 
Plaza of the Americas on Monday to 
play chess with a master and strike up a conversation about creationism.
Michel, a 20-year-old UF telecom-
munication sophomore, is a member of SOMA, UF’s college and young adult ministry. The organization host-ed Jonathan Sarfati, a creationist, pub-lished author and chess master.
Members of SOMA set up 10 tables 
with three chess boards each in a circle so Sarfati could play up to 30 people simultaneously. Always as the white 
pieces, he would go around the circle 
and the opponents would make their moves.
Rob Sullivan, the pastor at Cal-
vary Chapel Gainesville, which heads SOMA, said he wanted to bring a cre-ationist on campus for the organiza-
tion’s first big event. He said the chess 
circle was a way to attract people and engage conversation about creation-ism.
Michel said Sarfati answered a lot 
of her questions about creationism.“Sometimes I find myself not being 
able to defend my faith when evolu-tion was thrown in my face,” she said. “I feel so much more confident now.”
Sarfati is one of the speakers in 
Creation Ministries International. He said he usually doesn’t visit universi-
ties because the ministries’ main focus 
is to speak at churches. But Sarfati said there’s a lot of misinformation about creationism that students should be aware of.
“I’m hoping to present something 
positive as well,” he said.
Sarfati also presented his speaker 
series titled “Design, Deluge and Di-
lemma” to about 100 people at the 
Reitz Union Grand Ballroom. After the session, he took questions from the audience. Sarfati used examples like the Grand Canyon and fossils to refute the idea of evolution. He ex-plained how operational science has roots in the bible.
“We have the right to investigate 
the creation,“ he said.

UF sees mostly students’ moms hovering
The study was based on an online survey of 297 U.S 
undergraduate students. In the survey, students were 
asked to describe their mothers’ parenting behavior.
Beverly Brady , a licensed psychologist at the UF 
Counseling and Wellness Center, said the center has 
students who come in complaining their moms won’t 
stop checking up on them.
“We have students who complain that their parents 
text several times a day, and the parents expect the stu-dents to respond immediately,” Brady said.
She said the center receives calls from concerned 
parents at the beginning of every Fall semester — mostly from freshmen parents. 
Plus, parents now text, Skype and Facebook mes-sage kids. Harris said the technology has made parents feel the need to intervene more.
“As students try and gain more independence, par -
ents need to back off and have a free, open and con-
gruent communication about the process,” he said.
Harris also said when the market 
is more competitive, parents want to express that expectation.
Before college, Sundean said, she 
didn’t know what it was like to be independent. She now pays for tu-ition, gas, food and housing.
“When I’m here they let me ex-
perience college,” she said. “Now they call me to make sure I’m OK and if I need help, they help.”heliCoPteR , from page 1“This event is important

The cups, which cost $1, have 
been around since early January 
but have just recently come to UF.
People can save 10 cents on 
their beverage when they bring 
their own reusable cup, mug or 
travel tumbler, according to Star -
bucks’ website.
In the Reitz Union Starbucks, 
people get 25 cents off a bever -
age purchase when they bring a 
reusable cup purchased from the company.
“It really appealed to my fru-
gal side,” said Myers, a 20-year-
old UF finance and criminology 
sophomore.
Myers said she has been get-
ting into sustainability lately and 
raising her environmental aware-
ness, so she decided to buy some-thing reusable.
She has had the cup for a few 
weeks now and has no com-plaints.
Starbucks is a brand that car -ries a specific image, Myers said, and she feels the logo on the cup will definitely help increase sales.
However, Richard Lutz, a UF 
marketing professor, said it may not be just about the logo.
Lutz said although Starbucks 
has a very positive brand name, 
he believes consumers will care 
more about the money they save and the environmental concerns.
He said college students may be more likely than working 
adults to buy these new cups be-
cause of money, not age.
Corinne Maloy, a 19-year-old 
UF digital arts and sciences fresh-
man, said she thinks it’s good that 
Starbucks is trying to cut back on 
waste from disposable cups, but 
she probably won’t buy a reus-able cup for herself.
Maloy said she only buys Star -
bucks once or twice a month, and 
she is always losing and forget-
ting things. 
“I would gather up a stash of 
them,” she said.TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

� RESIDENTS WILL BE 
SELECTED LATE SPRING.

UF’s College of Dentistry’s 
new Oral and Maxillofacial 
Radiology Residency Program received its initial accreditation by the Commission on Den-
tal Accreditation earlier this 
month.
The program, which is one 
of only seven nationwide, will be housed in the College of Dentistry . It will train dental residents to become board cer -
tified in OMR, the American Dental Association’s newest 
specialty discipline.
The first class in the program 
will be selected late Spring and 
start this Summer, said Dr. Madhu Nair, chair of the De-partment of Oral and Maxillo-facial Diagnostic Sciences.
An oral and maxillofacial 
radiologist is a dentist who spe-
cializes in collecting X-ray im-
ages and studying the images for conditions that could affect the head and neck, according to the American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology’s website.
OMR specialists are in high 
demand.
“There’s a huge shortage of 
radiologists in this country, es-pecially in maxillofacial radiol-
ogy,” Nair said.
The program will also work 
in collaboration with UF’s Col-
lege of Medicine’s Radiology department.
The residents will work with 
radiologists and earn more experience working with Cat Scans and MRIs as well as other 
X-ray images.
“Our residents can learn a 
lot from the expert medical ra-
diologists when they go on ro-tation,” said Dr. Rujuta Katkar, a clinical assistant professor in the department.
Nair, Katkar and Dr. James 
C. Pettigrew Jr., director of the 
Division of Oral and Maxillofa-
cial Radiology , along with three other medical radiology faculty members, will teach residents.
“The new residency pro-
gram will be a great opportuni-ty for students at UF and across the world who are interested in a career in oral and maxillofa-
cial radiology,” Katkar said.Dental radiology

endorsement:
Students Party gets 
our vote — mostly
We’re not exactly interested in ﬂ  ashy party platforms. 
What happens when you can’t follow through on a promise? Or what if an idea will cost UF students 
more money that it should have at ﬁ  rst?
Our goal in this endorsement is not to pick a ﬁ  ght or to draw 
a line in the metaphorical and political sand.
We support the Students Party for the following reasons:We believe they will use their voice on the Board of Trust-
ees to do good for the university itself. It’s important to us that the UF Student Government president actually becomes a vocal advocate for the school’s interests. Although it’s hard to place full faith in anyone in that intimidating situation, we think the Students Party will act more in our best interest than its current opposition. Our representative on the Board of Trustees should 
be able to communicate the wants and needs of students rather 
than letting tuition get raised without a ﬁ  ght.
We believe they will work to use simple and logical solu-
tions to solve issues on campus rather than using and invent-
ing fancy technology . Although we understand the entire world is moving to a more digital phase of life, there are much more simple and cost-effective ways to improve campus life. For example, the ISIS alert system proposed by the Students Party makes sense to us, but the creation of a bunch of different apps 
proposed by the Swamp Party makes less sense. The Students 
Party also promises to seriously take a look at how SG is actually run and then make changes. There is no doubt in our minds that the current system is broken, and our fellow UF students are 
ill-informed about how things actually work. 
However, both parties are making strides toward a more 
transparent student government. The semi-regular “town hall” meetings that would be held by the Swamp Party are idealistic, but the Students Party will be starting an administration without 
any prior dirty campaign tactics.
It’s also difﬁ  cult for us to support the Students Party 100 
percent because, comparatively, it seems less experienced than 
its opponents. We take into consideration, though, that this is because they have potentially not received the opportunity of experience and legacy the Swamp Party holds.
We very much appreciated the honesty and earnestness of 
Joselyn Rivas and Jayce Victor, two candidates on the Swamp 
Party’s ticket. We urge the Students Party to please work with 
them. Those two candidates should be included in SG as much 
as possible, as we believe they truly care about acting to the best of their abilities. 
We loved the Swamp Party’s platform initiative to provide 
nutritional information in dining halls; that’s a smart way for people to make healthier choices. We also agree a more uniﬁ  ed “clicker” system could be implemented campus-wide.
What we’d like, though, is less of a focus on ﬂ  ashy platform 
points and more of a sense of caring when it comes to represent-ing UF students in the city and on the Board of Trustees.
Macklemore’s hit song “Thrift Shop” hit about 100 
million views last week, and I have to say, I felt 
strangely proud.
Not because Macklemore remains an unsigned artist in 
an industry in which you rely on your record label to bring you fame, or because a white guy from Seattle made it big, 
but because he made a rap song with the guts not to take 
itself seriously, and man, did that take long enough.
If there was ever a music genre that sometimes needed a 
dose of self-deprecating humor, it would be rap.
“Thrift Shop” was a small miracle moment where some-
body got the joke that even though rappers boast jewels, cars and the ﬁ  nest women that money can buy, their fan base could only possibly dream about it.
Is it likely that any given person between the ages of 14 
and 25 is cruisin’ in a Mercedes and sippin’ Patron? Nah 
man, but we shop in thrift stores. 
So hats off to Macklemore for making a catchy song 
about being broke.
To be honest, I haven’t had so much fun with a song since 
everyone still knew the words to “The Real Slim Shady.”
Gangsta rap ﬁ  nally died a hard death in the late 2000s, 
and thank God.
It’s taken a few more years than it should have to get 
all the grown men that make this music to stop trying to prove themselves as bona ﬁ  de O.G.s and ﬁ  nally start taking 
more risks with their genre. Rappers are now ﬁ  nally ﬁ  nd-
ing it marketable to take on edgier, smarter topics than to 
just keep having manhood-measuring contests about how much money they spend on absurd luxury items.
Rap music is now hitting a big bang of artists who aren’t 
afraid to venture into new territory. I think rappers now are realizing there is a whole other ball game to be played with their music because so many ideas have been left unsaid up 
to this point.
Sometimes the changes in styles or ideas may seem sub-
tle, but they will end up getting noticed by people in the 
business. Donald Glover, who goes by Childish Gambino for his music, once said in his stand-up act, “There’s black nerds everywhere now, which 
is awesome because I’m a black 
nerd, and that s--- was illegal un-til like 2003.” 
Donald credited Kanye West 
with nerd cred, and personally, I 
am going to toss in B.o.B as repre-
senting the nerdy-is-cool image.
Kanye West might have sin-
gle-handedly made thick-frame 
glasses hardcore because I can’t honestly remember a rap-
per who decided to wear those before him. 
Forget 50 Cent’s “I-would-survive-in-prison” muscles 
— sharp-dressed nerds are making a comeback.
Risk-taking rappers have certainly proved themselves in 
mainstream music, and I think that says something about how the artists are getting bolder with doing what they 
want ﬁ  rst and letting the audience follow the lead. 
That ranges from Macklemore rapping on gay marriage 
to Kid Cudi creating an electronica space-age album to ev-
eryone still trying to ﬁ  gure out Tyler, The Creator.
So hopefully history will vindicate this branching-out 
effort in some way, although I’m not getting my hopes up too much because nostalgia tends to get weirdly selective 
on the historical details. 
I couldn’t tell you who was changing the world in 2003, 
but nowadays, if anyone was to yell out, “To the win-
dooooow,” then they would get a “to the wall” from me 
without a second thought.
Until that day, though, I am just looking forward to 
what’s around the corner for rap music.
Boundaries are now up for reinterpretation, and ladies 
and gents, it’s going to get weird, funny, self-aware and crazy up in here, and I am so excited. 
I think we have never seen a better time for rap music 
than right now, and here’s to hoping it only gets better.

You should care about your Student Government be-
cause you pay $16.06 per credit hour, about $385 a year if you are a full-time undergraduate or $289 if 
you are a graduate student. SG’s $18.2 million budget comes entirely from the students, but it’s not run by the students themselves. No one is really at fault. The “winner-take-all” or “ﬁ  rst-past-the-post” elections facilitate a two-party sys-
tem that is not very representative of the Student Body’s 
interests. As a result, students feel disenfranchised, turnout for SG elections is dismal and the cycle perpetuates itself.
If SG really wanted to be representative of all the stu-
dents, parties would not worry about having a certain 
number of minorities in their parties. They would amend 
the SG Constitution to establish “proportional representa-tion” in its elections. This percentage-based rule allocates the number of seats a party wins based on the number of votes cast. For example, in running for a block of six Senate seats, like in the CLAS Bloc, if party A received 50 percent 
of the votes, party B got 30 percent and party C had 20 per-
cent, then party A would get three Senate seats, party B two seats and party C one seat. The system itself would be more representative of students’ interests by letting more 
students organize into parties, compete in fair elections and 
hold ofﬁ  ces in SG. Students would feel empowered because they would get what they vote for.
Changing the Constitution requires a two-thirds major-
ity vote in Senate, and the current party in power has no 
incentive to change the election rule because it would make 
way for more political participation in the system. The Students Party is committed to changing this rule but can-not do so unless it wins the election Wednesday. Last year, it lost the ex-ecutive race by only 114 votes. If the 
Students Party wins this year, it will 
have the necessary numbers in Sen-ate and the support of the executive. The best part of changing the elec-
tion rule to proportional representation is once the Senate has more political parties, it will be much harder to get the two-thirds majority to change it back — it will be a lasting solution.

Speaking Out
Have you ever seen an argu-
ment defeated because some-one agreed with it?
If not, sit back, relax and enjoy.The argument goes along the lines 
of: “Video games are bad because they can make people violent, spur-
ring those people to commit horrible 
atrocities they would have never even considered had they spent their time doing something else.”
For the sake of this column, I’ll 
agree with that and even make some points supporting that. The “Super Mario Bros.” franchise is just as much of a power trip as the “Call of Duty” 
series, with both games requiring the 
player to slaughter countless enemies. “Metroid” forces the protagonist to hunt a species to extinction. “Poké-mon” and other creature-raising 
games encourage animal cruelty. The 
dynasties I mentioned — minus “Call of Duty” — are all from Nintendo, the company that has made its brand into 
a family-friendly one.
Even “Madden,” the football-sim-
ulation series, is violent because foot-
ball itself is a violent sport.
However, accepting the idea that 
video games can make someone vio-lent boils down to accepting that vid-eo games imprint upon the player.
Video games imprint violence, thus 
they are a negative force on society.
That view is a sorely limited view 
of video games, though.
For every game, there is more to it 
than violence.
“Mario” games condition the play-
er to be a moral force of good, never ceasing in one’s quest until the villain is defeated and the princess returned 
safely. “Metroid” games require you 
to destroy a species hell-bent on de-struction, saving the universe in the process. “Pokémon” encourages the bonds between trainer and creature, 
emphasizing partnership and the in-
herent value of every living thing — from small bugs to dragons.
Video games inspire perseverance. 
As games get harder, players face failure more often until overcoming 
the obstacle 
and achieving their goals. Video games 
create bea-
cons of hope 
in players who transformed their dig-ital worlds into utopias and now seek ideals in the real world. Some games 
can even tear down walls the player 
has put up, causing him or her to ma-ture and see life in a new way.
Games have provided people with 
dream jobs. Sony and Nissan’s GT Academy plucks the best virtual rac-ers from their televisions and trains them into professional race car driv-ers.  The show “Survivor” took a 
champion of a ﬁ  ghting game and 
made him a contestant. There is even a major league for video games, al-lowing a simple hobby to become a 
profession. 
Video games can be violent, yes. I 
don’t dispute that one bit, but I can 
point out other media forms that are violent. Print can be violent, as books 
can go into gory detail about how one 
person kills another in a bid for be-coming royalty. 
Television is violent, as crime 
dramas rise in popularity and news broadcasts sometimes focus on crimes that are an affront to the most basic principles of morality. Even radio can be violent, going all the way back to 
its heyday, in which the “War of the 
Worlds” broadcast prompted panic due to the idea of martians invading and killing off humans.
We don’t dispute the beneﬁ  ts those 
media forms provide. We accept the violence in those media forms as a trade-off for the greater good they serve.
Video games are no different.

opinions@alligator.orgThere are few things I love more than 
opera, and I’m not talking about the Web browser. 
This may sound silly, but opera has 
truly contributed a lot to my life.
At ﬁ  rst, I thought the singers sounded 
strange, but I’ve really come to enjoy the 
sound of a well-trained voice. 
It’s an acquired taste, but it’s well worth 
acquiring.
I recall someone once saying rhythm 
and blues is raw and emotional, whereas Baroque and Classical music are controlled 
and dull. 
I wholeheartedly disagree.I challenge any reader to ﬁ  nd a piece 
more lovely and conveying more longing than “Dido’s Lament” from Henry Purcell’s “Dido and Aeneas.” 
I challenge any reader to ﬁ  nd a scene 
more grand and haunting than the 
Commendatore’s scene from Mozart’s 
“Don Giovanni.” 
I challenge any reader to ﬁ  nd a more 
ﬂ  irty and reﬁ  ned tune than the famous 
Habanera aria from Georges Bizet’s 
“Carmen.” 
Part of what makes opera great is 
precisely the controlled quality my unfortunate acquaintance was referring to. 
Many people come together from 
different ﬁ  elds of the arts, oftentimes having dedicated their lives to their art, and make spectacles that to this day stand 
among the most noble of art forms.
If you’re bored and have two hours to 
spend, you should spend those hours on 
the movie “Amadeus.” 
That’s how I was introduced to opera, 
and it’s a great primer.
You know what else is good? I promise it is.“Battlestar Galactica.” 
I have literally never seen anything 
better than “Battlestar Galactica.” 
Really, though.
Nothing has ever been more excellently 
done, in my opinion, and I don’t hand out 
such a designation lightly. 
Not a science ﬁ  ction fan? 
That won’t matter. This series transcends such petty 
boundaries to deliver a supremely human story.
If you’re bored and have another two 
hours to spend, spend them on the pilot 
miniseries called “Night.” 
You won’t regret it.So, why have I decided to write a column about things that I like? 
Because I 
genuinely think these things are awesome and that anyone who comes into contact with them will beneﬁ  t from them.
Also, it’s 
because I’m continually bafﬂ  ed at how much attention twits get.
Now, I’m not about to make the mistake 
the out of touch Wednesday columnist made. 
He seemed to say that rappers, without 
exception, “spew ﬁ  lth and objectify women.” 
Although there are rap artists who do 
engage in such senselessness, there are also rap artists out there who arguably do just the opposite.
There’s a  big problem, though.I think too few of the talented rap artists 
get too little attention, while too many of the untalented rappers get too much attention.
Why is this?I think part of it has to do with the fact that 
as a culture we’ve, at least to some extent, turned away from what is wholesome and beautiful.
Instead, we’ve turned more toward 
whatever garbage can be mass produced at a low price and successfully marketed.
And there’s a problem with this.There’s no lack of talent in the world. Humanity is brimming with people who 
express their souls through art.
They dedicate their lives to something 
excellent.
 They throw themselves onto their 
instruments.
But they are only heard by very few. Meanwhile, Justin Bieber sighs and much 
of the world sighs with him.
I just don’t know anymore.So, if you are inclined to agree with the 
aforementioned Wednesday columnist and 
have even a couple of minutes to spend, I 
encourage you to spend them looking up 
some of the underground rap artists out there. 
Trust me.You’ll almost certainly be astonished.
I was.

Elisa Zeron understands how 
difficult it is to pay for college.
“I couldn’t imagine paying for 
college without the Pell Grant,” said 
the 19-year-old Santa Fe College 
student. “I know it can be done. It 
would just be hard.”
Zeron is just one of about 10 mil-
lion students who receive the grant.
A study conducted last week by 
the University of Alabama’s Educa-tion Policy Center found that com-munity colleges in the South are be-ing hurt the most by changes to the Pell Grant.
However, SFC doesn’t necessar -
ily see the changes as negative.
The Pell Grant is federally fund-
ed and awarded to certain college students depending on their finan-cial needs. When a student fills out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, it determines his or her eligibility.
One of the changes to the grant, which took effect this school year, is the length of time students can use the funding. 
Instead of a nine-year limit, stu-
dents are now only allowed six years to use their grant.Matt Stubbington, associate di-
rector of financial aid at SFC, said the biggest change affecting SFC stu-dents is the time limit for the grant.
“Last year, we had to inform 
about 400 students that they would no longer be eligible for the grant,” 
he said.
Although the changes to the 
grant may attempt to save money , 
it’s also a way to motivate students to try harder in school and finish in a timely manner, Stubbington said.
“The goal of the department of education is to get students to 
matriculate and graduate with a degree,” he said. “They’re encour -
aging students to get out into the workforce.”
Although nine years may seem 
like a long time to complete an un-
dergraduate degree, Zeron said she sees how it could take that long.
“Some students just don’t know 
what they want to do when they come to college,” she said. “Some-times those students might need nine years to figure it out.”
Students in South see biggest changes to Pell Grant, study says
“The positive thing we’re 
seeing from these changes 
is a push to make students 
work harder.”

OTHER SCHOOLS.

After being grilled for about five hours on 
all topics related to science, a team of five high 
school students in Gainesville is preparing to blast off to the National Science Bowl’s region-al competition.
The 16- to 18-year-old Eastside High School 
students recently won the qualifier competi-tion and will advance to the regional compe-tition Saturday at Armstrong Atlantic State University in Savannah, Ga. They will com-
pete against 19 other schools for a slot at the 
national competition.
The Jeopardy-style, double-elimination 
competition includes questions covering a broad range of scientific topics from biology to chemistry to math.
For Yuxin Zhang, a 16-year-old EHS junior 
and team member, preparation means putting in the extra time to have a competitive edge. 
Because EHS doesn’t offer earth and space sci-
ence classes — Zhang’s area of specialty on the science bowl team — she said it’s pushed her to study on her own. Zhang deals 
with topics she enjoys along 
with ones she isn’t fond of.
“I don’t like memorizing 
[different] kinds of soil,” she said.
Last year, David Liu, a 
17-year-old EHS senior and 
team captain, said the team faltered in the last round of the regional tournament when one 
member tried to answer before a judge ac-
knowledged him — a technicality that cost the team a spot in the national competition. Liu said his team spends about six hours a week practicing for competitions using sample 
questions and a $250 buzzer system.
“The fact that it’s so fast paced lends to a lot 
of pressure and mistakes,” he said. “I like how 
it’s not a paper-based test. You can see the ac-tual people you’re competing against.”
Chen Liu, a UF pathophysiology professor 
and the team’s coach, said the competition is helpful in giving high school students a com-petitive edge for college entry.
“In class, you won’t have the opportunity 
to bring all these subjects together,” he said. Eastside High students to compete in regional science bowl

As Eric Hanhold got the final out 
on a slow ground ball to second base, 
the Gators emptied the dugout to celebrate their season-opening series win.
The freshman right-hander was the 
10th Florida reliever to pitch against Duke. Despite the series win, coach Kevin O’Sullivan spent more time on the mound than he wanted to.
His starting pitchers didn’t go after 
the Blue Devils. They nibbled. They missed spots. They didn’t get it done.
“I wasn’t really pleased how 
our starters threw this weekend,” O’Sullivan said. “They’ve got to get better. You can’t be going to the bullpen in the third or fourth inning. 
I know we’re on a pitch count, but 
they’ve got to get better.”
Florida’s weekend rotation didn’t get out of the fifth inning.
All three pitchers — Jonathon 
Crawford, Tucker Simpson and Justin Shafer — had pitch limits. They went to a three-ball counts against one-
third of their batters faced.
The defense suffered. Florida com-
mitted eight errors. Games dragged 
on as the balls and mound visits piled up.
Players lost focus. Shortstop Richie 
Martin booted a groundball in the opener. Catcher Taylor Gushue had three errors on Saturday. Vickash

Jennifer George knows she must improve her play 
for the Gators to turn around their slumping season.
Though she has marginally regressed from a break-
out year in 2011-12, her statistics are still respectable. 
With just four games remaining during the regu-
lar season, George is averaging 12.2 points per game, 
which ties her with Jaterra Bonds for the team lead. The senior forward leads UF in rebounding, pulling down 7.9 boards per contest. 
But George has failed to be the steadying force 
coach Amanda Butler hoped her only senior would be on an inexperienced team. 
Florida has floundered 
during Southeastern Confer -
ence play as a result. 
“Jennifer has struggled to put 40 minutes together,” 
Butler said. “She’s got a little bit more to give. It’s really going to be critical down the stretch that not just Jen-nifer but everyone is playing their best basketball.”
George’s performance against Georgia on Sunday 
exemplified the issue that has plagued her and UF since she first suffered a dislocated right shoulder 
against LSU on Jan. 6.
In a 62-57 loss — Florida’s eighth loss of the season 
by 10 points or fewer — George led the Gators with 17 
points and pulled down seven rebounds. 
But her numbers conceal a trend that has devel-
oped in her game and become an epidemic for Florida — a failure to play two consistently productive halves of basketball.
Before halftime, George equaled her four points 
with four turnovers. Two of her miscues came in the first 2:40, forcing Butler to pull George from the game for nearly 6 minutes.
“We were just trying to encourage her and help 
her,” Butler said. “It’s very difficult when someone is trying to battle something that is not skill-related. 
But I think that’s where Jennifer is right now. It’s very Senior struggling

The last time Florida played Missouri, 
the game got ugly. UF cruised to an 83-52 
blowout on Jan. 19. 
But as the Gators get ready to take on 
the Tigers for the second time this season, they will face a slightly different Missouri team.
On Jan. 9, Laurence Bowers, the Tigers’ 
second-leading scorer with 14.1 points per game, sprained his MCL during an 84-68 loss to Alabama. Bowers missed the next five games because of his injury, including Missouri’s 31-point defeat against Florida in the O’Connell Center.
But on Jan. 30, Bowers returned to the 
court to face LSU.
The No. 5 Gators (21-3, 11-1 SEC) must 
now account for Bowers against the Tigers (18-7, 7-5 SEC) tonight at 9 in Columbia, 
Mo.
“(Bowers is) a guy that has been ref-
erenced by their team and coaches as the 
heart-and-soul guy of their team,” coach 
Billy Donovan said. “He’s a very good 
player. He can do a lot of different things. He can rebound, score from the low post, 
shoot threes, he’s crafty, good defensively 
and he’s a very smart player. 
“I think anytime you take a player like 
that off the team, your team is going to be a little different. Certainly, he’s an older guy, a veteran and an experienced guy, him be-ing back only makes their team better.”
With junior Will Yeguete still recover -
ing from arthroscopic surgery on his right 
knee, and Bowers returning for Missouri, 
Florida will need younger players like freshman Michael Frazier II to at times de-fensively.
Although Frazier has been sound of-
fensively for the Gators with 6.3 points per game while averaging 19 minutes, he has struggled at times defensively. Florida facing stronger Missouri squad in rematch on roadsee GeORGe, p AGe 14

UF guardhard for her to come back from an 
injury that impacts everything you do.”
George struggled throughout 
the first half before finding her 
groove after halftime.
She scored 13 points in the sec-
ond half, going head-to-head with 
Georgia senior forward Jasmine Hassell, who scored 16 points and grabbed 16 rebounds in the game.  
“I thought she played a really, 
really solid and inspired second half,” Butler said. “That was im-
portant for us.”
Of the improved second half, 
George said: “The first half I was 
more passive and trying to pass 
more … I just tried to be more ag-
gressive in the second half.”
George was equally assertive 
early in the season. She averaged 14.6 points during Florida’s non-conference slate and 14.5 in her first two SEC games. 
But recovering from two shoul-
der dislocations has been difficult.
“Until the injury, (she was) 
our leading scorer and leading re-bounder,” Butler said. “That really got her off track. It’s a hard thing to bounce back from mentally.”
George missed only one game 
— Florida’s 52-44 loss to South Carolina on Jan. 20. However, she has not been the same since.She identified that fact follow-
ing the Gators’ loss on Sunday. 
“I have to stop playing like I’m 
hurt,” George said. “As a senior, I think I’m not doing as much as I can do. I can lead a lot better, and that’s what I need to do to get the team back on track.”

No. 17 Florida (2-1) takes on UCF (2-1) tonight at 6:30 in Or -
lando. O’Sullivan will send Keenan Kish to the mound for the 
junior’s first college start.
The  sixth-year coach intends to on use several pitchers against 
the Knights during the Gators’ first midweek game of 2013.  
UF finished 11-3 in midweek contests last year after posting a 7-7 mark in 2011.
“We are going to run some young guys out there probably 
and piece this thing together,” O’Sullivan said. “I do feel good about how our freshmen threw this weekend. I’ll be honest with you. I thought they handled it very well.”
Excluding Simpson, the lone freshman starting pitcher, 
Florida’s five newcomers didn’t allow an 
earned run in six innings of relief.
The Gators’ bullpen allowed only 
three earned runs in 16.2 innings.
“I’m not going to be settled on this 
weekend’s rotation the way it is if guys aren’t going to get 
ahead and do the things we’ve taught them,” O’Sullivan said. “We’ve got plenty of options. It’s as simple as that.”
Powers earns weekly honor: Zack Powers hit two grand slams 
against Duke on Sunday. The last Florida player to accomplish 
the feat was Preston Tucker, who hit two grand slams in a 16-3 win against UCF on April 8, 2009. 
Collegiate Baseball took notice of Powers’ feat, naming the 
sophomore one of the Louisville Slugger National Players of the Week for the first time in his career.
Powers, who went 3 for 6 with nine RBI against the Blue 
Devils, was one of five honorees. 
For Powers, the blasts were the first grand slams he could re-
member since playing little league. He started playing baseball at the age of five.
All he got from his coaches and teammates was a simple 
“good game,” and a postgame perk.
“I get extra food when we go through the line after the 
game,” Powers said. “That’s about it.”

75-36 win against South Carolina on Jan. 30 in the O’Connell Center.
Freshman guard’s work improving 
defense paying dividends for UF
But Frazier has been focused on improving 
his defense.
“Just mentally having the mindset to play de-
fense for 35 seconds is the hardest thing for guys 
coming in, because in high school, you don’t have to really focus on defense that much,” Fra-zier said.
“I have a long way to go defensively, but I’m 
getting better every day. My coaches and my teammates are on me, so when you have people like that around you, you can’t help but get bet-ter.”
Guard Mike Rosario added: “He’s always 
asking questions before he starts to do anything, and as a freshman, you always want to ask peo-ple who have experience.”
In addition to preparing for a newly added 
Bowers, Florida also needs to worry about fac-ing Missouri in Mizzou Arena. 
The Tigers have a 14-0 record at home this 
season, and they won those games by an aver -
age margin of 20 points per contest.
The Gators, on the other hand, have a 7-3 
road record, including their first SEC loss, which came on Feb. 5 in a 80-69 defeat to the 
Razorbacks in Fayetteville, Ark.“It’s going to be a tough environment for us 
tomorrow,” Rosario said. “We’ve been in situa-
tions like this throughout the whole year play-ing on the road, and I feel like this is just another challenge for us.”  
With Florida facing a top SEC team in a road 
environment, it will need to rely on its bal-anced offense to leave Missouri with a win. The Gators have four players averaging double-digit 
points. 
Junior Scottie Wilbekin is just shy of double 
figures with 9.4 points per game.
“I’ve always just been a big believer that you 
need balance, because I do think in certain situa-
tions, whether a guy is not shooting the ball well or if the defense has done something to take the guy out of the game,” Donovan said. “They’ve got to be able to adjust to what the defense is 
giving you.”

Alyssa Bache’s first inning in 2013 was 
not her finest hour.
The sophomore gave up a two-run home 
run and threw a wild pitch in relief of start-
er Lauren Haeger against Creighton on Feb. 8.
Luckily for Bache, the runs didn’t matter. 
The Gators had mashed their way to a 13-1 lead before she entered the game. Bache fin-ished her inning with three strikeouts, and Florida won 13-3. 
But Bache’s luck changed in her next 
three outings.
In her only start during the Kajikawa 
Classic in Tempe, Ariz., Bache tossed a complete-game shutout. However, she struggled with her command, walking five.
When the No. 5 Gators (12-0) came home 
for the Florida Lipton Invitational, Bache’s pitching reached new heights.
Against Savannah State on Friday, Bache 
came two outs away from tossing the first Florida no-hitter since Stephanie Brom-bacher pitched five hitless innings against N.C. State on Feb. 12, 2011.
“I didn’t want to say anything to any-
body, and I was hoping nobody would say anything to me,” Bache said. 
Bache’s no-hit bid was broken up by Sa-
vannah State shortstop Tiffany Taylor, but 
it wasn’t the pressure of the situation that 
got to Bache.
“I’ve been in those situations,” Bache 
said. “Last year, I had a couple of them, and of course, they didn’t happen. But in high school I threw like seven perfect games, so 
I’m used to it.”
After having her chance at Gators histo-
ry taken away on Friday, Bache came back 
to torment Tigers batters again on Saturday.
Although her chances 
for a no-hitter were broken 
up in the second inning on Saturday, her second 
performance against Sa-vannah State might have surpassed the first.
Bache struck out nine Tigers on Sat-
urday, the most by any Gators hurler this season. Her strikeout total was the highest of her career, topping her previous best of five.
“I wasn’t even counting,” Bache said. “I was just trying to throw, trying to get them 
to swing to get outs. That’s all I was think-
ing about.”
Her pitch location also improved. Bache 
didn’t walk a single batter, and five of her 
strikeouts caught Savannah State batters 
looking.
Bache has arguably been Florida’s best 
pitcher through the Gators’ first 12 games.
She leads the Florida staff in ERA by 
more than a run.
More advanced statistics give Bache an 
edge, too. Bache leads junior Hannah Rog-ers in WHIP by  0.14, and she has a Fielding 
Independent Pitching average of -0.47, 0.25 
points lower than Rogers’ mark.
“It’s awesome to have [Rogers] … to help 
me out,” Bache said.
“We’re just both doing great right now.”Sophomore pitcher rebounding from slow start to 2013

Following a 13-7 win 
against High Point, coach 
Amanda O’Leary pointed out 
a statistic Florida should note. 
She did not point out that 
the Gators had posted their 
first 3-0 start in program his-
tory. She also didn’t men-
tion that UF had just ended a three-game road trip.
O’Leary did point out that 
in all three games, Florida al-
lowed its opponent to score 
first.
The No. 3 Gators (3-0) have 
fallen victim to slow starts in 
all three contests in 2013.
“Obviously, it’s not the 
way we want to start a game,” 
O’Leary said. “You always want to start off with the first 
goal on the board, but it hasn’t hurt us up to this point.”
Dating back to March 2012, 
Florida is 6-0 when allowing 
the opposing team to grab the first goal. Though the un-
defeated mark is encourag-
ing, O’Leary does not want slow starts to continue to be a trend.
“When we step out onto 
that field, we have to be ready to play,” O’Leary said after 
defeating High Point. “It is 
a concern because you don’t want that momentum to 
shift at the beginning of the 
game.”
Senior attacker Kitty Cullen 
has helped swing the momen-
tum back in the Gators’ favor 
in each contest this season.
Cullen has scored Florida’s 
first goal in all three matches, helping dig her club out of 
1-0 holes twice and a 3-0 defi-cit against North Carolina on Feb. 9 in Chapel Hill, N.C. 
Cullen’s five goals are tied 
for second on the team.
“She knows when a team 
scores we need to rebound 
back,” O’Leary said, “And she takes it upon herself to be that person.”
Cullen is the career leader 
in goals scored at UF with 153.
“Throughout her years 
here at Florida, she’s willing 
to put her head down and get 
that first goal,” O’Leary said. “That’s just her mentality.”
With No. 19 Stony Brook 
ahead on Wednesday, O’Leary 
joked that seeing the same re-
sult that happened in the ear -
ly matches so far wouldn’t be too bad.
“We’ve won three games 
with giving up the first goal,” O’Leary said. “So we might try to give up the first goal in the next couple and see how 
that works.”UF working to eliminate slow 
starts despite successful rallies

Brianna Morgan led the way for 
the Gators in Chapel Hill, N.C., on 
Monday.
The freshman won 6-1, 6-1 in 
two sets against UNC senior Lau-ren McHale to help Florida earn a 4-2 victory against No. 1 North 
Carolina.
“[Monday] was the day we 
found out that 
our team had 
heart,” coach Ro-
land Thornqvist 
said in a release. “If you want to achieve anything, 
that’s the No. 1 
ingredient.”
Morgan’s victory helped UF 
tie the score 2-2 midway through singles play, effectively rebound-
ing after losing the doubles point 
to UNC.
Olivia Janowicz came back 
from a rocky singles match against 
Duke’s Marianna Jodoin on Sun-
day to grab the first point for Florida. Janowicz defeated North Carolina’s Tessa Lyons 6-2, 6-1 in 
singles.
Fourth-ranked Lauren Embree 
gave the Gators a 3-2 lead after 
three sets against the Tar Heels’ 
Gina Suarez-Malaguti.
Embree won a 6-4 decision in 
the first set but lost focus in the 
second, giving Suarez-Malaguti an easy 6-1 win. Embree came 
back aggressively in the final set, 
clinching match point in a 6-2 vic-tory.
The singles match was Em-
bree’s 100th career singles win at Florida.
Sofie Oyen won her singles 
match as well, clinching the final point to seal a road win for Flor -
ida.
“This is one of the best wins 
that I can remember,” Thornqvist said in a release.
“The biggest hole we’ve been in 
as a unit and to be able to dig our -
selves out of it against this quality of a team that North Carolina has. ... For us to be able to what we did 
today against that quality team af-
ter losing to Duke, I just can’t say enough.”Florida defeats North

The Gators are trying to get over 
the hump.
The Florida men’s and women’s 
swimming and diving teams begin 
competition at the Southeastern Con-ference Championship meet, and the men are aiming to finally send Au-burn home empty-handed.
Auburn has been a thorn in Flor -
ida’s side when the SEC champion-ship is on the line each February .  
The last time the Tigers failed to 
win the SEC men’s championship was 1996.
Auburn walked away winners 
from the past 11 SEC championship meets. The Tigers have won 18 of the past 19 SEC swimming and diving titles.
The Gators already handled the 
Tigers once this season. Florida went on the road and handed undefeated Auburn its only loss of the season 
in a 167-133 victory on Jan. 26. UF 
swept the top three spots in the 1000 free, the 200 IM and the 500 free and claimed the top two places in the 200 free and the 200 butterfly.
Topping the Tigers and reassert-
ing the Gators’ place atop the SEC will rely largely on relays, said asso-ciate head coach Anthony Nesty . 
“With preparation toward the 
SEC’s and NCAA’s, our relays are going to come around,” Nesty said. 
“They’re going to get better, so 
hopefully , we’ve done the things necessary for our guys to continue to improve in individual events, and swimming the relays will just contin-ue to take care of themselves.”
But Nesty said the SEC 
meet is just a stepping stone 
en route to a grander stage.  
“The big meet for us is obviously 
NCAA’s,” Nesty said. 
While Florida’s men are facing a 
20-year-championship slump, the women are attempting to climb a less daunting historic hill.
The UF women last won the SEC 
championship in 2009. Georgia has 
held the top spot for the past three 
years.
Florida’s women finished at 3-4 in 
its dual-meet season, but only won two of their five SEC meets.16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 2013

Bridget Sloan had rarely been rooted against before ar -
riving at Florida. 
But in front of a Pete Maravich Assembly Center crowd 
of 4,074 on Jan. 11 in Baton Rouge, La., Sloan was booed 
for the first time in her gymnastics career.
It was a culture shock for the former Olympian who has 
competed on some of the world’s biggest stages in gym-nastics. She was taken aback by the unwelcome response. 
Sloan and All-American Marissa King had uncharacter -
istic missteps on beam and forced Florida to count a fall toward its final beam total of 48.775. 
Sloan was rattled by the crowd noise. “That was her first experience, and we have to give her 
that,” coach Rhonda Faehn said of Sloan. 
“It was her first time ever competing on 
the road in college, and it is quite a bit different than anywhere she’s been used 
to.”
But against No. 9 Georgia on Saturday, 
Sloan did not seem bothered by the Stege-man Coliseum crowd.
She looked the part of a veteran gym-

Sloan claimed her third all-around title Saturday. She 
became just the second Gator freshman in program history to earn three wins. All-America Kytra Hunter was the first to do it in 2012. 
Sloan matched her highest bars routine with a 9.95, and 
her 39.6 was her highest all-around of the year. 
Against Arkansas two weeks earlier, she set a career-
high on balance beam with a score of 9.925. She also claimed her first all-around title with a previous season-
high of 39.55. 
Sloan’s progression during her freshman campaign has 
aided an already deep Florida roster and kept her light 
during competition. 
“I am honestly having the time of my life,” Sloan said. 
“It has been such a great experience for me, and I can’t imagine doing anything else. I love competing, and I love performing. I get to do those things every weekend.”Freshman performing
