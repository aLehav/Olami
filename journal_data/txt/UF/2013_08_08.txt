U don’t have to Haul your be-
longings to a new place.
Gainesville’s moving compa-
nies recognize how hectic the end 
of the summer is, and many can give advice to help students save money and reduce stress.
For example, All My Sons Moving and Storage offers hourly rates. Quote specialist Sam Mitch-ell said Gainesville students mov-ing out of a dorm or one-bedroom 
apartment will pay about $90 per 
hour for two movers and a 26-foot box truck.
Mitchell recommended stu-
dents confirm their moving com-pany is licensed and insured.
“What if they’re carrying your plasma screen TV, and they break it?” Mitchell said. “Then you’re screwed.”
UF Mover Guys founder Jor-
dan Speisman agreed the quality of the employees is important. Students should feel comfortable with them. For example, Speis-man said he would let his movers watch his children.

� UF WAS RANKED NO. 3 IN 
'LOTS OF BEER,' TOO.
KAITLYN WILSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Gator Nation is well 
known for its rowdy reptiles 
filling the Swamp to support the 
orange and blue, but according 
to The Princeton Review, this may no longer be the case. 
In the 2014 edition of “The 
Best 378 Colleges,” UF comes in at No. 11 in “Students Pack the Stadiums.” Last year, UF was ranked No. 3 on that list.
The No. 1 spot went to the 
University of Notre Dame, followed by the University of Southern California and The University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill. The first SEC school 
was the University of Missouri, which ranked fifth.
Florida State University 
scored one higher than UF, 
taking the No. 10 spot.
The book’s co-author, David 
Soto, said this review was based 
on a survey answered by 126,000 
students at America’s top 378 
colleges. 
“Those students went to 
our online survey and told us about various aspects of 
campus life including their 
social life, academics, student life and other important issues on campus,” Soto said. “We use that information to compile 
our 62 ranking lists — many of 
which the University of Florida is on this year.”
Tori Petry, a 21-year-old 
UF telecommunication senior, 
said she attends every Gators 
home game but understands why the ranking dropped so dramatically.
“I’m really disappointed in 
the student body for letting that drop so far,” Petry said, citing the low turnout at last year’s games. “I think our school is prestigious 
for sports, as well as academics, 
and we have a long history and tradition of football. There isn’t any reason why we shouldn’t 
be able to pack out the stadium,  
regardless of ranking.”
Other students, like Wynston 
Jenns, a 21-year-old elementary education senior, said she has seen a decline in attendance over the course of her time at UF. 
“I think it has to do with 
expectations of students,” Jenns said. “When our expectations aren’t met, we don’t show up as Princeton Review 
says Gators pack

As Summer B winds to an end, Gainesville's Regional 
Transit System announced bus schedule changes that will 
take effect Saturday.
All UF campus service will be suspended, as will routes 
21, 38 and Later Gator services.
On Route 20, buses will run every 30 minutes. Buses on Route 34 will run every 50 minutes, and Route 43 will stop service at 6:25 p.m., according to an RTS flier. 
Other routes with reduced service include 1, 9, 10, 12,

Normal Fall service will resume Aug. 19, and Later 
Gator services will resume Aug. 21.To stay updated, students should 
check the RTS website, said Chip Skin-ner, RTS marketing and communications 
supervisor.
“We try to make it as easy as possible 
to find out which buses are coming and 
when students can catch them,” he said.
A rider alert on the site's homepage 
reminds people that even though they 
might not be able to find their buses on the Gator Loca-tor site at www.ufl.transloc.com, RTS runs all scheduled

entire staff for a job well done.
‘Frankenfish’ hooked in Virginia a 
world record 
SPOTSYLVANIA, Va. — A 
Virginia man who caught a fish 
known as “Frankenfish” has set a world record.
Caleb Newton hooked the 17-
pound, 6-ounce northern snake-head in a creek in northern Vir-ginia during a fishing tournament June 1. The “Frankenfish” gets its nickname because of its appear-ance and adaptability. The inva-sive species native to Asia is able to breathe air and survive in very shallow waters or mud.
The Free Lance-Star reports the 
International Game Fish Associa-tion confirmed the record catch. It 
beat a snakehead caught in Japan 
in 2004 by 2 ounces.
Newton is a 27-year-old 
plumber in Spotsylvania County. He has said it only took him about a minute to get it into the boat, and the 3-foot-long fish barely fit into his cooler.
Man finds maggots on sandwich 
at Atlanta airport 
ATLANTA — A restaurant 
says it has switched vendors after 
a customer found a cluster of mag-gots on his sandwich at Atlanta’s airport.
Weekly traveler Joel Woloshuk 
told WSB-TV Tuesday that he bought a sandwich from Café In-termezzo and realized the white specks on top of it were maggots — not parmesan — when they be-gan moving.
In a statement to WSB-TV, Café 
Intermezzo’s president said the 
case was isolated and the problem 
could not have originated at the restaurant. He says the restaurant switched bread vendors and “not a single crumb” from the original bulb” that is the sun in summer.
While some people might find 
it strange to live somewhere with extended periods of sunlight or darkness, Patuk Glenn, museum curator at the Inupiat Heritage Center, said residents have grown accustomed to the seasons.
“Most of us, anyway, don’t re-
ally suffer from that seasonal af-
fective thing,” she said, adding, 
“It’s just part of life.”
Things like successful spring 
and fall subsistence whale hunts are cause for excitement in Bar-row, she said. There’s no real fuss about the first sunset in months.
Like Green, she didn’t stay up 
to see it.
“You know, I’m sleeping at 
that time,” she said, noting she has a job to get to in the morning.
Gunman talked about witchcraft 
in 911 call 
MIAMI  — The South Florida 
man who went on a shooting spree 
at his apartment complex, killing six people, called 911 to report he was being followed and threat-
ened by people doing witchcraft 
on him hours before the attack.
In the bizarre 12-minute call, 
Pedro Vargas, 42, asked the dis-patcher if she could run the license plate of a vehicle parked outside his building. His mother then got on the phone, telling the dispatch-er her son was acting strangely.
The dispatcher told Esperanza 
Patterson, 83, she had officers en route to the apartment, but the mother told her not to send them, explaining first that she feared her son would turn against her, and later, that he was not there.
“He might think I’m his en-
emy,” she said in Spanish.
The call was placed Friday at 
1:37 p.m. About five hours later, Vargas set the apartment on fire and killed the husband and wife building managers, a family of three and a man who was return-ing from his son’s boxing prac-tice.
Vargas held police at bay for 
eight hours, exchanging gunfire and then taking two people hos-tage at gunpoint. A SWAT team eventually stormed an apartment early Saturday, rescuing both hos-tages and killing Vargas.
Angel Prieto, a resident at the 
apartment complex, said the offi-cers should have been sent, even if 
Vargas’ mother insisted that they 
were not needed.
“Maybe this chaos wouldn’t 
have happened,” Prieto said. “It’s better to lose time and go there than not to have gone.”

Atlanta Department of Avia-

Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport restaurants so they can better inspect food shipments.
The Clayton County Board of 
Health says it found no citable violation at the location that it inspected.
Cardboard officer cuts crime at 
Mass. subway stop 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — The 
burly officer watching over the 
bike racks at a Boston-area trans-portation hub is a real stiff.
As part of an effort to cut 
crime at the Alewife MBTA subway and bus station in Cam-bridge, transit police placed a cardboard cutout of a police offi-cer in the bicycle cage. Hundreds of people use the racks daily.
Deputy Chief Robert Lene-
han says the fake cop, along with video cameras and a new lock, 
has cut bike thefts by 67 percent.
It’s also a money saver. Lene-
han estimates it would cost 
$200,000 a year to have an officer watch over the cage full time.
The cutout is actually a pic-
ture of real MBTA Officer David Silen.
Silen says the split second 
thieves take to glance at the cutout is enough to discourage them.
Alaska city experiences first 
sunset in months 
JUNEAU, Alaska — For the 
first time since May, the sun 
has set in what is billed as the northernmost city in the United States.
According to the National 
Weather Service, the first sunset in Barrow, Alaska, since May 10 occurred at 1:57 a.m. Friday. The sun rose again at 3:12 a.m.
Barrow has continuous day-
light for so long because of its lo-cation, hundreds of miles north of the Arctic Circle, and the tilt of 
the Earth’s axis of rotation.
The town of about 4,500 peo-
ple will gradually lose sunlight 
each day until November. After that, the sun won’t rise again un-til January — again, because of the rotational tilt.
The first sunset in months 
was a nonevent for some resi-
dents like Bob Green, an area 
resident since 1978 who didn’t stay up to watch the sunset.
“I’ve seen enough of them,” 
he said. “I’m just glad that it’s happening. I’ve had enough sun. I much prefer the winter.”
Green, reached at work at 
Pepe’s North of the Border res-
taurant, said Barrow seems to 
run better “when it’s frozen.”
There are no bugs or mud 
to deal with during the winter months, he said. Also, it’s easy to make light in the winter but hard to get rid of that “big light MONDAY SUNDAY SATURDAY FRIDAY TODAY

� AN ARBITRATOR SIDED 
AGAINST THE CITY.
HANNA MARCUS
Alligator Staff Writer hmarcus@alligator.org
The city of Gainesville’s ﬁ  ght 
against the Gainesville Renewable 
Energy Center has ended, leaving the city empty-handed.   GREC, a company that devel-
ops and operates clean energy fa-cilities, has been in negotiations with Gainesville, which attempted to buy 
part of the company. 
Gainesville originally put up 
money to buy a percentage of the 
company and claims it should have been given the ﬁ  rst offer to buy it completely. According to the order that Arbitrator Richard J. Holwell signed, Gainesville Regional Utilities accused that “GREC has effectively sold the Facility without honoring GRU’s right of ﬁ  rst offer.”
In an arbitration meeting last 
week, Holwell ruled to dismiss the city’s claim that would have required GREC to sell the plant to the city.
According to the document, Hol-
well ruled in favor of GREC because 
the purchase had to be a single trans-
action. Local activist Mark Venzke said the results shocked him. 
“I’m very disappointed that the 
arbitrator ruled in favor of GREC,” he said. “[The arbitrator] said the two selling transactions couldn’t be considered … because they were  separate transactions. That escapes me.”
GRU would not comment on 
the issue because litigation between 
GRU and GREC is still unﬁ  nished.
Albert Morales, the chief ﬁ  nancial 
ofﬁ  cer for GREC, said the outcome 
is positive, and he plans to continue working with GRU. A phone con-ference between GREC and the city is scheduled for Wednesday to at-tempt to resolve remaining issues.

Emiliano’s Café was slammed.
It was the ﬁ  rst night of Gainesville Restaurant Week 2013, 
and owner Diego Ibañez said the pan-Latin restaurant, located at 7 SE First Ave.,  was as busy as it would be on a fall day be-fore a Gators game.
In the midst of the hubbub, Ibañez received a text message. 
It was an anonymous compliment from a customer who had been in the restaurant that night.
Using Quibble, a mobile application recently developed in 
Gainesville, Ibañez was able to get the feedback texted directly from a customer. 
The purpose of the app is to allow man-
agers to respond to “quibbles,” or “small, annoying little problems,” said Matthew Donovan, product manager for Quibble’s Gainesville-based parent company, Seventh Compass.
“It wasn’t built to address really bad 
problems at a business,” Donovan said.
Retailers, property management compa-
nies and restaurants could beneﬁ  t the most from the app, he said.
“The customer experience is the most critical part,” he said. 
“A restaurateur wants to get that feedback about anything that is affecting that customer experience. We try to let that business owner know immediately.”
The direct, character-limited message gives immediate grat-
iﬁ  cation that can diminish a customer’s need to share dissat-isfaction with a particular business on social media or review sites, Donovan said.
“Suggestion boxes, comment cards — people don’t want to 
ﬁ  ll those out because it feels like you are giving the business your email address for promotions,” he said.
For the last six weeks, signs on the tables at Emiliano’s have 
featured the app, instructing customers how to share their comments digitally. Ibañez said he’d gotten more compliments than complaints.Gainesville-developed app helps customers communicate“I’m very disappointed that

A man who calls himself the old-
est African-American male to gradu-
ate from UF’s undergraduate busi-ness school will earn his degree Aug. 10.
Leslie Giscombe will receive a 
bachelor’s degree in marketing and a minor in entrepreneurship from the Warrington College of Business Ad-ministration at 49 years old.
He said his kids inspired him 
to go back to school. In 2011, he re-ceived his associate’s degree from Daytona State College. Three of his 
children earned their associate’s de-
grees that same year.
“Being able to go back to school, 
at my age and at a school like this, is like a kid in a candy store,” Gis-combe said.
He’s also the CEO of RegroupU-
SA, a nonprofit organization meant to encourage nontraditional students 
who could get lost in the crowd or 
feel disconnected from other stu-dents.
Giscombe hopes his organization 
will help other nontraditional stu-dents get back into school. 
“Nontraditional doesn’t only de-
pend on your age — it depends on your experiences,” he said.
After graduation, Giscombe plans 
to get his master’s degree and ex-pand RegroupUSA.
His son Nathaniel Giscombe, a 
financial analyst, said he’s proud of his dad.
“He always instilled that in us, to 
always go after your dreams and to challenge yourself,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, AUGUST 8, 2013

� RICK SCOTT NAMED 
UF A PRE-EMINENT UNIVERSITY IN APRIL.
BRIANNA WAGNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
The newest step in UF’s 
journey to top-10 status is 
launching an initiative to 
raise $800 million by June 
2016.
But it’s also about at-
tracting educators to give 
UF students the best pos-
sible education, said Vice President of Development and Alumni Affairs Tom Mitchell. There will be no 
student fee implemented 
to raise the money.
Most of the money is ex-
pected to come from alum-
ni and supporters.
“We have about 375,000 
alumni worldwide,” 
Mitchell said. “I am con-fident that Florida Gators 
will respond to the call of 
further strengthening their university.”Gov. Rick Scott named 
UF a pre-eminent universi-
ty in April. The university 
will match the $15 million Scott plans to give annu-ally through fundraising.
“If we can raise that 
much for football stadiums, we can do it for academ-ics,” said 23-year-old UF alumnus Fernando Carlo. 
The money will be dis-
tributed based on propos-als from each college. They essentially have to compete 
to get the funds, Mitchell 
said.
He said if UF can keep 
improving and gaining ac-knowledgment for being a 
top research facility, then 
it is more likely to receive grants in the future for more research opportuni-
ties.
Mitchell said the re-
search — which will cover 
fields ranging from citrus growth to economics — 
should also benefit Florida 
residents because it will be applicable to their lives.UF plans to raise 
$800M to hire esteemed facultyHe works with Trimark Properties and 
College Park, among others, to offer students 
discounts. UF Mover Guys is offering $25 off current rates, which begin at $175 per hour.
Speisman said planning ahead is usually 
cheaper, but sometimes waiting until the last minute can be beneficial. Like on Tuesday, when a client needed a carpet cleaned imme-diately. Speisman could charge less because the company’s schedule had an opening.
One way students can reduce moving 
costs, he said, is to pack most items them-selves.
Small boxes should be packed with heavi-
er objects like books, and lighter boxes should be filled with items like Christmas decora-tions.2 College Brothers Inc. co-founder Bryan 
Weschler said his employees relate to clients because they’re students, too. His company is partnering with Student Maid to offer stu-dents two hours of moving and two hours of cleaning, which is normally worth about $400, for about $300.
Corey Banta, a relocation specialist at 
Gator Moving & Storage, said all moving companies expect to maximize profits during 
this time.
Gator Moving & Storage charges about 
$180 for small student moves, which includes 
the hourly labor plus the fees for the van and fuel. The company offers 10 percent off labor for UF students and faculty year round.
Banta’s advice for them is to place already- 
packed boxes close to the door.
“The less work movers have to do, the 
more money students save,” he said.THURSDAY, AUGUST 8, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Soto said the question that 
determines this ranking is about the 
popularity of intercollegiate sports on 
campus. 
“We base these on the college 
experts, and those are currently 
enrolled UF students, “ Soto said. 
Soto said the results are determined 
by a five-point Likert scale to allow 
school-to-school comparisons. 
Still, the results disappoint some UF 
students. 
“If we weren’t ranked in the top five 
every weekend, students didn’t think it was worth their time, and I think that’s very poor sportsmanship,” Petry said. 
“We should be out there to support our 
boys and appreciate the tradition that is Florida football.”princeton , from page 1

Moving on, President Obama has decided to cancel a 
meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The reason: Snowden. Russia recently granted the whistleblower one-year asylum. If there’s any remedy to be found for this situation, it’s not going to be found by closing the doors of communication with Russia. How does this make us look in the eyes of other 
countries throughout the world? For taking steps in the wrong 
direction, we give President Obama a please-change-your-
mind-on-this-one DART.
Speaking of Russia, it will host the 2014 Winter Olympics in 
Sochi. In a surprising turn of events, Russia’s sports minister said that a new law forbidding “propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations” from being distributed to minors would be enforced. Gay pride rallies are banned along with TV and In-ternet expressions of this nature. Is Russia trying to prove that 
it’s just as totalitarian as many Americans make it out to be? 
Maybe. Actor George Takei recently called for the Olympics to be held in another county. Maybe this is a good idea. We give Russia an it’s-okay-to-be-gay DART.
On Snowden, his Wikipedia page was recently edited by 
a user from the U.S. Senate building. The article was revised from reading “American dissident” to “American traitor.” The change was reverted quickly by Wikipedia due to the bias of the edit. For keeping it not so classy, we give the anonymous 
user a not-on-my-Interwebs DART.

tic, it lacked some juiciness. This could be the start of a revolu-
tion in eating. For expanding human potential — and poten-tial appetite — we give professor Mark Post and his peers a 
thanks-for-all-the-meat LAUREL.
The Mars rover, Curiosity, recently hit the one-year mark of 
its mission. Already, it has found evidence that water was once ﬂ  owing on Mars, became the ﬁ  rst robot to drill into another planet, and found some of the elements that are essential for life on our own planet. For all of the hard work and advance-
ment, we give a to-Mars-and-beyond LAUREL to NASA.
Finally, we’d like to hand a LAUREL to the “Colbert Re-
port” for turning a crappy situation — getting stood up by Daft 
Punk because of his own network — into an even more hilari-ous episode featuring the *other* song of the summer, “Blurred 
Lines.” Here’s a tip of the hat to you, Stephen Colbert.
 See you next semester!
Farewell Part 2: We are stardust, realized
On Tuesday I wrote on the importance of maintain-
ing Internet freedom — if only for the most excellent ability that it gives us to spread information. I would 
like to explore this concept a little more deeply but from a different perspective.
There has been no greater joy in my life than coming to 
discover our place in the cosmos. The cosmic perspective adds so much to my life.
For aeons, we were there. We were matter in the stellar 
furnaces — the sleeping star stuff. It was you. It was me. The cigarette butt on the street, the tree that gives you the oxygen that you breathe — we were all there in the stars.
The stuff of life abounded on this planet, and the mat-
ter arranged such that it began to replicate itself. The crude 
copying process allowed for changes. 
And now here we are. We are complex assemblages of 
matter contemplating the origins of matter; stardust coming 
to understand the stars; atomic beings unlocking the hidden powers of atoms. When you really stop and think about it, it blows your mind.
All of this is true, and yet most of us rarely think about it. Such small beings are we. Such humble origins do we 
have. And now we have arisen to become alive. In this sector 
of the cosmos, we are its frontal lobes. We are the eyes and 
ears of the universe. We are a part of the cosmos, too. There’s no out there and in here. It’s all in here. We are the stars come alive!
We start out as children, we grow up and retain the mem-
ory of having lived a life, but all matter that was in you as a child probably ﬂ  ed from you long ago, and now all that’s left is a memory, a pattern of molecules in the brain. The matter ﬂ  ows from place to place and comes together only for a mo-
ment to be human.
There’s a misunderstanding that many of us share about 
human nature. Many think that our nature is to kill and to 
hurt others, but this couldn’t be. As a single species, how could it be evolutionarily advantageous for us to hate each other? Indeed, we are equipped with empathy, instead. We are social beings, and we have the capacity to take on the emotions of others.In addition to communicat-
ing with emotion, we also use language. Language is frightful in its power. It’s a reﬁ  ned mind-to-mind telepathy. It’s insane! We 
assign symbolic value to the calls 
we make, the grunts coming from our mouths, and these are our lan-guages. Minds connect, and even now as you read this, what was 
once just an idea in my mind is now in your mind.
The Internet is the current epitome of this telepathic pro-
cess. Look at your phone! We’ve outsourced our mental capacity to communicate to these devices, and now we can 
communicate with anyone in any sector of the globe if we 
have their number. It’s crazy! Matter has come to do such unusual things.
Beings so fragile, so small as we are, will venture to the 
stars. Our small, delicate planet hangs in the black, frigid depths of space, silently traveling. It’s our little home, our little spaceship. It’s the only home we’ve ever known. Here, life arose. Here we have found a place to call our own. Here is where we make our stand and do mighty works. We come 
to understand ourselves. The world of the unseen is made 
known to us. What greater story could there be?
If we’re to ever make it as far as the stars, we must ﬁ  rst 
ensure that our capacity for fearfulness and hatred, qualities which kept us alive for so long in the wild, don’t keep us from viewing humanity as it truly is: a single species. We’re all in this together, we dwellers of the third planet. Matter wanders, and we wander. We were wanderers then, and we’re wanderers still. 
I hope that we will always have the courage to confront 
ourselves head-on, to ask the tough questions, and to never be frightened of the answers.
When a mind is steeped in the truth, it adds to existence. 
Every moment spent in communion with what is true, re-newing your understanding of what you are, is a moment well spent. Farewell.

What can be better than heading down-
town for one of the largest happy hours and 
bringing your best friend — well, best furry friend — along?
On the ﬁ  rst Friday of each month, the 
Pledge 5 Foundation puts on an event with a 
different theme.
This month’s theme was “Dog Days of 
Summer,” and it encouraged participants to 
bring man’s best friend downtown from 5 - 10 
p.m. for dog-friendly fun, games and treats.
The city of Gainesville recently passed an 
ordinance that allows dogs to dine with their owners at restaurants downtown with out-door seating options.
The optional permit costs $250.
It seemed appropriate to spread the word 
by dedicating the ﬁ  rst Friday to dogs.
Among the attractions were more than 20 
dog-friendly venues, a silent auction, doggy 
ice cream and baked goods, a K-9 photo booth and a doggy awards show.
The event was a huge success, Pledge 5 
member and volunteer Regina Hogan said. 
There were at least 100 dogs and even more 
people that came out.
The ﬁ  rst Friday event included discounts 
at 30 local bars, Hogan said.
“Even if a person does not want to engage 
in the speciﬁ  c theme they can still enjoy the festivities and discounts,” Hogan said.
Haley Russell, a speech-language patholo-
gist at Shands Rehab Hospital, rolled her dog Maggie down the sidewalk in a stroller.
The adorably funny bulldog sat back in the 
shade while crowds gathered around to take pictures despite the fact that she was sporting a Georgia Bulldogs collar.  
The 8-year-old English bulldog was quite the princess, getting chauffeured around by her owners. 
“Maggie is one spoiled baby,” Haley said. “She was born on Cinco De Mayo so we 
have a party for her every year: ‘Cinco De Maggie.’”
Haley and her husband Todd Russell have 
wanted to attend First Friday for a while now, 
and once they heard it was “Dog Days of Sum-
mer,” they knew they had to go, Haley said.
UF grad student William 
Jenkins, 25, attended the event as well with his new German shepherd puppy, Arya, who is 8 weeks old and timid but feisty.
“Arya and I had such a 
great time going in and out of all the dog-
friendly venues,” Jenkins said.
“It was a great way to build her conﬁ  dence 
and socialize with other pets in a friendly en-
vironment.”
Hogan said many families were open to 
adopting new dogs, and there were several donations at the silent auction. 
“Gainesville is a city of very hospitable 
people.”
Pledge 5 is always looking for volunteers 
to pledge ﬁ  ve hours of community service to 
help out with a good cause.
If anyone is interested, contact Jason Bow-
man at Pledge 5. www.pledge5.org.

Beware, network and cable TV: 
Netﬂ  ix is climbin’ in yo windows 
and snatchin’ yo people up.
The streaming service’s two orig-
inal series proved to be formidable 
opponents to well-established net-
work shows — “House of Cards” is 
racking up Emmy nods, and, accord-ing to the Hufﬁ  ngton Post, “Orange is the New Black” was renewed for 
a second season before the ﬁ  rst sea-
son even premiered on July 11.
“Orange is the New Black,” 
based on the memoir by Piper Kerman, follows Piper Chapman, 
a white Anglo-Saxon Protestant 
(WASP), well-bred woman, as her past transgressions — becom-ing involved with an international drug-trafﬁ  cking ring with her ex-
girlfriend, played by Laura Prepon 
of “That 70s Show” — eventually catch up with her. This landed her a 15-month sentence in a minimal-
security women’s prison in upstate 
New York. 
The prison sentence puts ten-
sion on her engagement with a man, 
Jason Biggs, and her relationships 
with her fellow yuppie, creative-class friends — one of whom she co-owns a line of artisanal soaps.
The show (thankfully) isn’t lim-
ited to Chapman’s adaptation to prison culture and subsequent alien-ation from her ﬁ  ancé — a character so spineless and spongy you’ll want to reach through the TV and slap him, especially as he uses Chap-man’s sentence as a way to grow his 
career by writing a column for the 
New York Times and appearing on NPR to discuss their changing rela-tionship.
Chapman, the 
viewer comes to realize, is not the focal point of the 
show. Rather, 
she’s the jump-ing-off point for the viewer 
to experience the backgrounds of 
the other inmates, from a beautiful 
transexual woman with a crumbling family life, played by the stunning Laverne Cox, to the sharp-tongued Russian cook who runs the kitchen, to a mysterious older Haitian wom-an trailing rumors of murder. 
Each episode provides ﬂ  ashbacks 
into the lives of the inmates before their sentence, allowing the women to develop into complicated, highly 
nuanced characters rather than one-
dimensional stereotypes.
While “Orange” is a dark come-
dy, some of the scenes are poignant, 
chilling and touching. During the 
prison’s Christmas pageant, an in-mate delivers an impromptu perfor-mance of “Amazing Grace,” and the room goes silent. Chapman delivers 
a gripping philosophical monologue 
to a young delinquent about the na-ture of prison life. 
“Truth catches up with you in here,” she says as she leans in close to the girl’s face. “It’s the truth that’s going to make you hurt.”
“Orange” also passes the Bech-
del test with ﬂ  ying colors — it con-tains a multitude of named female characters across every race, age 
and sexuality, and they talk about 
things other than men. Creator Jenji Kohan, who also made Showtime’s “Weeds,” provides an array of por-
traits of women we aren’t used to 
seeing on TV: older women, wom-en of color, trans women and gay women.
One character, the sharp-tongued 
Poussey, captured the spirit of the show best in one quote: “We’re all just in here because we took a wrong turn going to church.”

� THE MOVIE WILL RELEASE 
IN THEATERS AUG. 21.
MELISSA KAHAN
Avenue Staff Writer mkahan@alligator.org
The movie industry would be 
nothing without young adult ﬁ  lms 
targeted at preteens and young moviegoers. So what does the in-dustry need? Another movie about 
a girl living a seemingly normal 
life who uncovers dark secrets about herself — in this case, in a world of angel-human, demon-killing Shadowhunters whom she teams up with after she ﬁ  nds out she is one after the disappearance of her mom. 
You know Snow White from 
the ﬁ  lm “Mirror Mirror,” aka Phil Collins’ daughter? That’s Lily Col-lins, who will play main damsel in distress Clarissa “Clary” Fray from the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  lm adaptation of “The Mortal Instruments” book series by Cassandra Clare: “City of Bones.” Alongside her, meet Jamie Campbell Bower: the British stud 
you will undoubtedly recognize 
from both “Twilight” and “Harry Potter” and as the upcoming Shad-owhunter Jace. Let’s not forget “Gossip Girl” cast member Kevin Zegers, who is ready to play Alec in this book series turned movie franchise.
Coming into this project, the 
book series is well-beloved. What kind of pressure is there to play those character roles adequately?
Lily: “Coming into this situ-ation, I was a fan of the book be-fore I was cast, and as a reader I have certain expectations of how Clary should be played. I have to 
separate myself and honor the way 
Clare [author] wrote Clary. But I had to take it on as my own as some of Lily, too. I try not to think of pressures to play this role ‘cause it would distract me. I don’t think any of us think of other pressures except the ones we put on our-selves.”
Jamie: “We can’t please ev-
erybody, but we were cast in the movie. We take what everyone has said as well as our guide — the books — and take it under consid-eration.”
For someone who doesn’t know 
about the books, what about the story threw you guys in and told you that you wanted to do it?
Kevin: “I hadn’t read the books 
like Lily, so she had reason why she wanted to do it. I just read the script and thought it was really good. To be honest, I found myself 
really surprised at how character-
driven it was. The supernatural stuff is in there, but it’s not reliant on it. Any preconceived notion you’d have, it was still just a good ﬁ  lm.”
Jamie: “There are no empty 
characters. What I was excited 
about was changing the image. 
Throughout recent history we’ve seen the male superhero or love in-terest as this big beefcake and un-touchable, kind of like Kevin, and I was excited to kind of redeﬁ  ne that and be like a wily rock star, and that’s what I think I was able to do. In my experience, that’s what teen-
age girls are into.”
Lily: “This was the ﬁ  rst time I 
felt like reality and fantasy were 
married together so well. It has re-alness. Yeah, there’s romance, but it doesn’t deﬁ  ne what this book is. There’s drama and action — some of the best action I’ve seen in a long 
time, let alone in a teen franchise. 
Doesn’t matter that it’s geared to-ward teenagers, it would be just a good ﬁ  lm.”
What does this 
mean for your careers that you have to invest in 
these characters 
for another few years at least be-cause of the fran-chise?
Lily: “What’s great about this 
for us is that it’s not our ﬁ  rst ﬁ  lms.  So we’ve done stuff before, and 
we don’t have to be typecast. We 
have been able to show different sides of our personalities, and it goes so many different places in a series. I signed on ‘cause I wanted to play Clary as long as I could. It’s an honor to continue to play Clary and experience this as her.”
Kevin: “It’s a little more dif-
ﬁ  cult when you’re introduced to people, and they haven’t seen you in anything besides that one ﬁ  lm. The good news for us is we love this story, and the longer we get to be a part of the franchise is great for our careers. This is not intended to be a last thing that any of us do — 
we’re young and ambitious. Jamie 
has music, and Lily and I have so many things. As a 28-year-old guy, I saw the ﬁ  lm a couple weeks ago and was impressed. It’s not just for 14-year-old girls, and the two hours watching it ﬂ  ew by.”
Jamie: “What’s great for all of 
us is this is hopefully not going to pigeonhole us in a way. But I could be totally wrong. If this is going on for ﬁ  ve or six years, it means I get to work with my best friends again. I look forward to it. I’ve done mov-ies where I thought it was going to be more, but you always have to prepare yourself for no.”
Would you say the fantasy 
genre really attracts you?
Jamie: “I’m English so I’m al-
ways cast as the weirdo or as some-thing wrong with them (chuckles). That is how my career has gone. Let’s be honest: You look at the 
movie industry and it is in a little 
bit of trouble. They have to make movies people want to see, so do-ing a movie with a book that has over 22 million readers is a pretty safe bet. I feel lucky ‘cause there have been adaptations not as good as this. People like fantasy because they like to be taken away from 
mundane elements of life.”
Lily: “I love fantasy; that’s why 
doing ‘Snow White’ previously 
was a big deal, but this movie is edgier and darker and sexier — something I didn’t ﬁ  nd in the other ones. Taking people away into fan-tasy: That’s like my job.”
Given so many adaptations 
of so many books in the series, closing in on seven books of the “Mortal” series, are you commit-ted to commit to them?
Jamie: “Yeah, we committed to 
be committed (chuckles). We have 
to be. When I got into this, I obvi-
ously was aware that it could go on. We have to focus job by job or movie by movie, and if we do go on, who knows how many we’ll have to do. I don’t know if I can play Jace, who’s 19, when I’m 34. If I could, great, but I doubt it. In that sense, we have to focus job by 
job.”
Kevin: “There’s a funny saying: 
We plan, god laughs. All I know 
now is we’re on this press tour, and I’m hanging out with good friends. We’re starting ﬁ  lming for the second movie in September. Who knows, they could hate me in 
the second one and re-cast. I think 
we all come from the same place, and that we’re all grateful.”
Lily: “As long as people will 
have me as Clary, I’ll do it. It would be a shame to stop prematurely. I don’t want people to feel they’ve been gypped of certain things.”
Jamie: “Do we have any say? 
Some of us, but it has to be that connection, ya know?”

The Jonas Brothers’ return to Florida 
was triumphant — and deafening.
Thousands of teenage girls welcomed 
the pop-rock band back to the stage last 
week in West Palm Beach’s Cruzan Am-phitheatre. 
The recently reunited brothers are tour-
ing the U.S. after releasing new music for the first time in four years, and if the screams Friday night were any indication, fans are thrilled they’re back.
But the men performing at the concert 
were not the boys UF students may re-member from 2009.
“We grow up as well,” 25-year-old 
Kevin Jonas told me in a phone interview earlier that day. “We’ve progressed musi-cally — the sound — but at the same, the way our content ... you know, there’s a lot 
of things we wouldn’t have talked about 
in the past or stories we wouldn’t have told in our music ... This time around, that doesn’t even exist.”
The show Friday wove those mature, 
no-longer-shackled-by-Disney elements together with staples from the band’s ear-ly years. The set list was interspersed with throwback hits and brand-new songs from 
their upcoming album.
The brothers opened with “First Time,” 
the new single from their to-be-announced 
album “V,” but followed it with 2009’s “Paranoid.” Then came “Pom Poms,” an-
other recent, innuendo-filled single from the new CD.
When the fans didn’t know the words 
(for example when the band played songs like “Fall,” “The World” or “What Do I 
Mean to You”), they simply cheered — and shrieked — along.
“It’s incredible to see that our fans 
[have] stayed with us, and stuck with us, and grown with us,” Jonas said.
The show also made references to the 
time the brothers spent apart. Over the 
past few years, 20-year-old Nick Jonas and 
23-year-old Joe Jonas explored solo proj-ects.
Friday, they cleverly altered songs like 
“Who I Am” and “See No More” from 
those independent albums so the three 
could perform them together.
Despite the band’s break, their per-
formance was stronger than ever. They 
danced across stage, played multiple in-
struments and ignited the audience with questions like “Are you feeling sexy to-night?”
Yet through it all, the brothers appeared 
to stay humble, shooting each other glanc-es as if to say “Can you believe this?”
The show closed out with fan-favorite 
“Burnin’ Up,” and the crowd’s cheers 
brought the boys back to the stage for two 
encore songs: “Lovebug” and “S.O.S.”
As the brothers said their final good-
byes, I saw a girl, maybe 14, excitedly pulling up her shirt to flash the brothers 
her white cotton bra. A venue worker was 
frantically trying to convince her to pull it down.
“What are you thinking?” the worker 
yelled.
It wasn’t too hard to guess. After all, 
Joe had voiced the sentiment earlier in the night.
“We’re so happy to be back,” he said.THURSDAY, AUGUST 8, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

you like to get some Mediocre Advice? Visit http://mediocreadvicegators.tumblr.com/ask
Ariel BarnesDear Mediocre Advice,
I love my friends, but sometimes I feel 
like they don’t care about the things I 
have to say. I feel that they’re judgmen -
tal of my actions. I don’t like to hide things from them, but it’s hard to keep them in the loop if I feel like they’re not 
even listening. What should I do?
Dear Friend,
You don’t have to tell your friends ev -
erything you do. If they do not approve of 
whatever aspect of your life that makes you happy, just don’t tell them. It’s okay to keep your personal business to yourself, especially if you think you may be judged. Whether you’re sleeping with someone they may not approve of or you’re friends with someone they don’t like, sometimes it’s all right to keep secrets. This isn’t “Mean Girls.” If they have a problem with how you want to live your life — whatever it is that 
you’re doing — they don’t have to know. 
Branch out and make new friends.
Dear Mediocre Advice,
Is it true that if you don’t use 
it ... you lose it?
Dear Friend,
This seemed like a vague ques -
tion. To avoid any confusion, I have 
made two separate lists.
Here is a list of a few things you 
will lose if you do not use:
1.      Coupons2.      Booty call opportunities3.      Food (it will expire)4.      Your job5.      Your body6.      Your boner
Here is a list of things you will not 
lose if you do not use:
1.      Your penis
2.      Your vagina3.      Your butt4.      Parental advice5.      Magazine subscriptionsDear Mediocre Advice,
How do you know when you cross the line be -
tween kinky and just plain weird in the bedroom?
Dear Friend,
To me, the realm of weird involves animal costumes 
and murder. What you may consider weird in the bed -
room is purely based off of what you’re comfortable with 
or what you expect from someone. People have differ -
ent preferences. Some like ass-smacking, and some like whispering weird cannibalistic things in their part -
ner’s ear. This is why there is such a thing as a safe 
word. People are weird, and that’s okay.
Dear Mediocre Advice,
What is the best patriotic accessory one can have?
Dear Friend,
I am the proud owner of several patriotic accessories —  down 
to underwear. My secret is I have no shame. My favorites are 
items that say “‘Merica,” such as a vest, headband or a muscle tee. If you want to yell “‘MURICA” like bloody murder, I suggest pants that look like the material was ripped off your local elemen -
tary school flag pole. I have yet to add that to my wardrobe. Do not fear the faux pas that you cannot wear more than one Ameri -
can flag print at a time. I’ve done it, and you can, too.

HEAD COUCH AT KENTUCKY.
PHIL HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer 
Since accepting the job as Flor-
ida’s wide receivers coach and re-
cruiting coordinator on Dec. 3, Joker 
Phillips has garnered attention for 
utilizing Photoshop to reach out to high school prospects. 
Gators offensive coordinator 
Brent Pease said Phillips has also be-
come an integral part in the much-
needed development of UF’s pass-ing attack. 
“He’s challenged our kids at the 
wide receiver position,” Pease said Wednesday. “You bring a guy that 
has that much experience in, and 
you look at his reputation, and he 
gives you that authority figure that 
knows what’s going on.”
Florida’s feeble passing game 
was a blemish in an otherwise strong 
season that saw the Gators go 11-2 
and earn a berth in the Sugar Bowl 
against Louisville. 
The Gators finished last in the 
Southeastern Conference in passing 
yardage, averaging 146.3 yards per game. Kentucky and Auburn — two teams that combined to go 0-16 in the SEC last season — each passed for more yards in 2012. 
Quinton Dunbar, who led the 
Gators with four receiving touch-
downs last season and projects to 
be one of quarterback Jeff Driskel’s biggest targets in 2013, said a lack of 
continuity has been a major issue for 
Florida’s offense. 
“Since I’ve been here, I’ve done 
had three different [offensive] co-
ordinators, so we never really got a 
grasp of the offense,” Dunbar said 
at UF media day. “Coming in their first year, they don’t want to throw a 
boatload at you, so you don’t really 
get the whole playbook.
“Coming into the second year, I 
feel like we’re going to open it up.”
Phillips offers a level of experi-
ence that was missing at the receiv-
ers coach position last season, which should only make Pease’s job easier. 
Prior to serving as head coach of 
Kentucky from 2010 to 2012, Phil-lips spent time as wide receivers 
coach at Cincinnati (1997), Minne-
sota (1999-2000), Notre Dame (2001), 
South Carolina (2002) and Kentucky 
(2003-2009). 
Bush Hamdan, a former graduate 
assistant, was thrust into the open position on an interim basis when Aubrey Hill resigned last August. 
With Phillips on staff, Pease now 
has the flexibility to spend more time with other position groups.“At times, he’ll take some things 
over,” Pease said of Phillip’s duties 
in practice. “I’ll either stay with the 
quarterbacks or with the run game 
when they’re doing one-on-one be-cause he knows how to manage the 
drills.”
The infusion of several talented 
freshman receivers could also pro-vide an immediate boost to the of-
fense. Demarcus Robinson, Ahmad 
Fulwood and Alvin Bailey each proj-
ect to factor into the passing game. 
Latroy Pittman and Raphael An-
drades, who had modest results as 
true freshmen last season, also re-
turn. As does Solomon Patton, who 
suffered a broken arm in Florida’s 17-9 loss to Georgia on Oct. 29. 
While Pease noted, “Our game 
is we’re going to wear them down up front,” he admitted stretching 
the field vertically is an element that 
must improve. 
As Florida prepares for its season 
opener against Toledo on Aug. 31, 
Pease believes he sees a difference 
in the team’s group of receivers, a 
product of Phillips’ hard work. 
“He’s done a good job of estab-
lishing his standards in the room,” Pease said, “and what he expects from them and how they approach 
practice each day.”

After failing to live up to his immense 
potential during his college career, An-
dre Debose entered the 2013 season hop-ing to make the most of his final oppor-
tunity. 
With one misstep, his season is fin-
ished. 
Debose suffered a torn ACL in his left 
knee during Tuesday’s practice and will 
require surgery, according to a UF press release. The redshirt senior expected to start at kick returner for the Gators and was in the mix for a starting job at re-ceiver. 
“I know that Andre is disappointed,” 
coach Will Muschamp said. “He had been doing very well in camp and we were more than pleased with his effort and attitude. Andre was hurt in a non-contact situation. He just planted his foot and there was a tear.”
Debose, who was once compared to Percy Harvin by former UF coach Ur-ban Meyer, has only 29 receptions for 543 yards and four touchdowns in his career. 
His biggest contri-
bution to the program 
has come as a kick re-turner. Debose holds the school record with four return touch-downs and is second in Southeastern Con-ference history with 
an average of 27.4 yards per kick return.
“It is unfortunate and you feel bad 
anytime that someone is injured,” Mus-champ said. “The coaching staff and our team will be very supportive in assisting Andre during his recovery.”
Debose received a medical redshirt 
following the 2009 season. He can peti-tion the NCAA for a sixth year of college eligibility.

With probable starters 
Jon Halapio (partially torn 
pectoral muscle) and Max 
Garcia (back) out due to in-
jury, Florida needs someone to fill big holes in the offen-sive line.
Fortunately for UF of-
fensive coordinator Brent Pease, they don’t come much bigger than Trenton Brown.
The 6-foot-8, 363-pound 
junior college transfer is drawing Pease’s attention at his first Florida training camp.
“He’s the biggest kid I’ve 
ever seen out there,” Pease said on Wednesday. “He’s big, he’s strong, and he can move, so he’s going to be a 
real good football player.”Brown played two years 
at Georgia Military Col-lege, where he was named 
a second-team NJCAA All-American, before transfer-ring to Florida. Rivals.com rated him as a three-star 
prospect.
Pease said Brown is 
working on his condition-
ing to get in shape for the 
upcoming season.
“He hasn’t been in that 
situation and been here long 
enough,” he said. “He’s get-
ting there. Our guys are 
making him work.”
Defenders move to full-
back: Two former defensive players, Gideon Ajagbe and Rhaheim Ledbetter, are get-
ting reps at fullback in fall 
camp.
Ledbetter, a safety, did 
not play last season and earned a redshirt. He came 
to Florida as a three-star re-
cruit, according to Rivals.com.
Ajagbe made four ap-
pearances at linebacker in 2011, but did not see any field time last season. 
“He’s very unselfish and 
willing to say, ‘Hey, I’m go-
ing to make these tailbacks 
1,000-yard rushers,’” Pease said. “I think Gideon, in the long run, will become a guy that is very versatile for us 
because he’s got that tight 
end-type body, and yet he can still be a fullback.”

THE ALLIGATOR AWARDS
  Adam: The best thing about 
sports is that you can go to any ran-
dom game and witness something 
you’ve never seen before. I went to a spring training game one year 
and saw a third-string catcher hit 
an inside-the-park home run (well, I should have seen it, but that’s an-
other story).
  Sometimes we’re lucky enough 
to see an extraordinary feat of ath-leticism, something that people 
will talk about for days or weeks or months.
  And for UF baseball, that per-
formance was Zack Powers’ two-grand-slam game against Duke on 
Feb. 17.
  Think about it. Two swings of 
the bat. Eight runs. It’s uncommon to see one grand slam, but two in 
one game is nuts. And he drove in another run on a sac ﬂ  y.
  Powers powered (pun intend-
ed) Florida to a 16-5 blowout, one of the best Gators performance in 
an otherwise mediocre season.
  Phil: If a ﬁ  rst baseman clubs 
two grand slams in one game and nobody is there to see it, did it re-
ally happen? 
  Okay, that was a bit unfair. 
Florida’s baseball team gets plenty of support, and deservedly so, the Gators have perennially been one 
of the nation’s best teams. 
  However, the program was dec-
imated by the MLB draft and never got things going last year. 
Powers’ performance was 
impressive, but it was quick-
ly forgotten. Erik Murphy’s night against Wisconsin was 
the start of greatness.
  Murphy drained all 10 of 
his shots — becoming just 
the 18th player in South-eastern Conference history 
to not miss a shot in a game while 
attempting at least 10 ﬁ  eld goals —
en route to scoring 24 points in the 
Gators’ 74-56 victory against the Badgers. 
  After three seasons marred by 
an arrest and up-and-down perfor-mances on the court, Murphy an-
nounced his presence as one of the 
nation’s most efﬁ  cient scorers. And he did it all just days after suffer-
ing from massive migraines. That’s 
Jordan-esque.
    A d a m :  If it was Jordan-esque, it would have 
been in March, not November. It was a great game, but great games happen all the time.
  The last time a Florida player 
hit two grand slams in a game was when Preston Tucker launched two 
into the seats in 2009. Not exactly a 
common occurrence. 
  It’s not Powers’ fault the Gators 
struggled. And if you want to talk about overcoming adversity, then Powers is your guy. He missed the 
entire 2012 season due to shoulder 
surgery.
  And what does he do in his third game in nearly two years? Launch two grand slams in 
what was probably the best 
game of his career. 
  When he came back like 
Jordan, wearing just the ﬁ  ve, it wasn’t to play games with you, it was to aim for the fences. 
  Phil: Powers wasn’t aiming 
too hard for the fences considering he hit just one more home run the 
rest of the season. 
  You know what that tells me? 
His one game was a ﬂ  uke. An out-lier. Not to be repeated. 
  And life doesn’t reward one-
time wonders, Lichtenstein. Just ask Marky Mark and the Funky 
Bunch. Never heard of them? Ex-actly.
  While Powers was busy hitting 
.268 on the season — not exactly 
spectacular — Murphy ﬁ  nished 
the season second on the team with 12.2 points per game. He also grabbed eight rebounds against 
Wisconsin and became a solid in-
side threat with an array of moves in his arsenal that kept defenders 
off-balance. 
  And he did it all with the bright 
lights of ESPN illuminating the O’Dome. A performance that won’t 
soon be forgotten.
  Adam: I actually have heard of 
Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. They had the hit song “Good Vibra-tions,” and Powers was feeling the 
good vibrations back in February.
  Even if Powers didn’t have a 
great season, he had one incredible game that isn’t likely to be repli-
cated any time soon. 
Face it, grand slams are awe-
some.

� OWNER STEPHEN ROSS 
SEARCHING FOR NEW CEO.
  THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
  
  DAVIE, Fla.  — For an owner 
who has endured four consecutive 
losing seasons, Miami Dolphins boss Stephen Ross sounded re-markably patient Wednesday.
  He resisted any temptation to 
say he expected a double-digit win total or playoff berth this year, even after committing about $150 million to free-agent acquisitions over the offseason.
  “You want to bring back the 
winning tradition. You want to see 
progress,” Ross said. “I want to see 
growth in the team in building the foundation for this season and fu-ture seasons. I don’t want to be a one-shot wonder.”
    With the season opener a month 
away, Ross also spoke at a news conference to discuss the state of the franchise. 
    Ross believes the Dolphins have 
found a long-term solution at quar-
terback in Ryan Tannehill, who led 
Miami to a 7-9 record while starting all 16 games as a rookie last season.
  “In pro football you need to have a great quarterback,” Ross said. “We certainly believe and hope we’ve selected that quarterback. I love the guy. I think he’s the right person to lead the way.”
    Ross said the Dolphins are for-
mulating a new proposal for up-grades, which the NFL has said are needed if the Super Bowl is to re-turn to Miami. Ross declined to say whether he would target the 2014 Legislature with the new plan, or whether it would require approval in Tallahassee.
  “We’re exploring everything,” 
he said. “Have I given up? The an-swer is no. The importance of the team, the importance of bringing marquee events to Miami is para-
mount.”
    Ross said the search for a new 
CEO will be narrowed to four can-
didates in the next week or so, with a hiring expected around Sept. 1. He said the person chosen would likely have a background in sports.   
 Dolphins look to build winning team, upgrade stadium
“We’ve got to make it 
work.”
