The Progress Party was not dis-
qualified Wednesday night by Stu-
dent Government’s Elections Com-mission, but they will have to dish out $80.Of the 13 complaints filed against 
the Progress Party, 12 were voted valid.                                                                      
Progress Party President Josh 
Simmons went head-to-head with Orange and Blue Party Sen. Sam Miorelli, who filed the complaints, when the commission meeting con-tinued after being cut short on Mon-
day night.                                                                                                
Miorelli presented eight com-
plaints to convince the commission 
that the Progress Party was in vio-lation for campaigning before Jan. 27. Violations include a premature Web site, Facebook group, Facebook message and political rally held in 
the Plaza of the Americas.                                   
During the two-and-a-half-hour 
meeting, Simmons and Miorelli pre-
sented evidence and refuted each other’s claims. In the end, the Prog-ress Party was fined.
“The Progress Party understands they made a large mistake,” said 
Michael Maguire, a member of the 
commission.
But Miorelli disagreed.“I think what came out of this 
shows you can campaign outside the election season,” he said. “And that’s deplorable.”

UF President Bernie Machen’s salary may 
be  lowered if the U.S. Treasury Department 
extends its new guidelines to university presi-
dents. On Feb. 4, the department tried to cap 
top executives’ salaries at some companies to  $500,000 in order to ameliorate the nation’s financial crisis, according to a Chronicle of 
Higher Education article released last week.
Although the new regulations are directed 
at corporations receiving federal bailout fund-ing, some believe they may eventually affect universities, according to the article.                   
This might put university presidents’ sala-
ries at risk. Machen’s 2008 salary of $731,811 made him Florida’s highest-paid public uni-
versity president.
However, UF spokesman Steve Orlando 
said the possibility 
was only based on speculation, adding that Machen has a 
base salary of $220,000. The rest comes from bonuses and private funds from UF’s Athletic Association and Shands at UF. 
He said if UF were to be compared to a cor-
poration, then Machen would be in charge of 24,000 employees and about a $4-billion bud-get. This does not including the 51,000 or so students who attend UF, Orlando said.
He added that UF produces $7 billion for 
the state economy through sports and re-search.Machen may face salary cut under Treasury’s new rulesBy THomAS STeWART

Though the $75,000 salary of state Sen. Mike Haridopolos, 
hired last spring as a lecturer at UF, drew criticism because it eclipsed most others in the political science department, it turns out UF approached him in the fall about teaching a semi-nar, which would have bumped his salary even higher.
Haridopolos, R-Indiatlantic, said he turned the offer down, 
but not because of the controversy.
“The idea was brought up, and I quickly came to the con-
clusion that my plate was full, and we moved on,” he said. It is unclear how much more he would have been paid.
While Haridopolos does not have a Ph.D., 
he makes more than 28 of the 37 professors 
and lecturers on the political science depart-ment payroll. All but one of those faculty 
members have earned Ph.D.s, according to 
UF’s Web site. 
The only other faculty member who has 
not earned a Ph.D. is paid about $27,000.
Haridopolos, who taught three classes 
last semester and is currently teaching 10 
students in Tallahassee, said he is working on his doctorate at Florida State University. He said Graham was looking to hire someone with experience as a lawmaker and a teacher.
He said he has a unique perspective and has gotten positive 
feedback from students, who gave him an average overall rat-ing of 4.5 out of 5 for two of his classes last semester.
Haridopolos said he’s been teaching for 15 years, mostly at 
Brevard Community College, and said he looked forward to teaching at UF again next year. Lecturer/Sen.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Moving with lightning speed, 
key lawmakers announced an agreement Wednesday on a 
$789 billion economic stimulus measure designed to create millions of jobs in a nation reeling from recession.
The bill includes help for victims of the recession in the 
form of unemployment benefits, food stamps, health cov-erage and more, as well as billions for states that face the prospect of making deep cuts in their own programs.
It also preserves Obama’s signature tax cut — a break 
for millions of lower and middle income taxpayers, includ-ing those who don’t earn enough to pay income taxes.Haridopolos

A Gainesville man was arrested Mon-
day and charged with stealing money in 
order to raise his ranking in the United 
Blood Nation, a gang more commonly 
known as the Bloods.
On Feb. 2, a woman reported her wallet 
stolen from her car while she was at Wal-greens at 1615 NW 13th St.
According to the Gainesville Police De-
partment arrest report, the woman told police her stolen credit card had been used to wire money through Western Union, a 
money transferring business.
After an investigation of Western Union 
Financial Services, officials found that 
$1,400 of the woman’s money was wired 
to Pedro Hernandez, 24.Hernandez and Xavi-
er Parker, 24, were both 
arrested and charged 
with burglary, theft and fraudulent use of a cred-

Hernandez told po-
lice that he and Parker 
stole the wallet that had 
$1,000 in cash and various credit cards.According to the report, Hernandez 
said Parker told him he could wire the money into Hernandez’s account and that they arranged to split the money.
Hernandez said that he is required to 
pay dues to the Bloods with the money he makes from criminal activity, which would raise his status within the gang, the report stated.

UF can add one more title to 
its list after a recent study ranked 
it among the top 10 most popular 
colleges in the U.S.
Each university was ranked by 
its 2007 yield, which is the per-centage of students who elected 
to attend the school out of the 
number of students who were ac-cepted.
A lower yield indicates the 
university is frequently a second choice for students or a safety school, according to a study from U.S. News & World Report.
A high yield shows students 
are strongly motivated to go 
there, according to the report.
UF grabbed the No. 10 spot 
with 63 percent of accepted stu-
dents choosing to attend in the 
fall of 2007.
It beat out opponents like the 
University of Georgia, which 
came in at No. 20, and The Ohio State University, at No. 25.
Harvard took the No. 1 spot, with nearly 80 percent of stu-dents who were accepted choos-
ing to enroll. Brigham Young 
University and 
the University 
of Nebraska took second and third place.
UF spokes-
man Steve Or-lando said he 
believes UF will keep a top spot on the list because the number of 
applicants continues to rise from year to year.
In 2008 alone, 28,000 students 
applied and 10,000 were accept-
ed, Orlando said, adding the UF admissions board set a goal of 
wanting 6,600 students to attend 
UF the following fall. 
“(The amount of applicants) 
continues to get higher because 
(UF) becomes more and more 
competitive each year,” he said.
UF freshman Scott Schumach-
er said he thought UF’s rise in popularity could stem from the 
success its sports teams are hav-ing.
He also said its reputation in 
academics is another reason ad-
missions have become so com-petitive.
Schumacher, from Tampa, 
said about half of his friends who applied were not accepted.
Orlando said there is a down-
side to being so popular.
“With all the recent budget 
cuts, if we remain popular we may not be able to give students what they came here for,” he 
said.UF ranks No. 10 in study of nation’s popular colleges
n THE CITY HAS PLANNED 121
PROJECTS COSTING OVER $860M.
By HUNTER SIZEMORE

Gainesville is hungry for a slice of 
Obama’s $789-billion stimulus pie.
The city government has compiled a list 
of 121 projects, totaling over $860 million, that are ready to go but have no funding.
Projects range from a $125,000 remedia-tion of Depot Park to a $48-million reloca-tion of Gainesville Regional Utility’s opera-tion center.
One of the stimulus plan’s major goals 
is to fund municipal projects, which will put cash into the economy immediately.                                  On Wednesday, Congress finalized the eco-nomic stimulus package, which will be di-vided between businesses, state and local governments and tax payers. The Senate and House will vote on it soon, and the bill could be on the president’s desk in days.
But details on how the stimulus will work are scarce.
How cash will be distributed to local 
governments, what types of projects will be 
funded and the amount of money available are all questions that will be answered in the near future.
Diane Wilson, a Gainesville Regional 
Utilities analyst, was willing to share her wish list.
“$40 million would be great to have,” she 
said. “But that would be tough to get.”Wilson speculates that the stimu-
lus package could bring between 50 and 500 jobs to the Gainesville community.                                            While what projects get funded will be de-termined by the focus of the package, City Commissioner Jeanna Mastrodicasa has one favorite picked out.
“If there is an opportunity to build the 
Depot Avenue project, I’m particularly ex-cited about that,” she said.                                           
Plans to build a park in the low-income 
area have been in the works for years, she said.
Gainesville hopes for cut of stimulus to fund projects

Today’s question: Do you think 
guns have a place in schools?Wednesday’s question: Would you buy a Snuggie?
169 TOTAL VOTES28% YES72% NOColumn
Deal or No Deal
Education takes a 
backseat to progress
It’s Just A Game Guns have a rightful place in schools
A Gainesville teacher was arrested on Monday after 
he was found to be in possession of two loaded firearms — a small one in his pocket and a larger 
one in his car.
The teacher, Mark Stockdale, was being investigated 
for a battery charge that allegedly occurred the night be-fore. We have no idea what Stockdale’s motives were, but we do know his crime. He was charged with two felonies for having concealed handguns at his school.
My question is why are we so concerned about people 
bringing guns to school?
Guns are not bad per se. Guns are tools of self protec-
tion. Some estimates place the number of times people use a gun for self-defense as high as two million a year. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution protects the individual right to keep and bear firearms.
Guns are only bad when they are used to hurt the in-
nocent. Simply having a gun in your possession does not mean that you are planning to use one illegally. 
Then we come to the question of schools. We remember 
the horrible tragedies at Virginia Tech and Columbine and want to do everything we can to stop recurrences, so we think that banning guns in school will reduce crime.
It’s already illegal to shoot a gun at an innocent per-
son, so how will banning the presence of guns at school keep us from doing this? If someone plans to commit mur-der, charging them for gun possession isn’t going to deter them.
What a gun ban is going to deter is someone who plans 
to use it for self-defense. Without good people carrying guns for self-defense, the only people who have guns are criminals. A perpetrator with a handgun can fire the weapon well before police arrive. Seung-Hui Cho went on a rampage for nine minutes at Virginia Tech before police arrived.
The only way we can stop crimi-
nals from using guns is to let good people have guns, too.
Concealed weapons permits al-
low people to carry completely hid-den guns on their person for self-de-fense. These permits require training to obtain, and carriers are highly unlikely to commit a crime (one out 
350,000 carriers was convicted for homicide, according to 
a study done from 1987 to 1997). 
But, wouldn’t it be unsafe to have thousands walking 
around with guns in our schools? No. Only those over 21 
and trained could carry a firearm. The weapons would be concealed and only used in the event of a true emergency. 
Criminals fearing for their lives would be deterred by just 
knowing that guns could be present, and if criminals are 
still crazy enough to start shooting, they could be quickly taken down before they do nearly as much damage as they otherwise might.
I’m not sure of the intentions of Stockdale, but just car-
rying a firearm at school should not be a felony. Trained, well-intentioned carriers are the only thing that can pre-vent a tragedy from becoming a massacre. Criminals know this, and hence, so many massacres occur in gun-free zones like schools and post offices.
How many lives could have been saved if a trained 
teacher at Columbine had a gun? 
We will never know the answer, nor will we see any 
tragedy prevented, so long as we continue to allow crimi-nals to monopolize guns.
Johnathan Lott is a political science and economics sopho-
more. His column appears on Thursdays. The Editorial Board 
loves playing practi-cal jokes on each other 
during our rare moments of free time.
From arranging prank 
phone calls to the newsroom asking for “muffin” to writ-ing fake love notes on Sub-way napkins, we certainly know how to illicit a good chuckle from time to time.
While we’ll even go as far 
as to “misplace” someone’s 
budget sheet, the Editorial 
Board knows better than to lose our sacred copy of “Goldeneye” for Nintendo 64.
But as much as we love 
007 (we heart multi-player), we certainly don’t grab our co-workers by the throat and 
bash their heads on a desk if 
we can’t find the game.
Sadly, one resident of 
Gainesville has taken his gaming obsession way too far.According to a Gainesville 
Sun article, a 26-year-old man was arrested for beat-ing a 10-year-old boy after a dispute over a missing video 
game.
We assume the child lost 
the man’s favorite game, 
causing the man to allegedly grab the child by his throat and hit his head repeatedly against a dresser.
Fortunately, the boy did 
not require medical atten-
tion and can now play to 
his heart’s content while his attacker faces criminal charges.
What makes the story 
even more absurd is the fact that the game in question was apparently for the origi-nal PlayStation system.
While Nintendo 64 has 
achieved hipster-chic status, we have one bit of advice for this violent video game vil-lain — 1994 just called, they want their technology back.Wednesday afternoon brought word from Washing-
ton of an oh-so-close deal on the proposed eco-nomic stimulus package.
Hold your horses.While the House of Representatives and Senate reached 
a general agreement on the terms of the bill in the early eve-ning, differences remained over the inclusion of $10 billion of added support for the nation’s schools.
Specifically, members of the House were concerned over 
a portion of the package designated for the construction and renovation of public schools.
Even though the Senate’s version of the bill included the 
same monetary funds, the House’s legislation would have provided the financial support much sooner and explicitly 
for schools with the most need.
In a late-breaking announcement on Wednesday, both the 
House and Senate agreed on a final bill to present to Presi-
dent Barack Obama for his signature — sans funding for school construction.
The Editorial Board is pleased to hear that a deal is finally 
in place — bound to help remedy the country’s economic situation. But we are disappointed that the House’s attempts to keep language in the bill regarding assistance for construc-tion on schools fell through.
Sadly, under the latest version of the legislation, those 
rat-infested, asbestos-ridden schools of America lost out on a second chance.
At least Obama will most likely meet his goal of signing 
the bill into legislation on President’s Day — at the expense of education.

Letters to the Editor
UF shouldn’t punish students for DUIs
In reference to Wednesday’s article about 
DUIs, I was encouraged that the rate has, at the 
moment, decreased. However, I was appalled to learn that a student who is dumb enough to receive a DUI not only faces charges from the 
government but has to submit themselves to 
UF’s discipline. 
What right does a public school have to 
judge your actions outside of school? I can understand if the act is committed on campus, but if a student commits a crime outside of UF, UF should stay out of the matter. I understand that we represent UF and the bad publicity DUIs warrant, but what about when teachers have their scandals? Do the students receive any compensation for attending the school with the cocaine-trading teacher or with the English professor who forgot what plagiarism 
was? Not only is this single act of UF invasive, 
it leads down a slippery slope. The main rea-
son UF has to punish us for our acts outside of campus is that we represent the university. Well, what if a student is a Nazi or Racist? These groups could tarnish UF’s reputation, and if UF took the same logic as with the DUI, it wouldn’t allow any undesirable into the school. And that, my friends, is wrong. 
It is illegal. It is unacceptable. UF, as well as a large number of other universities, tries to keep its reputation as high as possible, but stay out of our lives because they are not your concern. 
We pay you to go here; you do not pay us. 
Either take our money (please spend it wisely) or do not. But please concern yourself with schooling matters, not personal ones.

Many fans are quick to say 
the game of baseball is be-
ing ruined and degraded 
by the use of steroids. 
The fact is the game was being 
ruined, but the serious stance Major 
League Baseball has taken ever since 
is restoring the glory to the game.  
Remember, the reason why ste-
roid testing didn’t occur sooner was 
because of disputes between the players’ union and owners.’
Certain players were trying to 
preserve their positions and weren’t 
willing to own up to what they had 
been doing for who knows how 
long.  
As reluctant as they were to al-
low testing, players are finally re-deeming themselves of their fault. Exposing Alex Rodriguez for using 
performance enhancers was sup-posed to be a crushing blow, but it my eyes it’s a reawakening of hon-
esty in baseball.  
I am a lifelong New York Yan-
kees fan — one who fits in the cat-
egory “never liked A-Rod.” He was arrogant, choked during the clutch 
and epitomized owner George 
Steinbrenner’s shortsightedness of 
buying hitters instead of building 
a team like the Yankees of the late ‘90s.  
His interview, however, showed 
a whole new side to him and, in 
my eyes, redeemed himself. Here’s 
a man who fell victim to a super-
charged industry where a hall-
of-fame performance is expected season after season. He made a deci-
sion to use illegal substances, and it burned him.  
But unlike the player who is us-ing until the 
point he gets caught and then says he 
is sorry, A-Rod stopped, on his own, 
five years prior to anyone even be-ing able to know what he had done. 
People who use until they’re caught 
are simply sorry they got caught, flat 
out. 
They are sorry for the embarrass-
ment and the judgment that will be passed upon them, but they are not 
sorry for using. A man who upon 
his own will stops before that point 
is genuinely repentant. He made a 
personal decision uninfluenced by 
the media or fans or anyone. There are no ulterior motives to speculate 
about. 
All this has led me to change my 
mind about A-Rod. The inhuman baseball behemoth comes across as 
a human, with strengths and weak-
nesses and a need for some support.  If other athletes come forward and drop the arrogant and defensive BS, 
maybe people will learn to embrace them for their honesty.
People shouldn’t idolize players 
just because they lead the league in 
home runs, or they might get their 
hearts broken to learn who they re-ally are.  That’s as superficial as girls 
who idolize Paris Hilton because of 
her money. 
Just like anything else, you’re go-
ing to have your jackasses and your 
persons who are worthy of praise. 
Baseball is working to correct its mistakes but it is still as pure as any 
other professional sport. 
If Allie Conti questions if you can 
love a team, I think she doesn’t un-derstand what baseball still means 
to some of us. 
When Yankee Stadium closed, 
I was on the verge of tears watch-
ing all the greats announced on the 
field, including my favorite Yankee, Bernie Williams, who got a standing 
ovation his first time back in Yankee 
Stadium since his retirement. 
Watching players like Derek 
Jeter makes you feel proud, and you think of them as family, much 
the way Gators fans feel about Tim 
Tebow. And when Derek Jeter even-
tually retires… well, it’s an emotion-
al thought I don’t think any Yankee 
fan wants to think just yet. 
If that doesn’t demonstrate love 
for a team and its players, maybe I should send them all a Valentine’s Day card and some chocolates.

If Hallmark has left your bank account looking a little heartbroken, 
you can still have your Valentine’s Day dream date for under the price 
of a dozen red roses. Besides, expensive dinners are so overrated.
1)Take a tour of Gainesville—by foot. Since you don’t exactly have the 
option of a long walk on the beach, a long walk on the swamp is the 
next best thing.  
2)Skip the movies and head over to Blockbuster. You get variety and 
privacy, so it’s a win-win situation.  
3)Just south of Gainesville, Paynes Prairie will make all of your chick-
flick fantasies come true. If light pollution allows, tell your date their 
eyes remind you of the stars. If this doesn’t win them over, proceed to 
serenade him or her with your best rendition of Coldplay’s “Yellow.”
4)Channel your inner Rachael Ray and create your own candlelit din -
ner. Even if your meal resembles something straight out of the dining 
hall, you’ll look thoughtful and savvy at the same time. 
5)Turn your apartment into a makeshift spa, and take the stress out 
of Valentine’s Day.

After a cold winter spent touring 
Europe, Gainesville’s Less Than Jake is 
home.  
“I now feel warm and rested,” said 
drummer Vinnie Fiorello.  
Less Than Jake, who play a mix of 
ska, metal and punk, will perform at The Venue Friday. Doors open at 8 p.m. and tickets are $18. 
“I can say that we are stoked to 
be home, and we are excited to play Gainesville,” Fiorello said. “By the way we are playing Friday the 13th, which is an added hilarity.” 
LTJ will be playing with Coffee Proj-
ect, Springfield Cubs and Chupaskabra. Buddy Schaub, LTJ’s trombone player, is part of the duo Coffee Project, which will be the show’s opening act.  
“I am really excited to see Buddy 
play,” Fiorello said. “It is one of those things where everyone in the bands is interrelated through some shape or form through friendship. That’s kind of sort of a cool family tree aspect.”
Being home brings out a lot of differ-
ent emotions and memories for the band. 
And loyal fans will have plenty to look 
forward to because the band plans on tak-ing a walk down musical memory lane. 
“I think we are going to dive deep 
into our catalog and do some songs we haven’t done in a while or at all live,” Fiorello said.  
On top of their old tunes, LTJ will per-
form songs off of its new album, “GNV 
FLA,” released last summer. 
 The Gainesville show will kick off a 
new tour. After Friday’s show, the band 
will go to Australia and then back to the states for another tour. Then they are off to Japan, South America and back to the U.S. for the Vans Warped Tour ’09.  
“GNV FLA” is a titled tribute to the 
band’s roots in Gainesville. On the album, the band touches some serious social is-sues lyrically. Fiorello said there are sev-eral metaphors within the lyrics. 
“The underlying message is commu-
nication, that you have to sort of under-stand someone or understand where they are coming from,” he said. “Little bits and pieces of social politics.”
Along with the release of the new al-
bum, the band also recently broke away from the world of big record companies, starting its own label, Sleep It Off Re-
cords. 
Aside from focusing on LTJ, the band 
is excited to branch out and work on 
smaller projects. 
“We have been a band for so long 
that we can sort of allow ourselves to do other projects outside and inside of LTJ,” Fiorello said. “I think you can expect that we will do more different and collectible 
things on the label.”
Despite all the places success has taken 
the band over the past decade and half, 
they have a rooted themselves loyally to Gainesville.Less than

sex on the avenueFor singles on V-Day, don’t fear your fingers, bubble baths
Let’s just put aside the flowers and 
chocolate for a moment of honesty. I’m 
not going to lie or pretend for one sec -
ond that being single on Valentine’s Day 
is fun. It’s like this sick, twisted holiday 
created to constantly remind you that 
you’re alone and unattached, leaving 
you stranded while the rest of the world 
is bursting with pink hearts and teddy 
bears. 
While there is no quick fix to the single 
part, there are a few things you can do to 
escape wallowing in self-pity this Satur -
day. And as much as I hate to use a cli -
ché, looking on the bright side of things 
can actually make life, well, brighter.
Valentine’s Day is supposed to be 
about love, but it ends up being about 
money, money, money. Cards, flowers, 
expensive dinners, fancy jewelry (and 
new shoes to wear out to expensive din -
ners) tend to add up to more than our 
student budgets can handle. You’re bet -ter off not buying extravagant gifts for 
your loved one because chances are, the 
relationship might not last that long any -
way. 
It’s time to bask in the magnificence 
of your singleness. Valentine’s Day is 
all about love, so forget about loving 
anyone else and love the 
most important person in 
your life: you. Buy your -
self flowers, the kind you 
want. That way you don’t 
have to worry about your 
honey getting you cheap 
carnations.
And make yourself 
feel as sexy as possible. 
I know you’ve been working on getting 
your hot body ready for spring break, 
so treat yourself to some sexy lingerie. 
Whoever said you had to wear lingerie 
for someone else anyway? This V-Day is 
all about you. 
Dip your sexy body into a steaming hot 
bubble bath with scented candles nearby to keep the mood as sensual as possible. 
Guys, I know bubble baths aren’t really 
on the top of your to-do list, but I prom -
ise they’ll make you feel sexier than you 
would after a quick shower. Just because 
you don’t have a naked lady in the tub 
with you doesn’t mean you won’t enjoy 
it, and I promise, we won’t 
even judge you when you 
do. 
But this V-Day might not 
only be about emotional 
loneliness. Physical loneli -
ness can almost be worse, 
especially on a day when 
you know everybody else 
is receiving overwhelming 
amounts of sexual pleasure. And some -
times it’s just too hard to curb the urge 
to want some too. So, without a buddy 
to keep you satisfied, perhaps it’s time to 
step outside your comfort zone and plea -
sure yourself. 
There’s no reason to be afraid of it. 
Masturbate. There, I said it. And while your face is probably showing embar -
rassment right now, your mind is most 
likely thinking that it might just be a 
good idea. There’s no reason to feel like 
you shouldn’t please yourself, especially 
on Valentine’s Day. Dare to go down 
there yourself and I promise you’ll feel 
gratified, maybe even more so than you 
would if you had a loved one. 
Vibrators aren’t that expensive any -
more and come in all different colors and 
varieties, so you can find exactly what 
will make you happy.  Even the iPhone 
has a vibrating massager application. See, 
everyone’s mind is in the gutter. Don’t be 
afraid to let a little sex toy into your life. 
Whether you treat yourself with can -
dles and cookies, or personal passion, re -
member that Valentine’s Day is supposed 
to be about love. And love isn’t just for 
couples. It’s for everyone. 
So crack open a box of conversation 
hearts and seize the single life because 
after Saturday, you won’t have to worry 
about Cupid for another year.

How could you do anything with that scum-bag?  You knew you shouldn’t have a beer, but you did. You told me what happens. And what would Bernie think? When I think of his lips on yours it makes me want to puke. And touching your hair, huh? How did your clothes need straightening if he only ran his fingers through your hair? You don’t know what I’ve seen him do with those fingers, where he puts them and then smells them! Ok, I got that out of my system… I don’t know if I can forget what happened, but I think we should get together and talk at my place. Trig won’t be here, he’s looking for a new apart-ment.

ON TELEVISION TODAY IN UF SPORTS HISTORY POLL QUESTION SCOREBOARDI’ve been a sports nut since I was 
little, and while I have always had favorite players, I never turned them 
into more than that.
I wanted to hit like Chipper Jones, so 
I patterned my batting stance after him.
When it didn’t work out for me, the 
message was loud and clear: You can’t become your favorite athlete, so don’t aspire to be your favorite athlete.
So I’ve never understood the phe-
nomenon of using athletes as role mod-els. Sure, I always wanted to be No. 10 in honor of Jones, but that was where it 
stopped. I wanted to be a good baseball 
player like him, not tie my happiness to his off-the-field actions.
In the past few weeks, we’ve seen 
three “role models” come crashing down to earth. Swimmer Michael Phelps had angry fans outside his apartment and lost an endorsement after a picture ran in a Brit-ish tabloid that showed him us-ing a bong. 
Miami Heat 
guard Dwyane Wade — who won a “Father of the Year” award in 2007, an honor shared by Hulk Hogan and John Ed-
wards — is in the middle of a nasty di-
vorce, and allegations abound that he’s 
an absent father and sexaholic. 
And this week, word broke that New 
York Yankee Alex Rodriguez tested positive for steroids in 2003.
Now, it’s depressing enough that 
almost all the sports news right now is Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
UF guard Nick Calathes shoots a free throw during the first half of the Gators’ 97-93 win against South Carolina in the 
O’Connell Center on Feb. 3.
UF MEN’S BASKETBALL
By MIKE DiFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer

It’s like a horrible nightmare the Gators just can’t wake up 
from.
Nick Calathes stood at the foul line in Rupp Arena on 
Tuesday night with the ball in his hands and a chance to force 
overtime.
He missed all three shots — the last was an intentional 
miss — and UF fell to Kentucky 68-65.
But after Calathes scored a career-high 33 points and prac-
tically played as a one-man team the entire night, UF coach Billy Donovan believes Calathes hardly deserves the blame for this one.
“I feel bad for Nick,” Donovan said. “If it hadn’t have been 
for Nick, we wouldn’t have even been in that situation.”
Just moments before Jodie Meeks let go of the game-win-
ning 3-pointer, Calathes found a wide-open Dan Werner for three in the corner.
But with the Gators up 64-63, Werner, who was 1 for 6 
on the night, missed and fouled Meeks while trying to chase 
down the ball in transition.
The Kentucky sharpshooter made both shots, giving the 
Wildcats a 1-point lead with less than a minute to play, and 
set the stage for his own late-game heroics.
“I had confidence in Dan,” Calathes said. “He’s one of the 
best shooters on our team. I thought he was going to make it, but he missed.”
Chandler Parsons (0 for 4 from the field) had his chance at 
the line to give the Gators some much-needed breathing room with 2:40 left and sent both shots off the back of the iron.
Senior Walter Hodge went 1 for 5 and was ejected from 
the game after being given a flagrant technical foul for step-ping on Kentucky’s Perry Stevenson.Donovan not blaming Calathes for loss to Kentucky

UF beat Tennessee for the third time ever, 
entertained the second-largest crowd in school 
history and showed a national television audi-
ence why it deserves to be mentioned with the 
best teams in the country.
The Gators’ reward for doing all that? A 
trip to preseason Southeastern Conference fa-vorite and current No. 24 Vanderbilt.
The No. 9 Gators (22-2, 8-1 SEC) will try to 
get an important road win tonight at 8 at Me-
morial Gymnasium against the Commodores 
(18-6, 7-2 SEC) to keep pace with Auburn at 
the top of the conference standings.
“It’s a shortened celebration, that’s for 
sure,” UF coach Amanda Butler said. “We knew that. We wanted the team to enjoy — as we always do on our Sunday wins — enjoy 
this tonight. You got a day off. Rest your bod-
ies. Reflect back on the things that were good, 
and then on Tuesday get ready to refocus.”
Butler said it’s hard to let off the gas after 
beating the Volunteers because playing the Commodores will be just as much a challenge 
in a hostile environment.
Before and after UF’s win against Tennes-
see, Butler told her team it doesn’t get a bonus point for beating the Volunteers.
It was just one more SEC game, and so is 
the game against Vanderbilt.
“Our team is mature enough to handle 
that,” Butler said. “We can talk about that and make it a pos-sibility, but I don’t know why they would treat this Sunday 
to Thursday any different than 
we have the other ones.”
The Gators have an oppor-
tunity to do something they haven’t done yet in conference play: beat a high-quality oppo-nent on the road.
Their three SEC road wins came against 
the bottom three teams in the conference 
standings.
What better place to start than trying to 
tackle the SEC’s preseason No. 1 team on its 
home floor?

Today’s question: Which professional athlete’s

Tennessee 79� 2006: UF outfielder Lindsey Cameron

slam. She still holds the record (36).� NBa: San antonio vs. Detroit
TNT, 8 p.m.� NBa: Boston vs. Utah
TNT, 10:30 p.m.negative, but the thing that bothers me the most 
is hearing how these guys have let down all the people who look up to them.
Why do people build athletes up into role 
models, hold them to a moral standard that is 
probably out of reach and then act shocked when 
they fail to meet expectations?
Phelps is a 23-year-old with millions in the 
bank and a DUI arrest from when he was 19. But because he swims fast and has a goofy smile, peo-ple look up to him.
Same with A-Rod. He hits a baseball well, but 
why do people put a stake in his morality? He was caught running around on his wife, and now 
we hear that he cheated in sports, too.
And I don’t buy his apology, either. He went 
into a choreographed interview with ESPN’s Pe-
ter Gammons, who he knew wouldn’t bury him with tough questions, and then he lied.
Rodriguez said he was under pressure and he 
experimented with some supplements, and he implied that he got them at GNC. 
Only problem: The things he reportedly tested 
positive for, testosterone and Primobolan, can’t be bought at GNC. Those come from people who specialize in dealing steroids.
So A-Rod is a cheater and a liar, and Phelps is 
prone to lapses in judgment. Honestly, who hasn’t fit into those categories from time to time? 
It’s only a big deal because, for some reason, 
we expect more from them. 
This is the worst time to be a role model. There 
are entire Web sites set up for the sole purpose of showing famous athletes and celebrities getting in trouble. There are eyes everywhere.
Athletes in the past didn’t have to deal with 
this level of scrutiny, but that will never be the case again, meaning we should be far more hesi-
tant before we name a fast, strong or big dude an 
exemplary human being for all to emulate.
Luckily, there’s an easy way for us to stop this 
trend. When you have children, be a role model for them. Don’t let them use athletes.
Except for Tim Tebow, of course.THURSDAY, FEBRUARY  12, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 19

UF second baseman Aja Paculba runs to home plate as she watches Francesca Enea’s 
home-run ball fly out of the park during the Gators’ 8-0 win against Baylor on Saturday.
UF SOFTBALL
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator.org
After falling 1-0 to Baylor on Sun-
day, UF coach Tim Walton placed all the 
blame for the loss on his hitters. Wednes-
day, the Gators showed their true poten-
tial at the plate. 
The No. 2 UF softball team (3-1) held 
just a 1-run lead entering the top of the 
fifth inning of its game at Jacksonville (1-
5), the team’s first road game of the sea-son. The Gators then blew the game wide open with 10 runs in two innings, includ-ing 8 in the sixth on five hits.
“We kind of started off slow, but we 
finally made adjustments and got every-thing together and really started produc-ing runs,” second baseman Aja Paculba 
said.
Almost everyone was effective at the 
plate for UF on Wednesday, as seven dif-
ferent Gators finished the game with at least one RBI, and Paculba led UF by go-
ing a perfect 3 for 3 at the plate, driving 
in 3 runs and scoring twice.
“She’s got so many different dimen-
sions to her game,” Walton said.
Left fielder Francesca Enea was the 
only other player to turn in more than one RBI, and she did so on just one hit — a 2-run double with one out during the Gators’ explosive sixth inning.
UF started off slow on offense, and 
Jacksonville maintained a scoreless tie entering the third inning. But when the Gators were backed into a corner, the top of the order came through. 
UF had two outs and nobody on base, 
but Kim Waleszonia dropped a bunt to keep the inning alive. 
Paculba followed up with a single up 
the middle, and, after fouling two balls to the same spot in left field, Ali Gardiner knocked a single into the outfield that 
brought in Waleszonia for the Gators’ 
first run of the game.
The Gators continued their scoring 
in the top of the fifth — once again with two outs against them. After pinch-run-
ner Danyell Hines moved ahead to third 
base on back-to-back sacrifices, Paculba knocked the ball deep out of left field for a 2-run home run, her second of the 
year. 
Pitcher Stephanie Brombacher (2-0) 
shut out the Dolphins, throwing six in-
nings, giving up only two hits, striking out eight batters and walking none. 
“It makes pitching a lot easier when I 
know they’re going to put 11 runs on the board,” the sophomore said. “I think any pitcher can pitch with that kind of run 
support.”
Redshirt freshman Shaunice Harris, 
who sat out all but three games last year 
and the preseason with a torn ACL, saw some time on the field in the sixth in-
ning. 
Harris grounded out in her first at-bat 
back with the Gators but ended the game 
by throwing out Jacksonville’s Amanda 
Schmidt at first.
A radio broadcast contributed to this 
report.Gators rebound from loss
“Obviously, Walter, Dan, Chandler shoot-
ing the ball — we didn’t get a lot out of them,” 
Donovan said.
Werner, Parsons and Hodge were a com-
bined 2 for 15 from the field.
“It was really Nick pretty much carrying 
us,” Donovan said. “He was the total, main reason why we were even in that position.”
The Gators once again had a chance to win 
a game with free throws down the stretch, and once again they failed to do so.
UF missed its last four foul shots of the 
game while Kentucky converted its final four.
That marked the second time this season 
the Gators have failed to make free throws at the end of a big road game.
But Calathes said he doesn’t believe the missed shots are a trend.
“Not at all,” he said. “I’m 
going to be in that situation again, and I’m going to be ready.”
HODGE WILL PLAY AT GEORGIA:  The Southeast-
ern Conference office has 
confirmed that the senior’s ejection Tuesday night was for a flagrant technical foul and not for fighting.
Hodge will be available to play in UF’s 
game at Georgia on Saturday.
“I didn’t see it,” Donovan said. “The of-
ficials were judging whether he had intent of 
stepping on the guy. At the time, Walter was 
baffled and confused. I don’t know if that was 
Walter’s intent, but, you know, it was a veteran crew out there, and I trusted their judgment.”Hodge to be available at Georgia despite Tuesday’s flagrant technical foul
because it’s a road game,” senior for-
ward Marshae Dotson said.
UF has won a school-record 
seven straight SEC games and is off to the program’s best start after 24 
games.
The Gators are in the heart of 
their toughest stretch of the season, with a trip to LSU, a team that has 
been to five straight Final Fours, looming Sunday.
But Vanderbilt is not just a sand-
wich game. 
The Commodores have the 
Gators’ full attention.
“Coach Butler ain’t going to let us 
lose focus,” guard Sha Brooks said 
Tuesday. “I’m pretty sure today’s 
going to be even 10 times more in-tense (in practice) just to show us 
that we can’t get relaxed and we 
can’t get comfortable with being ranked No. 9. We still want to strive and hopefully be up there at No. 1 and No. 2.”
If practice was anything near as 
intense as Butler’s pre-practice inter-views, then Brooks was right about 
her team’s focus.
Butler sat and rode her workout 
bike Tuesday while at the same time 
watching film of Vanderbilt, remote in her left hand and giving out-of-
breath answers to reporters’ long-
winded questions.
It appears the Gators’ intense 
coach has herself and her team as focused as ever.UF enters year’s toughest stretch

UF WOMEN’S GOLF
 By ANTHONY CHIANG 
 Alligator Writer 
  
 After a long trip to Califor-
nia, the UF women’s golf team 
will have a long trip back to 
Gainesville.
The Gators just could not 
escape the middle of the lead-erboard in the Northrop Grum-
man Regional Challenge in Pa-
los Verdes, Calif.
The team ﬁ  nished the tour-
nament tied for eighth place out of 16 teams with a score of 
96 over par. In Wednesday’s 
third round, the team shot 30 
over par.
Freshman Evan Jensen’s 
third-round score was the low-est single-round score of the tournament for the Gators. She 
shot 3 over par and knocked in 
three birdies on the day. Jensen 
got off to a good start with a 
score of 1 under par in her ﬁ  rst nine holes.
“I just stayed really patient and tried to go through my routine every time,” she said.
Her third-round score was a 
big improvement from her ﬁ  rst 
two rounds, which totaled 17 
over par.
“I just hit the ball overall 
better today,” Jensen said. “I 
think every 
day you play 
this course 
you get a lit-tle bit better,” 
Jensen said.
The usu-
ally depend-
able Jessica Y a d l o c z k y 
could not ﬁ  nd a rhythm in the ﬁ  nal round and shot 11 over par, the worst score of the day for the Gators. 
She struggled with nine bo-
geys and one double bogey. Her tournament score of 19 over par, however, was the best 
on the team.
Andrea Watts and Lauren Uzelatz both shot mediocre 
rounds. Watts ﬁ  nished the day with a score of 7 over par, while Uzelatz shot 9 over par.
If the team learned anything 
in this tournament, it was the importance of being patient, Jensen said.
“I think we have all learned 
patience and that you can’t force it,” she said. “You have to be patient and let it come to you.”
Arizona State won the tour-
nament with a score of 46 over par.
The Gators hope the experi-
ence they gained this week will 
help them in the long run.
“We are deﬁ  nitely young 
and still learning,” Jensen said. 
“So any kind of experience we can get will help us for the next 
tournament.”
The Gators will be back in 
action on Feb. 22 at the Kiawah 
Island Intercollegiate in South Carolina. Gators ﬁ  nish in middle of pack

 THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
  
 JACKSONVILLE — The Jack-
sonville Jaguars essentially ac-
knowledged two failed free-agent acquisitions Wednesday by releas-
ing receiver Jerry Porter and cor-
nerback Drayton Florence.
The Jaguars paid more than $23 
million for Porter and Florence to step into starting roles last year, but both failed to make an impact on the ﬁ  eld and may have been even less impressive in the locker room.
Teammates privately blamed 
them for the chemistry issues that plagued Jacksonville (5-11) all sea-son.
“In going through our person-
nel evaluations and roster analysis we are making decisions that we believe will help improve our team for the 2009 season and beyond,” 
Jaguars general manager Gene 
Smith said.
Porter signed a six-year, $30-mil-
lion contract that included $10 mil-lion guaranteed. He also earned $1 million in salary last season, but caught just 11 passes for 181 yards and a touchdown.
He started the season on the 
physically unable to perform list following hamstring surgery and ended the year on injured reserve (groin). Teammates singled him out as a main culprit for the chem-istry problems — a label Porter ﬁ  rst earned in Oakland. Jaguars release WR
