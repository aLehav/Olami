University Police is investigating a series of burglaries this week at 
the Keys Residential Complex.
Police have not arrested anyone in connection to the incidents, and 
an investigation is ongoing, said UPD spokesman Maj. Brad Barber.
The ﬁ  rst incident happened between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m. Sunday , 
Barber said.
Jen Gresley, residence life coordinator for the Tolbert and Keys ar-
eas, sent an email to residents later that afternoon telling them about the incident.
“It seems that someone might be catching on that apartment doors 
are not always locked,” she wrote.
In the email, Gresley encouraged students to remind each other to 
keep their front doors locked.
Unlike other residence halls on campus, Keys doesn’t use elec-
tronic cards for the 419 residents to get into the buildings.
“Your doors open right out to the general public like many apart-
ments’ complexes do,” Gresley wrote. “It is a responsibility that 
comes with living in these apartment-style locations.”Keys burglaries, holiday safety tips
�MORE THAN 20,000 UF STUDENTS 
DEPEND OF FEDERAL AID.

Eric Brown is worried.The UF political science sophomore is 
one of more than 20,000 UF students who depend on certain types of federal ﬁ  nan-cial aid — some of which they could lose in 2013 if the U.S. Congress fails to act on the looming “ﬁ  scal cliff.”
“I think it’s insane that people are be-
ing held hostage like this,” Brown, 19, said. “Everyone’s suffering.”
The ﬁ  scal cliff refers to a set of auto-
matic federal spending cuts and tax hikes engineered by Congress in an effort to force themselves to compromise on lowering the country’s debt.
Since all attempts at working together 
have failed so far, Congress now has 26 days to reach a deal before the nation faces Fiscal cliff could impact student aid, researchSEE SAFETY, PAGE 8

UF athletes will give Gainesville more 
than wins this holiday season.
The University Athletic Association 
is collecting shoes and monetary dona-
tions from Gators sports teams to give to Alachua County elementary school students.
The drive, called Gator Tracks, is in its 
12th year, said Levi Leigh, UAA student athlete development coordinator.
The UAA partnered with the Alachua 
County School Board to determine the schools most in-need and get the sizes of students, he said.
Athletes donate, wrap and deliver 
the gifts to the children, he said. They wrapped the presents Monday and will deliver them to schools Thursday , Friday and next week.
“We really enjoy doing the drive, and 
our student athletes really walk away with something too,” Leigh said.
The kids get excited, said Kelley Ko-
stamo, Alachua County Public Schools partnership specialist.
“It crosses something off their list 
of things that they might be worried about,” she said, adding that eliminating that source of stress may translate to bet-ter performance in the classroom.
Kostamo once measured the shoe size 
of a student who was wearing house slippers as shoes. Not every student is like that, she said, but the schools try to choose students who are especially in need.
Summer Stephens, a 19-year-old bi-
ology sophomore and member of the women’s swim team, witnessed the im-pact of Gator Tracks when she delivered shoes last year. A few boys who received Nike Jordan basketball shoes were espe-cially enthusiastic.
“It was something that really touched 
me,” she said.

If you like it, put a ring on 
it.
Many college students plan 
to do just that and get hitched 
by their mid-twenties.
A recent national study pub-
lished in The Journal of Social and Personal Relationships dis-covered that many college stu-dents intend to take the plunge into marriage by the time they are 25 years old. However, the study also found that a majority of parents think 25 is too young to get married.
According to the study , the 
main reason parents hesitate to send their children down the aisle is the idea that they should get an education first.
Peter Sherrard, an associate 
professor in the Counselor Ed-ucation Department, said there is no “right age.”
“I think it has more to do 
with why you’re getting mar -
ried,” he said.
Sherrard said it is better if 
young people become stabi-lized in their careers and life choices before they settle down and have a good grounding about who they are as individu-als.
“Marriage often stabilizes 
the people who are involved in marriage,” he said. “Some people are seeking that stability , and they want to gain that sta-bility sooner rather than later.”
However, Sherrard said, the 
divorce rate is higher when you marry earlier in life. The aver -
age national divorce rate is a little more or less than 50 per -
cent, he said.
Sherrard said one’s family 
background also has an effect on young marriages.
“Each heritage is a little bit 
different in shaping how a mar -
riage is both chosen and un-folds,” he said.
Brittany Seamon, a 22-year-
old family, youth and commu-nity sciences senior, said her parents wanted her to earn a college degree before she got married. Technically, she will.
In August, Seamon became 
engaged to her now fiance, David Kline. She will graduate in May and in June will marry Kline, whom she dated for al-most five years.
Seamon said her fiance is in 
the U.S. Coast Guard in Con-necticut, which partially in-fluenced their decision to get married. “We’re kind of under a time crunch,” she said.Study shows more

� RUNNERS WILL GET 
GLOW STICKS. CARINA SEAGRAVE
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF will host its first Light Up 
the Night 5K at 7 p.m. Friday at 
Pony Field, on the corner of Gale Lemerand Drive and Mowry Road. Participants wearing bright clothing and glow sticks will run/walk to benefit of A Walk in My Shoes Inc., which collects shoes to send to people in need in Haiti, said CEO Caryn Barry.Registered runners and walkers 
will receive a glow party kit with glow sticks, glasses, bracelets and necklaces so they glow as they run through the blacklight-lit route.
Race director and event coordi-
nator Dan Phillips said more than 130 people have registered, but he expects between 400 and 500 to sign up. The race costs $20 for students and $25 for nonstudents who register early. All registra-tion will be $30 the day of race, he said.
The route will end with a party 
in a 20- by 30-foot tent on Pony Field, he said.“I’ll be wearing neon for vis-
ibility and will be sporting my glow gear,” Phillips said.
  The Florida Running Club will 
provide water bottles and the reg-
istration table staff for the race, said the organization’s president, 24-year-old food science and hu-man nutrition senior Mark Benja-min.
The event is modeled after the 
Midnight Fun Run in April, put on by Healthy Gators and RecSports. 
 “In Florida,” he said, “it’s the 
only place you can have a night 
run in December and not have ev-
eryone be freezing.”
Runners light up the night for charity“I think it has more to 
do with why you’re get-
ting married.”

Gainesville Open MRI wants you to 
raid your pantry for a bag of rice, can of 
tuna or box of macaroni and cheese to feed a hungry belly.
The medical group will give back 
to the Bread of the Mighty Food Bank by kicking off its first food drive from noon to 4 p.m. Saturday.
There will be a car show, bounce 
house and pictures with Santa Claus. The event is free, but donations are welcome. 
“It’s Gainesville’s largest and best 
food bank,” said Joe Colorio, manager of Gainesville Open MRI. “We want to collect as much perishable food as pos-sible.”
The staff of the medical facility wants 
to do something special with the pub-lic, Colorio said. The group will spon-sor a family event while giving food to the less fortunate. Because Thanksgiv-ing takes a toll on the food bank, Open MRI will help it prepare for the holiday season.
The Gainesville Open MRI has been 
in business for more than 15 years.“You see hunger for hope in people 
with need. Those who used to be do-nating to us are now the ones standing in our lines,” said Marcia Conwell, ex-ecutive director of the food bank. “And our lines are not getting any smaller be-cause the need isn’t being filled.”
Conwell said she has worked with 
the food bank since 2004 and has fed people across North Florida in Alach-ua, Dixie, Gilchrist, Lafayette and Levy counties.
The food bank has helped North 
Central Florida since 1987, she said. This year, the food bank distributed more than 35,000 pounds of food, she said. In addition, from 2011 to 2012, it distributed about 4.8 million pounds.
“If we collected 8 million pounds of 
food, I would be able to send everyone away happy — and full,” she said.
Within the five counties, one out of 
four children is food-deprived, and one out of five senior citizens don’t know if they will eat tonight, Conwell said.
Shands at UF, North Florida Region-
al Medical Center, Publix, Walmart and other companies often host food drives for the bank throughout the year, and the food bank is happy to have the sup-port of Gainesville Open MRI.
“People have hope when you hand 
them food and they are hungry,” she said. Gainesville medical group

The Alligator is the largest student-run newspaper 
in the United States, and we won’t stop anytime soon.
We do our best to fully represent the university and the City 
of Gainesville by covering news that is most important to the 
area. We were your source of information throughout the search for Christian Aguilar, and we will follow the subsequent trial of Pedro Bravo as closely as we can.
Our paper is the place for journalism students to submit their 
stories and hope that the extra credit is enough to soften the blow of ﬁ  nal grades.
We provide crossword and Sudoku puzzles for you to ﬁ  nish 
between, or during, your classes each day . We don’t want to say “You’re welcome.” Instead, we’d like to say “Thank you.”
Thank you to everyone who voted to save our racks, an ini-
tiative that meant very little to some in the Student Government world but meant very much to us.
Thank you to everyone who submitted a guest column or a 
letter to the editor this semester, because it shows our readers just how diverse and unique our community is.
Thank you to everyone who picked up our paper because 
of a cool photo featured on our front page, as our photography team works as diligently as our staff writers to inform and en-tertain you.
Thank you to everyone in the UF and Gainesville commu-
nity for continuing to be a vibrant culture that we are honored to cover every day.
Thank you to everyone who, with a regained fervor, pored 
over the Sports section as the Florida Gators football team ﬁ  nally shook off that nasty breakup from years ago.
We’re here to serve you. Without your help or input, this 
paper would not succeed. If there’s something we can improve upon, please tell us. If there’s something we do that you like or appreciate, let us know that, too.
Everyone does better with a little feedback every now and 
then. Our goal is to represent our city and university to the best of our abilities, but we can’t do it without your help.
Continue to submit your stories and work with our editors. 
Don’t stop commenting on our articles, whether on our website or on our section Facebook pages.
Write a column or a letter if you have something to get off 
your chest; it’s how we found out about the feral cat problem on campus.
You are the bumpers on the bowling lane of newspaper pro-
duction. You correct us when we do something wrong, but you also help us nail our targets.
This is our last newspaper of the semester, and we couldn’t 
have done it without you.
In the meantime, study hard and ﬁ  nish this semester on a 
high note. And remember, Trader Joe’s is going to open in just a couple of weeks, which is the best holiday treat of them all.

On ﬁ  nding a passion and a purpose
College is difﬁ  cult.
It wasn’t the classes that got me. Academics 
have always been my strong suit, and for the most 
part, I ﬁ  nd there’s nothing that a pot of coffee can’t get me 
through.
I came to UF alone, which was ﬁ  ne. I made friends easily  
with a couple of the girls on my ﬂ  oor in Reid Hall and tagged along with them everywhere.
By the end of my ﬁ  rst semester, I knew UF wasn’t for me. 
I’ve never been into football. I felt under-challenged in my classes. I couldn’t get my new friends to come with me to punk rock shows, downtown art exhibits or most of the other things I liked to do.
I started looking into transfer programs. My parents told 
me college would get better. So, I stuck it out.
I chatted at frat parties with many friendly frat boys who 
didn’t seem to care that I was a member of Gamma Delta Iota sorority.
(In retrospect, a lot of them were probably too drunk to 
get the joke. But most of them were nice to me.)
I went to tailgates, adorned myself with Gator gear and 
sang “We Are the Boys from Old Florida” with strangers at the end of the third quarter. I still love singing the song.
I joined a couple of student organizations: Pride Student 
Union and Volaticus, the aerial dance club.
I did all of these things with people I met on campus, my 
freshman ﬂ  oormates and their friends they’d been going to school with for a decade already . They were kind people with good hearts, and I keep in touch with a few of them.
But I still felt deeply unsatisﬁ  ed with life.When I started working at the Alligator, my world opened 
up quite a bit.
Two full years into my undergraduate career, I met peo-
ple who were like me, both in personality and preferences.
I’m fond of saying that working here is one part summer 
camp, one part “All the President’s Men” and one part Jame-son Irish Whiskey.But more than allowing me to 
make friends with people who want to do the same things I want to do, the Alligator gave me a sense of purpose.
Part of it is putting into practice 
what I learn in classes every day . You’re not always sure what to do with those lessons in, say, eth-
ics, until you have to make an ethical decision that could af-fect the lives of the people you write about in the paper. (I’m looking at you, Dr. Lewis. Thanks.)
But the best thing about working for the Alligator, for me, 
is being part of something bigger than myself.
For the past 16 weeks, I was at the helm of the largest stu-
dent-run newspaper in the country. We print 30,000 copies of the Alligator every day , but publishing online has expanded our reach to readers around the world. Really. I’ve received hate mail, love mail and threats of lawsuits from readers in Berkeley, Calif., London and Puerto Rico, respectively.
It puts things in perspective for me. I went through a fairly traumatic breakup earlier this se-
mester.
Luckily , working upward of 40 hours a week running 
a newspaper didn’t leave me a lot of extra time to wallow. Nothing takes your mind off your own suffering more than a missing UF student and a presidential election, especially when you know that literally tens of thousands of people ex-pect you to follow through so they can read about it.
I come to work every day loving what I do. Find some-
thing in college that makes you feel the same way , regardless if it’s related to your major or what anyone else thinks you should do.
Working at this newspaper has made my college experi-
ence worthwhile. I hope you make what’s left of your four years here worthwhile for you.

Let’s look back on the events of this 
nearly completed semester in a somewhat atypical manner.
We begin in August, when the dread-
ful heat that dominated The Swamp had an impact so large that it still seems like people come up to me asking the seem-ingly most important question in the his-tory of the world: “Are you registered to vote in Alachua County?” It seemed we couldn’t go more than 10 minutes across campus without being bombarded with information from various political groups.  That’s just one of the joys of the election season.
It appears that actor Clint Eastwood 
suffered from the heat as well. At the Republican National Convention, he lectured to an invisible President Barack Obama in a chair. Fortunately for the es-teemed actor, the president’s health care plan should assist him just ﬁ  ne.
In September, ﬁ  rst lady Michelle 
Obama visited campus. Ticket lines prac-tically extended from the gates of the Ste-phen C. O’Connell Center to Jacksonville and back. Remarkably, this led to many of us thinking “Wait, don’t all of these peo-ple have jobs?”
When October came, the Gators fought 
for Southeastern Conference domination. Sadly, the Louisiana State University Ti-gers claimed they lost to the Gators Oct. 6 because of the heat. Ap-parently , we didn’t get the memo that the bayou of Baton Rouge was perma-nently trans-ported to the 
Arctic tundra. 
The same week was the ﬁ  rst presi-
dential debate. Now, Obama is waking up from his slumber while, in the mean-time, many still insist that not all votes are counted. Where else would this occur but Florida?
According to some interpretations of 
the Mayan calendar, the end of the world might soon approach. Scholars dispute this claim, but it’s possible, considering President Obama recently hosted former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney at the White House for lunch. If a good faith bipartisan gesture doesn’t convince the apocalypse is near, what will?
As the semester comes to a close, I wish 
everyone good luck on ﬁ  nals and happy holidays. Don’t be scared of weather get-ting in the way . After all, it’s not as if the fate of theworld depends on it.

opinions@alligator.orgI refuse to be a “Christian.”
I know how odd that may seem, espe-
cially coming from the guy who’s been 
ranting about Jesus for a semester, but I’m 
serious.  
It’s bizarre, but I’m comfortable leveling 
with you all. Somewhere between the Face-book ads that entice me to hook up with “hot Christian singles” and the least God-honoring celebrities in our culture boldly proclaiming to be Christians, I decided that it wasn’t for me.  The Christian majority doesn’t resemble its spiritual namesake, and that’s more than a mi-nor problem for me. It’s a deal breaker. I love Jesus, but I refuse to be a Christian, and I hope you’ll understand why .   
As an African American, I’ve learned im-
portant lessons about labels. Growing up as an “oreo,” mostly because of the way I speak, I found that my label let others know who I was and how I’d act way before they met me.  
As someone who follows Jesus, I’m sure 
you can imagine the difﬁ  culty I’ve had with simply being labeled a Christian. For starters, I don’t hate gay people, and I enjoy the relation-ships I’ve cultivated with those who identify themselves as gay as much as I enjoy my inter-actions with Christians who have no problem sleeping around. The Bible says that both are in sin, and if you knew half of my story, you’d understand why I’m in no position to judge.
How Christians became known solely 
for the sins that the Bible preaches against is beyond me, though. That’s certainly part of the equation, but Jesus’ early followers were known for far more than that. Jesus didn’t just spout abstract facts about God — he brought God’s Kingdom directly to the peo-ple. He preached against sin but then went and ate with sinners. His super-natural love trans-formed the entire space around him, inciting the reli-
gious elite to vigorous hatred and everyone else to utter astonishment.  
When Jesus told people to follow him, 
they did more than add him on Twitter.  They gave up everything to pursue him. Somehow, Christians prioritized weekly meetings in a building instead of meeting daily with their Creator through prayer and scripture.  
Sure this is all semantics, but I’m tired of 
special interest groups trying to hijack mo-mentum from the Kingdom of God. I want my word back.  I’m tired of people liking Jesus Christ’s page on Facebook and then living bla-tantly hypocritical lifestyles, as if the God who sees our hearts will accidentally press “like” on their eternity .  
The world has seen enough of the lame 
substitute with the Biblical misnomer.
Hey, America, give me my word back!  
Hey , prideful-religious-group,  give me my word back! Hey, people-without-any-inten-tion-of-actually-following-Jesus, GIVE ME MY WORD BACK.  
Until then, I refuse to be another “Chris-
tian”.

opinions@alligator.orgOn Monday , police received 
another report from the com-
plex that a burglary happened between 2:30 a.m. and 5:30 a.m.
Although the burglaries 
happened a day apart, Barber didn’t say if the cases are direct-ly connected, but he noted how similar they were.
“Both cases … occurred dur-
ing early morning hours and similar items were reported as being stolen,” he said.
The stolen items were smart 
phones, video game consoles and games, Barber said. Cloth-ing was reported stolen both days.
Detectives from UPD’s 
Criminal Investigation’s Divi-sion are looking for evidence as well as suspects involved in the burglaries, Barber said.
An email sent to students 
Tuesday afternoon hints at a third burglary unreported to police, but Barber said he couldn’t conﬁ  rm any details.
With the semester coming to 
a close, more students are leav-ing campus for the holidays.
Meanwhile, UPD receives 
more reports about burglary thefts across campus, said UPD Capt. Jeff Holcomb.
“It’s really that time where 
we’ll see an uptick in property thefts,” he said.In December 2011, police re-
ported ﬁ  ve burglaries on cam-pus: one in a residence hall and four in businesses, Barber said.
In a campus-wide campaign 
to lower property thefts this holiday season, UPD will hand out ﬂ  yers that encourage stu-dents and faculty to be vigilant, Holcomb said.
Other agencies also remind 
students to be safe this holiday season.
“I think we become com-
placent in our everyday lives,” said Art Forgey , Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce spokes-man. “It’s a series of reminders that the holiday season invites crime.”
Forgey said the most helpful 
tip to stay safe during the holi-days is to always be aware of your surroundings.
He said people should have 
packages sent where someone will accept them. And after pur-chasing items, people should cut up the boxes before throw-ing them away .  
“Don’t advertise what’s un-
der your tree,” he said.
Forgey said the public 
shouldn’t feel paranoid about crime, but it’s better to be cau-tious.

about your safety are long and gone,” he said. “We are trying to remind people to have safe and happy holidays.”Smart phones and video

UF stands to lose funding for research
harsh penalties.
While this would affect students 
who, like Brown, depend on feder-
al ﬁ  nancial aid programs, the ﬁ  scal cliff could also impact students in-volved with research.
This means UF could face an-
other budget cut.
UF gets about two-thirds of its 
funding from federal agencies. Vir-tually all of the federal agencies that fund UF would experience 7 to 8 percent budget cuts if Congress doesn’t reach a deal on the ﬁ  scal cliff, according to a report released in September by the White House’s Ofﬁ  ce of Management and Budget.
Although it is unclear how these 
ofﬁ  ces would absorb the lost reve-nue, UF could lose a portion of its federal funding.
This lost revenue would be cou-
pled with deep cuts already levied by Florida’s Legislature.
“We don’t know a whole lot 
about what’s going to happen,” UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said. “It’s unclear how the federal agen-cies would make their cuts.”
UF and other universities also 
stand to lose funding for research. Federal programs that write grants for university research — like the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health and the National Endowment for the Humanities — would see cuts be-tween 7.6 and 8.2 percent in their budgets, according to the White House report. This could mean less money available to award for research.
Awards could also be limited for 
students, like Brown, who depend on federal ﬁ  nancial aid programs.
While the Federal Pell Grant 
will remain unscathed during 2013, virtually all other federally funded ﬁ  nancial aid programs could see budget cuts of more than 8 per-cent.
This would include federal work-study and the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant, according to Inside Higher Edu-cation, which are two of the most common aid programs.
Brown relies on the Federal Pell 
Grant and the Supplemental Edu-cational Opportunity Grant to help pay his tuition. But with the cuts to the Supplemental Educational Op-portunity Grant, Brown fears that he may not have enough money to get his degree.
“Basically, either I’ll have to 
drop out or get a couple of jobs to make up for the difference in what I’ll get for my tuition,” Brown said. “I could take out private loans, but then I’d be racked with debt.”
Taking out private loans could 
prove more expensive, too, as stu-dent loan origination fees would also increase if the U.S. reaches the ﬁ  scal cliff, according to Inside Higher Education.
Richard Wilder, the director 
of UF Ofﬁ  ce for Student Financial Affairs, said students shouldn’t worry about evaporating federal assistance this academic year.
“I don’t believe this will affect 
students for the spring semester,” Wilder said. “But next year, who knows?”
Despite the possible conse-
quences that await universities and students across the country, Con-gress has made little headway in negotiations.
President Barack Obama said 
he would require a deal to include increased taxes on the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans, according to The New York Times.
However, some Republican leaders in Congress said they would refuse to raise the tax rate. Some refuse to raise the rate unless Congress alters so-called entitle-ment programs like Medicaid and welfare, according to The New York Times.
Leading Democrats say they 
are unwilling to adjust these pro-grams.
Cliff Stearns, a Republican who 
represents Gainesville and Ocala in the U.S. House of Representatives, said he would like to see Congress decrease spending.
However, he said he hopes the 
House of Representatives will set priorities on what programs to fund, like higher education.
“By relying on automatic cuts, 
Congress is abandoning its respon-sibility,” Stearns said in a state-ment. “The cuts, set to take place at the start of 2013, would directly impact higher education and the University of Florida.”
But almost 900 miles from 
Washington, D.C., some people at UF said they ﬁ  nd it hard to under-stand why the Legislature would use universities’ funding and fed-eral ﬁ  nancial aid as pawns in a game of political chess.
Brown said he’s not the only 
person worried about the future of his education.
Brown’s mother raised Brown 
and his three brothers by herself while working full-time as a regis-tered nurse. Brown said his mother tried to instill the importance of education in each of her sons, but now, she’s worried that her young-est son may face ﬁ  nancial obstacles while trying to ﬁ  nish his education. She’s worried it’s one check she won’t be able to write.
“She wants me to focus on my 
education, so now she’s going to stress out about it,” he said. “She’s already overworked.”

� FOOTBALL ATTENDANCE DROPPED 
BY 1.6 PERCENT FROM LAST YEAR.
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Contributing Writer
Despite the success of Gators athletics on 
the field and hardwood this year, UF has 
seen less attendance at its Fall sports.
Compared to last year, the average turn-
out at home football, basketball, volleyball and soccer games dipped, according to the University Athletic Association’s attendance figures.  
Gators football attendance dropped by 1.6 
percent from 2011 to 2012. At the seven home games this year, the average attendance at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium was 87,597, the low-est number since the Gators switched from six to seven home games in 2005.
“Those [numbers] are probably gener -
ous,” said industrial and systems engineer -
ing freshman Ben Rosenthal, 19. “You’d look up, and there would be whole sections with no one sitting there.”
Ben Hill Griffin Stadium has 88,548 seats. 
During the 2009 season with quarterback Tim Tebow, The Swamp averaged 90,635 at-tendees a game.
The Gators are ranked No. 3 in the Bowl 
Championship Series standings, and will play in a BCS bowl for the first time since Tebow’s senior season.
Attendance for the No. 7 Gators men’s 
basketball team’s home contests started low. Through the squad’s first five regular-season games, Stephen C. O’Connell Center atten-dance dropped by 6.7 percent, compared to last season’s 9,732 average after five con-tests.  
Gators soccer took the most drastic atten-
dance hit in 2012. The team reached the low-est average in its 18-year history with 1,051 fans a game. In 2011, UF soccer saw an aver -
age of 1,999 attendees a game.
The 15th-ranked Gators volleyball team 
also saw decreased attendance, but not as severely as other UF sports. This season, the team averaged 2,468 fans a game — 224 few-er than last year.
Ted Spiker, a UF associate journalism pro-
fessor who teaches Sports Media and Society, believes television and social media changed the entire fan experience.
“People like sitting at home with their 
laptop on their lap, looking at Twitter feeds, watching the game, doing a million things at once,” Spiker said.
Spiker also thinks not having a clear su-
perstar like Tebow hurt the football team’s attendance numbers this year.
“We’re in the superstar era,” Spiker said. 
“Obviously , people love team success, but I think you totally see a different mentality in the fans when you have a central figure that kind of transcends the team.”
Lucas Dolengowski, the research and de-
velopment committee chairman for the Men’s Basketball Rowdies, believes attendance will get better as the season progresses.
“When football season ends in January, 
less people will be latched onto that,” the 20-year-old telecommunication sophomore said. “We’re spoiled here at UF. When we don’t have the big matchup, people don’t go.”Gators sports attendance down� SHE ATTENDED FILM

Leonor Antoni ﬂ  oats across 
her kitchen as Latin music blares 
through speakers. Customers come and go, always making sure to give her a hug and a kiss. In this kitchen, she’s everyone’s mom.
Antoni, 47, is the owner and 
chef of Corner, 1220 W. University Ave., a Latin fusion restaurant.
Antoni, born in Caracas, Ven-
ezuela, said corn is a staple in Latin American food, especially Venezu-elan meals. The taste of home pops up often on Antoni’s menu.
Antoni’s speciality is an arepa, 
which is a cornmeal cake served sandwich-style.
To her, it’s just lunch that she 
learned from her mom to make.
Antoni said when she was 
thinking of names for her restau-rant, she loved Corner because it had the word “corn” in it.
She looked up the deﬁ  nition of 
corner, and it was “a place where borders meet.”
She said she cried with joy. She 
had the name for her restaurant.
“Food is one of the few things 
where you can get through to peo-ple in such a deep place,” she said.
A mother of two, Antoni wor-
ries about Corner often.
“I feel like I have a third child 
now,” she said.She said she loves to watch peo-
ple eat their ﬁ  rst arepa. 
Antoni remembers when her 
stodgy father-in-law ate his ﬁ  rst arepa and cracked a smile.
She said she has always been 
crafty, including in high school. Antoni said she used to get in trou-ble because of the radical stories she wrote for the school’s newspa-per.
In the kitchen, she cooked with 
the women in her family. She said cooking is a way of life in Venezu-ela.
“No one teaches,” she said. 
“You just do.”
Besides food, Antoni is a pho-
tographer and published a book of poetry, “Entre Entes.”
After jumping between Cara-
cas, Venezuela, and San Francisco, where she attended ﬁ  lm school, she rekindled a friendship with her ﬁ  rst boyfriend 30 years later. He was a horseman moving to Ocala, and she came along. They’re now married.
Once word got out that Antoni 
could cook, she started teaching cooking classes for seven of her husband’s co-workers.
She taught them how to make 
risotto on Italian night and paella on Spanish night, and she set the mood with music and pictures from the parts of the world show-cased in the food.
She got a lot of hugs from the 
ranchers’ wives.
“I’ve always been happy to feed 
people,” she said, “and making people happy.”
But if she wanted to teach, she 
said, she needed to get formal training.
Antoni enrolled in the Johnson 
& Wales University’s culinary arts program on the North Miami Cam-pus. At 45 years old, Antoni was older than some of her instructors.
That wasn’t the only problem. 
She found that professors kept “feeding students lies” and mak-ing them think they were all going to work as celebrity chefs.
She said there were no classes 
that taught how to run a restaurant or manage catering ﬁ  nances.
“It was a horrible experience,” 
she said.
She said she felt insulted that the 
students thought they could come into the world of food and just in-stantly succeed, as if her lifelong passion was a fad. But through the adversity, she ﬂ  ourished.
She graduated in the top 1 
percent after two years with a 3.9 
GPA.
After graduation, she taught a 
summer camp for children ages 7 
to 15 years old at the Biltmore Ho-tel in Miami.
She loved to see students come 
out of their shells and connect with food. Crying mothers thanked her.
“These kids are going to be 
changed for life,” Antoni said.
She stills gets calls from the chil-
dren and the men she taught in Oc-ala with questions about recipes or just to chat. It’s her policy to give every class she teaches her phone number and the chance to call her whenever they need help cooking.
Even with a degree in culinary 
arts from a program that gradu-ated celebrity chefs like Tyler Flor-ence and Chris Santos, Antoni stills takes calls from ranchers. Occa-sionally, when she’s having a panic attack about Corner, she eats her favorite snack, Jalapeno Cheetos.
“People think because I’m a chef, I don’t like Cheetos,” she said.

ASIAN AMERICAN STUDIES.
SAMANTHA SHAVELL
Alligator Staff Writer
Student Senators unanimously 
passed a bill urging UF to establish an 
Asian American studies minor at their last meeting of the semester Tuesday.
Faculty members teaching Asian 
American studies courses submitted a proposed minor to the curriculum com-mittee Nov. 9, according to the bill.
The minor would require courses 
that are already being taught and serve as classes for majors in English, religion, political science and women’s studies.
After the meeting, a former sena-
tor who helped with the bill, Nhi Tran, said the Asian American Student Union and the Asian Paciﬁ  c Islander Ameri-can Affairs started mobilizing in 2004 to get faculty support for Asian American Studies.
That year, UF created a 12-credit certiﬁ  cate in Asian American Studies. Three additional credits, for a total of 15 credits, would be needed to change the certiﬁ  cate to a minor, according to UF standards.
Tran, a 21-year-old biochemistry ju-
nior and the campus affairs chairwoman for AASU, said the minor would be under the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. She also said the classes that would be required for the minor continue to have high enrollment.
According to the bill, UF already has 
an African-American studies minor, a Latin American Studies minor and a Na-tive American Indian and indigenous studies minor.
The push for the minor was sparked 
by the blackface incident in October when two Beta Theta Pi brothers painted their bodies black at an off-campus so-cial, Tran said after the meeting.
“Our community is looking forward 
to educating other students as well as our own,” she said.

Despite his clipped wings, Pep-
per the parrot is now mobile and a 
little quieter thanks to robotics.
Pepper now cruises around in 
the Bird Buggy, a robot created by Andrew Gray, a 29-year-old elec-trical and computer engineering graduate student, for the intelligent machines design laboratory course.
The Bird Buggy, and 12 other 
robots created by students in the course, will be on display today at this semester’s Robot Media/Guest Demo Day. 
The free event is put on by the 
class’s professors, A. Antonio Ar-royo and Eric M. Schwartz, and will be from 1 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. at the New Engineering Building in the Harris Corporation Rotunda.
Students worked all semester 
on autonomous robots that do not require continuous human guid-ance or remote controls to perform tasks.
Students had to develop their 
own ideas and ﬁ  nd the appropri-ate parts. While some robots cost between $200 and $300, others are made from $1,000 worth of metal and circuitry.
Schwartz said he enjoys seeing 
the joy on his students’ faces when they show off their hard work. Many have gone on to get jobs after their participation in the course.
“You’re kind of the grandpar-ent,” Schwartz said. “You’re the parent of the student, and the stu-dent is the parent of the robot.”
Students faced several chal-
lenges in the development of the robots, but none like John Phillips, who took his robot a level deeper: underground.
The 22-year-old mechanical en-
gineering senior built an 8-by-4 foot wooden box in which his robot, Holey Moley, can navigate hills of dirt. Using two sensors, Holey Moley 
can tunnel through mounds of dirt, positioning itself without the need for remote controls.
The name, he said, sprang from 
a conversation with his father.
“I sent him a picture of it, and he 
said ‘Holey moley!’ and I said, ‘Man, that’s a great name,’” he said.
While Holey Moley digs through 
dirt, the Bird Buggy will make its debut sans Pepper, whose screams were not only the inspiration for the project but also the reason Pepper won’t  make an appearance.
For Gray, it began with trying to 
suppress Pepper’s shrieks. He ﬁ  rst tried a robotic squirt gun that would squirt the African grey parrot every time he screamed. But when Pepper started using it as a birdbath, Gray decided to try a rattling device. Pep-per eventually ignored the rattle.
The Bird Buggy is the latest in Gray’s attempts to silence the screeches. Pepper is more calm when around Gray, so he wanted to enable the bird to follow him around the house.
The buggy is a square-shaped, 
four-wheeled metal vehicle lined with newspapers for Pepper’s oc-casional droppings. In the front stands the joystick, which Pepper can control with his beak, and be-hind it is the bird’s perch. Sensors in the front prevent the robot from bumping into anything, such as the occasional wall or chair leg.
When not navigated by the par-
rot, the Bird Buggy will go into au-tonomous mode and dock itself, a feature Pepper particularly dislikes.
“If you leave him on, he gets re-
ally angry because he tries to move the buggy, and it doesn’t respond to him,” Gray said, “so we just take him off. Otherwise, he has a ﬁ  t.”

The event is free and begins at 1 p.m.

student, and the student is

The flu season may have had its earliest start 
in nearly a decade this year, but UF has yet to 
see anything out of the ordinary.
According to the Associated Press, the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention re-ported Monday that higher-than-normal influ-enza reports occurred in five Southern states — Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. Parts of Georgia also saw an increase.
Although this jump in cases has led to the earliest start to the flu season since the winter of 2003-2004, many UF students say they don’t think flu season at the university has been worse than normal this year.
“This semester, I haven’t run into any sick 
people in comparison to last semester,” said 22-year-old history senior Ilya Kovic. “I actually feel less people are sick this semester.”
Nineteen-year-old public relations sopho-
more Tyler Lares said that although he has no-ticed more sick students this year, he wouldn’t claim there’s an increase.
“I think you just get kind of paranoid,” he said. “You see one sick person, and in an hour, you see like 20 [sick] people and think, ‘Oh God, I’m gonna die.’”
Neither student received a flu shot or plans 
to get one this season. 
“I’ve never had a flu shot in my life,” Lares 
said, “and knock on wood, I’ve never needed it.”
Catherine Seemann, marketing coordinator 
for UF’s Student Health Care Center, said the amount of flu-like cases at the university is con-sistent with previous years.
She said the Student Health Care Center saw 37 cases with flu-like symptoms this semester. However, the amount of flu cases at the univer -
sity generally doesn’t peak until February.
Seemann said students who haven’t gotten a 
flu shot yet should get one.
So far, the Student Health Care Center has 
given 5,000 flu shots. It usually takes two weeks for antibodies to build up in a person’s system.
“It’s not only important to get the shot to 
protect yourself,” Seemann said. “When you get the shot, you’re also protecting your com-munity.”
Flu shots at the center are free for UF stu-
dents and don’t require an appointment. Nasal mist and intradermal flu vaccinations are avail-able for $15.

Gators have a chance to help the 
Orlando community.
The UF Research and Academic 
Center at Lake Nona, which aims to 
increase research opportunities while enhancing medical care in the Orlan-do area, opened Friday.
The roughly 106,000 square-foot 
facility is at 6550 Sanger Road in Lake Nona.
Academically, it is a collabora-
tion of UF’s College of Pharmacy and UF’s College of Medicine, said Melanie Ross, director of news and communications for the UF Health Science Center.
“It is an opportunity for research-
ers and educators to work together and for the needs of Floridians in the Orlando community,” Ross said.
Regarding research, the facility 
provides space for UF’s Institute for Therapeutic Innovation, the Center for Pharmacometrics and Systems Pharmacology, the Institute on Ag-ing and the Clinical and Translational Science Institute.The center provides a location for 
the research institutes to better inter -
act with patients, said David Nelson, director of clinical and translational science at the Clinical and Transla-tional Science Institutes and associate dean of clinical research.
“The building really represents a 
chance for the best and the brightest of UF’s researchers to improve peo-ple’s lives,” he said.
Although UF has research insti-
tutes in Gainesville and Miami, the Lake Nona center is the largest edu-cational research institute in the Or -
lando area, he said.
UF offered long-distance educa-
tion in pharmacy in the Orlando area for about 10 years, but students be-gan taking courses in the Lake Nona center in August.
About 200 students are pursu-
ing doctorates in pharmacy or post-doctoral fellowships at the center, but it plans to increase its incoming classes from 50 to about 72, said Erin St. Onge, assistant dean and campus director for the center.
The center will allow students to 
work directly with well-known re-searchers, St. Onge said.
The center also hopes to provide 
educational opportunities to stu-dents who can’t move or commute to Gainesville.

horses since she was a fifth-grad-er living on a New York farm about 30 miles away from the Big Apple. She paid $1,200 for her first horse at age 15 in monthly $100 payments.
“I ran home from school every 
day to ride the horses,” she said.
When she told her high school guidance counselors she wanted to go to horsemanship school after graduation, she said they looked at her like she was crazy.
But they found a yearlong 
school for her in New Canaan, Conn.
Her experience with the gentle 
giants hasn’t always been an easy one.
On May 20, 1980, a horse 
kicked her toddler daughter, Kathy, in the head.
The left side of the 3-year-old’s 
body was paralyzed. She was in a coma for about 35 days.
When she awoke, Kathy had 
to re-learn how to walk, talk and — eventually — ride.
“She was a newborn baby at 
3,” Gray said.
Gray kept telling people she 
would walk for the first time since the accident by Christmas.
She was sure of it.On Christmas Day, Kathy 
walked. Her first word since the accident: “Hi.”
By 4 years old, Kathy was back 
on a horse.
Now, Kathy is a three-time 
horseback riding national cham-pion. Kathy earned her titles at the United Professional Horse-men’s Association’s Exceptional Challenge Cup Championship in Kansas City.
“She’s my miracle,” Gray 
said.
Gray helped hundreds of oth-
er children, too, like Sheryl Cyr’s daughter.
Cyr, 41, helped her daughter, 
Megan, learn to ride horses when she was 8 years old. Megan, 19, is autistic and has cerebral palsy.
When she was younger, doc-
tors said she would never walk or interact with people.
But Megan was always able to 
connect with animals.
“Autism has its advantages 
and disadvantages,” Cyr said.
Megan, with long brown hair, 
glasses and what seems a con-stant smile, is training seven dogs and 10 rescue cats. Many of the animals show up in her yard; other people leave animals at her doorstep.
So when Cyr was at a Christ-
mas parade with her daughter and saw a sign hanging off a horse for therapeutic horseback riding, she ran after the horse to write down the phone number written on the sign.
Once Megan began riding 
horses, her self-esteem grew, and she started to open up to more than just her family and animals.
The first thing Megan said to 
someone who wasn’t a family member was to Betty Gray: “Are all of these horses yours?”
After two weeks of riding, Me-
gan competed. In her first compe-tition, Megan placed third, “out of three.”
“This is the happiest day of 
my life,” her mom remembered she said.
Now, Megan has won the na-
tional champion title in Kansas City twice.
Before she started to ride, Me-
gan wouldn’t talk and had trou-ble relating to people.“You can’t shut her up now,” 
she said. “This is her thing. This is her out.”
Cyr said she saw her daughter 
not only develop mentally, but physically.
Cyr, a nurse at Pediatric Health 
Choice in Gainesville, said when you ride a horse, your body mim-ics the motion of the horse, which strengthens muscles.
She said children with physi-
cal disabilities especially benefit from horses because, many times, their muscles are either too tight or too weak to use properly.
People who are disabled im-
prove their postures and, in some cases, gain the ability to walk, she said.
“It’s a full-body workout in an 
hour,” Cyr said. “The kids don’t know they’re working out.”
Not only is it good for her, but 
Megan loves it.
“It makes me feel like a super -
hero, being higher than every-one,” Megan said. “It feels like you’re on another planet.”

Ashley Williams is an outsider, even in her 
own family.
She grew up in a Christian home. Her uncle 
is a pastor. She sat in church, bored.
“When I was young, my mom took my 
brothers and I to church, but I’ve never been 
super religious,” said Williams, a 22-year-old UF public relations alumna. “I would consider myself an atheist.”
She isn’t alone.More Millennials, the generation that grew 
up near the year 2000, are switching from the Protestant denomination to being religiously unaffiliated, according to a study published Oct. 9 by The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life.
The study states that one in three American 
adults ages 18 to 22 are now unaffiliated with religion.As recently as the 1960s, two in three Amer -
icans called themselves Protestants, according to the study.
The study states that in the last five years, 
the amount of unaffiliated U.S. adults in-creased from more than 15 percent to about 20 percent.
The Millennial generation is the first of its 
kind to come of age in a more secular society , and the effects are easily seen in such a diverse, college-aged population as Gainesville.
The Baptist Collegiate Ministry Student 
Center, 1604 W. University Ave., felt the im-pact firsthand.
“There are definitely less students involved 
than in years past,” said David Wood, associ-ate director of the student center. “In the four and a half years that I have been here, I have seen a steady decline.”
Wood said the center is combating the 
change by advertising in the Gator Green-backs coupon books and handing out fliers on campus. 
The staff is brainstorming other ways to 
reach out to students, but so far, its techniques aren’t showing any difference in student at-tendance.
“We’re a student organization, and we 
work heavily with UF,” he said. “Our doors are open to all students. I wish I could wave a wand and let everyone on campus know what we have to offer, but it’s not that simple.”
The Rev. Dan Wunderlich, associate pastor 
of the Gator Wesley Foundation, a Methodist student center, 1380 W. University Ave., said that although national student membership is low for Protestant churches, the Gator Wesley Foundation slowly gained membership in the past few years.Since Wunderlich became a pastor six years 
ago, the number of active students steadily rose to about 200 active student members.
Amanda Long, a 21-year-old biology ju-
nior, is involved in Theta Alpha, one of two Christian-based sororities on campus.
“I think as young adults we see this trend 
on a very normal basis,” she said. “My best friend can be placed in this category , and while I wish it weren’t the case, she is still the friend I know and love.”
Wunderlich said he hopes students find 
something to believe in, regardless of their be-lief systems. 
“If students maybe had a negative experi-
ence in church growing up or have had a neg-ative experience with churches since coming to college, there are spiritual centers, whatever your faith or background, that are interested in meeting you where you’re at, rather than expecting you to be something when you walk in the door,” he said.

dents involved than in years past.”

Dave Balogh’s coaching career 
is defined by loyalty to a team 
and loyalty to a friend.
Balogh has spent 13 seasons as 
an assistant coach for the Florida women’s tennis team. 
During his tenure, he has 
helped the Gators win three na-tional championships. He has also earned two ITA National As-sistant Coach of the Year awards, becoming the first Gators coach to do so. 
Balogh’s resume as an assis-
tant coach in Gainesville begs the question: Why not build his own program as a head coach?
Chalk it up to his loyalty.Balogh said he has fielded 
head coaching offers from Ar -
kansas and Wake Forest, but he never showed interest. 
“For me, it’s not the title that’s 
in front of my name,” Balogh said. 
“It’s about the titles we can 
hopefully win behind the name ‘The University of Florida.’”
  
Balogh is committed to UF. Coaching anywhere for 13 
years creates an attachment to the program. But for Balogh, that’s not where it started. 
Playing at Florida could have 
spurred his faithfulness, but that’s not the beginning, either.
The Gator gene was imbed-
ded in Balogh the moment he was born.
He lived minutes away from 
the campus as a child and was raised a Gators fan. 
Balogh attended home foot-
ball games and always dreamed of going to UF. 
Once he realized he might 
have the opportunity to play for the program, there was no doubt in his mind.“If I’m good enough, and they 
need me, I’d like nothing better than to play for Florida,” 16-year-old Balogh told the Gainesville Sun.
Balogh’s dream became a re-
ality when he signed his letter of intent to Florida in November 1992.
“That was one of the greatest 
days of my life,” Balogh said. “To have the opportunity to play for the University of Florida was a dream come true.”
UF ranked in the NCAA’s top 
15 during each of Balogh’s four seasons as an athlete. 
Balogh received the 1996 Pres-
idential Recognition Award from then-president John Lombardi in honor of his achievement and contributions to Florida.
During Balogh’s freshman 
season in 1993, he stepped onto the green stage against a familiar foe: Georgia freshman Albert Po-lani, a top-ranked recruit in that year’s high school class.
Two years earlier, when both 
were high school juniors, Polani handily defeated Balogh in a tournament match. 
This day was different, 
though.  
For three sets and three-and-
a-half hours, the two battled.  After a 75-minute third set, Ba-logh held his hands in the air in triumph.
 “Georgia was a powerhouse 
at that point and to be the last match on there and to get a win against a guy that was much bet-ter than me was just one of the best moments,” Balogh said.

Between 1996 and 1998, Ba-
logh worked as the assistant head professional at DB Raquet-ball Club in Gainesville before an opportunity to coach collegiate tennis fell into his lap.Balogh’s former coach at UF, 
Ian Duvenhage, heard that an as-sistant coaching position opened at Vanderbilt. He recommended Balogh call Vanderbilt to look into the job.
Balogh did, and he coached 
there for a year. 
He then served as an assis-
tant coach at Florida State for a semester before receiving an un-expected phone call from former Gator Andy Brandi.
Brandi, Florida’s women’s 
coach at the time, said he wanted to bring Balogh back home to Gainesville. 
Balogh called it his second-
greatest Gators moment, behind signing his letter of intent. 
He had a simple response for 
Brandi: “You don’t have to say anything else. I’ll just pack up my stuff right now.”

After growing up a Gator, Ba-
logh is raising his two sons, Cade and Colby, in the same environ-ment. 
But that’s not the reason he 
has remained an assistant coach.
Balogh’s biggest reason for 
staying is his best friend — head coach Roland Thornqvist.
“This guy is the reason I’m 
still here,” Balogh said. “What Roland has provided me and my two boys is priceless. For me, loyalty is No. 1.”
For seven straight years, 
Thornqvist and Balogh have traveled to Daytona in July. The trip has become a tradition.
They do not take the trip to 
coach or recruit. 
Instead, the tandem travels to 
the Daytona International Speed-way to watch the Pepsi 400. They also visit the pits and garage be-fore the race and drive the wreck-ers during the parade lap. 
“He has not only been a great 
colleague, but a great friend over these 12 years,” Thornqvist said. “He’s been instrumental, clearly, to our success here the last few years.” 
In the past 12 years, Thorn-
qvist and Balogh have won three national championships and tal-lied nine SEC titles. 
Head coaches typically re-ceive the bulk of the credit, but senior Lauren Embree said Ba-logh should get just as much rec-ognition as Thornqvist.
“Dave doesn’t like talking and 
doing the interviews and liking all the spotlight, but he deserves just as much credit as Roland,” Embree said.
Thornqvist said he believes 
Balogh likes being in the back-ground. 
While Balogh doesn’t like the 
attention, Thornqvist said he and Balogh run the team as a unit.
“Dave knows that he is my co-
captain, and our players know that Dave is the co-captain,” Thornqvist said. “Dave and I share 50 percent equity in what we are doing.”

Balogh acknowledges that 
many others would have moved on to a head coaching job, but that’s not him.
“When things get a little 
bumpy, more people tend to bail out and think the grass is greener on the other side,” Balogh said.  “I’m not like that. I’m about sticking through it.”
During the 2004 season, top-
seeded Florida lost to 23rd-seed-ed Miami in the second round of the NCAA Championships.  The Gators had their undefeated season and 40-match win streak snapped at home.
In 2005, No. 2 Florida lost 4-3 to No. 5 Vanderbilt and 5-2 to No. 6 Kentucky in a span of 48 hours.
The struggles kept Balogh 
awake for three straight nights. 
He wondered what he could have 
done to prevent the losses. 
Still, Balogh remained at UF. “Roland, we’re best friends,” 
Balogh said. “We have had a lot of great moments, but we have had some downs, and we have stuck together.”
Thornqvist would love to 
work with Balogh for another 13 years, but vows to stand behind his loyal assistant.
“If he ever decides to leave, 
I’m going to support that decision because he surely has poured his heart and soul into [Florida],” Thornqvist said. “We’re going to do what’s best for Dave. If that’s staying here, great. If it’s getting a head job somewhere else, we are going to be there right behind him.”
Don’t expect Balogh to switch 
schools any time soon. His roots are planted firmly at UF. 
“Dave Balogh is a Gator in 
every sense of the meaning,” Jer -
emy Foley, the athletics director at UF, said via email. “He has a passion for coaching and a pas-sion for the Gators.”
Thornqvist added: “He’s the 
most loyal human being that I ever met, so I cannot say enough about Dave. He’s a quality man. Not just a great coach, but a great man.”
Beyond his upbringing and 
his relationship with Thornqvist, Balogh points to one trait that ex-plains why he is still an assistant coach at UF and not running a program of his own. 
“Loyalty,” Balogh said. “How 
good people treat you, having a great head coach, great team, great group of girls and having fun at what you do. When you have those qualities, it’s hard to leave a place.”

� FLORIDA FACES FLORIDA STATE 
TONIGHT AT 7 IN TALLAHASSEE.

  Through six games this season, the 
Gators are doing more than just winning. 
Not only does Florida boast a 6-0 record, but it has won each game by an average mar-gin of 25.3 points — more than double last year’s 10.9.
  UF’s 33-point win on Thursday against 
Marquette — last year’s Sweet 16 opponent — highlighted the team’s early success. Still, coach Billy Donovan wants the Gators to avoid complacency and focus on the game at hand. 
  “The biggest thing I’ve tried to do since 
the Marquette game is to get them to under-stand that every day you have an opportu-nity to move forward and get better,” Dono-van said. “In life, the hardest thing to be able to handle is success. When success comes, being able to handle that is important.”
  After the 82-49 win against Marquette, 
Florida moved up one spot to No. 6 in the AP poll. The Gators are one of 20 undefeat-ed teams. Despite the success, Donovan said UF has room for improvement after strug-gling with transition defense and allowing too many open looks against Marquette. 
  “You win a game by [a large] margin, 
you come back to practice the next day and it ends up being a mindset of, ‘We’ve got this all ﬁ  gured out, we know what we’re do-ing,’” Donovan said. “That’s where I really think slippage starts to occur.” 
  Florida (6-0) will face its ﬁ  rst true road 
test when it takes on Florida State (4-3) to-night at 7 in the Donald L. Tucker Center in Tallahassee. 
Although the Seminoles have a tough 
defense, they are coming off back-to-back losses to No.14 Minnesota and unranked Mercer.
  Senior guard Mike Rosario remains con-
ﬁ  dent.
  “It is an important game for us as it is 
important to those guys, too,” Rosario said. “Right now we are focusing on the things we can control.”
  Said forward Will Yeguete: “It’s a rivalry 
game. They’re going be ready to play no matter what, no matter how many games they lost before. I think they’ll be ready to play and will play harder than any game be-fore. We just got to make sure we’re ready to face them.”

JURNY DUTY
  We’ve all received the 
emails.   The ones that 
were unfathomable a 
little more than three years ago.
  If UF students and other 
Gators football fans get these emails again in the next month, a fan base that considers itself one of the best in the nation will de-serve to be lampooned.
  The emails come from the 
Gator Ticket Ofﬁ  ce saying that tickets are still available for the upcoming Florida football game.  These emails became common 
after Florida’s 137-game sellout streak ended on Sept. 3, 2011, in a season-opening win against Florida Atlantic. 
The emails also ﬂ  owed in 
at the end of the 2009 season, when the program failed to sell its 17,500 allotted tickets for the Sugar Bowl.A
According to the Gainesville 
Sun, 4,500 of those tickets were unsold three days before the game. Student ticket prices were re-
duced from $125 to $65. 
And this wasn’t just any bowl 
game. The New Year’s Day con-test against Cincinnati was Tim Tebow’s ﬁ  nal game as a Gator. In a 51-24 win, Tebow completed 31 of 35 passes for 482 yards and three touchdowns while running for 51 yards and another score.
  If UF fails to sell their allot-
ted tickets for this season’s Sugar Bowl, the fan base will look even worse.   T h e 
G a t o r s were ex-pected to win it all in 2009. 
Florida 
controlled its title 
hopes until falling to Alabama in the Southeastern Conference Championship Game. Fan disap-pointment in that case is under-standable.   This team is about as far from 
a disappointment as one can get. We viewed UF as an eight-win team before the season. 
Following a 17-9 loss to Geor-
gia on Oct. 27, a BCS bowl did not appear to be in Florida’s fu-ture. Nobody thought a title was a possibility before Kansas State and Oregon lost on Nov. 17.
  Some might not make the trip 
for fear of not seeing a competi-
 Florida fans can’t afford bad showing in New Orleans

TUESDAY IN THE O’CONNELL CENTER.

  For freshman Sydney Moss, the past 
week involved grieving and thousands of miles of plane rides. 
  She ﬁ  nally had a reason to smile on 
Tuesday night. 
  After missing Monday’s practice to 
be with family following the death of her 
grandfather, Moss returned to help lead Florida (6-3) past Troy (1-6) 87-62 on Tues-day in the O’Connell Center. 
  “I’m just happy to be back with my team,” Moss said.
  Moss ﬁ  nished 
with 18 points on 8-of-11 shooting. She also pulled 
down four rebounds and notched ﬁ  ve as-sists in a do-it-all effort. 
  “Sydney is just a playmaker,” coach 
Amanda Butler said. “All of us — coaches and teammates included — have come to expect that something good is going to hap-pen when she is on the ﬂ  oor.”
  Following a grind-it-out loss to Michi-
gan on Saturday, Butler knew her team should expect an up-tempo contest against Troy, which averaged 81.3 points per game Freshman returns to team, sparks UF victory with all-around playSEE JOSH, PAGE 22

In Texas, they don’t mess with Tay-
lor Unroe.
The Longhorns bring out the best 
in the Gators’ sophomore libero, and 
Unroe aims to continue the trend in the Sweet 16 on Friday night at 8 in Austin, Texas.
“It’s helpful to see what teams’ ten-
dencies are when they’re under pres-sure … when the match is on the line,” Unroe said of her experience with Texas. 
“It’s kind of nice to see how they 
react to situations like that, what plays they go to when they need a point.”
Unroe recorded 15 digs in a 3-0 (29-
27, 25-22, 26-24)  loss to the Longhorns on Aug. 31 at the Nike Big Four Clas-sic in University Park, Pa. 
She tallied 20 digs in Florida’s 3-2 
(25-22, 20-25, 25-13, 21-25, 15-12) win against Texas at the same tournament in 2011.
Her 4.38 digs per set against the 
Longhorns best her 4.04 career aver -
age. 
She ranks fifth in the Southeastern 
Conference with 4.42 digs per set this season.
Unroe’s defense comes against ar -
guably the best attack in the NCAA the last two seasons. 
Texas leads the nation with a .320 
hitting percentage this year and fin-ished the 2011 campaign ranked fourth with a .286 clip.
Perhaps the most dangerous Long-
horn is outside hitter Haley Eckerman, who was unanimously chosen as the 2012 Big 12 Player of the Year. 
The sophomore leads the league 
with 4.51 kills and 5.16 points per set.
Eckerman anchors the left side of 
Texas’ attack along with All-Big 12 outside hitter Bailey Webster, who ranks second in the league with 3.75 kills per set and is third in hitting per -
centage at .345.
Despite Unroe’s defensive effort, 
the Gators could not stop the Long-horns’ left-side duo during their pre-vious meeting at the Nike Big Four Classic. 
Eckerman and Webster combined 
for 29 kills and a .315 hitting percent-age in the win.
“They’re still one of the most physi-
cal teams we’ve seen this year, espe-cially on the left side,” Wise said. 
“Their left sides are two elite, elite 
players.”

alligator.org.UF libero key against high-powered foe
tive matchup. Many assume Louis-
ville, a 16.5-point underdog, will not keep the game close.
Some fans worry they won’t get 
their money’s worth. 
A Florida-Louisville matchup isn’t 
as exciting as a showdown against Oklahoma. 
But Florida consistently proved it 
can’t blow teams out. 
Even when the Gators win by 
a large margin, they aren’t fun to watch.  
Beating Bowling Green by 13 and 
topping Louisiana on a blocked punt in the final minute are obvious ex-amples.  
Even though UF wore down FSU 
in its regular-season finale, the game was still close for three quarters. The Gators play to the level of their com-petition, and there is no reason to believe they won’t continue to do the same against the Cardinals.
A trip to New Orleans should be 
enough reason to go. 
If Gator Nation wants to keep its 
reputation intact, it needs to pack the house as Florida tries to cap a memo-rable season.
Contact Josh Jurnovoy at jjurnovoy@
alligator.org.JOSH , from page 21 Five Gators scored 10 or more
before Tuesday. 
Florida featured a balanced offensive out-
put. Five Gators scored in double figures.
Moss and redshirt freshman Carlie Nee-
dles each notched 18 points. 
“We’ve got a lot of different people who 
can be threatening,” Butler said. “Offensive-
ly, we did a really good job of playing well together, but everyone individually took their shots at the right time.”
Despite the balanced contributions, Flor -
ida could not pull away prior to halftime, a trend that cost UF in the loss to Michigan. 
Troy’s Aarika Howard connected on a 
jumper with 16:31 remaining in the second half to cut Florida’s lead to 48-41 and put the Trojans back in the game.
Florida responded with a 16-2 run during 
the next six minutes to open a 64-43 lead. 
 “We buckled down and got a couple 
stops and hit some shots along the stretch,” Needles said. “Our defense really ignites our fire.” 
Moss, who admitted the recent travel 
drained her, capped the run with a layup.
Though she was not fully ready to play, 
Butler said the team was glad to have her back.
“It’s a great luxury to have a player like 
Sydney,” Butler said. “If you get the ball in her hands, she is really capable of doing anything on the court.”WOMEN’S HOOPS ,

Arielle Gunderson carries a reminder of 
her sister wherever she goes. 
When she looks at her wrist, she sees a 
green bracelet with pink writing. On the out-
side, it says: “Aubrae, forever in our hearts.”
Inscribed on the inside is: “Enjoy life today; 
yesterday is gone, and tomorrow may never come.”
The Gators freshman knows the motto too 
well.
		  
Arielle and Aubrae grew up in Covington, 
Ga., a suburb about 35 miles outside Atlanta. Both girls played soccer and ran cross country. Both excelled in school.
“She got in trouble every once in a while, 
but honestly my parents had it so easy with her,” Arielle said. “When it came to school, she had a much better work ethic than I do. If she could have a 100 in that class, she was going to have a 100.”
The two behaved like typical siblings: ar -
guing, playing, inventing their own games and getting into just a little bit of trouble.
“We used to pillow-slide down the stairs,” 
Arielle said. “We used to get in a lot of trouble for this, because we wrecked a couple laundry baskets. … We discovered that laundry bas-kets slide really well down the stairs.”
But on Sept. 26, 2005, while Arielle and her 
mother, Eileen, were at a friend’s house, trag-edy struck.
While at a voluntary cross-country prac-
tice, Aubrae tried to cross a stretch of High-way 138 about 200 yards from her school. An SUV stopped to let her pass but blocked her from the view of a car in the next lane.
The car struck Aubrae, killing her instantly. 
She was 15. 
Aubrae’s death had a huge impact on Ari-
elle, who was 11 years old.
“Whenever there’s something traumatic in your life, it’s going to change who you are,” Arielle said.
After Aubrae’s death, Arielle had a difficult 
time adjusting to her new reality. Large crowds made her claustrophobic, and she struggled to get through school days. 
The difficulty of Arielle’s turmoil was evi-
dent in her clothing.
“My sister used to dress me,” Arielle said. 
“I was really a tomboy kind of kid, and she was like, ‘You can’t dress like that anymore.’”
“All of a sudden, I didn’t know what to 
wear anymore. I went through drastic style changes. I was like that punk, probably-shouldn’t-let-your-child-hang-out-with-that-person (style), to country … and finally ended up back at the way she used to dress me.”
She became impatient with things she 
deemed unimportant. But one thing kept her focused.
“I went back to practice two days after,” 
she said. “I literally needed it in my life. I loved soccer beforehand, but it definitely got stron-ger after that. It was kind of like my outlet.”
But Arielle hasn’t seen the soccer field 
much in the past three years.
  
There were 34 seconds left in the first half, 
and Arielle’s Conyers (Ga.) Heritage High Patriots were about to go into halftime with a commanding 7-0 lead. 
Arielle beat one opponent off the dribble 
and attempted to cut inside, putting all her weight on her left foot. An opponent slide tackled her from behind and her left knee buckled. Her junior season was done. 
“I knew, because all my weight’s there … 
of course, that’s your ACL,” she said.
The knee injury put Arielle’s recruitment at 
risk. She was in contact with the Gators coach-ing staff before the injury and attended UF’s soccer camp. She suffered the ACL tear a week and a half after her unofficial visit.
“Arielle has a great combination of aca-
demics and athletics,” Gators coach Becky Burleigh said. “The combination of those two was really attractive to us.”Although Arielle wanted to commit to 
Florida, her recruitment took a back seat to re-hab as she worked to get back to the field for her senior season. 
Once her knee healed, Arielle returned to 
Gainesville for soccer camp in the summer of 2011, and Burleigh told her UF was still inter -
ested in her. Arielle committed that October.
After graduating in the spring of 2012, Ari-
elle played for the Georgia Revolution of the Women’s Premier Soccer League. On June 9, the Revolution faced Mississippi Fuego FC at the Jackson Preparatory School in Flowood, Miss. There, Arielle suffered another setback.
In her second-to-last game in the WPSL 
before traveling to UF for the Summer B se-mester, Gunderson attempted a tackle and suffered another serious injury.
“I knew I had injured my knee and was 
probably going to have to redshirt,” she said. 
An orthopedic surgeon told Arielle she had 
suffered another ACL tear.
“I think ‘not-too-happy’ is an understate-
ment,” she said. “I would probably say anger was the biggest thing. … I was distraught.”
Arielle redshirted her freshman year. Bur -
leigh said she expects her to play a role as part of the Gators’ defense in the future.
“She’s very, very confrontational in her de-
fense,” Burleigh said. “She’s got a really strong mentality, and that’s something we really val-ue on this team.”
Arielle watched her teammates advance to 
the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament while she focused on getting back on the field for spring soccer.
“It kind of gives you an edge that some 
people don’t have,” she said. “If they’ve never had the game taken away from them, some-times you really don’t understand how much you love it.”
  
More than 400 people gathered at the start-
ing line at Heritage High’s track on Nov. 24. Many more watched from the stands. They were there for the Aubrae Gunderson Memo-rial Scholarship 5K Walk/Run. In the months following Aubrae’s death, 
some of her cross-country teammates ap-proached their coaches about creating a schol-arship run in her honor.
“I had some of the coaches come to me, be-
cause people were just donating money; the school was being sent money in her name,” Dan Gunderson, Arielle and Aubrae’s father, said. “It was all kind of a blur. The coaches were real helpful in putting it together.”
The 5K has been held the Saturday after 
Thanksgiving for the past seven years. The $1,250 scholarships are awarded to two Heri-tage student-athletes each year, and an addi-tional scholarship is available to other students in the county . 
“A parent complained to me that the 
scholarship didn’t go to the best athlete; I was like, ‘Yeah, you’re missing the point. It’s for student-athletes,’” Dan said, emphasizing the word “student.”
But the 5K is not all business. One of the 
events is the “High Heel Hustle,” where par -
ticipants don stilettos and, at the shout of “Ready, set, clearance sale!” run a 40-yard dash.
 “It is one of the funniest things you’ll ever 
witness in your life,” Arielle said. “My cousin Kenny has his pair and has since painted them to have blue racing flames.”
The Gunderson family is also involved in 
the Aubrae Gunderson Invitational, a cross-country meet Heritage hosts every Septem-ber.
The race was originally named the Patriot 
Invitational but was renamed in Aubrae’s honor. The race was the last she ever ran.
The Invitational hosts hundreds of runners 
each year. For four years, one of those runners was Arielle Gunderson.
Each year she ran, Arielle set personal re-
cords. 
“I just had so much invested there that it 
was always my best run,” she said. “It’s a cool feeling to know that so many people know her, and remember her, even if they never met her.”

HER HEART
