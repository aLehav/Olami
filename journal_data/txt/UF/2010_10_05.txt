his Harley-Davidson about 300 miles from 
the Mackinac Bridge in Michigan to the Ohio border without using his hands to steer to raise money for Parkinson’s disease research. 
Phil Comar of Adrian told The Daily 
Telegram that the Sunday ride is in memory of his father, Robert, who died in 2008. He wants to raise $3,000 with the ride for the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research.
The 61-year-old has been riding motor 
bikes and motorcycles almost 50 years, and said he’ll steer with his legs and by leaning. An extra gas tank has been added to the back of his motorcycle so he can go nonstop.
Comar plans to ride to the bridge that 
connects Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and Lower Peninsula on Saturday — no-handed at times.

They drain students’ pockets, but 
many students don’t know what they 
are. Activity and service fees fund ser -
vices offered through Student Govern-
ment, the Reitz Union and RecSports, and they generate millions of dollars. The 2010 to 2011 Activity and Service 
Fee Budget for UF is almost $16 million, 
according to Student Government doc-uments obtained by the Alligator. 
UF students are paying $12.38 per 
credit hour in activity and service fees, 
compared to last year’s fees of $10.65 
per credit hour, a result of the Florida Legislature’s decision to lift a cap that prevented tuition and fees from rising more than 5 percent each year. 
For 2010 to 2011 only, the Higher Ed-
ucation Conforming Bill allows public universities in Florida to increase their fees up to 15 percent or by the amount 
needed to reach the state average.
This year’s increased activity and 
service fees added $1.56 million to the 
UF Activity and Service Fees budget. 
Of these funds, $747,842 will be 
distributed to the Reitz Union to sup-port additional staff to oversee student 
groups, and $812,155 will be distributed 
to RecSports to help pay for the South-west Recreation Center expansion and for additional staff. By JON SILMAN

A Gainesville man shot six people and then killed 
himself in an east Gainesville shooting spree on 
Monday.
One victim was killed, and the other five were in 
surgery as of Monday night, police said in a press 
conference.
The suspect is Clifford Miller Jr., 24, who was 
found with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head in a red Chevrolet truck at 2306 SE 46th Ter -
race.
Police were flooded with 911 calls between 4:03 
p.m. and 4:16 p.m. as Miller rampaged through east Gainesville. The shootings took place at six separate locations within a three-mile radius.
Police said they do not yet know the 
relationship between the victims and 
the suspect. Neighbors and witnesses 
said they believed Miller was specifi-
cally targeting at least some of the victims.
One of the houses where a body was found, 914 
SE 10th Ave., is the residence of the suspect’s father, Clifford L. Miller Sr., 52. Family and neighbors said the suspect killed his father, but police would not yet confirm the victim’s name.
All of the victims were adult males, and their inju-
ries ranged from “minor to very serious,” according to Lt. Steve Maynard of the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office.
Police said they do not yet have a motive for the 
shooting.Shooter attacks six before killing himself

The state legislature has awarded UF 
$600,000 in research grants to fund alter -
native energy and health care technology 
research.
In the spring, the legislature allocated 
$2 million to fund the commercialization of products and technologies that result from university research. 
Twenty-one projects from 10 state uni-
versities were approved to receive part of the funding. 
Four projects will be based at UF, which 
is receiving the largest award out of the 10 
universities.
“At UF, we certainly have the largest research enterprise in the state,” said UF spokesman Steve Orlando.
One of the UF projects aims to market 
a new technology that allows medical pro-
viders to track prescribed pills or capsules and make sure patients are adhering to a medication regimen.
Another will try to produce a market-
ready, portable energy-generating unit 
using an alterna-
tive fuel cell tech-
nology.
Orlando said 
the grant further bolsters the uni-versity’s contin-ued focus on re-search.UF grant take tops chart

palace in Quito, Ecuador, Monday. Ecuador is under a state of siege, with the military in charge of public order, after soldiers rescued Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa Thursday from a hospital where he’d been surrounded by police who roughed him up and tear-gassed him earlier.
� VIOLATORS WERE WARNED.

Alligator Staff Writer
The Student Government Election 
Commission voted unanimously to 
let election code violators off with a warning Monday night.
The commission considered two 
election complaints filed during last week’s SG election. 
The first complaint accused Stu-
dent Alliance party spokesman Yevgen Sautin and independent 
Sen. Neil Gundavda of distributing 
unregistered and unapproved fliers around campus. The fliers misrep-resented the platform of the Unite Party. 
Sen. Alan Ya-
nuck, who ran independently this semester and 
filed the complaint, said the defen-dants had committed “obvious vio-lations.”
The four-member council gave each of the accused persons a warn-
ing, citing a lack of hard evidence for 
a harsher punishment.
The second complaint was filed 
because 10 independent candidates turned in their campaign finance reports late or not at all. They  also received warnings.
All complaints previously filed 
by members of the Unite Party were 
dropped before the meeting.
Before the meeting adjourned, 
the committee voted to validate the 
results of the election.SG votes to let election violations slide� IT RECEIVED A $10.6-MILLION GRANT.

A little more than a month after setting a new re-
cord for riders in a single day, Regional Transit Sys-
tem has broken its record for riders in a month and riders in a single year. 
The news was followed by the announcement  
that the company is receiving a $10.6 million grant from the Department of Transportation to build a new maintenance facility and expand the fleet by 25 buses.
“It really got everybody energized over here in the 
office,” said Chip Skinner, spokesman for RTS. 
During the month of the September, about 1.15 
million people rode RTS buses, breaking the previous record set in 2009 by 31,042 riders.
September is RTS’ busiest month because of the 
large influx of new students on campus, according to Skinner. “It’s a great benefit to have our partnership with 
the University of Florida,” he said. “We couldn’t have broken that record without the faculty, students and staff of UF choosing public transit and choosing the 
green option for their transportation needs.” 
About 9.37 million people rode the bus from Oct. 
1, 2009 to the same date this year, breaking the previ-
ous year’s record by about 300,000 riders. 
Construction on the new facility could begin as 
soon as 2011, and Skinner estimated the facility would 
be completed by 2013. 
“With the expansion of fleets and the facility, hope-
fully we will be able to expand on the number of routes and the service that we provide to the public,” 
he said.RTS to add 25 buses, build new facilityBy KIMBERLY DEWITT

The Student Health Care Center kicked off its 2010 
Influenza Campaign with free flu vaccinations Monday 
for UF students at the Reitz Union. 
Kelly Mitchell, registered nurse and coordinator of 
the campaign, said the center ordered 10,000 doses of the vaccine this year, twice as many as last year. In 2009, 
all 5,000 doses were used and Mitchell hopes students, 
faculty and staff will once again take advantage of the 
services.
“In the past we have had shortage issues and delayed 
shipping problems,” she said. “Rarely does everything 
go exactly as planned. But so far so good for now, al-
though it’s only the first day.”
John Hinchee, a fifth-year environmental science stu-
dent, was one of the many students who received the 
shot Monday. 
No stranger to the illness, Hinchee contracted the 
H1N1 virus, or swine flu, last year while studying 
abroad in Australia.
“The fourteen-hour plane ride home from Australia 
was rough,” he said. “I’d much rather have the flu shot this year than have to deal with that nonsense again.”
The vaccines are free to students but are available to 
employees for $25. Outreach clinics accept cash or check 
only.Campus offers

While some may view the combination of slashed bud-
gets and skyrocketing costs as the death knell for the af-
fordable college education in America, U.S. Secretary of 
Education Arne Duncan sees it as nothing more than an-other round of challenges for what he still considers the greatest educational system in the world. 
In a phone conference Monday, Duncan reassured stu-
dent reporters that the  government is doing all it can to keep students in school at a reasonable price. 
“[A college education] has never been more important,” 
Duncan said. “But it’s never been more expensive.” 
While Duncan acknowledged problems within the edu-
cational system like keeping costs down and preparing students to finish college, he pointed to increases in federal funding and the simplifying of the Free Application for 
Federal Student Aid as positive signs. 
The conference call was sponsored by 
MTV and the College Board as a part of their “Get Schooled College Affordability 
Challenge,” which allows students from 
across the nation to propose new ideas 
to  revamp the financial aid system. 
Gaston Caperton, former governor of 
West Virginia and current president of The College Board, said a lot of the prob-
lems facing the American educational system are due to a combination of overspending and failing to save. 
A solution may hinge on the federal government’s abil-
ity to raise taxes, he said. He acknowledged that some 
Americans may not appreciate such a measure, but he said 
a better-educated America would outweigh the cost.
“It wasn’t the popular thing to do, but it was the right 
thing to do,” he said.Secretary of ed.

Rick Parker has spent more than a 
quarter of a century working for people 
who can’t afford to hire a lawyer. Now, he’s moving to Afghanistan to train young Afghan lawyers.
Rick Parker, 63, has served as the 
Eighth Judicial Circuit public defender in Alachua County since 1984. 
Now, he’ll train  lawyers through 
Pacific Architects and Engineers Inc., a private company under contract with the U.S. State Department.
It all started in May when he re-
ceived an e-mail through the Florida 
Public Defenders Association from PAE 
Inc. with one-year job opportunities for those interested in serving as criminal defense advisers in Afghanistan. 
Parker had recently decided with his 
wife Kathy that he was not going to run for re-election in 2012.
“Part of the problem of looking for a 
new job is that sometimes you find one 
before you’re really ready to take it,” he  
said. “I don’t think the position will be available if I wait, so I’ve decided to take advantage of the unique opportunity.”
The exact duties and responsibilities 
of the job will be unknown to Parker un-til he is approved for flight and arrives in Kabul, Afghanistan. The company has offices in seven other provinces, and 
Parker could end up at any of them.
The goal, Parker said, is to create a stable nation that can resist the Taliban 
and deny a home to al-Qaida.
“If we can accomplish those things, 
it will make Europe and America both safer places to live,” he said.
Parker had a previous interest in 
Afghanistan and was familiar with the U.S. mission there. Parker works with a man who served two one-year contracts in Afghanistan and a woman whose husband is in Afghanistan now. Parker talked with the woman’s husband about his experiences.
“Looking at his pictures and getting 
to talk to him about it, I thought it was 
a very noble thing to do,” Parker said.
“We’re going to 
be doing the best 
we can to stay away from the dangerous situations,” Parker said. One risk, he 
said, is roadside 
bombs. The lawyers 
will travel in armored vehicles.
“I feel blessed to have this chance to 
do something that I consider to be help-ful, while at the same time challenging myself to do something totally different than what I’m used to,” he said.
He isn’t sure when he’ll fly to Af-
ghanistan, but he expects it will be be-fore the end of the year.  As for the open position of public defender, Parker said Stacy Scott, an assistant public defender in Alachua County, will be his recom-mendation to Gov. Charlie Crist.Defender retires to teach

50% NOMonday’s question: Did you stop watching the UF-Alabama game before it ended?Today’s question: Do you watch “Teen Mom”?Sixth Amendment, 
Schmixth Amendment!
In a New York Uni-
versity law school report released Monday, of the 15 
states with the highest pris-
on populations, one of those being our very own penal-fail peninsula, 13 imposed some hefty charges for those seeking public defendants.
In an obvious contrast 
to the Sixth Amendment, which states the accused 
shall “have the Assistance 
of Counsel for his [or her] defense,” the finding obvi-ously flips T. Jefferson and ole’ Mr. Madison over in their graves.
Although the sixth in-
stallment in the Bill of Rights doesn’t explicitly say coun-
sel should be provided free 
of charge, the study finds poorer criminals will, in ef-fect, have worse representa-tion and a higher chance of wrongful conviction as they are unable to afford some of the public defenders’ rates that can reach nearly $1,300.
The American Civil Lib-
erties Union has spoken out after the study’s release, say-ing the study labels Ameri-ca, where liberty and justice 
for all are supposedly super 
important, as a two-tiered system of justice where rich Americans have a greater chance of accessing fair le-gal representation.
But then again, the Na-
tional Districts Attorney As-sociation said it’s “only fair” 
dirt poor criminals should 
have to fork up the dough they don’t have. 
This study tells us all one 
thing about America’s val-ues: Greed is good. 
Apparently so good it 
trumps constitutionality.
Everyone deserves equal 
representation no matter how many Benjamins he or she can fork over.Fare trials ‘Teen Mom’ signals demise of America
Everybody with cable TV and a proclivity toward 
captivating car-wreck television has an opinion on the sorta-famous young mothers on MTV’s 
“Teen Mom,” but this week marks the first time police started a case against someone based solely on what the baby momma did on MTV .
MTV giveth, and MTV taketh away. 
“Teen Mom” is a runaway hit television show that 
may or may not glamorize teen pregnancy. 
The only things I’m sure “Teen Mom” glamorizes 
are wearing sweatpants and completely ignoring your 
children.
However, an Indiana girl named Amber Portwood is 
currently under investigation by police and Child Pro-tective Services in her hometown for mercilessly beat-ing her baby daddy, Gary Shirley, in the last episode of 
this season’s “Teen Mom.”
If the police decide to rewind the DVR and watch 
the rest of this season, they may just take away Port-
wood’s baby and place it in a more safe and secure loca-tion where it can have a better chance at a normal life 
— somewhere like an industrial mine in Mongolia or 
inside a den of angry bears.
The bears would easily recognize the child’s father as 
one of their own, as he is roughly the size of a teenage 
grizzly and hibernates for half the year. Bears, though, 
would be immediately disappointed in Shirley’s work ethic and inability to do anything remotely productive in life other than pick up ugly girls in the diaper aisle at Walmart. 
Portwood and Shirley are just one of the four sets of 
parents on “Teen Mom” who have agreed to have every detail of their depressing lives scrutinized by millions of people.
  In exchange for a sniff of what 
passes for fame in the Facebook 
Age, these improbable American 
idols reveal every torturous mo-ment to a global television audi-ence and provide endless digital 
fodder in the form of video clips 
and message-board material.
We watched as Portwood was brought to tears by a 
particularly vexing computerized GED test and cringed as she screamed at her baby for being too needy and 
weepy. 
A nation held its collective breath as Shirley excruci-
ated over the most important decision he makes on any 
given day — pizza or hot wings.
I guess all the world’s a stage, and the men and 
women are merely players. 
But it is still important to note the above passage did 
not originate in a song by Drake or Kanye.
It is a hallmark of modern American society when we 
have the ability to boil down complex issues that bleed across numerous socio-economic and cultural boundar -
ies into a twaddling tweet or a “Like” button.  
Yet the struggles of teen moms make for such com-
pelling material precisely because they are such a per -
sonal and sensitive matter, and societies exist largely to shelter and hopefully cultivate stronger bonds than the ones we see strained by the cartoonish violence of a dumb, chunky girl on MTV .
Et tu, Amber?Tommy Maple is an international communications

Sexy Studies
Teens using condoms 
more often
Americans are having a lot of sex. 
And things are getting freakier and friskier. 
The National Survey of Sexual Health and Behav-
ior, which appeared in the Journal of Sexual Medicine Monday , 
paints one of the largest and naughtiest images of America’s 
collective sex life, and some of the results are, well, just keep reading.
America is stretching the limits of its definition of normal 
and lubing it up with a side of cherry-flavored kinky . 
According to the study, respondents participated in a rep-
ertoire of more than 40 hide-your-eyes sex acts and positions during their most recent sexual encounter. 
Forty? We must be a bunch of prudes, but we got stuck nam-
ing positions at about 17. Good work, America! Happy hump-ing! 
Fifteen percent of respondents also reported having a sexual 
history involving at least some same-sex action. Interestingly , 
only 7 percent of those respondents reported their sexuality as 
something “other than heterosexual.”
And in a nod to the lovable Bill Clinton and his tagline more 
famous than “not inhaling,” America seems to also be having a hard (so many puns) time defining what dirty deeds can be 
called sex. 
And the study makes us proud of kiddies across the nation. 
According to the study, 83 percent of teens reported using a 
condom during their most recent sexual encounter. But only 22 
percent of adult males reported wrapping up. 
So keep passing out those free condoms, GatorWell.And remember, Gators, if you don’t use one, like the 83 per -
cent of teens who do, you will get pregnant, and you will die.

letters@alligator.orgTUESDAY, OCTOBER 5, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 7
I am furious and cannot keep silent any longer. For 
those who are not aware, there has been a series of suicides over the last few weeks with a com-
mon theme: people who were being harassed for their sexuality. We all (or at least should) remember Matthew Shepard, the gay student at the University of Wyoming who was brutally beaten and left on a 
split-rail fence in the middle of nowhere to die. 
His horrific death prompted a wave of hate-crime 
awareness and led to attempts to codify anti-hate 
crime legislation in the form of the Matthew Shepard Act. This was in 1998. This act wasn’t passed until 
2009. Why? 
Because our nation does not view gay and lesbian 
people as human beings deserving of equality and 
acceptance. 
It’s been 12 years since Shepard’s gruesome 
death, and one might think progress has been made in the area of protection against hate crimes. Well, it hasn’t. 
The nation was shocked in February 2008 when 
Lawrence King, a 15-year-old middle school student, was shot in the head by a 14-year-old student while at school. He was shot because he had attempted to befriend someone who had been taught that gay 
people were evil, that gay people were not human. 
This prompted another wave of media coverage and lent enough credence to get the Matthew Shepard Act passed in 2009. 
Once again, the nation could sweep this issue un-
der the rug because gay and lesbian people had got-ten their protection, and we could go back to worry-ing about the latest season of “American Idol.”
Lawrence King has faded from the collective mind 
of the public, and new issues occupy our attention. Yet again, the issue of anti-gay harassment raises its brutish head, in an even more shocking event. 
This time, an 11-year-old student hanged him-
self. There are people on this campus with children around that age. How would you feel, parents, if you came home and your child had killed himself or her -
self? How would you feel, especially, if you knew of 
the issue that caused this and had repeatedly noti-
fied your child’s school, but the school did nothing to stop this harassment?
This is what happened in Massachusetts in April 
2009.Carl Joseph Walker-
Hoover, unable to bear the load of daily torment by his classmates, took his 
own life. His mother notified the school weekly lead-ing up to this, pleading with it to step in and stop this harassment.
All this does is say to survivors, “Your child was 
not worthy of protection, and your child is not wor -
thy of remembrance.”
I’m going to list some names of children who 
are now dead because of harassment based on their sexual orientation. July 9, Justin Aaberg, 15, Min-
nesota, hanged himself after continual harassment 
at school. Sept. 9, Billy Lucas, 15, Indiana, hanged himself after being constantly tormented at school, with the full knowledge of the administration. Sept. 19, Seth Walsh, 13, California, hanged himself after 
being forced to transfer schools due to harassment 
over his sexuality. Sept. 22, Tyler Clementi, 18, fresh-man at Rutgers University, New Jersey, jumped from a bridge after his roommate broadcast him be-
ing intimate with another man over his Facebook 
and Twitter feed. Sept. 23, Asher Brown, 13, Texas, 
shot himself in the head after continual harassment 
at school. Sept. 29, Raymond Chase, 19, openly gay sophomore at Johnson and Wales University, Rhode Island, hanged himself in unknown circumstances in 
his dorm room.
Did we take any impact from Matthew Shepard? 
From Larry King? From Carl Joseph Walker-Hoover? 
Did we change the casual nature of homophobic slang in our culture? Did we recognize we needed to 
do something about this issue? No.
Now we have six more deaths on our hands. Six 
children dead for senseless, thoughtless reasons. Let 
this be a lesson to us all. Words and actions have real-world consequences. Let us not have these children lose their lives in vain. 
I hope you will join me in an effort to stop ha-
rassment, stop violence and let the families of these children and other children who are struggling with the same issues know we are committed to finding a 
solution to this increasingly dangerous problem.
We cannot let another child die because of our 
negligence.

Speaking OutColumnist misses point about Fox News
Chris Dodson’s criticism of President Barack Obama’s 
campaign against Fox misses the point. 
MSNBC is certainly partisan, but that does not mean it 
has anything in common with Fox. 
There is a difference between being  partisan and ly-
ing. 
On health care, Fox lied.
MSNBC got it right. On the  New York City mosque, Fox unabashedly em-
ployed racism and hate-mongering.
MSNBC employed compassion and common sense.  
From a fact-checking point of view, Fox and MSNBC have nothing in common. 
MSNBC could probably do its message a favor and 
tone down the sensationalism. 
However, if methods of research and journalism with 
a sense of integrity lead an organization to support one party over another, as displayed with NPR, we should be careful not to mistake this happening for partisan  hack-ery. 
I encourage anyone who disagrees to fact check Fox 
News and MSNBC.

Free market leads to tragic effects
William Tew’s Monday letter to the editor and his sug-
gestion that socialist governments have more frequently 
brain-washed their citizens than capitalist governments 
should be called into question.
Tew should be reminded he lives in a country which, 
through the CIA, has actively sabotaged the economies 
of dozens of leftist countries around the world, surrepti-
tiously started wars that have killed millions of people, 
overthrown dozens of democratically elected leaders, staged public opinion polls and planted newspaper arti-cles mostly at the direction of the capitalist-spawned U.S. corporations that wanted to sell their products in those 
countries. 
Indeed, the free market gives fruitful results in many 
industries, but tragic effects occur when unfettered profit 
pursuit drives all business activity.

 THE UF DEFENSE WILL 
FACE THE SEC’S LEADING RUSHER SATURDAY.
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator.org
 
After being what he called “a 
serviceable backup” for three 
years, Duke Lemmens has found a home in Florida’s defense.
When the Gators use their 
run-stopping scheme, Lemmens moves from defensive end to strongside linebacker, a role that gives him more ground to cover 
and more responsibility as the 
hybrid player in UF’s heavy pack-age.
“It’s definitely been a long time 
since I didn’t have my hand in the 
dirt,” Lemmens said. “It makes 
me feel like an athlete again.”
He has to be. The 6-foot-3, 
250-pounder is responsible for 
getting past the opposing tight 
end to stop run plays and provid-ing support against the passing game. 
That requires more versatil-
ity than his main position on the end of the line, but Lemmens has made the transition smoothly.
He racked up a career-high 
eight tackles — seven in the first half — during Saturday’s loss at Alabama, topping the previ-
ous high he set in the first game he played in the heavy package against Tennessee.
“The two games he played, 
Tennessee and this one, he kind 
of had [career games] because he was using his athleticism to run 
all over the place and be a highly-
energized guy,” UF coach Urban Meyer said. “He played extreme-ly well — played his best game.”
Meyer will need the senior to 
replicate that performance this weekend against LSU. For the third time in four games, the Gators will face the Southeastern 
Conference’s leading rusher.
The Tigers’ Stevan Ridley 
holds that distinction with 557 yards and four touchdowns in five games (5.7 yards per carry), 
and he’s coming off a 123-yard performance against Tennessee.
“Their back is a tough one,” 
Meyer said. “He’s tough and 
physical. That’s where they’re go-
ing to go with it, or we’re guess-ing that’s the direction they’re go-ing to head.”
Meyer and defensive coordi-
nator Teryl Austin had the same feeling about what the Crimson Tide would try to do on offense: pound the ball with running 
backs Mark Ingram and Trent 
Richardson.
The Gators countered with the 
heavy package, and the results 
were mixed.
The Tide’s backfield duo com-
bined for 110 yards after putting 
up 242 the previous week against 
Arkansas, but 89 of those yards 
and two touchdowns in the first half helped build a 24-3 lead. 
Meyer was happy with his de-
fense’s handling of Ingram and Richardson, especially because the Gators improved upon the 22 missed tackles from last year’s SEC title game.
“[Alabama’s running backs] 
were way below what they ex-pect,” Meyer said. “Six missed tackles is what I go through. That 
was our whole thing last week, 
and we tackled well.”TUESDAY, OCTOBER 5, 2010  ALLIGATOR, 13

Nick Waisome committed to UF in 
August, but he’s not done with the 
recruiting process quite yet.
No, the four-star cornerback out 
of Groveland South Lake High isn’t 
considering other offers. He ‘s trying 
to recruit an old friend to join him at 
Florida next season. 
Waisome, the No. 11 cornerback 
in the nation according to Rivals.com, and Ha’Sean Clinton-Dix, the 
top safety in this year’s class, both 
attended Lockhart Middle School in Orlando, where the two were best friends.
Clinton-Dix, from Orlando Dr. 
Phillips High, committed in April to play at Alabama. But that hasn’t stopped Waisome from trying to lure him to Florida before National Sign-
ing Day on Feb. 2.
“I’ve been talking to him, trying to 
get him on board,” Waisome said af-
ter his team’s 44-7 home loss to Apo-
pka Olympia High on Friday. 
In that game he had three tackles 
and one pass breakup in the end zone 
— the only time Olympia threw the ball in his direction.
Early in September, Clinton-Dix 
said he was 95 percent committed to the Crimson Tide, but his one-time close friend has been in his ear since committing to the Gators in August.
Since then, Clinton-Dix has soft-
ened his solid verbal, even if just slightly. He told the Orlando Sentinel last month he was only 85 percent 
committed to Alabama.
“I’m still ‘Bama, but the Gators are 
on a run with me,” Clinton-Dix told 
the Sentinel at the time.
Waisome, who said he is 100 per -
cent Florida, isn’t giving up on his 
former schoolmate just yet. When the two were in middle 
school together, they 
used to play sandlot football after classes 
and were close until Waisome moved and they lost contact with each oth-
er.
The two highly-touted recruits re-
connected at tryouts for the Central 
Florida All-Stars 7-on-7 team earlier 
this year and were teammates on the 
Southeast team that won the ESPN RISE Gridiron Kings tournament this summer. 
Now, with their senior seasons in 
full swing and college approaching, Waisome is hoping the friends can once again be schoolmates and re-unite on the field.
“I’m just trying to get him over to the Gators and be part of the family,” Waisome said. 
That family includes three-star 
defensive back De’Ante “Pop” Saun-ders, as well as four-star linebacker Ryan Shazier and four-star quarter -
back Jeff Driskel, the nation’s top 
pro-style passer. 
All of them are UF commits with 
whom Waisome has built strong re-
lationships. He said they all talk on a regular basis and exchange text mes-
sages to get to know each other better 
before they enroll at UF. 
While Clinton-Dix is the only one 
Waisome is trying to recruit right 
now, he said there’s a chance he will 
“get on a couple of other cats later,” and try to get them to commit to UF — a role similar to the one freshman Trey Burton played in last year’s class.
“There ain’t nowhere else to go,” 
Waisome said. “The Gators is where it’s at.” Commit helping out in recruiting process“It’s definitely been a long 
time since I didn’t have my 
hand in the dirt. It makes 
me feel like an athlete 
again.”

TEEING OFF WITH KYLE MAISTRI UF BASKETBALL alligatorSports podcast GATORS COMMITTED TWO TURNOVERS IN 
THE RED ZONE AGAINST ALABAMA.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator.org
 
The Gators won the yardage and time of possession 
battles Saturday against the Crimson Tide, but Florida 
still lost the game.
UF’s struggles inside the red zone were the biggest 
reason for that.
Of four opportunities inside the Alabama 20-yard line, 
two resulted in field goals and two resulted in turnovers.
An interception in Alabama’s end zone and a botched 
handoff on Alabama’s one-yard line ruined two chances to put points on the scoreboard.
“The red-zone scoring, that’s a whole different ball 
game,” coach Urban Meyer said. “If we don’t throw those picks and have red-zone efficiency, we are in that 
[game].”
No. 14 Florida used freshman wildcat quarterback 
Trey Burton near the goal line again Saturday. But instead of scoring six touchdowns like he did against Kentucky 
the week prior, Burton threw an interception in the end zone on a 4th-and-goal jump pass.
“I knew it was on the road, I knew points were going 
to be at a premium against that offense,” Meyer said of the play call. “We had significant momentum going there 
so we wanted to score touchdowns.”
The next red-zone turnover came in the third quarter 
when quarterback John Brantley tripped over offensive lineman Carl Johnson and fumbled the exchange with 
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
On the first drive of the game UF freshman Trey Burton attempted a jump pass near the goal line on fourth down. But 
the pass was intercepted, one of the Gators’ two turnovers in the red zone.
Red-zone struggles a concern for Florida’s offense
SEE NOTEBOOK, p AGE 16
Like several other aspects of this 
season, Florida’s loss last Satur -
day immediately drew compar -
isons to another moment in the Urban Meyer era.
The John Brantley-Trey Burton dy-
namic became Chris Leak-Tim Tebow ‘10. Firesteveaddazio.com launched two years after the “Fire Dan Mullen” Facebook page was created. And now Florida’s loss to Alabama is the hip, new version of the Ole Miss Promise-gate of 2008.
These comparisons are often born 
out of laziness and naivety — those who ignore the past are not, in fact, doomed to repeat it. But while the first two comparisons at least hold some merit, the third is a wishful oversimplification.
Yes, the Gators turned the ball 
over too much in both losses. Yes, play calling was questioned. And, yes, the defense s u r r e n d e r e d back-breaking touchdowns.
But, beyond 
those elements, comparing the two games is a stretch.
Against Ole 
Miss, Florida fumbled the 
ball three times, gave up a long, go-ahead touchdown pass late in the 
fourth quarter, let a Rebel block the 
should-have-been game-tying extra point and was stuffed on a predict-able, 4th-and-1 Tebow dive.
Remove one of those elements, any 
one of them, and the Gators win.
Against Alabama on Saturday, Don’t compare loss to others

In the first round of qualifying, junior 
Nassim Slilam did something that no UF 
player had done in more than a year — post a straight-sets 6-0, 6-0 win. 
Slilam’s win against No. 69 Daniel Stahl 
of Notre Dame was the first of its kind since Alexandre Lacroix defeated South Florida’s Wael Kilani on Sept. 25, 2009, in the Gator Invitational. 
Slilam’s dominating victory at the ITA 
All-American in Tulsa, Okla., impressed coach Andy Jackson. 
“Nassim beat the No. 69 guy in the coun-
try and beat him very badly,” Jackson said. 
It was also a successful day for sopho-
more Sekou Bangoura Jr., who battled for three rounds against Texas Tech’s Rafael Garcia before earning a victory (6-2, 3-6, 6-4). 
Jackson said Bangoura played extremely tough in what was a long, difficult match. 
Both Bangoura and Slilam will play in 
round two on Tuesday, while Bangoura 
will also play in doubles qualifying with 
Billy Federhofer.
Bangoura was originally scheduled to 
play with Bob van Overbeek, who had to 
be replaced after getting the flu. 
The doubles pairs need 
three wins in qualifying 
to advance to the 32-team main draw.
Even though this is the 
first time Federhofer and Bangoura will play to-gether, Jackson said it will 
only help develop chemis-
try for the spring. 
Through three days of action, the 
Gators’ coach is pleased with his team’s 
performance, particularly that of freshman 
Andrew Butz. Slilam wins in straight sets

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
NEWPORT, Wales — Graeme McDowell 
capped off an unforgettable year for himself 
— and for Europe.
In a Ryder Cup that came down to the 
very last match Monday, McDowell rolled in a 15-foot birdie putt on the 16th hole, then closed out Hunter Mahan to give Europe the 
14.5 points it needed to reclaim the precious gold trophy.
It was the first time since 1991 that the 
Ryder Cup was decided by the final singles 
match, a thriller made possible by the Ameri-
cans getting big wins from their best players and a stunning comeback by 21-year-old 
rookie Rickie Fowler.
Leave it to McDowell, the U.S. Open 
champion, to deliver another career-defining 
moment.
Under far greater pressure than he faced 
at Pebble Beach, he turned back the Ameri-can rally with a birdie putt that seemed to take forever to reach the hole until it tumbled 
into the cup and set off a ground-shaking 
roar at Celtic Manor.
“Graeme McDowell was put there for a 
good reason — he’s full of confidence, and that showed,” European captain Colin Mont-
gomerie said. “That birdie on 16 was just quite unbelievable. Quite unbelievable.”
So was the finish.
Europe, ahead by three points going into 
the final round, took the early lead in eight of 
the nine matches and appeared on its way to 
another rout on home soil. But it all turned so quickly.
Tiger Woods holed out from the fairway 
for eagle during a seven-hole stretch that he 
played in 7-under par. Steve Stricker won the 
opening match, and Phil Mickelson built a big lead to win late. Then came Fowler, the 
first PGA Tour rookie to play in the Ryder 
Cup, winning the last three holes with bird-ies — including putts of 15 feet on the 17th and 18th — to earn an improbable halve 
against Edoardo Molinari.
That gave the Americans 13.5 points, and 
they only needed a halve in the last match 
to retain the cup. Just as Fowler was being 
mobbed by his teammates, 
Mahan made a nervy birdie putt on the 15th to cut Mc-
Dowell’s lead to one up.
“The U.S. Open felt like 
a back nine with my dad 
back at Portrush compared 
to that,” McDowell said. “I 
was really nervous there. Wow! It’s a different feel-
ing. It’s just so much pressure.”
It sure didn’t look that way as he blasted 
a tee shot down the middle and hit his ap-proach to 15 feet, leaving him a quick putt.
“The best putt I’ve hit in my life,” Mc-
Dowell said.After a week of rain that forced the first 
Monday finish in Ryder Cup history, more 
showers soon followed — only these came 
from bottles of champagne sprayed in every 
direction.
“It’s been the best week of my life,” said 
Rory McIlroy, who holed a five-foot par putt on the 18th hole to earn a half-point against Stewart Cink that turned out to be crucial.
Montgomerie is renowned for a career 
missing only a major. This felt like one, may-be even better.
“This is one of the finest moments of my 
golfing — wait a minute — this is the greatest 
moment of my golfing career,” he said.
Europe thrives on winning the Ryder 
Cup, yet this year went beyond the match-es. McDowell won the U.S. Open, and 
Martin Kaymer of Germany won the PGA Championship, the first time two Euro-
peans have won majors in the same year 
since 1999.McDowell sinks birdie putt to help clinch cup for Europe

Junior Nassim Slilam became the first UF player to record 
a double-bagel victory in more than a year Monday.
Two Gators off to second round of qualifying
Butz advanced to the final round of 
prequalifying before losing to Georgia 
Tech’s Dean O’Brien on Sunday. 
Jackson said a player’s performance 
in the tournament can be judged on two factors — who he beat and whether who he lost to continues to perform.
“Andrew had a good tournament,” 
Jackson said. “He beat the No. 2  guy for TCU, a top-four guy for Georgia Tech and lost to a guy who is still playing,” Jackson said.
With two players advancing to quali-
fying and good performances by the two freshmen, Jackson is excited about the rest of the week. 
“I’m very pleased with our team and 
the way we’re working and looking for -
ward to continuing it,” he said.TENNIS , from page 14Meyer looking for leaders to step up; Gillislee listed as probable
running back Emmanuel Moody.
Part of the problem was a lack of balance 
with the play-calling. The Gators ran the ball 
eight times and threw it just three times when they were inside the Tide’s 20-yard line.
Leaders need to emerge: Meyer is play-
ing the waiting game.
After the loss against Alabama, some 
players were vocal in the locker room. But Meyer won’t know who the team’s leaders are until Saturday’s game against No. 12 LSU. 
“Some leadership really stepped up in 
there,” he said. “But it’s easy to stand up and say something. Now you have to be a grown 
man and back everything up. So I’m anxious 
to watch them.”
Senior center Mike Pouncey was one of 
the players who made his voice heard after the loss, but he reiterated there isn’t a clear leader on the team just yet.“A lot of people said a lot of things,” 
Pouncey said. “The main message was just believe in each other and we’ll get through 
this tough loss.”
Following UF’s loss to Au-
burn in 2006, Meyer said he 
remembers a lot of players 
screaming and yelling. After its loss to Ole Miss in 2008, he 
remembers a dejected group.
But this time, he is still waiting for leaders 
to step up.“[The leaders are] to be determined,” he 
said. “There were some good things said, but we all can walk up and say good things.”
Injuries: After Saturday’s crushing loss, 
the Gators finally received some good news.
Running back Mike Gillislee, who stood 
on the sideline with crutches the entire sec-ond half, was diagnosed with a bone bruise after many thought he suffered a high ankle 
sprain. Meyer said he is probable for Satur -
day’s game against LSU. NOTEBOOK , from page 14
Florida lost the turnover battle 
4-0, allowed the Tide good field position early (two touchdown drives starting in the Gators’ territory), only converted 23 
percent of third downs, man-
aged just three points in four red-zone possessions and failed to stop Alabama’s offense in-side the Florida 20-yard line (24 points in four possessions).
Remove one of those ele-
ments, any one of them, and the Gators still lose. If Meyer 
and Co. hopped in a  DeLorean 
and returned to Saturday night, they would need to fix most, if not all, of those problems.
Fans want this loss to rival 
the Ole Miss contest because, in retrospect, few losses have inspired a team or its follow-ers the way that game did. Few teams have been ignited like the Gators were, averaging more than 45 points in the 10 games 
after their meltdown against 
the Rebels.
But that team had already 
flashed potential. Its quarter -
back had won the Heisman, one of its receivers was integral in the ‘06 championship run and its defense returned eight of its top-10 tacklers from the season before.
An underachieving Florida 
team lost to Ole Miss 31-30 be-
fore realizing its potential. This 
year’s Florida team lost 31-6.
Center Mike Pouncey said 
Florida beat itself last weekend and, depending on your out-look, that’s true. But can’t fans look at a lot of losses that way? Aren’t most games decided by a few pivotal plays when one 
team succeeds and the other 
doesn’t? 
And that’s giving Florida 
too much credit. The Gators did not lose because of a few costly mistakes. They lost because of 25 points’ worth of mistakes.
Good teams, even champi-
onship teams, have occasion-
ally “cost themselves” a game. 
The 2008 team did. But don’t view that season, or any other in the past five years, as a blue-print. If the Gators did actually beat themselves by 25 points, have a lot to work on.
And no paved path to fol-
low.TYLER , from page 14Football

ment. He beat the No. 2 two guy
