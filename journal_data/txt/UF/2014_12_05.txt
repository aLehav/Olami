One day after a deal for Colorado State 
coach Jim McElwain to become the head 
coach for the Florida football team stalled because of his hefty $7.5-million buyout, an agreement has been reached.
UF announced Thursday that McElwain, the three-year head coach at Colorado State, will serve as the next head coach of the Flor-ida Gators football team. 
In a statement released by UF, McElwain’s 
compensation package from UF will average $3.5 million annually over a six year period.
ESPN’s Chris Low conﬁ  rmed the buyout 
resolution Thursday and Matt Stephens of the Coloradoan conﬁ  rmed the hiring shortly afterward.At 11:19 a.m., Florida 
made it ofﬁ  cial through one of its Twitter account 
(@GatorZoneFB) by tweet-
ing “#GatorNation, we 
are pleased to ofﬁ  cially announce our new head coach…Jim McElwain.”
UF athletics director Jer-
emy Foley said in a state-
ment that McElwain was targeted early in the search process and after vetting, he was 
the obvious choice. 
“He has a proven track record on the of-fensive side of the ball, has coached in the 
SEC, won two national championships and has had success as a head coach,’’ Foley said 
in the statement. “He has recruited the South 
and the state of Florida and has spent time coaching at the highest level in the NFL.
“He has an engaging personality and is 
someone who can connect with a variety of audiences and he operates with a high level of integrity. I welcome him and his family to The Gator Nation and I’m looking forward to working alongside him and his staff as Mackenzie 
Dagostino and the 
UF volleyball team 
open play in the 
NCAA Tournament 
tonight. Read the

Starting in the spring, Bo 
Diddley Community Pla-
za will undergo extensive renovations aimed at mak-ing it the face of downtown Gainesville. 
The makeover will focus on 
the north side of the plaza that faces University Avenue, but the entire plaza will be closed starting March, said Sarah Vidal-Finn, manager of the Gainesville Community Rede-velopment Agency, which is spearheading the project.
The renovations are ex-
pected to take about a year to complete, but when complet-ed, it will bring new features to the area meant to enhance foot trafﬁ  c.
“It really comes down to 
the plaza being utilized more at all times during the day, not just for special events,” Vidal-Finn said. “Ours is kind of dormant during the day.” 
The agency does not have a 
cost estimate yet but has bud-geted more than $1 million for the project.
With the plaza under 
renovation for a year, Vidal-Finn said the agency is work-ing closely with the City of Gainesville to ﬁ  nd alternate locations downtown for the Farmers market and other plaza events. 
Still, the homeless who of-
ten occupy the plaza will have 
to ﬁ  nd a new place to stay, 
said Theresa Lowe, executive 
director of the Alachua Coun-
ty Coalition for the Homeless 
and Hungry. 
Grace Marketplace will be 
encouraging people to move 
to its 2845 NE 39th Ave. loca-
tion, she said. 
“We will spend time on the 
plaza doing outreach for the 
people that are staying there 
so they know there are other 
options for them,” Lowe said. 
Once construction is done, 
she said part of the goal of the 
renovation is that the home-
less won’t return.
“I think the city is hoping 
during the time the renova-
tions are going on, people will 
ﬁ  nd other locations to provide 
the services they are provid-ing downtown,” Lowe said. 
But Vidal-Finn said the 
project will give residents the 
renovations they have been 
asking for over the years.

meetings that we’ve hosted 
over the years, the consistent Bo Diddley to begin

A Gainesville woman was arrest-
ed Wednesday after police said she 
chased two people with a butcher knife and then tried to kick and spit on an ofﬁ  cer.
Chiquita Maria Johnson began ar-
guing with Kanika Kehindi Demps and Latoya Mo-nique Louise King at about 4:30 p.m. near Demps’ residence, locat-ed at 2436 NW 
4th Terrace. The 
26-year-old then 
walked to her nearby home, 
went inside and came out clutching a 10-inch blade, according to a police report.
Johnson paced back and forth in front of her home, still holding the knife. She then walked over to Demps and King and began arguing with them again. Johnson raised the knife over her shoulder “in prepara-tion to perform a stabbing motion,” 
according to the report.
Demps and King told police 
they were afraid Johnson would kill 
them.
Johnson then started running 
toward Demps while still gripping the knife, according to the report. Police: Woman chases two with knifeSEE FOOTBALL, PAGE 14

Students eager to cash in on their ideas can sign 
up for a contest held by the Warrington College of 
Business Administration  by Dec. 15.
Students have a chance a to win up to $25,000 
in the What’s Your Big Idea? 2015 Gator Business Plan Competition, hosted by the Center for Entre-preneurship and Innovation and the College of 
Business.
The competition is open to UF students of all 
majors, and students have the option of competing 
alone or with a team.
“The competition is open to those outside of the 
college, so in the past, we have seen everything from service-oriented businesses to product-ori-ented businesses make it to the top,” said Katha-rine Burks, director of support programs and spe-
cial events for the Warrington College of Business 
Administration.   
During the competition, students will take part 
in a series of elimination rounds, with the ﬁ  nal round being held April 24.
The preliminary round will require competitors 
to submit a basic business plan overview. Judges will then select those business overviews with the highest potential, according to Warrington’s web-
site. Remaining competitors will pitch their ideas 
to investors and present them in front of a live au-dience for a chance to win the grand prize.
The money awarded from the competition will 
help winners turn their ideas into reality and will 
go toward developing the winning business plans.
Students competing will have access to men-
tors and classes in the Business Plan Lab, which will provide resources on how to build a business plan.
Judges will select the best business plans based 
on six major categories, including concept strength, 
market, economics of the business, operations, management team and ﬁ  nancing.
Matt O’Sullivan, a UF ﬁ  nance junior, said the 
competition is a great opportunity.
“It seems like it could be a really good idea. It 
just depends on how original they are looking for you to be,” the 21-year-old said.Have the next big idea? Warrington

to see more events, a greater feel-ing of safety and cleanliness, more activities and vendors on a daily basis and more things to do dur-ing the daytime on the plaza,” she said.
The centerpiece of the renova-
tion will be a water wall, which Vidal-Finn said will run over a mesh curtain on the brick building behind the stage.
“What we are trying to do is 
create an iconic downtown entry-way,” she explained.
The northeast side of the proj-
ect will see the addition of a cafe — similar to The Lunchbox — to attract customers and workers downtown to the plaza. 
The cafe will have ﬂ  oor-to-ceil-
ing windows and a new informa-tion kiosk, which will sell tickets to people looking to rent the plaza for events.
Vidal-Finn said enhancing the 
space for larger events is a major goal. 
A green room will be added 
to the brick building behind the stage to give performers a space to change and prepare for shows, making the plaza better equipped for large performances, Vidal-Finn said. The stage will remain where it is.
The plaza will extend about 9 
feet into the existing bus lane that runs east to west on University Avenue, and a new bus stop with a shelter will be built adjacent to the Alachua County Courthouse. En-hanced bike facilities are also part of the project.
The entire plaza will beneﬁ  t 
from landscaping, painting and pressure washing, too.
“It’s just a great thing for down-
town,” Vidal-Finn said. Demps grabbed a wooden stick to de-
fend herself from Johnson, who was still chasing her with the knife.
Eventually Johnson threw the knife in 
Demps’ direction and went back home.
When police arrived shortly before 
5:30 p.m., Johnson was yelling pro-fanities, ignoring police commands and wrenching her body away from police. Once inside the patrol car, Johnson start-ed kicking the back window. She also yelled at the ofﬁ  cer and tried to spit on him,  according to the report.
Police had to put a spit mask over 
Johnson’s mouth and restrained her. She managed to get out of the spit mask and restraints and began kicking and spit-ting at the ofﬁ  cer again. The ofﬁ  cer had to stop his car and restrain Johnson for a second time before she was taken to jail.
Johnson was arrested on two charg-
es of aggravated assault with a deadly 
weapon without intention to kill and 
one charge of resisting an ofﬁ  cer with violence. She is currently being held on a $75,000 bond.
Johnson has been arrested in the past 
on similar charges. According to Ala-chua County records, on April 1, 2008, she was arrested on charges of resisting an ofﬁ  cer with and without violence, 
assault on an ofﬁ  cer and driving with a 
suspended license.
On July 21, 2010, Johnson was arrest-
ed on charges of leaving the scene of a crash, driving with a suspended license, driving under the inﬂ  uence, disturbing the peace, criminal mischief, battery, battery on an ofﬁ  cer, resisting an ofﬁ  cer without violence and resisting an ofﬁ  cer 
with violence.4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, DECEMBER 5, 2014

Naghmeh Abedini’s two children haven’t 
seen their father in two years. 
In 2012, her husband — Saeed Abedini, a 
pastor — was in Iran settling details about a 
children’s orphanage he was building when 
his trip, which he had made before without incident, was suddenly interrupted by the 
country’s Revolutionary Guard, according to 
Naghmeh’s petition on beheardproject.org.
The pastor was illegally forced into house 
arrest at his parents’ Tehran home for his Christian beliefs before being taken into cus-
tody at Iran’s Evin Prison on Sept. 26, 2012, 
according to the petition.
Today, his wife will speak on a Gainesville 
radio show about her journey to bring him home. Abedini will go on the air with Greg Cassidy, program director of 106.9 the Pulse radio show, at about 7:30 a.m. 
When Abedini initially 
learned of his imprison-ment, she began a national campaign to request help 
from the U.S. government 
and the U.N. to get him re-
leased, which she will ad-dress on the show. 
She has traveled around 
the nation telling her husband’s story to gain support for his release, and she will be in town this weekend for appearances at a brunch Saturday and two church services 
Sunday.

Homegrown acoustic folk trio, 
The Currys, is set to perform at the 
Thomas Center on Wednesday.
The performance is part of the 
Jewel Box Concerts, a series of shows featuring national and inter-national artists from a variety of mu-sical genres, said Russell Etling, in-terim cultural affairs manager of the City of Gainesville Parks, Recreation 
and Cultural Affairs Department.
The concert series is funded through a grant from the state’s Division of Cultural Affairs, Etling said.
“Every artist we’re presenting in 
the series is extremely high caliber,” Etling said. “The acoustics are terrif-ic, and the songwriting is excellent.”
When Joseph Saccocci, vice pres-
ident of Shakerag Culture Center 
Inc., saw the trio play with Grammy 
Award-winning artist Billy Dean in 2010, he became an instant fan.
“They played in the middle of his 
set,” Saccocci said. “Twenty seconds into a song, they entered into this three-part harmony, and I watched everybody on the lawn stand up and applaud.”
Saccocci described the group as a cross between Crosby, Stills & Nash and Simon & Garfunkel.
The Thomas Center will open at 
6:30 p.m., and the show will begin at 7:30 p.m. with opening act Amaral the Magic Man. Homemade Indian dinners from Sarah’s Seasoning will be sold for $4 before the show and through the intermission, and tick-ets will be $15 at the door.

More than 200 Nativity scenes from around 
the world will be on display at the third an-
nual Festival of the Nativity this weekend.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints will host the free public event at its Southwest 24th Avenue chapel Saturday from 1 to 8 p.m. and Sunday from 6 to 9 p.m.  
Darla Scoles, media relations specialist for 
the Gainesville Florida Stake Public Affairs, said 500 to 1,000 people are expected to at-
tend the festival.
“It’s just a way for us to focus on Christ 
at Christmas time and not so much the retail 
side of Christmas and all that that entails,” 
she said. “We put this out as our offering to the community as a way to remind everyone 
what Christmas is all about.”
Depictions of the birth of Christ will be 
showcased in a variety of ways, including on quilts and ornaments, Scoles said.
Musical performances from local groups 
and children’s activities will also be a part of the festival. McKenzie Merchant, of the coun-try-pop group Firefly — who have opened 
for Carrie Underwood and Justin Bieber — will also perform, said Angie Tipton, Latter-
day Saints media relations specialist.
Faith Strasser, a UF tourism, events and 
recreation management junior, said the fes-tival would be a nice way to start the holi-
days.
“It’s so easy to forget what the holidays 
are really about,” the 20-year-old said, “This 
would be a good way to kind of take a step 
back and remember what’s important.”Local church to showcase more than 200 nativity scenes

For the fifth year in a row, UF’s 
College of Medicine increased its 
National Institutes of Health fund-ing.
Funding will be used to support 
activities directed toward cutting-edge research into human biology and disease, wrote Stephen Sugrue, the College of Medicine’s senior as-sociate dean of research affairs, in an email.
“The results of these research 
endeavors contribute to dramatic improvements (in) health care,” he 
said.
The health institute is a medical 
research agency within the Depart-ment of Health and Human Services 
and is the world’s largest source of medical research funding, he said.
In 2011, the agency awarded UF 
$72.1 million, and in 2012, the award increased to $83.9 million. UF re-ceived $88 million for 2014, despite the institute’s budget decrease, ac-
cording to a UF Health Shands Hos-
pital press release.
Sugrue said the grant benefits the university and the health and welfare of the world population and that research grant funding has long been a challenge for universi-ties throughout the country.
“The reputation of the university 
is further enhanced by this remark-able achievement,” Sugrue said.
Ashley Martinez, 23, said that 
she is excited to see how the Col-lege of Medicine will use the grant money.
“I would love for them to help 
fund future health professionals throughout school,” the family, youth and community sciences se-nior said. “They can help us by pro-
viding scholarships, grants and dif-
ferent research opportunities that we can be a part of.”College of Medicine funding increased

Clif Patrick was waiting at 
the airport at about noon Tues-
day for an Uber user to request a ride when an officer asked him to leave. The driver didn’t 
have a permit to be there.
Patrick is one of the app-
powered ride service’s drivers 
currently not allowed to pick up or drop off customers at Gainesville Regional Airport, which means students in need of rides to and from the airport must rely on separate taxi ser-
vices for the time being.
“I was surprised he came 
walking up to my window,” 
Patrick said. “I’m not angry; I didn’t lose a sale.”
Taxicab drivers and their 
companies are required to file for a permit and pay a fee to conduct business at the air-
port — a process Uber has not 
completed, wrote a Gainesville airport spokeswoman Laura Aguiar.
“Without an airport permit, 
any driver from any company is asked to leave,” she said. “We are following the city’s discussions regarding changes 
to the vehicle-for-hire ordi-
nance.”
Uber is currently not on the 
airport’s list of approved ride services allowed to perform pickups and dropoffs at the airport. The list includes 18 services, including Silver Cab, Gainesville Cab Co. and Ga-
torland Taxi, according to the 
airport’s website. 
Aguiar said Gainesville Po-
lice routinely monitors drivers on airport property, making sure they have a permit. 
“Our Airport Police Offi-
cers are working closely with the airport management on the issue,” wrote GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias in an email.
The airport’s vehicle-for-
hire policies have existed since the commercial terminal opened in the 1970s, Aguiar said. 
Since the airport is city 
property, Aguiar said it main-tains operations through fees from airlines, rental car agen-
cies and vehicles for hire in-
stead of local tax dollars. 
“Even passengers pay to 
park in the lots,” she said. “This is a traditional business model for an airport.”
On top of business fees, the

ball coach?Why blacks in US are angry, frustrated
After two grand juries decided not to indict Darren 
Wilson, who killed Michael Brown, or Daniel Pan-taleo, who killed Eric Garner, many Americans were 
shocked and bewildered about how such injustices can carry on in this country. This outrage was followed by phrases 
such as, “I can’t believe this is happening in America,” or 
“How is this happening?”
My response would be that, for years, black people in 
this country have been under siege by the powers that 
be. This level of brutality is nothing new and is only get-ting mainstream attention after the death of Mike Brown, Tamir Rice and Eric Garner, just to name a few. Earlier acts of violence against black people are often ignored or mini-mized by history books and general scholarship.
In the early 1900s, the reconstruction of the South led 
to the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, who terrorized black fami-
lies constantly by bombing black churches and kidnapping 
black children. In 1921, a group of white residents attacked 
the black Greenwood District of Tulsa, Oklahoma. This ra-cially motivated attack was done in part to destroy one of the wealthiest black communities in the country. Hundreds of deaths were recorded. In the 1930s, black people were  lynched and killed for simply trying to vote. In the 1950s, the Jim Crow era reached its peak, allowing police ofﬁ  cers to wantonly invade black homes. The KKK also inﬁ  ltrated the justice and legal systems and had representation in high lev-
els of government. In the 1960s and 1970s, black people were 
denied equal access to quality schools of higher education despite the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court de-cision. During this time, black people were also denied ben-eﬁ  ts from the GI Bill and denied access to loans for houses in white-dominated residential areas. Civil rights leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X and Medgar Evers were assassinated as well. In the 1980s, the racist “war on drugs” started, which disproportionately targeted the mi-
nority community and still continues to do so to this day.
Today, black people are denied equal access to schools 
because of the gradual removal of afﬁ  rmative action from 
the higher education system. Black people in America have to deal with racial micro-aggressions like terms such as “re-verse racism” and “colorblind-ness” or being presumed to be a criminal or a thug.
Additionally, black people are 
still harassed by the police due to 
racial proﬁ  ling and are sometimes 
murdered by the police without any justiﬁ  cation or accountability.
On a personal level, it is difﬁ  -
cult to live in a country where un-
armed black people are killed and then have their character assassinated in the media.
It’s exhausting to see anti-blackness perpetuated every-
where I look, whether it’s on TV or through a friend’s snide 
comment or during a class lecture.
To even remotely begin to understand this experience, 
imagine losing someone you love, and a grand jury decides 
that your loved one’s life isn’t even worth putting his or her killer on trial. It dehumanizes you and disrupts the very es-sence of your being, which only gets worse as the pattern of police brutality continues to go unchecked in other parts of the country.
As a college student, my main concern should be meet-
ing deadlines, ﬁ  nishing papers or cramming for exams. But what is the point when society has such a disdain for my skin color? Meanwhile, I see my white friends have the privilege of debating which cover of Frozen’s “Let It Go” is the best. And the disconcerting thing is that as the buzz surrounding Mike Brown and Eric Garner dies down, I will still live with debating whether to run in public while wearing a hoodie or walk into a store with a hat on.
I am afraid that even after Americans saw the videotape 
of Eric Garner being choked to death, many supposedly freedom-loving Americans will turn a blind eye to the issue of systemic racism, labeling it “not my problem.” This is the reality of America.
This is everyone’s problem. Failing to acknowledge, con-
demn or take direct action is the same as consent.

We’re in the home stretch, you guys. Despite the fact Flor-
ida has made a typical 180 in terms of the non-December type 
weather, there are only a few more days left of classes. Now here’s the game plan: Budget yourselves more Starbucks money than usual and crush those ﬁ  nals!
Darts & Laurels
This past week, Americans around the country celebrat-ed Thanksgiving, a time for appreciating everything we have to be thankful for. As an extension of the holiday 
spirit, many people around the country participated in “Giv-ing Tuesday” events this week, during which they donated 
their time and money to meaningful and worthy causes. Un-
fortunately, it appears that Florida is lagging severely behind other states in both charitable giving and volunteerism. Ac-cording to personal ﬁ  nance site WalletHub, Florida ranked No. 42 for overall charitability and just No. 47 in volunteer-ism. Hopefully, over the next year, Floridians will spend more time giving back to their communities with both their time and their money. For now, we’re giving a we-can-deﬁ  nitely-
do-better DART to The Sunshine State.
Floridians could probably learn a thing or two from Al-
taf Chaus, the franchise owner of Burger King in San Jose, California. Last week, Chaus found a backpack containing $100,000 that had been left in his restaurant. He immediately called police to ask for help in ﬁ  nding the backpack’s owner. When police told him that he might be eligible to keep the money if the backpack went unclaimed for six months, Chaus said he plans to donate the $100,000 to charity if the rightful owner is not found. “God has given me a good life, and I’m 
happy with that,” he said in an interview. “I think you should 
do the right thing.” A doing-the-right-thing-isn’t-always-
easy LAUREL to Altaf Chaus.
Every potential threat of a school shooting obviously de-
serves to be taken very seriously. Given the recent tragic events at Florida State University, a series of social media posts that appeared to threaten shootings here at UF caused signiﬁ  cant fear and concern within the UF community. According to University Police: “The messages were received from 15 sepa-
rate account holders from throughout the United States and 
all arrived at the same time. The threat was not speciﬁ  c but indicated ‘Im (sic) gonna shoot up the college tomorrow.’” Fortunately, it appears these social media posts were simply hoaxes. UPD says they are aware of at least one other similar shooting threat at another school that was ultimately found to be false. Regardless of the posts’ legitimacy, they certainly brought the fear of such a tragic event even closer to home. A not-real-doesn’t-mean-not-scary DART goes to the social 
media shooting threats.
In the aftermath of the events in Ferguson, Missouri, the 
media have been dominated by images of rioters and loot-ers that have resulted in an unfairly negative portrayal of the protestors as a whole. In Portland, Oregon, a 12-year-old Af-rican-American child named Devonte Hart may have helped change the way those protesting the Ferguson grand jury ver-dict are perceived. A picture of Hart tearfully embracing a police ofﬁ  cer at a protest was published by The Oregonian 
and quickly went viral. The image represents the harmony 
between different groups — whites and blacks, civilians and police ofﬁ  cers — that we as a society should strive for. A changing-people’s-minds-with-love LAUREL to Devonte

Move Hare Krishna lunch to a pedestrian-
friendly area
It’s a tale as old as time in The Gator Na-
tion. The ﬁ  erce dichotomy between bicyclists 
and pedestrians has been going strong as long as I can remember. There has been a constant struggle over who truly controls the pavement 
and where each party should dominate.
Bicycle lanes and paths are clearly delineat-
ed with friendly markings on the pavement. I 
am certain we have all seen the white, head-less ﬁ  gures on bicycles painted on the ground. These serve as well-deﬁ  ned indicators of who controls that turf. The markings are not meant to exclude pedestrians, but rather to create a safe connector so bicyclists can seamlessly maneuver through campus without inhibiting 
pedestrian trafﬁ  c.
Lately, I have been disgruntled by the bla-
tant disregard for transportation planning 
at UF. Each day, the Hare Krishna organiza-tion serves what has become a popular lunch choice among students, faculty and staff. This large luncheon used to take place on the east side of the Plaza of the Americas, away from heavy bicycle trafﬁ  c. This year, the entire af-fair has moved and is now partially occupy-ing the historically designated bicycle lane that connects Newell Road to University Av-enue on the west side of Library West. During 
lunchtime, which is the busiest time of day on 
campus, Hare Krishna lovers crowd this area, often blocking bicycles and slowing the natu-ral ﬂ  ow of bicycles trafﬁ  c.
Bicyclists and pedestrians should be in a 
symbiotic relationship, especially since we both share a common enemy: the automobile. If the Hare Krishna organization and its fol-lowing continue to crowd this area, the poten-tial for serious injury will continue to increase. Since the bike lane has long been in existence and experiences heavy trafﬁ  c, a simple remedy would be to relocate the Hare Krishna lunch 
to a more pedestrian-friendly zone. There is a 
number of green spaces dispersed throughout this beautiful campus that would be more ap-propriate for this type of gathering. It is time for bicyclists to take back what is rightfully theirs.

Letters to the Editor
A few weeks ago, I got an email ask-
ing for advice on how to practice safe BDSM sex.
I was tickled by the email, but I must ad-
mit — I know slim to none about the BDSM 
community, aside from that it stands for 
bondage and discipline, sadism and mas-ochism. So, I did what I always do and turned to the Internet for some answers.
Several blogs, some porn videos and 
one ruined browser history later, I wasn’t satisﬁ  ed. I get why the guy asked me for advice — there’s a lot of in-formation out there to sift through. It’s intimidating and hard to tell what’s really important.
So, I texted a friend, “Hey, some guy wants BDSM 
advice, so we have to do that.” He seemed enthusiastic — which is important! — so we went from there.
If BDSM is something both you and your partner 
are comfortable trying, great. BDSM can refer to a lot of things, though, so it’s important to be on the same page. Talk about exactly what you want to do. Do you want to drip hot wax on your partner’s chest? Do you want to be tied up to the bed? Do you want to be spanked with a 
paddle or whipped?
If you come up with a lot of things you want to try, 
pick just one to start out with if you’re new to BDSM. 
Once you decide on what you actually want to do, set boundaries. When I arranged my own rendezvous, we decided that neither of us were comfortable with more hardcore, painful scenes, but we did want to try bond-age.
From there, my partner and I talked about what 
would make us uncomfortable. He said that he didn’t want to be tied up and that, while he was OK with, say, my wrists being tied together, he didn’t want me tied down to an object. I agreed, but past that, I’ll leave the rest of our adventure to your imagination.
Here’s the deal: I’m not a BDSM expert. I dipped my 
toes in the water and I had a good time, but the best way to get information about any subject is to go straight to the source.
So here’s my real advice: Get involved 
with an actual BDSM community. You’ll learn more about safety and what to expect by talking to people who have BDSM sex 
regularly. This could mean reading blogs 
online, participating in forums — a post on the FetLife.com Gainesville commu-nity group suggested the site’s “Trinity” group — or meeting up with like-minded 
people. 
In the meantime, here are some extra tips I did ﬁ  nd 
helpful from my Internet exploration. Try It Comic sug-gests using plain old English — “The ropes are making 
my wrists go numb, can you loosen them?” — rather 
than a safe word. This won’t completely stop or derail the action, but it will tell your partner exactly what they should do to make you more comfortable. This might not apply to every scene, though, so make sure to dis-cuss it with your partner. 
Safety is also of utmost importance. According to 
BDSM professionals Lady Green and Jay Wiseman, you should be able to get your partner out of their restraints 
in one minute. Make sure you know how to properly 
and safely bind a person to still allow for, you know, breathing. Also, it doesn’t hurt to keep a ﬁ  rst-aid kit and some scissors nearby. If something goes wrong, it’s good to have a way to cut rope or free your partner quickly. 
Additionally, you should check in during the scene 
— “Are you still doing OK?” — as well as after — “I had a lot of fun, what did you think?” This allows you to discuss how you felt about the action and gives room to 
suggest something new or address some problems — “I 
liked it when you spanked me with the paddle, but next time, maybe not so hard?”
Ultimately, as long as your sexual acts are between 
consenting adults, done safely and don’t cause anyone discomfort, go for it! Just like with sexuality as a whole, communication is the dominant — and submissive — force behind it.Boundaries, communication key to BDSMColumn

No one ever says, 
“Wow. That’s just 
those Generation X 
kids,” or, “She is such a baby 
boomer!” In contrast, each member of today’s younger 
generation is categorized as 
being just another millennial in a spoiled and dumb youth population.
Although all generations 
are compared to the genera-tion before them, no other gen-eration has ever been placed 
under such scrutiny.
Millennials have been so 
harshly criticized that Fox 
News hosts argue that mem-bers of our generation, espe-
cially women, lack the judg-
ment to vote properly. They say we should just go back to Tinder and leave the impor-tant, worldly business to the 
real adults.
Marketing ploys target-
ed our demographic center around sex, social media and 
the next iPhone update. We 
are thought to have no more 
depth than a Starbucks mo-cha latte and a series of Tinder 
hookups.
Yes, our generation is dif-
ferent from the rest. Just like 
Generation X is different from the baby boomers and the baby boomers are different 
from the Silent Generation, 
and Generation Z will differ from us. These changes are largely the result of social evo-
lution and rapidly developing 
technology.
The millennial anthem is 
thought to be “Turn Down for What” because we lack a 
sense of intellectual depth and 
dedication to hard work.
I ﬁ  nd our generation any-
thing but lazy and unmoti-
vated. We are the most well-
informed generation. We are the most environmentally aware generation. We are the 
most creative generation.
Yes, maybe we haven’t 
seen a world war, but that 
doesn’t mean we haven’t seen terrorism and that we don’t have to worry about the threat 
of a future nuclear war.
We haven’t invented  the 
radio, the telephone, televi-
sion or Disney World. But 
we have helped pioneer the 
smartphone, found ways to cut down carbon emissions, produced great movies and books and advancements in 
globalization.
We have the weight of 
thousands of mistakes made 
by past generations squash-
ing our shoulders and heads. 
We’re making mistakes, too. But who doesn’t?
We could run away from 
the major issues of our time: global warming, ﬁ  nancial cri-ses, terrorists, civil injustice and citizen surveillance, to name a few, but we haven’t.
On the whole, millennials 
maintain a bit of an idealistic view that we can still change the world. Isn’t that grand? Against all odds, we still keep 
our hope.
So, why the watchful eyes 
and mindless name-gaming 
directed toward our genera-
tion?
We may never know.
If “Turn Down for What” 
is what will deﬁ  ne our gen-eration in the history books 
to come, so be it. No negative 
connotations will be held in my mind.
I reject the notion that mil-
lennials will “turn down” in 
the face of adversity. We’re 
plugged into technology and the media, we’re shaping it more than ever before, and 
many of us are using it to help 
make the world a better place.
Turning up for equality 
and social justice might sound 
crazy, but maybe it’s so crazy, 
it just might work.

Mixed martial arts fans can do 
more than just watch Saturday’s 
Ultimate Fighting Championship 
matches at Mother’s Pub and 
Grill — they can play it. 
EA Sports will showcase its 
UFC fighting game at the pub, lo-
cated at 1017 W. University Ave., 
at 10 p.m.
Customers can play it on the 
PlayStation 4 against each other before watching the UFC 181 event.
EA Sports will raffle off priz-
es, like versions of the game for 
both PS4 and Xbox One, along 
with company T-shirts, said the company’s college-representa-tive program manager, Summer 
Bradley.
“We come out, bring the game 
and hook them up with prizes 
and T-shirts,” Bradley said. “It’s just a lot of fun.”
Gainesville is the last stop on EA Sports’ UFC College Tour, 
which included 29 other college 
campuses and began after the game was released in June. 
“We love Florida,” Bradley 
said. “We really go after schools with the best sports programs.”
EA Sports did not pay the res-taurant to host the event, Bradley 
said.
She said Mother’s is excited 
because EA Sports has been in-
forming people about the pub airing the fight. 
Zach Dauth, a part-time bar 
manager at Mother’s, said he looks forward to the event be-cause EA Sports creates a friendly 
and inviting environment. 
“Those guys are great,” he 
said. “Of course we’re excited.”
Anthony Saavedra, the com-
pany’s UF representative, said he expects about 100 people to 
see the matches and attend the event.
“A lot of people go to bars 
with friends to watch a fight or a game, but they don’t expect a console to be there,” the 22-year-old said. “It’s very engaging.”
Saavedra, a UF industrial en-
gineering senior, said Saturday’s event will be the third one he has worked for the company as 
a representative this semester. 
Saavedra anticipates that about 50 people will actually play the game this weekend.
“Our sole purpose is to just 
get people to try out the game,” he said.Mother’s Pub to host UFC video game event this Saturday

The colorful murals on the  34th Street Wall 
will be painted black in solidarity with Fergu-
son this Sunday.
Gainesville is Ferguson, a student-organized 
mural project, will take place at 1 p.m., and its organizer, James Predelus, said the event has one goal: to challenge young adults to move 
away from social media and get their hands 
dirty. 
“Instead of people balling up their fists with 
a rock, they can ball it up with a brush, thus channeling their frustrations in a meaningful 
way,” the UF marketing junior said.
Predelus, 21, hopes to paint 90 percent 
of the wall black and stencil messages, such 
as “Gainesville is Ferguson” and “Michael 
Brown” with white paint. The event will also 
address a Staten Island grand jury’s decision to not indict a white New York police officer for the death of Eric Garner, who died during the officer’s chokehold as he was being arrested for 
allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes.
To make the project more interactive, Pre-
delus is also including the phrase “All Lives 
Matter” in hopes that volunteers will add their 
names to justify the statement.
“The idea came about when I noticed a lot of 
my fellow leaders hashtagging and comment-
ing on social media about the verdict to not indict Darren Wilson,“ Predelus said, “mean-
while not being proactive with their minds and bodies to construct a solution or build aware-ness.”
Predelus said he is using social media to find 
volunteers and to fund mural supplies, which 
he said could cost about $300.
“I think people are excited that the mural 
is happening,” Predelus said. “I believe I gave them a creative alternative to a peaceful pro-test. I have received a great deal of constructive feedback and donations as a result.”
Predelus said he recognizes that not every-
one will agree with the mural and respects their opinions and beliefs. But the event is still ex-
pected to generate about 50 volunteers from 
both the Gainesville and campus community.
The mural will allow residents to respond 
to the events in Ferguson peacefully and pro-
actively, said Veleashia Smith, director of the 
Institute of Black Culture.
“The Ferguson decision was a major blow to 
the black community, and everybody wants to find some type of way to help and to feel as 
if they are making a difference,” Smith said. 
“This mural is a response to showing solidarity to the community in Ferguson and that we will not tolerate injustice.”34th Street Wall to be painted

CLEVELAND — The U.S. Justice 
Department and Cleveland reached 
an agreement Thursday to overhaul the city’s police department after federal investigators concluded that 
officers use excessive and unneces-
sary force far too often and have en-dangered the public and their fellow officers with their recklessness.
The Justice Department found a systemic pattern of reckless and in-appropriate use of force by officers 
and cited concerns about search-
and-seizure practices. It also said officers frequently violated people’s civil rights because of faulty tactics, inadequate training and a lack of su-pervision and accountability.
Officers’ excessive use of force 
has created deep mistrust in Cleve-land, especially in the black commu-
nity, the report concluded.
“We saw too many incidents 
in which officers accidentally shot 
someone either because they fired their guns accidentally or because they shot the wrong person,” the report said.
The federal investigation was 
prompted by several highly publi-cized police encounters, chiefly the deaths of two unarmed people who were fatally wounded when police officers fired 137 shots into their car at the end of a high-speed pursuit in November 2012.
City of Cleveland Mayor Frank 
Jackson was among those who asked the department to conduct the inquiry.
Last week, hundreds of people 
blocked a Cleveland freeway at rush hour to protest those killings and the fatal shooting of a black 12-year-old 
boy named Tamir Rice by a white 
officer outside a Cleveland recre-ation center.
Police said the officer thought 
the boy was holding a firearm, but he actually had an airsoft gun that shoots nonlethal plastic pellets.
The Justice Department has 
opened civil rights investigations 
into the practices of some 20 police 
departments in the past five years, and it is reviewing both the Fer-guson police department and the chokehold death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man in New York City.
It’s also currently enforcing more 
than a dozen agreements to over-haul police department practices nationwide.
“We have seen in city after city 
where we have engaged that mean-ingful change is possible,” Holder said.
Cleveland and the Justice De-
partment will begin negotiating an agreement that will be submitted to a federal judge outlining the scope of reforms, to include the appoint-ment of an independent monitor.

While UF students are gradu-
ating on time, a new study found 
that college students around the 
country are not.
In public universities across 
the U.S., only 19 percent of stu-
dents are completing their de-
grees within four years, according 
to the Complete College America report.
At UF, the majority of fresh-
men who started school in 2009 
— 65.7 percent — graduated on 
time.These numbers have increased 
over time. In 1991, 28.9 percent completed their degrees within four years, according the UF Of-ﬁ  ce of Institutional Planning and Research.
The issue of not graduating on 
time occurs when students are unhappy with their grades,  un-able to register for classes or drop 
classes for medical reasons, said 
UF linguistics professor Stefanie Wulff.
Wulff said the more special-
ized the class is, the lower the 
drop rate is.
“When teaching an intro class, a lot of students end up dropping the class because they realize that 
the major is not really for them,” Wulff said. “However, in my sec-ond-language acquisition class, my drop rate is zero because at 
that point, the students already 
know what they want out of their degree.”
David Frick, a UF economics 
junior, said he plans to graduate on time.
“I had to drop MAC2312 for 
medical reasons, but it didn’t set me back when it came to ﬁ  nish-
ing up my degree in four years,” 
Frick, 20, said.FRIDAY, DECEMBER 5, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

TALLAHASSEE  — In the 
chaotic moments after gunﬁ  re 
erupted at Florida State Uni-
versity late last month, one fe-
male student in a library stair-well told a police dispatcher by phone, “There’s a shooter, 
please I’m begging you,” and 
another caller said, “Every-one’s running.”
The Leon County Sheriff’s 
Ofﬁ  ce on Thursday released 
more than a dozen 911 calls 
made shortly after midnight  Nov. 20 when an FSU gradu-ate armed with a gun headed 
toward the main school li-
brary and began shooting.
Three people were shot 
just outside and inside the entrance of Strozier Library in 
the middle of FSU’s campus, a 
mile west of the state Capitol. Ofﬁ  cers who arrived within two minutes of the ﬁ  rst call 
shot and killed the gunman, 
31-year-old Myron May.
Many of the calls came 
from students who either ﬂ  ed the scene right after they 
heard the shots or had barri-
caded themselves inside the stairwells, bathrooms and study rooms of the library. 
Some said they were unsure 
whether to stay put or try to ﬁ  nd an exit.
In one recorded call, a 
dispatcher repeatedly asked “Hello?” while an apparently 
discarded cellphone captured 
the noise of alarms and warn-ings going off in the back-ground.
A male FSU student told 
the operator he had been outside the library and saw a man shooting someone before turning in his direction and 
pointing his gun at him.
“I heard one gun shot, I 
turned around and he was 
sprinting at the other guy and took two more shots and 
that’s when I turned and ran,” 
the caller said.
Although authorities ini-
tially estimated that a few 
hundred students were study-
ing late at night for upcoming exams, an FSU ofﬁ  cial later told the school’s trustees that as many as 1,000 students may 
have been inside the multisto-
ry building at the time of the shootings.
May, a 2005 FSU graduate 
and an attorney, reloaded at least once and tried to enter the library, but was blocked by lobby security barriers that permit only students and staff 
inside. Police ﬁ  red off bullets 
that killed him. 
One female caller de-
scribed seeing someone on 
the ﬂ  oor and said the person 
had been shot.
“I can’t really tell what’s 
going on,” she tells the 911 dispatcher. “I don’t think the 
person is still here with the 
gun. I’m not sure, I can’t see anything.”911 calls reveal

UF lands two on All-Region ﬁ  rst team
The NSCAA named sophomore forward Savannah 
Jordan and junior defender Christen Westphal to the All-South Region ﬁ  rst team on Wednesday. 
Marcus Mariota and 
Oregon play in the Pac-12 title game with playoff hopes looming. Read the story on Page 16.ERICA A. HERNANDEZ
Alligator Staff Writer @EricaAlyssa
UF coach Billy Donovan said he has no 
good memories at Allen Fieldhouse — the 
infamous home court of No. 11 Kansas.
The last time Donovan visited Kansas 
was during his ﬁ  rst coaching job, as an as-
sistant at Kentucky in 1989. On Dec. 9, 1989, then No. 2 Kansas de-
feated Kentucky by 55 points — a statistic 
Donovan remembered off the top of his head as he recounted the memory.
Now, Donovan leads the Gators to Allen 
Fieldhouse for the ﬁ  rst time in his tenure at Florida as the unranked Gators (3-3) take on the Jayhawks (5-1) tonight at 9.
“It’s great. I think when you go and play on the road against high-level teams, you’re always going to play in a great environ-ment,” Donovan said. “And certainly they have a great environment.”
Since Donovan began coaching the 
Gators, UF has lost just one of three meet-ings.
Though sophomore point guard Kasey 
Hill has never competed at Allen Field-
house, he said he’s “heard it’s crazy.” Hill 
learned this from one of his good friends and former Jayhawk, Joel Embiid. The cur-rent Philadelphia 76ers’ center warned Hill of Kansas’ homecourt when the two talked on FaceTime on Tuesday night.
“Just talking about our season and their 
season, pretty much,” Hill said. “I mean, we both are losing right now, but it was just out of jokes, honestly. But yeah, just talking about how’s he doing, how’s his foot doing, seeing when he’s gonna play again, stuff like 
that.”
Though Eli Carter and Dorian Finney-
Smith returned to the court in the ﬁ  rst game 
of the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament against Georgetown, that might not be the case to-night for Carter. 
Donovan said on Wednesday that Carter 
has not practiced since returning from the Bahamas and will not play against Kansas.
In Florida’s 66-65 overtime loss against 
Georgetown, Carter shot 2 of 14 from the ﬁ  eld and 1 of 6 three-point shots — contrib-uting just six points in 33 minutes played.
“I’ve met with Eli, I’ve talked to him and 
he does not feel right now with his foot that he can get through a practice and if you can’t get through a practice, it’s awful hard to play,” Donovan said.
But Finney-Smith seems to have transi-
tioned back into a more permanent role on Florida’s starting lineup. 
He played a total of 84 minutes in all 
three of Florida’s games in the Bahamas and is a projected starter for tonight’s game. 
But he may not fully be healed from the 
hairline fracture in his non-shooting left hand.
Donovan said Finney-Smith missed prac-
tice on Monday because of swelling and soreness forcing him to sit out practice again on Tuesday. 
However, Donovan expected Finney-
Smith to participate in practice on Wednes-day.
“He’s got no leg issues, he’s got no wind 
issues, he’s got nothing it’s just his hand 
but sometimes that constant pounding, it’s 
something that he’s gotta deal with,” Don-ovan said. “And listen he’s been a highly competitive kid and wanting to be out there playing and part of my heart goes out for him because he’s not healthy, he is playing with two broken bones in his hand and it’s been challenging.”

Finally, the sources and ﬂ  ight tracking are over. The 
Gators have their head man. 
To me there’s nothing particularly earth shattering 
about the hiring process Jeremy Foley went through to 
get Jim McElwain. 
It seems he took the band out to Fort Collins, Colorado, 
with the idea that the whole deal would be resolved fairly 
quickly and he’d be returning home with his guy Tuesday 
or Wednesday. That didn’t happen, so Foley came home and the college football universe waited the agonizingly long time period of little more than 12 hours for word that the 
deed was ofﬁ  cially done.
We don’t have a sarcasm font 
in this newspaper, but if we did, 
the last sentence would have been in bold face 36 point. It’s 
partially my fault, I know, be-
cause I cover the team. I have a 
Twitter account that you probably follow and we live in a 24/7 news cycle but everything seemed like business as 
usual. What struck me as rather mundane became very sensationalized, but that’s the world we live in.
So what did we learn about the negotiation process 
from all the access and as heavily as it was covered? For 
me, not much of anything. 
That’s not to say there isn’t merit to covering it like 
it was, but let’s just take stock of what happened. Foley got on a plane with his people to negotiate. The negotia-
tions met an impasse, one that many of us assumed would 
come to thanks to the albatross buyout McElwain agreed to. They got over it and everyone moved on.
Florida got its payout number down to a $3 million Foley’s approach to hiring McElwain isn’t surprisingThe Gators are 3-3, unranked

they build a championship pro-
gram both on and off the ﬁ  eld.”
UF was able to work around the 
buyout snag by compensating CSU with a future game and getting 
McElwain to contribute money as 
well in a package that totals $7 mil-lion. 
UF will pay $3 million over six 
years to Colorado State, and McEl-wain will pay $2 million “over time.” 
The Gators will also play 
the Rams in a future game in 
Gainesville between 2017-20 with a 
$2 million guarantee. 
Foley — along with at least three 
additional members of the Univer-sity Athletic Association — trav-eled to Fort Collins, Colorado, via a chartered jet on Tuesday afternoon and stayed the night in order to ne-gotiate a deal with McElwain.
The plane left Colorado en route 
for Gainesville Regional Airport at 12:52 p.m. Mountain Standard Time (2:52 p.m. Eastern Standard Time) on Wednesday, which was about an hour earlier than the scheduled departure.
McElwain was not on board 
when the ﬂ  ight landed in Gainesville around 5:30 p.m.
After arriving back in 
Gainesville, Foley said conversa-tions were positive and would con-tinue.
“We had a great conversation,” 
Foley said Wednesday. “We’re not there yet.”
But they are there now.And McElwain is ready to come 
to Gainesville.
“I’m humbled, yet very excited 
about the tremendous opportunity that Dr. (Bernie) Machen and Jer-emy Foley have afforded me and my family,” McElwain said in a release. “I can’t tell you how eager 
I am to get to Gainesville to set a 
course for who we are going to be and what we will be all about.”
***McElwain turned the Colorado 
State football program around since taking the head coaching job in 2012.
The 52-year-old from Missoula, 
Montana, accrued a 22-16 career record in three seasons with the Rams, which was his ﬁ  rst head coaching job.
After taking over a team that 
boasted a 3-9 record for three straight seasons, McElwain has led Colorado State to season records of 4-8, 8-6 and now 10-2.
This season, the Rams have 
the 13th-ranked offense in yards per game (497.8) and are fourth in yards per play (7.2).
Garrett Grayson, CSU’s start-
ing quarterback and the Mountain West Conference Offensive Player of the Year, is second nationally in passing efﬁ  ciency (171.26) and 
sixth in passing yards per game 
(314.9).
Rams sophomore Rashard Hig-
gins — a ﬁ  nalist for the Biletnikoff Award, given annually to the na-tion’s best collegiate wide receiver — leads the country with 149.1 re-ceiving yards per game and 17 to-tal receiving touchdowns.
On Nov. 9, Colorado State 
checked in to the Associated Press top 25 poll at No. 23, marking the ﬁ  rst time the Rams were ranked since the week of Aug. 24, 2003.
And McElwain has an exten-
sive coaching background as well, including experience inside the Southeastern Conference.
He came from the Nick Saban coaching tree, serving as the offen-sive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Alabama from 2008-11.
The Crimson Tide went 48-6 
while McElwain was on staff and he developed two quarterbacks 
(Greg McElroy and AJ McCarron), 
a Heisman trophy winner (running back Mark Ingram in 2009) and a Heisman ﬁ  nalist (running back Trent Richardson in 2011) during his tenure.
McElwain was a part of staffs 
that won national championships with the Crimson Tide in 2009 and 
2011. 
During those four years, the 
Crimson Tide never ﬁ  elded an of-
fense that was ranked worse than 64th in the country and sixth in the SEC — both of those lows came in his ﬁ  rst year with Alabama.
Prior to his time with the Crim-
son Tide, McElwain had 23 years of 
experience at the collegiate or na-
tional level, working with Fresno State (2007), the Oakland Raiders (2006), Michigan State (2003-05), Louisville (2000-02), Montana State (1995-99) and Eastern Washington (1985-94).
***McElwain’s hiring announce-
ment came just ﬁ  ve days after former UF head coach Will Mus-champ’s ﬁ  nal game with the Gators — a 24-19 loss to then-No.3 Florida State on Saturday.
Muschamp ﬁ  nished his tenure with a 28-21 record as Florida’s head coach and went 17-15 in con-ference play. Of those 17 confer-ence wins, 11 came against Ken-tucky, Tennessee and Vanderbilt, while UF had 1-3 records against 
Georgia, LSU and Florida State un-
der Muschamp’s watch.
The ﬁ  nal nail in Muschamp’s 
cofﬁ  n with the Gators came follow-ing Florida’s 23-20 overtime loss to South Carolina on Nov. 15.
It was UF’s third straight home 
loss and the sixth loss at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium in eight games dat-
ing back to the 2013 season.
The school announced Mus-
champ’s ﬁ  ring less than 24 hours 
after the loss to the Gamecocks, with Foley saying in a release that Florida football “not where the pro-gram needs to be and should be.”“We’ve had our opportunities,” 
Muschamp said following UF’s loss to FSU on Saturday. “You look at two other games (LSU and South Carolina) where we had the game in hand and had our opportunities 
to get it done and we didn’t get it 
done.”
Florida defensive coordinator 
D.J. Durkin will serve as the interim head coach for UF’s bowl game.
While Muschamp struggled to 
consistently ﬁ  nd wins on the ﬁ  eld, he was successful with developing the football team off the ﬁ  eld.
“(I’ll be remembered as) just a 
guy that did it the right way,” Mus-champ said. “I hold my head walk-ing out of here. We did things the right way. We didn’t win enough games. I was asked to clean up a program. We did that.”

wanted this deal to get done” fee. UF 
will also play CSU sometime between 2017-20, with a guaranteed fee of $2 million to be payed to the Rams.
There was fretting Wednesday 
night, but for my money all parties had come way too far to walk that thing back at that point. Everyone knew Foley wanted McElwain, and every-
one knew McElwain wanted Florida. 
Imagine McElwain then having to go see CSU boosters in the future and his former players with the elephant in 
the room being that in early December 
he was one foot out the door.
For Florida, if you missed on this 
guy it’s not exactly fantastic PR for a fanbase that’s not exactly happy with the optics of the program right now. 
To miss on its first choice and have to 
hire the second fiddle would not have been a great look, rebuffed by the little guy CSU. I don’t think that’s a Foley problem, I think that’s a fan problem, 
but it is still a problem.
But that fretting to me was prema-
ture, because everyone had just come 
too far. It seemed like things needed 
to be negotiated, so the negotiators 
went back to the table and negotiated and boom, deal.
“Well why didn’t Florida pay the 
buyout Tuesday, they could afford 
it,” let me ask you something: you can 
probably afford to give someone $40, but does that mean you’ll do that if you think you can get the same service 
for $20? That doesn’t make any sense. 
In the end, they did work around it and they aren’t on the hook for the full $7.5 million, they’ll pay the lesser amount and they aren’t paying it in a 
lump sum either.
I’m sorry Jeremy Foley made you 
wait, I apologize for the inconve-
nience. But he, McElwain’s camp and CSU had jobs to do in this thing, and 
they did them. That takes time, and in 
less than 48 hours, you got your new head coach.Foley was wise to negotiate 
buyout down even though he could have paid it outrightEDEN OTERO

Mackenzie Dagostino is look-
ing at the NCAA Tournament as 
a chance to break the mold.
A chance to beat the teams that 
beat Florida during its preconfer-ence schedule.
A chance to make up for all 
of its early exits from the tourna-ment in the past.
And most importantly, a 
chance to show the world of col-legiate volleyball that Florida is 
for real.
And for Dagostino, it all start-
ed with the final game of the reg-
ular season – a 3-2 win over then-
No. 3 Texas.
“We were going in there we 
were like, ‘You know, we have 
nothing to lose. We’re just going to play our volleyball – Gator vol-
leyball – as hard as we can,’ and 
that’s exactly what we did,” Da-gostino said. “We went in there, we said ‘We’re coming in, it’s 
going to be our court and when 
we’re done we’ll give it back to you,’ and that’s exactly what we did. We played like it was our gym, our fans, our court and 
when we were done we gave it 
back. That was a big statement for us to make coming into the tour-nament saying you know ‘we’re 
not going to back down because 
of a label...’”
The theme of the season hasn’t been to just get to the tournament but to get there as a better team. One that Florida can be confident in no matter who’s playing.
To say that any combination of 
players from Florida’s roster that steps on the court at any given time is bound to give any team a 
run for its money sounds cliche, but it’s a fact coach Mary Wise 
has preached all season.
But there’s one tandem that 
sticks out among the rest and 
that’s right-side hitter Alex Hol-
ston and Dagostino.
The duo has been known for 
their ability to set up unstoppable 
kills and have made it difficult to track plays. 
Wise has said all season that 
Dagostino is an elite level athlete, 
while Holston is a left-handed 
potential All-American that has a 
cannon for an arm.
“Well you remember, Alex is 
playing behind Mackenzie — al-
though I think sometimes that Mackenzie has eyes in the back of 
her head — ...it has to be by feel because she (Dagostino) can’t see Alex whether Alex is in the front 
row or the back row. ...Those two 
have really found a rhythm to-gether,” Wise said,
The behind-the-back sets Da-
gostino has created for Holston throughout the season has made Florida more versatile in its front court and is partly why the Gators haven’t lost since Sept. 19.
The combination plays the 
two set up have become one of Florida’s biggest weapons aside from the ever popular 6-foot-4 
freshman Rhamat Alhassan and 
they don’t even have to talk to each other. 
Dagostino said one look is all 
it takes for the two to communi-
cate, something Dagostino said is 
a major asset on a team as deep as Florida is.
“It’s kind of like a silent bond,” 
Dagostino said. “Alex is, she’s a quieter person, but when she’s on the court it’s such a confidence builder between both of us to be able to look at each other and go, 
‘Hey, you good? I’m good, are 
you good? Yeah I’m good.’  And then that’s it and it’s just know-ing that if I start to struggle I can 
look at Alex and if Alex starts to 
struggle then she can look at me and we can just say, ‘Hey we got each other.’”FRIDAY, DECEMBER 5, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

TEAM FELL 68-58 TO SAVANNAH STATE.
GRAHAM HALL
Alligator Writer @Graham311
It appeared the Florida women’s basketball 
team had begun to correct the slow starts it has 
shown in the opening minutes of the game. 
But the Gators looked flat and hesitant 
from the beginning, and never quite recovered 
as Florida (5-2) fell to Savannah State 68-58 on 
the road Thursday night. 
Coach Amanda Butler has stressed to the 
team repeatedly over the season about the need to open the game with an uptempo pace, yet after Florida lost its first game by double digits this season, Butler repeated the prob-lems that have plagued the team over the early going.
“The way we start the game, valuing the 
possessions,” Butler said, addressing Florida’s difficulties. “Now we’re learning the hard way.”
The full court press the team has favored 
this season was unable to force turnovers, with Savannah State (4-1) consistently beating the pressure and scoring points in transition. 
Florida has relied on forcing turnovers this 
season to score quick baskets, but the Tigers committed just eight turnovers, and the Gators scored just eight points off of those turnovers. 
On the contrary, the Gators were consis-
tently sloppy, committing 25 turnovers in what was an uncharacteristically lackadaisical effort on both sides of the court. 
The Tigers made sure to capitalize on 
Florida’s mistakes, scoring 30 points off of the Gators’ carelessness with the basketball. 
Scoring a season-low 58 points, Florida got 
15 points from redshirt junior Cassie Peoples, who has been playing arguably her best bas-ketball of the season recently. 
However, Peoples had trouble maintaining 
possession of the basketball, turning the ball 
over a game-high tying six times. 
It was another low-scoring game for the 
Gators’ leading rebounder, fellow redshirt ju-
nior Carlie Needles. 
Needles consistently found herself unable 
to get free from the Tigers tough defense, being held to just five points. She didn’t score a point after halftime, although was able to move the ball well, dishing four assists opposed to just 
one turnover. 
Savannah State gave Florida multiple op-
portunities to get back into the game, but 
the Gators failed to convert on the chances at hand. The Tigers had 13 more shots than the Gators, yet Florida was able to out-rebound its opponent 45-30. 
Perhaps the lone bright spot for Florida 
was the play of redshirt senior Kayla Lewis, which has progressively improved with each 
game. Lewis had her first double-double of 
the season, scoring 12 points to go along with a season-high 10 rebounds. A staunch defender, Lewis also contributed five blocks, but the ef-fort wasn’t enough to limit a Savannah State team that scored 34 of its points in the paint. Florida loses on the road

Championship Saturday is ﬁ  nally here, and 
there is a lot on the line. Most teams in action 
this weekend are ﬁ  ghting for a spot in the Col-lege Football Playoff, while their opponents look to play the spoiler role to stop that from 
happening. Let’s break down who’s playing 
for what on Saturday, and which teams should be on upset alert. 
Pac-12 Championship Game: No. 2 Or-
egon vs No. 7 Arizona, 9 p.m. Friday, FOX
Fans get a treat the night before Champion-
ship Saturday with the Pac-12 Title game on Friday. There’s the obvious at stake — a con-
ference title and a likely playoff bid to the win-
ner, even if it is Arizona. But this game is also a rematch game, as Oregon’s only loss this season came in a 31-24 upset to the Wildcats in Eugene, Oregon. 
Arizona has quietly won 10 games and 
clinched the Pac-12 South Title after UCLA lost to Stanford last week. The Wildcats are the only team to say they’ve upset the Ducks in 
back-to-back seasons — Arizona blew Oregon 
out in last year’s regular season matchup too. If the Wildcats do it a third time, they’ll spoil Oregon’s playoff hopes, and make its own case to make it into the top four. 
Big 12 Title HuntNo. 6 Baylor vs No. 9 Kansas State: 7:45, 
ESPN: Baylor is playing for a Big 12 Title and 
a playoff bid as it faces Kansas State at home 
Saturday night. Baylor will have quarterback Bryce Petty despite him suffering concussion-like symptoms in last week’s 48-46 win over Texas Tech. A Baylor win would give the Bears a share 
of the Big 12 Title and likely put them in the top four. The TCU Horned Frogs, who are ranked ahead of the Bears at No. 3, lost to Bay-lor by three points back in October. The Big 12 Title share and a head-to-head win could give the Bears the jump over TCU in the top four. That may be easier said than done though as Kansas State’s defense is ranked 23rd in the country. 
No. 3 TCU vs Iowa State: Noon, ABC: Al-
though TCU is currently a 34 point favorite over the Iowa State Cyclones, they have to win Saturday if they want to stay in the playoff conversation. If Baylor loses to Kansas State Saturday, TCU will likely be in the playoff with a win over Iowa State. 
SEC Title Game: No. 1 Alabama vs No. 16 
Missouri- 4:00pm, CBS: The top ranked Crim-son Tide can solidify their spot in the playoff with a win in the SEC Title game on Saturday in Atlanta. Alabama is coming off of a 55-44 win over the Auburn Tigers in the Iron Bowl last week — the 55 points scored tied an Iron 
Bowl record. 
Missouri on the other hand needed two 
fourth quarter surges against Tennessee and 
Arkansas in the last two weeks to clinch a sec-ond consecutive trip to Atlanta. Quarterback Maty Mauk has improved in the last couple 
of weeks, and Mizzou’s run game led by Rus-
sell Hansbrough and Marcus Murphy played a huge role in the Tigers’ go-ahead score to put Arkansas away last week. If Missouri’s pass rush can prevent Blake Sims from throw-ing the ball effectively, the Tigers could keep 
things close. 
Big Ten Title: No. 5 Ohio State vs No. 13 
Wisconsin: 8:17pm, FOX
Ohio State looked to be a Big Ten Title lock 
and from there in the playoff conversation, 
but that was before Buckeye star quarterback J.T. Barrett suffered a season-ending leg injury against Michigan last week. With backup quar-
terback Cardale Jones, who has completed just 
11 passes in a Buckeye uniform, getting the start the Buckeyes are four point underdogs to Wisconsin. 
Badgers running back and Heisman con-
tender Melvin Gordon could have a big day matching up against the Buckeyes, but a two-loss Big Ten Champ in Wisconsin likely wouldn’t make the playoff over other one-loss 
conference champs.16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, DECEMBER 5, 2014
