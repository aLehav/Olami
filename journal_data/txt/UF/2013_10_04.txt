Jeff Driskel lines up in the shotgun.
Florida is poised to take the lead against rival 
Tennessee — a team it has beaten eight straight times — as the Gators cross midﬁ  eld into Volun-teers territory only ﬁ  ve minutes into the game.
Down.Driskel stands ready for the ball. The second-
year starter is 3 for 5 on the day. He has been facing criticism for his previous game against Miami.  
Two weeks earlier, he set a career high in 
passing yards but had three turnovers in an up-set loss to the Hurricanes. Now is the time for him to prove his worth and endear himself to the Florida faithful.
Set.Tyler Murphy looks on from the sidelines. 
The only snap of Division I football he has played was a two-point conversion attempt against Miami. It failed.
In a moment, both quarterbacks’ seasons 
are will change. One will hobble into the locker room; the other will be thrust into the spotlight.
Hike.

Murphy never should have started a game 
for Florida. That was not part of the plan.
Four years ago, when Murphy was a senior 
at Wethersﬁ  eld (Conn.) High, his future as a Di-vision I football player was uncertain. A career at Florida was not even a thought.
He played all over the ﬁ  eld and ran track. 
His legs separated him from the competition. John Campanello, Murphy’s high school coach, said he set school records in kickoff and punt returns.
“He was a dynamic runner,” Campanello 
said.
Despite his speed, Murphy never garnered 
much attention.
Rated a two-star prospect by Rivals.com, he 
was not on most schools’ radars.
“I wasn’t a highly recruited guy,” he said. Murphy did receive some scholarship of-
fers. UConn was the ﬁ  rst school to offer him a spot on the team, but it was at safety. Other programs followed. Syracuse and Temple both offered him scholarships — if he played wide receiver. 
But Murphy had no desire to switch posi-
tions.
“I wasn’t happy about it,” he said. “I played 
quarterback all my life. I wanted to continue playing quarterback.
“I thought if I changed positions I would 
have given up on myself. And I probably wouldn’t have been able to live with myself.”
Some schools did give him an opportunity 
to play where he wanted. Fordham, a Football Championship Subdivision school in New York known better for its academics than its athletics, offered him a scholarship at quarterback.
Soon after, Temple coach Al Golden offered  
Murphy a scholarship to play quarterback for the Owls.
Temple was on an upswing. Coached by 
Golden, the Owls were in the midst of a 9-4 sea-son — their best record in 30 years — and had a bid to play in the EagleBank Bowl in Wash-ington, D.C.
Murphy committed to Temple before the 
end of the 2009 season and looked to compete for a quarterback spot.
“We thought we were getting a steal,” said 
Golden, who is now Miami’s coach. 
And maybe Temple would have been getting 
a steal — a sparsely recruited prospect with real talent. Then Murphy’s highlight tape made its way to Gainesville and into the hands of Florida offensive coordinator Steve Addazio.
“He’s from Connecticut, like I am,” said 
Addazio, who is now Boston College’s coach. “I’m always excited for Connecticut guys.”The tape intrigued Addazio enough to call 
Murphy and invite him to Florida for a visit.
Although Murphy had already committed 
to play for Temple, he decided to take the 1,100-mile trip down to Gainesville.
Murphy called Golden to let him know he 
was visiting Florida. Golden encouraged him to make the trip.
“It was a tremendous opportunity for him,” 
Golden said. “I was happy for him at the time.”
On Jan. 24, 2009, Murphy decommitted from 
Temple and announced his decision to play for Florida.  
His commitment put the ﬁ  nishing touches 
on Florida’s 2010 class, which included the likes of Quinton Dunbar, Dominique Easley, Matt Elam, Sharrif Floyd and Ronald Powell. 
Murphy was far from the star of the class. He 
was not even the highest-rated quarterback of the group. That honor belonged to Venice na-tive Trey Burton.
Murphy was the nondescript cherry on top 
of a delicious sundae Florida fans could not wait to dig into.
But while other players got their chance in 
the limelight quickly, Murphy waited for his.
�    �    �
Florida’s quarterback situation was a mess 
in 2010.
Tim Tebow, arguably the best signal-caller in 
the program’s history, graduated after the 2009 season, leaving a dearth of talent in his wake.
Junior John Brantley was deemed Tebow’s 
successor but failed to ﬁ  ll the void.
In a panic, the Gators turned to a rotating 
system at quarterback. Redshirt freshman Jor-dan Reed got a chance to run the option, as did Burton. Brantley performed traditional quarter-back duties when their running attempts failed.
The three quarterbacks combined for a 60.4 
completion percentage and 12 touchdowns. To-gether, they threw 12 interceptions.
Murphy never got a chance.“It was tough,” he said. “Sitting on the side-
lines is never fun.”
While Murphy redshirted his freshman sea-
son, Brantley solidiﬁ  ed his grasp on the starting spot. In 2011, Burton and Reed moved to dif-ferent positions — running back and tight end, respectively.
Murphy’s ﬁ  rst offseason with the Gators was 
as tumultuous as the 8-5 season. 
Addazio and coach Urban Meyer both left 
the program after the 2010 season. Meyer be-came an analyst for ESPN — he is now the head coach at Ohio State; ironically, Addazio took the head coaching spot Golden vacated at Temple.
Florida brought in Texas defensive coordina-
tor Will Muschamp as the new head coach and Charlie Weis as the new offensive coordinator.
With no chance to play in sight and a new 
staff taking over, Murphy thought about fol-lowing Addazio to Philadelphia, where he orig-inally planned to play.
“It was deﬁ  nitely something I considered,” 
he said. “But I had a lot of friends here.”
Murphy was rewarded for sticking it out by 
being passed on the depth chart again. Florida brought in Jeff Driskel and Jacoby Brissett — the No. 1 and No. 3 high school quarterbacks in the nation.  
“Sometimes you have to be patient when you 
come to a big football school like this,” Murphy said. “They always bring in the best guys in the country.”
The two freshmen leapfrogged Murphy 
and got their ﬁ  rst college snaps when Brantley suffered an ankle injury. Murphy led the scout team.
“He never complained to me,” Campanello 
said. 
Even in 2012, as Murphy entered his third 
season at Florida, he was overshadowed by younger players.
Brissett and Driskel battled throughout 
training camp to replace Brantley; Murphy was never mentioned.
“It was always in the back of mind that I 
might never play,” Murphy said. “I just kept working hard and just keep ﬁ  ghting and kept faith in myself and kept praying for my oppor-tunity.”
Driskel won the job and started all but one 
game in 2012. When he suffered an injury and did not play against Jacksonville State, Brissett took the snaps at quarterback.
After the season, Brissett transferred to N.C. 
State, opening a hole in Florida’s depth chart.
Murphy ﬁ  nally had a chance to move up, 
but it still looked like he would not get a chance to play. Driskel was entrenched as the starter af-ter leading Florida to an 11-2 season and a Sugar Bowl appearance. 
A brief opportunity ﬂ  uttered before Mur-
phy’s eyes in August. Driskel underwent an ap-pendectomy and missed the ﬁ  rst week of train-ing camp.For a week, Murphy was the starter. For a 
week, he got to enjoy what being the No. 1 quar-terback at Florida was like. But it did not last. Driskel recovered from the surgery and quickly took his place atop the depth chart.
“When he started fall camp … he hit the line, 
he was running,” offensive coordinator Brent Pease said. “You wouldn’t know where he was on the depth chart.”
Said Murphy: “I’ve always tried to prepare 
myself as if I was the starter. I try to take every rep as if it’s a game rep.”
But with Driskel back in action, Murphy ex-
pected to sit on the bench. 
“There have been times where I felt like giv-
ing up,” Murphy said. “The coaches, they’ll come up to me and say, ‘You’re looking good, keep working, you never know when your chance is going to come.’”
When Driskel suffered a season-ending frac-
tured ﬁ  bula during the ﬁ  rst quarter against Ten-nessee on Sept. 21, Murphy got that chance.
�    �    �
Two weeks into his playing career, Murphy 
is the most popular name on campus. But he is still unrecognizable to most Florida fans.
“A few people come up to me and tell me 
good game,” he said, “but those are just a few people I’ve had class with or something.”
Through two games, he’s thrown for 290 
yards and two touchdowns. He has completed 71.9 percent of his passes.
“He hung in there,” Campanello said. “He’s 
making the most of his chance.”
It has not all been roses for Murphy. He took 
a snap to the face mask against Tennessee that made its rounds on Twitter before Murphy even got off the ﬁ  eld.
But otherwise, the transition has been smooth. 
Teammates said Murphy has been a calming presence in practice and during games. 
The redshirt junior has proven hard to rattle, 
showing a conﬁ  dence and demeanor usually re-served for longtime starters.
“He’s extremely intelligent,” Muschamp 
said. “He doesn’t get caught in the moment, so to speak, as far as his emotions, and that’s some-thing you want at that position.”Murphy has performed better in relief of 
Driskel than anyone could have expected. But he’s trying to not let that get to him. The Gators’ hopes for the season rest on his arm, but he wants to continue doing what got him to where he is now.
“It probably didn’t hit me until that ﬁ  rst 
practice,” he said. “I kind of came out and tried to do too much ... I think it kind of hit me then that I was the guy. I realized I couldn’t change who I was.”

UF is working toward becoming a top 10 
university in the nation — but it has yet to 
make the top 100 for worldwide rankings.
Times Higher Education’s World Univer-
sity Rankings 2013-2014 came out Wednes-day and placed UF at 128 out of 400. The rankings, powered by information company Thomson Reuters, judged universities on teaching, research, industry income, cita-tions and international outlook.
UF dropped six places from the 2012-2013 
study and three from 2012-2011. The univer-sity was unranked in the 2010-2011 listing.
California Institute of Technology was 
ranked No. 1 for 2013-1014, followed by Harvard, Oxford and Stanford. University of Wyoming was last. Universities are ex-cluded if they don’t have an undergraduate program or have fewer than 1,000 research articles from the last six years.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said there 
are many ranking systems out there, each with its own methodology, and not all of them necessarily carry the same weight.
U.S. News & World Report’s 2014 list of 
the top 30 public universities in the nation, recently ranked UF at 14.

Gainesville Police arrested 
three people Wednesday morn-
ing on Interstate 75 after ﬁ  nding more than two pounds of meth in their car.
Ofﬁ  cers arrested Jesseca 
Wedekind, 34, of California, as well as Trinidad Madrigal, 42, and Guillermo Alcazar, 36, on charges of trafﬁ  cking more than 14 grams of methamphetamine and conspiracy to trafﬁ  c meth-amphetamine, according to a GPD arrest report. At about 8:15 a.m., Alcazar 
was pulled over on I-75 south of Gainesville for driving be-hind a tractor-trailer too closely, according to the report. The of-ﬁ  cer observed that Wedekind seemed nervous, and each per-son had a different story about their travel plans and relation-ships to each other.
A police dog smelled drugs 
coming from the car, according to the report. Upon searching    the car, police found 2.7 pounds of meth in the trunk under the spare tire. 
A dashboard camera video showed Alcazar telling Wede-kind and Madrigal that he was going to prison because of the  dope in the car, according to the report. He asked one of them to bail him out.  
During questioning Wede-
kind told police they’d been smoking meth during the trip out of a bag in the trunk.
Ofﬁ  cers booked Wedekind, 
Madrigal and Alcazar into jail at about 3:30 p.m. Wedekind and Madrigal remained Thurs-day night with a $600,000 bond each. Alcazar was transferred to a different facility.

Four Student Government elec-
tions violation complaints ﬁ  led this 
week were withdrawn Thursday.
Two complaints from Students 
Party and two from the Swamp Party, were dropped, said  Elections Commission Chairwoman Brianne Lewis.
Swamp Party ﬁ  led one com-
plaint Monday against Students Party candidate Michael Christ for unregistered language on a party ﬂ  ier, and a second against the party Tuesday for volunteers knocking on doors in areas where a “No Solicit-ing” sign was posted. After a group meeting, Swamp Party President Vi-van Nguyen dropped its complaints when  her party won 48 out of 50 senate seats Wednesday night.
“At this point we felt our victory 
was so great that it really spoke for itself,” she said. “We didn’t need to pursue those charges against the Students Party anymore.”
Students Party followed suit. 
Daniella Saetta, the party’s presi-dent, had ﬁ  led a complaint for un-registered photos on the Swamp Party’s Facebook page and another for the Swamp Party’s showcasing of the now-retired Unite Party’s ac-complishments.
“We just decided that we’d rath-
er focus efforts on getting the party ready for the next election, not fo-cus on pesky little arguments with Swamp Party,” she said. “It’s time to move on.”

The gameday roasted peanut sale is back by 
popular demand.
The sale, which offers 2-pound cans of pea-
nuts for $7 on weekends during football season, 
relaunches Saturday after a four-year freeze due to unreliable suppliers.
The peanuts can be purchased at McCarty 
Hall A two hours before home football games until the end of halftime and on Fridays during football season from 4 to 6 p.m. There’s also an online ordering option. Interested patrons can email agronomygrads@gmail.com.The purpose of the sale is to raise money for 
undergraduate and graduate agronomy stu-dents and is presented by the Agronomy-Soils Club and the Agronomy Graduate Student Or-ganization.
Diane Rowland, an associate agronomy pro-
fessor at UF and an adviser for the sponsoring clubs, said she received requests from alumni and game attendees asking for the sale to re-turn. Rowland said she decided to help with the sale because it’s also helping Florida’s economy, in which peanuts are a key crop. The state is one of the top producers of peanuts in the U.S., she said.
José López, 27, president of the Agronomy 
Graduate Student Organization, said the pro-ceeds from the sale will help send agronomy students to an international agricultural con-vention in Tampa in November.
“Buying the peanuts is helping the agrono-
my students (obtain) the education that they’re trying to get,” he said.UF clubs go nuts on gameday
� STATE PARK TRAFFIC IS 
EXPECTED TO INCREASE DURING THE SHUTDOWN.
REBECCA TURKEL
Alligator Contributing Writer
As the government shutdown con-
tinues to bar many agencies and servic-
es, some local residents are mourning the temporary loss of national parks.
Shutdowns have affected the nation-
al park system before, said David Fos-ter, a UF professor who teaches Geology of American National Parks.
“The parks are signiﬁ  cant for both 
of the preservation of natural history as well as the cultural history of the coun-try,” Foster said.The history within some of the na-
tional monuments and the relationship between historical and cultural aspects of early Americans are seen in areas of the parks, Foster said.
Foster said he suspects state park 
trafﬁ  c will pick up in the time that na-tional parks remain closed, as people will look for alternative places to visit.
Jenna Ingram, a 20-year-old UF 
health education junior, grew up visit-ing the Everglades.
“I used to go there during my child-
hood with my family,” Ingram said. “It was a really cool thing to be able to see all of the nature and wildlife that lives in the Everglades.”
It’s a historic part of Florida, Ingram 
said, and it’s upsetting to see it closed.All national parks closed

the agronomy students (obtain) the

A summer job working for a mov-
ing company led 24-year-old Kyle 
Cabral to create a new social network-ing website just for Greeks.
Cabral, a Zeta Beta Tau Fraternity 
alumnus, was working for UF Mover Guys when he said he realized soror-ity women were overcharged by fur-niture movers. He felt these women could save money if they had a way to connect online with fraternity men to help them move.
Cabral created GreekSociaLife.com 
to allow Greeks to connect with people based on year, major and Greek afﬁ  lia-tion. The website, which was launched in September, also has a classiﬁ  eds section.
“It’s like Craigslist; it’s like Face-
book,” Cabral said. “It’s a lot of stuff in one.”
Cabral hopes to attract advertisers 
to the website as soon as the member base is large enough. He plans to do-nate 10 percent of proﬁ  ts from those advertisers to Dance Marathon at UF.
Lauren Watson, a 22-year-old ad-
vertising senior at UF, said the dona-tion made to Dance Marathon was one of the main reasons she created a proﬁ  le. 
Watson, a member of Delta Gamma 
Sorority, said Facebook has become so broad that it is hard to connect with other Greeks.
“A lot of people in Greek life want 
to communicate about ideas, but they don’t really have a platform,” Watson said.Alum makes Craigslist- 
like Greek social site
The rankings were based on school-provided data or estimates
top institutions in the country,” Or-
lando said. “We provide an incred-ible value for the education our stu-dents receive.”
According to the Times Higher 
Education’s site, all the schools con-sented to being ranked and provided the data used. If any data is missing for “low-weighted” indicators like industrial income, a low estimate is entered. Orlando said he wasn’t sure if UF provided information or if the ranks were based on public data.Calvin Lu, an 18-year-old UF 
chemical engineering freshman, said he believes UF should be ranked higher, but feels the university could be doing more to achieve it.“I heard they’re building a new 
mansion for the president,” Lu said. “Why don’t they put that money back into the school for the stu-dents?”

In Gainesville, the show still 
goes on.
After a sold-out run of “Miss 
Witherspoon,” the latest comedy 
produced by UF’s School of The-atre + Dance, students continue to express interest in live art, con-trary to the national norm.
Attendance rates for musicals 
dropped by 9 percent since 2008,  according to a recent survey by the National Endowment of the Arts. 
Plays have been hit even hard-
er by a 12 percent drop over the same period.
Fortunately for the UF the-
ater department, even with the sold-out run, students were still scrambling to see the stage. 
Veronica Salgueiro, a 20-year-
old UF advertising and theater junior, arrived an hour and a half early Friday to squeeze onto the show’s waiting list. “Everyone should experience 
the art of live performance,” Sal-gueiro said.
Overﬂ  ow of audience mem-
bers may be the result of some students using $2 coupons to at-tend performances because of class requirements. 
Caitlyn Lower, a 20-year-old 
UF public relations junior, said she understands the widespread declining attendance rates. 
She wouldn’t spend more than 
$10 for a show she hadn’t heard good reviews about.
Than Nguyen, a 20-year-old 
UF botany junior, said she likes the theater art form. 
But she was disappointed she 
couldn’t see “Miss Witherspoon” because it was sold out. 
The show ran from Sept. 20 to 
Sept. 29.  
“Seeing live theater makes you 
more cultured and rounded,” Nguyen said. “You get emotion and expression (from watching a show).”
UF performance sells out despite national attendance trend
The next UF School 
of Theatre + Dance 
performance, “Never the Sinner,” directed by Ralf Remshardt, opens today at the UF Constans Theatre in the Nadine M. McGuire Theatre and Dance Pavilion.
Tickets are $13 for 
students and $17 for the general admission.Reader response

Whew, what a week: You voted in student elections, aced 
your midterms, fretted over the Congressional budget grid-lock and watched Rihanna school Miley Cyrus on sex appeal in her new music video for “Pour It Up.”
So relax and get comfy with this week’s edition of... 
Darts & Laurels
Our ﬁ  rst LAUREL goes to Sinead O’Connor, who wrote 
an open letter to Miley Cyrus warning her about how the mu-sic industry takes advantage of young women who rely on their sexuality to sell records.
“They will prostitute you for all you are worth, and clev-
erly make you think its what YOU wanted,” she wrote.
While the letter was schoolmarmish in some places where 
she warned Cyrus about baring too much skin, O’Connor’s intentions were pure. Talent and sexuality aren’t mutually ex-clusive, but we agree with O’Connor’s sentiment that heavy-handed sexiness can obscure talent in the music industry and media.
Next, a big, collective DART to the GOP and its hypo-
critical concern over children with cancer who were denied clinical trials by the National Institute of Health due to the government shutdown.
According to The New Yorker blogger Amy Davidson, 
“The professed anxiety by the G.O.P. about how children will be cared for doesn’t line up well with documents like the Paul Ryan budget, which translates into wholesale cuts in the Children’s Health Insurance Program and Medicaid. The American Cancer Society’s advice for the parents of un-insured children, which makes for depressing reading, talks about Medicaid and other low-income programs in terms of hope.”
Listen up, millennials: You need to unclench. Earlier this 
week, we reported on “Millennials: A Portrait of Generation Next” and quoted a professor at UF who said ours is the most stressed-out generation yet — and technology, she said, may be the culprit.
A DART, then, to millennials who can’t unplug. Put 
down your phone and go take a walk — communing with nature for a few minutes may help you calm down and quit measuring yourself against your Facebook friends.
Thursday, USA Today reported scientists are working on 
a new medication for people with clostridium difﬁ  cile, a bac-terial infection that can cause a life-threatening inﬂ  ammation of the colon. The infection can occur as a result of the victim taking antibiotics that deplete the body’s healthy microbes.
Plot twist: The new medication contains human fecal bac-
terial. Hence, its hilarious and totally juvenile nickname: the “poop pill.”
A professor of medicine told USA Today, “Just speak-
ing for myself, it would be difﬁ  cult to compete against the ready availability and very cheap acquisition costs of human poop.”
A LAUREL to the Canadian research team behind this 
amazing discovery. Science rules.
Happy Friday!
New Iranian president hasn’t delivered 
In an unsurprising and opportune moment last 
month, an Iranian ofﬁ  cial snubbed yet another U.S president. 
Hassan Rouhani, Shiite cleric and newest presiden-
tial elect, opted against shaking hands with President Barack Obama at the U.N. General Assembly. 
According to The New York Times, Obama report-
edly phoned Rouhani upon invitation with the intent to discuss Iran’s nuclear program. 
The 15-minute phone call has since been callously 
dubbed “historic” by Western media outlets, who ne-glect to acknowledge the lack of progress made by both indirect and direct dialogue. 
Instead, Rouhani refuted any claim the phone call 
was invited and, according to Reuters, claimed the call was a U.S.-led initiative. 
Reuters also reported Rouhani was greeted by egg-
wielding hardliners upon his return to the Islamic re-public and even had a shoe hurled at him. 
The Iranian president’s unwillingness to shake 
Obama’s hand and his return to a hostile Iran reinforce the understanding that the Ayatollah still exerts a full paternalistic power in Iran. 
Yet there seems to be an air of optimism surrounding 
the newly elected president. 
Indeed, the image of the Iranian reformer is quite fa-
miliar. 
In 1997, Mohammad Khatami was elected to the 
presidency with promises of reforms, according to the BBC. 
However, the dissatisﬁ  ed supreme leader stymied 
the hopeful reforms and, as a result, Khatami’s policies failed. 
Reformist leader Mir Hussein Mousavi suffered a 
similar fate in 2009 when elections were rigged against him, the Guardian reported. 
Mousavi then faced the wrath of the Ayatollah for encouraging democratic re-forms amidst the Arab Spring, a venture for which he was placed on house arrest. 
With such an appalling level 
of autonomy, it’s obvious why spectators hold Iranian presi-dents to such a low standard. 
For instance, after conduct-
ing a speech with CNN in which Rouhani allegedly afﬁ  rms and condemns the Holocaust’s existence, he received praise from those who thought him to be an anomaly. 
Yet the Iranian news agency Fars claimed the CNN 
translation was misleading and that the word “Holo-caust” was never used, according to Slate. 
This begs the question: Can the international com-
munity trust a man who refuses to shake another man’s hand? Or politely receive a phone call without denying he invited it? Or even conﬁ  rm what he said in an inter-view? 
Despite his promises of reform, Rouhani’s actions 
have shown he is not a reformist or revolutionary but quite simply another tool plucked by the Ayatollah from his garage of obtuse theologians. 
Accepting the Holocaust occurred or picking up a 
phone call doesn’t qualify as reform. 
The seventh president of the Islamic republic ﬁ  rst 
has to show his willingness to follow through on prom-ises not to pursue nuclear weapons, oversee democratic change in his country and break free of the Ayatollah’s grip. 
However taunting this may seem, the ﬁ  rst step would 
be for those outside of Iran to hold him accountable to his promises.

Violence and conﬂ  ict have 
always been fundamental in video games. As video 
games became deﬁ  ned by win and loss stats, violence and death fol-lowed suit. And just as in any other entertain-ment medium, tensions rise when the stakes are high, and what could be higher than life or death?
While more recent games have expand-
ed upon exploring deeper, more profound themes, gunplay and conﬂ  ict remain at their core. In fact, the three most critically acclaimed games released this year are games in which your interaction with the world is done mainly with your gun. “The Last of Us” attempts to explore the idea of self, family and community in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. “Grand Theft Auto V” attempts to satirize the American Dream in a world of excess and luxury. “Bio-Shock Inﬁ  nite” attempts to explore the idea of fate contrasted with American exceptionalism and political dichotomies. These themes are explored only through expository cutscenes; for the other 90 percent of the game, the virtual worlds are viewed by looking down the barrel of a gun.
Yet one of the largest controversies sur-
rounding the release of “Grand Theft Auto V” two weeks ago was based not on the mindless murder of innocent civilians or the casual vio-lence throughout the game but on a player-con-trolled torture scene during one of the missions. It’s one of the most brutal and uncomfortable segments I’ve ever played in a game. In con-trast to the use of excessive violence and gore in the rest of the medium, the violence in this scene opposes and satirizes the use of torture, even if its message isn’t entirely original.
To provide some context, almost every 
character within the universe of “Grand Theft Auto V” is an awful human being — calling the protagonists “antiheroes” would be a stretch. Playing as Trevor, the eccentric lunatic of the three protagonists, you’re forced by crooked federal agents to tor-ture the clearly innocent electri-cian of an assassination target. The torture provides little information, 
just enough to provide a vague outline of a target who most likely was innocent. But this scene makes the player confront this man beg-ging for mercy and freely choose which torture methods to use. Aside from antagonizing the federal agents you’re forced to work for in the context of the game, this scene confronts the uselessness and horrors of torture. It’s a message that has certainly been expressed in more complex ways in other media, but being placed in the role of the torturer, mixed with the game’s satirical dark humor, adds a certain weight to the game’s message. In a medium in which violence is within the norm, it’s sadden-ing that media outlets are criticizing the scene that actually is attempting to say something about violence and the horriﬁ  c acts we, as play-ers, are willing to commit.
If anything, criticism and concern should be 
directed toward games that sanitize violence, such as “Call of Duty,” which equates warfare to a sport in which killing others becomes re-duced to increasing numbers and statistics in its metagame. Even if the torture scene in “Grand Theft Auto V” is a bit excessive, this surplus of violence confronts the player with the question of how far he or she is willing to go. 
As video games grow to provide deeper, in-
trospective experiences, chastising them for de-picting graphic, disturbing scenes that attempt to make a statement only sets the medium back. If anything, we should be more disturbed by games that are willing to permit the player to evade any serious critical reﬂ  ection in order to provide a mindless, more “fun” experience.

California Berkeley’s student newspaper, The Daily Californian. This column originally appeared on UWire.
A violent look at video games UWire
We Americans are 
in a bad mood about our nation 
and our public life. Three-quarters say the country is on the wrong track. Some of us may be especially angry at the current Con-gress, at President Barack Obama — or both — but the roots of our discontent go deeper than that. 
Maybe we are angry because we 
face profound problems the govern-ment isn’t addressing — persistent un-employment, climate change, violence and mass incarceration and the slow desertion of our great industrial cities, to name just a few.
Although we should expect more 
from the government and our political leaders, they cannot solve these prob-lems on their own. People can solve even the most difﬁ  cult problems if they are organized and active. That is not a wish — it is a ﬁ  nding of extensive re-search. But where are we going to get more active and responsible citizens?
That’s where you come in; you can 
be a more effective citizen. Civic en-gagement that improves the world al-most always has three characteristics. It is deliberative: Citizens talk and listen to fellow citizens who may disagree with them. It is collaborative: Citizens actually roll up their sleeves and work together, building or saving or produc-ing goods. And it creates civic relation-ships, partnerships among people who want to improve the world together.
Many thousands of 
college students are al-ready active in these ways 
through service programs, environ-mental groups, faith communities and online communities.
If you are not yet involved, you 
should join. If you are involved, it is time to take your engagement to the next level. You should ask why so many obstacles stand in the way of ac-tive citizens.
For instance, why does our politi-
cal system cater to professionally led, well-funded interests instead of citi-zens who deliberate and collaborate? Why do schools and colleges offer so little civic education? Why is so little funding available for citizens’ groups? Why do the news and entertainment media rarely depict citizens working together to address problems?
The only people who can overcome 
these obstacles are the citizens who are already active at the grassroots level, because they know what citizenship looks like and why we need more of it. A movement of active citizens is the only thing that can address our most serious national challenges.

University and author of the new book “We Are the Ones We Have Been Wait-ing For: The Promise of Civic Renewal in America.”

With ongoing bicycle accidents 
and a wave of tickets, University Police is urging students to abide by campus bike rules.  
So far this semester, ofﬁ  cers 
gave out more than 280 warnings and about 10 citations to cyclists disobeying rules, said UPD Capt. Jeff Holcomb. These numbers are average for Fall, he said. But last week, a woman was 
sent to the hospital with severe injuries after she was hit by a bi-cyclist while getting off a bus on Gale Lemerand Drive.
“In Florida, a bike is considered 
a vehicle, so you have to abide by the same rules,” Holcomb said.He also mentioned that riding 
a bike with headphones is illegal. 
At nighttime, cyclists should 
have one white-colored light in the front and one red-colored light in the back, he said.
Mainly, Holcomb said police 
want to remind cyclists and pe-destrians to practice common sense. For example, if a bus stops and nobody gets on, it’s likely someone from the bus will be get-ting off, so cyclists should slow down to avoid hitting someone, he said.“I guess the warning is just to 
remind bicyclists to use a little bit of judgment,” he said.
Robbie Pomeroy, a 19-year-old 
UF criminology sophomore who got grazed by a bicycle last year, said he thinks similar incidents are isolated and can be prevented by pedestrian awareness.
“As you get accustomed to be-
ing on a really bike-friendly cam-pus, you become more aware,” he said. “It’s kind of a pedestrian’s job, even though it should kind of be the other way around.”
In wake of accident, University Police asks cyclists to abide by rules

- Bicyclists must yield right-of-way to pedestrians - Bicyclists must orally signal to a pedestrian before passing - Bicyclists may not ride with earbuds- Between sunset and sunrise, bikers must display a white light on the front of the bike and a red light and reﬂ  ector on the back“I guess the warning is 
just to remind bicyclists to 
use a little bit of judgment.”

Captains announced
Will Muschamp announced via Twitter that offensive lineman Kyle 
Koehne, receiver Trey Burton, Buck linebacker Ronald Powell and safety Jabari Gorman will serve as Florida’s captains against Arkansas. Savannah Jordan and the Florida soccer team face South Carolina tonight at 7. Read the story on page 14. Golfer to lead cheer
PGA veteran Chris DiMarco will serve as the honorary “Mr. Two Bits” prior to Florida’s game against Arkansas on Saturday at 7 p.m. in The Swamp.ADAM PINCUS
Alligator Staff Writer @adamDpincus
A 67-yard run takes more than 
a running back hitting the hole. 
Matt Jones’ career-long scam-
per against Kentucky on Saturday 
took two key blocks from center Jon Harrison and left tackle D.J. Humphries.
Harrison, the anchor of Flori-
da’s offensive line, pulled around left tackle to engage linebacker Avery Williamson as Humphries chipped safety Ashely Lowery. The two linemen sprung Jones, who finished the game with 176 rushing yards during a 24-7 vic-tory.
Athletic offensive linemen are 
nothing new for No. 18 Florida, which will host the Southeastern Conference’s sacks leader in Ar-kansas at 7 p.m. on Saturday in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
“We’ve always had it in our 
scheme,” offensive coordinator Brent Pease said. “It’s just kind of sometimes with fronts, it depends who, (and) which guys are pull-ing. It’s not always him. It kind of depends on what defense they’re playing.”
Although pulling, a run-block-
ing technique, will not be used against the Arkansas pass rush, Florida’s offensive line will have to protect the edges with two of the conference’s best ends.
Razorbacks defensive ends 
Chris Smith and Trey Flowers have combined for nine sacks this season. Smith leads the conference with six, which is 1.5 sacks more than Kentucky’s Za’Darius Smith, who ranks second.
“They can win one-on-one bat-
tles. They can demand combina-tions where they single somebody else up,” Pease said. “And I think their scheme, you know, how they maneuver them and use games with them, it’s tough. We have a lot to handle with that.”Florida has experience dealing 
with standout defensive linemen. Texas A&M feasted on quarter-back Jeff Driskel, who was mak-ing his first career start during a 20-17 victory last season. Eight sacks later — including three from Damontre Moore — it appeared the Florida offensive line could not measure up.
Redshirt junior Tyler Murphy 
will face arguably his toughest test in just his second career start. 
He was sacked once against 
Kentucky. Arkansas does not only boast a potent punch coming off the edge. The Razorbacks’ starting two defensive tackles — seniors Robert Thomas and Byran Jones — are 325 and 318 pounds, re-spectively. Sophomore DeMarcus Hodge, Thomas’ backup, tips the scales at 345 pounds.
“We’ll have different protec-
tions. Whether it’s a six- or seven-man protection utilizing our tight ends and backs to chip on Smith and Flowers,” coach Will Mus-champ said. “They’re really good rushers. They have two big guys inside who do a good job of push-ing the pocket, but there’s no ques-tion we need to account for them.”
For the first time all season, 
the big boys up front are finally on the mend. Excluding starting right tackle Chaz Green, whose shoulder surgery ended his season before it started, the Gators have a relatively healthy unit.
They will need it when the Ra-
zorbacks travel to Gainesville for the first time since 2009.
“They’ve got two speed defen-
sive ends. They’re really good on the edges,” right guard Jon Hala-pio said. 
“The strength of their team is 
the front four. Their two inside guys, big, heavy guys, I think are 330-350 and their backups too. They’re very physical up front. We’re definitely in for a challenge this week.”The U.S. government may be 
shut down, but we here at the alli-

MICHELLE PROVENZANO
Alligator Writer @mmprovenzano
After a 1-0 loss to Missouri on Sun-
day, Savannah Jordan just wants to fo-
cus on the rest of the schedule.
The freshman forward took six of 
Florida’s 21 shots against Mizzou but couldn’t get the ball in the net. 
“You just have to move on,” Jordan 
said. “You have to put it behind you because there are so many more games this season.” 
Now in the midst of Southeastern 
Conference play, No. 8 Florida (8-2-1, 2-1 SEC) will look to redeem itself when it plays No. 19 South Carolina (9-1-1, 2-1 SEC) on Friday at 7 p.m. at James G. Pressly Stadium.
“South Carolina is always really 
defensively organized,” coach Becky Burleigh said. 
“They’re hard to score on because 
they don’t take a lot of risk going for-ward, but they like to counter. We have to be aware of the counter, and I think we deﬁ  nitely have to be good at exe-cuting offensively.”
The Gators face the Gamecocks ear-
lier in the season than in past years. Florida has a history of playing South Carolina close to the end of the regular season and right before the SEC Tour-nament. 
The last time the two teams met, 
Florida blanked South Carolina 3-0 on Oct. 25.
After a rocky road weekend, Bur-
leigh said the team worked on the mistakes it made during Sunday’s Mis-souri matchup.
“We have to play for 90 minutes or 
do whatever it takes,” Burleigh said. “We probably played for 70 minutes (of the Missouri game). That ﬁ  rst 20 we just were a little bit behind and not quite in rhythm. It allowed [Missouri] to get on the scoreboard and that made us have to chase the game.”
Jordan added: “After Sunday’s 
game, I think we’re really going to be focused in wanting to come out with a lot of ﬁ  re under us and come out stron-ger than before.” 
A major part of playing the full 90 
minutes is Jordan and her ability to score.
After notching Florida’s ﬁ  rst goal in 
the fourth minute against Mississippi on Sept. 27, Jordan has 11 goals this season, tying her with ﬁ  ve other play-ers for sixth in the nation.
“My preparations will exceed my 
expectations,” Jordan said of her suc-cess this season. 
“I thoroughly prepared myself com-
ing in. Coming in the spring was a step up and helped me to exceed for the fall now. It wasn’t planned at all, but I’m happy it’s happening. I just hope I can keep it up and help the team win.” 
Getting past the Gamecocks’ de-
fense will be critical for Jordan, while the Gators’ key to success will be mak-ing plays early and ﬁ  nding the open ar-eas when the defense targets the fresh-man phenom.
Florida concludes the weekend 
against Auburn (4-6-1, 0-3 SEC) on Sunday at 2 p.m. at James G. Pressly Stadium. The Gators beat the Tigers to win the 2012 SEC Tournament title.
“For us, it’s another chance to get 
three points,” Burleigh said of the weekend’s matchups. 
“We want to go into each SEC game 
trying to get three points, no matter how that happens.”

Now on to the picks!
In ﬁ  rst with a record of 25-12-3 is al-
ligatorSports Editor Phillip “Wait, lungs 
aren’t replaceable?” Heilman, who impul-sively decided to take up smoking during last week’s trip to Lexington. Riding in a car with Adam Pincus for hours on end re-ally took one hell of a toll on you, huh? 
Next up with a record of 24-13-3 is al-
ligatorSports football writer Joe “I’m a real journalist” Morgan, who was left at home during our trip to Kentucky. To be honest, we didn’t really miss him all that much. He’s much more pleasant when he’s drunk on his couch than when he’s breathing our air anyway.  
In third with a record of 23-14-3 is Cody 
“Pick 6” Jones, who stirred up his inner Tony Romo by failing to make two of his eight picks this week. If you’re not going to try, then why the hell bother? Also, go Dodgers!
In fourth with a record of 22-15-3 is al-
ligatorSports football writer Adam “Road-trip nightmare” Pincus, who sweat pro-fusely throughout the trip to Kentucky, had only one song on his iPod and even stepped on a poor, innocent butterﬂ  y while stumbling out of the car at a gas station. Some men just want to watch the world burn. 
Tied for fourth is alligatorSports Assis-
tant Editor Adam “L-I-C-uhh ...” Lichten-stein, who spelled his own name wrong while corresponding for the Tampa Bay Times last weekend. You get mad at us for calling you “Steve,” but you can’t even get your last name right? C’mon, man.
Sitting in ﬁ  fth with a record of 21-16-
3 is 247sports.com’s Thomas “I spent how much?” Goldkamp, who made Blue Moon his drink of choice during a recent hang-out. I though only women ordered drinks with fruit in the glass.Stunningly not in last this week with a 
record of 19-18-3 is InsidetheGators.com’s Bryan “Whip it out” Holt, who admitted to urinating on a colleague’s couch sometime in the recent past. Make sure to regularly take the little guy out if he comes over to your house to watch a Rays game. Or just lay down a few copies of this paper. What-ever works. And in dead-ass last with a piss-poor 
record of 18-19-3 is the Orlando Sentinel’s Edgar “AirTrans-vestite” Thompson, who recently recounted the “strange vibes” he and a former colleague on the Miami Dol-phins beat experienced on a ﬂ  ight headed to an NFL game during “Destiny Week” in New Orleans. Good Lord.

Scottie Wilbekin is working his 
way back into coach Billy Dono-
van’s good graces.
The senior point guard will 
rejoin the Gators when the team holds its ﬁ  rst practice on Oct. 11, UF announced Thursday via its team website. 
Suspended since June 10 for 
violating team rules, Wilbekin has been working out at UF’s basket-ball facility away from the team. 
Wilbekin will be made avail-
able to reporters at Florida’s an-nual media day on Wednesday, the school also said. 
At the Jimmy V Classic Gala 
on Wednesday, Donovan said Wilbekin would miss an undis-closed amount of games to start the season. 
“When I allow him to play, 
that is an unknown right now,” Donovan said. 
“But he’s done everything I’ve 
asked him to do through the sum-mer and now into conditioning. He’s not quite back on our team yet, but right now he’ll be back to start practice.” 
Wilbekin averaged 9.1 points 
and ﬁ  ve assists per game as a starter last season. In his likely absence, ﬁ  ve-star signee Kasey Hill will ﬁ  ll in at point guard. 
Florida kicks off its season at 
home against North Florida on Nov. 8 and then will travel to Madison, Wis., to face Wisconsin four days later.  
Yeguete, Carter not ready: Se-
nior forward Will Yeguete (right knee) and Rutgers transfer guard Eli Carter (fractured right ﬁ  bula) will not be cleared to participate in Florida’s ﬁ  rst practice, Dono-van conﬁ  rmed Wednesday. 
Yeguete underwent ar-
throscopic debridement on his right knee in May to repair carti-lage. His initial projected recov-ery time was about four months. 
Donovan said Yeguete is “still 
in the process of rehabbing.”
Carter suffered his season-
ending injury in Rutgers’ game against DePaul on Feb. 16. 
“It’s going to be a process,” 
Donovan said of Carter in a re-lease. 
“Right now, he’s way, way be-
hind. He’s behind in terms of his conditioning and being able to play. He’s only been able to do a few workouts by himself.”
When the Gators open practice 
on Oct. 11, Florida will be with-out three key players — Yeguete, Carter and ﬁ  ve-star forward Chris Walker, who is still not enrolled at UF due to academic eligibility issues. Walker could join the team in mid-December at the earliest if he enrolls for the 2014 spring se-mester. 
“Starting the season, the team 
that’s on paper will not be our team,” Donovan said. 
“It’s just not. So I think trying 
to get our guys to come together as a team is the biggest challenge. We’re kind of disconnected right now, so this preseason, these ﬁ  rst practices, we have to do some team-building.”
