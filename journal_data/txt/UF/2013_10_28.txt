Police are still investigating a Friday night robbery that hap-
pened in the Midtown area, announced through a UF alert.
As an unidentiﬁ  ed man walked west along Fourth Avenue 
— a couple of blocks behind the University Avenue Chipo-
tle location — he was approached from behind by two men, wrote Gainesville Police spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias in an email.
The victim was hit from behind and fell to the ground, To-
bias said, and the men kept hitting him. 
They told the man, “Empty your pockets” and “Give me 
your phone.” They took his wallet and phone and retreated to the next street, Northwest 15th Street, where they joined two other men. The group then ran south toward University Avenue, Tobias said.
UF originally sent out an alert at about 10:30 p.m. announc-
ing someone had been robbed at 400 NW 15th Ave. outside of Lionsgate Condominium Association.
The alert described the four perpetrators as 20-somethings 
wearing hooded sweatshirts.
UF sent out a second alert near midnight on Friday noting 
that no more information at the time was available on the in-cident. Tobias indicated Sunday that the investigation is con-tinuing.
Residents are encouraged to call GPD with any questions 
at 352-955-1818.Police look into

Swamp Records is here to 
play. 
Rachel Ring, 20-year-old UF 
management senior and direc-
tor of Swamp Records, said the new university record label will focus on enhancing the careers of local Gainesville musicians.
“It’s a student-run record 
label under the umbrella of Student Government Produc-tions,” she said. “We want to enhance the careers of artists in and around the Gainesville community.”Swamp Records is the brain-
child of Ring and Breana Au-berry, who came up with the idea while interning in New York City this summer. 
Ring said the label will pro-
duce mainly hip-hop, electron-ic dance music and indie music because they’ve found it most popular among UF students.
Daniel Levin, a 21-year-
old UF industrial and systems engineering senior and chair-man of SGP, said that Swamp Records’ budget is “less than a couple thousand,” and funds are available on a case-by-case basis. 
Ring said they hope the 
program, which they call an educational experience for all students involved, will be sign-ing artists by 2014.
“This semester is purely about getting us ready, getting the resources in place,” she said. “Next semester, in 2014, is when we’re actually going to be out in the community and be working with these bands.”
The steps to signing an art-
ist into the label are still under works, but Ring said she hopes to have a preliminary process ready by the launch of their website, which will be within the next month.
Breana Auberry, a 20-year-
old advertising junior and the assistant head director of Swamp Records, said the idea of a student-run record label at UF isn’t a new one. 
She said that a nonfunction-
ing record label, called SGP Records, has existed for about 
UF to produce hip-hop, EDM and 
indie under its own record label

As students scramble to as-
semble DIY costumes, some thrift 
shops report increased trafﬁ  c from the younger crowd.
At Cecile’s Clothing Resale and 
Consignment Shop, owner Cendra Gier said she notices an increase in student shoppers during the fall. She said sought-after items depend “on the year and what’s cool.” 
The hot costume item this year, 
she said, is overalls.
Thrift 5, at 1227 W. University 
Ave., sees a younger crowd of shop-pers in general, said manager Emily Claire. She said the store has sold more than 15 full costumes since the beginning of October. 
Others come in search of speciﬁ  c 
pieces. She said a group of frater-nity brothers came into the store recently and left with Hawaiian shirts.Because costumes are in higher 
demand now, she said, they sell at a higher price point in comparison with other items. 
Ashley Pollan, a third-year UF 
law student, said she prefers thrift stores because of lower prices and a selection of unique items.
This year, the 24-year-old plans

my own costume,” she said. “I en-joy the process, ability to utilize my creativity … The end result always stands out.”Students pop some tags

Lillian Guerra, who works in the department of his-tory, will discuss her book “Visions of Power in Cuba: Revolution, Redemption, and Resistance” today at 3 p.m. in the Latin American Collection Reference Room, fourth floor of Smathers Library. In the tumultuous first decade of the Cuban Revolution, Fidel Castro and other leaders satu-rated the media with altruis-tic images of themselves in a campaign to win the hearts of Cuba’s six million citizens. In her book, Guerra argues these visual representations explained rapidly occurring events and encouraged radi-cal change and mutual self-sacrifice. Refreshments will be provided.

“They’ve held together all this 
time on a shoestring and a prayer,” George Kirkpatrick said of his ten-ants, the Hippodrome Theatre group. The group had been ne-gotiating a contract with the City of Gainesville to move into an old post office downtown. The nego-tiations took a turn for the better when it won a $175,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. It was expected to finalize the contract within a few weeks.
Oct. 28, 1993The green banana was assured 
of its future of being green. A state law passed to allow universities to plan future development, as well as future conservation. The legis-lature awarded UF and nine other universities $4.3 million to create long-range development and con-servation plans in compliance with the statute. The “physical master plan” projects the university’s im-age for the following 10 years.
Oct. 30, 2001A local woman led a slow-speed 
chase through a Walmart and its parking lot, which ended with  a charge of strong-arm robbery and an employee with scratches on his left hand. Lola Mae Monroe, a 69-year-old Gainesville woman, was seen pocketing $5 worth of makeup, and she fled the store. The employee chased her out into the parking lot, wanting her to come back into the store. She hit and attempted to bite him, even-tually throwing merchandise at his backup.

Facebook is starting to see a lot less face time. 
About 23 percent of 8,650 teenagers surveyed 
in Piper Jaffray’s 26th Semi-Annual “Taking Stock with Teens” Market Research Project cited Facebook as the most important social media platform, down from 42 percent the year before. 
Twitter was cited as the most 
important.
But Bruce Floyd, UF’s social 
media specialist, said he’s skep-tical about the research provid-ed in the study and needed to examine it before agreeing with the trend.
“What (teenagers) say they 
like is different from what they 
use,” he said.
Anna Cesarotti, a 19-year-old UF sociology 
and sustainability studies sophomore, said she hasn’t had a Facebook account for more than a year.
“I was overwhelmed by Facebook,” she said.Cesarotti said she felt keeping up with Fa-
cebook was too much like maintenance, so she choose to delete her account before starting col-lege.
Although the study shows teen Facebook us-
ers are down, some UF students still think there is a need for it to stay connected on campus.
Lizbeth Ramos, an 18-year-old UF exploratory 
freshman, said she recently reactivated her Face-book after not having one for almost three years because she felt it was necessary for college.
“Everything is done through Facebook,” she 
said.
Ramos said most of the organizations at UF 
use Facebook to advertise events, meetings and other information. Without it, she wouldn’t be able to stay up to date.

purposes,” she said.Teenagers more interested in

With his oven burning at tem-

Black, 29, is getting ready to

Black said his truck name was 
inspired by the Ameraucana type of chickens he raises on his farm. 
“It … says something about 
the theme of the business,” he said. “I’m using domestic ingre-dients to make something that is great.”
He will serve pizzas and oth-

Prices range from about $7 to

said he got burned out working in the Philadelphia fine-dining scene, so he brought his skills back to Gainesville.
“I wanted to do something

UF’s College of Medicine is building a new 
education center in its efforts to move from a 
disciplined-based program to a patient-cen-tered one.
The official groundbreaking will take place 
Nov. 22 at noon across from the Evelyn F. McKnight Brain Institute. The cost of the proj-ect is estimated at $45 million. 
“The building is going to be an education building for the medical students as well as the physician assistant students,” said Karen Dooley, spokeswoman for the College of Med-icine. 
The original building was built in the 1950s 
and refurbished in the 1970s, Dooley said. 
“Whenever I’m in the medical buildings, a 
lot of it feels old and run down, so I’m really excited to be proud of it,” said Holly Carnell, a 21-year-old UF biochemistry senior, who will start medical school in Fall 2104. 
Carnell said the new building — which is 
being built west of the brain institute on New-ell Drive — will be more impressive and at-tract prospective medical school students.
De-Vaughn Williams, a 21-year-old UF food science and human nutrition senior, echoed Carnell.
“It’s definitely old,” he said, “especially 
when you get to the ground floors. It gets dreary looking. It will be really nice to have a new building.”
Dooley said she thinks a more comfortable 
learning environment will be beneficial to stu-dents, some of whom spend up to 12 hours a day in the facility. In addition, the building will contain more space for the growing num-ber of incoming students.
After the new building opens, the College 
of Medicine will be implementing a new learn-ing style, called “experiential” or “simulation” learning. It allows students to practice medical procedures using dummies.
“You can have all the book knowledge or 
classroom knowledge you want, but the more realistic they can make learning the material, the better you’ll be able to draw on that mate-rial when you need to perform,” Carnell said. 
Construction is expected to be completed 
in Fall 2015.
“We’re optimistic we will meet our target-
ing date,” Dooley said. “If all goes well, hope-fully the freshman will be able to be in this.”

Apps and interactive web-
sites took center stage at the 
second annual Startup Week-end Gainesville, where inven-tors formed ideas and work teams to make concepts reali-ties. 
The competitive event, 
which ran from Friday until Sunday night, spawned ideas such as Bounce, an app that connects stranded students with student drivers, and Game On, an app that helps users organize pickup games of basketball or other sports.
Ten idea pitches were se-
lected for inclusion in the com-petition, and about 70 people participated throughout the project teams. 
Scientist and UF alumnus 
Aleksander Levental pitched the idea for Waitr, a mobile ap-plication restaurants can use to receive orders from custom-ers as well as feedback. It also alerts restaurant workers when a returning customer who logged a previous negative ex-perience comes in. 
Turned Up Technology, 
which placed second, was the only hardware-based entry. It turns off music in earbuds when they are taken out of a user’s ears and turns on when users put them in. 
Levental, whose Waitr app 
took first place, said the at-mosphere created at Startup Weekend was key in bringing his idea to fruition.
He said it provided all the 
necessary resources from de-sign and business mentors to working spaces that allow teams to efficiently collaborate.
Addison Killebrew, a 20-
year-old UF event manage-ment sophomore, was a part of the Waitr team. He said he joined the competition to use his creative side by making something people can use rath-er than just consuming.
Orrett Davis, global startup 
weekend facilitator, said the weekend is the best experi-ential education for entrepre-neurship.
“This weekend provides a 
safe environment for entrepre-neurs to test their ideas and get feedback,” he said.
Anjali Kundra, Startup 
Weekend lead organizer, said the weekend is all about team-building and opening up to new ideas.
Kundra said the weekend 
gives people the tools to get started in the entrepreneur community and encourages them to think differently.
Martin Schaffel, mentor and 
judge for the competition, said he looked for the “buy abil-ity” of a business — whether a product solves a problem and whether producing it is fea-sible.
Winning entries were 
awarded with about $10,000 collectively in services, includ-ing consulting and attorney services, to aid the launch of the startups. Startup weekend

Foodie Instagrammers can now 
earn rewards for sharing their ob-
sessions on social media. 
Stealz, which recently expand-
ed to Gainesville, is a free app that rewards users for sharing photos of participating businesses.
When making a purchase, users 
scan a QR code and share photos on Facebook or Twitter and ac-cumulate points to exchange for deals, said spokeswoman Kirsten Kalsky. The app is available for download on the iPhone and An-droid through the App Store or Google Play. 
Rewards from the app vary 
with each business. 
Matt Aschenbrener, manager 
at How Do You Roll?, said the res-taurant offers an instant reward of miso soup for downloading the app and other incentives at 10, 20 and 25 points. Users can earn one point for checking in and two points after sharing a photo on Fa-cebook or Twitter. 
Big Lou’s Pizzeria manager 
Jordan Pfeiffer said customers are taking notice of the app. Rewards at Big Lou’s include a free slice of pizza or six free garlic rolls. When a user reaches 50 points, he or she receives 50 percent off of an order. 
Pfeiffer said it is a convenient 
way for students to save money.
“I think people in our day and 
age are using smartphones more and more,” she said. “Stealz is a great app, especially in a college town where kids start out kind of broke.”
Other Gainesville businesses 
covered by the app include Burrito Famous, Pita Pit and Relish.

Swamp Records, run by UF students, hopes to sign artists in 2014
two years.
“SGP Records is an idea that wasn’t fully developed or 
put in action completely, and that’s why we rebranded it as Swamp Records,” she said. 
Jared Glosser, a 21-year-old UF history senior and the events 
director for Swamp Records, said the short-term goal for the organization is to sign at least one or two artists in 2014.
“Long term, in the next five to 10 years, we want to have 
artists that have come through and been a part of Swamp Re-cords make it big,” he said. 
The Swamp Records team is currently made up of about 20 
people, Auberry said, and they are looking to learn as they go on this project.

A new shipment of flu 
shots are in, and students 
can get the vaccine through Friday.
“This shipment was al-
ready planned months ago,” said Catherine Seemann, a spokeswoman for the Stu-dent Health Care Center.
UF doesn’t order the sea-
sonal influenza vaccines from one manufacturer, she said. 
It orders from multiple 
manufacturers in case there is an issue with the shots or delay from the manufactur-ers. 
“So this way we don’t put 
all our eggs in one basket,” Seemann said.
She said about 4,000 shots 
have been given this season compared to 2,500 this time last year.
Seemann said this year 
the SHCC did expect to give out more shots, but the num-ber was more than originally estimated.
Evelyn De la Vega said 
she has a busy schedule and doesn’t have enough time to schedule an appointment at Walgreens or CVS. 
“I think it’s great that I can 
just walk in the (SHCC) and get my flu shot every year on campus without having to plan ahead,” said the 20-year-old UF public relations senior.
Seemann said the most 
common mistake students make is thinking they are healthy and don’t need the shot. 
A healthy immune sys-
tem helps fight off infections. However, it does not make students immune to the sea-sonal flu.
Seasonal flu begins af-
ter Thanksgiving break and peaks in February. But stu-dents should not wait until the last minute to get the vac-cine, Seemann said. 
It takes two weeks for the 
antibodies from the shot to build in the body’s system, so students should get the vaccine as soon as possible, Seemann said.
“The flu shot is extremely 
important to all students, and it is literally the No. 1 way to prevent the seasonal flu,” she said.Flu shots back at

A new study found that creating 
music while exercising might make 
workouts more effective, but some locals are hesitant to concur.
In the study, researchers at the 
Max Planck Institute for Human Cognition and Brain Sciences in-stalled electronic kits into various exercise machines that would mu-sically respond to the person using the machine. Participants who used the machines generated smoother movements, used less oxygen and reported exercise felt less strenuous.
But Heather Hausenblas, a UF exercise psychologist, said she’s skeptical about whether the same results could be duplicated.
“They were distracted from their 
workout and focusing on the music they were making, so it seemed that they were putting less effort into their workout,” she said.Sheila Gardner, director of group 
fitness at Gainesville Health & Fit-ness Center, said she’s unsure if there’s an advantage to creating music over listening to music while working out. 
“I’ve had classes before where 
you can just feel the energy leaving the room, and usually the first thing I do is say, ‘Let’s change the song,’” Gardner said.
Raphael Konforti, a 22-year-old 
UF sports management graduate student and a personal trainer, said  the old standby of listening to a per-sonal iPod at the gym is probably just as good.

With animal treats recently linked to illnesses and death, lo-
cal pet owners may need to be more cautious when walking 
down the pet aisle.
About 600 pets have died since 2007 and thousands have 
gotten ill from jerky treats, according to a Food and Drug Ad-ministration news release. The FDA is urging customers to re-port symptoms.
Richard Hill, a UF College of Veterinary Medicine associ-
ate professor, said it’s difficult to attribute the outbreak to one specific factor.
Veterinarians have seen specific instances of clinical signs, specifically a rare kidney disorder called Fanconi syndrome, that are associated with these jerky treats, Hill said. 
“It may be that the source of the treats changed,” he said. “It 
may be that a lot of them came from China or that something changed when the treats were processed.”
Hill suspects jerky treats from China are responsible. “Unfortunately, it’s not possible to tell just by looking at the 
packages where the treats came from,” he said. 
Pet owners can stray away from giving treats or stick to 
purchasing them from major manufacturers. They have better control of where they are getting their treats from, Hill said.
CJ Hall, a 21-year-old UF pre-vet senior, fosters animals but 
does not purchase dog treats.
“It’s just shocking,” he said. Jerky treats linked to pet deaths, cause concern for owners

A local conservation organization will 
host its first Halloween ball on Friday. 
The Alachua Conservation Trust ball is a chance for attendees to enjoy Swamp Head 
brews in their best Halloween costumes while supporting the conservation organi-zation, said Ivor Kincaide, land manager for the trust.
The sea monsters-themed event will in-clude live music from folk indie rock band the Wild Shiners and a costume contest with a category for the best sea monster. 
The fundraiser will take place at the Prai-
rie Creek Lodge from 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. Tickets are $40 each, and all proceeds will go to the trust’s mission of conserving critical natural and historical resources. Students receive a 50 percent discount on admission at the door.Organizers decided to host the Halloween 
ball because they noticed the number of Hal-loween celebrations offered in Gainesville wasn’t as high as it usually is, said Chris Burney, project manager for the trust.
The trust was created in 1988 and has 
since assisted in preserving more than 50,000 acres of land in the North Central Florida area. Forty years ago, there were only 2,000 acres of land set aside for conservation.

flu shot every year on 
campus without having

Chris Brown was arrested early Sunday morning in Wash-
ington, D.C., on felony assault charges, but hey, we’ll probably forget about it in a few weeks or so.
According to The Washington Post, Brown had been sched-
uled to host a party Saturday night. On Sunday morning just before 4:30 a.m., Brown and his bodyguard, Christopher Hol-losy, were reportedly involved in a “physical altercation” with an unidentiﬁ  ed man, who was later taken to a nearby hospital and released.
Brown and Hollosy will remain in custody until their sched-
uled court appearance today.
Despite the fact that Brown has been on probation since 2009 
after pleading guilty to attacking his former girlfriend, Rihanna, he’s continued to produce music while ﬂ  oating in and out of the public eye — most recently over a parking-space dispute with R&B artist Frank Ocean in February in Los Angeles.
You’d think maybe he’d want to keep a low proﬁ  le, given his 
reputation will probably never recover from the 2009 Rihanna incident. However, this recent assault charge is only one in a long line of highly publicized incidents involving the singer.
In August, Brown went on a rage-fueled Twitter rant and ac-
cused the Los Angeles District Attorney’s Ofﬁ  ce of racism af-ter he was ordered to perform 1,000 more community service hours, according to NBC News.
The increased community-service hours agreement was 
reached after Brown’s previously revoked probation from 2009 was reinstated following a hit-and-run accident in May.
After the new community-service agreement, Brown tweet-
ed, “How about y’all take care of all the homeless kids and fami-lies on skid row. Promote helping people that are really f***ed up in your city!”
The Los Angeles prosecutors have said in court ﬁ  lings report-
ed by The Associated Press that they could ﬁ  nd no evidence that Brown ever completed the community-service hours he was originally ordered after his 2009 conviction.
And there it is. For the past four years, despite a few hiccups, it’s been busi-
ness as usual for Brown. It’s perfectly cyclical: Every once in a while he’ll do something stupid — such as throwing a tantrum after a “Good Morning America” appearance — the incident will be highly publicized, people will inevitably bring up the Rihanna incident and then everyone conveniently forgets about it. Meanwhile, nothing changes — he obviously hasn’t addressed his anger issues, and he isn’t completing his court-ordered com-munity service hours. 
Will this incident be any different?Because Brown is on probation in California for his 2009 do-
mestic violence conviction, any arrests could be viewed as a vio-lation of his probation and result in jail time, according to CNN. 
However, Brown is a cash cow for his label. The mixtapes and 
full-length albums have brought in revenue, and it goes unsaid that he’ll have the best legal representation money can buy. 
It’s likely he’ll evade jail time — as well as being held ac-
countable for his actions.

the Science Guy in elementary school?Today’s question: Is UF making its own record label a 
good use of student money?Saudi women drive rights argument home
A revolution can start with the simplest of ac-
tions.
On Saturday, dozens of women in Saudi Ara-
bia made a statement by driving. The Middle Eastern country has no law prohibiting females from driving, but it’s considered a taboo in the conservative Islamic culture dominated by an authoritative monarchy. 
Saudi Arabia is the only country in the world that 
prohibits women from getting behind the wheel. It’s considered just as offensive for women to vote or run for ofﬁ  ce. Although King Abdullah has recognized that perhaps by 2015 women will have the opportunity to vote, he didn’t give women the green light on the Oct. 26 campaign. 
Despite the monarch’s dismissal and warnings from 
mosque clerics being broadcast in the days before the campaign, about 40 Saudi women made their statement this weekend. A half-dozen YouTube videos were post-ed showing mothers, sisters and daughters driving the roads of Jeddah, Riyadh, Mecca and other Saudi cities. 
In 1990, more than a dozen women were imprisoned 
by the Saudi government for defying the defacto ban. When they were released, some lost their jobs. Saudi Arabia qualiﬁ  es as the 130th out of 134 countries in gen-der parity, according to a report from the World Eco-nomic Forum. It was also the only country to get a score of “0” for the political empowerment of women.
But that doesn’t mean women have been silent. The 
Arab Spring sparked the ﬂ  ame of activism in 2011, when Manal al-Sharif, a 34-year-old female computer scien-tist, started a Facebook page called “Women2Drive,” which had “Teach me to drive so I can protect myself” as its slogan.
She posted a video of herself driving, which received 
support both domestically and abroad by women’s rights advocates. Shortly after, she was arrested and detained by the Committee for the Protection of Virtue and Prevention of Vice. The se-cret religious police also started an initiative to notify husbands and brothers of the whereabouts of their female counterparts by text message in 2012. This weekend, al-Sharif fearlessly organized women all over the country to get on the roads.  
Women weren’t alone in their rebellion. Singer and 
YouTube sensation Alaa Wardi who grew up in Saudi Arabia showed his support for the campaign with a Bob Marley song as a satire of the government’s gender-re-strictive ban. “No Woman, No Drive” got more than 1.9 million views in just one day. It’s only a matter of time for the ultra-traditional Saudi government to realize most of the world won’t stand for sexism anymore.
It’s not about driving: It’s about being treated like a 
capable human being who has the right to mobilize and take control of her own life.
Although we’re not subject to government or reli-
gious persecution, women in the U.S. should take a les-son from our Saudi sisters. They put themselves on the line to advance their own dignity and safety, in spite of the backlash they might receive from authority. 
We have our own driving to do. The way we are 
treated by our male-powered society should reﬂ  ect how we want to be treated. 
As these women take the steering wheel into their 
own hands, so should American women. Next time I get into my car, I will take a deep breath of gratitude for having the right to drive, to vote and to do most things my male colleagues can do.
Now, onward women. We still have a way to go on 
this road to equality.

The highly anticipated 
ﬁ  lm adaptation of Orson Scott Card’s “Ender’s 
Game” hits movie screens across the country Friday. I haven’t read the much-herald-ed novel — or its subsequent sequels — but by all accounts, it’s a great novel. If the ﬁ  lm is successful, it will likely launch yet another franchise based on a wildly popular series of young adult novels, follow-ing in the footsteps of “Harry Potter,” “Twilight” and the “Hunger Games,” to name a few.
While that’s all well 
and good, the man behind “Ender’s Game” doesn’t seem to live up to the heroics of his book’s main character.
It makes sense that a sci-
ence-ﬁ  ction author might be a little kooky, but Card — who serves as a producer on the ﬁ  lm and stands to proﬁ  t great-ly if “Ender’s Game” scores a box ofﬁ  ce win — is a bigot, a homophobe and pretty much suggested President Barack Obama is the next Hitler.
The evidence against Card 
is overwhelming: He recently called on Congress to outlaw gay marriage and then sug-gested that Obama was going to create a citizen police force by arming street gangs and letting them dispatch Obama’s enemies, while the president secretly organizes a plot to have Michelle Obama elect-ed president in 2016 — and then plans to run the country through her. 
It sounds like a pretty swell 
idea for a pulpy political thrill-er, best saved for long days at the beach next summer, but not reality. Sadly, Card be-lieves all of this to be true.
Card’s views are danger-
ous, delusional and shame-ful. And he’s not alone. He joins a chorus of the American public, who generally take to the Internet to share its out-rageous views, without any shame for how bigoted they may appear. 
All too often, we turn a 
blind eye or a deaf ear to the shenanigans emanating from the mouths of deranged peo-ple like Card. Yes, the First Amendment provides very strong protections to our right to free speech — as it should — but that doesn’t mean the American people should have to listen to this crap. 
Since the president took 
ofﬁ  ce, celebrities like Don-ald Trump regularly ques-tion Obama’s place of birth. A member of Congress called him a tar baby, and all too of-ten — and much like Card — Obama’s policies have been equated to those of Hitler.
The media does a ﬁ  ne job 
reporting on the nonsensical and downright offensive be-liefs of pseudo-celebrities and celebrities alike, but far too of-ten, we fail to tell these people they’re wrong. 
Folks like Trump, Card, Ted 
Nugent, Tea Party politicians, Pat Robertson and countless others get their asinine quotes in any number of articles, TV news segments and blogs, but it’s due time the press and the American people tell them that it’s enough. 
Free speech is powerful, 
but what’s more powerful is a nation, where all of us — re-gardless of race, sexual orien-tation, religious beliefs, gen-der, ethnicity, or anything else that makes us different — are created equal.
Fortunately, the haters are 
thinning in numbers, even as they attempt to shout from the mountaintops. 
Sorry, guys, you’re losing. Nasty views like Card’s ex-
isted in this country long be-fore he opened his mouth, but in a nation that claims to be a tolerant place and a shelter for the huddled masses, some do their damnedest to keep the U.S. a club for wealthy, straight white males. 
Obama’s election, along 
with an expansion of rights for our gay and lesbian friends shocked some of our fellow Americans and, unfortunate-ly, their reaction wasn’t one of understanding or respect. 
Civil rights has come a 
long way since our nation’s founding. It’s just too bad a few ignorant people didn’t come along for the ride. How-ever, the great thing about this country is there’s always room to get on board.
So, Mr. Card, won’t you 
join us?

‘Ender’s Game’ 
author’s bigoted views in the minorityColumn
Iran‘s nuclear program became a chal-
lenge 10 years ago. Some parts of the international community, represent-
ed by the permanent members  of United Nations Security Council and Germany (P5+1), are exposing their concern about possible military dimensions of Iran’s nuclear pro-gram, and Iran is operating on peaceful purposes of its program. 
P5+1 has passed several unilateral and multi-
lateral sanctions to stop Iran’s nuclear program. Meanwhile, Iran and P5+1 had several rounds of meetings to reach a deal. Iran is seeking two goals. 
First, Iran wants P5+1 to recognize and respect 
its right to have a complete nuclear fuel cycle as a member of NPT.  
Second, Iran wants all of the sanctions to be lift-
ed. On the other hand, P5+1 wants to ensure Iran’s nuclear program remains exclusively peaceful, as declared by Iran. A win-win deal can be deﬁ  ned when the goals of both sides are pursued simulta-neously. Otherwise, such a deal is not achievable, according to the long history of negotiations. The sanctions affected ordinary people’s lives in Iran but not its nuclear program — which has advanced considerably during the last ten years. Therefore, neither P5+1 nor Iran has reached their goals. Now, the question is how this challenge can be resolved.
On June 14, Iran experienced a different outcome 
than the controversial election in June 2009. About 73 percent of Iranians participated in the presiden-tial election, and the majority voted for a moderate candidate with the “key of hope and prudence.”  
Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s new president, called his foreign policy “charm offensive.” His administration wants to show a new and true face of Iran to the world. Presi-dent Rouhani truly understood the U.S. played the “key” role in P5+1 and hence accepted bilateral meetings with the U.S. 
on side meetings with P5+1.  
But the U.S. should also show its seriousness 
in ﬁ  nding a win-win deal. It cannot put a gun on Iran’s head and then ask for negotiations. President Obama used the same reasoning to refuse negotia-tion with Republicans during the recent government shutdown. In particular, if Congress wants to play the role of bad cop and constantly pass sanctions to enforce Iran to give up its rights, the negotiations will certainly reach stalemate as before.   
New talks between Iran and P5+1 started last 
month in New York and continued last week in Ge-neva. The “key” of success in the new negotiations is to pursue common goals — not competitive ones. Iran’s new foreign minister announced that Iran has nothing to hide and is ready for full transparency under international regulations, which can guaran-tee the goal of P5+1. 
Now, if P5+1 shows its willingness to Iran’s 
aforementioned goals, a win-win deal is achiev-able. 
Fortunately, both sides initially agreed on Iran’s 
road map to pursue the common goals. 
Commitment of both sides to this road map and 
further negotiations about the details can hopefully lead to an equilibrium solution in 2014.
Saeed Ghadimi is a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the 
UF’s department of industrial and system engineering.
On Monday, The Hufﬁ  ngton Post reported 2013’s six cases of stu-dents aged 5 to 14 who were ex-
pelled from their schools for possession of a ﬁ  rearm. No shootings resulted from the minors’ possession of guns.
In one case, a middle school in Virginia suspended 
two students for playing with airsoft guns in one of the kids’ front yard. Of his house. Not the campus. Not the school bus, not even the bus stop. Unless something is done with respect to this, their school’s permanent record will forever say these students were in possession of a ﬁ  rearm.
Of course, guns are a complex topic, as illustrated 
by the nation’s ongoing debate over gun laws, but for small children, a basic analogy relating guns to scissors or knives would probably be enough — since they are both relatively harmless and useful tools but potentially dangerous.
The older the children are, the more apt they are 
to be able to understand the severity of a real gun on campus and to comprehend why their behavior with the gun was inappropriate. Kidshealth.org has parent, teen and child sections talking about guns and how to explain their dangers to children.
As for the case of the Virginian middle schoolers, 
that one is just ridiculous.

Rainbow colors flooded Bo Diddley 
Community Plaza on Saturday at 
Gainesville’s annual Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Fes-tival.
The day included a parade, shops, 
advocacy booths, food and live music in the downtown plaza. 
This year’s festival stands out be-
cause it also commemorates the over-turning of the national Defense of Marriage Act, said Terry Fleming, co-president of the North Central Florida Pride Community Center, which hosts the festivities.
“The community is excited,” he 
said.
The event typically sees about 5,000 people throughout the day and about 1,500 people in the plaza at any given time, Fleming said.
This year’s turnout was about the 
same as last year’s, he said, but he noted that Pride attendance has been growing over time. He said this year’s parade included more floats.
“You can see the response,” he said. 
“People are into it.”
Fleming added that one of the 
reasons the festival is held so late in the year, instead of in the summer to commemorate the Stonewall riots, is to tap into the student community in Gainesville while it is nearby for classes. 
“You can’t engage the student pop-
ulation in the summer,” he said.
Some students who attended the 
festival said they appreciate how open Gainesville is to the LGBTQ commu-nity. 
“People are pretty open about it,” 
said Laura Robayo, a 22-year-old UF first-year pharmacy student. “It’s not a big deal to see someone who is gay.”
Others came from out of town to at-
tend the events. 
Bethany Powers, a 20-year-old 
waitress of Ocala, said she came to the event because Pride events don’t hap-pen in her town.
“Any Pride we hear about, we’re 
like, ‘Hey, let’s go to that,’” she said. Overturning of DOMA celebrated 
at Gainesville’s Pride festival

Former Gator subpoenaed 
Mike Pouncey was served a grand jury subpoena in 
Massachusetts related to the investigation of Aaron Hernandez, Sports Illustrated reported Sunday.Antoinette Bannister and UF women’s basketball are looking to ﬁ  nd a defensive identity. Read the story on page 14.JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Writer @jczupryn
Florida’s defense was one of the 
strongest in the nation in 2012-13. 
This year’s unit has work to do 
before it reaches that level of pro-
duction.
Last season, the Gators limited 
opponents to a 38.2 ﬁ  eld goal per-centage, which was the best in the Southeastern Conference.
Florida also ﬁ  nished ﬁ  rst in the 
nation, allowing 54.4 points per game en route to a third consecu-tive trip to the Elite Eight.
Fewer than two weeks from the start of this season, coach Billy Donovan believes the unit has re-gressed considerably.
“We’re nowhere near the de-
fensive team we were a year ago,” Donovan said. 
“I mean we’re not even remote-
ly close.”
Donovan has stressed the im-
portance of remaining poised dur-ing games, which was a problem at times last season, to this year’s unit.
“There were times where ad-
versity would hit our team,” he said. 
“We would get fractured. And I don’t mean fractured from the standpoint of guys ﬁ  nger-point-ing. 
“But Scottie (Wilbekin) turns 
the ball over (and) he’s consumed with the turnover and he’s down or he’s disappointed in himself and he’s consumed with that play. 
MICHELLE PROVENZANO
Alligator Writer @mmprovenzano
Coach Becky Burleigh’s most potent force on Florida’s of-
fensive attack continues to score goals.
Savannah Jordan embodies everything Burleigh wants in a 
forward: physicality, persistence, quickness and precision. 
On Sunday, the freshman scored two goals to help Florida 
earn a 2-0 upset against Southeastern Conference leader Texas 
A&M at James G. Pressly Stadium.
“Her consistency is pretty remarkable as a freshman,” Bur-
leigh said. 
“We saw that last year with Christen 
Westphal, and it’s pretty unusual, so it’s great to see that.”
After a choppy ﬁ  rst half, Florida came 
out strong in the attack after halftime know-ing Jordan was ready and waiting to score.
The freshman was farther back from her 
post in the box and used the width to her advantage.
Jordan ran up the ﬁ  eld and into the left side of the box to 
take a shot on goal. 
Texas A&M goalkeeper Jordan Day deﬂ  ected the ball out 
short — putting it in a prime position for Jordan to riﬂ  e a shot into the right corner of the goal.
“I just continued my run and followed it,” Jordan said.“It wasn’t the prettiest goal, but it went in, and I’m hap-
py.”
The Aggies put an emphasis on a high back line to limit the 
Gators’ opportunities, but Florida retaliated by sending one of its own defenders in on attack.
Westphal, a center back, drove the ball into the Aggies half, 
stopped shy of the arc and sent a pass to Jordan in the left of the box. 
Jordan ran the ball up and shot it before Aggies defenders 
could close in on her, ﬁ  nding the right corner for the second Freshman tallies 
two goals to lead 
Florida to victory UF defense seeking improvement

Somehow, some way, Florida is still in the hunt for a 
trip to Atlanta.
Despite two of the worst played games since the 
John Brantley era, the Gators still (almost) control their own path to the Southeastern Conference Championship Game.
With two conference losses, UF is tied for second in the 
SEC Eastern Division with Georgia and South Carolina be-hind one-loss Missouri.
Thanks to the Gamecocks’ win against the Tigers on Sat-
urday, the Gators still have a shot.
What Florida needs to do is win out and pray for more 
teams to beat Mizzou. The Tigers hold the head-to-head tie-breaker against the Gators because of Florida’s awful showing against Missouri on the road, but UF’s sea-son is not over.
The Gators have the “easy” 
part. Just win.
Their quest begins on Saturday 
in Jacksonville when they take on the Bulldogs. Both teams have 
been wracked by injuries, which have caused Florida and Georgia fans to lament for the season that might have been. If you’re sitting in the ﬁ  rst few rows, stay hydrated. You might be called into action if things get too rough.
Then, Vanderbilt comes to The Swamp for Florida’s 
homecoming game. The game that features parades, pag-eantry and Gator Growl is picked before the season starts and is intended to be a contest the Gators will win easily in front of all the alumni who grace Gainesville for the week-end.
However, homecoming has been rough for UF recently. 
From 2010 on, Florida is 2-1 in homecoming games against Mississippi State, Vanderbilt and Louisiana-Lafayette. The biggest win? A seven-point victory on a last-second blocked Gators need multiple lucky breaks to make it to AtlantaSEE HOOPS, PAGE 15

Several Gators react to scoring a point during Florida’s three-set victory against Auburn on Friday in the 
O’Connell Center. With nine matches remaining in the regular season, Florida is second in the Southeastern Conference to undefeated No. 11 Missouri. The two teams play for a second time this season on Nov. 15.

The buzz around the Gators this pre-
season has been about their new, fluid 
offense that incorporates the transition game. 
But what about Florida’s defense?Last season, the Gators were 12th in 
the Southeastern Conference in scoring defense and 11th in the SEC in field goal percentage defense. 
Making matters worse, Florida lost 
Jennifer George, the team’s defensive an-chor last season, to graduation. George led the team with 5.2 defensive rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game in 2012-13. 
Sydney Moss, who was second on the 
team with 4.7 defensive rebounds last season, transferred. 
Without George and Moss, new play-
ers will be needed to help build a consis-tent defense.
Sophomore Antoinette Bannister said 
she thinks Jaterra Bonds and Carlie Nee-dles are going to pick up the slack.
“They’re role models to me,” Bannis-ter said. “I really love the way they play defense. They lock down. I look at them everyday and I’m like, ‘Dang, I want to be like them.’ I want to be a great defend-er. I don’t want to be just an offensive player that can’t guard anybody. I want to be great on both ends.”
The question still remains: How will 
the defensive philosophy shift in accor-dance to a new offense that depends on an up-and-down, frenetic style? 
“Defensively, I feel like we’re a lot 
the same as we were last year,” redshirt junior Kayla Lewis said. “A lot of inter-changeability with the pieces that we have. 
“A lot of people talk about our offense 
being fast and fluid. I think our defense will be just as fast and just as fluid. We haven’t done a lot of full court things, but I know in the half-court we’re going to be just as aggressive as we were last year.”
With a new offense that coach Aman-
da Butler said could seem chaotic at first, establishing a defensive identity could prove challenging. There will inevitably be kinks on both sides of the ball when implementing a new paradigm. 
Butler knows that. Her players do, 
too. 
The buzzword that keeps reoccurring 
about building a successful defense is communication. 
“If we just talk and let each other 
know we have each other’s back, I feel like we’ll be fine on offense and defense,” Bannister said.
Still, questions remain. How will another year without the 
big-bodied Viktorija Dimaite take its toll? Who will step up on the rebound-ing front with the departures of George and Moss? 
The Gators hope the fluidity from the 
offense translates to the defense.
“We’ve worked on our transition 
game and changed our defense when it comes to attacking,” sophomore Christin Mercer said. 
“With the guards in a smaller post, 
we’ll be able to run the majority of the team to have a set half-court game. … Since we’re so versatile and so guard-like, we can move.”

punt against the Ragin’ Cajuns last 
year.
So, if Florida survives homecom-
ing, it will travel to Columbia, S.C., to face No. 14 USC in Williams-Brice Stadium with an SEC title game berth still within the realm of possibility.The Gators had a bad day the 
last time they played in a town named Columbia, but they need to shake those memories and pull out a win against the Ol’ Ball Coach, Steve Spurrier. 
It’s possible — South Carolina is 
in the middle of an up-and-down season that includes a loss to Ten-nessee and narrow victories against UCF and Kentucky.
But even if the Gators win out, 
they would still need assistance to reach Atlanta. The Tigers need to lose at least twice. 
Missouri still has a tough road 
ahead of it. A somewhat resur-gent Tennessee team is next on the schedule.
The Volunteers nearly pulled 
off an upset against the Bulldogs before knocking off the Gamecocks as part of a topsy-turvy week for the SEC. 
Things returned to some sem-
blance of normality last week as Al-abama blew out Tennessee, but the Vols have another chance to defeat a division leader and send the SEC into anarchy against the Tigers.
Kentucky follows Tennessee on 
Mizzou’s schedule. This is as close to a surefire win as any SEC game. Next.
The Tigers’ final two games will 
be their toughest. An upstart Ole Miss squad that already took down a top-10 LSU team followed by the Texas A&M Fightin’ Johnny Foot-balls await Missouri.
Assuming the Tigers win those 
first two games as the heavy fa-vorite, Florida fans will need their friends in Oxford, Miss., and Col-lege Station, Texas, to do them some big favors.
The Rebels have already shown 
the ability to play with the confer-ence big boys, and the Aggies have the ability to beat any team in the conference on any given Saturday thanks to the pairing of Johnny Manziel and Mike Evans.
Missouri needs to lose both of 
those games for Florida to make it to the SEC title game.  That way, the Gators can receive the honor of be-ing obliterated by Nick Saban and the Crimson Tide — a noble fate Florida would be lucky to enjoy.Another guy missed a little short jump-hook in the lane 
or missed a layup and he’s consumed with that play. And before you know it, you’ve got guys that are all kind of involved in their own little world.”
Center Patric Young said there is hope for this year’s 
team to match and even surpass the defense of a year ago. But much like Donovan, Young has placed an added em-phasis on team defense.
“We can’t go in there expecting to just walk in and be 
good on that same level,” Young said. “I think we don’t trust each other as well on defense as far as knowing that there’s a next man there to help you out. Because that’s all what defense is about: help.” 
Donovan said his players are 
not passing the blame or being selfish. Instead, they are beating themselves up so much for bad 
plays that they forget they have the rest of the team to help on the following play. 
Even without Will Yeguete (knee) and several other 
Gators who are battling injuries, Donovan said the defense will make great strides if the remaining players can have short memories.
“Sometimes our guys, at times, have been way too hard 
on themselves,” he said. 
“They make a mistake, they get so upset and frustrated 
and down on themselves and don’t realize there’s another play coming. Because if you’re going back on defense and you’re coming off of a turnover, you still have an opportu-nity to stop them. But you’re not going to stop them if one of you’re guys is worrying about the previous play and is not engaged in the next play.”
Michael Frazier II, who played under Donovan for the 
USA men’s U19 team over the summer, said he knows first-hand how easily it is to get caught up in mistakes af-ter he struggled with his shot in the FIBA tournament.
“Talking with my coaches that were there with me, 
they were saying I was just thinking about it too much,” Frazier said. “That’s something we all can get better at as a team.” MONDAY, OCTOBER 28, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Texas A&M took 10 shots 
during scoreless second half
time on Sunday.
“It was great defending by [outside 
back Tessa Andujar and Westphal],” 
Jordan said. 
“They doubled down on the girl and 
got the ball. Christen’s bringing the ball forward, so I just kind of got out. She looked up at me, made eye contact and just played a great ball.”
Westphal added: “I really didn’t 
know what to do after it happened … I was kind of just frantic, but it was awe-some. I’ve been looking for it for the past couple games because I like to get forward as a center back.” 
The goal was Jordan’s second of the 
game and 18th of the season.
Texas A&M was relentless trying to 
battle back, taking 10 shots during the second half. 
“We just needed to settle down a 
little bit,” Jordan said. “We were a little anxious. I think ev-
eryone was a little nervous about this game because it was a big one. At half-time, we just kind of calmed down, took a second breath, and when we came out, we just started playing the way we normally play.”
Florida’s victory was its fifth straight 
shutout and keeps the Gators (14-3-1, 8-2 SEC) in contention for an SEC title as they stand tied for first in the confer-ence with the Aggies (13-4-1, 8-2 SEC).
“We’ve got one more step to take,” 
Burleigh said “That’s going to be Thurs-day night against a very good Georgia team.”soCCeR , from page 12

With the score tied at 21 in the 
second set, it appeared that Flor-
ida could be in for a battle with Tennessee. 
The Volunteers opened the set 
on a 12-5 run after the Gators won the first set. 
But a controversial attack error 
by Tennessee junior middle block-er Shealyn Kolosky sparked a six-point run for Florida, which won the set and cruised to a sweep. 
“We got the kill by Alex (Hol-
ston) and then the attack error came, but there were two back-to-back digs by Taylor (Unroe) that were the separator in the second set,” coach Mary Wise said
The No. 5 Gators improved 
their record to 20-2 (9-1 SEC) with a three-set victory against the Vol-unteers (25-13, 25-21, 25-15) on Sunday. 
Florida hit .500 with only three 
errors to quickly take the first set, but Tennessee responded with a second-set rally. 
The Gators struggled — hitting 
nearly .200 lower than the first set — allowing the Volunteers to gain momentum. Senior outside hitter Whitney Heeres led the charge with four kills in the set.
“I thought the second set was 
pretty good volleyball by both teams,” Wise said. “I think we got better from that.”
Florida’s defense continued to 
be a vital part of its success. UF held UT to a .108 hitting percent-age after shutting down Auburn on Friday.
The middle blockers and defen-
sive specialists showed off their ability, holding every Tennessee player to a hitting percentage of .300 or less. Two players hit in the negatives.
After failing to win the second 
set, the Volunteers hit .030 for the rest of the match.
“We kind of let off the gas 
pedal a little bit in the second set,” Unroe said.  “They blocked some balls, and it felt like we were coasting a little bit.”
Outside hitter Ziva Recek 
helped steady Florida’s offensive attack and made sure there would be no upset in Gainesville. 
The sophomore has struggled 
to make the same type of impact she had during her freshman year, but she made her presence known against the Volunteers. 
Recek led the team with 14 
kills and had a hitting percentage of .323.  She also notched six digs and committed just four attack er-rors. 
“It always helps us when Ziva 
plays well,” Unroe said. “When she’s on, it makes it a lot easier.  We don’t have to force as many balls out of system to Alex (Hol-ston) or the outside.” 
The Gators also received key 
contributions from sophomore outside hitter Gabby Mallette, who was instrumental on offense and defense.
She helped keep several rallies 
alive, wearing down a Tennessee defense that entered the match ranked second in the nation in digs per set (18.9) in the process.
Mallette led the team in hit-
ting percentage (.444) and tied for second with nine kills during the match. 
“They’re a team that histori-
cally plays very well here in the  O’Dome,” Wise said.  
“It wasn’t until we got into 
some good serving runs and got the ball away from their middles that allowed us to run points.”

Kourtney Keegan had two chances to advance to tour-
nament finals at the USTA Clay Court Invitational in Or-
lando this weekend.
The freshman failed each time.Keegan, a Roswell, Ga., native, fell in straight sets dur-
ing the singles semifinals. 
She then teamed up with fellow freshman Stefani Stojic 
and lost in the doubles semifinals 8-4.
On Thursday, Stojic was the only one of Florida’s three 
freshmen participating who competed in the first round, as both Keegan and Belinda Woolcock received byes. 
Stojic defeated Auburn’s Ashley Kitchen in three sets   
4-6, 7-5, 6-2 to advance to the second round. 
There, Stojic faced USTA’s Mia Hor-
vit, winning 7-6 (3), 6-1. 
Woolcock won the first set of her 
match against Tulsa’s Marcelina Cichon 
6-2 before Cichon retired. Keegan’s second-round oppo-nent withdrew due to injury.
On Friday, Keegan defeated top-seeded  Pleun Burg-
mans, a sophomore from Auburn, and Texas Tech’s Lynn Kiro, which advanced her to the semifinals of the singles tournament.
Stojic lost her singles match, and Woolcock fell in the 
quarterfinals.
“The highlight for [Friday] was obviously Kourtney 
beating the No. 1 seed,” associate coach Dave Balogh said in a release. 
“She played tough, smart and handled some pressure 
situations extremely well.”
Florida had no participants remaining in the tourna-
ment after Saturday.
The duo of Stojic and Keegan won their first match 
against Ines Deheza and Paula Deheza of Texas A&M, but they later fell against Vanderbilt’s Ashleigh Antal and Ma-rie Casares in the semifinals. 
On the singles court, Keegan fell to her opponent, US-
TA’s Peggy Porter, 6-2, 6-1. 
Next, the Gators will be split between two separate 
tournaments. The first will be held in Flushing, N.Y. The USTA/ITA National Indoor Championships will most likely feature Alex Cercone and Brianna Morgan, who are both waiting on an invitation to tournament. 
The rest of the Gators will compete at the Dick Vitale
