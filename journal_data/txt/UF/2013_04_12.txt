Students and faculty at Shands at UF and 
the Academic Health Center will now have 
more bars in more places.
UF Information Technology announced 
Tuesday that installation of the distributed antenna system is underway for Shands at UF and the Academic Health Center. The system was installed in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium last Fall.Nine buildings are included in the proj-
ect. Shands at UF General Services Building, Shands at UF Main Building, Shands Cancer Hospital, the Human Development Building, the Academic Research Building, Stetson Med-ical Science Building, the Biomedical Sciences Building, the Basic Sciences Building and the Dental Science Building should see improved cell phone reception by Oct. 1.
Additional buildings at Shands and the 
Academic Health Center are in the design pro-cess and are expected to be completed by the end of this year.
UFIT Communications Manager Tracy 
Gale said cell phone strength is important for families with patients at Shands. 
“The services from Shands and the aca-
demic science center really impact lives,” she said.
Gale explained that designing an infra-
structure to support cell phone coverage car-riers like AT&T, Verizon and Sprint, which have different operating systems, can take months to ﬁ  nish. She said once installation is complete, it takes two to three months to per-fect signal coverage.
Other areas on campus are getting a wire-
less facelift as well. UFIT Telecommunica-tions Director John Madey said the Stephen C. O’Connell Center’s distributed antenna sys-tem is part of the center’s renovation and ex-pansion project. There are 32 other buildings on campus, including the Reitz Union and the libraries, that are in the design phase for an an-tenna system.

Gov. Rick Scott signed a law Wednesday that 
bans Internet cafes across the state, but local ofﬁ  -
cials say the impacts on Gainesville are uncertain.
The bill passed in the Florida Senate last week 
with a vote of 36-4.
Mayor Craig Lowe said the objective to stop 
gambling coincides with the city’s agenda.
“Due to the various associated problems with 
these establishments, including crime and distur-bance in neighborhoods … it is something that the City of Gainesville has been advocating for,” he said.
 Art Forgey, spokesman for the Alachua County 
Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce, said ASO received a copy of the signed law Wednesday morning. He said legal ad-visers are analyzing it to calculate the ramiﬁ  cations for Gainesville.
“We’re kind of at a standstill on it,” Forgey said. 
“They’re reviewing it to see what action we’ll take and how it affects us.”
Because most of the county’s Internet cafes are 
within city limits, he said, Gainesville Police will be more involved in implementing the law.Local Internet

A new strain of the norovirus 
stomach bug may have buzzed its 
way to Gainesville.
Although no laboratory test-
ing has conﬁ  rmed the virus in the city, an outbreak at the Atrium at Gainesville Independent Senior Living Community last week led ofﬁ  cials from the Alachua County Health Department to believe it’s the norovirus, according to pub-lished reports.
The virus usually causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhea for between about 24 to 48 hours, but symptoms could last up to a week, said Nadia Kovacevich, an epidemiologist at the Alachua County Health Depart-ment. The virus is also highly con-tagious and easily spread through contaminated feces or vomit, ac-cording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Kovacevich said residents who 
may have the virus need to wash their hands and surfaces they touch.
“You pick up the virus from 
a door handle or contaminated surface. You ingest it, and it’ll go straight through your system,” she said.
Catherine Seemann, market-
ing coordinator for the UF Student Health Care Center, couldn’t con-ﬁ  rm Thursday if the SHCC has seen any cases similar to the virus at the retirement home.
She said if students are feeling 
sick, they need to stay hydrated, get plenty of rest and stay away from caffeine and alcohol.
“We always let students know if 
you ever feel that something is not right, please call us, and come in,” she said.

Mark-Jason White often 
spends about six hours a week 
calculating 101 Downtown’s liquor inventory.
White, manager at 101 
Downtown, said he has to cal-culate all the liquor inside their bottles from various bars in-side the establishment and put the information into a spread-sheet.
But Nikhil Kundra has a 
way he could shorten that time just by tapping on his phone.
Kundra is a 23-year-old UF 
alumnus and the CEO and founder of Partender, a soft-ware tool that can be used on iOS and Androids to shorten bar inventory time.
To use Partender, users tap 
on the on-screen picture of a specific liquor bottle to show the level of liquor that is inside the bottle.
“It’s a good product,” 
White said. “I just want to get my hands on it.”
Partender is now part of 
the Cade Museum’s final four, which places Kundra’s proj-ect in the running to receive a $50,000 prize.
For the past four years, the 
Cade Museum Prize competi-tion has encouraged inventors and entrepreneurs. The prize is named in honor of inventor Dr. J. Robert Cade, who led the team that created Gatorade.
Green Liquid Gas and Tech-
nologies, another local com-pany, is also in the running for the prize with a machine that converts waste into energy.
Norbert Richter, CEO of Green Liquid Gas and Tech-nologies, said 31 million tons of plastic end up in landfills each year.
“We are reducing the pres-
sure on our consumption of oil because we are reusing what already exists,” he said.
Richard Miles, board vice 
president of the Cade Mu-seum, said the museum re-ceived about 80 applications this year.
Judges selected applicants 
based on their inventions’ de-gree of innovation, the breadth of impact and how close the in-vention was to market success.
The final four teams will 
make live pitches to a new panel of judges and present at the gala event May 9 at the Santa Fe College Fine Arts Hall. The prize winner will be announced at the event.
“We’re really excited to be 
in the Cade prize because our dream is to solve real world problems,” Kundra said.

Outside of UF’s Library West, the 
air smelled strongly of confection. 
Spread across three tables, the submis-sions for the George A. Smathers Li-braries’ Edible Book Contest lay wait-ing for judgment, drawing the noses of interested bystanders.
The contest had two rules: The sub-
mission must be edible and somehow related to a book.
Contestants took advantage with 
their creative freedom. One submis-sion depicted the cover of “Watership Down” using only spices. Another suspended a portrait of a man in a glass pitcher of water, depicting “The Picture of Dorian Gray.”For the past seven years, the librar-
ies have hosted the contest in celebra-tion of National Library Week, usually drawing about 30 to 50 contestants. This year, however, the contest saw fewer submissions.
“This year, we have 14. And we 
don’t know why,” said Christine Yip, staff member at Marston Science Li-brary and head of the contest. “But we get really great entries every year.”
People walking by were asked to 
vote. Daniel Milstein, an 18-year-old UF economics and political science freshman, was impressed by all of them.
“It was a very tough decision,” he 
said. “You can tell everyone put in a lot of work in making the best design.”
In the end, Deborah Kellermann, 
a teacher at UF’s English Language Institute, and her Reading and Writ-ing Level 50 class won best overall for their version of “The Wizard of Oz.”Smathers Libraries hosts

The Florida Quidditch team will pick up 
its broomsticks this weekend to compete in 
the International Quidditch Association’s sixth annual World Cup.
The team plays the Muggle version 
of Quidditch, the magical game made popular by J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter book series, with dodgeballs, volleyballs and PVC pipes.
“As Quidditch goes, it gets more and 
more sporty,” said Emily Troilo, a 21-year-old UF English junior and the team’s vice president. “But as it continues, the [Harry Potter] culture grows.”
And the culture will continue to grow at 
the World Cup on Saturday and Sunday at Austin-Tindall Park in Kissimmee.
Eighty teams from 22 states and four 
countries, including the United States, Mexico, Canada and France, will compete, said Alex Benepe, commissioner and chairman of the International Quidditch Association.
Seven players from each team compete 
at a time — three chasers, two beaters, one keeper and one seeker, and the games at the World Cup will be played on Muggle-designed equipment, including brooms instead of the team’s PVC pipes, Troilo said.
Because the Florida Quidditch team 
placed third out of 14 teams during regionals, the team — of 21 rostered players — is ranked Division 1.  
On the first day, the team plays four 
schools. If it advances to the second day, it  could play up to 10 games.
“Day two is going to be harder for 
everyone,” said Tim Derrick, a 20-year-old 
UF classics junior and one of the team’s non-player coaches. “But I’m feeling extremely confident — this is one of the best teams in Florida.”
Team President Zach Thorne couldn’t 
agree more.
“Although there’s a nervousness, it’s 
the good kind. It’s an electric atmosphere. 
You can’t beat it,” said the 21-year-old UF classical studies junior. “This team, we didn’t have much cohesion before, but we’re like family now.”

A local nonprofit asks residents to 
help clean up Gainesville’s best-known 
creek this weekend.
Current Problems Inc. will host 
a public cleanup of Hogtown Creek starting at 9 a.m. Saturday, said Fritzi Olson, executive director of the orga-nization.
The event, which will run until 
about noon, will be behind Lowe’s AT  2564 NW 13th St.
Olson said she expects between 10 
and 20 volunteers to attend.
Volunteers at the event will remove 
trash from the creek, Olson said.Most of the pollution found in 
Hogtown Creek and other local creeks comes from storm water, she said.
“People throw stuff on the ground, 
and when it rains, it all ends up in one creek or another,” Olson said.
Saturday will be the second public 
cleanup day as part of Current Prob-lems’ two-month effort to clean up the creek. 
“We’re focusing on Hogtown be-
cause it’s the best-known waterway in Gainesville,” Olson said. “It’s a good illustration of how water in our creeks ends up in the aquifer.”
Neil Soule, a 23-year-old UF geo-
matics senior, said he spent much of his childhood playing in the local creeks.
“Our creeks are very polluted, and 
in a sense, underappreciated,” he said. “There’s definitely more we could do as a community to improve them.”Nonprofit to host second 
Hogtown Creek cleanupMore signal strength to come in Fall
The first distributed antenna system was in-
stalled with 270 antennas in place at the stadium 
in time for UF’s first home game, Madey said. These 3- to 4-inch antennas are placed between crevices and under stadium seats to maximize the volume of calls.
“When the original DAS for The Swamp was 
completed last summer, you don’t really know how good the coverage is until you get 80,000 people in there,” Gale said.
Students can expect to have more signal 
strength in the stadium next football season.
Verizon is updating its system infrastructure 
so its services can be added to the system already in the stadium. AT&T is also adding 4G, or LTE, coverage this summer.
“Whoever your provider is, next Fall, when 
you send pictures from The Swamp, chances are you’re going to have a really easy time with it,” Gale said.

GPD will visit local businesses
GPD Spokesman Officer 
Ben Tobias said after GPD le-
gal advisers review the bill, the next step may be to reach out to Internet cafe owners.
“Once we figure out the in-
tent of it, we’re going to be visit-ing the businesses that may fall under this and do some educa-tion with them,” he said.
Tobias added the response 
would resemble how GPD en-forced Attorney General Pam Bondi’s emergency ban on spice and synthetic cannabis last year.
“From what we understand 
preliminarily, it’s going to be a complete shutdown,” he said.
Meanwhile, Tobias said, 
GPD officers have been work-ing to locate the Internet cafes in the city limits and figure out which ones are still operating and which ones have closed.
“We’ve noticed a lot of these 
places have already closed on their own,” he said. “From what we understand, it was in anticipation of the bill being signed.”

Radical Press Coffee Collective will host its grand 
opening from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. tonight.
Emily Sparr, a worker and owner of the shop, said 
she was thankful for the community’s help in shop’s 
opening.
“[The seven months] went surprisingly smooth-
ly,” she said. “People donated money and items, and we couldn’t have done it without the support of Gainesville.”
The shop raised about $2,900 to open inside the Civic Media Center, 433 S. Main St. It will offer locally roast-ed coffee, shop-made sodas, local vegan baked goods and herbal teas.  
Seven workers will work 15 to 20 hours each week, 
said Rusty Poulette, a worker and owner of the shop.
The shop runs as an anti-profit operation, which 
means all surplus money will be donated back to the community, Poulette said. It is also a worker-run collec-tive, where each worker is equally paid, and decisions are made by a unanimous vote.
“I feel like I have a lot of control in the business and 
what goes on,” Poulette said. “So that feels really free-ing. I don’t have anyone telling me what to do.” Radical Press Coffee Collective opensLOCALVICTORIA CAPPELLI

CourseSmart, a company owned 
by five publishers including Pearson 
and McGraw-Hill, is testing technol-ogy that allows professors to monitor when students read their digital text-books, how often they read them and for how long.
The technology is being tested at 
Texas A&M University-San Antontio, Clemson University and the Universi-ty of Buffalo, among others, according to the CourseSmart website.
The company compiles for pro-
fessors data that contains informa-tion that correlates students’ reading habits with their success in the class. CourseSmart plans to introduce this program nationwide on a larger scale in the Fall.
Alessandra LiCalzi, a UF adjunct 
lecturer of Italian, said she would “ab-solutely” be interested in using a pro-gram like this.
“It’s something secure that I can 
track [students’] progress with,” she said. “I want them to learn. That’s the top priority.”
However, LiCalzi said, as long as 
her students are handing in work and getting good grades, it doesn’t matter to her if they read the textbook.
“What can you do? You cannot 
force them to read,” she said.Although CourseSmart may be 
beneficial to professors, Eliona Jankul-la said she doesn’t think CourseSmart would cause students to put any more effort into reading.
“I feel like there are ways to get 
around it,” said the 19-year-old UF political science sophomore. “If you just opened it up on your computer without reading, it would show the same thing.”
Victoria Sanchez, a 20-year-old UF 
industrial and systems engineering sophomore, said she doesn’t think this program will be popular among col-leges.New program tracks textbook reading

Last week, students 
walked out of Professor Bill 
Rossi’s Creativity and In-novation in the Business Environment classes with a mission. They had one week to create a plan that would raise money for a charity and were given an envelope with a mystery amount of funds.
Rossi said one class’ do-
nations were going toward Stop Children’s Cancer, and the other class’ was going to-ward Tyler’s Hope, an orga-nization committed to fund-ing research for Dystonia, a neurological movement disorder.
“There’s a lot for them 
to learn here, not the least of which is the full notion of giving back,” Rossi said.The class that will donate 
to Tyler’s Hope has already raised about $1,000. One of the teams from that class has partnered with Shuck, a new raw bar and seafood restau-rant in Midtown, to raise money for Tyler’s Hope.
Shuck, 1643 NW 1st Ave, 
is charging a $5 cover charge at the door from 9 p.m. to 2 a.m. today. All proceeds go to the charity.  Sony will give away promotional items, said William Stevens.
“We wanted to raise the 
most amount of money we could,” said the 22-year-old UF marketing senior. “We thought that since [Shuck] is a new place just opening, they want to get promotion out for themselves.”
Other teams from the 
class have showed support for this event.
“One group is creat-
ing the Facebook, and one group is doing promotional things in order to get the word out,” Stevens said.UF students host

What to expect when expecting Lochte
Ryan Lochte is the man with his gold medals and gold 
abs. The gold medals are locked up in a safe, but the abs are up for grabs — almost close enough to 
touch.
He makes me proud to be an American and proud to be 
a Gator.  
Ryan Lochte’s new reality TV show, “What Would Ryan 
Lochte Do?” will premiere on E! this month. The four-and-half minute teaser gives us a glimpse of what some of us in Gainesville may have seen, or may have missed out on if he dumped you too soon. Just kidding. It’s censored.
He’s a free-spirited athlete who loves swimming, family, 
fashion, drinking and women — not sure in which order.
He’s also an inventor. There’s one more word in the 
English language: Jeah. Be careful with the pronunciation, it’s jeeeeh-uh: emphasis on the “j” and the “e.” In August, he trademarked the phrase.
The ﬁ  ling shows he hopes to put the word on items such 
as goggles, sunglasses, jewelry and beer mugs.
I wonder if this catchphrase catches on.Lucky Lochte frequents Gainesville bars and clubs in 
search of hookups and girlfriends, whichever happens ﬁ  rst. As smooth and bro-tastic as possible, he asks female club-goers — our female classmates — on dates.
Note to Gainesville women: If you want to hook up with 
him or want 15 minutes of fame, straighten your hair and go out. The more you go, the more likely you’ll see him, and the more likely he’ll see you. I recommend you wear the Lochte shoes by Nike to stand out and impress him.
In the teaser, he asks a blond woman on a date. She plays 
hard to get by saying “maybe” and asks him to cook for her.
He says what’s on his mind. “Hell no” is he going to 
cook for her.
I’m pretty sure her answer was yes. She is just camera 
shy.  
Ryan Lochte reafﬁ  rms UF’s great party school mix with 
athletics.
His behavior on the show implies the UF female popu-
lation is easy to woo and please. I hope he doesn’t get too caught up with the show, cause a disruption to his swimming and tarnish UF’s reputation.  
To the naïve or hopeful 
women, Ryan Lochte admits he isn’t looking for a serious rela-tionship. But if you’re willing to stick around while he prac-tices for the 2016 Rio Olympics, he wants an independent girl 
who won’t rely on him for everything. She should always put a smile on his face and make him happy.
Note: He loves it when you compliment his smile. You’ll 
get free dinner. It might be at Dragonﬂ  y.
If you’re patient and can wait for his “player” phase to 
go away, then go ahead. 
In the meantime, you can stare at him in awe bartending 
at Grog House Bar & Grill on a Friday night wearing a “YES IT’S ME” shirt. 
He’s very humble.  Ryan Lochte can use the show as an opportunity to once 
and for all clear up his mom’s statement.
She admitted that her precious 28-year-old Olympian 
son “goes out on one-night-stands. He’s not able to give fully to a relationship because he’s always on the go.”
He’s in Gainesville, and he’s here to stay. I don’t see 
what the problem is.
Maybe he’s too sexy and too famous to avoid one night 
stands. With international fame and the love for a fellow Gator who has done great things for America and the Gator nation, how can one resist? The temptation of a college hookup is on West University Avenue, where he is seen taking shots at 101 Cantina and meeting women.  
The point of the matter is, he is popular, hot, straight and 
enjoys time with women.
By the 2016 Olympics, the Gainesville gem will have 
given every Gator female a chance. It’s up to you. Are you ditching the books for one night of abs?

There comes a time in all musicians’ lives, we’re assum-
ing, when they ask themselves, “Am I still relevant?” That’s the only explanation for Brad Paisley’s new 
song, which features LL Cool J, titled “Accidental Racist.” 
“We ought to try to understand people different from us,” 
wrote Time’s James Poniewozik. “Country star and hip-hop star, trading lyrics and sharing billing for peace. Don’t pre-judge! Don’t assume the worst of people! What’s not to like? Oh God, so much.” It’s an awful song, you guys, even though it sort of tried really hard to be a good-hearted one. We give a yes-we-remember-Franklin-Bluth’s-musical-career-too DART to Paisley/Cool J. Next time, don’t be so terrible.
Remember Octomom? Yeah, we’ve been trying to forget 
about her, too. But this time, we agree with her opinion on something, so we thought we’d share it with you. Recently, InTouch magazine had her pose in outﬁ  ts similar to Ange-lina Jolie’s, but she doesn’t see the similarity. “I get that we both have a lot of kids, but I don’t think I look anything like her,” said Nadya Suleman, aka Octomom, according to the Christian Post. We give a neither-of-you-should-probably-be-responsible-for-that-many-children-but-at-least-one-of-you-can-actually-afford-it LAUREL to Octomom.
Who here has felt well after putting Taco Bell into their 
body? Let’s see a show of hands. No one? That’s what we thought. We’re not knocking the founder of “fourthmeal,” but at some point, we have to realize eating weird amounts of shoddily put together food isn’t good for us. (Don’t get us started on Checkers or its self-esteemless motto: “You gotta eat!” It’s like the company knows we only eat Checkers when there are literally no other options. Anyway.) “Our customer tastes and needs are evolving,” said Greg Creed, Taco Bell CEO, according to an article written by USA Today. “They want more balanced options.” We never didn’t want that, sir. That is, to say, we’ve always wanted balanced options. Fast-food restaurants just haven’t provided them, and now we’re wise to it. We give a scratch-our-backs-and-we’ll-be-happy-to-scratch-yours DART to Taco Bell.
If you don’t have a pact with your best friend about 
what’ll happen to your computer when you die, then you don’t have a very good best friend. Everyone’s top concern is basically making sure nothing embarrassing will be left behind. Well, your buddy ol’ pal Google has you covered. Sort of. “Not many of us like thinking about death — espe-cially our own,” wrote Google’s product manager, Andrew Tuerk, in a statement on the company’s blog this week. “But making plans for what happens after you’re gone is really important for the people you leave behind. So today, we’re launching a new feature that makes it easy to tell Google what you want done with your digital assets when you die or can no longer use your account.” Uh. Great? We give a stop-being-so-creepy-pretty-please-also-maybe-thank-you LAUREL to Google.
That’s all for this week, you guys! Have a safe weekend, 
and go Gators!

Blue trees will be gone soon
I saw your article regarding the blue trees 
on the UF campus. The purpose of painting the 
trees blue is to bring attention to deforestation. However, the blue trees near the Reitz Union will be destroyed when the expansion of the Reitz begins. How ironic! Well then, there is the issue of the trees being destroyed near the corner of University Avenue and Southwest 13th Street to make way for the expanded business school. Maybe the UF Foundation needs to pick a better way to spend $22,000 that only brings attention to the university’s lack of concern for trees.

           Senate works together to pass measure
If there’s one lesson I learned this week, it’s 
that hard work can make anything possible.
Despite being the minority party with a 
quarter of the seats in the Student Senate, the Students Party was able to accomplish a key part of its Spring platform this week. The leg-islation passed at Tuesday’s Senate meeting will increase the availability of power outlets in the Marston Science Library in an innova-tive way that costs just 5 cents per student.
I am so proud of my colleague, Students 
Party Sen. John Bryan, who spearheaded this project. After significant planning, John reached out across the aisle to Sen. Ryan Barows and secured a unanimous vote for this new initiative.Students will now be able to check out por-
table outlets they can plug their laptops into without the hassle of finding a wall outlet. Fifteen of the portable chargers will be avail-able by finals week, which will greatly help students as they use their laptops to prepare for exams.
This initiative began when everyday stu-
dents told members of the Students Party that they were frustrated about the lack of charg-ing space in Marston. By working across the aisle and refusing to take no for an answer, Bryan and other leaders found a common-sense, low-cost solution to improve student life on campus.
While this is only one small part of what 
can be achieved by UF students working to-gether, it shows that even when the odds are against you, great things can be accomplished with dedication and hard work.
I hope this story inspires you to get in-
volved with improving our campus, espe-cially through Student Government and other opportunities for leadership. The Student Senate meets every at 7:30 p.m. Tuesdays in Reitz Union, Room 282. If you want to make an impact on this campus — even if you never thought about getting involved in student pol-itics — I hope you come out and join these and other efforts to move our campus forward. I look forward to meeting you there!

Letters to the Editor
Controversy concerning Section 735 of the Agricultural Appropriations Bill, also 
known as the Monsanto Protection Act, which was signed into law by President Ba-rack Obama, has been somewhat overlooked during the Supreme Court of the Unit-
ed States’ review of the Defense of Marriage Act. However, environmentalists are no less hesitant to espouse their anti-science, interventionist stance concerning genetically modified organisms, also known as GMOs. 
It may be counterintuitive, but the left-leaning environmentalist movement is en-
gaged in a war that is as equally anti-science and anti-man as the far right. Instead of 
politicizing pressing issues, both sides of the aisle evoke a moralization of these issues coupled with a holier-than-thou disposition.
Comparable hypocrisy aside, science, GMOs and fossil fuels are saving humanity and 
the environment.
Anti-GMO advocates occupy the position that GM foods are unsafe and, therefore, 
disapprove of the Monsanto Protection Act provision that GM foods are immune from litigation despite possible health risks that GMOs may pose in the future. Some anti-GMO advocates actually call for a complete ban of GM foods.
This is the most anti-humanitarian position one can take because there are no studies 
that have proven long-term negative health effects in humans related to GMO consump-tion and GM food such as “golden rice,” the brainchild of legendary plant breeder Peter Jennings, are substantially more nutritious than its non-GM contemporaries.
According to an episode of NPR’s “Morning Edition,” “Millions of people in Asia and 
Africa don’t get enough of this vital nutrient, so this rice has become the symbol of an idea: that genetically engineered crops can be a tool to improve the lives of the poor.”
Single servings of GM rice can supply a child with 60 per-
cent of his or her daily vitamin A intake, an attribute organic 
and non-GM rice lack.
GM foods also make it possible to grow more food on less acreage, and the same can 
be said for fossil fuels — another enemy of the environmentalist movement.  
According to a 2008 study in “Nature Geoscience,” crops grown using fertilizers that 
use synthetic nitrogen produced from fossil fuels fed 48 percent of the world’s popula-tion. 
In addition to fossil fuels aiding the production of food, they have also impeded on 
man’s environmental footprint by battling deforestation and cropland conversion, thus preserving biodiversity.
Absent fossil fuels and GMOs, cropland would need to increase up to 150 percent to 
feed mankind when habitat conversion is already the greatest threat to biodiversity.
The environmentalist movement is greener-than-thou just as the far right is holier-
than-thou. Although the right is preoccupied with the notion that the unborn hold more prestige than an adult woman or someone with HIV, the left is concerned with the sanc-tity of foods.
Anti-GMO activists should recognize their hypocrisy and/or find peaceful common 
ground with their anti-science, anti-human progress, far-right counterparts.

Vulnerability can be a strength.
For Laura Kalt, an Alachua Coun-
ty victim advocate counselor, sharing in the struggles and sorrows of others is a way of life.
Because of her dedication to the 
Christian Aguilar case during the fall, she will be presented with the “Vic-tim Advocate of the Year Award” April 24 by the Office of the Attorney General in Tallahassee.
Carlos Aguilar, Christian Agui-
lar’s father, expressed his apprecia-tion for Kalt’s commitment.
“We’ve been touched and blessed 
by such wonderful professionals,” he said. “They became part of the search and the efforts, and they continue to support us even now.”
Kalt became involved with the 
case Sept. 24, three days after Chris-tian Aguilar, an 18-year-old UF bio-medical engineering freshman, was reported missing.
For the next few weeks, Kalt 
helped coordinate volunteers in the search and counsel the Aguilar fam-ily.
“You really can’t say much,” she 
said. “But at least you can be there with them, so they don’t have to go through it alone.”
Kalt worked overtime to ensure 
the Aguilars and their extended family had food and housing dur-ing the search. She also distributed fliers throughout the city and spent hours with the family for any news of Christian Aguilar’s location. She said the hardest day was when Gainesville Police determined Christian Aguilar would not be found alive.
“I broke down, too,” she said. 
“You never want to hear that some-one’s never going to see their child again.”
Kalt emphasized the importance 
of establishing genuine relationships with families of victims in crises.
“We’re another human being who 
is going to accept them and be there for them,” she said.
She said the Aguilar case was spe-cial because of how it impacted her.
“The family was going through 
something so incredibly painful, but they were so dignified and solid,” she said.
She said Carlos Aguilar was the 
first person to call to congratulate her for receiving the award. She respond-ed by inviting him and other people involved in the search efforts to share in the award.
Laura Templeton, a fellow victim 
advocate with Alachua County, was impressed with Kalt’s willingness to share the award.
“Really, the Alachua County com-
munity should be honored, and that’s her stance,” Templeton said. “She’s just so willing to share ... and knows the real impact and the ripple effect in the community.”8, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, APRIL 12, 2013

About 500 people attended a daylong symposium Thursday 
for what UF President Bernie Machen called an “informed, rea-
soned and honest” discussion of land-grant universities during “Bricks and Mortar in a Digital Age: the Uncertain Future of Higher Education.”
Jeff Selingo, editor of The Chronicle of Higher Education and 
keynote speaker, spoke about the parallels between the future of higher education and the path the newspaper industry has taken throughout the years.
“It’s a story of how the traditional model becomes unsus-
tainable and becomes disrupted by new technologies and new entrance into the market,” he said.
The crashing economy means more out-of-pocket expenses 
for people who seek to enter college, and decreasing federal support for public universities means higher tuition to compen-sate, Selingo said. He called it a “perfect storm of issues affect-ing higher education.”
“Almost three-quarters of universities have flat or declining 
tuition revenue, one quarter of which are public universities,” Selingo added.
The solution, he said, could be online courses. Massive Open 
Online Courses, like those offered by Coursera and EdX, have grown quickly and offer varied paths to higher education.
“It is happening at an increasingly rapid pace, and it is em-
braced by the students,” Machen said. “The students are mov-ing that way, and faculty that are picking it up and trying it are finding that it does work.”
During a panel discussion about whether professors were 
becoming obsolete, the panelists evaluated the position of ten-ured professors in the world of massive online courses.
“One of the challenges for tenured professors is going to be 
to decide whether to engage in this challenging and frighten-ing process of relevancy,” said Kate English, a lawyer and UF alumna.
In this case, the process of relevancy involves considering 
competency-based learning, peer evaluation and computer grading, said Daphne Koller, co-founder of Coursera and the other featured speaker.
Questions at the symposium were chosen from the audience 
and from Twitter, where about 40 people actively participated in the conversation, said Teri Balser, UF dean of the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences. 
“In events like this, you can explore ideas and bring together 
people to be provocative and to ask some of the tough ques-tions,” she said. “I think it would be great if we could do it again next year.”500 attend online

Wednesday that Yeguete missed an entire week of prac-
tice leading up to the Gators’ matchup against the Ea-gles on March 29. 
Yeguete missed six games in February and returned 
to the lineup March 2. He averaged 4.5 points and 4.8 rebounds in 18.9 minutes per game during UF’s final 10 contests. 
Donovan said Yeguete would meet with team train-
ers and undergo an X-ray and MRI before opting for surgery. 
“He was able to play with his knee the way it was, so 
he’s going to have to make a decision of what he wants to do,” Donovan said.
“Can there be further repair, further help in terms of 
him getting completely healed?”
Donovan’s expectations for Young: Patric Young will 
return for the 2013-14 season, and Donovan wants the 6-foot-9, 249-pound center to take his game to the next level. 
Young, a projected second-round pick in the NBA 
Draft, announced Monday that he will stay at Florida for his senior season. 
“If you look at him when he was a sophomore, he 
averaged 10 (points) and six (rebounds). This year, he averaged 10 and six,” Donovan said.
“I really felt that Patric has the potential and ability 
to rebound more. I still think people wanted to look at his offense, that he has gotten better offensively. But I feel him playing with a consistent motor would not only help him, it would help our team. I think he has the ca-pability of doing those things.”
Young averaged 1.6 blocks and 0.9 steals in 2012-
13, but his rebounding was inconsistent. He did not record back-to-back games with at least 10 rebounds and grabbed 19 boards during a two-game stretch only once. 
Donovan believes Florida’s lack of frontcourt depth 
in practice this season stunted Young’s development.
Damontre Harris, a transfer out of South Carolina, 
suffered a labrum tear in October, causing him to miss the majority of Florida’s practices this year. The 6-foot-9 Harris also sprained his ankle during the season, keep-ing him out for a couple weeks. 
Cody Larson, a 6-foot-9 forward, left the team for 
personal reasons two weeks before the season started. 
“With Cody leaving and Damontre getting hurt, 
there really wasn’t enough size in practice and strength in practice,” Donovan said.
“This year, that should help [Young] a little more in 
practice in terms of just playing against more size, more athleticism and more shot blocking.”
Daniel Gibson and Ryan Har-
ris threw 1.1 scoreless innings in 
relief of Crawford before Johnny Magliozzi, previously announced as Saturday’s starter against the Gamecocks, came in to get the last three outs of the game.
O’Sullivan said he felt the need to use Magliozzi in the ninth because of the game’s importance but added that the sophomore right-hander would likely still make his scheduled start.
“He just wants the ball,” 
O’Sullivan said. “All the time.”

Ace has 6.10 career ERA vs. UK
hurt,” Walton said. “But I think she likes that 
pain better than she likes the pain of striking out, and letting herself down and not playing.”
Walton resting ace: After pitching Hannah Rog-
ers in Florida’s last 13 games, Walton sat the ju-nior right-hander against USF on Wednesday, despite Rogers posting a 0.68 ERA against the Bulls in four career appearances.
“We can beat anybody, but we need multiple 
pitchers,” Walton said.
“We need to give Lauren (Haeger) and we 
need to give Alyssa (Bache) an opportunity to gobble up some innings.”
Rogers will likely get back into the circle for the Gators against the Wildcats this weekend. Rogers has not fared well against Kentucky in her career. 
Rogers’ ERA against the Wildcats is an un-
characteristic 6.10. The last time Florida traveled to Lexington, she started three games in a row and gave up 24 runs during the weekend, includ-ing all 10 runs in a 10-2 loss to Kentucky on April 1, 2011. 
However, in 2012, Rogers pitched 11 innings 
versus the Wildcats and only allowed one earned run.
“Kentucky’s swinging the bat very well,” 
Walton said. “I’m going to go back and put the emphasis on out pitching and defense. We can’t give teams too many extra outs.”

With South Carolina trailing 
Florida 3-2 in the bottom of the 
ninth, Gamecocks right fielder TJ Costen rounded third and was heading home to tie the game on a hit to right field. Halfway there, Costen tripped. 
Catcher Taylor Gushue re-
ceived the throw from right field-er Cory Reid and threw Costen out at third to end the game.
“Somebody told me that he 
tripped,” Gushue said. “I didn’t know that he tripped because I was ready to tag him. When I looked up and saw he was pretty far down the line, I was just like, ‘Oh, this is pretty easy.’”
The Gators (17-18, 6-7 South-
eastern Conference) took advan-tage of several Gamecock miscues as they extended their winning streak to three games with a 3-2 win on Thursday night at McK-ethan Stadium.
A game after scoring its tying 
and winning runs against Florida State thanks to errors, Florida was helped by shoddy fielding from No. 8 South Carolina (27-8, 8-5 SEC).
Right fielder Justin Shafer and 
first baseman Vickash Ramjit reached base on back-to-back sin-gles to begin bottom of the second inning. Sophomore Josh Tobias then laid down a sacrifice bunt to advance the runners. Gamecocks third baseman George Iskenderi-an’s throw to first went into right field, which allowed Shafer to score and Ramjit to get to third.
Two batters later, designated 
hitter Mike Fahrman singled to right, scoring Ramjit to give the Gators a 2-0 lead.
“Anytime you give good 
teams more than three outs in an inning, bad things are bound to happen,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan 
said.
Florida broke a 2-2 tie in the 
bottom of the fourth with the 
help of more South Carolina fielding miscues. Vickash Ramjit reached base on a bunt single and advanced to third two batters later on a single from left fielder Harrison Bader. With Fahrman at the plate, Bader stole second, and USC catcher Grayson Grein-er’s throw was off-target, hitting USC Chase Vergason’s glove and going into right field, allowing Ramjit to score the go-ahead run.
Bader took four extra bases 
on errors that eventually led to two runs against Florida State on Tuesday. Ramjit said opposing teams can never let their guard down when Bader reaches base.
“He’s a really fast player on 
the bases,” Ramjit said of Bader. “He goes all out all the time. … I took a step to read the throw, and after I saw it (deflect) off the glove, I took off.”
UF starter Jonathon Crawford 
was impressive in a bounceback performance. In Florida’  7-3 loss at Mississippi State last Friday, Crawford lasted just five in-nings as he gave up two runs but walked five. Against the Game-cocks, Crawford gave up just two runs in 6.2 innings while striking out five. He walked two.ADAM LICHTENSTEIN

Briana Little gets on base the hard way.
The sophomore outfielder has been hit by a pitch more than 
any other softball Gator in school history. She set the record on Wednesday when UCF pitcher Sam Greiner beaned her in the bottom of the sixth.
“It feels good, because that means I’m working hard … and 
doing whatever it takes to get on,” Little said.
Francesca Enea, who was hit 15 times 
in 59 games in 2010, previously held the UF record. Little eclipsed that mark in only 38 games. But despite setting the Florida record, other batters boast more 
bruises than Little does. She ranks fourth in the nation in hit by pitches. Iowa’s Bradi Wall leads the NCAA with 21 bean balls. 
Little does not know why she has been hit so many times, 
but she was happy to continue getting on base. 
“She’s not going up there to get hit,” coach Tim Walton said. 
“She doesn’t lean into the strike zone. Those are balls that are in the batter’s box.”
Little’s 16 hit by pitches have contributed to her team-lead-
ing .492 on-base percentage. When she does get an inside pitch that stays over the plate, opposing pitchers pay. Little is second on the team in home runs and slugging percentage and third in RBI.
“She also hits home runs because people are afraid to come 
inside (because) they’re going to hit her,” Walton said.
Walton said Little’s attitude has changed from last season. 
In 2012, Little only played 35 games and started 11. She had an on-base percentage of .316 and was hit by two pitches.

Forward Will Yeguete could 
end up on the operating table 
again this summer.  
After undergoing arthroscopic 
surgery to remove bone chips in his right knee in February, Yeg-uete will strongly consider a second knee surgery during the offseason. Coach Billy Donovan called Yeguete’s first surgery a “short-term fix.”
“I don’t think anybody felt 
like the surgery was going to be this long-term solution,” Dono-van said. “So 
there are prob-ably going to be some decisions to make going forward, but I think definitely for him surgery would be on the 
table.”
Yeguete experienced swell-
ing after Florida’s 78-64 victory against Minnesota on March 24 and had his right knee drained before UF beat FGCU 62-50 in the Sweet 16. Donovan revealed Offseason surgery 
possible for forward

Senior attacker Ashley Bruns started 50 of her 51 
games at Florida before this season.
She has started only three of 15 games in 2013, but 
her impact remains unchanged.
Florida coach Amanda O’Leary has used increased 
subbing this season depending on whether the Gators 
are on offense or defense. The team runs a two-person midfield rotation, swapping in two defenders for two at-tackers and vice versa.
“We’re trying to get our best seven defenders on 
the field and seven best attackers on the field,” O’Leary said.
Senior Caroline Chesterman added: “We can talk to 
the coaches once we come off the field each time and tell them what’s working, what’s not working and then re-lay that message to the rest of the team.”
Bruns has thrived in her new role. The senior has 
scored 29 goals, which ranks third on the team.
“I actually like it a lot better because instead of waiting 
for the ball to come down, I’m on the run, moving and as a player, I personally like that better,” Bruns said.
O’Leary said the rotation keeps the Gators fast and 
fresh. 
“Ashley’s speed can catch 
teams off guard,” O’Leary said. “(She) has a good stick and can 
do good things with it.”
On the defensive end, O’Leary uses junior Krista 
Grabher, senior Colby Rhea and freshman Sydney Du-Pre as constant subs. Dupre was recently named Ameri-can Lacrosse Conference Rookie of the Week.

Taylor Burke stays busy.
After winning the wom-
en’s high jump with a 1.76m jump at the Florida Relays on April 5, she played goalie for the UF soccer team in two ex-hibition games against UCF and USF on April 7.
“It’s actually pretty easy,” 
Burke said of playing two sports.
“The high-jump coach and 
the soccer coach are really good at figuring out where I’m supposed to be and what practices I’m going to.”
This past indoor season, 
Burke broke a 21-year-old school record in the high jump at the Virginia Tech Elite Meet in Blacksburg, Va.
By clearing a height of 
1.86m, Burke surpassed for-mer Gator jumper Maria Gal-loni’s mark of 1.85m set at the 1992 Southeastern Con-ference Indoor Champion-ships.
“Taylor is a great athlete,” 
coach Mike Holloway said. 
“We knew that during the 
recruiting process. Any ath-lete that can come in and jug-gle the rigors of two different sports and college life togeth-er and be an All-American is a very special athlete.”
Burke says her track con-
ditioning also proves benefi-cial on the soccer field.
“High jump training defi-nitely helps me in soccer, like coming out for high balls,” she said.
With soccer season in the 
fall and track season in the spring, Burke’s schedule is seemingly always full. 
“In the fall, it’s soccer 
season. I go to track once a week,” Burke said.
“It’s the same thing in the 
spring. I go to track practice 
everyday  and then go to soc-cer once a 
week.”
B u r k e 
is busy for most of the year, but she does get 
a short break.
“I have a little bit of an 
offseason,” Burke said. 
“During Summer B, I train 
with soccer to get ready be-fore preseason. That’s kind of the time when it’s all con-ditioning and getting ready for the season.”
Burke won six events as 
a freshman in 2012, includ-ing a victory in the women’s high jump at the Southeast-ern Conference Outdoor Championships on May 12 in Baton Rouge, La.
Burke has three victories 
in 2013, including her high jump win at the Florida Re-lays.
