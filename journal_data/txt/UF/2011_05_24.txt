Sauce.” Homeless woman gets 35 years for fatal stabbing
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — A homeless woman has 
been sentenced to 35 years in prison for fatally stabbing an 
old woman who gave her a place to live.
A Duval County judge sentenced Melonise Alexander on 
Monday after she pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.
Authorities say 73-year-old Odessa Hunt-McCoy had be-
friended Alexander and let the younger woman stay in her home. Hunt-McCoy was found dead in February 2008, and Alexander was arrested two days later.
Prosecutors say Alexander was still in possession of Hunt-
McCoy’s jewelry, which had the victim’s blood on it.

The sound of children laughing, the 
sight of people spitting seeds and the 
smell of freshly sliced watermelon filled the air Saturday at the 66th annual New-berry Watermelon Festival.
Roughly 6,000 people attended the fes-
tival, held at Oak View Middle School in 
Newberry for the first time. 
Standing in a blue, Cinderella-style dress, 4-year-old Layla Parris, this year’s 
Watermelon Junior Queen, posed for pic-
tures with festival-goers all morning.
Excited about the large trophy she had 
won, Parris had one word for how she felt. 
“Awesome,” she said.This is her third year participating in 
the pageant.
Contests at the festival included seed 
spitting, watermelon rolling, watermelon 
eating, hog calling, best pie/cake and big-gest melon. 
Teen Queen Megan Morgan spit a wa-
termelon seed 14 feet 2 inches — a new record.
Gainesville resident Hank Hobday, 59, 
won the best cake/pie contest with his Japanese fruit pie, which was filled with raisins, coconut and pecans.
This was Hobday’s second time enter -
ing this pie into the contest, but he has par -
ticipated in several other pie contests.
“I just like doing it,” Hobday said.Jenna Garrett, 19, from Branford, Fla. 
was crowned this year’s Watermelon Queen, and she also won this year’s hog calling contest.
She stood with several contestants lin-
ing the stage and gave her best hog calls ranging from “here piggy piggy” to the traditional “sooie!”
She participated in the pageant last year 
and won second runner-up. 
Garrett, an agricultural communica-
tions major currently studying at Santa Fe College, also won second runner-up at this year’s state watermelon pageant.
“She’s not a pageant girl, she just loves 
the watermelon industry,” Garrett’s moth-er, Bobbie Jo Garrett, said.
According to organizers, the festival 
was started by the American Legion to 
help returning veterans begin promoting 
activities to help support their communi-ties.

University officials have noted 
a healthy response to this year’s 
Student Experience in the Research University survey , which is being used a second time at UF. As of Monday afternoon, more 
than 16,000 students, or 53 percent, had completed this year’s survey , according to Marie Zeglen, assis-tant provost and director of insti-tutional planning and research.  
She said this rate of response is bet-ter than all other participating uni-versities.
Zeglen said the survey was first 
used by UF in 2009 and with a par -
ticipation of 68 percent,  putting UF ahead of every other participating university that year. 
Students must complete the sur -
vey in order to register for the foot-
ball ticket lottery . 
Although students 
can register for tickets, they are not eligible in the lottery if the sur -
vey is not completed on or before June 3.
The survey , which takes about 25 minutes to complete, is designed to gather information that will be used to make changes in the university.
Zeglan said students should 
make sure they click on the submit button at the end of the survey be-cause if they don’t, it will register as incomplete.
“When I went to register for the 
lottery , I saw that I needed to do it, said Griffin Tillis, a sophomore en-gineering student,  “but I definitely wouldn’t have done it otherwise.”
Jeanna Mastrodicasa, associate 
vice president of student affairs, said it’s important that students par -
ticipate so administrators can help improve .
Mastrodicasa said the university 
did not participate in the survey last year so they could take in to account 
the results from 2009. 
She said UF is aiming for 75 per -
cent participation this year.

Ohio pair serve time in pool 
for rafting offense 
PAINESVILLE, Ohio — A 
northeast Ohio couple found them-
selves up to their ankles in trouble for rafting on a flood-swollen river without life preservers and lying 
about it afterward.
A judge sentenced them to stand 
in a tiny swimming pool while 
wearing life jackets and handing out water safety brochures Satur -
day at a festival in Painesville, 30 miles northeast of Cleveland.
Twenty-year-old Grace Nash 
and 22-year-old Bruce Crawford 
pleaded guilty to misdemeanor 
misconduct during an emergency. Searchers spent hours looking for them last month after they were spotted on the Grand River. They made it to land but lied to an offi-cial about being in the water.
They chose the pool punish-
ment and community service over 
60 days in jail.

Ohio judge gives defendants 
homework assignments
TOLEDO, Ohio — A judge 
in Ohio gives defendants what 
sounds like homework assign-ments as a part of probation sen-tences.
Lucas County Common Pleas 
Judge Stacy Cook in Toledo has or -
dered offenders to write five-page reports on topics including teen vi-olence, drug use and head injuries.
The Blade reports Cook has 
told as many as 30 people to write papers since she took the bench in 2007. She reads all of them and says it seems that the number of writers who’ve later returned to her court for serious probation violations has been low.
Lawyer Richard Hasbrook 
agrees with that assessment. He’s 
the public defender in Cook’s napped the child.
Jury selection was held in the 
Tampa Bay area because of intense 
pretrial publicity. More than 200 potential jurors were questioned, many of them excused. A juror purposely talked to a reporter in order to be dismissed, an entire panel of 50 prospects was tainted 
by a potential witness and Antho-
ny’s lead defense attorney missed a day for personal reasons.
The oddest distraction may 
have been when a woman sit-ting in the courtroom yelled: “She killed somebody, anyway” in the direction of Anthony while the judge was questioning a prospec-
tive juror.
The woman, Elizabeth Rod-
gers, was quickly escorted out by 
deputies and Judge Belvin Perry sent the potential juror to a hold-ing room.
 With tears and mascara rolling 
off her cheeks, Rodgers, 29, attrib-uted her actions to being bipolar 
and said she was on medication.
Perry held her in contempt of 
court and sentenced her to two 
days in jail. 
The trial is set to begin Tues-
day.

Pa. woman to stand trial

NEW KENSINGTON, Pa. 
— A Pennsylvania woman will 
stand trial on charges she fed marijuana-laced margarine to a 12-year-old girl she was babysit-
ting, as well as two other chil-
dren at her home.
The 12-year-old’s mother 
called Upper Burrell Town-ship police after discovering the drugs in a tub of I Can’t Be-lieve It’s Not Butter! in 22-year-old Stevie Hickey’s freezer. The woman tells police Hickey 
spread the substance on two

Police say Hickey told the

n HE’S A FORMER MINNESOTA GOV.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
DES MOINES, Iowa — Tim Pawlenty on 
Monday cast himself as the Republican candi-
date willing to tell the country hard truths as he seeks the presidency, bluntly announcing in corn-dependent Iowa that its prized federal subsidies 
for ethanol should be phased out.
The former Minnesota governor is using his 
first week of campaigning as an announced can-
didate to try to cast himself as a straight-talking Midwesterner, unafraid to consider drastic changes to sensitive spending programs in order to solve the nation’s fiscal problems. He faces several obstacles in pursuing the GOP nomina-tion; he isn’t well-known nationally , ranks low in 
popularity polling and has been tagged by come-
dians and the chattering class as boring.
Pawlenty’s announcement came hours after 
Indiana Gov . Mitch Daniels’ decision against a bid jolted the GOP race and brought the field into clearer focus.
Pawlenty made fiscal overhaul the centerpiece 
of his announcement speech, and planned to not just challenge politically influential Iowans, but swing-voting seniors in Florida and wealthy 
bank executives on Wall Street.
Pawlenty, who must win the party nomina-
tion before getting the chance to take on President 
Barack Obama, virtually ignored his GOP rivals in an announcement video, a column published in USA Today and his speech.
If he wins Iowa, Pawlenty could emerge as 
the chief rival to Mitt Romney, who lost the GOP 
nomination in 2008 and ranks 
higher in polls this year. 
Pawlenty’s Monday visit 
was his 14th to Iowa since the 
2008 election, more than any candidate except former Penn-sylvania Sen. Rick Santorum.
Pawlenty has used his vis-
its to appeal to many of the sometimes fractious segments 
of Iowa’s GOP base, seeking to compete for all parts of the party.
“He fits with the social conservatives, has the 
background of a budget cutter, and he’s strong with national security conservatives. Plus, he’s a good guy, and he’s here, working it,” said Rich-ard Schwarm, a confidant of Iowa Gov. Terry Br -
anstad and a former state GOP chairman who so far hasn’t chosen a candidate to back. Pawlenty launches bid, 
delivers tough talk in Iowa

The National Science Foundation 
has awarded a $1.8 million grant to 
UF for the renovation of its  helium 
liquefaction and recovery system. 
Neil Sullivan, a UF physics pro-
fessor and  principal investigator for the project, said the main purpose 
of the facility is to make, store and 
transport liquid helium in a system more than two miles long. The prod-uct is then used for studies, applied 
research and practical uses.
He said the renovation will im-
pact more than 100 students and 
faculty that use helium in their re-search as well as outside groups and individuals that use the facility.
The proposed installation will upgrade the current facility to sup-
port large scale users, such as the 
McKnight Brain Institute and the 
Center for Quantum Turbulence, as 
well as a variety of small interdisci-plinary projects.
The facility at UF is unique,  Sul-
livan said, in that it is able to achieve 
the lowest tem-
peratures in the 
world. He said the university has one 
of the most efficient facilities as it recovers about 95 percent of the he-
lium used.
Although the university was 
granted the award in July, the mon-
ey was finally released this month, 
Sullivan said. 
The renovations are slated to be 
finished by the end of 2013.UF gets $1.8 million

Two political newcomers official-
ly took their seats on the Gainesville 
City Commission as Susan Bottcher and Todd Chase were officially sworn in at the Thelma Boltin Senior 
Activity Center Thursday . 
Bottcher, a homemaker who 
spent years involved in commu-
nity activism before running for office this spring, replaces Warren Nielsen, who until Thursday was serving as a replacement for former commissioner Jack Donovan, who 
gave up his seat in his unsuccessful 
bid for the Alachua County Com-mission. 
Chase, a local businessman and 
former Navy pilot, defeated former city commissioner Lauren Poe in a campaign that stressed disciplined fiscal practices and “common sense leadership.”
After taking his oath on a family 
Bible, Chase told those gathered of the struggles of those living in his district. He portrayed his district, District 2, as a place where, like many others across the country , families are having trouble paying off their mortgages and business-owners are feeling crunched by the tightening economy . 
“We have tremendous opportu-
nity before us,” Chase said, “but we also have tremendous challenges.” 
Bottcher, in contrast, presented 
a more uplifting message. Hav-ing lived in Gainesville since her time as a UF student, she recalled how Gainesville was only known 
as Playboy’s “Number One Party 
School in America” when she was a student in the 1970s.
But now, Bottcher said, 
Gainesville has much more to of-fer as she rattled off rankings that praised the city for its high quality of life. 
“It’s hard not to be optimistic 
about Gainesville in the future,” she said. 
During the ceremony , the new 
commission passed its first official motion together as it unanimously appointed Commissioner Thomas Hawkins as the new mayor pro tempore. 
Hawkins was also sworn in for 
another three-year term on the city commission after winning his re-spective race in March. He said that while his new position only carries ceremonial weight — he now has the power to chair meetings and at-tend events in place of Mayor Craig Lowe — it demonstrates a level of trust from his fellow commissioners, 
which he described as “humbling.” 
“It’s a testament to the people who think I’m doing a good job,” 
he said. 
While the office of City Commis-
sion is technically a non-partisan seat, much was made about party affiliation during the campaign sea-son. Those partisan divides could be clearly seen at Thursday’s ceremony as the majority of Bottcher support-ers sat on the left side of the room 
while the bulk of Chase supporters 
sat on the right side of the room. 
Chase, who became the first Re-
publican to hold a commission seat since 2008, said party affiliations will not prohibit him from working with his fellow commissioners.

one’s name means you disregard every thought, then you’re part of the problem,” he said.By MICHAEL SYKES

Islamophobia brought Stephen Sheehi to speak at the 
Civic Media Center Saturday.
The Arabic and Arab culture professor from the Uni-
versity of South Carolina came to speak about his new 
book “Islamophobia: The Ideological Campaign Against Muslims.” 
Sheehi called Islamophobia, which he described as  an 
irrational fear or hatred of Islam and Muslims, one of the 
inherent racist tropes in America.
Event coordinator James Schmidt agreed.
“Racism is the classic American way to divide and con-
quer,” he said.  “[Racism] is a linchpin in our society, un-
fortunately.”A group of 17 showed up for the event.Lauren Byers, 19, a student at UF, heard about the 
event from a friend and attended it to learn more about 
Islamophobia.  With the conflicts in the Middle East and the United States involvement, Byers said Islamophobia is 
relevant now more than ever. 
“It’s a way for America to justify the war,” she said.
Tracy Graham, a 20-year-old UCF student, said white 
Americans don’t experience acts of hate the way other people do and that they are not affected by racism the 
way other people are.
Islamophobia, Sheehi said, is a rising example of rac-
ism in America. Anti-Muslim protests rallies and “Ameri-
can lunatics like Terry Jones” are convenient places to see 
the “hatred of brown people,” he said. 
He said Islamophobia is not seen as a larger phenome-
na but more of an extremist phenomena, which can cause 
it to be overlooked. It’s something most Americans share, he said.
Sheehi, who described himself as a “Arab-Christian-
Catholic,” said he is determined to get Americans to re-flect on their own predispositions rather than Muslim cul-ture and characteristics.
 His goal is for “white Americans” to discover why 
they have problems with Muslims. He said solving those problems is not the responsibility of the “brown people.”
“You don’t ask a Jewish person why the Holocaust 
happened,” he said.  “You don’t ask a victim for the rea-
sons they were victimized.”
Ziad Ghanimi, a spokesman for the Islamic center in 
Gainesville, said the U.S. is not at war with Islam.  Anti-
Muslim events are happening more than in the past, but 
Ghanimi said this country is not as racist as some would 
suggest.  
He said there might be areas where hatred is more com-
mon or concentrated than others, but the United States is a country of immigration and other countries are much 
worse.
“A general rule when you come to this country is that 
it doesn’t belong to any ethnic group,” he said. “It belongs 
to everyone.”4, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, MAY 24, 2011

They are young and old; stu-
dents and recent graduates; sol-
diers, mothers and even doctors.
They aren’t all clad in denim 
vests or heavy black boots, and 
they aren’t pierced in absurd plac-
es. Some don’t even have tattoos.
No one speaks of taking over 
the world or staging a government coup.
They aren’t extreme militants; 
everyone is on a first-name basis.
They’re anarchists, but you can’t 
necessarily tell.
About 25 people fill the book-
lined room at the Civic Media Center to eat, talk, discuss key is-sues and watch a film. Staying true to the anarchy theme, the group is watching “V for Vendetta,” a tale of chaos and revenge in a socially 
constrained London.
The smell of food mixes with the 
rustic aroma of beer and mead.
Sarah Cervone, founder of the 
Gainesville-based group known as 
the Anarchademics, said most peo-ple have it wrong when it comes to anarchy because of popular cul-ture.
“People should be aware that 
anarchism is as much about build-ing community and new institu-tions as it is about tearing down systems of inequality, injustice, exploitation and oppression,” Cervone said. “Those who are in power have historically promoted a caricature of anarchism as chaotic 
and violent.” 
A few minutes after the meeting 
has began, one of the Anarchadem-
ics is ready to speak out about the values of anarchy.
Her name is Caroline Williams, 
but everyone calls her Cat.
She moved from Los Angeles to 
Gainesville in 2004. She’s a 41-year-old licensed practical nurse and a self-identified anarchist.
She drinks water from a large, 
blue Clan McGilly Odin’s Ale bot-tle she got from last year’s Medi-
eval Fair and talks and laughs with 
her friend Lucinda.
It’s Lucinda’s first time at an 
Anarchademics meeting, and Wil-
liams jokes that the meeting “just might change her life.”
Williams’ tattoos aren’t visible 
when she’s fully clothed, but when tattoos are the discussion, she sweetly offers to “show-and-tell.”
Two large tattooed-wings 
spread over her upper and middle back, and she says they’re sym-bolic.
Her mother died when she was 
5. She said that’s when “the wings came about.”
“I was told she’d gone to live 
with the angels,”  Williams said, 
“and I decided to become one so I 
could be with my mom.”
Sadness fills her green eyes for 
a moment, but they brighten up 
again as she explains why she iden-tifies with anarchy.
Her delicate voice is soft, yet forceful, and her strawberry-blonde hair moves into her eyes as she speaks.
“In the U.S., it’s the red vs. the 
blue, the Democrats versus the Re-publicans,” she said. ”I just think that’s far too narrow and simplistic to define ourselves, and we need to broaden that field with discus-sion.”
Williams said she understands 
anarchy is frightening for people 
who want more government con-
trol. Yet she believes personal in-tegrity and responsibility are the only options for a civilized world.
“Some people think anarchy 
is saying ‘screw the government,’ and in a vein, it is,” she said. “But it’s also part of a viable political discourse.” 
Arne Zarzecki, a 30-year-old 
self-employed writer, craftsman and artisan, shares Williams’ senti-ments.
Zarzecki, who has identified 
with anarchist ideology his whole life, said the term “anarchy” has 
been bastardized,  scapegoated and 
at the very least misunderstood.
“Most people think of anarchy 
as something violent and chaotic 
when in reality it is about peace and empowerment,” Zarzecki said. 
Williams added, “We make 
these little boxes and expect every-
one to fit into them, but it doesn’t 
always work that way,”
Williams said anarchy is essen-
tially the free exchange of ideas 
and the freedom from intellectual 
constraint. 
“I hold the very strong convic-
tion that not only is each person capable of governing themselves, but should be responsible for do-
ing so,” she said. 
As for political freedom, Wil-
liams said she’s thankful to live in 
America where freely embracing 
and speaking about the ideals of 
anarchy isn’t illegal.
“My dream is to be the pebble 
dropped in the pond of human-ity that becomes a wave of com-passion and understanding,” she said. “I’d like to have a farm with 
a pond, where I can provide respite 
care and long-term care for veter -
ans or children who have no other place to be. I need the pond so they can go fishing and the farm so there can be food.”

Wednesday of each month from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the Civic Media 
Center.TUESDAY, MAY 24, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 5

Amanda Messer, 10, is thrown from a mechanical bull at the 66th Newberry Watermelon Festival on 
Saturday afternoon.
About 6,000 people 
attended the festival
They adopted the watermelon 
as their logo because of the fruit’s 
abundance in the region. 
“Newberry used to be the wa-
termelon capital,” said Kindra McGehee, Auction Coordinator and festival Committee Member.
Lines for some of the famous 
locally grown Newberry melons formed all day, with free water -
melon slices lying on tables just past the mechanical bull.
The festival used to be held 
at Canterbury Equestrian Show-place, but increasing costs and complaints from food vendors 
about the smell of horse manure 
forced organizers to move the event this year.
While the food and vendors 
are a big part of the festival, Tia 
Bonnell, festival president, said 
its main purpose is “community togetherness.”
“It’s clean fun, and there’s 
something for everybody,” she 
said.
This year’s festival was dedi-
cated to the memory of McGe-
hee’s mother, Joyce McKoy, who helped organize the festival for 
more than 40 years and passed 
away last spring.
A set of metal canisters paint-
ed like watermelons purchased months in advance by Joyce 
McKoy before she passed were 
auctioned and sold for $100, with proceeds going toward a festival-sponsored $1,200 scholarship offered to a local high school se-
nior.MEL oN , from page 1Jordan Streetzel / Alligator

Obama’s Israel message 
gives critics ammunition
Of all the words and phrases that have been tossed 
around by pundits and politicos in describing the Obama presidency, which have included every-
thing from Kennedy-esque to closet Quran worship, the one that never really stuck was “political miscalculation.”  While the Obama administration has been consistently hammered, fairly or not, for its stances relating to domestic 
and foreign policy, it was thought difficult, if not impos-
sible, to find a chink in the armor of its political foresight. Its ability to navigate the tides of perception and political consequence within its own base come as no surprise given the president’s education in a Cook County political system 
that forces those involved to think three steps ahead with 
one eye forward and the other peering over their shoul-ders. 
That notion was cracked last week when President 
Obama, in a move that was as spontaneous as it was politi-cally clumsy, called upon Israel to establish a two-state con-struct based on the pre-1967 borders. Such a model would force Israel to concede territory in the West Bank and Gaza. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims this 
move would leave his country in a vulnerable predica-
ment.
Whether the culprit behind such a betrayal of political 
foresight was a legitimate international concern, personal 
ambition or a desire to defy the odds — no matter how in-
surmountable and unrealistic they may be — it cannot be argued that it left a bloody scene full of fingerprints. For a president whose recent foreign policy ventures have helped beat back the perception of him as a “weak” leader, the call 
for Israel to compromise comes as a Category 5 blunder giv-
en the testy political climate that will only continue to rise with each passing month before next November. 
It’s akin to shooting oneself in the feet with a bazooka 
just after running through a garden full of rakes and having every one of them hit you in the face like Sideshow Bob.
For Obama to voluntarily jump through this trapdoor 
represents an unhealthy combination of naivete and poor political judgment. Netanyahu has shown very little signs 
that he is actually willing to negotiate with a side he views 
as nothing short of violent and hostile. It would be foolish to believe that the momentum gained from a bombing cam-paign and a dead terrorist would be enough to move this 
mountain of an issue forward. 
Still, the repercussions of this announcement of policy 
may have more effect on 2012 than the Land of the Twelve 
Tribes.  Obama’s announcement now gives the  GOP presi-dential field, one that is now playing a game of political mu-
sical chairs with too much furniture and not enough music,  
the barbed wire it needs to wrap around its economy club. 
But the greatest pain may not come in a soundbite or a 
bumper sticker slogan. The Jewish vote, once a founding 
component of the New Deal coalition and a current stable in 
the Democratic Party, cannot take much joy from Obama’s vision.  One GOP strategist on “Meet the Press” boldly pre-dicted he could get 75,000 Jewish votes out of Florida, a critical swing state from Obama’s recent statements. While such a figure may be a tad presumptuous, one cannot help 
but wonder how “two” will play into the numbers.
For Obama at this juncture, it doesn’t add up well.Screw moral feats, min-max for the win
Do you ever wake up in the morning, look in the mir -
ror and declare to the world how remarkably awe-
some you are?
For someone as ridiculously egotistical as me, the answer 
is a simple one – absolutely.
For me, the decision to verbally stroke my ego, as with 
every decision I make, requires the application of one over -
arching concept: Is the personal utility I gain from this action worth the effort it requires? How does one consistently yield the greatest personal utility while expending the least effort possible?
Simply put, I create a study guide to life.In some video games, players must train a character from 
scratch, completing quests and gaining experience in order 
to evolve into the most powerful badass possible (as badass 
as a pixelated representation of unfulfilled desires can be). 
Designers set an estimated completion time for every 
game (“X hundreds of hours for optimal gameplay”).
Yet an industry exists that attempts to smash this axiom. 
Strategy guides, FAQs and countless forums exist for the sole purpose of reducing the painful drudgery of extended video game duration. Advocates of this process refer to it as “min-maxing,” that is,  maximizing efficiency by minimizing 
wasted time and energy.
Some would argue that something is lost in rushing the 
journey . 
I think that’s complete bullshit.
In the end, the only thing that is important in life is con-
quest and domination. You may claim your experience was more holistic and meaningful because you completed some-thing the way it was “designed to be done.” But in the end we both got the job done and, in both cases, the game is back 
on the shelf collecting dust.
School is no different. Some people choose classes for 
their content, the teachers or to “broaden their horizons.” If 
I have to put in 100 hours for an A, or 2 hours for an A-, my decision is easy.But, the ultimate “min-maxer” 
must be a balanced individual. The true challenge is choosing a class that has a high enough reputation but can still be bested through efficient 
memorization and manipulation of 
information in a limited time frame, without the busy work.
A “min-maxer” cares more about 
the contents of the syllabus, then the 
contents of a class, but is still capable of cramming at the last second and getting an A.

to the castration factory.Taking notes? Naw man, I got Tutor -

10 hours in a classroom last semester, including tests. He’s currently deciding between a slew of top-tier law schools. All he does is win.
I’ll continue subscribing to my hedonism I get all the pay-
off of the Cinderella story with none of the evil stepmother shit. No need to wear glass slippers. I find plastic slippers on 
discount, manage to find a member of royalty to sleep with 
and still find time to watch a “30 Rock” marathon. All the regal sex without the curfew.
“But Shea, success is more satisfying when it comes with 
a good Christian struggle.”
Sorry, but in terms of college it’s all about the letters on 
the report card. At the end of the day, my goal is to maintain the highest GPA possible with the least amount of effort nec-essary. Combined with a healthy dose of  “college extracur -
ricular activities” (drinking and fornicating), I can graduate a true success with no regrets.

letters@alligator.orgTUESDAY, MAY 24, 2011 n  ALLIGATOR, 7
For the last month of the spring 
semester, I had the opportunity to test out the Motorola XOOM, 
Google’s tablet competitor to Apple’s iPad 2.
Full disclosure: Before I received 
the XOOM in the mail, I didn’t see how a tablet would fit into my work flow. When I’m in my dorm, in class or doing work elsewhere, I’m on my laptop. When I’m on the go, I’m on my smartphone. There’s no in-between for me.
Since seizing my free opportuni-
ty to test out a tablet, my work flow hasn’t changed, but I recognize how tablets could make a good fit for oth-ers.
Michael Murphy, a spokesperson 
for Verizon Wireless, cited QuickOf-fice and Google Docs as word process -
ing applications that make XOOM a device for presenting and producing content, the latter being a key compo -
nent for college students to consider. 
“The XOOM is a versatile device 
that allows college students access to the Internet, documents and class notes, but also provides a high-def dis-play to watch movies and play games on the go,” Murphy said. “It is a great all-in-one device for students looking for an alternative to a laptop.” 
The key reason the XOOM, or any 
tablet, doesn’t fit into my work flow is its keyboard. Its size prevents me from typing at full speed, and if I were to go out and buy an external keyboard, or even a virtual keyboard, I’d be defeat-ing the purpose of a tablet: portability. I’d prefer to use my laptop.
But once I finished all the work I 
had to do and had some leisure time, I had a hard time putting down the XOOM.
Multimedia consumption is gener -ally a plus for all tablets, and the XOOM is no different. Its 
display is phenomenal, the fact that you are holding it and can literally flip through photos still fascinates first time users, and its portability makes it great for viewing anywhere.
The amount of RAM and weight 
are a couple of notable differences between the iPad 2 and XOOM. The XOOM has twice as much RAM as the iPad 2, but is about a quarter of a pound heavier.
Also, Web browsing wasn’t as in-
stant as it seemed in commercials. But with a good wireless and 3G connec-tion, it wasn’t slow by any means. One thing I was shocked to discover was that the XOOM didn’t come ready supporting Flash, which would be a clear advantage over Apple’s prod-ucts.
The XOOM has a ton of customi-
zation options, but the interface as a whole is not nearly as intuitive as the iPad 2. Starting with the location of the power button, on the back of the device next to the camera, to the un-clear buttons along the bottom and top edges of the interface, it evokes a nerdy feel. The iPad 2’s interface is so simplistic that I’m confident even peo-ple who repel technology could oper -
ate it without any questions. I happen to prefer the XOOM’s advanced look because I enjoy figuring out what ev-ery button does and learning the best ways to operate the device. In fact, I think its advanced look and customi-zation gives it an edge over the iPad 2. But if you are looking for ease of use, I would suggest trying the iPad 2.
Lenny Neslin is a student at Quin-nipiac University.“Wait ‘til you try this. You won’t 
believe it.” 
Byers figured it was a fore-
gone conclusion I was going to swallow this shit. He knew my weaknesses.
“I don’t know Ron, LSD is an acronym. It’s 
‘Lookout Super Dope.’ You just started smok-ing pot, and already you’re screwing around with this shit.” 
“Exactly,” he said. “You turned me on 
to pot, now I’ll do you a favor. You’ll love it. Come on, it’s a beautiful day to trip. You’ll thank me for this.” 
I met Ron at Charleston Air Force Base. I 
had completed basic training and had volun-teered worldwide. With the military’s trade-mark wisdom, they sent me to South Caro-lina. 
Ron was dead-on about the beautiful day , 
so maybe he was right about this. It was May, and Charleston’s  palmettos sported the small white flowers that blossomed on their long green leaves in early summer. The Spanish 
moss hung like tinsel, and the air was thick 
with all sorts of pleasant smells.
It was a perfect day to get whacked.I examined the small orange keg. It was no 
bigger than a rice kernel. How much damage could it do? 
We dropped the barrel acid on the way 
to the diner. Shortly after breakfast, we were driving in Ron’s car, and I felt a funny flavor 
in my mouth. 
An acerbic, tart tang, like lemon drops, 
made me rub my tongue across my teeth. 
My lips reacted involuntarily and mimicked sounds crude construction workers make when a pretty girl walks by . 
I glanced at Byers. His head was inflating. 
Waves of exhilaration fluttered through my body as an effulgent smile tattooed my face. 
Moments ago, I was colorblind, but now ev-
erything was bright, crisp and clear. 
I tossed a piece of gum in my mouth. It ex-
ploded with flavors. 
“Oh my God this gum is fantastic,” I 
thought to myself. “What is this shit called? ‘Juicy Fruit’?  Do other people know about this stuff? How do they keep this on the shelves? Wait until people hear about this stuff.”
The radio knobs began to melt and dripped 
onto the floor mat. The radio dissolved com-pletely, but the music continued.  A shiver started at my heels, crept up my spine and then exploded into my brain. 
I grasped a shaky Marlboro. I brought the 
cigarette to my mouth, but my Zippo was expanding and shrinking in my hand. It was as complicated as the spaceship’s cockpit. 
I couldn’t figure out how it opened. It took 
three traffic lights to light my cigarette.
Then came the epiphany – the lunatic driv-
ing the car was as whacked as I am. Christ, ty-ing a shoelace would be complicated. 
When another rush of the acid staggers 
me, I sneaked a cautious peak over at Ron. His tongue was thrust out of his mouth like a fat, sleek seal. It belonged in a cartoon. 
“Holy shit Byers! How in the hell can you 
drive?”   
“I just follow the white line, man,” he said. 
“Wherever it goes, I go.”
This wisdom placated my twisted brain a 
moment until I turned to look out of the pas-senger window. Another vehicle was passing, but its four wheels were facing me. My head shook violently from side to side, hoping to 
correct my vision; nothing changed. The car 
lay completely on its side, yet it was zooming past me. The car’s front had passed, but the rear end lagged way behind – stretched, elon-gated, like a slinky . The hood patiently waited. Magically , the trunk scurried to catch up.  
“Byers,” I screeched, “did you see that car?” 
He laughed and 
nodded rapidly like a bobble head. 
I relaxed a moment. Then I remembered; 
he was still driving.
What little part of 
my brain still func-tioned screamed, 
“Wake up asshole! This guy has your life in his hands.”
“Byers, you can’t drive like this,” I yelled. 
“You’ve got to pull over.”   
Traffic suddenly stopped. Ahead loomed 
a bridge. The two or three cars ahead of us 
awaited the go-ahead. Swing-bridges dipped 
on pivot mechanisms to open.  
Once turned at right angles, boats cruised 
through the newly created void. The bridge turned 90 degrees instead of opening verti-cally like usual drawbridges.   
When the structure swiveled, Byers said, 
“Isn’t this acid amazing? Doesn’t it look like the bridge is rotating?” 
“Yeah, holy shit it does - unbelievable. The 
steel looks like it’s going sideways.” 
But wait a minute. If the bridge was not 
actually turning, why were all the other cars stopping?
“I got it,” said the man behind the wheel. 
“Everybody’s tripping.”  
Of course, he was right. Everybody was 
doing LSD.  What was I worried about? The 
driver had everything under control. Byers’ 
cunning analysis reassured me. I was in com-petent hands. 
After the bridge incident, Byers drove to 
what appeared to be a park, acres and acres of uninhabited land. I was besieged by massive amounts of birds: flocks and flocks of screech-ing, cawing, squawking pelicans, seagulls and pigeons. 
This was more like it. No stress. I didn’t 
want to deal with straight people. If I saw a cop, I’d collapse.  
With just a nice leisurely stroll around this 
glorious acreage, the waves of exhilaration continued, and the colors and sounds were absolutely beautiful - really gorgeous.
Suddenly the movie “Yellow Submarine” 
became clear. The colors, the swollen body 
shapes, the elongated appendages—they now 
made sense. 
Everything was exactly like that. I was liv-
ing in a cartoon. I had a new perspective. The insight the LSD implanted in my brain blew my mind, and for the first time, I recognized reality .  
I turned to Byers, “Wow man, thanks, this 
is the greatest day of my life. Really cool, and 
this place you brought me to, perfect. It’s really 
beautiful: all the wildlife, the pelicans, seagulls and pigeons. I mean really exquisite.” 
“I knew you’d love the acid,” Ron said. 
“But try and keep things in perspective. We’re in the Charleston city dump.”  But just as he spoke, a seagull rose like the phoenix from one pile of garbage and settled effortlessly on another. In majestic slow motion, the bird’s 
wings fluttered to a halt and seemed to flap 
in a magical, poetic cadence.  It was a rhythm that only a musician or spiritualist could ap-preciate. 
“Wow man, garbage dump or not, this 
place is magnificent. It’s paradise. I could stay here forever.”
Well, at least until the acid wore off, or I 
found another bridge to drive off.

This part-time, entry level position primar-
ily involves working on websites and online 
publications for our clients using HTML, CSS 
and basic image manipulation. We code web-
sites by hand (no visual website generators 
such as Frontpage), so at least entry level 
to intermediate HTML and CSS skills are re-
quired. Graphic design and layout skills may 
be helpful, but are not necessary since most 
of the work involves adding content to exist-
ing websites. About 20 hours per week with 
flexible scheduling. The position does have 
the potential for long term growth into other 
positions within our company.

n THE GATORS RETURN ALL 
27 PLAYERS ON THE ROSTER

After losing in the second round 
of the NCAA Tournament, the 
Gators didn’t have to say goodbye. 
When fifth-seeded Duke (15-
4, 4-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) 
stormed the field and claimed its 
sixth Final Four appearance with a 
13-9 win Saturday, not one of Flor -
ida’s players on the sideline lost their place next season.
For Gators coach Amanda 
O’Leary, it was just another ex-ample of what made fourth-seed-ed Florida unique this season in a sport where there are historically few surprises.
“Yes, they’re very talented, but 
their work ethic and their team chemistry are things as a coach, you 
don’t have control over. They either 
have it or they don’t,” O’Leary said. 
“This team has it and it’s such a 
pleasure. I have the best job in the world.”
Over the last 20 years, the 
NCAA Women’s Lacrosse Tourna-ment has been filled with the same, 
usual suspects, including the Blue 
Devils who have made 14 consecu-tive trips to the postseason.
In fact, since 1991 only four dif-
ferent teams have won an NCAA title, with Maryland and North-western splitting 13 champion-ships. Both teams are still alive to capture another one in this year’s 
tournament along with North Car -
olina and the Blue Devils.
“Duke is the who’s who of 
women’s lacrosse,” O’Leary said. 
“You look at their roster. They have 
Sarah Bullard who plays on the 
U.S. team, Emma Hamm and Kat Thomas. They are all top players in 
the country…They are a phenom-
enal team.”
Before the season started, the 
Gators (16-4, 5-0 American Lacrosse 
Conference) were barely a blip 
on the national radar compared 
to those vaunted programs as an 
unranked, 10-8 squad from 2010. 
Florida was picked in a preseason poll to finish fourth in the ALC and 
only had one player named to the 
all-conference team.
Yet, with a perfect home and Florida finishes sophomore season, looks to future
UF SOFTBALL

Kelsey Bruder took a first pitch off her right 
thigh and had a simple, two-word message for 
UCLA pitcher Destiny Rodino.
“That’s two,” she said, matching her words 
with her index and middle fingers as she trotted to first base.
In the grand scheme of Sunday’s Gainesville 
Regional-clinching 11-3 victory over the Bruins, it was actually six.
Six total batters were hit in the first three in-
nings of the “if necessary” Game 7, which fol-lowed a dramatic walk-off UCLA triumph. 
Three batters also were hit in Game 6, two of 
which were Bruins.
After Bruder was hit for a second time, both 
dugouts were issued a warning. Senior Aja Pac-ulba has started 262 games in her UF career, and she said she has never seen umpires have to draw the line on hit batters.
But, UF freshman Hannah Rogers, who was 
suspended earlier in the season for intentionally hitting a batter against Ole Miss, also plunked 
three UCLA players.  “I thought that it was in-
tentional,” Bruins coach Kelly Inouye-Perez 
said. “That was my stance. Because of the history of this program, [the Gators] continue to hit our 
best hitters in those situations. It’s a fact.”
The coach’s accusations were part of a wild 
Sunday afternoon that is sure to escalate the 
budding cross-country rivalry between college softball’s traditional power and one of its rising programs. Although 2,130 miles apart, the two schools are natural rivals. Six Gators are from Southern California, including freshman Chey-
enne Coyle, who grew up 
cheering for UCLA but had a 
homer and three RBIs against the Bruins on Sunday.
“This is a huge moment,” 
UF coach Tim Walton said. 
“We just played UCLA and won. I’m very proud. I know they are going to talk about the injuries and things like 
that, but I’m proud of the way we played.”
The Bruins’ injury woes were highlighted 
when backup catcher Alyssa Tiumalu injured her knee in Game 3. The Gators responded with an aggressive plan to attack UCLA third-string senior catcher Grace Murray, who had never ap-peared in a game as anything but a pinch-runner before the weekend.UCLA hot after hit batsmen

The UF women’s tennis team ad-
vanced to the NCAA Tournament final with a 4-0 win over UCLA on  Monday.
The Gators will face Stanford to-
day at 7 p.m. for the NCAA Cham-pionship, a rematch of last year’s final.
While the score made the match 
seem like a easy win, Florida again had to dig deep again in singles play, a common theme in the three matches the Gators have played in Palo Alto, Calif.
“We played our best tennis of 
the week so far [Monday],” coach Roland Thornqvist said. “We finally got off to a good start in singles and that made a big difference.”
After winning the doubles point, 
Florida got singles wins from Lau-ren Embree on Court 2, Alex Cer -
cone on Court 5 and Allie Will on 
Court 1. Each win came in straight sets.
“[Will and Embree] 
were really good to-night, we’ve relied on 
these two superstars 
all year long and to-
day was no different,” Thornqvist said. 
The win gave Florida its 30th 
win of the year, the seventh time in program history the Gators have reached that plateau.

ford is what the whole season has UF nabs finals berth,

Men’s Tennis
The UF men’s tennis team suffered a sea-
son-ending loss to Kentucky in the Round of 16 of the NCAA Tournament on Thurs-day. The No. 7-seed Gators lost 4-2 in their third meeting with the Wildcats this 
year. Florida beat Kentucky in the SEC final, but the Wildcats were the deeper team in Palo Alto, Calif., as the Gators lost 
singles matches on Courts 4, 5 and 6. Senior Alexandre Lacroix won his final singles match as a Gator. Men’s Golf
The Florida men’s golf team won the NCAA 
Southeast Florida Regional —  its fifth tour-
nament victory of the season —  over the 
weekend to advance to the championships 
in Stillwater, Okla. The Gators carded an 11-under 277 in the final round to over-take defending national champion Augusta State. Seniors Andres Echavarria and Bank 
Vongvanij carried the Gators, shooting a combined 16-under.
Women’s Tennis
Florida’s women’s tennis team fought 
off two deceivingly tough opponents to 
advance to the NCAA Tournament semi-finals for the 21st time in the last 25 years. Identical 4-1 scores against Clem-son and Miami don’t quite tell the tale, as the Gators were challenged in singles 
against both teams. Freshman Alex Cercone clinced UF’s victory over UM with a marathon three-set win.Women’s Golf
Laboring through weather delays and dif-
ficult conditions, the UF women’s golf team notched a top-10 finish at the NCAA Cham-pionships for the 18th time in the history 
of the program. Playing at the difficult Traditions Golf Club in Bryan, Texas, junior Andrea Watts finished in a tie for 15th indi-vidually at 5-over. After not qualifying last season, the Gators finished among the best 
teams in the nation this season and stand to lose just one player from the current roster.Lacroix Echavarria

been leading up to for Florida. The 
Gators have only lost two team matches in the past calendar year — both to Stanford. The first was in last year’s NCAA Tournament final, and this season’s only loss came in the final of the ITA Indoor Championships.
“Obviously we’re proud, this is 
what we’ve worked for,” Thorn-qvist said. 
“We played during this week 
with a heavy, heavy burden. We played with the whole world on 
our shoulders like we had to get 
here and anything else would be a failure.”
The No. 2-seed Gators have 
had to work on staying focused against lesser teams all season, but that won’t be a cause for concern against No. 1 seed Stanford, which has cast a shadow over the Gators 
all year.
The match will be a challenge 
for Florida, as Stanford is the only 
undefeated squad in the nation and hasn’t lost at him since 1999.
“Stanford has to be the favorite 
— they haven’t lost here in 11 or 12 years,” Thornqvist said. 
“Hopefully we’ll play our best 
tennis of the year [today].”TUESDAY, MAY 24, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 15

Gators-Bruins rivalry picks up steam after contentious weekend
Florida stole 21 bases in three games 
against the Bruins, including six in the first in-
ning of Sunday’s second game. In comparison, the Gators stole 69 bases in 56 regular season games.
“I’m not feeling sorry for anybody at this 
point of time,” Walton said. “That was a weak-ness. Every time we got on, we were steal-ing.”
Murray said she was doing her best to get 
UF runners out, although she was only suc-cessful in doing so once in 22 attempts.
Inouye-Perez said she understood Florida’s 
aggression and sarcastically congratulated UF runners for “stealing off of my bullpen catch-er.” But when UF stole two bases up 9-0 in the fourth, she changed her tone. “That says a lot about a program when you do that,” she said.
Walton said the Gators stole 
bases against the Bruins out of respect, and he scoffed at their allegations against Rogers.
“It’s UCLA for Pete’s sake,” 
he said. “She was nervous and 
she hit a few of their batters. It happens.”
UF’s coach also noted the class of his team, 
which, led by Paculba during postgame inter -views, declined to dive into the verbal cross-fire. Meanwhile, it was UCLA first baseman Andrea Harrison who may have helped fuel the matchup going forward by saying, despite the losses, the Bruins were still the better team 
“player by player.”
“I give [Rogers] credit for the job she did to-
day ,” Harrison said. “But if I faced them again, 
it’s on.”
SOFTBALL , from page 13conference record highlighted by a win over the No. 2 Wild-
cats, the Gators became the first team in NCAA history to make the postseason in their second year in existence.  
“To be in the second year of your program and to be in the 
tournament and win the first round, be in the second round and give a team…who’s been around longer at this point, the kind of game they gave us. They deserve all of the credit for that,” Duke coach Kerstin Kimel said.
Using an attractive brand of lacrosse that demanded speed 
and athleticism from all 12 of its players on the field, Florida regularly outpaced its opponents in Gainesville’s 90 degree heat, forcing them into methodical possessions and even 
stalls to catch their breath.
By the end of the season, the Gators were faster, younger 
and tanner than any of the 18 teams they had played. 
But still, youthful exuberance wasn’t a replacement for 
experience down the stretch, as Florida found out in late sea-son losses to senior-laden Cornell, Northwestern and Duke 
squads.
“Looking back on the entire season, we really made his-
tory,” Kitty Cullen said. “Once we’re older and more mature, 
we’ve had so much experience this year, we’re going to be a 
huge threat in years to come.”
 By next season, the Gators will have at least 15 juniors on 
their roster, along with a senior in midfielder Caroline Co-chran, who have all had experience as starters.
While this might seem like a wealth of depth for a team 
that is already 27 players strong, O’Leary has seven addition-
al players committed for 2012, including three in the ESPN Rise top 25.
“I expect next year, they don’t like to lose this team, so they 
will  carry this through the summer and through the fall, and 
hopefully, next spring we’ll be able to come out and compete 
against teams like this day in and day out,” O’Leary said.Experience crucial as

UF tennis coachn WIN OVER UK SECURES 
BACK-TO-BACK SEC TITLES 
JESSE SIMONTON
Alligator Staff Writer

After No. 3 Florida walloped 
Kentucky in the weekend’s series 
finale to capture a share of the 
Southeastern Conference crown, coach Kevin O’Sullivan could fi-
nally breathe easy, at least for a 
little while anyways.
“I’m looking forward to tak-
ing a deep breath tonight,” he said. “This year has been a little 
bit of a grind.”
The Gators won back-to-back 
SEC titles for just the second time 
in school history, but their season 
has been far from a cakewalk. 
Florida entered the 2011 cam-
paign as preseason favorites and the top-ranked team in the coun-
try, but as expectations swelled, so did the burden to live up to the 
lofty pressure. 
In a moment of delirium, after 
doing something no Gators team 
had done since 1981-82, UF’s manager finally admitted the 
stress of the season.
“Not a little bit actually, it’s 
been a huge grind to be honest 
with you. To go out there every night and your team is expected 
to play flawlessly. You’re not 
supposed to lose.  And to have a 
lot of expectations, and for these 
guys to respond and play the way 
they have over the course of the 
year is a huge accomplishment.”
A year after an early exit 
from the College World Series, 
the Gators returned their entire 
weekend rotation and five Fresh-
man All-Americans. They added 
a top-rated recruiting class in-cluding the number nine pick 
in Major League Baseball’s June 
Draft. 
From day one, a target has 
been on their backs. 
“It’s different from last year,” 
O’Sullivan said. “A year ago we 
had a whole lot of freshmen and not a lot was expected.”
In 2011, UF has faced growing 
expectations all year, but despite 
the pressure, the team played 
well most of the season. 
Winning a conference cham-
pionship was one of just several 
goals the Gators set before the season, but after capturing a ma-
jor accomplishment Saturday, the 
team felt relieved. 
“We don’t take these things 
for granted,” sophomore Austin 
Maddox said. “They don’t come 
around much.” 
The Gators shared the SEC ti-
tle with No. 1 South Carolina and No. 4 Vanderbilt as each team won two games over the week-
end. 
“I don’t ever remember 
this league being this tough,” 
O’Sullivan said. “You’ve got 
three teams in the East that have 
been ranked in the top five, and 
we all ended up with the same 
record and all the teams feel like they accomplished something 
this year.”
On Wednesday, the pres-
sure will be revved up again as 
Florida opens the SEC tourna-
ment against Mississippi State. 
After an intense regular season, 
senior Josh Adams was asked if 
the team will be ready for a titil-lating postseason, and the second 
baseman responded confidently, 
“We’ll see.”16, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, MAY 24, 2011
