These trees stand apart from 
the others. 
Despite being encircled in a 
jungle of smaller trees, shrubs 
and vines, about 20 pines tower over the UF Bat House Woods Conservation Area. 
But soon, nine of these de-
cades-old, almost 80-feet-tall pines will be chopped down to allow more sunlight onto the sev-enth hole of UF’s golf course in 
the winter.
One of the trees’ neighbors, 
Rod McGalliard, said he isn’t hap-
py about it. 
“These (trees) are giants,” the 
67-year-old UF alumnus said.  “You look around campus and see if you ﬁ  nd another pine tree that size.”
McGalliard and his wife, Kim 
Tanzer, live in the Golfview com-munity, which is bordered by the bat houses, conservation area and 
the UF golf course.
“If you can cut down these 
trees in the nature conservation 
area,” he said, “what else can you do to it?”
The area is supposed to be pro-tected, McGalliard said. He cited UF’s Conservation Area Land 
Management Plan, which said the 
region is to be preserved because of its “relatively undisturbed nat-ural character and its proximity to 
Lake Alice.”
On Jan. 8, Scott Hampton, Di-rector of UF Golf Courses, met 
with the UF Vegetation and Land-
scaping Committee and requested 
that some of the loblolly pines be removed. The golf course’s grass was replaced with the carpet-like 
Ultradwarf grass in the fall, which 
needs a lot of sunlight and is more susceptible to funguses than other grasses.
The committee voted unani-
mously to recommend removing the trees.
Its chair, Gail Hansen, said the 
committee’s recommendation in-
cluded using mitigation funds to 
remove invasive plants that have crept into the conservation area.
Residents from Golfview will 
also be able to suggest how miti-gation funds should be used, she said.
Only Curtis Reynolds, UF’s 
Vice President for Business Af-
fairs, can halt the tree removal 
process, Hansen said. Reynolds approved the committee’s recom-mendation March 31.
“At this point, the committee is 
not involved in it,” Hansen said.
Reynolds’ secretary said he de-
clined to comment.
McGalliard emailed his con-
cerns to Reynolds, Hampton, UF President Kent Fuchs and others involved in UF planning and rela-tions.

UF’S BOARD OF TRUSTEES 
MET FRIDAY.
By Melissa Gomez

mgomez@alligator.org
The UF Board of Trustees proposed a 10-
year development plan to the Florida Legis-
lature in hopes of receiving a $100 million grant.
Friday afternoon, the Board held a joint 
meeting with the committees on strategic initiatives and external relations to discuss the progress of the plan, which is designed to focus on expanding UF’s campus through increased student housing and bringing business opportunities for graduate stu-dents.
Phase one of the strategic development 
plan involves fact-ﬁ  nding, which is where 
metrics come in, said Charles E. Lane, the 
UF senior vice president and chief operating ofﬁ  cer.
With metrics, the board can evaluate 
where UF needs to improve and what they 
can expand, Provost Joe Glover said.
Metric rankings show the Board of Trust-
ees how UF is doing by using data points 
for progress, said Janine Sikes, UF spokes-woman.
The master plan will take about 10 years 
and will focus on the campus and its ef-fect on the community, said Lane, who an-nounced the plan’s update.
The plan is focused on UF’s relationship 
to Gainesville and how it compares to other college towns in regards to housing and transportation, Lane said.
“The campus isn’t static,” Lane said. 
“It’s dynamic.”
UF President Kent Fuchs said the plan 
allows for the board to think strategically about expansion.
“This lets us think how the city is going 
to grow with the campus,” Fuchs said. CAMPUS

U.S. Senator and presidential candi-
date Marco Rubio announced his plan for 
student-loan reform at a campaign event 
in Iowa.
The program, titled “Student Right 
to Know Before You Go Act,” requires 
colleges to inform students and parents 
about how much money students will 
make with their chosen degrees from that school before they take out loans, “so people can decide whether it’s worth borrowing tens of thousands of dollars to 
major in basket weaving,” Rubio said at 
the campaign event.Such reform will allow young Ameri-
cans to choose a major that provides them a steady job when they graduate, 
which will stimulate economic growth, Ru-bio said.  
However, the finan-
cial advising office at UF already does a lot of outreach for students, 
especially for incoming freshmen at Preview, 
said Donna Kolb, the senior associate di-rector of the office for student financial affairs.

The Rev. Marek Dzien, the pastor at St. Au-
gustine Church, started his religious journey 20 
years ago as a priest in Poland.
Back then, the 25-year-old Polish man 
would’ve never imagined that he would be 
celebrating his 20th anniversary as a priest in 
Gainesville, eating Baskin-Robbins ice cream and way too much cake.
The anniversary celebrations took place 
May 31 in the lounge of the Catholic Student Center, located on 1738 W University Ave.        Parishioners were invited to attend a recep-tion for Dzien after each mass.
“When people gather for him, to honor 
him or to do something for him, he is always surprised,” said Gail Fitzsimmons, Dzien’s administrative assistant. She said her greatest memory of Dzien is his daily humility, which can be seen every time he tells the story about his ordination to the priesthood.
When Dzien was discerning his call to 
priesthood, Poland was under communist rule. 
This meant that outside the Catholic Church, 
Dzien was not free to express his faith.
“The church in Poland in the time of com-munism was like an island of freedom,” Dzien said. “You could talk about everything, but out-
side of the church there was no free speech.”
It wasn’t until 1989, when Dzien entered 
the seminary, that Catholicism started to be-
come accepted in Poland.
After being ordained, Dzien lived in Po-
land for six years. Next, he moved to Ecuador, where he was the priest for a local church for another six years. Once his contract ended, he decided he wanted to move to the U.S.
In 2008, he began studying English at the 
University of North Florida in Jacksonville. Then, he moved to St. Augustine, where he was the associate pastor for San Sebas-tian Catholic Church. In 2012, he arrived in 
Gainesville, even though he said he wasn’t too 
thrilled to be here in the beginning.
“I came here very upset because I didn’t 
see myself working with young people,” Dzien said. “The ﬁ  rst year was hard.”
A lot has changed since he got here. Dzien 
said thanks to the students, he’s been able to open up to the community.  
“I think I speak for a lot of people here,” 
said Douglas Ghizzoni, the director of liturgy and music. “We are really blessed. ... He’s re-ally a great shepherd for this community.” St. Augustine priest celebrates 20 years of ordination4   ALLIGATOR    TUESDAY, JUNE 9, 2015
down simply by alleging that the grass 
doesn’t grow as well for three months in the wintertime because these nuisance 
trees cast a shade, I mean, I can come up 
with an excuse to cut down anything,” Mc-Galliard said.
He said he worries that the university 
will lose its Audubon Sanctuary status, 
which it earned in October 2005 for hold-ing itself to high environmental standards. 
The residents in Golfview were not 
warned that the trees would be removed, 
McGalliard said. He doesn’t think Summer 
students are aware of the university’s deci-sion either.
“It’s a quiet time,” he said. “It’s the time 
to do this stuff.”
McGalliard said it was “total serendip-
ity” that he and Tanzer saw the tree-re-moval truck with a worker in it on their morning walk.“If we hadn’t come this way, we’d have 
never seen the truck,” McGalliard said.  “I would’ve never talked to the guy (who was going to trim trees and cut the pines). … I would have never spent enough time chat-
ting with him to ﬁ  gure out what the heck he was doing.”
When the worker told McGalliard and 
Tanzer that he was cutting down some of the trees, McGalliard said he told the man 
to call his boss. The area was preserved, McGalliard said.
The truck drove away that day, but it 
will be back if Reynolds doesn’t stop the 
removal process.
“I’m worried about these trees, and I’m 
worried about this area,” McGalliard said. 
“And I’m worried about the campus.”TREE,  from pg1He fears UF could lose its Audubon Sanctuary status
represents our office at Pre-view and informs the stu-dents about all the financial 
options they have,” Kolb 
said.
Most of the time when 
students come to the office 
and ask about repaying stu-
dent loans, they’re seniors in college, Kolb said.
Some UF students agree 
that more information and 
advice before taking out a 
loan would be beneficial.
“I didn’t really receive 
any advice about taking out 
my student loan except for 
a bunch of online informa-tion,” said Andrew Rañon, 
22, a fifth-year industrial 
and systems engineering student at UF.
Like other students at 
UF, Rañon took the first two 
years of college to figure 
out his desired major. 
Once he chose a major, 
he received very limited ad-
vising on his chosen career path.
Although Rubio’s plan 
consists of college advisers 
informing students about their career decisions, high 
school advisers could also 
be a part of this process.
Instead of giving advice 
on what major to choose or 
whether a student may need 
financial assistance during college, “all the focus is on getting you out of high school,” Rañon said about 
high school counselors.
Students have to do their 
own work when picking a 
major, said 21-year-old Car-
oline Collins, a UF health 
education and behavior se-nior.
Like many other stu-
dents who switch majors 
in college, both Rañon and 
Collins recall how easy it was to change their majors at UF.
The advisers tell stu-
dents, “‘You can do what-ever you want,’ which is kind of not true,” Collins said.LOANS,  from pg1 Some UF students say more information on loans is beneicial

Alligator Contributing Writer
After nearly seven months of 
renovations, Burrito Bros. Taco 
Co. will move into its new build-
ing later this week.
Located at 1402 W. University 
Ave., the restaurant now offers an indoor dining area, a bar and 
two full patios, as well as TVs and music.
“We wanted to keep it just 
how it’s been running for the past 40 years,” said Randy Akerson, the owner of Burrito Bros. 
One of the restaurant’s biggest 
changes is its new selection of beer on tap.
There are 12 beers on tap, 
including 10 Florida beers, said 
Lauren Stucki, the restaurant’s 
general manager. 
On its opening day, the local 
restaurant will serve its full menu 
and will add some bar and late-night specials later on this sum-
mer.
Burrito Bros. will be open ev-
ery day from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m 
and is considering expanding its 
hours to 1 a.m. to cater to late-night customers.
Sharif Hosein, a 22-year-old 
UF biochemistry junior, has been 
going to Burrito Bros. since he 
started attending UF.
“Just from what I can see I 
definitely think the new outdoor 
patios will be a great place for 
people to just hang out and enjoy a couple beers and tacos,” Hosein said.
Burrito Bros. is undergoing its 
final inspections and will open on an undetermined day sometime later this week.Burrito Bros. opens new building this week after renovations

World Cup 
commences 
despite shadow 
of corruption
Despite international arrests and corruption charges 
that rocked the FIFA world last month, the Women’s World Cup commences this week with much ado. Team USA has its work cut out for it as it faced Aus-tralia, the No. 10 ranked team in the world, and later 
competes against Sweden, ranked No. 5.
You’d think the shadow of corruption following last 
month’s reports on the arrests in Zurich, Switzerland, would 
mar such proceedings, but surprisingly, both broadcast and 
print reports have been keeping news on the actual ball, which is great, actually.
“Shocking” as it was to hear that the upper echelons 
of football have been dictated and capitalized upon by a vaguely omniscient council of corruption, it’s important to remember what the World Cup should represent: a show of sporting competition and an opportunity for nations around 
the world to cheer on their favorite athletes.
Millions of dollars may have been funneled into bribes for 
votes over the years, but the people responsible are getting 
rounded up, the cup continues unabated, and, frankly, once we actually hit the ﬁ  eld, the selection process of the World 
Cup location probably doesn’t really matter to our athletes.
Big-wig FIFA executives have been acting about as das-
tardly as we’ve all expected, but Sepp Blatter’s corruption 
and South African vote bribes aren’t worth our time when 
warriors like Christie Rampone and Gator alum Abby Wam-
bach have trained and practiced for months to represent the heights of our athletic competition.
We’re not suggesting that corruption in the international 
ring is anything to sneeze at.
We’re just saying that backroom bribes and suitcases full 
of money aside, our athletes are on the ﬁ  eld and we should give them the attention they deserve.
We should be recognizing the people who actually mat-
ter, the women from literally all over the world having put their hearts, bodies and souls into the worldwide arena with a single goal.
Blatter and the others involved in the FIFA corruption 
charges will get whats coming to them, but for right now, 
lets keep the focus on the champions representing us on the 
ﬁ  eld.
Let’s keep our eye on the ball.Sports organizations need to be held 
responsible for punishing their athletes
The start of the Women’s World Cup raises new questions about the han-dling of Hope Solo’s case. Solo is the 
goalie for the U.S. Women’s National 
Soccer Team, and she has recently 
been making the rounds on national media in order to redeem herself after facing domestic 
violence charges. 
While her clubs, Seattle Reign FC and U.S. 
Soccer, have promised to investigate the charg-
es, she has not yet been suspended as the Wom-en’s World Cup, which began Saturday, gets underway. 
Even though athletes often have their violence over-
looked, their actions are a reﬂ  ection on the sport and need to be punished accordingly with suspensions. The amount of time that U.S. Soccer and Seattle Reign FC have taken for this investigation is clearly an attempt to just hope that this story dies down.
The WNBA was much more decisive and proactive 
about punishing its athletes, and it suspended both 
Brittney Griner and Glory Johnson for seven games after 
a physical altercation at their home. 
This seems more appropriate than punishments 
doled out by the NFL, despite Roger Goodell’s attempts to seem more active in combatting domestic violence 
within the NFL. 
Ray Rice’s punishment was changed by public outcry 
from a two-game suspension to an indeﬁ  nite one, and 
this spurred a change in the NFL’s rules. 
Adrian Peterson, who hit his son with a tree branch, 
was suspended indeﬁ  nitely by the NFL in order to go through treatment, which is an example of one of the harsher punishments that Goodell has tried to put into place. 
The rules about suspensions for domestic violence or sexual assault call for a six-game suspen-sion for the ﬁ  rst offense, but the suspension can be longer since Goodell is in charge of 
enforcing it.
The sports world is waking up to the ne-
cessity of harsher punishments for athletes. 
But Solo should not be the exception. Investi-
gations need to be more transparent and con-
sequences need to be put in place, even with no legal conviction. Instead of just responding   
to public outcry, they need to be more proactive.
Athletes are like any other celebrities, and of course 
they have privilege when it comes to legal prosecution, whether that means drawn-out trials or watered-down sentences. That doesn’t mean that sports can’t punish their athletes.
There needs to be more accountability about domes-
tic violence in sports across the board. Essentially, the athletes are employees, and their actions reﬂ  ect on the sport as a whole. Their talent shouldn’t make them any different from anyone else when it comes to account-
ability.

Proceeds from the event benefitted Forage Farm, a Gainesville non-profit dedicated to promoting food education.Photos by Andres LeivaTUESDAY, JUNE 9, 2015   ALLIGATOR   9 8   ALLIGATOR    TUESDAY, JUNE 9, 2015
Gainesville Throwbacks
June 9, 1987
Robert Jerry Britt Jr., a 25-year-old UF 
doctoral student, drowns off a Sarasota beach while searching for fossils for his dissertation. Kevin Churchill, the ﬁ  rst of-ﬁ  cer on the scene, said Britt did not know how to swim and somehow ended up in deep water. Britt’s distressed yelling as he drowned was mistaken for the sounds of a nearby boat. By the time people noticed his yelling and called a ﬁ  re rescue unit, he’d been unconscious under 8 feet of water for 45 minutes. 
June 10, 2013
Jury selection began for the Seminole 
County murder trial of George Zimmerman — a case that has sparked national debate.
Zimmerman, then 29, was charged with 
second-degree murder after Trayvon Mar-tin, an unarmed black teenager, was shot and killed in Sanford in February 2012. Zimmerman has pleaded not guilty, and he said he was just defending himself in a ﬁ  ght with Martin. Zimmerman was the self-appointed neighborhood watchman and called 911 several times with complaints of a suspicious black man.
June 12, 2014Local police identiﬁ  ed a UF student 
Wednesday after back-to-back public-masturbation incidents earlier in the week. Gainesville Police ﬁ  led a sworn complaint for lewd acts against 18-year-old UF stu-dent Eric Cody Moxam after a joint investi-gation with University Police, according to a UF emergency notiﬁ  cation.  
A female student called UPD on Wednes-
day after she witnessed Moxam masturbat-ing while sitting on a bench near Little Hall on Tuesday around 11:30 a.m., according to the notiﬁ  cation. Gainesville Police also responded Monday to reports of Moxam allegedly masturbating near Sorority Row.

Rosemary Hill Observatory, un-
der the UF Astronomy department, 
was ranked No. 25 in a list of the 
top 35 college observatories in the 
nation on Collegerank.net.
According to the site, Rosemary 
Hill is a strong selling point for stu-
dents looking to study stars, phys-
ics or related studies.
“It feels good, taking into ac-count several things,” said Fran-
cisco Reyes, the director of UF teaching observatories. “I’m not sure how we got ranked but they 
were the ones who took into con-
sideration everything we had in the observatory.”
The observatory, founded in 
1967, includes two telescope 
domes, a dormitory and utility 
buildings, according to UF’s as-tronomy website.
The facility’s research labs pro-vide high-tech connectivity and offer public observation and tours throughout the year.
Students get to use the facil-
ity instruments, which can be an important moment in their profes-sional life if it’s their ﬁ  rst time us-ing the equipment, Reyes said.
Although Rosemary Hill is a pri-
vate observatory, members of the Alachua County astronomy club visit the site several times through-out the year, said Andy Howell, the club president.
The strategic location of Rose-
mary Hill, 30 miles southwest of Gainesville, allows for clearer pic-
tures of the night sky free from 
light pollution.  
“It’s a useful teaching tool,” 
said R. “Deno” Stelter, a graduate student studying massive stars and 
NIR instrumentation. 
“You get very good hands-on 
experience.” UF observatory ranked among top 35 college observatories
Observatories were ranked in 
four categories, which added up 
to a total score between 0 and 100
 Number, size and technology
  of telescopes available
 Altitude
 Weather
 Light Pollution
Bonus points (between 0 and 10 points) were awarded for noteworthy aspects of the observatory.

Gator up for NCAA Woman of the Year
University of Florida lacrosse team captain Nora Barry is among 
a group of female athletes up for the 2015 NCAA Woman of the Year, the NCAA announced on Monday. The Florida men's and women's 
track and ﬁ  eld teams will be represented by 23 athletes at the NCAA Outdoor Championships on June 10-13. Read the story on page 16. When the Florida softball team was celebrating its second national title in as many seasons in Gainesville last Thurs-
day, three players addressed the fans and answered questions.
But it was the fourth player who 
unexpectedly talked to the fans that stole the show.  
After Aubree Munro ﬁ  nished 
answering questions, coach Tim Walton grabbed the microphone 
and brought up Kathlyn Medina.
It was a ﬁ  tting and emotional 
moment for Walton to call up Me-
dina, who was by far the most un-
derrated player on the team.
Walton went out of his way to 
recognize what Medina did for the 
program, and as Medina wiped away tears and shared a moment with her coach, everyone in atten-dance realized just how much she 
meant to the team. 
"It made me very emotional 
when Katie got recognized," fellow 
senior Lauren Haeger said "Just be-cause she doesn't get recognized. 
"She's so talented and I feel like 
she doesn't get enough credit." 
Adding to what Haeger said, I’m 
willing to say that Medina was the third-most important player on the team behind Haeger and Kelsey Stewart. 
In fact, she might have been the 
most important defensive player on 
the roster. 
Walton said that Medina is the 
deﬁ  nition of selﬂ  ess because she 
never complained once about not being in the lineup and only being used in the ﬁ  eld.
She simply went out there and 
did her job.
And she was the best at it in the 
country. 
Walton doesn’t deny it and it’s 
hard to argue against him.
Medina never could hit as well 
as Haeger or Stewart as she hit only .200 this year in 50 at-bats. 
But Haeger and Stewart’s defen-
sive abilities couldn’t compare to 
what Medina brought to the dia-
mond. 
She was indispensable at short, 
and Walton probably learned that lesson the hard way during her ju-nior season.
During a 15 game span from 
March 9, 2014 - April 2, 3024, Wal-ton benched Medina because he felt she wasn’t being the leader at short that she needed to be. 
The Gators went 8-7 in those 
15 games after starting the season 23-1.      
That’s how critical Medina was 
when she was on the ﬁ  eld and it’s safe to say that Florida wouldn’t have won back-to-back national titles if she wasn’t on the team.
Heading into next year, Walton 
has players on the team right now that can ﬁ  ll the production that Haeger had in the circle and at the plate this season.
But he doesn’t have anyone on 
the roster or the incoming class that will replace what Medina did for the team the last four years.
“She’s meant so much to our 
program,” Walton said. “I don’t know how we’re going to replace her to be honest. We’ve got good players, but none of the caliber and 
the leadership of her just because 
she was kind of groomed to be that 
kind of player.
“Right now that’s going to be a 
huge void for us moving forward 
even though we got great players, 
nobody is going to be Katie Me-
dina.”
NCAA implements basketball rules changes
The NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel approved a series of rules changes 
on Monday for men's and women's basketball. Men's basketball will now have a 30-second shot clock, among other changes. Women's basketball will be played in four 10-minute quarters rather than two 20-minute halves.

RICHIE MARTIN WAS 
SELECTED 20TH 
OVERALL BY THE 
OAKLAND ATHLETICS.
By Ian Cohen

@icohenb
Florida’s Richie Martin was 
selected 20th overall by the Oak-land Athletics in the ﬁ  rst round 
of the Major League Baseball 
draft on Monday.
Martin, one of the nation’s 
top collegiate shortstops, hit 
.292 with a team-high 59 runs 
this season. 
But his best attribute was his 
defense.
This season, Martin anchored 
the nation’s No. 1 defense in ﬁ  elding percentage (.985), and 
recorded a .974 percentage of his own. 
Martin also had only eight 
errors, one more than No. 1 overall pick shortstop Dansby Swanson (Vanderbilt) and one less than No. 2 pick Alex Breg-
man (LSU). 
After being named to the 
2014 Brooks Wallace Award 
watch list, given to the coun-try’s best shortstop, Martin had 
a down sophomore year. 
He dropped from a .300 bat-
ting average his freshman sea-
son to .265 his second year, and had 21 errors.
But after a successful sum-
mer playing in the Cape Cod Baseball League in 2014, where he recorded 20 RBIs and 17 sto-len bases and was named to the CCBL All-Star team, Martin ﬂ  ourished in his junior year at UF.

Tucker was taken ﬁ  fth by the Houston Astros, joining his brother and former Gator Pres-ton Tucker. It is unclear wheth-er Kyle Tucker will attend UF next year or decide to sign with the Astros.UF baseball shortstop

Walton praises underrated Medina during

FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — The 
New England Patriots released 
linebacker Brandon Spikes on Monday as authorities investi-gated whether his Mercedes was 
involved in an accident after the 
car was found abandoned in a highway median near where three people were hurt in a ve-hicle that was rear-ended.
While it’s not clear who had 
been driving, the operator of 
Spikes’ 2011 Mercedes Maybach 
reported through the car’s On-Star navigation system that it hit a deer, Massachusetts State Po-lice spokesman David Procopio said in a statement. The car was found at about 3:30 a.m. Sun-day with front-end damage in the median of Interstate 495 in 
Foxborough, near Patriots team 
headquarters.Around the same time, troop-
ers got a report that a car in the same area as the abandoned car had been rear-ended by a vehicle the occupants did not see. Three 
people — a 52-year-old  
man, a 32-year-
old woman 
and a 12-year-old boy, all from Billerica — were taken to a hospital with minor in-
juries, authorities said.
No connection has been es-
tablished and no charges have been ﬁ  led. Police say they have contacted Spikes and are investi-gating whether the incidents are related.
Phone and email messages 
left with Spikes’ agent weren’t immediately returned.Former Gator dropped

IT’S COHEN DOWN
If you were sitting in the stands of 
McKethan Stadium on April 7, watch-ing closely as JJ Schwarz hit his fourth 
home run of the game, and then fol-
lowed the freshman as he trotted 
around the bases and galloped back into his dugout, you might have thought this was 
the norm.
Soundless and still, Schwarz’s team-
mates didn’t stir. 
They gave him the silent treatment af-
ter one of the most proliﬁ  c performances Florida baseball has ever seen, and likely 
might ever see.
You, bemused from the bleachers, might 
have brushed off the home runs as four cra-
zy, conﬁ  ned coincidences, something that 
will never happen again. But then, later that week, Schwarz hit three more homers to catapult himself into the national colle-giate spotlight.
Like anyone else, coach Kevin O’Sullivan 
was in awe. But he wouldn’t let the success get to the freshman’s head.
“Those days, those weeks, I don’t know 
if it’s ever gonna happen again,” O’Sullivan told Schwarz.
Perhaps Schwarz needed 
to hear those words. After his 
week of seven home runs, the 
freshman predictably dropped off — in batting average, in home runs, in nearly every sta-
tistical category.
Over his next thirteen 
games, Schwarz went 9-for-39 
with just one more home run, fell almost a full point in slugging percentage and  struck 
out nine times.
After the week he had and the inconsis-
tencies that are expected from a ﬁ  rst-year 
player, his temporary decline was more 
than excusable.
After all, as a team, Florida went through 
a similar slump just a few weeks earlier.
Before Schwarz’s statistical anomaly 
against Stetson in April, UF had lost three of its last four games, and dropped two of 
its last four Friday and Saturday night out-ings, a stretch that exposed its underper-forming starting pitching staff.
Logan Shore and A.J. Puk combined to allow 25 hits and 15 runs over those four starts, and by the end, Puk was especially labor-
ing, tallying the team’s second-
highest ERA (4.20) of pitchers who had recorded at least 10 appearances.
“There was just something 
missing, and I couldn’t really put my ﬁ  nger on it. Maybe it 
was just more consistency more than any-thing else,” O’Sullivan said. “We’d show 
ﬂ  ashes for a week or so and then we would 
back off a hair. Maybe some of it had to do with injuries … but probably a lot of it had to do with getting A.J. going.”
And then, just like Schwarz against Stet-
son, the Gators took off.
They won seven of their last nine games, 
including a series win against Vanderbilt that seemed to foreshadow what was to 
come.
After an opening round loss to Arkan-
sas in the Southeastern Conference Tourna-
ment, they breezed through their next nine 
opponents, scoring 83 runs against the op-position’s 18.
Their pitchers dominated, their offense 
produced, and the freshmen facilitated a forceful postseason run.
And Schwarz, well … he simply Schwar-
zed. He was named both the SEC Tourna-
ment and Regional Round MVP, and will 
look to do the same when No. 4 national 
seed Florida (49-16) faces No. 5 national seed Miami (49-15) on Saturday at 8 p.m. on ESPN in the College World Series in Omaha, Nebraska. 
“He’s just a special player,” O’Sullivan 
beamed after UF clinched its ninth Omaha appearance on Saturday. “Special hitter, special catcher.”
Schwarz is leading UF on a special run.From a player standpoint, no one knows 
more about postseason runs, or lack there-of, than senior Bobby Poyner, who endured two years of Regional exits after advancing 
to the CWS his freshman year.
Last Saturday, when asked to put Flori-
da’s complicated and arduous season into 
words, Poyner simply stated the truth:
“We just got hot at the right time.” Schwarz, Gator baseball team peaking heading into CWS

Mike Holloway is no stranger to success 
when it comes to the NCAA Outdoor Cham-
pionships.
The Florida track and field coach — re-
cently named the Southeastern Conference Outdoor Men’s Coach of the Year — won back-to-back men’s titles in 2012-2013, and 
has finished in the top-two four times in the 
last five national outdoor meets.
Last year, despite putting up the most 
points at NCAA Outdoor Championships in Holloway’s tenure, the men’s team finished 
second to an Oregon squad that took the na-
tional crown.
Now, with the 2015 NCAA Outdoor Cham-
pionships beginning Wednesday, the Gators and Ducks are back in Eugene, Oregon, ready to fight for another outdoor championship to put in their respective trophy cases.
The two schools, separated by almost 
3,000 miles, have a recent history of neck-and-neck competition at men’s national meets.
In the 2014 outdoor national meet, the Or-
egon men scored 88 points to Florida’s 70, with the difference coming in the 5000-meter run. The Ducks etched a 2-3-4 finish in the event, capturing the 18 points that separated 
the two institutions while doing so.
In the NCAA Indoor Championships ear-
lier this year, the Oregon and Florida men were tied at 50 points each going into the fi-
nal two events — the 3000-meter run and the 
4x400 relay. The Ducks finished 1-2-3 in the 
3000, earning 24 points to clinch a national title.
This year, the Oregon men were able to 
secure a dominating 23 event entries, com-pared to 13 for Florida.
The Ducks also accumulated the most en-tries in the women’s field with 22.
Despite Florida’s struggles against the 
west coast powerhouse, Holloway has been waiting for this moment since last year’s loss 
in Eugene.
“We just got beat by a phenomenal Or-
egon team,” Holloway said in a release fol-
lowing the 2014 national outdoor meet, “and we’ll be back next year.”
On the men’s side, the No. 1 Gators will be 
lead by jumper Marquis Dendy, competing in his final collegiate event of his historic career. Dendy, named the USTFCCCA South Region Men’s Field Athlete of the Year on Monday, will look to complete a national and confer-ence sweep of both the triple and long jump.
Florida’s eight remaining men’s individual 
athletes are sprinters Dedric Dukes (100-me-ter dash) and Najee Glass (400-meter dash), hurdlers Eric Futch (400-meter hurdle) and Yanick Hart (110-meter hurdle), the 800-me-
ter duo of Andres Arroyo and Ryan Schnulle, 
UF steeplechase record holder Mark Parrish and Croatian shot-putter Stipe Zunic.
The No. 6 Florida women will be repre-
sented by 11 athletes in Eugene, highlighted by five athletes who rank in the top-10 in their respective outdoor events, including ju-nior sprinter Kyra Jefferson. Jefferson broke the UF record and set the eighth-best mark in 
NCAA history in the 200-meter sprint at the 
NCAA East Preliminaries in Jacksonville.
Junior mid-distance runner Claudia Fran-
cis will make her first competitive appear-
ance in Eugene since transferring from the 
host school to UF before this season. Running in the 800, Francis holds the 12th-best time in the event in the nation.
The combination of Florida’s status as the 
top-ranked men’s team and the overwhelm-ing amount of Oregon athletes competing on its home turf, especially its seven distance runners, would cause one to think that Hol-
loway feels worried about the Ducks, but the 
13th-year head coach holds a very simple mindset when it comes to facing tough com-petition.
“I try to take care of the Gators,” Hollo-
way said on Jan. 28. “That’s always been my focus.”16   ALLIGATOR    TUESDAY, JUNE 9, 2015
