Graduates from UF are expected to do great things, but the 
12 alumni serving in the U.S. Congress show just how far a UF 
degree can go.
UF was recently ranked among the top 20 universities with 
most alumni as congressional representatives, which placed it above Ivy League schools like Princeton University, Columbia 
University and Dartmouth College. 
Although Harvard University, Georgetown University and 
Yale University topped the list, the majority of schools named 
in the top 20 were public universities from large states, like UF, the University of Texas and the University of Georgia. 
Florida State University has four alumni in Congress.Michael Martinez, a UF political science professor, said these 
colleges may produce the majority of congressional representa-tion because they are the ﬂ  agship, or leadership, universities in those states. Larger states have more representatives and more 
opportunities for alumni to be elected. 
“I think it shows that within each state there are universities 
that attract the next generation of political leaders, and I think that’s UF in Florida,” he said.
UF has a history of producing those kinds of students, which 
Martinez said led the political science department to create a 
graduate program and undergraduate certiﬁ  cate in political campaigning.
He said two of the Gator graduates in Congress, Thomas 
Rooney and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, went through this program.
“People wanted to have a degree program that would teach 
them the skills that would be useful in political careers,” Mar-
tinez said.

The man behind the site that crowds Fa-
cebook feeds with whimsical quizzes and 
listicles is coming to UF. 
The Accent Speaker’s Bureau is bringing 
Jonah Peretti to the Curtis M. Phillips Center 
for the Performing Arts on March 20. Peretti 
is the founder and CEO of BuzzFeed as well as co-founder of the Hufﬁ  ngton Post. 
Daniel Landesberg, the chairman of Ac-
cent Speaker’s Bureau, said Peretti will dis-
cuss the new age of social media, entrepre-
neurship and news. 
“Most college students would agree 
BuzzFeed, which is mixing social media with news and popular Internet content, is really popular right now,” Landesberg said. Landesberg said a lot of students don’t 
take the time to read long-form news ar-ticles, so BuzzFeed’s easy-to-read style lets 
students stay informed in an entertaining way.
Tickets will be available at the Phillips 
Center Box Ofﬁ  ce for students March 19 at 
noon and March 20 at 5 p.m. for the general public. Doors open at 7 p.m. 
Accent paid Peretti $40,000 to speak.Fernando Caffoll, a 22-year-old UF me-
chanical and aerospace engineering senior, said BuzzFeed articles don’t seem appeal-ing, but seeing Peretti speak would be inter-esting.
“I probably wouldn’t go for funsies,” 
Caffoll said. “But if I have time, I’d go.” Quiz: Which Florida School Will Soon Host BuzzFeed’s CEO?

Barbara Ruth says she’s no lon-
ger campaigning for a City Com-
mission seat.  
At the League of Women Voters 
City Commission candidate forum Tuesday, Ruth told her fellow can-didates she was done campaigning.  
The former At-large Seat 2 can-
didate initially decided to run be-cause she said she felt stuck and 
complacent, but 
now she’s lost all 
momentum.
“I didn’t have 
a great chance to 
win,” she said. 
“I just wanted to 
not be a spoiler for any one camp. This might let one of them win it 
outright.”Ruth, 65, will now ofﬁ  cially en-
dorse At-large Seat 2 candidate Helen Warren.
Warren said she and Ruth would 
have divided the same pool of vot-
ers.
“I appreciate that she is giving 
her support to me because it’s go-ing to be a close race as it is,” War-ren said.   Commission candidate to withdrawUF recognized for

SPOKE TO STUDENTS.
KYLE FOLLANSBEE
Alligator Contributing Writer
A former astronaut gave Gator engi-
neering students a chance to shoot for 
the stars Wednesday evening.
James Donald Halsell Jr., the techni-
cal director for advanced space launch 
systems at Dynetics Inc., spoke about 
his NASA career at  6 p.m. in the New Physics Building during a recruiting in-formation session for Dynetics.
He piloted two of his five total mis-
sions and commanded the other three. He’s logged about 52 days in space.
Halsell showed the group of about 
20 students a short video of his experi-
ence on a mission to the International 
Space Station in 2000.
“It was just as exciting as you’d 
think,” Halsell said. “No matter how many degrees you get at UF, you will still play with your food in space.”Halsell discussed the tasks he ac-
complished on board the ISS, including a night-landing mission.
“The 3,000-degree plasma that is 
generated by air friction as you slam into the Earth’s upper atmosphere… 
that’s what actually slows the shuttle 
down,” Halsell said. “It was my first night landing, so I was excited for that.”
Dynetics Inc. is a 1,300-employee 
company with headquarters in Hunts-ville, Ala. It covers areas including in-telligence, sensors, missile systems and space. 
Matt Fidler, a 25-year-old UF com-
puter engineering junior, said he at-tended the event because he was look-ing for an internship this summer with Dynetics Inc.
Andrew Mortellaro, a 21-year-old 
UF electrical engineering senior, in-terned with the company last summer.
“As the summer progressed, I picked 
up different skills,” Mortellaro said. “I had to get a security clearance, so I can’t tell you everything I worked on.”Astronaut launches UF careersCAMPUS

Two UF students were invited to attend 
a USA rugby academy this summer at the 
Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, Ca-lif., but funding the trip could prove a hurdle for the Gator athletes.
Gabrielle Zablan and Stephanie Browne 
were invited to the training center after at-tending a high-performance training camp 
in Georgia two weeks ago.
Together, the athletes are working on 
ideas for fundraising money to finance the 
high cost of the trip. 
Zablan, a 19-year-old UF athletic training 
sophomore, began a crowdfunding cam-
paign on GoFundMe earlier this week. As 
of press time, it had raised about $250 of her $1,700 goal.
Eric Keys, head coach of the UF women’s 
rugby club team, said he was not shocked by the nomination of the two players due to their strong athletic abilities.
Keys, an assistant professor of geography 
at UF, said he considers the nominations a 
big deal for the rugby club team and said 
they should be seen as a pathway toward bigger goals.
“This is a way for athletes to get on the Olympic team,” he said.
Zablan said attending the camp is a step 
toward reaching her dreams.
She began playing in October and said 
the first rugby game she ever watched was the first match she played in. 
“Ideally, I would like to go to the Olym-
pics,” she said. “I don’t know if 2016 is a pos-sibility, but 2020 would be awesome.”
Browne, a 20-year-old UF statistics junior, 
said she is excited to share this experience alongside a teammate.
“It helps develop our players and make 
our team better as a whole,” she said.
Her long-term goals are similar to 
Zablan’s. She hopes to represent the U.S. at the Olympics in the future.
“I think I have a pretty good shot at play-
ing in the (Rugby) World Cup one day or the Olympics maybe, if everything works out,” she said. “That’s the goal, but I know it won’t be easy at all.”UF Olympic hopefuls crowdfund
“I think I have a pretty good shot

Stephanie Browne
UF statistics juniorBesides creating role models to in-
spire current UF students, Martinez 
said having alumni in Congress may give UF an advantage in legislative is-
sues.
“There are 12 members of Congress 
that will hopefully at least open the 
door and listen to what UF has to say,” 
he said.
Hadar Arazi, a 19-year-old UF po-
litical science sophomore and Student 
Senator representing the College of 
Liberal Arts and Sciences, said she was 
inspired by the accomplishments of Gator graduates before her.
“I think it shows that anybody 
can go on to be a representative if it’s 
something that you really want,” she 
said. “I think it’s cool that there are so many footsteps to follow in.”
Student Senator Bradley Bean, a 
19-year-old UF industrial systems en-
gineering sophomore, said although the announcement comes as no sur-prise to him, having so many alumni 
in Congress speaks volumes about the value of a UF education.
“It means that our education is pre-
paring us for leadership roles in the real world,” he said. “I think it’s great to know that our education actually 
means something.”SAMANTHA BLEND

Emily Jacobus is no stranger to the 
dreaded sight of a citation sticking out 
from her windshield wiper.
That dread is something a new iP-
hone app called Fixed hopes to ease.
The app is expected to launch next 
week, several news outlets reported. Initially it will be available in San Fran-cisco, but the founders said they hope to expand to other major cities in the U.S. soon.
According to the app’s website, a 
person can contest his or her parking ticket by submitting a photo of the 
ticket along with the violation code. 
The app then informs the user of the probability of successfully appealing the ticket.
It can also inform the user of what 
evidence he or she needs to collect in order to support the appeal.
If the appeal is successful, Fixed charges the user 25 percent of the fine. If not, it doesn’t charge the user.
Jacobus, a 20-year-old UF chemi-
cal engineering junior, said she would consider using the app for future tick-ets, especially in more populated areas with more expensive citation fines.
Scott Fox, the director of UF’s trans-
portation and parking services, said he 
appreciates the app’s concept because 
it helps users navigate the appeal pro-cess and motivates parking services to hand out accurate tickets. 
He is familiar with the appeal pro-
cess not only because he is the director of transportation and parking, but also because he has gotten multiple park-ing citations himself.
“In fact,” Fox said, “they kind of 
like to get me.”
If the app became available in 
Gainesville, he said he doesn’t think it would cause a significant change in collected revenue or parking regula-tions.

UF took a major step this week toward 
its initiative of Zero Waste by 2015.
The Reitz Union and Fresh Food Com-
pany locations have started composting 
after recently signing a contract with WCA, 
a waste and recycling management com-
pany.
According to UF’s Living Green website, 
“composting is the biological decomposi-tion of organic waste such as food or plant material by bacteria, fungi, worms and other organisms under controlled aerobic ... conditions.”Taylor Cremo, an account executive for 
WCA, said this is an “easy behavior change” on the path to sustainability. This relatively small change could end up making a big im-pact on UF’s waste stream, she said. 
A 2009 study reported about 15 percent 
of UF’s total waste was from food waste alone, Cremo said.
She said the dining halls produce about 
2,000 pounds of food waste every day.
Cremo said she wants this decision to 
make an impact on how all UF students view sustainability.
“My hope is that Florida Gators leave 
this university with an understanding that waste is a resource and live their lives ac-cordingly,” Cremo said. 
But this isn’t the first time UF has put its 
composting efforts to good use. 
WCA and UF composted more than 
50,000 pounds of waste during the 2013 football season. 
Some students on campus said they think 
this is a positive change for the university.Amanda DeCanio, a 20-year-old UF en-
vironmental engineering sophomore, said she is impressed by the university’s deci-sion to start composting.
“It is an outward and very public dem-
onstration to students, staff, professors and the Gainesville community of UF’s commit-ment to the environment and Zero Waste initiative,” DeCanio said. “This is very tell-ing and proves we should be on the lookout for future changes to UF.”
Kyle Rodriguez, a 21-year-old UF sus-
tainability junior, said he also thinks this program has the potential to be successful.
“I feel like it’s a great step forward,” Ro-
driguez said. “Not only does it reduce the amount of waste at the Reitz Union, but it also serves to educate students about the ... ways you can live a sustainable lifestyle.” Reitz, Fresh Food Company compost in sustainability efforts
UF hopes for zero waste by 2015
“My hope is that Florida

an understanding that waste is 
a resource and live their lives 
accordingly.”

She is endorsing Helen Warren
Although Ruth has not for-
mally withdrawn, she said she 
plans to make it official soon. 
To withdraw, Ruth would 
need to contact the Supervi-sor of Elections office, which would then place notices at 
the voting precincts.
Elections supervisor Pam 
Carpenter said if Ruth with-
draws, her name will still appear on the ballot, but her 
votes will not count.  
“We have had this happen 
before, so we have a process 
for it,” Carpenter said.
Ruth used about $600 to 
fund her campaign. She said she didn’t have any other do-nors in line to support it fur-ther. 
Mark Venzke, also an At-
large Seat 2 candidate, said he was not surprised to hear about Ruth’s endorsement of Warren.
“Helen is most closely 
aligned with Barbara Ruth’s general philosophies and sen-sibilities,” he said.
Ruth first moved to 
Gainesville after her hus-band, a Vietnam War veteran, passed away from pancreatic 
cancer. She has lived in her 
marigold yellow house in the Stephen Foster Neighborhood for almost 12 years. During 
that time, Ruth ran a small 
massage-therapy business and became an ordained minister.
Ruth, who is vice president 
of the Stephen Foster Neigh-
borhood Association, said her 
first foray into politics was in 2006. She rallied with other residents of the neighborhood against the expansion of the 
city public work’s fleet garage 
next to the neighborhood. The group of neighbors led the city to move the facility out of its boundaries.
She said the experience 
taught her the importance of openness between the City Commission and the public.
“Making the people truly 
aware of what the plans are is a key thing,” she said.
Ruth will remain active in 
her neighborhood and efforts 
to help with cleanup plans for 
the Cabot-Koppers Superfund Site. 
Now that her campaign is 
over, Ruth said she’ll have to 
find a job. But she said ending 
it was the best decision she could’ve made.
“It’s a relief,” she said. “I’ve 
done my best and spoke from my heart.” CAndId ATE ,

Gainesville Police arrested a 28-year-
old man Tuesday after he sold marijuana 
to undercover ofﬁ  cers, according to a GPD 
arrest report. The sting was in response to 
residents’ complaints about drug dealing in 
the area. 
At about 1 p.m., two on-
duty, undercover ofﬁ  cers drove into Candlelight Es-tates Mobile Home Com-munity, located at 1600 NE 12th Ave. 
The ofﬁ  cers met Walter 
Bernard Summers Jr. in front of a lot and asked if 
he had any “mollies,” but Summers said he 
didn’t have any. An ofﬁ  cer then asked if he 
had any weed, and Summers said yes, ac-cording to the report.
One of the ofﬁ  cers gave him $20, and 
Summers went into a nearby home, return-ing with 7.2 grams of marijuana that he handed over.
When uniformed ofﬁ  cers appeared, Sum-
mers ran through the trailers and jumped a 4-foot fence, according to the report. 
He then gave up and put his hands in the 
air, saying “OK, you got me,” according to 
the report. 
Ofﬁ  cers also found a bag ﬁ  lled with 1.4 
grams of marijuana in his left pants pocket. 
Bernard was charged with selling a con-
trolled substance and possession of less 
than 20 grams of marijuana, according to the report. 
He was booked into the Alachua Coun-
ty Jail at about 1:30 p.m. and was released 
Wednesday after meeting a $10,000 bond. Man sells pot to cops, arrested

liance are encouraging students to “Be 
an Elefriend” the week after Spring Break.
Christina Bicknell, a peta2 campus 
representative for UF, said the cam-paign was created after the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus came to the Stephen C. O’Connell Center last month. Bicknell said Florida is one of the few states where universities still al-low the circus to come to campus.
“It is unfortunate that a place for 
higher learning would support an event that has no educational purpose and promotes animal cruelty,” she said.
Activists will hand out literature on 
campus about animal cruelty and let students sign a petition to block the cir-cus from UF in the future. 
Anna Sandoval, a 19-year-old UF ex-
ercise physiology sophomore, said she supports the campaign.
“This event opens up a very differ-
ent perspective to something I used to love as a child,” she said.Anti-cruelty campaign

What accounts for  
alcohol abuse?
Predictably, as March approaches, news outlets will 
start releasing “shocking exposés” revealing the “dark 
side of Spring Break” as if we didn’t know drunken 
college students fall off balconies in Panama City every 
year. Trend writers would have you believe all students view Spring Break as a weeklong free-for-all, and while this 
isn’t necessarily true — we have Habitat for Humanity and 
other things to do, after all — it’s true that alcohol abuse is a 
pervasive problem in American university culture. 
Despite the fact that there’s a wealth of information and 
resources available to students — at UF we have GatorWell 
and the medical amnesty policy, for example — binge drink-
ing still happens at an exorbitant rate on campus. According to an Alligator report Monday, one to two alcohol-poison-ing transports are reported on campus every weekend, and about 20 to 30 on-campus drunken driving cases occur each year. 
Pinpointing the source of college binge-drinking culture 
is difﬁ  cult. How big of an impact do parents play in the de-velopment of their children’s attitudes toward alcohol? Is 
the known European model of allowing children to drink 
with meals effective in reducing alcohol abuse later in life? Do the minimum-age laws for alcohol purchase really make a difference when it comes to college binge drinking? 
The answers are complicated. A 2009 study in Science 
Daily reported that parents who adopted a relaxed attitude toward allowing their children to drink revealed that those 
children were more likely to binge drink in college. Further 
research is needed, however — the researcher admitted she didn’t separate students who speciﬁ  cally drank with their parents during meals from those who let their kids drink inside and outside the house. 
In regards to the drinking-age limit, some argue the arbi-
trary age of 21 has no effect on students’ binge-drinking ten-dencies. If a college student younger than 21 wants alcohol, 
they reason, he or she has the means to ﬁ  nd it. 
While this is true, the same logic can be applied to all 
other areas of the law: hard-drug consumption, illegal ﬁ  re-
arm ownership and assault. If people want them or want to do them, what is stopping them?
And anyway, researchers have claimed that the mini-
mum drinking age does indeed have an effect on the num-ber of drunk-driving incidents involving young adults. 
The Alligator report said, “research, collected since 2006, 
indicated that the age-21 drinking laws are associated with lower rates of drunken driving accidents and other dangers of excessive drinking.”
Clearly, a myriad of factors contribute to college stu-
dents’ binge drinking tendencies. 
For now, all we can do is keep the drinking age at 21 and 
hold parents accountable for helping their children develop healthy attitudes toward alcohol. That moderation is para-mount, for both your safety and health.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgWednesday’s question: Do you agree 
with the legal drinking age?Today’s question: Do you like BuzzFeed?Net neutrality is a thing of the past  
Think about the nature of the Internet. It’s anything 
and everything at your ﬁ  ngertips whenever you want it. One day, we will tell our children we lived 
in a time when information was truly free.
Net neutrality began unraveling in January with a Su-
preme Court decision against the Federal Communica-tions Commission. Years ago, the FCC classiﬁ  ed Internet Service Providers in a way that limited the commission’s ability to regulate them. Because of this, Verizon sued the FCC, arguing the commission didn’t have the author-ity to enforce net neutrality. The Supreme Court agreed with Verizon.
Net neutrality works to ensure the Internet is a level 
playing ﬁ  eld for everyone. Without it, ISPs could charge Internet companies more to access its servers, only to slow service if they don’t cough up the money. This helps small companies with few resources grow by avoiding substantial costs to be competitive.
Without the regulations, big Internet companies like 
Netﬂ  ix may be required to pay more for the same speed service as other companies or might cut deals with the ISPs to ensure preferential treatment for their trafﬁ  c. Of course, this extra cost would most likely be passed on to consumers, driving prices up.
Net neutrality advocates still have hope. The Supreme 
Court gave the FCC a way out. The court basically said the FCC can regulate the way ISPs treat trafﬁ  c as long as it promotes broadband development.
Unfortunately, Netﬂ  ix essentially threw that hope 
away in a deal made with Comcast on Sunday.
Comcast is the world’s largest cable provider and is 
set to buy out Time Warner Cable in another recently an-nounced deal. If the purchase goes through, Comcast will be the Internet provider to nearly 40 percent of homes. That said, Netﬂ  ix has seen 25 percent slower service to Comcast subscribers over the past few months. 
Because of the infrastructure of the Internet, data doesn’t always go directly from companies like Netﬂ  ix to service providers. In Netﬂ  ix’s case, sending trafﬁ  c through an intermediary before Comcast was the cause of the slowdown. Much like roads jamming when there are too many cars, cables jam when there is too much 
data. With Netﬂ  ix accounting for 30 percent of all Inter-net trafﬁ  c during peak times, it’s no mystery why content travelled slower. 
The deal between the two companies will give Net-
ﬂ  ix direct access to Comcast’s servers, no middleman required. In other words, they’re paying for better per-formance, pulling the philosophy of net neutrality up by the roots. 
So get comfy with Netﬂ  ix, Facebook and other Inter-
net giants. It’s likely without net neutrality in place, there will be fewer big breaks for Internet start-ups that rely on the decentralized, competitive nature of the Internet. 
It would be extremely difﬁ  cult for any would-be Net-
ﬂ  ix challenger to get the funds to purchase the same ac-cess that Netﬂ  ix has. Little access means fewer customers, meaning small companies will have a hard time getting off the ground.
It’s important to note that this doesn’t necessarily 
violate net neutrality so much as it goes around it. Net neutrality focuses on trafﬁ  c discrimination. This deal is about Netﬂ  ix’s ability to directly connect to Comcast’s servers. 
But that’s what makes it so problematic. Even if net 
neutrality is resurrected, the philosophy behind it has al-ready been undermined. If this becomes the new norm, the Internet as we know it is dead.

McDONALD’S.
ELLY AYRES
Avenue Writer
Sandwiched between London 
and Paris fashion weeks, Milan’s 
autumn/winter ready-to-wear col-lections brought a delicious dose of cool to the table. For the past week, 
designers dished up the most envi-
able of cold-weather trends — their inspiration rising from the depths of centuries-old fairytale books to the height of McDonald’s golden arches.
One of the most talked-about 
shows was Jeremy Scott’s Moschino collection, which was all about the 
overstatement of pop culture. Scott 
held a magnifying glass up to our label-conscious, name brand-centric culture, changing fast food into fast fashion.
One model dressed in a typical 
takeout-girl uniform carried her Mc-Donald’s kid’s meal purse on a tray down the catwalk, while a handful of others were wrapped up in, well, candy wrappers. The label’s sig-nature “Moschino” nameplate belt found itself reimagined — this time wrapped continuously around one of the skirts and corresponding pair 
of thigh-high boots.
Although Scott’s cheeky sense of 
humor sang the praises of over-the-
top dressing, Gucci’s creative direc-tor, Frida Giannini, opted for more subtle glamour. Clean lines and smaller silhouettes were the word, and models decked out in pastel 
shades of blue, green, pink and yel-
low flaunted a refreshing balance of casual luxury. Upscale materials like fur and leather were shaped into laid-back garments most would 
never expect, and the irony of fine 
fur on a sweatshirt was not lost on the audience. Snakeskin knee-high boots were woven throughout the looks, and models surveyed the 
crowd from behind barely tinted 
oversized sunglasses. And perhaps the biggest surprise of all from the elegant brand: blue jeans.
Dolce & Gabbana hit an especial-
ly high note with its dark fairytale-like collection, composed of about 70 looks that personified the contents of a storybook. However, in this case, the typical damsel in distress was nowhere to be found. Red Riding Hood was certainly present, but she came in the form of a fierce-looking heroine in a blood red, hooded fur 
coat. Female knights in chainmail 
stormed the runway, though their knee-high heeled metallic boots (looking exactly like the bottom half of full-on armor) might get stuck in the battlefield. Romantic notions floated within the collection as well in the form of lacy, jewel-toned coats sporting flora and fauna.
Fashionistas still haven’t forgot-
ten Fendi’s fantastic collection by Karl Lagerfeld, which was rooted in its theme of transience and travel. Lagerfeld cited Billie Holiday’s “Vio-lets For Your Furs” as an inspiration, explaining how lovers used to pin flowers to their departing significant others’ coats when they travelled. 
Entire orchid branches were pinned 
to many of Fendi’s fur cloaks, which were practical shades of deep blue, brown and olive.
Though Italy may be lauded for 
its impressive cuisine, it was defi-nitely the couture that left the fash-ion crowd supremely satiated and ready for round four of the fashion 
weeks, which started in Paris on 
Tuesday.

After breaking onto the scene more than 
a decade ago with cooing vocals on “The 
Creek Drank the Cradle,” Sam Beam, known as Iron & Wine, has repeatedly redefined his music. 
Known best for his lyrical imagery, 
Beam’s progression has been distinct, mov-ing from the hushed twang of “Our Endless Numbered Days” and the guitar-picking Americana of “The Shepherd’s Dog” to the 
more layered rhythms and full band on 
“Kiss Each Other Clean.” Beam’s latest al-bum, “Ghost on Ghost,” is no exception, still placing the emphasis on his songwriting but with a higher energy. 
Before Iron & Wine takes the stage Friday 
night at the Phillips Center for the Perform-
ing Arts, we caught up with Beam. And, yes, 
his voice sounds just as sweet on the phone. 
Q: You are an artist who redefines your 
work, and you can see that in the progres-sion from your earlier 2000 stuff to “Ghost on Ghost.” Is there somewhere musically that you see Iron & Wine going next?
 A: I don’t really know. 
I’m chasing something interesting, but no idea what it was going to look like. I have no idea what’s going to happen, which makes it kind of fun.
 
 Q: A lot of your songs 
feel very personal. Where 
do you draw your inspiration from? Is any-
thing in your life off-limits to write about?
 A: No, not really. Really personal or not 
— it all sounds personal — so you never know if I’m telling what really happened or if I made it up. There are parts of my life that 
are more interesting to write about, but at 
the same time, nothing’s off-limits. I’m not going to give you my social security or any-thing. Inspiration comes from all over the place — stories that I read or were told about from other people. A lot is just pure fantasy. I’m interested in narratives, loose or specific. 
It’s just not a diary entry but the way I feel.
 
Q: What was it about this set of songs 
that you felt you could collect them all together? How did you narrow down the songs to include on “Ghost on Ghost”?
 A: This one in particular was a little looser 
than the last few. In “The Shepherd’s Dog,” 
there was a dog included in every song. And 
then the record after that, there was a river. This time, I noticed I had a lot of songs with this central couple. If you try real hard, it could sound like that. A lot of different place names, and it’s this couple against the world or the couple against the town they’re in. And that made the sounds feel similar.
 
Q: Looking back at who you were as an 
artist when you released “Creek Drank the 
Cradle,” which is heavy on the acoustics, would you have thought “Ghost on Ghost” is something you would have ever made?
 A: I wouldn’t have known how to do it. I 
don’t see an end. Then, I would never have felt like I was able to do that. I wouldn’t have any idea how to approach it. For me, this meant a decade worth of experience that I had. I would have loved to make a record like that. I’m not a jazz musician — I’ve picked up a lot — but at the time I knew about four or five chords. It was a fun way to spend the day. I wouldn’t have imagined 
I would have made the second album or the 
third.
 Q: What’s your writing process like? I 
have this image of you being the kind of songwriter to carry around a notebook in your pocket everywhere.
 A: I don’t carry it in my pocket, but I have 
it in a satchel wherever I go. I do have a lot of notes in my phone — it all goes in the phone these days. I treat it like a job in certain ways and try to sit down for a while every day.

Devil’s Millhopper Geological State Park
4732 Millhopper Road, Gainesville
Another place Lesma recommended people see in Gainesville is the Devil’s Millhopper Geological State Park, a large sinkhole 
turned state park.
There’s a nature trail that leads to the bottom of the sinkhole, where you can see waterfalls spilling into springs.
 “It’s deﬁ  nitely a sight to see,” Lesma said.Devil’s Den Springs
5390 NE 180th Ave., Williston
You can scuba dive (if you’re certiﬁ  ed) or snorkel in the Devil’s Den Spring. The underground spring is ﬁ  lled with fossils and 
rock formations, and the park where the spring is located is open for camping and lodging.
You cannot go underground to visit the spring unless you’re going scuba diving or snorkeling, according to the spring’s 
website.
Scarlette Lesma, a 21-year-old UF biomedical engineering junior, said she loved the time she went to Devil’s Den.
“It’s absolutely beautiful,” Lesma said. “Besides the spring, there’s an area to barbecue and enjoy the day.”Swamp Head Brewery
3140 SW 42nd Way, Gainesville
Spring Break is known as a week of drinking for college kids, so you can continue that tradition at the Swamp Head Brewery.
“We function like a small bar,” said Brandon Nappy, an employee at the brewery.
Swamp Head has ﬁ  ve year-round beers in its tasting room, and, don’t worry, you can take some home, too.
After you’ve gotten tired of drinking (if that’s possible), you can visit some of the area’s unique nature resorts.THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

BC Spring Break in Gainesville
For people staying in Gainesville for Spring Break, the weeklong hiatus from classes can be just as interesting as that of the 
vacationers heading out of town.
You may not be forgetting your day at one of Florida’s beaches or stumbling off and on cruise ships in the Caribbean, but you 
could be exploring the ins and outs of the Gainesville area your regular schedule may not allow you to visit.

The past year in cinema is seen 
by many as one of the tightest races 
in Oscar history, and with the vari-ety of powerful performances up for Hollywood’s biggest honors, 
this movie-goer agrees in full. Lu-
pita, Matthew, Chiwetel, Alfonso — so many names, so little trophies to distribute. To close out the 2014 award season (and subsequent Tro-phy Hunting coverage this semes-ter), I’m tackling six of the biggest categories in Tinseltown’s most cov-eted ceremony and casting my votes 
for the year’s biggest frontrunners. 
Note: I am not all-seeing. I may not get this right. If I do, then I will cel-ebrate accordingly. If I don’t, I will probably still celebrate accordingly. It is the Oscars, after all…
Best Picture
Frontrunner: “American Hustle”
Underdog: “12 Years A Slave”
These two ﬁ  lms have been neck-
and-neck all awards season. Each ﬁ  lm has strong casts with equally strong directors, as well as enough critic and audience praise. Honestly, it could go either way, but the slight edge goes to “American Hustle” winning the Golden Globe over “12 Years A Slave.” 
Best Actor in a Leading Role
Frontrunner: Matthew McConaughey 
in “Dallas Buyers Club”
Underdog: Chiwetel Ejiofor in “12 
Years A Slave”
I can attest that both of these ac-
tors deserve all the accolades they can get. Both have grit and gusto in 
their roles: one as a medication hus-
tler diagnosed with AIDS and another as a former free man kidnapped and forced back into slavery. Yet, in anoth-er close race, I think McConaughey’s almost sweep of awards season thus far will not fail him on Oscar night.
Best Actress in a Leading Role
Frontrunner: Cate Blanchett in “Blue 
Jasmine”
Underdog: Sandra Bullock in “Gravity”
Although this category isn’t as 
close as the others, there are still ﬁ  ve powerhouse leading ladies up for the statue. Blanchett has won nearly all of the awards in this category all season long, and I don’t think that Oscar night 
will be an exception to the trend. Bull-
ock gave a wonderful performance in her space-thriller, but it may not have enough gravitational force to pull it away from Blanchett.
Best Actor in a 
Supporting Role
Frontrunner: Jared 
Leto in “Dallas Buy-
ers Club”
Underdog: Barkhad 
Abdi in “Captain 
Phillips”
Out of all of the categories, this is 
the only one that, to me, has a clear winner. Jared Leto has become a sort of darling of this awards season with both critic and audience appraisal of his performance as the complex but endlessly lively Rayon. Everything about Leto’s portrayal has the quintes-sential makings of a star performance — the overall transformation (including 
major weight loss and lots of feminine 
ensemble pieces), the chemistry with McConaughey — everything. Don’t get me wrong, Abdi’s Somali captor in “Phillips” is a huge breakout role, but Leto’s certainly in for the win.
Best Actress in a Supporting Role
Frontrunner: Jennifer Lawrence in 
“American Hustle”
Underdog: Lupita Nyong’o in “12 
Years A Slave” Now before I get blasted for this 
line-up, let me preface this by saying that I think this is the closest race of 
the night. Lawrence, to me, is the only 
true standout performance in “Ameri-can Hustle” that would have a chance of winning an award in such tough cat-egories — and she beat out Nyong’o 
at the Golden Globes earlier this year. 
But the beautiful Lupita has won every 
other award — and everyone seems to be rallying for her. This will deﬁ  nitely 
be one of the moments that will keep 
viewers (and everyone in that room) on the edge of their seats. 
Best Directing
Frontrunner: “Gravity” - Alfonso 
Cuaron 
Underdog: “12 Years A Slave” - Steve 
McQueen 
Cuaron has been receiving major 
attention for his sci-ﬁ   thriller, while McQueen has garnered praise for his  raw look into Southern slavery. Both made breathtaking ﬁ  lms (which I am not exaggerating — both ﬁ  lms had moments that literally suspended my breathing for a second), but I think the cinematography and overall direction 
of “Gravity” will give the edge (and the 
Oscar) to Cuaron.Best Original Song
Frontrunner: “Let it Go” - “Frozen” 
Underdog: “Ordinary Love” - U2  
This one is a little tougher. Between 
“Frozen”’s anthemic ballad “Let It Go” and Pharrell William’s bouncy, buoy-ant “Happy” from “Despicable Me 2,” it could go either way. Throw in a little 
competition from, oh, I don’t know, 
U2, and this one could be a serious 
toss-up. Hopefully the performances of each of the songs (as well as “The 
Moon Song” from “Her”) will foreshad-
ow a winner. 
Best Original Screenplay
This is an easy one. If Spike Jonze 
doesn’t win for the funny, tender “Her,” then all hope is lost. That may sound a little melodramatic, but in a year where this ﬁ  lm didn’t get nearly enough nomi-
nations for what it deserved in terms 
of performances (hello, Joaquin Phoe-nix, I still love you), this one should be a given.
Catch the Oscars on Sunday at 7 
p.m. on ABC. And fear not — “Trophy Hunting” will be back next season with all the scoop on awards season.

Sure, it’s a throwback, but what better way to celebrate Spring Break than with James Franco in cornrows? For those of you who don’t know, “Spring Breakers” is about best friends who vacation in Florida and get mixed in with the wrong crowd. With so many one-liners and drunken nudity, “Spring Breakers” will eventually reach cult classic status.

If you don’t know who J. Cole and Chance 
The Rapper are, then it’s time to do some 
homework. The artists will perform at the 
Stephen C. O’Connell Center tonight, and the 
worst thing you could do is go to a concert where you don’t know at least one song.
What’s the fun of attending if you can’t 
sing (proudly and out of tune) with the artist and your friends? You could be that person who awkwardly bobs to the beat. But trust me, you’ll look so much cooler if you know the words to the songs and can really get into 
the music.
Here’s a list of songs to check out before 
the concert:
“Crooked Smile” by J. Cole featuring 
TLC
You have most likely heard this song on 
the radio, but take the time to listen again 
prior to the concert and really understand the lyrics. This song is about embracing your imperfections. It’s one of today’s few rap songs with an actual message, which is to love who you are.
“Forbidden Fruit” by J. Cole featuring 
Kendrick Lamar
Those of you who attended last year’s 
concert during Black History Month will get another taste of Kendrick Lamar in this song. It reﬂ  ects the theme of the album “Born Sinner.” In several songs on the al-bum, you’ll notice references to Adam and Eve, heaven, hell, church and God.
“She Knows” by J. Cole featuring Am-
ber Coffman and Cults
This song is so darn catchy. Seriously. 
By the time the song ends, you’ll be belt-ing out “she knows” over and over and over again.
“Work Out” by J. ColeThis is one of Cole’s more upbeat songs 
from his debut album. Honestly, this would be a great song to play when having sex. It’s not exactly baby-making music, but we all know what Cole is really thinking when he says, “I wanna see you work out for me.”
“Favorite Song” by Chance The Rapper 
featuring Childish Gambino
If the beat to this song sounds vaguely 
familiar even though you never heard this song before, you’re not going crazy. The beat is a sample from Betty Wright’s “Clean Up Woman,” giving the track an old-school sound. This feel-good track is perfect for when you ace that exam you spent all night studying for.
“Cocoa Butter Kisses” by Chance The 
Rapper featuring Vic Mensa and Twista
This laid-back song is 
perfect when you’re just re-laxing in your room. At ﬁ  rst listen, you may think this is just another rap song talking about smoking and drugs. The song is really 
about the rapper thinking back to the kiss-es he would get from his mother before he started smoking.
And class is dismissed. If you take a lis-
ten to the songs on this list, you’ll deﬁ  nitely be ready to show off your rapping skills at the concert tonight. 
I also recommend listening to Chance 
The Rapper’s most recent mixtape and Cole’s latest album for tonight’s show. Your J. Cole pre-concert playlistBUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

UF track and field 
starts competition at the SEC Championships today. Read the story on page 16.ERICA A. HERNANDEZ 
Alligator Writer @EricaAlyssa 
It may be the quickest event in a 
gymnastics meet, but vault is far from 
simple. 
Florida’s Kytra Hunter has found 
her place in vault history with her re-cent performances. 
In the past two weeks, Hunter has 
scored back-to-back 10s on vault. Hunter is one of two gymnasts in the country who have scored a 10 on vault this season. 
“Kytra, you know she’s just full of 
natural power and talent,” coach Rhon-da Faehn said. 
“She is one of, if not the best, I think, 
vaulter in the country.”
Hunter’s two 10s on vault are the 
sixth and seventh 10s on vault in pro-gram history.
The junior said she is comfortable 
with her routine, though she is the only Gator on the roster competing it. 
Hunter has owned a Yurchenko lay-
out with a one-and-a-half twist during her entire college career, but UF is not the first place she debuted her vault. 
The past two years, the highest score 
Hunter has achieved with her vault routine was a 9.975 on multiple occa-sions. 
“I’ve been so close to getting the 
10, I’m just glad that I finally got it on 
vault, especially,” Hunter said. 
“This year, I just feel a lot more re-
laxed. I’ve definitely been working on 
the little things like the stuck land-
ings.” MORGAN MORIARTY

Lincoln High, announced via Twitter that he was committing to Florida. 
Knight is the fifth com-
mitment of the 2015 class, which has picked up three verbal commitments in the last six days. Wide receiver 
Deondre Farrier, a Lake 
Nona native, committed on 
Friday, and wide receiver Tristan Payton, from Jack-
sonville First Academy, announced his ver-
bal commitment on Monday. 
As a junior at Lincoln, Knight averaged 
16 yards per catch and scored three touch-
downs. 
Florida is in desperate need of playmakers 
at tight end and wide receiver. To address that need, the Gators signed three wide receivers and two tight ends in their 2014 class. 
Florida’s tight ends made a minimal im-
pact in UF’s 4-8 season.
Clay Burton recorded his only reception 
of 2013 in the last game of the season against FSU, and his backup, Tevin Westbrook, had only three catches for 30 yards. 
Sophomore Kent Taylor transferred to 
Kansas following the 2013 season, and Colin Thompson, a four-star recruit from the 2011 class, has seen the field only three times in his 
career due to injuries.

Although Florida might not face a better 
starting rotation than it did against Miami, it 
held its own in its first road series this season 
— even though the team dropped the series.
The No. 23 Gators (5-3) threw eight fresh-
men and saw five more get action at the 
plate against the Hurricanes’ deep pitch-ing staff, led by left-handers Chris Diaz, Bryan Radziewski and Andrew Suarez.  
Florida avoided the sweep, driving in four first-inning runs off Suarez en route to a 6-4 
victory in the finale. Florida hosts Illinois (2-4) 
and Florida Gulf Coast (5-3) in a round-robin tournament at McKethan Stadium starting Thursday. Each team will play each other twice.
“In losing two games to a rival on the 
road with so many young players, it’s a good win. It’s a really quality win,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said following the finale. 
“We need to go 
back home, we need to regroup and there are a lot of things we need 
to improve on obviously.”
Florida outhit Miami 27-23 over the week-
end. Three UM home runs on Friday and a three-run home run by UM freshman Zack Collins were big difference-makers in UF’s two losses. For the Gators, seeing more of their 
freshmen on the field at Alex Rodriguez Park is something to build off of. 
Third baseman John Sternagel went 2 for 4 
in his first career start on Sunday. Left-hander Kirby Snead retired all four batters he faced on 
Friday and Sunday. 
Left-hander A.J. Puk earned the win after 
throwing 1.1 innings. 
Center fielder Buddy Reed saved bases 
all weekend, roaming the expansive outfield grass. Pete Alonso started at designated hit-ter and first base while from the fourth spot throughout the entire weekend. Florida kicks off three-team home tournament tonight

a run, 25-foot hurdle line 
into a roundoff, followed by 
a back handspring onto the 
horse. 
Once she blocks off the 
horse, she completes her 
challenging one-and-a-half 
twist onto the mat. 
She estimates all of this 
takes her about 20 seconds to complete. 
“For vault, definitely just 
been working on blocking it a lot higher and twisting a lot quicker so I can see the floor 
when I land,” Hunter said. 
“The spotting is a lot differ-ent than the full because I’m doing the extra half.” 
The rest of the Gators in 
the Florida lineup — exclud-ing Morgan Frazier — also perform a Yurchenko layout with a full twist for their 
vaults. Frazier performs a 
Yurchenko layout with a half twist, but the sophomore has not competed in any event so far this season. 
Frazier exhibitioned her 
vault once during her fresh-man campaign and scored a 9.475. 
Faehn believes the in-
creased difficulty of Hunt-er’s routine sets her apart from not just her teammates, but from most other NCAA 
gymnasts as well. 
“She’s doing a Yurchenko one and a half,” Faehn said. 
“There’s maybe only a hand-ful of gymnasts doing that 
collegiately simply because 
it’s more difficult and the risk involved because it’s a blind landing.”
Because of the increased 
visibility issue, Hunter fo-cuses on the floor throughout her entire vault routine. 
“What’s so different 
about my vault from every-one else’s is I definitely spot the floor the whole time,” Hunter said. 
In vault, deductions are 
taken for technical errors in how the gymnast approach-es the horse and after in the flight from the horse to the 
point of landing. 
More deductions come 
from the second category be-
cause that is where the gym-nasts are doing their flips 
and turns before attempting 
to stick a landing — another place where they could pos-sibly see a deduction. 
Hunter feels her toughest 
challenge competing vault is spotting the floor when she’s twisting off the horse and into her dismount. 
“When I run, I don’t think 
about it but once I hurdle into my round off all I think,” Hunter said. 
“All I say to myself is, 
‘Reach back, block and twist.’ Those are like the only three key words I give to myself.”Mattson proving versatile: 
Through eight games, Braden Matt-son has played catcher, first base, third base and right field. The trans-fer from San Jacinto community col-lege and Texas Christian has made 
O’Sullivan’s job easier.
Case in point: Mattson started 
Friday and Saturday at first base 
against Miami. 
Mattson moved to right field due 
to a double switch in the eighth in-ning of Game 2. He made his first start this season at catcher on Sun-day. 
His versatility and hot bat seem-
ingly assures him an everyday spot. At .429, he tops the Gators in batting 
average and ranks third with nine 
hits. 
He can also give Taylor Gushue a 
day off behind the plate and face left-handers at the plate when needed.
Gators searching for hitters: 
Gushue, the Gators’ premier mid-dle-of-the-order hitter, leads UF with one home run and nine RBIs. 
He erupted in Miami, going 6 for 12 
while mainly hitting right-handed. 
Florida had trouble finding con-
sistent offense throughout its order last year, especially with runners in 
scoring position.
Gushue finished first on the team 
with 33 RBIs in 2013. What’s the se-
cret?“It’s all about the mentality you 
have at the plate. Not putting too much pressure on yourself in pres-sure situations,” Gushue said two weeks before the season. “Last year, there were a lot of pressure situa-
tions. 
“This year I think it’ll be less 
(pressure situations), because we 
have more bats in the lineup. We 
have guys that can get it done from 
top to bottom.”

Despite a slow start, Florida 
bounced back to defeat Florida 
State in a 4-2 victory on Wednes-day at the Perry Indoor Tennis 
Facility in its first home match in 
almost a month. 
Maxx Lipman defeated FSU’s 
Michael  Rinaldi  6-2, 3-6, 6-2 to 
clinch the match for his team. 
“I’m really proud of both Mike 
Alford and Maxx Lipman for how they played down the stretch,” 
coach Bryan Shelton said in a re-
lease. 
“They played well. It was a 
good match and a match that will 
help us as we head into our [South-
eastern Conference] season.” 
Due to the rain, the match had 
to be played indoors. Despite the forecast, the Gators 
adjusted.
“We were playing indoors, 
so we knew it was going to be tough,” Shelton said. “FSU is a re-
ally good team and they came in 
with a lot of fight, and I was proud of how our guys competed from start to finish.” 
On the doubles court, Elliot Or-
kin and Gordon Watson defeated Marco Nunez and Grayson Gol-din 8-5. Stephane Piro and Mike Alford defeated No. 23 Dominic 
Cotrone and Blake Davis 8-6 to clinch the doubles point for the Gators. 
In singles, Spencer Newman 
and Diego Hidalgo were the 
only Florida players to lose their 
matches.  
Watson defeated Blake Davis 
(FSU) 6-2, 7-6 (3), while Florent 
Diep defeated Marco Nunez 4-6, 6-1, 6-4. 
To close out singles and clinch 
the match, Lipman fought in a highly contested match against Goldin and came out on top. 
Shelton knew it would be a 
tough day for the Gators, maybe tougher than he expected. 
With not much time to spare, 
Florida (5-4) will take a trip to 
College Station, Texas, where it 
will face Texas A&M on Friday at 6 p.m. Freshman clinches Florida’s

Mike Holloway looks on during the Southeastern Conference Cross Country Champion-
ships on Nov. 1, 2013, at the Mark Bostick Golf Course.
TRACK AND FIELD
LAWRENCE LAGUNA
Alligator Writer @LagunaLawrence 
Creating a track and ﬁ  eld program 
that is competitive in multiple events 
has been Mike Holloway’s goal since he arrived at Florida.
As UF’s coach for the past 12 years, 
Holloway had to re-direct the image of the team after it was deemed a sprint program. 
“I like to think that I learn from my 
mistakes,” Holloway said. “When we were basically a sprint team, we were successful, were top two in the country a lot, and we were second and third in the SEC a lot.
“But as a staff, we realized that we 
were going to be one of the best teams in the country or the best team in the league.”
Holloway said the team then had to 
be more diverse, and his staff went out to recruit top athletes in every event. 
His staff understood what it took to 
win in this league: You can’t do it in just 
one event or area. 
Then, they gathered the diversity that 
would give them ﬁ  ve national champi-
onships and scored equally on the ﬁ  eld and track events. 
With the 2014 Southeastern Confer-
ence Indoor Championships starting today, Holloway can direct his team again to a SEC Indoor title, which he has 
not won since the 2012 women’s team 
claimed the title.
The Columbus, Ohio, native, who is a 
UF alum, has also thrived on making the women’s program as elite as the men’s team. 
Holloway has preached to his female 
athletes that they have the talent to be as competitive as any team in the nation, but turning that talent into titles is what counts.
“The big thing with the women’s 
team is that they are starting to realize their potential,” Holloway said. 
“Potential is a funny word, because 
for me, it means we just haven’t done anything yet.”
Holloway said it’s time for the wom-
en’s side to take the next step and bring a trophy back to Gainesville. 
The crucial parts of the season per-
taining to Holloway are the SEC and  NCAA championships. 
With Florida always being in the dis-
cussion as a top team to win the confer-ence and nationals, Holloway also rec-ognizes there is solid competition in the SEC that can pose a threat. 
Top-ranked and defending indoor 
men’s champions Arkansas and third-ranked host Texas A&M will test Flor-ida. 
Although those teams seem to be 
rival competition, sophomore sprinter Arman Hall said whether in the regu-lar season or going into SECs, his team never takes it easy. 
When the second-ranked Gators take 
to the track once again in College Sta-tion, Texas, Hall said anyone who is on the track when Florida is competing would be a rival, not just one team. 
“Our competition never takes it easy 
on us,” Hall said. 
“We know we’re not the most liked 
team in NCAA, period. So everywhere we have to stay mentally ready, know-ing that they’re going to come out here to try to beat our bond, try to embarrass 
us on a national level. 
“So we got to make sure we do the 
same thing to them.”Well-rounded Gators starting SEC Championships today
