Cycling teams
race downtown
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Writer
About 260 cyclists went for a
ride around town this past week-
end at the 15th annual Swamp
Classic.
The two-day road race was
sponsored by UF's Team Flor-
ida bicycle club, the city of
Gainesville and local businesses,
and races were held for all ages
and skill levels.
"It's like a little moving cir-
cus," said Kenny Duffield, 21,
who came by to check out the
event. "It's different. I'm not used
to seeing bike culture like this."
Saturday, cyclists competed
in time trial races for individu-
als and teams in Archer. Sunday,
riders pedaled along a downtown
street course that circled South-
east 2nd Place and Southeast 2ndAvenue between Southeast 1st
and 7th streets.
Spectators gathered to cheer
on their friends and watch as the
pack rounded corners at speeds
up to 40 mph.
"It's like a little moving cir-
cus. It's different. I'm not
used to seeing bike culture
like this."

Phil Gaimon, a recent UF grad-
uate and coach for Team Florida,
took first in his professional-level
races, winning a total of $500 for
the weekend.
"It's a lot of hard work," Gai-
mon said. "It was pretty satisfy-
ing to end the weekend on that
note."Max Reed / Alligator

After getting a law degree from Har-
vard University, Hill Harper did what
any other young law school graduate
does -almost.
He got involved with theater, wrote
three books, acted in several films, and
for the past six years, he's played Dr.
Sheldon Hawkes on CSI: NY.
Harper will be speaking tonight at 8
in the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom.
The Accent show is cosponsored
by Black History Month and the Black
Graduate Student Organization, said
Jason Attermann, Accent chairman.
Harper will be paid $30,000, accord-
ing to the Student Government Finance
Office."I'm going to talk about courage
and fear and what stops people from
achieving their goals and dreams,"
Harper said.
He said he speaks to about 20,000
students across the country each year.
He said he uses these opportuni-
ties to encourage students to be "active
architects" in their lives, a term he will
explain during his talk.

in their lives and how to

Whether they want to get into act-

as fresh and unique.
He said it is not always easy, but the
most successful people in society bring

Students 'think pink' at party
By ALLYSON FOX
Alligator Contributing Writer
Pink shirts, pink plates, pink napkins
and even pink M&M's filled the Gainesville
Place clubhouse Friday night.
About 70 people went to the clubhouse
to play pool, sing karaoke and raise money
for Susan G. Komen for the Cure, a breast
cancer foundation dedicated to raising
money for research and promoting wom-
en's health.
About $500 was raised at the party.
The event was sponsored by the UF
chapter of Circle K International, a Kiwan-
is-affiliated college service and leadership
organization.
During the event, Michelle Gumz, a post-
doctoral assistant in the College of Medi-
cine's division of nephrology, shared the
story of her mother's fight against breast
cancer.
Gumz's mother died from breast cancer
in 2008, and Gumz said she was a tenacious
woman who was active in the community.
"She lost her hair but never missed a day
of work or lost her sense of humor," Gumz
said.
Gumz stressed the importance of raising
money and awareness about the disease.
Marsha Cohen, co-service chair of Circle
K, said she wanted to put on the event be-
cause of the high number of people who
have a connection to breast cancer. Danica Spears/ Alligator

Chinese new year

For the crowd of more than 1,000 who gathered Sunday
night in the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts, the
new year was just beginning.
The annual Chinese New Year Show, which was orga-
nized by the Friendship Association of Chinese Students
and Scholars, included 20 acts performed by UF students
and Gainesville residents.
Although the Chinese New Year begins February 14,
the show celebrated the fusion of Asian and American cul-
tures, with a performance of break dancing

Campus a traditional dance by students from the Hua-
Gen Chinese School in Gainesville.
Before the program began, Consul General Gao Yan-
ping from the Chinese embassy in Houston addressed the
audience and, switching back and forth from Mandarin to
English, spoke about this year's Chinese zodiac sign, the
tiger.
He said the tiger symbolizes strength, power, vitality
and productiveness.
UF Vice President and Provost Joseph Glover took the
stage after Yanping and talked about the significance of the
night's festivities for those far from home, specifically the
estimated 600 Chinese students at UF.
"We have a great stew of student cultures [at UFI,"
Glover said. "And I know that even across the globe we
can enrich each other."

When Don Marsh moved to Gainesville,
he baled hay for $25 a day and donated plas-
ma twice a week for extra cash.
That was nearly 30 years ago.
Now Marsh, owner of a window-cleaning
business, has a new challenge-running for
Gainesville mayor.
He unsuccessfully ran for the Alachua
County Commission in 2002, losing to Cynthia
Chestnut.
"I was a loose cannon," Marsh recalled.
Marsh runs against Craig Lowe, Richard
Selwach, Monica Leadon Cooper and Ozzy
Angulo for the office in City Hall.
"We all are underdogs to apathy," said
Marsh, who believes he will win if 20 to 25 per-
cent of voters head to the polls on March 16.
In 2007, during the city's last mayoral race,
only 10.73 percent of eligible voters cast a bal-
lot, according to the Alachua County Supervi-
sor of Elections Web site.
According to the lastest campaign finance
reports, Marsh has raised $1,820.
Marsh said he would like to get local

"Churches are all about accountability.
Whatever religious group is in favor of doing
good, I'm in favor of," he said.
He also plans to revise the city's anti-dis-
crimination ordinance, which amends Chap-
ter 8 of the city Code of Ordinances to include
protection from gender discrimination.
The ordinance allows citizens to use bath-
rooms that suit their gender identity, defined
as "an inner sense of being a specific gender"
as opposed to biological sex.
Marsh believes the ordinance is too broad
and could open the door to sexual predators
taking advantage of the provision.
The solution would be toLocal have transgender people acquire
News doctor confirmation, he said.
Marsh said he got the idea when
current Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan discussed
how people undergoing gender transforma-
tion visited doctors to help with the process.
"If a pedophile doesn't have doctor's or-
ders, his ass is going to jail," he said.
Although he remained optimistic about
his chances in the race, Marsh insisted that
he does not see the race as a stepping stone to
higher offices down the road.
"I'm here to serve the people for two
terms and get out," he said ."I'm not go-

Valentine's singers
serenade students
0 THE GROUP MADE MORE
THAN $2,000 LAST YEAR.
By ERIN JESTER
Alligator ContributingWriter
This Valentine's Day, the broth-
ers of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, an
honorary music fraternity for men,
want students to give the gift of
song.
The Sinfonians travel in groups
of about 12 and perform a cappella
renditions of popular and classic
love songs.
Pricing starts at $40 Feb. 12 and
13 and increases by $5 for appoint-
ments between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m.
on Feb. 14. There will be a $5 stu-
dent discount.
"We're twice as good but half
the price of a barbershop quartet,"
said Joe Uong, an anthropology se-
nior and Phi Mu Alpha member.
Curtis Viselli, the group's mu-
sical director, said the Valentine's
Day serenades have been in-
grained in the fraternity's tradition
for several years.
"It's a really big part of what we
do," said Viselli, a music and phys-
ics junior. "Singing is the thing that
we all do together."Although the Sinfonians per-
form in the Music Building every
week, Valentine's Day is their big
event, Viselli said.
Last year, the fraternity made
more than $2,000 by performing
all around the city and showing
up at dorms, classrooms and res-
taurants.
"We went to the woods one
time," Viselli said. "We'll go any-
where [in Gainesville]."
Fraternity members gathered
in front of the Reitz Union between
passes Wednesday to advertise
the serenades by performing songs
from their repertoire, including
"my Girl," "Happy
Ofn Together," "Stand
Campus By Me" and the fra-
ternity's signature
tune, "A Serenade to a Girl."
Danielle Davis, a freshman,
was surprised when the Sinfo-
nians personally serenaded her as
she was passing by.
"I think that people will like
that," she said. "I definitely en-
joyed it."
The Sinfonians are available for
hire Feb. 12 through 14. Packages
include three songs and a rose.

Do Ask, Do Tell
America should end
military discriminationOn Sunday, military newspapers released the results
of a survey that revealed a sharp decrease in the
number of active-duty troops who oppose people
who are openly gay and serving.
And with recent statements from Republicans and mili-
tary officials, it has become clear how most people feel:
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" is cruel and unnecessary.
So the Editorial Board has one question: When will we
finally get rid of it?
President Obama announced during his State of the
Union address that he would work with Congress this
year to appeal it.
We appreciate the promise, but it's important that "this
year" doesn't turn into "whenever."
That means Americans can't listen to professional nay-
sayers like Rep. John Boehner, who hides his bigotry be-
hind the "there are more important things to deal with"
shield.
People who practice fundamentalism, witchcraft, Satan-
ism and white supremacy -all of which are choices made
by their observers -serve openly in the U.S. military.
But gay soldiers, who have about the same control over
their sexuality as the Editorial Board has over the color of
its members' eyes, have to keep their mouths shut.
"Don't Ask, Don't Tell" teaches men and women in the
service and Americans as a whole that being gay or lesbian
is something to be ashamed of, but as long as the policy is
intact, the only thing we should be ashamed of is living in
the country that won't stand up and defeat it.
Sex Ed
he Editorial Boardwould like to offer
bit of advice for all
of you aspiring politicians
out there: Don't make a sex
tape, OK?
Now, this may seem like
common sense, but this bit
of advice never seemed to
reach former Democratic
presidential candidate John
Edwards.
News of a sex tape star-
ring his former mistress
-you know, the mother
of the kid he's been deny-
ing paternity of for the past
two years -came out last
week.
And now that we're
thinking about it, the Edito-
rial Board would like to ex-
tend its advice to everyone.
It is never a good idea to
make a sex tape -never.
Because it'll always come
back and haunt you.
Don't believe us? Ask
any of the Kardashian sis-ters, Verne Troyer (more
commonly known as Mini
Me) or even scary female
wrestler Chyna.
The Disney Channel's
Vanessa Hudgens even fell
victim to this -well, sort
of -when she had naked
pictures posted on the In-
ternet.
She almost got kicked
off the cast of "High School
Musical." Can we all please
take a moment to think
about how sad that would
have been?
We get it -celebri-
ties usually end up more
famous than before, but
we're sick and tired of you
making these poor deci-
sions and then being sur-
prised or upset when the
tape inevitably ends up on
the Internet.
So why don't all of you
invest in some ceiling mir-
rors and put the camcorder
away?

ell, it finally happened. I suppose it was only a mat-ter of time before one of White House Chief of Staff
Rahm Emanuel's well-rumored, profanity-laced
harangues would surface while he was in office. Indeed, it
was only a snippet of his Chicago-sharpened talent, but it
was worth the wait.
Apparently, in a meeting this past summer concering
plans for Democrat-on-Democrat attacks over the health care
bill, Emanuel referred to the idea of such measures as "fuck-
ing retarded." Awesome. His statement's bold, brutal, South
Philly-esque candor in contrast with the established deco-
rum of his administrative position achieves a monumental
horse-head-in-silk-sheets-level juxtaposition.
Naturally, every P.C.-touting paladin came out of the
woodwork, chiding Emanuel for his insensitivity, inappro-
priateness, offensiveness, etc., and among them, of course,
was The Pitbull. It should come as no surprise that Sarah
Palin chose to speak out on the matter, her special interest
stemming from her son Trig Palin having Down syndrome.
In fact, she called for President Obama to fire Emanuel over
the issue, stating the phrase was equivalent to that of a racial
slur. Well, let me save Emanuel some time in responding by
saying that Palin's line of reasoning is "fucking retarded."
Had Emanuel characterized the aforementioned group's
constituency by garbling his words and pounding his chest
with his hand or noted the irony of Palin naming her son
after a branch of mathematics, the offended groups and Palin
would have had something to shake their fists at, as those ac-
tions would be, and are, distasteful.
Palin's comparison of "fucking retarded" to a racial slur is
absurd. The phrase, as I implied above, is a general referent,
not a personal one, so her likening is off-base from the get-
go. Even if Emanuel described the group as "retards," the
disparity in the magnitudes of her comparison's components
still remains. The kind of malignant mentality a racial slur is
indicative of emphasizes the historically universal and still-
pervasive shortcomings of social perception, the victims andRyan Spencer
letters@alligator orginjustices of which being prevalent to
such an extent as to render the intel-
lectual prejudice Palin has in mind as
merely inconsiderate and unfair.
In this very sense, Palin's call to
oust Emanuel makes a mountain of a
mole hill. But still, why the fervor? I
believe it's simply Emanuel's irascible
reputation being in the public mind
combined with Palin's proneness for
being wantonly inconsistent. (Now, if there was some way to
provide evidence for my theory and also introduce it with a
completely ridiculous statement.)
Luckily, Rush Limbaugh decided to speak up. Last week,
he purposely misquoted Emanuel several times in an effort
to disparage the concerned groups' members, calling an up-
coming meeting between them and Obama a "retard sum-
mit." It was a thinly veiled attempt to take some cheap shots
and perhaps push Palin's buttons. She evaded immediate
response, relying on her spokesperson to indirectly refer to
Limbaugh's comments as "crude and demeaning." She ap-
peared on "Fox News Sunday" to backtrack her non-criti-
cisms of Limbaugh by excusing his usage of "retard" as be-
ing purely satirical. You betcha, and so was my "trig" joke.
Furthermore, to make her inconsistency even more un-
bearably evident, I'd like to ask where Palin was last month
when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's "Negro dialect"
quote surfaced? She literally could have used the same exact
argument she had against Emanuel, albeit in a different, if
more appropriate, manner.
It seems Palin has definitively identified herself as less of
champion and more of a charlatan. And as for Emanuel, if
people wanted to get on his case for anything, it should only
have been for being vulgar. But, then again, we already knew
that, didn't we?

Columns full of rambling
I'm getting a little tired of Paul
Murty's column. I was bemused
by -if not OK with- his argu-
ment that we should do away with
guns. I'm a little less OK with his
ignorant generalization of the Tea
Party movement. And while I think
Tea Partiers are all crazies, I don't
stand on a podium and spout my
ignorance of their cause. I really
don't care if the opinions section is
inflammatory, inspiring, sweet, hor-
rendously offensive or boring, but
please demand that thought be put
into the opinion, otherwise it just
becomes ignorant rambling. And
I'd rather have one of those terribly
boring sexToons than more ignorant
rambling.

Columnist lacks original ideas
The new Friday columnist, Paul
Murty, is absolutely horrible. He
doesn't have any original ideas, and
it's pretty obvious he doesn't actu-
ally research his articles past Wiki-
pedia. The economy is not well on
its way to recovery. He talks about
the preachers on Turlington Plaza as
if it's breaking news and then the is-
sue of gun control as if he knows ev-
erything, when actually he offered
no ideas of his own whatsoever. At
least last week's column, "Modem
Tea Party is deeply flawed," was
relevant to today. Could he write
something that isn't dripping with
disdain for anything Republican?

Technological advances like Facebook more
here's this new thing out that's prettyfantastic.
It's called "Facebook." Oh, you've
heard of it? Interesting.
Then you must know how much it helps
your research skills.
That's right. If you thought all your
Facebook stalking was simply you being
a little bit creepy, you've missed the best
part.
Here's how it works. Back in the day, if
you wanted to learn information about a
person, you had to talk to people.
Want to know if your coworker is sin-
gle?
You'd better have a base of friends at
work to discreetly inquire about her rela-
tionship status.
Want to know who a person's friends
are?
You need to know people who can tell
you.
There was a split: talk to people for
things about people, go to the card catalog
in the library for everything else.
And let's face it, people care about peo-
ple a lot more than they care about plantbiology or the history of Madagascar.
So people's skills at getting information
interpersonally would progress, while
their ability to research facts would-
well, let's just say it would never become
a strong point.
Enter Facebook stalking. On the Inter-
net, learning is learning.
It takes skills to find things out, but they
are the same kind of skills for people and
for information.
Delving into those Wikipedia links on a
topic is really similar to reading the latest
Apple rumors.
And consider finding out about that co-
worker.
She doesn't have a "relationship status"
listed, so that could be good or bad.
Out of her 87 profile pics, none of them
are with a guy.
She's way too cute not to have dated
somebody, so she must have purged her
boyfriend-y pictures. Maybe she's single,
then.
There aren't any incriminating wall
posts, just a lot of back-and-forth with a
Filipe from Peru.Will Penman
Speaking OutAn ethnic boy-
friend? He's pretty
overt about the pur-
suit if that's the case.
They should really
switch over to mes-
sages.
Oh, there it is. An
inconspicuous com-
ment on a photo from a party two weeks
ago: "haha can't wait to see you and your
boo next weekend!" says Sarah Adams.
Sigh. Better luck next time.
The principle extends beyond Facebook
usage, of course.
Spelling is the domain of Firefox's little
red corrections, grammar is a comparative
Google search, and bibliographies are a
fill-in-the-blank effort on some websites.
It all goes to show that the distinction be-
tween work and fun is blurring.
In fact, I've gotten confused before
about whether I was researching or wast-
ing time.
Tell me a situation like this hasn't hap-
pened to you.
You're in a German class where youthan just fun
have to do projects.
This week's writing assignment is on
Konrad Adenauer, the first Chancellor of
West Germany after World War II.
You pull up the Wikipedia page on him
(in English and German), have a tab for
Google image results, a tab for general In-
ternet search results, and yet another tab
or two for additional random, interesting
sites.
And then you start digesting Adenau-
er.
Ten minutes later, you say to yourself,
"Wow, I've been stalking the shit out of
this guy. I should really get to work."
Then you remember that Adenauer is a
historical figure, not your friend, and that
you're almost finished with your project.
So in conclusion, don't hesitate to get
your stalk on.
Because I think it's basically going to
give us all A's for the rest of the semester.
I mean, Facebook founder Mark Zuck-
erberg went to Harvard, and look what
Facebook's done for him.

UF climbs Peace
Corps rankings
By ERICA COOK
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF jumped 11 spots to rank fifth in the nation for the
number of Peace Corps volunteers it produces.
UF has 79 undergraduate alumni serving in the Peace
Corps, according to the Peace Corps Top Colleges 2010
listing.
The University of Washington ranked first with 101
volunteers.
"It's a big deal for the South," said Amy Panikowski,
UF campus recruiter. "There has never been a university
in the south that has been in the top 10, and now we are
in the top five."
Panikowski said she owes this year's recruiting success
to the connections between former UF Peace Corps volun-
teers and applicants.
She said former UF Peace Corps volunteers create
connections with applicants and give them
On a realistic view of what the Peace Corps in-
Campus volves.
"I don't want to give them an over-roman-
ticized view, but I do want them to get a real perspective
of what they are getting into," she said.
UF alumni Emily New and John Washington have
been dating since their days at Eastside High School in
Gainesville, and they will be abroad serving in the Peace
Corps for the next two years.
New will be working in the Republic of Georgia and
Washington will be serving in Botswana. The two plan
to maintain their five-year relationship regardless of the
distance.
"We stayed together all through college," Washington
said. "We will write to each other and try to meet some-
time in between."
"It's an accomplishment, and I have a lot of people
who help me out," Panikowski said. "I have my own in-
terns who help me with advertising and promotions; re-
turning volunteers are also very helpful and share their
experience."

Event shares ideas, creativity
By BRITT PERKINS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Technology, entertainment
and design came together for
ideas worth sharing at UF's first
TEDx event Saturday afternoon."The whole focus of TED is to
bring different thought leaders
together across the disciplines to
engage with each other and share
their ideas," said event coordina-
tor Meaghan Barbin. "Interactiv-
ity is a huge aspect."
'UF
Maria Farias / Alligator
Theater and dance professor Joan Frosch speaks at TEDx in Pugh
Hall Saturday. Frosch spoke about her experiences in Africa.TED is an internationally ac-
tive nonprofit that originally
brought together professionals
from the fields of technology, en-
tertainment and design and has
since expanded to include many
other fields. The "x" stands for
independently organized.
Ambassadors of the Center for
Entrepreneurship and Innovation
hosted the event in Pugh Hall.
About 70 people attended.
"We have one of the best pools
of talent here at UF," said UF
graduate Abhi Lokesh, an entre-
preneur at the event. "It would
be remiss of us not to tap into
that creative pool."
Jessica Guyton, a UF health
sciences senior, said she enjoys
TED events.
"Stuff we don't care about,
they bring pieces you can incor-
porate in your own life no matter
what your interests are," Guy-
ton said. "That's what it's about:
bringing two different things to-
gether."
Guests included entomol-
ogy professor Carl Barfield, as-
sistant jazz professor Scott Wil-
son, dance professor Joan Frosch,
distinguished service professor
Sanford Berg, husband-wife team
Miriam Zach, a musicologist, and
Mikesch Muecke, an architect,
and astronomy professor Charles
Telesco.
Barbin said the ambassadors
will host TEDx events annually
at UF.
"I think it's going to be a lot
easier going forward to have this
event on a regular basis," Barbin
said, "because people now recog-
nize and have seen the faces of
the other people around UF who
want to make themselves better,
who want to learn more about
a wide range of topics and who
want to make a change."

Macklin leads UF past Miss. St.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
With one of the best big men in
the Southeastern Conference com-
ig to Gainesville, no one expected
Vernon Macklin to play the best
game of his career at Florida.
But Macklin outplayed Missis-
sippi State center Jarvis Varnado,
scoring a career-high 20 points on
10-of-14 shooting and grabbing
six rebounds as UF (17-6, 6-3 SEC)
topped MSU (16-7,4-4 SEC) 69-62 in
the O'Connell Center on Saturday.
Macklin went right at the na-
tion's second-leading shot blocker
throughout the game, establishing
position down low, hitting his baby
hook shot and throwing down a few
dunks against Varnado.
"He (Macklin) played great
today. I was waiting for this
breakout game for him."
Alex Tyus
UF junior power forward
"(UF coach Billy Donovan)
wanted us to go right at (Varna-
do's) chest," Macklin said. "Don't
be scared to go in there and make
tough shots. He's going to make you
alter a lot of shots, but you've just
got to keep going at him."
Varnado, who was averaging 5.2
blocks per game before Saturday,
scored 16 points but needed 16 shots
to do so, and he only recorded one
block in 32 minutes of play.
Donovan encouraged Macklin
before the game to not be intimidat-
ed by Varnado, as going up weakly
against such a ferocious shot blocker
would play right into his strength.
"The worst thing to do against a
shot blocker is to go away from him,
because now the guy has no contact
and can jump up," Donovan said. "I
thought Vernon, if he could get the
ball in there, could do some things
against him."
Instead, Macklin had to "do his
work early," Donovan said, by get-
ting position inside and creating an
angle to score -something he has
often struggled to do this season.
"That's actually the game plan
with a lot of the bigs, but sometimes
I don't do a great job of doing it,"
Macklin said. "Coach keeps telling
me all the time to do it every game,
so this game I came out and tried my
hardest to do it."
The 6-foot-10 center shot just 3 of
7 in the first half, but Macklin keptHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF center Vernon Macklin scored a career-high 20 points in the
Gators' 69-62 win over Mississippi State on Saturday.
Varnado quiet on defense until 2:31
remained before intermission. Var-
nado scored five points and got his
first block of the game during that
stretch.
Macklin came out strong after
halftime, scoring the Gators' first 10
points and shooting a perfect 7 for 7
in the second half.
"He did a great job of passing out
when they started double-teaming
him," junior power forward Alex
Tyus said. "His jump hook's always
there. I feel like we need to do a bet-
ter job of trying to make more of an
effort to get him the ball.
"He played great today. I was
waiting for this breakout game for
him."Macklin's output was needed
given the lackluster offensive per-
formances by Tyus, Kenny Boynton
and Erving Walker. UF's top-three
scorers entering the game combined
for 21 points on 7-of-35 shooting.
But Macklin and junior forward
Chandler Parsons picked up the
slack. Parsons filled up the stat sheet
with 18 points on 5-of-8 shooting, 12
rebounds, six assists and two steals.
"That shows how good our team
is," Parsons said. "We don't have to
make shots to win. We can play de-
fense, we can go inside, we can go
outside. Some guys aren't going to
have perfect games every night -
they're not going to shoot the ball
well."Jones clinches win
with free throws
* THE GATORS EDGED MISSISSIPPI STATE 80-78
IN DOUBLE OVERTIME.
By TYLER JETT

tjett@alligator org
Jordan Jones stood at the free-throw line, the whole
game dependent on how she would perform in the com-
ing moments.
With only 2 seconds left in the second overtime of a
game tied at 78, Jones drove into the
lane, where she was fouled by Missis-
sippi State's Alexis Rack.
Before taking the two momentousWomen's shots, Jones thought of teammate Azania
BaSketball Stewart, who tells herself as she walks to
the free-throw line that the other team is
foolish for giving up a guaranteed two points.
The confidence worked.
"I knew they were going in as soon as they left my
hand," Jones said of the free throws.
Sure enough, both shots found the net. Senior Steffi
Sorensen intercepted the ensuing inbounds pass, sealing
Florida's 80-78 victory Sunday in the O'Connell Center.

UF rebounds from 12 down in second half
WHOOPS, from page 14
In the Gators' previous game,
a 66-58 loss to Vanderbilt, Jones
shot 1 for 4 from the charity
stripe. UF coach Amanda Butler
said she got in Jones' ear after
that game, and Jones responded
with a perfect 11-for-11 perfor-
mance on free throws Sunday.
"There was a different look
in Jordan's eye (Sunday), and it
was confidence," Butler said.
Jones led Florida (13-10, 6-4
Southeastern Conference) with
21 points, while Sorensen and
senior Lonnika Thompson add-
ed 12 points and 11 points, re-
spectively.
"There was a different
look in Jordan's eye (Sun-
day), and it was confi-
dence."
Amanda Butler
UF women's basketball coach
To give Jones a chance to be
a hero, UF had to make up for a
sluggish start to the second half.
After trailing by one at the inter-
mission, Mississippi State (15-9,
6-5 SEC) began the second half
on a 19-6 run.
The Gators struggled to con-
tain the 6-foot-5 Chanel Mokan-
go, who led all scorers with 22
points.
During the Bulldogs' run, the
Gators gave up easy, often un-
contested baskets in the paint.
Down 52-40, Butler took a
timeout with 12 minutes left,
and UF seized momentum.

made clutch baskets inside the
lane with less than two minutes
left to force overtime.
Once overtime began, an un-
likely star emerged for Florida.
Point guard Lonnika Thompson
scored all nine of UF's points in
the first overtime. In the game's
previous 40 minutes, Thompson
was scoreless.
"Hitting (my first) layup felt
good," she said. "My teammates
were like, 'Ok, L is back."'Facing a bigger team, Butler
decided to change the defense
throughout the game in an at-
tempt to confuse Mississippi
State.
"We did a really good job
going between man and zone,
throwing traps out there," But-
ler said. "I thought we kept
playing very, very well. I think
that, as much as anything, had
an impact on how they shot the
ball."BOBBY, from page 14
He started the last five
games of his freshman year
and should continue that
streak next season. Matt
Patchan was battling for time
at this spot before a torn ACL
ended his season, so he could
push Nixon for the position.
Left guard: Carl Johnson
Johnson started every
game last year and made the
move to guard when Nixon
assumed the starting job at
tackle.
Center: Mike Pouncey
With his brother jumping
to the NFL, he will slide over
to Maurkice's old spot.
Right guard: Nick Alaja-
jian
Although veterans Mo
Hurt and James Wilson each
started some games last sea-
son, neither impressed the
coaches enough to hold down
a job while Alajajian and Jon
Halapio were lauded for their
first years.
Right tackle: Marcus Gil-
bert
He started every game in
2009 and will not be unseated
from the starting job.
Defensive end: Justin
Trattou and Ronald Powell
Trattou is the only sure
thing at the position, and Pow-
ell will be going against Duke
Lemmons and William Green
for the other starting job. But
the five-star recruit will be too
talented to keep off the field.
Def ensive tackle: Jay
Howard and Omar Hunter
The starting title will notmean much as this will be a
rotating door with Lawrence
Marsh, Brandon Antwine and
Gary Brown coming in often.
Freshmen Sharrif Floyd and
Dominique Easley could also
earn playing time.
Strong-side linebacker:
A.J. Jones
Jones was one of the big-
gest surprises of 2009 but will
still need to hold off Brandon
Hicks to be the starter in 2010.
Middle linebacker: Jon
Bostic
He only has to beat out in-
jury-plagued Brendan Beal.
Weakside linebacker:
Jelani Jenkins
This job is wide open and
whoever fills it will need to
put on weight. Hicks could
switch over from strong side
if needed.
Cornerback: Janoris Jen-
kins and Josh Shaw
Jenkins has started almost
every game for the previous
two seasons, and Shaw is the
best cornerback of the loaded
2010 class. He will be going
up against Jeremy Brown and
Adrian Bushell for the job op-
posite of Jenkins.
Strong safety: Ahmad
Black
He has been a staple on the
defense the last two years and
won't be challenged next sea-
son.
Free safety: Will Hill
He has been the third safe-
ty since he arrived on campus
but must still hold off Dee Fin-
ley.

UF GYMNASTICS
Gators top 'Pack
for fourth-straight
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
Florida got off to a strong start on the uneven bars Fri-
day night against N.C. State and used it to propel the team
to its fourth-consecutive victory, 195.475-194.450.
The Gators registered the five best bar scores of the meet,
including a pair of 9.85s by senior Amanda Castillo and
freshman Marissa King, who both won their first events of
the season.
"I've never really considered myself a bar worker," King
said. "But to get my first win there is encouraging."
The quick start on bars helped No. 3 Florida (4-1, 3-0
Southeastern Conference) jump out to an early .700-point
lead after one rotation, which was enough to hold off No.
22 N.C. State (3-2) in Raleigh, N.C.
"We hit on our handstands, and the aggressiveness was
there on bars," UF coach Rhonda Faehn said. "We carried
that momentum moving forward in the meet and had an
awesome vault as well."
"We were all a bit shocked because we've
never seen [freshman Ashande Dickerson] do
that. She is human, though."
Rhonda Faehn
UF gymnastics coach
The Gators implemented changes to the lineup and a
few routines against the Wolfpack, hoping to put together
a higher team total.
A couple of those changes paid dividends Friday night,
as sophomore Elizabeth Mahlich improved her bar score
with a 9.80, and King tallied another 9.775 on balance
beam, which Faehn said was King's best performance of
the season.
Freshman Randy Stageberg also recorded a 9.80 in her
return to floor exercises after missing last week's LSU meet
due to an illness.
Not all of the tweaking Florida did to its routines paid
off, though. Freshman Ashan6e Dickerson scored a 9.20 on
bars after missing on one of her release moves.
"We were all a bit shocked because we've never seen
her do that," Faehn said. "She is human, though."
The meet marked the first time this year Dickerson did
not finished in the top two in the all-around.
Instead, N.C. State's Brooke Barr took home the all-
around title with a 38.925 and King was second with a
38.850.
Freshman Liz Green also took home her third-straight
beam title with a 9.825.UF shuffles roster, shuts out Troy
0 THE GATORS' WOMEN
HAVE WON 71-STRAIGHT
MATCHES AT HOME.
By ANDREW OLSON
Alligator Writer
The lineup was different, but
the result was familiar.
The No. 7 Gators (5-0) featured
a new doubles lineup at the No. 3
spot, and moved singles players
No. 2-6 all up one court to make
room for freshman Brittany Bor-
sanyi at the No. 6 spot, in their
7-0 win over Troy on Sunday.
No. 15 freshman Lauren Em-
bree, who usually plays on the
first court, did not play.
UF women's coach Roland
Thornqvist said the decision was
about letting everyone get play-
ing time on a team with such
depth.
In singles, Embree was re-
placed by No. 13 freshman Allie
Will at the No. 1 spot.
Freshman Caroline Hitimana
played at the No. 2 position in
doubles with senior Anastasia
Revzina, who usually partners
with Embree.
Hitimana and Revzina had no
trouble winning their set 8-2 to
clinch the doubles point.
Will did not stumble in her
first time at No. 1 as she won in
straight sets 6-4, 6-1.
"I told Allie, any time you're
at No. 1 wearing that Florida jer-
sey, you're going to get their best
shot," Thornqvist said. "Whoever
you face is going to play like they
have nothing to lose against the
Gators."
The Southeastern Conference
Freshman of the Week thought
she could have performed better
despite the results.
"It was a good experience,
even if I didn't play my best ten-
nis," Will said. "I had my team-
mates' support and I felt I played
a much better second set after the
nerves settled."
Borsanyi did not lose a set in
her debut. She and sophomore
Claire Bartlett won their doubles
set 8-6. They were the last of the
three doubles teams to finish."When you're the third team
to finish you have the attention of
the whole stadium," Thornqvist
said. "That's something you
can't prepare for in practice."
In singles play, Borsanyi won
in straight sets 6-0, 6-4.
UF's home match winning
streak is now 71.
With the four-day ITA Team
Indoor Championships starting
Friday in Madison, Wis., Florida
perhaps gets its best test today
when they host USF at 3 p.m.
"They have the best one
through six lineup we've faced so
far," Thornqvist said.USF has shown a tendency to
play up to in-state competition.
The Bulls beat No. 21 FSU 5-2 on
Jan. 23 in Tallahassee.
The men's team easily defeat-
ed FAU 7-0 on Saturday.
It gave the men's team one last
chance to gain court experience
before the Gators (4-1) head to
Charlottesville, Va., for the quar-
terfinals of the ITA Indoor Cham-
pionships.
Only two of the matches Sat-
urday did not end in straight sets
with freshmen Sekou Bangoura
Jr. and Billy Federhofer both
needing a tiebreaker.

Florida shows off talented roster at Virginia Tech Invitational
The Gators took first place in seven events
By RYAN BUTLER
Alligator Writer
One of the UF men's and women's track
and field teams' greatest strengths are
their depth, and they showed that to some
of the elite teams in the Southeastern and
Atlantic Coast Conferences this weekend.
The Gators won seven events and land-
ed four automatic and 12 provisional qual-
ifying times in this weekend's Virginia
Tech Invitational.
With its distance team home for the
weekend, UF won events in throws, jumpsand sprints.
"Our goal is always to have a well-bal-
anced team so one event doesn't have all
the pressure on them," head coach Mike
Holloway said.
Senior Shara Proctor put in the most
impressive performance of the week-
end, landing the second-best women's
long jump in the world this season. Her
6.67m/21-10.75 was the 12th-best colle-
giate jump of all time.
She also qualified for the NCAAs in the
triple jump with her 13.88m/45-6.50.
Fellow jumper Christian Taylor post-ed a 16.26m/53-4.25 in the triple jump to
qualify for the NCAA finals after winning
the event in the championship meet last
season.
Shot putter Mariam Kevkhishvili con-
tinued her great season,
breaking her own school
record with a throw of
18.56m/60-10.75.Track It was her 10th-straight
win in an indoor competi-
tion and was the third-best throw in col-
legiate history.
On the men's side, junior Kemal Mesic
recorded one of the top six throws in the
nation. His 18.99m/62-3.75 throw allowed
him to finish first in the meet and hold thefourth-best distance in UF history.
A pair of freshmen sprinters for the
Gators also put in strong performances.
On the women's side, Lanie Whittaker
won the 400-meter dash in 54.06. Tony
McQuay finished second in the men's 400
with a time of 46.90.
In his first meet of the season, Jeff
Demps qualified first in the preliminaries
of the 60 with a 6.64, .04 seconds off an
NCAA Championship automatic qualify-
ing time.
Demps ran a 6.61 in the finals to fin-
ish second while football teammate Chris
Rainey improved from a 6.74 in the pre-
lims to a 6.70 in the finals, good for fourth
place.
