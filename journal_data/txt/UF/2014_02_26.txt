UF music junior David 
Vega entered the university 
with the hopes of pursuing a career in the medical ﬁ  eld to become the pediatrician he al-
ways wanted to be.
Even though he is a non-
science major, Vega, 21, has 
taken the necessary prerequi-site courses at UF to prepare him for medical school. But other nonscience students may not have had the op-portunity to take the required 
classes or may have changed 
their career choices entirely.
“It’s hard to know when 
you’re going to college what exactly you want to study and do for the rest of your life,” Vega said.
In response, UF is launch-
ing a new program called the College of Liberal Arts & Sciences Pre-Health and Post-Baccalaureate Program, which allows graduates to take the prerequisite courses necessary to apply to health professional graduate pro-grams such as medical or 
dental school.
“The college saw that that 
need was there, and so we 
wanted to create something that could help fulﬁ  ll that need,” said Christine Rich-mond, an academic adviser for the college and one of the administrators for the pro-
gram.
Students who have always 
wanted to attend UF for pre-
health courses will have the opportunity to do so with the program, she said.

The legal drinking age could have tan-
gible consequences of reducing trafﬁ  c acci-
dents, suicide and assault.
That’s what the ﬁ  ndings of a study by 
two Boston University School of Public 
Health researchers showed. A review was published Monday by the Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs. 
The research, collected since 2006, indi-
cated that the age-21 drinking laws are as-
sociated with lower rates of drunken driv-ing accidents and other dangers of excessive drinking, including suicide, sexual assault and unprotected sex, according to the re-view.
UF College of Medicine professor Alex 
Wagenaar said there is no question that keeping the drinking age at 21 causes fewer drunken driving accidents.“It doesn’t solve the 
problem completely, but it has a signiﬁ  cant effect,” he said.
Wagenaar has re-
searched the effects of al-cohol for many years. He 
wrote a book called “Al-cohol, Young Drivers, and Trafﬁ  c Accidents: Effects 
of Minimum-age Laws,” in 1983, when the question of whether to lower the drinking age was being discussed.Wagenaar said he thinks the scientiﬁ  c 
research speaks for itself in showing the re-alistic positives of keeping the drinking age at 21, and it’s unlikely that the drinking age will be lowered any time soon.
“People don’t want to deal with more 
teenagers dying,” he said.
About 10,000 car crashes where alcohol 
was the leading cause were reported in 2012, according to Florida Department of Trans-
portation data. Statewide, 25 fatal, alcohol-

Fraternities and sororities geared toward 
LGBT students have been founding new 
chapters at universities around the country, leading some to question whether a chapter could be founded at UF.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said any group could be a registered organization on campus as long as it adheres to the nondis-crimination language that exists at UF.
“Putting together or founding an LGBT 
Greek letter organization would not be dif-ﬁ  cult,” she said.
The only way an LGBT fraternity or so-
rority can join one of the four social Greek councils is if the chapter is chartered by a national organization.
Two of the most prominently LGBT-
friendly Greek organizations, Delta Lamb-da Phi and Gamma Rho Lambda, state on their websites their aim to be accepting of any person, regardless of sexual orientation 
and are not exclusively for LGBT students.
LB Hannahs, the director of LGBT af-
fairs at UF, said Hannahs has not been 
approached by any LGBT students at UF interested in starting a chapter but thinks it could be a beneﬁ  cial addition for those interested.“There are a number of LGBT folks that 
wish to be in a Greek organization, but the gender rules or climate in the Greek com-munity aren’t always accepting to them,” Hannahs said. 
An LGBT fraternity or sorority could 
beneﬁ  t the Greek community by providing a voice within the Greek community, Han-nahs said.
However, Hannahs said the new organi-
zation could face challenges from the tradi-

Sarah Lambert can ignore her phone for 
14 hours and 8 minutes, which means she 
may be saving lives as the seconds are lost.
UF students are making a difference by 
giving their thumbs a break with a new ad-
dition to the UNICEF Tap Project, a nation-
wide campaign that provides clean water to children in more than 100 countries.
For every 10 minutes a user goes without 
using his or her mobile device while unicef-tapproject.org is open in a browser window, one of UNICEF’s sponsors will provide a day’s worth of water. The project will run until March 31.
Lambert, the treasurer of Gators for UNI-
CEF, said she’s always on her phone because of on-campus involvement, but she’s been cutting down since the project began in mid-February.
“It’s really nice that you can make a dif-
ference because literally all you have to do is not touch your phone,” said the 20-year-old UF Spanish and linguistics junior. 
Rachael Swanson Mizuno, UNICEF di-
rector of volunteer and community partner-ships, wrote in an email that although this is the project’s eighth year, it is the ﬁ  rst time the organization introduced the website.
“The UNICEF Tap Project mobile web 
app (is) a way to reﬂ  ect on what it means to be without water by giving up access to something far less vital — your cell phone,” 
she wrote. 
Gators for UNICEF secretary Karla 
Aguayo, a 21-year-old UF anthropology 
junior, works at La Nopalera Mexican Res-taurant and said she sees tables of families zoned out on cellphones.
“It just kind of stinks,” she said. “The 
world is really changing into just everything being technology.”
While UF students worry about getting 
Starbucks in the morning, she said, chil-dren in other countries worry about making 
enough money to feed their families.
Lambert said many children also have to 
decide whether to drink the water they have 
access to.
“Either they die from dehydration be-
cause they can’t drink the water, or they die from diseases that are carried in the water,” she said. 
Students often want to improve the world 
but don’t know where to start, Lambert said, but campaigns like this make it easy.
“It takes so little to help people out some-
times that we all have a responsibility to do so,” she said.  Gators give up cellphones to 
help provide clean water
Clean water facts from UNICEF
1. About 1,400 children die daily from dis-
eases related to unsanitary drinking and 
sewage conditions.
2. There are 768 million people who do not 
have access to clean water. 
3. People in Africa spend 40 billion hours 
walking to collect clean water each year.
4. For young girls in rural areas, carrying 
heavy water bottles long distances is the main cause of injury.AP Photo

tional Greek environment, particularly 
the strong culture of heteronormativity, which is the societal tendency toward 
traditional gender roles and heterosex-
ual relationships. 
“The way it is traditionally structured 
doesn’t necessarily allow for same-sex relationships within the social settings with other chapters,” Hannahs said.
Students like May Niu, a UF 20-year-
old industrial and systems engineering sophomore, said she would be in sup-
port of an LGBT chapter coming to UF.
“I think it would be a good change,” Niu said. “There needs to be more rep-
resentation of the LGBT community around UF.”
But other students see it different-
ly, including Chandler Collins, a UF 19-year-old marketing freshman and a brother at UF’s Theta Chi.  
“I don’t think sexual orientation 
should play a factor in the clubs you can join,” he said.
He said the organization could face 
problems with the current social climate at UF.
“It would probably be difficult to 
start because of the tradition in the Greek system,” Collins said. “...it would probably be a rocky start.”4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 2014

Recent outbreaks of bacterial 
meningitis on the campuses of 
Princeton University and the Uni-versity of California, Santa Bar-bara, have raised concerns about possible future occurrences of the disease at UF. 
Diane Webb, the senior reg-
istered nurse at the UF Student Health Care Center, said since 1999, UF has strongly encouraged students to get the vaccination for bacterial meningitis.
“More than 80 percent of UF 
students have received the bacteri-al meningitis vaccine,” Webb said. “Since February 2003, all UF stu-dents are required to either receive the meningitis vaccine or sign a waiver to decline.”Nicole Iovine, the associate epi-
demiologist for UF Health Shands Hospital, said the B strain of bacte-rial meningitis caused the cases at Princeton and UC at Santa Barbara, but the vaccine offered by UF does not cover this specific strain. 
The current vaccine introduces 
specific sugars to the body that are present in meningitis bacteria but are foreign to the immune system, 
which sparks a response to fight 
the bacteria.
The B strain differs in that it 
contains a sugar naturally found on many human cells. The body 
does not see this sugar as foreign, 
Iovine said, so it does not respond 
to fight the bacteria.
“There is a vaccine for the B 
(strain) that is already out in places like Europe and Australia, but it’s 
not licensed yet in the U.S.,” Io-
vine said. “When the Princeton 
epidemic occurred, they allowed students to use it because it was an 
emergency.”
She said her close relationship 
with the Alachua County Health 
Department would enable her to access the B vaccine if needed.
“Heaven forbid there was some-
thing to happen like this at UF, it 
would be part of my job to get it,” 
she said. “I’m confident we would be able to get it.”

A group of UF students narrowly 
broke the Guinness World Record 
for the most people popping bubble wrap at the same time in a two-min-ute period. 
A UF Bateman campaign called 
“What’s Your Popping Point?” hosted the event Tuesday night in the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom. 
The previous record for people 
popping bubble wrap simultane-
ously was 366, set by a group of 
high schoolers in New Jersey. 
Tuesday night’s event burst that 
record with 367 students, said Ni-cole Vassallo, a 23-year-old UF pub-lic relations senior working on the 
campaign.
The team collected more than 
8,000 square feet of bubble wrap 
from student donations and UF Health Shands Hospital.
The Bateman campaign seeks to 
increase the popularity of a new 
person-to-person payment service, Popmoney.
Justine Gordon, a 19-year-old UF 
telecommunication sophomore, said 
she was impressed by the event. 
“It’s one of the most creative 
ideas to advertise a product,” she said. “It’s really innovative.”
The nearly 400 students stomped 
and popped bubble wrap while jam-ming out to ‘N Sync for two min-utes.  The timer went off and cheers and screams exploded.   
“UF is officially in the Guinness 
World Records,” said Vassallo.Students pop world record
About 20 to 30 drunken driving cases occur on campus yearly
related crashes were reported among people ages 15 to 19, and 133  fatal crashes were reported among people ages 20 to 24.
Chris Loschiavo, associate dean 
of students and director of student conflict and resolution at UF, said he was not surprised by the results of the study.Based on his 15 years of experi-
ence dealing with student-conduct issues, he said alcohol is probably the biggest challenge his office faces.
There are about one to two al-
cohol-poisoning transports report-ed on UF’s campus each weekend and about 20 to 30 drunken driv-ing cases on campus each year, Loschiavo said. The majority of these people charged with driving under the influence are below the age of 21. 
“Often times, one of the things that get into the way is when stu-
dents get into this drinking cul-
ture,” he said. ”It’s hard to get out of it once you start.”
Kristi Maconi, a 20-year-old 
UF finance junior, said lowering the drinking age would not have a drastic effect on the number of drunken driving cases.
“As a college student, if you 
have access to alcohol, you’re go-ing to drink anyways,” she said. 
“So lowering the drinking age 
wouldn’t really affect the number of people drinking and driving.”
Briana Felitti, a 20-year-old UF 
accounting junior, said she agreed.  
“Whether you’re 18 or 22 and 
you’re thinking about drinking and driving, if you’re going to get into a car, you’re going to get into 
a car,” she said.

Students will have to complete a full-time,

“A lot of them are going to be those same

The new program will also include cross-
disciplinary laboratory courses, pre-health seminars to help with nonacademic prepa-

Medical College Admission Test or Dental Admission Test.
The priority application deadline is April 1, but students have until July 15 to apply for the program, which starts this Fall.

A possible new location for the Alachua 
County Supervisor of Elections ofﬁ  ce was 
one of the topics deliberated at the County Commission meeting Tuesday.
Commissioners unanimously agreed to 
begin negotiations with Nalbandian Prop-erties for the property located on 515 N. Main St. 
Commissioner Robert Hutchinson said 
he believes it’s the right time to tie up plans for the building.
“It would be stupid to have a long con-
versation about who gets what and ﬁ  nd out that someone has already purchased 
the building,” he said at the meeting. 
County staff will be negotiating a lease-
purchase agreement, which would allow 
the county to buy the property outright or to buy it after leasing.
Michael Fay, county development pro-
gram manager, said the county is trying to eliminate the lease space it currently occu-
pies, which costs about $500,000 a year.
“We will take a strong, hard look at 
what the space needs to be — at what of-
ﬁ  ces we would put in this particular struc-ture,” he said.
The building is estimated to cost about 
$5.65 million.
Also at the meeting, Strike Out Hunger 
Food Drive held a presentation. Rodney 
Long, president and CEO of The Long 
Foundation Inc., highlighted a decrease in donations for the Thanksgiving food drive.
He said the drive collected $60,000 
pounds of food in 2013. In 2012, the food drive collected about $78,000 pounds of food. 
He attributed the decrease to a lack of 
major contributors and said he will start planning for the drive earlier.Commission discusses new

News-minded baby Gators arriving at UF 
this Summer are in for a change. 
Incoming Summer B students on the tele-
communication news track will be the ﬁ  rst 
class required to take Reporting, a notorious-
ly difﬁ  cult journalism course rumored to be 
one of the most failed and dropped classes at the university. They will also have to take its prerequisite class, Multimedia Writing. 
After a motion to approve the changes 
followed by the unanimous approval by the University Curriculum Committee on Feb. 18, both classes are now mandatory.
David Ostroff, the chair of the Depart-
ment of Telecommunication, said current students are still under the old catalog re-
quirements.
“No one who is already in college right now will be affected by these changes, even 
if they were to transfer into UF from a dif-ferent community college or university,” Os-troff said.
However, Ostroff said the class will be 
mandatory only for students who have passed the News Placement Test and been accepted into the telecommunication track.
Journalism master lecturer Mike Foley 
said he believes this is a “step in the right di-rection” for the college. 
He said Reporting teaches more than just 
newswriting and newsgathering; it instills 
critical thinking skills by forcing students to

proves companies 
act in self-interest
Yesterday, Apple released OS X 10.9.2, and if you haven’t 
already — download it ASAP. 
We know, we know: the endless stream of updates 
on your Macbooks, iPhones and iPads is tedious. However, the patches that Apple released for iPhones and iPads on Friday and 
the patch released for Macbooks and iMacs Tuesday don’t just 
ﬁ  x normal glitches and bugs. The updates ﬁ  x a serious security ﬂ  aw that could allow hackers with malicious intent to intercept your emails, banking information, passwords and other sensi-tive data. 
The security problem is pretty complicated and has to do 
with SSL-encrypted communications, but basically, according to Apple’s support page, current software “failed to validate the authenticity of the connection.”
“Without the ﬁ  x,” Reuters reported, “a hacker could imper-
sonate a protected site and sit in the middle as email or ﬁ  nancial data goes between the user and the real site.”
This ﬂ  aw is a huge, huge deal. Given Apple’s reputation as 
a purveyor of technology products that are immune to attacks from cybercriminals, the security loophole is a huge embarrass-ment for the company.  
According to Chris Williams of The Register, a U.K. publica-
tion specializing in information technology news, Apple’s failure 
to alert its customers of the security ﬂ  aw for days after detecting 
the bug was unprofessional. Furthermore, Williams argued that Apple waited to release the patch in order to bundle it with an upgrade for making voice calls with FaceTime. 
“On Monday, amid the fallout of the SSL bug, Apple CEO 
Tim Cook reﬂ  ected on the anniversary of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs’ birth, tweeting: ‘Remembering Steve on his birth-day: ‘Details matter, it’s worth waiting to get it right,’’” Williams wrote. “For users fearing their passwords and bank account de-
tails were about to be put in the hands of crooks, that wait felt 
like an eternity.”
Apple has remained tight-lipped about the ﬂ  aw, naturally. According to Reuters, “Apple did not reply to requests for 
comment. The ﬂ  aw appears to be in the way that well-under-stood protocols were implemented, an embarrassing lapse for a company of Apple’s stature and technical prowess.”
The security issue and Apple’s decision not to notify users 
immediately after the issue was detected reminds us that even 
seemingly reliable brands act in self-interest. Of course Apple 
didn’t want users to realize that it made a stupid mistake. This proves that it’s up to iPhone, iPad and Macbook owners — or any technology owner, for that matter — to be savvy when it comes to the security of his or her data. The prevailing attitude toward issues such as identity theft and email interception seems to be one of “That could never happen to me.”
However, just as our phones and computers become smarter 
and more intuitive, so do cyber criminals. It’s more important 
than ever to make sure you pay close attention to updates. 
Viva la iOS 7.0.6!Republicans to blame for ‘grim’ outlook
A new study released by the Leroy Collins Institute on 
Florida’s economic and ﬁ  scal health paints a bleak picture of the state’s present and future.
“Tougher Choices: Shaping Florida’s Future,” by UF 
researchers David Denslow and James Dewey, found that 
Florida lags behind other states in a wide array of economic 
and social indicators.
“In a lot of ways,” Dewey said, “Florida is really near the 
bottom of the barrel.”
As an example of Florida’s economic failures, teacher 
salaries in the Sunshine State declined at the fourth-fastest rate in the country between 2000 and 2012. Although the un-employment rate in Florida has dropped to 6 percent, down from its recent high of 11.4 percent in 2010, most of the em-
ployment gains in the past four years have come from an in-
crease in unskilled, low-wage jobs. 
Dewey describes this increase in low-wage jobs as a “po-
larization.” While other states reap the beneﬁ  ts of new jobs in high-tech industries, Florida has become a haven for low-paying jobs in food service and other unskilled sectors.
As the Florida economy has grown more dependent 
on these low-paying jobs, economic inequality has also in-creased. A recent study from the Brookings Institution, a 
Washington think tank, found that Miami ranked third 
among all American cities in the greatest disparity between its rich and its poor. 
The study also found that Florida’s lack of state income 
tax and reliance on sales and property taxes puts a dispro-portionate ﬁ  nancial strain on Florida families and small busi-nesses.
Sales taxes are inherently regressive, meaning that those 
earning less tend to pay a greater proportion of their income. 
The combination of higher taxes and lower-paying jobs for 
Florida’s workers spells serious trouble for the state’s eco-nomic future. 
Regrettably, Gov. Rick Scott and the Republican leader-
ship in the Florida Legislature seem determined to institute policies that would exacerbate the many problems outlined in the report. 
Instead of strengthening Florida’s tax base by increasing taxes on large corporations, which would also reduce the ﬁ  nancial burden on families and small busi-nesses, Scott has supported com-pletely eliminating the state’s cor-
porate income tax.
One of the few bright spots dis-
cussed in the report is the Florida 
Retirement System, the pension fund for the state’s public employ-
ees. Denslow and Dewey argue that the FRS provides a se-cure source of post-retirement income for Florida workers and should be a “model” for other states.
Republicans in the Florida Legislature have put forth pro-
posals to eviscerate the retirement system.
Legislation supported by Republicans in the Florida Leg-
islature would require new retired public employees to en-roll in deﬁ  ned contribution plans. The deﬁ  ned beneﬁ  t plans currently provided by the FRS guarantee public employees a ﬁ  xed level of post-retirement income.
The new plans would allow the FRS to sharply cut back 
on pension beneﬁ  ts, even on employees who have already paid into the system. If enacted, such a proposal could great-
ly harm the ﬁ  nancial stability of thousands of Florida retir-
ees, reducing their disposable income and thus negatively impacting economic growth. 
There are many possible solutions. Increasing the mini-
mum wage would provide greater ﬁ  nancial security to Flor-ida’s many new low-income workers. Instituting a progres-sive income tax and increasing corporate taxes would reduce the burden on middle-class families and small businesses.
Unfortunately, the Scott administration and the Republi-
cans who control the Florida Legislature are determined to institute policies that beneﬁ  t Big Business and the wealthi-est Floridians while leaving the middle class and the poor behind. Florida needs a change in leadership to get back on the path toward economic security and prosperity for all its citizens.

Beato’s minimum-wage column
On Feb. 18,  Michael Beato wrote a highly 
erroneous piece about increasing the mini-
mum wage. Today’s minimum wage is far below what it should be historically and con-tinues to lose value every year. If the federal 
minimum wage had kept up with inﬂ  ation, 
it would be about $10.75 an hour instead of $7.25. If the minimum wage had kept up with productivity, it would be $18.75. If it had grown at the same rate as wages for the top 1 percent, it would be more than $28.
In 2004, voters passed a constitutional 
amendment that tied the Florida minimum wage to inﬂ  ation. This year the rise was $0.14 from $7.79 to $7.93, which comes to about $5.60 more for 40 hours of work, or about $290 more 
per year. This increased the wages of 416,000 
low-wage earners and increased consumer spending by almost $63 million, according to the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute.
What Beato was talking about but didn’t 
mention is the Harkin-Miller bill. This bill would increase the minimum wage to $10.10 by 2015 over three years, index it to inﬂ  ation and increase the tipped-worker minimum to 
70 percent the federal minimum wage. For 
Florida, that means $2.17 more — $60 more a week for a 40-hour work week and about $3,000 more per year.
This would affect more than 30 million 
workers in America and generate $32 billion in new economic activity! Of those workers who would be affected, 88 percent are over the age of 20, 56 percent are women, nearly half are workers of color, and more than 43 percent have a college education.
Beato said, “Consider all of the mom-and-
pop stores struggling to make ends meet.” 
But he forgets that this is an ever-shrinking 
minority. The lions’ share of minimum-wage earners are at companies employing more than 100 workers. One of the largest, McDon-alds, raked in close to $5.5 billion in proﬁ  ts in 2012, which is up 27 percent over the past ﬁ  ve 
years. Meanwhile, taxpayers shell out $1.2 bil-
lion each year in public assistance to McDon-alds’ workforce.
The majority of all public assistance recipi-
ents are people with jobs who simply do not make enough to live. The public subsidizes the high proﬁ  ts of these private companies because the minimum wage is not a living wage.

Letters to the Editor
Education has al-
ways been a hot-button issue in 
this country. One side of this polarizing issue de-
mands respect for teach-
ers unions; the other says standardized testing is paramount. 
Despite the fact that 
there will never be a common ground, these two sides don’t even realize America is currently in an education paradox. Here are a few instances: 
Student loans have become increas-
ingly easy to get and almost impossi-ble to pay off. Young people struggle to ﬁ  nd jobs after college while college dropouts — such as Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey — are worth billions. Diane Ravitch, a research professor at New York Uni-versity, claims that the “kids today 
are, in fact, the smartest generation 
yet.” 
But the reality is our students con-
sistently fall behind other nations in math and science.  
Though many pundits, politicians 
and parents say the American educa-tion system is broken beyond repair, that’s not entirely true. Even with 
our falling math and science scores, 
young people of other nations ﬂ  ock to the U.S. for an education. Why is this the case? Can they not see the glaring education paradox in front of them?
The strength of the American edu-
cation system — a strength that makes up for the system’s many shortcom-ings — is that it promotes ingenuity. 
America has always been the innova-
tor of the world. Bill Gates, the Wright brothers and Thomas Edison were all American citizens — that is no ﬂ  uke. Ingenuity is truly an American qual-ity. Ingenuity breeds creativity, which equals success. 
But when you go back to the two 
hopelessly entrenched sides of the 
education debate, they promote poli-
cies that hinder the development of ingenuity. 
The pro-standardized testing 
crowd touts that the only way to gauge student success is to conduct broad examinations and have a cur-riculum based solely on that subject matter. 
These tests are good determinants 
of how well a student grasps universal concepts: calculus, reading and gram-mar skills. What is tested on these ex-ams are black-and-white concepts. If you do X, what is Y? What grammar rule is being violated in this sentence? 
But real life is not so 
clear-cut. 
Creativity can neither 
be tested on paper nor proctored. A good edu-cation relies both on the strong concepts featured on standardized tests 
and creative reasoning, thinking and learning. Simply believing that exams are a complete solution to our national woes is unrealistic.       
Those touting teachers unions 
would like to believe that every teach-er is great, but reality suggests other-wise. For every great teacher, there is a handful of those not up to snuff. 
And in America, the place  you are 
educated determines the quality of your education. An inner-city school in Los Angeles, for example, is of a dif-
ferent caliber than that of a suburban 
school in Connecticut. I think it’s fair to say most good teachers would ﬂ  ock to the school in Connecticut, and as a result, schools in good locations have a monopoly on superior teachers. 
Though standardized tests and 
teachers union issues generally gravi-tate toward high school and middle 
school, the college education system 
does its part to quell ingenuity. As a college student, I take a lot of lecture-based classes. Although these classes are a great time to catch up on sleep or update your Facebook status, they completely stiﬂ  e creativity. 
The tyranny of thought on the side 
of the professor is the main cause. 
A teaching assistant told me that I 
should not select the right answer on an exam, but the answer that my professor thought was correct. Those unable to think for themselves or afraid of confrontation acquiesce to the prescribed thoughts of the profes-sor. Thinking for oneself is hopelessly squashed in lecture halls.
This country needs to embrace the 
virtues that made it a global super-power. Instead of ascribing whole-heartedly to the beliefs of older na-tions, we created a few belief systems of our own. Ingenuity by virtue of individuality made us great. Until we realize the true power our students possess, we will continue to under-
perform nationwide. But until then, at 
least the kids are out of the house.

system paradox in the USColumn
The words in this column 
come difﬁ  cult for me, as I have many friends and col-
leagues who are currently enjoying a momentous win with the Swamp Party. 
 And yet, the circumstances in which such a 
victory have been obtained compel me to speak 
out.
This year’s election was extraordinary, not 
only for the one-sided victory of one party 
over all other challengers. 
For the ﬁ  rst time in my experience at UF, 
the opposition was banned from contesting the presidency by none other than Swamp Party’s appointed supervisor of elections. To claim that the supervisor’s hands were tied 
by the rules of the system with no leeway in 
respect to the gravity of holding a contest for the most important positions within Student Government is false.
In addition to the contributions from 
Swamp’s supervisor of elections, further ef-fort was required from all Swamp senators this past year in maintaining a system of rules that produces an inordinate burden on 
the average student from participating and 
contesting within SG. 
Simple measures such as expanding on-
line voting for students living off campus or 
even improving the efﬁ  ciency of the absentee 
ballot process were blocked and denied by Swamp Party. 
For some within Swamp, this was a dif-
ﬁ  cult task as many measures surely felt right 
in their hearts but nevertheless felt wrong with the party.
As a result of Swamp Par-
ty’s actions — and inactions — Swamp succeeded in dropping 
student turnout by more than 2,000 from last year’s general 
election. 
Faced with the lack of a meaningful choice 
for the most powerful positions in SG, it is easy to understand why many students 
stayed home.
In spite of all these developments, howev-
er, the worst part about all of this is that that 
some within Swamp will likely believe they have accomplished something praiseworthy 
— something they would tell their grandpar-
ents or put on a resume or job application.
Fortunately, there are a couple of positive 
things we can attribute to this election. 
First, now that Swamp has effectively 
used the rules to implement a de facto one-party system on campus, we can ﬁ  nally dis-
pense with the democratic pleasantries and 
talk about SG as it really is and not how it pretends to be.
Second, SG’s reputation was damaged in 
such a manner that elections have now be-
come predetermined and meaningless.
 Its status now contains more parallels 
with modern competitive authoritarian re-
gimes than the U.S. 
The mission of SG should now be clear: 
Reform before it is too late.

Mayor Ed Braddy wants to get 
students more involved in the City 
of Gainesville with a revamped in-ternship program. 
Interns used to do little more 
than shadow the City Commission, but Braddy said this semester, he’s hoping to create a more hands-on experience by having interns man-age projects and work on policy. 
“When I campaigned, I told the 
Student Body I would be willing to work with them,” Braddy said. “I want to make them know they are a part of our community … to give students an idea of how their local 
government works and give them 
an opportunity to participate in a more hands-on manner.”Often, the 
only times Brad-dy hears from students are when they show up to meetings expecting over-night change, he 
said. By getting 
interns more 
involved in City Hall, he said he hopes students will get a better idea of how the local government works. 
Meredith Ryan, a 19-year-old UF political science junior, applied for one of the positions and said she is excited about the changes.
“This shows me that accom-
plished leaders in the commu-nity care about young people and their ideas,” she said. She said the internship gets students person-
ally involved in local government, 
which is vastly different from state and national government.
Braddy said the program is still 
in its early stages, but he wants it to become a part of the bigger picture of student engagement in the city.“Maybe we’ll submit student 
bids as well as professional bids,” he said, suggesting a possible mar-keting program for RTS. “But that’s on the drawing board.”
What’s most important is stu-
dent inclusion in Gainesville city life and government, Braddy said.
“My ultimate vision after my 
three years in office is that the Stu-dent Body feels appreciated and ... that they’ve had a good opportuni-ty to participate and engage in city life,” he said. “If they didn’t, it’s not because the city didn’t listen.”

On a stage at the Curtis M. Phillips Center 
for the Performing Arts, Jim grappled with an 
issue many young adults face:  cyberbullying. 
About 260 people showed up Friday 
through Sunday for the Florida Players’ ren-
dition of “Chatroom” to watch Jim’s character 
struggle with the issue, which has become more prevalent with the rise of technology 
use.
Although Jim exists only in the play, his 
story is real to young people dealing with cy-
berbullying in their everyday lives.
UF psychologist Roberta Seldman said cy-
berbullying can be even more dangerous than face-to-face criticisms and judgments.
“We’re all herd animals,” she said. “We 
don’t want to be outside of the group, and 
anything that puts us out there causes a very 
primal terror in us.”
She said fear, paranoia, sadness and suicid-al thoughts are not unusual responses.
“It can make someone who doesn’t feel 
connected anyway feel like there’s no reason to live,” she said.
Jeremy Martinez, the 19-year-old UF the-
atre performance sophomore who played Jim in the show, said he knows what it’s like to play the part both on and off the stage.
He attended a competitive all-boys high 
school where he said he didn’t quite fit in.
“I’m just not that kind of person, so I was 
hit with a lot of... derogatory terms and a lot of bullying,” he said.UF theatre performance senior Amanda 
Young, who directed “Chatroom,” said cy-berbullying and teen suicide have been swept under the rug.
“Sometimes people don’t even realize that 
the things they say have a lasting impact,” Young, 21, said.
Young said she hopes the viewers will re-
evaluate their online communication and un-derstand what it’s like to fall victim.
Martinez agreed.   “The way I see it,” he said, “Jim is a part of 
everyone.”   Florida Players puts on cyberbullying play at Phillips CenterTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MIAMI — The U.S. govern-
ment asked a judge to dismiss 
a lawsuit that seeks to over-
turn a nationwide ban on four 
giant snake species.
Attorneys for Interior Sec-
retary Sally Jewell and the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
said the United States Asso-
ciation of Reptile Keepers has not sufficiently explained why importing the snakes into the 
U.S. or transporting them 
across state lines was vital to 
research and conservation ac-tivities among its members.
In a motion in federal 
court in Washington, D.C., on Friday, the government dismissed the association’s claims that snake sales funded those activities.“Not only are these inter-
ests entirely economic, they are also totally unrelated to the environment: they involve the breeding and selling of captive snakes as part of the pet industry,” the motion stated.
The North Carolina-based 
association said the ban has cost tens of millions of dollars. In December, the group chal-lenged the science behind the ban in a lawsuit.
“We still feel very confi-
dent about our position,” Joan Galvin, an attorney represent-ing the reptile keepers asso-ciation, said Tuesday.
The ban on Burmese py-
thons, yellow anacondas and northern and southern African rock pythons was announced in 2012. Nationwide giant

In the first Student Senate meet-
ing following Student Government 
elections, the election results were validated and a new Senate presi-dent, Senate president pro tempore 
and members at large were elected 
and sworn into office.
The Elections Commission voted 
unanimously to validate the SG elections, said Elections Commis-sion Chairwoman Celeste Thacker, and Senate unanimously validated the results as well.
Tuesday night’s Senate session 
was divided into two. The first meet-ing provided a forum for old sena-tors to say goodbye and wish the newly elected senators good luck.
In his last Senate President’s Re-
port, Student Body President Cory Yeffet advised senators to take full advantage of what Senate has to of-fer.
“Understand the climate that you’ve been lucky enough to get elected into,” he said. “Take hold and make the most out of it.”
The second meeting was to swear in the senators for the new term and elect a new Senate president, Senate president pro tempore and mem-
bers at large.
Sen. Dylan Fisher and Sen. Jo-
seph Michaels were unanimously 
elected as the new Senate president and the new Senate president pro tempore, respectively.
Sen. Bronco Vuskovich and Sen. 
Spencer Correnti were unanimous-ly elected as the two members at 
large.Chief Justice of the Student Body 
Marcus Powers swore in the new 
senators, president, president pro-
tempore and members at large.
The Senate unanimously passed 
two resolutions in its first meeting: 
the Resolution Supporting the Uni-versity of Florida’s Academic Ties with the State of Israel, which states that UF does not support a boycott of Israel’s academic institutions, and the Resolution Proposing Revisions 
to the Rules and Procedures.

Transfer students have a new option to 
guide them through life in the Swamp.
Adopted Gators was founded this se-
mester to ensure transfer students the op-
portunity to excel on campus, said presi-
dent and founder of the program, Diesha 
Cole, a 20-year-old UF linguistics junior.
Applications for members are now 
available on the Student Activities and Involvement section of UF’s website and close March 13.  
Program organizers hope to accept 
about 50 peer mentors this semester. Transfer students with Associate of Arts 
degrees will be able to join the group at 
Preview in the upcoming semesters, she said.
“We will give them an inside look at 
UF,” Cole said.
The program’s goal is to inform transfer 
students about campus events and point them in the direction of involvement.
“You could miss out on everything 
available to you if you don’t have some-one else to tell you,” she said.
Cole came up with the idea for Adopt-
ed Gators because she is a transfer student herself. Her best friend and co-founder, Gianna McNealy, helped her a lot when she ﬁ  rst transferred to campus.
“I’m at a better place than I would’ve 
been if I hadn’t had her giving me that in-
side look,” she said.
Michelle Albert, a 21-year-old UF pub-lic relations junior and Campus Diplomat, 
said she thinks the new program is a great addition to transfer student services al-ready offered. Although Campus Diplo-mats hosts one event for transfer students, it does not provide an ongoing program for them.
Morgan Crummett, a 19-year-old po-
litical science sophomore at Florida Gulf Coast University who plans to transfer to UF, said she wants to get involved on UF’s campus, despite how much bigger it is than her  current school.
“I think it would be helpful to go some-
where where there are other transfers,” she said. “I think it’s helpful for students 
who want to get involved.”Program created to help

Scottie Wilbekin couldn’t 
ice the game, Michael Frazier 
II couldn’t break out from be-
hind the arc and Casey Prath-
er couldn’t score during the game’s last 32 minutes.
But when all else failed 
against Vanderbilt on Tues-day night, Dorian Finney-Smith didn’t.
No. 1 Florida (26-2, 15-0 
Southeastern Conference) es-
caped from Nashville, Tenn., 
with a 57-54 victory thanks to Finney-Smith, who finished the night 6 of 11 for a game-
high 19 points.
The redshirt sophomore 
broke out of his 1-of-25 slump 
from three-point range to hit 3 of 6 threes against the Com-
modores (15-12, 7-8 SEC), 
including his biggest shot of the night with 33 seconds left in a two-point contest.
After letting a 12-point 
lead with just more than 13 minutes left in the second half crumble to a 54-52 battle within the final minute, the 
Gators created some breath-ing room once Wilbekin 
found a wide-open Finney-Smith at the top of the arc.
“We really needed it,” 
coach Billy Donovan said of Finney-Smith’s clutch perfor-mance. “It was good to see him kind of break out.”
The last time Finney-
Smith had a double-digit scoring performance was Feb. 1 against Texas A&M. In the six games leading up 
to Tuesday night’s matchup 
with Vanderbilt, the 6-foot-8 forward averaged just 4.5 points per game on 22 per-
cent shooting.
Despite the unlikely turn-
around by Finney-Smith, the 
Gators still struggled to cre-ate separation from the Com-
modores down the stretch. 
In the first half, Florida 
forced 11 turnovers includ-
ing five from the press, but 
Vanderbilt’s 10-of-20 shoot-
ing from the floor and 4 of 10 from three kept it down only 32-25 at the break. 
Even when the Gators ex-
tended their lead to a game-high 12 points about midway through the second half, the Commodores used three con-secutive three-pointers to thrust themselves back into the game.
Donovan said a big reason 
why Florida still clung to a lead despite allowing eight threes from Vanderbilt was 
the Gators’ hustle for second-
chance opportunities led by Finney-Smith and Patric Young.
Finney-Smith led all play-
ers with nine rebounds in the game, but six of Young’s seven total rebounds were on the offensive side of the 
ball. Florida outrebounded 
Vanderbilt 31-25, including a 13-3 advantage on offensive rebounds.
“That was a huge key,” 
Donovan said. “Patric chased basketballs on the backboard ... Dorian Finney-Smith got to the glass. We did a really, 
really good job on the back-
board keeping possessions alive.”
But a subpar performance 
at the free-throw line almost 
negated the Gators’ effort on 
the glass. Finney-Smith helps Gators

The Gators dubbed their first loss of the sea-
son — a 4-2 upset at the hands of Northwestern, 
— a valuable learning experience.
What about the team’s second loss, a 7-0 
drubbing they received at the hands of No. 4 Stanford on Sunday?
“Just ouch,” coach Roland Thornqvist said.
Really?
“Really. That’s what it was,” he said. “I’ve 
been here 13 years and we haven’t had a lot of those.”
The Gators have lost seven times since the 
start of the 2010 season. Four of those losses have come against Stanford. 
The difference between the Northwestern 
loss and the Stanford loss is plain. 
The first defeat made the freshmen-loaded 
Florida aware of the target on its back — one that can only be acquired from winning two straight national championships and conquering the 
Southeastern Conference three years in a row. 
Every opponent the Gators 
face wants to beat them — 
badly.
The seniors, and now the 
freshmen, understand that.
“Sometimes the underdog 
will come in and play very 
free because they have no 
pressure on them,” senior Al-
exandra Cercone said earlier in the season. “So 
you know, they could come out and have the match of their life.”
Lesson learned. 
That makes the second match against Stan-
ford the exam, one Thornqvist thinks the team 
failed. Florida hopes to regain footing 
after blowout Stanford loss� GATORS HAVE TWO GAMES

With two games remaining in the 
season, the Gators hope to round back 
into the form that’s given them a shot at making the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2012. 
But Florida has found itself in the 
midst of its second three-game los-ing streak in Southeastern Conference play thanks to inconsistencies on both sides of the ball. 
Against Georgia, Florida racked up 
19 personal fouls and turned the ball 
over 18 times in a 67-58 loss. Against 
Missouri, Florida surrendered 81 points and 12 threes to the hottest three-point shooting team in the SEC.
On Sunday against South Carolina, Florida mustered only 55 points after an 8-for-32 shooting performance in 
the first half. 
“The one thing that hurt us down 
the stretch and in parts of the game 
were critical plays and not being very smart in making the right decisions and trying to overdo things at times,” assistant coach David Lowery said.
Redshirt senior Lily Svete may be 
one of those individuals “overdoing” 
things. 
Since posting a career-high 17 
points in a home win against then-No. 
15 Kentucky, she has failed to score a point in the three games since. 
“Teams are paying attention to her 
a little bit more,” Lowery said. “We 
haven’t really tried to change what 
she’s doing. This is crunch time. Our kids have got a lot of pressure on them. I’m not saying that’s part of it, UF aims for NCAA tourney

� GATORS GAVE UP ONLY 14 
POINTS IN PAST TWO GAMES.
EDEN OTERO
Alligator Writer @edenotero_l
After graduating 13 seniors in 
2013, the No. 5 Gators (4-1)  are 
quickly working to strengthen their depleted defense.
In the first five games of the 
season, Florida has yet to show a spectacular defensive effort. How-ever, after being blown out by No. 1 North Carolina (4-0) in their sea-son-opener on Feb. 8, the Gators have worked to establish a more stable defense.
Coach Amanda O’Leary said 
Monday that the Gators are work-ing to strengthen the defense, and they have made strides toward be-coming tougher in defending the cage.
It’s always said that the best of-
fense is a good defense. However, Florida has won its last four games by keeping the offense in control of the ball, letting the defense and midfielders work on causing turn-overs and helping goalkeepers senior Cara Canington and sopho-more Mary-Sean Wilcox make big saves.
In Florida’s most recent win, a 
19-6 blowout against Cincinnati (0-
2) on Saturday, the Gators proved 
that their offense was best at break-
ing down man-to-man coverage and staying quick on the draw. Though playing well on offense is good for UF now, it could be detri-mental when Florida starts to face 
ranked opponents — such as No. 7 
Loyola, which the Gators play next week — if its defense isn’t in line.
“Against James Madison and, 
actually, Cincinnati as well, our 
team played really well offensive-
ly,” O’Leary said. “Defensively, again, it’s a work in progress. We 
have a young squad on that defen-
sive end as well.” 
Senior Krista Grabher is the 
only remaining senior defender, with the exception of Canington.
Grabher was named American 
Lacrosse Conference Player of the 
Week on Tuesday after helping 
hold Cincinnati and James Madi-son to a combined 14 points. In 
addition, she recorded two ground 
balls and one draw control.
Grabher said Florida’s current 
defense and the previous year’s side are much different. 
“We have a completely differ-
ent mindset this year on defense,” 
Grabher said. “We used to play a 
very individualistic-type-style de-fense. Now, with a younger team, 
we’re able to make it more cohe-
sive, a more team defense.”
With four sophomores and 
three freshmen, Grabher diligently helped lead and reform the entire defensive end of the team.
However, O’Leary has worked 
hard in the last few weeks to strengthen the style that allows the Gators to work as a cohesive unit with Canington or Wilcox in the center, telling the defense exactly 
what to expect next.“[Goalkeepers] are a huge part 
of it because they are our eyes,” 
Grabher said. “They tell us every-thing that we can’t see.” 
Canington has 23 saves this sea-
son and posted a season high of 
13 against UNC. Wilcox has also been at the top of her game, mak-ing a total of 18 saves this season 
and posting a season high of five against James Madison. 
O’Leary has been happy with 
the efforts by Wilcox and Caning-
ton, saying multiple times that both goalkeepers have shown that the Gators can depend upon them.
“We’re solid in the goal cage 
with Cara and Mary-Sean,” 
O’Leary said. 
“But our defense is showing 
some real signs of progress.”

The Southeastern Conference Champion-
ships are over for Florida’s swimming and 
diving teams. Now, the focus shifts solely to the national championship meet set to begin on March 27 in Austin, Texas.
Although the No. 8 women’s team came 
up short of their goals — placing third at SECs — it did qualify three more swimmers for the NCAA meet, bringing their total number to 15 NCAA “A” cut qualifications. Sophomore Sinead Russell leads the bunch with seven “A” cuts and competes in all five relays. Fel-low sophomore Natalie Hinds and senior Eliz-abeth Beisel have six each.“We qualified three more 
women for the NCAA meet and feel like we’re in a good 
position to move on,” coach 
Gregg Troy said. 
“I was proud of the way 
they raced and their intensi-ty in the meet, so I think it’s a good building point for them for what we’re look-
ing at next month.”
Beisel managed to get one of her four indi-
vidual “A” cuts by breaking the school record in the 200-yard individual medley with a time of 1:54.26. 
The men went ballistic at SECs, coming in 
first for the second consecutive year. They set seven school records and qualified for three more events — including the lone relay that hadn’t made the cut.
But the competition took a lot out of both 
teams.
“They’re tired. Five days of racing is worse 
than two weeks of training,” Troy said. “Our preparation for the meet certainly wasn’t like the end of the year, so there’s a whole lot left in the tank. It’s a good dynamic from that point.”
NCAA Championships have been Troy’s 
focus since the season began in late Septem-ber, and the Bulldog Last Chance Meet on Friday will be the Gators’ final opportunity to qualify swimmers for nationals.
Troy expects everyone who competes to make a run at qualifying, specifically redshirt sophomore Austin Manganiello, junior Billy Silva and sophomore Luke Torres, but said 
it would depend on how they respond to the 
dynamic.
The women’s team is more built for 
NCAAs compared to the conference meet, but Troy said they need to make roster revisions before he’s satisfied.
Both teams will need to improve on some 
technical issues over the next month, namely breakouts. 
Troy believes his men’s team can improve 
on its performance at SECs.
“I don’t think we have anyone that can’t 
go faster than what we did this weekend,” he said.
Gators look to final meet before NCAA Championships
EMILY COCHRANE

The Gators left New Orleans 
with their best finish of the 2013-14 
season.
No. 16 Florida began Round 3 
of the Allstate Sugar Bowl Intercol-
legiate Championship in third place 
and finished the tournament in third with a score of 858 (-6), trailing tour-nament winner No. 2 UCLA and runner-up No. 1 USC.It was the fifth-lowest tourna-
ment score in the team’s history and its best score in four years in the 
English Turn Golf & Country Club.
“It was a great tournament for us. 
We put together three solid rounds 
and played smart golf all week,” coach Emily Glaser said in a release. “The girls worked hard after a dis-appointing finish in California, and we saw that pay off this week.”
Every player on the Florida team shot even or below par at least once during the three rounds of competi-tion, even though the first 36 holes were played in one day due to rain Sunday morning.
Maria Torres led 
the Gators during the final round, ty-ing for third with 
two other golfers with a score of 210 (-6). 
The freshman shot under par 
during each of the three rounds and left New Orleans with not only her lowest collegiate tournament score, but also a personal-best score of 69, which she shot in the final round.
“Maria had a great tournament 
and improved each day,” Glaser said. “Her wedge game was great this week.
Junior Sarah Schober also fin-
ished under par with a score of 214 (-2), tying for 14th place with two other golfers.
Senior Elcin Ulu and junior Ca-
milla Hedberg both shot their low-est tournament scores of the season. Ulu tied for 32nd with a score of 219 (+3), and Hedberg tied for 27th with a score of 218 (+2).
Redshirt sophomore Katie Mitch-
ell and freshman Karolina Vlckova, who competed as an individual, tied each other and six other players for 37th place with a score of 220 (+4).
Florida’s next tournament is the 
SunTrust Gator Invitational at Mark Bostick Golf Course at UF on March 14. The Gators placed third in 2013.
 “We will gain a lot of confidence 
from this finish in California and the opportunity to play with the No. 1 and No. 2 ranked teams,” Glaser said.
Florida finishes third at Sugar Bowl Intercollegiate Championship
UF GolfTroy
Result was UF’s best of ‘14“When you’re an athlete 
at Florida, every year, you go 
through a thorough examina-
tion, coaches and players, of 
what you’re made of,” Thorn-qvist said. 
“The Northwestern loss re-
ally taught us a valuable lesson, I thought, and we rebounded so nicely the match after [that] loss. What our players had out-lined, what they wanted, how 
they supported each other, 
so on and so forth. We really didn’t do a good job of that [against Stanford].”
After three years of defer-
ring to former All-Americans Lauren Embree and Allie Will, the blame is now natu-rally shifted to Florida’s oldest 
players: Olivia Janowicz, Sofie 
Oyen and Cercone. 
The four losses to Stanford 
compose over half the team’s defeats since the arrival of the 
Gators’ current seniors. For 
those three, the transition from 
students to leaders has had its 
challenges.
“It has to be our leaders 
who have been through the 
ring of fire already — our se-
niors,” Thornqvist said. “I think they were very hurt by the loss [Sunday]. For the first time, they’re responsible for 
the whole group.  And there’s 
a learning curve to that, just as 
there’s one to a freshmen com-
ing in and trying to figure ev-
erything out.”
However, if history is any 
indication, there is good news 
for Florida.
After falling to Stanford 
in the 11th game of the 2011 
season — almost the exact situation the Gators (8-2) find 
themselves in now — Florida 
rattled off 21 consecutive wins en route to an NCAA Champi-onship.After losing to Stanford the 
next year, the Gators finished the season with 22 consecu-
tive wins and a second national 
title. 
“It’s part of the romance of 
being here, I think,” Thornqvist 
said. “You just get put to the 
test every time.
“When we fly to Palo Alto 
to play the defending national champions, we expect to win. 
And when we don’t, it’s sup-
posed to hurt. That’s just the 
way it is.”
Florida is hoping history re-
peats itself as it prepares for its 
next match against No. 9 Texas A&M at the end of the week. 
“[This weekend] just isn’t 
the standard we’re accustomed to, and I think [the team] takes full responsibility and account-ability. I sure do,” Thornqvist 
said.
“They’re going to be better 
Friday, I can guarantee you 
that.”but I think it’s a lot that they’re think-
ing about. I think she’s just got to re-lax and let the game flow to her. When she gets opportunities, she’s got to take advantage of them.”
Redshirt sophomore Cassie Peo-
ples has been another player who has struggled with consistency.
Heading into South Carolina, Peo-
ples was 3 for 33 from beyond the arc. 
“Cassie just hasn’t shot the ball 
well,” Lowery said. “It’s not like she’s taking bad shots. You talk about a kid that gets in the gym all the time and is 
shooting the ball and really working 
on focusing on hitting the shots she needs.”
Against the Gamecocks, however, 
Peoples went 2 for 4 from three-point range, sinking both of her shots in the first half. 
“Hopefully, she’s finding some 
rhythm here,” Lowery said. “We know 
she can score, but she’s got to also 
keep shooting. It’s like every shooter or kid that can score; you’re going to go through times where you’re not going to hit shots. I think she’s gain-ing that confidence more now.
“She knows she has the ability 
to hit the shots. She’s just got to hit them.”However, Peoples was held score-
less in the second half. 
The loss to the Gamecocks exem-
plified Florida’s half-to-half inconsis-tencies it has been experiencing dur-ing its three-game skid. 
In the first half, the Gators shot 25 
percent from the field and were down 32-22 at halftime. 
In the second half, they shot 40.7 
percent and scored 33 points, but they 
surrendered 37 to the Gamecocks in 
the same half. 
“I thought, for the most part, we 
started the game the way we wanted to,” Lowery said. “We jumped out 7-0 on them. We got some big plays down the stretch defensively, but on the of-fensive end, we weren’t being very tough at trying to get to the rim or get-
ting in the paint and making the plays 
we needed to.”
Florida’s most consistent post play-
er, Kayla Lewis, had only three points and four rebounds in the first half. In the second half, she scored 12 points and grabbed five more boards. 
“Going down the second half, I 
thought Kayla Lewis, for one, really 
stepped up,” Lowery said. 
“In the first half, she was, I’m not 
going to say non-existent, but I didn’t 
think she was the player that she could be. I think our defense led to that offense.”WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

After Finney-Smith extended Florida’s 
lead to five following his three-point shot 
with 33 seconds on the clock, Vanderbilt’s 
Kyle Fuller answered with a layup to bring 
the game back to within one possession.
After Fuller fouled Wilbekin with 10 sec-
onds remaining, the senior point guard had 
a chance to seal the win by sinking at least 
the first of his one-and-one from the line. But Wilbekin’s shot rimmed out and the Commo-dores had one last shot to tie the game with a three.
Vanderbilt inbounded the 
ball out of a timeout with 6.6 seconds left and gave Fuller an open three from the left 
wing. The ball bounced off 
the glass, hit the front of 
the rim and by the time the Commodores retrieved the 
rebound, it was too late to try another three.
“I should have fouled him as soon as he 
started dribbling,” Young said. “We were very fortunate that he missed that shot.”

� MCLEAN HAS POSTED A 
.412 BATTING AVERAGE.
JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Writer @J_McPherson1126
Justine McLean has found her 
stride.
After a slow start to her fresh-
man campaign, the Rancho Cu-
camonga, Calif., native is now one of Florida’s most consistent players at the plate.
Through Florida’s ﬁ  rst six 
games of the season, in which McLean started ﬁ  ve in the out-ﬁ  eld, she garnered only one hit in 10 at-bats.
“She was still fast and she was 
still athletic through the ﬁ  rst six games, but she was really ner-vous,” coach Tim Walton said. 
“She was trying to meet some ex-
pectations that she built up, and her insides were turning really fast.”
But in her last nine games, the 
ﬁ  rst-year outﬁ  elder posted a .542 batting average and a .667 slug-ging percentage after logging 13 hits, including a double and a 
triple.
McLean said the upperclass-
men have helped her relax and 
have eased her transition into college softball.
“It’s so nerve-wracking be-
cause I’ve been dreaming of this moment since high school,” McLean said. 
“But we’re all really close, and they all know how to calm me down because they’ve all been in this position before.” 
McLean’s .412 average at the 
plate is 17th in the Southeast-ern Conference and sixth among freshmen in the SEC. 
Her six stolen bases are the 
second most among SEC fresh-men, trailing only Tennessee’s Megan Geer, who has seven.
“She’s really doing a good 
job,” Walton said. “I can see her smile a little bit more and breathe a little bit easier. “As fast as she is, as athletic as 
she is, it’s really hard to measure that when you’ve got your insides churning as fast as I think they were. I think the game’s slowing 
down for her now and she looks a 
lot more conﬁ  dent at the plate.”
Through Florida’s ﬁ  rst three 
tournaments of 2014, Walton 
has been experimenting with 
McLean’s position in the batting rotation. 
She started the season off as 
the last batter in the lineup, but 
Walton moved her to second in 
the order during Florida’s home opener against Jacksonville and kept her there through Day 2 of 
the Lipton Invitational on Satur-
day. 
He intends to keep McLean at 
the bottom of the order.
“It’s going to be better in 
the nine-one just because of the way Kelsey Stewart was pitched around late in the game to get to Justine,” Walton said. “Justine is 
probably going to beat you, and 
she can. … But the likelihood of that happening doesn’t seem to be as high in the opponent’s per-spective.”
Despite the improvement, 
McLean still feels she has room to grow.
“I have expectations for my-
self and I don’t think I’ve really met them yet,” she said. 
“But overall, I think that I can 
work towards it and it’ll just get better from here.”Freshman on hot streak after slow start to ﬁ  rst season
