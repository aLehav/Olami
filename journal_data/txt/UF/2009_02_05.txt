Gainesville Police officers and investigators cover with tarps a car containing the body of Timothy Ball of Inverness, Fla., who died from stab 
wounds in the parking lot of the Regal Gainesville Cinema 14 in Butler Plaza on Wednesday. Police do not suspect any foul play.

A man was found dead in 
his car in the parking lot of 
a Gainesville movie theater Wednesday evening.
The body of Inverness man 
Timothy Ball, 26, was found in-side a silver Kia in the parking lot of Regal Gainesville Cinema 14.
Ball had been stabbed in his 
upper torso, said Gainesville Police Department spokesman Keith Kameg.
Kameg said GPD will conduct 
a death investigation, but the de-
partment does not suspect any 
foul play.
Ball is not a UF student and has 
no apparent ties to Gainesville, Kameg said.
Kameg said police were dis-
patched to an injured person call at the theater, located at 3101 S.W. 35th Blvd., at 5:47 p.m. 
Ball’s body was sitting upright 
in the driver’s seat of his parked car in the lot. His head was slight-ly tilted to the right and his gray polo shirt was bloodstained.
The weapon was found in the 
car, Kameg said.
A Regal employee said they 
saw Ball alive in the car earlier in the day, apparently talking on his cell phone, Kameg said.
The cause of death will be 
determined after the autopsy re-sults come back.

After seven months of investigations, 
a Gainesville Police Officer was charged with three felonies, including grand theft valued at $5,000 or more, official miscon-duct and scheme to defraud and obtain 
property.
In a related investigation, Bill Billings, 
51, was charged Jan. 28 with having sex 
with prostitutes while on duty. 
At 4:30 a.m. Wednesday, Billings turned 
himself in and was released from jail un-der the condition that he would return for his court date, according to an Alachua County Jail employee.
In July, Billings was placed under secret 
surveillance after his fellow police officers were tipped off that he’d paid prostitutes 
to have sex with him in the back of his pa-
trol car. 
During the surveillance that lasted 
from July 7 to Aug. 25, a GPS placed on Billing’s car revealed that he was getting paid for overtime assignments that he was not working.
According to the GPD arrest report, 
Billings was assigned to be the Gainesville Police Department Recruiter as part of his overtime duties.
The GPD internal investigation revealed 
that Billings took care of personal business in other cities while he was supposed to be recruiting, the report stated.
Billings signed his time sheets every 
pay period knowing that the information on them was false, the report stated. 
According to the report, Billings re-
ceived $5,409.38 during the seven weeks he was under surveillance.
Billings was placed on administrative 
leave on Aug. 26. When confronted by 
officials about the surveillance, Billings 
apologized for his actions for dishonoring the department, the report stated.
Billings resigned on Aug. 29.“The Gainesville Police Department 
concluded the investigations into former employee Bill Billings,” said GPD Chief Norman Botsford. “His arrest today is the next step in the case.” GPD officer arrested, charged with three felonies

Crist backing new central Fla. commuter rail bill
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Gov. Charlie Crist is backing an ef-
fort to revive a proposed commuter rail line for central Florida.
Crist held a news conference Wednesday with Orlando Mayor 
Buddy Dyer and area lawmakers to tout the $1.1 billion SunRail proj-
ect. The price includes $491 million in state money to buy tracks from CSX, improve the rail company’s facilities and relocate a freight yard. The rest of the local, state and federal money would be spent building the system.
Crist and others said new legislation resolves liability issues that 
caused the Senate to reject a House-passed measure last year.
Critics, though, still stay it’ll be a costly handout to CSX.n A national 
group is 
organizing a 
Teach-In to 
raise global 
warming 
awareness.

Machen meets with FBI in D.C. to discuss Iran trip 
Study: Fla. students fall below national average HIS PRIMARY PURPOSE WAS TO 
SEEK FUNDING FOR UF PROJECTS.
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator.org
UF President Bernie Machen will be re-
turning to the office today after spending 
the last three days in Washington, D.C.Machen was in the capital lobbying for 
more federal funds, discussing the eco-nomic stimulus package with lawmakers and meeting with the FBI.
The primary purpose of the trip was to 
seek funding for UF projects that might not see state dollars because of the state’s budget crunch, said UF spokesman Steve Orlando.
“We’re looking at all other possibilities,” 
Orlando said.The projects include research on breast 
cancer, citrus diseases, aging, alternative fuels and rehabilitation tech-niques for soldiers com-
ing home from Iraq and 
Afghanistan.
Machen was also get-
ting a sense from law-makers on how much UF 
might receive from the $800 billion-plus economic stimulus package before the U.S. 
Senate.
On Wednesday, Machen met with 
the FBI during the quarterly meeting of 
the National Security Higher Education 
Advisory Board, appointed in 2005 to foster 
communication and cooperation between higher education and the bureau on issues like terrorism and counterintelligence. 
At the meeting, Machen discussed his 
recent trip to Iran, Orlando said.
 THE STATE WAS RANKED 
NO. 37 LAST YEAR. 
By EMILY FUGGETTA
Alligator Writer
Florida’s school system was 
ranked No. 36 in the nation in the 
American Legislative Exchange Council’s 15th annual Report Card on American Education, released 
Tuesday. 
The rank is a step up from last 
year’s No. 37 ranking and is the 
state’s highest position since 1998, but still places Florida behind about 70 percent of the country.
The council issued its rankings 
based on three underlying per-formance factors: ACT, SAT and 
National Assessment of Educational 
Progress scores, all of which Florida ranked below average. 
Although Florida fourth-grad-
ers received higher NAEP math-ematics and reading scores than the national average, eighth-graders in the same areas scored below the av-erage.
Florida’s scores were worse than 
the nation’s average ACT scores by about two points out of 30, and worse than national averages in 
SAT scores by 24 points.  State av-
erages were lower than national averages for educator salaries, per-student expenditures and teacher-student ratios.
Only 59.4 percent of students 
graduated in Florida compared to the national average of 70.2.
Graduation is a serious con-
cern across the state, according to Alachua County School District spokeswoman Jackie Johnson, who blames the problem on budget slashing, which resulted in cutting the high school day from seven pe-riods to six and slashing funds for summer school.
Without funding for seven-period days and summer school, Johnson said, it is difficult for stu-dents to graduate with 24 credits.
“It gives the kids no wiggle 
room,” she said. “If a kid fails one class, it means he’s not going to graduate on time.”
According to the report’s author, 
Andrew T. LeFevre, there is no cor-
relation between ed-ucation funding and student achievement. However, Florida 
education expenditures are notori-ously low, Johnson said.
“There are a number of state and 
national reports that make it clear 
that Florida does a terrible, terrible 
job of funding public education,” Johnson said. “Florida has essen-tially done this to itself.”
Alachua County, which has seen 
increases in graduation and African American graduation in particular, is a bright spot in Florida’s gradua-tion record, Johnson said. Alachua County has an average 
SAT score of 1090, beating Florida at 993 and the national average of 1017. 
Florida’s per-student expendi-
tures totaled $7,652, which is below the national average and between about $1,500 and $5,500 below the 
top three ranking states, Minnesota, 
Vermont and Massachusetts. 
Lawson Brown, assistant prin-
cipal of Abraham Lincoln Middle School, said that while throwing money at the school system would not immediately improve test scores and graduation rates, addi-tional funding would give schools 
more flexibility to address student 
achievement.
“The reality is that there are 
some dollar issues that limit what we can do in school,” he said.

group for lawmakers who believe in limited government, according to its Web site.

The tumbling economy has 
claimed another victim: gossip.
Citing a plunge in advertisement 
revenue and a lack of funding from 
investors, the college gossip Web 
site www.JuicyCampus.com an-
nounced it will be shutting down today.
The site, which was up and run-
ning for about a year and a half, al-lowed users at about 500 campuses across the country to post anony-mous comments about any topic of their choosing.
Many of the posts, however, had 
raunchy themes like, “Who is the sluttiest girl??????” or “Porn Star on Campus?”
Many posts referenced students 
by name.
As a result, the site was threat-
ened with lawsuits and was even investigated by the attorneys gen-
eral of at least two states.
After receiving complaints from 
students, UF Student Body President 
Kevin Reilly also sent a letter, along with former UF chief information of-ficer Marc Hoit, to Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum urging him to look into the Web site.
McCollum’s office said at the 
time that it had already been moni-toring the Web site for reasons of public safety and medical privacy.
“I think its great that it’s shutting 
down,” Reilly said on Wednesday.
“I don’t think it added anything 
positive to our community or to any other university community,” he said. “Good riddance.”
But others were less pleased.“It sucks,” said UF business 
administration sophomore Evan Fournier. “It was a good time wast-er.” 
“It shouldn’t be on (the Internet), 
but when it was on there it was kin-da funny,” he said.
Flavia Cervantes, a UF market-
ing sophomore, said she’s glad the Web site is closing but thought it wouldn’t put a stop to Internet gos-sip.
“I feel like something else will 
pop up like it,” she said.
Sure enough, users of the site 
were already discussing alterna-tives on Wednesday, such as www.

Juicy Campus shut down

Public schools inefficient, bureaucratic
Start taking notes, 
Facebook. MySpace just made social networking 
a whole lot safer.
The company announced 
Tuesday that it removed over 90,000 registered sex offenders 
from its site to help improve 
the safety of young users.
Using a program called 
Sentinel Safe, which provided MySpace with pertinent infor-
mation about sex offenders, 
the data was compared with MySpace members’ profiles to find matches. 
The efforts to curtail the 
chances of an encounter be-tween a sex offender and a child were spearheaded by the attorney generals of North 
Carolina and Connecticut, 
who strongly encouraged the change.
The Editorial Board ap-
plauds MySpace for taking a proactive approach to making social networking safer for in-nocent youngsters. While the 
substantial account removal 
is certainly a step in the right direction, more efforts can be made to ensure an unsafe en-
counter between a child and 
an offender does not occur.
We encourage Facebook 
to follow suit – regardless of its claim that a registered 
sex offender has never met 
a minor through the site. If over 90,000 offenders were found on MySpace, we can’t 
imagine how many of these 
undesirables are now lurking on Facebook, a site that boasts over 150 million users.
Now if only MySpace 
could do something about those half-naked creeps who take pictures of themselves in the mirror with their camera 
phones.On Monday, Michelle Obama officially began 
exercising her power as first lady. Making the rounds, she toured federal agencies to praise 
them and make them feel like they, despite being gov-ernment bureaucrats, are doing legitimate work.
Speaking to the U.S. Department of Education, she 
proudly spouted to a group of about 350 overpaid edu-cation bureaucrats, “I am a product of your work!”
What? I call shenanigans.She attended a selective magnet school that consis-
tently ranks as one of the top high schools in the nation 
– not exactly typical of the Chicago school system. She 
went on to attend some of the finest private schools in 
the nation.
It’s cute that the first lady wants to give the 
Department of Education a barely deserved pat on the 
back, but she is apparently oblivious to the reality of 
American public education. It’s terrible, especially 
for poor people like the ones who lived around her in Chicago. The U.S.recently ranked 18th out of 24 indus-trialized nations in education, and low-income schools are even worse than rankings reflect.
But all our problems would be solved if we had more 
funding, right? Not so much. The U.S. already spends over $9,000 per student on average -- among the highest in the world. We allocate more than $500 billion total for K-12 education, and under Obama’s plan it would add over $100 billion to the number. On a side note, I’m still not sure how spending over $100 billion in defi-cit money on education will be a short-term economic stimulus.
So if we spend so much, why is our education so 
bad? In short, the government manages to break every-thing it touches. The government doles out funds where it thinks they will best used, which often isn’t the best place. To facili-tate this, we pay billions of dollars to bureaucrats who have no direct contact whatsoever with students. Teachers unions aggravate the problem by keeping salaries low, making it impossible to hold teach-ers accountable for their work or 
fire bad ones.  
Private schools, on the other hand, are run for as 
little as one-half the cost per pupil as the government 
behemoth that is public education. They also manage to 
pay their teachers better.
The education establishment will prevent any at-
tempts to increase efficiency in the system through 
competitive solutions such as vouchers and privatiza-
tion. However, we need to do something to improve the 
allocation of funding in education. The money is there, it’s just not getting to the places it needs to be. Until it does, our education system is going to remain in the dumps and Americans will continue to struggle in a global economy.
In the meantime, the last thing we need is to have our 
first lady praising the DoE for work it didn’t do.  And we certainly don’t need her to lie to them about being their “product” to make them feel better.  
Michelle Obama attended competitive and private 
schools her entire life, and she turned out pretty well. Until everyone receives this sort of education, there’s no reason to go about praising our undeserving govern-ment.
Johnathan Lott is a political science and economics sopho-
more. His column appears on Thursdays. For Matt Ivester, the “juice” just wasn’t worth the 
squeeze.
The founder of Juicy Campus announced that the 
online gossip site will be shutting down today in the wake of 
the current economic crisis.
Students at colleges across the country can let out a col-
lective sigh of relief, as they no longer have to fear becoming 
fodder for the site’s frenzied followers.
In a world where Juicy Campus was alive and kicking, 
college coeds were forced to think twice before engaging in a 
questionable hookup or wearing bunny pajamas to lecture.
For some, waking up to see their name on the site spelled 
nothing short of social suicide. If Joe Jock spent the overnight shagging his physics TA, you could be sure someone would 
quickly bring the entire campus up to speed. The anonymous 
nature of the site meant best friends could take turns back-stabbing each other by leaking secrets without fear of reper-
cussion. 
But there was backlash.
From students ending up in jail for making threats to 
relationships ending over allegations of infidelity, one 
would be hard-pressed to identify any redeeming quality of 
JuicyCampus.com.
The Editorial Board takes delight in the fact that this de-
plorable site now ceases to exist. Perhaps Ivester created 
Juicy Campus with hopes of providing another entertaining distraction for students, but it was only a harbinger for hate.
While Juicy Campus may be no more, at least we can still 
count on Blair Waldorf to continue ruining Dan Humphrey’s life with her ill-intended texts on “Gossip Girl.”

Letters to the Editor
Keg Party here for all students
I applaud Alex Andrade for taking pride 
in the Greek community, but he has been 
misinformed.
First, Gator Growl and Homecoming 
are organized by Florida Blue Key, not the Greek community. 
Although you might have been led to be-
lieve Florida Blue Key is a Greek honorary, it is in fact the most prestigious honorary on campus. The strong correlation between Greek letters and membership in FBK is 
purely consequential. Contrary to popular 
belief, FBK does not “officially” get involved 
in campus politics.
Secondly, I encourage Alex to attend 
Senate meetings rather than blindly trust-
ing the stories of the Gator Party Senator he 
dates. 
I have seen Senators of the Gator Party, now Unite Party, support university alcohol 
regulations that would harm Greek houses.
I have seen Unite Party campaign manag-
ers punish members of Greek life for show-ing interest in other parties. 
I have seen threatening text messages 
sent by Unite Party’s leaders during votes, 
and I have seen the Unite Party promise po-
sitions to keep certain cultural organizations 
in the fold at the expense of qualified stu-dents, including Greeks.
During the Election look at the real party 
that is fighting for the students, look at the 
real party that is going to work to make sure 
the rights of Greeks are protected, look at the Keg Party.
The Keg Party is here for the Greek com-
munity, and we are here for the students.

Guest Column
Don’t you wish The Beatles 
could still make music?
They could be like the 
Stones — a geriatric revision of a once-great band, a caricature of the 
rock ‘n’ roll spirit, marred by years 
of commercial intrusion, a unrelent-ing cult of personality, a series of failed expectations and a string of lackluster albums.
Wouldn’t that be awesome? But seriously, the secret is to die 
young — just ask Elliott Smith, Kurt Cobain or Nick Drake. Oh, wait. You 
can’t. Because they’re dead, and the 
only artist who continually makes posthumous contact with his fans is Tupac (still waiting for the album in which he names his killer). 
But what if they weren’t dead? 
Or at least made it a few more years? 
Elliott could have made a video 
with Kenny Chesney, Kurt could have gone nu-metal, Nick could have done a mash-up with the Jonas Brothers. Of course, we’ll never know. But at least these guys didn’t give themselves the opportunity to massively disappoint or sicken us. 
So what’s the trade-off for artistic 
immortality? The Kurt Cobain com-plex is well-known. A young, tor-tured artist (usually fighting addic-tion or some other unwinnable war) commits suicide in the center of the world arena and fans cheer and cry and gesticulate like the audience 
of a modern-day Greek theater or 
Roman gladiatorial game. The result of their agony and catharsis is uni-versal admiration, respect and artis-tic credibility for the fallen player.
For a sick and perverse reason, 
the tragedy of the artist imbues their words of sorrow and suffering with an amount of authenticity that can’t 
be replicated by noticeably more 
content writers.In another world, the world of 
television and comedy and laugh-a-minute sitcoms, Jerry Seinfeld was able to avoid fizzling out without actually ending his life by simply 
deciding to end his sitcom before it 
jumped shark.
In his honor, I propose an em-
bargo on music creation after a cer-tain age. It can be called the Jerry Seinfeld law, and it can ban musi-cians from creating more than five albums in order to avoid a debacle that would strip them of their previ-
ously earned credibility.
The artist would be able to over-turn this mandate and make a sixth 
album, but they would have to sign a contract committing themselves to suicide after the recording process. That way, in case the album is a criti-
cal failure, the artist can still achieve 
mythical status through hubris. 
Just think – we wouldn’t have to 
groan at any more Rolling Stones albums and only one more post- “College Dropout” Kanye West al-bum.
Seriously, where does one go af-
ter auto-tune?

Nearly 150 students were chosen out of the 
roughly 400 senator hopefuls who stopped by 
during three days of interviews. 
The Unite Party was the only party to sub-
mit candidates for all 50 seats. The Progress 
Party and the Orange and Blue Party came in six and four seats short, respectively, of filling their entire ticket.The Keg Party dropped out of the running 
for Senate seats, but will run an executive tick-et, said Frank Bracco, party president.  Each party will meet this week to discuss issues to focus on in the upcoming season. Unite Party President Will Harrell said the meeting will be used for team-building.  
“We’re all going to have to become good 
friends pretty soon,” Harrell said.
Orange and Blue Party President Donte 
Hargrove said he was pleased with his party’s overall ticket and student turnout.
“We had a lot of young students come 
out,” he said, adding this surge of underclass-men may have stemmed from the recent pres-idential election, piquing students’ interest in politics.
The Progress Party’s communications di-
rector Eric Conrad also spoke about the in-
creased number of younger students.
“We had a good turnout of younger people 
and new ideas,” he said, adding the party had 
many freshman and sophomore candidates. The Progress Party also snagged former 
president of the LAN Party, Kevin Seymour, who joined Progress after a low turnout in in-terviews with his own party.                                      
Conrad said a party meeting this week will 
prepare the candidates, “so they can avoid pit-falls and get into hardcore campaigning.”
Bracco, of the Keg Party, announced the 
party’s executive candidates as presidential candidate Frank Walch and, candidates for 
vice president and treasurer, Russel Ward and 
Elizabeth Stinson. Walch said there was little to no chance the Keg Party would win.
“Our main goal is to make a statement,” he 
said.   SG parties submit candidates for open Senate seats
“We’re all going to have to be-
come good friends pretty soon.”

Stephanie Granada shares tips and tricks on how to rock 
menswear better than the boys.
Sex columnist Ashley Ross points out how to tell if someone is “just 
not that into you.” Also, Lee Ziesche scopes out the art scene at 
the Wayward Council benefit Friday. Don’t miss reviews of “The

the way I’m playing my part in helping is doing a lot 
of shopping wherever I go.
Paris Hilton If all this talk of a recession is going way over your head, you can still 
help boost the economy without altering your spending habits. 
1)Wolfgang:  If you don’t know the difference between Sears and 
Saks, this store probably isn’t for you. But if the Oaks Mall just isn’t 
cutting it, Wolfgang caters to your high-end fashion needs, carrying 
everything from Citizens of Humanity to Diesel. 
2)Maude’s Classic Café:  Coffee culture is alive and thriving in the 
heart of downtown Gainesville. Forget Starbucks. At Maude’s, you can 
drink your coffee and brush up on your Connect 4 skills at the same 
time.  
3)Store 101 : If a gallery and a boutique had a lovechild, it would be 
Store 101. Anticipate a shopping experience — the good kind. 
4)Mother Earth Market:  Publix has nothing on Mother Earth Market. 
Even if you’re not a health nut, there’s nothing trendier than organic 
goods and fresh produce. Just don’t forget your reusable shopping 
bag.     
5)Emiliano’s Café:  Sharing never looked so good. Grab a few friends 
and order from the tapas menu for an instant family-style meal. You’ll 
never eat at Chipotle again.

Menswear 
no longer 
just for
men 
 In 1930, Marlene Dietrich was the 
first woman to wear men’s clothing in 
a major motion picture. In “Morocco,” Dietrich shimmies her way across a nightclub stage wearing a tuxedo. The 
world was shocked. 
Later, Katharine Hepburn followed 
suit, wearing the loose, pleated trou-
sers the style icon is known for. 
Some women followed her example, 
but menswear wasn’t popularized in the women’s fashion world until Diane Keaton wore vests, trousers and tie as Annie Hall in Woody Allen’s film. 
Since then, women have rocked mens-
wear, sometimes doing it better than the boys. 
At the most basic level, a classic 
jean and fitted tee is the go-to outfit for many girls. Cowboys have been working the look since Levi Strauss emerged in 1853, but girls take it out of the country and into everyday cute. 
 This season, menswear for women 
is as popular as ever. Fashion shows sent girls down runways in slouchy pants and blazers, tailored trousers and v-necks, cuffed boyfriend jeans and tank tops. And Yves Saint Laurent and the Chloe Sevigny label have an-nounced soon-to-come unisex lines.
The man-on-woman craze, exem-
plified best by YSL, Alexander Wang and Ralph Lauren, is fueled by the simplicity and ease of the pieces. Men’s clothing that is well-made and tailored instantly makes the person wearing it 
look pulled together and stylish. 
Menswear gives women the ability 
to wear clothing that is comfortable 
and durable, without having to pass up on style or elegance.  
The guise is done best when girls 
make use of their femininity to frame the clothes. There has to be balance. 
If the pants are loose, the top should 
be fitted and show some skin. Tight pants call for a blazer or other more structured pieces.
The style is in the details with this 
look. Jewelry, hair and makeup can take the ensemble from casual to night-wear. During the day, light makeup, loose wavy hair and delicate jewelry will keep femininity in the air. 
At night, turn femme with bold 
custom jewelry, eccentric heels and dramatic makeup. Sexiness doesn’t go out the window with these clothes. 
Menswear-inspired clothing is 
most appealing for what it says about the woman wearing it. She exudes confidence and strength. She doesn’t rely on cleavage and leg to show her 
allure, because she doesn’t have to. 
Who would have thought before 
ladies like Dietrich and Hepburn ap-
peared on the scene that it would take a woman to dress like a man?STEPHANIE GRANADA  
AVENUE WRITER
Menswear gives women the 
ability to wear clothing that 
is comfortable and durable, without 
having to pass up on style 
or elegance.  ““12, ALLIGATOR  THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 2009
With a new EP/demo under 
their belt coming out in mid-March, 
and a lineup of upcoming shows, 
the band Dear Dakota is keeping 
busy and ready to take on a new 
stage. Originally hailing from the 
Gainesville and Ocala area, their 
music is filled with quirky lyrics 
and catchy melodies. 
Not only are they passion -
ate about the sheer joy of playing 
music, but they are philanthro -
pists. With a new merchandise 
line with Loveless Apparel, being 
named one of the top six unsigned 
bands in the world by “Alternative 
Press” magazine, and an expand -
ing tour agenda, they are not stop -
ping short of anything. 
Describing their sound like that 
of Steve Perry (Journey) with a mix -
ture of the Police and Taking Back 
Sunday, guitarist James Patrick 
and bassist/vocalist Tyler Cole 
give their take on the fans, the new 
demo and most importantly, the 
music. Dear Dakota will be play -
ing at a few schools in Gainesville 
throughout February and March.
You guys originally hail from 
Gainesville. Does this pose as 
a barrier in terms of furthering 
your music?
James:  You definitely gotta hold down your hometown and 
get support from the people that 
have been there from the start. It’s 
always good to get out there and 
play in bigger cities. But it’s always 
nice to play Gainesville because 
you have all your friends here and 
it’s comfortable.
Do you have any ties to the 
University of Florida, and how 
do you think 
you can influ -
ence the college 
crowd with your 
music?
James:  That’s 
kind of the trick 
in Gainesville, 
because it is the 
biggest market, 
getting college 
people to listen to your music, it’s 
kind of hard to crack into.  There’s 
a lot of Greek stuff and they’re 
locked in. Back in the ‘70s you 
would go to watch a rock band or 
a blues band, but nowadays the 
clubs are different.
Tyler:  We’ve played frat houses, 
we’ve played in front of the book -
store, we played Ben Hill Griffin 
- all over Gainesville. I’m a huge 
Gator fan, born and raised; this is 
where I would have gone to school if I wasn’t doing this right now.
Where do the ideas/inspira -
tions come from for the content of 
your songs?
Tyler:  Anywhere and every -
where, you know. It can be any -
where from ‘man I don’t feel good’ 
to other times your girlfriend will 
have you down or another time 
you’ll be in a really good mood 
and loving life. 
James:  We’ve 
been trying to 
write happier 
songs - a lot of 
the stuff we 
went through 
as a band was 
negative. Like I 
said you know, 
our drummer is 
all about the hardcore metal, I’m 
more of the pop and rock, our lead 
guitarist is more of a jazz/blues 
guy. It’s wherever the inspiration 
strikes you.
So you guys go for a diverse 
sound?
James:  We definitely want di -
versity and we want to be around. 
We don’t just want to put out a CD 
and have one for a few years.
Tyler:  We can range from a Circa 
Survive sound to Foo Fighters to Incubus. Our influences are very 
broad…if we could be like any 
band it would be Incubus.
You guys have faced many 
challenges. How did you rebound 
after the death of the founder/
bassist Adam Arbitman?
Tyler:  For me it was definitely 
a rehab, a way for me to get myself 
together. He was one of my best 
friends. It was weird, once I took 
his place it was like I was continu -
ing what he wanted to do. I know 
if I passed away, I would want him 
to do it the same way.  
James:   It was really weird. I 
didn’t accept it. I just denied it…
there was never a moment where I 
was like ‘this is going to be the end 
of our band.’ It’s cool to have Tyler 
around for so long…we played 
different shows together…once we 
got over the fact…it was kinda cool 
that it worked out so peacefully af -
ter something like that.
What is your reaction to the 
tough nature of making it in the 
music industry?
James:  You have to love it 
or give it up; there’s no middle 
ground. I’ll go out with friends 
and you’ll meet people and they 
ask “so what’s your backup plan,” 
and I say there is no backup plan. We’re all about this and nothing 
else. This is the only option I have 
for myself.  
Recently, you guys have played 
some philanthropic shows. How 
was that?  Where did you guys 
play?
Tyler:  It was a fundraiser (at a 
middle school). It was scary. There 
were like 700 kids in the cafeteria. 
We walked out and the kids were 
so excited that we were playing. 
Zane (lead singer) came out and 
they were like shoving toward him 
and trying to touch his hand.
So, what should fans expect at 
the show?  Do you guys do any 
special tricks or have surprises for 
the people attending?
James:  To sweat and party. 
We just want fans to have a good 
time. We do some improv. We did 
a “Beat It” cover not too long ago 
and we had an encore. The fans 
wouldn’t stop ‘til we came back, so 
we had like an hour long set. We 
like when older people come and 
we appeal to all ages.
Tyler:  We just like to see people 
singing in the crowd. You see like 
20-year-olds there with their moms 
or something and I think that’s 
cool to be able to reach out to that 
many people.with DEAR DAKOTA
 It’s always good to get out 
there and play in bigger 
cities. But it’s always nice 
to play Gainesville because you 
have all your friends here and it’s 
comfortable.

By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
GREENSBORO — They say it takes a 
village to raise a child. For Gary Brown, it 
took that much to pick a school.
“I can’t even begin to count the number 
of people (who have helped with the deci-
sion),” said Elesha Brown, Gary’s mother. “Some of it was as far as spiritual guidance 
… different types of experiences that other 
people have been through.”
Between the parents, principals, coach-
es, pastors, school board members and 
uncles, practically half of Greensboro was 
in the West Gadsden High media center Wednesday morning as Brown announced his decision to play football at UF.
Brown, a 6-foot-3, 275-pound defensive 
tackle, committed to the Gators last March but was rumored to favor Florida State lately. 
He eased coach Urban Meyer’s anxiety 
a few hours before going public with his decision.
“(I) told him, ‘It’s great to be a Gator,’ 
and I had a nice little conversation with him,” Brown said.
The defensive tackle said a football 
scholarship wasn’t always in his plans. Brown originally had dreams of playing baseball and was a pitcher and first base-man. 
He described his feelings the first day he played football in high school as “ner-
vous.”
“My uncle said, ‘You ready to be a 
Bulldog?’ And I said, ‘Yeah, sure.’ Boy was 
I nervous.”
Brown, a strong Baptist, says he would 
one day like to become a pastor. Elesha has been taking him to church since he was born and believes her son has been a good role model for his two younger sisters, 
Tarra and Stephanie.
His mother wasn’t the only one to 
anoint Brown as a role model. 
West Gadsden’s principal, Sylvia 
Jackson, said Brown has 
shown other students the im-portance of academic success to an athletic career.
A member of the county 
school board said he expects 
Brown to come back to Greensboro — after winning a national championship with UF, he noted — and reach out to the children.
“I can promise, when I go to school, I’m 
coming back and helping this communi-ty,” Brown said.
The community has put so much em-
phasis on Brown’s ability to impact his 
surroundings off the field that his abili-
ties as a football player were almost over-looked Wednesday. 
The West Gadsden lineman let it be 
known that he hopes to compete immedi-ately and that he will be hitting the weights hard until June, when he will move to 
Gainesville.
But while playing time, and eventually 
a national championship will be his on-field mission, it is not his ultimate goal.
“Truly, without (God), I would be noth-
ing,” Brown said. “I plan on leading a lot 
of people to Christ.”

 THE CLASS IS UF’S SMALL -
EST UNDER URBAN MEYER.

The fax machine was quieter than 
usual this year in the UF football of-
fice, and Gators coach Urban Meyer 
couldn’t be happier about it.
After signing 22-plus players in 
each of the last three seasons, Meyer 
brought in 16 signees Wednesday, 
and the smaller size of the 2009 re-
cruiting class is mostly because UF didn’t have many holes to fill.
The entire defense will return to 
Gainesville for next season, as will a large number of offensive play-
makers, leaving Meyer with a more 
manageable class that’s less likely to result in players transferring due to lack of playing time.
“This is right where we want 
to be,” Meyer said at his National Signing Day press conference. “We want to have 18 to 21 every year. If we’re doing a good job and we 
don’t have a mass exodus of juniors 
to the NFL, we should be right there.
“If you had said, ‘Coach, where 
do you want to be four years into the program?’ Right here.”

One of the biggest challenges facing the 
2009 UF football team will be staying hun-
gry and humble despite two national titles 
in three years, and the Gators’ two newest 
coaches should be a big help in that depart-ment.
Quarterbacks coach Scot Loeffler and 
tight ends coach Brian White won’t enter next season with the same fond memories of 2008 that their players will. 
While UF rumbled to a championship, 
Loeffler’s and White’s teams were a com-
bined 0-28, but they expect the lessons 
learned during their tough seasons to pay off in the future.
“I think I lost more games last year than I lost in my entire football career, but it was humbling,” Loeffler said. 
“That’s the wonderful thing about the 
game of football: You’ve never arrived. You 
can be on top of the world and get kicked 
square in the rear end.”
And Loeffler was kicked hard. After 
coaching quarterbacks at Michigan from 2002-07, he spent a year in the same position 
with the Detroit Lions, and they amassed New coaches Loeffler, White

SIGNED WITH ALABAMA.

PENSACOLA — Trent 
Richardson tried to keep his deci-
sion secret until the last minute, but his brothers tipped his hand 
by revealing a houndstooth hat.
As hundreds of Escambia High 
students and teachers filled the me-dia center awaiting Richardson’s 
announcement, the highly touted running back’s brothers came 
in wearing UF, Alabama and 
LSU baseball caps. On their way past the desk where Richardson 
would make his decision known, 
a hat made famous by legendary Crimson Tide coach Paul “Bear” 
Bryant was, perhaps accidentally, 
revealed.
Just like that, UF’s small hope 
of landing Richardson died.
For all of Urban Meyer’s ac-
complishments since joining UF 
in 2005 — two national champi-
onships, two SEC titles and the creation of an entertaining and balanced offense — he has never 
been able to recruit a power run-
ning back who can take the bulk of the carries.
Meyer tried to change that 
this year by hosting Richardson on an 
official visit that the 
tailback described to Rivals.com as “a 
perfect 10.” The UF 
coach followed this up with an in-
home visit last week.
But in the end, Richardson 
stayed with the team he’s been committed to since last June.“I look at it really like a mar-
riage,” Richardson said. “I mean, you can see yourself with a girl that’s been with you more than 
one that’s just tagging along with 
you.”
It was believed UF would not 
have a chance of landing a grind-it-out back of Richardson’s caliber because the Gators’ spread does 
not favor that style, something the 
Escambia star denied.
“I feel very comfortable with the 
I-formation, (but) I like Florida’s offense too,” Richardson said. “The thing about their offense is they do basically about the same 
things except put you in space.”
The Gators may not have had a 
single back of Richardson’s caliber under Meyer, but they have been 
able to balance their attack. Last season’s team had four players 
rush for over 600 yards.
UF has been able to bring in 
speed players who thrive in the open-space style of the spread-
option like Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey.
The last UF running back to 
rush for over 1,000 yards in a sea-son was Ciatrick Fason in 2004. Meyer’s clout not enough to rip Richardson from Tide

They’re doing it again.
No. 11 UF (20-2, 6-1 Southeastern 
Conference) is on another winning streak, not yet as long as the first, but all of these wins have been against conference foes.
The number currently sits at five, and to-
night at 7 the Gators will try to boost that fig-ure to six when they travel to take on a reel-ing Alabama (12-10, 0-7 SEC) team.
Of course, UF coach Amanda Butler doesn’t get caught up in all the hoopla of winning streaks.
“I don’t think we sit here and think about, 
‘Well, if we win Thursday, that’ll be six in a row,’” Butler said. 
“We’re just really focused every single 
time on let’s win the next one. If you keep your focus really simple, that’s when you tend to see those things happen.”
After the Gators’ loss in the first game of 
the season at Florida Gulf Coast, they reeled off 15 straight victories.
If they were to go on another 15-game 
winning streak now, they would hold the SEC regular season and tournament titles, with the 15th game being the tournament championship.
“That would be nice,” junior guard Susan 
Yenser said. “A double 15-game winning streak.”
Since UF’s second loss of the year at then-No. 9 Auburn on Jan. 11, UF has manhandled five SEC opponents by an average of 16.4 points per game, the closest win by 14 at South Carolina.
More importantly, two of those wins came 
on the road, and that is probably the biggest 
challenge the Gators will face against the 
Crimson Tide.
“Our hardest task in the SEC is to play 
on the road,” Yenser said. “So we don’t take anybody lightly on the road. 
“We just know that we’ve got to bring it 
night in and night out against any SEC op-ponent. Anybody can beat anybody.” Gators try for sixth straight win against reeling Alabama

The Gators lost two verbal commits at 
the last second but added two big pros-
pects, including one who may be remem-
bered as the centerpiece of the class.
Jelani Jenkins, widely regarded as the 
nation’s best outside linebacker, chose 
UF over Penn State, Southern Cal, Notre 
Dame and Stanford, and it’s hard to imag-
ine a better fit for Meyer than the 6-foot-1, 200-pounder.
Jenkins, just 16 years old, boasts a per-
fect grade point average and the speed to 
run a 4.4-second 40-yard dash and is a fi-
nalist for the high school equivalent of the Heisman Trophy, the Watkins Award.
He even devised a three-page matrix 
with his family to help him choose a col-lege. 
“I’ll be disappointed if he’s not a cap-
tain at Florida someday,” said Meyer, who added that Jenkins committed to him a 
week ago.
Along with four-star defensive back 
Josh Evans — who also chose UF on 
Wednesday — Jenkins gives the recruiting class some luster.
“(Jenkins) shows exactly what this 
Florida class is about: potential,” said Scout.com recruiting analyst Miller Safrit. 
“I think some people may have looked at 
this class and been upset about it, but add-ing Jenkins completely changes that.”
While Jenkins and Evans provided the 
Gators a boost, two others turned in their UF gear for a different shade of orange. 
Pahokee High receiver Nu’Keese 
Richardson and Paris (Tenn.) defensive back Marsalis Teague — both four-star 
prospects — broke off their verbal com-
mitments to sign with Tennessee.
That was a major coup for the 
Volunteers’ new head coach, Lane Kiffin, 
who made it clear he’d be gunning for the 
Gators at his introductory press confer-ence when he said he most looked forward to “singing ‘Rocky Top’ all night long after we beat Florida next year.”
Even with those losses and defensive 
back Greg Reid — who committed to UF in his junior season — signing with Florida State, the Gators came away with a class 
that will plug all the necessary holes.
“I’d give it an ‘A’ for fitting needs,” 
Safrit said.
“The loss of a couple of guys here at the 
end probably kept it from being an A-plus. When you look at it, they fit all the needs 
they had, but a big portion of that is they didn’t have many needs. With what they have coming back, they probably should get an A-plus just for keeping Brandon 
Spikes and Tim Tebow.”
There’s no question about who Meyer’s 
favorite player in the class is. 
Sanford Seminole High receiver Andre 
Debose drew high praise from his new 
coach, who expects him to fill the role of NFL-bound playmaker Percy Harvin.
“I’ve got to tell you, this Andre Debose 
— I know I can’t single guys out, but I’m 
going to single him out,” Meyer said. 
“He’s as good as there is. I think he’s 
the best player in America. … Before I 
came down here, I flipped on his highlight 
tape one more time so I’ll leave with a big smile on my face.”
The Gators also added five offensive 
linemen to replenish the gap left by gradu-
ates Jim Tartt, Phil Trautwein and Jason Watkins, and they may get another player 
in the coming days.
Meyer hinted during his press confer-
ence that one more would sign, and Tampa 
Plant High tight end Orson Charles is a likely candidate.
Charles, rated the nation’s No. 3 tight 
end by Scout.com, made headlines in 2007 when he accidentally broke UF’s 2006 na-tional championship trophy on a recruit-
ing visit.Meyer beams after signing wideout Debose to fill hole left by Harvin

an 0-16 record, the worst in NFL 
history.
White coached at Washington 
last season, when the Huskies went 0-12, and he noticed a dif-ference between the Gators and his former team right away.
“The difference is the way 
people carry themselves,” White said. 
“Athletes are walking around 
with a tremendous amount of 
confidence, and there are a lot of smiles. It’s nice to be around. I’ve 
been a part of that atmosphere a lot in the past, but the past three 
years has not been like that. It’s 
very refreshing.”
The pair will get a pick-me-up 
from a couple of talented athletes at their positions. 
Loeffler will guide quarter-
back Tim Tebow in his quest for a second Heisman Trophy and successful NFL career, while 
White will tutor tight end Aaron 
Hernandez, one of the nation’s best.
Loeffler, who played quar-terback at Michigan, recruited Tebow when he was with the Wolverines, and he is excited 
about the chance to finally work 
with him.
“As a quarterback 
and a quarterbacks 
coach, you always 
pride yourself in 
having a tough guy 
out there,” Loeffler said. 
“We have one. He’s a war 
daddy, as they would say. He’s unbelievable.”
Loeffler added that Tebow can 
“without a doubt” be a successful pro quarterback, and that coach Urban Meyer has just one rule for him. 
“All coach Meyer said is, 
‘Don’t screw him up,’” Loeffler said. 
“We’ll try not to screw him 
up, that’s for sure.”
White, a Harvard graduate, 
will take over the tight end po-sition as it becomes increasingly important to the Gators’ offense. 
Without a clear-cut No. 1 re-
ceiver, UF is likely to turn to Hernandez often, and White sees a high ceiling for his player, along with room for improvement.
“I think most importantly, 
it’s just some on-the-line consis-
tency with blocking,” White said. 
“That’s the first area where he can vastly improve. 
“He’s so athletic that he should 
dominate on and off the line of 
scrimmage. 
“He has every tool that you 
need to be as good a tight end as 
there is in the country, and we’re 
going to challenge him to be the 
best tight end in America this year.”
Loeffler looks to guide Tebow to second Heisman, develop QB into NFL-ready player
