A 19-year-old man was beaten and robbed 
in the tunnel under Southwest 13th Street 
connecting Norman Hall and the Yulee area early Monday.
The victim recalls that three white men 
were also in the tunnel at the time he was hit in the back of his head about 3 a.m., accord-ing to a University Police Department press release.
The investigation is ongoing as of Mon-
day, UPD Lt. Alton McDilda said, and the police will be increasing patrols in the Nor-man and Yulee areas.
The victim, who is not a student, called 
police about 8 a.m., McDilda said.
“He came to us five hours [after the 
crime],” McDilda said. “He did not show any signs of inebriation or anything like that.”
The victim may have become unconscious 
when the crime happened, he said.
“He didn’t complain of 
any injuries other than he got hit in the back of the head,” McDilda said. “There weren’t 
any visible wounds.”
The University Police Department sent 
emergency text message and e-mail notifica-tions Monday morning to UF students, fac-ulty and staff.
“The possessions we’re not releasing at 
this time,” McDilda said. “The estimates, I couldn’t ballpark it right now to tell you the truth.
The robber or robbers may face charges of 
strong-arm robbery, a felony. Anyone who knows anything about the incident should contact the UPD office at 352-392-1111.

EVANSVILLE, Wis. (AP) — A Wiscon-
sin man is accused of secretly videotaping young children at a Florida nude beach.
Sheriff's officials released a statement 
Monday saying the man is scheduled to make an initial court appearance Tuesday in Rock County.
Florida authorities say the 42-year-old 
had been seen recording the children Fri-day. Wisconsin detectives got a search war-rant that same day and searched his Evans-ville home.
They allegedly found child pornography 
and multiple camera systems. They arrested the man Sunday night on 62 tentative charg-es of possession of child pornography.
Evansville is about 25 miles south of 
Madison.
The statement didn't say where in Flor-
ida the beach was. A telephone message left with the sheriff was not immediately returned.

Squishy the Gerbil might be UF’s least-
known mascot. 
This is probably because Florida Ulti-
mate’s A-Team just bought him on Friday as it began the USA Ultimate College Champi-
onships series in Madison, Wis. 
Squishy brought good luck, as Florida 
defeated Carleton College 15-12 in the tour-nament finals Monday afternoon, giving the team the national championship.
Florida won six of seven games over the weekend, culminating in the victory over Carleton College.
“We never were really tested by any 
other team,” said senior team member and captain Chris Gibson. “They are kind of our rivals, and we didn’t even get to play until this match.” The Florida Ulitmate stayed calm 
throughout the game, even facing a team whose school “put[s] a Frisbee in every stu-dent’s preview bag,” he said. 
Florida was seeded No. 4 with a 15-game 
win streak going into the tournament; before the weekend, they were 32-5.

Cardboard tombstones, em-
broidered cloths and anti-war 
signs decorated Northwest Eighth Avenue on Memorial Day as Gainesville’s chapter of 
Veterans for Peace honored the 
lives of service men and wom-en who have died in Afghani-stan and Iraq since 2001. 
A display of 5,473 cardboard 
tombstones, one for every sol-dier killed in the wars, lined both sides of Northwest Eighth 
Avenue on Monday. Visitors 
and volunteers placed flags on the tombstones of soldiers they knew personally. This 
year, members of Veterans for 
Peace, a national organization that opposes war as a legiti-mate means of conflict resolu-tion, and volunteers from their sister group, CodePink, had to 
plant some tombstones along-
side the north side of the road because there was no more room on the south side.
Scott Camil, who is the co-
ordinator for the Gainesville chapter, said this was the fourth year that the group 
has set up the memorial and 
doesn’t know what they’ll do if they run out of space in the future.
“You’d think it wouldn’t 
come to that,” he said, “that we would realize before then that this [war] is not working.” 
Camil said the group re-
ceived mostly support from passers-by, but he was upset after he learned that about 100 tombstones had been dug out 
early Sunday morning and 
were thrown into the woods.   
Volunteers did not see those Tombstones pay 
tribute to soldiers

The $9.7-million cut in state 
funding for Shands at UF, which 
was approved by Gov. Charlie 
Crist on Friday, will likely ad-versely affect Florida’s under- and uninsured patients, accord-ing to a Shands press release. 
“Elimination of this criti-
cal revenue source for Shands at UF was totally unexpected,” said Shands HealthCare CEO 
Tim Goldfarb in the  release. 
“It is vital to supporting our re-sponsibility to care for Florida’s most vulnerable and neediest residents.”
Shands at UF will likely lose an additional $12 million in fed-
eral funding through the Med-
icaid match program, according to the release.
A safety-net hospital pro-
vides care to low-income, un-insured or vulnerable popula-tions, according to the National 
Association of Pub-lic Hospitals and 
Health Systems’ 
website.
As one of 14 safety-net hos-
pitals in the state, Shands “is 
among the largest Medicaid and 
charity care providers in Florida and we have a strong sense of commitment to serve those with little or no insurance,” Goldfarb 
said.State-funding cut

VENICE, La. — As hurricane 
season begins, the oil spill in the 
Gulf of Mexico takes weather ex-perts into uncharted waters.
The Gulf is a superhighway 
for hurricanes that form or ex-plode over pools of hot water, then usually move north or west toward the coast. The site of the sunken rig is along the general path of some of the worst storms ever recorded, including Hur-ricane Camille, which wiped out the Mississippi coast in 1969, and 
Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
The season officially starts 
today, and while scientists seem 
to agree that the sprawling slick isn’t likely to affect the formation of a storm, the real worry is that a hurricane might turn the millions of gallons of floating crude into a crashing black surf.
Some fear a combination of 
damaging winds and large waves pushing oil deeper into estuaries and wetlands and coating miles of coast in a sticky mess.And the worst effects of an oil-
soaked storm surge might not be 
felt for years: If oil is pushed deep 
into coastal marshes that act as a natural speed bump for storm surges, areas including New Or-leans could be more vulnerable to bad storms for a long time. Experts say there are few, if any, studies on  the scenario. 
In this “untreaded water ... it’s 
tough to theo-rize about what would hap-pen,” said Joe Bastardi, chief 
l o n g - r a n g e hurricane fore-caster with AccuWeather.
com.
The lone precedent, experts 
agree, is the summer of 1979, 
when storms hampered efforts to contain a spill from a Mexican rig called Ixtoc 1 that eventually dumped 140 million gallons off the Yucatan Peninsula. Hurri-cane Henri, a Category 1 storm, 
damaged a 310-ton steel cap de-signed to stop the leak that would 
become the worst peacetime spill.
While oil from that spill coated 
beaches in Texas and Mexico, tropical storms and unseason-able cold fronts that year helped reverse offshore currents earlier than normal and drive oil away from the coast. Storms also helped disperse oil, Bastardi said.
“That’s what I think would 
happen this time,” he said. “I’m sure a hurricane would do a great deal of diluting the oil, spreading it out where the concentrations would be much less damaging.”
At least 19 million gallons, 
according to the latest estimates, have leaked from the seabottom 5,000 feet below the surface since 
April 20. Bastardi said the storms 
themselves remain the chief threat.
“If a Category 3 hurricane is 
headed to the Texas Gulf Coast — and this is simply theoretical — I wouldn’t be worried as much about damage from the oil, as the damage from the hurricane,” 
Bastardi said.

UF students built a house, tore it down 
and are now building it again.
A team of 31 UF students constructed 
the solar-powered house to compete with 
19 universities from around the world in 
the Solar Decathlon Europe competition in 
Spain.
The project was led by the Rinker School 
of Building Construction and the College of Journalism and Communications. 
Eleven students are in Spain reconstruct-
ing the house for the competition, which will be held from June 18 to June 27 in Ma-drid. The other 20 students will arrive later 
this week to finish the details of the house, 
said Paige Mainor, a team member.
The 800-square-foot house was built at 
the UF Solar Energy Park in Gainesville with help of more than 125 UF students from four colleges, said Kathryn Watson, a communications director for the project.
In April, the house was dismantled 
and shipped in five containers  to Madrid, 
where some of the students began recon-
struction, said Maruja Torres-Antonini, the project’s co-principal investigator.
During the competition, contestants 
will be judged in 10 categories, ranging from architectural quality to comfort lev-els. There is no monetary prize, but win-ners will receive “eternal glory,” along with honor and positive attention for their 
school, Watson said.
The construction of the house built in 
Gainesville cost less than $500,000, Torres-
Antonini said. Student Government also donated $7,200 in April to the group so more students could make the trip, accord-ing to Alligator archives.
After the competition, the house will 
be disassembled and shipped back to 
Gainesville. It will then become a perma-
nent display at the Florida Museum of Natural History.UF students

The Florida Public Service Commission 
approved a plan on Thursday to build a 
100-megawatt biomass plant at the Gainesville 
Regional Utilities facility in Deerhaven. 
The plant is a joint-effort between GRU 
and American Renewables, an energy plant 
developing company.
“The PSC has taken an important step to-day toward significantly expanding Florida’s commitment to renewable energy,” said Jim Gordon, American Renewables chief execu-tive officer, in a press release. “The Gainesville Renewable Energy Center will bring reliable, cost-effective renewable energy to GRU cus-
tomers and spur significant economic development in 
North Central Florida.”
GRU and American Re-
newables are entering into a 30-year energy 
contract under which American Renewables will build, own and operate the facility, ac-cording to the release.
GRU will buy and use 100 percent of the plant’s energy output, which will be gener-ated by burning local leftovers from logging residue and wood processing plants.
The biomass plant will help keep GRU’s 
facilities updated, as well as protect custom-ers from rising fuel costs while providing long-term savings, said GRU General Manag-er Bob Hunzinger in the release. At first, cus-
tomers may see a small increase in their bills, 
although it is expected that biomass energy will soon become less expensive than fossil-fuel alternatives, the release stated.
Construction is set to begin in December, 
although customers will not be directly influ-enced until late 2013, the release stated.Gainesville biomass plant approved

Biden's speech at Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day in Arlington, Va.
senior and captain Brodie Smith, who was the runner-up 
this year for the Callahan Award, which goes to the most valuable player in the nation. 
“That award didn’t really matter to me,” Smith said. Sophomore Alan Baird, one of the team’s three under-
classmen at nationals, agreed. 
“We didn’t want it to affect us this year, whether he 
wanted it or not,” Baird said. 
The team is kind of like a miniature sports fraternity, said 
senior Cole Sullivan. 
During the school year, five of the teammates live togeth-
er in a house dubbed “The Glory Hole.” During the weeks between the end of spring semester and the tournament in Madison, more of the team piled in.
“We just lined up,” Gibson said. “We stacked extra mat-
tresses next to mine in the living room. All we did was play Frisbee and live at the Glory Hole,” said Gibson.
Whether it was the gerbil, the gaming, the 
cozy sleeping quarters or just the frequent prac-tices, something was working for the team. 
“It was the best three weeks you can pos-
sibly have when you are sleeping on the floor, when you are sharing it with three people and [there’s] no air condition-
ing,” Baird said.
Despite setbacks such as losing seniors like Smith, as 
well as coach Jonathan Windham, who moved away from 
Gainesville in April, the players are optimistic for next year.
Unlike Baird and Sullivan, Squishy the Gerbil is probably 
not looking forward to next year’s season. The same day that team members bought him, they put him in a plastic gerbil ball and took him along while they played a game of disc golf.
“We put the ball inside this bush, so he could stay there 
until we were done with our playing,”  Gibson said. When the team returned from the game, the top of the ball was off and Squishy was gone. Gibson listed three possibilities: an animal got to Squishy, another person liberated him, or he “was really athletic and opened it himself.” 
Next year, with or without an escape-prone rodent for a 
mascot, the team expects further success. 
“We’re a program,” Baird said, “not a team. We’re a dy-
nasty.”Captain was runner-

Today’s question: Should UF’s campus be a smoke-free zone?
92 TOTAL VOTES49% YES51% NOThursday’s question: Are you traveling for Memorial Day weekend?Up in smoke
Students only have one 
more month to smoke on campus before it 
is officially banned. Let the countdown begin.
On-campus smokers are 
usually the kind of people who keep to themselves. You can usually spot them in that little alcove around Turling-ton, the less-populated part of the sidewalk or in various other locations tucked away behind buildings or off the 
beaten path.
Apparently that is not 
enough for the good folks at 
UF, who have given smok-ers a firm deadline of July 1 to quit lighting up on cam-pus. We think the university could do a little better than that – why not make every-
one healthier by taking away 
the right to put anything un-healthy in their bodies.
Come July 1, we want to 
see Cheeburger Cheeburger closnig its doors and Subway only serving Jared-approved sandwiches with less than five grams of fat. Want that Chick-fil-A sandwich fried? Sorry, you are going to have to settle for half a grilled one without a bun. Thinking of 
picking up a Pepsi? Hope you 
like the sugarless, caffeine-free variety.
Smoking is a choice that 
people should be allowed to make on their own. So long as they are not blowing smoke in other people’s faces, it real-ly only affects them. It simply 
is not the university’s right to 
make that choice for anyone.
If it has to do with cigarette 
butts being scattered around campus, then they can fine people for littering. If it has to do with smokers lighting up in inappropriate place, then take a page from Santa Fe’s 
book and put down a few 
designated smoking areas. 
If it has to do with any-
thing else though, then UF should quit being hypocriti-cal and take away everything unhealthy and fun from ev-eryone.Inhospitable
Crist vetoes $9.7 million 
for Shands funding
Things just got a little more difficult for the under-in-
sured and uninsured.
Gov. Charlie Crist pushed through the $70.2 bil-
lion state budget on Friday after cutting out $371 million in projects and spending, including $9.7 million in funding for Shands at UF. The money was cut from programs that would help the hospital care for patients who cannot afford treat-ment.
The cut is going to directly affect the people who need the 
funding the most. People who cannot afford medical care are not going to magically find a way to come up with another $9.7 million.
These cuts are going to force some tough decisions to be 
made by the Shands higher-ups. They may have to restrict 
the number of people who can get care or where people must 
live in order to be eligible for free or reduced-cost care.
This is a position no doctor wants to be in. They are com-
mitted to helping everyone possible remain healthy and live a full life, but this cut in funding makes that an impossibil-ity.
Shands is the leading teaching hospital in the state, and 
everyone should have the opportunity to take advantage of the services offered if they need.
The newly independent Charlie Crist should be ashamed 
of himself. If he was not already facing some dire straits po-litically we would have to advocate against him in his up-coming race for the U.S. Senate.
Like most college students, I am quite tied to my Fa-
cebook account and have put much of my life on the 
ever-growing social network. When I first heard about 
Facebook four years ago, I promised myself I would never 
sign my deal with the devil and get an account. Four years later and here I am, one of those people who logs on at least 
twice a day to update myself on things that the website says 
I care about.
After trying to quit numerous times, which only resulted 
in broken promises to myself and my support group, I have begun to realize that my profile on the site has become part of 
my own personality, for better or worse. Millions of people 
around the world can relate to the good and bad of having a Facebook account. 
Beyond simply having to weigh keeping in touch with 
friends against any social overload you may face, many Fa-
cebook users are now facing a greater decision on whether 
to keep their account in face of the latest controversy over Facebook’s privacy policy.
Essentially, Facebook, the world’s largest social network-
ing site with more than 400 million users, has been cutting 
back on its promises to keep the personal information of its 
users private. Recently, the site has opened up its users’ pri-vate information to marketers and announced a new system through which “partner” websites will have access to user 
profiles.
Any regular Facebook devotee can attest to the hundreds 
of advertisements that pop up in the margins and know a 
little too much about your musical tastes and personal eating 
habits.  While it is possible for any regular user to opt out of 
having his or her information exposed, the website’s privacy policy is about 5,800 words and a harder read than James Joyce. As a result, many people like me are stuck without the time or the patience in order to keep our personal informa-
tion truly secure.However, these latest actions by 
Facebook have many Internet users and bloggers up in arms and pushing 
for an all-out boycott of the website. May 31 was even declared by many as “Quit Facebook Day” (although no 
Facebook event was created for it).
While the website has obviously 
stepped over the line in sharing user 
information with marketers and other websites in the name 
of a new sharing service, it remains to be seen whether these 
latest transgressions will result in true change in terms of Fa-
cebook’s privacy policy and other issues. I actually thought this uproar would’ve come when FarmVille and Mafia Wars 
started to become popular and ruined the lives of users ev-
erywhere.
While this latest privacy issue is incredibly important, any 
actions taken by the online community to combat Facebook’s 
power will be thwarted by two things. The first is general ap-
athy or ignorance by the majority of Facebook users to these 
changes and what effect they will have. Many users, myself 
included, log on every day and pay little attention to the pri-
vacy policy of the site unless we are blocked from someone’s profile and photo albums.
In addition to this, Facebook has smartly sided with its 
advertisers and sponsors by opening up the information of its users to the public market. It is a system that has worked for them so far and allows the website to truly bridge the gap between reality and the Internet.
However, Facebook should be concerned about the fickle-
ness of the average Internet user. With too many more trans-gressions, the social networking powerhouse may go the way of MSN Messenger, MySpace and tens of other failed social networking engines. Where will I update my status then?

Donating hair to oil spill effort wasn’t 
done in vain.
I cut off 8 inches or so and donated all 
my hair to the group in the plaza Thurs-
day.
Do I regret it if BP is not accepting hair 
right now? Certainly not. 
Even if my giant tuft of hair is sitting 
in some lady’s house right now, the possi-
bility that maybe sometime in the future it 
could be used in the cleanup effort is good enough for me. 
And the fact that it feels about ten de-
grees cooler outside now is pretty nice 
too.

UF Supreme Court nominees lacked 
basic knowledge about FERPA.David Nigliazzo was not the only con-
troversial nominee. 
Tony Bajoczky, Jr. apparently did not 
know what the Family Educational Rights 
and Privacy Act is.
Senate Minority Leader Jon Ossip asked 
for Bajoczky’s view on how FERPA applies 
to student government (the court has pre-
viously ruled that the senators’ voting re-cords are protected by FERPA) and his re-sponse was basically that the UF Supreme Court is bound by state law (FERPA is a 
federal law). 
Bajozcky passed on a strict party line 
vote, with all and only the Unite Party 
senators voting yes.

Officers’ claims of self-defense do not 
justify student shooting.Bill Cervone’s statement clearly indi-
cates that he believes police officers can, in 
the name of self-defense, shoot any person 
in their presence armed with a possibly 
deadly weapon — such as a cane, which is hardly different from a table leg — and wielding it in a dangerous manner. 
This is unbelievable. Using such logic, 
one could shoot an ornery elderly person shaking his cane at kids on bicycles. 
It would be nice to assume that we 
would hold police officers to a higher stan-
dard than this. 
The vast majority of police officers are 
selfless, honorable people with a strong 
intention of protecting others and promot-
ing justice. 
However, what happened here was 
clearly more than just a tragic accident. 
Fault ought to lay with one party, and 
it is fairly clear that Officer Smith crossed several legal and ethical lines. 
Andrew Lapetina
Grad student, UF ‘12 Bus customer does not deserve refund 
for his missed flight.
This headline, “Bus customer demands  
refund for missed flight,” makes it sound like 
the bus didn’t get him there on time, in which case he would be right to demand a refund. 
But HE canceled his flight because he felt 
sick, which may or may not have had any-thing to do with the flight. 
Sorry, but this guy sounds like a miserable 
person trying to get sympathy for a situation that really shouldn’t have been that big of a deal.

Fat Tuscan restaurant owners can’t 
complain about zoning restrictions.
If the zoning code hasn’t changed, then the 
owners of the Fat Tuscan have no argument. 
Breaking a law isn’t defacto justification to 
for continuing to do so.
Robert Hueckstaedt
online commentator
It is love at first sight. It is a Thursday afternoon, and 
you are exhausted, waiting on the bus and eager to 
get home. 
Unexpectedly, an angel comes and sits right next to 
you. In your head, she’s the most beautiful creature you’ve 
ever seen. You’ve used every other adjective to describe 
her, yet nothing quite hits the spot. You glance over twice 
just to confirm she is the reason behind your severe short-
age of words. Angelic, insanely attractive, busty, the list goes on. 
You try it all, yet no descriptive word can actually do 
justice to that woman’s beauty. Somehow, a deep breath with  a simple “Holy Phallus Jesus” does the trick.
You clear your throat a couple of times, wipe your 
hands on your pants and introduce yourself to her. 
“Hi there,” you say to her. “My name is Mr. X, blah 
blah blah.” 
You ask her about her major and her classes in the 
hopes of finding something that would link you with her. 
Here comes the bus. You’ve got to part ways with her. You lie beautifully to her, and she agrees to give you her number. 
Well, she would never pick up 
anyway. You will never see that 
woman again. Or maybe you will. 
But one thing is for sure: you 
wanted that woman and probably still want her. There is 
that woman and your reality.
That  woman is UF, and the reality? Yeah, it is you  be-
ing a soccer fan. 
Being a soccer fan at UF is like falling for somebody 
you will never have. Don’t get me wrong, I love watching football and basketball, and I am a proud Gator. 
But what kills me is the fact that Tim Tebow wouldn’t 
be the person he is today had his talent been soccer. UF doesn’t even have a male soccer team.  
We need engineers, doctors and football players as 
well as soccer players. 
If we expect America to win a World Cup, we must 
also realize that soccer talents also deserve to get some shine right here at home.  
Not everyone is meant to be President Obama; America needs its Cristiano Ronaldo or David Beckham, too. 
 We teach our children that anything is possible, but 
we sometimes fail to give them the possibilities to do any-
thing. 
Soccer is by far the most beautiful game. Think about 
it. You use hands in every other sport except soccer.  
Do you ever try to hold a fork with your foot? Well, 
that’s what soccer is all about. 
It makes the unimaginable look simple, even boring 
at times. Do we want our children and grandchildren to 
miss out on the possibility of doing something great in their lives just because they happen to be American or at-
tending an American college?  
Of course, all that theory is relative. But relativity is 
such a crazy concept. Again, that’s relative.
 One thing is for sure: Being enrolled at the Univer-
sity of Florida, or any American college, should never put 
one’s passion for the most popular sport in the world in jeopardy.

� NCAA OUTDOOR CHAMPIONSHIPS 
BEGIN JUNE 9 IN EUGENE, ORE.
  By JESSE SIMONTON
 Alligator Writer
   
 While Willy Wonka’s Golden Tickets 
may have been hard to come by, the Gators 
track and ﬁ  eld teams collected their tickets 
to the NCAA Outdoor Championships as easy as stealing candy from a baby.
The Gators enjoyed a successful week-
end in Greensboro, N.C., at the NCAA 
Preliminary Round, advancing 16 athletes 
and qualifying for 21 spots. 
The Gators will head to Eugene, Ore., 
with a strong contingent on a mission 
to bring more championships back to 
Gainesville.
“We talked before we got here about 
doing our job at this meet and getting as many of our scorers through to the NCAA 
meet as possible,” UF coach Mike Hollo-
way said. “I thought we did a great job this weekend.”
The NCAA Outdoor Championships 
take place June 9-12 and all of the Gators’ top athletes will have a chance to win a 
title.
The No. 1 ranked men’s team had nine 
Gators qualify for seven events. 
Christian Taylor, the Southeastern Con-
ference Field Athlete of the Year, contin-
ued his ﬁ  eld dominance and advanced in both the long jump and triple jump. Team-mate Omar Craddock also qualiﬁ  ed in the triple jump.
Four of the fastest men’s sprinters in 
the country – Jeff Demps, Terrell Wilks, Calvin Smith and Tony McQuay – all ad-
vanced to Eugene.
Demps advanced in the 100-meter 
dash, Wilks qualiﬁ  ed for both the 100- and 
200-meter dash while Smith and McQuay 
will each represent Florida in the 400-me-
ter dash.
Both of Florida’s top-ranked relay teams 
also advanced to the championships.“A lot of times when you come in as the 
favorite, or you are expected to do certain 
things, you have a tendency to get compla-cent,” Holloway said. “I thought everybody did a wonderful job and that was a byprod-uct of our focus.”
The defending NCAA Champion 4x100-
meter relay team, anchored by Demps, 
notched the top qualifying time with a sea-son-best time of 38.81. The 4x400-meter re-lay team, which entered the meet with the 
fastest time in the world so 
far this season, also clinched 
a spot in the ﬁ  nals.
The men’s team also saw 
its leading shot putter, Kemal 
Mesic, and decathlete Gray 
Horn qualify for the ﬁ  nals. 
The one surprise on the men’s side was 
freshman Josh Izewski, who entered the East Preliminaries as the 48th and ﬁ  nal 
qualiﬁ  er, but he placed 12th in the men’s 
10,000-meter run to claim the ﬁ  nal spot that advanced to Eugene.
The No. 6 ranked women’s team also had an excellent meet. 
It had seven athletes qualify for six 
events. 
Shot putters Mariam Kevkhishvili, Kee-
ly Medeiros and Fidela James all punched their tickets to Eugene. 
Charlotte Browning, the top women’s 
1,500-meter runner in the SEC, advanced to Eugene while Julie Northrup, the sec-ond-fastest women’s steeplechase athlete in school history, also qualiﬁ  ed for the ﬁ  -
nals.
The East Preliminaries top women’s jav-
elin thrower, Evelien Dekkers, advanced 
to the championships by placing ﬁ  rst in her event.
The SEC’s top women’s ﬁ  eld athlete 
Shara Proctor matched her Gators men’s counterpart, Taylor, also advancing to Eu-gene in the long jump and triple jump.  
“The things we want to do in two 
weeks started Thursday,” Holloway said. “If we hadn’t done our jobs this weekend, we wouldn’t be able to score points in two weeks.” Gators send 16 to NCAA Outdoor Championships

UF junior Kelsey Bruder hit two home runs to lead the Gators past Arizona State on Sunday. She has racked up four homers and 10 RBIs in five NCAA Tournament games this season.
Go ahead and add another na-

You might not know it, because

Ultimate Frisbee is a niche sport 
– many college students are familiar with it, but not many sports fans fol-low it.
It doesn’t receive the glamorous at-
tention of football or basketball. And it’s certainly not even on the same level as soccer – a sport that struggles to catch on with mainstream America – but ultimate combines elements of all of those sports and it requires just as much skill, endurance and hand-eye coordination.
As a result, ultimate has its own unique fol-lowing.

It appears that juniors Kelsey Bruder and Stephanie Brom-
bacher have developed a formula for winning in the NCAA 
Tournament. 
For the fourth time in the last five games, Bruder got the first 
RBIs and Brombacher made them count as No. 4 Florida (48-8) 
defeated No. 13 Arizona State (44-17) 5-2 on Sunday to advance 
to its third consecutive Women’s College World Series. 
“To get to the (WCWS) once is a really good team, to get there 
again is a little better team, and to make it a third time you start to build a program,” coach Tim Walton said. “I think we’ve es-tablished that we have a good foundation here and we’ve got a great program.”
Bruder once again propelled the Gators’ offense, this time 
putting UF on the board with a two-run home run in the third 
before adding a solo shot in the fifth to stretch the lead to four. 
The right fielder is now 10 for 15 with four home runs and 10 
RBIs in the team’s five NCAA Tournament games this season.
“I can’t say I’m doing anything different than I have been all 
season,” Bruder said. “It’s just clicking for me right now.”
Bruder’s run production has been immensely helpful to the 
team due not only to its magnitude, but also its timeliness. 
Six of Bruder’s 10 RBIs have represented the first runs of a 
game, as she has been responsible for opening the scoring with an extra-base hit four times in the last five matchups. 
“I’ve said this time and time again it’s easier to pitch when 
you have a lead,” Bruder said. “If we can jump on them early it 
just makes Stephanie (Brombacher)’s job easier.”
Whether it’s due to pitching from ahead or  being in a groove, 
Brombacher has been making it look easy the last two weeks.

Despite not winning their conference tour-
nament, the Gators received some good news 
Monday.
No. 4 Florida (42-15) received the No. 3 
overall seed in the NCAA Tournament and 
will host Florida Atlantic (35-22), Oregon 
State (31-22) and Bethune-Cookman (35-20) 
in the Gainesville Regional this weekend.
“We kind of figured we would be one of 
the eight (seeds), and I think that was our goal 
in the beginning of the season so we can host 
regionals and super regionals,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. 
UF will begin play Friday at 7 p.m. against 
Bethune-Cookman in McKethan Stadium.
The Gators hope they fare a little better in 
the regional than they did in the Southeastern Conference Tournament, in which they were eliminated by Alabama (37-21) Saturday.
Despite conference officials’ decision to shorten each of the day’s games to seven in-nings because of weather and time logistics concerns, it felt like the game still wasn’t short enough for UF, which likely had a national seed locked up before the tourney.
The Gators, which had been on the road 
for 11 days, fell 5-2 to crowd-favorite Alabama 
in the shortened game, eliminating them from the 
double-elimination tourna-
ment.
Alabama pitcher Adam 
Morgan thrived off UF’s 
inpatient approach at the 
plate. He benefited from six 
first-pitch outs and 12 fly 
ball outs.
After giving up six runs in his first appear-
ance against Florida on May 7, the left-hander lasted the full seven innings Saturday and only allowed two runs.
“He pitched up and down in the zone UF to host NCAA Regional

Brombacher gives up one earned run in fifth straight complete game
super regional finale, allowing seven hits in 
her fifth consecutive complete game.
Through her five NCAA Tournament 
starts Brombacher has amassed an ERA of just .90 and has struck out 33 batters compared to 
just five walks. 
The only time Brombacher seemed to be 
tested was in the seventh inning of Game 2, 
when the Sun Devils loaded the bases and got as close as 5-2 before Brombacher ended the inning and the series. 
“We didn’t get to see that (Arizona State) 
offense like it was in the last inning,” coach 
Tim Walton said. “That is what the offense is 
all about, they string hits together like they’ve done all year long. I think we stepped up and that just shows how good Stephanie was pitch-ing all along.”
With the win, the Gators officially punched 
their ticket to the WCWS in Oklahoma City for the third straight season.
The team will face No. 5 UCLA (45-11) at 3:30 p.m. on Thursday before taking on either 
No. 16 Hawaii (49-14) or No. 9 Missouri (51-11) in 
Game 2.
“It’s so much fun to play 
in front of everybody and 
play for our school,” said ju-nior Megan Bush, who also 
contributed a home run in Sunday’s win. “It’s really fun to get back out there, so 
I’m really exited.”Although Bush, Bruder and Brombacher 
have all been to the WCWS twice before, each acknowledged that the feeling is different in 
a year when many expected the team would 
struggle. 
“I said it before, Stacey Nel-
son is irreplaceable,” Bruder said.  
“She’s a phenomenal pitcher but the offense has stepped up, as has our pitching staff. A lot of people didn’t think we’d get back here but its great to prove them wrong.”

casions in a back-and-forth game 
that saw three ties and a second-half rally from Carleton to knot the score at 9-9 after trailing 9-6 early in the second half.
After a score by Carleton that 
would have given it its first lead of the game at 10-9 was called back on a travel, Florida took over again, scoring three consecutive times, and wouldn’t look back. 
Led by ten assists from Smith 
and six scores from Cole Sullivan, Florida took home its second na-
tional title – the first was in 2006 – 
and celebrated on the field in front of a very pro-Carleton crowd that booed UF on several occasions.
Florida, which one of the an-nouncers remarked “doesn’t have the best reputation in the ultimate community,” played the role of villain and spoiled Carleton’s bid at back-to-back titles.
It was a fitting championship, 
really.
The Ultimate Players Associa-
tion just recently rebranded itself as USA Ultimate to make the sport more marketable to prospective fans – complete with CBS College Sports Network coverage and a live webcast of the championship game.
And really, what in sports is 
more marketable, aside from may-
be an underdog story, than having 
the good guys take on the bad guys on the sport’s biggest stage?
So while UF will bask in the 
glory of taking home its second national title, and rightfully so, USA Ultimate also won on Mon-day with its attempt at making the sport more mainstream. 
Now maybe the next time Flor-
ida adds a USA Ultimate College 
Championship to its trophy case, 
more people will be aware of it, and while unlikely, we might just see some students rush University Avenue in celebration.

UF pitcher Tommy Toledo lasted just 3.2 innings while surrendering five runs in only 
his second start since returning from injury.
Toledo allows five to score in SEC Tournament loss to Crimson Tide
and mixed his pitches well,” senior Matt den 
Dekker said. “We didn’t adjust and hit a lot of fly ball outs and gave him too many easy 
outs.”
But UF pitcher Tommy Toledo didn’t help 
his own cause against the Crimson Tide. 
The redshirt sophomore threw a pickoff 
attempt over first baseman Preston Tucker’s 
head in the first, allowing Alabama’s Josh Rutledge to advance from first to third. The shortstop later scored an unearned run off a sacrifice fly to give his team the early 1-0 lead.
Toledo, who made just his fourth appear-
ance Saturday since returning from injury, continued to struggle from there until he was pulled in the fourth after pitching UF into a 
5-0 deficit. He conceded five runs and allowed 
eight base runners in 3.2 innings of work.
“I don’t think he got hit awfully hard,” 
O’Sullivan said. “There were a couple of things that occurred during the game that 
happened because he hasn’t been out there in 
a while, but I’m encouraged with the way he threw the ball.”
The five-run deficit was too much for Flor-
ida to overcome, despite an encouraging per-formance from the bullpen.
The most impressive outing came from 
reliever Nick Maronde who had given up six earned runs in his last 2.2 innings before Satur-
day, when he struck out the side in the fifth.
The Gators even made some light of the 
left-hander’s control issues with a sarcastic ap-
plause from the dugout after Maronde threw seven straight strikes.
“We’ve been working awfully hard with 
(Maronde),” O’Sullivan. “He’s very talented and it’s not unusual that a good player goes through some tough times. That’s a huge, huge 
positive for us going into next weekend.”
The bullpen’s performance kept the game 
within striking distance, but UF’s offense 
could not figure out Morgan.BASEBALL , from page 15
