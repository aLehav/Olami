After a marked absence from a May meeting to 
address the closure of Shands at AGH, Shands CEO 
Timothy Goldfarb addressed concerns about the fu-ture of community health care at a special Wednesday meeting.  
The meeting, which brought together both city and 
county commissions, showcased plans from Gold-
farb for handling patient and employee overflow, as well as the future of the downtown hospital’s property.
Goldfarb, who oversaw the closing, 
said Shands at UF will be equipped to 
take on extra patients when it opens a new emergency department and Shands Cancer Center on Nov. 1.
Goldfarb said none of programs or employees from 
Shands’ AGH programs or employees would be cut by the closing, adding that only 52 of the 1150 AGH employees have not yet been placed. 
Still, Goldfarb was unsure what presence AGH’s 
programs for heart rehabilitation and wound-care would have at Shands at UF, but there would likely be

UF President Bernie Machen’s proposed 
changes to the festivities surrounding the 
UF-Georgia football game in Jacksonville — including a ban on the sale of liquor shots — are getting some heat from Student Gov-
ernment, including Student Body President 
Jordan Johnson.
Johnson said he thinks Machen’s ideals 
are sound but thinks the proposed changes would actually make the experience more dangerous for students.
In addition to banning shots, Machen 
and Vice President for Student Affairs Pa-tricia Telles-Irvin asked Jacksonville Mayor 
John Peyton in a June letter to halve the 
number of temporary alcohol vendors, limit occupancy at The Jacksonville Landing — a popular strip of shops and restaurants in downtown Jacksonville — and crack down on alcohol laws, all on the city’s dime.
The requests came before a meeting that 
discussed UF and Jacksonville’s contract, which ends after the 2010 game.
By attempting to limit the amount of 
alcohol at the Landing, Johnson said, it encour-ages students to drink in less safe places.
He said he’d rather 
see students drink at the Landing, which is sur-
rounded by safe zones instead of in hotel rooms 
and tailgate parties.
Booze is also more expensive, and lines 
are longer, at the Landing, which provide 
disincentives for overconsumption, he said.
He said he doesn’t think Machen should 
be trying to regulate the drinking habits of SG opposes liquor banSEE A gH, p AgE 12

UF announced Tuesday it will receive 
a five-year, $26 million grant from the Na-
tional Institutes of Health to cut the time 
it takes for scientific breakthroughs to be-
come incorporated into medical practices.
The money will fund research, the 
translation of scientific discoveries into medical applications and the marketing of those applications.
UF has received larger grants in the 
past, but the prestige is what makes this grant significant, said Win Phillips, UF’s vice president for research. 
“The important thing is the acknowl-
edgement that UF is one of the top health research centers in the nation,” Phillips said.
“It’s clearly one of the most important 
events in the history of the University of Florida.”
UF is the only university in Florida to 
get the grant. It will be one of 60 institu-tions to have won when the grants are given out by 2012.
The grant encompasses 12 of UF’s 16 
colleges, as well as the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences and its exten-
sion offices across the state, the Shands UF gets $26M grant

Transparency bill fails in senate
A Sunshine in the Swamp bill 
calling for more transparency in Stu-
dent Senate failed 15 to 53. 
The bill would have required  
training for senators, and there was no conversation with officers to see if they were willing to comply, said Senate President Audrey Goldman. 
The meeting mainly focused on 
a resolution proposed by President Bernie Machen concerning liquor laws in Jacksonville for the UF-Geor-gia game that would limit the types of liquor sold, Sen. Alan Yanuck said. Goldman said senators will send a resolution to Tigert Hall by next week. From there, students can react, she said.
“I mean, we can get the whole 
football team if you want to,” line-backer and Sen. Brandon Hicks said.

performing Arts College 
holds wine and cake benefit
A Spanish red blend wine and 
a nine-generation chocolate butter rum cake will set the mood for the first Summer Wine Festival fund-raiser. 
On Sunday at the Phillips Cen-
ter for the Performing Arts, UF will host a fundraiser to benefit the Phillips Center, Baughman Center and the University Auditorium, according to UF’s Performing Arts development coordinator Lori Sie-gel.
The festival will showcase 16 
wine and chocolate vendors who specialize in creations like Italian chocolate and cakes from chocolate butter rum to red velvet. About 10 amateur bakers will also donate cakes to the silent auction, where a total of 20 cakes will be sold. Sie-gel said the event was designed to be a fun and unique way to raise 
money.
“Ideally if we could raise $5,000 
to $10,000, that would be great, but 
we know this is a new thing, and we won’t make as much as we hope,” Siegel said, adding that she expects 75 to 100 people to attend.
Judy Blachly, co-chairwoman of 
the fundraising committee for the 
performing arts, said she loves the 
excitement of talking to vendors about what they plan to bring. 
“I’m a chocoholic,” she said.Blachly said she feels there isn’t 
a lot going on in the summer and wants to keep people engaged in the performing arts. 
“The event also allows local 
businesses to showcase a variety of wine, food and desserts, which can be great exposure,” she said.
Magdalen Reiter, owner of the 
mail-order, old-fashioned liquor cake company Butterfly Limited, said she will feature her butter rum chocolate cake, a recipe of which has been passed down through 
generations.“It’s a family heirloom,” she 
said. 
The event will be held in the 
Phillip Center’s two foyers and lobby from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Tick-
ets are $50 in advance and $60 at the door. Attendees must be 21 years old. For more information or to purchase tickets call 352- 846-3647.

gala to fundraise for triple 
negative breast cancer
Mary Lou Miller wanted to 
help her daughter  through cer-
vical cancer. 
But Michelle Gumz, Miller’s 
daughter and an employee at UF’s College of Medicine, never 
thought she’d have to return the 
favor.
Miller died in September after 
an eight-month battle with triple 
negative breast cancer, labeled 
TNBC, a particularly painful and 
aggressive form of the illness. 
In honor of Miller, the Col-
laboration of Scientists for Criti-
cal Research in Biomedicine will 
hold a gala, “Set Sail for Discov-
ery,” Saturday to raise awareness 
and funding for TNBC.
Collaboration’s President Lisa 
Stow, who works with Gumz in 
the College of Medicine, and col-
leagues Susan Salganik and Sara Palmer began the research orga-
nization after Miller’s death. The 
money raised at the gala will go toward a seed grant for research 
on TNBC at UF. 
Fifteen percent of breast can-
cer patients are triple negative 
patients, and 25 percent of the women who die from breast can-
cer have TNBC.  TNBC is a form 
of the breast cancer that lacks the three common receptors (estro-gen, progesterone and HER2, or 
human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2) found in breast can-cer tumors, which chemotherapy 
targets to get rid of the cancer, 
Stow said. 
Without these three receptors, 
the chemotherapy has no target and no way to kill the tumor, she explained. After living with the 
knowledge of her cancer for about 
a month, Gumz said, her mother 
found out her cancer spread to her 
brain, like it does in almost 40 per-
cent of TNBC cases. She died six 
weeks later. 
“I told her not to worry,” Gumz 
said. “‘It’ll all be fine,’ I kept re-peating.”
Gumz said oncologists told her 
it wouldn’t have mattered if they 
found the cancer earlier; she would 
have died anyway. But Gumz was 
skeptical.
“The earlier you find it, the lon-
ger life you have,” Gumz said.  
Stow said there is little known 
about effective treatment for the 
TNBC tumors. But the Collabora-
tion hopes to change that by rais-
ing enough funds at the gala to do research at UF.  
“[TNBC] probably has some-
thing they can target,” Gumz said referring to chemotherapy treat-
ments. “They just don’t know 
what it is yet.”
The nautical-themed gala will 
feature a string quartet, a ballet 
performance by Dance Alive, a 
silent auction and a keynote ad-
dress by Dr. Edith Perez, a cancer 
researcher for TNBC. 
“If they had found one lesion, 
they could’ve done something,” Gumz said. “It’s so important to raise awareness. Maybe we could 
have had a few more months. 
Maybe she could’ve held her 
grandchildren longer.”
The gala will be held at the Can-
cer and Genetic Research Complex at 7 p.m. Saturday. Tickets are $50 
for students and $125 for general 
admission. For more information,

Gainesville is the fifth meanest 
city in the nation toward the home-
less for the second time in a row, according to a recent report.
Los Angeles ranked No. 1 in 
the report released Tuesday by the National Coalition for the Home-less and the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty. The list was last compiled in 2004.
Criteria for the list included the 
number of anti-homeless laws in the city, the enforcement of those laws, the general political climate toward homeless people in the city and the city’s history of criminal-ization measures, according to the National Coalition for the Home-less’ Web site.
“We’ve been tracking what 
has been going on in Gainesville for years,” said Michael Stoops, executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless.
Gainesville was cited as hav-
ing insensitive panhandling and public spaces laws, limiting the amount of food a religious group can give the homeless and forcing people off of campsites without providing them with an alterna-tive place to go, Stoops said, refer-ring to the 2007 and 2009 Tent City evictions.
“They [the Gainesville Police 
Department] have sweeps to cut you off from the food in hopes that you move along to another city or go live in the woods like stray animals,” Stoops said. “Hopefully this rank will start some new de-bate and bring people together and figure out what can be done.”
Jayne Moraski, director of 
the Office on Homelessness for Gainesville and Alachua County, agrees. 
“It is important to use this as an 
opportunity to remind ourselves of the commitment we made to end homelessness,” she said.
According to Moraski, the city 
is waiting to receive federal money from the Homeless Prevention and Rapid Re-housing Program. 
After funding is secured, mon-
ey will be used to provide case management services for homeless individuals and make it easier for them to access services they need, such as health services and coun-
seling, Moraski said.

Mediums offering messages from lost loved ones, acupunc-
ture physicians touting instant acupressure facelifts and licensed 
therapists administering shoulder massages will all be available under one roof this Saturday.  
The Spiritual Connections Psychic Faire will be held at the 
Unitarian Universalist Fellowship, located at 4225 NW 34th St., from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. The fair is appropriate for all ages and ad-mission costs $3. Most of the services provided on-site cost about $20. 
Marguerite Romeis, who has been a psychic reader for 28 years 
and teaches classes at Santa Fe College, has organized the fair in Gainesville three times a year for the past 14 years, she said. 
“I just got tired of people thinking we were a bunch of kooks,” 
Romeis said.
There will be vendors selling food and items such as candles 
and Indian clothing.
Additionally, about 50 booths will feature specialties that in-
clude healing, massage, psychic reading and acupressure, the event coordinator said. 
Louise Link, a medium clairvoyant, said she receives mes-
sages using senses beyond the standard five.
She will conduct 15-minute psychic readings at the fair for $20 
each. However, fair-goers won’t find out from Link the upcom-ing lotto numbers or how long they have to live.
 “I don’t predict the future,” she said, “because I don’t believe 
we can.” Psychic fair to

Citing privacy rules, UF officials 
aren’t revealing what possible con-
sequences a student fired for plagia-rizing The New York Times during a reporting internship will face.
Third-year journalism student 
Hailey Mac Arthur, who was fired last week from a summer internship with The Colorado Springs Gazette, met Wednesday morning with offi-cials from the College of Journalism and Communications to discuss her 
academic future.
The Gazette determined Mac Ar-thur had plagiarized The New York 
Times in four of 
her stories.
“I really can’t 
say anything oth-
er than the matter is being resolved,” said William McKeen, chair of the Department of Journalism.
McKeen, along with journalism 
master lecturer Mike Foley, attend-ed the meeting with Mac Arthur.
John Wright, dean of the college, 
said he won’t be able to discuss the case but said the college would han-dle the situation.
“We’ll follow university policy 
and do whatever is appropriate,” Wright said.
Mac Arthur could not be reached 
for comment by e-mail.

Today’s question: Is Gainesville mean to the homeless?The results of Tuesday’s question are unavailable due to a technical error.
Bill of Health
Best health care reform 
strategy is unclear
Johnson questions Machen’s meddlingThe wide-sweeping health insurance reform that Presi-
dent Barack Obama has promised is finally on its way 
to being delivered, and the Editorial Board is not sure 
how to feel about it. 
The proposed bill, which has just passed the Senate 
Health Committee (the first of six stages in its ascent to the 
Senate floor), calls for mandatory health insurance for all 
Americans and a government-run insurance program that 
will compete with private programs. 
Sounds great. Then again, most things on QVC; those 
CutCo knives that everyone you went to high school with tries to sell to your parents as soon as you leave for college and Billy Mays’ Awesome Auger (too soon?) always sound-ed great until we found out they cost like, 90 payments of $9.97 (Nickelodeon magazine, please!). Over the course of the next 10 years, the program would cost about a trillion dollars to implement. To us, and to everyone really, that cost is a little abstract. To write a million dots on sheets of paper would leave you with a room entirely full of paper. To do 
that with a trillion dots, you would fill up every room in 
Turlington. 
Opponents of the bill will surely be quick to cry “social-
ized medicine” and to call, “There will be waiting lines!” 
with a Daniel Plainview level of fervor. These are not the 
problems that the Editorial Board is concerned about. Medi-cine in America is already rationed on very clear terms: People with money get a ration, people without money can’t afford one.
Democrats are calling it an investment; Republicans are 
calling it an inappropriate expenditure. The bottom line is that neither party can predict how this will pan out.  The Ed-itorial Board does not claim to be more knowledgable than the senators who will either approve or deny the bill, and our psychic powers lie just below those of Miss Cleo and just above those of the mighty Alakazam (whose IQ is claimed to 
be 10,000, despite the fact that it can’t escape a pokéball). 
Obama is channeling Maynard Keynes with the assump-
tion that stimulating the economy through an investment in 
infrastructure will pay off in the long run, and Republicans are complaining that we simply don’t have the money to invest. Spending money inside the country as opposed to spending it in Iraq seems reasonable (but don’t sue us, we aren’t economics majors, and I think the median age that the Editorial Board stopped taking math at is around 15.3). But, note the word “assumption.” This spending approach has 
not been tested. This is not FDR Redux. In fact this, could 
possibly be closer to “Apocalypse Now: Redux.” There is no 
World War II waiting in the wings to give us the extra push. 
The potential horror, the potential horror.
Apart from the bill’s possiblity of backfire, we recognize 
the need for health care reform. There are about 46 million Americans without health insurance. Medical care makes up about a fifth of our country’s GDP. The majority of Ameri-cans say we need major health care reform this year, accord-
ing to a Gallup poll. Basically, things are crazy. So while 
the Editorial Board is not ready to give a thumbs-up or a thumbs-down to the 1000-page bill (and is certainly inca-pable of reading it, considering one of us has been reading “Ulysses” for three years), we laud Obama for at least mak-ing good on his word. We just hope that we don’t have to be careful what we wished for.This fall many UF students will take the hour-and-a-
half trek up to Jacksonville for the yearly tradition of the UF-Georgia football game. But if President 
Machen has his way, students will find a very different 
situation awaiting them in Jacksonville. 
In a letter to Mayor Peyton of Jacksonville, President 
Machen and Vice President of Student Affairs Patricia 
Telles-Irvin expressed their concern about the safety of UF students in locations like the Landing. In the letter, 
the two administrators laid out plans they believe will 
keep students safe if implemented. Included are changes like the prohibition of shots at the Landing, a 50 percent decrease in temporary alcohol distribution points and a 
shifting of the total cost of the Sideline Safety Zones to the 
City of Jacksonville.
It has already been reported in the press that the con-
tract UF has with the City of Jacksonville is up for renewal after next year and that the city’s compliance with these 
demands will determine the likelihood that the game will 
continue to be hosted in Jacksonville. 
My feeling on this issue is that President Machen has 
his heart in the right place and is doing his job by trying 
to protect the students, but I believe that there is more to 
the solution. I do not feel that limiting the availability of alcohol at the Landing will truly solve the problems that 
have presented themselves in the last few years. We need 
to provide education and awareness to the student body instead of making decisions for them. 
President Machen devoted an entire section of his let-
ter to the success of the popular and efficient Sideline 
Safety Program. I believe that an increase in safety pre-
cautions like these are necessary to help protect students. With this in mind and with an understanding of the uni-versity’s difficult economic situ-ation, I think that it makes sense to ask for more support from the City of Jacksonville to fund these 
life saving programs. 
Programs like the Sideline 
Safety Program in combination 
with education campaigns on the dangers of excessive drinking and 
awareness efforts to help students 
understand their limits will be more effective than mak-
ing purchasing decisions for students. I hesitate to sup-port policies that would decentralize drinking into areas 
of Jacksonville that do not have the same safety measures 
provided in areas like the Landing. 
To truly provide a safe UF-Georgia weekend, the uni-
versity must work towards providing a safe alternative to the Landing. That’s why I have been working with Presi-
dent Machen to plan a concert the night before the game 
and an official tailgate outside of the stadium on Game day. By giving students options that don’t simply involve drinking at the Landing, we decrease the risks involved 
of everyone being in one place. We also improve the abil-
ity to provide assistance to individuals by ensuring that safety zones are present at all of these activities. 
While the ‘World’s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party’ 
may be slightly different this year, I think we can make sure it will be even more entertaining for all of the stu-dents while still preserving the safety of everyone in-volved and the longstanding tradition of the UF- Georgia 
game.

Letters to the Editor
Columnist ignored Obama critics
Soon-to-be-former Gov. Sarah Pa-
lin has been kicked around merciless-
ly by those who oppose her political 
views. Everything from her family 
to her wardrobe has been endlessly criticized.
When Eric Chianese started to 
write a column for last week’s paper, maybe he had to pick from a wither-ing amount of favorable topics for an Obama supporter. 
Should he write on the national 
deficit that recently reached the stag-gering amount of $1 trillion? Or may-be try to understand how the federal government is trying to fix health care by throwing more money into a burning pit? Neither of these topics, 
I guess, were so flattering to the cur-
rent president.
So Chianese resorted to what most 
left-leaning writers are best at: sling-ing mud at their favorite target, Gov. 
Palin.  
Why do they attack her? Perhaps 
they are scared that a woman is sup-
porting and pushing a conservative 
agenda. They can’t possibly under-
stand why she would, so instead of trying to understand her, they simply attack without any remorse and with growing ferocity.
Palin’s critics were no doubt pray-ing for a cheating scandal like Gov. Mark Sanford’s. But nothing has real-
ly come up since her announcement.
Instead of just relying on what 
Gov. Palin said, everyone, especially 
Chianese, is still clinging to the hope that it is, in fact, a scandal without 
leaving room for any other possibil-
ity.
Chianese was right about one 
thing, America does need to laugh, 
and that is because of the deepen-
ing deficit and reckless spending in Washington, D.C.

Tuesday’s  editorial  regarding  Supreme  
Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor was 
filled with much of the same “empathy” 
we expect Sotomayor to rule with, but little fact. 
It is of note that you didn’t provide the 
context of the “wise Latina” quote (in which she stated her opinion that a “wise Latina” would come to better conclusions than a white male).
Had a conservative nominee stated that a 
“wise white male” would come to better con-clusions than a Latina, I doubt you would treat it with the same disregard.
You state that the job of a Supreme Court justice is to apply the law, not make it. I agree.
Unfortunately, Sotomayor believes (and has 
publicly stated) that the federal appeals courts — her courts — are where policy is made.  This statement has been a focal point of the debate. Its absence in your evaluation seems to indicate 
frightening negligence, ignorance or bias; and  
perhaps all three. You go on to say you could 
not find evidence that Sotomayor could be clas-sified with an agenda; that she hasn’t shown blatant “sympathy” to minority groups.
Ricci v. DeStefano flies in the face of this. 
The case itself is Sotomayor doing her best to influence policy.
As for the ethics, you call it “reverse rac-ism,” but there is no 
such thing. The term 
is nothing more than a dishonest method of positing that rac-
ism against group X is somehow more accept-
able than racism against group Y, when in re-
ality all racism is wrong in principle.
You state that when Sotomayor struck 
down the appeal, she was doing so because she “firmly believes” in the Civil Rights Act 
(making it seem like her opponents don’t care 
about civil rights).
The truth is that Title VII applies to ALL 
races, including, oh my God, Caucasians.If African-Americans were denied promo-
tions because Caucasians couldn’t pass the same race-neutral test, you’d blow decades worth of DARTS before letting that die. 
Lastly, Pappas v. Giuliani had an estab-
lished precedent that Sotomayor disregarded: 
Garcetti v. Ceballos, where it established that 
the First Amendment does not apply to speech pursuant to public employment. Because Pap-pas’ situation (the solicitation reception) was enabled by his employment, he was acting in 
official capacity, and Sotomayor, regardless of 
her position’s moral high ground, was trying to make policy, not interpret it.

 She arrived in Tehran the day 
after Neda Soltani was shot dead 
in the streets, a murder that added fuel to the most heated days of re-
cent Iranian protests.
But as UF junior Neda Zaman 
landed at Imam Khomeini In-
ternational Airport in Tehran on June 21, she mostly thought about reuniting with cousins, aunts and uncles.
As video of Soltani’s death hit 
YouTube and circled the globe, 
tens of thousands protested the 
re-election of Iran’s controversial President Mahmoud Ahmadine-jad by marching and chanting in Tehran’s streets.
For Zaman, the reality of Iran 
is wider than media portrayals. Safety concerns convinced Za-man’s relatives to bypass staying 
in Tehran and take her directly 
to their home in Shahroud, about 250 miles east of Tehran. Here Za-man shopped for gold at the local bazaar, smoked hookah, enjoyed leisurely siestas and attended her aunt’s wedding, an elaborate four-day event.
Political discussions peppered 
the relaxation.
“You get different stories. A lot 
of it is word of mouth. My great aunt said there were no protests, but she has regular TV so it’s state-controlled. I talked to my friends, and they say things are still going on,” Zaman said in a Monday phone interview from Iran. She will return to Florida on 
Sunday.
While Iran’s government 
blocked Facebook and certain 
blogs, Iranians around the world, including ones in Gainesville, have been using those sites to stage Web protests.
Patricia Woods, a UF professor 
of Middle Eastern politics, said the 
grassroots movement has been ex-
hilarating for Iranian students in the United States.
“Much of the Iranian-Ameri-
can population is extremely criti-cal of the Iranian regime, much more than Americans,” she said. “I think they’re delighted that this is ﬁ  nally happening.”
Farzad Fani-Pakdel, a UF 
chemistry doctoral student who moved from Iran nine years ago, said he was inundated with chain e-mails, some mocking and slan-dering Ahmadinejad, others sup-porting him.
Iranian students at UF largely 
support opposition candidate Mir-Hossein Mousavi, Pakdel 
said. And many are embarrassed by Ah-madinejad’s anti-Isra-el comments.
Some Iranian students car-
pooled to Orlando polling stations to vote in Iran’s June 12 election.
When Ahmadinejad was de-
clared the winner, they protested on Turlington Plaza, holding signs demanding that their votes count. 
But Pakdel said he’s against 
such demonstrations in the Unit-ed States.
“We don’t want to bring the 
United States into this. It’s an in-ternal issue,” he said, referring to the widespread Iranian contempt for foreign intervention.
A self-described moderate who 
supports neither candidate, Pak-del talks often with his parents and siblings in Iran and to other 
UF students who are interested in 
Iranian politics.
 “I had to graduate, and dead-
lines were coming,” he said. “This thing took up a lot of my time.”
And while demonstrators in Tehran have gathered widespread media attention, voters outside of Tehran may have swayed the election toward Ahmadinejad, he said.
UF graduate Siavash Kouchek, 
whose father is an Iranian refu-gee and who spoke on Iran at the Civic Media Center, said that his parents were sad about the elec-tion results.
However, Kouchek is hopeful 
that the support for democracy shown in and outside of Iran is a 
sign of coming change. 
“We could be more connect-
ed to the West,” he said. “We’re 
the same. It’s been too long with us separated from the rest of the world.”

UF journalism students may 
face more than just hiring freezes 
when they graduate.
Those who aspire to become 
foreign correspondents are warned by recent high-profile capture cases that they can expect heavy 
workloads and often high danger 
levels abroad.
“It’s interesting that we have 
had a lot of students over the years who’ve said they want to be a for-eign correspondent,” said William McKeen, professor and chairman of the Department of Journalism.
“If you consider all of the hor-
rible things that have happened 
under the name of journalism in 
the last 20 years alone, it’s kind of 
depressing.”
The New York Times recently 
reported on how information 
about its now-freed journalist David Rohde was often erased or 
withheld from media outlets. Roh-
de was captured in Afghanistan by the Taliban last November and es-
caped in June, seven months later.
Information on his capture was 
concealed by The Times and Wiki-pedia in a joint effort to protect him 
from the publicity that could affect 
how his captors treated him.“It’s hard to say it was great 
because they were covering up 
community-generated news,” said 
Dave Stanton, a visiting professor 
in the College of Journalism and 
Communications.
“But clearly, in this case the 
means were noble for the secrecy to protect someone’s life.”
A graduate of the journal-
ism program at UF and former 
Baghdad bureau 
chief for USA To-
day, Rick Jervis 
knows the dan-gers of reporting far from home.
“The thing 
which ultimately 
teaches you how to excel as a for-eign correspondent is mostly just getting out there,” Jervis said. 
“There’s obviously not a whole lot 
which you can teach on a practical basis that can get you prepared.”
Each year professors and stu-
dents from UF embark on a study-abroad trip to South America, 
called the Florida FlyIns, to gain 
international exposure. 
In November 2008, the FlyIns 
program went to Guatemala for a 
week to report on malnourished 
children.  While reporting in the 
country, world news headlines told of drug violence and jail be-
headings in Guatemala, causing 
some students to question their 
safety, said Rikki Klaus, a student 
participant in the FlyIn program.
In June, the arrests in North Ko-
rea of Laura Ling and Euna Lee, two journalists reporting for Cur-
rent TV on the border of the com-
munist country, made headlines across the world.
“I think life is a dangerous 
thing,” said Mike Foley, journal-ism professor and former execu-
tive editor of the St. Petersburg 
Times. “We send some people out to cover hurricanes and storms and all sorts of things, and you just 
do it. That’s what we’re there for; 
that’s what we do.”
At UF, the College of Journalism 
and Communications has made an effort to educate its students on re-
porting in foreign countries.
Classes such as World Com-
munication Systems and Problems 
and Ethics of Journalism in Society 
offer students insight into compli-
cated situations they will face as 
international correspondents.
“You can’t ever be prepared 
for what’s out there,” said Sarah 
Henderson, a senior UF journal-
ism major. “But it’s nice to know 
that my college is looking after its 
students.”SpEcial rEpOrT

Drivers can expect traffic delays across central Gainesville 
to end no earlier than September 2011, according to a state 
official.
The resurfacing of the roadway and adjacent sidewalks 
at Northwest and Southwest 13th Street (U.S. Highway 441) that began in mid-June will move to Main Street on Sept. 1 and to University Avenue on Jan. 1.
According to Florida Department of Transportation 
spokeswoman Laurie Windham, Main Street will be per-
manently reduced from four lanes to two in the one-mile stretch between North Eighth Avenue and North 23rd Avenue, increasing 
downtown public parking.
The construction of the three areas will cost at least $13 
million, provided by state taxes and will require an estimat-
ed 8,640 hours of labor, Windham said. 
During resurfacing, asphalt on the roadway is replaced, 
and damaged sidewalk areas are repaired. While sidewalk repairs require minimal lane closures and can be worked on throughout the day, road repaving causes major delays, she said.
Nighttime paving for the 13th Street phase, which spans 
four miles from Southwest Archer Road to Northwest Sixth Avenue, will begin Aug. 1 and continue for up to three months, according to a press release by the transportation 
department.

Amateur wizards and witches donned 
Sorting Hats and Hogwarts garb Tuesday 
night as they scrambled for prime theater real estate at the opening of “Harry Potter 
and the Half-Blood Prince.”
Fans arrived as early as 10 p.m. Tuesday 
to Regal Gainesville Cinemas 14,  Southwest 
35th Boulevard, for the 12:01 a.m. showing 
of the sixth Harry Potter movie.
Helen Leung, a UF junior, excitedly 
waited in line wearing a charcoal-colored 
sweater with a Hogwarts patch stitched over the right side of her chest. 
Leung said she began preparing her cos-
tume, which also included a Gryffindor red and gold colored tie, about a month ago.
Like Leung, others modeled the tradi-
tional Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry uniform and carried wooden wands. Antonio Amorelli, a senior at UF, sprayed his hair red-orange to match the Weasley family hair color and added freck-
les to his cheeks.
“Ron’s my favorite character because 
I can relate to what he goes through,” 
Amorelli said. “My heart goes out to him 
because he constantly has to follow in his 
brothers’ footsteps and meet up to his par-ents’ expectations.” 
Katie Weber, 28, said people “go all out” 
for the Harry Potter movies in her home-town of DeKalb, Ill., something that she wished more people did in Gainesville.“I am disappointed that there are not 
more people in costumes,” Weber said. “It’s a college town. People here are just too cool to dress up.”
Before the showing, a line of fans 
wrapped around the side of the theater as people of all ages endured mosquitoes and muggy weather to be among the first to see the film.
The long line that remained at a constant 
length of a couple hundred people until just past midnight caused people to say the event was unorganized. 
Employees called people in by theater 
number, causing some to wait in line for much longer than others.
More than 1,600 advanced-purchase 
tickets for the show-
ing at Regal Gainesville Cinemas 14 were sold 
by Monday.
“This is the first time we have sold out 
for an opening in all 14 theaters,” said a Re-gal Cinemas employee who wasn’t allowed 
to talk to the press. Tuesday morning, the 
theater added three 3:30 a.m. showings to appease people who could not get tickets.
Around the world, 2,500 midnight 
screenings of the movie were sold out, ac-cording to Fandango.com, a movie and en-tertainment online ticket seller. 
 “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood 
Prince” is turning out to be one of our 
fastest-selling titles of the year and has con-
sistently been a top-seller ever since tickets went on sale on June 17,” said Rick Butler, 
chief operating officer for Fandango.Harry Potter casts spell

As confirmed and suspected swine flu 
cases climb above 2,000 in Florida, UF’s 
infirmary has seen an increase in possible flu carriers.
UF has seen several more confirmed 
cases of the virus since the first infected student in April, said Phillip Barkley, di-rector of the Student Health Care Center. Barkley said he didn’t know exactly how many more cases were confirmed.
Even though only a few more have 
been verified, there have likely been many more students infected, he said. 
The vast majority of flu cases are the 
H1N1 strain, known as swine flu, and the health center saw about 35 people with some kind of flu or flu-like symptoms last week, he said. The health center does not have the capability to test for the swine flu.
Paul Myers, assistant director of the 
Alachua County Health Department, said 90 percent or more of all flu cases now are 
of the H1N1 variety. Alachua County had 
42 confirmed cases as of Wednesday, My-ers said. The state has a total of 2,188 con-firmed or probable cases–400 of which were reported in the last week–and 12 deaths. Two of the deaths were reported Wednesday, and two of those who died were pregnant. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported more than 37,000 cases and more than 200 deaths in the United States. The actual numbers of those affected are probably much higher because most cases go unreported, Myers said. The average age of those with swine 
flu is just under 21 years old, he said, with 
most cases occurring between 5 to 24 years old. 
“That’s odd, but that’s what a novel 
strain will do,” he said.
One theory is that those older than 50 
may be more resistant to the new strain because a similar strain struck in 1957, which may have bolstered their immu-nity. It’s also odd that the flu struck in the mid- summer. Flu season usually runs from late fall to early spring, Myers said. 
However, since it’s possible that the 
center will deal with more flu cases in the fall–and that a swine flu vaccine will 
be required or recommended for college 
students–the center is preparing itself for a busier than usual semester.
“The real question is gonna be what 
kind of flu season are we gonna have this fall,” he said.Swine flu infection

Starting Nov. 1, Shands will offer 92 ad-
ditional beds, though a tighter obstetrics unit 
may mean there will be two delivering moth-ers to a room. 
“It will fit. It doesn’t mean it will be com-
fortable,” Goldfarb said. 
North Florida Regional Medical Center is 
also prepared for more patients, while the Ala-chua County Public Health Department plans to extend its hours and services. Jean Munden, Alachua County Health De-
partment administrator, said increasing the department’s operations would depend on whether or not it receives the $750,000 from low-income pool state funding, for which it has qualified and expects to receive next week. 
The department expects to admit many  of 
the low-income patients without health care who can no longer depend on AGH.
Shands at UF, Goldfarb said, has also taken 
steps to provide for patients without health in-surance by partnering with Solantic to open an urgent care center in September.
Still, some doubted Shands at UF’s ability to treat veterans and those lacking heath care. 
“Solantic is not a cheap, 
affordable option to health-care,” said a Gainesville resident and veteran at the meeting who stressed the need for a plan serving the majority of the community.  
Others said the cultural 
transition would be huge for AGH patients.
“We already know that services to the low-
income are very poor,” said Commissioner Jack Donovan, who spoke of a “population left behind.” 
Goldfarb said a bad economy and financial 
losses made closing AGH the best solution, estimating the shut down would save about $79.2 million over the next seven years. 
“As a last resort when we looked at those 
storm clouds, we said, ‘You know, we have to close AGH,’” he said. “The decision obviously was a difficult one.”
Vice President of University Relations Jane 
Adams said after the institution is dismantled, UF plans to convert the property into a tech-transfer development complex, a facility used to bring UF’s research to the marketplace.

“I’ve already told Machen this. He

However, he said if it’s going to be 
harder to drink at the Landing, UF should give students something else to do.
As a result, he said talks are underway 
to bring the band Maroon 5 to Jackson-ville to play a show outside the Landing on the Friday night before the game. He 
said Jacksonville has been asked to pick 
up the tab.
“You can’t just tell students they can’t 
come here and drink,” he said. “Let’s give them something to do.”Other members of Student Govern-
ment are fighting the proposed changes in their own way. Student Sen. Alan Yanuck is circulating a student petition and will help author a Senate resolution, which 
will likely be voted on Tuesday, opposing 
Machen’s proposals.
“On the whole, we feel that Bernie Ma-
chen, as the president of the university, should be focused more on our academic performance and the budget cuts than he should on our personal lives,” Yanuck said.
He also questioned if more safety pre-
cautions are needed since safety zones have been implemented and a student hasn’t died during the festivities since 2005.

four or five years and why do we need more regulation?” he asked.Maroon 5 may play before game

to other colleges like journalism and Fine 
Arts will receive support from the grant.
UF officials said the grant indicates the 
university has strong programs in many dif-ferent fields.
Peter Stacpoole, director of UF’s Clinical 
and Translational Science Institute, said one example of how UF will use the money is to foster research on genetic diseases and bring discoveries to the marketplace more 
efficiently.
David Guzick, former dean of the Uni-
versity of Rochester School of Medicine & 
Dentistry in New York, 
said his school used a similar grant from the NIH in 2006 to translate research on cervical can-
cer into a widely adopted vaccine.
Not only will the grant help UF, Guzick 
said, but the potential discoveries and result-ing patents will likely create local jobs and bring in more revenue to the state as well as UF.

Former Starting Line frontman introduces new project
EMILY FUGGETTA  � ALLIGATOR STAFF WRITER
It’s 15 minutes until midnight on a Sat-
urday. The bouncer sits at the entrance to 
Spannk, wrapping neon green bands around clubbers’ wrists. As they enter the bar, green and red beams of light dance through the 
thick smoke from the fog machine like laser 
confetti. 
Bodies twist and tangle on the dance floor, 
wearing glow stick halos on their heads. Some guys have sunglasses on, and one girl wears a shirt that matches the glimmer from the dis-co ball hanging from the ceiling. Everyone’s sweating; nobody cares.
In the front of the room, tucked behind 
the bar and hidden behind an old-school 
Plymouth car décor is the DJ booth. Without 
the crafting that happens in this spot, there would be no club. There would be nobody fist-pumping on the dance floor, no sweating bodies packed on the stage. Without the DJ, there would be no party.
A DJ isn’t just a person sitting in a closed 
off corner playing music off of iTunes. Mas-terminding the perfect music for a party takes 
sleepless nights and busy schedules, and there 
is a lot more to being a DJ than people are aware of.
Vijay “DJ Vi” Seixas pulls the headphones 
from his ears and looks up from his laptop. He doesn’t dance, or bob his head or even tap his feet as he spins, he concentrates on the crowd’s feedback to the music blaring through the 
speakers. The electro remix of Michael Jack-
son’s “Thriller” seems to be a hit. 
“The crowd at Spannk is awesome. They’re nuts. They scream every song,” he said.
Vijay may have been born to be a DJ with 
such a catchy name (Vijay the DJ), but he pre-fers to drop the jay. The 22-year-old started spinning after attending a electro-music festi-val in Miami with a friend when he was 18.
He said his style differs from anyone else’s 
because he introduced Gainesville to the indie-electro sound. He also began the well-known Neon Liger event that draws hundreds of ea-ger clubbers on Saturday nights.
“Usually I’m a DJ for hire, but Saturdays 
at Spannk and Tuesdays at Speakeasy are my parties,” he said. “I can do what I want and play what I want.”
His switch to a Fergie song is so natural it 
almost goes unnoticed. Everyone keeps danc-
ing.
DJ Vi says that he loves spinning in 
Gainesville because the crowd is so wild in 
this college party town.
“No one dances in Miami and the big-
ger cities. They are all more pretentious and snobby. Here it’s more party,” he said. “Here they’re college kids, they want to party and get down.”
A prominent Latin DJ in Gainesville, 
24-year-old DJ Esteban, disagrees with Vi. Al-though he has twice seen girls strip down in the booth for a song request, he said spinning in Gainesville doesn’t compare to performing in a bigger city.
“In Miami, the clubs stay open later and 
they party all night, so my sets run for five or six hours,” he said. “Here it’s only one or 
two.”
He also said that unlike Miami, most Gainesville clubs require DJs to lug their 
own equipment around, set it up, and take it down at the end of the night. In bigger cities, the clubs usually provide DJs with turntables, speakers and lights to do their jobs.
DJ Sol, 24, a popular house spinner in 
Gainesville, said that this serves as an ad-
vantage for anyone who gets into DJing. The 
equipment isn’t cheap, so only really serious DJs will make the investment. He has been ac-cumulating equipment for years; a computer with a program that holds music files, turn-tables to manipulate the sounds, headphones that allow him to listen to the next track he will mix into the current.
He said that technology has made his job 
easier than when he first started eight years ago. Computers hold thousands of songs, while before he would carry bulky record books around that couldn’t hold even close to that. The variety is crucial because he per-forms sets six out of seven days in the week.
“It’s a really busy job, and I don’t know 
if people realize that,” he said. “It can be ex-hausting.”
Along with scheduled sets at bars, social 
events and private parties, DJs’ jobs require them to have a social life outside the clubs. Sol said that after parties are a daily routine, and they often take place at his house. 
“Then there’s all the other things that come 
with knowing everyone in Gainesville. It’s al-ways somebody’s birthday, farewell party or welcome party,” he said. “Not to mention my sleeping schedule is totally thrown off.”
But having a daytime job that allows for a 
normal sleeping pattern doesn’t seem to work for DJ Sol. He has tried; he always go back to being a DJ.
He may not have time to experience a social 
life of his own outside of the DJ world, but the good thing about the profession lies in having fun and working at the same time. The better 
night he has, the more likely it is that he’s con-
necting with the crowd through his music.
Lady Cherelle, 33, says that communica-
tion with a crowd through music is what 
separates a good DJ from a bad one. As a very popular house DJ who has played around the country, she feels that music is a universal lan-guage that she can reflect her personality and life through.
As a female DJ, like other industries, she 
faces some discrimination, but she doesn’t let 
it affect her. If someone blindly puts in her CD 
without looking at the cover, it would be next to impossible to interpret her gender.
“A good DJ is a good DJ, either male or fe-
male,’’ she says.
And ultimately, she advises that a good DJ 
becomes a producer. It opens up opportuni-ties to get music heard across more avenues.
“To me, being a DJ is about spreading the 
art of music around the world,” she says. “That’s my goal. That’s what I want to do.”
DJs spin parties to life at Gainesville’s bars, clubs
MEAGAN MCGONE  � AVENUE WRITERContributed photo 
Person L, which consists of band members Brian Medlin, Charles Schneider, Nathaniel Vaeth, Kenneth 
Vasoli and Ryan Zimmaro, will headline a show at 1982 Bar Tuesday night.
“To me, being a DJ is about 
spreading the art of music 
around the world.”
LADY CHERELLE
DJYou might know him as the 
frontman for The Starting Line, but 
Gainesville is about to get a new 
picture of Kenneth Vasoli.
Vasoli’s newest brainchild, Per-
son L, is described on the band’s 
Web site as experimental/indie/
melodramatic popular song, and 
Vasoli said it’s a major step in a different direction than The Start-ing Line’s pop-punk style.
“When I entered my 20s...my 
interest led me to rock and roll and and I found a lot of other stuff that interested me like jazz, soul, blues and electronic music,” the 25-year-
old singer said.  “My hunger to 
do other stuff had gotten really strong. That was the big motiva-tion behind doing something dif-ferent.”
Vasoli said that at first he tried 
to work his new ideas into The Starting Line but decided to start Person L when other band mem-
bers didn’t respond enthusiasti-
cally.
“After a while, I realized that 
The Starting Line should be it’s own thing,” said Vasoli, who cites 
The Battles, Radiohead and Drive 
Like Jehu as major musical influ-ences. 
“I shouldn’t have to force a 
square into a circle, stuff that 
didn’t belong there into The Start-
ing Line,” he said. 
After Person L was formed, Va-
soli started his own record label, Human Interest, which donates a 
portion of all record sales to char-ity.
“Human interest is a way of 
getting (the music) out there while still doing something positive,” he said. “We pretty much just give 
what we can.”But Vasoli said there’s a deli-
cate balance between trying to earn 
money and keeping the band’s voice intact. 
“We would never do anything 
to sacrifice the creativity of what 
we do,” he said. “Mainstream is 
not really what we’re looking for.”
Vasoli said he’s happy with the 
modest success Person L is build-ing and doesn’t regret moving on 
from The Starting Line, which en-
joyed a comfy spot on the Billboard Chart for all three of the band’s al-bums.
“I miss it sometimes, but I don’t 
think The Starting Line is neces-sarily done for forever,” he said. “I get so much satisfaction out of what we’re doing with Person L that even though it’s not the suc-
cess story The Starting Line was, I 
don’t regret anything.”
Person L is an infant in the mu-
sic world. The band’s first album “Initial” was released in August, 
and the second album “The Posi-
tives,” is slated for later this sum-mer —but Vasoli said the tour is running smoothly so far.
“I measure tours based on how 
much fun I’m having,” he said. “And I’m having a ton on this one.”
The Gainesville performance 
— which will also feature the Gay Blades — will be Person L’s only headline show of the tour, and Vasoli said he’s a little bit nervous 
because two members of the five-
piece ensemble won’t be present.
“It’ll be a scramble,” he said. 
“But as long as there’s more than 12 people, I’ll be smiling ear to 
ear.”
But Vasoli said he doesn’t get 
discouraged when the crowds are 
sparse.
“I expect there to be no one who 
knows who we are, and if there are some, I’m pleasantly surprised,” he said. “We’re so new and such a shift in gears from what they expect that I expect to pay a lot of 
dues, and I still am.”
The performance will be at 1982 
Bar on Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. Ad-
vance tickets are available at tick-
etweb.com and Hear Again CDs 
and DVDs for $10.  THURSDAY, JULY 16, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 15
It is the year of open-minded-
ness. We have a black president, and 
there’s a good chance we’ll have our first Hispanic Supreme Court judge.  
States are falling to gay marriage 
faster than the value of the Ameri-
can dollar. And the number one sell-ing genre of music in our modern times is country. 
That’s right folks, good ol’ down 
home country twang is outselling pop, rock and hip-hop.
Country music may be formulaic, 
but that’s where the beauty lies. It is 
an unpretentious sound that aims to 
pull you in to its web of comforting familiarity. 
Country tells stories we can all 
relate to. If we can get past our initial prejudices, we may discover some-thing beautifully relevant. Country music is the soundtrack to your life. 
�When you inevitably real-
ize your major will make you 
about as much money as work-ing at a drive-thru:  
“Marry for Money” — Trace 
Adkins: A story of the male gold digger. Adkins wants to find a “sweet sugar mama, with a whole lot of zeroes and commas.” He doesn’t care what she looks like, or if she’s too fat or old. His last line: “Come over here you good looking thing, you, there’s your walker in the corner.” 
�When the “I guess he’s my 
boyfriend” guy comes knock-
ing on your door at 4 a.m.:  
“Don’t Come Home A’ Drinkin’ 
(with lovin’ on your mind)” — Lo-retta Lynn: The ode to the poor girl who only gets to see her “boyfriend” twice a week for three minutes of 
sloppy love followed by 10 hours of 
loud snoring. It’s time to move on dear.
�When your man meets a girl 
who you think is super hot:  
“Jolene” — Dolly Parton: The sad, humbling truth that she could get him if she wanted to. Only he’s a loser, so you don’t really have to worry. The White Stripes do a great 
cover of this. Don’t get too excited 
hipsters, that Ray LaMontagne song only shares 
the name.
�When 
your boss 
sucks, you go on a lunch break and get wasted:  
“It’s 5 o’clock 
somewhere”— Alan Jackson and 
Jimmy Buffet: Probably the best ra-tionalization for getting drunk I’ve ever heard. Ironic, because these 
two have more money combined 
than the GDP of Kenya.
�When you have a million Mys-
pace friends but no girlfriend:  
“So much cooler online” — Brad Paisley: Everyone likes to beef up their stats online, but no one wants to admit it. Paisley tells it like it is, saying that “even on a slow day I 
can have a three way, chat with two 
women at one time.” Let’s party.
�When you’re breaking up and 
pathetically trying to divide up the things that you bought 
together:  
“Give it away” — George Strait: 
We all know the scene, you want to hold on to that key chain you bought at the gas station on the way to that concert, because it’s “im-
portant” to you, but really you’re 
just bitter. The worst part is your ex could care less.
�When you think you need 
to drink a few to come out of 
your shell and always end up overdoing it:  
“The more I drink” — Blake Shel-
ton: We all know what happens when we just try to have a few. We start bumming smokes, hitting on fat chicks and sometimes end up in 
bed next to someone who should 
never come out in the daytime. Oh Beer, how I love thee.  
�When that skeeze who 
cheated on you tries to slut 
her way back into your life:  
“Here’s a quarter (call someone who 
cares)” — Travis Tritt: This is the ul-timate f-you song to that slutty mis-creant who did you wrong. The best revenge is when she comes crawl-ing back to you and you dis her like 
there’s no tomorrow. 
�When you have that first amaz-
ing weekend with that new 
special someone in your life:  
“Just got started lovin’ you” — 
James Otto: Oh, new love. Before you meet her parents and realize she’s needy, loves to nag and needs psychiatric help. Maybe that’s just 
my experience. 
�When your girlfriend fi-
nally gets sick of your shit:  
“Maybe she’ll get lonely” — Jack 
Ingram: A cautionary tale of upset-ting the love of your life one time too many. She leaves you in the dust, and your only hope is that she’ll miss you.  
This is but a smattering of the 
many country songs that will catch us when we fall. 
In the year of open-mindedness 
it’s time to embrace our differences, open a 12-pack of Busch light, and let the music take us away. Country music offers support, advice for all stages of life

Vinyl records displayed on the wall at Sharpe’s Music located at 1219 W University Ave. Store owner, Ted 
Sharpe has noticed an increase in record sales recently. 16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 16, 2009 THURSDAY, JULY 16, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 17
While the CD bows out to digital 
music in terms of convenience, vi-
nyl records are making a comeback 
nationwide with listeners who want more than a sound file.
Local vinyl vendors are seeing the 
national trend show up in their shops as well.
Ted Sharpe, who designed jazz 
and western vinyl covers in the ‘60s and now owns Sharpe’s Music on 
West University Avenue, noticed a 
steady increase several years ago.
“I’ve always been told ‘get out of 
vinyl, it’s dead,’” he said.
He now sells about 10 records for 
every CD, with classic rock such as The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Led Zep-pelin and jazz selling the best.
With the increase of online music 
sales, Sharpe believes that some lis-teners have begun to crave something they can hold.
“The record has so much more 
personality,” Sharpe said. “Each one is a little piece of history.,”
Sharpe believes that records 
sound better than digital files, a sen-timent echoed by fellow vinyl lovers 
but hotly contested by many fans of 
MP3s and similar formats.
But Tony Wienbender, spokes-
man for No Idea records, believes the local folk-punk label has found a solution to the disagreement: provide a digital download code with every vinyl record.
No Idea presses vinyl records for 
all of the bands they sign. Hot Water Music and Against Me! sell the best.
Sometimes, the label will offer sev-eral versions of art with each album release, replacing the standard black 
vinyl with swirled colors and having 
multiple versions of cover art. Die-hard collectors will often purchase four copies of the same album to col-lect the different art versions.
Records have been the traditional 
medium for punk music, and some other labels have embraced the resur-gence so whole heartedly that they’ve stopped selling CDs. 
But Wienbender feels that goes 
too far.
“It’s a knee-jerk reaction, and 
that’s kinda stupid,” he said.
National resurgence of records noted locally
HUNTER SIZEMORE � ALLIGATOR STAFF WRITER
T13C! is a band on a mission. 
While pursuing its passion and sharing its 
music on the road, the band is helping protect 
the environment. 
The band recently teamed up with CREx, a 
local nonprofit initiative started by Earth Giv-
ers, to make its recent tour carbon neutral. 
This summer, the band completed a 2,963-
mile, 19-show in-state tour. With the help of CREx, the band offset the environmental impact from its tour van and the electrical consumption at their venues.
Joe Loffredo, 28, and Mike Loffredo, 28, 
are Gainesville residents, twin brothers and bandmates in T13C!. 
They sport beards and wear the same jeans 
to interviews. Joe sometimes wears a knitted cap on his head to avoid being confused for his brother.  
T13C! appeared on the first season of 
“America’s Got Talent” with David Hassel-
hoff.
“Hasslehoff is taller than most people 
think,” Joe said. “I thought he was absolutely 
huge to be honest with you.”
 “He’s as tall as a light post,” Mike said.The Gainesville-based band has three 
national tours and more than 20 in-state tours under its belt. 
With its last tour the band decided to use 
the stage to educate its fans about the environ-ment. 
But the band is not just jumping on the 
“green” wagon for the sake of  being trendy. The guys are committed to teaching young 
people what they can do to help the environ-
ment. 
“We’ve recycled ever since we were kids,” 
Joe said. “That’s just something our parents 
instilled in us.” 
T13C! kept a recycling bag at all times in its 
touring van and at shows the members taught 
audiences about ways to help reduce their carbon footprint — the total set of greenhouse 
gas emissions caused directly or indirectly by 
people or organizations.
“There are basic things you can do to help,” 
Joe said. “I think every kid in Gainesville has a computer. Turn it off at night.”
When electronics are left plugged in all day 
the electronics draw energy, this affects wal-lets and the environment adversely.
“It’s like your own personal economic 
stimulus,” Joe said.
The band also promotes the efficiency of 
quick showers. 
“We don’t shave very often either,” Mike 
Loffredo said.
The members said carpooling, bike riding 
and public transportation, and if someone must drive, scooters are great alternatives to driving a car.  
“You also get a free hug out of it,” Joe said, 
about rising scooters. “When two people are on a scooter one person hugs the other.”
The band chose to work with CREx because 
of the company’s commitment to creating locally based carbon dioxide reductions in Gainesville.
“We were thrilled to be able to work with 
such a great band on such a unique and 
worthwhile project,” said Jacob Cravey, co-
founder of Earth Givers.
CREx calculated that T13C! would produce 
10 tons of carbon dioxide during the month-
long tour. 
About 75 percent came from travel, and 25 
percent was attributed to venue environment.
The neutrality of the tour has been certified 
by an independent third-party verifier. 
ClimateSafe examined the emissions 
caused by the tour and the reductions created 
by CREx. 
Once it was determined that the reductions 
equaled the emissions, the tour was certified neutral.
Joe and Mike said they plan to book eco-
friendly tours from now on.
However, if their rock-star dreams don’t 
pan out they have backup plans.
 Joe said he always wanted to be an FBI 
agent.
 Mike is a band director at a Catholic 
middle school.
“I’m also a pretty good baby sitter,” Joe 
saidlocal music

18, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 16, 2009
Music and film don’t always 
synch up. While some try to hard 
to push the entertainment factor 
with forced tour bus orgies and unlimited profanity, others come up dry. But among the failed at-tempts, some music-related films mesh both genres of entertainment 
in perfect harmony. 
Cameron Crowe’s film about 
an aspiring rock journalist holds 
its own as both a mockumentary and an award-winning picture. As a film, “Almost Famous” has a ter-
rific screenplay, great direction and 
standout performances by Patrick 
Fugit, Kate Hudson, Jason Lee and Billy Crudup. The film, based on Crowe’s experience as a journalist 
with Rolling Stone magazine, was 
technically a box office flop, but 10 years later it watches just as well as 
when it came out. 
A mockumentary of sorts, 
“This is Spinal Tap” explores the 
1982 U.S. tour of fictional heavy-metal band, Spinal Tap. Rob Rein-er, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer wrote and also played pivotal roles in the film. “This is Spinal Tap” parodies heavy-metal bands of the 80s while being funny, realistic and fresh. Since its release in 1984, the film became a cult success, and in 2002 the Library of Congress added it to the National Film Registry.
Although, more of a romantic 
comedy, “High Fidelity” relies on 
music to get its point across. The movie comes off as a little dated when you listen to John Cusack rant about how to make the perfect mix tape. But it’s the ranting that 
makes the movie so good. With a 
well-written screenplay, a terrific 
performance by John Cusack and 
plenty of music references, “High Fidelity” is the romantic comedy 
for the music lover. 
“The Last Waltz” is a triumph as 
both a concert and film. The movie 
covers the last concert of The Band after 16 years on the road. Just 
as The Band made a lasting im-
pression on rock and roll, Martin 
Scorsese made a lasting influence 
on concert filmmaking when he directed “The Last Waltz” in 1978. 
Boasting beautiful cinematography 
and camera work, the film feels less 
like a concert movie and more like 
a blockbuster film. The movie, just under two hours long, keeps view-
ers compelled with supplemental band interviews in between terrific 
live performances.
It may be the Gainesville con-
nection that makes “Runnin’ 
Down a Dream” so compelling. The film, tracing Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers’ career, opens with 
live concert footage from the bands 
Sept. 21, 2006 performance at the 
Stephen C. O’Connell Center. The film traces the band’s beginnings in Gainesville, complete with 
home video footage. As the movie 
continues, Gainesville becomes far 
less prominent as The Heartbreak-
ers makes its move toward success, but clips of the Gainesville show 
appear throughout to remind you 
of the bands humble origins. The 
various celebrity interviews from 
people like Johnny Depp, Dave Grohl and Stevie Nicks, along with 
the momentum built up by inter-views with the chronology of the 
band, keeps audiences captivated 
throughout the almost four-hour-
long film. 
More than just an album, “A 
Hard Day’s Night” was also a rev-
olutionary British film. The 1964 
comedy uses a mock documentary 
format that shows a few days of 
The Beatles’ lives.
With a simple plot line filled 
with numerous gags, the movie 
is enjoyable and fun to watch, al-
though it can feel a little dated.The 
real importance of the film comes 
less from its musical inspiration and more from its film format.
Director Richard Lester’s use of 
hand-held cameras, quick cutting 
and even the decision to film the 
movie in black and white are ele-ments of cinematic style that still 
influence films today.

sex on the avenueMusicians’ melodies leave women wanting more
Meagan McGone
ColumnistGREG FINK  � AVENUE CONTRIBUTING WRITER
MEAGAN MCGONE  � AVENUE WRITER
It’s practically a scientific fact that women 
have a sexual fascination with musicians.
Exhibit A: My mother, a woman so con-
servative about sex that I thought my birth 
may have been through the Immaculate 
Conception. But give her tickets to a Poison 
concert and she’ll shimmy into her skin-tight leather pants and snap on a lacy, red bra be-fore Bret Michaels can even sing the words “talk dirty to me.” 
Then there is my 15-year-old sister, who 
still thinks boys have cooties, but melts any time a Jonas brother’s curly locks bounce across the Disney Channel screen.
And finally, there is me. I’m not crazy 
about a famous rocker, or a tween pop star, but the first time I heard my boyfriend play, I instantly wanted him. His Beatles T-shirt, self-assurance and 12-string acoustic guitar set off a “great sex!” flag in my brain.
So what is the appeal in men that can 
play music? Take away the instruments and the sappy lyrics, and aren’t they just normal men?
Actually, no. One time, I was on a date 
with a guy, and as I stepped into his car I almost crushed his guitar strings that he had “coincidentally” placed in my seat. “Watch the strings!” he exclaimed. “I have to restring my baby when I get home!”
Just like a Gucci bag, women can smell 
a phony. It’s not sexy to boast about skills that probably don’t exist. And if a man has to learn to play a guitar to get girls, he prob-ably doesn’t have the confidence to rock out anyway. What makes a mu-
sician sexy is his 
talent, and talent takes depth.
To women, the 
depth that shines through the music parallels with the 
passion he’ll have in the relationship.
From a realistic sense, to be attracted to a 
musician seems a little silly. A muscular con-struction worker with a body that promises 
to be her bodyguard and highlights his abil-
ity to handle her in bed should be more ap-pealing to a woman’s eye. Yet rockers with their teenage-girl sized jeans, are the most sought after men on the earth, and it’s due to their appearance on the inside. The sensitive lyrics and passionate guitar playing indicate 
that musicians make great lovers. If they can 
make a piece of wood sing that way, imag-ine what they could do to you. 
Once, I had a huge fight in a romantic 
cabin on Valentine’s Day with the musician I fell for. After slamming doors and fuming through moments of silence, he took his gui-tar by the lake, and I trailed behind him. 
He played a song that he had written 
for me, and as much as I tried to fight it, my feelings of anger quickly vanished. It may 
sound really cliché or even cheesy, but what 
happened in the bedroom afterward defi-nitely was not.

Gainesville is the cradle of  start-
up bands. As new bands pop up left 
and right, there inevitably comes a point, at which they must drift on. After the diplomas have been hand-ed, the career pressures start to pile on, bands are left with three choices: stay put, break up or leave the nest.
Gainesville bands Debutaunts, 
Umoja Orchestra and Squeaky have reached that point.
“What’s in Gainesville anyway?” 
Debutaunts frontman Jazek Creacy said.
The determined, young, four-
piece, indie/rock/pop band had its ﬁ  rst show at Club Red in 2006. 
Since then, the band has had several 
breaks and is looking to get out of Gainesville as soon as possible.
Creacy said the Gainesville mu-
sic scene has fallen apart and is now dominated by hillbilly punk rockers and friend-based college bands, but notes Gainesville as a great place to get a footing.
“If it’s taught me anything, it’s 
that everybody has to have a start-ing point,” Creacy said.
But to grow, the guys feel they 
have to branch out. 
After meeting through gaines-
vilebands.com, the members began playing shows around town. 
Debutaunts recorded its ﬁ  rst EP 
in 2007 with Sky Lab Records and sent it to Universal Records. This 
booked the band a showcase in 
New York, where it hooked up with Grammy-nominated producer Matt Goldman.
“Now, we’re in a position where 
we have the right people behind us to take a larger step,” Creacy said.
In September the band is moving 
to Atlanta where it will be record-
ing with Goldman for two months. 
From there the band will launch a national tour to promote the album.
“We’re not going to stop until we’ve taken it as far as it can go,” Creacy said.
With the move to Atlanta com-
ing up, Debutaunts will be too busy for a farewell show, but it will try to make a stop during its tour.
Umoja Orchestra, Gainesville’s 
14-piece Latin/afro-beat/funk 
band, has chosen another route: for 
now,  it’s staying put. But, with two members in different corners of the world, the band is putting things on hold.
In 2005, Umoja had its ﬁ  rst live 
performance at University Audito-rium for Hispanic Heritage month where it won “best in dance,” a cap-
tion that some of Umoja’s members 
still question the validity of.
They set off playing shows all 
over Gainesville, rehearsing in Jen-
nings Hall dorm rooms where they 
were often interrupted by RAs tell-ing them to quiet down.
After three years and three al-
bums, the band decided to put things on hold after David Boren-stein (saxophone) and Jason Prover (trumpet) left. Borenstein is headed to China to study Chinese politi-
cal science, and Prover is attending 
New York University for master’s degree in jazz. But, that isn’t to say they won’t be missing the town they started in.
“I miss the community aspect of 
Gainesville,” Prover said. “Every-thing’s a free-for-all [in New York], man.”
The band took Prover and Boren-
stein’s absences hard and refused to replace the two members. The band revels in its fraternal ways and func-tion on love and friendship. After all, “umoja” is Swahili for “unity.”
“Umoja is the only band, I feel, is 
one cohesive unit,” Micah Shalom, trombone player, said.
There is still speculation that the 
band may continue. The ﬂ  ier for its last show on April 17, 2008, read “last show for a while.”
“We have to retool and kind of 
rethink things, but it’s deﬁ  nitely still an option,” Shalom said.
For some bands, however, re-
uniting is not an option. Squeaky, a four-piece indie rock band will not 
be continuing after its drummer, 
Danny Welsh, moves back to Mem-phis, Tenn.
The band has been around since 
1995 and is sick of ﬁ  nding new drummers, said frontman Harry Monkhorst.
With the exception of Welsh, 
Squeaky is a band of middle-aged 
men living the married life with 
kids. The musicians list ‘70s AM ra-dio as one of their inﬂ  uences as well as older bands like Superchunk, Arches of Loaf and Fugazzi.
They started the band mainly as 
a way to get away from the family and act like 12-year-old boys again, bassist Steven Bottom said.
“We just had to play music, or 
we’d go crazy,” Bottom said.
Monkhorst considers the 
band Gainesville natives. Out of Gainesville he has gained love for his bandmates, hearing loss, broken cymbals, broken strings, smiles and, above all, fun times. Monk-horst said he can’t understand why 
bands leave Gainesville.
To up-and-coming bands in 
Gainesville Monkhorst offers this 
advice: “Do it because you love it, not because you want anyone to like it.”Local bands prepare to move on

If you do anything this summer, go to a music festival. The 
summer’s music festivals are kicking off soon, and they are competing 
to have the biggest little bands, host the greenest event and to all in all be the one festival that will be worth your time and money. Who will win this winner-take-all ﬁ  ght? No one knows yet, but these shows are 
sure to be the most blogged and bragged about events of the sum-
mer. 
Warped Tour, Orlando — July 24; St. Petersburg: July 26Featuring: 30H!3, All Time Low, Bayside, Streetlight Manifesto, 
Senses Fail, Less than Jake, Chiodos, Bouncing Souls, Underoath.
Being located in Florida, is deﬁ  nitely a plus, and at $34.76, the day-
long show is less of a commitment than the more expensive, multiple-day concerts. The downside: Being in an awkward and underrepre-
sented age group — too old to identify with the young teens secretly 
smoking cigarettes, and too young to be the creepy 30-something man, 
buying beer for kids, in a desparate attempt to recapture his youth.
Fuji Rock Festival, Niigata, Japan — July 24-26Featuring: Oasis, Franz Ferdinand, Weezer, Fall Out Boy, Lily Al-
len, Jimmy Eat World, Public Enemy, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Di-nosaur Jr., Bright Eyes, Peaches.
This three-day, 12-stage event on Mount Takenoko typically 
draws crowds of more than 100,000 people and features on-site camp-grounds. Imagine innocently dropping this during a conversation: “Oh, I went to this super-cool music festival in Japan and camped out in the mountains.” Who could top that? No one. More than 100 bands will perform. 
All Points West, Jersey City — July 31-Aug. 2Featuring: Vampire Weekend, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, MSTRKRFT, 
Coldplay, Lykke Li, We Are Scientists, Mogwai, Crystal Castles, Steel Train, The Ting Tings.
All Points West is probably the most well-rounded of the summer 
festivals. With bands from Tool to MGMT and comedians like Tim 
and Eric and Janeane Garofalo, it has something to offer to almost any-
one. Watching such a diverse group of music fans try to interact with each other should be a bonus source of entertainment too.
Lollapalooza, Chicago — Aug. 7-9 Featuring: The Killers, Beastie Boys, Snoop Dogg, TV on the Ra-
dio, Animal Collective, Band of Horse, Of Montreal, Fleet Foxes, Ben 
Folds, Bon Iver.
A three-day show with a diverse lineup of more than 80 big-name 
bands and little indies that make it worth the $205 and trip to Chi-
town. You could also win a 2010 Honda Insight hybrid by reﬁ  lling your water bottles, recycling or riding a bike to the show.

There are three events that consis-
tently mark the middle of July on my calendar — the release of 
the annual update to EA Sports’ NCAA Football game (which my colleague Adam Berry so generously opined on in Tuesday’s paper), my birthday (today, time to do it big) and the always-inter-esting ESPY Awards.
The show is sadly not broadcast live 
— it was taped Wednesday and will 
air Sunday at 9 p.m. — but enjoyable nonetheless if for no other reason than 
because it’s a chance to remember all 
the sweet sports moments from the year before.
For UF fans, there is the attraction of 
Tim Tebow competing as one possible 
reason to watch. The rising senior is up for Best Male College Athlete and Best Moment.

LEGE A ThLETE:  
When I was handi-
capping this race, I 
came into it think-
ing I wouldn’t 
pick Tebow but 
couldn’t convince 
myself of anyone who was better. Okla-
homa quarterback Sam Bradford lost to him in the BCS National Championship Game (and it’s not like he was ridicu-lously better during the regular season). San Diego State pitcher Stephen Stras-burg is a phenom, but I have to down-grade him for not getting his team past its NCAA Regional. Oklahoma forward Tebow will go home with an ESPYI don’t envy David Letterman. Putting 
together a top 10 list can be fairly dif-
ficult.  
At a school like UF, with a success-
ful sports program and plenty of talented 
athletes, narrowing down the pack to 10 
players was not a particularly easy task for 
myself and the five other alligatorSports columnists. Some, like Phil Kegler, went 
through a ridiculous multi-step process to 
create their lists. Phil may have even used 
matrices, for all I know.
Readers of the paper and listeners of the 
alligatorSports Podcast have sent in a few 
e-mails making perfectly valid arguments 
for people who had great years but didn’t 
make the list. And while we couldn’t make a top 25 list — there are only so many pa-
pers in a semester — I’d like to recognize 
some of the athletes who just missed the 
cut. This list is in no particular order, but it 
emphasizes the smaller-sport athletes who 
weren’t recognized for their accomplish-
ments. 
KELLY MURPhY , VOLLEYBALL: Elyse Cusack took the 10th spot 
on our list due to 
her all-around suc-
cess and leader-
ship, but Murphy 
was the breakout 
star of the 2008 
season for the vol-leyball team. She 
was named the 
Southeastern Con-
ference Freshman 
of the Year and picked up national fresh-man of the year awards from two different 
organizations. She finished 11th in our vot-
ing, but I feel like she was more than wor-
thy of the top 10.

TURNBERRY, Scotland— British bookmakers have listed 
Rory McIlroy as the third favorite at Turnberry, unusual for 
someone playing in his first British Open as a pro.
Stranger still is that he doesn’t seem fazed, perhaps because 
his age (20) matches the odds (20-1).
McIlroy already has shown in small doses that he is capa-
ble.
He comes from Holywood — a coastal town in Northern 
Ireland, not to be confused with the glitz of Los Angeles — and already is easily recognized by his freckles and curly brown hair that tumbles out of his cap and over his ears. He made his British Open debut as a teenager two years ago at Carnoustie and opened with a 68 on the toughest links in golf.
And without knowing it, he can put on quite the exhibition.
On a surprisingly sun-splashed day along the Ayrshire 
Coast, McIlroy found a flat part of the putting green Wednes-
day, and his caddie marked off 8 feet with a chalk line. The kid hit three balls at a time, stopping to chat, constantly smiling, not really paying attention.
He made 105 putts in a row, seemed to lose interest, then 
moved on to another hole 30 feet away.
One reason he is getting so much attention, beyond the tal-
ent that allowed him to win the Dubai Desert Classic this year 
and rise to No. 22 in the world ranking, is the constant search 
for someone to challenge Tiger Woods.
Even at golf’s oldest championship, the focus turns to 
youth.
McIlroy will be playing the first two rounds with 24-year-
old Anthony Kim, who is No. 15 in the world and an explosive talent. Martin Kaymer, the 24-year-old German, is coming off consecutive victories on the European Tour and can became the first player since Seve Ballesteros in 1986 to make it three in a 
row.

Stacey Nelson did not receive 
the national recognition Tim Tebow 
did, but she may have been better at her sport than any other athlete in Gainesville.
Nelson led the Gators to two 
straight Women’s College World Series appearances, falling just short this year in the championship series against Washington. 
Her relaxed, humble attitude off 
the field was matched only by her intensity and dominance once she 
stepped into the 
circle. With 41 
wins, Nelson led 
the Gators to a 63-5 record and a No. 1 ranking for most of the sea-son.
Nelson was so 
instrumental in 
making the Gators softball program a national-championship contender that coach Tim Walton said she, along with senior Kim Waleszonia, will be honored even after their four outstanding years on the field.
“As long as I coach here, you 
won’t ever see a No. 5 (Waleszonia), you won’t ever see a No. 42 (Nelson) 
on anybody else’s back,” Walton 
said. “We don’t really retire num-bers, but they won’t be worn as long as I’m the coach here at the Univer-sity of Florida.”
After a wildly successful junior 
year and a run to the school’s first WCWS, Nelson faced high expec-tations entering her senior year — maybe even the possibility that the miraculous 70-5 season in 2008 couldn’t be topped.
Not only did she meet the expec-tations, she surpassed them.
In 2008, Nelson joked that no-
hitters might not be her thing — the one accomplishment a pitcher who had seemingly done it all could not yet add to her list. In 2009, Nelson threw two of them. She also became the first Gator to strike out 1,000 bat-ters and holds nearly every pitching mark in the UF record books.
With that kind of success, it’s easy 
to assume she would be aware of her stats and each record she owns. But not Nelson, who won the Lowe’s Se-
nior CLASS Award for her achieve-
ments on and off the field.
“People don’t believe me when I 
say I don’t know my stats,” Nelson said, “but I really don’t.”
Even the list of accolades Nelson 
earned near the end of and after her final season is remarkable. In addi-tion to the Senior CLASS Award, 
she was a top-three finalist for the 
USA Softball Collegiate  Player of the Year, earned first-team All-America honors from two different organizations and, perhaps most impressively, was selected as one 
of five pitchers on the USA Softball 
Women’s National Team. 
For dominating opponents this 
season and during her entire career, as well as staking her claim as the 
best pitcher in program history, Sta-
cey Nelson is the alligatorSports No. 2 UF Athlete of 2008-09.
BY THE NUMBERS: Nelson is the sec-
ond athlete to receive a vote from all six panelists. She received four 
second-place votes, one third-place 
vote and one fourth-place vote.THURSDAY, JULY 16, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 29

In 107 words, Tim Tebow went from 
hyped hero to living legend.
“To the fans and everybody in Gator Nation, 
I’m sorry. I’m extremely sorry. We were hop-
ing for an undefeated season. That was my goal, 
something Florida has never done here.
“I promise you one thing — a lot of good will 
come out of this. You will never see any player 
in the entire country play as hard as I will play the rest of the season. You will never see someone push the rest of his team as hard as I will push everybody the rest of the season. You will never see a team play harder than we will the rest of the season.
“God bless.”Tebow has made plenty of big plays — 
most notably his fourth-and-1 conversion at Tennessee in 2006 and his entire record-setting Heisman-winning campaign of 2007 — but now he had failed in the unlikeliest of moments.
The Gators had been upset. At home. 
Against an unranked Mississippi team. Hav-ing failed on a final fourth-and-1, the spot where Tebow had been seen as automatic.
But when he looked at his worst, he was 
actually at his best. His words became a ral-lying cry for teammates and fans.
These words would have rung hollow had 
the Gators not responded the way they did. UF won its remaining 10 games by double digits, including eight by 28 points or more.
And this is why Tebow was unanimously 
picked as our top UF athlete for last year.
In his junior season, he ran a prolific of-
fense that averaged 43.6 points per game while once again leading the Gators in pass-ing and rushing yards and totaling 42 touch-downs. Tebow fell short of a second straight Heis-
man Trophy, finishing third, but earned more first-place votes than winner Sam Bradford and runner-up Colt McCoy.
But he was at his best during the team’s 
two biggest games.
The Jacksonville native earned BCS Most 
Outstanding Offensive Player honors after throwing for 231 yards and two touchdowns and adding 109 yards on the ground.
This came a month after Tebow earned 
Southeastern Conference Championship MVP honors, going 14 of 22 with 216 pass-ing yards and 57 rushing yards, including a 5-yard touchdown pass to Riley Cooper on 
a slant that sealed the game with 2:50 remaining.
“I’ve had some great 
players, and I’ve got some 
great players on this team,” UF coach Urban Meyer said after the game. “But I’ve never had one like this. Tim’s got something spe-cial inside him. 
“I’m not talking about throwing. I’m not 
talking about running. I’m talking about making everyone around him better. That fourth quarter was vintage Tim Tebow.”
He made an otherwise boring national 
championship celebration inside The Swamp immediately newsworthy with his drawn-out, climactic announcement:
“... Oh and by the way, one more thing — 
let’s do it again. I’m coming back!”
After living up to this year’s promise, it’s 
hard to doubt his next one.
For his near-miraculous leadership in 
leading the Gators to their second national championship in three years while solidify-ing his place as one of the best college foot-ball players of all time, Tim Tebow is the al-
ligatorSports No. 1 UF Athlete of 2008-09.THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
HATTIESBURG, Miss. — Brett 
Favre acknowledged he’s “running out 
of time” to decide whether he’ll play for the Minnesota Vikings this season.
The quarterback told The Associat-
ed Press on Wednesday that he’ll give the Vikings an answer on whether he’ll play by July 30. Favre has been working out with the Oak Grove High School football team three days a week but added a Sunday workout this week.
“There’s two weeks left and I’m 
doing everything I can,” Favre said. “I was down here Sunday morning work-
ing out. I’m trying to get everything to 
where I feel 100 percent when I go in. I can’t go in any less. When you’re 39 years old, it’s hard enough. But it’s get-ting there.”
The former Packers and Jets quar-
terback said surgery to repair a biceps tendon in his throwing arm was suc-cessful and that he has enough veloc-
ity to return to the NFL. He’s just not 
sure whether that means he’ll be able to compete for an entire season.
“I felt like going to New York last 
year that I still had it,” Favre said. “I didn’t know my arm was hurt at the time. So that’s what I try to get across to people. I had that fixed, the surgery to fix that, so I’m trying to make sure 
that if I go back that part is completely 
resolved.”
It sure looked like it Wednesday 
morning when a jovial Favre threw a variety of passes to high school and college wide receivers. He was crisp on short timing passes and was hitting re-ceivers in the end zone from about 50 yards away. He attempted a few deep passes off bootlegs and usually hit his targets in stride. Favre’s spirals held true and he proved he still has plenty of 
zip when he tossed a deep pass to a col-
lege receiver who dropped by to work out. The pass split the receiver’s hands and hit him in the face.30, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 16, 2009

Favre will make decision by July 30
did not win a championship, and despite being the 
easy No. 1 pick in this year’s NBA Draft, he just didn’t impress me in his sport as much as Tebow did in his. 
Boston University hockey player Matt Gilroy 
may be getting undervalued by me, as his team 
won a title, and I’m admittedly not the biggest col-lege hockey buff. But after looking up his back-ground, he doesn’t seem to be a clear level above 
Tebow, and I’m sure voters will be more inclined 
to pick someone from a bigger sport.
BeSt MOMeNt: This category, unbelievably 
enough, is actually the one I think in which Tebow will come up short. Tebow’s The Promise is go-
ing up against just two other events — Helio Cas-
troneves winning the Indy 500 and the U.S. men’s 
swim team’s thrilling finish in the 4x100m freestyle relay during the 2008 Olympics. Castroneves’ vic-tory shortly after being found innocent on tax eva-
sion charges is a story that greatly tugs at your 
heartstrings, but as a “sports moment,” it falls far 
behind the other two to me.  
Listening to The Promise in person is certainly 
a moment I’ll never forget, and I think it will be 
well-remembered based on how the Gators fin-ished the season. But the 2008 Olympics swim-ming competition and Michael Phelps’ quest for eight golds stole a nation’s hearts. In this particular race (which ranked No. 4 in my column Tuesday as far as the Top 10 Sporting Events I Wish I Saw 
Live), the Americans edged the French by .08 of a 
second after trailing by .18 of a second with 50 me-ters left. Jason Lezak, the team’s anchor, swam the best 100 meters of his life with the fastest split of all time, preserving Phelps’ quest for eight golds (he swam first in the relay, but this was Lezak’s race to shine).
One for two isn’t bad for Tebow, right? Al-
though he did have the unfortunate luck of run-
ning into a camera crew from TMZ.com, the social 
gossip site, that quizzed him about his relation-ship prospects upon landing in Los Angeles.
You can’t have it all. Unless, of course, it’s your

PHILADELPHIA — Pedro 
Martinez promised to put on 
quite a show when he returns to the majors with the Philadelphia Phillies.
The NL East leaders are hop-
ing it will be a vintage perfor-mance.
Martinez finalized a $1 mil-
lion, one-year contract with the Phillies on Wednesday, and can earn up to $1.5 million in incen-tives. The three-time Cy Young Award winner hasn’t pitched 
since last season and won only 
eight games in 25 starts over his final two seasons with the Mets.
“I might surprise you, I might 
not,” Martinez said. “It’s going to be really fun to go find out.”
The Phillies are hoping Mar-
tinez has enough left to help them repeat as World Series 
champions. His dominating 20-
win, 200-strikeout seasons are well behind him, but a healthy Martinez could provide a boost to a starting rotation that has been hit hard by injuries.
“I don’t expect to be the same 
Pedro that I was when I was 26,” the 37-year-old right-hander 
said. “There’s a lot of innings 
I’ve pitched since then. It’s not the same, but I still feel like I can still bring something to the table.”
Martinez will need at least a 
few starts in the minors before he’s ready to join Philadelphia’s depleted rotation. The eight-time 
All-Star was placed on the 15-
day disabled list with a shoulder strain but will be with the Phil-lies for their four-game series in Florida beginning Thursday.
General manager Ruben Am-
aro Jr. said he could pitch in the majors in two to three weeks.
“Of course there’s some risk 
here,” Amaro said. “But we’d rather risk it on someone of his caliber and who knows how to win.”
The risk stems from Marti-
nez’s age, his 2,700-plus career innings and the three consecu-tive injury-riddled seasons that derailed his career in New York. He made frequent trips home to the Dominican Republic last year to visit his dying father, an 
emotional burden he couldn’t 
shed once he got the ballpark.
“The last few years have 
been horrible,” Martinez said. “I’m not saying horrible because of the results. I haven’t felt the way I wanted to feel. I wasn’t the same Pedro you were accus-tomed to seeing.”The free agent pitched in the 
World Baseball Classic before this season. He went 5-6 with a 5.61 ERA for the Mets last year, and won only 32 games for them over the life of a $53-million, four-year contract.
“I think I was too brave some-
times, or stupid sometimes, for 
pitching not in the regular health 
that you should have been in,” Martinez said. “Being a veteran, you should know that. Some-times your desire, your inner thoughts about competing and the way you feel about compet-ing, drags you to do sometimes things that you shouldn’t do.”THURSDAY, JULY 16, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 31

lievable year she had. 
GEMMA SPOff OrTH, S WIMMING  
AND DIv ING: Spofforth won two 
individual national titles — her 
second straight 100 back and third 
straight 200 back — at the 2009 
NCAA Swimming and Diving 
Championships. The junior was the 
SEC Female Swimmer of the Year, and her two NCAA titles were the 
99th and 100th in UF history. The 
fact that she won two national championships made her worthy 
of the list, but she received far less attention and a much smaller spot-
light despite being so successful.
KELSEY BruDEr, SO fTBALL: Brud-
er’s numbers were comparable to 
those of Francesca Enea, who was our No. 7 athlete of the year, and 
that’s no small accomplishment. 
Bruder stepped into the right-field 
position left open by former Gator 
Mary Ratliff and had an outstand-ing year, finishing with 68 RBI, 16 
home runs and a .713 slugging per-centage. 
AjA PACuLBA , SOfTBALL : With Kim 
Waleszonia injured for most of the 
season, Paculba’s early season 
move to leadoff batter became even 
more important. The sophomore 
set the single-season steals record 
with 27, hit .368, had an impressive .603 slugging percentage and a .492 
on-base percentage, just two points 
behind Enea’s team-leading .494.
MEGAN KErNS, SOCCEr: Perhaps 
embarrassingly, no soccer player 
even made it on our preliminary 
list despite the team finishing the 
year ranked in the top 10. 
In 2008, Kerns was named to the 
All-SEC First Team for leading 
the Gators in goals (13) and tying 
for the lead in assists (9) to total 35 
points while leading UF to a 19-4-1 
record, including a perfect 11-0 in 
the SEC.jErEMY CrISCIONE, Cr OSS CO uN-
TrY: In a sport all about concentra-
tion and dedication, Criscione was 
the definition of both. Quiet by na-ture, Criscione didn’t flaunt his ac-
complishments, but after qualify-ing for the NCAA Championships 
as an individual, the All-American 
finished 20th in his final meet at UF 
to cap off his career. 
COrEY HArTuNG, G YMNASTICS: As 
the only senior on the UF gymnas-
tics team this year, Hartung helped 
lead the Gators to a Super Six ap-
pearance despite several key inju-
ries and an otherwise young team.
   BILLY HOrSCHEL , GOL f: Horschel’s 
final season as a Gator was an ap-
propriate ending to an outstand-
ing career. As a senior, he picked up numerous accolades: his third 
PING All-America First-Team honor, the SEC Golfer of the Year 
and a unanimous First-Team All-SEC selection. 
CALvIN SMITH, Tr ACK AND fIELD:  
Smith had an impressive all-
around year for the No. 3 men’s track and field team, but he shined 
the brightest at the SEC Outdoor 
Championships. The 2009 SEC 
Outdoor Men’s Runner of the Year 
captured the Commissioner’s Tro-
phy by finishing first in the 400m, 
second in the 200m and being a 
part of the first-place 4x100 team, 
which held the fastest time in the 
nation.
So there you have it — 10 ath-
letes whose individual accomplish-
ments were so impressive that they 
deserved to be recognized, even 
if they weren’t able to squeeze in to our top 10. And the argument 
could even be made that this list is 
incomplete, that even a top 20 list 
doesn’t do every athlete justice.
I wonder if Letterman has that 
many quality jokes left over every 
night.ADAM , from page 28Pedro signs with Phillies32, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 16, 2009
