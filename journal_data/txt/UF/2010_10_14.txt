Gators looking for something to do on their day off this 
Friday have plenty of options.
This year’s Homecoming theme, “Celebration of The 
Gator Nation,” commemorates the university’s accomplish-
ments in academics and athletics.
“The theme is supposed to encompass everyone involved 
with The Gator Nation, including students, the football team, alumni and even future students,”said Gracie Faulk-enberry, the associate general chair of communications for Homecoming 2010. “It’s supposed to connect The Gator Na-tion.”
Florida Blue Key, a leadership honorary organization at UF, organizes and funds Homecoming and Gator Growl, the largest student-run pep rally in the nation.
Since kicking off on Sept. 27, the celebration has included 
a pageant, an education celebration recognizing contribu-tions made by professors and undergraduate research men-
tors, a concert and Soulfest, a multicultural extravaganza 
showcasing performances from student 
organizations.
Gator Gallop, a two-mile fun run that 
escorts the Homecoming Parade, is the 
first event on Friday. The route starts at the Percy Beard Track at James G. Pressly Stadium, runs along University Avenue, and ends near Southwest 13th Street. University Avenue will be blocked off from the President’s House to 
Main Street an hour before Gator Gallop and until the pa-
rade ends. The race will start at 11:30 a.m.The 87th annual Homecoming Parade will follow the 
run at noon on University Avenue between Gale Lemerand 
Drive and Main Street. More than 100,000 spectators are ex-
pected to attend, according to Dara Schopp, the Homecom-ing director of public relations.
The parade will be led by former Gator and Olympic 
gold medalist Steve Mesler, who will serve as grand mar -
shal, and will feature floats made by student organizations, local businesses, and UF cheerleaders and football players. 
“The parade is one of those events that really show-
cases UF’s tradition and spirit,” Schopp said. “It 
gives you a sense of what being a Gator is all about.”  
On Saturday afternoon, visitors can tailgate at the Stephen 
C. O’Connell Center starting at 4:30 p.m. at the Game Day BBQ & Alumni Celebration. There is no charge for admis-sion, but meal tickets cost $10. 
“Little kids are welcome. Alumni are welcome,” Schopp 
said. “It’s really an event for everyone.”
Teen crashes into driver license center after passing driving test
BRIDGEVILLE, Pa. (AP) — A teenager 
who just passed his driving test crashed 
into a state driver license center in western Pennsylvania. 
The accident happened Wednesday af-
ternoon as the teen was trying to leave the parking lot of a driver license center in the Pittsburgh suburb of Bridgeville.
Officials said at least three people were 
injured, but their injuries were not consid -
ered serious.Township police Sgt. Brian Halbleib told 
the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that the ac-cident happened when the teen pulled into the parking lot of the driver license center to drop off the man who had administered the test.
Halbleib said the teen thought the car 
was in park.
 It wasn’t.

Jen Ambrose Cotter uses 
her blog, “Bipartisan Vic-
tory Garden,” to bring atten-tion to Cabot-Koppers, the wood-treatment facility that 
has been listed by the federal 
government as a contaminat-ed Superfund site for more than 25 years.  
She researches the 90-acre 
piece of toxic land and how the Environmental Protection Agency plans to clean up the 
site.
“I have not been so angry 
and outraged in years,” Cot-
ter said. “I had to strip this 
beast called Koppers down to 
its bones to understand how this could have happened, and how it could be trans-
formed.”
But the clock is ticking 
for Cotter and others poring 
over the EPA’s plan. 
Friday is the last day al-lowed for public comment on the plan. 
After that, “it won’t go 
on record, which means they won’t be accountable for tak-ing you seriously,” said Cot-ter.
With her blog, www.bvg.
cotterindustries.com, Cot-ter aims to educate and gain 
enough influence with peo-
ple to “take on any federal agency.”
To make public comment 
on the EPA plan, Protect Gainesville’s Citizens Inc. encourages visiting www.protectgainesville.org or e-mailing EPA Project Manager 
Scott Miller directly at miller.

UF graduate Victor Martinez, right, speaks about Hispanic student issues 
while UF Student Body Treasurer Virlany Taboada listens.
� HE WAS PULLED OVER FOR 
A TRAFFIC VIOLATION AND SWALLOWED THE MARIJUANA.
By EMILY FUGGETTA
Alligator Staff Writer
efuggetta@alligator.org
A Gainesville man chewed 
himself into a hole Tuesday 
when, instead of stopping right 
away for police, he drove two blocks while swallowing a stash 
of marijuana.
Amos Moye, 22, was pulled 
over on East University Avenue shortly after 11 p.m. when officer Jeremiah Kelly noticed Moye had made an improper right turn and 
his license plate was obstructed, 
according to a Gainesville Police report. 
Kelly smelled marijuana and 
noticed bits of a “green, leafy substance” in the man’s teeth. Moye was charged with pos-session, fleeing, driving with a 
suspended or revoked license, 
and  –  because he swallowed the marijuana – tampering with evi-
dence.
Cpl. Tschar -
na Senn, spokeswoman 
for GPD, said it’s not irregular for people to swallow marijuana 
or crack cocaine in an attempt to 
hide the drugs from police. “It doesn’t happen every day,” 
she said, “but it’s pretty com-mon.”
Swallowing drugs isn’t wise 
– tampering with evidence is a felony, whereas in some quanti-ties, possession of marijuana is a misdemeanor.
“They might think they’re get-
ting away with it, but officers are trained to be observant,” Senn said. “We’re watching a lot of things people don’t know we’re watching.”
On top of the charges, Moye 
most likely wasted his stash. 
According to professor Mar -
garet James, chair of UF’s me-dicinal chemistry program, Moye probably wouldn’t have gotten 
the drug’s full effect from swal-
lowing it.
“It depends on how much he 
had,” James said, “but generally 
it wouldn’t be quite as potent as 
smoking it.”Police arrest man with marijuana stuck in teeth

UF’s Hispanic students emphasized the need for 
organizational unity within their diverse commu-
nity during an informal discussion at the Institute of Hispanic-Latino Cultures Wednesday night. 
About 25 student leaders and members of cul-
tural organizations on campus discussed problems faced by UF’s Hispanic community —  such as a lack of Hispanic student leaders and mentors — and suggested practical solutions for these issues. 
The event was hosted by Lambda Theta Phi 
Latin Fraternity Inc. as a part of Hispanic Heritage Month and featured a panel of student and univer -
sity leaders, including current Student Body Trea-surer Virlany Taboada; Jose Hernandez, the presi-
dent of the Dominican Student Association; and 
Victor Martinez, a 2009 UF alumnus who works in the New Student and Family Programs Office.
“One of the things that the Hispanic community 
lacks is structure,” Martinez said.
He said if Hispanic student groups were more 
organized and had more members who advocate their interests, more students would join. At the same time, participants in the discussion 
emphasized that the members of different Hispanic student organizations need to unite in order to bet-ter represent the Hispanic community. 
Lidice Ferrera, executive director of Hispanic 
Heritage Month, said organizations should reach out to smaller Hispanic student groups just as they reach out to non-Hispanic organizations.
“In the end, we should still have a time to come 
together,” Ferrera said. 
Participants in the discussion emphasized that 
Hispanic students can solve the problems within their community by seeking leadership positions outside of the community, not just within it.
David Rowe, a member of Sigma Lambda Beta 
International Fraternity Inc., said students can re-cruit other students to get involved.  
After the discussion came to an end, the stu-
dents planned to invite other organizational lead-
ers to a follow-up discussion next Wednesday, 
while Ricardo Marenco, the president of Lambda 
Theta Phi, stressed that an organization is about 
more than meetings and events.
“It’s about preparing Hispanics for the real 
world,” Marenco said.Hispanic students brainstorm ways to unite as communityAroundGainesville4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, OCTOBER 14, 2010

HOMECOMING NEWS� UF IS COMPETING AGAINST 31 
OTHER SCHOOLS FOR THE TITLE OF MOST VEGAN FRIENDLY.
By JERRY BRUNO
Alligator Contributing Writer
After months of deliberation, UF has been 
nominated as one of the most vegan-friendly 
colleges in the U.S. 
The nomination was based on both the 
quality and quantity of vegan options avail-
able to students on campus.
It also took into account feedback from 
students on the receptiveness and creativity 
of dining staff. 
Anyone can vote online at features.peta2.
com/VeganColleges2010/ to get UF to the 
top spot. The first round of voting ends Mon-day. 
There are three categories of schools: 
large schools, small schools and Canadian schools. 
UF is competing against 31 large schools for peta2’s title of most vegan-friendly school. 
Peta2 is the largest youth animal rights 
group in the world.  
Winners will be announced Nov. 19. Being a vegan is a lifestyle choice, said 
Anandani Maharaj, president of Animal Ac-tivists of Alachua County. 
“If you do it right, you will feel cleaner 
inside,” she said. 
There is also a group of students cam-
paigning for vegan dining options on campus 
such as Meat-Free Mondays. 
Winning the award would be 
one of many accolades that sets UF apart from the rest, said Jill 
Rodriguez, district market manager of Gator Dining Services. 
“The recognition for our dining program 
impacts not only our students and faculty/
staff, but our local partners as well,” Rodri-
guez said. “Both the Fresh Food Company and Gator Corner Dining Center offer a full-service vegan station that regularly features local vendors like Artie’s Tempeh.” UF fights for top vegan title

Spectators at Friday’s homecom-
ing parade will notice new recycling 
bins along the parade route. 
For the first time, the City of Gainesville Solid Waste Division 
will place recycling bins for paper 
items alongside bins for trash, bot-tles and cans, which have been in place for the last two years.
According to recycling program-
mer Joan Rollen, the paper recycling bins are a result of the growing trash problem on game days and during 
homecoming events, especially the 
amount of fliers and paper thrown on the ground instead of in trash bins.
“There are so many people out 
there at the parade,” Rollen said. “It’s a tight situation and it’s just something everyone has done.” 
Two hundred and fifty combined 
containers for recycling items and garbage will be placed alongside University Avenue and various side streets leading into campus. 
According to Rollen, cleanup 
takes approximately 2 1/2 to four hours to complete after an event. 
She hopes the additional recycling 
and trash containers will encourage people to properly dispose of their trash.
“You don’t think trash on the 
ground is expensive, but someone has to clean it up,” she said.Recycling bins to line homecoming parade routeOnCampu sTHURSDAY, OCTOBER 14, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Students for a Democratic Soci-
ety is rallying today in support of 
fair wages for Immokalee workers at the grand opening of the new Publix Supermarket in Millhopper 
Plaza.
SDS organizer Dave Schneider 
said 10 to 15 people will be out-
side the store at 8 a.m. for the of-ficial opening. A second rally will take place at 5:30 p.m., where rep-resentatives from the Coalition of Immokalee Workers will be with the Student/Farmworker Alliance, 
an independent student group that 
works to support farm workers na-tionally.
“This is a great time to bring this 
issue to the table,” Schneider said. 
Schneider said the groups are 
aiming to put pressure on Publix in order to get a fair wage contract signed.
In the spring, the Coalition of 
Immokalee Workers campaigned successfully to persuade Aramark, UF’s food provider, to pay workers 
an extra penny per pound of toma-
toes picked, in addition to estab-lishing explicit human rights and anti-slavery provisions.
“It was a really exciting experi-
ence,” said Schneider, who par -
ticipated in the movement in the spring.

with what we can do with the com-munity.”Students to protest

Jared Chasse, 12, wants to be an oceanographer 
when he grows up, and the City of Gainesville is 
offering to help pay for him to reach that goal. 
Jared, classified by the state as being an “at-
risk” youth, is one of seven lucky seventh-grad-
ers in Alachua County who will receive full two-
year scholarships to college thanks to the Take Stock in Children program and the city. 
The scholarships were awarded at a ceremo-
ny at Westwood Middle School on Tuesday eve-
ning. 
The students must graduate, maintain a 2.5 
GPA, remain drug- and crime-free, and meet 
with an appointed mentor once a week to reap 
their rewards.
“The whole idea behind this program is to 
help break the cycle of poverty,” said Rick Mul-
ligan, executive director of the Alachua County Public School Foundation.
This is the first year the city has contributed 
directly to the state-run Take Stock in Children program, which has been awarding promising and underprivileged children with scholarships 
since 1996.
As part of the new Gainesville Enrichment 
Mentoring program, the city has put forward 
$45,000 toward scholarships, so more children 
may benefit.
“We plan to continue into the future and plan 
to seek funding sufficient enough for more stu-
dents,” said Cecil Howard, director of Gaines-ville’s Office of Equal Opportunity. “If we could 
get funding for 100, that wouldn’t be too many to me.”
Jared’s mom, Julia Chasse, 
agrees. 
She moved to Gainesville from New York 
with her husband and two of her three children about three years ago.
She said she was “awestruck” to find Florida 
had such a program and “pleasantly surprised” that her son was chosen. 
“I think all states should adopt something 
like this,” she said. “I’m very proud and very lucky.”City gives scholarships to kids

The Seattle coffee bean 
powerhouse Starbucks is-sued new guidelines in U.S. and Canadian stores, saying 
baristas should work on no

That infuriatingly annoy-

In one of the fast-food 
realm’s notoriously longest lines, lines are going to get even longer as agitated caf-feine-deprived junkies wait even more impatiently for their names to be misspelled on their coffee cups. 
Starbucks said the change

This, of course, is coming

Columnist discusses UF ‘mediocrity’
Let’s have a big round of applause for mediocrity, 
UF’s new area of excellence. After watching Satur -
day’s game, I was struck with a dilemma: Where 
will I now derive my pride in my choice of higher learn-ing?
After Steve Addazio and the Gators successfully com-
pleted eroding my confidence in the football program 
Saturday night, I tried to find an area where UF stands 
high above the rest. Little did I realize at the time what an endeavor this would be.
Academic distinction certainly isn’t our forte. Though 
being accepted to UF was a considerable personal victory 
for me, it seems like every other person I talk to used UF as 
their safety school for the hoity-toity private institutions that churn out lawyers, doctors and politicians faster than midtown churns out drunk fratboys on a Thursday night. 
While we may have cutting edge research and develop-
ment programs in medicine and all kinds of engineering, we never seem to rise above the glass ceiling that exists for us as a public school — at least, if we do, we don’t get enough credit for it.
So, if we seem to be lacking in the standings in aca-
demia, certainly we can conversely win some recognition in the party school category.
Apparently not, as Georgia dominates the Princeton 
Review’s Party rankings, and we’re-WHAT?! We’re sev-enth!? How is this possible? I was assured by my father, who attended this fine institution based solely on its party school status, that I would be getting lots of flak for attend-ing such a wild school. Now it would appear that even 
the most tenuous means of distinguishing ourselves from 
the gray sea of universities is beyond our scaly grasp.
But, perhaps, this opens the door to even more ridicu-lous attempts at uniqueness.
A couple weeks ago I was intro-
ducing myself to a girl from JMU. 
What is JMU you may ask? I had to 
feel bad because I didn’t know it was James Madison Uni-
versity. What was more disturbing was the blank look I go from her when I explained I went to UF. I actually had 
to give our prestigious university’s full name. What kind 
of school do we go to when just giving the initials isn’t enough?
Maybe next time when I introduce UF and I get yet 
another blank stare, I’ll throw in that we graduated the 
fine individual that coined the phrase that is used nation-
wide as a protest against law enforcement’s use of electric shock deterrence.
Even better, I could appeal to those in the hate-fueled 
Internet community by referencing the former Alligator columnist/law school student/public office candidate who recently shot to reddit.com fame in what can only be called a blunder of biblical proportions. By the way Bryguy, thanks for opening up the previously crowded 
column race and for reinforcing the tremendous faith I 
already had in political candidates. 
So where do we get recognition, Gators? If I was some-
one who based my self-value solely on the school I went 
to, I would already be waste-deep in Häagen-Dazs car -
tons.
Maybe mediocrity itself is a worthy aspiration. Perhaps 
being content with being in the middle of the pack is the 
sort of fulfillment through uniformity that Marx dreamed 
of. I hope so because, at this point, it’s either that or vol-
leyball. Wait, is there a difference?

for Democrats
 
Fearing for their livelihoods in November’s election, the 
Dems are rolling out the big guns.
Those big guns belong to one exercising, anti-fat-
kid, blue-state-of-mind Mrs. Michelle Obama. 
For the party likely to get whiplashed in a typical, predict-
able, angry-at-incumbent overhaul, cash floods and political ads just don’t cut it anymore.
They need the First Lady’s which-way-is-the-beach? bi-
ceps to intimidate the energized Republicans, hoping to re-gain their majority. 
Not many are surprised by Mrs. Obama’s “fired-up-and-
ready-to-go” attitude as she scores a favorable rating more than 10 points higher than her husband, who’s angered a few voters during his historic health care overhaul and attempts 
to pull himself from the financial quicksand the previous ad-
ministration left us in. 
When the going gets tough for the incumbents in office, 
staying away from the guy who you flocked to during your own election with a sense of inspiration not felt in decades, is a certainty. 
And while the First Lady is nothing new on the campaign 
trail, we’re glad to see Michelle Obama duke it out on the trail she’s notably avoided since 2008 when she campaigned for her husband’s historic and inspiring victory. 
While she’s at it, we’d really enjoy seeing more of Sasha, 
Malia and Bo on the stump. We haven’t seen a family we liked this much since the Brady Bunch.
And, the Dems need all the help they can get.

Bryan Griffin deserves forgiveness
Over the past couple of weeks I have gotten to know Bryan 
Griffin as a person and a friend. I know he would never inten-
tionally plagiarize. He’s passionate person about his beliefs. I’m sure this was nothing more than him admiring an article and trying to get the message to others. All it would’ve taken was a 
citation I’m sure was subordinately overlooked due to the pres-
sure of balancing activities and schoolwork with the column.  
“Don’t judge a book by its cover” rings true; People are fo-
cused on the negative aspect, so no one will ever see the posi-tives he brings into this world and campus. He is the president of the only non-hazing, non-sectarian, non-secret fraternity , a law student, and the list of his achievements goes on.  Normal-ly I wouldn’t defend someone like this, but I have faced similar criticism when people didn’t know my character and judged 
me harshly on one foolish mistake. I won’t let a minor mistake 
ruin a commendable individual’s reputation. It’s easy to judge quickly when you don’t know the good in someone’s heart.

“Life isn’t fair!” says the 15-year-old girl whose 
parents just told her she couldn’t go to a birthday party because of a bad grade. “Life 
isn’t fair!” says the college student who can’t go out with his friends because of a 10-page paper due the next day 
that he hasn’t started. “Life isn’t fair!” says the wife at 
home who has to take care of her two kids and work on a proposal for her job. Well I’ll tell you whose life isn’t fair: the life of an individual suffering from HIV/AIDS — especially one in a low-income state. 
These people have to live with HIV/AIDS on their 
shoulders. Some people have to carry even more of a burden if they are too ashamed to live with this disease in public. It’s like a big secret they want to keep bottled up 
in the darkest corner of their souls — something they are 
scared of sharing because they don’t know how things would change if it were public. Would friends still hang out with them? Would public ignorance cause people to avoid them? Would they enjoy daily activities? 
Another thing that is not fair about this comes from 
the financial aspect.  These families might have to spend about $1,000 a month for the medicine to help HIV/AIDS. Some families can’t afford this payment and get help from the AIDS Drug Assis-tance Program. There are some individuals who are on a waiting list for this program because of 
insufficient funds. That’s not fair. Why should these in-dividuals have to wait for some medicines that can save their lives?
That leads me to my next point. Those people suf-
fering from HIV/AIDS have to live not knowing how much longer they have. It’s really a sad thing. Think about all those kids in other countries who do not have the money to buy another couple years of life. 
With that comes the point of me writing this column: 
to inform you healthy college students that life is fair, and there are bigger things in life than missing the big-gest party of the year. I write this to inform you about the struggles of those with HIV/AIDS. Go out there and 
learn more. Read up on some basics about the disease. 
Join clubs on campus to inform others. Spread the word. Help raise money . Help teach others how to prevent HIV/AIDS. Do whatever you can to help others realize that the lives of others living with HIV/AIDS is not fair.

The flagship team of UF’s ath-
letic program may be slipping, but 
across the street in the O’Connell Center, another squad has reached the pinnacle of its sport.
The Florida volleyball team is  
No. 1 in the latest AVCA rankings. It’s the first time the Gators have been ranked as the best team in the country since Dec. 3, 1996.
“It’s so cool,” senior middle-
blocker Lauren Bledsoe said. “I haven’t had the chance to be ranked No. 1 since I’ve been here 
at Florida.”
The Gators (14-1, 7-0 Southeast-
ern Conference) are 8-1 against 
ranked opponents this season. They were also ranked first in the RPI poll for the second consecutive week and have arguably the tough-est schedule in the nation. UF’s only loss came Sept. 10 against then-No. 
1, now-No. 9 Penn State.
Despite being excited about sit-
ting atop the rankings, Bledsoe un-
derstands there is still a lot of vol-leyball left to be played. 
“No one is at their best right 
now,” she said. “We still have a lot of things to get better on and a lot of things to perfect. I don’t think 
there’s any point where you’re 
good enough.”
Just past halfway through the 
regular season, the Gators are on top of the SEC standings by only one game. Defending champion No. 12 LSU is right behind them.
“This team understands in terms 
of where we are today isn’t where 
we want to be in the end,” coach 
Mary Wise said. “The goal hasn’t changed in trying to play our best volleyball at the end of the season. 
“Complacency certainly hasn’t 
been a part of this team, nor will we let it. I don’t think Callie Rivers will let it.”Wise said the team’s leader -
ship, provided by seniors like Riv-ers, Bledsoe and Erin Fleming, has been the key for UF. And the vet-eran presence doesn’t end there, as nine of the 14 Gators to see action this season are upperclassmen. 
“We benefit now because we are 
an experienced team,” Wise said. “Two years ago, when we were 
starting so many freshmen, it was 
really hard to draw parallels and raise expectations. Now we’re ju-niors and seniors. 
“You hope every year that the 
seniors can bring their sense of 
urgency and that they can instill 
that on the younger players. That’s what’s happening with this 2010 class.”
Another reason for the Gators’ 
success this season is the team’s chemistry. With every player on the team knowing their role, UF is doing everything it can to improve 
for December, when games matter 
most. 
“There are players who don’t 
get much attention because they don’t get a lot of playing time,” Wise said. 
These individuals make the best 
of it during intrasquad scrimmag-es, preparing the Gators for any-thing that comes their way. 
“I’ve got to tell you, we’ve got 
one of the best scout teams going,” 
Wise said.8, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, OCTOBER 14, 2010

SOUND-OFF
By BENJAMIN EVANS
avenue contributing writer
The cast and crew of the Hippodrome State 
Theatre’s “Dracula” stop for a ten-minute break 
from rehearsal after running through the show’s first act. Some go straight for their lighters, some 
for a drink, and Van Helsing, played by Eric Men-
denhall, tests the sharpness of a stake he wields in the second act.
In the back of the theater, Dracula sits eating 
a sandwich.
Played by Justin Sease, the actor switches 
from an all-blood diet to a homemade lunch. It’s something packed with protein — after all, Dracu -
la is shirtless in this production.
“I’m trying to gain muscle for the role,” he 
said.Sease moved from New York City to Gainesville 
near the end of September to start rehearsing for the part he landed with an audition video sent to the play’s director, Lauren Caldwell.
Although a move to a small city like Gainesville 
might make some “I heart NY” T-shirt-wearing, big city folks nauseous, Sease said he has en-joyed the transition. For someone who grew up Harrisonburg, Va., a town with a population of about 44,000, the move to a smaller city has 
been more like a return home.
“It’s comforting in a way,” said Sease, who 
appreciates the small things you get out of small 
towns, like the smiles and greetings on the street.
He’s gotten to know the cast better over drinks 
and jokes during rehearsal, but he said the play is really what has connected them.“We all have a common goal — to make the 
show as good as it can be,” he said. 
After the rehearsal break, the cast and crew 
go back to working out the kinks of the produc-tion. The actors try to get scriptwriter Mac Well-
man’s dialogue down while the lighting designer 
gets used to the new equipment. 
“I love our new light board!” he said. “Oh God, shut up,” Caldwell said. As the director, Caldwell switches seats peri-
odically to get different views of the performance, standing when the play comes to an especially in-tense part. She keeps quiet, except for the occa-sional laugh or to sing along to one of the songs 
playing in the background of the show.
The actors weave their way in and out of the 
blood-red metal, two-story set that looks like a 
mammoth elementary school jungle gym, ex-cept, of course, for the IV bags filled with blood wrapped around the dingy bars.

aveFall for fashion: swear off your sweats 
  By DANA BURKE
 avenue contributing writer
 You said sayonara to summer months ago, but now 
that Mother Nature’s ﬁ  nally catching up, it’s time to of-
ﬁ  cially part ways.
  In other words: Lose the shorts.
  But when it comes to fall fashion, don’t settle for 
sweatpants and jeans. Step up your style with one of these alternatives.
1. The Cargo Pant  I’m not talking about your little brother’s cargos 
from Old Navy. This fall’s trend is the skinny cargo, a 
redesign of the classic big-pocket style featuring a slim-
mer, sleeker frame. With a loose-ﬁ  tting, neutral-colored tee, this look is as simple as jeans and a Gators shirt — without actually being jeans and a Gators shirt. 
2. The Tailored Pant  Back to business: Tailored trousers aren’t just for 
the ofﬁ  ce. Always a popular look on the runway, there is nothing more empowering in fashion than menswear 
for women, so take this style to the street paired with 
Dana Burke / Alligator
Sophomore Alyssa Oreﬁ  ce pairs tights and knee-
high socks with boots and a cardigan. 
your favorite oxfords and a lace top for a feminine 
touch.
 3. Tights
  Not ready to retire your favorite skirts and sum-
mer dresses to the back of your closet? You can have the best of both seasons with a pair of tights. 
The best part: Tights come in a bunch of different 
colors and styles, so you can play up your look with a bold pattern, or opt for a classic, solid look.
 4. Leggings
  Not just for the gym, leggings are a way to cov-
er up your legs without covering up your curves. 
Topped with a tunic or an oversized knit sweater, leggings are perfect for both comfort and style. 
Just be wary of the ultimate fashion faux pas: Leg-
gings are not pants, so make sure your top covers your assets, if you catch my drift.
 5. Thigh-High Socks
  Think Britney Spears in her “…Baby One More 
Time” music video, minus the revealing schoolgirl 
outﬁ  t.
Pair your above-the-knee socks with boots for 
the ultimate fashion statement and warmth. “The whole experience is a challenge,” said 
Jennifer Smith, a theater senior at UF, who is one of the three dancing vampyrettes. “You 
have a jungle gym for adults.”
But the challenge is worth it: “It’s going to 
be raining blood — literally,” she said.
The modern set brings familiar characters 
into an alternate world that’s cold, bleak and perfect for a play about vampires.
“It’s hard to not let this set upstage you,” 
said Nichole Hamilton, who plays Lucy in the 
show.And then there are the physical demands 
of the set.
 Not only do actors walk off the stage with 
bruises, but because of the openness of the 
bars, the cast has to be more discreet and in-
character with the blood capsules they pop in mouths for the fang-tastic effect.
But Caldwell believes the downfalls are 
worth it for the visuals.
“You could almost turn off the dialogue and 
see the show,” she said. “The words are sort of the icing on the cake.”
But that doesn’t mean 
the dialogue should be ig-nored. Wellman’s script is sharp and rich, with lines that would make “Twilight” 
star Kristen Stewart’s head 
explode.
“[Writer] Mac Wellman 
deals in textures and images,” Caldwell said. “[Dracula] is a good nod to Mac Wellman. I 
mean, you hear the language.”
And in the midst of a pop culture-fueled 
fascination with all things undead, it’s the per-
fect blood bath.
The show runs until Nov. 7. For times and 
ticket information, visit www.thehipp.org.
SIDE BAR: Interview with a vampire
“Dracula” star Justin Sease sounds off.
▪ If you were a real vampire, whose blood 
would you drink ﬁ  rst?
“It’s a tie between Scarlett Johansson 
and Rachel McAdams. I just think those are the hottest women in Hollywood.”▪ Are you a day person or night person?
“I know I’m not a morning person. I can’t 
even function until I have a cup of cof-
fee.” ▪ Team Edward or Team Jacob?
“I am my own team!” Dear Jared,
  I’m in a long-distance relation-
ship with the guy I’ve been dating 
for the past three years. We both 
decided it was cool to hook up with other people as long as we were open about it. Didn’t think it would be a big deal until he 
actually slept with another girl, 
and now I just feel like crap about it. Am I a total hypocrite if I break up with him over it? Or should I 
give this whole relationship thing 
another whirl?
 Sincerely,  Open for Business
 To start, maybe you should be 
closed for business. Perhaps you both should realize you 
probably aren’t the best for each other if you’re open to someone else dou-ble-dipping his tortilla 
chip in your 
once-off-limits brand of queso 
salsa. 
  It sounds 
to me things 
are probably on their way out any-
way, so give the relationship thing 
another whirl. But with a different 
guy.
And this time, how about we 
try someone where swing dancing 
isn’t an option.
  And when I say “dancing,” I 
mean “humping.” 
  And besides, no one likes slop-
py seconds of day-old salsa.My long-distance dudsex and the swamp 

 Who Owns My Heart
 Miley Cyrus is at it again with a new 
music video for her single “Who Owns 
My Heart.” Spoiler alert: It’s inappropriate! 
Surprising, right? Not so much. Ever since her scandalous 
Vanity Fair photo shoot in April 2008 and controversial 
pole-dancing stint at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards, it 
seems the 17-year-old isn’t trying to pay penance for her 
grown-up behavior. From the start of the video  — with 
the bass pounding and the panty-clad teen writhing on 
a bed of rufﬂ  ed silk sheets — you just know she’s done it again. We miss Hannah Montana. Jackass 3D
 Some movies — ahem, “Step Up 
3D” — may have been better left 
untouched by Hollywood’s current 3-D mania. So how do we feel about a chance to get up close and personal with Johnny Knoxville and his 
crew. Imagine it: a Porta-Potty catapulted in the 
air, a Jet Ski ﬂ  ying off a ramp that’s too steep, a cedar tree collapsing as two cackling bodies soar in the air then crash to the ground. We wouldn’t want to miss such self-destructive genius. The Age of Adz
 Alternative singer-songwriter 
Sufjan Stevens continues to 
bare his soul on his sixth studio album. This 
time around, he’s trying his hand at Auto-Tune and relying more heavily on electronics than on 
strings. The LP, which includes 11 dream-like, 
choir-accompanied, horn- and sleigh bell-strewn tracks, comes just one week after the release of his EP “All Delighted People.” Savor these indie-rock gems. Key tracks: “Too Much” and “I Walked.” Freedom: A Novel
  A follow-up to 2001’s “The Cor-
rections,” Jonathan Franzen’s latest 
novel has all the makings of a modern 
classic: an internally afﬂ  icted, middle-class family dis-turbed by the 21st century’s political and social hurdles. 
Meet the Berglunds, said restless family. There’s Patty, 
who frequently questions her past decision to marry cur-rent husband Walter over his college roommate; Walter, a self-defeating businessman tempted by an affair with his young assistant; and Joey, Patty and Walter’s son, a cocky college graduate who sells vehicle parts to the military to use in Iraq. More importantly, this book received Oprah’s coveted stamp of approval. Enough said. Each Thursday, the Avenue is serving up the best in

clickreadBy Melinda Carstensen Dear Jared,
  I think I have a problem. I haven’t been 
with a girl in a while (we’re talking over a 
year), so I guess you can say I’ve taken this 
time to embrace my manhood. I masturbate all the time, twice a day minimum, and I’m worried it’s starting to consume my sex 
life. Sometimes I think about it when I work 
my schedule, and I’m not so sure if that’s healthy or normal. Am I weird? Creepy?
 Signed,
  One Man Show
 For one, I commend you on your one-
man-show attempt to kill all the kit-tens in the world. Doesn’t God kill, 
like, 17 for each time you get off? Con-gratulations, you’ve killed about Detroit’s population worth of felines since you had your last go at a girl. Bob Barker should be 
sending you a personal thank-you note any 
day for helping to end that whole pet over-population thing. 
  Secondly, how’s your hand? I’m worried 
you might be bruising tendons or inducing carpal tunnel with your Tasmanian Devil vigor. 
  Then again, I guess we can all be thank-
ful your forearm-building friction habit isn’t harmful to anyone (except for maybe your schlong’s skin) like, you know, unicycling? 
  Remember that book “Everyone 
Poops”? Remember when your elemen-tary school teacher used to read it to ev-eryone while we sat uncomfortably in a circle, trying not to think about our teacher 
pooping? 
  Well, the same notion stands tried and 
true for the should-be-published book “Ev-
eryone Gets Off.” 
  Everybody does it, and no one wants 
to envision his or her teacher doing it. Per-haps twice a day is a little excessive. Per-haps twice a day is borderline synonymous with the force of two sticks making ﬁ  re af-
ter rubbing them together for so long. 
  As long as your little one-man game 
of ﬁ  rst-to-ﬁ  nish-gets-to-do-it-again doesn’t 
interfere with your actual love life or be-comes your sole love life, then I salute you 
and your warm-apple-pie pursuits. 
  Just lie when someone comments on 
your unusually large, single-sided forearm. Do it yourself: self-love is still love

TEEING OFF WITH KYLE MAISTRI INSIDE POLL QUESTIONHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF guard Kenny Boynton worked on fixing his shooting motion in the offseason. He shot 29.4 percent 
from behind the three-point line in his freshman year.
 HE WILL NOT PLAY SATURDAY 
AGAINST MISSISSIPPI STATE.

Even though he returned to practice 
earlier this week, wide receiver Chris 
Rainey will not see action in games until he fulfills two obligations.
Coach Urban Meyer said the junior 
needs to spend an undisclosed amount of time performing community service and 
show he can refrain from making incen-
diary comments.
Rainey pled guilty to a misdemeanor 
stalking charge Sept. 27 after being ar -
rested for sending a threatening text mes-sage to a former girlfriend earlier in the 
month. 
Prior to the arrest, the receiver carried 
a reputation of stirring controversy dur -
ing interviews, most recently in August, when he said last year’s team featured a 
lot of “prima donnas.”   
“Chris has a history of opening his 
mouth and careless things coming out,” Meyer said. “Obviously, this is the first 
time [he has done] anything like [the text 
message]. … Chris is not a violent per -
son.”  
Meyer said he was in “constant com -
munication” with Florida president Ber -
nie Machen and athletic director Jeremy 
Foley as Rainey’s case proceeded.
Hill still struggling: Defensive coor -
dinator Teryl Austin said he is still not happy with free safety Will Hill’s perfor -
mance. 
Austin criticized Hill last week, say-
ing the junior was not playing to his 
potential. Hill responded with a season-high nine tackles against LSU, but Austin 
called his performance “average” after he 
whiffed on several open-field opportuni-ties.Rainey given stipulationsREcRUITInG

Florida’s offense has lacked a big-
play tight end this season. And now, its 
recruiting class might too.
According to some reports, Jack-
sonville University Christian four-star 
tight end A.C. Leonard decommitted 
from the Gators on Wednesday morn-
ing.
“I don’t have anything against Flori-
da or the coaches,” Leonard told Scout.com. “Matter of fact, they’re all great 
guys. I just don’t feel like that’s the best 
place for me.”
Ranked as the No. 4 tight end in 
the nation by Rivals.com, Leonard had 
been orally committed to Florida since 
Nov. 29. At the time, he was the sec-ond member of the Gators’ 2011 class, which had grown to 16 commits as of last week.Ten and a half months and two 
straight UF losses later, Leonard is re-opening his recruitment.
Following Florida’s loss to LSU on 
Saturday, Leonard softened his once-solid commitment. The tight end at-tended the game and left the stadium 
disappointed, saying the game was 
tough to watch.
The fact the offense 
has lacked output 
from the tight ends 
this season could have 
played a role in Leon-ard’s decision to shy away from UF. 
Since Aaron Her -
nandez left early for 
the NFL, no tight end has filled the void. Production at the position has dropped off since last season when Hernandez 
was first on the team in receptions (68) TE recruit backs off oral 
commitment to Gators

After a turbulent freshman sea-
son filled with numerous highs 
and lows, Kenny Boynton has reason to believe he’ll make major 
strides in his second year. 
Thanks to a new shooting mo-
tion, a few new faces at his posi-
tion, the team’s improved post offense and the experience of last 
year’s run to the NCAA Tourna-ment, Boynton should see a ma-
jor increase in his 29.4 three-point shooting percentage. 
“I think the shooting percent-
ages really were drastically low for both (Boynton and point guard Erving Walker),” coach Billy Don-
ovan said. 
In an effort to turn that number 
around, Boynton tried to form a 
more consistent stroke.
At times last season, the then-
freshman guard had issues keep-ing his lower body steady during 
his shot. 
He also struggled to keep his 
release point consistent, occasion-
ally letting go of the ball on the way down rather than at the high point of his jump. 
But now, Boynton believes all 
of those issues are behind him. 
After working with a coach who 
Donovan first met through former 
Gators guard Mike Miller, Boynton 
has switched up his release so that the ball leaves his hands farther 
out in front of his head, giving him 
control he had not previously felt. 
“Last year I never knew when 
it was going to go in, I was just 
shooting,” Boynton said. “Now I 
know when it’s off and how long 
it’s going, and I think it’s just a bet-
ter shot.”
Boynton said he is now consis-
tently taking the same stroke every time, whereas last year each shot 
felt different. 
This added stability figures to Boynton works with coach to fix shooting stroke 
 You got to hand it to the Rangers for celebrating with ginger ale instead of 
champagne out of respect for Josh Hamilton’s struggle with alcohol. Not only 
that, but the powdered sugar instead of cocaine was a classy touch out of re -
spect for manager Ron Washington. ... The media was abuzz with Gilbert Arenas faking an injury to let a teammate get more playing time in a preseason game. Could’ve been worse, he could’ve pulled a gun on a teammate ... oh... whoops. The UF women’s volleyball team is ranked 
No. 1 for the first time since 1996. But with 
just a one-game lead in the conference standings, the Gators don’t have much room for error. See Story, Page 8.“Now I know when it’s off 
and how long it’s going, 
and I think it’s just a better 
shot.”

Today’s question: Do you agree with 
Urban Meyer’s decision to bring back wide receiver Chris Rainey?
Vote on alligatorSports.orghelp not only the sophomore’s    out-
side shooting, but also his midrange 
game, which he says has improved 
during the offseason. 
“I feel like in workouts I’ve been 
knocking down my midrange shot a lot,” Boynton said. “That was defi-nitely a big thing I wanted to work 
at.”
The continued development of the 
team’s interior players is another fac-
tor expected to lead to better three-point shooting. 
If big men like Vernon Macklin, 
Erik Murphy and Patric Young can draw the attention of opposing de-fenses, it should generate more open looks for UF’s guards. 
“Being able to throw the ball in-
side and having some more scoring 
options can maybe relieve some of 
that pressure on those guys,” Dono-van said. 
An additional technique Dono-
van is using to lighten the load of the 
starting guards is to put solid players 
behind them. 
To this end, 
Florida brought in a 
pair of freshmen in guard Scottie Wil-
bekin and swing-
man Casey Prather, who are expected 
relieve Boynton and Walker, who tied 
for the team lead with 32.9 minutes played per game last season.
Another new face, Rutgers transfer 
Mike Rosario, has to sit out this sea-son but should help Boynton in prac-
tice. Rosario’s talent both offensively 
and defensively has forced Boynton 
to lift his game in workouts. 
But perhaps more than anything, 
Boynton will be aided by the expe-rience and wisdom he gained in his 
first year with the program. 
“I learned that you gotta put a 
lot of work into this,” Boynton said. “It’s not just going and taking shots. 
It’s watching film, it’s studying the guys that you’re playing against. It’s 
mentally going into the game and be-ing prepared, knowing that it’s more 
than just basketball.”THURSDAY, OCTOBER 14, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 19
and second in receiving yards (850) and touch-
downs (five).
However, University Christian School coach 
Heath Nivens said Leonard didn’t decommit from the Gators, insisting the four-star recruit is leaving his options — which include Nebraska, Alabama and Miami — open.
Leonard has taken official visits to Nebraska 
and Alabama this season, and Nivens said the 
tight end wants to take his time and use his three 
remaining official visits.
According to Nivens, Leonard just wants to 
make sure he made the right decision when he committed to Florida last year.
“He never used the word ‘decommit,’” Nivens 
said. “That word has been thrown around a lot [Wednesday]. UF is still a top school for him.”Coach: Leonard not 
decommitted from UF

Halapio, Demps probable for Saturday’s game
Most notably, Hill missed receiver Terrence Toliver on 
a 38-yard touchdown in the second quarter. After Toliver 
hauled in a slant pass, Hill misjudged his approach to the 
receiver and accidentally took out linebacker Brandon 
Hicks.
“When [Hill] goes to make contact, his head drops 
down,” Austin said of the play. “As a tackler, you don’t 
ever drop your head.”
Hill’s form is not usually that bad, Austin added.Injuries: Guard Jon Halapio (right middle finger) is 
probable for Saturday’s game against Mississippi State, Meyer said. Halapio underwent surgery earlier this week and should practice at full speed today.
Meyer said running back Jeff Demps 
(sprained foot) is feeling much better than he did last week, and he expects the junior to play Saturday. Demps dressed 
out against LSU but did not leave the 
sidelines.
He added that after being limited last 
week quarterback John Brantley (ribs, 
right thumb) has practiced at full speed 
this week. 
Freshman strong safety Matt Elam (concussion) has not 
been cleared to practice, safeties coach Chuck Heater said.FOOTBALL , from page 18

RECRUITING CLASS THIS YEAR.
By MATT WATTS
Alligator Writer
 
Since arriving on campus three years 
ago, coach Amanda Butler has made no 
secret of her expectations for the women’s 
basketball program: win a national cham-pionship.
With only two returning starters from 
last year’s team that finished 15-17, Butler 
and the Gators will have to rely heavily on 
newcomers and young players if they are to play in Indianapolis when March Mad-ness rolls around. 
“Our team knows how I feel about it 
and what my expectation is,” Butler said. “We don’t have goals that change every year. We’re trying to be the best — that’s what we’re trying to be every year and 
that’s not going to change.”
UF will feature six new players this 
season, including four freshmen from the 
nation’s No. 21 recruiting class and two ju-
nior college transfers. 
Butler is excited about the energy they 
have shown in practice thus far and said 
the team has a completely different vibe from a year ago.
“The freshmen have done a great job 
of acclimating themselves to our expecta-tions,” Butler said. “Their eagerness, just 
little sponges wanting to be coached and 
learn and figure out how to contribute to us winning a championship, has been very encouraging.”
Butler said some of the new players, 
especially the guards, will be mixed into the rotation early and often. Jordan Jones, whose 9.1 points per game is best among returning players, is the only holdover at 
guard. 
But what appeared to be a position of 
weakness is now a strength as Butler and her staff brought in four players who pro-
vide a different dynamic than what UF 
played with last season. 
Jones said last year’s guards were main-
ly shooters, but the newcomers provide a 
more all-around game featuring aggres-
sive defense and an ability to penetrate to 
the basket.
“It’s exciting,” Jones said. “This brand of basketball is going to be different than 
what people have seen in the last couple 
years for Florida. We’re going to play up 
and down. We’re going to put a lot of points on the board. We want people to hate playing against Florida.”
Gainesville native Jaterra Bonds and  
Jacksonville transfer Lanita Bartley are competing for the point guard position in 
practice and figure to make an impact in 
their first seasons.
“Lanita did a great job of coming right 
in and showing everyone that she was ca-pable of leading the team from the point guard position,” Butler said. “Her speed 
with the ball is really unmatched. She is a 
really, really intense competitor.”
2010 Miss Georgia Basketball recipi-
ent, Kayla Lewis, and Sacramento, Calif., standout Brittany Shine will provide even 
more depth at guard. Both were ranked in 
the top-100 overall prospects by ESPN’s HoopGurlz.
The experience of Jones, sophomore 
forward Jennifer George — an All-South-eastern Conference freshman last year — and the rest of the upperclassmen will be an integral part in leading a young team. 
But the freshmen are already on the 
same page as their coach.
Shine, Bonds, Lewis, Deaundra Young 
and redshirt freshman Lily Svete have donned themselves the “Futuristic Five” 
and share the same championship aspira-
tions as their head coach.
“That’s always been my dream, my 
goal,” Shine said. “I’ll do whatever it takes.”20, ALLIGATOR  THURSDAY, OCTOBER 14, 2010
