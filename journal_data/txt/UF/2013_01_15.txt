Joe Taranto was nervous. He had 
been expecting a call from the Dor-
itos legal department, not a prank call from “Transformers” director Mi-chael Bay.
Bay, who pretended to be a law-
yer from Doritos on the phone, broke the news to Taranto: Taranto’s video “Fetch” earned him a spot as a ﬁ  nalist in the Doritos Crash the Super Bowl contest.
“I didn’t sleep for a day or two,” 
Taranto said. “It was an amazing surprise. We already won. We’re happy.”
UF telecommunication graduates 
Joe Taranto, 31, and his 36-year-old brother, Vinnie Taranto, competed against thousands of entrants for one of the ﬁ  ve ﬁ  nal spots in the seventh annual contest. The competition in-vited consumers to make and send Doritos ads for a chance to be aired to a worldwide audience during the Su-per Bowl XLVII broadcast Feb. 3.
“He called me and told me, and 
we just laughed,” Vinnie Taranto said. “We were prepared, but we weren’t prepared for Michael Bay to prank us.”
Viewers can cast their vote on the

Smathers Library Bookstore will close Thurs-
day after 13 years of business.
The bookstore ofﬁ  cially announced its clos-
ing Monday with a sign posted outside Tur-
lington Plaza. The bookstore has about 2,500 items, which include books, mini paperbacks, CDs, DVDs, posters and comic books, that are on sale for 10 or 25 cents. The sale will last until Wednesday at 2:30 p.m.
Michelle Elneil, the bookstore’s gifts pro-
gram manager, said the bookstore was closing for library renovation.
“It’s sad, but we march on,” she said.Elneil said the bookstore’s items were mostly 
donations from faculty. She said she thinks the proﬁ  ts from the sales will go into a general li-brary fund. All books that are not sold or added to a collection in an existing library will most likely be donated to the Friends of the Library.
Psychology sophomore Shanique Yee and 
nutrition and pharmacy sophomore Jennifer Perez, both 19, have been cataloging books in the bookstore and helping customers since May 2012 and Fall 2011, respectively.
“It’s sad knowing that I’m not gonna come in 
and be around these books,” Perez said.
Yee said she’ll miss the bookstore’s regular 
customers.
“They always have funny stories,” she said.Yee and Perez said the store made 137 sales 
Monday, surpassing the average 20 customers a day.
“It was like a stampede,” Yee said.Contact Colleen Wright at cwright@alligator.

University Police is encouraging 
students to lock up their belongings 
after another burglary was reported at the Keys Residential Complex Sat-urday morning.
The burglary was the third re-
ported incident in the last month and half, as UPD continues its investiga-tion.The department has not arrested anyone in connection to the string of burglaries at the complex.
On Saturday, a Keys resident told 
ofﬁ  cers he woke up to someone inside his apartment, according to a UPD news release.
The resident told ofﬁ  cers the bur-
glar talked to him moments before running out of the room.
Although the resident could not 
give a complete description of the burglar, he said the thief spoke with “some sort of accent,” according to the release.
In the December Keys burglaries, 
police said the burglar — or group of burglars — mostly stole electronic de-vices, which include game consoles, cellphones and laptops, during early morning hours. Wallets were also re-ported stolen from rooms.
With the recent increase of bur-
glaries at Keys, UPD recommends students keep their dorm and apart-ment doors locked at all times and to keep all valuables out of common areas.
As an added security step, the 
department encourages students to enable password protection on their electronic devices to keep thieves from accessing them.
Students can also use software 
from Frontdoor Laptop Software, which can track and disable comput-ers in the event they’re stolen. The program can be downloaded for free on the company’s website, www.frontdoorsoftware.com.
UPD also suggest students regis-
ter their devices through the depart-ment’s website. UPD will keep the make, model, serial number and type of product registered online on ﬁ  le, which will make identifying and re-turning a recovered item easier.

nator for the Tolbert and Keys area, sent out an email to residents Satur- Keys burglary reported

The Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Ofﬁ  ce is investigating a Sunday 
night shooting in Archer that left one person dead and two others in the hospital.
Deputies have arrested Bran-
don Scott, 22, and charged him with one count of homicide and two counts of attempted homi-cide, said ASO spokesman Lt. Todd Kelly.
The incident started at about 7 
p.m. Sunday, when an argument broke out between Scott and Tim-othy Robinson, 34, at Robinson’s house on the 9800 block of South-west 162nd Terrace in Archer, ac-cording to an ASO news release.
The ﬁ  ght escalated when Scott 
grabbed a riﬂ  e and ﬁ  red at Rob-inson and two others, Wesley Boykin and Aja Newton. Scott ﬂ  ed from the house before depu-
ties responded 
to the scene.
At about 8 
p.m., ASO sent deputies to the house after re-ceiving 911 calls about the shoot-ing.
When deputies arrived, they 
found Boykin, 26, had been shot in the abdomen. Newton, 18, was hit in the arm as well as the abdo-men. An ambulance rushed both victims to Shands at UF for treat-ment.
Deputies later found Robin-
son’s body about 200 yards away from the scene, according to the release. Deputies said Robinson ﬂ  ed from the house after Scott shot him.
At 10:41 p.m., a deputy near the crime scene located and ar-rested Scott.
Deputies later booked Scott 
into the Alachua County Jail at 2:11 a.m. Monday.
Kelly said Boykin and New-
ton remained in critical care at the hospital Monday afternoon but could not provide further de-tails.
As of Monday night, Scott 
remained in custody without bond.

For UF electrical engineering alumnus 
Quinn Martin, starting a vegan coffee shop is 
a way to put his degree into practice.
“I think it’s pretty closely tied, because the 
way I approach coffee is very technical,” he said.
Martin, 23, is one of the business partners 
collaborating to jumpstart Radical Press Coffee Collective, which is set to open in March as one of Gainesville’s ﬁ  rst vegan coffee shops. 
It will take up space inside the Civic Media 
Center, 433 S. Main St. The shop is currently raising money online, and as of press time, it had raised $891 toward its goal of $15,000 on its Indiegogo page.
The coffee shop will give customers a 
chance to tailor their drinks with alternative milks, Martin said, such as soy, rice, almond or ﬂ  ax. 
The shop will also serve vegan baked 
goods.
“It’s kind of like customization,” he said. 
“It’s what makes every cup special.”
Martin, a self-professed “coffee geek,” said making coffee can be creative, but it also involves a technical process.
He said he’s been collecting and tweaking 
equipment, including French presses, to engineer specialty coffee for the shop.
Rusti Poulette, another coffee shop 
founder, said the center is already a meeting point for artists and activists to work on projects, and for friends to socialize and play board games.
The addition of the coffee shop and a 
lounge area, Poulette said, will help bring more people together.
“We’re hoping to be a social hub,” he 
said.
Kathy Whipple, store coordinator for the 
neighboring Citizens Co-op market, said the coffee shop will help showcase locally supplied fair-trade coffees — a label for consumers that indicate laborers were well-paid for their work. 
“We’re really looking forward to having 
the coffee collective around, because they’re going to be offering some of the coffee we sell in the co-op,” she said. “It will give people a place to sit and have a cup of coffee, and then they’ll come over here and go grocery shopping.”New vegan coffee shop raises money for scheduled March  openingLOCALScott

While at Harvard in 1998, Da-
vid Weinstein was being dissuad-
ed from working on a rare genetic disease that he would later dedi-cate his life to.
Weinstein is now a recipient 
of an award previously presented to Pope John Paul II and Nelson Mandela — the Order of the Smile award.
Recipients are nominated by 
children for their efforts in help-ing children. Hundreds of pa-tients suffering from glycogen storage disease nominated Wein-stein.
“The fact that the patients put 
so much effort into getting me recognized is truly invaluable,” he said.
The disease is a rare condition 
in which the body cannot prop-erly store sugar.
“This is really not about me,” 
Weinstein said. “It’s really about an effort to help a community that has been in need of help, and even today, many children in this country are dying.”
At UF, Weinstein directs the 
largest research program in the world for the disease.
“We take care of people from 
all 50 states — and 36 countries,” he said.
More than 425 patients from 
around the world have come to Gainesville for care.
“When I moved here to 
Gainesville in 2005, I wanted to create the Disney World of health care,” he said. “I wanted to create a place where people could get care, and where if people didn’t have any money, they wouldn’t have to worry about that.”
Weinstein first came to 
Gainesville to pursue his dream of gene therapy. He wanted to cure dogs in order to bring gene therapy to humans. 
UF’s veterinary school would 
allow Weinstein to accomplish this.
“There are dogs that naturally 
have this disease,” he said.
The disease has several differ -
ent forms and can lead to seizures, brain damage and death.
Cornstarch therapy has been 
used to treat the disease in chil-dren. 
However, each treatment has 
to be individualized for each child.
“Most children with GSD have 
to drink cornstarch,” he said. “They weigh it out like a medica-tion and use it to meet the energy needs of those who have excessive amounts of sugar in the liver.”
UF Glycogen Storage Disease 
Nurse Specialist Iris Ferrecchia had four children, three of whom suffered from the disease. The el-dest child of the four passed away as a toddler. 
Ferrecchia said she first met 
Weinstein when her youngest child was a patient in the pro-gram in Boston.
“No one else has cared,” she 
said.  “There are so many orphan diseases in the world. It’s nice that we have a champion.”
Not only is Weinstein working 
to help cure the disease, but he has also created a charity for his patients. 
The charity covers the costs for 
patients to travel to Gainesville for treatment. 
A critically ill child, Weinstein 
said, traveled to Gainesville af-ter being brought in by the U.S. Army in Afghanistan.
“We have brought in people 
from every continent except for Antarctica using the charity,” he said.
Weinstein also travels to coun-
tries to provide aid and training. He travels to Europe at least once a month.
“When I travel and I go back to 
these countries, and I see children doing well, it’s so rewarding,” he said.
Last year, Weinstein created a 
clinic in Brazil. This month, peo-ple will be arriving from Brazil, Germany and the Netherlands for training, Weinstein said.
He will travel to Poland in 
August to attend a knighting cer -
emony, where he will receive his Order of the Smile award. Some of his patients will be there to watch.
Even with all the traveling, 
Weinstein does not like to stay away from Gainesville for too long.
“There are so few doctors that 
we have a waiting list of over 18 months to get in here,” he said. “I try to never miss a workday.”
Scott Rivkees, the chairman of 
the UF Department of Pediatrics, said Weinstein is inspirational.
“Dr. Weinstein is an excep-
tional physician, and even more exceptional than his clinical skills is his dedication to his patients,” Rivkees said.
Through internet communi-
cation, Weinstein helps manage the disease of patients outside of Gainesville.
One of Weinstein’s patients 
used social media to encour -
age Weinstein’s other patients to write letters nominating him for the award. 
She collected the letters and 
composed them into a book for him.
“The person who had col-
lected the letters was so excited about this that she couldn’t keep it a secret,” he said. “That’s how I learned about the nomination.  All of a sudden I was getting calls, one day, from patients in Europe saying you won an award.”  
Weinstein said he received let-
ters written by 2- and 3-year-olds with the help of their parents.
“Every single letter was mov-
ing,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JANUARY 15, 2013

As the new semester starts, the school 
gyms have filled up with students trying 
to fulfill New Year’s resolutions and start a new semester in shape.
The Southwest Recreation Center got so 
busy Friday that the weight room was re-duced to a “one in, one out policy,” as the room got too full to be safe.
The maximum occupancy of the weight 
room is determined by square footage, amount of equipment in the room and how many staffers are present, said Leah Du-puie, coordinator for fitness programs with RecSports. 
She said the optimum ratio of gym mem-
bers to staff is about 50 to 1, and the capacity is about 220 people.
Within the first week, about 39,000 
people went to the campus gyms, and the weight room reached capacity between 3:30 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. That’s when the “one in, one out policy” occasionally takes effect.Dupuie said the reason the gym gets so 
busy at 3:30 p.m. is parking at Southwest Rec lifts, so people can come to the gym without needing a decal. She said it takes a while for people to realize when the busiest times are.
While it is possible that many of the gym 
attendees are there to stick to their New Year’s resolutions, Dupuie said the same rush happens in the Fall.
“It’s a new semester, new you,” she said.According to gym numbers, about 38,000 
people went to the campus gyms the first week of the Fall semester.
Janie Blanco, a 21-year-old political sci-
ence junior, said she noticed an increase in gym-goers. She said she tries to go to the gym every day, and she goes during class times so she can avoid the rush in the eve-ning.
Blanco notices the rush every beginning 
of the semester, but with a new year, it’s even worse than usual.
“It will take a couple weeks to die down,” 
she said.TUESDAY, JANUARY 15, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

The season of giving hasn’t end-
ed yet.
To provide care for the grow-
ing homeless population, Greeks 
for Gainesville, a student-run pro-gram, has joined the efforts of the Helping Hands Clinic to donate hot meals.
Michael Watson, the fraternity coordinator, started volunteering with the Helping Hands Clinic in March and said he created the pro-gram after seeing how desperate the clinic was for donations.
“It’s extremely rewarding,” said 
the 21-year-old applied physiology and kinesiology senior. “You defi-nitely get a sense of accomplish-ment and appreciation.”
Since the program began, Sigma 
Chi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Alpha Tau Omega and Kappa Alpha fra-ternities, along with Alpha Delta Pi and Delta Delta Delta sororities, have joined Greeks for Gainesville. The organization donates two meals a month, doubling the amount of food the clinic was able to provide before. The food is prepared in the chapter houses, then delivered and served by sorority or fraternity members.
Watson, a member of Sigma Chi, 
said this program is an eye-opener.
“All students at UF are living on 
an island that is the University of Florida,” he said. “You come out of this with a perspective on your life, and you realize your worries aren’t as important as you used to think.”
Corrine Kunkle, a 21-year-old 
biology senior and the sorority co-ordinator, helped Watson start the program over the summer.
Kunkle, a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority, said it was sad to see so much food thrown away at her house and was glad chapters were getting involved to donate food and leftovers.
Watson’s and Kunkle’s next step 
is to incorporate clothing donations into the program.
“The houses and the people in 
them are wanting to help, and this was a perfect opportunity to do that right in Gainesville,” Watson said. “It’s hands-on helping people.”

The Consumer Electronics Show, better known as CES, wrapped up last week and, as always, blew my mind with things that I could never afford but 
desperately want to buy.  
Like every year, all the big names such as Samsung, In-
tel and Panasonic (just to name a few) came in to show off their groundbreaking products like proud mothers, while smaller companies showcased their kickstarter-funded in-novations.
The show isn’t open to the public, so the companies 
never have to worry about the trivial things, like the prac-ticality of their product or its ridiculous price tag.  It’s tech-nological innovation for its own sake and not to please a consumer base, and that can be a truly magical thing when it comes to pushing boundaries.
Now, I am not a gearhead by any means.I am so far behind the curve of technology that I am the 
only person I know of who still calls 411 instead of Goo-gling a phone number.
But there is a special place in my heart for tech shows 
because they show the best, worst and most bizarre cre-ations of humanity all within the same showroom.
So, with that said, here are my top four picks for the 
good, the bad and the ugly from this CES:
iPotty — Yeah, you read that right. It’s a colorful, plas-
tic toddler’s training potty with an iPad attached, so while you encourage junior to pee-pee in the big-boy place, he can play Angry Birds. Thank the Lord the iPad stand has a splash guard or else your $300 iPad would end up smell-ing like a high school restroom. Completely silly? No way, it’s just the toilet-training device of the future. It’s like the next generation’s version of the “Everyone Poops” book.
T9000 Smart Refrigerator — Tired of that Post-it note 
and magnet system of reminders on your fridge door? Well, friend, cry no more because the T9000 comes equipped with an LCD screen and an Evernote app so you can remind yourself to buy more milk. Plus, if you really like standing by your refrigera-tor poking a screen, it has apps for a calendar and weather up-dates. The only problem is, this fridge costs $4,000, so I think I will stick to Post-it notes for a while longer.
Trakdot — It’s so useful, I 
am surprised no one thought of 
it before. When going on a trip, drop the little GPS box into your luggage. When you arrive at your destination but your luggage shows up missing, Trakdot will text or email you your luggage’s location, or you can use the app to check online. 
At $50, it only pays for itself if you are a serious fre-
quent ﬂ  yer, but I still like the idea behind it because noth-ing is more frustrating than losing your luggage when you’re traveling.
Oculus Rift — A virtual reality gaming headset that 
shows images in 3-D, Oculus Rift was deﬁ  nitely the cool-est item to come out of the entire week. The prototype that debuted at CES looked a little hand-crafted with gaffer tape across the lens of what looked like ski goggles, but everyone who has written a review said it was easily the most revolutionary thing at the show. 
Products that announce themselves as “virtual reality” 
often end up being a bit hokey, but Oculus has taken leaps and bounds with the technology. When this headset is ﬁ  n-ished, I think it’s seriously going to kick gaming experi-ence up to a new level.
CES 2013 might have created some new records with 
the mighty and the frivolous this year, but luckily we can always count on those techies to outdo themselves in 2014.

Schmomedy: 
Glenn Close pretended 
to be drunk, and it 
was awesome
To quote Tina Fey, “Bitches get stuff done.”
Did you watch the Golden Globes on Sunday? Because 
nearly 20 million viewers tuned in to watch the awards 
show, earning the show the best ratings it has seen in six years.
It’s because women are funny. In a 2009 Emmy roundtable, 
in which an interviewer asked a bunch of Emmy-nominated folk 
some questions, Amy Poehler was asked if she thought any-thing had changed for women in the past few years, regarding the “myth” that women “can’t be as funny as men.” 
“This question is boring,” Poehler said. Let’s stop asking them that. Instead, let’s bow down to the 
display of comedic perfection that displayed itself on TV sets this weekend. Everything they did was hilarious. Was there a weird sort of pressure on them as female comedians to do well? Ab-solutely . But it’s not necessarily because they are ladies. There’s pressure on most comedians to do well, because that’s the whole point of comedy.
Take Louis C.K., for example. His comedic style is to be super 
real, to make jokes everyone can relate to rather than just yelling profanities during his set. He earns the laughs with his audience instead of being only loud or weird.
So did Fey and Poehler. The opening of the night was a lot 
like an extended “Weekend Update” from their days on “Sat-urday Night Live.” The rest of the awards provided them few opportunities to make us all laugh, but they fully utilized what time they did have.
We have no idea if they’ll be asked back to host next year’s 
gala, but they could host anything, and the country would sup-port them entirely . Here’s our analysis of why it went so well: We already love them.
When Ricky Gervais hosts awards shows, half the country is 
angry at his irreverent style, and the other half wants to grab a pint with him. Fey and Poehler, on the other hand, are already America’s sweethearts. They’ve each achieved that after a lot of hard work. They had to overcome a lot of adversity on the ﬁ  eld.
“‘Say yes, and you’ll ﬁ  gure it out afterward’ has helped me to 
be more adventurous,” said Fey in an interview in O Magazine, according to Hufﬁ  ngton Post. “It has deﬁ  nitely helped me be less afraid.”
Comedians everywhere are, we believe, grateful for all the 
things Fey and Poehler have said ‘yes’ to over the years, as they have proven to be, time and time again, role models for every-one. Forget gender. Forget whether you actually enjoy watching rich Hollywood stars win awards for three hours, multiple times a year. Forget all of that.
Just say ‘yes’ to great opportunities that come your way . Who 
knows? You, too, could pull a Poehler and canoodle on George Clooney’s lap.

This December, our world survived the end of the 
Mayan calendar.
Amid online prophecies of impending Arma-
geddon, we weathered the end of times — and resur -
faced unharmed, if not unfazed.
Remarkably enough, 2012 is not the first time we 
have managed to avoid certain existential destruction.
The Smithsonian magazine reports that Assyr -
ian tablets dating as far back as 2800 B.C. warn of the world’s imminent demise, while 15th century math-ematician Johannes Stoffler frightened Europe with predictions of a catastrophic flood.
Scarcely a year ago, Christian radio personality Har -
old Camping twice proclaimed that the long-awaited Rapture was finally at hand. In an act of shocking resil-ience, humanity survived yet again — twice. 
Perennial predictions of the destructive event we 
have all expected for centuries may disappoint — but predictions of yet more doomsday predictions are nev-er off the mark. 
Far more certain than the occurrence of an actual 
catastrophe is our continued fascination with eschatol-ogy, our facility for invoking the prospect of our own obliteration.
Something about the existence of our world seems 
to consistently hint at its own negation. Yet there must be more to this phenomenon than the mere fact that the world is. 
After all, we are uniquely inclined to theorize about 
the end of the world, and we tend to avoid apocalyp-tic alarmism about all sorts of existent objects. When, if ever, has anyone precipitated mass hysteria by pre-dicting the end of something as inconsequential as Fair Isle sweaters, for instance?
In his poem “The Hollow Men,” writer and critic 
T.S. Eliot articulates his vision of a thoroughly dissatis-fying apocalypse — for the “stuffed men” who occupy Eliot’s oeuvre, the world ends “not with a bang” but with “a whimper.”
Eliot isolates what I regard as one of the main at-
tractions of a dramatic apocalypse — it functions as a bastion against mediocrity. The hellish scenes that pervade Hieronymus Bosch paintings and traditional theological texts may be unnerving, but at least they are never boring. Fire and brimstone could salvage even the most banal life by infusing it with an element of much-needed adventure.
Perhaps the collective cultural fantasy of sensation-
al death is a backlash against its perceived opposite — scenarios involving Fair Isle sweaters and other J. Crew merchandise, which is to say, life at its most elegant but least eventful.
The glamour that accompa-
nies bloody and dramatic de-struction is not only a salient 
feature of many artistic traditions, but also an accepted fact of contemporary culture. In countless TV shows, suave protagonists clad in form-fitting spandex save the world from the looming menace of nonexistence time and time again, inflicting and receiving injuries along the way.
World-saving violence is portrayed as exciting, 
even sexy.
In pop culture artifacts such as “True Blood” and 
“Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” consensual sexual exchanges are often suffused with brutality. In one scene of “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” what begins as a sparring match between Buffy and her undead love interest quickly transforms into an amorous encounter.
Ever the feminist, Buffy pins her former opponent 
against a wall and kisses him passionately as a build-ing crumbles around them.
The eroticization of death finds its precedent in the 
operatic works of Richard Wagner, who originated the concept of “liebestod,” or erotic death. In “Tristan and Isolde,” death functions for a pair of doomed lovers as the consummation of an affair that went unresolved in life. Apocalypse, too, is a sort of seductive force, prom-ising an alluring oblivion and allowing for personal capitulation to otherwise repressed savagery.
Mass death also presents itself as a unifying phe-
nomenon. Total destruction presents us with an alter -
native to confronting death alone — and to leaving a vibrant world behind us. Rather than exiting a rich re-ality, our own death would coincide with the demoli-tion of everything we might have missed.
Of death, poet Rainer Maria Rilke wrote, “it is 
strange to inhabit the earth no longer…not to see roses and other promising Things in terms of a human fu-ture; no longer to be what one was in infinitely anxious hands; to leave even one’s own first name behind.”
In a doomsday scenario, we are spared the difficul-
ty of conceptualizing the world, absent our experience of it — we can sustain the comforting illusion that our presence in the universe is an integral part of its con-tinued existence.

Two weeks ago, President Barack Obama signed into 
law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 in an eleventh-hour effort to avert the so-called fiscal cliff 
crisis. The cliff, a term coined by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, refers to a series of automatic tax increases and spending cuts that would have otherwise gone into effect had congressional action not been taken. Because desperation seems to be the only factor that can motivate Congress to act, the House and Senate passed the aforementioned act in the early hours of the new year. 
Immediately , Washington tried to paint the law as a grand 
compromise between painfully divided Democrats and Re-publicans. This might be the case if the act accomplished anything more than kicking the metaphorical can down the road, which, sadly , it does not. Instead, the law simply serves to turn over the hourglass, once again, by raising taxes on the very highest incomes and enacting minimal spending cuts.
The fact that the ATRA was passed with almost 90 votes in 
the Senate is indicative of the political unpalatability of poten-tially allowing the consequences of diving over the fiscal cliff to occur. Although the fiscal cliff was designed as a measure to reduce the ever-ballooning national debt, the occurrence of its provisions would have, according to Congressional Bud-get Office projections, led to a mild recession and an increase in the unemployment rate. 
Obviously , this was not an option for Congress, even in a 
nonelection year. The economy , after spending several years mired in the sewer, is showing signs of cautious improve-ment. Unemployment has slowly declined and home sales 
have increased. A reversal of these already-fragile gains, apart from tan-gibly harming the American public, would have turned an unpopular Congress into a loathed one. And so, the men and women on the Hill were 
faced with two options — find true compromise and enact difficult yet meaningful budget reform, or push through an ineffectual measure and act satisfied. Unsurprisingly, they chose the latter path, and the nation will, in the long run, hurt for it.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the revenue 
raised by tax increases in the ATRA is 41 times greater than the revenue saved by spending cuts. The figure should seem strange and alarming even to those who have no knowledge of economics or fiscal policy . 
Such an imbalance can only be explained by the fact that 
the real dollar amounts analogous to this ratio are compara-tively small, thus the underwhelming nature of the law. The new taxes will raise approximately $60 billion per year for the next 10 years, a token figure in the context of a trillion-dollar budget deficit. Most of the new tax revenue is derived from an increase in the income tax for those making more than $400,000 per year and an increase in the payroll tax. 
The latter measure is a two percent tax increase on every-
one; the former, while not totally objectionable, is little more than a bone thrown to the sizeable portion of the population that wrongly believes the nation’s problems can be solved by putting the screws to the rich. Since the revenues raised by such measures pale in comparison to the future cost of Amer -
ica’s entitlement programs, the actual potency of these new taxes toward reducing the debt is near-zero.
And so, Congress conveniently ignored solutions that, 
while tricky , would have provided for lasting reform. These potential solutions are well-known and are neither innovative nor new — Social Security reform and more efficient defense spending are two examples. These expenditures are deeply entrenched in the Washington status quo, and tackling them would be hard. However, the difficulty of any action does not change the necessity of it. 
The spectre of a United States with an ever-reddening bal-
ance sheet and the consequences of such a situation are far graver than the potential threat of a temporarily recessed economy. In theory, legislators would understand the impor -
tance of providing for the future, even at the possible expense of the present. Unfortunately , that does not seem to be the case. 
However, as college students who have to look toward the 
future, this is indeed a lesson that we need to understand.

UWireJoe Taranto, whose name is on the official con-
test entry, won $25,000 for being a finalist and a 
five-day trip to New Orleans to watch the Super Bowl live from a private suite in the stadium. The suite will have a TV that will air the two winning commercials during the game. The Taranto broth-ers will watch with the four other contest finalists, Doritos executives and Michael Bay.
“I’ve been to many Gator bowl games in the 
Swamp, but I’ve never been to the Super Bowl,” Vinnie Taranto said.
Of all the Super Bowl commercials played this 
year, the one that scores the highest on the USA To-day Ad Meter rankings will get a $1 million bonus and the opportunity to work with Bay on the next “Transformers” movie.
“This could be a huge career opportunity for 
me,” Joe Taranto said.
Vinnie Taranto, who works at his family’s prop-
erty management business in Melbourne Beach, identifies himself as the analytical and organized one of the pair with a sense for business. He said his brother, a film graduate student at Loyola Mary-mount University, is the creative mastermind.
While attending UF, the Taranto brothers es-
tablished a relationship with telecommunication professor James Babanikos. After they graduated in 2006 and 2002, the brothers kept in touch with their favorite professor.
“They’re just so humble and hardworking and 
fun,” Babanikos said. “I couldn’t be happier.”
With only five days until the window for entries 
closed Nov. 15, Joe Taranto bounced ideas for the commercial off his brother. Soon a common theme was agreed upon: “Be careful what you wish for.”
“It’s like a twist,” Vinnie Taranto said.The brothers’ 30-second video stars a grandma’s 
dog, a four-year-old Yorkie and Chihuahua mix named Petal, who is left in her grandson’s care with specific instructions not to play fetch.
If the Taranto brothers win one of the cash prize 
spots, they said they would divide the winnings be-tween 17 people involved in the making of “Fetch,” as well as donate a portion to the Humane Society , where Petal was rescued.
Babanikos said he will be watching the Super 
Bowl for the commercials, particularly to see if his star students won.
“I would smile to the person next to me and say , 
‘You know who did that?’” Babanikos said.
For now, the Taranto brothers said they’re look-
ing forward to their trip to New Orleans and the chance to meet Michael Bay.
“We’re just trying to think of a good prank to get 
him back,” Joe Taranto said.
“I might just jump into Michael Bay’s lap,” Vin-
nie Taranto said.

Once a week, the typically quiet, 
tense Neonatal Intensive Care Unit 
at Shands at UF receives a mood lift, proving that art does wonders for the mind, body and soul.
While working to earn a certifi-
cate from the Center for the Arts in Medicine at UF, Emily Pozek’s as-signment to create a mock volunteer plan escalated into an organization known as Little Dreamers, where she and 2005 UF journalism alumna Danielle DeCosmo sing to the babies and stretch with the parents and nurses.
Pozek, a 24-year-old dance senior, took her interest in what the arts can do for health and applied it to her project, coming up with the idea to sing lullabies to babies in the NICU. After pairing up with DeCosmo, 29, the Musician in Residence at Shands, Pozek’s proposal came to life in July . As DeCosmo goes to each bedside with her mandolin, singing nontra-ditional lullabies like “Somewhere over the Rainbow,” Pozek leads a quick and easy stretch for stressed out parents who spend most of their time hovering and worrying.
“It really does a lot,” Pozek said. 
“They’re in really stressful situa-tions — imagine having a sick baby. We found that providing a little bit of music and relaxation in the unit can be transformative.”
In some situations, mothers have 
not been able to hold their babies since birth because they’re in an en-closed incubator. When Pozek and DeCosmo come around, the nurses open the incubators so the babies can hear the music, covering up the beeping of the machines and allow-ing the mothers to touch their chil-dren.
“It’s very special because they’re 
sharing this moment,” DeCosmo said. “It’s not just music for the ba-bies. It’s more this whole commu-nity and family feeling. [Parents] are able to hold their baby while this music is going on — something they can’t do throughout the day.”Pozek thought to record a CD 
to give to families and nurses to de-stress at home. After receiving do-nations from family and friends, she raised enough money for DeCosmo to record seven of their most request-ed songs, plus a guided stretch on the eighth track that Pozek wrote.
With their long shifts, the nurses 
look forward to the stretching as well.“I absolutely love it,” Registered 
Nurse Dale Franquemont said. “I’ve never heard one problem, except that they make us cry.”
On Feb. 24, Pozek and DeCosmo 
are holding a fundraiser at Sweet Dreams Ice Cream to create a contin-uous fund to supply CDs and pre-pare for the possibility of expanding Little Dreamers throughout Shands and other hospitals.
“It’s a beneficial experience for 
everyone involved,” Pozek said. “By working through Shands Arts and Medicine, I’ve been able to cre-ate a really unique path for myself. I’m enjoying being able to use what I’ve done for years to benefit other people. It shaped my future.”

North Central Florida has the 
highest cancer mortality rate in 
the state, according to a recent re-port from a Florida Department of Health cancer control initiative.  
The death rate of all cancers 
in the region is 28 percent higher than the rest of the state, according to the 2013 North Central Florida Cancer Report.
The report compared cancer 
death rates, incidence rates, emer -
gency room visits and hospital discharge data from 11 counties including Alachua, Bradford and Levy counties.
Although the number of docu-
mented new cancer diagnoses is lower in the region than in the state, North Central Florida resi-dents are dying of cancer more frequently, according to a press re-lease from the WellFlorida Council for the North Central Florida Can-cer Control Collaborative.
“This discrepancy indicates a 
need for improvement in cancer screening, education, awareness, access to healthcare services and other systemic issues,” said Jeff Feller, chief executive officer for WellFlorida, in a statement.
Lauren Pollock, a council as-
sociate planner for WellFlorida, said the percent of advanced-stage colorectal, breast, cervical and prostate cancers diagnosed in the region is higher than the state av-erage.
“That statistic was the most 
shocking to me, because they’re all cancers that have regular screen-ings,” she said. “These are ones that can be caught in time, but these people aren’t being screened.”
The report suggests that rural 
populations experience higher mortality rates from certain can-cers.
In some of the 
region’s more ru-
ral counties, 21 percent of resi-dents live below poverty and the rates of unin-sured residents are as high as 28 percent, accord-
ing to the report.
Dr. Folakemi T. Odedina, an as-
sociate director for the UF Shands Cancer Center, said although so-cioeconomics and limited health care access is one part of the issue, getting regularly screened and liv-ing a healthy lifestyle can reduce the risk of cancer.
“I think the report is a wakeup 
call for the community,” she said. “We really have to work together hand in hand to solve the cancer problem.”State’s cancer mortality

Because of the unusually 
high winter temperatures state-
wide, the gray , gentle giants that swim Florida’s rivers and springs enjoyed a better chance of survival last year.
The Florida Fish and Wild-
life Conservation Commission documented only 28 cold stress-related manatee deaths in 2012 — nearly 90 less than the year before, according to a FWC news release.
In 2011, the FWC reported 
453 total manatee deaths, but 2012 only saw 392. 
Kevin Baxter, a spokesman 
for the commission, said the un-characteristically warm winter months factored into the differ -
ence.
He said manatees are sus-
ceptible to cold stress syndrome when the water temperature dips below 68 degrees Fahren-heit.
If manatees are exposed to 
cold water for a long time they could contract the illness, which causes weight loss, skin lesions, dehydration and eventually death, Baxter said.
In past years, the disease has 
caused more manatee deaths be-cause they didn’t have enough time to reach warmer water be-fore temperatures plummeted.
The FWC tries to keep wa-
terways open for manatees to escape sinking temperatures to graze in warmer springs, Baxter said, and the temperatures of 2012 worked with them.
“We’re always working to 
make sure there are warm-wa-ter habitats accessible for mana-tees,” he said.
Jonathan Miot, director of the 
Santa Fe College Teaching Zoo, said the impacts of a higher 2013 manatee population on Flori-da’s aquatic environments and on the manatee population’s food supply, which includes un-derwater plants, are difficult to determine.
“It’s always tough to specu-
late about what that can mean, especially when you’re consid-ering ecosystems,” he said. “In a warmer month, their food sources should grow to support them, but it’s always tough to say.”
If the manatees’ food sup-
ply doesn’t increase, Miot said, it could lead to more manatee deaths due to malnourishment.
“We’re glad their popula-
tions are up, but it’s tough to say what that means specifically ,” he said. “That’s where we need more people to study them.”Because two species of man-
atees are listed by the FWC as endangered and another spe-cies is considered “threatened,” Miot said, the increased mana-tee activity can be good for con-servation, as well as Florida’s economy.
“It actually will help tour -
ism if we do have more of them around and if it’s advertised ap-propriately,” he said.
Miot said appropriate adver -
tising includes inviting the pub-lic to watch the manatees and discouraging approaching the animals in the wild.
Julie Wolf, owner of Florida 
Manatee Tours and Crystal Riv-er Watersports in Crystal River, said the warmer weather can have drawbacks for her busi-ness because manatees tend to be more visible when tempera-tures plummet.
“In the colder weather, they 
hover together,” Wolf, 64, said. “They’ll crowd in really close together to keep warm.”
But even with warmer tem-
peratures, she said, finding manatees for sightseers hasn’t been an issue.
“I’m a native Floridian, and 
there’s always been manatees for me,” she said.“It’s the real Florida ... It’s a real, natural fan-tasy.”

 Antoinette Bannister never considered 
the Gators during her recruitment pro-
cess.  The Jacksonville Potter’s House Chris-
tian Academy standout guard received scholarship offers from college basketball’s premier programs — Tennessee, Connecti-cut and Rutgers, among others — before verbally committing to North Carolina as a sophomore in high school in February 2010. 
  But Bannister reconsidered her decision 
to play for the Tar Heels after her mother fell ill in October.
After one semester 
with UNC, she decided to transfer to Florida and enrolled in classes on Fri-day.
  Bannister will redshirt 
this season and become eligible to play the day 
after UF’s 2013 fall semester concludes.  “In October, I found out my mom was 
sick,” Bannister said. “I had been battling with whether or not I wanted to be closer to home or stay at UNC, but after a lot of praying and talking to my family and teammates, they understand why I trans-ferred.”
  Lurise Bannister, Antoinette’s moth-
“Chondromalacia. I think it’s some kind of rubbing underneath 
your knee cap. Whatever that does to you or whatever that means, 
I’m not really sure. I hope I pronounced it correctly.”

� PRATHER WILL MISS 10-14 
DAYS WITH THE INJURY.
  KATIE AGOSTIN
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 Forward Casey Prather is again 
dealing with injury. 
  Coach Billy Donovan expects 
Prather to be out for the next 10-14 
days.
The junior suffered a high left 
ankle sprain late in the ﬁ  rst half of No. 10 Florida’s 74-52 win against LSU on Saturday.
  “We were having a hard time 
scoring in the ﬁ  rst half against LSU, and he really kind of gave us a spark to close out the half before he got hurt,” Donovan said.
“It’s unfortunate. He’s had to 
deal with some different things through the course of his career, but thank God it’s not a severe high ankle sprain where you’re out for a month to six weeks.”
  Prather’s ankle is the newest ad-
dition to his already extensive in-jury list. He began the season with a concussion, which he suffered on Oct. 27 in a scrimmage against Rol-lins College. 
  Prather missed Florida’s 101-71 
exhibition win against Nebraska-Kearney on Nov. 1 in the O’Connell Center.
Prather’s luck did not improve 
when he returned to action. 
  During practice on Nov. 5, cen-
ter Patric Young went up for a re-bound and elbowed Prather in the head on the way down. Prather suffered his second concussion in nine days.
The junior forward   missed a 
matchup against Georgetown that was canceled at half time and the next four games.
  Finally, Prather returned to the 
court on Nov. 23 to help Florida defeat UCF 79-66.Still, the forward didn’t escape 
without injury. 
  Prather took a hit to the face, 
which required him to get his lip stitched up during halftime. 
  Prather made it through the next 
eight games without any mishaps,

Sophomore thrower Jayla 
Bostic posted a career-best throw during the Crimson Tide Indoor Opener.See story, page 16.SEE INJURY, PAGE 15  Coach Amanda Butler left 
her team with more ques-tions than answers after 
squandering a victory against the team from Rocky Top.
  The Gators wore a sense of 
frustration on their faces address-ing the media after the three-point loss. 
  With less than 30 seconds left in overtime and the score 
tied 75-75, the sixth-year coach instructed Florida guard Carlie Needles to foul Tennessee’s Kamiko Williams, a ca-reer 73 percent shooter at the free-throw line, even though there were no fouls to give.
  Williams sank 1 of 2 shots, which gave the Gators just 24 
seconds to overcome a one-point deﬁ  cit for their ﬁ  rst win against a top-10 team in seven seasons.
  Two missed free throws and a desperate three-pointer 
at the buzzer spelled the end of Florida’s upset bid on Sat-urday. The question remained, why foul? 
  Tennessee coach Holly Warlick stopped short of saying 
she’d do the same thing as well. The beneﬁ  t comes with giving your team the last shot, but at the potential cost of falling behind and losing the tie your team worked so hard to reach.
  “It was one of those calculated risks sort of things, and it 
was a bad decision,” Butler said. “Even though [Williams] only hit one, it was still a bad decision.”
  In an age where it’s sacrilege for a coach to reveal 
any sort of injury, useful tidbit or hint of emotion, Butler showed what she’s about.
  There are no moral victories against any team, but how 
Butler addressed the choice was refreshing and the right thing to do.
  The foul didn’t single-handedly cost Florida the game 
(missing more free throws than you make can do that) but the decision took the contest away from the Florida de-fense. Playing the result isn’t fair, but in this case, the foul wasn’t a smart basketball move. 
  Florida should have beaten No. 9 Tennessee. The Gators 
outrebounded and outhustled the Volunteers without its best bruiser in forward Jennifer George, who suffered a shoulder injury late in the ﬁ  rst half. Butler refreshingly 
honest in defeat

Antoinette Bannister has decided to transfer from UNC to UF. 
She will be eligible to play following the Fall 2013 semester.

er, recently had ovarian surgery. Antoinette said her 
mother was doing well but wanted to be closer to her family and support Lurise through her ongoing health issues. 
That moved Florida into consideration. Bannister 
also considered South Florida before choosing the Gators.
“UF had a scholarship for me right away,” Bannis-
ter said.
“I know a lot about Florida. Just knowing coach 
(Amanda) Butler for years — I used to come to her camps — that’s what made me come here.”
At Potter’s House, Bannister compiled one of the 
more impressive careers in the state of Florida.
As a junior, she averaged 27.2 points, 7.5 steals and 
7.1 rebounds per game. She finished her career averag-ing more than 23 points and eight rebounds as a se-nior. 
“She’s a very good player, especially on the offen-
sive end,” Butler said.
“She can handle it. She can pass it. She can really 
shoot it at a deep range. I think she brings a lot of in-tangibles.” 
Bannister was named a second-team USA Today 
All-America selection in high school.
HoopGurlz ranked her as the No. 59 prospect in the 
Class of 2012.
She was the fifth-ranked player from the state of Florida.
“Antoinette is used to playing at a championship 
level,” Butler said.
“We’re just fortunate to be able to have a chance 
with her.”
Bannister played eight games at North Carolina be-
fore opting to transfer, averaging 4.3 points and 1.6 re-bounds per game in less than nine minutes of action. 
She scored a career-best 13 points in 19 minutes in a 
75-49 win against Coastal Carolina on Dec. 16 in Con-way, S.C. 
Moving forward, she will be a critical piece in Flor -
ida’s puzzle.
The Gators already have a commitment from Ronni 
Williams, the No. 13 high school prospect in the Class of 2013. 
Butler hopes Bannister and Williams can strengthen 
Florida’s roster, one that is currently filled with prom-ising young players. 
“A really bright future,” Butler said.“I think we are going to have some of the best 
guards in the country.”

There was nothing surprising about the 
Gators sticking with the Volunteers. The last 
four games between Florida and Southeastern Conference powers Tennessee and Kentucky were decided by an average of five points.
When I mindlessly asked if the “good show-
ing” against Tennessee means anything for her program, Butler responded with candor.
“I don’t want to disrespect your question, 
but we didn’t come out here today for a great showing, and that’s the thing that you guys won’t see as much — the things we said and the things we talked about in the locker room. This team is not satisfied by losing by three to Tennessee in overtime. It is not OK. We are not a team that is ever going to be OK with a loss by any margin anywhere, because I think we are one of the best teams in the country.”
Butler said all the right things after perhaps 
costing her team a win against the Volunteers.
What stood out wasn’t that Florida should 
have defeated the SEC mountaintop dwellers from Rocky Top, but how its coach acted in the face of defeat.
Give Butler credit. She realized her mistake 
and owned up to it. That’s something we all can learn from.

but landed awkwardly on his foot af-
ter jumping for a rebound with 1:38 left in the half on Saturday in Baton Rouge, La. 
“He kind of just landed on his foot 
and it wasn’t anything that looked on film to be too bad,” Donovan said. 
“Initially, I was told at halftime that 
he might have broken something, but obviously the X-rays came back nega-tive. We will miss him because he is a versatile player, and he has played well for us so far.”
Prather has averaged 6.8 points and 3.3 rebounds per game in his lim-ited time.
Prather isn’t the only Gator nurs-
ing an injury. Mike Rosario (ankle), Will Yeguete (knee tendinitis) and Erik Murphy (fractured rib) are all ex-pected to play Thursday when Flori-da heads to College Station, Texas, to take on Texas A&M. 
Rosario sat out during Saturday’s 
win to rest his left ankle, which he sprained during Florida’s 77-44 win against Georgia on Jan. 9. 
“We just came in knowing adversi-
ty’s going to hit,” Patric Young said. 
“Guys are going to get hurt. It just 
sucks that it has to be Casey right now and Mike. I’ve just been very blessed to not have anything major. We’re go-ing to miss those guys, but we’re go-ing to adjust and prepare and go out with what we have.”

Two Gators did not wait 
long to have career-best perfor -
mances in the weight throw.
Sophomores Jayla Bos-
tic and David Levin both set 
personal records in the event at the Crimson Tide Indoor Opener in Birmingham, Ala., on Saturday.
“It just shows their hard 
work, and their work ethic,” coach Mike Holloway said. 
In the women’s field, Bos-
tic’s mark of 18.85m was sec-ond behind LSU’s Denise Hin-ton (19.71m).
For the men, Levin finished 
third with a throw of 18.44m.
Both throwers have benefit-
ed from working with throw-ing coach Steve Lemke, who earned praise from Holloway on Monday.
“I make no bones about it, I think Steve Lemke is one of the best, if not the best, throw-ing coach in the country,” Hol-loway said.
Holloway said Bostic and 
Levin have benefitted from be-ing around other top athletes like senior Jeremy Postin and former Gator Kemal Mesic.
Although Bostic and Levin 
are inexperienced, Holloway 
said fresh-men and sophomores are ex-
pected to compete and win at Florida.
Freshman Arman Hall 
turned in a stellar performance in his college debut.
Hall ran the final leg of the 
men’s 4x400-meter relay. The team turned in a winning per -
formance, finishing in 3:07.59, the second-fastest time in the NCAA in 2013.
Hall placed second in the 200 meter with a time of 21.22 seconds.
“He was stuck down in 
Lane 3, and a lot of times, ath-letes get stuck in a lane they don’t really want to be in, and they kind of back off,” Hollo-way said.
“He went out, competed 
hard, and actually that was the second-fastest time of his life.”
Holloway reiterated that 
the meet was just the first of many for the Gators this sea-son.
Florida has eight events be-
fore the NCAA Indoor Cham-pionships on March 8-9 in Fayetteville, Ark.
“The moment we wake up 
and think that we’ve made it (is) the moment we wake up and think that everybody’s going to lay down for us,” Holloway said. “Then, clearly, we’ve lost our minds.”

A team with five upperclassmen and a 
veteran coach typically relies on experience 
to carry it through the season.
But for the Gators men’s tennis team, that 
won’t be the case.
Coach Bryan Shelton and his Florida 
squad will rely on youth in 2013.
Florida finished the individual fall season 
last weekend at the Three Oaks Shootout in Fort Myers. The team begins its spring sea-son with a matchup against Miami on Satur-day at Linder Stadium.
Shelton has one freshman, one redshirt freshman, three juniors and two seniors.
Two of the three juniors — Florent Diep 
and Stephane Piro — have limited experi-ence at the college level.
Diep played 34 matches professionally 
before enrolling at UF in January 2012.
“Diep, who is playing probably the best 
of anyone on our team in the fall, is only in his second year here although he is a junior,” Shelton said.
The Frenchman put together an impres-
sive 13-6 individual record in his first fall season. He also had success in doubles, go-ing 10-3 when teamed up with fellow junior Michael Alford.
Piro, on the other hand, made his college debut last weekend, winning all three of his individual matches. 
“It was great to see him handle it well and 
just to continue to play and compete and make adjust-ments where he needed to,” Shelton said.
In Shelton’s case, he is 
learning, too. He left his coaching position with the 
women’s team at Geor-gia Tech to take over the men’s program at Florida 
in June. While adjusting to his new job at UF, Shelton has worked on growing the pro-gram and instilling his philosophy with his new players.
“Developing is more than helping the 
guys on their forehand or backhand or serve, but it’s really trying to instill good habits,” Shelton said. “Doing things the right way.”
Shelton said he and his coaching staff 
have come across many challenges in their first year already but have embraced the ob-stacles.
“Every decision made is with the best in-
terest in mind,” Shelton said.
Knowing he will have to overcome some 
inexperience this season, Shelton wouldn’t have it any other way.
“I’m proud to be here, proud to be a 
Gator,” Shelton said.
