The sheep were on their way to a slaughterhouse when they 
were tossed out of the overturned tractor-trailer near the New Jersey-Pennsylvania line. Truck driver Marvin Raber told the Pocono Record he tried to change lanes, and his truck flipped over.
It took about four hours before both eastbound lanes re-

Ribbons placed in remembrance of the victims of serial killer Danny Rolling blow in the 
breeze on Southwest 34th Street on Thursday. Rolling murdered five students in Gainesville in late August 1990.

When the carillon bells of Cen-
tury Tower tolled at noon Thurs-
day, about 75 people gathered  to pay tribute to five local college 
students who were murdered in 
August 1990. 
Thursday marked the 20-year 
anniversary of the discovery of 
serial killer Danny Rolling’s first 
victims. 
UF held a brief memorial at 
the five trees standing outside the northwest corner of Smathers 
Library. 
The trees were planted to 
honor the memory of Rolling’s 
victims: UF students Sonja Lar -
son, Christina Powell, Manuel Taboada and Tracy Paules, and Santa Fe College student Christa 
Hoyt.
The carillon bells of Century 
Tower tolled five times in honor 
of the students.
Those in attendance tied white 
ribbons around the trees during each pause. 
Diana Hoyt, stepmother of 
victim Christa, was present for the ceremony, and said even though many of today’s students are too young to remember the murders, she hopes that honor -Ceremony pays

Citing increases in the budget, new 
additions to the faculty and an ever-
consistent crop of talented students, 
UF President Bernie Machen presented an optimistic outlook in his State of the University speech Thursday after -
noon.
Addressing the UF Faculty Senate 
in its first meeting of the semester, Ma-chen gave a positive message, placing a heavy emphasis on launching the uni-
versity onto the global stage.
“We will need to move away from 
the notion of UF as a university based in Gainesville, Florida, the United States [and] the Western Hemisphere,” 
Machen said. “We will need to com-plete a transition we have already set 
in motion, from UF 
as a global presence 
to UF as a global bea-con.” 
To back his claim 
that the university is 
a flourishing institu-
tion, Machen pointed to figures that showed 
a 6 percent increase in UF’s state fund-
ing this year.
In addition, Machen boasted of Machen talks future
� THEY MARCHED FROM THE 
REITZ UNION TO USTLER HALL.
By ANDREW PANTAZI
Alligator Writer
In an effort to raise Democratic voter 
participation during this year’s election sea-
son, about 35 men and women participated in a women’s suffrage march around cam-pus Thursday.
The UF College Democrats hosted the 
March to recreate the 1913 women’s rights march on Washington, D.C.
“It’s been shown that when more wom-
en vote, more Democrats are elected,” said Kristin Klein, president of the UF  College 
Democrats.  The march began on the Reitz Union 
North Lawn and ended at Ustler Hall 
where speeches were given by Mayor Craig Lowe, local political activist Karen Epple, Gainesville Women’s Liberation chairwom-
an Natalie Maxwell and Florida Democratic 
Party chairwoman Karen Thurman.
Gainesville voters are pro-
gressive and vote for people 
based on merit, Lowe said in 
an interview. 
“In Gainesville, four mayors were elect-
ed by popular vote, and two were women,” Lowe said.
Thurman reminded the audience that 
men also play a part in women’s rights.
“Granted, it’s probably because they 
were afraid of going home to their wives,” 
she joked.Student group recreates

A two-and-a-half mile section 
of Northwest 23rd Avenue will be 
getting a $1.6 million face-lift.
The construction,  spanning  
between Northwest 13th Street 
and Waldo Road, will last about  
six months,  said Laurie Windham, a spokeswoman for P .B.S. and J. Consulting, a  firm working with Gainesville and the Florida De-partment of Transportation.
The street, which received its 
last touch-up in 1991, will have three inches of asphalt removed 
and replaced, its sidewalks re-
newed and more wheel-chair ac-cessible ramps installed, she said.
As many as 14,000 vehicles 
travel the road each day, so one lane will remain open at all times for both directions of traffic.  To accommodate rush hour traffic, all lanes will remain open from 7 a.m. 
to 8:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. 
Monday through Friday as well as home football gamedays and the Friday before UF Homecoming.

� HE HAS NOT DECIDED WHETHER TO 
SUPPORT RICK SCOTT, WHO DEFEATED 
HIM IN TUESDAY’S PRIMARY.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Attorney General Bill 
McCollum still had reservations about Rick Scott’s 
character and honesty on Thursday, two days after losing a bruising Republican gubernatorial prima-ry to the wealthy outsider.
McCollum refused to join most members of 
Florida’s GOP establishment who have quickly thrown their support to the former hospital com-pany CEO after they’d overwhelmingly backed McCollum in the primary.
“I still have serious questions, and I have had 
them throughout the time that I’ve had the very brief acquaintanceship with Rick Scott, about is-sues of his character, his integrity , his honesty , 
things that go back to Columbia/HCA,” McCol-
lum said after a Cabinet meeting.
Columbia/HCA was accused of committing 
one of the largest Medicare and Medicaid frauds in history while Scott was running the company. Scott was forced out in the midst of a government investigation in 1997, but he received a rich sever -
ance package. The company paid the government a record $1.7 billion to settle criminal fraud charg-
es. Scott was not charged and said he was unaware 
of the wrongdoing.
Scott put at least $38 million of his own fortune 
into the primary campaign and easily outspent McCollum. He blanketed the state with television ads defending his tenure at Columbia/HCA and ravaging McCollum as a tax-raising “career politi-cian.”The Scott ads also tried to link McCollum — un-
fairly Republican officials insisted — to Jim Greer, now charged with stealing from the Florida GOP while serving as Gov. Charlie Crist’s hand-picked party chairman. Crist has since quit the party to 
run for the U.S. Senate as an independent.
McCollum said he spoke briefly on the tele-
phone with Scott on Wednesday but has never had 
the chance to know him other than shaking hands across the table at debates.
“I await the opportunity if it occurs to get better 
acquainted with him,” McCollum said. “As other voters will do, I will judge him throughout this campaign.”
McCollum said he has received phone calls 
from the Democratic nominee, Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, and in-dependent Lawton “Bud” Chiles III, the son of the late Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles.
McCollum didn’t rule out endorsing either of 
Scott’s opponents but noted he has serious policy differences with Sink.
“I’m particularly concerned with her position 
regarding the national health plan that’s out there right now,” McCollum said. 
McCollum is leading a 20-state legal challenge 
to President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul in federal court in Pensacola.
That should put him on common ground with 
Scott, a leading figure in failed efforts to defeat the legislation in Congress. McCollum, though, made 
it clear he’s in no hurry to kiss and make up.
“I’m not endorsing anyone right now,” McCol-
lum told reporters. “When the time comes I’ll cast 
my ballot. If anything changes in the interim with regard to someone persuading me to get involved with their campaign I’ll certainly inform you.”By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER

A judge will hear the last argu-
ments from a group of concerned 
residents attempting to stop the 
construction of a biomass plant in Gainesville today.
Thomas Bussing, a former 
Gainesville mayor, is challeng-
ing the approval of the site and 
is motioning to intervene on an environmental basis, said Meg Sheehan, spokeswoman for the 
the Anti-Biomass Incineration 
and Forest Protection Campaign. 
Construction on the proposed 
100-megawatt facility, which will be located at the site  of GRU’s 
Deerhaven Generating Station, 
is scheduled to start in Decem-ber. The plant would incinerate wood waste, most of which is 
currently burned in fields with 
no air-quality controls, to create environmentally friendly power, according to GRU’s website. However, the anti-biomass 
group believes the power plant would pollute the air with toxins that could cause asthma attacks and even cancer. 
“Taxpayers think they’re get-
ting clean energy, but they’re get-ting a toxic incinerator,” Sheehan said.
GRU’s website states that bio-
mass is a carbon-neutral power option and that the plant releases the same amount of carbon into the atmosphere as if the wood were left to decay in the forest.
“Taxpayers think they’re 
getting clean energy, but 
they’re getting a toxic 
incinerator.”

NewsStateing her step-daughter’s memory 
will remind students to look out for their safety as they complete 
their college studies. 
“I think we have to look for 
the good part of it,” she said. 
During brief remarks, UF 
President Bernie Machen echoed 
Hoyt’s sentiments. 
“It seems to me that those of 
us in the present have a respon-sibility to the past,” he said. “We 
must look out for one another, 
like a family.” 
Alachua County Sheriff Sadie 
Darnell, who was a lieutenant 
at the time of the murders, said 
there was no better way to honor the victims because trees are a sign of renewal. 
On Aug. 26, 1990, the se-
rial murders sent shockwaves through the Gainesville commu-
nity,.
Classes were canceled, and 
some students temporarily re-
turned home.
Danny Rolling was named a 
suspect nine months later. He was subsequently convicted of the murders.
Rolling’s execution took place 
in 2006.
Dr. Wayne Griffin, associate 
director of the UF Counseling and Wellness Center, also spoke at the service, noting how the re-
siliency of the trees mirrors the 
resiliency of the memory of the five students whose lives were cut short at the hands of a mur -
derer. 
“They have weathered sunny 
days, and they have weathered hurricanes,” Griffin said. “And they stood strong.”4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, AUGUST 27, 2010

Florida was one of 10 states awarded 
federal Race to the Top education grants, 
but Alachua County school board officials 
are unaware of how the county will spend the money. 
On Tuesday, it was announced Florida 
was awarded $700 million after state rep-
resentatives submitted a second 354-page 
application for the grant.
The grant lists a set of goals for schools 
to work toward, including increasing stu-dent scores on national assessment tests, increasing the amount of students earn-ing at least a year of college credit and a decrease in the achievement gap between 
whites and minority groups. 
Alachua County officials are unsure of 
how they will spend the money.
“Right now, we are still in limbo,” said 
Jackie Johnson, Alachua County School 
Board spokeswoman. “We don’t know how much money we are going to receive or what we will be required to spend it on.”
Half of the grant money will be kept by the state and the rest will be divided among counties but not until each has sub-mitted an application. 
“We don’t know if we are going to have 
the flexibility to do anything other than what the grant requires,” Johnson said. 
Depending on the amount 
of money allotted, school 
board officials would like to 
improve teacher training, buy 
more class materials and hire additional teachers. 
County officials would also like to ex-
tend the school day in higher-risk schools to allow for extra FCAT-instruction time, a program they started with The School Im-provement Grant, a previous grant award-
ed to the county, which allots $75,000 each 
year for three consecutive years to Charles W. Duval Elementary, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings Elementary School and Haw-
thorne Middle and High School, Johnson 
said.
But county officials expect to receive 
less money from the Race to the Top funds than the previous grant. 
“Obviously that is a much, much bigger 
amount of money than what we can expect from The Race to the Top grant,” Johnson said. Officials unsure of how grant money will be spent

UF President Bernie Machen delivers his State of the University speech in the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom 
Thursday afternoon. Machen stressed the importance of increasing the university’s international reach.
State funding up six percent; research awards up 18 percent from previous year
the $678 million that UF has 
received in faculty research awards this year, an 18 percent 
boost from the previous year. 
Although $77 million of 
the finances come from fed-
eral stimulus money, Machen 
argued that even without that 
money, the university would still have received more faculty research award money than the $574 million in faculty research 
awards received in the 2008-09 
fiscal year.
Having spent parts of his 
summer traveling in Asia, Ma-
chen also made note of how 
countries like China are pump-ing a stream of resources into their schools to rival those in the United States. 
“In other words, the game is 
changing on us again,” he said. “ And though it won’t happen immediately, if we don’t adapt 
to these new circumstanc-
es, we risk falling behind.”  
Although he acknowledged a push from neighboring univer -sities within the state, Machen 
did not specifically address the 
issue of UF being leap-frogged by the University of Miami in the latest national rankings of 
colleges by U.S. News & World 
Report. 
In a brief interview follow-
ing his address, Machen dis-missed the report, saying that students shouldn’t pay much attention to the numbers, con-
sidering the restraints of re-
sources for public universities.
Instead, Machen said both 
students and faculty should be excited about the upcoming 
year.

at UF,” Machen said. “I’m seri-
ous. I think this is going to be a 
great year.” STATE , from page 1Alachua County sheriff said

A Regional Transit System bus heads east on West University Avenue on Thursday evening. The company surpassed 
its previous record by serving 59,135 passengers Wednesday.

Gainesville’s mass transit has never been more massive.
The city’s Regional Transit System set a record for bus riders 
in a single day Wednesday with 59,135 passengers.
The record tops the previous high of 58,716 set in September 
2009.
“We’re very excited about it,” said RTS spokesman Chip 
Skinner. “Any time we set a record, we’re extremely excited.”
He attributed the record-setting day to the efforts of students 
and residents of Gainesville trying to save money in a tough economy . 
There are 10 buses outfitted with the ability to collect data 
on passengers, he said, but the service did not know the total percentage of the riders who were UF students. They ride the RTS buses for free using their Gator 1 Cards. 
If the trend continues, Skinner said, RTS may reach 9.3 mil-
lion riders this year, which would set a new annual rider record. 
RTS is up 4 percent in riders from last year.
Skinner said with more riders, the federal government could 
increase funding for public transportation. 
He said RTS has, per capita, the highest ridership of any bus 
service in Florida. LOCALThe views expressed here are not necessarily those of the  Alligator .

Today’s question: Are you glad women have the right to vote?Thursday’s question: Have you ever bought a poster at the      annual poster sale?Most practical freshman advice yet
For the past two months, y’all have been subjected to a 
never-ending parade of  “freshman advice” columns 
where writers muster up all the meaningless humani-
tarian niceties and spew them on print in their best imitation 
of Dr. Phil, devoid of anything entertaining or soul-rotting.
For this one, it’s time to bring out Dr. Kevorkian.This upcoming weekend, many of you will be finishing 
off a strong week of playing musical chairs on ISIS while get-
ting completely Schiavoed every night, taking more shots 
to the dome than JFK.  Such goes with the tradition that is drop/add week. 
Unfortunately , a herd of prepubescent cattle is about to 
plague midtown as bright-eyed freshmen, decked out in their extra-small Abercrombie polos and ironic slogan T-
shirts (I don’t care what your chest reads. You are not a test 
subject for an alcohol company or an amateur gynecologist), many for the first time in their lives. 
Now, if you’re one of those prodigy alcoholics who have 
already been liquefying your liver at watering holes since high school who just happened to be cursed with the fact 
that your parents didn’t use the safe word a few years earli-
er, then I welcome you. Hell, if you come up to me and make some obscene joke about Helen Keller or an awesome refer -
ence to “Eastbound and Down” or the “The Big Lebowski,” I just might buy you a drink. I’m talking about the kids who sipped a couple of Smirnoff Ices in high school and think 
they’ve reached the level of David Hasselhoff eating cheese-
burgers from his hotel floor. They’re the ones who need to be roofied and left naked at the front of a monastery . 
However, this rant does not apply to underage girls. 
Watching daddy’s princess, who only a few months ago was getting her prom dress split open by the high school quarter -
back/future Uncle Rico, bust her ass on the urinal is about as funny as seeing Santa Claus get bludgeoned to death in front of a school yard of children. But take this one golden nugget. 
Don’t dull us with your stories of 
being the next Dr. Quinn Medicine 
Woman or the first person to make someone care about the WNBA or 
how all these college guys are “so ma-
ture they can read your soul.”  Shut up, drink your apple martini and 
look pretty . 
Instead, I’m talking about the guys 
who take up space at the bar only to order a “strong” Diet Coke. If you go to a bar on a Friday night and don’t take 
your game to alcoholic stepfather level, you might as well spit on the American flag. Man up, get an ID that says you’re 
“Abdul Aziz Jabbar” and rage. 
Here’s another group of people who should be reincar -
nated as one of Bing Crosby’s kids. Just because the pretty waitress called you sweetheart or puts her hand on your 
shoulder to get past you during happy hour doesn’t mean you have to track her down at every free moment to “spit 
mad game.” You look like a damn circus clown and, more 
importantly , you’re stopping her from getting me another pitcher. Servers, if these jamokes try to woo you with their 
tales of how they stuck it to their driver’s ed teachers in high 
school, tell them kindly that it’s people like them who make you feel Roe v. Wade was a good thing. 
Lastly , if you’re trying to shotgun that Natty Ice you 
snuck into your cargo shorts in the bathroom stall where Brutus the beefcake bouncer can’t find you while I’m ready 
to R. Kelly all over the toilet seat, just take your neck, stick it 
between the door and continue to slam until your soul be-gins to ooze out your nose.

As our beloved drop-add period ends, and as professors 
start to sound more like the teacher from Charlie Brown, we’re given the gift that is our first Gators weekend. 
So soak up the time in the never-ending swamp of rain 
and slush that is Gainesville, Gators! As Mother Nature gets all sassy and refuses to relent with her rain and gloom as she does every August in Gainesville, we can’t help but be a little excited as the Editorial Board presents you with your very own This-Will-Be-Your-Only-Ray-Of-Sunshine-Until-November-Because-It-Never-Stops-Raining-Here-Ever edi-tion of 
Darts & Laurels
And as we talk about a ray of sunshine, we have to admit 
we weren’t on everyone’s good side this week. 
After a computer error (seriously, not our fault) left a 
very unfortunate error on our front page earlier this week comparing sisters of a certain sorority to, let’s just say, a cer -
tain gardening tool, we are more than mortified with our -
selves. But, as we said Thursday, accidents happen. So for our front-page nightmare of a typo, we’re throwing a You-Sure-You-Kiss-Your-Mother-With-That-Mouth-No-But-Seriously-We’re-Really-Sorry DART at The Independent 
Florida Alligator.
Some things are harder to move on from than others. This week marks the 20th anniversary of the start of Dan-
ny Rolling’s murders that rocked Gainesville and UF before some of you were even born. Leaving five people dead and forever marring the lives of the the victims’ families, Rolling left a hideous trail of grief that remains two decades later.
For viciously killing and ruining the lives of countless 
people, we’re aiming a posthumous Nothing-Will-Ever-Make-What-You-Did-Right-In-This-World DART right at 
The Gainesville Ripper’s heart because two decades later, a permanent memorial on 34th Street Wall and yearly me-morials will never bring our fellow Gators and Gainesville residents back.
Conversely, we realize the state of Florida put its game 
face on when it brought a little justice to the victims’ fami-lies and decided to sentence Rolling to death. For showing the nation and the world we do not mess with serial kill-ers sneaking about and killing our students, we’re giving a That’s-How-We-Do-It-In-Florida-But-We-Really-Wish-He-Hadn’t-Killed-Anyone-In-The-First-Place LAUREL to the 
State of Florida for catching and then sentencing Danny Rolling. 
Not as serious as placing Gainesville in a state of looming 
fear, Gainesville was faced with another pesky criminal this summer.
The Skimmer Scammer, as he has become known, plagued 
Gainesville gas stations with intricate devices that steal your personal information from credit card swipes at the pump. Luckily, officials in Orange County have found a man they believe to be the notoriously annoying Skimmer Scammer. 
For putting Gainesville in a state of fear to ever go back 
to the gas station and for just being plain annoying, the De-partment of Darts and Laurels is stealing your information from your credit card and handing you back a We-Hope-Someone-Charges-Thousands-Of-Dollars-Worth-Of-Zoo-books-On-Your-Own-Credit-Card DART to the Skimmer 
Scammer.
See, Gators? Wasn’t that a ray of sunshine in your wet 
and rainy week? Seriously, though, enjoy your first weekend in Gainesville. We’ll see you on Monday.

Personality politics. You have Chavez in Venezuela, 
Kibaki in Kenya, Ahmadinejad in Iran, and Obama in the United States.
 I know grouping Obama with this gang of nefarious 
characters is bound to raise an eyebrow or two. The only point I am making is that these figures enjoy power partly, 
or primarily, because their personalities appeal to voters. It 
is impossible to deny that Obama’s personality was a sig-nificant factor in the 2008 election.
The song went “I’ve got a crush on Obama,” not I’ve 
got a crush on economic revitalization, wealth redistribu-
tion, and health care reform (though that is a song I would 
certainly sing if someone came up with a catchy melody). Obama was “the one.” “The one” is only a slight modifi-
cation of “the chosen one,” putting Obama in a crew with 
Harry Potter and Anakin Skywalker.
Sarah Palin’s resurgence following her departure from her governorship of the state next to Russia is also a factor of personality politics. After clearly demonstrating a lack of insight and awareness of sig-
nificant political issues in the election, many Americans’ respect of the hockey mom heightened to adulation and 
worship. I don’t think after eight more months governing 
Alaska, Sarah Palin gained a great deal of insight with re-spect to state leadership.
Many political scientists argue that as democracies de-
velop, they usually mature in tandem with vibrant political 
parties and institutions that diminish the public’s concern 
with the personality of leadership figures.
 Technocrats often efficiently manage massive bureau-
cracies. As countries develop, their bureaucracies often grow to manage more complex economies and distribute 
increased revenues. As a result of the process of globaliza-tion, markets seem to be developing almost everywhere. 
Will this trend called “the rise of the rest” by Newsweek’s 
Fareed Zakaria and “global flattening” by The New York 
Times’ Thomas Friedman suffocate personality politics?
It certainly doesn’t seem to be happening in the United 
States. This concerns me, and I think it should concern all of us. Our country is faced with complex, difficult problems 
that require insightful, nuanced solutions. Regrettably, our 
electorate seems to care less about delving into specifics 
than adoring or condemning our vibrant political person-
alities. 
Rather than a real debate on global warming, we audit 
the energy use of environmental spokesmen. We’d prefer to question the patriotism of our leaders than discuss security 
policies. Outside the world of James Bond, we all know that 
a lapel pin on a blazer will not prevent another Sept. 11.
Josh Kornfield is a student at the Universty of Miami.Personality politics distract people from political problemsUWireIn Student Senate Tuesday night, the Student Alliance brought forth a resolution to condemn the Quran burn-ing event by the Dove World Outreach Center scheduled 
for Sept. 11. The event is already being protested by many outraged students and has been met with vehement opposi-tion from local and national media groups. The fact that the traditionally open and tolerant city of Gainesville will be the site of such an egregious event is a blight on our community and everyone who lives within it.
Every Gainesville resident should be ashamed of what is 
going to happen Sept. 11. Without question, most students are against such blatant bigotry. Many students at UF are Muslim and are subjected to the Islamophobic rants of the Dove World Outreach Center on a daily basis. However, on Tuesday night, all senators had the opportunity to con-demn such racism and to reach out to Gainesville’s Islamic community. Taking a stance against Quran burning demonstrates to the student body that the senate will not condone such intolerance. By voting 
on this resolution, the Student Senate could have affirmed the inalienable right of Gainesville Muslims to practice their religion without fear. The Student Alliance wanted to dem-onstrate that Gainesville and UF will not stand for backwa-ter intolerance common to an era well past the lives of most members of Student Government. Even UF President Bernie Machen, usually hesitant to take a stand on issues related to student activism, has openly condemned the Quran burn-ing event.
Instead of demonstrating that UF and the Gainesville 
community are no friends to narrow-minded bigots, the par -
ty in power, the Unite Party, refused to even bring the resolu-tion to the floor; citing “dangerous precedent in procedure.”  Such cowardly indecisiveness in the face of blatant bigotry is a disservice to the Student Body. Does “procedure” com-bat the Islamophobia and xenophobia that demeans the city of Gainesville? Does “procedure” demonstrate the outrage felt by students toward the Dove World Outreach Center? 
Instead of hiding behind “procedural matters,” the Unite 
Party could have sent a clear message to the Student Body.  Student Alliance, myself included, will continue to bring up this resolution on the floor of the senate until it is voted on. If some Unite Party senators do not feel this Quran-burn-ing event is an insult to the Student Body and to the city of Gainesville, they will have to vote “No” and not hide be-hind procedure.

About 120 UF Army ROTC ca-
dets turned out to Flavet Field on 
Thursday afternoon to participate in 
the organization’s annual fall dem-onstration.
“It’s one of our best opportuni-
ties to show UF students what we do,” said cadet Capt. Brian Amos, 
who oversees media relations for UF 
ROTC. “It’s a lot more than a recruit-
ing event.”
The demonstration showcased 
clubs within ROTC, including Gator Guard, a formal drill team, and 
Ranger Challenge, which is a com-petitive varsity sports team, said 
Amos, a sports management senior.
A portable rock wall, a Humvee 
and a Black Hawk medevac helicop-
ter — piloted by UF ROTC alumni stationed in Jacksonville — landed on the field near the stage, which 
was surrounded by tents and tables from the Army Reserve and Nation-al Guard.
The UF ROTC tent offered Army 
mouse pads, drink coozies, note-
pads, pens and lanyards. Officers 
stood next to a squad automatic weapon and an MK-19 grenade 
launcher that, Amos said, weighed 120 pounds. The weapons cannot be 
used on campus. 
The purpose of the displays was 
to show new cadets what the mili-
tary has to offer them, said Lt. Haby Ramirez, who graduated from UF in 
December 2009. 
Cadets declare what branch of 
the military they are most interested in by their junior year and are placed 
according to need, GPA, physical 
training score and leadership fac-
tors, Ramirez said. 
In addition to the roughly 120 ca-
dets, about 20 non-cadets attended the demo before rain forced the rock wall and Humvee off the field. The cadets moved to the stage, where 
they stood in formation before being dismissed.8, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, AUGUST 27, 2010

� THE BEAM HAS A MAXIMUM 
RANGE OF 85 FEET.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
LOS ANGELES  — A device designed to 
control unruly inmates by blasting them with 
a beam of intense energy that causes a burn-ing sensation is drawing heat from civil rights groups who fear it could cause serious injury 
and is “tantamount to torture.”
The mechanism, known as an “Assault Intervention Device,” is a stripped-down ver -
sion of a military gadget that sends highly fo-
cused beams of energy at people and makes them feel as though they are burning. The Los 
Angeles County sheriff’s department plans to 
install the device by Labor Day , making it the first time in the world the technology has been deployed in such a capacity.
The American Civil Liberties Union of 
Southern California criticized Sheriff Lee Ba-ca’s decision in a letter sent Thursday, saying that the technology amounts to a ray gun at a county jail. The 4-foot-tall weapon, which looks like a cross between a robot and a satel-
lite radar, will be mounted on the ceiling and 
can swivel.
It is remotely controlled by an operator in 
a separate room who lines up targets with a joystick.
The ACLU said the weapon was “tanta-
mount to torture,” noting that early military versions resulted in five airmen suffering last-ing burns. It requested a meeting with Baca, 
who declined the invitation.
The sheriff unveiled the device last week 
and said it would be installed in the dorm of a jail in north Los Angeles County . It is far less 
powerful than the military version and has various safeguards in place, including a three-second limit to each beam of heat.
The natural response when blasted — to 
leap out the way — would be helpful in bring-ing difficult inmates under control and quell-ing riots, the sheriff said.
But the sheriff was creating a dangerous en-
vironment with “a weapon that can cause seri-ous injury that is being put into a place where there is a long history of abuse of prisoners,” ACLU attorney Peter Eliasberg said. “That is a 
toxic combination.”
Cmdr. Bob Osborne, who oversees tech-
nology for the sheriff’s department, said the 
concerns were unfounded. He said he stood in front of the beam more than 50 times and that it never caused any sort of lasting damage.
“The neat thing with this device is you ex-
perience pain but you are not injured by it,” Osborne said. “It doesn’t injure your skin, the 
beam doesn’t have the power to do that.”
He said the device would be a more hu-
mane way of dealing with jail disturbances. 
Unlike hitting inmates with batons or deploy-ing tear gas, a shot from the beam has no after -
effects, he said.
The device was made specifically for the 
sheriff’s department by Raytheon Missile Sys-tems. Sheriff’s spokesman Steve Whitmore 
said its $750,000 cost was paid for by a Depart-
ment of Justice technology grant.
After a six-month trial, the sheriff will de-
termine if the device is effective and if it should be deployed in other jails.
“When this pilot program is done, the real-
istic hope is it will accomplish not only what the sheriff’s department wants but what the ACLU wants, which is to save lives harmless-
ly,” Whitmore said.
A Raytheon spokesman on Thursday re-
ferred questions to the sheriff’s department, 
but provided a fact sheet describing how the device only penetrates skin to a depth 1/64 of an inch. The military’s version of the device can shoot a beam more than 800 feet but the sheriff’s department model has a maximum range of 85 feet.
Angelica Arias, an attorney with the coun-
ty’s Office of Independent Review, which monitors the sheriff’s department, said only deputies with special training would be able to use the device and a video would be auto-matically recorded each time it is operated.L.A. authorities plan to use heat-beam ray on inmates

 MALES ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE 
HEARING LOSS THAN FEMALES.
By DANIEL DEEP
Alligator Contributing Writer
Kids these days just aren’t hearing the way 
they used to.
According to a study printed in the Journal 
of the American Medical Association, one in 
five teenagers suffers from some level of noise-
induced hearing loss. 
The study compared about 3,000 teenagers 
from 1988 to 1994 to about 1,800 children be-
tween 2005 to 2006. 
The study showed that males were more like-
ly to have hearing loss than females, and those from a poor socioeconomic status were more susceptible to noise-induced hearing loss than individuals from a higher social upbringing.
About 20 percent of the teenagers in the 2005 
to 2006 age group showed signs of hearing loss, indicating a 31 percent increase in the prevalence of hearing loss among teenagers since 1994.
The AMA defines slight hearing loss as a 
15- to 25-decibel decrease of sensitivity. Mild or worse hearing loss is categorized as any amount more than 25 decibels.
Although hearing loss is a preventable condi-
tion, many youth do not know they are losing their hearing as they inflict permanent damage to themselves.
A similar study by the University of Colorado 
at Boulder and the Children’s Hospital Boston determined that up to 24 percent of adolescents 
listen to music at levels that are dangerous.
However, steps can be taken to prevent noise-induced hearing loss, according to UF clinical 
audiologist Shawna Dell.
A large factor in noise-induced hearing loss 
is cultural influences, Dell said. 
For example, concerts, amplifiers, traffic, fire-
works and portable music players all factor into 
the gradual loss of hearing, according to Dell.
“If they continue that behavior, they will lose 
hearing by adulthood,” she said.
Using earplugs or earmuffs during loud ac-
tivities is important to protecting one’s hearing, she said.
The study, headed by Josef Shargorodsky of 
Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, did 
not attempt to suggest a specific cause for the hearing loss.
Listeners can protect their outer hair cells 
from damage by turning down the volume on their music players, Dell said. 
Another rule of thumb, according to re-
searchers of a past UF study, is that if an envi-ronment is so noisy that people have  to signifi-cantly raise their voices to be heard, that noise is ‘loud enough that it risks hurting your ability to hear.’
Once a significant number of those  hair cells 
die, they stop growing, which damages hear -
ing.
“It is a cognizant choice,” Dell said. “You 
choose to expose yourself to noise. Prevention is the key.”FRIDAY, AUGUST 27, 2010  ALLIGATOR, 9

DENVER — Supreme Court Justice Sonia 
Sotomayor predicted Thursday that the na-
tion’s high court will be asked again to weigh issues of national security versus free speech because of the recently leaked classified war documents posted on the WikiLeaks website.
Sotomayor told high-school and college 
students at the University of Denver that she couldn’t answer a student question about the security questions and free speech because “that question is very likely to come before me.”
The release of the WikiLeaks documents, 
which included names of Afghans working with American forces, has been blasted by the Pentagon. It said the publication of those documents put lives at risk, while WikiLeaks employees insisted the website provides a public service for whistleblowers.
Sotomayor said Thursday that the “inci-dent, and others, are going to provoke legis-lation that’s already being discussed in Con-gress, and so some of it is going to come up before (the Supreme Court).”
She added that the balance between na-
tional security and free speech is “a constant struggle in this society, between our security needs and our First Amendment rights, and one that has existed throughout our history.”
Sotomayor compared the current question 
to the debate over allowing publication of the Pentagon Papers, a secret Pentagon study about the Vietnam War. The New York Times published those in 1971 after the Supreme Court declined to block their publication over the objections of the Pentagon.
“That was not beginning of that question, 
but an issue that keeps arising from genera-tion to generation, of how far we will permit government restriction on freedom of speech in favor of protection of the country,” Soto-mayor said. “There’s no black-and-white line.”Sotomayor also declined to take a position 
on Arizona’s illegal immigration law, but said the question of illegal immigration will be de-cided by legislation, not the courts.
“I haven’t really examined the Arizona 
law in detail ... so I haven’t formed an opin-ion yet, and I wouldn’t until I heard the case,” Sotomayor told a Latino boy who asked the question.
Sotomayor didn’t predict whether it would 
end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. Parts 
of Arizona’s law are pending in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco after the Department of Jus-
tice sued.
Sotomayor told students that if they were 
interested in changing society, they need to look to the legislative branch, not the courts.
“Waiting for the courts to resolve these is-
sues is not what all of you should be doing,” Sotomayor said, adding that they have to “work hard at either passing laws that you think do the right thing, or changing those laws which you think do the wrong thing.”Sotomayor discussed her personal experi-
ences as a top arbiter of the law, saying she has been “living a fantasy” since being ap-pointed to the court last year but that the job requires sacrifice.
She said her greatest sacrifice was “taking 
this job when I know I’m on the tail end of my mother’s life.” She said her mother was hospitalized two days ago in Florida, “and I’m not there.”
Sotomayor spoke to the students before 
her appearance at a judicial conference in Col-orado Springs this weekend. Some 800 judges are expected at the 10th U.S. Circuit Court conference; Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bad-er Ginsburg planned to speak there.
A student asked about Sotomayor’s expe-
rience living in her hometown, the Bronx bor -
ough of New York City, then attending Princ-eton University in New Jersey. The justice joked that students at the Ivy League school had read books she’d never even heard of and took a swipe at “Ulysses” by James Joyce.
“I started to read it, and I almost fell 
asleep,” Sotomayor said.

Gators midfielder Tahnai Annis was named the SEC Offensive Player of the Week after scoring two goals in the sec-
ond half of UF’s win against UCF on Sunday. She will try to continue her hot streak tonight against Florida Atlantic.
Florida looks to stay unbeaten tonight against FAU
By JESSE SIMONTON
Alligator Writer
 
Two down, three to go. 
After defeating two in-state rivals to begin the season, No. 
9 Florida will try to down another in-state opponent when it 
hosts Florida Atlantic tonight at 6. The Owls (0-1) are the third 
of five Florida schools the Gators (2-0) face in the early part of their schedule. 
Sunday’s home match against San Diego State (1-1) is the 
only out-of-state school UF plays until Sept. 17.
Florida got off to a perfect start with a home overtime win 
against Miami and a road victory against then-No. 25 UCF, 
defeating the Knights 2-0 in front of a record crowd of 2,141. 
Junior forward Tahnai Annis supplied the fire power with two second-half goals.
“We knew UCF was going to be tough at home in their sea-
son opener,” UF coach Becky Burleigh said. “I thought we re-ally took control of the game in the first half of the second half and capitalized on our early chances.”
Annis’ two-goal effort earned her Southeastern Conference 
Offensive Player of the Week honors and helped 
the Gators jump two spots in the national rank-ings. 
This is the fourth meeting between Florida 
and FAU. The Gators last faced the Owls in 2008 in Boca Raton, where Annis, then a fresh-man, netted her first career goal to hand UF a 
2-1 overtime win.
The Gators thought they were seeing déjà vu this season 
when this year’s freshman-phenom Taylor Travis followed in 
her footsteps with a game-winning goal in overtime against 
Miami.
The two games this weekend for the Gators offer a range in 
extremes, as they face a weakened FAU team that was picked to finish ninth in the Sun Belt Conference and the reigning 
Mountain West Conference Champs in San Diego State. 
“We have got two different games this weekend,” Burleigh 
said. “San Diego State won their conference, and I think they 
will be a very good opponent. FAU is a team that is in a re-
building year, but that’s a hard team to play against because 
they are really well-organized and well-coached.”
Despite its deficiencies, Burleigh expects FAU to show up 
strong, saying, “they’ll defend hard and make it tough.”SoccerSports

POLL QUESTION UF BASKETBALL TEEING OFF WITH TYLER JETTBy MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator.org
 
Florida will likely be without three key players for its season 
opener against Miami (Ohio) next weekend.
UF coach Urban Meyer said offensive tackles Xavier Nixon 
and Matt Patchan are both out, while starting tight end Jordan 
Reed’s status is less certain.
“We thought we lost [Reed], but he only has a deep knee 
bruise,” Meyer said. “That’s a pain tolerance thing, so we don’t 
know when we’ll get him back.”
Meyer said he wasn’t sure whether his tackles would be 
healthy in time for the Sept. 11 game against USF. Nixon had  
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee, and a pin was inserted into Patchan’s fractured right wrist.
Center Mike Pouncey said this week he wouldn’t be sur -
prised if he played tackle because of injuries on the line, but Meyer is against that plan.
“I was opposed to that because in the first game I want the 
ball to hit the quarterback in the hands and not look like “The 
Bad News Bears” out there,” Meyer said.
Meanwhile, two players will switch positions to fill in for 
Reed. Receiver Omarius Hines and quarterback Trey Burton will take over the hybrid tight end 
role formerly occupied by Aaron Hernandez if 
Reed is out.
BROWN IN LEAD FOR NO. 2 CORNER 
SPOT: The corner position opposite Janoris Jenkins appears to be Jeremy Brown’s for the 
taking.
Meyer said Brown would start at either corner or nickelback 
next Saturday , depending on which defensive formation the 
Gators come out in.
Brown and Moses Jenkins are competing for the starting gig, 
and freshman Matt Elam will also see time at nickel, a package Meyer said he expects to use frequently.
Before Brown could earn playing time, he had to prove the 
back injury that kept him out for two years was a thing of the 
past.
“Jeremy is doing really good,” Meyer said. “He’s healthy 
and full speed now. We kind of, I don’t want to say babied him, 
but we watched him during two-a-days. He’s full-tilt now, and 
it makes you feel good to see that guy go like that.”
THEY’RE GOOD: Meyer didn’t have much to say about 
the rumors and reports that swirled around freshmen Ronald 
Powell and Dominique Easley on Wednesday . The Alligator 
first reported both missed Tuesday’s practice and considered 
transferring, but Meyer wasn’t in the mood to confirm or deny those details, only saying that the two missed “part of practice” 
on Tuesday.
He answered multiple questions about the pair by simply 
saying, “They’re good.”
KEEPING IT IN THE FAMILY: Mike Pouncey was named 
to the Rimington Trophy watch list Thursday , an honor given to the nation’s best center at season’s end.
Last year, his brother, Maurkice, became the first UF player 
to win the award. Mike Pouncey collected a few accolades of his own in 2009, being named a second-team All-American and first-team All-Southeastern Conference selection by The Asso-
ciated Press.
LOTS OF LINEBACKERS: When asked to name his three 
starting linebackers, Meyer spat out A.J. Jones, Brandon Hicks, Jon Bostic, Jelani Jenkins and Lorenzo Edwards. 
“Those are our three,” he joked.He also said freshman Neiron Ball would see playing time 
this year.
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF offensive tackle Xavier Nixon will miss the season opener against Miami (Ohio) on Sept. 4. after undergoing 
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee.
Nixon, Patchan to miss first game with injuries
Trey Burton. Remember that name.
He won’t have a Bible verse on his 
eye black, and you probably won’t  
see many fans wearing his jersey, but he 
could deliver a jump pass and a quarter -
back run or two.
The freshman quarterback’s versatil-
ity will be the closest thing to Tim Tebow you’re going to get.
If you thought the freshman version of 
Tebow was fun to watch, you haven’t seen anything yet.Burton is expected line up as tight end 
while also acting as the catalyst for the popular wildcat package. 
“He’s playing it all,” offensive coordi-
nator Steve Addazio said. “He is a play-maker. He’s a total ball player. He lines up, takes snaps, direct runs and is playing 
that hip-slash-fullback-flex-out guy. He 
can do a lot of things. It’s pretty amazing, really.”
The 6-foot-2, 222-pound quarterback 
provides the trait the spread offense needs to survive in Gainesville: a match-up nightmare.
Let’s break down 
the mismatches Bur -
ton will create.
First and foremost, 
he will be utilized as a quarterback in short-yardage and goal-line 
situations for one reason — to run the ball. The days of pounding the signal-caller up the middle and predictable play-calling will still be around this season at UF.
Burton will single-handedly keep this 
alive. Addazio loves calling those quar -
terback runs, and the freshman will excel at them — giving the offense something it won’t get from starter John Brantley.
Tight end will be the second spot where 
Burton will see time, but he won’t be of the traditional variety. Coaches say he will play in the “Aaron Hernandez position.”
Do you miss Tebow? If so, Burton will help you with that this seasonFootball

Middle blocker Lauren Bledsoe and the Gators will begin their season 
against top competition in Omaha, Neb. 
� THE GATORS ARE REPLAC-
ING 2009 STARTERS ELYSE CUSACK AND COLLEEN WARD. 
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
 
This offseason, the Gators 
were asked many questions re-
garding the departure of Elyse 
Cusack and the arrival of a new defense taught by first-year as-sistant coach Dave Boos. 
No. 13 Florida will get its first 
chance to answer them when it begins its season this weekend at the Runza/AVCA Showcase in Omaha, Neb. 
As if replacing the Southeast-
ern Conference’s all-time digs leader and learning a new de-fense wasn’t hard enough, the team will reveal its new look 
against No. 9  Iowa State at 3 p.m. 
on Saturday and No. 2 Nebraska at 5:30 p.m. on Sunday.
“This tournament has histori-
cally been the premier opening-weekend tournament in women’s volleyball, and we’re fortunate that we’ve had opportunities to play in it [before],” coach Mary 
Wise said. 
“The added bonus besides the 
great history of the tournament 
is playing two top-10 teams in a 
great volleyball environment, in a state that really loves its vol-
leyball.”
Participating in the tourna-
ment for the fifth time, the Gators return five starters from the 2009 season, when they went 25-6 and finished ranked No. 15. 
Last season marked the first 
time in Wise’s 19 years at Flori-da that the team did not win the SEC title.
A demanding non-conference 
schedule might be just what the team needs to get back atop the SEC.
“We’ve tried to schedule as 
difficult of a (nonconference) 
schedule as we could each year, Wise said. “It sort of lined up 
all at once this 
year.
“We will 
know a whole lot more about our 
team on Sunday night by playing 
these two quality opponents than we would know if we hadn’t. 
“In these type of matches, you 
can learn so much about your 
team, win or lose, that will help 
us for when truly the season be-gins at Kentucky in September.”
As the Gators prepare to open 
the season in Omaha, there are still uncertainties surrounding the offense after last season’s starting outside hitter, Colleen Ward, transferred in the offsea-son.
“There’s times when we have 
everybody on the same page that we’re doing some good things, but I feel like our offense has a long way to go,” Wise said. 
“What we’d like to do is get to 
the point where we could be a re-ally consistent [defensive] team. Right now, we’re not there. 
“It may take some time in 
terms of getting the passers used to passing with each other, the rhythm between the setters and the hitters — there is a lot of that 
still to be accomplished.”
One thing for certain is that 
the players are ready to stop 
scrimmaging and play teams that aren’t wearing orange and blue.
“The competition is really 
what we play for,” senior Lau-ren Bledsoe said. “We’re athletes and we like to compete. This is 
really beneficial for us to have re-
ally good competition preseason, postseason and during the con-ference. I’d rather have that any day than an easy schedule.”
This weekend will not be the 
easiest of season openers. How-ever, a good showing can set the tone for the rest of the year.
“If we can do well this week-
end,” Bledsoe said, “it would be a great preview to what we can do the rest of the season.” 
UF opens year with matches against two top-10 teams
Volleyball
While this may be true, Burton will 
probably do less blocking than Hernandez 
because of his inexperience with that facet 
of the job. He will act as more of a hybrid 
tight end that lines up anywhere from the outside to the backfield, and he’ll be a load for most linebackers and defensive backs to handle.
The final role he could assume is on the 
kickoff return team, where Meyer men-tioned Burton as a possible lead blocker for Jeff Demps. 
Burton’s combination of size and speed 
allows him to act as the primary blocker but also handle the ball if need be.
I know, this all sounds outlandish. A 
freshman quarterback acting as a goal-line threat, a tight end and a lead blocker on special teams is not usually ideal, but in this case it works.
“We thought he was a real good [re-
cruit], but he’s doing a little better right now.,” Meyer said. “He ‘s so versatile and he’s so football smart. You tell him one 
time and it’s done.”
No, he wasn’t describing the freshman 
version of Tebow. This statement was 
about Burton.
You’ll notice the similarities between 
the two. Just wait.ANTHONY , from page 19
