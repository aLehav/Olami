For more than 20 years, Wayne Wallace helped build the 
UF Career Resource Center from the ground up to become 
one of the best university career service centers in the na-tion.
After he became the center’s director in 1990, Wallace 
helped job-seeking students connect with companies and helped move the center from its original ofﬁ  ce in the Reitz Union basement to a ﬁ  rst-ﬂ  oor suite. He retired in January 2011.In early June, Wallace underwent what was supposed to 
be a routine surgery for diverticulitis, a di-gestive disease found in the large intestine. Doctors instead found pancreatic cancer.
On Tuesday morning, Wallace died 
from complications with the cancer at Shands Cancer Hospital at UF. He was 66 
years old.
Friends and coworkers described Wal-
lace as a “natural leader” and a mentor.
“He loved his employment, he loved his purpose at the 
university, and he loved his employees,” said Grant Thrall, a retired UF business geography professor and a close friend to Wallace. “Most importantly, he loved what he was doing for students.”
The Alligator was not able to reach Wallace’s wife.Born in Chicago, Wallace grew up in Hammond, Ind., 
with his three siblings and parents, who were both deaf, Thrall said.
In 1972, Wallace ﬁ  rst began working in career services 
when he became an assistant director of career planning and placement at Miami University in Ohio.
He later started working as the director of Indiana Uni-The Jones is opening a new

Florida Agricultural and 
Mechanical University Presi-
dent James Ammons resigned Wednesday following a hazing death and several other issues.
FAMU drum major Robert 
Champion, 26, died in Novem-ber after being beaten by his bandmates in a hazing ritual.
It was later discovered that 
more than 100 members of the band weren’t FAMU students. Other problems the university has lately faced are an investi-gation of fraud in the band’s ﬁ  -nances and issues with accredi-tation and graduation rates, according to Alligator archives.
Parents, students and ad-
ministrators have been calling for Ammons’ resignation for months. In June, he received a vote of no conﬁ  dence from FA-MU’s Board of Trustees.
Ammons will ofﬁ  cially leave 
his position Oct. 11.
“I am determined to move 
all of the major challenges to-ward resolution and move our university toward success,” he wrote in a letter to FAMU’s Board of Trustees. “When the next president experiences her or his transition in, she or he will very likely ﬁ  nd additional challenges, albeit not nearly to the extent of that which l faced at the outset, or those I am now facing.”
Board of Governors chair-
man Dean Colson said in a statement that the Board of Governors has committed to assist FAMU’s Board of Trust-ees in resolving those issues.

Budget cuts will force Library West to absorb the collections 
of two other libraries that are closing.
Collections from the Allen H. Neuharth Journalism and 
Communications Library, which is already closed, will be 
housed in the six-story facility by fall.The Music Library will close in January. There is no project-
ed completion date for moving its collection into Library West.
LeiLani Freund, a reference librarian at Library West, said 
the library administration is already preparing for the shift. Li-brary staffers are currently allocating space on each ﬂ  oor for the collections.
The collections will be assimilated into normal library cir-
culation based on the call numbers, Freund said. However, cir-culation records and online catalog information will need to be changed.
She said the project is extensive, so Library West may be hir-
ing temporary employees or work study students if the budget allows.
The journalism library was closed for renovations at the end 
of Spring semester.
“We expected the library to open again after the renovations, 
but due to the budget cuts it was closed down permanently ,” Freund said.
The project should not affect student mobility or concentra-
tion during library hours, she said.UF journalism and music library collections moving

Yoga teacher fired for glaring at 
Facebook worker
MENLO PARK, Calif. — A 
California yoga instructor has 
been fired for her disapproving stink-eye glare at a Facebook employee using a cellphone in class.
Alice Van Ness, who was 
hired to teach hour-long yoga sessions at Facebook’s Menlo Park campus, says she tells stu-dents before class to turn off their cellphones.
But a female employee pulled been killed in the crash, and he sought $20,000 in compensation.
Authorities say Samsonov 
submitted photos of a cat, but an insurance representative found that the pictures had come from the Internet.
If convicted, Samsonov could 
get a year behind bars.

Man accidentally eats steel 
bristle during BBQ
TACOMA, Wash.  — A Taco-
ma man needed emergency sur -
gery after accidentally eating a 
steel bristle from a grill brush he used during a barbeque.
KING 5 reports that Adam 
Wojtanowicz went to the hospi-tal Sunday complaining of ab-dominal pain that wouldn’t go away despite his taking medi-cation. Doctors found a metal bristle on a CT scan and per -
formed surgery to get it out.
Wojtanowicz says he recently 
hosted a cookout, and he thinks a steel bristle from his grill brush fell onto his steak. He says he apparently swallowed the metal without realizing it.
The Centers for Disease Con-
trol says it knows of at least six people who have recently suf-fered similar, potentially fatal, injuries. It doesn’t blame a par -
ticular brand or type of brush.
Wojtanowicz is expected to 
recover.

‘Boared’ piggy goes to bank in 
Austria
VIENNA — Piggy bank has a 
new meaning in a town east of 
Vienna after a surveillance cam-era caught a wild pig on a night foray to a local branch of one of Austria’s financial institutions.
The Austria Press Agency re-
ports that the inquisitive porker managed to push open a locked sliding glass door of a bank in Hainburg an der Donau to make its way inside. After look-ing around, it left the same way it came without causing sig-nificant damage, with the door locking behind it.
APA, in its report Wednes-
day, said bank officials became suspicious last month after a member of the early morn-ing cleaning staff noticed large smear marks on the door. A review of surveillance footage identified the unusual visitor.

dle of a Monday session and began texting.
The San Jose Mercury 
News says Van Ness didn’t say anything, but she gave the student what she calls a look of disapproval.
The student later com-

The termination letter says 
Van Ness “made a spectacle” of the student.

LAKEWOOD, Wash. — A 
Washington state woman says 
she was attacked and bitten by raccoons after her dog chased several of the animals up a tree.
Michaela Lee had just fin-
ished jogging in Lakewood’s Fort Steilacoom Park on Mon-day when her dog got loose. When she went to grab the dog’s leash, several other rac-coons started to scratch her legs, chased her for about 75 feet, knocked her down and bit her.
Neighbor Michael Parks 
tells The News Tribune he heard Lee screaming and saw her on the ground. He called 911. Two other neighbors also went to help. Lee says her American dingo dog began barking and helped drive the raccoons off.
The 28-year-old Lee was 
treated for about 16 puncture wounds and had numerous scratches.

� HE HOPES TO END CHILD 
HUNGER IN GAINESVILLE.
JAVIER EDWARDS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Somewhere in Gainesville, there 
is a child too hungry to pay attention 
to the teacher standing in the front of the classroom.
His tummy is rumbling and his 
throat is dry. His eyes are fixed, but he isn’t listening. He can’t seem to erase the big potato chip on the can-vas of his imagination.
His mother works 40 hours a 
week and he doesn’t see his dad too often. Mommy doesn’t always have time to pack a lunch. They don’t al-ways have food.
He sees the other kids with their 
lunchboxes and considers the un-imaginable: steal or starve.
Gainesville humanitarian Den-
nis “DiscoDen” Franklin said he be-lieves there are more than 300 chil-dren just like the one he described, in Gainesville and the surrounding region, fighting for survival.These children continually mo-
tivate him to keep managing the Neighborhood Project, a one-man community restoration project built to make a difference in the lives of local families and individuals.
Franklin is looking for under -
graduate and graduate student vol-unteers, graphic designers, student organizations and anyone with com-passion who can help him operate and build on the programs within the Neighborhood Project.
V olunteers are invited to stop by 
the project’s headquarters at The Ba-zaar, 1620 SE Hawthorne Road. It’s open from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Monday through Friday.
With volunteer help, Franklin 
said he could spend more time com-municating with major sponsors in order to finance programs for the Neighborhood Project.    
Current sponsors include Best 
Buy Co. Inc., Walgreen Co., PepsiCo Inc., Coca-Cola Co., Big Lots and Big Brothers Big Sisters of Mid-Florida, of which Franklin is a board mem-ber.
“These people need help,” he said. “White, black, old or young, they all need help.”
Franklin’s objective is to raise 
people’s attitudes from pessimism to hope.
He said people constantly focus 
on what they don’t have or that they are living from paycheck to pay-check. They complain about how unemployment is about to run out, among other things.
Franklin said he is looking for 
a change in mentality . He hopes to provide all the resources necessary to do so.
“There is too much gimmie-gim-
mie in society ,” he said. “You can’t depend on the government forever. At some point, you’re going to have to get up and make things happen on your own. That is what I want to get to people.”
Included in the Neighborhood 
Project is HOUSING4FAMILIES, a program for helping very low-in-come families, the elderly , veterans and the disabled to afford decent, safe and sanitary housing in the private market, said Bruce Wilson, customer relations specialist at The Bazaar.
The project offers a job train-
ing and employment program that trains individuals for employment and places them in livable-wage jobs, he said.
Also featured are financial litera-
cy workshops, talent searches, health and fitness training, an after-school program, a mentoring program and a neighborhood food bank.
“We are all slaves to habits. 
Peoples’ minds need to be repro-grammed,” he said. “If we are slaves to habits, why not teach people to be slaves to good habits?”
The food bank operates out of 
The Bazaar. The bank strives to ensure that individuals’ and fami-lies’ basic needs are met with fresh meats, fish, fruits and vegetables, Wilson said.
Franklin said he has seen a vari-
ety of demographics visit the food bank. He said the group that fre-quents the bank the most has been “the poor middle-class resident.”
These people reside mostly in 
low socioeconomic neighborhoods, have housing and jobs, but are still barely making enough to support themselves and their families, he said.
The food bank has served more 
than 2,600 residents in the last two months, Franklin said. Some have been recent college graduates hav-ing a hard time getting a job.    
“I want to show people how to 
be successful. It’s a step-by-step pro-cedure,” Franklin said. “The more you help others, the more you help yourself.”

Kristen Stoner isn’t in your face asking if you’re 
registered to vote or handing out ﬂ  iers. People  just 
come to her.
On the Reitz Union Colonnade, Stoner’s orange 
and blue jewelry creations catch the eyes of sneak-ered parents dangling canvas Preview totes, a man in a tie eating a Burger King Whopper and students in sunglasses sipping on Starbucks.
Stoner, 39, said she makes about $500 a day 
selling homemade jewelry at the Reitz. Summer is prime time because of all the parents on campus.
This time, her proﬁ  ts go to the UF ﬂ  ute ensemble 
she advises as a professor in the School of Music. But on gamedays at the United Downtown festival and other events, she keeps the money.
She’s not bored sitting at a table from 8 a.m. until 
4 p.m. She can always play Words with Friends on her iPhone. It’s the wind that gets on her nerves.
The wind blows over a wooden across the walk-
way and ﬂ  aps Stoner’s black velvet tablecloth. The earrings make a light clinking sound.
Her beads and trinkets, tiny metal gators and an-
chors and music notes, plastic dice and peace signs, feathers, glass beads and colored stones, are im-ported from Asia and South America, Stoner said.
Stoner’s display of 600 pieces has taken time to 
collect. Some of them she made last night, and some she crafted two or three years ago.
“You made all of these?” customers ask.“I know, I know,” Stoner said, her blue eyes roll-
ing behind her red-framed glasses. “Crazy.”Music professor sells jewelry

UF’s College of Education will 
launch a new cutting-edge class-
room in hopes of bringing educa-tion into the 21st century.
Room 2309 in Norman Hall 
will be made over with state-of-the-art educational technology by summer 2013.
The college received a $141,000 
grant from UF’s Office of Aca-demic Technology  supported by student technology fees.
Touch-screen SMART interac-
tive whiteboards will comple-ment the standard dry-erase boards. 
Seven mobile media pods out-
fitted with iPads or laptop com-puters will facilitate classroom group work.
The classroom’s media pods 
will connect to a large screen, allowing students to share their individual screens on 40-inch monitors at each end of the class-room.
“The importance is not the 
technology, but how you use technology to model 21st century skills of collaboration, problem solving, creativity, research and critical thinking,” said Suzanne Colvin, associate director of teacher education in the School of Teaching and Learning.   
Incorporating student input 
into the educational process will empower students and increase their willingness to learn, she said.
Lauren Vivar, a 21-year-old el-
ementary education senior, said the use of technology is essential in today’s world.
“Students are much more like-
ly to participate when technol-ogy is involved,” she said. “The classroom will also give learners another way to gather new infor-mation.”
Vivar said she believes teach-
ers need to know how to use tech-nology, and the new classroom will help equip future teachers with the right skills for when they go into the school system.
Colvin said she hopes the re-
invented classroom will serve as a prototype for other depart-ments at UF.
“The ultimate goal for the 
classroom would be to function as a model for how to improve instruction and increase active learning on the part of students all over campus,” she said.Norman Hall will get

UF seniorversity Bloomington’s career re-
source center in 1977.  
In 1990, former UF president 
John Lombardi offered Wallace a director position for career ser-vices at UF, which he accepted af-ter some persuasion by Lombardi, Thrall said.
During his time as director, 
Wallace led the center to its rank-ing of No. 1 and No. 4 on The Princeton Review’s annual “Best Career Services” list for 2010 and 2011, respectively.
Heather White, who worked 
with Wallace for seven years 
before replacing him as the new center director in 2011, described Wallace as a man with a playful sense of humor, intelligence and a drive to inspire his staff to be-come leaders.
“He wanted the career center 
to be the best, and in order for the career service to be the best, we needed to be the best,” she said.
White added that under Wal-
lace’s direction, she and 14 other former staff members have gone on to become directors of career resource centers at universities across the United States, includ-ing the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Purdue University and Carnegie Mellon University.
Shortly before retiring, Wal-
lace was inducted into the Na-tional Association of Colleges and Employers’ Academy of Fellows, which has selected fewer than 30 members nationally since 1994.
Apart from his staff, White 
said Wallace cared about helping students find jobs and better their futures.
Thrall said Wallace’s involve-
ment with Career Showcase, a job fair held at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center, has helped expose thousands of students to internship and job opportunities each spring and fall.
Wallace has also worked with 
the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce to connect students with opportunities to work in the city.
“He was very supportive of 
connecting the university to the local community and especially for internships,” White said.
Outside the office, Wallace 
was known to be an automobile and motorcycle enthusiast.
Growing up near factories 
outside of Chicago, Wallace’s in-terest flourished. When he was 16 years old, Wallace purchased his first motorcycle, a 1962 Harley-Davidson XLCH Sportster, Thrall said.
Thrall and Wallace often par -
ticipated in weekend motorcycle rides with UF faculty and admin-istrators.
On the road, Wallace drove his 
electric blue 2007 Harley-David-son Street Glide while wearing a black helmet with checkered stripes racing down the center, which distinguished him from the pack, Thrall said.
Wallace also owned an orange 
2007 Chevrolet C6 Corvette, re-flecting his joint passion for auto-mobiles and UF.
Wallace was an avid traveler 
who often went on extensive trips with his wife, Victoria.
White said Wallace’s experi-
ence with traveling led him to organize an exchange program with career resource center staff members at UF and the Univer -
sity of Leeds in England.
“For us to be able to travel 
and see how career centers run in other countries and to also help-ing students to be global-minded was something that [Wallace] definitely supported because he traveled so much,” she said.
As part of Wallace’s request, 
there will not be a funeral.
His remains will be taken to 
his home in Indiana, leaving be-hind a legacy that made UF’s cen-ter a leader in the field of career services.
“I don’t know if he realized 
how much of an impact he left in the field and on people’s lives,” White said. 
“I think that’s something that 
a lot of people strive to do in their careers and their lives,” she said. “He was able to do that.”

A UF study has found evidence that 
alcohol is the primary gateway drug that 
can result in use of more dangerous sub-stances.
Alcohol can be the first step toward sub-
stance use, said Adam Barry, an assistant professor and researcher in the College of Health and Human Performance.
“By preventing alcohol initiation, we 
can prevent initiation into other substanc-es,” he said.
The UF study was based on data from 
a separate 2008 Monitoring the Future study. Information collected from 14,577 U.S. high school seniors was used to deter -
mine if they had used any of 11 regulated and illicit drugs.
Barry said UF researchers made the cor -
relation between alcohol and other drug use by using a Guttman scale with survey respondents. For each of the 11 drugs the students had used, they were given one point on the 11-point scale.
The researchers were then able to pre-
dict what drugs each student had used based only on their score and how com-mon use of each drug was.
“A student that scored three points 
would have probably used alcohol, ciga-rettes and marijuana,” Barry said. “We found that we were able to predict re-sponses with about 92 percent accuracy.”
According to the Monitoring the Future 
study, more than 70 percent of the 12th-grade students surveyed reported con-suming alcohol.
According to GatorWell Health Promo-
tion Services’ Core Alcohol and Drug Sur -
vey from Fall 2011, 80.2 percent of the UF students surveyed consumed alcohol in the past year.
“There is usually an initial experimenta-
tion with more socially acceptable drugs,” Barry said. “You’re not going to go to a bar and see someone shooting up heroin.”
The study also found that students who 
drink can be 16 times more likely to use regulated and illicit substances.
Barry said the study’s findings could 
be used by parents and grade schools to prevent illicit substance use. He supports a zero-tolerance policy toward alcohol.
“The longer you can fend off alcohol 
use, the longer you can fend off the use of other substances,” he said.

we can prevent initiation into other 
substances.”

In case anyone forgot, there’s a presidential election

next week.Obama still to blame for state of economy
After reading the response column by UF alumnus 
William Deich maintaining that President Obama was not responsible for the state of the economy , I 
wanted to make a few things clear.
First, I didn’t accuse Obama of causing every problem he 
faces — I accused him of making things worse through his utter incompetence at his job. There is a distinct difference.
Next, Deich asserts that the economy is actually the fault 
of Speaker of the House John Boehner, who ascended to the Speakership after the 2010 midterm elections.
To address this claim, consider the fact that Obama’s 
stimulus plan was projected by his own White House Coun-cil of Economic Advisers to have brought the unemployment rate below 6 percent by now. This same body also projected that by simply doing nothing and allowing markets to ab-sorb their losses, the unemployment number would likewise have fallen below 6 percent.
Instead, unemployment continued to skyrocket. Despite 
entering ofﬁ  ce with a bulletproof Democratic supermajority , Democratic possession of both houses of Congress and colos-sal personal popularity ratings, the economy still managed to nosedive beyond expectations under Obama’s stewardship.
Boehner actually became the speaker of the house in a 
historic sweep as a direct result of the American people’s displeasure at the failure of Obama’s policies. The fact that the president was lampooned for sheepishly joking that his stimulus jobs “weren’t so shovel-ready after all” speaks vol-umes in this regard.
The notion that the president can institute better employ-
ment through “jobs bills” is a political sleight of hand fooling only the naïve. His bill, the American Jobs Act, requires sup-porters to be willfully blind to the economic realities of small business ownership.
For instance, the provisions in sections 101 and 102, which 
provide temporary tax breaks and temporary tax credits to employers in exchange for permanently hiring new workers, are laughable. No employer can afford to invest permanently on the basis of temporary incen-tives. Employment will take place only when the gains from doing so exceed the costs of the taxes and regulations of the deal. Still, Obama seems clueless as to how this actually makes the situation more tenuous for employers and actually discourages more hiring.
And what about the Simpson-Bowles Commission on 
Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, the bipartisan panel in-stituted by the president himself to ﬁ  nd economic solutions and whose recommendations were all rejected by the presi-dent out of hand? Why form the commission at all? Under Obama, our national debt has increased by $5 trillion. To put this into perspective, supposing Christ was born in 3 B.C., and that year you began spending $1 million daily, you still wouldn’t reach $1 trillion until the year 2736. How is this re-sponsible?
Finally, there is the matter of campaign and fundraising 
travel expenses. Deich asserts that Obama has reimbursed more for campaign travel than Bush did. This is highly mis-leading. Although the Obama campaign has reimbursed the taxpayers to the tune of $1.5 million for some campaign-re-lated travel, the White House has made an end run around Government Accountability Ofﬁ  ce complaints by stating that if one leg of a trip is ofﬁ  cial business, then making campaign stops in three additional states along the way is perfectly ac-ceptable, as recorded in USA Today on April 26.
For a president who likes to wag his ﬁ  nger in the faces of 
CEOs, he is certainly eager to mobilize apologists to protect him from responsibility for his own pathetic executive per-formance. I, for one, am getting pretty tired of hearing how “the buck stops … uh, over there.” Aren’t you?

HIV tests with quicker re-
sults will soon become avail-
able for adults to take home.
The Food and Drug Admin-
istration approved OraQuick Rapid HIV test kit, a self-ad-ministered HIV test. The test will be available to people 17 and older  by October.
The over-the-counter kit 
collects an oral ﬂ  uid sample by swabbing the upper and lower gums, according to an FDA press release. Users can expect results within 20 to 40 minutes.
Gay Koehler-Sides, a senior 
human services program man-ager from the Alachua County Health Department, said she thinks the take-home test is im-portant because it gives people who are afraid to go to their doctor or clinic the option to take the test in the privacy of their own homes.
“Even though we still offer 
anonymous testing in the state, there are still people who are afraid,” Koehler-Sides said.
As simple and easy as it 
sounds, the new test comes with its share of problems.Studies on OraQuick found 
it has a 92 percent test sensitiv-ity of detecting when HIV is present and positive, but has one false negative result out of every 12 tests and one false positive result in every 5,000 tests, according to the press re-lease.
“It’s not as sensitive as other 
testing technology that we have available so we may have some people out there who think they’re not infected when they truly are,” Koehler-Sides said.
She also stressed the im-
portance of understanding the “window period” when taking any HIV test.
Koehler-Sides said the anti-
bodies formed by the virus take up to three months to develop and a person who is recently tested after having intercourse will not know if they are in-fected until the time period is over.
Samantha Evans, a sexual 
health educator with UF Ga-torWell Health Promotion Services, said she thinks it’s important people are educated on the three month “window period” and know that support services are available to people who might be distraught after learning their results at home.

SALT LAKE CITY — The may-
or of Murray has put all 18 inches 
of his handlebar mustache up for a Fourth of July vote.
Residents of the Salt Lake City 
suburb told Mayor Dan Snarr to either save it or shave it by giving a thumbs-up or thumbs-down sign during the annual parade Wednesday.The mayor’s wife, April, said 
she was tired of being poked by the facial hair and living with a “freak.” She campaigned to have it removed, even carrying a giant pair of wooden scissors during the parade to convince voters.
“A nice trim would make me 
happy,” April Snarr said. “I try to kiss him but can’t ﬁ  nd a way in. And he pokes me in the eye. I think he loses his credibility.”Snarr, who dressed as Uncle 
Sam and carried a giant poster in the parade that read, “I Want You to Save My ‘Stache,” wants to keep his stiff upper lip.
“My plan is to keep the 
‘stache,” said the 62-year-old. “People have said, ‘That’s your whole identity.’ I can’t take away my identity.”
Snarr has been growing the 
mustache for the past 31 months.

After two years of growing pains, 
repairs and making accommodations, 
the locally owned restaurant The Jones Eastside is expanding with a new location in the downtown area.
A bit south and slightly west of the 
original, the new restaurant will call 203 SW Second Ave. home, where the building’s past two tenants Fyre Grill and Agave Blue only remained a short time. It is slated to open in mid-August.
Maya Garner, co-owner and gen-
eral manager, said the main reason for the expansion is lack of space and proper infrastructure at the Northeast 23rd Avenue location, which seats about 30 to 34 people. 
Co-owner and husband Tree Gar-
ner said the new location will seat four to ﬁ  ve times more than that, and although the hours may slightly change, the original location will re-main open.
The idea of expanding has been 
in their minds for a couple of years — ever since they were forced to rent extra space on Main Street in order to handle the volume of food going through the kitchen.
In addition to more space and 
shorter waits, patrons can expect more live music, a full bar and an emphasis on early weekend brunches. 
“It will become more of a multi-
purpose place where you can bring your computer to do work and get coffee, eat lunch or dinner, and then come back later for drinks,” Maya Garner said.
The Eastside story is simple. Six 
years ago, the Garners set out to build a place that reﬂ  ected their philosophy on life and food — somewhere they would want their new daughter to  eat. What resulted was a restaurant with the goal of providing affordable, local, organic food rather than meet-ing proﬁ  t margins and increasing rev-enue.
“I’m not sure we even know how 
restaurants are supposed to be done,” Tree Garner said of he and Maya Gar-ner. “There is no one formula ﬁ  ts all, but what we are doing seems to be working.”
Tree Garner said many of their 
clients are shared with other locally owned businesses and restaurants, none of which he has ever seen as competition. In fact, he wouldn’t mind if there was one giant place all Gainesville’s local businesses could share.
Despite the addition, Maya Gar-
ner said this expansion is not about change. “People love The Jones for what it is, and we’re not trying to re-invent ourselves.”

� THE GROUP MEETS THE SECOND SUNDAY 
OF EVERY MONTH.
SAMANTHA SOLUM

Hula Hooping has become much more than spinning 
a toy around, especially in the Gainesville community.
The Gainesville Flow Arts Spin Jam meets the second 
Sunday of every month at Albert “Ray” Massey West-side Park from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m.
New and experienced ﬂ  ow artists listen to music, 
meet friends and share moves Sunday in the park, locat-ed at 1001 NW 34th St., on a ﬁ  eld near the tennis courts.
Although the majority of the group members are 
hoopers, some practice poi, a performance art that in-volves swinging tethered weights through a variety of rhythmical and geometric patterns, as well as other ﬂ  ow arts.
Beth Hudson, 32, took over as an administrator for 
the group when the founder, Michala Jones, moved to Orlando with her hoop-making business last month.
Hudson says the term “ﬂ  ow artist” refers to any com-
bination of dance and prop manipulation, and ﬂ  ow is a mental state in which the difﬁ  culty of the action and the skill level of the practitioner are perfectly balanced.
“When you experience ﬂ  ow you become totally ab-
sorbed in the activity to the point where you lose your sense of self and time, and experience happiness and fulﬁ  llment.”
Asaf Mor, a 19-year-old sophomore engineering ma-
jor and vice president of UF’s juggling club, Objects in Motion, showed his skills at the jam on Sunday.
Although he enjoys ﬂ  ow arts as a hobby and is in-
creasing in skill level, Mor said he mainly uses ﬂ  ow arts as a way to meet people.
“I’ve deﬁ  nitely met more like-minded people and 
made more friends from ﬂ  ow than I ever did from class, bars or parties,” Mor said.
Hudson said the jams are casual meetups and not a 
class, but all skill levels are welcome and there are usu-ally extra hoops and help offered to new hoopers.
Hudson said today’s Hula Hoops are made of dif-
ferent kinds of plastics than in the past. They are a bet-ter size and weight for adults, which allows for a much broader range of motion that works the whole body and allows for the performing of tricks.
The next jam is scheduled for July 22, 
and Hudson said they plan to continue to meet regularly.
“The combination of play, exer-
cise, practicing a skill and socializing are always an automatic mood-lift-er.” Hudson said.

Inside Earth Origins Mar-
ket, it’s anything but quiet.
Customers stride through 
the door, cars ﬁ  ght for limited parking spots and employees scurry about.
Salyne Pryor, ofﬁ  ce man-
ager, has almost 10 years un-der her belt, the days are wea-rying.
For a tiny organic store 
located on Northwest 13th Street, business is booming.
Gainesville has a plethora 
of organic stores and  markets that provide chemical-free products for students and residents.
Most are locally owned and 
keep to their original roots.However, companies like 
PepsiCo Inc., Kellogg, Coca-Cola and General Mills are now getting in on the action.  For example, PepsiCo Inc. produces Naked drink prod-ucts.                               
All over 
the country, small organ-ic companies worry about this. Their nightmare is coming true.
But Pryor thinks it’s a 
blessing.
“People that didn’t do or-
ganic before are looking more toward eating better for their family.”
However, nothing is truly Gainesville is involved 
in organic movementdining  

organic without government ap-
proval.
The process starts out with 
soil that is certified free of any pesticides and fertilizers. Or -
ganic meat and dairy products are also produced in the same way. Animals are raised natu-rally and never fed antibiotics or other quick-producing hor -
mones.
It is very expensive and takes 
years to aquire the USDA seal.
“I think it’s easier to deceive 
the customer,” said Kathy Mar -
key, the assistant manager at Sunflower Health Foods. “If you don’t have [the seal], then it’s questionable.”
On the other hand, Pryor said 
she believes name brands that promote organic food will ex-pand the whole movement.
“A lot of people like name 
recognition,” she said.If popularity can cause more 
organic farming to occur, then prices will be able to come down. Eating healthy can be quite pricey.
Big name companies could 
help cheapen and produce more organic products for Americans if done in the proper way.
However, most food prod-
ucts are made of genetically modified organisms. This could compromise the integrity of the organic product if name-brand companies introduce this into the organic world.
From organic restaurants, 
stores and even ice cream shops, the organic movement has made its mark in Gainesville.
“Gainesville does a nice job 
trying to keep it more plentiful for everybody,” Markey said. “I think that’s something all around the United States. People are try-ing to go back to the roots and get that good, organic food.”  10, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 12, 2012

Picture this, you start a fundraiser. In 
15 days you raise $4,500, but you set your 
goal at $9,600.  If you don’t raise the full $9,600, you get nothing, zero, goose egg.
This is how the website Kickstarter 
works. It refers to itself as a “crowd fund-ing website for creative projects.” The proj-ects must meet certain guidelines before launch. The creator chooses a deadline and sets a minimum goal for funds to raise, but the catch is that Kickstarter runs on an all-or-nothing basis.  
Backers can donate money at any time, 
free of charges until the end date, provided the goal is met. 
This has had R.H. “Chip” Norman on 
the edge of his seat for the past 17 days.
Norman, an UF alumnus, is writing, di-
recting and producing a short ﬁ  lm depict-ing a true story about his great grandfather — a miner in the U.S. phosphate industry during the 1940s who became upset when a young white man in his crew was re-placed by a black man.
“When your aunt tells you as a child 
that your great grandfather was an illiter-ate, third grade educated-racist and very mean spirited man who victimized some-one, that sticks with you,” Norman said.
The ﬁ  lm, “Mulberry,” is set to be about 
10 to 15 minutes long and is being ﬁ  lmed in Gainesville and various locations in Polk County. The actual events happened in Mulberry.
Norman is keeping the punchline a se-cret, but it will touch on racism in the south and show the point of view of a poor black miner who is taunted by his co-workers.  
Norman has hopes to turn this into a 
feature ﬁ  lm.  Once completed he is enter-ing it in festivals around the country.
The principal cast will have ﬁ  ve to six 
people, including local musician Wester Joseph, who will be making his on-screen debut in Billy Bob Thortons ﬁ  lm, “Jayne Mansﬁ  eld’s Car” this fall.  
Other actors involved are Ron Clinton 
Smith, Larry Weeks, Letecia Clark and Jason Hedges, lead singer of local band Heavy Petty, a Tom Petty cover group.
“We’re telling a deep south epic in 15 
minutes,” said Norman.
Joseph is passionate about this ﬁ  lm 
due to his rearing in the South.  He will be 
playing Clarence Barnes the protagonist in ‘Mul-berry.’
“People were worried 
that I would be offended that in this story the ‘n word’ might be used. I am not worried about that. 
That is life; life has taught me that can hap-pen at any moment.”
Following a successful Kickstarter cam-
paign, the crew hopes to start ﬁ  lming the ﬁ  rst week of August. Kickstarter can hold funds for 19 days, hence the short time frame for the ﬁ  lm’s fundraiser.
“$9,600 is our budget down to a dollar,” 
Norman said. “We need people to support us. Any amount of money will help, and if you don’t have money, simply help spread the word.”
Donations merit prizes from the ﬁ  lm’s 
crew. The pledges range from $1 to $4,000 and prizes include a copy of the ﬁ  lm, per-sonalized “thank you” video messages, a list of the best ﬁ  lms of all time, signed movie posters and scripts, a walk on role in the ﬁ  lm and fossils from the phosphate mine.
“Mulberry” was selected as a staff pick 
by Kickstarter and is on the front page of the website. The project ends Monday at 1:39 p.m.

All He Does Is Win, Apparently
Tim Tebow won the “Best Moment” ESPY last night 
for his game-winning touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas in the Broncos 29-23 playoff victory against the Steelers on Jan. 8.  ADAM PINCUS
 Alligator Writer
   
 Brett Goetz didn’t mean to cre-
ate a football juggernaut. He just 
wanted to help the kids in his com-munity.
  The creator of the elite 7-on-7 
team, the South Florida Express, started the squad in 2007 after bringing back a youth tackle foot-ball program in South Beach.
  Goetz never played football, 
but the UF graduate and ﬁ  nancial advisor volunteered with a Miami Beach organization. The opportu-nity to service the community was enough.
  “My wife and other people 
around me said, ‘Why are you do-ing this? It’s such a pain. You don’t have a kid involved.’ The truth is, it became more about helping these 
kids,” Go-etz said. “Keep-ing kids 
off the street, teaching them life skills and basic things from shak-ing hands the correct way to a lot of different things like communicat-ing with people whether it’s your coaches, your teachers, your par-ents.”
  Five years later, after starting 
with 40 players at its ﬁ  rst tryout attracted 200-plus players and 40 media members at the last audition Feb. 4.
  Goetz attributes the attention 
surrounding the team to the tackle football league where he built rela-tionships with local sports writers, which culminated in Scout.com asking him to start the Express.
  “I didn’t realize it, but I did 
know I had the media contacts to reach out. Year by year it has grown on its own.”
  Even former NFL stars like Sam 
Madison, Samari Rolle and Patrick Surtain help coach the players in tournaments and practices.  “We actually have guys now 
that can bring stuff to the table in so many ways,” Goetz said. “Even [the current players’] parents tell me that the stuff they have picked up are so absolutely invaluable to their football careers.”
  Express defensive back and 
Florida offer Jamal Carter added, “It feels great to have them, because they’ve been where I want to go to,” Carter said. “That helps me out a lot. Anything they tell me I listen to them.”
  Football is only one aspect for 
the Express. The team travels to-gether and builds lasting relation-ships on the road — sometimes at each other’s expense. Carter and his teammates tweet pictures of sleep-ing teammates during bus rides up the state.
  These players are going through 
the same recruiting process, which Goetz sees as a bonding tool.
  “What makes it unique is it’s not 
just the tournaments and the play-ing,” he said. “It’s more about the camaraderie that we build with the program and our kids.”
  Express alumni like West Vir-
ginia quarterback Geno Smith, for-mer Ohio State running back Jaamal Berry and former USC linebacker Frankie Telfort continue their re-lationships ﬁ  ve years after playing with the team.
  Other teams have sprouted up 
in recent years to compete with the Express. Team Tampa with Florida targets Vernon Hargreaves III and Leon McQuay III defeated the Ex-press Elite team 24-18 at the IMG Madden Football 7-on-7 National Championship earlier this month.
  Goetz brought two teams to the 
IMG national championship, which featured wide receiver Jordan Cun-ningham who holds a Florida offer.
  Current Gators wide receiver 
Quinton Dunbar and defensive back Jabari Gorman suited up for the Express in years past.
  It’s been ﬁ  ve years since Goetz 
created the South Florida Express. His daughter is now 6-years-old.
  Although he has one child of his 
own, Goetz has impacted the lives of South Florida kids for years.

THE RALLY
  Corey: With opening night of the 
Olympics 15 days away, baseball has begun its media dominance. 
Naturally, my time has been spent watch-ing countless hours of NCIS reruns. But we here at alligatorSports have a solution: football talk. Yes, it’s time to start dream-ing of the gridiron. So, to kick it off, we de-bate who will win the Southeastern Con-ference’s East Division this season. And despite kicking them to the curb on NCAA 13 the other day, I’m taking South Caro-lina — luckily ECU is a non-conference game. The Gamecocks are coming off of an 11-2 record, and with the Ol’ Ball Coach in charge, this is their year. Marcus Lattimore comes back healthy from an ACL tear, quarterback Connor Shaw will have only improved from last season and both starting safeties return to a secondary that was second in passing defense in the nation last year. Let the Cock growl.
  Joe: In the words of sportscaster Dan 
Patrick, “Don’t play with ﬁ  re, scarecrow.” Baseball is a national treasure! Now, I’ll move on to our college football debate. Georgia won the SEC East last year, and guess what. The Bulldogs will be in the Georgia Dome for a second straight year come Dec. 1. Granted, UGA coach Mark Richt kicked ris-ing sophomore running back Isa-iah Crowell off the team after he was arrested for scratching the se-rial number off a gun. That’s a clown felony, 
Cro. However, the Bulldogs return start-ing quarterback Aaron Murray — the best quarterback in the SEC — and lost only two starters on defense. When the 2012 SEC Championship Game pops up on the schedule, Georgia will be saying, “Ock, ohem, oktei, weis, Atlanta.” Yes, that was another John Carter reference.  Corey: Any true movie fan would know 
that, Joe, just like every football fan can admit that the competition in the East this year will ﬁ  nally live up to the hype, un-like the aforementioned movie. Come Oc-tober, both teams will be 3-0 in SEC play and looking to take control of the division. Playing at home, those pesky ‘Cocks will prevail. Shaw will follow up his breakout season, where he put up a passer rating of 148.31, threw 14 touchdowns and rushed for eight in 10 games, with yet another strong year. And now that the offense has their cornerstone in Lattimore back, it will be that much easier for the junior quarter-back. The defense returns six players re-sponsible for giving up only 267.7 yards a 
 Clowns, guns and ‘John Carter’: Who will win the SEC East?

Wednesday and another one was put on hold on the first day contracts could be signed in the NBA.
Ray Allen and Rashard Lewis 
inked their deals with the NBA champions, who will rely on their perimeter accuracy to create more space on the floor for LeBron James and Dwyane Wade.
The Knicks completed a sign-and-
trade to bring Marcus Camby to New York. But there’s no deal for the best big man of them all in the NBA.
The Magic can’t find an agreement 
they like for All-Star center Dwight Howard, who has asked for a trade to Brooklyn. The Magic have tried to accommodate, only to find nothing from the Nets that fit their desires.
“We’ve had discussions with 
Brooklyn, we’ve had discussions with a host of different teams about a host of different issues. And the answer is, yes we’re still talking to them,” Magic general manager Rob Hennigan said. “We’re still looking to do whatever it is that puts us in the best position from a sustainabil-ity standpoint, (and) from a strategic standpoint.
“...Currently as they stand I think 
the parameters that we’ve talked about are a little bit in a stationary position. And currently as it’s con-structed I’m not sure there’s really anything to discuss.”
Free agency opened July 1 and teams were able to begin signing players at 12:01 a.m. EDT Wednes-day. Deron Williams got a quick start, signing his five-year, $98 mil-lion extension with the Nets while in Las Vegas for the U.S. Olympic team’s training camp right after the window opened.
Even though he hasn’t been able 
to get Howard, Nets general man-ager Billy King kept Williams, traded for All-Star guard Joe Johnson, kept starting forward Gerald Wallace and will likely do the same with center Brook Lopez.
“Billy’s done a good job of mak-
ing some big moves and it makes us relevant again,” Williams said. “Just the move to Brooklyn itself, being in New York, makes things better.”
Things are looking up for another 
longtime lowly team, the Los Ange-les Clippers. Blake Griffin wanted to be a part of it, signing a five-year extension that could play him about $95 million.
“It’s exciting and that was the goal 
from day one, to start building some-thing and not just fall into the history of the program,” Griffin said, “and I think we’ve done a good job of turn-ing the ship in the right direction.”
Allen decided to leave one good situation for another, taking less money from the Heat. With he and Lewis, Miami will have options all over the floor.
“You’ve got to double-team LeB-
ron. You have to double-team Dw-yane Wade. You’ve got to double-team Chris Bosh. And then you think they’re going to leave Ray Allen open?” Lewis said. “They’ve got to leave somebody open. So I have to go shoot a million jumpers tonight and be ready to knock them down.”
Another good 3-point shooter, 
Ryan Anderson, has a new home. After leading the league in 3-point-ers made last season and winning the NBA’s Most Improved Player award, he was dealt by the Magic to New Orleans for Mexican Gustavo Ayon.
The Hornets have three days to 
decide if they want Eric Gordon to play with Anderson. He signed an offer sheet in Phoenix for four years and $58 million, but New Orleans has three days to match the deal for the restricted free agent.
Amid all the dealing, there was 
no chance Tim Duncan was go-ing anywhere. Terms were not dis-closed, though Yahoo Sports cited anonymous sources in reporting the 36-year-old forward got a three-year, $36 million deal from the Spurs.
“Duncan has established himself 
as one of the best players in NBA his-tory,” coach Gregg Popovich said. “He is an unselfish superstar who loves to compete and has only one goal when he steps on the court — to do whatever it takes to help his team win. We are all thrilled that he’ll spend his entire career as a San An-tonio Spur.”

game, good enough for third in the country. 
Defensive end Jadeveon Clowney will make his way into a starting role and prove why he was the No. 1 overall recruit two years ago. Off the bench last season, he was responsible for 12 tackles behind the line, including eight sacks, including one against Georgia that forced a fumble returned for a touchdown, which ul-timately was the winning touchdown. I hear Murray has been afraid of clowns ever since.
Joe: Everybody is afraid of clowns, but 
Clowney won’t scare Murray. The Bulldogs signal-caller is a bona fide Heisman Trophy candidate this season, and that is the truth. During his sophomore season, Murray led the SEC with 35 touchdown passes and ranked second with 3,149 yards through the air. With another year of experience under his belt, Georgia will be just fine offensively. Granted, UGA lost three of its five starting offensive linemen from 2011, but with a calm, collected Murray at the helm, they should be fine. How-ever, as much talent as Murray boasts in the Bulldogs backfield, Georgia’s defense will be the reason for its second straight trip to the SEC Championship Game. As I said before, the unit that ranked fifth in the nation — not too far behind third-place South Carolina — in to-tal defense (277.2 yards per game) last season only loses two starters compared to the Game-cocks’ five. Defensive end DeAngelo Tyson is the only Bulldog not returning from Georgia’s starting front seven, which ranked third in the SEC behind Alabama and LSU with just 101.2 yards allowed on the ground per game last season. Linebacker Jarvis Jones, the SEC’s reigning sack leader (13.5), anchors the group. As far as the secondary is concerned, look no further than free safety Bacarri Rambo. The senior, who led the SEC with eight intercep-tions and ranked second with 16 passes de-fended, dominated opposing wide receivers in 2011 and looks to do so again in 2012. With a talented, experienced defense and a polished quarterback, UGA is primed for another trip to Atlanta in December. And don’t even get me started on the schedule. Georgia’s SEC West foes this season are Ole Miss (yawn) and Au-burn (tradition) — both very winnable games. The true tests will be road games against Mis-souri and South Carolina. As far as Columbia, S.C., the Bulldogs have won four out of the last five games they have played against the Gamecocks at Williams-Brice Stadium. If UGA wants a true road test, they should travel to Barsoom and face off against the Tharks and Dotar Sojat John Carter. Georgia has the easi-est path to the Georgia Dome this season, and they are the best-equipped team to get there.

Jonathon Crawford, Baseball 
In his postseason debut, Crawford threw the Gators’ 
first no-hitter in the NCAA Tournament since John Burke in 1991 against Furman. The sophomore had five strikeouts in the 4-0 win over Bethune-Cookman. The only thing that stopped Crawford from recording a perfect game was a walk in the third inning against designated hitter Jake Welch. During the next at bat, Welch was thrown out by Gators catcher Mike Zunino. Crawford was the seventh pitcher in NCAA Tourna-ment history to throw a no-no.
Kytra Hunter, Gymnastics 
In the NCAA Tournament, the freshman became the first Gator to win the NCAA All-Around title. She used a score of 39.725 to edge out Georgia’s Kat Ding by .075. In addition to grabbing the first NCAA All-Around title for Florida, Hunter also became the first Gator to win multiple NCAA titles in a single year by winning the vault title with a score of 9.8750. Hunter is the fifth gymnast to win multiple NCAA events as a freshman.
