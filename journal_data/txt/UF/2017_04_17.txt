William Walker said he feels understood in 
the classes designated for his major. 
Before pursuing her minor, Jessie Wang 
said she didn’t fully understand the history in-grained in Chinese culture. 
Both UF seniors are among a group of stu-
dents ﬁ  ghting for their respective studies — the 
African-American studies major and the Asian American studies minor — to ensure the re-sources are still available for their programs to continue to grow.The ﬁ  ght for both programs’ growth is be-
ing led in part by Sharon Austin, the director of 
the African American studies program. Austin, 
who has been at UF for 16 years, said the goal is to expand the African American studies pro-gram into a center and increase the amount of faculty available for the Asian American stud-ies minor.
“A lot of people don’t like to talk about 
issues with race and ethnicity, but those are issues in our society that aren’t going away,” Austin said.

HE WAS HOSPITALIZED FRIDAY.

UF offensive lineman T.J. McCoy was 
hospitalized early Friday after his scooter 
was reportedly struck by a drunk driver in a hit-and-run accident, family conﬁ  rmed.
Just before 2 a.m. Friday, McCoy and his 
girlfriend were stopped for trafﬁ  c on Mc-Coy’s scooter near 2000 W. University Ave. after leaving a UF library when the pair was struck by a blue 2011 Honda Civic driving west. Samantha Meldrem, 22, the driver of the car, was headed westbound and drove away after the accident, according to an ar-rest report. 
Gainesville Police found Meldrem in the 
100 block of Northwest 20th Drive, where she had stopped the car. The car’s wind-shield was broken from the outside, and there was damage to the car’s hood and front bumper, according to the report. 
When ofﬁ  cers spoke with Meldrem, she 
stumbled before leaning against an ofﬁ  cer’s patrol car, her speech was slurred and her eyes bloodshot and watery. When asked, Meldrem told ofﬁ  cers she had a double-shot mixed drink at Salty Dog Saloon roughly two hours before the accident, according to the report. 
She later told ofﬁ  cers she had been un-able to brake when the accident happened, according to the report. Ofﬁ  cials took McCoy and his girlfriend to the trauma unit at UF Health Shands Hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening.
Police arrested Meldrem on a DUI charge 
after she blew two consecutive .190 breath samples, more than twice the legal limit. She was released from the Alachua County Jail at about 1:45 p.m. Friday on a $10,000 bond. 
 GPD: UF oﬀ  ensive lineman injured after hit-and-run accidentBy Romy Ellenbogen 
Alligator Staff Writer  
A man was removed from UF’s 
campus Thursday after he con-
fronted two members of the univer-sity’s African American studies pro-gram in their ofﬁ  ce and expressed support for a racist ideology.
Thomas John Kelly, the founder 
of the British Reformed Sectarian 
Party of Florida — which in the 
past has reportedly barred African-Americans from joining — block-aded the ofﬁ  ce’s doorway as he ranted about reverse racism, said Sharon Burney, a program assis-tant in the African American stud-ies program.
University Police removed Kelly, 
54, for criminal trespassing about 40 minutes after he entered the of-ﬁ  ce space and “espoused a racist ideology,” UF spokesperson Janine Sikes wrote in an email Friday.
Kelly has been banned from the 
campus and all of UF property, in-cluding UF Health Shands Hospital, according to UPD’s active trespass list.
The ban did little to return Bur-
ney her peace of mind. She decided to stay home Friday, and going for-
ward, the front door to Walker 
Hall, which 
houses the Af-rican Ameri-
can studies program, will remain locked during the day.
During the 
incident, she later said, Burney 
feared for her life and did not know 
if Kelly intended to harm anyone or if he was armed.
“I’m just trying to do my job — 
do I have to die in the process?” Burney said.
Two days earlier, Kelly sent 
Burney and a professor in the de-partment, Sharon Austin, an email 
asking to debate members of the 
program, Burney said. She said he  Man trespassed after 
confronting UF faculty

Turkey votes to expand presi-
dent’s powers; critics cry fraud
ISTANBUL (AP) — Turkish 
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan won a historic referendum Sunday that will greatly ex-pand the powers of his office, 
although opposition parties 
questioned the outcome and said they would challenge the results.With 99 percent of the ballots counted, the “yes” vote stood at 51.37 percent, while the “no” vote was 48.63 percent, accord-ing to the state-run Anadolu 
Agency. The head of Turkey’s 
electoral board confirmed the “yes” victory and said final re-sults will be declared in 11 to 12 days.
Fugitive Mexican ex-governor 
moved to Guatemalan prison
GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — A 
former governor who had be-come a symbol of government corruption in Mexico was trans-ferred to a Guatemalan military 
prison on Sunday hours after 
being captured in a hotel follow-ing six months on the lam.Ex-Veracruz state Gov. Javier Duarte looked pale and visibly tired as he was brought to the military base in Guatemala’s capital guarded by two dozen police officers. Prosecutors in 
Mexico directed the Foreign 
Relations Department to request his extradition to his homeland, where he is wanted on suspi-cion of money laundering and organized crime.Duarte, 43, was captured Saturday in Panajachel, a pic-turesque tourist town on Lake 
Atitlan in Guatemala’s high-
lands, with the cooperation of that country’s police and Interpol office, a statement from Mexico’s federal Attorney 
General’s Office said.
Mass evacuation in Syria post-poned after blast kills 80 kids 
BEIRUT (AP) — The evacua-
tion of more than 3,000 Syrians that was scheduled to take place Sunday from four areas as part of a population transfer has 
been postponed, opposition ac-
tivists said, a day after a deadly blast that killed more than 120 people, many of them govern-ment supporters.The reasons for the delay were not immediately clear. It came as shells fired by the Islamic State group on government-held 
parts of the eastern city of Deir el-Zour wounded two members 
of a Russian media delegation visiting the area, according to state-run Syrian news agency SANA.Russia is a main backer of Syrian President Bashar Assad and Russian journalists enjoy wide access in government-held 
parts of the country.
Russia’s Anna-News military news service, which employs the journalists, said one was wounded in the arm while the other suffered leg and stomach wounds. The news service said the two were evacuated adding that their condition was “satis-
factory.”
The United Nations is not over-seeing the transfer deal, which involves residents of the pro-government villages of Foua and Kfarya and the opposition-held towns of Madaya and Zabadani. All four have been under siege for years, their fate 
linked through a series of recip-
rocal agreements that the U.N. says have hindered aid deliver-
ies.
Hundreds march against far-right French presidential hopeful 
PARIS (AP) — Hundreds 
of demonstrators in France marched on Sunday to protest far-right National Front lead-er and presidential candidate 
Marine Le Pen, saying that basic 
freedoms would disappear if she were elected.Some protesters threw firebombs at police during the march from suburban Aubervilliers to a Paris neighborhood where Le Pen is scheduled to hold a rally Monday. Officers responded 
with tear gas during the small 
skirmishes.Fernanda Marrucchelli said Le Pen’s anti-immigration party “is fighting our essential freedoms, our rights, no matter if we are French or immigrant.”A banner at the front of the march read “Paris-Suburbs 
Against the National Front.” 
Marchers handed out tracts denouncing xenophobia and racism that they allege Le Pen and her anti-immigration party represent.HIGH  88° LOW  58°VOLUME 111 ISSUE 141MONDAY, APRIL 17, 2017   ALLIGATOR   3

Dressed in nothing but neon-pink 
lingerie and sneakers, UF student 
Mackenzie Conol spent her Friday 
night running across campus, draw-ing stares and honks.
She was joined on her jog by 
about 35 other near-naked students, 
some in boxers, briefs and spandex. 
Their goal, participants said, was to donate clothing to a local homeless shelter and embrace insecurities.
Before stripping down and taking 
off on The Great Underwear Dash, which lasted about ﬁ  ve minutes, a tradition at UF since at least Spring 2005, they gathered six bags of 
clothing to donate to the St. Francis 
House. 
For Conol, a UF industrial and 
systems engineering junior, each stride reminded her of high school, a 
span of two years in which she was 
homeless. The event allows her to 
address an issue close to her heart.
“It’s my favorite day of the se-
mester,” the 21-year-old said.
Conol and Dakotah Diaz, 21, 
organized this semester’s race after participating in the race two years 
ago. 
Participants met on Turlington 
Plaza, where they stripped down and then took off, running a lap 
through Turlington toward Univer-sity Avenue, turning around the new chemistry building and back to the plaza. Cars honked as participants ran down University, and students walking through campus gave the group curious stares. 
Diaz, who wore black briefs and 
neon-green running shoes, said while he uses the run to donate to charity, he has also made some close 
friends during past dashes in the past 
two years that he has participated. 
“It brings people together,” the 
UF business administration junior 
said. 
Removing clothing breaks down 
people’s barriers, and runners bond through their shared vulnerability, he said. 
“It’s a really big self-esteem 
booster,” Diaz said. 
Jack Rasmussen, a 19-year-old UF 
computer science freshman, came 
prepared with his Marine Corp. ﬂ  ag 
tied around his neck as a cape.
Rasmussen said he was at the 
front of the pack as he ran down Uni-versity Avenue with his hands up in 
the air, collecting a single honk. 
“I didn’t get (physical training) 
today, so I felt like I needed to get a 
workout in,” he said. “What a better way than running down University 
in your underwear?”
A group of four graduating se-
niors wore ﬂ  uffy panda hats to ac-
company their black and pink bras and underwear. 
Carolina Cardona, a 24-year-old 
UF industrial and systems engineer-
ing senior, said Friday was her ﬁ  rst 
time on campus in just her under-wear. 
She said the group of friends de-
cided to add the panda accessory 
as “an extra touch” to their senior 
bucket-list run. 
“I can’t believe we did that,” she 
said.

McCoy’s father, Tony McCoy,

“We have been overshadowed

McCoy later posted a note on

“I’m resting and getting stron-

Burney said Kelly apparently 
came by the building Wednesday night, according to a janitor, but nei-ther of them were in the office at the time.
Because of the layout of the office 
and Kelly’s height — he stood more than 6 feet tall by the professors’ es-timate — neither of the women were able to leave the office when he con-
fronted them.
“He seemed to be getting agitat-
ed, and with the office being such a 
closed-in space, we couldn’t really leave,” Austin said. “We were very fearful, and it made both of us un-comfortable.”
When Kelly took a step forward, 
Burney used the opportunity to slip 
out and run down the hall to tell 
a colleague to call the police. She then ran back, afraid to leave Austin alone.
The colleague she asked to call 
the police texted Burney, saying the police wanted Burney to call them herself and provide more details.
Burney said she couldn’t because 
the man was right in front of her. Burney and Austin said they were frustrated the police didn’t immedi-ately come, considering the rash of hateful incidents that have occurred on campus since January.
“In a situation like this, I think 
all calls should be taken seriously,” Austin said. “Especially in African-American studies, because the other incidents in just the last month.”
Burney said she felt like the re-
sponse should have been immediate. She said if the two of them had been shot, nobody would have found out 
for hours.
“Soon as you heard Walker Hall 
they should have been on their way,” 
Burney said. “Call it a hate crime, be-cause that’s what it was.”
Last month, the sign outside 
Walker Hall, which also houses the Center for Jewish Studies, was found pushed over, prompting increased 
police patrols.
Sikes said anyone who feels 
afraid or threatened should call the 
police immediately.
“Since an incident earlier this 
year when the department’s sign was pushed over, the University of Flori-da Police Department has increased patrols and will continue to work 
with faculty and staff to help ensure 
a safe work environment,” Sikes said Friday.
Burney said she was upset to find 
out Kelly had apparently harassed other African-American professors at the Levin College of Law last year. She said Kelly had waited around for the professors and printed poster-
sized images of their faces.
The professors should have been 
made aware of him, Burney argued, 
because their lack of knowledge pre-vented them from taking his initial email seriously.
“He should have been handled 
when it happened at the law school,” Burney said.
To help other students — some 
of whom Kelly described to Burney and Austin with physical characteris-tics — the professors will put up an image of him.
“I don’t want to be a sitting 
duck,” Burney said. “I feel like a sit-ting duck. I feel very unsafe.”

she watched other directors before her try and abandon the process, leaving successors to start from scratch.
Her first attempt to push the program into a 
center was in 2015. But it failed, so she wanted to try again this year.
She said turning the program into a center 
will help them add a master’s program and re-cruit faculty.
Programs cannot offer tenure, so professors 
in African-American studies must also work in other departments, dividing their time.
“It’s almost like having two jobs, but you 
have a lot more work than the average faculty member,” Austin said. “It puts professors at a disadvantage, especially professors of color, because they tend to be the people hired in these joint-appointed positions.”
The number of students with an African-
American studies major has continued to grow. Austin said their program has more stu-
dents in the major than any other university in 
the nation. The major was first offered in 2013, and there are currently about 100 students in the program.
Walker said he thinks making changes to 
the African American studies program would help with retention and improve understand-ing of the black community on campus. “We want something loud and proud on 
the University of Florida’s campus saying that 
the University of Florida accepts the culture 
that has helped the University of Florida prog-ress throughout the years,” he said.
Initially Walker was frustrated by the delay 
in the program’s transition to becoming a full-fledged department, but said he now recogniz-es the importance of having a stepping stone.
“We understand, especially in a conser-
vative space such as Florida, we understand 
that sometimes you can’t get the whole pie,” 
Walker said. “You have to take what you can get — take a slice — and then come back later and get a little bit more.”
Once Austin drafts the formal proposal, it 
will be reviewed by layers of administration, starting with administration in the College of Liberal Arts and Science. Costs, space and oth-er details will be worked out as the paperwork 
moves forward, eventually up to being signed 
off on by President Kent Fuchs and Provost Joe Glover and approved by the Board of Trustees. 
Mary Watt, the associate dean for UF’s Col-
lege of Liberal Arts and Sciences, said they support the center, but it’s a long process to develop it. She said right now they’re tweaking the proposal with Austin. 
“It’s really embryonic right now,” Watt 
said. “There is a lot of work still to be done.” 
Austin said that while on the long path to 
becoming a center, the program will continue to grow. 
“We have few resources and we have few 
faculty, but we have a very committed Student Body,” she said.

Wang has seen Asian American studies go 
from a certificate to a minor, but she still fears its progress will be erased. In less than two weeks, she’ll be the ninth student to graduate with the minor.
“As a person of color, you always have to 
fight for your resources,” the 21-year-old UF psychology senior said.
Wang has helped push for letters of support 
on behalf of the minor. She said though the minor is new, it doesn’t have many classes or faculty to sustain it.
Wang wants to see the Asian American 
studies minor grow even more — but realis-
tically, she just hopes it continues. The class-
es she took for the minor, particularly Asian American politics, gave her a sense of empow-erment and direction.
“It’s important to bring awareness to com-
munities of color, and we do that through eth-nic studies,” she said. “Because as displaced people, as immigrants, as minorities, in a country, it’s super important to know your 
own history so you know about these systemic 
issues that are impacting you whether or not you like it.”Tara Chang, the 10th student to declare the 
minor, has also worked to gather letters of sup-port. Chang said she got the idea from Austin, who thought letters might be beneficial.
The business administration senior was 
worried when one of the professors who taught a course moved away, leaving the class without a teacher. 
“It’s not that they’re going to cut (the mi-
nor),” the 21-year-old said. “It’s just, how are 
you going to continue to grow the minor and 
allow people to continue learning if you’re not even able to offer courses for that?”
Austin said the small number of people in 
the minor doesn’t show a lack of interest, but a lack of publicity. 
“The minor is really relatively new,” she 
said. “A lot of people don’t know about it.”
Austin said the lack of faculty also hurts the 
minor. Getting more faculty is one of the things Chang and Wang hope to see. 
Wang feels that the value of ethnic studies 
goes beyond the pages of a textbook and the walls of a classroom. 
“The difference between ethnic studies and 
chemistry, per se, is that it’s not academia that’s isolated,” she said. “It’s something that’s living and breathing, and it affects the lives of 
people today.”

A UF professor and a local brew-
ing company are working to bring 
a new type of beer to Gainesville.
Brian Pearson, a UF Institute of 
Food and Agricultural Sciences as-
sistant professor of environmental 
horticulture, ﬁ  rst teamed up with First Magnitude Brewing Compa-ny earlier this month to produce the ﬁ  rst beer under the new label “Fresh from Florida: Made with Florida Hops.” The beer is made with hops, seed cones of the hops plant, that provide ﬂ  avoring. Be-
cause the hops are being grown in 
Florida, the beer will taste unique compared to beers in other parts of the world, Pearson said.
Pearson, who ﬁ  rst started ex-
perimenting with hops growth ﬁ  ve years ago, said the idea came after 
tasting a beer with hops in England 
and realizing that he couldn’t buy that same beer back home in the U.S.
After his ﬁ  rst successful trial in 
2012, he reached out to First Mag-nitude Brewing Company in Janu-ary to discuss making the beer.
“By the end of the conversation 
we were already talking about the potential labels for the beer bot-tle,” he said.
First Magnitude Brewing Com-
pany produced about 120 bottles of the beer for $7 a bottle. On its release date, April 6, the beer was sold out within the ﬁ  rst hour, Pear-son said. Now he’s looking to cre-ate a second beer.
“I used to dream about what 
it would be like to drink my own 
beer at a bar in the future,” he said. 
Richard Smith, a biological sci-
entist at the UF Institute of Food 
and Agricultural Sciences in Apop-ka, said he enjoyed the taste of the beer.
“Hops is an interesting ingredi-
ent because it can taste so different every time,” Smith said. “This beer 
had an earthiness to it that made it 
distinct.” 
He said that he is not surprised 
that yet another successful re-search-based experiment came out of Gainesville.
“The release of this beer is just 
another thing that contributes to the talent in Gainesville,” he said.  UF professor, brewery team up By Jimena T avel

Taking an opportunity that comes once every 20 
years, a group of Florida college students are trying to propose changes to the state’s constitution.
Students chosen at the Future of Florida Sum-
mit, held in February at UF, will submit three pos-
sible amendments to the state’s constitution revision 
commission this year, said TJ Pyche, the chair of the summit’s student organizing committee. Some of the  37-member constitution revision commission will meet 
April 26 at UF’s Phillips Center for the Performing Arts 
for a public hearing, part of the year they are given to 
gather ideas.
The commission will review amendments proposed 
by the public and choose some for voter consideration 
for the 2018 general election ballot. This is one of ﬁ  ve ways the Florida constitution can be amended, said Pyche, a 22-year-old UF journalism senior.
The February summit was hosted by the Bob Gra-
ham Center for Public Service and about 130 students attended — with about 70 from UF and the rest from 
about 25 other Florida colleges and universities. The 
students were divided into groups and encouraged to brainstorm ideas, with each group presenting to a panel of six judges, who chose the best three.“I think it exposed a lot of students to a process that 
a lot of folks don’t know about and that the state of Florida faces,” Pyche said.
The summit’s three proposed amendments are rais-
ing judges’ obligatory retirement age from 70 to 75 years, requiring school superintendents, county com-missioners and other elected constitutional ofﬁ  cer posi-
tions to be non-partisan in non-charter counties, and 
getting rid of a write-in loophole for elections, said Trevor Tezel, a second-year UF law student who at-tended the summit.
The winning groups, with the help of Tezel and oth-
er UF law students, are drafting papers to further ex-plain the amendments. Tezel said he became involved with the project because he thinks students’ ideas are often overlooked.
“I see this as an opportunity to elevate the students’ 
place in the conversation on Florida’s constitution,” the 24-year-old said.
Jon Mills, UF’s Levin College of Law dean emeritus, 
said he was one of the judges at the summit. Mills, who was on the 1997-1998 constitution revision commis-sion, said he was impressed with the students’ ideas.
“I was very impressed by their dedication and 
thoughts,” Mills said. “I think these students are part 
of the generation that’s going to be living with this con-
stitution.”  Students propose amendmentsSTATE

Four passengers of a small 
plane died in a crash at Williston 
Municipal Airport on Sunday, of-ﬁ  cials said.
The crash was reported to Wil-
liston Police Department at about 1:12 p.m. Sunday, Chief Dennis Strow wrote in a press release. 
Williston Fire Rescue and para-
medics from Levy County checked the wreckage of the silver and red 1948 Cessna 170 “taildragger” at the treeline of the north side of the 
runway and found the bodies of 
all four passengers. The plane was registered in Texas.
As of press time, the identities 
of the passengers have not been determined, Strow said.
Representatives from the Feder-
al Aviation Administration and Na-tional Transportation Safety Board 
are investigating the crash, accord-
ing to the release.
Strow said the airport remained 
open after the crash because the accident happened far enough from 
the runway. The airport declined to 
comment.
A 6-year-old boy and 4-month-
old girl died following a car wreck 
last Easter Sunday near Gainesville, 
according to Alligator archives. The girl’s father, who caused the crash, was arrested after police concluded he was under methamphetamine 
during the crash.

Here are ways to actually help Syrian refugees
I have seen many of the photographs. I 
have read the news. I have cringed as I read through tweets about the crisis in 
Syria, where more than 80 people, includ-
ing children, died in a chemical gas attack 
on April 4, and then hated myself for cringing when I should be translating that sorrow and 
disgust into action. So today, I provide you — 
by way of researching this myself — ways we can support Syrian refugees.
Donate to groups like Islamic Relief USA. According 
to its website, Islamic Relief USA provides items such 
as mattresses, shoes, food and medical help to Syrian 
refugees in the country and surrounding areas. With the help of monetary donations, Islamic Relief USA not only supports these refugees abroad but also within the U.S., 
helping them access job training and shelter in a new 
country.
Read and share stories about refugees and their expe-
riences. If you’re active on social media, share respon-sible, charitable websites that allow others to donate to 
people and areas affected by the Syrian crisis. Stay up-
to-date on current events with real news sources — try Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, NPR or The Associated Press if you’re in doubt — and 
encourage your friends and family to do the same. Set 
your standard for truth at a high bar by conﬁ  rming your facts with multiple reputable sources before clicking the “share” button (i.e., don’t accept the words coming straight from our press secretary’s mouth).
Sign petitions supporting refugee resettlement in the 
U.S. and contact your representatives about anti-Muslim and anti-refugee legislation. Make sure your voice is heard among the ofﬁ  cials we have collectively elected to 
public ofﬁ  ce; tell them to ﬁ  ght against prejudiced execu-
tive policy and discrimination. Refuse to vote for them in the upcoming midterm and general elections if they don’t.
If you’re wondering why you should per-
form any one or more of these actions, I could 
give you a list of reasons. Syrian refugees are 
innocent victims, and we ought to assist those who haven’t provoked attack themselves. The gases used in the attacks were banned by 
the Chemical Weapons Convention, and thus 
we should help those affected by this illegal and devastating weaponry.
These refugees, stateless as a result of years of civil 
war, are particularly vulnerable in ways similar to the 
Jewish people in the years leading to and during the 
Holocaust: Stripped of their identities, their nationali-ties and their homes, Syrian refugees are shunned and turned away at the doors of countries who label them 
as problematic, criminal or dangerous. Perhaps the ul-
timate causes and consequences of this comparison is the subject of another column. The underlying message, however, holds true: We should not stand idly by and al-low history to repeat itself with only the names changed.
I don’t care what reason you choose in supporting 
Syrian refugees; you should just do it. 
Do it for the common humanity that we share and 
for the pain these families are suffering at the hands of dictatorship and brutal warfare. And, of course, if you 
have other ways to help, share them. Add to my list. We 
cannot look away.
Mia Gettenberg is a UF criminology and law and 
philosophy junior. Her column appears on Mondays.On Saturday, North Korea launched a missile. The at-
tempt failed, exploding moments after launch, but nev-ertheless the missile ﬁ  ring shows that North Korea’s military technology is advancing, whether we like it or not. Even if they do not yet have the technical prowess, 
they are pouring an incredible amount of resources and funding into this program.
As a country, we seem to be divided over whether the presi-
dent’s response to this action was enough. Liberals will tout how President Donald Trump was golﬁ  ng in South Florida the entire weekend and couldn’t be bothered to give a response until Sun-day morning. Conservatives will praise the fact that Trump got China to “crack down” on North Korea, as a recent editorial in a government-afﬁ  liated Chinese publication claimed that oil ship-
ments to North Korea would be “severely limited” if the nuclear 
program continued. It should be noted that this statement, along with claims of 150,000 troops sent to the North Korea-China border occurred before the missile launching, not after it.
We’re not here to devise the perfect solution for dealing with 
North Korea; that’s probably best left to the experts, since the prospect of a nuclear war looms steadily. What we want to ana-lyze is the American reaction to this, across the political spec-trum.
It’s very easy to point at Trump in his cushy Mar-a-Lago 
resort and say that his response is unpresidential. It’s easy to toss around the tax returns again and to say that the only thing Trump is doing is golﬁ  ng. It’s also very easy to hail Trump as some sort of foreign relations hero, who is mending ties with China and telling North Korea who is boss. It’s very easy to fall into the rhetoric that our respective sides are telling us, that websites with names like Conservative Fighters and Occupy Democrats are blasting in all-caps and with ﬂ  agrant buzzwords.
The truth, as always, is more complicated. It won’t be in all-
caps, and it won’t be contained in a single article. 
North Korea’s vice foreign minister, Han Song Ryol, has said 
Trump was “more vicious and more aggressive” than other pres-idents and that his inﬂ  ammatory words are “making trouble.” Though Trump is infamously provocative on Twitter, we have to acknowledge it was not solely Trump’s tweets that provoked North Korea. We are not on good terms, to put it lightly. Trump’s tweets aren’t necessarily the cause, but they are a factor.
Trump had it out for China during his campaign, calling 
them “currency manipulators.” But as North Korea’s only major ally, China plays a pivotal role in these tensions. Exactly how much of a role Trump has played in getting China to “work with us” regarding North Korea is unknown. Perhaps he did single-handedly convince President Xi, or perhaps there was a more drawn-out discussion, or perhaps the Chinese president had made up his mind already. The fact is, Trump is recognizing the powerful role that China plays in foreign relations, and he 
is working with them, instead of labeling them manipulators as 
he did previously.
These are just two paragraphs about a decades-long relation-
ship between the U.S., China, and North and South Korea. This is  by no means a full analysis or solution. It goes to show that we cannot jump to conclusions based on Facebook headlines. Don’t shout “war,” don’t hail heroes or villains, and don’t re-duce a dangerous and complex foreign-relations situation to in-formation you get from comment wars on social media.

When I was 11, I met my grandparents 
for only the third time. I had vague memories of them from my toddler-hood. Here was a grandfather with a crooked smile, a grandmother 
who really liked ﬂ  oral print, but I was keenly aware, even back then, that I didn’t actually know anything about either of them. Now was my chance. I could ﬁ  nally know them as more than photographs and the occasional anecdote from my mother’s childhood.
My mother had coached me on the plane 
ride over, getting me to repeat again and again the words to appropriately greet them. They 
felt heavy in my mouth. Their foreignness gave 
them an almost chewy texture that caught against my teeth and garbled every sentiment I was trying to express. Stewards looked down as they passed by, smiling at my attempts, the badges on their lapels indicating that every single one was bilingual.
And then the moment came and, bowing, I 
greeted my grandparents. They smiled and did 
the same back to me. And that was the end of 
what we could say to each other.Of course, my mother relayed 
some things for me, passing along a compliment about my hair or a remark on how tall I was getting. I realized on that car ride from 
the airport, staring at my mother’s 
animated gesturing as she spoke to her parents in person for the ﬁ  rst time in over three years, that this silence was something I would have to get used to.
We had just moved to Japan, 
and I had come with the expectation that it would be like ﬁ  nding the other half of myself, 
that I would ﬁ  nally learn what it meant to be 
half-Japanese. However, I don’t look Japanese, I don’t speak the language, and though I may hold a passport to the country, I did not be-long there. My identity was about to become “foreigner,” and at the time I couldn’t help but hear that as “outsider.”
Though we’d moved in the middle of sum-
mer, my ﬁ  rst day of school was about three 
months into the Japanese school year. My 
hair was cut to ﬁ  t school regulations. I was stuffed into a bright blue uniform, and I had gotten new black shoes to match everyone else. Yet the dress code didn’t help me feel like less of an anomaly. Instead, with 
all other variables controlled for, it 
was even easier to notice the differ-ences between me and the rest of my classmates.
Each day was an opportunity to 
screw up a little nuance of culture, and each day I learned to talk less 
and to ask fewer questions, to simply be less of a presence so as not to inconvenience the 
few people who spoke English. I was the only 
monolingual kid in my class.
I have lived in other places since Japan, 
other countries where English was not the pri-mary language and where I wasn’t able to talk to everyone I passed by on the street. But, by far, Japan was the most difﬁ  cult to adapt to. Maybe it was my age, maybe it was the people I was around, but most likely it was the fact 
that, going into the experience, I had truly be-
lieved I was going to belong there.Being half-Japanese wasn’t something I 
could connect to in America. It wasn’t some-thing that was noticeable beyond the occa-sional confusion about why my mother and I looked nothing alike. Going to Japan I truly 
hoped that I would come to understand a bit 
what it meant to be Japanese, that I could grab a hold of my heritage as central pillar of my identity.
And although I know many Japanese-
Americans who had very different experiences living in Japan, mine isn’t a particularly heart-ening story about how I gradually learned Jap-anese or made do with some amalgamation of 
the two languages, developing beautiful friend-
ships that would last the rest of my life. To this day, I haven’t had a real conversation with my grandparents.
Living in Japan was not what I expected. 
And although I have come to understand that I will never be Japanese in the way that my mother or grandparents are, I am still proud of my two passports.

Peoples, ran in the Johns Hopkins News-Letter.

In front of about 8,000 people, 
Richard Andre held his breath mo-
ments before his head was pushed 
under water. 
“I’ve been a Christian my whole 
life, but I’ve never fully given my-
self to the Lord,” he said.
Andre, 21, was one of many 
who volunteered to be baptized during Sunday’s Easter service hosted by Greenhouse Church, a group unafﬁ  liated with a Christian 
denomination, in the O’Connell 
Center. Across Gainesville, UF stu-dents and residents gathered to cel-ebrate the major Christian holiday, 
which commemorates their belief 
that Jesus rose from the dead after his cruciﬁ  xion on Good Friday.  
It was the ﬁ  rst time the Green-
house Church, which offers weekly 
services on UF campus, celebrated 
Easter in the O’Connell Center, said Danely Martinez, a coordinator for one of the church’s locations. The 
service’s sermon was given by Pas-
tor Mike Patz, and attendees could be baptized in tubs afterward, a process in which Christians are submerged in water or have it 
placed on them as a symbol of their 
faith. 
“I bet there hasn’t been a lot of 
baptisms in the stadium before,” Patz said.
Lauren Paul, a UF political sci-
ence freshman and member of the Greenhouse church, said the arena Easter service was a way to bring people together. 
“I think it’s important to not se-
clude your religion to a place,” the 19-year-old said. “It’s amazing they gathered everyone here.”
At St. Augustine Church on 
West University Avenue, about 50 
people stood and sang in the warm 
foyer, waiting to pace into the packed main area for the Catholic Easter Sunday mass. 
Father Marek Dzien said about 
800 people attended the 9 a.m. mass, and he expected even more 
at the 11:30 a.m. service. To pre-
pare, they set up an overﬂ  ow room to seat an additional 300. Dzien also led Spanish masses later in the 
day. 
The night before Sunday’s 
mass, Dzien was at the church un-
til 2 a.m. “It’s nothing new,” he said. 
“Like for a doctor to go into the hospital to treat people, or for the teacher to go into the school, it is our job.”
For Aryssa Tognozzi, Easter is 
a time to connect with her family, celebrate life and reﬂ  ect on person-al growth.
Tognozzi, a 22-year-old UF ani-
mal science senior, said despite be-ing away from her family, her col-lege friends help ﬁ  ll the gap. “We’ve all been raised with the 
same values, so it’s easy to talk to them,” Tognozzi said. “It’s easy when you have friends who have been very close, and we’re like 
family.”
Heather Pancoast, the co-direc-
tor at Gator Wesley Foundation, 
a student Methodist group, said 
she hopes students attending the 
church’s Easter service received a message of hope. In her ﬁ  rst year at the church, near University Av-enue and 13th Street, she has seen students feel overwhelmed and stressed. 
“I would hope they walk away 
today feeling lighter, really hopeful 
that there is a bigger plan and there 
is something greater than them,” she said.

Four former UF swimmers are 
trying to raise $250,000 to produce 
a ﬁ  tness tracker for swimmers.
Luke Torres, a  22-year-old UF 
industrial and systems engineering 
senior, helped create the company 
Phlex about two years ago with three of his friends: Marcin Cieslak, Har-rison Gibson and Ryan Rosenbaum. Together the former UF swimmers created a ﬁ  tness tracker to strap to swimmers’ goggles, which will re-
cord data like heart rate, distance, 
sprint times, stroke count and type of stroke being used, Torres said. 
Torres said the company needs 
about $250,000 to begin production, including factory tools, hardware development, app development for data recording on iOS and android devices, product design and market-
ing. Once manufactured, the device would sell for about $200.
“The biggest challenge is money 
because even though we have the knowledge of the swimming indus-
try, we need to pay our engineers to actually develop it,” Torres said. 
From April 6 to April 8, Torres 
represented the group of four in a national undergraduate business competition, e-Fest, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
Phlex was selected to compete 
out of 160 teams from 81 schools that submitted seven-minute videos and presentations describing their business ideas, he said. Phlex’s vid-eo submission showed a swimmer-to-coach relationship and the lack of tools available to analyze a swim-mer’s performance.
The competition, which featured 
keynote speeches from the founder of Best Buy Co. and a judge from the reality show “Shark Tank,” had $100,000, $50,000 and $25,000 prizes, but Phlex did not win any money. 
Gibson, a UF alumnus and CEO 
of the company, said the competi-tion was an opportunity for the team to improve their product. 
“I think that we were exposed 
to a talented panel of judges,” the 24-year-old said. “Criticism from them can only make us grow.” 
Torres said the company’s suc-
cess wasn’t dependent on them winning the e-Fest competition. Phlex has raised about $20,000 from investors, and Torres said he thinks they can raise more.
“It would have accelerated the 
process,” he said, referencing the competition. “But at least we got great exposure.”

EASTER SUNDAY
Crowds of people attend the Easter sunrise service of the Moravian Church on Sunday at the Old 
Salem Historic District in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

Juan Zapata wants to work 
with renewable energy — an in-
dustry currently in turmoil as a result of the new White House ad-ministration’s proposed policies. 
That is in part why Zapata, 
a UF electrical engineering ju-nior, decided to organize a local March for Science in Gainesville 
on Saturday in tandem with simi-
lar marches across the country. While the 20-year-old originally planned to drive to Washington, D.C., for a march in the nation’s capital, he said it was important to help create one in Gainesville. 
“What we’re advocating for is 
evidence-based policy in ofﬁ  ce, for the protection of STEM educa-tion, research and funding,” Za-
pata said. 
The march, organized by lo-
cal groups, will follow a planned 
route from Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Sta-dium on West University Avenue to Bo Diddley Community Plaza, followed by a rally. The march will begin around 11 a.m., and the rally will last from noon until 
3 p.m.“Science is not political,” said 
Andrea Dutton, a UF professor 
who will speak at the rally. A spe-
cialist in the relationship between 
sea levels and climate change, she said her talk will focus on her perspective on the relationship between science and politics.
Zapata said he is expecting 
hundreds to come out to march.
“It’s deﬁ  nitely going to be 
something new,” he said. “But 
regardless, I’m excited for it, and 
my dogs are gonna be with me. And I’m more than happy to be there, front and center.”  Gainesville to ‘March

Parents snickered as she 
walked out.
On one side of the court stood 
a nearly full-grown 18-year-old 
man, facial hair and all. On the other side stood a freckle-faced 12-year-old girl weighing under 100 lbs. Her name was Ingrid Neel. And even at 12 years old, 
she easily intimidated her oppo-
nents.
“By the time she was 12, every-
one knew who she was,” Neel’s 
childhood coach Brian Christian-
sen said. “Ingrid was the girl who 
was always hitting at the top of 
the net, and you’ve got to figure out a way to get past her.”
Having already beaten most 
of the girls in her hometown of 
Rochester, Minnesota, Neel’s 
parents wanted to challenge her. They approached her with the idea of playing for Mayo High School’s boy’s team, Neel imme-diately said yes.
“I said, ‘It’s possible, but 
you’re going to have to be really great,’” said Hildy Neel, Ingrid’s mother. “And Ingrid turned to me and said, ‘Well, I can do that.’”
Drowning in a boy’s uniform, 
the seventh-grader helped lead the Spartans’ tennis team to its first state championship.
While she looked like the out-
sider on the team, this was noth-ing new for Neel. She’s always been different. Whether it was the unusually high amount of tourna-ments she played as a kid or her unconventional style of playing at the net, she was never afraid to stand out. And she always did. Even playing on the No. 1 team in the country at the University of Florida, Neel has continued to differentiate herself from the other Gators. 
Neel started playing tennis 
when she was 4. After three years, she discovered her preferred method of improving: competi-tion. Neel was 7 when she trav-eled to Texas to play in her first tournament. Although she lost both matches, she was inspired to work harder, play tougher and compete more.
At 10 years old, Neel realized 
that tennis was her passion. After coming close to winning a tour-nament in Croatia, Neel traveled to an individual tournament in France where she got revenge. By beating the girl she lost to in Croatia, Neel won the individual tournament title. That was when Christiansen turned to her parents and told them he would help Neel take this as far as she wanted to. Neel said that this was the mo-
ment where she, her parents and her coaches all realized how spe-cial a tennis player she was.
For the next three years, she 
played in local and national tour-
naments and developed her game. 
At 11, Neel attracted the attention of seven-time Grand Slam winner John McEnroe, who said he saw a lot of himself in her. He even asked her to join him at his acad-emy in New York. Although she visited and challenged Johnny Mac when she played him, Neel ultimately declined the offer.
THE FLORIDA WOMEN'S TENNIS 
TEAM LOST FOR THE SECOND 
TIME THIS SEASON ON SUNDAY.
By Spencer Thompson
Sports Writer
With the SEC title on the line, the Gators 
women’s tennis team found itself in a hole. After six consecutive shutouts, Florida went down early to No. 5 Vanderbilt after losing the doubles point for only the fourth time this season. 
It didn't get any easier for the Gators, as 
the Commodores outplayed Florida 4-2 and handed the team its second loss of the season.
Earlier, on Friday, Florida continued the 
dominance that it's shown all season with a 4-0 sweep over Kentucky. However, Sunday was anything but dominant.Vanderbilt got off to a quick start, swip-
ing the doubles point. After splitting the point with a Florida win on Court 2 and a Vander-bilt win on Court 1, it was Vandy’s Christina Rosca and Fernanda Contreras who clinched the point with a 6-4 victory over Belinda Woolcock and Josie Kuhlman. 
Singles play proved to be even more dif-
ficult, as both teams battled back and forth to take control of the game. Brooke Austin struck first with a quick 6-4, 6-4 win over Georgina Sellyn to tie the match at one.
Vanderbilt hit back, as Contreras out-
played Kourtney Keegan 6-2, 6-3 and put the Commodores back in the lead. Playing from behind her entire match, Woolcock was the next victim, as Astra Sharma beat the senior 6-2, 6-4.

By the time Alex McMurtry’s turn came 
on bars, Oklahoma had already clinched 
its second straight NCAA title. 
And though the Sooners had begun 
their celebration nearby in Chaifetz 
Arena, that didn’t stop McMurtry from 
delivering another perfect routine.
“I just wanted to hit that routine,” Mc-
Murtry said. 
“And I wasn’t thinking about a 10, and 
I wasn’t thinking about the scores. I hon-estly kind of knew Oklahoma had edged us out by then, so it was just about leav-ing it all out there.”
It was a fitting way for McMurtry to 
cap off her junior season. 
A season that included four perfect 10s on three different events (floor, bars, vault).
A season where she earned the titles of 
SEC and Scholar-Athlete Gymnast of the 
Year.
And a season where she claimed the 
SEC, NCAA Gainesville Regional and 
NCAA all-around titles in back-to-back-to-back meets.
While teams like Alabama and LSU 
wept on the sideline after their loss, McMurtry and the Gators were smiling as they played in the rainbow-colored 
streamers falling from the rafters follow-
ing their third-place finish with a team score of 197.7.
They were smiling because even 
though they weren’t leaving St. Louis with their fourth national championship UF still smiling after losing titleSEE FEATURE,  PAGE 15
SEE W-TENNIS,  PAGE 14 SEE GYM,  PAGE 14GYMNASTICSin five years, they know the 
future of Florida’s program is bright.
“We still had a great meet 
overall,” senior gymnast Claire 
Boyce said. “I know that the 
girls next year are going to come back with even more fire to get that first place next year.”
The Gators will return their 
entire roster next season with the exception of Boyce, who had to retire midseason  due to injury and will be graduating.
The experienced roster fea-
tures five 2017 regular season All-Americans in Alicia Boren, Amelia Hundley, Rachel Slo-
cum, Kennedy Baker and Mc-
Murtry.
The team will continue to be 
energized by Slocum, the East-ern Michigan transfer who will remain as a staple in the line-up on floor and vault, and by Baker, who had a perfect 10 on floor and two all-around titles 
this season.
Florida will also gain a tal-
ented incoming freshman class 
made up of Alyssa Baumann, Megan Skaggs and Vanasia Bradley. 
Baumann, who had to defer a 
year to focus on rehab because of a lingering elbow injury, highlights the class as a two-time member of the U.S. Senior National Team and 2015 silver medalist on balance beam at the 
U.S. Nationals.
After finishing fourth in last 
year’s NCAA Championships, a 
third-place finish for the Gators in Jenny Rowland’s second year as head coach with five new athletes was a step in the right direction.
“It was an honor and privi-lege to be here,” Rowland said. “This team did a tremendous job of fighting.”
The 2017 season didn’t end 
with the program’s fourth na-tional title.
But the 2018 season has the 
pieces to.
“Next year we will be back,” 
McMurtry said.

tiebreaker second set, Vanderbilt delivered 
the ﬁ  nal blow. In what was a tight game throughout, Sydney Campbell defeated Kuhlman 7-6, 6-4 to clinch the match for the Commodores.
“Vanderbilt played a championship-caliber match today,” coach Roland Thornqvist said 
in a release. “It was like a real SEC ﬁ  nal, and 
they played with better courage than we had 
in doubles. I thought they were stronger than 
we were in singles, also.”
With Georgia’s loss to Texas A&M on Sun-
day, Vanderbilt outright won the SEC regular-season title with a 12-1 conference record. 
Both teams will now turn their attention to the SEC tournament, which starts on Wednes-
day. Vanderbilt, Florida and Georgia have 
earned double-round byes in the tournament 
as the three sit atop the SEC standings. 
Thornqvist hopes that Sunday’s loss will 
fuel the Gators and provide them with moti-vation to play better in the upcoming week. 
He said he’s hoping that the loss to Vanderbilt 
will provide them with an edge in the post-season.
“I told our players that I hope it really mo-
tivates us for next week because for such a big match, it was disappointing that we couldn’t 
raise our level better than this,” Thornqvist 
said. “I think all our players agreed.”

Quick, UF baseball fans, call your 
mothers. Wake the children. Light the 
freakin’ beacons. 
It ﬁ  nally happened.After two months of wondering 
where the team’s offense was, after placing worst in the SEC in several of-fensive categories and after showing ﬂ  ashes of potential that evaporated as 
quickly as they appeared, the team’s 
bats exploded on Saturday. 
And not just a moderate, 10- or 11-
run explosion like three other times this season. Not just little geysers of rock and dirt that gave fans hope. No, this was a bona ﬁ  de volcanic erup-tion, complete with the ﬁ  re the Gators have been lacking. 
The blast came in the form of a 20-
run performance against Vanderbilt 
on Saturday that clinched the series 
over the Commodores with a 20-8 win. 
“Did I see 20 runs?” coach Kev-
in O’Sullivan said in a release. “Of course not. Hopefully this is a step.”
A “step” on offense is something 
the Gators have been looking for pretty much since the season began. 
Entering the series with Vandy, Flor-
ida ranked last in the conference in batting average, slugging percentage, on-base percentage, runs and RBIs.
That’s no longer true for any of 
the categories, with the Gators mak-ing especially large jumps in RBIs and runs, from 14th to 10th. 
“We keep making progress,” 
O’Sullivan said after the game. 
That’s something he’s been say-
ing for several weeks. That his team is getting better with the bats and 
it’s only a matter of time before it all 
comes together. But time is running out. 
The Gators sit at 24-12 with an 8-7 
conference record. Last season, the Gators lost a total — including post-season play — of 16 games. They’re four losses away from matching last year’s total with 19 regular-season 
games left. 
After Saturday’s 20-run perfor-
mance, though, O’Sullivan is feeling a 
renewed sense of optimism. The key now is consistency. 
The Gators have largely lacked 
consistency, and the Vandy series is the perfect example. One day before blowing up for 20 runs on 20 hits, 
Florida lost in a three-hit shutout. 
But entering a midweek game 
against North Florida before facing 
No. 17 South Carolina this weekend, No. 16 UF is hoping that its largest offensive outburst since 2009 ﬁ  nally leads to stability at the plate. 
“Hopefully this is the game that 
gets us over the hump offensively,” 
O’Sullivan said, “but Tuesday’s an-
other game.”

Jenny Rowland
UF gymnastics coachInstead, she decided to work with famed 
coach Nick Bollettieri at the IMG Academy 
in Bradenton, Florida. She stayed there for three years, expanding her skill set by balancing her play at the net with a more conservative approach, before returning to tournament play at 16.
Neel’s ﬁ  rst big tournament win came in 
2015 in Jonesville, Florida, where she won a $10,000 singles competition. This was the ﬁ  rst time Roland Thornqvist, the coach 
of UF’s women’s tennis team, saw her. It 
didn’t take him long to see how good she was. 
“This little kid with sunglasses who came to (the) net on play. It was just like, ‘Wow, I’ve got to watch this,’” he said. “That’s the moment I knew I wanted her on the team. You could see the genius in her.”
After what Neel described as an easy re-
cruiting process, the 18-year-old committed to her ﬁ  rst-choice program and became a 
Gator. Despite being one of the best players 
in the country, Neel continued to set herself apart. Just look at UF’s roster. In an ocean of experienced, veteran upperclassmen, Neel, a freshman, was the only underclass-man. But she embraced the challenge. 
Players and coaches described her tran-
sition on the team as seamless. Neel says the older players accepted her with ease, 
and she began learning from them instantly.
“I feel bad for freshmen who don’t have the opportunity to play with upperclassmen 
because the team is just so mature,” Neel said. “Everyone is so helpful and nice, and I felt really taken under their wings.”
Thornqvist didn’t hesitate to get Neel 
started. Only a week after she enrolled at UF, she was one of four Gators selected to 
compete in the Freeman Memorial Cham-
pionships in Las Vegas. Playing in her ﬁ  rst collegiate tournament against competition from six top-25 schools, Neel advanced to the semiﬁ  nals — farther than any other Gator in the tournament.
Since then, it’s been nothing but domi-
nance for the rookie. Quickly rising to Florida’s No. 2 spot in singles and No. 1 
in doubles alongside junior Anna Danilina, 
Neel has continued to differentiate herself. Through an aggressive style of play, com-bining her crushing overhead ability, touch on volley and fearlessness at the net, Neel has dominated her opponents all season by wearing them down.
Perhaps the shining moment of her 
young college career came in February at the National Indoor Championships. Facing her childhood best friend and fellow Roch-ester native, Neel out-battled North Caro-lina’s Jessie Aney 6-4, 1-6, 6-3 to clinch and give the Gators their ﬁ  rst National Indoor title since 1999.
Since then, Neel has been a critical part 
of Florida’s success. Boasting a 14-3 singles record and a 16-4 doubles record, Thorn-qvist said there’s no way the Gators would 
be ranked No. 1 without Neel, adding that 
her attitude has affected the entire team.
“She doesn’t have to lead because we 
have leadership, but my goodness she’s just happy every day,” he said. “She helps everybody. Coming in as a freshman and the only freshman, it’s not an easy thing to do. But boy, she’s got one of the best attitudes.”
Thornqvist said that he sees Neel as the 
player with the most potential to grow. He expects her pace of play to increase as 
she spends more time training and lifting 
weights. 
But no matter where Neel’s career is 
headed, one thing is sure: Neel will con-tinue to be her own kind of player. It’s what she’s always done. It’s what made her unique. And it’s something she’ll never change.
“I always wanted to stay true to that,” 
Neel said. “I’ve always wanted to be differ-ent and dare to be something that people don’t think can actually work.”

Kentucky freshman Alex Mar-
tens stepped into the batter’s box 
in the bottom of the seventh.
With two outs and the Wild-
cats down, Martens needed a hit to keep the game alive.
That hit never came.Gators pitcher Kelly Barn-
hill retired Martens in just three 
pitches, giving Florida the win.
But striking out Martens 
didn’t just signal a victory — it 
secured Barnhill’s first no-hitter this season and the second of her career.  
Her pitching effort on Sunday 
tipped the game in Florida’s fa-vor, as UF won 2-0 and clinched the SEC weekend series over No. 
21 Kentucky.
After Kentucky’s eight-hit 
effort led to a Wildcats win on 
Saturday, the Gators needed a strong defensive response.
Barnhill provided it.Florida’s ace put on a 
performance in Lexington, striking out 15 and allowing one walk on Sunday afternoon.
In the two appearances Barn-
hill made over the weekend, the sophomore had an impressive 30 strikeouts.
Going into the series, Barnhill 
led the nation with 12.7 strike-outs per seven innings, the most in the country.Barnhill also had 175 strike-
outs on the season going into the series. Now that she has 205 strikeouts under her belt, she should remain No. 1 in strike-outs per seven innings, as well as 
move into the top 10 of another 
category: total strikeouts.
Currently, the player with the 
most strikeouts in the NCAA is Michigan’s Megan Betsa at 266. But Barnhill, who has struck out at least 10 in three of her last four games, continues to move up in that ranking.
Outside of the pitcher’s circle, 
Florida’s defense shaped up on Sunday. After a pair of errors cost it in Saturday’s loss, UF didn’t commit any errors in its 2-0 win.
The Gators also responded 
with a heavier dose of offense in the win. After only connecting 
on a pair of hits Saturday, the 
team had five in the win.
Two of the hits came from ju-
nior Janell Wheaton, who batted in the cleanup spot. In the first inning, she drove 
a ball to left field that brought home fellow junior Kayli Kvistad to put Florida up early.
Then, in the fifth inning, ju-
nior Nicole DeWitt was hit by 
a pitch – the fifth time she has 
been hit in the past four games.
DeWitt reaching base set up 
another at-bat for Wheaton, who hit an RBI single up the middle to send DeWitt home.
Building off DeWitt’s perfor-
mance, the Gators (40-3, 15-2 SEC) will look to improve on 
their offensive game while con-
tinuing their strong defense when they face UCF at home on Wednesday.
“Kelly was ‘WOW’ this week, 
and Janell had a great week for us on offense and defense,” Gators coach Tim Walton said in a release.
“Today was a great road-series 
win against a good Kentucky team.”
