Twelve years ago, 60 bands played scat-
tered shows in small Gainesville bars, parking 
lots and living rooms during Spring Break. 
They were friends, and friends of friends, 
thrown together to share music.
Three months later, the festival sprung up 
again, and its organizer Tony Weinbender said 
it was better. Each year, the trend continued. 
Today, more than 360 bands will take over 
downtown, playing at 20 venues with a pre-
dicted 6,000 people mulling among shows this weekend from countries around the world. 
The Fest? It’s back.“Anytime there was a party, we would 
call it a Fest, like ‘we’re just having a fest,’ you know?” Tony said. “Put a ‘the’ in front of it, 
and now it’s ofﬁ  cial: ‘The Fest.’”
What started out as a gathering of friends 
who wanted to vibe will now pack Bo Diddley 
Community Plaza with merch, beer and inﬂ  u-ential punk bands like the Descendents.
“We always wanted to be a party,” Tony 
said. “That’s what it was — a controlled party, a good party.”
Tony started organizing bands in his home-
town of Roanoke, Virginia, when he was 16, while a singer and saxophonist in a band him-self.
“Our ﬁ  rst tour we got out of high school, 
and two days later, we went and bought a van, 
and we did two weeks of just small shows,” he 
said. “Everyone was really helpful back then, and that’s how I really got into this and why I moved here and why I love Gainesville.”
That band’s name? Swank. Tony said they 
played with other high school groups with similarly “dumb” names, like Integration and Slaphappy.
“I had always done shows since I was 16 
because we had to,” he said. “There was no way for punk bands to play.”
The groups he met that way kept calling 
him for gigs once he moved to town in 2000. 
After quitting the job he moved here for, he 
worked wherever he could while continually putting on live shows.
“There was a coffee shop called Common 
Grounds, and I walked in one day and asked, ‘Hey, do you ever do shows in here?’ And they were like, ‘We have bands kind of play in that 
corner.’”
“They didn’t do shows,” he laughed. “They 
had bands play in a corner.”
Year after year, momentum built. Tony had 
experience organizing volunteer-based, mul-
tiday, multivenue shows from when he lived in Virginia and worked with a college festival called MACRoCK. He liked the vibe, so he in-vited his friends’ bands down to Gainesville 
to play — they brought their friends, and Fest 
was born.
“For the ﬁ  rst several years, we built the 
stage out of pallets and a tarp,” he said. “One 
of the early years, we built a stage and had 
Matt and Kim play there with This Bike is a Pipebomb and Ghostmice, and the stage pretty much broke during Matt and Kim. It didn’t re-ally break, but it was broken.”
By Fest 10, Tony thought to himself, “Holy 
shit. This is big.” Not because of the 100-plus bands, he said, but the reach of the music.
“I think that was the largest attendance we 
had to date. Ten was the year we realized we had such a huge overseas population com-ing.”
The addition of Bo Diddley this year in-
creased capacity, but are his volunteers ready?
“Our team can do this shit,” he said. “Can 
Gainesville do it? That’s the question.”
Loosey’s became an unofﬁ  cial venue the 
day after it opened in 2010.
“We kind of rushed to open for Fest,” said 
owner Danny Hughes. “We couldn’t open to be an ofﬁ  cial venue, but we did what we could.”
Bands had been playing outside behind 
The Top, but an old man in the Pleasant Street neighborhood complained to the police about the noise. Tony mentioned it to Danny, and that night, Loosey’s hosted its ﬁ  rst Fest shows.
“We printed out directional ﬂ  iers and put 
them up 10 minutes before doors,” Tony said. “The whole show moved, and it was great.”
For the ﬁ  rst year, bands played on the ﬂ  oor 
in front of a piece of cardboard; there wasn’t a stage yet, but no one minded.
“Especially with punk rock music, there’s a 
huge DIY scene,” Danny said. “A lot of bands actually prefer playing these intimate shows.”
Before he opened Loosey’s, he’d been to 
Fest and was a huge fan of the music. Owning a venue only elevated the experience, because now he can talk to artists one-on-one and see 
bands weave in and out of his venue, enjoying 
other groups and catching up with friends.
“You’re watching this band that no one has 
ever heard of,” he said. “It’s you and 10 other people, and the guy next to you is the lead 
singer of your favorite band.”When Jacob Harn turned 18 on the cusp of 
last September, Fest was on his mind.
The 18-and-up music festival lets local fans 
volunteer to run the shows in exchange for the proverbial golden ticket, a three-day Fest 
wristband.
“I’d been wanting to go for years through-
out high school,” he said. “I’m glad I got to be a 
part of the whole thing instead of just going.”
Jacob volunteered at :08 downtown on 
the Friday of Fest, checking wristbands at the 
door. Volunteers can pick the job, venue, day and time they help out, which gives ﬂ  exibility 
to see favorite bands.
“Being at :08 was cool because I got to listen 
to bands that I wasn’t as stoked on,” he said. “I 
got to help out and listen to the music from a 
really good vantage point.”
At the festival’s ﬁ  nal volunteer meeting last 
week, Tony faced a ballroom full of help — a 
motley group of tattooed, pierced, not-tattooed, bald, dreaded, beer-drinking volunteers. 
“You would never think the Gainesville 
Police would be a fan of a punk-rock festival,” Tony said, “but they’re a fan of our work eth-ic.”
Projecting his voice across full rows of seats 
and those standing in the back, he continued.
“This is what I look forward to most during 
Fest weekend — seeing all of your wonderful faces.”
Tony reﬂ  ected on the family and the con-
nection that Fest brings through a shared love of music. No other town can boast the DIY na-ture and success of a music festival run solely 
by volunteers.
 “This is the core of Fest,” he said. “This is 
why we can keep doing this for 13 years.”
Jacob said one of the best parts about volun-
teering was meeting people from all over the globe.
“It’s crazy because a lot of them were from 
the other side of the States and even the other 
side of the world. I met people from Germany, 
from Japan, from Australia.”
These simple acquaintances start out as the 
guy standing next to you in line sharing a ciga-rette who happens to love your favorite band 
and turn into lifelong friends.
Not only did Jacob met new people while 
volunteering at shows, but he also reconnected with old friends while seeing their favorite 
bands.
And in between gigs, he said Fest-goers can 
explore other parts of downtown.
“Most of these people would never hear of 
Gainesville, but Fest showcases Gainesville in 
a way that you normally wouldn’t get to see it: People can go try Flaco’s, or grab something at Pop A Top.”
But undoubtedly, the best part of the week-
end will always be the music. Jacob saw one of his favorite bands, Ceremony, play at The Wooly last year and ended up crowdsurﬁ  ng over the tossing waves of the pit.
“It was funny —  I was actually wearing a 
white shirt, and after the show I went outside in the light and I saw some shoeprints on my back,” he said. “It was crazy. It was amazing.” 
When Tony was in the seventh grade and elementary and middle 
schools started to combine, he was introduced to punk. His good 
friend Chad Smith visited his cousin in West Virginia and came back with a collection of punk vinyls and a skateboard.
“His cousin was older and had dreads and a skateboard. And he was like, 
‘Did your mom give you any money?’ and Chad said, ‘Yeah, I got like 20 
or 30 bucks,’ so his cousin said, ‘Alright, let’s go to the record store.”
When Chad got back, he and Tony made a mixtape: Firehose, Fu-
gazi, Bad Brains, Dead Kennedies, Minor Threat. These bands opened 
a new dialogue for him.
“The majority of people we knew were racists, and to listen to a band 
singing about ﬁ  ghting that, or ﬁ  ghting sexism, or ﬁ  ghting police brutal-
ity, or just being young skateboarders... I don’t know how many times I’ve been thrown in to sitting in front of the sheriff, being interrogated without my parents, without a lawyer, sitting with green hair and baggy pants.”

Three-year-old Mary Scheppler trick or treats at Alpha Chi Omega’s “Frozen”-themed sorority house for a Ghouls, Goblins and Greeks event Thursday evening.

Mummies, zombies, 
ghosts and ghouls will haunt 
the halls of the Reitz Union 
tonight during GatorNights’ 
Haunted Horror Reitz event.
GatorNights staff will host 
free Halloween events for 
students starting at 8 p.m. 
Maggie Sutton, a gradu-
ate assistant for GatorNights, 
said Simpliﬁ  ed Entertain-ment was hired to set up a 
professionally built haunted 
house.
“It’s really going to be a 
creepier and more terrifying 
experience,” the 22-year-old 
said.
Last year’s Halloween 
event tallied up about 1,000 students, and Sutton said she 
expects that number to dou-
ble for tonight’s event.
Pro Psychic Readings, a 
local psychic medium, will 
provide students with palm 
readings and fortune telling. 
Creepy treats by Classic 
Fare Catering will be served throughout the night. 
Students looking to es-
cape the haunted house can head to the Reitz showings 
of “The Purge: Anarchy” and 
“Monsters University.” 
Dressing up in costumes 
is optional and encouraged, but wearing masks is not al-lowed.
Olivia Sperry, a UF Eng-
lish junior, said GatorNights is a good way for people who live on campus to get involved with UF events.
“I love Halloween, and 
this seems like a free version of something like Hallow-een Horror Nights,” Sperry, 
21, said. “It would be a good 
thing to bring friends to.”GatorNights hosts

strate active involvement in the commu-
nity will receive this award.
Businesses eligible for this award ad-
vocate, donate and volunteer time toward community causes.
The Center for Leader-
ship and Service awards students and nonproﬁ  t organizations through-out the year for their local community service proj-
ects.
“We realized that out 
of our annual impact 
awards, we were highlighting students and nonproﬁ  ts, but there weren’t many things we were doing to highlight businesses,” said Angela Garcia, director of community engagement and service-learning at the Center for Leadership and Service.
Kristin Joos, the Center for Entrepre-
neurship and Innovation’s Social Entre-preneurship and Sustainability Initiative director, said Garcia invited the group to 
collaborate on the award because of its

Three food trucks will be serv-
ing a not-so-traditional Shabbat 
dinner at UF Hillel tonight — just 
one example of established student 
events incorporating the trendy mobile vendors.
“I think the youth really like it,” 
said Peter Sturgeon, owner and operator of the Soup to Nuts food truck, which will be parked at UF Hillel at 8:30 p.m. “It’s nice to go wherever other people are instead 
of having brick-and-mortars, 
where you’re stuck in one spot.” A major draw to the student 
community is the ability for food truck vendors to be creative with their food, he said. Sturgeon’s 
truck will serve different types of 
grilled cheese at the monthly din-ner hosted tonight, varying from traditional to dessert to gluten-free.

It’s time to reconsider your 
“Conquistabros and Navajos” 
themed mixer.
Representatives of multicultural 
and diversity organizations on 
campus met Wednesday night to 
discuss the societal implications of cultural appropriation and hyper-sexualization for Halloween.
Organizations involved includ-
ed the Women’s Student Associa-tion, Black Student Union, Hispanic Student Association and Students Taking Action Against Racism.
Stephanie Boothby, a UF an-
thropology graduate student who teaches a gender and sex roles cross-cultural course, said she be-lieves cultural appropriation stems from a lack of awareness.
“(Cultural appropriation) is 
when someone takes aspects of a certain culture and takes it out of context, not realizing the implica-tions of mocking certain types of cultural symbols, dress and tradi-
tions,” Boothby, 26, said.
Representatives from BSU dis-
cussed the signiﬁ  cance of blackface, 
referencing an instance two years ago, when two UF students re-ceived national attention for wear-ing blackface at a fraternity party.
UF public relations junior and 
WSA president Diamond Delancy 
said it’s an important issue to dis-
cuss before Halloween so people understand how harmful some costumes are to certain minority groups.
“People just want to chalk it up 
as a joke, but why is it that my cul-ture is a costume and yours isn’t?” Delancy, 19, said. 
Students Taking Action Against 
Racism representatives suggest 
that it is ideal for students to talk to 
people from the culture a costume represents and gauge their opin-ions before mistakenly offending someone.
“It’s important to educate UF 
students on the impact of their decisions before they make them so nobody is offended, and every-
one can have a happy Halloween,” 
Delancy said.

UF was ranked among the 
top 100 universities in the 
world by U.S. News and World Report, paving the way for the university’s preeminence plan.
U.S. News and World Report 
released its ﬁ  rst global universi-ties ranking, classifying the top 500 universities in the world.
UF spokesman Steve Orlan-
do said the ranking has identi-ﬁ  ed the university as a preemi-nent university.
“We’ve been named among 
the top 10 percent universities in the world, which is certainly where we want to be,” he said. “That also helps our preemi-nence plan.”
UF was listed as No. 53 
among other top-100 universi-ties, such as Pennsylvania State University at No. 52, KU Leu-
ven in Belgium tied with UF at 
No. 53 and Karolinska Institutet (Institute) in Sweden at No. 55.
Institutions were ranked 
based on factors such as global research reputation, publica-tions and number of cited pa-pers, distinguishing these glob-al rankings from the U.S. News Best Colleges and Best Gradu-ate Schools ranks.
Orlando said the ranking is 
one of the stated goals of UF’s preeminence plan, UF Rising, created by the university to establish itself as one of the na-tion’s best public research uni-versities.
“We know parents and stu-dents look at those rankings,” he said. “We also need metrics to chart our progress as a uni-versity.”
The university looks to other 
public research universities as a way of tracking its progress each year, Orlando said.
UF also tracks its progress 
by comparing itself to schools such as the University of Cali-fornia, Berkeley and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
“From public universities 
we were ranked 14, so that’s what we’re looking at,” Orlan-
do said. 
UF was ranked No. 48 in 
national university rankings 
last year by the U.S. News and World Report. 
Sirah Mora, a UF interna-
tional studies junior, said she’s noticed the impact of UF Ris-ing, along with the university’s growing research projects.
“I think we’re deﬁ  nitely 
growing as a university in terms of the amount of research that we’re doing,” Mora, 20, said. “There’s deﬁ  nitely a lot of medical research and engi-neering research projects going around, and I think it is helping our overall rank as a school.”UF ranks 53rd world-
wide, ranked 48th nationally last year
“We know parents and 
students look at those 
rankings. We also need 
metrics to chart our 
progress as a university.”

Peter Sturgeon, 26, stands outside his food truck, Soup to Nuts, as he prepares 
for an event at First Magnitude Brewery. 
Twenty local businesses will be selected to receive the award
“The intent of the Purpose 20 Award is to both cele-
brate such inspirational and impactful local entrepreneurs 
and social entrepreneurs, and in doing so, hopefully raise awareness of their work,” Joos said.
The center first discussed the idea for the award in the 
spring. Over the summer, center representatives met with Advantage Publishing’s Business In the Heart of Florida magazine.
The winning businesses will be showcased in the April 2015 issue of Business In the Heart of Florida.
“We hope that coverage of these 20 award recipients 
will continue to educate and inspire our readership, while highlighting the positive impact that the 20 businesses have on our community,” said Erica Brown, director of communications and marketing for Advantage Publish-ing.
Businesses can be nominated or apply for the award 
until Nov. 14.
A committee will select the winning businesses in De-
cember. The committee will be made up of prominent 
members of the local community and representatives 
from the three sponsors. 
“It’s exciting to see so many local business leaders so 
engaged and invested in doing well and doing good,” Joos said. “ These businesses all believe in using the power of business as a force for good in the world.” purpose , from page 1

Within the past three months, Hillel has 
seen a massive transition in staff and philos-
ophy, said Rabbi Adam Grossman. To him, 
religion is not just faith — it is comprised of physical, emotional, spiritual and social com-ponents. 
“People know food trucks,” he said. “It’s 
very, very new in Gainesville and I think provides students a unique opportunity to get something pretty chic that they otherwise couldn’t get.”
Since Hillel started this event, Grossman 
said they have served more than 400 students.
“We are a student-driven organization, and that’s our niche,” he said. “Everything we try 
to do is really for the student.”
In addition to UF Hillel, Gator Growl — 
billed as the largest student-run pep rally in 
the nation — incorporated food trucks this year to help obtain a more festival-like atmo-
sphere for its 91st annual show.
“It’s cooler than just catered food,” said UF 
economics freshman Joeli McKee, who attend-
ed Growl. “You get a lot of more options, too, 
and it’s probably cheaper to do it.”
In comparison to last year, Growl atten-
dance increased by almost 2,000 people.
Yet despite its success, the trucks were not 
met without problems.  
Many attendees reported food lines that 
stretched across the field, and some showgo-
ers felt they missed performances to wait for food.  
“I’d say the lines (were) really long,” Mc-
Kee said, “and they’re a little bit more far off from the rest of everything.”food truck , from page 1“It’s exciting to see so many local business

A group of UF scientists have part-
nered with other scientists from more 
than a dozen universities to improve the quality of fruit. 
In the fall 2014, the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture disbursed the first installment of a five-year, $10 million grant to the research project dedicated to the improvement of fruits, including strawberries, blackberries and peaches.
The 35 scientists working on the 
research initiative are growing disease-resistant fruits. They are modifying DNA to prevent viruses and improve the quality of the fruits.
“Growers spend 
a lot of money using different means to 
protect their plants 
from diseases, in-
cluding spraying either organic or 
conventional pesticides or using other measures,” said Vance Whitaker, the leader of the UF strawberry breeding program. “We’re trying to combine the disease resistance that the growers really need with the fruit quality that people really want in the produce that they buy.”
UF is using the grant from the Na-
tional Institute of Food and Agricul-ture’s Specialty Crop Research Initia-tive to create a database where anyone can access the information.
Kathryn Stofer, a UF research assis-
tant professor with the agricultural edu-cation and communication department, said the database will allow scientists to communicate with broader audiences who may have different perspectives.

� THE CONFERENCE STARTS AT 9 A.M.

The Levin College of Law will host a panel today on 
domestic violence victims who find themselves on the 
wrong side of the law. 
The panel is part of the “Survivors” Defendant/
Victims of Domestic Violence Conference, which began Thursday. Starting at 9 a.m. today in the Advocacy Cen-ter, speakers will present stories on victims of domestic 
violence. 
Linda A. Osmundson, the executive director for 
Community Action Stops Abuse, will kick off the first 
presentation, followed by presentations from attorneys Joshua Safran and Kevin Cobbin. The speakers will then 
participate in a panel discussion at 1:45 p.m., with clos-
ing remarks beginning at 2:45 p.m.
On Thursday, the conference featured a viewing of 
the documentary “Crime after Crime: The Battle to free 
Deborah Peagler.” Safran answered questions after the 
documentary on Peagler, who was allegedly involved in the death of her husband — who forced her into pros-titution and abused her — and subsequently served 25 years in prison.  
Monique Haughton Worrell, the associate director of 
the Criminal Justice Center, said the conference focuses on women who ended up in the criminal justice system as a result of the violence committed against them.
“We think it’s important that people realize that peo-
ple who are victims of violence can also be defendants,” Worrell said.
Ashley Martell, a second-year UF law student, said 
she thinks the law school picked a great focus for the 
conference this year.
“I’m glad the law school is hosting an event like this.” 
Martell, 23, said. “I’m proud to be a part of a school that 
holds events on current, sometimes controversial, legal 
issues.” Law school hosts

� STUDENTS FOR THE NEW URBAN -
ISM ARE RUNNING THE EFFORT.

UF’s Students for the New Urbanism is 
bringing pedestrian safety to the local com-
munity’s attention. 
The students used nonpermanent marking 
spray chalk to make a crosswalk at the inter-section of Northwest First Avenue and North-west 16th Street to promote pedestrian safety, said 19-year-old president Ethan Hudgins.
The sustainability and the built environ-
ment sophomore said New Urbanism is a na-tional organization geared toward promoting community building and awareness of envi-ronmental and economic issues within local communities.
Hudgins started the UF organization in 
April to promote New Urbanism to a larger audience. It plans to create pedestrian-friendly streets between downtown and campus.
Alexa Rossi, 22, depends on her bicycle for 
transportation. The UF religion senior said she 
appreciates that the group is promoting safety 
and community building, but she believes more crosswalks will not solve all the safety issues in the community.
“There are a lot of bikers and drivers on 
the road who don’t pay attention,” she said, adding that more crosswalks won’t prevent pedestrians from cutting through traffic.
The UF organization has more projects 
lined up to encourage pedestrian safety, such as painting intersections and installing bicycle ramps. Hudgins said cities all across the na-
tion are making great progress.
“Gainesville is already doing a great job,” 
she said.UF group promotes pedestrian safety, environmental awareness

A Gainesville man was arrested 
Wednesday afternoon after police 
said he sexually assaulted his girl-friend’s 9-year-old relative. 
The young victim told family 
members and police that while 18-year-old Emanuel Deron Durr was visiting his girlfriend Monday night, he used his fingers to penetrate the girl’s vagina at about 10 p.m., Gainesville Police spokesman Ben Tobias wrote in an email. 
The girl did not tell anyone about 
the incident until the following day, and her family reported it immedi-ately, Tobias said. 
When Durr was arrested, of-
ficers also found about half a gram of marijuana. He was arrested on charges of sexual battery on a minor and marijuana possession. His bond is set at $760,000.

Four men were arrested early 
Thursday after police said they stole electronics, hand tools, modeling kits, a box of darts and some ammo out of a parked car. 
The group — including 20-year-
old Jajuan Lee Pate, 26-year-old Lashawn Jerome Lewis, 19-year-old Jalen Jacori Sheppard and 23-year-old Cortez Mondrain McCabe — knocked over a scooter at Campus View Apartments at about 12:30 
a.m., Tobias said. A witness saw 
them entering a vehicle in the park-ing lot, taking things out and putting them in the trunk of another car. 
They then drove away, but the 
witness gave police the vehicle’s tag number. When police saw the car enter Oxford Terrace II Apart-ments, the men quickly drove away after they noticed the officers. They were then stopped at 600 SW 3rd St. 
Police searched the car and found 
the stolen items, which included an iPad and two hand sanders. 
All four men were arrested on 
charges of grand theft and burglary on an unoccupied vehicle. All bonds are set at $45,000.

America faces many fearsome issues
Millennials these days are constantly being fed the 
narrative that the state of our nation is getting worse and worse. The media is constantly tell-
ing us to be afraid of the latest, most terrifying threat to America. Despite all the sensationalism, there are many things I am concerned about in our country, our state and my personal life. In the spirit of Halloween and all things spooky, I’d like to take some time to brieﬂ  y discuss a few of them.
First, we have no national plan to combat climate change. 
All we have are proposals. In June, the Obama administra-
tion proposed new rules to reduce carbon emissions from 
fossil fuel power plants. This ambitious plan proposes to cut emissions by 30 percent in the near future. What makes the future of climate policy scary is that the Environmental Protection Agency will set the requirements in June 2015.
If both Houses of Congress are run by Republicans, 
as many political pundits expect will be the case after the upcoming election, the power of the EPA will be severely diminished. In the state of Florida, the Department of En-
vironmental Protection has lost its teeth. The department 
worked with polluter companies instead of cracking down on them. Gov. Rick Scott vetoed a measure to buy back en-vironmentally sensitive land through the Florida Forever Program. It is frightening that Scott could get re-elected, and these anti-protection policies might continue for an-other four years.
Another scary thing to consider is that the total U.S. stu-
dent loan debt was about $1.2 trillion in May 2013.
This massive amount of debt has combined with a poor 
job market to swell the millennial unemployment rate to 12.2 percent. As a result, more college graduates are now living at home than ever before. In 2012, 36 percent of mil-lennials — those between the ages of 18 and 31 — lived at home, a signiﬁ  cant increase from recent years. Congress and the Florida Legislature have shown no willingness to help curb the cost of higher education by prohibiting preda-tory lending and halting tuition hikes. Instead, Florida law-
makers have made matters worse by cutting Bright Futures 
scholarships in half and cutting K-12 education budgets. In 29 states, you can be ﬁ  red for being gay or lesbian. In 34 states, you can be ﬁ  red for being trans-gender. In these states, including Florida, there are no laws explic-
itly prohibiting employment dis-
crimination for LGBT individu-als.
White Americans are using 
illegal drugs at a rate ﬁ  ve times 
higher than minority groups, yet black Americans are sent to jail at 10 times the rate of whites. Furthermore, divisions within the black community harm the prospects for racial unity and reconciliation.
With the issues of climate change, divestment in educa-
tion, discrimination in the workplace and more, there is in-deed a lot to be afraid of. These issues directly affect my life and the lives of millions of Americans. I, like many other college students, have very little idea of what I want to do with my future. For many other people, this indecision can contribute to depression and anxiety, which in turn, dimin-ishes their ability to function and excel. Fortunately, there are some positives also worth mentioning.
We are no longer in a recession, and our gross domestic 
product is increasing. Ten million more people have afford-able health care because of the Affordable Care Act. The national unemployment rate is down to 5.9 percent, mar-riage equality is sweeping the nation, and the U.S. is still governed by a twice-elected black president.
The millennial generation is largely apathetic and pes-
simistic about the future of a country that is perpetually ﬁ  ghting wars, warming the planet, polarizing its people 
through political parties and borrowing money to help 
pay the country’s bills. Despite this cynicism, I believe that millennials are smart and capable enough to tackle these problems head on and leave the Earth better than the previ-ous generations have done. Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke the truth: “There is nothing to fear but fear itself.”

On Monday, The Weather Channel co-founder and me-
teorologist John Coleman appeared on Fox News in an interview with anchor Megyn Kelly. In an open letter he 
penned in October, Coleman made the absurd claim that “there 
is no signiﬁ  cant man-made global warming at this time” and no 
scientiﬁ  c evidence to support the concept. “Thank you for hav-
ing me on your program,” Coleman said at the beginning of the segment. “A climate skeptic can rarely get on TV.” Apparently, Coleman doesn’t watch much Fox News, where being a climate-
change denier is essentially part of the job description. We’re 
giving a head-in-the-sand DART to John Coleman.
This Wednesday was National Cat Day. To celebrate this 
treasured national holiday, Uber teamed up with the American 
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and popular 
cat-meme website Cheezburger to offer an UberKittens special 
in six major American cities. For $30, Uber users were able to 
request a “kitten car,” including a 15-minute cuddle session with a furry feline. All proceeds went to local shelters, and Uber matched all the contributions made through the special offer. 
We can only hope that Uber brings cuddly kittens to Gainesville 
some day. In the meantime, we’re giving a creative-cat-cuddles 
LAUREL to Uber.
Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-SC,  is the archetypal rich, white, 
male Republican. He’s also a ubiquitous presence on Sunday morning political shows, despite offering no remarkable ex-pertise on any particular subject and having the personality of a 3-week-old Hot Pocket. Given Graham’s elite status, it was somewhat unsurprising when recordings emerged of Graham at a country club gathering saying, “white men who are in male-only clubs are going to do great in my presidency.” Fortunately, Graham has about as much chance of ever becoming president as Adam Sandler does of becoming pope. However, Graham’s statement does provide insight into the priorities of elite, white, male Republicans. An aren’t-you-supposed-to-represent-ev-
eryone? DART to Lindsey Graham.
American reality television shows are replete with individu-
als who engage in annoying, self-centered and often down-right despicable behavior. One of the most notorious examples of low-quality reality television is TLC’s “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.” The show features child beauty pageant competi-tor Alana “Honey Boo Boo” Thompson and her mother, June “Mama June” Shannon. Mercifully, TLC announced this week that “Honey Boo Boo” will at last be canceled. The reason for the cancellation is extremely disturbing: According to NPR, allegations recently surfaced that “Mama June” has resumed dating an old boyfriend who was convicted of molesting an 8-year-old related to Shannon. It is clear the last thing Ameri-can television needs is any more “Honey Boo Boo.” A better-
late-than-never LAUREL goes to TLC.So we can’t pretend this week was the best, with Ebola panic

Happy Halloween! Oct. 31 is ﬁ  nally here, 
and it’s time to celebrate. “Halloween-town” viewings, pumpkin carving 
and scary stories are all great, but the best part of this holiday is deﬁ  nitely dressing up.
If you’re anything like me, I’m sure you 
spent a long time picking out your costume. It has to be creative, funny and, assuming you’re not celebrating in a family-friendly manner, it has to show a little skin.
Hopefully, you’ve come up with the perfect 
outﬁ  t by now. And good news: All your hard work can get double the use with something that’s a little more treat than trick — role-play.
Role-play is a great way to try new things 
and experiment while still enjoying the safety and comfort of hooking up with your partner. Plus, you get the added beneﬁ  t of feeling like you’re with a totally new person, if that’s some-thing you’re into.
It’s especially great for long-term relation-
ships or hookups that have gotten a little stale.
While role-play is totally doable the other 
days of the year, it’s easier on Halloween be-cause you’re already dressed up. A lot of cos-tumes even have built-in roleplaying options.
Dressing up like a schoolgirl? Enjoy your 
chance to be a little more submissive. Spankings for late homework should deﬁ  nitely be imple-mented to really get into character. Cop and robber, doctor and patient, ﬁ  reﬁ  ghter and cat — stuck in a tree, work with me here — are all great couple costumes that look good at parties and work well in the bedroom.
Dressing up, whether just for some trick-or-
treating or for some door-to-door action in bed, is a great way to release your inhibitions. Look-ing the part gives you reason to act like your al-ternate persona.
There’s no reason to feel self-conscious be-
cause for those few minutes — or more, if you’re really lucky — you’re not you. You’re Be-yoncé or the Slutty Pumpkin or a sexy Ebola nurse.
If you’re normally 
on the shy side, wear-ing a costume is a great excuse to try some-thing new and act like 
you normally wouldn’t. Wearing the costume all night will build anticipation for what’s to come — and who’s to come, for that matter. 
As with any other sex act, make sure you and 
your partner are both OK with it. If your part-ner doesn’t seem that into the roleplaying, ask if they want to continue, or go back to a point where they were more comfortable.
If your roleplaying is going to be fully in 
character, it might also be a good idea to decide on a safe word to use. This is especially impor-tant if you’re dressing up as something like a dominatrix, which might make for more hard-core roleplay than you’re used to. Make sure the safe word is something you wouldn’t normally say. Feel free to think of Halloween-themed phrases.
If you’re still wary of trying out some role-
playing so soon, save your costume and pull it out when you feel comfortable. Even just parts of it — a wig, handcuffs, a stethoscope — can make things more exciting than your standard Plain Jane sex.
If you do want to try something new, drink 
some witch’s brew, watch “Hocus Pocus” and get everything out of your costume you can by doing a little roleplaying. It’ll make this Hal-loween one to remember for you and your … boo.

opinions@alligator.orgOne step forward, two steps 
back — that is an accurate summary of the progress Gov. 
Rick Scott’s education policies have yielded.
On Monday, Alligator columnist 
Nick Eagle drowned readers in a tsu-nami of carefully-selected statistics combined with misleading statements supporting Scott. Eagle asked Florida voters to look at the track record of both candidates, as well as each of their agendas. Eagle also took it upon himself to detail each of their track re-
cords through lenses that betrayed a 
fairly obvious conservative bias.
Eagle juggled a couple of political 
footballs, including the economy and the Affordable Care Act. He started by comparing job growth statistics under the two candidates. However, he quickly acknowledged that he was comparing apples and oranges be-
cause each candidate worked in dis-
tinct economic conditions, with Scott on the more fortunate half of the re-cession. So, he dropped the topic.
Eagle then brought attention to 
the candidates’ differing views on the Affordable Care Act — a piece of leg-islation that, frankly, is completely ir-relevant to this gubernatorial race be-
cause neither candidate can override 
the federal government’s legislation. Still, Eagle snuck in his 2 cents — or rather, Scott’s — and moved on.
Once it was apparent that these 
political hot potatoes were leading him nowhere, Eagle found a topic and clung to it: Education. “Education???” I thought, as I read the col-umn. Scott has arguably done more 
damage to 
Florida’s public education system than 
any recent governor — with FCAT champion Jeb Bush right behind.  
Eagle used a series of misleading, 
out-of-context statistics to portray Scott as a savior of Florida public edu-cation. First, Scott inconsiderately cut education spending by $1.3 billion. 
Then, the governor had a miraculous 
epiphany and realized he had to in-vest in education. And now, Florida’s education budget is at its highest point ever! Scott is a genius! Celebrate!
It would be much more under-
standable if money was the only is-sue in the education system under Scott. Money is an issue for all of us, 
really. But there is more. Scott’s re-
cent approval of the Student Success Act, a law that pays teachers based on performance, is a dangerous piece of legislation that targets the very core of our education system — our teachers.
This law introduces annual teach-
ing contracts into the very fragile en-vironment that is a school. I encourage 
Gators to think critically and gather all 
the facts before they head to the polls on Election Day. Oh! And when you get into the ballot box, please bubble in completely, so Johnny won’t have to.

Pope Francis said evolution 
and creationism do not contra-
dict, causing a controversy this week that was largely unwar-ranted, said UF theology pro-
fessor David Hackett.
“This is due to the lack of 
knowledge of the Catholic 
Church,” said Hackett, who teaches American Religious History and Sociology of Reli-gion.
The pope was addressing 
the assembly of the Pontifical 
Academy of Sciences on Mon-
day when he said, “Evolution requires the creation of beings that evolve.”
But Hackett reminded ob-
servers that the pope is an in-dividual, and his views are not necessarily those of the church.
The Catholic Church has never taken a position on cre-ationism, he said.
The church’s original beliefs 
are not creationism, nor are they doctrine, he said.
“It’s the opinion of the 
pope,” Hackett said. “He is not condemning the other.”
And though his announce-
ment may seem groundbreak-ing, Hackett said it’s been said before.
Pope Pius XII had a similar 
viewpoint in the 1950s, accord-ing to the encyclical Humani Generis, his published letter to the church.
In 1996, St. John Paul II en-
dorsed Pius’ statement.
“His acceptance is actu-
ally not anything new,” said Valeria Nasiri, a 21-year-old UF resource economics senior and Catholic Gator club mem-ber. “It’s been that way for a while.”UF prof: Pope’s nod

� “I STILL FEEL GOOD ENOUGH, AND 
I HAVE ENOUGH JOY.”
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
PORTLAND, Ore. — A terminally ill 
woman who expects to take her own life un-
der Oregon’s assisted-suicide law said she is feeling well enough to possibly postpone the day she had planned to die.
Brittany Maynard said in early Octo-
ber she expected to kill herself Nov. 1, less than three weeks before her 30th birthday. She emphasized that she wasn’t suicidal, but wanted to die on her own terms and re-served the right to move the date forward or push it back.
While she hasn’t completely ruled Satur-
day out, Maynard said in a new video she feels she has some more of her life to live.
“I still feel good enough, and I still have 
enough joy — and I still laugh and smile 
with my friends and my family enough — 
that it doesn’t seem like the right time right now,” she said in the video.
“But it will come because I feel myself 
getting sicker. It’s happening each week.”
Maynard said she was diagnosed with 
incurable brain cancer earlier this year. Be-cause her home state of California does not have an aid-in-dying law, she moved to Portland and has become an advocate for getting such laws passed in other states.
Maynard’s story, accompanied by pho-
tos from her pre-illness wedding day, broke hearts across the globe while igniting a na-tional debate on the issue of physician-as-sisted suicide.
One opponent is Philip Johnson, a 30-
year-old Catholic seminarian from the Dio-cese of Raleigh, North Carolina.
He, like Maynard, has inoperable brain 
cancer and is plagued by headaches and sei-zures.
After learning of Maynard’s choice, he 
wrote an article explaining his view that

A women-initiated, grass-roots peace and 
social justice organization will host a series of 
events next week to protest the use of drones overseas and violence in the Middle East.
Medea Benjamin, author and co-founder of 
CodePINK, will discuss empowering women globally in the peace movement Thursday at 6:30 p.m. in Ustler Hall
She will present on her latest book, “Drone 
Warfare: Killing by Remote Control,” on Nov. 7 from 6 to 9 p.m. at Wild Iris Books at 22 SE Fifth Ave.
A reception and book signing will follow 
both events, which are sponsored by the UF women’s studies department, the National 
Organization for Women, the Civic Media 
Center and the Samuel Proctor Oral History Project.
“I think we need to focus much more on seeking political solutions to global problems because the military ones are not work-ing,” Benjamin said. “If you look at the last 13 years, the 
U.S. has not crushed ex-tremist groups. It’s only al-lowed them to proliferate.”
On Nov. 7 from 11 a.m. 
to 2 p.m., CodePINK and 
Students For Justice in Palestine will host a discussion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the Mennonite Meeting House, located at 1236 NW 18th Ave.
CodePINK, in conjunction with Occupy 
Gainesville and Veterans For Peace, will then lead a protest against drone warfare starting on Main Street from 3 to 5 p.m.
Scott Camil, a Vietnam War veteran inter-
nationally known as the “Winter Soldier” for his exposure of war crimes, is a member of Veterans For Peace.
“The world should be allowed and able to 
solve their problems without murdering each other,” Camil said. “To me, war is just orga-nized murder.”

UF RecSports is keeping up with the pace 
of college gyms around the nation. 
College recreational facilities are keeping 
track of visitor habits and adjusting their pro-
gramming and activities based on their find-
ings, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
And UF is no exception.
RecSports is following who uses its facili-
ties and how frequently they do so. 
“When we opened the Student Recreation 
& Fitness Center in 1991, on day one over there, we started counting how many students were in each area of the building each hour,” 
said David Bowles, director of the department 
of recreational sports at UF. “Now, in the last four years, we’ve been able to do more because of the software that we have.”
Pamela Hightower, the assistant director for administrative services at RecSports, said that the amount and frequency of students us-ing the facilities is recorded every time a stu-dent enters a gym or interacts online with his or her GatorLink account.
Every person is only counted once, no mat-
ter how many times he or she visits the gym.
Hightower said there were more than 
36,000 unique visitors to the facilities in 2013-2014. That only includes the Student Recre-ation & Fitness Center, Southwest Recreation Center and the Broward Outdoor Recreation Complex, but not Lake Wauburg or any of the recreational fields on campus.“We can see the trends and behaviors,” 
Hightower said, “so we adjust our program-ming so that we’re not investing money in something that doesn’t seem to be what stu-dents are behaviorally interested in, and we put it into something that they are.”
RecSports is using the data to improve stu-

With eight underclassmen list-
ed on Florida basketball’s current 
17-man roster, the Gators will rely 
greatly on young talent in the wake 
of losing four starting seniors to the class of 2014.
Leading the underclassmen are 
freshman Chris Chiozza from Mem-phis, Tennessee, and Devin Robin-son from Chesterfield, Virginia.
Chiozza, the No. 42-ranked pros-
pect in the class of 2014, is known as 
a capable point guard. 
He averaged 15 points and eight 
assists per game during his senior 
season. 
Robinson, a 20th-ranked incom-
ing freshman, averaged 24 points, 10 rebounds, two assists and three blocks per game his senior year.
Coach Billy Donovan said he be-
lieves Chiozza and Robinson are just the guys for the tough job in front of the Gators.
“Those guys have been good so 
far. I think the biggest thing is they really have been able to sustain the intensity. That’s what you always worry about is them being able to do that,” Donovan said of Chiozza and 
Robinson. 
“But both of those guys have a 
long way to go, especially defensive-
ly. Way, way behind. And I wouldn’t say any further behind than any freshman that’s come in here, but in terms of having some veteran guys back and those guys really be-
ing two new guys in relationship 
to (Michael) Frazier and Eli Carter and even (Alex) Murphy, guys that have been here for a year, going into 
about 10 days of practice you can see 
a huge gap between those guys and the veteran guys.”
Robinson has recognized his high 
basketball IQ as his major strength 
upon arriving at UF.
“I’m like a sponge,” he said. “I 
just take everything in and just use 
what I learned. I think that’s to my 
advantage.”
But Robinson understands there 
are areas in which the top-recruit 
needs to improve in. 
Namely defense, as Donovan 
mentioned.
“It’s real tough on D. It’s very dif-
ferent from high school,” Robinson said. “The close-out concept is dif-
ferent, put your hands up. In high 
school, shots would go up slower. It’s a lot quicker right now, so it’s a lot harder on defense.”
Though Chiozza believes he’s 
been adapting well to the Florida basketball program, he agrees with Robinson in that defense has been a tough spot.
“It’s been really difficult, actually. 
A lot more difficult than I thought it would be,” Chiozza said. “We’ve been watching a lot of film and he’s been preaching it in practice. It has come a long way. We’re doing pretty 
good so far, and we picked up on a 
lot of stuff we’ve never done before. The speed is still up there, it’s dif-ficult. Overall, I think we’re doing 
pretty well and picking up on every-
thing pretty good.”
In the 2013-2014 season, the Gators 
managed impressive defensive feats, including 269 rebounds and 56 steals 
in the postseason alone. 
In the record-breaking season, 
Florida managed 36 wins and only 
allowed three losses. 
Two weeks into practice, Dono-
van is now facing the challenge of rebuilding that defensive dynasty, with fresh but talented meat at the helm.
“It’s a combination, we as a coach-
ing staff have got to do a good job breaking things down and teaching, but they also need to understand, 
that convicted and committed part,” 
Donovan said. 
“Like for Devin Robinson and 
Chris Chiozza, right now, their heads are absolutely spinning, 
they’ve never even thought about 
half the stuff we’re trying to make them do, and actually what even goes into winning at this level. And 
that’s not their fault, they are young 
right now.”FRIDAY, OCTOBER 31, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Walt Disney World may be the “happiest place 
on earth” for the youth, but for the four Gators at 
the 2014 USTA Collegiate Clay Court Invitational, 
it’s too early to tell if they’re under the Magic King-
dom’s spell.
Three of the four Gators won in the singles 
Round 1 on Thursday — the first of the four-day 
tournament. 
Though less than half of the Gators headed 
south to represent their No. 23 ranked team, only 13 
schools are competing this weekend in the smaller-scale tournament.
Ranked No. 37, Florida State University is host-
ing the third annual tournament at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex. 
Following UF and FSU, is No. 55 Miami and No. 
69 Central Florida.
No. 5-seed junior Diego Hidalgo defeated Uni-
versity of South Alabama’s Juan Troglia in straight 
sets, 6-1, 6-2. 
The Ecuador native is paired to play Matt Barry 
of Penn State today in singles second round.
Senior Richard Brej defeated Virginia Tech’s 
George Cartledge after dropping the second set, 7-6(4), 3-6, 6-1. 
Brej will play Clemson’s No. 1-seed Hunter Har-
rington today in singles second round.
Freshman Chase Perez-Blanco defeated Univer-
sity of Miami’s Wilfredo Gonzalez after losing the 
first set, 4-6, 6-1, 6-1. 
Today Perez-Blanco will play Georgia Tech’s 
Carlos Benito in the singles round two.
Freshman Jordan Belga dropped to Florida State 
University’s Marco Nunez, though not without a fight when he cleared second set, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.  
Belga will play Virginia Tech’s Florian Nicoud in 
consolation singles today.
Florida’s two doubles won round one Thursday. Tandem Belga and Perez-Blanco defeated Vir-
ginia Tech’s Jai Corbett and Joao Monteiro in “A” doubles, 8-6. 
UF’s second pair and No. 4-seed in “B” doubles 
Brej and Hidalgo defeated Stetson University’s Gra-ham Ball and Chester Espie, 8-4.
Today Belga and Perez-Blanco play Columbia 
University’s No. 4-seed Richard Pham and Mike Vermeer in the second round “A” doubles. 
Brej and Hidalgo will play University of South-
ern California’s Rob Bellamy and Eric Johnson in the second round of “B” doubles today.
“Playing on a clay court is much different than 
playing on a hard court,” volunteer assistant coach Scott Perelman said in a release. 
“We got three good days of really good practice 
on the clay in Gainesville, which helped us prepare for today. 
“Our competitive effort today was excellent. We 
must continue to improve each and every day as we 
get closer to the spring season.”All four Gators advance through 
first round of Clay Court Invite

CROSS COUNTRY
BEN MURPHY
Alligator Writer @B_murph4
With seven ﬁ  rst timers in the event, the Florida 
men’s and women’s cross country teams will be 
viewed as an underdog today in Tuscaloosa, Ala-
bama, at the 2014 SEC  Championships. 
For the Gators, motivation is something the team 
will not need. They have one goal: to succeed and 
win this meet.
Coming off a poor showing at their last meet in 
Wisconsin, the men and women have changed their training regimen in preparation for this event.
“We’ve certainly backed them off (the training),” 
coach Paul Spangler said. 
“Heading into Wisconsin we had some great 
workouts, but we had a little bit of overtraining. Some of the athletes went in really, really fatigued and we had a few athletes that were sick. We’ve 
backed them off, so the volume of the workouts has 
really decreased. We recognize that the training and  sickness really affected us at Wisconsin. They’ll go into SEC’s pretty fresh.” 
Only one men’s team will head into the Champi-
onships ranked, perennial favorite Arkansas. 
The Razorbacks round out the bottom half of the 
current NCAA rankings with the 23rd spot in the country. 
On the women’s side Arkansas comes in as the 
5th ranked team in the country followed by Vander-bilt who is No. 14 in the nation. 
This will be the ﬁ  rst time all season that the 
Gators will have to face off against the Razorbacks.
“It’s a good conference,” Spangler said. “You look at the men’s side and the women’s  side Ar-kansas is favored to win both. You ﬁ  nd out on race 
day that  anything can happen. As long as we go in 
there and compete and give 100 percent that’s all 
we can do and I think anything is possible.” 
With NCAA Regionals looming, the Gators know 
that both their teams are going to need standout performances this weekend if there is any lasting shot at saving their NCAA championship dreams. 
For Florida, rebounding will be the toughest 
part of this week’s race. The conﬁ  dence level will be 
questionable for both the men and women’s sides 
after struggling in their last outing.
“We took a hit after Wisconsin,” Spangler said. 
“Certainly coming out of that meet we  didn’t have the performance that we wanted to. I told the team 
before, you ﬁ  nd out a lot about a person’s character 
when they get knocked down, they stay down and get right back up. That’s something that we need to do, refocus, get back up and compete with 100 
percent on Friday.”Young, deep Florida rosters set to 
compete in SEC Championship today

To the Florida Gators, Jacksonville’s Hart 
Bridge is more than just a scenic route on the 
way to their annual matchup with the Georgia Bulldogs.
Rather, the 3,844-foot bridge towering over 
the St. John’s River is the ﬁ  nal checkpoint before reaching their destination: EverBank Field.
The excitement builds. And once they cross 
the bridge, the sights never fail to disappoint.
“You go over that bridge and then all of the 
sudden you see a bunch of Gator fans, a bunch of Georgia fans,” redshirt senior offensive line-man Chaz Green said. “It’s crazy because you don’t see it until you get all the way over the 
bridge. Your heart starts pumping. You ﬁ  nally 
know it’s about that time.”
But for the last three seasons, crossing the 
bridge has not brought the results the Gators hope for when everything is said and done.
Florida (3-3, 2-3 Southeastern Conference) 
has lost the last three games against Georgia (6-1, 4-1 SEC) by a combined score of 64-49. Each game was decided by 8 points or fewer.
“We’ve had our opportunities to get off the 
ﬁ  eld defensively; we’ve had opportunities to go for a possible tie in another situation and we haven’t done it,” said UF coach Will Muschamp, who played safety at UGA from 1991-1994. 
“Credit their team and what they’ve been able 
to do. We certainly had our opportunities.”
The rivalry will be renewed on Saturday at 
3:30 p.m., and Muschamp is still seeking his ﬁ  rst win after crossing the bridge.
The fourth-year UF head coach is 0-6 in the 
Florida-Georgia rivalry in Jacksonville and 0-7 in the series as a whole (the 1994 game was played in Gainesville).
If Muschamp does not come out with the 
win on Saturday, he would become the ﬁ  rst Florida coach to lose at least four straight games to Georgia since Charley Pell dropped ﬁ  ve straight to the Bulldogs from 1979-1983.
“We need to get a win, that’s the ﬁ  rst thing,” 
Muschamp said. “But you know again it’s one of the great rivalries in college football. … To be in a stadium that’s split 50-50, and the im-
portance of the game to both universities is very 
special. So it’s obviously very important.”

Florida’s season is heading in a tailspin. After starting off with two wins, UF has 
dropped three of its last four games, most re-cently a 42-13 defeat to a Missouri team that ac-crued less than 120 yards of total offense.
But unlike last season, when Florida echoed 
a “woe is me” mentality during its seven-game losing skid to close out a 4-8 run, this year’s ros-ter is not letting its record get the best of it.
“We’re a hungry team and we still are,” line-
backer Jarrad Davis said. “I don’t feel like that’s changed at all. Last year, I feel like it was later in the season when everybody knew it was ac-tually over. I feel like that’s when that sense of giving up came in, but I don’t feel that will ever come in this season.”
But on Saturday, there will be a fresh face 
commanding Florida’s offense, hoping to sal-
vage the rest of UF’s season. Gone from the 
starting lineup is quarterback Jeff Driskel.
Taking his place is true freshman Treon Har-
ris, who is starting his ﬁ  rst career game in what is Florida’s most crucial contest of the season.
Despite his youth, his teammates can see his 
maturity and development on the ﬁ  eld.
“He’s deﬁ  nitely a calm kid,” offensive line-
man D.J. Humphries said. “That’s one thing I 
noticed about him. Coach yells at him or any-
thing like that, he never gets rattled or nothing like that. He comes back to the line and calls the play the same way every time.”
The up-tempo, fast-paced offense that was 
supposed to come with the entrance of offen-sive coordinator Kurt Roper has fallen ﬂ  at as turnovers have limited the Gators’ ability to UF, UGA renew rivalry in Jacksonville Saturday

The world’s largest outdoor cock-
tail party is ﬁ  nally back.
Florida and Georgia rekindle their 
annual rivalry on Saturday, and we 
here at the alligatorSports Brand 
Picks Column fully embrace that you 
Gator fans down a couple (read: a lot) of cocktails before watching this game.
For the Gators, this game is cloud-
ed with too many questions to pro-vide them any sense of comfort.
What if Florida’s offense fails to 
execute with Treon Harris as the 
starter?
What if the Gators fail to stop Nick 
Chubb and the ‘Dawgs’ run game?
What if Will Muschamp fails to 
win a game in this series again?
We could continue this list, but 
you’ve probably been asking your-
self these questions all week.
So sit back, grab a cocktail and en-
joy what’s to come.
Now onto the picks!
Through 70 picks this season, we 
have a four-way tie for ﬁ  rst place, but 
that doesn’t mean much as those four only have a record of 35-35.
Representing alligatorSports at 
the top of the leaderboard are staff writers AKA “brother and sister” 
Jonathan Czupryn and Morgan Mo-
riarty, who argued like long-lost 
siblings during our weekly podcast regarding sleeper picks for the Col-lege Football Playoff while Richard Johnson and I sat back and enjoyed the show. How about we just call it down the middle and say that both Notre Dame (Zoop’s pick) and Bay-lor (Morgan’s pick) both make the 
playoffs in double-sleeper fashion. 
Or nah?
Continuing his success this sea-
son and joining Czupryn and Mori-arty at the top of the leaderboard is the Orlando Sentinel’s Edgar “Ke-Ke” Thompson, who has mentioned time and time again his infatuation toward Florida’s starting safety. Re-
ally, Edgar? Whatever happened to

move down the ﬁ  eld.
And with UF facing a UGA team that 
leads the nation in margin of turnover 
per game (1.86) and has given the ball up a nation-low four times, minimizing 
mistakes is key for the Gators.
“We have the ball security period ev-
ery single day that we’ve been doing for 
two years now,” Muschamp said. “So we changed up some things we were do-ing as far as that was concerned, but just continuing taking care of the football. You can’t turn it over six times and win. It’s not going to happen.”

Barring an upset victory come Satur-
day, Florida’s SEC East title dreams are out of reach.
Instead of worrying about what they 
can’t control, the Gators are playing for themselves. Their pride. Their will. 
And after this week, that might be all 
they have to play for.16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, OCTOBER 31, 2014
PICKS , from page 15
FOOTBALL , from page 15Gators playing for themselvesRounding out the top of the group is 
Inside the Gators’ Landon “Might come 
later to grab them” Watnick, who harped alligatorSports editor Jordan McPherson for Florida’s media guides from 1991-1994 to 
write a story that nobody probably gives a 
damn about. Come on, man! Didn’t you take enough from the ofﬁ  ce when you took the TV back? 
Sitting in ﬁ  fth place with a 33-37 clip is 
247sports.com’s Thomas “Ropin’ in Roper’s wife” Goldkamp, who Florida offensive co-ordinator Kurt Roper pointed to and said, “Help me out there, OK. I’ve got a great wife” 
when talking about how football can affect a 
coach’s personal life. Is there something you want to tell us, Goldkamp? Is Roper’s wife really better looking than “most of us”?
And now we have a three-way tie for 
dead-ass-last with the trio posting an equal-ly piss-poor record of 31-39.
First on that list are a duo of “Gurley 
Girls” in  alligatorSports editor Jordan McPherson and alligatorSports.org Editor Richard Johnson, who both chose UGA run-ning back Todd Gurley as their tailback of choice over UGA freshman Nick Chubbs. ... Or at least that’s their logic behind it.
And rounding out the dead-ass-last group 
is Gator Country’s Nick “Bad Start” de la 
Torre, who was so damn horrible early on 
this year that having the second-best record from last week still couldn’t get him out of dead-ass-last this week. But don’t get your hopes down just yet, Nick. If your fortunes look similar to the Gators’, I guess you’ll be alright.3, FEST 13 WRAP � ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, OCTOBER 31, 2014
