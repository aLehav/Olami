  As tuition increases, scholarship pro-
grams slip away and the unemployment 
rate hovers around 9 percent, the overall rate of students defaulting on their col-lege loans has increased at the highest rate in two decades.
  The most recent results, released in 
September by the U.S. Department of Education, reﬂ  ect an increase from 7 percent in the 2007-2008 ﬁ  scal year to 8.8 percent in the 2008-2009 ﬁ  scal year, making this report the ﬁ  rst to evaluate students’ abilities to repay loans during the recession. 
  The state of Florida has a default rate 
of 10.5 percent. Arizona has the highest default rate — 16 percent — and North Dakota and Montana had the lowest with 3.4 percent.
  UF has a default rate of 1.9 percent 
with 126 students in default on their loans. This was up from 1.5 percent in 2008.
  Florida State University’s default rate 
is 3.4 percent and the University of Cen-tral Florida’s is 4.4 percent. The school with the highest default rate in Florida is Trendsetters of Florida School of Beauty More students defaulting

  For the second year in a row, Alachua Coun-
ty had the highest combined property tax rate in the state of Florida, and UF’s presence in Gainesville has a lot to do with it.
  According to an annual report by the Flor-
ida Department of Revenue, for ﬁ  scal year 2010-2011 Alachua County topped the 52 coun-ties with a millage rate of 23.73 mills. St. Lucie County was second at 23.1634 mills.
  This means Alachua County residents pay 
$23.73 for every $1,000 of property value. 
  Millage rate is determined by dividing the 
amount of money the local government wants to spend by the total number of taxable dollars, said Ed Crapo, the Alachua County property appraiser.
  Only 50.71 percent of property in Alachua 
County is taxable. State- or government-owned entities like UF, Santa Fe College and govern-ment buildings don’t pay property taxes, Crapo said. 
  Neither do churches or nonproﬁ  t organi-
zations. However, these properties still have a taxable value that must be picked up by hom-eowners and private property owners. 
  For students or renters, property tax is re-
ﬂ  ected in their rent, he said.
  The County Commission sets the property 
tax each year as it is one of the two ways the county government is funded, the other being the county’s portion of the state shared sales tax.

entities like the Alachua County School Board, the library district and municipal and water  Report ﬁ  nds Alachua County

  Results of the fall Student Senate elections are still 
up in the air after a UF Supreme Court appeals hearing Monday night.
  The court ordered an investigation into the elections 
process and postponed the Senate’s vote to validate the elections. 
  Election Commission chairman Grant Schnell and the 
other commissioners will investigate the elections and present a report to the UF Supreme Court by Sunday evening. The court will meet tentatively Sunday night to determine how to act based on the investigation report.
  The Election Commission upheld the results at a 
hearing on Friday . Schnell pointed this out to the justices but acknowledged that some different evidence and ar-guments were presented at Monday’s court hearing.
  “I have a hard time seeing how it would be any dif-
ferent,” Schnell said.
  The court will allow Students Party members, Su-
pervisor of Elections Toni Megna and members of the Student Senate to submit questions to be answered in the investigation.
  Questions are due to the justices by Wednesday 
evening. The court tentatively scheduled a meeting for SG elections 
to undergo investigation

One year ago, 20-year-old Shelby Krantz 
used to drive everywhere. 
But after Krantz, a natural resource 
conservation junior, learned more about 
the effects of pollution on the environ-ment, she decided to start biking instead of driving. 
Come Oct. 26, Krantz will be among the 
hundreds of students to participate in Sus-tainable UF’s annual One Less Car Day.
One Less Car Day is part of an ongoing 
campaign to encourage UF students and faculty to use alternative transportation.
Transportation accounts for about 10 
percent of the university’s carbon foot-print, created by harmful emissions that affect the environment, said 25-year-old Ashley Pennington,  outreach coordinator for the UF Office of Sustainability.
The goal of One Less Car Day, she said, 
is for UF to be carbon-neutral by 2025.
“It’s not our office’s goal; it’s UF’s goal,” 
Pennington said.
During One Less Car Day, the Office of 
Sustainability hopes to raise awareness on alternative transportation and the causes of climate change. Rather than drive to school, students will be encouraged to walk, bike or take a bus.
Gainesville is the 16th friendliest bike 
city in the United States, Pennington said.
“It’s a great way to get 
exercise, and it’s a lot bet-ter than sitting in traffic,” she said.
Krantz, a member of 
Gators Going Green, said students can make a dif-ference by taking simple 
steps like turning off the air before leav-ing home, using reusable water bottles and taking the bus instead of driving to school.
Pennington said she encourages stu-
dents to visit the Sustainable UF website for more information on One Less Car Day and other campaigns students can get in-volved with.
“There are plenty of ways to get in-
volved,” she said.
As of Friday afternoon, about 550 peo-
ple had committed to using alternative transportation on campus on One Less Car Day, Pennington said.

Artistic students met the first 
Monday of October with a dancing 
gold crystal and a flash mob on the Reitz Union Colonnade.
The UF College of Fine Arts 
and the Fine Arts College Council hosted an arts and cultural oppor-tunities fair Monday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. on the Reitz Colonnade in celebration of National Arts and Humanities Month. 
With about 70 campus and lo-
cal clubs and organizations partici-pating, the fair offered students a chance to find unique ways to con-nect with the art community. 
Rachel Berry, a development 
program assistant in the dean’s of-fice in the College of Fine Arts, said this is the first National Arts and Humanities Month that has been officially recognized on campus. She said that many students spend their years at UF without engaging in the arts. 
“It’s easy not to realize how 
much the arts, humanity and cul-ture have to offer at the universi-ty,” Berry said. 
Fernando Masterson, 19, tele-
communications sophomore, was surprised to see the presence the arts and humanities community has on campus. 
“I had no idea there were so 
many opportunities to get involved with the arts.”
UF President Bernie Machen 
was among several speakers at the fair. Machen noted the importance of art in the life of the campus and local community. 
“It [National Arts and Humani-
ties Month] is a reminder to all of us here at UF that the arts are the electrical current that will light up the future of our university and the city of Gainesville,” Machen said. “You can’t have a vibrant, innova-tive community without a vibrant, artistic community. It just doesn’t work.”
The month’s events include the 
Art Bash, the Florida Writers’ Fes-tival and the Conference of the So-cial Sciences. 
The Swamp Symphony on Fla-
vet Field will end the celebration and formally kick off Homecom-ing events on Oct. 27.

tions. The location will be posted in the SG Office in the Reitz Union at least 24 hours in advance.
UF Chief Justice Matt Michel and Associate 
Justices Georgia Buckhalter, Tim Mason and Cecily Welsh also debated whether to mandate a re-vote, mandate a partial re-vote or instruct the Student Senate to implement stricter regulations for the next elections cycle.
Welsh said she was concerned that stu-
dents who might not have realized they were incorrectly listed under District E until they reached the candidate list would not have been able to change their district at that point.  
The justices also questioned exactly where students’ voting addresses were pulled from, whether poll workers received complete proce-dures from Megna and whether Megna made students aware of address requirements.
Students Party members Jonathan Ossip and 
Gillian Leytham presented evidence to have the Senate’s vote to validate the results postponed. 
“The Supreme Court made the right deci-
sion,” Ossip said. 
Senate Allocations Committee Chairman Joe 
Pardo, who represented the Senate, and Megna responded to the Students Party’s petition.
Pardo said during the hearing that any 
discrepancies in results stemmed from user error.  
After the court’s decision, Par -
do said he was satisfied and 
considered the investigation an appropriate measure.
“The investigation granted 
by this court will yield neces-sary information for the court to confirm the elections re-
sults, which I expect it will,” he said.
After both sides presented their arguments 
and witnesses, the justices deliberated for about two hours. 
“I think we can say this [elections process] 
wasn’t good enough,” Welsh said.AppeAl , from page 1Court to discuss need for re-voteUF default rate relatively low 
and Barbering with a 28.5 percent de-
fault rate.
Rick Wilder, interim director for the 
Office of Student Financial Affairs, said UF’s default rate is “minuscule” when compared to other schools across the country —   something he attributes to 
the success of UF graduates in finding 
jobs after graduation.
In the 2008-2009 school year, 37,816 
UF students took out about $216 mil-lion in loans. In the 2009-2010 school year, 38,812 students took out about $221 million in student loans — num-bers that Wilder said he expects to con-tinue to increase. As a result, he said he expects the numbers of students in debt from loans also to increase over the short term. 
Students who take out loans must 
go through entrance and exit counsel-ing with SFA, he said, to ensure that they are educated about what loans entail.Once students with loans graduate 
or leave school, they have six to nine months, depending on the type of loan, to begin repayment. Students who fail to make these payments may face fines, garnished wages, legal action or a low-ered credit score.
Wilder said financial aid advisers 
typically recommend that students first seek other sources of funding, such as grants, scholarships or work programs.
“Loans are kind of a last resort,” he 
said. “But unfortunately they’re becom-ing more and more popular as other sources of funding are decreasing.”
In addition to reductions in Bright 
Futures funding, the Academic Com-petitiveness Grant and the National Science and Mathematics Access to Re-tain Talent grants were eliminated. Pell Grants also faced cuts.
For the 2011-2012 school year, Wild-
er said UF saw a total of $20 million cut from grants and scholarship programs.
“I don’t foresee it getting better in 
the near future,” he said. loAns , from page 1“I had no idea there were 
so many opportunities to

County Commission approved 2.3 percent increase last week
management. 
The School Board and the county government’s general 
fund are the two tax rates that play the largest role in determin-
ing the overall millage rate.
The School Board of Alachua County had the highest prop-
erty tax rate of any county, with a millage rate of 9.107 mills. 
This tax rate increased in 2008 with Alachua County voter 
approval.
When looking at the property tax that goes to the county’s 
general fund, Alachua County drops to 16th with a millage rate of 8.3763 mills. 
Last week, the County Commission approved a 2.3 percent increase in property taxes for the 2011-2012 fiscal year, which will bring the tax up to 8.5696 mills.
County Manager Randall Reid said Alachua County is often 
compared, unfairly, to that city out west in Leon County.
Like Alachua, about 57 percent of the property in Leon 
County is taxable, as it is home to entities like Florida State Uni-versity and Tallahassee Community College. 
The two counties have similar population sizes — 247,336 
residents here and 275,487 in Leon.However, Reid said, Leon County has had a one-cent sales 
tax in place for about 30 years, an effort that brings in about $35 million dollars annually to the county.
“It is really tragic to me that we don’t enact this,” he said.Alachua County voters have historically voted against the 
one-cent sales tax, though Reid said it may be on the ballots again in 2012.
Right now, property taxes are the main source of funds for 
county entities like the sheriff’s department and county proj-ects like the construction of parks or road repairs, something the revenues from a supplemental sales tax could benefit, he said.
“People want lower taxes,” Reid said. “Well, to do that, 
they’ll have to decide what type of county services they want to get rid of.”TAx , from page 1

In her Ocala neighborhood, 
60-year-old Becky Saucier discov-
ered several feral cats wandering the streets. One male cat started to antagonize her cat for territory. 
Since 2006, 15 stray and feral 
test cats have been observed by researchers from the UF College of Veterinary Medicine in hopes of finding a means of controlling stray cat populations. The answer was found in GonaCon, an im-munocontraceptive vaccine that targets a key reproductive hor -
mone in the brain called GnRH.
UF and the Department of 
Agriculture have pioneered a sin-gle-dose vaccine with long-term effects on fertility in adult female cats, according to a UF news re-lease. The college was issued a $250,000 grant by the Morris Ani-mal Foundation to complete the study to find a nonlethal alterna-tive to controlling feral cats, lead researcher Julie Levy said.
Of the cats treated with Gona-
Con, 93 percent showed infertility results for a full year and at the end of the fifth year, 27 percent were found to remain infertile.
“When stray animal popula-
tions are treated, it is not essential that every individual animal be infertile,” Levy said, “just that a large proportion of them are.”
Saucier said she doesn’t nec-
essarily agree with the treatment  but she thinks it is a step forward.
“This new development in 
contraception for cats would cer -
tainly be better than killing them,” she said.Cat contraception

A UF-led research team was awarded a $6.3 
million grant Thursday to genetically enhance the 
chemical responsible for creating the scent of Christ-mas trees to make transportation biofuels. 
The scent of pine trees comes from terpene, a 
chemical that is naturally produced and stored in the tree. The liquid terpene can be directly blended with transportation fuels like gasoline.
“Research tells us that terpene production and 
storage capacity are controlled in large part by pine tree genetics,” said John Davis, co-principal investi-gator of the project. “This means that we can grow varieties with higher amounts of terpenes, which can be used as renewable biofuels.”
The U.S. Energy Department’s Advanced Re-
search Projects Agency-Energy awarded the three-year grant. The agency is a program within the En-ergy Department that is investing in renewable and domestic production of energy, including biofuels.  Davis, along with Gary Peter, the principal investi-gator of the project, are professors at the UF School of Forest Resources and Conservation. Their col-laborators for the project include personnel from the University of California-Berkeley, the National Re-newable Energy Laboratory and ArborGen LLC, a leading commercial supplier of enhanced seedlings to the forest industry.  
UF will receive about $2.4 million of the grant. 
The rest of the $6.3 million goes to the collaborators’ portion of the work. 
Existing pine tree varieties have a terpene content 
of 3 to 5 percent. The researchers hope to develop varieties that accumulate more than 20 percent. 
At this level of terpene content, pine trees can 
produce about 100 million gallons of fuel from about 25,000 acres of planted pine, Peter wrote in an email. 
“If our technology is successful, then we can di-
rectly produce in a plant,” Peter wrote, “and extract a biofuel that will be more than two times lower cost than ethanol derived from maize starch and with a much higher energy content.”Researchers receive grant to study 
use of pine tree chemical in biofuels
“This means that we can grow varieties 
with higher amounts of terpenes, which 
can be used as renewable biofuels.”

79% NOMonday’s question: Did you strip down 
for the Great Underwear Dash?Today’s question: Do you ever find yourself so busy 
that you cannot do your job?
Death Justified?
Did U.S.-born terrorist 
deserve a trial?
Does the War on Terror create an exception for killing 
U.S. citizens without trial? 
On Friday, Anwar al-Awlaki, an alleged senior 
al-Qaida leader, was reportedly killed in Yemen by a U.S. drone strike.
Although al-Awlaki has been linked with planning vari-
ous terror attacks, including the attempt by the Christmas Day “underwear bomber,” he is still a U.S. citizen. 
Numerous al-Qaida leaders have been taken out by drone 
strikes throughout the War on Terror, but al-Awlaki is the first U.S. citizen to be killed as a direct target. 
This is a significant blow to al-Qaida and could mean the 
beginning of the end to taking down the terrorist group for good  — at least as a fully operational organization. There 
will always be terrorists, but it appears that the U.S. govern-
ment is slowly picking off the masterminds. 
Do the ends justify the means? It would appear that everyone agrees that if a U.S. citi-
zen takes up arms against his or her own country that they should be treated as an enemy. 
But should there also be a high standard of evidence to 
prove this? 
Yes, there was evidence of al-Awlaki speaking out against 
the United States and supporting terrorist attacks. 
But does his citizenship provide him with a higher stan-
dard of evidence required to execute this direct attack? 
Some are saying al-Awlaki’s citizenship has opened the 
door for the president to target Americans on a whim and could be an expansion of executive power that goes too far. 
Others are saying that at least the courts should have 
been presented with evidence and granted a warrant to the government to take him out. 
Civil libertarians are saying that he deserved to face trial 
for his crimes, like terrorist Timothy McVeigh. 
So instead of giving our opinion, considering that the 
Editorial Board is divided on this issue, we want to hear yours. 
This is a very important issue dealing with foreign poli-
cy, civil liberties and the War on Terror. 
You can send us a letter to the editor, or, if you have a 
lot to say on the matter, you can send us a guest column. Please do not submit anything longer than about 650 words, if you can. 
Submissions can be sent to opinions@alligator.org. Please include your name, major and class year in your

week or next week, so try to have them submitted soon. 
Thank you in advance for your submissions.Vegetarian options should not be feared
Why are people scared by vegetarian food choices?
I’ve been a vegetarian for almost seven years, 
but I still get weird looks when I order a protein 
that didn’t come from an animal.
I get asked things like “You’re getting what? What is 
‘tempeh’? That sounds gross.”
My usual, witty retort is to claim that “you” sound gross, 
so there. (My comebacks can’t all be winners, guys.)
So what if I want to order tempeh instead of beef? Tem-
peh is a lot like a veggie burger in texture and taste; it’s normally made from combining soybeans and a grain, like barley, and then pan-searing or deep-frying it into a sort of patty. 
I often get it as a burger or as a topping on salad; you can 
use it exactly as you would ground beef. Plus, you can’t go wrong with deep-fried anything, am I right?
Sometimes, when ordering Chinese or Japanese food, I’ll 
want to get tofu instead of my usual shrimp. (I’m a pescetar -
ian, which means that I still choose to eat fish. Some might call that cheating, but it’s a necessity for me.) Once again, I’ll get funny looks from friends.
“Ew, tofu? What even is that? I hate tofu, it tastes 
gross.”
I’m going to let you in on a secret: Tofu only tastes gross 
if you cook it incorrectly. Tofu has no flavor naturally. It tastes like whatever you cook it in or with. So, I’m sorry if whatever restaurant you last ate tofu in 10 years ago made it taste weird, but not all tofu is like that. I promise.
Over the summer, I became an Iron Chef of tofu. Trust 
me, there are a ton of different ways to cook and prepare it, and they are all delicious.
When I tell people (people whom I have known for 
years) that I’m going to make chicken nuggets, they still do a double take.
“Sami, but that’s chicken!”Cue me shaking my head and rolling my eyes.“No, guys. It’s fake chicken. I’ve been a vegetarian the entire time you’ve known me. Get with it.”
There are a few brands in gro-
cery stores of vegetarian foods that provide alternatives to tradi-tional protein choices. The Morn-ingstar line is probably my favor -
ite. It sells ground beef, chicken nuggets and sausage substitutes as well as premade meals. They 
taste a lot like the original version when cooked the right way — even my dad thinks so! He’s the one who does the cooking most of the time at home, so he’s had practice.
This brings me to a rule of thumb for non-vegetarian 
friends of vegetarians: If it’s sold in Publix, you’re not al-lowed to be afraid of it. It’s not too crazy or wacky if it’s found in a chain supermarket. You can find all sorts of veg-etarian proteins for sale there if you look.
I think I get such weird looks because humans suffer 
from a fear of the unknown. When presented with some-thing strange or different, our first reaction is to not trust it. This is probably a smart strategy around, let’s say, sharks. When it comes to delicious food, though, there’s no need to recoil with disgust and then make fun of me for eating.
I don’t make fun of you guys for eating red meat. While 
it’s not the direct cause of heart disease or colorectal can-cer, the high amounts of cholesterol aren’t doing anyone any favors. Of course, it’s always worse to combine a diet of heavy red meat with other processed foods and sweets. That’s just asking for trouble. 
So the next time you hear a vegetarian or a kindred spirit 
order something funky at a restaurant, don’t ask “why.” That will make you sound dumb. Instead, try asking “what.” Be a little more curious and a little less judgmental. Vegheads around the world will thank you.

Trick or Treat? 
What’s in your chocolate?
Halloween is approaching, and although college 
kids are (hopefully) too old to make rounds in the neighbor -
hood asking for candy, you will probably gorge yourself on some kind of sweet treat this month. 
Maybe you’ll get your hands on a fun-size Snickers bar, 
some M&M’s or a Hershey’s Kiss. 
Chocolate — simple packaged goodness. Ingredients: Cocoa beans, cocoa butter, sugar and milk. Right? Wrong. Other than the concrete ingredients that go in your choco-
late, you may not think about the hours of labor that go into the planting, harvesting and distributing of these cocoa beans. 
Once you learn the truth about what’s in your chocolate, it 
may start to seem more like a trick than a treat. 
The Ivory Coast is the world’s largest cocoa producer, pro-
viding about 43 percent of the world’s cocoa. According to the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, there were about 284,000 children working on cocoa farms in hazardous conditions in 2002. U.S. cocoa manufactures such as Hershey’s have claimed that they are not responsible for the conditions on cocoa plantations because they do not own them. 
If children are working on cocoa farms, this means that 
their families live in dire poverty. These children are working instead of going to school. Because they cannot be educated, the cycle of poverty in their families will continue.
This is an unsustainable life-cycle, trapping cocoa harvest-ers at the bottom of the ranks. How-ever, this problem has been identified, and today there is an ongoing move-ment called “Fair Trade” to help solve it. 
A Fair Trade certification on chocolate helps to ensure the 
consumer that the cocoa in his or her chocolate has been har -
vested by an of-age farmer who is typically a member of a small farming collective. This farmer receives basic rights, liv-ing wages and fair working hours. This means his children are not working in the fields and that he earns enough to send them to school. 
Fair Trade-certified chocolate makes up only 1 percent of 
the $13 billion U.S. chocolate market. In addition to being the month of Halloween, October is also Fair Trade Month. This month, human rights organizations around the globe are pro-moting Fair Trade products to increase awareness of these hu-man rights issues and to promote businesses that do the right thing. 
As consumers in the First World, we need to realize that we 
can influence standard business practices. Our dollars support markets such as these, and we can use them wisely to vote for companies that practice human rights and sustainability. 
What can you do?As you may already know, certified Fair Trade chocolate is 
a tad bit more expensive than non-certified chocolate. 
I know we are college students. Most of us would rather 
drop big bucks on a snazzy Halloween costume this month than on pounds of slave-free chocolate. However, as I men-tioned earlier, you can vote with your dollar. This means you can choose when you buy Fair Trade.
In my apartment, we bake chocolate chip cookies every 
week and about half the time, we use Fair Trade semi-sweet chocolate chips. A bag of SunSpire Fair Trade Organic Choco-late Chips for baking runs about $5.50 in Ward’s Supermarket or Mother Earth. 
If you are craving a chocolate bar, Divine brand Fair Trade-
certified chocolate is also sold at Ward’s and Mother Earth. It runs about $4 a bar. My roommates really dig the white choco-late with strawberries flavor. 
Chocolate is not the only thing that can be Fair Trade-certi-
fied. Coffee and tea are also popular items that have the same human rights issues attached to them. 
I brew my own coffee in the morning and use Greenwise 
Publix organic, Fair Trade-certified coffee. This can be found in any Publix in Gainesville and runs at only $6 a bag. 
Look for the Fair Trade logo (a half-black, half-white per -
son outline holding a basket) on these products to ensure that they are Fair Trade. 
Each time you purchase a Fair Trade product, you are sup-
porting a business that does the right thing and a new blos-soming movement toward making ethical businesses practic-es a standard. When you have a chocolate treat, try to go the extra mile to purchase Fair Trade.

Speaking Out
This week, Saudi Arabia’s King Abdul-
lah granted women in his country the right to vote.
Whoop-dee-doo.We act like this is news. This is nothing. 
Women’s suffrage is not a novel concept. Most people, including yours truly, believe universal suffrage must be a staple in any truly democratic society.
For those of you who are unaware, Saudi 
Arabia is a monarchy in the Middle East. The United States depends heavily on it for oil, so naturally our diplomatic policy toward the country has been something along the lines of “to each his own.” And I do mean “his.”
Saudi Arabia is a feminist’s worst night-mare. Women aren’t allowed to drive or leave the house unaccompanied by a man. If they do, they can be lashed. It is an extreme-ly conservative and religion-centric society — like Mississippi, with a bit more sand.
For some reason, every time Saudi Arabia 
decides to grant its citizens a little more free-dom, the world rejoices. 
Yes, women now have the right to vote, 
but like I said earlier, they are not allowed to drive or be in public without a male es-cort. So if their husband doesn’t want to take them, they won’t be able to vote. Women’s suffrage is dependent on male accompani-ment. How is that a freedom?
All this shows is that King Abdullah and 
the Saudi Arabian establishment are scared.They are far from 
stupid. They see what’s been going on in Egypt, Libya, Syria and Bahrain. 
The Arab Spring could be the end of Saudi Arabia as we know it.
Having said that, the United States will 
never openly support a Saudi regime change — not unless we are sure the rebels would win. We learned our lesson in the 1970s af-ter aiding Israel despite a threat from Saudi Arabia to cut oil production that resulted in a gas crisis and recession. As long as Saudi Arabia’s rich, ruling aristocracy can remain in power and in control of the black gold, I can guarantee we won’t supply their rebels with weapons. 
King Abdullah and the Saudi elite are 
afraid of losing control. That’s why they have done everything they can to keep the masses happy and at bay. 
While this slight progression toward de-
mocracy in Saudi Arabia should be rejoiced, my advice is to remain skeptical. It’s not like King Abdullah watched just enough Life-time Channel to have a change of heart. He has ulterior motives.
Deterring the Arab Spring is the king’s 
top priority, and he will continue to provide his people with illusions of freedom in order to accomplish this goal.

Distinguished atmospheric scientist 
Katharine Hayhoe will visit UF to talk 
about a little more than the weather.
Hayhoe, a research associate professor 
of the geosciences department at Texas Tech University, will be speaking at a seminar co-hosted by the Florida Climate Institute and the UF Water Institute.
The seminar is scheduled for Thursday 
from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. in Emerson Alumni Hall Room 209.
“The purpose of the seminar is to ex-plore the reliability of various climate models,” said Carolyn Cox, coordinator for the Florida Climate Institute.
Making climate projections for cities is 
challenging, Cox said.
Climate models give a worldwide fore-
cast.
Hayhoe will take a look into climate 
projections by evaluating current models’ reliability and presenting a new approach to remove model uncertainty. 
She said she will reveal her new ap-
proach at the seminar.
Hayhoe is known for developing ways 
to measure the potential impacts of human activities at the regional scale, Cox said.
Hayhoe said climate change is one of 
the greatest challenges facing this genera-tion. 
“We [in Florida] are particularly vulner -
able to sea-level rise and climate change geographically,” Cox said.
Admission to the seminar is free and 
open to the public. The room holds about 100 people. 
A question-and-answer section is sched-
uled for after the seminar, where students will be able to talk to Hayhoe.
“A lot of people have doubts, and this 
will be a chance to clear them out,” said Wendy-Lin Bartels, post-doctoral research associate for the Florida Climate Institute.  
Hayhoe will also discuss climate sen-
sitivity and its implications on the projec-tions for Florida’s future climate.
“Climate affects everything around us,” 
Cox said. “There is a need in Florida for re-liable climate information.”Geoscientist will explore climate projections during seminar

Pumpkins aren’t naturally pink, 
but come Saturday , Oct. 15, about 
300 pumpkins will be.
At UF&Shands’ first Pink Pump-
kin Painting Party , people can paint pumpkins pink to help raise breast cancer awareness.
Painting will take place on the 
Cancer Genetics Research Com-plex lawn on the corner of Gale Lemerand Drive and Archer Road. The event is free for attendees. The cancer center’s communication and marketing fund is paying for the $2,000 event, according to Lindy Brounley, the communications di-rector for the UF Shands cancer center.
Brounley said she wants the 
message behind the pink pumpkins to touch everyone when attend-ees display the pink pumpkins on their doorsteps. Brounley also said the pumpkin party would allow Gainesville residents to interact with the hospital’s staff in a differ -
ent kind of setting.
“We don’t often get to see them 
in a setting outside of the hospital, so this would give us the oppor -
tunity to interact with them doing something fun,” she said.
Typically , the pink flamingo is 
the symbol for breast cancer aware-ness, but the team at the cancer cen-ter thought it was a little outdated.
Instead, they opted for pumpkin 
painting — something they felt was fun and family-oriented but  would still help raise awareness for their cause.
“We’re trying to achieve an in-
creased awareness of breast can-cer … so that people can live,” she said.Pink pumpkins to raise 
breast cancer awareness“Climate affects everything around

Alligator File Photo
Lauren Embree and the defending NCAA champion Florida women’s tennis 
team opens its season today in Paciﬁ  c Palisades, Calif.
  MEGAN WALSH
 Alligator Writer
 
  When the women’s tennis 
team returned to campus in May 
as national champions, Gator Nation celebrated the team’s ac-complishments.
  But in the four weeks since 
fall practice began, not much has been said about the team taking college tennis’ biggest trophy just ﬁ  ve months ago.
  “Honestly, we haven’t really 
talked much about last year as far as the championship is con-cerned,” coach Roland Thorn-qvist said Monday. “What we try to do is reinforce that we perhaps won a championship because we did so many things that we try to do every day, and we did them with the right atti-tude.”
  Expectations are high from 
the start as ﬁ  ve Gators begin play today in the Riviera/ITA All-American Championships in Paciﬁ  c Palisades, Calif., the ﬁ  rst leg of the collegiate Grand Slam.
  With every player from last 
season’s roster returning for another championship run, this year’s preparation should be no different. But that doesn’t mean Florida is content with relying on its skill set from a season ago.
  “Now I really feel like the 
whole team has turned the page,” Thornqvist said. 
“We’re proud of what we did 
last year, but I think all eight of our players on the roster look toward this year and have their own motivation to do great things again.”
  Although Thornqvist point-
ed to a drop in intensity in the past few days of practice after a month of the same routine, he said he has already noticed major improvements in players like sophomore Olivia Janowicz, who is ranked No. 37 in the pre-season ITA rankings. 
  “Boy, is she a different per-
son, different player this ﬁ  rst month of the year, and hopeful-ly that’s going to show up down the road,” Thornqvist said. “She looks more conﬁ  dent and more sturdy on the court.”
  He also has big hopes for Al-
lie Will, who spent her summer playing against players ranked in the top 130 in the world while competing in two tournaments on the pro circuit.
  “She’s seen big balls,” Thorn-
qvist said. “She’s seen balls from some of the greatest hitters and biggest hitters in the world the past couple of weeks, so she’s going to be ready and she’s go-ing to be match-tough, and I’m certainly looking forward to see-ing how that translates to col-lege play.”
  Will and Lauren Embree, 
ranked No. 2 and No. 5, respec-tively, in the preseason rankings, will join their qualifying team-mates Thursday in the tourna-ment’s main draw after receiv-ing automatic bids.
  In the meantime, Florida will 
focus on getting back into the swing of match play and encour-aging team-wide improvement.
  “We’re trying to do the same 
thing as last year without do-ing the same thing as last year,” Thornqvist said. “It can get hard to be innovative, but after four weeks we’re still all on the same page.”

Florida will be without John 
Brantley when it travels to Baton 
Rouge, La., this weekend.
Coach Will Muschamp said 
Monday that Brantley will miss Saturday’s game with what Mus-champ classified as a “lower-leg injury” and that freshman Jeff Driskel is in line to start against No. 1 LSU.
“John’s disappointed,” Mus-
champ said. 
“He’s playing really well. … 
He’s disappointed. I’m hurting for him, but it’s time to pick up the other guy. That’s what our football team will do.”
Brantley left last week’s 38-10 
loss to No. 2 Alabama near the end of the first half after he was sacked by Courtney Upshaw. Brantley’s right leg bent under him, and he clutched his knee be-fore being helped off the field by trainers.
Muschamp would not com-
ment on the extent of Brantley’s injury, but multiple reports sur -
faced Sunday that it was a high ankle sprain.
Brantley could be out for an ex-
tended period of time, and Mus-champ said he will give weekly updates on Brantley’s status. He said the quarterback will not re-quire surgery.
With Brantley sidelined, Mus-
champ said Driskel is the team’s starter despite spraining his ankle against Alabama. 
Florida’s coach added that Ty-
ler Murphy and Jacoby Brissett will also take repetitions in prac-tice this week.
With the Gators having to rely 
on a freshman signal-caller in Death Valley, the team will ex-perience a dropoff in experience 
from Brantley, a senior with 18 starts under his belt.
If Driskel 
is indeed the starter come 
Saturday, it will mark the first of 
his career. 
He enrolled early at Florida in 
January as the No. 1 quarterback recruit in the nation out of Ovie-do Hagerty High, according to Rivals.com, and asserted himself as Florida’s backup early during fall camp.
“Jeff is a very mature young 
man,” Muschamp said. 
“He’s a guy who went through 
spring with us, and he’s a very outstanding athlete and an out-standing quarterback.Brantley out against LSU, freshman Driskel to start at QB

Florida coach Will Muschamp ad-
dressed his defense’s issues Monday 
following a 38-10 blowout loss at home in which the Gators failed to limit the Crimson Tide’s run game. 
In addition to missing tackles on 
running back Trent Richardson, Mus-champ said the Alabama offensive line confused the Florida defensive front by disguising and switching its blocking assignments. The Gators also were exposed multiple times on poor angles to the ball carrier.“Stopping the run, playing blocks 
up front, leveraging the ball and tackling better — that’s where it all started,” Muschamp said. “To me that was the story of the game, and we knew that going in.”
Richardson 
ran for a career-high 181 yards and two touch-
downs, wearing down the UF defense on 29 carries. Muschamp said players were trying to do too much against Alabama instead of taking care of their individual    matchup.Multiple issues at fault 
for lapse in run defenseBig men need love, too.
We hate on offensive linemen so 
much when they fail our teams. No run-
ning lanes? Blame the hogs. Sacks? Do your 
job, fatties. Holding calls? False starts? Fum-bled snaps? Big men, big men, big men.
They don’t receive enough praise — any 
football player will tell you that. So let’s not fall into such a trap. The big men did great last weekend. Alabama’s big men.
Saturday’s 38-10 loss was decided at the 
line of scrimmage. Florida couldn’t establish the run; Florida couldn’t stop the run. 
Answering all those master-padawan 
questions about Nick Saban last week, Will Muschamp made it clear that his former boss provided Muschamp with his blueprint for running a college football team. Among those instructions was a simple rule: Use a pro-style offense.
On Saturday, we 
attended a clinic revealing just how much Florida needs to grow to reach Muschamp’s in-
tended destination: Saban Status. The differ -
ence in the two programs? About 10 pounds — the discrepancy between Florida’s average starting offensive lineman (302.2 pounds) and Alabama’s bigger big men.
In the first quarter, the Crimson Tide ran. In 
the second quarter, they ran some more. After 
halftime, they kept it up, chipping away until Florida needs to beef up its 
beefcakes in pro-style system

After its worst performance of the season, 
the Gators’ defense knew it had to step up, and 
it did so in a big way this weekend.
Against then-No. 12 Tennessee on Sept. 
25, Florida allowed a season-high four goals. Following the 4-2 loss, the Gators addressed several areas of concern on defense, resulting in shutouts posted at home against Vanderbilt and Kentucky.
“To give up four goals in a game is not 
where we want to be by any stretch of the imagination,” coach Becky Burleigh said after the Tennessee game.
Two of the Volunteers’ goals came directly 
off Gators turnovers.  
Burleigh emphasized the importance of 
making sure they were on target whenever they played passes coming from the side and back passes, as miscues can lead to scoring op-portunities for the opposition.
The advice paid dividends for No. 12 Flor-
ida (10-3, 3-1 Southeastern Conference) as it played cleaner games in the weekend’s shut-out wins.
Last week in practice, the Gators made 
some tactical adjustments to help the defense. Their system often requires sending many players forward, including the outside backs.  If not handled correctly, that style of play can lead to mismatches when the other team goes on the attack.
Burleigh said Florida needed to focus on 
recognizing when it was sending players for-ward and taking the correct actions under those circumstances, whether it’s waiting for help-side defense to step up or keeping play-ers back.
The adjustments were evident, as the Gators 
held the Commodores to three total shots Fri-day night, while holding the Wildcats to just two shots on goal Sunday.
“After [the Tennessee game], we kind of 
focused this weekend on ‘get the shutout, get the shutout,’ and keeping that in the forefront really helped,” senior outside back Jazmyne Avant said Sunday.
The play of Avant and the rest of Florida’s 
back line was key in wins during the weekend.  Avant, sophomore Maggie Rodgers and junior Kat Williamson were on the pitch for the en-tirety of both games.
Freshman defender Annie Bobbitt played 
70 minutes Friday night af-
ter coming in for injured ju-nior defender Katie Kadera, and Bobbitt played 90 min-utes on Sunday.
Burleigh said that al-
though Bobbitt played due to the injury to Kadera, Bob-bitt has improved during the 
course of the season and earned more playing time with her performance in limited minutes.
“We’ve been working with her on her phys-
ical presence, which I think she’s made a big emphasis to get better at, but she [keeps her composure],” Burleigh said of Bobbitt. “She is calm on the ball and has excellent distribu-tion.”
The Gators’ strong defensive play also 
earned Williamson multiple honors, as she re-ceived her second SEC Defensive Player of the Week award this season.  She was also named to the Top Drawer Soccer National Team of the Week. TUESDAY, OCTOBER 4, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 15

Betsy Smith works hard — very hard.
And there has been nothing but good results for 
the efforts of No. 13 Florida’s junior middle blocker, who has played a bigger role on the court in 2011 than in the past.
“She’s a special person and player,” Wise said. 
“We knew it was going to take time and she just never quit mentally or emotionally.”
This year has featured a significant increase in 
playing time for Smith, who sat behind All-South-eastern Conference First Team selection Lauren Bledsoe and the conference’s reigning blocking lead-er, Cassandra Anderson.
Now she sees the court more often, and it is pay-
ing dividends for the Gators.
“Betsy may not be the best jumper in the league, or 
the fastest player, or the tallest middle in the league, but there are very few who have a higher volleyball IQ,” coach Mary Wise said. “I’d put her work ethic up against anybody.”
Smith has started 12 matches for Florida this sea-
son, posting a .407 hitting percentage, the second-best mark on the team.
Also, she is out-blocking Anderson and currently 
ranks third in the SEC with 1.13 blocks per set.
Her increased role and her consistent numbers 
are a result of a productive summer, Wise said.
“There are players that work hard in front of the 
coaches, but Betsy’s a player who works very hard when the coaches aren’t even around,” Wise said.
Florida’s sweep against Georgia had extra mean-ing for Smith, who was able to play in front of her sis-ter, a freshman student at UGA, and family less than two hours away from her hometown of Atlanta.
In her two previous trips to Athens, Ga., Smith 
only appeared in two sets, but she played all three Sunday.
“I thought back on the times [Smith’s family has 
come] in the past — now in her fourth year in the program — where if she got in (against Georgia), it was very limited play,” Wise said.
“Sometimes, she didn’t play at all. Although 
I didn’t have an opportunity to talk to her family, I talked to her high school coaches and they were pretty excited.”
Smith took advantage of the extra time on the 
court, hitting an errorless .700 for the match, record-ing a block, four block assists and seven kills.
Arguably Smith’s biggest play of the match came 
on the final play when she recorded a kill off a set by sophomore setter Chanel Brown to clinch the third and decisive frame. 
“The rally [Sunday] to end the match took a while 
and I think the story of that match continues to be Betsy Smith,” Wise said. “It was perfect that she would have the swing at match-point to win it.”
Jaeckel receives SEC honor: Redshirt senior 
outside hitter Kristy Jaeckel was named the SEC Offensive Player of the Week after her efforts in back-to-back 3-0 sweeps of Auburn and Georgia last weekend.
In those two matches, Jaeckel recorded a .455 hit-
ting percentage, 29 kills and 11 block assists.Smith playing larger role, providing 
production at middle blocker for UFthe Gators’ defense didn’t want any more, until the unit that ranks 
third in the Southeastern Conference against the run resorted to piggy-back rides and arm tackles.
Defensive end Sharrif Floyd said after the game that fatigue 
didn’t set in, but on-field evidence proved otherwise, as did the stats. 
Crimson Tide running back Trent Richardson gained a career-
high 181 yards on the ground; Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey com-bined for 8 yards on 14 carries. Alabama’s defense notched three sacks; Florida got zero. The Tide held on to the ball for 18:40 in the second half; the Gators picked up just two first downs after the break.
Not all of this can be chalked up to the big men. John Brantley’s 
leg injury changed the complexion of the game, kind of. He was playing the best game of his career, but even that was not enough. Even then, Florida was trailing 24-10. Even with 190 first-half pass-ing yards, Demps and Rainey gained 1 yard on eight carries.
Some will argue that Alabama’s hogs weren’t the difference, 
that Richardson and his grown-ass-man strength carried the Tide. But backup Eddie Lacy was just as effective, averaging 6.4 yards per carry.
So, how do Florida’s big men get some love? They have to get 
bigger.
Offensive coordinator Charlie Weis found himself in a similar 
situation when he took over at Notre Dame. After three seasons with offensive lines averaging 300 pounds or lighter, the Irish bulked up in 2008, when players recruited by Weis went through the team’s training program.
The Irish’s opening-day starting linemen averaged 315.4 
pounds — about 15 pounds heavier than the average lineman the year before.
Expect a similar jump in Gainesville as Muschamp and Weis 
try to create a Tuscaloosa-feel at the line of scrimmage. For now, though, the Gators face a steep battle.
LSU’s offensive line is even bigger than Alabama. And don’t 
forget Georgia. The Dawgs will bring the heaviest o-line in the na-tion to Jacksonville when they play the Gators on Oct. 29.
That line averages 329.4 pounds, and it will expect love. A 
whole lot of love.

Florida linebacker Jon Bostic (52) will not be suspended by coach Will Muschamp for throw-
ing a punch at Alabama offensive lineman D.J. Fluker during the second quarter Saturday.
Bostic will not be suspended for throwing punch during game
Muschamp took responsibility for 
the miscues, saying it all starts with 
coaching.
“We have to do a better job coach-
ing and playing,” he said. “This is a line of scrimmage game. … We were domi-nated up front on both lines of scrim-mage.”
Defensive tackle Jaye Howard said 
after the game he would come in on Sunday, a scheduled off day, to look at the film and learn from his mistakes. Howard had eight tackles against the Crimson Tide and was one of the few bright spots on the line, but Muschamp said the unit overall has plenty to be concerned about.
“Obviously the film doesn’t lie,” he 
said. “The film speaks for itself. The guys understand it. They see the film; they get it. They have to play better, and I’ve got to coach batter.”
With a game in Baton Rouge, La., 
against No. 1 LSU coming this Satur -
day, Florida’s coach expects the Gators to respond well to the challenge.
“We have a bunch of prideful guys 
in here,” Muschamp said. “Obviously, we didn’t play as well as we would have liked the other night, but I do be-lieve that we will respond well.”Bostic’s haymaker: Linebacker Jon 
Bostic’s personal-foul-inducing punch thrown at Alabama offensive lineman D.J. Fluker during the second quarter will not warrant a suspension, Mus-champ said Monday.
After a first-and-goal run, and well 
past the whistle, Bostic and Fluker continued to go at it. Bostic’s punch missed, and Muschamp pulled him from the game immediately.
“It’s not something we’re going to 
have at the University of Florida and Jon understands that,” Muschamp said. 
“He is a great football player and a 
great young man. There are times that we lose our composure and our poise a little bit, and we’ve got to be able to handle it.”
Etc: Other than quarterback John 
Brantley, cornerback Jeremy Brown is the only player ruled out for Saturday’s game against LSU. Brown continues to struggle with a sprained knee he sus-tained during training camp. … Safety De’Ante Saunders will return against LSU after missing the game against Al-abama due to a team-imposed suspen-sion. Muschamp would not clarify the team rule Saunders broke.

NoteBook , from page 14Driskel has seven completions, three turnovers in four games
“He’s got legs, he can run, he’s a guy who can give you 
some variety as far as escaping the pocket and evading 
the rush. I think that’s a positive.”
Driskel has seen time in four of the Gators’ five games 
this season, with Florida’s 33-23 win against Tennessee on Sept. 17 as the lone contest in which he wasn’t a par -
ticipant. 
In limited playing time, he is 7-of-16 passing for 73 yards and two interceptions and has run the ball 12 times for 26 yards.
He looked wide-eyed and uncomfortable in the sec-
ond half against Alabama’s stout de-fense, completing just 2 of 6 passes while overthrowing receivers and often looking to tuck the ball and 
scramble. 
After escaping the pocket in the third quarter, Driskel 
displayed his athleticism on a 31-yard run — the longest run allowed by the Tide all season — but he will have to make plays with his arm as well on Saturday.
While Muschamp said he thinks Driskel is past the ini-
tial shock of facing Southeastern Conference defenses, he said the rest of the team will have to step up, too.
“We got to play well around Jeff; we got to play around 
him and what he does,” Muschamp said. “Him having played before, been in the fire before, certainly that will help him on game day.”
