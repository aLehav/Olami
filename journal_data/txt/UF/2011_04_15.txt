store burglar got a surprise when they broke into his business to steal the pain medication Lortab — the pills had been replaced with beans.
Pharmacist Mac Clark works at Fred’s 
Drug Store in Pascagoula and told WLOX TV the store has broken into several times in the past six months, and each time the burglars got Lortab. He decided he needed a decoy.He put kidney beans in a large Lortab 
bottle. 
Around 6 a.m. Wednesday, the burglars 
came back. 
The only thing stolen was the Lortab bot-
tle filled with beans.
Investigators believe the burglar cut him 
or herself during the break-in because they found a trail of blood leading away from the building.

Local dog walker Bruce Baber walks his dog and his clients’ dogs (from left to right: Emma, Lucas, 
Argyle, Huckleberry and Abbey) in Northeast Park on Thursday afternoon. Baber’s dogsitting busi -
ness was shut down in February by the city after a neighbor complained that the dogs he watches made too much noise. Baber now walks dogs instead of caring for them in his home.

The cost of motorcycle and scooter decals will increase this fall 
because of a compromise made in 2008.
Rather than have a sharp increase in decal prices in the fall of 
2008, UF administration and staff from Transportation and Park-
ing Services spoke with some concerned students in a meeting that 
February and decided to raise the price over the 
span of a few years.
The cost of yearlong scooter decals will in-
crease by $48, bringing the total cost to $144. 
When students and faculty came to the table, 
they discussed a proposal to raise motorcycle and decal rates from $36 per year to $122 per year, the same as a yearlong student automobile 
at the time. Instead, the price of the decals was 
raised from $36 to $64.
“After reviewing the price and the rationale, the students and 
the administrators agreed that it was appropriate to increase the price to the same level as a student automobile decal, but not all in 
one jump,” said  Scott Fox, director of Transportation and Parking 
Services.
Fox said meeting attendees decided to increase the decal prices 
in three stages until the price was the same as a student automobile Compromise 
led to phased price increase

The Gainesville Police Department 
is calling on UF students to help them 
identify, catch and arrest a wanted man 
who robbed and raped a local woman Sunday.
Because the suspect and the victim 
are both of college age, and because the crime occurred so near the campus area, police have reason to believe students are their best chance of bringing the sus-pect to justice, said GPD spokeswoman 
Tscharna Senn.
On Sunday morn-
ing at about 4:30 a.m., a black man unknown to the victim knocked on the door of her home, located near campus 
on Southwest First Av-enue 
When the victim 
opened the door, the man threatened her with a knife and pushed her through the entrance.Police search for rapist

Keeping in line with popular demand, 
UF libraries will once again be offering ex-
tended hours during final exam season.
From April 17 to April 28, Library West 
and Marston Science Library will be open 
from 8 a.m. to 4 a.m. The Starbucks on the 
first floor of Library West will have the same hours as the library . 
Barbara Hood, public information officer 
for the UF libraries, said UF has been imple-menting the change during fall and spring final exams for the past few years. Although it is still technically a pilot project, she does 
not anticipate it changing in the near future. 
“As long as students keep coming [to] those extended hours, the hours will con-tinue,” Hood said. 
Library associate Chris McHale esti-
mated that thousands of students are in the 
library each day during finals, and he does not anticipate a decrease in numbers. 
A recent policy change now allows stu-
dents to reserve Library West study rooms 
days in advance. 
McHale said students have 
been able to book study rooms up to two weeks in advance 
since late March. The rooms were previ-ously lent to students on a first-come, first-served basis.

and reserving a study room, visit the UF li-braries page at uflib.ufl.edu. Campus libraries stay

n HIS BUSINESS WAS SHUT 
DOWN IN FEBRUARY.
By MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Writer 
As Bruce Baber walks four dogs 
down University Avenue, he listens 
to “This American Life” and tries 
not to think about his own.
He walks with the dog leashes 
in one hand and a red “Save Bruce” 
lawn sign in the other. The logo is also printed on his white shirt, a remnant of a neighborhood move-ment to save Baber’s dog-sitting business.
Since the Gainesville City Com-
mission ruled in February that he was not allowed to run his dog-sitting business from his home, he’s 
been trying to make ends meet by 
walking the dogs he used to watch all day . 
He gets $5 per dog for an hour-
and-a-half walk, which he does a few times a day . However, it doesn’t meet his day-to-day needs.
“There’s not a lot of dogs to be 
walked,” he said.He made $12 per dog, per day 
when he cared for them at his house. He made a very small profit back then. Now, he can’t break even.
“The dipping into the savings is 
kind of scary ,” said Baber, 64. “I was planning on having that cushion.”
His life changed that February . 
No more dogs to care for. No more 
smiling faces charging at him when 
he opened the door. No more guard dogs to protect him from strangers and loneliness.
“It was extremely much too quiet 
and lonely at night,” he said.
But he said it’s getting better.Now, he gets into his Mazda 5 
minivan and drives house-to-house 
through neighborhoods collecting 
his customers’ dogs. He goes down-town with his canine companions panting out of every window to un-load them for their walk. 
Sometimes, he’ll lead them to a 
dog park where they’ll sprint and dig and play to their hearts’ content.
“The dogs are getting a far less 
quality experience because they could’ve played with each other all day,” Baber said.
When he walks them, they line up side by side like sled dogs. They look back at him every so often with wide eyes and panting mouths as 
if to check that he’s still there. They 
look like they’re smiling.
He’s always been introverted 
and doesn’t like talking with people much, he said as Sadie, a fluffy gol-dendoodle, leaned her head on his leg.
“I just love dogs in general,” he 
said. “I just have a rapport with 
them.”
While they run around at a dog 
park on Main 
Street, a black dog, Abbey , stops and looks 
at Baber. He waves to her.
He said she’s his favorite right 
now, but, then again, she belongs 
to him. Baber adopted Abbey last 
week after being her foster father for 
four months.
She keeps him company at home 
and on his 15-mile weekend walks when he clears his mind of the stress 
that plagues him on a daily basis.
“Any anxiety I might have,” he 
said, “I get to walk off.”
He likes most of his neighbors, but there is one family he tries not 
to think about. Getting angry won’t solve anything.
The Gainesville Board of Adjust-
ments initially approved his request for an exception to city code so he could keep his dog-sitting business. 
Then, the neighborhood family 
— the Bowes — complained that the 
dogs were too loud.
They won, and Baber was out of 
business.
“I’m past the point of being an-
gry ,” Baber said. “I still have some 
resentment ... I try not to think about that now.”
Tuesday , he heard the best news 
he’s heard in a while. The Gainesville 
Community Development Commit-
tee is considering changing a city code to allow pet businesses. There would be restrictions on how many animals could be kept at once and the types of animals that could be kept for pay.
“It’s never going to be a real busi-
ness situation,” Baber said. “It will 
be a making-ends-meet situation.”
But it would give him back the 
business he started in 1987, which 
he’s said is his life.He said he’s optimistic that the 
commission will change the code.
Commissioner Thomas Hawk-
ins, who is chairman of the commit-tee, said it would take at least six months. It could take longer.
He said he supports the code 
changes Baber’s attorney suggested, but some members of the committee 
aren’t behind the changes just yet.
At the last meeting in March, the 
committee decided to ask for some 
changes before they look at the pro-posal later this month.
Unlike with the February appeal, 
Hawkins said the Bowe family’s complaints probably will not be tak-en into account since they haven’t 
come to any of the the committee 
meetings.
The Bowe family could not be 
reached for comment.
Besides, Hawkins said, the rest of 
the neighborhood seems to believe that Baber is a neighborhood gem, not a nuisance.
Baber said after everything he’s 
been through, he’s happy things might take an upward turn.
“It’s been a real roller-coaster 
ride,” he said.

IN HIGH SCHOOL.

To simply take a walk with Sean 
Rozycki is impossible. Instead of going 
for a casual stroll, you’re more likely to 
take a series of disjointed strides  punc-
tured with many starts and stops.
That’s because every half city block 
or so, he’ll crouch unannounced or 
freeze and twist his body to get that 
perfect shot that most people would 
pass by, unnoticed.
“You’ll never find someone more 
passionate about photography,” he 
said.
Locals may know the 24-year-old 
as the pierced and tattooed metalhead 
behind the bar of Mars Pub and Laser Tag. If they don’t recognize him from that, they may know him as the orga-
nizer of the Silver Q pool league. 
It’s likely they’ve also noticed him 
with his Nikon D90.
His love for photography goes back 
to childhood. His mother was a shutter -
bug and being around her planted the 
seeds for a budding interest in every-
thing to do with cameras.
Growing up in Stuart, Fla., Rozycki 
attended Martin County High School, 
which offered an intensive photogra-
phy program.
He signed right up.But that first semester, he was more 
interested in working on his skate-boarding technique, for which he was 
starting to gain some real recognition 
around town — until his teacher took 
him aside and said he had a talent that shouldn’t be wasted.
After that, he said he got 100s on ev-
ery assignment. 
 “I slowly realized my style and pas-
sion,” he said.
He graduated and moved to 
Gainesville in 2006, trying to escape the 
heartbreak of a marriage engagement 
broken by infidelity. Photography took 
a backseat to skating and living life. 
He almost got a sponsorship and 
went pro, but a lack of resources sent that opportunity south. After a series of 
bad luck and tough times, he fell into 
a depression and started drinking — a 
lot.
He floated through life without di-
rection until, fed up with his situation, 
he focused on quitting his bad habits 
and saved money to buy a Nikon D40.
Behind the lens, he remembered 
why he loved photography in the first 
place.These days, Rozycki can be found 
walking the streets of downtown, cam-
era in hand, collecting shots, which can 
be seen at seanrozycki.blogspot.com, and working toward his goal of becom-ing a photo novelist. 
“People pass by everyday things 
and don’t appreciate them and I’m not yelling at them for it,” he said, “I’m photographing it so they have a chance to see it.”4, ALLIGATOR n FRIDAY, APRIL 15, 2011

Skater views life through a lens

For most UF students, a typical Friday evening of-
fers a golden opportunity to unwind from the wear 
and tear of the week.
For Jennie Costa, the start of a weekend means driv-
ing 20 miles to Alachua, reading English to Spanish-
speakers and playing soccer with Mexican children.
And she wouldn’t have it any other way.
The UF health science sophomore volunteers for 
Proyecto Libros de Familia, or Project Family Books, a 
program funded by the Office of Migrant Education. 
The program helps migrant families succeed and ad-
just to frequent moves by providing tutors for their 
children and placing volunteers with families to work 
with every week. 
Costa and two friends have been volunteering ev-
ery Friday since October, she said, except for holidays. She said they are lucky to have been placed with their 
family because they’ve formed a close bond.
 “I love it,” she said. “I look for -
ward to it every week.”
Once they arrive, they read with the kids for an 
hour.  They’ll read books she brings, such as “Oh! The 
Places You’ll Go” and “The Giving Tree.”
The parents moved to the United States from 
Mexico, and the mom cannot read English. The dad is working on pronunciation, she said, and the stu-
dents have been tutoring the parents as well as the 
children.
Victoria Gomez de la Torre, a teacher specialist 
for Proyecto, which has been around for more than 
30 years, said the children of migrants tend to fall be-hind academically due to their families’ need to move 
frequently.
Although hesitant toward education at first, the 
children, de la Torre said, make radical changes. Some  
even consider going to college.
In the end, she said, they believe in themselves and 
see possibilities for their lives.
“When we can address their specific needs, it is 
then that we can start really making a difference,”  de 
la Torre said.Program helps

He then ordered her to strip and forced her to 
have sex with him. 
He left the house on foot. The man is described as a college-aged black 
man about 5 feet 10 inches tall with a slim build with short, cropped hair. 
He was last seen wearing a black T-shirt, 
denim jeans and M&M boxer shorts.

Gainesville Police have canvassed the vic-
tim’s neighborhood as well as notified univer -
sity authorities who have taken it upon them-selves to distribute a flier among the Student Body describing the suspect and the crime.
Beyond the hope that students may help 
catch the rapist, police would like to remind students to be aware of their surroundings and the dangers of answering their doors for strangers.
“He appears to be a stranger which we don’t 
see hardly in Gainesville … parents have been calling from all over the place,” Senn said.
“We want to make sure [students] are being 
very careful who they open their doors to and not to walk alone at night.”FRIDAY, APRIL 15, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 5

decal. 
The second increase came in 2009, 
when yearlong decals went up to 
$96. This year’s increase is the third 
and final increase.
Ata Sarajedini, current chair of the 
Parking and Transportation Com-
mittee, said the committee, which 
is made up of students and faculty, 
occasionally goes out of its way to 
seek additional input if a special is-
sue comes up.
He said people sometimes forget 
that the department doesn’t get uni-
versity funding, so it has to make its 
own revenue, and sometimes that 
means raising decal prices.
“It has to be self-sustaining,” he 
said.
Fox said his department heavily 
encouraged students to use motor -cycles and scooters years ago.
But after surveying drivers, he 
said about 80 percent used vehicles instead of buses. On top of that, about 
80 percent of motorcycle and scooter drivers surveyed said they took six 
or more trips a day around campus 
because parking was so available.
“You compare that to what some-
one in a car does,” he said. “They 
tend to drive on cam-
pus, find their spot and 
stay put all day long.”
He said the rationale 
was that motorcycles and scooters 
were more environmentally friendly than cars, but since drivers took more 
trips, they actually burned more gas 
than students who drove cars. 
Also, the department didn’t want 
to encourage students to drive mo-
torcycles and scooters instead of tak-
ing the bus.The price of yearlong scooter 
decals will increase by $48

Abortion stance key to conservatism
“I am fiscally conservative but socially liberal.”
How many times am I going to have to hear 
that? 
We are in an era of increasing awareness of the impor -
tance of fiscal responsibility, coupled with a moral decline 
that has led to personal responsibility being hardly an after -
thought. So it  is certainly no surprise that this has become a 
very sexy and chic political philosophy.
It essentially boils down to this: “I am for lower taxes 
and smarter spending and all that, but don’t get me caught up in that abortion stuff.”
The problem is that so-called social issues cannot be 
divorced from true conservatism. This philosophy, often called neoconservatism, results in little more than a speed 
bump in the path of the progressive movement toward its 
ultimate goals of statism and tyranny.
Conservatism, boiled down to its most basic form, pro-
motes a stable government that allows equal opportunity and justice for all members of society while staying within its bounds. Any true conservative will thus be appalled about excessive taxation, deficit spending, intrusive agen-cies and overbearing regulation.
For the same reasons, any true conservative will also be 
appalled by abortion.
In 1973, the Supreme Court legalized abortion on de-
mand. In so doing, the branch of our government charged with enforcing the justice of our laws executed the most far -
cical miscarriage of justice in the history of our nation. Mil-lions of lives were on the line — lives that were protected under every system of law in the history of Western civili-zation. Abortion had been treated as first-degree murder in every courtroom and legislative body for countless genera-
tions, and a single vote in a court of law overturned centu-
ries’ worth of legal precedent.
While there was no legal precedent for abortion, there 
actually was precedent for the general ruling, which stated that unborn babies “are not persons” and therefore are not subject to legal protection as human beings. Similar rulings were made in Nazi Germany, the USSR and else-where. Radical liberals never have a problem with stripping humanity 
away from a certain demographic of 
the population based on ethnicity, physical or mental handicap, reli-gion or natal status in order to allow mistreatment or extermination on a 
large scale for political gain.
Why do conservatives feel the need to accept this trag-
edy? Because liberals were, as usual, given the opportunity to frame the argument. 
By first convincing the American people that it was a 
moral issue (even though it had been a legal issue for centu-ries), then forcing the argument that the government cannot legislate morality (even though it always does), many have been shamed out of speaking up for the unborn.
It is not difficult to see that this issue touches on both 
aforementioned aspects of conservatism — responsible government and human rights. The Supreme Court wrong-fully decided that an arbitrary “right to choose” trumped 
the right to life, which was listed first among the unalien-
able rights in our own Declaration of Independence. Incon-venience was made a capital offense, the ultimate price for which has been paid by millions of voiceless Americans while those who have a voice are shamed to silence by those who gain from this genocide.
If our government has the power to change the defini-
tion of a human being, do we really think we can stop it from raising our taxes? 
If real change is to be effected in Washington, a whole-
sale transformation must occur in how our elected officials perceive life — yours, mine and that of the unborn.

Darts & Laurels
We aren’t the only ones who need to make time for im-
portant things.
Several restaurants on the UF campus garnered some 
minor complaints from the Alachua County Health De-partment, which leads us to think they need to take a mo-ment to clean up their eateries. 
With so many students chained to these food vendors 
via meal plans or time constraints, we expect to not have mentions of “rodents, roaches, flies and other vermin” on the inspection reports. 
While we understand the violations are minor, we’re 
still throwing a we’re-at-your-mercy-here DART at Ara-
mark.
We’d like to hope these infractions won’t happen. It’s that same futile hope that caused us problems at the 
Orange and Blue Debut on Saturday.
We can’t say it was much of a letdown, but having a 
new football coach with a new method in charge ignited, if nothing else, some curiosity. When The Swamp shows more love toward three statues than toward the living, breathing team on the field, we’ve got a problem. For 
setting us up for disappointment, we’re airing out a this-
is-football’s-version-of-the-disappointment-Obama-sup-porters-felt DART at blind optimism. 
We guess we signed up for this when we donned our 
orange and blue.
But enough with the bad. We received some good news 
this week, even if it took the form of remorse.
A Quinnipiac poll shows that our favorite supervillian 
look-alike, Rick Scott, is losing supporters. It was bound 
to happen as he slashed the state budget while funneling 
more funds to the workers closest to him. 
Oh, and that whole getting back to work thing isn’t 
panning out like he thought either. For coming to their 
senses nearly half a year too late, we’re giving a better-
late-than-never LAUREL to Florida voters. We’re not as 
stupid as we thought.
With this loss of support, we’re hoping Scott will be 
merely a four-year historical footnote for our state.
The same should go for the immigration law Arizona 
passed last April, not to mention the bill in our own state legislature. 
The immigration challenge needs an answer that 
doesn’t leave our state open to legalized discrimination in the form of racial profiling, but that solution is not yet on the table.
 For moving such legislation ahead, we’re throwing 
a “reasonable-suspicion”-sounds-pretty-unreasonable DART at the Florida House. The decision by a committee 
to pass the bill along isn’t only morally wrong but also economically stupid.
On that note, we hope everything is sunshine and rain-
bows for you this weekend, Gators. Relish these last few hours of free time.

Reader rejects abortion
As a woman, I seem to be continually hearing that 
I need to make my voice heard in regard to abortion. 
So here it is.If it wasn’t for my mom deciding against abortion, I wouldn’t have written this. My mom was a junior in college when she got pregnant out of wedlock. 
Her family was very conservative, and she attended a 
Christian college. Mom could have aborted me and moved on with her life. Instead, she chose to keep me. She dropped out of college and got a full-time job. My great-grandparents looked after me while she worked. I asked Mom once why she didn’t choose abortion. She told me that she hadn’t had to think about it much; life is sacred even if it’s unexpected. Because of that, my voice will be raised in a resounding “no.” No to abor -
tion, no to running from the consequences of sex, no to ending a life before it even draws a breath. Mom was scared of being a mother, but she accepted the respon-sibility of raising me. 
Ladies, if you want control over your body, don’t 
have sex. That’s really the only choice you get.

Veganism easier than ever
In response to your April 13 article “Downtown Cupcake Shop Serves Vegan-Friendly Fare,” I would like to thank Brittany Brave for highlighting some of 
the many delicious reasons to choose vegan sweets in 
Gainesville.  V egans have a mere fraction of the rate of heart disease, strokes, obesity and cancer that meat-eaters have, and they don’t support one of the most ecologically destructive and cruelest industries on Earth: animal agriculture.
Most people are horrified to discover that ani-
mals raised and killed for food are treated in ways that would warrant felony cruelty-to-an-
imals charges if cats or dogs were the victims.  
Chickens often have their beaks cut off without any 
painkillers, and cows and pigs are skinned and dismem-bered, often while still conscious. This kind of abuse is standard in an industry that refuses to make even the most basic changes in the way that animals are treated.  
Fortunately, as many UF students have already discovered, there are so many delicious vegan options available these days — including bar -
becue veggie riblets and vegan pizza — that  
it’s easier than ever to give meat the boot for good. 
For more information, visit peta2.com and request 
a free vegan/vegetarian starter kit.

peta2.comLetters to the Editor
Relegated primarily to elementary school playgrounds, taunt-
ing, name-calling, and insult-lobbing have made their way 
into the houses of Congress, according to a study released by 
Stanford and Harvard professors.
Justin R. Grimmer of Stanford University and Gary King of 
Harvard University found that 27 percent of congressional press releases that their team analyzed consisted of “partisan taunts.”
The study started by analyzing press releases from Sen. Frank R. 
Lautenberg, a Democrat from New Jersey who famously called Re-
publicans “chicken hawks” in a floor speech in the Senate.
After also analyzing a State of the Union 
address from President Bush and a series of Reuters articles, the team took 64,033 press 
releases from 2005 to 2007 to estimate the presence of taunting.
From those releases, Grimmer and King found that 27 percent of 
releases are taunts, and that taunting increases when a senator faces less competition in his or her state.
 King hopes to be able to determine whether Democrats or Re-
publicans are responsible for the majority of political put-downs and whether taunts tend to be employed by particular congress-men over others.
“The whole point of democracy is to represent, and if they want 
to do so by taunting each other, they will keep doing just that,” King said.

up the top seed in the American La-crosse Conference Tournament in front of a season-high crowd of 1,518, and she was dead set on sprinting down to the south goal to celebrate with the goalie who made it possible.
As the final buzzer rang, Cullen was 
quickly joined by her teammates in a mass of screams, outstretched arms and flying lacrosse sticks.
“It’s just indescribable. Last year 
we were down 14-0 at half and now we just beat them,” said Cullen, who scored a game-high six goals. “It just shows how much we’ve matured in the last year.”
The end result was a stark turn-
around from the position the Gators (13-1, 4-0 ALC) were in against the Wildcats (12-1, 2-1 ALC) only 3:34 be-forehand.
Down two players for the game’s fi-
nal minutes due to yellow cards, goalie Mikey Meagher had every right to 
crumble down the stretch. She was out-
gunned defensively, her team had once 
again been dominated draw control 
(17-9), and the Gators’ back line was giving up free-position shot opportuni-ties on nearly every NU possession. 
“I feel like my team played fantas-
tic, the defense as well,” said Meagher, who had 10 saves on the night. “They never really put me in a bad position, 
and they held their own. Mistakes are 
going to happen, and then that’s when I have to be there to clean them up.”
With two saves in the last 30 sec-
onds, including one off a free-position shot, the sophomore held Northwest-ern’s offense, including NCAA points leader Shannon Smith, who scored her final goal with 6:37 left in the game.
That’s when Cullen scored one of her NCAA-best 67 goals to close the game for Florida.
With 5:35 left, Cullen beat a Wild-
cats defender outside the left 12-meter arc with a stop-and-go move. Her ac-celeration was so sudden it caught the rest of the defense off guard. The lone Northwestern player left between Cul-
len and the goal slipped, leaving goalie

On the heels of its worst result of 
the season in the Hootie at Bulls Bay 
Invitational, one would expect the Florida men’s golf team to be con-cerned about its play this weekend.
But, in fact, the opposite is true. Speaking to the media this week, 
the No. 5 Gators exhibited a cool confidence heading into the postsea-son at the Southeastern Conference Championship in St. Simons Island, Ga. 
“I’m not concerned with our re-sult in Charleston,” UF coach Bud-
dy Alexander said. “We haven’t finished 
lower than third with 
our three best players in the lineup.”
Florida did not 
have a full comple-
ment in Charleston because fifth-year senior Andres Echavarria was in California playing a Nationwide tour event, in which he placed sec-ond.
Perhaps more than anyone else 
on the team, senior Bank V ongvanij exuded confidence that his team will rebound from its struggles in the fi-nal regular-season event. 
“We just need to keep doing 
what we’ve been doing all year,” said V ongvanij, the sixth-ranked golfer in the nation. “We’ve had a couple weeks to work on things, so we’ll be fine.”

The Gators have wasted no time flexing their 
imaginations in the days leading up to this week-
end’s NCAA Championships. 
As its biggest competition has creeped closer, 
finally kicking off with the semifinals in Cleve-land tonight, the team has worked to imitate the 
meet’s setting on its home turf. 
This weekend will round out the season, as 
the top three teams in each of tonight’s two semi-
final sessions will advance to the NCAA Super 
Six on Saturday to vie for the national title.
After failing to perform under pressure at the 
NCAA North Central Regional competition earlier this month, 
the Gators have been using a 
heavy dose of intrasquad scrim-
mages to create pressure situa-tions and perfect their blemish-
es in the practice studio. 
“A mistake would happen, 
and the nerves kind of got higher and higher and higher,” 
senior Maranda Smith said of the team’s lacklus-ter regional performances.  
The fifth-seeded Gators hope to avoid any 
surprises this weekend after emulating the meet’s 
setting down to its finest details.
UF formed a team corral during the in-
trasquads, which is where the gymnasts are 
separated from the performer, prompting them 
to amp up their own energy and support the 
competing gymnast.
“We’ve been trying to scream as loud as we 
can,” Smith said. “We’ve been trying to put pres-sure on them and make it like an exact meet set-
ting.”

Loss snaps Wildcats’ 38-game ALC win streak
country’s leader in goals.
“The best defenders I go against 
are the people I go against every day, 
whether they’re the girls who are on the field or subbing in the game,” Cul-len said. “I owe everything to them because of the way they push me in practice.”
The goal ended a 3-0 Wildcats run 
after two free position shots and an unassisted goal by Smith.
Florida was outscored in the sec-ond half for the fourth time in five games. After UF took a 9-4 lead into 
the break, North-western outscored the Gators 7-4 over 
the final 30 minutes, attempting to pre-serve its 38-game winning streak in regular-season ALC play.
“What I’m most 
proud about this team is that we made some bad passes and bad deci-sions down the stretch with our shots, but I heard three people say, ‘Don’t 
worry about it; I’ve got your back,’” 
UF coach Amanda O’Leary said.
While O’Leary doesn’t like to see 
the trend develop on her young team, it’s a pattern that has yet to hurt the Gators.
“This is the best [team] I’ve ever 
coached, top to bottom,” O’Leary said. “I’ve had some great players at Yale and had some great teams at 
Yale but this … is the most talented 
group I’ve ever worked with.”

Women’s field loaded with seven top-25 teams
six ranked squads.
The Florida women will try to bring home an SEC crown 
against a field that is arguably stronger than the men’s com-
petition. The No. 21 Gators will tee off against seven top-25 schools this weekend in Auburn, Ala.
The women enter the SEC Championship in much better 
form than the men, as their final round at the Liz Murphy Invitational was dubbed by head coach Jan Dowling as “by far (the team’s) best performance of the year.”In that round, the Gators shot up the leaderboard from 
12th place to fifth with a tournament-record score of 5-under 
par. 
The most consistent performer for Florida 
has been sophomore Mia Piccio, who has fin-ished in the top 20 as an individual in all four of the team’s events this spring. 
Dowling called the short game the team’s 
biggest weakness, and it has been the top pri-
ority in most practices this year. 
“I think that’s what has helped us improve late in the sea-
son,” junior Evan Jensen said.GOLF , from page 14prepping them just as she does during competitions. 
The assistant coaches took on the role of the meet’s 
judges.
As the intrasquad competitions have racked up, 
freshman Mackenzie Caquatto said, the once-lacking 
confidence is starting to shine through once again.
“We can definitely see a lot more confidence in 
their faces,” Caquatto said. “They’re not as timid. They’re not holding back.” 
Caquatto is part of the crew that makes up what 
Faehn calls her “heavy hitters.” Faehn said it would 
be especially important that Caquatto, Alaina John-
son, Ashanée Dickerson, Marissa King and Smith are 
all in top form this weekend. 
“Those are the ones that have come up, typically, 
with the big scores for us,” Faehn said. “What we’re 
asking is that they go out and stay focused on the 
present moment and not get ahead of themselves.
“We’re going to lay it all out on the line,” Faehn 
said. “However it finishes, it finishes. But we’re not 
going to leave there with any regrets.”Faehn hopes ‘heavy 
hitters’ will deliver

Prior to the start of the 2011 sea-
son, senior Josh Adams expressed 
relief and optimism about the op-portunity for a fresh start. 
Coming off a miserable junior 
campaign, UF’s second baseman said, “It’s a new year. New things can happen. I had a bad junior year, but I can’t dwell on it. Now, I’ve got to move forward.”
Thirty-four games into the sea-
son, No. 4 Florida’s senior steward has put his words into action. 
After a career-worst junior cam-
paign, which came on the heels of first-team All-Southeastern Confer -
ence accolades in his first two years 
at UF, Adams’ pop has returned. 
A year removed from barely 
eclipsing the Mendoza line (.206) in 
SEC play , the slick-fielding infielder leads the Gators in batting average (.362) and is second in multi-hit and multi-RBI games. 
“It’s what I envisioned after last 
year,” Adams said. “I’m where I 
want to be.”
UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan praised Adams’ efforts, saying, “I’m 
awfully proud of the way he has 
battled through 
that adversity and put together 
a really solid start 
this year.”
The second 
baseman attrib-uted his struggles in 2010 to mental gaffes but said he 
has been much more patient at the plate this season.
“Last year, I was swinging at a 
lot of balls outside the zone,” Ad-ams said. “This year, I’m sticking with my approach and taking it at-bat by at-bat.”
O’Sullivan also said Adams’ abil-
ity to punish pitchers for their mis-
takes has become noticeably better.
“When he gets his pitches, he’s 
not missing them,” O’Sullivan said. 
“Last year, I thought he missed a bunch of pitches he could hit. This year, he’s doing the exact opposite.”
Adams added that his improve-
ment was a product of batting low-er in the order — something that 
changed again last weekend.
When Florida (26-8, 9-3 SEC) 
takes on Georgia (18-16, 8-4 SEC) 
tonight at 7 in Athens, Adams will be slotted in the two-hole, but the second baseman said his rebound this year is a result of getting better pitches to hit because of the players placed around him. 
“I’m pretty much thanking them 
every day,” Adams said. “It’s defi-nitely helped me out.”
After batting Adams seventh 
or lower 22 times this season, O’Sullivan shuffled the lineup again last weekend at Mississippi State, sliding Adams back into his cus-tomary two-hole, where he began 
the season.
“I’ve just got to keep working at 
it and hopefully keep the numbers 
up,” Adams said.

UF ROUNDUP

While Aja Paculba, Kelsey Bruder and Me-
gan Bush often receive national attention for their gaudy numbers, the group has one per -
son to credit for its success: leadoff hitter Mi-chelle Moultrie. 
When she is not laying down textbook 
bunts or swiping bases, the dynamic junior is chasing down fly balls most players wouldn’t have a chance at. 
Despite her reserved personality, her value 
speaks for itself. 
“I’ve been coaching softball for 13 years, 
and this is my second time to have a player of her importance to a team,” UF coach Tim Wal-
ton said. “She might hit a home run. She might 
drop a bunt. You get too close, she might hit 
you.”
Moultrie’s versatility has been key to UF’s 
success this season. She leads the team in bat-ting average (.466), on-base percentage (.548) and stolen bases (19) and is tied with Bruder 
for the team lead in runs scored (48). 
“I don’t know what we’d do without her in 
center field,” Paculba said. “She saves a lot of 
runs and a lot of extra-base hits.” Moultrie will need to set the tone tonight 
at 7 as No. 10 Florida (34-7, 10-6 Southeast-ern Conference) faces a tough road matchup 
against No. 24 Auburn (32-9, 11-6 SEC). 
The Tigers may not have the Gators’ of-
fensive firepower, but they do have one of the 
best rotations in the country . 
While UF’s pitching staff carries an impres-
sive 2.05 earned run average, Auburn’s three-deep rotation holds an even better 1.85 mark. 
After leaning on freshman Hannah Rog-
ers for more than a month, the Gators could be getting a boost against the Tigers as senior Stephanie Brombacher looks to return from a bicep injury . 
Walton said she could have pitched 
Wednesday against FIU if UF had jumped out to a bigger lead, but he didn’t want to put her in a high-pressure situation. 
“Yesterday she threw hard, and today she 
threw harder, so it was good to see that and get a positive message back from her,” Walton 
said after Wednesday’s 8-0 win. “Today was 
the first day she really wanted to get out there and pitch.”
TRACK AND FIELD TO HOST DEFENDING CHAM-
PION TEXAS A&M: Pressly Stadium will be full of national champions this weekend.
Joining the back-to-back NCAA indoor 
champion Florida men’s team will be defend-ing champion Texas A&M, which brings its 
No. 2 men’s squad and No. 1 women’s team 
for the Tom Jones Memorial Classic, begin-ning at noon Saturday.
“For them to come down here is big because 
we don’t normally get to see them until cham-pionship time,” senior Terrell Wilks said. “To 
have them come to our home track is going to 
be fun. It’ll be a very competitive meet.”
The Aggies swept the NCAA Outdoor 
Championships last season, taking home the 
men’s and women’s titles.
UF scored 40 points, finishing a distant 
third on the women’s side, but the competition between the men’s teams was much closer.
The Aggies edged the Gators 55-54, hand-
ing UF its second consecutive second-place 
finish at the NCAA Outdoor Championships.
“They’re the reigning national champions, 
and we’ve got to dethrone them. So, keeping 
that in mind, we just put our best foot forward 
and run with it,” junior Christian Taylor said. 
“There’s definitely a revenge factor, espe-cially when it’s come down to just one or two points.”
This weekend’s meeting will mark the first 
time the two have met since the NCAA In-door Championships in March, when Florida won the event with 52 points and Texas A&M 
placed second with 40.
However, as UF coach Mike Holloway has 
maintained throughout the year, the No. 1 
men’s team is focused on its own results and continually improving its marks.
“Anytime you put Florida and Texas 
A&M on the same track, there’s going to be an 
adrenaline rush. But we’re going to focus on 
Florida,” Holloway said. “We would like to run well this weekend, but I’d like to run very well at the conference and national meets, where it counts.”
