After a six-year absence, an 
American-style circus will be back 
in Gainesville for a two-day per-formance.
Cole Bros. Circus Of The Stars 
will perform in The Oaks Mall parking lot at 4:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. today and Tuesday.
Chris Connors, performance 
director and ringmaster, said the circus is the world’s largest and America’s oldest big top circus. This year, the show will feature 20 acts by about 40 performers.
“The circus opens up with a roar 
and ends with a bang,” he said.
Bill Carter, marketing director 
of the circus, said the event will include several signature shows, including a human cannonball fea-turing the world’s largest cannon.
The show will also include new 
acts from a Colombian high-wire troupe as well as up-close perfor-mances by baby elephants and white tigers.
“It is a much more intimate ex-
perience than seeing a circus in an arena,” Carter said.
Cole Bros. Circus Of The Stars 
travels up and down the United States’ East Coast for nine months every year. It is currently in its 129th season of touring.
Discounted tickets can be pur-
chased online at www.gotothecir-cus.com or at regular price at the box office in front of the tent. Free children’s tickets are available at various restaurants around town.
The show works and performs 
seven days a week, usually in three different towns a week, Carter said. After Tuesday’s final performance, the circus will continue its tour in Brunswick, Ga.

A UF student faces felony charges after 
turning herself in last week for a hit-and-run 
accident in 2011 that killed two Sanford, Fla., motorcyclists.
The Florida Highway Patrol charged Rita 
Laurie Carter, 20, of DeLand, with two counts of leaving the scene of a fatal crash and two counts of driving under the influence man-slaughter, among other charges, according to an FHP news release.
Carter is currently a UF student studying 
telecommunication, according to her Facebook page.
The crash happened at about 4:20 a.m. Oct. 
16, 2011, after Carter, driving her 2007 Ford Explorer westbound on Interstate 4 near State Road 44, hit the back of a motorcycle driven by Javier Remonsanzol, then 34.
The force threw Remonsanzol and his pas-
senger, Allison Sellers, then 32, from the bike, according to an FHP crash report.Remonsanzol was thrown into the road, 
and Sellers landed on the highway shoulder. Neither of them were wearing helmets. Mul-tiple cars hit Remonsanzol while he lay in the road, including a Chevrolet Impala that struck a tree and caught fire trying to avoid him, ac-cording to the report.
Paramedics pronounced Remonsanzol and 
Sellers dead at the scene.
Meanwhile, Carter, who was 19 at the time 
of the crash, pulled off the interstate and drove UF student turns herself in for 2011 crash

Dave McDaid was living in 
New York during Sept. 11. A few 
days after, he left because of the uncertainty of what could happen next.
About nine years later, the 
37-year-old founded the IRISH-WATERDOGS WARRIORS pro-gram, a nonprofit organization serving veterans, first respond-ers and their families by doing outdoor activities one day each month. These activities include kayaking, fishing and sailing.
The organization is in the pro-
cess of opening a store that would sell apparel and outdoor equip-ment in downtown Gainesville. The money from the shop will help support the High Springs chapter, McDaid said.
“The things I get to enjoy, and 
the things I love in the country, I have them because of our veter-ans,” he said.
The High Springs chapter had 
its kickoff event Friday at the San-ta Fe Canoe Outpost, 21410 U.S. Highway 441. 
A group of veterans and vol-
unteers went kayaking for three hours down the Santa Fe River.
Alee Karpf, who has been 
working with the program for about a year, said kayaking is an activity disabled veterans can par-ticipate in because it depends on upper-body strength.
“The veterans get to feel com-
pletely at ease,” she said. “It’s a chance to shake off all that stuff.”
Adam Haddock, a 39-year-old 
Air Force veteran, knows first-hand how drug abuse and depres-sion can affect other veterans.
Haddock was a first-time par-
ticipant in the program and said kayaking is a good way to release tension in a positive way.
“It’s like a natural antidepres-
sant,” he said.

KATHRYN VARN
Alligator Staff WriterFor Donald Shepherd Sr., running for local office doesn’t 
require a thick wallet. He believes the best way to represent 
ordinary Gainesville citizens is to be one.
Shepherd, 59, will be running for mayor in Tuesday’s 
Gainesville city elections on a platform of representing low-income groups, improving city infrastructure and fighting homelessness.
“People are first with me,” he said. “When I become may-
or, I’m going to address the people’s problems.”
If elected, Shepherd said one of his first priorities is to work 
toward permanently fixing the city’s homelessness problem. He said he would speak one-on-one with homeless people to find out exactly what they need to better themselves.
“I want to find a more permanent solution,” he said.Shepherd has lived in Gainesville since 1997 and worked 
as a groundskeeper for UF’s Physical Plant Division until 2011. While he worked for the university, Shepherd said he contributed design plans for the Hilton University of Florida Conference Center Gainesville on Southwest 34th Street as well as the UF sign on the corner of West University Avenue and Southwest 13th Street.
Shepherd’s experience motivated him to focus his plans 
on improving city buildings and infrastructure. One of his initiatives includes revamping Bo Diddley Community Pla-za to be a cleaner, more efficient gathering space.
Shepherd said he also wants to bring more tourism to the 
city by building an amusement park somewhere along U.S. Route 441, he said.
To pay for these improvements, Shepherd said he will 
make sure money from the city’s budget is being allocated efficiently.
Nancy Shepherd, Shepherd’s wife and campaign man-
ager, said she believes her husband understands what needs to be changed in Gainesville, especially for its low-income citizens.
“He would make a great mayor because you would call 
him anytime, and he would answer the phone and talk to you,” she said. “I think he would serve Gainesville very well.”

Animal rights activists set up a video station on 
Turlington Plaza to show video of researchers con-ducting experiments on monkeys. The tape showed researchers removing the amygdalas of conscious monkeys’ brains while the monkeys clung to the doctors. PETA’s Florida spokeswoman Holly Jens-en said the group showed the video to protest fur-ther research like one proposed UF research project to study the monkeys’ behavior when brain dam-aged.
March 19, 1999Two Penthouse Magazine models visited 
Gainesville for that year’s 30th annual Mac Tools Gatornationals drag race. Melissa Ann and Andi Sue Irwin had been recognized as “Pet of the Month” and “Pet of the Year” respectively. The magazine used to send its models to every National Hot Rod Association event. Signed pictures of Ann and Irwin were given away to anyone who bought a new copy of Penthouse at the event.
March 20, 2007The Hub fully reopened after three years of 
renovations. It became the new home to the sec-ond Starbucks on campus, the UF Computing Help Desk and the International Center.

broke down, said FHP spokeswoman Sgt. Kim Montes.
A police officer on his way to the crash recog-
nized Carter’s car and detained her. 
However, officials didn’t have enough evidence 
to charge Carter in connection with the accident, Montes said.
“Any time you have a hit and run, it’s a very 
labor-intensive, long, procedural process to prove who the driver is,” she said.Carter’s blood alcohol content was reported to 
be .043 three and a half hours after the crash. Using her reported blood alcohol content level, investiga-tors mathematically predicted Carter’s blood alco-hol content level at the time of the crash to be .095, which is over the .08 legal limit, Montes said.
After a year-and-a-half-long investigation, FHP 
connected Carter to the accident and issued a war-rant for her arrest March 11, Montes said. Carter turned herself in at the FHP DeLand station later that day.
Montes could not provide further details on the 
investigation.

With clenched fists stretched 
in front of him, 8-year-old Kyle 
Molina gripped an invisible steer-ing wheel. 
He grinned when the roar of 
two cars jetting down the track shook the bleachers.
“I was pretending I was driv-
ing the car,” he said.
Kyle was one of about 100,000 
people who flocked to Auto-Plus Raceway at Gainesville to watch the 44th Annual NHRA Gator-nationals, an annual drag racing competition held Thursday to Sunday.
During top fuel qualifying 
rounds Saturday, pairs of 25-foot-long cars zoomed down the straight track at speeds topping 300 mph.
Brittany Force, 26, was one of 
the drivers.
Force, who is in her first pro-
fessional season, said she grew up watching her father compete in drag races. She said she has fond memories of Gainesville races.
“The one thing I always re-
member about Gainesville are the fans,” she said. “They always have so much energy, and they’re so nice. No matter what happens, whether you win or you lose, they’re always there supporting you.”
Brandon Bernstein, a driver 
who made it to the second elimi-nation round, said he enjoyed going to compete in Gainesville because of the energy and night-life connected to the nearby uni-versity.
“It’s fun,” he said. “It has a re-
ally good feel.”
Nate Cross, Auto-Plus Race-
way sales and marketing man-ager, said the weekend weather helped bring out a lot of people to the event this year.
“A lot of people wait to buy 
their tickets until the last minute for this event,” he said. “We’re notorious for getting rain.”

City Commission seat in 2012.

Editor’s note: This is the final part 
of a series that profiles candidates running in the 2013 mayoral race. 
KELCEE GRIFFIS

Mark Venzke has led a colorful 
life.
The Chicago native used to work 
as a conductor and tour guide on an 
antique railway near Orlando.
He was also a Gainesville 
cabdriver who conducted informal quiz shows with passengers, giving chocolate as prizes for correct answers.
He ran, unsuccessfully, for 
Gainesville city commissioner last year. 
But with the campaign experience 
under his belt, Venzke said he’s ready to take it to the next level.
He’s running for mayor in 
Tuesday’s Gainesville city elections.
Venzke, 55, said his No. 1 issue 
is revamping the city’s proposed biomass plant contract to allow more resources for integrating renewable energy.
“We’ve put all of our eggs in 
one basket — a biomass basket,” he said. 
“We don’t have any eggs left over 
that GRU — the City of Gainesville — can use to promote and to facilitate the installation of renewable energy systems. But we could do that if we renegotiate this contract.”
Venzke also criticized the 
city for information he said was withheld from the public during the negotiation stages of the contract. 
He said citizens didn’t have a 
chance to discuss the contract with officials until a lawsuit settlement prescribed workshops.
“That’s wrong,” he said. “Our city 
leaders, and I, as mayor, would call workshops as often as we needed …to get a thorough airing of issues so that we can formulate good public policy based on good information.”
Making public records more accessible is another item Venzke said he would tackle if elected. 
Under the city’s current model, he 
said, residents must often navigate a maze of agencies and red tape to find documents they’re looking for.
“It’s a rather Byzantine process,” 
he said. “Often, people don’t get the information they need because they have to work through the system.”
Venzke said he would look into 
deinstitutionalizing the process and using more efficient technology.
Reed Franklin, a 65-year-old 
combustion turbine technician at the Cogeneration Plant located on the UF campus has been friends with Venzke for about 10 years.
He said Venzke brings a 
personable dimension to politics.
“I have a lot of respect for him,” 
Franklin said. “He’s very smart and very kind and caring — and honest. He’s not a politician. He’s just into making things better.”

Don’t let the media
feel sad for rapists
This editorial might make your skin crawl, and it should.
Court decisions were reached in the Steubenville, 
Ohio, case: “Two members of Steubenville’s celebrated 
high school football team were found guilty Sunday of raping 
a drunken 16-year-old girl, and Ohio’s attorney general warned the case isn’t over, saying he is investigating whether coaches, parents and other students broke the law, too,” The Associated Press reported.
“The crime, which took place after a party last summer, 
shocked many in Steubenville because of the seeming callous-ness with which other students took out their cellphones to record the attack and gossiped about it online,” continued the report. “In fact, the case came to light via a barrage of morning-after text messages, social media posts and online photos and video.”
It happened in August. Trent Mays, 17, and Ma’Lik Rich-
mond, 16, were sentenced Sunday to at least a year in juvenile prison. The details of the case, if you haven’t heard about it so far, are shocking. High schoolers took advantage of a young girl who was too intoxicated to consent to anything. The victim said, according to the AP report, she “believed she was assaulted when she later read text messages among friends and saw a photo of herself naked, along with a video that made fun of her and the alleged attack.”
“They treated her like a toy,” said prosecutor Marianne 
Hemmeter. All of the details make us feel extremely sorry for the victim. No one should have to go through that sort of violent situation. Could you imagine someone in the national media even slightly defending the accusers? CNN did.
“What’s the lasting effect, though, on two young men being 
found guilty in juvenile court of rape, essentially?” CNN anchor Candy Crowley asked on a Sunday morning broadcast. She wanted to know what this verdict meant because “a 16 year old, sobbing in court, regardless of what big football players they are, they still sound like 16 year olds.”
“There’s always that moment of just — lives are destroyed,” 
CNN legal contributor Paul Callan replied. “But in terms of what happens now, the most severe thing with these young men is being labeled as registered sex offenders. That label is now placed on them by Ohio law. That will haunt them for the rest of their lives.” Are we supposed to be concerned for the futures of young men who were found guilty of rape? Crowley wasn’t the only CNN reporter to express that sort of emotion or concern. CNN reporter Poppy Harlow said it was “incredibly difﬁ  cult” to watch “as these two young men — who had such promis-ing futures, star football players, very good students — literally watched as they believed their life fell apart.”
We’re not sorry if their lives are ruined. We don’t care how 
much they sobbed or broke down in court. They made an amaz-ingly horrible mistake, and they got caught.
“You were your own accuser, through the social media that 
you chose to publish your criminal conduct on,” the victim’s mother said. She added that the case “does not deﬁ  ne who my daughter is. She will persevere, grow and move on.”
Music helps us forget the annoying stuff
Whenever I get stressed, I turn to music.
“So what?” you say. “Everybody does 
that.”
Listen, if you don’t quit interrupting me, this is gonna 
take a lot longer than it has to. I turn to music because 
sometimes I’m listening to a song, and it’s just so spot-on to what I’m going through at the moment that I’m taken aback. I ask myself, did I write that and then time travel to the past to sell it to Jerry Garcia? 
So then, I waste a bunch of time researching time travel 
(read: setting all the clocks in my house back 20 minutes), and I’m not stressed anymore!
I turn to music because it’s the purest form of human 
emotional expression. It is our best way to evoke the in-nate structural beauty of the universe. And that’s not just some hippie s--- that I’m spouting off with no basis in fact.
Music and mathematics are entwined rather deeply, 
and mathematics is the most basic method we, as human-ity, possess to understand our universe.
I’ve heard before, from some of the folks I used to tu-
tor in math, things like, “Math is all made up. It’s not real. Math is stupid. My arm hurts; when can I stop turning this generator?” (That last one is what my roommate just said to me. Our electricity isn’t really out, but don’t tell him that.)
And it’s true, there are things you learn in math that 
seem to have no equivalent in the real world. I remember in seventh grade, when I ﬁ  rst learned the formula for the volume of a sphere.
“This is stupid,” I thought. “This is just totally made 
up. How did they get such a weird formula?” Then I got to Calc 3 and triple integrals and spherical coordinates. My teacher innocuously gave us an example problem in-tegrating a spherical area of radius r.
When we got to the very ﬁ  nal step of the problem, 
I dropped my pencil and stared at the paper in amaze-ment. I had just unwittingly derived for myself the formula that had ﬁ  lled me with middle school angst such a long time ago. I shouted for joy. 
Everyone in the class gave 
me a weird look because my shouts for joy last thirty minutes and consist mostly of unortho-
dox combinations of expletives.
Music is just as orderly and just as connected to the  in-
ner workings of the universe. Tons of people way smarter than I (e.g., Kepler, Pythagoras, Grover from “Sesame Street”) have done lifetimes worth of research on the way music is mathematically codiﬁ  ed by natural frequency.
Man didn’t invent music: He discovered it.Take scales. No caveman just sat down and invented 
the hypophrygian or mixolydian modes.
“Oog. Me invent music.”“Cool, Scott. I worked on the past tense and adverbial 
phrases all day.”
The notes we use in all of our various scales are sepa-
rated by frequency in such a systematic way that it seems like they have to be man-made. Then, you look at acous-tic waves and how they mimic the sinusoidal waves you used to graph in high school trig. Then, you hear someone play the goje, a traditional Hausa instrument developed with little or no inﬂ  uence from Western musicology.
Music, like math, is just something we humans do. We 
don’t have to try. Music happens to us.
I say all that to say: When it’s 4 a.m. and your neighbor 
has been blasting music too loudly through the walls for the past three hours, don’t call the cops. 
They’re probably just doing math!

Keep Lowe, keep jobs
As mayor, Craig Lowe has fought 
to bring innovative companies into 
Gainesville, and his efforts have paid off. 
Gainesville has seen the creation of 
more than 1,800 jobs since Craig has be-come mayor. Companies like Prioria Robotics and MindTree have been estab-lished in Innovation Square, bringing hundreds of jobs and making Gainesville a more appealing place to live for college graduates. As a college student, I can see myself living and working in Gainesville in a few years. 
I would encourage my fellow students 
to vote to re-elect Mayor Craig Lowe this Tuesday.
Joe Andreoli
UF geography juniorLowe’s vision to move Gainesville forward
As a citizen of Gainesville, I am proud Craig 
Lowe is our mayor. His skin may still be thick-ening, but his leadership, vision and compas-sion for our community are spot-on. I suspect with his re-election we will see a resurgence of vocal support at commission meetings for the vision he and countless others before him have honed to balance the well-amplified con-cerns of those few regular dissenters. I ask those fellow citizens of Gainesville who share the mayor’s vision of a forward-driven com-munity that respects our resources, protects our vulnerable citizens, and is mindful of our current and future energy, safety, fiscal and transportation needs to raise their voices and re-elect Mayor Craig Lowe!

Letters to the Editor
Gator Nation,
My name is Alfredo Espinosa, and I am a UF stu-
dent running for the Gainesville City Commission. The 
election will take place Tuesday.
I’m running for the District 4 seat, which encompasses our 
beloved UF campus area and the Duckpond neighborhood. 
The student population makes up an overwhelming majority of the District 4’s constituents, and that means us.
As a 20-year old student, I am fully aware of your situations, 
desires and hopes. I came to UF three years ago seeking friends and challenges and, more importantly, wanting to develop into a man of character. These past three years have given me expe-riences I will never forget, ranging from serving our university as a Preview staffer to working alongside our many organiza-tions to give back to the Gainesville community.I’d like to tell you all why I’m asking you to vote Tuesday.I’m running to give UF a seat at the table and to give stu-
dents the voice we deserve. We are important members of the Gainesville community, and unfortunately, there is no one cur-rently in office to protect our interests. Living in Gainesville for the past three years has instilled a sense of pride for my newly found home. I’m proud to say I’m not just a candidate in the local city elections — I’m one of you. We are the residents who live and breathe UF and came to love this city.
My goals are specifically tailored to suit the needs of UF stu-
dents and citizens of Gainesville.
Today, I want to promise I will work to push the closing of 
bars from 2 a.m. to 3 a.m. This move is designed to benefit the students who enjoy the Gainesville nightlife as well as helping the small businesses that thrive within our city. Gainesville is known for its small businesses and culture, and I want both parties to benefit from one another.
Together, we can do this. My 
passion for public service comes 
from seeing how we can improve our surroundings, and I want to do what’s best for all. I encourage you to familiarize yourselves with the candidates and vote Tuesday for the City of Gainesville.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at 
Alfredo@alfredoespinosa.com.
Go out to vote, and as always, go Gators!

  Senior guard Kenny Boynton (1) takes it to the basket during Florida’s 66-63 loss to Ole Miss in the SEC Tournament ﬁ  nal on Sunday at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tenn. 
  LANDON WATNICK
 Alligator Writer
   
 After falling 66-63 to Ole Miss on Sunday in the South-
eastern Conference Tournament ﬁ  nal, Florida will travel to 
Austin, Texas, for the NCAA Tournament. 
  UF earned a No. 3 seed in the South Region and will play 
a second-round game against No. 14 seed Northwestern State, the Southland Conference Tournament champions, on Friday in Frank Erwin Center. 
  If Florida advances, it will face either No. 6 seed UCLA 
or No. 11 seed Minnesota on Sunday for a spot in the Sweet 16. 
  Louisville, Indiana, Gonzaga and Kansas earned the four 
No. 1 seeds. The Jayhawks, No. 2 seed Georgetown and No. 4 seed Michigan share third-seeded Florida’s region. 
  Missouri (No. 9 seed) and Ole Miss (No. 12 seed) were 
the only other teams from the SEC to make the Big Dance. 
  A win Sunday against the Rebels (26-8, 12-6 SEC) could 
have helped the Gators’ case for a No. 2 seed.
  UF (26-7, 14-4 SEC) had two opportunities late to tie the 
score. After guard Mike Rosario’s layup cut the Rebels’ lead to two with 36 seconds left, point guard Scottie Wilbekin stripped the ball from Ole Miss guard Marshall Henderson in the full-court press and forward Casey Prather landed on it. 
  Following a timeout called by coach Billy Donovan, Ro-
sario found Erik Murphy on the block.
But the senior forward’s hook shot clanked off the right 
side of the rim. 
  With 8.6 seconds left, Florida fouled Ole Miss forward 
Murphy Holloway, who made his ﬁ  rst free throw but couldn’t convert on the second.
Following Murphy’s rebound, Wilbekin was fouled with 
4.2 seconds remaining before he could launch a three-point attempt. 
  In a double-bonus situation, Wilbekin missed his ﬁ  rst 
free throw and intentionally missed his second. Center Patric Young then successfully tipped the ball out to guard Kenny Boynton on the right wing. 
  But Boynton’s contested, off-balance three rimmed out 
as Henderson and Ole Miss celebrated midcourt. 
  “I tried to run towards the ball and get the ball before 
Ole Miss got it,” Boynton said.
“I kind of rushed it, because I was trying to back up 
and make sure it was a three-point shot before the time ran out.” Gators lose SEC tourney title, earn No. 3 seed
  JOSH JURNOVOY
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 The Gators are still waiting for 
everything to come together.
  It looked like it was ﬁ  nally hap-
pening as they took a 3-0 lead into the sixth inning of Saturday’s 11-5 loss to Kentucky after winning the series opener 4-1 on Friday.
  But that lead evaporated quickly, 
and Florida (9-12, 1-2 Southeastern Conference) never led on Sunday as it lost 6-2 in the rubber match against No. 10 Kentucky (16-3, 2-1 SEC).
  “I don’t think we’ve played a 
complete game yet as a team,” left ﬁ  elder Justin Shafer said.
“That’s what we play for every 
day, so it’ll be great whenever we get that.”
  Freshman Eric Hanhold strug-
gled on Sunday after the Gators re-ceived consecutive strong outings from their starting pitchers to begin the weekend.
Hanhold  
lasted only 3.2 innings while giving up ﬁ  ve 
runs and 10 hits and striking out three batters. 
  Kentucky took the lead for good 
during the second inning when Hanhold walked designated hitter Jeff Boehm on four pitches with one out.
After left ﬁ  elder Kyle Barrett 
reached base on an inﬁ  eld hit, catch-er Micheal Thomas took Hanhold deep to right for his ﬁ  rst home run of the season, giving the Wildcats a 3-0 lead.
  No Florida starting pitcher has 
lasted six innings in a win this sea-son.
Junior hurler Jonathon Crawford 
is the only UF starter to have a six-inning outing this year, and on the three occasions in which he did, he received a total of four runs of sup-port.
  Wildcats starter Corey Littrell 
gave up 10 hits, but scattered them UF drops

END OF GREGULATION
  With Sunday’s announcement of the NCAA Tournament ﬁ  eld, bracket season is ﬁ  nally upon us. 
Here are a few tips to help you win your pool.
  - The most common read of the NCAA 
Tournament is that the ﬁ  eld is “wide open.”
  While there is no clear No. 1 team, there 
is a deﬁ  nite drop off after about the four-seed line. Don’t get too crazy. 
  - No. 1 seeds are 112-0 in the ﬁ  rst round, and there’s no rea-son to predict that streak to end. Not all of those teams will make the Fi-nal Four — we’ll have more on that tomorrow — but a ﬁ  rst round upset 
doesn’t appear to be in the cards, especially this year. 
  - Resist the urge to pick a No. 15 seed to pull a ﬁ  rst-round upset. Although two No. 15 seeds won their ﬁ  rst game last year, only six teams have done it since the ﬁ  eld expanded to 64 in 1985. 
  No. 14 seeds are 16-96, while No. 13 
seeds are 24-88. Still, it’s worth noting that six 13 seeds have reached the round of 32 in the past ﬁ  ve years. 
  The upset pick du jour has been the 12-5, 
as those teams are 20-28 in the ﬁ  rst round during the past 12 years.

Sophomore right fielder Connor Mitchell (13) swings during Florida’s 11-5 loss to Kentucky 
on Saturday at McKethan Stadium. Mitchell scored one of Florida’s five runs after stealing third base in the second inning.
O’Sullivan seeking progress
as he allowed just one run and struck 
out seven in eight innings of work.
“He was mixing it up,” said Shafer, 
who finished the game 3 for 5 at the plate.
“He was throwing four pitches for 
strikes, and when a pitcher does that, it can make it tough.”
The Gators squandered an op-
portunity against Littrell in the third inning as right fielder Connor Mitch-ell got picked off at first with Casey Turgeon at bat after leading off with a single.
Turgeon then singled to left and 
two batters later was thrown out at third to end the inning on a Shafer single to right.
“Part of it was my fault,” Mitchell 
said of Florida’s offensive struggles against Kentucky. 
“That could’ve been a big inning.”Coach Kevin O’Sullivan specifical-ly mentioned another blown chance the Gators had two innings later. 
Mitchell singled to lead off the 
fifth. Turgeon then let a 3-0 count run full and grounded into a 4-6-3 double play.
Harrison Bader, Shafer and Vickash 
Ramjit followed with back-to-back-to-back singles to give Florida its first run of the game.
“If we have a different result with 
Casey’s at-bat there, who knows what happens in that inning,” O’Sullivan said.
Though the Gators have not had 
many easy wins, O’Sullivan said he is not worried about how they get them. He just wants progress.
“Look at all the phases,” O’Sullivan 
said.
“I don’t really look at it that way. 
I’m just looking for us to keep getting better day in and day out.”
Contact Josh Jurnovoy at jjurnovoy@
alligator.org.BASeBALL , from page 13Rebels opened second half on 26-8 run
Added Donovan: “Patric made a great effort to keep it 
alive on the second miss. Kenny didn’t have a great look, 
but at least we had a shot up there to try to tie it.”
Florida led 38-26 at halftime after shooting 7 of 14 from 
behind the arc, but Ole Miss opened the first 8:45 of the second half on a 26-8 run. 
“As a team we didn’t respond early in the first four min-
utes,” Rosario said.
“We gave the momentum, and I felt that they took that 
momentum in a positive way and just gave their team a lot of energy in the second half.”
Florida eventually worked its way back into the game 
but couldn’t succeed from the charity stripe. The Gators missed six free throws in the final 5 minutes as Young went 1 of 4 from the free-throw line. 
Each of Florida’s three seniors had a dominant perfor-
mance during the weekend.
In UF’s 80-58 victory against LSU on Friday in the quar-
terfinals, Murphy recorded a career-best 27 points on 11-of-15 shooting and 12 rebounds. 
Boynton scored 16 points in the second half against Ala-
bama to rally to a 61-51 semifinal victory on Saturday. In Florida’s loss Sunday, Rosario scored a team-high 18 points and grabbed nine rebounds. 
Holloway scored 23 points on 11-of-14 shooting Sunday, 
while Henderson notched 21 points. 
The SEC Tournament win is Ole Miss’ first since 1981. 
The Gators have not won an SEC Tournament title since 2007.
Heading into the Big Dance, the Gators are 0-6 this year 
in games decided by six points or fewer and 25-1 in games decided by 11 points or more.  
“The people trying to create this drama like our guys 
have lost confidence,” Donovan said. “Our guys haven’t lost confidence at all. They dug themselves a hole with our lack of defense.”
Said Rosario: “The best thing about this next tourna-
ment that’s coming up, NCAA Tournament, is the fact that as a team, we’ve been in every tight situation possible this year. That’s the beauty of it, because now we know what to expect.”“Our guys haven’t lost confidence at all. They 
dug themselves a hole with our lack of defense.”

On Wednesday, we’ll have a breakdown of 
some potential upsets. 
- Don’t worry about teams that lack depth. With 
longer TV timeouts, rotations typically tighten in 
the postseason. 
- Just because a team isn’t on ESPN doesn’t mean 
it isn’t a threat. The Atlantic 10 and Mountain West put five teams in the dance, and KenPom ranks the MWC as the No. 3 conference in the NCAA. 
Here’s a quick bit on each: 
No. 3 New Mexico: The Lobos play great defense and have good players 1-5, but they’ve won 15 games by single digits. Their 29-5 record could eas-ily be worse. No. 8 Colorado State: One of the best rebounding teams in a long time, the Rams are an experienced, physical group. No. 5 UNLV: Easily one of the most talented teams in the country, the Runnin’ Rebels have four play-ers with NBA potential. But without a true point guard, they struggle to get in a flow on offense. No. 7 San Diego State: Jamaal Franklin is a one-man show. He leads the Aztecs in points, rebounds, assists, steals and highlight-reel dunks. No 13 Boise State: The Broncos rely on the dynam-ic but inconsistent guard duo of Derrick Marks and Anthony Drmic. No. 4 St. Louis: A trendy Final Four pick, the Bil-likens have the guards to match up with anyone on the perimeter. No. 5 VCU: One word: havoc. The Rams lead the NCAA in forced turnovers and turnover margin, which allow them to get out and score in transi-tion. No. 6 Butler: The Bulldogs are tough, and coach Brad Stevens always has his team ready to play in March. No. 13 La Salle: The Explorers play four guards with regularity, making them a difficult matchup. No. 9 Temple: When Khalif Wyatt’s shot is on, the Owls are really, really dangerous.

The Favorite: Indiana
The team that started the season No. 
1 heads into the tournament as the third 
No. 1 seed.
Indiana is the nation’s most efficient 
offensive team and has proven capable of playing well at any pace. Led by play-er of the year candidates Cody Zeller and Victor Oladipo, the Hoosiers are among the most talented squads in the nation. 
The emergence of freshman point 
guard Yogi Ferrell gives Indiana an explosive, defensive presence to spell sharpshooter Jordan Hulls.
In many instances, the Hoosiers go as 
Christian Watford goes. A senior power forward, Watford has NBA talent and shoots 49.1% from three, but he doesn’t always show up. The Hoosiers will need him to play his best if they intend to make a Final Four run. 
Top Challenger: Miami
Under second-year coach Jim Lar-
ranaga, Miami won both the Atlantic 
Coast Conference regular season and tournament championships.
The Hurricanes are tough, physi-
cal and experienced — their primary seven rotation players are an average of 22 years old. Durand Scott and Reg-gie Johnson both missed time early this season, but the Hurricanes went on an 14-game winning streak when the duo returned to the court in January.Shane Larkin leads Miami with elite 
play on both ends of the floor in his first season as the starting point guard. Scott has shown the ability to be a dynamic scorer, while Florida transfer Kenny Kadji has been stellar as a defending, re-bounding stretch four.
The wildcard for the Hurricanes is 
the center position. Johnson is a talented but inconsistent 292-pounder who hasn’t scored more than five points since Feb. 19. He played just 3 minutes against North Carolina on Sunday. His strug-gles have led to more minutes for Julian Gamble, who can run the floor, rebound and protect the basket. 
Storyline to Watch: Will top talents 
shine? 
No. 5 seed UNLV and No. 8 seed N.C. 
State entered the 2012-13 season with great expectations, and neither came close to living up to them.
UNLV never found a floor general, 
as Anthony Marshall struggled in the transition from shooting guard to the point. N.C. State continues to be plagued by C.J. Leslie’s inconsistency. With four legitimate NBA talents each, either team could make a run.
Player to Watch: Brandon Paul, Illinois 
guard
Paul’s play will determine just how 
far the Illini go. One of the most athletic guards in the NCAA, Paul leads Illinois with 16.6 points per game. When Paul is at his best, Illinois can beat anyone.Earlier this season, Paul scored 35 
points on 10-of-16 shooting and 10-of-11 from the free-throw line as Illinois went into Spokane and handed No. 1 seed Gonzaga one of its two losses. He’ll face a test right out of the gate, matching up with 6-foot-6 sophomore Spencer Din-widdie, Colorado’s lead guard and star player. 
Sleepers: Bucknell
Star center Mike Muscala (19 points 
per game, 11.2 rebounds per game, 2.4 
blocks per game) makes the Bison a le-gitimate threat. Going against Butler, Bucknell won’t face the type of athletic mismatches a Patriot League entrant typically would.
The biggest concern for Bucknell 
should be Joe Willman’s ability to match up with athletic point-power-forward Roosevelt Jones. If there’s a mismatch to be had, Butler coach Brad Stevens will find it. 
Davidson
Led by the duo of Jake Cohen and 
De’Mon Brooks, the Wildcats have the 
bodies to match up with Marquette’s frontcourt.
Davidson is an experienced unit that 
returns all five starters from last year’s tournament team, but the Wildcats will have to prove they can guard Marquette on the perimeter. Vander Blue, especial-ly, will prove difficult to contain.

Lauren Haeger had the luck of the Irish 
with her on St. Patrick’s Day.
The sophomore belted the game-tying 
and game-winning home runs as No. 3 
Florida (27-3, 4-2 Southeastern Conference) took the weekend series from No. 6 Ten-nessee (23-6, 3-3 SEC) with a 5-3 victory on Sunday.
“I wore my lucky shamrocks today,” 
Haeger said of her green earrings. 
Haeger didn’t need luck in her first two 
plate appearances, drawing walks on 3-2 and 3-0 counts. But when she did get a chance to swing, she made her own good fortune.
With the Gators down by three in the 
sixth inning, Haeger came to the plate with Kelsey Stewart and Kirsti Merritt on base. She unleashed on the 1-2 delivery from Vol-unteers pitcher Ellen Renfroe and sent it over the fence in left-center field to tie the game.
The two teams went to extra innings for 
the third consecutive game after neither scored in the seventh.
Fortunately for the Gators, Haeger came 
to the plate in the eighth with Stewart on base again.“I was really just thinking base hit,” Hae-
ger said.
Stewart thought differently.“I actually thought they were going to 
walk her,” Stewart said. “But once they threw that first strike … I was like, ‘She’s about to hit a home run.’”
Haeger drove the 0-1 pitch to nearly 
the same spot as her first blast, and she ran home into a mass of Gators surrounding home plate.
Before Haeger’s home run, Florida strug-
gled on offense.
Renfroe started for the second straight 
day. She struck out 14 batters on Saturday, but the Gators made adjustments before Sunday’s game and limited the junior right-hander to five punch outs in five-plus in-nings of work. 
Haeger said the team switched to heavier 
bats for Sunday’s game to counter Renfroe’s effective off-speed pitches. 
“We were missing the ball by 10 feet yes-
terday,” she said. 
Coach Tim Walton said Renfroe pitched 
well on Sunday, but he chalked up the dif-ference in results to Florida’s adjustments.
