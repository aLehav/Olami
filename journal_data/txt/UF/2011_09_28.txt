  Votes in this week’s Student Govern-
ment elections might not count if SG ofﬁ  -
cials agree with a Students Party petition that claims results are invalid. 
  Students Party member Jonathan Ossip 
told the UF Supreme Court that the elec-tion should be redone because of technical and administrative errors with the elec-tronic voting system. 
  Supervisor of elections Toni Megna said 
Tuesday’s votes tallied in at 5,486. Megna said she was advised not to further break down the results by voting location.
  During elections Tuesday, the comput-
ers used for voting didn’t match students’ addresses and voting districts, Megna said, which she said was corrected by link-ing the voting system with students’ ad-dresses from the Ofﬁ  ce of the University Registrar.
  However, many students have their per-
manent home addresses listed, not their lo-cal ones. When the computer system read this, Megna said, it placed those students in voting District E, which includes all ZIP codes except those listed in Districts A, B, C and D.
  Students who didn’t catch the mistake 
when the computer veriﬁ  ed their district would have proceeded to the voting page, which would list the candidates for Dis-trict E.
  Anyone who tried to vote under District 
E after the problem was corrected in the af-ternoon had to complete an afﬁ  davit with his or her address to make sure he or she was zoned for District E.
  Once a student had viewed the voting 
page, he or she could not go back or vote again, Megna said.
  She said students should pay attention 
to their voting district and know their ZIP code.

  A bake sale on the University of California, Berkeley 
campus Tuesday afternoon stirred up national attention 
with its pricing. 
  Baked goods were sold to white males for $2, Asian 
men for $1.50, Latino men for $1, black men for 75 cents and Native American men for 25 cents. Women could pur-chase baked goods for 25 cents off those prices.
  The bake sale was an effort to protest legislation that 
would require admissions ofﬁ  cials to take an applicant’s race, gender and ethnicity into account when making ad-missions decisions. 
  The bill was passed by the California state legislature 
and must be either signed into law or vetoed by Gov. Jerry Brown by Oct. 9.
  Bake sales like these have been held on college cam-
puses since the ‘90s. In some instances, like at Bucknell University, the College of William and Mary and the Uni-versity of California, Irvine, university ofﬁ  cials stepped in to stop the sales.
  Clay Calvert, a UF professor of Law of Mass Commu-
nication, said this type of interference violates students’ First Amendment rights to freedom of expression on col- Berkeley bake sale protests using race to determine admissions� THE PLAN CALLS FOR A

  Students and faculty may soon 
look down the hill on Newell 
Drive to see the Health Science Center’s equivalent of Century Tower.
  Under the UF&Shands label, 
UF hopes to build a $40 million, 100,000-square-foot building for the College of Medicine.
  The building would be the ar-
chitectural symbol of the medi-cal campus, said David Guzick, senior vice president for health affairs and president of the UF&Shands Health System.
  “It is a symbolic idea that 
would connect the two parts of campus,” Guzick said.
  The structure, tentatively 
called the UF Health Science Ed-ucation building, would be built next to the Health Professions/Nursing/Pharmacy Complex on College of 
Medicine may get new center on campus

� FLU SEASON STARTS IN 
THE FALL AND ENDS IN THE SPRING.
EMILY MORROW
Alligator Writer
Morgan Conn doesn’t get an an-
nual flu shot because it’s not vegan. 
David Byron said he doesn’t get one because he heard it makes you sick. John Richter said he’s just lazy.
The UF Student Health Care 
Center is working to put student concerns and misconceptions to rest with the annual flu shot cam-paign next Monday.
From Monday on, students can 
get free flu shots at the Infirmary and the Student Health Care Center at Shands. Shots will also be offered at campus locations like the Reitz Union Colonnade, the Plaza of the Americas and several residence halls on specific days throughout the next few months. The complete schedule can be viewed at shcc.ufl.edu/services/primary-care/flu. The shots are $20 for faculty, staff and spouses of UF students.
“The flu shot is not only about 
protecting the person who gets the shot, it’s also about protecting ev-eryone around them,” said Cath-erine Seemann, spokeswoman for the UF SHCC. “It’s especially im-portant if you’re on campus — you have no idea who sat in your desk or chair before you and sneezed all over.”Flu season typically starts in the 
fall, peaks in January and Febru-ary and tapers off in the spring, she said.
The vaccine is developed each year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention based on research that predicts what three strains of the influenza virus will be most common that upcoming year. Seemann said one of the most 
common misconceptions about the shot is that it will make you sick.
The flu shot contains a killed, or 
inactive, virus. The immune system recognizes the flu strains and cre-ates defenses but does not actually transmit the virus.
It takes the body about two 
weeks to create the correct defenses after getting the shot. If someone were to be exposed to the virus prior to the shot or during that two-week window, they could still fall ill, she said. 
The vaccines have been tradi-
tionally produced in chicken eggs — a practice that may concern veg-ans and people with egg allergies. However, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ website, a new, cell-based method of vaccine production is ex-pected to begin later this year. The batch UF SHCC is using this year was produced in chicken eggs.
The UF SHCC has 5,000 vaccines 
on hand,  Seemann said, and is hop-ing to order more.
“By getting the shot, you’re re-
ally doing yourself and the people around you a favor,” Seemann said. “Getting that vaccination that takes five minutes and doesn’t really hurt too much is the best protection you can have.”

Adult film actor Ron Jeremy will be in 
Gainesville today to promote a new spiced 
rum that bears his name — Ron de Jeremy — and to hear any suggestions for a slo-gan.His take?“Any other rum doesn’t have a third leg 
to stand on,” he said. 
Jeremy will appear to sign bottles of the 
new spiced rum at University Liquors at 105 SW 34th St. from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. and at Gator Beverage at 1126 W University Ave. from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. 
Jeremy, whose first 
name is the Spanish word for rum, isn’t much of a drinker, but he said he 
loves the thrill of endors-ing a product and seeing it succeed.
Besides, he said, he was the only famous 
Ron available.“Ron Reagan died, Ron Howard’s mak-
ing movies, and I’ll do anything,” he said.
Jeremy said he’s interested to see if any-
one can come up with a catchy slogan for the rum. He also encouraged students to be careful.
“Drink responsibly,” he said. “If you’ve 
got homework to do, do not drink my rum. You want to drink when you got recre-ational time.” Adult film star to promote name-bearing spiced rum

AlAchu A county
MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Staff Writer
Gainesville and Newberry officials are 
trying to persuade the Alachua County 
Commission to put the Alachua County Fairgrounds in their respective stomping grounds.
The city that secures the fairgrounds 
is expected to get the tourism that comes with the horse shows and large-scale festi-vals held on the county-owned site every year.
Whichever city can persuade the com-
mission that its site is better for the coun-ty will reap the benefits. But it’s possible they’ll have competition.
The commission noted last week it 
would consider moving the fairgrounds from Gainesville to Newberry, but it also opened the floor for a month to other pro-posals for projects that use money from the county tourist development tax, a 2-cent fee that is added onto bills at hotels, mo-tels, camp sites and short-term rentals. The terms allow for the possibility for other cit-ies to pitch in for the fairgrounds.
The Alachua County Fair this year is scheduled to kick off Oct. 22 at the cur -
rent fairgrounds location just south of the Gainesville Regional Airport. 
The fair will eventually move to the 
chosen location after the county decides where to put the fairgrounds and any necessary construction is finished. Right now, there is no set date for moving the fairgrounds.
The county’s current plan is to move 
the grounds to about 148 acres of land the county bought on Northeast Waldo Road in east Gainesville. Half of that land, about 75 acres, would be used for the fair -
grounds, said Robert Avery, the county’s parks superintendent.
The county will decide whether that 
plan will change after the requests have been submitted for tourist development tax projects.
Mark Sexton, spokesman for Alachua 
County, said the commission wants to be fair to all of the cities in the county, includ-ing Newberry.
“The commission just wants to give the 
City of Newberry its due,” Sexton said.
Gainesville officials aren’t thrilled about 
the possible change of location.Gainesville Mayor Craig Lowe sent a 
letter to county commissioners last week, which asked them to keep the fairgrounds in Gainesville to avoid the possible percep-tion that they aren’t interested in develop-ing that part of the county.
“Such action may well encourage public 
perception that there is a lack of commit-ment to revitalize economic development 
in east Alachua County or worse still, that an impartial, equitable and transparent allocation process has been arbi-trarily compromised and 
circumvented,” Lowe’s letter reads.
Gainesville City Com-
missioner Thomas Hawk-
ins said he’s concerned that buying a new piece of land for the fairgrounds when the county already owns land in Gainesville is an unwise use of taxpayers’ money.
Newberry Mayor Bill Conrad said it 
would be cheaper for the county to choose Newberry because it already has a devel-oped space for the fairgrounds at its Can-terbury Equestrian Showplace.He said it would cost between $4 mil-
lion and $6 million for the county to buy the roughly 86-acre site. The site has not yet been appraised. It would cost between $7 million and $8 million to fix before the fairgrounds could start hosting events.
The Waldo Road site wouldn’t cost the 
county anything to buy because the county already owns it. 
The county bought the land for $2 mil-
lion during the 2006-2007 fiscal year. It would take about $22 million to get the fairgrounds in working order. More im-provements could follow later.
Conrad said horse, cattle and agricul-
ture shows usually fill fairground agendas, and residents of Newberry are frequent faces at those events. 
If the fairgrounds move to Newberry, 
he said, the county land in Gainesville will be freed up to create an industrial park where businesses could create jobs in the city.
“It’s kind of a win-win situation both 
for east Gainesville and for Newberry,” Conrad said. “But we need to do a better job at getting people to understand why it’s best for both.”

Gas prices across Florida have dropped 7 cents per gallon over the last week. The tax on 
gas in Alachua is 37 cents on the dollar.

Alligator Writer
It costs Ariel Cohen, a 19-year-old 
nursing sophomore, $45 to fill up her 
2002 Mazda Protege5.
She usually fills up her car every 2 
1/2 weeks, depending on how often she drives and whether she goes to Tampa to visit her boyfriend, Kyle.
The recent drop in gas prices has left 
her feeling happier and her wallet feel-ing a bit heavier.
“The less money I have to spend on 
gas, the better,” Cohen said.
Cohen’s not the only person happy 
with the price at the pump. 
In the past week, gas prices have 
fallen 7 cents across Florida, and the cheaper prices are allowing people to save and spend money elsewhere.
The average price for a gallon of reg-
ular unleaded gas in Florida is $3.47, according to ongoing price analysis by AAA. That’s 7 cents cheaper than last week and 21 cents cheaper than a year ago.
Gas prices have dropped because of 
increased oil production in Libya and a declining worldwide demand for fuel, according to AAA’s weekly news re-lease on gas prices.
At $3.45 per gallon, the Kangaroo 
gas station at Southwest 34th Street and Southwest 35th Place has the cheapest gas in Gainesville, according to Justin Diggs, the store manager.
Diggs said customers have been ask-
ing questions about the price of gas and are excited about the decrease.
Those who want cheaper gas can 
drive 30 minutes south to Marion County, where gas prices are as low as $3.26 per gallon.
Gasoline prices may vary based on 
county and state taxes and how many people live in the area, said Jessica Bra-dy, AAA spokeswoman. 
The taxes on gas for Marion and Ala-
chua counties are the same at 35 cents per dollar.
John Xanthos, a 19-year-old account-
ing sophomore,  spends about $80 every three weeks to fill up the 22-gallon tank in his 2001 Dodge Durango. He said he thinks gas prices are still too high.
“I still remember when gas was 
$1.25 a gallon,” Xanthos said.
Prices are predicted to drop again 
this week.Gas prices drop across state

UF students can help the Crimson Tide one T-shirt at a 
time. 
In response to the tornadoes that tore through Tuscaloosa 
in April, students in the College of Health and Human Perfor -
mance have organized a campaign to raise money for tornado 
relief efforts at the University of Alabama.
The campaign, known as Champions Helping Champions, 
consists of selling T-shirts for the University of Alabama Acts of Kindness Fund.
So far, the campaign has sold about 300 T-shirts and raised 
about $4,500. The fund gives aid to university students and employees directly affected by the tornadoes in Tuscaloosa.The idea was first brought to Beth Chaney’s attention by 
Rachel Bush and Kristin Rucker, undergraduates in UF’s De-partment of Health Education and Behavior. 
Chaney, an assistant professor in the  department, became 
interested in the cause for personal reasons and because she wanted to lend a hand to a college town in need of assistance.
“I grew up in Alabama and received my bachelor’s and 
master’s degrees from the University of Alabama,” Chaney said. “I have friends and family that live in Alabama and some that are in Tuscaloosa.”
Members of Eta Sigma Gamma, a health education honor -ary, have also supported the cause by organizing the sale of the T-shirts.
“We want to do as much as we can because Alabama is 
still recovering from the devastation,” said Eta Sigma Gamma President Sarah Napolitano. 
The T-shirts display an alligator and an elephant holding 
hands and read “Champions Helping Champions” at the bot-tom.
“The shirts simply remind people that there is still work to 
be done in Alabama,” Napolitano said.
Students are being asked to wear the T-shirts to the UF vs. 
Alabama game Saturday to show their support. The cost for each shirt is $15, and they will be on sale until Saturday at the Florida Gym.
T-shirts are also available online on the College of Health 
and Human Performance website. The shirts can be shipped anywhere in the United States.UF students sell shirts to raise money for Alabama tornado relieflowe

An official name will not be 
determined until the Board of 
Trustees approves the project.
The building would accom-
modate a new medical school curriculum, which emphasizes small group learning spaces, stimulation activities and tech-nology learning. 
The current building, which 
was built in the 1970s and con-tains large lecture halls and lab rooms, is inadequate for the new teaching concepts. 
“We are creating the form 
that fits the function of the cur -
riculum,” Guzick said.
At least half of the funding 
for the project would come from donations. A number of people have already expressed inter -
est in donating money, Guzick said. “There has been a lot of en-
thusiastic support,” Guzick said. “It’s very encouraging, but we can’t say we will definitely proceed.”
Once there is enough fund-
ing, the building plans will go to the Board of Trustees for ap-proval. 
Construction on the building 
will hopefully begin this aca-demic year, Guzick said.
Two other UF&Shands fa-
cilities are currently under con-struction.
The first is a primary practice 
office called UF&Shands Family Medicine on Main Street, which will replace the Family Medi-cine at Fourth Avenue practice. 
The second will be a spe-
cialty care medical office on Northwest 39th Avenue, which will include specialists in der -
matology, women’s health and neurology. WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 5

Fifty-two performers from 14 different 
countries will perform for 2 1/2 hours at the 
Stephen C. O’Connell Center when Cirque du Soleil comes to Gainesville next month. 
UF will host “Dralion” (pronounced “dra-
lee-on”) for three shows from Oct. 11 to Oct. 13. Doors will open at 6:30 p.m. each night. Tickets range from $31 to $90.
“Dralion” audience members will see 10 
acrobatic numbers, including clown comedy , contortionist acts and live musical perfor -
mances, said Julie Desmarais, spokeswoman for the show.
Performers use equipment like trampo-lines, a 50-foot-by-26-foot metallic wall and about 1,500 costume pieces.
Cirque du Soleil last came to campus in 
May 2009 when the O’Connell Center hosted six performances of the “Saltimbanco” show, said O’Connell Center director Lynda Rein-hart.
Reinhart’s staff started working to figure 
out when the company could return almost immediately following their visit.
For “Dralion,” Reinhart expects 3,000 to 
4,000 people to attend per night. 
Jennifer Sato, a 19-year-old business soph-
omore, is looking forward to “Dralion.”
“I’ve always wished that I could be able 
to do some of the contortion and acrobatic moves that the performers do,” Sato said.Cirque du Soleil show to

Students on campus may soon be able 
to dismiss their phones’ “low battery” 
warnings with confidence.
Student Senate gave preliminary ap-
proval Tuesday night to legislation that would earmark money for six new cell-phone recharging stations.
The proposed bill called for $28,800 to 
be appropriated to the SG Cabinet under the vice president to purchase the sta-tions, which cost $4,800 each. 
The stations can charge as many as 10 
devices within 15 minutes, said Budget and Allocations Chairman Andrew Ma-son.There is currently a recharging station 
in the UF Bookstore in the first floor of the Reitz Union that Mason said has seen positive student response.
Minority Sen. Kyle Collins called the 
amount “exorbitant.”
“It’s a perfect example of more SG 
waste,” he said.
The bill passed the first round of the

Students Party will file for a hearing with UF Supreme CourtUF College Republicans hosted similar event in February
“Before they sit down to vote, they should know what 
district they live in,” she said.
However, Ossip argued that students weren’t educated 
about the system and that the screen was misleading.
“Nobody’s properly explaining it to them at all,” he 
said. Ossip said many students might have voted under 
the wrong district.
Because of these problems, Ossip and the Students Par -ty scheduled an emergency hearing with the UF Supreme Court for Tuesday night. Under Florida law, the public must be no-tified of a meeting 24 hours in advance, but Ossip said continuing elections would cause “irreparable damages.” 
Student Body Chief Justice Matt Mi-
chel and three Associate Justices ruled that they could not hold the hearing be-
cause they were uncomfortable interpreting state law in-stead of the UF Constitution, which is what they interpret.
Unite Party spokeswoman Christina Bonarrigo said she 
isn’t worried about an issue going unresolved.
“If there is a problem, it will go through the channels it 
needs to,” she said.
Ossip said the Students Party will file for a hearing, but 
he doesn’t know when. Michel said that when a meeting date, time and place have been agreed upon, the informa-tion will be posted in the SG Office at least 24 hours in ad -
vance.lege campuses.
“This is precisely the type of speech 
that the First Amendment was intended to protect,” he said. “The reality is that such bake sales call attention to larger issues over which there is much disagreement in the United States today.”
The UF College Republicans hosted a 
similar sale in February to protest affirma-tive action.Eric Weber, executive director of the 
organization, said the bake sale was not meant to be racist but to draw attention to the argument that affirmative action sys-tems should be based on socioeconomic status — the real culprit, he said — rather than race.
Under regulations made by the Florida 
Board of Governors, the body that regu-lates all Florida public universities, dis-crimination based on traits like race, sex or national origin is forbidden. Programs to increase diversity, on the 
other hand, are not.
However, UF does not currently em-
ploy any type of affirmative action when making admissions decisions. Admissions officials take a holistic approach — look-ing at all factors of a candidate, including socioeconomic status, according to the ad-missions website.
“Florida is working in the right direc-
tion,” Weber said. 
“We were just trying to say that we dis-
agree with the fundamental belief that af-firmative action has to be based on race, when socioeconomic status seems to be the real issue.”

People need to shut up 
about the changes
The American people are mad. 
Are they mad about the next possible government 
shutdown? No, not really.
Are they mad about the fact that Rick Santorum is a moron 
hell-bent on out social-conservative-ing every other GOP nomi-
nee by saying he’ll re-instate Don’t Ask Don’t Tell? No, not re-ally.
Are they mad about President Barack Obama’s Solyndra 
scandal where he endorsed a government loan to a green energy company that was financially insecure? No, not really.
Mess with people’s Facebook and all hell breaks loose. So over the past couple of weeks, Facebook has been making 
some changes to its layout. For Facebook users, this means the end of the world as we know it. 
Yes, Facebook “Inception’d” you by placing a news feed in 
the corner of your news feed. 
Can you still post a status update to complain about this 
change? Yes. 
Can you still post links to pictures of Xzibit saying that he 
heard you liked Facebook, so he put a Facebook in your Face-book so you could Facebook while you Facebook? Yes. 
Can you still upload photos of you flicking off Mark Zuck-
erburg? Yes. 
Facebook is still Facebook, and it will always be Facebook no 
matter how much they change it. 
Remember when they first installed the chat feature and ev-
eryone complained about how it never worked and was worse than AIM? 
The majority of Facebook users use chat more than their mes-
sage inboxes, which are now interconnected so that your conver -
sations are saved. That’s actually kind of cool. 
Facebook also went Google+ by reforming its existing friends 
“lists” to filter your news feed. Do you really like getting up-dates from every “friend” you have? Probably not. 
But whether or not the changes are for better or worse, the 
main point is this: 
IT DOESN’T MATTER.  Facebook is a free, convenient service that everyone uses to 
connect with people. As long as it serves this purpose, what is there to complain about? 
If you really are pissed off at Facebook, stop using it. Other -
wise, stop whining. 
And of course, earlier this week some morons convinced 
gullible suckers (again) that Facebook was going to start charg-ing for usage. 
Did you really think that copying and pasting a status would 
exempt you from being charged? How in the hell would they track that? Why would they make it so easy to become exempt? 
In the grand scheme of things, your life has not gotten any 
more difficult because of these changes, yet everyone has acted like it has ruined his or her very existence. 
It’s unfortunate that we have to devote an editorial to this 
nonsense, but a) it’s a slow news day and b) we want people to start worrying about things that really matter.Women play an influential role in politics
I have a humble rebuttal to last Tuesday’s column 
“Politics Needs Better Female Role Models” by Sami Main. I reject the premise that today’s young women 
do not have anyone to look up to. 
Women are more prominent than ever. Ms. Main 
turned a blind eye to some of the strongest and most bril-liant minds of the past century. 
“Young women today often have very little appre-
ciation for the real battles that took place to get women where they are today in this country. I don’t know how much history young women today know about those battles.” Guess who said that? It was none other than for -
mer U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor.
Main had it out for two very specific women: Sarah 
Palin and Michele Bachmann.
She writes, “Sarah Palin took that to mean being more 
rogue, more every-woman and more detached from the news media. She basically became a complete caricature of herself.”
To be upfront, the quote warrants a very finite amount 
of merit. Palin is by no means a stupid woman, but her attempts to paint herself as an “average Jane” often make her come across as a simpleton. 
Bachmann falls into a similar category.“Bachmann is just another example of how important 
extremes are to this nation. If someone isn’t making a scene, they’re not going to earn press. And I think we all know Bachmann likes a scene. Women in politics will not be listened to unless they are causing a ruckus — that is a little absurd to me,” she continues. 
Although she may have a point, the behavior of these 
two female public figures is not exclusive to women. Instead, it describes the behavior of almost everyone in politics and entertainment. 
To gain political traction, you need showmanship. 
Both men and women put on a charade to be palpable to the American public, even though it might leave some scratching their heads.
Palin certainly has the star quality with a huge fol-lowing, and Bachmann says some statements that fly out of nowhere. But it brings publicity, which is what they desire. 
However, Main discounts 
the serious women who exist outside this media “circus” and  deserve credit for their achieve-ments. 
In the 1980s, Margaret 
Thatcher was the first woman to lead a Western political party and the first female prime minister. 
During her term, she battled the former Soviet Union 
and came down on power-hungry labor unions, earning her the nickname “Iron Lady.” She also survived an as-sassination attempt during her time in office. 
For something a little closer to home, what about Hil-
lary Clinton? She is intelligent and respectable, her hus-band notwithstanding. Only four years ago she hit the campaign trail as a senator from New York. Although she lost the bid for the White House, she is the third woman to hold the position of Secretary of State. 
We cannot discount women like Condoleezza Rice, 
Ruth Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Janet Napolitano, who are all great examples of how far our country has come in accepting females as political lead-ers. 
Politics aside, women play prominent roles in society 
throughout the media, entertainment and business (such as Meg Whitman of eBay Inc., Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo Inc. and Irene Rosenfeld of Kraft Foods Inc.). Right now is a great time to be a woman. 
Gents, our female counterparts deserve our respect 
and appreciation for what they accomplish. Ladies, do not ever forget that these women broke the glass ceiling, increasing your opportunities as you embark on your ca-reers.

Columnist needs to get the facts straight
In today’s economy, I understand the criticism of govern-
ment spending. What I do not understand are outrageous fact 
errors and misconceptions of Student Government at UF that were displayed in Monday’s column. 
First off, all of these numbers are rounded and are for the 
2011-2012 fiscal year.
SG has a $4.8 million dollar budget, not $16.7 million. The 
$16.7 million referred to is the Activity and Service Fee Budget, which is split three ways between the operations for the Reitz Union at $6.2 million, RecSports at $5.7 million, and lastly SG. SG’s portion of the Activity and Service Fee Budget is $4.8 mil-lion. Each student pays $3.93 a credit hour or $117.90 based on a 30-credit-hour year for SG, not $436.50 (as claimed by both Monday’s column and the Students Party Guest Column). 
Again, these next numbers are rounded. SG’s budget for the 
2011-2012 fiscal year can be broken down between $1.6 million for the organizational budget (including academic organiza-tions, graduate student council, new student organizations and special events), about $1 million for Accent Speakers’ Bureau and Student Government Productions, about $500,000 for Stu-dent Legal Services, about $500,000 for miscellaneous services (free bike repair, free printing, the Housing Fair, CPA ticket subsidy , readership programs, welcome assemblies, Museum Nights, etc.) and the rest for staff salaries and IT that help us manage the entire operation.
As far as the SG “perks” mentioned, none of them come 
from students’ money . Students do not pay for SG officials’ BlackBerrys. 
Also, a Hungry Howie’s pizza for a student organization is 
the same for a regular person: $5. There are codes and regula-tions against frivolous spending (both state law and SG statutes found in the 800 codes) so organizations can’t wastefully spend their money.  
Organizations are not guaranteed to lose their budgeted 
money if they don’t spend it. All registered student organiza-tions already have access to meeting rooms; SG does not hinder this. All of this is public, so please fact check before making as-sumptions. 
After correcting these factual errors, I would love to write 
a thesis on the benefits and services SG provides for students and how it reaches out to tens of thousands of students every day and how graduate students actually get more funding pro-portionally than undergrads. However, you can check the SG website for more information or come by the third floor of the Reitz Union and meet some SG officials. 
I encourage all students to stop and talk to us when we table 
and hold public forums or ask us anything by email or through our office hours. We would love to hear your thoughts and ex-plain exactly how SG works and how students benefit from SG. But first, I want you to focus on two things:
First, SG at UF is completely student-run. Talk to students 
from the University of Georgia, the University of Texas at Aus-tin, Ohio State University or just about anyone else across the nation, and they will tell you they are fed up because their re-spective administrations control their activity fees and take any leftover money . 
UF students have complete control over SG reserves and 
where our money should be allocated.  We should be thrilled we are all Gators because we have the most say out of any Stu-dent Body and are by far the most influential within our cam-pus. This is a student-centered campus, and I say that proudly . 
Lastly , I encourage you to use your voice and vote in SG 
elections today . Your vote allows you to have direct say over where SG money should be allocated. Polls are open between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Be proud, be smart and opinionated, but most of all, be factually correct. 
Thank you, and Go Gators!

Obama isn’t “walking on egg shells”
Regarding this week’s cartoon of President Barack Obama 
“walking on egg shells” around the Middle East conflict, I would like to point out that Obama and his administration have taken a clear stance on the Palestinians’ recent request for statehood. In his address to the U.N. General Assembly , Obama reasserted his stance that negotiations are the only path to peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. 
Through his speech he reaffirmed his support for Israel, 
America’s strongest ally and the only democracy in the Middle East.
As a student senator, I was a proud author of the Student 
Government resolution in support of direct negotiations and in opposition to a unilateral declaration, which overwhelmingly passed 66-to-1. This resolution stands with members of Con-gress, who passed a similar resolution supporting the US-Israel relationship and direct negotiations in this time of great need. 
I understand there is no shortcut to end a conflict that has 
lasted for decades. Obama, Congress and the Student Senate recognize that the recent move by the Palestinian Authority to seek unilateral U.N. recognition for statehood represents an abandonment of good faith negotiations and is an effort to dip-lomatically isolate Israel.

� SHE WILL EXPLAIN HOW GAMING CAN SOLVE 
SOME REAL-WORLD PROBLEMS.
KATHERINE KALLERGIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Jane McGonigal, renowned game developer and an 
expert on alternate reality games, will speak in a special 
forum at the Bob Graham Center for Public Service on Oct. 4. 
McGonigal is a leader in the growing movement to 
create online games rooted in real-world problems. She is The New York Times best-selling author of “Reality is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World.”
Shelby Taylor, digital communications director for 
the Bob Graham Center for Public Service, said she ex-
pects about 150 people to attend.
McGonigal has listed hunger, pov-
erty, climate change and obesity as problems that gaming could solve by the next decade.
“What we want to do is make the fu-
ture,” she said at a TED conference last year. “We want to imagine the best-case scenario and then we want to empower 
people to make that outcome a reality.”
McGonigal has already designed games that combine 
cutting-edge graphics with examinations of real-world problems. 
After McGonigal speaks, there will be a Q-and-A ses-
sion. The event will be streamed live at bobgrahamcen-ter.ufl.edu. 
“Games are a powerful platform for change,” McGoni-
gal said. “Let the world-changing games begin.”AMANDA COHEN

Despite the heat, about 2,500 stu-
dents packed into the Stephen C. 
O’Connell Center Tuesday, donning jackets, dress pants or knee-length skirts in hopes of landing those pro-spective jobs or internships.
The showcase has been a regular 
event in the Fall and Spring since the 1980s, said Angel Iverson, assistant di-rector for career events.
Iverson said the number of em-
ployers this year has increased to 284 corporations from 265 last fall.
“I’m seeing more diverse opportu-
nities for students,” Iverson said. “In the past, the majority of students were business and engineering students.”
Opportunities are available in 
sales, marketing, business, engineer -
ing, IT, healthcare, banking, advertis-
ing and agriculture. 
Psychology senior Ilexis Elba, 21, 
said she’s not sure exactly what career 
path she wants to take but expects the showcase to give her some insight.
Accounting firm recruiter Ed Cran-
ford, of Orlando-based Averett War -
mus Durkee Osburn Henning, said it’s imperative students dress the part.
“Appearance makes a difference,” 
said Cranford, 35. “I expect the stu-dents who are serious about getting a job with us to dress professionally , especially at a nationally recognized university.”
The Career Showcase is sponsored by UF’s Career Resource Center and will also be held today from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the O’Connell Center.8, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 28, 2011

� ROSH HASHANA BEGINS TODAY.
DIANA LOPEZ
Alligator Contributing Writer 
If you’ve heard a sound similar to a 
horn recently in Turlington Plaza, it’s 
probably Jeffrey Kaplan with his sho-far.
UF Hillel will be hosting a series of 
events and services to celebrate Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year, which begins today and will end at sunset on Friday.
Kaplan, program director at Hillel, 
will be organizing a series of shofar flash mobs this year and is aiming for about 300 people to attend and blow mini sho-fars, or ram horns, to remind students the High Holidays are here.
On Tuesday there were three flash 
mobs on the Plaza of the Americas. To-day there will be another flash mob at Turlington Plaza at 12:40 p.m. 
Kaplan has been in Turlington Plaza 
for the past week handing out toy sho-fars to passers-by. Kaplan said the sho-far has been used in the Jewish culture for centuries as a call of worship.
“What I’m doing goes back thou-
sands of years,” he said.
Kaplan said Rosh Hashana is a day 
of introspection and a day for asking for forgiveness. 
Students who wish to attend the 
Hillel services are encouraged to make meal reservations at ufhillel.org.  For more information on the shofar flash mob, visit Hillel’s Facebook event page.Hillel rings in Jewish new yearWomen’s rights

Women in Saudi Arabia are getting a right 
that women in the United States have had 
since 1920. 
King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia on 
Sunday granted women the right to vote and run in municipal elections.  Although there is an election next week, wom-en will not participate in it. The first election that women can participate in will be in 2015. 
Abdullah also announced women will 
now be allowed to be appointed to the Shura Council, the advisory body that the king se-lects. Currently , the council consists only of males. 
The Association of Saudi Arabian Students 
at UF welcomed the reform. 
“I’m always glad to hear any reform steps 
that the kingdom [does], and that includes giving women the right to vote,” said Ahmed AlBassam, the organization’s vice president. 
Ammar Naji, the treasurer of the organiza-
tion, said the decision reflects women’s previ-ous achievements in society.
“The initiative recognizes women’s politi-
cal role and puts them in the heart of society where their rightful place is as a citizen, wife, mother, daughter and partner in building the society,” he said.
Although the association doesn’t have any-
thing planned for this particular reform, they will be celebrating Saudi Arabia National Day on Friday in the Rion Ballroom B Half from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., according to Naji.Saudi Arabians welcome reform

Rainey and Jeff Demps, who have combined 
for 765 rushing yards and six scores on the ground.Although Harrison said he is sure Florida 
will be able to establish the run against Ala-bama, the Gators will be facing a tough test, as the Crimson Tide’s run defense ranks third in the nation (45.75 yards per game allowed).“It’s a line-of-scrimmage game,” Harrison 
said. “If the offensive line does their job, and does their job successfully, then the offense in general will have more success.”
Patience key: Offensive coordinator Char -
lie Weis said Tuesday that Alabama’s defense is solid at all 11 spots on the field and that the Gators need to play fundamentally sound against the Tide if they want to come out on top.
“Sometimes when you’re playing football 
you have to realize that punting isn’t neces-sarily a bad thing,” Weis said. “What you have to do is make sure you make good de-cisions in the game where you don’t make a critical mistake … and all of a sudden give one to them.”
While Weis said the Gators need to be cau-
tious in not making bad decisions, he added Florida will be sure to empty its playbook on the field Saturday night.
“You have to go ahead and throw the 
kitchen sink at them now,” he said. “They’re going to get the kitchen sink. You guys have been writing about holding things back, well you won’t have to worry about that this week.”
Brantley fine: Weis said quarterback John 
Brantley, who briefly exited the Kentucky game after taking a couple of hard hits, is healthy and took “most of the reps” in prac-tice Tuesday, an encouraging sign for the of-fensive coordinator.
“He’s glad the game is still a few days 
away,” Weis said. “But he’s moving along nicely. He’s progressing nicely. He threw the ball well [Tuesday].”
Etc.: Defensive tackle Omar Hunter said 
the injured finger in his right hand is getting better and that he hopes the protective mitt he has been wearing during games will be even smaller this weekend.
Contact Tom Green at tgreen@alligator.org.division powerhouses (Alabama, 
LSU), improve as the year goes on, beat the only other contenders in the East (Georgia, South Carolina) and reach the SEC championship.
Matt: That sounds eerily similar 
to a season ago, when the Gators went to Tuscaloosa, Ala., fired up and ready to show the world they meant business. Instead, ‘Bama sent them into a hole they could never climb out of. 
Three straight losses in October 
drained most of what positive en-ergy remained around the program, and with the SEC East on the line against South Carolina in Novem-ber, the Gators laid an egg. 
Muschamp has looked exhaust-
ed and on the verge of losing his sanity after wins against UAB and FAU; what’s going to happen when he gets that first loss in the books? 
Right now, we don’t know if 
losing could mean this team is a volatile volcano waiting to erupt or a focused group that won’t pin its season on one game. 
I’m betting on the former. Tyler: Florida didn’t play bad 
last year because it was blown out against Alabama. Florida played bad because Florida was bad.
If the Gators didn’t have the 
Crimson Tide on their schedule last year, they still would have dropped those October games to the Tigers and the Bulldogs. Prior to the Ala-bama loss, we had plenty of reasons to think Florida would struggle. Cue the Miami (Ohio) game tape.
Similarly , this season won’t be 
determined in a 60-minute stretch Saturday. Yes, a victory would pro-vide an emotional lift. And yeah, a loss will be disappointing. Losses always are. But win or lose, Florida will have seven games left on its regular-season schedule.
Matt: Those are facts, yes, 
but this game has the poten-tial to set a blueprint for stop-ping Florida in the future.  We have never seen Chris Rainey and Jeff Demps be as effective as they have been this season. 
Much of the credit goes to Weis 
for drawing up plays to get them in space, but that may not matter going forward. Weis said Tuesday he’s going to open up the playbook against Alabama. 
What happens when the pages 
stick together?
What happens when Nick Saban 
shows Muschamp who’s the boss?
What happens when defenses 
shut down Demps and Rainey and force John Brantley and his unim-pressive corps of receivers to beat them? 
Missed snaps aside, the Florida 
offense looked somewhat impres-sive coming into last year’s Ala-bama game — similar to this year. But after the shellacking in Bryant-Denny Stadium, the Gators had three losses in which they failed to score more than 14 points. 
While many things are different 
this time around, the Alabama game very well could be the downfall of a 4-0 Florida team. Again.

ence game. 
“This is why they go to Alabama, this is why 
we come to Florida — to play big games like this,” Burton said. “It’s an SEC team, so you get a little more excited for SEC games than non-conference games.”
Although the days of Urban Meyer pump-
ing up the Gators prior to pivotal showdowns are gone, Brantley acknowledged that certain games still bring a higher level of intensity, even as preparation remains constant. 
“Different games bring different intensity,” 
Brantley said Monday. “But we try to be as in-tense from game one to game 10. You always want to bring that.”
When pressed on where Saturday’s match-
up with Alabama ranks on the intensity scale, Brantley said, “It’s pretty high, probably.”
Twelve times a Florida player has said that 
the team’s approach is to prepare, play or work hard this week — nothing different from what UF did prior to matchups with FAU, UAB, Ten-nessee or Kentucky. 
“It’s nothing new to us, we’re just going to 
prepare and play to the best of our ability,” sophomore defensive end Sharrif Floyd said. 
Although Florida and Alabama’s show-
downs have held major national championship implications as recently as 2008 and 2009, the Gators have refused to build the hype. 
For anyone who is displeased by such a 
boring approach, Harrison offers a simple re-sponse.

Former Gators swimmer Lily 
Ramirez, 21, was arrested Mon-
day night for cocaine possession and resisting an officer without violence at the Alachua County Fair Grounds.
The drug charge is a third-
degree felony and the latter is a first-degree misdemeanor.
It is Ramirez’s second arrest 
since February, and it cost her any future she had with the Gators’ swimming and diving team.
“We are aware of Lily’s arrest,” 
swimming coach Gregg Troy said in a statement Tuesday. 
“She was attempting to work her way back on to the team as a walk-on this fall after being suspended indefinitely in the spring. 
“One of the most reward-
ing moments as a coach is see-ing your athletes take advantage of their opportunities; it is even more disappointing when they don’t. As of [Tuesday], she will no longer be granted that oppor -
tunity and is not a member of the Florida swimming and diving team.”
According to the police report, 
Ramirez was witnessed hitting another female in the face Mon-day night at the Alachua County Fair Grounds, where a DJ Tiësto concert was being held.
After the victim told officer 
Michael Rodenwoldt that she 
did not want to 
pursue criminal charges against Ramirez, the of-ficer escorted Ramirez to the event gate to be removed.
W h e n 
Rodenwoldt attempted to iden-tify Ramirez, she ran and Roden-woldt chased after her by foot before Ramirez tripped and was detained.
According to the report, after 
Ramirez was detained, a search of her purse discovered a small plastic bag containing a “white powdery substance.”
The substance tested positive 
for cocaine following a field test administered by the officer.
Ramirez refused to give the of-
ficer her name and provided sev-eral false ones to the officer. She eventually said she would give Rodenwoldt her real name if he did not take her to jail.
According to the police report, 
Ramirez finally provided her ac-tual name upon arriving at the jail.
If convicted for the cocaine 
charge, Ramirez could face a maximum of five years in prison.Ramirez has been arrested 
twice in the last  eight months. 
In early February, Ramirez 
and former Florida swimmer Daniela Victoria were detained for shoplifting at the Florida Mall in Orlando, where they were caught attempting to steal a pair of $130 jackets. 
Both UF swimmers were sus-
pended indefinitely from the team and were charged with mis-demeanor petit theft of $100 or more.
Ramirez, a senior, earned All-
America honors as a freshman at the 2009 NCAA Championships as a member of the 200-yard free-style relay team, which finished ninth at the competition.

Swimmer arrested Monday on cocaine possession charge 
� HE HELD MULTIPLE SEC OFFERS.

Alligator Writer
Austin Hardin is 5-foot-11, 200 pounds, 
squats twice that weight and maxed out 
benching 290 pounds last year. He said his 40-yard dash clocks in at 4.4 seconds. He reg-ularly takes snaps for Atlanta Marist High as a corner, a strong safety or, depending on the sugar content of his coach’s breakfast ce-real, a halfback.
And he’s rated the nation’s No. 9 kicker 
by Rivals.com.
“I guess I’m not your typical kicker,” said 
Hardin, a Florida oral commit.
Hardin, who will be in Gainesville for the 
Alabama game this weekend, was hardly noticed before his junior year, as he warmed the bench behind Justin Moore, who is now at Georgia Tech. Then, Hardin kicked a text-book, arching field goal from 59 yards out against rival Decatur (Ga.) Southwest DeKa-lb last fall.
“They wouldn’t send the kicker out to try 
this, would they?” a GPBSports announcer inquired during the locally broadcast game. “Nah, it’s too far for a field goal,” the other booth man said.
Marist won, 17-14, fans stormed the field, 
and Hardin was soon swarmed with invita-tions to universities across the country. 
He began prioritizing which schools he 
would visit in the spring. Florida was at the top of his list, although not first on the schedule.
“That was the one camp that we had real-
ly marked off, like, ‘OK, this is the one camp we’re going to,’ even though I had a whole summer filled up with coaches wanting me to come (visit),” he said of UF.
Hardin’s camp season started at Ole 
Miss. In May, Derek Dooley offered him at Tennessee, then Gene Chizik at Auburn. The calendar days narrowed down until Har -
din’s anticipated visit to Florida, followed by a stop at Virginia Tech.
“At Florida, I would’ve been surprised 
if I didn’t pick up the offer,” he said. “Like, (two) other [Southeastern Conference] schools had just offered me, so it was kind of what I was waiting for. So they pulled me out, about the second day of camp, and were like, ‘Alright, let’s cut to the chase: You’re the guy we want.’”
Soon after, he went on an unofficial visit 
to Gainesville and talked with coach Will Muschamp. Hardin never made the Virginia Tech visit. He committed to UF on the spot.In Marist practice, Hardin does the things 
all the big boys do — he hits, he sprints, he scrimmages. Most high school kickers stick around for about 20 minutes of practice, like Hardin’s little brother, Luke, who kicks for another Atlanta school. Hardin thus has ar -
guably the least-fresh — yet the best — legs in high school football, which presents a separate challenge to take on at Florida.
“I’m kind of excited to see what it’ll be 
like to just be a kicker,” he said. “But at the same time it’s kind of sad because I really do like hitting and tackling and stuff. On kickoffs, when I’m not hitting it in the end zone, I’ll probably be running downfield for tackles.”
Most would think that kickers don’t pose 
a tackling threat. But then again, Hardin has never been a typical kicker.
Oral commitments are non-binding until 
a national letter of intent is signed on or after National Signing Day on Feb. 1, 2012.

Is it too early to consider Gators running back Chris Rainey a candidate for the Heisman Trophy?UF swimmer Lily Ramirez was arrested Monday at the DJ Tiësto concert on multiple charges, including cocaine possession.  See Story, Page 15.
By GREG LUCA 
Alligator Staff Writer
When the Gators study the 
Crimson Tide on film, all they see 
are nameless, faceless numbers. 
The 5-foot-11, 224-pound 
Heisman candidate at running back plowing over, around and through defenses isn’t Trent Rich-ardson. He’s No. 3. The 6-foot-4, 260-pound monster who leads the Crimson Tide with 25 tack-les is No. 30 rather than Dont’a Hightower. 
And the team with a No. 3 
national ranking that will invade The Swamp on Saturday isn’t Al-abama. It’s just another team. 
Since Florida’s 48-10 win 
at Kentucky on Saturday, the phrase “nameless, faceless” has been uttered by UF players seven times. 
The simple expression has 
become a motto that sophomore center Jonotthan Harrison said coach Will Muschamp has used in every meeting. 
It is a constant reminder that 
the Gators need to treat each week the same. To be more fo-cused, more excited or simply better against teams like Alabama would mean Florida wasn’t at its best versus its other opponents. 
“That’s just how we approach 
every team,” Harrison said. “It keeps us focused on the assign-ments and the football concepts in general.”
Indeed, the Gators have 
stressed the need to stay “focused on Florida,” something Harrison and Muschamp said was critical. 
“We don’t worry about no-
body else; we worry about Flor -
ida,” sophomore Ronald Powell said. 
Powell added that the Gators 
need to “do exactly what we do every week,” matching the senti-ment of teammates Jaye Howard, Matt Elam and Dominique Eas-ley, who all said Florida needs to “prepare the same.”Indeed, eight different play-
ers provided 12 variations of, “It’s just like any other game,” or “Just like every other week.”
Only Trey Burton, John Brant-ley and Matt Elam have strayed slightly from the norm, acknowl-edging the significance of the

Florida center Jonotthan Harrison, like many players this week, said the Gators are approaching 
the game against Alabama just like any other. “Nameless, faceless” opponents, he said. 
Gators remain focused on preparation, not Tide
Does the 2011 season hinge on this week’s Alabama game?
Tyler: The Gators have not proven much 
yet. Yes, Florida is 4-0 and looked great last week against Kentucky. Florida 
started 4-0 last year, including a dominating win against Kentucky. Then, they played Ala-bama. Then, the season spiraled out of con-trol.
Still, Florida’s season does not hinge on 
Saturday’s game. This year’s team is differ -
ent from last year’s if, for no other reason, 
the Gators have a new coaching staff. 
After last year’s 31-6 whooping at the hands 
of Alabama, there was no reason to think 
Florida could improve. The players knew Ur -
ban Meyer’s system. This year, however, the Gators should get better as the sea-son progresses, as they grow more familiar with Will Muschamp’s de-fense and Char -
lie Weis’ offense.  
If Saturday’s game goes south, don’t throw the towel in just yet.
Matt: While the season may not hinge 
entirely on Saturday’s game, it’s go-ing to mean a lot more than you think.  
Players, fans and even some sports writers are starting to buy in to these Muschamp-led Gators. This is their chance to prove that all the hype and all the work in the offseason meant something. A blowout loss at home to Alabama — which is in play — sinks the ship before it can offi-cially set sail. 
This team is full of young, impression-
able players who, for as much as they toe the company line in interviews, are an emotional bunch. 
Losing at home in The Swamp to Alabama 
would start the murderous October schedule off on the wrong foot and potentially set the table for four straight losses. 
Tyler: Of course this is a young team, but 
that doesn’t mean one loss will warp their minds. They have all played sports most of their lives. They know how to bounce back from losses.
Falling to Alabama will hurt, but this is a 
team that should continue to improve as the season goes on. Every year, the Gators’ No. 1 goal is to get to Atlanta. This Saturday’s game won’t make or break their journey.
Don’t be surprised to see Florida drop 
games against Southeastern Conference West TOM GREEN
Alligator Staff Writer
Gators center Jonotthan Harri-
son believes this week’s matchup 
with No. 3 Alabama will be all about the battle at the line of scrim-mage.
And he has no doubts No. 12 
Florida will find success running the ball come Saturday.
“We will get the run,” Harrison 
said Tuesday. “We will get the run. It starts with the offensive line, and 
that’s the po-sition I play, and I have confidence 
in my unit.”
When asked if he was making 
a guarantee, Harrison wouldn’t take it that far, simply responding that he is confident in his position group.
Considering the numbers, it’s 
understandable that Harrison feels sure about Florida’s ability to run against Alabama. The Gators cur -
rently tout the top rushing offense in the Southeastern Conference and rank 10th in the nation with 259 yards per contest on the ground. 
Florida also averages nearly 6 
yards per carry behind its close-knit offensive line and a running back corps led by speedsters Chris Run game 
will be key Saturday
