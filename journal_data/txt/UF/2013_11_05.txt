Authorities evacuated patrons 
and pets from the Butler Plaza Best 
Buy and PetSmart stores Monday afternoon after rooftop solar panels caught ﬁ  re.
Gainesville Fire Rescue respond-
ed to reports of a ﬁ  re just after 2 p.m., said Incident Commander Pat Lewis. Emergency personnel from GFR, Alachua County Fire Rescue and Gainesville Police arrived a few minutes later, and the ﬁ  re was hosed out by 2:19 p.m.
No humans or animals were in-
jured in the ﬁ  re. 
Lewis said the scene was ﬁ  lled 
with “heavy smoke and ﬂ  ames.” About 60 of the solar panels on a Best Buy storage facility roof caught ﬁ  re, he said, but the cause is still un-der investigation.
Best Buy incurred minor water 
damage from the hose water leaking inside, but no other damages were reported at the time, he said. 
Customers and employees were 
let back inside the store just after 3 p.m. 
“We did two hours with zero 
revenue, so I have to make sure we stay as busy as possible,” said Brenda Banales, a store manager. She declined to comment further and referred reporters to Best Buy’s corporate ofﬁ  ces. 
While waiting for the stores to re-
open, one bystander joked the inci-dent could be good for business.
“Come to Gainesville,” he said. 
“We have the hottest deals.”

“Explosion!” 
UF dance professor Tzveta Kassabova 
yelled at engineering students wearing gym shorts and T-shirts. They responded by throwing their arms out, going limp and fall-ing to the ﬂ  oor of the dance studio.
Among those exploding was Stephanie 
Bagiardi, a 23-year-old UF industrial and sys-tems engineering senior. But a dance studio is the last place she thought she would be while studying engineering. 
The design capstone in the College of En-
gineering is structured the same every semes-ter: Students are challenged to take a problem presented from a company and develop a more efﬁ  cient or cheaper product than what they were given. 
But for the ﬁ  rst time, students are required 
to create an interpretive dance to go along with their ﬁ  nal projects.
At the beginning of the semester, Bagiardi’s 
design class was given ﬁ  ve words and was told to portray them through dance moves.
“Those have been very interesting,” she 
said. “Watching engineers dance is a fun thing.”
On Wednesday at 4 p.m., the class will 
perform in select locations throughout the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art. The dances range from four to 10 minutes long.
“We’re like the guinea pig class for this,” 
Bagiardi said.
Her group built a curriculum planning 
website that runs an algorithm to create a recommended college graduation plan. They will be performing an interpretive dance based on their project to an instrumental ver-sion of “Square One” by Coldplay. UF engineers dance with designsIt is under investigation
� RATE INCREASES TOOK 
EFFECT OCT. 1.
HANNA MARCUS

Some apartment-dwellers say they 
are starting to see changes in their 
monthly bills due to Gainesville Region-al Utilities rate increases, but GRU attri-butes higher bills to customer usage. 
The addition of the biomass plant, 
a new renewable generation source in Gainesville, is the primary cause of the rate increases that took effect Oct. 1.
Stephen Capsanes, a 21-year-old UF 
industrial engineering junior, said he and his roommates had to pay about $10 more for utilities than the previous month, although their utility usage had not changed.
Capsanes said he doesn’t agree that 
residents, especially students, should have to pay the increased rate.
“We have enough expenses already 
with classes and rent itself,” he said.
But a GRU spokeswoman, Kendall 
Litton Jensen, said apartment residents shouldn’t have seen a difference yet, and in fact, because of a lower fuel ad-justment rate, gas and electric charges were lower this year for the month of October and November. 
“Customers, like apartment resi-
dents, haven’t actually seen any impacts Spike in utility bills not due 
to rate increase, GRU says

Sweetwater Organic Coffee Com-
pany recently added pedal power.
A utility bike equipped with a 
small trailer began making deliver-
ies last week for the fair-trade coffee roaster, located at 1331 S. Main St.
Since then, it’s been making its 
way to local businesses and to the farmers market. During Fest 12, the trailer was downtown providing samples of Sweetwater’s custom ALL Blend, inspired by a punk band playing the festival.
“It’ll be all around town,” said 
Mike Weaver, a production man-ager of Sweetwater Coffee, which creates custom blends and sells wholesale and exclusively certiﬁ  ed organic coffee.Joe Ergle, the company’s 24-year-
old bike delivery rider, rides out of Sweetwater Coffee on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make the deliveries.
The ﬁ  rst 248-pound delivery on 
Oct. 29 included stops to downtown corner store Pop a Top, Harvest Thyme, Sweetwater Branch Inn and UF campus. Ergle made a second trip to haul a large order for Ward’s Supermarket.He said he put campus last on 
the route because he needs a light load to maneuver in the high pedes-trian trafﬁ  c.
Sweetwater Coffee collaborated 
with Kanner Karts Bicycle Trailers to source trailers for the delivery service, Weaver said.
Steven Kanner, who started the 
trailer-manufacturing company in August 2012, built a custom trailer for Sweetwater Coffee with signs installed on the side and a rear hitch that will allow additional trailers.
“My biggest passion is utilitar-
ian cycling — showing people that a bike can be used for more than car-rying people,” Kanner said.
He said he’s excited to see how 
the trailer works for the coffee com-pany and hopes it inspires other businesses to do something similar.

Despite Alabama decision, no worries for block seating at UF
� THE LAST TIME THE TICKET OFFICE 
THREATENED TO REVOKE SEATING WAS ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO. 
STEVEN KATONA
Alligator Staff Writer skatona@alligator.org
Students who get their football tickets in 
block seating at UF can breathe a little easier. 
Privileges will not be taken away for leaving a football game early. 
UF has no intention of mirroring the 
University of Alabama, which recently sus-pended 20 of its 36 block sections for “exces-sive tardiness or early departure from the stadium.”
Mike Hill, executive associate athletics di-
rector for external affairs, said there are no plans or discussions at all about taking block seating away from UF students, including the larger Greek-life blocks, for leaving early.
“That’s how it should be,” said Jackson 
Crumit, a 21-year-old UF accounting sopho-more, who is the ticket chairman for fraterni-ty Sigma Chi. “It’s our decision to leave early 
because we are paying to go to the games.”
Students who belong to organizations at 
Alabama, mostly fraternities and sororities, 
that hold tickets to pre-designated sections in the stadium will still be allowed to attend games, but they’ll have to ﬁ  nd another place to sit. 
Travis Leyndyke, who was promoted to 
director of ticket operations at UF two weeks ago, said UF doesn’t really track people leav-
ing early. 
“I guess it could be possible by looking 
because we know where their seats are, but 
we don’t have any policies to where it’ll be taken away,” he said. 
The only reason block seating gets taken 
away now is if there are issues during a game, Leyndyke said. 
The last time the ticket ofﬁ  ce threatened 
to revoke block seating was about three years ago. Some blocks were “screaming vulgar things toward the opposing fans,” Leyndyke said.
“That’s how it should be. It’s our 
decision to leave early because we 
are paying to go to the games.”

Former Gov. Charlie Crist offi-
cially announced his candidacy in 
the upcoming 2014 gubernatorial election in St. Petersburg on Mon-day. 
Except this time, he’s running as 
a Democrat.
Crist will compete with Nan 
Rich in the Democratic primary with other candidates. Rich was a state senator until 2012 when term limits forced her to retire from the senate.  Crist served as the Republican 
governor of Florida from 2007 to 2011, after which he endorsed Presi-dent Barack Obama for re-election in 2012. Months later, Crist changed affiliation from independent to the Democratic Party.
After an unsuccessful run as an 
independent for the U.S. Senate in 2010, Crist said he was running again to take back the state from in-cumbent candidate Gov. Rick Scott.
“We are a state that embraces 
outsiders, even outsiders like Rick Scott,” Crist said in a speech Mon-day. “We deserve a governor who believes all Floridians deserve a voice, not just those who agree with him, or who can write the biggest check.”
UF political 
science and sus-tainability studies senior Maria Mar-tinez met Crist at the 2013 Florida Democratic State Party Conference in Orlando last month.
Martinez, 20, and Crist discussed 
the importance of environmental is-sues as well as LGBT equality and immigration.“He was obviously gauging sup-
port and trying to see what issues mattered most to Floridians for the upcoming elections,” she said.
Martinez said she couldn’t say if 
she supported the former governor in his past elections, however she will most likely campaign for him in the upcoming race.
“I do feel like I share more ideo-
logical views with him now than back then,” she said.
UF College Republicans spokes-
man Michael Christ said Scott’s re-cord compares favorably to Crist’s record, citing how unemployment has decreased and job creation has improved since Scott became gover-nor after Crist.He said UF College Republicans 
will support Scott for re-election.
“You clearly saw someone who 
was more concerned about his per-sonal career and his own political ambitions than the state,” the 20-year-old political science junior said. “He’s about to run out of parties.”
Although history and economics 
senior Josh Cole might not vote in the upcoming election, the UF Lib-ertarians president said Crist seems to be somewhat libertarian on social and economic issues.
“Combining those two could 
make a powerful candidate who has hopefully recognized that economic restrictions hurt the most vulnerable among us,” the 21-year-old said.

With the passing of a law 
requiring some restaurants to 
display the caloric information of their food products, a UF survey shows most adults still do not know how many calo-ries they actually need.
The menu labeling law is 
part of the Affordable Care Act, said Lauren Headrick, lead au-thor of a paper about the sur-vey. 
The law requires restaurants 
with 20 or more chains or 20 or more vending machines to show the calories in each item on their menus.
“We wanted to gauge 
whether or not the info on the menu would be useful,” Head-rick said.
The UF survey of 978 people 
of varying height and weight found adults overwhelmingly underestimated the amount of calories they need daily to maintain their current weight.
“What we hypothesized was 
that obese individuals would overestimate their calorie needs the most,” said Michelle Zitt, a UF nutritional sciences doctor-ate student who conducted the survey with three other stu-dents. “We found just the op-posite.”
She said people who diet 
underestimated their caloric needs even more because of the focus on calorie counting, which overlooks other impor-tant aspects of nutrition.Researchers were surprised 
to find that health professionals and students in health-related majors were no more educated on their caloric needs than oth-er adults.
“Across the board, people 
underestimated their energy requirement,” Headrick said.
Zitt blamed diet culture and 
a lack of nutritional education for adults misunderstanding their nutritional needs.
“It’s not that we think that 
labeling on the menus is a bad idea,” she said. “We just think it’s important to educate people so they can use that and the menu labeling to make deci-sions.”
Adults underestimate 
calorie counts
Students are also taking classes in cartoon, drawing to enhance skills 
The engineering students were put into nine groups this 
semester and were teamed up with dancers from the College 
of Fine Arts. With the techniques they learned from the dance classes, each team was tasked with explaining their product through dance choreography using the dancers.
“The idea is to cross-pollinate and see how we learn from each other,” said Elif Akcali, an industrial and systems en-gineering associate professor, who is heading this new por-tion of the course made possible by a grant given from the provost’s office.Andrew Daw, a 21-year-old UF industrial and systems 
engineering senior, said he is looking forward to taking the class in Spring 2015 because the course helps engineering students not take things so seriously. 
Additionally, design students are also taking classes in 
cartoon and drawing to enhance their storytelling skills.  
“We all have analytical minds and are black and white 
when it comes to things,” Bagiardi said, “so this is trying to get us to think in that gray area of being creative.” dAncE , from page 1Electric bills cheaper than in Fall 2012
at this point,” she said. “They’ll probably start seeing it 
in their December billing.”
For October 2012, the total cost of 1,000 kilowatt 
hours of electricity was $127.67. As of October 2013, the rate was $124.15 — about $3 cheaper, she said. 
Litton Jensen said water rates have already in-
creased 10 cents, but she said the higher utility charges residents are seeing could simply be usage issues.
“The water charge did go up a little bit, but each 
apartment complex is structured differently in how they handle their utilities, so it’s hard to make the ge-neric conclusion that (increased water rates) will apply to everyone,” she said. Litton Jensen said some apart-
ment complexes have begun email-ing residents informing them their bills would go up because of the in-crease. But utilities caps most likely won’t change.  
A manager for one local apart-
ment complex acknowledged she is affected by the issue but could not 
comment at corporate management’s request.
Wendy Roth, a 22-year-old UF nursing junior, said 
the bill decrease from September to October was true for her. She would be disappointed if she noticed a fu-ture climb in her utility rates.
“If I started to see a significant increase in my bill, it 
would really suck,” she said. GRu , from page 1

A truck arrived on the Plaza 
of the Americas on Monday of-
fering to pay students $1 to watch a four-minute video for animal rights.
UF is the most recent stop on 
the year-and-a-half-long “10 Bil-lion Lives” tour, said Stephanie Frankle, a 26-year-old tour as-sistant for Farm Animal Rights Movement, the program behind the campaign. “We drive this truck all over 
the country, mainly to college campuses, music fests, any-where with a lot of people,” she said. The truck spends several hundred dollars per stop and is all donation-run. A normal day typically costs about $300, Fran-kle said. 
The mission of the campaign, 
Frankle said, is to encourage students to cut back on meat or to more seriously consider a vegetarian or vegan diet.The four-minute video shows 
images of large-scale factory farming and animal slaughter that some students call “intense” and “graphic.”
However, Asami Hayashi, 
a 21-year-old UF linguistics se-nior, said she didn’t feel forced to watch the video or that there was undue pressure to convert to a meat-free lifestyle.
“It was a little uncomfortable 
to watch,” she said. “I recently learned about it in my nutrition class, so it was very relevant to me. I was kind of curious to see it anyway.”

� FUNDRAISING ENDS 
THURSDAY. 
MARIA LLORENS

It’s hard to make the older 
format of radio play nicely with 
the Internet, but inside a studio downtown, a group of music lov-ers is trying to make it happen.
Grow Radio, a local Internet 
radio station that broadcasts 
from Gainesville, offers an eclec-tic mix of music featuring local disc jockeys. 
The station joined many other 
independent businesses in Sep-tember by going online to ask for needed funds to continue its op-erations. Of the $25,000 it needs to pay bills and buy supplies, the station has made $5,425. Fund-raising ends Thursday night.
Unlike Kickstarter, Indiegogo 
gives campaigns the option of keeping donations even if the goal isn’t met.
“Without the money to keep 
the power on, we can’t broad-cast,” said Jeremy Murdock, a Grow Radio DJ.
General manager Bill Bryson 
created the online fundraising campaign page on Indiegogo at goo.gl/JNd6L7. After relying on a handful of donors for years, he decided the station needed to ask more of its listeners to contribute to rising costs. The station is in need of better technology and maintenance.
Bryson created Grow Radio in 
2009 with a group of friends who thought Gainesville lacked an al-ternative radio station.
“Nobody was playing any 
music that we liked,” he said.
Indiegogo also requires cam-
paigns provide tiered rewards, or perks, to donors. So Grow Ra-dio collaborated with local busi-nesses to offer guided tree climbs, welding lessons, passes to Fest, a subscription to Vice magazine and other items like T-shirts.
If the station doesn’t meet its 
goal, Bryson intends to explore other options. He plans to sell merchandise and ask for dona-tions year-round on the station’s website.
Bryson said Internet stations 
like Grow Radio struggle to at-tract attention because it’s com-peting with FM radio stations. Using Internet stations can re-quire connecting a phone to car speakers, and he said most listen-ers prefer the passive experience of simply ﬂ  ipping on an FM sta-tion.
“That’s all it takes to discour-
age some people,” he said.
Some listeners, like 22-year-
old UF alumnus Joseph Villavi-cencio, think it’s worth the effort. 
Grow Radio plays music peo-
ple may have trouble ﬁ  nding on their own, he said.
DJ Leela Corman plays most-
ly Middle Eastern music on her show. Her goal is to expand the ears and minds of her listeners beyond auto-tuned pop robots, she said.
“Great radio serves the com-
munity it’s in,” Corman said. “This is something so valuable.”Grow Radio $20K

On eliminating 
bathroom attendants
You know what low-wage restaurant workers in Man-
hattan love? Being told by “Business Insider” writers that their job position should be eliminated. 
Last week, “Business Insider” editor Henry Blodget wrote 
a whiny article about the bathroom attendant service offered at Balthazar, a brasserie restaurant in New York City. He didn’t complain about the quality of service; rather, he called it “extortion-by-guilt.” Basically, he didn’t particularly feel like tipping the dude a dollar for turning on the sink. 
At the end of the article, he wrote, “So I am hereby appeal-
ing not just to the bosses at Balthazar, but to restaurateurs and hoteliers all over the world, to eliminate this service.”
The owners of Balthazar responded by doing just that. As an update to the article, Blodget posted, “Good news! 
The boss at Balthazar, Keith McNally, apparently agrees with me and also doesn’t like the bathroom attendant service he has asked his employees to provide. Hopefully, as he phases it out, he will reassign the talented employees who provide it to the dining room.”
Take a careful look at that language. Blodget doesn’t know 
that the bathroom attendants will be reassigned. After all, the skill sets required by a bathroom attendant and a server or busboy are different, and he’s naive to think that a restaurant owner will bother to train new workers. 
Nope; the most likely scenario involves some newly un-
employed workers in one of the most expensive cities in the U.S.
The whole situation is just icky. In a section of the article, 
Blodget complains that he doesn’t need someone to turn on his water for him and writes, “Thanks, but I actually don’t need someone to turn on the water for me. First of all, it wastes water. Second, it makes me feel like I’m the kind of guy who dreams of being rich enough to be able to pay some-one to turn on the water for me.”
Look, dude, I hate to break it to you, but you’re already 
eating breakfast at a place that boasts a $20 French toast plate. But, as they say, the squeaky wheel gets the grease, and thanks to one pretentious writer who doesn’t have a back-ground in restaurant management, some innocent workers are out of a job. 
The article is absurdly long. Like, this guy actually took 
time out of his day to write an opinion article for a huge pub-lication about a service that minorly inconveniences him — real hard-hitting journalism. It’s easy for Blodget, however; while he gets to continue chowing down on $22 eggs Benedict and writing crap articles, real people are out of a job. 
To top it off, Blodget took to Twitter to try to explain him-
self. The people of Twitter didn’t disappoint, however.

there will be a wine shortage? Today’s question: Do you count calories?
How do we deﬁ  ne ‘revolution’ in 2013?
What does revolution mean in today’s complex 
world?
The Occupy movement sparked a ﬂ  ame of rev-
olution across the world in 2011. The Arab Spring and this year’s mass manifestations against government corruption in Turkey and Brazil prove that anarchy on the streets still exists and moves millions.
But as the world develops and technology advances, op-
pression becomes less tangible. 
An analysis by the Guardian published last week ex-
plains how the National Security Agency has been collect-ing data — methods and scope reaching far beyond what was once proportioned to the defense organization. 
The article explains the revelations that Edward Snowden 
made earlier this year. The former NSA employee has been both lauded as a heroic whistleblower and condemned as a treacherous spy. 
But one thing Snowden did do is bring the NSA to our 
attention — again. 
In 1978, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) 
was passed to prevent the NSA from overstepping bound-aries, especially because of the Americans who fell under their scrutiny: anti-war protesters, union leaders and civil rights activists. 
Until 2008 when that act was amended, the NSA could 
only watch out for foreign suspects if it thought it was nec-essary to investigate. Since 9/11, fear of terrorism has urged Congress to give the NSA some more leg room. 
In 2012, the amendment was renewed, allowing the NSA 
to watch virtually anyone. 
Telecommunication and Internet companies have ad-
mitted to complying with NSA requests for user data and even weakened their own encryption services, according to the documents Snowden revealed.
We might not have anything to hide from the govern-
ment, but it doesn’t mean our most intimate communica-tions should be on display for a small group of people with unlimited access. That’s bordering totalitarianism.
Now, for all this talk of anarchy, I have to admit I believe 
a free society needs law and order to function. The supreme law of the land is the U.S. Consti-tution. Modern society is compli-cated by abstract ideas our forefa-thers could never have imagined in 1787. What could James Madi-son know about tweets or source codes or IP addresses?
However, the document can 
help us realize how the govern-ment has gone too far and per-
haps how we can loosen that invisible hand’s grip. 
The Fourth Amendment of the constitution states “the 
right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and sei-zures.” 
There’s no doubt the NSA has violated the supreme law 
of the land by searching and seizing our information on our virtual property. While the purpose of surveillance is to be a tool of defense, the collection of phone and email records is a serious infringement of that right to reasonable privacy.
Another amendment in the Bill of Rights was created 
to provide U.S. citizens with a way of self-defense and resistance to oppression. The right to keep and bear arms was once about letting Revolutionary-era Americans own weapons so they could rise up against a potentially corrupt system. 
But we can also inform ourselves through the work of 
whistleblowers and “hacktivists,” like Snowden, or the hacker organization, Anonymous. The decentralized group has called for millions to march today. Its mission statement calls for a reformation of the infrastructure of the govern-ment, “to remind this world what it has forgotten, That fair-ness, justice, and freedom are more than just words.”
In 2013, owning a handgun and a militia mentality won’t 
protect you against the government’s invasion of privacy. 
But we can arm ourselves with the same thing the gov-
ernment is using to assess and control the public: informa-tion.

With former Republican and former Florida Gov. 
Charlie Crist announcing his gubernatorial can-didacy on Monday, all eyes will eventually rest 
on our state in 2014. He will most likely be the Democratic challenger to face off against current Gov. Rick Scott. The main question that will be asked is, “Can the turncoat win back his ofﬁ  ce?”
Florida is a purple state. Con-
servative Sen. Marco Rubio and liberal Sen. Bill Nelson represent the state in the Senate, and 17 Re-publicans and 10 Democrats serve in the House of Representatives. The state is led by Scott with a Republican legislature. President Barack Obama carried the state in the 2012 and 2008 presidential elections. If there is a state in which a former governor who declared no party afﬁ  liation to run for the Senate and then switched his party yet again to run for governor’s ofﬁ  ce should be, Florida is deﬁ  nitely it. 
But the question still remains: Can Crist win?  Democrats will vote for their guy, period. Their guy pre-
sumably will be Crist, due to his high proﬁ  le and previ-ous political experience. His status as a former Republican probably won’t bother them.
But will Republicans vote for him?It is important to take two things into consideration: his 
tenure during his time as governor and his 2010 race for the Senate. 
During his tenure in Tallahassee, Crist vetoed a bill that 
would ban taxpayer-funded abortions, and he supported environmental policy that opposed offshore drilling. These are no-nos in the current state of the Republican Party. He also nominated judges and justices who varied in their po-litical ideology. Crist was a moderate to left-leaning Repub-lican governor.  
In 2010, he challenged former state House Speaker Mar-
co Rubio for Florida’s vacated Senate seat. Even though Rubio has taken ﬂ  ak during the immigration debate not too long ago, he is still a popular, high-proﬁ  le Republican. Many Republicans are still upset the moderate Republican Crist challenged Rubio for the seat.
History shows more Republicans than Democrats turn 
out to vote in non-presidential elections. Right-leaning in-dependents and Republicans will make the difference in this election. They will decide if they want four more years of Crist at the helm or if his party change will affect their vote. 
I propose that Crist will win the Democratic primary but 
lose to Scott in the general election. 
But why? Demographics are shifting in the state and 
Florida voted for Obama in the last election. 
Here are my reasons: First of all, Florida is a pretty right-wing state. The state 
is pro-gun and pro-life, among other right-wing policy po-sitions. Many municipalities — Miami, Orlando and Tam-pa to name a few — do have a large amounts of Democrats. However, the state has a stronger rural population that supports Republicans and will turn out for the election.    
Second of all, Florida voted for Obama 50 to 49 last year. 
That was a high-proﬁ  le, high-stakes presidential election. Everybody who was likely to vote did just that — they vot-ed. It was not a landslide victory for Obama in Florida. As previously stated, off-year elections favor Republicans and tend to have lower voter turnouts. 
Third, the most galvanized group in the state — and the 
country, for that matter — is the right-wing populists. They do not like Crist, did not support him in the Senate race and will not support his changed “political views.” They argu-ably have the strongest get-out-to-vote efforts and will mo-bilize supporters. Even though they may not support some of Scott’s policies, they will certainly unite to defeat Crist. 
Even though this prediction is like picking a football 
team to win the Super Bowl before the season even starts, it is important to realize that Florida will be in the national political spotlight for 2014. If history tells us anything, we have a lot to worry about.
This election will be divisive, dirty and will attract a lot 
of super PACs. Here’s to looking forward to the madness.

opinions@alligator.orgAs a recreational activity, reading is a 
rewarding source of personal enjoy-ment, relaxation, stress relief and in-
tellectual probing. 
This is because it trains the mind’s atten-
tion span, strengthens one’s ability to discern 
implicit and subtle meanings, allows people to learn, exposes us to diverse topics and varied opinions and improves one’s reading ability. This ﬁ  nal point, despite appearing as a circular argument, is valid. Continually improving reading skills can create a virtuous, self-rein-forcing cycle. As one reads more, one reads better. 
Reading has some clear advantages over other popu-
lar recreational activities. Books are light and portable 
and require no maintenance aside from normal care. By using the library and by borrowing books from others, books can be obtained for little to no money. They pro-vide many hours of use, with none of the neg-atives associated with the use of electronics, such as the use, waste and cost of electricity or the monetary cost of tech products.
No matter what your major or discipline, 
reading will help strengthen the skills you 
need, be they logic-based, creative, memorization or in-formation retention. Reading makes you a better prob-lem solver by enabling you to think through situations encountered in books or predict the parts you haven’t read yet. By testing your reading level with either a greater difﬁ  culty of material or an unfamiliar subject, you can practice a higher work ethic and improve your ability to persevere through a challenge.
Don’t worry about the opportunity cost; by spending 
time reading, valuable time has been used, not wasted.

ter. A version of this column originally appeared on UWire. Reading is worth the time investmentUWire

Big butts make for big brains.
According to a recent University 
of Oxford study, women with bigger butts were found to be more intelli-gent.
UF ﬁ  nance sophomore Annie Bry-
an considers herself living proof. The 19-year-old has 3.8 grade point aver-age and also considers her butt to be her best asset. But she isn’t fully con-vinced her grades have anything to do with her nice behind.
“I think my butt has more to do 
with my exercise routine than my grade point average,” she said.
The study linked big butts in fe-
males to intelligence due to the ome-ga-3 fats that are connected to brain development. The study also said big butts are connected to lower risks for heart problems and diabetes.
Dr. Hal Brodsky of Gainesville 
Family Physicians said he is unfamil-iar with the study, but there has been evidence for a decade in the ﬁ  eld of di-abetes research that fat in the butt and thighs isn’t necessarily unhealthy. 
“Fat in the butt and thighs produc-
es healthy cholesterol,” he said. “Peo-ple with fat in the stomach area tend to have more health problems.”
Brodsky said pear-shaped people, 
who generally have small waists and larger butts and thighs, can still be healthy even if their body mass index is higher than average.
Still, “I don’t think Kim Kardashian 
is getting any smarter with time,” he said.

Much like the rest of the nation, Florida’s consumer con-
ﬁ  dence in the economy faltered in October.
In light of a 16-day partial government shutdown and 
other economic woes, consumer conﬁ  dence — how people 
felt about their income and the overall economy —  plunged to an index level of 71, down seven points from September and reaching its lowest level in almost two years, according to a UF survey.
The index has not dropped this low since December 2011, 
following the last debt ceiling showdown in August of that year, said Chris McCarty, survey director of UF’s Survey Re-search Center. 
McCarty said conﬁ  dence among Floridians was already 
declining prior to the shutdown and debt ceiling debate.
This pessimism is partly due to higher-than-average un-
employment rates for young age groups, he said.
“It’s particularly those folks in their early 20s that are re-
ally taking it to the chin,” he said.
Lidisis Machin, a 20-year-old UF ﬁ  nance junior, said the 
drop in consumer conﬁ  dence is justiﬁ  ed. 
“It’s hard to be optimistic about the future when the gov-
ernment is acting so childish,” she said.
The heaviest blow was to people’s perceptions about 
whether it’s a good time to buy a big-ticket item, like a car or house, declining 11 points to 80, according to the survey.
Consumers were also more pessimistic about individual 
ﬁ  nancial state and expectations for business conditions in the next year.  
Despite this growing decline in consumer conﬁ  dence of 
the economy, 21-year-old UF entomology and nematology senior C.R. Lewis said he still has high expectations for the country’s government and economic future. 
“I think the U.S. economy is going to keep growing, 
no matter what. We have a strong economic base, and the American people have a lot of ingenuity,” he said. “So I’m very optimistic in that.”Shutdown

Alligator Staff Writer @LandonWatnick
Kasey Hill’s debut with the Gators got 
off to an erratic start Friday night in the 
O’Connell Center.
With 11:23 remaining in the first half, the 
freshman point guard dribbled the ball up the floor and slowly studied his options in the halfcourt. 
To his right, Hill saw Casey Prather on the 
wing.
Then, Hill hesitated.After a few seconds of contemplation, 
Hill attempted to dish the ball to Prather, but Florida Southern guard Dominic Lane tipped and stole the errant pass. 
Fewer than three minutes later, Hill made 
another mental error. 
After Lane made a three pointer to cut 
UF’s lead to 28-23, Hill raced through the Moccasins’ full-court press and attempted a pass to DeVon Walker. 
But the ball sailed past Walker’s hands 
and bounced by a pack of photographers on the baseline.
“[Coach Billy Donovan told me to] stop 
being so loose with the ball, stuff like that,” Hill said. 
“Don’t be careless. Take every possession 
like it’s your last possession.”
Despite committing two 
early turnovers and missing three of his first five shots, Hill calmed down and went on a tear to close out the first half. 
The Eustis native made 
his next four field-goal at-tempts to end the half with 
14 points on 6-of-9 shooting.
Hill missed all four of his shots in the sec-
ond half but finished No. 10 Florida’s 110-88 exhibition win against Florida Southern with 17 points — the third-best mark on the team. 
The 6-foot-1 McDonald’s All-American 
also recorded three assists against three turn-overs in 26 minutes of action as Florida’s starting point guard.
Five of Hill’s six successful field goals were 
layups, with three coming in transition. 
Hill said he did well attacking in transition 
and getting open shots for his teammates, but admitted the pace of the college game is far � FULWOOD CAUGHT TWO 
PASSES AGAINST GEORGIA.
ADAM PINCUS
Alligator Staff Writer @adamDpincus
Demarcus Robinson and Ah-
mad Fulwood have been grouped 
together since they arrived at Flor-ida. 
They enrolled early and were 
expected to help jump start an of-fense starving for playmakers at the receiver position.
On Saturday, for two plays, it 
looked like a freshman receiver fi-nally fulfilled the promise that fol-lowed him to campus.
It was Fulwood.The Jacksonville native flashed 
his ability by catching two passes for 22 yards against Georgia at Ev-erBank Field on Saturday.
“He’s going to be a good foot-
ball player,” coach Will Muschamp said. “He’s got to continue to play fast and block well on the perime-ter. Did a nice job for us. He’s going 
to be a really good player.”
Fulwood caught 
his first pass on an 11-yard out route in the second quar-ter. His second re-
ception went for 11 yards on a third 
and 20 at the 50-yard line. He now has six receptions for 53 yards this season. 
“He’s starting to get in there and 
get the feel of the game and play to the speed of the game,” offensive JOE MORGAN
Alligator Staff Writer @joe_morgan
Nearly two months ago, Will Muschamp led No. 12 
Florida into Sun Life Stadium as a three-point favorite 
against Miami. Now, the Gators are fighting to avoid both their first postseason without a bowl bid since 1990 and their first losing season since 1979.
“Everybody is real disappointed right now,” defensive 
back Jaylen Watkins said. “We’ve lost three in a row and definitely canceled out our chances in the (Southeastern Conference) East. Now the main goal is to become bowl eligible.”
Numerous injuries to key players such as quarterback 
Jeff Driskel, defensive tackle Dominique Easley and run-ning back Matt Jones have compounded a precipitous de-cline. Florida has already doubled last year’s total in the loss column with at least four games to go.
While the offense — ranked 113th nationally with 334.6 
yards per game — sputters much like it did in 2012, the inexperienced defense has failed to overcome the loss of seven starters from last year’s team. If you count Easley, who played only three games in 2013 before suffering a season-ending ACL tear in September, that number in-creases to eight.
One glaring struggle for the Gators on the defensive side

Riley Cooper celebrates after catching a 63-yard touchdown pass during the 
Philadelphia Eagles’ 49-20 victory against the Oakland Raiders on Sunday.
GATORS IN THE NFL
  LANDON WATNICK
 Alligator Staff Writer @LandonWatnick
With Week 9 of the NFL season in the books, here 
are a few former Gators who made the most tangible 
impact for their respective teams. 
  While Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Nick 
Foles enjoyed a historic game at Oakland on Sunday, one of his receivers, Riley Cooper, was also impressive. 
  Cooper caught three of Foles’ seven touch-
down passes as the Eagles cruised past the Oak-land Raiders 49-20. 
The former Gators receiver was targeted six 
times and caught ﬁ  ve balls from Foles for 139 yards.
  During a three-minute span in the second 
quarter, Cooper scored twice.
  On third and 5 at the Raiders’ 17-yard line, 
Foles dropped back from the line of scrimmage and threw to Cooper in the left corner of the end zone as his receiver beat Oakland rookie cornerback D.J. Hayden — a 2013 ﬁ  rst-round pick — in coverage. 
  Cooper’s second touchdown catch — his 
most dynamic of the afternoon — came with 11:17 remaining in the second quarter. On the play, Foles faked a handoff to LeSean McCoy, scanned the ﬁ  eld and then threw a deep pass to Cooper.
  Foles connected down the ﬁ  eld with the 
fourth-year receiver as Hayden tripped before the catch and was burned in single coverage. 
The play put the Eagles ahead 21-3 prior to 
halftime.
  Cooper tacked on his ﬁ  nal touchdown catch 
of the afternoon — a 5-yard reception — with 4:28 remaining in the third quarter. 
The touchdown pass was Foles’ seventh 
of the day, which made him only the seventh quarterback in NFL history to throw for seven scores in one game.
  Cooper, who came under ﬁ  re during the 
summer after video of him using a racial slur surfaced, has since become one of the Eagles’ most reliable receivers.
  He has now recorded at least 88 receiving 
yards in three of his past four games and has ﬁ  ve touchdowns on the season. 
Notes: During his team’s 30-24 overtime vic-
tory against the San Diego Chargers on Sunday, Washington Redskins tight end Jordan Reed caught four passes for 37 yards. 
His most important catch went for 12 yards 
on third and 8 for a ﬁ  rst down during Wash-ington’s game-winning touchdown drive in overtime.
  Miami Dolphins kicker Caleb Sturgis 
shanked his ﬁ  rst kick from 34 yards out wide left Thursday night during his team’s 22-20 overtime win against the Cincinnati Bengals. 
But the rookie rebounded for the Dolphins, 
making his ﬁ  nal two ﬁ  eld goals — including a 44-yarder that tied the game at 20 and sent it into overtime. 
  Cleveland Browns cornerback Joe Haden re-
corded six tackles and two pass deﬂ  ections dur-ing his team’s 24-18 win against the Baltimore Ravens.
  Following two straight games with 80 receiv-
ing yards, New York Jets wide receiver David Nelson caught just one pass for 19 yards during a 26-20 victory against the New Orleans Saints on Sunday.  Cooper catches three touchdowns  
as Eagles soar against Raidersof the ball is starting slow. Through eight games, 
45.3 percent of the points Florida has given up have come in the first quarter. On Saturday, Georgia added 17 more.
Muschamp said correcting the problem is diffi-
cult because the slow starts result from several dif-ferent issues, ranging from third-down effective-ness to being cut off from gaps.
“We’ve just got to go back and put our guys in 
better situations to play,” Muschamp said. “And that’s on us as coaches. We’ve got to put our guys in better situations to feel more comfortable and re-act as opposed to think in some situations.”
Given the continued ineffectiveness of the of-
fense and the uncharacteristic struggles of the de-fense, Muschamp has faced criticism for failing to match or come close to the results of an 11-2 season that ended with a Sugar Bowl berth in New Or-leans.
The Gators have even failed to match the ex-
pected drop-off predicted by media members dur-ing SEC Media Days in July. 
Florida was picked to finish third — behind 
Georgia and South Carolina. Only 19 media mem-bers in Hoover, Ala., selected UF to win the Eastern Division.
But in last week’s AP Poll, only 14 media mem-
bers deemed the Gators worthy of a ranking. This week, Florida failed to receive any AP Poll votes for the first time since the 7-6 Gators were left out of the final rankings in 2011.
“We expected to have a 
much better record this time of year, but we haven’t played that way,” quarterback Tyler 
Murphy said. “It’s just unfortunate.”
Florida’s players say Muschamp’s support has 
helped them deal with disappointment.
Muschamp’s backing of his players ranges from 
passionate defense of Sharrif Floyd against the NCAA in 2011 and Jay-nard Bostwick in the face of inaccurate media reports this season to saying Sat-urday’s loss to Georgia “falls on my shoulders.”
Now that Muschamp is under fire, the Gators 
are more than willing to stand behind him.
“To see somebody like that to really have our 
backs means a lot,” Murphy said. “We try to put it all on the field for a coach like that.”
Watkins added: “We definitely love the support 
he gives us, and we’re going to support him right back.”different than what he experi-
enced at Montverde Academy last year.
“Toughest part, how fast 
the ball moves,” Hill said. “I’m not really used to that.”
High expectations follow 
Hill as he enters Florida’s regular-season opener against North Florida on Friday. 
The freshman was added 
Monday to the watch list for the Wayman Tisdale Award, which is given to the top fresh-man in the country at the end of the season. 
With guard Scottie Wil-
bekin out for Friday’s opener due to an indefinite suspen-sion, Hill will continue to as-sume the starting point guard duties. 
Donovan admits he needs 
to do a better job of monitor-ing Hill’s playing time while Wilbekin is out.
“Because we don’t have 
Scottie, he probably plays too many extended minutes,” Donovan said. “I probably should have done a better job of getting him out of the game sooner. 
“I’m probably going to 
need to learn him, in terms of what his body language looks like, when he really starts to get tired. But I still think the tempo, the pace he needs to play with, he needs to play with that level of intensity all the time.”
But if Hill proved any-
thing to the Florida coaching staff Friday night, he showed he will not let early mistakes rattle him. 
“For a freshman to come 
in and basically start his first game and do what he did, especially in the first half, I thought he played very well,” Donovan said.hoops , from page 13coordinator Brent Pease said 
Oct. 15. 
“He works hard in practice. 
He’s starting to fit in, and his op-portunities are coming.”
Morrison facing sophomore 
slump: The most surprising as-pect of Todd Gurley’s 73-yard touchdown catch across the mid-dle was not how open he was. It was the player who failed to get back in coverage.
After an impressive freshman 
season, middle linebacker An-tonio Morrison has hit a rough patch despite leading the team with 46 tackles. Gurley ran him over on his 5-yard touchdown to begin the scoring on Saturday.
Gurley beat a blitzing Morri-
son on a release for the longest touchdown reception of his ca-reer to put UGA up 14-0 in the first quarter. 
Muschamp pointed out that 
while the linebackers need to play better, everything could not be pinned on them with de-fensive linemen not taking up blockers.
“He missed some tackles Sat-
urday,” Muschamp said of Mor-rison. “That was uncharacteris-tic for him.”
Humphries still out: D.J. 
Humphries will miss second-straight game due to a sprained left MCL he suffered during practice on Oct. 28. 
Tyler Moore started in his 
place after starting five of the previous seven games at right tackle.
Trenton Brown joined him 
at right tackle against Georgia, making his first career start at Florida. Collectively, the offensive 
line had perhaps its best game in recent weeks after surrendering 10 sacks to LSU and Missouri combined.
“I thought we improved and 
I thought Trenton did some nice things,” Muschamp said. “He’s a big man. He’s a large body. It’s hard to get on the edges on him. I thought he protected. They had him one time on the hold, which was a good call. They bent the edge on him there, and he got his hand locked around the guy on his shoulder up there. But again, for a first start and going in that environment, I thought he played well.”
Staffer leaves team: Jon 
Haskins, Director of Player Per-sonnel, resigned from his post within the last two weeks, Mus-champ announced Monday.

  Savannah Jordan has single-handedly re-
written Florida history.
  The freshman forward was named the 
Southeastern Conference Offensive Player 
of the Year, the league announced Monday.
  Jordan is the ﬁ  rst freshman in SEC his-
tory to earn the honor, leading the team with 20 goals so far this season. 
  “It was deﬁ  nitely unexpected,” Jordan 
said of her success this season. “I came in here with the intentions just to play and help the team out in whatever way I could. It’s deﬁ  nitely an honor, and I’m thankful that it happened the way it did for me.”
  The freshman also joins teammates Chris-
ten Westphal and Havana Solaun as All-SEC First Team selections.  
  “It’s a credit to the whole team,” coach 
Becky Burleigh said. “Us winning helps get people recognized, so I think the people that were recognized were very deserving.”
  Jordan’s player of the year accolade marks 
the 13th time in program history a Gator earned a SEC Player of the Year honor.   
  She is also this week’s SEC Freshman of 
the Week, making it the third time this sea-son she has earned the award.
  The starting forward helped Florida 
clinch a share of the SEC regular season ti-tle, scoring two goals en route to a 5-1 win against Georgia to end the regular season.  As Florida heads to Orange Beach, Ala., 
for the 2013 SEC Tournament, Jordan will spearhead the Gators in their attempt to claim a second consecutive SEC Tourna-ment Title.
  Even while breaking numerous school 
records and raking in accolade after acco-lade, Jordan remains humble.  “My teammates have helped me out a 
lot,” Jordan said. “It has been a lot easier be-cause of my teammates and how they set me up for goals. I can’t thank the team enough with all they’ve given me this season.”
  Defender honored: In addition to be-
ing named an All-SEC First Team selection, sophomore center back Christen Westphal was named this week’s SEC Defensive Player of the Week, the league announced Monday.
  Westphal has started every game this 
season at center back and leads the Gators with an average of 88.8 minutes per match.
  She closed out the regular season as an 
offensive force, earning an assist on Jordan’s second goal against Texas A&M and scoring a goal off a 40-yard free kick to help boost Florida to a 5-1 victory over Georgia on Thursday.
  “After the assist we were all joking that 
the next thing for me was a goal,” Westphal said.   “I didn’t expect it to be so sudden, but it was good. I liked it.” 16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 2013

  Florida came home with more 
than a pair of victories after win-
ning on the road against LSU and Texas A&M last weekend.
  The Gators brought back some 
hardware.
  Senior middle blocker Chloe 
Mann, junior libero Taylor Unroe and freshman right side hitter Alex Holston swept Southeastern Con-ference weekly honors for their road weekend performances.
  Mann earned SEC Offensive 
Player of the Week after recording a career-high 22 kills in the Gators’ ﬁ  ve-set victory against Texas A&M. Unroe was honored with an SEC Co-Defensive Player of the Week title, sharing the honor with Ten-nessee libero Ellen Mullins.
  Holston was named SEC Fresh-
man of the Week after totaling 34 kills on the weekend, including a career-high 21 at Texas A&M Sunday. She also notched a .459 clip against the Aggies. Holston was named SEC Freshman of the Week once before, on Oct. 7, after the Gators swept Texas A&M and Alabama. 
  Florida, which now holds an 
11-1 SEC record, enters its bye week with some momentum after the successful weekend. Following the week off, UF 
opens its ﬁ  nal six regular season games by hosting South Carolina on Nov. 13. 
  “We’re keep-
ing in mind our goals for the big picture, not just 
for the SEC or for this day,” Un-roe said. “Every day we work on something that will help the big picture.”
  Unroe deﬁ  ned that Gator volley-
ball big picture as: “Getting as deep as we can in the tournament, you know staying injury free, playing our hardest in the SEC and worry-ing about this league ﬁ  rst.” 
  Missouri and Alabama will also 
hit the O’Connell Center court Nov. 15 and Nov. 17. Florida is second in the SEC to an undefeated Missouri.
