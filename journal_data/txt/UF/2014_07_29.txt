The Cost of War
The Students for Justice in Palestine host a “die-in,” on Turlington Plaza on Thursday to protest the Israeli offensive on Gaza. The students lie on the ground with rags covering their heads to demonstrate the death toll of innocent civilians caught up in the conﬂ  ict.

A weekend toga party may cost 
more than a cover charge for the 
Beta Theta Pi fraternity. 
Local police say they found many 
underage drinkers and issued multi-ple noise warnings at an off-campus house.  
On Saturday at about 11:42 p.m., 
a University Police ofﬁ  cer arrived at an “Open House Party,” at 304 NW 15th St., where the ofﬁ  cer saw mul-
tiple toga-clad females.  
As the ofﬁ  cer walked onto the lawn, the party’s music blared. The 
ofﬁ  cer saw 20 males and females dressed in togas waiting to get into the house. 
“The property was enclosed with 
a plastic tarp, and there were two 
‘bouncers’ at the entrance taking $10 
a person,” wrote GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias in an email. 
Hired “security” Tyler M. East-
ridge, 21, and Andrew A. Gonzalez-Louis, 21, were checking IDs and putting on wristbands when ofﬁ  cers arrived on scene. Gonzalez-Louis 
disappeared into the backyard to 
ﬁ  nd the house’s residents.  
Resident Andrew M. Molloy, 20, 
walked up to the ofﬁ  cer along with Tyler J. Ericson, 20. 
The ofﬁ  cer told Eastridge, after 
speaking to the residents, that he would issue a noise warning, ac-Beta Theta Pi to appear in court for busted toga party

Future residents of Gainesville may 
have to leap over a few hurdles before 
hopping on a bicycle. 
The City of Gainesville Public Safe-
ty Commission discussed a potential bicycle registration program on Mon-day that would mandate local cyclists to register their bicycles and pay a fee.
The proposal has generated both 
support and criticism.
Yvonne Hinson-Rawls, a District 1 
commissioner who brought the pro-posal to attention, believes it would be a positive move for the city.
“I’m trying to do what I think is 
good for everybody,” she said. “Every mode of transportation needs its own revenue source.”
Hinson-Rawls said she supports the 
bicycle registration program because she believes it will provide a system of guaranteeing revenue to support the city’s bicycle infrastructure, help educate citizens on how to ride safely when sharing the road with automo-biles and provide a greater means of security in creating a system to help track down lost and stolen bicycles.
She said an enforced registration 
program would also help identify a growing number of criminals who use bicycles when committing crimes.
Other committee members disagree City talks

Even after bringing the heat, Daniel 
Helfrich’s man-sized pepper is still miss-
ing, but the Internet-famous UF student has high hopes and police are on the look-out. 
Social media sites exploded last week 
with pictures of Helfrich and his ill-fated pepper, which  led Chili’s representatives to reach out to his girlfriend, Ellen Toneff, on Twitter.  
They asked her if she could bring him to the Archer Road location today where they are planning to surprise him with an item they are bringing in a truck, Toneff said.  
“He hates surprises!” Toneff said, jok-
ing. “He’s probably going to kill me.” 
She said she thinks they are going to 
give him a replacement chili but isn’t cer-tain. 
Chili’s is now sharing the story on its 
social media to help catch the perpetra-tors.   
If Helfrich’s generous $20 Chili’s gift 
card reward wasn’t enough, Chili’s is now doubling that amount to see the chili back to its rightful owner.  
“Nobody has helped,” Helfrich said, 
unaware of what is to come. 
Helfrich said the Pavilion on 62nd 
apartment complex failed to mention that cameras were near the entrance, possibly showing the pepper culprits. 
Toneff said she feels that whoever took 
the chili is now feeling the heat due to all the media attention. 
“Now, they probably ditched the chili,” 
Toneff said. “I would be freaking out.” UF student’s stolen chili remains hot subjectSEE BETA, PAGE 4

Three girls sat huddled in the 
corner of Sarkara Sweets, playing 
the word game Scattergories in si-lence. 
The entire sweet shop was quiet. 
They were the only customers.
This summer, quiet nights are all 
too common in the sweet shop at 201 SE Second Ave. The lack of custom-ers meant the shop had to cut back on costs. The first thing to go was the custom cupcake bar.
Sarkara Sweets is known for its 
whacky cupcake flavors, and its 
custom cupcake bar is where people 
can build their own cupcakes from a variety of choices. 
Every Summer A, though, the 
lack of customers forces the shop to close its custom bar. 
It is now open for Summer B at 
reduced hours: Wednesday through Saturday from 2 to 9 p.m.
Stephanie Silva, manager and 
co-owner of the store, said whether it stays open depends on if sales in-crease. Sarkara will soon be deciding if it will make the custom cupcakes for the rest of Summer B. 
Everything in the shop is made 
from scratch, Silva said. There is 
not enough money to make all the 
unique items for the custom bar ev-ery day if it is not going to sell. 
She said this is the worst summer 
she and her twin sister and business partner, Susan Stieglitz, have endured in the three-and-a-half years Sarkara has been at its current location. 
The custom cupcake bar is still 
open on what Silva described as a trial run.  The first two weeks, the 
custom bar did not make enough to money to justify being open but picked up in the third week. 
The fourth week will determine 
if the custom bar stays open.Last summer, there were not 
enough customers to keep the cus-tom bar open.
“We’re doing it out of stubborn-
ness and hoping it works,” Silva said.
Monday night, the silence was 
only interrupted when the round of Scattergories ended and the three 
girls burst into animated talking.  
Paige Parnell, Victoria Parnell 
and Keyannie Johnson enjoyed 
a cousin get-together at Sarkara Sweets that night, but they came for a custom cupcake.
Johnson said the custom bar is the 
whole reason they come to Sarkara and Victoria said had they known it 
wouldn’t be open, they would have 
gone somewhere else. 
One time, the three walked in to-
gether and did just that when they discovered that they could not get exactly what they craved.
“I wish it was open,” Paige said.TUESDAY, JULY 29, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Gainesville is becoming a 
technology hub that will soon 
be teeming with job opportuni-ties. 
The UF Tech Connect pro-
gram, part of the UF Office of Technology Licensing, assists technology-oriented startup companies with getting their products on the market. It has helped create 2,000 new jobs in the 12 years that it has been open and is looking to do more. 
“If you want to stay in the 
community, there will be jobs here that enable you to do that,” said Jane Muir, director of UF Tech Connect and asso-ciate director of UF’s Office of Technology Licensing. 
Tech Connect helps entre-
preneurs with their startups through workshops in areas 
such as contracts and business 
plans. It also helps entrepre-neurs with networking and finding investors.  
Muir said Tech Connect 
aims to teach local startup com-panies everything they need to 
be successful. 
“It’s just another tool and 
resource that UF is fortunate 
to have to help accelerate the discoveries that happen in the research laboratories and get them into the marketplace, where they’re making an im-
pact on people’s lives,” Muir 
said. 
John King, CEO of Quantita-
tive Medicine, one of Tech Con-nect’s startup companies, said the services consistently make a big difference in his company. 
“The whole concept that the 
university has built here is well thought out,” King said. 
Leandro Neves, one of the 
founders of RAPiD Genomics, another one of Tech Connect’s startup companies, said the money they received from the university and private inves-tors was really useful. 
“For a young company, it’s 
difficult to put money toward 
research when you have so 
many other expenses to cover,” Neves said. “The money allows us to remain competitive by do-ing research.”
Yatit Thakker, CEO of Omni-
nox Publishing, said the pro-gram is great for new companies and founders that want to learn 
from experts in their field.
“The workshops really come 
in all types of flavors for all kinds 
of companies,” Thakker said. 
The Florida Innovation Hub 
at UF isn’t only focused on help-ing the community in the fu-ture. When they aren’t working on new ideas, they enjoy a little 
friendly competition.   
Muir said the Innovation 
Hub had an internal challenge 
between two floors to see which one could get more entrepre-neurs to donate blood. LifeSouth 
Community Blood Center has a 
good day when they can get 20 people to donate, but after the competition, it had more than 30 blood donations that day. 
“Not only are we smart and 
passionate about what we do, but these young entrepreneurs also believe in giving back to the 
community,” Muir said. UF Tech Connect 
service grows, brings local jobscording to a GPD incident report. If 
the other residents didn’t come out, the officer would park and sit with his lights flashing.     
Of the 12 residents who hosted the 
party, Andrew Molloy, Tyler Ericson, Jeremy W. Williams, 20, and Joshua D. Chapman, 20, came out with their IDs. They said they hired security and charged a cover so people could drink alcohol inside the house. 
All of the responding officers ex-
plained that what they were doing was illegal, considering that they 
didn’t have a liquor license. They all 
understood that their actions were il-legal and irresponsible, according to the report. 
“The actual judicial affairs charg-
es against the fraternity and/or their members would be determined by the staff from Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution (SCCR) once they obtain/review all the information involving what took place and who was involved,” wrote UPD spokes-man Maj. Brad Barber in an email. 
The officers entered the backyard 
and found multiple unattended kegs 
of beer, and inside the house, they 
saw several bottles of vodka and champagne.  
According to police, many par-
ticipants looked underage, and some were intoxicated. 
“Most of the attendees were un-
der 21 years old,” Tobias said. 
Beta house members and the 
above residents did not comment on police allegations. 
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
said UF is currently reviewing the fraternity’s alleged conduct at the party.

Natalie Saliva doesn’t wear 
makeup anymore.
She knows in the time it takes for 
her to bike from her apartment on 
Northwest 16th Avenue to campus, it will melt off.
With a Florida summer on full 
blast, bicyclists like Saliva are find-ing creative ways to adapt to the almost-daily downpours.
Saliva, a 21-year-old UF wildlife 
ecology and conservation senior, said she bikes because she doesn’t have a driver’s license. 
Her close-cropped hair sparkles 
with rain and sweat as she recalls a bicycle crash that left her unable to bend her pinky finger. A little water isn’t going to stop her now.
“If I get wet, I get wet,” she said.Saliva prepares for the weather 
by wearing sleeveless tops, packing as little as possible and bringing a plastic bag to protect her laptop and books.
“I’ve thought about wearing a 
poncho, but honestly, I think it’ll be too much of a distraction as I bike,” she said.
Jake Sauls, a 21-year-old UF ap-
plied physiology & kinesiology ju-nior, has seen bicyclists walk into class wearing plastic bags secured with tape.
“You’re going to walk in, and 
people are going to freak out, and you’re just a bag man walking around,” Sauls said.
He said he bikes because he 
doesn’t trust the bus system, and he doesn’t like walking. 
“It’s just faster,” Sauls said. But convenience isn’t always 
the top priority for Rahul Benda, an 
18-year-old UF chemical engineer-
ing freshman. He also bikes because he prefers it over walking, but if the weather radar shows clouds, he’ll take the walk. Benda said he brings his bicycle 
into his dorm room every night.
“I also have a nice bike, and I 
don’t like it to rust,” Benda said.
Muhammad Rahmani, a Student 
Government Free Bike Repair em-ployee of three years, said he sees a lot of students biking through the rain and leaving their bicycles to the weather.
“Dangerous? I suppose so. But 
really, they just don’t work,” Rah-
mani said. “You just can’t ride them. 
The chains are rusted to hell.”
Rahmani said students should 
take their bicycles inside, or at least cover the chain with a plastic bag. Rusty chains are the No. 1 prevent-able problem at the repair shop. 
When it comes to actually biking 
in the rain, he said to not bother with 
a poncho because it might get stuck 
on the bicycle parts. 
“Just be a man,” Rahmani said. 
“Cover your stuff, and just ride care-fully.” Bicyclists skirt summer showers

ORANGE PARK, Fla. — 
Northeast Florida authorities 
say they’ve arrested two teen-age girls seen in videos posted online lighting a threatened go-
pher tortoise on fire and stomp-
ing it to death.
The Florida Fish and Wild-
life Conservation Commission said the teens, ages 15 and 18, were arrested Friday on charg-es of felony cruelty to animals and taking, harassing, harming or killing a gopher tortoise.
Videos posted on the Face-
book page of Nevada Voters for Animals showed the Orange 
Park girls dousing the tortoise 
with a flammable fluid and one of them stomping on the animal until its shell broke.
The younger girl will be 
prosecuted in the juvenile sys-tem. The other faces up to five years in prison on the felony cruelty charge and up to 60 days 
in jail for the second charge.Florida teens seen

Registration could be source of income
with Hinson-Rawls.
“I think the challenge just on enforcement makes 
it impractical,” said Helen Warren, Commissioner 
At-Large, who chaired the Public Safety Commis-sion meeting.
Warren said she believes a fee would deter 
Gainesville residents from registering their bicy-cles.
The committee also discussed problems with 
bicycle commuters disobeying traffic rules, which creates safety concerns for motor vehicle drivers and pedestrians. 
Warren believes that this issue will open a dis-
cussion with the public on bicycle safety.
“I would like to see more public education 
about what are the rules of the road when you are on a bike,” she said.
Craig Carter, a District 3 commissioner, also 
disagrees with an enforced registration system.“I’m personally not in favor of putting any more 
fees on our citizens or any more obligations on our law enforcement,” he said.
He said that if citizens were required to register 
their bicycles, it would create a problem for out-of-town visitors to Gainesville with bicycles if they were apprehended by local law enforcement.
James Thompson, advocacy director for the 
Gainesville Cycling Club, attended the committee meeting to see where the discussion would go.
Thompson said he believes required registra-
tion fees are a waste of time for the city to pursue. 
When discussion was open to the public during 
the meeting, he said that several of the cities that have enacted a similar program didn’t find it to be a productive measure.
“The evidence is pretty conclusive that this 
practice has never generated any money for any municipality,” he said.
The committee decided to forward the topic to 
full commission for discussion.LiCense , from page 1KYLE FOLLANSBEE AND HANNAH FELL

On the night of the shooting, Larry McLa-
mara had just returned from the store. He 
bought a four pack of Natural Ice beer and a pack of Clifford cigarettes.  
He sat outside his neighbors’ first-floor 
apartment. He and two of his neighbors sat in mismatched wooden chairs as they talked, smoked and drank beer.
It was a nice night. The air was a little bit 
damp, he said, like the sky couldn’t decide if it wanted to rain.
But none of that was unusual. The 56-year-old said he doesn’t remember 
how much time passed while he sat outside.
But he does remember the 30 seconds that 
broke the night’s stillness.
It started with a shout. “Damn, he got a gun!” someone screamed.They heard shots — five of them.“B****, go ahead and call the police,” some-
one else shouted.
“Everyone in the house,” McLamara’s 
friend ordered.
The door closed; The three waited. “Things like that don’t happen here,” 
McLamara said.
•    •     •
When McLamara walked out of his neigh-
bors’ apartment a few hours later, he saw red and blue flashing lights. It was foggy. He said the police were everywhere. He wanted to know what was going on. 
But it wasn’t until hours later that he found 
out. 
•    •     •
According to Gainesville Police, the night unfolded like this: 
On Wednesday at 7:08 p.m., Michael Den-
nison, 41, saw Amanda Stiegemeier in the parking lot of Campus Walk and followed her upstairs into apartment No. 50. 
She slammed the door in his face. Dennison opened the door and walked into 
Stiegemeier’s living room, where two friends argued with him. 
One friend, Shanga Howard, asked him to 
leave. 
“I’ll be back,” he said. Dennison left the apartment, and he walked 
downstairs into the parking lot. 
Stiegemeier looked outside and said she 
saw Dennison holding a, “big black gun.”  
He walked upstairs to apartment No. 50, 
knocked on the door and shouted. No one an-swered. 
He went to the parking lot and fired at the 
apartment.
Howard left the parking lot and returned to 
apartment No. 50, looking for the three people one last time. But he couldn’t find them.
Steigemeier and her friends hid in a kitchen 
of a downstairs apartment. They were afraid Howard would kill them, so they called the police.
 
•    •     •
William “Bill” Rennie is the resident man-
ager of the complex. The 49-year-old said Den-nison was a former tenant. They told him to leave the property a couple of months ago. 
McLamara said people come and go at 
Campus Walk. 
“Tell you the truth,” he said, “I wouldn’t 
know (Dennison) if I saw him.”
McLamara said Rennie told Dennison to 
leave because he didn’t pay rent.
“This isn’t the f****** ghetto,” he said. “If I 
can’t settle my differences, I ain’t never gonna pull out a weapon.”
•    •     •
When police arrived, they saw Dennison 
running from the apartment complex.
Later, police found several bullet casings 
in the parking lot outside apartment No. 50. and bullet holes in the side of the apartment 
complex. 
Krista Fulp, a witness, said she heard shots 
and saw Dennison walking downstairs, carry-
ing a gun.
She said he waved the gun in the air and threatened Stiegemeier and her friends. He said he wasn’t messing around and that there was more to come. 
But neighbors like McLamara hope Denni-
son won’t return. 
On Sept. 2, McLamara will turn 57. Even 
though he said he has witnessed a lot in his life, he hopes he never sees more gun violence. 
“I’m not scared of dying,” McLamara said, 
“but what scares me most is living in a world where punks like that rule the world.”
Officers booked Dennison into the Alachua 
County Jail on Wednesday at about 8:50 p.m. As of press time, his bond is set at $1 million. TUESDAY, JULY 29, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

BOONE, N.C. — A second Ameri-
can aid worker has tested positive for 
the Ebola virus at the same hospital in Liberia where an American doc-tor became infected while helping 
to combat an outbreak of the deadly 
disease, a relief group official said Sunday.
Ken Isaacs, vice president of Sa-
maritan’s Purse, told The Associated Press that Dr. Kent Brantly — the 33-year-old medical director for the group’s Ebola care center on the out-skirts of the Liberian capital of Mon-
rovia — was stable and in very seri-
ous condition.
“We are hopeful and prayerful,” 
Isaacs told AP by telephone from the group headquarters in Boone, North Carolina. He said the doctor quickly recognized the symptoms and sought speedy treatment.
Isaacs identified the second Amer-
ican, Nancy Writebol, as a worker with an allied aid group Serving In Mission (SIM) which runs the hos-pital where Samaritan’s Purse has an Ebola care center on the grounds. He said she was in stable and serious condition.
He said both Americans have 
since been isolated and are under 
intensive treatment. The highly 
contagious virus is one of the most deadly diseases in the world. The World Health Organization said the outbreak is the largest ever recorded, killing more than 670 people in Libe-
ria, Guinea and Sierra Leone since it 
began earlier this year. Health work-ers are at serious risk of contracting 
the disease, which spreads through contact with bodi-ly fluids.
There is no 
known cure for 
Ebola, which be-
gins with symp-toms including fever and sore 
throat and escalates to vomiting, diar-rhea and internal and external bleed-ing. The WHO says the disease is not contagious until a person begins to show symptoms.
Brantly is an alumna of Indiana 
University School of Medicine and went to Liberia as part of a two-year fellowship with Samaritan’s Purse, shortly after he completed his resi-dency in family medicine at John Pe-ter Smith Hospital in Texas.
“The caliber of a person like that 
who says, ‘I’m going Africa, I’m going 
to where people need me the most,’ 
it really speaks to you,” Robert Ear-ley, president and CEO of JPS Health Network, said Sunday. “It speaks to your heart.”Second American in

That BuzzFeed listicle you 
just read in class may not be 
helping your grades.
A recent study has found 
a correlation between a stu-dent’s grades and the fre-quency in which they access nonacademic material online during class.
The study, conducted by 
researchers at Michigan State University, questioned 196 students in a lecture course regarding such use of their cellphones and laptops.
The researchers found that 
regardless of intellectual abil-ity, gauged using ACT scores, the students’ grades decreased as the frequency and duration of Internet surfing increased.
Ali Schmitz, a 20-year-old 
UF journalism junior, said she needs to switch between sev-eral different activities during lecture to stay present, includ-ing using her phone, listening and taking notes.
When Schmitz takes lecture 
notes on her laptop, she usu-ally refrains from perusing the Internet. However, if the pro-fessor mentions something in passing that sparks her curios-ity, she often starts research-ing the matter. Alyssa Skryd, a 17-year-old 
UF health science freshman, said she usually has no prob-lem staying focused in class.
With the rate at which pro-
fessors speak and run through material, Skryd said, using a laptop to take notes is the best way for her to capture the ma-terial.   
To help struggling students 
stay focused, some professors give students the PowerPoint slides in advance. 
“If a student has to keep 
up with the rat-a-tat-tat of the professor,” said Norman Lewis, associate professor in the department of journalism, “then there needs to be a bet-ter way of presenting the ma-terial.”
Expecting students to learn 
while they furiously attempt to capture in writing the spo-ken word and the content of slides, he said, benefits neither the student nor the professor.   Whether we can multitask 
has nothing to do with how smart we are and more to do with how our brains are wired, Lewis said. 
“Our brains are wired to fo-
cus on one thing at a time,” he added.
Taylor Stein, professor and 
graduate coordinator for the School of Forest Resources and Conservation at UF, said he tends to witness more stu-dents on cellphones, most like-ly texting, than on laptops in the lecture courses he teaches.
When students are looking 
at their laps and smiling, he said, it’s obvious they aren’t paying attention.
Stein and other members of 
the department have discussed restricting the use of laptops in class, in the hopes of eliminat-ing Internet surfing, he said.
However, asking students 
to not use laptops would eliminate a significant way in which students contribute to the class, he added. Students often contribute information to the classroom that they re-search during a lecture. 
“Most professors are not 
taught how to teach,” he said. “We try to do our best . . . Tex-ting and surfing is rude to the professor.”

“If a student has to 
keep up with the rat-a-
tat-tat of the professor, 
then there needs to be a 
better way of presenting 
the material.”

undermine FL 
gubernatorial race
Unless you’re a TV-less hipster (getting all your shows 
on Hulu/Netﬂ  ix/HBO Go — yeah, we’re on to you), you’ve been bombarded with the predictable mud-ﬂ  ing-
ing political ads as November elections draw closer and closer. As they’d have you believe, Rick Scott is a reptilian warlord in 
a human skin suit, and Charlie Crist is a slick turncoat pushing 
for education cuts. 
While those claims aren’t 100 percent true, and while scath-
ing political ads are the new normal, Scott and Crist are on their way to making history as the least popular Florida gubernatorial candidates ever. Preliminary polls have shown that Floridians have, at best, lukewarm feelings for both politicians, which is nothing short of depressing. 
Scott has been unpopular for most of his term, and the most 
recent Quinnipiac University poll found that 45 percent of vot-ers have an unfavorable view of him, while only 40 percent have a favorable view. Crist’s unfavorable-to-favorable ratio was only slightly better, at 42 to 40 percent. 
Dismal numbers like these are incredibly rare in this stage 
of the campaign season, coming third only to former Illinois Gov Rod Blagojevich in 2006 and the 2009 New Jersey election between Chris Christie and Jon Corzine, who “pummeled each other” with negative ads, according to FiveThirtyEight Data 
Lab. The article on Scott and Crist’s historical disapproval rat-
ings noted that onslaughts of negative ads appear to correlate with elections that include record-breaking unfavorable views of gubernatorial candidates. 
PolitiFact Florida has had a ﬁ  eld day with the nasty, mostly 
half-true or downright false ads. Last week, they debunked a hypocritical Crist ad (hypoCristical?) that claimed Rick Scott cut Bright Futures scholarships “in half.” The claim was misleading, they said, because Scott didn’t cut the dollar amount of schol-
arships in half. The Crist campaign “zeroed in on the number 
of scholarships that were distributed last year compared to an estimate for the upcoming school year.”
Furthermore, under Crist, the Legislature raised the stan-
dards to reduce the number of scholarships awarded. Scott later raised the standards more, effectively cutting the number of scholarships awarded further. 
Mudslinging isn’t the only problem in this election, though: 
The Republican Party of Florida straight-up lied about Scott in-
creasing funding for preschool education. An ad they’ve been 
circulating claims that Scott oversaw “more funds for preschool education,” but in reality, per-pupil spending dipped during Scott’s ﬁ  rst year as governor and remained ﬂ  at for the next few years. The Legislature did approve slightly higher overall fund-ing appropriation for pre-K education, but the ads are highly misleading.  While we hesitate to propose something like ad-campaign regulations and hope that the political ad industry could self-police — well, that just doesn’t seem likely. In the 
meantime, beware: Scott and Crist are hiding many faces. Many 
Voldemort-y, overly tanned faces.

datory bike registration in Gainesville? Today’s question: Have you heard about the giant chili 
theft?World events don’t need US’ blessing
America must come to grips with an uncomfortable 
reality: Our world inﬂ  uence is beginning to wane. The two main crises that have dominated the air-
waves for the past few weeks, the Malaysian Airline downed by Russian-backed Ukrainian separatist forces and the lat-est chapter in the Israeli-Palestinian conﬂ  ict, have made this development perfectly clear. We have overstretched, over-
reached and overplayed our inﬂ  uence for too long.  
Take the ﬁ  rst crisis, for example. We have to realize that 
Europe is a more important player in dealing with Russia than America, and Europe has no interest in slapping Pu-
tin’s wrist. Flying in the face of U.S.-led sanctions against the country, Russia has secured a $400 billion natural-gas deal with China and continues to exercise its energy sec-
tor inﬂ  uence on a dependent Europe. In addition to energy 
deals, France proceeded with its warship trade with the Kremlin. It’s not to say that these events occurred to spite America, but they did occur in spite of American protest.  
The Netherlands has not led the international commu-
nity against Russia. If it, the country that has suffered the most in this tragedy, hasnn’t already directed action against Russia, it probably won’t ever happen. And if that’s the case, then Sen. Lindsey Graham’s, R.-S.C., foreign policy plan of simply calling Putin a “thug” in order to unite coun-
tries against Russia will be ineffectual.
Putin invaded Crimea and annexed the country not too 
long ago, and the U.S. tried to rally the international com-
munity to stop the annexation. The majority of the world 
did not comply, and a Russian Crimea is now a given. 
A new shift in Europe has taken America by surprise: 
Britain and France, the two European powers that have 
tolerated a strong American world inﬂ  uence, are taking a backseat in the continent to Germany, the European Union’s 
de facto leader. A solid relationship with Deutschland has 
become undone by the revelations of NSA wiretapping on the German Chancellor. 
As foreign policy expert Ian Bremmer recounts during 
the Germany-U.S. World Cup match, “As American fans chanted ‘U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!’ the Germans countered with, ‘N-S-A! N-S-A! N-S-A!’” 
Germany is dubious about a 
strong American world presence, and Europe seems to be adjusting itself to a world that does not au-
tomatically bow the knee to every 
American ﬁ  at. 
Now take a look at the ongo-
ing crisis in the West Bank: Secretary of State John Kerry is still trying to broker a deal with the two warring sides. But Kerry, just like the last time he tried such a deal, will do so in vain. The violence will continue with or without 
an American-led deal. We shouldn’t kid ourselves that we 
make a difference in peace talks.  
One regional power is surprisingly throwing its hat into 
the fray. We have to come to the queasy realization that Egypt — despite its humanitarian rights violations — is 
holding a fair amount of power in the region. As a National 
Review Online headline reads, “Israel Now Sees Egypt as More Reliable Ally than U.S.”  
It is unclear if Egypt will have more success in the con-
ﬂ  ict than we have, but it is telling which countries are ﬁ  lling 
in the “inﬂ  uence vacuum.” 
I personally ﬁ  nd it odd that so many pundits want 
America to directly intervene in Ukraine and the Middle 
East. But the countries that are within our greatest sphere 
of inﬂ  uence — Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras — we have 
absolutely no control over. It’s hard to square that circle.    
America does have an important role in the internation-
al community. But simply giving in to our knee-jerk reac-tion of controlling all world events is not feasible. There will 
come a time when the rest of the world will just stop listen-
ing to us. Unfortunately, it looks like we haven’t realized it’s already happening.

You walk into a restaurant at 6:55 p.m. 
in anticipation of your 7 p.m. date. 
When 7:10 p.m. approaches, there is 
no sign of your date. And when you cau-
tiously pick up the phone to call, there is no answer. You wait a little longer and call 
again. Someone picks up the phone, and within a mere second, the call is ended.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netan-
yahu has been sitting at the table waiting for 
his “date,” but Hamas has not responded. 
According to the Wall Street Journal, Egypt ﬁ  rst proposed a cease-ﬁ  re between Israel 
and Hamas on July 15. 
Although Israel and Netanyahu agreed to 
the terms of the cease- ﬁ  re and halted rocket attacks for six hours, the leading governing 
body of Gaza, Hamas, chose to decline the 
offer and continued ﬁ  ring rockets indiscrim-
inately.
Gaza militants have ﬁ  red more than 2,200 
rockets at Israel over the past 20 days, ac-cording to The New York Times. 
The current tension between Is-
rael and Gaza was heightened after three Israeli boys were 
kidnapped and murdered by Hamas terrorists on June 12,  
and Israeli extremists in Jerusalem retaliated by murdering a Palestinian boy. 
Immediately, while Israeli ofﬁ  cials con-
demned and incarcerated the aggressors, 
Hamas operatives responded to the deaths 
and the grief of the Israeli government by ﬁ  ring more rockets into Israel, The Guard-
ian reported. 
Israel has taken the necessary precautions 
to avoid civilian casualties by informing the citizens of Gaza of impending strikes on ter-
rorist structures through leaﬂ  ets, phone calls 
and text messages while also offering medi-
cal services and ﬁ  xing a power plant in Gaza 
destroyed by Hamas’s own rockets, accord-ing to The Hufﬁ  ngton Post. Sami Abu Zuhri, a spokes-
man for Hamas, explained that 
“the policy of people confronting the Israeli war planes with their 
bare chests in order to protect their homes has proven effective 
against the occupation [Israel].” 
While the death of any civilian is far from 
desirable, Hamas has military command centers and ﬁ  ring locations in and very close to mosques, hospitals, schools and homes.
A second cease-ﬁ  re was established by 
the United Nations on July 17, but, accord-ing to The Guardian, Hamas continued to rain down rockets into Israel just two hours 
after it began.  
Israel then launched a ground operation 
into Gaza to destroy the tunnels that Hamas 
operatives have been using to inﬁ  ltrate Is-
rael and store rockets. 
Israel has established underground bomb 
shelters and uses the iron dome system to protect its citizens, which, according to Fox 
News, has had a 90 percent success rate in 
shooting down incoming rockets.
There have been multiple opportunities 
for discussing peace. Netanyahu has prov-
en and stated multiple times his desire for 
peace, something seen this past weekend.
Netanyahu initiated a 24-hour humani-
tarian cease-ﬁ  re in cooperation with a lag-
ging Palestinian government that continued to ﬁ  re rockets up until early Sunday after-
noon.

partner is sitting at the other side of the table

Summers in Florida mean out-
ﬁ  ts that contain as few articles of clothing as possible. 
So it’s an understatement to say 
that I’m jealous of the men who can 
go shirtless — and wear one fewer 
thing — on these mid-90 degree days. 
Here’s some history for you: Men 
haven’t always been able to go shirt-less. Religious individuals in the 1900s banned all nipples in public places.
In 1935, 42 men were arrested for 
going topless in Atlantic City. The male population protested, and the male topless ban was subsequently lifted in 1936.
“Suddenly a man’s nipples were 
no longer ‘obscene’ in society, but rather commonplace and natural,” according to The Hufﬁ  ngton Post. 
That’s ﬁ  ne and dandy. There’s 
nothing wrong with a little nipple, right?
Well, apparently there is — as 
long as it’s a female nipple.
It’s an everyday occurrence for 
a male to go without a shirt, but it’s still illegal for women to go topless in 35 states.
Enter the Free The Nipple move-
ment, which is ﬁ  ghting back against this form of female censorship.
The movement is bolstered by the “Free the Nipple” ﬁ  lm, a com-edy directed by Lina Esco released earlier this year. It explored the con-tradiction of America’s gloriﬁ  cation of violence to our country’s censor-
ship of women’s bodies.
According to the ﬁ  lm’s website, 
“The issues we’re addressing are 
equal rights for men and women, a more balanced system of censor-ship, and legal rights for all women to breastfeed in public.” 
Arguably, the reason it is still il-
legal for women — or those who 
do not identify as women but have 
“typically” female breasts, to go top-less — is because breasts are hyper-sexualized in our culture.
We see breasts as sexy and attrac-
tive, and we derive sexual pleasure from said breasts.
In reality, female breasts are not 
sexual organs. They are scientiﬁ  cally 
classiﬁ  ed as secondary sex charac-
teristics, similar to the male Adam’s apple.
Consider this my petition to 
sexualize Adam’s apples as we do breasts.
Really though, my breasts ex-
ist because they house mammary glands that will someday feed any 
children I might have.
Sure, I know my breasts are 
ﬁ  ne as hell, but if you really think about it, there is nothing sexy or 
sexual about sacks of fat that contain milk glands, which is what breasts anatomically are.
The legality of going topless in 
Florida is ambiguous. Title XLVI, Chapter 800, of the Florida statute limits indecent exposure and expo-sure of sexual organs, but makes no speciﬁ  c mention of breasts except to allow breastfeeding. 
In 2006, Elizabeth Book set the 
precedent for exposing her breasts as part of a political protest. The ap-
peals court held that women could 
“demonstrate topless as part of a le-gitimate political protest,” according to an NBC article. 
However, Florida law still leaves 
going topless in any other scenario up for interpretation. 
The Gainesville municipal code 
is a little more speciﬁ  c. Chapter 17, 
article II, covers nudity in public 
places. 
The code explicitly includes “the female breast” in its deﬁ  nition sec-tion of nudity and states, “It shall be unlawful for any person to know-ingly, intentionally, or recklessly appear, or cause another person to 
appear, nude in a public place or in 
any other place which is readily vis-ible to the public.” 
So it’s still illegal for women to 
expose their breasts — which are made of the same breast tissue, areola and nipple that male breasts are composed of — despite the fact that men have been able to do so for 
more than 75 years.
The issue may seem trivial. Put 
on a tank top. Wear a bra. Get over 
it. 
But it’s these policies and laws 
prohibiting toplessness that add to the commodiﬁ  cation of women’s bodies in our society.
The oversexualization of wom-
en’s bodies make it so that our bod-ies are seen as property or a source of pleasure rather than something we have ownership and autonomy over.
Don’t believe me? If I wanted, I 
could go to the drugstore or the gas station right now and buy a porno-graphic magazine, which contains 
images of naked women. 
I can buy nudity, but I myself 
cannot be nude.Sex worker Violet Rose summed 
it up when she said, “It is illegal for 
women to go topless in most cit-ies, yet you can buy a magazine of a woman without her top on at 
any 7-Eleven store. So, you can sell 
breasts, but you cannot wear breasts, in America.”
This double standard leads to 
bigger issues: criminalization of breastfeeding in public, the use of “what was she wearing” as a de-fense for sexual assaults, sexism in the workplace.
There’s no easy solution to this. 
There’s no quick ﬁ  x. Even though it’s legal to organize a topless protest in Turlington — which we should deﬁ  nitely do, by the way — that’s probably not going to effect a big change in our society or laws.
What I can do is encourage you 
to explore the Free The Nipple 
movement. 
On days when you decide to go 
braless, I can support you, even, and 
especially, if you might be able to see your nipples through your shirt.
And on days when it feels like 
105 degrees outside and I glare at the shirtless men on campus, I can think that we, as women, deserve 
that same right.

When two campus groups asked to talk about 
rape during new students’ Preview, they were told they spend too much time addressing major con-cerns, like residence halls and meal plans, to discuss 
grim topics. “They should hear from these groups 
now before they have to ﬁ  nd out by necessity,” one parent said. “Then it’s too late.” UF ofﬁ  cials said while they agreed with the groups’ importance, they just couldn’t ﬁ  t them in to the schedule. 
July 29, 1999Student Government ofﬁ  cials joined in to lobby 
against an anti-rave law making its way through 
Gainesville’s City Commission. They took the city’s 
vote against the law, which would force businesses with liquor licenses to close by 2 a.m., as a signal they were having an effect on off-campus politics. The law was expected to do away with raves be-cause they would be forced to close at the same time they were getting started.

It was a sneak attack. There were bashed-in 
heads and missing eyebrows. A string of vandal-
ism swept across Gainesville when a series of ga-tor statues were defaced. One of the most harmed gators, “Power Gator” in front of City Hall, was even taken away in an ambulance to the emergency room, later taken to an artist’s studio for recovery. Although the city had no plans to investigate,  the perpetrators could’ve faced a third-degree felony.

Willie Royster was almost invis-
ible behind bookshelves holding 
heaps of Gator merchandise in the Gator Sportshop at Gate 18 of the Ben 
Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. 
The store was empty except for 
a family that walked out without a 
purchase. Later,  a man walked in, bought a Mountain Dew and left.
Usually closed during the sum-
mer, the store has been testing the waters of summer sales.  After Follet — the corporation that owns the UF Bookstore  — took over management of stadium merchandise, sales have increased. 
“They only let us have a little sand-
wich board to put out there to let peo-ple know we’re open,” said Royster, a sales associate who worked for UF for nearly 25 years. “The other store has big neon signs.”
The small signs haven’t negatively 
impacted business, however, because 
many people walk through the store 
that opened under Follet in mid-Feb-ruary.   
“That’s who we used to be before 
Follet,” said Royster, pulling out an 
old merchandise bag with a Florida 
Gators logo from behind the counter.
And according to employees, the summer sales have been good. 
Even though the UF Bookstore has 
more merchandise, Royster said, she believes once people know that the 
store is now open, more people will 
shop there. 
“We are kind of spread thin right 
now,” said Royster. “Follet lets (the 
UF Bookstore) have so many part-
time workers, and we just have to do 
with what we can.” 
Patti Borelli, team leader of gen-
eral merchandise for the sales ﬂ  oor 
at the bookstore, said August is the store’s most hectic month.
The bookstore is busier than any 
other store on campus, she said. 
She said the bookstore has an es-
timated 60 part-time employees to help run efﬁ  ciently, and it is looking to hire more employees for the begin-ning of Fall.8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 29, 2014

Weeks of airstrikes, elusive cease-ﬁ  res and a ﬂ  ight ban 
have not deterred a teen travel program from continuing 
trips to Israel.
Taglit-Birthright Israel, an international nonproﬁ  t orga-
nization that sponsors free, 10-day trips to Israel for Jewish 
young adults, is continuing its program amid safety con-
cerns that led the Federal Aviation Administration to ban ﬂ  ights to Israel.
The ban, issued on July 21, was lifted in 36 hours, accord-
ing to a USA Today report.
Jonah Stein, executive vice president of UF’s Jewish Stu-
dent Union, traveled to Israel on Birthright in May and said he’s glad the ban was lifted.
“Regardless of the safety issue(s), which I don’t think 
there are, people need to continue going to Israel,” Stein said.
UF Hillel, which sends more than 100 UF students to Is-
rael on Birthright each year, has no plans to cancel trips.
“Fear doesn’t help anything,” said Gia Campana, UF Hil-
lel’s Israel engagement coordinator. “If Birthright Interna-tional says it’s safe, I think we are safe.”
Chanie Goldman, an executive director of Lubavitch-
Chabad of Gainesville, said she thinks Birthright should 
continue.
“A lot of what is going in the world makes (Jewish young 
adults) even more want to ﬁ  nd out about their heritage,” 
Goldman said. “It’s up to the parents at the end of the day.”
Gail Hyman, Birthright vice president of communication 
and marketing, wrote in an email that participants’ safety is the organization’s primary concern. To ensure their well-be-ing, those currently on Birthright trips will not visit Tel Aviv and southern sections of the country “where the conﬂ  ict has 
intensiﬁ  ed.”
This is not the ﬁ  rst time military casualties have impacted 
Birthright. Shortly after Birthright was established in 1999, 
the Second Intifada, a Palestinian uprising against Israeli oc-cupation, caused a volume of cancellations — 30 to 40 per-cent — similar to what Birthright is seeing.
And regardless of safety concerns, Birthright should con-
tinue, Stein said.
“We have an obligation to go to Israel to see things for 
ourselves and understand how important that country is for us as Jewish people.”Birthright trips not stopped by conﬂ  ict

� THE DECISION IS NOT IN EFFECT.
TANIMA MEHROTRA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Florida’s ban on same-sex marriage has been declared 
unconstitutional for the second time this month.
The Friday ruling by Miami-Dade County Circuit 
Judge Sarah Zabel mirrored the decision made two weeks 
ago by Monroe County Circuit Judge Luis Garcia.
“Preventing couples from marrying solely on the ba-
sis of their sexual orientation serves no governmental in-terest,” Judge Zabel wrote in her opinion. 
She also ordered an immediate stay of her ruling. At-
torney General Pam Bondi ﬁ  led an appeal shortly after. 
Darren Hutchinson, a UF law professor, said most 
judges who have ruled in favor of same-sex couples have stayed their ruling in anticipation of appeals by state de-fendants, as Bondi has done in both Florida cases thus 
far. 
This puts the effects of the ruling on hold until a clean 
decision has been made. 
“They’re just trying to avoid the chaos that could re-
sult if couples started getting married and an appeals 
court later reversed the ruling favoring same-sex mar-riage,” Hutchinson said. 
Mallory Garner-Wells, public policy director of Equal-
ity Florida, the organization that ﬁ  led the lawsuit along with six same-sex couples, said that it is likely that the Miami and Key West lawsuit will be combined into one case.
“They ask the same fundamental question: Should 
Florida recognize same-sex marriages?” She said. 
The Miami-Dade ruling is one of many court deci-
sions striking down same-sex marriage bans in the U.S., most recently in Colorado and Virginia. 
“I think they’re moving past questions about moral-
ity to questions about equal protection under the 14th Amendment,” Steven Noll, a UF history professor said. “Even conservative judges that may feel homosexuality is not acceptable ﬁ  nd that there is no legal justiﬁ  cation that same-sex marriage is illegal.”
Both Garcia and Zabel were appointed by former 
Gov. Jeb Bush and re-elected.
“These are not liberal judges castigated by the right as 
makers of new law. It’s not a liberal fringe that’s moving 
the country this way,” Noll said. “It’s people who follow 
the law.”
Hutchinson believes that both judges felt comfortable 
by ruling in favor of same-sex marriage because they’re aware of how public opinion on the issue is shifting.
“When judges make decisions in controversial cases, 
they try to be aware of how the decision will be received,” Hutchinson said. “The judges in Florida know the tide is turning.”Second Florida

CAMPUS
JOEY MARTINEZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
A UF student with high-functioning 
autism wants to help incoming fresh-
men survive their ﬁ  rst year of college.
Haley Moss, a 19-year-old UF psy-
chology and criminology senior, pub-
lished her second book on Monday. 
The book, “A Freshman Survival Guide for College Students with Autism Spec-trum Disorders: The Stuff Nobody Tells you About!,” is about her experiences during her ﬁ  rst year of college.
Moss was diagnosed with high-
functioning autism when she was 3 years old. She published her ﬁ  rst book, 
“Middle School: The Stuff Nobody Tells 
You About,” in 2010.
“When I was at the transition point 
between high school and college, there wasn’t a lot out there except for things written by parents,” Moss said. “When you are at that point, you want to hear about it from a student who’s been through it. If one person gets some-thing out of this book, then I have done 
my job.”
She said her ﬁ  rst year at UF was en-
joyable but challenging. Routine tasks 
were difﬁ  cult for her to understand at ﬁ  rst.
“The ﬁ  rst time I did laundry at UF, I 
put all my clothes and detergent in the dryer,” she said.
Moss wrote her book in about a 
month during the summer, but the publishing process, from start to ﬁ  nish, took a whole year.
Ann-Marie Orlando, coordinator for 
education and training programs at the UF Center for Autism and Related Dis-abilities, said writing a book while main-taining a full-time college course load is an accomplishment for any student.
“I think everyone can be encour-
aged and empowered by her story. I think when community awareness, 
knowledge and acceptance is increased, 
it opens the door to opportunity,” Or-lando said. 
Moss’ book is available for purchase 
on Amazon.com Inc.’s Kindle and Barnes & Noble Inc.’s Nook e-book reader, as well as printed paperback through Ama-zon and Barnes & Noble.UF student publishes her second book
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON — A freshman Republican lawmaker 
has apologized for mistaking two senior U.S. government of-
ﬁ  cials as visitors from India when they testiﬁ  ed at a congres-sional hearing.
Rep. Curt Clawson, R-Fla., caused puzzlement at a hear-
ing of a House subcommittee hearing Thursday on U.S.-In-dia relations. He referred to the South Asian nation as “your country” when he addressed the State Department and Com-merce Department ofﬁ  cials, both ethnic Indian.
Clawson said in a statement Monday: “I made a mistake 
in speaking before being fully briefed, and I apologize. I’m a 
quick study but in this case I shot an air ball.”
Clawson, former chief executive of an aluminum wheel 
company, won a special election in April to represent a dis-
trict in Florida. He is the newest member of the House Com-mittee on Foreign Affairs.Lawmaker apologizes for racial gaffe“The ﬁ  rst time I did laundry 
at UF, I put all my clothes and 
detergent in the dryer.”

Ray-Ray McCloud III an-
nounced his verbal commit-
ment to Clemson on Monday 
evening. The commitment came 
as somewhat of a surprise as McCloud was in attendance at UF’s Friday Night Lights camp. 
The feeling was that McCloud 
would go with Florida with Gainesville fresh on his mind.
Four-star cornerback de-
commits from Florida: 2015 
cornerback Marcus Lewis (6 foot 194 pounds, Washington, D.C., Gonzaga Collegiate Acad-emy) decommitted from UF on 
Monday. 
Lewis had been waver-
ing on his commitment for the 
last month. He took a visit to Michigan this past weekend. 
Although he is decommitted, 
his top four schools include Florida, Michigan, Miami and Oregon. Florida’s 2015 class 
remains with just seven verbal 
commitments.
Friday Night Lights note-
book: The 2014 session of Fri-day Night Lights featured some of the top recruiting prospects from across the country. Sev-eral Gators targets, commits 
and even current UF football 
players were on hand from the event.
2016 cornerback commit 
shines: Current Florida corner-back commit Chauncey Gard-ner (5-foot-11, 190 pounds, Co-coa, Fla., Cocoa High) worked out on Friday and set himself 
far apart from the other corner-
backs. 
As a rising high school ju-
nior, Gardner showed impres-
sive speed and girth for his age. 
He flipped his commitment from Miami to Florida after attending Will Muschamp’s camp in early June.
No. 4-ranked linebacker 
shows versatility: Outside line-
backer Jeffery Holland (6-foot-1, 225 pounds, Jacksonville, Fla., Trinity Christian Academy) worked out at both linebacker 
and, believe it or not, wide re-
ceiver on Friday. 
Holland said he feels com-
fortable on both sides of the ball although he is listed as a line-backer.
“My first position was play-
ing . . . running back, then I got moved to receiver so I’m really new to defense,” he said. “But I just can do it.”
Holland was on campus as 
early as Wednesday and said he thoroughly enjoyed being on campus with former Trinity teammates Nick Washington 
and Kavaris Harkless.
“It was great; I just got to 
hang out with the players,” 
Holland said. “They really 
didn’t take it as a recruiting trip, 
I just came to hang out and kick it with the coaches.”
Holland’s top schools in-
clude Florida, Auburn and 
UCLA. He is planning on en-
rolling early so he is expected to make a decision in December.
Roquan Smith enjoys visit: 
Linebacker Roquan Smith (6 foot, 203 pounds, Montezuma, Ga., Macon County High) was in attendance Friday, but he did not work out. 
“It was a pretty good vis-
it,” Smith said. “I enjoyed it. I watched some of the players go out there and compete. It was a Notebook: McCloud chooses 
Clemson, Lewis decommits

With NFL training camps in session 
for the upcoming 2014 season, former 
Gator greats are on the rise while oth-ers are not.
Matt Elam has shown he’s ready 
to be a standout for the Baltimore Ra-vens defensive unit.
The second-year safety out of Flor-
ida complied 77 combined tackles last season, which is eight fewer than for-mer Raven Ed Reed had in his rookie campaign.Elam will now be reuniting with 
his natural position of strong safety and is expected to improve on what he has already accomplished.
Elam registered 66 tackles with 
only three pass breakups and an in-terception at the free safety position 
in 2013. James Ihedigbo, now with 
the Detroit Lions, occupied the strong safety slot. 
With Ihedigbo out of town, Elam is 
now returning to pressuring the line of scrimmage instead of playing the backfield.
In one start at strong safety last sea-
son, Elam had his highest-rated game Gators in the NFL: Elam 
returns to strong safetyPosition Preview

AlligatorSports continues its 2014 Florida foot-
ball position breakdown by turning its attention to 
the running backs.
Florida enters the 2014 season with one of 
the deepest running-back corps in the South-
eastern Conference. 
The group is led by sophomore Kelvin Tay-
lor. Taylor, the son of former Gator and NFL 
great tailback Fred Taylor, had a breakout sea-son in 2013. He racked up 508 yards and four touchdowns. 
His best games came against Missouri, 
where he averaged six yards per carry, and South Carolina, rushing for 96 yards and add-
ing the Gators’ only two touchdowns of the 
game. He was voted on the Freshman All-SEC team by the league’s coaches following the season. With a year of experience under his belt, expect Taylor to carry the bulk of the rushing load for 2014.
Redshirt senior Mack Brown returns after leading the team in rushing yards (543) at the end of last season. Brown exceled in last year’s opener against Toledo, gaining 112 yards on 
the ground and adding two touchdowns, but 
he wasn’t able to rush for more than 100 yards in a game after that point. His next best game came against Tennessee, where he had 86 yards and a touchdown.
Brown and Taylor 
aren’t the only return-ing starters for Florida’s running game. 
Junior Matt Jones is fully healthy after he 
suffered an MCL tear during the LSU game on Oct. 12, which sidelined him for the remain-der of the 2013 season. Jones wasn’t full-go for most of the season before his injury either. 
He had a mysterious viral infection that 
kept him off the field for part of fall camp, and he didn’t play until the Miami game on Sept. 7.  He had a rusty performance of just 47 yards 
on 18 carries in Coral Gables. Running back to success in ‘14

Alligator Staff Writers
As part of the Alligator Awards 
recognizing the best in UF athlet-
ics during the 2013-14 season, staff writers Jordan McPherson and Eden Otero will debate two of the 
ﬁ  ve nominees for best male athlete. 
Check out the rest of the nominees in the graphic below and vote for the winner online at alligatorSports.org
Jordan: There were several 
bright spots from Florida’s male athletes this season, but Dedric Dukes stood above the rest.
The junior sprinter on UF’s 
track and ﬁ  eld squad set personal bests in every event he competed in this season. He ran the third leg of the 4x400-meter relay team during the indoor season that broke a school record, which was from 2005.
That same 4x400 relay team of 
Najee Glass, Hugh Graham Jr., 
Dukes and Arman Hall was also 
the ﬁ  rst in school history to break the three-minute barrier in the outdoor season.
Individually, Dukes domi-
nated the 200-meter dash dur-ing both campaigns, running the fastest time in school history in both the outdoor (19.91 seconds) and indoor (20.34) seasons since the turn of the century.
Need I say more?Eden: I’m going to get behind 
you on the track and ﬁ  eld senti-ment, but I’m going to have to say junior long and triple jumper Marquis Dendy was the best.
Dendy completed his year 
with an outdoor national title win in the long and triple jump, which had not been done since 
2002.
The win marked Dendy’s sec-
ond individual NCAA title win 
in two years (in 2013 Dendy won the indoor long jump title) and the ﬁ  rst time in UF history a Gator won the outdoor long jump.
What’s even more impressive 
about Dendy’s win is that he re-
placed his best triple jump score 
with 17.05 meters. And for those of you that don’t know the metric system, that’s 55 feet. Let me say it again: 55 feet.
That set him up as Florida’s 
ﬁ  fth-farthest triple jump in school history.Now, if that doesn’t scream 
best male athlete of the year then I don’t know what does.
Jordan: Dendy had a great 
season, and he is deﬁ  nitely a competitor.
But Dukes had the better all-
around outing this year.
The Miami native ran a sub-20-
-second 200-meter dash not once, but twice during the outdoor sea-son — becoming the ﬁ  rst UF ath-lete to do so while in college. 
The second time he accom-
plished the feat, it lifted him to a ﬁ  rst-place ﬁ  nish at the NCAA 
Outdoor Championships and 
gave him the fourth-best time in NCAA Championship history.
And what makes Dukes’ per-
sonal-best run more outstanding is that it came just 40 minutes after running the anchor leg of Florida’s ﬁ  rst-place 4x100-relay team.
Dendy’s two titles at the 
NCAA Outdoors, in comparison, came on two different days, three days apart from each other.
Eden: What Dukes did is as-
tounding. That’s a lot to put on an athlete, but Dendy is the only men’s jumper for Florida. He carries the weight of two entire 
events.
His ability to carry the events and place ﬁ  rst in nine of his meets 
is a testament to Dendy’s success this year.
He’s the best not only because 
he doesn’t crack under pressure, but also because he can produce, which is hard to ﬁ  nd in athletes 
now.
The Middleton, Del., native 
didn’t falter all season but instead 
got better with each meet.
Let me also add that while this 
is the category for best male ath-lete for the year, it was Dendy’s best year yet in the triple jump with him breaking his personal 
bests. 
I would say that he had a great 
year on his long jump, which is 
totally true, but his 2013 season surpassed 2014.
Jordan: Dukes may not have 
— to use your words — carried the weight of events on his own like Dendy did, but he still com-
peted in six events throughout 
the season. 
During the indoor campaign, 
he ran the 60-meter dash, the 200-meter dash and the 4x400 relay. Once the outdoor season kicked off, Dukes ran on both the 4x100 and 4x400 relay squads in addi-tion to the 100- and 200- and 400-
meter dashes. At different points in the year, 
he competed in three different 
events on the same day. That puts some serious wear-and-tear on your body.
And he got even better once 
the championship season rolled 
around. 
Outside of his 14th-place per-
formance in the 60m prelims at 
the SEC Indoor Championships, Dukes ﬁ  nished in the top four in every meet when it counted.
That’s coming in clutch.Eden: Dendy’s season was just 
as lucrative as Dukes, if not bet-
ter. 
The jumper broke the long 
jump record in the outdoor 
NCAA meet on June 12. The last time it was broken was in 1993 by Dion Bentley. That seems like a big deal to me.
He’s one of the ﬁ  rst athletes 
people think of when you men-
tion track and ﬁ  eld and that’s be-
cause he’s done some incredible things. Breaking records is just one of them.
Also, Dendy is just a junior at 
UF. If he’s breaking records and grabbing national titles like this now, imagine what the upcom-ing season will be like for him 
and the Gators.

Gordon Watson closed out the 2013-14 sea-
son on a hot streak.
The rising junior won his final two singles 
matches in the NCAA Tournament before No. 
14-seeded Florida was ousted in a 4-3 decision by third-seeded Ohio State in the Round of 16.
His hot streak continued into the summer 
as he won the singles competition in the 2014 Gainesville ITA Circuits Draw on Monday at the Ring Tennis Complex.
Watson, the top seed in the circuit draw, 
won the circuit by defeating sophomore and teammate Oliver Landert — the No. 5 seed in the draw — in three sets (2-6, 6-0, 10-5). 
Two other Gators also competed in singles 
action during the three-day tournament.
Florida commit Chase Perez-Blanco — the 
fifth-ranked recruit in the state of Florida ac-cording to tennisrecruiting.net — reached the semifinals before losing to Watson 3-6, 6-0 
(8).
Sophomore Josh Wardell won his first 
three matches — dropping just one set in the 
process — before falling to Perez-Blanco in 
the quarterfinals 2-6, 6-4 (5).
In doubles action, UF’s two pairings 
reached the finals, with Watson and Landert 
teaming up against Perez-Blanco and Wardell. The latter took the crown, winning the match 
6-3.
Perez-Blanco and Wardell lost just one 
game before heading into the finals in their two matches heading into the finals.
“It was good to see our guys compete this 
week,” UF men’s tennis coach Bryan Shelton said in a release. “It was a tough format and there was a lot of tennis played. I was pleased 
to see our guys tough it out and win two titles in this heat. The best teams in the country play the most tournaments in the summer months. 
Our guys know they have one more month to 
prepare before school starts.”
On the women’s side of the draw, Kourt-
ney Keegan was the lone UF representative and did not disappoint in her singles play.
The No. 2 seed in the circuit, Keegan won 
her first three matches in straight sets to ad-
vance to the semifinals where she ultimately 
fell to Stetson commit Alizee Michaud — the No. 14 player in the 2014 recruiting class ac-cording to tennisrecruiting.net — in three sets (3-6, 6-2, 12-10). 
The Roswell, Ga., native finished her fresh-
man season as the ITA Southeast Region Rookie of the Year after compiling a 31-11 singles record, reaching as high as the No. 3 
court in dual matches during her first year at 
Florida. 
She ended the season ranked No. 71 in the 
ITA Singles Rankings, second only to Brianna Morgan (No. 19) for returning UF players, 
and peaked at No. 34.
In doubles play, Keegan won a team-best 
32 matches, including a 16-3 record in dual 
matches.TUESDAY, JULY 29, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

ASSOCIATED PRESS
COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. — 
Frank Thomas choked back tears, 
Joe Torre apologized for leaving people out of his speech and Tony La Russa said he felt uneasy.
Being enshrined in the Hall of 
Fame can have those effects, even on the greats.
Thomas, pitchers Tom Glavine 
and Greg Maddux, and managers Bobby Cox, Torre and La Russa were inducted into the baseball shrine Sunday, and all paid spe-cial tribute to their families be-
fore an adoring crowd of nearly 
50,000.
“I’m speechless. Thanks for 
having me in your club,” Thomas said, getting emotional as he re-membered his late father. “Frank Sr., I know you’re watching. Without you, I know 100 percent I wouldn’t be here in Cooperstown 
today. You always preached to 
me, `You can be someone special if you really work at it.’ I took that to heart, Pop.”
“Mom, I thank you for all the 
motherly love and support. I know it wasn’t easy.”
The 46-year old Thomas, the 
first player elected to the Hall 
who spent more than half of his 
time as a designated hitter, batted .301 with 521 home runs and 1,704 RBIs in a 19-year career mostly with the Chicago White Sox. He’s 
the only player in major league 
history to log seven straight sea-sons with a .300 average, 20 hom-ers, 100 RBIs and 100 walks.
Ever the diplomat as a man-
ager, Torre somehow managed to assuage the most demanding of owners in George Steinbrenner, maintaining his coolness amid all 
the Bronx craziness while keeping 
all those egos in check after taking over in 1996. The result: 10 divi-sion titles, six AL pennants and four World Series triumphs in 12 years as he helped restore the lus-ter to baseball’s most successful franchise and resurrected his own career after three firings.
Torre, the only man to amass 
more than 2,000 hits (2,342) and win more than 2,000 games as a manager, was last to speak, and in closing delivered a familiar mes-sage.
“Baseball is a game of life. It’s 
not perfect, but it feels like it is,” said the 74-year-old Torre, who 
apologized afterward for forget-
ting to include the Steinbrenner family in his speech. “That’s the magic of it. We are responsible for giving it the respect it deserves. Our sport is part of the American soul, and it’s ours to borrow - just for a while.”“If all of us who love baseball 
and are doing our jobs, then those 
who get the game from us will be 
as proud to be a part of it as we were. And we are. This game is a gift, and I am humbled, very humbled, to accept its greatest honor.”
The day was a reunion of sorts 
for the city of Atlanta. Glavine, Maddux and Cox were part of 
a remarkable run of success by 
the Braves. They won an unprec-edented 14 straight division titles and made 15 playoff appearances, winning the city’s lone major pro-fessional sports title.
“I’m truly 
humbled to stand here before you,” 
Cox said. “To 
Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux, and I have to 
mention the third member of the big three - John Smoltz - I can hon-estly say I would not be standing here if it weren’t for you guys.”
Smoltz, part of the MLB Net-
work telecast of the event and eligible for induction next year, flashed a smile in return for the compliment.
Glavine started when the 
Braves won Game 6 to clinch the 1995 World Series, pitching one-hit ball over eight innings in a 1-0 victory over Cleveland. And the slender lefty was one of those rare 
athletes, drafted by the Braves 
and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League.
“I had a difficult choice to 
make, and as a left-handed pitch-er I thought that was the thing that would set me apart and make baseball the smartest decision,” Glavine said. “Of course, I always 
wondered what would have hap-
pened had I taken up hockey.”
“In my mind, since I was draft-
ed ahead of two Hall of Famers in Luc Robitaille and Brett Hull, that obviously means I would have been a Hall of Famer in hockey, too,” Glavine chuckled as the crowd cheered. “But I’m positive 
I made the right choice.”
The 48-year-old Maddux went 
355-227 with a career ERA of 3.16 
in 23 seasons with the Braves, Cubs, Padres and Dodgers and ranks eighth on the career wins list. He won four straight Cy Young Awards in the 1990s and won 15 or more games for 17 
straight seasons with his pinpoint 
control.
“I spent 12 years in Chicago, 
11 in Atlanta, and both places are very special,” Maddux said. “Without the experiences in both cities, I would not be standing here today.”La Russa, who ranks third in 
career victories as a manager with 
2,728, behind only Connie Mack 
and John McGraw, was chosen manager of the year four times and won 12 division titles, six pennants and three World Series titles in stints with the White Sox, Oakland A’s and St. Louis Cardi-nals.
La Russa spoke from the heart. 
There was no written speech.
“It’s uncomfortable because 
I didn’t make it as a player. Not even close,” said La Russa, who made his big league debut as a teenage infielder with the 1963 Kansas City Athletics and ap-peared in just 132 games over six seasons, hitting .199 with no home 
runs. “Since December, I have not 
been comfortable with it. There’s no way to mention everybody, and that bothers me.”
“From managing parts of two 
years in the minor leagues, after thinking about all the other young managers who paid a lot of dues in the minor leagues and I get a 
chance and then I go into the big 
leagues with three organizations,” he said. “All that equates to me is I’m very, very fortunate. I’ve nev-er put my arms around the fact that being really lucky is a Hall of Fame credential.”

UF coachHe looked back to his normal self 
against Kentucky, running for 176 
yards and a touchdown. That was only two weeks before his injury against LSU. Having been cleared 
since May 1, Jones will see a healthy 
fall camp for the ﬁ  rst time since his true freshman season in 2012.
Redshirt freshman Adam Lane 
had a surprisingly decent spring, gaining 64 yards on 12 carries in the Orange and Blue Debut. Because three veterans are in front of Lane on the depth chart, he might not see much action during the season. But he can give quality reps if absolute-
ly necessary.
Early enrollee running back 
Brandon Powell could also see 
some reps if he has some impres-sive plays in fall camp. Powell did not participate in spring practice due to a foot injury he suffered while still in high school. 
He had surgery on the foot 
shortly after he arrived on campus in the spring. He will likely redshirt given the depth Florida has at run-ning back, but Powell certainly has the talent to see playing time if he 
impresses early in fall camp.
This group of running backs is 
the deepest Will Muschamp has 
had in his four years in Gainesville. With his ground-and-pound phi-losophy and Kurt Roper calling the plays this fall, the Gators could surprisingly be one of the most productive rushing offenses 
in the conference.
as he disrupted the Chicago 
Bears’ offense throughout the Week 11 matchup.
With Ihedigbo signing 
with the Lions this offseason, 
Elam can return to the posi-
tion he dominated during his time at Florida. As a result, the 22-year-old has the poten-tial to have a breakout season in 2014.
Jordan Reed vying for 
Pro Bowl: Washington Red-skins’ tight end Niles Paul is 
convinced former Gator and 
fellow teammate Jordan Reed will become a Pro-Bowl tight end in 2014.
“That’s a Pro Bowl tight 
end right there,” Paul said after practice Friday to the Washington Post. “Mark my words: He will be a Pro Bowl-
er.”
After totaling 499 yards  
and recording 45 receptions, 
which ranked second on the team, Reed will have the op-portunity to extend his play-making skills under new Washington head coach Jay Gruden.
Although he had an injury-
shortened rookie campaign, the former Florida tight end understands the Redskins have big plans for him on of-fense.However, Reed has de-
cided to not wear a special protective helmet despite suf-fering a season-ending con-cussion against the Philadel-phia Eagles during Week 11.
Mike Pouncey’s return 
date extended: Miami Dol-phins’ center Mike Pouncey, who was already going to be sidelined for the beginning of the 2014 season due to hip surgery, is now expected to be out for the ﬁ  rst half of the year.
Pouncey’s rehab from a 
torn labrum in his hip was originally predicted to last until September. However, the former Florida center is now projected to miss the ﬁ  rst eight weeks of the year. 
Because the Dolphins have 
a bye week in early October, 
Pouncey would miss seven 
games if the timetable is cor-rect. 
Aside from being physi-
cally immobile to practice at training camps, Pouncey is also dealing with a legal situ-ation off the ﬁ  eld.
A lawsuit was ﬁ  led on Fri-
day concerning a club ﬁ  ght involving both Mike and Maurkice Pouncey on July 12.
But according to SI.com, 
the brothers were not men-tioned in the incident report.16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 29, 2014

pretty good atmosphere “
Smith, the ﬁ  fth-ranked outside linebacker 
in the country, is friends with fellow Peach 
State linebacker Adonis Thomas (6-foot-3, 219 pounds, Lawrenceville, Ga., Central Gwinnett 
High), who is announcing his commitment on Friday. 
Thomas is deciding between Florida and 
Alabama. Smith said the decision will be a partial factor in his commitment.“I’d love to play 
with him, but at the end of the day you 
have to do what is best 
for you,” Smith said.
Smith said his visit to Gainesville will be the last one he will take before his senior sea-
son starts in August.
“It’s a nice city of Gainesville, good camara-
derie of the players and the coaches are pretty good people,” he said. “So I enjoy it every time I come out.” RECRUIT , from page 13Taylor looks to lead group of tailbacks
