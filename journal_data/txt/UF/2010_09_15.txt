UF has again been highly 
ranked among the country’s 
most prestigious universities, 
this time in a worldwide study comparing the quality of re-search produced by 1,000 uni-versities.
A new study by the Univer -
sity of Western Australia ranks the top 500 universities of the world in terms of research per -
formance, and UF ranked 50th. 
The study measures perfor -
mance based on the number of publications produced and sub-sequent citations and references 
of those publications.
Winfred Phillips, UF’s vice 
president for research, said he 
was pleased with the recogni-
tion, especially because of what 
it says about the university’s faculty.
“It represents the quality of 
our faculty,” he said.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando 
said the ranking speaks to the value of the university’s work.
“I think this is good recogni-
tion that the work we do at the university in research is impor -
tant and useful,” he said.
Phillips attributed the rank-
ing to the university’s diversity 
and breadth of academic study, as faculty members from a vari-
ety of programs are able to con-duct research.
The scope of the university’s 
research is what attracts quali-fied faculty, Phillips said.
“It’s a place where people 
want to work,” he said.
The top 50 schools on the list 
are mostly dominated by North American universities, with Harvard University, Stanford University and Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology occupy-
ing the first three spots.
Phillips said the recognition, 
along with the presence of UF 
faculty at national and interna-
tional academic conferences and 
meet-ings, can be used 
to recruit 
faculty and students.
“It might help us attract in-
ternational graduate students,” he said.

say a woman stripped in the back seat of a 
cab, demanded the driver take her to her home state of Michigan and when he refused, stole his cab.
Covington Police Capt. Jack West told The 
Times-Picayune that the driver picked up 29-year-old Jennifer Gille of St. Clair Shores, Mich., about 1 a.m. Sunday. 
West says Gille refused to get out when 
they reached their destination, stripped and demanded the cabbie take her home.
West says the driver went to a police sta-
tion for help and when inside, Gille drove off.
Police found the cab parked about a block 
away and Gille was still naked. 
Police booked her on charges of unauthor -
ized use of a movable vehicle and obscenity.
She was released from jail late Tuesday 
on a $75 signature bond.

Florida wide receiver Chris Rainey, 22, was arrested 
early Tuesday morning and charged with aggravated 
stalking after sending a text message to a woman he 
had been dating on and off for the past three years that 
said, ‘Time to die bitch.’
A representative from the Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Office said Rainey, who made his first court appearance 
via closed circuit television, has been released from cus-
tody. Judge Denise R. Ferrero ordered him to have no contact with the woman and to be home from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. while the case is pending, unless he is working or at a school function. The next court date has not been determined.The alleged victim asked the judge to drop the 
charges, but the state attorney’s office will still inves-tigate the matter. Rainey was represented by a public 
defender in his first appearance.
“[The woman] has basically ex-
plained that the whole situation was 
blown out of proportion and she did 
not want him arrested in the first 
place,” Chief Investigator for the State Attorney Spencer Mann said. “So her 
wishes are to not press charges.”
Going forward, the firm Johnson 
and Osteryoung will represent Rain-
ey. Huntley Johnson, an attorney who has represented several UF athletes, is hopeful that his client can over -
come the incident.
“For him to be charged with a felony is probably a Gators’ Rainey arrested

A Gainesville man accused of a No-
vember kidnapping and burglary was sen-
tenced to 40 years in prison at a Tuesday 
hearing. 
Reynard Mosley, 20, was convicted of four counts of armed robbery and four counts of kidnapping, according to Spen-cer Mann, public information officer for 
the State Attorney’s office. 
Mosley, along with three other men 
armed with pistols and shotguns, ap-
proached the two victims who were mov-
ing furniture into their Lakewood Villas home, according to the 
report. 
The burglars, con-
cealing their faces with masks and wearing cot-ton gloves, forced the two 
victims into the home. There, they found four other people, including 
two children and their babysitter, accord-ing to the police report.
The burglars then bound the four older 
victims with duct tape and forced them to lie on the floor. The men held guns to the victims’ heads as they shouted their de-mands for money.
The burglars are accused of stealing 
more than $300 in cash, a cell phone and a PlayStation 3, according to the police re-port. Local man gets 40 years for kidnapping, burglary

 The game, known to followers as 
HvZ, involves groups of students play-ing as humans and zombies. 
The humans use Nerf guns and 
balled-up socks to defend themselves from being tagged and transformed into a zombie.
As of Tuesday afternoon, 850 stu-

“There’s a lot of new freshmen and upperclassmen participating in this round who heard about the game from the mini-game in the summer,” HvZ 
player Anthony Cardona said. 
“We don’t want people to say, ‘oh, it’s

happened, and we offer our deepest condolences to [Mares-co’s] family and the brothers of 
Sigma Chi, said Senate president 
Kara Olesky, who represents the Unite Party.
“He is a role model to many 
people.” 
The resolution will be sent to

Gainesville is sponsoring a contest 
for residents to show how they see the 
community – not just with their eyes but through their lenses. 
The second annual Gainesville Photog-
raphy Contest is a competition open to amateur and professional photographers to depict their perspective of the city. 
The Gainesville Communications office 
and the Cultural Affairs division initiated the contest as a way to give residents a community-building project that will get 
their minds off daily life, explained Laura 
Rawson, marketing and communications assistant at the communications office. 
“We hope to get people to put their 
troubles on the back burner,” she said. 
The photographs should address the 
theme “Gainesville in Motion” and any of six categories, including “on the move,” “time to work, time to play,” “forces of na-
ture,” “energy in motion,” “seniors on the 
move” and “living la vida loca.” 
“This is definitely an innovative city, so 
we always seem to be on the move,” Raw-son said. 
Although the judges dictate the catego-
ries and do not allow any digital manipu-lation of the photographs, they encourage creativity in the entries. 
“It could be [a picture of] someone rid-ing their bike or it could be a picture of 
a bike,” she said. “We don’t want to put 
limitations on the artists.”
Last year’s winner, Hugo Cruz, a local 
artist who works in the mediums of pho-
tography, acrylic paint-ing and metal art, used a near-infrared filter on his camera to block most humanly visible light 
and photographed Cen-
tury Tower in downtown 
Gainesville. 
“It’s an iconic struc-
ture, and it represents what I like about Gainesville most: Not only its historical architecture but also the incredible arbo-real feel of the city,” he said.  
Cruz, a UF alumnus, explained that the 
contest allows photographers with all sorts of experience “to use their hidden talents to put their own spin on Gainesville.”
No more than 500 photographs will be 
judged, and the submission deadline is Sept. 30. 
The 20 finalist photographs will be 
on display at an exhibition at the Hip-
podrome State Theater in January, and 
the grand-prize winning photograph will be unveiled by Gainesville Mayor Craig Lowe and printed in the upcoming 2010 
Citizen’s Report.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — A slowly emerging econom-
ic recovery, spending cuts and more federal stimulus dollars 
have helped cut a potential shortfall in next year’s Florida budget by more than half to $2.5 billion, a state economist said Tuesday.
Gaps of up to $2.8 billion and $1.9 billion are forecast for 
the following two budget years. Lawmakers must figure out ways to eliminate the gaps because the Florida Constitution requires a balanced budget.
Legislative economist Amy Baker said nearly $800 million 
in spending cut from the budget for the current fiscal year, which began July 1, were a big factor in reducing next year’s gap. The economic recovery, although uneven, also helped.
“The recovery probably overall is very fragile,” Baker said. 
“Florida’s a diverse state so you are going to see some areas recover quicker than others.”
The outlook does not include tax losses due to the Gulf 
of Mexico oil spill, which won’t be calculated until later this year. They are no longer expected to in the billions — “huge, frightening, terrifying numbers” — as originally feared, Baker told the Legislature Budget Commission.After hearing Baker’s testimony, the panel adopted a re-
vised long-range outlook that reduces an anticipated gap between general revenue and spending deemed critical and high priority to $2.5 billion for 2011-12. It could shrink even more — down to $828 million — if lawmakers fund critical spending needs but not those considered only high priori-ties.
The panel also put $1.3 billion in additional stimulus 
money from a recently passed federal jobs bill into the current year’s budget, now topping $71 billion. Florida received an 
unexpected $554.8 million for public schools and $855 million for Medicaid.
The Medicaid money will supplant state 
dollars already appropriated for the program 
that provides health care to needy and disabled people.
The budget includes contingency provisions for spending 
part of the freed-up state Medicaid dollars but most will be held in reserve. That has also contributed to narrowing next year’s budget gap.
There’s no contingency plan for the education windfall, 
which increases state public school spending about 3 percent and must be passed on to local school districts.
Senate Ways and Means Chairman JD Alexander, R-Lake Wales, said he hopes districts can save some of it for next year when the stimulus program expires and Florida faces “an in-credibly challenging budget outlook.”
Federal law says it must be spent in the current budget 
year for rehiring laid off teachers and staff and other person-nel expenses, but Alexander said that should free up state and local money, which can be saved.
Wayne Blanton, executive director of the Florida School 
Boards Association, said he supported Alexander’s idea but it may not be possible. It depends in part how federal education officials interpret the law and on negotiations with teachers unions that have seen members laid off and go without raises, Blanton said.
Republicans have a majority in the Legislature and on the 
budget panel. It approved the additional federal dollars with-out debate although GOP gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott has said Florida shouldn’t accept stimulus money.
The panel’s chairman, Sen. Rudy Garcia, a Republican 
from Hialeah and Scott supporter, defended the stimulus spending.
“Rick Scott and I need to have some more discussions on 
critical need issues that were helped by the stimulus dollars,” Garcia said later. “There are particular families and children and people on Medicaid that have received help — critically needed help.”

� THE PROCEEDS WILL HELP PAY 
HER MEDICAL BILLS.
By KAT BEIN
Alligator Staff Writer
When Lauren Ault “started to see 
clouds,” along with the vomiting and daily migraines, her mom, Ellen, begged the eye doctor to take a look at her daughter.
After the doctor saw her, Ault was rushed 
to Shands at UF for emergency surgery. The doctor had found a brain-stem tumor that had grown undetected for eight years.
Now, almost three years after her first surgery, it takes Ault, 23, two minutes to 
walk across her ten-foot-wide living room 
with a walker and an hour to get dressed 
without assistance. 
She sees a speech therapist and a physi-
cal therapist three times a week and has had 
four brain surgeries and four stomach sur -
geries in the past two years.
On Sept. 29, Ault’s friend and former 
occupational therapist, Megan Molyneux, 
is hosting a 5K run at Haile Plantation Vil-
lage Center, and proceeds will go to Ault’s 
family to help pay for some of her medical 
bills and construction of proper wheelchair 
access to her house.The run will begin at 7 p.m. and fea-
ture appearances from Gators coaches and surprise guests, a live band, food, beer and 
wine.
Participants can register at Laurensan-
gels.com, named for the angels Ault paints 
each week in therapy.
Racers who register before 
Sept. 21 will receive a free din-
ner and a Lauren’s Angels T-shirt. Registration is open until 
the day of the run.
Ault, who remains in good spirits and is 
hopeful she will one day be “normal” again, will take the first steps of the race.“She’s been through more than most of 
us will go through in a lifetime,” Molyneux said.
Before the doctor found the tumor, Ault 
dreamed of becoming a model or actress and was studying theater at Santa Fe College. 
Since that first surgery, her plans have 
changed, but her aspirations aren’t very dif-
ferent from those of other 23-year-olds.
 She just hopes to be able to finish school 
and one day work with people who may 
need her help.
“Something to where I can be a thera-
pist,” Ault said. “I’ll know what they’ve 
been through.”5K race to raise money for former Santa Fe student

31% YES69% NOTuesday’s question: Are you confident about your job prospects after you graduate?Today’s question: Would you rather be a human or a zombie? Veiled in shame
Less than two days af-
ter Muslims across the globe celebrated the 
cancellation of a scheduled Quran burning in Gainesville, 
France stepped into the anti-
Muslim arena as it banned “concealing the face in the public sphere,” a clear refer -
ence to the Muslim burqa. 
Well, at least we gave Mus-
lims two days to savor the small victory in Gainesville, but the effects are already be-
ing felt in France. 
After the French Senate 
voted to ban the face veils 
with only one dissenting vote Tuesday , the Eiffel Tower and surrounding areas were evac-uated after a bomb threat was reported. French police say the two events are reportedly 
completely unrelated. 
Supporters of the ban on 
face veils in France say the ban, if left unchallenged by 
French courts, will prevent men from forcing their wives into submission and allow for greater freedom.
Opponents of the law deny 
these claims, saying it will only force Muslim women to stay inside rather than be seen in public without a veil.
Although we are whole-
heartedly opposed to any type of sexism, which sup-porters of the ban suggest this 
law will prevent, we also sup-
port freedom of religion, and we recognize that a majority of Muslim women do not see face veils as a form of volun-tary submission. 
We must stop trying to im-
pose our Western-European views of justice on the entire 
world and realize this law is 
the best example of ethnocen-trism at work. Everybody 
hates Chris
Gators athletes should

It’s not like we didn’t see this one coming. 
And it’s not like we didn’t even warn them with their 
very own precautionary dart during the first week of the fall 
semester.   In fact, it would probably be fairly accurate to say we were waiting for this to happen.  
UF wide receiver Chris Rainey apparently didn’t listen to us. 
Tuesday morning, Rainey was charged with aggravated stalk-ing, which we can only take to mean he kept “liking” the wom-an in question’s Facebook default over and over again. 
Rainey, whose charge equates to a third-degree felony, might 
just get a little lucky though, as the woman he apparently stalked wants the charges dropped.  
And why wouldn’t the charges be dropped? It’s not like of-
fenses were ever that serious.  
Rainey just sent a sexy text message to a woman he has re-
portedly “had a long-term relationship” with that said “Time to die bitch” among other sweet whisperings. 
We’re just glad some people have the sense of humor to not 
take life-threatening text messages seriously . Finally , a woman who can laugh in the face of danger. 
But in reality , we’re not even disappointed in our football 
team anymore. 
We’ve come to expect the daily update on our Google alerts, 
informing us of another Gators linebacker or fullback who got the book thrown at him for whatever felony he committed this time.  
It’s time to crack the whip, Urban.  Because we don’t throw 
darts frivolously . And we can’t be held responsible for those who choose not to listen to our warnings. 
Good luck with those felony charges, Chris.  Time to pray . 
Facebook oversharing is dangerous
The sense of college is invoked when certain words 
are uttered. Degree. Campus. Quad. Facebook. 
The social networking giant is having a ban-
ner year. It surpassed more than 500 million active users this year, and the Aaron Sorkin movie documenting its founding debuts in two weeks. All is well in Facebook land, right? Wrong. 
With the addition of Facebook Places, Facebook’s 
own location-based network, the social networking site’s privacy woes grew even larger. Not only can you now see where your friends went to party Friday night via their pictures, videos, wall posts and comments, 
but now you can actually see when they check-in, stop 
studying and join them. Sounds awesome, right?
It is. It’s in the vein of other location-based social 
networks, primarily Foursquare, which provides its 
users with incentives like badges and mayorships for 
checking in a certain number of times in a time period or checking into a location repeatedly. The idea isn’t a bad one, but the execution is.
I like Facebook Places and Foursquare a lot. Perhaps 
I’m a nerd who just likes telling people where I am and making them feel guilty for staying in their dorm. But I’m also into common sense. 
I never check into a location-based social network 
with a location too specific. When I’m checking into my dorm, I check into the building, not my room number. When I’m in the Reitz Union, I’ll check into the Reitz Union and not the restaurant or ballroom I’m in.
Why care so much? The New York Times reported 
Sunday three burglars robbed houses based on Face-book updates. Nothing else. Not unlocked front doors or anything that would traditionally lead to a robbery. So should an Average Joe or 
Jane stay off Facebook Places and Foursquare? Of course not. But the 
key is to use common sense and 
ensure where you’re checking in is large enough or vague enough to ward off potential criminals who 
may be interested in your stuff or, 
worse, you. Just like you wouldn’t 
tag yourself in a picture of a keg stand before your pro-fessional interview, you shouldn’t be checking in at an incredibly detailed locations.
I know it’s funny to change your roommate’s profile 
picture or update his or her status with something ri-diculous when they’re out of the room or away from the keyboard, but location-based social networking status-
update abuse (a mouthful, eh?) should be considered a 
major-league party foul. 
You might as well take a megaphone, go to the Plaza 
of the Americas and scream out your roommate’s name, date of birth, major, debit card information, UF ID num-
ber and social security number. You’re putting your 
roommate and yourself at risk. 
Don’t allow anyone to update location-based social 
network check-ins or places but yourself. It’s a simple 
rule that saves a lot of headaches, fights and embarrass-
ment in the future.
Now my only wish is the characters in “The So-
cial Network,” Aaron Sorkin’s movie about Facebook, would check in at some of those parties in the commer -
cial. Those seem pretty sick.

letters@alligator.orgWEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 7
Earlier this week, I stumbled upon an opinions piece on 
USAToday.com titled, “Spirituality can bridge science-
religion divide.” Boiled down, it seems to be trying to 
say that science and religion can get along just fine if religion 
leaves the picture.
Seriously, that’s how the author comes across. He seems 
to want people of faith to keep their faith, if they so choose, but ditch fundamentalist religion. He might not be entirely 
wrong, but I don’t think he’s entirely right, either. It’s treading 
on old ground, but it’s still worth noting that religion itself is not at war with science, nor should it ever be. As a Christian 
that’s fairly fundamentalist (to the point that I believe much if 
not all of the Bible contains a great deal of historical accuracy), I’ve never had problems with ideas like evolution or the big 
bang.
Now, that’s not to say I’m entirely accept evolution yet, but 
it doesn’t affect my faith in the least if it’s 100 percent true or not. Scientists aren’t out to disprove God – or if they are, 
they’re severely misguided. Science’s goal is to figure out how the universe works and then to apply that knowledge 
to make our planet a better place to live. Nothing about that 
goes against the teaching of the Bible, nor, to my knowledge, many other spiritual texts.
That said, religion today – Christi-
anity definitely included – is extremely flawed. Churches all over the world 
have done very bad things in the name of God, Allah, etc. I 
can see why some people would be all for ditching organized 
religion altogether and going the “spiritual” route. But in my humble opinion, we should try to fix the problems before 
ditching the practice entirely. With the resources available to 
organized religion, a lot of good could be done for the world. We could cure AIDS, shelter the homeless and feed the hun-
gry. Science could gain much more from a partnership with 
religion than it could from people who are merely spiritual – a term I’m sure a lot of agnostic people would apply to them-
selves. Now, I’m definitely not saying there’s anything wrong 
with going the spirituality route in your personal life. That’s perfectly fine, and the day may come when I leave Christian-
ity and follow Christ on my own terms, as it were. Maybe give 
religion a better chance. 
The USA Today column, all told, doesn’t feel terribly bal-
anced. The author spends a lot of time talking about how New Atheists, like Richard Dawkins, are fine with “spirituality,” and how even people who don’t believe in a deity can have it. Therefore, it doesn’t seem to make the case for religion being 
OK with science so much as it seems to ignore religious peo-
ple altogether. Not that Richard Dawkins really understands religion, anyway. That man is a pretty smart scientist, but he’s 
one of the worst philosophers I’ve ever read.
I know this imaginary war between science and religion 
isn’t going to end any time soon, and that’s a major bummer. However, I don’t think that means we have to immediately 
toss one side or the other into the trash. Not all religious people will boo Bill Nye the Science Guy for saying that the 
moon only reflects light. I would bet a great deal of money 
that those sorts of religious people make up a very, very small portion of the population. Likewise, not all science-minded 
people are like Dawkins, anxious to destroy religion and all it 
stands for. Those numbers, too, are probably pretty low in the grand scheme of things. Why can’t we all just play nice with 
each other?
Regardless, the time hasn’t yet come to toss religion out 
the window. I worry that such an action would create far more problems than it would solve.

SAN BRUNO, Calif. — The tragic ex-
plosion of a gas pipeline in a San Francisco 
suburb has shed light on a problem usu-ally kept underground: Communities have expanded over pipes built decades earlier 
when no one lived there.Utilities have been under pressure for 
years to better inspect and replace aging 
gas pipes — many of them laid years be-
fore sprawling communities were erected 
around them — that now are at risk of leaking or erupting.
But the effort has fallen short. Crit-
ics say the regulatory system is ripe for problems because the government largely leaves it up to the companies to do inspec-tions, and utilities are reluctant to spend the money necessary to properly fix and 
replace decrepit pipelines.
“If this was the FAA and air travel we 
were talking about, I wouldn’t get on a 
plane,” said Rick Kessler, a former con-gressional staffer specializing in pipeline safety issues who now works for the Pipe-line Safety Trust, an advocacy group based in Bellingham, Wash.
Investigators are still trying to figure 
out how the pipeline in San Bruno rup-tured and ignited a gigantic fireball that torched one home after another in the neighborhood, killing at least four people. Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the pipeline’s owner, said Monday it has set aside up to $100 million to help residents recover.
Experts say the California disaster 
epitomizes the risks that communities face 
with old gas lines. The pipe was more than 
50 years old — right around the life expec-tancy for steel pipes. It was part of a trans-mission line that in one section had an “unacceptably high” risk of failure. And it was in a densely populated area.
The blast was the latest warning sign in 
a series of deadly infrastructure failures in recent years, including a bridge collapse in 
Minneapolis and a steam pipe explosion 
that tore open a Manhattan street in 2007. The steam pipe that ruptured was more than 80 years old.
The section of pipeline that ruptured 
was built in 1956, back when the neighbor -
hood contained only a handful of homes. It is a scenario that National Transportation Safety Board vice chairman Christopher 
Hart has seen play out throughout the na-tion, as suburbs have expanded.
“That’s an issue we’re going to have 
to look on a bigger scale — situations in which pipes of some age were put in be-
fore the dense population arrived and now the dense population is right over the pipe,” he said.
Thousands of pipelines nationwide fit 
the same bill, and they frequently experi-ence mishaps. 
Federal officials have recorded 2,840 
significant gas pipeline accidents since 
1990, more than a third causing deaths and 
significant injuries.
Hart said the tragedy in San Bruno 
could push other states to begin tougher inspections of their lines.
“It would surprise me if other states 
didn’t see this and learn from it and be proactive with it,” Hart said.
Congress passed a law in 2002 that re-
quired utilities for the first time to inspect pipelines that run through heavily popu-lated areas. 
In the first five years, more than 3,000 
problems were identified — a figure Weimer said underscores the precarious pipeline system.
Even when inspections are done and 
problems found, Kessler said, there is 
no requirement for companies to say if 
or what kind of repairs were made. And Weimer added industry lobbyists have since pushed to relax that provision of the law so inspections could occur once a de-cade or once every 15 years.
Other critics complain that the pipeline 
plans are drafted in secret with little op-portunity for the public to speak out about 
the process. 1,000 HAVE BEEN 
DEPORTED SO FAR.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
BRUSSELS — France’s deporta-
tions of Gypsies are “a disgrace” 
and probably break EU law, the European Union’s executive body declared Tuesday in a stinging re-
buke that set up a showdown with 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy’s conservative government.
In recent weeks, French authori-
ties have dismantled more than 100 illegal camps and deported more than 1,000 Gypsies, also known as Roma, mainly back to Romania, in a crackdown that has drawn inter -
national condemnation.
EU Justice Commissioner Vivi-
ane Reding said she was appalled by the expulsions, “which gave that impression that people are being removed from a member state of the European Union just because they belong to an ethnic minority.”
This “is a situation that I had 
thought that Europe would not have to witness again after the sec-ond World War,” she told a news conference, adding “the commis-sion will have no choice but to 
initiate infringement procedures 
against France.”
France could ultimately be 
slapped with a fine by the Euro-pean Court of Justice if its expul-sions are found to have breached 
EU law.
The crackdown continued Tues-day, as a chartered Airbus took off 
from the southern city of Marseille for Bucharest with 69 Roma on board, police officials said. Like others repatriated by France, they 
received a stipend of up to $385 per 
person for resettlement.
At Bucharest’s Baneasa Airport, 
Argentina Rosca, 30, seven months pregnant with her sixth child, lugged a huge bag as she exited the airport.
“It’s good to be back because 
my children are here,” she said.
Alexandru Musa, 37, had been 
in Marseille for three months working in construction, earning $1,300 a month under the table. He said he would return to France: “I earned good money and I was happy there.”
Roma face widespread discrim-
ination in housing, jobs and educa-
tion across Europe. As EU citizens, 
they have a right to travel to France but must get papers to work or live there in the long term.
The advocacy group Romeu-
rope estimates that up to 15,000 Roma live in France. French au-thorities have no official estimate.
Sarkozy has linked Roma to 
crime, calling their camps sources of prostitution and child exploita-tion. He has insisted that France does not want to stigmatize Roma, but the deportation policy is being criticized as discriminatory because it singles out one community.
Interior Minister Brice Hor -
tefeux defended the policy in 
France’s National Assembly on 
Tuesday.“We do not evacuate ... illegal 
camps because they are Roma’s, 
we dismantle them because they 
are illegal,” he said.
Reding at times appeared angry 
as she read out her statement at the European Commission’s Brussels headquarters, once pounding the 
desk in front of her and saying: 
“Enough is enough.”
“After 11 years of experience on 
the commission, I even go further: This is a disgrace,” she said. “Dis-crimination on the basis or ethnic 
origin or race has no place in Eu-
rope.”
Sarkozy’s office refused to com-
ment on Reding’s statement.8, ALLIGATOR  WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 2010

UF FOOTBALL
� GATORS FACE THE NO. 1 TAR 
HEELS ON SUNDAY.
By JAIME MANHEIMER
Alligator Writer
 
The No. 5 Gators kicked off the first 
game of their vigorous five-game road trip 
with a thrilling overtime victory , beating FSU 2-1.
“It was an amazing experience,” captain 
McKenzie Barney said. “We got our focus back together in the huddle before over -
time started and we said ‘Let’s just take a deep breath, refocus, and go out there and do this.’ So after about five or six passes,  I 
got a beautiful cross and finished.”
This season, the Gators have been much more comfortable late in games, out-
scoring opponents 8-2 in the second half. Barney , the Gators’ leading goal-scorer this 
season, has scored four of her five goals in 
the second half or overtime. 
Barney scored the game-winning goal 
Friday just 15 seconds into overtime, earn-
ing her a second Southeastern Conference 
Offensive Soccer Player of 
the Week award. 
Florida now prepares 
for its most challenging test, 
traveling to No. 17 Duke be-
fore taking on No. 1 North Carolina, the two-time de-
fending national champions. 
“It’s the perfect time right now (to play 
these teams),” Barney said. “We’re ready. UF ready for toughest 
challenge of season“Time to Die Bitch u and ur???”
With that text message, 
Chris Rainey re-opened the 
floodgates.
Just as the distinguished sandwich 
thrower, tow company crusader and 
sleepy drunken driver before him, Rainey has ensured that the tradition of memo -
rable and stupid arrests of UF football players lives on.
It’s not as much about what Rainey 
did as how he did it.
This is a spat that really never should 
have seen the light of day. Rainey and the alleged victim have been romantic in the past, he wanted her attention, she didn’t 
provide it, and he flipped out.
He sent the above text along with some other less-serious 
threats until the police were called, and we’re off to the races.
The ex-girlfriend 
said in court Tues-day that she nev-er feared Rainey would harm her and that she didn’t want charges pressed against him, anoth-
er sign that this isn’t that big of a deal.
Plus, Gainesville attorney Huntley 
Johnson, who represents most legally-
challenged UF football players and   Chalk up another memorable arrest

The Southeastern Conference doesn’t have much of 
a scouting report for Tennessee junior quarterback Matt 
Simms, who transferred to UT from El Camino (Calif.) Com-
munity College after beginning his college career at Louis-
ville.
But Florida defensive end Justin Trattou knows exactly 
what to expect. 
Trattou grew up down the street from Simms — son of 
former New York Giants quarterback Phil and brother of former Texas Longhorns and Tampa Bay Buccaneers quar -
terback Chris — in Bergen County, N.J., where the two were 
teammates at Don Bosco Preparatory High School. 
“I know his style of play, but obviously he’s playing in a 
system at Tennessee so he’s going to do what they tell him to 
do,” Trattou said. “Matt’s a really talented quarterback. He has a great arm, and he can throw with the best of them so 
we’re going to have to watch out for that.”
The Gators expect the V olunteers to try to run the ball 
down their throats with tailback Tauren Poole, who rushed 
for 162 yards on 23 carries last week against Oregon. But de-fensive line coach Dan McCarney said Simms could still be 
a factor. 
“They’re going to take a lot of shots downfield,” McCar -
ney said. “Simms has got a really strong arm, and we’ve got 
a good inside scouting report there with Justin Trattou being his high school teammate. It’s not only what we see on tape, 
but we know the strength of his arm, the talent and the unbe-
lievable family tradition of success at quarterback.”
Mum’s the word on Rainey: Only offensive coordinator 
Steve Addazio commented on wide receiver Chris Rainey’s Trattou gives Gators inside look at QB Simms
Today’s question: Do you think Chris Rainey 
will play another game for the Gators this season?
Vote on alligatorSports.orgWEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 15
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF will face No. 17 Duke and No. 1 North Carolina this weekend. The Gators have excelled late in games this season 
as they have outscored opponents 8-2 in the second half.
seemingly sports a winning percentage 
that would make Urban Meyer blush, is now handling the redshirt junior wide-out’s case.
Hopefully, Rainey — who I’ve always 
thought of as a pretty nice, funny dude — will put this behind him and get his career back on track. And there’s no reason to think he can’t.
The bigger issue is how this looks from 
afar.
It doesn’t matter whether charges are 
dropped. What matters is public percep-tion, and like most crimes the Gators have 
been accused of in recent years, this one 
stands out. 
As this story broke Tuesday, I got plen-
ty of text messages from friends inform-ing me that it was “time to die.” In jest, I hope.
It made the rounds quickly, and those 
three (or four) words are bound to follow Rainey around like his last two quotable 
moments: “It’s good to be Chris Rainey” 
and “I’m a white girl man” (He held true to that second quote with this incident, by the way).
And when you factor in the rest of that 
text, it gets even worse. I’m not saying the threat is OK, but what is going on with the back half of his message? Is he asking a question? 
Are the question marks an invitation to 
fill in the blank?
Or maybe, as one person suggested on 
Twitter, Rainey was trying to type “Time to dine” and auto-correct screwed him up.
It’s easy to joke about, and that’s the 
point. 
Expect a few wisecracks if you make 
the trip to Knoxville this weekend (sugges-tion for Vols fans: print a shirt depicting a Chris Rainey-themed clock with “Die” written in place of all 12 numbers).
The more outlandish the arrest, the 
more it will be remembered. Here, we have a threat suited to the end of a cheesy action flick with awful spelling and grammar.
And that gives the Gators — not to 
mention the university — a terrible name.
Depending on whose count you go by, 
the football team has had between 20 and 4,000 arrests under Urban Meyer. That’s 
obviously an exaggeration, but this has 
been a problem for a while.
Two things have kept Florida’s reputa-
tion from really going in the toilet: win-ning and Tim Tebow. Tebow’s gone, and winning may be taking a sabbatical, so there are fewer places to hide the dirt.
It’s a crucial time for Florida to keep its 
nose clean.

Florida shot its lowest round of 
the season Tuesday.
Propelled by junior Evan Jens-
en’s two-under-par 70 and sopho-
more Mia Piccio’s third straight 
round with at least four birdies, the Gators carded a one-over 289.
“We had four pretty solid 
rounds today,” coach Jan Dowling 
said. “It was definitely more like 
us.”But the effort wasn’t enough 
to prevail at the Cougar Classic 
in Hanahan, S.C., as the No. 19 
Gators finished in fifth place at 875 
(292-294-289, +11). North Carolina 
won the tournament with a team 
score of 860 (285-285-290, -4).
UF excelled on holes 15 through 
18 this week, shooting 17 birdies 
in the four-hole stretch.
“We got into the mix in the 
third part of our round,” Dowling 
said. “We just couldn’t quite finish it off.”
Jensen jumped six spots into a 
tie for eighth and was one of two Gators to finish in the top-10 in in-dividual scoring. 
“She’s been hitting the ball well 
ever since she got back to school,” Dowling said. “The putts just started to drop for her today.”
Her 54-hole score 
of 216 (73-73-70, E) is 
a career best. 
Piccio, leading the 
Gators in individual 
scoring entering the day, bogeyed three 
of her first six holes. But she rolled in three birdies on the back nine to recover and finish in a tie for sixth at 215 (70-72-73, -1). 
“She feels like she’s really close to breaking through and shooting a really low number,” Dowling 
said. 
Junior Andrea Watts looked like 
she would be the one going low 
when she opened her round with back-to-back birdies at five and 
six. But a double bogey dropped 
her back, and she finished with an even-par 72 for a 54-hole total of 221 (74-75-72, +5).
Senior Jessica Yadloczky again 
shot 74 and finished in a tie for 29th (75-74-74, +7).
Dowling said there’s still room 
for improvement.
“If we look at our putting, I think everyone felt like we left a lot out there,” she said. “We’re go-
ing to be able to come away from 
this tournament knowing exactly what we need to work on.” 
The Gators’ next chance will 
come Sept. 24 at the Mason Ru-
dolph Women’s Championship 
hosted by Vanderbilt at the Leg-ends Club in Franklin, Tenn. The tournament routinely draws some of the top teams from across the 
country.
“It’s probably one of the best 
fields of the year,” Dowling said. 
“I look forward to seeing how we stack up.” Late push helps Gators to top-five tournament finish 
Florida looks to play two-touch soccer, move the ball around quickly
We’ve had some tough opponents up to this point, but it’s 
nothing like what we are going to see this weekend. So hope-
fully we are peaking in the right spot and we come into this 
weekend fully prepared.
“My personal goal for the weekend is to come out with 
two wins and stay undefeated.”
Remaining focused has been a motto for the undefeated 
Gators this season, and coach Becky Burleigh has preached 
for her team to stay relentless during the tough road trip.
“For both games, our focus is on continuing to do what 
we did well, along with putting the ball in the back of the net,” Barney said.
“We need to capitalize on our opportunities and make 
sure we are finishing our chances. That’s been a big thing for us this season. We just want to play as a team and do what-
ever the coaches tell us to do.”
And even though UF has yet to lose, the team’s room for 
improvement reads like a laundry list.
“We just want to continue to get our rhythm in terms of 
our offense because I think we play very much in a rhythm,” 
Burleigh said. “When we play one and two touch we are a 
much better team than when we hold onto the ball a lot.”arrest for aggravated stalking Tuesday. 
“Chris Rainey is not a part of our team 
right now, and that’s really all I have to 
say on that,” Addazio said. 
Addazio refused to say anything else 
about how the situation is being handled 
and asked that all questions be directed 
toward the Tennessee game. 
When asked if freshman Robert Clark 
would be the player to receive an in-
creased role in the offense in Rainey’s ab-
sence, Addazio again kept it short. 
“Right now we’re getting ready for 
our Tuesday practice. ... All those things would be premature right now,” he said. 
When Rainey left Saturday’s game 
against USF with a concussion, Clark subbed in and had one catch for 15 yards, a crossing-route play that drew praise from teammates and coaches.
“He’s just a hard worker,” running back Jeff Demps said of Clark. “No mat-
ter what coach tells him to do, he’s going 
to do it. No arguing, 100 percent, and you 
know he’s going to work really hard.”
Nixon back to 100 percent: The Gators 
may finally have the pieces of their offen-
sive line in the right places. Tackle Xavier 
Nixon said he’s fully recovered from the 
knee injury that caused him to miss the 
season opener. He played 
sparingly last week as a 
blocking tight end.
“It felt like a sense of 
knocking the dust off, get-
ting back right,” Nixon 
said. “I really haven’t played full-contact 
ball since the spring, so it feels good to get 
back.”
If Nixon starts at left tackle, Marcus 
Gilbert would likely move back to right 
tackle and Maurice Hurt would slide in-
side to guard. That was the expected line-
up before Nixon’s injury.

“We need to play with a little more attention 
on defending set pieces and deal with playing

UF junior Chris Rainey was arrested and charged with aggravated stalking on Tuesday 
morning after sending threatening text messages to a woman.
Rainey’s status on team unknown
little overblown,” Johnson said. “I’m cau-
tiously optimistic that it will be worked out in such a fashion the he and the young 
lady in question can get on with their lives 
and have this be just a small bump in the 
road.”
  Rainey has either been “removed from 
the team or suspended indeﬁ  nitely” by the 
Gators, Johnson added.
  According to the police report, the inci-
dent began when Rainey texted “you don’t 
care about me” to the alleged victim at 10:30 
p.m. on Monday after she did not answer 
his phone call. She responded by telling him to go to bed and leave her alone.
  Instead, Rainey showed up at the wom-
an’s house and continued to call and text her until she threatened to notify the au-thorities.
  At 11:47 p.m., the victim went outside 
and noticed Rainey was gone, according to 
the report. Thirty-ﬁ  ve minutes later, he sent 
the offending text message.
  Following the threatening message, she 
called the police.  When she told Rainey that law enforce-
ment ofﬁ  cers wanted to talk to him, he re-
plied, “wait and see what happens when 
they leave,” the report states.
  Rainey denied making the comments on 
the phone, but he did admit to sending the “Time to Die Bitch” text message. 
  A call to a UF spokesman seeking fur-
ther comment was not returned.
  Rainey, who has caught six balls for 34 
yards this season, suffered a concussion against South Florida on Saturday but was expected to play against Tennessee this 
week. His status for the Gators’ upcoming 
game is still unknown.
  “Mr. Rainey is a tough young man,” 
Johnson said. “He’ll be ﬁ  ne.” RAINEY , from page 1THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
    
 NEW YORK — Reggie Bush 
says he is forfeiting his Heisman 
Trophy.
  The New Orleans Saints’ run-
ning back released a statement Tuesday saying he would give back the award that he won in 2005 
while at Southern California.
  It’s the ﬁ  rst time college foot-
ball’s top award was returned by a 
recipient.
  “While this decision is heart-breaking, I ﬁ  nd solace in knowing 
that the award 
was made pos-sible by the sup-port and love 
of so many,” Bush said. “Those are gifts that can never be taken away.”
  USC was hit with heavy sanc-
tions by the NCAA this summer af-ter it determined Bush had received improper beneﬁ  ts. The NCAA 
ruled that Bush was ineligible for 
the 2005 season, which opened the possibility that the Heisman Trophy Trust would take back the award.
  One of the few guidelines given 
to Heisman Trophy voters is that a player must be in compliance with NCAA rules to be eligible for the trophy.  Bush returns tainted Heisman Trophy amid controversy   
“She has basically explained 
that the whole situation was 
blown out of proportion and she 
did not want him arrested in the         
ﬁ  rst place.”
