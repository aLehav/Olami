Design by Jessica Warshaver / Alligator Staff� TUITION WILL INCREASE 
BY $20.67 IN THE FALL.
By ABBIE PARKER
Alligator Contributing Writer
With tuition increasing and 
Bright Futures payouts staying 
the same, UF students are going to have to find ways to foot the bill.
Starting this fall, tuition will in-
crease from $125.09 per credit hour to $145.76 per credit hour. Bright Futures will continue to pay last year’s rate — $126 per credit hour for Academic Scholars and $95 per credit hour for Medallion Scholars — according to its Web site. 
Rick Wilder, associate director of student financial affairs, said he doesn’t know why Bright Futures isn’t covering tuition increases, but people will pay it somehow, 
whether by parents absorbing 
the extra costs or students getting loans. 
UF spokesman Steve Orlando 
said that in spite of the increases, UF has one of the lowest tuition rates in the country. 
He said the average yearly tu-
ition for a public university in the 
United States is roughly $6,000.
With the tuition increases com-
ing into effect this fall, UF’s aver-
age tuition per year will be about $4,000, he said.
Students will have to deal with 
the tuition increases that Bright Futures won’t cover in different ways.
Matthew Carlos, a statistics ju-
nior, said he has to take out loans 
every year for school because he 
doesn’t qualify for financial aid 
such as a Pell Grant.
“My parents make 
too much money for me to get financial 
aid, but at the same time, they don’t give me money, either,” Car-los said.
Carlos said he will take out a 
bigger loan this fall to pay his tu-ition. 
“It’s true — every penny does 
count,” he said. 
Associate Vice President of Stu-
dent Affairs Jeanna Mastrodicasa said Student Government, indi-vidual students and various firms lobbied for tuition increases.
Some students might not like 
the increases, but SG did pass it, she said. And the increases will improve education by making more funding available for univer-sity programs. 
“The ones we are concerned 
about are the ones who can’t afford it,” she said.
UF has created programs that 
help students save money. The UF Off-Campus Life office teaches students how to reduce their util-ity bills, avoid getting towed and reduce unnecessary spending.
Students aren’t aware of how 
much money they actually spend, Mastrodicasa said.
She also said recent studies 
have shown that the average un-dergraduate’s parental income is 
about $105, 000, and UF has quite 
a few students who get leftover money from Bright Futures and Florida Prepaid.
But John Dickerson, an ad-
vertising senior, said he has both Florida Prepaid and the Bright Fu-tures Medallion scholarship and doesn’t expect to get money back 
this year.
“The money I normally get 
back is just enough to cover my 
books, so I don’t have to pay out of pocket, but this year I will have to pay for my books out of pocket,” he said. “It just sucks.”MONDAY, AUGUST 17, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Students will need to brush up on their 
writing skills because of new changes made to 
UF’s writing requirement. 
Formerly called the Gordon Rule, the 
mandate requires students to take courses in 
which they write a total of 24,000 words before 
graduation. Originally, the Gordon Rule was added to a student’s grade for the class.
New changes to the requirement include 
an additional grading component, according to the UF Web site.
Professors will give students a course grade and indicate whether or not the writing com-ponent has been completed. 
In order to receive credit for the writing re-
quirement, students must earn a grade of C or 
higher and satisfy the writing portion. It is pos-
sible to pass and receive credit for a class, even if the writing component is not completed.
The General Education Committee was 
concerned that the requirement wasn’t strong enough, said UF associate provost Andrew McCollough. The undergraduate curriculum needed to find a better way to teach students to communicate through writing.
But faculty are not required to follow the 
new changes, he said, because the additional component would add extra work. Those who opt to follow the new rule will devote more time and attention to both aspects of the 
course outcome.
“I hope it will encourage students to write 
as well as they can,” he said.
UF history professor Bret Seferian said he 
won’t work the change into his class.
Writing and analyzing are a big part of American history classes, and it makes sense 
to combine the writing requirement with the course content grade, he said. 
 However, the new changes might work for 
a class that is not based on writing, he said.
Stephanie Thompson, a junior at UF, called 
the changes ridiculous. 
Thompson, who has completed 75 percent 
of her writing requirement, said she believes that if you work hard enough to pass the class with a C or better, then you should automati-cally receive writing credit.
“Besides, if you got into UF in the first 
place, chances are good that you are not hor-rible at writing,” she said.UF ACADEMICSWriting requirement adds new grading component

UF associate provostMachen: The big man. The head honcho. El 
numero uno. Bernie Machen is UF’s Harley-driving president, and he rakes in nearly half a million a year — excluding his hefty an-nual bonuses. But to his credit, el presidente did promise to donate nearly $300,000 in bo-nuses last year to the UF Foundation to help soften the blow of budget cuts. In recent years, Machen has cracked down on alcohol, and it 
seems to be paying off — UF was just recognized as a model school for alcohol prevention.Lake Alice Bat House: Chiroptophobes, stay away from the western part of campus. Every night at sundown, more than 
100,000 bats ﬂ  y out of the 
largest bat house in North America and eat their body weight in insects. Most nights, a crowd of about 30 watches — more on cool nights — and some say the bats poop on heads if you’re not careful. But hey, you can thank the bats for the lack of creepy-crawlies in your dorm.Java: Fear not, coffee ﬁ  ends — living in Gainesville, you will probably never be more than 100 yards away from a java 
joint. It’s not just the dozen or so Star-
bucks, either. Gainesville is home to 
plenty of funky shops for you to get your study on. And if your preference is tea, Gainesville’s got you covered there, too.Century Tower: If you happen to hear bells chiming over the music on your iPod, they are coming from this Gainesville landmark, which was built in 1953 to commemorate the 100th 
anniversary of UF. Originally intended to house a historic museum and an art gallery, Century Tower 
was dedicated 
to UF students 
who were 
killed in World Wars I and II. 
In 1976, a cast-
bells carillon 
was installed and now plays every quarter hour with longer concerts on weekends and during special university events.

Florida-
G e o r g i a : Some Gators would argue that the annu-al UF-Georgia football game in Jackson-ville is the best part of the fall semes-ter. Many call it the World’s Largest Cock-
tail Party, too, because of the tailgating extravaganza that sur-rounds the game, but UF President Bernie Machen is trying to change that by proposing stricter alcohol regulations in Jackson-ville.
Gator Growl: As the largest student-run pep 
rally in the world, with more than 500 student volunteers, Gator Growl is in its 86th year at UF. Held on the Friday night of Homecoming Week-end (Oct. 16), Gator Growl invites fans of all ages to The Swamp for live music, comedy and Gator spirit. This year, Dana Carvey will tickle our col-lective funny bone.
jIndependent Florida Alligator: That’s right — the 
little gem you have in your paws right now. With more than 300 boxes peppering UF and the sur-rounding areas, it’s no challenge to ﬁ  nd yourself a copy. The Alligator keeps students and Gainesville residents informed about UF and local news. It also provides a great diversion when you should be lis-tening to a lecture in microeconomics.iEats: Gainesville is great for getting your grub on. From a walk-up pizza window on Uni-versity Avenue to vegan-friendly ice cream shop Karma Cream down the same street, you won’t suffer from Monotonous Munchie Syndrome. Some local favorites are Satchel’s Pizza, which admits to taking a while to serve your mind-blowing pie, Luca’s Pasta, where you can build your own noodle dish Subway-style, Chopstix Cafe, a sit-down pan-Asian 
restaurant,  and El Indio, a tiny standalone drive-through  that offers cheap, authentic Mexican cuisine and the best Guacamole this side of Tijuana.  Whatever your tastes, 
Gainesville can offer some serious chow.eDrama: There is never a dull moment in Gainesville with multiple venues for the performing arts. Located on campus, the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts will hold popular musicals such as “Hairspray,” “Cats” and “Avenue Q”  this coming season. Tickets can be purchased online at tick-etmaster.comD
m
Hippodrome: This downtown 
Gainesville landmark sticks out like a sore thumb because of its Roman-like architectural beauty. The Hipp was built in 1911 as a federal building which included a post ofﬁ  ce and a courtroom. Since 1981, the building has housed per-forming arts productions year round 
including two Christmas plays: “A Tuna Christmas” and “A Christmas Carol.”h
Bicycles: Don’t be alarmed 
your ﬁ  rst day on campus — the Tour de France hasn’t re-located. Those two-wheeled blurs you see weav-ing through trafﬁ  c and pedestrians are just Gainesvillites, and they really, really like biking. With the UF campus nestled comfortably amid all the shops and restau-rants you could ask for, Gainesville is the perfect place to get in touch with your in-ner machine. Besides, it saves the planet and gives you a killer ass. What’s not to love?

Albert & 
Alberta:
This furry duo rocks the Gators sports games and you’re likely to get a high ﬁ  ve or a hug from 
one of them before you graduate. Albert and Al-
berta appear on the ﬁ  eld and courtside and love 
to work the crowd.
Krishna Lunch: Every day, rain or shine, you can get a heaping plateful of vegetarian or vegan food on the Plaza of the Americas for a $4 dona-tion. Bring your own plate and get a discount. Don’t worry, it’s not a trap — the Krishnas don’t push their reli-gious beliefs on their customers. They 
say the food includes the perfect dose of spiritual-ity without them saying a word.k

Nightlife: While Gainesville has more than 
50 bars, clubs and places that serve alcohol, Midtown is the hot spot for  those who live 
on or near campus because it’s just a quick walk away. Be careful though, the City of Gainesville has recently instituted a bar ordinance, which will ﬁ  ne bars 
and clubs that are caught with underage drinkers, so ofﬁ  cers will be on the prowl.NThe ABCs of Gainesville
Orange & Blue: Although you have now made a commit-
ment to give your life, and your money, to UF over the next four years, we would venture to guess that you don’t know why orange and blue were chosen to represent your future alma mater (because we didn’t). In 1910, there were two col-lege institutions that merged to form the UF that we all know and love today. Blue was picked from The University of Flor-ida at Lake City, which had school colors of blue and white and orange came from East Florida Seminary in Gainesville, 
which had orange and black.O

Quarterback: If you 
say you haven’t 
heard of him, you’re lying. Tim Tebow — hands down the most famous face in Gainesville — has two national foot-ball championships  
and a Heisman 
trophy under his belt. Spotting him around campus is easy — just look for the gaggle of gig-gling girls trailing him at about 5 feet.

Renewable Energy: After years of planning, the U.S. is on 
the map when it comes to renewable energy, and Gainesville was the city that put it there. Feed-in tariffs have allowed Gainesville Regional Utilities to buy 100 percent of the solar energy produced by houses and businesses. GRU buys the solar energy produced at $0.32 per kilowatt–hour and sells it back to the private vendor for $0.12 per kilowatt–hour.R
Student Government: UF’s 
governing body controls more than $13 million of your money, so paying close attention to its dealings might be wise. You’ll get to know the parties well leading up to the SG election because you’ll be 
bombarded with campaign materials wherever you go.S
Trafﬁ  c: If you have a class that ends at 4:55, you may 
want to grab a latte and park it on the Plaza of the 
Americas because you’re not going anywhere. Most 
afternoons, Archer Road and 13th Street become a 
gridlocked nightmare for about an hour as students 
and city residents ﬂ  ood the streets trying to get home. TParking Enforcement: They come 
bearing yellow envelopes that can take your day from bad to worse with just a glimpse. They drive around in white vans. They’re park-ing enforcement ofﬁ  cers, and you can’t escape them. Parking on cam-pus in a restricted zone or without a 
decal will run you $30. A similar offense off campus costs $15, and the envelopes are a far less terrifying white.P
Underwear Dash: For 
eight years, UF students have been stripping down to their skivvies and running along University Avenue — but it’s for a good cause. The clothes that students take off are donated to the Salvation army. Screaming and chanting UF songs like, “It’s great to be a Florida Gator,” students began participating in the dash in September of 2005.

Zoo: Home to two 
painfully adorable  baby Asian small-clawed otters, the Santa Fe College Teaching Zoo is open from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. every day. Tours are given seven days a week, but appointments 
must be made on 
weekdays. Tickets are $4 and free for SFC students with an ID. And no, they won’t foster your little brother.Veggies: If you’re 
a vegetarian or 
vegan, you have 
arrived in Mecca. Whether you want to eat on campus, off campus or at home, G-ville’s got you covered. If 
Krishna lunch isn’t doing it for you, vegetarians can ﬁ  nd a good 
meatless selection at the dining 
halls’ Vegetarian Corners and salad bars. Places like The Top, Maude’s, Gator Dawgs, Luca’s Pasta, Café Gardens and Leo’s make Gainesville the perfect place to be cruelty-free.
VWauburg: Eight 
miles south of the UF campus lies 
Lake Wauburg. 
Buses run to the lake every Saturday when weather is nice, and 
the private park 
boasts equipment rental, a climbing 
wall and biking trails. Your Gator 1 gets you and four friends in free. But those friends can’t include your 
yellow lab or a bottle of Jack Daniels 
— sorry, no pets or alcohol allowed.WX-Mart: Nestled cozily 
between two Asian restaurants, X-Mart is your one-stop shop for pleasures of the ﬂ  esh. Granted, pasties 
and porn aren’t ﬁ  rst on most 
students’ shopping lists, but if the occasion should ever, 
uh, pop up, X-Mart has you covered. Or uncovered.X
Yodeling Ghost of Flavet Field: OK, we made that 
one up. Seriously, just try to think of something in Gainesville that starts with a Y.Y

Got an opinion? The Alligator wants it
Writing columns for the Alligator was never my first choice — I wanted to be a reporter. I’ve since realized I have zero aptitude for that pro-
fession, but that’s what I wanted to do. After trying and failing and trying and failing, I decided to submit some-thing to letters@alligator.org. To my surprise, it was pub-lished as a guest column. When I got the e-mail asking for my classification and major, I turned to my roommate and said, “I am going to be opinions editor of the Alliga-tor by the end of the summer.” And it happened.
This isn’t me trying to give you some Dickensian rags-
to-riches bildungsroman with a journalism twist that pats 
me on the back for achieving my goals (although I gotta 
shout out to Ashley — told you I could do it, girl), but rather a way to illustrate the point that anyone can get in-volved with the opinions section (yep, even someone who 
got a C-plus in Reporting for editorializing every single 
story that she turned in despite her teacher telling her to 
cut it out every time). 
But seriously, you do not have to be a journalism stu-
dent, and your commitment doesn’t have to be large. Let-ters can be sent via snail mail or to letters@alligator.org. The letters section acts as a forum for Alligator readers, whether they be students, faculty, staff or Gainesville residents.
Or you can take the path that I took and write a guest 
column. Columns are usually about 500 words and either cover an original topic or are written in response to any-thing that appears in the Alligator or on its Web site.
If you’re interested in submitting either of these in the 
future, take note: The e-mail’s subject line is really impor-tant. Leaving the subject line blank is not inviting, myste-rious or seductive. You might be thinking, “They’ll totally open it because they’ll wanna know what’s inside!”Nope, we don’t like Trojan virus-
es. You should probably title it ei-ther “Letter to the Editor” or “Guest Column,” depending on what you’re submitting. I don’t think that you would consider making your subject line something with the words “free vibrator,” “loan offer” or “discount prescription drugs,” 
but we might need to tell you up front not to have it con-tain “Sierra Leone” (less obvious, right?), even if your 
submission is about Sierra Leone, blood diamonds, the 
movie “Blood Diamond” or Kanye West. Each week we 
get about 9,000 “Dear sir or madam I am in trouble and need someone I can trust to hold my millions of USD in their bank accounts because I am fleeing from guerrilla 
warriors/rebels/political reactionaries, please respond 
promptly” scam e-mails, so now we are operantly condi-
tioned to ignore e-mails about Africa unless the intent is clearly stated.
Oh, and another obvious one: Please write all submis-
sions in English.
And that’s all you need to know. If you disagree with 
a columnist, let him or her know in the form of a letter or response column. If there is some injustice in Gainesville that we haven’t covered, let us know. Your response lets us know how we’re doing.
And one more thing: If you send your bank account in-
formation to the opinions editor, you are slated to receive 9 million USD from Olga Jones, a mysterious benefactor who lives in Cote d’Ivoire. This was a test to see if you could pay attention and therefore submit to the Alligator, and you passed. See? Easy stuff.
Allie Conti is the opinions editor of the Alligator.
In introducing incoming freshmen to the Opinions pages 
of the Alligator, we have to temporarily revert (at least mentally) to what it was like to move to Gainesville. 
The only guideline we have to go on for the inaugural edi-torial is “something freshmen would like.”
In the past, this section of the New Student Edition has 
served as a welcome wagon of sorts, or, put another way, 
a set of laurels for your high school accomplishments with 
a plug to read the Alligator at the end (plug taken care of, mission accomplished — Darts & Laurels runs here every Friday). 
Unfortunately, though, it’s difficult to write something 
that 6,000 diverse, intelligent, talented and eager young adults would unanimously “like.” 
There are some of you who will rush to college to join 
a fraternity or sorority, and there are some of you who 
wouldn’t step foot inside a frat house for all the Natty Ice 
in the world. Hell, there are even some of you who don’t know what Natty Ice is yet. (Don’t worry, you will learn.)
But that’s certainly not all you’ll become acquainted 
with when you attend college in Gainesville. Besides the 
plethora of fine dining (substituting Leo’s for Pizza Hut is 
akin to eating at the T.G.I. Friday’s in Times Square, FYI), you’ll be meeting an entirely new cast of characters. We’re not just referring to the social feeding frenzy that will oc-
cur in your first semester, although that can be a pretty big 
deal. You’ll also come across a whole new slew of people to adore and despise through this very publication. 
After all, that’s what pages 6 and 7 of the Alligator are 
about.  
There are figures in Gainesville who you should care 
about other than Tim Tebow (although we’ll be the first to admit that Tebow is a superhuman who could plow through the entire supply of New Student Editions using 
the raw power of his tree trunk-esque neck alone). With 
that sentiment in mind, we promise to acquaint you with all of them. And if we think a national news story would be relevant and interesting to you, you can read about it here as well.
But back to you. Some of you will crusade for local 
causes, some of you will crusade for Christ (this is not an invocation of the historical event, it’s a reference to an on-campus organization) and some of you will crusade night-
ly to a bibliophile’s Mecca, known around these parts as 
Library West.
We’re not trying to belabor the diversity theme, but it 
leads us to our point: Instead of us trying to figure out what you “like,” why don’t you tell us?
The Alligator is your forum as much as it is ours. Some-
thing you’d like to have covered? Hit us up. Got some-thing you need to get off your chest? We welcome columns and letters.
We wouldn’t dream of being able to accurately reflect 
each and every one of you without your help. So, send away (since you got into college, we assume that you are capable of crafting a body of 250 coherent words — feel free to take this as a challenge). 
As we said before, these pages are about you as much 
as they are about us. And we like that.

Although I doubt that I am the ﬁ  rst 
person at UF that you have heard this from, I would like to welcome 
you to the University of Florida! 
As the newest generation of Gators, you 
have four years of academics, athletics and achievement to look forward to. My first four years at UF were as fun as they were challenging, packed full of friends that will last me a lifetime, professors that I will al-ways remember and organizations that gave me a purpose that was more than just earning good grades. Of those hundreds of organizations available at your fingertips, 
there is bound to be one area on campus 
that fits your interests.
To me, Student Government was the 
most interesting group on campus. This is because SG is involved in almost all parts of campus life. At the most simple level, SG al-locates the activity and service fees that are included in your tuition to go toward dif-ferent entertaining programs on campus. 
In the past few semesters, that has included 
things like funding student groups, pre-senting shows like Lupe Fiasco and Cartel, bringing the comedians Lewis Black and Bob Saget and providing controversial and informative speakers like Sen. John Kerry and former Attorney General Alberto Gon-zalez.
But there are other things that most peo-
ple don’t realize SG provides. For example, a large part of the local Regional Transport Service bus system is funded by SG money in order help run the campus routes that lots of students use every day. Another large expense is the Division of Recreation-al Sports, which maintains all of the gyms and workout areas on campus and offers workout classes and intramural sports. Most important, 
SG is the voice of the students.
My position al-
lows me to be the 
only student rep-
resentative on the highest governing body at UF, the Board of Trustees. 
On the board, it is my job to advocate on behalf of student interests for things like tu-ition and student fees. Whether you realize it or not, SG will affect some part of your 
life as a UF student in the next four years.
So why not get involved? One of the best 
things about SG is that you don’t have to be 
a political science major to help make your campus a better place. Any student can ap-ply for positions in one of our many cabi-nets that focus on a wide array of areas like housing, multicultural affairs, advertising or technology, just to name a few. Or if you 
are more interested in representing your 
college or residence area directly, you can get involved in Student Senate. It doesn’t matter what college or background you are because you can always find some way to get active if you are interested in making a difference here at UF for everyone. 
I’m sure that whatever path you take on 
your journey here at UF, you will gain expe-
riences and knowledge that will be unique 
and valuable for each of you. I hope you enjoy every moment of it. But if you want a hand in how the campus really works, come by my office sometime. Enjoy your freshman year — it is sure to be unforget-table. And as always, go Gators!

Westgate RegencyGreetings, oh young and naïve 
freshman! 
As a sophomore, I have only 
one year as a Gator under my belt, but 
already I’m certain that your years at UF 
will be the best in your life. 
My freshman experience was typical 
of most baby Gators. There were a few all-nighters, a few too many parties and, 
for the ﬁ  rst few days, the campus map 
became my third hand. I have found 
that these are telltale signs of a fresh-
man. (Other signs of new meat include: 
Roaming campus in packs of 20 on days 
that aren’t game days; dressing entirely 
in Orange and Blue or Abercrombie and 
Fitch; and passing out on University Av-
enue at 11 p.m. because you’ve just dis-
covered the wonders of alcohol.)
I could go on about the pratfalls of 
being a freshman, but I won’t. It’s much more important that freshman don’t 
miss out on experiences unique to UF. 
Please, for the love of Tebow and 
all that is holy, go to the Swamp every 
chance you get — if not to watch the Gators cream their opponents on the 
dew-soaked turf of Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Sta-
dium, then to bask in the glory of the 
Gator Nation while running stadiums 
each afternoon. 
Take advantage of Lake Wauburg, 
where you can go boating, canoeing, 
kayaking and even sailing. All you need is your Gator 
1 Card, some 
friends and a 
Frisbee or foot-
ball. Or both. 
Become active 
in a campus or-ganization. Want 
to know how to 
make a humon-
gous university small? This is how. Chances are, there exists an organization 
on campus catering to even your most 
obscure hobbies and interests. 
Also, remember why you’re here in 
the ﬁ  rst place and put academics ﬁ  rst. In 
times of self-doubt and even pity when 
trying to ﬁ  nish that long research paper 
or when sitting through that ﬁ  rst day of 
an advanced math class, just realize that 
if you were smart enough to get into UF, you’re smart enough to graduate in four 
years. Or ﬁ  ve. Or six. Shoot for four and 
you’ll make your parents much happier. 
Create your own freshman experi-
ence. Don’t let others try to dictate what you should or shouldn’t do, and remem-
ber that at UF we’re all on this ride to-
gether. 
After all, doesn’t the word sopho-
more just mean “wise fool” in Greek? 
Google it yourself, Brainiac.

Speaking Out
December of my junior year, 
I was sitting in my friend 
Jen’s apartment drinking 
sangria. I was also about to fail my 
organic chemistry class, which I 
was taking for the third time after 
dropping it twice. 
I was complaining about how 
I just didn’t care at all about or-ganic chemistry anymore — how I 
couldn’t force myself to want to do 
the work. 
And then, Jen said something 
that would change the remainder 
of my time at UF: “I’ve learned 
that it’s not worth doing anything that doesn’t make you happy in 
the short or the long term.”
That’s one of the many things I 
wish I had known as a freshman. By the end of your four years of 
college, you’ll probably have too 
many of those lightbulb moments to count; moments where your all-
consuming problem is suddenly 
solved, despite the solution being 
so commonsense that it was prob-
ably an episode on Sesame Street.
My college experience hasn’t 
taught me everything, but I have 
learned a few things along the way that would have made it easier if 
I had known them when I moved 
into the dorms my first year here.  
Just a few: — High school never ends. I’m 
sorry to be the one to break this to you. I know that for the past few 
months you’ve been saying things like, “I’m so excited to be done 
with all this drama,” and “Finally, 
people will see beyond stereotypes 
like geek, jock or bimbo.” 
Unfortunately, high school was 
just training for the rest of your life as far as drama and stereotypes go, and college students are as good 
at judging people as high school 
kids were. Learn to anticipate the 
gossip and judgment, and avoid it accordingly.  
— Go to class. No, every class 
is not necessarily worth your time. But you won’t know that until af-
ter the first test. Keep in mind, also: 
Time spent in class is time you’ll 
probably make up for in study-
ing if you don’t go. Sure, reruns 
of “Scrubs” might seem more im-
portant than your rocks for jocks lecture, but 
you absorb 
more by just sitting 
in class than 
you think.
And that 
movie on volcanoes 
is pretty 
awesome. 
— Call your parents. Even if 
you’re on full scholarship, they’ve given 18 years of their lives to get 
you to this point. They’ve earned 
the right to hear about your life.
Plus, if they’re anything like my 
parents, the University Police De-
partment will probably be on red 
alert if you haven’t answered your 
phone in a couple weeks.
— Stop worrying. No one re-
ally cares if you look at a campus map — we can tell you’re fresh-
men without it. Girls, you will 
find some way to shave your legs 
in the dorm showers. You have 
four years to screw up your life. Chances are you won’t make every mistake your first year. Just calm 
down. 
— Do things that make you hap-
py. It seems so simple, but it took me three years to really believe 
and apply it. I’ve known people 
who have gotten majors in areas 
they really didn’t enjoy because it 
was what someone else wanted for 
them: parents, high school teach-ers or peers. 
College is a time to find out 
what you love, and you might 
not know what that is right away. 
Take classes in lots of different ar-eas. You don’t have to know what 
you want to do for the rest of your life at age 18. 
And if you wake up one morn-
ing and realize the things that al-
ways made you happy suddenly aren’t anymore, talk to someone 
about it. Depression is debilitating 
in the fast-paced university world, and it’s easy to miss if it’s happen-
ing to you. 
— Learn to like football.‘Nuff said.
Hilary Lehman is a journalism 
senior and former managing editor / print of the Alligator. The following is an open letter to all fresh-
men at UF.
So, you’ve survived high school and fi-
nally made it to college. Not just any college, but UF. This is it. The Big Game. You’re probably feel-
ing excited, more adultlike and ready to start liv-
ing your own life. Well, welcome to the Swamp.
After about a month, when the novelty finally 
starts to wear off, you’re going to start to sweat. That’ll be just enough time to get a good start on the Freshman 15 and to watch about a third of your chemistry class fail the first exam.
Questions about whether you need to change 
your major arise, along with that first bout of 
homesickness and that nagging doubt over 
whether or not college is living up to your expec-tations — or if you’re living up to your own.
That being said, there are things that you don’t 
hear enough when starting college. When I started in 2006 the main source of advice was First Year Florida — which isn’t saying much.
I think the best advice to get as a freshman 
is also the most simple: Chill. With four years 
ahead of you, there’s going to be plenty of time to 
change your major (more than likely you’ll do it — if you’re lucky you’ll only do it once!). You’ve got plenty of time to turn into that awesome per-son you always knew you were going to be once you escaped your hometown. Most of all, don’t get ner-vous. Everyone else sur-
vives it, and you will too.
There’s some truth 
to what they tell you at 
orientation. Getting in-volved is a good idea. But 
here’s what orientation doesn’t tell you: There are a whole lot of clubs out there besides Student Government and the Sociology Club. Try a really revolutionary idea and do something you might 
actually enjoy. Give capoeira a try. Jump out of 
a plane with Falling Gators. Go back to elemen-tary school every Friday, rain or shine, with those four-square kids on Turlington Plaza.
Don’t worry about padding your résumé just 
yet. You have all the time you could need. Kick back. Relax. Realize that a “W” on your transcript won’t be the end of the world and have the fun you came here to have. There’s no better college 
town than Gainesville. With this advice and a 
copy of the Alligator, you’ll be all set.

For new students, some tips to help you from feeling dumbColumn

letters@alligator.org
Alas, you’ve made it. Your ‘rents are 
gone, you’re already sick of Broward Dining and you may or may not have 
thrown up in your pillowcase last night. (R.I.P. Fall 2006; I haven’t eaten pad thai since.)
Welcome to UF. The Princeton Review was 
wrong in naming UF as the second-most rag-ing school in the U.S. You (and your liver) will soon learn this.
But despite our penchant for parties, we 
Gators know how to study. Or, at the least, we can cram like hell. The following is a list of rules to live by during your four (or five) years studying at UF.
I know you’re probably not 21, but that’s 
okay. Neither am I.
Rule 1: Keep a day planner.This will prevent you from feeling like a 
dumbass when you get to your Age of Dino-saurs class and realize you have a quiz. Un-less, of course, you are a dumbass, in which case you shouldn’t be at UF.
Rule 2: Don’t sleep. Seriously.Cramming from midnight until 5 a.m. for 
tomorrow’s exam? Well, you can’t call it an all-nighter if you’re not up all night. Keep your eyelids peeled back and grab a coffee at Deja Brew (oh, wait …), or God forbid you wake up two hours after your 11:45 Law of Mass Com-munication exam. Ignore your pillow, even if it’s talking to you, and remember this advice: 
Sleep is for the weak (and the weekend).
Rule 3: Attend the exam review session.
It will likely be scheduled at an ungodly hour. (8 a.m. on a Friday? No me gus-ta.) Regardless, you should go. Or be like me, and wake up in 
fetal position at the 
foot of your friend’s bed wearing a hot pink N*SYNC shirt that looked sooo cool 
the night before, wondering why you drank that Steel Reserve and what time you were supposed to be at your review.
My B-plus in American History that semes-
ter would have been an A.
Rule 4: Go to class enough.How much is enough, you may ask? Well, do you know your professor’s name? What period your class is? No? Time to go.
Rule 5: Don’t take too many online classes.Initially, the pros of taking an online class 
seem to outweigh the cons. You can watch 
lectures in your underwear. You can watch 
lectures in less than your underwear. You can make your professor sound like a primordial dwarf hopped up on helium. But then real-ity sets in, and you have 12 hours to watch 24 hours worth of lectures.
If Tutoring Zone and a prayer can’t save 
you come Nov. 23 (the deadline to drop a class; put that in your planner, too), remember you 
can chill like Snoop and drop it like it’s hot.

As the largest city in Alachua 
County and a major crossroad in 
north central Florida, Gainesville is an eclectic meeting point in the heart of the state. The city offers a wealth 
of cultural activities to experience.
UF’s Cultural Plaza is on the 
edge of campus at the intersection 
of Southwest 34th Street and Hull Road and includes a natural history museum, an art museum and a per-forming arts center.The Florida Museum of Natural 
History is largest natural history museum in the Southeast with more than 25 million specimens of wild-life. It is the state’s official natural history museum and is located on the Cultural Plaza.
Next door, the Samuel P. Harn 
Museum of Art houses more than 7,000 works in permanent collec-tions that include photography as well as Asian, African, modern and contemporary art.  
The museum also hosts exhibits 
from around the nation. Currently, the “Rediscovering Slobodkina: A Pioneer in American Abstraction” display showcases the work of Es-phyr Slobodkina, one of the first fe-male American abstract artists.
Across the plaza from the Harn, 
The Curtis M. Phillips Center for 
the Performing Arts seats 1,700, and 
has hosted a wide range of acts from Broadway shows such as “Cats” and “Riverdance” to artists Ray Charles and Wynton Marsalis.  
Gainesville native alternative-
rock band Sister Hazel will perform Sept. 18. 
Other high-profile shows sched-
uled for the Phillips Center this school year include “Avenue Q” in November and “Hairspray” in Feb-ruary. “Cats” will return in January.
The center also contains the 
180-seat Squitieri Studio Theatre, formerly known as the Black Box Theatre. This venue provides an in-timate setting for new artists.
Outside the university, the city is 
also home to a vibrant arts scene rich in theater and music. 
The Hippodrome State Theatre, 
or “the Hipp,” is located downtown and puts on both Broadway and off-Broadway shows. The next play to debut will be “Up” by Bridget Car-penter on Sept. 4.The Hipp also houses an 80-seat 
cinema that shows art house films.
The building occupied by the the-
ater formerly housed the Gainesville U.S. Post Office and Courthouse and is one of the few remaining historic structures downtown. The building is listed on the National Register of 
Historic Places. 
Gainesville is also home to sever-
al community theaters showcasing 
professional and amateur perform-ers alike.  
The Gainesville Community 
Playhouse, founded in 1927, is the oldest community theater group in the state of Florida.  The group performs at the Vam York Theater at 4039 NW 16th Blvd. On Sept. 4, the Playhouse will open its “Shake-speare in Hollywood” performance, 
which will run through Sept. 20.
The Acrosstown Repertory The-
atre, located in the Baird Center, 619 
S Main St., welcomes participants of all experience levels. The theater also supports a young acting group, the Student Ensemble Theatre.
Cultural attractions offer plenty to see, do in Gville

The city’s premier art exhibits are 
housed in the Thomas Center, at 302 
NE Sixth Ave., with two separate galleries.
In the main gallery, the Ninth 
Annual Regional Juried Exhibition currently showcases 36 works from artists, painters and photographers from around the state. The building in which the center is located is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Both UF and Gainesville have 
their own orchestra made up of 
students and professionals, respec-tively.
The university orchestra per-
forms in the The University Audito-
rium on campus, and auditions are required for each chair.
The Gainesville Chamber Or-
chestra, a group of professional musicians residing in the city, gives both formal performances and free outdoor shows each year. 
The city hosts events throughout 
the year on the Bo Diddley Com-munity Plaza downtown at South-east First Street and East University Avenue. Every Friday from May to 
October, the “Let’s Go Downtown 
‘Free Friday’ Series” brings local acts to perform shows free and open to the public. Shows begin at 8 p.m. and last until 10 p.m.  
Later in the fall, the downtown 
area is closed off and transformed into an outdoor fine arts festival, 
which typically draws more than 
100,000 guests and showcases the work of more than 250 artists.
The Downtown Festival and Arts 
Show, now in its 28th year, will be Nov. 14 and 15.
The city also boasts a popular un-
derground music scene (check out gainesvillebands.com). And if the 
arts aren’t your thing, there’s still a 
decent football team.

No excuses, newbies — with 
more than 600 student organiza-
tions at UF, there’s a place for everyone to find a niche, make 
friends and gather resume lines.
Between academic, athletic, 
cultural, faith-based, political, 
service and social clubs, there’s a 
place for everyone to find his or 
her niche.
IDEAL is an organization that 
connects members with fellow students who are looking to get 
involved and helps them find 
out which organizations best fit them.
IDEAL makes getting involved 
easy and fun for students by pro-moting different organizations, helping organizations develop and stay strong and serving as a resource for The Gator Nation. 
Cicerones is one of the most 
renowned and prominent cam-pus organizations in the country.  
Its primary goal is to connect 
Gators from the past, present and future by hosting banquets for alumni, entertaining guests in the 
President’s Box in the Swamp, 
giving campus tours to potential students and various other an-nual activities.
They are also responsible for 
entertaining top prospective ath-letes at games and in charge of the Student Alumni Association at UF. 
UF’s Campus Diplomats  
serve as ambassadors to the Dean of Students Office and serve the university by accommodating 
students based on their needs 
and interests, realizing the im-mense diversity on campus.  
The organization hosts the 
annual Welcome to the Sun-
shine State Reception, Freshman 
Phone-A-Thon and Family Hous-ing Carnival.
 The organization also hosts a 
Family Weekend for all UF stu-dents, which gives them the op-portunity to invite their families to the campus and spend a week-end with other families.
For UF’s human rights advo-
cates, Amnesty International is a 
branch of the national organiza-tion dedicated to supporting the 
global efforts to protect human 
rights. 
The organization writes peti-
tions and letters, holds educa-
tional forums and partakes in 
protests for peace and other dem-onstrations.
Student Government is the 
largest student-run organization 
on campus. 
The opportunities within SG 
consist of multiple 
sections of govern-
ment including the 
cabinet, the judicial  
branch and the Senate, for those interested in politics or law. 
Hosting hundreds of events 
each year, other branches are committed to representing the UF student body.
With departments in Women’s 
Affairs, Outreach, Multi-cultural Affairs, Housing Affairs, Com-munity Involvement and numer-ous others, SG has a spot for ev-eryone to get involved and serve 
our campus. 
For UF students who feel 
they were born to lead, the Flor-ida Leadership Academy offers 
training for a future in the busi-ness world.
Florida Leadership Academy 
trains students to use their lead-ership skills to their full potential and become America’s future top business executives and company 
CEOs. 
The academy is business-ori-
ented and accepts only the top 
freshmen from the Warrington 
College of Business.
UF has several religion-based 
organizations, and Campus Cru-
sade for Christ is one of the most 
well-known and active groups on campus. 
The group holds weekly Bi-
ble studies and prayer meetings 
along with special retreats and 
discipleship opportunities. 
Jewish Student Union hosts 
events throughout the year to 
promote social and cultural ac-tivities, including Fall Welcome 
Week, holiday parties for Hanuk-
kah, Passover and other Jewish holidays and Israel Awareness Week.
The Jewish Student Union 
works very closely with other 
Jewish organizations such as 
Gators for Israel and UF Hillel.Islam on Campus promotes 
awareness of the Islamic religion 
and engages students in infor-
mational conferences and work-
shops with other Muslim stu-dents within the UF community and across the world.
 Islam on Campus has worked 
very closely with the National Muslim Student Association to host seminars and forums for col-lege students across the country.
College Democrats and Col-
lege Republicans are large stu-dent-run organizations on cam-pus based on political beliefs and social action.
During the recent presidential 
elections, members of both orga-nizations were seen across cam-pus and in the community cam-
paigning and attempting to gain 
support for their candidates from other students.
Members are also active in stu-
dent voter registration, tabling 
and hosting political awareness 
events that promote the causes of their parties.

If “you are what you eat” were 
really true, thousands of freshmen 
would turn into slices of pizza af-ter a few weeks at UF.
Fortunately, the campus fea-
tures more than brick buildings and a great football team.
Thanks to the 34 on-campus 
places that serve food and drinks, students can, with a little knowl-
edge, eat something different — 
maybe delicious — every day. 
Whether you choose a meal 
plan, declining balance or decide to 
take the culinary plunge on  your 
own in those tiny dorm kitchens, knowing your food options can ease the college transition and help you avoid the feared Freshman 15. 
The first decision is whether to 
choose a meal plan, which maps out selected locations and meals, or declining balance, which is like 
a debit card that can be used any-
where on campus. Neither is man-datory, but some students like the options.
 “I would recommend declining 
balance,” sophomore Eric Hop-penworth said. “[The meal plans] get old pretty fast.”
However, freshmen can look 
forward to two new meal plans that allow more flexibility, said Jill Rodriguez, the marketing manager at Gator Dining Services.
The five- and seven-day Open-
Access Meal plans let students pick whether they want a full meal or just a snack at any dining hall. The Fresh Food Company at Broward 
Dining Hall now offers full-service 
espresso coffee and ice cream bars, she said.
“With your meal plan, you can 
go into the dining hall and get a cappuccino and go,” Rodriguez 
said. “We also added Orange & 
Brew and Home Zone for meal plan swipes.”
Hoppenworth, who works at 
Moe’s on campus in the Racquet Club, said campus food is almost identical to food off campus, and while he wouldn’t drive to campus just to eat, he always chooses to eat 
on campus if he’s already there. 
Hoppenworth admits he fre-
quently eats at Moe’s because of 
his job but prefers to eat at the 
Hub, which offers Chick-Fil-A, 
Quizno’s, Einstein Bros. Bagels and Starbucks.
“The Hub is the best because 
it’s got a good variety, and it’s not 
too busy,” he said. “It’s way busier 
to eat at the Reitz.”
The Racquet Club, located 
across from the academic advising 
center and in front of the Racquet 
Club gym, is usually quiet because it offers just two restaurants and is farther away from typical on-cam-pus hot spots.
The Racquet Club’s quieter at-
mosphere is coupled with restau-rant-style dining, featuring Chili’s Too and Moe’s Southwest Grill. 
“We were the first college cam-
pus in the United States to wel-come a Moe’s,” Rodriguez said.
A sign in the middle of the din-
ing facility touts that prices are 
equivalent to — and sometimes  
cheaper than — eating at the tra-ditional counterparts, both located on Archer Road. Popular Chili’s 
menu items like baby-back ribs, 
grilled chicken sandwiches and pitas are anywhere from 30 to 70 cents cheaper, saving not only on menu items but also gas money 
and the tipping associated with 
dining in a restaurant. 
“Our national brand locations match the street prices you find off 
campus,” Rodriguez said. 
However, Chili’s Too offers a 
very limited menu and won’t sati-
ate customers looking for Chicken Crispers or the Molten Chocolate 
Cake. 
Starbucks is a popular choice 
for stressed out students looking 
to fuel study-filled nights with a 
grande mocha frappucino. The five 
on-campus Starbucks — located at the Reitz Union,  the Levin College of Law, the Hub, Library West and Shands — guarantee students will 
get their caffeine fix.
While the Hub may be conve-
nient, its Starbucks is more slug-
gish than than other locations be-
cause of its placement in the heart 
of the campus — the farther from the concentration of classroom buildings, the quicker the service. 
For those looking for a meal in 
a less hectic setting, the Camellia Café offers a peaceful view of the Harn Museum of Art and soups, salads, sandwiches, tapas and des-
serts guaranteed to please the taste 
buds — albeit at a cost slightly higher than most on-campus food.
The Arredondo Café, located on 
the fourth floor of the Reitz Union, 
reopened during Summer A and 
offers an upscale menu without upscale prices and a panoramic view of campus. 
The Reitz 
Union has the widest selection of food 
and is a 
popu -lar place for students living on campus to eat dinner or grab a 
meal between classes. 
The Reitz also features Taco 
Bell, Starbucks, Pollo Tropical, Subway and Freshëns. In addition, 
students can enjoy Home Zone, 
which features homestyle comfort food, as well as the Noodle Bar and The Orange & Brew, a campus cof-
fee shop. 
On a beautiful fall day when the 
weather has finally dipped below 
90, enjoying Hare Krishna lunch on the Plaza of the Americas is a 
treat.
Krishna lunch, which is served 
every day rain or shine, offers veg-
etarian and vegan Indian-inspired 
dishes and includes dessert and a 
drink, all for $4. It’s arguably the best deal on campus, both in taste and price.
Vegetarian offerings helped UF 
make PETA’s Top 10 Best Vegetar-ian-Friendly Colleges in the U.S. for the past three years.
In addition to vegetarian, ani-
mal-friendly options, UF also fo-cuses on sustainability through its reusable containers. 
“Our reusable to-go container 
program allows us 
to reduce the 
178,000 disposable clamshells used on 
campus each year,” said Susie 
Lewis, the sustainability coordi-nator at Gator Dining Services. “It reduces waste while engaging our customers in a sustainable habit.”
The program, which began in 
the spring, has about 400 active participants, Lewis said.
Students with a meal plan can 
join the program for free and oth-ers can join for a one-time $7 fee. The boxes can be used at campus dining facilities as well as Moe’s and Home Zone. 
The express food centers like 
those featured at Little Hall, Pugh Hall and Beaty Market offer pre-packaged samplings of sandwich-
es, sushi, bottled drinks and more. 
For convenience, these places are foolproof, but in terms of a bar-gain, it’s probably best to avoid these places and stock up at the 
grocery store instead. 
On top of dorms, classes, books 
and that whole independence 
thing, it may seem hard to keep 
track of all the food options on 
campus. But knowing options be-sides a late-night pizza delivery (hint: call Five Star!) can keep you 
satisfied for every meal of 
the day.

� THE DATA COMPARES THE 
PRINCETON REVIEW’S TOP 20 PARTY UNIVERSITIES FOR 2009.
 By STEPHANIE LEVENTHAL 
 Alligator Contributing Writer 
   
 UF may be a top party school, 
but it was ranked sixth in the 
earning potential of graduates, according to a new survey.
PayScale, a company that 
collects employee salary data, decided to ﬁ  nd out if Princeton Review’s 2009 top 20 party uni-
versities prepare students for the 
competitive job market, accord-ing to its Web site.
The University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), No. 
16 party university, was placed 
ﬁ  rst on the list. Loyola University New Orleans, No. 20, was ranked last. 
According to the survey, the 
starting median salary for a UF graduate with a four-year degree is $47,300 and the mid-career median salary is $88,400. This is 
lower than UIUC graduates who 
have a starting median salary of $53,900 and a mid-career median salary of $99,700.
According to Al Lee, director 
of quantitative analysis at Pay-Scale, only paid, full-time em-ployees with bachelor’s degrees were taken into consideration for the survey.
The data set was made up of 
more than 1.2 million users regis-
tered on the PayScale Web site.  
The purpose was to offer a 
sense of earning potential by 
school during the worst econom-
ic climate in the past 80 years, he 
said. 
According to Lee, cost of liv-
ing was not considered because university graduates do not al-
ways stay in the state where they 
studied.
If the results were adjusted for 
living expense in each state, UF 
would rank signiﬁ  cantly higher, 
said Mark Rush, a UF professor of economics. 
UF graduates tend to work in 
Florida, where living is cheaper 
than in places like Santa Barbara, 
Calif., he said. 
Jose Lobo, an industrial and 
systems engineer who just ﬁ  n-ished his master’s degree at UF, said it was senseless to relate the  party-school label to median sal-aries earned. 
Salaries are determined in 
terms of type of job, experi-ence, degrees earned and skills required and not whether the school is a public, private or par-
ty school, he said. 
Jeff Young, a third-year ﬁ  t-
ness and wellness major, said he 
thinks party school graduates are more likely to have outgoing per-
sonalities that beneﬁ  t them in job 
interviews.
“It’s an apples and oranges 
comparison and assumes that 
you put stock in the party-school 
ranking,” UF spokesman Steve Orlando said. 
UF students are exception-
ally smart and the SAT and ACT 
scores of the incoming freshman 
support that, he said.
“If they like to have fun then 
they like to have fun,” he said. 
“You can have the best of both 
worlds.”
The university wants its grad-
uates to make a good living, and a high salary is not the only mea-
sure of success, Orlando said.
“We don’t educate people to 
be money-making machines,” he 
said. “We educate them so they 
can contribute to society.” UF graduates rank sixth in U.S. for potential salaries

While they’re not exactly the 
fantastic fairy tales of the Brothers 
Grimm, UF has its own collection of myths and legends passed on from year to year.
UF law students can blame their 
study woes on ghosts, since the Col-lege of Law is built over the site of an ancient Native American burial ground. Rumor has it that ghosts haunt this area, unable to rest since their burial ground was defiled.
“Well, it is built on an Indian 
burial ground, there is a big sign 
out front that says that,” said Steve 
Orlando, UF spokesman. “I suspect a lot of beleaguered, study-worn law students would say that it is very true.”
Norman Hall, which is home to 
the College of Education, is said to be haunted by the ghost of a little girl who died in the building in 
the 1930s. According to university 
archivist Carl Van Ness, Norman Hall was the original site of P.K. Yonge Developmental Research School, a K-12 school.
The residence building Thomas 
Hall is supposedly haunted by the spirit of Steve, the old cafete-ria cook. Before the hall was con-verted to strictly housing, Thomas Hall had a large cafeteria, which was run by Steve. According to the legend, Steve still walks the halls banging his pots and pans together 
and can be heard throughout the 
building.
Van Ness said that there really 
was an old cook in Thomas Hall named Steve, and when he died, the students wanted to keep his memory alive through this legend.
“He was the cook for many 
years, and after he died, many stu-
dents suggested that the sounds of 
the clanging of the radiator pipes was really Steve,” Van Ness said.
Century Tower is another build-
ing on campus with a few legends surrounding it. One legend is that there was at one point a pit around the tower that held live alligators. According to Van Ness, this legend 
is true. Between 1953 and 1970, UF 
built an alligator pen around Cen-tury Tower to hold their live mas-
cots. This is where the very first 
Albert the Alligator came from.
UF eventually had to stop using 
live alligator mascots because they were being mistreated. The first Albert was found beaten to death, and Florida State University stu-dents kidnapped his replacement, Albert II, as a prank. UF went 
through several alligators, and all 
of them died or developed health problems before the idea of a live mascot was scrapped.
A second legend surrounding 
Century Tower is about its bricks. It is said that any time a virgin gradu-ates from UF, a brick will fall from the top of the tower.  As anyone 
can tell you now, Century Tower 
still stands tall and sturdy.
“It’s still standing and still in-
tact. That’s all I’ll say about that,” said Orlando.
The Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fra-
ternity brothers are doing their part to help keep Century Tower standing tall for years to come. In 
front of the SAE Fraternity house 
is a lion statue, which is constantly being painted different colors.
According to the legend, when-
ever an SAE Fraternity member takes a girl’s virginity, the lion will be repainted the color of her pant-ies.
“Some things are better left to 
other people’s imaginations,” SAE President Andrew Peluso said. “We recently set fire to the lion about a 
year and a half ago. We had years 
and years and years of paint on the lion and had to burn it all off.”
Beaty Towers also have their 
own legend, which 
states that there 
once was a girl who committed suicide by jump-
ing off the roof of one of the tow-
ers. Later, songwriter and musician Tom Petty, a Gainesville native, supposedly wrote his song “Amer-ican Girl” based on this legend.
Orlando said that no one has 
committed suicide by jumping off Beaty Towers. Orlando also said that he has met Petty in person, and 
Petty told him that the song was 
not inspired by this rumor.

Just because you live on campus 
doesn’t mean you’re stuck there.
Just outside the city limits of 
Gainesville are small towns and 
parks that offer tubing, camping, art 
and diverse menu items. 
About 30 minutes north on U.S. 
441, located in the town of High Springs, Ginnie Springs offers a 
getaway that is popular among UF 
students and Alachua County resi-
dents.
For $19.26, visitors can gain ad-
mission, rent a tube and float down the 72-degree water, exploring crys-tal-clear springs and jumping off a 
tree swing.
Kayaking, camping and scuba 
diving are also available and prices 
can be found on the Web site at 
www.ginniespringsoutdoors.com.
Rose Meadows, general manager 
of Ginnie Springs Outdoors, said that college students are drawn to 
the springs because of the wealth of activities and laid back atmosphere.
“The best part of Ginnie Springs 
is being able to have freedom,” Meadows said. “You can just spend your day out here doing your thing, 
like canoeing, kayaking, scuba div-ing, hiking trails, camping or vol-leyball.”
A long day on the river can bring 
on an insatiable hunger and thirst. The Great Outdoors Restaurant and Spring House Tavern is convenient-
ly located on Main Street in High 
Springs about 10 minutes away 
from Ginnie Springs.
Voted Best New Restaurant by Florida Monthly Magazine, The Great Outdoors is more than just food. On Friday and Saturday 
nights, live music sets the mood for alfresco dining on a Christmas light 
lined patio.
Before transforming into a res-
taurant, the building was construct-
ed in 1895 as an opera house and still holds the romantic atmosphere that 
was created over a century ago.
Another nature escape located 
south of Gainesville on SW 13th 
Street is Paynes Prairie Preserve 
State Park. Visitors can follow 
the prehistoric footsteps of giant 
ground-sloths, mastodons, mam-
moths and saber-toothed tigers. These days, however,  visitors are 
more likely to run into bison, alliga-tors and wild horses. 
The park, which is open daily 
from 8 a.m. until sundown, boasts more then 270 species of birds and 
holds about 21,000 acres of natural  
land.
If it is a classic Florida adven-
ture that one craves, Marjorie Kin-
nan Rawlings Historic State Park in Cross Creek offers a look inside the 
1930s home and life of the Pulitzer 
Prize-winning novelist. 
“It mixes the outside and the 
arts,” Gainesville resident Cody Hunter said. “You can tour her 
house and grounds and learn about her literary impact.”
Located 30 miles Southeast of 
Gainesville down a winding road, travelers can take in the native North 
Florida landscape and area wildlife. 
The park offers a tour of the  house, farmyard, grove and a hike around 
the property. It is open daily from 9 
a.m. to 5 p.m.
Rawlings’ novel’s namesake, The 
Yearling Restaurant, is just down the road and serves up Southern cuisine 
at its finest, including venison, quail, 
turtle and frog legs. Adding to the 
flavor and atmosphere, local celebri-
ty and bluesman Willie Green plays 
his harmonica and guitar.MONDAY, AUGUST 17, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 17

Students can still party like they’re at the 
No. 1 — or No. 2 — party school in the na-
tion — as long as they do it legally.
The Underage Prohibition in Alcohol 
Beverage Establishments Act, which went 
into effect April 1, prohibits bars and clubs 
that receive a specific number of underage drinking violations from admitting people under the age of 21 after 9 p.m. 
But according to data from the first three 
months, no bar has exceeded the limit, said Commissioner Jeanna Mastrodicasa, who promoted the act in its planning stages. 
“We’ve been seeing a lot more enforce-
ment at the door,” she said. 
In the spring, the Gainesville Police De-
partment trained bar owners and bouncers how to be stricter, she said.
Some bars ask for two forms of identifi-cation, use scanners to validate IDs or use 
black lights to confirm that IDs are not fake. 
The methods of verification are up to each bar owner.
But though early data shows bars have 
been doing a good job, the true test will come this fall, according to Mastrodicasa.
“Fall semester is always hard,” she said. 
“It’s football season, let’s start there.”
Matt Goldberger, former external affairs 
director for Student Government, spoke out against the act last spring, predicting that it would lead to more house parties with un-regulated drinking. 
He said the bar atmosphere creates a saf-
er environment than house parties because it’s ultimately harder for underage people to drink at bars and that all of the bars are on the Later Gator bus route. 
Goldberger said it’s good the act is work-
ing but is worth reviewing after fall.  
Mastrodicasa doesn’t predict any more house parties than usual, she said, which 
could’ve been the case had the city chosen 
to make all bars only 21 and up, an option avoided in the best interest “of students and the city of Gainesville.”
 She said she’s aware that people are still 
going to party in Gainesville, but she said what it comes down to is making an effort. 
“I know there are people whose IDs look 
just like another person, and you’ll hear 
from friends where it’s easier to drink and 
where it’s not,” she said.
GPD spokesman Keith Kameg said 
it’s important to remember that drink-ing laws haven’t changed, just the way they are enforced. 
“If you’re getting into UF, you’re 
one of the smartest people and you know the drinking laws,” he said.  
Establishments with occupan-
cies under 201 are penalized after more than five underage drinking violations in a 90-day period. Bars 
with occupancies of more than 201 will be 
penalized after more than 10 violations.   
Officers won’t patrol bars any more than 
they have in the past, according to Kameg.
“Picking out underage drinkers in 
Gainesville isn’t the hardest thing to do,” K a m e g said.

Alyssa Watson had difficulty 
finding a job in Gainesville this 
summer, and she was not alone.
The 21-year-old marketing 
senior at UF said she definitely 
noticed the lack of employ-
ment available, even though the number of students living in Gainesville for the summer is much lower than during the fall 
and spring semesters.
Due in large part to the econ-
omy, many UF undergraduate 
students are struggling to find 
employment.
Watson said she thinks that 
the lack of jobs is creating diffi-
culties for students who need to pay for classes or rent during the 
fall term. 
“If I’m having this hard of a 
time finding a job already, I’m re-
ally worried about what’s going 
to happen to me when I graduate college,” Watson said.
This fall, as more than 6,000 
baby Gators begin their college 
careers at UF, the hunt for jobs will become even more competi-tive.
Nadene Francis, assistant 
director of public relations for UF’s Career Resource Center, said she has noticed the increas-ing amount of students who are 
seeking employment advice from 
her office.
Francis said the center has 
come up with new and innova-tive ways to accommodate the 
students seeking assistance, in-
cluding an updated Web site with tips on searching for a part-time job.
“The potential for interesting 
and rewarding part-time work is there,” she said. “It just takes time to find it.”
But as Watson enters her se-
nior year of college at UF this fall, she finds herself still unem-ployed.
“I’ve applied at every res-
taurant and business I can think of,” she said. “Waiting for the employers to call me back is the worst part.”
As of June, the city of Gaines-
ville’s unemployment rate was 10.3 percent.
This is slightly lower than 
Florida’s rate of 10.6 percent and just over the national rate of 9.4 percent for the same month, ac-cording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Web site.
On Aug. 26, the UF Career Re-source Center and Student Finan-cial Affairs will hold a Part-Time 
Job Fair.
The fair will last from 10 a.m. 
to 2 p.m. on the J. Wayne Reitz 
Student Union North Lawn. The event will be free for UF students 
and alumni.
University departments and 
local employers will attend and  
recruit students for part-time and 
seasonal hiring needs.
Students are encouraged to 
bring their resumes and fall class 
schedules. 
Francis said the number of 
on-campus jobs is expected to de-cline this fall, due to departments hiring fewer student workers or even none at all.
She said that at last year’s job 
fair, more than 1,000 students were in attendance. This year, she expects even more students to attend.
“As long as the weather holds 
up, we are expecting a good turn-out,” she said.
“Financial aid has been lim-
ited, so students are looking for ways to not run dry.”
Students who are fortunate 
enough to have found a job in Gainesville say they are not tak-
ing it for granted.
Anita Miller, a sophomore 
accounting major, said she feels 
lucky to work as a desk assistant 
for the Center for Student Activi-
ties and Involvement at UF.
“I’m not planning on leaving 
this job anytime soon,” Miller said.
“If I tried to look for another 
job now, I probably wouldn’t be able to find one.”
Miller said that despite the ir-
ritation some students may feel during their job searches, she thinks having a positive attitude is still the best way to impress fu-ture employers.
“A smile goes a long way,” 
she said.

Freshman FAQ

What’s there to do in Alachua County?
  Located about 45 minutes outside of Gainesville, 
the springs are a natural resource with water coming 
from the underground aquifer. The water stays 72 degrees all year long, offering a refreshing day trip. Overnight camping is also available at most tubing 
locations. 
  In Fort White, students can ﬁ  nd a cheaper alterna-
tive to the above mentioned springs by tubing down 
the Ichetucknee River. However, plastic bottles, cans, glass and alcohol are not allowed. 
Paynes Prairie  State Preserve Park offers cycling, 
walking, equestrian trails, camping, picnicking, wild-life viewing and boat ramp access to Lake Wauburg. 
  The Devil’s Millhopper is a geological state park 
featuring a 120-feet deep, bowl-shaped cavity lead-ing down to a miniature rain forest. The park is open from Wednesday through Sunday and has been vis-ited since the 1880s.  
UF’s Lake Wauburg  offers students, faculty and 
staff activities such as boating, swimming, volleyball, a team development course and a climbing wall. All you need for admission is a Gator 1 Card, which can admit up to four. Where can I study?
 All nine libraries on campus offer 
quiet sections for studying and many 
house study rooms. The UF teaching center, in Broward Hall, offers free tu-toring in math, reading and writing. 
Note services such as Smokin’ Notes or 
Einstein Notes offer exam study materi-als, and Tutoring Zone holds review ses-sions for many class exams.  
How can I study abroad? 
  Students can chose from more than 
800  programs that range from one week 
to an entire year. According to Interna-tional Center Study Abroad Director Su-sanne Hill, students who are interested 
in study abroad need to attend an infor-
mation session offered at the Interna-tional Center located in the HUB. 
From the information session, stu-
dents will meet with advisers to deter-mine which country is best for them.  What about drop/add ?  
 For about a week at the beginning 
of the the semester, students can adjust 
their schedules by adding and drop-ping classes. If you need a class you couldn’t get earlier, then the drop/
add period is the time to try again. 
Students are able to drop classes 
throughout the semester until a cut-
off date, which is few weeks before ﬁ  nals. Students have only two drops per 60 credits.  Where should I buy books? 
 Here’s a bookstore breakdown: 
Aside from the UF Bookstore, 
the area around the campus is full of other options for new and used text-books, most of which are in walking 
distance from the campus. Be sure 
to check out The Florida Bookstore, Gator Textbooks and Orange and Blue Textbooks. 
How does the football
ticket lottery work? 
 If you want to get season football 
tickets you have to register for the 
student season football ticket lottery and pre-pay for your tickets. In April students get an e-mail announcing 
when the lottery opens. Students can  
pay $70 for season tickets, and in June they receive an e-mail notifying them of the decision. Those who didn’t get tickets will receive a refund.   How does the bus system 
work on campus? 
 Campus bus services are free, and 
most routes run from about 6 a.m. to 7 
p.m. City routes are free for students with a Gator 1 Card. Check out the bus stops by your apartment or dorm 
to see what number bus will take you 
to campus. Visit www.go-rts.com for a complete bus schedule. What Baby Gators need to know to make the most of their first yearBy IVAN VARGAS

No matter your vice, it’s not hard to find 
your fix in Gainesville. From beer to boobs, 
the city is home to plenty of stores that will entertain your wild side.
Getting it on for more than 20 years, 
French Addiction is an adult toy store and lingerie shop that sells costumes, movies and sex toys for both men and women.
Although some might have reservations 
about entering the pink building at 819 W. University Ave., employee Nichole Crosby said there’s no need to be shy.
“We make it a point to make the atmo-
sphere comfortable,”Crosby said. “I mean 
screw it, everyone deserves to feel good.” 
Along with apparel and other goodies, 
French Addiction also offers talent schedul-
ing for bachelorette parties and pole-dancing lessons that take place in the store. It’s $25 for an introductory class and $15 for each ad-ditional class, Crosby said.
“It’s great exercise,” she said.Not too far from the naughty adult para-
dise is a place where people can buy some-thing for  their bodies that is a little more permanent.
Anthem Tattoo Parlor has been in busi-
ness for three years and is owned and op-erated by longtime friends Rob Barnes, 35, Dave Kotinsley, 33, and Mike Mehaffey, 32.
The owners, forearms coated with art, 
said they make a conscious effort to keep the mood laid back and friendly.
Although the artists tattoo in all shapes, 
sizes and colors, clients won’t see “flash-racks” in the parlor.
Flash-racks, Mehaffey explained, are stock 
collections of art that are created beforehand and ready to go — the tattoo equivalent to fast food.“We draw up everything for every client,” 
Mehaffey said, adding that the store primar-ily caters to serious collectors.
The partners have all had lifelong love af-
fairs with the art of tattooing.
On the store Web site, anthemtattoo.com, 
Barnes recalls his grandfather’s tattoo from World War II and Kotinsley reminisces about learning to tattoo using sewing needles.
While there are four full-time artists, a fifth spot is left vacant for traveling guest art-
ists to fill.
For those who prefer art on the wall, Mod-
ern Age Tobacco and Gift Shop at 1122 W. 
University Ave. might be more appealing.
Lining the inside of the shop are vintage  
Alberto Vargas pinups. The store also boasts about 500 varieties of fine cigars along with rows of blown-glass pipes and ornamented hookahs.Patrick Patton, 27, heads the shop, which 
began as a family business founded by his father.
“This place is one of a kind,” Patton said. 
“What other smoke shop can you buy an original Vargas pinup at?” 
For Modern Age employees, smoking is 
more than just a business or hobby.
“It’s like a tradition,” said 25-year-old 
employee Jonathan Watkins “It’s nice to sit 
down with friends and family and have a 
smoke.”
Although they say they are extremely 
passionate about smoking, Patton and his coworkers will tell you that is not the only thing they offer.
In a separate room at the back of the shop, 
those interested can browse adult film titles as well.
“You don’t have to be a smoker to come 
in here,” Patton said “We get students, doc-tors, lawyers. We get everybody.”
If smoking isn’t your vice of choice, a dif-
ferent one is just a few steps away. 
Located directly next door at 1126 W. 
University Ave., Gator Beverage has one of the largest selections of beer in town.
About 300 varieties, ranging from craft-
brewed imports to obscure domestics, are available. 
The store is family owned and operated, 
something that employee Mike Collins, 33, said he appreciates.
“You’re not just some asshole working 
for some asshole,” he said. “They’re cool people.”
Although the store’s diverse beer selec-
tion is impressive, there are plenty more bev-erages to choose from. 
In addition to the beer-intensive inven-
tory, Gator Beverage boasts several floor-to-ceiling wine racks and a wall of hard liquor behind the front counter.22, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 17, 2009

Whether it’s at night, on the weekend, 
between classes or just a lazy afternoon, 
Gainesville has plenty to offer without having to  stray into the ordinary. From scaling walls to blazing trails, here are a few ways to break a 
sweat without having to hit the treadmill.
Mountain biking
Discover the beauty of your hometown as 
you shoot down trails you may have never seen 
before. With more than 20 cyclists on most rides, it’s a great way to get to know fellow rid-ers and work those thighs. Make sure you bring your helmet, a water bottle and a can-do attid-
tude.  Groups ride out from Mr. Goodbike, 421 
NW 13th St., Wednesdays at 6:30 p.m.
 
Rock Climbing  
For a fierce mental and physical workout, 
scale the walls of the Gainesville Rock Gym, 704 S Main St.
 The gym offers more than 85,000 square 
feet of wall to challenge you. With various lev-els of difficulty, you’re sure to find your niche. Not claustraphobic? Try climbing the cave and tunnel system. You’ll feel like you’re miles away from flat-terrained Florida. 
“It’s an awesome upper body workout,” said 
Rock Gym employee Christopher Harabaglia.
Roller Derby
Gainesville Roller Rebels, a women’s roller 
derby league, is far from your typical day at the skating rink. With bumps and spills all along the track, it’s amusing for both skaters and spectators. If you can handle rough play, this sport will give you a great leg workout and help you let out your aggressions. 
“It’s not soccer, it’s not softball, it’s differ-
ent. There’s a huge sisterhood aspect,” said league founder Catherine “Ms. Rebel” See-mann. The Gainesville Roller Rebels will hold its next recruiting event Oct. 21 from 8 to 10 p.m., at Skate Station Funworks, 1311 NW 76th Blvd. 
Bike Polo
Bike polo is like soccer, but on bikes. Fine 
tune your balance and stamina skills while gaining friends and maybe a few grass stains. Find out about future matches at Bikepolo.blogspot.com
 “It’s just a good sport you can get together 
with your friends and do,” said bike polo player Duncan Neiderlitz. 
Japanese sword lessons
Iaido, the art of apanese sword lessons and 
traditional exercises, provides insight into his-toric Japanese culture and the samurai code. Although not as physically demanding as more 
high-intensity forms of martial arts, you should 
still be prepared for a good strength-training session. Classes are held in Gainesville at the Unified Training Center, 809 W University Ave., Mondays and Wednesdays at 6:15 p.m, and cost $10 a session. 
Capture the flag
Channel your inner child by revisiting this 
playground favorite. In Gainesville, a group meets Tuesdays at midnight to play. Follow the group on Facebook — search for “Gainesville Capture the Flag.” The events offer an oppo-runity for meeting new friends and  good, clean horsing around fun. All the running is sure to 
provide a good cardio workout. 
Pole dancing
Pole dancing lessons are a great way for 
women to explore their sexual side. It’s a de-
cent workout, and your boyfriend will defi-nitely be interested to see what you learned in class. Classes are held most days of the week at 
French Addiction, 819 W University Ave. The 
classes cost $60 for a four-week package. 
“It creates a self discovery that women re-
ally enjoy,” said French Addiction owner Mary Jane Brunel.MONDAY, AUGUST 17, 2009   � ALLIGATOR, 25
34th Street mural serves as local landmark, memorial
SISTINE GURREY
avenue writer
One day, the wall reads, “Two geese 
cannot achieve happiness alone.” It 
wishes Manda Kate a happy 16th birth-
day. It thanks a wife for her hard work.
The next day, it might resurrect Bob 
Marley, welcome back a friend or say 
nothing at all.
In a place where time is represented 
by the thickness of the paint on the wall, the 34th Street mural freezes in time a moment in students’ lives.
For years, the wall has been a place 
for self-expression by UF, and Santa Fe College students, and Gainesville resi-dents; however, if you’re new in town, you might not yet know about this 
timeless post.
“A lot of freshmen don’t know 
about a lot of things,” said John Parady, 
a freshman studying finance and po-litical science. “I think the wall is one 
of those hidden traditions at UF that 
people come to know with time.”
The wall is not just a tradition. It is 
a memorial to the living and the dead with each layer of latex paint. But, time stands still at the middle.
Almost two decades after the mur-
der of five students at UF and SFCC, the mural that served as a shrine to the victims on 34th Street still remains. However, the meaning behind the lay-
ers of paint is fading as a younger gen-
eration moves in town.
“It’s a college town,” said Erich 
Usery, a Gainesville native and UF stu-dent. “The population is always chang-
ing and growing. The wall has faded 
from importance and from people’s minds.”
Usery can remember the memorial 
ever since he moved in to the apart-ments across the street from the wall at the age of three. However, he always found it difficult to identify with it.
“I see it, and I respect it for what it 
is,” he said. “That is as far as it goes for me. I wasn’t born when it happened.”
The wall was built in 1979 when 
the Florida Department of Transpor-
tation expanded the street from two 
lanes to four. However, the department didn’t realize it created an icon for the city, where locals, students and artists would express themselves with colors and words on any of the 45 panels, each 
about 20 feet long.
The panel at the crest of the arching 
wall takes you back in time. It has not 
changed in almost 19 years.
On Sept. 3, 1990, two men with 
a plan and $11.25 used their grocery money to buy paintbrushes, rollers and 
the cheapest paint they could find.
They forced 
their Honda Spree up a hill on 34th Street until they 
reached the crest of 
a 1,120-foot-long wall that borders the 
Mark Bostick Golf Course. That night, they painted a message on the concrete wall dedicated to the memory of the 
five students who were murdered by 
Danny Rolling in August 1990. It read, “We Remember” in bold, white letters on a black background, followed by the 
names of the victims: Sonja Larson, 
Christina Powell, Christa Leigh Hoyt, Tracy Paules and Manuel Taboada.The following day, Paul Chase and Adam Tritt’s discount mural became a shrine to the students.
“We figured we’d give the city a 
central memorial,” said Tritt, who owns a medical practice in Palm Bay.
Weeks and months passed. Birth-
day wishes, marriage proposals, political comments and art were painted on the wall and then quickly covered by some-thing else, but the memorial stayed, occasionally being touched up by “the 
keepers of the wall,” unknown artists 
who kept the wall intact.
 “It wasn’t supposed to last this 
long,” Tritt said. “It wasn’t even sup-
posed to last a week.”
For the next 10 years, Sadie Dar-
nell, then public information officer for 
the Gainesville Police Department and now Alachua County Sheriff, would 
touch up the wall whenever someone 
painted over it, but sometimes it would be done by the time she got there, ac-cording to published records.
 Today, the “keepers of the wall” are 
less mysterious.
The Interfraternity Council at UF took on the responsibility to maintain the wall after Darnell announced she wouldn’t maintain the wall anymore.
“We want to keep the memory of 
these students alive,” said Zach Apple-man, the service director for the Inter-fraternity Council. 
Appleman and service volunteers 
from the fraternities and sororities touch up the wall whenever someone reports it has been vandalized. They re-paint the memorial twice a year.
People tend to know by now not to 
paint over the red framed part of the wall. But, it still happens from time to time.
“It frustrates me to see people paint 
over it,” Usery said. “I understand why they would. They don’t really know about it.”
The Interfraternity Council plans to 
put a plaque on the wall with the names of the victims this fall. Maybe then, people won’t forget.
“We are not going to set up this me-
morial for it to be forgotten,” he said. “We want to make it more significant to the Gainesville community.”
Don’t ruin college for yourself, silence your cell phone

When I was in high school, I was convinced I 
had the nosiest, most intrusive parents.
“For the last time, I’m not going to any college!” 
I used to shout at them. “My 600-pound lover and I 
are eloping in Vegas after I graduate.”
I was so blind. Upon arriving at college, I was 
shocked to discover that many students’ parents call or text-message them more than five times daily. 
I was always under the impression parents 
bought their teenagers cell phones as a ceremonial gesture, marking the passage into adulthood. Their generation received the keys to old, dying Volkswa-gens; ours receives iPhones and rollover minutes. 
Little did I know that some parents use cell 
phones like leashes, extending their jurisdiction from cul-de-sac to campus. 
“Hold on, my mom’s calling,” my friend will say, 
digging through her purse. My epic tale of a juicy Facebook chat conversation from the night before is put on hold until Ft. Lauderdale’s most outspoken PTA treasurer is convinced her angel is safe. 
“Sorry, I was in the bathroom when you called 
earlier,” she’d say. “No, I’m not bulimic.” 
I once proposed that her mother leave a voice-
mail. “If I don’t pick up, 
she’ll think I’m dead,” my friend told me. “My 
mom has called the cops 
before.”
The cops! My parents 
wouldn’t even call the au-thorities if they watched a video of me tied up in cave in Afghanistan, masked insurgents prodding me with AK-47s. 
“That’s too bad,” my mother would sigh. “Let’s 
cash in his savings bonds and buy crack!”Too many students are harassed by needy, sus-
picious parents. I once found a guy slumped in a parked car outside a party, cupping his cell phone 
to his mouth, soberly assuring his mother that he 
was actually studying in his dorm. 
I pity my teet-whipped friends. They enjoy as 
much privacy as endangered pandas, or registered sex offenders. They can’t skip a class, buy a movie ticket, or commit a thought-crime without the folks knowing about it. Let’s put an end to this.
Your cell phone is not a baby monitor. Let the 
call go to voicemail, and start the moment they call 
after dropping you off at your dorm. 
If your parents don’t grow up, you won’t either.

There must be something in the 
water. 
The town that inspired the begin-
nings of Tom Petty and the Heart-
breakers, Less Than Jake and Bernie Leadon of The Eagles continues to produce bands of every genre, mak-ing Gainesville a hotbed for musical talent.
Here are a few bands that have 
made a name for themselves and are worth checking out while they are still in town. 
The Shoddy Beatles
Genre: Beatles cover band
This band has a knack for accuracy 
when it comes to playing some of the greatest songs of the century. They play every Beatles song exactly note-for-note as the Fab Four did back in the day. Vocally, they sound the same too. If you were to close your eyes at their concert, you’d think you were really at a Beatles concert. They are definitely a group worth seeing, even though they don’t play that often.
Morningbell
Genre: Indie Psychedelic RockIf you want to see a good indie 
band, Morningbell is it. They’ve al-ready come out with three albums, and a fourth one is set for release Sept. 4. They’ve been recognized by MTV, The Washington Post and Blender Magazine. The Onion describes them perfectly: “The Pink Floyd-ish harmonic dreaminess, Carribean-styled spacey experimentation, and swiftly moving country-tinged foot-tappers make for a record that’s fine 
as an eclectic indie-rock mishmash.”  
The Duppies
Genre: Ska and Reggae
Catch these guys before they go 
on tour. The seven-piece ensemble of 
bass, saxophone, drums, trumpet and 
guitar sums up part of Gainesville’s 
culture. These guys consider them-selves to be Gainesville’s finest ska, 
rocksteady, reggae machine, according 
to their MySpace page. Their instru-
ments and smooth vocals can be heard 
Aug 29 at Common Grounds.
Dear Dakota
Genre: Rock
If you like Anberlin, Saoasin and 
Fall Out Boy, you’ll like Dear Dakota. They are on the verge of making it big. 
They’ve got gigs all around the state 
and have opened shows for national 
bands like Motion City Soundtrack, Mayday Parade, My American Heart and Mae. Just imagine what their 
shows are like when they come back to 
their hometown, Gainesville.
There is a ton of other bands to see 
while in Gainesville, so keep an eye 
out for concerts at local venues.Local bands impress at shows, makes waves nationally26, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 17, 2009

Live it up, stay on budget

College has a way of dwindling your bank 
account faster than you can chug a lukewarm 
can of Natty Light.  
After tuition, books, rent and bar tabs 
deduct themselves from your free student checking account, it is only a matter of time before you’re contemplating selling your plas-
ma and living off Easy Mac. 
Before you do,  take a look at some of the 
tricks that allow even the stingiest of college 
students to eat great, dress trendy and have fun without breaking the bank. 
   There is no frugal living without first own-
ing the cheapskate’s bible — the Gator Green-back. The one time you should not steer clear of people handing out fliers in Turlington is 
when these are distributed. Gator Green-
backs are free books full of coupons for places all over Gainesville ranging from car repair shops to ice cream stores. They really come in handy. 
If your parents pay your phone bill, try 
signing up for Mobile Campus. You’ll get text message updates regarding cheap rent, free food and discounted clothing.  
For other food deals, try Mother’s Pub on 
University. As long as you are over 18, you can enjoy 35 cent chicken wings on Mon-days after 7 p.m. and $2 burgers with fries on Wednesday from 3 to 9 p.m.
 If you like Chinese food, China Star of-
fers an entire dish (including pork fried rice and a can of soda) for $5.45.
If you haven’t met Craig and his list of 
free classified ads yet, now is the time for in-troductions. Craigslist.org has linked people with roommates, jobs and even tickets to Gator games, but the most valuable use for students could be getting books through the 
site. Amazon.com and Facebook Market-place are also smart ways to find cheaper books than you would at the bookstore. 
As a college student, you will learn that 
being trendy doesn’t have anything to do 
with being pricey. At places like Plato’s Closet, Fashion Exchange, Flashback’s and 
Sandy’s Savvy Chic Resale Boutique you can 
find great name- brand clothing for a quarter of the price you would normally pay. Think French Connection dresses for $15 dollars 
and Quicksilver tees for $5. These stores will 
also pay you for your gently used clothing and accessories, so your old clothes can pay for new ones.  
Now that you’ve figured out how to buy 
the basics, let’s have a little fun. The Florida 
Museum of Natural His-tory offers a “Museum Nights” special for stu-
dents on select Thursday 
nights, allowing you free admission to participate in demonstrations and 
hands-on activities at the museum. 
If you’re more of a homebody, Blockbust-
er offers a great deal called “Wacky Wednes-days” at all its Gainesville locations. Rent any three movies, including new releases and Blu-ray, for $5.55 on Wednesdays only. This 
is definitely a deal for stay-at-home savers. 
For social butterflies, fraternity barbeques 
and concerts at Flavet Field are money-saving gems. They are fun, great for meeting 
people, and best of all, free. 
If you find yourself bored, hungry and 
considering dipping into your rent money to 
go out on Saturday night, try cutting corners 
instead. 
After all, the best things in life are (al-
most) free.

Dear Alisha,
This summer has been incredibly busy. 
Aside from packing for college, working over-time at my job, and volunteering at a sum-mer camp I am in desperate need for a break before my freshman year! What would you suggest as a way to relax and take time for 
myself?     
   Signed,  
    Miss  
Overachiever.
Dear Miss Overachiever,These days, it is hard to not look like a 
walking, baggy-eyed zombie. But sometimes you just do not want to stop going!.Therefore, I have mapped out some ideas on how to de-tox yourself from stress. Prepare to sell those textbooks and take a breath. 
Treat your body. Sometimes exercise can 
be the biggest stress reliever. Choosing to take a cardio class instead of usual working out will help you focus on the routine and less on your personal thoughts. Following the beats of the music will give you peace of mind and a healthy body. 
Feeling more adventurous? If money is not 
an issue then travel out of town. Airfare, ho-tels and tourist attractions are desperate for money, which means costs have been suffi-ciently lowered.
Remember, these activities do not have to 
be done alone. Sometimes, the best source of fun can be found with friends and family
Overachiever, let’s save the endless source 
of energy for the energizer bunny and get the hours of relaxation you deserve. Dear Alisha,
This year, I’m a freshman and have a pas-
sion to study art as my major. However, my parents want me to stick with a science and 
focus on a pre-med track. I want to enjoy 
whatever career I choose and I know that medicine is not for me. But, my parents are paying for my full out-of-state tuition and would feel extremely hurt if I told them I didn’t want to study medicine. Help!
  Signed,
  What2Do
Dear What2Do,Although you may have a passion for art, 
you have four years to make up your mind. At least for the next two years stay open-minded to all career options.  Telling your parents you 
will not study science whatso-ever is irrational to say if you have never taken a college-
level science class before. 
However, if your parents are not open-mind-
ed then this can be a problem too.
Approach your parents with the attitude 
that you respect their opinions, but that you feel you should keep your options open to ex-plore all studies before picking a specific field. At some point, both you and your parents will have to become open minded on your college experience.  
Remember, in the end, you will be the one 
who has to live with the career you choose. You never know if you will take an obscure class that will lead you in a different direc-tion, including science. Enjoy your freshman year and explore all different fields before you officially make up your mind.Cope with first-year stresslocal music 

Practice sensibility when engaging in collegiate romps
 BRANDT WILLIAMS

Freshman year. You are en route to the 
fourth ﬂ  oor of your dorm and notice an at-
tractive neighbor.  Any homesickness unex-
pectedly fades.  You realize that your room-
mate has been MIA for the past few hours and your twin-sized bed is in dire need of christening.  
But hold on —  don’t be so easy.  Of all the courses you will take in college, 
this is about to be the most honest.  Wel-come to your freshman crash-course on col-lege sex.
I have a lot to impart and since word count 
is restricted, let’s dive in with the ﬁ  rst rule you need to know:  College is every bit the exceedingly debauched sex romp you expect, 
so enjoy it.  
It’s in your best interest to stay single, at 
least during freshman year.  And that long-
distance relationship you’re in?  It has the shelf life of a condom left out in the August 
heat.
Now guys, it’s a fact that girls will be able to pull more ass than you.  
Don’t blame the messenger; blame the 
frat parties or girls-drink-free Wednesday nights at Xs.  However, pulling ass will be 
made easier if you invest in your personal appearance.  
And this includes trimming the hair down 
there — after all, Busch Gardens is in Tampa.  
Let’s keep it that way.
Another complaint I’ve often heard from 
women is that men don’t know how to use 
their hands or mouth.  
This is college, if you need to, take a (sex) 
course to learn the ﬁ  ner aspects of female anatomy.
And since this is college, remember you 
are privileged to a staggering lack of privacy 
and your roommate won’t appreciate any ear 
piercing mating calls. 
 Luckily, there are plenty of other loca-
tions to play out mischievous antics — don’t 
overlook the 50-yard line at the stadium or 
dorm showers.
Ladies, one place where you should avoid 
getting intimate is a fraternity house. 
Fraternities are synonymous with “walk of shame,” and men are surprisingly capable of gossip.  
So are nightlife pro-
moters — sure they’re able to slip you into clubs with your fake ID, but that’s not the 
only thing they want to 
slip in.  
Worse are upper-
classmen who deceiv-
ingly whisper, “Wow, you’re so mature, I can’t believe you’re only 18…”
In truth, Carrie Bradshaw knew best when 
she began having sex like a man.  
Unfortunately, many freshman girls don’t 
understand this concept or realize the ma-jority of college men aren’t looking for a re-lationship.  Though you may sense the hint of an emotional connection, men tend to 
view that as a footnote to sex — so don’t be 
surprised if they’re not calling back after you give it up.
Also, watch your drink, especially during 
undisciplined nights of tequila-infused body shots.  
In four years, I’ve had more than eight 
friends who had something slipped in their 
drinks and it didn’t always end well (this in-
cludes you too, guys).
And should you pick up a cute colleague 
at the bar? 
Congratulations, use a condom.  
As I understand it — while not every razor 
burn bump is an STD and a delayed period 
doesn’t necessarily mean you’re the next Oc-tomom — gonorrhea is still a college experi-
ence you don’t want, and HIV is not solely “a 
gay disease.”
STD concerns aside, sex is a healthy and 
integral part of your personal identity. And there is no better time to explore that iden-
tity than these four years. 
Whether you’re singling and mingling, co-
zying up to the idea of a monogamous rela-
tionship, letting your unabashed bi-curiosity 
come out, or grade inﬂ  ating by seducing an 
attractive professor (which is harder than you would think), the university is your oyster and you’ve got more than enough things to see and people to do.

Eat healthy, cheap on the go
MIKE CIADELLA
avenue contributing writer
 
College and fast food usually go 
hand-in-hand, and UF’s campus is no different than most other colleges. But outside the campus boundaries, Gainesville offers numerous options for eating out that are healthy, delicious and affordable.  
 Breakfast isn’t always the easiest 
meal to eat healthy. But if you shoot over to Harvest Thyme at 2 W Univer-sity Ave., you will be immediately taken over by the smell of fresh bread cooking in the morning. Have a cup of their or-ganic coffee, choose from their vegetar-ian menu, or get a fresh smoothie for the road.  
Now for lunch you could just go get 
some greasy, reheated calorie monster from a fast-food place, or you could switch it up and grab an organic, veg-etarian lunch from Book Lover’s Cafe at 505 NW 13th St. The cafe offers a great place to get away from campus and read (or trade) a book, while you munch on a tempeh reuben or the Moroccan po-
tato salad. They also have themed days, 
like Gluten-free Tuesdays or Ethiopian 
Thursdays.  
When that late afternoon double-
block is approaching, it’s very tempting 
to grab a candy bar or a sugar-laden en-
ergy drink. Or you could head over the 
Genesis Juice Bar, 
Bites and Blends at 1109 W University 
Ave., just a short 
walk from campus. 
Try one of their raw juices or super 
smoothies, sure to refresh and energize 
your body and brain. The restaurant 
also offers wraps, salads and soups. 
By dinnertime, you’re worn out, 
hungry and tired of pizza and boring 
subs. How about you walk across from campus and stop into Designer Greens 
at 1702 W University Ave. ]Food is best 
when it’s customized for you, and De-
signer Greens allows you to make your own salad, with 30 different toppings and 14 various dressings. You can also 
throw on a sandwich or wrap to your 
delicious salad if you’re feeling really 
hungry.  
After a late night of studying when 
you’re in the mood for dessert, instead 
of a getting a tub of processed ice cream, 
dip into Karma Cream at 1025 W Uni-
versity Ave., where you can grab some vegan ice cream. 
Everything at Karma Cream is 100 
percent natural, organic and free trade. 
It only offers desserts and coffee, but 
you can also grab an organic beer. Best of all, it’s open until 2 a.m. Friday and Saturday nights.
All of these alternative locales are 
locally owned, not huge corporations, and this comes through in the quality of its food and service. 
None of these places are too expen-
sive, and once you try organic, fresh 
made food, you can completely forget 
about fast food, and the freshman 15 
will forget about you. 
recipes
Easy, homemade chicken tacos 
MAXIM PETTERSEN
avenue contributing writer
Welcome to college! You will probably be here for at least 
the next four years, on your own, without anyone to cook 
for you. Eating out can be expensive, and the meal plans will eventually become unexciting and monotonous. There is al-ways the option to cook your own delicious food. This quick and easy to make recipe costs only about $10 for four to five servings and will hit the spot! 
Chipotle chicken tacos with citrus sour cream
Ingredients: (Serves four to five people and all ingredients 
can be found at the supermarket)
1 pack of corn tortillas 1 can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce1 package of shredded Monterey jack cheese1 head of romaine lettuce, shredded1/2 onion, julienned (cut into strips)1 tomato, diced 1 package of chicken tenders or breasts (cut into strips)1 cup sour cream1 lime, juiced— This recipe consists of three parts; the tortilla, the filling 
and an awesome sauce to top your tacos off. 
— Begin by sautéing the chicken strips, 2 tbsp chopped 
chipotle peppers, 1/2 julienned onion in a skillet on medium-high heat. 
— Prepare the citrus sour cream: Take 1 cup of sour cream 
and add the lime juice. Mix well. This will balance out the 
heat from the chipotle sauce on the chicken. 
— Warm or toast the corn tortillas in the oven, toaster 
oven, or in a dry sauté pan until they are slightly brown. 
— Once all the fillings are ready, start adding them to the 
corn tortilla in this order to allow for the best blending of 
textures and flavors: shredded Monterey jack cheese, sautéed chipotle chicken and onions, shredded lettuce, diced toma-toes, and top it all off with the citrus sour cream. 
— The spicy chipotle chicken and onions will be balanced 
out by the fresh cool tomatoes and zesty citrus sour cream, shredded cheese, and crisp lettuce. These mouthwatering ta-
cos are fun to make and packed with delicious flavor. Enjoy!  Andrew Stanfill/Alligator StaffKyle Fick,

Learn the ropes to campus style
REBEKAH GEIER
avenue writer
It is not often that college and  
fashion are associated with one an-
other. But there will be situations 
that require some stylish threads. 
I’m not going to slap you a list of 
what not to wear — that’s for you to 
soon figure out. But what I can do is 
give you a heads up on how to deal 
with some unpredictable situations you will encounter on campus so that you can be prepared for what-ever comes your way.
• Win Over the Weather
Even if you religiously check the 
weather app on your iPhone, you’ll still never know what Gainesville’s 
weather pattern is going to bring. 
Combine that with the reality that you are going to be walking from the sweltering heat into an overly 
air-conditioned classroom, and you 
will have to dress accordingly. I sug-gest wearing layers, like tank tops and thin cardigans — things you can either peel off or pile on. Wrap 
a summer scarf around your neck 
while commuting, and then drape it around your shoulders as a shawl to keep warm in class.• Free Tees
Local businesses cater to the fact 
that college students love free any-thing. You will soon notice a trend 
on campus of shirts advertising ev-
erything from apartment complexes to organizations. Some of them are so common and eye-catching you’ll 
start to wonder how you missed out. 
You just have to know where they are! You can join Student Alumni 
Association for $20 and you will reap the 
benefit of free BEAT 
T-shirts for all home 
football games. Also, be aware of the tables set up in the Reitz Union 
Colonnade. There, dozens of realtors 
and clubs set up displays to attract fu-ture residents or members. So all the students wearing the Estates T-shirt that reads “I Know You Want This” 
— none of those kids live there.
• Sleep Pretty
You may be used to sleeping in 
either worn in T-shirts or nothing at 
all. But living in a town where most 
of your friends are within a five-mile 
radius, you’re going to have to start caring about how you look at all hours of the day, and that includes 4 a.m. You never know who is going to come knocking on your door after a late night, or when your dreams will 
be disturbed by an unexpected fire 
drill. 
• Rules With the Roomies
You and your roommates are go-
ing to be sharing a lot of things, but clothing does not have to be one of 
them. It may sound like a good idea 
to extend your closet to their side of the room, but unless you are both on the same page about borrowing, it’s a 
recipe for drama. When it comes to 
sharing clothing, karma doesn’t nec-essarily apply.   
You can deal with this one of two 
ways. Either lay down the rules, or 
learn to let go. Lending out my favor-
ite dress shirt may have tugged on my heart strings for a split second, but the unease went away and that shirt 
was always back on my hanger within 
a day. And for those few times when my borrowed silk dress drank some beer, or my white sandals swept the floor of a fraternity house, I realized 
it was much easier to laugh about. 
And I cannot lie, it doesn’t hurt 
knowing that it’s my dress she’s wear-
ing in her new Facebook picture.

Gainesville food joints offer diversity, familiarity for allwhere to go
JON SILMAN
avenue writer
    You are new to Gainesville and perplexed by 
the throngs of drunk college hooligans swaying 
by your doorstep at 2 a.m. Or, you are back from 
your forced exile from home-cooked meals and motherly laundry service, and all of a sudden are forced to fend for yourself once again. 
Somehow, you met someone who can stand 
to be around you for more than a class period at a time, and you’d like to show him or her a good time. Alas, the options are many and your knowledge is limited. Where to take that special someone? Someplace that will impress them but 
also say something about the type of person you 
are. Somewhere that speaks to you. Do not fret — like a good neighbor, The Avenue is here to help.  
If you are: A hipster  
Go to: The Top
This goes without saying. You love the owl 
motif and your bearded server who wears tighter pants than your sister. You love the eclectic (I hope that word doesn’t come up again) food se -
lection — the tofu triangles, the sweet potato fries and the black bean burgers. After your meal you can mosey over to the bar that has a DJ booth on the end of it and then take pictures in the photo booth, which you will immediately post on Facebook because you’re so original.   At the end 
of the night, you’ll jump on your fixed-gear bike and go home, and you won’t make a move on your date under the guise of “being respectful.” It’s another night of you and The Smiths, sad.  
If you are: An aging hipster  
Go to: Satchel’s
Satchel’s is heaven to you. It’s like the hippy 
commune you always wanted to be a part of but never could because you secretly like bathing. Where else in Gainesville can you eat in a van? 
No really, one of their tables is in a van. No credit 
cards here friend. The tips are pooled and all the aging hipster waitresses wait on everybody, com-mune style. You also will never get two plates with the same design at one table, and that speaks to your hard-won individuality. After your meal get some chocolate cake. Then you go next door to Lightnin Salvage, a store full of useless knick-knacks sure to entertain you for at least eight min-utes. You know you want that dashboard Jesus.  
If you are: In a fraternity  
Go to: The Swamp
You’ve been pounding beers at the house and 
are ready to party. It’s 10 a.m. on a Sunday, so there’s only one place to go. Oh yes, The Swamp. You and your very expensive live-in friends can really let loose here. The big screen TVs, the all-female wait staff (except for the bartender, talk about a dream job), and the drink specials speak 
to your unbridled masculinity. Don’t worry about 
the food — everything tastes like Bud Light any -
way. If you really want to get crazy, ask the man-ager to show you the moon tattoo he has on his lower back. He loves that.If you are: A freshman  
Go to: Applebee’s
You are away from home for the first time in 
your life. You want to go someplace that mom used to take you on your weekend visits. You have no idea where anything is and anytime you venture more than a mile from your place you spend three hours trying to find your way back. 
Applebee’s is your shining beacon of familiarity 
in the sea of uncertainty 
that is your life. You get the something Rollup or another and use Map-quest on your iPhone to slowly find your dorm. Welcome to Gainesville.  
If you are: Poor  
Go to: El Indio
You are not one of 
the lucky ones. Daddy doesn’t pay your rent. Or maybe he does, but that’s all he pays. You are forced to buy your own food and yes, you could go grocery shopping but that would mean cook -
ing and cleaning, so God no. Your solution is easy friend. El Indio offers fine Mexican cuisine in a semi-clean outdoor environment. And the price is right. You can get tacos for two bucks.  
If you are: Environmentally conscious  
Go to: Buddha Belly
You are a tree-loving environmentalist. You talk 
about “making a difference” and “voting with your mind and not your dollar.”   You drink foreign wine 
and aged cheese because your sophisticated pal-ate demands it. You show documentaries at your house about climate issues and talk for hours to hear the sound of your own voice pretending to actually give a shit what your friends are say -
ing. Your one redeeming quality is your choice of restaurant, Buddha Belly. They have the option of 
real silverware and you can bring your own con-
tainers so you don’t have to use Styrofoam. They send your order to the cook on a zip-line across the restaurant, which probably saves paper.  
If you are: Drunk at 2 a.m.  
Go to: Flaco’s
You just had a wild night downtown, and 
you’re wasted. You lost all your friends but you stumble into a corner store with bright inviting 
lights and the sweet smell of Cuban coffee. You 
close one eye to see straight and order the godfa-ther and a huge coffee. You play some old-school arcade games while you wait for your food and before you know it you’re sober enough to text your friends, who have actually been in the place the whole time — you were just to drunk to notice. On the way out, grab a guava pastry and feel like the night has just begun.
This information was provided with help from 
Gainesville residents to maximize your dining expe -
riences and get the most out of your special town. Tom Miller, Gainesville’s own Andy Warhol, would like to leave you with one final piece of advice: If you like sushi, go to Japan. No really, go to Japan.

UF running back Emmanuel Moody has battled injury throughout 
his time in Gainesville. He is now rehabbing a sprained ankle.By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator.org
Emmanuel Moody still thinks he can make a big 
impact for the Gators. 
If he does, it will be a long time coming. 
Moody transferred to UF from USC after his 
freshman season, which ended early due to an an-
kle injury, the first of his career. 
“It’s one of those deals where I never thought I 
would be that guy because I’ve never had any inju-ries all through high school, never had it until later my freshman year,” Moody said. “It’s just unfortu-nate. It has been unfortunate.”
The injury with the Trojans may have been his 
first, but it certainly wasn’t his last. 
Moody has battled a series of ankle injuries and 
a broken hand since moving to Gainesville, and he started off fall practice on the stationary bike rather 
than on the field. 
Though he is still not 100 percent, he has started 
practicing in a more limited role and is trying to re-
main upbeat about his chances of contributing this fall.
“There’s times where I can come in (the training 
room) every day like, ‘What the heck am I doing in here?’” Moody said. “But it’s not going to do me any good. I’ve got to keep a positive attitude and 
just keep going. 
“I’ve been doing this for 15 years now and this is 
all I know what to do is just keep going when I face 
adversity.”
The latest bit of adversity came a week before 
practice was set to begin when an impromptu work-out with Aaron Hernandez got overly competitive. Moody was playing one-on-one defense on the big 
tight end with freshman Jordan Reed throwing 
passes. 
Reed threw a high ball and Moody jumped to make the play before coming down on Hernandez’s 
ankle. 
Last season, the 6-foot, 210-pound running back 
rushed for 417 yards on 58 carries — 116 of those 
yards coming in a blowout win against The Cita-
del — in between injuries that either kept him from 
playing altogether, or pushed him further back on the depth chart as he was unable to practice. 
Circumstances have worn on Moody so badly 
that he admitted to having thoughts about quiting, 
though he never seriously considered following 
through on them.
“It’s definitely making me more mentally tough 
because there’s times where it does cross my mind — is football for me sometimes? Does God want me to continue football?” Moody said. “We all have 
times where — I’m sure you guys had times in your 
lives where — you know, you have thoughts, of course.”
Despite his seemingly endless string of inju-
ries — coach Urban Meyer has called him an “in-jury magnet” — running backs coach Kenny Carter maintains that there is a place for the tailback when-ever he gets healthy.
“It doesn’t concern me. It is what it is. It happens 
every time and you just go with it,” Carter said. “When he’s ready to go, we’ll play him. When he’s not ready to go, that’s why you recruit.”UF RUNNING BACKSMoody fights through injuries
“It’s one of those deals where I never 
thought I would be that guy because I’ve 
never had any injuries all through high 
school, never had it until later my fresh -
man year. It’s just unfortunate. It has 
been unfortunate.”

Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator.org
It’s up to Brandon Spikes 
to keep the UF linebacker tra-
dition alive and kicking.
Amid his goals of win-
ning a third national title and preparing for an NFL career, Spikes will have to do as his 
predecessors and groom re-
placements.
During Spikes’ freshman 
year, starter Brandon Siler took him under his wing and 
showed him what it took to be 
a successful middle lineback-er. The importance of hav-ing Siler — now with the San 
Diego Chargers — as a tutor 
isn’t lost on Spikes.
“Without Brandon Siler, 
I don’t think I would’ve be-come the player I’ve become,” 
he said.
Now, it’s time for Spikes 
to pass that along to freshmen 
Jelani Jenkins and Jon Bostic, 
both of whom say they’re 
more concerned with learning from Spikes this season than trying to take anyone’s start-ing job.
Bostic figures to play 
the same role Spikes did as a freshman. The 6-foot-1, 235-pounder from Wellington 
Palm Beach Central High has 
earned plenty of praise dur-ing the offseason that should translate into playing time.
“I come out every day to 
get better, but I’m also there to learn,” Bostic said. “I’m learning behind one of the best linebackers in the coun-
try, and I’m trying to watch 
what he does and do the same things he does.”
Spikes’ decision to return 
for his senior season makes the linebacker position load-ed with experience. Spikes, A.J. Jones, Dustin Doe, Ryan Stamper and Brandon Hicks were all reliable last year, though Doe is in hot water 
following a July arrest for 
driving with a suspended li-cense.
Doe was suspended from 
the team, and it’s unclear whether he’ll return in time to reclaim a starting role.
“What’s great about the 
VOLLEYBALL FAN DAYBy KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator.org
It’s hard to argue UF’s defense 
— which coach Urban Meyer said 
has a chance to go down as one of 
the best ever — has a weak link, but the one unit that seems to of-
fer up the most questions is the 
line. 
Perhaps that says more about 
the secondary and linebackers, but the tackle position is the most competitive battle for a starting 
spot on the defense. 
Juniors Lawrence Marsh and 
Terron Sanders stepped into starting roles last year and are 
the favorites to hold their posi-tions, but if they falter, freshman 
Omar Hunter and sophomore 
Jaye Howard have impressed the coaching staff in practice. 
“If they don’t go out and prac-
tice well, and they don’t play well, then they’re not going to 
play at all,” defensive coordina-
tor Charlie Strong said of the po-sition battles. 
Sanders said he feels good 
about where he stands in the pecking order, but admitted the 
competition for playing time is 
fierce. 
“I really feel as though only 
certain spots on the team are ce-mented, especially on the defen-sive front,” Sanders said. “Every 
day is a competition, and every 
day is a challenge, and every day could make or break your chances of starting or getting the bulk of the playing time.”
The end positions are more 
solidified, as senior Jermaine Cunningham and junior Carlos Dunlap have two years as starters 
under their belts. 
Strong told an anecdote at UF’s 
Media Day illus-trating the type of 
understanding that can come only with 
ample experience.
In the national 
c h a m p i o n s h i p 
game, Oklahoma faced third and 
2 with the ball on the hash mark closest to its own bench. The 
Sooners subbed in bigger per-
sonnel to try to pick up the first down, and Strong was unable to 
counter with subs of his own for 
fear of having too many men on the field or burning a timeout. 
Linebacker Ryan Stamper 
stuffed up the play for a loss, but when Dunlap came off the 
field, he had something to say to 
Strong. 
“He said, ‘Coach, we were in 
the wrong defense! We can’t run 
that defense against that person-
nel grouping,’” Strong said. “I said, ‘I never thought you would 
know that. I’m glad you did.’”
Junior Justin Trattou will be 
pushing for playing time on the outside, and a high football IQ 
could end up being the difference the coaches are looking for. 
Defensive line coach Dan Mc-
Carney said the talent is there for 
I really feel bad for all you freshmen.
You’re never going to enjoy the 
cheap, fattening, how-can-it-take-this-
long-to-take-a-hamburger-order experi-
ence that was Wendy’s inside the Reitz Union.
The old faithful institution — I swear it 
was open more hours in a day than most people are awake — is no longer with us. It is being replaced by Cheeburger Chee-burger, which I hear is a little more expen-sive with a little more quality.
Still, the UF class of 2013 never gets to 
eat at Wendy’s in the Reitz. There’s just something weird about that — I feel like you’re missing 
out on something.
Here are three tips 
to make sure you 
don’t have similar re-
grets when it comes 
to your UF athletics experience.
First of all, do yourself a favor and know 
what’s going on with the Gators. At the 
absolute, scrape-the-bottom-of-the-barrel 
minimum that means the football team (and more than, “Oh yeah, there’s that Tebow dude.”). Consider upping yourself to decent casual fan status and learn about 
the men’s basketball team.
But really, you should indulge your-
self and learn something about some of 
the smaller sports. I know I’m one of the 
biggest champions of the worthiness of 
smaller sports — i.e. you’re rarely, if ever, watching this sport on ESPN or ESPN2 — but there is something to be said for the fact that 18 UF sports made it into their 
NCAA Tournaments.
(Let me quickly plug our graphic on page 44. It’s an excellent primer to catch 
you up on all the sports that will compete during the fall.)
Second, go to the home football games. 
This sounds obvious enough, right? Yet you will know people who willingly choose not to go each week. (I apologize in 
advance for the terrible students who only 
got student tickets to sell them to the high-est bidder each week. Dante has a special circle in hell for these pseudo-ticket bro-kers.)Spikes sets standard at LB

UF offensive lineman Maurkice Pouncey started all 14 games at center in 
2008, but he could move to left guard for the upcoming campaign. 
By MIKE DiFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator.org
With the departure of seniors Phil Traut-
wein and Jason Watkins, the Gators will look 
to reshuffle the offensive line heading into the 
2009 season. 
Mike and Maurkice Pouncey are givens. 
Carl Johnson and Marcus Gilbert will be in the 
trenches as well. The last spot isn’t so black 
and white.
Johnson, who started at left guard last 
year, worked out at left tackle in the spring. 
But with the emergence of sophomore tackle Matt Patchan, Johnson could be slated for a 
move back inside despite his desire to remain 
at tackle.  
“That’s what I want, but our offense is 
predicated off middle push, so if I have to play 
guard and that’s what it takes to get another 
championship, then let’s go to Pasadena,” Johnson said.
The junior is happy to be back on the field 
after a tumultuous offseason.
Johnson underwent knee surgery a week 
after UF’s win against Oklahoma in the BCS National Championship Game.
Then, in February, he was arrested for al-
legedly violating a restraining order after he boarded a bus with his ex-girlfriend, who had filed a temporary injunction against him. All charges were eventually dismissed.
“You have to surround yourself with good 
people, strong coaching staff like the one we have here,” Johnson said. “If you got enough support behind you, you can get through any-
thing.” Patchan, who weighed just 260 pounds in 
the spring, put on nearly 30 pounds this sum-
mer and has impressed so far this fall. 
The sophomore arrived in Gainesville as a 
240-pound defensive lineman but could be a star in the making on offense.
Patchan, who hopes to eventually weigh 
in at 300 pounds, has Johnson to thank for his 
new puffed-up frame. 
“If you need to gain weight, go eat with Carl 
(Johnson),” Patchan said. “That’s the trick — 
eat like Carl eats.”
Patchan’s long arms and athleticism make 
him an ideal choice at tackle.
If Patchan can lock down a spot at left tackle 
and Johnson slides back to guard, junior Maur-kice Pouncey would remain at center.
Sophomore center Sam Robey has drawn 
rave reviews from coaches and could see time up front. 
If Robey ends up on the ball, Pouncey would 
work at guard with Johnson at left tackle. James 
Wilson should also see time in the rotation but 
could have a hard time cracking the lineup be-hind Patchan and Robey.
Only Gilbert, who is a mainstay at right 
tackle, is set in stone.Final O-line spot up for grabs
“That’s what I want, but our offense 
is predicated off middle push, so if I 
have to play guard and that’s what it 
takes to get another championship, 
then let’s go to Pasadena.”

UF opponents should prepare 
to be hit with a steady dose of light-
ning and more lightning this season, as sophomore speedsters Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey are expected to 
take the bulk of the carries out of the 
backfield.
Though neither are prototypical 
between-the-tackles runners, run-ning backs coach Kenny Carter has set lofty goals for his unit, but not necessarily any one player.
“We’re concerned about what 
we do as a unit, not what we do as 
individuals because it doesn’t mat-
ter,” he said. “If we’re productive as a unit, that’s the deal. It was the second-most productive unit in the history of Florida football last sea-son, and we intend to do better than that.”  
Demps has garnered praise from 
the coaching staff for his ability to 
do everything out of the backfield. 
He has shown a good understand-ing of the offense, the ability to pick up blitzes and has become a viable receiving option, something that has put him in contention to see a signif-icant amount of time in the hybrid position that Percy Harvin made so deadly in his time as a Gator. 
Coach Urban Meyer said Rainey 
has shown vast improvement in contributing to all areas of the game, pointing out that the running back has become more “intelligent” and “mature,” two words he joked he never thought he would use to de-scribe him. 
The other tailback who saw a sig-
nificant amount of playing time last season is junior Emmanuel Moody, who spent the first two days of prac-tice on a stationary bike while bat-
tling an ankle injury. 
Moody, who is listed at 210 
pounds, outweighs Demps and 
Rainey by about 30 pounds and is considered a better option in a more pro-style system that requires pounding the ball up the middle. 
With talk of an under-center 
package being put into the offense, it 
seemed Moody would finally have 
a chance to cement a role on in the backfield. However, there was not a single snap taken from under center by anyone other than punter Chas Henry in the first two open prac-tices, and Carter dispelled notions that Moody is the only UF runner physical enough to be effective in 
that scenario. 
“If you’re a running back at Flor-
ida and you’re productive, you’re 
going to get the ball,” Carter said.  “One person specifically, we’re not going to say, ‘OK, because we’re under center, we’re going to do this, we’re going to do that.’ The whole thing is when Emmanuel is healthy 
and ready to play, then he’ll play. 
When Chris and Jeff are ready to play, then they’ll play. One specific person because of whether we’re under center or not doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter.”
Senior Brandon James and fresh-
man Mike Gillislee will provide in-surance in the event injuries force 
the coaching staff to reach deeper into the depth chart. 
With so much emphasis on the 
success of the unit as a whole, Carter 
isn’t concerned with the prospect of losing Moody, or any other tailback, to injury. 
“One of my coaches that I 
coached for a long time ago told me, ‘You play with who you have,’” Carter said. “That’s why you recruit, so I never get nervous about that. If you’re nervous, then that means you don’t have good enough players on your roster, so at Florida you’re not going to be nervous.”
UF RUNNING BACKSDemps, Rainey anchor speedy UF running attack
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF sophomore Chris Rainey has worked on bettering his all-around game and will team with Jeff Demps 
to form one of the nation’s fastest running back duos. 
44, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 17, 2009
state of the program
It’s hard to say if there’s been a more anticipated football season in school his-
tory. The Gators enter the fall as the consensus preseason pick to win the national 
title and become the first undisputed repeat champ since Nebraska in 1994-95. There has even been talk of UF going undefeated for the first time in school history, which isn’t surprising since the team returns all but four starters from the squad that took home the crystal ball in 2008.
The offense is again led by 2007 Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow who is play-
ing in his final season and trying to cement his legacy as one of the best college football players of all time. The defense returns an extraordinary amount of depth with every starter and back-up returning from 2008 and plenty of capable freshmen ready to step in. 
Perhaps the only question mark comes from the loss of electrifying playmaker 
Percy Harvin, who left for the NFL after his junior season and was selected by the Minnesota Vikings in the first round. Defenses constantly had to pay attention to Har -
vin, allowing the Gators to make them pay by spreading the ball around.
Coach Mary Wise has led the Gators to 18 consecutive Southeastern Conference 
titles, but UF has never won a national championship despite routinely finishing as one of 
the nation’s top 10 teams. 
The Gators head into this season as the No. 9 team in the country with hopes of mak-
ing it past the Sweet Sixteen, which has become the common exit point over the last few years. 
Defensive specialist Cristina Diaz and middle blocker Kelsey Bowers are the only two 
players UF lost to graduation as the Gators supremely talented freshman class of a year ago will now have a season’s worth of experience under its belt. 
Led by National Freshman of the Year Kelly Murphy, a legitimate triple-double threat 
every night, and Colleen Ward, who emerged as a steady offense weapon from the outside, UF will still rely heavily on underclassmen for production. 
This will be the last go-around for senior Elyse Cusack, the greatest libero in school his-
tory, and the pressure to win while she still roams the back line will be great. 
This season will prove to be a big turning point for the UF women’s basketball 
program. Coach Amanda Butler enters her third season at the helm after a miracu -
lous two-year turnaround, but the Gators will be without First Team All-SEC guard 
Sha Brooks and Second Team All-SEC forward Marshae Dotson.
While lacking the star power of 2008-09, guard Jennifer Mossor returns for her 
senior year after missing most of last season with an ACL injury. Three-point specialist Jordan Jones, a South Carolina transfer, is eligible this season. Two incoming recruits pack a lot of promise as well: 5-foot-11 Ms. North Carolina Basketball Christal Caldwell and 5-foot-7 Georgia Class AAAA Girl’s Basketball Player of the Year Tes-sah Holt, both guards.
The Gators had a 10-win improvement in 2007-08 followed by a return to the 
NCAA Tournament and a top-10 finish in 2008-09. Now Butler and UF face the test of continuing to meet rising expectations.
After a season that ended in disappointment, the men’s team will have to make up 
for the loss of four-time All-American Billy Horschel. Seniors Tyson Alexander and Tim 
McKenney will be looked upon to carry the load and fill the void left by Horschel.
The young women’s team felt some growing pains last season after playing with 
a lineup full of freshmen and sophomores for most of the year. However, this summer the Gators hired a new head coach in Jan Dowling in hopes of a return to promi-nence. All-SEC junior Jessica Yadloczky will have to receive some help from talented sophomores Andrea Watts and Evan Jensen if the team wants to bounce back from a difficult year.UF is coming off of a second straight year without an  NCAA Tournament appear -
ance, and became the first team since Michigan State in 1981 not to make the Big 
Dance in consecutive years after winning the national title.
With the departure of star point guard Nick Calathes, who is now playing profes-
sionally in Greece, the Gators, who finished 25-11, again enter the season with more questions than answers. 
In the backcourt, UF returns sophomore Erving Walker and has recently signed 
Israeli point guard Nimrod Tishman. The 6-foot-6 Tishman averaged more than 18 points per game in the under-18 European Championships.
UF’s season likely hinges on the development of 6-foot-10 Georgetown transfer 
Vernon Macklin and true freshman guard Kenny Boynton. 
Macklin averaged 3.4 points and 2.1 rebounds per game in 2007-08 at George-
town while super recruit Boynton put up 31 points per contest as a senior at Planta -
tion American Heritage High School.
If Macklin and Boynton pan out and the Gators continue to see growth from vet-
eran forwards Alex Tyus and Chandler Parsons, UF is good enough to play their way back to the Big Dance. 
For the last two seasons, it has been a toss up between Meghan Berlingo and 
Katie Fraine for the Gators starting goalie job.
Berlingo made the choice easy for UF coach Becky Burleigh this offseason by 
packing her bags for Washington State. 
The two rotated in goal on a game-to-game basis for most of the season, but it 
was Fraine who played every minute during their NCAA Tournament run, which prob-
ably played a big role in Berlingo’s decision.
Fraine will be aided by the return of all four starting defenders from last year 
including Lauren Hyde who has made an All-SEC team in each of her three years.
The offensive attack lost Ameera Abdullah and Megan Kerns, but returns budding 
stars Tahnai Annis and Lindsay Thompson. 
The Gators will again be ready to make a run in the NCAA Tournament and will 
try to advance past the round of 16 for the first time since 2005.
The UF women’s cross country team finished 17th in last year’s NCAA Champion-
ships, but coach Todd Morgan’s squad will have a good chance to break into the top 
10 in 2009.
The Gators lost just two runners to graduation, and after sitting out last season 
with an injury, Rebecca Lowe will be a nice addition to a team featuring 2008 SEC Female Freshman of the Year Genevieve LaCaze and junior Ali Crabb. 
All-American Jeremy Criscione reached the NCAA Championships for UF’s men’s 
team a year ago. But Criscione is gone, and the rest of the team did not qualify for the NCAA Championships. Sean Blaney and the other five seniors could have a long road ahead of them.
The No. 14 UF women’s tennis team advanced to the Sweet 16 in College Station, 
Texas, where it was defeated 4-2 by then-No. 2 Georgia. All scholarship players 
return for the fall, including No. 7 Marrit Boonstra, who notched her 50th career win before bowing out in the singles quarterfinals.
The Gators, plagued by injury in the spring, will introduce prospects Lauren Em -
bree (ranked the No. 2 recruit), Allie Will, Caroline Hitimana and Claire Bartlett.
On the men’s side, No. 11 UF hopes to build on a season that showed promise for 
the future. Like the women’s squad, the Gators started four underclassmen regularly, led by southpaw freshman Carlos Cueto (No. 25).FOOTBALL

linebacker position is you have 
them all back, with a leader in Spikes, then you have Stamper 
back, you have A.J. Jones back and 
you have Brandon Hicks,” defen-sive coordinator Charlie Strong said. “The battles are always there, and then with a young Jelani Jen-kins and Bostic, the key thing for those young kids is they have to 
watch the upperclassmen work, 
and their opportunity will come.”
Stamper has long been de-
scribed as one of the most respect-ed players on the team, but there’s 
no question who has the biggest 
impact at the position. Spikes led the Gators with 93 tackles in 2008, tied for second on the team with 
four interceptions 
and returned two of 
those for scores.
He locks down 
the middle of the field, but he’s free 
to roam and has a keen sense of where he needs to be to make a big play. Also, Spikes said he’ll be used more on the outside this sea-son to put pressure on opposing 
quarterbacks.
That makes for a dangerous 
package, one his position mates 
are ecstatic to have around.
“It made us really happy know-
ing that we had a leader coming back. It’s always a great thing to have because without a leader you can trust, you pretty much don’t have a team,” Hicks said. “Spikes 
returning really put that com-
pleteness that we needed on our defense. Instead of looking for a leader, we already have one that’s going to lead us to the promised 
land, and that’s where we plan to 
get to.”

the line to become a major factor for the highly talented 
defensive as long as they can come up with the right an-
swers to a few questions. 
“How good do you want to be? Do you want to be the 
best? Do you want to be the best to ever put on a Florida uniform?” McCarney said. “Do you want to be the best in 
the SEC? Do you want to try to become one of the best in the country?” 
“The sky is the limit for these guys.”McCarney: Talent is there
D-LINE , from page 41Yep, people go to the library or other “usually 
packed” locations in Gainesville. They often use an 
explanation that has to do with the fact that this is a 
rare time when said destination is empty.
Hello! There’s a reason why Gainesville is dead 
on game days outside of The Swamp and the sur-
rounding area. Don’t be one of these people. Ever.
Third, become a Rowdy Reptile as quickly as 
possible. What’s that, you ask? It’s the frequent fly-er program for the UF men’s basketball team. 
Attend eight home games in a year to gain access. 
Membership allows you to go online before the sea-
son and pick all the games you want to attend —  a 
major advantage over non-reptiles, who must sign up for three games at a time at a random time as-signed by the ticket office. If you’re not a Rowdy Reptile and you can’t make the sign-up time, good luck getting a seat in the O’Connell Center, espe-cially for SEC games.
Well, there you have it. Consider those the basic 
three steps to not messing up your UF athletics ex-perience. 
Surely I left some things out, but the advice boils 
down to this: Do as much as you can.
Live it up. Try things. Have fun. Be smart.All UF sporting events besides football are free to 
students, and except for men’s basketball, you don’t have to do any advance work to attend. Just show 
up and flash your Gator1. It’s just that simple.
You may not get the Wendy’s experience, but 
then again you’re probably better (and healthier) 
off without it. Just follow the three steps.phIL , from page 41FootballMONDAY, AUGUST 17, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 47

 For two weeks, Riley Cooper 
wasn’t sure he was going to play 
college football again.
The 25th-round pick in June’s 
MLB Draft was in contract nego-tiations with the Texas Rangers, and the baseball franchise wasn’t immediately sold on allowing the outﬁ  elder to return to Gainesville for his senior season.
Cooper admits he began consid-
ering life without football.
Then, the Rangers gave the 
green light, and now the 6-foot-3, 215-pound wideout is trying to catch up on the gridiron after miss-ing all of spring practice and sum-mer workouts.
“I love football. I love baseball,” 
Cooper said. “I wanted to come back and contribute for a third na-tional championship.”
Cooper said he thought he would 
feel more out of shape than he does.
Receivers coach Billy Gonzales 
complimented the senior receiver on his conditioning work and feels it’s only a matter of time until the senior is back to playing like normal.
Cooper started 12 games last sea-
son and ﬁ  nished ﬁ  fth on the team 
in receiving with 18 catches for 261 
yards.
Gonzales said Cooper’s track re-
cord would not be forgotten as start-ing spots are deciding during fall camp.
“Here’s the difference,” Gonza-
les said. “He’s a guy who’s proven himself.”
Gonzales knows his experience 
will help mold the mostly inexperi-enced receiving corps, including in-coming freshmen Stephen Alli and 
Andre Debose.
“They gotta understand what it’s 
like to play in the Southeastern Con-
ference,” Gonzales said. “They’ve gotta see somebody that’s done it before. He brings that toughness factor.”
The wideouts coach initially 
missed a late-night call from Coo-
per’s father, Larry, about the good 
news. Gonzales said he had texted Riley back and forth and had a good feeling. He was happy to learn the following morning that he would have the senior wideout who keeps things “lively” during meetings.
There was another Gator espe-
cially happy to hear Cooper was 
returning to Gainesville: his room-
mate, Tim Tebow.
Tebow said he let Cooper make 
his own decision while weighing football against baseball.
“I just let him know that we want-
ed him back,” Tebow said, “and we wanted him part of this team.”
He might have been avoid-
ing stepping on coaches’ toes, but Tebow wasn’t ready to guarantee any starting spots, even to one of his closest friends on the team.
“We’re not going to hand out a job, or you’re not going to have a job just because you had one last year,” Tebow said. “You’ve gotta come and compete. That’s what (Cooper) wants.”
For now, though, Cooper is just 
happy to be able to ﬁ  nish up his gridiron career before shifting his complete focus to baseball.
“It’s a special team,” he said. 
“I’m real excited to get back with the guys. I missed everybody.” 
Cooper back on football ﬁ  eld after signing with Rangers
 Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff 
 UF wide receiver Riley Cooper will play his senior season with the Gators after signing a contract with the 
Texas Rangers, but despite his experience, he has not been guaranteed a starting spot.

When it came time to move up to 
Gainesville and start my college career three years ago, I ended 
up living in Thomas Hall with my best friend from high school.
After a two-year break, we are living to-
gether again, and he has expressed disap-
pointment in failing to experience the UF 
sports culture.
Unlike myself, a total sports junkie per-
haps to a fault, he was never a big “sports guy” and could probably count all of the 
university athletic events he has attended 
on two hands. He never applied for season football tickets or even took home a “Row-dy Reptiles” shirt from a home basketball 
game.
“You wish you had been more involved 
now, yet you were on campus for arguably 
the greatest three-year time span at any university in the history of college sports,” 
I said to him.  
OK, so consoling isn’t my thing. 
But honestly, I feel bad for him. When I 
look back at my time here as a fan, before 
I decided I wanted to be a sportswriter, I 
remember all the experiences I had with my friends. 
I could name the football team’s third-string running back, the baseball team’s starting pitching ro-
tation and the soccer 
team’s goalie, but that isn’t what getting in-volved in Gators sports 
was about. 
It wasn’t about BCS 
rankings, half-court traps or the 6-2 vol-
leyball attack, either. 
Being a UF fan was sitting five rows up 
from the front pylon of the north end zone with a handful of friends while the Gators stomped Southern Miss during my first game in The Swamp. 
It was waking up soaking wet after 
sleeping on the O’Dome concrete for a week before the Kentucky basketball game. 
It was laughing as my friend from back 
home bought a $5 “Spurrier is a cock” T-shirt outside of The Swamp before watch-ing the most dramatic live sporting event I have ever been to, capped off with a Jarvis 
Moss field goal block to preserve a poten-
tial national championship. 
And it was road tripping to Atlanta to 
watch one of the greatest basketball teams of all time repeat in one of the most fun weekends I’ve ever had in my life. 
“This is the best weekend of our lives to 
date,” one of my friends said to me. 
Sports are part of the culture “here at 
the University of Florida,” as Tim Tebow would say. They’re a part of everyday life 
and a part of the college experience that 
everyone associates with a small, rural town like Gainesville. 
When I got a job at the Alligator I trad-
ed in my orange and blue body paint for a 
notebook, recorder and an objective view 
on all things UF-related. 
Don’t put yourself in a position to re-
gret your general sports apathy right be-
fore you graduate, or when a career deci-
sion forces you out of the stands. 
The camaraderie is something you will 
never get back, and the memories made with your friends are priceless. 
Trade in a couple nights at the library 
for a couple nights in the O’Dome, McK-ethan or Pressly.
Because even if you aren’t forced into 
a world of objectivity, med school or law school might strip you of your freedom down the road. 
You only get so many years of $70 lot-tery season tickets and free admission with a Gator1. 
You only get so many years of grilling 
up burgers, dropping a keg and playing cornhole at a tailgate just down University from The Swamp. 
And you only get so many years of do-
ing it with a bunch of friends who are just as excited about and invested in watching the Gators as you are.
My best friend from high school only 
has one more year to try to make up for ev-
erything he never took the time to explore 
in his first three, but worst of all, he has reached the point where he doesn’t have too many people to do it with. 
Many of his friends, not to mention 
himself, are in crunch time for finishing their degrees or in grad school, unable to escape the library for much more than a shower and a bite to eat. 
I was even traitorous enough to give it 
all up for a byline and a column name. 
Enjoy the epicenter of the college sports 
world while you can. 
While you still have an inordinate 
amount of friends to share it with. 
And while it’s still just a Stadium Road 
stroll from your dorm room.

UF backup quarterback John Brantley (near) attended the summer workouts 
with receivers organized by senior starter Tim Tebow (far). By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer
pkegler@alligator.org
Tim Tebow’s time in Gainesville is ticking 
down.
Three years after stepping on campus as one 
of the most highly touted recruits ever, the now-
senior has lived up to all the hype, assisting in 
one national championship and directly leading 
to another with a Heisman Trophy in between.
He isn’t letting up now.Throughout the summer, Tebow dragged his 
inexperienced receiving corps out to the practice field to work on every possible game scenario.
The calls and text messages to summon his 
wideouts came as early as 4:30 a.m. some days.
“He’s the kind of guy who will call you once. 
If you don’t answer, he’ll call you again. If you don’t answer, he’ll call you again, call you again and call you again,” redshirt senior receiver Da-vid Nelson said. “He’s a tremendous leader and a tremendous talent, but sometimes you’re like, ‘C’mon man. You’re killing my phone bill.’”
It is a sacrifice Tebow is willing to make to 
ensure the most hyped team in the country lives up to expectations. The Gators lost almost 50 per-
cent of their receiving yards with the departure 
of Percy Harvin and Louis Murphy.
This summer was all about working on tim-
ing between Tebow and the guys who will now be expected to carry the load, including Nelson and sophomore Deonte Thompson.
“It depends on how much you want to win 
and what your passion is,” Tebow said. “There are no limits. We want to do whatever it takes to 
win right now.”
Sophomore John Brantley, Tebow’s backup, 
summed up the summer workouts with him as 
“intense.”
“He tells me every day he’s really intense this 
summer,” Brantley said. “He says this is my last 
go-around at it, and I wanna do the best I can. He’s really pumped up for this season.”
While this year’s starting quarterback is all set, 
some emphasis has started to move toward the 
future with Brantley being the heir apparent to end up under center for UF in 2010.
It started last fall with Tebow taking Brantley 
with him on his victory laps after games, per-haps because Tebow wasn’t sure at that point if he would be back. The mentoring continued this 
summer as Tebow dragged Brantley out to his 
impromptu workouts with the wide receivers. 
“Since day one, he’s taught me,” Brantley 
said. “When I first got here, he’s doing stuff that’s blowing my mind, and still he’s just teaching me every day because it helps him learn and it helps me learn.”
The new addition at quarterback, incoming 
freshman Jordan Reed, did not have much to say 
after his first day of practice.
Reed, rated by Rivals.com as the 10th-best 
dual-threat quarterback recruit, appeared to be 
under a gag order after quarterbacks coach Scot Loeffler spoke to him. It is unclear why, but Reed answered questions on a wide variety of topics with variations of, “I’m just happy to be here.”
Perhaps the freshman was overwhelmed, 
similar to the feeling Tebow had when he started 
three years ago. With his final two-a-days under-
way, the senior reflected on his first one in 2006.
“Just trying to come out here and earn the 
guys’ respect and not look too stupid in front of all the leaders and all the other guys,” Tebow said. “Now, being one of those guys, it’s funny to be able to watch the freshmen out here try and not look stupid and feel comfortable and feel in.”
Now, it’s safe to say Tebow feels right at home 
in Gainesville, and he will be spending plenty of time in the football complex this fall.
He will be taking just one class during his fi-
nal football season and may rival Meyer’s work-ing hours as his college career draws to a close.
“I think we should have to punch our time 
clocks,” Tebow said with a laugh.UF FOOTBALLTebow ramps up intensity as final season approachesMONDAY, AUGUST 17, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 51

What to watch for in ‘09
What to watch for in ‘09
This season could get a little boring for Gators fans. UF enters the year as 
the overwhelming favorite to go wire-to-wire as the No. 1 team in the nation. With a weak schedule to boot, here are five pertinent questions to keep you busy until Jan. 7.
WILL THE DEFENSE LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS?
Urban Meyer has publicly said his defense has a chance to go down as one of the greatest of all time. 
• Best in UF history: 1960 — 7.4 points per game• Best in NCAA history: 1938 Duke — 0.0 ppg, 1939 Tennessee — 0.0 ppg• Key Players: Sr. LB Brandon Spikes, So. CB Janoris Jenkins, Jr. DE Carlos Dunlap
• Potential Obstacles: Defensive line depth
WHY DOES THIS RUNNING BACK UNIT HAVE A CHANCE TO BE THE MOST PRO-DUCTIVE IN SCHOOL HISTORY?
Running backs coach Kenny Carter has said that 
is precisely the goal, and with two lightning fast 
speedsters, they might just have a chance. 
• Best in UF history: 
1975 — 302.4 yards per game• Best in NCAA: 1971 Oklahoma — 472.4 ypg
• Key Players: So. Chris Rainey, So. Jeff Demps
• Potential Obstacles: Emmanuel Moody’s 
health, new faces on the offensive lineWHO WILL STEP UP AS A PASS-CATCH-ING OPTION AT WIDE RECEIVER?
Wide receiver wasn’t exactly a focal point on 
the previous national championship teams, so 
if this unit can merely put up comparable pro-
duction to the 2006 and 2008 teams, it should 
be more than enough. 
• 2006 Receiving yards: 190 yards per game• 2008 Receiving yards: 160 ypg.
• Key players: Sr. David Nelson, 
So. Deonte Thompson, Fr. Andre Debose
• Potential Obstacles: Lack of experience, 
no clear No. 1WHERE WOULD THREE TITLES IN FOUR YEARS RANK HISTORICALLY?
With a repeat national title, the Gators would 
enter the discussion for one of the greatest four 
year spans of all time. 
• College Football: 
Never
• Notable other college teams: 
• UCLA Men’s Basketball: Seven titles in a row (1967-73)
• Kentucky Men’s Basketball: 
Three titles (1948-51)
• UConn Women’s Basketball: Three titles (2002-04)
• Tennessee Women’s Basketball: 
Three titles (1996-98)
• Notable other sports teams:  
• Celtics: Eight titles (1958-66), • Bulls: Three titles (1990-93, 1995-98)• Lakers: Four titles, three titles (1984-88, 1999-2002) 
• Cowboys: Three titles (1992-95), 
• Patriots: Three titles (2001-04) 
• Yankees: Five titles, three titles (1949-53, 1998-2000)  
• Other impressive such streaks:  
Franklin Delano Roosevelt: Four presidential terms (1933-45)WHAT ARE TIM TEBOW’S CHANCES OF WINNING ANOTHER HEISMAN TROPHY?
After winning the Heisman Trophy in 2007 and finishing third in 2008, Tim Tebow 
will be one of the three top candidates for this year’s award.
• Only two-time Heisman winner: Archie Griffin (1974, 1975)
• Players who have been to the Heisman ceremony twice or more since 2000: 
Tim Tebow, Darren McFadden, Reggie Bush, Matt Leinart, Jason White, Ken Dorsey• Other contenders: Sam Bradford (Oklahoma), Colt McCoy (Texas)
• Darkhorse candidates: Zac Robinson (Oklahoma State), 
Jacquizz Rodgers (Oregon State), Jonathan Dwyer (Georgia Tech)
Alligator Sports StaffUrban Meyer says he has “extremely high ex-
pectations” for the 2009 Florida Gators. 
Just don’t ask him to expand on that.
Nothing has driven me more insane this sum-
mer than listening to Meyer and the majority of his 
players deny that going undefeated or winning a 
national championship is their goal for the season.
Meyer says the goal is to win another Southeast-
ern Conference title, and he doesn’t want his play-ers talking about an undefeated season.
“I’m hoping you don’t hear them talk about it 
very much,” Meyer said. “I think sometimes what happens is that these young guys get baited into making comments like that. That is certainly not 
one of our goals. Absolutely not. Our goal is to get 
to Atlanta, and that’s it.”
Baited into saying they want to do what every 
athlete dreams of doing, including Meyer?
Quarterback Tim Tebow is in agreement with 
Meyer, and hearing him say he just wants to win the conference makes me want to pull my hair out. It’s like hearing Michael Phelps say he just doesn’t want to cramp up or swallow too much pool wa-ter.
This is one of the most competitive guys on the 
planet. He’s leading a team that just won a national title and didn’t lose many players. And last season, we saw his true feelings about an undefeated sea-son.
Following the loss to Ole Miss, Tebow apolo-
gized to fans specifically for not going undefeated. Meyer helped drill those words into the side of The Swamp, but now, he and Tebow want no part of it.
I don’t get it. You have a good team, and deep 
down, you want to go 14-0 and win a national title. So why not say it?
Defensive tackle Terron Sanders has a theory, 
and it seems right on the money.
“I think what he’s afraid of is: If we have expec-tations of an undefeated season and we lose a game, all is lost,” Sanders said. “He doesn’t want that to happen, and he 
doesn’t want the play-
ers to feel that everything we worked for is washed down the drain because we lost one game. I think that’s the reason why he says not to mention an 
undefeated season.”
Finally, something that makes sense. I can see it 
from Meyer’s point of view, but I still don’t believe any of them when they say they just want to win the SEC. At UF’s Media Day on Aug. 11, the de-fensive players talked about setting goals of break-ing records for yardage, shutouts and first downs allowed, but they stuck to Meyer’s company line when it came to team goals.
They think they can toy with opposing offenses 
each week, but winning each game isn’t doable? Come on.
“When coach Meyer says he doesn’t want to hear 
it again, you know that deep down in the minds of players, we’ve been there,” Sanders said. “We went 13-1, and now we sit back and say, ‘Man, if we could have just won that one and gone undefeated.’ So the hope of being undefeated is in the back of our minds, but at the same time you don’t want to make coach Meyer mad. You just stay focused on the task at hand, which is making it to Atlanta.”
So everyone wants to go undefeated, but no one 
will say it. For once, I think I’d rather hear the “one game at a time” answer.
If they really don’t care about going undefeated, 
they should prove it. Lose to Charleston Southern and smile.By MIKE McCALL

UF coach Urban Meyer has 
always aimed to reload, not 
rebuild, before each season.
But with a full clip of tal-
ent already in hand, Meyer doesn’t have much reloading to do, and his talented fresh-man class is more likely to watch and learn than contrib-ute on the field.
This leaves the recruiting 
class of 2009 to deal with a tough transition from hear-
ing nothing but promises and 
hype in high school to riding the pine in college.
It can be a humbling — 
sometimes humiliating — experience, and the key is keeping expectations at a rea-sonable level.
“It’s kind of weird, but I 
didn’t really come in think-
ing I was going to go in right 
away,” said linebacker Jelani Jenkins, rated by Rivals.com as the nation’s top outside linebacker out of Olney, Md. “I pretty much knew the whole recruiting thing was BS, so it isn’t really a big deal. In my 
head, I knew that I was going 
to have to work for everything 
to gain respect because every-
one here is a great player.”Jenkins added that his goals 
for the year are to learn the Gators’ system and play a few 
times in meaningful games. 
For those who aren’t as level-headed as Jenkins, advice is just a class away. 
Second-year players like 
defensive tackle Omar Hunter have already been through the transition and are happy to help out their younger team-mates.
Before Hunter arrived on 
campus, Meyer predicted he would have a Tim Tebow-like impact as a freshman. In-
stead, he battled injury, played in just three games and didn’t record any statistics leading to 
a redshirt.
“It definitely weighed on 
me a lot,” Hunter said. “Es-
pecially when you’re hurt and you can’t do anything about it.”
None of this is to say the 
freshmen can’t have an im-pact. The Gators lost veteran offensive linemen to the NFL 
but brought in five talented 
freshmen who will all be vy-
ing for playing time, and Jen-
kins, linebacker Jon Bostic and Talented veteran team means freshmen see little time52, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 17, 2009

starting lineup.
Gators should admit their real goal
� FOUR SAFETIES FIGHT 
TO SEE THE FIELD.

Safeties coach Chuck Heater 
jokingly called himself Mother 
Teresa after practice last week.
He was referring to his abil-
ity to resurrect Ahmad Black’s career a year ago, but he could 
have been talking about his 
work with the entire secondary 
in 2008.
UF allowed an average of 
258.5 yards through the air a game in 2007 and ended the 
season on a sour note when the 
Gators let Michigan quarterback 
Chad Henne complete 25 of 39 
passes for 373 yards and three 
touchdowns albeit with two in-
terceptions.
The secondary faced plenty 
of criticism during the 2008 pre-
season, especially with Black, a cornerback turned safety, forced into use due to Dorian Munroe’s 
preseason ACL injury.
The tune is much different in 
2009 after UF allowed only 179.9 
passing yards per game last sea-
son, and the Gators return all 
four starters — Joe Haden and 
Janoris Jenkins at cornerback 
and Major Wright and Black at safety.
“It seems like every year he 
pulls a guy out,” coach Urban 
Meyer said of Heater. “He’s one 
of the best coaches in America, and we’re fortunate to have 
him.”
The battle to start at safety 
this season will be even more 
heated with Munroe recovered 
from his knee injury and sopho-
more Will Hill quickly devel-
oping into one of the defense’s 
most improved players.
Heater said Hill wasn’t re-
ally ready to play until midway through last season but finished 
the year strong while seeing 
plenty of time at the nickel cor-
ner position.
That will likely continue in 
2009 as Meyer said UF will like-
ly play a lot of three-safety sets 
to maximize the Gators’ talent.
“We want to make sure we 
have creative ways to have (Hill) on the field because he’s going Defensive backs

How do you replace a guy who 
is irreplaceable?
Percy Harvin led the Gators’ 
running backs and wide receivers 
in receptions (40 for 644 yards), rushing yards (660) and total touchdowns (17) last season.
Urban Meyer’s “Percy Posi-
tion” will likely be filled by a com-mittee of speedsters.  Tailbacks Jeff Demps and Brandon James and freshman wide receiver An-
dre Debose should all get a chance 
to audition for the role.
Demps’ pass-catching abil-
ity and speed out of the backfield 
coupled with his knowledge of 
the offense make him the logical choice heading into the start of the season, but Debose, the highly touted freshman, enters his first 
year in Gainesville as the heir ap-
parent to Harvin.
After Debose signed to play at 
UF in February, Meyer dubbed 
the Sanford Seminole High stand-
out the “next Percy Harvin,” but the freshman has tried to distance himself from comparisons with the first-round NFL draft pick.
“The next Percy, I don’t want to 
hear that,” Debose said. “I know (Harvin) was a great player, but I want to kind of build my own way in Gainesville. When you look at playing styles, I can see myself in 
him a little bit. I can’t blame you 
guys at all (for comparing me to him).”
Junior tight end Aaron Her-
nandez should pick up some of the slack as he becomes more of a focal point in the UF offense this season.
Hernandez caught 34 balls for 
381 yards and five touchdowns as a sophomore last season and looks poised to make the jump into the national spotlight.
“(Hernandez) is a dynamic 
guy that can catch the ball like any wide receiver. He can make the tough catches. You can get the ball in his hands as a tailback 
and he can block at the point,” UF 
offensive coordinator Steve Add-azio said. “It’s hard to find guys like that throughout this country. 
He’s a unique guy.”
The receiving corps will be led 
by seniors David Nelson and Ri-
ley Cooper, who is back with team after signing to play professional 
baseball for the Texas Rangers.
Nelson emerged as a legiti-
mate red-zone threat at the end 
of last season and should provide Tim Tebow with a sure-handed 
option in the middle of the field, 
while speedy sophomore Deonte Thompson will stretch the field vertically for the Gators. 
“There’s a lot of people doubt-
ing us,” Thompson said. “A lot of people out there are saying Flori-da’s only weakness is the receiv-
ers. We got to go out there with a 
chip on our shoulders. We got to prove them wrong.”Freshman Debose offers similar skill set to Harvin
to be one of our best players,” Heater said. 
“Last year, we made sure he was on the field 
at the end of the season.”
Having four experienced guys at safety 
changes the tone of two-a-days as well.
“You know what they can do,” Heater 
said. “The challenge is to get them to do it again and then to get them to do it better. It’s easy to get distracted and forget about how 
you got there.”
The corner position should have plenty 
of depth as well, with Jenkins and Haden returning and Moses Jenkins and Markihe Anderson the likely backups. Redshirt fresh-men Adrian Bushell and Jeremy Brown 
could also see significant time.
Heater doesn’t worry about bruising egos 
with playing time.
“I tell them, ‘You earn the right to play, 
and our job is to find ways to get them on the 
field and play,’” Heater said. “I’ve always 
prided myself on that. Honestly, it’s rare to have a situation where you have everyone 
deserving to play.
“If that happens, that’s great for the 
Gators.”Jenkins, Haden lead way at cornerAndrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
UF wide receiver Andre Debose is expected to make a big contribution at wideout this fall, and the 
Gators hope he will replace some of Percy Harvin’s offensive output.
UF WIDE RECEIVERS
running back Mike Gillislee will prob-
ably see the field as well.
Receiver Andre Debose is sur-
rounded by the most hype, as hopes abound that he can fill the dynamic role left behind by Percy Harvin. If Debose has injury problems or a slow start, he could get buried under the weight of enormous expectations, just as Hunter was.
“I talked to Debose one day last 
week about how he was recruited like 
me and not to let it get him down,” 
Hunter said. “All that stuff is over 
with, so now it’s time to come in and play.”Debose faces loftiest expectations

UF junior Joe Haden might get his hands on the ball even more of-
ten this season as he’s been practicing in the Wildcat formation.
By MIKE DiFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator.org
It was like a scene out of a mov-
ie.
Joe Haden picked up a ball and 
tossed it across the practice field to 
UF coach Urban Meyer.
“That thing came at me, tight 
spiral and hot. I said ‘Do that 
again.’ He did, and ever since then Scot (Loeffler, UF quarterbacks coach) has been talking to me about it,” Meyer said.
Meyer was so impressed with 
the cornerback’s arm that he opted to name Haden the team’s new Wildcat quarterback this fall. 
Last year, Percy Harvin was 
used in the Wildcat in order to give opposing defenses a different look, and in 2007 Jarred Fayson, who has 
since transferred to Illinois, took a 
few snaps in the formation.
The Gators have proven they 
can excel without a traditional 
running back carrying the ball. 
Harvin ran for 1,852 yards and 
19 touchdowns in three seasons at UF, with many of those carries 
coming after taking a direct snap 
from behind center.
The junior defensive standout 
is no stranger to playing with the 
ball in his hands.
Before moving to cornerback 
as a freshman, Haden starred as a quarterback at Maryland’s Friend-
ly High.
Haden, the first true fresh-
man to start at cornerback for UF on opening day (2007), threw for 2,783 yards as a high school se-nior, set a Maryland public school 
record with 7,371 career passing 
yards and tied the career mark for touchdown passes with 80.
“I can really throw,” Haden 
said. “I used to really play quarter-back. It’s not like I’m a defensive 
back trying to play quarterback.”
As a high school recruit, Haden 
was sold on UF partially because 
he thought he would have a chance to play both ways. 
Now, more than two years later, 
he may finally get his chance.
“It was a little part of the plan, 
but when I got here and they had Tebow, that put an end to that,” Haden said. “I’ve always told coach Meyer I wanted to get back on that side (of the ball), even if it was just two plays or something like that. 
“When I’m playing it, running 
plays, that just brings back memo-ries.”
The All-Southeastern Confer-
ence defensive back was also slat-ed to line up at wide receiver for the Gators before being replaced in the lineup by Harvin.
Haden has started 26 games at 
corner for the Gators. 
He has 150 career tackles, 24 
pass breakups and four intercep-tions — including an 88-yard re-turn against Georgia last year.
The 5-foot-11, 190 pound Ha-
den has been staying after practice 
to throw with quarterbacks Tim 
Tebow and John Brantley and says 
there is a very real chance he could 
put the Heisman Trophy winner 
on the sideline for at least a couple plays each game.
But Loeffler said he has not 
worked with Haden in practice, which could mean that Haden will be doing a lot more running than throwing despite his high school credentials. 
Haden said he has worked with 
Loeffler and knows nine plays, all of which are run out of the shot-
gun formation. The junior, who 
once clocked a 4.34 40-yard dash at a high school scouting combine, might just be the newest wrinkle to the UF offense.

job),” Haden said. “I’m going to borrow it for a second.”Haden takes snaps in Wildcat

Imagine what it must be like to 
be Stephen Alli. 
A few months ago, he was 
a soon-to-be high school senior — 
a basketball prospect with just a single season of organized football 
under his belt. 
Now, he’s the Gators’ least 
experienced scholarship football player.
When Urban Meyer saw Alli at 
the Friday Night Lights football camp in July, he was wowed by 
the 6-foot-6 receiver’s raw athletic ability. 
So much so that he offered him 
a scholarship on the spot.
Alli was supposed to be the 
latest commitment of the 2010 re-cruiting class, and plans were in the works for him to enroll at UF 
this spring.
But after reviewing his high 
school transcript, advisors discov-ered that he had already passed 
the 16 core courses required for eligibility and that he had earned 
enough credits to graduate.
When the coaching staff learned 
the 18-year-old native of Toronto was eligible to enroll in college 
this fall, it jumped at the chance to bring him to Gainesville and start 
his career with the Gators. 
The freshman enrolled so late 
that he doesn’t even have a room-mate.A l l i ’ s 
situation is unique, but 
he isn’t the first high 
school foot-
ball player to make the 
jump to col-
lege a year early.
F o r m e r 
Evangel Christian (Shreveport, La.) quarterback John David Booty left 
after his junior year of high school 
to enroll at USC in 2003, and for-mer Louisville defensive tackle and 
eventual first-round NFL selection 
Amobi Okoye enrolled in college when he was just 16 because a 
placement test allowed him to skip 
fifth and sixth grade.
Alli left Toronto and enrolled 
at Proctor (N.H.) Academy in 2008 to improve his college basketball stock. He had offers from Baylor, 
Harvard and Penn.
He played just one year of 
American high school football at Proctor — mostly for fun.
But when he caught seven 
touchdown passes on just 13 catch-es last year, he brought in football 
offers from Stanford, Connecticut and Harvard. 
“He’s only played one year of 
football, but he’s here because we think he’s good enough,” UF wide receivers coach Billy Gonzales 
said.
Alli grew up with the Canadian 
version of the sport — one that includes just three downs, differ-
ent field dimensions and receivers constantly in motion before the 
snap.
“It’s like learning a new lan-
guage,” Alli said. “It’s a different environment than I have ever ex-
perienced. My biggest challenge right now is just learning how to 
play. It’s a lot different than high 
school.”  
At this point, Alli is prob-
ably more prepared to play in the O’Connell Center than Florida Field. 
A redshirt season is almost a 
forgone conclusion.
Alli’s a project, but he’s one that 
could pay big dividends for the Gators in the future. 
“Normally when you get a tall, 
rangy athlete like that he’s not an explosive guy, but (Alli’s) athletic. He’s got great quicks,” Gonzales 
said.
Alli arrived in Gainesville on 
Aug. 4 and suited up for his first practice with the Gators two days 
later.
“He’s walking around right 
now like he’s on Mars,” Meyer said.Young Alli working to adjust to new game

UF quarterback Tim 
Tebow is facing some seri-
ous competition for the role of top motivational speaker in the Gators’ locker room.
To help keep his team 
focused, UF coach Ur-ban Meyer has brought in championship coaches Bill Belichick and Doc Rivers in the past, and he added to that list Monday by invit-ing ESPN analyst Lou Holtz, who coached Notre Dame to a national title in 1988 and was inducted into the Col-lege Football Hall of Fame last year.
“[Holtz’s message was] 
that we’re a blessed team with a lot of good athletes, but it doesn’t really matter if we don’t go out every day and prepare to win,” Tebow said. “‘What are you do-ing right now to prepare to win? Winning doesn’t come in January, it comes right now, every day you step on 
the field you have to get bet-
ter.’”
Meyer said Tuesday he 
planned to bring in more 
speakers in the coming weeks — including former Indianapolis Colts coach and 
Super Bowl 
winner Tony D u n g y — and he will c o n t i n u e to rely on friends like 
UF basketball coach Billy Donovan.
“We’re very careful about 
who we allow to speak to our team,” Meyer said. “I have some very confident friends — Bill Belichick is one and (Utah coach) Kyle Whittingham is another — and I run things by them all the time. I have a little circle of guys who I constantly am on the phone with.”
