Billy Joel speaks to a packed house at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts on Thursday night. He per-
formed several songs and answered questions from the crowd about his career and the music business.

The loudspeakers played Wings 
and The Clash moments before Billy 
Joel walked on to the stage. Then the lights ﬂ  ickered, and the at-capacity crowd at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts roared.
“I hope no one is assuming this is 
going to be a concert,” he said.
Joel stood onstage between two 
pianos and in front of a gong Thurs-day night for Accent’s “Billy Joel — An Evening of Questions & An-swers … And a Little Music.”
He looked like a college professor 
in a dark sweater, jeans and a base-ball cap, and he used a green laser pointer to pick audience members.
A woman asked if he was going 
to tour again.
“If I get the vibe, I’ll do it,” he 
said, his voice loud and deep as he waved his hands around while he talked. “I like to be at home with my doggy and my girlfriend du jour.”
Someone else asked about sing-
ing and playing at the same time. He paused, cocked his head, and said “well,” and walked to the piano. The crowd roared again.
He played “Summer, Highland 
Falls” with his left hand. Then his right. Then he played them both at the same time, his voice ﬂ  oating eas-ily, ﬁ  lling the space.
Throughout the almost three-
hour show he played pieces of other famous tunes: “New York State of Mind,” “She’s Always a Woman” and “Vienna.”
A 24-year-old student named 
Ori Eizenberg raised his hand. The business and animal science major wanted to jam. Joel said yes. He ran to the stage and they played a 12-bar blues progression together.
“Never in my life did I think this 
would happen,” Eizenberg said. “It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportu-nity . Sometimes you just got to go for it.”

� STUDENT WAS TALKING TO 
THE PREACHER’S CHILDREN.

A preacher shoved a 19-year-old UF 
student on Turlington Plaza on Thurs-
day.
Matt Bourgault, who goes by Broth-
er Matt, pushed philosophy sophomore Christian Chessman after telling him to stay away from his two sons, whom Bourgault brought to campus.
Chessman gave this account:One of Bourgault’s young sons 
handed Chessman a ﬂ  ier as he was walking by.
Chessman started talking to the 
boy, asked whether he was hungry and bought him food from Chick-ﬁ  l-A. When another preacher called to the children to stop talking to Chessman, he walked a few steps to some bike racks and the boys followed.
Chessman then walked away to 
introduce himself to Elizabeth Arm-strong, who came to support Bourgault and the other preachers.
After telling her he is a Christian, 
Chessman asked if he could talk to the children. Chessman said Armstrong said yes. Armstrong denied giving him permission.
When Chessman went back to talk 
to the children, Bourgault called to his sons to stop playing.
He called Chessman “effeminate” 
and “evil.” Bourgault stepped within a foot of Chessman, who told the preach-er he was uncomfortable with how close he was getting. Chessman said Bourgault said, “Good. I want you to be uncomfortable.”Preacher shoves Christian

Shortly before 9 p.m. Wednesday , two men 
stepped into a Stoneridge Apartments living 
room, their faces masked by bandannas, hold-ing guns. The residents inside thought it was a prank.
Sixteen UF students were playing Bible 
Jeopardy. They were discussing the relation-ship between Jacob and Isaac when the strang-ers walked in. The room went quiet.
“We were waiting for the punchline from 
the prank,” said a student who lives in the apartment. “The punchline was almost a punch itself.”
The two men demanded — not loudly, but 
ﬁ  rmly — the students’ belongings. They took four laptops, three cellphones, wallets and purses. Their actions led to four arrests and a standoff that lasted about seven hours.
Marcus S. Brantley , 21, and Larance C. Scott, 
21, were charged with home invasion robbery and false imprisonment. Martin L. Cadet, 23, who allegedly drove the getaway car, received the same charges.  
Cherrion L. Williams, 18, was also in the 
car, and was arrested on an outstanding war-rant from Orange County . Williams and Cadet have a 1-year-old daughter together, according to Gainesville Police. The Florida Department of Child Services took the baby.
The man who lives in the apartment, a ﬁ  rst-
year medical school student who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retribution, said the robbery didn’t last long — two minutes at the most.
Brantley and Scott rummaged through 
their hostages’ pockets and sorted out the goods. They inspected cellphones and kept the expensive ones.  
Minutes later, one student grabbed his 
phone and dialed 911.
Shortly after 9 p.m., a white Mustang sped 
into the parking lot of the Gateway at Glades apartment complex. Brantley hopped out, still wearing his bandanna, and ran upstairs carry-ing a laptop and some bags, according to po-lice. The others followed.
Ofﬁ  cers in the area ﬁ  gured out the suspects 
ran into a third-ﬂ  oor apartment.
GPD knocked on the door. Lights were 
turned off, and blinds shifted. Nobody an-swered.UF students robbed at gunpoint

The women gathered at a 
home in November 2009 for a four-hour simplified poker-and-bridge afternoon over sand-wiches and pastries when police arrived, she said Thursday.
“They were playing with 
only very small sums of money, just to make it interesting,” Dia-kantoni said. “It’s silly for police to concern themselves with such trivial games when there are more serious things they should pursue.”
She said some women were 
frightened by the police raid in the coastal town of Limassol and attempted to flee. Others didn’t realize what was going on — in-cluding one woman who asked police to wait until she had fin-ished playing her hand.
Diakantoni said two of the 
women have since died and an-other two are in a nursing home. Her mother, Eftychia Yiasemi-dou, was reluctant to go to court but will if her doctor approves it. Most of the women are simply amused by the affair, she said.
“My mother has never done 
anyone harm, and we hope she continues playing because it keeps her mind sharp,” she said.

98-year-old and about 40 other elderly women to court to face gambling charges after raid-ing the women’s weekly poker party.
The women, who are most-
ly in their 70s, were stunned to receive a court summons this week — more than two years after the raid — said Yioula PARTLY

� THE ORGANIZATION WAS 
PROTESTING THE SENATOR’S EMPLOYMENT.
BENJAMIN S. BRASCH
Alligator Writer
Skye Schmelzer ripped off strips 
of duct tape and stuck paper after 
paper to the front door of Tigert Hall.
When she and 12 others finished, 
65 professor evaluations papered the windowed doors with written curses and complaints, all aimed at a Florida senator.
As part of the National SDS Day 
of Action for Education Rights, members of Students for a Demo-cratic Society encouraged students to fill out professor evaluation forms Thursday to protest the hiring of Sen. Mike Haridopolos, UF lecturer and Florida Senate president.
Those who protested said they 
dislike Haridopolos’ stance on cuts to university budgets and other leg-islation, including his opposition to a bill that would have allowed stu-dents whose parents are undocu-mented to pay in-state tuition.
Haridopolos has stressed the im-
portance of budget cuts before, such as when he came to speak at Pugh Hall about a $3.6-billion state bud-get cut on Feb. 11, 2011.“It is hypocritical of our admin-
istration to be against the cuts but still hire Haridopolos,” said Conor Munro, a 20-year-old history and economics sophomore and an event organizer.
Haridopolos was paid $75,000 
last year, according to the UF Detail of Salaries.
Students and two professors 
filled out about 65 professor evalua-tion forms about Haridopolos.When asked what personal qual-
ities or teaching skills of the instruc-tor contributed to the success of the course, some answered: “Being an asshole,” “Mike Haridopolos does not care about brown people” and “SDS Rules, Haridopolos drools.”
Some wrote, “Worst typos in 
PowerPoints,” “Get out of my uni-versity ,” “Swagtivism” and “He is awful!”
For the course name and number, 
some students wrote: “Budget Cuts 101” and “Corruption 2012,” with a section number of “Greed.”
Haridopolos could not be reached 
for comment.
Once the evaluations were filled 
out, Schmelzer, Munro and 10 oth-ers marched from the Plaza of the Americas to Tigert Hall with a ban-ner in tow.
Once at the doors, organizers 
covered the doors with the evalua-tions.
Members of the organization 
asked UF administrators to give the banner and the forms to Provost Jo-seph Glover, hoping they would get to Haridopolos.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
said the student protesters were en-titled to their opinions.
“We will let them express their 
opinions in this way,” she said.

About 60 faculty evaluation forms hang on the doors and windows of the main entrance of Tigert Hall 
on Thursday afternoon.
Superfund Site
ADRIANNA PAIDAS
Alligator Writer
Susan Fairforest stood in front of the 
Gainesville City Commission dressed in a 
floor-length black dress. She had a sheer, black veil drawn over her face.
Gripping a sheet of paper, she read the 
names of about 15 people who lived and died in the Stephen Foster neighborhood during the last 30 years. All of them, Fair -
forest said, died from pollutants that leaked into their homes and bodies from the nearby Cabot-Koppers Superfund site, an area that was declared hazardous by the U.S. Envi-ronmental Protection Agency in 1984.
About 20 residents sat at the commission meeting Thursday night, all of whom were dressed in black.
Four of the residents berated the com-
mission for using grant money to fund art exhibits and festivals to commemorate the Superfund site instead of using those funds to help residents relocate from their contam-inated homes.
“We need help,” said Maria Parsons, a 
neighborhood advocate. “We don’t need more art festivals. We need environmental justice.”
City Commissioner Randy Wells said he 
understood their angst, but they should not get mad at their neighbors who are working to put on the exhibits and other art projects.
“They are acting out of every bit of sin-cerity,” Wells said. “The whole point of these things is for us not to forget that there is social injustice going on.”
For about 30 years, residents have been 
dealing with health concerns as a result of the plant that was once the site of wood treat-ment and charcoal production facilities.
The EPA determines the cleanup of the 
Superfund site. Residents of the Stephen Foster neighborhood said they will continue to hold the city accountable for not relocat-ing residents from the area.
The city took part in making suggestions 
to the EPA that shaped a 703-page cleanup plan released by the EPA in February 2011.
Parsons said residents will be at future 
commission meetings reading the names of those who have died in the neighborhood as a result of high toxicity levels in the air and in their homes.
“Our neighborhoods have emptied out,” 
Parsons said. “This puts a human face to those who we’ve lost in our community.”

Shortly after midnight Thursday , 
one of the men in the Stoneridge apartment still did not know he had been robbed. He slept through it.
The man, a third-year drawing 
student who also asked to remain anonymous, pulled all-nighters on Monday and Tuesday. He had to ﬁ  n-ish some assignments before Spring Break, and he was exhausted.
His brother woke him around 
12:20 a.m. Some burglars took his laptop, he was told.
The man started drawing when 
he 6 years old, and he has wanted to be an artist for as long as he can re-member. He is applying for art pro-grams in New York and Chicago. He is also trying to land an intern-ship with Pixar.  
His portfolio is ﬁ  lled with ce-
ramics and sculptures — enough to ﬁ  ll his whole apartment if he kept them, he said.
But he hasn’t. The studio on 
campus couldn’t hold all of them, so he takes pictures and disassembles them.
One arrangement, a waterfall, 
was ﬁ  ve times as big as him. It re-quired 70 pounds of paper, he said. But now it was gone. More than two years’ worth of work, all on his lap-top.
“It’s a collection of so many 
works, so many hours, so many bottles of paint,” he said. “Then, it was just thrown away.”
  
With the suspected robbers still 
inside, GPD detective Martin Hon-eycutt obtained a search warrant. Ofﬁ  cers back at the apartment con-tinued to negotiate on loudspeakers, but by 2:30 a.m., they still had not convinced anyone to come outside.
Asked how ofﬁ  cers stayed alert, 
Honeycutt said, “Coffee and keep-ing ourselves busy. You keep going. You keep going.”
Eventually , ofﬁ  cers realized 
Brantley’s girlfriend lived nearby, according to police. She contacted Brantley, and around 3 a.m. he came outside. For the next 30 minutes or so, Honeycutt estimated, the others in the apartment emptied out, one by one.
Honeycutt’s shift began at 4:30 
p.m. Wednesday, and he was still at the ofﬁ  ce at 11 a.m. Thursday . He drank four cups of coffee.
The men in the Stoneridge apart-
ment pushed through the night. One kept busy making phone calls. The other tossed and turned, con-vincing himself that everything was going to work out, that he was simply going to have to start a new portfolio.
Eventually, they both fell asleep. 
Neither remembers when. Then, at 10:30 a.m. Thursday , they awoke to a call.
Ofﬁ  cers found everything, in-
cluding the laptop with the portfo-lio.

org.Bourgault told Chessman 
to stay away from his children 
and asked him if he under-stood why.
Chessman said he didn’t. 
The preacher shoved him.
Armstrong said Bourgault 
had repeatedly asked Chess-man to leave his children alone before shoving him.  
“It was really asked kindly, 
and it became [a situation] where they had to protect them because the boundary was crossed,” she said.  
University Police respond-
ed to the incident.
Although UPD ofﬁ  cer Day-
mon Kizzar said Bourgault could be charged with bat-tery, Chessman decided not to press charges because he said he didn’t want to make life dif-ﬁ  cult for Bourgault’s children.
“I am not trying to screw 
with you guys,” Chessman said during a conversation with Armstrong.
“I want to show these little 
kids that there is a world that is not demonic that exists out-side of the world that they’re being brought up in,” Chess-man said.
Bourgault, who said he 
found his faith at college, has been preaching on college campuses for 12 years.
He said he brought two 
of his eight children to UF on Thursday as part of a home-school evangelical ﬁ  eld trip.
Bourgault declined to com-
ment on his conversation with Chessman.
John Planas, an 18-year-
old political science freshman, was one of about 25 bystand-ers who watched the situation unfold.
“Personally, I think it’s [the 
preacher’s] fault for bringing his children here,” Planas said. “I just don’t like children be-ing involved in this stuff.”

UF Spring Break stragglers 
will have to deal with reduced 
bus service during their week off.  
From Saturday to March 11, 
Regional Transit Service will re-duce or suspend some of its city and campus routes, according to an RTS news release.  
Ten city routes won’t run 
during the break: 21, 22, 27, 28, 29, 38, 39, 46, 62 and 76.  
Some of these routes connect 
UF to residential areas, such as Lexington Crossing, Eagle Trace and the Estates. Later Gator, the Campus Shuttle and campus route East/West Circulator 126 won’t run during Spring Break either.
Regional Transit Service will 
also offer reduced service on 13 city routes: 1, 9, 10, 12, 13, 16, 17, 20, 23, 34, 35, 36 and 43.  These include routes connecting UF to Hunters Run Apartments, Butler Plaza and FloridaWorks, all of which are about 2.5 miles from the university.  
But 10 routes — 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 
11, 15, 24, 25 and 75 — and all city weekend routes will follow their regular schedules.

Silver Airways will host direct flights from 
Gainesville to Orlando and Tampa starting in April.
The airline service will start flights on April 15, the 
company announced Wednesday in a news release.
Gainesville Regional Airport does not currently 
offer flights to Tampa or Orlando. The airport has 
flights to and from Miami, Atlanta and Charlotte, N.C.
The company added the extra flights so travelers 
could get to Gainesville more easily when using Sil-ver Airways to fly across the country or the world, the release stated.
The company is selling $49 one-way tickets for 
each destination as an introductory sale.
The launch of the new flights coincides with the 
company’s relocation of its maintenance department to Gainesville.
Silver Airways announced in January that the 
company would move its maintenance department to Gainesville Regional Airport, a move that is ex-pected to create about 60 jobs.
The move will be finished by April, the release stated.

24% NOToday’s question: Have you ever argued with a          
Turlington preacher?
Friday’s question: Have you ever eaten 
at Satchel’s Pizza? Only a few more hours before your brief dose of free-
dom and relaxation begins.
Yes, it’s the Friday before Spring Break, but we ask that 
you use your last shred of focus to read our traditional 
week-ending piece.
We’ve got some fun stuff to talk about, but we also have 
an important message.
That brings us to this week’s putting-that-road-trip-on-
hold-until-next-year-because-gas-prices-are-crazy-expen-sive edition of...
Darts & Laurels
In case you hadn’t heard, renowned Gainesville estab-
lishment Satchel’s Pizza caught fire earlier this week. Re-
pairs could take weeks, putting its employees out of work.
For starting a relief fund for his employees, we give a 
that’s-pretty-damn-cool LAUREL to Satchel Raye, the 
owner of the restaurant.
Our best wishes go out to all of Satchel’s employees as 
they deal with the aftermath of the fire.
For those of you who <3 Tim Tebow, we have some bad 
news. Apparently, the UF football legend was spotted din-ing with the not-so-musical legend, Taylor Swift.
However, there’s definitely some good news in this.That’s why we’re giving a thank-God-she-hasn’t-writ-
ten-a-song-that-sounds-like-her-other-songs-about-this-date LAUREL to Taylor Swift.
Well, not yet at least.For her YouTube video that has now become a sensation 
across the Web, we give an um-yeah-the-camera’s-on-and-you’re-kinda-in-the-shot LAUREL to Kristin Giannas.
While this video might have been embarrassing for 
some, Giannas has been a great sport about the whole thing, embracing her newfound fame.
Now, you are probably thinking, “Where are the darts?” 
A question that brings me to the whole important message bit I mentioned earlier.
Earlier this week, Jason Tiemeier announced his resig-
nation from Student Senate without explanation.
If you remember, Tiemeier was spotted throwing away 
copies of the Alligator before the SG elections last week.
For failing to come clean about his transgressions, we 
throw a this-was-your-chance-to-come-forward-and-make-things-right-but-you-blew-it DART to Jason Tiemeier.
When his path within Student Government seemed to 
indicate that he was next in line to be Student Senate presi-dent, this resignation implies that he knows what he did was wrong.
We are calling on Tiemeier to be honest with himself 
and with the public. Confess your actions, and people will forgive you.
Our main concern with SG for the past few semesters 
has been the apparent lack of accountability. When no one was held responsible for the election problems last semes-ter, we were concerned.
If no one comes clean about the dirty politics of the last 
campaign, our concern will grow.
All we ask is for honesty and accountability.The ball is in your court, Jason.
Seventeenth Amendment should be repealed
I want to repeal the 17th Amendment and take away 
your right to vote for the U.S. Senate.
No, I don’t want to take your vote away because 
I’m an evil, anti-democratic person. Instead, I want to take away your right to vote for Senate because it will help re-store the republic.
The name of the game for our government is tyranny 
prevention by power decentralization. We were all taught about the horizontal checks in the federal government, namely the separation of powers between three branches and the idea that each branch has checks that balance the other two branches. Notice that we have a federal govern-ment, meaning its structure is divided between a unitary and a confederate government.
If we had a unitary government, Washington would 
make all the choices for the entire country, and there would be no state laws, only national laws. A confederacy is on the opposite end of the spectrum. If we had a confed-eracy, the states would dictate to Washington. Under the precursor to Constitution, the Articles of Confederation, the central government didn’t even have the authority to tax; it depended on donations from the states to run.
The Constitution established something between a 
federal system where quasi-independent “countries” amalgamate to create a central government to make war, deal with foreign countries and issue a national currency. However, these “countries” retain a certain level of sover-eignty; states can vary their stances on issues like crime, medical marijuana, gay marriage and taxation.
Because we have a federal system, our government re-
quires vertical checks between the states and Washington. These vertical checks matter immensely because they de-termine the type of national government: unitary, federal or confederate. The framers realized this and established ideas like nullification, secession and state representation in Congress.
Unfortunately, history has judged incorrectly on every 
single one of those concepts.Before the populist 17th 
Amendment was passed in 1913, senators were elected by the state legislatures instead of being di-rectly elected by the citizens. Before the amendment passed, senators voiced the opinion of their respective states and often interacted with their states’ leg-islature and governor.
Now, because of direct election, senators represent the 
voices of millions of people who just happen to share a geographical boundary. This undermines federalism be-cause, according to James Madison, the so-called “Father of the Constitution,” the purpose of state-appointed sena-tors is to “defend themselves (states) against the encroach-ment of national government.”
Your voice is already heard in Washington: You vote 
for president every four years and members of the House of Representatives every two years. To those who vilify this argument as undemocratic: What about the Supreme Court? Should we elect them, too?
The 17th Amendment should be repealed because the 
status quo means elections in which the outcome is dic-tated by media, large corporate donations and PAC’s.
What we need is less of that and more checks on the 
rapid expansion of Washington. Senate, as a meeting of “state ambassadors,” would accomplish this. Do you think all these regulations and (sometimes unfunded) mandates would be piled on the states then?
When the historical dust settles, the 17th Amendment 
will be remembered as one of the last blows leading to the death of federalism in our republic. Luckily, amendments can be repealed, and in the case of the 17th Amendment, must be repealed.

Columnist wrong about 
admission decisions
Diversity at UF is a fairly 
recent phenomenon, barely half a century old. It is a luxu-ry that we enjoy as a result of the active measures taken by the first students and adminis-trators who fought for minor-ity admittance to UF.
Hispanics make up 22 
percent of the population in Florida, while African-Amer-icans comprise 15 percent. In 2010, the National Center for Education Statistics reported that Hispanics/Latinos made up 16.5 percent of the Student Body at UF, while African-Americans made up 9.4 per-cent. 
Considering that minori-
ties pay taxes to fund this state-run institution, it is the university’s responsibility to ensure their numbers are rep-resented. Still, various struc-tural issues remain that keep minorities from attending UF.
California was applauded 
for its lack of racial consider-ation, but it should be noted that Hispanics make up more than 37 percent of the popu-lation and less than 16 per-cent of the student bodies at UCLA, Berkeley, San Diego, Davis and several other state campuses — hardly a sign of diversity.Affirmative action was 
initially established to com-bat gender as well as racial inequalities. However, it did not favor race or gender to achievement. Last year, more than 82 percent of the incom-ing class had GPAs above 4.0, making UF’s admissions stan-dards one of the most com-petitive in Florida. These stan-dards have continued to rise during the past three years, despite the question of race in the admissions application.
Asking a student’s race 
does not handicap the univer-sity or the student. The uni-versity, if for no other reason, should keep the race question for statistical purposes be-cause, unfortunately, race and ethnicity are still factors in American society today.
In the end, the university 
speaks for itself. The admis-sions website clearly states: “All applicants who meet requirements and standards will be considered equally for admission to any academic program, regardless of race, color, religion, gender, marital status, beliefs, age, national origin, sexual orientation or physical or mental disabili-ties.”

Letter to the Editor
Elections are but one simple measure of the demo-
cratic nature of any institution and, despite last week’s democratic performance, the UF Student 
Body would do well to question the nature of its elec-tions. An equal amount of contestation and participa-tion in a political system results in democracy. Take away some attributes of contestation or participation and the resulting system approximates an oligarchy or hegemony. This is the case at UF, where democracy is deficient in both. Election turnout was unusually high for recent times, yet dismally low (about 20 percent) by democratic standards. The more troubling issue at UF is one of a systematic lack of contestation resulting in a “competitive oligarchy,” or elections without real con-testation of an elite class.
Control of the UF Student Government has long 
been held by the Unite Party — an amalgamation of representatives from various highly organized, well-funded elite institutions. Unite boasts a long list of ac-complishments and qualified individuals in a majority government that also controls the executive. It is effec-tive in political campaigning and governing as mea-sured by its ability to consistently gain and maintain power in the political system. 
It could be argued that the elected Unite represen-
tatives are servants of two sets of distinct, and often conflicting, sets of interests, but that sort of petty cri-tique is not the point of this column. Political parties are supposed to represent narrow sets of interests. It is not Unite’s fault that it has learned to “play the game” better than anyone else.
Unite claims a record of worthy accomplishments 
that might make most students happy, but it is easy to have such a record when one must (at the very least) effectively govern to maintain political power in a de-mocracy or risk regime change in the next election. 
What the Student Body and Unite supporters miss 
is that when one party has been in power for so long, it becomes complacent and only interested in maintain-ing power, not improving its record of governance. 
More competitive elections, after several iterations 
of regime change, force parties to provide better for the well-being of their constitu-ents. It forces parties to become more sensitive and responsive to the needs of the many.
Unite has become so good 
at getting elected that it is undermining the democratic process at UF. There are no institutional measures in place to secure democracy when such a highly orga-nized group is in control. 
Three possibilities would create a more democratic 
system at UF: victory by another party, directly chal-lenging Unite at the polls, complacency and reduced quality of governance by Unite (leading to the first pos-sibility) or online voting in Student Body elections. 
Of the three, only online voting would work. Unite 
is unlikely to let go of the reins, and challengers would still have to face a well-organized political machine. 
Online voting would be cheap, secure and deliver 
huge increases in participation, providing several “new” requirements for political parties: informing the electorate, increased accountability and greater compe-tence. The needs arising from online voting would be a victory for the Student Body and any future party — a more democratic system and better political parties.
Unite will almost surely lose in the first online vot-
ing election because the vast majority of students are not represented or mobilized by Unite. It will staunch-ly oppose this change, but it should realize it will be a good thing for all parties in the long run, including Unite. It will force all parties to become better, facilitate the creation of new parties to represent the diversity of UF’s Student Body and give rise to a more democratic process.
A shift in the balance of power is a real possibility 
with online voting. If Unite really cares about the Stu-dent Body and not just controlling power in Student Government, it should support this call for online vot-ing. Let’s have an online referendum for online voting and discover what the Student Body really wants out of its political parties and system.

Sports Extra
David Carr / Alligator
Florida pitcher Hannah Rogers picked up the win Thurs-
day, throwing a one-run, three-hit complete game. 
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Writer
 
Thankfully for the Gators, the team 
with the most hits does not always 
win.
No. 3 Florida (14-1) struggled Thurs-
day evening against Eastern Michigan, collecting a season-low two hits. 
The Gators also tied their worst 
run-output of the season with two, but their low offensive output was still good enough to notch their 14th win of the season.
The Eagles (2-8) took the home team 
to extra innings, and even threatened to score the go-ahead run in the eighth. 
However, sophomore Hannah Rog-
ers (9-0) shut down EMU when need-ed. She gave up one run and three hits in eight innings, while also striking out the second-most batters in a game in her career with 11. 
No strikeout was as electrifying as 
her final one, sitting down a batter in the eighth with two outs and a runner on third.  
“It was a big moment for the game,” 
Rogers said. “It was good to get out that last batter because you never know what might have happened after that.”
It was an unusually soft-hit dribbler 
by junior Brittany Schutte that sent ev-eryone home. 
EMU first baseman Lindsay Smith 
froze and mishandled the ball, allow-ing Jess Damico to cross the plate from third. Even with the game ending on somewhat of a flukey play, coach Tim Walton said he will take a win.
“We still have room for improve-
ment, but a win is a win. ... We don’t get disappointed in ‘W’s, that’s just getting selfish,” Walton said.
“[We] find a way to get it done. 
There were some nice things that hap-pened . . . just not a whole lot of nice things.”
Walton led his team out to play for 
the first time in five days, Florida’s lon-gest break thus far this season. How-ever, he shot down any possibility of his team getting rusty while resting. 
“We saw three different pitchers, 
and they all did a good job mixing up their speeds and locations,” Walton said. 
“At the end of the day, we got to 
go in and make sooner adjustments. I thought we hit the ball hard, but we just hit it right at some people. And that part of the game happens, too.” Gators win despite scare in extra innings 
“We don’t get disappointed in 
‘W’s, that’s just getting selfish.”

NOON ON SUNDAY IN THE O’CONNELL CENTER.

 Even after four months and 30 
games, Florida’s postseason destina-
tion hinges on the upcoming week. 
  A win Sunday against Kentucky 
followed by a deep run in the South-eastern Conference Tournament would vault the Gators up to a No. 2 or No. 3 seed in the NCAA Tour-nament, priming them for a deep March run. 
  But losses to Kentucky and then a 
middling SEC opponent in the tour-nament’s early rounds would mean entering the NCAA Tournament on a four-game losing streak as a No. 8 or No. 9 seed, prompting questions about whether the Gators (22-8, 10-5 SEC) can handle life without injured forward Will Yeguete. 
  UF’s ﬁ  rst challenge will be Sunday 
at noon, when No. 1 Kentucky (29-1, 15-0 SEC) comes to the O’Connell Center to close the regular season. 
  Leading UK is freshman Anthony 
Davis, who is tops in the NCAA in blocks at 4.8 per game and evokes memories of some of the sport’s all-time greats. 
  “I think he’s deﬁ  nitely one of the 
best of all time,” UF coach Billy Dono-van said. “You start talking about Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, guys like that. I can’t probably go that far back, but certainly here in recent time, the last 20, 25 years, he’s as good as any-body that’s out there.”
  Donovan praised Davis — one  For Gators, March Madness truly begins Sunday
 The Gators are on the verge 
of their ﬁ  rst three-game losing streak in nearly 
two years.
  What once looked like the 
Southeastern Conference’s clear-cut second-best team is now prepping for a potential No. 4 seed in the league tournament.
  Right now, by its own coach’s 
admission, Florida is banged up. Will Yeguete is gone for the sea-son, and the rest of the rotation is still muddled in a laundry list of minor ankle and knee injuries. 
  It feels like the perfect time 
for a wounded animal analogy. But I can’t shake what we all saw Tuesday in Memorial Gym.
  Even in a 10-point loss to 
Vanderbilt, Florida didn’t look like a horse ridden hard and 
put away wet, a team in free fall in danger of enduring a season-e n d i n g slump  ahead of 
its second showdown with No. 1 Kentucky this weekend.
  Instead, the ﬁ  ve-headed, 
3-point-shooting monster Billy Donovan ran onto the ﬂ  oor for the second half appeared to be a different creature altogether.
  If possible, one of the NCAA’s 
best 3-point shooting teams be-came even more dangerous.  
  In the eight minutes and 46 
seconds Donovan played a small four-guard lineup coupled with forward Erik Murphy — who is second on the team in 3-point percentage — the Gators racked up 21 points to begin a scoring surge that helped grab the lead from the Commodores. Exotic 
lineup can 
keep UF’s 
hopes alive

 Florida can ﬁ  nally start talking about Ken-
tucky.
  After beating Auburn on Thursday, the 
Gators have a chance not only at redemption 
but also at notching their best win of the season when they face the top-seeded Wildcats in the second round of the Southeastern Conference Tournament today at 1 p.m.
  UF has played UK twice this season, drop-
ping both contests by a combined eight points.
  “Close — a couple possessions here and 
there,” redshirt senior guard Jordan Jones said. “We’re talking about two games we would have won against Kentucky.”
  In its two losses to UK, Florida missed sever-
al opportunities that hindered its upset efforts. The Gators shot just 18 of 34 from the free-throw line and had 46 giveaways in two contests against the Wildcats.
  “The detail work in both of our games against 
Kentucky was not good,” coach Amanda But-
ler said. “That showed up in the turnover column, that 
showed up in the rebound-ing column, that showed up in the free-throw column.”
  UF’s third crack at UK 
looks promising after the way Florida (19-11, 8-8 SEC) played in a 70-60 victory against Auburn (13-17, 5-11 
SEC) in the ﬁ  rst round of the SEC Tournament on Thursday.
  The Gators won the rebounding battle 48-41 
and held a 20-8 advantage in points off turn-overs, despite notching 14 giveaways compared to 13 by the Tigers.
  However, the difference in the game came 
from the free-throw line.
  A ﬁ  eld-goal drought lasting 7:07 helped Au-
burn cut a 16-point Florida lead down to eight at the 1:33 mark.
  The Tigers then started fouling, placing the 
Gators on the line where they put the game out of reach.
  Florida scored its ﬁ  nal seven points on eight 
attempts from the charity stripe, boosted by a 4-of-4 effort from Jones, who scored a team-high 17 points.
  “This time of year, it’s just about sometimes 
hanging on to survive long enough,” Butler said. “I think we did that.  Really thought we did a great job from the free-throw line.”  Florida drops Auburn; top-seed Kentucky awaits

THE BOOTHE REVIEW  BRYAN HOLT

 On paper, the matchup looks great. 
  No. 1 Florida (7-1) is in Coral Gables 
to begin a three-game series with No. 12 Miami (8-0) tonight at 7. The Hur-ricanes have largely controlled the se-ries when played at Mark Light Field. 
The Gators are 40 games under 
.500 (37-77) when playing at the home of the four-time national champions. With the rivalry in mind, Florida is saying all the right things. 
  “It’s going to be a huge challenge 
for us,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “It’ll give us a barometer of where we’re at right now; it’s not going to be easy, it never is.”
  But in reality, this weekend is more 
of a barometer for Miami than for Flor-ida. 
  It’s the Hurricanes who have faced 
little resistance romping their way into the weekend with an undefeated record. Miami has won its eight games by an average of 5.63 runs, while Flor-ida has marched through its seven vic-tories with an average margin of 3.71. 
  The difference is competition. Mi-
ami’s two weekend series wins have come against Rutgers and Albany, both unranked teams. 
  In 2011, the Hurricanes ﬁ  nished the 
season batting .275, good for No. 181 in the nation. So far this season, they are hitting .307 and have eight players batting .308 or better, including senior catcher Peter O’Brien, who is hitting .500 with three homers and 10 RBIs. 
  To contrast Miami’s slate, Florida 
has already faced two top-25 teams in No. 20 Cal State Fullerton and No. 19 UCF, going 3-1 in those contests. Through eight games, Florida’s team batting average is actually slightly be-low where it was last season when the Gators were No. 24 in the nation in the category. 
  “All the teams we’ve played so 
far have been good competition,” UF Friday night starting pitcher Hudson Randall said. “We’re not playing any-body that has a weak, weak team.”
  Miami’s greatest strength coming in 
will be its weekend pitching rotation.  
  Friday night ace Eric Erickson has 
thrown 13 innings in his two starts this season, striking out 16 without allow-ing a run. However, tonight will be his ﬁ  rst real challenge in nearly two years after missing most of 2010 and all of 2011 because of his second reconstruc-tive elbow surgery. 
Eric Whaley and Bryan Radziews-
ki — both solid pitchers in their own 
right — will fol-low on Saturday and Sunday, but it’s safe to say 
neither has seen bats remotely close to those of Preston Tucker and Mike Zu-nino since getting eliminated from last season’s regionals by the Gators. 
  “Nothing’s going to surprise us,” 
Tucker said. “We’ve played Miami a ton of times in the past few years. We know what we’re going to get.”
  Long-term history aside, Florida 
has taken ownership of the rivalry in recent years. The Gators have won the past eight games in the series, includ-ing knocking the Hurricanes out of both the 2011 NCAA Regionals and the 2010 Super Regionals. Florida has won 11 of the last 12 against Miami. 
  “The numbers are in our favor, 
but this is a new year,” Randall said. “I’m looking forward to going down there.” 14, ALLIGATOR   FRIDAY, MARCH 2, 2012

When Florida travels to Lincoln, 
Neb., to face Nebraska on Sunday, the Gators will be 
looking to their freshman star to step up once again. Kytra Hunter, the Southeastern Conference Gymnast of the Week, is taking an ambitious approach to Sunday’s meet. She aims to outdo her all-around score of 39.675 from last weekend.� No. 4 FLORIDA PLAYS No.

Shawn Janetzke / Alligator Staff UF, Miami continue rivalry
UF BaseballIn the remaining 31:14 of 
the game, Florida scored just 46 
points.
With the Gators producing 
more than a third of their 67 total points in the four-guard lineup, Vanderbilt coach Kevin Stallings was understandably flustered at seeing the nation’s leading team in made 3-point-ers add a new wrinkle to its of-fense.
“[They] had four guards [on 
the court], and I said, ‘The heck with that,’” Stallings said. “We had our standard lineup in there, so we put our four-best ball-handlers out there with Festus [Ezeli].”
The guard-heavy rotation 
is even more intriguing for ex-tended use when considering Florida has turned over the ball an average of 14 times per game in its seven losses this season. 
However, using primarily 
four guards against the Com-modores, the Gators went just more than 15 minutes in the second half without a turn-over. 
While playing a lineup 
filled with nothing but 3-point shooters has been a long-fabled dream of many Gators fans, it has been little-used since the preseason due to the unexpect-ed emergence of Yeguete as the team’s best post defender.
Though Donovan has gone 
to the new rotation almost out of necessity after Yeguete suf-fered a broken foot last week, its effectiveness against Van-derbilt showed it can give the Gators a much-needed offen-sive boost as tournament sea-son begins.
The only factor working 
against Florida will be time.
Selection Sunday for the 
NCAA Tournament is next weekend, leaving the Gators a maximum of four more games should they advance to the SEC Tournament Championship to further implement and im-prove their four-guard offense.  
“[The Gators are] trying to 
find their deal right now and that’s not an easy thing to do in a short period of time,” Stall-ings said.
Regardless of how UF closes 
the regular season, Donovan has made sure the 3-point-heavy Gators will still have a shooter’s chance in any single-elimination game going for -
ward.

BOOTHE , from page 13 UF enters as losers of two straight
of just two or three true contenders 
for the Naismith Player of the Year award — for his timing, reactions and quick jumping ability . 
Unlike past dominant SEC big 
men such as Shaquille O’Neal, the 6-foot-10, 220-pound Davis is not a physical intimidator. Still, his ability to extend and block shots is unri-valed in the college game. 
“He’s very , very deceptive in 
how long he can become when he leaves the floor,” Donovan said. “He is as good as I’ve seen shot-blocking in this league in a long, long time.”
Florida enters Sunday’s game off of consecutive losses to Georgia and Vanderbilt, looking to avenge the 78-58 beatdown Kentucky adminis-tered in Lexington on Feb. 7. 
The Gators hit only six of 27 
3-point attempts, compared to a 
9-of-15 effort from the Wild-cats. UK shot 52.7 percent and had four players score in double figures.
“Our defense 
was totally ter -
rible,” freshman Brad Beal said after the game. “There’s a way to defend them, we just didn’t do it.”This time, Florida will have the 
advantage of home court. Kentucky has yet to face a ranked opponent in a true road game this season. 
Following the game, UF will head 
to New Orleans for the SEC Tourna-ment, which runs March 8-11. The Gators have already secured a first-round bye, meaning they will begin play Friday . 
The final will be played at 1 p.m. 
on March 11, just hours before the selection committee reveals the field for the NCAA Tournament.
Where UF lands in that bracket 
depends heavily on what happens between now and then. Contact Greg Luca at gluca@alligator.org.

George records 15th double-double in win
Auburn and UF finished the game tied with 32 points 
in the paint each, but the Gators ultimately bested the Ti-
gers in the frontcourt. While Florida outrebounded Au-burn 48-41, the Gators did most of their damage thanks to a 55.8 offensive rebounding percentage.
Junior forward Jennifer George pulled down six of-
fensive rebounds, which tied for the game high, and recorded her 15th double-double of the season with 12 points and 14 boards.
Azania Stewart helped George fortify the post, scor -
ing 10 points and grabbing six rebounds. George and Stewart posted their numbers while facing constant double-teams from the Tigers.
“Well, we knew they were going to double inside,” 
Jones said. “George has had an amazing season; she draws a lot of attention.”Assistant coach Brenda Mock Kirkpatrick said the 
Gators worked on breaking double-teams during the week, with a focus on passing and creating effective shots.
“Honestly , versus most of our SEC opponents, we do 
have that low-block advantage with Jennifer George and Azania,” Kirkpatrick said. “We’re one of the few (SEC) teams that start two true post players.”
Moving past Auburn, Florida needs a sharp perfor -
mance against Kentucky in order to get off the bubble.
With the eyes of the NCAA Tournament selection 
committee watching, the upset-minded Gators will need to learn from their past mistakes against the Wildcats.
“We’ve got to play really, really hard and with a tre-
mendous amount of fight,” Butler said. “But we also have to play a good, detailed basketball game.”
