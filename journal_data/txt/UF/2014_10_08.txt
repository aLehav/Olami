Actor and activist George Takei speaks at the University Auditorium on 
Tuesday night as part of the Accent Speaker’s Bureau series.
� THE ACTOR-TURNED-ACTIVIST GOT 
SERIOUS ABOUT SOCIAL ISSUES.

Alligator Staff Writerafisher@alligator.org
George Takei stepped onto the University 
Auditorium stage Tuesday evening to thun-
derous applause. 
“This is a really spectacular place — it de-
serves an ‘oh my,’” he said. 
The activist and “Star Trek” actor was 
brought by the Accent Speaker’s Bureau, Pride Student Union and Asian American Student Union to share his message on democracy and the connection between minorities at 8 p.m. 
“Throughout the year, we celebrate the di-
versity in America,” Takei said. “Because cen-tral to the vitality of this nation is the fact that we are diverse, and we celebrate the various 
histories, cultures, experiences that make up 
this great country. And as Americans, we are diverse. Infinite diversities, infinite combina-tions. And the Trekkies recognize that.” 
Takei took the audience back to 1941: the 
bombing of Pearl Harbor. He was 4 years old, and it was the beginning of his politically ac-tive career as a Japanese-American. His family was taken from their home and forced to live 
in a horse stall before being transferred to an 
Arkansas internment camp. His father was la-beled an enemy non-alien, even though he en-listed to fight for America. Takei said he was too young to understand and feel the pain. 
He then became active in campaigns 
such as the civil rights movement, where he marched alongside Martin Luther King Jr. 
But Takei didn’t just feel different because 
of his face, he said. At 10 years old, he knew he was different when he had feelings for boys rather than girls. 
As a budding actor, he said he stayed 
closeted and felt alone. He saw innocent gay men and lesbians get incarcerated due to ig-norance, connecting it to his childhood as a Japanese-American. He has been an LGBT ac-tivist since 2005, when the bill for equal rights was banned in California.
But Takei said there is a reason to celebrate Trekkie Takei talks democracy, LGBT

After five months of searching, UF hopes 
to announce its 12th president Oct. 15. 
The selection process will begin Monday 
and end Wednesday. There are currently 15 
applicants.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said ap-
plications are not closed, but if an applicant wants to be considered, his or her application has to be submitted by Monday. 
“Monday will be the applicant review, and 
the search committee will narrow the list of applicants,” Sikes said. 
She said after reviewing every applica-
tion based on the qualifications found under 
the search criteria, the committee will invite 
between three and five individuals to campus Tuesday for interviews.
Applicants include UF Provost Joseph 
Glover and Kamal Dean Parhizgar, professor of management and business ethics at Texas A&M International University. 
After interviews with the search commit-
tee, select applicants will be referred to the UF 
Board of Trustees for interviews.
Split between Tuesday and Wednesday, 
each finalist will attend an open student com-
munity public forum on campus to meet stu-dents, staff and the greater UF community, Sikes said. There will also be a separate fac-ulty assembly.
“I’m excited there is a lot of interest in this 
position and am looking forward to meet-
ing the candidates next week,” Student Body 
President Cory Yeffet wrote in an email. “I’m hopeful there are distinguished academics who are also great leaders with diverse expe-riences, and we are able to select an incredibly Next UF prez 
may be picked

While Gainesville is used to the hectic 
swarm of students and residents, the City 
of Hawthorne is more acquainted with the sound of nature and the sight of familiar faces.
Downtown Hawthorne is roughly 1 
square mile and houses about 14,000 resi-dents, said Ellen Vause, Hawthorne’s city manager.
Hawthorne enjoys its small town charm, 
but Vause said the city is eager for tourists to view its nature trails and parks, as well as 
Main Street.
In an attempt to revitalize the downtown 
area and spur economic development, the 
city plans to extend its 16-mile bicycle trail. Hawthorne’s previous city planner asked the Florida Department of Transportation for a renovation grant three years ago, and the city recently announced the project is now underway.
“We need the people,” Vause said. “We 
need the visitors.”
The .7-mile project will extend the 
Gainesville-Hawthorne State Trail, one of the top 10 trails in Florida, from just west of U.S. 301 along Southeast 71st Avenue and Southeast 221st Street to the new trail end at State Road 20.
The project will start in summer 2016 and cost about $420,000, said Rebecca White, a spokeswoman for the project. It will take about six to eight months to complete.
The FDOT and the Hawthorne City Com-
mission held an open house informational meeting Tuesday in the Hawthorne City Hall Auditorium to discuss the trail’s exten-sion.
The proposed project will include repav-
ing, widening of road lanes and pavement

On Wednesday, the final 
day of the search, the Board of Trustees will interview the 
finalists and elect the next UF 
president.
Then the president-elect 
will be ratified by the Florida Board of Governors at its next meeting, wrote UF President Search Committee Chairman Steven Scott in an email to the UF community Monday. 
The questions asked at the 
campus and faculty assem-blies will be those developed during the 2012 searches as well as recent public input. 
The schedule is still being 
formalized and will be posted on the search website later this week, Sikes said. 
“There absolutely will be a 
student community public fo-rum on Tuesday evening,” she said. “We will want them to participate. We want students 
to be part of the process. We 
know choosing the next presi-dent affects them as well.”
Sikes said Scott’s email be-
gan with extreme optimism. 
“We are pleased with the 
response nationwide,” she said. “And we are confident that we will have a qualified 
applicant pool to consider on 
Monday.”ARIANA FIGUEROA

Tuesday night’s UF Student Sen-
ate meeting was the last for some 
and the first for many.
In the first half of the Senate’s 
double-header meeting, senators 
said their goodbyes, thanked their 
peers and gave advice.
“Don’t be a Tuesday night sena-
tor,” said Sen. Bradley Bean, who encouraged new senators to leave their mark and get involved in com-mittees in the Senate.
Sen. Michael Christ, the outgoing 
and last Students Party senator, ad-
vised the new generation of senators 
to speak their minds.
“Your time in here is very, very 
short,” he said.  “Remember why you came here.”  
The meeting then moved on to 
approve the 2014 Student Govern-ment election results and address the issue of District E’s Senate seat.  
Senators voted to certify the elec-
tion results presented by UF Super-visor of Elections Hans Rojas. The Elections Commission recommend-ed validation for the vote totals for all seats except District E, Commis-sion Chairman Harold Holder said.No candidate qualified to cam-
paign as a District E senator, yet 11 write-in votes — a majority — were cast for “Swamp Party.” The seat of District E, Holder said, will not be granted to the Swamp Party because it is not a candidate. According to the SG elections codes, a “write-in candidate” is defined as any person who could have met the qualifica-
tions of the office.
Before the first meeting con-
cluded, Christ and Sen. Jason Rich-
ards were nominated for the John Michael Stratton Memorial Award, and Senators Davis Bean, Joseph Mi-chaels and Leah Miller were nomi-nated for the Paul Clark Memorial Award for Outstanding Committee 
Chairperson.
As the old senators filed out of 
the chambers, new senators were 
quickly sworn in by Chief Justice Marshall McDonald, followed by nominations for Senate President and Senate President Pro-Tempore.
Michaels was nominated and 
unanimously voted in as UF Senate 
President, as was Bean for Senate 
President Pro-Tempore.
“I’m very thankful for the Senate 
for entrusting me with leading the Senate body,” Michaels said.  4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2014

The Pride Student Union is asking UF 
students to peer through the looking glass 
to learn more about the LGBT community’s Pride History Week.
With each day coinciding with a decade 
in the LGBT history, the Pride Student Union has planned a series of events to acknowl-edge its past and celebrate National Coming Out Day on Friday. 
“I want this week to expose the extensive national history of the queer community be-yond the mainstream gay rights movement that many are already aware of,” said Dami-
an Gonzalez, internal vice president for Pride 
Student Union.
The week kicked off Monday with a dis-
cussion on being queer and religious, he said. Taking each day decade by decade, the Pride Student Union will use the rest of the week to explore other identities and topics from HIV and AIDS to dressing in drag.
Gonzalez, a 20-year-old journalism and 
political science junior, said the week is about breaking down the stigma associated with HIV, bridging the gap between religious and queer individuals and dismantling the gen-der binary.The group is providing an HIV/AIDS 
workshop led by the the Gainesville Area AIDS Project and Queer People of Color 
United. There will be free HIV testing by 
WellFlorida. The workshop will take place in Little Hall, Room 217 at 8 p.m today. 
The organization is also hosting an event 
called Drag Ball: Rio Carnival on Thursday at 8 p.m. inside the UF Hillel, where guests are encouraged to dress in drag, he said.
“We want to acknowledge the oppressive 
forces, but we also want to recognize how vi-
brant and flamboyant and warm and exciting 
this community and culture can be,” said Col-lin Vernay, Pride Student Union president. 
Beginning at 10 a.m. Friday, Pride Student 
Union and LGBT Affairs will host an inter-active art gallery on Plaza of the Americas, which is devoted to the experience of coming out, the 21-year old psychology and sociol-
ogy senior said.
This year, the coming-out event will show-
case positive remarks UF students, alumni 
and faculty have heard when they came out. 
There will be two walls with pictures of 
students holding a whiteboard. On one side will be the discouraging statements and the other will show positive quotes, said Tessa Arthur, a marketing sophomore and ambas-
sador for LGBT affairs.
“These events are so important to the UF 
community because many scared, closeted 
high schoolers come to UF, hoping for more inclusion and acceptance,” Arthur, 20, said. 
Pride History Week asks students to reflect on LGBT history
pRESiDENT , from 
page 1The selection is a 
three-day processHe spoke about life in internment camp
as federal courts recently struck 
down gay-marriage bans.
“More than 60 percent of the U.S. 
will now have marriage equality,” he said. “However, it’s not about 
percents. And when I pledge alle-
giance to the flag, I pledge allegiance to the United States of America. And I know that within, at most, two years, we will be celebrating, and we will be pledging allegiance to the United States of America — all 
50 states, including Florida. It’s com-
ing, Florida.”        
Students in the audience had a 
positive response to the connection between Asian American history and the LGBT movement. 
“It was wonderful to have the in-
tersection,” said Damian Gonzalez, a 20-year-old UF journalism and po-litical science junior and Pride Stu-dent Union internal vice president. “It’s a dialogue not promoted often 
and is usually separated.”
Takei’s final thoughts shared 
views on the vibrancy of America’s 
history and future, resulting in a standing ovation.   
“Throughout history, it’s the 
changes that made this country more of a democracy,” he said. “Ac-tivists make changes.”TAkEi , from page 1
Trail renovations will cost $420,000
marking.
Two 13-foot bike lanes will be added to Southeast 
71st Avenue, which will be widened by 8 feet.
The bike route enhancements will make use of 
shared lanes that indicate where a cyclist has the right 
to ride. Under Florida law, bicycles have the same 
rights and responsibilities as motor vehicles, said Leigh Ann Bennett, the FDOT’s project manager.
“Bicycle riders, if they chose to, could take the 
whole lane,” she said.These bike lanes will be marked with a “sharrow” 
symbol, which is the designated symbol for shared 
lanes.
Future plans for Hawthorne include extending the 
trail along State Road 20 into Palatka and renovating 
the downtown area with a community center, restau-rants and boutiques.
John Dee, the design project manager, said there 
will be lane closures, but no road closures.
“No detours or anything, as far as I’m concerned,” 
he said.hAwThORNE , from page 1WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Students can take a break from their class-
es Friday and jump into a tech playground 
in front of the Marston Science Library.
Beats by Dre headphones, 3-D printing 
and laptop GPS trackers will be on display 
at the first Student Tech Fair on Friday from 
11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and is hosted by UF Infor-mation Technology and Smathers Libraries.
Jameson Johnston, IT manager for UFIT, 
said about 20 on-campus organizations will participate in the event to showcase the ser-vices available to students. 
“Students aren’t aware of all the different 
types of services available to them, whether it’s the UF Help Desk or the computer labs across campus,” he said. “We want to make sure that students are aware of the technol-ogy offered.” UFIT, along with the UF Book-
store, computer labs and libraries will be in 
attendance.
The idea for the fair came from Chloe 
Finch, a 21-year-old journalism senior and 
employee at UFIT, said Bobby Brito, a politi-
cal science, history and international studies 
senior and member of the Tech Fair plan-
ning committee.  
The fair will highlight Library West’s 
one-week iPad rentals, the Collaboration 
Commons study space in Marston Science 
Library and UFIT’s Adobe Creative Suite 6 
labs.Brito said he is looking forward to seeing 
students embrace UF’s free technology.
“I’m not a STEM major, so it’s nice to see 
what services are offered through the uni-
versity that I can use,” Brito, 21, said.
University Police will introduce the 
FrontDoorSoftware Laptop Loss and Re-
covery program that allows students to re-motely lock and track their laptops in case of theft.
Lynda.com and UFApps, a software ap-
plication that provides students with free 
access to Microsoft software and AutoCAD 
2014, will also be promoting their tech ser-
vices. 
Tracy Gale, UFIT communications man-
ager, wrote in an email that the goal of the 
fair is to bring campus IT services together 
in one place.
Johnston said only a small portion of 
the tech services at UF are not used by stu-
dents.
“We’re looking to get feedback about our 
services and see what else we can offer the students,” he said.UF starts up the first Student Tech Fair: Friday outside Marston
� IT HAS PURCHASED 
20,000 SO FAR.

Through a project known 
as “Cuba: Million Bible Mis-
sion,” The Rock of Gainesville Church is trying to raise more than $5 million to send a million Bibles to Cuba.
The Bibles cost $5.40 each 
and, so far, the Rock has raised more than $100,000 and purchased 20,000 Bibles. 
All of those will be dis-
tributed by the United Bi-ble Society, the Council of Churches and the Rock in November.
The project began in June 
in partnership with the Unit-ed Bible Society. The Rock expects to reach its million-Bible goal by 2017 or 2018, said church spokesman Os-car Candelaria.
According to Candelaria, 
the Rock and the United Bible Society have received permission from the Cuban government to distribute the Bibles in the country.
The Bibles are in “an easy-
to-understand translation,” said Candelaria, who was born in Cuba.
According to the Rock, 
about 77 percent of Cuba’s population is Christian. 
The church said Christi-
anity is growing by about 15 percent each year in Cuba.
While some people, like 
Kevin Cauthen, a 17-year-old dual-enrollment Santa Fe College student, think what the Rock is doing is a good thing, some people, like Jo-nah Stokes, believe differ-
ently.
“Why a million Bibles 
for Cuba?” the 18-year-old 
musical theater freshman at Santa Fe asked, laughing. “Aren’t Cubans already reli-gious? They aren’t a godless nation.”
Sequoia Cervone Buzzel-
la, a UF sustainability fresh-man, said she thinks that the $5 million could go towards other things.
Tabitha Odabe, a senior 
at The Rock School who also attends the church, said she disagreed.
“It’s a good thing,” she 
said, referring to the mis-sion, adding that “there are people who want to know God more and want to read God’s Word,” but they don’t have access to it.
Candelaria said people 
criticizing the effort to bring Bibles, rather than aiding the poor and in-need, just don’t have the right perspective. 
“Most people in the U.S. 
don’t have any idea what it’s like to live in a country where you’re persecuted,” he said. 
“Where everything is il-
legal, where you can’t raise your own food without giv-ing most of it to the govern-ment.”
He continued, “And so, 
it’s easy to criticize this proj-ect of bringing in a million Bibles to Cuba, thinking you could use this money for something else.”Church hopes to 
send million copies of Bible to Cuba
� IT’S THIRD FOR BEST 
RENTAL PROPERTIES.
CARLY JUVE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Whether you’re looking to buy 
a rental property or flip a house, 
Gainesville is one of the best cities in the country to do it. 
The city ranked in the top 10 col-
lege towns for both categories — third for buying rental property and sixth for flipping houses.
The rankings were compiled by 
RealtyTrac, a real estate information company based in California.
“This is our first time doing this 
kind of report,” said Ginny Walker, RealtyTrac spokeswoman. “What we liked about UF is that it appeared 
on both lists.”
Data was also collected from the 
National Center for Education Sta-
tistics, Walker said. The top college-town rankings for buying rental properties were based on annual gross rental yield, she said, while the top college towns for flipping houses were ranked based on the average gross return on investment percentage for the first eight months of 2014.
Terry Martin-Back has been in the 
business of flipping houses for about 30 years. He is the co-owner of the Exit Realty franchise in Gainesville and a general contractor. 
“I enjoy going into houses that 
nobody else wants and then turning them into something that someone can enjoy again,” Martin-Back said.  
The main reason for flipping 
houses is money, he said. 
“Students are buying older con-
dos and apartments because they are affordable,” Martin-Back said. “Right now we have about 2,500 new apartments and condos com-ing in.”
Holly Linville, a 21-year-old UF 
communication sciences and disor-ders senior, has lived in a more af-fordable house behind Midtown for two years with two roommates.“The location of my house is

responded well to the Treon Harris ac-cusations?Today’s question: Are you going to the UF Student Tech 
Fair?Scott, Crist: not leadership Fla. needs
As you venture around Gainesville, political signs are a 
ubiquitous sight on street corners. However, as far as the eye can see, there’s hardly a sign in sight for either 
Gov. Rick Scott or democratic candidate Charlie Crist. Per-haps the campaigns are simply eschewing campaign signs 
for other means of advertisement, or perhaps it’s a sign that 
voters are just not that excited for the gubernatorial election. With less than a month until Election Day, campaign fever should be sweeping Florida. But if it’s happening elsewhere in the state, it’s certainly not happening in Gainesville.
Crist recently visited Gainesville to open a campaign of-
ﬁ  ce, but few politicos seemed to care, despite the candidate himself showing up to christen the ofﬁ  ce.
If there’s one campaign tactic seen by Floridians every-
where, it’s the attack ads eating away at our hearts and souls. Charlie Crist loves President Barack Obama, Rick Scott steals money like Dr. Evil, and both candidates are going to eat your children. Perhaps the last ad isn’t real, but at this point, would you put it past either candidate to make such a hor-riﬁ  c claim?
Generally, I consider campaign signs to be nothing more 
than litter that decorates our yards, street corners and aban-doned businesses during campaign season, but seeing an 
entire town nearly bereft of Crist or Scott signs during such a 
close election is quite surprising.
It’s true that Gainesville is not exactly the main battle-
ground for control of the governor’s mansion, but you have to wonder if voters in South Florida and along the Interstate 4 corridor feel the same way. They have a choice between “Lord Voldemort” or “Two-Face,” and neither option seems particularly appealing.
Rolling Stone picked up on the current state of the gu-
bernatorial campaign last week, publishing an article entitled “The Florida Farce,” that chronicles why voters should not support either candidate. Nothing in the article was particu-larly revelatory as they lambasted Scott for his actions while he was CEO of Columbia/HCA and exposed Crist for the ﬂ  ip-ﬂ  opping, political opportunist that he is. 
While we’re abundantly aware of the candidates’ down-
falls, now is the time for us to look in the mirror and ask our-selves if this is the best we can do. Democrats are so desperate for the keys to the governor’s mansion that they welcomed Crist into the party with open arms giving him 
more than 74 percent of the demo-
cratic primary vote. For a man who once wanted to bring back prison chain gangs — earning him the nickname Chain Gang Char-
lie — it was a stunning turnaround. Crist was a Republican just four short years ago, but Democrats don’t care; they just want to win. 
Republicans seem ﬁ  ne with Scott, who famously used his 
Fifth Amendment right not to self-incriminate a whopping 75 times. His company was ﬁ  ned an extraordinary $1.7 billion for Medicare fraud, but again, Republicans seem to have no qualms giving this man another four years in Tallahassee.
Are we truly scraping the barrel so deeply for good politi-
cians in both parties that Democrats and Republicans must settle for political opportunists like Crist or fraudsters who look like Lurch from the Addams Family? 
As discussed in the Rolling Stone piece, Florida has im-
mense problems to tackle, from climate change — if you haven’t noticed, Miami’s starting to drown — to the future of health care in a state where nearly 19 percent of the popula-tion is over the age of 65.
Scott seems only able to toe the Tea Party line, while Crist 
will say just about anything to get elected and then may not do anything once in ofﬁ  ce. The prospect of either man spend-ing the next four years running Florida should terrify us all into ﬁ  nding real leadership between now and 2018.
We have to deal with the effects of climate change now, 
advance the state’s aging infrastructure that can no longer handle the swelling population and ﬁ  nally bring an end to the corruption that envelops Tallahassee like fog on a humid morning. Can this be done with Scott and Crist?
Only time will tell, but don’t hold your breath.Joel Mendelson is a UF grad student in political campaigning. 
His columns appear on Wednesdays.Those following the media’s coverage of the upcoming No-vember election might be forgiven for believing that Flori-da will only have one proposed constitutional amendment 
on the ballot this year. The media have featured wall-to-wall coverage of Amendment 2, which would legalize the use of 
marijuana for medical purposes in the state of Florida.
It’s not surprising that the media have chosen to focus so 
heavily on Amendment 2. Medical marijuana is a controversial 
issue — one that has been debated extensively and ﬁ  ercely at both the state and federal level.
However, there are two other amendments that Florida’s 
voters will decide on this year that are arguably more important than the medical marijuana issue.
Amendment 1, the Water and Land Conservation Amend-
ment, is a proposal that would dedicate a permanent source of revenue to the Land Acquisition Trust Fund, a public trust that purchases Florida land for parks and other conservation efforts. The funding would come from the documentary stamp tax, a tax primarily assessed on real estate transactions.
Gov. Rick Scott and the Florida Legislature have decimated 
spending on environmental conservation in recent years. The fact that Scott has responded to questions about climate change by saying that he is “not a scientist” demonstrates that he does 
not take environmental issues seriously.
The passage of Amendment 1 would ensure a permanent 
source of funding for environmental conservation that would 
not be subject to politically expedient budget cuts.
Amendment 3 relates to the process by which seats on the 
Florida Supreme Court and the state district appeals courts are ﬁ  lled. Passage of the amendment would allow an outgoing gov-ernor to ﬁ  ll any judicial vacancies that are created on the ﬁ  rst day of a newly sworn-in governor’s term.
If Amendment 3 passes, it could allow lame-duck governors 
to ﬁ  ll the courts with appointees of their choosing just before a new governor is set to take ofﬁ  ce.
This particular amendment may seem somewhat arcane and 
insubstantial, but it could have signiﬁ  cant consequences for the future makeup of the Florida Supreme Court and other lower courts.
Amendments 1 and 3 might not be as sexy and topical as 
Amendment 2, but they are both just as important to Florida’s 
future, if not more so.

The outcome of the votes on Amendments 1 and 3 will have

selves about these important issues and make an informed choice.Other proposed

What do women want? It’s a question both 
women and men have been asking them-selves for years. To some, the answer might 
be equal pay in comparison to male counterparts; to others, it might be control over reproductive health.  However, this week, “Jeopardy!,” the popular Q-and-A style game show whose run has spanned 50 
years, took it upon itself to ﬁ  nally answer the ques-
tion that has been left unanswered for years. 
This past Monday, “Jeopardy!” included a cat-
egory called “What Women Want” in its ﬁ  rst round. The name of the category seemed innocent enough 
— until the clues were read aloud. While the vague-
ly named category could have taken many forms, it caused nothing but controversy. Instead of taking a progressive look at women, the category deferred to 
female stereotypes, as if the year were still 1950. 
With answers like “Some help around the house; 
would it kill you to get out the Bissell bagless canis-
ter one of these every once in a while?” or “A pair of jeans that ﬁ  t well, like the 525s from this brand,” 
female viewers were absolutely offended. Sure, some 
women may want a new vacuum or time to relax and do a crossword, but to say that these are the only things women want is absurd. 
These answers put forth the idea that women are 
too simplistic and naïve to want anything more than a pair of jeans, and even if they do want things like equality, it doesn’t matter because vacuums are for women, and equality is for men. 
“Jeopardy!” not only generalized all women 
but  also implied that the only thing women want (or should want) is to have a pleasant, domestic life and, of course, a nice pair of jeans. Never mind that 
66 million women in the U.S. have full- or part-time 
jobs, or the fact that women make up 47 percent of the workforce.
Women who viewed this episode of “Jeopardy!” 
quickly took to Twitter and started the hashtag 
#whatwomenwant to show that, despite what people 
may think, women want more than just vacuums. Women all over the U.S. called out the game show writers and let them know that they weren’t inter-
ested in just having time to relax and do some cross-
word puzzles. 
Bringing up issues like putting an end to rape cul-
ture, receiving equal pay and recognition of female efforts inside and outside the home, women were not 
shy about showing how disappointed they were with 
the category.
One Twitter user even created her own parody 
question to show just how ridiculous the category 
was: “A clean house, a satisﬁ  ed husband, and lots of 
shoes! What are outdated stereotypes?” Even actress Sophia Bush commented on the show, saying “Jeop-ardy, for a smart show you just got srsly stupid.” As of Sunday, “Jeopardy!” has yet to respond to any of 
these comments.
While it may be difﬁ  cult for the staff at “Jeopar-
dy!” to believe, women want more than time to do pi-
lates or drink Sleepytime tea. The needs and desires 
of women are not the same as they were 60 years ago 
and have evolved to include more than just domestic matters. 
“Jeopardy!” missed the opportunity to make so-
cial commentary and bring attention to the real needs 
of women, but instead, chose to defer to stereotypes. 
By conﬁ  ning women to these sorts of stereotypes, we are backtracking on all the progress feminist move-ments and women everywhere have made in the past 
several decades.

Election Day is quickly approaching. On Nov. 4, Flor-
ida voters will decide whether to enact Amendment 2: The Florida Right to Medical Marijuana Initiative. 
The initiative’s passage allows for the medical use of 
marijuana, administration of marijuana by caregivers, 
recommendations by licensed physicians and the sale of 
marijuana by medical marijuana treatment centers.  
As discussed in last week’s column, Amendment 2 is 
deeply ﬂ  awed. To restate my stance, I support the legal-ization of medical marijuana but disapprove of Amend-ment 2. This opinion is supported by the effects of medi-cal marijuana legalization in California and by analyses of Amendment 2’s ﬁ  ne print.
The way to determine the potential effects of Amend-
ment 2 is not to simply hope its passage will turn out well. Instead, let’s examine the effects of similar laws in other states.
California passed a medical marijuana amendment 
similar to Amendment 2 in 1996. Greg Warmoth, a re-porter for Orlando’s Channel 9, investigated its effect on California in November 2013. 
Warmoth easily secured a physician’s certiﬁ  cation for 
medical marijuana after telling the doctor, a gynecologist 
who opened a “pot doc” shop on the side for extra money, 
that he had trouble sleeping.
Because the ﬁ  ne print of Florida’s bill includes “other 
conditions” outside of debilitating diseases as valid quali-ﬁ  ers for medical marijuana certiﬁ  cation, people can get medical marijuana for even small ailments like “trouble sleeping.”
Because California’s and Florida’s amendments are so 
similar, possession in Florida will be an easy process, and 
the amendment’s medical purposes may be abused for 
recreational uses. 
Furthermore, Amendment 2 gives the Florida Depart-
ment of Health a large role in creating regulations related to medical marijuana. While it is reasonable to assume FDOH will supply ample regulation to close any loop-holes allowing for misuse in the amendment’s text, the amendment does not commission FDOH to create regula-tions to its needed extent. 
Within Amendment 2’s full text, FDOH is responsible 
for issuing identiﬁ  cation cards to patients and caregivers, creating standards of renewal for ID cards, creating health and safety standards for medical marijuana treatment cen-ters and creating a regulation for how much marijuana can be purchased. 
FDOH is left with no responsibility to create standards 
for where one can smoke medical marijuana or where one can open a medical marijuana treatment center.Since there are no stipulations 
for the location of such treatment centers, a “pot doc” can open up shop next to a school or in a residential community. This, 
coupled with no regulation for 
where medical marijuana can be smoked, will create numerous problems. 
Comparing marijuana to 
products like alcohol and ciga-rettes is not a valid comparison 
because alcohol and cigarettes have regulations on where they can be sold and where one could drink or smoke. 
Medical marijuana would have neither of those regula-
tions under Amendment 2.
The issue of medical marijuana is personal for me. My 
mom has had chronic, progressive multiple sclerosis for more than 20 years. It is impossible for anyone who has not experienced it ﬁ  rsthand to conceive of the pain this disease causes. The effects of multiple sclerosis can be completely debilitating.
I have seen my mother go from walking upright to us-
ing a walker to relying on a wheelchair. I have seen her body cripple and wither under the effects of this disease.
I know the side effects of the countless medications she 
has used for treatment: sleepiness, fogginess, and in other cases, digestive and liver problems.
By any deﬁ  nition, multiple sclerosis qualiﬁ  es as a debil-
itating disease. If Amendment 2 passes, my mom would be eligible to use medical marijuana for relief. 
As unusual as it is for me to consider my mother light-
ing up a blunt and taking a puff, if that’s going to give her relief, I want her to get it.
However, I can’t support the legalization of medical 
marijuana just yet. Amendment 2 is simply too vague.
If the amendment passes, legislation following it will 
be reactive instead of preventative. State lawmakers are going to be kicking themselves to push out new laws that will curve the unintended consequences of Amendment 2, like the ability for people to open a medical marijuana 
treatment center anywhere and the ability to smoke mari-
juana anywhere.
Medical marijuana should be legal, and voters should 
be able to compassionately allow the choice for relief through medical marijuana. However, that choice should not come until a more revised and more restrictive form of Amendment 2 is proposed.

The Florida Gym will cel-
ebrate its 65th anniversary on 
Oct. 21 with a luncheon for staff, faculty and students.
“I was looking through some 
old papers and realized that this year would be the 65th anniver-sary,” said Christine Coombes, director of communications for the College of Health and Hu-man Performance, “so I talked to the dean, and he thought it would be a good idea to cel-ebrate.”
In addition to the luncheon, 
the college will host a birthday party-themed tailgate before the Florida versus Missouri game Oct. 18. Florida Gym courtyard bricks will also be on sale for a discounted price of $65 in honor of the 65-year mark. 
The tailgate will include a 
display of black and white pho-tographs of the gym from the 
‘50s around the courtyard. The 
dean of the college, Michael Reid, will also be saying a few words in honor of the anniver-sary, Coombes said.
The Florida Gym was built in 1949 and has held several events since, including  performances by Johnny Cash and speeches by John F. Kennedy, Hubert Hum-phrey and Lyndon B. Johnson, said Carl Van Ness, an archivist 
at UF’s Smathers Library.
The Florida Gym houses the 
College of Health and Human 
Performance, where 52 faculty members teach more than 1,900 students, according to the col-lege press release. 
“A lot of the things we do 
in the O’Dome today, we used 
to do at the Florida Gym back 
then,” Van Ness said.
Students can join the celebra-
tion by attending the tailgate at the Florida Gym courtyard at 5:30 p.m. Oct. 18.

Burglar caught in the act offers to 
share heroin 
BILLINGS, Mont. — Prosecutors in 
Montana said a man caught leaving a 
house he had apparently burglarized apol-ogized to the homeowner and offered him some heroin.
The Billings Gazette reported that  Christopher Dayell Bittner made an initial court appearance Monday on felony bur-glary and drug possession charges.
Authorities said the homeowner and his 
7-year-old son came home as Bittner was leaving Saturday. Yellowstone County At-torney Paul Adam said Bittner apologized and offered the drug. He was found near-
by, and court records said a search of his 
backpack turned up 31.5 grams of heroin, drug paraphernalia and items belonging to the homeowner.
Public defender Roberta Drew asked 
that Bittner be released without bail be-cause he wanted to attend his father’s fu-neral. Bail was set at $7,500, but Bittner was allowed to attend the service.

Hunt on for 1.5-ton gargoyles missing 
from church 
WORCESTER, Mass. — Church officials 
and preservationists are trying to figure out what happened to several 1.5-ton gar-
goyles from a Massachusetts church.
The church in Worcester is a one-fifth 
scale replica of Notre Dame Cathedral in 
Paris built in the 1980s. It now is owned by 
an Assembly of God congregation and is 
on the market for $2.5 million.
The group’s director told The Telegram 
& Gazette the 3,000-pound gargoyles were removed for safety reasons by a construc-
tion company that went out of business. 
The company’s assets were sold at auction, and they fear the gargoyles were sold.News briefs: Man accused of burglary offers heroin as apologyUF scholars to host discussion on Ebola virus in Pugh Hall today

UF scholars will come together at Pugh 
Hall to address Ebola virus concerns to-
day. 
The panel discussion on the virus will 
be held from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. in the Ocora 
Room.
The event, “The West African Ebola Epi-
demic: A UF Faculty Discussion & Research 
Poster Session,” will feature a panel of UF faculty who will discuss the disease and its sociocultural effects.UF professor Leonardo A. Villalón, dean 
of the International Center, will moderate the panel. 
“The point is to sort of tap into our ex-
pertise here at UF about an issue that is a very key and current concern,” Villalón said. 
The panel will include Dr. Paul Psychas 
from the UF Community Health and Fam-ily Medicine and Emerging Pathogens In-stitute and Sharon Abramowitz, assistant professor in the Department of Anthropol-ogy and the Center for African Studies. 
Abramowitz said the crisis is not as det-
rimental as the media have led people to believe.“We have a very robust health system 
and strong containment measures whenev-er they are activated,” Abramowitz said. “It would appear that the public health system is working very actively to prepare itself.”
The panel aims to address growing 
health concerns among Americans and within the campus community.The event will be followed by a research 
poster session presented by undergradu-ate students in the UF Ebola virus research group.
Sponsors for the event include the Health 
in Africa Working Group at UF’s Center for African Studies, the UF International Cen-
ter Global Health Council and the Bob Gra-
ham Center for Public Service.
“I think the best strategy is to throw as 
many American resources as possible into containing it at the site where it’s most prevalent right now, and if we address the problem at its source, we won’t have to worry about issues of a broader pandemic,” Abramowitz said. 
“We have a very robust health 
system and strong containment 
measures whenever they are 
activated.”

Students and alumni attending the UF Institute

The 18th annual TailGATOR event hosted in 
partnership with the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences will also feature a student in a cock-roach costume, baby alligators and take-home space plants.
Curtis Smyder, the academic student services 
coordinator in the horticultural sciences depart-
ment, said the event will have an interesting mix 
of attendees. 
“It’s a chance for the college to thank alumni, to show them what we’ve done in the past year and the changes we’re making and how we’re making an impact both in Florida and students’ lives,” he said.
Cathy Carr, director of alum-
ni and career services of the Col-lege of Agricultural and Life Sci-ences, said 600 to 700 people are 
expected to attend the tailgate. 
Face painting, a barbecue and 
a silent auction, which raised about $3,300 for scholarships last year, are highlights of the annual event. 
About 35 interactive displays from IFAS-related 
organizations will educate and entertain attendees, she said.
“It’s a great opportunity for students to interact 
with alumni and professionals who may be in their career area of interest,” Carr said.

BEER FEST WILL GO TO THE BOYS & GIRLS CLUB OF ALA-CHUA COUNTY.
MEGAN STENNES
Alligator Contributing Writer
In a small building toward the 
back of Magnolia Parke, a new 
restaurant has something brew-
ing.
On Oct. 25, One Love 
Cafe is bringing Beer Fest to 
Gainesville.
The cozy restaurant has been 
in operation for about a month and sits on a three-acre park. 
Tickets will be $25 in advance 
for the event and $35 at the door, 
with a portion of the proceeds 
going to the Boys & Girls Club of Alachua County.
Guests will be provided a 
wristband, enabling them to sample about 40 to 80 types of beer and a handful of food items. The cafe will also be open, said 
Juli Denney, one of the co-own-
ers of the cafe. Guests can choose to sit inside or take advantage of outdoor seating.
Just outside of the restaurant 
is a large projector screen, where guests can watch NFL football games on Thursdays, and guests can watch college games on Fri-
days and Saturdays.
“I wanted them to have some-
thing like a beer fest because 
they have the space for it,” said 
Joshua Lane, a regular at One 
Love Cafe.  
All of the cafe’s food is made 
in-house, Denney said, including the fresh ground-beef hamburg-
ers and the sauces and dressings 
she prepares personally.
“I think that sets us apart be-
cause we make almost everything 
from scratch,” Denney said. 
Vegan and vegetarian dishes 
are also available.
Despite the name of the cafe, 
Denney said it does not serve Ja-maican food or have any ties with 
the late Bob Marley. Instead, the name reads like the engraving on the inside of her and her hus-
band’s wedding rings — “One 
Love.”
Currently, the cafe is only 
open three days a week, Thurs-day through Saturday, but Den-
ney said she plans to increase 
its hours once the restaurant has better stability.

healthy and fresh,” Denney said. “Nothing is processed. It’s Amer-ican comfort food with a unique twist, and it still tastes good.”New One Love Cafe to bring wide

After winning two road matches this weekend, the Florida volleyball team remained at No. 9 in the AVCA poll, which was released on Monday.Florida soccer cracks top 5
The UF soccer team moved up one spot to No. 5 in the NSCAA poll, released on Tuesday. Florida swept its two road matches this weekend, defeating Texas A&M 1-0 on Friday and Arkansas 3-1 on Sunday.MELISSA MIHM and JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Staff Writers
The same day news broke about the 
Treon Harris sexual assault allegations, 
two UF football players – quarterback Skyler Mornhinweg and defensive line-man Gerald Willis – got into a ﬁ  ght over 
a pair of cleats.
University Police ofﬁ  cers responded 
to Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium shortly after 
7 p.m. Monday after being notiﬁ  ed of a ﬁ  ght in progress. 
However, the ﬁ  ght had already been 
broken up before law enforcement ar-rived. 
Upon arrival, the responding ofﬁ  cer 
spoke with defensive backs coach Tra-varis Robinson who advised the ofﬁ  cer the team would deal with the issue in-ternally, a report said. 
When ofﬁ  cers made contact with 
Mornhinweg in one of the stadium training rooms, they noticed small lac-erations on Mornhinweg’s lower lip, according to the report. Mornhinweg 
advised the ofﬁ  cers he was injured in 
the ﬁ  ght with Willis. 
Mornhinweg told ofﬁ  cers the ﬁ  ght 
escalated when he approached Willis about a pair of missing football cleats. Mornhinweg told Willis he found his missing pair of cleats in Willis’ locker, 
but Willis told Mornhinweg he grabbed 
the cleats in a rush to get to practice, ac-cording to the report.
Willis was unavailable for comment 
Monday, but contact was made with him Tuesday and he also conﬁ  rmed that the ﬁ  ght started over the missing pair of cleats. Willis told ofﬁ  cers he was eating dinner outside of the stadium 
before Mornhinweg approached him. 
The two exchanged words before Wil-lis pushed Mornhinweg. 
He said Mornhinweg then struck 
him on the chin before he punched Mornhinweg in the face. A small cut was visible on Willis’ chin, police said. 
Mornhinweg was taken to UF Health 
Shands Emergency Room for the cuts 
on his lip. Willis did not need medical 
attention, according to the report.
Neither party wished to press charg-
es. They were both referred to Student Conduct and Conﬂ  ict Resolution. 
“Based upon the complaint with-
drawals, there will be no criminal charges on either individual,” said UPD spokesman Major Brad Barber.
Mornhinweg started Florida’s ﬁ  -
nal three games last season following season-ending injuries to starter Jeff Driskel and then second-stringer Tyler Murphy, who transferred to Boston College after the season ended.
The Philadelphia native threw for 
344 yards, three touchdowns and one interception on a 69.8-percent comple-tion rate in those three games — losses to South Carolina, Georgia Southern and Florida State.
With backup quarterback Treon 
Harris suspended indeﬁ  nitely due to 
an accused sexual assault early Sunday 
morning on UF’s campus, Mornhin-weg is expected to be Driskel’s backup when UF (3-1, 2-1 Southeastern Confer-ence) faces LSU (4-2, 0-2 SEC) on Sat-urday at 7:30 p.m. in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. Will Grier (back spasms) — a true freshman and ﬁ  ve-star recruit — was cleared to practice this week but 
has sat out the past two weeks.
Willis, a ﬁ  ve-star recruit out of New 
Orleans, has seen limited action so far 
in his true freshman season but showed off his athleticism during training camp.
The 6-foot-2, 255-pound defensive 
lineman has played in two games in his freshman season (Eastern Michigan 
and Tennessee), recording four total 
tackles, a half tackle for loss and one quarterback hurry.
Florida football coach Will Mus-
champ is scheduled to speak with me-dia for the ﬁ  rst time since Harris’ sus-pension today. He will be live on the SEC teleconference at 11:20 a.m. and then will speak with local reporters at 
11:30 a.m.

Even in the midst of backup quarterback Treon Har-
ris being accused of sexual assault against a UF student 
on Sunday morning, as well as reserve quarterback Skyler 
Mornhinweg and defensive lineman Gerald Willis ﬁ  ght-
ing over a pair of cleats on Monday, Florida still has a football game against LSU to worry about this week. Here are ﬁ  ve points the Gators need to focus on heading into 
their game against the Tigers on Saturday night at Ben 
Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
1.) Florida needs to run 
the ball — and run it a lot:The Tigers are ranked dead 
last in the Southeastern Con-
ference in run defense, giv-ing up an average of 184.3 yards on the ground per 
game. LSU has surrendered 
600 rushing yards in its two SEC games — losses to Mis-sissippi State and Auburn. 
While Florida fans want to see the excitement in 
the offense that comes with the passing game, this is the opportunity for running back Matt Jones — who already has two games with at least 100 rush-ing yards — to have another breakout performance 
and for sophomore Kelvin Taylor to come out of his 
early-season slump.
2.) The Gators have to stop the Tigers’ run game: 
LSU is arguably as deep at running back as any team in the SEC. The Tigers have utilized a four-headed 
monster in the backﬁ  eld with Leonard Fournette, 
Kenny Hilliard, Darrel Williams and Terrence Ma-gee. All four have at least 37 rushing attempts and 167 yards this season and have accounted for 13 of 
LSU’s 27 touchdowns on offense.
But in LSU’s three games against teams with top-
25 run defenses this year (Wisconsin, 22nd; Missis-
sippi State, 11th; Auburn, 13th), the Tigers have been limited to just 142.7 yards per game.
The Gators come into the game with the 15th best 
run defense in the country, giving up just 103 rush-ing yards per game.
Outside of its 42-21 loss to Alabama, during which 
the Crimson Tide tallied 223 yards rushing alone, Florida’s opponents have been held to no more than 81 yards on the ground each game.
3.) Dural has to be contained: Travin Dural has 
excelled early on in his third year with LSU. After Five points:

After not being able to compete 
in the opening tournament of the 
season, sophomore Maria Torres is ready to begin her second year for the women’s golf team as it 
prepares for the Tar Heel Invita-
tional in Chapel Hill, N.C.
Torres is coming off a fresh-
man campaign in which she was named to the 2014 Southeastern Conference All-Freshman team. 
She was also named the SEC 
Freshman of the Week following her performance at the Allstate 
Sugar Bowl in New Orleans. 
She combined for five top-25 
finishes and two top-10 finishes, which were both second on the 
team.
Even though Torres collected 
several accolades in her first sea-son, she worked over the sum-mer to improve all aspects of her game.
“I was working with my swing 
coach and working with all of my 
team back home, working on ev-ery aspect, so I can get better and 
my mental aspect and trying to be physically ready for everything,” Torres said.
The Puerto Rico native com-
peted at the World Amateur Team Championships held in Karuiza-wa, Japan. 
Torres, along with junior Ursa 
Orehek and sophomore Karolina Vlckova, were three players from the team who competed in Japan.
Torres was the best player 
among the group, finishing at 3-over-par in the tournament. The experience of competing with players from around the world is something Torres was excited about.
“It’s amazing, you represent-
ing your country is a great thing, it’s a good feeling,” Torres said. 
“All the best players in the world 
are competing and it makes you feel good, in a sense that you’re part of that tournament.”
Not being able to compete at 
the Cougar Classic was hard for Torres as she wasn’t able to lend a helping hand for the team, but she’s looking forward to help-
ing out the team as they head to 
UNC.

Florida freshman Lauren Brasure hasn’t 
wasted any time bursting onto the 2014 
cross country scene. 
After finishing as one of the top two 
Florida runners in her first two appear-ances, Brasure continued to make a signifi-
cant impact for the Gators this weekend at 
the Paul Short Run at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pa. 
Lauren landed the top freshman spot at 
the meet alongside a 16th place finish after running an all-time Florida freshman best 20:26.5 6k. Brasure’s 6k time also puts her ninth in 
school history. 
As a team, the Gators 
finished eighth at the meet, the highest placing of the four Southeastern Conference schools that 
competed in the race on Saturday.
For the second time in three weeks Bra-
sure was announced as the SEC Women’s Freshman Runner of the Week after post-ing the SEC’s second-fastest 6K time this season. 
She is the first Gator freshman to earn 
the honor since Julie Macedo in 2012. 
Brasure is no stranger to prestigious 
accolades as she was named the state of Michigan’s “Ms. Cross Country” in her se-nior season back in 2013. 
Brasure and the rest of the women’s 
team will be back in action on Oct. 17 at the Wisconsin adidas Invitational.Brasure named SEC Women’s Freshman Runner of the Week

Secondary needs to contain Travin 
Dural, third down will be major factor
recording 7 catches for 145 yards and two touchdowns 
in 2013, the redshirt sophomore wide receiver leads the Tigers with 574 receiving yards, which is second only to 
Alabama’s Amari Cooper in the SEC. Florida’s second-
ary, which limited Tennessee to just 205 yards through the air on Saturday, will need to do more of the same against LSU.
The combination of Vernon Hargreaves III and Jalen 
Tabor on the outside need to contain the vertical game like they did against the Volunteers, and the Gators need to improve in slot coverage.
4.) Third downs will be crucial: One game after con-
verting just two third downs in Tuscaloosa, Ala., Florida improved on its third-down offense against Tennessee on Saturday, converting 35-percent of its attempts. 
UF will need to continue moving the chains on third 
down and maintain drives against the Tigers.
In Florida’s ﬁ  rst two games of the season — a 65-0 win 
against Eastern Michigan and a 36-30, triple-overtime win against Kentucky to open SEC play — the Gators 
sustained 12 drives of at least 50 yards. In the two games 
since, Florida’s longest drive went for 49 yards, a drive against Tennessee that set up Austin Hardin’s game-win-ning ﬁ  eld goal.
LSU is seventh in the SEC in opponent’s third-down 
conversion (30.2 percent), so if Florida wants a chance to revitalize its up-tempo offense that seems to have been lost as of late, now would be the time to see how it fares.
That success will rely, in part, on the Gators’ receivers 
improving against the Tigers.
Between overthrown passes by Driskel and dropped 
balls by the receivers themselves, the connection needs to start happening.
Quinton Dunbar has just ﬁ  ve receptions in the past 
three games after hauling in ﬁ  ve catches against Eastern Michigan alone. Demarcus Robinson — who had a pro-gram-high-tying 15 catches against Kentucky — has only four total receptions against Alabama and Tennessee.
Those low totals can’t continue if Florida wants suc-
cess.
5.) The pass rush needs to keep its momentum from 
the Tennessee game going: UF found life on its defensive 
line against Tennessee.
Heading into Knoxville, Tenn., Florida’s defense had 
just six sacks through its ﬁ  rst three games of the season.
But after facing the Volunteers, the Gators’ sack total 
doubled.  Redshirt sophomore Bryan Cox Jr. set the pace for the defensive line, tallying a career-high three sacks 
and ﬁ  ve solo tackles.
Florida put constant pressure on UT quarterback Jus-
tin Worley, and the six sacks tied for the most UF had in 
a single game since Will Muschamp took the program’s helm in 2011.

Last weekend ﬁ  ve of the AP Top-
10 teams fell, including Oregon, Ala-
bama, Oklahoma, UCLA and Texas A&M. 
Saturday also gave one of the 
greatest day in sports history in the state of Mississippi with No. 11 Ole Miss defeating No. 3 Alabama and No. 12 Mississippi State’s 48-31 rout of No. 6 Texas A&M. But fear not college football fans, week seven has games you won’t want to miss. 
Texas vs No. 11 Oklahoma, 
Noon, ABC
The Red River Rivalry has lost 
a little bit of its luster thanks to the Longhorns’ struggling to catch a break this season, but keep in mind an unranked Texas surprised every-one last season and beat the then-No. 11 Sooners handily 36-20. 
OU is coming off a tough road 
loss to TCU, which could make the Longhorns fall victim to a rebound beat down.
No. 13 Georgia @ No. 23 Mis-
souri, Noon, CBS
Although all the talk in the 
Southeastern Conference is about 
the Western division, this week’s 
matchup could be pivotal to the SEC 
East race. 
Missouri leads the East stand-
ings, but running back Todd Gur-ley comes to town with more than 700 yards rushing and eight touch-downs, as well as the best chances to win the Heisman Trophy with his odds at 8/5.
No. 2 Auburn @ No. 3 Missis-sippi State, 3:30pm, CBS
This matchup features one of the 
best quarterback battles we’ll see all season with Auburn’s Nick Mar-
shall and Mississippi State’s Dak 
Prescott. 
Both are dual threat guys, but 
Prescott has the edge in the air with 
over 1,200 yards passing and 13 
touchdowns on the season. Missis-
sippi State’s defense was impressive 
against Heisman hopeful Kenny Hill by sacking him four times. Both these western teams are undefeated, 
but Mississippi State could get the 
edge by having back-to-back home 
games. Not to mention ESPN’s Col-lege GameDay will be in Starkville, Miss., for the ﬁ  rst time in the show’s 
history.
No. 9 TCU @ No. 5 Baylor, 
3:30pm, ABC/ESPN2
This one’s a huge Big 12 matchup 
that additionally has major college football playoff implications. TCU is 
coming off of an upset victory over 
Oklahoma but travels to Waco, Tex-as, to take on Baylor which boasts the country’s second ranked total 
offense. Whichever team wins this 
matchup could very likely end up 
winning the conference, and if the 
winner runs the table they could 
ﬁ  nd themselves with a playoff bid 
come December. 
No. 12 Oregon @ No. 18 UCLA, 
3:30pm, FOX
This game would have been the 
marquee matchup of the weekend. 
That was before both Oregon and UCLA lost to unranked teams last week. It’s a cross-divisional PAC-
12 game, but will affect who makes 
it to the title game if we have a tie-breaker situation in either divisions. 
Whichever team’s quarterback has the better day between Oregon’s Marcus Mariota or UCLA’s Brett 
Hundley should get the edge on 
Saturday. 
No. 7 Alabama @ Arkansas, 
6pm, ESPN
The Crimson Tide are usually 
a force to be reckoned with after a loss, but if they dwell too much on 
the loss against Ole Miss, Arkansas could catch them by surprise. If Bret Bielema could pull off the upset and get his ﬁ  rst SEC win against the Tide, it would without a doubt be 
his biggest win of his career. 
No. 3 Ole Miss @ No. 14 Texas 
A&M, 9pm, ESPN
Hugh Freeze is coming off of the 
biggest win of his career after upset-ting Alabama, but the Rebels have a 
big test on Saturday night in College 
Station, Texas. Ole Miss quarterback Bo Wallace put together the game-winning drive to put the Rebels on top of Bama late in the fourth quar-ter, but he gets to meet explosive 
Aggie linebacker Myles Garrett, 
who already has six solo sacks, a 
number good for sixth in the coun-try. The Rebel defense isn’t without playmakers either—the secondary 
has ten interceptions and ranks sec-
ond in the country in pass efﬁ  ciency 
defense.

Following the Florida men 
and women swimming and div-
ing teams’ ﬁ  fth consecutive win in the Pinch A Penny Invitational this weekend, coach Gregg Troy has a better grasp on the talent he possesses in both of his teams as both the men and the women pre-pare for their dual meet against LSU on Saturday.
“Great weekend to have an 
opportunity to swim a champi-onship format very early in the year,” Troy said. “I think it gives everyone a little idea of what you are going to see at the end of the year even though it’s not until February or March, so good ex-perience there. 
“The women’s meet was a 
little more competitive than the men. Having an opportunity to have a team like Cal come in and add a different caliber to the meet for the state was real helpful and it was good to see that the wom-en already stepped up a little bit from Week 1. Having this being their second competition, they re-sponded real well to the presence 
of Cal being there.”
Troy’s mention of the close 
competition the women faced 
was credited to California’s team which challenged Florida by coming within 100 points in the Invitational. 
On the other side, the men’s 
team looked sharp in its opening 
meet. 
“I saw some really good things. A lot of people competed 
with one another. We did a great job competing with FSU,” Troy said. 
“The men’s meet wasn’t quite 
as strong as the women’s meet, being there wasn’t someone to challenge us, we did a really great job of racing with one an-other within the team which is a 
really good skill for us to have as 
we go forward taking into train-ing.” 
As far as the relay teams for 
both squads, the men raced well 
this weekend after taking all ﬁ  ve 
of the races, which goes shows 
the depth they have up and down 
the roster. 
Freshman Caeleb Dressel and 
senior Matt Elliott, in particular, 
were two who stood out to Troy 
in the Invitational.
“Caeleb is a big-time talent,” 
said Troy. “He’s got great race 
instincts, good skills in all four 
strokes. ... When he’s swimming 
in the ﬁ  nals with our guys with 
a little bit of experience, it was a great experience for him. Raced extremely well. Real pleased with 
where he’s at the moment. 
“Matt is coming off a great 
summer and he’s kind of put the 
pieces together a little bit to start of the year. He’s usually been a 
traditionally slow starter but he’s 
been a real factor in training ses-
sions to this point and showing a little more leadership skills.” 
Not so much can be said for 
the women’s depth as they were 
missing ﬁ  ve of their 19 athletes 
this weekend. 
But Troy said junior Natalie 
Hinds will be a factor in every-
thing the team does considering 
she is one of the best swimmers 
in the country.16, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 8, 2014
