� THE EXTRA REVENUE WILL HELP PAY FOR 
REPAIRS, UTILITIES AND STAFF SALARIES.

  The cost of living on campus has risen by about 3 per-
cent from last year to this year, according to a UF Depart-
ment of Housing and Residence Education administrator.
  Sharon Blansett, assistant to the associate vice presi-
dent for student affairs, said the increase in rental rates for dorms will cover increases in utility costs, increases in staff salaries and fringe beneﬁ  ts.
  The extra charges will also help fund a furniture re-
placement plan and a facility renovation and repair plan.
  Dorm rates increased by an average of $66 per semes-
ter. Graduate and family housing rates increased by $15 to $30 per month, or an average of 3 percent to 4.3 percent,  On-campus 
housing rates jump 3 percent

  When Andrew Schaer heard about the 
city’s plan to replace free parking downtown 
with $1-an-hour meters, he thought of his wife and children.
  “I was scared for the well-being of my busi-
ness, and as a direct result, the well-being of my family ,” said Schaer, 34-year-old owner of Hear Again Music & Movies on Southeast First Street.
  The Gainesville City Commission alleviat-
ed his and other business owners’ fears Thurs-day when commissioners struck down the plan and sent it back to the drawing board.
  At the meeting, business owners spoke up 
to save their stores. They presented the com-mission with a petition against the meters with about 1,100 signatures collected over the summer.
  Schaer said the parking meters would’ve 
failed like they did in Sarasota. In spring, Sara-sota commissioners decided to install parking meters by stores. Three months later, the me-ters were discontinued and covered with plas-tic bags after business owners complained that they were driving away customers.
  Nava Ottenberg, who owns Persona Vin-
tage Clothing & Costumes on Southeast Sec-ond Place in Gainesville, spent two hours after work one night going from door to door to collect names of business owners who would rally against the meters.
  They didn’t need persuading. Ottenberg

  Amy L. Lakatos was a prayer warrior.
  Whenever a problem arose, the 20-year-old health educa-
tion junior was the ﬁ  rst person to shed light on the situation. Chaplain of the UF chapter of Sigma Phi Lambda, Lakatos traveled to Texas last spring to attend her Christian sorority’s retreat. But upon arriving to the airport in Tampa, she and her sorority sisters found their ﬂ  ight had been canceled. 
  “In the middle of the airport, we just grabbed hands and prayed,” Samantha Wright, secretary of the sorority and fam-ily, youth and community sciences junior, said in a phone in-terview. 
“She [Lakatos] was not shy at all — she wanted everyone 
else to know she loved Christ, and she wanted everyone else to love Christ, too.”Lakatos, a Type 1 diabetic, died in her sleep Sunday 
morning. An ardent and practiced Christian, she used her health condition to fuel her passion for her major, health, and for helping others, her friends and family said.More than 100 people gathered in a room on the second ﬂ  oor of the Reitz Union on Tuesday evening to share stories about Lakatos in a memorial service. 
One by one, Lakatos’ sorority sisters and friends from her 
high school, Calvary Christian Academy in Ft. Lauderdale, stood at the podium reciting Bible verses that either they themselves thought exempliﬁ  ed Lakatos or ones that Lakatos herself  preferred.

Tony Williams surveys damage at his Mineral, Va., home after an earthquake struck Tuesday. The most powerful 
earthquake to strike the East Coast in 67 years shook buildings from South Carolina to New England. 
NATIONAL
MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Staff Writer
The 5.8-magnitude earth-
quake that shook the East Coast 
on Tuesday seems to have left all Gators unharmed.
“As far as we know, they’re 
OK,” said UF spokesman Steve Orlando of UF graduates and students who felt the tremors of the earthquake that was cen-tered northwest of Richmond, Va. 
The New York Times re-
ported the effects were felt from New Hampshire to North Carolina.
The earthquake hit at 1:51 
p.m. Tuesday and lasted about 30 seconds, according to the New York Times.
Facebook erupted with sta-
tus updates about the earth-quake soon after. 
There were minimal reports 
of damage at the epicenter. A nearby nuclear power plant was taken offline. Amtrak trains were temporarily stopped, and cellphone service was unavail-able because too many calls were put through cellular sys-tems.Orlando said a lot of people 
are shaken up, but no one is hurt and there hasn’t been any damage to any Gators’ prop-erties other than a few broken windows.
Breanna Rossman, a 22-year-
old UF architecture alumna who graduated in May and lives in Boston, said she didn’t feel the tremors of the earthquake, but a friend on the 10th floor of a building did.
“I was just a little nervous 
just because I heard that as far as Ohio felt it and I have family there,” Rossman said.
This earthquake was rare 
because of its power, said Ray Russo, UF associate professor of geological sciences.
Usually, earthquakes in that 
area are so small no one notices them.
“It’s quite large for the re-
gion it occurred,” Russo said.
UF does not have study 
programs in the area the earth-quake hit.
Staff at the Dean of Students 
Office did not provide addi-tional information and deferred questions to UF spokespeople.Earthquake shakes D.C., shocks felt along East CoastBlansett said.
Semester rental rates for double 
rooms range from $1,953 for non-
air-conditioned rooms in Buckman Hall and Thomas Hall to $3,069 rooms in Hume Hall.
Animal sciences sophomore Ra-
chel Fishman heard about the rent increase from her roommate, who was upset with the change. Fishman said she thought her roommate said their Fletcher Hall dorm would cost about $200 more.
Fishman said she is not particu-
larly angry about the extra cost and knew she would be paying more this year than her Fletcher Hall room last year.
“I feel like they should’ve told us when we signed up for rooms, but they probably didn’t know,” she said.
Blansett said the information 
was released in the spring after the UF Board of Trustees approved it.
Rental rates are the same for stu-
dents who sign semester and year contracts, Blansett said. 
Also, UF’s Department of Hous-
ing and Residence Education sup-ports itself and does not receive tax money , Blansett said. 
The utility cost increases facing 
the department include an 11-per -
cent increase in hazardous waste disposal costs, a 3-percent increase in trash service costs and a 3-per -
cent increase in television costs.
The increase in staff salary and 
fringe benefits costs is projected to be 3 percent, Blansett said.New rates approved by 
trustees in the springservice.
“We love and treasure our stu-
dents here at the university,” Ma-
chen told Ronnie and Bob Lakatos, Lakatos’ parents, at the service. “I would only say thank you for shar -
ing your daughter with us, and we all mourn your loss.”
Lakatos also was a member of UF 
Campus Crusade for Christ, attended First Assembly of God in Gainesville and worked at the Arredondo Cafe on campus. During the summer, she worked as a lifeguard for the City of Ft. Lauderdale and the Lauderhill Parks and Recreation Department.  
Public relations senior Raychel Manko, president of Sigma Phi Lambda, grew closer to Lakatos when Lakatos was elected chaplain. She recalled a time during the soror -
ity’s recruitment week when Amy requested a fruit and veggie platter in addition to the event’s junk food. She said Lakatos encouraged her and their sorority sisters to live healthy lifestyles, too.
“I would show up to the racquet 
club and she would always be in line with one of our other sisters, ready to do Zumba,” Manko said. “You associate the gym with her.”  Friends also remember Lakatos for her optimism, reliability and sincere love of life.
Wright recalled another time 
during their sorority’s spring retreat when she and Laka-tos went to a prairie to pray.  
“Right before we sat down at a bench in this prairie, she kind of leaned over me and whispered in my ear,” Wright said. “She asked, ‘Could I keep my eyes open to look at it? Be-cause it’s so beautiful. She wanted to talk to God and see what God cre-ated at the same time.”
Ronnie Lakatos, Amy’s mother, 
spoke Tuesday at the podium beside her husband and daughter, Chris-tine. The three stood in front of the overflowed room of people and be-side easels set up with photo collages of Amy and her friends and family.  
“She glorified Christ in her life,” Ronnie Lakatos said. “She is now perfected and complete.”4, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 24, 2011

Santa Fe College took the top 
spot among the 28 state and com-
munity colleges in Florida for argu-ably the most important thing that happens in a student’s college ca-reer — graduation.
Santa Fe ranked first in a U.S. 
Department of Education list that measured graduation rates for Florida’s colleges. 
At 56.8 percent, Santa Fe had 
the highest graduation rate accord-ing to data published by the DOE’s National Center for Education Sta-tistics. Its nearest competitor on the list was Brevard Community Col-lege with a rate of 47.6 percent.  
“We’re going to continue look-
ing at our programs and what we offer to students with a constant eye toward improvement,” said Lisa Armour, associate provost and associate vice president for academic affairs at Santa Fe. “The graduation rate information is very encouraging.”
Santa Fe offers programs that 
target certain groups of students in 
an effort to help 
them succeed at the college level and ultimately graduate. 
For example, 
one program, called My Broth-er’s Keeper, sup-
ports African-American men who attend classes at the school. 
This fall, Santa Fe began the 
Pathways to Persistence Scholars Program that helps first-time col-lege students who earned GED cer -
tificates succeed.
The program has started with 
40 participating students, said An-gela Long, Santa Fe’s coordinator for student leadership and activi-ties. She is heading the Pathways operation. 
Students attend a three-hour 
class each week as part of the pro-gram, and they will also receive ad-vice and support from faculty men-tors and other Santa Fe students who volunteer to be peer connec-tors for the Pathways participants. 
At the end of the year, Long 
said she and a handful of Pathways students will travel to Washington, D.C., to give a presentation on the program to officials of the Depart-ment of Education and the White House.
As the Pathways program 
grows, it may open up to other kinds of students beyond those who have received GEDs, Long said. 
With programs like the Path-
ways operation, Santa Fe is forging ahead with further plans to bolster its students and get them from freshman orientation to gradua-tion.

Today’s question:  Would you use the new flight service 
to travel between Gainesville and Miami?
Tuesday’s question: Would you be glad 
if classes were canceled because of hur-ricane?
71 TOTAL VOTES65% YES
35% NOFans of canoeing or kayaking should be writing their Ala-
chua County Commissioners to thank them for standing up against the busy bodies at the Alachua County Parks 
Office. 
Poe Springs, a popular place for boaters of all shapes and 
sizes, was recently facing the possibility of becoming a vessel-restricted area, meaning no canoes, no kayaks and no other kinds of boats. 
Robert Avery, the parks superintendent, claimed boating 
vessels at Poe Springs were a safety issue for swimmers in the water. 
What evidence did Avery possess to show the dangers of 
these vehicles of death? 
Well, none. He presented no evidence of any sort of incident involving 
the safety of swimmers in the area. 
What about motor boats? In a spring, they could pose a po-
tential danger to people in the water, given the narrowness of many sections. 
That would be true if motor boats could actually drive 
through the low water levels of the spring. 
Skilled kayak paddlers might be able to move downstream 
pretty fast, but they don’t really pose a risk to anyone’s health and safety. 
Avery is suffering from an ailment that many bureaucratic 
officials face — nanny syndrome. 
When there is a supposed problem, these nannies believe 
that the only solution is regulating it, taxing it or banning it. 
When there is not a problem, but a “potential danger,” these 
nannies are the first to propose a preemptive strike against the terrorist threat. 
These are the same nannies that have proposed banning 
crossing the street while listening to your iPod, arresting non-violent “offenders” like prostitutes or outlawing fish pedi-cures. 
Most, if not all, nannies are not as interested in preventing 
people from hurting each other as they are in preventing peo-ple from hurting themselves. 
While swimming in Poe Springs, if you do not want to get 
hit by a canoe or a kayak, the solution is quite simple: Be care-ful, please. 
Why Avery believes he must outright ban these outdoor 
activities rather than simply telling people to be careful shows his complete lack of trust in human intelligence and common sense. 
Thankfully, the County Commission has a collective level 
head. 
They did not see any evidence of danger and chose to let the 
patrons of Poe Springs take care of themselves. 
Yes, we are in a college town, but the most important part of 
college is learning to be responsible for yourself.

crats try to micromanage your daily life.Nanny Nonsense

Freshmen forever a campus nuisance
“Can you tell me where a bus stop is?”
This was a question asked of myself and 
my friend as we were strolling down Sta-
dium Road. 
It was, of course, asked by a bewildered freshman.
Torn between my understanding that he was prob-
ably not articulating his query most effectively and my desire to get rid of him, I furrowed my brow for a mo-ment, then pointed 20 feet behind me to the nearest bus stop.
I said, “There’s one,” and resumed walking after he 
scampered off.
I know, I know, I should have asked him where he 
needed to go and directed him to the most efficacious route for his destination.
But I did not. Perhaps I have already grown cynical of the fresh-
man invasion. Now reminiscent to me of a virulent parasite descending on a prosperous and fertile land, I suppose the freshman epidemic has lost any of its nos-talgic value in my estimation. 
I am sure I share many others’ confusion at the inclu-
sion of a story describing freshman David Habib’s abso-lutely enthralling morning routine in Tuesday’s paper. I cried at the part where he said his favorite color is blue. Doesn’t Ms. Morrow know nobody cares? 
That is one of the most vital things to realize as a  
freshman: The only people who care that you are a freshman are other freshmen, hoping to band together for some sort of coalition to withstand the collective ill will of your new community.
But worry not, freshmen: Perhaps my sentiments are 
not completely universal. 
Maybe, for the most part, everyone bears goodwill 
for your successful existence at this institution. Prob-ably not, though.
Regardless of upperclassmen loathing, however, the freshman class has consistently survived all ill will thrown its way. Look at the Seminole (the UF yearbook prior to 1983) for some insight into the timeless 
tradition of freshman bashing. 
The 1954 edition describes weary orientation group 
leaders ambling around campus with a train of wide-eyed freshmen, enduring volleys of repeated obvious questions such as, “What time does writing lab meet on Monday?” “Where do I get my football tickets?” etc., etc. 
I am sure all Preview students can relate to the 1955 
edition’s description of orientation as “group leaders loading you with information soon forgotten, later re-membered as being somewhat exaggerated but in good faith.” 
Another eternal tradition emerges in the description 
of Greeks descending on the freshman class like rav-enous wolves in search of new frat boys and sorority girls. Though now their rush week tactics have more of a luring mentality to them, the outcome is essentially the same.
More common ground is found in the 1949 edition’s 
description of freshman registration as the “epitome of torture,” but let’s not forget the  present-day advantag-es of the Internet and, praise the Lord, AC.
So there you have it, freshies. While you may be a 
cancerous growth or an abundance of sticky platelets clogging the vital arteries of our grand institution, you have always been viewed that way. 
The majority of you have survived, and you will 
probably feel the same way in a year or so. 
And be thankful: If I had my way, you would all still 
have to wear rat caps.

Speaking Out WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 24, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 7
The so-called “super committee,” part of the new deal to 
raise the debt ceiling, is bound to fail at its goal of cutting spending — and here’s why.
In Washington, it always seems like a piece of proposed 
legislation has the potential to succeed. From the “Gang of Six” grand bargain in the Senate to the “McConnell plan” that would give President Barack Obama unilateral authority to raise the debt ceiling, plans and proposals are never in short supply.
The special committee is yet another one, given authority 
to propose spending cuts and (gulp) tax increases subject to an up-or-down vote in Congress.
On paper, it looks like a great proposal: Name three mem-
bers of each party from each house of Congress to a commit-tee and have them hash out spending cuts from discretionary spending and funds given to Medicare providers (read: doc-tors and hospitals).
Unlike the president’s deficit committee (the infamous 
Bowles-Simpson proposal), this group would only require a bare majority to pass its legislation. That means that, in theory, one Republican could join six Democrats, or vice-versa, in pass-ing recommendations on to Congress.
These recommendations would be subject to an up-or-
down vote in Congress: no filibuster, no amendments. Presi-dent Obama retains veto power, but if a bipartisan committee and both houses pass these, it’s hard to imagine him vetoing the legislation, given his penchant for compromise. To those who say he didn’t compromise, remember: The president’s first preference was a clean raise of the debt ceiling, then a deal with revenue increases. He got neither of those things.
And here’s the kicker: If the committee is hopelessly dead-
locked, a “trigger” built into the recently passed debt ceiling extension forces automatic, massive cuts. These are geared to hurt both parties’ priorities: defense spending for Republicans and domestic spending for Democrats. This “trigger,” in theo-ry, should force parties to deal with each other in the interest of compromise.It all sounds so simple and beau-
tiful. Parties either compromise or we cut anyway , equally from both parties’ policy preferences. Bring the smartest people from each party to-
gether and we’ll get a historic compromise. They can even pro-pose revenue increases by reforming the tax code!
There are a couple big, gaping holes in the legislation. First, 
it leaves the so-called “entitlement” programs — Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security — free from the touches of either the committee or the trigger.
I’m a Democrat, and a fairly liberal one at that. But I, con-
trary to some voices in my party, know Medicare is the pri-mary driver of our national debt. Not Social Security, not Med-icaid, not defense, not the infamous Bush tax cuts, not the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and not the “hostilities” in Libya. It’s Medicare.
The United States spends far more than any industrialized 
nation on health care services due to a number of flaws within our system that are defended by a powerful, national health care and insurance lobby. To his credit, President Obama al-ready made significant cuts to Medicare and many reforms that, if even half of them pan out, will slow the growth in Medi-care spending and the system overall. But this committee can’t make any further reforms.
Second among the holes is the structure of the committee 
itself. Nearly every economist agrees that to fix the deficit, one has to be realistic. That means revenue increases. It is possible to generate revenue from reforming and simplifying the tax code, but reform hasn’t happened since 1988. Loopholes have piled up and they make our tax code many volumes long.
The “Gang of Six” proposed tax reform to raise revenue 
while lowering marginal tax rates on all income brackets. That plan won significant bipartisan support in the Senate from con-servatives with impeccable credentials, like Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.).
But let’s be realistic with this committee. Sen. Mitch McCon-nell (R-Ky.) and Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) are not about to name Republicans to the committee ready to wheel and deal on tax reform that raises revenue. To House Republicans, at least, any increase in revenue is anathema.
That’s not a partisan point of view. Standard & Poor’s 
downgraded the United States’ sovereign debt from AAA to AA+ (Moody’s and Fitch Ratings kept our rating at AAA). Rea-sons given for this involve political gridlock, the last-minute nature of the deal, and, notably, assumptions on revenues. S&P said “the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues.”
Why does the downgrade matter? Well, it might not mat-
ter much at first. But Treasury bonds are the base of the en-tire global financial system. If they’re not safe, what debt is? Moreover, a downgrade will likely make the interest rates on everything from credit cards to student loans (sorry, fellow stu-dents) rise.
So let’s recap: This committee won’t work because it doesn’t 
touch the primary driver of our debt growth, and its members aren’t going to consider revenues as part of a solution.
But wait! There’s more.Remember how this committee has to cut from Democratic 
and Republican priorities? Both parties are going to scramble to find as much “fake math” as they can to “cut” from defense and domestic spending while not really cutting. 
We needed to raise the debt ceiling. Many economists from 
left to right agreed it should simply be a clean raise with no conditions attached,  and some applauded that it finally made Congress take debt reduction seriously. Regardless, it was raised at the last minute with a deal of all spending cuts.
We didn’t default, and that’s a good thing.We raised it past the election (with this trigger deal) so we 
don’t have to deal with another crisis before November 2012. The United States is still standing, and the world hasn’t quite entered financial panic.

UWire8, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 24, 2011
ERIN JESTER
Alligator Writer
UF has modified its proposal to provide 
staff members with a 3 percent raise to 
counteract a state law that requires public employees to contribute 3 percent of their salaries to retirement.
Instead of the proposed plan to cut 40 
hours of annual vacation time, UF is now proposing a cap of 400 hours, or five weeks, on unused vacation hours paid to staff members leaving the university.
According to UF Human Resource Ser -
vices, the number of paid vacation hours for eligible staff would also be reduced to 352 hours from 480 hours. Vacation leave more than the maximum amount of hours at the end of the year would be converted to sick leave. 
By cutting paid vacation time, Machen 
hopes to restore the salary cuts with an equal pay raise, according to Scott Nygren, faculty senate chair. 
“The idea is certainly a laudable one,” 
Nygren said. 
Nygren said Machen’s proposal would 
mostly affect the 65 percent of UF staff who earn less than $75,000 a year. 
Faculty members earning less than 
$75,000 and those who are within five years of retirement will also feel the brunt of the new state law. 
As of Tuesday, the proposal was amend-
ed to exclude faculty, allowing more time for discussion during the fall semester. 
Paula Fussell, vice president of human 
resources, said faculty members were con-cerned about leave changes taking effect be-fore their salaries were affected, so they are being given more time to discuss the chang-es. Assuming they can reach an agreement, Fussell said faculty salary changes will be implemented in January. 
In an email, Machen said UF administra-
tion is trying to simplify the proposals and ensure pay raise for staff is ap-proved immediately.
“It is our hope and ex-
pectation that discussions with faculty will occur in 
the fall and result in a proposal to the trustees 
in December,” Machen wrote in the email.
Only employees who earn less than 
$75,000 will receive the 3-percent pay raise in September. The rest of the staff will re-ceive raises in January. 
The Board of Trustees will vote on the proposal during its Sept. 6 meeting. If the board approves the changes, both the leave changes and salary increase will take effect for staff in September.
Fussell said staff regards the proposal 
positively. “They’re happy we’ve been able to modify the proposal, and they’re very happy about getting the 3 percent in Sep-tember,” she said. 
With a $50-million budget cut this year, 
Fussell said changes in employee benefits was the only way to balance salary cuts, and making changes to vacation time was the most flexible way to do that.
“I think this shows that we listen and 
that we care about our employees, and we’re trying to do the best we can to find a workable solution that would allow us to provide the 3 percent,” Fussell said. 
Machen is expected to acknowledge the 
issue during his State of the University ad-dress Thursday.

Chris Rainey, UF running back 
(on coach Will Muschamp)Gators basketball names new assistant
On Tuesday, Florida announced Preston Greene has

Although Florida coach Will Muschamp recently tried to dismiss it as a rumor, running backs Jeff Demps 
and Chris Rainey have reportedly been taking snaps in a version of the Wildcat formation in practice.
TOM GREEN
Alligator Staff Writer
Gators coach Will Muschamp is 
looking for any competitive edge 
he can get entering his first season.
That includes attempting to 
control what information, and how much of it, gets out to the public.
“It’s an advantage for us this 
season not to show [our hand],” Muschamp said Saturday. “What is Charlie doing? Is he doing what he did at Notre Dame? Kansas City? New England? How is he us-ing this guy, this guy, this guy?
“Defensively, are we doing Dan 
Quinn or Will Muschamp? Are we 3-4 or are we 4-3? I don’t know. That’s why we’ve closed things.”
It’s also why Muschamp is cur-
rently the sole voice of news — injuries and otherwise — coming from the Gators until coordinators Charlie Weis and Dan Quinn are made available to the media dur-ing game weeks.
Along with keeping as much 
information as possible under wraps, Muschamp even jokingly claimed the team intentionally dis-seminated a rumor last week about experimenting with the Wildcat formation with Jeff Demps, Chris Rainey, Trey Burton and Jordan Reed. But Rainey and Demps, when asked, both  said they have been  taking snaps in the Wildcat during fall camp.
Reed on punt returns: Mus-
champ has stressed the importance of playing his best players on spe-cial teams and having starters that want to contribute. 
He noted receivers Deonte 
Thompson and Quinton Dunbar have been among the most willing to put in work.
The most surprising name 
among kick returners, though, could be 6-foot-3, 239-pound tight end Jordan Reed.
“A guy of his size catching it 
and getting vertical on a gunner is pretty exciting,” Muschamp said.
Etc.: Freshman defensive back 
De’Ante “Pop” Saunders has re-portedly been working at safety, and freshman Chris Johnson has moved from safety to linebacker.

Coach Will Muschamp recently 
credited the Southeastern Conference’s 
dominance to the league’s defensive lines, but it’s the running back position that may be the most talented. 
Despite facing some of the nation’s 
best defenses on a weekly basis, SEC backs have consistently produced solid seasons and have been staples of cham-pionship contenders. 
Even after Alabama’s Mark Ingram 
and LSU’s Stevan Ridley were selected in the first and third round, respective-ly, of the 2011 NFL Draft, the talent and depth at the position is still among the finest in the country . 
“They’re some of the best,” UF run-ning back Jeff Demps said of his SEC counterparts. “It’s a tough conference, and they come in each week and take the pounding ... and still seem to do good.”
When asked who was the best of 
the bunch, Demps, running back Chris Rainey , defensive tackle Jaye Howard 
and lineback-ers Jelani Jenkins and Jon Bostic all 
mentioned the same two names: Trent Richardson and Marcus Lattimore. 
Richardson, who split time with 
Ingram in the Alabama backfield last season, is projected by many to be the best back in the nation this season due Conference loaded with 
talent at running backMiami scandal: Time to tattle
Dear every gangster rapper ever,
Just this once, can snitches not get 
stitches? Please?
Listen, Obie Trice, Ice Cube, Cam’ron and 
every other rapper reading this: Let’s give the snitches a pass, just this once. If we let them slide, they could help the NCAA reel in the big fish.
Julie Roe Lach, the NCAA vice president of 
enforcement, hinted to CBSSports.com on Mon-day that the association is using limited immu-nity as part of its investigation of Miami. Limited immunity can be granted to “a student athlete who provides information when such individual otherwise might be declared ineligible for inter -
collegiate competition that he or she reports,” ac-cording to the NCAA Manual.
For a better understanding, picture any fic-
tional police interrogation scene. 
Now, who exactly could be snitching, stitch-
free?
Lach made it clear that she was only speak-
ing in broad terms, but she said prospects who receive extra benefits from one school and sign with another one aren’t pursued unless those benefits happened to come from an agent.
While gone-rogue ‘Canes fan Nevin Shapiro 
was involved with a sports agency, he was not an agent, so the seven players named by Ya-hoo! who signed else-where — including UF’s Andre Debose and Matt Patchan — should still be eligible, regardless of the inves-tigation’s outcome.
But what about players who went to Miami 
and transferred, namely Purdue quarterback Robert Marve and Kansas State linebacker Ar -
thur Brown? The Yahoo! report alleges that Mar -
ve, who graduated from Tampa Plant High in 2007, received a couple of dinners at an upscale Miami restaurant, at least one cash gift, food/en-tertainment at Shapiro’s mansion and drinks and VIP access at Miami strip clubs and nightclubs.
Brown, meanwhile, was apparently given a 
dinner at Benihana, a lunch, two rooms at the Continental Oceanfront Hotel, a trip to the bowl-ing alley (yup) and drinks and “private enter -
tainment” at a local strip club. 
Both reports are backed by additional sourc-
es, credit card statements and — in Marve’s case — photos.  UF FOOTBALL

twitter: @tyler_jettto his rare combination of size (5-foot-
11, 224 pounds) and speed. He ran for 700 yards on 112 carries last year and should play a bigger role as a junior. 
  Lattimore, meanwhile, is a player 
the Gators know far too well. In last year’s meeting against South Carolina — a 36-14 Gamecocks victory — Latti-more carried the ball 40 times, tallying 215 yards and three touchdowns. 
  “Honestly , the best I played against 
besides Mark Ingram was probably Lattimore,” Howard said. “He’s explo-sive. He’s a big dude. It’s hard to bring him down.”
  The SEC also features Tauren Poole 
at Tennessee, Vick Ballard at Mississip-pi State and Brandon Bolden at Missis-sippi, each of whom weighs more than 215 pounds and ran for at least 950 yards and double-digit touchdowns in 2010. 
  The group would be even stronger 
had Knile Davis, the SEC’s leading rusher among running backs last year, not suffered a season-ending left ankle injury during fall camp. 
  Even Vanderbilt, which ﬁ  nished 1-7 
in conference play last season, features 2009 SEC Freshman of the Year War-ren Norman at running back. 
  “It’s crazy ,” Howard said. “Each 
week in the SEC you have to come out and play. You could play Vanderbilt and they’d give us a rough time.”
  Contact Greg Luca at gluca@alligator.
org   If the Yahoo! allegations are proven true, Marve and 
Brown would be looking at multi-game suspensions. In-
stead, both were cleared by their schools just a day after the report came out last week.
  Assuming Marve and Brown can be used as pawns in the 
NCAA’s investigation, granting them limited immunity is the right call. In a case like this, with widespread cheating touching 72 players and spanning eight years, the target is obviously the university, not the athletes. 
  Pretend the NCAA put the heat on Marve and Brown. 
Pretend both received the most severe punishment: a ban for the rest of their careers. Big Ten bottom-dweller Purdue would lose its starting quarterback for one season; K-State would lose a linebacker with 17 tackles to his name for two.
  Who cares? Their testimonies are much more valuable, 
especially for Marve, who never got a fair shake at The U.  
  So, gangster rappers (thanks for reading, by the way), can 
we please just overlook Marve and Brown and every other potential corroborator? I know tattling isn’t cool, but this is kind of important.

�   POLHAMUS COACHED AT 
GEORGIA TECH, WINTHROP.
BRYAN HOLT
 Alligator Writer
  In 2003, Georgia Tech’s volleyball 
team rode a fast-paced, unique offense 
into the NCAA Regional Finals. 
  Florida coach Mary Wise compared 
the Yellow Jackets to the fast-break Loyola Marymount basketball teams of the late 1980s that implemented a rule requiring players to shoot within seven seconds of a possession. 
  Helping lead the charge strategical-
ly for that Georgia Tech squad was as-sistant coach Sally Polhamus, a former Xavier standout. On Friday , she will begin a new era of her career when she takes the bench for the ﬁ  rst time as a Florida assistant.
  “We wanted to be unique in defense 
and we want to be unique in offense,” Wise said. “That’s why we asked Sally to come on board, and we’re thrilled. We have a great staff here.”
  For the past four years, Polhamus 
was the head coach at Winthrop. In that time, she became the third-winningest head coach in program history with a record of 64-59. But she resigned from Winthrop in March to take the job as offensive coordinator and recruiting coordinator at Florida.
  “I have incredible respect for coach 
Wise and the tradition and family she has created at the Universi-
ty of Florida,” Polhamus said in an of-ﬁ  cial statement. “I am looking forward to becoming a part of this tremendous staff and assisting in the recruitment, training and guidance of elite current and future Gator student-athletes.”
  The idea of bringing in a coach to 
change offensive schemes might be puzzling to some who follow Florida volleyball. After all, the Gators had one of the strongest offenses in the Southeastern Conference in 2010 and were weaker on backcourt defense than anything else.
  But junior setter Sundai Weston 
said Polhamus’ offensive philosophy will be refreshing for the Gators and will only make the team’s attack stron-ger. 
  “She’s a lot like [assistant coach] 
Dave [Boos],” she said. “Dave’s a de-fensive schemer and she’s an offensive schemer. People are going to be ex-cited to see not only the power but the thought process behind what we’re doing with all that strength.”
  Wise hopes Florida’s offense can 
be as cutting-edge as the ones Georgia Tech touted during Polhamus’ tenure there. 
  The Gators haven’t reached a Re-
gional Final since 2005, but with the talent level up front, Florida could capitalize on adding a new mindset to an already quick and powerful of-fense.

Florida soccer coach Becky Burleigh has relied heavily on her bench 
during the team’s first two games despite an abundance of freshmen.
� BURLEIGH PLAYING FRESHMEN EARLY. 
JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Staff Writer
Last season, UF coach Becky Burleigh had more 
players on the roster than in any of her previous 
15 years at Florida, but it still wasn’t enough.
Even with a school-record 38 athletes, the coach 
trusted just nine players to come off the bench in 2010’s two opening matchups, including a 2-1 overtime thriller against Miami.
For all her team’s numbers, Burleigh said, it 
lacked the quality depth that she is currently en-joying with her smaller 2011 squad. 
“It’s definitely going to be a strength this year,” 
she said. “That’s something that is pretty evident. There’s a lot of players who are capable of being in our starting group, and that’s a coach’s dream.”
During No. 9 Florida’s (2-0-0) opening slate 
against Miami (1-1-0) and FIU (0-2-0) last week-end, Burleigh sent in 16 new players – compared to just 10 by opponents, who were slowly worn down by the wave of reinforcements.
Only seven Gators started both contests, and 
the competition on the team has been ramping up to see who will play this weekend against No. 11 Texas A&M (1-1-0) and No. 16. UCLA (1-0-0) in 
Knoxville, Tenn.
“Nobody is complacent and everybody’s fight-
ing for a spot and for time,” redshirt junior McK-
enzie Barney said. “Everybody making each other better is the biggest thing this year. That’s the dif-ference.”After starting 22 games and finishing last sea-
son as UF’s leading goal scorer, Barney began this year on the bench and didn’t play against the Hur -
ricanes until the 28th minute. 
While the midfielder eventually worked her 
way back into the starting unit by logging a team-high four shots on goal during the weekend, noth-ing is set in stone.
“It’s wiped clean every single year and that’s 
what drives and motivates our team,” Barney said. “But at the end of the day, it’s all about our team. We want the 11 in there who, at the time, are going to make the most difference and get the [win.]”
Perhaps nowhere else is the team’s depth more
