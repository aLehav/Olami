LYNCHING MEMORIAL
Nushrat Nur // Alligator Staff

CONTINUES TO RECOVER AT 
UF HEALTH SHANDS 
By Sarah Mandile
Alligator Staff Writer
When a few brothers of UF’s Theta Chi Fraternity 
walked into Mitch Capps’ hospital room last Tuesday, 
they weren’t sure what to expect. 
But as they entered the room inside UF Health Shands, 
they were pleasantly surprised to be greeted with a smile. 
“Oh, hey gang,” Capps warmly said. 
Nearly three weeks after falling from the fourth ﬂ  oor 
of a parking garage, Capps remains bedridden at UF 
Health Shands. However, his recovery has been steady, 
his father, Bryan Capps Sr., said. In about a month, he 
expects his son may be relocated to a rehab facility.
Capps Sr. said it’s “a miracle” his son survived the 
60-foot fall that left him with multiple broken bones and 
a serious brain injury. At one point during Capps’ recov-
ery, he had a tracheostomy, a feeding tube inserted and 
was placed on a ventilator. 
“Everything has been removed now so he’s breathing 
on his own, talking on his own, complaining and talking 
constantly,” Capps Sr. “He won’t shut up.” 
During the past few weeks, Capps’ hospital room has 
been frequented by family, friends and members of the 
community offering their love and support. 
Capps Sr. said his son, a 22-year-old UF forest re-
sources and conservation junior and member of Theta 
Chi Fraternity, has always been an outdoorsy and active 
person. So, him being conﬁ  ned to a hospital room for 
over three weeks hasn’t exactly sat well, he said.
While at ﬁ  rst Capps wasn’t responding to anything, 
he gradually began responding to commands to wiggle 
his toes and squeeze his ﬁ  ngers, Capps Sr. said.
“It’s been remarkable,” Capps Sr. said. 
April Zee, Capps’ friend from for-
estry classes, said he was asleep the 
ﬁ  rst few times she visited. But as the 
weeks progressed, he started open-
ing his eyes and chatting with visi-
tors, she said. 
“It’s like inﬁ  nitely better than 
what anyone would have expected,” 
Zee, a 21-year-old UF forest resource Student’s condition

DREW DEES IS USING A POWER 
WHEELCHAIR TO ADVANCE 
HIS CAREER
By AJ Bafer
Alligator Contributing Writer
Drew Dees is enhancing his interviews now 
that he can see his sources at eye level. 
The 24-year-old UF telecommunication ju-
nior was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and 
has used a wheelchair his entire life. Two weeks ago, he upgraded to a Permobil F5 Cor-
pus VS power wheelchair, which allows him 
to do anything a person in a standing position 
can.
Dees said he wanted a standing chair be-
cause of how it would improve his experiences 
in both everyday life and as a reporter. Before 
the chair, people would often crouch and talk 
down to him while he was reporting on news 
stories. 
He said the chair will allow him to do de-
monstrative stand-ups, allowing him to be more interactive as a news journalist. He said 
that along with helping him further his career, 
the chair has boosted his conﬁ  dence.
“Being able to be on eye level with people, 
being able to stand up for photos…it’s just 
been a game-changer,” he said.
The chair can be completely controlled 
with a joystick and can change from a sitting 
to a standing position at the push of a button, 
Dees said. It has pieces below his knees and 
across his chest to keep balance.
Dees said his ﬁ  rst time standing in the chair was nerve-racking because he didn’t know if it 
would support him. He is still getting used to 
the change but said he has started to love it. 
Dees said he used the chair’s standing fea-
ture for the ﬁ  rst time in a speech to UF alumni 
and administration. He said he is humbled and 
blessed to be able to continue his mission to 
use his disability as a platform to reach other 
people and said he is happy to know that the 
technology is available for those who may not 
be able to stand.By Gracie Johnson

Miracles in Color4   ALLIGATOR    MONDAY, FEBRUARY 10, 2020KIRK TAPLEY IS AMONG 
THE YOUNGEST TO WIN 
THE AWARD 
By Hope Dean
Alligator Staff Writer
Kirk Tapley, an advanced 
world history teacher at Howard 
W. Bishop Middle School, has a 
special room in his house.
The office that doubles as a 
guest bedroom is filled with me-
mentos from his four years of 
teaching. Cards, printed emails 
and hand-written notes from stu-
dents are nearly filed in a drawer. 
A giant check he once won for his 
classroom efforts hangs on the 
wall. 
The newest addition is a crys-
tal apple that rests on the book-
shelf. Two other teachers also 
won the apple, which represents 
that they were finalists for the 
2020 Alachua County Teacher of 
the Year award, but Tapley has something they 
don’t — a certifi-
cate proclaiming 
him as the win-
ner. 
Each Alachua 
County public 
school names 
its own teacher 
of the year, and 
each winner votes for the official 
2020 Alachua County Teacher of 
the Year. This year’s winner was 
announced during a banquet on 
Jan. 30. 
At 26, Tapley is one of the 
youngest teachers to win the 
award, said Michael Gamble, 
Howard W. Bishop Middle School 
Principal. 
Tapley was up against Kasey 
Norris from Alachua Elementary 
School and Joshua Forgione  from 
Gainesville High School.
“There’s a lot of talented 
teachers out there that have been 
paying their dues for quite some 
time, but I think (Tapley) really moved the profession forward,” 
Gamble said. 
Tapley teaches in the same 
classroom he once learned world 
history in as a middle schooler, 
but he runs the class a little dif-
ferently than his teacher did back 
then. 
Tapley is known for his uncon-
ventional teaching methods — 
namely DJ Globe Up, a character 
he plays in class to help students 
review learning materials. 
With a painted turkey baster 
as a microphone and a cardboard 
necklace with the word “history” 
strung around his neck, Tapley 
climbs on top of chairs and desks 
and raps his own made-up history 
lyrics to songs like “That’s What 
I Like” by Bruno Mars and “Can’t 
Stop the Feeling!” by Justin Tim-
berlake. 
“I needed a way to review 
what we learned the day before 
without it being mundane and 
boring,” Tapley said. 
Students in Tapley’s class also learn practical lessons such 
as how to change a tire, bal-
ance a checkbook and file taxes 
alongside topics about India and 
Europe, he said. “A lot of times 
you’re learning stuff in school 
and you’re thinking, ‘When am I 
ever going to use this in the real 
world?’” Tapley said. “I can’t 
guarantee that somebody down 
the road is going to teach them 
these skills, so I might as well 
take the responsibility.” 
Ryan Black, a 12-year-old stu-
dent in Tapley’s class, said Tap-
ley is her favorite teacher. Black 
and her friends made a poster for 
Tapley during the banquet and 
cheered like crazy when he won, 
she said. 
“If I’ve had a bad morning, 
he makes it better just by giving 
me a high-five because it lets me 
know that he’s there for me and 
that he cares,” she said. “I think 
he’s the best teacher that I’ve 
ever had and probably will have.”
Tapley will soon send an appli-cation to officials from the Florida 
Teacher of the Year Program, who 
will review each county’s chosen 
teacher and likely choose a state-
wide winner in July, said Karen 
Clarke, Alachua County Schools 
Superintendent. 
The winner spends a year 
away from the classroom to tour 
Florida schools and work with the 
State Department of Education, 
Clarke said. No one from Alachua 
County has ever won. 
If he were to win, Tapley said 
he would fight for higher teacher 
pay and flexibility in curriculums. 
“I decided to teach in Alachua 
County because I know what it 
did for me and my life,” he said.  
“And if I’m able to repay it and 
represent Alachua County well 
as (Florida) Teacher of the Year, 
then I will do that.”

“It’s not about me,” Dees said. “It’s about the future 
generation of people with disabilities.”
He first learned about the standing chair back in Oc-
tober from Custom Mobility, the wheelchair company he 
got his previous chairs from and has been in contact with 
since he was only two days old, he said. He was fitted 
for the chair in early December and acquiring it was a three-monthlong process.
Gaetano Mandala, territory sales manager at the 
chair’s manufacturer Permobil, said Dees’ chair costs 
from $55,000 to $65,000 which can be reduced depend-
ing on insurance and available Medicare reimbursement 
that pays for the basic parts of the chair.
Dees said his chair was paid for by his insurance, and 
he requested it twice for it to finally be approved.
Mandala said the standing wheelchair was first devel-
oped about 30 years ago to give people the ability to ac-
cess daily living activities when they were otherwise un-
able to. He said the chair has aided those in professional 
fields like teaching and surgery, enabling those with dis-
abilities to be independent and part of the community.
Dees’s chair is unique because it can be programmed 
depending on a specific person’s ability to stand to spe-
cially accommodate them with technology called smart 
actuators, Mandala said. He said it is the only chair in the 
industry with this capability.
The chair also offers the medical benefits of stand-
ing such as reducing bone thinning by allowing normal 
bone and joint development, assisting with digestion and 
respiration, reducing depression and lowering injury risk 
for overhead reaching, Mandala said.
Mandala said Permobil is the oldest power chair com-
pany in the world and their chairs are known for their 
durability, being able to last 10-20 years.
“It’s always the patient first,” he said. “We don’t 
build chairs for codes. We build chairs for people within 
those codes.”
 and conservation junior, said. 
Throughout their friendship, Zee 
and Capps have bonded over their 
shared love for music. During Zee’s 
recent visits, she said she played 
Capps’ favorite music for him, rang-
ing from folk music to Mac Miller. 
He passes the time in his hospital 
bed by singing along, she said.
Zee recalls Capps bringing a 
speaker along when they would 
walk to class, blaring his favorite 
music for everyone to hear. His 
carefree attitude has taught her to 
be more easy-going, she said.  
“I just take a step back and en-
joy what’s happening in front of me 
instead of being so stressed all the 
time,” she said. 
Jack Abbruzzese, a 21-year-old 
sustainability and the built environ-
ment senior and member of the fra-
ternity, visited Capps’ on Tuesday 
alongside other Theta Chi Fraternity 
brothers.
Abbruzzese said Capps asked 
what his friends’ plans were for the 
night and jokingly asked if he could 
join them.
“It was really reassuring that his 
personality shines through, even though he’s still recovering mental-
ly and physically,” Abbruzzese said.
A fundraiser event called Mitch-
Fest, organized by Abbruzzese, was 
held at Theta Chi Fraternity Friday. 
The evening consisted of perfor-
mances by Kamasutra (Capps’ fa-
vorite local band), art vendors, a 
silent disco and food and drinks. 
Kamasutra asked Capps’ friends 
and family for his favorite songs and 
played covers of them throughout 
their performance Friday, Abbruzz-
ese said. 
Although he hasn’t totaled ev-
erything up yet, he estimates the 
event raised about $3,000 for Capps 
and his family. A portion of the pro-
ceeds came from the sale of t-shirts 
made with Capps’ artwork, he said. 
Zee, who also joined Capps 
friends and family at MitchFest, 
thinks selling t-shirts with Capps’ 
artwork was a thoughtful touch to 
the event. She said she feels thank-
ful for all of the support Capps has 
received and hopes it continues.
“I hope he continues to keep 
healing at the rate he is,” Zee said.” 
You know, so that he can get back 
on his feet and go back out in the 
woods.”

many of the UF programs in Australia are 
located far from the worst of the damage, 
she added.
Media portrayals of the fires show a heat 
map of Australia covered almost entirely by 
orange heat flares, which is incorrect, Good-
behere said.
“A lot of people misinterpret these flares 
as fires when really they could just be the 
heat coming off of someone’s roof,” she 
said. “When I visited the United States, I noticed that a lot of the news seemed very 
sensationalized.”
Johan De Jesus, a 21-year-old UF con-
struction management senior, is in Austra-
lia on the study exchange program for UF’s 
construction school. 
“My program hasn’t been affected at 
all to my knowledge,” De Jesus said. “I’m 
studying in the heart of Melbourne, which 
isn’t as affected as other areas.” 
The construction management program 
isn’t the only study abroad trip to Australia 
this year. Florida Down Under is a travel 
tour organization with a program based in North Queensland, and it runs through the 
UF College of Health and Human Perfor-
mance to focus on environmental sustain-
ability. 
The program’s location is about 1,500 
miles from the epicenter of the fires, said 
Heather Gibson, the faculty program direc-
tor for Florida Down Under and professor in 
the department of tourism, hospitality and 
event management.
“If we translated the fires to the United 
States and they were concentrated in Mi-
ami, our trip would be all the way up in 
Boston,” she said. Not only will the program be unaffected 
geographically, but Gibson said the trip’s 
content will actually benefit academically 
from the recent fires because Florida Down 
Under focuses on climate change. 
“Our local field guides will have a lot to 
say about the fires and the cause,” she said.
Ultimately, Gibson said she believes that 
going to Australia will help benefit the com-
munity and the support is needed now more 
than ever.
“Whenever a disaster strikes, the best 
way to help is by bringing them tourism 
dollars,” Gibson said. “Supporting small 
businesses is one way we can enable local 
communities to grow. Those locals can then 
go on to help the rest of Australia.”CHAIR,  from pg. 1 MITCH,  from pg. 1

Gainesville for its dedication to ur-
ban forestry by naming it a “tree 
city of the world.” 
This designation has only been 
received by 59 other cities, 23 of 
which are in the U.S. and four are 
in Florida, said Brian Watkins, 
an arborist for the city’s urban 
forestry division. Gainesville has 
received the Tree City USA des-
ignation for 37 years straight, but 
this is the first year it’s been con-
sidered a “tree city of the world,” 
according to Gainesville’s website.
The Gainesville Urban Forestry 
Division applied for the designa-
tion in October and was notified of 
its recognition on Jan. 31. The city 
had to meet five core standards 
to receive its title: establishing 
responsibility, setting the rules, 
knowing what you have, allocat-ing the resources and celebrating 
achievements. 
The award recognizes Gaines-
ville’s urban forestry work on an 
international level, Watkins said. 
He said departments in South 
Carolina, Texas and California call 
Gainesville’s office to ask how to 
model their land codes and poli-
cies after it.
“We have been making a lot 
of partnerships, not only with cit-
ies in Florida but also with cities 
around the world,” Watkins said. 
“That’s been a really good use of 
having this recognition.”
Watkins said 47 percent of 
Gainesville is covered in trees, 
putting Gainesville above the op-
timal amount of 45 percent, which 
he said was found in a tree canopy 
coverage ecological analysis. The 
city government works to pre-
serve Gainesville’s tree canopies, 
remove old or decaying trees and 
replenish them with healthy ones. 
This award will benefit the 
community and showcase the 
city’s care for its forests, said Shel-
by Taylor, the city’s spokesperson. 
“It is an indicator to people in our community and beyond of our 
commitment to our urban forests,” 
Taylor said. “Oftentimes, govern-
ment does a lot of good things be-
hind the scenes to maintain a rich 
tree canopy.”
The city’s government wants to 
reassure Gainesville residents the 
city is committed to the sustain-
ability of local urban forests, Tay-
lor said. Maintaining clean air and 
improving oxygen flow are the ef-
fects of successful urban forestry 
and a source of city government 
pride. 
There has not been a formal 
ceremony yet, but one is being 
planned and expected to be in 
April, Watkins said.
“This is a world recognition,” 
Watkins said. “It is kinda cool 
to be amongst the elite when it 
comes to urban forestry and how 
we manage our urban forestry.”

OTHER DEVICES STILL

Students living in dorms can’t 
call for Alexa. That’s because the 
Amazon Echo Dot can’t connect to 
residential WiFi. 
The Amazon Echo Dot is 
currently being evaluated to 
make sure there are no security or 
connectivity issues, Matt Pendleton, 
senior director of information 
technology for student affairs, wrote 
in an email. The residential network 
allows students living on campus to 
access the internet, except for those 
in sororities and fraternities. 
After the product has been 
evaluated, UF IT for Student Affairs 
will begin to help students connect 
their devices, Pendleton wrote. 
All approved entertainment 
devices must first be registered in 
order to connect to the residential network. Students 
can register if 
they are primary 
residents on the 
housing contract 
and submit the 
correct make and 
model as well as 
the MAC address 
of the device.
Devices such as the Amazon TV 
Firestick, Roku and Apple TV are all 
allowed on the residential network 
while the Amazon Echo Dot is still 
being approved. Other unsupported 
devices include Google Home 
devices, Apple Homepods, wireless 
printers and smart light bulbs, 
plugs and scales. Pendleton wrote 
that Echo is being evaluated as an 
“Active Listening Device.” 
“We’ve had a number of 
Amazon Echo Dot requests,” 
Pendleton wrote. “Those requests 
were initially denied to further 
evaluate the product.”
The Alligator has emailed 
Pendleton four times and called 
three times in two days with additional questions and was given 
no date or estimate as to when 
Echo would be approved for the 
residential network. The Alligator 
also contacted Tracy Gale, UF IT’s 
spokesperson, via email three times 
and called once in the span of two 
days but still received no responses 
to the questions. 
The Alligator also asked what 
is being done about Echo not 
being accepted into the network 
after Pendelton initally said that 
“a number of Amazon Echo Dot 
requests” were filed.
Ursula Duran, a 19-year-old 
accounting freshman, received the 
Amazon Echo Dot as a gift from 
her father before moving into Beaty 
Towers West. She has been unable 
to use it since receiving it in August. 
“It’s a little frustrating because 
you purchase something wanting 
to use it and then you can’t,” Duran 
said.

Ella McIver’s grandparents celebrated her 
grandfather’s 80th birthday with a cruise 
throughout Asia on the Diamond Princess, 
but the trip has lasted longer than expected.
A quarantine on the ship began Monday 
after a man from Hong Kong who had dis-
embarked from the ship tested positive for 
coronavirus. The quarantine has a Feb. 19 
end date.
McIver, an 18-year-old UF English and art 
history freshman, said she has only been able 
to contact her grandparents through email, 
which has been difficult because of the 14-
hour time difference.    Jan Swartz, the president of Princess 
Cruises, wrote in a statement Saturday that 
six additional coronavirus cases, including 
five crew members, were confirmed on the 
Diamond Princess. There are 70 total cases 
with more than 3,700 onboard, according to 
The New York Times. 
“It’s now just sort of a waiting game and 
there’s really nothing we can all do except 
just let them stay in their quarantine,” she 
said. “They can’t leave their cabin.”
Linda Potts, 74, and Michael Terence 
Potts, 80, flew from England and boarded the 
Diamond Princess on Jan. 20 in Tokyo. Word 
search, television and their three books have 
been their saving grace in the cramped room.
“Japan was a place we hadn’t been to before, and up until this happened, we had 
enjoyed our cruise,” Linda Potts wrote in an 
email to The Alligator Friday. 
 The ship is currently docked in Yokoha-
ma, Japan, according to the New York Times. 
The couple receives three meals per day 
and are provided with free phone calls and in-
ternet, but Linda Potts said she is still worried 
about getting the virus. She said they were 
provided masks, rubber gloves and thermom-
eters to monitor any sickness.
Michael Terrence Potts, however, is hav-
ing a harder time since he is diabetic. The 
couple packed extra insulin that lasted until 
Sunday, and Linda Potts wrote Friday that the 
medical team was working to provide the ex-
tra medication.The couple was unsure if they will receive 
any refunds or benefits from the cruise for the 
quarantine. However, Princess Cruises wrote 
in a statement Tuesday that all guests will 
receive a full refund and 100 percent future 
cruise credit. 
The company also stated that they pro-
vided eight new satellite TV channels, more 
than 80 new video-on-demand releases, print-
ed newspapers in 36 languages, pre-printed 
trivia, daily puzzles and food and beverage 
options. 
“All I can say is being in quarantine is a 
very challenging situation,” Linda Potts wrote.

smatat@alligator.org DENISE GRIFFITHS DIED 
JAN. 29
By Chasity Maynard
Alligator Staff Writer
Shoulders and heads hung 
low. Babies cried. Their parents 
did, too. 
Feet scuffled through the 
glass doors as tears dripped past 
frowning lips. Ushers in white 
gloves followed trails of sniffs 
and moans up and down the 
aisles with boxes of white tis-
sues.
Amid the sounds of an an-
gelic gospel choir’s comforting 
lyrics, more than 300 people 
packed Passage Family Church 
Friday to mourn the loss of De-
nise Griffiths, a 21-year-old UF 
senior who died from brain and 
spinal injuries on Jan. 29, almost 
two days after she was struck by 
a car.
Friends and members from 
the UF Jamaican-American Stu-
dent Association, SISTUHS Inc. 
and a member of the organiza-
tion’s national board of directors, 
UF Black Student Union, Gator-
ship and Progressive Black Men 
Inc. sat in the outer two pews of 
the church, and family members 
crowded in the center set.
Griffiths rested at the front of 
the church in a casket hugged by 
bright flowers. A Jamaican flag 
hung next to the arrangements. 
People sitting in pews 
clutched magazine-style memo-
rial pamphlets with the headline 
“Celebration of Life.” Griffiths 
smiled on the cover next to the 
words poet, role model, activist, 
world’s greatest sister and “vot-
ed best smile.”
Members of the crowd raised 
their heads and hands in praise 
when performers and speakers 
preached of hope and remem-
brance.
During the service, Griffiths’ 
family, including her father, 
grandmother and some of her 
siblings read poems and spoke about their grief and love for her.
“Our hearts are filled with 
sadness, and our eyes are wet 
with tears. But we will remember 
you fondly and not despair. We 
will cherish the memory of your 
beautiful smile and the warmth 
of your spirit,” her father Phillip 
Griffiths said. “The love you had 
for everyone will be your legacy 
and give us the strength to carry 
on. Rest well, beautiful soul, un-
til we meet again.”
Minister Ralph McKnight, 
Griffiths’ grandfather, recalled 
his thoughts when he got to the 
hospital after Griffiths was hit, 
and how he remembers her.
“I began to wrastle with what 
was goin’ on. I said, ‘God, this is 
— this is not. I don’t understand 
this. The granddaughter’s sup-
posed to be burying the grand-
dad, not the granddad burying 
the granddaughter,’” he said in 
her eulogy.
He called for the audience to 
seek comfort in the Lord, and 
that God told him this is part of a 
bigger picture. 
“Denise said that she wanted 
to change the world, she wanted 
to impact the world,” he said. 
“So by connecting with each of 
you, look what God has done.”
Members of SISTUHS Inc. 
scooped up the flowers sur-
rounding Griffiths’ casket in arm-
fuls and surrounded the church 
at the end of the service. They 
sang songs of empowerment and 
unity before everyone exited to 
follow the funeral procession to 
the cemetery.
“She was a light to everyone 
she met,” SISTUHS member and 
UF alumna Floraldine Timoth-
ee, 21, said. “There’s a Denise-
shaped hole in every org. I just 
hope now she’s at peace and 
sees the amount of care and love 
we had for her.”

MORE THAN 200 PEOPLE 
GATHERED FOR
 THE CEREMONY 
By Irfan Kovankaya
Alligator Contributing Writer
Yvonne Hayes Hinson left 
one funeral only to find herself 
at another. 
On Friday, after laying one 
of her close friends to rest, the 
former city commissioner was 
one of more than 200 Gainesville 
residents to gather at Mount 
Pleasant United Methodist 
Church and honor the lives 
stolen by lynching in Alachua 
County nearly 100 years ago. 
Hinson’s son’s great-
grandfather was one of them, 
she said. Her son, Henry, is 
named after him.
Hinson hopes that when 
Henry learns more about his 
great-grandfather’s legacy, “it 
will not bring him pain, but 
pride,” she said. 
Somber silence interlaced 
with joyous cheers and applause 
as various speakers and 
performers took the church stage 
during the evening. Audience 
members rose to their feet, 
singing along as the 10-person choir led “Lift Every Voice and 
Sing.” The candlelit ceremony 
included prayer, reading of 
scripture, recitation of the 
victims’ names and remarks by 
family and community leaders.
This was the first time such 
an event was held in Alachua 
County, said NKwanda Jah, 
executive director of the Cultural 
Arts Coalition of Gainesville 
who helped organize the event. 
The ceremony served as a 
funeral for those who never 
received one and whose names 
were never recorded, said 
County Commissioner Charles 
Chestnut. 
Chestnut said the memorial 
was organized as part of the 
“Truth and Reconciliation 
process” to acknowledge the 
pain caused by the county’s 
racist history and begin the path 
toward recovery.
The Alachua County 
Commission began discussing 
this process back in June 
2018, aided by research from 
the Alachua County Historical 
Commission (ACHC), said 
County Commissioner Robert 
Hutchinson. Between 1867 and 
1926, more than 40 people were 
lynched in the county — the 
majority of whom were black.During the formal reading of 
the names of those lost, Patricia 
Hilliard-Nunn’s voice rang 
louder with every call of the 
phrase “unknown.” As the UF 
professor of African-American 
studies read aloud the 46 names, 
many audience members stared 
at the floor. 
Hilliard-Nunn’s reading was 
followed by a rendition of the 
song “Hell you Talmbout,” 
first performed by Janelle 
Monae. Monae’s version reads 
out the names of black people 
who died at the hands of law 
enforcement. The performance 
at the ceremony, by a group 
including singer Kali Blount, 
announced the lynching victims 
of Alachua County. 
 “You can’t honor and 
recognize people if you don’t 
call them out loud,” Blount said.
The Rev. Milford Griner, 
a local pastor, community 
leader and advocate, stressed 
the importance of not just 
remembering old mistakes but 
fighting the racism that still 
lives in our communities today. 
“As we pray, let us never 
forget all those gathered here 
whether black or white, whether 
young or old,” Griner said. 
“Never let us forget we still live in a society dogged by the evil 
monster called racism.”
Alachua County will host a 
community workshop on Feb. 
17 at the Senior Recreation 
Center, located at 5701 NW 
34th Blvd., to acknowledge the horrors of racial injustice and 
get more involved in the Truth 
and Reconciliation process, 
Chestnut said.  
“We all have a duty wherever 
we go to lift our voices and 
stand,” Griner said.

Eastside High competed to add 
a little spice to an astronaut’s 
meal in space.A team of students participat-
ed in Friday’s regional semifinals 
for the NASA Astronaut Culinary 
Challenge, which took place at 
the school. Up until mid-March, 36 nationwide teams — includ-
ing Eastside’s — will cook their 
space-ready dish in front of pan-
els of judges, vying for a plane 
ticket to Austin, Texas, for the national competition on April 15. 
The competition is under 
NASA HUNCH, a program in 
which high school students com-
pete against each other to solve 
real problems that space pro-
grams face. The winner will have 
their recipe added to the meal in-
dex that astronauts choose from 
to fuel their next interstellar voy-
age.
Eastside High was originally 
going to present its self-titled 
“Tacos In Space” dish, but the 
entrée took a quick turnaround.
Eastside culinary instructor 
Pamela Bedford said the students 
had to change their initial recipe 
to a quesadilla dish for the sake 
of practicality.
“You can’t have sauce in 
space, which is a real problem 
for tacos,” she said. “NASA also 
doesn’t like any crunchy foods 
because they create so many 
crumbs that just float around.”
Eastside High’s Institute of 
Culinary Arts program competed 
against Nature Coast Technical 
High School from Brooksville and 
International Studies Preparato-
ry Academy from Miami, which 
have all been preparing their rec-
ipes since October.
Over the span of two hours, 
the teams completed their dishes 
and served them to the judges, 
who scored the entrees on taste, texture, aroma and appearance. 
The three teams’ dishes con-
sisted of the quesadillas, a cous-
cous and pork meal and a vegan 
spinach entree, respectively.
The cook-off had a panel of 11 
judges from the American Culi-
nary Federation. During the first 
round of the competition in Octo-
ber, each team submitted an es-
say on microgravity and its own 
recipes to NASA. 
Out of this round’s 36 teams 
competing in their own regional 
semifinals, only 10 will advance 
to the national competition, said 
Jacqui Pressinger, organizer of 
the cook-off and the director of 
strategic partnerships of the culi-
nary federation.
The competition was signifi-
cant in regards to societal chang-
es that will impact the future of 
space travel, said Darin Nine, a 
judge of the competition and culi-
nary instructor at Marion Techni-
cal College.
“We have to start thinking 
what [food] we’re going to start 
sending with colonists to Mars 
— that’s a one-way trip,” Nine 
said. “Astronauts used to only be 
middle-aged males and the trend 
is now shifting to young females, 
and nutrition needs to change 
with that.”Alachua County honors lynching victims nearly 100 years later

• Next time you're in Iowa, you might want to stop by the rural town of Riverside, 
which touts itself as the future birthplace of Captain James T. Kirk. Yep, the 
future  birthplace. It seems that "Star Trek" creator Gene Roddenberry asserted 
that the character of James Tiberius Kirk was born in Iowa, but he didn't specify 
exactly where. In 1985, the Riverside City Council voted to declare their town the 
future birthplace of the character, later writing to Roddenberry and receiving 
his approval. In honor of its newfound claim to fame, the city began hosting an 
annual Trek Fest, complete with a Spockapalooza battle of the bands.
• The term "bric-a-brac," usually used to refer to a collection of tawdry trinkets, comes 
from the French, where its original meaning was "at random."
• Most parents of small children know that trampolines can be dangerous, and they 
are. Every year, nearly 100,000 people receive emergency-room treatment for 
injuries sustained while using trampolines. Those injuries are hardly ever fatal, 
though. Pools, on the other hand, are far more deadly; more than 1,000 people in 
the United States die in swimming pools annually.

If the USF-Rawlings Invitational 
were a rollercoaster, Saturday would 
have been the sudden, heart-wrench-
ing drop for the Gators.
Friday night’s win over Illinois 
State (4-1) moved Florida up the 
track. On its way to the top, the Gators 
narrowly escaped Fresno State (6-4), 
inching further along. They paused at 
the top to take in the view before fac-
ing their ﬁ  rst ranked opponent in No. 
17 Michigan.
After one inning turned out a ﬁ  ve-
run deﬁ  cit for Florida, the Gators ex-
perienced the drop of a lifetime. 
Following an embarrassing 11-2 
defeat at the hands of the Wolver-
ines and three errors on Saturday, 
the Gators (4-1) needed a conﬁ  dence 
boost in the form of a convincing 10-0 
win over Georgia State (1-3) and a 6-1 
victory over USF (0-4).
Senior power hitter Jordan Rob-
erts and freshman Baylee Goddard 
helped accomplished just that.
Florida made its way back up the track with a win over Georgia State in 
ﬁ  ve innings via run rule, 10-0.
After an 0 for 4 start to the week-
end, Roberts’ ﬁ  rst two hits of the 
game were homers. In the top of the 
fourth, she sent the ball sailing over 
the left-centerﬁ  eld wall to put UF up 
2-0. In the top of the ﬁ  fth, she drove 
sophomore Charla Echols home, ex-
tending the Gators’ lead to 7-0.
Later in the inning, Goddard hit a 
three-RBI home run, allowing redshirt 
senior Sophia Reynoso and freshman 
E.C. Taylor to score. 
Five runs in the ﬁ  fth. Just like that, 
it was 10-0, Florida.
In her second college game, UF 
freshman Rylee Trlicek threw a no-
hitter. After allowing three runs to 
Fresno State on Saturday, Trlicek had 
six strikeouts and, aside from a line 
drive, limited the Panthers’ hits to 
weak grounders, three of which she 
turned into outs herself.
Against the reigning AAC cham-
pion USF, junior Natalie Lugo, senior 
Katie Chronister and Trlicek stepped 
into the circle for the Gators and led 
the team to a 6-1 win over the Bulls. On Saturday, Michigan earned 
four runs off Lugo. But on Sunday, 
she allowed only one. Chronister took 
over and threw one pitch that resulted 
in a walk with two outs in the bottom 
of the sixth. Trlicek relieved Chronis-
ter to end the inning with a pop out, 
and she wrap up the seventh.
Against All-American pitcher 
Georgina Corrick, junior Jordan Mat-
thews and senior Jade Caraway each 
managed an RBI single in the ﬁ  rst 
and second innings, respectively, put-
ting the Gators ahead 2-0. Roberts 
smacked her third home run of the 
day in the top of the ﬁ  fth against the 
Bulls, extending Florida’s lead to 4-0. 
She had nine over the course of the 
2019 season. Echols, who coach Tim 
Walton compared to Amanda Lorenz 
throughout the offseason, wrapped 
up the game with a two-RBI homer 
of her own in the top of the seventh, 
driving senior Kendyl Lindaman 
home and putting USF away, 6-1.
Opening weekend brought high 
highs and early lows for the Gators. 
Surely, Walton and the rest of the 
program would like to see more con-sistency out of the young squad as the 
season progresses, but the USF-Raw-
lings Invitational was still a thrilling 
ride nonetheless.
Next up for UF is an exhibition 
game against Team USA at Katie Sea-
shole Pressly Stadium Tuesday night. Three former Gators, Michelle Moult-
rie, Kelsey Stewart and Aubree Mun-
ro, will return to Gainesville wearing 
red and white instead of orange with 
their blue.

SOFTBALL
WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
By Graham Marsh
Sports Writer
In college basketball, 
one week is a long time. 
Florida dropped a 
heartbreaker to Georgia 
(13-11, 4-7 SEC) by a 
score of 49-43 despite 
coming off of its big-
gest win of the year last 
week against Kentucky. 
It was Florida’s second-
lowest scoring total of 
the season on Saturday 
at the O’Connell Cen-
ter. Foul trouble, lack of 
shooting and turnovers 
did the Gators in. 
Three things above 
all else cost UF (12-11, 
3-7 SEC) in this one: 
turnovers, poor scoring 
efforts from guards Lav-
ender Briggs and Kiara 
Smith and foul trouble 
for forward Zada Wil-
liams. 
Briggs and Smith 
ﬁ  nished the game com-
bining for just 10 points 
despite averaging a 
combined 26.7 points 
per game heading into 
this matchup. And it was not for lack of try-
ing, as Briggs took 14 
shots while Smith took 
10. 
They simply weren’t 
falling. 
Smith hit one ﬁ  eld 
goal all day, a transition 
layup off of a steal late 
in the fourth quarter. 
Briggs made just three 
of her attempts to ﬁ  nish 
the game at just 21-per-
cent shooting. 
“I do think at times 
they forced some tough-
er shots than they had 
at ﬁ  rst,” coach Cam 
Newbauer said. “That’s 
what you can do when 
you press a little bit, 
those are two players 
that we rely on a lot to 
do a lot.”
Turnovers were also 
a killer for Newbauer’s 
team all day. Florida 
turned the ball over 20 
times, just ﬁ  ve more 
than UGA’s 15, but it 
was the untimeliness of 
them. In the midst of a 
comeback attempt, UF 
turned it over twice in 
the ﬁ  nal few minutes, making its degree of dif-
ﬁ  culty to claw back into 
the game much harder. 
But above all else, 
the Achilles’ heel of the 
day for Florida was Wil-
liams getting her fourth 
foul. The redshirt senior 
was having an effec-
tive game scoring the 
basketball, accounting 
for 13 points on 6-for-
9 shooting. But in the 
middle of the third quar-
ter, she picked up her 
fourth foul. Newbauer 
was forced to bench her 
until midway through 
the fourth, and that 
stretch cost the Gators.
“We probably waited 
too long to put her in,” 
Newbauer said. “By the 
time we put her back in 
we were down eight.” 
Williams, along with 
the rest of UF’s for-
wards, had an incred-
ibly tough assignment 
all day defending Geor-
gia forward Jenna Staiti. 
The 6-foot-4 transfer 
from Maryland was a 
force for the Bulldogs all 
game, scoring 19 points on 50-percent shooting. 
She was the main rea-
son for Williams’ foul 
issues.
“(Staiti’s) really 
strong and she posts 
really deep,” Williams 
said. “She kind of puts 
you in a position where 
it’s like, ‘Either I get re-
ally aggressive or just 
let her score.’”
Florida’s three down-
falls, along with Staiti’s 
standout performance, 
were the main culprits 
for UGA’s six-point 
victory. UF’s program-
building victory over 
then-No. 13 Kentucky 
last Sunday now feels 
like a distant memory. 
“I thought that we 
had gotten over the 
hump with our tough-
ness,” Newbauer 
said. “That third and 
fourth quarter was just 
strange, our energy was 
just strange, man.”
@GrahamMarshUF
gmarsh@alligator.orgRollercoaster opening weekend ends with four wins for Florida
UF folds late, loses to Georgia at home
Mediocrity  
has long 
plagued  
this basket-
ball team 
and there does not 
seem to be a cure.
Maybe mediocrity 
isn’t the right word. 
That would insinuate 
this squad is consis-
tently a .500 team.
Fans, media members and 
spectators are now coming to re-
alize the chances of a great win 
or a horrendous loss for UF is as 
likely as a coin landing on heads.
There are days like the 81-75 
win against Georgia last week 
where UF stormed back from 22 
points down to defeat a now 12-
11 squad. Then there are days 
like Saturday.
Florida’s latest loss, this time 
at the hands of an average Ole 
Miss team, drops Florida’s record 
to 14-9 and an abysmal 2-5 on the 
road.
This was supposed to be the 
easy part of Florida’s schedule 
before the Gators battle with some of the top teams 
in the SEC and even-
tually the postseason. 
Now, it is becoming 
clearer that there’s 
no remedy for the lit-
any of game-to-game 
problems this team 
has.
The Gators haven’t 
had much to hang 
their hat on as of late, but one 
thing they have been able to take 
care of is the ball. UF only has 
a 17.5 percent turnover percent-
age, according to KenPom, good 
enough for third in the SEC.
Yet Florida coughed up the 
rock 15 times in Oxford, Mis-
sissippi, on Saturday. Recently, 
coach Mike White has preached 
that his team’s offense has great-
ly improved while its defense has 
regressed significantly.
That wasn’t the case when UF 
shot just 33 percent from the field 
against Ole Miss and allowed 
three Rebel players to reach dou-
ble digits.

GYMNASTICS
LACROSSEBy Noah Ram

Dominant.
That would be the word to describe the 
Florida Gymnastics team this season.
Friday night’s win against No. 4 Denver and No. 18 Iowa State in the Gators’ first tri-
meet since 2012 reinforced that notion.
Denver scored its second-highest point total 
Friday night and still lost to the No. 2 Gators by 
more than half a point.
The Cyclones put up a season-high 196.8 
score against UF and yet lost by over a point.
That is the sign of a team that is mowing 
down opponents every week.
Every win this season has been by at least 
0.6 points, which is substantial in gymnastics.
Florida has scored at least 197.35 points in 
each meet this season; it only did that six times 
in 2019.
The only meet where that didn’t happen 
this season was its lackluster performance 
against Missouri on Jan. 17. That being said, 
it still beat the then-No. 19 Tigers by over a 
point.
Three of the five highest scores in the na-
tion this season have been courtesy of the or-
ange and blue, including the top score, 198.375 
against LSU on Jan. 24.
That score against the Tigers was third-
highest in program history, and the highest 
since the team’s national championship-win-ning 2015 squad and the highest of coach Jen-
ny Rowland’s career.
UF is off to a 6-0 start this season, with all 
six wins coming against teams ranked in the 
Road to Nationals top 20 at the time of the 
meet.
That start is the Gators’ best since 2014 
when they started 7-0 en route to their second 
national championship.
The focal point of the team’s success has 
been Trinity Thomas, who is competing for a 
spot on the U.S. National Team for this sum-
mer’s Tokyo Olympics.
“She’s just really been settling in and tak-
ing ownership of her gymnastics,” Rowland 
said before the tri-meet. “She’s a lot more con-
fident in what she’s doing (compared to last 
season).”
That confidence is showing, especially 
when she performs at the O’Connell Center, 
where she has almost become a living, breath-
ing perfect score.
The last two home meets the sophomore 
has scored a 10. Three weeks ago, it was on 
the bars, and last week, it was on the beam.
It’s hard to find one exercise where she is lacking, which explains why she has gotten the 
all-around spot in every meet this season.
In three of the five meets this season, her 
scores in all four rotations have been at least a 
9.90 and her all-around score has been at least 
39.7 in four meets.
But of course, it takes more than just one 
athlete to make a team and Florida’s depth is a 
massive reason why the team has reigned su-
preme over the gymnastics’ world.
From freshman Payton Richards to senior 
Rachel Gowey, every Gator who has stepped 
into the lineup has excelled and that has given 
Rowland the flexibility to mess with lineups a 
little bit.
This past meet, senior Sierra Alexander was 
benched in favor of junior Jazmyn Foberg. Fo-
berg, who was returning from injury, scored 
a 9.825 in her return, the team’s third-highest 
score in that exercise.
“This team should feel great about them-
selves,” Rowland said following last week’s 
meet. “You are going to have mistakes, but it’s 
about that next person stopping that trend and 
stepping up and doing what they need to do.”

Shannon Kavanagh made an attempt to drive towards Colo-
rado goalkeeper, Julia Lisella. Tied at 1-1, with roughly 20 min-
utes remaining in the game’s first half, Florida’s junior midfield-
er was looking to give her team its first lead of the game. 
She composed herself for the shot and scored. The 545 Gators 
fans that packed the seats of Dizney Stadium erupted in unison. 
But in a split second, celebrations were replaced by confusion. 
No goal. 
Instead, the preseason All-American midfielder drew a yel-
low card for a reason unbeknownst to everyone. 
“I’d rather have them out there making mistakes than not 
taking those opportunities,” coach Amanda O’Leary said. 
During No. 14 Florida’s over three-hour, 11-10 win over No. 
18 Colorado, 39 fouls and seven yellow cards were given while 
both sides combined for 45 shots on goal. 
For the fans, what was first an enjoyable outing in sunny, 
68-degree weather became emotional torture. 
Colorado’s largest lead of three goals happened in the first 
half and lasted 40 seconds. In the second, Florida fell behind two 
goals for nearly three minutes. The game was tied five times. 
Each score, every tiebreaker and all 13 fouls called that were 
in favor of the Centennial State vacuumed the sounds of Gators 
support, replacing them with murmurs of frustration. 
But Florida prevailed. 
“We would get three goals, they would get three goals; we 
would get one goal they would get they would answer back,” 
O’Leary said. “We didn’t give up.”
The Gators’ spirit became contagious with each passing mo-ment. With each goal, fans found life, and with each uncalled 
foul, they grew restless. 
But the effects of the team’s energy were more noticeable on 
the field. Florida lost ten seniors to graduation last spring. They 
were replaced by 14 freshmen whose nervousness was quickly 
replaced by confident play. 
“They were like deer in headlights,” O’Leary said. “Once they 
stepped out on the field, and they got some plays under their 
belt, I thought they did a fantastic job.”
Florida’s foundation for success started with the veterans. 
Seven of the eight caused turnovers were produced by upper-
classmen, while Kavanagh and junior midfielder Brianna Harris 
maintained the team’s offense, combining for nine goals. 
And through the confidence imbued by their experienced 
teammates, the freshmen flourished. Attacker Kaala Puglisi re-
corded two assists and ground balls in her first collegiate game, 
but Emily Heller stole the show. 
With 8:31 remaining in the game, Colorado’s Zoe Lawless 
scored a third time, tying the game at ten. With 3:40 left in the 
game, Kavanagh found the back of the net for her fourth, and 
the game’s final score. 
Then the freshman midfielder took over. She won the first 
draw, giving Florida 90 more seconds to ice its lead. Two fouls 
later, and with less than a minute left, a Kavanagh turnover gave 
the Buffaloes possession of the ball and a chance to force over-
time. 
They patiently passed from player to player, hoping Flori-
da’s zone defense would break. The crowd was speechless as it 
hoped the worst-case scenario  wouldn’t occur. 
With ten seconds left, a safe pass to Colorado’s sophomore 
midfielder Bailey Hawkins caught Heller’s attention. She lunged to make a deflection, succeeding and quickly snatching the 
ground ball, stealing all hope from the Buffaloes. 
In her first game, Heller had two goals, one assist and per-
formed the most crucial play of the game. 
Her heroics ended the fans’ anxiety, and what ensued was a 
deafening roar.

Coming off of a dominating per-
formance by Florida’s sprinting 
corps last week at the Razorback 
Invitational, the distance runners 
made their mark by breaking several 
personal records and earning a few 
nationally ranked times 
The Gators competed on Friday 
and Saturday in the Camel City In-
vitational in Winston-Salem, North 
Carolina, as 33 runners made the trip 
up north to take part. 
UF’s standout performance came 
from 800 meter runner Justin Paci-fico. While his fourth-place finish 
may not seem particularly outstand-
ing, it is important to note that the 
senior finished first among colle-
giate runners. The quality of the top 
three runners is outstanding, as first, 
second and third were taken by an 
Olympic bronze medalist, a first-
team All-American, and a USATF  
Champion respectively. More im-
pressively, his 1:49.51 time broke his 
previous personal record and placed 
him in sixth nationally among 800m 
runners. 
The Gators continued to impress 
in the 800 meter, as junior Abbie 
Harrelson finished second among collegiate runners with a 2:08.49. 
This time broke her indoor personal 
record and elevated the two-time All-
SEC selection into the national con-
versation, now ranking 17th in the 
800m.
Junior Colin Schaefer and sopho-
more Nick Deal both impressed for 
Florida in the 5,000 meters, coming 
in second and third, respectively. 
Deal’s 14:33.51 time was less than 
five seconds short of his teammate’s 
and served as a new indoor personal 
record for the St. Johns native. 
A duo of Aussies, sophomore 
Imogen Barrett and senior Caitlin 
McQuilkin-Bell, added to a growing list of impressive performances from 
UF’s international contingent this 
past weekend. The sophomore broke 
her personal record in the mile with 
a 4:46.15 time, good for a 10th place 
finish. Bell broke her personal record 
as well, finishing with a 17:07.08 
time in the 5,000 meters that led her 
to a strong third-place finish. 
In the first 1,000 meter race of 
his career, freshman Hugh Britten-
ham impressed with a 2:30.41 time. 
This finish resulted in a second-place 
finish among collegiate participants 
and a first-place among Division 1 
runners. 
Other athletes of note are fresh-man Jackie Addy and junior Dominic 
Williams. Both runners broke their 
personal records over the weekend, 
with Addy scoring a 5:07.19 in the 
women’s mile and Williams earn-
ing a 9.09.55 time in the men’s 3000 
meters. 
The Gators will return to Clem-
son University for the second time 
next weekend to take part in the Ti-
ger Paw Invitational and will have 
eyes on the quickly approaching SEC 
Championships, scheduled for Feb. 
28 and 29 in College Station, Texas.

MEN'S TENNISBy Ainslie Lee

Over the course of three days, 
select athletes from Florida’s 
men’s and women’s swimming 
and diving teams made their way 
to Auburn, Alabama, to compete 
in Auburn’s Last Chance Invita-
tional. The event, which had no 
team scoring, provided an addi-
tional opportunity for competitors 
to post qualifying times for a wide 
slate of events. 
Florida’s No. 9-ranked men’s 
team had eight members spend 
the weekend in Alabama, while 
11 members of the No. 8-ranked 
women’s team competed as well. 
Day 1: Friday
Posting a B-cut time in the 500 free, freshman Alfonso Mestre 
posted a time of 4:21.96, five sec-
onds faster than his prelim swim 
that morning. 
Fellow freshman Ethan Mc-
Cloud was the only Gator to com-
pete in the 200 individual medley. 
McCloud nabbed a third-place fin-
ish in the event and posted a new 
personal-best time of 1:49.80.
For the women, heading into 
the 500 free with the best prelim 
time of 4:56.67, junior Bettina Bo-
szormenyi touched the wall sec-
ond in the event. 
Later, the 200 individual med-
ley finals saw a Gator-heavy line-
up. The event featured four swim-
mers representing the orange and 
blue. Junior Adrianna DeBoer 
posted a personal-best time of 
2:02.89, good for a third-place finish. Sophomore Ellie Zweifel 
also swam a personal-best with a 
time of 2:04.41 and a sixth-place 
finish. 
Day 2: Saturday 
A tight race between two of 
Florida’s men in the 400 IM high-
lighted Saturday’s action for the 
Gators. 
Freshmen Tyler Watson and 
Brennan Gravely both posted 
personal-bests in the 400 IM with 
times of 3:52.63 and 3:53.54, re-
spectively. 
For the women, Florida had 
three top finishers. 
Sophomore Celi Guzman won 
the 100 fly after posting a per-
sonal-best 53.97. Senior Kelsey 
Dambacher touched the wall in 
1:48.52 in her season-best swim in the 200 free. DeBoer also found 
a top swim and season-best in the 
100 breast with a time of 1:02.11.
Day 3: Sunday
To round out the weekend, 
three of Florida’s men tallied in-
dividual wins on Sunday, all good 
for B-cuts. 
For the first time this season, 
Brennan Gravely swam the 1,650 
free distance and beat the field by 
nearly seven seconds with a time 
of 15:08.68. McCloud also picked 
up a personal-best swim in the 
200 back with a time of 1:46.23. 
Rounding out the freshman 
trio, Tyler Watson found his sec-
ond victory of the weekend with a 
personal-best swim in the 200 fly 
with a time of 1:46.93.
Celi Guzman and Ellie Zwe-ifel shined for the women on day 
three. 
Guzman secured her second 
win of the weekend in the 200 
back. Her time of 1:57.00 in the fi-
nals won the field but her 1:56.42 
posting in the prelims was a per-
sonal-best for the sophomore. 
Meanwhile, with a lifetime-
best swim, Zweifel won her first 
event of the invitational with a 
2:17.17 in the 200 breast. 
What’s next:
Both Gator teams will compete 
at the James E. Martin Aquatic 
Center in Auburn, Alabama, as 
they enter the postseason with 
the SEC Championships on Feb. 
18-22. 
@AinsliesTwoBits
alee@alligator.orgSeveral Gators pick up season-best times at Auburn
they typically leave inconsisten-
cy in their wake. Florida is now 
3-4 in its last seven with each 
game different from the last.
The truth of the matter is 
there is a tendency for anyone 
who follows this team to expect 
this. Whether it’s a drubbing of 
then-No. 4 Auburn or the biggest 
comeback of the season against 
Georgia, you know the lows have 
to come with the highs.
White sees this trend as 
well. The fifth-year coach has 
held more media availabilities 
scratching his head and calling 
out his team than he would like. 
“As I talked about after our 
last game against Georgia: ‘Great 
comeback! Great win! But why 
are we down 22, if you’re a high-
level team?’” White said in a re-
lease. “You can feel good about the result, but not about the way 
you played for 40 (minutes).”
It’s not a Florida basketball 
press conference without White 
being blunt with his opinion on 
his team.
White has called the Gators 
soft, the worst defensive team he 
has ever coached and more, so 
far this season and, come Mon-
day, I’m sure he’ll have plenty to 
say after UF’s worst road loss of 
the season.
The ailments are substantial 
with Florida’s sickness. Lack of 
shooting, defense, maturity, or 
accountability take your pick.
If this trend continues and no 
cure is found, this team won’t 
live to see March.COLUMN,  from pg. 9UF is 2-5 in away gamesSWIMMING

Purdue made the Gators earn their 
doubles point on Sunday morning.
On Courts 1 and 2, Florida was in the 
midst of a tiebreaker. Josh Goodger and 
Duarte Vale found themselves trailing 
halfway through the match on Court 3. 
Goodger and Vale stormed back to win 
the first match in doubles. Then, UF had 
to win just one tiebreaker to clinch the 
doubles point. 
Oliver Crawford and Sam Riffice 
went back and forth with Athell Bennett 
and Julian Saborio on Court 1 in their 
tiebreaker. Will Grant and Johannes 
Ingildsen sealed the doubles victory on 
Court 2 and prevented UF from dropping 
its first doubles point this season.The No. 3 Gators (9-1) cruised through 
singles play after a nerve-wracking 
doubles finish to take the 6-1 victory 
over the Boilermakers (6-4) on Sunday 
morning at the Schwartz Tennis Center in 
West Lafayette, Indiana.
In doubles, juniors Goodger and Vale 
knocked off Sebastian Welch and Tomasz 
Dudek 6-4. No. 24 senior Ingildsen and 
Grant, a freshman, beat Michal Wozniak 
and Mateo Julio 7-5 in the tiebreaker to 
win doubles 7-6. 
Florida headed into singles play with 
a 1-0 advantage for the 10th time this 
season. 
Coach Bryan Shelton refreshed his 
lineup against Purdue. He elected to sit 
junior Crawford and Ingildsen to improve 
his team’s depth. In their place, he 
substituted Goodger and No. 112 freshman Blaise Bicknell. 
“We’re deep,” Shelton 
said after his team defeated 
USF on Jan. 26. “We got 12 
guys on this team, and I feel comfortable 
putting a lot of them out there in big-time 
situations for us.”
Against Purdue, UF’s bench showed 
Shelton that it could be trusted when 
called upon.
Goodger was placed on Court 4 and 
beat Maksymillian Raupuk in straight 
sets 6-4, 6-4. Next, Bicknell topped Julian 
Saborio 6-2, 6-1 on Court 6.
No. 11 Vale finished first in singles, 
winning 6-2, 6-1 on Court 2 over Julio.
After Bicknell finished second, junior 
Andy Andrade prevailed over Wozniak 
6-3, 6-4 on Court 3 to give the Gators the 
4-0 lead.
Purdue broke up the shutout when No. 
30 Bennett came out on top in the third set 
over No. 4 Riffice 2-6, 7-5, 10-8 on Court 1. 
Finally, No. 90 Lukas Greif trounced 
Welch 6-2, 6-2 to bring the final score to 
6-1. 
Florida returns to action this weekend 
when it takes part in the Intercollegiate 
Tennis Association National Team Indoors 
Championships in Madison, Wisconsin.
“Our team competed very well this 
weekend,” Shelton said in a release. 
“Purdue applied a lot of pressure in 
the doubles and we answered the 
questions they posed very well today. 
Our competitive spirit was really good. 
We didn’t always play our best tennis 
throughout the weekend, but we are 
learning more about ourselves and we will 
continue to improve.”
