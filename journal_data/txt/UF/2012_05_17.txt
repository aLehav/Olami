ATRIUM AND LOBBY DESIGNS.

UF&Shands Health System and the UF 
Academic Health Center have committed to 
creating a new entry pavilion and lobby for the Shands Hospital for Children.
According to David Guzick, UF senior 
vice president for health affairs and president of UF&Shands Health System, these plans for construction will be the hospital’s fundrais-ing project for the upcoming year.
“We’re currently viewing federal design 
concepts for a two-story atrium leading into a dedicated lobby area for the children’s hos-pital,” Guzick said during a press conference Wednesday.
The new additions to the hospital, which 
include the lobby, a children’s atrium, an en-trance pavilion and a themed donor wall, will be located near the east parking garage. Guz-ick said the gift shop and the bathrooms in the current entrance will be demolished and rebuilt in a different spot to create a much more generous lobby.
Guzick said he hopes the exterior of the 
lobby and the two-story pavillion will gener -
ate interest among a variety of artists. He said he wants to find the best way to represent the children’s hospital.

The Gainesville City Commission’s stance against the sale 
of candy-flavored tobacco products will officially go on the re-
cord with the passing of a new resolution Thursday.
The City Commission’s resolution urges vendors around 
the city to stop selling and marketing flavored tobacco as a way to reduce exposure of the products to children and young adults.
Andrew Romero, a tobacco prevention specialist at the Ala-
chua County Health Department, said Gainesville High School students from Students Working Against Tobacco originally brought the issue to light during a citizen’s comment meeting on Dec. 15.
The city commission decided to conduct its own research on the issue and heard from experts that the products were being marketed to youths using flavoring, he said.
Gainesville City Spokesman Bob Woods said the city is cur -
rently not considering a ban, but the resolution will be a way to raise awareness about the flavored tobacco issue.
Romero said research studies cited by the Food and Drug 
Administration have shown children and teenagers are more City Commission discourages sale of flavored tobacco

UF’s anti-hazing task force has found stu-
dents may not be clear on a definition of haz-
ing, and administrators aren’t clear on their responsibility to Santa Fe College and non-degree seeking students on campus.
During a meeting of the anti-hazing task 
force Wednesday, administrators discussed potential conflicts with Santa Fe College and dual enrollment students who may participate in UF’s marching band, ROTC and other cam-pus organizations.
Though the UF Student Code of Conduct 
applies to these students, there is a gray area as to how UF can deal with them if they are involved in an incident, said Jack Causseaux, associate director of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs.
“Maybe that’s something we need to clarify in the [anti-hazing] policy ,” 
Bernard Mair, associate provost of undergraduate affairs, said.
UF also needs to expand 
the presence of its anti-
hazing policy to make sure students understand what hazing is, Causseaux said.
Students know the hazing cases that make it into the news are wrong, he said, but they 
may not define more minor incidents as haz-ing.
However, administrators agreed UF’s anti-
hazing policy doesn’t need to change.
“My sense is the policy isn’t our chal-
lenge,” said Chris Loschiavo, assistant dean of students and director of student conduct and conflict resolution.

Horse runs into sea, rescued a 
mile offshore
CARPINTERIA, Calif. (AP) 
— Maybe he should be named 
Bob.
An Arabian horse named 
William got spooked during a California beachside photo shoot Tuesday and swam a mile out to sea before rescuers got to him and helped him back to shore.
Carpinteria-Summerland 
Fire Capt. Jay Irwin tells the Santa Barbara News-Press that the horse’s white head looked like a seagull bobbing in the water.
Owner Mindy Peters says the 
6-year-old Arabian, whose offi-cial name is Heir of Temptation, was part of a photo clinic on the beach when it was spooked by waves and ran off.
Rescue swimmers assisted 
by the Santa Barbara Harbor Patrol and state parks employ-ees found the horse a mile off-shore as darkness fell.
By 8:30 p.m., the horse was 
back on shore in good shape.

Workers go trash-picking for 
Mass. woman’s rings
ATTLEBORO, Mass. (AP) — 
An Attleboro, Mass., woman is 
praising the city’s trash collec-tion company after its workers helped her dig through moun-tains of stinking garbage to find five valuable rings she inadver -
tently threw away, including her engagement and wedding bands.
Deb Kirby says she took the 
rings off one day last week to dry them after washing her hands. She tells The Sun Chron-icle she wrapped them in a pa-per towel, got distracted and tossed them.
Distraught, she called Waste from Asia to Prince Rupert, British Columbia.

Man freed on bond but must 
write book reports
RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) — 
A man charged in an undercov-
er sting operation in Northern California that ended in gunfire has been ordered released on bond on the condition that he read and write book reports.
U.S. District Judge Yvonne 
Gonzalez Rogers allowed 23-year-old Otis Mobley to be freed Monday, although she delayed an order to allow prosecutors to appeal her decision.
The San Francisco Chronicle 
reports that under the bond or -
der, Mobley would be required to spend an hour reading and a half hour writing each day as he awaits trial on robbery and as-sault charges.
Mobley and two others are 
accused of arranging to sell a grenade launcher for $1,000 to an undercover federal agent in Richmond, Calif.

Dozens of flyswatters wash 
up on Alaska beaches
KODIAK, Alaska (AP) — 
Dozens of fly swatters bearing 
logos of collegiate and profes-sional sports teams have been washing up on the beaches of an Alaska island.
The fly swatters found on 
Kodiak were believed to be debris from last year’s Japa-nese earthquake and tsunami, but the Kodiak Daily Mirror reports that they are from a shipping container that went overboard almost four months ago.
Team Sports America re-
ceived word that the con-tainer ship carrying its prod-ucts from China lost several shipping containers after a rogue wave hit the vessel in a storm.
A cable on the ship broke, 
and a whole row of contain-ers got loose in the Pacific Ocean.
It is likely the containers 
were on the Cosco Yokohama, a container vessel traveling THUNDER

likely to use candy- and fruit-flavored 
tobacco products than adults.
“One in six youths between the ages 
of 11 and 17 has tried flavored tobacco here in Alachua County,” he said. “That’s roughly 2,300 Alachua County public school youths.”
In 2009, the FDA banned the sale of 
flavored cigarettes nationwide. The law does not currently apply to other fla-vored tobacco products, including dip-ping tobacco, cigarillos and smokeless tobacco.
Some cities have taken steps to ban 
the sale of the flavored products.
On Tuesday, the Miami-Dade Coun-
ty Commission preliminarily approved a ban on the sale of flavored tobacco in a 12-1 vote. Miami now joins New York City , Providence, R.I., Santa Clara, Calif., and other cities that currently ban fla-vored tobacco product sales.
Jason Lee, 27, general manager of the 
Land B4 Time Smoke Shop, said he dis-agrees with the city commission urging 
vendors to stop fla-vored tobacco sales.
Lee said the major -
ity of his store’s sales come from flavored tobacco.
He said he prevents 
underage children from buying his prod-ucts by only allowing 
people 18 years or older in the store.
“There is no way kids are getting into 
my shop without an ID,” he said.
Several gas stations along Archer 
Road declined to comment.FEATURE

Home is where the heart is, but for Jennifer Smith, it’s a 
place where she can fix the broken.
For a house meant to assist drug addicts, criminals and the 
unlucky, the inside never looked so comforting.
An afternoon breeze wafted through an open window as 
Smith, 41, sat cross-legged on a couch with her eyes fixed on 
the empty street outside.
The window shook and the walls vibrated as a car blasting 
its stereo zipped past the house on East University Avenue.
Smith cracked a smile as the thumping faded.“We get a whole orchestra of those during the night,” she 
said. “But I’ve gotten used to it.”Smith is the director of the House of Hope of Alachua Coun-
ty women’s program. She has been living in the new women’s house since it reopened in March.
Nancy Cuddington, 54, of Interlachen, Fla., moved into the 
house with Smith on April 14.
A felony DUI charge has hindered Cuddington from get-
ting a job since being released from prison in January, but it didn’t stop her from getting first pick for the bed she will be sleeping in for the next six months.
The House of Hope was established in 1995 to mentor newly 
freed prisoners in a Christian influenced, six-month program.
The organization did not establish a women’s program until 
several years later, Smith said.
Each section’s director lives among the ex-prisoners as both 
a teacher and housemate. Volunteers assist the directors in or -
ganizing and teaching classes.
Smith was named the director of the House of Hope wom-
en’s section in September. The women’s section reopened in March after a two-year closure.
Smith’s passion to help others in need is rooted in her past 
life of homelessness and drug addiction.
“It started with me as a teenager,” she said.Born in Trenton, Fla., in June 1970, Smith trekked down the 
path of drug abuse by starting a habit of smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol when she was 11 years old.
At 14, Smith experimented with harder drugs: LSD, cocaine, 
speed and “everything I could get my hands on,” she said.
By the time she was 23, Smith was a twice-divorced, single 
mother deep into drugs.
At one point, she gave up the one thing she loved the most 
in order to keep up with her habits.
“The drugs made me abandon my son,” she said.From 1993 to 2001, Smith lived homeless in Gainesville 
while spending time in and out of courtrooms for fraud, prosti-tution and drug possession charges, according to records from the Alachua County Clerk of Courts.
But she never lost the will to help others. If money was avail-
able, she rented hotel rooms to give prostitutes places to sleep.
“I’ve always had that nursing heart to make other people 
feel good about themselves,” she said.
Even as Smith tried to help others in need, she could not 
escape the reality of her ongoing struggle with homelessness and drug addiction.
It caught up with her at 31 years old. Smith suffered from 
hallucinations and paranoia while on the run from the police.
“I was scared of people,” she said. “I thought everyone was 
in this massive conspiracy to get me and to kill me.”
On Nov. 4, 2001, Smith hit rock bottom.To hide from her fears, Smith walked to the house of a man 
who was supporting her and locked herself in a closet.
Inside the enclosed space, Smith questioned God’s existence 
and believed death would be the best way to end her pain. As the darkness swallowed her, she lost consciousness.When Smith awoke the following morning, she walked 
back to Gainesville with a new goal: to get better.
Smith spent the next two weeks enrolling in drug rehabilita-
tion programs but left because she did not find peace in them.
She found it after walking into the First Assembly of God 
church ministry. It inspired a revelation in Smith, and she real-ized she needed to turn herself in to the authorities, she said.
“I was always the ‘Catch-me-if-you-can kind of person,” 
she said. “But I turned myself in, and it felt like this massive freedom.”
She immersed herself in Christianity to distance herself from 
the past. She read the Bible and attended church regularly.
She found a job at Home Depot while volunteering at First 
Assembly of God on the side.  
With her time volunteering at the church, Smith said she 
wanted to help alcoholics, drug addicts and broken women.
In October 2009, Smith seized her chance when she became 
the head of the Downtown Ministries.
As part of an organization that she said provides 300 meals 
a week to homeless people in Gainesville, she wanted to make sure every hungry person went to bed with a full stomach.
“I have a heart for hungry people,” she said. “I believe no 
one should go hungry.”
Smith’s work at the Downtown Ministries caught the at-
tention of House of Hope Men’s Director Tom Bakos. He of-fered her the job as the new women’s director for the House of Hope.
“I pursued her for over a year,” he said.She accepted.As director, Smith planned to reopen the women’s section 
with the construction of a new women’s house. 
But building stopped in December due to disagreements 
with the landowner’s contract, Smith said.
On Jan. 12, the House of Hope board of directors agreed to 
allow the women’s section to occupy one of the men’s houses on East University Avenue. The board agreed to reopen the house in March.
For the next two months, Smith interviewed female prison-
ers at the Lowell Correctional Institution in Ocala.
During the interviews, Smith told stories about her drug 
addiction, living on the streets and reconnecting with her son, Christopher, now 21.
“If I didn’t have that restoration to him, I wouldn’t be able 
to speak hope into these women coming out who lost their kids,” she said. “But I’ve gone through that, and I know it can be done. As bad as it was, it can be done. It is a process.”
The women’s house officially reopened on March 1.Smith continues to live with Cuddington in the house and 
will begin the mentoring program when more women move in this summer.
Back in the living room, Smith pointed out two small bullet 
holes in the window.
She said the house is near where she used to do drugs, but 
the holes aren’t scaring her away.
“They are constant reminders of the world we live in,” 
she said. “When you commit to this ministry , bullet holes are meaningless.”Formerly homeless woman gives hope to others in need4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MAY 17, 2012

CiTy, from page 1Miami moving toward banFundraiser will focus on project
According to Guzick, the project is estimat-
ed to cost $8 million to $9 million and will be 
the main focus of the fifth annual Noche de Gala, which is a fundraising event hosted by the Sebastian Ferrero Foundation.
Horst and Luisa Ferrero, the founders of 
the foundation, were present at the press con-ference to announce this year’s gala would benefit the hospital’s new lobby.
This year’s Noche de Gala will be held 
Sept. 29.
“We’re proud to have a strong partnership 
with UF&Shands and proud of all the mile-stones we have achieved together,” Horst Fer -
rero said.
Last year, the Sebastian Ferrero Founda-
tion worked with UF&Shands to open the Pe-diatric Emergency Room at Shands Hospital for Children in July.
UF President Bernie Machen expressed his 
gratitude to the Ferreros for all their founda-tion has done for UF&Shands.
“They are the real inspiration behind what 
we’ve been doing here,” Machen said, “and their contributions to Shands and to our com-munity have been noted for a number of years. We really wouldn’t be here without them.”
Guzick said the project is in the general 
conceptual design phase now, but he hopes to begin construction in two to three months.
“We can only do this with philanthropy,” 
Guzick said. There are funds set aside for the project, but he said he hopes to raise money for at least half the cost.
“We’re really indebted to the Ferreros and 
the commitment they’ve shown,” Guzick said.SHANDS , from page 1

� THE SUPERVISOR OF ELECTIONS 
POSITION WAS LEFT VACANT. 
SAMANTHA SHAVELL
Alligator Writer
Student Senate approved summer re-
placement senators and all executive cabi-
net appointments at Tuesday’s Student Senate meeting.
Replacement senators fill in for those 
who aren’t at UF for summer sessions. Senators approved eight agency chairs, four executive directors, 12 executive sec-retaries, three cabinet division chairs and 18 cabinet directors.
Student Body President Tj Villamil said 
everyone who was appointed was quali-fied for the job.
“I think everyone who got appointed 
knows what’s at stake,” he said.The Supervisor of Elections was the 
only position left vacant. Villamil said he wants to wait to fill the spot in the hopes that more people will apply. Two people applied for the position.
Villamil said the appointment will be 
made by June 18.
According to statutes, the Supervisor 
of Elections must have served as an As-sistant Supervisor of Elections or an Elec-tions Commissioner for at least one elec-tion cycle.
Due to their new executive appoint-
ments, Sen. Nha-Uyen Hua and Sen. Trev-or Abbott will be resigning as senators.
In a phone interview, Abbott, who was 
the majority party leader, said Sen. Daniel Landesberg will replace him, which in-cludes a seat in the Senate’s Replacement and Agenda Committee.

Summer reading in Gainesville might be 
more popular than previously thought.
Amazon.com ranked Gainesville as the 
eighth best-read city in the country.
“It’s not surprising,” said Patrick Reakes, 
chairman of Library West. “If you look at the 
statistics on degree levels of the population, you’ll see that they’re clustered around col-lege towns. Those are the people who are go-ing to be reading.”
Other cities on the list included Miami, 
Orlando and college towns like Knoxville, Tenn., Cambridge, Mass., and Berkeley, Ca-lif.
Alexandria, Va., topped the list and also 
bought the most romance novels.
Amazon.com used demographic data based on print and Kindle format book, magazine and newspaper sales in relation to population to rank the cities.
Reakes said about 9,000 books are checked 
out each semester from all UF libraries.
The number is unrepresentative since many students and faculty download e-books and other electronic publications, he said.
Sergii Kutsak, a mathematics graduate 
student, said he likes to read printed books and has read four since January.
“It’s a good thing,” the 27-year-old said. 
“I read to expand my knowledge and devel-op professionally.”

12% NOTuesday’s question: Are you over-
whelmed by the lovebugs in Gainesville?Today’s question: Have you ever bought candy-ﬂ  avored 
tobacco?Attorney general misconduct is nothing new
There are few things more telling about an adminis-tration than cabinet-level appointees. You can learn a lot about the inner workings and unadvertised 
positions of a presidency just by examining the kinds of people who surround the executive and their behavior. 
To some extent, it’s more important to exercise vigi-
lance over unelected ofﬁ  cials than it is to pay attention to elected ofﬁ  cials because they are not directly beholden to the people but are afforded limited oversight by the legislative and judicial branches.
Ultimately, any cabinet ofﬁ  cial serves at the pleasure 
of the president, and his or her activities are representa-tions of the president’s policy.
On Jan. 2, 1920, under democratic President Woodrow 
Wilson, Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer conducted multi-city raids that led to the arrest and extended de-tention without trial of at least 6,000 people. These ar-rests were coordinated under the auspices of rooting out anarchists, radicals and revolutionaries in preparation for an inevitable “Red uprising” known thereafter as the “Palmer Raids.”
Palmer’s conduct was later repudiated by the fact that 
no uprising materialized, and public opinion soured at the authoritarian overreach of the Wilson administra-tion. 
Never criticized or disciplined by Wilson, Palmer re-
mained unrepentant to the end, stating in his 1921 testi-mony before a Senate hearing, “I apologize for nothing that the Department of Justice has done ... I glory in it. I point with pride and enthusiasm to the results of that work; and if ... agents of the Department of Labor were a little rough and unkind ... with these alien agitators, ... I think it might well be overlooked in the general good to the country.”
Today, President Barack Obama’s attorney general, 
Eric Holder, faces mounting calls for his resignation and possible prosecution under a contempt of Congress charge currently being prepared in response to his failure to com-ply with a subpoena issued by the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Com-mittee. This legally binding war-rant demands documents related to the botched “Fast and Furious” operation, which resulted in the 
“gun walking” of thousands of ﬁ  rearms purchased in the United States  into the hands of Mexican drug cartels. 
These weapons were never tracked and later re-
emerged at the scene of the fatal shooting of Border Pa-trol Agent Brian Terry in a ﬁ  reﬁ  ght on U.S. soil.
Holder tellingly made statements early in Obama’s 
term outlining his desire to see a permanent ban on so-called “assault riﬂ  es.” Fast forward to the present, and what appears to be occurring is the exposure of Holder’s botched attempt to manufacture justiﬁ  cation for attack-ing Americans’ Second Amendment right to bear arms.
When repeatedly questioned about his unwillingness 
to comply with congressional subpoenas, Holder de-ﬂ  ected criticism, channeling Palmer’s contempt for the Constitution by ludicrously citing lax U.S. gun laws as the real reason for Mexican cartel violence.
Thus far, Obama’s only commentary on the multi-year 
debacle still assailing the credibility of his justice depart-ment was to deny any knowledge or responsibility, as usual.
The most prescient remaining question is how Obama 
can continue to trumpet his administration as the most transparent in history when, in reality, it is becoming readily apparent that it may ultimately be one of the most secretive and grossly incompetent, if not criminal, ever.

Darts & Laurels
First up, we suggest you seek shelter immediately after 
picking up a copy of the Alligator. That’s why we’re throwing a next-up-boils-hail-rivers-turning-to-blood-locusts-complete-darkness-and-death-of-the-ﬁ  rst-born DART at lovebugs.
There’s not enough windshield wiper ﬂ  uid in the world to 
stop this plague.
In national news, we give an it’s-about-damn-time LAU-
REL to President Barack Obama for coming out in support of 
same-sex marriage. Although it doesn’t do much to actually inﬂ  uence the short-term prospects for policy change, it is a huge step in the right direction for a president to openly sup-port this issue.
Way to go, Prez.Next, we recognize an upstanding citizen and public ser-
vant who does so much for our children. That’s why we’re throwing a worst-reference-to-a-Pixar-movie-ever DART at 
Laurie Bailey-Cutkomp, a teacher at Zephyrhills High School in Pasco County, Fla., who allegedly used a dog collar called the “cone of shame,” taken from the 2009 movie “Up,” to dis-cipline some of her ninth-graders in April.
Looks like Bailey-Cutkomp will have to take her “cone of 
shame” with her to the unemployment ofﬁ  ce. However, we suggest she wears it for a few days to think about what she has done.
What you’re doing right now earned Gainesville some 
recognition recently. That’s why we’re giving a oh-yeah-I-to-tally-read-every-reading-assignment-last-semester LAUREL 
to Gainesville, which Amazon.com named the eighth most 
well-read city.
The list was compiled by looking at places where people 
bought the most books, magazines and newspapers in the past year. Not surprisingly, most of the top cities were college towns, so whether or not most of the books purchased were actually read is debatable.
Regardless, go Gainesville!Of course, we must throw an I-set-ﬁ  re-to-the-van-watched-
it-burn-as-I-touched-your-face DART at the idiot — a 5-foot-
8-inch white male, between 18 and 30 years old — who al-legedly set newspapers on ﬁ  re in the back of the Alligator delivery van. Luckily, the van did not catch ﬁ  re and no one was injured.
People have some serious problems with free speech 
around here.
Finally, we cannot end this week without giving a patri-
otic-bad-ass-dead-on-godlike-billionaire-playboy-philanthro-pist-Tesseract-portal-opening-smashtacular-movie LAUREL  
to “The Avengers.”
It’s amazing.Have a fun and safe weekend, and be sure to check back 
next week!

Most of us have probably seen the 
trailer for Sacha Baron Cohen’s new movie, “The Dictator.”
Coupled with Cohen’s antics in inter-
views and on the red carpet, his latest movie is getting its fair amount of press. Recently he went so far as to irreverently spill the “ashes” of deceased North Korean leader Kim Jong Il on Ryan Seacrest at the Academy Awards.
I’ve never been a fan of Cohen’s work, 
and I’m predicting that his latest movie won’t win me over. In the ﬁ  rst few seconds of the trailer Cohen openly exploits exagger-ated Arabic stereotypes. 
Through these caricatures, Cohen shows 
a complete disregard and inherent disrespect for the Arabic culture.
I don’t believe that different cultures 
should be off-limits from humor; however, there’s a thin line between socially acceptable comedy and ﬂ  agrant racism.Political comedian Dean Obeidallah, in 
a column for CNN.com, equated Cohen’s dictator costume to white actors donning blackface in the late 19th century. Blackface was used in minstrel shows as caricatures of African-Americans. 
Today, it is openly acknowledged that 
blackface is blatantly racist. Shouldn’t Co-hen’s costume, which does the same for Ar-abs that blackface did for African-Americans, be held in the same regard?
Obeidallah also writes that there are no 
actors or writers of Arab descent involved in the movie. Ben Kingsley, who co-stars, is of Indian descent and is the only person re-motely from the region.
The movie would have fared better if it 
included Arabic writers or actors. Their in-put would have rendered funnier jokes and representations grounded in reality. 
The lack of care in assembling the cast and crew shows Cohen’s disregard of the Arabic cul-ture. He would rather garner cheap laughs than produce a movie with an 
ounce of authenticity.
Cohen’s depiction of negative Arabic ste-
reotypes is not only racist but also reinforces a deeper political undertone. Recently, the United States was responsible for the remov-al of several Arabic dictators — the latest was Muammar Gaddaﬁ  .
It also appears that the U.S. has its sights 
set on Iran and Syria. Our current political environment makes it impossible for this movie to be “silly fun.”
Cohen’s main character, Admiral General Shabazz Aladeen, continues to demonize de-ceased foreign leaders and prolongs the thirst for war. This movie promotes a deep dislike of Arabic culture through false stereotypes and could further propagate conﬂ  ict.
Citizens of the U.S. will never quench 
their thirst for foreign wars if they keep be-ing fed stale, dry and racist jokes.
A prominent ﬁ  gure like Cohen and his 
“comedy” only add fuel to the burning ﬁ  re. Due to his position in the public eye, his words and actions are bound to inﬂ  uence the minds of the ignorant.
These opinions formed on false stereo-
types and extravagant depictions will in turn instigate the need for incessant violence. You will end up with people eating lunch next to you, reading the same textbooks and craving the end of a whole culture.

Cohen’s ‘The Dictator’ reinforces Arabic stereotypesColumn
Last semester, the Alligator ran a comic strip that al-
luded to a scene from an Indiana Jones movie. In the comic, the character, Short Round, who is Asian, in-
quired about the keyboard clacking noises coming from the study-in led by the Computer and Information Science and Engineering students.
His line in the comic is, “What that sound? Maybe I step 
on Chinese fortune cookie?”
The cartoonist chose to make his lines grammatically in-
correct and ultimately portrayed Short Round to be speak-ing Engrish, not English. This idea perpetuates the stereo-type that Asian-Paciﬁ  c Islander American members are not able to communicate with correct grammar and converse in a style called “broken English.”
If the editors of the Alligator knew that Short Round was so blatantly stereotyped in the mov-ie, why would they allow this comic to be published in its newspaper?
Michael Satyapor, president of 
the Asian American Student Union, 
voiced his concern by saying, “There are many stereotyped characters in existence and encouraging these ideas is not good. There are so many ways to utilize humor and social commentary without resorting to such nonsense.”
Although I can’t speak for the entire Asian-Paciﬁ  c Is-
lander American community at UF and beyond, the Alliga-tor should be informed that the comic was offensive, and messages of disrespect to one’s community will not be toler-ated.
Society has been told that Asian Americans are the model minority group that will choose to stay quiet and behave appropriately, unlike other minority groups that would be more inclined to ﬁ  ght back.
I’m writing this to speak up against that notion. I want 
the Alligator staff and the overall UF community to be edu-cated on how media can be used to oppress or stereotype an entire community and how to effectively communicate without doing such things.
There should also be more education around ethical 
decision-making on whether an article or comic should be published.
We all have a responsibility to confront and challenge ste-
reotypes and to empower our community by doing so.

Whether you are a beer aficio-
nado, occasionally indulge your 
inner Sam Adams or just want an excuse to booze, American Craft Beer Week kicked off Monday to celebrate the masterful hop-bar -
ley-yeast concoction — aka fun in a bottle.
The celebratory week was 
started to help craft brewers con-nect to fans and to educate pa-trons on the art of brew.
“It’s an opportunity for brew-
ers around the country to get people focused on what we’re doing,” Swamp Head Brewery brewer Craig Birkmaier said.
Beer has come a long way from 
being just something to chug at a frat party or NASCAR race, to a multitude of foreign and local artisan ingredients strategically brewed for a variety of tastes, colors and styles. 
Like fine wines, microbrews 
have flavor, smell and texture characteristics that are distin-guishable and unique. Depend-ing on a person’s palate, many desirable traits can be detected — bitter, hoppy, smooth, floral, sour, malty, full-bodied, smoky or even spicy.
Swamp Head Brewery, 3140 
SW 42nd way, and a few beer bars around Gainesville planned to celebrate American Craft Beer Week. 
Wednesday, Swamp Head 
held the People’s Choice Brew Day, where it solicited requests of different types of beer from fans via social media, and dem-onstrated beer brewing on a small pilot system based off of the best recipes it received. 
Friday they will hold a pub 
crawl where the crew will visit many different bars in down-town Gainesville, offer discounts and give out free merchandise. Starting at 8 p.m., it will visit The Midnight, Palomino, Stubbie’s, House of Beer, The Bull, Tall Paul’s and Loosey’s.
Tall Paul’s Brew House, which brews in-house under the name Alligator Brewing Company, will feature 10 different microbrews on tap during the full course of the week, according to head brewer Neal Mackowiak.
“It’s been something we’ve 
been building up for — it’s the responsibility of craft-beer bars to educate people,” Mackowiak said.
Stubbie’s is offering week-
long specials, including $1 off all American crafts on tap, select  $3-craft bottles and $2 off Swamp Head pints on Friday, manager Peter Burke said.
Alcove and The Top will fea-
ture beers from local breweries, such as Tampa brewery Cigar City Brewing. The Top was ren-ovated in March to expand its micro draft beer capability three-fold, from 12 to 36 taps.
As a town that loves its local 
products, it’s no wonder Gaines-ville’s first microbrewery, Swamp Head, has experienced tremen-dous success, evident by its pres-ence and demand in many bars and restaurants in Gainesville.
“Our experience has been phe-
nomenal because of people going out and asking for the product,” Birkmaier said.Founded in 2008 by UF grad 
Luke Kemper, Swamp Head is looking to expand its 10-barrel brew system.
“We are starting to look for a 
30-barrel brew house,” Birkmaier explained.
This would allow Swamp 
Head to triple its production to more than 300 barrels per week and distribute to a wider audi-ence. Birkmaier said they would have to move to a larger space and already have their eye on a few new locations. Birkmaier said the move will not affect produc-tion and it will continue brewing at the old location until things are up and running.
“People are now willing to 
spend a little more money for a local, higher quality product,” Birkmaier said. Swamp Head, and most craft beers cost around $5 for a pint and range from about 5-to-10 percent alcohol.
Gainesville’s support of mov-
ing away from generic beer to lo-cal artisan crafts is also evident by downtown beer bars that seem to multiply.

concentrated beer scene in Flor -

Vishal Agarwala was tired of bands he 
loved not touring in Gainesville, so he started 
his own company to bring his favorite artists here.
Now Garage Mahal Presents, the former 
Grooveshark employee’s promotions com-pany, has booked close to 40 live shows in Gainesville. Booked artists have included R.A.C., a collective of musicans that remix different genres of music, and the punk band Black Lips.
Agarwala said the company identiﬁ  es the 
potential audience in Gainesville for a genre of music and then brings in bands with the best live performances. Audience members may not be familiar with every band at a show, but they come expecting a great live concert.
“I deﬁ  nitely feel like it’s a service to the 
community, and it’s appreciated,” Agarwala said.Warren Oakes, former drummer of Against 
Me! and a client of Garage Mahal Presents, agreed that the company has contributed to bringing live music to Gainesville.
Garage Mahal Presents acts as a liaison 
between bands and seven Gainesville venues including Double Down Live and The Atlan-tic.
Agarwala’s staff includes an assistant 
agent and a street team of about eight people. A freelance designer is used to create promo-tional material.
Two to four shows have been booked by 
Garage Mahal Presents each month since the company’s creation in January 2011.
In March, a Garage Mahal Presents con-
cert featuring the Black Lips reached capacity at The Backyard, a venue owned by Oakes. The band hadn’t toured in Gainesville since 2009.
For several touring bands like the Black 
Lips, shows in Gainesville are sporadic. Be-cause of travel expenses, some bands refrain from booking shows in Florida.“Everyone plays Atlanta because Atlanta 
is on the way to everywhere,” Oakes said. “Once you dip into Florida, you’re guaran-teed to have to backtrack.”
Oakes also said that Gainesville’s well-
connected community of concert seekers has helped deﬁ  ne the Garage Mahal brand name. Audiences have begun to associate the pro-motions company and its associated venues with high-quality live performances.“At this point, people just trust us not to 
book bad shows,” he said.
Garage Mahal Presents will relocate to 
New York this year, Agarwala said. He plans to move from Gainesville in June, leaving his current assistant agent, John Berna, in charge of the company.
Eventually, Berna will rebrand the com-
pany and Agarwala will continue Garage Mahal Presents in New York.
During the summer, the company will try 
to book more student bands that are unable to tour during the school year, Berna said. Fewer shows have been booked for summer months because of the lack of student popu-lation.
“It’s a good time for the transition,” he 
said. “Lots of people are out of town.”

ence members.  A fan threw himself into the crowd attempting to surf.
Roughly 40 shows have been booked in a year
Many bars will continue its beer specials through Saturday 
of,” Alcove Owner Evan Yavelberg said.
While a few staple bars such as Stubbies & 
Steins, The Top and Alcove have offered craft 
selection for years, newer bars such as Tall Paul’s Brew House, House of Beer, The Bull, Loosey’s and The Midnight have sprouted up to accommodate craft beer demand.
“The reason I chose 
Gainesville as a place to 
open the bar was 
because of the de-
mand — it was 
an open mar-ket,” Paul Ev-ans, the 6-foot-7-inch owner of 
Tall Paul’s Brew 
House, said.
Florida was 
relatively late to the craft-beer trend, with major microbrewer-ies emerging only in the last few years. Pio-neer states such as California and Colorado saw craft breweries begin brewing in the late 1990s.
“We were late to the party, but things are 
starting to evolve,” Birkmaier added. “Micro-brewing is starting to take off — a lot of that has to do with tasting rooms.”
Tasting rooms are small bars attached to 
the breweries that allow beer drinkers to visit the brewery while tasting permanent and ex-perimental beers. This allows fans to connect with local breweries, it also allows the brew-ery to recirculate proﬁ  ts directly back into its brewery, instead of the usual three-tiered proﬁ  t system where beer goes from the brew-ery to the distribution company to the bar or restaurant where it is served.
Some bars expressed concerns over this 
week falling during a time when school is on break and beer-loving students and faculty may be out of town.
“We’re in between two semesters, so it 
will be interesting to see how many people respond to this,” Mackowiak said.
The art of making beer has surpassed sim-
ply going to beer bars, and some take matters into their own hands and experiment with home brewing.
“The Hogtown Brewers are very strong 
as well — we have a very educated public,” Burke said.
The homebrew club, which has been 
around since 1985, provides monthly educa-tion and social outings for homebrewers in Gainesville. The club also put on a craft beer festival in April, where it had beer sampling, beer and food pairing, homebrew demonstra-tions and educational seminars.
Homebodies looking to indulge can ﬁ  nd 
large beer selections at beer stores Tipple’s Brews, Gator Beverage and Ward’s Super-market.

Two months ago, Sarah Goff and Mike 
Myers sat outside a colossal empty ware-
house in a mountain of old clothes, vinyl records, picture frames and empty vases. They waited. They sold trinkets at yard sales every Saturday. They waited some more.
They eventually sold enough to open 
The Repurpose Project in that warehouse, which is now almost ﬁ  lled with art sup-plies, sculptures and paintings.
The Repurpose Project is an organiza-
tion that collects materials that would nor-mally go to waste and uses them to create art. 
The establishment, located in down-
town Gainesville at 519 S. Main St., is a three-part art studio: a workspace for art creation, a gallery for art display and a re-used art supply store.
“What we’re really trying to do is ﬁ  ll 
the recycle void,” Goff said, toting a purse made from old VHS ﬁ  lm. “There are a lot of great materials out there with no place to go.”
Goff pointed to a painting and explained 
that the canvas was found in a Dumpster on UF campus.  Artist Christina Rohan sal-vaged the paint from the Hazardous Waste Collection Center.
“We ask artists to use 75 percent recy-
cled materials, but they usually use a lot more,” Meyers said.
The art center encompasses many forms 
of art such as carvings, collages, jewelry making, crafts and painting.
Goff said they attain the reusable ma-
terials by donation from individuals and businesses.“Businesses spend a lot of money on 
disposal, and we’re giving them a place where they can take their waste,” Goff said. “They can reduce costs, save money and green their business.”
The Repurpose Project is a volunteer-
based gallery, which currently houses eight artists and one intern who helps or-ganize the donated materials. 
Goff said they hope to start running 
workshops where they will educate people on certain forms of arts and crafts.
Goff has previously worked at Trash to 
Treasure, a creative reuse center in South 
Florida. Myers, who met Goff when she was look-ing for recycled lumber to build a tree house, has been in the recycling business for more than 40 years. He also works to educate children on re-
use by holding workshops in Gainesville schools. He hopes to hold similar work-shops to teach art with The Repurpose Project.
“It’s all about diversion from landﬁ  lls 
and creating things people can use,” My-ers said.
The Repurpose Project is currently look-
ing for volunteers, artists and people to run education workshops. It’s open Mon-days 6 p.m. to 8 p.m., Fridays 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. and Saturdays 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Myers said the center will also be par-
ticipating in Art Walk Gainesville, an event that connects local artists to the com-munity every last Friday of the month.
“People seem very excited about what 
we’re doing,” Meyers said. “We get a lot of positive response,” Goff added.10, ALLIGATOR   THURSDAY, MAY 17, 2012

It might be the sweetest word 
in the English language — espe-
cially to college students who sustain themselves off of Ramen and whatever else they can find when foraging through their re-frigerators.
Free. As in no charge, as in one 
of the few things we can actually afford.
One of the oldest and arguably 
best freebies in Gainesville, Free Fridays, has begun to host its summer-long concert series.
The city’s Parks, Recreation 
and Cultural Affairs department presents free concerts each Fri-day from May 4 until Oct. 12.
David Ballard coordinates 
events downtown, including Free Fridays. He said between 500 and 1,500 people usually attend the shows each week.
“We get such an incredible va-
riety of people,” Ballard said. “It seems to fit into the whole down-town party.”
This year, the shows will range 
in genre from blues to ska and from bluegrass to tribute bands. The Relics, a Woodstock tribute band, once performed at the con-cert series and drew in a crowd of roughly 3,000, Ballard said.
Libby Rens, a first-year hor -
ticulture doctoral student, said she’s been going to Free Fridays for the past two years and loves how it brings the community to-gether.
She’ll often go out downtown after the shows, which she said typically end around 10 p.m.
“It gets everybody out to have a good time on Fridays,” the 26-year-old said. 
“Everyone’s on the lawn with blankets and chairs. You can get beer. It’s a really good time.”2012 “Free Fridays” Concert Series

“’Dear God,’ Gabel would pray as a teenager, 
‘When I wake up tomorrow morning, I want a female body.’”
Against Me! frontman Tom Gabel spoke out last week in 
a big way, revealing exclusively to Rolling Stone magazine that he is transgender, has spent almost his entire life feeling trapped in the wrong skin and will be undergoing the steps necessary to transition into a woman.
That quote, taken from Josh Eells’ “The Secret Life of Tom 
Gabel” in Rolling Stone, Issue 1157, is perhaps the shortest summation of the seemingly hellish personal life of Gabel — the life he struggled through as he led the Gainesville-based Against Me! to become one of the most recognized political-punk bands in the country. From his life as a young teenager in Florida, to Against Me!’s rise with “Searching for a Former Clarity,” to the band’s most recent and best-selling record, “White Crosses,” Gabel has struggled with a condi-tion known as gender dysphoria.
As the Rolling Stone article explains it, gender dysphoria 
is “a feeling of intense dissatisfaction and disconnect from the gender you were assigned at birth.” Gabel puts it more bluntly, “It’s a feeling of detachment from your body and from yourself. And it’s shitty, man. It’s really fucking shit-ty.”
When Gabel’s feelings swelled to the point where he de-cided it was time to transition to presenting as a female, he told his band (“I felt like I drop-kicked them in the face”) and he told his wife, Heather. The couple’s 2-year-old daughter, Evelyn, isn’t quite old enough to understand.
To Gabel’s intense relief, everyone took it well. His band-
mates stood beside him. Heather remained strong for him. The couple will remain together, still as in love as ever. Ga-bel’s mom took the news well too.
Gabel’s new name is Laura Jane Grace. She will take hor-
mones and undergo electrolysis treatments that will make her feel and appear more feminine. She might have surgery in a couple of years. Right now, she’s just taking it one step at a time.
Laura Jane Grace’s decision is an intensely intimate one, 
but due to Against Me!’s prominence, it’s a decision that has been left to the scrutiny of millions on the Internet. Fortu-nately, the punk community that has supported Against Me! for years has responded mainly with support. And the com-munity should be supportive — everyone should.
The same day Laura’s decision made headlines on the 
websites of every major news source, North Carolina an-nounced its ban on gay marriage. It was clear on that day more than most that we live in a society that is not accepting of all cultures and choices. Living in North Florida, most of us have seen people demonstrate small-mindedness, some-times on our very own campus, on our very own Turlington Plaza. Many people use religion as their reasoning for re-jecting new ideas about marriage, and they certainly would reject a decision like Laura’s.
This is why every ounce of support is so important and 
essential at this time. Laura’s decision is one that took an enormous amount of bravery, an unimaginable amount of courage; really, the list of adjectives could go on and on. Not everyone has the influence to make an impact as big as Laura’s, but she demonstrates how willing we all should be to do whatever it takes to carry our lives out the way we want to.
Above all, this decision is not one that should make you 
feel angry or repulsed in any way. If you do find yourself resenting Laura’s decision, ask yourself why. Not only does it not affect you, but Tom is becoming happier by becom-ing Laura. Doing what makes you happy is, by far, the most punk thing a person can do.
Oh, and as for the future of the band; Laura intends to 
continue on and become the frontwoman of Against Me!
“However fierce our band was in the past,” she tells 
Rolling Stone, “Imagine me, six-foot-two in heels, fucking screaming in someone’s face.”Against Me! frontman Tom Gabel comes out as transgendercolumn

There was a sea of purple. 
Jiggling, swaying, jumping and 
shaking. Waiting for the woman on stage to command them. The woman was Margie Weiss, moth-er of Rachel Morningstar Hoff-man.
In May of 2008, Hoffman was 
acting as an informant for the Tal-lahassee Police Department when a poorly executed drug sting led to her death.
“I went to Rachel’s grave to-
day;” Weiss said, “but she doesn’t live there, she lives here.”      
She gestured to the open air of 
the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park and the crowd erupted.
After Hoffman’s death, her 
family and friends worked to get a bill implemented that requires Florida law enforcement agencies to create guidelines with specific requirements when using police informants.  Some of those regu-lations include assessment of the informants maturity level, age, risk level of the mission and emo-tional state.
In May 2009, Gov. Charlie 
Crist signed that bill titled “Ra-chel’s Law.”
To fund the passing of the law 
and to celebrate the life of their daughter and friend, the Morn-ingstar Foundation began host-ing a music festival in 2008, The Purple Hatters Ball.
The festival is named in re-
membrance of Hoffman, who was often seen at concerts and music festivals wearing a big smile and a fuzzy purple hat.“The purple hat is a happy, 
colorful symbol. It creates a nice, warm memory for our friend,” Paul Levine, friend of Hoffman and member of the board of di-rectors for her foundation, said.
Last weekend was the fifth 
annual music 
festival held at Suwannee Mu-sic Park in Live Oak.  It is locat-ed one hour and 15 minutes north of Gainesville.
About 1,900 
music lovers, family and friends of Hoffman attended this year, a significant increase from the esti-mated 700 attendees in 2010.
According to Levine, 2011 was 
the first year the organization made a profit from the festival.“It was rewarding for every-
one who was involved to just break even in the early years,” Levine said. “Bills come in late and we’re still tallying expenses, but I believe we made at least $10,000 this year.”
The proceeds go toward the 
Morningstar Foundation. Its am-bition is to attempt to national-ize “Rachel’s Law” as well as strengthen state laws.
According to Levine, the 
bands can’t afford to play for free but since The Purple Hatters Ball is a benefit the bands play for half or less than they would normally charge given the circumstances.
“A lot of these groups put in 
a lot of good work early on, now that the festival is on its own feet, it is easier to pay bands,” Levine said. “We don’t want them to play for free, we want to support them.”
The Heavy Pets, a rock group that blends rhythm and blues, jazz, funk and reggae from Fort Lauderdale, said it enjoys play-ing for an event with a cause such as this.
All weekend the acts on stage 
reminded the audience of the rea-son for being at the park.   
Break Science, an electronic 
bass music duo, was joined by hip-hop MC Chali 2na. Before the set began, the men had the crowd scream “Rachel.” Other groups such as Dubconscious, gave in-spirational tribute speeches at the end of its sets.
The music festival was held 
in the middle of May for the past three years, and according to Levine, the foundation has no plans to discontinue it.
“We expect to keep hosting 
an annual festival,” he said. “We won’t let her be forgotten.”
The Purple Hatters Ball music festival honors Rachel HoffmanRyan Russell
Against Me! is a punk band that began in 1997 and once called Gainesville their home base.  Frontman, Tom Gabel, 
pictured second from the right is joined by his bandmates for promo shots taken in 2011.

Johnny Magliozzi pitches against USF on April 24. In his Tuesday start against Samford, Magliozzi gave up five earned runs on seven hits in just 1.2 innings.
JOE MORGAN
Alligator Staff Writer
 
All it took for No. 3 Florida’s offense to 
come alive was a midweek trip to Samford. 
Unfortunately for UF, the trek to Alabama knocked its strong pitching down a notch.
The Gators tallied seven runs, but gave up 
12 in a road loss to the Bulldogs (34-19) on Tuesday. Despite the scoring outburst, Flori-da played from behind throughout after giv-ing up seven runs to Samford in the first four frames. UF did not score its first run until the fifth inning.
“The thing that really, really hurts is we 
finally started swinging the bat (well) there in the middle of the game,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “We scored five runs there in the fifth, sixth and seventh, and then we turned around and gave up five in return.”
O’Sullivan decided to rest top relievers 
Austin Maddox and Steven Rodriguez Tues-day, especially after starter Johnny Magliozzi’s rough start to the ball game. Magliozzi gave up five earned runs on seven hits in just 1.2 in-nings. The bullpen did not fare much better.
Ryan Harris, Keenan Kish and Daniel Gib-
son surrendered seven more runs on a com-bined eight hits, undoing the Gators’ mid-game rally.
Samford’s assault on Florida’s relief corps 
did not stop until Bobby Poyner entered the game in the seventh and pitched a scoreless 1.2 frames to end the game.“I thought Poyner threw the ball good,” 
O’Sullivan said. “Just disappointed in the middle part of the game there. Some older guys just weren’t able to put up zeros on the board.”
The Gators scored their first two runs in 
the fifth and sixth innings, but the Bulldogs answered with three runs in that same span.
Perhaps the most frustrating mistake came 
when Kish plunked Samford center fielder Philip Ervin with two outs and nobody on base. The next batter, Bulldogs right fielder Brandon Miller, hit his nation-leading 20th home run of the season.
UF also hit the leadoff batter in the fifth in-
ning and the second batter in the fourth.
“It’s not real smart baseball,” O’Sullivan 
said in response to his pitchers hitting bat-ters.
After Sunday’s 2-1 win against Mississippi 
State, Mike Zunino attributed part of Florida’s struggles to bad luck.
“(We) haven’t been catching some breaks,” 
the junior catcher said.
That mantra held true Tuesday, especially 
considering how Florida scored seven runs — six of which came with two outs  — and still 
lost. 
After Josh Tobias struck out swinging and 
Taylor Gushue flied out to center field to lead 
off the seventh, Nolan Fontana walked on a full count. Then, Preston Tucker singled, set-ting up a three-run homer by Zunino.

For sprinter Leonardo Seymore, change 
is nothing new. The junior’s first taste came 
when he transferred to Florida from Rend Lake College last year.
Although the transition from athletics 
at a junior college level to a Division I uni-versity may be tough, Seymore has proved that he can handle the competition and is on to his next transition.
Despite having four top-10 performanc-
es, including a win running in the 200 me-ters during the indoor season, Seymore found his stride in relay events. During the outdoor season, coach Mike Holloway decided to add Seymore into the rotation, 
joining Dedric Dukes, Hugh Graham and Tony 
McQuay in the 4x400 me-ter relay and Jeff Demps, McQuay and Dukes in the 4x100 meter relay.
“It’s been fun,” Sey-
more said. “When I first got on there it was kind of tough. I was like ‘Wow, 
I don’t know if I’m going to be able to do this.’ But the more you put me in some-thing, the better I get.”Seymore adjusting to new

After four years of rewriting record 
books and racking up awards, Mi-chelle Moultrie is now only missing 
her Hollywood ending. And there’s nothing that would beat riding off in the sunset with a championship trophy in hand.
  But before Moultrie could dream of a na-
tional title, she had to make the team.
  Moultrie, a senior ﬁ  nance major from Jack-
sonville, thought that’s all she would ever be at the University of Florida. While softball play-ers around the state were signing Division I scholarships, the only thing Moultrie received after high school was a diploma.
    Despite earning a spot on the Class 6A All-
State Team for three years in high school, as well as leading her team to the state’s ﬁ  nal four in 2008, Moultrie never heard from UF softball coach Tim Walton. 
  So she went to him.  The incoming freshman took it upon her-
self to sign up for one of Walton’s softball camps that he ran over the summer. 
  “I came to [UF’s softball] camp just to get 
coach Walton to see me,” Moultrie said. “I didn’t really have any expectations, I was just going to come out and give it my best.”
  Walton, the reigning Southeastern Confer-
ence Coach of the Year, had just led the Gators to an NCAA-record 70 wins and a berth in the  national semiﬁ  nals as the No. 1 seed in 2008. 
  But it was a gut feeling he had while watch-
ing Moultrie during camp that would mold Walton’s success for the next four years.
  Florida boasted a stacked roster with nine 
upperclassmen and All-Americans Kelsey Bruder and Stephanie Brombacher. But Wal-ton decided to invite Moultrie back to try out for the team.
  The 5-foot-4 speedster showed off her pa-
tience at the plate and her quickness on the bases. Impressed, Walton made Moultrie the newest member of his squad.
  “If we were to rank our top-ﬁ  ve outﬁ  eld-
ers right now, [Moultrie] would probably be in our top ﬁ  ve,” Walton said in a press confer-ence before the 2009 season. “She is our fast-est player on the team so she can come off [the bench] and do a lot of different things. I like that weapon to have there at our disposal whenever we need it.”
  However, rather than charging out of the 
gates, Moultrie struggled in the early going.
  She ranked near the bottom of the squad 
with a .261 average, and in SEC games, she brought up the rear with a .212 hitting clip. Her struggles at the plate carried onto the ﬁ  eld where she had the worst ﬁ  elding percentage (.906) among starters. Moultrie’s three errors in 2009 were more than she would make in the next three years combined.
  “She was very , very unsure of herself when 
she ﬁ  rst got here,” Bruder said. “She would catch the ball and just let it pop right out of her glove.”
  Although the Gators advanced to their ﬁ  rst 
Women’s College World Series Championship in 2009, Moultrie was a non-factor. She was far from the promising player Walton had given a chance to play D-I softball the previous sum-mer.
  “I think I was trying to just get into a 
groove,” Moultrie said. “It takes time, as any freshman takes time, to get used to the pitch-ing level and things like that.”
  After saying goodbye to First-Team All-
Americans Stacey Nelson, Ali Gardiner and ﬁ  ve other seniors after the 2009 campaign, Florida desperately needed a push from the bottom to rise to the top again. 
  Moultrie provided that push.  With a year under her belt, she skyrocketed 
from rock bottom to the top of her team with a .389 batting average and 72 hits.
  As the full-time patroller of center ﬁ  eld in 
2010, Moultrie made only one error, led the team with six outﬁ  eld assists and maintained a .984 ﬁ  elding percentage. 
  Even she was surprised by the turn-
around.   “I’ve just got to praise God for the abilities 
that He’s given me,” she said. “I never thought that I’d come this far. I want to thank God, my coaches and my teammates for helping me to be the best that I can be.”
  Like Moultrie, Walton, too, was shocked 
that she could walk onto a national champi-onship-caliber  team and become the Gators’ catalyst within a year.
  “She’s better than anyone could ever ex-
pect,” he said. “I just can’t believe that one individual could be that good in such a short period of time.”
  After earning a spot on the 2010 All-SEC 
Second Team and a permanent starting role for Florida, Moultrie was ready to assume her upperclassman duties as a leader.
  Not only did Moultrie lead by example on 
the ﬁ  eld with her record-breaking 2011 sea-son (she broke six UF single-season records including a .443 batting average and 101 hits), but she led with her calm demeanor.
  When the Gators reached the pinnacle of 
the softball world by advancing to the WCWS for the second time in three years at the end of last season, Moultrie showed the country why she earned her high praise and awards.
  Although Florida was outscored 21-6 in a 
two-game sweep by Arizona State, the 2011 All-American centerﬁ  elder was still able to earn the honors of being named the WCWS Co-Most Outstanding Player  as well as mak-ing the WCWS All-Tournament Team.
  “I’m not hung up on the (WCWS) loss at 
all,” Moultrie said. “Just the College World Series experience is a huge motivation to play your best.”
  And when asked what she would do if her 
team faced ASU in the ﬁ  nals again, Moultrie did not have revenge in mind. She simply said she would try to do what she failed to do last year: win.
  It is Moultrie’s dedication to her craft that 
has garnered respect from her teammates.   
Sophomore Cheyenne Coyle has seen 
Moultrie’s inﬂ  uence ﬁ  rsthand.
  “Michelle is a great leader by example,” 
Coyle said. “People will just sit and be quiet to watch Michelle. And if Michelle does say something, everybody is dead quiet and they listen. But deﬁ  nitely Michelle is the silent lead-er.”
  Walton has seen Moultrie grow into a 
strong leader for a young team. 
  “She has really taken on and embraced that 
leadership type role that she didn’t have in previous years, (because) she didn’t have to,” Walton said. “She has really stepped up into that role.”
  As Florida’s lone senior, Moultrie has be-
come the face of the program having accumu-lated several accolades and awards.
  “She makes every play offensively,” Wal-
ton said. “She makes every play defensively . She’s someone special. If you could take ﬁ  ve more Michelles, we’d never lose.”
  Moultrie’s years of effort and dedication 
to the program was celebrated on her senior day April 28. Knowing Moultrie’s time in Gainesville was nearing an end, each player expressed her love for Moultrie with a ﬂ  ower and a hug. 
  “I just remember during our banquet, 
[Moultrie] made a speech and we were all bawling our eyes out,” freshman Lauren Hae-ger said. “It’s gone by so fast. It was very emo-tional. It’s always sad to see someone like that go, but we’re very happy for her and every-thing that she has accomplished.”  
  Even with the standing ovations, the 
15-minute pre-game ceremony and, not to mention, a 2-for-4 day with a home run and two RBI, Moultrie did not want her senior day to be the storybook send off that most players dream of.
  She wants a championship.  The road to Oklahoma City , the annual site 
of the WCWS, begins with a regional round matchup against Florida Gulf Coast on Friday night at 6 at home. Behind Moultrie, the Gators will look to improve on their 41-27 record in the NCAA Tournament and advance to their third championship series in four years.
  When asked what it would feel like to ﬁ  -
nally capture that elusive ﬁ  rst title, Moultrie paused to think.
  “I don’t know,” she said. “Us being able 
to overcome what we didn’t do last year ... would just be another great memory that you can have here with the girls.”

2012 Southeastern Conference Player of the Year Michelle Moultrie bats against Chatta-
nooga March 14. Moultrie leads UF with 58 runs, 21 stolen bases and 108 total bases.
National title motivates Moul trieAlthough Seymore still 
competes in the 200 meter, 
his transition to relay teams has seemed to be effortless.
“Coach (Holloway) had 
changed my workout plan,” Seymore said. “That helped me build my endurance to finish races and be strong to do what I had to do to help my team out.”
Seymore opened up his 
outdoor season competing at the Clyde Littlefield Tex-as Relays. That weekend he helped secure a fifth-place finish in the 4x100 and a third-place finish in the 4x400. 
Since then, Seymore has 
gone on to get three wins in the 4x400. The latest victory came last weekend at the Southeastern Conference Outdoor Championships.
“It was kind of tough, 
but I was in a better position than I was last year because last year I tore my quad and didn’t get a chance to run,” Seymore said.
In addition to his wins 
in the 4x400, Seymore had a second-place finish at the Pepsi Florida Relays in the 4x100 and a win at the Tom Jones Memorial Clas-sic where the team’s time of 38.67 seconds is still cur -
rently the second-fastest collegiate time this season.
Even though Seymore 
excels in both relays, he en-joys the pressure and com-petition that comes with the 4x400 more.
“The 4x1 is exciting, but I don’t think it’s as exciting as the 4x4,” Seymore said. “The 4x4 is the last event of the day and everybody’s there, standing on their feet and it’s just more challeng-ing. You get the stick and you’re like ‘Oh man, you got a whole lap to run.’ But when you get the stick in the 4x1 it’s just over so quick.”
With the Gators using 
their off weekend to pre-pare for the NCAA Prelimi-nary Rounds starting May 24 in Jacksonville, Seymore is looking forward to com-peting in the meet and is confident in his team’s abil-ity to succeed.
“I’ve never been to a 
NCAA meet, so I’m very excited and hoping that ev-erything works out well,” Seymore said.
“I think we’re going to 
do pretty well. If everybody just sticks together, puts their heads together and does what they got to do, we should come out with a victory.”

UF has won three straight against PSU
took on No. 5 seed Duke in the 
Quarterfinals and lost 13-9. 
Junior attacker Ashley Bruns 
felt winning a national title was an attainable goal last season and expressed disappointment that the team fell short of its ultimate goal.
“I feel like last year we did have 
high expectations and we accom-plished a lot,” Bruns said. “But as our program’s growing we have all these great new additions. Last year I feel like we could have done it, but there was some things that we need to learn and grow more, so this year is a really great oppor-tunity for us.”
For Florida, this matchup is a 
familiar one. The Gators hosted the Nittany Lions  on April 1, and 
came out on top with a 20-11 win, m a r k i n g 
the third consecutive year that they have defeated their confer -
ence foe. 
Junior goalie Mikey Meagher 
got the win for Florida that day, allowing just nine goals in 47-plus minutes in the net.
Although the team has an idea 
of what to expect from its op-ponent, Meagher said that both squads have evolved over the course of the season.
“I think at this point in the sea-
son we’re two different teams than when we played each other be-fore,” Meagher said.
“They’ve grown; we’ve grown, 
so I think we’ll be looking for a very exciting game again against this team. They have a lot of threats of-fensively, defensively so it should be a pretty good matchup.”
