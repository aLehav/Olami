MIAMI GARDENS — Florida 
got away with living dangerously 
in 2012. Saturday did not prove as kind. The No. 12 Gators’ (1-1) stout defense could not make up for a mistake-prone offense in a 21-16 loss to the Hurricanes (2-0) in Sun Life Stadium.
A ﬁ  ve-turnover effort in Satur-
day’s defeat does not alter Florida’s season. A loss to the Hurricanes does not knock the Gators out of Southeastern Conference conten-tion, which paves the way to the BCS Championship Game.
With a bye week to recuperate 
before welcoming Tennessee to The Swamp on Sept. 21, Florida is fo-cused on moving on.
“We’re going to have to respond 
from this and not hang our heads,” quarterback Jeff Driskel said. “It’s frustrating right now, but we’ve still got a lot of football to play this year.”
In the mean time, Driskel, who 
enjoyed a career-high 291 passing yards and not much else in a three-turnover performance, and the Gators have a lot to think about.
Florida’s past three defeats — 
Georgia, Louisville and Miami — have all come in a similar fashion. The Gators pride themselves on ef-ﬁ  ciency and turnover margin but came up short in both categories during each contest. UF has com-mitted 14 turnovers and scored only seven times in 14 red-zone trips in its past three losses.
The stakes were higher in Jack-
sonville and New Orleans than they were in Miami Gardens on Satur-day, but that did not lessen the dis-appointment.
“We’ve just got to play smart 
football,” coach Will Muschamp said. “You can’t throw the ball into trafﬁ  c in the red zone. In those criti-cal situations, you’re taking points off the board. You create momen-tum for the other team. A lot of things go on when that happens. It’s not just the fact that you had a turn-over. Those are situations that we’ve got to correct.”
The ﬁ  rst mistake came from an 
unlikely source — starting running back Matt Jones. 
Jones made his season debut 
against the Hurricanes after a viral infection he contracted in July kept him out of pads until the week be-fore the season opener against To-ledo.
Jones ﬁ  nished with only 47 yards 
on 18 carries.VOLUME 108 ISSUE 13 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 2013

The Gainesville City Commission has al-
ready started planning for the 2014 football 
season by passing stricter rules pertaining to residents selling parking in their yards on gameday.
Effective 2014, parking on residential lots 
will be allowed from 8 a.m. to midnight or three hours after the game has ended — whichever occurs later. Vehicles that remain parked in a residential area after that window of time must be left overnight and cannot be accessed until the next morning.
The regulations also regulate portable toilets 
on private property.
A 4-3 vote at a Thursday meeting approved 
the new measures. Mayor Ed Braddy, City Commissioner Yvonne Hinson-Rawls and City Commissioner Todd Chase cast the dissenting votes.According to the ordinance, violating these 
terms could bring a $250 code enforcement ﬁ  ne, and multiple violations will put a property’s gameday parking permit at risk.
Residents will still be required to buy per-
mits — which cost about $50 each —  to sell 
parking for the football season.
So far, many residents who sell parking are 
displeased with the new regulations. 
Brianne Bradley, a 20-year-old UF advertis-
ing and marketing junior, said she was shocked 
that the new rules got passed.Parking rules stricter for 2014

you’re not responsible for people if 
they want to give you money to park

UF has chosen a leader for its online 
degree program.
Elizabeth “Betty” Phillips was 
named Friday as the executive director 
of UF’s eCampus (to soon be called UF Online). Phillips comes from Arizona State University, where she is not only the provost but also was instrumental in creating the school’s online degree system.
But Phillips is no stranger to 
Gainesville.
She spent 11 years as a psychol-
ogy professor at UF and three as the school’s provost. She’s also married to Win Phillips, the university’s chief op-erating ofﬁ  cer.
“I am very excited about this oppor-
tunity and thrilled to be coming back to UF,” she wrote in an email. “It is a great university, and we will have a huge impact in the online space.”
UF Online is accepting applications 
now. It should launch with ﬁ  ve bache-lor’s degree programs on Jan. 1, which is also Phillips’ ﬁ  rst ofﬁ  cial day. The ﬁ  rst class of freshmen will start school in Summer.
She said her approach to online 
learning is based on experimentation, research and innovation.UF Online director namedLOCAL

As UF Student Government political parties 
ﬁ  nished registering Friday, students interested 
in running as a candidate for the Fall 2013 elec-tions can begin qualifying today.
Because Fall elections are based on location 
rather than classiﬁ  cation as in the Spring, stu-dents who choose to run as a candidate for a Student Senate district seat must provide one of the following to qualify for the district they seek to represent: certiﬁ  ed mail delivered by postal service, Alachua County voter registra-tion card, original copy of lease, original copy of utility bill or cable bill prior to qualifying, original copy of promissory note or lease from fraternity or sorority house, original copy of homeowner’s insurance or an original copy of warranty deed.
Students can qualify to be a candidate in 
Rooms 361, 362 and 363 in the Reitz Union from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. today, Tuesday and Wednes-day, according to Supervisor of Elections Justin Hoover.
After a student qualiﬁ  es, he or she may 
choose to run, or slate, with a political party. Slating for the Students Party will take place in Reitz Union Rooms 346 and 347 from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. and for the Swamp Party in Room 349 from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m today through Wednes-day.
Students may also run as an independent 
candidate.
Students Party Campaign Manager Helie 
Dharia said the party will look to ﬁ  ll all 50 seats. The party will announce its slate by midnight Wednesday.
Dharia said the party is looking for qualiﬁ  ed 
students who are driven, active on campus and familiar with the party.
“We don’t take anything else into consider-
ation,” she said. “We pick them solely on their qualiﬁ  cations.”
Joey Michaels, Swamp Party spokesman, 
said his party aims to have a full slate with qualiﬁ  ed candidates from a variety of loca-tions. 
Candidates will be notiﬁ  ed by midnight 
Wednesday.
“The Swamp Party wants to ensure that stu-
dents of all locations are represented as best as possible,” he said.SG starts election slating today

Quality Certiﬁ  cation Services, a 
Gainesville-based USDA organic certi-
ﬁ  er, received ofﬁ  cial approval from the Global Partnership of Good Agriculture Practices last month.
This approval allows QCS to better 
serve producers and participants in the market chain to meet food safety, ethi-cal and sustainable consumer demands, said Jenni Williams, communication di-rector for Florida Organic Growers.
QCS is the ﬁ  rst U.S.-based certiﬁ  er to 
receive global G.A.P. Agriculture, Com-pound Feed Manufacturing and Chain of Custody scopes approval.
“So many things say ‘all natural’ or 
‘no pesticides used,’ but they aren’t or-ganic. So, it’s very misleading, but when Gainesville can certify the sources it makes me a lot more comfortable,” said Roselyn Byrd, a 19-year-old UF sustain-ability sophomore.
This new certiﬁ  cation also effects the 
city of Gainesville as a whole.
“Having a world-renowned organic 
certiﬁ  cation agency in Gainesville brings added exposure and promotion of or-ganic certiﬁ  cation,” Williams said.
QCS, which is located downtown, 
certiﬁ  es more than 800 clients in 37 states and 11 countries. It is also an accredited certiﬁ  cation program that offers options for farming, livestock, packing, handling, processing and wild harvest operations.
Though organic food tends to be more 
expensive, students aren’t discouraged.
“More labeling helps people make 
better eating choices, but a lot of UF stu-dents can’t afford it,” Byrd said. “The health of my body doesn’t have a price cap.”Gainesville organic group

A sandwich restaurant boasting 
56 trillion possible sandwich combi-
nations is coming to town.
Which Wich will open in Butler 
Plaza on Archer Road in October.
Customers can choose from more 
than 50 variations of customized sandwiches including the signature Wicked sandwich, loaded with tur-key, ham, roast beef, pepperoni and bacon. Most cost less than $10. 
To place an order, guests use Sharpies to mark up pre-printed bags. They select a protein category and then choose bread, cheese and other toppings.
Kristin Mamula, a spokeswoman 
for Butler Enterprises, said the res-taurant will be a good fit for the dy-namics of the area. 
“Butler Plaza wanted to intro-
duce Gainesville to this fast and ca-sual restaurant with a unique dining experience,” she said. “The addition of Which Wich follows our strategy of bringing many new-to-the-mar-ket restaurants and shops.”
Hala Habal, the communications 
manager for Which Wich, said the chain has an advantage because of the options. 
“The things that make us unique 
are the selection of various toppings and ingredients that we offer, the customization, our bag and the or-dering system,” she said. 
Which Wich has franchises in 37 
states. The Gainesville franchise will be the sixth location in Florida.
“We are growing rapidly,” Habal 
said. “We just started our interna-tional expansion as well.”
Alicia Lew, a 21-year-old UF biol-
ogy senior, said she would be open to eating at the shop.
“I’m always interested when I 
hear of new restaurants opening around town,” she said.4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 2013

Grooveshark, a free online-radio music service based in 
Gainesville, has dealt with major legal troubles throughout 
the last year. 
However, the company recently reached a settlement with 
Sony/ATV Music Publishing to secure the publishing rights to a massive catalog of music.
Josh Greenberg, co-founder of Grooveshark, said everyone 
at the company is excited to have come to an agreement with Sony/ATV.
Greenberg said the agreement with Sony/ATV and 
the recent agreement with EMI music publishing gives Grooveshark rights to distribute more music to its users.
Cody Romano, a 23-year-old UF alumnus and former 
Grooveshark intern, said during his time with the company they worked hard to avoid breaches in copyright agreements.
“I would say that I’m really happy about (the agreement) 
because Grooveshark was kind of picked on a little bit on copyright in a way that they didn’t deserve,” Romano said.
The company’s main focus isn’t necessarily to provide 
popular music to the masses, but to work with independent musicians and allow them to post their music for free, Greenberg said.
Greenberg and Romano compared Grooveshark to 
YouTube.
“It is most similar to YouTube, in the sense that both 
services are free to users, and are monetized primarily through ads,” Greenberg said.Grooveshark settles

Phillips will receive advice from state-appointed advisory board
“By using technology, each student can be taught as an in-
dividual by many different people who provide material in 
many different formats,” Phillips said. “This can be much bet-ter for many students than a one-size-fits-all lecture.”
Her sentiments of increasing access echo those made by UF 
President Bernie Machen at his state of the university speech late last month. 
“I would like to extend education to large numbers of stu-
dents and to allow as many qualified students as possible the opportunity to obtain a UF degree,” she said.
Phillips said she hopes to create online engineering degree 
programs at UF. Overall, though, she wants to research ways to use technology to improve instruction.
“To me, online is not a lesser form of teaching, but a newer 
form and one that will change and develop in the future in ways we cannot see,” she said. “I would like to help UF and the faculty here be the leaders of that improved teaching envi-ronment that will extend access to education across the globe in ways we can only start to imagine.”
Phillips will report directly to UF’s provost, said Associate 
Provost for Teaching and Technology Andy McCollough. She will receive advice and suggestions from a state-appointed advisory board, which includes John Rood, Carlos Alfonso, Ernie Friend and John Watret.
“We’re certainly glad to get all the help we can get, and 
Betty Phillips will be a great deal of help,” McCollough said.OnLine , from page 1The rules are supposed to stop extreme gameday behavior 
“I think it’s ridiculous because you’re not responsible for 
people if they want to give you money to park there,” she said. 
“Especially if you have a permit that allows people to pay to keep their cars there.”
Bradley said she doubts the law will be enforced properly.“They’d make an example out of one person and try to deter 
people from doing it with that,” she said.
Ashley Lindenberg, a 22-year-old UF accounting graduate 
student who began selling parking at her house this year, said it could make gameday parking more difficult.  “It’s not realistic to expect students to be 
able to enforce that law,” she said. “Personal property shouldn’t be subject to that kind of regulation. It could complicate gameday parking and hurt students looking to earn money in a way that only benefits the com-munity.”
While some residents don’t think the rules 
can benefit them, Commissioner Thomas 
Hawkins said there are a couple of advan-
tages to the new regulations and gameday activities should not be affected by the new rules.“With the new regulations, we matched the permit cycle 
to football season, and that will save folks a lot of money,” he said. “I love gameday Saturdays, and this is no attempt to stop tailgating. But it does make the neighborhoods safer and better for folks.” 
Hawkins said that the rules are meant to regulate over-the-
top gameday behavior, such as public urination, late-night partying that disturbs neighbors and portable toilets that sit in yards for the entire football season.
“There’s a couple examples of really egregious behavior,” 
he said. “We identified those as extreme behavior and tried to write rules that wouldn’t affect the vast majority of folks.”

A year after an ailing aircraft struck the supporting cables 
of the old broadcast tower, the new WUFT started operating at full power. The 869-foot tower took over from the temporary tower WUFT had been using, and it re-extended service to the other half of the area the temporary tower couldn’t reach. The new tower would improve reception for local public television viewers. 
Sep. 9, 1987Papers and tempers flew when students faced losing finan-
cial aid due to disorganized offices. UF Financial Aid Director Doug Turner said he wasn’t sure how many of the 15,000 fi-nancial aid recipients would pay the price for the lost forms but another aid employee estimated one in 100 students would end up short changed. With half a million forms going through the mail room, Turner said it was realistic forms would go to the wrong division. 
Sep. 11, 1998Freshmen and transfer students were left wanting in Gator 
Chomps and sunburns. As student enrollment increased far past the occupancy of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, season passes typically sold out before new students were given the opportu-nity to apply for them. University Athletic Association Director Jeremy Foley wasn’t sure how they would handle the dilemma, but three-game ticket packages and the ticket lottery were being discussed as options.
Sep. 11, 2006In remembrance of  9/11, members of various student groups 
on campus erected a “good deed wall” on Turlington Plaza. Participants wrote down a deed they planned to perform on a piece of paper and then attached it to the wall with a picture of a 9/11 victim. Rabbi Berl Goldman said, “We did this with a hope that these universal acts of hope and kindness will collectively transform this dark day of 9/11 unto positive energy.”

With the 12th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist at-
tacks approaching, a UF graduate has written an e-book 
on how American baseball became an outlet for grief.
UF alumnus Patrick Carney released “Baseball after 
9/11: Six Nights That Helped Heal America,” on Ama-zon on Tuesday. Carney said baseball could be a heal-ing process for those who have lost loved ones.
The e-book is available exclusively online for $2.99. 
The Kindle app is free and open to download on any computer, tablet or smartphone.
The e-book explains six different nights in ballparks 
around the country in a post-Sept. 11 world, where there was debate on whether to resume playing base-ball, Carney said.
The book includes moments like the game-winning 
home run by Mike Piazza 10 days after Sept. 11, Presi-dent George W. Bush’s first pitch at the 2001 World Se-ries and crowd chanting U-S-A in Philadelphia on the night Osama bin Laden was announced killed 10 years later. 
“Baseball allowed people to focus on the positive 
through all the nonstop coverage in the news,” Carney said.
Breanne Woods said baseball is America’s pastime 
and it gave people something to look forward to.
“I feel this book is very inspirational because it shows 
how baseball helped America keep moving,” said the 21-year-old UF psychology senior. 
A portion of the proceeds will be donated to Tues-

“Writing the book was exciting and fun for me, but 
I also wanted it to have some meaning as well,” said Carney.UF alumnus releases baseball bookASHLEY CRANE

When the Main Street fire sta-
tion expands one block south, it 
will crowd out some members of the growing art community who currently rent buildings on the land, but some artists are remain-ing optimistic.
The City Commission voted 
to approve the fire station’s move from 427 S. Main St. in August, citing outdated and deteriorating facilities. 
The fire station construction will 
affect The Church of Holy Colors, The Repurpose Project, Gainesville Compost and Every Man Sound, among others.
Building plans for the relocated 
station are pending results from environmental tests of the land.
After almost a year of negotia-
tions, the city agreed to grant use of the land to current tenants until December 2014.
So for the time being, creative 
operations on South Main Street are projected to continue as usual.
Inside the painted wooden 
walls of The Church of Holy Col-ors, two artists with studio space in the building described the year ahead.
Tristan Whitehill, a musician 
who has called the space home for about three years, said that The Church of Holy Colors will use its time left to focus more on visual art.
“It sucks that 
this will kind of be an end to an era,” he said. “But at least with this, there’s a sense of clo-sure.”
Over the hum 
of an old over-
head projector, visual artist Benji Haselhurst said, “This isn’t going to shut anything down. It’s just a stumbling block.” 
Sarah Goff, co-founder of The 
Repurpose Project, said she’s keep-ing a positive perspective.
“Sometimes something seems 
like a bad thing but can lead to something better, and that’s just how I look at it,” she said.
Christopher Fillie, who rented 
and subleased part of the affected land, said The Repurpose Project began outgrowing the space within the first year and expected a sched-uled raise in rent on Jan. 1.
Fillie said he views the city al-
lowing the artists to stay until 2014 as  “a nod to our efforts for revital-izing the area.”
He said that current tenants 
should no longer see a rise in rent or be forced out early for expired leases.
With the extra time, Fillie said 
he plans on continuing to build Vibrant Community Development Inc., a nonprofit aimed at helping small businesses and artists stay afloat.
“I’m trying to create an engine 
to leverage the forced appreciation of property that comes with the creative class,” he said.
In the negotiations, the city also 
agreed to provide public parking for the affected establishments.
For now, Haselhurst said, the 
group of artists is just curious about what the future holds for them and their businesses.
“I’m very confident it will find 
us all working and playing in very close proximity to one another,” he said. “We inspire each other, and I think it’s just obvious that we stick together.”

On Tuesday from 2:30 until 4:30 
p.m., the Health Science Center Li-
braries will be hosting Collaborat-ing with Strangers on Sex and Gen-der Differences in Health, a CoLAB geared toward developing cross-disciplinary conversations and so-lutions for health sciences.
“In a year, you may have 12 con-versations with someone you don’t know. With a coLAB, you can have 12 to 17 conversations in a matter of two hours,” said Bess de Farber, grants manager for the Smathers Libraries.
Participants fill out a profile 
board with personal information that they wear throughout the night. Having the boards facilitates better discussion, she said.
In three-minute increments, par-
ticipants go around and meet differ-ent people and talk about sex and gender differences, de Farber said.
“I call it speed-meeting,” she said. 
Participants are UF faculty, staff 
and students from all colleges and departments on campus.
“Many students came away with 
potential mentors or internships, and faculty left with new collabora-tors on their research, regardless of discipline,” said Hannah Norton, reference and liaison librarian for the Health Science Center Librar-ies.
Collaborating with Strangers 
on Sex and Gender Differences in Health will be in the McKnight Brain Institute, Room L6-110 A/B.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFriday’s question: Have you taken What 
is the Good Life?  Today’s question: Do you buy organic food? NSA spying offers chance to change habits
If you’re reading this, chances are pretty good that 
you have an account on Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, Tumblr, Foursquare or some sort of social media 
platform. You probably post pictures, update your sta-tus, “check-in” at certain locations and play hours of mobile games connected to your social network. 
Over the past several months, the National Security 
Agency — NSA — has found its way into the news. Numerous reports revealed the NSA is spending a vast majority of its time spying on average Americans and not focusing all of its energy on ﬁ  nding bad guys. 
Americans have every right to be angry with the 
NSA and any other government agency intruding into our personal lives. It’s wrong, immoral, unnecessary and downright scary, but aren’t we being hypocritical if we voluntarily post information about ourselves on the Internet for all to see?
Yes, the NSA went far beyond any reasonable limit 
when they accessed emails and phone calls of average Americans, but that doesn’t mean we can’t call our own digital habits into question.
It’s not just college kids posting pictures of them-
selves wasted at a tailgate or teenagers sexting: People of all ages are ﬁ  nding out there are serious consequenc-es for web-documented misbehaviors.
Consider this: Former Congressman — and current 
New York City mayoral candidate — Anthony Weiner saw his rising political career crash into the rocks, all because he enjoyed sending crotch shots to people over the Web.
When it was recently revealed that Weiner continued 
sharing lewd photos online after the derailment of his congressional career, his hopes of being mayor of New York City followed a similar path.  
Even when you delete that incriminating picture or 
apply the strongest security measures on your web-based life, the information is still stored on a server somewhere. And whether it’s the NSA, a potential employer, the media or even your mom, someone has the potential to ﬁ  nd out everything you never want publicly revealed.
Don’t believe me? Consider Rutgers Univer-
sity students Dharun Ravi and 
Molly Wei, who in 2010 ﬁ  lmed Tyler Clementi — then Ravi’s closeted gay roommate — having sex. Ravi and Wei then posted the video online for all their friends to see. Horriﬁ  ed at the thought of being publicly “outed,” Clementi jumped off the George Washington Bridge to his death. 
Clementi’s death raised awareness of cyberbullying 
and highlighted the effect our digital lives have on oth-ers. It’s heartbreaking that we must see news like the tragedy at Rutgers to demonstrate the spillover effect the Internet has on our real lives. 
In no way am I saying we need to abandon our digital 
lives — or, for that matter, our real lives — and simply live as hermits, but we need to consider the repercus-sions of our actions.
We seldom consider the power we have on others 
through our online personas. It is our responsibility to clean up our act, and not just because the NSA or other government boogeymen are watching, but due to the overwhelming impact the Internet has on us and we over it. 
Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms 
are great ways to share our lives, stay connected with friends and relatives and avoid writing that research paper — but remember the Internet and everything on it is permanent.

paigning. His column runs on Mondays.Live and Let Die: 
Pains of posthumous 
manuscripts
In 2009, Vladimir Nabokov’s son, Dmitri Nabokov, went 
against his father’s dying wish and published the writer’s ﬁ  nal — and unﬁ  nished — novel, “The Original of Laura.”
Nabokov, who died in 1977, had ordered his family to 
destroy the manuscript. As his biographer Brian Boyd ex-plained, Nabokov used a speciﬁ  c technique when crafting manuscripts: He would envision a novel in his mind, from start to ﬁ  nish, and then begin the laborious task of transfer-ring parts of his mental narrative on a series of 3-by-5 cards. This tactic allowed him to edit particular sections and rear-range the chronology with ease.
In the case of “Laura,” though, the cards only amounted to 
about 45 printed pages. Calling the novel “unﬁ  nished” is an embarrassing understatement — it’s hardly surprising that he didn’t want that particular novel disseminated. Yet his son released it anyway as part of a stunt that was supposed to be the “literary event of 2009.” The whole ordeal really just smacked of greed on Nabokov’s son’s part.
However, recent reports of soon-to-be-released posthu-
mous work by the famously reclusive J.D. Salinger, who died in 2010, seem to be fueled not by family greed, but by pushy researchers.
A new biography about J.D. Salinger, titled “Salinger,” 
by David Shields and Shane Salerno was recently released. The book was written in conjunction with a documentary by the same name, which has been in production for the past 10 years and is comprised of more than 150 interviews with Salinger’s lovers, colleagues, fans and friends.
Shields and Salerno claimed Salinger left instructions on a 
speciﬁ  c timetable for the release of his unpublished work be-tween 2015 and 2020. The unreleased stories reportedly revisit the lives of some of Salinger’s well-known characters — yes, including everyone’s favorite screwup, Holden Caulﬁ  eld.
However, the Salinger estate — run partly by Matt Salin-
ger and Salinger’s widow, Colleen O’Neill — didn’t cooper-ate with Shields and Salerno and haven’t commented on the reports of upcoming Salinger ﬁ  ction.
In the unfolding case of Salinger’s posthumous work, we 
see a different type of greed — two manic Salinger fans will-ing to sacriﬁ  ce the author’s wishes and integrity in order to catch a glimpse at work that probably wasn’t meant, as in the case of “The Original Laura,” for public consumption.
The documentary has already received a scathing New 
York Times review. Critic A.O. Scott called it a blend of “rev-erence and character assassination” and an “almost perfect distillation of the modern pathology of fame.”
As for posthumous work, it seems the literary world hasn’t 
learned the “don’t-milk-a-dead-cow” lesson.
Betty Eppes, who interviewed Salinger in 1980, told NPR, 
“He said, ‘I refuse to publish . . . When you publish, the world thinks you owe something. If you don’t publish, they don’t know what you’re doing. You can keep it for yourself.’”

In your time at UF, you’ll spend 
$2,082 on Student Government. Shouldn’t you have a say on how 
it’s spent?
You’ll have 
the opportunity to slate for the Student Sen-ate this week, from today through Wednesday. As a student senator, you’ll have the power to positively impact your campus, im-prove student life and make a differ-ence.  
If you decide to come out to the Re-
itz Union and slate, you’ll see a sharp contrast between the two political par-ties on campus.  
On one side, the Swamp Party will 
provide more of the same: rising fees and few results. On the other, you’ll get real change and real results from the Students Party. 
The Students is committed to mak-
ing Student Government fair, account-able and inclusive. We’re the party that truly represents the diversity of our student body. Republicans, Democrats and Independents have come together to make sure every Gator has a voice.
This election and this university are 
too important for anyone to sit on the sidelines. I hope you’ll choose to join the new leadership of the Students to continue to move this campus forward. SG ought to be a nonpartisan organiza-tion with the sole purpose of improv-ing student services. Instead, we’ve got incompetence and inefﬁ  ciency: $45,000 of your money unnecessarily thrown away on a concert that never hap-pened, ineffective crony appointments, the university’s reputation jeopardized and student services gutted. 
All students at this university pay 
into SG. All students should have the same access to it. All students should receive the same beneﬁ  ts from it, and all students should be represented by it. This is your chance to take a stand and make a difference. SG can change. It can be forced to put the interests of students ﬁ  rst.  
But it can only happen if you exer-
cise the ultimate power you have over government: the ballot box. 
When elected, the Students will cut 
waste, end corruption, restore ﬁ  scal sanity and fund vital student services. While some in SG are sure to put their own political ambitions ahead of deliv-ering for our university, the Students will always put students ﬁ  rst. 
It’s time we have a student gov-
ernment that is worthy of serving the Gator Nation. If you want to learn more about our party, please visit www.stu-dentspartyuf.com, or you can check us out on Facebook at www.facebook.com/ufstudentsparty.

Speaking OutOn July 13, I, along with 
millions of Ameri-cans, watched the 
George Zimmerman trial end with a not-guilty verdict. 
A jury of six women en-
tered the Sanford courtroom and handed over the verdict, their eyes averted from the defendant. After hours of deliberation, they decided Zimmerman had justiﬁ  ably used deadly force against Trayvon Mar-tin — enough to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm, as the Florida self-defense law stipulates.
I ﬂ  ipped through the local and na-
tional news shortly after 10 that night, hoping that changing the channel would somehow change the reality. I asked my-self how Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Mar-tin would cope with the release of their son’s killer.
The gavel went down, and the case 
closed. The defendant and jury were dis-missed, and the reporters went home. What was left from one of the most pub-licized court cases in history was Mar-tin’s memory, and he would become the face of injustice.
Martin, a teenager from Miami Gar-
dens — who was usually portrayed by the media as a young black man who liked to get gas station snacks, wear his hoodie up and talk on the phone while he wan-dered suburban streets — was deemed the aggressor in a trial that claimed not to use the Stand Your Ground law as a principle argument. People were out-raged.
The night of the verdict, thinking the 
worst, I believed the outraged people would channel their frustration together on the street. I turned off the news and grabbed my keys, a recorder and a hoodie. Ten minutes down the road, I was in Mi-ami Gardens, the neighbor-hood where Trayvon Martin grew up, went to school and hung out with his friends. 
I stopped in front of a fast-
food joint where I thought I 
saw some teenagers gathering — the lo-cal news trucks were out there, too, wait-ing for something to happen. I joined the kids on the curb, blending in as a youth on the street rather than a reporter wait-ing for something to happen. 
Eleizer Solis and his friends were sim-
ply on break from their shift at Wendy’s. They wanted to remain inconspicuous, due to the impending Trayvon Martin verdict. Solis, an 18-year-old who went to the same high school as Martin, was working late and hadn’t seen the trial’s end. When I told him, he looked sad, but not surprised. 
Although the Dream Defenders did 
their best in the following weeks to sit in at the capitol and urge Rick Scott to call a special legislative session to review Stand Your Ground, a state task force has recommended not to repeal the law, even though states with such a law have  higher homicide rates. 
Sadly, but not surprisingly, cases like 
Martin’s  show that Florida’s law is a “last man standing” escape route, allow-ing the armed — and living — defendant to escape long-term consequence.
No one will know exactly what hap-
pened on Feb. 26, 2012. Anyone can ar-gue the necessity or proportionality of Martin and Zimmerman’s struggle and still be left with questions. Earlier this week, I tried to quell some of my doubts about Stand Your Ground with a lawyer who specializes in Florida’s gun laws. 
Eric Friday, who delivered a guest 
lecture at a UF public relations class last Tuesday, is a self-defense attorney and lead counsel for state gun rights group, Florida Carry. 
His explanation of the Zimmerman 
trial conﬁ  rmed what I saw in Solis’ eyes in July: Trayvon Martin had been a vic-tim of a system much bigger than just pure common sense. 
Friday talked about how meeting 
force with force was legal under certain circumstances, in which a “law-abiding, armed citizen” can kill someone if they think that someone is going to commit a felony against them. He explained how the Stand Your Ground law was made in 2005, but the tenets of self-defense come from common law — the British system of law that the American forefathers used to create our justice system.
Immunity by way of violence is com-
pletely backward in today’s society, and this outdated legislation is part of the problem. I like to believe Martin didn’t die in vain. His death and the verdict of his killer are urging more people to back efforts by legislators to amend or re-peal Stand Your Ground. Just last week, Florida Senate Democratic Leader Chris Smith ﬁ  led his proposition to amend it for the second year in a row. 
Friday made another point during his 
chat at UF last week. He said that histori-cally, judges have always found life to be something of value. 
I couldn’t agree more — it’s the law 
that has to change to make our lives less vulnerable to unjust death.

Seeing an 8-foot-long female python sit-
ting in the middle of the road took one UF 
student by surprise during his summer in Swaziland.
Experiences like UF student Cody God-
win’s could be the reason “Popular Science” ranked UF’s monthlong summer wildlife ecology and conservation program in Swa-ziland sixth in the top 10 “most awesome” college labs of 2013.
Godwin, 24, a senior wildlife ecology and 
conservation major, said he will never for-get his close encounter with a white rhino.
“We were working on grids to trap ro-
dents, and I look up and see a white rhino looking at us, looking at him,” he said.Robert McCleery, the wildlife ecology 
and conservation assistant professor that runs the program, said he believes “Popular Science” picked his course because of the adventurous appeal of Africa.
“They were looking for things that un-
dergraduates would do that would be excit-ing, but maybe a little scary,” he said.
John Hayes, the dean for research and 
director of the Florida Agricultural Experi-ment Station, has spent time with McCleery and students in Swaziland.
“I am excited that Dr. McCleery’s pro-
gram in Swaziland received this recogni-tion, but I’m not surprised,” he said.
For McCleery and Godwin, the adven-
ture is not what they find awesome about Swaziland. Because Swazis, the native people of Swaziland, are very diverse and friendly, McCleery said the 12 to 15 UF stu-dents he takes on the trip enjoy the culture as well.
“No one walks past another person 
without engaging,” he said. “It’s the in-terpersonal relationships that sometimes we’re missing in our everyday lives here in America. It can sometimes become difficult to come home and walk on campus and just walk by people.”
He said the connection with the Swazi 
people makes the program such a great ex-perience.
Although Godwin did not become fluent 
in Swazi, one word stuck out to him.
“Nkhosi, that’s the word for friend,” 
Godwin said. “Swazis are the friendliest people I ever met. Everyone looks out for everyone.”

KEYSTONE HEIGHTS — Rescued a 
month before it was scheduled to be scrapped, 
a Hubble replica from the Houston NASA fa-cility is now being bolted back together at an airport about 40 minutes from Gainesville.
The disassembled walls of a metal cylin-
der, about 6-feet high, stand alongside a Key-stone Heights Airport landing strip. How the pieces got there is a story Robert Oehl enjoys telling.
Oehl, the director of Wings of Dreams 
Aviation Museum based at the airport, said the equipment was found outside of a NASA storage unit in Houston.
It was a full-scale model of the Hubble 
Space Telescope used to train astronauts for missions. 
The museum’s co-founder, Susan King, 
proceeded to go through the steps to convince NASA to allow the museum to take the mock-up. Five months later, she was told the piece would be transferred to the museum if they could cover transportation and reassembly.
That’s when nearby Davis Express stepped 
in to help get it there.
King also wrote to NASA and received a 
fully funded grant to aid in the museum’s ed-ucation outreach. According to Oehl, UF also donated a telescope for the museum’s newest program.
Getting the telescope mock-up and other 
pieces for the space exploration exhibit was a landmark, Oehl said, because NASA has never worked with an all-volunteer nonprofit organization before.  
“There are certain people at NASA who look at us and call us the ‘mouse that roared’ because it’s the great underdog story of the little guy,” he said. 
Although still disassembled, the mockup 
was opened for public viewing Friday. The way the mockup will be displayed is being discussed, but it will not be the focus of the collection of space program artifacts. It’s just one piece.
“I think that it’s just great that they have 
a vision and a dream to bring something of that magnitude to Keystone,” said Buck Burney, a local pilot.
The museum is in the planning stage of 
its new facility’s construction on the airport’s property. 
The space exploration exhibit is one of the 
projects the museum and its board of volun-teers is putting together. 
It also has an expansive World War II col-
lection. Oehl said the focus of the collection is on “highlighting actual people, specifically people that did really important things… the story of real heroes.”
“Our mission started out commemorating 
‘the greatest generation,’ which is a term I use lightly,” Oehl said, “and the second move-ment was education, of course with the mu-seum, and the third, the space program. Now what we need is funding and awareness to protect all of this.”Keystone airport displays

� THE CARDS COST $10.
MICHELLE CHAMPALANNE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students looking to save a few 
extra bucks at Bento and other local 
businesses now can with the release of Campus Rewards, a discount card to current UF students. 
The card, released last week, of-
fers exclusive discounts to members and allows student organizations to register and raise profits by selling cards.
“You can support a good cause 
just by buying these cards,” said creator and co-founder Karthik Sha-nadi.
Shanadi partnered with Luke 
McGurrin and former UF student Luke Sipka this past summer to cre-ate Campus Rewards, and are also part of Starter Space, an incubator space in downtown Gainesville that launched two weeks ago.The card features 15 local ven-
dors, which vary from 101 Can-tina to Study Edge. The company is  working to include more businesses and update its website with new of-fers, Shanadi said.
“We all wanted to think of a new 
way to fundraise and give back value to those who donated,” said McGurrin, a 22-year-old finance se-nior.
A one-time use of all the dis-
counts lets users save about $270, Shanadi said. But unlike other pop-ular coupon books like Gator Green-backs, most of Campus Rewards’ discounts are reusable until its expi-ration in December 2013. 
“It’s basically a rewards program 
just for being a student,” said Shana-di, a 21-year-old food and resource economics senior.
The cards are $10 and released 
by semester. Membership requires a valid UFID.
Students interested in purchas-ing a card can order online or stop by Chain Reaction Bike Shop or New Scooters 4 Less.
Organizations can sign up online 
to receive cards on consignment and sell as fundraising. Half of the prof-its go back to organizations.
“As students from UF, we’ve 
all been there,” Shanadi said. “We know how frustrating it can get to raise money for philanthropies. We just want to support student organi-zations.”

MIAMI GARDENS — With the 
Gators trailing late in the fourth quarter 
against Miami on Saturday, Jeff Driskel found Solomon Patton in the end zone for a 21-yard touchdown.
The score was not enough to com-
plete the comeback — No. 18 Florida (1-1) fell 21-16 to No. 15 Miami (2-0) in Sun Life Stadium — but it capped a career day for Patton, who has become one of UF’s most consistent offensive playmak-ers through two games this season.
Patton ﬁ  nished the game with six 
catches for a team-leading 118 yards and a touchdown. Prior to Saturday, his ca-reer high for receiving yards was 27 set during Florida’s 55-14 victory against Vanderbilt in 2010.
“Solomon’s had a really good camp,” 
coach Will Muschamp said after the game. “He’s played well.”
Added Driskel: “He’s a guy that is 
going to have to play well for us this year, and he has so far.”
Patton was in the process of develop-
ing into a signiﬁ  cant contributor to the Gators’ offense in 2012.
In the ﬁ  rst year of offensive coordina-
tor Brent Pease’s system, Patton, who UF has utilized heavily in the speed sweep, carried the ball 14 times for 140 yards. He also added one catch for 17 yards.
But his season ended in the ﬁ  rst quar-
ter of Florida’s 17-9 loss to Georgia on Oct. 27 in Jacksonville.

When coach Will Muschamp 
addressed the media fol-lowing Florida’s 21-16 
loss to Miami on Saturday, there was one group that he singled out — the defense.
A reporter said the defense 
played well enough to win, and 
Muschamp said he was “disap-pointed early.”
He harped 
on two drives in the ﬁ  rst quarter  where the defense al-lowed Miami to score.
When an-
other reporter said the defense kept them in the game, he said, “That’s their job.”
Florida’s defense was not the rea-
son Gators fans needed to make the ﬁ  ve-hour drive back to Gainesville upset.
The blame lies squarely on the 
offense.
Florida’s defense had a rough 
start, but it stepped up time and time again throughout the second half to give the offense an opportunity to put the game away. It couldn’t.
In the second and third quarters, 
the Gators forced four straight three-and-outs. What did the offense have to show for it? Three points.
Florida got inside Miami’s 20-
yard line seven times on Saturday and failed to score four times.
The ﬁ  rst time the Gators scored 
in the red zone, it was because of a stellar special teams play, not the offense’s prowess. Defensive back Loucheiz Purifoy blocked a punt to start Florida’s drive at the 9-yard line. All quarterback Jeff Driskel needed to do was scamper about 30 feet into the end zone to get the Gators on the board.
The second time Florida scored a 
touchdown from the red zone came late in the fourth quarter when the game was effectively over.
That’s on the offense.Driskel threw those two intercep-
tions, not Ronald Powell. Driskel’s second interception was — to use a bad cliché — the straw that broke Blame loss

The Gators upset No. 2 Stan-
ford on Saturday, but their luck 
came to an end against No. 1 Penn State on Sunday after they were swept 25–18, 25–17, 25–20.  
The Nittany Lions proved to 
be too much for eighth-ranked Florida after giving the Gators some of their biggest deﬁ  cits of the season. PSU racked up leads of seven and eight points during the game.
“It was a great experience 
for our team to play Penn State, who has been amongst the elite for the last several years,” coach Mary Wise said.  “They were an elite team today. The separator was the serve-pass game, and they were outstanding today. 
“It was a great learning expe-
rience for us and we’ll be better from it.”
Florida got solid efforts out 
of a few players but struggled to get any type of streak going against the Nittany Lions.  
Florida had its worst hitting 
output of the season with only 34 kills and a .194 hitting per-centage. UF also had 16 attack errors and only one service ace, compared to PSU’s 12 attack er-rors and nine 
service aces. 
The Gators 
have won most of their matches this season with  high hitting percentages 
and solid defense — both were  lacking on Sunday.  The Gators also had nine reception errors while the Nittany Lions only had one.  
“We approached this week-
end like all of our preseason tournaments where you learn about players you don’t play on a regular basis,” Wise said.  “The turnaround in this tourna-ment is so fast. 
“It’s something we don’t 
have to face in the [Southeastern Conference], because the teams are so familiar with each other. All four non-conference week-ends really do prepare us for postseason when you’re learn-ing about players for the ﬁ  rst time.”
It was a rough outing for al-
most all of the Gators’ starters.  The few bright spots for Florida were senior middle back Chloe Mann and sophomore setter

Landon Watnick/Alligator StaffFirst of ﬁ  ve turnovers occurred on Gators’ opening drive 
Miami linebacker Denzel Perry-
man separated Jones from the ball 
on the sophomore running back’s third carry of the game, setting up the Hurricanes’ ﬁ  rst touchdown drive.
“We need to hold onto the ball,” 
Muschamp said. “It was a good tackle on their part. He put his hat on the ball. We’ve given Matt plenty of contact going into that situation. That was a good hit on their part.”
After Miami turned the Jones 
fumble into a nine-play, 50-yard touchdown drive, Loucheiz Purifoy — returning after a one-game sus-pension — helped the Gators regain momentum on the Hurricanes’ next drive.
Purifoy blocked a punt deep 
in Miami territory, setting up the Gators offense at the 9-yard line. Driskel put UF on the board two plays later with a 9-yard touchdown run.
But then the mistakes continued. Instead of kicking the extra point 
to tie the game, Muschamp chose to attempt a two-point conversion and failed. The try failed, keeping Flori-da behind.
“That’s a situation where we had 
the look we wanted,” Muschamp said. “If we block it right, we’re go-ing to get two points. We just didn’t block it right. I’d do it again. There was a lot of football to play in that situation.”
Momentum shifted, and the 
Gators offense ﬁ  nished the ﬁ  rst half with three drives ending on an inter-ception at the Hurricanes’ 11-yard-line, a turnover on downs and a lost fumble by Trey Burton 13 yards away from the goal line.
Those drives were three of Flori-
da’s four best on the day in terms of length, totaling 54, 56 and 66 yards, respectively.
The turnover on downs occurred 
at Miami’s 16-yard-line. Muschamp elected to go for the ﬁ  rst down on fourth-and-1 rather than let fresh-man kicker Austin Hardin attempt a ﬁ  eld goal. Driskel took the snap under center and was stuffed on a quarterback sneak.
“We had conﬁ  dence in our O-line 
that we could get a push,” Driskel said. “On that play, Miami did a great job of really stufﬁ  ng every hole. Sometimes the defense beats you.”
UF ﬁ  nally lit up the scoreboard 
again in the third, trimming the deﬁ  cit to 14-9 on a 33-yard ﬁ  eld goal by Hardin. But the Gators offense quickly returned to sputtering, punt-ing on the following three drives.
Meanwhile, the Florida defense 
bent but rarely broke. However, a forgettable ﬁ  rst quarter was too much for the Gators to overcome.
UF surrendered 14 points and 
143 yards on 18 ﬁ  rst-quarter plays. The biggest blow was a 52-yard touchdown pass from Stephen Mor-ris to Phillip Dorsett that upped Mi-ami’s early lead to 14-6.
“Gave them a big play,” Mus-
champ said. “You give a team belief. Certainly, that’s what we did defen-sively early.”
The Gators shut down the Hur-
ricanes the rest of the way, giving up only 69 yards on the home team’s ﬁ  nal 35 snaps. Florida forced seven three-and-out possessions and held Miami to 1 of 11 on third-down con-versions.
“That’s their job,” Muschamp 
said of the Gators’ defense. “Re-gardless of the situation, they need to play well. We expect that. I’m just very disappointed in the way we started the game.”
After playing more than two 
quarters with a one-score deﬁ  cit, cornerback Vernon Hargreaves III gave the Gators an extra boost. The freshman made his second intercep-tion in as many weeks, putting UF in UM territory at the 47-yard-line.
Hargreaves looked like he might 
take the ball all the way back for a touchdown, but he stepped slightly out of bounds on the left sideline while cutting across the ﬁ  eld.
Unfortunately for the Gators, 
the pick was for naught as Driskel threw his second interception ﬁ  ve plays later with Florida again in the red zone at Miami’s 17-yard-line.
“The mistakes were costly,” 
Driskel said. “Where we were with the ball is what made them so costly. Got to be smarter with the ball in the red zone.”
Although the onus fell on Driskel 
in the public eye, Burton, who was responsible for one of Florida’s three fumbles, took the blame for the sec-ond interception.
“I think I might’ve clogged it up, 
because I ran the wrong route,” Bur-ton said. “I’m not too sure. It’s my fault I ran the wrong route.”
The Gators had another chance to notch the go-ahead score on their next possession, but Driskel com-mitted Florida’s ﬁ  fth turnover of the day when he fumbled while being sacked by Miami’s Tyriq McCord. The ‘Canes made it a two-score game two plays later.
“I was careless with the ball,” 
Driskel said. “A couple of intercep-tions, putting the ball on the ground there at the end and a couple of fum-bles. They were costly.”
An inability to ﬁ  nish drives 
marred an otherwise productive day for offensive coordinator Brent Pease’s much-maligned — some say “vanilla” — unit. The Gators amassed 413 yards on 77 plays, con-trolling the football for 38:20.
After racking up nearly 40 min-
utes of possession last Saturday, no team has held the football longer than Florida in 2013. But Saturday’s game was lost in the moments UF could not hang onto the ball.
The season is not lost, but the 
margin of error is slimmer. Each mistake will be more magniﬁ  ed.
“We did some good things at 
times, but bottom line is you can-not continue to shoot yourself in the foot and give somebody else an op-portunity, especially on the road,” Muschamp said. “We certainly did that.”

 Florida’s women’s golf team opened its 
season at the Cougar Classic hosted by College 
of Charleston in Charleston, S.C. on Sunday.
After completing the ﬁ  rst round of the 
three-day tournament, the Gators are sitting eighth on the leaderboard (+3), nine strokes behind leader Mississippi State (-6).
Coach Emily Bastel came into the weekend 
optimistic about her group.
“Our team is excited to head to Charles-
ton,” Bastel said in a release prior to the event. “We take three new players this week, who 
will be gaining valuable experience against a great ﬁ  eld. This event is a great opportunity to test the things we have been working and see how competitive we can be early in the season.”
Yeamans Hall Club, a par-72 course, chal-
lenged a Florida team composed of two fresh-men — Karolina Vlckova and Maria Tor-res; sophomore Katie Mitchell;  junior Anna Young, who shot 18-over par at the tourna-ment last year; and the 2012 Cougar Classic in-dividual champion, junior Camilla Hedberg.
However, Hedberg will need to improve her play during the next two days if she wants a shot at defending her title. 
She ﬁ  nished Sunday’s 
round tied for 47th at 3-over, trailing N.C. State’s Brittany Marchand and Mississippi 
State’s Ally McDonald (-6) by nine strokes.
The highest-ranked 
Gator in individual play was Torres at 2-under par, ﬁ  nishing the ﬁ  rst day in ninth place.
Vlckova and Young are in a 12-way tie for 
26th (+1). Mitchell is tied for 61st at 4-over par.
This tournament carries heavier implica-
tions than a  season opener normally does. UF is one of eight Southeastern Conference schools in a 20-team ﬁ  eld. 
The other SEC teams are Auburn, Missis-
sippi State, Missouri, Ole Miss, Tennessee, South Carolina and LSU.
Today’s ﬁ  rst group will tee off 7:51 a.m., but 
the ﬁ  rst Gators golfer will not hit the course until Mitchell’s 10:15 a.m. tee time
Hedberg tees off at 10:24 a.m., Young at 
10:33 a.m., Vlckova at 10:42 a.m. and Torres at 10:51 a.m. to round out the Gators’ group.

Mann led the Gators with 10 kills 
and had a hitting percentage of .350.  
Mann didn’t get much help from her teammates.
Sophomore outside hitters Ziva 
Recek and Gabby Mallette notched a combined total of only 13 kills. Recek finished with a .250 hitting percent-age, and Mallette ended the day with a -.053 percentage.
Dagostino, who transferred from 
Maryland,  showed why she was brought into the program and helped soften some of the load on senior set-ter Taylor Brauneis.  Dagostino led the Gators with 15 assists and was second on the team with a .333 hit-ting percentage. 
Sunday was the opposite of how 
Florida played against Stanford, when the Gators had a hitting per-centage of .326 and Recek led the team with 19 kills.  
The Gators’ struggles could trig-
ger the return of sophomore outside hitter Noami Santos-Lamb.  Santos-Lamb was expected to be a key con-tributor to the Gators’ attack in 2012, but she missed the season with a torn ACL suffered during training camp. 
Santos-Lamb has played sparingly 
since returning from injury and did not see any time on the court against Stanford or Penn State.  Santos-Lamb would provide a solid fourth scoring option after Mann, Recek and fresh-man setter Alex Holston.The silver lining for Florida is that 
this matchup was early in the sea-son.  Florida now has a three-match homestand, beginning with the Ac-tive Ankle Challenge on Friday and Saturday in the O’Connell Center.
strong safety Shawn Williams yanked him down by 
the neck and sent him crashing to the ground. 
The hit resulted in a broken left arm for Patton and 
forced him to miss the rest of the year.
Now healthy, the senior receiver is back producing 
for Florida — a critical development for an offensively challenged team. Patton caught one pass for 21 yards and added a carry for 17 yards during Florida’s 24-6 victory against Toledo on Aug. 31.
Saturday against Miami furthered his breakout sea-
son.
Trailing 14-6 after Hurricanes quarterback Stephen 
Morris connected with receiver Phillip Dorsett for a 52-yard touchdown late in the first quarter, Driskel found Patton for a 46-yard gain — UF’s longest pass-ing play of the season.
“It was just a call [Driskel] gave me,” Patton said. “I 
did my best to make the play.”
The big play was one of few bright spots for UF’s 
offense during the game. Although the Gators accu-mulated more than 400 yards of total offense, they continually came up short in the red zone.
Florida came away with just nine points during six 
trips inside Miami’s 20-yard line.
“We’ve just gotta lock in when we get in the red 
zone and just try to make a play,” Patton said. “It’s disappointing, but we’ve still got a long season ahead, and we’re just going to learn from our mistakes.”
Through two games, Patton now has seven grabs 
for 139 yards and a score in addition to three carries for 21 yards.
Combined with junior receiver Quinton Dunbar, 
who caught seven balls for 98 yards against Miami, Patton is the type of explosive aerial threat Florida will need this season.
“He’s a guy we need to get the ball to,” Muschamp 
said of Patton. 
“He caught the ball well. He’s run the reverse. He’s 
done all the things we’ve asked him to do very well.”Patton , from page 13Patton suffered 
broken arm in 2012the Gators’ backs.
Freshman defensive back Vernon Hargreaves III gave 
Florida the momentum it needed with a crucial fourth-
quarter interception, but Driskel gave the ball right back.
The Gators were driving down the field with a chance 
to jump ahead for the first time. Driskel missed his wide receiver and found Hurricanes defensive back Tracy How-ard, who returned the ball 36 yards. Running back Duke Johnson punched the ball into the end zone 3 minutes later and sealed Florida’s fate.
Momentum gone.That is not the defense’s fault.Miami didn’t score from the end of the first quarter until 
the end of the fourth quarter. Florida had a multitude of opportunities that it could not capitalize on.
The defense is the focus of the Gators football team, and 
rightfully so. It is by far the superior unit.
But after Hurricanes quarterback Stephen Morris torched 
them for a 52-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter, the defenders buckled down.
Although the defense did not record an official quar-
terback hurry, Morris was uncomfortable in the pocket for most of the game as Florida’s defensive front moved him from sideline to sideline.
Johnson could not get any momentum up the middle or 
to the outside as the defense stopped him behind the line repeatedly.
With Miami’s two major offensive weapons silenced, 
Florida had a chance to win and win big.
But because of the offense’s repeated failures — and 
the fact that the Hurricanes will not appear on the Gators’ schedule any time soon — Miami fans have perpetual brag-ging rights. MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 9, 2013 § ALLIGATOR, 15

With freshman Savannah Jor-
dan’s quick start to the season, 
Havana Solaun faded into the sup-porting cast of Florida’s offense.
But the junior took the lead role 
on Sunday.
Solaun scored both of No. 10 
Florida’s (5-1) goals in a 2-0 vic-tory against Oklahoma State (3-1-2) on Sunday at James G. Pressly Stadium. 
The 2-0 victory is UF’s third 
straight shutout.
Solaun made her mark early 
in the ﬁ  rst half when fellow mid-ﬁ  elder Annie Speese sent a cross to her 12 yards to the right of the goal at the top of the box in the 11th minute. 
Solaun saw a hole in Oklahoma 
State’s defense and took advan-tage, sending the ball into the right corner of the goal to give Florida an early lead.
After sitting out against Okla-
homa on Friday with a minor in-jury, Solaun returned and found her rhythm.“She’s a good playmaker, and a 
bad matchup for most defenders,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “She’s pretty fast, and she’s tall, and she’s really technical, and she under-stands the game very well.”
Solaun, who was tied as UF’s 
second leading goal scorer in 2012, proved her playmaking abilities again in the second half. 
In the 
52nd minute, Florida main-tained posses-
sion into Oklahoma State’s box. 
Jordan, Speese and Solaun 
packed into the box with Cow-girls’ defenders. Jordan got con-trol, dribbled the ball around the defenders and sent it to Speese. Speese made a short pass to So-laun, who quickly whipped it into the right corner of the goal from 18 yards out.
“The ball was kind of bouncing 
around; I ended up with it some-how,” Speese said. “And there’s Havana again, I always know she’s going to be looking to the ball, so I just laid it off to her right foot and she put it away.”The goal was Solaun’s third 
this season and the third two-goal match of her career. 
“Playing with Annie has al-
ways been so much fun because she just sees the pass and puts it on a silver platter for you,” Solaun said.
The Gators came out with a 
consistently aggressive rhythm — a step up from their slow play on Friday. Florida maintained posses-sion for the majority of the game and put 17 shots on the Oklahoma State goal. The Cowgirls took just three shots on goal. 
“I told our team afterwards, 
when you’re trying to win cham-pionships, that’s what is going to get us there,” Burleigh said. 
Solaun added that the team’s 
motivator for the past few games was the loss they suffered to Flori-da State on Aug. 30.
“After a loss you learn so 
much,” Solaun said. 
“After FSU, we kind of ﬁ  gured 
out what we need to improve on. And we’ve been working re-ally hard to get better at those mis-takes.”
