SG, Alligator to
hold fee forum
0 IT WILL BE HELD IN REITZ
RION BALLROOM AT 4 P.M.
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Staff Writer
Student Government and the
Alligator will host a forum to ad-
dress student questions and con-
cerns about the renovation and
expansion of the Reitz Union to-
day at 4 p.m. in the Reitz Union
Rion Ballroom.
Student Body President Jordan
Johnson will moderate the discus-
sion.
SG Press Secretary Eric Conrad
said the event will give students
the chance to offer advice on how
to fund the repairs.
"Really it's just a chance to
share ideas as well," Conradsaid.
Students will also have the
chance to describe any griev-
ances they have with the Reitz
Union referendum question on
the spring election ballot, Conrad
said.
The question has two parts.
It asks students whether the fee
should be implemented, and if so,
if the fee should cover both ex-
pansion and repairs.
Johnson said he hopes the fo-
rum will serve as an information
session and a way to bring stu-
dents together.
"This is gonna be my way of
providing an outlet for students
to directly reach me, and also it's
going to work two ways," Johnson
said."It's going to be an opportu-
nity for me to really gauge where
students are at on this issue."

Counseling offered for
those affected by
earthquake
The Dean of Students Of-
fice and the Counseling Cen-
ter have joined forces to aid
students affected by Haiti's
earthquake.
"We want to make students
feel safe and comfortable,"said Wayne D. Griffin, associ-
ate director and clinical associ-
ate professor at the Counseling
Center.
Individual counseling and
a support groups for students
have been set up since the
earthquake.
Students can attend the in-
dividual counseling by making
appointments or go to the sup-
port group on Thursdays at 5
p.m. at the Counseling Center
in Peabody Hall.
"The longer people go with-
out hearing from loved ones,
the more serious it becomes,"
Griffin said.
Paige Crandall, interim dean
of students, said her advice to
students is to try to eat well,
get sleep and spend time with
friends and family to get some
closure and support.
She also emphasized not
watching the news constantly
and said the best thing students
can do is get involved in relief
efforts such as Gators United
for Haiti.
Gators United for Haiti orig-
inally began in 2008 for the hur-
ricanes that hit Haiti.
The initiative eventually
died down after some time but
now has been resurrected for
the earthquake.
Gators United for Haiti has
more than 60 on-campus organi-
zations that are working toward
the goal of raising $50,000.
"The students right off the
back wanted to go into action,"
Crandall said.Crandall and
Griffin are aware that students
may experience feelings of guilt
and hopelessness.
"When you're so close to the
incident," Crandall said, "it's
normal to be upset."
Crandall believes that some
students may not feel the ef-
fects now, but in the months to
come they may start to notice a
change in themselves. Crandall
said it is important for friends
to watch out for one another
and be alert to any dramatic
changes in routines or person-
ality.
For information about coun-
seling, students can call 352-
392-1575 or visit counsel.ufl.

Hippodrome seeks cells
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Writer
Kbein@alligator org
The Hippodrome is asking
Gainesville residents to bring out their
dead -cell phones, that is.
As a promotion for performances of
"Dead Man's Cell Phone," the Hippo-
drome State Theatre, 25 SE 2nd Place,
is offering a buy-one-get-one deal on
adult tickets in exchange for used cell
phones, according to a press release.
The phones will be donated to Peace-
ful Paths, a domestic abuse network,
where they will be recycled for money
or given to women in need, according
to the release.
Patrons are asked to delete person-
al contacts and information from the
phones before bringing the phones to
the Hippodrome.
The buy-one-get-one-free offer is
valid until the show's finale Sunday.
Tickets are $12 for students, $20 for
seniors and $25 to $30 for adults.
Jessica Hurov, Hippodrome spokes-woman, said the program is a win-win
situation because it brings people to
the show and allows both the theater
and patrons a chance to donate to the
community.
"Everyone's got one lying around,
and they can be put to good use," she
said.
"Everyone's got one lying

if they're not set up with conventional
services, Hurov said.
Ticket reservations can be made by
phone at 352-375-4477.

By HILARY SHEINBAUM
Alligator Contributing Writer
Economics professors and UF students
discussed the cause of the economic reces-
sion and job prospects for graduates at a
forum Tuesday night in Pugh Hall.
The forum was sponsored by Chomp
the Vote, a Student Government agency
dedicated to raising voter awareness, and
about 80 students attended.
Jenna Stem, Chomp the Vote director,
started the forum by introducing UF eco-
nomics professors David Denslow and
Mark Rush.
Forum moderator and philosophy se-
nior Derek Helmick asked Denslow and
Rush a series of questions stemming from
three topics: the history of the economic cri-
sis, current strategies for economic recov-
ery and America's economic future.
One of the topics related to the cause
and scope of the economic crisis.
Rush and Denslow cited the housing
bubble, mortgages that fueled the bubbleand thousands of loans bundled together.
"I called the recession years before it
happened," Denslow said. "And I kept
calling it."
Chemical engineering senior Daniel
Rood asked Rush's views on centralized
banking.
"AS an economist, it's something I'm
just not sure about on a theoretical level,"
said Rush, who worked for The Federal Re-
serve Bank of Kansas City in the 1980s. "In
the real world, you see every
On nation has a central bank."Campus The professors also spoke
about the realities of gradu-
ating seniors planning to enter the work
force.
"Unfortunately, a relatively high rate
[of] unemployment will be with us for
some time," Denslow said. "If you are
graduating, many of you will continue on
with further education."
Chomp the Vote is holding education
and environment forums at 6 p.m. in Pugh
Hall on February 25 and March 25, respec-
tively.

SG copy center to use recycled paper
It will be an additional $500 a year really make a difference," Cavataro
said.
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Student Government is going
green.
The Student Senate passed a bill
during Tuesday's meeting implement-
ing the use of recycled paper in the SG
copy center.
Student Alliance Party Senate lead-
er Jon Ossip, who represents the Mur-
phree Common Area, said using 30
percent post-consumer paper will cost
SG an additional $500 per year, which
equates to one penny per student per
year.
"This really is the future, where
we take the environment into
account and really make a dif-
ference."
Ben Cavataro
candidate for Student Body president
"Really the best part of this bill is
how inexpensive it is for students,"
Ossip said.
According to the bill, using post-
consumer content to make paper pro-
duces 50 percent less wastewater, uses
44 percent less energy and 41 percent
less greenhouse gases.
The SG copy center on the third
floor of the Reitz Union.
Ben Cavataro, the Student Alliance
Party's candidate for Student Body
president, said the center is used notonly by SG but also by SG-funded
organizations for their publicity cam-
pains and fliers.
Cavataro said the copy center will
start using the recycled paper when
the current stock runs out.
"This really is the future, where we
take the environment into account andUnite Party spokesman Ben Meyers
expressed support for the bill and said
it passed with a nearly unanimous
vote.
Meyers commended the bill and
said it shows good bi-partisan coop-
eration.
"I think it'll do good things," Mey-
ers said.

Library to reopen in Feb.
By EMILY MORROW
Alligator Contributing Writer
After a little more than a year of renova-
tions, the Millhopper Branch Library will
turn over a new page when it reopens Feb.
27.
Volunteers and staff members began un-
packing books, furniture and other materi-
als earlier this week in the newly renovated
building, located at 3145 NW 43rd St.
More than 8,000 square feet were added
to the Millhopper location during its clo-
sure. For the past year, readers have visited
the library's temporary facility on the sec-
ond floor of the Bank of America building,
2627 NW 43rd St.
"The Millhopper Library had really
outgrown the number of people who were
going there," said Angela Harris, spokes-
woman for the Alachua County Library
District. "There wasn't enough space for
patrons to get away, which is one of the
main purposes of a library."
Harris said the renovations include anew adult reading room, a young adult
area, two meeting rooms, a larger circula-
tion area, space for a future caf6, additional
parking and an expanded children's area,
which will include a playground.
Harris said only about 10 percent of the
Millhopper Library's total collection is now
in circulation at its temporary location. The
rest was put in storage and is just now be-
ing pulled out at the renovated site.
Gail Dewsbury, a longtime library lover,
said she is excited for the library to reopen.
"I love to read, the library is my lifeline,"
she said. "I can't wait for the reopening."
Dewsbury thinks the Millhopper
branch's expansions to the circulation area
and the parking lot will be more conve-
nient.
The temporary site will close Feb. 15 to
allow staff members to finish transferring
the collection.
From Feb. 15 to Feb. 26, there will be no
Millhopper branch open.
Until Feb. 15, Harris said, books should
be returned to the temporary location.J. Hunter Sizemore/ Alligator Staff

Journalism forum offers advice, comfort for students
About 50 students attended the panel discussion in Ustler Hall
By MELISSA ANGEL
Alligator Contributing Writer
Alumni, students and faculty
discussed the dynamic role of
technology and the future of jour-
nalism in times of economic peril
during a forum Tuesday evening
with an audience of about 50 in
Ustler Hall.
UF College of Journalism
and Communications Dean John
Wright admitted he needed assis-
tance with his adaption to moderntechnology.
"We have a lot of new media,"
Wright said, "but I often need
help."
Wright stressed the idea that
students need to help faculty rise
up to the journalism challenge.
Mindy McAdams, a panelist
and an online journalism professor
at UF, informed students in atten-
dance they were going to have to
make their own paths.
"Journalism is no longer just a
job," McAdams said. "You have toget yourself noticed by publishing
and broadcasting yourself."
April Dudash, UF's Society of
Professional Journalists president
and panel member, spoke about
the fears she faces upon graduat-
On ing I1 remember
Campus walking into Weimer
[Hall] and having a
very naive take on things, that af-
ter school, I'd instantly get a job at
a big Tampa paper," Dudash said.
"That's definitely not the case any-more. Things are so tumultuous
right now. You have to work twice
as hard to get where you want to
be."
Mike Foley, a panelist and mas-
ter lecturer in the department of
journalism, gave hope to the grad-
uating seniors at the forum.
"This might be the most exciting
time for journalism," Foley said.
McAdams said students need
to learn how to write the same 500-
word story in 140 words.
Foley emphasized the impor-stance of the quality of stories and
said students should treat every
article as if it's their best.
"The value is on storytelling,
Foley said. "I urge you to tell sto-
ries."
After hearing the advice of jour-
nalism professors, students dis-
cussed their career plans.
Britt Perkins, a junior journal-
ism major, talked about her goal-
safter graduation.
"I just want to get an intern-
ship," Perkins said. "I'm prepared
to do everything: photography,
video, audio clips. I'm prepared to
work."

Reitz Now
Students should attend
town hall forum, vote
emember when Student Government first announced
it wanted to charge students a fee to expand and im-
prove the Reitz Union?
Well, the Editorial Board certainly remembers. Our in-
boxes were flooded with e-mails from students supporting
it, hating it and having every possible opinion in between.
Well, today you get the chance to ask about everything
you ever wanted to know involving the fee, the Retiz Union
and the effect it will have on you.
That's right folks, SG and the Independent Florida Al-
ligator are co-sponsoring a town hall forum just for you at 4
p.m. in the Retiz Union Grand Ballroom.
So show up, learn a little more about what's going on and
ask Student Body President Jordan Johnson any questions
you may have that could solidify or change your stance on
the issue.
But your part doesn't end there.
Last week, the Student Senate passed a bill that will put
a referendum question on the spring election ballot asking
if students support the fee.
During the fall election, only 8,483 students voted -out
of 49,679.
That's a whopping 17 percent, people.
We understand most of you could care less about SG
elections and the only reason you even realize they're go-
ing on is because you're bombarded by fliers on Turlington
Plaza.
But this fee will affect undergraduate students and grad-
uate students alike, so there is no excuse for not voting and
ensuring your opinion is heard on Feb. 23 and Feb. 24.
Petty PETA
here's no shortage ofvegetarians at the Al-
ligator. Several of our
staff members forgo turkey
in favor of Tofurkey, and
one of us hasn't had dairy
in years. But a recent blog
from PETA has the Editorial
Board raising its eyebrows.
In an online post Sunday
afternoon, a blogger from
the organization tied terror-
ism to meat eating.
He wrote, "As if the world
needed another example
of the proven link between
violence against animals and
violence against humans,
Ghulam Rasool Khan -a
suspected al-Qaida mem-
ber jailed in India -refuses
to eat the vegetarian food
served to him, instead de-
manding [meat]."
Now don't get us wrong.
We agree with a lot of what
PETA stands for -the erad-ication of animal abuse, the
end of fur clothing -but
some of its practices, includ-
ing the blog post, are doing
more harm than good.
But if you try to convince
us that our meat-eating
friends are more likely to
have murderous tendancies
than our vegan ones, we're
just going to roll our eyes.
By making hasty specula-
tions, PETA alienates people
who may have considered
vegetarianism or veganism
but shy away from being as-
sociated with the group's in-
your-face approach.
While we respect PETA's
ideals and ultimately wish
it well in making the world
an animal-friendly place,
we think it should take a
moment to step back and
consider the ramifications
of making cavalier assump-
tions.

Religion must evo
he whirlwind that is "Avatar" made it over to the Vati-
can earlier this month in a private screening before its
release in Italy. They were not enthused with the mov-
ie, and I am not surprised with their reaction.
Their criticism ran along the lines of picking out pagan
themes in the movie, specifically citing "a spiritualism linked
to the worship of nature."
They further chided the movie by saying it overstepped
its bounds by implying nature is "no longer a creation to de-
fend, but a divinity to worship." They also dubbed ecology
as the "religion of the new millennium."
Well, thank God I came across their review in time, be-
cause I was just about to go out and sacrifice three goats in
my vine-laden arbor shrine to honor Gaia (being motivated
by those giant blue aliens, of course). But I had almost forgot-
ten how silly it would have been to worship something as
green and impersonal as nature, as opposed to the warmth
and comfort of an incomprehensible, personified totality of
existence. Close one -I mean, after all, what's the fun in
having faith in something that's tangible and clearly exists?
Of course, this whole situation is entirely ironic coming
from the Vatican, as their chief astronomer, Jose Funes, in
2008 suggested life on other planets is indeed possible, and
that, in the event of meeting some aliens, the proper way to
treat them would be to regard them as our brothers and sis-
ters. (I wonder if "Jose Funes" is Italian for "Joe Biden"?)
I can imagine the multitude of eyes rolling in the Vatican
after hearing word of this, but perhaps not out of contempt.
Sure, we can go along with that notion, they'd say, but how
do we get them to believe this stuff? And I'm sure you can
imagine the awkwardness when the aliens try to break the
ice by offering the church the wondrous teachings of their
savior, Gldflbjk-X1.
It sounds like the church is going above and beyond the
call of duty with this reaction -sour grapes, perhaps? Or
maybe it's their Glenn Beck level of rationalization of this
purported new ecological religion they seem so worriedALLIGATOR

lve with audience
Ryan Spencer
letters@alligator orgabout. How many people do they
think could be potentially converted
by the movie? And how many people
do they think would clamor as to why
they didn't seize the responsibility to
denounce the film if they'd chosen to
keep mum?
It seems this is another familiar
example of religion trying to adapt
to modernity. The alien gaffe and the
ecological religion claim suggest the church is trying to cope
with an ever-evolving audience.
They're not alone in this endeavor. The new, hip Christian
youth movements, popularized and satirized in the movie
"Saved!", are further examples, with the most recent case in
point being the "Christian Side Hug" video. (If you haven't
seen it, treat yourself.) And it's not just Christians who are
trailblazing the new millennium's open-ended paths to righ-
teousness. Muslims are getting treated to the Islamic comic
book series "The 99," related to the ninety-nine names of Al-
lah, and to 4shbab, the self-described "MTV Islam."
I could go off here about indoctrination this-and-that, but
I won't -I don't have enough room. However, I will draw
attention to two prevailing themes that will be exceedingly
crucial to religion in this century: audience and message.
It seems there is an increasingly inverse relationship be-
tween the two in which controlling the message sacrifices its
potential audience, and, likewise, garnering a substantial au-
dience sacrifices the message. This is the best I can conclude
from the marketing ploys described above.
Am I suggesting religion is on the out? Of course not. (I
don't have that much faith in people's decisions.) What I am
suggesting is that the longer an increasingly well-connected
and well-communicated populous goes without the defini-
tive recognition of the fantastic and the implausible, the fur-
ther into the attics of their minds do such myths retreat.

Letters to the Editor
Unite Party already has executive ticket
chosen
Alligator, I've got a wager for you. I find it
hilarious the Unite Party says it will be "con-
ducting interviews" to determine its execu-
tive candidates. It's common knowledge they
have already chosen Marcus Dixon to run for
vice president and Virlany Taboada to run for
treasurer. Because I feel bad for the students
who will come out to interview when Unite
has made up its mind, I'm willing to put my
reputation on the line. If I'm wrong then feel
free to Dart me, Joshua Niederriter, when
they announce their candidates. But if I'm
right send a Dart at the party for misleading
the Student Body. I hope you take me up on
this offer because either way you win.

Sarcasm lost on readers
This is regarding Kyle Maistri's article
in Tuesday's paper about playing pick-
up basketball at Southwest Rec. No one
should go play pick-up if they are looking
to impress the guys around them. Every-
one goes to play for the exercise and for
the love of the game. This article epitomiz-
es the type of player everyone at South-
west Rec hates to play with. Don't ever
switch on defense, harass anyone who
calls a foul on you and then call every-
thing. You play to win, not to look good.

4EG and 5EGGuest column
Students invited to forum
we begin discussions on howto effectively address the issues
that face the Reitz Union, Stu-
dent Government and the Alligator have
teamed up to host a town hall forum.
The purpose of this town hall forum will
be to provide students an opportunity to
learn about the significant issues facing
our Union and engage each other in a
constructive conversation.
Throughout this process my admin-
istration has sought the opinions and
concerns of the entire student body. But
in order to best gauge student opinion
on this issue, I have supported a ballot
initiative to appear on the Spring 2010
election ballot asking whether students
support renovating the Reitz Union
and more specifically, funding a project
through a student fee. We want to make
sure any questions that students may
have about this important issue are an-
swered so voters can move forward to
the Spring elections with all information
available to them.
The forum will be held today at 4
p.m. in the Reitz Union Rion Ballroom.
At the forum we will be discussing
the "State of the Union" and how it will
affect the student experience on campus
today and for years to come.
As you probably know by now, when
the Reitz Union was opened in 1967, it
served the 19,000 students of the univer-
sity as a place to gather, eat and study.
At the time, it was a state of the art fa-
cility which nearly $6 million to build.
The creation of the Union was funded
through a student fee. Since then therehave been many
renovations but
the Union still
retains most of
its original in-
frastructure like
Jordan Johnson the air condition-
Speaking Out ing system and
power convert-
ers. A recent sur-
vey detailed the need for $42.5 million
in repairs to the building over the next
15 years just to remain operational and
as-is. Coupled with the lack of space
for student organizations, study areas,
dance groups and retail options the Re-
itz Union has fallen behind the student
unions of universities like USF, UNF
and FSU.
These universities have already suc-
cessfully rebuilt their student unions
using a student fee like the one we are
discussing today.
I believe that history doesn't choose
the right time for us to leave our legacy.
We do. And a new student union, a new
Heart of the Gator Nation, can be a hall-
mark of our university's unending com-
mitment to coming together for a greater
cause. I invite all of you to continue the
conversation with your friends and
classmates as we navigate our options to
improve our university with a student
union that we can all be proud of. I hope
you will participate in today's dialogue
as we try to make the best decisions to
preserve the integrity of our student ex-
perience at Florida's flagship university.

Experts consider hypothetical Gainesville earthquake
Most campus buildings would be damaged
By KATHLEEN BIRKHIMER
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Swamp Restaurant would
be shaken and stirred six feet to
the west. Century Tower would
crumble to a pile of bricks like a
stack of Legos.
Campus parking lots would
amount to nothing more than
heaps of smoking concrete.
This is the gruesome aftermath
Ray Russo, an assistant profes-
sor in UF's geology department,
imagined if a 7.0-magnitude
earthquake like the one that shook
Haiti two weeks ago ravaged
Gainesville.
However, there is noGainesville equivalent to the En-
riquillo-Plantain Garden Fault,
which is responsible for Haiti's
devastating quake that reportedly
caused at least 150,000 deaths.
"Imagine sitting in the Swamp
restaurant and, suddenly, it shifts
six feet to the west," Russo said.
"This shift would be accompa-
nied by severe shaking and roll-
ing of the ground surface, causing
everything on your table to fly
off,you to be bounced out of your
chair, all those big glass windows
to shatter, spraying glass shards
everywhere; and, if you were
unlucky, perhaps the building
would fail such that the top floor
telescoped down onto the indoordining area."
A similar ruthless pattern
would strike University Avenue
for about 11 miles in both direc-
tions, Russo estimated.
He added that most campus
buildings would be severely dam-
aged or destroyed, though he
doubts casualties would reach a
few thousand.
"My guess is the Ben Hill Grif-
fin stadium would experience
extensive damage, the Century
Tower would come down. [and]
the various multistory parking
lots would probably be death
traps," Russo said.
The UF emergency-response
system has no specific guidelinesto deal with an earthquake, said
Bill Properzio, UF director of en-
vironmental health and safety.
"Imagine sitting in the
Swamp restaurant and,
suddenly, it shifts six feet
to the west."
Ray Russo
assistant professor of geology
The general resources available
in an emergency include adminis-
trative bodies such as the opera-
tional management team, a phone
system, and the text messaging
system, which can alert 64,000 cell
phones, according to Properzio.
Ironically, some of the build-
ings designated as emergency-re-sponse shelters during hurricanes
might be among the most danger-
ous during an earthquake.
The Reitz Union is among those
potential shelters, but Russo sus-
pected the Reitz Union Colonnade
would be reduced to rubble.
However, the O'Connell Cen-
ter, which does not qualify as
a safe zone during high winds,
could be among the safest places
during an earthquake because of
the dome's minimal roof weight,
according to Russo.
"If we were [hit] like Haiti, we
would be getting people out of
here," Properzio said. "Luckily,
we're not an island that is very dif-
ficult to get emergency response
to. we're in a much better situ-
ation here than the unfortunate
people in Haiti."
New UF building opens doors
By ANNA DAGGS
Alligator Contributing Writer
A new building is bringing
more than 150 UF professors
from eight different colleges
under one roof.
The Emerging Pathogens
Institute focuses on controlling
new and re-emerging diseases.
About 200 people attended
a dedication ceremony for the
institute Tuesday afternoon.
The building features an
80,000-square-foot facility built
using a $55 million fund from
the Florida Legislature. Medi-cal, engineering and liberal arts
and sciences researchers will be
among those who work there.
The dedication included
speeches from President Ma-
chen, Florida Surgeon General
Dr. Ana M. Viamonte Ros and
Jerold Mande,
On U.S. Department
Campus of Agriculture
Deputy Under-
secretary for Food Safety.
Glenn Morris, the director of
the Emerging Pathogens Insti-
tute, said the institute will help
develop a creative approach to
stopping diseases from enter-
ing the U.S."One of the things that is
really exciting about this build-
ing is that we can bring togeth-
er investigators from different
disciplines," Morris said.
The event also featured
posters describing the research
completed by 84 UF students
and faculty.
Daniel Swale, a Ph.D stu-
dent in entomology, displayed
his research findings on a post-
er.
He said he is new to
Gainesville and looking for-
ward to conducting research
alongside specialists from dif-
ferent areas of campus.
Filmmaker discusses violence
0 ABOUT 350 STUDENTS ATTENDED
THE SPEECH.
By MINCH MINCHIN
Alligator Contributing Writer
She's drunk. He's trying to have sex with
her. It's just another college party.
Jackson Katz, an educator, author, film-
maker and lecturer on sexist and domestic
violence issues, spoke to about 350 students,
mostly student athletes, at the Touchdown
Terrace in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium Tuesday
evening.
Katz said friends should start acting like
friends and intervene before something goes
wrong.
Speaking to the male athletes in the room,
Katz said team image problems can be avoid-
ed if teammates stop one another from com-
mitting sexually violent acts.
"When people hear that a football player
beat up his girlfriend, they say, 'What a bunchof thugs that football team is,"' he said. "It's
not just the one person who is hurt."
Throughout his speech and a series of video
clips, Katz encouraged the athletes to set good
examples for kids because children look up to
athletes more than almost any other group.
His presentation focused
on the idea that everyone,
both men and women,
should be actively engaged
in stopping violence against
women.
"Historically, sexual as-
sault and violence were seen
Katz as women's issues that some
good men helped out with,"
he said. "I see them as men's issues. We as men
are in a position to do something about it."
Katz's speech also featured a discussion
about sexism in hip-hop culture.
Calvin Smith, a sociology senior, said Katz's
speech was enlightening.
"I'd never thought of rap and hip-hop mu-
sic videos being a problem before," he said.
Theft may be due to a demand for tailgates on the black market
CRIME, from page 1
immune, but they're not," she
said.
In order to deter potential
thieves, Mazzuca says not to
keep valuable items, such as GPS
devices, cell phones, iPods, wal-lets and purses, within sight.
In addition, residents should
not leave loose change within
view because it serves as a main
attraction to potential burglars.
According to ASO spokesman
Art Forgey, tailgate theft is a new
problem.
Since Jan. 19, three tailgateshave been stolen.
According to Forgey, the tail-
gate thefts might just
Local be a matter of coin-
News cidence as all three
thefts occurred at
different locations.
However, the fact that such
activity has never been reportedprior to the recent thefts, along for tailgates on the black market.
with the fact that all the tailgates
taken were taken from vehicles
made by General Motors, has
raised suspicion.
Fogery offered two poten-
tial motives behind the tailgate
swipes.
One possibility is the demandAnother is an attempt to replace
their own tailgates to circumvent
the costs of getting it replaced.
If you have any information
regarding any burglaries or tail-
gate thefts, please call the sher-
iff's office at 352-955-1818.Dance Fever

Florida focused on avoiding letdown
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@aligator org
All season, Billy Donovan has preached the
virtues of keeping things in perspective.
After starting off the Southeastern Conference
season on a two-game losing streak, Donovan
is looking to keep his team grounded during its
three-game winning streak, capped off by Chan-
dler Parsons' buzzer-beater Saturday.
The last few years, the Gators have struggled
after finding success. Even this season, they
dropped three consecutive games -two of which
came to unranked Richmond and South Alabama
-after climbing into the top 10 after an 8-0 start.
Florida (14-5,3-2 SEC) will look to avoid a sim-
ilar letdown against Georgia (9-8, 1-3 SEC) tonight
at 7 in the O'Connell Center.
Men's
Basketball"The one thing I love about
competition is that there are
absolutely no prejudices in-
volved," Donovan said. "The
minute the ball goes up, we
don't start the game against
Georgia with a couple extra
points because Chandler made
that three. We don't start the game against LSU
(on Jan. 16) down by five because we lost two
games before that."
Although Georgia has struggled throughout
the year, dropping games to the likes of Wof-
ford early in the season, the Bulldogs caught the
Gators' attention last weekend by upsetting No.
14 Tennessee 78-63 on Saturday.
"It's huge, especially when you see what they
just did to Tennessee," Parsons said. "They're ca-
pable of beating anybody. In this league, anything
can happen any night. Definitely here, Wednes-
day night, at our place, we've got to protect our
home court."
From the way the Gators spoke about Wednes-
day's game, they are following Donovan's advice
about keeping things in perspective.
But they've been down this road before. While
Donovan cautioned his team earlier this season
about staying humble and his players said all the

As National Signing Day creeps closer,
Florida is expected to pick up a few more
commitments to round-out its 2010 recruit-
ing class.
But it got one few could have seen com-
ing when Wethersfield (Conn.) High's two-
star quarterback Tyler Murphy verbally
committed Sunday to play for Florida.
According to Rivals.com, Murphy is
the lowest rated prospect in the Gators'
2010 recruiting class. Before switching his"These coaches aren't

Newberg said the Gators 26th commit isfor the Gators.
"It's not determined yet what he'll
play," Newberg said. "I'd imagine he'd get
his first shot at quarterback, especially be-
cause there is no one really proven behind
(John) Brantley. Also he's athletic, big and
fast enough to play another position such
as halfback or wide receiver."
Murphy is the third Gators recruit to
come from Connecticut in the last four
years, joining tight end Aaron Hernandez

NFL career: He's not going to suc-
ceed at quarterback.
OK, so no one has said it yet, but there
has not been much good news about his
performance there except that he is a
great leader.
Although I don't think he will be a
great quarterback, or even a good one for
that matter, he does deserve the chance
to prove everyone -including me -
wrong.
People are already criticizing his abil-
ity to take snaps
under center, but
they should re-
member that he
has not been asked
to do that very
much since before

bcallovi@aligator org of working out of
the shotgun, and I
doubt he learned too much footwork be-
fore that time.
He needs time to learn, and you know
he will give it his all.
But it's not just his footwork that's the
problem.
He has a well-documented slow re-
lease, runs too often for almost any NFL
owner who is putting millions of his dol-
lars into a quarterback and isn't the best
at reading defenses.
All of those issues are making NFL
scouts weary of his prospects at quarter-
back.
But no matter how many problems he
may have, Tebow is still worth drafting.
I would never use a first-round pick
on him, but if he's there in the late-sec-
ond or third rounds, I'd scoop him up.
He will be a money machine for any
franchise.
Some fans want to see him succeed,
some want to see him fail and others just
want to see what he will be like at the pro
level, but everyone wants to watch him.
No. 15 Gators jerseys are all over the
place, so you know a jersey with Tebow
on the back will sell.
UF coach Urban Meyer had said in the
past that he thinks Tebow can be success-
ful at the next level in the right system.

right things, it didn't show on the
court.
So, what makes this time around
any different? It depends on who's
answering that question, but Par-
sons and guards Kenny Boynton
and Erving Walker all mentioned
one word: focus.
BOBBY, from page 14
To me, that means not a typical
NFL-style offense. Even then, I'm
not sure he can be good, but his best
shot is in a wildcat-like scheme.
The big thing is no one is going
to want to see him stand on the side-
lines, so the team that drafts him is
going to need to find a way to get
him on the field. The problem is he
most likely won't be anywhere near
ready to play quarterback in the NFL
early on and he doesn't seem will-
ing to play any other position until
he has a chance to prove he can or
can't play quarterback, which means
the team may have to add a Tebow-Boynton noted the team's focus
in the late-game situations it faced
at Arkansas and against South Caro-
lina last week. That made the Gators
more prepared to handle their re-
cent success.
Walker pointed to UF's focus on
the rest of the season, instead of its
past accomplishments, as reason to
believe the team can build on what
it has done the last few weeks.
specific scheme to its playbook.
I know Tebow wants to prove
people wrong about his ability to
play quarterback in the NFL, but
with all the flaws in his game, he
should start practicing other posi-
tions.
That doesn't mean giving up
his dream, but it means preparing
himself for a possible change so he
doesn't put his NFL career behind a
couple years to learn a new position.
Until he fails at quarterback and
switches to tight end, he is going to
continue to hear about his poor foot-
work and slow release, but Tebow
has earned the chance to prove his
ability to NFL coaches before mak-
ing a change."We just beat three good teams,
but there's a long
way to go -11
more conference
games and Xavi-Men's er," Walker said.
Basketball "We're just get-ting into the thick
of it."
Parsons said the team's focus in
practice has been better than it wasin the past. Donovan's decision to
implement a break in practices has
paid dividends for Florida coming
out after halftime lately.
The Gators' rebounding has
also improved. Parsons and junior
power forward Alex Tyus have
combined for 55 total rebounds over
the last three games, a span where
the Gators have outrebounded their
opponents en route to three-straight
RECRUIT, from page 14
and quarterback Jordan Reed.
If Murphy stays at quarterback, he will have
adjustments and improvements to make before
finding success in the SEC, Newberg said.
"He's head and shoulders above the compe-
tition (in Connecticut), and playing in a spread
offense," Newberg said. "He's got a good arm,
but it's very raw so he needs to work on me-
chanics. Florida's going to have their work cutSEC wins.
"After the 0-2 start, coach wrote
on the board that we weren't doing
the physical plays like getting loose
balls, stepping up and taking charg-
es, getting rebounds," Parsons said.
"Me and Alex are just two guys who
have been through it before, have
been outrebounded our whole ca-
reer. We just wanted to step it up in
that category to help our team."
out for them if that's the decision they go with,
but the kid is a very good athlete."
If he stays at his high school position, he will
be working closely with quarterbacks coach Scot
Loeffler, who was brought in from the Detroit
Lions in 2009. Loeffler was also the point-man
in Murphy's recruitment.
Murphy's commitment leaves only three
scholarships remaining for UF's 2010 class.
Verbal commitments are non-binding until a
letter of intent is signed on or after Feb. 3.

Freshmen excel right away
By ANDREW OLSON He was impressed that Will, ranked No. 13
Alligator Writer in singles play, "consistently put the ball away"
When Florida takes on UCF today at 5 p.m.,
two freshmen will be leading the charge for
the Gators.
Lauren Embree and Allie Will are both al-
ready ranked in the top 15 in singles play only
one match into the Gators' dual-match sched-
ule and showed UF coach Roland Thornqvist
that they are further along than most fresh-
men.
Thornqvist said the two are better prepared
than "traditional freshmen" this early in the
season.
Despite playing in just their first year at the
college level, they have experience that pre-
pared them for competing at UF (1-0), espe-
cially Embree.
Thornqvist specifically cited No. 15 Em-
bree's experience of playing in the main draw
of the 2009 French Open as more advanced
than a normal freshman.
Embree easily won her first match in the
dual-match schedule 6-2, 6-2 against Irina Par-
aschiv of North Texas on Sunday.
"She's played the main draw of the French
Open. Playing against North Texas for the
Gators probably isn't a big deal," Thornqvist
said.
Thornqvist also spoke highly of his other
top-15 freshman, Allie Will, who won her
match 6-2, 6-1 against Madura Ranganathan of
North Texas.against North Texas despite windy conditions
that made the match a harder challenege for
the Gators than the 7-0 victory shows.
"When she has power on both sides com-
bined with the athleticism, she's going to be
very, very tough to beat," Thornqvist said of
Will.
Will also participates in doubles com-
peition.
She and senior Marrit Boonstra make up the
No. 26 doubles team in the
nation. The duo beat its North
Texas compeition 8-3.
Thornqvist believes that
Boonstra is another poten-
tial top-10 talent and under
ranked at No. 81 in singles
play.
At Monday's press confer-
ence, he said figuring out which starting posi-
tions to place all the talent on the team "is a
pleasant problem to have."
One area Thornqvist will be looking for the
two freshmen and the rest of his team to im-
prove on is controlling the pace and flow of
the match.
Thornqvist said his team had to come from
behind in many of its wins Sunday against
North Texas.
Florida is 7-0 all-time against UCF, and the
Gators' men's team topped the Knights 7-0 on
Friday.
Gators using bye week to rest, prepare for Rebels
UF won four straight after last break
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@alligator org
The Gators are on their bye week, but that
hardly means rest and relaxation.
This will be Florida's only week off during
Southeastern Conference play, and it won't
have a game until Sunday on the road at Ole
Miss.
While the weeklong hiatus allows UF (11-
9, 4-3 SEC) to hone in on its next opponent,
the bye week doesn't really deviate from the
norm.A sign that conference play is intensifying
as March sits on the horizon.
"I think this is the week where you can sep-
arate yourselves as one of the top four teams
in the SEC in terms of getting in extra work,"
senior guard Steffi Sorensen said. "We'll do
whatever it takes as far as this week, even
though we don't have a game, we'll still be
focused and trying to get better."
While players get a chance to rest their
legs and regroup without having to worry
about a mid-week game, their brains may get
the heavier workout processing information
about the Rebels."The main focus is Ole Miss," sophomore
forward Ndidi Madu said, "but we're going
to use some time for us and then make Ole
Miss our primary focus."
That means the Gators
will look internally to clean
up their game -limiting
turnovers, practicing jumpWomen's shots and free throws -
Basketball before turning their atten-
tion to breaking down the
Rebels.
The last weeklong break UF had was dur-
ing Christmas, after which the Gators won
four-straight games, including their first two
SEC games.UF has cooled down since then (2-3), and
it will look to rediscover that focus during its
bye week
Game planning for Ole Miss will be made
easier because there's no game this week.
No quick turnaround between opponents
gives the Gators ample time to digest all the
information they can gather on their confer-
ence foe.
Players said a week off is nice to heal up,
but players love to play, not practice, and
a weeklong absence will make the Gators
hearts that much fonder of Oxford, Miss.
"Everyone's going to be so amped to play
after a week of practice," Sorensen said. "Ev-
eryone wants to play a game."Steven H. Keys / Alligator Staff
