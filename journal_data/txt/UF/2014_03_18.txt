A small electrical ﬁ  re Monday after-
noon resulted in sporadic power outages 
across campus.
At about 4:30 p.m., the Nanoscale Re-
search Facility, across the street from the 
New Engineering Building, experienced a power surge, said UF spokeswoman Jan-
ine Sikes.  
The facility partially lost power, as did 
parts of campus including Library West and Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium.
All power, with the exception of the fa-
cility, was back on by about 5:30 p.m.
“The power surge ultimately tripped 
the circuits at some of these buildings across campus,” Sikes said. “No one was hurt.”
Students in places like Library West 
didn’t know why they were without pow-er until they received UF Alerts.
When Mark Hegedus, a 19-year-old UF 
accounting freshman, got to the library, a guard told him he couldn’t go upstairs be-cause of the power loss. 
“They didn’t tell me what was happen-
ing, so I had to make an excuse to get up there,” he said. “It was really scary.”
Inside the library, emergency lights 
came on while power was being restored. 
Katherine Brisco, a 33-year-old UF 
health science senior, said she was sad she couldn’t use her Starbucks app to buy cof-fee during the outage. But she said she en-
joyed the change in lighting.
“It was kind of calming,” she said. Campus ﬁ  re sparks power outages in dorms, Lib West

The UF College of Edu-
cation is now No. 21 among 
public education colleges after rocketing up nine spots in U.S News and World Report’s new-
est ranking.
The college was previously 
ranked No. 30 among all grad-
uate schools — both public and private — in the education cat-egory.
It remains the highest-
ranked education school in Florida and in the Southeastern 
Conference.
Several of UF’s College of 
Education specializations re-
main highly ranked as well.Special education and 
counselor education programs jumped to No. 5 nationwide, while elementary education — No. 16 — and curriculum and instruction — No. 18 — both remained ranked in the top 20.
UF met qualiﬁ  cations in 
overall research funding, av-erage funding per faculty member, faculty-student ratio, student selectivity and peer as-sessments, among others, to at-tain its rating, said Tom Dana, UF College of Education assis-tant dean of academic affairs.
Dana said he believes the 
latest ranking is a reﬂ  ection of a ﬁ  ve-year effort to move for-ward in research funding.
The UF College of Educa-
tion has put a stronger em-phasis on obtaining external UF education college

A UF student wants to give the Reitz Union fountain a 
makeover — complete with rotating fountainheads that move 
to music and shoot colored water up to 60 feet in the air.
Clint Ferguson, a 20-year-old UF business management 
sophomore, has joined ranks with student engineers to design 
and build what he calls the ﬁ  rst hydrotechnic fountain system 
on a university campus.
Hydrotechnic fountains control elements such as water, 
lighting and sound to create synchronized shows. Ferguson said if the proposal is accepted, the Reitz fountain would have features like LED lights and waterproof sound systems for stu-dent-produced shows.
“By day, the pond would have a peaceful, pulsing fountain 
to give you something to drown out the cars and buses,” he said. “By night, there would be 30-minute, fully choreographed water shows with lasers and lights, all set to music.”Ferguson said the project was inspired by World of Color, a 
show at Disney California Adventure Park. 
He contacted the show’s production company in Fall 2012 
about the cost of bringing a similar system to UF.
The companies told him it would cost $1 million. When he 
proposed the idea to the Reitz Union Board, members were 
supportive, but they told him to cut costs. 
Ferguson decided to turn to student organizations to pro-
duce plans for the project’s ﬁ  ve systems: lighting, hydraulics, 
electronics, software and sound.

junior, signed on as the mechanical lead after Ferguson pre-Student proposes musical, LED fountain for remodeled ReitzSEE EDUCATION, PAGE 4

Miniature horse Sweetheart visits the Zoo Atlanta as a member of Gentle Carousel Miniature Therapy 
Horses. The horses visited to provide information on how zoo animals react to service animals. BEATRICE DUPUY
Alligator Staff Writer bdupuy@alligator.org
Fluttering her long eyelashes, 
she held her composure while the 
Sumatran tiger held its stare.
Not even a tiger could make 
1-year-old miniature horse Sweet-
heart act anything contrary to her 
name.
Maybe it was the protective 
glass, but the white, toy-like horse did not appear fazed by the more than 200-pound cat eyeing her.
Sweetheart and her sister Mag-
ic have returned to Gainesville af-ter about two weeks of traveling 
with Gentle Carousel Miniature 
Therapy Horses, a local nonproﬁ  t. The team of horses brings its tiny hooves into hospitals and hospic-es each year to comfort children and adults.
While on their ﬁ  rst multi-state 
children’s hospital tour of the year, the two horses were invit-
ed to visit Zoo Atlanta to act as 
stand-ins for service animals.  
The horses visited the zoo to 
provide consultation on how zoo animals would react to service animals and how service animals would maneuver around the zoo.  
During their zoo visit, the 
horses saw twin baby pandas and 
komodo dragons and rode on 
the carousel, said Debbie Garcia-Bengochea, co-founder of Gentle Carousel.
“They were the same size as 
the little carousel horses,” she said. “Our horses do much more than horses around the world would do.” 
The horses walked around the 
zoo with the zoo veterinarian and videographer. 
Garcia-Bengochea said it was 
the ﬁ  rst time horses had been al-lowed to walk in the zoo.
The nonproﬁ  t’s miniature 
horses are famous around the world for their help in times of tragedy. 
Garcia-Bengochea said often, 
sick children have never seen a horse before. 
“A lot of the cases, it will be 
the only horses they ever touch,” she said. 
In 2013, the therapy horses 
were brought to Moore, Okla., to comfort victims of the May tor-nado.
After the Sandy Hook Elemen-
tary School shooting, the horses were invited to come and help ease the pain for residents of Newtown, Conn. With the bless-
ing of a 6-year-old victim’s par-
ents, a Gentle Carousel miniature horse was given her name: Cath-erine Hubbard.
Gentle Carousel’s outreach 
doesn’t end in the U.S. The non-proﬁ  t has taken the therapeutic horses overseas. The organization opened up a branch in Greece to 
help children in hospital care and 
orphanages.
Garcia-Bengochea said the 
horses’ training at UF Health Shands Rehab Hospital has great-ly helped in preparing them for their travels. At the hospital, the horses have been used for every-thing from helping patients retake their ﬁ  rst steps to encouraging burn victims to stretch by reach-
ing to touch the animals.
“We’ve seen a lot of little mira-
cles there,” she said.
The organization has 27 min-
iature horses in training for its 
therapy program. Andrea Gilbert, staff occupa-
tional therapist at the UF Health Shands Rehab Hospital, uses the horses to work with some of her older patients. Gilbert said hav-ing the horses at the hospital in-stantly brightens up the patients and “helps them forget their pain for once.”
“Gruff, grumpy old men can’t 
help but break out into a smile and reach out to touch the little creatures,” she said.
To get an early start on train-
ing, the baby horses are brought into the hospital with their moth-
ers. When Sweetheart was about 
8 weeks old, she was brought to the hospital.
“She would lay her head in 
people’s laps,”  Garcia-Bengochea said. “She had hearts shaped on her hips when she was born.” 
While the other horses get 
back to helping people in thera-
py, Sweetheart and Magic will be 
taking a short vacation after their tour.
“They’re like little rock stars,” 
Garcia-Bengochea said.

Families looking for a more communi-
ty-based and eco-friendly style of living 
might be interested in purchasing a home 
at the first official cohousing community in the state of Florida.
Gainesville Cohousing is planning to 
build a community of 24 houses, which will provide families with an opportunity 
to live in a close-knit society with shared 
resources, said Judy Broward, a future res-ident and current community planner.
With cohousing, individual houses re-
side in a general area and share common facilities. It’s a cooperative community 
where members are expected to partici-
pate in the maintenance of the property, and in return, will be given the opportu-nity to contribute to society decisions, Bro-ward said.
The 4.75 acres of land located at 4500 
NW 27th Ave., where the community will 
be built, was purchased last month after a 
two-year search, Broward said. 
She said the houses will be small, rang-
ing between 800 and 1,600 square feet. The prices will vary between $125,000 for the smaller units and a little more than 
$200,000 for the larger ones. There are 12 committed families, and 
Gainesville Cohousing is seeking 12 more. 
It hopes to get more young people and cre-ate an intergenerational community with 
people of all ages, Broward said.
The building process is expected to 
begin in a year and will take about five months to complete, said Burt Kempner, 
a future resident and community plan-ner. He said what makes this cohousing 
community different is that it “isn’t in the 
boondocks.” Rather, it’s within walking distance of the Thornebrook Village Shop-
ping Center.
“My wife and I have been looking for a 
cohousing community for years. One day on a whim, we decided to Google it, and 
this popped up,” Kempner said. 
Architect Andrew Kaplan said the goal 
is for dwellers to function in the city while remaining tied to their sustainable living philosophy.
Kaplan will be living in the community 
with his wife, Cheryl Kaplan. He said the units will be solar-powered using energy 
collected from the common house, which 
will provide resources that community members will share. There will be a laun-
dry room, a large kitchen and dining room, 
along with a playroom for the children.
The community will also have a pool, garden, playground and a paved area 
where the children can “play ball and ride 
their Hot Wheels,” he said.
Cheryl Kaplan described the living sit-uation like an “extended family.”
“It’s the kind of place where if someone 
breaks their leg, the entire neighborhood flocks to their side,” she said.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MARCH 18, 2014

St. Patrick’s Day celebrations 
often include a dash of beer — but 
not usually in soap form.
UF chemistry senior Katrina 
Benzrihem’s soap making busi-ness, Lather and Suds Soaps, of-fered a 25-percent discount for the holiday on a new soap. Called The Drunken Irishman, it includes ba-sil and a half-ounce of malt beer.
“It’s more of a masculine 
soap,” she said. “I thought a lot 
of women buy my soaps, so this is 
actually a tobacco bay leaf scent.  It’s a bit musky.”
Benzrihem, 21, said she first thought of soap-making a year ago when UF’s Mad Scientists 
Club was brainstorming fundrais-ers.
Her soaps run from $2 to $4, 
with the average being $3 for a 
3-ounce soap.
She said her knowledge of 
chemistry has helped her with her creative processes. After all, soap 
is made through simple chemical 
reactions.
“You have to be creative when 
you mess up, but the best part is you can’t really waste it,” she said. “You melt it back down, and you start all over.”
Genevieve Comeau, a 20-year-
old UF entomology junior and president of the Mad Scientists Club, said she’s impressed with 
what Benzrihem has produced.

done,” she said. “Art and science

� IT PASSED UNANIMOUSLY IN A COMMITTEE.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE — A Florida Senate committee has 
approved a bill that tweaks the state’s controversial 
“Stand Your Ground” law.
The adjustments include allowing local law enforce-
ment to set guidelines for neighborhood watch organi-
zations, clarifying immunity and who can use a stand 
your ground defense and letting law enforcement con-duct its investigations even when the law is being used.
The bill is co-sponsored by Sen. David Simmons, R-
Altamonte Springs, and Sen. Chris Smith, D-Fort Lau-derdale.
The bill has now been approved by two Senate com-
mittees and must go through two more before it reaches the floor. The Community Affairs committee is the next 
stop.
The legislation passed unanimously Monday, de-
spite being a topic that traditionally splits down party 
lines. The NRA, represented by Marion Hammer, even supported the changes.‘Stand Your 
Ground’ tweak 
gains tractionPlans are inspired by Disney’s World of Color
sented the idea during a Gator Robotics 
club meeting.
“My biggest challenge is finding 
published diagrams of projects similar to this to get ideas,” Rehmani said. “Dis-
ney didn’t publish any blueprints of the 
World of Color show, so I’m kind of on my own when it comes to finding the best way to make it work.”
Eric Schwartz, a UF engineering pro-
fessor and Gator Robotics faculty ad-viser, said he’s worried about the foun-tain’s durability. 
“I believe that it could be done, but 
I don’t know whether they have capa-bilities to do it right,” he said. “If they can make it work, that’s great. But will 
it work for a week, a month or seven 
years?”
Ferguson said he’s confident stu-dents will be able execute the project 
and save UF money. 
By collaborating with students in-
stead of big companies, he said, he 
expects to lower the budget to about $250,000. He is looking to finance the project through Student Government, alumni or corporate sponsors.
“We could have bought a fountain 
for $1 million, but if we build it as stu-
dents, it is worth a lot more than that,” 
Ferguson said. “So we are able to cut the budget and showcase just what Gators are capable of.”FOUNTAIN , from page 1
Increased research funding helped the rank
research grants at both the national and local levels. The col-
lege has revamped an office specifically designed for writing and submitting grant proposals and managing grants, Dana said.   
“We have increased our research funding for six con-
secutive years,” Dana said. “That’s something we are really proud of.”
But Dana said an area that could be improved is the fac-
ulty-student ratio.
“We are already conducting searches for those faculty,” 
Dana said.
Stephanie Dhue, a UF graduate student studying special education, agreed the ratio could be im-proved.
“Having graduate students teach us is 
sometimes frustrating,” she said. “But our small class sizes give us a lot of opportu-nity for group projects and collaboration, 
so it works.”
Dana said he thinks UF can also im-
prove the selectivity of doctoral students, 
which is based off acceptance rates and 
average GRE scores.
“Our selectivity is not as high as peers around us,” Dana 
said. “This could improve our rankings, but looking at the whole student is more important to us. We look for a diverse array of accomplishments, not just GRE scores.”EdUc ATION , from page 1“You have to be creative

A GRANT FOR RESEARCH.

A UF geology professor’s new 
grant may put UF in the forefront 
of hydrology research for years to come.
The National Science Founda-
tion awarded a grant to Thom-as Bianchi for research on the planned flow of the Colorado River into Mexico. 
The Colorado River is a 
heavily manipulated river, with many dams and diversions, and overuse of the water upstream has resulted in a dry riverbed in 
Mexico, Bianchi said.
Beginning Saturday, a con-
trolled flow of water, called a 
pulse flow, will be released at the Morelos Dam between Baja Cali-fornia and Arizona.
The expected rise in micro-
bial activity due to the pulse flow will release greenhouse gases, 
providing valuable research that 
may contribute to similar events in the future, Bianchi said. 
However, Bianchi will specifi-
cally measure the region’s effects on water chemistry.
The NSF chose to fund this 
project because of the relevance of the research to both the U.S. and Mexico. Bianchi’s team will be traveling with Mexican scien-tists to better understand the im-pact of the event.
The Colorado River Project is timely for Bianchi, who published a book called “Biogeochemical Dynamics at Major River-Coastal Interfaces” last year. He will be the lead principal investigator of the efforts that are funded by the 
NSF.
“This is just a small grant that 
we were able to get to be in on the 
first bit of the sampling, which now gives us an opportunity to take the lead to develop a bigger collaboration between Mexican and U.S. scientists,” he said.
Going into the field is Bi-
anchi’s graduate assistant Rory Kates, a 22-year-old UF history and geology senior.
Kates is flying out Friday to 
collect water samples with re-searchers from the University of Arizona. He will wade into the water with bottles for sampling at the site of the release and at 
six stations across the Mexican 
border.
“This is really exciting, really 
new,” he said. “It’s definitely an opportunity to really put UF’s name out there.”
But the importance of this 
project extends beyond UF, said Ashley Meade, a 19-year-old UF 
wildlife ecology and conserva-
tion freshman. She said conser-vation of wetlands is significant because they are disappearing. 
“The project seems very im-
portant and exciting because they 
will be measuring evidence of an 
ecosystem being restored,” she said. “It could mean great things for wildlife.”Professor’s grant

When the drive-thru isn’t fast 
enough, a new Taco Bell app 
will allow customers to live más through mobile ordering.
Taco Bell is testing a new 
app for customers to order and pay for their food entirely from their smartphones. The company plans to roll out the app later this year.
Bonnie Riggs, the restaurant 
industry analyst for the National Purchase Diary Group’s food service division, said this new wave of technology could come with complications.
“I’m going to say that it’s a 
great idea, but I think operation-ally there’s a lot of challenges as-sociated with it,” she said. “My 
biggest concern was how do they 
do this operationally without alienating other customers.”
She said restaurant owners 
would have to add a separate pick-up area and drive-thru lane if they want to follow through with the app’s claims of eliminat-ing long lines. Plus, she said, they‘d have to 
find a way to fill mobile orders along with the normal in-shop customers.

Gainesville is opening its first drive-
thru Panera Bread later this year.
Megan Sones, a marketing coordinator 
for Panera Bread, said the restaurant is 
opening on Newberry Road in front of 
what used to be Stein Mart.
“We’re hoping to have it open by July of 
this year,” she said. “We put it up actually 
very quickly.”
The marketing team has been looking at locations for the last year, and she said the spot seemed perfect for the city.
“There’s definitely a lot of people in 
Gainesville,” Sones said. “To get from Archer (Road) to Newberry (Road) can take 30 minutes if there’s heavy traffic.”Ordering via the drive-thru would take 
about the same amount of time as ordering in the restaurant, she said.
Sones said she expects a mixture of 
university students and residents to visit the new location.
“It’s right by the hospital, but it’s also 
by the mall, and then there’s all these apartments behind it,” she said. “I think we are going to have a nice mixture.” 
City of Gainesville planning manager 
Ralph Hilliard said it took two months to approve a permit for the building.“We review the plans to make sure they 
are consistent with our land development code,” he said, “and then (when) they’re consistent and get approved, they apply 
for their building permit.”
Sabrina Heck, a 19-year-old UF English 
freshman, said she thinks the drive-thru 
option will help alleviate the lines at the Archer Road location.
“That Panera always gets really 
crowded,” she said. “There are a lot of times where you can’t find a place to sit.”Drive-thru Panera Bread location to open on Newberry Road

NEW YORK — Researchers 
say they have spotted evidence 
that a split-second after the Big Bang, the newly formed universe ballooned out at a pace so aston-
ishing that it left behind ripples in 
the fabric of the cosmos.
If confirmed, experts said, the discovery would be a major ad-vance in the understanding of the early universe. Although many 
scientists already believed an ini-
tial, extremely rapid growth spurt happened, they have long sought the type of evidence cited in the new study.
The results reported Monday 
emerged after researchers peered into the faint light that remains from the Big Bang of nearly 14 bil-lion years ago.
The discovery “gives us a win-
dow on the universe at the very beginning,” when it was far less than one-trillionth of a second old, said theoretical physicist Lawrence Krauss of Arizona State University, who was not involved in the work.
“It’s just amazing,” Krauss said. “You can see back to the be-ginning of time.”
Marc Kamionkowski, a theo-
retical physicist at Johns Hopkins University who did not partici-pate in the research, said the find-ing is “not just a home run. It’s a grand slam.”
He and other experts said the 
results must be confirmed by oth-er observations, a standard caveat in science.
Right after the Big Bang, the 
universe was a hot soup of par-
ticles. It took about 380,000 years 
to cool enough that the particles could form atoms, then stars and galaxies. Billions of years later, planets formed from gas and dust that were orbiting stars. The uni-verse has continued to spread out.

welfare problem 
revealed
On Sunday, the Miami Herald released a chilling investi-
gative report about the failure of Florida’s Department of Children and Families in recent years to protect the 
children of drug users. The project is the result of a yearlong in-vestigation by two Miami Herald reporters, Audra D.S. Burch 
and Carol Marbin Miller.
In the past six years, the report stated, 477 children have died 
under the DCF’s watch — a number that far exceeds what was 
reported by the governor and lawmakers, the Herald’s execu-tive editor said. 
“The children were not just casualties of bad parenting, but 
of a deliberate shift in Florida child welfare policy. DCF leaders made a decision, nearly 10 years ago, to reduce by as much as half the number of children taken into state care, adopting a phi-
losophy known as family preservation,” one section of the report 
reads. “They also, simultaneously, slashed services, monitoring and protections for the increased number of children left with their violent, neglectful, mentally ill or drug-addicted parents.
“The result: Many more children died.”One case in particular demonstrates the department’s failure: 
In 2009, a 2-year-old girl was squeezed to death by her 19-year-old mother’s pet Burmese python. The DCF was fully aware of the mother’s addiction to various narcotics, and when child-wel-
fare investigators visited the mother’s home, they deemed the 
snake’s habitat — a quilt safety-pinned over the open aquarium — safe. The investigators then made the mother and her boy-friend, who lived with them, sign a piece of paper stating they would not use drugs in front of the child. 
According to the report, “‘While generally a safety plan 
would ask that the parents refrain from using drugs at all, ver-sus ‘in the presence of the child,’ the parents were unwilling to agree to stop using drugs,’ DCF’s quality-assurance review of 
the investigation later explained.”
One night, after the mother took an unprescribed Vicodin 
and fell asleep, the snake slithered out of the habitat and into the 
child’s bedroom. The mother’s boyfriend found the snake in the child’s crib the next morning, still wrapped around her body. 
This case, like the other 476 cases, could have been prevent-
ed. 
Rather than pledge to end the DCF’s malpractice, Gov. Rick 
Scott has defended the department, saying it complied with 
laws that mirrored other state laws. Essentially, he said, DCF in-
vestigators don’t have the authority to rule a home situation too dangerous for a child. It may bring cases to court and let a judge decide, but as the Miami Herald report stated, many investiga-tors simply don’t. 
There are no gray areas in the DCF’s mishandling of children 
in Florida’s child-welfare system: The department needs more transparency, increased funding and better management. 
Meticulously crafted reports such as this one from the Miami 
Herald don’t come often, but when they do, they affect policy and change. We hope, in this case, the change is speedy and the policies do more to protect children in the state of Florida. Male apathy: the tragedy in sexism ﬁ  ght
The reaction from fellow males to my column last 
week on the male role in misogyny at UF was quite revealing. 
Seeing how radically different the tenor of the respons-
es from men and women were from each other, it’s vital that we explore male apathy toward sexism.
But ﬁ  rst, we need to break down the sexism problem 
a little better.
At an abstract level, almost everyone agrees that sexism 
is akin to racism in that both are human rights issues. 
Despite much progress in certain areas, demeaning 
language toward women continues with no end in sight. 
The justiﬁ  cations seem fool-proof: “They’re just jokes. 
Take a chill pill or have a sense of humor. After all, we love our women.”
For years, we as men have shut down criticism of our 
sexism with “Let’s not make a big deal — why don’t you calm down?” These patronizing words serve to pain-fully remind women that male supremacy shouldn’t be questioned. It’s very easy to say, “Take a chill pill,” when we’re the ones responsible for — instead of having to suf-fer from — the misogyny internalized in our college cul-ture.
But when you spend your semesters knowing that 
there’s a 25-percent chance of being sexually assaulted by the time you graduate because of your gender; when you hear the discourse around sexual violence being clev-erly framed as just a women’s issue despite 99 percent of rapes actually being perpetrated by men; when you ﬁ  nd a naked woman covered in blood next to a Dumpster on Fourth Avenue screaming and repeating, “He raped me,” yet the reporting ofﬁ  cers could not care less about ﬁ  nd-ing the perpetrator; when you’re afraid to report a rape because the perpetrator’s social circle will shame you for being “ﬂ  irty” and having “led him on;” when you become frustrated that in the 21st century, it’s still not safe for members of your gender to walk alone at night; when you’re routinely catcalled various “compliments” on how your physique caters to male-set criteria; when certain academic and career ﬁ  elds are presented as “boys’ clubs,” tying intellec-tual inferiority with your gender identity; when 35 percent of men admit to having some likelihood 
of committing sexual assault if they were given full im-munity; when you’re a “chick,” similar to how an adult black man was a “boy” in the heyday of racism; when you live day in and day out struggling to restore your human dignity and not have your worth reduced to sexual or-gans — then you will know why women ﬁ  nd it difﬁ  cult to, “Take a chill pill.” 
I hope that living in a cocoon of male privilege doesn’t 
hinder us — men — from understanding why the outrage over sexism is legitimate and necessary.
There are men who are genuinely disturbed by how 
females are belittled in front of their very eyes every day but are wary of voicing their conscience. This apathy is intolerable.
Martin Luther King Jr. said the “greatest tragedy” 
wasn’t the “vitriolic words and the violent actions of the bad people, but the appalling silence and indifference of the good people” — he was referring to the white folks, who despite being sympathetic to the blacks’ struggle for dignity, kept to the sidelines during the Civil Rights movement. 
How long will it take for men to step up? To echo anti-sexism activist Jackson Katz: As soon as 
it becomes more normal for men to speak out against the degradation of women than it is for them to commit it, “We’ll be a lot healthier society than we are today.”

Ed. note: Due to its subject 
matter, this column uses strong language.
Corinne Fisher and Krystyna 
Hutchinson want you to know that slut-shaming isn’t 
OK.
In their podcast, “Guys We 
F**ked, The Anti Slut-Shaming Podcast,” they discuss, obviously, the guys they’ve had sex with in order to ﬁ  ght the stigma of being a slut.
The podcast “encourages wom-
en to feel more comfortable with themselves and everyone to have more great, shame-free sex,” ac-
cording to a Hufﬁ  ngton Post ar-
ticle.
Count me in for anything that 
spreads awareness of the negative repercussions of labeling others as sluts.
The concept of slut-shaming 
isn’t new. It’s a societal construct that shames women for how much 
sex they are — or aren’t — having.
It teaches women that sex is bad 
and reinforces the idea that self-
worth, in addition to your societal value, is based on your sex life.
We’ve created an impossible 
environment to succeed in because shaming women adds fuel to the ﬁ  re that is the Madonna-whore 
complex.
In that line of thought, there 
are only two options: Women can 
either be saintly and pure Madon-nas or dirty, sexually experienced whores. You can thank Freud for ignoring all the other sexual possi-bilities available to women.
This creates a world of sexual 
oppression for women. Madonnas are respected but cannot engage in sex, and whores are desired but treated as second-class citizens.
Essentially, there’s no way for a 
woman to win this game.
This creates an even bigger 
problem: There are no set criteria for being a Madonna or a whore.
Things would be a lot easier if 
there were an equation for it. You hook up with X-amount of people in Y-amount of time and then wham, bam, thank you, ma’am: You’re a slut.
But it doesn’t work that way be-
cause the label is highly subjective.
I’ve heard Taylor Swift labeled 
as such for having four boyfriends in a year, and Miley Cyrus called the same for twerking. Those are two very different actions, but ap-parently both can earn you the “slut” label.
Use of the word has gotten so 
out of control that you can earn it for almost everything. 
Basing the label on a certain 
number of sexual partners doesn’t work, either. 
My number may be higher than 
some, thus making me more de-serving of the label than anyone to ever have lived. At the same time,  my number could be less than oth-ers, making me an innocent Girl 
Scout.  I have never understood slut-
shaming quite simply because I 
don’t understand what is so awful about being a so-called “slut.”
Sex is healthy and fun, and as 
long as you are doing it with con-sent and protection, there is no rea-son to be ashamed.
Moreover, there is no reason to 
shame other people for what they do in the bedroom — or on the kitchen counter, living room couch or Florida Field’s 50-yard line. Un-less you are involved in the activity, 
it’s not your business.
However, this is all ignoring an-
other big problem in the slut para-
digm: Only females can be sluts.
Slut-shaming is a tool used by 
the — brace yourself — patriarchy to punish women.
The line of thought says women 
cannot be promiscuous, but they 
must have some sexual experience 
or else they aren’t desirable. 
Women cannot enjoy sex be-
cause that’s promiscuous, but they also cannot abstain because that’s uptight and prudish.
Men, there’s reason for you to 
stop using the label as well. It hurts you, too.
Freud gave us the Madonna-
whore complex, but we can thank a concept called hegemonic mascu-linity for this one.
Essentially, men have to strive 
for an idealized version of mascu-linity that isn’t actually attainable.
You see, masculinity is a frail 
thing that constantly needs to be 
reinforced. And “getting” a lot of 
girls is a great way to tell the world, “Hey folks, I’m a manly, heterosex-ual male. Look at my masculinity!”
So while women are told to keep 
their numbers low, men are taught to keep their numbers as high as possible. You see where this is go-ing, right? The math just doesn’t 
make sense.
If men keep insulting women 
for their sexual activity, they will 
stop having sex. This seems coun-terproductive to the heterosexual man’s quest to get laid.
So how do we ﬁ  x this? Well, we 
can stop using the word “slut,” or we can turn the label into some-
thing more positive.
I want to see more of these so-
called “sluts,” but I want to see them 
as happy, successful and respected individuals rather than ashamed and stigmatized women.
The world needs more ladies 
like Samantha Jones, who show us it’s OK to have a lot of sex. And if 
that makes us sluts? Well, so be it.

women are criticizedColumn
This is probably going to be an un-
popular opinion because I am sid-ing against the all-powerful Be-
yoncé, but give me a chance to explain myself. The iconic recording artist, along 
with other well-known women like Jenni-
fer Garner, Jane Lynch and Condoleezza Rice, has joined Girl Scouts of the USA and Lean In in a campaign to ban the word “bossy.”
In a video promoting the effort, Beyon-
cé says, “I’m not bossy. I’m the boss.” Now some of you “Beys” may want to call me the other b-word right now for criticizing your idol, but that’s 
OK. I would simply reappropriate the slander and 
wear it with pride — which is what I think people should do with the word “bossy.”
Now, Girl Scouts has a lot of good things going 
for it — Thin Mints, Samoas, Tagalongs, Do-si-dos — and, of course, it develops self-conﬁ  dence and good decision-making in girls. This “Ban Bossy” initiative draws attention to the sexism often at-tached to the word; when I Google the deﬁ  nition 
of “bossy,” the ﬁ  rst example sentence to pop up 
uses the pronoun “she.”
“She was headlong, bossy, scared of nobody 
and full of vinegar,” says the Oxford Dictionary. Using the word to primarily describe the actions of a woman is a trend that continues on Urban Dic-tionary, across the Web and in our thoughts and conversations.
“A 2008 survey by the Girl Scouts of nearly 
4,000 boys and girls found that girls between the ages of 8 and 17 avoid leadership roles for fear that they will be labeled ‘bossy’ or disliked by their peers,” according  to Sheryl Sandberg and Anna Maria Chavez in a Wall Street Journal article.
However, I don’t think this gender gap is go-
ing to be closed by eliminating a word from our lexicon. There will always be other words people can use to belittle assertive wom-en, such as “emotional,” “shrill,” “high-strung,” etc.
Instead, I think we should fol-
low in the less majestic footsteps 
of another feminist icon and fun-
ny gal, Tina Fey. Fey owns her bossiness rather than banishing it; she even titled her memoir, “Bossypants,” in which she ad-vises, “Don’t waste your energy 
trying to educate or change opinions; go over, un-der, through, and opinions will change organically when you’re the boss. Or they won’t. Who cares? 
Do your thing, and don’t care if they like it.”
Rather than ridding our language of a word, we 
should try to change the perception of it. This has 
been done with other words that have previously been used negatively but have now been adapted into positive terms, such as “nerd” and “geek.”
Similarly with “bossy,” when I Google “nerd,” 
deﬁ  nitions often use example sentences with the pronoun “he.” 
“Nerd” has been primarily used to mock boys 
with less-than-impressive physiques and athletic prowess who are more interested in academic pur-suits, but lately this image has transformed. Now, when I think of nerds, I think less Steve Urkel of “Family Matters,” and more of John and Hank Green of Nerdﬁ  ghters, Wired magazine, Steve Jobs, “Doctor Who” and Natalie Portman wearing a “Star Wars” shirt. I would say being a nerd is 
even trendy.
So no matter what someone calls you, you can 
choose how you wish to perceive that label. 
As Beyoncé once said, “Your self-worth is de-
termined by you. You don’t have to depend on 
someone telling you who you are.”

The HBO original series “True Detective” had its season ﬁ  nale March 9, and 
fans went crazy analyzing it. The story centers around two detec-
tives, Marty Hart and Rust Cohle. 
The two were assigned as part-ners in 1995 when a mysterious homicide, indicative of cult ac-tions, led them down dark paths to solve the case. The series takes place over 17 years. 
Life’s ups and downs take 
their tolls on Hart and Cohle. As 
the series progresses, viewers see 
the drastic changes in their re-lationships with each other and with their loved ones. Warning: spoilers ahead. 
Prostitutes, strippers, nagging 
wives, mistresses and corpses: 
These are the adult women of 
“True Detective.” While it seems unfair that women in the show get a bad rap, the truth of the matter is that the show centers on Hart and Cohle and their mission to solve a case while also trying to keep their lives from falling apart. However, it seems, in this show, a woman can’t keep her crap to-gether long enough to not get 
metaphorically kicked down by 
a man. 
This is the most apparent in 
Maggie Hart, Marty’s beautiful wife. Out of all of the women in the show, the audience gets the most complete story about her character. In her conversations with other characters, she seems 
like a woman with a great head on her shoulders. However, when 
it comes to her relationship with her husband, she turns a blind eye to all the red ﬂ  ags he continu-ously throws up. 
While the audience and even 
Cohle become aware of Marty’s affairs with younger women, 
Maggie needs the evidence com-
pletely spelled out for her before she really takes any action against her husband. She leaves him but only temporarily. A matter of months pass before she reconciles 
with her husband. You can’t teach 
an old dog new tricks, so Marty cheats on Maggie again. She ﬁ  -nally leaves him, but not before she runs over to Cohle’s house and has the world’s fastest re-venge sex. The message: Maggie was docile, purposefully ignorant and driven into spite. This is the 
classic misogynistic depiction of 
women since early history.
Furthermore, Hart and Cohle 
work for the Louisiana state po-lice, and yet the only woman working there is Marty’s secre-tary. She is a vivacious, curvy black woman who calls everyone “Honey” and “Sweetie” and of-fers the men coffee every day. No female ofﬁ  cers are ever seen. 
The last woman we are intro-
duced to in the series is the aunt/girlfriend of Errol Childress, the 
main antagonist of the series, who 
is inbred and mentally unstable. She is sexually and emotionally exploited by Errol and is no more than a piece of scenery that helps explain Errol’s twisted way of life.
When all is said and done in 
“True Detective,” women don’t 
ever “save the day” or do any-
thing of importance besides make things worse. Since the series fo-cuses more on the relationships people have with one another than with the crimes, I would go as far as to say the viewers see 
women through the eyes of the 
southern cops, Cohle and Hart. 
The duo becomes self-in-
volved, and they alienate them-selves from their loved ones; in return, the audience experiences a similar effect. 
It would be more comforting 
to know the writers purposely portrayed women in negative ways rather than them uninten-
tionally disrespecting women. If 
there is a “True Detective” sea-son 2, hopefully the writing staff will ﬁ  gure out a way to wriggle in a strong female character that doesn’t get the life sucked out of her by a male character.

� THE NEW TEST WON’T 
BE ADOPTED UNTIL NEXT YEAR. 
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE — Florida 
is ready to part ways with the 
Florida Comprehensive Assess-ment Test.
Pam Stewart, the state’s 
education commissioner, an-nounced Monday that she has approved a six-year contract with a not-for-profit outfit to develop a new test students will be required to take a year from now.
Stewart’s decision to ap-
prove the $220 million contract 
with American Institutes for 
Research marks another sig-nificant step toward the state’s transition away from the FCAT, which has drawn both praise and scorn for the way it trans-formed public schools.
The new tests will include 
more than the multiple-choice 
questions that are the frame-
work for many standardized tests, including the FCAT. The commissioner also said Mon-day that students will use paper and pencil to complete the tests initially, but schools will gradu-ally transition to online tests.
In a letter sent to principals 
Monday, Stewart said students will be asked to create graphs, interact with test content and “write and respond in different ways than they would on tra-ditional tests.” She added that the new questions will assess higher order thinking skills that are part of the higher expecta-
tions included in the state’s 
new standards.
Former Gov. Jeb Bush made 
the FCAT the centerpiece of his A-through-F school grading system. Test results were not only used to evaluate schools but also to determine whether third-graders should be held 
back and whether high school students were ready to gradu-
ate. Debate over the FCAT even triggered a change in state law about when the school year would start.
The new test, which does 
not yet have a name, will be based on a new set of standards from the contentious Common Core State Standards. Florida officials tweaked the math and English standards earlier this year to include items like a re-quirement for cursive writing. But this change has not ended 
the backlash against Common 
Core.
Florida was initially part of 
a national consortium devel-oping a Common Core test, but the state pulled out of the Partnership for Assessment of College and Career Readiness 
at the urging of Gov. Rick Scott 
and legislative leaders.
The group selected Monday 
has ties to a different national consortium that is developing its own Common Core test, but Stewart insisted the new test will be specific to Florida. She did note, however, that the 
types of questions used on the 
test were being tried out first this year in the state of Utah.
Randy Osborne, who works 
with the group Florida Parents Against Common Core, called the new testing vendor an “evil twin” to the previous group the state worked with.
“We can call it what we 
want, call it what we may,” Osborne said. “We can call it 
Florida standards. I call it put-
ting lipstick on a pig.”
When Florida first adopted 
Common Core standards, one of the arguments in its favor was that it would allow parents to compare how Florida stu-dents compared to students in other states. Stewart, however, 
said there would be advantages 
to the new test, including that it would take less time than the one developed by the national consortium and could be given later in the school year.Fla. chooses new

Obsessive Facebook habits were  
linked to disordered eating in a 
new study from Florida State Uni-versity. 
The study, published in the In-
ternational Journal of Eating Disor-ders, found that certain Facebook behaviors, such as focusing on receiving “likes” and comments and obsessively untagging pho-tos, could potentially be indicators of distorted self-image and disor-dered eating.
“If you don’t get the ‘likes’ or 
the comments, you feel like those in your network don’t think you look good,” said Andrew Selepak, director of UF’s Master of Arts and Communications program with a specialization in social media. “It’s a modern issue and one that contin-ues to get worse.”
In the study, researchers as-
sessed the eating habits and Inter-net usage patterns of 960 female college students by having them complete a questionnaire. Then, a smaller sample of 84 women from 
that group were selected for anoth-
er experiment.
Researchers asked some of the 
participants to log in to Facebook for 20 minutes while the others looked at different websites, ac-cording to the study. Afterward, participants were asked about their 
preoccupation with their bodies.
In both experiments, results showed that participants who 
spent more time on Facebook gen-erally had higher disordered eating scores, particularly those who un-
tagged pictures and showed greater 
concern with receiving “likes” and comments.
Jim Probert, a licensed psy-
chologist at UF’s Counseling and Wellness Center, said part of the problem may be the natural human need for social support and valida-tion from others.
“If someone is struggling to have 
more heart-to-heart connection with people,” Probert said, “then maybe those kind of forms of vali-dation become more important.”
Autumn Barker, a 21-year-old 
UF English senior, said she thinks Facebook is a means for users to seek the approval of their peers.
“We want to be important in 
other people’s opinion,” she said. “If we don’t get those ‘likes’ or comments, we don’t get that ap-proval.”FSU study finds links between body

� THE MONTH CELEBRATES THE 
STRENGTH OF AND PROGRESS MADE BY THE LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY.
JANA BERKOWITZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
Pride Awareness Month at UF, cited as the 
largest student-run LGBTQ+ series of events 
and celebrations in the country, kicked off Monday night.
Executive director Shawn Janetzke said the 
goal of the monthlong event is to celebrate and bask in the progress the LGBTQ+ community has made and to celebrate its strength.
“For a school in the South, we have an 
overwhelming amount of support from the administration, Student Government and the Gainesville community,” Janetzke said.  
This is the first year that Pride Awareness 
Month has been intentional in giving under-represented parts of the LGBTQ+ community 
a voice and a platform, he said. Dialogues and 
events focusing on the intersections of various identities are expected.
“We are making the typical ‘gay-only’ pro-
grams a thing of the past,” Janetzke said.
There are more than 24 events that will 
take place throughout the month, including the return of a free concert April 15, show-casing Mary Lambert, the female vocalist in Macklemore and Ryan Lewis’ hit song “Same Love.” 
Aldo Araujo, a 20-year-old UF public rela-
tions sophomore, said he attended the Pride Awareness Month drag show last year. 
“This was a great chance to learn about gay 
culture and how drag queens are such a large part of it,” he said. “It was definitely very eye-opening to see how awesome it was because I didn’t know what to expect.”
Araujo said he is excited about the chance 
to become more immersed in the LGBT com-munity at UF and to connect with fellow stu-dents who also support the cause.
“Being a gay student myself, I feel like 
I should become more involved in raising awareness in being prideful of who you are,” Araujo said.
Hiram Martinez-Cabrera, a 20-year-old UF 
public relations sophomore, said he has helped organize Pride Awareness Month in previous 
years and is a member of the UF Pride Student 
Union.
“In the week leading up to the event, your 
heart is breaking; you have Starbucks cups all over your room; you have bags under your eyes, and you have gray hair growing,” Marti-nez-Cabrera said. 
He said he enjoyed his time as a director, 
but as a spectator for this year’s events, he is 
appreciative of the other students and seeing 
what Pride Awareness Month means to them.
“This isn’t just a resume builder,” Martinez-
Cabrera said. “We do this because we love it. We work hard, we try hard, and the university really supports us.” Pride Awareness Month brings celebrities, drag queens to UF
� THE PLANE VANISHED 
MARCH 8.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
KUALA LUMPUR, Malay-
sia — Officials revealed a new 
timeline Monday suggesting 
the final voice transmission 
from the cockpit of the miss-ing Malaysian plane may have occurred before any of its com-
munications systems were 
disabled, adding more uncer-tainty about who aboard might have been to blame.
The search for Flight 370, 
which vanished early March 8 while flying from Kuala Lum-pur to Beijing with 239 people on board, has now expanded 
deep into the northern and 
southern hemispheres. Austra-lian vessels scoured the south-ern Indian Ocean, and China offered 21 of its satellites to 
help Malaysia in the unprec-
edented hunt.
With no wreckage found in 
one of the most puzzling avia-
tion mysteries of all time, pas-
sengers’ relatives have been left in an agonizing limbo.
Investigators say the Boeing 777 was deliberately diverted during its overnight flight and flew off-course for hours. They 
haven’t ruled out hijacking, 
sabotage or pilot suicide, and they are checking the back-grounds of the 227 passengers 
and 12 crew members — as 
well as the ground crew — for personal problems, psycholog-ical issues or links to terrorists.
Malaysian Defense Minister 
Hishammuddin Hussein said finding the plane was still the main focus, and he did not rule out that it might be discovered 
intact.
“The fact that there was 
no distress signal, no ransom 
notes, no parties claiming re-sponsibility, there is always 
hope,” Hishammuddin said at 
a news conference.
Malaysian Airlines CEO 
Ahmad Jauhari Yahya said an 
initial investigation indicated 
that the last words ground con-trollers heard from the plane — “All right, good night” — were spoken by the co-pilot, Fariq 
Abdul Hamid. A voice other 
than that of Fariq or the pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, it would have been the clearest indica-tion yet of something amiss in the cockpit before the flight went off course.
Malaysian officials said ear-
lier that those words came after one of the jetliner’s data com-munications systems — the 
Aircraft Communications Ad-
dressing and Reporting Sys-tem — had been switched off, suggesting the voice from the cockpit may have been trying 
to deceive ground controllers.
However, Ahmad said that 
although the last data trans-
mission from ACARS — which 
gives plane performance and 
maintenance information — came before that, it was still unclear at what point the sys-tem was switched off, making 
any implications of the timing 
murkier.
The new information 
opened the possibility that 
both ACARS and the plane’s 
transponders, which make the plane visible to civilian air traf-fic controllers, were turned off at about the same time. It also 
suggests that the message de-
livered from the cockpit could have preceded any of the sev-ered communications.‘All right, good night’ from 
MH370 came before shutdown

CLAUDIA STANTZYK-GUZEK
Alligator Contributing Writer
Wildlife specialists are worried about the 
potential impact of an invasive species of lizard 
on Florida’s ecosystems. Though Gainesville isn’t affected, students’ hometowns may be.
The Argentine black and white tegu has 
made certain areas of Hillsborough, Miami-Dade and Polk counties its home, threatening the local wildlife.
The lizards are part of an invasive species 
native to South America that can grow to four feet long and use burrows as their habitats, ac-cording to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
“They’re really smart 
animals,” said John Hum-phrey, a wildlife biologist with the National Wildlife 
Research Center. “They’ve got great eyesight.”
Tegus feed on small 
animals, eggs, insects, fruits, vegetables, and cat and dog food. The biggest concern is with tegus feeding on native wildlife, especially en-
dangered species.“We have a major concern for any of our 
ground-nesting species that might already be 
threatened or endangered,” said Jenny Keter-lin Eckles, a non-native wildlife biologist with 
the commission.
Gainesville does not have a population of 
tegus, but there is a possibility that a popula-
tion could form should the animals be released or escape captivity, Humphrey said.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wild-
life Services Florida field station in Gainesville is working to improve ways to capture tegus.
“It is a growing problem,” Humphrey 
said. But because of the small tegu population 
size, he said, there is more potential in its re-moval and potential eradication. The estab-lished populations were likely  founded by 
escaped or released pets, according to an FWC 
brochure.
Jesse Chesla, an exotic animal breeder and 
UF accounting junior, said customers may be uninformed when they purchase pets.
“A lot of people see them as babies and buy 
them as babies and never research the pets they actually buy,” he said. “Eventually they get too big, and they think the only thing to do 
is to release them.”Invasive lizard species impacts Florida counties, but not Alachua“Being a gay student myself, 
I feel like I should become more 
involved in raising awareness in 
being prideful of who you are.”

Florida’s historic Southeast-
ern Conference slate culminat-
ed Sunday in a league crown, 
an undefeated conference re-cord and a confetti bath in the 
Georgia Dome. After falling in the SEC Tournament champi-
onship to Ole Miss in 2013 and Kentucky in 2011, UF’s thrilling 61-60 victory against UK in the tournament final was an emo-
tional game and a triumphant moment for its senior class.
But that’s all history. Now, 
the Gators are back on the ground floor. 
Tonight, No. 1 overall seed 
Florida will find out its second-
round opponent — the winner of the NCAA Tournament’s first play-in game between No. 16 seeds Albany and Mount St. 
Mary’s. At 4:10 p.m. Thursday in the Amway Center in Or-
lando, the Gators kick off their quest for their first national 
championship since 2007. 
Neither opponent appears 
too daunting — a No. 16 seed 
has never knocked off a No. 1 in tournament history. But this is the first time in Donovan’s coaching career that Florida 
will learn its first opponent not even two days before the tour-
nament begins.
“This is a situation now 
where you’re starting off really from scratch where everyone 
doesn’t know each other and 
you’re trying obviously to get prepared to play,” Donovan 
said Monday during his week-
ly press conference. 
“So, there is an excitement 
for both teams playing some-
body new, but when you’re 
playing against each other in a league over for us, it was 21 
games. There’s a lot of familiar-ity inside of those games that 
are being played. Personnel fa-miliarity, what they’re running 
on offense, what they’re going to do on defense, what they’re 
going to be running inbounds, 
special situations, there’s a lot 
of familiarity there.”
In preparation for Thurs-
day’s game, Florida’s assistant 
coaches began watching tape of 
both teams Sunday night and will continue doing so on a reg-
ular basis until Thursday.
“What we may do on Tues-
day in practice is maybe look at 
maybe some similarities some 
things we’re going to have to 
do in both games that will defi-nitely be a carryover and work 
on those things, instead of get-
ting into, ‘This is what Albany 
does, this is what Mount St. 
Mary’s does,’” Donovan said.
“All of a sudden you’re in-
filtrating your guys with stuff 
that may or may not happen. 
And then inevitably you get 
caught wasting practice time on

After a quick two-game stretch 
in as many days at this year’s South-
eastern Conference Tournament, the 
Gators got some much needed time off heading into the NCAA Tourna-ment. 
Florida was named a No. 11 seed 
in the tournament Monday and will play sixth-seeded Dayton on Sunday in University Park, Pa.
“Getting some rest is important 
for our team,” coach Amanda Butler 
said. 
“ W e ’ v e 
got some 
people that 
have been 
playing re-
ally hard minutes down the stretch. 
Just getting them off their feet and letting them have an extra couple 
days is crucial for us. 
“We’ll have an opportunity to get 
some skill-work in, do some things 
we don’t typically have a chance to do during conference play.”
This season, the SEC featured four 
ranked teams at season’s end: No. 3 Tennessee, No. 8 South Carolina, No. 10 Kentucky and No. 15 Texas A&M. Tennessee and South Carolina are both top seeds. Florida went 2-4 against these teams. 
But playing in the nation’s tough-
est conference should prove to be beneficial for the Gators, who are set to embark on their first journey to the NCAA Tournament since 2011-2012.
“I think it’s a huge advantage,” 
Butler said. “We have to make it important. I think it’s a huge advan-tage to know, basically, what we’ve experienced since January certainly can’t be any tougher. I think it’s a great confidence builder for our team knowing that we’ve been in a lot of battles already that seem NCAA tournament-like.” 
The last time Florida was invited 
to the dance, it beat then-No. 16 Ohio State 70-65 in the first round.

Florida may have won its national cham-
pionship in 2013, but the 2014 squad is far 
ahead of its predecessor. 
At this point last year,  now-No. 1 Flor-
ida (9-1, 6-1 Southeastern Conference) had 
two losses under its belt with only one 
10. At the end of the 2013 regular season, Florida had yet to crack the 198 mark on the road and the Gators were recovering from their second loss — not the best way 
to close out a season. Now, Florida has 
posted the highest road score in the nation with 
a 198.20. The Gators haven’t tasted defeat in almost a month, and they have scored eight perfect 
10s this season. 
“We felt all along that 
the makeup of our team is absolutely ca-
pable of this type of competition at any 
given time,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. 
“Still, our team knowing that we can do better, which is great, because that’s the position we want to be in.” 
But Florida’s road to this high point 
in the program’s history was a carefully planned path. 
“We knew we started out extremely 
slow and that was our plan,” Faehn said. “At the beginning of the season through-
out the first month, not really worrying 
about landings and repetitions, and then trying to get to this position. Where every-one is really feeling the freshest and the 
strongest heading into the SEC Champi-
onship.” Florida ahead of championship team’s paceUF W omen’s

Soggy, windy and chilly con-
ditions did not stop the chance 
for former Gators to make their NFL dreams a reality. Monday marked UF’s Pro Scout Day, and 
general managers and scouts 
from all 32 NFL teams were in attendance to watch 12 former UF players. 
Having all NFL teams repre-
sented encouraged coach Will Muschamp, who uses Pro Day as a barometer to measure the sta-tus of his program.
“To have that turnout af-
ter the year we had it tells you we’ve got some good players in the program,” Muschamp said. “Obviously, [it was] an extreme-ly frustrating and disappointing fall, and that’s on me.” 
Defensive backs Loucheiz Pu-
rifoy and Marcus Roberson were 
among the hopefuls who had un-
derwhelming 40-yard dash times at the NFL Combine in February. But there was a silver lining — Muschamp says most scouts look deeper than what the raw numbers show when evaluating defensive backs. 
“Those guys play a lot faster 
than they’re going to run the 40,” Muschamp said. “A lot of the coaches and the comments I get from a lot of the scouts is that these guys play a lot faster than what their times are. At the end of the day they’re going to watch the tape, and that’s what matters.”
Defensive lineman Domi-
nique Easley — who suffered an ACL tear in September 2013 — did not work out on Mon-day, but Muschamp announced a tentative date of April 18 for him to work in front of scouts in Gainesville. Standout wide receiver Solo-
mon Patton finally got the op-portunity to work out in front of scouts on Monday, as well. He unofficially clocked in the 4.25-4.3 range in his last 40-yard dash. 
Patton did not get invited to 
the combine — something that 
he said was a letdown — but it 
allowed him time to work on certain aspects of his game. 
“It was real disappointing,” 
he said. “When you grow up, that’s all you want to do all your life — go to the combine. I didn’t get invited, but it gave me a lon-ger time to get better and work 
harder and I feel like I definitely 
got better.”
Offensive lineman Jon Hala-
pio also got to perform drills for NFL teams Monday. Some teams have been wary of Flori-da’s veteran lineman due to the torn pectoral muscle he suffered before the 2013 season. Hala-
pio said he was excited to show 
scouts that the injury was a thing of the past. 
“I wanted to prove that I was 
still strong, prove that I’m not injured anymore,” Halapio said. “I think I did pretty well with my bench numbers.”  
Halapio recorded 32 reps at 
225 pounds.
Linebacker Ronald Powell got 
the chance to further improve his stock as well. Although Pow-ell is excited to take the next step in his football career, he said UF will always hold a special place in his heart. 
“I miss everything about this 
place right now,” Powell said. “It’s not an easy place to leave, and it’s definitely some place 
that’s in my heart. I can’t tell 
you what I won’t miss about this place because I’m missing a whole lot of things.” Former Gators work out for NFL scouts at Pro Scout Day

Cassie Peoples drives down the court during Florida’s 81-76 loss to Missouri on Feb. 20 in the O’Connell 
Center. Florida will play sixth-seeded Dayton in the first round of the NCAA Tournament on Sunday.
Florida has three players who were on 2012 tournament team
Players from that team who still 
remain include redshirt junior Kay-
la Lewis, senior Jaterra Bonds and redshirt senior Lily Svete.
Those players will take an in-
creased role as guides attempting to navigate their team through the uncharted waters of the NCAA Tournament, unfamiliar ground for most of the Gators.
“All year long, we’ve relied on 
our leaders, our upperclassmen 
Jaterra, Lily and Kayla, in particu-
lar, who have got more basketball experience underneath their belt, 
whether it’s SEC experience or post-
season experience,” Butler said. 
“I would expect those guys to 
continue to do what they’ve done, be strong voices, model the type of 
work and attitude that it’s going to 
take for us to continue to be suc-
cessful and extend our season.”
Before the season, Florida was 
projected to finish 10th in the SEC, 
according to the preseason coaches’ 
poll. 
The Gators ended up fifth in the 
conference.
“It was a slap in the face to our upperclassmen, in particular,” But-ler said.
An X-factor has also emerged 
for Florida in redshirt sophomore 
Cassie Peoples. 
Peoples has shown a stoic de-
meanor and a consistent style of 
play. 
Although her offensive num-
bers weren’t glowing this season, the numbers she posted in the SEC Tournament may be a sign of better things to come.  
“Cassie’s a great player,” Butler 
said. 
“I think she’s one of the best 
point guards in the country, es-pecially young point guards. She 
wants to win, she’s a competitor 
and she has great confidence in her 
game. 
“Her teammates have great con-
fidence in her, so there was never a point where she stops shooting or anyone wanted her to stop shoot-ing.”
In the SEC Tournament, she 
shot a combined 10 of 20 from the 
field including a 7-for-11 clip from 
beyond the arc.

14 in the O’Connell Center. Spicer has competed in vault and balance beam at every meet this season.
Junior gymnast wearing walking boot to help sore ankles 
Faehn said the overall health 
of the team is the best she could 
ask for. 
“The key for them, and what 
we’ve done, is try to pace them the whole year,” Faehn said. “Let them rest when they needed to rest, start them out slower so that 
they’re feeling their freshest right 
now.” 
Junior Rachel Spicer was spot-
ted wearing a boot on her right leg after competing in three events 
against Missouri on Friday. 
“She just has sore ankles and 
so whenever we travel or whatnot 
we always just put her in a boot, 
that’s a really common practice ... 
just to keep them from continu-ally using that so it gives them a little bit of a break,” Faehn said. “That’s the biggest thing for her. 
When we have had those oppor-
tunities throughout the season to rest her, we did so.” 
Spicer competed vault and 
balance beam at every regular season meet this year and she competed floor, a notoriously tough event on a gymnasts’ feet, 
at all but two meets. 
Senior Mackenzie Caquatto 
has also taken a few breaks from 
floor this season. She competed 
floor at five of Florida’s 10 regu-
lar season meets. In the Missouri meet, which Faehn said would be the debut of Florida’s postseason lineup, Caquatto competed vault 
(9.875), uneven bars (9.925) and 
balance beam (9.925). Faehn said she doesn’t think Caquatto will compete all-around this week-end. 
“As of right now, the lineups, 
we’re looking for those to be just like they were at Missouri,” Faehn said. 
The Gators face a quick turn-
around with just two training days plus a walkthrough practice on Wednesday before a Thursday travel day. 
“Knowing that where we are 
right now physically and men-tally as a team, it’s a different team than the beginning of the 
season,” Faehn said.gyM , from page 13Donovan says team needs to shoot free throws proficiently
stuff that clearly is not going to happen. So 
what we’ll end up doing is looking at some 
things that we could get better at and then 
on Tuesday night whenever that game’s 
done, we’ll basically give them a first look at whatever team it is we’re playing.”
Without a certain opponent, Donovan 
said his team in practice would focus on cleaning up areas of its game it struggled with in Atlanta — most specifically free-
throw shooting.
Missed free throws almost doomed UF 
on Sunday in its conference championship 
matchup against UK, and its charity-stripe woes were prevalent all weekend. Against 
Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky last 
weekend, Florida shot 27 of 54 from the 
foul line.
In the second half of their game against the Wildcats, the Gators made only 1 of 
their 4 free-throw attempts.
“We’ve got to do a better job there,” 
Donovan said. “We were doing really, re-
ally well for a while there. One of the things 
that happened is we did work on it some, but we’ve got to spend more time on that. 
That has to be an emphasis and focal point 
for us.”
Donovan believes his players will handle 
the short span of preparation well. They’ve done so in the past with Thursday-Saturday turnarounds during SEC play.
“Our guys are accustomed to that,” he 
said. 
“That’s what’s really going to end up 
happening if you’re fortunate enough to move on and advance — you’re dealing 
with a one day prep even going into the 
next game. So right now, we’ve got two 
days here [Monday] and [today] to try and 
make some improvements in ourselves.”hooPS , from page 1316, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MARCH 18, 2014

The Gators could not buy 
runs against the Razorbacks.
Although Florida (13-7, 2-1 
Southeastern Conference) won 
its first conference series, it came 
on the back of strong pitching, 
not from an offensive surge.  
“We hit a lot of balls hard,” 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “I know we only scored six runs, but [the offense] was better than six runs.”
One- and two-run outings 
were enough for the Gators in the first two games, but they showed their need for better hitting in Game 3, when they 
fell behind 4-0 in the first two 
innings and could not make up the difference.
“I felt like we swung the bats 
pretty good,” catcher Braden Mattson said.
Hitting is not going to get 
any easier for Florida. Up next on the schedule is No. 2 Florida State (17-2, 5-0 Atlantic Coast Conference), which Florida plays tonight at 7 at McKethan Stadium. The Seminoles boast a staff ERA of 2.69. 
The staff numbers do not 
bode well for the Gators’ of-fense, which hit .200 with run-ners on base against the Razor-backs on Sunday.
“I felt like we were maybe 
one at-bat away from get-ting right back in this thing,” O’Sullivan said.
However, Florida will likely 
benefit from the return of one of its best hitters.
Outfielder Harrison Bader, 
who missed 19 games after being suspended following a scooter accident and DUI inves-tigation, returned to the lineup on Sunday and went 2 for 4. 
Despite the two hits, he did not 
have an RBI.
“Physically and everything, I was prepared,” Bader said. “I’ve been working hard. I’ve been getting at-bats and stuff like that.”
In order to drive in those cru-
cial runs, Florida needs its top-
of-the-order hitters to go back to 
their hitting ways. Both Richie Martin and Casey Turgeon went 0 for 4 at the plate. The hitters who followed — Bader and designated hitter Taylor Gushue — had two hits apiece but no RBIs.
But there might be a silver 
lining. Although the Seminole’s staff is strong, the Gators might have been lucky enough to draw a weak link.
FSU starting pitcher Peter 
Miller, who posted a 3.66 ERA in 33 appearances during his first three seasons at Florida State, has struggled early in the 
2014 campaign.

Gators’ offense struggles in first SEC series of 2014LAWRENCE LAGUNA
Alligator Writer @LagunaLawrence
There was not anyone coach Mike Hollo-
way wanted to blame for the sub-par National 
Indoor Championships performance other than himself. 
The Gators entered the championships as 
the top-ranked teams in the nation and could have become the first program to sweep the men’s and women’s titles since 2008, but they fell well short of that. 
Instead, UF had to settle for two third-place 
finishes.
“As the head coach of the program, I have to put this one on my shoulders,” Holloway said. 
“I have to get back to Gainesville, figure 
some things out and make sure this doesn’t happen again.”
Florida dodged a penalty at the Southeast-
ern Conference Championships in the wom-en’s 4x400-relay, which gave UF the title. But the UF men couldn’t avoid a mishap at nation-als, costing them a chance to finish runner-up.
Florida sprinter Dedric Dukes and Texas 
A&M’s Gregory Coleman collided on the final turn of their 400-meter leg, causing Dukes to fall to the outer lanes and Coleman to drop the baton. UF (impeded penalty) and TAMU (un-
sportsmanlike penalty) were both disquali-fied, leaving the Gators no chance at gaining points during the men’s last event. 
The women shared a 
similar fate.
Because point-leader 
Georgia did not have any-
one competing in the 4x4, Florida had a chance 
to wrap up a women’s title in the final event.
Florida finished last, allowing Oregon and 
Texas to jump above them in team standings.
After owning what seemed to be the entire 
indoor season, the Gators fell to a nadir they 
are not used to and concluded the indoor cam-paign on a stale note. 
Most teams would be satisfied with a po-
dium finish and leaving the heat of competi-tion with some hardware, but Holloway and his program aren’t used to getting third place. 
They expect better.“I suppose a lot of people would be happy 
or satisfied with two top-three teams in the country,” Holloway said. “But that’s not what we’re about.
“We’re going to get back to work and get 
higher on that podium next time.”
Luckily for Florida, the Gators have a natu-
ral shot at redemption — the outdoor season, which begins Friday.
“At the end of the day, we have to find a 
way to make sure we flip that switch so our passion and intensity and pride will be bet-ter,” Holloway said.
