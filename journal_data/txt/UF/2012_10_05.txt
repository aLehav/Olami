 For Jordan Reed, the journey to success didn’t 
begin with long days on the football ﬁ  eld.
  It began with a baseball tied around a pole.
  His brother, David, a wide receiver for the 
Baltimore Ravens, said the earliest memory he has of his brother’s work ethic is from their childhood.
  Jordan would relentlessly practice his swing 
on a “Hit-A-Way,” a hitting trainer with a base-ball attached to an elastic cord.
  “He would be outside at 6 o’clock, every 
weekend morning in the summer time hitting that thing,” David said.
  Jordan was driven by a lack of conﬁ  dence. 
That trait stayed with him even as he developed into a dominant football player.
  In high school, he didn’t think he stacked up 
against other top quarterbacks in the country.
  It was odd for Jordan to have that feeling, 
considering he was coming off a junior season in which he started at quarterback and led New London (Conn.) High to a state championship game appearance. He had also received a schol-arship offer from Florida and was the 10th-ranked dual-threat quarterback in the country , according to Rivals.com.
  His high school quarterbacks coach, Travis 
Meyer, was a ﬁ  rst-hand witness to Jordan’s con-founding inability to acknowledge his talent.
  “When he got offered by the Gators, he said, 
‘Coach, you really think I can play there?’”  Meyer said. “I said, ‘Jordan, you’re out of your mind. Of course you can play there. In fact, you’re going to be one of the best players on the team. You’ll see.’”
  Jordan didn’t like what he saw from his 
game, but he didn’t let that discourage him.
  His belief that he wasn’t good enough at 
quarterback was a factor in him developing into one of the most dangerous playmakers on Florida’s offense — at tight end.
  
     
    No one knows where the perpetual chip 
on Jordan’s shoulder came from. David said he and his brother have always been hard on themselves.
  “That’s kind of how we are,” David said. 
“We’re our worst enemies. We’re our worst critiques. We’re perfectionists. Any little thing is going to throw him off. (It) is going to make him feel like he ain’t good enough, so he’s going to strive for perfection. It’s been as long as I can remember.”
  Growing up, David said he and Jordan com-
peted at almost every sport, but not football. 
  Jordan didn’t play football competitively 
until eighth grade. His high school coach, Jack Cochran, knew the position Jordan would play from the moment he saw him throw the ball in gym class.
  “He had a great arm, so we ﬁ  gured we’d try 
him as a quarterback,” said Cochran, who was also the gym teacher at Jordan’s middle school. “He was always a great athlete.”
  Jordan took over the starting job at New 
London in Week 3 of his freshman season, which was the only year he played with David. Meyer said Jordan did not develop much dur-ing his ﬁ  rst year because he locked in on David too much.
  “It was awesome,” David said. “He would 
throw me the ball every time. I was his main tar-get, and we were pretty successful.”
  Meyer joined the New London staff follow-
ing Jordan’s sophomore year and helped him polish his technique.
  In their training sessions, Meyer focused on 
Jordan’s throwing and dropback mechanics. Jordan quickly proved himself as a willing stu-dent.
  “He took the coaching very well,” Meyer 
said. “He’s a great learner on the ﬁ  eld. He is the hardest-working kid I ever worked with.”
  Both Meyer and Cochran saw the pressure 
Jordan put on himself to improve as a quarter-back. He knew he wasn’t playing against the best competition in Connecticut and assumed he was not on the level of quarterbacks in high-school football hotbeds such as Texas and Florida. To compensate, Jordan asked Cochran to arrange workouts with a personal trainer, who Jordan would meet with every day for two hours after he completed his high school prac-tice.
  “In most cases, I’d have to send another 
coach down to get him off the ﬁ  eld,” Cochran said. “After practices, late at night, he’d be out there in the dark working on skills.”
  On Thursdays before Friday games, Meyer 
would have to stop Jordan from doing uphill sprints.
  The extra work and Meyer’s tutelage paid 
off, as Jordan developed into a more complete quarterback and led New London to the state championship game in 2007. 
  Prior to suffering a season-ending foot injury 
ﬁ  ve games into his senior year, Jordan was com-pleting about 48 percent of his passes, but Mey-er estimated that more than 90 percent of his throws were accurate. Receivers just couldn’t handle them.
  “If you tried to catch his passes, it would 
hurt your hands,” Meyer said. “Three passes into warm-ups, he would break a blood vessel in my ﬁ  nger.” 
  Despite the signs that he was coming into his 
own as a signal caller, it still wasn’t clear where he would play once he got to Gainesville.
  
     
    As much as he loved catching passes from 
Jordan in high school, David didn’t see his brother as a long-term quarterback.
  “I kind of told him he should play another 
position: tight end or receiver,” David said. “Cause with his athletic ability and his speed and his hands … I know what he can do and what he is capable of.” 
  Cochran also thought Jordan would be bet-
ter suited at tight end in Urban Meyer’s spread offense, telling Jordan he should consider a dif-ferent school if he wanted to be a quarterback in the NFL.
  The Gators’ coaches had different ideas.  “We absolutely did see him as a quarterback 
long-term,” said Temple head coach and former Florida offensive coordinator Steve Addazio. 
  During his redshirt season in 2009, Jordan 
practiced at quarterback. He switched to tight end during spring practice in 2010 after realiz-ing that John Brantley was the likely heir to Tim Tebow.
  Despite practicing primarily at tight end dur-
ing the 2010 season, Jordan was more produc-tive at quarterback. He caught only six passes for 79 yards but completed 26 of 46 passes for 252 yards and three touchdowns while throw-ing just one interception. 
Most of his action at quarterback came in the 
Wildcat formation.
    Fans clamored to see an offense built around 
Jordan in the Wildcat following an up-and-down season from Brantley and the Florida of-fense, but Jordan decided to focus on playing tight end after talking it over with offensive co-ordinator Charlie Weis.
  “He wants an opportunity to play on Sun-
days,” Weis said, “and he felt a lot more com-fortable about his chances at the tight end posi-tion than he did at the quarterback position.”
  Travis Meyer said he wasn’t surprised by 
the choice. Jordan simply felt more conﬁ  dent at tight end than he ever had at quarterback.
  “He called me one day and he’s like, ‘Coach,’ 
and this was completely out of character for him,” Meyer said. “He goes, ‘Coach, I’m bal-lin’ today.’ I said, ‘What do you mean?’ And he says, ‘I was runnin’ all over dudes.’” 
  
        
  Encouraged by how conﬁ  dent he felt at his 
new position, Jordan shifted his full-time focus to improving as a tight end.
  “He’s a guy that really works hard at it in 
practice,” defensive coordinator Dan Quinn said. “When he comes off the practice ﬁ  eld, he is drenched in sweat and puts the time in and works at it hard. I’ve got a lot of respect for him and the way he prepares and practices and goes against the guys.”
  Jordan already had an understanding of 
route running from his time as a quarterback, but his skills as a pass catcher still needed ﬁ  ne-tuning. Most importantly, he had to improve his blocking.
  “Footwork and hand placement, [helmet] 
placement,” Jordan said in the week leading up to Florida’s Southeastern Conference opener against Texas A&M. “Being more physical and tenacious.”
  Improved blocking led to more consistent 
playing time at tight end in 2011, when Jordan led all pass catchers with 28 receptions. Jordan said he continued to work on blocking with tight ends coach Derek Lewis.
  Offensive coordinator Brent Pease said Jor-
dan has reﬁ  ned his receiving technique and learned how to beat defenses since spring prac-tice.
  The results have been promising. Through 
four games, Jordan has caught 16 passes for 193 yards, including the go-ahead touchdown in the Gators’ 37-20 win at Tennessee. Coach Will Muschamp said in September that he wasn’t surprised to see Jordan’s production increase.
  “This is his second year of playing the tight 
end position,” Muschamp said. “The natural process is your ﬁ  rst year, you do however you do, and then you improve a little bit or a lot based on your dedication in the offseason. He worked extremely hard and had a great offsea-son.”
  Since Jordan’s permanent switch to tight 
end, David has seen one aspect of his brother’s game improve more than any other.
  “His conﬁ  dence,” David said. “He’s deﬁ  -
nitely looking like he’s getting comfortable at the position.”
  Travis Meyer sees the same progress as Da-
vid, and he sees it more clearly than he ever did when Jordan was under center.
  “If there was one thing that prevented him 
from continuing at quarterback it was … not be-cause he couldn’t, but because he didn’t believe in himself,” Meyer said. “But physically and mentally now, I think he believes in himself.”

Tampa may have Gasparilla, but Gainesville has been 
ranked as the “pirate” capital of the U.S. — at least in terms 
of illegal downloads.
The report, released Wednesday by Musicmetric, was 
based on the number of illegal downloads per capita by tracking BitTorrent downloads during the ﬁ  rst half of the year. According to a press release, the study tracked the downloaded ﬁ  les and locations of users, but not their identi-ties.
Musicmetric, based in London, measures and analyzes 
musical trends across the U.S.
Albany, Ga.; Fairbanks, Alaska; Lexington, Ken., and Tal-
lahassee came in just behind Gainesville.
Amy Landers, visiting professor of law at UF, said the 
study doesn’t necessarily mean Gainesville’s residents — particularly students — don’t care about copyright laws. She said because the study doesn’t track the identities of users, there’s no reason to jump to the conclusion that UF Gainesville ranked 
No. 1 for pirating

Volunteers hoping to assist police in the search for a miss-
ing UF student will face closed doors after Friday afternoon.
The Gainesville Police Department announced that after 5 
p.m. Friday, the volunteer check-in post at the Florida Farm 
Bureau, located at 5600 SW 34th St., will be closed.
After that time, police said they will no longer coordinate 
volunteer teams in the search and recovery effort for Chris-tian Aguilar, the 18-year-old UF freshman who disappeared on Sept. 20.
GPD spokesman Ben Tobias said when 
the search for Aguilar began, police used teams of volunteers to comb through wooded areas across Gainesville.
Now, the search areas have been nar-
rowed down, Tobias said.
“We are following the leads as they 
come into (GPD’s Criminal) Investigations Bureau,” he add-ed. “Additionally, there is a mountain of data that our inves-tigators are sifting through.”
As police ﬁ  nd new places to search, the department will 
send professional search and recovery teams to investigate, Tobias said.
“Anything that is found at this point of the investigation 
will be considered evidence,” he said. “We can’t risk the in-tegrity of that evidence being handled by anyone but law en-forcement.”

UF is among more than 100 U.S. 
and international universities that 
had records and account informa-tion leaked Monday by an anony-mous group of computer hackers called Team GhostShell.
Hundreds of thousands of email addresses, passwords, IDs and names of students and faculty members from schools including Harvard University and Princeton University were taken as a part of #ProjectWestWind.
Hackers bypassed at least one 
level of security in two UF sys-tems, UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said. The College of Medi-cine and the Contracts and Grants Department were affected.
At this time, UF is unsure what 
data was shared, she said.
“We blocked access to the af-
fected system, and we began a forensic investigation,” Sikes said. “That forensic investigation will help us ﬁ  nd what type of info may have been accessed and when it was accessed.”
Team GhostShell’s leader, 
“DeadMellox,” shared links to multiple mirrors for each college’s information on the text-storing website www.pastebin.com.
“We have set out to raise aware-
ness towards the changes made in today’s education, how new laws imposed by politicians affect us, our economy and, overall, our way of life,” Team GhostShell wrote in a statement Monday.
Clayton Pawlak, a 20-year-old 
biology junior, said he was in dis-belief that UF’s security had been breached.
“With the technology we have, 
they shouldn’t be able to do that,” he said.

students are to blame.
“There’s no reason to think that a college student would be 
less respectful of the law,” she said.
Landers, who specializes in intellectual property law, said 
she recommends avoiding all illegal downloading.
UF also bans peer-to-peer file sharing software on comput-
ers logged into UF’s network and restricts devices that have 
those programs installed, according to UF’s DHNet Internet Services website.“It is a civil and criminal violation of the law,” Landers said. 
“The music industry has been aggressive about pursuing law-suits.”
Glenn Bean, a 26-year-old fourth-year materials engineer -
ing Ph.D. student, said the findings don’t surprise him because there are so many students in Gainesville.
“It’s never good to be ranked highest for any sort of illegal activity,” he said.
Andrew Schaer, owner of Hear Again Music and Movies, 
said he feels let down by the findings. He said his music store isn’t doing as well as it has in the past, and piracy has been a contributing factor.
“I do believe that the people of Gainesville are good-na-
tured,” he said. “I don’t believe people want to steal.”
Schaer said students might download music illegally be-
cause they don’t have enough money to buy it, but he said that’s still not a valid excuse. 
“You don’t just walk into a place and take a painting off the 
wall,” he said.PirA ting , from page 1EMILY PADGETT

When it comes to the nation’s college 
cities, Gainesville is one of the best.
Gainesville was No. 4 in the small cit-
ies category of a best college town rank-
ing this year, one spot higher than its previous ranking and six spots ahead of Tallahassee.
The American Institute for Economic 
Research created the 2012-2013 College Destination Index by gathering data for 12 criteria grouped into three main cat-egories: academic environment, quality of life and professional opportunity. The rankings were announced Tuesday.
Julie Zhu, research analyst for the 
nonprofit research organization, said af-ter data were collected and normalized, the cities were divided into categories based on population. The top 15 ma-jor cities, top 20 mid-size cities, top 20 small cities and top 20 towns were then ranked.
Gainesville, in the small city category 
with a population of 266,321, was beat by Ann Arbor, Mich.; Madison, Wis.; and Boulder, Colo., according to the in-dex.
City spokesman Bob Woods said fac-
tors contributing to Gainesville’s suc-cessful rank included quality of life, its prevalent artistic community and the partnership between the business com-munity and UF.
“We think it’s a winning combina-
tion,” he said. “Gainesville is, quite frankly, a cultural mecca for the north-central Florida area.”
He said another helpful factor was 
the stability of the employment base in Gainesville and the fact that the city’s unemployment rate was lower than the state’s. He said officials are continuing to work on improving the city.
“We’re not resting on our laurels,” he 
said. “We’re continuing to work hard.”

The oil industry is brainwashing you
If you eagerly tuned in to the presidential debate Wednes-
day night, like I did, or if you regularly watch any major news network, like CNN, MSNBC, or Faux — sorry , Fox 
News — then chances are you’ve been brainwashed and you don’t even know it. I’m not referring to subtly slanted report-ing or blatantly biased editorializing — I’m talking about commercials.
Because my apartment complex’s cable service doesn’t in-
clude my beloved MSNBC, I have been forced to endure the painfully dull and contemptibly timid analysis of John King and Wolf Blitzer on CNN. During the pre-debate analysis, every single commercial break included at least one 30-sec-ond spot of propaganda from the fossil fuel industry and its brazenly vile lobbies. In fact, the event itself was partially sponsored — “brought to you by” — these dirty interest groups.
It’s likely you’ve seen these commercials at one point 
or another. They chieﬂ  y come from three speciﬁ  c lobbying groups representing the fossil fuel industry: the American Petroleum Institute, America’s Natural Gas Alliance and the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity. Together, these eerily inﬂ  uential organizations buy our politicians and manipulate the American people into supporting increased domestic production of fossil fuels, claiming that this will lower prices at the pump.
The reality, however, is that analysis has revealed that 
the “drill, baby, drill” approach of shamelessly pillaging the Earth of its natural resources does virtually nothing to lower gas prices for consumers. Just last March, the Associ-ated Press analyzed 36 years of data on gasoline prices and U.S. oil production in order to ﬁ  nd if the two datasets are negatively correlated, which would suggest that increased production does indeed lower prices. In short, the AP’s ex-haustive study found the opposite, indicating that prices are not signiﬁ  cantly affected by how many oil rigs are operating in the country.
“The Associated Press shows no statistical correlation be-
tween how much oil comes out of U.S. wells and the price at the pump … More oil production in the United States does not mean consistently lower prices at the pump … U.S. oil production is back to the same level it was in March 2003, when gas cost $2.10 per gallon when adjusted for inﬂ  ation. But that’s not what prices are now. That’s because oil is a global commod-ity and U.S. production has only a tiny inﬂ  uence on supply. Factors far beyond the control of a nation or a president dictate the price of 
gasoline.”
Another article published by Time Magazine in April, 
examining increasingly extreme new methods of obtaining elusive supplies of oil from sources like oil sands in Canada and offshore arctic areas, concluded the same.
The fact is, the oil industry is brainwashing you. It’s ma-
nipulating us into believing that destroying the planet and drastically accelerating climate change in order to further in-crease their proﬁ  ts is supporting a job-creating industry that will ensure you pay lower prices to ﬁ  ll up your car. The oil industry is a collection of the most greed-driven corporations in the world, devoted to putting its proﬁ  ts over the health of the planet and the sustainability of our society.
Last year, the two most proﬁ  table companies in America 
were Exxon Mobil, with proﬁ  ts of more than $41 billion, and Chevron, with proﬁ  ts of almost $27 billion. They make this obscene amount of money thanks to Wall Street speculators, who push prices up for consumers by egregiously betting on oil futures. In turn, they use their earnings to buy our politi-cians. So far this election cycle, the American Petroleum In-stitute has coughed up $816,866 in political contributions and has spent $3,440,000 on lobbying.
No joke, in the hour and a half or so that it took me to 
write this column, at least ﬁ  ve (!) of these scoundrels’ ads have run on CNN. Wow, as I’m writing this sentence, right now, one is running from the ACCCE (“clean” coal).
Don’t allow yourself to be conditioned into supporting 
the destruction of our Earth any longer.

Speaking of parasites, that brings us to the this-is-going-to-
be-completely-about-SG-elections edition of ...
Darts & Laurels
That’s right, folks. SG elections are ﬁ  nally over, and now we 
have to talk about them. A lot of colorful opinions were being thrown around this week by our “compatriots” at The Odyssey. We mean no disrespect, but a lot of us could see through your crap. We give a nice-try-buddies-but-the-referendum-probably-doesn’t-matter-but-either-way-a-majority-of-students-voted-”NO” DART to The Odyssey. We’re supposed to stick together, 
us members of the independent press. Maybe one of us isn’t as independent as we thought ...
We don’t feel that the ballot this week accurately reﬂ  ected 
the renaming of the Reitz Union referendum. At one point, the question was going to be a lot more informative, instead of the one-liner that we got. We give a we-mean-no-disrespect-to-the-Reitz-family-but-that-man-was-racist-and-homophobic-at-best DART to opponents of renaming the Reitz Union. 
Overall, we’re slightly displeased with how the Swamp Party 
conducted itself this semester. It lied about how many senators were also in the Unite Party (about 15 of them), and it prob-ably tricked students into voting for its ﬂ  ashy , yet unrealistic, platform. Like Christina Bonnarigo, former Unite Party spokes-woman, said during election results this week, “We are not go-ing to lose tonight. Losing is for quitters.” Indeed it is, ma’am. Just where is your former party now? Because if the Swamp Party is, as it claims, completely unafﬁ  liated with the Unite Party, then some quitting must have happened somewhere. We give a just-try-not-to-ruin-this-campus-anymore DART to the 
Swamp Party. Congratulations on your win. Also, you made a horriﬁ  c video called “Vote in a Box” that parodied a song that The Lonely Island produced in 2006. Way to be gross, irrelevant and supporters of bad ideas.
Kudos, though, to everyone who campaigned this week. 
There was no giant kerfufﬂ  es, and we saw a couple of dogs in T-shirts, which always helps. We like that kind of attitude — the attitude that doesn’t throw away copies of the Alligator or in-sult our staffers. We give a somehow-no-one-messed-up-too-big LAUREL to the Swamp and the Students parties’ candidates.
We are a little miffed that the Students Party only won about 
14 out of the 50 available seats this semester, but that is still a great achievement. Hopefully what they can accomplish with all of the other senators will be enough to convince UF students that change can, and will, happen. We give a That’s-What-Friends-Are-For-by-Dionne-Warwick LAUREL to the Students Party. 
Good luck this year, folks. We’re rooting for you.
While it wasn’t the highest voter turnout that a UF election 
has ever seen, it was still an increase from last Fall. About 9,197 of you voted this semester, which is so great! We hope that the potential difﬁ  culties of dealing with the different districts didn’t discourage many more of you from voti ng; Ideally , those kinks will be worked out of the online voting system soon. We give a you-deserve-a-pat-on-the-back-if-you-voted LAUREL to UF 
students. 
Stay safe this weekend, and try not to imagine what a real ga-
tor and a tiger would do in a ﬁ  ght. See you next week!

The Collier Companies 
apartment complexes across Gainesville tout slo-
gans such as, “We love our grad students” and “Welcome to the good life.” A series of outrageous pool parties attempt to appease the masses and instill a sense of utopia.
The Collier Companies, also 
known as Paradigm Properties, enjoys a monopoly in Gainesville, as it owns properties such as Hid-den Lake, the Enclave, Gainesville Place, Museum Walk, the Land-ings at Biven’s Arm and the Crossing at Santa Fe — to name a few.  
After spending the last four 
years in a complex managed by The Collier Companies, I can tell you that it’s not always a fun-ﬁ  lled party in the sun when deal-ing with the managers.  
While each complex offers its 
own incentives to lure students to sign leases, there are no real in-centives for apartment complexes to culture a bond with their resi-dents after the signing process.  Gainesville has a transient popu-lation of students, where every four years, roughly 50,000 stu-dents will come and go regardless of how complexes treat them.  
Apartment complexes know 
that they have power over this market, and I recently discovered ﬁ  rsthand that they abuse it.
Like many students in 
Gainesville, I found myself in need to sublease my apartment at Hidden Lake for the Fall semes-ter since I was graduating early.  The leasing manager made it very clear that she would not help at all with the sublease process.  
What an understatement.  After ﬁ  nding tenants to sub-
lease my apartment and walk-ing them into the leasing ofﬁ  ce, the leasing manager claimed that they would have signed anyway, and that I would still be held re-sponsible for my lease.  I later discovered from the tenants the leasing manager had tried to tack on extra fees onto the lease, which persuaded them to live in a different apartment at Hidden Lake.  
Hidden Lake then claimed 
that in order to sublease my apartment, I would have to ﬁ  nd tenants to sign a lease longer than my original contract.  
Infuriated and confused by the 
situation, I sought help from Stu-dent Legal Services at UF to write a letter to the complex.  
Are all these hurdles really 
necessary to restore common sense and morality?   
Although The Collier Compa-
nies boasts about having a prop-erty manager on site, it makes it as difﬁ  cult as possible for you to voice your concerns.  The ofﬁ  ce staff is trained to run interference by saying, “He’s busy with meet-ings all day.”T h e y 
will under no circum-s t a n c e s 
hand the phone to a manager.  
You have to call The Collier 
Companies’ headquarters and get them to forward your call to the property manager.  
When I did this with Hid-
den Lake, the property manager seemed apathetic toward my situation but did make time to laugh about spelling errors in the lawyer’s letter.  
This is the type of manage-
ment that The Collier Companies employs at Hidden Lake.
From a resident’s perspective, 
it seems as though the managers are blinded by the bottom line, and once you sign a lease with The Collier Companies, they no longer care about your concerns.  There is an inherent conﬂ  ict of in-terest when subleasing with The Collier Companies.  Why should leasing manag-
ers help you sublease your apart-ment when they can just lease new apartments and get a new bonus?  
Every time you sign a lease 
with The Collier Companies, you feed into this mentality and become a number in a massive apartment complex.  
I urge the thousands of stu-
dents who will be looking for apartments to avoid living at massive apartment complexes managed by The Collier Compa-nies.  
From my experience, the man-
agers at smaller complexes are more accommodating to their residents and easier to communi-cate with.  
Just make sure you hit up The 
Collier Companies’ pool parties and drink all of their beer.

ence and engineering grad student at UF.

Gainesville tow-truck com-
panies are frustrated, but not 
with angry drivers.
The Gainesville City Com-
mission voted 4-3 Thursday to send a proposed price hike for roam towing rates back to the Public Safety Committee. The same committee recommended earlier this year that the com-mission pass the measure.
The measure would change 
the penalty for parking in an unauthorized spot from $76 to $84. The city sets towing fees for companies that tow illegally parked cars, and this measure would only affect rates for cars parked in unauthorized spaces.
Some towing companies 
were expecting a vote on the measure Thursday.
“I think it’s bulls--t,” said Stan Forron, owner of Ultimate Towing, which spearheaded the effort to increase penalties.
The commission decided 
to send the proposal back to the committee because the city doesn’t have a structured sys-
tem for in-creasing the towing rates.
“We are 
completely going over 
the entire tow ordi-nance and making up-
dates and changes,” City Com-missioner Lauren Poe said. “My hope is that we are able to find a sound methodology for why the towing rates are wha they are.”
Forron, who has been in the 
towing business for 26 years, said rising fuel costs threaten his businesses’ future and said the legislative delay doesn’t help his situation.
“We can’t afford to upgrade 
equipment,” he said. “I cut my drivers’ pay . We don’t buy new trucks. We cut out health insur -
ance. We cut out all the driver benefits.”
Forron warned that if the 
commission doesn’t make a de-cision about raising the rate, he could be forced to crack down on illegal parking to make ends meet.
“What’s going to happen is 
towing companies are going to get more predatory. We’re go-ing to tow more questionable cars,” Forron said. “So park just a little bit on the grass or just a little bit over that white line, and we’re towing that car now.”

At about midnight tonight, hun-
dreds of UF students in lacy leopard 
bras and tight, trimmed briefs will cross campus for charity.
Lingerie will be on display at 
11:55 p.m. on Turlington Plaza for the 15th Great Underwear Dash, ac-cording to an email from an event organizer. Fully clothed participants will meet briefly before they strip down to run a path near University Avenue.
Left-behind clothing will be gath-
ered in trash bags and donated to the Saint Francis House, a Gainesville homeless shelter and soup kitchen. The event has occurred every se-mester since Spring 2005, excluding Fall 2010, according to the email.
Last semester, the event collected 
40 30-gallon garbage bags of cloth-ing. The record for the most bags collected was 45 in Spring 2011.
The Great Underwear Dash is list-ed as a UF tradition in the “F Book,” but Mindy Maconi, a 21-year-old sociology senior, said she and her boyfriend always try to attend. The two have been dating for four years, and the undie run was one of their first dates.
“It was the first time he saw me 
in my underwear,” she said, “so that was an adrenaline rush.”
Maconi said she leans toward 
polka dot prints, but for her first run, she donned a pink bra with black accents from Frederick’s of Hollywood and matching bottoms from Victoria’s Secret.
Maconi said she thinks the hype 
makes the event crazier every semes-ter. It’s not uncommon to see Poké-mon ball bras, Deadmau5 masks or the infamous thong from “Borat.”Students streak for charity

Gator fans can tailgate for a 
good cause with former UF foot-
ball players Saturday.Gamedayr, a collegiate sports 
website started by a UF gradu-ate, is partnering with the Florida Players Network, an organization of former UF football players, for a fundraiser at noon at 101 Cantina. Some of the proceeds will go to the Sebastian Ferrero Foundation.
Fans can take pictures with for-
mer players Chris Doering and A.J. Jones, eat, drink 
and watch the game, said Ricky Coston, chief communications officer of Game-dayr. Tickets are available online for about $50 and 
for $75 at the door.Kyle Newell, secretary and 
board member of the Florida Play-ers Network, said 40 to 50 former football players are expected to attend. Newell was an offensive lineman for the Gators from 2005 to 2008, according to GatorZone.com.
The Florida Players Network 
tries to give back to the communi-ty and help former players in need. Not all of them make it to the NFL, Newell said, and some may find themselves in tough situations.
Newell said he’s looking for-
ward to getting a chance “to hang out with the guys.”
“We all kind of have an innate 
bond, kind of like a brotherhood,” Newell said.

The Student Government Election Com-
mission issued a warning to the Students 
Party Thursday for violating election codes and campaigning prior to the correct time period allotted.
Campaigning began a week before 
the first day of elections, according to the codes. But Students Party Campaign Man-ager Dave Bradshaw wrote a guest column in the Alligator Sept. 24 that the commis-sion ruled as campaigning.
Bradshaw mentioned that this Sum-
mer, the Swamp Party passed new election codes he believed to be “absurd.”
Election Commissioner Marcus Powers 
said he believed Bradshaw’s inclusion of party names made it campaigning. All the commissioners agreed with Powers except Matthew McCann.
McCann said the intention of the article 
was to inform students about what Brad-shaw believed was a flawed system. Party information was supplementary, he said.
Mohamad Shatara, who also spoke 
on behalf of the Students Party , asked the commission to clarify the difference be-tween “campaigning” and “campaign ac-tivity” because the latter starts four weeks before the election.
The Students Party plans to take the is-
sue to the UF Supreme Court.
The Election Commission will hear 
more complaints Sunday.

Gainesville students and community 
members can swing back in time to enjoy 
dancing and music this weekend at the Flor -
ida Swing Dancing Club’s Gainesville Lindy Exchange.
The exchange will draw dancers from 
across the Southeast for a series of nine sepa-rate dance events which began Thursday and end Sunday. The last dance event — on Sun-day on the Reitz Union Colonnade — is free. The others range in price from $5 to $25.
Garrett Rodrigue, a 19-year-old aerospace 
engineering sophomore, said he is looking forward to meeting people from other areas during the exchange.
Seventy-five dancers are already prereg-
istered for the entire weekend, said event organizer Paula Cohen, and about 25 to 50 more are expected to buy tickets at the door of individual events.
Proceeds from the ticket sales will be do-
nated to the Gainesville Leukemia and Lym-phoma Society , said Cohen, a 21-year-old entomology and zoology senior.
Cohen said the charity was chosen as a 
recipient in memory of Bert Nelin, a retired professor of electrical engineering who died of the disease during the summer.
Cohen said Nelin provided dedicated 
support to the Florida Swing Dancing Club, a UF student organization open to commu-nity members. Cohen said he routinely came to dance and helped members raise money for new sound speakers when the old ones blew out.
“He had the heart of a teenager,” Cohen 
said. “He was kind of like our grandpa.”
For this weekend’s event, beginning 
dancers have no reason to fret, she said.
“If they pull one of us aside and say ‘Hey, 
I’m a newbie,’ we’d be more than happy to show them a few things,” Cohen said.

day will give recruits another reason to choose Florida. 
As early as next season, they could be the ones stand-ing on that ﬁ  eld, playing in a game of that magnitude. 
  “They come in here in The Swamp, and it’s sold 
out and packed and just rocking,” Hunter Joyer said. “It’s big. … It gets you ﬁ  red up and makes you want to come play here.” 
  Said quarterback Jeff Driskel: “I’m sure there are 
going to be recruits all over the place this weekend. I know if I was in high school I would be at this game. … This is really what the [Southeastern Conference] is all about.”
  With a combined 15-11 record in 2010-11, Florida 
hasn’t been able to present that type of atmosphere during the past two seasons. 
  Coach Will Muschamp was quick to downplay 
the impact a single game can have on recruiting — “If a young man is being determined off of one game, I don’t know if you want him on your roster” — but added that players and coaches live for games of this magnitude. 
    “You love to coach and play at a place like Florida 
because of a game like this,” Muschamp said.  
  Contact Greg Luca at gluca@alligator.org.      Now, onto the picks!
  Leading the pack with a 22-18 record is Rivals’ Bryan “Go 
big or go home alone” Holt, who recently utilized a public re-
stroom for a quick rendezvous. Let’s just say Holt did a lot of heavy lifting. For Holt, we guess it doesn’t matter if he’s look-ing at the tigers or the hippos. As long as he’s at the zoo, he’s satisﬁ  ed.
  Also in ﬁ  rst is The Associated Press’ Mark “That’s my 
chair!” Long, who was thrown off when some early-bird re-porters claimed his usual spot during Brent Pease’s press con-ference on Tuesday. Keep your sour grapes out of here, Long. Front-row seats are for the regulars!
  Up next at 21-19 is The Miami Herald’s Matt “Go home, old 
man” Watts, who months after graduation refuses to keep his snark out of the alligatorSports ofﬁ  ce. We got this, bro. Get out of our business. 
Rocking a solid 20-20 mark is The Palm Beach Post’s Ja-
son “I haven’t eaten ice cream for lunch since 2009, during a 6-month period when I just didn’t care” Lieser, who actually said that on Wednesday . We have no idea how to react.

During his recruitment, Omar 
Hunter was far from a lock to at-
tend Florida. 
As a five-star prospect and the 
No. 2 defensive tackle in the nation according to Rivals.com, Hunter had interest from many of the na-tion’s top schools. 
But after one visit to Ben Hill 
Griffin Stadium, Florida became the front-runner. 
“I’ve been to a lot of schools on 
different visits, but there was no place like The Swamp,” Hunter said. 
Even at UF’s spring game — the 
only live action Hunter saw during his recruiting trips to Gainesville — the atmosphere was enough to impact his decision. 
For the dozens of high school 
players expected to be on hand for Florida’s top-10 showdown with LSU on Saturday , the effect will only be magnified. 
“LSU in The Swamp, there’s 
not going to be a better atmosphere than this,” Hunter said.  
With National Signing Day ex-
actly four months from Saturday , coaches and programs are desper -
ate for ways to woo high-profile recruits.

When Madison Monserez first sees Ar -
kansas send a ball over the net on Friday 
at 7 p.m. in the O’Connell Center, her mind will be shut off.
No thoughts. No questioning. Nothing more than muscle memory.She and the rest of No. 11 Florida’s de-
fense are pushed to their mental limits studying film, perfecting drills and prepar -
ing in scrimmages under the supervision of coach Mary Wise. 
The constant repetition of these strate-
gies allows Wise’s players to replicate what they have learned during the week without second-guessing.
Monserez said simply reacting rather 
than mulling over a decision allows the de-fense to be quicker and more efficient on the 
court.
“The most important 
thing is not to have too many thoughts,” the soph-omore defensive specialist said. 
“A lot of people get re-
ally flustered when you’re thinking too much about it. We’ve been practicing 
for so long, our bodies know what to do. The most important thing is being stopped before the contact and, when it’s being hit, just go for it with everything we have.”
Nikki O’Rourke, a freshman defensive 
specialist for the Gators, said Wise taught her and the rest of the back-row players a technique called “eye sequencing” so they can react faster and smarter when the ball is headed their way.
“It’s just recognizing what’s going on 
on the other side of the net before you’re making your dig so that you can make your correct adjustment to the ball and figure out what path you’re going to read,” she said.
The Clearwater High grad said the faster 
pace of collegiate volleyball forces the play-ers to work out game situations in their heads before the ball is even in play.

Sophomore Madison Monserez (11) attempts a pass during 
UF’s 3-0 win against FIU on Aug. 24 at the O’Connell Center.
UF defense to be key against Arkansas
“Everything is much more in-
depth than I was used to, so that 
was a big change for me,” she said.
Wise trains her team through-
out the week — and even between sets — to anticipate ball placement. When digs become necessary, this skill will make it easier for the Gators to react. 
Florida’s head coach of 22 years 
said volunteer assistant coach Karl Miller regularly fed the back row hard-hit attacks in practice to imi-tate the Arkansas offense. 
“The game is so much faster at 
this level than it is in high school,” she said. 
“From the serve to the end of the rally, the ball just travels so much faster. So what we try to do is get the players to actually see the game three-dimensionally.”
However, the only Gator to crack 
the top 20 in the Southeastern Con-ference in digs is Taylor Unroe. 
The sophomore libero ranks 
fourth in the league with 4.58 digs per set. 
None of her teammates has more 
than 1.91.Due in part to its NCAA-leading 
.328 hitting percentage, UF ranks last in the SEC and 249th out of 328 teams in the nation in digs.
Because Florida’s offense typi-
cally ends points quickly, oppor -
tunities for digs have been hard to come by this season. 
The visiting Razorbacks rank 
third in the SEC in kills and put up a season-high 107 points on the Gators in their last outing on Sept. 14. 
Wise said her team needs to have 
a standout defensive match in order to preserve its perfect conference record.
“The good news is that we’re fa-
miliar with them,” Wise said. “The bad news is as good as they are, we have to play them again. We have our work cut out for us.”volleybAll ,

When redshirt senior Kat Wil-
liamson suffered a meniscus tear in 
her right knee against FIU on Sept. 2, freshman center back Christen Westphal lost her mentor.
But with Williamson, an All-
American center back, out indefi-nitely, Westphal has learned to fend for herself. 
Of Florida’s nine true fresh-
men, she has logged the most minutes — 84.8 per game — and has played the entirety of eight matches.
Westphal has been a key cog 
for UF in its five-game winning streak. The defense has allowed only four goals and 26 shots dur -
ing the unbeaten stretch.  
“It’s kind of like an honor, in a 
way, to be able to play with girls that experienced and that good,” Westphal said. “It makes coming here a lot better.”
When Westphal arrived on 
campus this past summer, the Cuyahoga Falls (Ohio) Walsh Je-suit High graduate immediately impressed the Florida coaching staff with her work ethic.
“She handles the fitness work 
that we do with very little drama, really no drama,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “She also has the ability to mentally push herself. She’s not just trying to survive a workout. She’s really trying to ex-ceed the expectations of the times we set.” 
Westphal said she never gets 
complacent during training. 
“They don’t promise any play-
ing time to any player,” she said. “If I was behind when I got here, I wouldn’t necessarily be getting playing time.” 
Westphal is still adjusting to 
the expectations UF coaches have for their center backs. Before join-ing the Gators, she played center midfield during high school and club competition.
She often looks to Williamson 
for advice.
“Playing center back here is a 
lot different than what I’m used to playing,” Westphal said. “She would explain it in a way maybe the coaches hadn’t. It’s kind of like if I didn’t get it, I could always look for her to explain it to me.” 
But since Williamson suffered 
her injury, Westphal has held Flor -
ida’s back line together.
“It’s pretty hard for a freshman 
to come in and play the center back position, because it’s a big responsibility position,” Burleigh said. “She’s not only done that, but done it with new playing partners once Kat went out. Her consisten-cy has been really remarkable.”
Westphal notched the first point 
of her collegiate career against Ar -
kansas on Sunday. On a free kick from midfield, Westphal recorded an assist when she set Holly King up for a header that gave UF a 2-0 lead in the 29th minute. 
“She doesn’t really get fraz-
zled,” Williamson said. “She’s calm and is really able to just play the game. That’s something that you can’t really teach.”
Westphal will lead the back 
line in No. 18 Florida’s weekend road matches against LSU tonight at 7:30 and No. 5 Texas A&M (11-1-1, 5-0-1 SEC) on Sunday at 1:30 p.m.
This weekend could mark se-
nior midfielder Erika Tymrak’s  (sprained left ankle) return to the Gators (8-3-1, 5-1 SEC). Although Tymrak didn’t specify the match in which she expected to return, she said she plans to play. 
Burleigh said she is making 
sure her team does not overlook LSU (5-4-4, 1-3-2 SEC), which upset Florida 1-0 last year in Gainesville.  
The victory was the Tigers’ first 
in 15 meetings with the Gators. 
“That’s sticking with me real 
close to my heart,” Burleigh said. “That’s first and forefront in my mind.”

Hunter Joyer feels he has some-
thing to prove.
The sophomore will play a top-
five LSU team for the second time 
in his career. The first time didn’t go as planned. Then-No. 17 Florida couldn’t 
contend with the physicality of the No. 1 team in the nation. The Tigers cruised to a 30-point victory in Ba-ton Rouge, La. 
“A lot of people still doubt us 
and don’t really believe in this Flori-da team, so I think we need to make a statement this weekend,” he said.
No. 10 Florida (4-0, 3-0 South-
eastern Conference) gets another shot to avenge its recent shortcom-ings against No. 4 LSU (5-0, 1-0 SEC) on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. 
UF lost 33-29 against LSU at 
home two years ago. 
“I feel we’re 10 times better at 
least,” Joyer said. “We’re a better team — together and as individu-als.”
The Tigers outgained the Gators 
on the ground by 125 yards during their game on Oct. 8 last season, con-tributing to an 11-minute, 20-second advantage in time of possession. LSU held the ball for more than 24 minutes in the second half.
“It was a game for us that when 
you look back, that is a hard one to go and watch,” Gators defensive coordinator Dan Quinn said. “They did a good job of coaching and play-ing and running it, and we didn’t.”
Florida’s loss continued an Oc-
tober losing streak that eventu-ally spanned the entire month. The Gators were outscored 120-47 by their four conference opponents. 
“We thought we prepared pretty 
well [against LSU], and coming out and losing in the way we did re-ally hurt,” Joyer said. “We lost some games after that. That was the start of it, the LSU game.”
Different circumstances sur -
round the Gators this season. UF entered its game against LSU last season missing both its starting quarterback and a consistent inside running game. Florida also lacked depth along the offensive and de-fensive lines.
With Jeff Driskel under center, 
LSU coach Les Miles sees an im-proved UF offense.
“It’s night and day ,” Miles said. 
“When you have a quarterback that understands what his role is and what he’s supposed to do, it just makes an offense more produc-tive.”
Florida ranks third in the SEC in 
rushing with 225 yards per game. The Gators have eclipsed 200 yards on the ground in every game except their matchup against Texas A&M on Sept. 8. Florida did that just twice before playing LSU last season.
“We can run the ball pretty good 
this year versus last year,” guard Jon Halapio said. “I feel pretty good going into the game.”
Because of UF’s glaring lack 
of depth, coach Will Muschamp couldn’t run physical practices last season for fear of losing players to injury.“We weren’t physical enough 
on either side of the line of scrim-mage,” Muschamp said. “We didn’t have enough depth on defense. You look at late in games, we were un-able to stop the run against good teams. Because of our lack of depth … we’ve got 300-pounders playing 75 and 80 snaps in the game.”
Better depth has kept Florida’s 
linemen healthy. 
Right tackle Chaz Green is ex-
pected to play against LSU after missing the last two games with a right ankle sprain.
Defensive end Dominique Ea-
sley , who has been dealing with swelling in his left knee, is ready to go heading into Saturday’s game, Quinn said.
Florida’s depth gets an added 
boost with the return of junior linebacker Jelani Jenkins, who is expected to play with a cast on his fractured right thumb. The coach-ing staff envisions 20-30 snaps for Jenkins against LSU.
“That certainly was important 
for us to get him back and be in the fold,” Quinn said. “Knowing that we’re going to play a bunch of guys on defense like we have, this is cer -
tainly one for us at linebacker and at defensive line that we need to be at our best.”
Saturday’s matchup between  
Florida and LSU will mark the first time the two teams have played in Gainesville while ranked in the top 10 since 2006. 
The Gators know the obstacle 
ahead. After suffering two straight losses to LSU, Florida is ready for a change. 
“For the players, there’s no big-
ger week than Florida and LSU in this kind of environment,” Quinn said. “It’s why all those guys came, why we come here to coach. ... We can’t wait for the fight.”
