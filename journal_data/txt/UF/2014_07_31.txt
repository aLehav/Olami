University Police arrested a Gainesville 
man outside Peabody Hall after he threat-
ened to hit a UF employee over a heated 
argument. 
Samuel Andrew Mutch, 65, was arrest-
ed on charges of threats of violence, bat-
tery, resisting arrest and illegal recording of communications. 
Mutch was in Peabody Hall’s Dean of 
Students Office arguing during a meeting 
with Laura Matthews, associate director 
of the Student Conduct and Conflict Res-olution, when he was asked to leave by UF employees. 
He then threatened to hit a UF Human 
Resources employee, present in the office, according to a UPD arrest report.  An officer heard the 
commotion and ap-
proached the office.
Mutch, who noticed 
the officer, tried to leave 
Peabody Hall but was 
quickly stopped. 
He argued and then 
bumped chests with the 
officer — hard enough to knock the offi-cer backwards. 
Another officer arrived, and Mutch 
was restrained by both officers, according to the report.
Officers were told Mutch recorded 
Tuesday’s meeting using his phone, ac-cording to the report. 
Police were also told that Mutch re-
corded a meeting about two weeks ago. 
After questioning, Mutch said he did 
record both meetings. 
Officers booked Mutch into the Ala-
chua County Jail on Tuesday at about 3 p.m. 
He was released on his own recogni-
zance Wednesday at 1 p.m.Police say man threatened to hit UF employee in Peabody Hall� FORBES AND MONEY RANKED UF.

UF made the cut in two lists naming the 
best colleges in the U.S.
Money magazine ranked UF No. 7 on the 
“Best Colleges for Your Money” list for public 
institutions.
“We know students, their families and 
others are more sensitive than ever to the cost of a college education,” UF President Bernie Machen said in a statement. “So this rank-ing comes at a good time and afﬁ  rms that the University of Florida is truly an outstanding value.”
Of the 665 schools ranked for “Best Colleges 
for Your Money,” UF took No. 28 overall.UF took the top spot in Florida, with Flor-
ida State University ranking No. 223 overall, 195 spots below UF.
Harris Krause, a 21-year-old UF chemical 
engineering senior, said that he likes that UF helps ﬁ  nancially struggling college students.
“It feels good that UF is focusing on mak-
ing college affordable for people, and I think that students do get a pretty good deal out of it, especially with bright futures,” Krause said.
Money magazine ranked schools in three 
categories: educational quality, affordability and outcomes, which refers to alumni earn-ings.
Forbes Magazine also ranked UF among 
the top colleges in the 2014 America’s Top 100 
Colleges list.
UF took No. 87 on Forbes’ list of top col-
leges in the U.S.UF does well in rankings for

This Summer’s student sena-
tors took on the task of revising 
the student body statutes.
The changes mostly updated 
the codes to bring them up to 
current standards and corrected 
past grammatical errors, said ju-diciary chairman Bronco Vusk-ovich, who co-sponsored these updates.In the 100 codes, senators 
made the Senate statutes avail-able upon request to each new senator instead of automatically. It saves paper, Vuskovich said. 
The list of exclusionary ofﬁ  c-
es in the executive branch, which are the heads of Senate’s various organizations, was updated to reﬂ  ect current organizations. 
The title of Affairs director 
was scrapped and replaced with Action SG to reﬂ  ect the group’s new name.Groups like Gators Going 
Green, Gator Innovators and Student Honor Code were add-ed. 
This is the ﬁ  rst semester in 
UF’s history where all of stu-
dent government is entirely 
controlled by one party — The Swamp Party.

Same Shop. Same bikes. New 
Paint. New Name.
Goodbike now stands in the 
same building where Mr. Goodbike 
stood on Northwest 13th Street.
The local bike shop closed ear-
lier this summer. But one of the original owners of Mr. Goodbike, 47-year-old Mike Hetrick, saddled up, dropped the Mr. and opened shop on the Fourth of July.
“I wanted to have our birth on 
Independence Day,” Mike said. “The shop was empty, but we were 
here with beer and wings and pizza 
having a good time.”
Mr. Goodbike originally opened 
in 2003 after Mike met former own-er Gus Woodard.
“We were both bike enthusiasts 
and thought it would be a fun way to make a living,” he said.
Mike and Gus worked together 
for the next 10 years, ﬁ  xing up old bikes, repairing well-loved rides and ﬁ  tting people to new bikes.
“I kind of like bringing old bikes 
back from the dead, rehabbing them,” Mike said. “And of course, I like riding my bike.” 
After selling his share of the 
shop to Gus in December 2012, Mike traveled. He went to big bike tours in California and Colorado as a USA Cycling certiﬁ  ed profession-al bike mechanic. But after a while, he missed his Gainesville roots.
“I’m going back to what I knew 
here,” he said. 
Mike started repairing bikes at 
The Cycle Shop while he was in high school. 
Before he could work in the 
shop, though, he had to work the hot dog cart. 
“I said, ‘Sure, I’ll push that joke around.’ And I sold every hot dog on there.” 
He’s worked on bikes ever 
since.
“I like the shop because the ser-
vice is great,” said Jabari Graves, a 28-year-old cyclist who frequents the shop. “Everyone is friendly, and they’re knowledgeable.”
Jabari started going there when 
it was still Mr. Goodbike because it was in his neighborhood. 
“I saw it closed down, and I was 
bummed,” he said, “Then I saw the new paint and new look, and it brought me in.” 
Goodbike is still the same as its 
predecessor in many ways.
It still offers a $25 tuneup. It still 
carries Kona mountain bikes from Washington. The row of bright Electra cruisers still sits between the shop and 13th Street.
And business? Business has 
been good.THURSDAY, JULY 31, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Cutting tree limbs is far 
from fun, and when you get 
stuck on a cherry picker while 
doing it on a hot July after-
noon, it’s downright miser-able. 
That is exactly what hap-
pened to two friends of Grant and Stacie Cooper on Satur-day, who live on Northwest 27th Terrace, about two miles north of UF. 
The Coopers rented a 
cherry picker to cut down tree branches in their front yard, and two friends came over to help. While the two men were 50 feet in the air, a blown fuse 
caused the machine to stop 
working, leaving the men stranded.
Initial reports said the 
machine stopped working because a limb fell on it, but Stacie Cooper said those were incorrect.“They were stuck up there 
for over an hour,” Cooper said, which happened just af-
ter 1 p.m, the hottest part of 
the day.
Grant Cooper — who was 
on the ground — tried to ﬁ  x it but was unsuccessful. After 
exhausting all of their options, 
the men called Gainesville Fire Rescue.
Once the rescue team ar-
rived, the street was blocked off and a ladder was raised to the men. Joey Gonzalez, a member of the rescue team, said it only took about ﬁ  ve 
minutes to get the men down.
“This is kinda what we do 
for a living,” he said, joking.
GFR District Chief Michael 
Cowart said situations like 
this are why people need to be very careful when operating large equipment in potentially dangerous situations. He said 
a tree limb could have easily 
fallen on one of the men and caused a serious injury.
“When you rent equipment 
like that, you better know what the heck you’re doing,” he said. 
But Stacie Cooper said 
there was never anything dan-
gerous about the situation; her 
husband even ﬁ  xed the ma-chine later that day. She said the scene was more comical 
than anything. Two men stranded 
in cherry picker, had to be rescued by firefighters LOCALBike shop reopens with new name

A leading recycling company UF 
works with has gone Hollywood.
UF’s Office of Sustainability has 
a partnership with TerraCycle, a 
recycling company that recycles 
waste that is usually non-recycla-
ble, such as toothbrushes, wrappers and cosmetic containers.
“We upcycle or recycle them into 
a variety of affordable, sustainable consumer products and building materials,” said Albe Zakes, global vice president of media relations.
Donors drop off items at Terra-
Cycle tubes located at all Gator Din-ing convenience stores on campus. The Office of Sustainability then sorts and mails the items to Terra-Cycle.
Schools and nonprofits earn 2 
cents for every piece of waste they recycle.Zakes said TerraCycle has made almost $10 million from recy-cling waste since 2007.
But that number may change. 
The recycling company is sched-uled to debut its own reality TV se-ries called”Human Resources.”
Each episode will be informa-tive and feature a different product, but it will also be a bit of wackiness, Zakes said. He and his co-workers like to play pranks on each other and have fun around the office, he said.
“We hope that that combination 
is going to make it both educational and entertaining at the same time,” he said.
Human Resources will premiere 
Aug. 8 at 10 p.m. on Pivot, a new network geared towards “socially minded millennials,” he said.
However, UF’s connection with 
the company will remain the same 
despite its potential stardom.TerraCycle is a starting point for 
people to become more involved in 
sustainability, said Joseph Floyd, zero waste coordinator for the Of-fice of Sustainability.
“It gives people an outlet and a 
way to engage,” he said. “There’s other value beyond the monetary factor.”Jessica Gervais, a 20-year-old 
UF biology and psychology soph-omore, said TerraCycle options should be expanded from the cur-rent locations.
“I think it might be an even bet-
ter idea to have it all around cam-
pus instead of just the P.O.D.,” Ger-
vais said. “Unless you’re there a lot, it’s probably really inconvenient to go all the way there to get rid of a toothbrush.”
However, Gervais said she still 
will start using the P.O.D. Market locations because the planet is more important than a minor inconve-
nience.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON — Stop sunbathing and 
using indoor tanning beds, the acting U.S. sur-
geon general warned in a report released Tues-day that cites an alarming 200 percent jump in deadly melanoma cases since 1973.
The report blames a generation of sun wor-
shipping for the $8 billion spent to treat all forms of skin cancer each year.
Rear Adm. Boris Lushniak said state and lo-
cal officials need to do more to help people cov-er up, such as providing more shade at parks and sporting events. Schools should encourage kids to wear hats and sunscreen and schedule outdoor activities when the sun is low in the 
sky. And colleges and universities should elim-
inate indoor tanning beds on campus as much 
as they would prohibit to-
bacco use, he added.
“We need more states 
and institutions on board 
with these policies that dis-
courage or restrict indoor 
tanning by our youth,” 
Lushniak said. “Tanned skin 
is damaged skin.”
The surgeon general’s “call to action” plan is 
part of a broader push this year by government 
officials and public health advocates to raise awareness on what they say has become a ma-jor public health problem. While other cancers 
such as lung cancer are decreasing, skin cancer 
is rising rapidly. According to the Department 
of Health and Human Services, 5 million peo-
ple are treated for skin cancer each year. And 
the number of Americans with skin cancer in 
the past three decades eclipse the number of all 
other cancers combined.
Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin can-
cer, with 9,000 people dying each year from the 
mostly preventable disease.
The Melanoma Research Foundation says 
exposure to tanning beds before age 30 increas-
es a person’s risk of developing melanoma by 75 percent.
“If only I had first gone to the doctor, when 
I first saw that spot, instead of ignoring it, I 
would have saved my family and myself ... the 
emotional, physical and financial burden of 
skin cancer,” she said. “It was absolutely over-
whelming.”
Howard Koh, assistant secretary for health 
for the Department of Health and Human Ser-vices, said skin cancer prevention needs to be-
come a bigger part of daily American life.
“We need to change the social norm with 
respect to tanning and shatter the myth that tanned skin is somehow a sign of health,” Koh 
said.Generation of tanners sees spike in deadly skin melanomaKYLE FOLLANSBEE

Gainesville Police arrested a High 
Springs man after fleeing a traffic stop, 
crashing into a light pole and running 
on foot Tuesday morning. 
Officers charged 22-year-old Fabi-
an Bashawn Jennings on resisting ar-
rest, fleeing an officer, failure to leave 
information with property damage 
and driving with a suspended license, according to a GPD police report.  
On Tuesday at about 2:33 a.m., 
GPD attempted to stop the driver, Jen-
nings, for not stopping at a stop sign 
and improper tag lighting, according to the report. 
Jennings then sped up after seeing 
the officer’s flashing lights. Jennings drove the car into the Uni-
versity Commons apartment complex and crashed into a light pole, accord-ing to the report. 
Jennings then ran 
from the crash as the officer followed on foot. 
The officer shout-
ed commands to 
stop, according to the 
report. 
Jennings ignored 
the commands and was eventually caught with the help of a K-9. 
Officers booked Jennings into the 
Alachua County Jail on Tuesday at 
about 6:03 a.m. 
As of press time his bond is set at 
$40,000. High Springs man flees 
police, crashes into pole
Changes were also made to senate constituency requirements 
tion commission members were 
also nixed. Vuskovich couldn’t be reached for comment.
Further changes to the election 
rules, in the 700 codes, included de-
leting several duties of the supervi-
sor of elections. One said the super-visor must “ensure that all students are notified of the absentee ballot process, via at least two forms of di-rect online notification, at least two weeks prior to the deadline.”
“The Supervisor of Elections 
shall ensure that all voting systems are properly zeroed and tested in the week prior to the election. The 
zeroing and testing of the voting 
systems shall occur in the presence of the group listed in 717.3,” read another deleted section.
Senate attendance laws, chapters 
323 and 324, were amended to reflect a more liberal policy on choosing constituency events, during which senators meet their constituents.
“It goes from a blanket where 
everybody has to do the same two 
events to a more targeted approach,” 
said rules and ethics chairman An-thony Sorrentino. “It’s moving to-ward an option where senators get to pick from a pool of potential con-stituency requirements.”
In the 500 codes, five Institute of 
Food and Agricultural Sciences sat-ellite schools were stricken from the list of approved representatives for distance campuses.
Chapter 621, regarding group 
seating, was deleted altogether.
Most of the updates were in the codes that guide finances. 
The major change was to the 
definition of the student activity and service fee to include a broader sec-tion of minority groups that may not be disincluded.
“We changed the definition of 
the activity and service fee to match 
the Florida statute,” said Student 
Body Treasurer Elliot Grasso, who authored the bill.

PORT ST. LUCIE — A Flor-
ida woman who let her 7-year-
old son walk alone to a park has 
been charged with felony child 
neglect.
Thirty-four-year old Nicole 
Gainey’s son was en route Satur-
day to a park about a half-mile 
from his home when he stopped and sat at a nearby pool, accord-ing to an arrest afﬁ  davit. 
Lifeguards said they had 
seen the boy ﬁ  ve previous times, and one approached him to ask where his mother was.
Apparently spooked by the 
questioning, the boy ﬂ  ed, run-ning across a six-lane road to-ward the park, where an ofﬁ  cer found him and asked if he was allowed out alone often.
“Yes. She gives me the phone 
and tells me to go,” the child told the ofﬁ  cer, according to the report.
Police then arrived at Gain-
ey’s home, in Port St. Lucie, and 
she was arrested. 
Police say she told them her 
son went unsupervised to the 
park once or twice a week.
The Rutherford Institute, a 
Virginia-based civil liberties group, received calls about the incident from some who see it as an overreach by law enforce-ment. 
The group reached out to 
Gainey, who is now being rep-resented by the organization’s attorneys.
John Whitehead, the civil 
rights attorney who founded the institute, said that if ofﬁ  cials were concerned about the boy’s lack of supervision, a warning 
would have been sufﬁ  cient. He 
said Gainey will not allow her boy to leave unattended again.
“She’s a good mother, obvi-
ously,” Whitehead said. “She wasn’t a neglectful mother. 
She’s scared, and she’s ﬁ  ght-
ing.”
A message left on Gainey’s 
phone was not immediately re-
turned.Police arrest mom who let child

Throughout the school year, students are rewarded for 
their hard work with occasional breaks from the rig-ors of academia. Following the grueling ends of each 
semester, we are released from the clutches of term papers, exams and presentations to spend a few precious weeks re-
laxing and recharging our batteries. 
Like UF and other colleges and universities, Congress 
takes lengthy breaks,  including one that stretches from the 
beginning of August through Labor Day. Sure, it’s not all rest and relaxation for members of Congress — especially during campaign season — but fear not: Many of them will take long vacations beginning this week. For all intents and purposes, Congress has done little of signiﬁ  cance this year, except point ﬁ  ngers, threaten to sue — or impeach — the president and 
generally sow the seeds of discontent throughout the coun-
try. In effect, they’ve done nothing. 
If that were how you approached school, would you de-
serve a passing grade for the semester or a vacation? Not likely. For us to earn (or deserve) time away from the grind of school or our jobs, we must put in some effort.
Many, but not all, members of Congress did next to noth-
ing this year, earning a sizable salary on the taxpayer’s dime, and now, they’re going on vacation. While sipping marga-
ritas on the beach, perhaps a few members of Congress will 
reﬂ  ect on the last few months — and if we’re being honest, years — and ﬁ  nally ﬁ  gure out why it is that a recent poll showed Congress is less popular than the much-maligned Star Wars character Jar Jar Binks. 
Progress in the U.S. is at a standstill, and it’s not the result 
of simple ideological arguments over the size and scope of the government: It’s the result of a Congress unable to do its job. A professor once told me that a president proposes 
and Congress disposes, but it seems that Congress cannot 
dispose of any proposal, whether that proposal comes from the White House or a fellow member of Congress. It seems that Congress members are so frightened of primary chal-lenges from the ideological fringes of their respective par-ties that they would rather let Congress act on nothing than compromise and look ideologically weak.  What led to this paralysis? Partisan redistricting is a likely cause. Here’s the quick and dirty: The 
party that controls your state gov-ernment controls the redistricting process. In Florida’s case, the Re-publicans have complete control 
over our Congressional districts. 
Recently, a federal court reviewed Florida’s Congressional districts and invalidated them, claiming that the districts unfairly beneﬁ  t 
Republicans. 
Not one person working in politics found it surprising 
that the party in power titled redistricting in their party’s favor. However, Florida’s Congressional districts don’t just 
beneﬁ  t Republicans. A Democrat that represents Gainesville 
has an unfair district, too. Congresswoman Corinne Brown’s district — which unfathomably stretches from Duval to Orange County — was also listed a problem district. As a result, Florida will have to redraw Congressional maps at some point in the near future, but certainly not before the November election. 
To give you a different perspective, Democratic Congres-
sional candidates won the 2012 popular vote by more than 
1 million votes, yet the Republican majority in the House of 
Representatives held strong. 
Can you guess why? Partisan redistricting. What we can 
hope for are districts that accurately represent a local popu-lation, providing the voters with a chance to elect someone who represents their community’s best interests in Wash-ington, instead of a political party or ideology.  Districts that veer too far to the left or right are a prime reason why our nation is in a holding pattern, but if we demand fair districts, 
perhaps we can elect those more interested in serving their 
constituents than interest groups, ideologically motivated organizations and lobbyists. Perhaps then, we, the people, will reign supreme. Who knows, maybe Congress will actu-ally accomplish something of signiﬁ  cance and earn a well-deserved vacation. For now, don’t hold your breath.

It’s been a tumultuous week for UF student Daniel Hel-
frich: First he bartered some Powerade in exchange for the Archer Chili’s giant chili statue, only to have it stolen from 
his neighbor’s balcony the night he took it home. His touch-ing story of love and loss caught the attention of corporate Chili’s, which doubled Helfrich’s original offered reward for ﬁ  nding the pepper (a $20 Chili’s gift card). Chili’s representa-tives then presented Helfrich with a new pepper at a gather-ing on Tuesday, so we’re giving him a you-made-our-week 
LAUREL to Helfrich, Chili’s and this classic story of lovers 
reunited. 
This week, Pasquale Rotella, the founder and CEO of the 
company that hosts EDC, Insomniac Entertainment threw some serious shade at Gainesville native and Platinum-sell-ing artist Tom Petty. The rocker recently made some dispar-aging comments about EDM, spinning the same critiques of the genre that many older folks make: DJing isn’t art, it’s stu-pid that people would pay to watch someone press “Play” on a laptop, etc. Rotella reacted, Spin reported, calling Petty a “classic rocker in search of contemporary social relevancy as he starts promoting new music,” among other subtle digs. The response itself was measured, as Spin put it, but it’s pretty au-dacious that a new guy would insult someone as established and respected as Petty. This is not to say that older artists don’t make mistakes or that EDM doesn’t have its creative faults, but in this case, we’re siding with Petty. 
Time will only tell if EDM becomes as inﬂ  uential and cul-
turally signiﬁ  cant as Tom Petty, but for now, we’re giving a sit-down-and-pay-your-dues DART to EDM industry man 
Pasquale Rotella. 
Now we have a shoutout to PolitiFact Florida, the bipar-
tisan fact-checking organization responsible for verifying all claims made by Florida politicians. As we noted this week, Rick Scott and Charlie Crist are on their way to becoming the least popular Florida gubernatorial candidates ever, and we’re eternally grateful for PolitiFact Florida’s tireless work in checking claims made by both factions. We’re giving a I-
want-to-shine-a-light-on-the-things-you-do LAUREL to PolitiFact Florida for doing great work. 
Finally, this last DART to bad-behavior fraternity Beta 
Theta Pi writes itself. Over the weekend. Beta’s toga party last weekend came to a halt when police answered a noise complaint and discovered underage drinkers at the party site. Bad behavior is nothing new for Beta; last year, they drew negative attention when one of its members was arrested in connection to an undercover online sex sting. The member solicited sex from what he thought was an underage girl and was subsequently booked on felony charges. In addition, Beta caught serious heat in 2012 when two white members were photographed in blackface makeup at a fraternity party, demonstrating a level of ignorance not often found on college campuses in today’s age. We know that, on the whole, Greek life is an enriching, time-honored experience, but incidences like these defend the negative stereotypes.

Roughly 100 students from the 
art and engineering departments 
at UF met Wednesday to partici-
pate in a ritualistic performance 
dedicating the newly installed art piece “Moving Water.”
Gathering on the Plaza of the 
Americas, nearly every partici-pant grasped a vessel filled with water. Each individual had col-lected the water from a location of personal significance.
Jesenia Lopez, a 21-year-old 
UF painting senior, had crafted her vessel from clay. Her water was from a duck pond she and 
her boyfriend spend time at near 
North Florida Regional Medical Center, she said.
Those gathered were split into 
four separate groups, each bearing 
the name one of the four cardinal 
directions. Each group portrayed a symbolic marker.
The north painted a blue stripe 
on the upper arm. The east car-ried leaves. The south painted blue waves under the eye. The west wore green bracelets made of yarn.
Each group gathered, encir-
cling Xavier Cortada of Miami, who was the guest artist for the Creative B term at UF and created the “Moving Water” project.
 Afterward each group 
“flowed” in the direction of its compass point, meeting at the al-ligator statue on the north side of the music building.
The performance was accom-
panied by music from the Cen-tury Tower carillon.
Leaving the statue, they walked 
to the north wall of the Computer 
Science and Engineering Building 
where the artwork hung.
One by one, those participating 
in the ceremony placed their ves-sels of water on shelves installed 
just below the piece, pledging to 
protect the waters of Florida.
Measuring 32 feet by four feet 
and constructed of 514 painted ce-
ramic tiles, “Moving Water” con-
veys images of the Panama Canal as well as artificial canals and other bodies of water in Florida, Cortada said.
The artwork intrinsically con-
nects the impact of the canal’s construction on the Panamanian landscape with the continuing al-
teration and manipulation of Flor-
ida’s waterways, Cortada said.
UF’s pending centennial cel-
ebration of the Panama Canal in-fluenced the work, Cortada said.
One of Cortada’s goals in 
working with students from the Department of Computer & In-formation Science & Engineering 
was for them to consider how 
their future actions as engineers can significantly impact the land and its ecosystem.
He said he would like the stu-
dents to “fall in love with the eco side” of the world in which they live and plan to shape.
“It is often the side we dis-
miss,” he added.
Lucinda Lavelli, dean of the  
College of the Arts, said the art-work “will bring such life into that sort of barren place that was also 
getting defaced with graffiti.”  
Funds for the “Moving Water” 
project came from money set aside by the Provost Office for Creative 
B, she said. No state dollars were used.
In total, $40,400 was spent on 
the “Moving Water” project.  
The artwork will remain in 
place for at least a year, Lavelli 
said. 
Permanent installation will be 
determined by the university’s lakes, vegetation and landscaping 
committee, she added.
“You always have an opinion 
with public art. Some people like it, some don’t, but very few are in-different,”  Lavelli said. 
“I don’t know that everybody 
will love this, but it is an educa-tional, aesthetic addition to the campus.”

Santa Fe College will host a 
contemporary Cuban art exhibit 
today with sensory-friendly ac-commodations.
The “Visions of Cuba” exhibi-
tion will open to the public today at 2 p.m. in the Fine Arts Hall at Santa Fe’s Northwest Campus.
For the exhibitions, the col-
lege is taking advantage of a new concept among art exhibits by of-fering a way for people with sen-sory processing disorders to exc-perience the show, said Kathryn Lehman, coordinator of cultural programs at Santa Fe.
The college will open a bal-
cony area and create a space for people to view the art from a dis-tance, away from large crowds.
“Our goal is to provide the arts 
for all of our citizens,” she said. “This gives a way for people with these disorders to see the art.”
During the exhibition, Raul 
Villarreal, an artist and art pro-
fessor at the College of Saint Eliz-
abeth in Morristown, New Jersey, will also give a public lecture, Le-hman said. 
The exhibition will be Villarre-
al’s third time speaking at Santa Fe. 
It is the first time it will offer 
sensory-friendly access, and he is excited about the inclusivity.
Villarreal said that learning 
about the use of sensory-friendly accommodations made him glad to be part of the show because he supports the idea to make art 
shows more accessible.
“One experience a lot of peo-
ple have when they are not famil-
iar with art shows is they become intimidated,” he said. “I believe trying to create a more welcome environment is a great endeavor.” 
Sam Supre-
nant, an 18-year-old UF English freshman, never thought about the impact art shows have on people with sensory processing disorders. 
Suprenant thinks it’s a good 
idea to offer greater accessibility to art events if possible.
“It’s an equal opportunity 
for everyone to experience the event,” she said. “It should defi-nitely be an option.”Although Suprenant supports 
Santa Fe’s accommodations for people with sensory processing disorders, she is curious about how incorporating similar quali-ties at other art-related events will affect the atmosphere.
“I wouldn’t want to hinder 
what other art shows already have going on,” she said.
The exhibition will feature 
about 47 pieces, including both artwork created by contemporary Cuban artists and photos taken during a recent cultural tour of Cuba, Lehman said. 
Most of the pieces are private-
ly owned by individuals who purchased them in Cuba.

Can a movie be smart yet exceed-
ingly dumb? Is it possible to look 
past empty dialogue, pointless action and shallow characters to recognize a ﬁ  lm’s deeper message? Have I just 
been mercilessly trolled? These are 
questions I kept asking myself after seeing Luc Besson’s “Lucy”. 
An American college student 
named Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is studying abroad in Taipei, Taiwan, when her boyfriend forces her to de-liver a suitcase to a Korean drug lord, who then abducts Lucy and forces her into becoming a drug mule.  She is subjected to sexual assault and mul-tiple beatings. The last beating forces the bag of drugs in her abdomen to rupture, spilling the substance into 
her bloodstream. The drug allows 
her to increase the percentage of her brain she can use, from 10 percent — the “human average,” according to the ﬁ  lm — to 100 percent.
Up to this point, the ﬁ  lm’s grasp on 
reality was tenuous at best but then just went insane. We get car chases, supernatural levita-tion, shootouts with seemingly endless shouting from Ko-rean gangsters and a mind-controlling heroine who literal-
ly dissolves at some 
point. With a lighter and more skilled 
directorial touch, “Lucy” might have owned this onslaught, but the ﬁ  lm rushes into being strange just for the sake of being strange.
It’s so fast-paced and action-heavy 
that any deeper meaning this ﬁ  lm might intend is lost. There are mes-sages Besson wants to get across, but he doesn’t have the patience or skills to send them well, which is a shame because the rich themes this ﬁ  lm could have explored are there.
Johansson actually might make 
this ﬁ  lm work. Her screen presence is just fascinating. She becomes an unknowable being with no particu-lar aim except to obtain more of the drug that she knows will kill her in 24 hours. One mannerism that she uses to great effect is tilting her head to the side before she strikes, like an animal slightly amused by its ter-riﬁ  ed prey. Johansson manages to seamlessly transition her character from a frightened, vulnerable victim to a dangerously inhuman beauty. Without ScarJo, I might have left the theater halfway due to the sheer ludi-
crousness. 
Whatever else, this movie is a sin-
gular theater experience. I am so frus-
trated  and confused by this ﬁ  lm that I will see it again just to gain some closure. It’s a movie that you will think about long after you probably should.
Lackluster ‘Lucy’ will blow your mind for all the wrong reasonsﬁ  lm

Gabrielle Ueberroth doesn’t need science to 
tell her how she feels about the color red.
“It has a negative connotation,” said Ueber-
roth, a 19-year-old UF psychology sophomore. 
“When I think of red, I think of ‘The Scarlet Let-
ter.’”
A group of researchers at the University of 
Rochester in New York set out to determine 
what women think of red, and their ﬁ  ndings suggest the ﬁ  ery hue rouses romantic rivalry. “I would ﬁ  nd a girl wearing red the most 
threatening, even if she isn’t the most attrac-
tive,” she said.
The study, published on July 11 in the Per-
sonality and Social Psychology Bulletin, used 
female subjects in three simple experiments.
In the ﬁ  rst, the participants were divided 
into two groups and shown a photo of a wom-an. One group saw the woman wearing white. The other saw her clad in red. Both were asked to rank, on a scale of one to 100, how sexually 
receptive the woman pictured was.
The second experiment used the same pho-
tos but tacked on a request: It asked participants 
to pretend they were competing for a man with the woman in the photo.The third experiment switched the alterna-
tive color from white to green. And this time, 
the test subjects were asked to rank how will-
ing they’d be to introduce their boyfriend to the woman in the photo and how comfortable they would be leaving him alone with her.
The threat was the lady in red. The woman 
pictured was consistently ranked as more sexu-al when wearing red versus white or green.
Researchers said these results suggest “some 
color signals are interpreted similarly across 
sex.” In layman’s terms? Both men and women 
ﬁ  nd red sexy. Researcher Adam Pazda cau-tioned, however, that the results were based on words, not actions, and may not apply to all women.Cultural differences and personal experi-
ence could also diminish the study’s real-world 
applicability,according to Aaron Victoria, head 
teaching assistant for a UF anthropology course on human sexuality and nature.
“Color plays a signiﬁ  cant role in the way 
we view people, make snap judgments about people, but I think there’s more to it than sim-ply biology,” Victoria said. “There might be cul-tures where colors and perception of colors are completely different.”
Brides wear red on their wedding day in Ra-
chel Penumudi’s native India. She said she as-sociates the color with marriage.
“I think it’s a really beautiful color, actually,” 
said the 19-year-old UF ﬁ  nance sophomore.Study: the color red rouses romantic rivalry among womenCODY SMITH

You may not have heard of new 
reggae pop outﬁ  t MAGIC! until this 
summer, but you’ve known lead singer Nasri Atweh’s catchy lyrics for years. 
As the lyricist in production duo 
The Messengers, Atweh has writ-ten hits ranging from Pitbull and Christina Aguilera’s “Feel This Mo-ment” to Justin Bieber’s “Never Say Never.”
Given Atweh’s penchant for 
penning modern-day sing-alongs, it makes sense that the greatest strength of MAGIC!’s debut album “Don’t Kill The Magic” would come from the infectious songwriting. 
Lead single “Rude” skyrocketed 
to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and for good reason: “Rude” tells a relatable story about rejection from a lover’s parent and a couple’s subsequent rebellion through mem-orable verses and a chorus that stays in the listener’s head for weeks.Don’t think MAGIC!’s pop sen-
sibilities compromise their reggae inspirations, though. 
Sure, the steel drums of “Let 
Your Hair Down” and off-beat gui-tar chords of “How Do You Want 
To Be Remembered” ﬁ  t the album’s 
pop aesthetic, but the group’s ap-proach to reggae fusion deftly re-
tains key characteristics of reggae 
while updating them for modern ears. 
Reggae purists will knock MAG-
IC!, but even they can’t deny the 
presence of the genre’s signature 
themes of love and longing.
Some weaker entries weigh the 
album down, most notably the un-ﬁ  tting faux-punk track “Little Girl 
Big World.” “Don’t Kill The Magic” 
never gets philosophical, but that 
clearly wasn’t MAGIC!’s intention. 
The group delivers in creating 
light pop tunes that never pander 
nor offend. Its debut LP won’t make 
the “Best Of” lists but will certainly 
dominate sales charts for many 
weeks to come.Reggae-pop band

From the bar area to the strip-
per poles, Uber Promotions is 
offering a party before the party with its new party bus.
The 40-passenger bus will have 
wrap-around seating, a sound sys-tem, one LED TV, a DVD player, two stripper poles (dancers not included), a drink area and more, said Mike Farzad, one of the co-owners of Uber Promotions.
The bus will be available to 
whomever can afford it. Farzad said he and his partner, Joey 
Friedman, expect UF alumni dur-
ing game days and for weddings. He also expects sororities and fra-ternities and those interested in downtown nightlife.
He said they expect clientele 
from ages 21 to 60 years old.
Rates start at $150 per hour, 
and unlike other party bus com-
panies, it will not require a mini-
mum number of riders. He said one-way transfers for a group of 40 would cost $6 a person, mak-ing them cheaper than some cab companies.
“We want to allow the option 
of a group of 20-30 people who are downtown to not have to each 
individually pay cabs,” he said. 
“We’re open to picking everybody up so they’re not forced to pay $500 or $600 for that hour.”
Farzad said that the stripper 
poles provide entertainment when the bus is stopped and help pas-sengers gain their balance when getting on and off the bus.
He said services will run main-
ly in Gainesville, but they will also offer day trips to cities fewer than two-and-a-half hours away, like Orlando or Jacksonville.
This means that if a party were 
to visit a theme park and pay for a day of service, the bus would stay in the park’s location.
Farzad said 
he wants to pro-mote safety with the new bus and hopes to be able to curb drunk driving. They decided to buy 
the bus to fulﬁ  ll a need of their customers and the community, he 
said.
He said compared to other ser-
vices such as SNAP, UF’s Student 
Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol, and cabs, the party bus will allow big-ger groups to get around without having to take multiple trips.
Farzad said the bus is licensed 
and insured, and the company has 
several experienced drivers.
The outside of the bus is black 
with the Uber Promotions logo 
and contact information, he said.Alyssa Allen, a 21-year-old UF 
senior ﬁ  nance major and the social chair of UF’s Delta Delta Delta so-rority, said she could see her orga-nization using the party bus for its functions if prices ﬁ  t the budget.
“Party buses are notorious for 
fun adventures and would be a great start to any night,” she said.
She said she likes the idea be-
cause it gets rid of the designated driver and no one has to worry about how they’re getting to and from their destination.
Allen said that the wraparound 
seating on the party bus will also 
make the idea more appealing 
because on the buses they usually take to functions, there are 2 rows on either side that don’t allow for a group atmosphere.
She added the fact that pledge 
rides, where fraternity pledges have to be designated drivers for social events, have been prohib-
ited by the school. She said with 
this rule in place, she thinks party buses will become much more popular.
Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias,   Gainesville 
Police Public Information Ofﬁ  cer, said, “Anything that would pre-vent people from drinking and driving would be a good thing.”
Service on the bus began on 
July 19, and groups can reserve rides by calling Uber Promotions at 352-256-3338.

Cookbooks contain more than directions for 
food preparation. They are like a “magician’s 
hat: one can get more out of them than they seem to contain,” or so muses culinary historian 
Barbara Wheaton. 
Read closely as cultural artifacts, cookbooks 
are rewarding, surprising and illuminating. 
Indeed, cookbooks are historic documents and supply information about the available ingredi-
ents, food fashions and household technology 
of the time. They reveal much about the societ-
ies that produce them. 
Authors often provide additional tips on 
how to better one’s life, such as how to shop, 
manage time effectively, entertain guests, travel 
or protect the environment. Thus, cookbooks 
offer recipes for living, providing glimpses of what life was like for our predecessors.
To understand cookbooks as written records, 
let’s trace the history of American cookbooks. 
The tradition of American cooking began with 
the Colonial times, when recipes were passed down orally and recorded in handwritten col-lections of “receipts,” meaning “received rules 
of cookery.”
Often, the recipes were obscure or missing 
information, assuming a breadth of culinary 
knowledge of the reader was gained from hands-on experience in the kitchen. Equipment 
was rustic, with people cooking on a hearth 
with earthenware pots.
When the iron range came into use in the 
1850s, previous cookbooks became obsolete 
because their methods did not work with the new technology. Additional advances such as the oven, smokehouse, air drying, solar cook-ing and ice house, expanded the repertoire of recipes. Copper and cast iron pots and pans al-
lowed for much higher temperature of cooking 
than earthenware or ceramics.
The few printed cookbooks 
in America were European imports from the immigrant 
settlers in the mid-1700s. It 
was not until 1796 that a cook-book by an American author, 
“American Cookery” by Ame-
lia Simmons, was published. 
Cookbooks provide insight to the foods 
available in the list of ingredients, including 
pineapple and coconut appearing in recipes by 
the end of the 1850s. One learns also about how 
food was obtained. For instance, in the 1850s, 
urban cookbooks featured a wider variety of 
ingredients bought from the street markets and vendors, measuring food quantities by price — 
“a punnet of strawberries” — rather than by 
amount. 
Rural cookbooks depended on the kitchen 
garden and self-procured goods and discussed what to plant, ﬁ  sh and hunt. So, to draw a 
broader implication, the repertoire of ingredi-
ents displays the economic and geographic pat-
terns of the region.
Nowadays, the old apprenticeship system is 
replaced with cooking channels like the Food 
Network, video clips from YouTube, or recipes 
from cookbooks and magazines (print and digi-
tal). Cooking tools today are sophisticated and 
affordable, enabling the reader to cook from a vast repertoire of recipes. 
As a result, cookbooks include recipes reﬂ  ect-
ing the technological advances, such as creamy 
cauliﬂ  ower soup (blender), grilled chicken (bar-
becue grill or oven) or toaster wafﬂ  es (toaster, freezer) and can assume the reader has the nec-essary equipment.Reading cookbooks as historyfood

It was 6 a.m. in the Butler Plaza 
Publix bakery when a co-worker said 
something I never thought I’d hear: “I’m glad ‘Weird Al’ Yankovic is do-ing well again.”
My head snapped.I went home after my shift to ﬁ  nd, 
in fact, “Weird Al” had been making new music. And not just a single, a whole album.
The 54-year-old Yankovic released 
his 14th album, “Mandatory Fun,” full of parodies and comedic inter-pretations, and just like the ﬁ  rst one 
released in 1983, it has simple, funny 
reworks of some of the era’s most popular and annoying sounds while paying homage to artists who he en-joys.
On “Mandatory Fun,” Yankovic 
parodies the sexist and degrading “Blurred Lines” by Robin Thicke and changes it into a tune pointing out 
poor grammar, noting he thinks it’s a 
“Goooooood tiiiiiiime / to learn some grammar / Now did I stammer? / Go learn some grammar.”
Additionally, he parodies the 
Grammy Award-winning “Roy-als” by Lorde (“Foil”), the still-infectiously annoying “Happy” by Pharrell (“Tacky”), the “damn, 
how-did-this-song-get-radio-play-in-
the-ﬁ  rst-place” summer hit “Fancy” by Iggy Azalea (“Handy”) and the not-so-bad “Radioactive” by Imag-ine Dragons (“Inactive”), along with a mash-up of songs including Miley Cyrus’ “Wrecking Ball,” Foster the People’s “Pumped Up Kicks,” Psy’s “Gangnam Style,” Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Call Me Maybe” and more in a genre he knows best: polka.
The comedian also makes original 
songs inﬂ  uenced by music he had been listening to recently, like Foo 
Fighters (“My Own Eyes”), Blue Oyster Cult (“Lame Claim to Fame”) and, maybe my favorite, the wonderful out-of-date tradition of college ﬁ  ght songs 
(“Sports Songs”).
While “Mandatory Fun” isn’t any-
thing I’d play on my way to the beach while I’m trying to enjoy my last days of summer in Gainesville or at the damn-it-it’s-the-end-of-the-summer party I hope to remember, it is a re-minder of how annoying all of these sounds can get from radio and club play and how easy it is to make fun of 
them. It helps that “Weird Al”’s takes 
on these songs are actually funny and tolerable after hearing the beat to some of them too often over the last year.
“Weird Al” would never come up 
in anyone’s “Best Artists of All Time” lists probably ever (aside from my co-worker’s, maybe), but I ﬁ  nally realize 
the appreciation we all should have 
for him. 
He can make music until the day 
he dies, and I’ll still listen — espe-cially if he’s joking about Iggy Azalea and Robin “I Want Paula Back, But I’ll Exploit My Fame To Make Money Off Her” Thicke. ‘Weird Al’ still workingBUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

UF still has a bone to pick 
with UConn.
Two of the Gators’ three 
losses last season came at the 
hands of the Huskies — the ﬁ  rst on a last-second Sha-bazz Napier buzzer beater 
in Storrs, Conn., on Dec. 2; 
the other a 10-point loss in their Final Four matchup to oust Florida from the NCAA Tournament in Arlington, 
Texas.
Separating those two loss-
es was a 30-game win streak 
— the longest in program 
history — and a perfect run 
against Southeastern Confer-ence foes.
Florida announced its 
non-conference schedule for the 2014-15 season on 
Wednesday, and capping off 
the 13-game lineup is a Jan. 3 contest against Connecticut in the O’Connell Center.
The rest of the schedule 
leading up to the UF-UConn rematch won’t be smooth sailing, though. 
Of the seven teams meet-
ing the Gators in Paradise Is-land, Bahamas, for the Battle 4 Atlantis, ﬁ  ve of them quali-ﬁ  ed for the NCAA Tourna-ment last season.
“This difﬁ  cult schedule 
will not only prepare our team for league and postsea-son play, it delivers a terriﬁ  c lineup of marquee games 
for our fans,” Mike Hill, 
Florida’s executive associate athletics director for external affairs, said in a release.
After an exhibition game 
against Barry University on Nov. 6, Billy Donovan and Co. start the regular season 
with a three-game home-
stand against William & Mary (Nov. 14), Miami (Fla.) (Nov. 17) and Louisiana-Monroe (Nov. 21).

the Hurricanes is the start MORGAN MORIARTY

AlligatorSports continues its 2014 
Florida football position breakdown by 
turning its attention to the quarterback position.
Florida is just one of just ﬁ  ve 
teams in the Southeastern Confer-ence that has a veteran quarterback returning in redshirt junior Jeff Driskel.
Driskel is due for a true breakout season in offensive coordinator Kurt Roper’s spread scheme. Although this is the quarterback’s third offen-sive coordinator since he’s arrived in Gainesville, this is the one which suits him best.
For starters, he won’t play under 
center but instead from the shotgun, which is what he excelled in during 
high school — a career that featured 
more than 4,800 yards in the air and 1,567 on the ground. Driskel will be, as Will Mus-
champ put it at SEC Media Days earlier this month, “what he was recruited to Florida to be.”
His biggest plays will be made 
with his feet. Throughout the spring, Driskel looked more conﬁ  dent and comfortable from the gun when he took off and ran. The system won’t 
have many designed quarterback 
runs per se, but when Driskel has to

Florida gets its quarterback back
JOHNSON’S JOURNAL
A few months ago, one of my room-
mates brought home a blowgun. Like any red-blooded American 
male, we immediately went outside to try and shoot stuff. One of those things was a 
squirrel in our backyard. My roommate hit 
one, but I am not the marksman he is and didn’t come close. I tell you that story to say: I know what it means to be 18 years old and just mess around like Heisman winner Jameis Winston.
On Wednesday, the USA Today posted 
a story citing a November 2012 incident in-volving the Florida State quarterback and 
a pellet gun, but you wouldn’t know it by 
the headline that reads, “Jameis Winston stopped by police at gunpoint in 2012 incident.”
That grabs your attention. 
That gets you reading and — more importantly — sharing on 
Facebook and Twitter, which 
is the real point of a headline such as that one. Then I scrolled down to read what Winston as well as teammate Chris Casher did, and I felt like I had wasted my time. 
Winston and Casher were out one night 
with a pellet gun on a trail near campus. They told a campus police ofﬁ  cer they were 
hunting squirels after the ofﬁ  cer drew his 
weapon and forced the two to get on the ground because he believed the pair had a ﬁ  rearm with them. 
When the kerfufﬂ  e was over, 
the two were given back the gun and the pellets that went with 
it, and later that night were in-
volved in a previously reported incident involving a pellet gun shoot out later that same night at an apartment complex.
Now, the USA Today is far from being 
above clickbait — they have an entire web-site devoted to such things called Forthewin.com. The content of the story itself is not 
that, but thanks to that headline, that is what 
this story became.This is not to disparage Rachel Axon’s re-
porting or to say that what she reported is not news. Axon dug and found something noteworthy — and also kind of funny — about the most high-proﬁ  le athlete in college 
football. That’s her job. It is also news in the 
barren wasteland of July. 
But the headline — that she probably 
didn’t write — attached to the story ruins the work under it. The ensuing piece didn’t live up to the headline’s billing and is more sordid than it should be.
This is where we are with Jameis Win-
ston.

“Tickets for free tweet lessons?#???????” 
Will Muschamp 
UF head coach after direct messages to recruits were sent as regular tweetstake off and run up field, he’ll 
be able to gain positive yardage more easily from the shotgun.
That’s not to say Driskel 
won’t be throwing the ball this 
season. Last season, Duke’s of-
fense under Roper — with help from quarterbacks Brandon Cornette and Anthony Boone — averaged 248 yards in the air per game. 
Florida’s offense averaged 
171 yards per game, which ranked 107th in the country.
Driskel has the talent and 
arm strength to make diffi-cult throws. And being in the shotgun will make it easier for Driskel to keep his eyes down-field when he’s flushed out of the pocket. The veteran quar-terback also welcomes a new  consistent playmaker in trans-
fer tight end Jake McGee to an already loaded wide receiving corps — not to mention a vet-
eran offensive line. Driskel has all the tools to flourish in 2014.
Driskel’s backup isn’t set in 
stone yet, but the two options include early enrollee Will Gri-er and incoming freshman Tre-on Harris. Both will battle it out in fall camp, but Harris might 
win the job because of his rush-
ing ability. If Driskel suffers an-other injury like he did in 2013, Harris could be incorporated in quarterback run packages to avoid costly freshman mistakes passing the ball.
Skyler Mornhinweg didn’t 
perform well in his two starts 
last season when Tyler Mur-
phy was hurt, but any starting experience is good experience. Grier would be wise to red-shirt and gain some weight in 2014, but whoever performs best throughout fall camp will earn the backup role behind Driskel. 16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 31, 2014
Florida to face UConn 
in rematch of Final Four
of a home-and-home series the 
teams agreed to on July 1 and will be the first time the teams 
face each other since the 2009 
NIT. UF owns the all-time series record 45-22.
From there, Florida will travel 
to Paradise Island, Bahamas, for the fourth-annual Battle 4 Atlan-tis. 
Each of the eight teams in the 
field — North Carolina, George-
town, UCLA, Wisconsin, Ala-
bama-Birmingham, Oklahoma, Butler and Florida — will play three games during the tourna-ment set to begin on Nov. 26. The draw for the tournament is ex-pected to be released in August.
After returning to the United 
States, UF will travel to Law-rence, Kan., to face Kansas in the SEC/Big 12 challenge on Dec. 5.
The rest of Florida’s schedule 
consists of home matches against Yale (Dec. 8), Texas Southern (Dec. 12) and Jacksonville (Dec. 14); a game against Wake Forest 
on Dec. 20 in the Orange Bowl 
Classic at Sunrise, Fla.; and a trip to Tallahassee for its annual con-test against Florida State on Dec. 
30 before facing Connecticut at 
home to lead into the SEC slate.hoops , from page 15
Winston used pellet gun with team-
mate close to FSU’s campus in 2012
Part of it is his own doing. Of 
course if he didn’t get into the BB 
gun “battle” at the apartment com-plex, or shoplift crablegs, or put soda in a Burger King water cup or 
obviously if he was not previously 
wrapped up in allegations of rape, this would not be news. 
But because of that, it is. This story exists in its current 
form thanks to our 24-hour news cycle. Jameis Winston — like John-ny Manziel before him — lives in a chicken-or-the-egg dichotomy that 
is sports media in 2014.
Is it Winston’s fault for doing — 
as far as this incident is concerned 
— what young guys often do? Is it the media’s fault for reporting anytime an athlete so much as farts downwind? Or is it the fault of the fanbase with an appetite that is insatiable for news about those 
it idolizes.
The truth is, of course, vari-ous bits of all three. In the 1920s, 
sportswriters hid Babe Ruth’s ex-tra-marital affairs, but the media in this day and age is not a vehicle to deify America’s sporting he-roes. The media has an obligation to turn up stones to find what is 
there about public figures, which 
Winston certainly is. 
The manner in which the story 
was presented makes it seem more egregious than what really hap-pened and does a disservice to Winston.
Insult to injury was added when 
the USA Today had to issue an edi-
tor’s note that admits to a fact er-
ror. The incident did not actually happen on FSU’s campus like the original story stated. 
Instead, it occurred across the 
street from it. That would then make the incident not a formal violation of the part of the school’s conduct policy that says having a 
gun on campus is prohibited. 
The paragraph detailing the 
code of conduct aspect was re-moved by USA Today, and the 
editor’s note admitting the gaffe was placed in italics at the top of the story.
Thanks to the viral nature of the 
headline and the athlete promi-nently featured, the story got legs 
and migrated to all sorts of aggre-
gating blogs — even one for a na-tional outlet like Fox Sports. 
Fox, in its regurgitation of the 
story — which has also been ed-ited since the original posting  — seized upon the initially reported facts that the incident happened on campus and that it was a violation 
of the code of conduct in its para-
phrasing of the story. That made Fox, for a time, a national platform that disseminated incorrect infor-mation about a high-profile athlete on its high-profile website. And so the cycle snowballs on and on.
Jameis Winston found him-
self squarely in that media cycle’s 
crosshairs Wednesday. He knows 
once more how those squirrels felt in 2012.
