Alachua County residents got a taste of local food with 
the start of the county’s ﬁ  rst Local Food Week this weekend.
The celebration, organized by the Alachua County Ofﬁ  ce 
of Sustainability, started this Saturday with the 441 Farmers’ 
Market, 5920 NW 13th St., and an open house and barbecue 
at the Porters Community Farm, 518 SW Third St.
Local Food Week will continue until Sunday.Andi Houston, the assistant manager at 441 Farmers’ 
Market, said that there has been a huge push to promote the 
event, especially because it was the ﬁ  rst 
event of the week.
“We hope that Alachua County resi-
dents see what is available to purchase,” she said. “We also want them to see what 
restaurants are using local products and to go there.
Eric Bjerregaard, a local grower who 
has been selling his stock of produce at the 
441 Farmers’ Market for the past 18 years, said customers spending money at the farmers market sends a message.
“The message is ‘Please don’t sell your land,’” he said. 
“We want to eat locally.”
Stefanie Hamblen, founder of Hogtown HomeGrown, 
a monthly newsletter and website about local food, gave a 
cooking demonstration at Saturday’s event.
She said she wants to educate residents about purchasing 
local food and how to cook it.
“I would often watch people pick things up and put them 
down because they didn’t know what to do with them,” she 
said.
She said that purchasing food from the farmers market is Alachua County learns to eat, grow local foods

Like thousands of other high school 
seniors, Charles Kennedy logged into 
the UF admissions page Friday to see if he would be a future Gator.
But he didn’t see a “congratulations.” 
He didn’t see anything at all.
“I didn’t get through till almost an 
hour and 45 minutes later,” said the 17-year-old high school senior. “Just sit-ting there and anticipating deﬁ  nitely got me pretty anxious.”
Kennedy’s family decided to go out 
to dinner to keep busy. On his phone in the car, the page ﬁ  nally loaded. He got 
in. 
“My mom went crazy,” he said.
UF had 28,834 applicants, said UF 
spokesman Steve Orlando.Orlando said the standards for pro-
spective students have stayed the same, but the university has seen the number of applicants rise.
UF accepted 12,370 for Summer B 
and Fall 2013 semesters. Orlando said the enrollment goal is 6,400.
UF’s Innovation Academy admitted 
2,114 students. Students enrolled in the program take classes during the Sum-mer and Spring semesters and have the Fall semester off.
About 1,100 of the 2,114 students who 
were admitted to the program were giv-en the option to start in the Fall or Sum-mer term, Orlando said. The remaining applicants were only offered admission 
to the Innovation Academy.
The enrollment goal for the Innova-
tion Academy is 500. The average SAT 
score was 1967 and the average ACT score was 30.

The Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce is in-
vestigating the deaths of a Gainesville couple 
after a maintenance worker discovered their bodies Thursday afternoon.
Steven R. England, 46, and Mary E. Dun-
nigan, 44, were found dead in their apartment at the Tower Oaks Glen apartment complex, 6900 SW 21st Lane, said ASO spokesman Art Forgey.
Investigators conducted an autopsy of the 
bodies Friday morning, but Forgey said the re-sults won’t be available for a few weeks.
Deputies aren’t looking for a suspect, Forgey 
said. He didn’t comment further on what au-thorities believe happened.
However, based on the nature of England 
and Dunnigan’s relationship, apartment em-ployees and neighbors said they know what happened in Building O, Apartment four.  
Luis Lugo, a painter at the apartment com-
plex, was the ﬁ  rst to discover the bodies.
While walking past England and Dunni-
gan’s apartment Thursday , he glanced through the window and saw Dunnigan lying on the ﬂ  oor and England lying on the bed with a shot-
gun between his legs.
“There was blood everywhere,” he said.
Lugo thinks it was a murder suicide: Eng-
land shot Dunnigan and then turned the gun on himself.
Karen Baird, the apartment’s property man-
ager, said England moved into the complex about six months ago. She said she worked with him after he was hired as an apartment 
maintenance worker a month and a half ago.
Baird described England as a polite and 
humble man, like a “southern gentleman.”
However, Baird said that after Dunnigan 
moved in with him, the couple developed 
problems.
They fought often, mostly while drunk, 
Baird said. Dunnigan would take off in his car for days and come back, sometimes with it Couple found dead in apartment

Feb. 11, 1965: The first “price ad” by a local supermarket ran 
in The Alligator. George’s Meat-A-Rama, which was on Main Street downtown, placed the ad. The store’s advertising man-ager, Gary Burke, said it was the first Gainesville business to target an ad toward price-conscious students. 
Feb. 14, 1974: Eleanor Chriswell, a UF educational psychology 
alumna, completed a survey on the social image of pipe smok-ers. She studied human behavior and stimuli that cause chang-es in brain waves of smokers and nonsmokers. “Pipe smokers are viewed by women as special men; sexy and superior in every way ,” Chriswell said. 
Feb. 10, 1982: Administration and Student Government of-
ficials stalled plans to combine library cards, fee cards, infir -
mary cards and all other UF 
student cards into an all-in-one identification card. Print-ing the cards would have cost $15,000 for the equipment and an additional $50,000 to issue them to all UF students. There was no room in the 
budget.

UF’s new GatorLink login page should be easier 
for students to use. It is scheduled to go live at 6 a.m. 
March 3.
A GatorLink, more formally known as authentica-
tion, is an individual’s computer identity at UF, accord-
ing to the UF Computing Help Desk. Every applicant, 
student, faculty and staff member is required to have a GatorLink account with a username and password.
“Students may not realize that there are more than 
500 services on campus that require a GatorLink log-in,” said Tracy Gale, communications manager for UF Information Technology. “All of these services require that you are who you say you are.”With the new login page, GatorLink services can uti-
lize the same screen appearance and features whether people are logging on the Registrar’s office, Sakai or ac-cessing software in a lab, Gale said.
The new login page will be easily accessible on 
smartphones, tablets and desktops because the coding is friendly to all types of devices and platforms, Gale 
said.
The main goal of this change is to make accessing 
UF’s service easier for students.
Bethany Curl, a 21-year-old UF journalism junior, 
said she hopes the new login page doesn’t leave her 
frustrated like the old one tends to do.
“The current login page is really difficult to access 
from my phone, so I’m interested in seeing how the 
new one works,” she said.Standardized GatorLink login coming
� VALENTINE’S WEEK SEES 
HIGHER ADOPTION RATES.
ALEX HARRIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Alachua County Animal 
Services wanted its furry friends 
to find love in time for Valentine’s Day.
Residents gathered at the shel-
ter’s headquarters to look among 40 cats and dogs for a new friend dur -
ing the “Valentine Tails” adoption event Saturday afternoon.
Hilary Hynes, public education 
program coordinator for Alachua County Animal Services, said the shelter often sees a higher rate of pet adoptions the week leading up to Valentine’s Day.
“We always like to offer an op-
portunity around Valentine’s Day,” she said. “This is unconditional love for all the right reasons.”
The event featured a bake sale, 
food raffles and a silent auction, with all the proceeds going to the shelter.
One happy new pair was Charles “Charlie” Williams and his one-year-old cat, Ace. Williams said he was happy with his new friend and called Ace a good fit for his house-hold.
“I haven’t had animals in years, 
but I like him,” he said.
When Williams filled out the fi-
nal adoption paperwork and was 
ready to leave the shelter, volun-
teers rang a cowbell and cheered for Ace and his new owner.
Hynes said she loves when peo-
ple visit the shelter. Her ultimate goal, she said, is always adoption.
“Falling in love is awesome be-
cause it’s for a lifetime,” she said. “You can tell them anything. They’re 
going to keep your secrets.”Valentine’s pet adoptions spread love
“This is unconditional 
love for all the right 
reasons.”

for Alachua County Animal Servicesdamaged.
“She always pushed his buttons,” 
she said, “but he always took her 
back.”
Landon McBride, England’s next 
door neighbor, said he was friends with England.
In the mornings, England would 
make coffee, smoke a cigarette and watch the news. McBride would come over and watch TV with him.
Sometimes they’d talk about Eng-
land’s father, who died a few months ago, or about England’s relationship.
“He was a kind man,” McBride 
said. “He was just going through a lot in his life, and I always told him every-thing would be all right.”
The Monday before Lugo discov-
ered the bodies, England confided in McBride that Dunnigan got her tax re-turn back and was talking about leav-ing to stay with her mother.
Then McBride didn’t see him for two days.
“Everyone was asking where he 
was,” he said. “Then they found him dead. It just crushed me. I didn’t think he would do it like that.”
At the complex Saturday afternoon, 
a cleaning company truck sat parked outside the apartment.
Two men opened a trailer hitched 
to the truck, pulled out bleach and sponges and carried them into the 
apartment. The porch light was still on 
in the daylight.
“I hear he blew her brains out,” 
a boy said, part of a pack of children lined up outside the trailer watching the cleaning men.
McBride said he is still in shock 
about his friend’s death.
“It was senseless,” he said.
Despite all of the fighting, Baird be-
lieves England had a reason.
“[Dunnigan] said she was going to 
leave,” Baird said. “I guess he stopped 
her from leaving.”

On Jan. 30, UF activated 
its connection to the Internet2 
Innovation Platform, a re-search-based initiative which transfers data at 100 Gigabits-
per-second, or 10 times the 
previous network’s operating speed.
To put it into perspective, 
transferring a normal student’s hard drive across the network would take moments. Howev-er, students won’t use the sys-tem. It will be used to transfer 
large amounts of research data 
through fiber-optic cables to Jacksonville and three other Internet2 test centers.
The project, according to a news release, cost $2.4 mil-lion between National Science 
Foundation grants and institu-
tional funding.
Erik Deumens, the director 
of research computing, said the $2.4 million paid for the connection cables, upgrades to campus data centers and a network junction box half the size of a refrigerator.
He said UF requested to 
be part of the program in its drive to become a top 10 pub-lic university, and that having such an advanced network will likely make UF attractive to researchers and prospective students.
Associate electrical and 
computer engineering profes-sor Andy Li said that after 40 years of the old Internet, the Internet2 is a turning point of fundamental change.UF joins Internet2

More than 900 people huddled 
around telescopes to gaze at Ju-
piter, Orion’s Belt and countless 
other celestial bodies in Saturday 
night’s dark sky.
The Alachua Astronomy Club, 
Inc., held a Star Party at Hickory 
Ranch on the east side of Paynes 
Prairie Preserve State Park.
Members of the club set up 
telescopes and provided com-mentary on the cosmos to star -
gazers.
Star Parties offer beginners 
a chance to become acquainted with the sky and learn about tele-scopes before purchasing their 
own, according to the Alachua 
Astronomy Club website.
The event featured hayrides 
and a roaring bonfire, complete with s’mores and hot chocolate.  
Steven Whitaker, who has 
been an astronomy club mem-ber for about three months, used a new telescope he received for Christmas to show Orion’s Belt to spectators.
“I’ve been looking at stars 
since I was a little kid,” Whitaker 
said.
While many club members 
live in Gainesville, the Alachua Astronomy Club attracts mem-
bers from outside of the county who drive in for meetings and 
events.Tandy Carter, of Lake City, 
has been a member for 14 years. 
Carter pointed out the nebula surrounding Orion’s Belt while giving bystanders a lesson about 
Jupiter and its moons.
“I love telling the story of 
how Galileo discovered the four 
moons and how that changed not 
only how we look at the universe 
but our position in the universe,” he said.
Carter uses a Meade LX200-
ACF Schmidt-Cassegrain. The telescope has a feature that al-lows its user to zero in on a spe-
cific star or planet and then fol-
low it as it slowly cruises across the sky.
Aubrey Primer, a 20-year-old 
UF public relations junior, said 
she enjoyed her first Star Party.
“Seeing Jupiter and the nebula 
around Orion’s Belt was really 
cool,” she said. “I had no idea 
you could see this many stars in 
Gainesville.” Residents gather at Paynes Prairie to gaze at the stars

Houston said that by 11 
a.m., more than half of the 441 
Farmers’ Market was sold out.
“It’s tough to get people out 
here on a Saturday, but we’ve sold out because of Local Food 
Week,” she said.”
Meanwhile, about 60 peo-
ple attended Porters Commu-
nity Farm’s open house and 
barbecue to showcase Gaines-
ville’s first urban farm, which 
opened last fall.
The farm includes ten 55-
foot rows used to grow pro-
duce for St. Francis House for 
the Homeless, according to 
the Florida Organic Growers’ 
website.
“We bring the food to the 
St. Francis House by bicycle. We have trailers that attach to 
our bikes and the charities are right around the corner,” said 
Travis Mitchell, community 
food project coordinator for 
FOG and a UF alumna.
Mitchell said his goal for 
the first year is to harvest one ton of produce for charity and 
beautify the farm.
“I want to clean it up and 
make it presentable, so it can 
be a catalyst for other projects,” 
he said.
Mitchell is the only staff 
member on the farm, but he’s not running it alone. 
He has four interns and 
a handful of volunteers who 
help him.Lauren Walls, an intern at 
FOG, said Saturday’s event 
was to raise awareness about 
the farm.
“It’s tucked away, and a lot 
of people still have no idea that 
it exists.”
Local Food Week will con-
tinue today with an hour-long gardening class hosted by the 
UF’s Institute of Food and Ag-
ricultural Sciences extension at 
the County Extension Office, 
2800 NE 39th Ave.
It will also continue with 
other events such as a screening of the documentary “GROW!” 
at Jolie Restaurant, 12 W. Uni-
versity Ave. and the Union 
Street Farmers’ Market on Bo 
Diddley Community Plaza.

UF&Shands Health System, said that on certain weekends, when everything is sold out, he gets calls from family members of patients looking for some-
where to stay.
“Many of our patients 
travel for significant distances 
— more than a daytime trip,” Guzick said. 
The $30 million project is ex-
pected to be completed by late 2014 or early 2015. The project is still awaiting city approval.
Bradley Pollitt, Shands vice 
president of facilities, said the guesthouse would have about 150 rooms.
“We have people who end 
up sleeping in the lobby some-
times, which is not good for 
them,” he said.
If the patient is in Shands 
for four or five days, the fam-ily will need somewhere to stay and will be able to stay in the guesthouse, Guzick said. 
“If you can imagine your 
loved one in the hospital stay-
ing overnight, and you’re wor -
ried about them, it’s very diffi-
cult to be four miles down the road in a hotel,” Pollitt said.Shands to build house

Early-risers. Athletes. Ambitious 
students in running shoes.
The chill of an 8 a.m. Sunday 
did not deter them from gathering 
together in the streets.
The Friends for Life of America 
annual Mile for a Child 5K raised 
about $650 to donate to the Make-
A-Wish Foundation and Camp 
Boggy Creek.
About 30 people ran in the 5K, which began on Gale Lemerand Drive and followed UF’s 
Southwest Recreation Center 5K route.
“It’s really exciting, how much 
money we’ve raised,” said Meray 
Ohanessian, Friends for Life 
president. “It’s not a huge 5K, but every penny counts.”
The race is one of four annual 
events that the club organizes to 
raise awareness and funds for 
pediatric cancer research, said Malorie Lipman, the club’s vice president.
The members of Friends for 
Life vote for two organizations to raise money for each year, and 
this year they chose the Make-
A-Wish Foundation and Camp 
Boggy Creek. 
Both organizations serve 
children and families of children with life-threatening illnesses.
The first collegiate chapter of 
Friends for Life of America began 
at UF in 2000, Lipman said. 
Since then, the organization has spread to schools across the 
country.
The club has about 30 
members.
Because of its size, it’s easy for 
people who are passionate about 
the cause to get involved, Lipman said.Sebastian Vargas, a 20-year-old 
UF chemical engineering junior, saw the advertisements for the race at the gym.
Although he mainly runs for 
his health, Vargas knows a close 
relative who survived cancer as 
a child.
“Everyone runs for a reason. If 
you want to run to get healthier, that’s good,” Vargas said. “Or if 
you just want to support a cause, 
that’s fantastic.”Students gather, race at 5K for pediatric cancer research
� THE HOLY TRINITY EPISCOPAL CHURCH 
PURCHASED THE BUILDING IN DECEMBER.

After 14 months of selling used clothing, books and furni-
ture, a downtown Gainesville vintage and resale store closed 
its doors Saturday afternoon.
Loren Keldsen, co-owner of The Eclectic Co. Vintage & Re-
sale Shop, said time and money were the motivating factors 
behind the store closing. Keldsen owned the store, 103 N. Main 
Street, with his wife, Anna Keldsen.
He said keeping the shop open and finding new items to sell became time-consuming for him after his wife started working a full-time job at Nationwide Insurance.
This fall was slow for business, and the holidays were even 
worse, he said.
“We can’t afford to put more money into the shop,” he said. 
“It has to pay for itself.”
Kelsen said Holy Trinity Episcopal Church purchased the 
building in December, and the church plans to use the old building for its youth service program.In the meantime, he’ll either keep leftover store items or 
donate them to Haven Hospice. He will donate old books to Friends of the Library.
Keldsen said he plans to move to New Jersey to assist the 
Hurricane Sandy disaster relief and work with a Federal Emer -
gency Management Agency contractor in the organization’s public assistance program.
Keldsen said local artists usually gathered at the store to 
share their creations and make extra money . They will now have to start selling their pieces elsewhere.
Pat McCarthy helped run the store in exchange for space to 
sell homemade food items, photography and jewelry with her husband. She said she’s disappointed the shop closed.
“It was one of those bad things that just didn’t catch on fast 
enough,” she said.Vintage store closes, owner to help with Hurricane Sandy relief

About 720 people became certified in per -
forming CPR and using automated external 
defibrillators at the second annual GatorSav-ers event Saturday.
Jon Duff, an owner of Florida Heartsaver 
Center for CPR and Safety Training, said the event also taught people how to relieve chok-ing and what the signs and symptoms of a heart attack are.
“The whole idea is that this is for people 
who wouldn’t normally take a CPR class,” Duff said.
People could become CPR and AED-certi-
fied by watching a video from the American Heart Association. They performed CPR on mannequins, and instructors helped attendees use proper techniques.“I think the video is a fun way to gain 
knowledge about CPR certification,” said Jes-sie Cohen, president of Gators Bleed Orange and Blue and a 21-year-old UF English and advertising senior.
At the end of each session, participants re-
ceived printed certificates from the American Heart Association.
People who attended the event could also 
sign up for bone marrow, organ and tissue registries. LifeSouth Community Blood Cen-ters hosted a blood drive.
Maggie Tucker, an American Heart Asso-
ciation CPR instructor, said Saturday’s event was a collaboration of Florida Heartsaver, LifeSouth and Gators Bleed Orange and Blue. Forty-four American Heart Association in-structors attended.
“Everyone showed up,” Tucker said. “It all 
came together. That’s the exciting part.”
She said 508 people attended the event last 
year. Next year, the organizations are hoping 
for 1,000 people.
Chris Roberts, an 18-year-old UF informa-
tion systems freshman, said a person never 
knows when he or she will need to save a life.
“It’s good to know in case someone needs 
CPR,” Roberts said. Emergency training draws about 720 to GatorSavers event“It’s not a huge 5K, but

accepted into UF?
141 TOTAL VOTES55% YES
45% NOFriday’s question: Have you ever deactivated your Facebook? Stephen Col-bear: 
The politician 
America deserves
There’s just something about events that are closed to the 
media that intrigue us.
Why aren’t we allowed in? What are we missing out 
on? Last week, the House Democrats hosted its annual retreat. Awesome people like President Barack Obama and Bill Clinton 
gave inspirational speeches. So did Stephen Colbert.
He gave a speech and was interviewed by Nancy Pelosi, 
which would sound like a pretty awkward thing if it had hap-
pened at any other venue.
“We may have disagreed in the past, and today we will dis-
agree in the future,” Colbert said, according to a Democratic aide who supplied a readout of his visit to Politico.
“Not sure if American people care either way , Congress less 
popular than colonoscopies … but just edging out our meth labs 
and gonorrhea,” he said. “Ironically, the last things we make in 
the United States.”
Despite his failed attempts to run for the U.S. Senate, we 
would really appreciate it if Colbert would keep trying. If there’s any comedian or pundit who should represent the American people legally , it’s Colbert. He fools politicians on a daily basis on his Comedy Central show, so he could do that as a political position, and we would fully support it. How does he feel about women? Because women are somehow a hot-button political is-
sue in this country, even though we are just people.
“Some of my best friends are women,” he said at the retreat. 
“I spent nine months in one.”
“The event closed with Colbert and Rep. Joe Crowley, D-N.Y., 
singing ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ together,” according to an 
article on The Washington Post’s website.
What more could you want in a candidate? His persona, who 
hosts his late night show, and his real personality present fans and constituents with the best of both worlds: He’s a little bit 
conservative, and he’s a little bit rock ‘n’ liberal. Colbert could 
represent every extreme of America if we let him — if the Amer-ican public was only dumb enough to let it happen. If there’s one state that we had to convince to do something, it might be pretty easy to sway South Carolina. Let’s face it, it’s no Northeast.
“Colbert actually has a non-farcical connection to the House 
Democratic caucus — his sister, Elizabeth Colbert-Busch, is run-ning in a special election for South Carolina’s 1st District,” ac-cording to Politico. “But as a Democrat, she faces an uphill battle 
in this Republican-tilted territory. But her brother was conﬁ  dent, 
telling House Democrats Friday, ‘She’s going to win.’” Maybe Sister Colbert would be just as good of an option as Brother Col-bert sounds.
“As a broadcast journalist I am obligated to maintain pure 
objectivity,” Colbert said about his sister during an episode of “The Colbert Report” last week, before the House Democrat retreat, according to the Christian Science Monitor. “It doesn’t matter that my sister is intelligent, hardworking, compassion-
ate and dedicated to the people of South Carolina. I will not be 
mentioning any of that on my show.”
Do the right thing for once, South Carolina. Now’s your 
chance. Don’t mess it up.
‘Imagine’ that this makes sense to you
I’ve always had a strange obsession with the John Len-
non song “Imagine.” For those of you America-hating morons who dismiss John Lennon as a socialist, you may 
as well stop reading now. I can’t say anything to you that you haven’t already dismissed with arguments about how 
the real world ostensibly works and how anyone who sees 
ﬂ  aws in the culture of late capitalism is too naïve to succeed. I look forward to your letters. (Side note — yes, I’ve heard the Rush Limbaugh “Imagine there’s no liberals” interpretation. It was irreverent, hilarious and not unenjoyable to listen to.)
Let’s take a necessarily abstract look at how the music of 
“Imagine” contributes to the overall effect of the song. One of the direct lyrical ancestors of “Imagine” was a Yoko Ono poem (I know), which reads in its delicious entirety, “Imag-
ine the clouds dripping. Dig a hole in your garden to put 
them into.” This is relevant because the evocative image that a Rolling Stone critic came up with to describe the way the piano chords ﬂ  ow under Lennon’s ethereal voice is “pil-lowy” — a description suggesting the softness and lightness of clouds.
The serenity in the vocal melody allows us to ﬂ  oat away, 
above the chord-clouds, into the atmosphere. While we’re up there, words of peace and comfort dance around us with the 
sunlight in semidazzling patterns of shifting color.
What words they are! It’s admittedly easy to dismiss 
“Imagine” as overly hippie-ish and totally unrealistic poetry 
— except, let’s not. I love what Ringo said about the lyrics in response to the outcry calling them socialist propaganda: “[John] said ‘imagine,’ that’s all. Just imagine it.”
Dig a hole in the garden of your minds to let the clouds 
drip into. Let the ideas — peace, a brotherhood of man — germinate there, and they will put down roots.
That’s the point of “Imagine,” and really , of John Lennon’s 
whole philosophy.
We can’t change the world, but we can change ourselves.When one of us consciously decides to stop hating others 
— to stop looking for the bad in everyone and instead look past it — everyone around them beneﬁ  ts. In an imperceptible and indescribable way , they do beneﬁ  t. Every time someone on the street smiles at me instead of walking past with his or her eyes averted, I leave that mo-ment brighter on the inside. For a second, I almost forget the horrors of the world.
Because the world is horriﬁ  c.
Every day there is senseless 
murder, greed to the point of 
avarice, misunderstanding to the point of hatred. Why?
We commit atomic violences 
against ourselves and others constantly because success is getting ahead. Being ahead necessarily implies that someone is behind you.
Success is winning. To win you have to beat someone. 
So, we convince ourselves that to be happy and comfortable someday, it’s OK to inﬂ  ict pain today.
If we don’t like what we see in the mirror, we attack 
the smallest weaknesses in ourselves until they disappear, whimpering. If we see weakness in others, we pick at it until the scab comes off and they bleed. We laugh and move on, satisﬁ  ed that they are weak and we are strong.
And someday, because of our strength, we say, we’ll be 
rich. We’ll be powerful and successful. We’ll have everything 
we want.
But, if everything we want is money , will we ever be rich 
enough? If everything we want is power, will we ever have 
enough control? If everything we want is strength, will we ever be able to push the mountains out of the way?
I’m poor. I’m powerless. I’m weak.And yet, things really aren’t that bad.I can laugh. I can sing. I can smile.Why should I engage in destruction just so I can “suc-
ceed?”
You may say that I’m a dreamer — that I’m a socialist, 
left-leaning, naïve idiot with no concept of reality — but I’m not the only one.
I hope someday you’ll join us, and the wo-o-o-orld will 
live as one.

The article in Friday’s Alligator about a 
Swamp Party email sent to UF fraterni-ty house representatives describes what 
“business as usual” is for the party in power.
Business as usual is treasurers of each fra-
ternity cutting Swamp Party checks for $250, no questions asked, because “it is done every 
semester” and it’s “nothing new.”
Business as usual is using the “I V oted” 
stickers to publicly shame brothers into voting 
for Swamp Party.
Business as usual is preventing people from 
hearing different viewpoints by slamming the door in the opposing party’s face.And I know it’s business as usual because 
I’ve been there.
When I was a sophomore, I was a house 
representative for the Sigma Phi Epsilon fra-ternity.
My job was to collect as many “I Voted” 
stickers from my brothers as I could and to 
make sure those who hadn’t voted yet made 
it to the polls.
However, this lack of individual political 
freedom led me to be so frustrated and so dis-enfranchised with the system that I decided I 
couldn’t be involved with it anymore. So for 
the last two years, I ignored Student Govern-ment.
But this year, I decided I couldn’t ignore 
it anymore. I decided it was time to stand up 
for what’s right for all students — to stand up 
for fair representation at UF and free elections during which no one is coerced into voting a certain way.
As a Greek, I know the importance of the 
Greek community and its ideas. I believe SG will greatly beneﬁ  t from including students from all backgrounds and organizational af-ﬁ  liations. By working together, we can better 
serve the interests of every student at UF.  
Erasing the divide between the Greek com-munity and other students at UF is crucial to 
making SG an institution we can be proud of.
If elected, my administration will never 
judge people based on their organizational af-ﬁ  liation. Instead, we will select the best, most qualiﬁ  ed candidates students, who are both Greek and non-Greek.
Students Party isn’t a party just for Greeks 
or just for non-Greeks. It is a party for all UF students — a party to which everyone’s in-vited.  
Johnny Castillo
Student Body President candidate
The Students PartyLetter to the Editor
Swamp Party strives to put the students at the forefront of 
all its efforts. All of Swamp Party’s accomplishments have directly beneﬁ  ted students and student organizations.
A driving factor in Swamp Party’s proactive efforts is its mo-
tivated leaders. Swamp Party chose its leaders because of their 
qualiﬁ  cations and professionalism. Its leaders are actively en-
gaged with student organizations and constantly work to im-prove student life.
Joseph Michaels and Elliot Grasso exemplify unbiased lead-
ership in Student Government. These individuals’ accomplish-
ments have supported student organizations and enabled them 
to reach their full potentials.
Joseph Michaels is the chairman of the Budget and Appro-
priations committee in Student Senate. Prior to his unanimous Student Senate appointment as chairman, he was the longest standing committee member, held two liaison positions within the committee and worked with the past chairperson to eliminate wasteful spending and allow a 6.5 percent increase to each SG-funded organization’s budget.
As budget hearings approach, he 
continues to meet with countless orga-nizations to ensure they are comfortable with the budgeting process and under-stand the guidelines by which they must abide.
“I don’t claim to be a perfect human being, but to attack me in 
such a way is not indicative of the principles I hope to promote at the University of Florida. I am doing my best to work for the stu-dents of this university, and I do not apologize for that. I continue to stand by Swamp Party, as we represent results and a vision for the future,” Michaels said.
Elliot Grasso is the chairman of the Student Senate Allocations 
Committee. Under his leadership, the Allocations Committee in-creased its outreach to student organizations and improved the allocations request process. Grasso implemented the ﬁ  rst Alloca-tions Committee workshop. More than 30 organizations learned how to submit allocations requests and gained a deeper under-standing of how the request process works. 
“Elliot Grasso’s dedication to the Allocations Committee and 
to the students of this university is apparent in all his hard work and accomplishments,” said Joshua Comiter, Allocations Com-mittee vice-chairman. 
The previous attack on Swamp Party leadership is an expected 
response from a party that has historically focused on defamation rather than results for the students.
These allegations are not only baseless — as the codes that 
govern SG Finance do not allow SG ofﬁ  cials to unjustly withhold funds from organizations — but deceptive, as they are used to hide what Swamp Party truly values: results, experience and mo-tivated leaders.
Do not be fooled by the groundless accusations. We are here to 
represent the students. Together for tomorrow, we advocate for every student and student organization.

Speaking OutThe executive branch has been ﬂ  exing its unconsti-
tutional muscles lately.
The Transport Security Administration, under 
the Department of Homeland Security, under the ofﬁ  ce of the president, has been up to no good.
The TSA targeted several train stations last month for 
its activities. Special TSA teams, called VIPR teams, start-ed searching passengers’ luggage with no explanation.
The TSA has been spotted on highways engaging in 
the same kind of behavior. Despite the casual manner in which the TSA searches people, the Fourth Amend-
ment protects American citizens from “unreasonable 
searches and seizures.” This means that any searches and seizures that take place without a search warrant or without probable cause to believe a crime is being com-mitted are unlawful.
Yet, these are just the kinds of searches that the TSA 
does on a routine basis. In 2011, the TSA ran more than 9,300 unannounced checkpoints and search operations.
Why is the TSA permitted to continue with these vio-
lations?
I think part of it is that many of us are complacent.We’re not concerned enough to care.It’s to the point that people might see an informed 
citizen as being supererogatory.
How often do we decide that politics is a pain, and 
we’ll leave it to somebody else?
How often do we prefer to be blissfully uninformed, 
mistakenly assuming that informing ourselves won’t make a difference?
The fact is that it does make a difference when even 
a single person informs himself or herself, and it is criti-cally important that we all do so.
Why is it so important?Because the moment any of us start looking away 
and not caring, and that sentiment ﬁ  nds its way into our culture and becomes popular, the people upstairs can rob us blind.
Whether it’s the state trying to take away our rights or a corporation trying to poi-son us, someone is probably trying to harm us. It’s up to us, the populace, to be the conscience of these groups — to keep them in line.
Bear in mind that the TSA 
is only one example of how the government violates our rights on a daily basis.
We’ve slipped up dur-
ing the years with making sure our Congress has been moral, and now it’s popular for congresspersons to ac-cept bribes.
We call it lobbying.We’ve also slipped up during the years with making 
sure our presidents are moral, and now it’s routine for them to approve of torture. The current president has even had American citizens killed with drones, which means they never even got a trial.
He is also expanding his drone war in Africa and the 
drone ﬂ  eet in general.
To think that as a Nobel Peace Prize winner and the 
leader of the free world, President Barack Obama contin-ues to approve of such atrocities and remain unchecked by the general public is unthinkable.
Unfortunately , the majority of people don’t seem to 
care, even when it comes to elections. The United States has repeatedly had one of the poorest voter turnouts of the countries compared in analyses.
What are the odds that things will get better by them-
selves, without the public getting involved? Not very high, I think.
We must all commit to informing ourselves and con-
tributing.
Anything short of that would be a moral failure and 
will hurt us all.

Vine Bread & Pasta bakery has 
served organic foods to the com-
munity in the warehouses in front of Satchel’s Pizza for more than a year.
Now, the bakery plans to move 
to Main Street to become a restau-rant.
Teresa Zokovitch and Dean 
Griebel co-own the bakery , 1801 NE 23rd Ave., Unit C2. They are cam-paigning to raise $20,000 to relocate downtown.
“There’s no bakery downtown, 
so that’s first and foremost,” Zoko-
vitch said. “We’ll improve the build-
ing. We’ll provide cafe space, so people can come and have a cup of coffee and a croissant.”
Zokovitch and Griebel are com-
mitted to the new location. They will relocate Vine even if the bakery only gets $5,000 from the campaign, Griebel said.
The bakery’s campaign, which 
is posted on www.indiegogo.com, has raised about $6,000 from about 80 donors. There are eight days until the campaign’s deadline.
“The crowdfunding is a new 
model of helping business like this get its start,” said Satchel Raye, the owner of Satchel’s Pizza. “By a $20 
donation, a lot of people can chip 
in and have a great addition to the community.”
The owners of Vine plan to relo-
cate the bakery to 627 N. Main St., a location the owners have been inter -
ested in for a year.
The new spot will give the own-
ers a chance to reconstruct the build-ing and get a license to become a restaurant. They will serve organic bread and pasta made with home-grown ingredients.
Last summer, Zokovitch and 
Griebel said, they realized the ware-house where the business is located did not satisfy the vision they have for the bakery.
“We want a self-enclosed build-
ing that is accessible to the commu-nity,” Zokovitch said.
Zokovitch said that during the 
summer, the warehouse would reach more than 110 degrees. They also had to send customers to shared public bathrooms.
“It’s kind of off the street and out 
of the way ,” Zokovitch said. “We don’t get the traffic in here that we would like to get.”  
The bakery has grown quickly 
since it started in June 2011 at the Union Street Farmers Market. It then sold to Citizen’s Co-op, Ward’s Supermarket and restaurants, Zoko-vitch said.
The more often customers sug-
gested new products, the more the bakery was able to expand their 
menu, the owners said.
“I feel like they are making a 
product that is not really available,” 
Raye said. “It’s kind of a European- style artisan bread.”
Raye said he supports Vine’s 
campaign and idea to relocate downtown because he believes in the bakery’s potential.
“What they need to make a vi-
able business model is they need to sell their products more to the consumer,” said Raye. “I think that is where the move is really going to help them the most is that they’ll get their product in front of the cus-tomer.”
He said he feels that if the bakery 
had a location where it had some ex-posure, it could double its business.
“I imagine something really 
pleasant and just like home,” Zoko-vitch said. “I want to bring my home to the community.”8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2013

IDEAL was a group of student am-
bassadors to UF’s Department of Stu-
dent Activities and Involvement that provided services to students looking to get involved.
This Spring, the Involvement Team, 
or IT, will replace IDEAL, with a new face but similar goals.
IT will work closely with the de-
partment, which helps students get in-volved on campus and supports regis-tered student organizations, according to its website.
In an effort to rebrand itself, IDEAL 
dissolved last month and showcased its new organization at the Involve-ment Team Open House on Jan. 31.
“[IDEAL] had a really high demand 
in [its] services last semester, and we just noticed that we needed to go in a new direction and create new structure in order to meet the demands of those students,” said former IDEAL member 
Lindsey Woods, a 21-year-old family , 
youth and community sciences and so-ciology senior.
The new IT structure consists of 
three different teams that provide spe-cialized services to students: one-on-one involvement consultations, work-shops and events.
In addition, IT will reach out to a 
broader student population than that of IDEAL, said IT Program Coordina-tor Jessica Inman.
“We will be having programming 
for the Innovation Academy students particularly ,” she said. “We’re also going to have a heavy presence at Pre-view.”
Student consultants for IT said the 
name change will help students more quickly associate what the organiza-tion does and what kind of services it provides.
“In the past, IDEAL has been diffi-
cult to identify with the Department of Student Activities and Involvement,” said former IDEAL member Steven 
Evens, a 19-year-old economics sopho-
more.
Pharmacy freshman Elaine Del Ro-
sario, 19, was one of about 45 students who attended IT’s open house. Del Rosario said that as first-year students, they hoped IT would help provide them with tailored recommendations for involvement opportunities.
IT members are trained to help stu-
dents find their involvement niche on campus.
“You come to the University of 
Florida to obtain an education, but you don’t want your diploma to be orange, blue and manila,” Evens said. “You want to be able to say you did such and such a thing, you executed these events 
and that you were able to lead an orga-
nization toward a common goal.”Student group IDEAL will 
now be Involvement Team� THE COURSE IS FROM MARCH 4 TO 
MARCH 8.

UF students and Gainesville residents will 
have the chance to solve crimes with the open-
ing of a crime scene investigations course.
Crime Scene Investigation Academy of Flori-
da, 12787 U.S. Highway 441 in Alachua, has pre-
viously been open only to law enforcement. But 
now it will open its doors to the public.
The 40-hour training course is designed for 
those who are interested in entering the crime scene investigation field, said CSI Academy Manager Debbie Mongiardo. Students will re-ceive credits to become certified in crime scene investigation.
The course will be from March 4 to March 8. 
Each class will run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
“We want to give students who are interest-
ed in crime scene investigation an opportunity to explore the field and get hands-on experience in an area that they are passionate about,” Mon-giardo said.
For enrollment, applicants must have a high 
school diploma, be at least 18 years old and pass a background check.
Mongiardo said the academy will accept the 
first 20 people who apply on the academy’s web-site or via telephone.
The course will consist of lectures and hands-
on activities, which include lifting fingerprints, labeling evidence and analyzing blood spatter, Mongiardo said.
“Students will be in and out of simulated 
crime scenes all week,” she said.
Marc Trahan, an instructor at the academy , 
said the activities will give students more experi-ence in crime scene investigations.
“It gives the student everything that they need to have a good foundation for having an ability to process and present their cases for court,” he said.
At Gainesville Police, officers are usually 
hired within the department to crime scene in-vestigations, said GPD Spokesman Officer Ben Tobias.
Although getting into the forensics field can 
be a two- to three-year process, Tobias said, stu-dents can use the skills they learn in the academy when they apply for jobs.
“Having gone through the CSI Academy will 
give them a little bit of edge because they already have the knowledge and that training,” he said.
Upon completing the training, students will 
receive a CSI kit and a certificate of completion for the 40 credit hours, which can be applied to-ward his or her crime scene certification, Mon-giardo said.
Michael Thompson, director of the academy , 
said students will also leave with a portfolio of their work, which will include crime scene pho-tographs, sketches and castings.
The academy is the only private school in 
Florida that teaches crime scene investigation.
In November, the Florida Department of 
Education granted the academy its provisional license, and the school started teaching classes to law enforcement officials the next month, Mon-giardo said.
Trahan said the classes can be beneficial not 
only to students and officers, but also to the pub-lic.
“When we have the best chance to get the 
best evidence that we can possibly get,” he said, “we’ll have better evidence to get somebody off the street, and that makes the public safer.”CSI academy now open to public
“Students will be in and out of 
simulated crime scenes all week.”

UF men’s basketball beat writer Landon Watnick joins host Greg Luca 
to discuss the Gators’ 1-1 week, the loss of Will Yeguete to injury  and 
how coach Billy Donovan’s team will fare in the latest polls.Hannah Rogers and the Florida softball team began the season with five victories at the Kajikawa Classic in Tempe, Ariz. See story, page 15.

Junior Scottie Wilbekin (5) attempts a layup during UF’s 83-58 victory against Mississippi 
State on Saturday in the O’Connell Center. Freshman Michael Frazier II replaced Wilbekin in the starting lineup because coach Billy Donovan said Wilbekin lacked energy in practice.
� MICHAEL FRAZIER II STARTED IN 
PLACE OF SCOTTIE WILBEKIN.
KATIE AGOSTIN
Alligator Staff Writer
 
Florida expected a shorthanded front-
court in Saturday’s game against Mis-
sissippi State. On Friday, junior forward Will Yeguete underwent arthroscopic surgery to remove bone chips in his 
right knee, which will sideline him for 
4-6 weeks.
Still, the Gators expected to have the 
same starting lineup.
But after lacking energy in Thursday 
and Friday’s practice, Scottie Wilbekin was held out of the starting lineup and Michael Frazier II took his place.
“It wasn’t a bad attitude, it wasn’t 
that he wasn’t trying, it wasn’t like he quit; it was nothing like that,” coach Billy Donovan said.
“(He was) just not his normal Scottie 
Wilbekin self in practice (on Thursday). And it continued on Friday. I just told him, ‘Listen, we’re coming off a tough loss against Arkansas, we need energy, we need passion, and if you’re not go-
ing to play with passion, we’re going 
to start someone else.’ … It’s more me making that decision, because I hold Scottie Wilbekin in such a higher regard as it relates to those kind of things.” 
Although Donovan wanted to send a 
message to Wilbekin, the junior guard only sat for the first 2:39 and ended up registering a team-high 33 minutes.
Still, Wilbekin learned his lesson. During Florida’s 78-64 win against 
Ole Miss on Feb. 2 and its 80-69 loss to Arkansas on Tuesday, Wilbekin shot the ball 30 times and only recorded 11 assists. Prior to those games, Wilbekin 
only averaged 7.1 shots per game.But in the No. 2 Gators’ (19-3, 9-1 
Southeastern Conference) 83-58 win against the Bulldogs (7-15, 2-8 SEC) on 
Saturday, Wilbekin only put up four shots and dished out seven assists.
“Scottie is having an unbelievable 
year,” Donovan said. “He’s played re-ally, really well, and he’s done really good things for our team. I felt like com-ing out of the Arkansas game, he need-ed to understand that there were things 
that he needed to do for our team. … I 
kind of was on him about just making some better decisions and getting us in and out of offense in a difficult place, on the road.” 
While Wilbekin was benched, Fra-
zier picked up his first career start at Florida.
Frazier recorded 11 points on 4-for-
7 shooting, six rebounds, three assists and a steal to energize the Gators in Wil-bekin and Yeguete’s absence. 
With 14:06 left in the first half, Frazi-
er started Florida’s early 19-5 run with a three-pointer to put the Gators up 10-5. In the next two minutes, Frazier picked up two more threes, a rebound, a steal and an assist to help widen UF’s lead to 
18-10.
“I just try to come in and provide 
energy for the team however I can do 
that,” Frazier said.
Although the Gators had another 
dominant double-digit win against the Bulldogs on Saturday, Donovan believes Florida needs to improve its defense be-fore hosting Kentucky on Tuesday.
“I still think we need to get better 
(defensively),” Donovan said. “Any-time you lose a guy like Will Yeguete, 
your defense is going to be different. … 
We’ve got to get even more focused de-fensively than we’ve been.”

Hoping to improve its  NCAA Tourna-
ment chances, the Gators grinded out an 
important comeback victory on Sunday. 
Florida (15-9, 4-6 Southeastern Confer -
ence) overcame a turnover-filled, poorly 
played first half to send Auburn to its 
eighth consecutive loss, beating the Tigers 65-57 in Auburn Arena. 
 “A tremendous second-half effort,” 
coach Amanda Butler said. “We played about 30 minutes of good basketball, may-be 28. (We) had a really , really slow start. I’m really proud of our team for not letting that set the tone for the whole game.” 
Florida struggled to gain momentum 
in the first half. Following a field goal by freshman Christin Mercer less than 2 min-utes into the con-
test, the Gators were held scoreless for the next 7:03 as Auburn took an 11-2 lead. 
Poor shooting has plagued the Gators 
early in SEC play, and turnovers com-pounded the problem against the Tigers. Florida wins second 
straight conference game

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The Gators 
made history in 2012, advancing to their 
first-ever Final Four.
But the 2013 team already found a way 
to one-up last year’s squad: it left Chapel Hill with a win.
No. 3 Florida (1-0) came from behind 
and scored five unanswered goals to de-feat No. 5 North Carolina 5-3 on Saturday at Fetzer Field in Chapel Hill, N.C.
The win was the first for the Gators in 
the program’s four-year history against 
the Tar Heels.
Florida lost its season opener at UNC 
in 2011 10-9 in overtime and 11-9 last sea-
son.“It’s amazing,” senior midfielder Brit-
tany Dashiell said. “The past three years 
we’ve lost to them and just to finally beat 
them, it felt like an incredible accomplish-ment and a great start to our season this 
year.”
The Tar Heels jumped 
out to a 3-0 lead in the first 8 minutes of the game thanks to a goal by junior Taylor George and 
two from Abbey Friend, 
who scored a hat trick against the Gators in 
2012.
Coach Amanda O’Leary called a tim-
eout after the Tar Heels’ third goal, and North Carolina didn’t score from that UF earns first win against UNC

Bask etballUF made just 1 of its first 9 shots and 
turned the ball over seven times before 
freshman January Miller connected on a three-point field goal to snap the Gators’ extended scoring drought. 
Florida turned the ball over 15 times 
in the contest. 
“People will look at Auburn’s record 
and only winning two games in the SEC and think this isn’t a good team, and that’s just not true,” Butler said. “It’s huge for us just to continue building that momentum.”
Consistent offense was difficult to 
find for either team throughout the game. Each shot 33.3 percent from the floor. 
However, UF exposed an undersized 
Auburn squad.
Mercer and senior Jennifer George 
combined for 23 points on 11-of-23 shoot-ing. The pair helped UF dominate inside, outscoring Auburn 30-18 in the paint and outrebounding the Tigers 48-35. 
“In the first 4 minutes we struggled, 
so we wanted to come out in the second half and the end of the first half and show our will,” George said. 
Leading 39-38 in the second half, the 
Gators used a 12-3 run to open a 51-41 advantage with 7:16 remaining. 
Despite poor shooting from the three-point line — the Gators made just 5 of 18 attempts on Sunday — UF’s run was bol-stered by junior Lily Svete.
As Auburn (13-11, 2-9 SEC) attempted 
to clog the middle and limit the effective-ness of Mercer and George, Svete found space to shoot. She connected on three attempts from behind the arc during a 
3:39 span in the second half.
“People watch us play and scout us, 
and they’ve got to have an answer for 
our low block,” Butler said. “Jennifer gets a lot of attention, and that allows Lily … to find her spot and find her shot. She is doing a great job of knocking those down.”
Freshman Sydney Moss rounded out 
a balanced offensive effort for the Gators, who won at Auburn for the first time since 2004. Moss scored nine points while notching 11 rebounds and six assists. 
“That’s what you are supposed to do 
after a bye week,” Butler said.
“When we finally shook that off and 
decided how good Auburn was and ex-perienced how we needed to play to beat 
them, I thought we made great changes 
in intensity.”

Taylor Burke reached new 
heights on Saturday.
The sophomore jumper broke 
Florida’s 21-year-old record in the 
women’s high jump at the Virginia 
Tech Elite Meet in Blacksburg, Va. 
Clearing a height of 1.86m, Burke surpassed Maria Galloni’s record of 1.85m set at the 1992 Southeastern Conference Championships.
“Taylor was really fun to watch 
today,” coach Mike Holloway said. “She’s really getting into a rhythm, and I think she’s been working well with coach (Mellanee) Welty to get ready for performances like this.”
At both the Virginia Tech Elite 
Meet and Husky Classic in Seattle on Friday and Saturday, the Gators placed in nearly every event they competed in and notched 12 victo-
ries.
“I’m extremely proud of every-
one,” Holloway said. “Lately, I feel 
like we’ve been too focused on run-ning fast, jumping far (and) throw-ing far. We challenged our athletes to be focused and really think about executing.”
Sophomore jumper Marquis 
Dendy posted a NCAA best for 
2013 in the men’s long jump with a 
distance of 7.99m on Friday. Along with Dendy, sprinters Eddie 
Lovett and Kyra 
Jefferson each set personal records on Friday, win-
ning the men’s 60m hurdles and women’s 60m dash, respectively.
“I’m incredibly pleased with Marquis, Eddie and Kyra tonight,” Holloway said. “Eddie and Kyra [set personal records], and Marquis jumped the best he’s jumped all year. I couldn’t be more proud.”
The Gators will compete in the 
2013 SEC Indoor Championships in Fayetteville, Ark., on Feb. 22-24. Despite Florida’s 12 wins during 
the weekend, Holloway stressed to 
his team the importance of moving on.
“We need to refocus and not 
rest on what we did tonight,” Hol-loway said. “We need to focus on execution and competing with the emphasis on technicality. We’re looking to go out there, compete and truly get better as we head into the championship portion of our season.”
In last season’s SEC Indoor 
Championships in Lexington, Ky., the women won the title, and the men finished second.
“The season starts now,” Hol-
loway said. “We have to go back to Gainesville and keep working hard, stay healthy and focused and make sure we taper and rest. We’ll do everything possible to be at our best in Fayetteville.”

UF overcame halftime deficit
point on. 
She credited goalkeeper Mikey Meagher 
— who saved nine of 12 shots on goal — for 
keeping the Gators in the game as the of-
fense struggled to find its footing.
“She was phenomenal,” O’Leary said. “Mikey tends to deliver every single 
time we ask her to come up big, and she certainly came up huge today. They were point-blank shots (on the) saves she was making.”
The game also marked the first time UF 
has ever won after trailing at halftime.
Midway through Saturday’s contest, 
Florida trailed 3-1 with its only goal com-ing on a Kitty Cullen free-position shot. 
Dashiell pulled the Gators within one 
point of the lead 5 minutes into the sec-ond half. Fellow senior Ashley Bruns tied the game in the 42nd minute and attacker Gabi Wiegand scored the go-ahead and fi-
nal goals.
North Carolina managed just five shots 
in the second half. Meagher credited the defense as a whole for the second-half shut-out.
“We communicated well,” Meagher 
said.
“We played for each other, which I 
thought was the most important part. We never stopped talking to one another.”
The Gators have an easy five-game 
stretch before they play Syracuse in Miami 
in a rematch of last season’s national semi-
final. 
Losing to UNC didn’t hamper UF mov-
ing forward last season, as the Gators 
went on to win their next four games. Still, Dashiell said the win, which was Florida’s 
first one against an Atlantic Coast Confer -
ence opponent, will serve as a confidence 
booster.
“It’ll keep us motivated, (and) just help 
us mentally believe that we can do it,” Dashiell said. “We can beat any team out there. I think we got the jitters out in this game, and we’ll be ready for Jacksonville on Wednesday.”

Florida waited 293 days for a second shot at Alabama.
After the Crimson Tide beat the Gators by .075 points at the 
2012 NCAA Super Six to claim last season’s national champi-onship, Florida finally got another chance at its Southeastern Conference rival on Friday. And the Gators put it all on the floor.
No. 1 Florida’s floor routine has been a project in the works 
for much of the season. But against No. 5 Alabama on Friday , it 
looked less like a weakness and more like a strength. 
The Gators peaked facing their best opponent this season.
Florida’s floor combination strung together four consecu-
tive scores of 9.9 or better in its final event to seal a 198.1-196.85 victory over Alabama.  
UF registered scores of at least 49.4 in each of the four events 
but saved its best for the floor routine. Florida entered the con-
test averaging 49.19, and Friday’s 
49.65 score is .375 more than its 
season-high against Arkansas on Feb. 1. 
“It was a great overall floor 
performance,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “Probably still not 100 percent at what we’ll probably do at the end but … pretty incredible.”
Prior to the exercise, Faehn asked Randy Stageberg to per -
form a double tuck instead of a full in her first pass, as Kiersten 
Wang was set to open her routine with a double layout for the 
first time. 
“It was nice to be able to see Randy humbly take the hit 
knowing that she wasn’t going to be doing what she normally would and still do an amazing routine,” Faehn said.
The competition wrapped up with the four strongest con-
tenders on Florida’s roster: Bridget Sloan, Ashanee Dickerson, Marissa King and Kytra Hunter. Each registered a score of 9.9 or higher, with Dickerson’s 9.975 the eighth near-perfect score on floor in UF history . 
 “That was the best routine of Ashanee’s four years here,” Faehn said. “It really was.”
Closing out the rotation was Kytra Hunter, who was bat-
tling the stomach flu and recovering from a ligament strain 
in her left ankle. She recovered from disappointing beam and 
bars routines to score a 9.95, her best mark of the season. Even with an injury-laden roster, Florida put on its best 
showing to date. With a strong effort on floor, UF progresses towards deploying full-strength lineups. 
“This is my first time being a part of a 198,” Dickerson said. 
“And I would’ve never thought we could do it.”ADAM LICHTENSTEIN

The Gators began the 2013 
season with three top-15 teams 
on the schedule at the Kajikawa 
Classic. Florida traveled to Tem-pe, Ariz., and left undefeated.
“It’s huge for us,” junior Han-
nah Rogers said. “I feel like our 
team knows now that they can beat top schools like that.”
No. 14 Florida (5-0) opened 
its season against Creighton (2-3) Friday afternoon. The bats ex-
ploded, and the Gators run-ruled 
the Bluejays 13-3 in five innings. 
Freshman second baseman 
Kelsey Stewart started the offen-sive barrage, leading off the game 
with a triple and hitting a home run in the fourth inning. 
But in the fifth, the offense 
multiplied, scoring eight runs, 
four of which came on a Kirsti Merritt grand slam.
But later that night, offense 
was at a premium.
Rogers took the mound for 
the first time this season against No. 5 Oregon (4-2) and, for the 
first three innings, she and Ducks 
hurler Jessica Moore kept the game scoreless. But in the bottom of the fourth, the Gators pushed across a run when Ensley Gam-
mel drove in freshman Taylore 
Fuller on a groundout.
Rogers locked down the final 
three innings, and Florida fin-
ished the first day undefeated.
“It’s always better to pitch 
with runs on the board,” Rogers 
said. “And also having an awe-some defense behind me, know-
ing that if I do get a ground ball, 
that they’re going to get the out.”
On Saturday, UF faced Cal 
State Northridge (1-4) and No. 3 
California (2-2). 
Sophomore Alyssa Bache 
got the start against Cal State 
Northridge. She had a solid out-ing, holding the Matadors score-
less despite walking five batters.
Freshmen again led the Florida 
offense, with Stewart and Mer -
ritt delivering two hits each, and Fuller knocking in two runs with 
a double and a sacrifice fly as the Gators cruised to a 7-0 victory.
“I just went in … trying to 
get my job done,” Stewart said. “Never did I think it would have been like that.”
The Gators had a tougher time 
against a strong Golden Bears team.
Florida took an early lead on 
RBI singles by sophomore Lau-
ren Haeger and junior transfer 
Stephanie Tofft. Cal battled back in the bottom of the third, scoring three runs, but UF took the lead for the final time in the fifth in-
ning, scoring three times en route 
to a 7-4 win.
Florida’s final opponent in the 
Classic was No. 13 Arizona (3-2). 
Much like the season opener, the 
Gators’ offense was explosive.
UF opened the game with five 
runs in the top of the first inning.  The Gators then notched two in 
the third and another run in the 
fifth. Still, Florida had one more outburst left.
In the top of the seventh, with 
the Gators leading 8-3, sopho-more Bailey Castro came in to pinch hit for Haeger with the bases loaded. She capped a six-run inning and the tournament 
with a grand slam.
“The sky’s the limit with this 
team,” coach Tim Walton said. “I 
think we’re good right now, and 
we’re only going to continue to 
get better.”MONDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Florida started its spring season with a disap-
pointing performance after the men finished in 
fourth place on their home course. 
The Gators, playing in their only home tourna-
ment of the season at Mark Bostick Golf Course, started strong and led after the first round of the SunTrust Gator Invitational.
But Florida saw its lead slowly slip away in 
the second round against Florida State.
“We didn’t have anything this week,” coach 
Buddy Alexander said.
“We didn’t play well, we didn’t think well, 
we didn’t putt well. We didn’t play smart, and it was pretty disappointing.” 
T.J. Vogel and Tyler McCumber, the Gators 
top two starters, struggled throughout the tour -
nament.
The seniors couldn’t find their groove. Vogel, who is still recovering from hernia sur -
gery he underwent in December, shot an unchar -
acteristic tournament total of 216 (+6).
McCumber also finished over par with a 213 
(+3) after battling flu-like symptoms all week-end.
Vogel and McCumber finished tied for 25th 
and tied for 17th, respectively.
The results may have been worse for the 
Gators if not for their depth with the play of San-tiago Gavino and J.D. Tomlinson.
Gavino appeared in just two tournaments in 
the fall and averages a 75, but he shot a team-best 67 in the final round to tie for 12th.
Tomlinson, a sophomore who has four top-10 
finishes in his career, posted rounds of 69, 72 and 
72 to finish 3 over par for the weekend tourna-
ment. 
“Today I started off not too good,” Gavino said.
“I was three over through six, and then I bird-
ied seven and came back on the back end and shot 5 under, so that was pretty big. ... I made some bad mistakes, but I’ve got to learn from 
them.
“Overall, my game is pretty good right now. 
I’ve got to work on it, and I should be good for 
the next tournament.”
Still, the biggest surprise of the tournament 
was not only the play of Eric Banks, but that Banks was playing at all.
Coach Alexander expressed doubt that the 
sophomore would play at all this season after 
undergoing open-heart surgery last summer. 
Banks proved that he has not only recovered 
but ready to get back to his starting role with the 
team. Banks competed as an individual, but had the best weekend of any Gator.
He finished tied for 10th with a tournament 
total of 211 (+1). 
However, no effort from the Gators could sur -
pass the Seminoles.
Florida State placed three players in the top 
10, including the individual winner, Daniel Berg-er, who shot 203 (-7). 
The Seminoles were the lone team to finish 
under par (-8). North Florida placed second with 
a score of 7 over par, while South Alabama fin-
ished third at 10 over par — one shot better than Florida.
“[Florida] has such a great golf team, and 
their coaches are phenomenal,” FSU coach Trey Jones said.
“To come in here and beat them, you know 
you’re going to have to play exceptional. We made a few putts this week and played well, but 
we knew going in the odds were not in our fa-
vor with the type of program they have and how they’re playing at this event.”UF disappoints at Gator Invitational
