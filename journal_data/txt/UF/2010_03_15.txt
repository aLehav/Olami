THE INDEPENDENT
INVESTIGATION.

An independent investiga-
tion into the March 2 University
Police shooting of a UF gradu-
ate student at Corry Village is
underway, said UF President
Bernie Machen in an e-mail to
students, faculty and staff Fri-
day.
Margolis, Healy & Associ-
ates, apublic safetyorganization
specializing in school security,
is working with the Florida De-
partment of Law Enforcement
to collect data and interview
witnesses to resolve concerns
about the shooting of Kofi Adu-Brempong, Machen said.
Adu-Brempong, the 35-year-
old Ghanaian graduate student
who faces charges of resisting
arrest and aggravated assault,
was shot in the face by UPD
officer Keith Smith after a two-
hour standoff.
Although he was initially
placed in crit-
ical condition
after suffer-
ing hand and
jaw injuries,
he is now
able to com-

facial expressions, said Larry
Turner, Adu-Brempong's law-
yer.

Site offers parking
By SAMANTHA DELGADO
Alligator Contributing Writer
A Web site created by UF students
could ease the pain associated with find-
ing parking in Gainesville.
Sargent White, a UF masters student
in finance and information systems,
joined about six of his friends to launch
ParkontheFly.com in December to give
users the chance to use cell phones or
computers to reserve parking spots in
lots across the city.
The site is hosting a kick-off promo-
tion today in an empty lot at University
Avenue and Southwest 13th Street.
Users who park in the lot near Mc-
Donald's get two free weeks of parking.After registering with ParkontheFly.
com, users can go to the site and click on
a map with one of seven lot locations to
reserve a spot near their destination. The
locations range from lots downtown to
Southwest 34th Street. With a credit or
debit card, they pay 40 to 80 cents per
hour to lot's owner and can
On the print out passes, White said.Web ParkontheFly.com may re-
ceive a portion of profits.
Scott Fox, transportation services di-
rector, said the system could impact the
university's sustainability campaign.
"Do we want to encourage and pro-

Google pushes broadband
By MATT HARRINGER
Alligator Writer
Google plans to make broadband In-
ternet look slow, and Gainesville might be
one of the first cities to surf the new ultra-
high-speed Web.
Google wants to provide Internet speeds
more than 100 times faster than what most
Americans have access to with new fiber-
to-the-home connections, according to the
company's corporate Web site.
The goal is to make Internet access bet-
ter and faster for everyone, but the com-
pany first needs to build and test the net-
work. Gainesville has applied to be one of
the trial locations.
Cox Communications Premier Internet
service, which costs about $65 per month,
offers speeds up to 20 megabytes per sec-
ond, according to the company's Web site.
Google's experimental network will deliver"If the students get behind it and
start to create ideas for new ap-
plications, that will enhance our
ability to be selected."

speeds of one gigabyte per second, mean-
ing Google's network would be 50 times
faster than what's offered in Gainesville.
These speeds parallel the network on
UF's campus, which runs at about one
gigabyte per second, according to Dave
Pokorney, UF's assistant director of net-
work services.
Pokorney said Google's potential Inter-
net network would be like going from rid-

Inmates let the dogs out
By MEG WAGNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Keith Skipper has taught MoJo, a 1-year-old
Basenji and Italian greyhound mix, everything he
knows.
He's taught him how to obey basic commands.
He's taught him how to play nicely with other
dogs and people. He's even taught him how to
jump through a hula hoop 3 feet off the ground.
Skipper, an inmate at Gainesville Work Camp,
spent eight weeks training MoJo as part of Paws on
Parole, a program that pairs inmates with rescued
dogs from Alachua County Animal Services.
On March 5, Skipper watched MoJo graduate.
"It's a great, great program and a real win-win
situation," said Hilary Hynes, Alachua County
Animal Services public education program coor-
dinator and Paws on Parole organizer.
Each class consists of six inmates partnered
with six dogs. For eight weeks, the inmates spend
about seven hours per day training their dogs,
teaching them basic commands, obedience and
social skills assisted by two professional trainers.
The dogs are put up for adoption for a $45
adoption fee once they graduate.
The program was founded a year ago, and
since then, 36 dogs have graduated.
Sgt. Eric Wooten, work squad sergeant andPaws on Parole organizer, said inmates learn pa-
tience and accountability by training the animals.
"It's a lot of responsibility, having to care for
another," Wooten said.
The dogs become more adoptable through their
training while the inmates learn how to properly
handle and care for the dogs, Hynes said.
"[The inmates] are just fantastic. They are great
with the dogs," Hynes said. "I'd hire any of them
as a dog trainer."
It's a great, great program and a
real win-win situation."
Hilary Hynes
Paws on Parole organizer
Many dogs that enter the program have been
abused or abandoned. Through the training, the
inmates help the dogs overcome some of these be-
havioral and psychological problems.
All six dogs in the latest graduating class were
adopted before they completed the program.
Steven Sanchez came from Altamonte Springs,
Fla., to pick up his graduate, MoJo. After finalizing
paperwork, and buckling on a New York Yankees
collar, MoJo was a member of the Sanchez family.

begin county position
By CINDY TAVERAS
Alligator Contributing Writer
After nearly 25 years with
Gainesville Fire Rescue, Fire
Chief Bill Northcutt will resign
this month to work with the Ala-
chua County Fire Rescue.
Northcutt's current salary
with the city is $113,061. As Ala-
chua County's chief of fire rescue
operations and deputy director
of the Department of Public Safe-
ty, his salary with the county will
be $107,000 a year.
The slight decrease will be
offset by pension benefits as well
as valuable personal and profes-
sional gains, Northcutt said.
"I think it provides me a lotofopportunities I wouldn't other-
wise have," he said. "Salary is
not everything."
He will oversee services the
city doesn't supply, such as su-
pervising ambulance and emer-
gency medical transport.
Northcutt, 53, has been
Gainesville's fire
Local chief for more than
News four years and the
deputy for about
six.
"Prepare yourself for where
you want to be so that you're
ready when the opportunity
comes," Northcutt said. "Be-
cause if you're not ready, you
won't be able to take advan-
tage when it comes your way."

SPOTLIGHT ON THE SWAMP
Drag racers hit raceway for Gatornationals event
* ABOUT 100,000 TICKETS
WERE SOLD FOR THE
ANNUAL DRAG RACE.
By MINCH MINCHIN
Alligator Writer
Campus may have been quiet
during Spring Break, but the
Gainesville Raceway was not.
The 41st annual Gatornation-
als drag racing competition took
place Friday, Saturday and Sun-
day.
About 100,000 tickets were
sold, and the event brought doz-
ens of drivers from all across the
country to participate in one of
the National Hot Rod Associa-
tion's most prestigious events.
Gatornationals held races for
several classes of vehicles, which
included motorcycles, funny
cars, and alcohol-burning drag-
ster cars.The dragsters, which are
known as "top fuel" vehicles, can
reach speeds of more than 300
mph and sounds exceeding 120
decibels.
They can be heard more than
five miles away.
"If you've got delicate ears,
you'd better stay away from
here," said 72-year-old Gene
Wester, who has worked at the
event for 14 years.
Though he is not a racing fan,
Wester said he keeps coming
back to work each year because
he loves the people the event at-
tracts.
"I love the smells and the
sounds," he said. "It's in your
blood."
Top fuel racer Tony Schu-
macher won his category Sunday
with runs that reached speeds of
324.98 mph and 322.04 mph, ac-
cording to a release on the NHRA
Web site.Members of the DHL and Head Inc. racing teams examine their vehicles moments before competing in

Students to rally against UPD
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Almost two weeks have passed since the
University Police Department shooting of UF
graduate student Kofi Adu-Brempong on March
2, and students plan to show their views on the
incident.
On Tuesday, The Coalition for Justice Against
Police Brutality, a group of students and commu-
nity activists, will be leading a rally to protest the
UPD shooting.
Protesters will meet at 11 a.m. on Turlington
Plaza and march to the University Police Depart-
ment and Emerson Alumni Hall to share their
concerns with UPD and the Board of Trustees.
Justin Wooten, the rally organizer, said the
protest will let students and other residents ex-
press their opinions about the charges brought
against Adu-Brempong and to protest the univer-
sity's handling of the situation.
Wooten said university administrators typi-
cally do not like dealing with controversial issues
because of their sensitive and difficult nature.
"The more people who come out and show
their support, the more of an impact it will have
on them," Wooten said.UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said the uni-
versity appreciates student efforts to express their
opinions through events such as rallies.
"Certainly, we embrace their ability to express
their concerns in that way," Sikes said.
Dave Schneider, another organizer of the
rally, said the group will ask for the punishment
of Keith Smith, the UPD officer who shot Adu-
Brempong, and for a thorough investigation of
the shooting.
Matthew Wooten, a UF alumnus who had a
class with Adu-Brempong but did
On not know him personally, said heCampus thinks the entire incident and UPD's
response is suspicious.
Wooten said he saw enough of Adu-Brempong
to understand he had physical disabilities.
He said he didn't think Adu-Brempong could
stand without his cane, let alone attack five police
officers.
"I think something really crazy happened, and
I smell something really fishy," he said.
Schneider said there have been instances in the
past in which UPD has dealt with students in a
questionable manner.
"This is unacceptable, and we're not going to
stand for it anymore," he said.

"We were advised by several
people that some students were
afraid to speak," he said. "We cer-
tainly don't want them to worry and
not come forward."
Student feedback to UF adminis-
tration about the incident has been
surprisingly low, he said.
The e-mail needed to be sent be-
fore the end of break so those return-
ing from vacation would be aware of
how the administration is handling
the situation, Machen said.
"Due to the unprecedented na-
ture of this incident, I believe, and
[UPD] Chief Linda Stump agrees,
we must go to extra lengths to fully
analyze every aspect." he said.
Though the results of the inves-
tigation could produce some policy
changes, Machen said UF is unlikely
to restrict gun use by UPD officers.

"I don't support applying a [gun]
ban to police officers," he said.
Turner said two sheriff's deputies
continually guard Adu-Brempong
while he recovers at Shands at UT.
Bond is being held at $10,000, but
it will not be posted, Turner said. As
long as Adu-Brempong is under the
custody of the department of the jail,
his medical expenses are covered by
the state and not his own insurance,
he said.
"If the government shot him,
they should pay to fix him," he said.

The Lowe Down
Voters should elect
Craig Lowe for mayor
Tuesday, Gainesville voters will decide the city's next
mayor, and residents who live near the UF campus
will also decide who will fill a City Commission spot.
For commission, The Editorial Board endorses Randy Wells,
who supports the city's anti-discrimination ordinance, equal
rights for domestic partners, diversity training and city support
of annual Pride Days.
He also supports environmental protection and closing the
Cabot/Superfund site. Wells serves on the City Planning Board,
chairs the Bicycle Pedestrain Advisory Board and the city's Af-
fordable Housing Advisory Committee. Wells would make an
excellent commissoner, and we trust him to represent us.
For mayor, The Editorial Board strongly supports Craig
Lowe. In his three terms as a commissioner, Lowe earned our
trust and proved he cares about people and the environment.
His platform includes pushing the Environmental Protection
Agency to clean up the Koppers Superfund site, developing the
local economy, supporting small businesses and defending the
jobs of the city's first responders, so firefighters and police can
focus on helping people. He also serves as chair of the city's
Equal Opportunity Committee and led a successful campaign
against the discriminatory Charter Amendment 1 last year,
which would have deleted protection for transgenders. He's
also involved in and has received awards from several local hu-
man rights and environmental organizations.
While amendments to the anti-discrimination ordinance will
not appear on ballots this election, candidates' positions on the
issue are a way to gauge their ability to represent Gainesville.
Richard Selwach opposed the anti-discrimination provi-
sions and supported the amendment that would have deleted
them. According to an e-mail sent out by the Human Rights
Campaign, Monica Cooper proved she wasn't familiar with the
amendment or the ordinance. When the interviewer asked Coo-
per's stance, it was clear she didn't know Charter Amendment
1 failed or even existed. Don Marsh plans to "fix the transgen-
der bathroom ordinance." When the IRC interviewer asked to
speak with him, he said Craig Lowe would "probably represent
[the campaign's] interests better than [Marsh] could."
These candidates' ignorance of or insensitivity to such an
important civil rights issue is alarming, and Lowe's record of
supporting equal rights assures us he is the right candidate.
The fifth candidate, Ozzy Angulo, supports the city's anti-
discrimination ordinance and has good ideas about support-
ing small businesses and protecting the environment, but he
opposes the Project Grace one-stop homeless center, which is a
necessary step in helping Gainesville's homeless. He also lacks
Lowe's experience and positive political history.
Don Marsh also opposes the center, saying it would attract
"societal malcontents." We won't elect a mayor who feels that
way about the homeless. Lowe has supported the center and
worked to convince the commission to support it.
His experience in city government and his continued sup-
port of human rights endeavors make him the clear choice.
Lowe would be the city's first openly gay mayor. Gainesville
has already established its reputation for being a progressive
city, and electing a gay mayor would be a step in the same di-
rection. Of course, we would not suggest that this is the reason
voters should choose Lowe, but it is another advantage to a can-
didate we would support regardless of his sexual orientation.
Lowe has also reached out to students and encourages their
involvement in the political process, as opposed to Cooper, who
said UF students "act like little children." We admit students
don't always make the best decisions, but we don't to be repre-
sented by someone who doesn't respect or understand us.
We're certain Craig Lowe does both, and we wholeheart-
edly endorse him and Randy Wells for tomorrow's election.

Col um nist p la ns to b uilld d in osa ur pa rk
bandoning the typical weeklong alcohol/Gatoradecycle set against a backdrop of sandy shorelines
(or, less frequently, powder-laden slopes), I sipped
not on 'tron, but water, and did so in the confines of my
own backyard. Had I adopted a new sense of responsibil-
ity for my health? Was it a case of middle school-reminis-
cent yardwork mandated by my parents, or was it perhaps
HGTV-triggered gardening mania? Don't be ridiculous -
I've got two words for you: dinosaur cage.
Emerging from Home Depot, trailer loaded with
enough pipe to make Eric Massa catch snorkel fever once
again, I spent several days welding together a velociraptor
cage Michael Crichton would have been proud of. Now, I
realize the terms "crazy," "insane," and "65 million years
too late" are thrown around a lot these days, but am I re-
ally any of these things? I think not.
Last week it was announced that Australian research-
ers had extracted DNA from the fossilized eggshells of
extinct birds varying in size from that of a duck to an
ostrich-dwarfing moa, the oldest sample of which being
some 20,000 years old. The scientists were only able to se-
quence a portion of the birds' genomes, but they stressed
that's just the first step in being able to artificially replicate
the entire thing. Some have suggested this may lead to the
artificially manufactured re-emergence of recently extinct
birds such as the dodo or passenger pigeon.
As for dinosaurs, the difference between samples tens
of thousands of years old and samples tens of millions
of years old is, well, three orders of magnitude (but I'm
sure those are just minor details). Furthermore, the team
stressed the as-of-late scientifically hypothetical proposi-
tion of reanimating long-dead megafauna. Sure, "hypo-
thetical" sounds disheartening, but that's just code for
"we're already picking out names for our pet T-Rex."
Well, I'm not fooled that easily, so that's why I'm getting
the early jump on this new breakthrough.So, when Democrats ram theiehealth care bill through Congress
like a runaway Prius through a
crowded San Diego freeway, I'll be
riding Rush Limbaugh's coattails
down to Costa Rica, dinosaur cage in
Ryan Spencer tow. Naturally, I'll have to figure out
letters@alligator org a way to hijack his OxyContin stash
and then attempt to extort enough
money out of him to purchase an is-
land on which to construct and maintain a dinosaur park.
Now if I could only figure out what to name it .
If all goes as planned (what could possibly go wrong?),
by the time the DNA-extraction technology gets up to
snuff, construction on my dinosaur island should be near-
ing completion, and the atmosphere should be so warm
and saturated in carbon dioxide that the dinosaurs won't
even realize they're in the wrong epoch.
Some questions might be raised concerning my profit-
ing off of "playing God," or perhaps concerning my deci-
sion to include "carnivorous dinosaurs" in the petting zoo
area, but either way, isn't ruthless exploitation the best
part about technology? Sure, the significance of a possible
biological mulligan is enticing and even redeeming in and
of itself, but as the saying goes, awesomeness is forged in
the fires of torpedo-damning.
I suppose forgoing better judgment is not all I'll have to
contend with, as there's always the possibility of fictional
history repeating itself (and the last thing I need is to be
in Central America while I'm being eviscerated by one of
my own products). Actually, now that I'm looking at these
incredibly sobering fares and bag-check fees for flights
down to Costa Rica, I'm starting to think I've gotten a little
ahead of myself -it's been a long Spring Break.

Univeristy Police Department used
excessive force
Like many people in the UF community,
I would like to know why five University
Police Department officers were unable to
physically restrain a student with disabili-
ties who was "armed" with a cane?
It is also hard to understand why armed
police officers felt their lives were in dan-
ger from a mentally ill person ranting and
raving in a locked apartment.
Did UPD officer Keith Smith really feel
so scared of Mr. Adu-Brempong that heneeded to shoot him in the face?
Who was more of a public threat?
I'd say the police were.
Keith Smith is one of a group of police
officers who was reprimanded for throw-
ing eggs at women from their cars in
Gainesville last summer.
At an absolute minimum, this officer's
poor judgment and aggressive tendencies
are a threat to public safety.
I find it absurd that the victim of this
shooting is being blamed by UPD for use
of excessive force.This smells like a cover-up.
Shame on you.

Tapes show Unite's agenda
he Unite Party claims to repre-sent the wants and needs of the
entire UF Student Body.
What a joke.
The audio/transcript released at
the Senate meeting March 2 undeni-
ably proves otherwise. Out of about
50,000 students at this university,
the Unite Party is only looking out
for about 5,200 of them, and it "can-
not let the Greek system down" be-
cause its "way of life" is at stake.
A woman in the Unite Party gave
a speech detailing what she thinks
the Student Alliance party wants
to do in Senate: ".These kids are
the kids that want to take down
the Greek system. They don't want
Sorority Row buses. They don't
want Fraternity Row buses. They
don't want parking privileges that
we have on Sorority Row where
you get your house parking. They
want everything gone for us. They
don't want us to live the life that we
have."
First of all, why is she whining
about bus routes and parking spots?
Last time I checked, the Student Al-
liance party's platform listed issues
that are infinitely more rational and
meaningful than that.
Second, Unite Party members ad-
mitted in the recording that the only
reason they want to be in Senate is
to push the Greek agenda.
These empty issues might be of
importance to the Unite Party, but
I don't think they are top priorities
for the 90 percent of UF studentsAida Bibart who are not
SpeakingOut Greek.
That same
Unite Party
person also said that "how we run
this campus is through passing bills
and getting certain things pushed
through, and we're not going to be
able to do that if half of their people
are in there and half of us, 'cause
then we do have to have them have
these bills passed that we don't
want that are going to hurt us."
Poor grammar aside, I'm trying
really hard to see what she could
mean by that.
I'm not involved in Student Gov-
ernment, so I'm no expert, but I'm
pretty sure that anything SG could
possibly do would not really have
that big of an impact on the Greek
community's beloved way of life,
so I fail to see how these delusional
ramblings are based on facts.
It's clear the Unite Party doesn't
represent my views or the views of
the other tens of thousands of stu-
dents here, and I'm tired of them
trying to spend my money on
dumb, frivolous ideas (i.e. $40,000
gym hand scanners) that are not
bettering anyone's experience at UF
except for the members of the Unite
Party.
They get to keep living the life
they have. Whatever that means.
P.S.: I wonder what the Unite
Party's new name will be next se-
mester after this latest scandal.
Aida Bibart is a UF student.

STUDENT LIFE
Student plays volleyball in buff
By STEFANIA FERRO
and LAUREN MARKS
Alligator Contributing Writers
One UF student left behind his clothes and his wor-
ries about tan lines when he headed to the Lake Como
Nudist Resort near Tampa for a nude volleyball tour-
nament at the beginning of Spring Break.
Daniel Phillips, the founder of Naturist Gators, a
group representing college-age nudists in Gainesville,
participated in the 9th annual Super Bowl South Vol-
leyball Tournament, held from March 4 to March 7.
Phillips was the only member of Naturist Gators
who attended the tournament, so he joined up with
the Pennsylvania-based Tiki Tomba volleyball team,
which won the tournament's novice division.
Phillips said the win was unexpected because it was
the first time the team practiced volleyball together.
Through Naturist Gators, Phillips does more than
attend volleyball tournaments.
He hopes to educate others about a naturist lifestyle
and wants to fix misconceptions about nudists.
"We are not exhibitionists," he said. "We only get
naked where it is legal and socially acceptable."
Eli Porr, a member of the Tiki Tomba team and a
communications senior at East Stroudsburg University
in Pennsylvania, was raised in a nudist colony.
He remembers playing volleyball, both with and
without clothing, since he could walk.Despite the nature of the game, players are allowed
to wear clothing, he said.
Porr has seen women wear sports bras and shorts
and men wear hats and shoes.
For Audra Kern, an English and communications
major at East Stroudsburg University and a member
of the Tiki-Tomba team, the tournament was her first
experience playing naked volleyball in Florida.
"We are not exhibitionists. We only get
naked where it is legal and socially ac-
ceptable."
Daniel Phillips
founder of Naturist Gators
She said volleyball is a good sport for nudists be-
cause it is mostly a noncontact sport.
Older generations of nudists are trying to encour-
age young adults to play naked volleyball, she said.
"The culture's dying out a bit, so they'd like to see
younger kids play," she said.
The Naturist Gators are working to organize other
nudist events.
Rachel Cohen, a UF marketing senior, said she has
mixed feeling about participating in a nude event.
"A UF event would probably be uncomfortable for
me, but if I were helping the community, I would be
more inclined to join in and strip down."

Ted Kellermann, Gainesville Regional Utilities Internet

Google's network because, like the country, it has a suburban
and rural mix.
Kellermann said it would cost Google about $1,500 per
home to install the new network throughout the

Web ing Gainesville because UF students and research-
ers will best utilize the service by developing new

Kellermann said local support would increase Gainesville's

The new network will have open access, allowing consum-
ers to choose from multiple providers like Cox, AT&T and

Gators land first NCAA Tournament bid since 2007
UF coach Billy Donovan and the 10th-seeded Gators will take on BYU on Thursday in Oklahoma City.
With a win, they'd face the winner of No. 2 Kansas State and No. 15 North Texas.By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer

After two disappointing sea-
sons and a long two-day wait,
Florida is back in the NCAA Tour-
nament.
The Gators (21-12, 9-7 South-
eastern Conference) will be in
the Tournament for the first time
since winning back-to-back na-
tional championships in 2006 and
2007. UF received a No. 10 seed
in the West Region and will play
seventh-seeded BYU in Oklahoma
City on Thursday.
If the Gators beat the Cougars
(29-5), they would face the winner
of No. 2 seed Kansas State vs. No.
15 seed North Texas.
"We're very, very excited, and
grateful for the opportunity," UF
coach Billy Donovan said in a
statement. "I'm most excited for
our players having a chance to
experience this. For most of them,
this is something they haven't
been through yet. They've worked
so hard from day one, and it's
great to see them rewarded.
"We'll get to work on BYU
right away. They come from a
great league, have a great pro-
gram, and it's a very difficult op-
ponent for us."Although Florida received a
No. 10 seed, the team entered Sun-
day night's selection process com-
pletely unsure whether it would
even make the field.
An early exit from the SEC Tour-
nament on Friday night, coupled
with several other bubble teams
performing well in their confer-
ence tournaments, had many ex-
perts projecting the Gators would
make a third straight National In-
vitation Tournament.
"I'm most excited for out
players having a chance to
experience this. For most
of them, this is something
they haven't been through
yet. ""
Billy Donovan
UF men's basketball coach
"It was a stressful 48 hours not
knowing if we were in or out,"
junior forward Chandler Parsons
said. "We're really excited to be a
part of it. For most of us it's our
first experience with the NCAA
Tournament. We don't just want
to go and play one game. We want
to prove we're deserving of being

W OWI had looked down andthought I needed to have my
hearing checked, and I'm pretty sure you
had a similar reaction.
Did I just hear "Florida" on the TV?
I flipped back 30 seconds on my DVR and
thought maybe I needed to have my eyes
checked, too.
The team everyone had pegged not to be
in the field of 65 made it. CBS later revealed
Florida was the fourth-to-last at-large pick.
The Gators didn't have to sweat too long
as they watched the selection special Sun-
day, getting picked as the No. 10 seed in the
second region announced.
UF will face seventh-seeded BYU on
Thursday with a possible second-round
matchup against No. 2 seed Kansas State.
Not that BYU will be an easy upset.
All five of the Cougars' losses came
against teams in the NCAA Tournament
field. They lead the Mountain West in scor-
ing (83 ppg) and three-point shooting (42> percent).BYU guard Jim-
mer Fredette aver-
ages more than 20
points per game and
shoots better thanPhil Kegler 45 percent from the

But today, you
should remember waking up on the right
side of the bubble and be a little more
grateful Billy Donovan stuck around in
Gainesville.
This season may have been one of Dono-
van's best coaching performances.
That may sound strange considering his
back-to-back national titles a few years back,
but those squads were some of the best col-
lege teams ever. I find it more impressive
when coaches get more out of less.
I wouldn't say Florida overachieved, be-

Behind seven individual All-American
performances, the UF men's track team
won the 2010 NCAA Indoor Champion-
ships in Fayetteville, Ark., this weekend.
It's the first indoor championship for
the program and the 23rd national cham-
pionship in school history.
"I'm extremely proud and very excited
about everyone in the program," coach
Mike Holloway said. "It's great to see hard
work come together, especially when it
comes together for a championship."
The women finished fourth, their best
since 2005, and had four All-Americans.
The men finished with 57 team points,
holding off Oregon and defending nation-
al champion Texas A&M, which both fin-ished with 44 points for second place. The
women scored 33 points, finishing behind
first-place Oregon, Tennessee and LSU.
Freshman Jeff Demps set a school re-
cord in the 60-meter dash preliminaries,
running a 6.56. He ran a 6.57 in the finals
to win the event and give
the Gators 10 team points.
Senior Jeremy Hall finished

Tony McQuay joinedTraCk Demps and Hall in win-

Charleston Southern hands No. 6 UF first home loss
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator org
Charleston Southern's cleanup
hitter beat Florida from the mound
instead of the batter's box Sunday.
Junior Tyler Thornburg, who hit
fourth in all three games against No.
6 UF (11-3), took the mound in the
third matchup and struck out 11 in a
complete-game effort while limiting
the Gators to a season-low three runs
and seven hits. The performance
took 158 pitches (101 strikes).
The right-hander baffled UF hit-
ters for most of the day, and the Buc-
caneers (6-10) were able to steal the
final game of the series and hand
the Gators their first home loss of
season by a score of 6-3 on Sunday.
"He was throwing all three
pitches (fastball, breaking ball and
changeup) for strikes," sophomore
Preston Tucker said. "He's got three
pitches that he's got good command
of, and he pitched really well."
Despite going deep into pitch
counts and running up Thornburg's
pitch count, the Gators couldn't
force the Buccaneers to use their
bullpen.
"We do that with most pitchers,
especially if it's a Sunday game and
the team has a blown-out bullpen,"
Tucker said of a CSU team that
threw out four bullpen pitchers Sat-
urday. "You just try to run the pitchcount up, but he stayed out there
and did real well."
Thornburg also helped give CSU
a 1-0 lead in the first with a sacrificefly to drive in Brantley Meier.
The Buccaneers scored two more
off sophomore pitcher Tommy To-
ledo in the third thanks to a two-runhomer from center fielder Jon Mat-
thews that curled just inside the left-
field foul pole to make it 3-0.
But things took a turn for the

neers' 6-3 win against Florida on Sunday. Thornburg also batted cleanup for CSU in the series.worse in the fourth when Toledo
was struck in the face by a come-
backer. He left the game and was
rushed to the hospital after lying
motionless for about three minutes.
A UF spokesman said Toledo
sustained facial fractures and a bro-
ken nose, and he was released from
Shands at UF on Sunday evening.
The Gators bounced back from
the incident in the bottom of the
inning, loading the bases with no
outs. Left fielder Tyler Thompson
hit a sacrifice fly to score one, but
the next two batters, Bryson Smith
and Kamm Washington, struck out
swinging to end the threat.
"It hurt a ton," Tucker said. "You
don't know how many opportuni-
ties you are going to have in a game,
and unfortunately that was one of
the few we got and we didn't cash
in."
Florida attempted to rally one
last time in the bottom of the ninth
with the score 6-2, but it was only
able to plate one run.
"He never gave us a chance to
get the tying run up to the plate," UF
coach Kevin O'Sullivan said. "That's
about as gutsy a performance as I've
seen in a long time."
The Gators won the first two
games 6-0 and 12-2, and they'll try to
bounce back from the loss Monday

No. 4 Gators take series with finale win against Rebels
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
After going just 3 for 14 with runners in
scoring position in Game 2, Florida got the
big hits right when it needed them Sunday.
Less than 24 hours after turning 22 base
runners into only four runs in a 6-4, extra-
inning loss, the No. 4 Gators (18-3, 2-1 South-
eastern Conference) were able to score five
runs on just four hits as they salvaged a home
series win with a 5-3 victory over Ole Miss
(16-10, 3-2 SEC).
Although UF matched its SEC loss totalfrom each of the last two seasons after just
three games, coach Tim Walton is still pleased
with his team's performance.
"Winning two out of three is a successful
weekend," Walton said. "It wasn't a goal of
ours to go undefeated, it was to take a series,
and we took a series today."
UF ace Stephanie Brombacher was unusu-
ally shaky Sunday, allowing the Rebels to
jump out to a 2-0 lead for the third-straight
game.
But, as was the case in the first two games,
Florida battled back in the bottom of the same
inning, this time scoring one on the first tripleof Megan Bush's career and then taking the
lead three batters later with a two-run homer
from Aja Paculba.
Bush also added a sac
fly in the third and an RBI
single in the fifth to give theElGators a 5-2 advantage.
The junior first baseman
is now 9 for 11 with three
home runs and 10 RBIs
Walton since March 7, when she
started a game on the bench for the first time
this season.
"It's always good to come back with awin after you lose," Bush said. "You want to
show that that pushed you and that it's really
fueling you for games to come."
After Brombacher gave up a leadoff home
run to start the sixth that cut the lead to
two, freshman Ensley Gammel came in and
capped off her great weekend by getting the
save and giving up just one hit over the final
two innings.
Gammel also got her first career SEC start
on Saturday and gave up just two runs over
five innings pitched.
The Gators took the series opener Friday,
12-2.

12-point losses to No. 1 seeds Syracuse

But the best thing about the NCAA
Tournament is the clean slate. Win six
games and you're the champ.
If Florida finds some consistent

Senior Calvin Smith ran the 400 in 46.60, fin-
ishing eighth, and ran the 200 in 20.67, good for
sixth place. Smith finished his UF career with
15 All-America titles, the most in school history
and one more than decathlete Mike Morrison.
McQuay and Smith joined Preston Wilson

Sophomore Christian Taylor defended

Omar Craddock, who joined the team in Jan-
uary, landed 16.15 meters in the triple jump to
place seventh and be named an All-American.
Kemal Mesic finished second in the shot put.
The junior threw 19.26 meters while earning histhird All-America title.
As expected, senior Mariam Kevkhishvili
won her third-straight indoor shot put title. Her
18.59 meter throw was a personal best and se-
cured her 13 straight event title.
Junior Charlotte Browning also earned All-
