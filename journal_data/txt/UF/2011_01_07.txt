ALBANY, Ga. — Police say a Georgia 
woman used a friend’s baby to collect more 
than $1,600 in child support from an ex-boy-friend after she convinced him the child was his.
Dougherty County Sheriff’s Capt. Craig 
Dodd says Regina Thompson’s ex-boyfriend paid the money over two years. 
Dodd says the ex-boyfriend even had pic-
tures made at the girl’s birthday party.
The 38-year-old Thompson has been charged with five counts of theft. 
Police say Thompson was keeping 
her friend’s child when she concocted the scheme.
The girl’s mother, Lastraga McCloud, 
didn’t know anything about the plot. 
Police say it began to unravel when the 
girl, now five, began to talk more and told Thompson’s ex-boyfriend, Joseph Golden, that he wasn’t her father.

Fe College. Huuda was found dead Dec. 30. Police are investigating her death as a homicide.
OBITUARY
By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER
Alligator Staff Writer
When Saleha Huuda showed 
up to try out for the UF Com-
petitive Cheerleading squad, her 
smile  immediately made an im-pression, and her skills as a flyer had her fellow cheerleaders fight-ing over who would be the one to 
catch her as she fell from the air. 
She loved cheerleading. 
She loved her dog, Vegaz. And most of all, she loved to 
dance.
“She had love for a lot of 
things, but dancing, cheering and animals, that was her main thing,” said Ndyanao Horne, 
who knew Huuda since age 12 
and considered her to be fam-ily. “That’s what she was really about.”
Huuda was found dead Dec. 
30 after firefighters extinguished a brushfire off of county Road 
225, a half-mile north of the 
Gainesville Raceway. She was 21. 
The Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Office has been investigating the death as a homicide, and expects 
that the medical examiner will 
conclude that Huuda was mur -
dered, according to Art Forgey, public information officer for the 
Sheriff’s Office. 
To date, no suspects have been 
named in Huuda’s death.
“We were very close,” Horne 
said. “Words can’t describe [their 
relationship], especially for how long I’ve known her, especially for the things that we’ve been 
through and the things that we’ve 
done.”
She remembers bringing her 
dog, Bubby, to play with Vegaz, and watching movies rented from Redbox, which Huuda would let Student remembered for smile, kindness

Senior Vice President for Administration 
and Business V entures Brian Beach is leaving 
his post after six years., according to an e-mail sent to administrators Thursday afternoon.
UF President Bernie Machen said Beach is 
leaving to return to the private sector. His last day is Jan. 25.
Machen spoke highly of Beach in the mes-
sage.
“An intensely focused and skilled manager, 
he directed changes in our budget and finan-cial operations that position UF for the future,” he said.
Beach also served as Machen’s chief of staff 
before assuming his most recent position in 2008.
He was instrumental in the development 
of the plan for Innovation Square, a 1 million square-foot development along Southwest Second Avenue that will feature retail, residen-
tial and restaurant space, and will house UF 
research geared toward incubating local busi-ness and creating jobs.
According to the e-mail, Beach’s duties will 
be distributed among current administra-tors. Ed Poppell, vice president for admin-
istrative affiars, will become vice president for 
business affairs and economic development. 
Former Student Body President Jamal Sowell, who recently took a position as an assistant to Machen, will work as a liaison to the Board of Trustees.UF vice president resigns

City Commission praises 
mentoring program
The Gainesville Enrichment 
Mentoring Program was rec-
ognized at a Gainesville City 
Commission meeting Thursday 
as an exceptional program to help students be the best they can be.
“In our community, we have 
some students who have a great deal of potential, but who may face challenges,” said Mayor Craig Lowe, who has a men-
tee at Howard Bishop Middle 
School.
The mentors help their men-
tees overcome those roadblocks 
with encouragement and ad-
vice.
Cecil Howard, director of the 
Office of Equal Opportunity, said it makes a difference when a student hears “You can do it,” and “I believe in you.”
“They get to the point when 
they don’t want to disappoint you,” Howard said.
Timothy Miles, a seventh-
grader at Abraham Lincoln Middle School, said he likes to be challenged, and he has con-
crete goals. 
But he said he has some bad 
habits, like not turning in his 
homework on time. He said his 
mentor, Commissioner Scher -
win Henry, encourages him of-
ten to change those habits.
“It’s pretty strong,” Miles 
said about how much his men-
tor encourages him.

On a chilly Thursday evening on Bo Diddley Plaza, 
homeless men and women lined up to get their meal 
for the day . 
This homeless feed, however, was technically illegal 
according to a city ordinance that states that the num-
ber of meals served in a 24-hour period is not to exceed 
130, except on Thanksgiving, Christmas and one other holiday designated by the food distribution center.
 The feed was set up by a local coalition as a demon-
stration to protest the ordinance.
“Communities aim to control and regulate the con-
ditions and behaviors of the homeless when the focus should be on creating housing and jobs,”  said Neil Donovan, the Executive Director and CEO of the Na-
tional Coalition for the Homeless. “Communities are 
only going to change when problems are brought to the light of day.”
Elijah Wood, a homeless man who counts on home-
less feeds has been negatively affected by the meal limit. 
“It’s not right. It seems like organizations have the 
food, but once they serve 130 people, they have to stop. And the food just sits there,” Wood said. “If people are willing to donate and help the homeless, then they should be able to do it.”Coalition protests meal limit

A recent survey shows that Floridians still lacked financial 
confidence in December, a trend that did not change from the 
month prior. 
The consumer confidence survey, conducted by UF’s Survey 
Research Center at the UF Bureau of Economic and Business Re-search, showed that while many Floridians are optimistic about the next five years financially, they are not as confident about the upcoming year compared to how they felt in November.
Chris McCarty, director of UF’s Survey Research Center, 
said the number stayed steady at 71 and that the economy still 
needs to grow.
“People not buying things is an issue,” he 
said.
McCarty  said while 71 isn’t a bad number, it 
isn’t great either. 
“50 says: we’re in a recession,” he said. “But 90 to 100, we’re 
doing great.”
The lowest Florida’s consumer confidence has ever hit was 
57 in June 2008 in the aftermath of the housing-bubble burst the year prior. UF economics professor Dave Denslow said that that kind of thing affects the data when people answer the questions.
“It can vary depending on what people see on the news,” 
he said.Consumers doubt

A team of researchers at UF, 
the University of South Florida 
and the University of California, San Diego were awarded $4.7 million by the National Institutes of Health to study the effects of 
marijuana use on youths with 
HIV infection.
According to a UF press re-

ing at how substance abuse 
changes immune function and 
the progression of HIV infection in the brain. “Findings from this study 
could translate into better diag-nosis tools and new therapies to improve long-term outcomes for young adults infected with HIV ,” said principal investigator Mau-reen Goodenow, a UF College of Medicine professor.

Grinning widely, Ralph Lowenstein stood in front of 
colleagues, friends and loved ones, many of them smiling 
back, as he stood by the monument bearing his visage and 
his prophecy.
“Print on paper is dead.”The monument is one of the features of the 21st Cen-
tury News Laboratory, a newsroom outfitted to host UF 
journalism students of all disciplines — print, television, 
radio and online. The lab opened in late September.
Behind the technical impressiveness of the lab, deep in 
the history of Weimer Hall, lie the ideas of Lowenstein. 
His tenure as dean of the College of Journalism and Com-
munications was marked by a continuous push for inno-vation. He oversaw the construction of Weimer Hall and brought the first computers to the college.
But apart from parlaying a career in journalism into 
a life as a dean of UF’s journalism college, Lowenstein has dedicated time to the remembrance of the about 1,300 American and Canadian Jews who traveled to Israel in 1948 to fight in its War of Independence.
At the age of 18, he was one of them.He collected more than 500 individual files, 2,000 pho-
tos and hundreds of interviews, memoirs, and audio and video tapes.
The American Jewish Historical Society announced 
Thursday it is awarding Lowenstein its highest award, the Emma Lazarus Statue of Liberty. The award, accord-ing to a release from the organization, is given to “an in-dividual who has demonstrated outstanding leadership 
and commitment to strengthening the American Jewish 
community.”
Lowenstein said he did not expect such recognition.“It’s sort of like winning the lottery without buying a 
ticket,” he said.
He will receive the award at a May 4 ceremony in New 
York City. 
The monument in Weimer Hall, standing about five 
feet tall and displaying a brief professional biography of Lowenstein, stands as a testament to the vision of a man who is always looking forward but never forgets to look back.
n n n
Lowenstein arrived at UF in 1976. It was then, as the new 
dean of the College of Journalism and Communications, that 
he made the statement declaring the death of print on pa-
per. 
Reporters mocked him, editors were mildly interested, 
and his contemporaries at other schools lampooned his vi-sion.
He knew that to most, it sounded like a joke, an outland-
ish theory. But he didn’t care.
“I wasn’t insulted. I thought it was funny because I’ve 
always felt that if people are that stupid, it gives me a better 
chance, you know?” he said.
“I was so confident that I was right.”
He had developed his idea during his years of studying 
communication at the University of Missouri. Inspiration came from the British Broadcasting Corporation’s Ceefax, a 
service started in 1974 after BBC engineers wanted to de-
velop a way to deliver captions for deaf people watching television.
Part of it was also just Lowenstein’s common sense.“It’s just so logical — print on paper is such a wasteful 
means of distribution,” he said.
By 1982, he had pushed to bring the first computers to 
the college. 
Two years later, he founded Gainesville Cable Press, a 
Ceefax-like service that was run by students and updated 18 hours a day.
Even in the time leading up to his retirement in 1994, he 
pushed for the college to help jump-start the The Gainesville Sun’s online presence: SunOne.com.
Given his accomplishments, Lowenstein still won’t fully 
accept the title of a visionary. 
His day-to-day life is modest. As dean emeritus, he comes 
to work early in the morning, spends a lot of time with his wife, Bronia, and plays tennis on Sunday mornings.
From time to time, he’ll visit a Jewish cemetery at the 
edge of town, where he’s reminded of a part of his identity 
that he holds dearly.
n n n
When Lowenstein traveled to Europe in the summer of 
1948, it was to spend six weeks working on English farms 
that had been left shorthanded after the war. 
The trip was part of a summer exchange program for stu-
dents. After the month, he would spend some time touring 
Europe alone before returning home.
That was what his mother and father believed. It was 
what Columbia University, where he had just finished his 
freshman year, had arranged. To his brothers, it was all the 18-year-old Jewish boy from Danville, Va., wanted to do.
The Arab-Israeli War, known by Jews as the War of Inde-
pendence, had just begun, gripping the newly formed na-tion. The students’ passports were stamped “not valid for travel to a foreign country.” The U.S. did not want American 
Jews to volunteer in a foreign army.
He finished his work on the farms and found his way to 
Paris, where he set out to look for the newly formed Israeli 
embassy.
Knowing no French, he looked through a phone book for 
“Juif”, or Jew. He found one listing — a kosher butcher — and went to it.
The butcher understood English and told him how to get 
to the embassy, which Lowenstein said was barely up and 
running.
“When I got there, they were still nailing up the walls,” he said. 
He told the secretary that we wanted to volunteer in the 
Israeli Army.
Without a word, she gave him a thin slip of paper with 
an address. 
From there, Lowenstein went to a small studio apartment, 
where he met the men who would smuggle him to Israel.
They had three different Jewish doctors examine him, and 
they took away his passport and gave him fake papers. He 
spent two weeks in displaced-persons camps in Marseilles before being shipped out.
Ten days after evading the eyes of UN observers and be-
ing smuggled into Israel, Lowenstein was behind the wheel 
of a half-track during battle.
He had no military experience. He had no basic training. 
He could drive, and he was willing to risk everything.
“I was willing to give my life,” he said.He finds it funny now when people ask him if he was 
afraid of losing his U.S. citizenship.
“If you decide that something’s worth losing your life 
over, truthfully, citizenship is second.”
n n n
Lowenstein finds peace through beautifying the Jewish 
cemetery at the corner of University Avenue and Waldo Road.
Walking slowly along the concrete path, he thinks out 
loud about the password for the lock posted at the entrance 
gate. Posted is a Hebrew word, repeated: “chai chai.” It is 
the Hebrew word for “life.” 
“Ironic for a cemetery,” he said. ”Everybody’s dead.”
He spearheaded the project to build a Holocaust memo -
rial there, a memorial he designed. It stands about 6 feet tall, with a blue Star of David painted on the top. One-third of 
the star has been chipped away, a way Lowenstein devised 
to remind those of the number of Jews killed during the Ho-locaust.
He looks silently at the inscription on the side of the mon-
ument, which reads:
“To them I will give in my house and within My walls a 
memorial And a name better than that of sons and daugh-ters; I will give them an everlasting name which will not be cut off.” - Isaiah 56:5
“It’s not really a memorial,” Lowenstein said. “It’s tomb-
stone for 6 million men, women and children.”4, ALLIGATOR n FRIDAY, JANUARY 7, 2011

A joint investigation of local cab 
companies by Gainesville and Uni-
versity Police revealed that many 
cab drivers have been operating 
against city ordinances to over -
charge customers, adding hard evi-
dence to a long list of complaints of 
unfair practices.
The operation was launched 
in late fall in response to ongoing 
complaints from UF students that 
drivers were overcharging them for 
non-metered rides, according to a 
UPD press release.
UPD and GPD worked under -
cover with members of UF Student Government, and on two separate 
nights last semester, took rides from random companies all over the city.
Out of 19 fares, 11 were found 
in violation of City Ordinance 28, 
which requires cab drivers to use 
their meters for paying customers. 
The punishment for breaking the 
ordinance is a $50 fine.
“We’ve heard numerous times that drivers were taking advantage of students,” said Jillian Rogers, the SG liaison to UPD. “It’s always been an issue, but until now, no one could do anything about it.”
The results of the investigation, 
as well as ideas to curb the prob-lem, will be open for discussion in a combined Student Senate and 
Gainesville City Commission meet-
ing, open to the public on Jan. 18 at 
7 p.m., in the Reitz Union Audito-
rium.
“It’s great that UPD, GPD and 
SG are working together to fix this problem,” Rogers said. “This is the only way right now and we’re tak-ing positive steps to protect students in the future.”FRIDAY, JANUARY 7, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 5

n EVAN FERDERBER IS CHARGED 
WITH TWO FELONIES.
By KAT BEIN
Alligator Staff Writer
A 21-year-old man was arrested Thurs-
day morning and charged with two felo-
nies for pistol-whipping a man on the side of the road earlier in the night.
At about 2:35 a.m., Evan Ferderber, 
whose address was listed as 370 Palmdale 
Drive in Oldsmar, was standing with an-other man and a woman on the 300 block of Northwest 18th Street. 
A car of four pulled over after recog-
nizing one of the three people on the side of the road, according to Gainesville Po-lice spokeswoman Tscharna Senn, to see 
whether the group Ferderber was with 
needed any help.
Although his motive re-
mains unknown, Ferderber 
eventually pulled out a hand-
gun and pointed it at one of the men, Dan-iel Mascarel. 
However, instead of shooting Mascarel, he smacked the gun against his head, cut-ting him behind his left ear, Senn said.
Ferderber ran away and eluded police 
until about 10:30 a.m. when he was found in possession of the gun. 
He was taken to the Alachua County 
Jail and is charged with one count of ag-gravated assault and one count of aggra-
vated battery, she said.Police arrest man after pistol-whipping in NW Gainesville“We’ve heard

Today’s question: Are you ready for Spring Break yet? 
337 TOTAL VOTESThursday’s question: Should the “N-word” be removed from “Huckleberry Finn”? 3% YES97% NOGuest column
Gentle giants deserve concern, help
In 2010, 767 manatees were documented to have died 
or been killed in Florida. 
A significant number of the manatee deaths re-
sulted from the prolonged cold temperatures last win-ter. 
These numbers are an all-time high, shat-
tering the previous record of 429 set in 2009.  
Last week, I watched a manatee barrel roll down the spring run at Blue Spring, on the St. Johns River. 
The rising late-morning temperatures and shining 
sun made it safer for manatees to venture into the cold river to feed.
This week, at Three Sisters Spring, on Florida’s 
west coast, I observed manatees huddled in discretely marked sanctuaries. 
They sat motionless for hours, resting and conserv-
ing energy beyond the reach of human visitors.
Nearly every manatee I saw was scarred from previ-
ous boat collisions.
The Blue Spring manatee had a series of four propel-
ler scars down the left side of his body, suggesting he 
may have been trying to roll away from the oncoming 
boat that struck him and left him permanently scarred. 
One of the manatees that swam so gracefully up the 
spring run at Three Sisters Spring to get even closer to 
the warm water boiling from the spring, had the ap-
pearance of a mermaid. 
Her paddle-shaped tail had been mutilat-
ed into a fork shape, again by a boat collision.  
I often think about what it was like to be a manatee in 
Florida 100 years ago — how much different life was for 
them — how much quieter it was. 
To say that they have had to undergo a steep learn-ing curve to adapt to our ditching, diking, and draining of Florida, not to mention the construction 
of mega-marinas, seawalls, 
ports, and docks that have resulted from Florida’s 
growth, would be the understatement of the century.  
Save the Manatee Club is celebrating its 30th Anniver -
sary in 2011. 
For these last 30 years, this organization has been the 
voice of manatees. 
While groups like the club and federal and state 
agencies have taken great strides to protect manatees, 
it isn’t enough. 
All I could think about as I watched the barrel-rolling 
manatee and his counterpart with the mermaid tail in 
Crystal River was how these manatees need our voices 
now more than ever before. 
We need to protect their warm-water habitat from 
aquifer over-pumping and nutrient pollution. 
We need to safeguard sea grass beds from propeller 
scarring and oil spills. 
We need to educate boaters so that fewer manatees 
suffer from boat collisions that leave them mutilated or 
dead. 
Most of all, we need to teach all of Florida’s residents 
and visitors that our daily actions affect this species, even if we don’t directly cross paths. 
As we look ahead to the next 30 years, there’s no 
doubt that manatees will continue to need support from strong, caring voices to ensure their survival. 
We’ll be here for them. Will you? Katie Tripp is the director of science and conservation for 
Save the Manatee Club
Welcome back, everyone. If you’re like us, you turned 
your brain off during the break and tried to forget about 
classes and grades. Now, everyone’s got to hit the ground 
running for the spring semester marathon. We’ve got some 
catching up to do in the remind-us-why-we-go-to-class-during-drop/add-again edition of...
Darts & Laurels 
Because it only took three days for us to start searching 
the calendar for Spring Break.
If the first day of the semester is normally a headache, 
Wednesday was a migraine.
For paralyzing our class shopping spree and gener -
ally freaking us out, we’re throwing an if-we-don’t-get-the-last-seat-in-that-class-we-need-we’re-going-to-lose-it 
DART at UF’s Shibboleth Authentication System. We 
aren’t used to Webmail, ISIS and Sakai failing us in our 
time of need.
Our politicians, however, are a different story.The hemming and hawing lawmakers practice seems 
like second nature to them. So we’re giving a surprising perhaps-continual-layoffs-would-keep-you-on-your-toes LAUREL to the lame-duck session of Congress.
During last month’s race to the finish of the 112th Con-
gress, the folks in Washington addressed tax cuts, the mili-tary’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, a new START treaty and the Sept. 11 first responders health bill. No matter where you stand on the political spectrum, the glimmer of legislative efficiency looks enticing. We’re not advocating 
passing laws without due consideration, we just like the 
thought of our lawmakers doing what their title implies.
You should be worried now that we’ve seen what you 
can do, Congress.
Of course, the balance of power changed while we were 
on break. For exchanging her seat in such an awkward manner, we’re throwing a we’ll-never-look-at-a-gavel-the-same-way DART to former Speaker of the House Nancy 
Pelosi.
New Speaker of the House John Boehner set the mi-
nority leader up for an overcompensation joke when he chose an oversized gavel for the exchange of power. Pelosi couldn’t help herself, and we started the new Congressio-
nal session with a groan.
Maybe we can look forward to “that’s what she said” 
jokes down the road. Someone might actually watch C-
SPAN for that.
Congressional comedy hour isn’t the only thing we’re 
shaking our heads at. We feel like we’ve gone through every season in the past month, and we’re wondering if Mother Nature is concocting a new one just for us. For making Floridians run back to our apartments for coats or 
umbrellas, we’re throwing an every-day-is-an-adventure-
through-our-closet DART to the weather.
Just pick a temperature already.The skies were clear in Tampa for New Year’s Day, 
though. We had nothing obscuring our view of the Gators’ 
37-24 win over Penn State.
For sending Urban Meyer out in style, we’re tossing 
we-knew-you’d-make-it-worthwhile-to-wake-up-after-that-crazy-New-Year’s-Eve-party LAURELS onto the hel-
mets of the UF football team.
And have an extra LAUREL on us, coach. Thanks for 
the six years of excitement.
That’s all for this week, Gators. Catch you next time.Katie Tripp
Speaking OutFRIDAY, JANUARY 7, 2011 n  ALLIGATOR, 7
Earlier this week New York Times columnist Ross 
Douthat’s piece “The Unborn Paradox” sparked a fierce online comment war over the concept of abortion. Both 
sides of the debate were vehemently championed.
The pro-choice camp defended their position loudly , but 
most of their arguments seemed like poor excuses for the ter -
mination of what would otherwise become a human being.
The most basic tenet of the pro-choice movement is that 
women have the right to do whatever they want with their bodies, and any restrictions on abortion are nothing more than men trying to oppress women (never mind the number of fe-male pro-lifers).
Maybe it would be more apt to call it the “anti-consequence” 
movement. Women who protest that they must be given the 
right to choose forget they already did choose: they chose to 
gamble, to risk the possibility of pregnancy. What they really want is the “choice” to forfeit all respon-sibility should they lose the bet.
Unfortunately , there is something 
much more important than money at 
stake. Those who support abortion would have potential moth-
ers believe their unborn baby is nothing more than a ball of 
cells, rendering the procedure no more repulsive than remov-ing a tumor or a parasite. Technically, a fetus is just a bunch of cells. But so are we. 
Pro-choice proponents often argue abortion exists to save 
children from growing up in ignorant poverty and teenage girls from throwing away their potential. However, the facts show  the widespread assumption that most people who get 
abortions are underprivileged teens is completely false.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2005 only 16.8 per -
cent of abortions were performed on those under 20. Slightly more abortions were performed on married women. It is hard-er to make abortion sound noble when it is saving working women from inconvenience instead of tragically uneducated girls from poverty.
Even if a woman is not in the position to raise a baby, adop-
tion is a viable, even preferable, middle ground. 
There are some very rare exceptions when abortion may 
be acceptable, such as cases of rape or danger to the mother. 
However, for the most part abortion-as-birth-control is morally 
repugnant, and any lessening of the current one-in-five-preg-nancies rate would be a victory.
Whether abortion is legal or illegal, socially acceptable or 
taboo, it will never be morally justifiable. We are free to choose our actions, but then we must accept responsibility for the con-sequences.

UWireDear freshmen,
I hear you’re try-
ing to decide on a college.  
Well, you’ve probably heard that there are 
three parts to college: studying, socializing 
and sleeping.
We can have two, but none of us can have 
all three.
Let me help you plan your choices.  
If you want to study and sleep, then join the 
Fisher School of Accounting. Only 12 percent of grades in this college are A’s or A-’s.
Or, to put it another way, the accounting 
school gives, per student, fewer than a sixth 
of the A’s that the education college gives.  
In other words, it gives fewer than a fourth of the A’s given on average at 
UF — 51 percent of the grades are A’s.  
But, I hear accountants make a lot of money.  
Speaking of the College of Education, 78 per -
cent of the grades earned in this college are A’s or A-’s. 
This means if you’re an average student, 
then you will get eight A’s for every 10 classes 
you take. The average GPA for courses in the 
education college is a 3.63.
The highest GPA for any college is the Col-
lege of Public Health and Health Professions at a 3.64.
You see the trade-off? In college, you get a higher GPA. When 
you graduate, you get a lower salary.  And when you meet recruiters who are trying to convince you to sign your life away for a free Army , 
Navy or Air Force T-
shirt, remember one thing. 
The lowest 
grade point aver -
age per grade of any college is the Division of Military Science at 2.20, or a C average.  
And maybe those premed students can start letting up on nursing majors. 
The College of Nursing has a 2.31 GPA, 
while the two colleges that house most pre-med students — the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences — both have an average GPA higher than 3.2.. 
Well, does that mean the college is hard-
er or that the students are not as smart?  
If I wanted to go into some medical profession, I’d get a degree in the public health college. 
But that’s just me.I like taking the easy route.  
I’m not saying this means anything about how hard each college is, but if you want to keep Bright Futures, then maybe you should reconsider if you want to be an accountant or a school teacher.

Two former members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon Fraternity were arrested Dec. 14 on charges of stealing a 
rocking chair from Delta Tau Delta fraternity. The charges were dropped against the two men.
The two fraternities that were robbed decided not to press charges
The two men were arrested 
and charged with burglary and 
theft, and the stolen items were 
returned.
Delta Tau Delta and Delta Up-
silon declined to press charges, 
so the charges were dropped.
“Delta Tau Delta considers 
this matter closed,” said Adam 
Tagliero, the Delta Tau Delta 
president. “We have not pressed any charges and all the damages 
have been paid for.”
Police estimated the stolen 
rocking chair to be worth about $150.
The value of the the stolen portrait was estimated to be at 
least $75.Interfraternity Council Presi-
dent Rajiv Ansani said the coun-cil would take no disciplinary ac-tion against Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
or the two men since they were 
no longer affiliated with the fra-ternity at the time the robberies occurred.
“It seems pretty clear from our 
perspective that these individu-als were acting not under the ac-tions of the fraternity but of their own accord,” Ansani said.
Both Hostutler and Lanoue 
were removed from Sigma Alpha Epsilon last semester during the fraternity’s reorganization.
Had the two men still have 
been part of their fraternity, An-sani said it would have been a “Greek conduct matter” and the council would have to had to 
have started a judicial process to 
determine the consequences.
Weber said Sigma Alpha Ep-
silon President Marcus Motes personally apologized for the 
robbery.
Motes is arranging for Hostut-
ler and Lanoue to apologize as 
well.FRAT , from page 1A candlelight vigil will be held at 7 p.m. Saturday at the Reitz Union
sit as she racked up large late fees.
She remembers the multitude of ani-
mals Huuda kept around.
In addition to Vegaz, she had fish, mice 
and a snake.
“She had a little mini-zoo in her apart-
ment,” Horne said.
And she remembers her friend Saleha, 
the outgoing, cheerful woman who loved 
to dance.
“She really loved people,” Horne said. 
“She was really welcoming. She made peo-
ple feel comfortable around her. She was a 
joy to be around.”But Huuda had her serious side, as fel-
low cheerleaders remember her as a hard worker who would let nothing get in the way of her and a good performance. 
“I thought she was an awesome flyer,” 
said Karen Richards, who was the person catching Huuda on her way down. “She was so tight. She knew exactly what she was doing.” 
Richards remembered Huuda for her 
toughness as well, when she performed even with an injury. Despite urges from her squad to take it easy, Huuda would 
shed her sling and continue working.
“You always want to work with some-
body that you know is trying their best and trying their hardest,” Richards said. 
“And she was that type of person.” 
Richards also took note of Huuda’s 
love for dancing. Whenever the cheer team 
would go out together, Huuda could al-
ways be found on the dance floor. 
“She’d dance to anything,” she said. 
Even on a beach trip over 
spring break, Huuda was on 
the shores of Panama City 
Beach, dancing to nothing, 
just to dance. 
“She was just always living for the mo-
ment,” Richards said. 
A memorial service was held for Huuda 
Thursday afternoon, and Richards said ev-eryone spoke highly of her — her person-ality and her smile. 
Though she attended the memorial ser -
vice, accepting Huuda’s death has been 
difficult for Richards.
“There’s no way something like that 
could’ve happened to her,” she said. “She 
was way too good of a person for that to happen.”
A candlelight vigil has been set for 7 
p.m. Saturday in the Reitz Union Amphi-theater.
Anyone with information about Huuda 
is urged to call Crime Stoppers at 352-372-STOP or the Alachua County Sheriff’s Of-fice at 352-955-1818.OBIT , from page 1

There is an old axiom that says, 
“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try 
again.”
And when an attempt usually 
converts less than 50 percent of the time — as with a shot in basketball 
— the ability to earn second chances 
can be of paramount importance. 
Florida (11-3) appears to have 
taken that message to heart, as the Gators have established dominance 
on the offensive glass and will need to continue that trend if they want to earn a victory over Ole Miss (12-3) Saturday at 8 p.m. in the O’Connell 
Center. 
So far this season, the Gators 
have grabbed 42.8 percent of their 
offensive rebounding opportunities, a number that ranks them fifth na-tionally , according to Kenpom.com. 
This means that every time a UF 
shot misses, there is a 42.8 percent chance the Gators will come down 
with it. 
“I think with our size and our 
depth, it really allows us to get to the 
backboard,” senior forward Chan-dler Parsons said. “We’ve got guys 
flying in there every game.”
Florida’s willingness to crash the glass offensively has played a major role in overcoming its streaky three-
point shooting. 
The Gators have discovered that 
a missed shot does not always mean 
the end of a scoring opportunity , as 
they have put up 184 second-chance points this season. 
Many of those come from senior 
center V ernon Macklin, who leads 
the team in offensive boards with 
39 and poured in a career-high 22 points when he squared off against Ole Miss a season ago. 
“After the first seven or eight 
points, the rest came off of offensive rebounds or if there was penetra-
tion,” coach Billy Donovan said. 
Against a Southeastern Confer -
ence frontcourt with the physicality 
of Mississippi, the Gators will need to get contributions from bench play-ers like Will Yeguete, Patric Young 
and Casey Prather if they wish to

n THE TIGERS GRABBED 34 
BOARDS TO THE GATORS’ 25.

Alligator Writer
 
The Gators traveled to Auburn in 
search of their first road victory of the 
season. But they left empty handed, beaten at their own game. 
The Tigers (9-6, 2-0 Southeastern 
Conference) dominated the action in the paint Thursday, creating easy looks and frequent trips to the free-throw line while dismantling Florida (11-5, 1-1 SEC) 73-56 in the first con-ference game played in Auburn’s new arena.
For only the second time this sea-
son, UF was outrebounded by its op-ponent. 
Auburn’s 34-25 advantage on the 
glass created multiple second-chance 
opportunities that helped turn a close 
game into a rout.
“They won the paint, there’s not 
any question,” coach Amanda Butler said. “It’s disappointing. That was our emphasis, especially in [Wednes-day’s] practice, that we must win the paint, and we didn’t.”
In addition to the advantage in re-
bounding, Auburn added 18 points in the paint and 14 second-chance Auburn controls

Ten years ago, I stopped watching foot-
ball. 
The NFL playoffs kick off this week. 
This used to be my favorite time of year. I’d hang on every play as the top two teams made their runs to the Super Bowl, living and dying on every down.
When I was a kid in New York, I’d root for 
the Giants. But later in life, the only team that interested me was the green team, and I don’t mean the Jets — I mean cash.
If I didn’t bet $5,000 on a game, it was like 
watching paint dry.  
Some plays still haunt me:  Franco Har -
ris’ “Immaculate Reception”; “The Catch,” where Joe Montana hit Dwight Clark with 51 seconds left to beat Dallas in the 1982 NFC Championship Game; Philadelphia’s Chuck Bednarik’s crushing hit on the Giants’ Frank Gifford in 1960.  
But I lost my love for football when gam-
bling became my new mistress. Her action, her juice, her rush proved too hard to resist. 
I suppose my compulsion started in the 
‘50s when I was a kid growing up in the Bronx streets. There, my friends and I played poker for 2 to 5 cents a card. We’d flip base-ball cards, play black-jack for pennies, play stickball for quarters. We gambled on ev-erything. 
After joining the 
service, I found that by reading a few books on poker, mem-
orizing rudimentary mathematical odds and developing minimal card sense, I could make a lucrative living. 
In 1966, the poker craze hadn’t hit yet. 
You didn’t have to be a great player to make money — just a good one. Most money won playing poker comes not from the brilliance of your own play, but from your opponent’s ineptitudes. 
The following year, 1967, I went to Viet-
nam. Playing poker in Southeast Asia was like stealing. Due to tax exemptions and com-bat pay, soldiers had a lot of money. I tried to

GATORS AND CORNHUSKERS STARTS AT 7 P.M.

Alligator Writer
 
A glittering sign that reads, “what are U 
made oF?” dangles in the Ted Crom Gym-
nastics Studio, just above the countdown 
clock for tonight’s meet against No. 10 Ne-
braska.
“The team comes up with their slogan in 
the fall, and that was something that they 
really were excited about,” Florida coach 
Rhonda Faehn said. “To get everyone on 
board and have the same passion, the same 
heart, the same work ethic and to really 
prove to one another — and to everyone else 
out there — that no one will outwork them. They’re going to show really what they’re made of.”
The team’s mantra will be spilled onto 
the mats tonight at 7 as the No. 3 Gators 
open their season against the Cornhuskers 
in the O’Connell Center. 
Before Faehn began her reign as a coach 
at UF, she was an assistant coach for Nebras-ka, as was current Gators assistant coach 
Adrian Burde. At last year’s NCAA Cham-
pionships, Nebraska finished seventh while 
the Gators came in fifth place. 
“They’re a great gymnastics program, his-
torically, and are very strong,” Faehn said. “We’re looking forward to probably some of the best gymnastics that’s going to be in the 
O’Dome throughout the season. Nebraska is 
going to be a very strong competitor.”
Though tonight’s meet will be the squad’s 
first of the season, the women were exposed 
to competition format nearly a month ago in an intrasquad meet on Dec. 9. 
“This intrasquad was better than the 
year’s past, which was good to see because our workout habits were a little bit different 
this season,” senior Maranda Smith said. 
“We put our routines together earlier, so 
that jump-started us to being more prepared 
for that first competition than we were last 
year. 
“We went into that 
first meet last year still 
kind of thinking too 
much about our routines rather than just letting it 
happen and being able 
to show what Rhonda says, the ‘polish and 
detail.’” 
Faehn said the meet allowed for con-
structive criticism and also got rid of any 
preseason butterflies.
“I got all the nervous jitters out,” sopho-more Ashanée Dickerson said. “It gets you back into routine mode to show off in front of the crowd.” 
The 2010 Southeastern Conference cham-
pion Gators return five All-Americans this 
season and added four freshmen — includ-ing Mackenzie Caquatto and Alaina Johnson, 
who have never been to a college gymnas-
tics meet, Dickerson said, and will be getting 
their first taste tonight. Although the team 
only carries two seniors this season, Smith said that leadership has been anything but 
lacking. 
“Every year the leadership roles change, 
and I really feel this year a lot of the girls 
have just stepped up in different ways than last,” Smith said. “It’s good to see that it’s 
not just dependent on the seniors of being 
leaders. Now, it’s where everyone can be, 
whether you are a sophomore or a fresh-
man.”UF to open season with home meet vs. Nebraska

will open at 1:30 p.m., and admis -
sion to the dual meet is free.
The Gators have been out of 
the pool since Dec. 3-5, when each 
team took a second-place finish at 
the 2010 Big Al Open at DeNunzio Pool despite less than half of each roster making the trip to Princeton, N.J. Freshman Ellese Zalewski had 
a breakout performance, making 
her first four career NCAA cuts.
The Yellow Jackets, meanwhile, 
have not competed since Nov. 19-
21 at the Georgia Tech Fall Invita-tional. UF was also at that meet, as the men took second with 1,121 
points (673 more than GT) and the 
women finished 
third with 939 
points (659 more 
than the Yellow Jackets).
Florida’s men 
own the top times 
in the Southeast-
ern Conference 
in the 200-yard freestyle (1:34.70), 1,000 free (9:00.48), 200 individual 
medley (1:45.52), 400 IM (3:45.21) and 800 free relay (6:31.74). Those five times, along with the Gators’ 
400 free relay time of 2:57.58, are in the top 10 nationally. Senior Conor Dwyer, last season’s NCAA and 
SEC Male Swimmer of the Year, 
leads the men’s squad, having re-corded NCAA-best times in the 1,000 free and 400 IM while becom-ing the first swimmer in UF history 
to be named SEC Male Swimmer of 
the Week three times in the same season. 
The women have two top 
times in the SEC — the 200-yard backstroke (1:54.27) and 400 IM 
(4:06.84) — and the highest scores 
in the 1-meter and platform div-ing competitions. Freshman Eliza-beth Beisel has led the Gators  this 
season, taking home SEC Female 
Swimmer of the Week honors three times this season.
Today’s meet will mark a first 
for Florida’s women’s squad, as 
the Gators and Yellow Jackets have 
never faced off before. The men, on the other hand, competed on Oct. 23, 2009, when UF beat Georgia 
Tech 161-123 in Atlanta.

Forward Murphy to sit out Saturday’s game with mid-foot sprain
pull off a repeat performance. 
  Despite playing limited minutes, the 
freshmen have been an effective per diem 
source of rebounds all season, including 
last week’s 71-67 win over Xavier. 
  “Those guys just come at you in 
waves,” Musketeers coach Chris Mack 
said of Florida’s frontcourt. “They can re-
ally offensive rebound the ball. Certainly Tyus and Macklin are a lot more skilled at this point in time than the young kids 
that they’re playing off the bench, but when those guys come in they’re very ef-fective.”
  INJURY UPDATE: Sophomore Erik Murphy 
has been ruled out of Saturday’s matchup 
as he continues to recover from a mid-foot sprain he suffered in practice over 
the weekend. 
  Yeguete was ofﬁ  cially cleared to return 
to practice Thursday , but his status for the 
Ole Miss game is still unknown. 
  Although Parsons (ankle), Macklin 
(pectoral muscle) and junior Erving Walk-
er (hip pointer) are all dealing with linger-
ing injuries, each is expected to be ﬁ  ne for Saturday’s contest.    HOOPS , from page 14
Butler says Gators played ‘very soft game,’ need to toughen up
points.  The Tigers also made 18 of 
24 free throws.
  Auburn’s Blanche Alverson 
dominated the action in the open-ing period with makes on her ﬁ  rst three looks from beyond the arc en route to 13 ﬁ  rst-half points. 
  But UF kept it close and utilized 
a 6-0 run in the closing minutes of the opening half to take a ﬁ  ve-point advantage into the break.
  But Auburn responded with four 
points of its own to open the second half as a game with 13 lead changes and ﬁ  ve ties began to swing in the Tigers’ favor.
  Auburn’s Chantel Hilliard, a ju-
nior forward coming off the bench, provided the spark in the second. Hilliard had 11 of her game-high 17 points in the ﬁ  nal 20 minutes, help-ing Auburn extend its lead as the clock ticked down.
  Averaging just 68 points per 
game entering the contest, Flor-ida is not a team known for its of-fense. With less than seven min-utes remaining, 
the Tigers hit from long distance on consecutive possessions. AU’s lead expanded to double digits and Florida would never recover.
  “I just felt like we played a very 
soft game,” Butler said. “When we’re at our best, we’re playing with toughness. We didn’t bring it.”
  Jennifer George led the Gators 
with 10 points on 5-of-8 shoot-ing and Jaterra Bonds added nine points and four assists, but none of Florida’s players were able to grab more than ﬁ  ve rebounds.
  The Gators also missed on a 
number of easy looks, something 
Butler addressed in preparation for 
the two-game road trip.
  “You’re not going to beat a qual-
ity opponent on their court unless you’re tougher and paying atten-tion to detail, and we did neither,” Butler said. “We’ve got to under-stand that we’ve got to dig in, grit our teeth and be ready to battle.”

remedy that. 
  To a soldier returning to face the enemy 
in the bush, money is not a priority. Time 
alive meant more to him than money.   
  I thought I was a smart guy who played 
the angles. If an eyeless, legless carcass was to be shipped home in a body bag, I ensured his money, now useless to him, stayed with me.
  Sounds pitiless — worse, satanic — but 
excessive gambling bankrupts the soul. Ac-cording to the late actor Walter Matthau, “Poker exempliﬁ  es all the worst aspects of capitalism that make our country great.” 
  Matthau is dead on. Gambling is work.  If 
you enjoy gambling, or play poker to make friends, you’ve lost already. 
  You want a friend? Buy a dog.   Poker stayed lucrative for me, but gam-
bling didn’t. Like all compulsions, gambling narrows the world. Nothing else interested me. I herded with other gamblers only.  I 
abandoned all interests that didn’t jackham-
mer my jugular or tighten my intestines. 
They bored me. 
  Wherever I couldn’t ﬁ  nd a poker game, 
I’d ﬁ  nd a phone. It was much easier to place 
a bet than to drive all over New York to lo-
cate a poker game. 
  My gambling digressed from a calling to 
a compulsion. The more I fed it, the hungrier 
it got.  My family life suffered. I missed fam-
ily dinners, communions and birthdays be-
cause I was totally self-absorbed in my lust 
for action.    Each year, my downward ﬁ  nancial spi-
ral continued until I borrowed to gamble. I 
banged out credit cards, postponed paying bills and scrambled for cash to satisfy my in-satiable habit. 
  Despite the nightmare, I couldn’t ﬁ  nd the 
strength to abandon my compulsion. 
  Finally, I bottomed out. I owed money 
to every bookmaker I knew. (And I knew 
plenty.) 
  In desperation, I hit upon a plan. No sur-
prise that, since I was enslaved by my ad-
diction, my solution would exacerbate the 
problem.  
  I planned to make my compulsion work 
for me. I’d take action instead of betting. I’d 
become a bookie. 
  For the next seven years, I booked sports. 
As a bookie, my ﬁ  nancial situation changed dramatically. The results of that change and 
my expertise on various modes of gambling will be posted in future columns.
  Although some of your instructors sport 
multiple degrees, my futile education was most assuredly more expensive than theirs.  
  In the weeks ahead, I will reminisce about 
the inglorious results of bad life decisions 
and instruct readers on prohibitive odds.  
My tuition was expensive. Yours will be free, 
so read on and proﬁ  t from my mistakes.  
  Even if you cut the cards yourself, you 
couldn’t get a squarer deal.
