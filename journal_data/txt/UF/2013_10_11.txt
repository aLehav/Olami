As the government shutdown 
enters its 11th day, some students 
are ﬁ  nding it affects them in a way they never expected — if they can do their homework.
Classes that require use of gov-
ernment records are having to re-arrange their schedules to accom-modate the fact that many of the websites aren’t working.
Andrea Vidal, a 20-year-old UF 
public relations junior, said the most recent lab for her population geogra-phy class had to change from using Census data from states to compar-ing different countries, because the U.S. Census website is not running.
“You don’t expect your academic 
career to be affected by the govern-ment shutdown,” Vidal said. “Es-pecially an assignment, which is the most miniscule thing.”
She said she feels bad for her 
professor because he couldn’t have anticipated an unprecedented gov-ernment shutdown to mess up the assignment schedule.
“It’s a bit of an obstacle, but he’s 
handling it pretty well,” Vidal said.
John Paul Weesner, a Ph. D. stu-
dent who teaches site analysis on-line, wrote in an email that his class had a soil analysis assignment that students couldn’t complete.
He said one positive result of the 
shutdown is that it forces students to use the Marston library website to get information — or even go to the library itself. Still, he said he would postpone the next assignment, which analyzes land use and regula-tion, just in case sites still aren’t up.
For Austin Bracey, a chemical 
engineering student, the shutdown has stalled his research on redesign-ing drug structure to eliminate nega-tive side effects.
The 19-year-old UF sophomore 
said a program his research team needs is only accessible from the Na-tional Institutes of Health website, and for four or ﬁ  ve days it could not be accessed.
He said during that time he was 
frustrated and annoyed because it

Two student-founded companies are movin’ 
on up. 
Smarter Moving Solutions and 2 College 
Brothers, Inc. are joining to create what Wade Swikle called “one awesome student moving company.”
Swikle, the founder and owner of Smarter 
Moving Solutions, is teaming up with Bryan We-schler and Kevin Weschler, founders of 2 College Brothers, Inc. 
Their vision is to expand to college towns 
across America, Swikle said.
The companies only hire college students as 
movers, something Swikle said sets them apart from other moving companies in the areas they serve: Gainesville, Tallahassee and Orlando. 
He explained the two companies were com-
petitors but they decided consolidating would beneﬁ  t both the companies as well as the custom-ers. 
“I was actually sitting in a meeting, and we 
were talking about how we were going to ex-pand when we got a call from one of the brothers, who was looking to pursue other career options,” Swikle said. Student movers

Game shops throughout 
Gainesville are preparing for Nin-
tendo’s global release of Pokémon X and Y, slated for Saturday.Pokémon X and Y will be the ﬁ  rst 
Pokémon games released for the Nintendo 3DS and will be the ﬁ  rst fully 3-D Pokémon game in the of-ﬁ  cial franchise.  
The GameStop location on Ar-
cher Road has recorded more than 1,000 pre-orders of Pokemon X and Y, said sales associate Marcus John-son. The location will open its doors to customers tonight at 10 p.m., but customers will not be able to receive their copies until midnight.
Kyle Varnadore, store manager 
of R.U. Game, 5186 SW 34th St., has been eagerly waiting for the release.
“I’ve even bought the new spe-
cial edition X and Y 3DS consoles for myself,” he said.
Twenty-two-year-old UF me-
chanical engineering senior Wen Chen plans to buy Pokémon X. He expects the game to be very different from the last one.
Several new gameplay mechan-ics have been added to the game, in-cluding a “mega-evolution” which allows Pokémon to temporarily as-sume different forms in the middle of battle and receive bonuses.
Chen said the mega-evolution 
mechanic “might really change game dynamics.”
“The new game is going into a 
very interesting direction,” he said.

The president of a Gaines-
ville-based nonprofit is traveling 
across the Atlantic this weekend to speak about a topic he advo-cates at home: accessibility for disabled individuals.
Rafal Strzalkowski, the presi-
dent of Florida Disability Access and Awareness Foundation, will speak at the Eighth World Con-gress on Saturday in Munich. 
“I want to spread hope to par-
ents and educators,” he said. “I grew up in times when accessi-bility and accommodations were not in anyone’s vocabulary.”
Strzalkowski, a wheelchair-
bound lawyer, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was 1 year old. While growing up in Poland, he attended the Peto In-stitute for Conductive Education.
Strzalkowski said the program 
helped him comprehend his dis-ability and get the help that he needed.
“Conductive Education gave 
me a better understanding of my body, balance and strengths and how to use the limited abil-ity I do have to my advantage,” Strzalkowski said.
He said he began his nonprofit 
foundation, which is based in Gainesville, to raise awareness and help outfit local buildings with better accessibility.
The foundation’s treasurer, 
Paul Brophy, formerly owned The Shamrock Irish Restaurant, now Mother’s Pub.
He met Strzalkowski in 
2007 when he went to several Gainesville establishments in need of wheelchair-accessible re-strooms.
He said he began business with 
Strzalkowski after he realized his own establishment needed to be handicap-accessible.
As treasurer, Brophy’s work 
with the foundation includes coordinating with new and old establishments to add handicap accessibilities in compliance with the federal Americans with Dis-abilities Act.         
“Somebody in a wheelchair 
can get in the door, but they don’t have access to the bathrooms because the doors aren’t wide enough to accept a wheelchair,” Brophy said.
The foundation hopes to help 
local businesses by providing half of the funds in order for the establishment to incorporate ac-commodations.  
It’s currently creating a smart-
phone application that would al-low individuals with disabilities to locate nearby restaurants and businesses that offer the proper amenities.
“Unfortunately, we are going 
to have to do some very hectic fundraising because the app is very expensive,” Brophy said. “We were hoping to get it done by the end of this year.”
Strzalkowski said his hard 
work and commitment developed from individuals who didn’t be-lieve in him, and he believes in the impossible now.
“Nothing was given to me, 
and I had a strong drive to be the best that I can and show all the naysayers what I’m capable of,” Strzalkowski said. “Nothing is impossible.”

Residents mingled with police 
officers, horses and a helicopter at 
Gainesville Police’s Celebrating Safe Communities event Thursday.  
About 100 people showed up 
to Albert “Ray” Massey Westside Recreation Center on the corner of Northwest 34th Street and  North-west Eighth Avenue for the event, which brought officers and animals from every GPD unit as well as rep-resentatives from city agencies and other police departments.
“We’re excited to have everything 
in one place for citizens and taxpayers to see what their police department is doing,” said GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias.
Early in the night, officers from the K-9 unit did a demonstration with Brady the German shepherd. Later, the mounted unit showed up with cream-colored horses decorated with GPD badges.
A highlight of the night was when 
the Joint Aviation Unit helicopter lifted off the ground, blowing dust toward families watching from the edge of the field.
One of those families was Janine, 
Mel and Connor Hayes. Both parents said they thought the event was in-formative for residents.
“I thought it was free!” added 
9-year-old Connor, pulling bumper stickers, a water bottle and other gifts from a goodie bag.
Officer Nicole Tierney of the 
Crime Prevention Unit said the de-partment hopes to continue and ex-pand the event next year.
“We just want to make it easier on 
the community to see everything we do,” she said.Officers, horses and a

Gator Dining does more than sustain stu-
dents between meals. 
Gator Dining Services was presented this 
week with the Association for the Advance-
ment of Sustainability in Higher Education’s “Campus Sustainability Case Study Award for its Foam Free Dining program. Since it be-gan in 2011, the program has diverted about 1.2 million foam products from landfills, ac-cording to a press release. 
The foam cups, plates, bowls and to-go 
containers were replaced with compostable products. 
“Gator Dining Services has made strides 
towards ensuring a more sustainable dining operation on our campus,” Jill Rodriguez, sustainability manager for Gator Dining Ser-vices, wrote in an email. 
She said Gator Dining also stopped using 
plastic bags in Spring 2013. After its plastic-bag-free initiative, it received a UF Champi-ons for Change award in April. 
All plastic bags were replaced with paper 
bags, which can be composted or recycled.
The sustainability efforts are part of UF’s 
Zero Waste goal for 2015.
“It’s a good idea, but it’s more inconve-
nient,” said Aisha Imam, an 18-year-old UF biology freshman. 
She said the paper bags used by Gator 
Dining have no handles and are harder to carry, but she has noticed Gator Dining loca-tions are more sustainable than other local restaurants.
“I mean I think it is a good thing we’re 
making a step in the right direction support-ing the environment,” Imam said.Gator Dining wins sustainability

He said he became aware the shutdown might

The program became accessible again after a 
few days, Bracey said. He said he thinks someone realized the program was important enough to keep it running. 
Still, he said, his experience made him think 
more about the shutdown.

Because they were competing 
in the same areas for the same 
jobs, the merge will eliminate the tough choice some clients had to make between the companies, he said. 
“Our customers won’t have 
to pick between us,” Swikle said. “2 College Brothers have a much stronger branding than we had, and I think our marketing strate-gies will complement their struc-ture.”
The companies will merge 
under the 2 College Brothers, Inc. name but will incorporate features of Smarter Moving So-lutions in their management. 
Some customers of Smarter 
Moving Solutions said they are excited about the merge because it will extend the reach of both companies. 
Ricky Cuellar, the operations 
manager of music streaming site Grooveshark, said Smarter Moving Solutions was a big help when Grooveshark was moving one of its locations.
“I think the merge will be 
good,” he said. “(It) might give them a better rate. I’m sure his network now includes custom-ers from the other company. Now, they’ve got more hands on the ground to help more people move.”
A typical move with Smart-
er Moving Solutions costs $95 per hour, and a full move costs about $200 for a student. How-ever, pricing hasn’t been worked out post-merge. 
“Smarter Moving Solutions is 
the official mover of the UF Stu-dent Government, and 2 College Brothers was a 2012 Business of the Year finalist,” Swinkle wrote in an email.

Students drink coffee and study at Pascal’s Coffeehouse, two blocks north of campus on Northwest 
16th Street. Coffee shops’ management say business picks up around midterms.
� MIDTERMS TEND TO 
INCREASE BUSINESS.
NESHA ROBBINS
Alligator Contributing Writer
As midterms loom, Gainesville 
coffee shops tend to get more 
crowded with students who buy one drink and camp out for hours. But it’s often more of an annoyance to students than management.
Juan Alcala, a manager at Pas-
cal’s Coffeehouse at 112 NW 16th St. near Midtown, said in the after-noons during exam weeks, it is of-ten hard for people to ﬁ  nd seats.
But like other shops, she said,  
Pascal’s embraces the business, not-ing the coffee shop aims to give stu-dents a place to come and study.
Yarrow Geggus, a barista at Vol-
ta Coffee, Tea & Chocolate at 48 SW Second St. in downtown Gainesville said the shop also experiences more trafﬁ  c during midterms, but the employees don’t mind people buy-ing one drink and lingering.
“It doesn’t get overwhelming,” 
Geggus said.
Christina Chang, a 22-year-old UF recreation, parks and tourism senior, said she usually goes to cof-fee shops to study, but she avoids the atmosphere during midterms and ﬁ  nals.
“Everyone is out then, and I can’t 
ﬁ  nd a place to park,” she said.
Jenny Nguyen, a 21-year-old UF 
recreation, parks and tourism se-nior, said she would rather go to a coffee shop to study than a library because the atmosphere isn’t as stressful.
“It’s not eerily quiet,” Nguyen 
said. “You can have a conversation if you want to.”Local coffee shops not steamed

The United States doesn’t 
have as many highly skilled 
adults as other countries, but younger generations could break the trend.
The Survey of Adult Skills, 
conducted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, found the U.S.  falls short on levels of skilled workers compared to other de-veloped countries.
Of the 24 countries sur-
veyed, the U.S. was ranked 16th, and the majority of work-ers only possessed low-level skills, which include literacy, problem-solving and informa-tion and communication tech-nology, according to the study.
UF education professor 
Dorene Ross said many educa-tional factors can affect some-one’s achievement later in life. One of the main problems she saw was the inequality in edu-cation due to economics.
“If you are living in poverty, 
you are dealing with a wide variety of social and environ-mental threats that affect the achievement of kids in school,” she said.
About 21 percent of work-
ers are overqualiﬁ  ed for jobs, and about 13 percent are un-derqualiﬁ  ed, according to the study.
Legislators have been im-
plementing policy changes in the U.S. to aid the job market by attempting to produce better workers. There have been push-es toward vocational schools and incorporating more on-the-job training into learning.
Ross agreed education 
should be improved but said certain policies won’t work. The focus on testing and merit-based pay for teachers, in her opinion, isn’t the way to go.
“There seems to be an as-
sumption that teachers and kids are holding back,” she said. “But teachers are teaching the best way they know how, and children are learning the best way they know how.”
People with lower skill lev-
els tend be in poorer health, participate less in civic activities and to trust others less, accord-ing to the study.
Younger generations are 
less hindered by their socioeco-nomic backgrounds than older generations. U.S. adults aged 16-65 had the strongest correla-tion between literacy rates and economic background, but that dropped to about average when looking at 16-24 year olds.
Rachel Werk, a 19-year-old 
UF neuroscience and English junior, said she thinks further-ing education could improve someone’s abilities, but with some qualiﬁ  cations.
“It’s a double-edged sword, 
really,” she said, “because we’re learning all these things at school but not necessarily putting our skills to work.”US adults lower skilled

Readers, this is not a drill: Fall is ﬁ  nally upon us in 
Gainesville. The mornings are crisper, the nights are pleas-
antly cool, and we’re ﬁ  nally switching from iced coffee to hot pumpkin lattes. Everything is beautiful and nothing hurts.
Well, maybe not: The government is still shut down, and 
Congress is scrambling for a solution to the looming debt ceiling problem. According to Public Policy Polling, Amer-icans’ approval rating of Congress is lower than their ap-proval rate of Wall Street, zombies and hipsters.

Darts & Laurels
First, a LAUREL to citizen lawn mower Chris Cox, who 
made headlines this week for appearing at Lincoln Memo-rial Reﬂ  ecting Pool in Washington, D.C. armed with garden-ing tools and busy tidying what’s been neglected during the shutdown.
“I want to encourage my friends and fellow Americans to 
go to their parks and show up with a trash bag and a rake,” he told the Washington Post. “Show up with a good attitude and ﬁ  rm handshake for the U.S. Park Service.”
We could DART the government for a plethora of rea-
sons, but today we’re aiming speciﬁ  cally at the government ofﬁ  cials responsible for approving the Utah National Guard’s purchase of a $47,174 mechanical bull.
According to Gawker, “The National Guard put in the 
request for a ‘Mechanical Bull Sales bull which needs to be durable & low maintenance’ on Sept. 14. And, unlike the 7,000 preschool children enrolled in Head Start whose low maintenance eating and learning needs are not currently be-ing met, the government came through with a bull.”
Sounds like a load of bulls**t to us.On to happier news: The Nobel Prizes! The Nobel Prize in 
physics was awarded to the team responsible for the Higgs boson — or “God” — particle.
According to a UF News release, a group of about 40 
UF faculty, research personnel and students contributed to the discovery of the Higgs particle, especially Guenakh Mitselmakher, Andrey Korytov, Darin Acosta, Paul Avery, Richard Field, Ivan Furic, Jacobo Konigsberg, Konstantin Matchev and John Yelton. This week, we give a LAUREL to 
the UF scientists who assisted in this important discovery.
Of course, not all scientiﬁ  c endeavors are so noble. This 
week, Digital Journal reported a new cure for premature ejaculation has hit the market in a form of a spray called Pro-mescent that desensitizes men and works to prolong sexual activity. We suppose providing a quick ﬁ  x for those living under the heavy burden of premature ejaculation is more marketable than, say, developing cures for AIDS or a Plan B pill that doesn’t make you barf.
Wait a minute, no it’s not. A DART to the Promescent 
developers and our condolences to their poor mothers who have to explain what their sons do for a living to their book clubs.

to receive, and it’s probable that records will be broken 
this year.
According to NobelPeacePrize.org, the 259 nomina-
tions have set the record for most nominees for a single 
Nobel Prize. 
An eclectic assemblage of statesmen, activists, writ-
ers and others nominated for the prize throughout his-tory remind us of why the Nobel Peace Prize is an im-portant recognition. 
For instance, Martin Luther King Jr. was awarded the 
1964 prize for his nonviolent struggle for civil rights. 
The 1990 award was presented to Mikhail Gorbachev 
for his role in dismantling the international peace pro-cess. 
Alfred Nobel, according to the Nobel Peace Prize 
website, stated in his will the prize should be awarded to “the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.” 
Abiding by such criteria, the nominations of fascists 
like Stalin and Mussolini should arouse question — if not disgust — in the historian’s mind. 
I mention the dictators because this year, conﬁ  rmed 
by the Washington Times and to my own irritation, Vladimir Putin was nominated. 
The immediate inclination is that whoever nominat-
ed the pseudo-Tsarist did so with the same intention of E.G.C Brandt, the Swedish parliamentarian who nomi-nated Hitler as a joke. 
However, the nomination serves as no joke. The Rus-
sian president was nominated for his role in the Syrian arms agreement. It would be callous and an 
unreasonable disservice to give the award to Putin when he shares the nomination cat-egory with brave individuals such as the members of Pussy Riot or the 16-year-old Mala-la Yousafzai or even Chelsea Manning. 
All of these people have been afﬁ  rmed as candidates 
by MSN news and have done something extraordinary at their own expense. 
Malala was shot in the head for resisting the Taliban 
and endorsing the education of women. 
The Russian punk rock-band Pussy Riot was jailed 
for its performance of a song in a church. According to the Guardian, one of the members was faced with a 17-hour workday while on a hunger strike. 
Ostensibly, 2013 has been privy to some of the most 
inspirational heroines, and the struggle for equality be-tween men and women continues. 
This brings me to my favorite candidate: Dr. Denis 
Mukwege. 
Mukwege, according to the Guardian, is a Congolese 
gynecologist who has spent 14 years in one of the most tumultuous war zones on earth, providing medical care to victims of violent rape. 
The Guardian reported that Mukwege has treated 
more than 30,000 rape victims in the Democratic Re-public of Congo, an accomplishment that deserves to be lauded without restraint. 
So as you read this, remember that regardless of who 
has won the award, there are a number of deserving in-dividuals who operate invisibly in the name of human rights every day without recognition or applause.

Depression appears to be 
caused by an imbalance in the levels of neurotransmit-
ters in the brain. 
Antidepressants impact some of 
these chemicals, such as serotonin 
and norepinephrine, in an attempt to rebalance the brain’s chemical makeup. Some of the most com-mon antidepressants are classiﬁ  ed as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as Prozac and Zoloft, and serotonin-norepi-nephrine reuptake inhibitors (SN-RIs), like Cymbalta and Effexor. 
Both medications block the ab-
sorption of certain neurotransmit-
ters into the brain, leaving higher levels of those compounds ﬂ  oating around and returning the brain to a balanced chemical state.
Doctors diagnose depression 
through an evaluation of symptom severity and longevity, family his-tory of depression and suicidal ide-ation. Typically, if patients present long-lasting and severe symptoms, they will be treated with antidepres-sants. 
Oftentimes this treatment is sup-plemented with psychotherapy so the patient can work through life is-sues, learn how to cope with the ill-ness and manage its triggers. 
Patients usually have to try sev-
eral different types of medications in order to ﬁ  nd one that works, because everyone has different brain chemis-try and symptomatic complaints.
Yet various researchers argue that 
this trial and error process might be a waste of time for some patients. 
According to analysis of clini-
cal trial data from the FDA, taking placebo pills improved depressive symptoms almost equally as much as taking antidepressants. The only clinically signiﬁ  cant difference oc-curred in severely depressed pa-tients.
This does not necessarily mean 
antidepressants are ineffective, how-ever, and these studies fail to take into account a couple of important issues in the psychiatric ﬁ  eld. For one, depression is currently over-diagnosed. 
According to a study done by the 
International Review of Psychiatry, nearly a quarter of the U.S. popula-tion has been prescribed antidepres-sants at some point. Only about 10 percent, however, actually have a depressive disorder. Doctors often confuse periodic depression brought on by illness, substance abuse, or other factors to be a diagnosable mental illness and pop out the pills. 
Psychotherapy, light therapy, 
and exercise can be just as effective in minor cases of depression and should be utilized by doctors more often as treatment.
Additionally, as mentioned be-
fore, patients typically try several medications before ﬁ  nding one that ﬁ  ts their depressive symptoms and makes them feel better. Clinical tri-als do not account for this process of trial and error and simply examine the data from each pill without ex-amining each participant’s chemical makeup or response to other drugs. Maybe some antidepressants are in-effective for some patients, but oth-ers are still likely to be helpful for patients who truly do suffer from depression.
It is debated whether antidepres-
sants should be used for their place-bo effect. On the one hand, the drugs have potential side effects. Suicidal ideation, increased risk of stroke in women and general personality changes are just a few of the possible results. 
Additionally, antidepressants 
are often used over a lifetime, which can rack up quite a medical bill. On the other hand, however, if patients truly do feel better and need that re-assurance to get through a difﬁ  cult period of depression, some doctors argue it is OK to keep prescribing the drugs.
Dr. Durga Roy, a psychiatrist at 
The Johns Hopkins Hospital, said she will sometimes let patients take antidepressants, at least for a brief six-month period, to enhance their mood and boost morale. 
“Sometimes patients will come 
to me saying they are depressed because a relative just died or some other event occurred and that they need antidepressants,” she said. “If they’re not at high risk for seizures or stroke I’ll let them take the medi-cation to bump their mood. I’ve never seen any patients that have had personality changes or that sud-denly started having seizures.” 
In an ideal world, clinical trials 
would study each depressed patient individually and track which anti-depressants worked for them and which did not. In this way, research-ers could still prove the effectiveness of the drug for certain patients and rule out the possibility that the study participants might respond better to another drug. Since this takes time and money, however, it is not cur-rently a plausible solution.
Ultimately, the antidepressant-
bashing data analysis of clinical trials is inconclusive and unproductive. 
Until scientists ﬁ  nd a way to 
physically deﬁ  ne depression, per-haps by using a brain scan that mea-sures neurotransmitters or some other method, clinical trials will have to rely on subjective data that simply cannot prove general efﬁ  ciency.

UWireLetter to the Editor
It’s true: Engineers don’t really 
socialize
I agree that engineers don’t really 
socialize. 
What is socializing anyway? Ac-
cording to the Total Frat Move, it’s 
about hanging out at run-down Mid-town bars or becoming the drunkest people at a NASCAR race. 
I suppose hanging out in the For-
mula Car lab until late hours of the night with your best friends is not socializing. How about hanging out at the Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art talking about the intricate con-nection between engineering and art? Nah, wine and classical doesn’t cut it for a beer pong game.
About being the “hottest:” Since 
we are talking about the cursory, how would the list look 10 years af-ter graduation? Invariably, some will think being 
hot is having money; then the list would deﬁ  nitely not display jour-nalism at the forefront.
To ﬁ  nish my letter, let me hastily 
generalize about most journalism majors: It’s great to see that the role models at the journalism school are Victoria’s Secret models and Miss Floridas and not old boring Judith Miller or Maureen Dowd. 
It is deﬁ  nitely a solid business 
model — for the “hottest” ones, that is.
If the time-pressed Alligator 
writers need to quote another ar-ticle to ﬁ  ll the front page, can they at least quote respectable journalism? If I want to read something from the TFM, I’ll just go to their website.

Aaron’s Party is coming to 
Gainesville.
Pop star Aaron Carter will 
perform at High Dive on Sun-
day. Doors open at 7 p.m., and the show — which includes The Crazy Carls, The Real Hooks and Brie Goldsobel — starts an hour later. General admission tickets are $15 in advance and $18 at the door, available at tktwb.tw/GI-Alq5, Hear Again Music or High Dive.
The Alligator spoke with Cart-
er, a Tampa native, last week.
Q: What can you tell me about 
your tour?
A: It’s live music. I do all of my 
hits from the past — you know, “Aaron’s Party,” “I Love Candy,” “How I Beat Shaq” — I take all of them, and we do a new show.Q: I think a 
lot of the people who are go-ing to be com-ing to your Gainesville con-cert are proba-bly UF students who remember 
you from a few years ago. What should they know about you now?
A: Well, I’ve grown up, you 
know, and I’m 25 years old. I’ve been working on my craft, and ... becoming a better singer. So I think that the show really focuses on my talents as a performer.
Q: What can people expect 
when they come?
A: They can expect to just 
come and have a good time. It’s live music, and I ... do a lot of the stuff that I’ve done before, so it’s nostalgic for people too. It’s nos-talgic for me, and it’s amazing. It’s just a really good time. I en-courage people to just come out and check it out.

Gainesville resident and UF 
alumnus Frederick Malphurs’ 
newest novel, which is now available for sale on Amazon, ties together his experience in veteran affairs and his love for Spanish folklore.
“A Year in the Life of Dr. 
Fox,” set in a small Mexican community, explains the difﬁ  -cult decision to put loved ones at risk when it comes to drug wars, immigration and eco-nomic aid.
“The book explains vio-
lence and corruption,” Mal-phurs said. “Illegal drugs are a big problem in Mexico.”
The novel takes readers to 
a place they’ve never heard of, Malphurs said
The strength of family, how 
active religious organizations are in Mexico as well as good versus evil are issues the main characters deal with through-out the ﬁ  ction novel.
“The theme of the novel 
is to provide a contemporary understanding for people who read about big issues and crimes in the area,” Malphurs said. “I wanted to provide a hero who is based in reality.”
Malphurs said his pas-
sion to write comes from the strength and opportunities that exist in the Gainesville community.
Although the inspiration to 
write this novel came from a trip to Mexico, the supportive atmosphere in Gainesville led him to become an indepen-dent, self-published author, Malphurs said.
“I have learned the hard 
way that traditional market-ing for someone who isn’t established doesn’t work,” Malphurs said. “The fact that Gainesville has groups who give me support encourages me to publish books on top-ics most people haven’t heard of.”
Julia Sutton, an 18-year-
old UF accounting freshman, said the novel could be of in-terest to students because of the author’s connection to the Gainesville community.
Given the number of people 
who try to get published, Sut-ton said, it’s amazing someone close to home achieved it.
“I would read the book be-
cause it’s an entertaining way to gain an emotional back-ground on an issue students constantly debate about,” she said.8, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, OCTOBER 11, 2013

Today is the last day Starbucks 
is offering a free coffee to generous 
patrons.
Since Wednesday, the coffee chain has 
been giving free tall brewed coffees to customers who offer to buy a stranger’s drink. 
Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, 
posted a letter Tuesday explaining his pay-it-forward initiative online.
Jaime Riley,  a Starbucks spokeswoman, 
said it was inspired by current problems in America and its government. 
“It’s an initiative put forth to help 
show stability and acts of kindness,” Riley said.
Some students weren’t aware of the 
offer but still saw it as a nice gesture.
“I’m always all for that.” said 
Savannah Green, an 18-year-old UF theatre performance freshman. “I’ve had people pay for me before in Starbucks drive-thrus just as a generosity.” 
Students like Diana 
Alarcon said it’s a way 
to be nice to others and not be so selﬁ  sh. She 
said she would pay for someone’s drink, even if it was more than hers.
“I think there’s a human element to 
that,” said Alarcon, a 21-year-old UF  industrial and systems engineering senior. “It opens communication and it promotes having compassion for the person behind you. I think that’s something we don’t get enough of — that human interaction.”
On-campus Starbucks employees 
were unable to comment regarding the initiative. Pay-it-forward deal at 
Starbucks stores ends today

The loss still stings Ronald 
Powell. 
After two years of waiting 
and wondering if he would get 
another chance to play in Tiger Stadium, Powell will have his opportunity when No. 17 Flor-ida faces No. 10 LSU on Satur-day in Baton Rouge, La.
Powell missed the majority 
of the Gators’ 41-11 loss to the Tigers in Death Valley during the 2011 season. 
He suffered a stinger and 
was forced to stand on the side-lines as Florida dropped its sec-ond consecutive game. 
The loss stands as Florida’s 
worst defeat since Will Mus-champ began coaching the team in 2011.
“It still bothers me today,” 
Powell said. 
“Getting a chance to go back 
there and perform with the guys I got now is going to be special for me.”
Powell’s return to Tiger Sta-
dium coincides with redshirt junior quarterback Tyler Mur-phy’s first true road test. 
LSU has won 13 of its last 18 
games against top-25 teams in Death Valley under coach Les Miles. That includes two of the Tigers’ three matchups with the Gators.
Murphy was forced to watch 
as Florida dropped its last game at Tiger Stadium in humiliating fashion. He was a redshirt freshman 
buried on the depth chart when true freshman Jacoby Brissett  completed only eight passes and tossed two interceptions during his first career start.
“Baton Rouge is a very lively place. It’ll be a very hostile envi-ronment,” Murphy said. 
“As a team, we will have to 
focus on ourselves and not get caught up in the hype and all

Florida enters the upcoming season hav-
ing lost more than half of its scoring output 
from 2012-13, but coach Billy Donovan is not looking for one player to be the savior on the offensive end. 
Guards Kenny Boynton, Mike Rosario 
and forward Erik Murphy — UF’s three top scorers last season — have graduated. 
Thanks largely to that trio’s success, 
Florida finished last season as the seventh-most efficient offensive squad in the coun-try, according to KenPom.com, en route to a third consecutive trip to the Elite Eight. 
Despite several key departures, Dono-
van does not plan on altering his team’s of-fensive philosophy. “I’m not comparing this 
team to the same team, but we’re in the similar situation as years ago with (Matt) Walsh, (Anthony) Roberson and David Lee leaving. (Corey) Brewer was our leading scorer coming back with [7.5] 
points per game (in 2004-05),” Donovan said. 
“Obviously, that team turned out to be a 
whole lot better than everyone thought they would be with the departure of those guys. We’re in the same situation offensively. It’s not about looking for one guy. 
“We have to be a team that’s balanced. 
We have to be an unselfish team, an extra-pass team. We have to be really great at moving and passing the basketball.”
Last season, the Gators had four players 
who averaged double-figure scoring. 
Center Patric Young, who averaged 10.1 
points per game on 58.6 percent shooting, is UF’s only returning double-digit scorer. 
UF also brings back guard Michael Fra-
zier II, its best three-point shooter with a 46.8-percent clip.
The Gators will look to newcomers, such 
as freshman point guard Kasey Hill, Rutgers transfer guard Eli Carter — after he returns from injury — and Virginia Tech transfer Dorian Finney-Smith to pick up where the offense left off.

Julie Macedo is ready to run.
With top runners Agata 
Strausa, Stephanie Strasser and Cory McGee getting a week of rest as the women’s cross coun-try team travels to Orlando for the Disney Cross Country Classic, Florida’s younger team members have an opportunity to compete at the college level.
“We’re training hard and not 
tapering for this meet,” Macedo said. “The past few weeks, all of the workouts have been strong, and all of the girls are looking good.”
Five runners will be compet-
ing for the Gators this weekend: Macedo, freshmen Taylor Tubbs and Amber Johnson, junior Macy Huskey and redshirt se-nior Brittany Koziara.
Coach Paul Spangler hopes 
to see at least one of them step up during the 5K race on Satur-day. Spangler is looking to de-termine who will travel with the team to compete at the Wiscon-sin adidas Invitational on Oct. 19, the team’s last meet before the Southeastern Conference Championships on Nov. 1.
“You kind of have an idea 
where everybody is ﬁ  tness-wise and you can project ‘OK, where do we stand and how good are we?’” he said. 
“But you’re always look-
ing for that one person to have that breakthrough performance. You’re going to have races where maybe somebody doesn’t have the best race, so when you have somebody have an unex-pected performance, it can re-ally help out.”
Macedo has the ability to 
be one of those top runners. As a true freshman last year, she earned a spot on the SEC All-Freshman team by posting a time of 22:03.55 at the SEC Championships, which was eighth among Florida runners.
“It was exciting to come in 
and be able to contribute right away,” Macedo said. “As a freshman, you don’t always ex-pect to travel, and it was a nice surprise.“
Despite the accolades, the 
sophomore felt that her perfor-mance was subpar.
“Last season, I actually didn’t 
do that well for my standards, so this year I’m looking to improve a lot,” Macedo said. “I want to be All-SEC, which means top seven.”
Macedo has competed in 
both meets for the women’s team this season. 
She ﬁ  nished third at the 
Western Carolina Invitational on Aug. 30, running the two-mile course in a time of 10:57.89. 
She placed second on the 
team and sixth overall at the Mountain Dew Invitational on Sept. 14, posting a time of 21:37.94 on the 6K track — al-most 30 seconds faster than her time at the SEC Championships in November 2012. 
Macedo is aiming to keep 
the momentum going and earn a spot at the Wisconsin adidas Invitational.
“I’m looking to run a person-
al best, score for my team and do as well as I can” Macedo said. Gators preparing to

Each week, two alligator-
Sports columnists will debate the biggest looming 
matchup in college football. To-day, Phillip Heilman and Adam Lichtenstein preview No. 17 Florida’s showdown against No. 10 LSU in Baton Rouge, La., on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. on CBS.
Adam: Florida’s real schedule is about to start. Af-
ter playing a mid-major, three Southeastern Confer-ence weaklings and Miami, the Gators are about to enter the roughest stretch of their season. 
They will play three straight ranked opponents 
that will make or break Florida’s shot for an SEC title, and it all starts on Saturday in Tiger Stadium.
The Gators have shown they are a resilient team. 
They have been without their offensive and defen-sive leaders for two games, and they have come away with two convincing victories.
After Florida marches into Death Valley as the un-
derdog, it will come out with a third.
The Gators have shown all season that their de-
fense is an unstoppable force. They haven’t just lim-ited opposing offenses, they have shut them down. Offenses were completely unable to break through a powerful rush defense or a shut-down pass defense.
Although LSU will be the best offense Florida has 
faced, the defense will rise to the challenge and take down the Tigers.
Phillip: Thanks for making my job easy, Adam. 
You already stated my ﬁ  rst point: Florida hasn’t played anybody.
For as well as the Gators’ defense has played to 
this point of the season — incredibly considering what it lost from 2012 — it has only faced one team that is averaging even mediocre numbers in 2013. And Miami promptly handed Florida its only loss of the season.
Of the ﬁ  ve games Florida has played, Miami’s of-
fense, which is tied for 24th in the nation, is the only team that cracks the top 60 in the country. Toledo is next at 65th. The trio of measly SEC teams UF has lambasted sits 84th, 85th and 91st in the country in total offense.
The Gators are in for a rude awakening in Death 
Valley on Saturday.
Led by senior quarterback Zach Mettenberger, 
LSU’s offense is far superior than even the Miami unit that shredded Florida during the ﬁ  rst quarter of its 21-16 win on Sept. 7. The Tigers are scoring an in-sane 45.5 points per game and accumulating nearly 500 yards of total offense.
Even if Florida cuts those averages in half, the 
Gators will lose by a touchdown.
Adam: The Tigers have had nearly as easy of a 
schedule. Only two teams they faced are inside the top 50 for total defense. TCU — the top defense LSU has faced — held the Tigers to their second-lowest output of the season. And the Horned Frogs are 32 spots lower than the Gators in that category.
Yes, Florida struggled 
early against Miami, but that was against a team the Gators 
had not played in ﬁ  ve years. 
They play the Tigers every season and are more fa-miliar with the boys from the bayou. And once UF got a chance to settle in against UM, the defense ex-celled and has not looked back.
In the 15 quarters the Gators have played since 
surrendering 14 points to the Hurricanes in the ﬁ  rst quarter in South Florida, the defense has allowed 27 points total. Seven of those points came on a 4-yard Miami drive after a turnover, and seven more came in garbage time against Tennessee. That’s absurd.
Mettenberger has had a great season throwing the 
football, but he has not faced a quality pass defense. Florida is No. 6 in the country at defending against the air attack — 50 spots higher than LSU’s top op-ponent.
This is clearly a game of strength against strength. 
LSU is great on offense, Florida is all about the de-fense.
And, like the cliché says, defense wins champion-
ships.
Phillip: Since the end of the 2009 season, the Ti-
gers have lost just once at home. Once! 
And that was last year — a game LSU should have 
won — to eventual champion Alabama. 
It is incredibly rare for the Tigers to be taken out in 
Death Valley — ask the Florida squad that got pum-meled by 30 points there two years ago — especially without a star quarterback. And guess what? Florida doesn’t have one of those.
Everything that Tyler Murphy has touched to this 
point in the season has turned into gold, but I’m will-ing to bet this is the week he becomes a pumpkin. 
That is not to say Murphy will look as lost as Ja-
coby Brissett did in Tiger Stadium in 2011, but his numbers are going to take a hit playing in front of the most raucous crowd in the nation.
Matt Jones and Mack Brown will continue to 
struggle to ﬁ  nd holes in the running game, which is going to put the onus on Murphy to make plays throughout the game. I don’t believe he can do it. 
Murphy found the softest landing spot on Flori-
da’s schedule to come in and play well right away. 
Tennessee sucks. Kentucky sucks. Arkansas sucks 
a little less. But the fun and games are over. The bul-lies of the SEC are on their way. 
Until Murphy shows me something against a real 
team, I will remain skeptical. 
If he beats LSU on Saturday, then maybe I will 
think differently, but that’s not going to happen.Who will win the UF-LSU game?

points on 38.4 percent shooting for the Scar-let Knights last season. 
Hill, who showed a knack for finding the 
open man in high school, should help from a distribution standpoint as one of Florida’s floor generals.
“I do think — and really believe — that 
we have to be a team that has five or six guys in double-digit scoring,” Donovan said. 
“There are just so many unknowns on our 
team right now. As a coach, because there are the unknowns, you can’t just say, ‘OK, you’re that guy for us right now.’ It has to be done collectively as a group.”
 Yeguete progressing: Will Yeguete is 
questionable for the start of the season and will not be cleared to practice on Friday, but the senior forward’s right knee is beginning to feel better, he said during Florida’s media day on Wednesday.
On May 22, Yeguete underwent ar-
throscopic debridement on his knee — his second knee procedure in a four-month span — to remove loose cartilage. Although he currently does not feel any soreness in his knee, he still feels he needs to regain strength in his leg. 
“I feel good right now,” Yeguete said. 
“[The team doctors are] just kind of afraid that they’d put me out there too fast. I’m able to run around and doing non-contact. So we’ll see in the next few weeks.”
Yeguete said he has not tried dunking yet 
but thinks he could. 
Last season, Yeguete averaged 5.5 points 
and 5.8 rebounds as one of Florida’s key re-serves off the bench. 
He missed six games during the lat-
ter stretch of the Southeastern Conference schedule after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery in February to remove bone chips in his knee. that stuff. Just treat it as another game, have a 
good week of practice and try to continue to get better and execute like we’ve been doing.”
Murphy has surpassed expectations after 
coming off the bench to replace an injured Jeff Driskel during the first quarter against Tennes-see. 
If he were to finish this season at his current 
completion rate of 72 percent, he would top Wayne Peace’s school record of 70.7 percent in 1982. 
Murphy’s insertion into the starting lineup 
comes with the continued success of a defense that ranks at the top of nearly every statistical category. 
Despite a season-ending injury to defensive 
tackle Dominique Easley, the Gators have held their own with Powell, Dante Fowler Jr., Jona-than Bullard and Darious Cummings picking up the slack.
“It all flips when you wake up that morning 
and we do our little walk-through, and all that stuff,” Fowler said. “As soon as I wake up on Saturday, it’s game time, and I’m locked in and focused.”
Florida is better equipped this time around 
for LSU. 
It has a healthy Powell, a blossoming quar-
terback and a tougher identity — three keys missing when the two teams last played in Ba-ton Rouge.
“We’ve got a lot more people that have 
bought in to what Coach ‘Champ wants to do,” Powell said. 
“We got a great coaching staff, and every-
body is out there and having fun, flying around and being physical.” FRIDAY, OCTOBER 11, 2013 § ALLIGATOR, 15

Now onto the picks!
In first with a record of 29-16-3 is alli-
gatorSports Editor Phillip “OH, MY GOD! 
A RACCOON! RUN!” Heilman, who re-gressed into a terrified 5-year-old when he saw a raccoon hop out of a dumpster dur-ing his walk home from work this week. In the words of sports personality Dan Pat-rick, “If you’re scared, buy a dog.” Or, in this case, a ‘coon hound.
Sitting in second with a record of 28-
17-3 alligatorSports Staff Writer Joe “PEER PRESSURE PANIC!” Morgan, who threw out his back when running in fear after Phillip when the raccoon popped out. We’re not sure which is weaker: your back or your resolve.
In third place with a record of 27-18-3 
is alligatorSports Assistant Editor Adam “Redneck Wannabe” Lichtenstein, who channeled his inner red-blooded American by downloading a deer hunter game on his iPhone. I guess downloading an app is cheaper than purchasing a firearm. Maybe Brent Pease will play with you sometime, bud.
In fourth — first in the non-alligator-
Sports division — with a record of 26-19-3 is FightinGators.net’s Cody “RELEASE THE KIMBREL!” Jones, who was incred-ibly upset when Braves manager Fredi Gonzalez left Craig Kimbrel in the bullpen while David Carpenter gave up a season-ending home run to Juan Uribe. It’s Octo-ber, Cody. You should be used to this by now.
Coming in fifth with a record of 25-
20-3 is alligatorSports Staff Writer Adam “Dude, where’s my phone?” Pincus, who meandered helplessly around the Univer-sity Women’s Club on Wednesday after a colleague retrieved his lost phone and hid it in a fake plant. Hey Pincus, can you hear us now?
Tied with Pincus for fifth is 247Sports.com’s Thomas “Just call me coach” Gold-kamp, whose dedication to watching film of Florida has led to a few awkward back-and-forth exchanges with Pease. “It’s called the Jets package,” Thomas. If you don’t know the terminology, why don’t you just shut that hole in your face you call a mouth.
Back to where he belongs in dead-ass 
last with a piss-poor record of 22-23-3 is InsidetheGators.com’s Bryan “I GOT IT! I GOT IT! I...” Holt, who has looked more lost in this year’s Picks Column than Rays outfielder Wil Myers did in right field at Fenway Park last Friday. Yeah, buddy. We’re sure those sunglasses will help you out. 
Not to be outdone by Holt’s inepti-
tude and also sitting in dead-ass last with a piss-poor record of 22-23-3 is Orlando Sentinel’s Edgar “This message has no content” Thompson, who has developed a weird habit of sending entire emails writ-ten in the subject line. Would it kill you to click in the body of the email, or, I don’t know, send a text?

It took more than 35 minutes 
for Florida to commit a penalty 
against Arkansas on Saturday. But once the ﬁ  rst ﬂ  ag was thrown, they littered the ﬁ  eld.
The No. 17 Gators (4-1, 3-0 
Southeastern Conference) commit-ted eight penalties for 84 yards in the second half against the Razor-backs after completing their ﬁ  rst penalty-free half under coach Will Muschamp before halftime. 
“Aggressive penalties we can 
handle, we can take,” defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin said.
“Dumb penalties, penalties that 
are totally avoidable, those are the ones we can’t have and need to correct, and we deal with pretty matter-of-factly and harshly.”
The dam broke when referees 
ﬂ  agged center Jon Harrison for un-sportsmanlike conduct in the third quarter. Harrison allegedly made contact with a referee after a play, and he was disqualiﬁ  ed for the rest of the game.
“Jon’s an emotional guy,” coach 
Will Muschamp said after the game. “He lost his temper and did something he shouldn’t have done. He was ejected from the game, and rightfully so.”
From there, the penalty yardage 
came in bunches, and three of the ﬂ  ags cost Florida 15 yards each.
Sam linebacker Ronald Powell 
and Buck linebacker Dante Fowler Jr. both roughed the passer and Powell was ﬂ  agged for unsports-manlike conduct.
Both of Powell’s penalties came 
on Arkansas’ ﬁ  nal drive, in which the Razorbacks advanced to the Gators 3-yard line.
“Some of those in that game 
those were close calls,” Durkin said. “Our guys we deﬁ  nitely don’t want to slow them down. We (want) them playing aggressive. That’s part of why we’ve been able to be effective this time of year.”
Cornerback close to returning: 
Junior Marcus Roberson has not played since suffering a sprained knee against Miami on Sept. 7, but Durkin said he expects the corner-back to play against No. 10 LSU (5-1, 2-1 SEC) on Saturday.
“He’s continuing to get bet-
ter and better like you’d except a guy coming off an injury,” Durkin said.
Roberson practiced prior to 
Florida’s games against Kentucky and Arkansas but did not play.
Roberson has four tackles in 
2013 and one pass breakup in two games.
“We want to make sure he’s 100 
percent when we put him out there on the ﬁ  eld,” Durkin said.
Gators add killer threat: In the 
absence of defensive lineman Do-minique Easley (knee), Florida has added a friend of his to team meet-ings — Easley’s stuffed “Chucky” doll.
Chucky, the star of the “Child’s 
Play” ﬁ  lm series, has sat in on de-fensive meetings with the rest of the unit.
Since Easley suffered a torn 
ACL, Fowler has taken over doll duty, carrying the movie character to postgame interviews.
“He always has the Chucky doll 
everywhere he goes,” defensive back Jaylen Watkins said on Sept. 30. “Actually seeing that made ev-erybody cheer up a little bit about not having [Easley] there.”
Added Durkin: “Chucky’s wel-
come in all our meetings. … He’s learning the defense.”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Jaterra Bonds is gearing up for her last 
season with the Gators. 
Bonds, a Gainesville native and arguably 
the face of Florida women’s basketball, will 
be asked to shoulder a heavy load following the graduation of Jennifer George and the departure of three transfers. 
“This year is the most important year,” 
she said. “I’m just trying to cherish every mo-ment and make the most out of each one.”
Bonds led the Gators in scoring with 13.1 
points per game last season. She also paced UF by averaging 34 minutes per contest. 
“Her expectations are always to lead and 
to be a big factor for this team,” sophomore January Miller said. 
With a new supporting cast this season, 
the offense has been tweaked to better suit the team’s strengths. Florida values its speed as its biggest asset.
“This is probably the fastest team since 
I’ve been here,” Bonds said. “That’s the kind of basketball we want to play.”
Coach Amanda Butler has made a point 
of tailoring the game to ﬁ  t the skill set of her players. What was once a structured, low-block team is now fast-paced with an emphasis on the transition game. 
“We’re trying to build 
an offensive system that makes sense for all the tal-
ent we have and trying to give them the best chance to be hard to guard every 
single time down the ﬂ  oor,” Butler said. 
“We pride ourselves on being a transition 
team and trying to play up-tempo. That just means you’ve got to have ﬁ  ve people who understand space and can pass the ball. Added Bonds: “Last year our offense was 
more structured. This year we have a little more freedom. That ﬁ  ts with what players are able to do.”
Fortunately for Bonds, speed is a large 
part of her game. For as much as she was asked to do last season, she will be counted on for more as a senior.
“She set a very high standard for being 
the best leader that I’ve ever coached,” But-ler said. 
“The ﬁ  re that she brings, she backs it up 
with the way that she plays and in the con-sistency in how she practices.”
Senior point guard hoping to seize ﬁ  nal opportunity with Gators “Dumb penalties, 
penalties that are totally 
avoidable, those are the 
ones we can’t have and 
need to correct, and we deal 
with pretty matter-of-factly 
and harshly.”
