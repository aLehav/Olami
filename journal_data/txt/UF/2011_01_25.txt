KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Three teens 
accused of robbing motorists stuck in 
the snow have been caught after — you guessed it — they got stuck in the snow themselves.
Prosecutors announced robbery and 
armed criminal action charges Friday against 18-year-old Darion O. Page of Kan-sas City, a 17-year-old and a 16-year-old.
The Kansas City Star reported that po-
lice found the teens stuck in a snowdrift early Thursday morning.
The victims’ credit cards were among 
the items found in their vehicle.
Court documents say the 17-year-old 
denied participating in the robberies and told police that all he did was drive.
The documents say Page admitted be-
ing present, but he blamed the holdups on the 16-year-old. The Star says that teen de-clined to make a statement.

Less than two weeks after deciding to 
return to UF for his senior season, Janoris 
Jenkins was cited for possession of mari-
juana Saturday in Gainesville.
The star Gators cornerback, who was 
projected to be a first-round NFL draft pick if he declared himself eligible, was 
found rolling a marijuana cigarette in the bathroom of Status Nightclub, 17 SW First St. at 12:50 a.m. Saturday.  
Jenkins, 22, was charged with posses-
sion of less than 20 grams of marijuana, a 
misdemeanor. He was released after being 
issued a notice to appear. His court date is 
scheduled for Feb. 17. 
“We are aware of the incident with Ja-
noris Jenkins and will handle it internally at this time,” coach Will Muschamp said.
Jenkins is the first Florida football play-er arrested since Muschamp became UF’s 
head coach, who spoke during his introductory press conference about “the Florida way” regard-
ing off-the-field behavior. 
Urban Meyer received 
a great deal of criticism 
for the 25 players arrest-ed during his six seasons 
as the Gators’ coach.“There’s a certain thing that I’m going 
to refer to as the Florida way, and that’s 
the way they need to act, and that’s the 
way they need to represent our universi-ty,” Muschamp said in December. “I’m go-ing to demand that, and I think that you’ll 
understand in time that that’s something 
that’s very important to me.”
The citation is not Jenkins’ first brush 
with the law. He was arrested in May 2009, charged with affray and resisting arrest 
without violence, and tased by police. He Jenkins cited for possession of marijuana

By MORGAN WATKINS
Alligator Writer 
Four men wait in the front room for their 
names to be called. One leans against a wall, 
another sits in a chair. The woman in front shuffles paper, then calls one of the men for -
ward. 
“How was your day?”“How is school?”“How’s your new girlfriend?”She hands him a check from the state of 
Florida, his monthly stipend as a former fos-ter child. 
Another man comes in the door, says hello 
and heads toward the back office to chat with Rhonda Lockwood. As they catch up, the 
caseworker in the front room hands another 
person a check.
For these young men and women, this 
may be as close to a homecoming as they ever get. While some college students drive hours to go home on an occasional weekend, they show up on the first of the month, ev-ery month, to pick up a check from the state to cover their education and chat with the 
employees who have, in many cases, known 
them since they were 13 years old. 
Lockwood, 50, is the northwest regional 
coordinator at CDS Family and Behavioral Health Services Inc., which runs an indepen-dent living program for foster care children ages 13 to 23 that teaches them about time management, hygiene, financing and a host of other skills. 
She has seen children take their first steps 
into the world as adults, finally free of the system in which they were raised.
For some, she’s just an employee they 
see on occasion. For others, she is the closest thing to a parent they’ve ever had. 
Many kids learn about cashing checks and 
doing laundry from a parent. They learn to tie their shoes, ride a bike, throw a fastball, feed the puppy, clean the house, cook macaroni and cheese, drive a car, open a bank account and everything else in between
For children in the foster care system, 
there often aren’t any dependable adults to teach them these things. In fact, there are no 
parents.
She may not be a parent to the 250 or more 
kids she works with, but she’ll have to do.
***
Farron Sanders is new to adulthood. He 
moved into an apartment with his brother, 
19-year-old Darrius, on Oct. 15, the day he turned 18. For a boy who was bounced among foster homes from the time he was 8 
years old, it’s the first place that’s ever really 
been his — even if it is just a lease. He’s still getting used to the idea that he’s on his own.
Sometimes he calls Lockwood or drops 
by the CDS office to talk. Other times she just drops him a line to answer a quick question. Sometimes she drops Farron and his brother off at the grocery store. And sometimes, she drops everything to help him out.
Farron walks into the back room of CDS, 
where Lockwood sits at her desk talking to a caseworker. 
“Hey, Farron. What’s going on?” she asks 
him, running a hand through her short blond hair. 
“Lost my ID,” he replies. Without an ID, 
he won’t be able to cash his check. 
“Have you looked in your pockets? Your 
room? Under the couch?
“OK,” she says. “We’ll just have to get you 
a new one.” 
They’ll have to pick up his Social Security 
card from his apartment first. They’ve got a couple hours before offices close. She gets up, grabs her keys. 
Farron may be out of the program, but 
he’s not out of her sight. Although Lockwood’s job is to take care 
of the foster kids at CDS, she makes sure to take care of herself, too. She goes for walks, cooks healthy meals and takes a vacation ev-
ery three months or so to relax. 
Lockwood, who has never been married, 
lives with two labradoodles named Emmitt 
and Maude and a Havanese named Buster. While she has no kids of her own, she helped raise a couple of family members’ children during rough times. Her family’s history of alcoholism sometimes meant taking on the role of temporary guardian for a child. 
She took care of one boy, Tony, from age 
12 to 18, and cared for a girl named Ruth un-til she was 5. Now they are grown with their own families, but she knows they’ll call if they ever need help or friendly advice. 
Whether she’s caring for family members 
or the foster children at CDS, she is available to help with any of their problems. If she isn’t there when they run into trouble, she is al-
ways only a phone call away. 
Lockwood’s job is a hands-on, 24-hour-a-
day responsibility. Kids don’t have crises on a 
9-to-5 schedule. The big problems — they can happen at 11 at night or at 4 in the morning.
The only time she usually silences her cell 
phone is when she’s in a movie, and even then she calls another employee to let them know that she will be unreachable for a cou-
ple hours. On the drive to Farron and Darrius’ 
apartment, she  talks about everything with the two boys. They talk about previous foster care kids who are in prison, in college, preg-nant, married, missing, found, sad, happy. 
While some kids do become criminals 
or drug addicts, in her experience it’s not as widespread as some people believe.
They talk about the stupid things some of 
Rhonda’s charges have done — some silly, and some dangerous but darkly humorous. Farron mentions a friend of his named Curly who was involved with CDS.
“Isn’t Curly the one who shot himself in 
the foot?” Lockwood asks Farron and Dar -
rius
“In the leg,” they both answer simultane-
ously. 
“I was on vacation and he called me [about 
that],” Lockwood recalled.
There have been kids who have ventured 
down a dangerous path, and she hasn’t been able to help right away. Sometimes they just don’t want her help. 
“You can only go out to somebody’s house 
so many times and have them tell you to get lost,” she says. “You say, ‘OK, come see me when you’re ready.’ We’re kind of like the 
hand that feeds you — later.”
As the conversation drifts, Darrius asks 
if they want to hear an animal joke. She tells 
him to go for it.  
He says he was at the zoo on Halloween 
and saw a tiger. He was wearing a costume, so he jumped out at the tiger and scared it. 
“I said, ‘Hey, stop being such a ’fraidy 
cat.’”
Darrius starts to laugh as Lockwood and 
Farron chuckle slightly and sigh.  
***   
The key to the Lockwood job is resilience. When foster care children join the pro-
gram, it takes time to earn their trust. They’ve been spurned before by biological parents 
and foster parents, and they expect her to be 
no different.
She watches what she says around them. 
Every person has a different trigger. For 
some, calling an idea stupid is the same as 
saying they are stupid. A slip of the tongue can cause a rift, which she then has to mend.
Working with children at CDS is not par -
enting. There are limits she faces that parents don’t. For example, if a former foster care child wants to come with her on a trip to Tampa, they have to find a separate sleeping arrangement because they can’t stay in her 
hotel room overnight. 
She can’t shower them with gifts, although 
she does try to do something for them on spe-
cial occasions, whether it’s a birthday dinner or the small cookbook she gave to one of her CDS kids, Jessie, for her high school gradu-ation. 
Although she is not their mother, in many 
ways she thinks like one. She thinks about the children at CDS all the time. Maybe she sees a cool item in a store window that one boy might like. Maybe she hears a joke that might 
make one of them laugh. 
Everywhere, she is reminded of these chil-
dren.
One of her favorite memories is of taking 
three kids — Aaron, Dennys and Shelby — 
out shopping for outfits for Barack Obama’s presidential inauguration, which they were allowed to attend. 
They visited one thrift store after an-
other, and Lockwood watched excitement flash across their faces in each shop as they searched for the perfect outfits.
She teaches foster care children what she 
can before they age out. They learn about car maintenance, hygiene, checkbooks, cooking 
and more. 
After aging out, many still call her with 
questions or just to check in. They know she 
likes to cook, so they’ll come to her with cook-ing questions.
Watching them leave the system is tough 
because it means letting them figure things out on their own. 
“It’s a tricky little dance that we do,” she 
said.
Some won’t call for a while. Not knowing 
makes her nervous. If they need time to them-selves, that’s okay. She just needs to know that they are safe. 
She’s often one of the few adults who have 
really watched them grow up.
“You hope you’ve done a good job,” she 
said, echoing a favorite line of parents as their 
kids graduate from high school. “They’re go-
ing to do what they’re going to do.”
Even when her foster care children leave 
the system behind, they’re still connected. 
Andrea Houtman, a 21-year-old senior at 
UF, entered foster care at 11. She bounced be-tween homes with her older sister, Jennifer, now 23, and for a time lived with her young-er brother Todd, now 17, and older brother 
Danny, now 26. 
Social workers would show up at her fos-
ter homes late or not at all, wouldn’t follow 
protocol, and wouldn’t seem to care about 
her or her situation. She always thought that when she turned 18, that would be it. She 
wouldn’t be a “foster care kid” anymore. 
But after almost four years in college, she 
still visits CDS once a month to pick up her 
stipend and talk to Rhonda and the other employees. She glosses over her past with her roommates, choosing not to tell them she 
lived in foster care because of the uncomfort-
able questions it raises. 
When students complain about their mom 
calling too much or their parents always wanting to visit, she can’t relate. She would love to have those problems. She wonders what to tell a boy about her past when they go on a date. When he asks her about her mom, how does she explain that she doesn’t 
have one? 
CDS taught her many skills, although she 
had already learned plenty of them as a child 
growing up with an alcoholic father and a bi-polar mother, often fending for herself.
Because she was living in a supportive fos-
ter home, she didn’t need to rely on CDS as much as other children. 
But she liked how the caseworkers would 
always ask her how her day was, how school was, how life was. It made her feel like she mattered. 
***
Lockwood pulls up to the sidewalk in 
front of Farron and Darrius’ apartment. Far -
ron jumps out to get his Social Security card.
As Farron walks in the door, he heads 
past the living room filled with furniture and 
boxes. He’s still unpacking and ordering his 
new life, one box at a time. He grabs his card, heads out the door and walks to the office. 
As he walks in, Rhonda looks over and 
smiles. Someone in the laundry room found his ID. Crisis averted. 
But he still needs to cash his stipend check 
and could use some help — it’s his first in-stallment since he turned 18. 
Lockwood  checks the time. It’s only 3:30 
p.m. That’s enough time to drop by CDS quickly and then head to the bank. Then she’s packing up furniture and driving to an apart-ment that one of her previous foster care chil-dren just rented. 
Looking down the barrel of a long eve-
ning, Lockwood nods to Farron.
OK, she says. We’ll go to the bank before 
it closes. 4, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, JANUARY 25, 2011

TRADITIONAL BRAZILIAN MEALS TO RAISE MONEY.
  By DANIELA GUZMAN
 Alligator Contributing Writer
  
 The Brazilian Student Associa-
tion at UF is reacting quickly to 
the ﬂ  oods that hit Rio de Janeiro 
and the surrounding mountain-ous region of the country last week.
  In response to the  natural di-
saster, organizations around the globe are in the process of send-ing aid to the ﬂ  ood victims who are now reaching record num-
bers.
The latest ofﬁ  cial count by 
the Rio de Janeiro state prosecu-
tor’s ofﬁ  ce was 207 missing and 741 dead, according to a Reuters 
source. 
  That was last Wednesday.
  Now, BRASA is joining the 
collaborative effort by organizing 
a fundraiser and donation drive 
for Sunday.
  The event will be held at 1713 
NW Sixth St. from noon to 10 p.m. 
  For a $15 pre-sale ticket or a 
$20 at-the-door fee, BRASA will be preparing “feijoada,” a tradi-tional dish made of rice, beans and several native foods. 
  Weslley Albuquerque, charity 
director of BRASA, says feijoada has been a recreational tradition for the student association in past 
years.
It typically brings more than 
200 people together for food, mu-
sic and Brazilian culture.
  “I came to the U.S. in 2001,” 
Albuquerque said. “But Rio will always be my home.”
  Because of the torrential rains 
that have inundated a large part 
of his native city and other sur-
rounding towns, Albuquerque and the rest of the BRASA team are striving to collect non-perish-able food, hygiene products, bed 
linens, towels and ﬁ  rst aid for 
their fellow Brazilians. 
The ﬂ  ooding began after heavy 
rainfall on Jan. 11.

Welcome back 
to Gainesville, coach.
We can only imagine the 
nightmare of a migraine Will Muschamp got when he learned of Janoris Jen-
kins’ arrest for drug posses-
sion this weekend. 
Of course, we’re disap-
pointed whenever our local stars find themselves in the 
spotlight for the wrong rea-
sons, but we can begin to fathom the sinking feeling the new coach got.
Just a month ago, Mus-
champ told The Gator Na-tion that he was implement-ing a new plan to keep the university’s image clean 
and to hold players ac-
countable for their off-the-field actions.
Unfortunately, the time 
to test his new attitude came a bit earlier than ex-pected.
Jenkins has already cast 
a shadow on the “Gator 
Way” and caused his coach 
even more stress while Muschamp struggles with the incoming recruiting class in the days before Na-
tional Signing Day.
It may be difficult to 
break the string of the crim-
inal behavior of UF athletes, 
based solely on the impetus 
of history. 
After all, most of us can 
remember the names of at least a handful of arrested 
Gators. Need we bring up 
Carlos Dunlap?
While questions flew 
about how Jenkins would 
be disciplined by the team, 
a larger question formed in our minds: Why don’t our athletes play by the rules? Lead by Example
UPD odd choice for 
mental health training
We usually think of mentors as people whose ex-amples we’d follow to succeed. 
Members of the Council of State Govern-
ments Justice Center must disagree with us because they have selected our own University Police to mentor other departments on responding to people with mental health issues.
Maybe the center didn’t examine University Police’s 
reputation for handling delicate situations in a poor man-ner. 
You may recall a little incident in March when Univer -
sity Police shot a troubled graduate student, sparking out-
rage and eventually leading to an overhaul of the depart-
ment’s mental health policies. 
With less than a year under their belts after such an in-
cident, we question why, out of all the police departments 
in the nation, the center chose University Police as one of 
six sites that will host training sessions on law enforce-ment’s relation with mental health. 
Wasn’t there any other police organization available 
that lacked such an enormous blemish on its record?
In all fairness, perhaps the center decided the trying 
times University Police faced during and after the shoot-ing could serve as a non-example to others. After all, peo-ple fresh from fixing a problem may have some pertinent 
advice. 
If this isn’t the case, we truly fear for the well-being of 
our fellow citizens as police follow the example of a de-
partment undergoing a major change.
Coffee consumers pay for ambiance
There are few things on which I regularly spend an 
exorbitant amount of money. These items include 
gasoline, sushi, phone accessories and Starbucks 
coffee. I cannot recall when or where, but some blessed 
person once introduced me to those deliciously hand-
crafted beverages, and I have been hooked — and thus 
shelling out the big bucks — ever since. I’m such a suck-er for their overpriced products that they took pity and 
issued me a fancy gold card with my name on it that 
may as well scream, “I have spent a ridiculous amount of money here and am powerless to stop.” 
Despite the “rewards” my card gives me, I can see 
through my coffee goggles into their clever marketing technique, and how it keeps me coming back like the 
drone that I am. 
Until recently, as a loyal customer, I was in Starbucks 
every morning like clockwork, ready to do my part for the company. Steaming cup in hand I’d emerge, ready 
to battle the day. Lately however, I have been forced to cut back. I don’t have the funds to support my addic-
tion anymore, and my gold card is finding itself swiped 
much more infrequently. 
Instead of waking up 20 minutes earlier to wait in line 
at Starbucks, I wake up five minutes earlier and hit the button on the brewer. No special syrups, steamed milk, whipped cream, anything. Sounds horrific, doesn’t it? 
How can I possibly begin my day without a $5 beverage 
in a white and green cup? 
In the wake of this lifestyle change, I have come to 
a realization. It’s not the drinks I crave, it’s the experi-ence. I understand it’s hard to imagine the act of buying a cup of coffee as an “experience,” but think about it: 
entering the shop, smelling the aroma, seeing the famil-
iar items for sale on the chalkboard menu, the friendly baristas greeting you in their green aprons, so anxious to make you the perfect bever -
age. And need I even mention 
the coveted holiday cups and ac-
companying seasonal beverag-es? All of these things are what 
make the Starbucks experience, 
and they’re the reason why the corporation can charge such ex-
orbitant amounts. 
Starbucks has a niche for ev-
eryone, be it for the preteen girls giggling over frap-puccinos, stressed out college students gripping venti- 
sized cups, or young professionals hurriedly rushing down espresso before a big meeting. It is defined not by 
the beverage, but by the customers and feeling one gets 
when experiencing the product. 
The association that comes with the type of people 
who regularly visit Starbucks is what allows the com-pany to be so successful yet so overpriced. 
Of course the drinks are delicious, but are they as de-
licious if presented to you in a plain white cup? It’s not nearly as exciting if your double tall latte isn’t in the sig-nature cup with your name scribbled on the side, is it? 
I still enjoy the occasional fancy drink, but it’s just 
not practical to be a daily indulger. I am slowly learning to embrace my new morning coffee routine involving 
a simple coffee maker and some flavored creamer. As 
hard as I tried to be the Starbucks drinker, it’s just not economical. And sooner or later everyone will agree. 
For now, however, this corporate giant will continue 
to squeeze us dry as we obediently purchase overpriced mochas in search of the comforting familiarity Star -
bucks provides.

Carrying guns on campus unnecessary
The number of times firearms have been used to over -
throw a tyrannical U.S. government: zero.
The number of persons killed annually by firearms: 
30,000, according to a National Vital Statistics Report pub-
lished in May 2010.
Senate Bill 234, which would allow people with a con-
cealed weapons permit to carry a handgun in plain sight, 
is unnecessary and a menace. 
The mere thought of more guns on the UF campus is 
beyond comprehension to me.
While supporters of the Second Amendment contend 
that the right to bear arms is necessary for self-defense, I question how I am supposed to defend myself against 
gun-toting individuals. 
Furthermore, UF is home to two Baby Gator daycare 
centers. Is it necessary to put these children at risk for an 
antiquated, barbaric concept?
Must we continue to repeat the horrors of the Tucson, 
Virginia Tech, University of Texas’ bell tower shootings? 
It is time we realize that the Revolutionary War is over, 
and it’s time to lay down our arms.
Nicole Iovine
Assistant Professor at the UF College of Medicine

Firearms don’t belong near classrooms
State Sen. Evers’ proposal to allow guns on campus 
would be disastrous. 
Guns aren’t only a danger in the hands of criminals. According to the CDC, 15,698 people went to the emer -
gency room for gun-related accidents in 2007 alone, and 
613 died. Of the dead, the largest number among any age group — 155 — were between the ages of 15 and 24. 
I wouldn’t feel safe in class or on campus if people around me were openly carrying these dangerous and 
accident-prone weapons, and classmates possessing fire-
arms would be an intimidating challenge to free, open and respectful in-class debate. 
There shouldn’t be a risk of hospitalization or death 
just for being a student, and the Florida Legislature should 
allow college communities to decide for themselves what 
they want to allow on their premises.

Tucson tragedy not conservatives’ fault
Matthew Christ should be ashamed of himself, but instinct 
tells me he is probably rather proud. In the space of three sen-tences in yesterday’s guest column, he managed to label the 
Tucson shooter as ideologically conservative and try to wea-
sel away from the fallout. 
Christ is heir to a long Democrat tradition of blaming ev-
ery tragedy on conservatives to score political points — note 
Christ’s plug for UF College Democrats at the end of his 
piece.
It would be easy to point out Lee Harvey Oswald, John 
Kennedy’s shooter, was a leftist.  It would be easy to point out James Earl Ray, Martin Luther King Jr.’s killer, was a leftist. 
I could also shamelessly make the case Jared Loughner is 
a leftist because the Communist Manifesto was among his fa-vorite books. But after hearing what Loughner has said, the only ideology he subscribes to is psychosis. I would consider myself degenerate for trying to project anything more onto him for political gain.
Nevertheless, Christ brands decent Americans  as crazies 
for the errant actions of one man,  although he asks we not blame the entire Democratic Party for one congressman who wants to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine.  
I must agree with Christ, though: Democrats do not want to write and vote on legislation to make the media environ-ment “fairer” for their dying liberal message. They would rather pass their regulations by authoritarian decree through 
the FCC.
Because this is the end of my letter, I suppose I should pro-
mote something too: God bless the Republic.

Progressive programs overrated by left
In Monday’s guest column, Mr. Christ claims progres-
sive ideas have fared well in every intellectual arena, boast-
ing of such stallions as higher educational standards, social 
safety net programs and business regulations. 
His use of the modifier “intellectual” is especially fitting 
because in the arena of reality, these programs actually do very poorly. 
Indeed one might question to which programs he re-
fers.
The social safety net programs that he boasts have lifted 
millions out of poverty have done nothing of the sort. Pov-
erty rates trended strongly down until 1965, the year after 
President Johnson declared war on poverty. 
Maybe he means the educational standards that allow 
American students to increasingly lag behind the rest of the world, while simultaneously requiring ever more ex-travagant expenditures? 
Or maybe he means the business regulations that in-
crease operating costs, allowing larger firms to increas-ingly dominate smaller competitors who cannot afford to 
comply?
Such programs have unquestioned popularity in politi-
cal and intellectual circles, if only more attention was paid to their results.

The final countdown has be-
gun for the Gainesville Commis-
sion race.
At noon on Friday, the bal-
lot will be finalized and sent for 
printing. This means the five can-
didates running for the District 3 spot have three more days to pay the $304.03 qualifying fee and to fill out paperwork. 
The fee may be problematic 
for two candidates.
Ozzy Angulo said he won’t be 
able to pay the fee, so he’ll fill out 
a form that will allow him to con-
tinue without paying it. Angulo filed the same form when he ran for mayor last year.
“This is not something that I’m not going to allow to concern my team,” he said. “We’re not going to stop now.”
Currently , Angulo has raised 
$618.50.
Ramon Trujillo has not raised 
any campaign funds, but he has an appointment to complete his 
paperwork Tuesday morning. 
He said he also plans to fill out the fee waiver.
As of Monday afternoon, An-
gulo and Jimmy Harnsberger had also made appointments to finish their paperwork, said Pam Carpenter, Alachua County su-pervisor of elections. 
Susan Bottcher’s campaign 
manager, Eric Conrad, said they are ironing out some last-minute details and plan to be registered by Wednesday.
“There’s no question. Susan’s 
in this race,” Conrad said.
Rob Zeller, the lead fundrais-
er of the District 3 race, had not made an appointment, Carpenter said. He did not return voicemail requests for comment.
Carpenter said candidates 
without appointments can stop 
by her office to complete the pro-
cess. She said she doesn’t expect anyone to jump into the race this week, nor does she expect any-one to drop out, but nothing is certain until Friday at noon.Candidate qualifying begins
n THE SPEECH AIRS TONIGHT AT 9 P.M.

As President Obama presents his State of the 
Union Address today, UF student Dave Schneider wonders whether the speech will really matter. 
For Schneider, this may be just one more notch 
in Obama’s speaking career.
“In a lot of ways, the presidents use it to really 
try out a lot of empty rhetoric,” Schneider said of the annual speech. 
Schneider, a member of Students for a Demo-
cratic Society, has heard much talk but seen little walk during the first half of Obama’s presidency. 
“Barack Obama’s talked for two years about 
growing the economy ... and we really haven’t seen measures for that,” he said.
With the specter of unemployment haunting citizens’ wallets, Schneider worries that the State of the Union address won’t signal a commitment to effecting real change. He does hope Obama will use the speech as a platform to discuss important national issues, particularly the need to support or -
ganized labor unions.
While Schneider is skeptical of the impact of 
the address, UF political science professor Albert 
Matheny said it should help set the political agenda for the second half of Obama’s presidency.  
He expects Obama to focus 
on the economy and unemployment during the speech. The president may also address a need for 
more environmentally friendly industries, he said.
“He has been on the defensive since the No-
vember election, and now he’s in a position to go 
on the offensive and address issues in a positive and constructive way, in counterpoint to what has been happening in the new Congress,” Matheny said.State of the Union expected

Imagine you’re a teacher at UF. 
You teach what are considered to be some of the hard-
est courses in your college. Now, picture your students making tens of thousands dollars more than you when they graduate. 
Why would you stay in that career?Dave Small has one answer:
“I teach.”
But come the end of this semester, he won’t be able to 
do that at UF anymore. 
As a lecturer for the Department of Computer and 
Information Science and Engineering, Small’s teaching contract was not renewed like it had been in the past 11 years.
He didn’t understand. He said he would have under -
stood if it had been the last few years when money was 
tight in the college. 
“Mathematically, it does not add up to me,” he said.
Sartaj Sahni, the department chairman for the college, 
said it has nothing to do with finances. 
According to him, there were 1,700 undergraduates in 
2000 and now there are fewer than 570 in the college. 
When Sahni was asked who would replace the six 
classes Small teaches in the fall and spring terms, he said that the graduate-level professors would take over. 
He said that the $49,694 that makes up Small’s salary 
and one other unidentified faculty member will be used to hire one graduate-level professor. 
He did not explain why Small and the other were se-
lected to be dismissed. 
Tarif Kayali,  a second-year digital arts and science ma-
jor,  said he doesn’t know where he’d be without Small. 
“I thought it was just a rumor,” Kayali said. “I was 
completely shocked when it wasn’t.” 
So he and a few others started the movement known 
as “Save Dave!” The student-run organization is trying to keep their professor at UF. 
A website, savedaveuf.org, is open for anyone who has 
been taught or inspired by Small to tell their story.
Kayali said it’s hard to explain what Small means to 
the college, but can’t imagine what it would be like with-out him.
“Dave has a huge fan base,” Kayali said.Since he was very young,  Small has been around tech-
nology. His father was a physicist, so he was able to have an innovated and technologically driven childhood.  
“One of the cool things about computers is they are al-
ways changing,” he said. “You’re continually learning.”
After teaching at UF for a few years, the programming 
team asked him to be their coach.“I had no idea there was even a programming team,” 
he said jokingly.
This year, the team was first in the Western Hemisphere 
and 14th in the world in the IEEEXtreme 4.0 competition, a 24-hour programming marathon. 
Small said it’s a great experience for the students to 
have fun and do what they are passionate about.
“As corny as it sounds, you have to do what you love,” 
he said. 
Throughout his life, Small heard that there are people 
who are naturally born to teach. He always enjoyed help-ing others work on projects in high school and college.
As a graduate student, he became a teaching assistant. He remembered throwing the “naturally born to teach” 
phrase around once. 
On of his advisers replied, “You sound like one of 
them.”
Matthew Carroll is a first-year graduate student, but 
is taking undergraduate classes with Small because he 
considers them to be more valuable and harder than his 
graduate courses. 
Carroll said Small holds his students to high standards 
and puts them in real-life situations with deadlines and problem solving. 
“The way Dave teaches the class makes you want to 
work for it,” he said. 
While Kayali and Carroll agree that the college won’t 
fall apart without Small, they insist he is still an integral 
part of it.
“Nothing is based on one man,” Carroll said. “But this 
might be the exception to the rule.”
When Small found out that he would no longer be 
teaching at UF, he was stunned. 
So were many of his students when word spread of his 
soon-to-be departure. 
Kayali heard from Carroll, who had recently gradu-
ated. 
They decided to band together and try and stop what 
seemed inevitable. 
As of Tuesday night, there are 99 Facebook RSVPs to 
“Save Dave!” and dozens of testimonials on both that 
group and the website that explain how Small has made 
an impact on their life.
“[The show of support is] personally touching that 
there are students who care so much,” he said. 
There are those who think his teaching style is hard, but most say they benefited from it. 
But in the end, there is still just a disbelief in what is 
going to happen. 
So, from programming basics in his intro to program-
ming class to the digital arts class where students create 
video games, he is thanked for his hard work and pa-tience. 
“It’s very difficult to put into words — “ 
He paused and thought for a moment. “Extraordinari-
ly humbling. It’s extraordinarily humbling. It blows my 
mind.”
But Small said he has slowly come to terms and has 
begun looking toward the future. 
He doesn’t know what he’ll do if he can’t teach at UF 
or another university.
When asked why, he gave a similar answer:“Because, I teach.”TUESDAY, JANUARY 25, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 9

  A UF Police Department patrol car drives on campus Monday. UPD has been chosen to 
serve as a mentor to other police departments for mental health situations. 
UPD ofﬁ  cers shot a mentally ill student after a standoff last March
  The group of six departments, which in-
cludes the Los Angeles Police Department and 
the Houston Police Department, were selected from a national pool of applicants.
  “I think it recognizes the university for 
having a system in place that deals with its mentally ill,” UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said. “It represents that we have a good pro-cess for collaborating with student affairs, mental health counseling and wellness, as well as the UPD to help diffuse mental issues with our students, employees and faculty .” However, the selection is not without criticism and controversy.
  The UF Police Department was involved 
in a  much-publicized incident in March when UF graduate student Koﬁ   Adu-Brempong was shot in the face in his Corry Village apart-ment.
  Adu-Brempong, who required a cane to 
walk, was reported to have come at the ofﬁ  -cers with a metal rod after barricading himself in his apartment for two hours.
  The ofﬁ  cers reported they had attempted 
to subdue the 35-year-old with bean-bag shots and Tasers, but both failed. 
They then shot him twice with an AR-15 
assault riﬂ  e, sparking an investigation of the department, an uproar from students and an 
ofﬁ  cer’s dismissal. 
  Dave Schneider, a member of Students for 
a Democratic Society, spoke out against the 
department’s selection. 
  “The whole thing would be comical if it 
wasn’t absolutely horrifying,” Schneider said.Schneider was also critical of the organiza-tion’s response to the shooting, saying that he believes the organization requires oversight. 
“It’s like asking a biology student who failed 
the class to then get up and teach the class,” he added. 
  Sikes said that while the incident was 
a tragedy and an error, looking at only the shooting of Adu-Brempong is missing the big-ger picture.
  “The university deals with a lot of cases 
with its students, staff and faculty ,” she said. 
“This recognition is indicative that we have 
good policies and procedure in place, and that will help move us forward.”
  Calls to UPD for comment were not imme-
diately returned. UPD , from page 1n THE MUSEUM IS THE FIRST

 Ricky Carter, the incoming 
president of Pride Student Union at 
UF, classiﬁ  es himself as a “gender-queer, gay, drag queen.”
  Bridget Siegel, the vice president 
of outreach for PSU, describes her-self as non-heterosexual; she is still ﬁ  guring out her sexual identity.
  Both students, although at differ-
ent steps in their self-identiﬁ  cation, feel the same about one issue: A gay , lesbian, bisexual and transgender 
museum is a positive step for the LGBT community from Gainesville 
to San Francisco.
  The Gay Lesbian Bisexual Trans-
gender Historical Society opened The GLBT History Mu-seum on Jan. 13 in San 
Francisco. This is the ﬁ  rst museum in the United States, and only the 
second in the world, dedicated to educating the community on LGBT 
history, according to a media re-lease.
  Students do not need to travel 
all the way to San Francisco to learn about LGBT culture, according to A.C. Stokes, director of LGBT Af-fairs at UF.
  In addition to a library , UF has 
ﬁ  lms and offers other events for stu-dents to learn about LGBT culture. The school provides the extra infor-mation students need, Stokes said.
  Siegel said she feels the new mu-
seum accomplishes a goal that PSU holds dear.
  “One thing we focus on is the 
ability to have a voice,” she said. “This museum will give a voice for the people who couldn’t speak.” 
 Students say museum is good for LGBT community

When asked about the greatness 
of this season’s Southeastern Conference, Billy Donovan gave 
a somewhat surprising, yet enlightening, answer.
“I think that a lot of times when people 
define greatness, a lot of times they define 
greatness on what happens in the NCAA 
Tournament,” he said. “And I don’t think that’s necessarily always fair.”
So, how is greatness achieved?
“I think you have 
to define that over the whole entire course of a season,” Dono-van said.
If this is the case, 
the Gators aren’t too far from reaching that level.
Florida has won 
more than 20 games 
in the three seasons since it won its sec-ond consecutive national championship in 2007. 
It needs just six more victories this sea-
son to make it a fourth straight year. 
It has accumulated 85 wins since Joa-
kim Noah, Corey Brewer and Al Horford left Gainesville in 2007. That’s an average of about 21 wins a season.
All of those numbers are a sign of con-
sistency — not greatness. 
However, all of that doesn’t matter. 
The Gators are miles away from being considered great because of one glaring 
hole during the last four seasons: Florida 
has earned a trip to the NCAA Tourna-ment just once in that time. 
Its lone opportunity was gone in the 
blink of an eye as UF lost to BYU in double overtime in the first round last year.
The Gators took part in the NIT during 
the other two seasons.
I wouldn’t categorize this run as even 
close to great. 
Contrary to Donovan’s definition, a 
team becomes special only when it can By GREG LUCA

Although Florida currently sits atop 
the Southeastern Conference standings, 
its players feel like underdogs. 
The No. 24 Gators (15-4, 4-1 SEC) be-
lieve fans and the media have written them off after early losses and are look-ing to prove their doubters wrong as they travel to Athens to take on Georgia (14-4, 3-2 SEC) tonight at 7. 
“We understand that we have no re-
spect going into Georgia,” senior Chan-dler Parsons said Saturday. “Nobody gives us a chance to win.”
Although UF has returned to the 
national rankings and will face a team that is just 3-2 in conference play, the Gators see the Bulldogs as the heavy favorite entering the game.
Florida cites Georgia’s homecourt 
advantage as a cause for concern, even though Tennessee notched a win in Stegeman Coliseum just a week ago. 
“I would say nobody gives us a 
chance to beat Georgia,” Parsons said. “I think everyone thinks they’re a bet-ter team. I think everyone thinks they’re very tough at home, which they are.”
When the Gators open the newspa-
per or turn on ESPN, they are consis-tently met with talk of their wild in-consistency rather than their first-place 
start. 
They feel disrespected and over -
looked, and the latest SEC predictions 
have left the Gators with chips on their shoulders. 
“Just hearing people talk,” Boyn-
ton said. “We were probably watch-ing the game, the SEC games, and the announcers are saying stuff like, ‘We 
picked Kentucky No. 1, Vanderbilt two 
and Georgia three.’ Not even mention-ing us. 
“Us being No. 1 in the league, it’s 
kind of crazy, but I guess we’ve been an up-and-down team, so that’s how peo-ple feel. So, we’re going to try to prove them wrong.”
If the Gators are looking for reassur -
ance, they will find none from coach Billy Donovan, based on how he has spoken about the Bulldogs.
Three months ago, Donovan pre-
dicted Georgia would be the team to beat in the SEC. 
Now, with the first five games of 
conference play in the books and Flor -
ida leading the SEC East, he still feels 
the Bulldogs are as strong as any team 
in the league. 
“I am hard pressed to believe that 
they are unable to line up against any team in the country,” Donovan said. “If Georgia and (No. 1) Ohio State played a game on a neutral court, I think it would be an unbelievable game.”
At the SEC Men’s Basketball Me-
dia Day on Oct. 21, Donovan said he thought Georgia was “clearly” the best team in the conference. 
Donovan’s primary argument was 
that the Bulldogs returned two pre-season First-Team All-SEC players in 
Travis Leslie and projected SEC Player 
of the Year Trey Thompkins. 
Although the Gators were picked to 
win the conference and have started on the right path towards that goal, Dono-van is still wary of Georgia. 
“They have the ability to be a great 
team,” Donovan said. “I don’t think there’s any question.”Florida’s respect for Georgia and its 
feelings that it has been disrespected by the media have led to intense practices and a renewed focus. 
“I think guys are going as hard as 
they can every day now,” freshman center Patric Young said. “That’s the ef-fort coach wants from us.”
After weeks filled with unpredict-
ability and varying energy levels, the Gators have a new excitement and an-ticipation they think can ensure a strong showing against the Bulldogs. 
“We’re going into a hostile environ-
ment in Georgia playing a great team (on) national TV,” Parsons said. “I don’t know why guys wouldn’t be excited to play.”
TEEING OFF WITH ANTHONY CHIANG POLL QUESTION I DID NOT KNOW THAT
n Billy Donovan was selected as one 
of 14 coaches in the ESPN "Infiniti 
Coaches Charity Challenge." He has been in the lead since Friday, and his $100,000 prize would go to the Sebastian Ferrero Foundation.Today’s question: How will the Florida men's basketball team finish its season?n UF cornerback Janoris Jenkins was cited Saturday for possession of mari -
juana. I don't know what is more surprising, his decision to return for his senior season or the fact that this is the first football player to be arrested since Urban Meyer stepped down. ... The Cleveland Cavs lost their 17th straight game Mon -
day. Remember that curse Dan Gilbert placed on LeBron James and the Heat? I think he may have stuck it on his own team by mistake.Matt Tripp / Alligator Staff
Florida senior forward Chandler Parsons said Saturday he did not think anyone was giving the Gators a chance to beat Georgia tonight at 7 in Athens.

After two weeks of Southeast-
ern Conference play, the league’s 
hierarchy is nearly as muddled as 
it was on opening day. 
The balance so far has been 
unparalleled, as eight teams are 
within a game of .500 in confer -
ence action. 
No team reached 4-0, and only 
two stumbled to 0-4 starts. 
“Every night is very diffi-
cult and challenging,” Arkansas 
coach John Pelphrey said on a conference call. “It seems like ev-erybody in our league is competi-
tive and getting better.”
Said Mississippi State coach 
Rick Stansbury: “It’s one of two 
things: Either nobody is domi-nant, or there is a lot of balance.” 
So far, it appears to be a com-
bination of the two. 
Many of the conference’s most 
talented teams have also proved to be its most inconsistent. 
Stansbury said Georgia and 
Vanderbilt have been the SEC’s most steady teams to this point, but even they have suffered two conference losses apiece. 
Tennessee coach Bruce Pearl 
also noted that there is a lot of parity in the SEC. 
But, he added, every team in 
the East has the potential to step 
up and assert itself as the confer -ence’s best. 
LSU coach Trent Johnson es-
poused a similar opinion be-
fore adding that the Gators are perhaps the most likely team to 
make a move.
“If Florida’s healthy, most of 
the people I’ve talked to think they have a chance to make a lot 
of noise,” Johnson said. 
KENTUCKY FULL OF POTENTIAL: 
While Florida is Johnson’s pick 
to potentially win the confer -
ence, Kentucky coach John 
Calipari is still confident in his squad. 
Despite his team’s 3-2 SEC 
start, Calipari feels the Wildcats can be a major factor if they maxi-mize their talent. 
“I really like my team,” Cali-
pari said. “There’s no team in America that has the upside of this team.”
Calipari pointed specifically to 
two of his six freshmen, Brandon Knight and Terrence Jones, who are showing improvement after underperforming at times this 
season. 
Calipari cites Jones’ focus and 
desire and Knight’s ability to run 
the offense as areas of their game 
that are too inconsistent. 
“Individual players are play-
ing 50 or 60 percent of what 
they’re capable of doing, and they’re playing in spurts,” Cali-
pari said. “We have a good group 
of young men, and we’re excited about that. I just wish they were a little rougher and tougher.”
WEEKLY AWARDS: Knight was 
named the SEC Freshman of the Week after recording a combined 
37 points and 11 rebounds in the 
team’s two road contests — a loss to Alabama and a win over South Carolina.
Vanderbilt junior Lance Goul-
bourne was named the SEC Player of the Week. Goulbourne scored 29 points and snatched 
26 rebounds as the Commodores 
scored wins over St. Mary’s and Ole Miss.20, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, JANUARY 25, 2011

increased competition in the league. There were no 4-0 teams, and only two 0-4 squads, in the league.
“Every night is very difficult 
and challenging. It seems 
like everybody in our 
league is competitive and 
getting better.”
John Pelphrey 
Arkansas basketball coachsaid he was defending himself after a man attempt-
ed to pull a chain off his neck.
Following that arrest, Jenkins signed a deferred 
prosecution agreement, served probation and did community service to clear his record.
It was commonly assumed the three-year starter 
would forgo his senior season and enter the NFL Draft.
ESPN analyst Todd McShay ranked Jenkins as the No. 11 overall prospect in the draft class after he developed a reputation as a lockdown corner.
The 5-foot-11, 184-pound cornerback was the an-
chor of Florida’s secondary and at times the most reliable player on the field for the Gators.
Despite playing most of the season with a torn 
labrum in his right shoulder, he consistently shut down opponents’ top receivers, including South Carolina’s Alshon Jeffery and Georgia’s A.J. Green. 
Jenkins finished the 2010 season with three in-
terceptions and 43 tackles, playing in all 12 regular-season games.
He underwent surgery and did not play in UF’s 
Outback Bowl win over Penn State on Jan. 1. 
Less than two weeks later, Jenkins announced 
his decision to return to UF to work toward his de-gree and play the 2011 season. 
He will also rehab his shoulder and improve his 
draft stock for next year. TUESDAY, JANUARY 25, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 21

ONE OF THE TEAM’S LEADERS.

Already ranked No. 2 in the nation, the 
women’s tennis team will get a big morale 
and talent boost this week.
Sophomore Lauren Embree returns to 
the lineup after missing the fall with a wrist injury. As a freshman, Embree was the Gators’ top singles player and teamed with Joanna Mather to form one of the best 
doubles pairs in the country, taking down Stanford in the NCAA finals.
For a team that has seen shaky doubles 
play to start the spring, Embree’s return 
should lead to big improvements.
“She’s one of the toughest competitors 
you’ll ever see,” coach Roland Thornqvist 
said, “and that determination goes a long 
way when you play college tennis, with-
out a doubt.” 
Even though Embree and Allie Will are 
only sophomores, they are considered vet-
erans on a Gators squad that has no seniors 
and three freshmen. 
“Last year, our one-two punch was ri-
diculous,” Thornqvist said. “Just adding her in there makes me a better coach.”
STRONG START FOR MEN’S TEAM: The 
weekend could not have gone much bet-
ter for the No. 9 men’s tennis team as the 
Gators earned a 7-0 victory 
over Furman on Friday and 
downed No. 7 Baylor 5-2 on 
Sunday. 
Although it did not come 
easily, coach Andy Jackson 
was pleased with his team’s ability to per -
form under pressure in dual-match play. 
“One of the better things about the 
weekend was that we could show with some young guys that we could shift gears 
away from getting a nice point against doubles and go right back to work in sin-gles,” he said.
The team will look to build on its strong 
start as it hosts UC Santa Barbara on Fri-
day as part of  the ITA Kick-Off Weekend. 
The Gauchos will be tested when they 
come to Gainesville as they will have al-
ready played No. 21 Pepperdine and No. 6 UCLA.
“When they play us, it will be the third 
time they will have played one of the best teams in the country on the road,” Jackson said.Embree set to resume play following wrist injury

achieve success in the postseason. 
After all, the NCAA Tournament is the 
reason Donovan has been granted immunity 
through these empty years. 
His back-to-back titles and historic run 
with the ‘04s have won him a break from crit-
icism during this time — much like the one 
Urban Meyer’s success earned him during a 
five-loss year last season.
The '04s even earned their reputation with 
two championships. Tim Tebow cemented his legacy when he won a national title as 
UF’s starting quarterback.
People don’t remember regular-season 
success.
They remember the team that captured 
the country’s attention with a deep postsea-
son run.
Don’t be fooled by Donovan’s comments.Tonight’s game against Georgia, and UF’s 
tough nonconference slate do not define this 
year’s team that began the season ranked No. 
9. 
Fans must wait until March to find out 
what this squad is made of and if that rank-
ing was justified.
Florida is no stranger to regular-season 
success, but postseason success is foreign to 
Donovan’s teams lately. 
There is nothing, so far, that sets this team 
apart from the recent ones that ended their years watching teams with which it was once mentioned alongside (Kentucky, UCLA, Connecticut and Duke) advance deep into 
the tournament — and I’m not talking about 
the NIT.
Inconsistency marked by losses to teams 
such as Jacksonville and UCF, and wins against quality opponents like Kansas State and Xavier, have fans and analysts guessing on just how great this team can be this sea-son. 
Instead of gaining hope with every win 
while considering the season a lost cause with every loss, wait a couple of months to do that.
Nobody will know whether this Gators 
team is special until it does something that has not been done since their last champion-ship — win in the NCAA Tournament.ANTHONY , from page 19

Three: The Georgia 
trio of Trey Thompkins, 
Travis Leslie and Gerald Robinson average a com-
bined 46.2 points and 17.1 
rebounds per game. UF coach Billy Donovan said each player demands a double team and can score in a variety of ways. “They have a lot of different weapons, so going in there will be a great challenge,” Donovan said. “There’s a lot for us to get prepared for.”Florida-Georgia Men’s Basketball

Defending Thompkins:  
The junior forward was 
named the preseason 
SEC Player of the Year and has lived up to the hype so 
far. Thompkins has estab-
lished himself as a dominant scoring presence in the post and has also shown the ability to score from outside, connecting on nine threes so far this year. “Thompkins is as good as any frontcourt player in the country, he’s terriﬁ  c,” Donovan said.
 Defending Leslie: 
The junior guard, who 
Donovan described as a 
slasher, has the ability to use a screen or cut to the basket 
for easy scores. Donovan is in-
structing his help-side defend-
ers to be alert to his presence. Leslie has the rare combination of speed, leaping ability and just enough of a three-point shot that makes him a serious scor-ing and rebounding threat. “He’s just a freak,” senior Chandler Parsons said. “I think he’s the most athletic guy in college basketball.”Defending Robinson:  
The addition of the ju-
nior guard and Tennes-
see State University transfer has solidified Georgia’s 
big three. Robinson gives 
Georgia another three-point shooting threat and a strong ball-handler, as he leads the team with 76 assists. Donovan said he has to make sure his team provides help when Robinson is involved in the pick and roll to make sure it does not give up any open threes.
Teamwork Key for 
Bulldogs: Georgia leads the SEC in assists 
at 16.4 per game. Its ability to work as a team has greatly improved with the addition of Robinson and another year of familiarity with coach Mark Fox’s system. “Our under-standing of how we’re trying to play has improved,” Fox said. “We have a pretty good understanding of what the guys next to us can do and we’re usually trying to make an extra pass to get a guy his shot.”Thompkins

Florida junior swimmer Shara Stafford, third from the left, was not able to 
receive clearance to travel and compete in Friday’s meet at Auburn.
By JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Writer
 
A little more than a week ago, 
Shara Stafford’s outlook for the 
season looked bright. 
After dealing with a freak 
occurrence of almost fainting in 
the pool against Georgia Tech 
on Jan. 7, the All-America swim-mer won the 200-yard freestyle against Florida Atlantic just eight days later.
Stafford, a junior, said after 
the race all her tests and doctors’ appointments stemming from her condition were over, and she 
could get back to racing.
She was unable to receive 
clearance to travel and com-
pete Friday at Auburn, leaving doubts about her health and how the Gators can replace her.“Shara’s had some medical is-
sues that she’s working with the doctors, and they haven’t cleared her at the moment because our No. 1 concern is to make sure that she is healthy and that there is no threat to her well-being,” coach Gregg Troy said.
Troy said 
the tests 
S t a f f o r d ’ s 
doctors are currently run-ning are “car -
diology re-
lated,” and he is pretty confident she will be back this season.
Until then, Troy will have to 
rework the lineup to substitute 
one of his best upperclassmen 
on a team with one senior, diver Monica Dodson. 
Stafford’s participation is also critical for all four of Florida’s re-
lay events to be successful when 
the team competes in the South-eastern and NCAA Champion-ships in February and March. She has been a part of a team-high six wins this year and has also contributed to the four fast-est relay times the Gators have had all season.
Without her help on the road 
against the Tigers, her teammates were not able to manage a single relay victory.
“When you take her out of the 
meet lineup, we get a real jug-gling match,” Troy said. “We’re a little bit slim, numbers-wise. If we move her, we’ve got to move 
three other people to places 
where they’re not quite as good to make sure we can cover for losing her.” Stafford works with doctors,

Immediately after the last round of the 
fall season, coach Buddy Alexander held a 
team meeting and told his golfers to take a week off — two, if they needed it. 
When he finished talking, three of his 
players went to the other end of the driving range to continue perfecting their games. 
“I wouldn’t even have to have practice 
and they’d be out there,” Alexander said.
It’s that type of dedication that has Alex-
ander only slightly surprised at his team’s early accomplishments. 
Despite losing its two best players from 
a year ago, Florida enters the spring season 
as the No. 3 team in the country after three 
consecutive top-three finishes in the fall. “I really wasn’t sure what to expect from 
this season,” Alexander said. “But we’ve had a couple guys step up.”
The Gators posted a record-breaking 
score in a win at the Olympia Fields Invi-
tational to open the year. They followed it 
with a second-place showing at the Jerry Pate Invitational and a third at the Isle-worth Invitational in Orlando. 
“We’re moving in the wrong direction,” 
Alexander said, smiling coyly. “Neverthe-less, anytime you can play an entire semes-ter and not be out of the top three — that’s pretty good.”
It is even more impressive considering 
the Gators’ starting lineup routinely fea-tures three sophomores in Tyler McCum-ber, Phillip Choi and Tommy Mou.  
McCumber wasn’t a part of Florida’s top five last season and appeared in only 
three tournaments as a Gator. After post-
ing a 71.7 scoring average and two top-10 finishes this season, he is now ranked among the top-20 players in the nation and 
is considered to be one of UF’s best. 
However, the Gators 
are also aided by the presence of two senior 
stalwarts in Bank Vong-
vanij, the No. 2 player 
in Golfweek/Sagarin’s individual rankings, and Andres Echavarria. 
It was Vongvanij’s career-best 207 (70-
67-70) at Olympia Fields that propelled the Gators to victory, and his 208 (66-71-71) at the Jerry Pate Invitational showed he is capable of consistent play atop Florida’s 
lineup. 
But Alexander said the extended gap be-
tween the fall and spring, which is longer 
than the gap between the NCAA Cham-pionship and the start of the fall season, makes it difficult to carry any momentum forward from the Gators’ early success. 
“I think it’s great to play well in the 
fall and, hopefully, gain a little confidence 
from that,” Alexander said. “But realisti-
cally, that’s a long time ago.” 
Fresh off the long layoff, the Gators’ 
path only gets more difficult. They travel to Ponte Vedra Beach Monday to play in the JU Invitational at the TPC Stadium Course at Sawgrass, home of The Players Champi-onship, and one of the toughest courses in America.

Swimmingn UF HAS STOPPED PRESSING TO 
FOCUS ON HALF-COURT SETS.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer

Last year, a lack of depth forced the Gators 
to shy away from the full-court press that 
proved effective early in the season.
With a deeper bench and full complement 
of players, it seemed as if UF would imple-ment the press more often this year, but that has not been the case recently . 
Donovan said the Gators focused more on 
their half-court defense against Auburn and Arkansas last week in an attempt to exploit the teams’ offensive weaknesses. Against Georgia tonight, however, Florida will look to press more often.
“There are certain teams that really thrive 
in open-floor situations,” coach Billy Dono-van said. “Then, there are a lot of teams that are going to play really , really slow, and you know the game’s going to get really, really locked into the 50s and we say , ‘OK, we need to press to speed the tempo up.’”
YOUNG MAKING TRANSITION:  Freshman 
Patric Young has had to acclimate his game to the college level in plenty of ways 
so far this season, but perhaps the hardest adjustment has simply been not being the biggest player on the floor at all times.
The 6-foot-9, 245-pounder has grown 
more comfortable during the season, and he 
has seen his playing time increase. Young has averaged 19.6 minutes, 5.4 points and 4.6 
rebounds per conference game while provid-
ing a spark off the bench.
“I think I’ve got exactly what coach wants 
me to do out there,” Young said. “Things are just flowing right now, and hopefully I can keep it up.”
MURPHY STILL RECOVERING: Erik Murphy 
returned to the court in both games last 
week after sitting out since Dec. 31 with a 
right mid-foot sprain, and the sophomore forward is slowly regaining his old form. 
Murphy was held scoreless but grabbed 
three rebounds in six minutes Thursday at 
Auburn. He managed six points and three 
boards in 13 minutes Saturday . Donovan said Murphy was “100 percent physically” but still showed signs of rust.
“He looks almost a step slow to me,” 
Donovan said. “It seems like he’s behind in plays. We definitely need him going forward because I think he’s a guy that can stretch the defense and shoot it.”24, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, JANUARY 25, 2011

Gators look to use press to speed up tempo vs. BulldogsBy TYLER JETT

Perhaps no position in Florida’s 2011 class has been struck 
harder by Urban Meyer’s departure than the offensive line, 
but new coach Will Muschamp and his staff are scrambling to reverse their misfortunes late in the recruiting game.
With National Signing Day a little more than a week away, 
the Gators coaches pitched their program’s future to Traverse City (Mich.) West High three-star offensive tackle Jacob Fisher during his official visit last weekend.
After struggling to recoup from Meyer’s resignation on 
Dec. 8, the Gators may actually be benefiting from a coaching change. Fisher, who orally committed to Michigan last sum-mer, opened his recruitment after the Wolverines fired coach Rich Rodriguez.
“The whole thing, really , is really a funny 
business sometimes,” West High coach Tim Wooer said. “You think you have your fu-ture planned, and then everything changes just like that.”
Following Rodriguez’s firing, Wooer 
contacted several schools, including Flori-
da. The day after he e-mailed Fisher’s high-
light tape to the Gators, Wooer received a 
call from new offensive line coach Frank 
Verducci.
Fisher is interested in UF, Michigan State and Oregon, 
Wooer said, and Michigan is still in the hunt. New Wolverines coach Brady Hoke has talked on the phone with Fisher, and offensive line coach Darrell Funk tried to lure him back during an in-home visit. Wooer expects Hoke to visit West High on Thursday.
Regardless of where he chooses, Fisher will not make an im-
mediate impact, ESPN recruiting analyst Craig Haubert said. At 6-foot-7 and 270 pounds, Fisher has impressed scouts based on potential, but he needs to bulk up and refine his technique.
Fisher plays tight end, defensive end and punter at West 
High, so he is inexperienced at offensive tackle.
“He’s a redshirt-type kid,” Haubert said. “He does a lot of 
things for his high school team, but I don’t think he’s ready for elite college football. You hear about these kids who are ready to help a program their freshman year. He’s not one of them.”
Fisher will take an official visit to Oregon this weekend. Former Michigan commit Fisher interested in Florida
