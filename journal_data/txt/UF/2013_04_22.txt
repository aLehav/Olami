 The Gators were not ﬁ  nishing second again this year. 
  After falling 0.075 points short of winning the 2012 na-
tional title, Florida clinched its ﬁ  rst NCAA championship on Saturday in Los Angeles. UF joins Georgia, Alabama, Utah and UCLA as the ﬁ  ve schools to win a national title 
in gymnastics. 
  “It has been years in the making, and everyone trusted 
what we were doing at Florida and they believed in us,” 
coach Rhonda Faehn said. “This was the next goal, to break into that ﬁ  nal four schools that have won.”
  With a score of 197.575, Florida edged Oklahoma by a 
margin of 0.2. Alabama placed third with 197.35 points. 
  The Gators kicked off the evening with its thinnest ro-
tation — balance beam. Florida recorded a 48.875 — the 
team’s lowest score since posting a 48.525 in a 196.975-
196.075 win against Kentucky on Feb. 22. 
  Missteps from Ashanee Dickerson and Kytra Hunter 
resulted in the Gators falling behind early during their ﬁ  rst rotation. But Bridget Sloan and Marissa King helped Florida rebound to ﬁ  nish its ﬁ  rst routine despite a rela-tively low score. 
  The Gators produced better results during the ﬂ  oor 
event. Only Jamie Shisler scored lower than a 9.9, and UF 
bounced back from its poor performance on beam. 
  Sloan, King and Bridgette Caquatto pinned scores of 
9.95, and Hunter capped the rotation with a 9.975. Hunt-
er’s score gave Florida the highest mark on the ﬂ  oor in NCAA history.  FAEHN-TASTIC

Wayne Wheeler’s trailer has been 
empty for more than a week now.
He threw out all his furniture and 
has been staying with friends and fam-
ily since his three pet raccoons — Sis-
ter Rikki, Eli and Sheba — were taken 
from him April 12 to test for rabies af-ter Sheba scratched a woman in a But-ler Plaza Publix parking lot.
The same day they were taken from 
him, test results revealed all three rac-coons were rabies-free. It took the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conserva-tion Commission a week to notify 
Wheeler.
“I’m pretty upset,” the 47-year-old 
said Saturday. “They didn’t have to 
kill my raccoons. These things are like babies to me.”
The raccoons received rabies vac-
cinations in August, according to shot records from a local veterinarian.
However, because the raccoons 
are wild animals, the vaccination isn’t proven to work, said Anthony Dennis, 
director of environmental health at the 
Alachua County Health Department.
“The science behind providing vac-
cines is only established in dogs, cats and ferrets, and some other domes-ticated animals like horses,” he said. “And in terms of raccoons and opos-sums, it just has not been established 
that that is a protective measure that 
reduces rabies in that population.”
Dennis said because of photos and 
testimony from other people about Euthanized raccoons 
found to be rabies-freeCAMPUS

University Police evacuated North Hall 
on Friday afternoon after a suspicious pack-
age was found in the ﬁ  rst ﬂ  oor lounge.
UPD spokesman Maj. Brad Barber said the 
building was evacuated out of precaution.
“At no time was there no consideration 
that there was an explosive,” he said.
University Police received information 
at about noon after a housekeeping staff member found three test tubes ﬁ  lled with an 
unknown substance bound together in the 
kitchen.
Barber said the substance was removed by 
UF Environmental Health and Safety staff.He said the evacuation was a “totally dif-
ferent matter” from the incident that hap-pened at Keys Residential Complex earlier Friday morning.
UF biology freshman Gabriel Garcia was 
in the lounge doing homework around 11 a.m. when a housekeeping staff member asked him what was on top of the towel dis-penser.
Garcia, 19, described the test tubes as three 
8-inch clear tubes about the size of a quarter in diameter. 
They were stacked like a pyramid with 
duct tape wrapped around them. 
The tops were closed with plugs.“I could only see the bottom of the test 
tubes,” he said. “The liquid was clear like water.”
Police had no leads on who the test tubes 
belonged to.
“We always have to err on the abundance 
of caution,” Barber said.

search for Mr. Right. Adorable Blaine (Nicholas Downs) can’t seem to meet guys, let alone 
form a relationship. His beefy 
go-go boy roommate Cameron, who has no shortage of will-ing partners, can’t understand why Blaine doesn’t just pounce

downright confusing. For more

Recurso
Recurso is an international hu-manitarian organization at UF 
that strives to promote aware-bow and stern. Wooden beams 
crisscross overhead. A donated, life-size elephant statue stands 
sentry in front of the ark.
Unlike, say, biblical times, you 
need permits and zoning approval 
to build such a thing. Code en-forcement has dinged them with 
some violation notices.
Almira and his friends remain 
undeterred, committed to finish-
ing the 500-foot-long structure, dubbed Hidden Ark.
High on zeal and short on cash, 
they estimate it will cost $1.5 mil-lion to finish the ambitious proj-ect, which they say will include a museum, a shop and a small zoo 
with goats, pigs, chickens and oth-
er small animals, as well as stray 
dogs and cats.
Almira, who makes his living 
installing natural stone in homes 
and businesses, first approached 
Reniel Aguila with the idea. Agu-
ila, a truck driver, pitched it to his friends Manuel Guerra and Osmar Oliva. Oliva, owner of a trucking 
company, didn’t need much con-
vincing before donating $300,000 
to start putting hammer to nail.
Despite no formal engineering 
training, Aguila drew up rough plans based on the instructions God gave to Noah in the Bible.
The men tried to raise money 
through an Internet-based fund-raising campaign, but that hasn’t gone particularly well. Earlier this month, they’d snagged $644.
The four have crossed paths 
over the years through their work but were never especially close un-til the ark project gave them com-mon cause. Their families have been supportive.
“They told me to follow my 
dream,” Almira said.
Almira sees his ark as a place 
where people of all faiths could pray or meditate, a space where animals could interact with guests, and an after-school program.
“It has nothing to do with any 
specific religion,” he said.
Ultimately, Aguila envisions 
having people from across the globe join Hidden Ark, of assem-bling a membership roll so large it would keep admission to the ark free and still cover the cost of the operation, including an on-site 
veterinarian and a restaurant.
“This isn’t just for the commu-
nity,” he said. “It’s for the entire 
world.”

Miami men building modern ark 
MIAMI — In the beginning, 
there was the great flood. Not 
the one in Genesis that cleansed the world of evil but the rising waters that swamped the Gulf Coast during Hurricane Katrina.
As survivors and aid workers 
coped with the death and dev-astation, animals struggled, too. They foraged for food and wan-dered in search of a home.
Those images touched some-
thing deep inside Rodolfo Alm-ira. He dreamed of creating a refuge for animals facing catas-trophe. Then it came to him:
“Wouldn’t it be nice to do 
what Noah did?”
And why not right here on 
the rugged western frontier of Miami-Dade?
It could be a draw for tourists, 
a haven for God’s creatures, a testament to his faith, and a place for reflection and learning.
So it came to pass that Almira 
and three other Hialeah men began building an ark just west of town, doing it from a biblical template, converting cubits — roughly the distance between the elbow and the tip of the middle finger — into modern measure-ments.
It rises on a five-acre plot sur-
rounded by lakes that got their start as rock quarries, a moon-scape where work boots quickly get caked with dust kicked up by the trucks that constitute most of the local traffic.
Six months into their quest, 
the lowest deck of the three-story wooden ark is nearly complete. Planks of wood jut out near the MONDAY, APRIL 22, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 3

A newly formed choir began giving students cred-
it for their work. The Lee Bailey Choir, an all-black group, had to ask the music department for some form of academic compensation. Officials evaluated 
the group and found the request reasonable because 
it had changed from a casual singing group to a full-fledged choir group.
April 24, 1985More than 200 students and faculty marched down 
West University Avenue with signs that read “Stop the River of Blood.” Led by the College Democrats, Black Graduate Student Organization and Commu-
nity Prisoners Action group, the group rallied on the 
Plaza of the Americas and marched across campus in protest of UF funding companies doing business in South Africa. 
April 22, 1993“FBI, ATF, killing Christians right and left” was

Two Gainesville residents bound for Hawaii are turning 
to social media to find a home for their 2-and-a-half-year-old duck named McIntosh .
On April 12, Julie Zill and her boyfriend, Felipe Carvalho, 
posted a YouTube video of their downy friend.
The video shows McIntosh flying on command, swim-
ming in a backyard pool, eating table food and sleeping with his beak resting on Carvalho’s hand.
Within three days, the video had more than 175,000 views. 
As of press time, it had been watched almost 373,000 times.
Zill, a 25-year-old UF alumna, said she and Carvalho, 31, 
are trying to adopt out the duck because of necessity: She will attend graduate school at the University of Hawaii while Carvalho prepares for a job on the island. In anticipation of 
their summer move, the couple used the Internet, which in-
cluded posting the video on Facebook and Reddit, to show-case McIntosh’s personality.
“We raised him since he had first hatched, so we’ve al-
ways been very attached to him,” said Zill, who brought the duck home from a farm in Webster, Fla., as a two-hour-old chick.
Carvalho said McIntosh’s background makes him more 
adoptable. Most ducks don’t have the familiarity with hu-
mans McIntosh does, he said.
“He loves interacting with humans,” he said. 
Hawaii has strict regulations that would prevent McIn-
tosh from travelling with the couple, Zill said.
The couple said they have received a significant amount 
of interest from Gainesville-area residents about adopting Mcintosh, but they have not chosen a family for him yet.
“We want to review many options,” Zill said. “The search 
is by no means closed.”

� STATE RECEIVED THE MONEY.

Because of a system coding error 
in Gator Dining Services, unnecessary 
taxes have been attached to food items for the past two and a half years.
Lionel Dubay, assistant vice presi-
dent and director of the UF Business Services Division, said the added tax was probably set in place when the Provisions on Demand Market opened about two and half years ago.
Chris Mott, a first-year UF leader-ship development graduate student, first noticed the additional tax about 
two months ago in the Hub’s P.O.D. 
Market. Knowing general grocery items cannot be taxed in the state of Florida, Mott emailed Gator Dining Resident District Manager Bill Zemba.
In an email response, Zemba said he 
would consult with taxing experts to get a determination.
Dubay said the error came from the 
P.O.D Market’s point of sales system and has been resolved.
“It’s relatively an easy fix,” he said.
Dubay said all of the money col-
lected from customers, including the 
amount that was taken in error, was paid to the state by Aramark, the pri-mary food service on campus.
UF economics professor Jonathan 
Hamilton said because Aramark sent all of the money to the state instead of separately calculating its liability, the 
error was therefore unintentional.
“Their mistake cost students, but it 
benefited the state,” he said.

A beginning-of-the-year 
spike in business sent some 
Gainesville gun shops and shooting ranges scrambling to find ammunition. However, 
after the U.S. Senate voted 
Wednesday against legislation that would have required back-ground checks for gun pur-chases, banned military-style assault weapons and limited  the size of ammunition maga-zines, local businesses could be brought back to normal.
Jake Kennedy, the owner 
of Gator Skeet and Trap Club, said the effects of the decision may not be immediate.
“It’s a good thing in the long 
run,” he said. “In the short run, it has no effect. We’re still find-ing it hard to get ammunition. Prices are artificially high be-cause the demand is so high.”
Kennedy said the Boston 
Marathon attack may prolong the scramble for ammunition. 
Tyler Marzella, a 23-year-
old UF agricultural operations management senior and presi-dent of Students for Concealed Carry at UF, said the legislative decision should help make buy-ing supplies easier.
“Hopefully ... we can get 
back to a normal supply and demand,” he said.

Wheeler is working to get a lawyer, wants to change rabies laws
possible exposure to the raccoons, all three 
had to be seized, euthanized and decapitated to test parts of the brain for the virus.
“It is a very unfortunate and sad turn of 
events,” he said, “but we have to be 100 per-
cent sure because there is no cure for rabies.”Carlos Romero, a UF College of Veterinary 
Medicine research professor, agreed with the health department’s decision.
Romero said scientists don’t know as much 
when it comes to the rabies vaccination in wild 
animals. Depending on the animal and the point of contact, the incubation period could last up to a few years, and once the virus kicks in, there is no cure, he said.“There are so many variables that if there’s 
a human life at risk, you really don’t want to 
take any chances,” he said.
The only reliable way to test for rabies in an 
animal is through euthanasia and test samples 
collected from the brain, Romero said.
“It’s a shame that at the end of the day, the 
animals got destroyed,” he said, “but what can you do?”Looking forward, Wheeler said he’s work-
ing with a friend to secure a lawyer, adding 
he wanted to work with the Florida Fish and 
Wildlife Conservation Commission to change laws related to rabies testing.
“I really don’t know what’s going to hap-
pen,” he said. “I just want a normal, peaceful life.”

Maj. Thomas Sanders takes a break with fellow Civil War re-enactors at the 7th Florida 
Infantry Regiment Muster at Dudley Farm Historic State Park on Friday morning.

NEWBERRY — The bugle rang 
through the early morning. 
Soldiers, clad in Civil War uniforms, 
emerged from their tents and huddled 
around the campsite trying to stay warm.
As 1st Sgt. Walter Cook took out a list 
of names, the men stood at attention next to their tents and tried to wipe the sleep off their faces.
Cook, 23, of Webster, Fla., called roll, 
and shouts of “here” or “sergeant” echoed 
down the line.
These are the soldiers of the 7th Flori-
da Infantry.
Thirty-five re-enactors brought his-
tory to life by participating in the Dudley 
Farm Historic State Park’s 7th Florida In-fantry Regiment Muster this weekend.
The three-day-long re-enactment 
event depicted an April 1862 gathering 
when North Florida citizens formed a 
unit under P.B.H. Dudley Sr., a captain with the Confederate Army.Kaleb Williams, 20, of Yulee, Fla., has 
been re-enacting for six years. Portraying a musician for the infantry, he played the fife and snare drum during the event.
“The skills you possess might not 
necessarily go to another individual or 
person,” he said. “Every person has their 
own unique talents to bring to the hob-by.”
The weekend featured musket and 
cannon firing demonstrations as well as 
saber and bayonet drills. Women wore 
cotton dresses as they sewed medical 
bandages, created lint for injuries as well as for fire starters and made clothing kits, which would have been sent to soldiers 
on the battlefield.
Brian “Biscuit” Butler, 32, of Yulee, 
Fla., has been re-enacting historical bat-
tles and visiting Civil War battlefields since he was 13 years old. 
His love for history continues to draw 
him back to the front lines.
“It’s not a hobby for me,” he said. “It’s 
a lifestyle. “

The rain and cold weather couldn’t 
keep Miranda West away from breaking 
a world record. She and about 50 other local parents attended the Great Cloth Diaper Change on Saturday at West-
side Park as they attempted to break the 
Guinness World Record for the most cloth diapers changed at one time.
The event started with each partici-
pant paired with one child. They joined 6,500 people and counting from across the world, trying to break last year’s re-cord of 8,251 diapers. The results from this year will be announced Friday.
West, a 29-year-old Gainesville 
resident, said she decided to attend the event with her husband and two chil-dren, adding the event was a good way to raise awareness about cloth diapers’ positive effect on the environment.
“I get a strange sense of enjoyment 
seeing diapers on the [clothing] line,” she said.
Michelle Neilson, co-host of the event 
and co-leader of Cloth Diaper Enthusi-asts of Gainesville, said the organization made $222 from raffle tickets and dona-tions. After the organization deducts the cost of the event, it will donate money to

UF student Brianne Bradford questioned if 
she was dying the night she had food poison-
ing two years ago after eating paella, a Spanish dish composed of seafood and rice.
Bradford, a 23-year-old psychology junior, 
said for 24 hours, she experienced flu-like symptoms.
Bradford was not alone. Food poisoning is 
on the rise in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s survey of foodborne illnesses.
Campylobacter, a type of bacteria found in 
chicken and unpasteurized milk and cheese, is becoming more common. Salmonella  is the 
most common cause of food poisoning.
Anthony Dennis, director of environmental 
health at the Alachua County Health Depart-ment, said as of this year, the department has 
not had to investigate any facilities for food-borne outbreaks.
He said if the health department gets mul-
tiple complaints from the same establishment, they would have to investigate.
“We go out there as a health department to 
track it down and see where it came from and if there is a risk,” Dennis said.
Janis Mena, a registered dietician at the UF  
Student Health Care Center, said food poison-ing can occur from two to four hours or up to 12 hours after eating.
“It depends on the severity and the bug,” 
she said.
The best way to avoid most foodborne ill-
nesses, she said, is to wash your hands.
“We can cause them ourselves,” Mena said.Food poisoning getting frequent

52 TOTAL VOTES52% YES

We’re all with you, 
Boston 
“We must build a civilization of love or there will be no civili-
zation at all,” Cardinal Sean O’Malley said during a special service for the victims of the bombings at last week’s Boston 
Marathon, according to an article by the Boston Herald.
“We are all scattered in the pain and horror of this week’s 
violence,” he said in an article by CNN about the service. “Some of those here were among those injured. But everyone has been affected.”
Today marks one week since the bombings took place. One 
week ago today, the suspected bombers took the lives of three people and injured more than 170 others.
“There were other services Sunday in Boston,” continued 
the article. “Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders gathered for an interfaith service on Boylston Street, near the marathon ﬁ  n-
ish line. A week ago, it was a place of carnage. On Sunday, it 
became a sanctuary — an open-air church, synagogue, mosque and temple, rolled all into one.”
What we can do now, in order to not focus on the tragedy, 
is to focus on healing the communities affected by the sheer in-sanity of last week. And please don’t jump on us for using the word “insanity” as if we’re using the word too loosely or start berating us about the mental health care opportunities in this country. We understand there’s such a thing as clinically insane 
people, but if you were on Twitter at any point last week, you’d 
understand what we mean by “insanity.”
Although the remaining suspect can’t articulate anything 
from his hospital bed, he might be formally charged, as of press time.
“Authorities have not said publicly what charges will be ﬁ  led 
against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, but a Justice Department ofﬁ  cial, who has been briefed on the case, told CNN he will face federal terrorism charges and possibly state murder charges.”
Let the authorities handle what happens to that boy. Let us 
focus on helping the healing process. Take time at 2:50 p.m. to have a brief moment of silence. Remember those who lost their lives — those at the marathon as well as Massachusetts Institute of Technology ofﬁ  cer Sean Collier, who was shot by the bomb-ing suspects on Thursday night. Bells will ring around Boston at that time.
This weekend was the London Marathon. At the start of the 
race, “thousands of runners and their supporters observed a 
30-second silence in a show of respect,” according to an article 
by USA Today.
“Damian Crosby, a banker from London who was running 
Sunday,” the article continued, “said his family would be out supporting him ‘so obviously their security is in the back of my mind. But you just need to get on with it. That’s the British way.’”
We’re here to support. We’re here to remember. We’re not 
here to dwell or give any publicity to the suspects, regardless of 
how many of them are alive or able to speak in general.
Let’s thank the ﬁ  rst responders and the teams of people who 
combed through images and videos of the event to narrow in on 
our answers. Let’s take a deep breath and move forward. It’s a new week.Reﬂ  ecting on my college experience
This is the end, my only friends, the end.
We’ve done it: another school year come and gone 
like a hobo running away after he’s ﬁ  nished mastur-
bating in the parking lot behind Leonardo’s.
For me, it’s the last one. This time two weeks from now, 
I’ll be a college graduate. I’ve gotten a lot of help from a lot of people on the way to this point, so I want to use this space to thank them.
First, I’d like to thank Sami Main, the Alligator’s opinions 
editor, for supporting me even when various Internet com-menters called in no uncertain terms for my rape, murder and ﬁ  ring. (Not in that order.) During the Neal Boortz ﬁ  asco earlier this semester, she wrote a kick-a-- editorial backing me up. (By the way, the headline for that editorial was one 
of the best burns I’ve ever seen in print.)
It probably would’ve been easy for her to disown me, 
print a retraction and go on like nothing happened. Instead, 
she laughed with me at the haters and sent them a love let-ter with more snark than a Lewis Carroll poem. Everyone needs to remember the name Sami Main because 10 years from now she’s gonna be working with Tina Fey while we’re all ﬂ  ipping burgers and stealing change from home-less people.
That reminds me: I need to thank everyone who’s ever 
helped me out ﬁ  nancially. I’m worse with money than An-toine Walker, which explains why I’m eternally broke. So many people have been there for me at one time or another, in ways both big and small, it amazes me.
Maybe it was just buying me a burger or paying me $50 to 
lay mulch for a day or letting me borrow rent money while I was waiting on a paycheck. I don’t have enough space here to list everyone or to fully express how much it’s meant to 
me to be the recipient of this wonderful outpouring, but just 
know: If you’ve ever given me money or food or helped me in any other way, I won’t forget. Maybe someday I’ll be not broke, and then, boy, things are gonna turn around for you and ol’ Dallin.
Until then, you kinda have to settle for old-fashioned, 
heartfelt gratitude.
Lastly, I’d like to thank every professor who’s dealt with the headache that is having me in a class.
I’ll be the ﬁ  rst to admit it: 
I’m a self-important a--hole with an overinﬂ  ated opinion 
of my own abilities. I like to 
write really ambitious papers, and I don’t always succeed, so what I turn in is often a terrible version of an essay that ends 
with me basically saying, “I tried, and I failed. Oops.”
I can’t imagine having to grade my s---. So thanks for put-
ting up with me, teach! Beyond that, I’ve learned an aston-ishing amount about literature, philosophy and life from all 
of you.
If I have one piece of advice for young underclassmen or 
incoming collegians, it’s this: Listen to your profs. They’ve 
been around the allegorical block, they’ve written a lot and read a lot more, and they’ve got some ideas that’ll change the way you see everything. I’ll never forget the day Dr. Shoaf told me, “Singularity is analogous to insanity,” or when Dr. Dunkle (my mentor at community college) said, “You know, a man can buy a degree, but he can’t buy an 
education.”
That’s the truest thing I’ve learned in college. There’s a 
way to get through without learning anything: Trust me, 
I’ve seen it done and did it for a while. It wasn’t until I start-ed reading the material, listening in class and really thinking about what I was learning that college started to make sense to me.
College is the time to ﬁ  nd as many ideas as you can, get 
as much information about them as possible and then pick 
the ones you like best. Don’t be scared of thinking! It’s never 
bad to have an open mind.
Anyway, this is supposed to be an opinion column — 
even though most of the time I kinda just ramble incoher-ently about nothing because I’m an incorrigible jacka--. So, here’s my opinion for today and for forever: F--- off, haters.

The current Supreme Court debate over 
the constitutionality of California’s Proposition 8 has captivated the hearts 
and minds of the American people, and stri-dent voices on both sides of the issue have been making themselves known more boldly than ever before. So often I find that, as a 
Christian, I am expected to be a steadfast op-
ponent of marriage equality, and it’s because of this that people are often surprised to learn nothing could be further from the truth.
In my four years as a religion major, I’ve 
studied the Bible extensively and discovered it doesn’t say much about same-sex relation-ships. In fact, it’s possible to count the num-ber of references to homosexuality on two 
hands, an indication it wasn’t that important 
of a topic for the authors of the Bible.
In the Old Testament, injunctions against 
homosexual practice occur alongside laws that prohibit eating shellfish (Leviticus 11:9-
12) and wearing clothing woven from two 
different fabrics (Leviticus 19:19). This makes sense when one views the Levitical law as Is-rael’s means of distinguishing itself from its 
pagan neighbors. For the priestly authors of 
Leviticus, then, breaking one of these statutes was not committing an ethical wrong but a ritual one. In the New Testament, references to homosexuality are conspicuously absent 
in the teachings of Jesus and primarily re-
ferred to male prostitution and pederasty in the letters of Paul.
These practices were common in the Greek 
world at the time and are a far cry from the kind of monogamous relationships we think of today when we talk about same-sex rela-tionships.
Going beyond the realm of Biblical stud-
ies, anyone who has studied Christian his-tory knows gays are just another group in a long line of “others” (Jews, “heretics,” wom-en, African-Americans, etc.) Christians have 
persecuted over the years by misusing and 
misinterpreting the Bible.
But a bunch of scholarly literature about 
the Bible and homosexuality wasn’t what made me a supporter of LGBT rights. It was 
one of the most fundamental aspects of my 
faith — loving relationships. It was only when I heard some of the 
heartbreaking stories told by gay men and women that I really came to understand how 
serious an issue this was.
After all, it’s difficult to really see things 
from someone else’s point of view when you 
build up barriers by living in a world domi-
nated by theory and rhetoric, a world devoid 
of any notion of dialogue and true under-standing.
How can you judge something you don’t 
really understand? Particularly touching was 
the story of a gay Christian who had contem-
plated suicide because he thought God had made a mistake when he made him.
One need not be a Christian to realize just 
how toxic a theology this is.
Put frankly, I believe in a God of love, one 
who accepts us and loves us for who we are. 
When I hear stories like this, I wonder 
if the Christians 
who convinced this young man he was an abomination 
ever stopped to think if what they were do-ing felt like love, whether it felt like Jesus. I find it extremely unlikely anyone would con-sciously choose a life of persecution, so we are left to contend with the cold, hard fact 
that being gay is not a choice — and if it’s not 
a choice, how can God punish someone for being who they really are?
As Christians, we should be fighting for 
justice and for the dignity of all people — gay or straight, black or white, Hindu or Muslim.
Just like we are all equal in the eyes of 
God, we should all be equal in the eyes of 
the law.
All Christians are supposed to strive to 
live like Jesus, right? So, like Jesus, let’s stand 
with the marginalized and oppressed. Like 
Jesus, let’s be advocates for love and human 
dignity.
My prayer, then, is this: “[L]et justice roll 
down like waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream,” (Amos 5:24).

Speaking OutI was raised on the notion that 
with hard work, qualifications and passion, no job or goal is 
out of reach. 
When I came to UF, I learned 
that in Student Government, this is 
not the case. Certain positions are 
doled out based on organizational 
affiliation above all else, shutting out other potentially qualified stu-
dents while making members of the 
“right” groups seem qualified on 
paper.
On Tuesday, the Student Senate 
heard Swamp Party president-elect 
Christina Bonarrigo’s nominations 
for the executive branch. Many of 
these applicants were qualified and quickly confirmed. However, two nominations stood out as crony ap-
pointments based on organizational 
membership, a practice commonly known as “legacy positions.”
The positions in question? The 
paid top spots of Accent Speakers Bureau and Student Government Productions, which have a com-bined budget of almost  $1.5 million 
in student money.
It is well-documented that lead-
ership in Accent and SGP is almost 
always given to members of Alpha Epsilon Pi and Theta Chi fraterni-ties.
Twenty of the last 23 Accent 
chairmen have been brothers in AEPi, and eight of the last 10 chair-men of SGP were members of Theta 
Chi. The Swamp Party’s nominees 
this year were no different.
This situation presents two prob-
lems.
First, it is fundamentally unfair 
for any student to receive preferen-tial treatment because of his or her  organizational affiliation. 
We all gained admission to UF based on our qualifications, and SG positions should be evaluated no differently. 
All students deserve a fair shot 
to earn any position offered at this university.
Another problem with legacy 
positions is they prevent the most qualified students from serving our campus. When the potential pool of applicants is limited to two fra-ternities, many qualified students 
(especially women) are left out of 
consideration.
The Student Body is best served 
by a large applicant pool with many 
qualified individuals rather than a 
coronation of the next person in 
line.
N o t 
only are 
these posi-
tions paid, but they 
also hold significant power. In Jus-
tin Hayes’ column from April 17, 
we heard how Accent withholds the best seats in the house from ev-eryday students, saving them for Accent members and other “im-
portant” students (many affiliated 
in some way with the SG majority party).
It’s easy to see how cronyism in 
selecting these leaders can become cronyism during their time in of-fice.
The Student Body should de-
mand better from both the actions 
of these student leaders and the 
process by which they are selected. I hope you join me in demanding an end to the use of legacy positions 
and call on SG to fill positions based 
on merit instead.

� UF ONLY ADMITS TRANSFER AND 
INNOVATION ACADEMY STUDENTS FOR 
SPRING.
KELSEY WONDERLIN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Although other schools are increasing fresh-
men Spring admissions, UF is not.
During the last few years, more and more 
colleges, like the University of Southern Califor-
nia,  have been sending acceptance letters for the Spring semester to students who applied for the Fall semester, according to an article in The New York Times.
However, UF undergraduate Spring admis-
sions are exclusively for transfer students, said UF spokesman Steve Orlando. UF has seen a small increase in Spring transfer students, accept-ing about 50 more students each year for the past three years.
The exception to limiting Spring admission 
is the option for freshmen to apply for UF’s In-novation Academy, which offers an alternate un-dergraduate experience with a Spring-Summer schedule and an emphasis on innovation, creativ-ity, entrepreneurship and ethics, Orlando said.
Italo Lenta, operations coordinator for the In-
novation Academy, said it allows more students to become Florida Gators. According to the UF Office of Institutional Planning and Research, about 30,000 prospective students apply each year for one of about 6,500 available spots in UF’s Fall class.“Every year, UF has to turn away thousands 
of talented students,” Lenta said. “The Innova-tion Academy allows the university to take more 
cream off the top of the crop.”
Orlando said with more students taking 
classes in the Summer semesters, the academy 
also makes use of facilities that were previously underused.
Brittany Van Voorhees, a 20-year-old UF tele-
communication sophomore, said a program like the Innovation Academy would probably have been helpful to her in adjusting to UF as a fresh-man. She said she had such a negative experi-ence she almost transferred to another school. Pressured by her parents to head straight to Gainesville and start at Santa Fe College in the Fall of 2011, she said never got to experience liv-ing on campus and struggled to meet people.
Unlike Voorhees’ experience, the new under-
graduate program is apparently well-accepted by students. Orlando said the academy received be-tween 2,500 and 3,000 applications for next year’s class, up from about 1,500 applications received for this year’s inaugural class.
Although students in the academy won’t be 
enrolled in classes for the football-filled Fall se-mester, Lenta said they can use this time to study abroad, do service projects, or get internships or jobs. He said many students choose to work or intern in Gainesville during the Fall so they can still go to football games and familiarize them-selves with the campus and resources.
“They have the free time to become a part of 
the community here and learn what they’re inter-ested in before they start classes,” Lenta said.UF not springing on admissionsBUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

Florida fell behind for the third 
straight game against Missouri. 
Unlike the previous two contests, Sunday’s series finale ended in UF’s first loss in two weeks. 
The Tigers (12-23, 5-13 South-
eastern Conference) plated two runs off right-hander Tucker Simpson in the first inning on Sunday afternoon at Taylor Sta-dium in Columbia, Mo., to snap the Gators’ (22-19, 10-8 SEC) eight-game winning streak.
Simpson allowed two runs in 
2.2 innings during UF’s 8-2 loss. The Florida offense wasted a chance to score in the fourth in-ning with runners on second and third with no outs. A strikeout, fly out and groundout ended the promising start to the fourth and 
changed the game.
“I thought that was the ball 
game to be quite honest with 
you,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “It was a shame. We needed to put the ball in play.”
Freshman left-hander Parker 
Danciu replaced Simpson with the bases loaded and two outs in the bottom of the third. He induced an inning-ending ground ball to second baseman Casey Turgeon from catcher Dylan Kelly.
Before the ninth, Taylor Gush-
ue’s solo home run off left-hand-er Jake Walsh marked Florida’s only run. Brady Roberson scored on a groundball from Turgeon in the ninth for UF’s second run on Sunday. Walsh allowed just three base runners in 3.2 innings of re-
lief for the victory.
Right-hander John Miles 
earned his second save with a 
seven-out appearance.
Missouri scored two runs in 
each of its final three innings. It wasn’t a sharp performance from Florida without the solid de-fense and effective bullpen that 
became a fixture during its win-
ning streak. Seven base runners reached on two-strike counts with three of those two-strike hits resulting in runs. A fielding error and a hesitant throw on a double play opportunity by third base-man Zack Powers led to two runs in the sixth. 
Despite the lackluster finale, 
there was plenty to be happy about. Florida has won three of its last four conference series. 
“We had a heck of a ball game 
[on Saturday] and came out here with a win in a 15-inning ball game with a lot of guys contribut-ing,” O’Sullivan said. “We came 
from behind on Friday against a 
really good Friday night pitch-er. All in all it was a successful weekend.”
Magliozzi closes in on school re-
cord: It took longer than usual on Saturday for Johnny Magliozzi to pick up his 11th save of the season. He not only tossed his first pitch in the 15th , but he also walked a batter, allowed a hit and threw a wild pitch. He stranded the tying and game-winning runs.
Florida hosts South Florida 
(26-14) Tuesday night at 7. Ma-gliozzi sits two saves shy of the single season school record set by Danny Wheeler in 1994 and Josh Fogg in 1998.
“It’s not always going to be 
1-2-3. I wouldn’t trade Mags for anybody in the country,” O’Sullivan said Saturday night. “I think that’s his 11th save on the year. He wants the ball. With the game on the line like that, I wouldn’t want anybody else hav-ing the ball for us.”

After three mediocre starts against Missis-
sippi State and Kentucky, Hannah Rogers had 
something to prove.
The junior right-hander had surrendered 
11 earned runs in her three previous games, 
including a five-run inning against the Bull-
dogs on April 7. But Rogers put any doubts to rest in No. 3 Florida’s 8-0 run-rule victory against Longwood on Sunday at Katie Seash-ole Pressly Stadium.
Rogers completed the No. 3 Gators’ (45-5, 
14-4 Southeastern Conference) sweep of the Lancers (33-14, 13-5 Big South Conference) with six hitless innings.
“It was exciting,” Rogers said. “I just felt 
like all my pitches were working. … The past couple weeks, I’ve just been struggling a bit with some of my pitches.”
Rogers had one of her best outings of the 
season on Sunday, striking out eight in six in-nings without walking a batter.
The lone blemish on Rogers’ line came 
in the third inning when Longwood center fielder Katie Shinrock reached base on an er-ror by shortstop Katie Medina. The error was the only thing separating Rogers from her first 
career perfect game.
“I think she was a quick runner,” Rogers 
said. “I went up to Katie and told her, ‘Thank 
you for taking the error for me.’ If she would have got the ball, she might have had a chance to beat it out, and then they could have got a hit.”
Rogers otherwise silenced a lineup that had 
three batters hitting over .400 coming into the 
weekend, including catcher Megan Baltzell, 
who leads the NCAA with 23 home runs.
“Longwood’s got a good swinging team,” coach Tim Walton said. “They can hit the ball.”
The top three hitters in the Lancers’ lineup 
— Kori Nishitomi, Baltzell and Brooke Short — went 5 for 27 over the weekend. Against 
Rogers, the trio went 2 for 16.
Roger’s no-hitter came 
just a day after she domi-
nated the Lancers in a com-
plete-game victory in the series opener. On Saturday, 
Rogers allowed a run while striking out 11 in the Gators’ 5-1 win. 
Rogers commanded her pitches well 
against Longwood, striking out 19 batters in her two games without issuing a free pass.
The no-hitter was Roger’s second of the 
year. The first came in Florida’s 9-1 win against Mississippi State on April 5. Rogers’ first no-hitter was also a six-inning game. She also contributed to UF’s combined perfect game against Presbyterian on March 3.
The last time a Florida pitcher threw two 
solo no-hitters was Stacey Nelson, who held against Arkansas and Ole Miss hitless in 2009.
But while the Lancers struggled to get the 
bat on the ball, the Gators’ bats came alive, scoring 22 runs in the series.
Third baseman Stephanie Tofft led the of-
fensive barrage, going 8 for 10 at the plate with three home runs, two doubles and a triple. The junior drove in nine runs during the weekend, raising her batting average from .282 to .319, the second-highest on the team.
“It’s been a while since I’ve felt like this,” 
Tofft said. 
Added Walton: “I haven’t seen a hitter 
have a week like that.”

Florida celebrates its victory at the NCAA Championships on Saturday in Los Angeles. Florida 
posted a team score of 197.575, which edged second-place Oklahoma’s tally of 197.375. The victory gave the Gators their first national championship.
Sloan: ‘It feels pretty dang good’
In Florida’s next event, John-
son, King and Hunter tallied three 
scores of 9.9 on the vault. Sloan, the Southeastern Conference Freshman of the Year then added 
a score of 9.95, giving Florida a 
148.1 after three events. 
After losing their lead to the 
Crimson Tide on the final rotation at the 2012 NCAA Champion-ships, the Gators needed a strong finish this season. Uneven bars was a welcome sight for UF.
As the nation’s top-ranked 
team on uneven bars prior to the NCAA Championships, Florida made its final push in its best event. 
After Bianca Dancose-Giam-
battisto and King led off the rota-tion with scores of 9.85 and 9.875, 
respectively, the rest of the rota-
tion picked up the slack. Sloan, Johnson and Mackenzie Caquatto posted scores of 9.9 or higher to secure the Gators’ first title. 
“My voice is basically gone. 
That’s what we wanted to do — leave here with no voice,” Sloan said. “We left everything out on 
the floor. This event does not com-
pare to worlds or the Olympics, but it feels pretty dang good.”
After winning the top prize on 
Saturday, Florida swept the indi-vidual event finals.
Alaina Johnson won the un-
even bars title, and Sloan claimed 
the beam and vault champion-
ships.
Despite missing time due to a 
stress fracture this season, John-son scored a 9.95 on uneven bars. Sloan and Mackenzie Caquatto came in a tie for third with a score of 9.9.
Sloan scored the only 9.95 on 
balance beam to take the outright victory.

GolfNo. 4 Florida (16-1, 4-1 American La-
crosse Conference) dominated defend-ing national champion Northwestern (13-2, 4-1 ALC) in a 22-4 win at home 
on Saturday. The Gators defense held the Wildcats to a .222 shot percentage — their lowest mark this season. The loss was the most lopsided defeat the Northwestern lacrosse team has ever suffered.
No. 3 Florida upset top-ranked Geor-gia 4-0 on Sunday to grab its fourth consecutive Southeastern Conference 
title. Florida earned 4-1 victories against Vanderbilt in the quarterfinals and Texas A&M in the semifinals. The Gators struggled in doubles play during the weekend, dropping the doubles point in their matches against the Commodores and the Aggies. But UF changed its luck in doubles against UGA. Freshmen Danielle Collins and Brianna Morgan grabbed an 8-3 win on their court. Lauren Embree and Sofie Oyen defeated top-ranked doubles pairing Kate Fuller and Silvia Garcia for a 9-8 victory. Florida’s 2013 SEC title is its 19th conference championship. After sweeping No. 6 seed South Caro-
lina on Friday, third-seeded Florida saw its four-match winning streak end in a 4-2 loss to No. 2 seed Tennessee in the Southeastern Conference Tournament semifinals on Saturday in Oxford, Miss. The Gators fell behind 1-0 as the Volunteers took the doubles point. UT’s Mikelis Libietis, the No. 3 player in the country, was too much for UF to handle Saturday. He defeated junior Stephane Piro 6-2, 6-4 on Court 1. Along with Hunter Reese, Libietis knocked off Piro and senior Bob van Overbeek 8-4 in doubles play. 
Florida won eight events and set eight personal-
best marks on Saturday during their final home meet — the Tom Jones Memorial Classic. Junior Stephanie Strasser set a personal best while winning the women’s 1500m — an event the Gators swept, finishing in all three top spots. Florida also swept the men’s 3000m and hammer throw, winning the top four spots in each. This weekend’s Arkansas Spring Invitational is the last regular season meet for Florida before the SEC Championships. 
Both teams had a disappointing finish at the SEC 
Championships as the men’s team finished in 10th place and the women’s team finished in 13th.  The men’s team finished 32 strokes (+40) behind cham-
pion Alabama (+8). Senior captain Tyler McCumber was the lone bright spot during the weekend. McCumber finished tied for third after shoot-ing one under par for the tournament. The women’s squad struggled as well, losing to champion Alabama by 53 strokes (+88). The best finisher for the Gators was sophomore Camilla Hedberg, who finished tied for 23rd (+16). Both teams will compete in the NCAA Regionals, which begin on May 16 for the men and May 9 for the women.   

To teammate Lauren Embree, 
Alexandra Cercone is a “fighter.”
However, Cercone considers 
herself just another player on the 
team.
The 21-year-old may be just 
competitive in her own terms, but the junior tennis player has proven herself in a new way for the Gators.
“Mentally, she’s at a completely 
different level now then she was in the fall,” coach Roland Thornqvist said. “The higher the stakes, the bet-ter she is.”
Cercone dropped five singles 
matches during the fall season and only won six. Once 2013 began, Cer-cone found her niche controlling the court, earning an 18-2 singles record. 
“I kind of have this problem 
with expectations,” Cercone said of her slump in the fall. 
“I put a lot of pressure on myself, 
and I always wanted to do well in-dividually because that’s your sort of moment of an accomplishment that is solely your own. Focusing on that didn’t work in my favor.”
However, Cercone’s success at 
Florida almost never happened.
Cercone dreamed of playing ten-
nis on the West Coast because of the high level of competition that it of-fered and the appeal of being away from home. She loved the West Coast atmosphere after playing in numerous juniors tournaments there.
“I had these farfetched, roman-
tic ideas of going far away to Cali-fornia,” Cercone said. “I would get emails from [Thornqvist] and [as-sociate head coach Dave Balogh] and would respond to them, but I remember deep down feeling guilty about it because I was like, ‘Oh, I’m leading them on. They probably think I’m interested in their school, but I’m just trying to be polite by re-sponding.’”Cercone even doubted further-
ing her tennis career at all.
“There was an awkward space 
in time when I was a senior in high school, where I was too old to play the international junior tournaments but I knew I still had to compete,” Cercone said. 
The Seminole native competed in 
USC pro-circuit tournaments across the country and grew tired of it.
“I didn’t know a lot of people, 
so I was kind of on my own a lot, which is difficult because you have to find people to practice with,” Cercone said. “It was hard to have good results because there are older women competing there with tons of experience. I started to not really like that kind of lifestyle.”
With the snapped allure of trav-
eling week after week to compete, Cercone came around to the orange and blue.
“I was flying home from a USC 
pro-circuit event when I was kind of looking out the window to the Tampa Bay area and I was just like ‘I need to go to Florida,’” Cercone said. “It just hit me.” 
Cercone said that longtime friend 
Embree also factored in to her deci-sion on Florida. The two friends met around the age of 13, playing with and against each other in in-state ju-niors tournaments. 
“There was a time where the 
only time I would be ranked No. 1 in the state was when Lauren aged out of the division,” Cercone said. “So when she would be one, I would be two. And then when she moved up, I was like, ‘Yes I get to be one again.’”
Once Embree grabbed a spot on 
the Gators’ roster, Cercone said she would convince her to come to Flor-ida, ending phone conversations with “Go Gators.”
After making her decision to 
play for Florida, elite level tennis came quickly for Cercone, having to compete for a national title during her first year with the Gators.
Cercone slumped in the first set 
of the 2011 NCAA Women’s Tennis Championships final, losing 6-4 to Stanford’s Veroncia Li. In the sec-ond, Cercone dominated en route to a 6-1 win,  forcing the third. Car-rying her momentum into the third, Cercone broke the 3-3 tie. She put up a 5-3 lead and grabbed the over-all win at 6-4.  
“I remember people trash talking 
me in the stands, saying I was going to choke. And I was like ‘How dare they say that I’m going to choke.’ I was so mad,” Cercone said of her 
first NCAA Championship experi-
ence. “I just remember walking up and hitting an ace and just being like ‘Yeah, take that.’”
Her singles win in the finals was 
her fifth consecutive in the NCAA 
Tournament, and she was the only 
Gator in school history to reach this 
win streak in the national competi-tion. As a freshman, Cercone was 
competing at a level she never knew she could reach when she first came to Florida.
“I was a little bit intimidated at 
first because when I initially came in I thought I was going to be this 
really important impact player for 
the team,” she said. “And then I was like ‘Oh, well everyone else is just as good, if not better.’”
After helping the Gators win 
a national title, Cercone said she 
couldn’t imagine playing anywhere 
else.
“Winning that solidified the fact 
that I had made the right decision in coming to Florida,” Cercone said. 
“Everybody wants to compete for a national-championship team, so the fact that we did win and were able to pull it out made me feel con-fident in all of my life decisions at that point.”
Embree added: “Never when we 
were 14 or 15 did we think we’d be at the same college and competing together for titles.” 
A second national title came 
for the Gators in the 2012 NCAA Tournament, but without Cercone, Florida would have been sent home in the semifinals 
Facing third-seeded Duke’s 
Mary Clayton, Cercone rallied from a 2-0 third set deficit to earn a three-set singles victory and clinch the match.
“She was just a surgeon at the 
end,” Thornqvist said. “She put the ball where she wanted it to be.”
Florida advanced to meet for-
merly top-ranked UCLA in the fi-nals, and Cercone helped the Gators edge the Bruins.
In doubles, Cercone paired with 
Carolina Hitimana and used an ace to clinch the doubles point in the 8-5 match win.
Building on the doubles mo-
mentum, Cercone played fast and was the first Gator off the court. She swept up Chanelle Van Nguyen 6-2 in the first set and shut her out 6-0 in the second to extend a 2-0 lead over UCLA. 
Now a veteran player for the 
Gators with back-to-back national titles and a 90-26 career singles re-cord under her belt, Cercone’s colle-giate tennis career speaks for itself.
“When we play big matches, 
Alex is someone we can count on every time, and that’s a very unique quality,” Thornqvist said. “Some-times you know what you’re going to get when we recruit great players from the juniors, but with Alex, she continues to surprise us and contin-ues to improve.”
For now, Cercone values tennis 
and wants nothing more than an-other winning year for herself and the Gators. 
“I’m focusing on the game now, 
rather than winning or losing, and it’s definitely working out,” Cer-cone said. “I’m doing a lot better.”MONDAY, APRIL 22, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15
