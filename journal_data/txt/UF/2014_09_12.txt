The Gator Nation has been smiling all week  
following Florida’s 65-0 extravaganza against 
Eastern Michigan Saturday. But as any offen-sive line coach  would say: the offense is only as good as the execution along the front five.
That notion holds true in the Southeastern 
Conference, which is truly a line-of-scrimmage league week-in and week-out. 
This week, the battle in the trenches between 
Florida’s offensive front and Kentucky’s defen-sive line will be a key matchup to watch. 
You want to score points? You better have an 
offensive line that can execute.
■   ■   ■
Florida’s line took a hit in Saturday as junior 
left tackle D.J. Humphries went down with a bone chip in his ankle. Humphries is expected to be back in Week 6 of the season, when the Gators take on Tennessee in Knoxville. 
Filling in for Humphries at left tackle is Chaz 
Green, who was Florida’s starting right tackle to begin the season.
Redshirt freshman Rod Johnson, who saw a 
lot of playing time in the opener after Humphries went down in the second quarter, will man the right tackle spot. 
Green said this week the switch isn’t as diffi-
cult as it may sound, and the biggest adjustment is in technique.
“You’re used to having your left leg be your 
parallel leg,” Green said. “On the left side (of the offensive line), it’s your right leg. It’s just body positioning and being more used to changing 
up your technique and everything.”
Johnson, sporting a menacing 6-foot-6, 310-
pound frame, came in from the 2013 recruiting 
class as the No. 30 ranked offensive tackle in the 
country. He has slimmed down from his high school days as well. 
Running back Kelvin Taylor, who had 68 
yards and two touchdowns on Saturday, feels confident in the youngster’s ability to step up.
“Rod, he’s going to do a tremendous job. 
He’s going to do a great job,” the sophomore said. “So I feel like we’re not going to lose too much. But I mean, D.J., we’re probably going to lose a little, but Rod’s filling in pretty good.”
■   ■   ■
Kentucky’s defensive front is led by return-
ing starters Za’Darius Smith and Alvin “Bud” Dupree, who both received All-SEC honors fol-lowing the end of last season. 
Smith and Dupree have combined for 15 to-
tal tackles in their first two games, while Dupree currently has 16 sacks in his career and needs just one more sack to tie for fourth most all-time in Kentucky’s program history. 
“94 (Smith) is a physical long, can rush the 
passer. 2’s (Dupree) the same way, he’s very versatile for ‘em but he’s got a lot of length and a lot of power,” UF offensive coordinator Kurt Roper said. “He can obviously, you know, get 
up field on pass rushing situations and do a 
good job.”
Green, who has 21 starts under his belt 
throughout his career at Florida, has been mentoring the young Johnson throughout the game week, preparing him for his first start as a Gator.
“Me and him are real close,” Green said. 
“I’ve tried to help him out with various things: 
what to expect going into a game, helping him 
out with the offense and his technique. He’s done a great job at this point.”
Florida’s offensive line didn’t allow a single 
sack against Eastern Michigan, but with youth and inexperience rotating around the offensive 
line, that might change Saturday.
With Johnson and true freshman David 
Sharpe playing a majority of Florida’s season 
opener, the Gators have confidence the young linemen will be up to the test.
“I think they did good after they got their jit-
ters out,” said senior Trenton Brown, who start-ed at right guard on Saturday. “I think they did good. I will say they did better than me in my first game in the Swamp. But I think they did a great job last week for their first game.”
■   ■   ■
On the flip side, Kentucky’s offensive line 
has done a poor job of holding off the pass rush, giving up five sacks in their first two games against Tennessee-Martin and Ohio.  
Kentucky will not get a break this week as 
it is going up against one of the country’s most 
lethal pass rushes led by defensive ends Dante Fowler Jr. and Jonathan Bullard. 
Linebacker Neiron Ball had an impressive 
outing last Saturday, tying with Mike Taylor for 
a team-high six total tackles — 2.5 of those being 
tackles for loss. 
As a whole, UF had three sacks for 18 yards 
against Eastern Michigan while forcing 11 quar-
terback hurries and nine total tackles for loss.
“Obviously a sack is great, that’s the icing 
on the cake,” said D.J. Durkin, UF defensive coordinator. “When you get a sack or a tackle for loss, that sets offenses off track, gets them in long-yardage situations. … But to me that’s a byproduct of how we’re affecting the quarter-back and I think you can do that in many differ-ent ways.”
■   ■   ■
Florida-Kentucky has not been much of a se-
ries in a very long time. The Gators lost to the Wildcats since 1986 — before most of UF’s cur-rent students were born.
Despite the win streak and despite Florida’s 
dominance in the series as of late, Muschamp isn’t looking too deeply into it.
Instead of worrying about Florida continuing 
its win streak against Kentucky, the fourth-year head coach is looking to end one of the Gators’ streaks — its five-game losing skid in the SEC.
“That would be a good one, there’s no doubt 
about that,” Muschamp said, “but this is the 2014 Florida team vs. the 2014 Kentucky team. I don’t 
know that any of those games in the history will 
(matter) on Saturday night. But there’s no doubt that we need to end that  (losing) streak.’’
If the Gators want to make it to Atlanta for 
the SEC Championship game in December, they have to take the first step. 
That step is simple: beat Kentucky.KICKOFF

� POLICE REINTERVIEWED VICTIMS.
KRISTAN WIGGINS
Alligator Staff Writer kwiggins@alligator.org
Gainesville Police and University Police 
announced Thursday that one of the four 
attacks reported both on and near UF’s campus since Aug. 30 was unfounded and not related to the rest.
The unrelated assault was reported last 
Friday. The victim said she was attacked while leaving Library West around 3 a.m. with a friend. But after a series of re-inter-views, GPD concluded the incident did not ﬁ  t the pattern of the other three attacks, ac-cording to a GPD press release.
Though the victim originally said she 
was attacked on campus, she said Tuesday she was groped by an unknown man off 
campus, according to a UPD press release.The victim admitted to being intoxicated 
when she made the ﬁ  rst report, but police 
said she gave honest answers throughout the investigation. Ofﬁ  cers do not think she 
purposely fabricated any part of the report, 
so she will not be facing any charges.
“We believe there is still a suspect out 
there that has committed very personal and invasive crimes in our city,” GPD spokes-man Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias said in the release. “We are conﬁ  dent that the three other vic-tims were attacked as they reported, and we will not stop until we have expended every 
effort to identify the suspect and bring him 
to justice.”

Gator fans tailgating on Plaza of the 
Americas on Saturday will be joined by 
former Gator football quarterback Tim 
Tebow.  
Tebow will come to UF on Saturday 
as part of the SEC Nation show.
The show will broad-
cast from campus before 
the Kentucky game. The 
Florida vs. Kentucky game will start at 7:30 p.m. and will air on the SEC Network.
Tents and a stage for 
the show are already set 
up on the plaza. The show will air from 10 a.m. to noon.  Fans can arrive around 9 a.m. to be part of the show.  
Sarah Stalter, an 18-year-old UF crim-
inology freshman, said she plans on go-ing  to see Tebow.
She said the one thing she loves about 
football is the spirit.
“I love the atmosphere and how ev-
eryone is so behind the team,” she said
Along with the former Gator quarter-
back, the SEC show will also feature host 
Joe Tessitore and former LSU and NFL 
star Marcus Spears. 
“I do think it’s pretty cool that Tim 
Tebow keeps coming back to UF,” Brian 
Ritchie, a 21-year-old UF forest manage-
ment senior, said.

Samantha Mossman has carried around 
pepper spray for years.
With two classes a week ending at 8:10 
p.m., the 21-year-old UF psychology senior said the recent attacks have intensiﬁ  ed her 
nerves about walking around campus at night.
“Luckily, because my class starts at 5:10, 
I can park on campus instead of having to take the bus,” Mossman said. “My bus stop is nowhere near the psychology building, so it would be a really far walk in the dark.”
UF and University Police have taken ex-
tra measures to keep students safe after their 
evening classes let out.  
Associate Vice President and Dean of Stu-
dents Jen Day Shaw said the UF Registrar has 
been helpful in creating maps of campus.“We’ve run maps of campus of where are 
classes, when do they let out, how many peo-ple are in them,” she said. “Both the Univer-
sity Police and SNAP and the walking escort 
service are using those maps to try to station UF students, faculty take safety measures for late night classes

Fort Myers police will soon 
start wearing body cameras.
The city council is expected to 
approve funding for the pager-
sized cameras Monday. Police expect to receive 40 cameras this month.
They chose small cameras that 
clip to shirts, which Chief Doug Baker said work better in Flori-da’s humidity and rain than the cameras that attach to glasses.Baker said the camera is a de-
vice that will keep officers and the public safe.
Miami Beach city commission-
ers voted this week to buy body cameras for police and other city officials.The News-Press reported that 
Cape Coral Police have also been testing and evaluating body cam-
eras.
According to a poll released 
Wednesday, more than two-thirds 
of Florida voters support the idea of placing body cameras on police officers to record their interaction with the public.
The issue has been increasingly 
debated since the shooting of an unarmed black 18-year-old last month in Ferguson, Missouri.

� HALF OF RAS DON’T 
LIVE IN SINGLES.
ALYSSA FISHER
Alligator Staff Writer
afisher@alligator.org
Resident assistants looking 
to live the single life started 
Fall with some unexpected company. 
About 100, or one half of the 
RAs live in spaces that could potentially accommodate a roommate, Sharon Blansett, assistant to the Associate Vice President for Student Affairs, 
wrote in an email.
Students living in two RA 
rooms were moved to perma-
nent housing Wednesday, and 16 more will be moving out. Blansett said universities must “overbook” housing, as some students do not make their acceptance decisions until the last minute.
“Some students have as 
many as 3 – 5 active admis-sion/housing contracts pend-ing final decisions,” she said. 
UF Housing contracts can 
be canceled until residence halls open in the Fall. Based on past data, staff can factor this 
into the number of contracts 
offered and accepted to ensure the halls are full, Blansett said. 
This guarantees rental rates 
to cover operational costs like mortgages, utilities and staff salaries.
Blansett said RAs being as-
signed roommates is not new 
or unique to UF. RAs, beyond 
those who volunteered, lived with a roommate in 2009, 2012 and 2014. All available RA roommate spaces were used this Fall.
Demi Danso, 21, said she 
lived alone as an RA in Yulee during the 2013-2014 school year. 
“I know some people who 
applied to be RAs just to have their own room,” the UF health science senior said. “I would’ve been devastated. After living 
with roommates, you just want 
your own space.” 
Danso said RAs living with 
roommates have it harder than she did because they are not only trying to build relation-ships between roommates in the hall, but in their own rooms as well.   
Recognizing this, housing 
offered RAs who volunteered to live with a roommate a mon-etary incentive. Those who landed a roommate by chance received one, as well.  
“This year, administrative 
staff communicated this option earlier than usual in an effort 
to allow more time for RAs to 
make decisions,” Blansett said. “The option is available every year as an (sic) voluntary op-tion.”
A priority list has been 
made to move all students liv-ing with RAs to permanent spaces as rooms become avail-
able. Undoubling RA doubles 
is a priority on this list, Blansett said, and the process will be ongoing. 
This year, about seven RAs 
with roommates requested to stay together. 
“RAs are generally support-
ive of this initiative,” Blansett 
said. “The monetary incentives 
are well-received by RAs.”RAs starting (and 
possibly finishing) Fall with roommates

A virus is affecting thousands 
in the Midwest with severe respi-
ratory symptoms, and as flu sea-son approaches, Gainesville doc-tors are on high alert.
Dr. Nicole Iovine, UF Health 
Shands Hospital epidemiologist, said Enterovirus 68 targets people from infancy to young adulthood and cases have jumped since Au-gust.
Though Enterovirus 68 is not 
in Florida, four states have con-firmed its presence, and 12 states 
are investigating potential cases, 
including Georgia. 
“Flu season approaching defi-
nitely complicates things because, regardless, there is going to be an increase in respiratory symp-toms,” Iovine said.
There are no Enterovirus 68 
treatments or medications on the market, but Iovine said the im-
mune system is capable of fight-
ing it off.
Symptoms  
are comparable to an intense cold, and the vi-rus has left some hospitalized.
“A very small 
number of people who contract the virus actually end up in inten-sive care, so if this virus is man-aged well and caught on time, the risk of complications are actually very small,” Iovine said.
Alachua County School District health services supervisor Patricia Hughes said county schools have prepared for an outbreak.
 “Any tiny complaint a student 
has, they are being sent straight to 
a licensed nurse within the school 
where proper precautions are taken,” Hughes said.
The virus tends to occur in 
schoolchildren and those who have an existing respiratory com-plication, like asthma.
Damaris Lopez, 19-year-old 
public relations sophomore at UF, 
has had asthma all her life.
“I don’t think I’ve ever gotten 
a respiratory virus before,” Lopez 
said. “I obviously don’t want to contract it, but if I do I’ll take the necessary medication to fight it. Bring it on.”
Virus outbreak may make way to FL

Anderson’s Outdoor Adventures is now 
offering canoe and kayak rentals on the Santa 
Fe River at a discounted rate. 
The adventure company is offering canoe 
rentals at $15 and kayak rentals at $10. Life 
jackets, paddles, canoes and kayaks are pro-vided.
Guests are picked up at Santa Fe River Park 
before being shuttled to the river. 
They can either paddle 8 miles downstream 
for about three hours from the first drop-off 
point or 12 miles downstream for about four hours from a farther drop-off point before ar-riving back at their vehicles. 
Company owner Charlie Anderson said 
rentals are offered between 9 a.m. and 7 p.m., and reservations require a one-day notice. He said full-moon canoe and kayak tours are available twice a month at 8 p.m.
Laura Kaler, a 21-year-old UF sports man-
agement senior, has canoed since childhood. 
“It’s not only great to be in the sun with 
friends but also a great workout,” Kaler said. “Even though Lake Wauburg offers free canoe and kayak rentals, it’s only at a lake. Being on the river enhances your nature experience.”
The Santa Fe River Canoe Outpost also has 
rentals, under $25, according to its website.
Paul Spillers, 37, owns Anderson’s Outdoor 
Adventures with Anderson. The pair hoped to build a clientele in Gainesville by keeping prices lower than competitors’.

tomers,” he said.Discounts available on Santa Fe River canoe, kayak rentalsIovine

The takeover from Sakai to Canvas could 
take until Spring 2016.
The university is continuing its migration 
to the new course management system, Can-
vas, by integrating more online sections into 
the system this semester.
Douglas Johnson, the associate director for 
learning services at UF Information Technol-
ogy, said the change to Canvas ﬁ  rst started in Spring 2014.
“Canvas has a more intuitive interface,” he 
said. “It’s got some very well-done ease-of-use 
improvements over what we used to have in 
Sakai.”  
There are 6,000 possible courses that may 
need assistance transferring to Canvas, John-son said.
Instructors have the option of having the 
UFIT migration team move ﬁ  les to Canvas and set up their course, or they can set up their courses on their own. A third option is having UFIT transfer ﬁ  les, but having the instructors set up their courses.
“I didn’t use the migration team because I 
wanted to be able to control what resources I moved from one to the other,” said Olivia Or-donez, a graduate assistant who teaches for the University Writing Program.
Ordonez said she prefers to use Sakai be-
cause of the application, which lets her grade assignments in the web browser instead of downloading ﬁ  les and then uploading them again once they are graded.
James McLaughlin, a 23-year-old UF public 
relations senior, said he has used both systems and prefers Sakai.
“It seems better organized to me,” he said.

Police take notice of where late classes let out to keep students safe
themselves in areas where students would 
need us.”
Shaw said faculty can make their own de-
cisions about letting late classes out early.
“I’ll just say from the university perspec-
tive, we are trying to think of every possible option because student safety will always be our No. 1 priority,” she said. “Faculty has to do what they feel comfortable with.”
She said she has heard about classes dis-cussing how people are getting to class, 
where they’re heading after and how they 
should always walk in a group.
Craig Roland, an art professor, said safety 
has always been part of the conversation in his late classes, as some end at 9 p.m.
“I will always emphasize when students 
leave the room not to go in a parking garage by themselves, not to walk alone by them-selves,” Roland said.
Shaw said UF is hoping to sustain the Safe 
Walk volunteer escort program. It is set to run for the next three weeks, but then it will be looked at again logistically.  
“It goes back to the whole ‘U Matter, We 
Care’ message,” she said. “We look out for each other, we take care of each other. That’s part of being in The Gator Nation.”LATE NIGHT , from page 1� ATTENDANCE NUMBERS WERE

Past patches of farmland and down a dirt 
road lies a secluded, deep blue spring. 
Devil’s Den has attracted swimmers 
since the 1880s, said scuba instructor Prince 
Johnston. What used to be a sinkhole where 
people skinny-dipped in the middle of a cow 
pasture now attracts thousands of college students each season. 
Visitors can snorkel or dive its 72-degree 
crystal clear waters, nestled beneath a dry cave of 10,000-year-old rock formations and fossil beds.
“You will not see another site like this on 
the eastern seaboard,” Johnston said.Johnston said college students through-
out north central Florida make up about half of its visitors, and social media attention this summer increased sales.
“We’ve never had this grand scale (of 
visitors),” Johnston said.
Renee Ryden, a 21-year-old UF linguistics 
senior, went to the spring in August after seeing a picture on her friend’s Instagram. 
“It’s a different environment,” Ryden 
said.
Only about 30 people can snorkel or dive 
at once in the prehistoric spring, but Johnston said the park is developing a spot-reserving system to avoid equipment shortages.
Velvet Yates, a UF classics professor, said 
the park was overcrowded the weekend she went.
 “It’s great that it’s so popular,” Yates 
said, “but it’s just kind of nuts on the week-ends, especially in the summer.”Social media drives larger

On Thursday night, President Barack Obama gave a 
nationally televised speech about his plans to com-bat ISIS, a radical Islamic group that is conquering 
and terrorizing large swaths of Iraq and Syria. Many Re-publicans and neo-conservatives have harshly criticized the president’s foreign policy, none more strongly and angrily than former Vice President Dick Cheney. Cheney, who has 
been an ubiquitous presence on television in recent days 
and weeks, seems to expect the entire world to forget that he was the architect of the Iraq War, one of the worst foreign policy disasters in American history. He is the last person Americans should be looking to as an authoritative voice on 
international issues. A throwing-stones-from-glass-houses 
DART goes to Dick Cheney.
The Westboro Baptist Church has become notorious for 
its virulent, hateful protests against the LGBT community, Jews, Catholics, celebrities and pretty much everybody else. 
Organizers of the “God Loves Gay People” website helped take the WBC down a peg by erecting a large, colorful bill-board reading “God Loves Gays” 3 miles south of the WBC compound in Topeka, Kansas. The group used some of the 
proceeds from its online funding campaign to purchase 
and design the billboard. It has also donated $10,000 to The Trevor Project, a suicide prevention hotline for LGBT youth, and another $10,000 to the National Alliance to End Home-
lessness. A rainbow-colored LAUREL to the folks at “God 
Loves Gay People.”
The issues of sexual assault and violence against women 
have dominated the news lately, both here at UF and across 
the nation. Unfortunately, not everyone has responded to 
these recent incidents in the serious and respectful manner 
that the issue deserves. Brian Kilmeade, co-host of Fox News’ “Fox and Friends” and general airhead, was forced to apol-ogize after he made jokes on-air about the Ray Rice story. 
Kilmeade came under fire after reacting to the video footage 
of Rice’s acts of assault by saying, “The message is, take the stairs!” Kilmeade gave a miserably weak apology Tuesday. “Comments that were made during this story made some feel like we are taking the situation too lightly,” he said. 
“We are not, we were not.” Making tasteless jokes about an 
extremely sensitive and serious issue is the very definition of “taking the situation too lightly.” A have-you-no-shame? 
DART to Brian Kilmeade and “Fox and Friends.”
In the wake of the four cases of assault on or near the 
UF campus, the Gator community has come together to help create a more secure environment for all UF students and to hopefully put an end to these troubling cases of violence. Although some have criticized local law enforcement for al-
lowing these assaults to take place, the actions of University 
Police following the assaults have gone above and beyond in ensuring the safety of UF for all students. Claims that the UPD is more concerned with jaywalking than these cases of 
assault are ridiculous, unfounded and completely unhelp-
ful. This week, we’re giving a stronger-together LAUREL to 
victims of assault and their allies, particularly the UPD.Time to tear down the language barrier
One of things I have always loved about Gainesville 
and UF is the fact that I always hear snippets of different languages as I walk around campus. 
Coming from a smaller town, I remember being sur-
prised when I overheard an animated conversation being spoken in Mandarin beside me on Turlington Plaza on the second day of my freshman year. 
Arabic, Hindi, Japanese, Spanish and many other lan-
guages are all spoken on UF’s campus. This diversity of language adds a wonderful multicultural facet to life at UF.
The language someone speaks is far more than just a 
way to communicate. It is bound to a way of life, a culture, and it is often part of a rich and vibrant history.  
Many people argue that new immigrants in America 
should discard their native languages and only speak English instead. 
They believe English is the only language that truly 
matters today in our increasingly interconnected world and global economy.
This narrow, English-only mindset is arrogant and ri-
diculous. 
Although it is extremely useful to speak fluent English 
in the U.S. for economic and social purposes, English is by no means the only language that matters. Americans would do well to remember and appreciate that.  
When people learn a new language, they learn a new 
way to connect with others, and they get a small taste of another culture.
 Learning a new language helps us become members of 
global society, citizens of the world.
A recent study from Cambridge reveals that in the next 
two decades, more than 25 percent of the world’s languag-es will face extinction.
 If this frightening statistic is accurate, the human race 
will lose more than mere sequences of words and sounds; it will lose culture. Rich histories of human interaction will be swept away, and some of the world’s vibrant and di-verse ways of life will be lost.
There is no doubt that globalization, fueled by an Eng-
lish-dominated economic system, has expanded human-ity’s horizons. 
By facilitating a cross-continental exchange of resourc-
es and understanding, globalization has helped bring hu-mans closer together than ever before. 
However, we must take care not to lose important cul-
tural treasures to a whitewash of homogenous mass com-munication.
I encourage everyone who attends a college or univer-
sity to seize the opportunity to learn a new language as part of his or her educational career. 
Learning a new language is a way to expand your hori-
zons and preserve methods of communication that might otherwise be lost and forgotten.  Broadening your linguis-tic capabilities will also jumpstart your own experience in the big, exciting world that exists outside of the U.S.  
UF has a high-quality and diverse language depart-
ment. With more than 22 languages taught and researched on campus, there are opportunities to learn anything from Turkish to Swahili.
 Learning a new language will ultimately help you un-
derstand more about the world around you and all it has to offer.  It acts as a gesture of respect and humility toward other cultures, something that America has lacked at times throughout its history.
Learning another language is also a step toward ad-
mitting there is more to the world than what exists inside your own comfort zone or social bubble.
If English is the only language you know, it’s time to 
break out of that bubble. 
As wonderful and beautiful as the English language is, 
it is simply not the only one worth learning.

Literally everything changed 
after President Barack Obama signed the landmark bill that 
allows homosexuals all over the na-tion to get married and claim the same rights as heterosexuals.
“This is an outrage, and I’m serious-
ly disappointed in President Obama’s 
administration for allowing such a heinous and immoral act to be seen 
as ‘OK’ in our society,” a park bench 
said. “I mean, how am I supposed to explain to my kid that there are two gay people holding hands while they sit on my face? And what’s next? Now the government has to let people marry animals, if they so choose!”
Seamus, gay rights activist and lo-
cal goat breeder (if you know what I 
mean), is totally OK with this.
“About time, laddies. I’ve been 
waiting fer’ this moment fer’ a long 
time now,” Seamus said as he dragged a goat to his local chapel. “Debbie and I have been dating since I was a wee lad and she a wee billy. Right, baby?”
Debbie declined to comment. How-
ever, not everyone is as enthusiastic about the new law as Seamus and Deb-bie. Religious members of the commu-nity are struggling with the concept. 
Samantha Smith, a leader of her local 
church, had a different opinion.
“Any reading of the Bible says that 
this is against the word of God. Any political acceptance of it will simply bring about the judgment of God faster. Acceptance represents a denial of what we as a Christian nation believe in, and nobody should try to force it upon us,” 
Smith said. “Oh crap,” she continued. 
“This was my speech on segregation from the ‘60s. My bad.”
Like-minded Republican politicians are already proposing laws in their re-spective states that would invalidate marriages among homosexual couples.
Some states are pleased by the new 
bill, though, and are widely accepting 
of its provisions.
The citizens of LeatherAssless-
Chapsville, formerly known as San 
Francisco, were seen celebrating in the streets when Obama signed the bill.
“This is the greatest news I’ve heard 
since ABBA decided to go back to have a reunion tour,” said homosexual citi-zen Stan Darsh.
Behind him, cars burned, babies 
cried and heterosexual marriages spon-taneously combusted. All remnants of the city’s society seemed to disappear in the hours just after the bill’s passing, and multiple citizens reported cases of noise pollution as celebrators blared “Mamma Mia” over loudspeakers

As a survivor of sexual assault, I’ve never felt 
more uncomfortable on the UF campus. I can’t walk to class withotut cringing at the teal rib-
bons littering Turlington and Plaza of the Americas, constant reminders of what I and so many others went 
through. Student Government has done this campus a 
disservice by triggering survivors with its poorly man-aged campaign and by perpetuating negative stereo-types that sexual assault is limited to a strange man grabbing a woman walking alone in the middle of the night and that victims should “prevent” sexual assault by not walking alone.
Sexual assault is not just a women’s issue; it affects 
everyone. SG’s campaign has completely excluded the 
queer community, children, intimate dating violence 
and male students from their inaccurate deﬁ  nition of sexual assault. Communities should not respond to sexual violence by simply telling women never to walk alone, but by telling people they cannot violate anoth-er’s personal space or they will risk being prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
I knew my attacker. Not walking alone would not 
have prevented my sexual assault. A narrow under-
standing of sexual assault silences and delegitimizes 
the millions of people who were sexually assaulted by someone they knew. It’s difﬁ  cult to come forward and report a sexual assault. It’s even more difﬁ  cult when victims are faced with accusing someone they know. I didn’t want to name my attacker for fear of retribution or that friends and family wouldn’t believe me. Young women also aren’t the only targets of sexual assault; 15 percent of victims are children under the age of 12 and 
10 percent are men. SG has failed to advocate for all 
victims of these terrible and brutal acts.
Sexual Assault Awareness Week could have been a 
positive force for change. The ribbons could have in-cluded positive messages such as “you are not alone” or “no means no” instead of the triggering “sexual assault awareness.” The messages of “don’t walk alone” could have shifted toward opportunities to remind students of safe nighttime transportation. SG could have hosted 
a candlelight vigil to honor survivors or had a male or 
queer-identiﬁ  ed, trans-inclusive speaker to reinforce that sexual assault affects everyone. It could have ex-panded counseling for survivors or passed a resolution funding legal counsel for every victim who reports an assault. Instead, this week has been triggering, miser-able and misinformed. In the future, SG should work to create events that represent every victim.
The recent attacks against four young women have 
been horrible acts of violence, and I hope the attacker is brought to justice. I hope we don’t allow this one man and SG’s response deﬁ  ne sexual assault and inﬂ  uence the views on this campus. I grappled for years with the legitimacy of my assault, and I don’t want others to blame themselves for not ﬁ  tting the mold created by SG.

assault campaignGuest column
I downloaded TapShield the other night on 
my bus ride home from campus.
The last two nights that I’ve been on cam-
pus, I’ve gripped a pocket knife in my hands, despite walking on a main road alongside many 
cars ﬁ  lled with people who could come to my 
aid in the event of an attack.
I’m not alone in these actions, either. This is 
the climate for women on campus right now.Whenever sexual assault comes into conversa-tion, the focus is on women.
Even with the gender-neutral advice offered in regards to 
the recent string of assaults by UF ofﬁ  cials and police repre-sentatives, the message is still clear — the attacker is target-
ing women, so women are the ones who must be concerned.
As such, there are many expectations for the average 
Gator girl now. Too much focus is put on what female stu-
dents should be doing to protect themselves and not, well, how to actually stop the attacks.
So, ladies, take a break. I’m turning the tables and telling 
everyone what to do in order to make assault less common.
To UF: Don’t tell women not to walk at night. Instead, in-
stall more lights on campus. Even the best-lit areas of campus 
are dim at night, which is the perfect environment for an at-
tacker to make his move in.
Don’t tell women to avoid scandalous clothing. Stop 
thinking of my short dress as an invitation to something I did not consent to or as a signal that I am sexually available.
Don’t tell women that it is their responsibility to prevent 
their own rape. Men, make your intolerance of assault so loud and apparent that your friends and peers feel unsafe contemplating violence against women. Voice your support 
of women so often that someone else would ﬁ  nd it inconceiv-
able to even think of assault in your presence.
It’s not enough to simply offer to walk a girl home at night if you turn around and laugh at a rape “joke” the next day. Allowing comments like “We totally raped Eastern Michigan on Saturday!” or “I just raped my chemistry exam” trivializes rape and makes possible attackers think their actions are 
OK and that their peers don’t object.
Instead, call people out. Don’t be a by-
stander in today’s rape culture, and don’t be 
wishy-washy. Be ﬁ  rm in your disapproval and actively work to make women feel safe.
Don’t tell women to be constantly aware of their sur-
roundings. Don’t tell them to avoid wearing headphones or talking on the phone. Instead, gentlemen, make your pres-ence abundantly clear. I have a male friend who told me that 
he’s made it a priority in the past few days to cross the street 
and walk on the opposite side so he doesn’t make a girl ap-prehensive by walking behind her.
If you are walking behind a female, make noise — jangle 
your keys, clear your throat — so that you don’t sneak up on someone and startle her. Do anything you can to alert wom-en of your presence as early as possible so they can register you and do whatever they need to feel safe.
Don’t continue to let sexual violence happen without edu-
cating people. UF needs to offer comprehensive sex educa-tion. The mandatory alcohol education course all students take before freshman year? Make everyone take one regard-ing healthy sexual practices and consent, as well.
These assaults and ones like them will continue until all of 
us, not just women, make a change. It isn’t enough to wear a longer skirt and to carry pepper spray.
Men, as well as school ofﬁ  cials, need to shoulder some 
responsibility as well. Sitting idly by while their friends, sig-
niﬁ  cant others and fellow Gators live in fear is not enough.

Thirteen years ago 
Thursday, our nation was shocked by vi-
cious attacks that struck a chord with virtually every 
American citizen who was old enough 
to be aware of what was happening. Though most of us were in second or third grade, we remember where we were and what we were doing on that day. From coast to coast, an incredible anger overtook the nation as U.S. citizens sought justice for the horriﬁ  c events that had unfolded before their eyes. Unfortu-
nately for many, that anger stopped not 
at the few who were responsible for the grievous crimes, but extended to every person who looked like them, sounded like them or even had a last name simi-lar to theirs. It is vitally important that we do not let the actions of a very small minority affect how we view an entire group of people.
It is important to remember that ev-
ery group of people has its share of radi-cals. Just as few Christians would want to be associated with the Crusades or the Ku Klux Klan, we should not judge all Muslims by the actions of a few just be-cause they used parts of their religion’s holy book to justify their actions. Recent-ly, I overheard a fellow white student at 
the University of Texas at Austin telling 
a friend that it was only a matter of time before the “ragheads” in the Middle East attack the U.S. again if the U.S. continues to support Israel in the Israeli-Palestin-ian conﬂ  ict in Gaza. The two continued to throw around this hurtful term multiple times in the conversation as they debated the feasibil-
ity of another large-scale terrorist attack from the Middle East. These statements, needless to say, generalize the actions of very few to a group of people who make up 23 percent of the world’s, and a sub-stantial part of UT’s, population.
Unfortunately, people with similar 
anti-Muslim feelings sometimes chan-nel their anger into action. There are 
hundreds of reported anti-Muslim hate 
crimes every year, but the Department of Justice predicts that the real number is in the thousands. Most of these crimes go unreported for a variety of reasons, namely that victims feel police will not do much in response. The number of these reports saw a huge spike after the attacks of 9/11. The saddest, most 
twisted part is that neither the victims 
nor the perpetrators of these crimes had anything to do with the attacks of 9/11, but the generalization of blame for the attacks leads to widespread hatred.
Individuals from all religions have 
committed crimes, and we should not let the sense of violation we feel from the 9/11 attacks taint our perception of the 
many Muslims throughout the world.

Sex can be fantastic. It can be 
terrible. It isn’t difﬁ  cult to look up details about sexual 
techniques or how to hook up. What’s not so easy is managing 
strong emotions and moments when decision-
making occurs.
Few people want to be hurt or cause hurt in 
a relationship, no matter how long it may last. Here are a few truisms to think about that may help you navigate the challenges of sexual intimacy. You aren’t going to want to believe them, but you should.
• Solo sex is the only safe sex. If you are 
comfortable engaging in masturbation, learn techniques that give you pleasure, and don’t be embarrassed to become an expert. Quite possibly, someday, you and a partner will ben-eﬁ  t from what you have learned.
• Sexual intimacy ALWAYS changes a rela-
tionship, and there’s no turning back. Don’t be in a hurry to add sex to the equation.
• The people who tend to attract us the most 
are almost always charismatic and attractive to others, as well. This means that they may have had previous partners and pose a risk of being the carrier of a sexually transmitted infection, whether they realize it or not.
• Even a well-meaning partner will not 
want to admit previous indiscretions. Don’t ask, “Have you always used condoms in the past?” Rather, ask: “Have you always, every 
time, without exception, used condoms with all previous partners?” The an-
swers to these questions are often different. And sometimes people honestly can’t remember.
• Unless you are the most 
beautiful, brilliant and charming person around, you have to realize that someone who is willing to have sex with you on your ﬁ  rst date or encounter has done this before. Prob-ably many times.
• Regardless of the oriﬁ  ce in use, mucous 
membrane contact carries some risk of bacteri-al and viral transmission, even when a partner truly feels uninfected. Beware, too, of “near in-
tercourse.” Once things get heated up, it’s very 
difﬁ  cult to resist the slippery slope.
• About contraception: If this is a concern 
(i.e., you are in a heterosexual relationship and view baby-making seriously), look into your options and use condoms with another meth-od to avoid scary moments of “forgetting.”
• It is tempting to trust a partner’s ﬁ  delity, 
but if the relationship decays, it is very difﬁ  cult 
for some people to admit they have had inter-
course with someone else. Even if you are sure that a relationship with intercourse (regardless of which oriﬁ  ce) will last forever, the impor-tant question to ask yourself is: If you break up with this person, how would you rather remember the relationship? With condoms or without?

� THEY WON FOR WORK ON 
DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION.
ALEXIA FERNANDEZ
Alligator Staff Writer
afernandez@alligator.org
Two UF doctors are continuing 
the legacy of conducting research 
that won their mentors the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award.
Dr. Michael Okun and Dr. Kelly 
Foote have worked with experts in deep brain stimulation: Dr. Mahlon DeLong, a neurologist at the Emory University School of Medicine, and Dr. Alim-Louis Benabid, professor of biophysics in Grenoble, France. 
“We once went to study with the 
masters, and now it seems that peo-ple assume that we are the masters,” Foote said.
Okun, professor of neurology at 
the UF Center for Movement Disor-ders and Neurorestoration, studied under DeLong, a man he described as “exceptional,” at Emory Univer-sity in the late 1990s.
“He is a world-class scientist,” 
Okun said. “I deﬁ  nitely have tried to model myself after him in as many ways as possible.”
DeLong, a neurologist, was the 
ﬁ  rst person to see how a part of the brain known as the basal ganglia af-fected Parkinson’s disease, accord-ing to a press release.
Foote, a UF neurosurgeon, said 
he is the only person to have studied under DeLong and Benabid.He had just completed a fellow-
ship in radiosurgery when Dr. Wil-liam Friedman, who worked with Foote at UF, offered him a position as a faculty member.
“He asked me what it would take 
to get me to stay,” he said. “I told him I really wanted to study deep 
brain stimulation in France with Dr. 
Benabid, so we came to an arrange-ment.”
The partnership between Okun 
and Foote has helped them achieve the dream they shared of creating a brain stimulation center at UF.
The Center for Movement Disor-ders and Neurorestoration, opened in 2002, helps more than 8,000 pa-tients, Okun said.
“We treat patients with all types 
of motion problems,” he said. “The majority will not get surgery, but they will get treatment.”
It’s more than he expected de-
cades after he met Okun, Foote said.
“I never would have imagined 
the level of success that we have had,” he said. “It’s been a pretty amazing ride. Honestly, I didn’t ex-pect my relationship with my friend Mike to be as important as it ended up being.”

will encounter in Palo Alto, Calif., with No. 4 Stanford (4-0-1) tonight at 10:30, as both teams meet after a 12-year matchless stint.
Florida has not had a problem 
scoring this season, but scoring against a team that has not al-lowed a goal this season is a new challenge.
“The better the teams we play, 
the better we’re going to be,” Mid-dleton said. “I’ve always thought that the only way to make myself a good player is by surrounding myself with the best players. One reason why I decided to play here and by playing a team like Stan-ford, all we can do is continue to get better and increase our conﬁ  -dence as long as we perform well in those games.”
Stanford has three shutout 
wins against ranked opponents this season. The fourth ranked 
opponent the Cardinal faced this 
year — then-No. 25 Notre Dame 
— ended in a 0-0 draw.
For Florida, this will be only 
the second ranked opponent it will face. 
But that notion does not deter-mine the result of the match. 
Rather, it creates a chance to 
make a statement.
“They’re good. They’re dynam-
ic,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “They play similar to us in some ways. But they’re loaded with tal-
ent. We respect what they’ve been 
able to do over the long haul.”
Three of Stanford’s under-
classmen were on the U.S. 2014 
FIFA Under-20 Women’s World Cup roster: sophomores Stepha-nie Amack and Jane Campbell as well as freshman Andi Sullivan. Florida’s only representative was Savannah Jordan.
Campbell, Stanford’s goal-
keeper, has not allowed a goal this season, while totaling 16 saves.
Stanford coach Paul Ratcliffe 
has said Campbell is regarded as one of the top young goalkeep-ers in the world — posing Florida with its largest offensive chal-lenge yet.
The Cardinal is also led by 
scorer Chioma Ubogagu, who has netted three of the team’s six goals this season.
Stanford has an upper hand 
on the amount of talent on their 
team, but creating an all-around 
system over individual standouts is Florida’s game plan.
“For us it’s about what play-
ers ﬁ  t us, not so much about what accolades they have,” Burleigh said. “It’s just exciting to go play a quality opponent.”
Although undefeated and full 
of national talent, the Cardinal will have to score more than its 1.2 goals-per-game average this season against the Gators.
Florida has averaged 2.4 goals 
per match, with eight of its play-ers contributing a goal this sea-son. Stanford has relied largely on Ubogagu’s offense.
UF has relied on a number of 
players as Jordan, Jillian Graff and Annie Speese have all man-aged to score multiple times.
In addition to the offense, Flor-
ida has compiled two conference offensive players of the week in Graff and midﬁ  elder Pamela Be-gic this season. Stanford has de-veloped none.
But both teams possess a great 
offense.
When the Gators score ﬁ  rst 
during a match this season, a vic-tory has resulted.
Stanford leads the series against 
Florida 2-0 and when the teams last 
met in 2002, the Cardinal routed 
the Gators 4-0. For the second con-secutive week, Florida will match up against a top-5 opponent. 
Stanford will be a chance to erase 
a losing streak that has lasted 
more than a decade.
“We always want to try and 
play the best teams we can just 
because I think it tells us a lot 
about ourselves,” Burleigh said. 
“It lets us know what we need to improve on or what we’re doing well.”
Gators strive to score against Cardinal

When Florida needed a point 
against San Diego on Thursday, it 
went to Rhamat Alhassan.
The 6-foot-4 freshman dominated 
the net against the Toreros, securing the first, second and third set points, and finished the night with 16 kills, 
one block and a .800 hitting percent-
age.
“I think what you’re seeing is the 
future,” coach Mary Wise said. “The thing that’s amazing is that it’s so 
early in her career, and watching the 
choices she makes around the block. ... She was pretty terrific.”
No. 10 Florida (4-2) shutout No. 13 
San Diego (5-2) 3-0, ending the Tore-ro’s four-game winning streak while capturing its first victory against a ranked opponent this season.
Florida ran out to an early 11-6 
lead in the first set before San Diego scored five straight points to tie the set. 
But behind freshmen Alhassan 
and Carli Snyder, who finished the night with eight kills on 13 attacks, Florida held the lead for the remain-der of the set to capture a 25-22 win. 
It was more of the same in the 
second set, as the Gators took a 25-19 victory. Alhassan had eight kills in the second set alone.
“We said from the very beginning 
(Rhamat) is a very good learner,” Wise said. “Her game will continue to evolve as she gets more playing experience with this group.”
The third set began neck and 
neck, as both teams traded leads from the start until halfway through. After UF pulled ahead 14-12, it held USD scoreless for the remainder of 
the match and cruised to a 25-12 vic-
tory.
“It was a pretty special perfor-
mance,” Wise said. “We’ve seen San Diego just wreak havoc on teams 
with their serve and it was the first 
time we’ve faced that type of deep server. … But we made great im-provements in the two practices we 
had this week.”
The win was Florida’s first shut-
out since Aug. 29 against Idaho. Florida is hoping for a similar 
outcome when they take on No. 6 
Southern California (6-0) tonight at 10:30 in its final match of the USC 
Classic. 
The Trojans are the second-high-
est ranked opponent the Gators have 
faced this season and feature two 6-foot-4 blockers in freshman Jordan Dunn and junior Alicia Ogums. 
USC also boasts All-American 
outside hitter Samantha Bricio, who has recorded more than half the team’s service aces this season with 20.
“We’re playing USC (tonight), 
who features some of the most tal-ented players in the country,” Wise said. “So it’s not getting any easier, 
but we look at this weekend as an-
other opportunity for our team to get better.”

Looking to continue its recent run of success at 
the Cougar Classic in Charleston, S.C., the Florida 
women’s golf team is preparing itself for the first 
tournament of fall. UF will be sending a lineup that 
includes former tournament champion, senior Ca-milla Hedberg, and freshman Taylor Tomlinson.
Hedberg won the individual portion of the Cou-
gar Classic in 2012 when she shot 13-under-par and was four strokes ahead of second-place finisher Lin-dy Duncan of Duke. 
Hedberg struggled at the tournament last season, 
as she finished 10-over-par, but she is using her per-formance from last year as the motivation she needs to bounce back and repeat her winning play in the fall.
“It’s my senior year, so I kind of want to end on a 
good note and play good golf,” Hedberg said.
For Hedberg, the individual championship in 
Charleston was her first collegiate title. It came her 
sophomore year, where at one point she was rated 
as the No. 1 women’s golfer in the country by Golf-week. She ended up being awarded first-team South-eastern Conference honors that season.
Taylor Tomlinson on the other hand will be mak-
ing her collegiate debut. 
The Gainesville native comes to UF with high ex-
pectations as she was ranked No. 2 in the state of Florida and No. 10 in Golfweek’s girls’ junior rank-
ing for the 2014 class. Tomlinson said she has been 
embraced by her teammates in the first week leading up to the tournament and she is ready to go.
“They’ve really taken me in and gotten really 
close with them,” Tomlinson said, “so it’s going to 
be a really good time with them and seeing what I 
can do and what our team can do.”
UF has won back-to-back titles as a team at 
Charleston and will be looking for a third consecu-
tive title.
Hedberg said the team is preparing for a possible 
three-peat by staying within themselves and taking 
the tournament one day at a time.
“We’re pretty calm about it, we don’t want to talk 
too much about goals, obviously all of us want to win, but we don’t want to go there having that in mind,” Hedberg said. “We just want to focus on the process and go step by step and do what we got to 
do and then give the best we have.”Hedberg leads

Alligator Staff Writer @J_McPherson1126
At the start of the season, Flor-
ida had three running backs listed 
as the possible starters for its sea-son opener against Eastern Michi-
gan — Matt Jones, Kelvin Taylor 
and Mack Brown.
All three averaged a minimum 
of 45.2 yards per game on the 
ground in 2013 and reached the 
end zone at least twice.
And after Florida’s 65-0 win 
to kickoff the season, it’s still too 
close to decide who will break out as the Gators’ leading tailback.
The trio combined for 191 
rushing yards on just 22 carries, with each gaining no more than 68 yards or garnering more than eight rushing attempts.
“Everybody feeds off each 
other,” Taylor said. “We see one do good and then I’ll want to do good. … We’re like brothers out there, so we go out there and just 
work hard.”
All three of Jones, Taylor and 
Brown had a rush of at least 31 
yards against Eastern Michigan.
On UF’s second drive against 
the Eagles, Taylor needed just one play to ﬁ  nd a seam and break free, 
going 31 yards for a touchdown. 
One offensive drive later, Jones 
found paydirt for the ﬁ  rst time this season after a 40-yard run.
Brown pulled out a 47-yard 
run in the third quarter — 15 yards longer than his previous career long set during Florida’s 19-14 loss to South Carolina on Nov. 16.
“I thought it was pretty cool 
how all the running backs got up there and had a nice game, you know, broke a few times,” right guard Trenton Brown said. “I love blocking for those guys. You never know if they can break a big play at any moment. So that’s one of the good things about blocking for some big playmak-ers cause you know that just gives you more drive to do your job at a high level.”
Moving forward in the season, 
coach Will Muschamp will contin-ue to rotate his deep group of run-ning backs, with Taylor and Jones getting the bulk of the load.
“They’re fun to be around, 
they’re fun to coach. But they un-derstand the big picture of this thing and we’re going to be play-ing 75-80 snaps a game,” Mus-champ said. “They’re going to have their opportunities. They’ve got to make their opportunities count. They understand we’re go-ing to go with the guy with the hot hand, but we need both of them.”
And in addition to the three main backs, Florida also has true 
freshman Brandon Powell, red-
shirt freshman Adam Lane and ju-nior Mark Herndon at its disposal 
in the backﬁ  eld.
“It’s nice to have that many, 
but at the same time you want to 
get them all touches and that’s not always realistic,” quarterback Jeff 
Driskel said. “But I’m very conﬁ  -
dent in all of them. They all know 
what they’re doing. They all play 
hard, and they’re all rooting for each other, which is huge back 
there.”
Powell made the most of his 
ﬁ  rst career rushing attempt, scam-pering 12 yards into the endzone 
to give the Gators a 24-0 lead early 
in the second quarter.
Herndon ran for just 11 yards 
on three rushing attempts, but the Ocala native scored on a screen 
pass from backup quarterback 
Treon Harris, running 78 yards to paydirt in the fourth quarter.
Lane, who was not in atten-
dance for Florida’s season opener 
due to a family situation, showed 
ﬂ  ashes of potential throughout training camp.
In the Orange & Blue Debut, the 
redshirt freshman led all runners 
with 76 yards of total offense.
“I feel like Lane, he’s going to 
bring a lot to the offense,” Taylor 
said. “He’s very powerful, he’s 
going to get us those hard yards: 
3rd and 2, 3rd and 3, 3rd and 5 - 
Lane can drive. He can drive easy 
for ﬁ  ve yards, when he falls for-
ward he’s got ridiculous power. 
He’s a very good guy and I’m 
looking forward to see Lane do 
great things this year.”
With Florida’s Southeastern 
Conference opener against Ken-
tucky at 7:30 p.m. Saturday, the 
Gators will need their running 
back stable at its best.
Through two games, the Wild-
cats have given up an average of 
just 128.5 yards on the ground per 
contest.
Kentucky also has a knack for 
penetrating the backﬁ  eld, evi-
denced by its 13 tackles for loss.
“I feel like they play hard,” 
Taylor said. “I mean, it’s SEC ball so it should. It’s going to be a physical game. It’s going to be a hard game. I feel like we could 
run the ball pretty good on them, 
and we’re just going to play our 
game.”3, KICKOFF, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 12, 2014
