RECORDS SHOW SOME CASES 
WEREN’T HANDLED CORRECTL Y 
BY FACULTY
By Hope Dean
Alligator Staff Writer
Openlettertodeanperri.com is exactly what 
it appears to be: an open letter to Michael Perri, 
the dean of UF’s College of Public Health and 
Health Professions. 
But 100 pages of two UF sexual assault cas-
es within Perri’s college lie in another tab, and 
31- year-old Andrew Cistola, a second-year UF 
masters and ﬁ  rst-year doctoral student in pub-
lic health, isn’t ﬁ  nished collecting records. 
UF’s Title IX ofﬁ  ce has investigated a clus-
ter of sexual assault cases from the college 
within the past two years, and records show 
that some cases weren’t handled correctly by faculty, Cistola said. 
This makes Cistola “extremely concerned” 
for the safety of students, he wrote in a letter 
on the site he created, which is why on Dec. 
23 he requested that Perri release public docu-
mentation of the cases by Jan. 6.
Cistola told The Alligator he made the web-
site to dispel rumors about the cases spreading 
through the halls of the college. He also said he 
doesn’t want any sexual predators attached to 
the research projects he has to complete at UF 
because it could damage his career. 
“I wanted to make sure that students, facul-
ty, staff, alumni and community members can 
have access to public information so they can 
make their own decisions about their safety – 
about who they want to work with,” Cistola 
told The Alligator in an interview. 
Perri did not follow through with the re-
quest. When The Alligator pressed him on 
why, he referred a reporter to UF spokesperson Steve Orlando. 
“We are conﬁ  dent that the university’s Title 
IX ofﬁ  ce handled these cases properly,” Orlan-
do wrote in a statement.
When Cistola asked Perri for documenta-
tion of the cases and to publicly release these 
related documents, Perri instead responded by 
making a public records request for Cistola to 
ﬁ  nd the information he was looking for.  
Cistola then published Perri’s response to 
the website Monday, in which Perri also for-
warded Cistola to Russell Froman, UF’s Title IX 
director. Froman declined to comment. 
“I appreciate your concern for the welfare 
of the College and its students. I know that Dr. 
Froman will do his best to address your con-
cerns while respecting the conﬁ  dentiality re-
quired in these matters,” Perri wrote to Cistola 
in an email. 
The front page of openlettertodeanperri.
com now shows Cistola’s pubic response to Perri. Cistola wrote that Perri did not comply 
with his original demands and expects the re-
ports to be sent in by Feb. 1.
“Tell us a story. Tell us what’s going on. 
The reason why I felt it was so important is 
because we had no idea what was going on,” 
Cistola told The Alligator. 
“Release these documents, please”: 
what’s in the letter
Cistola wrote about three cases in his intial 
letter posted on the website that sparked his 
concerns. 
The ﬁ  rst is the case of Andrew Lotto, a for-
mer professor in the college that Perri let resign 
after the university conducted an investigation 
that found multiple incidents of sexual harass-
ment against female students and faculty dat-
ing back more than two years.

BUSINESSES CAN BE 
FINED $250 FOR HAVING 
PLASTIC STRAWS
By Grethel Aguila
Alligator Staff Writer
Most Gainesville residents won’t 
be ﬁ  nding single-use plastic straws 
at stores or restaurants any longer. 
A plastic straw ban ofﬁ  cially be-
gan to be enforceed in Gainesville 
on Jan. 2. In August, city com-
missioners voted to ban single-use 
plastic straws and stirrers from res-
taurants and stores. The ordinance 
doesn’t apply to hospitals, nursing 
homes, assisted living facilities or 
people with disabilities. 
The ban is part of the city com-
mission’s plan to make Gainesville 
waste-free by 2040. 
City Commissioner David Arre-
ola, who voted in favor of the ban, 
said he hopes it raises awareness of 
the waste produced by our society 
and the impacts of everyday con-sumerism. 
Businesses that don’t adhere 
to the ban will receive verbal and 
written warnings, and those with 
written warnings will receive cita-
tions until they comply, Arreola 
said. The Code of Ordinances lists 
the ﬁ  ne amount at $250. 
“We’re talking about straws — 
just do the right thing,” Arreola 
said. 
Arreola said he doesn’t think 
Gainesville’s straw ban will suf-
fer the same fate as the single-use 
plastics ban, which was repealed 
following The Florida Retail Fed-
eration’s lawsuit against the city of 
Coral Cables in 2016. In May, Gov. 
Ron DeSantis vetoed a bill for a 
statewide prohibition of local straw 
bans.
Satchel’s Pizza, located at 1800 
NE 23rd Ave., received a warning 
about its straws back in October.

the city issued a warning to the res-The last straw: ban takes eﬀ  ect

ENTOMOLOGY AND 
NEMATOLOGY DEPARTMENT 
OFFERS NEW ONLINE 
BEEKEEPING II CLASS 
By Marlowe Starling
Alligator Contributing Writer
A new online beekeeping class 
being offered this Spring is the bee’s 
knees for students with a sweet spot 
for an unusual hobby. Beekeeping II, under the course 
codes ENY4932 for undergraduates 
and ENY6934 for post-graduates, of-
fers more foundational knowledge 
to beekeeping than its predecessors, 
Beekeeping I and Practical Beekeep-
ing, said Cameron Jack,  entomol-
ogy and nematology lecturer. 
“Beekeeping brings people 
together from all different back-
grounds and all walks of life,” Jack 
said. “It’s not really for people just interested in agriculture.”
Students interested in agricul-
tural ﬁ  elds at land grant universities 
like UF typically take classes, get in-
ternships and then enter the indus-
try, Jack said. 
“Really, nothing exists like that 
for beekeeping anywhere in the 
United States, so we’re kind of try-
ing something new,” he said. 
Other new classes are expected 
to give students more knowledge of 
beekeeping in hopes of eventually 
introducing a certiﬁ  cate students 
can earn, Jack said. A new study abroad program this Summer will 
focus on beekeeping in Thailand, 
and a honey bee biology class will 
be introduced in Fall.   
“We want students to walk away 
with a piece of paper that says they 
know how to keep bees and are pro-
ﬁ  cient at doing it,” Jack said. 
Carson Beattie, a 21-year-old UF 
geology senior, is registered in the 
new class this semester. Beattie also 
worked as a teaching assistant for 
the practical beekeeping class over 
the Summer. 
“When you really get to work with them hands-on, most people 
are really afraid of them, but it’s 
actually the opposite,” Beattie said. 
“They’re really good animals to 
work with.”
While Beattie said he is only in-
terested in beekeeping as a hobby, 
he appreciates its environmental 
beneﬁ  ts. 
“Agriculturally, some crops, like 
almonds in California, are 100 per-
cent pollinated by bees,” he said. 
“Without commercial growers com-
ing in to pollinate the almond crop, What’s all the buzz about?SEE OPEN LETTER,  PAGE 3

The second case includes two related in-
vestigations from the same college concerning 
Sheena Pryce Fegumps and Christy Ewing, two 
professors who are accused of sexually harass-
ing a male professor within the same college, 
Mark Hart. The 100 pages of records on Cis-
tola’s website include multiple incidents from 
2017 to 2019.
Hart declined to comment for this article.
Hart’s case ﬁ  les also state that Cindy Prins, 
the college’s assistant dean for educational af-
fairs, and Amy Blue, the college’s associate 
dean for educational affairs, broke Title IX 
guidelines by not reporting Hart’s case imme-
diately.  
“Any employee with supervisory responsi-
bility, as well as faculty who have knowledge 
of sexual harassment, is required to promptly 
report the matter directly to the Title IX Coor-
dinator and may be disciplined for failing to do 
so,” the UF employee handbook reads.When asked for comment, Prins and Blue 
forwarded a reporter to Orlando, who declined 
to comment on whether or not they were disci-
plined or if Pryce Fegumps and Ewing are still 
employed at UF. 
The Alligator also reached out to Pryce 
Fegumps and Ewing, but they did not respond 
before publication.
However, the college’s website lists all four 
in their same positions. Its last update was on 
Jan. 8. 
Cistola alleges that a third case is still un-
derway and involves workplace discrimina-
tion against females and verbal harassment by 
the same male professor over the last several 
years, Cistola wrote in his letter. The report is 
not on the website and The Alligator could not 
individually conﬁ  rm its existence. 
Cistola said he has worked with Emma 
Crowley, a 24-year-old UF master’s student in 
public health and sexual assault survivor, to 
make sure he treats the subject with care on 
his website.  
Crowley said her sexual assault case was 
ignored by the Title IX ofﬁ  ce at her under-
graduate institution, which she did not wish to 
name. This is why she’s passionate about mak-
ing sure UF practices transparency in its cases.
“We don’t want to seem aggressive,” Crow-
ley said. “That’s not our intention. And that’s 
why Andrew wrote this letter almost as an 
invitation, saying, ‘Release these documents, 
please, so we can get a better understanding of 
what we’re dealing with.’” 
But Crowley and Cistola aren’t the only 
ones concerned with transparency in the de-
partment.
  
“I don’t know who to trust,”: students 
react to the website
In November, Alejandra Salemi, a 22-year-
old second-year public health masters student, 
collected about 15 letters from students in sup-
port of Hart during his sexual harassment case. 
Hart was demoted from his former posi-
tions as the college’s director of online learning and the director of the college’s doctoral and 
masters programs in public health for the so-
cial behavioral sciences concentration after 
an argument with college ofﬁ  cials related to 
his case, and his students were feeling the 
loss, Salemi said. 
He helped everyone ﬁ  nd job and re-
search opportunities and acted as a mentor 
to his students. She added that she lost all 
her respect for the college. 
“I don’t know who to trust,” she said. 
“I’m worried about graduating on time. I 
don’t know who to go to for my complaints 
and my concerns.” 
Salemi said she supports Cistola’s web-
site because it calls the college administra-
tion out for letting Lotto resign instead of 
ﬁ  ring him and allowing two deans to not 
report Hart’s case for years. 
“We’re showing them that we are not go-
ing to put up with their bull****,” she said. 
“That website — and us students — who 
are vocal about it is just only reinforcing that 
we’re here to stay and ﬁ  ght.” 
And other students are willing to speak 
out as well. 
Everything was thrilling and new when 
Valentina Fandino, a 22-year-old ﬁ  rst-year 
UF master’s student, started studying pub-
lic health with a concentration in social and 
behavioral sciences. Professors had open 
-door policies, and you could talk to anyone, 
anytime.
But the hallways are quiet now, with al-
most every door shut. 
“It feels like we’re being closed out. I deﬁ  -
nitely see the silence,” she said. 
Fandino also lost Hart as her adviser with-
out warning when he was demoted, which she 
said has been interruptive to her research.  
The fact that Hart’s case wasn’t properly re-
ported makes Fandino concerned for students.
“How many students have walked through 
those doors, experienced sexual harassment, 
reported it and nothing was ever done?” she 
said. “It’s very important to have those people who you can come and talk to when people 
will believe you and listen to you. And just the 
thought of our students and our staff to not be 
able to have that is terrifying.” 
Fandino hopes the college will publish all 
the cases to make sure students know about 
what’s going on and represent public health 
the way it should be.
“No issue is black and white, but we really 
just need to be honest about where we stand 
and what we’re doing to improve things if we 
actually want to be a top-ﬁ  ve public univer-
sity,” she said.

taurant, saying it had until Jan. 2 to 
get rid of its plastic straws.
Satchel Raye, the owner of the 
Gainesville pizza shop, declined to 
comment on the ban to The Alligator. 
While the ordinance states that 
it excludes those with disabilities, 
there is still a possibility that some 
businesses don’t have plastic straws 
readily available. 
Gerry Altamirano, the assistant 
dean and director of UF’s Disability 
Resource Center, said people must 
consider the intersection between sustainability and accessibility.  
Altamirano said students with dis-
abilities have shared concerns with 
the DRC about not having access to 
plastic straws. 
The DRC has advocated for straws 
at Broward Dining for students with 
disabilities, as some shared concerns 
about not having access to plastic 
straws, said Altamirano. 
“An issue with sustainability is 
that it causes people to forget indi-
viduals with disabilities,” Altamirano 
said.   
Altamirano said he believes in-
novation is key to bridging the gap 
between these two concepts. One of his ideas, he said, is to redesign 
single-use cups with built-in straws 
to reduce plastic waste.
Life Unplastic, a shop specializing 
in plastic-free, compostable and bio-
degradable items, is one of the local 
leaders of the sustainability move-
ment. 
The store’s owner, Joy Hughes, 
wrote in an email to The Alligator 
that she hopes the ban shows people 
the value in changing from a culture 
of convenience to one that respects 
reusable ways. 
“Plastic is toxic and persistent, so 
while the ban might be spoken about 
negatively by some people, I think of it as an ice breaker for communities,” 
Hughes wrote.
Hughes also wrote that she be-
lieves plastic pollution should be 
curbed at the source — essentially 
before it even becomes a product. 
She compared changes at a consum-
er level to mopping up water from an 
overﬂ  owing tub. 
“The work must be done, but we 
won’t be able to see real change until 
we turn off the tap,” Hughes wrote.

Beattie also helps at the UF Institute 
of Food and Agricultural Sciences Hon-
ey Bee Research and Extension Lab, 
testing whether pesticides have an ef-
fect on bees drifting to other colonies. 
To do so, students painted the bees 
they were testing different colors — all 
by hand. 
In Florida, there are nearly 5,000 
registered beekeepers. Of those, 10 per-
cent are commercial beekeepers and 
the rest are hobbyists, Jack said. 
For students who may not have 
room in their schedules for beekeeping 
classes, a UF Honey Bee Club is open to 
all majors. 
“Bees are something for everybody,” 
Jack said.STRAW BAN,  from pg. 1

Dignity Village stopped accepting new residents in October. 
The city expected to close the camp Jan. 1, but the plan is 
taking longer than expected. 
ALACHUA COUNTY WILL 
FOCUS ON OTHER HOUSING 
INTERVENTIONS
By Samantha Chery
Alligator Staff Writer
Dignity Village may be shutting 
down, but the city of Gainesville has 
a new plan to keep hope alive for the 
homeless.
For years, residents of the homeless 
encampment have used the services 
provided by GRACE Marketplace, a 
homeless shelter. But as the population 
rapidly grew, the promise of housing 
solutions dwindled, said Jon DeCar-
mine, the shelter’s executive director.
“Dignity Village was an idea with 
a lot of potential, but there was never 
enough staffing or resources,” he said.
DeCarmine said the city of 
Gainesville stopped accepting new 
residents in October as part of the long-
term effort to close the campground. 
At the time, there were more than 200 
people living in Dignity Village.Shelby Taylor, the communications 
director for the city of Gainesville, said 
it “served no one’s best interest” for 
Gainesville’s homeless to live in a tent 
city outdoors.
“We continued to witness, over the 
past few years, deteriorating living con-
ditions around that area,” Taylor said.
While Dignity Village was sched-
uled to close on Jan. 1, the city’s plan 
was delayed by the construction of the 
perimeter fence around Dignity Village. 
The fence is expected to be completed 
in the next 30 days, Taylor said.
Following the completion of the 
fence, city officials hope to create a 
campground at the shelter for residents 
to get help in finding the necessary 
housing to fit their situation, she said.
In October, Taylor said nearly 70 
percent of Dignity Village’s homeless 
population said they had viable living 
alternatives when surveyed.
“We’re trying to connect people 
with the resources that they need so 
that we can move these people in a 
more positive direction,” she said.In recent months, Alachua County 
increased its contribution to housing ef-
forts to $1.5 million, the Alachua Coun-
ty spokesperson Mark Sexton said.
Sexton said that while the county 
commission has been very supportive 
of GRACE Marketplace and Dignity Vil-
lage, they feel as though the time has 
come to focus on and prioritize housing 
solutions.
He said the county’s plan is to 
gradually lower its contribution to 
GRACE Marketplace, leave the city of 
Gainesville in charge of its funding and 
focus their attention on other housing 
interventions — rapid re-housing and 
permanent supportive housing.
“There’s only one way, when you 
boil everything down, to end home-
lessness, and that’s to put people in 
homes,” Sexton said.

THE REWARD WAS RECENTL Y 
INCREASED FROM 
$8,000 TO $10,000 
By Sarah Mandile
Alligator Staff Writer
Nearly a decade after the unsolved mur-
der of Lila Leach, a billboard has been un-
veiled in Newberry listing a new reward 
and updated information about the cold 
case. 
On Thursday, Alachua County Sher-
iff’s Office and Leach’s family members 
unveiled the new billboard, located near 
the Park-and-Ride Lot on West Newberry Road. 
In July 2010, 96-year-old Leach was at-
tacked inside her Newberry home and died 
later as a result of the injuries she sus-
tained.  
The large sign displays a photo of Leach 
wearing a floral blouse and reclining in a 
wooden chair. In bold, red lettering, the 
billboard reads: “Victim of Murder.”
Sgt. Frank Kinsey, a spokesman for the 
sheriff’s office, said he hopes the billboard 
raises awareness about the case.
The billboard lists the reward amount 
at $8,000, but Kinsey said it was recently 
increased to $10,000. He said the sign will 
be updated in a few days to reflect this.
“The billboard has the power to gen-erate conversation in Newberry,” Kinsey 
said. “We hope it will challenge someone 
to do the right thing.”
During Thursday’s press conference, 
ACSO Sheriff Sadie Darnell revealed that 
advances in DNA technology have allowed 
the sheriff’s office to narrow their search. 
She said investigators now have enough in-
formation to eliminate 19 suspects.
Leach’s daughter Elaine May was pres-
ent at the conference and encouraged any-
one with information about the case to 
come forward. She said this billboard is the 
third one they’ve put up for her mother. 
May said Leach was lively, feisty, funny 
and loved to watch travel programs. She 
was the “ringleader of the family,” she said.
May said she’d like a chance to talk to 
the perpetrator and let them know that 
they can come forward and share their side 
of the story. 
“If someone came forward, we could 
all begin to do some unburdening,” May 
said. “I know my mother has forgiven him. 
I know I have forgiven him.” 
Anyone with information about this 
case is encouraged to contact Alachua 
County Sheriff’s Office Investigator Kevin 
Allen at 352-384-3323.

The UF Small Animal Hospital discovered that Nancy, a sulcata tortoise, is allergic to 
orchardgrass hay. 
SHE IS ALLERGIC TO 
ORCHARDGRASS HAY 
By Anna Wilder
Alligator Staff Writer
The UF Small Animal Hospi-
tal never encountered a tortoise 
with allergies — until Nancy was 
brought in.
Nancy, a sulcata tortoise, was 
brought into the hospital by an 
anonymous Gainesville resident 
in October, said Amy Alexander, 
a clinical assistant professor of 
zoological medicine.Alexander noticed that part 
of Nancy’s eyelids were swollen, 
which led the zoological medicine 
team to discover something that 
UF had never documented before: 
a tortoise with an allergy.
Alexander said she recalled 
asking herself if Nancy could 
be allergic to hay after leaving 
the tortoise near an armadillo’s 
enclosure. To test this, she put 
Nancy in a separate room away 
from the hay, and within a day, 
Nancy’s eyes were back to nor-
mal. Veterinary dermatology ser-
vices at the hospital performed an allergy skin test on Nancy for the 
three most common types of hay 
in Florida: orchardgrass, timothy 
and alfalfa, Alexander said. They 
found the tortoise is allergic to or-
chardgrass hay.
She said dermatology services 
conﬁ  rmed the allergy after they 
injected the orchardgrass hay and 
her eyelids swelled up.
Alexander is planning to docu-
ment Nancy’s orchardgrass al-
lergy in a peer-reviewed 
journal publication.
At the time, Nancy 
still didn’t have a home. Alexander listed Nancy on Pet-
ﬁ  nder and contacted animal shel-
ters but was unsuccessful.
“These types of tortoises are 
native to Africa but common to 
the pet trade in the U.S., and the 
issue with them is that they are 
really great escape artists because 
of their strong legs,” Alexander 
said. “They burrow out of peo-
ple’s yards, so it’s actually not 
uncommon to have stray sulcata tortoises, but they are not meant 
to be here.”
The zoological medicine ser-
vice team searched for a home for 
Nancy for months until Marley 
Iredale, a veterinarian and ana-
tomic pathology resident at UF 
Small Animal Hospital, decided 
to adopt Nancy.
“She’s settled in really well,” 
Iredale said. “She seems to enjoy 
being outside instead of in the 
hospital.”

Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce 
deputies are investigating a string of 
burglaries in the Longleaf subdivi-
sion in southwest Gainesville.
Art Forgey, a sheriff’s ofﬁ  ce 
spokesperson, said the incidents 
took place overnight Friday, and 
Longleaf residents woke up Saturday 
morning to ﬁ  nd their cars burglar-
ized. He wrote in an email that 17 
cars were broken into, and all but 
one were unlocked.
On Monday, WCJB TV20 shared 
home surveillance video in the Long-
leaf subdivision. The footage re-
vealed a group of suspects approach-
ing several cars on the night of the 
burglaries. 
Forgey said pocket change, small 
electronics and personal items such as a wallet and purse were taken 
during these burglaries.
Two vehicles were stolen and 
have not yet been recovered, Forgey 
said. Both vehicles have been placed 
into a national database system used 
by law enforcement as the investiga-
tion continues, he wrote.
Detectives are still working the 
cases and analyzing evidence foren-
sically, Forgey said.
“We are also trying to push infor-
mation out reminding people to lock 
their cars, don’t leave valuables in-
side or keys,” Forgey wrote.
Forgey said no arrests were made 
as of Thursday evening.

More than 50 years ago, Mexican 
American high school students in the 
southwestern part of the U.S. walked 
out of schools to protest the removal 
of their culture from their schools’ 
curriculums. 
It was the start of Latinx studies, 
said Nicholas Vargas, a UF professor 
who’s teaching a class on the topic 
in the UF Institute of Hispanic-Latino 
Cultures’ new space since its reopen-ing in November. This is the first 
class to ever be held in the space, as 
of Wednesday. 
“They walked out so we can walk 
in,” Vargas told students at the porch 
of the institute — better known as 
La Casita — after about 20 students 
made a symbolic trek from Little Hall 
to the institute Wednesday afternoon 
to honor the student leaders.
Vargas, a professor at UF’s Center 
for Latin American Studies and the 
department of sociology, criminology 
and law, will teach the Introduction to Latinx Studies class every Mon-
day, Wednesday and Friday at 3 p.m. 
throughout the rest of the spring se-
mester. 
The class, which students have to 
register for on ONE.UF, will focus on 
issues related to Latinx cultural iden-
tity and provide students with great-
er knowledge of how Latinx people 
have contributed to the foundation of 
the U.S., Vargas said. There are still 
a limited number of seats open for 
the class.La Casita hosts class on Latinx studies

WASHINGTON (AP) — It is 
“highly likely” that Iran shot 
down the civilian Ukrainian jet-
liner that crashed near Tehran 
late Tuesday, killing all 176 peo-
ple on board, U.S., Canadian and 
British officials declared Thurs-
day. They said the fiery missile 
strike could well have been a 
mistake amid rocket launches 
and high tension throughout the 
region.
The crash came just a few 
hours after Iran launched a bal-
listic attack against Iraqi mili-
tary bases housing U.S. troops 
in its violent confrontation with 
Washington over the U.S. drone 
strike that killed an Iranian Rev-
olutionary Guard general. The 
airliner could have been mistak-
en for a threat, said four U.S. of-
ficials, speaking on condition of 
anonymity to discuss sensitive 
intelligence.
Canadian Prime Minister Jus-
tin Trudeau, whose country lost 
at least 63 citizens in the down-
ing, said in Ottawa: “We have 
intelligence from multiple sourc-
es including our allies and our 
own intelligence. The evidence 
indicates that the plane was shot 
down by an Iranian surface-to-
air missile.” 
U.K. Prime Minister Boris 
Johnson and Australian Prime 
Minister Scott Morrison offered 
similar statements. Morrison 
also said it appeared to be a mis-
take. “All of the intelligence as 
presented to us today does not 
suggest an intentional act,” he 
said.
The assessment that 176 
people were killed as collateral 
damage in the Iranian-U.S. con-
flict cast a new pall over what 
had at first appeared to be rela-
tively calm aftermath following 
the U.S. military operation that 
killed Iranian Gen. Qassem So-
leimani.
It was not immediately clear how the U.S. and its allies would 
react. Despite efforts by Wash-
ington and Tehran to step back 
from the brink of possible war, 
the region remained on edge af-
ter the killing of the Iranian gen-
eral and Iran’s retaliatory mis-
sile strikes. U.S. troops were on 
high-alert.
At the White House, Presi-
dent Donald Trump suggested 
he believed Iran was responsible 
for the shootdown and dismissed 
Iran’s initial claim that it was a 
mechanical issue with the plane.
Late Thursday, the U.S. 
House approved a measure that 
aims to bar any further military 
action against Iran without con-
gressional approval. However, 
the resolution approved by the 
Democratic-majority House is 
nonbinding and no similar mea-
sure could pass the Republican-
controlled Senate.
As for the airliner shootdown, 
U.S. officials wouldn’t say what 
intelligence they had that point-
ed to an Iranian missile, believed 
to be fired by Russian Tor sys-
tem, known to NATO as the SA-
15. But they acknowledged the 
existence of satellites and other 
sensors in the region, as well as 
the likelihood of communication 
interceptions and other similar 
intelligence.
The New York Times posted 
a video Thursday it said it had 
verified showing the moment the 
apparent missile struck the plane 
over Iran. The video shows a 
fast-moving object rising before 
a fiery explosion. An object, ap-
parently on fire, then continues 
in a different direction.
A preliminary Iranian inves-
tigative report released Thurs-
day said that the airliner pilots 
never made a radio call for help 
and that the aircraft was trying 
to turn back for the airport when 
the burning plane went down. 
The Iranian report suggested 
a sudden emergency struck the 
Boeing 737 operated by Ukrai-
nian International Airlines late 
Tuesday, when it crashed, just 
minutes after taking off from Imam Khomeini International 
Airport in Tehran. 
Investigators from Iran’s Civil 
Aviation Organization offered 
no immediate explanation for 
the disaster, however. Iranian 
officials initially blamed a tech-
nical malfunction for the crash, 
something backed by Ukrainian 
officials before they said they 
wouldn’t speculate amid an on-
going investigation. 
Before the U.S. assessment, 
Iran’s state-run IRNA news 
agency quoted Hasan Rezaeifa, 
the head of the of civil aviation 
accident investigation commis-
sion, claiming that “the topics 
of rocket, missile or anti-aircraft 
system is ruled out.”
The Ukrainian International 
Airlines took off at 6:12 a.m. 
Wednesday, Tehran time, after 
nearly an hour’s delay at Teh-
ran’s Imam Khomeini Airport, 
the main airport for travelers in 
Iran. It gained altitude heading 
west, reaching nearly 8,000 feet, 
according to both the report and 
flight-tracking data. 
Then something went wrong, 
“no radio messages were re-
ceived from the pilot regarding 
unusual situations,” the report 
said. In emergencies, pilots 
reach out to air-traffic control-
lers to warn them and to clear 
the runway for their arrival, 
though their first priority is to 
keep the aircraft flying.
Eyewitnesses, including the 
crew of another flight pass-
ing above, described seeing the 
plane engulfed in flames before 
crashing at 6:18 a.m., the report 
said. The crash caused a mas-
sive explosion when the plane 
hit the ground, likely because 
the aircraft had been fully loaded 
with fuel for the flight to Kyiv, 
Ukraine. 
The report also confirmed 
that both of the “black boxes” 
that contain data and cockpit 
communications from the plane 
had been recovered, though they 
sustained damage and some 
parts of their memory was lost.Iranians shot down airliner, 
Western leaders declare
At the end of every semester, 
13 men and women get together to 
decide how to impact the university 
community every day. 
Six are appointed by the gover-
nor of Florida, and five by the Flori-
da Board of Governors. The Student 
Body president and the chairperson 
of the Faculty Senate also serve as 
representatives of UF students and 
staff, UF spokesperson Steve Or-
lando said. 
This is the Board of Trust-
ees. Eleven men and two women 
make up the current board, many 
of whom are highly ranked within 
their professions. 
Take Morteza “Mori”  Hosseini, 
for example, the board’s chair-
man: Hosseini is the creator of ICI 
Homes, one of Florida’s largest 
construction companies. Thomas 
Kuntz, the board’s vice chair, was 
a former chairman, president and 
CEO of SunTrust Bank, Florida. 
Professions in law, medicine 
and business make up some of the 
remaining board members’ creden-
tials. 
Board members act as university 
ambassadors, said Jason Rosen-
berg, a trustee and reconstructive 
microsurgeon. They are well-con-
nected individuals from all across 
the state, and they help to lobby the 
Florida legislature for its support of 
campus initiatives. 
These initiatives are decided 
upon by UF President Kent Fuchs 
and his team and are then approved 
by the Board of Trustees. Adminis-
trators and volunteers present these 
to the legislature and negotiate for 
the funds to carry them out, Rosen-
berg said. 
In addition to alumni donations 
and private fundraising, these state 
funds make up a large part of the 
university’s budget. Things like 
classroom renovations, faculty pay, 
research funds and tuition costs are 
all determined by how much money the lobbiers bring in, Orlando said. 
It is the trustees’ job to approve 
the allocation of funds in a way that 
will best serve the students and the 
state of Florida, Orlando said. The 
board meets once a semester to 
discuss how best to do this. These 
meetings are normally held on cam-
pus and are always open to the pub-
lic. 
Board members also make up 
seven smaller committees, each 
with its own focus. Examples of 
these include the Audit and Com-
pliance Committee, the Facilities 
and Capital Investments Committee 
and the Advancement Committee. 
Public meetings for these also take 
place throughout the semester. 
“Everything that the board does 
directly or indirectly affects stu-
dents one way or another,” Orlando 
said. “Even if they don’t realize it.” 
One metric the board uses is 
UF’s rank among the nation’s pub-
lic research universities, Orlando 
said. UF was ranked No. 7 in the 
U.S. News & World Report rank-
ings of top public universities in 
2019, and the board is determined 
to reach No. 5. 
The student to teacher ratio is 
one factor of a school’s rank, Or-
lando said. In 2017, the board ap-
proved the Faculty 500 initiative to 
hire an additional 500 faculty mem-
bers for this reason. This lowered 
the student to teacher ratio from 
21:1 in 2015 to 18:1 currently. 
The national ranking isn’t the 
board’s only consideration, Orlando 
said. Members also approved the 
creation of a new position to over-
see the improvement of student life, 
a director of campus experience.
“Being ranked highly is nice,” 
Orlando said. “But at the end of the 
day, it’s really about providing the 
best educational experience for our 
students.”

“We walk in, not out of protest, 
but we walk in out of appreciation 
of those who came before us,” Var-
gas said. “We walk in to learn their 
stories, to recover their history and 
to value Latinx lives within the con-
text of the U.S.”After Vargas spoke, the class 
was led on a tour of La Casita by 
Hispanic-Latino Affairs ambassador 
Maria Dominguez, a 19-year-old UF 
linguistics sophomore, who is also 
in the class. 
La Casita’s original building 
opened in May 1994 after Hispanic 
and Latinx students petitioned for a space they could call theirs, ac-
cording to the Institute’s website. In 
2017, the structure was torn down 
alongside the UF Institute of Black 
Culture, and the extensive construc-
tion of both buildings cost $9.9 mil-
lion.
In 2017, UF’s Multicultural and 
Diversity Affairs department an-nounced plans to combine the two 
cultural institutes. Many students 
worried that by combining the 
houses the university would also 
be merging their cultures into one. 
This led students to protest and cre-
ate a Facebook page called “#No-
LaIBCita.” The protests delayed the 
opening of both buildings by about two years. 
“We’re using this space to learn 
more about Latin America,” Domin-
guez said. “This is exactly what this 
space is for: to learn, to interact 
with others. It’s perfect.”

The Gators gymnastics program 
has been among the best in NCAA 
history.
Only seven teams have ever 
won a national championship, and 
Florida is one of them, winning 
three consecutively from 2013-15.
Last season, though, it missed 
the NCAA Championships for only 
the second time in school history 
after falling to Denver and Oregon 
State in the regionals.
Now, after months of waiting, 
UF will try to finally put last sea-
son behind it, and that quest begins 
tonight.
The No. 3 Gators begin their 
2020 season at 6:45 p.m. against 
No. 19 Arkansas at the O’Connell 
Center. The match will be televised 
on SEC Network+.
Florida is returning most of the 
team that lost only two regular sea-
son matches last season and only 
one at home. That includes six 
All-Americans: sophomores Trinity 
Thomas and Savannah Schoenherr, 
junior Alyssa Baumann and Megan 
Skaggs and seniors Rachel Gowey 
and Amelia Hundley. Thomas and Schoenherr also earned All-Ameri-
can honors at the 2019 NCAA Indi-
vidual Championships.
One of the toughest tasks for the 
squad this season will be replacing 
Alicia Boren, who graduated after 
last season. Her senior campaign 
was one of the best in school his-
tory, capped off by winning a share 
of the floor title at the Individual 
Championships last season.
Despite losing Boren, UF only 
brought in one freshman in the 
offseason. It’s just the third time 
in program history the program 
brought in only one recruit. How-
ever, that freshman-- Payton Rich-
ards-- has already earned the praise 
of coach Jenny Rowland, who is 
entering her fifth season coaching 
the team.
“She is an old soul and a very 
happy soul and has already fit in 
well with this team,” Rowland 
said. “You will probably see Pay-
ton in multiple events in this first 
meet and throughout the season.”
Two things working in Florida’s 
favor this season are experience 
and, most importantly, depth.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
GYMNASTICSBy Bryan Matamoros
Sports Writer
Freshman guard Nina Rickards 
has struggled to find the bottom 
of the net since coach Cam 
Newbauer inserted her into the 
starting lineup in mid-December.
She managed just 12 points 
combined in her six starts on 
5-of-29 shooting from the field 
heading into Thursday night’s 
game against Auburn.
But Rickards nearly tripled 
her scoring average against the 
Tigers, as the freshman dropped 
13 points to help the Gators come 
away with an 83-63 victory over 
Auburn in Alabama.
After a scoreless performance 
from Rickards against Vanderbilt 
over the weekend, UF made it a 
priority to get her the ball early and often.
The Queens, New York, native 
was averaging just 4.4 points 
per game this season before 
Florida’s bout against AU, yet she 
surpassed that total in the opening 
minutes of the contest. Rickards 
scored the Gators’ first five points 
of the night and finished the first 
quarter with eight points on 3-of-4 
shooting from the floor, including 
a 2-of-3 effort from downtown.
Besides Rickards, UF (11-5, 2-1 
SEC) had four other players score 
in double figures.
Freshman guard Lavender 
Briggs paced the team with 19 
points, extending her streak of 
double-digit games to 14, the 
most by any UF player since the 
2001-02 season.
Her backcourt partner, redshirt 
junior guard Kiara Smith, chipped in with 15 points in 37 minutes 
of action.
Both Briggs and Smith 
have made things difficult for 
opponents this year, which was 
evident in Thursday night’s 
conference showdown. The two 
shot a combined 13 of 20 from the 
field, including a 4-of-8 showing 
from behind the arc against 
Auburn.
Sophomore guards Kristina 
Moore and Ariel Johnson sparked 
the offense as well with 12 and 10 
points, respectively.
The Tigers (6-8, 0-3 SEC) 
deployed a zone defense at the 
start of the game in an effort to 
fluster the Gators, but it backfired.

MEN’S BASKETBALL
MEN’S TENNISWOMEN’S TENNISBy Tyler Nettuno
Sports Writer
Last season, Florida’s 
men’s basketball team 
sleepwalked through the 
beginning of SEC play, 
starting 1-3.
But this time around, 
the Gators are 2-0 in the 
league and playing their 
best basketball of the 
season. UF is on a three-
game winning streak, 
averaging 95.7 points 
over that stretch (though 
one of those games went 
to double overtime).
After winning the 
first leg of a two-game 
road stretch 81-68 
against South Carolina 
on Tuesday night, the 
Gators travel to anoth-
er Columbia, this time 
west of the Mississippi, 
to take on the Missouri 
Tigers at 8:30 p.m. on 
Saturday.
Florida (10-4, 2-0 
SEC) is finally finding 
its footing on the offen-
sive side of the ball. The 
defense has been stout 
all year, allowing 65.5 
points per game. Now, it’s paired with a more 
effective scoring attack.
Point guard Andrew 
Nembhard is coming off 
back-to-back 20-point 
games, and he’s begin-
ning to demonstrate the 
offensive improvement 
coach Mike White hoped 
to see when Nembhard 
decided to return to 
Florida for his sopho-
more year. He’s averag-
ing more points (11.4) 
and assists (6.1) than he 
did last year.
Freshman guard Scot-
tie Lewis has also in-
creased his production, 
scoring 15 in his last 
two games since return-
ing from a concussion. 
He notched a double-
double against Alabama 
with 10 rebounds and 
nearly did it again in the 
South Carolina game, to-
taling nine.
But the Gators now 
run into a Missouri team 
that plays strong de-
fense, allowing just 57.7 
points per game. The Ti-
gers (8-6, 0-2 SEC) have 
had a disappointing start 
to SEC play, losing by 12 on the road to Kentucky 
and by 10 on their home 
floor to Tennessee.
Missouri’s resume 
also features a bad non-
conference loss against 
Charleston Southern.
Still, Mizzou has the 
personnel to give the 
Gators trouble, mainly 
in guards Dru Smith 
and Mark Smith (no re-
lation). Dru leads the 
team in scoring with 
11.3 points per game, 
and Mark is just behind, 
averaging 11.1. Both are 
shooting above 40 per-
cent from the field, but 
Mark is more dangerous 
on the outside having 
made 34 three-pointers 
this season.
Mark is also Mis-
souri’s rebounding lead-
er with 4.7 per game, 
and Drew averages 4.4.
Florida will have its 
hands full on the inte-
rior, as the Tigers have 
two 6-foot-10 players 
— Mitchell Smith and 
Reed Nikko — in their 
projected starting line-
up. However, neither 
average more than four rebounds.
UF center Kerry 
Blackshear Jr., on the 
other hand, has been a 
dominating force under 
the basket for Florida 
this season.
He’s averaging 14.6 
points and 8.7 rebounds 
and has seven double-
doubles through 14 
games. Containing him 
will be paramount for a 
Tigers team that gener-
ally wins the rebounding 
margin (they’re plus-4.1 
this year).
As SEC play pro-
gresses, Florida will try 
to show the NCAA Tour-
nament Committee that 
its four non-conference 
losses were the result 
of a brutal schedule. 
Road wins against teams 
like Missouri — which 
White has never lost to 
as Florida’s coach — 
would go a long way to 
bolster that argument.

The UF men’s tennis team comes 
into the 2020 season ranked No. 1 in 
the Oracle/ITA Rankings.
Florida’s top position was an-
nounced on Wednesday as it approach-
es its first match against Furman and 
FAU on Saturday. 
This is the first time Florida has 
been slotted this high since it opened 
the 2006 season at No. 2.
Florida’s 2018-19 season was a 
bookmark year in terms of success and 
improvement. The squad finished 25-4 
and won the SEC regular season title. 
It claimed the No. 4 spot in the final 2019 rankings.
This year’s No. 1 ranking is in large 
part to its dominant young athletes re-
turning to the court in 2020. 
Sophomore and team captain Sam 
Riffice will play a key role in Florida’s 
success this season. The 2019 SEC 
Freshman of the Year, ITA All-Ameri-
can (singles) and ITA Freshman of the 
Year provides UF with experience and 
leadership.
Senior Johannes Ingildsen and ju-
nior Duarte Vale will also provide lead-
ership for the Gators this season. 
That guidance will be needed in or-
der to groom two budding blue-chip 
freshmen for Florida.
Freshmen Blaise Bicknell (the No. 13 recruit in the country) and Will 
Grant (the No. 16 recruit in the coun-
try) add to Florida’s roster and both 
will get the chance to make an impact 
right away.
Florida opens its spring competition 
at the Alfred A. Ring Tennis Complex 
against Furman on Saturday at 10 a.m., 
followed by FAU at 3 p.m.

Florida’s women’s tennis team will take to the Carib-
bean to open its 2020 season.
UF is competing in the three-day Pink Flamingo Cup 
tournament in Nassau, Bahamas, from Friday through 
Sunday. The Gators’ weekend competition consists of No. 
4 UCLA, No. 7 Texas and No. 23 Miami. 
Because all participating teams are ranked, the tour-
nament will stand as a good test for Florida to start the 
spring.
The Cup will pit all four teams against each other in both singles and doubles events. 
On Friday, Florida will begin the tournament against 
Texas in doubles and UCLA in singles.
Saturday will bring a new challenge, as Florida will 
take on Miami in doubles and flip to singles against Texas.
Finally, on Sunday, the Gators will face UCLA in dou-
bles and Miami in singles.
Of the Gators’ eight spots on its roster, six players are 
returning from last season’s successful campaign. 
Florida earned a 32nd-straight NCAA Championship 
appearance last season and settled into the No. 24 slot in 
the final 2019 rankings.
Two athletes that will provide Florida with a big push 
this season are juniors McCartney Kessler and Ida Jarl-skog.
Kessler led UF in victories last year, accumulating 15 
match wins for the Gators on her way to a 2019 All-SEC 
Second Team selection, while 2019 All-American Jarlskog 
finished No. 17 in 2019 singles play.
Jarlskog also earned All-SEC First Team honors.
After UF wraps up its weekend overseas, it will return 
home until it has to hit the road to compete in the ITA 
Kick-off Weekend at NC State from Jan. 25-26.

on theROOFNEW!which prevented Auburn 
from settling into its 
halfcourt defense. This led 
to 11 fastbreak points for 
UF by the end of the ﬁ  rst 
half compared to AU’s zero.
“We did a good job of 
being aggressive in the 
ﬁ  rst half and shot it really 
really well,” Newbauer said 
in a release. “It was crazy, 
too, because we had ﬁ  ve 
offensive rebounds on only 
seven missed shots.”
Auburn wasn’t much 
better offensively.
It made just 24 of its 61 
ﬁ  eld goal attempts and went 7 of 29 from the three-point 
line against a suffocating 
Florida defense that has 
now held 11 of their 16 
opponents below their 
scoring average. Auburn 
averaged 70.6 points per 
game before Thursday 
night but was held to just 
63 by UF.
Guard Brooke Moore and 
forward Unique Thompson 
led the Tigers with 14 and 
10 points, respectively, in 
the loss.
With this victory, the 
Gators are now 2-1 in 
conference play for the ﬁ  rst time since the 2015-16 
campaign.
“We are just playing one 
possession at a time and 
not really thinking about 
anything other than trying 
to be the best version of 
ourselves,” Newbauer 
said. “We are just trying 
to compete and be the best 
team we can, day in and 
day out.”

bmatamoros@alligator.orgeveryone doing pretty much every event,” 
Gowey said. “That’s a huge beneﬁ  t to have 
so many people and so much depth at each 
event.”
The Gators’ opponent, the Razorbacks, 
are coming off a disappointing year. Last sea-
son, they ﬁ  nished eighth in the SEC with a 
1-7 dual record. Mark Cook, who had been 
the coach of the program since its founding 
in 2003, retired and was replaced by Jordyn 
Wieber. Wieber was a member of the gold 
medal-winning 2012 U.S. Olympic team and 
is the ﬁ  rst Olympic Champion to coach a col-
legiate program. 
This is the ﬁ  rst of nine straight meets 
for the Gators against teams ranked in the 
Women’s Collegiate Gymnastics Association 
(WCGA)’s top 25.
“There is no down time in gymnastics,” Rowland said. “You hit the ground running, 
and you are prepared, and you do what you 
can and it’s go time.”
Given the returning talent and the pre-
season rankings, expectations are sky high 
for the team this season.
“Everybody is super ﬁ  red up for the sea-
son, and we have been looking great in the 
gym,” Thomas said. “When we get out, you’ll 
see what we’ve been doing in the gym.”
The gymnasts expect the O’Connell Cen-
ter to be rocking again 2020. Last season, 
the O’Connell Center averaged 8,333 fans 
per meet last season, about 90 percent of the 
arena’s capacity for gymnastics.
“The O’Dome is really indescribable,” 
Gowey said. “I was trying to explain it to 
Payton (Richards) but you really just have to 
experience it yourself.”
