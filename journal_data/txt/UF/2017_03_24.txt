A UF international student from Pales-
tine was detained by Immigration and Cus-toms Enforcement over Spring Break, and he now awaits deportation.
Ali Jamoos was leaving a Carnival Cruise 
Line ship March 10, returning from Cozu-mel, Mexico, when security guards stopped the 24-year-old at PortMi-ami, said Victor Constan-tin, who was with Jamoos 
when he was detained.
Jamoos was taken to 
the port’s immigration of-
ﬁ  ce and then to the Krome Service Processing Center.
Four days later, the UF 
agriculture junior was transferred to the 
Broward Transitional Center in Pompano 
Beach, where he is awaiting deportation. 
Constantin, a UF alumnus who gradu-
ated in 2016 with a bachelor’s degree in business management, said his friend was detained after medically withdrawing from UF. 
Jamoos withdrew to brieﬂ  y return home 
and be with his mother and father, who has 
a kidney disease, and his 11 siblings.
“It was horrible to see him being taken 
away in handcuffs,” said Constantin, 23. 
“They didn’t talk to us, so it was very in-
timidating.”
Ahmed Hemeid, a UF biochemical en-
gineering graduate student, said after re-ceiving panicked phone calls from Jamoos’ 
friends the day he was detained, he imme-diately drove to Miami. 
Hemeid, 25, said he notiﬁ  ed UF’s Inter-
national Center about Jamoos’ detainment, 
and some staff members are contacting im-
migration ofﬁ  cers to inform them Jamoos is 
a UF student.
UF spokesperson Janine Sikes wrote in 
an email that UF is aware of Jamoos’ de-
tainment.
“(We) are monitoring the situation so 
that we may be helpful,” Sikes said. “His 
immigration legal issues are personal and we understand he has obtained an immigra-Palestinean UF student detained after Spring Break cruise

All Chris Chiozza could do was watch.
With seven seconds left in the game and the 
Commodores’ Matthew Fisher-Davis guarding him at the hip, Florida guard KeVaughn Allen launched a three-point shot from the right 
corner.
The ball clanked off the side of the rim.
With Allen’s last-second miss, the then-
struggling Commodores, who had a 9-10 re-cord and just three SEC wins at the time, com-pleted the upset — a 68-66 win over the No. 19 Florida Gators. Chiozza played 14 scoreless minutes, reduced to helplessly watching most of the game from the bench.
UF coach Mike White paused for a moment 
before he addressed reporters following the team’s ﬁ  rst home loss of the season.
“I don’t know what to do. We gotta ﬁ  gure 
it out,” said White, whose team endured a nar-row loss at South Carolina three days prior. 
“There’s a fork in the road here… . Do we 
panic? Do we point ﬁ  ngers? Do we blame each other? Or do we simply man up?”Just a day after arguably the worst loss of 
the season to that point, Florida’s backup point guard had a private meeting with White.
“I went into his ofﬁ  ce and apologized,” 
Chiozza said. “I told him I wasn’t focused as 
much as I should be on the right stuff and that 
I was sorry for not playing the way I was ca-pable of.”
In that meeting, White reassured the ju-
nior that he was an integral part of the team — someone the Gators couldn’t afford to do without. 
“He told me to just go out there and play hard and just do whatever I can to change the game,” Chiozza said. “The next game, I played as hard as I could.”
Three games later, a home contest against 
the Missouri Tigers, it all came together.
When UF forward Devin Robinson’s high-
arching three-pointer ripped through the net with 31 seconds left in the ﬁ  nal period, Chi-ozza forever became a part of Florida basket-ball history.
In the Gators’ 93-54 route of the Tigers, Chi-
ozza recorded 12 points, 12 rebounds and 10

Student Government announced 
Thursday that UF students can buy cheaper tickets to Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando indeﬁ  nitely. 
Students, faculty and staff with a 
valid Gator 1 Card can buy Disney World tickets from 11 percent to 15 percent off, depending on the ticket package and day, said Action SG chairman Ty Robare. Anyone can buy up to six tickets every 90-day pe-riod, and multi-day tickets are valid for two weeks after ﬁ  rst using one. 
“We thought it was pretty univer-
sally applicable for students, faculty and staff,” Robare said. 
Robare said he and Emily Daw-
son, the Action SG director of op-erations for on-campus projects, worked with Disney College Days after learning the University of South Florida offered the discount to its students. Previously, the discount 
was only available to students from 
the University of Central Florida. 
The discount comes at no cost to 
UF, Robare said. Disney and UF In-formation Technology created an on-line portal for students, faculty and 
staff to purchase tickets with their 
Gator 1 Card. 
One-day and multiple-day pack-
ages are available at starter, hopper and premium levels, according to Disney’s website. Blackout dates, when some pass holders cannot en-ter the park, only apply to one-day tickets. 
Savannah Oglesby, 19, said when 
she learned about the discounted tickets, she immediately began plan-ning a trip with her Delta Delta Delta Sorority sisters.
“I think it’s an amazing thing that 
they did this,” the UF business man-agement sophomore said. “When-ever you’re at Disney, it’s like you’re 
transporting back in time.”SG partners with Disney

WHAT’S HAPPENING?
‘Pity for the Wild: Three 
Grotesques’ by Tennessee 
WilliamsThe UF School of Theatre and Dance presents a “grotesque 
version” of Tennessee Williams’ 
“Pity for the Wild: Three Grotesques” until Sunday. This production features three works by the playwright, who is often considered one of America’s fin-est. The works, “The Chalky White Substance,” “Something Unspoken” and “The Gnädiges 
Fräulein,” reintroduce audiences 
to Williams as a playwright of the grotesque, where unforgettable characters struggle for equilib-rium in worlds interdependent of horror and laughter. These plays are quite unlike the Williams most people are accustomed to. Directed by Tiza Garland and 
Ralf Remshardt, tickets for the 
production are $18 for the general public, $15 for seniors, UF faculty and staff and $13 for UF students. Tickets are available through the University Box Office. More infor-mation is available at arts.ufl.edu.
University Galleries presents: 
‘Currents 2017’University Galleries and student 
organization H.O.T. Clay at UF are 
pleased to present “Currents 2017 Perception: Color and Content” in the Gary R. Libby Gallery from now until April 19. “Currents” is an annual national juried exhibi-tion co-juried by Linda Lopez and Katie Parker. “Perception: Color and Content” is thematically fo-
cused on the idea of how percep-
tion of color can change the way content is perceived. This impor-tant annual exhibition selects ju-rors and addresses contemporary themes in ceramic art. “Currents 2017” will expand the education-al experience for students within UF’s School of Art + Art History 
and engage the public with color 
and content within contemporary ceramic art. The exhibition and opening reception are free and open to the public.

WHOSE LINE IS IT ANYWAY?
A half an hour before tickets went on sale for the Reitz Union Board Entertainment Big Orange

The last time Lauren Carpen-
ter left Gainesville to go home to Tampa, she sat in trafﬁ  c.   
She isn’t the only one who 
has run into trafﬁ  c on Interstate 75 through Alachua and Marion counties.To help alleviate heavy trafﬁ  c 
along I-75, the Florida Department of Transportation is constructing 
a master plan to be released in 
fall, said Andrew Young, the state 
interchange review coordinator 
for FDOT.
“This will allow us to more ac-
tively manage I-75,” he said.
In 2010, a study rated I-75 through Alachua and Marion counties, a C in rural areas and a D in urban areas for level of ser-
vice by FDOT.
Expanding the highway to four 
lanes in each direction and imple-
menting tolled express lanes are two of the long-term solutions 
that have been proposed, Young 
said.In the short-term, FDOT will 
consider increasing road ranger presence, dynamic signs to alert 
drivers of congestion and signal 
coordination at cross streets to 
manage the ﬂ  ow of trafﬁ  c, he said. 
Ruth Steiner, a UF professor 
with the Department of Urban and 
Regional Planning, said she hopes 
FDOT will listen to the residents of Alachua and Marion counties and look into short-term, less ex-pensive solutions. 
“Instead of a very expensive 
highway project, there are little 
things to do,” she said.
One solution proposed is to 
lower the speed limit in certain 
sections or during certain times of 
the day, she said.FDOT plans to revamp I-75 along Alachua, Marion counties

Transparency is the theme for 
UF’s fourth annual TEDxUF confer-
ence.
Tickets are available for pick up 
tomorrow until March 31 for the 
conference, which is April 1 at 1:30 
p.m. There are 150 free tickets avail-able for students as well as anyone in the community. 
The conference will feature nine 
speakers who will talk for about 10 minutes on topics ranging from science to self-interest, said Kyley Hagan, the public relations coordi-
nator for the event.
“We picked (the theme) because 
we’re all trying to see transparency 
and understanding the pieces of our lives,” she said. “Transparency is of-ten prized above all else as a virtue.”
One of the speakers, LB Han-
nahs, will talk about LGBTQ+ rights, Hagan said.
“They are talking about ﬁ  nding 
the authenticity in discomfort,” the 21-year-old UF journalism junior said. “Students our age should ad-dress trans people and they will feel more comfortable.”
Candice Luc, a 20-year-old UF 
civil engineering junior, said she enjoyed the identity-themed confer-ence last year and related to it be-cause of her Asian American iden-tity.
“I think transparency could be 
interpreted in different ways,” she said “It could be in terms of politics or social issues.”Tickets now available

A company that tests internet 
speed found that of the 16 univer-
sities left in the NCAA men’s bas-ketball tournament, UF has the second-slowest internet speed.
But the UF information tech-
nology department disputes the company’s claim. Speedtest by Ookla, a glob-
al internet speed test company based out of Seattle, found UF to 
have an average download speed 
of 83.61 megabits per second and an upload speed of 88.29 Mbps, said Adriane Holter, a spokesper-son for the company. 
This puts UF second to last, 
third to last including Xavier Uni-versity, which had no data.Holter said the company con-
ducted the test by analyzing data from people who used Speedtest, 
a website that tests someone’s in-
ternet speed, in the area near the university campuses.
“It kind of sheds a spotlight 
on that performance, and it can incentivize investment in infra-structure,” Holter said.
Tracy Gale, the communica-tions manager for UFIT, wrote in an email that the director of network services found results 10 
times faster than Speedtest by Oo-
kla. UFIT found an 891.32 Mbps download speed and an 880.97 Mbps upload speed over a Wi-Fi connection.
“Ookla is a vendor and may 
have a vested interest in these rankings, in terms of who their university clients are,” Gale said.
Michelle Suarez, a UF political 
science freshman, said she uses 
UF’s Wi-Fi daily from her room in 
Beaty Towers.
“It’s not the best, but it gets 
the job done,” said the 18-year-old.

Authorities are investigating a suspected 
drive-by shooting that left one hospitalized 
Wednesday night, according to Gainesville Police.
Police arrived at Phoenix Villas Apart-
ments, 2550 SW 31st Place, after there were reports of shots ﬁ  red at 10:20 p.m. GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias wrote in an email that they found a man in his 30s with a gunshot wound to the neck. 
The man was sitting in a living room when 
a bullet went through the front window and 
hit him, Tobias said.
The apartment next door also had a bullet 
hole in its front door and window sill, Tobias 
said. Ofﬁ  cers found the apartment’s resident asleep and uninjured.
The man who was shot was taken to a 
hospital, Tobias said, adding that he was con-
scious and alert as of press time.
A surveillance video from a laundromat 
across the street, obtained by police, shows a silver car driving by the apartment, turning off its headlights as it passes the apartment. The car ran a stop sign and turned at the end of the street.
Police are still investigating the shooting 
and trying to determine if the shooting victim had a disagreement with anyone, Tobias said. 
A small fragment from the bullet was found 
lodged in his neck, and more pieces were found at the scene. No shell casings were re-covered from the apartment.
GPD has not released the name of the vic-
tim to keep him safe until the shooter is found.GPD: One man injured after

UF’s vice president and general counsel 
has taken leave from work so an ongoing 
investigation can continue without the ap-perance of a conﬂ  ict.
Jamie Lewis Keith chose Wednesday to 
temporarily step away from her position, UF spokesperson Janine Sikes wrote in an email. 
The decision was made after an on-
going internal investigation, regarding a complaint made by Gainesville-area law-yer Huntley Johnson, began Feb. 28. 
The Ofﬁ  ce of Internal Audit received a 
letter from Johnson with allegations about 
Keith, and the chief auditor began an in-
vestigation shortly after. 
“UF and Ms. Keith agreed Wednesday she would take time off 
from work during the in-vestigation to avoid even the appearance of a con-ﬂ  ict,” Sikes said.
At a UF Board of 
Trustees meeting March 
16, Johnson spoke about 
Keith and his planned lawsuit against UF. He 
accused Keith of not being ﬁ  t to run the Ofﬁ  ce of the General Counsel, which pro-vides legal representation for UF, and said clients do not respect the ofﬁ  ce because of her.
Keith was hired to the position in 2006 
and her salary has been $389,500 a year since 2015, according to UF documents. 
Sikes said she could not comment about 
the investigation because it is ongoing.UF’s top attorney takes leave

Anna Martin looked up as two 
students wrapped a royal-blue fab-
ric around her head.  
When it twisted neatly into five 
layers, she touched the turban and smiled at the two students from the Sikh Student Association who helped wrap her head.“It’s surprisingly comfy,” the 
20-year-old UF psychology senior said. “It feels like wearing a pillow 
on your head.”
The Sikh Student Association 
hosted its annual turban day on 
Turlington Plaza on Thursday. 
About 30 students allowed 
members to wrap turbans on their heads and answer questions about 
their faith, Sikhism.Jasmeet Kalsi, the organiza-
tion’s co-president, said the goal 
was to bring awareness of the Sikh 
religion and eliminate stereotypes 
through educating students.
“Our physical appearance is dif-
ferent, but that doesn’t make us foreign or terrorists,” the 22-year-
old UF biology senior said.
Martin said she heard about the 
event from her intercultural com-munication’s professor.
“I think it’s cool they took time 
to tell other people about their cul-ture,” she said.
Kalsi said the event has not re-
ceived negative reactions in the 
past and hopes to continue educat-ing students about her religion.
“That ignorance is where hate 
and fear stem from,” she said. “As 
long as we educate people, I like to think we won’t have problems.” 
Neal Singh, a member and for-
mer president, said he has par-
ticipated in turban day since 2009. 
Singh said his favorite aspect of the 
event is that students of every cul-
ture are willing to experience his.
“Despite what people feel about 
different faiths, it’s amazing people are willing to come out and experi-
ence something different,” he said. UF students wear turbans to connect with Sikhism

HE STOLE $7,670 WORTH 
OF ITEMS.
By Meryl Kornfield
Alligator Staff Writer
Gainesville Police arrested a 
man Wednesday morning in con-
nection with three burglaries at an apartment complex known for its student population.
Gainesville resident Ken-
trell Levon Hodges Sr., 28, stole $7,670 worth of items from three apartments in Oxford Manor, 
at 2777 SW Ar-cher Road, be-tween Decem-
ber 2016 and 
February 2017, 
according to an arrest report. In all the burglaries, Hodges came into the apartments through back entrances.
In the burglaries, Hodges took electronics, jewelry, accessories and a suitcase, police said. In one case, he broke into an apartment while the owner was asleep, ac-cording to the report.
One victim of a burglary no-
ticed someone had accessed her 
Netflix account from her stolen TV 
and changed the profile names to “Ty & Trell” and “Khai,” accord-ing to the report. The IP address the TV was used at matched the apartment of Hodges’ girlfriend.
Police searched Hodges’ apart-ment and found stolen items from the burglaries, according to the report. Marijuana, hydrocodone pills and MDMA tablets, which are commonly called Molly or Ec-stasy, were found in a jacket that was in the living room.
Hodges pawned off a stolen 
ring for $20 in January, according to the report.
After his arrest, Hodges told 
police he sells marijuana and that the other drugs were his, according to the report. He said he bought the stolen items from someone for $150 and he didn’t steal from the apartments.
Police arrested Hodges on 
charges of grand theft, dealing in stolen property, false information on a pawn transaction form, bur-
glary and violation of probation. 
Authorities took him to the Alach-ua County Jail, where he remains, as of press time, without bond.

tion lawyer to assist him.”
Jamoos’ friends found a law-
yer who agreed to help for an 
estimated $3,800. They created a GoFundMe account Thursday to raise $4,100, which also covers the webpage service fees, Hemeid said. As of press time, they’ve raised $6,340 within 11 hours.
“The power of his friends and 
his network is phenomenal,” He-meid said. “I didn’t expect the pro-cess to be this rapid.”
Constantin said Jamoos has 
two options: being deported in-voluntarily, which would ban him from entering the U.S. for five years, or being voluntarily deport-ed. Since Jamoos is graduating in two semesters, his friends are try-ing for the second option.
In Fall 2014, Jamoos was de-
tained at a Boston airport after 
returning home from a semester-
long medical leave to visit his sick father, Constantin said. 
Angie Aguirre, a UF sociology 
alumna, said she visited Jamoos 
at the detention center Saturday. 
When she saw him in an orange jumpsuit, Aguirre broke down. 
But Jamoos kept smiling. “He doesn’t deserve this, but 
he’s being positive so that’s help-ing us feel positive as well,” the 23-year-old said.

Undocumented immigrants and elected 
officials gathered at a local church to discuss 
threatening immigration policies and how to deal with them Thursday night.
In a meeting that frequently switched be-
tween English and Spanish at Westminster Presbyterian Church, located at 1521 NW 34th St., about 40 undocumented immigrants listened to guidelines set forth by the Ameri-can Civil Liberties Union on how to defend themselves against President Donald Trump’s mass-deportation agenda.
The event was led by local grassroots 
group Madres Sin Fronteras, which translates 
to Mothers Without Borders. The group, led in part by UF alumnus Beto Soto, was created 
to preserve the human rights of all Gainesville citizens, regardless of immigration status.
Alachua County Sheriff Sadie Darnell, 
Gainesville Mayor Lauren Poe and other com-munity leaders attended the meeting, which lasted about two hours.
Everyone at the event, about 100 in total, 
clapped when Darnell arrived. Alachua Coun-ty was the only Florida county listed for failing to comply with Immigration and Customs En-forcement policy in a report published by the Department of Homeland Security, according to Alligator archives.
“My role, my responsibility, and that of 
all those who work with me, is about hu-
man rights,” Darnell told the crowd. “We care 
about people who are victimized.”Darnell, who distributed her business card 
to the meeting’s attendees, said ACSO adheres to most of ACLU’s guidelines. She added that if anyone is being treated poorly by an Ala-chua County Sheriff’s officer, they should per-sonally let her know.
Undocumented immigrants stood in front 
of the crowd to deliver tear-filled testimoni-als about why they left their countries, and how frightening it is to live in fear of being deported.
One speaker, an immigrant who has lived 
illegally in the U.S. for more than three years, left Honduras to escape her husband’s abuse. 
A translator explained that the woman, 
whose first name is Leslie, is afraid her hus-
band — a  professional hitman — would kill 
her and her son if she were to be sent back. “Trump’s campaign and voice does not 
represent us. We are not killers, we are not criminals, we are not rapists,” Leslie said. “We are here to work and give a better future to our families.”
Poe, who said this kind of meeting will be 
the first of many, thanked those who were 
courageous enough to share painful stories.
“In Gainesville, whoever you are, wher-
ever you came from and however long you’ve 
been here, you’re welcomed and we’re glad that you’re here,” he said. “I’m here tonight as one of your leaders to make sure every single person in the city feels welcomed and a part of the community.”

ColumnLast Friday, conservative superstar Tomi Lahren revealed 
on “The View” that, contrary to most of her viewers, she is 
pro-abortion rights. Lahren said she believes in limited gov-ernment, and that it would be hypocritical of her to believe that the government can intervene with her body. Now, we’re not here to absolve Lahren of everything else she’s said — she’s not getting a laurel. What we’re doing is giving a dart to her network, The Blaze, which suspended her. The Blaze prides itself on being a free-speech zone (no cushy liberal safe spaces here!). But apparently, one of its most popular faces can’t express her own opinions. Just a bit hypocritical, wouldn’t you say? Their definition of free speech, it seems, only applies when that speech agrees with them.
Tonight at the Reitz Union, Young Thug and Demetri Mar-
tin are set to perform for Reitz Union Board Entertainment’s fourth annual Big Orange Festival. Although the announce-ment only came out a few days ago, advance tickets for Young Thug have already been completely handed out. Don’t worry though, dedicated fans can still snatch tickets for Demetri Mar-tin or wait in the standby lines. Young Thug’s performance will also be shown on a screen in the Grand Ballroom for those who don’t make the standby line. We’re giving a laurel to RUB Entertainment, despite a short amount of time since the announcement. Clearly they picked hot acts, as the line for advanced ticketing circled around the North Lawn. 
Ivanka Trump now has her own office in the White House, 
as well as government-issued communication devices. She also has no official title; she’s just going to be a generic adviser to her father on some issues, which may or may not change. It’s all very vague and very unconventional. She won’t be tak-ing a government salary, but she will be using government resources and information, so she still needs to be held up to the same ethical standards as other employees (so we hope, at least). Nothing like this has ever been done before, but then again, there has not really been anything conventional and typical about this administration — what with the First Lady remaining in New York City, and you know, a whole investi-gation on whether Trump associates colluded with the Krem-lin to sway the election in Donald Trump’s favor. Regardless, we’re throwing a dart to this move — if only all our rich daddies could give us coveted office space. 
And lastly, we lost a great musician earlier this week. At 90, 
Chuck Berry passed away in his home due to natural causes. Berry was one of the pioneers of rock ‘n’ roll, helping shape the old roots of rhythm and blues into the quintessential ele-ments of 50s rock ‘n’ roll that we all know so well, among them guitar solos and spectacular showmanship. It’s hard to find a musician who was not directly or indirectly influenced by Berry. He lived a long life, touring until a few years ago. His last studio album is set to be released this summer. He was — is — a legend, making music until the very end.

season is no exception. If you’re one of the lucky few who suffer from seasonal allergies, you are probably familiar with this time of year. If you’re a freshman who did not realize just how potent the pollen levels in Gainesville get, well, you live, you learn, you buy 10 packs of tissues at a time from P.O.D. Market. But hang in there allergy sufferers — only a few more weeks until the air is full of moisture and heat instead of pollen! Meanwhile, tune in to this week’s recap of non-pollen related news with…
Darts & Laurels
Ninety-three thousand fans thunder; ESPN cam-
eras litter the sidelines, broadcasting the game to millions more; white, blue and orange Tebow jerseys, Polos and Gator football shirts pepper the crowd like a UF seasoning. 
You’d think that such a momentous event, re-
peated more than eight times a year in Gainesville alone, would rake in dollars for the university like fall leaves, but that is not the case. To cover the costs of stadium maintenance, athletic scholar-ships and facility improvements alone, UF is left with only a small excess of revenue compared to the university’s total expenditures — revenue that can’t even be spent at the university’s discretion because the 
athletic department has its own board.
Where, then, does UF get its money if not from sports? 
State funding? Tuition? A secret money tree forest deep in-
side Paynes Prairie? 
In fact, none of these pulls the majority of the financial 
weight. Instead, donations — stored in a 501(c)(3) nonprofit foundation endowment — constitute a huge majority of the university’s figurative wallet. And although that money, too, has restrictions — a spokesperson for the foundation told me 
donors restrict 99 percent of all donated money — it is all 
either invested or spent on improvements felt directly by stu-dents. So how does UF’s endowment stack up among other public universities? Poorly, depending how you look at it. We rank 17th among public universities in endowment size, but only three of the 16 schools above us have larger student populations. This means our endowment per student is sig-nificantly smaller than nearly all of those schools. 
For a university competing to be the best in its class, that 
position is mediocre. 
It means that, compared to other top public and private 
universities, UF students get less access to the latest tech-nologies, delayed departmental developments and less mon-ey toward research, the wellspring of future donations. For perspective, UF ranks 23rd among colleges in research and development spending, far behind several top public univer-sities like the University of Michigan, which ranks second while maintaining highly competitive athletic pro-grams to boot.
This problem, if we can call it that, may lie 
in our university’s brand. We are known primar-ily and sometimes exclusively as a top spot for 
football and basketball — an SEC school and little 
else. While our ever-shrinking acceptance rate is well-documented among college hopefulls, our prominence in research resides somewhere in the shadows, due in large part because of how much attention our athletic achievements garner. As a result, our academic accomplishments are not touted nearly as often or as loudly as they should 
be.
To be clear, I’m not suggesting we spend less on sports 
and abandon athletic competitiveness in favor of some Har-vard equivalent moonshot. Ohio State and Michigan both outrank us in research spending and endowment size by de-cent margins — $10 billion versus $1.5 billion in endowments compared to Michigan — while faring better on the football field in recent years. If we want to exceed these universities and others academically — and we should — we need better academic engagement with donors. Large donations of $100 
million or more, referred to as “transformational,” don’t roll 
in for sports, but for areas like cancer research, and donors need to be as aware of the progress we pioneer in academia as they are of the progress we pioneer on the field.
To UF President Kent Fuchs’ credit, this has been his stat-
ed goal since taking office. But we’ve seen little gains in the first year of his tenure — no “transformational” donations and a vacant position for director of Donor Programs.
We often hear that action bends to the will of the dol-
lar, but our university spends too little time harping on that which would yield it the biggest returns. Next to tournament victories and national championships, we should be shout-ing about our breakthroughs in archaeology and physics — on Facebook, Twitter and especially in the ears of donors with deep pockets.

Column
College is great. Where else can indi-
viduals pursue knowledge and inter-ests while inhabiting society’s most intellectual environments? How lucky are we as a country to have so many 
options for higher education, as well as op-portunities to make it happen? Many could argue the university is one of society’s great-est achievements, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it is for everyone.
If you were to chart out humanity’s ad-
vancement on a graph, it would be a trend of exponential growth. One hundred years ago, people were riding horses into town for ra-tions, and now drones can deliver our food to us. Last year, I had pneumonia for three gruel-ing months, an illness that would’ve meant im-pending doom even 70 years ago, yet here I am writing this column today. If we were to zoom in on this trendline, we would see numerous ﬂ  uctuations up and down, (sometimes us hu-mans are dumb and make terrible mistakes, however, sometimes we learn from them), but the overall trend is positive. 
At the base of this line would be the earli-est humans, hunting and gathering on a hostile planet, trying to sur-vive. Those people didn’t have time to sit under trees and contemplate the morality of man, or how many miles away that blinding thing in the sky is from them. One does not have time to ponder life’s deepest intricacies when fending off saber-toothed tigers. Free time is a recent invention, created by man when he realized most things were (relatively) un-der his control. It was with this extra time not spent worrying about survival that man began to think deeper and take notice of all going on around him. But while “thinkers” like Socrates and Plato were lounging in the Agora, pluck-ing grapes off vines and discussing morality, most of the men in Athens were still ﬁ  ghting wars, building structures and working their trade. History likes to look fondly on thinkers, the great minds behind our achievements, but such achievements were not possible without people physically making things. You know, with their hands.Pursuing knowledge and study-
ing the world is wonderful, but none of it means anything if society and cities are physically falling apart. Somebody built that building those philosophers and historians are de-bating in, and those pipes aren’t go-ing to ﬁ  x themselves should some-thing go terribly wrong.
Our culture tends to either look 
down upon, or simply neglect, trade 
schools. It’s great that our politicians are urg-ing every single high-school student to go to college, but the reality is that college is not the best option for everyone. For some, it is wiser ﬁ  nancially to learn a trade and hop into the workforce immediately, no lollygagging or major-changing involved. For others, they simply aren’t interested in studying ancient Mesopotamian pottery or theoretical formulas, but would rather make useful items with their own hands. 
We need to stop acting like college is the 
only road to success in life. Sure, it is a prov-en way to increase your employability, but it should not be considered the cure-all for any-body trying to make it in the world. Experts are already anticipating a dire need for trade workers in the near future, as more and more millennials opt for “ﬁ  nding their passion” at a university instead of considering all of the (often more practical) options available. To satisfy this need, we are going to need fewer people studying lofty abstractions and more learning how to ﬁ  x that leaking pipe upstairs, training to become tomorrow’s electricians and plumbers. The demand for these services grows in parallel with society’s growth. Plus, such businesses can be surprisingly lucrative and rewarding. 
College is wonderful, but it is not the key 
to happiness or the single golden ticket toward a life of professional success. Going to college deﬁ  nitely can help one achieve one’s dreams or discover new ﬁ  elds to enter, but to treat it as somehow superior or above working a trade is not only wrong, but it could also prove detri-mental for ensuing generations.

As the great Hannah Montana once 
said, “Nobody’s perfect.” This lyri-cal statement rings true to college students across the nation. We use it as a justiﬁ  cation for everything from 
sleeping through our early morning lecture classes to drinking a little too much at the bars. We all screw up sometimes because re-ally, nobody is perfect.
Unfortunately, this makeshift excuse can-
not account for the mistakes and blunders of every person in the world. Some people are exempt from this attitudinal loophole because they are held to a higher standard 
than the rest of us. This concept of height-
ened expectations has run through my mind over the past two weeks, resulting from the bewildering headlines featuring my beloved university.
By now, we are all familiar with the story: 
Smith Meyers, the man we trusted to repre-sent our school, was arrested in Key West after drunkenly knocking over two motor-
cycles. The ofﬁ  cer who arrested him even said Myers was so drunk he didn’t 
know he was in Key West. His gaffe made news headlines for days, most recently news of the bike owners and Meyer’s arrangement, bringing 
shame to the university and the stu-
dents who call it home.
I am conﬁ  dent the rest of the Stu-
dent Body wasn’t perfectly behaved on their vacations. I’m sure there were multiple cases of drunken ar-rests and intoxicated mishaps among UF’s Spring-Breakers. However, when an ordinary student messes up, it doesn’t make the news. 
It doesn’t go down in historical archives as 
a blemish on the record of the university. There is a stark difference between the rest of the Student Body and Meyers. 
His position of power makes him a role 
model for nearly 52,000 students and his presidential position makes him the face of our school. When Meyers chose to run for Student Body president, he did so knowing 
that he would, and should, be held to a high-er standard than other students.
This distinction between con-
stituents and leaders is some-
thing that plays out in all realms of life. With power comes added 
responsibilities, but it is the price 
that one knowingly pays when they pursue these types of posi-tions. 
A CEO knows that a faux pas 
on their part means bad public-
ity for the company. A club leader knows skipping meetings sets a bad example for members. A politician knows an extramarital 
affair will end up in the press and cause up-
set among supporters. Leaders in all profes-sional and social arenas are well aware of the added responsibilities that come with their roles. Why should we cut Meyers slack for being ignorant of this reality?
I don’t mean to speciﬁ  cally focus on the 
Spring Break snafu of Meyers. I rather want to use his poor judgement as call to action 
for the rest of our campus leaders. Every-one has choices to make and obligations to 
prioritize. In the case of Meyers, he made it clear to his constituents that he prioritizes irresponsible fun over his duties as Student Body president-elect.
Some may contend that this standard isn’t 
fair; that Meyers deserves to make drunken mistakes in college just like everyone else. Unfortunately, the second Meyers decided to run for Student Body president, he know-ingly threw himself into the public eye and abandoned all allowance for intoxicated screw ups. 
When we allow our leaders to set bad 
examples through their own shortcomings, we not only give them the power to poorly represent the community they lead, but we allow the rest of the world to follow suit. Whether you are on a college campus or in the real world, character counts. It always has and it always will.

 AP ROUNDUP: TOP STORIES FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY
Utah man killed in London attack 
was celebrating wedding anniversary
The Associated Press
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A Utah couple 
was enjoying the ﬁ  nal day of their European 
trip to celebrate their 25th wedding anniver-sary when they were among the crowd of people on London’s Westminster Bridge who 
were struck by an SUV.
Kurt W. Cochran was one of two people 
killed, and his wife, Melissa Cochran, was 
among dozens who were injured, according to a statement issued Thursday by the family through a Mormon church spokesman. The couple was visiting Melissa Cochran’s par-ents, who were serving a church mission in London.
Authorities on Thursday identiﬁ  ed a 
52-year-old British man as the person who mowed down the Cochrans and other pedes-trians and stabbed a policeman to death out-side Parliament, saying he had a long criminal record and once was investigated for extrem-ism — but was not currently on a terrorism watch list.
Pictures on Kurt Cochran’s Facebook page 
show the couple enjoying their sightseeing trav-els through Europe prior to the tragic events. In one post, there are pictures of German archi-tecture beneath a caption, “Trier Germany. An-
other WOW!” In another, he is shown smiling 
and holding a German beer under the caption, “After a long day of sightseeing.”
Family and friends said they’re heartbro-
ken over the loss of a loving husband and fa-ther who loved music.
Police: Random racist violence ends 
in death of black man in New York
The Associated Press
NEW YORK (AP) — One was a neighborly 
black man who lived in a rooming house in 
New York’s Garment District, liked to col-lect autographs outside Broadway’s theaters, struck up a Twitter friendship with a Holly-
wood actress and took photos of himself with 
Oprah Winfrey and Beyonce.
The other was a white U.S. Army veteran 
from outside Baltimore who was raised in what was described as a church-going and lib-eral family and served in Afghanistan.
Late Monday night, ofﬁ  cials say, their 
paths crossed tragically on the streets of New York in a cold-bloodedly random act of racist 
violence by the white man.
As 66-year-old Timothy Caughman bent 
over a trash bin around the corner from his 
home, gathering bottles to recycle, James Har-ris Jackson attacked him from behind with a 2-foot sword and walked off, prosecutors say. A bleeding Caughman staggered into a police station and later died at a hospital.
On Thursday, Jackson, 28, was charged 
with murder as a hate crime. He said nothing in court.
“The defendant was motivated purely by 
hatred,” said Assistant District Attorney Joan 
Illuzzi, who added that the charges could be 
upgraded, “as this was an act most likely of terrorism.”
Prosecutors said Jackson hated black men, 
especially those who dated white women.
He came to New York last week to make 
a splash in the media capital of the world by killing as many black men as possible, author-ities said. He saw Caughman on the street and 
thought he would make good practice for a 
larger attack in Times Square, they said. But Caughman wound up the only victim.Vote for Obamacare repeal put 
off in stinging setback for Trump 
The Associated Press
WASHINGTON (AP) — After seven years 
of fervent promises to repeal and replace the 
Affordable Care Act, President Donald Trump and GOP congressional leaders buckled at a moment of truth Thursday, putting off a 
planned showdown vote in a stinging setback 
for the young administration.
The White House insisted the House vote 
would still happen — Friday morning instead — but with opposition ﬂ  owing from both strongly conservative and moderate-leaning GOP lawmakers, that was far from assured.
The delay was announced after Trump, 
who ran for president as a master deal-maker, 
failed to close the deal with a group of fellow 
Republicans in the ﬁ  rst major legislative test of his presidency.
Still, leaders of the conservative Freedom 
Caucus said they were continuing to work with the White House late Thursday on their demands to limit the requirements on insur-ance companies now in place under former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act.
“I can tell you at this point we are trying to 
get another 30 to 40 votes that are now in the ‘no’ category to ‘yes.’ Once we do that I think we can move forward,” said Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows of North Carolina.
The ﬁ  gures quoted by Meadows were star-
tling since Republicans can lose only 22 votes in the face of united Democratic opposition. A tally by The Associated Press counts at least 31 solid “no” votes.
Israel arrests hacker linked to recent 
bomb threats on US Jewish centers
The Associated Press
JERUSALEM (AP) — A 19-year-old Amer-
ican-Israeli Jewish man was arrested Thurs-
day as the prime suspect in a wave of bomb threats against U.S. Jewish community cen-ters, a startling turn in a case that had stoked 
fears of rising anti-Semitism in the U.S.
The surprising arrest of the man, a hacker 
who holds dual Israeli and American citizen-
ship, came after a trans-Atlantic investigation with the FBI and other international law en-forcement agencies. U.S. Jewish groups wel-comed the breakthrough in the case, which drew condemnation from President Donald Trump.
Israeli police described the suspect as a 
hacker, but said his motives were still un-clear.
“He’s the guy who was behind the JCC 
threats,” police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said, referring to the scores of anonymous threats phoned in to Jewish community cen-ters in the U.S. over the past two months.
Police banned publication of his name, but 
said he was a dual citizen and would remain in custody until at least March 30. During the arrest raid, they said he tried to grab an ofﬁ  -cer’s gun but was stopped by another ofﬁ  cer.
The young man appeared brieﬂ  y in court 
in the central Israeli city of Rishon Letzion. He wore khaki pants and a blue sweater that he used to cover his face as he walked past reporters. He made no comment.
His lawyer, Galit Bash, said her client had 
a “very serious medical condition” that might have affected his behavior. She said the con-dition had prevented him from attending el-
ementary school, high school or enlisting in 
the army, which is compulsory for most Jew-ish men.FRIDAY, MARCH 24, 2017   ALLIGATOR   9
THE WORKSHOP WILL TAKE 
PLACE APRIL 10.
By Klarizza Aggabao
Alligator Contributing Writer
Soo Ahn knows the importance of educat-
ing farmers market vendors about food safety.  
For the third year, the assistant professor 
at the UF food science and human nutrition 
department at IFAS will host an all-day edu-cational workshop for farmers market manag-ers and vendors April 10 in Ocala. “The goal of the workshop is (to) help 
farmers markets’ managers and vendors, both current and future, understand the regu-latory requirements, learn food safety prac-tices and provide them with information on how to economically improve the market,” Ahn said.
The workshop will be held from 9 a.m. to 
4 p.m. at 405 SE Osceola Ave. on the second-floor training room of the Power Plant Busi-ness Incubator. It is limited to the first 40 people due to capacity.
The cost for early registration, until March 31, is $40. Starting April 1, the price will be 
$50. Those interested in attending the event 
should register at the Eventbrite website. 
Another topic that the workshop will cov-
er is economic developments in the markets. Ahn said this particular class will focus on current trends associated with a new type of consumer.
“We discuss a lot of different payment op-
tions or different programs available for farm-ers markets,” Ahn said, adding that vendors now deal with more digital-based consumers.
Despite the different consumers, it is still important to teach the vendors about the reg-
ulations and safety in selling produce at the 
farmers markets, she said.
Cody Galligan, 37, of Siembra Farm, said 
he’s been farming for six years and has been organically farming for the last two years. He sells his produce at three different farm-ers markets, including Union Street Farmers Market and the county farmers market.
“If you’re selling food, you definitely carry 
a responsibility to be informed about the po-tential pathogens, bacteria and all that stuff,” Galligan said.

SOUNDS OF THE SYMPHONY

For the 48th year, the Santa Fe College 
Spring Arts Festival will display artwork from more than 200 artists.
The festival will be held April 1 and April 
2 and is free and open to the public. It will be located on Northeast First Street in down-town Gainesville, and the festival hours are Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and Sun-day from noon to 5 p.m.   
Raul Villarreal, Santa Fe’s acting coordi-
nator of cultural programs, said he is direct-ing this festival for the first time this year and has a group of artists and musicians coming in from all over the country. 
“Last year, one artist really stood out to us, so we chose him to be the poster artist for this year,” Villarreal said. 
Erh-Ping Tsai, a Taiwanese artist living in 
New York, is the poster artist for this year’s festival and will be at the event signing post-ers and selling his work, Villarreal said. 
“It’s a family-oriented event where peo-
ple get to meet up with their friends, walk around and look at artwork and listen to mu-sic,” Villarreal said.
Gabriella Garcia, a 20-year-old UF graphic 
design sophomore, said she is looking for-ward to the festival. 
“It’s always cool to go to art festivals 
because you see such innovative art pieces from artists from all over the world,” Garcia said. “I’m excited to see what they have to offer this year.”

When Florida hired Mike White 
as the men’s basketball coach to 
take over for UF legend Billy Don-
ovan, forward Devin Robinson 
had never heard White's name. 
“I didn’t know who he was,” 
Robinson said. 
Before Donovan left, he spoke 
with the forward, who was just a freshman at the time. 
“He told me he was going 
to put us in a position that we 
weren’t going to be disappointed 
(in) as a team,” Robinson said. “So I listened.”
Two years later, White and 
Robinson are leading the Gators on a postseason push. 
Robinson, UF’s third-best reg-ular-season scorer, is shouldering the Gators’ offense, averaging 19 points per game through the ﬁ  rst 
two rounds of the NCAA Tourna-
ment. 
But it’s not just offense. Robinson has admitted he 
“didn’t believe in playing de-fense” in his freshman and sophomore seasons. But now, the lengthy, athletic 6-foot-8 for-ward has broadened his abilities 
beyond just scoring and ﬁ  nishing 
acrobatic alley-oops. He’s upped his effort on defense and leads the Gators with nine rebounds 
per game through their ﬁ  rst two 
tournament matchups.
“He’s looked himself in the 
mirror and made some decisions,” White said. “He’s going to try to  Robinson leading 
Gators into Sweet 16
OK, who saw this coming?
Before the season started, I was 
under the impression that this Flor-
ida team would be good. Not great.
I didn’t expect the Gators to be 
one of the best offensive teams in the SEC.
I didn’t expect them to boast one of the 
best defenses in the nation.
And I certainly didn’t expect them to 
thrash No. 5 seed Virginia and advance to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament.
In fact, before the season began, I wouldn’t 
have been surprised if Florida missed the NCAA Tournament entirely.
After a mediocre 15-loss season in 2015-
16, I didn’t quite know what to expect once this season began. There were so many questions and so few an-swers.
Would point guard Kasey Hill 
be able to overcome his struggles and put up a stellar senior sea-son?
Would forward Devin Rob-
inson and center John Egbunu overcome the injuries they sus-tained last year and improve?
Would graduate transfer Canyon Barry, 
who has basketball greatness in his blood, be able to acclimate to SEC basketball after spending three years at the College of Charles-ton?And, most importantly, would 
Mike White take the “next step” in his second year as the Gators’ head coach?
For the most part, most of 
those questions have been an-swered, and the way they’ve been answered is a huge reason for the Gators’ success.
There’s not one reason for 
UF’s great play during the regular season and now here in March Madness. It has been a collective effort.
In the Round of 64 against No. 13 seed 
East Tennessee State, it was Hill, Robinson, Kevarrius Hayes and Chris Chiozza who stepped up. In the Round of 32, it was Robin-son, Justin Leon and the Gators’ most domi-nant defensive performance of the season that led them to a 26-point win over the Cavaliers.
“I’m really happy for our guys,” White 
said. “Really happy for our seniors. Really happy for Devin, the progress he’s made… . We’re happy to be here.”
Like I said, the Gators have by far sur-
passed any expectation I had for them prior to the start of the season. 
And maybe I was wrong for that.However, as one of my colleagues articu-
lated after the ETSU game, no matter what happens from here on out — win or lose — Florida’s season is already a success.
 Florida's men’s basketball team has greatly exceeded my expectationsHERE COMES THE BOONE / OPINION

Sports Writer
It certainly won’t carry the hype that 
surrounded their football teams, but make 
no mistake: The Florida-LSU rivalry on 
the baseball diamond is alive and well. 
Last season, the Tigers created a whole 
campaign based off an unusual critter: the 
rally possum. It began when a possum ran 
on the field during a game against Arkan-
sas, one the Tigers were losing 9-4 at the time. Somehow, LSU pulled off a remark-able comeback and thus a legendary mar-supial was born. 
LSU players and fans ran with the 
#RallyPossum craze.
That is, until it met its match: Florida’s 
rally owl. 
In last year’s SEC Tournament, UF 
players brought a stuffed owl into the dugout to oppose the possum. While 
the Gators ultimately lost that 14-inning 
affair, the owl regrouped and pounced a few days later as UF ousted LSU from the tournament in a 1-0 thriller. Though it’s unknown if either animal 
will make an appearance in Gainesville this weekend as the two teams converge, Florida players are eager to face the Tigers. 
“With the rally owl and rally opossum 
last year, it was really interesting in the SEC Tournament and the postseason and everything else,” sophomore Brady Singer said. “It’s really, really exciting.”
What is guaranteed is a showcase of 
great talent from both sides. 
Florida ace Alex Faedo will take the 
mound against Alex Lange tonight. The two right-handers played together for the U.S. Collegiate National Team and are good bets to be first-round picks in the upcoming MLB Draft.
And the Saturday matchup figures to 
be just as good. 
Singer and senior left-hander Jared 
Poche will square off. The two have com-pletely different styles — Singer being 
more of a hard-throwing, here-it-is-try-to-
hit-it type pitcher, while Poche is a crafty southpaw who doesn’t overpower but  UF baseball team looking to break out of slump against LSU SEE HOOPS,  PAGE 15

his career and the fourth in program history.
“Ever since then, I just got my 
conﬁ  dence back,” Chiozza said. “I 
feel like I should have been playing 
this way the whole year and even before this year.”
Since the Missouri game, he’s 
had eight double-ﬁ  gure scoring games — including a stretch of ﬁ  ve straight — and was crucial in Flori-da’s dominant wins over then-No. 8 Kentucky and South Carolina.
Chiozza credits his second-year 
head coach, the rest of the coaching staff and his teammates as reasons for his recent success.
“They just boosted me up, letting 
me know that I can play like that ev-ery game,” Chiozza said.
Now, after a ﬁ  rst-round win over 
East Tennessee State and a second-
round thrashing of No. 5 seed Vir-
ginia, Chiozza is in an unfamiliar position, a place the Gators haven’t been in nearly two years — the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament.
But he said that won’t stop him.No challenge ever has. 
“I knew then that he was 
something special”
Chiozza bolted toward the basket 
as fast as his little legs could carry 
him.
With surprising speed, the 2-year-
old toddled across the ﬂ  oor of the house. As he neared the hoop, he let out a mighty roar.
Ball in hand, the toddler charged 
on, sprang into the air and delivered a thunderous dunk on his Little 
Tikes basketball goal — a present 
he received from his parents that 
Christmas morning.
“I knew then that he was some-
thing special,” said LaCresha Cren-shaw, Chiozza’s older sister. “I was like, ‘This guy, he’s gonna really be something.’ It was just that special twinkle in him.”
In the Chiozza household, bas-
ketball was a family affair. Brother against sister. Husband against wife. Kid against parent.
Whenever they had free time, the 
Chiozzas were playing basketball to-gether in the driveway of their home in Memphis, Tennessee.
From age 6 to 11, Chiozza was 
always the smallest person on the 
court, and his sister, who is nearly 
10 years older than he is, used that to her advantage.
“She used to post me up. Every 
time,” Chiozza said. “She was big-ger than me, so I couldn’t do much about it.”
But that never stopped him from 
trying.
“Even then, you could see the 
determination in him. He never gave up,” his sister said. “He always was like, ‘I’m gonna get past you.’ Even then, he was little and quick. So, even though he didn’t think he was gonna get past me, he always did. I was never quick enough for him.”
Size has always been an obstacle 
for Chiozza.
Even now, at 6 feet, Chiozza is 
almost always the smallest player on the ﬂ  oor. With some players stand-ing up to 6-foot-11, 6-foot-10 and 6-foot-9, Chiozza rarely comes up to his teammates’ shoulders. But he’s never seen his size as a barrier, and despite his smaller frame, he’s al-
ways played tough.
“His dad always made him play 
with the older kids,” said Curtistine 
Chiozza, Chris’ mother. “So, with him being little, he has the tenden-cy to get knocked around, and my husband felt like we needed to make him tougher.”
It did make him tougher.
Despite having to battle signiﬁ  -
cantly larger opponents, Chiozza is 
consistently a force on defense and on the boards.
In the NCAA Tournament’s 
Round of 64 matchup with ETSU, with the Buccaneers bidding for a 
comeback in the second half against 
the Gators, Chiozza fearlessly leapt into a frenzy of players after a missed shot. Amid a sea of massive sweaty bodies and dangling arms and legs, Chiozza came away with the ball.
“I’m always down there with the 
big guys, ﬁ  ghting them. I’ve always been like that.” Chiozza said. “I try to hit them ﬁ  rst before they hit me. And if I do get hit, I’m shaking it off and going right back at them.”
It’s a quality that’s not lost on his 
coach, who, like Chiozza and much of the team, has never experienced the pressures of March Madness before.“He’s a starter who’s coming off 
the bench,” White said of Chiozza. “For him to be rebounding the ball the way he’s rebounding it with his 
size shows you the toughness that 
he’s playing with, the tenacity that he’s playing with.”
“He’s a true competitor”
Chiozza doesn’t complain.
Not when he used to play one-
on-one with his sister, where he was almost always on the losing end. 
Not when he was in high school, 
where he was underlooked because of his small frame. 
Not when his ﬁ  rst college coach, 
Florida legend Billy Donovan, bolted for an NBA gig. 
Not during the low point of Flor-ida’s season, where the coaching staff was struggling to remedy the team’s woes. 
And certainly not now.
When the Gators take the court 
at Madison Square Garden for their 
Sweet 16 matchup with Wisconsin tonight, the past won’t matter.
When that orange leather ball 
ﬁ  nally slides across his ﬁ  ngertips in 
the most important game of his life, 
Chiozza will be ready to battle.
“If he’s pushed to give you more, 
he’ll give you more. He’ll do what-ever he feels like is necessary in or-der to obtain whatever needs to be done,” his mom said. “He’s a true competitor in the sense that he does not like to give a half-hearted effort. I think he loves to give his whole heart into whatever it is that he does.”

defend and rebound at the highest possible 
level.”
Robinson wasn’t Florida’s main char-
acter during the regular season. That role 
was ascribed to leading scorer KeVaughn Allen or big-ticket transfer Canyon Barry. 
But that hasn’t stopped Robinson from 
taking center stage in Florida’s March Mad-ness run. Whether it’s scoring a season-high 24 points against East Tennessee State or spreading the story of White quoting Mi-gos’ “Pipe It Up," Robinson has been at the forefront of Florida’s postseason presence. 
“It’s just fun,” Robinson said. “We’re 
winning. Everyone’s playing together. It’s a loose and free atmosphere, and every-one’s focused on one goal.”
Tonight in New York City, the Gators’ 
goal will be defeating No. 8 seed Wiscon-sin, a team that’s coming off a huge upset 
win over last year’s champion and No. 1 
seed Villanova. 
“When I think of Wisconsin the past 
couple years, I think toughness, skill level, 
high-level defensive team, really consis-
tent,” White said. 
Really consistent is right. The Badgers 
(27-9) have made 19 consecutive NCAA Tournaments, while the Gators are playing 
their first in three seasons. 
“I understand why a lot of people will 
pick Wisconsin in this one,” White said. 
“And I think our guys understand it too. 
Maybe it’s an added motivation. Maybe it’s 
not. 
“Does it have anything to do with the 
outcome of the game? Heck, I don’t know.”

Despite being labeled the Saturday guy, 
Poche’s season has been one of the best 
in the SEC. It includes a no-hitter and a 
league-best 0.25 ERA and 5-0 record. 
“Obviously his numbers speak for 
themselves,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “He’s had a really good start to the year.”
The offensive numbers for both sides 
tell a different story. 
LSU enters hitting .317 as a team, good 
for second in the SEC. Leading the way for 
the Tigers is Cole Freeman and his .400 
average, and Greg Deichmann’s league-leading eight home runs. Florida, on the other hand, has strug-
gled to the tune of a .243 average, next to 
last in the conference.
But UF's players are hoping to bounce 
back against the No. 4 team in the country 
and forget about a slow start to confer-
ence play that saw them get swept by Au-
burn last weekend. 
Third baseman Jonathan India, who hit a team-best .350 vs LSU last year, said there’s no need to worry about his team. 
In time, the Gators will hit, he reas-
sured. 
“Once we start clicking, we’ll be a 
scary team,” India said. “We’ll be fine. 
We’re all right.”

The Gators didn’t go to work on 
March 17. Coach Roland Thornqvist 
said they weren’t prepared. They lacked conﬁ  dence. And they ulti-mately paid the price, losing their ﬁ  rst match of the season to rival Georgia, 4-1. 
“If you don’t come with your brown bag lunch and hard hat every day, you’re going to get punished,” Thornqvist said. “And we didn’t on Friday. Georgia ate our lunch.”
However, Florida responded the 
following Sunday with a 4-0 rout over No. 23 Tennessee. This level of play is something the Gators hope to continue as they move forward using the loss as newfound motivation. 
“From here on out, (our focus) is just on getting better and better,” Josie Kuhlman said.
“Honestly, we’re glad we had a loss 
now and not later in the season.”
The Gators will need this 
motivation as they go on the road this weekend, facing No. 18 Arkansas today and Missouri on Sunday. As Florida prepared for today’s match, Thornqvist said he anticipates that Arkansas coach Michael Hegarty will have “something up his sleeve” for the Gators. But Thornqvist thinks his team is up to the challenge. 
“We’re really ready to play,” 
he said. “I think you see that, too. We’re hungry to continue to play, to continue to get better and play other teams. We’re excited.”

Florida junior Alex McMurtry 
was named both the SEC Gymnast and Scholar-Athlete of the Year on Thursday, becoming the ﬁ  rst Gator in school history to earn both titles in the same season. 
McMurtry was the SEC Cham-
pionship all-around winner and was one of only two gymnasts in nation to score 10.0 in three 
events in 2017 (ﬂ  oor, vault and 
bars). She also leads the Gators 
with 16 event wins this season (6 
bars, 4 vault, 3 beam, 2 ﬂ  oor, 1 
all-around).
As an applied physiology and 
kinesiology major with a focus on exercise physiology, McMurtry 
has a 4.0 grade point average.The last time a Gator was se-
lected as SEC Gymnast of the Year 
was Kytra Hunter in 2015.
In addition, McMurtry and 
teammates Kennedy Baker, Ra-chel Slocum, Alicia Boren and Amelia Hundley were all named to the All-SEC Team. 
Hundley, as well as Rachel 
Gowey, were recognized as All-SEC freshmen, with Hundley notching the top score on bars for a freshman (9.90) and 
Gowey having the top freshman 
score on beam (9.90) at the SEC Championships.
The awards were determined 
by a vote from coaches within the 
conference.
