The Hermanator is coming 
to UF.
Former Republican presi-
dential candidate Herman Cain 
will speak at 6 p.m. in Emerson 
Alumni Hall as part of the na-
tional Truth Tour sponsored by Job Creators Solutions.
“The main thing we’re try-
ing to do here is get the word out about the importance of being an educated voter,” said Job Creators Solutions’ logistics assistant Jordan Hansen. “He 
wants to see this country go in 
a positive direction, and the idea was, this is the next genera-tion.”But some UF students aren’t 
too crazy about Cain coming to town.
“He’s fallen by the wayside,” 
said 18-year-old aeronauti-cal and aerospace engineering freshman Charlie Zumbahlen. “He’s not really prominent in today’s politics. You don’t really hear of him anymore.”
Public relations freshman 
Lawrence Grimm, 18, said he will probably attend the event, but just because Cain is nation-ally known.
But 22-year-old ﬁ  nance se-
nior Trent Smyers is excited to hear Cain speak.
“He’s good because he cur-
rently brings debate, which is a good thing,” Smyers said.Herman Cain to raise

To disprove a nearly 30-year-old rule of 
quantum physics, scientists had to travel to 
the coldest spot in the known universe — 
30 feet below UF’s campus.
In an international collaboration, scien-
tists used a superconductor, magnets and a 
series of refrigerators to measure the atomic 
spin of subatomic particles called bosons as 
they transitioned into the Bose-glass phase, said Neil Sullivan, a UF physics professor 
and director of the National High Magnetic 
Field Laboratory High B/T Facility. 
In this state, individual particles that 
make up a material begin to act as a single 
coherent unit.
The experiment was conducted at the  
Microkelvin laboratory and was funded by 
the National Science Foundation.
“There are only one or two places in the 
world you can do this,” Sullivan said. “UF has the leading facility.”Two theorists, Tommaso Roscilde at the 
University of Lyon in France, and Rong Yu from Rice University in Houston, devel-oped the underlying ideas for the study, according to a press release. These chal-
lenged a precedent established in 1985 
about how the strength of a magnetic ﬁ  eld affects the rate that bosons transition into the Bose-glass phase.
Scientists used a crystalline sample 
doped with impurities for the experiment to simulate a real-world scenario, accord-ing to the release.
“When you build a superconductor 
there are going to be imperfections,” Sul-livan said. “Knowing how disorder affects these systems is very important.”
The crystal’s temperature was dropped 
in a series of refrigerators to slow down 
the particles inside to an observable speed. 
For this experiment, temperatures were brought one-thousandth of a Kelvin above absolute zero, about -459.67 degrees Fahr-
enheit, according to the release.
Then, an organic quantum magnet 
swept the crystal with magnetic ﬁ  elds UF lab experiment disproves 30-year rule of quantum physicsLAURA HOGAN

UF students can get free ﬂ  u 
shots today at the Student Health 
Care Center.
The “mass vaccination event” 
will occur from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on the front lawn of the center, Catherine Seemann, the center’s 
marketing coordinator, said. The 
ﬁ  rst 500 students vaccinated will receive a free T-shirt.
To receive a free shot, students 
must bring their Gator 1 card and will need to ﬁ  ll out a consent form on-site, she said.
Though intramuscular ﬂ  u 
shots will remain free for stu-dents for the rest of the year, the center hopes the event will en-courage more people to be vac-cinated earlier in the ﬂ  u season, 
Seemann said. Intradermal shot and FluMist vaccination options 
are available for $15, according to the center’s website.
The 2012-2013 ﬂ  u vaccine is 
designed to protect against three strains of inﬂ  uenza experts pre-dict will be most common this season. One strain resembles H1N1, or “swine ﬂ  u,” and an-
other strain is similar to the 2010 
epidemic ﬂ  u strain, according to the center’s website.As of Wednesday morning, 
about 100 students were pre-reg-
istered online for the event. The 
center hopes to vaccinate at least 500 students today.Biology and nutrition senior 
Leshawn Richards has already 
registered to receive his ﬂ  u shot. 
He said he thinks the precaution is important for everyone.
“It can really save a lot of time 
and hassle for you, because if you do get the ﬂ  u, then you feel aw-ful,” Richards, 22, said. “Espe-cially because it’s my senior year, I don’t want to miss anything be-
cause I’m sick.”

ON FRIDAY AT 6 P.M. KATHRYN VARN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Just days after first lady Michelle 
Obama spoke on campus, Josh Rom-
ney, son of Republican presidential can-didate Mitt Romney, is coming to UF.
Josh Romney will be speaking at 6 
p.m. Friday in Room 270 of Weil Hall. He’s planning to rally grassroots Mitt Romney supporters, said Katy Melchi-orre, chairwoman of the UF College Republicans.
The candidate’s son will be speak-
ing about Romney’s platform and will give a perspective on Mitt Romney not many people have the opportunity to 
encounter, Melchiorre said.“I’m just glad to hear from someone 
that is so close to Mitt Romney,” she 
said. “We know his stance on political issues. He’ll be able to comment on oth-er aspects of his father.”
The Romney campaign headquar -
ters in Boston contacted the UF College Republicans to arrange the visit, Mel-chiorre said.
Student Government External Af-
fairs director Billy Vranish hopes stu-dents from both sides will attend the event.
“If you know you’re going to vote 
one way in November,” he said, “that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t know what’s going on on either side.”
Vranish predicts many political 
speakers will come to UF.
“We are the flagship university in a 
battleground state,” he said. “We’re go-ing to get a lot of political activity.”Romney's son to visit UF

When Matt Pesek got dressed Monday , he 
didn’t know his T-shirt choice would ruin his 
plans.
The 20-year-old political science and reli-
gion senior is a passionate Republican whose 
drawers are full of political T-shirts.
“I have dozens,” he said. “It’s all I wear.”
Pesek might not have noticed he was wear -
ing a “Gators for McCain/Palin” shirt, but the Obama for America staff at first lady Michelle Obama’s speech at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center did. He said he was denied entrance to the event.
“I was looking forward to it for quite a 
while,” Pesek said. “They acted like she’s not my first lady, too. Even though I have different political views, I’d like to see the wife of the 
president speak.”
Pesek said a volunteer outside the venue 
with a “250-pound backup” told him he had 
to leave and surrender his ticket. The volun-teer said the speech was for Obama support-ers, Pesek said.
“We allow anyone and everyone to attend 
our events. In this particular case, the individ-ual was asked to leave by university officials 
after he became disruptive in line,” wrote a 
campaign official in an emailed statement. 
Pesek said he turned the shirt inside-out, 
and he offered to ask a friend to bring him a “Gators for Obama” T-shirt to wear. He even waited another hour in the line to try getting in again with another ticket.“I was not going down easily,” Pesek said.The event was privately hosted by Obama 
for America, UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said. The O’Connell Center was rented to the organization, and it distributed tickets inde-pendently.
Sikes said privately host-
ed events are controlled by independent organizers.
“The decision to limit 
entry to the event was made by the Obama campaign and not the University of 
Florida,” she said.
When Pesek was pro-
testing the entry denial, 
Dean of Students Jen Day Shaw came up and asked the campaign volunteers to let him in, Sikes said. They didn’t.
“She did speak to the student but had no 
say in the decision,” Sikes said.
Sikes said Shaw and other Dean of Stu-dents employees were circulating the lines as a “safety precaution,” taking care of those waiting in line experiencing heat exhaustion 
or helping handicapped visitors find the cor -
rect entrances.
Sikes said a similar incident happened 
when George W. Bush came to campaign in 
Gainesville in 2004, and Secret Service mem-bers removed Democrats from the event.
Pesek said he once went to a Joe Biden 
speech in a “Joe the Plumber”-themed T-shirt, a reference to a conservative middle-class 
man featured in the 2008 Republican cam-
paign. He wore a Mitt Romney campaign shirt while picking up free tickets last week to see Obama.
Pesek said he was surprised to be denied 
entry to Obama’s speech Monday.
“I don’t think that’s how these events 
should be,” he said. “I didn’t think it’d be a big deal. That’s a sad day for the country when 
you polarize the country like that.”UF student denied entry to first lady Michelle Obama speech

Three men with outstanding 
warrants were arrested by the 
U.S. Marshals Florida Regional Fugitive Task Force in Levy and Marion counties Tuesday. 
A press release from deputy 
U.S. Marshal Bryon Carroll gave the following account:
The task force, which consisted 
of officers from the U.S. Marshals, Alachua County Sheriff’s Office, Gainesville Police Department and other county sheriff’s offices, made the first arrest at about 10:45 
a.m. Tuesday in Ocala.
Through an investigation, po-
lice located Jay Mendez in the 
Carlton Arms of Ocala Apartment complex.
Mendez, 36, was wanted on 
a Citrus County Sheriff’s Office warrant for two counts of each of the following charges: burglary, dealing in stolen property and grand theft.
Task force members surround-
ed the apartment and ordered 
Mendez to exit.
Police booked him into Marion 
County Jail with a $15,000 bond, 
according to jail records.
The second 
arrest came almost two hours later in Middleburg, 
located about 
24 miles north-east of Starke.
The task 
force looked 
for Charles Ellis, who was wanted on a Levy County Sheriff’s Office warrant for sexual battery and sexual molestation of two chil-
dren, both under the age of 12. 
Officers found Ellis, 50, in a 
house when they ordered him to 
come out. Police later booked him into Clay County Jail on a $4 mil-lion bond.
Task force members arrested 
the final suspect, Joseph Smith, 
during a traffic stop in northwest 
Ocala.
Smith, 32, was wanted on a 
federal warrant from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.
Inside Smith’s car, police found 
a loaded handgun, cocaine, mari-
juana and a large sum of cash.
Task force members arrested 
Smith at about 1:30 p.m. and later 
charged him with possession of a weapon, armed drug traffick-ing and drug possession, among other charges.
Police booked Smith into Mar -
ion County Jail later that day. A 
bond was not set as of Wednes-
day evening.

20,000 times stronger than 
Earth’s magnetic field, causing the bosons to transfer into the 
Bose-glass phase.
It took scientists six months 
to sweep the magnets about 
150 times at 10 different tem-
peratures.
“We have to sweep very 
slowly or else it heats up the 
sample,” said Liang Yin, an assistant scientist in the UF 
physics department who oper -
ated the equipment in the Mi-
crokelvin laboratory.
The scientists found that the 
rate at which bosons transition is a much sharper function of magnetic field, Sullivan said. The findings were published 
today in the journal “Nature.”
One current use of quan-
tum technology is using su-
perconductors used to power 
MRI scanners. 
In the future, quantum 
knowledge could be used for 
developing quantum comput-ing, alternative energy and 
magnetic levitation for trains, 
according to the release.
“We are testing a funda-
mental quantum theory,” 
Sullivan said. “I think that 
in 20 years my students will say why didn’t they think of that.”

Days after a video leaked 
about presidential nominee Mitt 
Romney telling supporters that 
47 percent of the nation is overde-
pendent on government support, the nationwide discussion has trickled down to Gainesville.
Across the city, people chat-
tered. Two veterans and a minis-ter sat outside of the downtown Starbucks late Wednesday morn-ing, sipping coffee and discussing 
the newly termed “47 percent.”
Democrats planned a roundta-
ble meeting Wednesday to speak 
their peace.
At the Organizing for America 
headquarters, at 315 SE Second Ave., 60-year-old mental health psychologist Dawn Burgess-Krop talked with two other Democrats about why she feels Romney has his facts wrong.
“When I hear Mitt Romney 
talk about us being victims and wanting a handout from the gov-
ernment, I don’t 
know who he’s 
talking about 
— some imagi-nary people I don’t know,” 
Burgess-Krop 
said.
T h o m a s 
Hawkins, a 32-year-old city com-missioner at large, spoke about 
how the government has helped 
him out with paying back student loans and his mortgage.During this national debate, 
Republicans have come to Rom-ney’s aid.
“It’s not that he doesn’t care 
about these people,” said Katy 
Melchiorre, chairwoman of UF 
College Republicans. “He just feels their vote is a lost cause.”
Frank Moehrle, chairman of 
Gators for Romney, said he thinks the ordeal has been blown out of proportion.
“It’s more of media story than 
anything else,” he said.
Alex Masi, Gators for Obama 
co-chairman, said he feels Rom-ney should apologize for his re-marks.
“I think it’s time Mitt apolo-
gized to the American people for his comments for students like me,” he said. “I’m not a victim.”

ALACHUA COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS.

Trendy techno music and neon paint will 
splash the Alachua County Fairgrounds 
this weekend when Life in Color hits town.
The internationally touring music show, 
formerly known as Dayglow, is making a stop in Gainesville on Friday night.
Antonio Mercado, the founder of Life 
in Color’s promotional company, said the event focuses on creating a total experi-
ence with world-class staging, lighting 
and sound in addition to the hallmark mu-sical performances and paint-ﬁ  lled can-nons that soak the audience.
“The paint is important, but it’s not the 
deﬁ  ning characteristic of Dayglow any-more,” Mercado said.
The music and paint look alluring, but 
22-year-old UF graduate student Hector McFarquhar said he’s excited for the over-all experience.
“It looks trippy,” the ﬁ  rst-year animal 
sciences graduate student said.
The show was originally slated to per-
form in Gainesville during Labor Day weekend, but Mercado said a missed ﬁ  ling deadline with the Alachua County Sher-iff’s Ofﬁ  ce for event security caused them to reschedule for later in the month.
“I think it ended up working out for the 
best,” Mercado said. “Friday night is prob-ably the biggest.” Mercado is optimistic about attendance. 
He said he estimates between 4,500 and 
5,000 people to show up. He said it’s been about four years since the show last vis-ited Gainesville.
“Lots of people were asking if it’s ever 
going to come back,” he said.Life in Color, formerly Dayglow, comes to Gainesville on Friday

Meet Jackson Ripley. He’s 12 years old and angry with 
Mitt Romney.
He wrote Romney a letter that details his frustra-
tions, many of which echo the feelings of other Americans. (We’ve left the quotes from his letter unedited for grammar, 
spelling, etc.)
He starts his letter with: “I’d like to say congratulations on 
winning the republican nomination. But, I wish you stayed in 
Massachusetts.You’re plan for America isn’t what we need, and would hurt us more than it would help.”
“I live in a middle class family , and two years ago my little 
sister; Kennedy was denied insurance because of her pre-exist-ing condition,” Jackson wrote. “Once the President was elected he put Obama Care into action, just like he promised and made 
it so that you could get insurance with pre-existing conditions. 
This has made a direct impact on my family . My family is with out a doubt better off now, than we were four years ago!”
His letter continues as he tries to explain his confusion with 
Romney’s exact plan for health care.
“It is to my understanding that you stated that you were go-
ing to repeal Obama Care, including the part I have mentioned, which will take away the insurance we have and need for my sister Kennedy,” Jackson said. “Why do you think she doesn’t 
deserve health care? Also, when you were interviewed on ‘Meet 
the Press’, you stated that you would NOT repeal this part of Obama Care, but then your campaign backpedalled and on the ‘Tonight show with Jay Leno’, you said that you WOULD repeal this.”
We don’t understand it either, Jackson.“Also, you’re domestic plans (birth control, gay rights etc.) 
are horrible!” Jackson said. “Women should get to manage their own health, and if you wonder why you’re not appealing to 
many women voters, rethink your birth control and women’s’ 
rights plans.”
Could not have put it better ourselves, dude.“And people should be able to marry whom they want,” 
Jackson wrote. “We built this country so people could have free-dom, and not have religious beliefs control them to that length. This country was in no way built on any religion, so we should not create laws that repress the American people in a religious way and hurt our most vulnerable.”
Not only does he stand up for marriage, he does it while ac-
cidentally using Romney’s own “We Built It” rhetoric against him.
His mom mailed the letter to The Hufﬁ  ngton Post and to 
Romney after Jackson wrote it last week. His strong emotions might be due to his little sister being diagnosed with congestive heart failure at 9 months old. She developed a hemangioma (a tumor of blood vessels) soon after she was born.
We should all be more like Jackson.
No matter who we support in any election, if we feel out-
raged, then we should speak out to those who make us angry . 
Thank you, Jackson, for teaching us all a lesson and remind-
ing us to use our rights.Some people never know when to be quiet. And other 
people never know when to speak up.
But when a life is on the line, it’s time to raise 
the bar.
I have been an avid Taylor Swift fan since her early 
country days. My obsession with her music has led me to two of her concerts, and her songs are the most played on my iTunes account.
On Sept. 7, she earned every ounce of my respect. She 
took the stage at Stand Up to Cancer’s telethon and sang a song that reached into the depths of every listener’s soul. “Ronan” is more than just the title of her latest hit. It is the true story of a 4-year-old boy who fought neuro-blastoma, a type of childhood cancer, and passed away 
16 months ago after an eight-month battle with the dis-
ease.
Swift wrote the song from the viewpoint of Ronan’s 
mother, Maya Thompson, who has kept a daily blog since the day her son was diagnosed. Thompson is cred-ited as the co-author of the song because her words were Swift’s template for the lyrics.
She captures Ronan’s life and evokes the pain and 
nostalgia that come with childhood cancer.
When people think about cancer, they often do not 
fully comprehend the commitment and courage it takes to ﬁ  ght the battle. The song follows a journey that thou-sands of children and families go through. The many months spent in a hospital room become a reality for listeners who otherwise may never have this personal experience.
This song serves a greater purpose than causing tears. 
It transmits the universal message of the bravery of 
childhood cancer that many people have yet to hear. The 
children ﬁ  ghting for their lives, along with their families, deserve every chance for a cure. 
By increasing awareness, more money will be invest-
ed into the cause, and new strides will be taken to end the disease. Thompson started The Ronan Thompson Foundation with the goal of increasing survival rates of children affected by neuroblastoma and other forms of pediatric cancer.
Swift’s courage to delve into 
such a heart-wrenching topic shows her true character not only as a musician but as a per-
son.
All proceeds from “Ronan” 
will be donated to the Taylor 
Swift Charitable Fund and will be used in the battle against pe-diatric cancer.
Compassion is not just a feeling that a person has 
upon seeing something they sympathize with. Rather, it is a response to that feeling and the action that is carried 
out. True compassion goes beyond recognizing a prob-
lem exists. Taking action to show support and dedication to a cause is where real compassion takes its role.
People often become trapped in their own worlds, 
ﬁ  lled only with their personal problems and worries.
This is one of society’s greatest ﬂ  aws.We have become oblivious to the tribulations of those 
around us, and fail to reach out even with a nod of ac-knowledgment.
Stories like Ronan’s will never be heard unless some-
one voices them. And it doesn’t take a superstar to do so.
Awareness is the greatest weapon in the ﬁ  ght against 
a great number of issues facing society. The tired clichés of “there is strength in numbers” and “knowledge is power” are completely true.
Beyond the world of politics, social media and super-
ﬁ  cial worries, people are faced with a wide range of prob-
lems that may inhibit daily activities. Life often takes its 
own path and offers its own surprises.
September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. 
By empowering ourselves with knowledge, we can cre-ate a different future for the kids.

Editor’s Note: This letter is in response to 
Anayo Ordu’s Tuesday column, “Voter apathy is 
absolutely pathetic.” 
I disagree, with every fiber of my being, 
with every statement that you made in your 
recent column about voter apathy. 
Your claim is that (a) someone fought for 
my right to vote, therefore, (b) I am indebted 
to that person, and (c) I must repay that debt by voting. Let me present a couple of parallels. You do realize that voting is not the only right we may exercise, don’t you? For instance, I have the right to own a gun. So can’t we apply the same logic you used? (a) Someone fought 
for my right to own a gun, therefore (b) I am 
indebted to that person and (c) I must repay that debt by owning a gun. Your rejoinder will be that owning guns and voting are two different issues, but that doesn’t refute the logic (your logic) that I used. They’re differ -
ent issues, but they are both rights, so why do I get the feeling that you wouldn’t share the same sentiment you do about exercising gun 
ownership rights as you do for voting rights? 
Here’s another: I have the right to marry , and I hope one day that I’ll live in a world where everyone will have the right to marry whom he or she loves. Those rights, when they come to pass, will be rights that were fought for by the people of this generation. Does that mean I 
should marry gay because someone fought for 
my right to marry gay?
You espouse these beliefs under the guise 
of freedom, “Life itself is about making choic-es.” But it seems that you’re trying to say that the choice to abstain from voting is not a valid choice. It is my right to choose to not exercise the right to vote. You said that we should hon-or the people who fought for our freedoms 
and not four sentences later, you said that 
people should be federally required to vote. You do realize that it’s no longer a right when the government forces you to do it, don’t you? When I pay my taxes, I don’t think of it as ex-ercising my right to pay taxes.  You contradict yourself in your own opinion. Either voting is a right or it should be federally required. You can’t have both of them.
Here is an economist’s and statistician’s per -
spective on voting.: V oting requires a cost in spent time and effort with little to no payoff other than some sense of having performed one’s “civic duty .” 
The likelihood of affecting the outcome of an election is on par with the likelihood of win-ning the lottery. The cost of playing the lottery is greater than the expected payoff from play-ing the lottery. With this being the case, many people do not play the lottery. Similarly, peo-ple abstain from voting because their expected payoff is far outweighed by their expected cost of voting. You will just have to accept that 
some people place no value on this arbitrary, 
contrived sense of “civic duty” that people like you try to shove down the throats of others. 
The effort spent in making an informed 
decision about a voting issue is often greater than the expected reward from making that decision. But what if you cannot discern a sub-stantial advantage voting in favor of one is-sue/candidate over another? Should you vote 
for yourself even if you don’t have a chance of 
winning?More logic for you: People in other places 
do not have the rights we do, therefore we should exercise them. There are rights I have that others don’t and that I choose not to ex-ercise. I am not obligated to exercise the rights 
that others do not have. That’s why they’re 
called “rights.”
I do not vote because my vote does not 
make a difference. No general election has ever been decided by one vote. And if an elec-tion ever came down to one vote, a mandatory recount would take place, and another Florida 2000 fiasco would take place. Your rejoinder will be that if everyone who thought as I do de-
cided to vote, then maybe the outcome would 
be different. And I agree. But if you were to still remove my vote from that new scenario, the outcome would be unchanged by the lack of my vote.
I have many more reasons for not voting. I 
challenge you to refute them all. I understand that your column is an opinion column, but I would at least hope that you would use sound 
logic and not contradict yourself.

Speaking Out
I am writing in response 
to Anayo Ordu’s column per -
suading others to vote. She 
states that if you are eligible to vote, you “need to” and that no 
excuse for the contrary will suf-
fice. Ordu continues, “V oting should be federally required, like filing taxes.”
I agree that voting is a privi-
lege that should not be taken for granted. However, it is a privilege, not a requirement. I wholeheartedly wish that the 
masses would educate them-
selves on the issues and then vote accordingly (whether it would agree with my personal opinions or not).
Unfortunately , this is not the 
case. Political ignorance runs rampant throughout our coun-try .  While encouraging people 
to get out and vote seems justi-
fiable at first glance, it has un-foreseen consequences.
If people do not care enough to vote without encourage-ment, one could logically rea-son that they are not politically informed. This type of person, if prodded enough, could reg-
ister to vote and then follow 
through, basing their vote on information they’ve garnered from those horrid, negative   political ads. Do we want this type of person influencing the direction of our country based on nothing more than slander?
Providing ample opportu-
nity to vote is necessary. Prod-ding people to vote until they feel socially pressured to do so is reprehensible. If people wish to remain uninformed, it is their right to do so; I simply ask you not to pressure them into voting rashly. Ordu’s ad-vocacy of a mandate to vote is 
not only unconstitutional, it is 
ignorant.

A whole new world will open 
its doors in Gainesville this fall — a 
World of Beer that is.  
World of Beer will open in New-
berry’s Tioga Town Center in No-
vember or December, said Thomas 
Popa, partner at World of Beer.
“We just want to provide a com-
fortable place where everyone in 
the community feels welcome to 
share a beer, enjoy friends, watch the game or listen to some great live music,” he said.
The establishment will have 
about 500 bottles of beer and 40 drafts on tap, Popa, 35, said. It plans to host family-friendly events for 
the community throughout the year 
generally geared toward music.
He said Tioga Town Center will 
be a great fit for the establishment, although expanding to another lo-
cation near campus in the future is 
a strong possibility.
Tioga Town Center business 
owner Dave Anders, 49, of Dave’s 
New York Deli, said he looks for -
ward to being neighbors with 
World of Beer.
“New business is important for 
the Town Center,” Anders said, 
“and World of Beer will be a great 
addition to the mix of businesses we have now.”
He said the large selection of 
beers should evoke a positive reac-tion from students.    
Tioga is about 11 miles from the 
UF’s main campus.
Stephen Reyes, a 22-year-old ad-
vertising major at UF, said he feels great about the opening of World of Beer in Gainesville. However, he said, it won’t be conveniently locat-ed for students.UF journalism senior Kaitlyn 
Sullivan, 22, said she doesn’t see the franchise gaining a lot of stu-dent popularity because similar establishments, such as Gainesville House of Beer, are closer to cam-
pus.
While Gainesville House of Beer, 
the smaller company, parallels the 
larger incoming franchise in atmo-
sphere, Aaron Salgado, 29-year-old 
manager at Gainesville House of Beer, said the opening of World of Beer won’t be a disadvantage to ei-ther business.
Salgado said his company wel-
comes anyone willing to promote craft beer and make Gainesville one of Florida’s premier markets for quality beer.  
“It’s just another chance to re-
alize there’s an entirely different, exciting world out there beyond the macro brews of Bud, Miller and 
Coors,” he said.
Popa said World of Beer is set to 
operate from 3 p.m. to 2 a.m. Mon-
day through Thursday and noon to 2 a.m. Friday through Sunday. 
Prices will range from $3 beers to 
$300 bottles, with an average over -
all price of about $5 per beverage.
“We hope the community will 
be as excited as we are to open in 
Gainesville,” Popa said. “People 
everywhere are starting to drink better beer, Gainesville included.”

The sun pours into WolfWax 
Culture from the floor-to-ceiling 
windows that curve with the building. A Prairie Ramblers re-cord plays for what is likely the 
first time in decades. The scratch-
es and skips of the record do not bother patrons — it’s what brings the shop to life.
Simple white shelves are all that 
the shop really needs — a place for Gainesville residents to browse 
through the eclectic merchandise, 
like comic books and records, that WolfWax Culture has spent years acquiring.
Located at 101 N. Main St., 
WolfWax Culture is on the second floor of the corner building where Gifthorse used to be.
The store is testing out a soft 
opening with hours from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. every day except Mondays. WolfWax Culture won’t have its official opening until late October.
Joe Wolf and his friend Bobby 
Harper own the store, which main-ly sells comic books and records. Their merchandise varies greatly and includes retro boomboxes, 
concert T-shirts, nonfiction books, magazines and record players.
“I’ve got so many old maga-
zines and things,” Wolf said. “Why 
not pass along the things we love to someone who is going to find 
this gem they would have never known about?”
Wolf, 45, is a 
Gainesville Re-gional Utilities worker, Grow Radio volunteer, 
UF alumnus and self-proclaimed 
music addict.
WolfWax Culture shares its loca-
tion with the also recently opened 
Arrow’s Aim Records. The two stores are split between two lev-els — WolfWax on the second floor and Arrow’s Aim on the first.
Though completely separate 
businesses, the two hope to share customers.
“Only in Gainesville could a 
place like this happen. We share our space and our customers,” Wolf said.
Arrow’s Aim owner, Daniel Ha-
lal, agreed that most record-shop-goers would most likely be inter -
ested in comic books as well.
Halal approached Wolf about 
sharing the space after he saw it 
had become available in August.
“I’ve always loved this build-
ing,” he said. “I love this corner of 
the street, so I rented it.”
The building features curved 
walls, an old narrow wooden stair -case and just the right amount of 
charm.
Linguistics and Russian junior 
Helen D’Avanza, 20, stumbled 
upon the shop while she was walk-ing through downtown.
“They might do well in the 
wake of Wayward Council shut-ting down,” D’Avanza said. “It provides a healthy competition 
for other record and book stores. 
Just something different from the norm.”
D’Avanza said she will frequent 
WolfWax Culture for their unique merchandise.
“I’ve appreciated what goes 
on in our community and now to contribute to it, it’s very exciting,” 
Wolf said.

Flashbacks  Lounge, located at 211 W. University Ave. offers a menu with 38  mixed-drink shots.  Unique 
flavors include banana cream pie, chocolate cake, applesauce and pumpkin pie.
PHILLIP NUNLEY

With flavors like banana cream 
pie, pumpkin pie and chocolate 
cake, you may think of delicious 
desserts rather than alcohol-
infused shots when ordering off  the menu at Flashbacks Lounge.
Located at 211 W. University 
Ave., Flashbacks Lounge opened in June and is now serving an extensive list of 38 shots. Prices range from $4 to $7 for two shots.  
Tatum Nichtberger, a 22-year-
old microbiology sophomore at Santa Fe College, developed the list of shots now served from the bar.  She said banana cream pie, 
chocolate cake and applesauce 
are the most popular.
“I came up with the list be-
cause we always have two-for-one mixed shots, but people were 
always asking for suggestions,” 
Nichtberger said.    
If you’re not into shots, there 
are plenty of other specials to 
take advantage of. Happy hour 
is from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m., with $2 singles and $4 doubles. When happy hour ends, prices go up a dollar.  
Whiskey is the spirit of the 
night on Wednesdays, with $2 
singles and $4 doubles all night. 
The prices remain the same Thursday, except with vodka as the alcohol of choice.
The specials continue with two 
Pabst Blue Ribbon beers for $3 or a PBR and shot of Jack Daniel’s, Jim Beam or Jameson Irish Whis-key for $5.
Flashbacks Lounge is open un-
til 2 a.m. seven days a week, and the café serves food until 1 a.m. Friday and Saturday.
On Friday nights, guests can 
enjoy the atmosphere while a Grooveshark DJ plays music.
The flavors on the menu, 
whether pumpkin pie, blueberry 
muffin, applesauce or blueberry 
pancake, taste exactly like their names. And luckily, the bartend-ers don’t use the cheapest liquor known to man.  
For a great-tasting drink at 
a price that won’t empty your wallet, Flashbacks Lounge is the place to try.Flashbacks Lounge offers new menu with 38 flavored shotsnightlife

Too often on Netflix, I find 
myself saying: “No, I do not 
want to watch ‘From Dusk ‘till Dawn 3,’ ‘Mean Girls 2’ or ‘Bad Girls From Mars’.” After the 
Qwikster fiasco and opposition 
from many of Hollywood’s larg-est production companies, some quality films are only attainable by paying extra. This leaves Net-flix’s “Watch Instantly” library filled with titles that are little more than cinematic santorum.
Even though Netflix attempts 
to tailor suggestions to individu-als’ likings, more often than not, it results in groups of sugges-tions with bizarrely specific ti-tles like “Sentimental Romantic Showbiz Movies.” If you don’t know what to look for, finding something good to watch is very difficult. However, lost in an 
endlessly growing queue and 
buried underneath thousands of rows of titles there are these few hidden Netflix gems:
 “I Saw the Devil” (2010)NR ( but not for children)142 minutes, Horror/Thrill-
er, Korean (English subtitles)
There’s a saying that “when 
going on a path of revenge, dig two graves.” I would add to that: Bring a camera crew, because the adventure will be awesome. Korean director Kim Jee-Woon’s “I Saw the Devil” is that adventure.
The movie follows Korean 
secret agent Kim Soo-hyeon (played by Byung-hun Lee from “G.I. Joe”) as he hunts the noto-
rious serial killer Jang Kyung-
chul (played by Min-sik Choi) who murdered his wife. Soo-hyeon’s strategy for exacting his revenge runs as follows: find, beat up, release and repeat. The serial killer, Kyung-chul, how-
ever, is not one to be trifled 
with. Beaten 
and bruised, Kynug-chul decides to fight back, re-sulting in an electric series 
of events.
Incorporating fast-paced 
martial arts fight scenes with tense and gritty characters and dialogues, “I Saw the Devil” will likely be unique from anything you’ve seen before.
You’ll like this movie if you 
enjoy gory thrillers, Asian cin-ema or kung fu movies.

movie you’ve already seen:

First comes love, then comes 
marriage, then comes the unex-
pected: divorce and best friend-
ship.
This may not be exactly how 
you remember the playground 
song from your youth, but it is, in 
essence, the beginning of Sony Pic-
tures Classics’ newest indie-dar -
ling “Celeste and Jesse Forever.”
Following in the footsteps of 
contemporary love stories such as “Juno” and “(500) Days of Sum-
mer,” “Celeste and Jesse Forever” 
is the latest, and arguably the smartest, film to ride the wave of new, realistic romantic comedies.
Despite six months of separa-
tion and plans to divorce, Celeste, played with charm and complex-ity by Rashida Jones, and Jesse, a breakout dramatic role for Andy 
Samberg, still spend every day 
together, to the chagrin of their friends. 
The exes are content with their 
arrangement until an unexpected rendezvous and a startling revela-tion by Jesse proves too much for Celeste. 
Just as “When Harry Met Sally” 
did more than two decades ago, “Celeste and Jesse Forever” poses a crucial question for its characters 
and audience to answer — can you 
ever be just friends with your ex?
The success of “Celeste and Jes-
se Forever” cannot be attributed to just one person or aspect, but rath-
er it is due to the amalgamation of 
authentic acting, witty writing and overall visual excellence.
The film’s leading lovers have 
shared a common address, NBC, 
where they have thrived in sup-
porting roles: Jones in “The Of-fice” and “Parks and Recreation,” and Samberg on “Saturday Night 
Live.” Faced with the task of star -
ring in a film 
has time and again proved insurmount-
able for many 
small-screen 
stars, but that is not the case 
for these two. 
The couple’s palpable chemistry 
shined in almost every scene, most notably while donning European accents or simulating inappropri-
ate acts.
As a driven businesswoman, 
Jones oozes quirky charisma, 
though she never appears annoy-
ing when lamenting failed rela-
tionships to her equally delightful friend Beth, portrayed by up-and-coming actress Ari Graynor. 
Celeste undergoes a complete 
transformation in stability and merit during the course of the film. Jones exceptionally captured this change with ease, proving that 
she is the kind of leading lady that 
young women can relate to and root for in the future.
Samberg continues to exude his trademark goofy charm, yet 
underscores it with a real sense 
of emotional believability. Elijah Wood and Emma Roberts delight-ed in their supporting roles as a loyal co-worker and budding pop 
star, respectively.
Jones and Will McCormack, 
who played the scene-stealing 
drug dealer Skillz, performed 
double-duty by also writing the 
captivating script. Balancing hu-mor and honesty, the film depicted modern-day love and all its flaws with much grace.
One of the most refreshing fea-
tures of the film was the brilliant camerawork. The stop motion opening montage was both an ef-
fective introduction to the plot 
and a visually stunning sight. Ac-companying many of the poignant scenes was an attentive musical compilation that can appeal to the 
secret hipster in all of us.
Some crude sexual and drug sit-
uations may irk certain adults, but 
college students will most likely 
applaud Jones and McCormack’s 
writing debut for its authentic ap-proach to this generation’s rela-tionships.
Judging by the audience of only 
four people in the theater, “Celeste and Jesse Forever” may not remain in Gainesville forever, so enjoy their quirky love while it lasts.
The film is playing at Regal

Dear Mediocre Advice,
A boy I was hanging out with accidental -
ly sent me a text meant for another girl. 
What’s the best way to get back at him?
Dear Friend,
I don’t know if getting back at him is the way to go here. Not all is lost. Guys are capable of having other lady friends. If it was a flirty text, that’s still not a big deal. You don’t know their relationship, and that leaves room for miscommunication, which could make you look like an ass. Maybe the text was meant for his sister — and they just have a very southern relationship. Text him back to tell him you know that text wasn’t meant for you. If he is two-timing you, just drop him. He’s a waste of time and probably likes his sister anyway.Dear Mediocre Advice,
What should I do if I just had incredible sex with the man of my dreams who looks like Thor, and I accidentally sleep-farted in his bed? Let it be known that this guy is so good-looking that he could smell like a baby-diaper 
Dumpster, and I would still bone him.

Dear Mediocre Advice,
I’m a 22-year-old girl, and I’ve never 
given a blow job. After overhearing stories from my guy friends about girls who sucked (both figuratively and liter -
ally), I’m scared about being bad. Is this silly?
Dear Friend,
That sucks — no pun intended. You could ask your close and experienced girlfriends what to do. At this point, if your first prey ends up being someone you’re not comfortable telling the truth to, you don’t have to admit you’ve never done the deed. BJs are not that big of a deal compared to other sexual activities. I do recommend you actually like the guy who you’re going to orally bless.Dear Mediocre Advice,
Ello again, Ursula. There’s this girl that I perceive as way out of my league. She writes an average advice column for a prestigious newspaper. How do I hook up?
Dear Mediocre Advice,
I want to get a boob job. What do you 
think?
Dear Friend,
I think it’s an unnecessary procedure and a waste of money, but I’m not your mom. You have the freedom to do what -
ever you want with your body — with the exception of matching friendship tattoos. Only get a matching friendship tattoo if you love regret and looking stupid.Dear person,
It’s never going to happen. Dear Mediocre Advice,
This dude I work with has asked me out in front of our co-workers several times and gets mad when I avoid him. How do I let him down gently without ruining 
our work relationship?
Dear Friend,
Don’t poop where you eat. This guy probably likes you more than you think if this is a consistent behavior, so be honest. Don’t make your work life dif -
ficult because you don’t want to hurt his feelings. Say you don’t date people you work with, and you feel awkward when he asks you out in front of others. This shouldn’t damage your work relationship because he’s being unprofessional any -
way. If your work relationship is ruined by something as simple as this, then
it’s not worth saving. Dear Mediocre Advice,
The boy I like wears a funny hat in public. I be -
lieve it is called a “newsboy cap” (I don’t know.Google it for pics). Is it messed up if I hide or steal it the next time I go over? I’ve already voiced my hate to no avail.
 Dear Friend,The only man on Earth who can pull that hat off is Jon Hamm (Google that). With few exceptions, no one likes that hat unless they’re the poor un -
fortunate soul wearing it. You’ve already told him it bothers you, so start making fun of him. Peer pressure him into burning the thing. Say, “Why are you wearing that? You’re not Jon Hamm.” If these tactics don’t work and it causes trouble in your rela -
tionship (which it probably will), you may just have to live with it and focus on more important things in your relationship.
Dear Wonderful Friend,
All you can do is hope your fart did not wake him. Hope to every force in the universe that he did not hear your ass make a sound and that it did 
not smell.
� “TEMPEST” IS DYLAN’S 
35TH STUDIO ALBUM.
NATALIA SIEUKARAN
Avenue Contributing Writer
In commemoration of a 50-year 
career, American singer-songwriter 
Bob Dylan reminds old and new fans of why he is the voice of his generation with his 35th album, 
“Tempest.”
“Tempest” is a true rock ‘n’ roll 
album that captures the best of 
America’s golden age of rock, jazz and blues into a dark, yet satisfying album.
The year 2012 has been a spe-
cial one for Dylan. In May, the folk singer was one of the recipients of a 
Presidential Medal of Freedom, the 
highest civilian award, for his con-tribution as a singer-songwriter to American music.
Next month, Dylan begins his 
tour.To promote the new album and 
tour, the marketing campaign used 
some different approaches.  Fans 
who visited www.listentobobdy-
lan.com found a map of locations where selected songs from “Tem-pest” were streamed. 
In addition, the day before the 
album’s release, pop-up stores opened in New York, Los Angeles and London to sell the album a day early alongside memorabilia.
This album is nothing like Dy-
lan’s older stuff, circa the ‘60s, but 
luckily, he has always been a ge-nius at capturing the times.
And since the times have 
changed, so have the 71-year-old’s melodies. There is a modern-day taste of Dylan’s poetic genius in 10 tracks.  
Despite the vocal changes wit-
nessed throughout the years, the singer’s voice has come to a point where it’s croaky, dry, yet honest 
and gritty to the core. A voice that could only work 
for this album majestically glides 
through each track as Dylan tells 
the story of an old America that is 
dark and bittersweet — themes fans loved in 2001’s “Love and Theft.”
The album 
starts with 
the single “ D u q u e s n e Whistle,” which is like a blast of 
fresh, yet famil-
iar air.  A little ragtime diddle quietly peers in 
and then bursts into a jazzy bass, plucking groove with a piano rag-ging alongside it.
“Spin” magazine described the 
single’s video as “Tarantino-esque,” 
which is no surprise, as the song it-
self takes you on a violent western ride that speaks of life’s troubles.
“Soon After Midnight” show-
cases Dylan’s sensitive side, as he sings of love. Under the song is a layer of contempt with the lyrics: “Two timing slim — who’s ever heard of him? I’ll drag his corpse 
through the mud.” 
It’s contrasted by the steel pedal 
guitar, which gives it a magical vibe 
that floats above the lyrics.
In “Pay in Blood,” Dylan sings 
about the pains of the human expe-rience under another pedal steel ac-companied by a steady snare tem-po — another contrast to the lyrics, 
as he sings, “Or how I survived so 
many blows. I’ve been through hell, what good did it do?”
Dylan ventures into his storytell-
ing trademark in “Tin Angel.” He tells a tale of doomed love, betrayal and murder. Musically, there’s no variation — the same humdrum going on for seven minutes — but 
its hypnotic effect draws you into 
the story of lost hope.
In 45 verses with no chorus, 
“Tempest” features violins that not only cry for the Titanic, but tell the listener what occurred during the ship’s demise.
After 32 years, in “Roll on John,” 
Dylan ruminates about the death of 
his friend and former Beatle John 
Lennon. 
Despite his darkness, this last 
track ends in hope when Dylan croaks, “Shine your light, move it on, you burn so bright, roll on John.”
The album is laced with history 
both lyrically and musically. Dylan 
portrays a sense of the ‘60s culture 
wafting in the wind of a postmod-ern world and sentiments of so-cial disorder, families and friends breaking away, and lost senses of humanity — themes that run in contemporary times.
It’s clear why he was deemed 
the voice of his generation: He is 
a genius at capturing the zeitgeist 
of the human experience. Now his songs and stories are social com-mentary worth listening to because they still resonate so clearly today and onward. THURSDAY , SEPTEMBER 20, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 11
CD review: Bob Dylan’s “Tempest” is modern yet classic
Dylan
MICHELLE PROVENZANO
Avenue Writer
Spicing up the local music scene 
less than a year ago, Project Chili’s 
start consisted of a rather modest 
hangout between childhood friends 
vibing to funk icons.
UF diving team member Sean 
Saley formed Project Chili with 
long-time friend and UF alumnus 
James Ghattas last November, after 
the disintegration of their local reg-gae band Half Track. The idea came 
about as a sudden realization of the 
friends’ shared love for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and a desire to fulfill 
their musical urge.
“We were listening to music one 
day, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers came on, and we were like ‘This is 
the last great American rock band,’” 
Ghattas said. “Sean wanted to work 
on forming a cover band, and I was all for it.”
The Red Hot Chili Peppers re-
leased its album “I’m With You” in August 2011, and Saley said it was perfect timing to start forming their 
band that fall.
“[Red Hot Chili Peppers] has 
been one of those consistent bands throughout my life that I’ve jammed 
out to on my iPod,” said Saley, a 22-year-old food and resource eco-
nomics senior. “It was great to start 
covering the songs I’ve listened to for years and at the same time, ex-
ploring their new stuff.”
Ghattas stepped into the position 
of lead singer and Saley inclined to-ward being the bassist of the band.
Saley recruited former div-
ing teammate Jon Speed to be the drummer.
Still in need of a guitarist, he put up fliers throughout campus, lead-
ing him to 21-year-old food and resource economics senior Bernie 
Green.
“Literally the same day I put up 
fliers, I got a call from Bernie,” he said. “We gave him one audition 
and that was all it took for us to want him.”
The band tried to start practices 
in different locations near campus 
but struggled to find a solid niche where they could jam.
“We tried 
practicing in friends’ houses or 
garages, but we 
would get the police called on us,” 
Saley said. “Finally, we were able 
to have our practices at my apart-
ment, but we had to play somewhat quietly.”
Coordinating schedules also 
proved to be a struggle.
“With four people all doing dif-
ferent things, it’s hard to get every-one together,” he said.
With time management, Project 
Chili got in enough practice time before its first show in February at High Dive, the venue formerly 
known as Double Down Live.
Saley said the feeling he got 
from the first show was one of the best experiences of his life.
“It’s so much fun getting hooked 
up. We can crank the volume up all the way and have a great time,” 
he said. “There’s so much energy 
to shows. It’s a very unique feel-
ing that most people don’t know about.”
Project Chili generated attention 
from fans of Red Hot Chili Peppers and the funk genre enough to land them a performance during UF’s Dance Marathon in the Spring se-
mester.
“We don’t just play to play. We 
do it for the shows,” Saley said. “We love going on stage, jumping 
around and getting the audience to sing along with us.”Project Chili looks to end its run 
as a band come the end of spring, with lead singer Ghattas attending 
medical school at Mercer Univer -
sity next year and the other mem-
bers graduating and moving out of 
Gainesville.
Until the band parts ways, Saley 
said he can’t wait to keep booking shows for Project Chili, including a 
special Halloween show on Oct. 31 at High Dive.
“Forming an original band con-
sumes your soul and your time,” Saley said. “I’d love to write my 
own music one day, but right now, 
I’m enjoying Project Chili.”12, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2012

Project Chili serves up last year of funk in GainesvilleLANDON WATNICK
Avenue Contributing Writer
During two visits to Gainesville last year, 
Porter Robinson mesmerized electro-house 
fans with his entrancing synths and unique 
mixes.
On Tuesday at 9 p.m., he will return to town 
with fellow DJ, Zedd.  
Robinson and Anton “Zedd” Zaslavski will 
share a back-to-back set at The Vault, 238 W. University Ave., for the Poseidon Tour. Up-
and-coming producer Nick Thayer will open for both artists.
Tickets for the 18-and-older show start at 
$35 and can be purchased at www.porterzed-
dgville.eventbrite.com.
Prices will rise as the show approaches 
sellout status, said Anthony Mercado of The 
Dynasty Group, which is putting on the event 
with Committee Entertainment.
“We just want to reward the early birds,” 
he said.
If a ticket to Dayglow on Friday is also pur -
chased, the price of admission is $25, since Robinson was originally scheduled to headline 
the event.
The idea for a back-to-back tour came to 
Robinson after seeing dubstep artists Doctor P 
and Flux Pavilion pull it off, Mercado said.
“It’s a great concept,” he said. “You get to 
hear the stylistic differences.”Robinson and Zaslavski are known for their 
genre versatility when experimenting with electronic music.
Zedd has remixed songs by The Black Eyed 
Peas, Swedish House Mafia and Lady Gaga. 
His new album, “Clarity,” will be released 
in October.
Criminology sophomore Cody Smith, 19, 
said he likes both producers’ complex and 
danceable music.
“I’m excited for just both of them playing 
back to back,” he said. “That’s not how DJs 
usually play. I just expect a 
lot of good vibes and posi-tive energy.” 
Anthony Benedettini, a 
19-year-old applied physi-
ology and kinesiology 
sophomore, has seen Rob-
inson three times in concert 
and Zedd twice, but plans to attend Tuesday.
“Both DJs are high-energy guys,” he said. 
“They play really lively stuff. They know how 
to keep the crowd going.”
Porter Robinson and Zedd are two of the 
top 10 producers in the game, Mercado said.
“It’s rare to get two artists that are peaking 
at this level and you put them under one roof at one price,” Mercado said. “It’s going to be 
a special show…. There’s no guarantee they’ll ever do this again.”Porter Robinson returns with Zedd
� “GLAZES OF COLOR” WILL 
BE SHOWN AT THORNEBROOK GALLERY UNTIL SEPT. 29.
CAROLINA GARCIA
Avenue Contributing Writer
Nestled in the oaks of the quaint 
Thornebrook Village, Thornebrook 
Gallery boasts the eclectic and se-
rene feeling that nationally recog-
nized artists like Peter Pettegrew find the best home for their prized pieces of art.
After a four-year break from 
shows in Gainesville, Pettegrew’s work returned to Thornebrook Gal-lery, at 2441-6D NW 16th Ave., where the Winter Park artist will ex-
hibit “Glazes of Color.”
The collection will hold 25 of the 
artist’s most recent landscape paint-
ings that are available for viewing 
and sale until Sept. 29.  
Pettegrew’s work highlights 
the colors and textures seen in the 
scenery of North Florida, which Gainesville residents will be able to 
enjoy in “Glazes of Color.”
In the last six months, Pettegrew has had shows in Orlando, Winter 
Park and Tampa with a paint out in 
Wekiva and a commission in North-
ern California, according to Thorne-brook Gallery owner David Arrighi.
Recognizing the artist’s high de-
mand and busy schedule, Arrighi will host “Glazes of Color” for three weeks as opposed to the usual two-week display opening that artists get at the gallery.
“He’s too popular to keep him up 
for only two weeks,” said Arrighi. “I 
mean, after four years and with the 
popularity of his 
work, he deserves three.”
T h o r n e b r o o k 
Gallery employee 
Tricia Fisher ex-
pressed excitement for the latest ex-
hibit.
“It’s great that Peter’s work 
is coming back to Gainesville,” Fisher said. “Really anything that breathes new life into art is good for Gainesville.”

show, call 352-378-4947 or visit www.thornebrookgallery.com.Artist displays paintings in

Florida Football Advising Heat-Related Precautions
Fans attending Saturday’s game are encouraged to 
stay hydrated and wear sunscreen and loose clothing. Temperatures are forecasted to approach 90 degrees.  Senior golfer Isabelle Lendl comes from an athletic family, with father Ivan a former tennis star and two sisters who golfed in the SEC. See story, page 19.

Defensive coordinator Dan Quinn shouts instructions to his defense during UF’s 37-
20 victory against Tennessee at Neyland Stadium on Saturday. 
END OF GREGULATION
Gators should ditch gimmicks     ◗ THE GATORS ROTATE MORE LINEMAN 
AND LINEBACKERS THAN IN 2011.
  JOE MORGAN
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  Coach Will Muschamp has led the Gators 
to a 3-0 start for a second consecutive year.
  Following Florida’s 37-20 win against 
Tennessee last Saturday, he said the unde-
feated start was “different” than last sea-son’s effort.
  A signiﬁ  cant change for the Gators has 
been their success in the fourth quarter. Last 
season, Florida was outscored 72-22 during 
the ﬁ  nal 15 minutes of Southeastern Confer-ence games.
  In 2012, the Gators have outscored op-
ponents 27-0 during the fourth quarter, in-cluding a 17-0 advantage in two SEC games. Defensive coordinator Dan Quinn chalks up the late-game improvement to a wealth of 
talent on defense.
  “One of the things with our club this 
year compared to last year is more depth 
across the ball where we play more players,” Quinn said. “That gives you the feeling that you can play longer into a game, and have 
a pass rush available for you at the end of 
the game.” 
  Even though Buck linebacker Ronald 
Powell is sidelined with an ACL tear, Florida 
has taken advantage of its numbers on the 
defensive line and at linebacker. The Gators 
have implemented a rotation in the front seven that has proved effective so far this 
season.
  “For us, it’s been kind of part of the plan 
to build some depth and be able to have more of a rotation where we could go longer 
into the games and feel like at the end of the 
games, we could still have a chance to affect 
the quarterback,” Quinn said.
  The rotation has worked due to an inﬂ  ux 
of talent. Powell may be out, but Quinn said 
linebacker Neiron Ball’s return to the ﬁ  eld 
has helped. 
Also, signiﬁ  cant contributions from fresh-
men Dante Fowler Jr. and Antonio Morrison have been key.
  “Guys have been fresh going to the fourth 
quarter,” nose tackle Omar Hunter said. 
“A lot of that has to do with our rota- UF enjoying depth in front seven

  Joker Phillips is ignoring the el-
ephant in the room.
  The strategy worked perfectly 
against Tennessee in 2011, so it’s 
what Kentucky will do when it 
visits Florida on Saturday in an 
attempt to end its 25-game losing streak against the Gators. 
  “We have not mentioned it,” 
Phillips said.
  He used the same approach as 
his team prepared for its season ﬁ  -nale in 2011 against Tennessee. 
The Wildcats hadn’t defeated 
the Volunteers since 1984. After 
not speaking a word about the 26-
game losing streak all week, Ken-tucky defeated Tennessee 10-7 in Lexington, Ky., on Nov. 26 to con-clude its season.
  “It’s been our theory, you know. 
Why bring those things up?” Phil-lips said. “You hear it enough out-side of here. Therefore, we don’t 
bring them up. We just try to con-
tinue to prepare the best way we can to play as good as we can.”  Phillips is very familiar with the 
lopsided series against the Gators. 
Before the losing streak began, 
he lost four straight to Florida as a wide receiver for Kentucky from 1981-84. He was an assistant coach 
for 16 losses during the streak and 
has been the head coach for two more. 
  While Phillips has a lot of his-
tory with the series, he does not expect his players to be affected 
by it.
  “A lot of those guys haven’t 
been a part of it,” Phillips said. 
“It’s such a young team. A lot Kentucky downplaying 
25-year losing streak  
“It’s been our theory, you 
know, why bring those things 
up? You hear it enough out-
side of here. Therefore, we 
don’t bring them up. We just 
try to continue to prepare 
the best way we can to play 
as good as we can.”

  Only one thing is keep-
ing coach Will Mus-champ from fully es-
tablishing Florida as a team known for toughness and physicality: his foolish, stub-born insistence on trick plays. 
  The Gators have accom-
plished more offensively in three weeks than I expected to see all season. 
Jeff Driskel looks like the 
real deal, Mike Gillislee leads the Southeastern Conference in rushing and the offensive line appears to be stronger 
and faster than it was a year 
ago. 
  With all of those pieces in 
place, Florida has turned into the team Muschamp wants it 
to be. 
The Gators run the ball, 
they play defense, they wear 
opponents down and they 
win the fourth quarter. 
  But Muschamp’s shenani-
gans don’t ﬁ  t that mold, and 
they’re keeping the transfor-mation one step shy of com-
pletion. 
  It’s not only one call. It’s 
every week so far this season. 
  One drive after Tennessee scored to take a 20-13 lead, 
Muschamp called for a fake punt on fourth-and-9 at his 
own 42 — a move he later ad-
mitted was a mistake.
And it wasn’t just any fake 
punt, it was a wacky direct 
snap to Trey Burton, who 
pitched to unlikely recipient Matt Elam, who had to break a tackle in the backﬁ  eld to even get half of the necessary yard-
age. 
  If Elam hadn’t come 
through with a sack on the 
next play, the game eas-
ily could have spiraled out of 
control. 
  Of course, Muschamp al-
most put the Gators in a hole much earlier. 
On UF’s ﬁ  rst play from 
scrimmage, Driskel handed to Matt Jones, who made a re-verse pitch to Andre Debose. 
But Debose never received the 
ball; Florida was lucky to re-cover the fumble at its own 3. 
If the Vols had fallen on 
the ball, they very easily could 
have taken an early lead, ig-
nited the Neyland Stadium crowd and set the Gators up for a long, difﬁ  cult afternoon.   Given Muschamp and 
defensive coordinator Dan Quinn’s constant emphasis on winning the turnover battle, why are the Gators going out 
of their way to set up possible 
giveaways?
With Driskel, a mostly con-
servative passer, at the helm of an offense with a run-heavy 
approach, turnovers ﬁ  gure 
to be rare. Unless, of course, Florida puts itself in harm’s way.  
  Later that same quarter, 
on a fourth-and-1 at its own 40, Florida motioned from a spread punt formation to a three-man line with Burton 
under center. 
Only a timeout as the ball 
was snapped kept the Gators 
from certain failure. 
  These plays wouldn’t be a

terrible idea if Florida was strug-
gling or needed to rely on gim-micks. 
But the surprising truth is the 
Gators might actually be good. 
After upset wins in hostile envi-
ronments against Texas A&M and 
Tennessee in consecutive weeks, 
all the talk about a new breed of tougher Gators makes sense. 
Now it’s time to start play-call-
ing accordingly. 
No more 15-yard punts from 
Jeff Driskel like he had against Bowling Green. 
No more fake field goal pitches 
from holder John Crofoot to Trey Burton, like the one against Texas A&M. Sure, it worked, but is that the way Florida wants to set the tone on the game’s first offensive 
drive?
And no more lining up with 
only three players on the line and 
the rest split out wide for a sim-
ple point-after try, as Florida did 
following their first touchdown against the Aggies. Especially against a team like 
Kentucky this weekend — a group 
that might be worse than Bowling 
Green. 
The formula is simple. Line up, play physical, run the ball, win. 
As surprising as it is in light 
of last season, Florida can do just that and be fine.

The Gators’ rotation on 
defense worked wonders in 
Knoxville, Tenn. 
Ten different players re-
corded a tackle while play-
ing in the front seven.
UF also recorded a sea-
son-best seven quarterback hurries against UT and held the Volunteers to just 13 car -
ries for 16 rushing yards in 
the second half.
“It helped out a lot,” 
Hunter said of the rotation. 
“We’re fresh going into the 
second half, and I think I 
played like 30-something snaps, and that’s pretty low. I thought I actually played more, but it was only like 30 
snaps. I was fresh after the 
game and fresh now.”

Until the Gators return to 
full health in the front seven, they will have to live under Muschamp’s injury mantra: “Man down, man up.”

Kentucky coach Joker Phillips is not discussing his team’s lengthy losing streak 
against Florida during preparation for Saturday’s game. Last season, UK snapped a 26-game losing streak against Tennessee with a 10-7 win on Nov. 26.

Florida coach Will Muschamp reacts to a penalty during UF’s 37-20 
win against Tennessee at Neyland Stadium on Saturday.
Gators’ run-based offense presents 
different challenges for Wildcats
of first- and second-year players. The only 
games that [the underclassmen] realize is the 
one a couple of them played in last year and the one these true freshmen are about to play in.”
In order to break the streak, the Wildcats 
will have to slow down the Gators’ much-improved offense. 
Phillips is well aware of the added em-
phasis Florida has put on the running game this season.
“One of the things that they’re doing 
that’s different from two years straight, run-ning the football more,” Phillips said. “You can notice the difference in the run game. They have a fast, physical back.”
Phillips was referring to starting running 
back Mike Gillislee, who last year had six rushes for 84 yards in Florida’s 48-10 win at Kentucky, including a 60-yard touchdown run. 
However, all of his carries came after Flor -ida took a 31-point lead.
He is now the Gators’ featured back, and 
Phillips said Gillislee is finally getting a chance to show what he can do.
“He’s getting opportunities now,” Phil-
lips said. 
“He’s always been a really good back. He 
has more opportunities now with Rainey and Demps not being there, and this has given him an opportunity, and he’s taking advan-tage of it.”
Even though it will take a season-best ef-
fort from the Wildcats to break the streak, 
nose tackle Omar Hunter said the Gators 
aren’t letting the past results make them overconfident. 
Florida respects Kentucky’s fight.“They have nothing to lose,” Hunter said. 
“That’s the scary thing about this team. They have nothing to lose. Streak being 25 games, you know, they’re going to do whatever 
it takes to get a win. That’s the scary thing 
about this game.”

When redshirt senior Kat Wil-
liamson missed her first game on 
Sept. 9 with a right meniscus tear, 
junior Maggie Rodgers finally re-
turned from a left ankle sprain she suffered in the summer.
With Williamson, an All-Amer -
ican center back, still out indefi-nitely, the Gators have relied on Rodgers’ experience on the back line more than ever. 
Rodgers started at outside back in 16 contests in 2011 but has seen most of her minutes this year at 
center filling in for Williamson. 
“We’re asking her to do two 
things that are really hard,” coach 
Becky Burleigh said. “One is she’s come off an injury and … kind of 
jumps into these games. The other 
is that we’re putting her in a posi-tion that she’s played very spar -
ingly.”
This weekend, Rodgers logged 
145 minutes against Auburn and Kentucky, the majority of them at center back next to freshman Christen Westphal. 
“She did well for not playing 
that position especially,” Westphal said. “I didn’t second guess play-ing next to her. I felt really com -
fortable.” 
Rodgers played sparingly at 
center during the Gators’ 2012 spring schedule, so the position is not new to her. 
“I didn’t really think of it being 
a hard task,” she said.
This weekend, Rodgers saw 
more time on the field than sopho-
more Annie Bobbitt, a natural cen-
ter back. Bobbitt started 17 matches last year at center but saw 54 fewer minutes than Rodgers against the Wildcats and Tigers. 
Rodgers said she has seen her 
left ankle improve every day.
“It’s healed enough where I can 
play and stuff,” Rodgers said. “Ob-
viously, it’s still sore from using 
those muscles that haven’t been used in a while.”
Rodgers is expected to play 
center on Friday night at 7 when 
Florida (4-3-1, 1-1 Southeastern 
Conference) hosts Tennessee (6-1-2, 1-0-1 SEC).
“She’s going to be learning on 
the job,” Burleigh said. “She’s go-ing to get better and better as the season goes. That’s a big ask for her, and I think she’s handled it pretty well so far.”◗ FRESHMAN ENROLLED IN JANUARY.

When she was 17 years old, freshman 
Berkley Whaley decided to forego her final 
semester in high school in favor of workouts in Florida’s weight room. 
Whaley was enrolled in classes at UF and 
trained with coach Mary Wise and the vol-leyball team less than two months after sign-ing her national letter of intent to play for UF on Nov. 9. 
“Mary suggested, if I wanted, to come up 
a semester early,” Whaley said. “It would be a great opportunity to take advantage of the weight room, the adjustment to the actual college life and practices. It’s been beneficial 
in the aspect of playing with the other girls 
and getting a groove going with them.”
While in high school, Whaley was named 
The St. Petersburg Times’ Pinellas County Player of the Year as a sophomore. Along with fellow Gator Nikki O’Rourke, Whaley led the Pinellas Heat to a national runner-up finish at the 2010 AAU Nationals. Because Whaley adjusted to college life 
early, Wise started her in Florida’s season opener against FIU. Whaley led all fresh-men with 10 kills, three digs, 11 points and an ace. 
“Berkley has had some significant play-
ing time with the injury to Noami (Santos-
Lamb),” associate head coach Dave Boos 
said. “We’ve had the chance to have a lot of freshmen out there on the outsides. Berk-ley is a player that’s continued to develop, and she’s a very skilled ball-control player.”  
Although she played only one set on the road last weekend, Whaley has excelled in the O’Connell Center. Whaley ranks second behind Ziva Recek among true freshmen 
with 27 kills, five aces, four blocks, 11 digs 
and 34.5 points in her 12 sets at home.
“All it takes for a skilled ball control play-
er like Berkley is to come in and get the expe-rience at the college level,” Boos said. “It’s a very different game compared to high school and club, but she’s adapting really well and you can see every day she keeps getting bet-ter at it.”

For Isabelle Lendl and her 
four sisters, shopping was nev-
er an option.
“My parents’ worst fear 
was to have my sisters and me around the mall,” Lendl said. “Girls can get into a lot of trou-ble and my parents didn’t want that to happen. We had a rule that you had to pick a sport and do it.”
Lendl followed the path of 
her father, former World No. 1 tennis player Ivan Lendl,  by choosing tennis to occupy her time. Shortly after realizing the excessive amount of running the game required, Isabelle turned to a less adrenaline-packed sport: golf. 
“After playing tennis, I 
didn’t like the running,” Lendl said. “Afterwards, I’d go to the golf course in the afternoon with my father. Eventually I told him I wanted to go in the mornings as well. That’s how my passion for golf started.”
What started as a plan by 
Lendl’s parents to keep their daughters active eventually sparked a productive amateur career. 
In 2004, 12-year-old Lendl 
was the youngest player to qualify for the 2004 U.S. Wom-en’s Amateur Championship. In 2006, she earned three Amer -
ican Junior Golf tournament victories and was chosen as a member of the United States team in the 2006 Junior Tyder Cup, where she went 2-0 to help the U.S. earn a 6-6 tie.
Her success in competitive 
play came as no surprise.
Her father captured eight 
Grand Slam singles titles, including a historic victory against John McEnroe in the 1984 French Open. 
For Isabelle, her father’s fa-miliarity with the mental aspect of sports has played a major role throughout her career. 
“He’s more of a mental side 
that I can bounce things off,” Lendl said. “I can tell him if I feel nervous about something and ask him how he handled a situation when he felt nervous about it. He’s kind of like a built-in Google.”
Two of Isabelle’s sisters also 
played golf in the SEC. Marika Lendl, who played at UF, tal-lied a 74.17 stroke average dur -
ing her junior season, second-
lowest on the team. 
Isabelle’s 
younger sis-
ter, Daniela Lendl, is a sophomore at Alabama. She compet-ed against Florida in 
the Cougar Classic Sept. 9-11, carding a career-best 226 (+10) 54-hole total.
In her four-year career at 
Florida, Lendl has earned All-Southeastern Conference Sec-ond Team and SEC All-Fresh-man Team honors. 
She secured the first win of 
her Florida career on Tuesday , shooting a 210 (-6) at the Dale McNamara Invitational.  
Lendl hopes her two strong 
outings to open the season gen-erate momentum for the rest of the year.
“It’s nice to show myself 
that among the best teams in the country I can finish high,” Lendl said after posting a -4 to claim fifth place as part of Flor -
ida’s winning effort in the Cou-gar Classic. “I think winning a tournament, you always build confidence. It’s nice to have a win right out of the gate and show ourselves as a team that we can do it.” Lendl following in 
family’s footsteps

The Gators will face the top-
ranked passing offense in the South-
eastern Conference for a second consecutive week on Saturday . However, UF’s pass rush may be without defensive end Dominique Easley.
On Wednesday, coach Will Mus-
champ updated the condition of Ea-sley’s left knee, which was injured against Tennessee on Saturday. Ea-sley, who has swelling in his knee, has been using crutches this week.
“We’re just trying to stabilize,” 
Muschamp said. “He’s still got a little swelling on the knee. He’s moving around OK, but at this time I would say questionable for the game.”
Last season, Easley suffered an 
ACL tear in his left knee during Florida’s 21-7 loss to Florida State on Nov . 26. The injury limited him during fall camp, but he received clearance for contact this season and has started all three games, record-ing eight tackles, one sack and two quarterback hurries. 
If Easley cannot play against 
Kentucky , defensive coordinator Dan Quinn said either Earl Okine or Jonathan Bullard will start at defen-sive end.
While the Gators received some 
bad news on Easley’s knee, Will line-backer Jelani Jenkins could poten-tially return for UF’s game against LSU on Oct. 6. 
On Sept. 10, Jenkins underwent 
surgery to repair a broken right thumb he suffered against Texas A&M.On Wednesday , Jenkins lifted 
weights and ran for the first time since the injury, Muschamp said.“He went to the doctor and they 
changed his cast,” Muschamp said of Jenkins’ progress. “I want to say in eight days they’re going to pull a pin out of there and take another look at it.”While Easley and Jenkins will 
likely return to the lineup within a few weeks, prospects do not look as promising for offensive tackle Matt Patchan. Patchan (strained pectoral muscle) has not played since UF’s  loss to FSU last season. Saturday’s game against the Wildcats will be the 31st he has missed due to injury during his UF career.
“I’m not sure when Matt will be 
back,” Muschamp said.
Purifoy at wide receiver: The Gators 
want to get the ball in cornerback Loucheiz Purifoy’s hands. He is cur -
rently earning reps at wide receiver during practice and appeared at the position against Bowling Green and Texas A&M.
While Purifoy has played primar -
ily defense in his two seasons with UF, that was not the case when he was at Pensacola Pine Forest High.
“I barely played defense (in high 
school),” Purifoy said. “All I played was offense. So, hey , if I can get the chance to get the ball in my hand, help the team any way possible.”
Purifoy said Muschamp ap-
proached him about the possibility of playing wide receiver. Purifoy said that whenever he lines up on offense, it’s “like riding a bike.”
“[Muschamp] was just like, 
‘We’re going to try and get the ball in your hands on offense, so go work with coach (Brent) Pease,’” Purifoy said. “[Pease] was kidding around with me at first, saying he needed me just to help a little bit, and I was like, ‘I’m all in. Anything you need.’”
