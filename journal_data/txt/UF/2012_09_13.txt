According to Tritt’s resume on the law 
college’s website, Tritt came to UF in 2005. 
He started as an associate professor and 
has held many roles, including his current 
position as director of the Center for Estate Planning. 
Students voted Tritt “College of Law 
Professor of the Year” for three consecu-tive school years: 2009, 2010 and 2011.
In response to Monday’s incident, 
Bridget Siegel, president of Pride Student 
Union, said her organization will contact 
members of OUTLaw, the college’s gay-straight alliance group.Siegel said the incident is not to be tak-
en lightly.
“There are so many other ways to ex-
press yourself, and hatred isn’t something that should be necessary,” she said.
Police do not have a suspect, but Barber 
said officers will continue to look for the person responsible. 
“Our officers will vigorously investi-
gate this particular incident,” he said. “A 
hate crime is a very serious offense, and 
we treat it that way.”
Anyone with information about the 
incident should contact UPD at 352-392-1111.

BENGHAZI, Libya — The U.S. dispatched 
an elite group of Marines to Tripoli on Wednes-
day following a mob attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Ameri-cans. U.S. officials are investigating whether 
the violence — initially blamed on an anti-Is-
lamic video — was a terrorist attack planned to coincide with the anniversary of 9/11.
The one-story villa that serves as the con-
sulate was a burned-out wreck after the crowd armed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades rampaged through it. Slogans of “God is great” and “Muhammad is God’s Prophet” were scrawled across its scorched walls. 
Libyan civilians strolled freely in charred 
rooms with furniture and papers strewn every-where.
President Barack Obama vowed in a Rose 
Garden address that the U.S. would “work with the Libyan government to bring to justice” those who killed Ambassador Chris Stevens, information manager Sean Smith and two oth-er Americans who were not identified. Three 
other Americans were wounded.
Stevens was the first U.S. ambassador killed 
in the line of duty in 30 years.
“We reject all efforts to denigrate the reli-
gious beliefs of others, but there is absolutely no justification for this type of senseless vio-
lence. None,” said Obama, who also ordered increased security at U.S. diplomatic posts abroad.
The mob attack was initially presumed to 
have been a spontaneous act triggered by out-rage over a movie mocking Islam’s Prophet Muhammad that was produced in the U.S. and promoted by controversial Gainesville pastor Terry Jones. 
The video also drew protests in Cairo, where 
angry ultraconservatives climbed the U.S. Em-bassy’s walls, tore down an American flag and 
replaced it with an Islamic banner.
But a U.S. counterterrorism official said the 
Benghazi violence was “too coordinated or pro-
fessional” to be spontaneous. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the incident publicly.
The FBI was sending evidence teams to Lib-
ya, a law enforcement official said.
Libya’s new leadership — scrambling to 
preserve ties with Washington after U.S. help to overthrow former dictator Moammar Gad-hafi — vowed to find those behind the attack. Interim President Mohammed el-Megarif apol-ogized to the United States for what he called the “cowardly” assault, which also killed sev-eral Libyan security guards at the consulate in the eastern city.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 2012

PCBs cause cancer, acne, rashes
balls from a German bubble tea 
chain, including polychlorinat-ed biphenyls, or PCBs.
Keith Schneider, a UF food 
science and human nutrition 
associate professor, said PCBs 
have been linked to cancer and other ailments.
“It can cause some more 
acute symptoms like acne and rashes,” Schneider said. “And it can damage the liver over long time exposures, disrupt immune responses and cause 
fatigue.”
The tapioca balls tested by 
the hospital were shipped to 
Germany from Taiwan, which is one of the biggest suppliers of bubble tea’s tapioca.
Some have called into ques-
tion the legitimacy of the test, since the results don’t explain 
how the test was conducted or how much PCB the hospital 
staff found.
“It all depends on the levels 
that were found,” Schneider said. “There’s a certain number of PCB that’s allowed in your drinking water, granted it’s measured in parts for billion.”
The chemical hasn’t been ac-
tively used in the United States since the 1970s.
“People who worked on 
that had more lymphomas and other things,” Schneider said. “That’s when people started to take notice.”
Margaret James, a UF me-
dicinal chemistry professor, said traces of the substance remain in the environment be-cause PCB has a very long half-life.
“They’re very persistent,” 
James said. “That’s why they tend to be found in things with fatty material in them.”
She said most complaints 
about PCBs in food come from milk, which is used to make tapioca pudding, cheese and other dairy products.
Despite the hoopla, Rigby 
said she’ll still quench her thirst with the exotic drink.
“It wouldn’t affect me be-
cause it was in Germany ,” Rigby said. “I think you’d have to consume a ton of it to get an effect.”

15.7 percent still uninsured
parents’ plan while she attends medical 
school in Dominica.
Rodrigues is appreciative.“With the way the economy is, it’s 
hard to expect people right out of college to be able to pay for insurance,” she said.
While the amount of insured 19- to 25-
year-olds showed a 2.2 percent increase, other age groups did not show much im-provement. Many Affordable Care Act provisions that would change that have not yet been implemented.Still, 15.7 percent of Americans do not 
have insurance.
UF journalism senior Valeria Delgado, 
22, is among the 48.6 million Americans who remain uninsured. She said a lot of her friends are in the same situation.
Delgado has had strep throat 14 times. 
She would have gotten her tonsils re-moved when she was younger, but with neither parent insured, “we just couldn’t afford it.”
“I’m uninsured because I can’t afford 
it,” Delgado said. “With the new Health Care Act, it’s definitely something I’m looking into, but I don’t know how af-fordable it’ll actually be.”INsuRANcE ,

Self-proclaimed Apple fanatic Javi-
er Tirado-Montero spent Wednesday 
afternoon listening to a live stream as the company made its long-awaited and much-hyped announcement.
But his high expectations fell short.Apple announced the launch of its 
iPhone 5 at an event in San Francisco, confirming the swirling rumors of an iPhone upgrade. Apple also unveiled a new iPod nano, iPod touch and iOS 6 software.
Tirado-Montero, a proud owner of 
five Apple products, said he was dis-
appointed the iPhone 5 had no “wow 
feature.”
“It seemed as though this iPhone 
5 is just the standard upgrade that Apple always does every two years,” the 19-year-old marketing sophomore said in an email.
The updated features in the iPhone 
5 redesign include a longer, four-inch screen, different headphones and a smaller connector. The phone is also 18 percent thinner than the iPhone 4S, twice as fast and has an extended battery life capable of up to 10 hours on Wi-Fi, according to the company’s website.
Marcus Keyes, who works in the 
UF Bookstore’s computer section, said the store will carry all the new Apple products but the iPhone 5. Those must be purchased with a phone contract.
Still, Keyes said he’s sure the new 
iPhone will “sell like crazy.”
“Students are always wanting the 
newest technology,” he said.
The iPhone 5 will be sold starting at 
$199 for 16GB. It will be available for pre-order Friday and will be on sale Sept. 21.Students react to iPhone

University Police charged a 
60-year-old homeless man with 
stealing electronics from sev-eral cars on Sorority Row.
Police arrested Joseph Mur -
ray on felony charges of petty theft and car burglary early Wednesday morning.
Just after midnight Wednes-
day , a UPD officer responded to a call about a man seen near Sorority Row on West Panhel-lenic Drive, walking from car to car and pulling on door han-
dles, said UPD spokesman Maj. 
Brad Barber.
The officer spotted Mur -
ray on the 800 block of South-west 13th Street with a plastic grocery bag. Murray let police search his bag, and the officer found three GPS devices, cash and watches.
Barber praised the witness’ 
hasty call to police and the de-scription given.
“This is an excellent example 
of how important it is to quickly 
contact law 
enforcement and report suspicious 
behavior,” 
Barber said. “The infor -
mation we received was critical in 
making an identification and arrest of the suspect.”
Police booked Murray into 
Alachua County Jail at 3:21 a.m. Wednesday, where he re-mained with a $100,000 bond as of Wednesday night.

Gainesville residents will have another 
choice for grocery shopping this December.
Save-A-Lot, a discount grocery store, is set 
to open mid-December at 2302 SE Hawthorne 
Road in the building where a Food Lion store 
closed in February . 
Save-A-Lot, based in St. Louis, has more 
than 1,300 stores in 39 states. Save-A-Lot 
spokeswoman Chon Tomlin said the average shopper can save up to 40 percent on their groceries as compared to a traditional grocery store.“It’s a real easy way to save money and 
stretch that student budget,” Tomlin said.
Tomlin said the store model will be smaller 
than the former Food Lion store. The average Save-A-Lot store is 15,000 to 16,000 square feet, about a third of the size of a traditional grocery store, she said.
Tomlin said the average store employs 20 
to 25 people, and the majority work part-time. She said the store is open to hiring students.
Tomlin said that while many students look 
at a job at a grocery store as a temporary pay-check, students should look at Save-A-Lot as a potential career path.The new store will be about four miles 
away from the Reitz Union, which might be 
an inconvenience to student shoppers on a 
budget, said Mark Rush, UF microeconomics professor.
“Students are interested in saving a lot,” 
Rush said. “But students won’t go very much 
because it’s far away.”
However, he said the store’s cheap goods 
will fit Gainesville’s Eastside because of the 
number of low-income residents who live there.
“It’s appealing to residents in east 
Gainesville because they’re vastly under -
served,” Rush said.
Mugdha Palkar, a 26-year-old UF informa-
tion systems graduate student, is interested in seeing what kind of food Save-A-Lot has, as long as she can get there.
“If the bus goes there, then I will go there,” 
Palkar said.
Marissa Langford, an 18-year-old UF health 
science freshman, said she learned through her mother how to coupon, and she wants to see if she can get a good deal on fruits and veg-etables at the new Save-A-Lot.
“I like discounts, but I’ve never been there,” 
she said, “so it’d be good for me to check it out.”East Gainesville to welcome new discount grocery store

Fliering and campaigning for Student 
Government’s October elections may not 
have started yet, but the political parties are beginning the process.
The Swamp Party was on Turlington 
Plaza and the Reitz Union on Wednes-day seeking students’ input on which is-sues they want SG to address this year. 
Many students’ suggestions involved 
safety, security and transportation. Stu-dents wrote on the party’s whiteboards that they wanted more covered bus stops, better parking locations on cam-pus and more.
Psychology sophomore Alexia Per -
kins wanted more buses for routes 20 and 21 during the mornings and early evenings. The 19-year-old said reaching out to get students’ ideas is good be-cause it gives them a chance to express their views before campaigning begins.
“They’re looking at our opinions and 
saying they do care about us in a way,” Perkins said.
Swamp Party spokesman Daniel 
Landesberg said party leadership will look at every idea and decide which ones to place on their platform. He said they choose the ideas that are “most feasible and beneficial to the Student Body.”
Dave Bradshaw, the Students Party 
campaign manager, said his party will be outside today, Friday and the begin-ning of next week gathering ideas from students.
“We want to make sure we get as 
many good ideas as possible,” he said.

Chloe Shill went from living in the busy 
suburbs of Miami to the walkable streets of 
Gainesville.
“I feel fine here,” said the 20-year-old UF 
international studies junior. “People don’t stop 
for red lights in Miami. People stop here. It’s 
like a thing.”
On Monday, the city of Gainesville was 
awarded a Bronze-level award by Walk Friendly Communities, an organization that honors pedestrian-friendly U.S. cities. The or -
ganization is sponsored by the Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administra-tion.
The distinction is well below the top plati-
num ranking, but still leaves the city as one of only 33 certified in the U.S. with the honor.
Chip Skinner, spokesman for Gainesville 
Public Works, said the award showcases Gainesville’s commitment to public safety.
“There’s an application process where we list everything we’ve done this and previous years to make pedestrians safer and improve connectivity within the city,” Skinner said.  
He said partnering with the Gainesville 
Police Department last year helped improve crosswalk safety by reminding people they 
need to stop for pedestrians. 
Debbie Leistner, city public works transpor -
tation planning manager, said she’s happy to 
have Gainesville rated among the most walk-friendly communities in the state.
“We’re going to continue to look for ways 
to improve the system for all the citizens and users,” she said.

Wednesday’s poll results are unavailable 
due to a technical error. We are more than 
Terry Jones
We’re at a crossroads now.
As a nation, we’ve seen what we can build when 
we embrace other cultures, and we’ve seen what we 
can destroy when we accost them.
On Tuesday, 11 years after the U.S. was attacked by people 
who despised the American way of life, we felt that pain again 
when four American diplomats were killed after a consulate of-ﬁ  ce was attacked in Libya. This time, the light was shone back on Gainesville, if only for an instant.
The protesters were reportedly enraged by an anti-Moham-
mad video made by a California-based ﬁ  lmmaker. Another pro-test took place in Cairo, where thousands of people stormed the U.S. embassy.
At ﬁ  rst glance, the cartoon-ish video seems like it wouldn’t 
circulate too far from home. Except it had a backer — someone whose growing notoriety has given him an international audi-ence: Gainesville pastor Terry Jones.
He’s best known for his Quran-burning stunt two years ago 
when he planned, and then called off, an event to burn about 200 Islamic holy books.
Then, that March, he lit the pages, and the situation exploded. 
Word got to Afghanistan. People rioted and stormed into a U.N. compound. At least 12 people inside were killed.
It’s clear that he was a factor — even a small one — in Tues-
day’s riots that left four Americans dead.
He didn’t pull the trigger. He didn’t push down the door. He 
didn’t have to. He fanned the ﬂ  ame, and that was enough.
It is unacceptable for another American to incite deliberate 
religious hatred toward another religion. It is unacceptable to tour the country spreading only hurt, dragging Gainesville’s name in the mud as you go.
Terry Jones does not deﬁ  ne Gainesville. We are better than 
that.
Leaders, students and residents gathered in peace on Sept. 11 
to prove we’re better and to forget Jones’ message.
After he called off his ﬁ  rst burning day, editors and staff at 
the Alligator decided we were done covering Jones. 
It took 12 deaths for us to publish his name again.Jones may have the First Amendment right to say whatever 
he pleases, but that right only exists if it is not used to harm peo-ple. He doesn’t care if the ends justify the means; he only cares 
about rufﬂ  ing feathers.
But he doesn’t matter today.
What matters are the people who died in the attacks. They 
remind us that our world is in turmoil and true peace is a distant dream.
And what matters most are the Libyan people who have 
shown their disagreement with those responsible for the at-tacks.
We appreciate their apology , and we’d like to issue our 
own.
We’re sorry that any of this violence occurred in the ﬁ  rst 
place. We’re sorry that Americans abroad and at home might feel targeted, victimized or scared.
Peace may be on the far horizon, but we’re a generation of 
dreamers. Let’s go forward wisely.‘What Not to Wear:’ Freshman edition

as terrible as many might think. Anyone else who has started their mornings by donning a plaid skirt or oxford blouse may not be completely in agreement, but overall uniforms have been a great part of my childhood. 
I never had to second guess what I would wear the 
next day. And I like to think that it saved me money through high school because I didn’t need quite as many outﬁ  ts, but in reality that would probably be a lie. 
So now, at 18 years of age and a college freshman, I 
am facing the problem that many had to answer years ago: What do I wear to school?
It’s a legitimate problem, as I’ve never had to consider 
it before. But from what I have observed, the attire really depends on the person. 
Many people are perfectly happy sporting gym 
clothes at all hours of the day. Whatever is easiest to slip into immediately after the alarm clock buzzes is the day’s outﬁ  t. 
But others are not content with this style. Class to 
some is a place to be seen, where makeup and a decent outﬁ  t are required.  Mainly this is embodied by females, but I have spotted many guys sporting collared shirts and khakis — the typical prep look. 
But when I look into my closet every morning, I still 
don’t know what to wear. I have done my observation, but still have yet to ﬁ  nd my daily style category. 
This is one of college’s greatest objectives; students 
must learn to think for themselves. Clothing is not the only decision I have to make daily. There are more ob-stacles to hurdle and many opportunities to take the easy way out. Many professors don’t take attendance, and no one would notice if I slept all day, never venturing be-yond my room.  
University life is ﬁ  lled with choices, and the answers add up to equal a personal col-lege experience.  
In years earlier, I have always 
relied on some form of guide-lines on everything  from how to dress, where to be at an exact time and so forth. But now, left to my own choice, the pressure that accompanies the personal freedom is overwhelming. 
Until the day I left my hometown and moved to 
Gainesville, the world seemed a lot smaller. 
And a lot easier. This is true with many other concepts that early edu-
cation, especially private school, has instilled in me. 
Growing up, many topics were hushed. Issues such as 
drug use, gay marriage and teenage pregnancy were not socially acceptable, so teachers steered clear of them. The same goes with curse words or any sexual remarks. 
The adults I grew up with brushed unclean topics un-
der the carpet and kept them there. 
College takes that carpet and shakes it out. All the 
dust once collected underneath  comes to life and is dis-cussed in and out of the classroom.
In college, some of the hardest tests don’t come in an 
exam format. 
One of the greatest is what to do with 24 hours in 
a day. Maximizing time and getting the most that this campus has to offer for four years takes a strong com-mitment.  
Learning to think for myself and forming my own 
personal opinions takes the same amount of brain power as studying for a chemistry exam. 
But for now, I just need to decide what I am going to 
wear tomorrow.

Chivalry is dead, but it’s not gone forever.
Usually this phrase comes from the mouth of 
nagging women. Speaking from the perspective 
of one such woman, I can attest to the fact that men don’t 
appreciate women enough. I have engaged in countless 
conversations with my female friends about how pig-
headed, disrespectful and downright disgusting some of the men we have encountered can be.
But then I got to thinking, where exactly did this stan-
dard come from that we are comparing those men’s ac-tions to?
I think I may have finally nailed the culprit who has 
caused all women to believe the entire male population is corrupt and will never be chivalrous enough for our 
standards. That devious culprit is Walt Disney himself, 
and all his animated magical tales he and his studio have produced into movies.
It is every girl’s dream to be a princess.We grow up hearing stories of fairy tales like Cin-
derella, Sleeping Beauty and Snow White, where Prince Charming arrives on some kind of glistening animal, all muscular and probably not wearing a shirt, and then proceeds to gracefully hoist the damsel in distress out of 
danger, without the prince even breaking a sweat, and 
still has the energy to express every ounce of love he has been building up inside himself for the princess.
He then promises her all the riches of his kingdom, 
including luxurious life in a castle, and all she has to do is just slip on one stupid glass slipper.
See the problem yet? From the 
time girls can walk, we are put-ting these standards of what men 
should be in their heads.
These fantasies are setting up 
all men who will enter their lives 
for failure. Girls, it’s time we evaluate our Disney-influ-
enced standards and bring them out of the animation world and back to the reality we live in.
Now to the men out there, this isn’t an excuse for 
you to give up on chivalry. But it’s time we all come to a compromise about what women can live without, like 
a white stallion and a castle full of gold, and what we 
still deserve from you: respect, honesty and being true to yourself.
Listen up, boys: I’m going to share some helpful tips 
that will help you become appreciated once again by the female population.
It may sound simple, and I know all guys have heard 
this a thousand times, but hold doors open for the ladies walking behind you. We eat that stuff up. And when you 
open that door, look at them, smile and say hello.
These may seem like small gestures, but they will 
stay with that girl all day.
Another way to win over the tough man-eater crowd 
is to act like you care. About everything. Start a con-
versation. You’ve then provoked her to think about the couple of things you had the nerve to say to before class started, and if she’s interested, she will have thought of something to say by the time class is over.
Pay attention to the details. What is she wearing? 
If you don’t know much about fashion, keep it simple. Say you like her shirt, pants, hair, etc. It’s not creepy; it doesn’t make you any less manly because you noticed her clothes, and it will take you up at least three rungs on the “we hate men” ladder.
Finally, be yourself. Don’t negotiate who you are at 
the core just to fit the standards of a girl. I’m talking about your personality, your hobbies, the things you’re passionate about; stay true to those.
The bottom line is there are a lot of girls out there, and 
we’re all looking for the men who share our same inter -
ests as well, but we want them to be genuine. Don’t try to fake it, and you’ll be much happier in the long run.
Ladies, it’s time to drop the Disney princess fantasies 
and come back to reality. Prince Charming can’t be all he’s cracked up to be anyway; I’m sure the horses, mus-cles and gold would become annoying eventually.
Guys, put in a little extra effort; stay true to yourself, 
and girls will quit complaining that you’re all worth-less.

Last month, the national unem-
ployment rate fell to 8.1 percent. Given that the unemployment 
rate peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, the economy must have im-
proved significantly during the last 
three years, right?
Actually, no. The unemployment 
rate in isolation can be misleading.
During the last four years, many 
unemployed workers have grown dis-couraged and simply stopped looking for work. These people are no longer counted as part of the labor force or as 
“unemployed.”
In January 2008, the Congressio-
nal Budget Office estimated that there 
would be 5 million to 6 million more individuals in the labor force today than is actually the case. If we calcu-late a “true” unemployment rate that includes these discouraged job seek-ers, the unemployment rate would 
have surpassed 11 percent in fall 2009 
and would have remained between 11 and 12 percent ever since.
Thus, contrary to what the official 
unemployment rate seems to indicate, the job market has not substantially improved during the last three years.
Alternatively, consider the percent-
age of working-age Americans who 
are working.
The employment-to-population ratio fell from 62.7 percent when the 
recession started in December 2007 to 59.4 percent when the recession ended in June 2009. It is now 58.3 percent. In other words, the economy hasn’t been 
creating enough jobs to keep up with 
population growth, let alone enough jobs to start reducing unemployment in any meaningful way.
But unemployment is not the only 
harm caused by the economic malaise. The crisis has also reduced Americans’ incomes.
From 1965 to 2007, the United 
States’ real gross domestic product grew at an average rate of 3 percent a year. After every recession since the end of World War II, GDP grew faster than the previous trend rates, as GDP converged to its previous trend. How-ever, since the end of the most recent recession, GDP growth has averaged only 2.4 percent per year. Thus, the 
average American’s income is now 
about 14.5 percent lower than it would be if GDP had converged with its pre-vious trend throughout the last three years.
When confronted with these facts, 
many people will attempt to excuse this abysmal economic performance in one of two ways: First, the recession 
was deeper than was initially believed 
in early 2009. Second, the recession was due to a financial cri-sis.
However, 
neither of 
these facts im-
plies that we should expect such a dis-
appointing recovery. Throughout the last two centuries, the American eco-nomic record has been quite consistent — the deeper the recession, the faster the recovery. Since the GDP dropped during the recession by more than was initially estimated, we should be 
seeing faster than expected economic 
growth now — not slower.
As a result, some economists have 
hypothesized that sclerotic recover -
ies are not caused by financial crises per se, but rather by bad government policies that have been adopted in the wake of certain financial crises.
If you, like I, do not wish to become 
a newly unemployed college graduate any time soon, then you will likely have to spend more time and effort looking for a job than would have been the case even five or six years ago.
So, don’t let an OK-looking unem-
ployment rate fool you. Unless some-thing changes soon, the economy will still suck by the time I graduate.

Teachers from Chicago public schools hit the streets to 
strike Monday . It’s the first time they ‘ve gone on strike in 25 years, and union leaders are butting heads with 
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel over a number of issues.
In fact, they’re crying foul on such a variety of issues that 
many are saying the general public doesn’t fully understand why they’re on strike.
Teaching is a profession I respect above all others. It’s one 
of the toughest jobs around, the pay is low and it’s some-times thankless. It’s remarkable that many teachers dedicate their lives to advancing students into brighter futures.
These beliefs lead me to believe that there is merit behind this strike, but I am not exactly sure what that is just yet.
To win this battle, CPS teachers 
must better organize, engage and convince the public that what they 
are doing is legitimate. They must narrow in on issues most important to them. Finally, they must walk, but never cross, the fine line between seeking fairness and pushing greed.
Any movement that displaces 350,000 Chicago children 
from the classroom must have this merit.

Xylitone can’t stop playing mu-
sic. Even as each member tells his 
story during a Friday night rehears-al, the other members strum popular songs on guitar, improvise melodies 
on piano keys or thumb strings on 
an electric bass.
The band, made up of two UF 
students and one UF graduate, has a show tonight at High Dive and was contacted by RUB Entertainment to open for of Montreal Sept. 25.
Lead vocalist, rhythm guitar -
ist and songwriter Tepu Khan and 
bassist Brent Billington met through 
The Staff, UF’s all-male A Cap-pella group. Khan met keyboardist Bryant Nguyen through a mutual friend, and the trio formed Xylitone in August 2011.
The band is primarily alternative 
rock, Khan said, but the range of musical backgrounds each member 
brings creates a lot of “ambient in-
fluences.”
Khan, a 20-year-old anthropolo-
gy student, calls himself the dream-er of the group. He speaks with his hands, gesturing through his life as a musician, which includes singing since the age of 4, starting guitar in sixth grade and being in and out of bands throughout high school.
He didn’t start songwriting until 
he got to college, but it’s his favorite 
part now, he said.
“I feel privileged to channel emo-
tion and inspiration into songs,” he 
said. “I pick up my guitar and it just comes to me.”
Slapping the strings of an electric 
blue bass next to Khan is Billington, a civil engineering alumnus and self-proclaimed realist of the group who 
brings an entire spectrum of instru-
ment experience to Xylitone.
Billington, 24, learned to play pi-
ano by ear at a young age and took the skill all the way to high school jazz band, where he became a first-chair saxophonist. In college, he and his roommates 
formed a joke band called Jakit, where he picked up bass.
Throughout his musical evo-
lution, Billington has sustained a knack for wind instruments.
“When it comes to penny flutes, I 
am a god,” he said.
As Billington spoke, Nguyen, a 
21-year-old architecture major, qui-
etly played fragments of jazzy songs 
on a mahogany-colored keyboard, a setting suitable for a candlelit din-ner.
He is considered by his band-mates the glue of the trio, holding everything together with the techni-cal nature he gained from 12 years of classical piano training. Jazz also in-
fluences Nguyen’s playing, he said, 
which infiltrates the band’s overall sound.
Although a record label hasn’t 
signed the group yet, Xylitone has built a Gainesville fan base, playing in local venues during the past year. 
The show tonight, which begins 
at 9 p.m., is exciting because two 
other local bands are opening for 
Xylitone rather than the other way around. 
Opening for of Montreal is excit-
ing as well, according to Khan. The event, which has almost 700 attend-
ees on Facebook, will expose a huge 
audience to Xylitone.
“That is the biggest opportu-
nity that’s come our way so far,” Khan said. “We would have never thought we would open for a legiti-mate recording artist.”
The band also has an EP called 
“Live to be Lost” and a subsequent 
single, “Reinvent,” both available on 
Spotify and iTunesUsually Khan writes a song’s 
skeleton, which consists of the lyr -
ics and chord progressions. The band is a democracy , Khan said, so 
if Billington and Nguyen don’t like 
a potential song, they don’t go for -
ward with it. However, if approved, the members write their instrument parts over the basic outline, and the chords become a song.
Sometimes, writing doesn’t hap-
pen in such a controlled manner.
“Reinvent” was born in the stu-
dio when the song the band was originally recording wasn’t work-ing, Khan said.
Regardless, the band members 
agree the transition from rough out-line to finished product is always a privilege.
“When we hear the difference be-
tween the rough recording that Tepu 
would make and give us to listen to 
and what the final product is, it’s quite a leap,” Nguyen said. “I love hearing that.”
The trio has 
accomplished a lot in a year, but Khan said they’ll never become 
complacent.
“This band is 
all about getting 
better,” he said, a motivation that is 
fueled by the strong bond that exists between members. “These two guys 
are my best friends.”
And that connection is apparent. 
When the band was rehearsing “Far 
Away ,” a song written by Nguyen, Billington played the exact bass line Khan heard in his head.
“This is how we know when we 
finally click,” he said. “It’s like Wi-Fi.”
They continued playing, Billing-
ton closing his eyes, Nguyen lean-ing in and out of the keys and Khan tilting his head toward the ceiling, singing out.
“This is what we want to do,” 
Khan said. “Live life making music. That’s the dream.”

When President Barack Obama told an 
Iowa man about his White House-brewed 
beer stash aboard his tour bus, he piqued the 
interests of citizens across America — 25,000 
to be exact. That’s the amount of signatures needed on a “We the People” petition submit-ted under the Freedom of Information Act by 
a determined Reddit user.White House Press Secretary , Jay Carney , 
promised that when America hit the magic 
number, the recipes would become available to the public. 
However, when the petition had more than 
12,000 signatures on Sept. 1, the White House formally released a blog entry titled “Ale to the Chief,” which contains recipes for White House Honey Ale and White House Honey Porter.
“With public excitement about White House beer fermenting such a buzz, we de-cided we better hop right to it,” said Sam Kass, 
writer of the blog and the White House assistant 
chef and senior policy 
adviser for Healthy Food 
Initiatives.
Both beers are brewed 
with White House hon-ey , tapped from the first 
White House beehive on the South Lawn.  The White House Honey Ale 
is the also the first known alcohol to be brewed or distilled on White House grounds.
Internet home brew supply shop North-
ern Brewer has launched two kits that include 
all the necessary ingredients for each White 
House beer. The Honey Ale retails for $39.75 and the Honey Porter for $31.75.
The ingredients and recipe for both brews 
can be found on www.whitehouse.gov/blog.

The pre-, mid- and post-Olympics 
news coverage may have subsided, but 
lucky for Gainesville residents, Ryan Lochte can still be a part of our daily lives. Here’s a drinking game to celebrate.
#LochteNationIf you’re pregaming on a time crunch, 
you should probably go straight to his Twitter feed and drink every time you see: #jeah and you’d rather see #yolo, a des-perate plea for a retweet from a 20-some-thing female, any instance of shameless promotion for a product he might have gotten for free and any instance of shame-
less promotion for a Ryan Lochte sig-
nature product (for example: the highly anticipated “Lochte Hardcore” workout video — now available for pre-order). Enjoy your night out, and I’m sorry in advance if you roll over the next morning and see three Doritos Locos Tacos wrap-pers on your bedroom floor — remember your “real self” wouldn’t make that deci-
sion, so it doesn’t count.
The Grill
It’s platinum, bears a slight resem-
blance to our flag and can often be found in Ryan Lochte’s mouth. If you see some-thing gleaming near his head and it’s not a medal, it’s probably his grill, and you need to drink. Whether you see it in a picture, in real life or in your mind’s eye, grab a drink and grin while you chug. You have to keep grinning as you’re chugging. 
SPOTTED
Our boy likes to party, and UF stu-
dents love to document it with their smartphones. Your Facebook news feed is probably more than familiar with blurry mobile uploads of your friend sweating next to Ryan Lochte. Drink for however many “likes” the picture gets.
Be Your Own OlympianGrab your pal Michael (everybody 
knows at least one 
Michael) and start drinking bottles of beer. The first person to reach 11 (Lochte’s medal count) wins, and the loser has to turn the winner’s beer bottle caps into 
11 individual neck-
laces — now you can feel like an Olym-
pian too.
Real-Life EncounterIf you’re lucky enough to see him in 
real life, you have one simple task: drink enough truth serum to walk up and con-fess to him — regardless if you’re a dude 
or a chick— that you’ve been crush-
ing on him since Athens. It may not be your opinion, but it’s the general con-sensus of the world. Be a global Gator. #LochteWorld� THE STORE IS LOCATED AT 
1127 W. UNIVERSITY AVE.

Sifting through clothing racks 
and sipping on cocktails, Gainesville 
fashionistas enjoyed a sale at Wolf-gang boutique Friday , in honor of the store’s five-year anniversary.
Wolfgang, located at 1127 W. 
University Ave., offered a grab-bag sale to all customers who visited the store, with a chance to receive dis-counts of up to 50 percent off any one item, in addition to  15 percent-off the entire shop.
Cocktails were provided by 
2nd Street Speakeasy bar, where 
Wolfgang owner Matthew Turner 
bartends during the week. Drinks ranged from beer and wine to vod-ka- or gin-based drinks.
College girls sipped on a water -
melon punch with mint and vodka — a signature drink Turner, 30, said he toyed with at Speakeasy for the event.
Also in honor of the event, Turner 
and his employees created a 22-song fall mix with indie and electro-in-spired tracks. The staff burned cop-ies of the mix that shoppers could take with them for free.
“I love doing customer apprecia-
tion nights like these,” Turner said. “There’s no better way to celebrate 
our five years in business than treat-
ing our customers to something spe-
cial.”
Sheer blouses, vibrant jewelry 
and colorful pants filled the mod-
ern boutique — and not just on the racks. Wolfgang’s trendy style was apparent on the fashion-forward girls who attended the event, like Leanne Yarn, a 23-year-old interior design senior.
“I was interning in New York 
City this summer, and a lot of the clothes in this store remind me of 
what the professional women and 
young girls wore in the city ,” Yarn 
said. “The clothing is just very trendy and perfect for college girls 
here in Gainesville.”
For Natalia Silva, a 22-year-old 
interior design senior, Wolfgang 
provides a unique style that suits her individuality.
“Not everyone is going to have 
the same dress or shirt, which you would see a lot when shopping at stores in the mall,” Silva said. “The clothing is very fresh and up-to-date, which is hard to find in many brand name stores.”
Wolfgang provides a wide vari-
ety of brand clothing, ranging from 
BB Dakota and Dolce Vita to local 
fashion brands like Off White Ap-parel, the urban-style clothing line designed by 20-year-old journalism junior Darshay Davis.
“I design a lot of cut-off shorts 
and tank tops with an urban appeal,” Davis said. “Cut-off shorts are really hot right now, so networking with 
Wolfgang provided the store with 
some custom, one-of-a-kind shorts that city girls will appreciate.”
Wolfgang’s location within walk-
ing distance to UF and sorority row has proved vital to the store’s suc-cess.
In addition to the location, Turn-
er’s decision to modify the store helped it survive the economic breakdown.
“The success of the business has come through trial and error. We started out with both men and women’s clothing and carrying the higher-end labels such as Marc by Marc Jacobs,” Turner said. “Then the economy crashed, and people were tightening up their spending, so we 
had to reinvent ourselves.”
After the store’s first year in busi-
ness, Turner preordered more cloth-
ing, thinking he would do more 
business in his second year, he said. The economy faltered, and the store 
brought in less business than ex-pected, leaving Turner with excess inventory, he said.
“Bills came piling up, and pay-
roll was getting tight. It was a fi-nancial nightmare,” he said. “I was 
wondering whether I was going to 
have enough money to pay my em-
ployees and even myself.”
Turner thought fast and acted 
quickly , deciding to get rid of the men’s clothing and become a full women’s boutique. He stopped selling expensive brand names and found clothing brands with the same unique style but for much less and with much more merit, he said.
“Almost every single store that 
was here when I opened is gone 
now,” he said. “Things got better, 
we’ve really found our niche on what works. And now, five years lat-
er, I’m still here.”THURSDAY , SEPTEMBER 13, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 9

As the beach-blond family sprawls out 
and discusses play and politics in its South-
ern Californian home, one could easily con-fuse the Wyeths with Hollywood royalty like the Kennedys or Kardashians.  And like other 
high-profile clans, the Wyeths have a cache 
of secrets too. Secrets that threaten to expose decades-old traumas and irrevocably change this family forever.
Gainesville’s Hippodrome Theatre has pro-
duced cutting-edge plays throughout its 40 years. It’s latest production, “Other Desert Cit-ies,” is no exception.
Set in sunny , swanky Palm Springs, Calif., 
“Other Desert Cities” follows a recent Wyeth family Christmas gathering. What starts as common pleasantries and witty banter be-tween a mother, father and their two children soon transcends into a full-blown war when word gets out about a tell-all memoir. “Other Desert Cities,” by Jon Robin Baitz, premiered on Broadway in 2011 and won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress (Judith Light) and the 
Drama League Award for Best New Play.
Laughter soon developed into audible 
gasps during the past weekend’s production 
of “Other Desert Cities.” Directed to perfection by Tim Altmeyer, each actor created a com-pletely nuanced character overabundant in comical idiosyncrasies and dark skeletons.
As depressed writer/daughter Brooke Wy-
eth, Michelle Bellaver was truly a force to be 
reckoned with, capturing both the fragility and 
fierceness that accompany mental illness. Sara Morsey and Peter Thomasson depicted dy-namic duo Polly and Lyman Wyeth with great 
conviction and emotional believability.
Embodying many of the more light-hearted 
moments of the show were Matthew Lindsay 
and Lauren Caldwell. Lindsay , as son Tripp, personified the carefree attitude often associ-ated with Californian surfers while displaying emotional growth as tensions between his sis-ter and parents rose. Resident artistic director of the Hippodrome Theatre, Caldwell stood 
center stage in this show as Silda Grauman, 
bringing humor and honesty to the alcoholic aunt who wreaks havoc in the Wyeth home.
Act 1 was filled with biting one-liners and 
characters constantly one-upping each other to achieve the audience’s laughter, 
while Act 2 exploded with 
emotional confrontations as secrets came to light. Despite interruptions by audience chatter and cellphone ring-ing, a tense air enveloped 
the theatre as familial conflicts reached increas-ing heights in each successive scene.
Under the direction of stage manager Lara 
Maerz, “Other Desert Cities” ran without a hitch. Mihai Ciupe’s scenic design brought the arid look of California to Gainesville with des-ert tones, striking columns and a floor fire pit.
Hilarious, riveting and utterly entertaining, 
“Other Desert Cities” is a contemporary play that cannot be missed. “Other Desert Cities” will continue its run at the Hippodrome The-atre until Sept. 23.Hippodrome play is a must-seetheater Michelle Provenzano / Alligator

Dear Mediocre Advice,
How does a mediocre guy approach/
ask out a girl who is not so mediocre? 
–Mediocre AmericaDear Mediocre Advice,
I have a “friend” who I like to get naked with every once in a while. Lately, he’s 
been getting really needy — asking 
me to hang out all the time and getting pissy if I can’t. How do I make him un -
derstand that he’s just my benchwarmer 
guy, not my main squeeze?
Dear friend,
He likes you more than you like him. There is no point to beat around the bush if he’s not your main squeeze. Be straight with the poor guy. Tell him you enjoy his company, but you have bigger and better things to mount.Dear Mediocre Advice,Ello Ursula, there’s this girl that I’ve been seeing. We do the sexy time al-most every time we hang. My problem is that she likes to tease (for hours) giving me oral, which is what I like best. I’m very hygienic, so it’s not that. What 
is her dealio?
Dear person,
I’m assuming you’re wondering why she 
hasn’t let you enter her. The “dealio” is that 
she’s giving you oral for hours, and I don’t 
see what you are bringing to the table. You 
better be going down to vagina town twice as often, or the sexy time is not going to 
last much longer.
Ariel Barnes
Dear Mediocre America,
Grow a pair! Just ask her to hang out, or 
invite her to a bar with your friends. You should get to know her better to avoid being stuck with deal-breaking flaws. For example, she needs to hold your hand while eating or her laughter sounds 
like a slaughterhouse for farm animals. 
If she makes the cut, ask her on a real 
date and see where it goes.ASHIRA MORRIS

Matt Hires began his musical 
career as a teenager in Tampa, 
playing songs for his family at 
Christmas and turning a get-to-
gether at his brother’s house in St. Augustine into an impromptu house show.
On Friday, Hires will bring 
his singer/songwriter act to High Dive. The show starts at 9 p.m. with local opening acts Benny 
Cannon and Vane.
Hires, 27, played on the same 
Gainesville stage during his na-
tional tour in 2010, when the ven-
ue was called Common Grounds.
Since then, Hires has been off 
the road working on his unnamed 
sophomore album, which will be released within the next year.
Friday’s concert is part of a 
mini tour around his home state of Florida, which also includes stops in Tallahassee and Orlan-
do.
The set list includes songs off 
of the new record that have never 
been played live.
In comparison to his first al-
bum from 2009, “Take Us to the 
Start,” Hires wanted more of a 
pop/rock sound, more of an edge and more honesty in the new CD.
He said he feels like he 
achieved that.
In 2008, Hires signed with 
Atlantic Records and became the first act on F-Stop Music, a smaller label under Atlantic’s 
larger umbrella. He was discov-
ered when Gregg Nadel, one of Atlantic’s executives, heard Hires playing “Honey, Let Me Sing You a Song” on one of his 
MySpace videos. Since then, the 
song has been used on multiple soundtracks including the movie “When In Rome” and ABC’s TV 
show “Cougar Town.”
Hires describes his music as 
“pop/rock with a singer/song-
writer heart.” He draws inspira-tion from Tom Petty, Bob Dylan 
and The Killers.
In middle school, he saw his 
first concert, Dashboard Confes-
sional and Saves the Day. Dash-
board Confessional’s “honest and 
angsty” lyrics inspired his own songwriting, and led him to more classic artists. 
His guilty-pleasure listening is 
Taylor Swift’s most recent chart-topper “We are Never Ever Get-ting Back Together.”
In addition to guitar and vo-cal talent, Hires also plays bass, banjo and harmonica and can “noodle around” on the piano.
His goals for the future are ambitious.  He says he is aiming for world domination — by mu-sic, of course.
Tickets for Friday’s show can be purchased at www.highdivegville.com for $10 in advance or $12 on the day of show, with a $2 charge at the door for fans under 21.MARISA ROSS

UF does not have the high-
est-rated or hottest professors 
in the country.
When www.RateMyProfes-
sors.com released its annual  
rankings last month, UF did 
not claim a spot on the Top 25 Professors, Top 10 Hottest Pro-fessors or Top 25 Universities lists.
Amber Riccinto, a 20-year-
old journalism junior, said it was interesting that a school with about 50,000 students 
failed to make the list.
“Since we have such a high 
caliber of teachers, we might be 
more critical,” she said.   
Although the website al-
lows students to rate their professors on clarity, helpful-ness, easiness and rater inter -
est (“hot” teachers get a chili 
pepper next to their names) for 
an overall rating, the only two criteria considered for highest-rated professors were clarity and helpfulness.    
According to the site’s UF 
page, the average professor re-ceived a 3.82 rating on a scale of 5.0. 
Mark Rush, economics, re-
ceived the most ratings: 387. Amanda Reynolds, English; Laurie Taylor, English; and Kathy Zambrana, criminology; received the best overall qual-ity with 11 rankings each of 5.0. Todd Palmer, biology, is con-sidered UF’s hottest professor, with 46 total rankings and com-ments such as “Don’t forget to bring your fire extinguisher be-
cause this man is HOT.”
Last spring, the Princeton 
Review partnered with Rate 
My Professors to release its Best 300 Professors list. Three notable UF professors made the list: Steven Noll, history; Sergei Shabanov , mathematics; and Mike Foley, journalism.
Foley said he has read each 
of his own ratings and r e v i e w s . He finds some to be terrific and appreciates s t u d e n t 
feedback, but said 
that ratings vary .  
“It’s not science,” he said.  
“It’s not going out and con-ducting a scientific survey or poll with a margin of error of ‘x’ percent.”
Riccinto agreed and said the 
rankings aren’t the only aspect that should be considered.
“You have to take all that 
with a grain of salt,” she said.  
“Everyone has their own 
opinion.”12, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 2012

LOCATED AT 530 N. MAIN ST.
MEGHAN PRYCE
Alligator Contributing Writer
When it comes to yoga, flexibil-
ity helps — both in practice and in 
a change of location.
Sanctuary Yoga, previously 
located at the Seagle Building on 
University Avenue, has moved 
downtown, now located at 530 N. Main St.
The studio has moved locations 
a total of three times during its 10 years of business.
The first location was at a church 
building, which Melissa Montilla, owner of Sanctuary Yoga, said was 
too big. Later, the business moved 
to the Seagle Building, which she said was not big enough.
“I feel like Goldilocks,” Mon-
tilla said, laughing.
At the new location, Montilla 
found a space that is just right.
“I’m super excited about down-
town and the growth that I see,” she said. “It’s very promising.”
Amanda Culp has attended 
yoga classes at Sanctuary Yoga for the past eight years and supports 
the new location.
“It’s good, more convenient for me,” Culp said. “It’s right in the heart of things.” 
Keri Johnson, a yoga teacher at 
the studio, said she is most looking 
forward to the “continued sense of community for yoga participants and practitioners.”
Along with the new location, 
the yoga studio is offering new programs. These classes include 
yoga for runners and a balancing 
workshop. 
Montilla said Sanctuary Yoga 
will have the same busy schedule as in its previous location but with an increased number of work-shops.

Living rooms across the nation will fill with laughter 
this week, now that Matthew Perry has returned to the 
small screen in “Go On.”
Perry plays Ryan King, a sportscaster who must at-
tend grief counseling after losing his wife. 
Based on this character description alone, you would 
assume the show is a tearful drama. However, a closer look at the other therapy patients reveals the show’s co-medic undertones.
Other cast members include Tyler James Williams 
from “Everybody Hates Chris,” Julie White from the “Transformers” series, Peter Gelman from Adult Swim’s “Eagleheart,” John Cho from the “American Pie” and “Harold and Kumar” franchises and a number of other actors with hilarious roles on their resume.
The ensemble casting was a smart 
move for Perry’s return, considering it is a style he thrives in.
While the show does have its 
funny moments, I don’t see it thriv-ing. 
If it makes it through its first sea-
son, I would guarantee that it’s only because viewers are trickling over 
from “The Voice,” which airs just beforehand. 
You can catch Perry in his new show “Go On” Tues-
days at 9 p.m. on NBC.Matthew Perry returns to TV in ‘Go On’“I feel like Goldilocks.”

Poll Question
How many times will the Florida defense sack Tennessee quarterback 
Tyler Bray on Saturday? Vote online at alligatorSports.org.
Maddy Monserez has been 
thriving defensively for Florida since moving from middle back to right back on Friday. See story, page 19.   JOSH JURNOVOY 
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  Florida’s biggest strength in 2011, its 
defense, had just one glaring weakness: 
forcing turnovers. 
Through two games this season, the is-
sue persists, and the Gators are well aware of it.
  “This whole offseason, the beginning of 
the offseason, all the coaches been talking about was defense creating turnovers,” redshirt senior defensive tackle Omar Hunter said. “We deﬁ  nitely need to get our hands on more balls with intercep-
tions, sacks, caused fumbles. We deﬁ  nitely 
need to create more turnovers.”
  Sophomore cornerback Marcus Rober-
son’s interception in UF’s opener against 
Bowling Green is still the only turnover 
the team has forced so far in 2012.
  Last season, the Gators defense ﬁ  nished 
tied for last in turnovers in Southeastern Conference play with eight. 
They also ranked 112th nationally with 
just 14 takeaways on the season as they forced six fumbles and intercepted eight passes.
  “Get to the ball,” sophomore Mike Tay-lor said of what the defense needs to do to 
create turnovers. 
“If a ball carrier is holding the ball out 
and not holding it high and tight, that’s 
deﬁ  nitely a big alert that this ball could 
come out at any play. ”
  The UF secondary is also expecting 
plenty of opportunities for takeaways 
this Saturday against a Tennessee team that has coughed up the ball just three 
times through its ﬁ  rst two games. In wins 
against Texas A&M and Bowling Green, 
the Florida defense was unable to gener-
ate a pass rush as the 
opposing offense got 
rid of the ball quickly.
  The Volunteers are expected to throw 
the ball downﬁ  eld more than the Aggies 
and the Falcons, allowing the pass rushers 
more time to pressure quarterback Tyler Bray and force him into mistakes. 
Florida defensive coordinator Dan 
Quinn said he expects Tennessee to use various protection schemes to try to keep Bray upright.
  “Generally you feel that way, once you 
see some more routes down ﬁ  eld,” Quinn

turnovers against Tennessee

  Florida cornerbacks have a 
tall task Saturday.
  Not only will they face quar-
terback Tyler Bray, a preseason 
awards watch list ﬁ  xture, but 
UF also goes against receivers 
Justin Hunter and Cordarrelle Patterson. 
Hunter, who suffered an 
ACL tear during the Volun-teers’ ﬁ  rst drive against the Gators last season, leads the Southeastern Conference with 17 receptions.
  Hunter stands 6 feet, 4 inch-
es, while Patterson is 6 feet, 3 inches. 
  “They’re guys that will go 
up and get the ball,” sophomore cornerback Marcus Roberson said.
“They’re nice. We all (are) 
looking forward to it. It’s a big 
challenge for us as a group: Just 
looking to get the ball out.”  Sophomore Loucheiz Pu-
rifoy is the tallest of Florida’s cornerback rotation at 6 feet, 1 
inch.
  Roberson deﬂ  ected a pass on 
a redzone fade route to 6-foot-
5 receiver Mike Evans during Texas A&M’s ﬁ  rst drive on Sat-urday.
  “When you play a lot of 
press and bump like we do, you want to have some guys with length for when you have what we call ’50-50 balls,’” defensive 
coordinator Dan Quinn said. 
“Balls that are up in the air 
and can go to either guy. That’s 
why some of that with those two guys in particular — Roberson and Purifoy — with the length that they have, we certainly will get a lot of work at that.”
  Quinn sees a cornerback 
corps ready to take on the chal-lenge of defending Patterson and Hunter, even though Cody Riggs is out with a fractured foot. 
  “Both of them are real physi-
cal guys and accomplished players that know how to go get the ball,” Quinn said.
“Certainly it’s a matchup 
our guys are looking forward to as well.”

    When Tennessee quarter-
back Tyler Bray takes his ﬁ  rst snap on Saturday , 
Florida needs to get after him. The Gators’ pass rush — particularly the 
defensive line — has been quiet for 
too long.
  In two games this season, Florida 
has recorded four sacks and four quarterback hurries. UF defensive linemen are responsible for half of that production.
  However, rushing the quarter-
back with regularity has been difﬁ  -
cult for the Gators this season due to 
the offenses they have faced.
  Bowling Green and Texas A&M 
have both employed quick passes against Florida in schemes resem-bling the West Coast offense. As a result, the Falcons and the Aggies avoided consistent pressure.
  But with a quarterback like Bray 
on the other side of the line of scrim-mage this weekend, the Volunteers will be w o r k i n g with ﬁ  ve- 
to seven-
step drops. In other w o r d s , F l o r i d a ’ s defensive 
line has a better chance to make an impact in the passing game.
  “It will deﬁ  nitely be better be-
cause it gives us more space and more opportunity to do different moves against the offensive line-men,” Buck linebacker Lerentee Mc-Cray said of Bray’s deep drops. “It gives us more time to get back there and get pressure to him.”
  I’ll believe it when see it. Until 
McCray , Dominique Easley and 
Dante Fowler Jr. set up camp and

Rivals ranked Morrison the 
10th-best inside linebacker com -
ing out of high school. The former 
Bolingbrook (Ill.) High standout enrolled at Florida in January and made his presence felt from Day 1.
 “I always tell him that he’s soft 
because he’s from Chicago. But 
no, he’s a tough kid,” redshirt se-
nior defensive tackle Omar Hunter said.
“And to come down here, man, 
he’s adapted well to being in Flor -
ida and learning from guys like Jelani and (Jon) Bostic has really helped him out a lot. He’s doing pretty well right now.”
Morrison, who squatted 600 
pounds in high school, showed his strength throughout the offseason.
“He asked really good ques-
tions,” Quinn said. “He was really on it in terms of the details of play-ing linebacker.”
Not your average Tennessee team: 
Omar Hunter doesn’t lose against 
Tennessee.
During his time in Gainesville, 
the defensive tackle is 4-0 against the Volunteers.
The Gators have seven straight victories in the series, but Hunter sees a team different from the one

Improved Bray should be difficult for Florida defense to intercept
said. “And certainly that’s part of their of-
fense, where they’ll try to stretch the field some. They’ll also do some things protec-
tion wise, at times, to use six or seven to 
help that way, too.”
Regardless of how much pressure Flor -
ida puts on Bray, Roberson said he expects the junior signal-caller to take risks.
“He’s a daredevil,” Roberson said. “Just 
forcing the ball out. We like that.”
While he might be more of a gunslinger 
than Texas A&M’s Johnny Manziel, who hurt Florida primarily with his legs, Bray has done a good job taking care of the ball 
throughout his career with 41 touchdowns 
and just 16 interceptions.
However, two of his six picks in 2011 
came against the Gators. 
He was intercepted by safeties Josh Ev-
ans and Matt Elam. 
Roberson said Bray has improved, if 
anything, since last year’s game in the Swamp.
 “It’s about the same,” Roberson said. 
“Mentally, I think he got better.”
Even if Bray has improved, Taylor said 
the Gators are looking for a repeat perfor -
mance.

ball out,” Taylor said.

UF’s front four to harass Bray regularly.
If Florida has truly decided 
to pin its pass-rushing turn-
around on the UT game, then 
the Gators are going to have a bad time.
The V olunteers’ offensive 
line is stacked.
With all due respect to Brent 
Pease, if Tennessee offensive co-ordinator Jim Chaney told me the offensive line is his team’s 
greatest strength, I would actu-
ally believe him.
Coach Derek Dooley has 
five starters returning from an offensive line that allowed just 18 sacks last season — 13 in Southeastern Conference play . Alabama was the only SEC team that protected its quarter -
back better.
The V olunteers may have 
had the worst rushing offense in the SEC last year, but they kept their quarterbacks upright.
Florida may have more time 
to rush the passer against Ten-nessee, but the Gators will not have much leverage. UF does 
not have the same front seven 
that racked up three sacks and six quarterback hurries against UT last season.
Jaye Howard is gone to the 
NFL and Ronald Powell is like-ly sidelined for the remainder 
of the season. Add in the loss of 
Jelani Jenkins to injury, and get-ting any sort of consistent pres-sure on Bray come Saturday seems all the more unlikely.
The onus falls on Easley , 
Sharrif Floyd, Omar Hunter and McCray . It’s time for this group to make an impact in the 
passing game.
Tennessee presents the first 
true test for Florida’s pass rush 
this season, and there are no gimmicks in place to prevent UF from getting to Bray.
Come Saturday , we’ll find 
out how good the Gators’ de-fensive line will be this season.
If the Gators can overcome 
the efforts of the V olunteers’ stellar offensive line and get to the quarterback, then good for them. But don’t count on it. 
When the final whistle blows 
on Saturday night, Florida will have no explanation for its un-derwhelming pass rush.

The last time Tennessee beat Florida, 
Will Muschamp and Derek Dooley were co-workers at LSU. Muschamp served as the 
defensive coordinator and linebackers coach. 
Dooley was the special teams coordinator 
and coached the running backs. It was 2004.
The Volunteers would go on to win the Southeastern Conference East Division that year, marking the 11th time in 13 seasons that 
either UT or UF played in the SEC Champi-
onship Game.
However, once each man left the SEC to 
join Nick Saban’s staff with the Miami Dol-phins in 2005, the Gators-Volunteers rivalry 
became one-sided.
Spearheaded by Urban Meyer’s arrival at 
Florida, the Gators won seven straight games 
by an average margin of more than two 
touchdowns, while Tennessee’s program fell 
by the wayside.
From 2005-11, the Volunteers went 48-
41. During that seven-year span, Tennessee missed the postseason three times and fin-
ished under .500 four times. This season will 
mark the first time since 2007 that both UF and UT are ranked when playing each other.
“We’ve had a four-year stretch where we 
haven’t really performed to Tennessee stan-dards,” Dooley said. “For the first time, we’re at least getting talked about. But that excite-ment isn’t going to stay if we don’t play well, and that’s what matters the most.”
The Volunteers’ seven straight losses 
against the Gators mark their longest losing streak in the series, which began in 1916 but did not become an annual affair until 1990. 
However, Tennessee has perhaps its best 
chance at upending Florida for the first time since 2004. Led by quarterback Tyler Bray, the Volunteers boast the top-ranked passing offense in the SEC this season. 
Against UF last season, Bray completed 26 
passes in 48 attempts for 288 yards and three touchdowns. He was also intercepted twice.“You let him sit back, he’ll pick you apart,” 
redshirt senior nose tackle Omar Hunter said. “If you don’t get pressure on this guy, he can 
really pick a team apart.”
Aiding Bray in his aerial attack will be 
wide receiver Justin Hunter, who suffered a season-ending ACL tear in his left knee 
on Tennessee’s fourth offensive play in last year’s 33-23 loss to Florida.
The injury appears to have had little lin-
gering effect on Hunter this season. Heading into Week 3, he leads the SEC with 17 catches and ranks second with 219 receiving yards.
For all their passing prowess, however, 
the Volunteers’ rushing effort proved most costly the last time they faced Florida. 
This season, the Volunteers rank third in 
the SEC with 187.5 rushing yards per game. 
Rajion Neal, Tennesee’s primary back, is 
tasked with turning around a rushing attack that ranked last in the SEC during the 2011 season with just 90.1 yards per game.
“It’s hard to win a game, especially in this 
league, when you’re minus-9 rushing the ball — that’s for sure,” Dooley said. “We’ve got to do a good job of mixing it up, but we’ve got to throw and catch pretty good, too. At the end 
of the day, we’ve got to score points.”

For Maddy Monserez, the Active 
Ankle Challenge wasn’t just another 
three wins for the Gators. Instead, last weekend’s matches against Jackson-ville, Louisiana-Lafayette and Georgia 
Tech were the first time that the soph-
omore played right back for Florida.
“I hadn’t played it since I’ve been 
here, maybe at practice a little bit, but not in a game, so that was exciting,” Monserez said. “It was good for me to be exposed to that so I know what I need to work on. The coaches were great helping me out with it and giv-
ing me advice and my team mem-
bers on the bench were great. When I would come off, they’d let me know things that I didn’t see when I was do-ing it, so that was really helpful.”
Monserez, who typically plays 
middle back, has now played all three back-row positions in a match. Although the right back and middle 
back positions have similarities, Mon-
serez said that there is a slight differ -
ence between the two.
“On the surface it seems like 
they’re pretty similar, because it is just playing defense, but because of our system it makes a difference on where I’m supposed to go on certain balls,” Monserez said. “I’ll be more respon-
sible for tips at right back, where in 
middle back it’s mostly deeper balls. It’s mainly moving forward and back where as middle back is more side to side.”
Communication with blockers is another difference between the two positions. At right back, Monserez is responsible for most tips, so she needs to ensure that she’s not trying to dig where the front row is blocking.
The Gators are known for their 
powerhouse hitting, so practicing right back wasn’t an easy task. Monserez didn’t get to practice digging tips until Friday night against Jacksonville.
“We like to go hit so I wasn’t really 
used to working short and then going for the deep balls, so that was some-thing that I had to learn really quick during the game,” Monserez said.
D e s p i t e 
facing a lim-ited style of attacks at practice, the 
number of digs Monserez recorded per match improved significantly in her first weekend at right back. Mon-serez averaged 4.8 digs per match at 
middle back this season compared to 
6.7 per match at right back.
As the Gators head to Arkansas to 
play their first Southeastern Confer -
ence match on Friday , coach Mary Wise is confident in Monserez’s abil-ity to perform well again at right back if called upon.
“She has that gutsy type of persona 
that you want in that position,” Wise said. “Who you see off the court is the exact opposite of who you get on the court. You would never know if you met Maddy just what a bulldog she can be on the court.”

Annie Speese’s phenomenal 
freshman season last year did 
not have a happy ending.
In Florida’s 3-2 loss to UCF in 
the second round of the NCAA 
Tournament, Speese suffered 
an ACL tear in her right knee with less than five minutes left in the match when she tried to trap the ball after a throw-in.
“In one sense, it was awful, 
because it was two bad things happening in one night,” Speese said. “I knew I had plen-
ty of time to recover.”
Speese has bounced back 
since suffering the injury more 
than 10 months ago. Despite a slight dip in playing time, she hasn’t missed a regular-season contest for the No. 22 Gators, starting all six games at mid-field.
“She’s really come along,” 
Burleigh said. “She started out a little bit slow at the beginning of the season, but she’s gaining momentum as she’s gaining confidence coming back from that injury. We just expect more and more from her, because she’s a good playmaker and a 
good finisher.”
Speese excelled in her first 
season, tallying eight goals and 
a team-best nine assists.
Her 25 points  — No. 4 all-
time among Gators freshman 
— was second to fellow mid-fielder Erika Tymrak (32) in 2011. 
“Annie brings a certain cre-
ativity to the game that not a lot 
of people have,” Tymrak said. 
“She’s really crafty and a fun player to play with.”
Following the injury , Speese 
took a tenacious approach to her rehabilitation. 
“I had the spring to focus on 
getting stronger, which is what I really needed to focus on,” 
she said. “I tried to keep a posi-
tive attitude 
about it.” 
With the 
assistance  of physi-cal thera-pist Marty Huegel and 
team athletic 
trainer Emily 
Flood, Speese worked countless hours in the gym. Early on, her exercises consisted of strength-ening her right quad and ham-string. By Summer A, she eased her way into running. 
But Speese was frustrated 
when she didn’t see immedi-ate results. Her teammates re-minded her that coming back from an ACL tear was a grad-ual process.
Tymrak told Speese: “It’s 
going to be hard, but it’s going to be worth it. The pain now is definitely going to pay off in the 
end. It might suck trying to get 
back, and you might not feel like yourself, but we’re going to be with you along the way . You just have to push for it.”
Said Speese: “[My team-
mates] just kept me working 
hard. They didn’t let me get 
down on myself.” 
Burleigh has cautiously 
managed Speese in 2012, play-ing her 49.2 minutes per game — 9.7 less than last year. Speese said Tuesday her right knee is at 100 percent. 
“Obviously, sometimes it 
gets stiff like anything,” she said. “It doesn’t affect me when I play, so it’s just a matter of ic-ing after the game and taking care of it.”
During her first five games, 
she recorded five shots but no goals. 
But in Florida’s 3-2 win 
against New Mexico on Sun-day , Speese finally found her offensive groove. When her defender overcommitted, she launched a long shot from the left side of the box in the 50th minute to tie the game at 1-1. The goal was her first of the 
season. 
Surprisingly, the left-footed 
Speese booted the goal with her 
right foot.
The same knee that once 
bothered Speese gave her the bend and boost she needed to sink the shot.
“The fact she could score 
with her right, that was huge,” 
Tymrak said. “I’m really proud 
of her. It’s fun to see her prog-ress and come back from such an injury.”
