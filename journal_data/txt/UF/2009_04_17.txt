About 400 UF faculty and staff 
could lose their jobs next year if 
UF absorbs a 10 percent budget cut from the state, according to the university-wide budget proposal 
released Thursday.
About 750 positions could be 
eliminated, including layoffs, re-
tirements and cuts to vacant jobs.
Last year, when UF was faced 
with a cut of about $47 million, it proposed the elimination of about 430 positions, with 20 faculty and 118 staff layoffs. Eight faculty and 
66 staff were eventually laid off 
because some employees were re-assigned, others retired and addi-tional funding was found for other positions.
A total of about $108 million in 
cuts are being considered for next year. That includes about $73 mil-lion in cuts proposed by colleges 
and administrative units as well 
as  $35 million in previously un-announced possibilities, such as switching to a four-day week over the summer and slashing employ-ee benefits.
Machen announced the pro-
posed cuts to the Faculty Senate on Thursday afternoon. All of the pro-
posals are posted online at budget.
president.ufl.edu.
The size of the actual cut UF will 
endure won’t be determined until 
the state Legisla-ture decides on 
a budget, which should happen by May 1, when 
the regular ses-
sion ends. But it could take lon-ger if lawmak-ers can’t agree 
on a budget. UF plans to submit its final proposal to the Board of Trustees in mid-to-late May.
As it stands, UF would see its 
budget reduced by about $90 mil-lion next year under the budget being considered by the Florida House of Representatives and about $30 million under the bud-$108M budget

The retirement of Gainesville Police Chief 
Norman Botsford was announced Thursday 
night at the Gainesville City Commission meeting.
After 10 years as Chief of GPD, Botsford turned in his notice of intent to retire late Wednesday night.
“During the past four years, I have had 
the opportunity to work closely with Chief Norman Botsford and know him to be a ex-tremely capable police chief,” City Manager 
Russ Blackburn told the commissioners.
Botsford will continue his duties while 
Blackburn  conducts a four-month nation-wide search  for a new chief.
“He is held in high regard by his peers 
and recognized statewide as a 
leader in local government,” Blackburn said.
Blackburn added that he 
wanted to thank Botsford for his years of service. 
Sworn in as Gainesville Police Chief on Nov. 1, 1999, Botsford created or expanded on 14 programs to reduce Gainesville crime.
After seeing a rise in violent crime, Bots-
ford created the Tactical Impact Unit to com-bat violent crime and drug dealing.
The unit, which specializes in patrolling 
Gainesville’s high–crime areas, may have

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Elderly 
Floridians may need a driver’s license, 
passport or state ID card to vote under a sweeping bill that won approval from a Senate committee Thursday but drew op-position from voting rights groups.
Republican lawmakers who supported 
the bill (SB 956) said it’s needed to crack down on fraud and make other needed changes in the voting system.
Seniors would be affected by a provi-sion that would no longer recognize re-tirement center or neighborhood associa-tion photo IDs at the polls. The bill also would change how registration drives are conducted and how much money politi-cal parties can spend on campaigns.
It would block anyone from coming 
within 100 feet of voters lined outside of polling places and would let legislative leaders create “leadership funds” that could accept donations from lobbyists.Elderly may need license, state ID to vote in Fla. “We run the whole gamut.”

joined by several fellow Texas House Democrats, said some peo-ple associate talk of secession with racial division and the Civil War and that Perry should disavow 
any notion of seceding.
“Talk of secession is an attack 
on our country. It can be nothing 
else. It is the ultimate anti-Ameri-can statement,” Dunnam said at a news conference.
State Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Hous-
ton Democrat, said that by not re-jecting the possibility of secession 
out of hand, Perry “is taking a step 
down a very dangerous and divi-sive path encouraged by the fringe of Texas politics.”
The Democrats are proposing 
a House resolution expressing “complete and total disagreement with any fringe element advocat-ing the ‘secession’ of Texas or any 
other state from our one and indi-
visible Union.”
Perry emphasized Thursday 
that he is not advocating secession but understands why Americans may have those feelings because of frustration with Washington, D.C. He said it’s fine to express the thought. He offered no apology 
and did not back away from his

Democrats: Gov should 
disavow secession talk
AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — In a 
state that once was its own na-
tion, a Republican governor who talked about secession without completely dismissing the idea 
has Democratic lawmakers in an 
uproar.
Gov. Rick Perry, in comments 
following an anti-tax “tea party” Wednesday, never did advo-cate Texas breaking away from the United States but suggested that Texans might at some point get so fed up they would want 
to leave the union. That was 
enough to feed opinions for and against secession on Web sites, cable TV and talk radio across the nation.

�  THE NEW SITE IS IN 
N.W. GAINESVILLE.
By JACQUELYN WEINER 
 Alligator Contributing Writer 
 
A 12-acre site in the 800 block 
of Northwest 53rd Avenue will 
be the future home of Gaines-ville’s One Stop Homeless As-sistance Center, city commis-
sioners decided unanimously 
at Thursday’s meeting.
Although several locations 
had been ruled out in the past, commissioners had to make a quick decision to meet an ap-proaching deadline for state and federal stimulus money.
“Without the land, we can-
not pursue these funds,” said Fred Murry, assistant city man-ager. The potential stimulus 
earnings amount to $371,003 
from the Community Develop-ment Block Grant Program and $567,404 from the Homeless-ness Prevention Fund, accord-ing to the agenda.
In total, Murry estimates the 
city will have about $1.3 million to fund the center, with oppor-
tunities to bring in other funds, 
he said.
Murry also discussed the 
process the city took in select-ing the property, which includ-ed forming an Alternative Site Selection Group.
After considering various 
sites, the committee chose the plot on 53rd Avenue because of its location –– away from a residential area — and its acces-sibility, Murry said.
“This particular site does 
have great possibilities,” Com-
missioner Scherwin Henry 
said.
The One Stop Homeless Center is a key part of the City of Gainesville/Alachua County 10-Year Plan to End Homeless-ness, which was established in 2005, according to the county’s 
Web site.
The center will be designed 
with a homeless-campus con-
cept, providing food, shelter and a range of social services, Murry said.
Such services will be geared 
toward the chronically home-less, “not for those who are just 
temporarily out of their luck,” 
said Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan. 
“Those folks are much easier 
to house elsewhere,” she said.
At this point, the center’s de-
sign calls for 15 to 30 beds, but Hanrahan said she hopes that can be increased to as many as 200 over time — enough to 
house all of Gaines-ville’s con-sistently homeless.
“That should be where we’re 
trying to get to,” she said.
Also discussed was the issue 
of rezoning election districts. 
City boundaries have morphed 
in recent years, prompting Gainesville city commissioners to consider rezoning Gaines-ville’s election districts.
Annexations have changed 
the city’s voter base since its last redistricting in 2002, As-sistant City Attorney Stephanie 
Marchman said. According to 
the city charter, Marchman said, the commission is required to adjust election districts when-ever they feel the number of people per district has become uneven.
Commissioners responded, 
calling for an independent citi-
zen’s committee and a team of 
investigators to study the prob-lem.
UF political science profes-
sor Kenneth Wald and former UF geography professor Josh-ua Comenetz, Ph.D., will be 
paid up to $10,000 to evaluate 
whether rezoning is necessary, commissioners unanimously approved.
In addition, a seven-mem-
ber citizen’s committee will be formed to evaluate the team’s ﬁ  ndings and give their input to the commission.
Also discussed was the issue 
of maximum occupancy in local bars and clubs. A new city ordi-nance will hold these estblish-ments to stricter standards.
The ordinance, which was 
unanimously adopted on ﬁ  rst reading, allows Gainesville Po-lice Department ofﬁ  cers to en-
force certain ﬁ  re code penalties 
that are currently handled sole-ly by Gainesville Fire Rescue.
Because there are generally 
GPD ofﬁ  cers on patrol, whereas GFR isn’t regularly around, the changes will allow police ofﬁ  -cers to handle “clear violations, creating an immediate risk to 
public safety” on site, according 
to the agenda. 
The ordinance will also 
strengthen ﬁ  re code penalties and associated civil citations, according to the agenda.
Additionally, the Public 
Safety Committee is looking into regulating promoters, ac-
cording to an attached memo 
from the city attorney.
Commissioner Mastrodicasa 
spoke in favor of the ordinance, and said that overcrowding was “one of the scariest things” she has seen while participating in GPD ride-alongs.
“This will give us another 
tool in solving these problems,” she said.

Come summer, there will be 
a new Internet matching service 
for students seeking a little extra help with classwork.
Student Government and Tu-
toring Zone will be launching a private tutoring matching service via Facebook. 
“Obviously Tutoring Zone has 
filled a niche here in Gainesville, 
but it always focuses on group 
tutoring,” said Matt Hintze, one of Tutoring Zone’s co-founders.Hintze, along with Ethan 
Fieldman, the center’s other owner, put together a Facebook application that allows students to search for tutors by subject or 
course number of the class that is 
giving them trouble.
“You know, Dr. Denslow’s 
been perplexing students for 30 years,” Hintze said. 
Fieldman said the search 
should lay out tutoring options for students.  
“We’re simply bringing to-
gether a disorganized market,” he said.F i e l d m a n 
and Hintze, who both tu-tored for the 
U n i v e r s i t y 
Athletic As-
sociation after g r a d u a t i n g from UF, said 
they wanted to find a way to bring 
the same quality of individual tu-
toring sessions to all members of the Student Body.
“We’ve basically copied the 
Athletic Association on every-thing,” Fieldman said. “They have a great system worked out.”
With the Facebook applica-
tion, students will be able to shop around before picking a tu-tor. They will be able to compare 
prices as well as check student 
ratings and reviews.
“This way tutoring becomes 
much more affordable,” Field-man said, adding the competi-
tive Gainesville market will help 
drive down prices.
Once students find a tutor to 
their liking, they can book a time 
and meeting place and pay for 
the session online.Jordan Johnson, who will be 
taking over as Student Body pres-ident on May 1, said SG’s role is to raise awareness by informing students and teachers about the 
new program via e-mails, Face-
book and print ads.
Fieldman said he hopes SG 
will contact professors, graduate students and T.A.’s to help get 
the word out about the service, 
but expects the application itself to spark the most interest. 
“The great thing about Face-
book is that it will spread by it-self,” he said.

� 225 PEOPLE ATTEND THE EVENT 
IN THE O’CONNELL CENTER.

About 225 people watched Howard 
Dean speak on Thursday night in the 
O’Connell Center, which seats 12,000.                  
He discussed the “50 states strategy,”  
he is credited with developing, and the ways the Internet has changed politics.                  
Dean recently stepped down as chair-
man of the Democratic National Commit-
tee and ran in the democratic presidential 
primary in 2004 against John Kerry. Dur-
ing that campaign, he famously ended an excited phrase with a scream, which some claim damaged his chances at winning the primary. Some believe he discovered how to harness the Internet to win politi-cal campaigns, a strategy that won Barack 
Obama the presidency, he said.
“Everyone thinks that I did that, and 
I appreciate the credit. But I didn’t do it, 
you did it,” he said, referring to political 
organizers, who made up a large part of 
the crowd.
He also praised YouTube as a powerful 
political tool. 
“Who knew a 23-year-old kid was gon-
na be following around George Alan in southwest Virginia when he made a rac-ist remark, and that he was gonna be on YouTube the next day, and we were gonna 
pick up a United States senate seat in Vir-ginia?” he said, about the 2006 senate elec-
tions.
Dean then spoke about his inspiration 
for the “50 states strategy”, which advises challenging Republicans even in states and 
regions traditionally viewed as conserva-
tive strongholds, he said.
“We copied almost ev-
erything from the Repub-
lican National Committee, 
except for the cheating at 
the ballot box,” he said.              
Dean encouraged citizens to participate 
in democracy at the local and state levels, 
especially those that bring diversity to the 
political arena, he said.  He used a recently elected official to the Alabama state legis-lature, who is a lesbian, as an example.                                                    
“When you elect people that are dif-ferent, especially in places like Alabama, and suddenly every legislator in Alabama knows a person who is openly gay, that changes the complexion of Alabama,” he said. “That means that someone has to be 
seen as a human being instead of some 
minority that everyone can point to when something goes wrong.”                                               
The event was co-sponsored by Accent 
and the Bob Graham Center for Public Ser-vice, whose namesake introduced Dean.               
Accent paid at least $5,000 to rent the 
O’Connell Center, according to Andrew Guglielmo, Accent spokesman.  The Bob 
Graham Center paid Dean $1,000, well be-
low his usual fee.                                                               
“I did this for Bob Graham,” Dean said 
after his speech. “I’ve always really ad-
mired him.”Howard Dean talks about Internet politics, elections

Darts & Laurels
Thanks to a worldwide economic downturn, unemployed 
mad scientists have channeled their inner villain, causing thousands of dollars in damage – at least in Britain. For hosing hundreds of unsuspecting children’s books in London with a mixture of urine and feces, the Department of Darts & Laurels 
tosses a we-will-never-be-able-to-look-at-a-copy-of-Goodnight-
Moon-again DART at Sahnoun Daifallah. The never-to-be-em-
ployed-again chemist will now have nine years behind bars to concoct his next diabolical scheme.
As connoisseurs of Gainesville’s finest in late-night dining 
options, we do concede the allure of Domino’s delivery in 30 minutes or less, but seriously, at what cost? The Department of Darts & Laurels awards a we-can-laugh-at-Domino’s-expense-because-everybody-loves-David’s-BBQ! LAUREL to Kristy 
Lynn Hammonds and Michael Anthony Setzer for using their 
bodies to add “special seasoning” while preparing sandwiches at a Domino’s in North Carolina. Suddenly, preparing a home- cooked meal seems appealing.
If you ever find yourself in a disagreement with a man from 
Louisiana (run!), we sincerely hope you’re strapped to the gills with the finest in food stamp offerings. For stabbing his older brother in the shoulder and left arm after an argument over a can of pork and beans, the Department of Darts & Laurels chucks a 
why-aren’t-we-surprised-copious-amounts-of-alcohol-were-in-
volved? DART at the Bayou bladed bully. While sibling rival-
ry can be described as healthy so long as knives aren’t involved, two brothers with a combined age over the century mark have no business fighting over such a mediocre meal.
Hell, ever hear of Domino’s?Sheer absurdity runs rampant in podunk Peoria, Ill., where a 
13-year-old boy channeled his inner Sonny Wortzik from “Dog Day Afternoon.” The Department of Darts & Laurels presents 
a we-hear-he-was-packing-some-serious-heat LAUREL to the 
minimobster for holding up a bank and escaping the law for an 
epic 30 minutes. We probably sound like a broken record at this point in the semester when we say we don’t condone stealing, but robbing a bank before hitting puberty takes nothing short of what Alec Baldwin would call some serious brass balls.
Word out of good ol’ Port St. Lucie reveals news of two 
women who thought they could exploit the self-checkout line at one of our absolute favorite stores. For leaving behind recently 
developed photographs in their shopping cart after stealing

like the state of Florida’s finest constantly finding themselves on the bizarre news pages of media outlets across the country.

Francis-must-have-been-grinning-from-ear-to-ear LAUREL to 
Comcast Cable for cutting away from Pope Benedict XVI to a 30 second “Girls Gone Wild” commercial that would make any red-blooded American male shout “Lord Jesus!” And per-haps, for the first time ever, pitching a tent during mass could be deemed socially acceptable.
That’s all for this week. Good night and good luck.By majoring in a field that places a heavy emphasis 
on the proper use of language and simultaneously being a since-birth member of Generation Y, Z, XXX 
or whatever the hell we’re called, I’m caught between a rock and a hard place. Everywhere I hear people horren-dously butchering the language I’ve spent the last 20-odd years trying to understand.
I don’t care so much about typos and misspellings the 
way other anal-retentive journalism nerds do (a specific red-head comes to mind). My beef stems from the verbal abuse of the English language.
Don’t jump the gun and assume I’m an over-enunciat-
ing, slang-hating, anti-profanity ass. Slang and profanity make the English language versatile and evolving, which is what makes writing worth my time. Plus, hip-hop would suck without them. Remember when “My Name 
Is” came out? Imagine if Eminem’s video lyrics matched 
the lyrics on the actual record. Nobody would understand why Em was asking kids if they liked Primus (though I’m sure Les Claypool appreciated the name-drop).
My language anger originated from the un-word 
“ain’t.” This word, more than any other, can make the most educated person sound like Cletus the slack-jawed yokel. “Ain’t” takes all valid points and lucid thoughts and throws them into an overflowing bathtub with a 
box jellyfish. Growing up surrounded by mumbly slang, 
southern twangs and stoner drawls — you know what I’m talking about, where people try to sound more tired than they are — “ain’t” was the universal stupidifier. 
“Ain’t” got me started, but acronyms and abbrev.’s 
have elevated me to new levels of irritation. LOL worked fine in AIM, but in conversation, I think it’s easier to physically laugh aloud — especially if something’s actu-ally funny. As for brb, piss off. If you’re going to be right back, then just say it because it’s only three 
measly syllables. (OK, I’m guilty 
of this one, but I kicked my own ass for doing it).
Presumably following the lead 
of LOL and brb, people have start-ed lopping off what they deem are words’ unnecessary letters.
“Ridiculous” drops a syllable and morphs into “ridic.” 
OK, that’s tolerable. 
“Vomit” devolves into “vom.” This will only work for 
me if the medical community decides to put it into prac-tice. Symptoms: Vomming? Check. That could make it worthwhile.
“Random” loses its last letter to become “rando.” I 
don’t get this one at all. You don’t save any time because it’s still two syllables. Plus, it reminds me of Sylvester Stallone.
Most recently, I overheard a guy call something “inap-
prop.” I laughed when I heard it, but a little part of me died inside. “Inapprop” ruined my Wednesday and forced me to examine the fate that has befallen my mother tongue. I hope Darwin was right and natural selection swoops in 
to put this trend out of its misery, otherwise our word-
trimming will have dire, embarrassing consequences.
This practice better not invade the world of phrases. 
If we reach a point where it’s socially acceptable to get down on one knee and ask, “W-Y-M-M?” I will “Thelma-
and-Louise” myself into a gorge.

Anonymous column invalid
Dear Anonymous,
In response to your article on 
Thursday, I feel it is unethical to engage in this form of personal at-tack under the convenient fascade 
of anonymity. 
Journalists may have valid rea-
sons for not revealing their sourc-
es, but one hopes that writers will feel confident enough to publish their own opinions under their own name. Not to do so, particu-larly in the context of SG politics, raises questions about the real mo-
tivations of the author and detracts 
from any validity of his or her comments. 
SG officials are elected to over-
see the administration of the bud-
get and to accomplish specific 
campaign goals. Shaking hands, “furtive glances” and the dreaded use of “ums” in no way detracts from an official’s ability to produce positive, tangible results for stu-dents. Nor indeed do such minor signs of nervousness distinguish President-elect Jordan Johnson 
from the majority of student lead-
ers on this campus or any other. 
The author concludes by urging 
Johnson to “thoroughly review the current allocation and distribution of the approximately $13.3 million SG budget to ensure fair and bal-anced management.”
Worthy goals, but hardly ones 
that are determined exclusively by public speaking ability. In my two years in SG, I have seen plenty of skilled rhetoric used to hide bad or nonexistent ideas. I encour-age Anonymous to place a higher value on real substance than flashy but empty style.

Insecticides crucial to society
With Earth Day approaching, 
some people may be advocating 
against unnatural forms of crop 
production, but consumers need to 
realize that even organic farming utilizes insecticides. 
According to a recent study that 
came out from the Crop Protection 
Research Institute, it was noted that 
insecticides are a necessity in crop production.
More than 144 billion pounds of 
crops would be lost, and there has 
been a $20 billion increase in yield 
value in the United States.Though some argue that many 
insecticides can be detrimental 
to human health, we need to un-
derstand the overall benefits that they’ve been providing for centu-ries. 
Not only do insecticides prevent 
the spread of disease, but they main-
tain a steady supply of food for con-
sumers while keeping the agricul-tural industry a booming success.
In agreement with the report 
from CPRI, insecticides are crucial 
to the survival of our society.

Wednesday was Tax Day in America. 
Like many of my collegiate peers, I paid very little in taxes. In fact, 
my parents still claim me as a tax deduction, which means that my very existence produces 
red ink for Uncle Sam. This may be a satisfy-
ing fact to remember as I watch the mailman pick his nose, but it hardly qualifies me to preach the virtues of taxation. In reality, I am almost completely divorced from the modern American reality of paying taxes.
Naturally, this blissful ignorance seems 
like an ideal perspective from which to opine. What’s the fun in bloviating if you actually 
know what you’re talking about? It certainly 
hasn’t stopped most of the primetime lineup on Fox News.
If you’re reading this, I will assume a 
few things about you. First, thanks to the combined efforts of local police and the U.S. military, you are not dead. Additionally, as a product of our education system and a re-cipient of state college funding, you are (prob-
ably) literate. 
My point is this: security, law and order, 
education — they have a price, and I’m not 
quite cheap enough to subcontract the federal government’s responsibilities to the Tennes-see Bible School and Militia Training Center. So unless you’re prepared to dissolve every arm of the federal government and cast the country into anarchy, I’ll assume you accept the imperative of taxation in some form. If not, I’d invite you to examine Somalia as an example of a failed state. If you’re proud of the U.S. Navy, just wait until you see U.S. pi-
rates in action!
This year, Tax Day came with a cherry on 
top. In addition to the usual fringe lunacy 
about abolishing the Internal Revenue Service, we were treated to the spectacle of Tax Day tea party protests. These events, organized in large part by Republican strategists and pro-moted heavily by the “fair and balanced” Fox News Channel, were manufactured to convey 
the image of a grassroots revolt, a nationwide 
cry of protest against the unjust taxation and spending policies of the Obama administra-tion. For some, the protests provided a perfect excuse to be drunk, angry and stupid in pub-lic. For others, perhaps those more in touch with their inner Samuel Adams, the tea par-ties became a license to say and write ridicu-lous, faux-revolutionary nonsense.
Case in point, Republican strategist Brad-
ley Blakeman, writing on Politico.com: “My message to those in power is a simple one. Get out of our way!... Mr. President, you can tell your socialist buddies at home and abroad, tyranny in 2009 shall not prevail in America. Like 1773, it is Tea Time in America!”
I’m tickled by his message to the powerful. “Get out of our way!” cries the mouthpiece of the politically exiled and impotent. “Or we will complain at you!”
The excitable (and 
wealthy) Mr. Blake-man, in his haste to bayonet that damn Redcoat, President Ba-
rack Obama, has predictably omitted a few critical facts.
The president’s recovery package, passed 
with the help of only three Congressional 
Republicans, contained the largest progres-
sive tax cut in American history. Thanks to the president and Democrats in Congress, 95 percent of working families are paying less in taxes now than they were a year ago, a fact conveniently forgotten by Mr. Blakeman and the rest of the Minutemen. These Republicans clamor for lower taxes and then vote against them. 
More Benedict Arnold than George Wash-
ington, if you ask me.
Despite the impression created by frantic 
derelicts waving signs like “No more debt!” and “Stop mortgaging our future,” about 80 percent of the current national debt piled up under Republican administrations. President George W. Bush allowed more deficit spend-ing than any president in modern history, almost doubling the national debt during his tenure. Yet, for eight long years, we heard nary a peep from these Teabaggers. Where were the deficit hawks while former Presi-
dent Bush was financing his ill-conceived 
militarism with borrowed money? Appar-ently deficit spending becomes perilous only when it is harnessed to a leftist Democratic agenda. 
Health insurance for the working poor? 
Heavens no! But there’s always enough money for a war or two. I’m sure you under-stand.
I didn’t see any signs of populism from the 
right wing while they were in power. They consistently stiffed the working class, offering a culture war instead of economic assistance, laughing all the way to the ballot box. And when they fall from grace, knocked off their pedestal by a combination of arrogance and ineptitude, they turn to the working class for help, for political solidarity, for tea parties. 
They embrace the populism only when they 
need the populace. If they fool enough people to make it work, it will be called good political maneuvering.
I have another word for it, but I probably 
can’t publish it here.

Soybean fiber underwear offers 
an eco-friendly way to help save the 
planet, starting with Uranus.
Natalie San-Andres, 22, a UF bi-
ology senior and Lauren Golik, 23, a UF journalism alumna , are the brains behind the Uranus Apparel brand, featuring underwear made from 47.5 percent soybean fiber.
The idea for the soy shorts be-
gan in Miami during the summer of 2008, when the co-founders were 
painting a sibling’s bedroom that 
had photos of planets plastered to the ceiling, San-Andres said.
“Maybe it had something to do 
with the paint fumes,” she said, ”but the idea to have an underwear com-pany called ‘Uranus’ was born.”
After researching, they chose the 
soybean as the main material for the 
environmentally aware clothing, 
San-Andres said.
“We sought to create a product 
that would promote sustainability through a sense of humor,” Golik said. 
In honor of Earth Day, which is 
on April 22, she said they will be handing out free undies on campus 
Wednesday.
The women’s boy-short style un-
derwear come in sets of three and 
are packaged in a biodegradable burlap pouch, San-Andres said. The set includes one black, one beige and one moss-green pair. Golik said the soy fabric is made from byproducts of soyfood production, including 
material that would otherwise be 
thrown away from tofu and soybean oil.  
She said the shorts are produced 
in China, one of the world’s top pro-ducers of soy products.
The shorts are softer, and soy 
lasts longer than cotton, San-Andres said. The product was described as 
“buttery-soft” by Treehugger.com, a 
pro-Earth blog Web site. Though the underwear is the only product  of-fered by Uranus Apparel, Golik said they hope to expand to other styles and more clothing such as T-shirts. 
She said the brand was completely self-fund-ed, so business started 
off small.
However, she hopes they contin-
ue to expand and invest in further 
environmental efforts. 
“We have future plans to donate 
a percentage of our proceeds to sus-tainable farms,” San-Andres said.
In response to various e-mails, 
Golik said the  next project is to 
launch a men’s soy boxer-brief.  
The item will be presented at a 
launch party and available for pur-
chase soon, she said.
Golik said advertisement for the 
product has come from word-of-mouth and YouTube videos which feature the co-founders and rela-tives dancing and doing random 
activities while wearing the prod-
uct.

� UF ADMISSIONS IS NEED-BLIND, 
ACCORDING TO OFFICIALS.
By KATHRYN STOLARZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
Many colleges are favoring wealthier appli-
cants this year due to funding cuts and students’ 
swelling financial need, a New York Times ar-ticle from March 31 stated.
But Director of Admissions Patrick Herring 
said UF is not one of them.  
“We are need-blind and have operated that 
way forever,” Herring said.  “We would never look at ability to pay as a criteria for admis-sion.”
Although family income is on UF’s ap-
plication, it is not factored into its admission decisions for any applicants including under-graduate, graduate, international and transfer 
students.  Students’ financial aid requests are 
on separate documents that the admissions of-ficers do not see.
Herring said the article “Paying in Full as the 
Ticket Into Colleges,” probably has little truth to it and likely was printed to sell more news-papers.
“That makes good copy, but we have some 
pretty strict rules in our professional guidelines 
that preclude that,” he said.  
UF and other members of the Association of 
American Universities generally follow a need-
blind admissions process, meaning admissions officers are not aware of whether applicants have financial need, Herring said.
The article said some college counselors 
believe that not indicating financial need on a college application would give the applicant an 
edge.   
UF freshman Mona Sayedul Huq said she 
thinks that UF might take applicants’ financial 
situations into consideration in its admission decisions.  She said the majority of her wealthy friends from high school who got into UF had lower grades and SAT scores than her low-in-come friends who did not get accepted into UF.
“I do think that there is a very big possibility 
that UF will accept wealthier students over low-income and more talented students,” she said, after noting the possible budget cuts to UF.
To deal with potential cuts in state funding, UF is considering departmental budget cuts and faculty layoffs for the  2009-2010 academic year in anticipation of less state funding.  Also, 
UF is accepting 200 fewer freshmen this year 
and 4,000 fewer undergraduate students in the next four years.
The article also said some universities are 
shifting more financial aid to merit aid because needier students on scholarship might pay the college nothing, while wealthier students on scholarship would likely pay some of the tu-ition.  Merit aid is money that goes to qualified 
but not necessarily needy students.
UF also does not fall into this category. In 
fact, UF is working to increase its distribution 
of need-based aid.  
Rick Wilder, UF’s associate director of finan-
cial aid advising and funds management, said UF has never decreased its financial aid, and fi-nancial aid would probably increase next year.  
“Students need the money to go to school,” 
he said.  “Without it, it would prevent needy 
students from attending the uni-versity.”
In the 2006-2007 academic year, 
$124 million of UF students’ fi-
nancial aid was need-based, and $277 million was merit-based, he said.  This 1-to-3 ratio has been consistent in the past couple of years, but it could change with UF President Bernie Ma-
chen’s recent effort to expand UF’s Florida Op-
portunity Scholars Program.
Machen launched a $50 million fundraising 
campaign in the fall to grow the program, UF spokesman Steve Orlando said. The program pays for living expenses, including rent and food, for students with family incomes of less than $40,000 a year who are the first people in their families to go to college.  
There are currently more than 1,000 students 
in the program.  Machen’s goal is to add about 400 students to the program, Orlando said.
The University Athletic Association contrib-
utes more than $5 million of the $6 million a year put toward the program.  Machen declined his $280,000 bonus this year and pledged it to the program.   
The percent of Pell Grants given out at UF 
has increased 18 percent in the past eight years, Orlando said.  A Pell Grant is funded by the federal government and is financial aid for low-
income students.Colleges favoring wealthy

Students will have a new reason to 
dread summer classes — the start of mi-
nus grades. 
The new grading scale will launch 
nearly a year and a half after the Faculty 
Senate voted to implement the new grad-
ing scale.
According to Faculty Senate records, 
the decision was made in order to give faculty more options when assigning grades. Provost Joseph Glover officially announced minus grades would start summer A 2009 in October.
Under the new scale, plus grades will 
have a lower grade point amount as-signed to them. A letter grade of B+ will go from a 3.5 to a 3.33 under the new sys-tem. A solid B will remain a 3.0.
Students will not receive Gordon Rule 
credit for classes they receive a C- or low-er in.For classes with the satisfactory-un-
satisfactory option, also known as S-U option, students must also have a C or higher to get credit.
Because the grading scale is not man-
datory, professors can decide whether they want to use minus grades.
And professors teaching the same 
course can have dif-ferent grading scales, 
even if they are teach-
ing the same material.
Professor Mike Fo-
ley, a UF journalism professor, said he will 
not use minus grades.
Foley teaches the 
journalism reporting 
class, one of the most-dropped classes 
within the entire journalism college.
“The class is tough enough as it is 
without using minus grades,” he said.

� ABOUT TWO MILLION TEENS 
ARE AFFECTED BY DEPRESSION.
By JESSICA RONAY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Although stress, moodiness and lack 
of sleep come with the territory of being a 
teenager, these factors should not go un-
noticed, according to one medical report.
Recent evidence shows about 6 per-
cent of American teenagers are clinically 
depressed, influencing a government-ap-pointed medical panel to urge doctors to perform routine depression screenings on teens. According to a report in the April issue of the professional journal ‘Pediat-rics,’ most teenagers with depression are 
undiagnosed and untreated, and screen-
ing and early detection can help prevent the disorder from progressing.
The study also suggested having pri-
mary care doctors be more involved in mental health care and providing phar-macological treatment for depression. 
With about two million teenagers af-
fected by the condition, Alan Barnes, a 
UF associate professor in the department of psychiatry, suggests screening patients 
who have a certain array of symptoms.
The key is distinguishing between a 
depressed teenager and a teenager ex-periencing typical angst, Barnes said. He advises screening teens who complain 
about lack of energy, poor concentration 
and sleep disturbance.
An average teenager may be unhappy 
or rebellious, but a depressed teenager 
will avoid social situations and suffer from severe bouts of sadness, Barnes said. Charles Key, 23, has suf-
fered from clinical depression ever since 
he was a sophomore in high school and 
remembers sleeping through entire days to avoid dealing with everyday issues.
“Sometimes I’m just so sad that I don’t 
want to do anything,” Key said. “It’s like I’m in a clouded state of mind.”
Teenagers often utilize alternative 
forms of self-treatment, such as substance abuse and experimentation with drugs. 
Others turn to self-destructive behavior, 
such as suicide, Barnes said.
“There is no question that the rate of 
depression is rising,” Barnes said. “We can only hope that Florida and its leaders begin to recognize it.”Teen depression on rise

7 percent in 2008.
“When it comes to innovations, 
one of the many things Chief Bots-ford did for the department was 
take us out of the dark ages with 
technology,” GPD spokesman Keith Kameg said.
Kameg said the officers went 
from hand writing police reports and having poor intelligence dis-tribution to going paperless and re-ceiving up-to-the-second updates through their laptop computers.
Botsford also helped expand 
the department’s facilities.
“For the last 40 years, we were 
crammed into a small building,” Kameg said. 
Botsford has helped make plans 
that include a community center, a training center and renovations to the original building located on NW Sixth St., he said.
“He was able to look long term, 
which is very important at our agency,” Kameg said.
During Botsford’s tenure as 
Chief, he faced challenges.Over the past year, five officers 
left the department after breaking the rules and several others have received warnings, Kameg said.
Two officers were forced to 
leave GPD after an internal inves-tigation found that they were hav-ing sex with prostitutes while on duty. One officer is currently un-der an internal investigation for a DUI arrest that was thrown out by the State Attorney’s office.
Three GPD officers were report-
ed in the media last week for driv-
ing through Porters Community 
in Southwest Gainesville near De-pot Avenue, with intent to harass prostitutes and drug dealers.
“No one is proud of the behav-
iors of or personnel in the recent days,” Kameg said.  
Despite the circumstances sur-
rounding his departure, Botsford 
has considered retiring for some 
time.
After being in the business for 
40 years, Kameg said, if anyone deserves a break from law enforce-ment, it’s Botsford.
“Will he be missed? Absolute-
ly,” Kameg said.FRIDAY, APRIL 17, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 11

UF is beating the University of Califor-
nia at Berkeley at its own game.  
About 40 percent of UF undergradu-
ates have completed the Student Experi-
ence in Research University survey, which was created at Berkeley to find out how students feel about the college experience, making UF the top participating school.
The survey, which UF students need 
to fill out to enter the football ticket raffle, takes about 20 minutes and asks questions that compare students’ development and overall satisfaction with UF. It is the first year UF students have been asked to fill out the survey.
Having the highest percentage of stu-
dent participation would mean bragging 
rights for UF and better information on students, which the school can use to make improvements, 
according to Jeanna Mastrodicasa, UF’s vice president for student af-fairs.
“It’s hugely nerdy,” 
she said, “but it’s a big deal. It means we’ll have really good data on our students.”
In any case, Mastrodicasa said, “If 
they’re undergraduates and they want football tickets, they’ve got to do the darn survey.”UF leads in SERU survey
dreds of boxes line one wall waiting to 
fill shelves as quick as they clear, Curl said.
“Even if you’re really avid about 
something, you don’t have to be here 
first thing in the morning,” she said. 
“The shelves are restocked throughout the day.”
Books are organized by genre, includ-
ing history, science fiction and fantasy, 
religion, gardening and military. Some 
subcategories, such as “books that went to movies,” add flavor to the shelves.
During the sale, volunteers are paired 
with sections that they have knowledge in, for instance a doctor will work at the health section, Curl said.
Ron Beauchamp, who owned a record 
and a CD shop for 20 years, was pricing albums in preparation for the sale.“We have everything from classical, 
to jazz, to rock and pop,” he said. “We run the whole gamut.”
Beauchamp estimated that there 
would be 3,500 CDs for sale.
CDs will range from about $2 for sin-
gle discs to $7 for multi-disc sets.
For those interested in rare items, 
there is a “collector’s corner” containing first-edition books, numbered artistic 
prints and signed memorabilia.
The corner has several Gator football 
posters signed by UF quarterback Tim Tebow and other team members, rang-ing from $5 to $15.
Art, including large grave rubbings 
from England and folk art depicting Sept. 11, will be sold outside of the ware-house.

get passed Thursday by the state 
Senate, according to UF President Bernie Machen.
Machen said it’s likely the size of 
UF’s cut will fall somewhere in be-
tween those two figures.
“If you split the difference, that 
puts us at $50 (million) to $75 mil-
lion, which is where we thought we’d be,” Machen said.
In January, Machen asked all 
colleges and administrative units to propose 10 percent budget cuts in anticipation of a $72 million to $75 
million hit.
Machen said UF is slated to re-
ceive about $41 million from the 
federal stimulus package next year and another $41 million in 2011-2012.    Because there is no guaran-tee the money will be available after that, Machen said he will not use the money to fill the budget gap.
“We can’t count on this stimulus 
money as permanent money,” he told the Senate on Thursday.
Instead, the money will be used 
for transitional purposes. For in-stance, faculty cannot be laid off immediately–they must be given notice periods that are up to a year in some cases. Stimulus money 
would be used to continue paying 
their salaries before the layoffs take effect, Machen said.
In addition to college and ad-
ministrative proposals, Machen is considering other options that would limit the impact to academic programs but reduce employee ben-efits and result in 111 layoffs across campus.
The layoffs are included in a pro-
posal to consolidate UF’s communi-
cations team. Currently, about 186 
employees work in various commu-nications departments in colleges and other units. The proposal would slash that number to 75 and concen-trate them into four or five offices, saving about $6 million. However, about $1 million would be needed in the first year to pull it off.
In other university-wide propos-
als, UF would consider cutting the summer week to four days, which would save about $65,000 in utili-ties.
Machen said the move is prob-
ably not worth the sacrifice. “You got to look at the gain for the pain,” he said.
Another proposal would reduce 
the amount faculty are paid over the summer by creating a standard summer pay rate for all faculty, in-stead of paying them a percentage of their annual salary for teaching summer classes. Machen said most universities pay their summer facul-ty a standard rate. The change could 
save $3 million.
UF will also consider tweaks to 
its vacation and sick-leave policies.
Under one proposal, the amount 
of unused vacation time employees 
could cash in on when they leave UF would be capped at 240 hours. UF could also stop allowing employ-ees to collect money for unused sick 
leave and unused December vaca-
tion time.
Under another proposal, em-
ployees 70 years or older would be offered a year’s worth of salary in exchange for retiring, paid for by stimulus money.
Machen said he favors these 
types of cuts to ones that would im-
pact academic programs, but he said 
he wants to know how students and employees feel about the idea.
 “I lean towards administrative 
cuts, but I think we gotta have dia-logue about that,” he said.
As for whether he would favor 
undergraduate or graduate pro-
grams when making cuts, Machen 
said it depends on the program.
Although UF’s Board of Trustees 
recently stated its desire to shift the university’s mission more toward graduate education and research, it doesn’t mean UF will come down harder on undergraduate programs, he said.
“The uniqueness of UF is in our 
graduate and research mission,” he said. “That’s what separates us from all the other universities in the state, and we need to keep that in mind, but that doesn’t mean we would only cut undergrad.”Comparing UF’s budget process 
to that of The Florida State Univer-sity, Machen said he thinks UF has 
been much more open.
On Monday, when FSU an-
nounced its budget proposal, which 
includes the elimination of 21 aca-demic programs and 350 faculty lay-offs, Machen said most FSU faculty found out about it when they read it in the paper. 
“They’d never heard anything,” 
Machen said. “We’ve had them (the proposals) out in most colleges for several weeks,” he said.
Another difference, he said, is 
FSU’s athletic program will be un-scathed by cuts, whereas UF has asked the University Athletic Asso-ciation to also make a 10 percent cut, even though it is not funded by state money.
The money the UAA would cut, 
$6 million, would be donated to UF, Machen said.
Also announced at Thursday’s 
Senate meeting were plans to pos-sibly move spring break up a week and a recommendation from a Sen-ate committee to establish a travel holiday on the Wednesday before 
Thanksgiving.
Both recommendations still need 
to be voted on by the full Senate. The 
spring-break change would take ef-fect in the 2011-2012 school year, and the travel holiday would start the year after that.12, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, APRIL 17, 2009

POLL QUESTION ONLINE NCAA SESSION I RESULTSBy BRIAN STEELE
Alligator Staff Writer
bsteele@alligator.org
The Gators have 935 pounds 
of leadership, toughness and 
girth to replace on the offen-
sive line this year. 
That’s the combined weight 
of Phil Trautwein, Jaston Wat-kins and Jim Tartt, all of whom 
were crucial to the line’s suc-
cess the last two years as they totaled 91 starts in their career. That’s no easy task, and replac-ing those three begins at the Or-
ange and Blue Game at 1 p.m. 
in The Swamp on Saturday.
So here’s some good news 
for the Gators: Marcus Gil-bert was praised as one of the 
most improved players on the 
roster last year, and he has al-ready found a home at one of the tackle spots. Same for Carl Johnson, who filled in for Tartt 
as he struggled recovering 
from shoulder surgery. 
Here’s even better news for 
the defending national cham-pions: Sam Robey and Matt Patchan are also being praised. Robey may even be starting at center after spending time on the scout team last year as he struggled with a left knee in-
jury.
Now, there’s bad news for 
UF: The coaches are thrilled 
with the improvement of Robey and Patchan, but they’ve found 
these gems because of all the 
injuries the line — not to men-tion the entire team — has en-dured this spring.
Starters Mike and Maurkice 
Pouncey, now the veterans of the line, have struggled with shoulder injuries, and Maur-kice is out for three months af-ter undergoing surgery. James 
Wilson, a potential starter at 
guard, has been hampered by 
a foot injury, and Jim Barrie 
is still recovering from a torn ACL. 
“I’m never wanting any 
of my friends to get hurt, but it’s giving a lot of guys an op-portunity to get reps and to grow, especially guys like me 
who never really got a chance 
to play last year,” said Robey, a redshirt freshman. “Every-body’s getting a lot of experi-ence because guys are out.”
As it stands now, the open-
ing-day offensive line would probably consist of the Pounc-
ey brothers, Johnson, Gilbert UF FOOTBALLLinemen get chance to show mettle in spring game
Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff 
UF redshirt freshman center Sam Robey prepares to snap the ball during the Gators’ spring practice Monday 
afternoon.
Get ready for an ugly Orange and Blue 
Game.
It might as well be called “Pre-
view of the Fourth Quarter of the Charleston Southern Game.”
Then again, that’s pretty long for a mar-
quee.
It must be something in the water in 
Gainesville. Last year the team lost several  players to ACL injuries including playmaker Cornelius Ingram by the time confetti was falling in Miami. The injury bug is getting an early jump on the Gators in 2009. 
Guys you won’t be seeing in The Swamp 
on Saturday: Janoris Jenkins, Mike and Maur-kice Pouncey, Carlos Dunlap, David Nelson, Justin Trattou, Lawrence Marsh, Terron Sanders, Brandon Antwine, Brandon James, Jeff Demps (he’s running track), Riley Cooper (baseball), Brandon Hicks, A.J. Jones, James Wilson, Steven Wilks and Desmond Parks.
Aside from the last 
two, all those Gators all be in competition 
for starting spots for 
the  season opener, and nine (Jenkins, the Pounceys, Dunlap, Nelson, James, Demps,  Cooper, Marsh) of 
them are virtual locks for Sept. 5.
While this is bad news for fans driving to 
Gainesville on Saturday, it is only a minor 
setback for a UF team hoping to be the first 
repeat champions since Nebraska in 1994-95.  (Sorry, Southern Cal, your split crown in ‘03 isn’t cutting it.)
Every one of the currently injured players Injuries to make for poor game � THE GATORS FINISHED 2ND 
BEHIND NO. 1 GEORGIA.
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
Herculean effort, compliments of 
Maranda Smith.
The junior danced, vaulted, swung 
and balanced her way to a third-place 
finish among all-arounders in Session 1 of the NCAA Championships.
Smith was vital in the No. 5 Gators’ 
196.375 second-place finish on the first — and what could have been the only — day of the championships. UF’s placing guarantees them a spot in the Super Six, starting tonight at 7.
UF beat out No. 4 LSU for the second 
time in a row after losing to the Tigers on Feb. 6. UF also beat No. 8 Oklahoma, No. 12 Penn State and No. 9 Stanford. No. 1 Georgia  came out on top with a 197.450.
“Just elated,” said UF coach Rhonda Faehn, proud of the determination her team displayed.
The second-place finish was anything 
but guaranteed after the Gators’ bumpy start. Freshman Amy Ferguson waited 
on deck, second in the floor exercise 
lineup after Courtney Gladys. Ferguson, 
who has been con-sistent all season, fell on two of her passes  and staggered to a 9.025. Ferguson never scored lower than a 
9.75 this season and 
averaged a 9.82 before 
Thursday.
“It was a shock, 
I think, to everybody, emotion-wise as well, because she’s just been such a rock on that event,” Faehn said.
Caught off guard, the team recoiled 
with Smith and Melanie Sinclair posting 9.85s. Faehn and Smith didn’t believe the 
performances warranted the low scores UF advances to Super Six

some of the gymnasts received.
The team hiccuped again on the next event, vault.
Smith provided a pick-me-up 9.9 on vault, the highest 
Gators mark by a tenth of a point. 
“We didn’t seem to get that momentum going in front,” 
Faehn said. 
Faehn pointed out how the team rebounded with “unbe-
lievable (uneven) bars” and finished “extremely aggressively” 
with their highest event score on balance beam.
The team’s improvement after the first 
two less-than-stellar events showed Faehn how much the Gators had matured as gymnasts and as competitors. In the past, 
Faehn said, the team sank mentally from 
trouble in events, and gymnasts would get quieter or more ner-
vous. 
“We did not see that with this team,” Faehn said. “Even 
through the little mistakes, they just were not going to give up.” 
She identified the resiliency, cheering and energy of her 
team as the deciding factor in the meet. Four Gators tied with a 9.85 on beam, including Smith, matching her career best. 
“I just count myself out when it comes to beam,” Smith said. 
“(But on Thursday) I was like, ‘You know what? You got to go up there and you got to do the best beam routine you can.’ And I did that,” she said.
Freshman Elizabeth Mahlich bested her teammates with 
a 9.875. The team placed second, but as an individual, Smith shined brightest.
“Her leadership came through, and she didn’t let any nerves 
get to her,” Faehn said. “Maranda was just a superstar.”Smith scores high on vault, 
beam to lift Gators’ spiritsand either Wilson or Robey. 
But that first matchup against 
Charleston Southern on Sept. 5 
is a long way away, and a bunch 
of bruises and pains are going to 
have to heal first.
“Everyone says we got a 
patched-up line,” Robey said. “Ev-
ery day we just got to go out there and keep working. Since we got young guys, it’s all about flying off the ball, good technique. Just be 
aggressive and finish.”
Offensive coordinator Steve 
Addazio said he was pleased with 
the versatility of the line.
“It’s all about developing depth right,” Addazio said. “We’re tak-
ing a look at all these young guys. 
We know what these older guys can do.”
One thing the older guys can 
do is provide leadership for their 
younger teammates. Even though 
they’ve been in and out of practice, the Pounceys have still made their 
voices heard from the sidelines.“I’ve grown up a lot more,” 
Maurkice said. “Now I’m the older 
guy. … All the guys are looking up 
to me and my brother.”
This group isn’t lacking con-
fidence either. Patchan admits 
there’s much work to be done, but he does have a special list of adjec-tives he feels will be an accurate description of UF’s offensive line 
in 2009.
“We’re going to have a very 
ferocious, very athletic, talent-
ed, special, monstrous (group),” Patchan said. “These are all good 
words for us.”
He also had one more expres-
sion to describe the group.
“We’ll probably be using ‘not 
very good looking,’” Patchan said.
is expected to return for fall besides Wilks, a promising 
fullback, but Meyer has done just fine without a fullback in the past.
It has also given lesser-known players a chance to 
shine, and this could pay dividends later.
Redshirt freshman Sam Robey has stepped up in the 
absence of Maurkice Pouncey, and now Robey looks like a legitimate prospect to start or play significant time 
at center in the fall. Pouncey could slide back to right 
guard where he earned Freshman All-America honors two years ago. 
“He’s still a young guy, but he’s a guy that’s show-
ing us signs that he can really give us quality depth,” offensive coordinator and line coach Steve Addazio said earlier this spring. “That gives you more flexibility.”
Another younger guy who has had a breakout spring 
is defensive tackle Jaye Howard. The redshirt sopho-
more gained weight and moved from end to tackle and will now provide depth in the fall at one of the Gators’ 
weakest positions.
Wide receiver Frankie Hammond has also made 
some noise in the past three-plus weeks. Nelson is in-jured, Cooper is playing baseball, Thompson missed part of the spring, and the redshirt freshman Hammond, who earned some praise last fall but never played, has gotten a good look from the coaches. 
Don’t worry, though. You’ll still be able to get a copy 
of Urban Meyer’s book, “Urban’s Way,” autographed by the man himself Saturday morning, and you can still watch the Powder Puff Championship at noon, or even the Fastest Gator on Campus race just before kickoff. All will likely be better fare than the glorified scrimmage that follows.
Then, 20 weeks from now, as UF enters the fourth 
quarter of its rout of Charleston Southern, fans will ex-perience déjà vu.
They will remember a day back in April when they 
saw the “Preview of the Fourth Quarter of the Charles-ton Southern Game.”Patchan confident in offensive line’s abilities

As a walk-on freshman, Michelle Moul-
trie has quietly made an immediate impact 
on the UF softball team. Very quietly, ac-
cording to her teammates.
Moultrie, who became the starting cen-
ter fielder for the Gators when senior Kim Waleszonia fractured her left knee, has 
played in all of UF’s Southeastern Confer-
ence games and has recorded the second-most stolen bases on the team this year (12).  But the lively, outgoing personalities of her 
teammates —  like left fielder Francesca Enea 
— haven’t altered Moultrie’s calm, quiet de-
meanor.
“If I can hear her cheer in left field, then 
I’m like, ‘OK, I guess I gotta be a little bit 
louder because I can hear Michelle,’” Enea 
said. “She does everything a good player’s 
supposed to do. She just won’t make fun of me, and I want her to sometimes.”
She’s not expressing her gratitude by 
poking fun at Enea, but Moultrie is extreme-
ly thankful to be a part of the top-ranked 
Gators and to play with Enea and the rest of the team.
“It was really amazing for Coach to see 
such potential in me that I could play on this team,” Moultrie said. “I didn’t expect it. 
There are so many great players on this team 
that it’s just been a privilege and a blessing to be able to play.”
This weekend, Moultrie and No. 1 UF 
(43-3, 20-1 SEC) will take on No. 18 LSU (27-
10-1, 10-6-1 SEC) in a three-game series in 
Baton Rouge, La., where the Gators have yet 
to win a game under coach Tim Walton.
Before coming to UF, Moultrie attend-
ed the softball camps held by the team in Gainesville. The first time Enea saw Moul-trie play, the freshman cranked a home run 
out of the stadium. 
“I was like, ‘That girl’s really good.’ Then 
I saw her come out (in the fall), and I was like, ‘Oh wow,’” Enea said. “Even though she doesn’t know the game all that well, she 
has gotten so much better at it. She listens 
to everything we say, and she really tries to 
soak in everything.”
Enea, who leads the team in home runs, 
RBIs and several other offensive statistics, 
has reached out to help Moultrie develop at 
the plate, noting that the freshman already 
has the talent to succeed in the field.
“I talk to her more with 
hitting stuff, not as much as the outfield because she’s so 
fast she could cover the whole 
thing out there,” Enea said. 
“For hitting, I just tell her to 
not get worried about stuff, 
relax out there, it’s not a big deal.”
While there are aspects of her game that 
still need improving — her batting average of .241 is the lowest among regular contribu-
tors — Walton complimented Moultrie’s de-
pendable play so far this season.
“She’s done a lot of good things, hasn’t 
done a whole lot of bad things and hasn’t 
done a whole lot of great things. She’s just 
been consistent,” Walton said. “She’s done 
everything I’ve asked her to do, and she’ll 
get better and better and better as she gets a little more confidence and a little more used 
to seeing the caliber of teams she’s seeing 
day in and day out.”
There’s one specific area in which Enea 
thinks Moultrie can already improve, though.
“She needs to talk more,” Enea said, 
laughing.Moultrie lets play speak

The No. 16 UF women’s tennis 
team closes a turbulent regular sea-
son against No. 20 South Carolina at 
10 a.m. on Saturday.
The Gators (12-8, 6-4 Southeast-
ern Conference) are tied for third  in the SEC East with the Gamecocks, so the two will also be competing for a higher conference tournament seed. The SEC Tournament begins Thursday.
The team has hit plenty of bumps 
this season. After a quick 4-0 start, UF ran into trouble in the Intercol-
legiate Tennis Association Indoor 
Championship in Madison, Wis., in mid-February, returning to Linder Stadium as a .500 club.
During the ITA Indoors on Feb-
ruary 13, the Gators lost a leader in junior Megan Alexander, who has since sat out with an undisclosed injury. With only five scholarship 
players, they added three walk-ons.
“Years like this year, you find 
the true color of an athlete,” UF 
coach Roland Thornqvist said. “As a coach, you really find out a lot about your personnel and the team and the whole program during years like this. We’re certainly going to 
keep plugging away.”
And the team has fought tooth 
and nail to do 
that. Six of its eight losses have come by a slim 
4-3 final score. The team has not lost at home, 
stretching a reg-
ular-season win-ning streak to 75 
games with its win against No. 31 Auburn on Sunday.
“We’re fighting,” Thornqvist 
said. “Some matches we might not have been as good as the other team, 
but I’m really proud of them. They’re 
giving everything they have. We’re banged up in spots, but no excuses. It’s the Gator way.
“You put your head down and 
you give it all you got. If you come up short, you shake the other team’s hand and say, ‘Good job,’ and move on to the next one.”
MEN FINISH SEASON ON ROAD: 
The No. 10 UF men’s tennis team 
also meets South Carolina, but its 
regular season will end in Colum-bia, S.C. The Gators (15-7, 6-4 SEC), 
third in the SEC East, will get nearly a week’s rest before heading back to 
Auburn, Ala., where they dropped 
a hard-fought match 4-3 against the Tigers on Sunday.
Like the women, the men have 
had their share of disappointments over the spring. No. 100-ranked Ty-ler Hochwalt has been sidelined for all but one match. Freshman Carlos Cueto was held out of singles play 
against Auburn with back spasms, 
but coach Andy Jackson does not expect the soreness to carry over to Saturday’s 2 p.m. match.
UF is deep, though, and Jackson 
said he expects his team to respond in the SEC Tournament.

� THE MEN’S TEAM BRINGS 
EXPERIENCE TO GEORGIA.

 The UF men’s golf team has been 
preparing for the postseason all 
year.
With the core of the team com-
prising juniors and seniors, the team knows this could be its best chance to win a national championship be-fore many key golfers graduate.
The No. 7 Gators will travel to 
Sea Island, Ga., to begin their quest for a title as they play in the South-eastern Conference Championships on Friday.
One of the graduating seniors, 
Billy Horschel, has felt the urgency to win a title since he stepped on campus last fall, and he believes the 
other upperclassmen have as well.
“I think they all have that ur-gency, too, knowing that this could 
be their last year they even have a 
chance at a title,” Horschel said.
However, UF heads into the post-
season reeling.
The team is com-
ing off its worst 
performance of the season. The Gators ﬁ  nished in 13th place at the U.S. Collegiate 
Championship last weekend. That was just the second time this season the team has ﬁ  nished an event out-side the top ﬁ  ve.
UF has had more than two weeks 
to think about that performance, but coach Buddy Alexander has made sure the team does not dwell on that one tournament.
But if the Gators are going to win 
this weekend’s event, they will have to outplay No. 1 Georgia. UF has played with Georgia in three tourna-
ments this season, and the Bulldogs 
have ﬁ  nished ahead of the Gators in each one.
UF will send out Horschel, Tyson 
Alexander, Tim McKenney, Toby Ragland and Will Strickler to vie for the SEC Championship.
WOMEN READY TO DEFEND SEC TITLE:  The No. 31 UF women’s 
golf team will also be participat-ing in the SEC Championships this 
weekend. 
The Gators will travel to Co-
lumbia, S.C., to play in their event 
beginning on Friday.

 While Preston Tucker has homered his 
way into the spotlight, another freshman has 
been key to the Gators’ success at the plate.
Daniel Pigott has been the last piece to the 
puzzle early in the batting order.
UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan knew he need-
ed Matt den Dekker, Avery Barnes and Josh Adams near the top of the lineup, but there were still holes.
To ﬁ  nd the right hitter, O’Sullivan played 
with the order on a game-to-game basis to ﬁ  nd a combination he liked.
Pigott earned more at-bats as Riley Cooper 
struggled to put the ball in play. As Pigott’s hitting continued to shine, he settled into the two hole, where he has started the last nine games and where he will be when UF (25-12, 9-6 Southeastern Conference)  starts its week-end series with Mississippi (26-10, 9-6 SEC) tonight at 6:30 in McKethan Stadium.
“The key to (our recent success) is Daniel 
Pigott being able to solidify that two spot,” O’Sullivan said. “It pushes everyone down 
one, so it gives us some ﬂ  exibility and some 
strength at the bottom of the order.”
When the season opened, Pigott’s chances 
of getting on the ﬁ  eld looked slim. He was stuck behind Cooper for the starting right-ﬁ  eld job, and Cooper jumped out to a hot start.
Through the ﬁ  rst eight games, Cooper hit 
.360 and scored in each game except one.
Since then, Cooper has averaged .203, just 
above the Mendoza Line, and his strikeout total ballooned to 41 in just 89 at-bats. 
His 41 strikeouts are still the most on the 
team.
Cooper’s poor hitting re-opened the pre-
season competition for the right-ﬁ  eld job with Pigott and his older brother, Jonathan, vying for playing time.
Daniel outplayed his sibling to win the 
starting spot, but he might not have been able to do so without Jonathan’s help.
“For all (the other freshmen), these coach-
es are new, but to me it seemed like they have 
been here for a while be-cause my brother has been through a year of it. I knew all about them,” Daniel said. “He’s been around. He knows the ins and outs of everything. He has 
helped me out a lot.”
Daniel’s .321 batting 
average has been aided 
by the protection surrounding him. In front of him, Daniel has den Dekker, a preseason All-American, leading off. Barnes and Tucker then threaten pitchers after Daniel.
It has allowed the younger Pigott to see 
better pitches because opposing pitchers fear putting runners on for the Gators’ sluggers, and den Dekker worries pitchers with his speed on the base paths while Pigott is at-bat.
With so many other strong hitters, it’s easy 
for a pitcher to forget about Pigott.
The talented freshman has beneﬁ  ted from 
the combination of talent around him.
“Knowing you’ve got great hitters before 
and after you takes the pressure off,” Pigott said. “I think some see as Matt’s up, then the freshman, then Avery, but it helps a lot.”
Pigott and the rest of the hot UF bats have 
a challenge ahead of them in the Rebels’ 
pitching staff.
They are third in the SEC in ERA (4.22), 
strikeouts (344) and wins (9). O’Sullivan said 
he sees no weaknesses in the Rebels’ rota-tion.
But that pitching staff can’t overlook Pig-
ott, or he could create problems for them early. UF golf teams set sights on SEC Championships
