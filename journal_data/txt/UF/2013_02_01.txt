40years“It is a day we expected to 
neither note nor remember.
Instead it marks our 
independence .”
Celebrating 40 years of independence   February 1, 2013February 1, 1973Dear Readers,
Today marks the 40th anniversary 
of The Independent Florida Alligator’s, 
well, independence. Our ﬁ  rst issue hit the stands Feb. 1, 1973, debuting a publication that has since seen the Gators win three national football championships, six UF presidents lead the university and the population of Gainesville nearly double in size.
Forty years ago, there was no Internet, 
no cellphones and no iPads. The Student Government reporter didn’t send out live updates from Senate meetings because Twitter was decades from being invented. Stories were punched out on typewriters as production workers designed pages by hand.
As the pervasive digital world has 
increasingly changed journalism, the Alligator has evolved. Today , we see story ideas on Facebook, edit our articles in Google Docs and create layouts in Adobe InDesign. We are not the same paper we were 40 years ago.
But make no mistake: Our 
independence is more crucial than ever.
Being independent isn’t about 
bashing university administrators or printing curse words. It’s not a gimmick, it’s not a liberal agenda and it’s not a superiority complex.
The Alligator’s independence is so 
vital because it enables us to serve our readers the best way we know how. Independence allows us to deliver honest reporting that casts a critical eye on university ongoings, city events and global news. No subject is off-limits. We have the freedom to investigate, 
experiment and — most of all — inform.
When you read 
the Alligator, you know where the content is coming from. All of our 
reporters and editors are students. We pour our hearts and souls into every single edition, which means working too much, staying at the ofﬁ  ce too late and drinking too much coffee.
When our predecessors separated 
from the university all those years ago, they might have been young, but they knew exactly what they were doing. They were giving us the power to operate as our own entity , to cover news as we saw ﬁ  t, to make mistakes and have to deal with them.
There’s no one over us. Nobody is 
dictating what we can and cannot print, and that’s often a positive and negative thing — at the same time. People hate us, people love us, but we hope all those people know we’re trying our damndest to do the right thing. 
We appreciate our independence 
because it holds us even more accountable to you, the readers. You deserve to know what’s really going on in your community without sugarcoating or ulterior motives. You deserve a newspaper that’s committed to giving you the facts, whether they’re good, bad or ugly.
The Alligator staff of 1973 did not 
believe in censorship, and neither does that of 2013.
And for the next 40 years, and the 
40 after that, and the 40 after that, we’re going to keep working with this history in mind. After all, they say the elder years are always the most fun.
Thank you,
The Independent Florida Alligator

VOL. 65, NO. 75
originally printed on page 8 of The Independent Florida 
Alligator on Thursday, Feb. 1, 1973
It was Feb. 1, 1972, a year ago today.
The editorial of The Alligator began, “Maybe it’s time for a 
showdown.”
The second graph ran a bit longer: “Maybe it’s time for UF 
President Stephen C. O’Connell to come out from the protec-tive conﬁ  nes of his Tigert Hall ofﬁ  ce and make public some of the actions he has in mind for The Florida Alligator in the near future.”
The near future came soon. The Alliga-
tor would not have long to wait.
TODAY IS Feb. 1, 1973.It is a day we expected to neither note 
nor remember.
Instead it marks our independence.We are pleased with the idea of indepen-
dence. Not because we are libertarians.
We were never bothered by those who called us hypocrites 
because we used the student activity fee. We never wavered from our belief that students had the right to distribute the fee as they saw ﬁ  t. But it did bother the university.
It never disturbed us that we had our facilities on campus. It 
was in the student union, built with student money, for student activities, and for the student newspaper. We slept ﬁ  ne.
BUT THE university could not.Out of it all came a plan for independence.We welcome it today.BUT UNLIKE OTHERS we did not accept it blindly. We have 
been suspicious this last month — over the university’s motive, over the validity of the ad hoc committee’s plans, over the sur-vival of The Alligator.
We believe our efforts have been to help — not to haunt — 
The Alligator.
This we will know soon, for several issues are still to be re-solved.
One will take many years. It is called editorial freedom. The 
Board of Directors — with the passage of a policy giving edito-rial control to the editorial staff — has taken a ﬁ  ne step in that direction.
BUT THERE are many steps left to be taken. A critical one is 
to insure that the board select Alligator editors strictly on jour-nalist abilities -- and with the knowledge that a paper without 
controversy is a paper without readers.
Another issue, though, is much closer 
to home — and will be decided in the next several days.
It is our ﬁ  nancial survival.WE HAVE ESTIMATED that with the 
president’s plan The Alligator will have a $6,000 deﬁ  cit. We have estimated that it will take $20,000 to start up an inde-pendent Alligator. We have estimated that the accounts from January we had expected will fall short by some $20,000.
The board is negotiating for $42,000 in student salaries to 
cover this loss.
Those negotiations are being conducted in good faith. We 
need this money. And we expect the president to do his part to help us get it.
But there are others who can help us also — particularly you 
the faculty member, and you the administrator.
For years The Alligator has come to you free. And it will con-
tinue to do so. Now we need your ﬁ  nancial support.
So call it what you want. A faculty subscription or The Al-
ligator Independence Fund. We’ll call it your vote of conﬁ  dence, your vote that an independent student newspaper can make it on this campus.
Contact us at The Alligator.Sixty-ﬁ  ve years and 74 days ago The Alligator was born on 
the University of Florida campus. They say the elder years are always the most fun.
Viva The Independent Alligator.
This is the list that started it all — about 40 re-
ferral services available to women dealing with un-
wanted pregnancies nationwide. 
Abortion and the publication of any material 
concerning abortion was illegal in the state of Flori-da under an 1868 statute, but, energized by the First Amendment, the Alligator staff rebelled.
After the newspaper’s printer refused to publish 
the list on the front page as the staff had intended, editor Ron Sachs made the decision to run the infor-mation as an insert. 
The night of Oct. 5, 1971, Student Body President 
Don Middlebrooks paid $200 out-of-pocket to make about 22,000 copies of the ﬂ  ier. 
Before he went any further, Sachs asked the Al-
ligator newsroom: “Everyone has to realize that you all can be convicted of a felony . Are you really sure you want to do this?”
They agreed to move forward.Sachs signed the master copy, declaring his re-
sponsibility for the act of deﬁ  ance.
The next morning, Alligator staffers stuffed them 
into the newly delivered newspapers before readers took them from the racks. 
Sachs was arrested. UF President Stephen C. O’Connell held a press 
conference condemning the decision. 
Meanwhile, many women who had both illegal 
and legal abortions called and sent letters to the Al-ligator thanking staff members for publishing the list. 
The law was eventually declared unconstitution-
al. The state’s legislature was forced to rewrite the law and loosen the restrictions.
Monday, Oct. 4, 1971  
The Florida Alligator published 
a story on the outcome of a Board of Student Publications meeting to determine whether an article listing abortion referral services could be published in Monday’s edition. The meeting adjourned without a ruling due to lack of quorum. 
The board failed to act by its 5 p.m. 
deadline, which meant publishing the story would be at the risk of the editor, according to its general policies.
The article was removed from pub-
lication for its scheduled date, Thurs-day, Sept. 30, by the newspaper’s edi-torial advisor, Alan K. Whiteleather. The article was removed from publi-cation due to Florida Statute 797.02 of the Florida Constitution, which ruled the printing of any material related to abortion illegal.
After the removal of the article, the 
Editor-in-Chief, Ron Sachs, requested a hearing before the board for a ﬁ  nal decision on the article’s publication.Tuesday, Oct. 5, 1971  
Sachs ﬁ  led suit against the Board 
of Regents after a story including abortion referral listings was ap-proved for publication by the Board of Student Publications.
The decision to ﬁ  le suit came 
after Sachs and the editorial board discussed the possibility of publish-ing 22,000 leaﬂ  ets to furnish with Oct. 5, 1971’s edition of the Alliga-tor. 
The article was not printed in 
Tuesday’s edition due to a decision made by the Alligator’s printer, Don Maxwell. He told Sachs he would not print the article to avoid the risk of being prosecuted.
After further discussion with 
Alligator representatives, the Board of Student Publications voted 4-3 in favor of printing the material. Sachs called UF President Stephen C. O’Connell that night to inform him the staff would go ahead with publishing the list.Thursday, Oct. 7, 1971  
After the distribution of 22,000 
mimeographed ﬂ  iers of abortion referral services on top of page three in regular editions of the Alligator, Sachs was arrested. He turned himself in to sheriff’s deputies and was released on his own recognizance. No other ar-rests were made because the as-sistant state attorney determined Sachs had sole responsibility for the list. Attorney Chuck Chance and UF constitutional law profes-sor Fletcher Baldwin defended Sachs. 
In a press conference, 
O’Connell said if convicted, Sachs faced a year in prison, ﬁ  ring as editor and possibly expulsion. O’Connell said he would speak with Florida’s attorney general regarding whether the UF presi-dent could exercise prior restraint to stop publication of certain con-tent.Viva The Independent Alligator

UF got a special shout out from Gov. Rick 
Scott in his $74.2 billion state budget proposal 
for the upcoming ﬁ  scal year.
In a press conference Thursday in Talla-
hassee, Scott said the budget proposes about $3.8 billion to Florida universities.
He said $15 million of that would be dedi-cated to helping UF become a national top-10 public university as ranked by the U.S. News and World Report, a goal referenced last month when Scott and UF Board of Trustees Chair David Brown requested Bernie Machen stay UF’s president.
That $15 million would go toward hiring 
new faculty, according to a UF press release, which would reduce the student-faculty ratio and attract scientists.“Gov. Scott has clearly placed his trust and 
conﬁ  dence in the University of Florida and its 
ability to be a top-ﬂ  ight in-stitution, and we welcome this news,” Machen said in the release.
Scott also said the bud-
get would continue to 
“hold the line on tuition in order to make college more affordable.”
“I don’t think tuition should be going up,” 
he said.The budget, which will now go to the Flor-
ida Legislature for consideration, includes $100 million for four universities to construct STEM-focused buildings.
UF would seek the funding to create a new 
chemistry building, according to the release.
In addition, Florida’s universities would 
receive $167 million in performance funding, which Scott said would help schools meet the needs of students and parents.
“We’re doing the right thing for educa-
tion,” Scott said.

Chickenpox has inﬁ  ltrated 
the Levin College of Law.  
The college released a mass 
email to students Thursday , 
which stated that one student was diagnosed with the infec-tion.
Richard Goldstein, associate 
director of communications for the college, said it took the ad-vice of public health experts on the main campus to distribute the email.
With the contagiousness of 
the infection, students who are unsure if they’ve had chicken-pox or the vaccine in the past can visit the Student Health Care Center for a lab test. The test provides evidence of im-munity , said SHCC Marketing Coordinator Catherine See-mann.
She said the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention encourages college students to receive the vaccination.
The SHCC offers the vac-
cine, which is two doses taken at least 28 days apart, Seemann said.
“A lot of people say , ‘I don’t 
need the vaccine,’” she said. “The vaccine exists to prevent the illness from happening. Just because you haven’t had it, doesn’t mean you are im-mune.”
Seemann said the university 
does not require immunization for chickenpox, but it does rec-ommend it on immunization forms for incoming students.
Diane Webb, registered 
nurse specialist at the SHCC, supplied the law college with information concerning the in-fection.
“We try to promote health 
and focus on prevention,” she said. “When you get chicken-pox in college, it just isn’t fun.”
Webb said even Barbara 
Walters, who is now 83, cur-rently has the chickenpox.
“Chickenpox does not dis-
criminate,” she said.

Freshman consumption of beer is 
at an all-time low.
About 33 percent of college fresh-
men reported drinking beer in 2012, 
according to a recently released sur-vey by the Cooperative Institutional Research Program at the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California, Los Ange-les. It has dropped about 40 percent since 1982 as reported by the study , “The American Freshman.”
But UF freshmen were surprised 
by this number, and many doubted its validity.
“I don’t know if it’s the willing-
ness to admit or if it’s actually that the number has gone down,” said Robbie Houston, an 18-year-old UF exploratory freshman. “But I don’t think the number has gone down that much. I think people are just more shy to admit that they drink beer.”
The study is based on data from 
192,912 full-time students in their ﬁ  rst ofﬁ  cial year at 283 four-year colleges and universities across the country.
Freshmen drinking less beer than ever“The vaccine exists 
to prevent the illness 
from happening. Just 
because you haven’t had 
it, doesn’t mean you are 
immune.”

◗ THEY TUMBLED WEDNESDAY.
COLLEEN WRIGHT
Alligator Writer
UF cheerleaders will now be able to 
do more than shout and clap at Gators 
games.
UF’s University Athletic Associa-
tion communications senior associate athletics director Steve McClain said cheerleaders will be able to do a few stunts since the UAA banned them from all tumbling and stunts at prac-tices, events and games in November.
The UAA implemented the ban 
after an Orlando Magic cheerleader fell from a stunt and injured herself during a game against the New York Knicks.
“We made a few modifications 
to allow the cheerleaders to do some basic stunts and tumbling that we feel comfortable with regarding their safe-ty,” he wrote in an email.
He said the changes went into ef-
fect last week.
Jason Merslich, a 28-year-old for -
mer Gators cheerleader and coach, said the UAA now allows back hand-springs, chairs and shoulder sits.
“These are things that 4- and 5-year-
olds can do,” Merslich said.
He said the team is grateful for the 
leeway . Wednesday night’s basketball game was the first time cheerleaders could stunt since the ban.
UF recreation, parks and tourism 
senior and team captain Tarin Moses tweeted, “First basketball game back with stunts... Well kinda. #babysteps,” from her @TarinMoses Twitter ac-count Wednesday.

Three UF students are on a 
mission to raise money to visit 
Kenya to see the effects of two major projects they’re working on through the Southern Eco-nomic Development Organiza-tion.
The organization, started in 
2007, addresses the problem of poverty and bridges the gap between research and practice in Kenya and other areas of Af-rica.
UF professor and doctoral 
student Levy Odera, a Kenya native, founded the organiza-tion with friends at Valdosta State University during their undergraduate studies.
Odera said the goals of the 
organization, which is regis-tered as an international non-profit in Kenya, are to prevent business failure, create long-term and stable employment, increase employment and col-lect enough data that can be used for other African coun-tries.
Linguistics junior Fiona Ho-
gan, 19; food and resource eco-nomics senior Caleb Christmas, 22; and criminology and law senior Robert Shelton, 22; are the UF students interning for Odera.
For the students and profes-
sor to go to Kenya, the orga-nization sent its project to the 
Dell Social Innovation Challenge to compete for grants. 
P e o p l e 
can vote for the project on the chal-lenge’s web-
site.
“We really need those 
votes,” Odera said.
He said the results will de-
termine if they can go to Ke-nya.
Hogan said students log into 
the website and register with their Gator 1 card. The website will then send a confirmation email to let them vote.
The organization’s main 
system, Solving Poverty in Real-Time, monitors and gives advice to small businesses in-stantly in Kenya.
“This system will connect 
them to experts all over the world and advise them how to succeed in an instant,” Odera said.
The poultry project and the 
microfinance project are pro-grams under the main system the UF students will be work-ing on.
The poultry project helps 
women who already know how to raise chicken expand their businesses for profit in Kisumu, Kenya. The microfinance proj-ect is for women with HIV or AIDS in Kenya with businesses that are not succeeding. 
Odera and his interns will 
be fundraising for the microfi-nance project with a banquet in March or April.

The traditional academic track 
may be in jeopardy . 
A new study from Inside Higher 
Ed shows that colleges are relying 
more on temporary teachers and less on professors with the lifetime job security of tenure.
Tenure gives permanent status 
to professors who distinguish them-selves through their university con-tributions by teaching or research-ing, according to UF’s Office of the Provost website.
Out of the top 1,081 college and 
university leaders responsible for hiring and evaluating faculty , 65 percent said they rely significantly on faculty that are not on track to receive tenure, according to the 2013 Inside Higher Ed Survey of College and University Chief Academic Of-ficers.
Although UF has lost the abso-
lute number of tenured faculty over time, it has maintained the ratio of tenured to nontenured faculty pret-ty well, said Associate Provost for Academic Affairs Angel Kwolek-Folland.
In 2011, the university employed 
1,719 tenured regular faculty.
Over the past 
decade, the per -
centage of regular faculty on tenure out of the total university faculty has remained above 80 percent, according to UF’s Office of Institu-
tional Planning and Research web-site.
Lawrence W. Kenny , a professor 
in the Warrington College of Busi-ness Administration, said he’s been a UF tenured professor since 1980.
Kenny said hiring more tempo-
rary faculty gives a university lati-tude to hire and fire if a degree or field becomes less marketable.
“The university’s really hurting 
now,” he said. “Half a dozen years with no raises and people are leav-ing.”
Kwolek-Folland said it’s primar -
ily a financial issue. Tenured faculty might earn up to $25 million during their time at the university, she said.
Kwolek-Folland said planning 
out funding 20 years in advance is a large financial commitment for any university. Paying a faculty member to teach without making the finan-cial commitment to tenure provides more flexibility, she said.
Kenny said the economic pres-
sures facing state legislatures has taken much of the funding away from research, which can be cut without many people noticing.
“Some may not make it back to 
the quality that they had before,” Kenny said.
At UF, every department has 
had to make cuts in the past three to four years, Kwolek-Folland said. However, she said the emphasis on research at UF has allowed the uni-versity to retain a large population of tenured faculty.

London, Paris and Washington, D.C., are 
cities that have bike-sharing systems, but one 
Orlando company wants Gainesville to be put on that list.
Peter Martinez, founder of SunCycles, said 
his company is planning to bring the idea of a bike-sharing system to Gainesville through the city commission.
Unlike other companies that have riders rent bikes from specific stations, Martinez said SunCycles will allow bikes to be rented and returned within a designated area.
He added that the drop-off and pickup lo-
cations will be listed on the company’s web-site.
“We want to increase cycling culture and 
increase parking for all bikes,” he said.
Martinez said installing regular bike-shar -
ing stations can cost about $28,000 to $50,000. His company’s system, he said, would be a cheaper alternative.
SunCycles uses chainless bikes that have 
GPS trackers installed. Riders will have to reg-ister online to use a bike.The prices range from $5 for 24-hour access 
to $99 for an annual access.
The membership provides bike riders with 
a PIN, which they punch into the bike’s built-in keypad to unlock the bike.
Martinez said he hopes the company will 
be in Gainesville by May 2014. The company is still waiting on an agreement with the city to park the bicycles on public land.
Gator Cycle store manager Fred Lintz said 
anything that gets people out on bikes is a good thing.
Sarah Elbadri, Gainesville SunCycles di-
rector of operations, said the bike-sharing sta-tions would be placed in highly traveled areas in Gainesville, including UF’s campus.
She said the bike-sharing system could be 
a cheaper alternative to purchasing a bike. El-badri said the bike-sharing system could elim-inate “bicycle graveyards” on campus.
University Police Capt. Jeff Holcomb said 
500 to 600 bikes are abandoned on campus each year. New bike-sharing program could be coming to Gainesville
“We want to increase cycling 
culture and increase parking for all

70 TOTAL VOTESThursday’s question: Do you know some-
one who has been ticketed for jaywalking?Help our culture become more open
Jadin Bell was 15. Jadin Bell was bullied on a daily basis 
for being gay. Jadin Bell hanged himself. He was taken off life support this week, showing only little brain ac      
tivity.
Imagine Jadin Bell as your own sibling or family mem-
ber. Picture yourself in the situation, in the hospital, staring at his limp body. Imagine the seizing grief. Imagine the hor-rible guilt. Imagine the questions.
Such questions have kept me up for many a night.What does it take for someone to decide to commit sui-
cide? How much of a hell does life have to be for someone to decide that to continue living would be a fate worse than death?
How does this happen? How does this keep happening? 
Why do so many of our gay youth kill themselves?
For me, the question lying beneath all of this is the ques-
tion of the culture. Is our culture one that truly welcomes the healthy development of young minds?
I think that as long as prejudice exists to such a large de-
gree in our society, the lives of our youth are at risk. As long as bullies feel validated and righteous in their cause, and as long as the victims of the bullies feel degraded and worth-less, I think children will continue to kill themselves.
Homophobia runs rife through our culture. Homophobic 
symbols can even be found at the heart of UF’s campus.
The university prides itself as an institution that is 
“committed to non-discrimination with respect to … sexual orientation, gender identity and expression...” But, if the university really were so committed, why is there still a Chick-ﬁ  l-A on campus?
When asked about his stance regarding gay marriage, 
Dan Cathy, president of Chick-ﬁ  l-A, said by questioning the traditional deﬁ  nition of marriage, we’re “inviting God’s judgement on our nation.” In 2010 alone, Chick-ﬁ  l-A do-nated nearly $2 million to anti-gay groups.
While Cathy has claimed to have changed his tune, he 
has still been supporting groups that work against equal opportunities under the law for homosexuals.
It was recently reported that Chick-ﬁ  l-A’s tax forms 
indicated no donations to anti-gay groups. These reports are based solely on the words of Shane Windmeyer, a gay activ-ist in higher education, who also recently announced his organiza-tion, Campus Pride, has suspend-ed their boycott of Chick-ﬁ  l-A products.
However, Windmeyer later 
clariﬁ  ed his position, saying Chick-ﬁ  l-A is still, in fact, donat-ing money to anti-gay groups.
According to the Gainesville Sun, a petition was draft-
ed for UF President Bernie Machen some time ago in the hopes of ﬁ  nally removing the establishment from campus. The petition had nearly 1,000 supporters. According to the petition’s creators, it was delivered to Machen. To my knowledge, Machen has not responded, and the Chick-ﬁ  l-A remains.
I think every one of us has to take a personal interest in 
what our culture looks like. We all have a role to play, no matter how small, in creating the culture.
If you have any sympathy at all for Jadin Bell and those 
like him, I invite you to consider the fact that by eating Chick-ﬁ  l-A products you’re helping fund the people and lobbies who create his story.
This isn’t some bold assertion. It is a fact that when you 
give money to Chick-ﬁ  l-A, they go and spend it on lobbies that are hostile to liberty, lobbies that continue to afﬁ  rm a strong homophobic presence within our society. How could anyone honestly come to the conclusion that this is only a matter of a chicken sandwich?
We have to do our best to create a culture in which we 
can all ﬂ  ourish freely. This means ceasing to support orga-nizations that serve interests and ends counter to those we want to create.
Ask yourself what’s worth more to you: Jadin Bell’s life 
or a sandwich?

Beyonce held a press conference this week and totally

She started her Super Bowl press conference off by singing the national anthem, ﬂ  awlessly. We give a it’s-OK-to-be-a-perfectionist-because-you’re-Beyonce-and-you’re-awesome LAUREL to

don’t appreciate all of the cultural references you gave us, but it might be time to let the big dogs play on their own. Find another fun project to work on instead.
Gun control talks and school shootings continued this 
week. “This is not a difﬁ  cult equation, if I can prove that there is no Constitutional impact on your right to bear arms and the action I’m suggesting can in fact demonstrably show some people could be saved then this seems to be a no-brainer to me,” said Vice President Biden, according to a Politico article. We give a as-long-as-you-try-to-do-something-we’ll-be-happy-but-also-please-pass-it LAUREL to Biden. We will basically never care how much

NBC does very few things correctly. Fans and followers 
of comedy will praise it for its legendary programs like “Saturday Night Live” and will curse it for how it treated “Community.” This week, however, marks the end of “30 Rock,” a series led by Queen of Comedy, Tina Fey. Dry your tears, nerds, for we’re conﬁ  dent that Fey will be back on our screens soon — maybe just in a much lesser way because she’s busy raising the next Fey. Plus, who will make such awesome jokes about Florida for us? We give a heartfelt there-there-don’t-cry DART to NBC. Yeah, yeah, 
we know every show has to end at some point, but we also thought “30 Rock” was different and special.

Student Government elections 
are about representing students and gaining their perspectives 
on which issues are most important.
The codes that govern SG elec-
tions state that political parties are allowed to be engaged in “campaign activity” four weeks before elec-tions. Campaign activity includes passive actions such as making an-nouncements or electronic posts that students can choose to pay attention to or ignore.
Swamp Party strives toward 
transparency and effectively con-veying its ideas to the students while receiving feedback from every demographic on campus. 
Swamp Party announced its 
candidate for Student Body presi-dent, vice president, and treasurer within the four-week campaign ac-tivity time and perfectly adheres to campaign codes. The announcement informed students of the candidates’ qualiﬁ  cations.
Swamp Party believes students 
should be given time to research the candidates and provide feedback on what they would like to see im-proved on campus, as long as it is within the four-week time period.
All electronic posts and an-
nouncements made from Swamp Party have been compliant with the campaign codes and have not ex-pressed any explicit language solicit-ing votes. Swamp Party’s posts have included an article on past accom-plishments and information on how to slate for Senate, in order to inform the Student Body and engage stu-dents as much as possible.
Swamp Party is also dedicated 
to serving its constituents and the entire student body. On Jan. 25, a member of the Students Party ﬁ  led a complaint against Swamp Party. The Elections Commission notiﬁ  ed both parties that the hearing would be held on Sunday night.
On Sunday night, all six commis-
sioners were there, as well as repre-sentatives of Swamp Party. No rep-resentatives of Students Party were anywhere to be found. The commis-sioners waited 20 minutes before de-ciding to postpone the hearing. The Students Party failed to attend the hearing and failed to represent the students it stands for.
This was not the ﬁ  rst time the 
Students Party abandoned its con-stituents. Over the summer, when a bill about election codes was put in front of the Senate, almost ev-ery member of the Students Party ﬂ  ed the chambers before the Senate voted on the legislation. Students Party failed to return to the chamber to vote on other pieces of important legislation.
Swamp Party is dedicated to a 
fair election and to responsibly rep-resenting the students of UF.

Speaking OutIn Saudi Arabia, women 
cannot drive.
In India and China, 
some newborn girls are killed at birth.  
Women’s rights in the U.S. 
have come a long way, from the suffrage movement to the feminist movement; from the exclusion of women in the workforce to the inclusion of them in the military.  Women in the U.S.  now have more rights than ever.
But we can’t forget what has 
troubled women of all nation-alities: rape.
At some point in her life-
time, every woman has feared being raped. If it is dark out-side and she is out alone, she fears being raped.
Sometimes we feel unsafe 
taking a walk at 11 p.m. to clear our minds because we’re wor-ried some creep will follow us and take advantage of our singleness. We’re not leaving Library West at 4 a.m., we’re just going to spend the night —  it’s too much trouble and too much risk. When we’re walk-ing home alone, our keys are in one hand, and in the other, we are on the phone so that, just in case something does happen, there is sound evidence of what happened on the other line.
This may be an exaggeration 
to some, but for others, this fear is a part of daily life.  
Though victims are not al-
ways women, men are less likely to be raped.  
One in four college women 
has survived rape or sexual as-sault.Rape is worse than being 
robbed or stabbed — those are external. Rape is intimate. It is unwanted, and it is internal. It is taking control of the inside of the body. It is less about sexual pleasure and more about con-trol and power.
We’re not looking the 
stranger in front of us in the eye, for fear of what we might suggest. We feel even more vulnerable, like “easy targets,” when we’re in in short skirts or low-cut tops, for fear some man on the street might assume we are “asking for it” and force us to do it anyway when we resist. We don’t blame our outﬁ  ts on the weather, our poor fashion sense, or even men — we blame ourselves.
Women are commonly 
taught three things: how to avoid rape, how to ﬁ  ght back during rape and what to do after rape. We avoid darkness and being alone. We carry pep-per spray and walk swiftly. We call 911 and go to a clinic after-ward.
Society has seemingly ac-
cepted the predator/prey rela-tionship: the vulnerable single woman as prey, and the lonely aggressive man as the preda-tor.
Why hasn’t anyone asked 
men to contain themselves? Is it natural to be sexually charged and aggressive? Are men by nature more demanding and violent?
Public decency and deco-
rum can be taught. Men should be told early in their lives not to rape. Maybe there aren’t enough consequences: Ninety-seven percent of rapists will never spend a day in jail, ac-cording to statistics by Rape, Abuse & Incest National Net-work.
Society should make it 
clear that rape is not the vic-tim’s fault. It is the rapist’s. No means no.
If she says no, resists or hesi-
tates, men have to respect that.  
One of the scariest parts of 
rape is that rapists are not usu-ally strangers. About two out of three assaults are committed by someone known to the vic-tim, and 38 percent are a friend or acquaintance.
If she’s drunk and won’t re-
member, respect her and walk away.
Just because you paid for 
her coffee, took her to dinner or bought her a drink does not mean she owes you in sexual favors.   
If you’re unsure whether 
the money you spend on her will equate to sex, then just go Dutch and split the bill.
Chivalry is basically dead 
anyway. There are rapists out there.

One Walmart closed, but the shopping 
won’t stop with the opening of a new store 
Friday.
On Thursday, the Walmart located on 
2649 NW 13th St., which first opened in 1983, closed while a new store, located at 5700 NW 23rd St., opened its doors early this morning.
Walmart spokesman Bill Wertz said the 
company decided to relocate and expand the new store to meet customer demands.
“This way they can have a grocery store 
along with general merchandise, so they can do all of their shopping in one place,” he said.
Laura D’Spain, spokeswoman for Mitch-
ell Communications Group, which represents Walmart, said the new store will have about 300 employees.
She said employees from the old North-
west 13th Street store can transfer to the new location. She said the new store will hire 70 new employees.A grand opening for the store will begin 
at 7:30 a.m. The new location will have a Sub-way restaurant as well as a nail and hair sa-lon.
“We really like to make our stores as con-
venient as possible,” Wertz said.
Along with the store opening, Regional 
Transit System will also open its first official Park-N-Ride facility on the store’s parking lot Monday.
Students and residents will have the op-
tion of leaving their car in the parking lot and taking bus Route 8 to UF or Shands at UF, said RTS spokesman Chip Skinner.
Skinner said 43 parking spots will be avail-
able for use.
“This is a great benefit for commuters, 
especially those right outside of Gainesville who work at UF or Shands because they can save money and save the time spent looking for a parking space,” he said in a statement. “This also benefits Walmart because when they come back to pick up their car, they are likely to stop inside and purchase whatever they might need.”8, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 2013

About 14 percent said they partied for six or more hours each week
The number of freshmen who 
partied in their senior year of high 
school has also gone down.
About 70 percent of freshmen 
spent some time partying weekly during their senior year of high school in 2009. That number has been decreasing each year, and about 63 percent were reported in 2012.“Considering it’s your last year 
of high school and you’re with your friends for the last time, I guess it’s pretty normal,” said Cameron Sna-vely , a 19-year-old UF exploratory science and engineering freshman.
Meanwhile, about 14 percent of 
freshmen said they spent six or more hours a week partying, which is a decrease from 63 percent in 1987.
Nonetheless, The Princeton Re-
view continuously ranks UF as one of the top 10 party schools. Last year, UF ranked No. 9 but was bumped up to No. 6 for 2013.
Even though Houston doesn’t 
party much, he feels the effects of UF’s high ranking.
“I work 3 a.m. shifts, and I get the 
bar rush, and the party scene hits me hard,” he said about his job at Jimmy John’s.
UF is making an effort to educate 
students about alcohol use. Begin-ning in 2010, all incoming freshmen and transfer students were required to complete the Alcohol e-CHECK-UP TO GO assessment before they were allowed to register for classes.GatorWell’s Core Alcohol & Drug 
Survey , released in 2011, surveyed 678 UF undergraduate students. It reported that about 60 percent of underage students consumed alco-hol in the previous 30 days.
“I think there’s more people that 
drink who just aren’t saying it,” said Kayla Zobel, an 18-year-old UF ex-ploratory science and engineering freshman. “But still [that] is still pretty high for underage drinking.”

UF’s College of Public Health 
& Health Professions, Health-
Street and Athlete Brain have teamed up to offer free baseline concussion tests to Gainesville children and teenagers.
The tests, funded by a grant 
from Health IMPACTS for Florida, will allow physicians to study concussion-like symp-toms for children aged 9 to 18 years old.
The tests will run from noon 
to 4 p.m. Saturday and Feb. 2 at HealthStreet, 2401 SW Archer Road.
Aliyah Snyder, a UF gradu-
ate student and founder of Ath-lete Brain, said supervisors will administer Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 2 tests, which will assess a patient’s balance, coordination and memory on a grading scale. It will also check a patient for concussion symp-toms, such as dizziness, nausea and headaches.
Once a test is complete, par -ents can take the results to their physician, Snyder said.
“If the child has a concussion 
in the future, that SCAT2 result can really help the doctor make a diagnostic decision about whether or not there is impair -
ment,” she said.
Satur -
day’s event evolves from Concussion Awareness Day , which 
was held last year at 
HealthStreet’s Northeast Waldo Road location, said Noni Gra-ham, HealthStreet project coor -
dinator.
“That event was more so just 
to educate the community and to educate the kids on concus-sions,” she said.

Raquel Bicknell said she thinks 
the girls of Delta Zeta can drop it 
really low.
Bicknell, a 20-year-old nursing 
sophomore and recycling commit-tee chair for Delta Zeta Sorority, is looking for ways to win the How Low Can You Go? 2013 Water Chal-lenge.
UF’s Office of Sustainability and 
the Alachua County Environmental Protection Department are coordi-nating the challenge, said Laurel Nesbit, program assistant at the Of-fice of Sustainability.
The sorority house that reduces 
the most amount of water from Feb-ruary to March 18 will win a $500 donation to the philanthropy of its choice. Nesbit said Blue Springs and Ginnie Springs will be making the donation.
The purpose of the water chal-
lenge, she said, is to raise aware-ness about how water usage is di-rectly related to the water quality in springs and rivers.
The 13 houses competing will 
have their water usage measured every week. 
Bicknell said she thinks winning 
the challenge will boil down to the time, temperature and number of showers that are taken in the house every day.
Nesbit said the Office of Sustain-
ability’s first goal is to educate the sororities, but its ultimate goal is to pull in more students.

The city of Gainesville is accepting applications for 
its Spring citizens’ academy program, designed to teach 
residents about the inner-workings of local government and city management.
The Gainesville 101: the Spring 2013 Citizens’ Acad-
emy begins March 13 and will be held at various loca-tions throughout the city from 8:30 a.m. to noon for six consecutive Wednesdays, ending April 17.
Residents interested in participating in the program 
can go to the city’s website and fill out a registration form.
Enrollment is limited to 30 people, and reservations 
will be made on a first-come, first-served basis, accord-ing to a city press release.
If space is unavailable, residents who registered will be notified and put on a waiting list for the next citi-zens’ academy.
“We actually kind of have rolling registration,” said 
Laura Rawson, communications and marketing assis-tant for the city.
The program is open to any interested resident, as 
well as students, she said. Past participants range from college students to retirees to home-schooled children.
Rawson said participants should expect to learn 
about city departments and how they work.
“It helps them figure out how to navigate city gov-
ernment a little easier,” she said.City accepts registration for academy

Ole Miss guard Marshall Hen-
derson has earned a reputation for 
more than his scoring. 
Henderson, who has averaged 
a Southeastern Conference-best 21.3 points per game  in league play, has become infamous for his controversial on-court antics. 
As the buzzer sounded in Ole 
Miss’ 63-61 victory against Auburn on Saturday, Henderson taunted the Tigers student section.. 
During Ole Miss’ 87-74 home 
loss to Kentucky on Tuesday, Hen-derson argued with Rebels coach Andy Kennedy on the sideline and at one point threw ice cubes into the Ole Miss student section. 
Under the 6-foot-2 JUCO trans-
fer’s leadership, Ole Miss (17-3, 6-1 SEC) is off to its best start in program history. 
“Every player is different,” 
point guard Scottie Wilbekin said. “I don’t like to be like that. That’s not my style, but every player can have his own style.”
Junior forward Will Yeguete 
added: “We play with a lot of en-ergy and emotion in the game. Sometimes, you do things you don’t realize you do until after. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.”
No. 4 Florida (17-2, 7-0 SEC) will 
look to contain Henderson when it hosts No. 16 Ole Miss on Saturday night at 7 in the O’Connell Center. 
Henderson has been a dynamic 
scorer this season but is a volume shooter, shooting 38 percent from the field and 34.9 percent from behind the arc. He averages 14.6 field goal attempts per game and has taken 25.9 percent of the Reb-els’ shots in SEC play. 
Henderson gets to the free 
throw line often, making 85.3 per -cent of his 5.1 attempts per con-test. As a deep threat, he thrives in catch-and-shoot situations when coming off of staggered screens.“He’s got great feet,” coach 
Billy Donovan said. “In terms of coming off screens, he can get his feet down, get them set. He’s got the ability to kind of get himself squared up pretty quickly.”

Gators to face SEC’s top scorer

Florida baseball was a sure 
thing last season. 
As was Austin Maddox clos-
ing with games on the line.
He started the year with 
eight scoreless outings. Mad-
dox finished with a 2.44 ERA and 12 saves.
Now he has moved on to 
professional baseball, and Flor -
ida needs to find a closer. 
Candidates include sopho-
mores Justin Shafer and Johnny Magliozzi, as well as juniors Daniel Gibson and Keenan Kish.
“I love being in those situ-
ations having to close out games,” Shafer said. “I love pressure situations. If they ask me to do it, I’ll do the best I can.”
Coach Kevin O’Sullivan had 
a number of relievers at his dis-posal late in games in 2012. The formula never changed.
Starters Hudson Randall, 
Brian Johnson and Jonathan Crawford gave way to a domi-nant bullpen. Greg Larson and Steven Rodriguez then set the table for Maddox.
Roles were defined last sea-
son. With a young group of pitchers, the third starter spot open and a void at closer, roles have yet to be determined.
What is certain are veterans 
like Gibson and Kish will be leaned on heavily . O’Sullivan said he wants a competitor on the mound closing out games. 
With two weeks until the season opener against Duke on Feb. 15, a variety of pitchers are competing to be the guy to take the mound in the ninth frame.
“There’s guys here that are 
ready to step up into those roles and ready to take advantage of the opportunities,” Gibson said.
Shafer splits time on field: 
Don’t expect to see Shafer un-leash his arm in a scrimmage anytime soon.
With an increased pitching 
role, the versatile sophomore is more careful.
“I just take it easy throwing-
wise since I’ll be pitching more, so I don’t throw as much in practice,” he said.
Shafer arrived at Florida as 
an infielder from Lake Wales High. He moved to the out-field after centerfielder Tyler Thompson suffered a torn ACL during the opening weekend of conference play in March.
“He hadn’t played a whole 
lot of outfield,” O’Sullivan said. “I thought he got better as the season wore on. This year, he is totally different. He is a really good defender.”
At the plate, he hit .284 
while batting at the bottom of the lineup. His 44 starts last sea-son are tied for second among returning players.
He’ll be in the middle of the 
lineup once the season starts. Shafer expects more off-speed pitches from opposing pitch-ers, but a year in the SEC and a summer in the Cape Cod Florida weighing 
options at closer
� THE GATORS WERE HELD SCORE-
LESS FOR MORE THAN 6 MINUTES IN THE SECOND HALF.
PHILLIP HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer 
Finding consistent offense has been prob-
lematic for the Gators during Southeastern 
Conference play.Thursday was no different. Florida was held scoreless for more than 6 
minutes in the second half, watching its lead evaporate and its losing streak continue.
Missouri used Florida’s late offensive 
struggles to hand the Gators their fifth con-secutive loss, a 69-64 defeat in Mizzou Are-na.
“We’re digging ourselves a hole, and 
we’re making it really, really hard (to win games),” coach Amanda Butler said. Leading 49-44 with 11:52 remaining in the 
second half, the Gators failed to score for the next 6:03. Missouri (14-8, 3-5 SEC) capital-
ized with a 14-0 run to take a 58-49 lead late in the contest.
Florida recov-
ered from its offen-
sive drought to tie the game at 64 with 1:33 remaining. 
However, Missouri senior Sydney Crafton, who finished with 13 points, scored on consecutive possessions to give the Ti-gers a 68-64 lead with less than a minute to go in the game.
UF did not respond.“They made some plays and hit some 
shots,” Butler said.
“We didn’t.”The five-game losing streak is Florida’s

UF Women’s 
Bask etballSee HOOPS, PA ge 15
See NOTeS, PA ge 15
See MISSOURI, PA ge 15The Gators have successfully limited volume 
shooters this season.
Missouri point guard Phil Pressey and Texas A&M 
guard Elston Turner, who each average roughly 12 
shots per game, went a combined 2 of 17 from the field with six points against UF.
Wilbekin said he plans to chase Henderson off 
screens like he did with Turner. 
“You just have to stay up on him and always be 
ready,” Wilbekin said.
Henderson has proven clutch in key situations. 
Down three points against Vanderbilt on Jan. 15, he drilled a desperation heave at the buzzer to send the game into overtime. In extra time, he scored three more points as the Rebels cruised to an 89-79 victory. 
But Ole Miss has scoring options besides Hender -
son. Senior forwards Murphy Holloway and Regi-nald Buckner have provided inside scoring for the 
Rebels, tallying a combined 24.3 points per contest.
Holloway averages a 
double-double for the Reb-
els with 14.6 points and an SEC-high 10.3 rebounds. 
Donovan said Ole Miss is spaced well on offense 
because opposing teams have to account for both the three-point line and the post. 
“When they beat you off the dribble, that creates 
all sorts of problems,” Donovan said. “There’s a rea-son they’re 6-1 in the league.”FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

With the Southeastern Confer -
ence Championships less than two 
months away, coach Rhonda Faehn has constructed versatile lineups. 
The different combinations have 
paid off. 
“The entire season before SEC 
[Championships], regionals and na-tionals, it’s the opportunity for our athletes to learn, to grow, adapt and to become stronger competitors,” Faehn said. 
Freshman Bianca Dancose-Giam-
battisto was given a chance to learn against Auburn last Friday . 
Replacing All-American Alaina 
Johnson, who sat out with a sore back, on uneven bars against the Ti-gers, Dancose-Giambattisto turned in a 9.925 in her college debut. 
Despite performing an untested 
dismount, her score matched John-son’s 2011 mark as the highest score posted in a bars lineup debut.
“When she competed elite for 
Canada, she had a different dis-mount and we told her [the double layout] was something she needed to learn, and she did,” Faehn said. 
“So to come out and not only do something new, be in the pressure of the lineup and stick (the landing), I think that said a lot for her and her mental toughness.”
Florida is averaging 9.82 on bars. 
Dancose-Giambattisto’s sample size may be small, but it speaks volumes to the depth of Florida’s rotations. 
“I want them to be sure that when 
they put me in the lineup that I can hit the routine, stick it every time 
and always go for 
the 10,” Dancose-G i a m b a t t i s t o said. 
Faehn said 
Johnson might be out for more than several meets, which should free up space on the 
uneven bars rotation  and in other events for Dancose-Giambattisto to-night at Arkansas. 
So far, Faehn has been impressed 
with Dancose-Giambattisto’s abili-ties. 
“She’s a natural bars swinger,” 
Faehn said.
“She’s a beautiful bars swinger 
with incredible extension and toe point.”
Sophomore Rachel Spicer made her balance beam debut competing alongside Dancose-Giambattisto on Jan. 13. She recorded a 9.125 despite making a mistake on her layout mid-routine. 
Spicer, like Dancose-Giambattis-
to, subbed in for the injured John-son. 
Sophomore Kytra Hunter, who 
was named SEC Gymnast of the Week, has taken notice of her team-mates’ readiness.
“Putting the new faces out there 
in the different lineups and just ad-justing to the new lineups quick just shows us just how mentally strong we are,” Hunter said. 
The Gators travel to Fayetteville, 
Ark., to defend their No. 1 ranking against the Razorbacks.
Dancose-Giambattisto may find 
time again on uneven bars.
But if last week was any indica-
tion, Dancose-Giambattisto may not learn where she will be competing until tonight. 
“[Faehn] told me actually the day 
of the competition that I was going to compete,” Dancose-Giambattisto said.
“Just going out there and doing 
an awesome routine felt really good and boosted my confidence.”
Freshman shines on bars in debut

missOURi , from page 15League prepared him well.
“The biggest thing about be-
ing here one year is knowing 
what to expect,” Shafer said. “You see a lot of people you are going to face hitting-wise, and as a freshman, you don’t know what to expect pitching-wise. You get here, and it is kind of overwhelming with everyone throwing 90 mph, and you are like, ‘Wow,’ every day , seeing that. Getting used to that, you know what to expect everyday in and out with SEC pitching.”
Third starter spot up for grabs:  
Projected first-round picks fill the first two slots in Florida’s 
starting rotation.
Jonathon Crawford and 
Karsten Whitson continue where last year’s starting staff left off. The two earned second- and third-team preseason All-American honors from Baseball America on Thursday . 
UF’s third starter has yet to 
be selected.
“We just don’t know who it 
is yet,” O’Sullivan said. “Prob-ably by next weekend we will have a much better idea. There are some guys vying for those weekend spots right now, but we still have a few more scrim-mages to go to confirm that.”

George scored 13 points,

from Dec. 29, 2006 to Feb. 11, 2007, a 
span that eventually cost then-coach Carolyn Peck her job. 
“We’re just looking for answers 
right now,” junior Vicky McIntyre said.
“We’ve tried everything.”Jennifer George finished with her 
most productive game since first suf-fering a dislocated shoulder against LSU on Jan. 6. George scored 13 points and grabbed six rebounds. 
McIntyre added 12 points off the 
bench, equaling her career-best mark with the Gators. 
Florida (13-9, 2-6 SEC) weathered 
an early storm from sophomore Mor-gan Eye and the Tigers.
Eye checked into the game for the 
first time with 14:52 remaining in the first half and quickly connected on her first three attempts from behind the arc. 
Eye, the only player in the nation 
with at least 80 three-pointers enter-ing Thursday, hit her fourth 4 minutes later while freshman January Miller was simultaneously called for a foul away from the ball. 
Missouri used the momentum to 
take a 32-20 lead with 4:40 remaining in the first half, but the Gators fought back. 
Florida closed the half on a 14-0 
run to take a 34-32 lead into the break before struggling in the closing min-utes of the contest.
 “We’ve got another SEC ball game 
in [three] days,” Butler said. “We’ve got to dry our tears and get in there and get ready to battle.”

Like every other game in her 
career, Florida senior midfielder 
Brittany Dashiell had coaches and teammates cheering her on. But on Saturday and Sunday at the Dis-ney Wide World of Sports in Lake Buena Vista, they were cheering for Dashiell from the stands.
Dashiell competed for the U.S. 
lacrosse women’s national team in games against the England national team, Syracuse and Northwestern. 
Dashiell, who was one of five 
college lacrosse players on the squad, finished the weekend with two goals along with one assist over the three games.
In a move to shrink the roster 
size to 18, Dashiell was one of seven players cut this week. Despite not making the final cut for the World Cup, Dashiell was thankful for the experience she gained from playing on the international squad.
“Playing with the U.S. team is 
different from playing with Flor -ida, but I definitely learned a lot,” Dashiell said. “It’s made me much better ... and hopefully, I can carry it over for Florida.”
Earning a spot on the U.S. 
national team has been one of Dashiell’s goals since she arrived at Florida. Her first tryout came as a freshman.
“I didn’t really know what I was 
getting into, because I just went there for the experience to see what it would be like more than anything else,” Dashiell said.
She didn’t make it that year but 
said the experience helped her this time around.
“I’m glad I did it because I knew 
what to expect when I tried out this year,” Dashiell said. “The experi-ence of playing college ball has re-ally made me a much better player and made me more prepared for the tryouts.”
Dashiell was the first Florida la-
crosse player to earn a spot on the U.S. national team’s 25-player ros-ter. UF coach Amanda O’Leary is proud of Dashiell and excited to see how Dashiell’s international expe-rience will help her teammates.
“To have a representative on 
the U.S. program is wonderful,” O’Leary said.
“It’s great experience for her 
playing with the best of the best, and she brings that out every time she comes out for Florida.”
Former U.S. national team play-
er and current Florida assistant coach Erica LaGrow can vouch for the benefits of playing on the inter -
national scene.
Drawing on her own experience 
on the international level from 2007 to 2012, LaGrow said the competi-tion the U.S. squad faces helps both the players and the coaches im-prove.
LaGrow noticed Dashiell’s game 
pace has increased since playing for the U.S. team.

best players in the world, under -
standing their styles,” LaGrow said. “A lot of them on the national team are coaches, so you learn different coaching styles, get new ideas.”

The final step is just ahead.Today The Florida Alligator is ex-
pected to take the last step making it The Independent Florida Alligator.
Sixty-five years of university 
control will be signed away when last-minute contract negotiations be-tween the UF and the new corpora-tion are finalized.
In the Tigert Hall offices of the 
university attorney, the charter of Campus Communications, Inc. -- the new Independent Alligator -- was signed Wednesday by five of the seven board members.
The contract and charter together 
will put into effect the recommen-dations of the President’s Ad Hoc Committee on Student Publications chaired by Professor Hugh Cunning-ham.
the new corporation’s general 
manager Tony Kendizor said that he plans to make ends meet from in-creased advertising revenues and a 15 per cent reduction in student sala-ries that will be solved by not replac-ing some employees that will leave.
Alligator Editor Randy Bellows 
said, that “full student salaries are critical to the Alligator’s financial situation. I look forward to indepen-dence with the student salaries cov-ered.”
The contract will give the new 
corporation $35,000 to pay the sala-ries of full-time Alligator employees until June 30. The new corporation will also get to collect the unpaid bills for the month of January, a fig-ure which is lower than the $55,000 expected because of a decline in na-tional advertising.
UF President Stephen O’Connell 
said that the university “will make up the difference, and that difference could be in the payment of student salaries” so that the new corporation will receive the expected $55,000.
the contract also gives The Al-
ligator the use of its equipment and offices until Sept. 1, 1973, when The Alligator will move off campus in re-turn for providing The Alligator free to the university community at least three times a week during the winter and spring terms, and once during the summer term.
The Alligator will also continue 
to print the “Page of Record” and the “Campus Crier” in return for the use of the Reitz Union office and equip-ment.
Kendizor said the Alligator cor -
poration failed to secure a written pledge in the contract from the ad-ministration that it would not publish a competing campus publication.
“The state cannot legally waive 
that right,” said Kendizor. “I talked it over with Dick Jones (Gainesville Mayor) who was inclined to agree. So I have Rae Weimer’s (UF adminis-tration representative) word for what it’s worth” that the UF administra-tion will not publish a competing newspaper.
The officers of the board for the 
new corporation are Sharkey, the ed-itor of the High Springs Herald; Vice Chairman Kevin Davey , a UF law student; and secretary Tim Condon, The Alligator’s managing editor.
Also serving on the board is Ken-dizor, former assistant manager of the Hub bookstore, Ed Cornwell, The Alligator’s advertising manager; Al-ligator Editor Randy Bellows, and The Alligator’s student business manager, Mike Blocker.
Blocker and Bellows did not sign 
the charter because they are under 21. The law prevents minors from signing a corporation charter as sub-scribers. This however, will not pre-vent Bellows and Blocker from being held legally responsible for what The Alligator prints, as members of the corporation.
According to the charter, “the cor -
poration’s major function will be to publish, daily or otherwise, a news-paper containing the news of the stu-dents, faculty and staff of the UF.”
The charter will become official 
when it is filed with the secretary of state’s office in Tallahassee.
The charter requires that “a ma-
jority of one of board of directors at anytime shall be elected from among the undergraduate and graduate stu-dent body of the UF.”
The charter also states that the 
board of directors shall include the general manager, the assistant gen-eral manager, the student business manager, the student editor, the stu-dent managing editor, a professional journalist and a graduate student with a journalism background who is not employed by The Alligator cor -
poration. Changes in the charter re-quire a majority of the full seven man board to be made.
The charter also states that if the 
corporation dissolves, all of its assets will go to “the use and benefit of the UF College of Journalism.”
Alligator gains independence, 
contract with UF near completion
