As Brianna Ahik stood six people deep in line at the 
UF Computing Help Desk, the journalism junior grew 
more and more frustrated.
“I installed it,” said Ahik, 23. “I still can’t f--king get 
on.”
She turned to her friend, Mike Maguire.“I’m getting frustrated,” Ahik said. “I have an on-
line class.”
“Do you have a Mac also?” Maguire said. “I think it 
may be a Mac problem.”
Ahik shook her head no.The Computing Help Desk at the Hub was swamped 
Thursday with students who were having trouble con-necting to UF’s new wireless network.

Members of a UF fraternity assisted 
University Police ofﬁ  cers in the arrest of 
an Ocala man who allegedly broke into the 
fraternity house mother’s bedroom early 
Thursday morning.
Police charged Solomon Jamel Taylor 
III, 23, of Ocala, with unarmed burglary of 
a dwelling, a felony and trespassing, a mis-
demeanor.
At 2:13 a.m. Thursday, Patricia Arnold, 
50, was sleeping when Taylor entered her bedroom through an unlocked balcony 
door at the Kappa Alpha Order fraternity 
house at 5 Fraternity Row, according to the UPD arrest report.  
Arnold’s bedroom is attached to the 
house, and Taylor climbed on a fenced deck, which was 5 feet from the ground, to get onto the balcony, according to the report.
When Taylor entered the room, Arnold’s 
maltipoo, Milo, started barking and woke Arnold up.
Arnold said she saw Taylor standing 
several feet away from her bed.
“I froze for a second,” 
she said. “It didn’t seem real, so I screamed.”
According to the re-
port, Taylor ﬂ  ed from the room. 
Arnold said she 
grabbed a robe and went upstairs to tell fra-ternity brothers what had happened.
Several fraternity brothers went outside 
and patrolled around the house, Arnold Frat brothers assist in arrestSEE INTERNET, PAGE 4

plea included two counts of mak-
ing child pornography, 15 counts 
of interstate extortion and seven 
counts of internet stalking.
Gunn also was accused of 
working another scam in which he 
posed as the new kid in town on so-
cial media sites such as Facebook, 
and once he gained the girls’ trust through fake social media profiles he would solicit embarrassing in-
formation about them, according 
to Beck’s statement. Gunn would 
ask for explicit photographs and threaten to make available the em-barrassing information if the girls 
refused, it said.
Authorities allege that Gunn’s 
actions took place from 2009 un-
til 2012. On March 20, 2012, FBI agents executed a federal search 
warrant on Gunn’s house. They 
said they seized a cellphone and 
a laptop computer containing im-ages and videos of child pornog-raphy.
Beck’s statement said Gunn 
had obtained explicit photos of young girls in numerous states, including Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.
The Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation said it is continuing to work to identify any additional victims in other states including Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Cali-fornia.
Based on his guilty plea, Gunn 
faces no less than 25 years and as much as 35 years in federal prison, Beck’s statement said. It added that he could be ordered to spend the rest of his life on supervised release.

Ala. man pleads guilty to            producing child porn
MONTGOMERY , Ala. — An 
Alabama man who was accused of posing online as pop star Jus-tin Bieber while urging young girls to send him explicit photos of themselves pleaded guilty Thursday to producing child pornography, authorities an-nounced.
Christopher Patrick Gunn, 
31, of Montgomery, promised young girls free tickets and back-stage passes to a Bieber concert 
if they would agree to send him 
inappropriate photos or web-
cam transmission of themselves, authorities said.
A statement released Thurs-
day by U.S. Attorney George L. Beck in Montgomery said Gunn used chat rooms and other so-cial media outlets to threaten hundreds of girls ages 9 to 16 throughout the United States and abroad over a period of more than two years as part of a far-ranging “online sextortion scheme” that included posing as Bieber and other ruses.
“These child predators irrep-
arably damage the children they victimize,” Beck said in the news release. “The scope of this defen-dant’s exploitation of children is staggering; he not only preyed upon children in our commu-nity, but in communities across the United States.”

fulfill his or her duties, the pro tem-
pore must step up.
“This to me is a fulfillment of 
those duties,” Harrison said.
After the meeting, Harrison said 
he hadn’t decided if he would keep Price’s temporary committees on 
anti-hate and sustainability. Tem-
porary committees normally dis-solve when the Senate president’s term is up.
Harrison said he is excited for 
the new term.
“I think it will be an easier tran-
sition,” he said.
The Senate also elected Yeffet to 
take over Harrison’s position as the Senate president pro tempore. Yef-fet beat Students Party Sen. Morgan Vollrath 40 to 11. The newly elected Harrison abstained from voting.
While presenting to the Senate, 
Vollrath said voting a minority sen-ator to the second-highest position in the Senate would demonstrate 
the body’s bipartisanship.
However, senators raised ques-
tions about Vollrath’s inexperience 
within the Senate. He was voted in during the spring elections and is 
a member of the Rules and Ethics 
Committee.  
Yeffet spoke about his time on 
the Replacement and Agenda Com-
mittee. He said he was the second-
longest-standing member on the committee. Harrison was the other.
Yeffet’s new position means he 
will lead that committee. He is al-
lowed to keep his spot on the Judi-
ciary Committee, but he’s not sure if he will.
“I feel great,” Yeffet said after the meeting. “I’m looking forward to the next six weeks.”
Harrison and Yeffet will serve 
in their new positions for six weeks until Student Government elections on Oct. 2 and Oct. 3.
After the meeting, Wilson said 
she fears the rest of the term will be a “lame duck” period in which nothing gets accomplished.
“I don’t think it’s the best for the 
students,” she said.

said. They found Taylor hiding behind a tree and chased 
after him.
The men caught Taylor near the Lambda Chi Alpha 
fraternity house and held him until UPD officers arrived.
Police arrested Taylor after Arnold identified him as 
the man who broke into her bedroom, according to the report.
At the time of the break-in, Taylor had an active tres-
pass warning, preventing him from being on UF campus following an incident several years ago.
In 2009, UPD arrested Taylor on misdemeanor bat-
tery and stalking charges after he was accused of trying to touch a Santa Fe College student in his groin area while 
they were driving on Hull Road, according to court re-
cords.
According to the report, Taylor has no affiliation with 
UF or the fraternity.
UPD spokesman Maj. Brad Barber praised the collabo-
ration between officers and fraternity members in Tay-lor’s arrest.
“One of the things this incident illustrates is working 
together as a campus community, we were able to suc-
cessfully make an apprehension and arrest,” he said.
Police booked Taylor in Alachua County Jail at 4:46 
a.m. Thursday with a $20,000 bond, which he met late 
that evening.

Mac users experienced 
more trouble than PCs
efficiently access the Internet while on campus, according to Alligator 
archives. The new system included combined resources and required students to update an anti-virus software.
As part of the change, UFW, the former on-campus wireless sys-
tem, and DHW, the Internet service for dorms, combined this fall into 
one service.
Nick Robbie, a tech support staff for the Computing Help Desk, 
said students have been coming in since 8 a.m. Wednesday , and the 
lines have been long ever since.
Ahik said she’s had problems connecting to the Internet for a 
month. Now she spent her second day of classes waiting in line at the Hub.
Maguire, a 20-year-old UF sophomore, said he spoke to Mac own-
ers who also have the same problem.
He said he tried to reconfigure his wireless connection twice al-
ready , but whenever he tried to access Google, he’d have the same problem many students were facing: being redirected to the wireless network website and being told to connect to the UF wireless system again.
“A lot of people don’t know they need anti-virus,” Robbie said.The line has been filled with Mac and PC owners alike, but most of 
them have been Mac owners. For Mac owners, the auto configuration setting depends on the type of operating system, such as Leopard or Mountain Lion, he said.
Some students like Ahik decided to use the computers in the Hub 
to get online before figuring out what was wrong with their laptops. For those students in line, the wait can feel frustrating.
“I don’t want to stand in this long line,” Ahik said, the line snaking 
behind her. “I could be eating lunch right now.”Internet , from page 1Yeffet will fill Harrison’s previous position

Whether it’s by attending election aware-
ness campaigns or by registering to vote, UF 
students can become engaged in the upcoming presidential election.
The Politic365 College Convention Bus Tour, 
an 11-college and university tour in conjunction with the Republican and Democratic national conventions, will hold a rally from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Monday in the Reitz Union Rion Ballroom. Students will voice their opinions on topics such as jobs, health care and immigration, according to a UF news release.
Students will also have access to a Politic365 
speaker panel and representatives from politi-
cally engaged organizations like the College Re-
publicans and College Democrats.
On Aug. 31, “Bring it to the Table,” a commu-
nity engagement campaign, will be on Turling-ton Plaza from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. The program, sponsored by the Bob Graham Center for Public Service, will allow students to share their politi-cal beliefs in an effort to encourage tolerance and discussion, according to a UF news release.The tour is attending the Republican Nation-
al Convention and will stop in Gainesville on its way to the Democratic National Convention in North Carolina, said Shelby Taylor, digital and communications director at the Graham Cen-ter.
If students have not yet registered to vote, 
they can do so through TurboVote, Taylor said.
Students can also change their registration 
county to Alachua County or request an absen-
tee ballot from their county of permanent resi-
dence. 
Andrew Arons, a 19-year-old telecommuni-
cation sophomore, requested an absentee bal-lot from his hometown of Boca Raton using the TurboVote link on the Integrated Student Infor -
mation System. 
About 1,500 students have either completed 
an absentee ballot request or registered since the 
program launched this summer, Taylor said.
“With students back on campus,” she said, 
“we’ll really start to see a huge increase in those 
numbers.”

Pop-Tarts are officially Gator bait.
UF is one of the five universities Kel-
logg Co. has partnered with to launch limited-edition Pop-Tarts. ESPN report-er Darren Rovell broke the breakfast-
pastry news on Twitter on Monday.
University of Florida Florida Gators’ 
Strawberry Pop-Tarts will be on local 
shelves early next month, according to Dick Podiak, Pop-Tarts marketing di-rector.
The Gators Pop-Tarts have white ic-
ing with the iconic Gators logo printed onto them. They’re priced the same as 
other Pop-Tart varieties’. They can also 
be purchased at PopTartsWorld.com, according to Podiak.
Printed Fun Pop-Tarts will also be 
available in Tar Heel Berry, University of Georgia Bulldog Berry, University of Michigan Go Blue Strawberry and Ar -kansas Razorbacks Razorback Red.
“If I was to eat a Pop-Tart, I would 
try it, just because it’s Gators,” said 21-year-old electrical engineering senior Brittany Finch.
Some UF students weren’t so sure.“It’s cute, but I won’t eat them,” said 
material science junior Brandy Mobley , 22. She said she’d prefer the Pop-Tarts were s’mores-flavored because the strawberry ones have too much crust.
Finch agreed and suggested a way to 
get students all over campus eating the toaster treats.
“They should give free samples,” 
she said.

30 TOTAL VOTESWhile on break, students tend to block out the 
world in favor of more malaise and relaxing 
realities. Fortunately for nearly all Americans, 
the fear of an artillery strike on a hospital, mechanized 
assaults on suburban neighborhoods and the loss of an entire generation in a family is a distant and abstract notion.
However, this does not and should not abdicate the 
American public’s conscience from the atrocities taking place in Syria. The millennial generation — those who range in age from 16 to 25 — is by far the most electroni-
cally connected in terms of global communication. Now 
is the time for us to put this vehicle into action.
Last semester, I wrote a column imploring students 
to take action so we can keep Syria off of a macabre list 
that includes the likes of Rwanda, Sarajevo, Srebrenica 
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. With a death 
toll in excess of 20,000 and evidence suggesting the bru-tal regime of Bashar al-Assad has committed atrocities amounting to war crimes, the window for the possibil-ity of avoiding mass atrocity crimes has now passed. 
What remains is the opportunity for swift cessation and 
resolution. But the current geopolitical climate would suggest that this secondary follow-up objective may fall out of reach as well.
Here is where we must take a stand.The case for intervention in Syria would be first and 
foremost humanitarian. In contrast with how the U.S. handled Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom, justifi-cation for an intervention could be mounted solely on 
humanitarian grounds, without needing a weapons-of-
mass-destruction goose chase.
Thanks to the proliferation of online tools such as 
blogs, YouTube and Twitter, firsthand looks at the vio-lence and depravity in Syria are easily accessible.
Those who claim a non-interventionist policy can 
no longer stand by the sidelines. The U.S. and other al-lies have already intervened. Now there is only a ques-tion of to what extent we will continue to intervene. 
Non-lethal aid, medical 
supplies and diplomatic measures are all forms of 
external intervention into the Syrian crisis.
And to the fiscal conservatives, even if our president 
seems to you to be a radical socialist, and no matter 
how bad our own fiscal crisis may seem, we never will 
face anything like indiscriminate air strikes on civilian targets. To those who say the risk of your grandchild 
having to pay an extra 5 percent in taxes in 50 years to 
pay off a national debt means we must not help people 
half a world away who are truly suffering, remember 
this: At the very least you can still talk that way about your progenies’ future. Hundreds of families in Syria 
do not have that ability because of the loss of an entire 
generation.
I’ve said it before: If we remain comatose and act 
complacent, we will become morally culpable. We still have time to right the course of history. This reinvigo-
rated call for action is not a call for war or invasion, but 
rather to help the Syrians suffering at the hands of their own brutal government.
You should be outraged and angry at such senseless 
slaughter and the subsequent lack of committed action. By understanding the daily hell Syrian children are ex-periencing, you will see how strong the justification is for continued intervention. Your calls should become stronger and more passionate the more you learn of 
their suffering.
And if our peaceful intervention tactics fail, and the 
need for direct military intervention becomes a poten-
tial reality, the mere fact that steps were taken to under -
stand the issue before the onset of war will make for a 
more honest and intelligent discussion.

Columnist calls millenial generation to actionWelcome (back) to Gainesville, folks! Sorry for all of the 
global warming during the summer, but we’re sure we’ll 
have a milder fall. Even though the weather will be nice, 
do yourselves a favor, and don’t expect much from the 
football season. Expect a light chance of touchdowns and a 
downpour of yellow flags.
So now it’s time for the sorry-for-the-abrupt-transition-
but-we-don’t-want-to-rush edition of...
Darts & Laurels
First off, we’d like to send a possible thank you to our 
good buddy Isaac for threatening the Republican National Convention in Tampa next week ... Tropical Storm Isaac, 
that is. That’s why we’re giving a good the-RNC-needed-a-
shake-up LAUREL to Tropical Storm Isaac. 
Fingers crossed that he’s not late to the Grand Ole Par -
ty!
Also, we’re throwing a leave-our-puppets-alone DART  
at the RNC. Andrea Davis, the spokeswoman for the Tam-pa Police Department, said that protesters aren’t allowed to bring puppets, because “their heads have been used to hide weapons and other matter, fecal matter.” 
Although you won’t see them in the crowds outside, 
you can still see plenty of puppets who are full of s--t on stage.
We give a Why-Canada!-we-hate-your-“punk”-“rock”-
bands DART to Canada for allowing Avril Lavigne and 
Chad Kroeger to get engaged. Come on, guys. We trusted the Great White North, and this is what they did to us. 
That being said, we can’t wait to hear “This Photograph 
Is Complic8ted” on the radio.
In other celebrity news, we want to give a you-kept-it-
together-for-so-long LAUREL to Prince Harry. He was re-
cently spotted partying in Las Vegas, um, naked with other naked people. But give the guy a break! It’s gotta be tough 
to be the more attractive (yet still not married) royal. 
Plus, maybe he just wanted to show off the royal           
jewels...
If you’re planning a trip to Scandinavia soon, bring ex-
tra underwear. This warning was brought to you by the re-cipient of our we-don’t-blame-you-for-probably-pooping-
your-pants LAUREL to a driver in Norway who crashed 
into a bear after swerving to avoid hitting a moose in the road. 
Dudes and moose and bears — oh, s--t!South African authorities are giving some of their el-
ephants birth control to help maintain the population. This means that elephants in South Africa have more reproduc-tive freedom than women in Missouri. 
That’s why we give a why-don’t-you-go-on-a-legiti-
mate-date-with-Mike-Huckabee-to-Chick-fil-A DART to 
Todd Akin.
Have a dry and safe weekend, and be sure to check back 
next week!Nolan Kraszkiewicz

it will bring Of Montreal, an indie rock band with psychedel-
ic influences, to the Reitz Union Rion Ballroom on Sept. 25.
The show is free and open to the public. Doors open at 6:30 
p.m. Local band Xylitone will be opening the show.
Of Montreal was selected by RUB Entertainment to per -
form because compared to other national acts the group had 
in mind, it worked out best time-wise and budget-wise, said 
Jessica Watson, codirector of the RUB bands committee.
RUB Entertainment will be paying Of Montreal $12,500 to 
perform.
“Of Montreal is very edgy with costumes and lights dur -
ing their performances,” Watson said. “It’s more of a theatri-cal show than just guitars and drums.”
In honor of the band’s eclectic style, 19-year-old advertis-
ing sophomore Devin Lee plans to arrive to the show decked out in a Native American headdress and glow sticks with his best friend, 19-year-old journalism sophomore Zack Peter -
son.
“It’s going to be a great live show that you probably won’t 
get to see again for free,” Lee said. “When I heard about the show, I started planning my costume.”

Tropical Storm Isaac could im-
pact UF students this weekend but 
probably won’t affect school next week.
As of 11 p.m. Thursday night, 
Isaac was strengthening near Puerto Rico as it moved west-northwest-ward, according to the National Hurricane Center. Isaac’s projected path leads it across Hispaniola and Cuba before swinging into the Gulf of Mexico early next week.David Keellings, a UF geol-
ogy doctoral student who teaches the Extreme Weather course, said Isaac probably won’t threaten Gainesville.
“I don’t expect it’ll be a very se-
vere hurricane, if it’s a hurricane at 
all,” Keellings said.
He said the storm’s track is mov-
ing westward, directing it more to-
ward Tampa and the Republican National Convention but farther away from UF.
Still, UF administration is keep-
ing an eye on Isaac, said university spokesman Steve Orlando.
A UF alert went out Thursday af-
ternoon encouraging students, fac-ulty and staff traveling this weekend to do so carefully.
The last time campus closed for 
severe weather was in 2008 for Trop-
ical Storm Fay , Orlando said, but UF 
won’t hesitate to cancel classes to keep students safe.
“If we have hurricane-force 
winds in Gainesville, there wouldn’t be any question about it,” he said.

A few days before the biggest 
UF medical school test of the year, 
Ray Brown sped 550 miles to Ten-nessee to clear his mind.
That was typical Ray, his 32-
year-old brother Tom Brown said. He was never quite sure where Ray would go next — Haiti to look after people, Iraq to tend to Army vehicles, UF to train to be a doc-tor — but Tom always knew Ray would come home again safely.
Ray, 31, was headed back to 
Florida on June 21, but something 
went wrong.
His car crashed, the metal 
twisting, the glass breaking. He 
was rushed by helicopter to a hos-pital in Chattanooga, Tenn.
There, family watched him 
open his eyes. They saw the blank stare —  the expression of the brain-damaged.
There was a far-off look in his 
eyes, like he was trying to wake up from a dream.
While he fights and slowly re-
covers, his family is facing its own nightmares: dwindling savings, little to no financial help and no insurance.
But they’re far from giving up.
Ray spoke for the first time 
Wednesday. He stood up for the 
first time a few weeks after the ac-
cident. He can squeeze a ball and 
hold his mother’s hand.
His once Superman-like mus-
cles have atrophied, making him look like a mortal again. His curly brown hair and beard are growing in, his facial hair trimmed as oth-ers see fit.
He’s getting better, but the 
progress is slow going.
After being released from Er -
langer Medical Center Monday, 
Ray was taken to St. Augustine 
to stay with his mom. She always had a little room set up for Ray, just in case he decided to visit.
But this time, instead of watch-
ing her boys wrestle in the kitch-en, she’s watching as various ther -
apists help her youngest boy take baby step after baby step toward 
recovery.
  
As Ray’s silver car cruised 
down a Tennessee highway, glint-
ing in the late afternoon sun, the Brown family’s nightmare began.
He was driving back from 
Nashville, Tenn., on Interstate 24. It was about 4 p.m., and he wasn’t far into his trek.
His car drifted out of his lane, 
and he jerked the wheel to fix it. He overcorrected, slamming the right side of the car into a passing semi truck.
Nearby witnesses — one who 
was a doctor and off-duty officer — ran to help him. While the man tended to Ray, a woman found his phone and called Tom and his mother.
“All we knew was he was be-
ing med-flighted to the hospital,” Tom said. “You can only imagine the scenarios you run through in 
your head when you have a loved 
one go through that.”
They drove all day and through 
the night to be by his side.
  
Until this week, Ray’s family 
didn’t know if they’d be able to get 
him into a rehabilitation program. 
He couldn’t stay in the hospital, because he was well enough to be discharged, but his family said he needs intense therapy, both men-tally and physically, if he’s going to improve.
He’ll get medical care provided 
by Veterans Affairs at his mom’s house until a rehab program agrees to take him. For a while, programs wouldn’t take him, be-cause he couldn’t respond to com-mands.
With his recent progress of 
talking sporadically, his family 
is looking into getting him into 
Tampa’s James A. Haley Veter -
ans’ Hospital. If everything goes as planned, Ray could be set to go to the VA in two weeks.
A big hurdle is the money.Ray doesn’t have insurance, 
and he’s all but drained his Med-icaid.
At home, little things like Ray’s 
Ensure shakes add up at about $2 a pop. But long-term care is a whole other matter.
For now, VA-contracted thera-
pists visit Ray regularly, but his family isn’t sure how long they can expect that to last.
“We’re still in the dark in terms 
of what he’ll need and what he’ll get,” Tom said.
  
Before his accident, Ray was 
on his way to UF to take Step 1, a comprehensive science skills test. It is universally known within the 
UF medical school as the most 
important and stressful exam to happen all year, said UF medical student Amy Driebe, 24.
If you don’t pass, you don’t 
advance to the third year of medi-cal school. And how well you do could determine which field you can specialize in.
But friends say Ray wasn’t 
stressing about the exam. The last time 26-year-old UF medical student Benjamin Srivastava saw Ray, he was in Library West, calm amid the chaos of cramming stu-dents.
“I feel now, studying for this 
test, I’m reaching my maximum potential,” he told Strivastava.
Driebe said she ran into Ray 
earlier in the year at Target. While she and most of her medical school friends were bundles of stress, Ray looked relaxed and collected.
“He was just so calm, and like, 
‘This is going to be fine. I have 
complete faith in you,’” she said.
For those who knew Ray’s pen-
chant for meditation and calm 
manner, his answer came as no surprise. Nothing could faze Ray.
She said many of her class-
mates are in shock after learning about his accident and brain dam-age.
“Ray was one of the best peo-
ple I’ve ever met,” she said, paus-ing. “He just had so much in his 
life. He was just going in such an 
amazing direction. It just couldn’t have happened to a nicer per -
son.”
  
Ray’s demeanor wasn’t given 
to him. It was earned.
After high school, he realized 
he needed to make a change in his life, so he followed in his brother’s footsteps and joined the Army, becoming a diesel mechanic and serving in Iraq, his brother said.
Ray kept the details to himself 
— only mentioning fragments of stories of how the ground shook 
during mortar raids — but some-
where in the smoke and sand, he had his awakening.
Tom said Ray came home ma-
ture, focused and ready to plan for the future.
He focused on his health by 
exercising more, meditating and keeping a close watch on what he ate, sometimes testing out pecu-liar diets. His friends would post new concoctions on his Facebook wall, like sugarless cakes.
Soon, he graduated from the 
University of South Florida and was headed to UF’s medical school with dreams of pursuing Doctors Without Borders.
His friends said he was moti-
vated, yet kept his sense of humor. He had an unparalleled ability to dedicate himself to his work while keeping a calm presence.
Since the accident, Ray’s class 
has banded together to get the 
word out about Ray’s condition to 
see if there’s anything that can be done to get him medical help or donations.
“He’s an amazing person,” 
Srivastava said.
They thought he’d be a great 
doctor one day.
When medical students start 
their studies, they expect to be healing strangers. They don’t ex-pect for one of their own to show up in their emergency room or to be on their charts. They belong in lab coats, not paper gowns.
“I think there’s this idea that 
when you go into medical school that you aren’t going to get sick,” 
Driebe said. “We have a hard time 
talking about it.”

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
HOBBS, N.M. — Republican presi-
dential contender Mitt Romney prom-
ised on Thursday to aggressively expand off-shore oil drilling along Vir -
ginia, North Carolina and the Gulf of 
Mexico, changing the subject from so-
cial issues like abortion and Medicare that have dominated the debate in the days before the critical Republican Na-tional Convention.
Speaking to voters in the heart 
of New Mexico’s oil and gas indus-try, Romney declared that his energy plans — which include drilling for oil 
in a federal Alaskan wildlife reserve — 
would create 3 million jobs and more than $1 trillion in new revenue. And he predicted complete “North American energy independence by 2020, a never-realized goal claimed by presidential candidates for decades.”
“That means we produce all the en-
ergy we use in North America,” Rom-
ney said, emphasizing an expansion of 
oil and gas over wind and solar pro-duction. “This is not some pie-in-the-sky kind of thing. This is a real achiev-able objective.”
President Barack Obama did not 
face voters on Thursday. Instead, he deployed a popular former president, Bill Clinton, to help convince a di-
vided electorate that he simply needs 
more time to fix the nation’s struggling economy. Clinton is expected to speak at the Democratic National Conven-tion next month and play a prominent role in the final months before Election Day.
The cornerstone of Romney’s plan 
is opening up more areas for offshore oil drilling, including mid-Atlantic swing states like North Carolina and Virginia, where it is currently banned. He also wants to give states the power to establish all forms of energy produc-tion on federal lands, a significant shift in current policy that could face strong 
opposition in Congress.
Romney specifically cited drilling 
in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife 
Refuge as part of a broad plan to gener -
ate millions of addi-tional barrels of oil each day.
A Romney cam-
paign official later downplayed the comment. The plan 
would revive a longtime Republican goal to allow drilling for oil in the wildlife refuge. Congress has blocked drilling there for more than a quarter-century.
Romney also plans to approve the 
Keystone XL pipeline that has worried environmentalists and would run from Canada to U.S. refineries in Texas. And he is calling for the end of a production tax credit for wind power that is set to expire at the end of the year.Romney promises energy 
independence by 2020

  GREG LUCA
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 Dante Fowler Jr. has only been 
with the Gators since July 2, but he 
has a chance to be a key pass rusher and a regular contributor at the Buck linebacker position. 
  “He certainly looks like he be-
longs,” defensive coordinator Dan Quinn said. “He’s physically strong, and when he’s out there practicing, you certainly say, ‘This guy is ready to help and be a part of our defense, for sure.’”
  Given Florida’s struggles rushing 
the passer and Ronald Powell’s ACL 
tear, a signiﬁ  cant contribution from 
Fowler would be a major boon.  
  A ﬁ  ve-star prospect and the No. 
28 recruit in the nation last year, Fowler seemed like a lock to head to Florida State before ﬂ  ipping his commitment to UF on National Signing Day.
  Since joining the team on the 
practice ﬁ  eld, Fowler has impressed, avoiding the freshman wall that can slow down many newcomers and establishing himself as one of the 
team’s best options at the 
Buck, likely 
behind only Lerentee Mc-
Cray . 
  Although Quinn said last week 
that Fowler was ‘swimming’ like many of the other freshmen, Fowl-er’s motor has never slowed down. 
  “He’s somebody who really 
pushed through and took each day and said, ‘Alright, I’m going to work on this thing today and let’s go out and do it,’” Quinn said. “I give him a lot of credit that he came through and was ready to go.”
  Of the 13 freshmen joining UF’s 
defense, Jon Halapio said Fowler has been the most impressive. 
  “The one standout [is] Dante 
Fowler,” said Halapio, who has known Fowler since the freshman was in eighth grade. “He was deter-mined to play this year. He’s having a great camp.”
  Quinn said he was impressed 
by Fowler’s power and lower-body strength. Halapio was wowed by Fowler’s play on the practice ﬁ  eld. 
  “Honestly , I didn’t think he was 
going to perform how he’s perform-
ing now,” Halapio said. “It’s really 
good to see that he’s been working hard, even in the summer.”
  Jacobs Improving: After struggling 
with his conditioning upon arriving at Florida in the spring, Damien Ja-cobs looks like a new man, accord-ing to Quinn. 
  Not only has Jacobs brought his 
weight down to 284 pounds, but 
he’s added quickness and pass-rush 
ability at defensive tackle. 
  “His conditioning level is a lot bet-
ter than when he ﬁ  rst got here, and 
I think his pass rush has improved,” Quinn said. “He’s lighter. When he ﬁ  rst came in, he was heavier and his conditioning wasn’t as good.”
  Jacobs was signed out of East 
Mississippi Community College 
in the spring by a Gators team des-
perate to improve its pass rush and depth on the interior line. 
  After a slow start, Jacobs appears 
to be emerging as an option.   “You can see his quickness really 
come out,” Quinn said. “I think he adds another inside rusher for us, so that’s a role that I’m anxious to see him develop through the course of 
the ﬁ  rst couple of games.”
  Omar Hunter has marveled at 
Jacobs’ power. 
  “He’s got that old-man strength,” 
Hunter said. “Not like the weight 
room, but the old-man strength. It’s weird, very weird. You might could bench more than him, but on the football ﬁ  eld he’s just strong. It’s 
crazy strength.”

on  Saturday at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. 
 Fowler getting rave reviews in practice
  The Florida offensive linemen trust each other.
  They like playing alongside one another, and they 
are close friends who like hanging out together.
  But that doesn’t mean they will play well together.
  Prior to last season, the offensive line spoke glowingly of 
the unity and cohesiveness that had developed throughout fall practice. 
  “We’re with each other 24/7, talking to each other 24/7,” 
junior Kyle Koehne said last fall of himself and roommates and fellow interior linemen Jonotthan Harrison and Jon Hala-pio. “We’ve got some good chemistry between the three of us.”
  “The chemistry is a lot better,” Halapio added at the time. 
“We communicate a lot better on the ﬁ  eld, so it’s good that we’re good friends off the ﬁ  eld.”
  But the chemistry did not translate to the ﬁ  eld as the line 
ﬁ  nished in the bottom half of the Southeastern Conference in sacks allowed in conference play. The group also struggled to both run and pass block throughout the season, and the team was ranked eighth in both rushing and passing offense in SEC games.
  In the absence of departed running backs Jeff Demps and 
Chris Rainey, both of whom could use their speed to get to the edge, the Gators will need an improved of-
fensive front that can create holes for 
current starting running back Mike Gillislee, who is more of a north-south runner.
  Regardless of whether the line can 
actually accomplish that, the linemen and coaches are saying all the right 
things again.
  “We have a lot of, I guess, a lot of games where we actu-
ally have to work with each other, and we are tightly bond-ed,” Harrison said. “We were working on our O-line unity 
throughout the whole summer.”
  “I think just having a year under our belt, especially play-
ing together, going through the struggles last year, just pull-
ing in together and just being closer with these guys, and deﬁ  -
nitely just playing with each other for a year, you just build 
that trust factor,” Halapio said.
  We have no reason to believe them.   Fans and media will have seen the unit, which is full of 
once highly touted recruits who underperformed last season, 
take the ﬁ  eld only once before the season opener: in Satur-
day’s open practice that included few contact drills. 
  First-year offensive coordinator Brent Pease installed a 
new offense in the offseason that required the line to learn 
fresh blocking schemes. 
And while it might be hard to quantify the effect an offen-
sive line coach has on his unit, the fact that they have had to 
make the transition from Frank Verducci to Tim Davis is yet UF offensive line

more blocking JURNY DUTY

ACL, leading Quinn to be confident that last year’s starter at Buck linebacker will be back at some point this season. 
“I’m really proud of the way he’s approached 
this,” Quinn said. “The guy has been very aggres-sive and diligent and on it, so I am expecting to have him back at some point.”
Although Quinn limited Dominique Easley’s 
workload in fall camp to ease him back into game 
action after an ACL tear,  the defensive tackle ap-
pears to be ready to play a full game. 
“He looks good and ready to rock,” Quinn said. 
“I’m pretty pleased with where he’s at, and his con-ditioning level is good, and his strength is good.”

Quinn expects Powell to play in 2012another adjustment the lineman 
have had to work through.
Taking into account the offen-
sive line’s 2011 campaign, which is probably the best way to evalu-ate it given the lack of live action open to the media, expecting sig-
nificant improvement from the 
unit as a whole is impossible.
A reason for optimism would 
be that the line consists of almost the same group of players from last year, minus Dan Wenger and David Young, but continuity does not necessarily lead to productiv-
ity.
“They’re with each other 
so much in individual period 
through practice.” Pease said. “I mean they have 35-40 minutes 
where they’re all together.”
The rest of the offense just 
needs to hope that their time 
spent together produces more 
than good memories.

Although she has moved from forward to defender, Taylor Travis still has 
opportunities to push forward and initiate the Gators offense.
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Writer
 
Taylor Travis spent her first two seasons at 
Florida trying to find a way to score.
Now, in her junior year, her job is to stop oth-
er teams from doing so.
Before the women’s soccer team kicked off its 
season, Travis made the switch from forward to 
defender.
As a forward, Travis was named the 2010 
Southeastern Conference Freshman of the Year 
and was chosen as a member of the All-SEC Sec-
ond Team.
She started 17 matches, scored three goals 
and led the SEC with seven assists in conference play. Travis accrued 17 points overall in 2010.
However, in 2011, Travis had her minutes cut 
in half, and she only started four games. Her as-sist total fell from 11 to two.
With a crowded group of forwards includ-
ing redshirt senior McKenzie Barney, 2011 All-
American Erika Tymrak, Canada U-20 team 
member Adriana Leon and Florida’s only goal-scorer this season, freshman Claire Falknor, Tra-
vis made the move to the backfield.
Travis said she was ready to play as a back 
because she had prepared before the Gators’ sea-
son began.
“I played outside back a little in club and a 
little for the Region team,” Travis said. “I played 
that position before. It was a little easier transi-
tion than most people expected it to be.”
Travis started the season opener against Mi-
ami as an outside back and logged 62 minutes, more than she had in any game during the 2011 season. Against the Hurricanes, Travis pushed for -
ward on the outside when the Gators held pos-session.
“We get forward so much, it’s almost like be-
ing an outside midfielder,” she said.
As an outside back, Travis can use the pass-
ing skills she demonstrated during her produc-tive freshman season to set up scoring opportu-nities for midfielders and forwards.
However, with defenders playing forward 
on offense, the defense is more vulnerable if the Gators turn the ball over.
“A lot of us get caught going forward, and 
we’re not always going to keep the ball every time we go forward,” Travis said. 
Travis will likely see playing time when the 
Gators travel to Chapel Hill, N.C.,  this weekend to play No. 14 North Carolina and No. 2 Duke. Travis is from Raleigh, only about 30 miles from Chapel Hill.
“That’s my hometown … I’ve got a lot of 
friends and family coming out,” Travis said. “It’ll be nice to have a little Gator section.”
When Travis’ friends and family arrive at the 
field, they may not be used to where she’s posi-tioned, but Travis doesn’t mind.
“I can still be creative and go forward at the 
same time, and I’m also able to defend,” she said. “I love defending, and I love 1 v. 1’s, so it’s kind of the best of both worlds.”Travis switching from crowded offense to defense for Gators

little easier transition than most people

This offseason has been a time of 
major change for coach Mary Wise.
Over the last eight months, Wise 
has seen a completely different team 
walk through the doors, altered 
UF’s playing scheme for the first 
time in four years and toyed with the NCAA’s new substitution rules.
Wise pushed the restart button 
over the summer and began from ground zero because of the changes the Gators face, saying it was fair to call this her hardest adjustment pe-riod in recent years. After falling to Illinois in the 
Elite Eight to end the 2011 season, Florida lost five players to gradua-tion, including two All-Americans. Wise picked up six true freshmen and Taylor Brauneis, a junior trans-
fer setter, to help fill the void left by 
Kelly Murphy and Kristy Jaeckel. 
“You get new players, and with 
the freshmen, in terms of teaching them the system and all, that took some time,” Wise said. 
“That was a big thing, with just 
how many new faces we have,” Brauneis said. “And I think [Wise] 
adjusted very well. I feel like she 
put a lot of faith in us. And I think we played really well as a team and I think we really just have to push 
ourselves to be the 
best we can every day in practice, in games and every-
thing.”
Brauneis, who 
spent her first 
two years at Lou-isville, was one of the major influ-
ences in the change from a 6-2 sys-tem to a 5-1. Rather than have two setters on the court at the same time, 
Brauneis will carry all of the setting 
responsibilities. “It’s going to take a while to gel 
and mesh and really get a feel for each other,” senior Tangerine Wiggs said. “But we’re doing a great job at practice. I think we’ll do fine run-ning a 5-1.”
Although the transition will be 
seamless for Brauneis, who has played in a 5-1 offense virtually all her life, the new rotation has made 
Wise’s workload a little heavier.
“We look at it as, ‘It’s a process,’ 
and that the players embrace the 
fact that we’re just trying to get bet-ter,” Wise said. “All we’re trying to do is figure how to score points and win.”Florida’s coach of 21 years is 
looking forward to the new 15 sub-stitution limit that the NCAA put in place this season. The expansion from 12 to 15 substitutions will al-low the Gators to interchange more fresh legs into critical games.
“She’s excited about [the chang-
es],” senior Betsy Smith said. “It’s a lot of new things but it is, at the end 
of the day , still the game she loves 
and the game she knows so well. She just knows how to inspire us and just really go out there and com-pete. That’s her big thing: compet-ing. And she does a great job lead-ing us.”

� UF FACES UNC TONIGHT AT 7 IN 
CHAPEL HILL.

An unranked Miami team outpaced then-
No. 21 Florida last Friday, but coach Becky 
Burleigh doesn’t believe UF’s season-opening 4-1 loss was the result of a lack of effort.
She’s already pegged two areas in which 
the Gators (0-1) need to improve: communica-tion and organization. 
“It’s hard to convert when your team is not 
organized,” Burleigh said. “Some of that has to go to the coaching staff and some of that has to go to the players’ abilities to make changes during a game. We have to be able to adjust on the fly when things don’t go exactly as we planned.”
In preparation for a grueling stretch against 
No. 14 North Carolina (0-1) tonight at 7 and No. 2 Duke (2-0) on Sunday at the Carolina Nike Classic in Chapel Hill, N.C., Burleigh emphasized chemistry and trusting UF’s sys-tem of play to her team throughout the week. 
“Both of the practices this week, it’s been 
concentrating on set pieces and staying with your man and bodying up and all the little things,” senior midfielder Holly King said. 
“As a team, we’ve definitely gotten better. We 
just learned from it.”
The Gators’ lack of defensive coherence on 
set pieces sparked the Hurricanes. Confusion from sophomore goalkeeper Taylor Burke and the back line during corner kicks led to Miami headers in the 12th and 32nd minutes.
A miscommunication on a clearance at-
tempt resulted in UM’s second goal, a 3-yard tap in by Kate Howarth in the 17th minute.
Florida also had trouble communicating 
offensively , tallying only one shot on goal in 
the first half as it fell into a 3-0 hole. 
“We have to stay pa-
tient. For us, our offense stems from our defense,” 
King said. “If we go hard at everything and our offense is helping us as a team, that’s just how it’s going to start our attack.”
The Gators are looking to get back on track 
against the short-handed Tar Heels, who have 
starting forwards Kealia Ohai and Crystal Dunn competing for the U.S. national team at 
the FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup. UNC fell to Portland in a 1-0 upset last Friday.
“[UNC is] pretty high octane,” Burleigh 
said. “They’re going to go 100 miles an hour, and we’re going to have to deal with that pres-sure.”
Injury Report: According to Burleigh, junior 
outside back Maggie Rodgers will sit out this 
weekend as she continues to nurse an ankle in-jury. Last season, Rodgers started in 16 match-es and logged 1,554 minutes, eighth most on the team. 
Burleigh also said Tuesday that sopho-
more midfielder Annie Speese, who sprained her right ankle last Friday night in a collision, 
would see the field tonight.

 When the Gators open their sea-
son against Florida International to-
night at 7:30 p.m. in the O’Connell Center, they’ll have the opportunity to do something they haven’t done 
since 2007 — run a 5-1 offense.
  “It’s something the fans will be 
excited about because it’s some-
thing we haven’t run here at Florida in a long time,” junior Chloe Mann said. “They’ll get to see the setter be really offensive, which I know is re-ally exciting.” 
  Florida has had much success 
with its new offense in the past. 
Last time it ran a 5-1 was with three-
time All-American Angie McGinn-is, who led the team to a 29-3 record and a Southeastern Conference title 
with 1,485 assists in 2007.
  However, after running a 6-2 of-
fense for the last four years, there is 
going to be a lot of change for the outside hitters and the libero, ac-cording to senior Tangerine Wiggs. 
  “Taylor (Unroe), or whoever 
plays libero, has to work on de-fending a 5-1 behind the setter,” Wiggs said. “It’s a little different than defending behind a right side in the middle because we run a dif-
ferent defense behind a setter in the 
middle. It’s going to be harder for 
Taylor, but she’s a great passer, and 
I have no doubt that she’ll do just 
ﬁ  ne.”  
  Although Wiggs said they 
haven’t run a 6-2 at practice yet, she 
said there is a possibility the Gators will use that style of offense.
  “Expect anything from us,” 
Wiggs said. “During preseason, I 
have no doubt that the coaches will 
try different lineups to make sure 
everyone gets playing time. Any-thing’s possible at this point, but we have been practicing a 5-1.”
  Given the changes the Gators  
face, their main concern for this weekend’s Campus USA Credit Union Invite isn’t the competition, 
but working on their own prob-
lems. 
  “We’re a lot more focused on 
ourselves and making sure we’re 
doing all the things on our side of 
the net to execute and score points,” Wiggs said. “We’re less concerned about opponents. It’s more when we get into the SEC that we get really concerned about our oppo-
nents.”
  Another change for the Gators 
will be the absence of sophomore 
Noami Santos-Lamb. The outside hitter, who was responsible for 14.5 points in 20 sets last year, tore her ACL during the Fan Day scrim-mage on Saturday. 
  “I felt that we really lost a week 
and a half because we had to start 
over (from) square one when Noa-
mi got injured,” coach Mary Wise 
said. “Right now we’re just trying 
to ﬁ  gure it out.”
  Even though the Gators have 
ﬁ  ve other outside hitters to choose 
from, all of them are freshmen, and 
Wise only had six days to make a 
decision. 
  “When the lights come on and 
the ﬁ  rst whistle blows, I know we’ll 
compete,” Wise said. “Will we be as organized and 
seamless as I would have liked us to have been? No, but everything changed on Saturday.”
