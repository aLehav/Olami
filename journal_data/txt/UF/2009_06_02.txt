Six University police cars sat outside Mar-
ston Science Library and at least six officers 
searched the area for a suspected criminal 
Monday afternoon.
The crime: book theft.
Maria Hicks, a food and resource econom-
ics undergraduate, left her table on the fourth floor to answer her cell phone. 
When she returned, a man at her table was 
zipping his backpack up, but she thought noth-ing of it, she said.
Then she noticed her $200 “Data Analysis” 
book was missing.
She searched for the man with the back-
pack, who she described as wearing an orange UF Gators shirt.
“I tried to chase him,” she said. “He disap-
peared so fast.”
UPD responded by searching the area for 
people matching the thief’s description. Of-
ficers searched the bags of several people and 
questioned them  about the crime.
Hicks had borrowed the textbook from a 
friend and will have to pay her back, she said.
Pam Bonner, a UPD spokeswoman, offered 
a moral to the story.
“Don’t leave your stuff; take it with you if 
you go somewhere,” she said.ON CAMPUSCops mob

UF’s new $17 million parking 
complex will open its gates Aug. 24 
to UF students, faculty and staff.
While the 950-space garage will be available to all commuting Gators, 
it should mostly relieve parking for 
those who use the Health Science Center, the College of Veterinary Medicine and the Office of Infor-mation Technology, which are all nearby.“I’m not sure if the parking prob-
lem will ever be relieved,” said Scott 
Fox, director of Trans-portation and Parking Services. “But with the opening of the new ga-
rage, a lot of spaces will be added.”The Southwest Parking Garage 
Complex will have six stories and will contain the widest parking spots on campus. Its construction is intended to bring the number of de-cals issued closer to the number of spaces available.Because there are only 24,000 
spaces, only about two-thirds of the 36,000 drivers who are issued decals can park on campus at any given time.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida’s 
state universities will be able to increase 
tuition rates up to 15 percent annually until they reach the national average under a new law Gov. Charlie Crist signed Monday.
Crist, university officials and the Florida 
Student Association supported the tuition bill, saying rates that now are among the na-tion’s lowest must go up to improve quality, help pay for need-based scholarships and stop a brain drain of faculty to other states that pay better. The 15 percent maximum in-cludes across-the-board tuition increases or-dered by the Legislature. This year, lawmak-ers have approved an 8 percent statewide increase. Each of the 11 public universities now can add a differential of 7 percent.
The 8 percent increase will boost tuition 
for a student taking the average 30 credit hours in a year by $197 for a total of $2,658. At 15 percent, the increase would be $369 for a $2,830 total.

into bankruptcy on Monday and 
said the federal government will act as “reluctant shareholder” when it assumes a 60 percent

A sweaty crowd of about 35 people 
linked arms, grabbed one another’s butts 
and sang “Somewhere Over the Rainbow” in the Civic Media Center on Sunday night as part of a traveling “gay vaudeville” 
group’s performance.
The CMC hosted FINGERS Queer Caba-
ret, which includes skits performed by a 
group of five people, including Edie Fake, Dewayne Slightweight, Silky Shoemaker, 
Owen Brightman and Scott Tankersley.
“The idea of fingers is a separate entity,” 
Shoemaker said, “but the thing with fingers 
is that they have to come together and work together to form a hand.”
Shoemaker added that the group’s ap-
pearance in Gainesville marked their ninth performance.
“We are ending our tour at a queer mu-
sical festival in about two weeks,” Shoe-maker said.
FINGERS preformed four skits over two 
hours, each written and performed by a single member, Shoemaker said.
Performances included props such as a 
giant fabric sphincter that an actor interact-ed with to demonstrate ideas of equality.
“The shit ain’t gonna stop,” the actor 
said.
An electric guitarist sang a 45-minute 
song on the same issue, and the following acts incorporated a stilt walker, tap danc-ing and onion chopping punctuated by a speech on philosophy.
The CMC requested a $5 donation from 
attendees at the door.
All donations went to FINGERS to help 
pay for miscellaneous things such as food and mechanical problems that may arise with their vegetable-oil-fueled 1974 bus, 
Shoemaker said.
Taylor and Lee Savage, who have lived 
in Gainesville for 24 years, put all of the 
cash they had with them into the donation 
box, they said.
The Savages were unable to recall how 
much the donation was, but said they were 
searching for the box to put in an additional $20 that they realized they had.
Gainesville community’s non-judgmen-
tal views are to credit for performances like this being held in the city, they said.
“A lot of people here support gay, les-
bian, transgender causes,” Lee Savage said. “We try to be part of it and support every-one who does it.”LCOALTraveling queers perform skits, demonstrate unity 
� ONE TO THREE STORMS 
ARE FORECASTED TO BE MAJOR HURRICANES.

Meteorologists will keep an 
eye out for  Ana, Bill, Claudette, 
Danny and Erika this year.
The National Oceanic and At-
mospheric Administration pre-
dicted that this year’s hurricane season will bring four to seven 
hurricanes and nine to 14 tropical 
storms in 2009. Hurricane season began Monday.
One to three storms are pre-
dicted to reach category 3 or higher. Category 3 winds range from 111 to 113 mph.
Residents of Florida and other 
hurricane-prone areas are urged 
to be prepared for the season, 
said Kenneth Allen, emergency management coordinator in the Environmental Health and Safety department. 
“NOAA’s predictions are on 
a macro level,” Allen said, “so no matter what the forecasts are, there’s no way to predict whether 
our area is going to impacted or not. So we have to prepare every year as if we 
are going to be impacted.”
Allen recommends that resi-
dents create an evacuation plan and keep three days worth of food and water.                                   On-campus residents should 
follow the advice of the housing staff, and off-campus residents should follow advice from local officials, Allen said.
Instructions may include a 
boil-water advisory or a curfew. 
In the event of a hurricane, the 
city’s fire departments, police, work crews and administrators 
will be placed on standby as part 
of the city’s Emergency Opera-tion Plan, said Bob Woods, City of Gainesville spokesman.                                                                        Woods recommends keeping 
a shortwave radio and batter-ies, prescription medication, a first aid kit and important docu-ments.
To help residents prepare, 
the city also created a Web site, which can be found at the city of Gainesville home page. Links on the Web site direct users to emer-
gency contact information for 
people with children and pets. 
“The time to prepare is now,” 
Woods said.

The City of Gainesville opened 
the floor for citizens to voice their 
concerns and criticism Monday night at the Doyle Connor Build-ing, 1911 SW 34th St.
About 24 Gainesville residents 
made their voices heard during the two-hour meeting. Citizens discussed a wide range of issues, including land use, transporta-
tion, community and quality of 
life.
The town hall meeting was the 
third in a series of four.
Gabriel Hillel, 74, and Victor 
Vega, 15, were residents among the two dozen who spoke about these issues. 
Vega said UF students are tak-
ing many of the jobs that would otherwise be available for young-er or older residents.
“I respect UF students,” Vega 
said. “They run things, but in a way that kind of blows away the other population.” 
Vega said that local residents 
have “every right to this place as 
everyone else does.”
Some of his improvements for 
the city included more events and 
activities for 14- to 17-year-olds, 
fewer trees, slightly bigger hous-
es, wider sidewalks, more public parking and more employment for middle-aged people.Vega discussed the lack of 
parking for residents not affiliat-ed with the university living near 
campus.
“One time my mom had to 
park two miles away to find pub-
lic parking around UF,” Vega 
said. 
Hillel, a former civil rights 
journalist, focused more on the racial boundaries still present in 
Gainesville.
“There’s a lack of communica-
tion throughout the city,” Hillel said, “and it gets exacerbated be-tween the races, so no one cares what is happening on the other 
side of town.” 
“And when police officers 
throw eggs in Porters Neigh-borhood, there’s a problem,” 
Hillel said,  referencing an inci-dent last November where three 
Gainesville Police Department of-
ficers rode through the neighbor-hood with the intent of harassing prostitutes and drug dealers.
Hillel told the mayor and com-
missioners that the new GPD po-lice chief should be black and that the new Office of Equal Opportu-
nity director should not be black, 
to encourage diversity. 
The Gainesville community 
needs to talk about race, among 
other things, he said
“(The city is) trying to avoid 
hard problems,” he said. “And 
I’m not talking about potholes.”
Hillel, a resident of Gainesville 
for 17 years, also said the city is too decentralized and too spread out, and because of this, no one knows what activities are going 
on.
He believes the city should cre-
ate a phone number people can 
call to find out what is going on in the city that day. 
“If I like to ride bikes then I 
would press 7 to hear about plac-es to ride a bike,” he said as an example. 
He said that many people do 
not know that the Hippodrome State Theatre shows movies, or that Gainesville is the first “fly city,” refering to the butterfly gar-
den on campus.
Overall, Hillel said he believes 
awareness and communication is 
key.
“There should be a resident 
tour bus to take them around town, so they can see where they 
live.” 
The next town hall meeting will 
be June 15 at the United Church of

John Leibach plays a solo during the Gainesville Community Jazz Band’s 
performance at the “Free Fridays” concert series on Friday.
� THE GAINESVILLE        
COMMUNITY JAZZ BAND PERFORMED FRIDAY.
By STEVE JOHNSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
It had been 20 years since John 
Leibach had  picked up his tenor 
saxophone. 
Leibach, a gastroenterologist 
with the Digestive Disease Asso-ciation, didn’t know if he would  
ever play again after his communi-
ty jazz band broke up in the 1980s.
In the fall of 2008, one of Leibach’s 
patients , a fellow musician named 
Frank Young, called him about an opening in the Gainesville Com-munity Jazz Band. 
What seemed like an endless 
silence for Leibach’s tenor saxo-
phone quickly turned into a scram-
ble to relearn the instrument he had played since he was in sixth grade.
“Can we practice once?” 
Leibach said to Young. “I don’t re-member having to struggle to see the music.”
Two days later, Leibach and the 
Gainesville Community Jazz Band 
performed at The Village, a retire-
ment community in northwest Gainesville.
The story of John Leibach and 
Frank Young is one of many that can be learned from the short his-tory of the Gainesville Commu-nity Jazz Band, which began in the summer of 2007. 
More than 20 years had passed 
since Gainesville had a community jazz band until Marco Thomas, a 
music teacher at Joseph Williams 
Elementary School, gathered a few 
band directors from local schools 
to play.
“I really wanted to play jazz,” 
Thomas said. “So we just kind of 
started building it.”
Beginning with a handful of 
musicians and fliers posted in local 
music stores, Thomas’ jazz band grew to 17 members with widely 
different backgrounds and profes-
sions.
Friday night, the band per-
formed for the “Free Fridays” concert series at the Bo Diddley Community Plaza in downtown Gainesville.
As the sun set, and the band 
began playing, people spread blan-
kets and unpacked folding chairs. 
During the performance, children of all ages danced to the sounds of Count Basie and Glenn Miller. 
“It’s been a lot of fun,” said Da-
vid Ballard, director of events for the Division for Cultural Affairs. “People are dancing and having a 
wonderful time together.”
The sounds of downtown 
Gainesville occasionally made 
their way into the score. Ambu-lance sirens, or solos, as Thomas 
called them, crescendoed and de-
crescendoed during the band’s 
performance of hits from the 1930s 
and the 1940s.
Leibach and Young both played 
in the original community jazz band in 1972 and have remained friends.
“There was always an under-
standing that if anything came along, to let him know because he loves to play,” Young said of Leibach. “And by golly, he came out and did it.”
Leibach, lead tenor saxophone, 
tapped his left foot and counted silently to himself between musi-
cal phrases as Young swayed from 
side to side with the rest of the 
trumpet line. 
Both musicians said they will 
continue to play with the commu-nity jazz band and have no plans of 
stopping anytime soon.
“We’re playing for the love of 
playing,” Young said. “If we get paid, OK. If we don’t, it doesn’t 
bother me.”Doctor rekindles his love for 
performance through jazz band
“It’s been a lot of fun. 
People are dancing and 
having a wonderful time 
together.”

OPINIONS EDITORChalk it up to jealousy 
or downright lunacy, but much fuss has been 
made over President Barack Obama’s weekend jaunt to 
the Big Apple with his wife.
And what exactly did they 
do, you ask? 
Rub elbows with Jay-Z 
and Derek Jeter at the 40/40 
Club? Dine like royalty on champagne and caviar at the Russian Tea Room? Maybe satiate a craving for beef with 
steaks as big as your face at 
Peter Luger’s in Brooklyn? Hardly.
The First Couple feasted 
on locally grown cuisine at Blue Hill — a pricey but hard-ly jaw-dropping restaurant located in the West Village. Hell, Michelle even decided 
to order not one, but two mar-
tinis. After dinner, Barack and Michelle headed uptown to catch the play “Joe Turner’s Come and Gone,” which looks at black America in the early 1900s. 
Let’s put aside the reces-
sion or the fact that General Motors just filed for bank-ruptcy for a moment and real-
ize Obama wasn’t trying to do 
anything more than be a good husband.
Yes Hillary, they do exist.With the campaign a dis-
tant memory and the transi-tion to the not-always-so-friendly-confines of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. complete, 
Obama utilized an event-free 
weekend to take Michelle on a much overdue date. Simply put, a fancy but not over-the-top dinner and evening at the theater won’t exactly make or break America’s current fi-nancial situation. Americans shouldn’t concern themselves 
over who footed the bill for 
the Obamas’ date but rather celebrate a president who places a premium on keeping the spark in his marriage alive and well.Eco-awareness hitting the mainstream Not the Answer
Controversial abortion 
doctor killed by radical
100 TOTAL VOTES57% YES
43% NOToday’s question: Do you think the First Couple’s date was too extravagant?Thursday’s question: Are you a fan of “game night”?ColumnFor Dr. George Tiller, even the sanctity of his house of 
worship could not protect him from those who vehe-mently opposed his life’s work.
The abortion doctor met his untimely death on Sunday 
at the hands of Scott Roeder — who fired a single bullet from his handgun at Tiller while the doctor stood in the foyer of his church. Known as one of three physicians in 
the country who performed late-term abortions, Tiller 
sparked a string of violence from radicals hell-bent on closing down his Wichita clinic. From the 1986 bombing of his practice to being shot in each of his arms in 1993, Tiller refused to let such deterrents impede his ability to 
provide medical care to pregnant women and teens from 
across the country.
Simply put, Tiller’s dedication to his work trumped any 
lingering fears for his own safety.
Call Tiller a ruthless killer or a medical wunderkind, his 
murder represents nothing more than a logically flawed statement on the part of a community that champions life. As eloquently stated by President Barack Obama, “How-ever profound our differences as Americans over difficult 
issues such as abortion, they cannot be resolved by hei-
nous acts of violence.” 
While the legality of Tiller’s medical practices have 
been called into question, the act of taking the man’s life 
surely was not the answer.
Just beyond the issue of America’s flailing economy lies 
the legality of abortion — already the next hot political 
topic and destined to be further fueled by Tiller’s death.
In these heady times of global awareness and eco-knowledge, it seems the bad eco-news comes at you from every angle. Nobody is safe from the onslaught 
of negative press if even Google is under eco-scrutiny. A researcher this year claimed that a single Google search is worse for the environment than driving a car, mostly because of the way Google’s “cloud computing” uses clus-
ters of servers together at once to achieve superfast results 
for every single search.
Just think of all the extra angst this revelation brought 
to the skinny-jeans, hipster, vegan crowd. Just when they thought those years of riding tiny bikes and eating Tofur-
key shrank their carbon footprint, all those Google search-
es for crappy bands and gluten-free recipes exploded their houses of smug.
However, the news isn’t all bad on the environmental 
front. Car companies are scrambling to actually use the green technology they have been ignoring and burying for the last three decades. The most exciting eco-technology, though, is still in the developmental phase.
A car company in China is reportedly working on 
groundbreaking neurotechnology that can tap into potent human emotions to power an automobile. Using a special-ly-made steering wheel and sensors placed on the tempo-ral lobes, Mirage Motors is taking the lead in a carbon-free 
driving experience.
Engineers for Mirage, working closely with the Chi-
nese government, tailored a car for suburban American 
markets that runs entirely on white guilt. This car, already in postproduction, can reach speeds of 75 miles per hour 
solely by tapping into the deep reservoir of guilt white 
Americans feel for the way slavery and discrimination have shaped our country.Since the election of President Ba-
rack Obama and the recent selection of a Latina to the Supreme Court, 
Mirage has decided that plans to 
roll the car out in America will be delayed until 2011 at the earliest. A smaller Mirage Chimera coupe run-
ning on colonial guilt will hit major 
European markets in the fall.
Mirage Motors, in the Maxx Hy-
perbole series, also developed a line of SUVs and heavy-duty work trucks powered by righteous anger. These ve-
hicles, specially designed to only play talk radio at a high 
volume with no option to turn it off or lower the volume, have reached speeds of 95 miles per hour (on a closed track, with Hannitized drivers). GM, the newest toy of the 
American taxpayer, is understandably excited about this 
new technology.
Many environmentalists complain about ethanol, our 
heavily-subsidized and homegrown biofuel that gets no respect outside the American heartland. I bet you kooky 
environmentalists hate on high fructose corn syrup, too. 
Listen — it’s made from corn. Scoreboard.
Ostensibly, a large majority of these celebrated eco-

Letter to the Editor
Guest columnist exhibits clear lack of maturity 
In Thursday’s guest column, Matthew Meltzer’s use 
of trite warnings and sweeping generalizations served to 
demonstrate his estimation that if he is not ready for mar-riage in his 20s, no one else can be.
Not married himself and relying on the dependable 
source of “or so I am told,” Meltzer gave his argument lit-tle credence. His glamorization of drunken escapades as the superior alternative to marriage reveals more about Meltzer’s own maturity (or lack thereof) and values than that of most 20-somethings. The institution of marriage is certainly worthy of examination and critique. 
Yet Meltzer merely resorts to a repetition of unorigi-
nal exaggerations, undermining what could have been a thoughtful analysis of an establishment rife with both tradition and controversy. 
As with most things in life, all relationships are in-
dividual and cannot be categorized with such blanket statements. Signing a marriage certificate in one’s 20s does not guarantee a happily ever-after, nor does it “only lead to bad things” as Meltzer puts it. 
Sadly, Meltzer simply propagated cliched gender 
stereotypes with his tales of wives who are “ALWAYS THERE.” 
As Meltzer seems to be under the unfortunate as-
sumption that women want to trap men into a marriage in order to secure a partner for viewing “Grey’s Anato-my” and dominating in Pictionary, I suggest he take his own advice and do some thorough self-examination be-fore ever considering marriage, even past his 20s.

4LSLately, and between reading 
entries on the Rotten Library, I have turned my attention to the 
criminal justice system. 
I am certainly no criminologist; re-
grettably I haven’t had the time to get a degree from the University of Phoe-nix, but in my amateur opinion, this system requires a significant over-haul. Its standards are far too draco-nian, where it does not serve the pub-lic interest, and far too lenient, where harshness should be warranted. 
First a disclaimer of sorts: this dis-
cussion is meant to be suggestive and not exhaustive. If it inspires some-one to consider writing a more fully formed argument in favor of any of the tenets I put forth here, then I will consider my job done. Further, the harsher measures I suggest are meant only for a context where one can trust the legal system implicitly and, as Sa-
mantha Black Crow told us, “no one 
but a moron would ever trust the le-gal system.”
The first of the two variations of 
failure in our current system of en-forced morality is the brutality with which it disposes of what amount, ultimately, to petty crimes. Vari-ous “three-strikes laws” illustrate 
the problems herein and give rise to 
some rather absurd examples. 
In California, there are mandatory 
sentences if convicted of an offense three times. Shoplifting falls under this category, and there is at least one instance there where, as a 
result, some-
one who shop-lifted a set of golf clubs was handed 25 years. Ad-
ditionally, under the three-strikes systems, numerous strikes can be awarded for the same incidence of 
deviation, resulting in one crime that 
would ordinarily be handled reason-ably, instead resulting in concurrent sentences that can total 50 years or more. 
This leads to an overcrowded pris-
on system that loses whatever hope it once had of being rehabilitative. Before I am accused of weeping for 
the damned, however, let me take a 
more pragmatic approach. Though I am unsure of the exact figure, the an-nual cost of sustaining an inmate in Florida must run the taxpayers some-where in the area of tens of thousands of dollars. 
In Virginia, the cost per prisoner 
was a startling $24,332 for 2008. At 
prices like this, can we afford draco-
nian standards?
Then again, we come to the other 
horn of the dilemma. Many times, the legal system deals far too leniently with crimes that deserve something more serious. An example would be child molestation, where sentences as light as five years are not completely unheard of.
My suggestion here is a bit harsh-
er. In an ideal society, wherein lighter crimes go lightly punished, I would suggest a penalty of execution for first-degree (that is, premeditated) murderers, rapists and child molest-ers, assuming their guilt could be positively established and there were no mitigating mental circumstances, 
to borrow from the language of lega-
lese. These crimes are certainly unfor-givable and also have high recidivism rates. 
Think of it not as revenge, but 
rather as a step to protect society. The death penalty was ruled out 5-4 by the Supreme Court in cases of child mo-lestation as recently as 2008, though, 
so my ideal society will have to wait 
until the court reconsiders.
The flaws in our American justice 
system are plenty, and I have here given only a sampling. 
The ill-using of those convicted 
of relatively minor offenses, and the charity shown to those with a predi-lection for the worst types of offenses 
are indicative of a backward national 
psyche. A determined reappraisal is warranted.

the remainder is reserved for visitor, de-livery, service and emergency vehicles.
“We will always have a supply and 
demand challenge,” Fox said. “But the 
garage will certainly help.”
The Southwest Parking Garage Com-
plex will include green, orange, blue, car-
pool and gated zones. It is not yet deter-mined how many spaces will be reserved for each, and parking will not be available to students who live on campus.
The complex will also serve as the new 
home of UF’s Transportation and Parking 
Services, with 9,000 square feet of office space. 
Along with the increase in parking 
spaces, there will be a 10 percent hike in 
decal costs. 
According to UF’s Transportation and 
Parking Services Web site, a semester stu-
dent commuter decal currently costs $72. 
An annual decal is $134.
UF Transportation and 
Parking Services does not 
receive funding from the 
university or state and relies solely on de-cal sales.
Because the university does not restrict 
the number of decals sold, fall sales’ profit 
will likely cover the $20.7 million total 
price tag of the project.
“We are not in the business of turning a profit,” Fox said. “We are in the business of breaking even.”
The proximity of the garage to Ben Hill 
Griffin Stadium rouses another demand problem. 
Although students and employees 
can gain weekday access to the garage, the transportation office has yet to decide whether the access will include the week-ends during football season or be restrict-ed to season ticketholders, Fox said.
The parking complex called for a 
12-month construction phase, including six months in design, and is set to be com-pleted on schedule.
“The project has been nothing but suc-
cessful,” he said. “It is a true win-win situ-ation, especially for students.”Fall decal sales will help pay for $20.7M garage

The city is offering a little practice on the 
house to Gainesville’s experienced golfers.
Ironwood Golf Course is giving away a 
free pail of golf balls to people who partici-
pate in a new online survey, according to a release.
Amid controversy and disagreement 
between city commissioners, the city of Gainesville recently committed at least $1 million to improving the course.
The survey requires knowledge of the 
course and asks questions about how often participants golf, quality of the course and includes open-ended questions inviting criticism.
“This survey has been designed by the 
National Golf Foundation to help us iden-tify areas that could use improvement,” said Bob Woods, a Gainesville city spokes-man.
Once the survey is completed, participants 
will receive a coupon redeemable through Dec. 31 at Ironwood Golf Course located at  
2100 NE 39th Ave.
Golfers are encouraged to bring their 
own clubs, but the course can provide driv-ers, according to Steve Phillips, director of Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs.

According to the report, after he was Tasered, Jenkins 
got up and ran away despite commands from Martin to 
stop.
Jenkins was caught and arrested about one and a half 
blocks away, the report stated.
Jenkins told police that he was fighting because he 
thought members of the group were trying to steal his 
chain.  
UF team spokesman Steve McClain said the coaching 
staff is aware of the incident and is await-
ing the results of the investigation.  
Jenkins was released from jail on $2,000 
bond Sunday.
As a freshman, Jenkins started 12 games 
during the 2008 football season.
Previous to Jenkins’ arrest, two UF 
football players have been arrested in the 2009 off-season.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NEW YORK (AP) — Long be-
fore President Barack Obama point-
ed out Sonia Sotomayor’s mother to 
the world, the small, white-haired 
woman whose daughter is the pres-ident’s pick for the Supreme Court was a revered figure on a much dif-
ferent stage.
Celina Sotomayor was the unof-
ficial resident nurse in the family’s Bronx apartment building, always 
at the ready with her thermometer and blood-pressure cuff and some-times bringing meals to sick neigh-bors.
“If somebody didn’t feel well, 
and they were sick, she was there, to take their temperature and their pressure,” said Dinorah Tirado, 63, a former neighbor at Co-Op City 
and friend who knew the Sotomay-
or family for many years.
She also recounted how Celina 
Sotomayor would care for a sick 
neighbor at their building, taking 
breakfast in the morning before heading out to work and checking back in the evening.
Celina Sotomayor dabbed tears 
from her eyes with a tissue as the 
president and her daughter heaped 
praise on her for working two jobs as a nurse to support the family during tough times.
“I have often said that I am all 
I am because of her, and I am only half the woman she is,” Sotomayor said.
But the 81-year-old woman has said her daughter was the inspira-tional one.
“She’s the most honest. I wish 
I could be like her. She’s so good. She’s so giving. She has no errors,” a proud Celina Sotomayor told re-
porters this week in Broward Coun-
ty, Fla., where she lives.
The woman who raised the fu-
ture judge was born in 1927 in Lajas, a mostly rural area on Puerto Rico’s 
southwest coast.
After her mother died when she 
was young and her father aban-
doned the family, Celina Báez was raised by her older siblings. When she was in high school, she enrolled 
in the U.S. Army, becoming a mem-
ber of the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps, and the military sent her to work for a year in Manhattan dur-
ing World War II.
After leaving the military, she 
decided to stay in New York, where 
she met her future husband, Juan 
Luis Sotomayor, who was from the 
Santurce area of San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Her husband, who had a third-
grade education and worked in a 
factory, died when Sonia was 9.
They first lived in a 28-building, seven-story public housing project in the South Bronx, before mov-
ing up to Co-Op City, a massive housing development that was an improvement in their standard of living.
Celina was forced to work two 
jobs to support her daughter and son, Juan, but she always kept a pot of rice and beans on the stove and 
saved enough money to buy her 
daughter the only set of encyclope-dias in the neighborhood. Her nurs-
ing jobs included one at a metha-
done clinic and at a hospital.
Dr. Juan Diaz, a therapist at 
Hunts Point Multi-Services Center Inc. in the Bronx, said he remem-
bered working with the elder Soto-
mayor when they were colleagues at the methadone clinic.
He said that she was a “hard 
worker” and always talked about her daughter, Sonia. “She was al-ways dreaming and talking about 
her,” Diaz said.
“She was a terrific mother. Very 
giving. She made sure that the kids 
had the best education. She didn’t make a lot of money,” Tirado said.
Celina Sotomayor worked until 
retiring in the 1990s, after meeting her second husband, Omar Lopez, who worked at an auto parts store.

ment community in Margate, Fla.TUESDAY, JUNE 2, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 9

PARIS — French President Nicolas Sarkozy 
said the prospects of finding any survivors from 
an Air France jet that disappeared over the Atlan-
tic Ocean carrying 228 people are “very small.”
Sarkozy said “no hypothesis is excluded” in 
the search for causes of the 
disappearance of the Rio to 
Paris flight.
Sarkozy met Monday at 
Paris’ Charles de Gaulle airport with some of 
families of those aboard the plane, including “a mother who lost her son, a fiance who lost her fu-
ture husband.”
Sarkozy said, “I told them the truth. The pros-
pects of finding survivors are very small.”
He said finding the plane “will be very diffi-
cult” because the search zone “is immense.”
He said France has asked for help from U.S. 
satellite equipment to locate the plane.Sarkozy: Chance

For Dulce, 14 months without cornstarch is a very good 
thing.
As a Maltese puppy, Dulce suffers from glycogen stor-
age disease type 1A, a disease found in both dogs and hu-
mans that prevents the body from converting glycogen to 
glucose, the essential fuel to keep bodies in motion.
The current treatment for the disease includes frequent-
ly administering corn starch in order to keep blood sugar in 
check. Before 1971, the disease was considered fatal.
The UF Glycogen Storage Disease Program is hoping to 
transform current treatment methods after its recent and successful attempt at gene therapy in dogs.
Maltese dogs, the only known animal to suffer from the 
naturally occurring disease, are more prone to the disease 
because they have been inbred for years, said Dr. David 
Weinstein, the director of the program.
Though Maltese are no strangers to international dog 
shows like Westminster Kennel Club, puppies with the dis-ease are not among the prize-winning show dogs.
“Without treatment, the dogs with the disease could die 
within an hour of birth,” Weinstein said.
Gene therapy has helped Maltese puppies live longer by 
removing the original genetic material from a liver-and-kid-
ney-attacking virus and inserting a desired gene sequence. 
The altered virus is injected into the body, where it attacks the liver and inserts the desired gene, Weinstein said.
Prior to gene therapy, no Maltese with this disease had 
survived for more than 28 days. 
Dulce is now 20 months old and has been off all treat-
ment for 18 months since her last gene therapy session in January 2008, he said.While helping puppies is a worthy cause, Weinstein said 
the ultimate goal is to find a viable, effective treatment for humans who suffer from the disease.
Of the 12 types of glycogen storage disease, type 1A is 
the most severe and causes low blood sugar, or hypogly-cemia.
Even with cornstarch, patients with type 1A can suffer 
from liver cancer, severe kidney disease, osteoporosis and other complications, Weinstein said.
“Children and adults with glycogen storage disease live 
by the clock,” he said.
Precise amounts of cornstarch are 
consumed about every four hours, and a delayed dose will result in severe hypo-
glycemia, which can lead to seizures or even death, he said.
“One missed or delayed dose can be 
disastrous, and this causes tremendous anxiety for patients and families,” Wein-
stein said.
Because safe gene therapy in humans is a long way off, 
Weinstein said, UF researchers are working on an extended-
release cornstarch that could be available as soon as 2010.
“(The cornstarch) may finally allow people with (the dis-
ease) to sleep through the night,” he said.
Weinstein said UF has been the exclusive site for these 
studies since the program moved from a branch of Harvard University to UF in 2005.
Despite groundbreaking work and more than 300 pa-
tients from 18 countries, budget cuts are threatening to end the program and any hopes for new treatments, according to Weinstein.
“We must be careful not to destroy great programs here 
at UF in an effort to save a little money,” he said.UF RESEARCHNew therapy may treat sugar illness

OKLAHOMA CITY – Three big 
plays and one dominant pitcher put 
the UF softball team one loss away from falling short of its season-long goal of a national championship.
Led by a two-hit performance by 
Danielle Lawrie, third-seeded Wash-ington (50-12) handed No. 1 UF (63-4) its first loss of the postseason, an 8-0 defeat in the first game of the Wom-en’s College World Series champion-ship series.
“Obviously that’s not the way you 
draw it up,” UF coach Tim Walton said. “Coming out in a national-cham-pionship series and getting run-ruled, it should have been a run-rule.”
The Gators had not given up eight 
or more runs since their 10-2 loss to UCLA on March 3, 2007.
Lawrie (41-8, 0.97 ERA) was domi-
nant in the circle for Washington, leav-ing UF’s hitters looking and swinging at pitch after pitch as she racked up 12 strikeouts.The junior pitcher, who competed 
for the Canadian national team in the Beijing Olympics, had already shut down the Gators’ potent offensive attack once this season in a two-hit, nine-inning shutout on Feb. 20, when Lawrie led the Huskies to a 1-0 vic-tory.
To leave Oklahoma City with a 
national title, UF will have to beat 
Lawrie, the USA Soft-ball National Collegiate Player of the Year, twice in a row – a feat only Stanford has accom-plished this season. The 
Gators will have a chance to get back at Lawrie tonight at 8 p.m. in Game 2 of the championship series.
“I really think we took way too 
many pitches,” said third baseman Corrie Brooks, who had one of UF’s two hits. “We really didn’t fight a whole lot. We’re definitely going to come out tomorrow and be ready to swing.”

It was a tale of two teams going in op-
posite directions
In one corner stood Miami, a power-
house year-in and year-out, who has made 
it to the College World Series 11 of the last 15 years.
But it was 11th-ranked UF, the No. 8 na-
tional seed, who earned the right to host a NCAA Baseball Regional this year.
UF and Miami met in Gainesville during 
the regular-season on Feb. 27 - March 1, and the ‘Canes swept all three games by a com-bined score of 26-8.
The Gators showed how far they have 
come over the weekend, sweeping all three games, including 8-2 and 16-5 wins against the Hurricanes.
UF will host Southern Miss, winners of 
the Atlanta Regional, in a best-of-three Su-per Regional this weekend with a berth to the College World Series on the line. 
This past weekend’s victory marked the first time in 11 tries that UF advanced out of a regional that also included Miami.
“We didn’t really talk about that, to 
be honest with you,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said of the long history of losses. “We’re not the same team that we were the second weekend of the year.
“The past is the past.”UF jumped out to a comfortable lead 
Sunday night, thanks to a five-run outburst 
in the top of the first. (The teams flip a coin 
to determine home-away. Miami’s win led 
to UF being in the away dugout in its own 
ballpark.)

Washington didn’t just punch UF in the stomach; the Hus-kies reached into the Gators’ 
collective chest and pulled out their 
still-beating heart like Jim Carrey in 
Dumb and Dumber. 
It’s one thing to lose a 1-0 pitchers’ 
duel the way UF did to Washington when the teams met earlier this season on Feb. 20. 
The way the Huskies hit around UF 
ace Stacey Nelson with such regularity is alarming. 
Nelson is the heart of this team, so 
it shouldn’t come as a surprise that when she started to struggle inside the pitcher’s circle, her team lost the abil-ity to play with any emotion or fire. 
After Kristina Hilberth’s third-
inning throwing error put the Gators in a 4-0 hole, the team looked down and out for the first time since I started covering the beat at the beginning of last 
season’s magical 
run.  Even when UF was down 5-2 heading into the final inning against Alabama 
on Sunday night, the team looked live-ly and capable of a comeback.  With Lawrie mowing down batter after bat-ter hope was no where to be found. 
Washington tacked on a two-run 
double in the fifth and a two-run hom-er in the sixth on its way to the highest scoring output by a UF opponent in more than two years.

ing up four earned runs for 
the second straight game. 
Washington put up four 
runs on Nelson on one play 
in the third when a bases-
loaded grounder by shortstop 
Jenn Salling went from bad to worse for UF. 
One run easily scored as 
the ball rolled into center field-
er Kim Waleszonia’s glove. 
Kristina Hilberth couldn’t tag Ashley Charters at home in time and, in an attempt to nail 
the runner at second, made a 
rare defensive error – just her 
third of the season.
The senior threw the ball 
back into center field, and it 
went all 220 feet back to the 
center-field fence, giving Kimi 
Pohlman and Salling plenty of time to cross the plate.
Salling jumped up and 
emphatically stomped her 
feet on the plate, having effec-tively stomped out the Gators’ 
chances against the Huskies.
“If you’re not used to do-
ing that, and that happens to you in that kind of a game, it’s tough to bounce back,” Washington coach Heather Tarr said. “All great teams have been there before, and they just obviously haven’t had that many losses to deal with.”
The Huskies scored two 
more runs in the fifth on a 
two-out double by Morgan 
Stuart, who leads all players with 10 hits in the WCWS, that bounced off the center-
field wall.
The next inning, sopho-
more pitcher Stephanie Bro-
mbacher replaced Nelson in the circle. Brombacher gave up a two-run homer to Char-ters in the top of the sixth and finished the day with two hits, two earned runs and two walks in two innings of work.
The Gators entered Mon-
day night’s matchup unde-feated in WCWS play after toppling ninth-seeded Arizo-na, fifth-seeded Michigan and fourth-seeded Alabama. Nel-son was dominant for the first two games, and a timely hit by a senior leader made the difference in the semifinals.
Gardiner’s two-out, walk-
off grand slam sent UF into the championship series, pushing her team past the Crimson Tide 6-5 despite en-tering the final frame down by three runs.
Before hitting the game-
winner, the senior first base-man was in the midst of the worst slump of her career and had gone 0 for her last 15.

World Series, Louisiana-Lafayette 
shocked the top-seed Gators and sent them into the losers bracket right off the bat. 
The media was prepared to head 
back to Gainesville the next day, and the fan base was rattled, but the team never showed an ounce 
of worry. Justified or not, they had 
a quiet confidence in themselves to 
come out and win as many games as necessary with their backs against the wall. Coach Tim Walton needs to do his best to find that team again before the second game of the championship series at 8 p.m. To-day or Washington will be the team leaving with its first ever national championship. 
But what I saw in the post-game 
press conference shocked me. 
I asked Nelson what the differ-
ence has been for her in her last two 
appearances, in which she has al-
lowed 11 runs, as compared to her first two shut-out gems against Ari-
zona and Michigan. 
“There’s just something that’s 
not clicking,” Nelson said. “I’m not hitting the spots that I want to, and I guess I’ll just go home tonight and figure out what that is.”
It wasn’t what she said, but the 
way she said it that startled me. 
She looked like a pitcher who just 
got upstaged on the biggest stage.
She looked like a pitcher who 
just let down her team.
And she looked like a pitcher 
who didn’t have the answers not only to my question, but to the more complex ones she’s sure to face on the field today and possibly tomor-row. 
I have never seen Stacey Nelson 
like that. 
UF’s ace is usually the most 
composed, worry-free player on the field. 
And the Gators will need her to 
be exactly that in order to dig them-selves out of their biggest hole yet.
“I really think we took 
way too many pitches.”

UF first baseman Preston Tucker is greeted at home plate by Jonathan Pigott after a home run during 
the Gators’ 16-5 NCAA Regional win against Miami on Sunday.Tucker wins MVP honors, sets single-season RBI record 
dy Foster.
Gators first baseman Preston Tucker, who took home 
Regional MVP honors, said UF got inspiration for its of-fensive breakout from watching Florida State’s game in the locker room before the game. The Seminoles scored 20 runs in the first three innings en route to a 37-6 win against Ohio State on Sunday.
“We figured, ‘Why can’t we do the same thing?’” Tuck-
er said. “We started getting guys on base early — one outs, 
no outs. Every time we got a runner on second or third, we 
scored them.”
UF blew the game open with a seven-run fifth inning, 
in which all of the Gators’ runs came with two outs. Tucker and Josh Adams hit back-to-back home runs during the barrage that included seven straight hits by UF batters. The Gators had 22 hits in the 16-5 victory on Sunday, matching a school postseason record.
Miami answered with four in the bottom of the fifth to 
close the gap to 16-5 but would get no closer. UF starter Alex Panteliodis went 4.2 innings and gave up five earned, but four pitchers (Patrick Keating, Nick Maronde, Tony Davis, Billy Bullock) combined to pitch 4.1 scoreless in-nings and shut the door. Keating (4-3, 4.66 ERA) picked up the win in relief.
“That’s kinda been our m.o. all year,” O’Sullivan said. 
“Two-strike hits, two-out runs. That comes from grit, and you grind it out and you don’t give in.
“Those two-out runs — they certainly give the team a 
lot of momentum and they certainly did tonight as well.”
Earlier in the weekend, UF got a tougher-than-expected 
opener against Bethune-Cookman. The Wildcats scored the first four runs of the game and led 7-5 going into the bot-tom of the ninth. Tucker scored on a Matt den Dekker RBI single and Gators catcher Teddy Foster answered with a one-out, two-run game-winning single to clinch a 8-7 win.UF hosts Southern Miss
� MIAMI HAD REACHED THE COLLEGE WORLD 
SERIES 11 OF THE LAST 15 YEARS.

Miami coach Jim Morris watched the last eight innings 
of his team’s season-ending loss from a locker room Sun-
day night.
That didn’t make it any easier to handle.The Hurricanes’ 16th-year manager was ejected by 
the home plate umpire after the first inning, and his team didn’t fare much better on the field as UF (42-20) swept the Gainesville Regional with a 16-5 win in front of a crowd of 2,351 Sunday. The No. 8 national seed Gators handed the ’Canes an 8-2 loss on Saturday night as well.
Miami (38-22) had made it to the College World Series 
in 11 of Morris’ previous 15 years and had been ranked as high as No. 2 in the National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association poll on March 23.
None of that mattered this weekend, however.“We’ve been to a [NCAA] Regional 37 years in a row, 
so making it to a regional doesn’t give you any reason to throw a flag up,” Morris said. “I’m spoiled being at Mi-ami, just like our fans and our players. All of us are very disappointed if you don’t win and you don’t go back to Omaha.”
Morris’ disagreement with home-plate umpire David 
Wiley began in the bottom half of the first — with Miami 
already trailing 5-1 —  when left fielder Chris Herrmann 
was hit by a pitch. Wiley ruled that Herrmann had leaned into the pitch and did not award him first base. Morris jogged down from the third-base coach’s box to argue the call for several minutes before walking back. Herrmann struck out one pitch later, and Morris appeared to say something to Wiley before turning his back and walking 
into the third-base dugout.
By the time Morris reached the first step of the dugout, 
Wiley had ejected him. 
When the coach realized what had happened, he 
rushed back to home plate, argued with Wiley and kicked 
dirt over home plate twice before two other umpires got between Morris and Wiley. 
The coach watched the rest of the game from a locker 
room inside the UF baseball complex.
“He said (Herrmann) put his elbow out over the plate,” 
Morris said. “I’ll let you watch TV and decide who was right and who was wrong.
“Personally I thought (the ejection) was uncalled for, 
but that’s my opinion.”
If the tirade was intended to inspire his team, the Hur-
ricanes’ pitching didn’t get the message. Prior to the ejec-tion, Miami starter Iden Nazario gave up five earned runs in 1/3 of an inning before being pulled. Even after Morris 
was sent off, the bullpen allowed Florida to put up 11 runs 
in the final eight innings, including a seven-run fifth in which all the scoring came with two outs.
“You can’t get down big early,” Morris said. “We 
walked guys and gave them opportunities and they took advantage of those opportunities. When you get down big against Florida … it’s going to be awful tough on any-body.
“It was a long eight innings to watch, whether you 
were on the field or in the locker room.”Gators hand ’Canes surprising exit BasEBaLL , from page 17By PHIL KEGLER

When Miami last came to town 
during the final weekend of Febru-
ary, UF freshman Preston Tucker 
was fighting for playing time and 
hitting sixth or seventh in the line-up. The ’Canes swept the Gators on that trip.
How things have changed.Now the Gators’ everyday first 
baseman and batting third, Tucker went 4 for 5 with three RBIs on Sunday night to help UF blow out 
Miami 16-5 and sweep the NCAA 
Regional.
His bloop single to center in the 
first inning drove in Avery Barnes 
and gave Tucker UF’s single-season 
RBI record, breaking Ryan Shealy’s mark of 80 in 2002. Tucker now has 83 with at least two games left to play next weekend in a Super Re-
gional.
“There’s just certain guys that 
when they come to the plate, every-
body stops what they’re doing and 
they watch,” Florida coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan said. “He’s got an air about him. He’s got confidence, and you can see it in his mannerisms. He’s been locked in for an awfully 
long time.”
It has paid off for the No. 8 na-
tional seed Gators (42-20) as well. 
UF is 35-13 (.729) when Tucker starts at first base.
The Southeastern Conference’s 
Co-Freshman of the Year earned Regional MVP honors after going  9 for 13 (.692) in three games over the weekend, including two home runs, six RBIs and a 1.231 slugging percentage.
“He wasn’t in the lineup the first 
couple weeks, and for him to battle and work, where he’s at — he’s a tremendous player,” UF center 
fielder Matt den Dekker said. “It’s 
probably one of the most amazing seasons I’ve ever seen. To do that, coming in as a freshman, to make that adjustment so quick — it shows 
how talented he is. He’s been a ma-
jor part of our success this season.”   
Both Tucker and O’Sullivan 
brought up all the adjustments and 
learning curve a freshman faces af-ter the game Sun-day.  The freshman slugger said he has 
been making ad-
justments all the way from the first 
game of the season until now and is still trying to adjust to the quicker 
speed of the college game.
To the casual observer, it might 
seem like his current production is 
just more of the same.  
As a junior at Tampa Plant High, 
he won the Hillsborough County Triple Crown, hitting .561 with nine home runs and 51 RBIs.   Two years later in Gainesville, Tucker is 
hitting .357 with 14 home runs and 
a .617 slugging percentage. He has struck out only 22 times in 230 at-bats, the fewest among six Gators with more than 150 at-bats.
He has even begun to become 
the subject of folk lore around Gainesville. Second baseman Josh Adams said he pitched batting practice to Tucker when he arrived in the summer and watched the 
freshman hit balls off the score-
board in right-center field, 375 feet away from home plate.
On two occasions on Sunday night, Miami coach Jim Morris brought in a new pitcher to face Tucker. 
He had a single in the fourth and 
then was hit by a pitch in the sixth against the new hurlers.
Through it all, the freshman 
humbly deflects praise.“The MVP goes to everyone 
swinging the bat,” Tucker said. “There’s always guys on base when I get up there. There’s a lot of pres-
sure on the pitcher.”
Then again, the way Tucker hits, 
there might have been pressure on 
the pitcher with the bases empty.

UF senior Billy Horschel leaves UF as a four-time All-American and one 
of the best golfers in Gators history. He plans to play professionally.

The Gators entered the NCAA 
Championships full of confi-
dence after a win at the South-west Regional, but that quickly changed as a dismal first round 
left the team searching for its 
swagger.
Unfortunately, the No. 8 UF 
men’s golf team never recovered and saw its season come to an early end at the NCAA Champi-onships in Toledo, Ohio. 
After a disappointing first 
round, the Gators could not fin-
ish the third day in the top eight 
and therefore missed the cut for match play and ended the event in 19th place with a score of 37 over par. 
Texas A&M went on to win 
the title after an exciting two days of match play.
“I can’t really say anything 
real positive occurred in Tole-do,” UF coach Buddy Alexander said. “We had some pretty lofty expectations going in.”
A first round score of 26 over 
par proved to be too much for UF to overcome.
One of the reasons the Gators 
got off to such a disastrous start 
were holes one through nine. 
In the first round, the team 
shot 30 over par over that 
stretch.
“That was a huge disappoint-
ment because it put us in a huge hole right out of the box,” Al-exander said. “Holes three to seven are just an incredibly hard stretch, perhaps the toughest five in a row that I know of in golf.”
Senior Billy Horschel saw his 
UF career come to an end.
He finished his last collegiate 
event with a score of 4 over par. It was only the second time this season that he has finished a tournament over par.
“It’s always tough to end a 
career at one place,” Horschel said. “It sucks because I want-ed the team to play well and it just wasn’t our week, and that hurt.”
Although he was  unhappy 
with the way he ended his col-legiate career, he didn’t let that stop him from reflecting on the 
past four years.
“These years were the best. If 
you look at what the other sports 
did while I was in school, it’s un-believable,” he said. “Then you look at the golf side of it, and being coached by Buddy, one of the best coaches in golf history, it means a lot.”
The other seniors, Toby Rag-
land and Will Strickler, shot 19 over par and 13 over par, respec-tively.
While the season had its high 
points, the Gators were never able to fulfill expectations of a conference championship and NCAA championship.
“I would say this season has 
been a disappointment, to be real honest,” Alexander said. “By UF and Buddy Alexander standards, I wasn’t happy with 
this year.” 
SENIOR NAmEd t O FOURtH All-
AmERIc A tEAm:
UF did receive some good news 
over the weekend, as Horschel was named to the Division I PING All-America First Team for 2008-09 season. 
He has made an All-America 
team in each of the four years he 
has played at UF, and this is the third time he has made the first 
team.
“There is no question that 
Billy was a terrific player, may-
be the best I’ve ever had,” Alex-ander said. “You don’t replace Billy.”
While his career as a Gator 
has come to an end, he will now take on another challenge.
“I’m going to try to play pro-
fessional golf now. We’ll see how it works out,” Horschel said.Season ends in disappointment

While some sports fans may know UF ath-
letics only for basketball and football, there is another team hoping for championship glory.
The top-ranked UF men’s track team won the NCAA East Regional in Greensboro, N.C., over the weekend, with 84 points, topping fellow Southeastern Conference opponents South Carolina and Georgia, who finished in 
second and third place, respectively.
The UF’s men’s team has finished in the top 
two of the East Regional every season since it 
began in 2003. 
But this is the first regional title for the men 
since 2004.  
The 16th-ranked UF women’s track team placed fourth with 48 points, behind Florida State, Penn State and Miami.
Calvin Smith came in second place dur-
ing the men’s 400m dash finals 
with a time of 45.30, breaking 
the facility record and earning him a spot in the NCAA Cham-pionships.
Junior Mariam Kevkhishvili 
won the shotput for the second straight year with a throw of 58-10.75/17.95m.The regional competition gave the Gators 
18 automatic qualifiers for the NCAA Out-door Championships in Fayetteville, Ark., on June 10-13.
There is a chance that more UF athletes 
will attend the NCAA Championships when at-large selections are announced later this week. 
“Our goal was to qualify as many athletes 
as possible,” Holloway said. “I think we were able to do that.” Men win NCAA East Regional, women finish fourthHorschel caps career as four-time All-American
