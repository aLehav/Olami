STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Ride service launches
By EMILY FUGGETTA
Alligator Staff Writer
efuggetta@a Iligator org
Gators will have a chance to party
with the president Wednesday night.
The Student Body president, that is.
From 8:30 p.m. to midnight at The
Swamp Restaurant, Student Government
will kick off its "Be a Smarty. Think Be-
fore You Party" campaign, designed to
reduce the number of student DUIs over
the next year.
"We want students to forget about
blood-alcohol levels and realize that the
only safe amount of alcohol when drink-
ing and driving is no alcohol," Johnson
said in an SG press release.
The "Welcome Back Kickoff Party,"
free and open to anyone 18 and older,
will celebrate the launch of FabulousRides, a new transportation service for
students who are out drinking and can't
drive their cars home.
Students can call 1-866-448-RIDE,
and the service will send drivers to meet
intoxicated students
on collapsible motor
scooters that will fit in
most trunks. The driv-
ers will then take the
students home in their
own cars.
Fabulous Rides also
offers service in town
cars, which are more luxurious versions
of taxis, and coaches, which can transport
20 to 30 partiers.
Free rides will be given during the
kickoff party and continue through Sat-

By JESSICA CHAPMAN
Alligator Writer
In less than a month, muggings in
Gainesville have decreased from as many
as 12 a day to five in the last two weeks.
Over the summer, the Gainesville Po-
lice Department saw a large number of
robberies along Southwest 20th Avenue
as students left bars early in the mornings,
but the number of robberies has decreased
significantly over the last few weeks, said
GPD spokesman Keith Kameg.
"But our numbers are still way too
high," Kameg added. "We want people to
be very aware of what's going on."
UF and GPD are focusing on making
students aware of the string of crimes that
occurred throughout the summer, remind-
ing them that the summer robberies couldstill affect the students.
Although the robberies around
Gainesville have mainly targeted students,
University Police Department spokesman
Jeff Holcomb said on-campus robberies
have not been as frequent as the city rob-
beries have been.
Local Only one robbery at
News Corry Village was reported
when the crime rate rose, he
said.
Holcomb said the biggest concern with
theft at UF was with small electronics, such
as iPods, laptops and cell phones, and bi-
cycles.
"Students are now in charge of their
own safety," Holcomb said of the usual fall
increase in crimes as students return for

By JIMMIE PAUL
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Southwest Recreation Center will be bigger and
better come Fall 2010 as a result of the demands made
by students, UF director of recreational sports David
Bowles said.
"The No. 1 demand from students right now
is cardio equipment."

More cardiovascular equipment and a track on the
second floor will be made available to students, he said.
The $16.3 million project, which is funded by the
Capital Improvement Trust Fund, is the solution to the
scant amount of cardiovascular equipment available at
the center.
Each student's tuition contributes $2.44 per credit

Senate discusses dropping NY Times
U SENATORS VOTED TO KEEPSG
OFFICIALS' PARKING PRIVILEGES.
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
After a late start, Student Senate kicked off
the fall semester with some heavy debate.
Orange and Blue Sen. Ben Cavataro pro-
posed a bill that would end parking privi-
leges for the eight Student Government of-
ficials who are allowed to park anywhere on
campus.
"Rules are applied to everyone regard-
less of what title they have in front of their
names," Cavataro said.
However, some senators believed SG of-
ficials deserved to keep their perks.
Unite Party Sen. Jesse Sherman said he'd
prefer if the executives didn't have to drive
around looking for a parking spot.
"The decals allow them to get their busi-
ness done," he said.
After 20 minutes of hearty debate, the bill
failed.
Senators also discussed the possible elimi-
nation of The New York Times readership
program on campus, where SG provides free
copies of the newspaper to students.
Cavataro said some of his constituents
have complained about the possible cut.
"We need a true national newspaper of re-
cord, which is what students want," he said.
Student Body Treasurer Maryam Laguna,
who stopped by the meeting to address the
issue, said no final decision has been made
to cut the program, adding SG is working to
keep both The New York Times and USA To-
day on campus.Eric Conrad, press secretary for UF Student Body President Jordan Johnson, address-
es the Student Senate at the first meeting of the fall semester Tuesday night.
Senators did pass a bill giving the Student
Body president the power to issue executive
orders to create offices, departments and pol-
icies. However, his orders can be overridden
by a two-thirds majority vote by the Senate.
During the bill's debate Orange and Blue
Party Sen. Alden Gillespy voiced his con-
cerns.
He said SG's legislative branch should not
be able to overreach the executive, and the
president should not be able to do something
without the approval of the Senate.
However, Progress Party Sen. Dave Sch-neider disagreed.
Schneider said the bill was necessary be-
cause it discourages too much centralization
of one power.
Debate also followed the Budget and Ap-
propriation's Committee's presentation of
the 2010-2011 proposed Activity & Service
Fee budget of $14.4 million.
Although committee chairwoman Virlany
Taboada assured questions concerning the
budget would be answered at next week's
meeting, some senators demanded their
questions be answered Tuesday.

celebrates
35 years
By HILARY SHEINBAUM
Alligator Writer
Freshman Ally Vitale is hop-
ing to see the bands Death Cab
for Cutie and Radiohead on a
daily basis -and she can be-
cause she is shopping to fill the
empty walls of her dorm room.
"When I found out there was
a huge poster sale, I instantly de-
cided that I was going to buy one
and put it anywhere that there is
white space on my dorm wall,"
she said.
The College Poster Sale Com-
pany began its back-to-school
sale Monday from 9 a.m. to 6
p.m. in the J. Wayne Reitz Union
Colonnade. The sale ends Friday
night.
The company, which sells
posters to about 300 universities
across the country, is in its 35th
year visiting UF.
"I would much rather buy
posters on campus than order
them on the In-
On ternet, where you
Campus have to wait for
them to be deliv-
ered," senior political science
and history major Jenna Stern
said.
There are about 1,200 differ-
ent posters to choose from, rang-
ing in price from $5 to $9.
"I'm looking for a variety of
posters, from pretty cutesy ones
to maybe some movie posters,"
said freshman English major
Gracie Svatek.
"Best sellers include 'Boon-
dock Saints,' 'Twilight,' Marilyn
Monroe and Vincent Van Gogh's
'Starry Night,"' said The Col-
lege Poster Sale Company presi-
dent Erol Liguori, adding, "The
strangest poster request was for
'Where's Waldo?"'
"Last year my roommates and
I bought a huge beach scene post-
er to cover up our dorm wall,"
Stern said. "We were able to find
something that we all liked and
it completely changed the room,
giving it a good vibe."
Liguori said prices haven't
risen since last year, but the se-
lection is bigger and there are
3-D posters available, including
Bob Marley and The Beatles Ab-
bey Road.
"The event has become the
heart of the back-to-school ex-
perience," Liguori said. "People
have come to know and expect
it.",
The College Poster Sale Com-
pany will return to the Reitz
Union Colonnade Jan. 11 to 15.

REGIONAL
SEC Web site highlights academic accomplishments
By JENNIFER TORMO
Alligator Contributing Writer
On game day, LSU and the
University of Tennessee are the en-
emies.
The rest of the year, LSU engi-
neering students are designing play-
grounds. Tennessee is helping guide
the search for water on Mars.
To show that SEC schools are
about more than sports, a new Web
site showcases the academics and re-
search at UF and the 11 other South-eastern Conference universities.
The SEC Academic Network was
launched last week by ESPN, the
SEC and SEC universities.
"There's a common perception
nationally that big southern schools
are big football schools," said UF
spokesman Steve Orlando. "But the
reality of it is that there is remark-
able research being conducted at
these schools."
Each school has a page contain-
ing five short videos outlining ex-
ceptional accomplishments."You'd be amazed to see how
many of our own students don't
Orlandorealize that Gato-
rade was invented
here," he said.
"The goal is to
make people stop
and think about
what their uni-
versity is really
about," he said.
Tyson Kindig,
associate of university relations at
the University of Arkansas, said thesite probably won't change fan fer-
vor, but he hopes it will spark inter-
est in academic accomplishments.
"As a conference, I don't think
we've done enough to establish an
academic brand," he said.
Researchers at Arkansas recently
worked to develop software that
scans and then virtually recreates
3-D digital representations of ob-
scure museum artifacts.
Mike Hill, associate athletics di-
rector at UF, said conferences like
the Big Ten and Ivy League are moreknown for academics than the SEC.
The site is a step toward enhanc-
ing the SEC's image as an academic
conference, he said.
Public relations junior Saman-
tha Fehr said she didn't realize how
much research schools like UF con-
duct until she became a student and
saw fliers for research studies.
"I feel like a lot of schools in the
South have a stigma," Fehr said.
"When you think of Ole Miss and
Tennessee, you think of Southern
belles."
UPD to enforce seat belt law
0 OFFICERS WILL BE STATIONED ON,
AROUND CAMPUS TODAY.
Buckle up, Gators.
The University Police Department will
crack down on unbuckled drivers and pas-
sengers today from 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.
in response to Florida's new seat belt law.
Under the new law, not wearing a seat
belt is now a primary offense instead of a
secondary offense, meaning officers can
stop drivers if they or their passengers are
not wearing seat belts.
According to UPD Lt. William Gainey,
officers will stop a car if anyone in the front
seat or anyone under 18 in the back seat is
not wearing a seat belt. Officers will give
warnings or citations depending on any
previous violations."The purpose of this saturation detail is
to educate incoming students -not to is-
sue a lot of citations," Gainey wrote in an
e-mail.
Officers will be stationed across the UF
campus and near the P.K. Yonge Develop-
mental Research School on Southwest 11th
Street.
Local Gainey said a focus willNews be given to the areas around
Kindercare and the Baby
Gator Daycare Center.
The seat belt saturation will kick off a
string of details to promote traffic safety.
UPD will conduct the details every other
Wednesday and will focus on different
traffic safety issues, like crosswalks, scoot-
er helmet enforcement and bicycle safety.

Pet Peeve
Lawmakers should ban
'reptiles of concern'
A 2-year-old girl getting strangled by her parents' escaped
Burmese python should finally convince Florida to ban
the sale of dangerous reptiles.
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission has
put restrictions in place to prevent this kind of tragedy, but none
of them managed to prevent Jaren Ashley Hare and Charles Ja-
son Darnell of Sumter County from mismanaging their pet.
As the law currently stands, Floridians can own a "reptile
of concern," which includes pythons, anacondas and moni-
tor lizards, as long as they pay a $100 fee per year, implant it
with a microchip and meet "strict caging requirements." Ac-
cording to an article in The Gainesville Sun, Hare and Darnell
discovered the snake had escaped from its glass cage earlier in
the day, hours before the child was asphyxiated. Vaguely tell-
ing someone to store his or her snake in a "reliable" cage is not
a "reliable" way to prevent irresponsible people from owning
dangerous animals.
We are not against infringing on personal liberties in any
way, but this is not analogous to something like the right to bear
arms. Guns, like snakes, can be owned by both responsible and
irresponsible people. But, unlike guns, snakes can act and move
independently of their owners and kill people, like infants, who
don't even have the manual dexterity to pull a trigger. Plus, the
"right to hang out with snakes and monitor lizards" isn't in the
Bill of Rights.
Reptiles such as Burmese pythons already pose a threat to
Florida's environment as an invasive species. Now that a hu-
man fatality has occurred, hopefully the Florida Legislature will
realize that the current law should be replaced by an outright
ban on "reptiles of concern."
Sober Scooters
Students who want tocelebrate their return to
Gainesville will have
a chance to do so safely on
Wednesday night.
As a way to introduce the
"Be a Smarty. Think Before
You Party" campaign, Stu-
dent Government will throw a
party of its own at The Swamp
Restaurant to celebrate a new
service available to students
called Fabulous Rides.
While SG cannot provide
the funds to make the service
free, Student Body President
Jordan Johnson's promotion
of the service as an alternative
to driving while intoxicated is
a good compromise.
Students are already aware
of other services that UF pro-
vides, such as the Later Gator
bus service, but may be wary
of them, as they force students
to leave their cars at Midtown
watering holes if they decide
they are not capable of driv-
ing responsibly. The threat
of towing may be enough to
get someone who shouldn't
be driving to take a huge risk.By recognizing the holes in
the Later Gator service and
promoting Fabulous Rides as
an alternative that allows for
students to leave with their
cars (and their lives), Johnson
is showing his commitment
to student safety is more than
just lip service.
We encourage students to
test-drive the service while
it's free this week. It's cheaper
than a taxi ride, and because it
uses your car, it's like having a
chauffeur. And hell, the mon-
ey you'd spend on Fabulous
Rides is probably equivalent
to the gas money you'd waste
circling the same five parking
spots for an hour or paying
for a spot in a parking lot.
Kudos to SG for recogniz-
ing the utility of this service.
Perhaps with us not having to
worry about that peskyblood-
alcohol content thing, we can
reclaim our spots as the No. 1
party school.
This may put a lot of faith
in a horde of scooter-wielding
strangers, but hey, we can
dream.

Column
Internet invites people to gossip more
ometimes, I think about how much the next genera-tion will change because of the Internet, and I feel old
in anticipation.
They'll never know what it's like to depend on the
radio or a physical store to select music for them. They
might never have to set foot in a library to do a research
paper. They'll probably never use paper maps or huge
yellow phone books. Even now, I haven't done most of
those things in years.
But along with the way the Internet has changed how
society gets information or entertainment, I wonder if it's
already making us careless about what we say.
Almost from birth, we learn we are responsible for ev-
ery syllable that leaves our lips. At age 4, I figured out
that when I talked back to the babysitter, my parents
heard about it. And in my teens, copy-paste instant mes-
sage conversations and the dangers of three-way calling
a la "Mean Girls" trained me to think about what I said.
Through the history of the world, whatever was said or
written could be traced back to the source with very lit-
tle detective work, with the possible exception of words
written in permanent marker on bathroom stalls. Over
the past five or 10 years, that's changed. Facebook has an
"Honesty Box," where anyone can comment on a Web
site anonymously, and bloggers can post their opinions to
the entire universe without having their names attached.
On Wednesday, a Manhattan judge ruled that Google
had to release the identity of an anonymous blogger who
made defamatory comments about fashion model Liskula
Cohen.
The blogger, 29-year-old Rosemary Port, didn't admit
to doing anything wrong -instead, she complained to
the New York Daily News that she felt her privacy had
been violated and announced plans to sue Google.What is it about the World Wide
Web that, at its most innocent, can
turn adults into middle-schoolers?
Granted, it's human nature that's
the problem, but the Internet seems
to make an excellent platform for
Hilary Lehman nasty behavior. Spreading informa-
letters@alligator org tion is power. And with anonymity,
it is power without any strings at-
tached. It's the rush that comes with writing an enemy's
name in graffiti without the risk of getting caught.
Scarily, this loss of accountability brings traffic to Web
sites. Sites like juicycampus.blogspot.com become popu-
lar by promising complete anonymity in exchange for ru-
mors about our neighbors. Rape victims see their names
posted on blogs and their characters vilified. News stories
about the shooting at the New York immigration center
get blown up with racist comments from anti-immigrant
readers.
And the public eats it up. We'll talk about how hor-
rible it is over wine at dinner, but we go home to our
computers and participate. If Paris Hilton wasn't called a
slut so often that she can't sue everyone who does, we'd
probably all be dealing with lawsuits.
There are no consequences for those who gossip or
slander anymore -only for the subjects of our gossip.
The power of ugly language is undervalued because it's
so easy to spread.
When federal judges become the principals scrubbing
obscenities off bathroom walls, I question whether inter-
active maps and search engines can outweigh society's
gradual loss of accountability and humanity.

Letter to the Editor
Teachers should abide by textbook law
So it's that time of year again: mass textbook buying.
Some would think that the law signed last year, the Text-
book Affordability Act, would help prevent some of the
usual headaches that are associated with buying required
textbooks.
Unfortunately, it is apparent in these first few days of
classes that professors have completely disregarded the bill,
which requires them to make it public knowledge 30 days
prior to class beginning which texts will be mandatory for
that semester. Thus far, I have had to purchase no less than
six books that were not made known to me 30 days prior
to the first day of class. Hence, I had to purchase them the
quickest way possible (bookstore) versus the most afford-
able way possible (Internet). Heck, they weren't even made
known to me until the first day of class.
Could the reason be that the law signed by Gov. Charlie
Crist does not state a penalty for those instructors or schools
that don't adhere to this law? This begs the question, what
the hell is the purpose of passing and signing legislation if
there are no repercussions for those who knowingly disre-
gard said law?
These professors are supposed to be role models, in-
structing students to abide by the rule of law. Yet, when it
comes to God knows what sort of backdoor dealings they
have with publishing companies and bookstores, the rule
of law gets tossed out quicker than the "Don't tase me, bro"
guy at a John Kerry rally.
This is a very disappointing precedent our instructors
have set in regards to following (or in this case, not follow-
ing) laws we may not be a fan of.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
UF grad files suit over SG records
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator org
A former UF student filed a lawsuit
against the university Tuesday, alleg-
ing Student Government employees
broke the law when they denied him
access to audio and video recordings
of Student Senate meetings.
Frank Bracco, who was a student
senator in the summer of 2008 and
served as Chomp the Vote executive
director, alleged in the suit that UF
denied him copies of records in three
instances and was unable to provide
them in two other instances because
the records had been destroyed in
violation of Florida's public records
laws.
Bracco, who graduated in May,
seeks copies of the records and repay-
ment of attorney's fees and costs.
According to the complaint, in No-
vember, Bracco requested the audio
and video of a Student Senate meeting
and was told about a month later that
his request was denied because the
records would be available online bythe end of February.
"Because the public will have ac-
cess to these meetings in a reasonable
amount of time, I do not feel this de-
cision hinders your ability to access
information from Senate meetings,"
wrote Center for Student Activities
and Involvement Director Nancy
Chrystal-Green in an e-mail to Bracco,
according to the suit.
"I've wasted 10 months of
my life trying to get this, a nd
I can't get it."
Frank Bracco
student senator in summer 2008
But February came and went with
none of the requested records posted
online, Bracco alleges.
Bracco then renewed his request
for the records and made a new re-
quest in June, to which UF responded
that he could view and listen to the
records in the SG office, according to
the suit.
However, the suit states the re-quest was for copies and not merely
the right to inspect the materials. Af-
ter many months of e-mails and con-
versations, the records have yet to be
released, Bracco alleged.
In two other cases, the records
Bracco requested were inadvertently
destroyed, according to the suit.
"I've wasted 10 months of my life
trying to get this, and I can't get it,"
Bracco said in a phone interview.
"My experience is not unlike what
others have experienced when deal-
ing with the UF, especially Student
Government," Bracco said in a news
release, "but I want to ensure others
have the right to access public docu-
ments in order to promote transpar-
ency and accountability."
Bracco also alleged in the release
that attempts to get Student Body
President Jordan Johnson to intervene
on his behalf were ignored.
A phone call requesting comment
from the SG office was not returned
Tuesday.
Eric Conrad, SG press secretary, de-
clined comment until he could gather
more information about the suit.

classes. "While theft is a problem, it's really easy to over-
come."
He said many electronics are stolen when students
leave their bags for a few minutes, thinking their belong-
ings will be OK until they return.
Holcomb added that the Student Nighttime Auxiliary
Patrol has extended its service by an
hour to 3 a.m. to help students remain
safe throughout the evening.
But despite the UPD and the GPD
attempts at awareness, industrial and
systems engineering senior Anna Kan-
tizios said students often don't pay
attention to the warnings and follow
Kameg safety precautions.
"They refuse to be aware," she said.
Kameg and Holcomb said as students return to cam-
pus it is important for them to pay attention to their sur-
roundings and never walk alone in the evening.
Kameg said a big problem with the robberies has been
with students not calling the GPD first.
"They call their boyfriend, their parents [and everyone
else], then us," he explained. "We really need students to
be our eyes and ears."

Hill impressing coaches, teammates in bid for snaps
By BOBBY CALLOVI
Alligator Staff Writer
bcallovi@alligator org
Withboth starting safeties from
last year's BCS national champion-
ship team returning and on pre-
season All-Southeastern Confer-
ence teams, Will Hill's chances of
expanding his role on defense in
his second year at Florida seemed
slim.
However, he has proven this
fall that he has the ability to be the
best safety on the team.
"He's been playing the
best on defense -me
and Brandon Spikes were
talking about it."
Joe Haden
UF junior cornerback
"He's been playing the best on
defense -me and Brandon Spikes
were talking about it," cornerback
Joe Haden said.
It hasn't just been the two pre-
season All-Americans praising the
sophomore safety.
UF coach Urban Meyer de-
clared Hill a starter for the Gators.
That doesn't mean he has taken
a job from returning starters MajorWright or Ahmad Black, who have
missed practices due to injuries, al-
lowing Hill more opportunities to
impress the coaches.
The emergence of Hill as a
"starter" has raised many ques-
tions about how time will be split
among all three safeties on game
days, but that isn't a concern of the
coaches quite yet.
"There will be some point
where we have to decide who
gets the majority of the snaps, but
we're not at that point yet," safe-
ties coach Chuck Heater said.
To give themselves more op-
tions, the coaches have had all
three players working at both
safety spots.
Meyer considers all of them
starters and plans to rotate them
at safety this season because he
doesn't want to have to use Hill
at the nickelback too much again.
Hill's progress since arriving last
fall has made it hard to take him off
the field, even if it has meant find-
ing time for him at other spots.
At first, Hill struggled to adjust
to the college football grind.
"Last year, he was going
through the freshman transition of
going through the heat, the pace,
the tempo and the expectations of
how to play a play," Heater said.

Pouncey returns to practice
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmcca ll@alligator org
Florida center Maurkice Pouncey partici-
pated in full-contact drills for the first time this
month on Tuesday.
"You could pick his energy up out there,"
coach Urban Meyer said. "When him and
[quarterback Tim Tebow] are in the lineup, it
elevates play a lot."
Pouncey overcame a torn labrum in his
shoulder, but that's not why he was held out
last week. Along with Tebow, linebacker Bran-
don Spikes and a few others, Pouncey stayed
on the sidelines so the backup players could
get more experience.
That didn't sit well with Pouncey, who
said he confronted offensive coordinator Steve
Addazio about it.
"We had a little going back and forth,"
Pouncey said. "He tried to hold me out, and Ijust told him I didn't agree with it, basically."
TH E D-LINE DOZE N: UF defensive line coach Dan
McCarney said Monday he hopes to have a 12-
man rotation, which would
give Meyer the most depth he
has ever had on the line.
"The best D-line we've had
was probably in 2006, and we
didn't have that many," Mey-
er said. "I don't see 12 -I see
eight -but he's a little more
Pouncey positive than I am."
MEYER NOT SET ON STARTING KICKER: Meyer
added that the kicking battle between return-
ing starter Jonathan Phillips and Caleb Sturgis
is still undecided.
"Phillips is going to get the nod if he's
close," Meyer said. "He has earned that, and it
means they'll both kick."Injuries always part of game
despite what you see on Sat-urdays or hear in jokes, Tim
Tebow is still only human.
Just like everyone else, he can
feel pain.
And yes, the pain does affect
him, but that doesn't mean it will
limit him come kickoff time.
After having surgery on his
shoulder, Tebow said he now
smiles instead of grunting when he
gets hit.
Even with the pain, he contin-
ued to play, which not only shows
his strength and determination, but
also the willingness of most football
players to play with pain.
While Tebow has, without ques-
tion, played through his share of
injuries, probably even when he
shouldn't have, he is just like most
other football players in that as-
pect.Just because he has a sore back,
it doesn't mean that it is time to
worry for Gators fans.
Football is a violent game, result-ing in large
quantities of
bumps and
bruises.
R a r e l y
does a player
Bobby Callovi feel good all
Bobby's World over heading
bcallovi@alligator org into gameday.
M o s t
players will have their share of sore
spots, tweaked body parts and ach-
ing muscles.
But come game day, things start
to feel better. The knee that limited
you in practice all week suddenly
feels ready to go. The bad back and
stiff neck that made it tough to get
out of bed each morning now can
bend any way necessary if that
means helping the team win.
With only 13 -or 14, if you're
lucky -games a year, this makes
football players different from most
other athletes.

Fraine embraces role as Florida's primary keeper
Berlingo transferred to Washington State
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
Katie Fraine has tunnel vision.
And while that may seem like a
scary thought for the UF soccer
team, considering Fraine is the
team's starting goalkeeper, it's the
best thing possible.
That's because Fraine's vi-
sion has her looking only straight
ahead.
"It's exciting for me to finally get
to be the No. 1," Fraine said. "But
it's also like in the back of my mind,
'You have to keep it.' I'm ahead and
everyone else is on their horse try-
ing to catch me."
Last season, Fraine split playing
time with Meghan Berlingo. Fraine
started 10 matches and played in
two others. Berlingo started in 14
matches.
Berlingo transferred to Washing-
ton State at the end of last season.
"In the beginning, it was frustrat-
ing because you'd get your mind in
it for one week and then out of it
the next week," she said. "Basically,
I wanted to explore my options and
see if there was a team that I could
make a complete impact on."
Berlingo took it up with UF
coach Becky Burleigh and the two
talked it over."It was an uncomfortable situa-
tion for everybody," Burleigh said.
"(Meghan) wasn't happy, Katie
wasn't happy. We weren't abso-
lutely happy, either."
The switch worked out for ev-
eryone involved.
Berlingo said she keeps in con-
tact with her teammates and there
were no hard feelings.
"I'm still best friends with all the
girls," she said.
Having a two-headed goalie
system allowed the team to excel
(19-4-1 in 2008), but sometimes the
goalies felt they were stalling.
Even Fraine's seven-save game
against then-No. 4 FSU on Sept.
7 last season didn't save her from
sitting the next game. She had six
saves the following game but al-
lowed two goals and believes if she
had not sat out, she may have been
able to capitalize on the rhythm
from her FSU game.
"Before, I felt like sometimes I
was playing a bit scared, just be-
cause I felt like, 'Oh, I can't make a
mistake because then (Berlingo's)
going to totally win it over,"' Fraine
said. "I wasn't playing to my poten-
tial as much as I think I'll be able to
this year."
One goalie's transfer is another's
opportunity."That's a decision for (Meghan),
it's going to work out in my favor
and I wish her the best of luck,"
Fraine said. "I feel like I can finallyplay the way that I want to play."
Fraine seems to be at ease about
being the sole No. 1 and feels her
teammates trust her as the de facto
starting goalie.
"For me this summer, it wasabout reproving myself and just
hitting the nail in the coffin," Fraine
said. "Making sure that everybody,
hands down, knew that it was my
turn and nobody could take this
from me."

Hill shined in limited role in '08
HILL, from page 18
"It was really a struggle for him, and
it took a while for him to get a hold
of it."
Hill said the toughest part was
treating every practice like a game,
because in high school he was able to
just go through the motions.
Once he adjusted to the difficulty
of the college game, he began to show
his teammates and coaches why he
was so highly recruited out of high
school.
Hill was on numerous high school
All-American teams, won New Jer-
sey's Player of the Year award twice
and was the highest-rated player at
his position, according to Rivals.com.
As last season progressed, Hill'srole expanded from special teams to
the nickelback, and he finished sixth
on the team in tackles with 48, includ-
ing a team-high 22 special teams tack-
les.
Hill was able to shine even in his
limited role, with his biggest per-
formance coming against Kentucky
when he finished with
a team-high 11 tackles.
Not many could
question his athletic
Football ability or talent, but it
has been the effort he
has put in off the field
that has made the biggest difference
for him this year.
"I go in and watch extra film,
watch the receivers every day and go
out to practice and go 100 percent,"
Hill said.BOBBY, from page 18
They can't afford to sit out a game to refresh
their legs or miss one just to get over a cold
because that one game could determine their
team's chance at a championship.
This doesn't mean they are all willing to
risk a serious injury in exchange for a national
championship, but it does mean those smaller
injuries don't seem that painful.
Tebow has shown throughout his career
he has no problem playing through pain if it
means another victory for the Gators.
He is the first to admit that he will never
take himself out of a game, but then again,
most players won't as long as they can stand
up and hold their arms up without excruciat-
ing pain.
Is that a healthy attitude? Absolutely not,but in the mind of a football player, everything
can wait until after the season.
All that matters is that your hurt shoulder
or bum knee can last until offseason surgery.
My senior year of high school, I played the
entire season with a torn labrum in my left
shoulder. It was not fun, and even after sur-
gery, my shoulder is still not right, but I never
thought about calling it quits that year, even
on a 3-6 team.
I have a feeling Tebow may have a slight
lead on me in the toughness department, so
if I can play hurt, I'm sure he has no problem
with it.
Tebow will have some new injury that
limits him in practice this season, but there is
no need to worry because come Saturday he
will be out there lowering his shoulder into
the chest of defenders along with the 21 other
people on the field playing with pain.

PAY FOR PLAY
Many barriers block path to paying college athletes
Editor's Note: This is the third of a four-
part alligatorSports series in which we ex-
amine whether college athletes deserve
to be paid for their athletic efforts.
By LAURA KUBITZ, KYLE MAISTRI and
MIKE McCALL
Alligator Writers
Even big schools like UF have struggled fi-
nancially in the past.
In all, UF's athletic program brought in
$106 million in 2007-2008 against $98 million
in expenses.
Administration and the general costs of
running the University Athletic Association
used 22 percent of the budget. The operating
costs of the football team were 16 percent of
the budget, and money for scholarships occu-
pied 8 percent.
Although the revenues outweigh the ex-
penses now, this has not always been true. In
the late 1980s and early 1990s, the UAA spent
more than it had coming in. Throughout the
2000s, the UAA broke even with its budget.
Only since 2006 has the UAA had surplus
revenue, according to the budget summary.
With Florida only recently turning a profit
on sports, athletics director Jeremy Foley said
there's no chance other schools would be able
to afford paying their athletes.
"You'll never see that rule passed," he
said.
Dr. Ruth Alexander, a former UF profes-
sor and an expert in sports management and
finance, said 80 percent of college football pro-
grams lose money, including 60 percent of Di-
vision I schools."Revenue to a college program depends on
many factors which change every four to six
years," Alexander said in an e-mail. "So many
colleges are struggling to just pay scholarships
to athletes, let alone salaries."
With such an unpredictable source of in-
come and a large outstanding debt, it would
be difficult to generate a fair system of paying
student-athletes.
If college athletes were to be paid, there
would be several hurdles to clear. First, the
NCAA would have to amend its laws, whichTampa sports talk radio host Dan Sileo said
are outdated.
"This is not like 1956 when the first NCAA
rules and bylaws were put in," said Sileo, who
played football at the University of Miami in
the 1980s. "Back then, coaches were making
$15,000 a year and it was a cute business. The
education then still outweighed anything the
coach did."
Currently, college athletes are not classified
as employees, leaving the NCAA and its mem-
bers free to reap the rewards from their play-

to be employees in court, they'd gain the right
to unionize and take part in collective bargain-
ing under the National Labor Relations Act.
In lieu of such a ruling, many proposed
payment systems would only pay the athletes
who made money for schools, but generally
the only sports that make money are football
and men's basketball.
To only pay student-athletes on teams that
generate revenue would violate educational
amendment Title IX, which states that female
athletes must have the same opportunities and
benefits as men. Sileo believes only athletes on
revenue-generating teams should be paid and
that Title IX needs to be revised.
"I think the kids who are on the women's
basketball team, they're lucky they have pro-
grams like Florida football and Florida bas-
ketball," he said. "They're getting a scholar-
ship out of it, and they're lucky they're even
in the building because if it wasn't for those
football and basketball teams, they wouldn't
be there."
Sileo said paying players a stipend of a few
hundred dollars per month would be doable
for programs like Florida, and it would help
curtail the under-the-table payments he wit-
nessed while playing for UM.
Despite the fact that larger programs would
have the ability to pay more than smaller ones,
Sileo doesn't think it would create a recruiting
advantage beyond what already exists.
"When Central Florida goes to the Liberty
Bowl and Florida goes to the BCS National
Championship Game, $17 million is going to
Florida while $1.2 million is going to UCF," he
said. "There's already a built-in economic im-
balance in the type of bowl games they go to."
