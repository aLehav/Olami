St. Patrick’s Day may fall on Sunday this year, but 
green tinsel and shamrocks can already be spotted 
around Gainesville. Local bars and restaurants are ﬁ  -nalizing orders, hanging decorations and adding last-minute preparations for the Irish-themed holiday.
Nicholas Smith, general manager of The Swamp 
Restaurant, said he feels his staff will be able to handle waves of green-colored customers.
“It being on the weekend is deﬁ  nitely going to be 
busier than if it fell during the week,” he said.
At Mother’s Pub & Grill, owner Patrick Schaller 
plans to start pouring the green beer early Sunday by opening his bar at 7 a.m.
“We started opening early last year for the ﬁ  rst 
time,” he said. “We’ll be doing that as a tradition from 
now on. We had about 15 people waiting for me to 
unlock the door last year, and as soon as I did, it grew to 40 or 50 people.”
Gator City Sports Grill and Grog House Bar & Grill 
have also begun preparing for the big day by stocking up on alcohol.
Jonathan Gold, Gator City general manager, said 
his bar ordered seven additional cases of Jameson Irish Whiskey. Meanwhile at the Grog House, general man-
ager Patrick Smith said his bar ordered almost three 
times as much beer and liquor as usual.
He plans to open his doors at 4 p.m. in honor of the 
holiday.
“We’re putting most of our focus on Sunday,” he 
said. “But we know the whole weekend will be fes-tive.” Local bars

Texting while driving may be illegal by the fall, and 
some Gainesville residents are considering the implica-
tions of the proposed law.
House Bill 13 and Senate Bill 52 would create the “Flor-
ida Ban on Texting While Driving Law.” It would allow 
local police ofﬁ  cers to ticket drivers for texting but only if 
they were pulled over for another offense.According to the bill, “A person may not operate a mo-
tor vehicle while manually typing or entering multiple let-ters, numbers ... into a wireless communications device or while sending or reading data in such a device.”
However, the bill makes exemptions for drivers using 
their cellphones to navigate, get safety information or re-port emergencies to authorities.
The bill, which is being reviewed by committees in Tal-Texting while driving could soon be banned

SCRAPS IN A FIVE-GALLON BUCKET.

Waste from leftover food collected in UF’s 
Alpha Chi Omega chapter house’s kitchen 
could soon be composted.
Gainesville Compost would use its bike-
powered transportation ﬂ  eet to pick up the 
waste weekly, owner Chris Cano said. He said the partnership has not been ﬁ  nalized, but it 
should be in the next few weeks.
“It would be our ﬁ  rst sorority partner, but 
we are always open to new connections,” he said.
The house would receive a ﬁ  ve-gallon bin 
to collect raw food scraps with instructions on what could be composted. Gainesville Com-post would use the waste to use as soil for local gardens instead of having it go to a landﬁ  ll.
Carley Anderson, an intern at Gainesville 
Compost, forged the relationship as part of a group project for a UF course. Anderson, a 20-year-old UF sustainability studies junior, said the project centered on community and behavior change using sustainable methods. Two Alpha Chi Omega sisters in the group thought it would be a good idea to start in UF’s Greek community, Anderson said.
“I’m excited to have one sorority jump on board,” she said. “It’s nice to have them inter-ested and starting a green initiative.”
Somi Aggarwal, an Alpha Chi Omega sis-
ter and group member in the project, helped facilitate the partnership. The 20-year-old UF 
psychology junior said the house already do-
nates leftover food and scraps to local farm-ers.
“We would just like to do more, and we 
think it would be a good partnership,” she said.

House Bill 13 and Senate Bill 52 would create the “Florida Ban on Texting While 
Driving Law.” It would allow local police officers to ticket drivers for texting.
If passed, the bill could have positive effects on campus, UPD says
lahassee, would take effect Oct. 1. It would 
also allow points to be assessed against a driver’s license for texting in a school zone or causing a crash because of texting.  
Peggy Johnson, a driver’s education 
teacher at Gainesville High School, said the bill would help cut down on distraction among teenage drivers.
“Being in high school, I see it all the 
time,” she said. “They can’t do without their phone.”
Johnson said catching people in the act 
would be hard, but enforcement would be the key to the law’s effectiveness.
“All we can do is try,” she said.University Police spokesman Maj. Brad 
Barber agreed, adding that enforcing the bill could present challenges.
“It would be difficult for officers to ob-
serve the offense taking place,” he said.
Even though texting and driving could 
be tricky to enforce, Barber said the bill could have positive impacts on UF’s cam-
pus.
“Distracted driving in the traffic mix that we have on campus is always a concern for 
us,” he said, “and certainly texting is a sig-
nificant distraction.”
Daniel A. Smith, a professor in UF’s po-
litical science department, said he was sur-
prised a bill addressing texting while driv-ing hasn’t been adopted yet.
“This is a bill that is a long time in com-
ing in Florida,” he said, noting that other states have already implemented similar laws. “We’re behind the times.”
He said lobbyists representing major 
communications companies have been in-fluential in warding off a texting ban until now.
“I think it speaks volumes to the tele-
communications lobby in the state,” he said. “They are very powerful in Tallahassee.”
Ross Baugher, a 19-year-old UF mechan-
ical engineering freshman, said he thinks 
the bill will generally be accepted.
“I think most people will support it,” he 
said. “I do think, though, you’ll find some 
resentment — especially among the college-age group.”

In the U.S. News & World Report graduate school rank-
ings released Tuesday, UF programs placed in the categories of 
“Best Business Schools,” “Best Engineering Schools” and “Best Education Schools,” among others.
The Hough Graduate School of Business saw the most im-
provement. Last year, the school ranked 19th among public schools and 44th overall. This year, it rose to 15th among public universities and 36th overall.
Director of Hough Graduate Programs Selcuk Erenguc said 
he is glad to see the school recognized as one of the top Mas-ter’s of Business Administration programs in the country. He attributes the improved score to top-quality students, a world-class faculty and a great administrative staff.
“We’re not complacent, though,” Erenguc said. “We are in a 
continuous improvement mode in all aspects.”In fact, the school is currently in the process of updating and 
improving the curriculum.
The College of Engineering ranked 38th overall and ranked 
third in biological/agricultural engineering. The college’s Di-rector of Communications and Marketing Helen Goh said the school does not linger on the rankings.
“We say, ‘Oh great, very nice,’ and then we move on,” she 
said. “[It] is obviously important … for grad students choosing what program to apply to. But it’s not the only set of metrics we use to measure our performance.”
The other programs, though ranked highly, approach the 
future in a similar way.
“[Our ranking] is a continuation of a high national stand-
ing,” said College of Education Director of News and Com-munications Larry Lansford. “But we’re shooting for even higher.”
The College of Education ranked 30th among public educa-
tion colleges and 40th among both public and private universi-ties.
Lansford points out that though the college decreased by six 
spots, it should not be seen as a decline.
“We improved in five of six quality measures that [are used] 
to evaluate the school. In the variables that are objective, we improved,” he said. “We’re on an upward climb.”

After serving nine years with the Nation-
al Guard, a 26-year-old UF public relations 
senior dreamed of going to culinary school. 
Now, because of budget cuts in the se-
quester, Staff Sgt. Alicia Slate’s dreams may 
crumble.
Tuition Assistance for UF military stu-
dents has been suspended for four of the five 
military branches: Army, Marines, Coast Guard and Air Force.
The program provided all full-time duty 
military students up to $250 per semester, with a $4,500 annual limit.
Eighty-six confirmed, and 50 more stu-
dents could be affected, according to the UF Bursar’s Office.
Slate said she is not able to finish school on 
the same timeline as other students. She said the G.I. Bill only lasts 36 months, and she was planning to use the money from the tuition assistance program for culinary school.
“I’ve spent nine-and-a-half years serv-
ing,” she said. “I’ve done multiple tours 
overseas, including 39 months in a combat 
zone in Iraq. We put our lives on the line, and in return, we should be able to have the op-portunity to make a living for ourselves on the civilian side.”
The Army was the first to announce the suspension on March 8. Soldiers would no longer be permitted to submit new requests for assistance after that date, but those cur-rently enrolled in courses would be allowed to complete them without losing the funds 
they already have, according to a public 
statement made by the Army.
“The Army understands the impacts of 
this action and will re-evaluate should the budgetary situation improve,” said spokes-man Lt. Col. Tom Alexander in a public statement.
The Navy is still reviewing its options.Franklin Fields, a UF ROTC cadet, said 
this affects all active military students.
“It affects anyone who wants to pursue a 
college education and better their lives,” he said.
Capt. Dan Churchill, a former Public Af-
fairs officer with the U.S. Army, is now a public relations graduate student at UF. He said he thinks the suspension might affect military retention rates.
“Essentially, you are starting to break so-
cial contracts with people,” Churchill said. “They are not explicitly stated in contractual obligations to the military, but you are offer-ing all of these benefits, and then they come in, and you aren’t offering them anymore, so there could be some issues in the future.”
A petition on www.whitehouse.gov has 
received more than 100,000 signatures, call-
ing on the Obama administration to issue an 
executive order to reinstate the program.Active military students

25% NOToday’s question: Are you going to day-drink on St. Patrick’s Day?Humanity’s purpose with new technology
We’re approaching a time when things that were 
once impossible or outlandish will be common-place.
Last week, it was reported that a man had 75 percent of 
his skull replaced with a 3-D printed replica. That triumph 
is exciting on its own, but imagine what it tells us about 
the future.
Imagine walking into a hospital years from now and be-
ing able to print out a new knee or shin on demand, good as new.
Tissues of certain organs, like kidneys, can already be 
grown in a lab from stem cells. Imagine a future in which we could swap out our old, decaying organs for fresh ones.
Imagine something a little more exotic. Imagine losing 
an arm or a leg and then sprouting a new one like a star-ﬁ  sh.
It sounds crazy, but many scientists are working to make 
regeneration a reality.
In fact, several people have regenerated portions of their 
ﬁ  ngers. One man, a hobby shop worker, lost his ﬁ  ngertip to a model airplane propeller. Using a special powder, he was able to regenerate the ﬁ  nger, the nail and even the ﬁ  nger-print all with full sensation.
Now imagine the more distant future.We can already replace many of our original body parts 
with new ones when the old ones are damaged. Would it be unrealistic to think humans will one day replace already-working organic parts with new and improved ones?
Maybe people will swap out their old eyes for new ones 
that can see farther or toss out their old legs for new ones that can run faster. Maybe we’ll all replace our stomachs and intestines with solar panels and wires. No need to eat 
when you can power your body with the energy of the sun, 
right?
Transhuman thinkers say we’re going to enter this 
strange, new era very soon. Ray Kurzweil, a leading ﬁ  gure in futurism, predicts we’ll have crossed a major threshold to the transhuman era by 2045.
This threshold, called the Singularity, will mark a point 
when our technology will be able to outthink us.Should a future with artiﬁ  -
cial intelligence be feared? Mov-ies like the “Terminator” series depict a future of warfare with machines. Kurzweil says, rather 
than being separate from the ma-
chines, we will be one with them. Our bodies and minds will liter-ally merge with our technology.
Technologies interfacing the 
mind directly with machines al-
ready exist. Several paralysis victims who have had robotic arms attached to their brains are able to control the arms and perform simple tasks using brainpower alone.
In 20 or 30 years, we may be controlling many things 
with brainpower. Bank transactions, video games, social networking and more would all be done through our minds in a virtual reality.
Instead of imagining the future 30 years from now, 
imagine the future 100 years from now.
It might sound silly in 2013, but the time is fast ap-
proaching when humanity will be very, very powerful. Sci-ence, engineering and medicine are paving the way for a 
prosperous future.
What will we be like when we have so much power? 
I think nearly everything will have to change. First, 
though, I think we’re going to need to adjust our thinking on who we are as a species. I think we should ﬁ  nd some common causes to work on together.
Should we expand into the universe? Should we create 
beautiful art together? 
What should we do?
Take some time over the next few years to come up with 
some answers to that question. The Singularity is still a 
ways away, but we should be ready for it by at least com-ing up with some reasons to use the power of the gods with discretion and wisdom.

Have you looked at the Twitter account @_Florida-Man? It’s just a collection of the worst news head-lines because they all start with the words “Florida 
man” and end with something horrible. Here’s one to ponder: “Florida man shot neighbor’s cats, police say.” Well, that’s just great. “Andrew Straley, 34, told ofﬁ  cers he often shot at the cats with a pellet gun but was not trying to kill them, only scare them, according to a police report,” according to Click-Orlando. Thanks, Florida Man, for keeping our state awful.

If there’s one thing you should never do, it’s mess with 
the devoted fans of any super-popular TV show or movie 
franchise.  Don’t even tempt them. This week, a Kickstart-er was started by “Veronica Mars” creator Rob Thomas to fund a movie for the beloved, and canceled, show. “At one point Wednesday afternoon, by my monitoring of the online tote board, the project was raising $1,000 every 20 seconds,” wrote the Los Angeles Times. “By 9 a.m. Thursday, Thom-as had exceeded his stated goal — the amount a Kickstart project has to reach or the pledges are voided — by nearly 
$700,000, with 29 out of 30 fund-raising days left to go.” We 
give a  TV-lovers-everywhere-shouted-words-of-joy-at-their-laptops LAUREL to “Veronica Mars.” Congrats, everyone! 
We sure did it.
Hey, do you like to be scared by nature and what other 
countries are doing to it? Cool, so do we! This week, “Three Ukrainian commando dolphins trained to search for mines, attack divers and plant explosives have escaped from their handler in the Crimea, Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency re-
ported,” said a USA Today article. Isn’t that the craziest thing 
you’ve ever heard of? Would you ever think to be scared of dolphins? No. Not at all. Because dolphins are awesome and shouldn’t be trained to attack people or plant explosives.

“The world needs more fat people,” McDonald’s must 
have thought to itself in its crazy corporate brain. This week, 
“McDonald’s Corp will give away more than a million break-

opinions@alligator.org FRIDAY, MARCH 15, 2013  ALLIGATOR, 7
Two years ago, no one expected the string of revolu-
tions in the Middle East to spread to Syria. Presi-dent Bashar al-Assad was well-liked among the 
Arabs as one of the few leaders to espouse and promote the cause of Arab nationalism — even though we now re-
alize it was empty rhetoric. He stood up against the West, 
ensured Syria remained a stable, safe country (due to his tight grip), and Syria’s economy wasn’t too bad — no one really had complaints of him. Having gone to Syria, I knew no one could complain. The dreaded, omnipresent Mukhabarat (an intelligence agency known for its secret police) has been feared by Syrians for decades — a fear that I felt even here in America. I have been told by my family on numerous occasions to not talk politics or say 
anything about the president while in Syria, for my safety 
and the safety of my family.  
This fear has deﬁ  ned Syrian society and political life 
ever since the Ba’ath Party took over in 1963. Fear per-vades most Syrians. When protests broke out in Syria that day, as they naturally would in any oppressive country where teenagers would get arrested and tortured for writ-ing anti-government grafﬁ  ti, I was excited and anxious to see what would happen. People were unsure, afraid, 
hesitant. In fact, my parents told me adamantly not to post 
anything about Syria on Facebook, out of fear. I felt un-comfortable with the idea that the Mukhabarat were able to reach me even here in America. Would they detain me in the airport when I returned to visit Syria? I reasoned, however, that I wouldn’t return until after Assad fell, which I believed would be inevitable. Two years later, Assad continues to cling to power while he slowly burns Syria to the ground, with no end in sight. Innocent blood 
ﬂ  owed from the start of the March 15, 2001, revolution — 
blood that would spread the protest movement from city to city and harden the people’s hearts against this maﬁ  a-regime. Constant violence and bloody crackdowns on the part of the government turned a call for reform into a call for regime change and forced a peaceful revolution to turn into a self-defensive armed rebellion.
I am in awe of the Syrian people who have mustered 
extreme courage to break down the barriers of fear that 
have kept their mouths shut and their minds bound. I am 
in awe of the Syrian people who have displayed utmost strength and faith in dealing with the suffering this con-ﬂ  ict has brought about. I know my beautiful country has been ravaged, and I know its society has been torn apart by the sectarian-driven government. I know the constant rapes and killings, and mass detainments and bombings won’t be easily forgotten or forgiven. Yet I see examples of how people help each other, and I see examples of the 
sheer admirable determination these people exhibit for the 
success of their revolution, and I have hope. I have hope that Syria will come out of this conﬂ  ict, having learned and gone through a lot, as a better country with a brighter future. Progress, education, democracy, dignity and free-dom will no longer be shackled under a cruel, oppressive dicta-torship.
Things have changed in the 
past two years. It’s amazing how 
desensitized I’ve become to the 
daily death toll, now accepting 115 people killed in one 
day as normal. And we forget the people and focus on the politics sometimes — we lose sight of the original spirit of the revolution, of the roots of this uprising. As a Syrian-American, I look back at the past two years, and I realize how much this revolution has affected my life and con-sumed my time and attention. I have felt nostalgia for the old Syria, the Syria I once knew, the Syria I miss and yearn 
to visit, knowing it won’t be the same. I have seen a coun-
try I never thought would be destroyed bleed.
Having used all kinds of weapons possible, Assad has 
killed more than 70,000 people in Syria. He has displaced more than four million people, creating the largest mod-ern internally displaced person crisis in the world. More than one million Syrians were forced to ﬂ  ee their homes as refugees in neighboring countries, and about 40,000 are ﬂ  eeing Syria every week. Some of my family and friends 
have been imprisoned, their houses burned, their spouses 
killed, displaced, and the list of troubles facing every Syr-ian goes on. What can you do, though? That is a question that has been in my head for as long as I can remember. What is the solution?  How, when, will it end? I am sad-dened there seems to be no end in sight. The international community has so far failed at solving the crisis in Syria. Unfortunately, I see my country bleed and burn as larger political powers maneuver their chess pieces, disregard-
ing the humanitarian disaster in Syria. The way geopoli-
tics works, the way our double-standard international community functions, the way our political interests trump our humanitarian ethics absolutely disgusts me. Like most Syrians, I have lost trust in the international community that has allowed this atrocious bloodshed to continue happening in Syria. I invite all of you to actually do something — to turn activism into action.
Join the Student-Led Movement to End Mass Atroci-
ties today, and call 202-647-4000 to be connected to the State Department comment line, and leave a message for Secretary Kerry urging him to increase humanitarian as-sistance to the more than one million Syrian refugees and to ﬁ  nd a solution for the conﬂ  ict. For more information, go to www.syriasly.org/syriasly-call-secretary-kerry/.

Speaking Out
It’s game over for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences. They had a chance to be groundbreaking. They had a chance to write a new cultural narrative.
Instead, they showed fear. What they did is quite ironic, 
given the name of the movie they chose as they played it safe.
“Wreck-It Ralph” should have won the Oscar for Best Ani-
mated Feature Film of the Year.
“Brave” was OK, but “Wreck-It Ralph” held the hopes of a 
community. “Wreck-It Ralph” validated the place video games 
have in our society. An Oscar would have reiterated that. 
“Wreck-It Ralph” was this generation’s “Toy Story.” In hind-sight, because it mirrored “Toy Story,” it should have been ob-vious that all “Wreck-It Ralph” would get was a nomination.
Think about it: “Toy Story” got robbed because enough 
well-made animated movies could have rearranged the entire industry. The Academy had to snub it, lest directors and actors jump ship. The 
subject matter of “Wreck-It Ralph” 
jeopardizes the industry instead of just threatening to rearrange it.
Get past common multiplayer 
games, and it’s easy to see why: The best story-driven video games can 
easily replace movies. The stories that carry them are just as incredible, if not even more so, as anything a movie can deliver while engrossing the player for a longer amount of time than 
a movie can.
I’m biased, though. I like video games.
Let’s take IMDB’s views. Head-to-head, “Brave” man-
ages only one win, which comes from the number of reviews. “Wreck-It Ralph” rated 7.9 out of 10 from more than 75,000. It has a Metascore of 72 out of 100. “Brave” rated more than half a point less — 7.2 — from more than 100,000 users with a Metascore of 69/100.
Well, what about Rotten Tomatoes? “Wreck-It Ralph” 
cleans house there, too. Eighty-six percent of approved critics gave it a positive review with an average of 7.4 out of 10, and it has an average rating of 4.2 out of ﬁ  ve. “Brave” comes in at 78 percent with an average of 6.9 out of 10 and averaged 3.9 out of 5 stars.
Why the blatant snub? The Academy is scared. No movie 
with a video game basis has ever won an Academy Award. Ever.  Maybe the Academy should ask newspapers how disre-garding technology-based cultural shifts worked out for them.

After an action-packed three years that included bringing hun-
dreds of jobs to Gainesville and diffusing Quran-burning threats, 
Mayor Craig Lowe says he’s ready to take reins of the city once again.
Lowe, 55, is running for re-election for mayor in Tuesday’s 
Gainesville city elections on a platform of bringing more jobs to the city and boosting local businesses.
Lowe said he points to the city-facilitated expansion of Innova-
tion Square and Prioria Robotics as his crowning accomplishments during his past term as mayor.  
“We’ve seen an unparalleled period of high-quality economic 
development in our city,” he said.
He also mentioned his involvement in helping Silver Airways 
relocate its maintenance unit to Gainesville Regional Airport.
“We’ve now seen a doubling of the number of airlines serving 
Gainesville and a tripling of the number of nonstop destinations since I first became mayor,” he said.
Lowe said economic development tied to job creation is pos-
sible only if the city appeals to potential employers — an environ-ment Lowe said he has helped foster.
“We’ve created an environment in Gainesville that very much 
centers around quality of life … which in turn is very attractive for businesses to locate here and to expand here,” he said.
Lowe said he will also bring seasoned leadership to the office 
if re-elected.
Because of his participation in the World Conference of Mayors 
and his crisis management during the Rev. Terry Jones’ threats to burn copies of the Quran at his church in 2010, Lowe said he can chart a steady course of diplomacy.
“When the world spotlight was on Gainesville, I was able to 
represent Gainesville in a favorable light, asserting what the true character of our community is,” he said. “I’m the one candidate for 
mayor that has actually represented our city on the world stage.”
In 2003, Lowe was elected to the City Commission, where he 
served for seven years until his successful bid for mayor in 2010.
Nick Mildebrath, Lowe’s campaign manager, said Lowe is good 
at forming and explaining his plans to politicians and the public.
“There’s a lot of nitty gritty details involved in that,” said Mil-
debrath, 24. “Craig is definitely a great policy mind.”

Pete Johnson wants to take 
Gainesville from good to great.
“My dream is if you raise a 
family here and your kids want 
to live here, they’re going to find 
plenty of opportunity to stay 
here,” he said. “They don’t nec-essarily have to move because of lack of economic opportunity.”
Johnson, 59, is running for 
mayor in Tuesday’s city elections on a platform of making the city more business friendly, increas-ing access to information, and 
promoting an open and respectful 
government.
If elected, Johnson said he 
wants to boost business growth by making regulations more un-derstandable.
“I respect the rules and regu-
lations we have, but we ought to make it as easy for anyone to learn 
what they are and how to abide 
by our rules and regulations,” he said.
He said he believes in partici-
patory leadership and encourages public comment, adding good ideas from the public deserve 
more attention.
“I think we would set the stage 
for moving this city from being a 
good college town to a great city,” he said.
Johnson moved from New 
York to Gainesville in 1978 to at-tend UF. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in business 
administration in 1979 and then 
spent the next 30 years in business leadership roles. He also served on the Gainesville-Alachua Coun-ty Regional Airport Authority board from 2004 to 2009.
Johnson went into politics fol-
lowing his time with the City Plan Board because it “really crystal-
lized in my mind that the city 
could use a different style of lead-ership.”
“My background in business 
and running different companies, and starting a leadership institute at UF made me feel like I could bring something different that could help change the culture,” 
he said.
Kim Mitrook first met John-
son in 2007.  She said Johnson is 
well-rounded and stays true to his roots
“He’s very honest. He’s very 
straightforward,” she said. “I think that’s unusual for politi-cians. He understands the plight 
of everyone.”8, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, MARCH 15, 2013

Zack Yanger wants change — pocket 
change, that is.
On his quest to become a millionaire, 
Yanger, a 24-year-old 2010 UF advertising 
graduate, is asking 4 million people for a 
quarter.
Yanger said he got the idea a couple 
of weeks ago when he was talking to his 
friends about ways to make money. Joking-ly, he thought he could become a millionaire off of people giving him change.
Two days later, he launched the website 
www.makezackamillionaire.com.
“I want to basically show the true pow-
er of digital sharing in today’s society,” he said. “Four million people is a lot of people, but when you think about it, there are You-Tube videos with hundreds of millions of views.”
But there’s a catch. If he reaches $1 mil-
lion by his deadline of Sept. 1, all the money goes to charity. If he doesn’t reach the $1 mil-lion mark, he gets to keep what he earned.
Anyone who donates a quarter has the 
opportunity to say where he or she wants the money to go, Yanger said. Donors also have the option to vote for other people’s re-quests. The request with the most votes gets 
the $1 million.
Yanger said some of the requests have 
been to donate the money to a sorority, pay 
someone’s rent, give it to the Ronald Mc-Donald House, build a Publix in New York City or give it to a random homeless per-son.
Greg Slepak, a 25-year-old UF computer 
science senior, said people have become 
millionaires off of the Internet before, so he 
thinks the goal is possible.
It’s admirable that Yanger would give it 
to charity, Slepak said.
Yanger said by getting more people on 
board with his social experiment, he’s posi-tive he will make it to the $1 million mark for charity.
“I guarantee there is a quarter in arm’s 
reach of you that you don’t need,” he said. “You can part with a quarter for a cause.”
Quarters can be donated on the website 
through Paypal. On Wednesday, Yanger said he had $5. Having accepted donations since March 1, Yanger expects to get about 500 donations by the end of this week.
He won’t accept $1, $100 or even $1,000.“All I want is a quarter from 4 million 
people,” he said.
Paul Numbers, a 20-year-old UF civil 
engineering sophomore, said he thinks the goal is possible, and he would consider do-nating.
“It’s only a quarter,” he said. “I don’t see 
why not.”

Even though right-hander Jonathon Crawford has not 
been his best this season, coach Kevin O’Sullivan liked what 
he saw from his junior ace in a bullpen session on Wednes-day. Crawford is returning to his sophomore form, which made him one of the top draft prospects heading into this year.
On a starting staff struggling to pitch 
deep into games, Crawford (0-2, 4.22) has pitched at least six innings in his last two starts.
But he’ll have to wait an extra day to 
take the next step when Florida (8-10) hosts No. 10 Kentucky (14-2) in its SEC opener Friday night at 7:30.
Freshman right-hander Jay Carmichael (2-1, 2.00) will 
open the series in his first career start. Crawford will go on Saturday and right-hander Eric Hanhold (0-1, 6.39) will throw the first pitch in Sunday’s game.
Carmichael tossed 5.2 innings of relief against Indiana on 
Saturday. Freshman takes over No. 1 spot in Gators’ starting rotationADAM LICHTENSTEIN

Kelsey Stewart stood on third base, 60 feet from 
scoring. 
Instead of waiting for sophomore Bailey Castro to 
drive her in, Stewart took the initiative.
Fellow freshman Kirsti Merritt, who was stationed 
on first base, broke for second, distracting the Auburn 
defense while Stewart ran to the plate and scored eas-ily, getting Florida on the board first on Saturday. 
“As soon as I see the ball, it was like, ‘I’m going,’” 
Stewart said. “I heard coach (Tim Walton) screaming at me, but I was like, ‘Coach, I know.’”
Stewart’s steal of home came in a 5-4 loss to the 
Tigers, but her speed has been key to No. 3 Florida’s (25-2, 2-1 
Southeastern Conference) suc-
cess this season.
Through 27 games, the freshman second baseman 
has stolen 23 bases and has yet to be caught stealing. Her stolen-base total is more than double Merritt’s, who is second on the team with 10 swiped bags.
Stewart’s speed on the base paths has led the Gators 
to a stolen-base percentage of 91.9, with Stewart accu-mulating more than 33 percent of the steals.
“I’m just trying to work for the team,” Stewart said. 
“Base hits, getting to the next base, not being forced out. Or if I am, sliding into the player so that it’s not a double play.”
When Stewart gets on first, she is an immediate 
threat to take second. Fortunately for Florida, she has the opportunity to take extra bases often.
In addition to leading the team in steals, Stewart 
leads the team in batting average with a .409 clip and 
in runs with 29. She is second in on-base percentage at 
.486.
“It really is almost every single into a double,” coach 
Tim Walton said. “Whether she hits a double or gets on first and steals second.”
Stewart has motored around the bases through-
out the season. She has five triples; no one else on the team has more than one. Stewart turned a deep fly ball against Savannah State on Feb. 15 into Florida’s only Freshman poses

Forty-six seconds were all coach Billy Donovan 
could handle. 
In the opening minute of Florida’s 61-57 road loss 
to Kentucky on Saturday, Florida fell behind 4-0 af-
ter a series of mistakes. Unhappy with his group’s effort, Donovan called a timeout after UK’s second basket. 
Despite Donovan’s early cry for more intensity, 
the Gators struggled in the first 1:22 of the second half, allowing the Wildcats to begin another 4-0 run.  
Again, Donovan called a timeout.“I am disappointed in our team’s fire. I don’t see 
it,” Donovan said Monday. “It is pretty evident if you look at the way the Kentucky game started. … Erik Murphy gets pushed out of the way on an offen-sive rebound by a (Alex) Poythress, layup. Then he 
goes down into a post move and Willie Cauley-Stein 
blocks his shot out to halfcourt.”
No. 13 Florida’s lack of “fire” is a trend Donovan 
saw in practice the past three weeks. The Gators have 
a 3-3 record during that span. 
Florida averaged 75.4 points in its first 12 SEC 
games. But in their past six contests, the Gators have scored only 62.6 points per game. 
“We are not playing with fire and passion right 
now. Not like we did against Marquette or Wiscon-
sin or some of these games we have played in our 
league,” Donovan said. 
“I don’t think it is about making shots or miss-
ing shots or any of those things. I just think that our perseverance, our resiliency needs to continue to get 
better. They have to enjoy the struggle a lot more. 
They have to enjoy the struggle in practice and those kinds of things.”
Added forward Will Yeguete: “The way we start-
ed games the past couple games, I think we should do a better job just coming out and being excited and being ready to play. We’ve been missing that the past couple games.”
Florida’s rebounding numbers have dwindled. 
The Gators have been outrebounded in five of their past six games. In their first 12 conference games, they outrebounded eight of their opponents. Florida hoping to regain intensity

  The Gators lacrosse team, un-
beaten through 10 games, is off to 
the best start in program history.
  While playing against ﬁ  ve top-20 
opponents, including two ranked in the top ﬁ  ve, Florida has relied on a consistent offensive attack led by se-
nior Kitty Cullen.
   Cullen has scored at least one 
goal in all 10 games.
  She will be looking to extend 
her streak when No. 2 UF takes on Oregon (4-1) at Pape Field in Eu-
gene, Ore., 
at 4 p.m. The streak 
has not sur-
prised a conﬁ  dent Cullen.
  “I think as a starting attacker, it’s 
kind of my job to get goals in every 
game,” Cullen said.
  Cullen has scored two or more 
goals in eight of Florida’s 10 games. She is second on the team in total goals with 25 and ﬁ  rst in points 
with 32. Fifteen of her 25 goals came 
against UF’s ﬁ  ve top-20 opponents. 
  She is the Gators’ all-time scoring 
leader with 177 career goals and is second in points with 224.
  Cullen credits her coaches for putting her in the right spot to ﬁ  nd the open lane. She said “her spot” tends to be ﬂ  anked left from the goal and she just waits for the ball to ﬁ  nd her. 
  “I’ve been able to generate a lot of goals because of the different coach-ing plans the coaches have given us,” Cullen said.  Florida’s offense is averaging 
14.4 goals per game. Cullen said the team’s balanced attack is the reason for the offensive success this season.
  “The one big thing that separates 
us from a lot of teams this year on the attacking end is that every girl out there can score,” Cullen said. “Whether it’s the players coming off 
the bench that haven’t started or the 
starters that are out there, every sin-gle one of us is a threat. Teams can’t just shoot one or two of us down be-cause all seven (of the attackers) can 
score.”
  Six Gators have already sur-
passed double-digit goal totals this 
season. After scoring a season-high 
18 goals against Lehigh on Tuesday, 
UF does not appear to be slowing.
  Coach Amanda O’Leary credits 
the team’s seniors for providing the offensive spark, especially Cullen, 
who has scored ﬁ  rst for the Gators 
in half of their games.
  The last time Cullen failed to 
score a goal came in a 14-13 double-
overtime loss to Syracuse in the Fi-
nal Four last season.
  “Throughout her years here at 
Florida, [Cullen] is willing to put her head down and get that ﬁ  rst goal,” 
O’Leary said. “That’s just her men-
tality.” 14, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, MARCH 15, 2013

  Caroline Hitimana is dynamic on the court.
  The senior has seen limited playing time this season, 
but a pair of recent singles wins in Southeastern Confer-
ence play helped prove her abilities.
  Hitimana defeated Madison Rhyner 6-4, 6-2 in singles 
at Missouri earlier this month. 
  Against South Carolina, Hitimana earned a second 
decisive win. Her 6-2, 6-1 singles victory against Joseﬁ  n 
Andersson gave the Gators a 5-0 lead against the Game-cocks. 
  Hitimana is 17-1 all-time in SEC dual matches.   Although the lineup is not ﬁ  nalized 
for today’s match against No. 12  Geor-gia at 5 p.m. at Ring Tennis Complex, Hitimana hopes to be given the opportu-nity to help Florida.
  The Gators clinched the 2012 SEC 
championship against the Bulldogs last season.   Hitimana was the deciding fac-tor in singles play.
She held up through three sets against UGA’s Alina 
Jerjomina and clinched match point for UF with a 7-5, 4-6, 6-4 win. 
  Getting into the thick of SEC play, Florida coach Ro-
land Thornqvist said Georgia (10-1, 3-0 SEC) is the team to beat in the conference.
  The No. 4 Gators (9-2, 2-1 SEC) have won two of their 
three SEC matches this season. Their lone loss came against Texas A&M on March 3rd.
  Thornqvist blamed the loss on a lack of focus.
  “We’ve talked a lot to our players in raising our lows,” 
Thornqvist said. “And I can feel it coming,” 
  He added the team is growing stronger in doubles, 
which is critical against a Georgia team that boasts a 53-15 doubles record. 
  “We’ve never really had three doubles teams play well 
in one match,” Thornqvist said. “If you’re going to try 
and win anything, you got to be able to win at all spots. We’re getting closer to that now.”  Senior hoping to assume larger role in Florida’s lineup

In Matagalpa, Nicaragua, flash floods are a 
part of everyday life.
Villagers are forced to cross torrential rivers 
due to heavy rainfall just to reach a local market. 
“When I was there, I saw people walk through 
this river, and it rained the night before,” Kiersten 
Wang said. “They were walking, holding kids on 
their shoulders in waist deep waters.”
In Summer 2011, Wang traveled to Nicaragua 
with her father Tim, a civil engineer for CH2M 
Hill, and students from Rice University to aid a nonprofit organization called Bridges to Prosper-ity. 
They surveyed a bridge project in Barrio Lu-
cidia Mantilla to provide a safer route to markets, clinics and schools for more than 500 locals. 
“I loved getting the community involved to 
a build a bridge that they really needed,” Wang said.
But when she was there, Wang could not help 
but notice Matagalpa’s poor living conditions. 
People took to garbage for shelter, and with no 
vehicles, they were forced to cross the unsafe riv-er by foot. 
Wang said the water is contaminated. Up-
stream, just yards away from the survey site, was 
a water treatment plant that dumped chemicals 
into the river. 
Just a half-mile down, she says, kids and fami-
lies were taking baths and washing their clothes 
in the murky water. 
“This is a third-world country we’re talking 
about,” Wang said.
By the end of 2012, 
the 147.6-foot bridge was finished, but for 
Wang, it was just the 
beginning.
Two years later, she has decided to pursue 
a career in civil engineering. Her father did not pressure her to pursue his profession. 
“He never really tried to force it on me,” Wang 
said. “He thinks it’s cool now, and he’s definitely willing to help me out.”
In her senior year at Monument, Colo., Palmer 
Ridge High, Wang took up the course “Intro to Engineering.” There she developed an interest in pulleys, towers that supported weights and ma-
chines built to hold marbles. 
“I called it advanced Lego’s,” Wang said. 
Her mentality has carried over into the gym 
where the sophomore has hit collegiate-bests on both floor and vault with scores of 9.875 and 9.9. 
Coach Rhonda Faehn says it’s a rarity to find a 
student-athlete as committed as Wang. 
“She’s just very disciplined,” Faehn said. “She 
came in day one as a freshman knowing that there 
is life after gymnastics. She’s not happy if she 
doesn’t get straight A’s.”16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, MARCH 15, 2013

The Gators are coming home. 
Playing in the SunTrust Gator 
(Women’s) Invitational at Mark Bostick Golf Course for the 41st-straight year, Florida’s women’s 
golf team begins its only home 
match of the season today.
“We’re excited to be playing 
at home this weekend,” coach Emily Bastel said in a release. “This only happens once a year for us, so we’re anxious to have 
all the teams 
in, showcase 
our golf course 
and give our hometown  fans some-thing to cheer about.”
Florida be-
gan the spring 
season strong with a win in the 
Florida Challenge but ended 
February with a disappointing tenth-place finish in the Allstate Sugar Bowl.
UF has won the past two 
Gator Invitationals but will face stiff competition this season. 
The tournament has just 15 
teams that are competing, but 
seven of the teams are ranked in 
the top-25 of the WGCA/Coach-es’ Poll, including second-ranked reigning national champion Ala-bama, No. 4 North Carolina and No. 6 Oklahoma. 
“Alabama is a pretty good 
team because they won nation-als last years,” sophomore Ca-milla Hedberg said.
“Oklahoma is good, too. 
There are several good teams in the field, so even though we’re playing on our home course, we still have to play good golf.”
Hedberg is considered Flori-
