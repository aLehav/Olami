A six-legged surveillance robot made by Gator Robotics sits on a table in front of the Reitz Union Tuesday afternoon to at-
tract potential new members. Freshman Steve Charles, who saw the robot, talked to electrical engineering major Adam Rozenberg and computer engineering major Daniel Nunez to learn more about the organization.

Gone are the days of sneaking friends 
and family members into Ben Hill Griffin 
Stadium, at least for the first two games of the Fall 2011 football season. 
The Gator Student Ticket Office is al-
lowing students to buy extra tickets for guests in the student section of the stadi-um for the first two games of the season. There are 1,300 tickets available for each game, said assistant athletic director Mark Gajda.
Tickets cost $50, and guests will receive 
seats right next to students who pick up the tickets, according to an email sent to UF student season ticket holders Sunday.  
Gajda said the ticket office used to make 
the same offer often but hasn’t for the last five years. 
The tickets will be available for UF stu-
dent season ticket holders first, and they will be made available to all UF students and the public later.
Gajda said the office had a ticket sur -
plus because fans of UF’s first two oppo-nents didn’t use all of the seats they were allotted. The extras come back to UF. Ga-jda cited football fans’ tighter budgets as a reason the seats may have gone unsold. 
“It’s harder and harder to travel now-
adays with the economy,” Gajda said. “People just don’t have the disposable in-come.”
Florida Atlantic University was allot-
ted 4,000 tickets for the Sept. 3 game and returned 3,000 of them to UF, Gajda said. The University of Alabama at Birmingham was allotted 5,000 and returned 3,800. 
After the 2,600 tickets were allotted to 
students as guest tickets for the FAU and UAB games, the remaining 4,200 tick-ets will be sold to the public and athletic boosters, Gajda said. 
The ticket office has 21,500 UF student Extra tickets 
on sale for students

Baar said the man’s friend had

Students now have two more ways to 
work on their fitness at UF.
Country Line Dance and iBurn are two 
new group fitness classes offered on cam-
pus at the Southwest Recreation Center and the Student Recreation and Fitness Center. 
So far, both classes have proven popu-
lar among students, said Ambre Sheehy , a fitness coordinator for the UF Department of Recreational Sports.
The popularity of the new group fitness 
classes is not surprising, Sheehy said.
“I expect most classes to be successful 
because it is the beginning of the semester,” Sheehy said. “We started offering Country Line Dance during the summer, but it is new to UF students who were not on cam-pus during the summer.”
Group fitness classes are free for UF 
students currently enrolled in classes and who have paid the activity and service fee, Sheehy said.

UF Hillel is starting the school year off 
with a paint-filled bang tonight at the first Art 
for the Jewish Heart event of the semester.
Participants will discuss how Judaism 
or other traditions view the inner self as op-posed to the outer self. They will then ex-press this dichotomy by throwing darts at paint-filled balloons.
“It’s about breaking out of your shell and 
letting your colors shine,” said Jordan Bar -
rish, a spokeswoman for Hillel.
Now in its second year, Art for the Jewish 
Heart is a program that connects art medi-ums with Jewish learning through monthly events. In the past, participants created pot-
tery to tie in to the lesson that man is made in God’s image. 
Amanda Solomon, the 
Hillel arts director, said she bought more than 500 balloons for the event that 
she hopes will draw 20 to 30 people.
“It should be a very 
therapeutic project,” she said.
The event will be held at UF Hillel and 
will begin at 7 p.m. Participants are advised to wear clothes that can get dirty.Hillel to combine art, Jewish

If you drive 20 minutes south 
from Gainesville on U.S. 441 and 
hang a left just before the “Wel-come to Marion County” sign, you’ll end up on a narrow, two-lane road that seems to take you back in time.
The road dead-ends in front 
of Evinston United Methodist Church. 
To the right are cow pastures. To the left, within spitting 
distance from the county line, is Wood and Swink Old Store and Post Office, established 1882. 
Wood and Swink’s post office 
is one of 3,700 slated for closure by the United States Postal Ser -
vice. 
Without the business of the 
mail, former owner Freddie Wood Jr. said, the future of the historic shop is uncertain. 
The only Gainesville post of-
fice that will be closing is located at 401 SE First Ave.
“It’s a meeting place,” Wood 
said of the store. “People get their mail there in the morning and get to see each other and get to talk. If we lost [the post office], we’d lose that.”
Wood’s family settled in 
Evinston in the late 1870s, when mail came into the town via rail-road. 
His grandfather owned Wood 
and Swink from 1910, then passed it to Wood’s uncle, then his par -
ents. 
Wood inherited the store after 
his mother’s death in 1990, more than 40 years after his father first put him to work there at the age of 12. 
Wood turned the store over to 
his son Fred two years ago but still works around the store in the afternoons, after he finishes working on his farm. 
Through the mid-1980s, Wood 
and Swink was a full-service gro-cery store, but business has now dwindled to sales of homemade pickled hot peppers, cold drinks and trinkets. A few dusty shelves in a corner of the shop contain old vinyl records, sold for a dollar apiece. Without the revenue from the mailbox rentals, Wood said, that money wouldn’t be enough to keep the store afloat.
There are 85 pick-up mailbox-
es in use at the store, give or take a few, postmaster Scarlett Kinder said. 
If the post office closed, box 
holders would have to arrange for rural delivery to their homes. 
A representative from USPS 
will come to talk to Evinston resi-dents about the potential closure at some unspecified date in the near future. 
Just about everyone in town is against it, Wood said.
Since Wood and his wife, 
Wilma Sue Brown-Wood, still have their farm, the store closing wouldn’t put them in too much financial trouble. 
But the social impact of clos-
ing, Wood said, would be huge for Evinston.
“It just takes something away 
from me,” he said. “It would sure affect me not being able to talk to everyone. Old, young, male, female, black, white — doesn’t matter. I like them all.”  
Katie Deadenick used to have 
a mailbox at Wood and Swink but had to close it when she moved to McIntosh. 
Now she brings her children, 
Mark and Maggie, to the store as a treat. 
She waits with the car running 
while they rummage around in the drink cooler and pick out three-cent pieces of bubblegum.
“A lot of people count on this 
place,” Deadenick said. “We’ll be sad to see it go.” 
The residents of Evinston 
heard about a month ago that the post office might close. Since then, Wood said they’ve written to politicians, asking them to in-tervene. 
They just don’t see how clos-
ing Evinston’s humble post of-fice will save USPS very much money.
A better solution, Wood said, 
would be to charge a mailbox fee to urban residents, for whom mail delivery is free.
He believes forcing people 
who live in rural settings to pay expensive fees for mail delivery or taking pick-up boxes in big-ger towns that are farther away is unfair.
“It’s another nail in the coffin 
for rural America,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 31, 2011

Last-minute shoppers still have a few days left to pur -
chase their posters. 
Although the poster sale on the Reitz Union Colon-
nade was advertised to end last Friday, posters will be 
available to purchase until the end of this week.
The College Poster Sale Company presents the poster sale for two weeks each fall but has a different sales repre-sentative each week, said Jill Keezer, the assistant director of programs, arts and leisure at the Reitz Union. Each sales representative markets his or her sale as a 
one-week sale.
“We have found that many students have not received 
their financial aid by the first week of school,” Keezer said. “So by popular request, we extend the sale the sec-ond week.”
Students can purchase posters from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.About 90 percent of the posters on sale, of which about 
30 percent are changed to adapt to the market each year, are priced under $9.
The poster sale will return in the beginning of the 
spring semester for one week.Reitz poster sale continues through end of this week

Student Government kicked 
off its first Senate meeting of the 
fall semester with a few represen-tative changes, comments about block tuition and a budget pre-sentation.
Budget and Appropriations 
Committee Chair Andy Mason presented the 2012-2013 Activity and Service Fee Budget, which is proposed to be $17,558,432. 
The new budget would in-
crease funding by 5 percent for SG, RecSports, the  Reitz Union and Student Activities and In-volvement. The Reitz Union and SAI split over the summer.
The 2012-
2013 budget will not be finalized until it is ap-proved at each of the next two Senate meet-ings, which are scheduled for 
Sept. 6 and Sept. 13. 
Written amendments to the 
budget can still be presented, and Senate will accept questions at the next two meetings.
Nominees to the Election Com-
mittee were also  approved. Stu-dent Body President Ben Meyers endorsed his choice over speak-erphone on a cellphone held to the microphone.
Student Body elections are 
scheduled for Sept. 27 and 28.
Meyers also addressed the 
Senate in person and discussed block tuition.
He said block tuition sup-
porters claim the system would encourage students to graduate 
faster. 
However, Meyers said that 
push was unnecessary because 
UF’s four-year graduation rate in the last year jumped from 58 per -
cent to 64 percent. 
Meyers said the Student Body 
deserved the credit for that jump. 
He pointed out that students 
paying their way through UF will likely graduate earlier because of financial reasons.
Meyers said he hoped to tell 
the Senate next week after a Board of Trustees conference call that block tuition had been “put off indefinitely.”Meyers 
talks block tuition; SG budget proposed

U.S. misplays hand in 
‘war on drugs’
The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Ex-
plosives did its best to wipe the  blood off of its hands when its acting director, Kenneth Melson, resigned Tues-
day. 
When you lose track of 2,000 guns resulting in the death of 
an American citizen, someone has to take the blame. 
In a recent operation called “Fast and Furious,” the Phoe-
nix division of the ATF, with the help of the U.S. Attorney for Arizona (who is also resigning), attempted to track the flow of guns on the Southwest border by allowing weapons to be purchased at border gun shops. 
Soon, the ATF found they were missing about 2,000 guns, 
which ended up in the hands of Mexican drug cartels. 
The operation was brought to light when U.S. Border Pa-
trol Agent Brian Terry’s body was found near Rio Rico, Ariz. Terry was murdered by members of a cartel who had stumbled upon, if you will, two assault rifles that were part of Operation Fast and Furious. 
This tragic scenario was just another horrible result of the 
U.S. position toward Mexican drug violence. 
Drug cartels operate exclusively underground with the pro-
tection of many Mexican government officials who have been paid off with bribes. Did our government really think they would be able to track the flow of our weapons in a corrupt Mexican government? 
The government spends billions of dollars on the war on 
drugs, which has become an international conflict, and we have seen few positive results.
According to the Cato Institute, 131 U.S. citizens were killed 
in border cities between 2005 and 2008 due to the violent drug trade. Around 6,290 people were killed in Mexico in 2008, ac-cording to USA Today. 
Yet we keep spending billions on the drug war. In a struggling country like Mexico, the extravagant life of 
a drug kingpin is very tempting to many, even some govern-ment officials. What we are left with is a system of corruption, bribery and increased crime. 
Instead of putting guns in the hands of violent international 
criminals, the government should be reevaluating its ineffec-tive War on Drugs. 
Perhaps they could learn a lesson from the alcohol prohibi-
tion era instead of using scare tactics and increased invasions of privacy to monitor the flow of illegal substances in and around the United States. 
They could also find smarter ways to decrease the power of 
drug cartels by removing the perverse incentives that prohibi-tion creates. 
The implications of this prescription might be alarming to 
some, but surely there must be a better way to prevent this vio-lence. 
Replacing the head of the ATF or the Drug Enforcement 
Agency or even the Department of Justice will not do any good until the government reevaluates its entire policy surrounding this issue.Guest column
I have often heard it said that communism sounds 
good in theory or principle but does not succeed in reality. Stalin and Cuba serve as examples. Hayek 
and von Mises are quoted. On the historical examples, they are no doubt correct. 
However, Stalinism was not communism. Nor is oli-
garchy egalitarianism. Nonetheless, critics of the left con-tinue to conflate authoritarianism for principles of class equality or dissolution. This is not a paean to communist thought. 
Rather, the question I am most interested in is why no 
one says the same of capitalism: theoretically good, bad in practice. The short answer is that the majority of stu-dents at UF were educated in our public school system, which is concerned more with socialization than educa-tion. 
Regardless, we saw banks collapse. We saw markets 
tumble. In other words, “Wall Street got drunk.” And capitalism, as a system and ideology, must be viewed as guilty and broken. Deregulation was the chant of the free-marketeers; deregulation is, in large part, the cause of our current woes.
The Bush tax cuts were a failed experiment in “trickle 
down” economics. The nonpartisan think tank, Tax Poli-cy Center, reported that between 2001 and 2008, the bot-tom 80 percent of tax filers received about 35 percent of the cuts. Meanwhile, the top 20 percent received about 65 percent; the top 1 percent alone claimed 38 percent. But the wealth did not reiterate in the form of job creation.  
Between March 2001 and December 2007, job and 
income growth was at its slowest rate since the end of World War II. A tax policy designed to spur growth in-stead curbs it. Laws that favor the wealthy at the expense of the nation (the cuts cost $2.6 trillion) should be re-pealed, especially when ineffective.
In 2009, the poverty rate was around 14 percent. Chil-
dren in poverty, a historically higher indicator, topped 20 percent. The rate of non-insurance was roughly 16 percent. Insofar as capitalism provides goods and services to all people, it fails for a 
portion of our society.
The 2007 poverty rate for Alachua County was 16.2 
percent. Furthermore, roughly 1,000 homeless people live in Alachua County, while there are only 350 beds between various shelters and transitional programs. The free market belief that charity alone can satisfy welfare needs is simply untrue. It seems to me that capitalism is broken because it produces a system that privileges profit over people.
It occurs to me, also, that capitalism is not broken. In 
fact, it is alive and well. For capitalism is working when the compensation of S&P 500 executives rises at a rate of 28 percent compared to the average worker’s increase of 1 percent over the same year. Unemployment remains stagnant. 
Capitalism is alive and well when Verizon workers 
suffer cuts to health benefits, pensions and sick days while the company makes $10 billion in profits. Capital-ism is alive and well when Verizon pays nothing in fed-eral income tax while enjoying a $10.3 billion dollar tax rebate for 2010.
And capitalism is alive and well when democracy and 
representation too become commodities. All things have a price. The Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court has only evinced this problem. 
Furthermore, democracy itself is under attack when 
interests, corporate or otherwise, disguise their agenda as independent and “grassroots” (see the Koch broth-ers, Americans for Prosperity, FreedomWorks and the tea party) while dealing strictly in ideology in a PR tech-nique known as astroturfing.
This is, indeed, capitalism. Ryan Fenton graduated from UF with a degree in English.

Humane Society supports UF’s Meatless 
Mondays
Congratulations to UF for participating in 
Meatless Monday (“Meatless Mondays are vital 
for creating a healthier campus,” Aug. 23). 
There are many compelling reasons to go meat-
free once a week. Some people support Meatless Monday because of the positive consequences for billions of animals raised for the dinner table.
On modern factory farms, animals are packed 
into warehouses, often with so little space they can’t even turn around. Most people would natu-rally choose more meat-free meals if they saw the fear and pain animals suffer in factory farms ev-ery day of their short lives. 
Reducing our meat consumption has environ-
mental benefits, too. The U.N. estimates the meat industry , along with the dairy and egg industries, generates a huge portion of man-made green-house gas emissions. 
Whether it’s to reduce your carbon footprint, 
improve your health, or to help prevent animal suffering, choosing meat-free meals one day a week is a win-win. Visit humanesociety.org/meatfree for easy vegetarian recipes and meal tips.

The Humane Society of the United StatesLetter to the Editor
In ancient Greece, an oracle was a 
person who could make predictions about the future. Nowadays, we have 
what you could call an oracle of investing just up the road from Lincoln. Warren Buffett, the “Oracle of Omaha,” is one of the most respected investors worldwide. It’s no surprise since he’s currently the third wealthiest person in the world.
So when Buffett wrote an op-ed col-
umn for The New York Times giving the government advice on reducing the debt and deficit, you’d think his ideas would at the very least be taken seriously. That wasn’t the case last week, though.
In his column, Buffett appeals to the 
government to raise taxes on him and other millionaires and billionaires, saying that, “While most Americans struggle to make ends meet, we mega-rich continue to get our extraordinary tax breaks.”
Buffett gives the exact number that he 
paid in income and payroll taxes last year: $6,938,744, or “17.4 percent of my tax-able income.” That, he says, is the lowest percentage paid by anyone in his office, whose taxes “ranged from 33 percent to 41 percent and averaged 36 percent.”
Fox News picked up this story and crucified Buffett for it. They im-mediately called Buffett out for 
“class warfare,” which is interesting be-cause he’s asking for higher taxes on his own class — maybe civil class warfare? He has even been called a socialist for his opinions. Because, of course, asking the mega-rich to pay a little extra is basi-cally the same as having a complete lack of private property and total government control of the economy.
Last December, when Bush’s tax cuts 
were about to expire, Democrats in Con-gress tried to extend only the cuts for the middle and lower class and allow tax rates on the wealthiest Americans to re-turn to their previous levels. Republicans thwarted this plan by threatening to let all of the tax cuts expire.
Raising taxes on Americans in the top 
two income brackets would raise $700 billion over ten years. According to Fox, that’s such a small number it’s not even worth it.
Fox’s alternative? Raise taxes on the 
middle and lower classes and cut spend-ing. They want the 51 percent of Ameri-cans who don’t pay any income tax to pitch in. As Jon Stewart pointed out last week, if you took half of the wealth of the bottom 51 percent of Americans, you’d come out with a little more than $700 bil-lion.
Apparently the folks at Fox News still 
think that millionaires are going to pass their wealth on to the rest of Americans. Unfortunately, there are some selfishly frugal upper class people who won’t buy a new car every month or hire someone to change the TV channel for them. Just look at Warren Buffett. He still lives in the same modest house he bought 50 years ago. How unpatriotic.
Now, I don’t have a problem with 
people who earn a lot of money by work-ing hard. In fact, I don’t have anything against people like Kim Kardashian, who get rich without doing anything. That’s just the way our society is.
What I have a problem with is people 
claiming that we can’t tax the rich for whatever reason while at the same time claiming that the lower class can afford to pay more in taxes.
Evan Marolf writes for the Daily Nebras-
kan at the University of Nebraska.

want to work everyday. I don’t have to.”
The truck made scheduled lunchtime visits 
around the city every week to locations such as the Northwest Industrial Park, Progress Corporate Park and Emerson Alumni Hall.  
With a regular menu of salads, sandwiches and 
flatbreads as well as daily specials including dishes like jerk chicken, crab cakes and meatloaf, the truck made occasional visits to other locations as well. However, Gollner said she had difficulty reaching one of the largest consumer groups in Gainesville, the student population, because of university regula-tions.
Aramark, the UF food service provider, has com-plete oversight of all eating establishments on the campus, resulting in a ban of outside food vendors. 
“Some of my clients work at the Sports Medicine 
Institute, and they asked me to come park there for lunch,” Gollner said. “I was there two Thursdays and UF called me and said, ‘Jules, you know you’re not al-lowed to park there.’ I said, ‘I know, I’ll go quietly.’”
Since then, the owner of the Chow Now Food 
Truck has steered clear of the college campus. 
Gollner said she gave the food truck business her 
best shot, but Gainesville is too small of a city to keep up with the trend. After months of setbacks, she de-cided she’d had enough.
“I am very glad I did it,” Gollner said. “She was a 
lot of fun to put together, and we had a lot of fun with her, but it’s not worth the effort. You have to know when to pull the plug.”8, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 31, 2011

S.C.O.P.E. Officer Marcus L. Brinson speaks with students in the Murphree Area. 
The initiative was started to help prevent crime by improving communication between UPD and UF students.
Four officers are to be available to assigned residential areas
to implement it in campus sorority housing 
as well.
Through S.C.O.P .E., four police officers are 
assigned to an on-campus housing area.  The officer usually is on duty during UPD’s two daytime and two nighttime shifts.
“The hope is that they [officers] will all 
stop by and develop a relationship or at least an awareness with the residents that it’s not so odd to see a police officer in the area,” said Lisa Diekow, director of housing for residence life and education at UF. 
S.C.O.P .E. was introduced to fraternities 
instead of sororities because of the volume of party-related events in fraternity housing areas, said police Capt. Bart Knowles, who manages the program.
S.C.O.P .E. officers are encouraged to make 
an effort to get to know housing staff and stu-dent residents, Knowles said. 
“At the beginning of the year, it’s real im-portant for us to try to have residents have an awareness about how to access the police department for their safety,” Diekow said. 
Officer Brad Roberts, for example, attend-
ed resident assistant meetings at Lakeside, told students about himself and gave them some safety tips for the start of the school year, Knowles said. 
Students also can contact S.C.O.P .E. of-
ficers by email. Officers’ email addresses are posted on bulletin boards in each housing area. The boards also include information on various programs offered by UPD, such as self-defense classes for women.  
S.C.O.P .E. is based on the idea of commu-
nity-oriented policing, Knowles said.
“The idea is to build relationships with the 
community that you serve … It’s an oppor -
tunity for us to just get our faces out there. We need to be approachable,” he said. “Our mission here is to provide the best environ-ment for a student to get the best education possible.”SCOPE , from page 1Season ticket sales 
increased this year
season tickets to sell each 
year. This year, about 23,000 students entered the ticket lottery. 
Gajda said the average is 
usually 27,000, but the num-ber has been closer to 30,000 in the past.
The average number of 
general season tickets sold each season is 65,000. He said this season’s number of sea-son ticket holders has slightly increased from last year’s.
Kelsey Leader, a first-year dance major, said she didn’t win the ticket lottery, but she likely will buy extra tickets for her mother, who is a UF alumna, and her stepfather. 
Leader said her mother is 
always on the hunt for cheap tickets to Gator games.
“That’s a good price,” she 
said. “My parents would pay that.”TICKETS , from page 1FOODTRUCK , from page 1Truck was unable to serve on cam pus

Sophomore Cody Riggs appeared in front 
of reporters Tuesday with a cast on his right 
hand, further jumbling an already unsettled situation in Florida’s secondary. 
Riggs said the cast was merely for pro-
tection after he sprained his thumb during a blocking drill in practice. 
He added the cast would be off by Sat-
urday’s game and he does not expect to be limited. 
Riggs was listed as a potential starter at 
cornerback according to coach Will Mus-champ’s depth chart that was released Mon-day. Junior Jeremy Brown is questionable for 
Saturday’s game against FAU after miss-ing more than two weeks of practice with a sprained knee. 
Senior Moses Jenkins is also in the mix, 
but Riggs said Tuesday that no one has claimed a starting position.
Muschamp said all 
of the cornerbacks are interchangeable, mean-ing a starting combina-
tion of Marcus Roberson and Jaylen Watkins is possible.
“It’s still up for grabs,” Riggs said. “We’re 
all just fighting for that job.”
The back end appears set with freshman 
De’Ante Saunders as the favorite at safety alongside sophomore Matt Elam, who has Notebook: Corner situation

only remaining option
What year is it?
No, no, no. Seriously . 
What year is it? If you have 
followed Florida football for the past 
month or so, be it through television or radio or this publication, you have heard plenty about 2010. 
While they haven’t lashed out dur -
ing interviews, players are clearly get-ting annoyed with the same old sto-ryline, and you can’t blame them. The questions grew stale two weeks ago, and they are still being trotted out each day by reporters, including myself. Sor -
ry guys.
But there are a couple reasons you 
keep hearing those questions about last season. 1) Last season was shockingly bad, and 2) You guys aren’t giving us much to work with.  
Some people say an 8-5 year isn’t 
that bad. Those people are wrong. Take away wins against Miami (Ohio), South Florida and Appalachian State because sixth-graders don’t deserve credit for beat-
ing up second-graders.
Linebacker Jelani Jenkins and corner -
back Cody Riggs see things differently. They said Tuesday that their record was deceiving because they lost so many tight games. They’re wrong.
Of those five losses, only two were 
close: a shocker in which punter Chas Henry missed a game-tying field goal with seconds left and a heartbreaker in which Les Miles went all “Les Miles” on

For 10 points in the second set, the Gators volleyball team 
was on the ropes as much as it has been since last Decem-
ber’s season-ending loss to Purdue.
No. 9 UF (3-0, 0-0 Southeastern Conference) defeated 
No. 25 Florida State (3-1, 0-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) on Tuesday night at the O’Connell Center, but it wasn’t as easy as the score might imply. 
In a rematch from the second-round of last year’s NCAA 
Tournament, UF was down  9-1 in the second set of a match it eventually swept 3-0 (25-21, 25-22, 25-22).  The deficit could easily be overlooked, but Gators coach Mary Wise said that should not be the case.
“We got some breaks that went our way, but it was pretty 
high-level volleyball,” she said. “No doubt we’ll have to see Florida State again.”
Senior Kelly Murphy led the way with a triple-double 
(12 kills, 17 assists and 10 digs) while the Gators hit .238 as a team.
“The main thing was just staying really focused and try-
ing not to get lost in all of the chaos that was happening out there,” Murphy said.
Murphy trailed only libero Taylor Unroe (15) in digs for 
the Gators, as the redshirt freshman continued to impress teammates and Wise in the backcourt.Gators sweep 
Seminoles thanks to Murphy, Unroe
UF Fo otballTHE JETT STREAM“Good things happen when Taylor’s touching the ball,” 
Wise said. “She has that ability to, in any rally, just get us 
back in system. She has an elite touch on the ball, both defen-sively and on passing.”
What was unusual about the in-state rivalry game was 
Florida’s slow starts in all three sets. The Gators trailed early in every frame largely due to some gutsy play by Seminoles redshirt freshman defensive specialist Katie Mosher, who re-corded a game-high 17 digs.
“The piece that was really impressive was how good their 
freshman libero was,” Wise said. “I think that an Unroe-Mosher battle would be pretty fun to watch for the next four years.”
Florida fought back from both its biggest and latest deficit 
of the young season in the second set and third set, respec-tively.
The Gators have yet to lose a set in 2011 after opening the 
season with three victories against ACC competition.
Etc: Tuesday night’s attendance was 4,631, including 1,901 
students — the highest count in UF volleyball history.
“Our students have been doing a really good job of show-
ing up,” Murphy said. “We’ve never had fans like this, espe-cially in the beginning of the season.”
The Gators will host Jacksonville and Florida Atlantic on 
Friday in the Campus USA Credit Union Invitational.been the most consistent through-
out fall camp.  
Despite the uncertainty over 
the starters at corner, Florida’s secondary should be littered with underclassmen Saturday. 
Increased role for lineback-
ers: After rarely rushing the 
passer last season, linebackers Jon Bostic and Jelani Jenkins said they have been preparing to blitz more under new defensive coor -
dinator Dan Quinn.
Bostic said Quinn has both of 
them working on their pad level when rushing.
“Jelani and I both, we kind of 
laugh because [blitzing] wasn’t really what we did a lot of [last year],” Bostic said. 
Under defensive coordinator 
Teryl Austin in 2010, the Gators ran more of a base 4-3 front with little other looks. 
But Quinn has brought variety 
to the defense, meaning Bostic and Jenkins must be able to drop into coverage as well as know which gap to hit in complex zone blitzes. 
“We have really the ability to 
do everything,” Bostic said. 
“We have the ability to rush 
the passer all day and bring the house. We have DBs that can sit back there and hold up. We really can do it all.”
Reed adjusting to tight end: 
Jordan Reed never played a po-sition other than quarterback until coming to Florida, and he said the toughest part of the shift is learning to be physical while blocking.
“I don’t think anyone likes 
blocking,” he said. “You’ve got to learn to love it, but I’m never going to like it.”
Reed said he envisions him-
self more in the mold of a pass-catching tight end, and offensive coordinator Charlie Weis said Reed has transitioned nicely into his new role. 
“When I came here and sat down with these guys to see where they saw themselves, I was waiting for him to say ‘I see my-self as the starting quarterback,’” Weis said. “He says, ‘I see myself as the starting tight end.’
“He’s really done a nice job. … 
I don’t think it will be hard to find him on the field. I think you’ll be able to find him pretty easily.”

Counting only fair competition (including 
Vanderbilt, if only because it’s in the confer -
ence), the Gators would have gone 5-5. 
But there I go talking about last season again. 
My bad. Really . It’s not fair. Here we are, just 
three days before the first game, and all we can  talk about is last season. Last season isn’t this season. This season is this season. 
And there are so many new things to talk 
about. Eight new coaches. New offense. New defense. But here’s the thing: It’s tough to talk about all this new stuff when you don’t actually see it.
Since Muschamp and Co. took the reins in 
January, only once has the team opened up its operations to the public: the spring game. And even then Muschamp said fans were getting a stripped-down version of what is to come, on both sides of the ball.
Translation: Trust me, dude, it’s going to be 
TOTALLY way more awesome next time. 
Muschamp’s statement actually made sense. 
The team suffered a lot of injuries before the scrimmage and didn’t have the personnel to flex any muscle. But the uninformative spring, coupled with the all-too-familiar team policy of closing every practice ever, gives media mem-bers less incentive to talk about all the change — you know, the things that are universally seen in a positive light.
Florida’s strict policy has actually hurt it-
self this month, because this preseason, unlike any other preseason in recent memory , is about atonement.
There are reasons to believe Florida can re-
deem itself. 
But if you value truth, you have to lean on 
what you have seen, not what people tell you. What is the last thing you have seen? A really disappointing 2010.
I’m excited for Saturday. I’m excited for foot-
ball to finally start. I’m excited for something different.
But, until then, let’s get back to last season: 
What was up with that, guys?

Charlie Weis came in with a plan when he became offensive 
coordinator on coach Will Muschamp’s staff. 
Although many of Florida’s players have said throughout the 
duration of fall practice that Weis is a very detail-oriented coach, 
the intricacies of the offense weren’t his biggest issue with his new team.
“Where some people are worrying about the finer points of 
the offense, I was more concerned with the foundation of the offense,” Weis said. “Once you establish the foundation … that now allows you to have a whole arsenal of things that you can 
do on game day.”
When Weis was being recruited by Muschamp and his staff, 
he didn’t know much about the Gators or their personnel from 
last season. 
After looking into the offensive players on Florida’s roster — 
from quarterback John Brantley, to the running back duo of Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey, to the cast of offensive linemen at his disposal — Weis ultimately accepted the challenge.
Upon arriving in Gainesville in early January, the former 
NFL offensive coordinator with four Super Bowl rings began implementing his pro-style offense and fitting it to the personnel available to him.
That began with Brantley, who Weis said is suited to run a 
dropback-style passing attack.
That passing offense is based on runs and play-action calls, so 
the foundation also stretched to the offensive linemen, many of whom were injured during the spring when Weis had to assess the candidates.
He also went through, player by player, and asked each how 
he saw himself in the new system.
When fans got an early look at Weis’ offense in the spring 
game, he said it was like a fire drill, with the offense being hast-ily thrown together. But in the months since, he has been im-pressed with the progress and work ethic the offensive players have shown.
Still, concerns remain for Weis heading into Saturday’s open-
er against FAU.
“You haven’t played yet and I think that anytime you’re put-
ting in a new system you really want to go and try to play as clean as you can in the first game,” he said. 
“There’s no preseason games here in college. This is kick it 
off and let’s go and it counts. You want to minimize your mental mistakes, you want to minimize your line of scrimmage penal-ties and you want to take care of the football.”
But with practices closed to the public, Weis’ offense in his 
first year as the Gators’ offensive coordinator largely remains a mystery to those outside of the program. And until the season opens, how well the offense comes together remains unknown to Weis.
“We’ll have a better answer for that about 10:30 Saturday 
(night),” Weis said. “I think practice is practice and games are games. There’s been plenty of progress, but you’re judged by what happens on Saturday night. You’re not judged by what happens in practice.”
