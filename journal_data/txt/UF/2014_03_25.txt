Laverne Cox, famous for her role in “Orange Is The New Black,” talks about her journey as a transgender woman to 
students at the University Auditorium on Monday evening. About 690 people attended the speech.

Laverne Cox encouraged Gators to em-
brace diversity during her Monday night 
speech in the University Auditorium.
Cox, a transgender advocate and ac-
tress on the hit Netﬂ  ix show “Orange Is the New Black,” spoke to a crowd of about 690 about her experiences as a black trans-gender woman.
The speaker, sponsored by Pride 
Awareness Month and Women’s History Month, was paid $60,000 to discuss the in-tersections of race, class and gender.
“I am not just one thing, and neither 
are you,” Cox said.
UF statistics sophomore Michael Capu-
to said the idea of intersectionality was the most important part of Cox’s speech.“A lot of times we don’t think about 
being multiple identities, but everyone is,” the 19-year-old said. “It speaks at a bunch of different levels. Sometimes we don’t re-ally think about it.”
Lindsay Abbott, a 19-year-old UF in-
ternational studies and Chinese freshman, said she waited in line for more than two hours to see Cox speak.

In the midst of an attempt to unionize, 
ﬁ  ve employees of Gainesville grocery store 
Citizens Co-op were laid off Monday.
Now, the co-op’s board of directors is con-
sidering shutting down shop in light of the disagreements between workers and man-agement.
“Events of recent weeks have brought us 
to the point where the Board of Directors had considered ending the operations of Citizens Co-op,” the board wrote in an email to the store’s members.
Emails dismissing the employees were 
sent at about 7:45 a.m., citing a breach of employment policies as the reason for their ﬁ  ring. The ﬁ  ve ﬁ  red were part of seven em-ployees seeking to establish a union to pro-tect their job security.
They used the store’s membership list to 
email materials about the drive to union-ize on March 11, an act that was considered “theft and misuse of company email data-base system,” according to the letters of dis-missal. Also cited was the refusal of the ﬁ  red employees to cooperate with an internal in-vestigation of the policy breach.Co-op fires

Hives may hold the cure for your allergic reactions. Bee-
hives, that is.
Adding local honey to your diet may alleviate allergies, 
some local beekeepers said, which is sweet news in the peak 
of pollen season.
They said it works similar to a vaccine. Ingesting the small 
amounts of pollen present in the honey helps the body get used to it and reduces the body’s reaction to its airborne counter-part.
But senior RN Stacy Rider, the allergy specialist for UF Stu-
dent Health Care Center, wrote in an email there is no scientiﬁ  c study that says honey helps with seasonal allergies. However, Ted Chapman, who works as a beekeeper at local 
beekeeping supplier Dadant and Sons Inc., supports the honey rumor.
“It’s true. You can take a teaspoon of honey every day or 
every night, and it’ll help you with your allergies if it’s a local honey,” Chapman said.
For the remedy to be effective, the honey must come from 
nearby, he said. Using local honey ensures that the bees are in contact with the same pollen spores that allergy sufferers en-counter in the air. Locals discuss whether honey has sweet effects on allergiesSEE LAVERNE, PAGE 4

� THE CWC HAS TWO DOGS: 
SIGMUND AND GABE.
ERIN FORD
Alligator Contributing Writer
As studying for finals looms, UF 
students are destressing with the 
helpful paw of workers at the Coun-seling & Wellness Center.
But these aren’t typical counsel-
ors: They’ve got wet noses and trot around on four legs.
Yappy Hour is a weekly work-
shop offered Fridays at the CWC that gives students the opportunity to cope with loneliness, sadness and homesickness and just make stu-dents happier — all in the presence of a certified therapy dog.
The center is home to two dogs: 
Sigmund, also known as Siggi, and Gabe.
“I’ve always thought that ani-
mals have had a special way of heal-ing humans,” said Barbara Welsch, a psychologist at the CWC and owner of Siggi, a 3-year-old Havanese.  
Yappy Hour began with just Sig-
gi last semester but has expanded to include meetings with Gabe, too.  Welsch said the workshop has 
succeeded in breaking through to students who have lost their pets or are missing them from afar. She recalled a day when three students grieving the loss of their pets and two who were missing their pets played with Siggi in the waiting room of the CWC.
“It was just really nice to gather all there. And cry together. And play with Siggi together. That was a nice session for them,” she said. 
 Caroline Dunn, a 27-year-old 
second-year UF nutritional sciences graduate student, wrote in an email  the program could be beneficial in other ways, too. 
“I think a program like this on 
campus is a wonderful outlet for stu-dents who may not be able to have a pet of their own to spend time with a dog and relax,” Dunn said.
Psychologist Jennifer Stuart, 
owner of Gabe, the 5-year-old shih tzu who parades around the CWC halls, said being around therapy dogs has proven effective.
“A lot of research supports that 
being around animals lowers blood pressure and perceptions of stress,” Stuart said.
The dogs’ presence also helps 
students become more social.
Though the dogs mainly work 
at the center, Welsch said there are plans in place to take Yappy Hour out on the road.
By taking the dogs to various lo-
cations with center staffers, Welsch said she hopes to hand out self-help information.

A UF fraternity is recovering after it expe-
rienced an outbreak of a “cruise ship” virus 
last week.
The norovirus spread through 22 mem-
bers of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, which led them to contact the Centers for Disease Con-trol to investigate the incident.
Paul Myers, administrator for the Alachua 
County Health Department, said the out-break is contained at the moment. Symptoms included vomiting, nausea and diarrhea. 
The health department obtained samples 
of the virus to confirm any suspicions, he said, but no further action was deemed nec-essary.“This is not a stomach bug that is an is-
sue,” Myers said. 
Diane Webb, a nurse at the Student Health 
Care Center and a specialist in infectious dis-eases, said the incident likely occurred after a shared meal at the fraternity house, which is why the health department had to be in-volved.
“The Alachua County Health Department 
is responsible for inspecting any facility on campus that prepares, handles and serves food,” she wrote in an email.However, because the incident occurred 
so soon after Spring Break, it could have also been a gastrointestinal illness brought back from vacation, she said.
Incidents like this do not happen often 
and are unpredictable, she said.
“This should not impact anyone else on 
campus unless they have close contact with someone who is sick,” she said. “Our goal is to keep our students healthy.”

Home remedies can be effective, risky
Exposure to an allergen in small doses to build 
immunity is referred to as immunotherapy.
“Allergy immunotherapy is often effective in reduc-
ing allergy symptoms,” Rider said. “However, it may 
take months for a noticeable improvement.”
Chapman said pollen is most abundant now, as lev-
els rise from January to about June. Spring, commonly known as allergy season, causes some people to try unconventional methods such as the honey remedy to stop their reactions to rampant pollen.
Chapman said he has heard of people being even 
more direct with their pollen consumption.
“Some people buy straight pollen from pollen pro-
ducers,” he added. “They sprinkle a little on their ce-real.”
However, he said this habit is a little scary because 
there are so many other possible allergens in the pol-len. If allergies are severe, eating a lot of it could be like playing Russian roulette, he said. 
Honey could even turn out to be dangerous.He brought up an example of one woman who 
bought honey to help a pollen allergy. She had an al-lergic reaction to the orange traces in the honey, which 
caused further medical problems.
Yaissy Solis, a 22-year-old UF journalism senior, 
said she was surrounded by allergy problems in her 
family, and they had their own home remedies.
“I’m Cuban, so in my family... you drink a mixture 
of honey and lime juice,” she said. “It works for me, so I wouldn’t be surprised if honey would (help aller-gies).”

American flags lined the 
sidewalk of the tan one-story 
house while U.S. Army vet-eran Jason Rodriguez and his family stood waiting for the keys.
Bank of America and the 
Military Warriors Support Foundation awarded Ro-driguez, 32, the Northwest Gainesville home mortgage-free.
Rodriguez’s wife, Brittany, 
said she’s excited to move in with her husband and two daughters.
“We really never expected 
to be recipients of such a great gift, and it just has been an honor,” the 25-year-old said.
Rodriguez served seven 
years in the U.S. Army as a sergeant and did two combat tours. He finished his time in 2007 and received the Purple Heart award, among others.
Military Warriors’ Na-
tional Home mentoring co-ordinator Sally Farrell said the organization provides financial and home mentor-ing for three years and then hands over the deed as long as the family maintains the residence and pays taxes on the house.
“At that point,” she said, 
“they’re established in the neighborhood and ready to go.”
Bank of America in North 
Central Florida senior vice president Jon M. Gardner presented the Rodriguez family’s house key and com-memorated their dedication to the country.
“I hold in my hand a key 
that I know unlocks the door to this home, but I believe — we believe — that it holds so much more than that and cer-tainly hope this key unlocks opportunity for you and your family,” he said.Army veteran gets new

Two board reps were dismissed
The fired employees, along with 
about 25 Gainesville residents, 
protested outside the co-op Monday afternoon with signs that read phrases like: “Co-operation not corporation” and, “Save the Co-op.”
One was Kelsey Naylor, who worked 
at the co-op for about eight months and was fired Monday. 
She said the board informed the 
employees they could be fired at any time for any reason during a member meeting in February.
Naylor said employees began to feel 
their jobs were at risk when two long-term workers were laid off for various reasons after the meeting, and the rest were told that the co-op was not a democracy by board of directors chair Lucian Kragiel.
“We were terrified,” Naylor said. “We didn’t want to say anything.”
Adding to the employees’ worries 
about the store’s management was the lack of worker representation on the board. 
A representative usually sits on the 
board, but the past two months have seen two of those representatives dismissed with no word of a replacement.
However, the board’s email said 
the two laid-off employees were offered other opportunities after their original positions were cut due to restructuring.
“Although it has been stated 
repeatedly that the board has fired workers, we have not done that, nor do we wish to be in that role,” the email read.
Sylvia Arnold, another of the fired 
employees, said the protests will continue until they get their jobs back.
“Hey, we have a lot of free time on 
our hands now,” she said.Honey , from page 1“This is not a stomach bug that is

Young Cox was bullied for being a ‘sissy’
24 hours, said she was interested in 
Cox’s social justice work and trans-gender advocacy, so it was worth waiting for even when it started to rain.
In her speech, Cox spoke about 
her childhood in Mobile, Ala. She said she dreamt about being a danc-er, but her mother would not let her because it was “too gay.”
Her experiences as a transgender 
woman led her to offer the audience advice — “calling a trans woman a man is an act of violence,” she said.
She also discussed gender po-
licing and being bullied for being a “sissy” because it did not fit with the typical male gender expression. However, Cox said that everyone is policed for his or her gender, not just LGBT individuals.
“What would it be like if each 
and every one of us decided we’re not going to be the gender police to-day?” Cox said. “And we’re going to allow people to be who they are and express themselves however they want to, and we’re not going to judge them.”Cox ended her 
speech by encour-aging audience members to have conversations with love to over-come difficult issues and un-derstand people better.
“I think that can be a journey 
for each and every one of us,” she said, “that all the preconceptions we might have about people who are different can melt away, and we can just get to know people as people.”

UF Kappa Kappa Gamma’s 
summer renovations, which of-
ficially began Sunday, might dis-place its Fall residents temporar-ily.
The $1.7 million renovation 
will add 5,000 square feet to the sorority house, including a dining room extension, designated chap-ter room, additional bathroom, second laundry room and six ad-ditional double bedrooms, said Danielle Chase, the active house board member for the sorority. 
Renovations began this week but are not expected to affect the women who live in the house this semester, she said. 
The house, which was previ-
ously renovated in 2006, will be able to house 52 women as op-posed to 40 when the work is com-plete.
The chapter is hoping construc-
tion will be done in time for Fall Recruitment Week, Chase said. Minor additions will be made the remainder of this semester. Most of the renovations will happen when the house is vacant this summer.
“We probably will (be able to 
recruit), but the rooms upstairs won’t be ready,” Chase said. She said the worst-case scenario is that 12 women will have to live in a ho-tel for a month.
The funds for the project came 
from contributions made by ev-ery active member, both past and present.
This is the third renovation 
the house will experience since its purchase by the Epsilon Phi chap-ter in the mid-1980s, said alumna and house board president Holly Vanture.
“Part of the reason for our 
growth is to allow us to keep up with the school’s growth,” she said. “We have over 200 mem-bers.”

Alachua County gained 
national recognition this week 
when the Clerk of the Court’s Ancient Records Project re-ceived the Florida State Ge-nealogical Society 2014 Pres-ervation Award.
In the last several years, 
the clerk’s office has been 
working to transcribe all of Alachua County’s old records to make them available online for free.
Alachua County Clerk of 
the Court and Comptroller J.K. Irby said his goal for the project is to make the records useful for people researching their family histories.
“I’d hate to go down there 
to the warehouse where we keep these old records and see a lot of things that would be important to families and peo-ple and know that they could never find them,” he said.  
Irby said the most impor-
tant thing the project has ac-complished is making the records searchable by name. He said he typed in his grand-father’s name and found his Alachua County marriage li-cense from 1919.“I didn’t even know he got 
married in Alachua County, and it’s that type of stuff that just makes it really powerful and really great,” he said.
That idea of connecting 
people with their ancestors feeds into his motivation to lead the project, he said. “We can do that for a family, and it makes it all worthwhile.”
FSGS award chair Kearby 
Parker said in most counties, researching family history would require a trip to the courthouse or hiring a certi-fied genealogist. She said she hopes the project will serve as an example to other counties.
“That really is the purpose 
of giving the award, which was not only to recognize those projects that are wor-thy, but also to spread the word about them so that other people might want to follow suit,” she said.County recognized

RESEARCH
AMANDA KASTRINOS

Something smells fishy under the sea, and 
it may lead to better bomb detection.
Researchers from the UF Whitney Labora-
tory for Marine Bioscience discovered special 
cells in the nasal senses of lobsters that can be used to improve technology that detects threatening odors.
UF Computational NeuroEngineering 
Laboratory director Jose Principe said these “electronic noses” are currently used to de-tect explosives or food contamination, but this breakthrough has the potential to radically im-prove their accuracy.
Principe said neurons in lobsters’ olfactory 
senses send out electronic pulses, or “bursts,” at a certain rhythm. Scientists from the Whit-ney Laboratory noticed these bursts were sent out almost like radar and responded when certain odors were presented.
Using a computer model, Principe and his 
colleagues proved lobsters can take advan-tage of these bursts and determine when and where the odor came from.“Remember that animals can be eaten or 
eat, right?” he said. “So you have to find out if you should move away or approach.”
Principe said the lobsters’ ability to respond 
is similar to when a dog is tracking a scent, but lobsters’ neurons are much more sensitive be-cause they can detect odors even in the rock-ing waves of the ocean.
“It is not easy to determine exactly the 
source of an odor in a turbulent environment,” he said.
Right now electronic noses can only give 
a general idea of an odor’s location, Principe said. But if the lobsters’ olfactory neurons are included in future designs, the device can pin-point the source with much greater accuracy.
“This has to be parts per million,” he said, 
“so if we can detect a minute amount, this is better for the industry.”
Sam Shays, a 22-year-old UF electrical en-
gineering senior, said he can see this break-through making a difference in other indus-tries like the medical field.
“The fact that they’re doing this type of re-
search and making this type of discovery right next to my classrooms is pretty cool,” he said.

MIAMI — David Beckham’s ar-
chitects and advisers have recom-
mended the Port of Miami as the stadium site for the Major League Soccer expansion team that will be owned by the former English na-tional team captain.The plan, announced Monday, 
proposed an open-air stadium with views of the bay and the downtown skyline. The capacity could be as low as 21,000 or as high as 35,000.
More than 30 sites were evaluat-
ed for the stadium. In addition to the recommended site, Marlins Park, Florida International University and a site near the city’s airport remain under consideration for the team.
There is no set year for the team 
to start play.
John Alschuler, chairman of the 
consulting firm HR&A, said the ear-liest the new stadium could be ready is 2018. If the team starts play earlier, it would have to play in a temporary home, such as Marlins Park or FIU.
Alschuler said a stadium at the 
Port of Miami would be built with-out the use of taxpayer money and that fans could drive there by using the Port of Miami tunnel and seek limited parking spaces.
Beckham’s group envisions per-

One would think with the recent press coverage 
that a lot of progress is being made in Holly-wood: Ellen DeGeneres served pizza at the 
Academy Awards, and Jennifer Lawrence got a pixie cut. It all looks pretty good from where I sit.
But in all seriousness, the latest Academy Awards 
was celebrated for its major milestones for people of color. Lupita Nyong’o became the sixth black actress to win Best Supporting Actress, Steve McQueen became the ﬁ  rst black British person to be nominated for Best Director and the ﬁ  rst black producer to win Best Pic-ture, and Cheryl Boone Isaacs is the ﬁ  rst African-Amer-ican president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Also, “Saturday Night Live” recognized in January that while white women can be funny, black women can be too, by adding its ﬁ  rst black female cast member in six years, Sasheer Zamata.
However, not everything is colorful in Hollywood. 
With the recent news that the white Rooney Mara has been cast to play the Native American role of Tiger Lily in Warner Bros.’ rendition of Peter Pan, “Pan,” it is clear that there is trouble in Neverland.
The decision to cast a non-Native American actress 
in a Native American role has sparked controversy, Twitter debates and an online petition asking Warner Bros. to “stop casting white actors to play people of col-or” that has received about 8,100 signatures as of press time.
However, some may view this backlash as all talk. 
U.S. News referred to it as an “obligatory Twitter freak-out.” And Warner Bros. may be of the same opinion that they can ride out this predicted and routine out-rage. The fact is, Warner Bros. will not risk supporting a no-name Native American actress when it can draw in audiences with a well-known face like Mara’s. When Warner Bros. can make $30 million in ticket sales on a movie, a petition signed by 8,000 people seems pretty insigniﬁ  cant. Though change may not be made before “Pan” makes theaters, the coverage of this topic is still important for the long-term reorganization of Hollywood.
According to the 2010 U.S. 
census, Native Americans make up about 2 percent of the popu-
lation, but according to a Screen Actors Guild report, only 0.3 percent of all TV and ﬁ  lm roles cast went to Native American actors in 2008. Also, according to a University of Southern California study, only 10.8 per-cent of speaking characters in the 500 top-grossing ﬁ  lms from 2007 to 2012 were black, 4.2 percent were Hispan-ic, and 5 percent were Asian. 
This leaves about three-quarters of all speaking char-
acters to white actors and actresses. So relatively, whites in Hollywood are more prevalent than water on Earth. Therefore, when a speciﬁ  cally Native American role is given to another white actor, it is disheartening.
Furthermore, we should stop pigeonholing Native 
Americans into primarily Western roles or stories that only exist in the past. No wonder there is not a huge pool of Native American actors to choose from. Why would they try to go into a ﬁ  eld where even the roles speciﬁ  cally made for them are given away? To engage more Native American actors, we need to promote their presence in modern-day roles.
I’m not upset about the casting of Tiger Lily to a 
“lily-white” actress because it doesn’t maintain the tra-ditional canon. 
Rather, I think we need to upset canons more often 
to present a more realistic representation of the popula-tion.

Medical marijuana 
could work in Florida
A proposed Florida constitutional amendment would al-
low for medical marijuana prescriptions for “certain medical conditions.” Supporters of the measure are pro-
posing stringent regulations on potential distributors to dispel naysayers’ fears.
The plan to adapt a better medical marijuana policy in Flor-
ida isn’t baseless; after all, we have California and Colorado — the “wild west of weed,” according to the Tampa Tribune — as models of systems that have failed. The rules and practices of the California weed industry have been evolving since 1996, the Tri-bune stated, allowing for easy access to the state’s ﬁ  nest kush. 
However, supporters of medical marijuana in Florida know 
they won’t gain momentum if they propose implementing the same loose system in Florida. Furthermore, the amendment campaign manager of United for Care, Ben Pollara, told the Tri-bune that Florida’s November ballot would include a “pretty strict set of rules” when it comes to the production and sale of medical marijuana in the state. 
Strict regulation proposals need to be on the table long be-
fore the amendment goes on the ballot, and organizations like United for Care recognize this. About 36 percent of Florida’s registered voters identify as Republicans, according to the 2010 U.S. Census. Democrats are still slightly in the lead, comprising 40 percent of Florida voters. Still, 36 percent is nothing to sniff at, especially since advocates for medical marijuana need to win over the conservative pockets of the state come election season. 
Unlike those implemented in California and Colorado, Flori-
da’s medical marijuana policy would be regulated from the get-go. This, advocates argue, is the crucial difference. Out west, the pot industries ran virtually unregulated when they ﬁ  rst began, and those in authority know that it’s much easier to loosen po-litical grip than it is to tighten. 
In addition, according to the Tribune, the amendment states 
that the Florida Department of Health would have 60 days from the bill’s effective date — Jan. 6, 2015 — to form policies govern-ing the issuing of medical marijuana ID cards to caregivers, the registration of treatment centers to dispense marijuana (includ-ing standards of security, record-keeping, inspection, labeling and testing) and the limits on how much marijuana a patient may obtain. 
The current political and economic climate seems favorable 
to the passage of a medical marijuana bill in Florida. The Tri-bune reported that a grower in Pembroke Park has made a se-rious inquiry about opening a marijuana-growing operation; a West Palm Beach publisher who used to work for a marijuana trade magazine is offering a seminar this weekend “for every-one who plans to participate in Florida’s future legal cannabis industry” to “meet the experts” on legal and medical aspects of legalized marijuana; and Medical Marijuana Tampa has mobi-lized quickly to educate citizens about the positive impact the bill could have. 
The signs, then, are clear: It’s high time — pun intended — 
that Florida adopt progressive, well-structured medical mari-juana policies.

I wasn’t sure how to reply to a 
question that sat in my inbox. 
It came from a high school 
senior who wrote about how scared she is by the descriptions of UF’s rape culture. She ended on a per-sonal note: As an incoming female freshman, would she also have a one-in-four chance of being sexually assaulted?  
As a male columnist, after go-
ing through hundreds of pages of documents — reports of criminal incidents, descriptions of internal-ized patriarchy in Greek life, sexual assault statistics — you start to feel desensitized. And then you pain-fully remember the obvious: For women, sexism is not some abstract issue. Being degraded on a daily ba-sis is the reality of many women on our campus.
The ﬁ  ght against sexism has been 
almost entirely led by women. There are countless women, nameless and faceless in the pages of history, who challenged the male supremacy of their eras. Even today, there are women, from the distant dunes of Saudi Arabia to the houses on Soror-ity Row so close to us, who are speak-ing out. They are marginalized, but who can deny their impact?
It is because of these women — 
not some mysterious group of chiv-alrous men — that I am able to write on sexism. By pushing sexism into mainstream discourse, these women allow folks like me to do our timid part. We are indebted to those wom-en who valiantly persevere on, de-spite being called “sassy-mouthed feminazis.” 
The question remains: What’s the 
role of men in this ﬁ  ght against sex-ism?
For me, it appears simple. It 
parallels the role whites had in the ﬁ  ght against racism. With privilege comes responsibility. Male privilege provides no exception to this moral principle. 
We all have a part to play in en-
suring that UF is not conducive to sexism. At the present, we have a rape culture, so we’re quite far from that goal. 
But let’s not sell ourselves short 
either.
The Fine Print reported that UF 
had one of the most “cutting-edge and innovative rape awareness pro-grams” in the 1980s. Our crown jew-el was a group called Campus Orga-nized Against Rape. In the landmark book about sexual assault on college campuses, “I Never Called It Rape,” the organization was recognized as “‘one of the nation’s most compre-hensive programs,’” according to the Fine Print.
Being “comprehensive,” COAR 
dug deep and went for the roots of the rape culture. With half of its members being male, COAR focused on how both males and females are “socialized about their sex roles,” i.e. men are expected to be sexually aggressive while submissiveness is the standard for women.  
Its founder told the Gainesville 
Sun in 1986, “We see males as abso-lutely crucial in helping to change attitudes that are put out by the culture. Women can’t do it by them-selves, (sic) males can’t do it by themselves — we need to work to-gether.”
As is with most good things in 
life, COAR died before its mission was fulﬁ  lled. In 1991, this highly ef-fective program was shut down, due to “a mess of differing politics, sepa-rate budgets and general bureaucra-cy,” according to the Fine Print. 
Today, the battalion against sex-
ism has too few soldiers. Reinforce-ments — student groups like COAR — are direly needed. 
Even if the seeds of our own in-
dividual efforts can only be reaped years later, we should start sowing so the next generation’s high school girls don’t feel nervous about com-ing to UF.

Sit down, dim the lights and put on some soft up-
beat music. We’re going to talk about porn.
Let’s start with the basics — those being that 
we are sexual organisms and therefore must have sex to re-produce. Unfortunately, we cannot simply sprout a child out of our bodies whenever we fancy. However, humans also have sex because it feels good, as do many other ani-mals. How do we know that animals have sex because it feels good? Well for starters, they masturbate. There are even studies that show por-cupines literally making dildos out of sticks. Note to female readers: Do not try that at home. 
So if sexual pleasure is so natural among other spe-
cies, what makes humans so special that we must shun it and slap a large sticker of rejection on its face? 
Pornography has been used since history could be 
recorded. Different people groups across the span of time have incorporated pornography into a daily con-cept. Let’s take the example of the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Images of pornography could be found as paintings on walls of brothels, as well as in-side drinking cups and homes. The ancient Greeks and Romans even worshipped a minor fertility deity named Priapus who, when depicted, had a giant penis hang-ing out. 
What we could refer to as Greek mile markers for 
travelers were stone slabs with the face of the god Hermes and a penis jutting out below. Penises were viewed as good luck charms to the Greeks and Romans. In fact, they viewed the naked male body as the epito-me of beauty. Another example is one of the most well-known erotic writings is the “Kama Sutra,” which was developed in India as early as 400 BCE. It was originally written so husbands and wives could both mentally and physically please each other to make the marriage strong.
Today, sexual obsession has made it into our televi-
sion shows and movies. Giving a movie a rating of R for strong sexual content or a TV show rating of MA for mature content warns viewers before the show be-gins. Popular shows such as “Game of Thrones,” “True Blood,” “Masters of Sex” and “Girls” all include incred-ibly graphic sexual scenes. I’ve become so numb to the sex and nudity in these shows that I sometimes forget I’m essentially watching a better-acted, better-produced adult ﬁ  lm. 
Pornography in the 21st century has evolved into a 
media giant. Nearly 12 percent of the websites on the In-ternet are pornographic. That’s a staggering 24,644,172 sites with 40 million American visitors. It has become a $2.84-billion industry per year in the U.S.
This begs the question: Why do we care if people 
watch porn or not? The answer: Our Puritanized soci-ety preaches that porn will corrupt, that sexual addic-tion is the stuff of sin and is destroying the culture of our people. 
Sexuality is seen as the deterioration of society. This 
is coming from the same society that says birth control and abortion are against the word of the Bible, but hav-ing that same child out of wedlock is OK. Granted, sex-uality should not be explored until one is mature and emotionally stable. Young men and women should not be slut-shamed based on their sexual interests. It’s not anyone’s business.
I believe there is a time and place for porn. Some 
people hate it, and some cannot live without it. Person-ally, I do not care. People have their own interests and desires, and so long as it is not hurting anyone, it should not give anyone the right to preach hellﬁ  re against it. If you care about adults who watch porn, just ask your-self, “Why do I care?” Most of the time, the answer will be, “Because I have nothing better to care about.”

Letter to the Editor
Bikes vs. cars
According the Florida Bicycle Law Enforcement Guide, 
bikes are vehicles, and bikers are drivers. “A cyclist has all 
the rights to the roadway applicable to any driver, except as to the special regulations regarding bicycles.”
Car and truck drivers MUST be looking for bikes when 
turning and pulling out of parking lots and driveways.
Let’s get rid of on-street parking on University Avenue 
and provide bike lanes in both directions from Waldo Road to Oaks Mall. Currently, bikes, pedestrians, parking meters, street lamps, trees, railings, chairs and newspaper boxes ﬁ  ght for six to eight feet of sidewalk width. This is a serious accident waiting to happen.
I hate nearly being “road pizza” every day and every 
night because many drivers just don’t look for bikes — just cars. They pull into bike and pedestrian crossing areas without expecting something to already be there. Everyone is always in a hurry. If you, as a vehicle driver, hit a biker or pedestrian and seriously injure or kill them, will you ever be in such a hurry again? Do you really want to go on in life with the knowledge that you did this because you did not look for us?
Residents and other property owners must clear their 
sidewalks of debris and overhanging tree branches, which is dangerous for us and a lawsuit just waiting to happen.
With 80,000 UF, Santa Fe and public school students and 
other bikers, Gainesville is loaded with bikes. We must be cognizant of the others’ presence and right to the same ter-ritory. It’s time we truly learn to slow down and co-exist for everyone’s safety.

I was disappointed to read the article in the Alligator on Monday telling undergraduates to stay out of the 
university’s law library. I believe the author’s opinion is only one of a mi-nority of the law school community. As a current UF law student, I want to offer a different perspective that I believe many of my fellow students at UF law embrace.
The author depicts UF undergradu-
ate students as loud, selﬁ  sh and messy. He blames droves of undergrads for ruining the library, which I think is quite an exaggeration. I’ve studied in the law library for two years now and have never had much of a problem. Sure, there have been students who have been loud or disrespectful, but it’s not an epidemic. Those people ex-ist in every library in the world. The solution is to politely ask the person to stop talking, not to shoot mean glares and attempt to bar students from studying there.
UF is an open campus. We don’t 
partition the UF law campus from the general Student Body, and un-dergraduates have the right to access our library. In a similar manner, UF law students are allowed access to just about everything undergraduates are offered.
It would be a shame if the under-
graduate Student Body attempted to keep law students off of the main campus. It’s great to be able to play in-tramural sports with the undergrads and have access to facilities like the numerous libraries, Southwest Recre-ation Center, the Reitz Union and the on-campus pools. Many law students cheer on the Gators sports teams or re-lax at Lake Wauburg. There’s even an independent, student-run newspaper where my colleague chose to voice his concerns.
Our law school community should 
avoid giving undergraduates the idea that UF law students, or lawyers in general, are elitist. The fact that you are a law student doesn’t put you above undergraduates or make your ﬁ  nals any more important. 
Also, I wouldn’t want to be in the 
business of telling Pat Young where he can and cannot study. Have you seen those biceps?
As a former UF undergraduate and 
current UF law student, I can say with conﬁ  dence that the Gator Nation is the greatest collective body of students in the world. I’d be happy to let future clients pore over Study Edge packets next to me. Go Gators. 
And undergrads: Welcome to the 
law library.

Speaking OutTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS
KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — 
After 17 days of desperation and 
doubt over the missing Malaysia Airlines jet, the country’s officials said an analysis of satellite data points to a “heartbreaking” con-clusion: Flight 370 met its end in the southern reaches of the Indian Ocean, and none of those aboard survived.
The somber announcement late 
Monday by Prime Minister Najib Razak left many more troubling questions unresolved about what went wrong aboard the Boeing 777 to take it so far off course.
It also unleashed a maelstrom of 
sorrow and anger among the fami-lies of the jet’s 239 passengers and crew.
A solemn Razak, clad in a black 
suit, read a brief statement about what he called an unparalleled study of the jet’s last-known signals to a satellite. The analysis showed that the missing plane, which took off from Kuala Lumpur for Beijing early March 8, veered “to a remote location, far from any possible land-ing sites.”
His carefully chosen words did 
not directly address the fate of those on board. But in a separate message, sent to some of their relatives just before he spoke, Malaysia Airlines officials said, “We have to assume beyond any reasonable doubt that MH370 has been lost and that none of those on board survived.”
Officials said they concluded 
that the flight had been lost in the deep waters west of Perth, Austra-lia, based on more thorough analy-sis of the brief signals the plane sent every hour to a satellite belonging to Inmarsat, a British company, even after other communication systems on the jetliner shut down.
The pings did not include any 
location information. But Inmarsat and British aviation officials used “a type of analysis never before used in an investigation of this sort” to zero in on the plane’s last position, as it reached the end of its fuel, Najib said.
Najib gave no indication of ex-
actly where in the Indian Ocean the plane was last heard, but searchers have sighted possible debris in an area about 1,240 miles southwest of Perth, and officials said more details would be released today.
Some of the relatives who gath-
ered to listen to Najib convulsed in grief at the news, with shrieks and uncontrolled sobs. Others collapsed into the arms of loved ones.
“My son! My son!” cried a wom-
an in a group of about 50 gathered at a hotel near Beijing’s airport before falling to her knees. Minutes later, medical teams carried one elderly man out of the conference room on a stretcher, his face covered by a jacket.
In Kuala Lumpur, screams came 
from inside the Hotel Bangi Putraja-ya, where some of the families have been given rooms.
Selamat Omar, father of a 29-year-
old aviation engineer aboard the flight, said in a telephone interview that he and other families were wait-ing for word about whether they would be flown to Australia, closer to where it is believed the plane went down.
“We accept the news of the trag-
edy. It is fate,” Selamat said.
After Najib’s announcement, 
some of the relatives of the 154 Chi-nese passengers went before camer-as to criticize the Malaysian officials who “have concealed, delayed and hid the truth” about what happened to the plane.
The search is now considered a 
race against time because the battery life of the “pinger” in the black boxes — the common name for the cockpit voice and data recorders normally attached to the fuselage — may run out in the next two weeks.
The search for the wreckage and 
the plane’s recorders could take years because the ocean is up to 23,000 feet deep.

The UF club golf team’s first tour-
nament was a hole in one.
The club, which began this semes-
ter, competed Sunday against schools 
such as Florida State University and University of Central Florida under the National Collegiate Club Golf As-sociation.
“There’s eight individual awards 
you can win, and we won five of them, and we won the overall award,” said Brandon Harrold, a 20-year-old UF mechanical and aerospace engineer-ing sophomore.
Harrold founded the club team 
with Laura Kanouse, his friend from high school, when they realized there was no venue at UF for them to pur-sue their shared passion for golf.
“Many tried before and failed, so 
Laura and I started it,” Harrold said.
Kanouse, a 20-year-old UF bio-
medical engineering sophomore, said she’s been competing in golf her whole life and thought UF needed a club team.
She said the competition this weekend went well, but her goal is to recruit more team members and com-pete in more tournaments.
“I was really proud of everyone 
that competed,” Kanouse said. “We won overall by nine shots.”
Jeremy Obordo, a 20-year-old UF 
pharmacy sophomore and member of the team, said this tournament was the club’s first chance to socialize as a team.
“We went out to dinner on the 
first night to get to know each other a little more,” Obordo said. “We get along really well.”
The club’s next tournament is the 
Ocala Nationals in April. If it wins that, the team will move on to the na-tional competition in New Jersey.
“We’re really excited, but we’re 
not trying to get too ahead of our-selves,” Obordo said. “We don’t know that we’re going to (win), but we’re confident that we are.”UF club golf team wins its

Young women are increasingly using medi-
cation designed to better focus and concentra-
tion.
Express Scripts, a pharmacy-benefit man-
agement company, recently conducted a study of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medi-cation prescriptions filled from 2008 to 2012. The March study found the use of ADHD medica-tion has increased by 35.5 percent nationwide; specifically, more women are using the drugs.
Child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist 
Dr. Elias Sarkis of Sarkis Family Psychiatry in Gainesville said there is a growing awareness of ADHD in women.
“In adulthood, as many women present 
for treatment for ADHD as men do,” said Sar-kis, who has been practicing psychiatry for 23 years.
But in childhood, one girl for every three 
boys requests treatment for the disorder, he said.    
One reason may be that young girls with 
ADHD don’t call attention to themselves be-cause they aren’t as disruptive, Sarkis said. 
Anthony Greene, a psychologist at the UF’s 
Counseling & Wellness Center, said there are two patterns of ADHD.
One pattern presents difficulty in focusing 
and maintaining concentration, and the other is seen in impulsivity and hyperactivity.
“Most of the students I interview suggest ADHD interferes with their functioning,” Greene said.
He said students can have difficulties rang-
ing from trouble holding casual conversations to zoning out in class. 
“They can have to restart and reread things, 
which can take them three to five times as long to get through study materials as their peers,” he said.
Caroline Davoli, a 23-year-old UF telecom-
munication senior, was diagnosed with ADHD two years ago. 
She said she loses her train of thought and 
forgets where she parks when she doesn’t take her medication. 
“When I got to college, things started catch-
ing up with me, and that’s when I was tested,” she said. “I was gifted in elementary and mid-dle school, so they never thought to test me.”More women using ADHD 
Facts from the
Express Scripts study
•Females ages 19 to 25 showed the 
highest use of ADHD drug treatments 
compared to women in other age groups.
•Increases in use of ADHD medication 
were greatest among 26- to 34-year-old women, up 84 percent from 2008 to 2012.
•In older age groups, more women than 
men are on ADHD treatments, and the gap widens as age increases.
•About two-thirds of adults were 
prescribed ADHD medication from their primary care physicians, rather than specialists.“I was really proud of 
everyone that competed. We

For students who are tired of 
frozen microwaveable meals every 
night and are hoping to channel their inner Bobby Flay, UF’s Culi-nary Arts Student Union is here.
CASU was ofﬁ  cially started in 
Spring 2013, but this is the club’s ﬁ  rst semester being funded by Stu-dent Government. 
This funding means all CASU 
events are free of charge for any UF student.
The club is open to all majors, 
and its members range in skill from beginners to advanced.“We really do appreciate any-
body. Don’t feel like you have to know anything about cooking,” said Camille Jamshidi, a 19-year-old UF Spanish sophomore and multime-dia director of CASU.
The organization will be holding 
a food festival April 2 on Turlington Plaza, where members will serve food to any student who stops by. 
CASU’s last cooking class of the 
semester will be held April 15 with a theme of modern cuisine. 
The cooking classes are held on 
campus at the Aquatic Food Pilot Plant and last less than two hours.“We want our members to keep 
coming and reward them by giving them priority when signing up for classes,” Jamshidi said.
Past classes included a Chinese 
New Year cooking class at the be-ginning of the semester where they made dumplings, fried milk and a Vietnamese salad.
Brandon Fung, a 19-year-old UF 
biology major, attended.
“Being a part of CASU helps me 
meet other people generally inter-ested in cooking,” he wrote in an email. 
Students like Alex Valdes, a 21-
year-old UF biochemistry junior, said he’d be interested in taking classes offered by the club.
“I’ve recently taken up cooking 
as a hobby, and these free classes would be much more fruitful for me than watching a YouTube video,” he said. Cooking club heats up with new funding
� CRIST IS CRITICIZED FOR HIS SUPPORT OF 
OBAMA’S HEALTH CARE OVERHAUL.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE — The re-election campaign of Flori-
da Gov. Rick Scott is launching yet another television ad, 
but this one takes direct aim at former Gov. Charlie Crist.
Scott’s campaign organization said Monday it will 
spend $2 million on a statewide ad buy that will go after Crist for his support of President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul. Recent polls have shown Scott trailing Crist in a head-to-head matchup.
This is now the second television ad launched by 
Scott’s campaign in March even though the election is about seven months away. Crist is just one of a handful of Democrats who is seeking the nomination.
Democrats and Crist’s own campaign responded 
quickly, saying the ad was misleading and was meant to distract voters from Scott’s record.
The ad features recent television footage of Crist saying 
the overhaul has “been great” for the state despite a dif-ﬁ  cult rollout. That is contrasted with recent stories about the health care overhaul.
“It may be great for his political career, but it isn’t great 
for the rest of us,” Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera said about the ad.
One of the stories highlighted in the ad is that 300,000 
health insurance policies issued by Florida Blue would be canceled because the policies were not sufﬁ  ciently com-prehensive under the health care overhaul.
But Paul Kluding, a spokesman for Florida Blue, said 
after the insurer sent out notices that most of the members have “kept their plans” with it since then.
Kluding said the Jacksonville-based insurance com-
pany also did special outreach that helped Florida Blue customers shift over to policies offered by a health care exchange because they would beneﬁ  t from new coverages and better premiums.
He added that because the enrollment period has not 
yet ended, the company does not know how many have “ofﬁ  cially dropped out of the system.”
Kevin Cate, a spokesman for Crist, said the ad was part 
of the “Rick Scott playbook.”
“When, after four years, you have no record and no vi-
sion, you spend millions attacking your opponent,” Cate said.
The ad is being paid for by Scott’s campaign organiza-
tion, Let’s Get to Work.New Gov. Scott ad 
rips into Crist
“We really do appreciate 
anybody. Don’t feel like you 
have to know anything about 
cooking.”

When Jabari Parker, Andrew 
Wiggins and Doug McDermott 
failed, the rest of their teammates suffered the consequences. Duke, Kansas and Creighton were all favored heavily in their NCAA Tournament matchups, but each one stumbled in the Round of 32 after their stars underperformed in the spotlight.
Yet when Will Yeguete scored 
one point on 0-of-5 shooting in the Southeastern Conference Cham-pionship, Florida still found a way atop the podium at the end of the contest. When Scottie Wil-bekin took just nine shots and two free throws against Albany in the Round of 64, the Gators escaped and avoided a disastrous upset. And when Michael Frazier II shot 3 of 13 from three-point range dur-ing UF’s first two games of the Big Dance, coach Billy Donovan still advanced to his fourth straight Sweet 16.
Each one of Florida’s players 
has struggled at some point dur-ing the season, but the key has been that the Gators never have to endure a night where the entire team struggles. Someone always manages to step up.
So if Frazier has a bad stretch, 
it’s not the end of the world for Donovan. Instead, the 18th-year coach has learned to adapt and rely on Frazier’s other skills be-sides shooting the basketball.
“I think Michael, after the 
game, even during the game, there probably was a level of frus-tration, wanting to be more in-volved, wanting to inject himself,” Donovan said about Frazier’s per-formance against Pitt. “But I think when a team makes a decision to guard us however they choose to guard us, there’s always going to be something open and something available, and to me the greatest sign of respect is when you try to eliminate or take away something from our team.”When Albany shut down Fra-
zier in the Round of 64 by limiting him to just four three-point shots, the sophomore guard still stayed true to his defensive skills and was effective against the Great Danes’ Peter Hooley.
And even when Frazier 
couldn’t capitalize after being given nine opportunities to sink a three against Pitt, he still was a factor with three rebounds and a steal.
Donovan compared Frazier 
to Joakim Noah during the 2007 national title game against Ohio State. More than anything, Dono-van needed Noah to guard the Buckeyes’ Greg Oden without any help to prevent their three-point shooters from getting open. 
Despite finishing the game with 
four fouls and just eight points on 1-of-3 shooting, Noah still found himself cutting down the nets for the second straight year. 
“Joakim Noah was a non-factor 
in the game, but he just played his role and did what he needed to do to help our team, and Mi-chael, based on however we’re being guarded, whatever is going on, just needs to play his role and take his shots when they’re there,” Donovan said. “He happened to get nine off against Pitt.  He didn’t get nearly as many off against Al-bany.  That’s going to happen. 
“But against Albany we shot 
51 percent from the field, so we were still scoring, and the offense I thought ran pretty well in terms of what we were getting and what we took advantage of.”
So when Patric Young sinks just 
3 of 11 shots against Pitt, Donovan can still count on his senior center to have one of his best defensive games of the year. When everyone else refuses to make the big shots, Scottie Wilbekin shoots a perfect 6 of 6 during the game’s final eight minutes and finishes with a game-high 21 points.
The Gators show weaknesses 
every game, but there are enough weapons in Donovan’s arsenal that there will always be some-one who steps up when the team needs it.
“I think in the game with the 
way Albany played us, [Finney-Smith], Patric, Kasey Hill, there was opportunities for those guys to be a little bit more aggressive offensively and do a little bit more offensively,” Donovan said. 
“The opportunities were not 
quite there for Scottie and for Frazier, and I think that’s what’s made our team good is we can have different players in different situations step up and score and do things offensively.”

The last time Florida made it to the NCAA Tourna-
ment, it fell in the second round to then-No. 1 Baylor. 
This season, the Gators have again advanced to the sec-
ond round and are set to face off against the regional host  
and No. 3 seed Nittany Lions in University Park, Penn., tonight at 7 p.m.
“I have great respect for (Penn State head coach) Co-
quese (Washington), a great coach, a great program with great players, especially senior-led,” coach Amanda But-ler said. 
“Inevitably there is going to be growth and improve-
ment and changes that make them a better unit through-out the year. 
“Playing in a fantastic league like the 
Big Ten, you’re going to find things out about yourself — good and bad — that help you become a better team. I think all those things have taken place with them.”
Penn State, the No. 14 team in the 
country and Big Ten champion, has a le-
thal combination of size and scoring that will be tough for Florida to contain. 
Senior guard Maggie Lucas is averaging a team-high 
21.5 points per contest on 39.8 percent shooting and a 36.7 percent clip from downtown. She also has made 94.7 per-cent of her attempts at the charity stripe this year.
Senior forward Ariel Edwards, who measures up at 
6-foot-3, is averaging 15.4 points and nearly six boards per game. 
“Something that we’ve known all year is that we’re 
smaller than everybody else,” redshirt sophomore Carlie Needles said. 
“We’re a team that likes to play in transition and that’s 
kind of a flaw for teams that are bigger — they can’t really play in transition as much as we do. 
“We’re going to try to use that to our advantage like 
we have been all year and try to force them to do things they’re not comfortable with. Sometimes playing someone Florida to face Penn State in second round of NCAA TournamentRachel Crosby / Alligator Staff

Age before beauty doesn’t re-
ally describe Florida’s lacrosse 
team, but that’s mainly because it has nothing to do with teams or even sports.
This season, No. 4 Florida (10-
2, 2-0 American Lacrosse Confer-ence) has faced some of its tough-est opponents in the country with its youngest team since UF’s in-augural class.
While it’s been noted many 
times that Florida’s age was a concern, the class of freshmen has proven that all the recruiting hype wasn’t just that.
After starting the season 
against No. 1 UNC and then go-ing against No. 3 Syracuse, No. 16 Loyola, now-No. 17 Stony Brook and most recently No. 20 Ohio State, Florida has shown what its 11 newest additions are truly made of.
With the team’s only losses 
coming against Syracuse and UNC, coach Amanda O’Leary said the tough mentality that the team has shown is what makes  its age irrelevant.
“We’ve asked a lot of them,” 
O’Leary said. 
“At one point against Dart-
mouth, we started five freshmen on that field. So we’re putting them out there and they’re re-sponding.”
Freshman starters like Taylor 
Bresnahan and Caroline Fitzger-ald have been the backbone of Florida’s defense this season. Both Bresnahan and Fitzgerald have defended against the two top offensive opponents for ev-ery team Florida has faced this season, O’Leary said.
Fitzgerald has caused more 
turnovers (13) than the rest of the defense combined (10). Bres-nahan has 12 draw controls, 11 caused turnovers and 11 ground balls.
While Bresnahan and Fitzger-ald control the defensive effort, freshmen Mollie Stevens and Sammi Burgess have made a huge impact on the Gators’ offense this season.
Burgess, who has started in 
every game this season, is the second-highest scoring player for the Gators with 21 goals and 11 assists, giving her a combined 32 points this season. She’s also grabbed 16 ground 
balls.
Stevens has also been an of-
fensive powerhouse. The Cen-treville, Md., freshman has 20 goals and one assist to give her a combined total of 21 points. 
However, Stevens is more than 
a scorer. Coming into the season, Stevens had mainly played at-tacker. 
With Florida short on mid-
fielders, O’Leary moved her to the midfield position.  
Despite the position change, Stevens has excelled — picking up 17 ground balls, causing four turnovers and taking four draw controls.
While Stevens, Burgess, 
Fitzgerald and Bresnahan have become important players, the other seven freshmen on the team are looking to get on the field more in the final five games of the regular season.
O’Leary also said she’s work-
ing to get the entire freshman class on the field and close out the season with minutes under each of their belts.
Against Dartmouth, O’Leary 
changed the lineup so that more freshmen would start against the Big Green. O’Leary said fans can look to seeing more of the fresh-men on the field in the coming games.
“We’re seeing a lot of help out 
there from our freshman class and that’s we need to do because obviously they’re the future to this team,” O’Leary said. “It’s fun to see them mature and get better each and every day and do what we need them to do in those games.”
The freshmen’s success has 
been a mild surprise to O’Leary. Replacing a large senior class is never easy — especially one as important as the Gators’ inaugu-ral class.
“Had you of asked me proba-
bly in the beginning of the year if we would be where we are right now, I would smile and probably say ‘Oh, sure,’ but still that doubt in my mind,” she said. 
“Having graduated 13 seniors, 
that’s a huge class to graduate and ones who had seen the ma-jority of the time.”

Two Florida golfers most likely 
slept pretty well Monday night, and 
two others, not so much.
After the first two rounds of the 
Valspar Invitational at The Floridian on Monday, UF is in 14th place out of the 15-team field with a 571 (+3) score through 36 holes. It is 16 strokes ahead of last-place Lamar on the par-71 course.
Although the Gators found success 
in the first round, shooting 281 collec-tively and cracking into the top five teams, they struggled in the second round by totaling 290 strokes.
No. 2 Oklahoma State and No. 4 
Georgia Tech both lead the field with scores of 554 (-14).
J.D. Tomlinson and Richard Done-
gan have each done their part for the Gators through the first day of the tournament. Both are ranked inside the top 10 on the player leaderboard with under-par scores.
Tomlinson is in a tie for fourth place 
after shooting 68 in the first round and 67 in the second round, bringing him to a 135 (-7).
“J.D had a good day, played some 
great golf,” coach Buddy Alexander said in a release. “That’s what we’ve been talking about — trying to play smarter and he did it.”
Donegan isn’t far behind, scoring a 
69 each in the first two rounds and to-taling 138 (-4). He is tied for 10th place, thanks to hitting 11 birdies.
“Richard Donegan had his best day 
as a Gator,” Alexander said. “I know he’s capable of a lot; he’s got a lot of horsepower and makes a lot of bird-ies. Today he cracked down, and it showed up on the scoreboard.”
But as good as Tomlinson and 
Donegan played Monday to help bring their team up, Ryan Orr and Conor Richardson brought the Gators down with their performances.
The duo rounded out the last two 
spots of the 75-man field through Rounds 1 and 2. Orr is tied for 73rd place after shooting rounds of 77 and 78, which brings him to a 155 total (+13). Richardson ended up dead last with rounds of 76 and 81. He shot 15 strokes over par.
Eric Banks’ day turned out to be 
a combination of how his four team-mates have done so far. 
The junior played well in the first 
round, shooting 68 (-4), but fell off pace 
in the second round. He shot 76 (+4), leading to a 144 two-round total and a two-way tie for 50th place.

alligatorSports.org.  Gators second to last after 36 holes in Valspar Invitational  While all this basketball 
madness has been go-ing on, the UF football 
team (Yes, it still exists!) started spring practice last week. I have the sunburn on the back of my neck to prove it.
  For those of you glued to your 
television screens watching peo-ple shoot round balls through hoops, I’ve been watching the football team practice with ob-long balls and do the same thing over and over again, and here’s what I’ve seen — when the Gators aren’t practicing on the far ﬁ  eld half a mile away from the crowd.Jeff Driskel will start: Re-
member this guy? He was the starting quarterback last year when UF football fans still had hope and Jameis Winston was still actually considering playing baseball as a career.
  Driskel led the Gators to their 
best season under coach Will Muschamp in 2012, but by the end of last year, he had been al-most forgotten — 10 games of Tyler Murphy and Skyler Morn-hinweg will do that.
  Well, rack your brain and try 
to remember, because barring an-other injury or other signiﬁ  cant change, Driskel is going to start under center — whoops, in the shotgun — in 2014.
  Driskel is by far the most ad-
vanced quarterback Florida has on its roster. He has looked good in early drills in the Gators’ ﬁ  rst few practices, and his right leg looks fully healed from the bro-ken ﬁ  bula he suffered against Tennessee last year.
  After the ﬁ  rst day of prac-
tice, Muschamp had nothing but praise for his redshirt ju-nior quarterback. He lauded his toughness — walking off the ﬁ  eld with a broken leg is no easy feat — and said Driskel has his team-mates’ and coaches’ respect. He had kind words about his arm strength and mobility, too.
  After a 4-8 season, Muschamp’s 
job is on the line. He isn’t going to stick with a quarterback purely out of formality. He’s going to go with whomever gives Florida the best chance to win.
  For better or worse, Driskel is 
that guy.
  Will Grier is not ready: On 
a related note, Grier is not the Gators’ savior at quarterback just yet.
  The four-star freshman out of 
Davidson, N.C., enrolled early at Florida to get a head start on his college career. He needs it.
  Grier deﬁ  nitely looks talented. 
The ball comes out of his hand easily, and he throws hard. But he has plenty to work on.
  He has occasionally looked 
slow in the pocket, holding onto the ball for too long. For ev-ery deep, accurate pass he has thrown, there has also been a wild one that’s too far in front or behind a receiver.
  As offensive coordinator Kurt 
Roper said to him during practice Saturday, “It ain’t damn David-son.”
  Jalen Tabor will be vital:
Florida could have had the deep-est, most talented secondary in the country this season.
  Instead, unsurprisingly, ju-
niors Loucheiz Purifoy and Mar-cus Roberson decided to forgo their ﬁ  nal seasons and enter the NFL Draft.
  It’s impossible to blame them 
for their decision — not entering the draft could have cost them millions of dollars in the pros.
  However, their departure 
leaves the Gators’ secondary a little green behind the ears.
  Instead of two extraordinarily 
talented and experienced corners leading the unit, sophomore Ver-non Hargreaves III is the project-ed top dog on the outside. Who-ever comes after that has a big role to ﬁ  ll.
  One of the top candidates to 
ﬁ  ll those shoes is early-enrolling freshman Jalen Tabor. 
  The ﬁ  ve-star corner ﬂ  ipped 
from Arizona to Florida in Janu-ary and enrolled in school shortly after. 
Tabor has appeared inconsis-
tent in the early going of spring football. He occasionally steps up to make a big play, but other times draws his coaches’ ire.
  The Gators got lucky last sea-
son. Hargreaves making an im-mediate impact in the secondary was a luxury. 
This season, Tabor carrying 
his weight looks like it will be a necessity.

Gators and Nittany Lions played in 
Bahamas but didn’t face each other
who is smaller than you is a little more uncomfortable 
than playing someone that is the same size as you.”
  Both the Gators and the Nittany Lions competed at 
this season’s Junkanoo Jam in the Bahamas in Novem-ber 2013.
  If Florida hadn’t lost in an upset to then-winless Il-
linois State, tonight’s game would have been the two sides’ second matchup.
  Although the two teams didn’t play each other, the 
Gators observed the Nittany Lions during its time in the Bahamas. 
  “We had the chance to see them in the Bahamas,” 
redshirt junior Kayla Lewis said. “It was good to see them again, but teams change a lot from November to March.
  “It’s good to see a team play, but it’s different to play 
against them, you get a feel for the emotional things and intangible things that you don’t get to see on ﬁ  lm, so it was good to see them play. 
“As far as comparable to the SEC, they have a lot of 
size like a lot of teams in the SEC have — big teams like Tennessee, LSU, South Carolina, which have those 6-3, 6-4 kids, multiples down low. We have seen it before.”
  The tough SEC schedule Florida endured will surely 
come in handy tonight against Penn State in a number of ways. 
  Penn State has the size of some elite SEC teams like 
Tennessee and South Carolina. However, because the game is being played in their arena, the atmosphere will surely be SEC-like as well. 
  “Deﬁ  nitely playing in the SEC and playing teams 
with great crowds like Kentucky, like Tennessee, like South Carolina that have a really big crowd deﬁ  nitely has prepared us for something like this,” Lewis said. 
  “As a team, we’ve overcome so much and seen so 
many challenges. Having a big crowd is something that we smile at (and say), ‘Let’s do it, what else ya got?’ That’s kind of the attitude our team has and has had all season, so we’re excited.” W-HOOPS , from page 13

Despite seeing his team drop its first regu-
lar-season series against a Southeastern Confer-
ence foe since 2012, Tim Walton doesn’t think his team is ready to panic.
“Well, we’re 30-4, so I think we’ve figured 
out how to win some games,” Walton said. “I don’t know if there’s a regrouping process. I think it’s just a matter of getting better.”
No. 1 Florida dropped two of its three games 
to No. 9 Alabama last weekend, and its perfor-mance at the plate was the key factor.
During the two losses, the Gators were lim-
ited to a .089 clip at the plate and went 0 for 11 with runners in scoring position. In their win on Saturday, they batted .333.
“We’ve got to improve quite a few different 
things,” Walton said. “We’ve got to get better at locating our pitches, No. 1. We’re going to have to get better with runners in scoring position, No. 2. We’ve got to get better at two-out hitting, No. 3. … Not everything bounces your way. You just have to improve on that stuff.”
Outside of junior Bailey Castro, who hit a 
grand slam during Florida’s 7-1 win on Sat-urday, no UF batter logged multiple RBIs throughout the series.
Castro, who finished 2 of 6 at the plate and 
drew three walks against the Crimson Tide, has made strides in her third year. Her .315 batting average exceeds her career high of .227 that she set in 2013. The Pembroke Pines native has 23 hits and 18 RBIs through 31 games.
Castro also has shown more composure at 
the plate, drawing 22 free passes and hit by pitches while striking out only 14 times on the season.

UF not worried after series loss
� MOURNING CONSIDERING UF, 
DUKE, GEORGETOWN.
TAYLOR WIDOM
Alligator Contributing Writer
Trey Mourning is ready to step out-
side of his father’s shadow. Whether or 
not that will require him to leave the state where his last name became leg-endary is still in question. 
Mourning, the son of former Miami 
Heat player, seven-time All-Star and two-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year Alonzo Mourning, will have to make a difficult decision. 
The 6-foot-9, 210-pound power for-
ward from Miami Ransom Everglades School has received offers from each of his top three schools: UF, Duke and Georgetown — his father’s alma mater.
Mourning, 17, said he narrowed 
down the list based on his desire to at-tend a university that would challenge him both on the court and in the class-room. 
During an official visit to UF on 
March 8, the Rivals.com 2014 three-star recruit took a campus tour to learn more about the school’s international business program. He also enjoyed a halibut dinner at coach Billy Donovan’s house — complete with ice cream pie prepared by Donovan’s wife, Christine — and spent time with the players and watched them beat Kentucky.
“I just want … to be with a group 
of guys who I’m going to grow with,” Mourning said. “(I want) to build a re-lationship like Florida has with those four seniors.”
Claude Grubair, Mourning’s coach 
of five years, said Mourning’s skill and IQ on the court set him apart from other athletes. 
“He has a very fast brain,” Grubair 
said. “He’s the kind of kid that only needs to see things once to understand and absorb them.”
Mourning said he hopes his future 
team will give him the chance to learn and improve on all areas of his game, including outside shooting — his strong suit.
“I’m coming in to work,” he said. 
“If you’re not getting better every sin-gle day, then you’re just wasting your time.”
Mourning plans to visit Georgetown 
this week and Duke shortly afterwards before deciding where to sign in early April.
Mourning said his father having at-
tended Georgetown has always been a factor in his decision-making process, but it’s not the only one. 
“I have great respect for George-
town University,” he said. “I wouldn’t have the life I have, and my family wouldn’t have the life they have, if my father wouldn’t have gone there. But at the end of the day, it’s my decision to make.”
Mourning said he will base his final 
decision on which program needs him and makes him feel most wanted.  
And when that time comes, the 
school that adds Mourning’s name to its roster will enjoy a player who brings a strong skillset to the court, Grubair said. 
“He is the antithesis of what a su-
perstar typically is,” he said. “He is not self-centered. He is a guy that loves to defer all the credit to the people around him.”Son of NBA great has
