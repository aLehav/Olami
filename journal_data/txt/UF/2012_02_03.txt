  The Florida Alliance for Student Action 
is holding Gov. Rick Scott to his pledge to oppose tuition hikes for Florida students.
  Scott announced this week that he 
would oppose raising tuition by 8 percent at Florida colleges and universities.
  “We see it as a victory for students across 
Florida,” said Cassia Laham, 22, statewide coordinator for FASA. “But you also have to take everything Rick Scott says with a grain of salt.”
  Scott’s refusal comes with the caveat 
that Florida’s focus should be on reducing costs.
  That means cutting programs and put-
ting more classes online, which is unaccept-able, Laham said. 
  During February, FASA, a network of 
Florida college and university students, will organize events on campuses across the state calling for the legislature to pass laws ensuring affordable, quality educa-tion. 
  The month-long campaign will culmi-
nate in a day of action on March 1, when all Florida FASA chapters will coordinate one action to send a clear message against what they call legislators’ attacks on education.
  Quality education must stay affordable 
in Florida, Laham said, which won’t hap-pen if the legislature still allows low tax rates for the wealthy.
“These people in the Capitol just don’t 
know how to budget money, obviously,”   she said.
  Student Body President Anthony Reyn-
olds said the key is ﬁ  nding a balance be-tween struggling students’ ﬁ  nances and the quality of education.
  Reynolds said Scott’s refusal to further 
burden students is a good sign. 
  “It means a lot to me that he’s aware 
of that, and that it’s an issue for him,” he said.  Scott’s tuition 
promise ﬁ  nds support

  The stretch of Interstate 75 that cuts 
through Paynes Prairie Preserve State 
Park   used to be a smooth, gray strip of as-phalt, a long carpet that rolled through the grass. 
One early Sunday morning, before the 
sun came up, smoke from a nearby brush-ﬁ  re crept onto a stretch of that highway obscuring the view of drivers passing through. Accidents ensued.
  Between mile markers 379 and 380, to-ward the south end of the prairie, 12 cars and seven semitrailers were involved in pileups that resulted in ﬁ  res on both sides of the interstate.
  The vehicles that caught ﬁ  re in the 
southbound lanes — two semitrailers and an SUV — left scars on the pavement.

  In some of the most difﬁ  cult moments following the deadly 
Interstate 75 crashes, family members publicly identiﬁ  ed the 
last unknown victims four days after their deaths.
  Michael Hughes and his wife, Lori, were in the front seats of a Dodge pickup truck heading south from Pensacola when the pickup slammed into a stopped semitrailer Sunday morn-ing, according to a Florida Highway Patrol release. Then a Ford SUV rear-ended the pickup, crushing the truck. Both vehicles caught ﬁ  re.
  The couple, and Michael’s 17-year-old daughter, Sabryna

� UF WILL MATCH THE 
GIFT TO FUND BRAIN TUMOR RESEARCH.
CLARE LENNON
Alligator Staff Writer
UF’s neurosurgery depart-
ment plans to use $20 million 
to research the causes of brain tumors.
A $10 million gift from the 
Wells Foundation, matched by another $10 million from UF, will bring a team of scientists to the university , said Dr. William Friedman, chairman of UF’s Department of Neurosurgery.
About 20,000 tumors origi-
nated in the brain are diag-nosed in the U.S. each year. Half of those are gliomas, which are much more difficult to treat and cure, he said. 
The scientists will research 
what causes brain tumors and how they form. Friedman said he hopes that will help doctors determine a cure.
He said UF’s neurosurgery 
department is in the country’s top 10 in patient volume, and it’s not a shortage of doctors that’s the problem.
“We need scientists,” he 
said.
Friedman said the team of 
scientists will mostly focus on glioma brain tumors. He de-scribed current treatment as “dismal.”  
The Wells Foundation gave 
$5 million in 2006 to establish the Preston A. Wells Jr. Center for Brain Tumor Therapy, ac-cording to a UF news release. This donation will create the Lillian S. Wells Fund for Brain Tumor Research.UF receives $10M for

Students planning to graduate at 
the end of the spring semester must 
apply for a degree by today.
The Office of the University Reg-
istrar’s website does not indicate a deadline time.
Applicants can log onto isis.ufl.
edu and select “Degree Application” on the left side under “My Record.”
Students can only apply for one 
degree at a time, according to the site. Those who plan to graduate with multiple degrees will have the option to return to the page to sub-mit additional degrees.
The page asks applicants to type 
their names  exactly as they want it to appear on their diplomas, includ-ing letters with accents and special characters.
Students can choose whether 
they want to be listed in the com-mencement program and enter their degree request information.
Responses to all three sections are required. After the application is submitted, a confirmation page should appear.
Students who miss the deadline 
can petition to apply late through the registrar’s website. Students must submit the forms to their col-lege’s dean’s office for approval. 
The first deadline for ordering a 
cap and gown is March 2. Graduat-ing students can also purchase hon-ors cords, and students with certain degrees rent hoods with their caps and gowns.Degree applications due today

Eligible UF faculty members will receive a 3 per-
cent raise beginning with their first paychecks in 
March, but not without conditions.
In exchange for the raise, faculty members will sac-
rifice some of their leave benefits.
Upon leaving UF, the maximum payout for unused 
vacation leave is now 200 hours. Maximum vacation leave accrual for faculty at year’s end was reduced from 480 hours to 352 hours.
Payment for unused sick leave will be eliminated, 
except for eligible faculty who retire on or before June 30, 2016.  
Paula Fussell, vice president of Human Resource 
Services, said faculty members are generally happy  with the raise, which was initially proposed in June. It balances a state law passed last year requiring state employees to contribute to their own retirement funds. 
“It depends on which faculty you 
talk to, but overall I think the faculty receiving the 3 percent payment are pleased and understand the trade-off for the leave changes,” Fussell said.
United Faculty of Florida has not 
yet agreed to the proposal, exclud-ing faculty union members from the raise. 
UFF members are also not affected by the vacation 
and sick-leave changes, which become effective for non-UFF faculty members on Feb. 17.Faculty to receive 3 percent raise

The asphalt running through the prairie is no longer that rolled-out carpet.
Twenty feet of asphalt just 
past mile-marker 379 is discol-ored and disfigured from the fires.
A black shadow lurks over 
the middle and right lanes. The burned black pavement is spot-ted with four mounds of gritty asphalt, each about as wide as a beach ball and as tall as a speed bump.
When cars speed over the 
bumps and the 20 feet of tar -
nished road, tires grumble.
The Florida Department of 
Transportation will repave the two burned southbound lanes, most likely within the next month, FDOT spokeswoman Gina Busscher said.
Most of the damage is only 
in southbound lanes, Busscher said. There are little cuts in the pavement going northbound to be repaired near mile-marker 380. Despite this, she was reas-suring.
“Drivers should not be hesi-
tant,” she said. “There is no danger here.”
Until the inspectors at FDOT 
determine the extent of the road damage, Busscher said, the cost of the repairs will be unknown.

until two days later, the teenager’s 
mother, Celeste Knapp, told the Pensacola News Journal on Thurs-day.
After the crash, which was 
caused by thick smoke and fog early Sunday morning, a tow truck carried the Hugheses’ pickup to the forensics compound in the back of the Alachua County Sheriff’s Of-fice.   
“[The pickup] looked like an ac-
cordion,” said Larry Bedore, direc-tor of investigations for the District 8 Medical Examiner.
Gainesville Fire Rescue peeled 
back layers of twisted metal before removing the pickup’s roof and front seats. On Tuesday, medical examiners discovered Sabryna, in-creasing the death toll of the crash-es to 11.
FHP did not confirm the identi-
ties of the three victims in the truck Thursday, but authorities told Knapp on Tuesday they found the remains of her daughter, according to the News Journal. Messages sent to Sabryna’s family members were not returned Thursday night.
Michael, Lori and Sabryna were 
traveling to Sarasota on Sunday to attend Lori’s father’s funeral.More than a dozen people 
worked on the truck this week, including medical examiners, fo-rensics specialists, detectives and crime scene investigators, Bedore said. An anthropology team from UF was also involved.
Led by Katie Skorpinski and Tra-
ci Van Deest, six or seven students helped, said Dr. Michael Warren, director of the C.A. Pound Human Identification Laboratory. The lab, located in the Shands at UF Cancer Center, analyzes skeletal remains for the medical examiner’s office.
The investigators spent the 
week combing through the inside of the truck with brushes, looking for charred bones and teeth.
Friends and family members 
will hold a candlelight vigil in Sa-bryna’s honor tonight at Avondale Park in Pensacola at 5:30.
“My daughter and my best 
friend left this temporary world as a victim of the deadly I-75 crash in Gainesville,” Knapp wrote on her Facebook wall Wednesday morn-ing. “This is an incredibly hard disposition for me.... She impacted and touched lots of lives.”
A memorial service will be held 
for Sabryna at Jubilee International Ministries at 5910 North W St. in Pensacola on Sunday at 3 p.m.4, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 2012

Cutting aid to colleges that do not 
keep tuition low and doubling the cur -
rent number of available work-study 
jobs are highlights of the Obama ad-ministration’s blueprint for keeping higher education affordable.
Vice President Joe Biden and Sec-
retary of Education Arne Duncan dis-cussed the blueprint with college jour -
nalists during a press conference call Thursday. The plan details proposed measures to increase financial aid and limit tuition increases.
While state governments handle 
public university funding and individ-ual universities determine how to allo-cate their budgets, the federal govern-ment has the power to provide student financial aid.
Vice President Joe Biden said the 
president plans to put several pro-grams into place in the coming year.
The administration plans to aid col-
leges that initiate programs that keep college affordable and reduce  aid to colleges that do not keep tuition low.
The college’s affordability will be 
based on the net tuition, which is what a student pays on average after consid-ering scholarships and loans.
The administration also plans to ex-
pand existing feder -
al student financial aid programs.
Biden said the 
government cur -
rently pays $980 mil-lion to fund 710,000 student work-study jobs. He said the president plans to 
double the number of work-study jobs available.
The president’s goal is to make the 
U.S. the country with the highest per -
cent of college graduates, Biden said. The U.S. is currently No. 17 on that list.
“Any country that out-educates 
us is going to out-compete us,” Biden said.Biden touts tuition planBENJAMIN S. BRASCH

Three local politicians raised tens of thou-
sands of dollars to spend on advertising, mailing 
and websites for their campaigns.
The newly elected District 1 Commissioner, 
Yvonne Hinson-Rawls, and the at-large 1 runoff candidates, Lauren Poe and Nathan Skop, raised about $53,000 collectively.
“If you talk to anybody who runs for office, 
they will tell you their least favorite part is rais-ing money,” Poe said. “It’s tough.”
Poe raised $19,479.52 for his campaign.He used WWD Strategies Inc., a political cam-
paign consulting firm, started by UF political campaigning graduate students.
The firm managed Poe’s volunteers and the 
logistics of his campaign, he said. Poe  paid the firm $5,636.44.
He spent a total of $17,448.99 on his cam-
paign.
“If you are people-rich and money-poor, then 
you go door-to-door and call your voters,” Poe said. 
Skop used a different tactic to get into the run-
off: TV advertisements.
Skop paid about $16,000 for Ozean Media Inc., a Gainesville advertising agency, to create a 30-second TV ad detailing how he would con-tinue the fight to protect people.
He also spent about $3,100 on direct mailing 
to spread his message. 
He spent $120.24 on postage.On Jan. 23, Skop spent $50 on catering for a 
campaign fundraiser at Leonardo’s 706.
He raised $21,635 and spent $19,991.62 over -
all.
Skop could not be reached for comment.Other candidates spread their views in other 
ways.
Hinson-Rawls, who spent a total of $7,672.20, 
spent about $500 for radio advertisements to air on WXJZ-FM Smooth Jazz and Praize 107.5.
She said the key to a successful campaign is 
successful fundraising. She raised $11,461.33.
“Not everyone is going to say ‘yes,’” Hinson-
Rawls said. “And some people are going to say more than ‘no.’”Candidates raise about $53K

for office, they will tell you their least

Super Bowl Sunday. 
Let’s go through the checklist. Hotdogs? Check. Chips? 
Check. Adult Beverages? Check. Foam Fingers? Why not? 
Face paint? Too far, man. 
Only one thing is missing before we can move into Su-
per Bowl weekend. That’s why it’s time for this week’s if-you-bring-anything-with-the-phrase-”hard”-in-it-you’re-uninvited edition of...
Darts & Laurels
To kick it off, for thinking that anyone cares, we toss a 
you’re-not-that-damn-important DART to Donald Trump, 
who kept the press on the edge of its seat yesterday as it awaited the announcement of whom he would endorse for president. 
Guess what? It doesn’t matter one bit.Next up, in honor of the weekend, we give a perfect-
excuse-to-drink-and-eat-like-crap LAUREL to Super Bowl 
parties. 
Whether or not you care who’s playing or even if you 
dislike football, who can be against an excuse to party? 
For being completely disgusting and kind of creepy, we 
give a think-of-the-worst-disease-ever-then-multiply-by-100 DART to USA300, a flesh-eating super-bug spreading 
across Britain that apparently can spread by sneezing. 
It also causes boils and eats away at lung tissue. Great! For “perpetrating” a great prank, we give a be-careful-
who-you-give-creative-license-to LAUREL to the inmate 
from Vermont who, when tasked with designing decals for police cruisers, implanted the shape of a pig on the state seal. 
If you look closely at the seal, which is part of the decal 
on police cruisers, you can see that one of the cow’s spots is shaped like a pig. 
Brilliant. For lacking restraint and reasoning skills, we throw a 
police-need-to-chill-the-eff-out DART to Calumet City po-
lice officers in Illinois, who shot and killed a 15-year-old boy with Asperger’s syndrome, a mild form of autism. 
The officers said that the boy was threatening them with 
a “kitchen knife,” but his family said he was holding a but-ter knife. 
What a disgrace! Finally, we give a thank-you-for-showing-some-hu-
manity LAUREL to U.S. Immigration and Customs En-
forcement for not deporting Lidiane Carmo, a victim of the Interstate 75 crash last weekend, who lost her entire fam-ily. Carmo, 15, and her family were living in the U.S. on expired work visas. 
Have a fun and safe weekend, and be sure to check back 
next week! 14th Amendment wrongly interpreted
Not only does immigration keep our national demo-
graphics from stagnating, but it also adds to the fiber of America because we are a nation of immi-
grants. Almost every one of our family histories includes an immigrant, yet we come together with shared values and have built the most prosperous country in the world. 
Personally, I do not have a problem with immigration.  I 
think we should welcome everyone. But one phenomenon has always bothered me: “anchor babies.”Children born on American soil gain birthright citizenship. “Anchor babies” refers to children of illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. to give birth solely to increase their chances of becoming le-gal residents because of their child’s citizenship status. The idea of birthright citizenship should be revoked because it is unconstitutional and not economical.
Many point to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Con-
stitution as the basis for birthright citizenship. It states, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States…” The purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to grant citizenship to recently freed slaves after the Civil War, not to provide blanket birthright citizenship. Many people simply disregard the “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” portion of the amendment as old English. But it, like every other word and phrase in the Constitution, serves a purpose. According to Sen. Howard in 1866, the Fourteenth Amendment applies to all people born in the U.S., except foreigners, aliens and families of ambassadors or foreign ministers. 
Sen. Trumbull, the writer of the Thirteenth Amendment, 
also commented on the “subject to the jurisdiction thereof,” line, defining it as “not owing allegiance to anyone else.” This means having no allegiance to foreign countries. The interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment has been mis-construed to mean birthright citizenship, so much so that there have been a few recent Congressional movements to officially define its interpretation.
The cost of “anchor babies” is increasing because the number of these children is on the rise. According to a 2009 Pew Research Center report, 73 per -
cent of children born to illegal immigrants were born in the U.S. and were thus granted birthright citizenship. According to that same report, almost 7 percent of children in kindergarten through 12th-grade public education had 
one parent who was an illegal immigrant. 
Illegal aliens usually have their children in the emergency 
room because, by federal mandate, the E.R. must take and treat all patients, regardless of ability to pay. According to a 2007 Accuracy in Media special report, birthing babies to ille-gal immigrants in emergency rooms around the country costs taxpayers between $3 billion and $6 billion a year. Because of their economic situations, mothers of “anchor babies” are usually eligible for WIC assistance from the federal govern-ment. Illegal immigrants do not pay federal income taxes. So who foots the bill for the cost to birth, feed and school “an-chor babies”? The answer is the American taxpayer. Clearly , birthright citizenship has encouraged people to come here illegally, have their children and live off our country’s gener -
ous social safety net, putting a burden on the economy . 
It really is a shame that immigration has become such a 
heated topic that people can’t talk about it without shouting or getting out of their seats. I do sympathize with the people who look to America as a place for better lives for their chil-dren, but there has to be some sense of order to the immigra-tion process. 
“Anchor babies” hurt the U.S. economy and undermine 
the Constitution. We ought to have a second look at the Four -
teenth Amendment and remove the incentive of birthright citizenship.

ing Luke Bailey’s column “Rituals still have value in the age of reason” referencing the “Writing on the Wall” exhibit, I felt compelled to refute some of his statements. 
Bailey states, “Sure, there are some backward holdovers 
— the right-wing fundamentalists, the street preachers and the Luddites — but they represent a small niche on campus, and we all attend class in an environment where Robespi-erre would feel right at home.”
What was the author’s purpose in making a statement 
like that, even when discussing a worthy expression of campus unity? Is the author somehow now the anointed arbiter of “reason” to the extent that he feels comfortable framing his arguments in such a publicly condescending manner? 
What about left-wing fundamentalists? Are they some-
how more reasonable? Occupiers — are they somehow more sincere than street preachers? Militant atheists — do they speak for the majority? All are ideological minorities to be sure, but probably far too fashionable to draw the Anointed Elite’s ire as less than “reasonable,” I suspect. 
As to the comment concerning a classroom environment 
which would make Robespierre feel at home, I found this both profoundly ludicrous and rather instructive as to the author’s worldview in making such extravagantly prepos-terous statements. 
If a sophisticated Frenchman needed to illustrate the 
learning environment we enjoy here at UF, I would think one might select someone like Louis Pasteur, Jules Verne or Alexis de Tocqueville rather than a butcher like Robe-spierre, who read a little Rousseau at school, argued against the death penalty and declared himself a “moderate” in his famous phrase  “ni monarchiste ni républicain” 
(neither monarchist nor republican). He later decided to become the arbiter of “reason” by bathing in the blood of thousands of his countrymen during the Reign of Terror. I don’t know how things are done in the author’s history de-partment, but they luckily aren’t nearly that “reasonable” anywhere else that I can see. 
Later, Bailey goes on to say, “We no longer light incense 
or pray to the Virgin Mary — we’re much too clever for that.”
Au contraire. Just across University Avenue is a rather 
large Catholic church and student center — St. Augustine’s. We’ve all noticed it. There are also Jewish, Lutheran, Islam-ic and Protestant houses of worship along the same street. But according to the author, presumably only the Great Un-washed still believe in such “quaint and illogical” beliefs. To this I would counter that my fellow students, probably in a significant majority, adhere to diverse religious prac-tices which, though the “elite” among us may not approve of them, are neither unreasonable nor illogical. 
The only illogical thing here is the ill-conceived pontifi-
cation of the self-anointed “guardians of reason” who find their beliefs preferable to those of everyone else, using dis-missive narratives to buttress their own vain assumptions. This is a capital mistake. Be they Catholic or Protestant, Muslim or Jewish, agnostic or devout, rest assured that they all prefer their views to those of others; otherwise they wouldn’t hold them. The major difference is, they don’t take to the presses to 
smugly condescend to everyone else around them for not being as brilliant as they. 
I found it ironic that Abdul Zalikha’s article on the op-
posing page from Bailey’s was about not being dismissive of the thoughts of others, even when they may appear po-tentially disagreeable, as in the case of 9/11 “Truthers.” Be-cause he is a history major, I know that a valuable lesson the author might take away from his training is the danger of dismissing ideas, particularly when, historically, the loudest mockers often end up being the ones dismissed themselves over the course of time. The rights to self-determination, es-pecially religious liberty, and the struggle to attain and re-tain the same is a basic tenet of all mankind, no matter one’s nationality. But only in America is such a rich inheritance the birthright of every one of us to jealously guard against all trespasses — no matter how “unreasonable” this may seem to those who think they must know better than we.
I would respectfully suggest that some still have a great 
deal to learn about a great deal of things. My hope is that they are taught as quickly as possible because the responsi-bility for defending personal liberty against those who pur -
port to know “better” than we how to live, think and pray, and who are invariably only acting for “our own good,” has already fallen to each and every young American. Beware, the smug Anointed Elite, wherever you find them, because for each one of these you depose, there will always be an-other coming along to take its place, possibly even from the history department.

Speaking Out
Last week, Google announced its new 
privacy policy, which will take effect March 1.
The policy strives for simplicity in both 
length and language, and it unifies nearly all of Google’s services, products and websites. The notable changes in the policy focus on the merges and the ways this will affect ad-vertising and the overall privacy of Google’s users.
While Google reasons that having one 
privacy policy mutually benefits both users and advertisers, there are privacy advocates who are alarmed by the changes. Jeffery Chester, executive director at The Center for Digital Democracy, told NPR that “on-line advertisers want to be assured that they can access users online, knowing everything possible about them,” which Google’s pri-vacy changes would provide.
Despite these baseless concerns, Google’s 
senior vice president, Alan Eustace, told NPR that collecting data from multiple Google services will give users innovative experiences. For example, by combining in-formation gathered from the calendar feature and data from map and traffic applications, Google can determine what time a user can leave his or her house so he or she can ar-rive at a scheduled meeting in San Francisco without worrying about road congestion.
The changes made to Google’s privacy 
policy would likely not affect the lives of ev-eryday citizens and the new policy pledges to request consent for further changes. If us-ers are still not convinced that the changes are harmless, there are options.
One option is to 
disable cookies on 
your Internet browser because cookies play a significant role in how Google is able to track you across its services. In addition, one can choose not to use Google. Because of the innovative and competitive Internet environment, there are other search engines, email accounts, social networking sites and service options other than Google, including Hotmail and Bing.
At the very least, Google is giving users 
enough time to adjust should they decide to close their Gmail or YouTube accounts. 
Ultimately, privacy groups can repri-
mand these policy changes, but few people seem to care about how their data is used, as shown by the popularity of Facebook.
There is no doubt that Google is preva-
lent and this privacy policy change reflects a changing Internet culture. The Internet and all the technological devices that access it can be easily valued as a human right. 
In fact, last June the United Nations pub-
lished a report declaring Internet access a fundamental human right.
Viewing the Internet in this sense allows 
us to easily forget that there are real compa-nies seeking revenue that can justify giving advertisers user data because this business model has gone relatively unchallenged.

� UF INCLUDED ON LIST OF TOP 
19 MOST FUN-LOVING SCHOOLS.
DANIEL ELSESSER
Alligator Contributing Writer
A new list confirmed what any Florida 
football fan or Humans vs. Zombies player 
could have said: Gators just want to have fun.
UF was recently selected as one of the 
top 19 “Colleges for the Most Fun-Loving” by InsideCollege.com, which creates col-lege lists based on expert opinions, student reviews and statistics. 
The list ordered schools alphabetically 
and does not indicate ranking within the list. 
InsideCollege used input from high school counselors, admissions representa-tives and educational planners to compile the list.
Two other Florida schools, the Univer -
sity of Miami and Rollins College, made the list.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said the 
volume and variety of UF’s activities make student life fun.
“There are nearly 1,000 student clubs on 
campus, to give an idea of how much stu-dents here like to be active,” Orlando said. 
Senior Lesleyanne Drake said students 
create a nonjudgmental atmosphere and a diverse campus. She thought the “fun-loving” label sounded more positive than a “party school” status.
UF is also on InsideCollege’s lists of 
“The 50 Most Stressful Colleges” and “Col-leges Ranked Highest in Sexual Health.”UF one of top fun-loving colleges ADRIANNA PAIDAS

One year ago, the Gainesville City Com-
mission ruled that 64-year-old Gainesville 
resident Bruce Baber couldn’t run his dog-sitting business from his home because it was against city codes. 
Baber has since been waiting for the com-
mission to change its mind. 
To his dismay Thursday night, the com-
mission — in a 4 to 3 vote — again ruled against a petition that would allow dog-sitting businesses in single-family neighbor -
hoods.
Mayor Craig Lowe, commissioners Scher -
win Henry , Susan Bottcher and Todd Chase voted against the petition. Commissioners Thomas Hawkins, Jeanna Mastrodicasa and Randy Wells voted in support.
“We cannot make a decision for an entire 
city based on one person,” Bottcher said.
After apologizing to Baber, Chase said 
residential dog-walking businesses wouldn’t help his district.
About 10 residents voiced opinions 
of Baber’s business, some for and some against.
Those against the petition said dog-sitting 
businesses would cause too much noise and too much traffic. Some of Baber’s neighbors have already complained of excessive bark-
ing.
Baber’s next-door 
neighbors, Michael and June Bowe, said it was simple: Commercial busi-nesses should not be run in residential areas.
“It wasn’t about Bab-
er,” he said. “We wish him all the best. But no 
commercial businesses should be in residen-tial neighborhoods.”
Those who supported Baber said his 
business wasn’t disruptive.
Baber, who walked out of City Hall with 
his head down, refused to comment.Dog-walker permit denied again

Susan G. Komen for the Cure 
Foundation, the nation’s leading 
breast cancer charity organization, ended its six-year partnership with the Planned Parenthood Federa-tion of America on Wednesday.
Nineteen Planned Parenthood 
affiliates will no longer receive funding from the Susan G. Komen Foundation, according to a state-ment on Planned Parenthood’s website.
Planned Parenthood said long-
term pressure from anti-abortion groups following the publicizing of Susan G. Komen Foundation’s partnership with the Women’s Health Services in 2005 led to the split.
“We are alarmed and saddened 
that the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation appears to have succumbed to political pressure,” said Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood, in a state-ment. “Our greatest desire is for Komen to reconsider this policy and recommit to the partner -
ship on which so many women count.”
Staci Fox, president and CEO 
of Planned Parenthood of North Florida, said the North Florida af-filiate was not one of the 19 affect-ed by the foundation’s decision to cut funds. 
“We’re continuing to do what 
we do every day, which is take care of the women, men and teens who come to see us for critical health care services,” she said. “That’s re-ally our focus.”
The Susan G. Komen Founda-
tion spokeswoman Leslie Aun told the Associated Press that Planned Parenthood is under investiga-tion by Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., to determine if the organization is using federal money to fund abor -tions. 
Aun said the organization’s de-
cision to end the partnership with Planned Parenthood was based on a new policy that cuts funding to organizations under investigation by local, state or federal authori-ties.
The foundation granted the 19 
affiliates about $680,000 last year and $580,000 the previous year for breast cancer screenings and breast health education, Fox said. 
Planned Parenthood has about 
79 locally governed affiliates na-tionwide operating almost 800 health centers and is the largest provider of abortions in the U.S.
Founded in 1982, the Susan G. 
Komen Foundation has donated more than $1.9 billion to breast cancer research, health services and advocacy. 
Fox said 24 hours after the 
foundation’s decision, about 6,000 donors nationwide raised $400,000 in support of the 19 Planned Par -
enthood affiliates.
“Our donors have really 
stepped up and given online and directly to our affiliates to help support that funding loss,” she said.

Florida junior tennis player Bob van Overbeek said this weekend’s match against No. 2 
Virginia will serve as a gauge for determining just how good the team is this season. 
� NO. 5 MEN TRAVEL TO NO. 2 UVA 
WHILE TOP-RANKED WOMEN MEET NO. 5 BAYLOR ON ROAD.
ELI MARGER
Alligator Writer
 
After opening the season largely with-
out being challenged, the Florida men’s 
and women’s tennis teams will take trips to nationally ranked teams in what is sure to be a difficult weekend of tennis for both.
The No. 5 men’s team (3-0) will travel 
to Charlottesville, Va., for an indoor match against No. 2 Virginia on Saturday at 1 p.m. 
The No. 1 women (2-0) will travel to 
Waco, Texas, for a match against No. 5 Baylor also on Saturday at 1 p.m. 
For the women, who have yet to drop 
a point, Baylor will be a barometer match to truly gauge Florida’s progress. After two relatively easy wins against Troy and UCF, the Gators will use this match at Bay-lor to get ready for a very tough stretch of matches that includes a trip to No. 2 Stan-ford next weekend.
The men, who qualified last weekend 
for the ITA Indoor Nationals in Charlottes-ville, will be facing the tougher challenge, playing the No. 2 team in the country. Plus, the fact that Virginia plays indoors changes the dynamic of the match.
“The time that you have in between 
shots is significantly less, which drastically impacts play,” coach Andy Jackson said. “It’s a faster game, which gives (a player) less time to make his swings.”
“The easiest way to explain it,” he said, 
“is that it’s why (Rafael) Nadal always beats (Roger) Federer on clay, and why Federer generally plays much better on in-doors or hard.”
The Cavaliers also feature two of the na-
tion’s top-15 singles players. No. 1 Mitchell Frank and No. 11 Jarmere Jenkins will be the two best Florida has faced this season. 
Virginia also has four doubles teams 
ranked in the top 50 in the nation. In that sense, Florida will enter this match as un-derdogs.
“We had Billy (Federhofer) and Nas-
sim (Slilam) play in the national indoors in the fall and they did pretty good,” junior Bob van Overbeek said, “and we had the warm-up tournament in Kentucky on in-door courts. So this will be our first collec-
tive team effort indoors against one of the top teams in the country.”
Part of the goal of the 
weekend is to prepare for the Indoor Na-tionals next month, but a more pressing one is to see how the team fares against elite competition. 
Much like the women will be tested at 
Baylor, the men will use this weekend’s match as the first true test of the team’s ability. 
“We’re looking forward to going and 
using them as a measuring stick to see where we are right now,” he said. 
“We know we’re good, but we don’t 
know how good, and we’ll see after this weekend.”Top-five teams present stiffest

Florida freshman guard Brad Beal scored 17 points and grabbed 11 
rebounds Thursday in the Gators’ 74-66 win against South Carolina.
� UF WON 74-66 THURSDAY.

When South Carolina hosted 
Florida nearly three weeks ago, the 
Gamecocks allowed their visitors to shoot 50 percent from three and steal their first road win of the sea-son before they left town.
On Thursday night at the 
O’Connell Center, the Gamecocks proved to be a far less gracious de-fensive team. 
Due to a season-low 25 percent 
shooting effort from three, the No. 12 Gators (18-4, 6-1 Southeastern Conference) were forced to hit the glass and clean up their misses to hold on in a 74-66 win against the Gamecocks (9-12, 1-6 SEC).
“We almost got caught because 
I didn’t think we had great matu-rity and understanding about the things you can control,” UF coach Billy Donovan said. “I told the players after the game, ‘If you can control shooting the ball, we’d nev-er miss a shot.’”
While Donovan described the 
Gators’ offensive performance as woeful, Florida’s players main-tained a frenetic pace on the boards whenever they did miss.
Florida’s 22 field goals on 59 
shots were the second-fewest its made all season, but the team made up for it by garnering a 42-30 edge on the boards and scoring 17 sec-ond-chance points off  20 offensive rebounds.
“What won the game for us 
[Thursday] was that we really did a great job getting to the offensive glass,” Donovan said. 
After an early barrage of three 
3-pointers from Florida guards Kenny Boynton and Erving Walker built a double-digit lead just under seven minutes into the game, South Carolina clamped down its perime-ter defense with an extended zone. The Gamecocks held the Gators to 1 of 13 from three in the second half. 
The switch from a man-to-man 
defense sent the Gators’ field-goal shooting into a tailspin, but yielded plenty of chances for offensive re-bounds, which freshman Brad Beal took full advantage of. 
Despite going up against the 
SEC’s top defensive rebounding team, the 6-foot-3 Beal hauled in five of his 11 rebounds on the of-fensive glass and scored 17 points on 5-of-11 shooting. 
“Coach got in our heads all 
week in practice about the (small forward, power forward and cen-ters) going for the offensive re-bound,” Beal said. “In the first half we had 14, so I really wanted to at-tack the glass because they weren’t blocking out.”
Beal, who leads Florida in de-
fensive rebounds this season, had been held without an offensive board in four of his six previous SEC games.
The Gators, meanwhile, were 
out-rebounded as a team in four of their last five heading into Thurs-day.
“Me probably being on him 
the last two days, telling him he’s got two offensive rebounds in six games maybe had something to do with it, too,” Donovan said. “[Beal] and Erik Murphy, if you look at the SEC (schedule), Kenny Boynton has more offensive rebounds than both.”
Boynton, who finished with 
three rebounds, and Walker reached double-figures in scoring with 24 and 14, respectively, but no other Florida players scored more than five points.
Boynton, on a 4-of-8 perfor -
mance from three, helped seal the victory and extend the Gators’ per -
fect home record to 12-0 with five of his game-high eight free throws in the final 1:09.
“In my freshman year, we kind 
of let some home wins slip away,” Boynton said. “We learned from those and we just got to keep mov-ing forward.”

No Jordan Jones, no problem for 
the Gators.
Without its second-leading 
scorer and team captain, Florida 
completed just its season sweep of LSU in program history with a 73-64 victory on the road Thursday night.
Jones, a redshirt senior guard, 
was ruled out before tip-off due to a concussion suffered during last Sunday’s game against Arkansas.
“Our seniors, collectively, really 
did a great job,” coach Amanda Butler said. “It’s just really hard to point out one or two people be-cause it really truly was a team ef-fort.”
One senior who stepped up to 
fill the void left by Jones was center Azania Stewart.
She finished the game with 12 
points and 10 rebounds — both team-best marks — recording her first  double-double of the season.
Joining Stewart with solid ef-
forts in the post were redshirt se-nior Ndidi Madu and junior Jenni-fer George.
Madu scored a season-high 12 
points while George chipped in nine, but the duo managed just three combined rebounds.
George’s numbers were lower 
than her season averages due in part to her early foul trouble.
“Azania was absolutely huge, Ndidi’s play was huge,” Butler said. “George gave us a spurt there for a while when we did go a little bit cold.”
George was one of three Gators 
— joining senior 
guards Deana Allen and Lanita Bartley — to re-cord two fouls in the first eight minutes of the game. 
Due to a com-
bination of Jones’ injury and early foul trouble for Allen and Bartley, freshman Andrea Vilaro Aragones assumed an increased role.
The Spanish guard provided a 
boost in the transition game and the press for Florida, setting career-high marks with 24 minutes, five points and a team-best four steals.
“Since we were a little bit short-
handed and got ourselves in some foul trouble, we started to get a little bit tired,” Butler said. 
“When one person went out, 
someone else stepped in and took up the slack.”
Aragones was part of a balanced 
offensive game from the guard po-sition.
In addition to Aragones’ five, 
Bartley tied for the team lead with 12 points while Allen and sopho-more Jaterra Bonds scored nine each.
For the fourth time this season, 
every player that saw the floor scored.
“We were doing a pretty good 
job of moving the ball around and took, for the most part, pretty good shots on the outside,” Butler said. “We talked about not shooting our -
selves out of it.” 
While Florida managed offen-
sively sans Jones, the team also turned in a solid defensive perfor -
mance.
The Gators scored 26 points off 
22 turnovers by the Tigers.
“We had so much more focus on 
playing great defense than hitting shots,” Butler said. “We just weren’t concerned about that. We knew we would hit enough (shots).”

THE TOM GREEN SHOW
Coffee is for closers.
It’s an iconic line from an 
Alec Baldwin monologue in 
the film adaptation of “Glengarry 
Glen Ross,” which is about the cut-throat real estate business. The monologue details how the agents need to stick to their ABCs (Always Be Closing) and do one simple thing: Get the clients to sign on the dotted line. 
That line, and that basic mantra, 
also applies to the equally cutthroat business of college football recruit-ing.
And when it comes to this re-
cruiting cycle, Florida coach Will Muschamp didn’t earn his coffee on National Signing Day. The Gators whiffed on more than a handful of top undecided prospects on Wednes-day, including five-star recruits Tracy Howard (Miami), Nelson Agholor (USC) and Josh Harvey-Clemons (Georgia) that would have, in all likelihood, netted Florida the mythi-cal recruiting national title.
But that’s OK, because while 
Muschamp didn’t close on a lot of sales pitches on National Signing Day and many Gators fans are sure to be disappointed by the players he missed out on, he made waves in his first year recruiting in the Southeast-ern Conference as a head coach.
Despite a six-loss season that in-
cluded a winless October, Muschamp brought in quite a haul in 2012. 
I know the stars rating system 
used by recruiting services is a crap-shoot, but the raw numbers show Florida tied with Alabama, Stan-ford and USC for the most five-star signees this cycle. The Gators were hands down the worst of those teams last season, and it wasn’t even close.
Should wide receiver Stefon Diggs sign with Florida in a week when he makes his decision pub-lic, he would give Florida more five-stars than any 
other team in the nation.
Ratings aside, Florida’s coaching 
staff raided North Carolina for four of the top 14 recruits in the state, in-cluding the top two. The Gators ad-dressed their two biggest areas of concern by signing 14 line-of-scrim-mage players. They picked up one of the best cornerbacks in the nation to play opposite Marcus Roberson, added another quarterback late in the process and picked up the type of running back UF needs to establish a power running game by signing the 6-foot-3, 225-pound Matt Jones.
Although momentum appeared 
to slow by a somewhat disappoint-ing closeout on Wednesday, the Gators are still picking up steam on the recruiting trail, adding a pair of 2013 oral commitments Thursday, bringing the next class to four al-ready, with all four on the ESPNU 150 watch list.
As Muschamp posted Thursday 
morning on Twitter, you have to re-cruit every day. He has done just that despite Wednesday’s oh-fer on the top uncommitted prospects.
Who cares about being able to 
close on that one day of the year when you are making your imprint the other 364?
Besides, we have all seen Mus-
champ on the sidelines; he doesn’t need coffee.

In a chaotic and overwhelm-
ing environment last Friday, 
UF’s gymnastics team compet-ed against an elite Southeast-ern Conference opponent.
The same goes for tonight, 
but this time the crowd will be twice as large and won’t be Gator chomping. 
After defeating No. 1 Ar-
kansas in a busy quad meet last Friday and totaling a 197.775, the fifth-highest team score in school history, No. 3 Florida (6-0, 2-0 SEC) will take on defending national cham-pion No. 6 Alabama (5-0, 2-0 SEC) in the Coleman Coliseum in Tuscaloosa, Ala., tonight at 8:30.
The Crimson Tide have lost 
only five times at home in the last decade, and the team’s at-tendance ranks among the na-tion’s leaders, as the Coleman Coliseum can hold a maximum capacity of 15,075 for gymnas-tics. 
The last time the Gators 
won in a dual meet in Tusca-loosa was in 1979.
“I did hear that there’s 
15,000 people,” said Kytra Hunter, who was named SEC Freshman of the Week for the second week in a row. “It’s go-ing to be fun. We did compete against a No. 1 team and we can beat [Alabama]. You never know what’s going to come out.” 
Alabama averaged 11,971 
fans per meet last season, and in its home opener against Geor -
gia on Jan. 13, the attendance was 14,501, more than triple the O’Connell Center crowd of 4,796 that attended the Gators’ season debut against Illinois-Chicago three weeks ago.
While the Gators are battle-
tested after last Friday’s quad meet win, the atmosphere in Tuscaloosa presents a whole new challenge for coach Rhon-da Faehn’s young squad.
“Over 50-60 percent of the 
team has never been there,” Faehn said. 
“It’s going to be a great ex-
perience for them to be able to see a very competitive envi-ronment, probably the largest crowd we’ll ever encounter this season.”
During the last decade, 
Florida vs. Alabama has been a very competitive rivalry, as the home team has won in the reg-ular season the last nine years. 
The two squads have also 
won four of the last five SEC Championships. Since 2007, the two teams are even at 8-8-1.
In 2011, the Gators hand-
ed the Crimson Tide its first loss of the regular season in a 197.550-195.450 clobber -
ing in Gainesville. But Ala-bama went on to win SEC and NCAA Championships, while UF placed second at the SECs and missed the cut to make the NCAA Super Six by .75 points.
Alabama is coming off a 
nail-biting 196.325-196.250 win against No. 16 Auburn on the road last Friday. While the Tide don’t have any all-around competitors ranked in the top 25 nationally, it holds the No. 1 vault average in the country (49.333).
Faehn is still determining 
if her four main all-around competitors — juniors Maris-sa King and SEC Gymnast of the Week Ashanée Dickerson, sophomore Alaina Johnson and Hunter — will play the same role tonight, although she said the lineups will look similar to last Friday’s rotations. 
“We’re going to do what 
Rhonda said and stay in our own little bubble,” Dickerson said. 
“(We’re not going to) worry 
about what the other team is doing and what the crowd is doing because they want us to mess up.”
