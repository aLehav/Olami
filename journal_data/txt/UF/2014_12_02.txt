Maggie barked in excitement as her new owners walked 
through a gated fence Monday afternoon during the 11th 
Paws on Parole ceremony.
The ceremony was hosted by the Alachua County Sher-
iff’s Ofﬁ  ce, and it marked the graduation of two dogs — Maggie, a 10-month-old mixed-breed puppy, and another mixed-breed dog in the program, Cedric.
Through the Paws on Parole Unleashed program, fe-
male inmates from the Alachua County Jail train the dogs for adoption from the Alachua County Animal Shelter. The program lasts about eight weeks.
Inmates earn the opportunity to train dogs if they have 
“good behavior and willingness to learn and contribute,” said Alachua County Sheriff Sadie Darnell.
Both Cedric and Maggie performed actions like sitting, 
staying, shaking and working through an obstacle course 
Monday — a feat which was met with “oohs” and “ahs” 
from the crowd of about 30.
At the end of the ceremony, the inmates who trained 
Maggie and Cedric and the dogs’ new owners were given certiﬁ  cates of completion.
Rose Mansﬁ  eld, 9, smiled as she talked about her new 
four-legged family member.
“I love her,” she said. “We like to play around the house, 
and she likes to sleep with us in our bed at night.”Paws on Parole celebrates its 11th graduation

Christmas just came early for cookie lov-
ers who will now be able to order Girl Scout 
Cookies online for the ﬁ  rst time ever.
Local troops in the Girl Scouts of Gateway 
Council will sell the cookies electronically as 
part of the Girl Scouts of the United States of 
America’s new digital cookie program.
“It’s just another element that brings the 
cookie program into the 21st century,” said 
Girl Scouts of Gateway Council CEO Mary Anne Jacobs.
To order the cookies online, a Girl Scout 
must email a link to her customized personal website. The cookies can then be shipped to any doorstep in the U.S.
The online component won’t eliminate 
the face-to-face or door-to-door aspect of cookie selling, Jacobs said, but it will make it easier to distribute the treats.
“The internet is a critical component to 
doing business,” Jacobs said. “We’re trying to teach them the importance of technol-ogy.”
The new program is expected to signiﬁ  -
cantly increase sales, Jacobs said. Each box of cookies will be $4.
Local troops will start selling cookies 
Sunday at the Gateway Council’s Third An-
nual Cookie Kickoff, which will take place at 
EverBank Field before the Jacksonville Jag-uars game.
Jacobs said she’s excited because Girl 
Scouts will be gaining real-world experience in today’s technological business environ-ment.
“It’s not just about selling cookies any-
more,” Jacobs said. “They’re learning how 
to reach out and identify their target buyers 
and build a list of clients.”
Jacobs said local Girl Scouts set their own 
quotas, and each troop decides how the raised money will be spent.
Gateway Council Service Unit Manager 
Cindy Laukert, who oversees 25 of Gaines-ville’s nearly 150 troops, said the digital Girl Scouts to move cookie 
enterprise to Thin Minternet

Following a weekend of late-night 
deals and Monday’s online discounts, 
a new initiative is trending — giving back. 
Giving Tuesday is a global move-
ment intended to counter the consum-erism encouraged through Black Friday and Cyber Monday and instead to in-spire people to give back, according to the movement’s website. This year, both Operation Catnip and Helping Hands Rescue are participating. 
The local organizations partnered up 
to transform how people think, talk and 
feel about #GivingTuesday, said Kristie 
Herniman, vice president of Helping Hands Rescue. Both organizations are not-for-proﬁ  t and rely on donations of time, money and supplies to operate. Organizations began accepting do-
nations online at 12:01 a.m. at www.givingtuesday.org and will continue until midnight.
For those who choose to donate, 
Herniman said Network for Good will match all pledges, which means even a 
$10 donation can become $20. Network 
for Good will donate up to $125,000 in matching funds, she said. 
“We will throw everything — even 
the kitchen sink — to help save the pets to keep them healthy and keep them alive,” Herniman said. 
She said the rescue organization 
aims to replenish medical funds already spent with the donations received — like the $4,500 spent to save a puppy named Boe recently — and also aim to create a safety net for unexpected emer-Post-consumerist holiday

Just after 9 p.m. Monday, an eerie quiet 
fell over Norman ﬁ  eld. Sobs cut through 
the night.
More than 300 people formed a jagged 
circle on the back end of the ﬁ  eld.
They were a protective capsule around 
a smaller group of girls crying — and later praying — for Tampa teen Jacqueline Fair-
cloth.
The prayer circle honored 18-year-old 
Faircloth, who was hit by a car while vis-
iting family in Tallahassee early Saturday 
morning and remains in a medically in-
duced coma.
The H.B. Plant High School senior 
stepped onto Pensacola Street when wit-
nesses said a red or silver SUV struck her 
then the driver ﬂ  ed the scene.
As of Monday morning, Faircloth was 
in stable-but-critical condition, according to a family member who posted on the 
Facebook page “Pray for Jackie.” The post 
expressed concerns about brain swelling following the emergency surgery she re-ceived after being rushed to Tallahassee 
Memorial Hospital that night.
“They are keeping a very close eye on 
her today and keeping her room very, very 
quiet so that nothing will stimulate her and risk causing any more swelling,” the 
post said. “All the machines in her room 
are doing their job, her numbers are for-tunately still in the good range and she is still ﬁ  ghting.”
Faircloth’s brother, JT Faircloth, and 
cousins Billy and Kelly Darnell attend 
Florida State University.Her cousins Katie and Brooke Faircloth 
attend UF.
Katie and Brooke were embraced at 
the center of the prayer circle Monday 
by friends — some of whom didn’t know 
Jackie.
Liz Leverone, a 19-year-old UF family, 
youth and community sciences freshman 
and longtime friend of Faircloth, organized the event and led the group in prayer.
“Give Jackie your light in this dark-
ness,” Leverone prayed. “We need her.”A group of six friends took turns lead-
ing the group praying for Faircloth. Many held hands while snifﬂ  es rippled through the group.
Lauren Maloney, a 19-year-old UF pub-
lic relations sophomore and a friend of Faircloth’s, also prayed for the driver.
“If there is anyone who knows the 
person who was driving the car, be with them,” she prayed. “Do not hold your 
mercy from them. Lord, as you know what 
lies in the darkness, reveal this darkness to the driver, and bring it to light.”
After the prayers, smaller groups 
formed to continue praying for Faircloth, while others wrote messages on multicol-ored Post-it notes to send to her family.
Many spoke fondly of Faircloth, calling 
her an athletic and spirited girl.
“A lot of people really liked her,” Malo-
ney said. “She’d light up a room. You can’t not smile after talking to her.”
Maloney smiled remembering Fair-
cloth’s love of the sea.
“She is someone that is not afraid to go 
out and catch a big ﬁ  sh and show every-
one,” she said.
Hannah Wannamaker, a 19-year-old UF 
marine sciences freshman, said she was a 
cheerleader and a swimmer with Fair-cloth.
“She is so strong, too, and I know she 
can get through this,” Wannamaker said.
For more than an hour, the event was 
pierced with moments of uncontrollable 
sobs.
Brooke sat in a circle of 14 girls near the 
middle of the ﬁ  eld staring at the ground 
crying as two friends hugged her on each side.
Family and friends of Faircloth selected 
a 15-minute time slot from 4:30 p.m. Mon-day to 4:30 p.m. today to pray for her re-covery.
The family is offering a $20,000 reward 
to anyone who comes forward with infor-mation that leads to the driver’s arrest and conviction.
Tallahassee Police ask that anyone with 
information call 850-891-4200 or Crime Stoppers at 850-574-8177.TUESDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3  Salesperson of the Month

A Gainesville Police officer 
was fired after he had sex with a 
young woman and illegally gave 
her alcohol about 44 days after he 
arrested the woman for shoplift-
ing at a Target. 
Chief Tony Jones signed the 
officer’s termination form on 
Oct. 22 after an internal investi-
gation uncovered that Robert V. Gebhardt visited the 19-year-old woman while she was in jail af-
ter he arrested her on March 23, 
2013. The woman told officers that Gebhardt was flirtatious 
while driving her to jail.
The report said after the ar-
rest, Gebhardt also went to a 
known drug house to look for the 
woman, whom he knew to have 
a narcotics problem. Further in-vestigations concluded that Geb-hardt also went on a date with the young woman, paid her $50 
for sex and gave her alcoholic 
beverages.
The report says Gebhardt was 
well aware that the woman was 
involved in criminal activity. He 
also knew that the woman was on probation in Marion County and has a history of drug problems 
and a criminal background.
When Gebhardt visited the 
woman at the Alachua County 
Jail 15 days after her arrest, he 
gave her his phone number and 
business card, according to a re-port. During the one-hour visit, he told the woman to call him when she was released so he 
could take her out.
Forty-four days after Geb-
hardt arrested the woman, he 
picked her up from her uncle’s 
house and took her out to din-
ner at Ichiban Sushi. The two then went back to his apartment, where a report said they stayed 
until the early morning to have 
sex and drink Coke and whiskey. At some point, the woman went into the bathroom to smoke crack 
and then asked Gebhardt to take 
her home. Gebhardt offered her $50 to stay.
During a criminal interview 
following the incident with the 
19-year-old, Gebhardt denied ev-
erything.
On Nov. 4, 2011 Gebhardt was 
disciplined for personally visit-
ing other inmates and “associat-
ing with known offenders and persons of questionable reputa-tion.”
Other Gainesville Police of-
ficers have engaged in improp-er sexual activity in the past and have been fired for it, GPD 
spokesman Ben Tobias said. 
In 2010, David Reveille was 
arrested and sent to prison for 
two years after he forced prosti-tutes to have sex with him while 
he was on duty. 
In 2009, Bill Billings was ar-
rested on charges of scheme to 
defraud and misconduct for pay-
ing a woman to have sex with 
him while on duty.GPD officer fired for inappropriate sexual conduct with inmate
� FACULTY CHOSEN TO 
BE FELLOW.
SHELBY DAVIDSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
The world’s largest general 
scientific society has honored 
six UF faculty for their re-
search contributions.
The American Associa-
tion for the Advancement of 
Science is a nonprofit organi-
zation that annually honors individuals whose efforts to 
advance science or its applica-
tions are scientifically or so-
cially distinguished.
“The AAAS is a well-rec-
ognized and prestigious orga-
nization, and our researchers 
who have been recognized 
join an elite group of their 
colleagues from around the 
country,” said UF spokesman 
Steve Orlando.
The UF faculty were cho-
sen to be fellows from a list 
of nominees made by a com-mittee within the organiza-
tion. They now join 37 other 
UF professors who have been 
honored since the association 
was founded. UF President-
elect Kent Fuchs was honored 
in 2010.
One of the individuals 
honored as a fellow was Wolf-gang Sigmund, a UF College 
of Engineering materials sci-
ence professor. 
Sigmund said he was rec-
ognized for his research on us-
ing an electric field to modify 
the size of objects.
“It’s really a good feeling 
to get high recognition for that type of achievement in 
my field of work because you 
have to have great work for an 
extended period of time,” he 
said. “I had hoped to get this 
recognition at some point in 
my career but I did not expect 
it so soon.”Bruce MacFadden, curator 
of vertebrate paleontology at 
the Florida Museum of Natu-
ral History, was also chosen as 
a fellow for his contributions to the field of paleontology. 
He said it is an honor be-
cause it recognizes his schol-arly achievements thus far.
“I will continue what I’ve 
been doing to keep represent-ing UF as an AAAS scholar in the best way possible,” Mac-
Fadden said.
Among the other profes-
sors recognized as fellows are 
Cammy Abernathy, dean of 
the UF College of Engineer-
ing; Robert Cousins, Boston 
Family Professor of Nutrition; 
Andrew Hanson, professor of horticultural sciences in 
the Institute of Food and Ag-ricultural Sciences and Ann 
Progulske-Fox, professor of oral biology in the UF College of Dentistry. 
In order to be an eligible 
nominee, professors are re-quired to be a member of the association for four years and 
submit a nomination form, a 
list of their top 10 most sig-
nificant publications, a cur-
riculum vitae and a letter from 
each of their three sponsors. 
MacFadden said he is look-
ing forward to being honored 
in person with his colleagues 
at the AAAS’ annual meet-
ing in San Diego, California, in February. Each new fellow 
will be inducted and receive a 
certificate and rosette.
Becoming a fellow is a sig-
nificant accomplishment, and 
UF is very proud of these six 
honorees, Orlando said.
“The number of recogni-
tions from AAAS has been increasing over time, which is 
a great thing,” Orlando said. 
“It’s a good indication that 
the university is headed in the 
right direction.”Six UF faculty win for

Online option won’t end regular sales
cookie program will make it easier for Girl Scouts to 
send cookies to non-local family members.
“If Aunt Susan in Tennessee orders it online, the 
girl here in Gainesville gets credit for the cookie sale,” she said. “But they do have to pay for ship-
ping.”
Laukert said the girls in her troops are excited.
“They’re happy to be able to do it online and be able to increase their sales by sending them to people that they couldn’t reach in the first place,” she said.  
Ashlyn Reese, a UF telecommunication and crim-
inology junior, said she doesn’t normally buy Girl Scout cookies but might this year now that they’re online.
“It’s definitely less personal, but that’s the world 
we live in,” the 21-year-old said. “I’d probably be more willing to buy them online.”GirL SCout S, from page 1
Local organizations are participating
gencies like Boe’s.
“We will always, always make 
the choice to take care of the pet in-
stead of euthanizing it,” she said. 
UF public relations senior Isabella 
Elsheikh said she recently adopted a cat from Gainesville Pet Rescue and she supports local rescue organiza-tions using Giving Tuesday to raise more funds.“I think it was smart to incorpo-
rate the giving hashtag right after Black Friday and Cyber Monday,” 
the 21-year-old said. “People are still 
out shopping, and if they are aware of this trend they could be more like-ly to adopt or donate.” 
Twitter played a large role in 
spreading the word about #Giving-Tuesday, Herniman said. She sent out tweets for about a month and a half leading up to the event, includ-ing tweeting back and forth with Operation Catnip to raise aware-ness.
Following the #GivingTuesday 
initiative, Herniman said the organi-zation is hosting a series of pet adop-tions this weekend at the PetSmart located on Southwest Archer Road.  
Gigi’s Playhouse Gainesville is 
also participating in the initiative and will accept donations through the same website.

Children kept in hospital isola-
tion will soon have a program to 
help them stay socially active. 
UF Health Child Life Program re-
ceived one of seven national “Heal-ing Power of Play” grants from the Mattel Children’s Foundation.
The $16,605 grant from the toy 
corporation organization goes di-
rectly to the Child Life Program to 
develop new programs for children who are not able to leave their hos-pital rooms to access play therapies.These children may be in isola-
tion due to particular illnesses that compromise their immune systems.
Mark Amox, administrator of UF 
Health Shands Children’s Hospital, said the application for the grant was turned in at the beginning of the Fall semester.
“The Mattel Foundation puts out 
requests for proposals from chil-dren’s hospitals across the country,” he said. “We’ve applied before, but this was the year they gave us the funding.”
With new programs available to 
them, patients will be able to stay in their rooms where different tools 
and techniques are brought to them.
The grant will be implemented 
this winter and will provide pa-
tients with therapeutic interactions through the use of play kits, a “mo-bile playroom” and a multisensory cart.
Fifty to 70 percent of patients at 
the UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital are kept isolated in their rooms. The hospital works with par-ents and families who are actively involved in their childrens’ ability to remain children, Amox said.
“Any time a child is in the hos-
pital, we know that the more we 
can distract them from a stressful 
environment and provide a more routine life experience, we know that that aids in the child’s ability to heal,” he said.
One of the hospital’s biggest chal-
lenges is managing the expectations of parents.
“If they have a child that is infec-tious or contagious,” he said. “Then we cannot allow those kids to be around other kids. That’s where things like these programs can help those kids cope with their hospital stay.”
Jaimin Patel, a 22-year-old UF 
biology senior, has volunteered at Shands since his sophomore year and said volunteering in the pediat-rics ward was a memorable experi-ence.
“It’s sad to see some of those kids 
not be able to play with other kids their own age or use the tools that are available to the others,” he said. 
Playtime makes a comeback for child patients at Shands
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
PHILADELPHIA — Bill Cosby stepped down as 
a trustee of Temple University following renewed 
accusations that he had drugged and sexually as-saulted a string of women over many years.
The 77-year-old entertainer has been a high-pro-
ﬁ  le booster for his alma mater in Philadelphia and a board member since 1982.
“I have always been proud of 
my association with Temple Uni-versity. I have always wanted to do what would be in the best 
interests of the university and its students. As a result, I have ten-dered my resignation,” Cosby said in a statement released by the university.
Board chairman Patrick 
O’Connor told The Associated Press that the come-dian does not want to be a distraction.
“The Board of Trustees accepts Dr. Cosby’s res-
ignation ... and thanks him for his service,” the uni-versity said in its release.
O’Connor had defended Cosby in a 2005 civil 
suit ﬁ  led by a former Temple basketball employee who accused Cosby of drugging and molesting her at his suburban Philadelphia mansion a year earlier. 
Cosby, who said he gave the woman only Benadryl, 
later settled the lawsuit for undisclosed terms.
More than a dozen other women have come 
forward since the lawsuit was ﬁ  led to make simi-lar claims, including several who have gone public this month. Some said they passed out after taking a drink or pill from him and woke up with their clothes askew and, in some cases, in physical pain.
Cosby has strongly denied wrongdoing and has never been criminally charged. A suburban Phila-delphia prosecutor declined to ﬁ  le charges in the 2005 case, and most of the other women came for-ward too late.
“He didn’t comment on the allegations (Mon-
day),” O’Connor said. “They were from (as long as) 50 years ago.”
Cosby, who was born and raised in Philadel-
phia, has been one of Temple’s most famous alumni and a frequent commencement speaker.
Several other colleges have also severed their 
ties with Cosby in recent weeks. The Berklee Col-lege of Music will no longer award a scholarship in Cosby’s name, and the University of Massachusetts-Amherst had him step down as honorary co-chair-man of their $300 million fundraising campaign.
At Temple, an online petition urging the univer-
sity to cut ties with Cosby had garnered more than 1,000 signatures by Monday afternoon.
The accusations, although unproven, “got to the 
point where the reputation of the institution started to get dragged down with (them),” said Raymond Smeriglio, president of the student body.
Although willing to play the public face of Tem-
ple in advertisements, fundraising campaigns and 
commencement speeches, Cosby was a rare sight at 
board meetings. A review of minutes to 138 board meetings held since 1982 suggests he attended just once — in December 2002, when he was on campus to ﬁ  lm a Temple women’s basketball commercial.
But his commencement speeches were wildly 
popular, and he gave a welcome lecture to fresh-men classes called “Cosby 101.”
Trustee Anthony McIntyre said the latest accu-
sations — sparked by a comedian who called Cosby a rapist in a recent performance — presented a “no-win situation” for the Temple community.Bill Cosby resigns from Temple

Black Friday?Today’s question: Will you buy Girl Scout Cookies 
online? Traditions, family will always count
This past weekend, still recovering from our Thanksgiv-
ing feast, I participated with my family in our tradi-tion of having Saturday morning breakfast at Einstein 
Bros. Bagels. We’ve been doing this every week since before my younger sister was born — almost 17 years. We’ve cy-
cled through all the menu and manager changes as time has 
passed and are familiarized as regulars by the staff.
The way the cashier knows my family’s entire order be-
fore I even open my mouth is almost embarrassing, but there is also a certain comfortable familiarity to it. I’m known here and welcome.
Needless to say, my family is a rather habitual lot.Our routine is always the same: buy a newspaper, order 
a bagel and some “darn good” coffee and settle in for a good 
three hours of companionable conversation, crossword puz-
zles and morning comics.
I feel a certain pride about my family’s loyalty to Einstein’s 
— or simply “Bagels” as my parents call it — by now.
There have been serious conversations over our bagel 
table, big laughs and memories that I look back on fondly.
Our particular Einstein’s restaurant is a place where I 
have practically grown up. I remember when I was too small to easily reach the sink in the tiny bathroom. When I was 10, 
my classic order was a bagel with jelly, and I would care-
fully slurp all of the strawberry jam out of the toasted honey wheat bagel’s crevices, feeling rather like an excavator of some ancient, tasty monument.
One rainy Saturday, my family created the plotline of a 
three-volume mystery book series, which I still need to write down in chapter format and sell — it will make us all famous, I’m sure.
What I’m getting at with all this talk of bagels and shmear 
is that traditions with family and friends are still important today.
Thanksgiving is a time for big traditions in many families, 
and the upcoming holiday season even more so. Sure, the holidays are a time when you might have to deal with press-ing questions about the future or skeptical raised eyebrows when speaking about your life goals, but it’s also an oppor-tunity to reafﬁ  rm the bonds you have with loved ones by tak-ing part in traditions that shaped every one of us into the people we are today.
My family is kind of tradition 
crazy: We have a practice for ev-
erything from watching “101 Dal-
matians” every New Year’s to Sat-urday bagels brunch to singing 10 different versions of “Happy Birth-day” every time someone grows 
another year older. However, I love this about my family. It makes us special. It reminds me how much I appreciate them all.
Traditions are easy to implement, even in college, away 
from some of the places and people we have grown up with.
Whether it’s getting dinner at a particular restaurant with 
friends every month, or working out with your gym buddy every week, the habits we form with people close to us are what can make or break our experiences in college and in life.
They can seem like a big pain sometimes — when you 
have tests to study for, or perhaps when at home this winter 
break you’d much rather recover from the stress of the se-
mester instead of drag yourself to brunch — but these habits, customs and traditions with people close to us are worth it in the end. These are the things that can help ground the world around us into a little steadfast constancy, especially when it seems like nothing is permanent anymore.
My classes may change, my apartment may change, my 
life ambitions may change, but I will always have family brunch.
Ten years from now, we could all still be participating in 
certain traditions that we started as college students. Maybe you will still be attending that monthly dinner with friends — albeit with new faces or in a new setting. Perhaps one sunny Saturday morning I might take my own children out for breakfast bagels.

relationship corrupt 
‘revolving door’
The Miami Herald published a story Saturday about the close political relationship between former Florida Attor-ney General Bill McCollum and current AG Pam Bondi.
According to the Herald article, cruise line Royal Caribbean 
hired McCollum last year to work to alter a consumer protection 
agreement made with the AG’s ofﬁ  ce in 1997.
In June 2013, McCollum met with the staff of Bondi’s ofﬁ  ce. 
Six months later, Royal Caribbean’s request — that it not be re-
quired to “include fees for services, like baggage handling and loading cargo” as part of its advertised rates — was granted.
McCollum has also met with AG staff on behalf of two other 
clients: e-cigarette company NJOY and mobile health screening company HealthFair. When asked about the morality of using his inﬂ  uence as a former AG to meet with the current AG ofﬁ  ce 
on behalf of his clients, McCollum denied any ethical concerns.
“Are we being remunerated for our knowledge and know-
how? Yes, we are, and I don’t think that’s inappropriate.”
McCollum may be a very skilled lawyer, but his legal knowl-
edge is not the primary reason why Royal Caribbean and other 
companies have enlisted his services. They hired him because of his intimate connections with the AG’s ofﬁ  ce and his ability to direct government policy in his client’s favor.
McCollum also claimed that in his meetings with staff from 
AG’s ofﬁ  ce, he was not trying to “inﬂ  uence the attorney general” but simply “represent my client.” His actions perfectly represent the concept of the “revolving door”. Elected ofﬁ  cials leave of-ﬁ  ce to take lucrative jobs in the private sector, often as lobbyists, where they use their inﬂ  uence and connections to inﬂ  uence their successors and former colleagues in government.
Increasingly, this inﬂ  uence-peddling is being conducted by 
lawyers rather than registered lobbyists, making the process even more unaccountable and difﬁ  cult to track. The Herald only 
discovered the relationship between McCollum and Bondi’s 
ofﬁ  ce through emails exchanged between the former AG and Bondi aides.
The “revolving door” helps produce public policy that favors 
large corporations that can afford to hire high-proﬁ  le lobbyists and lawyers over small businesses and ordinary Floridians.
McCollum certainly has the right to earn a decent living us-
ing his skills as a lawyer. However, he should not be able to use his political reputation to help change Florida policies in ways 
that beneﬁ  t his corporate clients, especially without registering 
as a lobbyist ﬁ  rst.
Florida has a revolving-door law in place, but it only prevents 
former ofﬁ  ceholders from lobbying their previous position for two years. As corporations have moved away from hiring reg-istered lobbyists in favor of lawyers like McCollum, the law has become increasingly meaningless. Florida should expand these restrictions to include not just lobbying, but any form of com-munication between former and current ofﬁ  ceholders involving 
public business. Otherwise, the type of unethical corporate in-
ﬂ  uence personiﬁ  ed by McCollum will continue unabated.TUESDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2014

Last month, Republicans dominated mid-
term elections across the nation. No one can deny the power right-wing lawmakers 
will hold once January rolls around as they now enjoy a strong grip on two-thirds of state legisla-
tive bodies.
Unfortunately, the ﬂ  ood of Republican victo-
ries has paved the way for more restrictive and 
aggressive anti-abortion legislation. As I write this column, abortion opponents in various states have already crafted and proposed laws that severely intrude on the reproductive rights of women. Mandatory ultrasounds, increased wait-ing periods, restrictions on medicated abortion and harsher 
regulations on clinics are just some of the ways these propos-
als would make it harder for women to obtain an abortion.
A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll also shows that 
70 percent of Americans support Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision that protected abortion as a woman’s right. De-spite the beliefs of the American public, extreme anti-abortion legislation continues to sweep the nation.
Elected politicians are supposed to serve the people of their 
country or state, but this troubling trend shows just how little 
regard some of them hold for the health and well-being of 
their constituents. Conservative lawmakers need to acknowl-edge that abortion is a socioeconomic issue with real and last-ing implications for men, women and children, rather than just an ideological problem that they can arrogantly vote into oblivion.
Anti-abortion legislation disproportionately 
affects lower-income women. According to the 
Guttmacher Institute, more than 40 percent of 
women seeking abortions are at or below the federal poverty level. An additional 27 percent of women who obtain abortions earn slightly more but are still considered poor, and the majority of women seeking abortions already have one or more children.
Enacting restrictive anti-abortion legislation 
not only strips away a woman’s right to control her own body, 
but it also plunges families deeper into poverty. Depressingly, 
the politicians who try to restrict abortions are also the ones who tend to oppose social welfare programs, universal health care and minimum wage increases. Earlier this year, Senate Re-publicans defeated legislation that would raise the minimum wage, and House Republicans pushed for a bill that would cut billions of dollars from the federal food stamp program.
How can abortion opponents speak so vehemently about 
the value of life while they simultaneously push for legislation 
that worsens the plights of poverty-stricken men, women and 
children?
Sister Joan Chittister, a Benedictine nun, put it best when she famously explained the difference between pro-life and “pro-birth.” Chittister argued that the morality behind re-stricting abortion becomes questionable when “all you want is a child born but not a child fed, not a child educated, not a child housed.”
Rather than enact overreaching laws that restrict a person’s 
right to make personal medical decisions and ability to pro-vide for loved ones, abortion opponents should focus on solu-tions that are proven to reduce unintended pregnancies in the ﬁ  rst place.
Even though many conservative lawmakers passionately 
argue against these measures, comprehensive sex education in schools and easy access to birth control has consistently been proven to lower the rate of unintended pregnancies. It is 
difﬁ  cult to understand why these ideas have been so heavily 
challenged in conservative states. This is a solution that will signiﬁ  cantly reduce abortions without forcing people to bear children they cannot take care of. It will not infringe upon the right of a person to have access to a safe and legal medical procedure.
If politicians want to restrict abortion but are unwilling 
to support policies that will reduce unintended pregnancies or programs that will help the affected families survive, they 
have no business discussing the matter further.

Do you remember, as children, the 
many times that we were scolded for something we did? Remember when 
we would point something out that our brother, sister or classmate did to try and ex-
cuse our actions or at least redirect the scold-
ing? Well that juvenile failure to confront the truth is still happening. More recently how-ever, it has made appearances in discussions on FOX, CNN and at dinner tables across the country.
News commentators, political contribu-
tors, friends, family, ﬂ  oormates and even my fellow riders on the 118 bus route have been 
discussing the use of force in the Michael 
Brown case. Every conversation seems to start with the acceptance that it doesn’t matter what happened that afternoon, an unarmed black man should not have been shot six times. Before actual prog-ress is made, however, the con-versation often shifts from police brutality against unarmed black 
men to black-on-black crime.
I’ve heard, “Why isn’t Al Sharpton in Chi-
cago, the black-on-black murder capital of the 
country?” I’ve endured, “If all lives matter, blacks need to stop killing blacks.” Perhaps the most difﬁ  cult for me to handle is repeat-edly being informed of statistics involving black-on-black homicide.
Black-on-black crime is indeed a serious 
concern, but this is not the time to bring it up. When we as a society are trying to make progress regarding excessive force on un-armed individuals, highlighting issues with-in the culture of that individual’s race is detrimental to the process of discovering solutions.
First of all, black-on-black 
crime does not justify the killing 
of an unarmed black man by a 
white police ofﬁ  cer. 
Yes, black people do kill other black peo-
ple, and whites kill whites, and Hispanics kill 
Hispanics, but that doesn’t validate the killing of an unarmed individual by a law enforce-ment ofﬁ  cer. Furthermore, slipping in black-on-black crime statistics is indirectly excusing the murder of young unarmed black men by 
police ofﬁ  cers — something that is absolutely 
unjustiﬁ  able.
Secondly, Michael Brown’s case, as well 
as those of all of the young black men he represents, does not even remotely relate to black-on-black crime. By bringing up black-on-black crime, focus is being diverted from police brutality. The last thing we should be doing, especially as these cases appear more 
frequently, is dividing our attention from an 
issue that needs our complete focus. Every time we lose concentration during the resolu-tion process, we are doing so at the expense of the next unarmed black man.
We cannot afford to lose members of our 
society to these avoidable escalations. Let’s leave our days of distracting from and indi-rectly excusing unjustiﬁ  able actions in our 
childhood. Let’s work together with undivid-
ed attention and prevent another tragedy.

Speaking Out
President Barack 
Obama’s execu-tive action on im-
migration reform has sparked both gratitude 
and outrage across the 
country. To supporters, 
his address is viewed as the partial 
fulﬁ  llment of a long-overdue cam-paign promise. To protesters, his ad-dress only adds to the list of execu-tive actions that seem to overstep his presidential powers. 
Obama stated in his address that 
the actions he was taking were law-ful and with precedent.Executive 
actions on immigration reform have 
been taken 40 times by the past 11 presidents. These numbers beg the question as to why our nation hasn’t adopted comprehensive immigra-tion reform in recent years.
This question boils down to the 
fact that the issue of immigration is still a highly controversial subject. The issue of immigration crosses the borders of the social realm and en-ters that of the economic. It bridges the gap between the rich history of our nation and the mod-ern dilemmas we face as an evolving society. But, the question still stands as to whether the right 
steps have been taken in 
the past and recently to 
address the issue.
Obama’s most recent decision to 
take executive action must be exam-
ined carefully and with the utmost scrutiny. On one hand, his actions have temporarily bypassed a grid-locked Congress and may prompt more comprehensive immigration reform. On the other hand, his ex-
ecutive action follows the Republi-
can resurgence in the Congressio-nal midterm elections and leaves many asking whether he is setting the right tone for the ﬁ  nal two years of his presidency. Praise or protest, every American must be conscious 
of what Obama’s executive action 
means for our country as a whole.

A UF club will bring a taste 
of Lebanese culture to campus 
later this week.
UF’s Lebanese American 
Society is hosting its 12th an-
nual Lebanese Soiree at the 
Touchdown Terrace at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on Friday.
Georges Akiki, treasurer of 
the club, said the soiree is not just limited to Lebanese people.
“It’s a celebration of our cul-
ture and traditions,” said Akiki, a 28-year-old UF mechanical 
engineering Ph.D. candidate. 
A $10 donation from stu-
dents and a $15 donation from 
non-students is suggested at the event, which will be held from 7 to 11 p.m.
The menu includes tabouli, 
falafels, hummus, eggplant-based baba ghanoush, rice and chicken, kebabs, stuffed grape leaves and ground beef with onions and parsley.
There will be live Lebanese 
music from Wassim Kattan and 
traditional dancing, said Society 
President Peter Abrahamian.    
“We want to open up to oth-
er societies and organizations in the community,” he said.
Student Government and 
Volunteers for International Student Affairs are sponsoring the event with the Lebanese 
American Society.

Admissions officers at UF have not yet 
turned to social media accounts as a decid-
ing factor in examining potential students.
Unlike UF, an increasing number of col-
lege admissions officers are considering the public posts from social media profiles of applicants fair game.
Students looking to get into these uni-
versities are cleaning up their profiles and monitoring the content they post, according to The New York Times.
“I believe that it is wrong for a college 
to base the admissions of students on social media,” said Kristina Mannus, a 19-year-old UF public relations sophomore. “It should be based on their academics and involve-
ment in high school.”
The admissions process at UF is complet-
ed by a thorough review based on the infor-
mation provided on the application, Andrea Felder, director of freshman and internation-
al admissions, wrote in an email.
Applications are designed to provide sufficient information for the admissions of-
ficers to make an appropriate decision on an applicant.
“We do not look up students’ social me-
dia pages because we do not believe it will add to the application,” she wrote.
Given the volume of applications UF re-ceives as a public university, officers don’t have the time to take the extra step to look up students on social media, she wrote.
The practice of online searches occurs 
mostly at private liberal arts colleges, ac-cording to The New York Times.
“Unless students have strong security 
measures that block certain people from 
seeing their pages, I would still encourage 
students to be mindful of what they post on personal pages generally as the picture, 
post, thoughts, etc. may not be received well 
by others,” Felder wrote.UF does not look at applicants’ social media, admissions says

Students looking to score a 
spot in a full class next semester 
may turn to a questionable solu-tion.
When students at Emory Uni-
versity were found buying and selling spots in full classes, col-lege students around the country were not surprised.
At UF, the process is not un-
heard of, but it is a rare occur-rence.
“I don’t know anyone who’s 
done that,” said Angela Tang, a 
19-year-old UF sophomore. “I’ve 
heard about it.”
Chris Loschiavo, UF associ-
ate dean of students and director of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution, said buying and sell-ing spots in classes is not some-thing the Dean of Students Office deals with regularly.
“I’ve been here almost eight 
years, and I’ve never had that brought to my attention,” he said.
A simple search on the UF Class 
of 2017 and UF Class of 2018 Fa-
cebook pages yields posts asking 
for students to drop classes that are full, but none advertising the sale of spots. The organic chem-istry 2 lab seems to be the most popular class students need.
“I’ve heard of people saving 
them for their friends,” said Asa Eliasson, a 25-year-old UF nutri-
tion first-year graduate student. 
“I’ve never heard of buying them though.”
Some students seem unsure 
whether or not buying and sell-ing spots should be a punishable offense.
“I feel like it’s bribery to pay 
someone else to get your seat for you,” Tang said. “I don’t think it’s fair because it’s set up on a credit system, so it’s supposed to be that whoever has more credits 
gets it first, but that way it’s not 
really fair.”
Loschiavo said selling spots in 
classes is certainly a violation of the student conduct code, but the consequences for it would be de-cided on a case-by-case basis.
“We’d work with the regis-
trar’s office to give them a late 
registration time for their next 
semester,” he said. “It could be a suspension. If they were really making a lot of money, and they were making kind of a business thing, and it wasn’t just for one or two people, that might be more serious and warrant a suspen-sion, so it really would depend 
on the facts of the situation.”
Loschiavo said it is difficult 
to say what exactly the Dean of 
Students Office would do in this situation because it has never been reported.
“What we try to do is look for 
ways to repair harm,” he said. “We’d try to identify a way to make things right.”Holding seats, potential black market

SAN FRANCISCO  — The 
FBI has confirmed it is investi-
gating a recent hacking attack at Sony Pictures Entertainment, which caused major internal computer problems at the film studio last week.
Sony’s corporate email and 
other internal systems were knocked offline, according to reports by Variety and other trade publications. Sony work-ers reportedly saw a message appear on their computer screens that said “Hacked by #GOP,” which may be the ini-
tials of a group calling itself 
Guardians of Peace.
Copies of some unreleased 
Sony films such as “Still Alice,” ‘’Annie,” ‘’Mr. Turner” and “To Write Love on Her Arms” are now being distributed on unau-thorized file-sharing websites, as well as the still-in-theaters “Fury,” although a direct con-nection to the hacking hasn’t been confirmed.
Sony Pictures, which is 
based in Culver City, California, said Monday in a statement it is continuing “to work through is-sues related to what was clearly a cyber attack last week. The company has restored a num-ber of important services to ensure ongoing business con-
tinuity and is working closely 
with law enforcement officials to investigate the matter.”
Along with the FBI, Sony 
has brought in forensic experts from the Mandiant division of FireEye, a Silicon Valley cyber-security company.FBI investigating

The identity of the individual 
who called in a bomb threat to 
Gainesville High School on Nov. 
11 was discovered this week by 
Gainesville Police.
Tyree Nigel Harris, a 15-year-
old GHS student, called the front 
office using a TracFone around 
noon and said “bomb threat” to a school secretary before hanging up. Teachers, staff and about 1,900 students were evacuated while 
officers and four canines cleared 
the campus for explosives.
The following day at about 
8 a.m. the same phone number 
called the front office and told 
the secretary about another bomb threat. Gainesville Police then served a court order to Verizon 
Wireless to obtain call records for 
the phone number.
Officers then located Tyree and 
his father, Simon Peter Harris Jr. 
Initially Tyree denied that 
he made the bomb threat, GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias wrote in an email. Police then searched through Tyree’s cell 
phone and saw that he had texted 
Fredrick Days Jr. about the bomb threat. 
Days Jr. told police in an inter-
view that Tyree had talked about making a threat and thought he would not get caught because of his TracFone.
Harris has been charged with 
two counts for falsely reporting a planted bomb, a second degree felony in Florida.GHS bomb threat sus-

WASHINGTON — An 
aide to a Republican con-
gressman resigned Mon-
day after her Facebook post 
criticizing President Barack Obama’s daughters touched off a backlash.
Elizabeth Lauten, com-
munications director to Rep. Stephen Fincher of Tennes-see, said 16-year-old Malia Obama and her sister Sasha, 
13, should have shown more 
“class” at a turkey-pardoning ceremony last week at the White House.
Addressing her com-
ments directly to the Obama girls, Lauten wrote that they should “respect the part you play,” and added: “Then again your mother and father 
don’t respect their positions 
very much, or the nation for that matter, so I’m guess-ing you’re coming up a little 
short in the ‘good role model’ 
department.”
Lauten also urged the 
Obama girls to “dress like you deserve respect, not a 
spot at a bar.”
Lauten later apologized 
for the comments and de-leted the original post, which 
drew harsh criticism across social media.
Jessica Carter, chief of staff 
for Fincher, said Monday that 
Lauten resigned. Carter had no additional comment on a 
personnel matter.
White House spokesman 
Josh Earnest said he was 
surprised a congressio-nal staffer 
would use a Thanksgiv -
ing-themed event to criticize the first family, 
adding that it’s “pretty much common sense” that the first daughters should be off-lim-its to criticism.
After Lauten’s post be-
came the topic of conversa-tion on a variety of websites, she issued an apology, say-ing “many hours of prayer,” conversations with her fam-
ily and a re-reading of her 
words made her reconsider the post.
“When I first posted on Fa-
cebook I reacted to an article 
and I quickly judged the two 
young ladies in a way that I would never have wanted to be judged myself as a teen-
ager,” Lauten told The Com-
mercial Appeal of Memphis in an email. “Please know, those judgmental feelings 
truly have no place in my 
heart. Furthermore, I’d like to apologize to all of those who I have hurt and offend-
ed with my words.”GOP aide resigns

Men’s Basketball unranked
The UF men’s basketball team was not ranked in the latest AP top-
25 poll, which was released on Monday. This marks the first time the Gators were unranked since Jan. 31, 2011.Lineman Drew Sarvary done playing football
Florida offensive lineman Drew Sarvary announced on his Facebook account Monday that he will not resume his football career due to concussion-like symptoms.Mackenzie Dagostino is one example of volleyball coach Mary Wise’s successful recruiting See the story on Page 15.GRAHAM HALL
Alligator Writer @Graham311
It wasn’t the characteristi-
cally slow start the Gators have 
shown this season, and with the way Florida (5-1) played, coach Amanda Butler can only hope the 
energetic starts continue for the 
team.
For the first time this season, 
the Florida women’s basketball team started strong and didn’t let up, leading the entire way to a 73-44 win over Virginia Tech (4-3) Monday night in the O’Connell Center. 
With Butler urging the team 
to correct the lack of urgency the Gators seem to possess in the 
opening minutes, Florida opened 
the game strong and grabbed an early 10-2 lead.
From there, it was all UF. Redshirt senior Kayla Lewis 
scored 15 points for the Gators, who never trailed. 
Redshirt junior Cassie Peo-
ples found herself with the hot 
hand from downtown, as the 
5-foot-6 guard went 5-for-6 from 
the three-point range to end the 
game with 19 points.
Peoples leads the Gators with 
31 assists, showing a tendency to 
look for her teammates if the shot isn’t there.
“I haven’t been shooting too 
well from the three-point line this year, but today I got into the gym a little extra, I shot 200 (three-
point shots) before the game,” 
Peoples said. 
“That helped, it got me a little 
bit more comfortable.”It was a complete team effort 
from the Gators, who outhustled and outpositioned the Hokies consistently underneath the bas-ket. 
Facing a Virginia Tech team 
that featured eight players who were 6-foot or taller, Florida still found a way to outrebound its opponent 36-29 on the glass. 
With the Hokies often running 
a 2-3 zone, Florida consistently found itself open from long-range, and the team was able to capitalize on its opportunities. 
For the Gators, the key to get-ting open shots has been imple-menting the tactics the team has 
worked on in practice.
“We worked all week in our 
prep about getting into the mid-
dle, and I think that’s just a part of my game,” Lewis said. 
“It’s just a means of executing 
and hitting those shots.”
Despite the added height the 
Gators have this season, Butler 
was encouraged the team was able to overcome the height dis-
advantage that numerous Florida 
players faced. 
“We don’t ever look at (height) 
as how we’re going to rebound 
against them, size is way down the list of concerns,” Butler said.
Florida’s leading rebounder, 
redshirt junior Carlie Needles, had perhaps her toughest game of the season. She scored eight 
points on 2-for-5 shooting, with 
both field goals coming from long range. 
Florida’s shortest player also 
added three assists and grabbed four rebounds in the winning ef-fort.
After knocking down five 
three-pointers Friday at George-
town, Needles added two more 
to bring her career three-point total to 130 connections from be-hind the three point line.
Coming into Monday’s con-
test, Needles led the Southeast-ern Conference in three-point percentage, shooting 60.9 percent from behind the arc. 
A combination of hot shoot-
ing, smart passing and strong full-court defense was the formu-la for the Gators, who forced the Hokies into 24 turnovers. 
Virginia Tech came into the 
game averaging 16.5 turnovers per game.
But the Hokies repeatedly 
found themselves frustrated by the stifling Gators defense, with Florida getting 14 steals in what was a strong all-around defen-sive effort. 
“I think we did a good job of 
following the game plan,” But-ler said. “The things we’ve been practicing, we made those impor-
tant tonight.”

GATORS IN THE NFL

With Week 13 of NFL action in the books, 
here are some of the highlight performances 
from former Gators now playing in the big 
leagues.
Joe Haden, Cleveland Browns: Joe Ha-
den continues to be a ball-hawk.
In the Cleveland Browns’ 26-10 loss to 
the Buffalo Bills, the fifth-year NFL cor-
nerback intercepted a pass for the third straight game. 
The Browns failed to capitalize on the 
turnover, however, as they went three-and-out on the ensuing possession.
Haden also tallied a solo tackle and de-fended two other passes.
On the season, Haden — a first-round 
selection in the 2010 NFL Draft and a 2013-14 All-Pro second-team selection — has 63 
tackles, 14 defended passes and three in-
terceptions.
Jon Bostic, Chicago 
Bears: Jon Bostic has a knack for getting to the ball.
In the Chicago Bears’ 
34-17 loss to the Detroit 
Lions on Thanksgiving 
day, the second-year line-
backer logged 11 tackles, seven of which 
were solo stops. It was the most tackles Bostic recorded 
in a single game since tallying 17 against the Jets on Sept. 22.
On the year, Bostic has 52 tackles, which 
is tied for second on Chicago’s roster.
Will Hill, Baltimore Ravens: Since 
serving a six-game suspension to begin 
the season, Will Hill has slowly but surely 
found his groove. In six games this season, the strong safety has 22 tackles, three de-fended passes and an interception that he returned 44 yards for a touchdown against 
the New Orleans Saints on Nov. 24.
Other notables: Minnesota Vikings de-
fensive lineman Sharrif Floyd recorded a sack in the Vikings’ 31-13 win against the 
Carolina Panthers on Sunday. Floyd now has 4.5 sacks in his rookie season, match-ing his sack total from his three-year col-
legiate career at UF.
Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Riley 
Cooper hauled in four catches for 32 yards 
in the Eagles’ 33-10 win against the Dallas 
Cowboys on Thursday. 
After his breakout year last season, 
Cooper is third on the Eagles roster in re-
ceptions (43) and fourth in receiving yards (457) this season. 
Carlos Dunlap and Reggie Nelson com-
bined for 13 tackles and two defended passes in the Cincinnati Bengals’ 14-13 win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.Haden continues to intercept passes, Bostic racks up tackles

Some teams are made up of 
more than just talented athletes 
from around the country and the 
world. 
Some teams spend more time 
on the growth of their players 
and teamwork than on worrying 
about winning or losing. 
Some teams are more than a 
team; they’re a family.
The Florida women’s soccer 
team embodied each of those traits this season and, for those reasons, its year was a success. 
The Gators defined what it 
meant to be a team.
Florida’s season came to an 
end on Friday night in Palo Alto, California, when it lost in the quarterfinal round of the NCAA 
Tournament in penalty kicks to 
Stanford. 
It was the first time the Gators 
made it to the Elite Eight since 
2003.
Florida finished the season 
with a 17-4-2 record, going 9-2 in 
Southeastern Conference play. 
Some notable wins were on 
the road against Florida State — which is now in the Final Four — and on the road against Texas A&M, who won the SEC Cham-
pionship and is also now in the 
Final Four.
Coach Becky Burleigh said 
this year’s team was something special. 
They put in the work, did all 
the right things and genuinely enjoyed playing soccer together.
“I think the legacy that this 
team leaves is what it looks like to really love and care for each other on the field and how that affects your performance,” Bur-leigh said. “That takes a lot of trust. It 
takes a lot of sacrifice to be able to 
put your needs aside for the team, 
and this team really showed a lot of heart and fight.”
What makes a team even bet-
ter is when that heart and fight is 
mixed with talent and skill. 
Sophomore Savannah Jordan 
led the Gators this year in goals 
with 19, just three shy of her 22 
goals as a breakout freshman. 
Jordan finished the year atop 
the SEC in shots taken, shots per 
game, points, points per game, goals and goals per game. 
She also added eight assists on 
the year, a career high.
Senior Tessa Andujar also 
showed huge improvement this season at the defender position. 
Andujar was the point guard 
of the team, finishing the year with 10 assists, a team-high and tied for third best in the SEC. 
She also scored three goals 
and 16 total points in her final 
season. 
Those are all career highs for 
Andujar.
Florida had nine seniors this 
year who, in their time with the 
Gators, all contributed greatly to the success of the team. 
Andujar, Annie Bobbitt, Tay-
lor Burke, Jillian Graff, Karina 
Gutsche, Lauren Silver, Havana 
Solaun, Annie Speese and red-shirt junior Lindsey Cooper have all played their final games for Florida.
Burleigh said the leadership 
the seniors displayed this year played a huge role in the team’s success and that they leave Flor-ida by setting a new standard for 
what the Florida soccer program 
should strive for.
“I just wanted (the team) to 
understand that it was one of the 
most fulfilling years I had as a 
coach,” Burleigh said.
Burleigh added that the play-
ers who return next year and even the seniors who won’t be 
back will continue to contribute 
to the future Gator teams, so she doesn’t see this as an end.
“I think I’m just not gonna 
look at it as the end,” Burleigh said.  
“I think I’m just gonna look at 
it as the beginning.” Florida soccer embraces highlights from 2014 season

Florida coach Mary Wise is a 
volleyball legend.
She’s known for her unde-
feated records against teams like 
LSU and Ole Miss. And in 24 years, she’s built a program that is nationally ranked and has the 
potential to win a national title.
For Wise, it all comes down to 
recruiting.
Her ability to recruit the best 
athletes in the country has be-come one of Wise’s greatest 
strengths since taking over the program in 1991.
Some of the players that have 
graduated from UF’s volleyball program include Chloe Mann, a volleyball legend after she broke the Florida, Southeastern Confer-ence and NCAA record for her 
hitting efficiency; Kristy Jaeckel 
— whose accolades range from AVCA All-South Region to a 2010 Second Team All SEC pick; and 
Kelly Murphy, a World Champi-
on athlete after helping lead the U.S. to its first world champion title.
And that’s just within the last 
five years.
Wise’s reputation for strong 
recruiting goes beyond bringing in high schoolers, though. If it 
means pulling top players from 
not-so-great college programs, than that’s what’s going to be done.
“Hopefully, recruits come to 
the program because of our suc-cess,” Wise said. “I think when players transfer they’re looking for the right fit. For whatever 
reason, whether they’re transfer-
ring… it’s like you get a second chance.”                   
She was known as the “Brown-
eyed Girl.”
Not because of her actual eye 
color or her girl-next-door looks but because of her last name.
In 2012, Taylor Brauneis trans-
ferred to Florida.
Brauneis, a ninth-ranked set-
ter for assists in the country, was 
lured into the Florida program 
from an unranked Louisville team and became one of Florida’s big-gest assets within just two years.
“What Taylor did so well was 
set the middle,” Wise said. “We had a pretty good middle there. The Taylor-to-Chloe combination was one of the best in the coun-
try.”
She finished her collegiate ca-
reer with 4,735 assists over the 
duration of 447 sets. Brauneis av-eraged 11.45 assists in her senior 
season alone, a mark that ranked 
third in the SEC and 16th overall among Division I players.
Needless to say, recruit-
ing Brauneis was a big steal for Wise.
But it wasn’t the biggest.
                   
One year removed from Brau-
neis’ transfer and Mackenzie Dagostino, a major up-and-com-er, transferred onto the Florida squad.
At 5-foot-10, the dark-blonde 
hair, green-eyed setter looks pe-tite next to her teammates, who are mostly 6-foot and taller.
But her height means nothing 
since she has a 31.7-inch jump — just three inches under her 6-foot-1 teammate Shainah Jo-seph.
As the setter, she leads the team; tells them how to play and 
where to be, which is probably 
the best position for Dagostino considering how vocal she is.
Anytime a referee makes a call 
Dagostino disagrees with, she 
questions it.
She’s like a politician: She can 
deliver any message in a calm, 
collected manner with a smile 
stretched across her face.
Her happy-go-lucky demeanor 
and candor make her the perfect 
choice to lead Florida.
“Mack before the game she’s 
always like, ‘You’re going to be a beast tonight,’” teammate Carli Snyder said. “She’s so intense, 
she’s probably the most intense 
setter I’ve ever played with. She’s the first person you see after you get a kill, like pointing at you and going crazy and that’s really awe-
some to play with.”
Dagostino’s start in college 
volleyball was at Maryland in 
2011 – a Big 10 school that went 
8-12 in its conference in her lone 
year with the Terps. Splitting playing time with senior Remy McBain, Dagostino led the team in assists per set with 5.90.
Ultimately she transferred 
from Maryland to Florida be-cause she missed her family, which lives in Tampa Bay.
“We were in a fortunate situa-
tion that she just wanted to come home,” Wise said.
That, and because she was 
ready to win.
While Dagostino was a starter 
at Maryland, it didn’t mean she was in the place that would offer her the most success.
“No. 1, I wanted to be closer to 
my family,” Dagostino said. “No. 2, I wanted to play for a program that had the same mindset I did like wanting to get to the NCAA 
final tournament.”
Dagostino isn’t the only player 
to want to join the Florida squad 
because of its dominance in 
NCAA play. 
Florida’s postseason success 
has always been a major pull for 
young athletes. 
And to boast the Florida 
squads reputation, the Gators made it to its 24th consecutive NCAA Tournament on Sunday, a feat only 14 teams have accom-
plished since 1981.
“She’s making plays from the 
setters position that very few setters have ever made because of how quick she is,” Wise said. 
“She’s an elite level athlete. She’s highly competitive and can play that way.”
                   
It takes confidence to know 
you’re good enough to play for a 
program like Florida’s.
But when you’re Abby Deter-
ing, having confidence isn’t re-
ally unwarranted.
She was the 2013-14 Gatorade 
Volleyball Player of the Year.
She was MVP of the Ohio Di-
vision II State Championship game in her freshman year of 
high school.
“I came to Florida because I 
wanted to win,” Detering said. 
“I’m competitive so I wanted to go against the best teams around. 
I could have gone to a smaller 
school and been a starter, but that’s not my goal here. My goal is to win and hopefully win a 
championship in the future.”
While she waits on the bench 
for her name to be called, she 
scouts Florida’s opponents and mimics the opposing teams of-
fense for the Gators to practice 
against.
She’s an expert.She knows what the opposing 
team is going to do before it even knows it’s going to do it.
She also has an earlier start 
than Dagostino and Brauneis had with the Gators. While she’s 
only participated in eight sets, 
it’s clear Wise thinks Detering is something special.
That, maybe, she is the winner 
the team has been waiting for.
“We know the future for Abby 
is very bright,” Wise said.TUESDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Mackenzie Dagostino, who transferred to Florida in 2013, became the starter this season following 
the graduation of setter Taylor Brauneis. Dagostino, a junior, is in the top 20 in the country in assists per set (11.41) and service aces per set (0.43).

Dagostino (left) and freshman Abby Detering (right) both want to win, which is one of the reasons 
why Dagostino transferred from Maryland to Florida and why Detering opted to come to UF and sit on the bench for a year instead of starting at a smaller school.

Alligator Staff Writer @Morgan_Moriarty
With the 2014 Heisman Tro-
phy ceremony less than two 
weeks away, several hardware 
hopefuls will make their ﬁ  nal 
cases on Championship Saturday this weekend. 
Let’s take a look at who alli-
gatorSports believes has the best chance at winning the award, and preview what stands be-tween them and a trip to New York City. 
Marcus Mariota — Quar-
terback, Oregon: Marcus Mari-ota has been playing as the best, 
most consistent quarterback in 
the country all season. 
He has thrown just two in-
terceptions all season and didn’t throw his ﬁ  rst one until Week 9 
against California. 
Last week against Oregon 
State in the annual Civil War 
game, he threw four touchdowns 
and ran for another two in a 47-19 
victory. 
The Ducks get a rematch 
against Arizona in the Pac-12 Championship game this week-
end — the Wildcats gave the 
Ducks their only loss of the sea-son in early October. 
Mariota was without his two 
offensive tackles in the loss, and it was reported after the loss that he wasn’t fully healthy after be-
ing sacked seven times the week 
before. 
Mariota, now fully healthy and 
with his two tackles back, gets an opportunity to avenge that loss 
on Saturday in Levis Stadium.  Melvin Gordon — Running 
back, Wisconsin: Melvin Gordon 
is the only running back in our top ﬁ  ve for a reason. 
His numbers are nothing 
short of ridiculous — his 2,260 rush yards lead the country by a margin of greater than 200 yard, 
and he has 24 touchdowns on the 
year. 
His most impressive perfor-
mance came three weeks ago against Nebraska as he rushed 
for 408 yards on 25 carries in the 
third quarter alone. 
Last week against Minnesota, he tweaked his ankle late in the game, but reports say he should be ﬁ  ne. 
Wisconsin will face Ohio State 
in the Big Ten Championship game Saturday, which comes in with the 40th ranked rushing de-fense in the country. 
If Gordon can have a day like 
he did against Nebraska and the Badgers upset the No. 5 Buck-eyes, that could move him ahead of Mariota. 
Amari Cooper — Wide re-
ceiver, Alabama: If the Heisman Trophy weren’t traditionally giv-en to quarterbacks and running backs, Cooper would be a shoo-in for the award. 
He’s coming off of a record-
breaking game against Auburn, where he set an Iron Bowl record with 224 receiving yards in the 
Crimson Tide’s 55-44 win. 
The 224 yards also matches his 
season-high which he reached 
against Tennessee last month. He’s averaging 15 yards per re-
ception and has 14 touchdowns 
on the year. 
Cooper and the Crimson Tide will face Missouri in Atlanta for the SEC Championship on Satur-day afternoon. 
The Tigers’ secondary gives 
up over 200 yards in the air per game, but their pass rush along the defensive line could give quarterback Blake Sims some 
trouble ﬁ  nding Cooper.   
Trevone Boykin — Quarter-
back, TCU: Trevone Boykin is a 
big reason why the TCU Horned Frogs are the No. 5 team in the 
country. 
He already has over 3,000 in 
the air, and another 598 on the 
ground. 
He does have six interceptions, 
but he has not thrown more than 
one interception in a game. 
Although TCU is ranked 
ahead of No. 7 Baylor currently, their 61-58 loss to the Bears in October will allow Baylor to win the Big 12 with a win over Kansas 
State Saturday. 
Though if the Bears lose, TCU 
will win the Big 12 and could 
earn a spot in the playoff. 
TCU has to beat Iowa State on 
Saturday ﬁ  rst for that to happen, though.  
Dak Prescott — Quarter-
back, Mississippi State: A pre-vious Heisman frontrunner has dropped to the last spot in our rankings thanks to poor perfor-mances the last three weeks in 
which he’s thrown six intercep-
tions. 
The Bulldogs have dropped 
two of their last three games, 
losing to both Alabama and Ole 
Miss. Marcus Mariota, Melvin Gordon leading Heisman race
