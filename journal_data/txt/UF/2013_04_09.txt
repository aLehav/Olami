◗ THE BILL IS HEADED BY A UF ALUMNUS.

Glass and water pipes could be smoked out of stores if the 
Florida legislature passes a bill prohibiting their sale.
If Florida House of Representatives House Bill 49 becomes 
law, it would outlaw the sale of various smoking instruments 
including glass pipes and long glass water pipes — also known as bongs — statewide.
So far, the bill passed through the Criminal Justice Sub-
committee as well as the Business and Professional Regulation Subcommittee. The House’s Justice Appropriations Subcom-mittee also reviewed the bill Tuesday morning.
The bill’s Senate counterpart, Senate Bill 1140, has moved 
through the Criminal Justice Committee and, most recently, the Appropriations Subcommittee on Civil and Criminal Jus-tice on Thursday morning.
Rep. Darryl Rouson, D-St. Petersburg and sponsor of the 
House bill, said it’s common knowledge that pipes are used for drugs, not tobacco. He said he wants to make it difﬁ  cult for Legislature blazes

In his junior year of college, UF history 
senior lecturer Steve Noll was bored in his 
dorm room, thinking of fun things to do. Fast forward 40 years, and he’s pulled off arguably the biggest hoax college sports has ever seen.
During the widespread formation of All-
American teams, Noll and three friends invent-ed a team, naming the top 15 rookie players in the nation under a made-up organization, the National Association of Collegiate Basketball Writ-ers. Noll said they did it to “tweak the nose of people in power.”
They mailed certiﬁ  cates 
to the chosen players from his parents’ home in Gar-den City, N.Y., for big-city 
legitimacy. Noll sent certiﬁ  cates under the name Andrew G. Miller, the supposed secre-tary of the organization. Under this name, he also contacted the Associated Press with news of the new team, which caused it to spread to newspapers across the country.
The certiﬁ  cates stated the team was created 
in honor of the association’s made-up founder, Leo G. Hershberger, Noll said.
But the creation of the team was no joke. 
They spent hours sorting through newspapers in the library to pick the 15 players. Noll said they tried to ﬁ  nd valid candidates.
“We wanted it to be a legitimate team,” he 
said. “Not just a bunch of jokers.”The “association” received several letters 
from players’ schools thanking them. The sports information director at University of Notre Dame even requested a new certiﬁ  cate because they accidentally misspelled forward/center John Shumate’s name on the ﬁ  rst one.
A few years later, Noll and one of the 
pranksters, Reed Bohne, were traveling near Notre Dame and decided to stop in and ask the same sports information director to see the school’s All-American awards.

Carlton is coming.
Best known for playing Carlton 
Banks on “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,” Alfonso Ribeiro will be speaking on UF’s campus tonight.
In addition to his ’90s fame and infamous dance moves, Ribeiro has been a TV host, director and Broadway actor.
Hosted by the Inter-Residence 
Hall Association, Ribeiro will be speaking at 8 p.m. at the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom. 
Admission for the event is 
free.
Doors will open at 7:30 p.m.Severin Walstad, the president of IRHA, said he thought this event would be a fun way to catch up on childhood memories and ease pre-exam stress.
“We thought he would be a 
really good choice because we grew up watching him on ‘The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,’” said the 21-year-old public relations senior.
Walstad said Ribeiro will talk about how 
he got his start and reveal more about himself than what is seen on TV.
Elliot Grasso, 
IRHA auditor and president-
elect, said he was looking forward to hearing Ribeiro talk about his rise to fame.
The 20-year-old ﬁ  nance 
sophomore said Ribeiro will be paid $12,500 to speak.
Because thousands of students 
grew up watching the sitcom, Grasso said Ribeiro is someone who students will be able to relate to.
He said $2 rafﬂ  e tickets will 
be available for purchase at the door for the opportunity to meet Ribeiro. All proceeds from the rafﬂ  es will go toward Dance Marathon.

The UF Students for a Democratic 
Society and UF Libertarians are co-
hosting an anti-drone week of action to raise awareness about what they believe to be UF’s involvement in military drone research.
“UF’s engineering programs, in 
particular, get a lot of funding from defense contractors from the U.S. government to pay professors to do research in drones,” said Kelly Barber, a 21-year-old history senior and vice president of the UF Liber-tarians.
The week of events will include 
painting the 34th Street Wall, a pub-lic reading of the names of those who died in drone strikes, tabling and a protest outside of Tigert Hall, said Conor Munro, a 21-year-old his-tory and economics junior and lead organizer for SDS.
Peter Ifju, a UF mechanical and 
aerospace engineering professor, gets funding from the U.S. military to research unmanned aerial ve-hicles for investigating wildlife ref-uges owned by UF.
“Any technology, whether it’s 
drones, doing research on materials — for instance, ceramics or metals — virtually anything could be used for military purposes,” he said. “So this, just like any other technology, could be used for military purposes. No question about that.”
UF is one of 81 public entities 
authorized by the Federal Aviation Administration to use drones, ac-cording to a list released by the FAA in 2012. 
These drones are equipped with 
high resolution cameras to do re-search in uninhabited areas and re-mote wildlife sanctuaries. UF is not authorized to fly drones over cam-pus, Ifju said.
Military drones were thrust into 
the national spotlight when the Obama administration increased the use of drone strikes against enemy combatants.
UF Libertarians and SDS hope to 
seek answers about the university’s involvement with the U.S. military drone program, Munro said.
“We want to demilitarize UF,” he 
said.

Margaret Thatcher, who 
was the prime minister of 
the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990, died of a stroke Monday. 
She was 87.The Iron Lady’s  
former speechwriter John O’Sullivan was coincidentally in 
Gainesville, and he spoke about her influence on world history at the Paramount Plaza Hotel & Suites, located at 2900 SW 13th St.
“We’ve lost today one 
of the greatest peacetime prime ministers in history and one of the two or three greatest English women who ever lived,” he said.
O’Sullivan said Thatcher 
was instrumental in ending the Cold War peacefully and reviving the British spirit and economy.
When Thatcher was 
elected into office in 1979, labor strikes and inflation had made the country seem ungovernable, O’Sullivan said.
However, Thatcher 
pursued policies that strengthened the economy and allowed for the growth of enterprise that characterized the 1980s.
O’Sullivan credited 
Thatcher not only for her hard work and success, but also for her ability to foresee problems in the future.
Before she left office in 1990, O’Sullivan said, she expressed her concerns about Europe moving to a universal currency.
“If they had followed 
her advice, Europe would not be in the terrible mess that it’s currently in,” he said.
O’Sullivan spoke before 
about 50 members of the Florida Free Speech Forum.
Florida Free Speech 
Forum President Nath Doughtie said he was glad they were able to hear O’Sullivan speak.
“I thought with his 
reminisces and everything about somebody that important ... he gave a really special insight that you don’t always get in a small town like Gainesville,” he said.
Charna Cohn, a member 
of the forum, said she enjoyed O’Sullivan’s speech because it offered a different perspective on European politics.
“I think that the credit 
for remaining strong in [Thatcher’s] principles was a good takeaway lesson,” she said. Margaret Thatcher

◗ JUNE 1 AND SEPT. 1 ARE SALTWATER 
LICENSE-FREE DAYS.
BEATRICE DUPUY
Alligator Contributing Writer
People of all ages will be able to fish without a license 
on days specified by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Con-
servation Commission.
The commission has designated June 1 and Sept. 1 as 
a saltwater license-free fishing day and June 8 as fresh-water day. The last freshwater license-free day was April 6.
Licenses are typically required for freshwater and 
saltwater fishing. Children under the age of 16 are nor-mally not required to have a license.
Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission spokeswoman 
Amanda Nalley said the designated days are meant to promote fishing to residents and fishing enthusiasts.
“What these days do is they offer an opportunity for 
people who may not have a fishing license currently to get out on the water and experience Florida fishing,” she said.Nalley said the days are planned close to holidays 
and on weekends to make them available to as many people as possible. The days are also planned around recreational fishing seasons and recreational harvests.
She said recreational harvest for spiny lobster and 
bay scallops will also be open Sept. 1.         
Gary Simpson, manager at Gary’s Tackle Box, 5721 
NW 13th St., said license-free days have encouraged cus-tomers in the past to get fishing licenses.
“This particular store, we might reach three to 
four people that will fish due to that opportunity, that wouldn’t have fished otherwise,” he said.
Local fisherman Cole Childers, 58, who has a lifetime 
fishing license, said fishing is a great way to get children outside and enjoy outdoor activities.
“My dad called it hydrotherapy. Just being around 
the water made me forget about everything and just re-lax and have fun,” he said. “It makes you feel like you’re a kid again.”Florida license-free fishing days to begin“We’ve lost today

Noll said he and his friends 
were afraid of being found out.“Today, people would 
Google it and say ‘There’s no such thing as that,’” Noll said.
Leon Douglas said he was 
excited when he received the award in 1973 as a freshman at the University of Alabama. Though he had never heard of the award, he thought it was real. He was the only player who was told it was fake. He said he has no hard feelings.
“There’s no significance to the 
award, but here we are talking about it,” Douglas said. “That’s significant enough for me.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, APRIL 9, 2013

BroBible, founded in 2009 as 
an online destination for every-
thing “bro,” recently ranked UF as No. 2 on its “50 Best Party Schools in the U.S.” list.
West Virginia University 
ranked No. 1.
Although some might worry 
that reviews such as this give the university a bad reputation, UF student Elizabeth Udell doesn’t think so.
“It balances it out in the public eye that we get things done but aren’t completely boring,” said the 22-year-old public relations senior and member of Kappa Delta sorority.
Tara Vozzola, a 20-year-old 
public relations junior, said it will make UF more appealing to prospective students.
“By being ranked the No. 2 
party school, it shows that UF students are outgoing,” Vozzola  said. “And it will not be hard to fit in and make new friends if you decide to come to school here.”
On its website, BroBible claims that other party school rankings are flawed because they never provide clear-cut criteria for how they rank the schools. 
To fix this, BroBible created 
what it calls the BroBible Party School Index, which focuses on the reputations of the colleges over the last 10 years.
The formula involves giving 
weight to colleges based on past ratings, sports and the editor’s opinions, according to the Bro-Bible website.
Greg Liuzzo, a 21-year-old ar-
chitecture junior and member of Pi Kappa Phi fraternity, said this ranking makes him proud to go to UF.“If UF isn’t the No. 2 best par-
ty school in America, it should be No. 1,” he said.

◗ HE WAS A DENTAL CONSULTANT FOR THE 
UNIVERSITY ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION.
KATHRYN VARN
Alligator Staff Writer
A local dentist who owned his own practice and 
served as a University Athletic Association dental 
consultant died early Friday after his car caught fire in a Gainesville driveway.
Thomas Joseph Weber, 44, of Gainesville, was 
pronounced dead on the scene by Alachua County Fire Rescue officials after his car caught fire in the front yard of his parent’s house, located at 7205 NW 47th Court, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.
At about 1 a.m. Friday, FHP reported that Weber 
was driving his 1998 Acura “erratically” before he crashed into the driveway of the house, hitting a parked car and the garage door.
He then hit a tree stump, causing his car to catch 
fire, and couldn’t get out before it was engulfed in flames.
Weber owned a dental practice on Northwest 
41st Street. According to his practice’s website, Weber had a wife and three children. He grew up in Gainesville and earned his doctor of dental medicine from UF’s College of Dentistry in 1995.  
For about 10 years, Weber served as a dental 
consultant for the UAA, said John Barrett, assistant director of sports health and athletic trainer for UF’s women’s basketball team.
Barrett said Weber will be missed as a dentist 
and as a friend.
Even when Weber’s office was closed, Barrett 
said Weber would always come in to help an athlete.
On several occasions, Weber attended pre-
participation physicals on his own time to help mold mouthpieces for athletes, Barrett said.
“When we needed something, he was literally 
a phone call away,” Barrett said. “He went above and beyond for the well-being of the athlete.”
Emily Weber LeBrun, Weber’s sister, said she 
and her family were touched by the community support after her brother’s death.
“I’m just so privileged to know what kind of an 
impact he had on people every day,” she said.
Although FHP hasn’t released more information 
about the crash, FHP Sgt. Tracy Hisler-Pace said investigators are working to find out what happened.
“It’s just so tragic,” she said. “The entire 
situation is being investigated, so I’m sure they’ll try and answer some of the questions [the family] has.”

NOLL , from page 1One athlete was toldThe bill could hurt local businesses
drug users to buy the pipes.
“Some people criticize me be-
cause they say that this will not 
eradicate illegal drug usage,” he said. “My motives are to create one more impediment or obstacle to in-gesting illegal drugs.”
Rouson said he was a drug ad-
dict while he attended UF’s Levin College of Law. In fact, he said, he was introduced to cocaine during exam time.
“When I got to Gainesville, the 
whole world opened up,” he said. “For me, [the bill is] both personal and professional.”
In 2010, Rouson sponsored a bill 
that allowed retailers to sell glass and water pipes under the condi-tion that at least 75 percent of the store’s revenue comes from tobacco products. Since the bill’s passing, it has regulated the sale of glass pipes and bongs. HB 49 would change the regulation to a ban.
For local tobacco and gift shops, the new bill could hurt business.
Michael Aiello, an owner of 
Land B4 Time Smoke Shop Inc. in downtown Gainesville, said 65 to 70 percent of the shop’s products are glass and water pipes.
“It would hurt,” he said. “If it 
didn’t shut us down, we’d sure 
enough be strug-gling.”
Another local 
tobacco and gift shop employee, who preferred to remain anony-mous, said the 
shop she works in could survive by selling other products. Most of her customers come to buy tobacco pipes.
Local defense attorney Craig 
DeThomasis has represented nu-merous tobacco and gift shops when similar legislative changes have happened. DeThomasis said he believes Florida is regressing as a state because prohibition has been proven to be ineffective public policy. It increases unemployment, decreases the tax base and opens up a new black market, he said.
In his 30-year career as a de-
fense attorney, DeThomasis said he’s seen attempts to declare cer-tain items illegal, but the latest bill is the broadest piece of legislation to “shut down what is otherwise a legitimate retail business opera-tion.”
Gainesville Rep. Keith Perry 
said he supports the bill, adding public policy should be based off what’s best for the general public, not off an individual’s livelihood.
For Rouson, the bill isn’t about 
unemployment or a reduced tax base. Instead, he said, it’s about shutting down an operation that fa-cilitated his drug problem and pre-venting addictions in the future.
“It’s about life and death,” he 
said. “It’s about recovery. It’s about addictions.”

The doors of a redesigned Sports 
Authority in northwest Gainesville 
swung open Saturday after two months of remodeling.
The store, located at 7400 W. 
Newberry Road, features a new layout with specialty sport shops, new flooring and new light fix-tures.  
Saturday’s grand reopening of 
the 42,000-square-foot store was complete with prizes and a guest appearance from Matt Elam, a for-mer UF Gators safety.
Ben Repp, co-manager of the 
store, estimated more than 500 people attended the opening.
“I think the crowd response 
was very good,” he said. “We had activities in the store, we gave out gift cards every hour, gave away a signed Tim Tebow football and handed out a $500 shopping spree.”  
The main goal of remodeling the 
store was to create an open floor plan to have more space for cus-tomers and products, Repp said.
The new layout includes spe-
cialty sports shops within the store, including an area for primarily UF apparel.
“There’s more space and it 
draws people to these areas, so it’s a nice big assortment of everything you need,” Repp said.
Patty Jimenez, a company 
spokeswoman, said customers can expect a better shopping experi-ence because of the new layout.
“It makes it easier because it en-
hances customer service within the store,” she said. “It’s redesigned to make shopping simple and fast while still providing all the proper sporting goods to the Gainesville community.”Sports Authority on

Vranish believes he was fired after Villamil heard he considered being former UF Student Body President Ben Meyers’ campaign manager, if Meyers decid-ed to run in the Spring 2013 SG elections.
Ryan Gilbert, who represented Villamil, 
argued Villamil was within his power to fire Vranish for not doing his job. 
Acting Supreme Court Chief Justice Tim Mason explained that ac-cording to the Constitu-tion, the president has the authority to remove officers of executive departments at his discretion to the ex-
tent that he complies with nondiscrimination require-ments.
“The way that the constitution is drafted, 
it doesn’t seem to provide a restriction on the president’s removal authority,” he said.The court deadlocked over the constitu-
tionality of the Governmental Boards, Com-missions and Subsidiary Organizations codes and how they may contradict the UF Constitu-tion, and the basis of why Vranish was fired at its first meeting Feb. 24. 
“I could have had a fair hearing in the im-
peachment, but if the president has utter say it makes it almost impossible for a student to protect themselves,” Vranish said, according to meeting minutes.

Do it like a lady: drag queens and fans
Well, spring has rolled around again, and for me, 
that means only one thing: I get to see colorfully dressed man-ladies strut their stuff up and down 
the catwalk in the Reitz Union Ballroom.
UF Pride Awareness Month’s drag show is Wednesday, 
hosted in honor of Pride Awareness Month for the LGBT community.
This might win understatement of the year because what 
better way to make someone aware of pride culture than with 6-foot men in gowns, 7-inch heels and hairdos to the roof? Try letting that go unnoticed on your radar.
Headliners for the show are former contestants from 
“RuPaul’s Drag Race,” which is a TV show that stormed in with padded hips sashaying and wigs a-blowing and stole my heart. Hosted by the fabulous RuPaul, the show selects drag queens to compete for the title of “America’s next drag superstar,” and each week, the contestants have to compete in challenges and walk the runway in gloriously over-the-top costumes.
It’s just like “America’s Next Top Model,” but better in 
every single way.
It takes all the fun of reality competition shows and ramps 
up the camp factor by a thousand. I thoroughly applaud whatever producer in Los Angeles got behind this idea.
From what I have noticed, most of RuPaul’s fans are 
women and people within the LGBT community, which I found a bit bafﬂ  ing at ﬁ  rst.
Why would women, most of whom aren’t gay, really 
enjoy watching a show about drag queens? What’s the ap-peal?
Drag queens are men who looked at the world of wom-
anhood and got to pick and choose which parts they wanted to keep.  
Glamorous ball gowns and slinky mini dresses? Check. 
Sky-high heels? Double check. Dramatic hair and makeup? Nailed it. Catty back talk and sassy put-downs but also shared feelings of sisterhood? Of course.
These men live out this dressed-to-the-nines fantasy not 
just in clubs or on girl’s nights out, but every single weekday — for a living. What girl wouldn’t be a little jealous of that? It would be like prom night and ka-raoke at the club rolled together, and you could get paid for it.
As a girl who wobbles in heels, 
is inept in makeup and owns a severely limited wardrobe of T-shirts, I watch these queens with mixed feelings of awe, admiration and inferiority because they look like they are having more fun as 
gals during a two-hour show than I have on a daily basis of being one.
Drag queens, for me, always remind me of a quote from 
the play “M. Butterﬂ  y” in which a character explains, “Why, in the Peking Opera, are women’s roles played by men? Be-cause only a man knows how a woman is supposed to act.”
It hits a paradox where most women wish their lives 
looked a little bit more like the lives men have impersonat-ing them.
Watching “RuPaul,” I’m looking at women through the 
perspective of men trying to be women, and at some point, I am not sure which one is looking to the other for inspira-tion.
Drag queens look to women as the models and inspiration 
for their work, and women look to drag queens as hope that a life that fabulous and glittery can exist in the real world.
Sometimes drag gets criticized for perpetuating exagger-
ated stereotypes about women, the LGBT community and especially transgendered women, but I think drag teaches women and the LGBT community some important lessons.
Mainly, remember to not always take yourself so seri-
ously, but to always be proud of who you are and what you do — and to be ﬁ  erce and fabulous as hell while you’re do-ing it.
As the always lovely RuPaul once said, “We all came into 
this world naked. The rest is all drag.”
Amen. Enjoy the show tomorrow.

Stop snacking while 
watching TV shows
Have you ever sat in front of the TV and not paid attention 
to what was happening on the screen? That’s apparently healthier for you than the alternative: caring.
“There is something unique about television and something 
unique about being engaged with television,” said lead research-er David Bickham, a research scientist at the Center on Media and Child Health at Children’s Hospital Boston, according to a US News article.
“The amount of attention that young people pay to television 
is a key link between media use and issues with weight,” contin-ued Bickham, who also is an instructor in pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.
“All screen time is not the same,” said Dr. Michael Rich of 
Children’s Hospital’s Center for Media and Child Health, ac-cording to a report by the Boston Herald. “With video games and the computer, your hands are busy, there’s less advertis-ing.... TV sets up an environment where food consumption is easy. Television is ﬁ  nancially supported by advertising, and that advertising is almost never for broccoli.”
This is why snack food companies do so well, because those 
types of food go so well with watching TV for hours. They go even better with shows that you are actively excited to watch.
Think about it. People have entire watch parties for TV shows, 
complete with a whole spread of themed foods and snacks.
Even simpler than that, though, is just sitting down with a 
meal to watch TV. It’s connected in our brains to be fed while we’re entertained. (Looking at you, sports stadiums.)
So even when we don’t have an actual meal to eat at a nor-
mal meal hour, it’s still natural for us to grab something to just munch on in order to pass the time.
“If you’re engaged with the TV, you’re not paying attention 
to the food you’re eating, or the cues that your body is giving,” said Bickham, according to the report from the Boston Herald.
This is a problem that’s both on us, as humans and as con-
sumers, and the advertisers who constantly shove unhealthy foods in front of our faces.
We do think there has been certain strides made lately in ad-
vertising products that are better for your health, but most of us probably ignore them.
Doesn’t “healthy” give you a mental image of “it tastes bad, 
so I hate it?” That’s because advertising companies know it’s way easier to sell us the good-tasting, terrible-for-you products. We’re dumb and impressionable, and we like to eat any kind of snack possible.
Who knew caring about a TV show, however, was also going 
to be a part of our downfall?
“This study ... suggests that TV is the particular culprit. Fur-
ther, just having a TV on in the background isn’t the problem — the problem is actually watching the TV,” said Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center, ac-cording to the article by US News.
The study these scientists are referring to was taken from 
data of 13- to 15-year-olds, so the damage has already been done to our hopeless bodies.

Supreme Court should stand on the right side 
of history
Last week, the Supreme Court heard argu-
ments on two marriage equality laws: the Defense 
of Marriage Act and California’s Proposition 8. Decisions will not be released for several weeks, but the cases show the direction our country is heading.
The White House filed amicus briefs support-
ing marriage equality, and President Obama is the first sitting president to support the cause. In addition, Ted Olson, a conservative legal icon, was the principal attorney that argued against the marriage equality ban in California.
Meanwhile, public opinion on the issue has 
changed rapidly since California passed Proposi-tion 8. Support for marriage equality is at a high.   In the 18 to 32 age bracket, it is now 70 percent — up from 51 percent 10 years ago. Nine states now allow same-sex couples to marry, and sev-eral others have pending measures. Of Democrats in the Senate, only six have not declared support for marriage equality. The momentum is heading in one direction, and the issue strikes at the core debates over civil rights that have defined our na-tion’s history.
Marriage equality will happen in the United 
States, and sooner rather than later. Throughout the centuries, we have fought to expand rights for people regardless of the color of their skin, which God they pray to or their gender, and now we must fight to include people regardless of who they love as well. This is the civil rights issue of our time.
Whether the Supreme Court stands on the right 
side of history or whether it stands in its way is a decision that we eagerly await. If the court de-clines to take up this historic moment, it risks be-ing left on the sidelines as Americans do what we have done for centuries: utilize democratic means to create a more inclusive society and hence a more perfect union.
Alessandro Bordoli
UF alumnus, Class of 2012Letter to the Editor
All sorts of things pop into one’s mind when the 
words “BDSM,” “slave,” “master,” “masochist” and “sadist” are thrown around. Throughout the 
last 20 years or so, perceptions of BDSM have changed in mainstream consciousness, arguably for the better.
However, as with most mainstream perceptions, the 
public’s view of BDSM is distilled down to stereotypes and the simplest icons to make consumption a quick affair. This has allowed BDSM out of the closet and allowed it to be considered among normal sexual activities, no longer just the dark and deviant.  
The problem with mainstreaming BDSM is it not only 
leaves out much of the intricacies of its power-play relation-ships but, in many cases, it tries to mold it into normative sexuality. I am holding out hope that this too shall pass, and BDSM will be considered on its own merit without having to wrap it back up in something the vanillas can feel good about.
Think about it: Rihanna’s song “S&M,” “50 Shades of 
Grey,” “9 ½ Weeks,” “Secretary,” “Exit to Eden,” countless references in primetime shows such as “Law and Order,” “CSI,” “Family Guy,” etc. all make mention of BDSM prac-tices.
Go ahead and laugh — I do, a lot. But when you are 
done, take another look at what those high-exposure, spot-light-bright-as-the-sun media darlings say about the BDSM culture and the people within it.
When was the last time you smirked while watching a 
popular show because a wit of kink was introduced — a month ago, last week or even last night? Do you fit into any of those references? For the most part, I don’t. But I still en-joy them, and, by all means, you should, too.
Of course, I also urge you to consider researching alter-
native lifestyles. It may sound simple to just say stereotypes don’t cover such a complex portion of human sexuality, and many may be wrong. On an intellectual level, most of us know this, but we are still victims of allowing stereotypes to invade our minds.
When we are asked what a dominatrix is, don’t most 
of us think of the leather-clad, spike heel-wearing, whip-cracking, stern Queen Bitch who commands with a snarl you lick her boots?
Really? Although that is one persona in the BDSM 
world, it is certainly not mine. How about the perceptions of a Master or Dom?
The most common image is of a powerful male sexually 
and physically exerting complete control over the will and body of a submissive female.For the most part, this rings true. 
But it leaves out the how and why of it.
Also, many people believe the 
dominance is founded on violence, power and sexual inequalities, and 
the female is subjugated as no more than a vessel of plea-sure for the dominant man. In most BDSM relationships, mine included, this is a far cry from the truth and, most im-portant, what does this say about the woman? What about the man?
There are many misperceptions concerning BDSM and 
relationships. I cannot speak to all of them, but I can shine some light on the ones I am most intimately acquainted with.
To start, yes, you can have a healthy, loving relationship 
while causing and receiving pain. Yes, you can submit your body and will to another and not only enjoy it but remain your own person as well.
Just because pain gives you pleasure, does not mean you 
like all pain — stubbing your toe still hurts.
Not all Dom men want to abuse women. Not all female 
Dommes are scornful bitches. Not all submissive women are weak, meek and easy to abuse. Not all submissive men are gay. You don’t have to choose one role at all. You can like to give and receive pain with both sexes, like I do.
If this sounds trite, well, then good, because it’s meant 
to.
Most people who live this lifestyle consider this arbi-
trary, but you know what? We remind everyone about it because we know better than most people what public mis-conceptions can do.
Sadism and masochism are listed as mental diseases, and 
although it’s not common practice to lock us up anymore, the fact that it is still listed is enough to cause worry.
So really, love it up, spank each other, tie each other up, 
invite more than just two at a time to play — as long as it is all about loving and, most important, it’s consensual.
Just look around; I know plenty of places to get your 
freak on — many in our friendly local community.
Open your eyes, open your mind and prepare to not be 
surprised at all but to discover another side to yourself and your community you already knew was there.
If nothing else, you will have more to smirk about the 
next time you catch a BDSM reference on a mainstream show.

Dylan Siegel loves chocolate bars and helping a friend 
in need.
At just 6 years old, the California native published 
a book to raise money to find a cure for his friend Jonah 
Pournazarian, who was diagnosed with glycogen storage disease type 1B, a rare liver condition that can leave a pa-tient vulnerable to life-threatening diseases.
Jonah, 7, travels across the country from California to 
get treatment at Shands at UF, which is home to the largest glycogen storage disease center in the world.
Jonah and Dylan became friends in preschool. As Dylan 
got older, he told his mother, Debra Siegel, he wanted to do something to help his friend.
His mother suggested a lemonade stand or a bake sale. 
But Dylan wanted to write a book.
Dylan wrote and illustrated “Chocolate Bar.” The book 
features various things he likes.“‘That’s so chocolate bar’ is code for ‘that’s so awe-
some,’” Siegel, 37, explained.
Since the self-published book was released in Novem-
ber, about 5,000 copies have been sold and about $175,000 have been raised to find a cure. Dylan hosted a book sign-ing at a local Barnes & Noble to involve the community in his goal to find a cure.
Dr. David Weinstein, director of the Glycogen Storage 
Disease Program at Shands at UF, said he was grateful that Dylan’s book raises awareness about the disease.
“The money was incredible, but also the publicity for 
this rare condition is also something that’s invaluable,” he said.
Weinstein said the funding has expanded the research 
team.
Jonah’s father, Rabin Pournazarian, 42, said he is grate-
ful for Dylan’s efforts to find a cure for his son.
“To have this opportunity, where a 6-year-old has done 
such an incredible good deed to help raise awareness and raise funds for Dr. Weinstein and the program at Shands, has really been moving,” he said.

In the second debate before the 
April 16 Gainesville mayoral runoff 
election, Ed Braddy was the only candidate present.
The Alachua County Black Dem-
ocratic Caucus hosted the forum at the Alachua County Administration Building. About 30 people attended, but Mayor Craig Lowe was absent.
Lowe couldn’t participate be-
cause of a fundraising event sched-uled before Monday’s forum was announced, said Lowe’s campaign manager Nick Mildebrath.
Lowe also missed the Feb. 11 
Democratic Black Caucus debate be-cause of a family emergency.
“It’s amazing to me that you 
have a mayor that wants to run this city … and he disrespects all of the African-Americans and other voters that we represent,” said forum co-moderator Charles Goston.
Without an opponent in the de-
bate, Braddy answered questions from Goston about transportation, the biomass plant and leadership.
Braddy said he believes a pro-
posed lane reduction on Northwest Eighth Avenue is a bad idea.
He also discussed his support 
for the city to back out of its current biomass contract with Gainesville Renewable Energy Center.
Regarding his leadership style, 
Braddy said he would allow resi-dents more time to voice their 
concerns at City 
C o m m i s s i o n meetings.
“I believe 
strongly in our representative system of gov-ernment,” he said. “You have to make sure the 
people are in charge of the govern-ment.”
Goston said Lowe’s second ab-
sence at the Democratic Black Cau-cus could hurt his campaign.
“Tonight was the opportunity to 
let black voters know that we can no longer allow this 2 percent ... to con-trol and select the people that repre-sent us,” he said.
The next forum will be at 7 p.m. 
today at Oaks Hammock, located at 5100 SW 25th Blvd. Mildebrath said Lowe is expected to attend.Lowe absent at second forum in runoff election for mayor

Lilly Pulitzer Rousseau, the famed fashion icon who used 
a juice stand uniform to start her Floridian fashion empire in 
the early 1960s, died Sunday in West Palm Beach. She was 81.
Pulitzer’s line includes dresses, shoes and jewelry. Her line 
is popular among college women, especially at UF.
Gracie Carryl, an 18-year-old UF family, youth and com-
munity sciences freshman, remembers meeting Pulitzer in 2004 with her family.
She said she will remember Pulitzer for her kindness and 
generosity.
“She was such a genuine person,” Carryl said. “It’s sad to 
see such a legend go, but she probably lived one of the best lives of anyone.”
Susan Hines, owner of The Colorful Gator, 13005 SW First 
Road in Newberry, which offers Pulitzer’s line, said she was sad to hear of the icon’s passing but knows the company will keep her spirit alive.
“The one thing we love about Lilly is the slogan, ‘Lead a 
colorful life,’” Hines said. “Bright colors make people happy, and we love that she was a pioneer.”
Lauren Gonzalez, a 22-year-old UF journalism senior and 
former sales associate and social media manager at The Color-ful Gator, said Pulitzer’s legacy is more than a clothing label.
“I think it’s gotten a reputation for being childlike, colorful 
and very Palm Beach, but I think there’s a lot more to it than that,” she said. “It’s about expressing yourself and a love for life and not taking yourself too seriously.”
Pulitzer’s transition from a couple of juice-stained dresses 
to a self-titled clothing line inspired Gonzalez to pursue a ca-reer in fashion.
“I think she’s a great role model for women and any de-
signer who wants to be an entrepreneur and start a business,” she said.Colorful life of Lilly

A UF alumna living in South Ko-
rea said she feels safe despite North 
Korea’s recent threats of nuclear war.
After graduating from UF last 
Spring with a degree in art history and a minor in classics, Carolina Chavez decided to teach English in South Korea.
However, after living in the 
country for almost a year, Chavez, 22, said life in South Korea after the recent threats is normal.
“We’re obviously cautious, but 
the country is not in a state of emer-gency,” she wrote in an email.
Chavez said she registered with 
the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, so she will be informed of any evacuation plans or safety concerns.
However, she said she feels the threats are attempts by North Ko-rea’s new leader, Kim Jong-un, to prove himself to his country.
Zachary Selden, a UF assis-
tant professor of political science, agreed, saying the threats are more dangerous than before because North Korea is refusing to recog-nize the cease-fire armistice that ended the Korean War in the 1950s.
“This is probably one of the least 
transparent regimes on Earth,” he said. “It’s very hard to understand what goes on inside North Korea.”
Selden said Kim Jong-un might be trying to test South Korea’s new president and Japan’s new prime minister.
He added the most important 
thing for the U.S. to do is to dem-onstrate to its allies in Asia that its commitment to them is real and to help keep South Korean, Japanese and American citizens like Chavez safe.
“That’s why we’re bolstering 
our presence in South Korea,” he said. “It’s a way of telling South Korea and Japan that we have your back.”
Despite the possibility of conflict 
looming, Chavez said she will con-tinue living and working in South Korea.
“I was aware of the ever present 
tension between [North] Korea and [South] Korea,” she said. “My safe-ty being in danger wasn’t a concern for me.”

A first-of-its-kind report gave UF a 
“D” Thursday for its innovation, em-
powerment and access for global health impact. Out of 54 universities ranked, UF placed 50th.
Universities Allied for Essential 
Medicines, an organization comprised of student chapters from around the world, gave out the grade. The University Glob-al Health Impact report card was created to assess social responsibility when it comes to research and its commercializa-tion at universities.
Sandy Chiu, a 27-year-old UF second 
year law student, is trying to re-establish the UF chapter of the organization, which disappeared in 2009.
“At our university, we have the poten-
tial to shape and impact the world,” she said. “But we are limiting ourselves.”
Chiu said she believes making UF’s innovations accessible to high-, middle- and low-income countries is possible and profitable, but “it will take some ex-tra work.”
Jeffrey Keaffaber, a retiring UF chem-
istry lecturer and undergraduate coordi-nator, said he hopes to see more global accessibility for innovations from uni-versities.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said 
the university has room for improve-
ment, but it is in good company.TUESDAY, APRIL 9, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Bread of the Mighty Food Bank needs 
Gainesville’s help to stay strong in the fight 
against child hunger. The nonprofit is partici-pating in Walmart’s national Fighting Hunger Together campaign for the chance to win part of a $3 million grant.
The public can vote online once a day. More 
than 300 organizations are participating in the campaign, which is a partnership between Walmart and Feeding America, according to a press release.
Former director of the food bank Anne 
Voyles said child hunger is a major concern in Alachua County that has only been getting worse with the economic situation nation-wide.
“Often kids come to school without a full 
tummy and leave without one,” she said. “One in 5 children in Alachua County are hungry. It’s a really scary thing.”
To vote, Facebook users can go to  www.
facebook.com/walmart, click on the “Fighting Hunger” link, search for Bread of the Mighty Food Bank and download the voting app.
Voting is open until April 30.  Bread of 
the Mighty development coordinator Debie Talbot said Walmart will then give 40 grants worth $45,000 each to food banks receiving the most votes. The company will also give out 60 grants worth $20,000 to food agencies, Talbot said.
Voyles said Bread of the Mighty serves 
about 150 food agencies.
As of press time, about 85,000 votes had 
been submitted. Bread of the Mighty had more than 170 votes.
Joe Manasco, director of children nutrition 
programs for the food bank, said the organi-zation plans to use the funds to feed children through the Feeding Children in the Gap pro-gram.
“There are government funds and grants 
for feeding children, but there are pockets of poverty I can’t get to,” he said.
Talbot explained the grant will allow the 
food bank to provide meals in after-school programs, summer programs, community centers and rural communities. In 2012, the organization distributed more than 5 million pounds of food in Alachua, Dixie, Gilchrist, Lafayette and Levy counties, she said.
“When you see somebody crying because 
they haven’t had meat and vegetables at the same time in a long time,” she said, “you real-ize how critical this is.”

just ask John Brantley.
But on a team that lost tal-
ent across the board, Sturgis could prove to be near the 
top of the list in terms of the Gators’ biggest loss.
Junior quarterback Jeff 
Driskel made a salient point on Saturday. While speaking about Florida’s offense, he talked about how “it is hard to just put drives together consistently” and about the necessity to develop an of-fense with quick-strike capa-bilities.
He is correct.Connecting on throws 
down field and hitting big plays makes scoring much easier. Last year’s team did not have that capability. It re-mains to be seen if this squad does.
But Sturgis showed his true 
value when Florida’s offense became stagnant and stalled. That is when he did his job better than anyone else in the country.
Sturgis was 3 for 3 on at-
tempts from 50 yards or lon-ger last season. He was 24 of 28 overall.
Florida’s approach to win-
ning games en route to a Sugar Bowl appearance was strong defense, great special teams and an offense that grinded out just enough points to win.
I don’t foresee that plan 
changing much next season.
But if Phillips or Hardin — 
or even walk-on Frank Velez, who was apparently thrown into the mix during spring — can’t become consistent enough to continue the plan, the entire team will suffer.
Then Muschamp won’t 
be the only one experiencing nightmares.

Hall of Fame baseball manager Earl Weav-
er’s philosophy for winning was “pitching, 
defense and the three-run homer.” Against Mississippi State this weekend, Florida fol-lowed the same strategy.
The No. 3 Gators (38-4, 12-3 Southeastern 
Conference) hit five homers in the past three games, constituting 16 of Florida’s 18 runs.
“I’ve been coaching for a long time, and 
that’s our style,” coach Tim Walton said. 
But that style showed its faults in the 
Gators’ 6-5 loss to the Bulldogs on Sunday.After falling behind early, Florida scram-
bled to come back from an early 5-0 deficit. The Gators drew a walk and hit two singles to load the bases for catcher Taylore Fuller, who hit her first career grand slam. 
But after Fuller’s home run, UF struggled 
to get hits in key situations. Alison Owen came in to pitch for MSU after the second inning and shut down Florida’s offense. 
Throughout the season, UF has relied on 
walks to get rallies started. But Owen show-cased her control, walking only one batter. Without the luxury of free passes, Florida’s of-fense struggled. The only hit a Florida batter managed off Owen was a solo home run by senior Kelsey Horton.
“I don’t think we really 
had the opportunity to play a whole lot of small ball,” Walton said. 
The Gators currently 
lead the SEC in walks but rank 10th in batting aver-age. They are third in home 
runs. But on Sunday, Florida could not hit its way back into the lead.
Florida’s home-run hitting was consistent 
against MSU. UF hit two homers on Friday, one on Saturday and two on Sunday. The dif-ference was the number of runners on base. On Friday, the Gators hit two singles be-
fore Horton hit a three-run homer. Florida then reloaded the bases with three walks be-fore Stephanie Tofft hit a grand slam.
UF scored all of its Saturday runs on a Jes-
sica Damico grand slam.
But in the series finale, after Fuller hit a 
grand slam, the Gators could not get runners on base, and Horton’s second homer of the se-ries came with the bases empty.
“My players buy into the fact that we get 21 
outs; how we choose to use those 21 outs is up to us,” Walton said.

Florida’s offensive style limits rally opportunities in loss
prise this season after coming back from 
open-heart surgery early and finishing near the top for Florida in all of his tour-naments.  
“I do think we’re getting healthier,” 
Alexander said. 
Sophomore J.D. Tom-
linson also saw his score drop from the first round to the second round. 
Tomlinson shot a 74 (+2) in the first round but brought his score down to a 71 (-1) in the second round to tie Banks for 25th. 
The biggest improvement for Florida 
was senior captain Tyler McCumber, who improved eight strokes from his first round 77 (+5) to a 69 (-3) in the sec-ond round to tie for 29th.
After three top-10 finishes in the fall, 
McCumber’s best finish this spring was 24th. He is aiming to end his Gator career with another top-10 finish.
“We haven’t played particularly 
well,” Alexander said. “(We) need Tyler to come around and start playing a little bit better. … We haven’t had a lot of top-10 finishes individually this semester.”

 Center Patric Young will return 
to Florida for his senior season 
in 2013-14, the team announced Monday.
  After saying he needed to dis-
cuss his decision with his family following UF’s Elite Eight loss to Michigan on March 31, Young chose not to leave school for the NBA.
  “I have the chance to ﬁ  nish my 
degree and play another season for coach (Billy) Donovan with great teammates and friends at a place I love,” Young said in a re-lease.
  “These ﬁ  rst three years have 
gone by in a ﬂ  ash, and I can’t be-lieve it is my senior year already. I have gotten better as a player and better as a man at the University of Florida. I believe God has my future in his hands, so all I am worried about now is getting bet-ter this summer and making it the hardest I have trained in my life.”
  Before Monday, many mock 
draft websites projected Young as a second-round pick. DraftEx-press.com listed the 6-foot-9, 249-pound Young as the 38th player on the board. NBADraft.net had him at No. 53.
  “This was Patric’s decision to 
make,” Donovan said in a release. “He ultimately had to do what he felt was best for himself and his future.”
  Young’s return bolsters Flor-
ida’s frontcourt in 2013-14. The Gators add 6-foot-9 forward Chris Walker, a ﬁ  ve-star recruit. Damontre Harris — once South Carolina’s starting center — is eligible to play next season after sitting out the 2012-13 campaign per NCAA transfer rules. Dorian Finney-Smith, a 6-foot-8 forward who transferred to Florida after one season at Virginia Tech in 2011-12, will also join the Gators’ frontcourt next season.
  Forwards Will Yeguete and 
Casey Prather, who combined for 9.5 rebounds per game off the bench in 2012-13, also return for their senior seasons.
  Young is just 122 points shy of 
becoming the 50th Gator to reach 1,000 career points.
  Throughout his junior year, 
Young was a reliable scorer but an inconsistent rebounder. He aver-aged 10.1 points and 6.3 rebounds but did not post consecutive games with at least 10 boards.
  Young shot 58.6 percent from 
the ﬁ  eld, which places second on the team of players with at least 10 shots.
  But his free-throw percentage 
dropped to 48.9 percent last sea-son — 10.4 percentage points low-er than his 2011-12 mark. Young ﬁ  nished with the lowest percent-age among Gators who attempted at least 30 free throws.
  He improved as a shot blocker, 
averaging 1.6 blocks — twice as many as he collected as a sopho-more. His 34 steals were tied for third-best on the squad.
  Young recorded 16 points and 
nine rebounds in UF’s second-round victory against Northwest-ern State but then struggled dur-ing the remainder of the NCAA Tournament.
  In Florida’s ﬁ  nal three games, 
Young averaged 5.7 points on 35.3 percent shooting and 6.3 boards. He made only 9 of 20 free-throw attempts during the Big Dance.

 No T.J. Vogel, no problem.
The Gators men’s golf team put 
up one of their best ﬁ  nishes in the ﬁ  rst two rounds of a tournament this spring in the Gary Koch Invita-tional, despite Vogel’s absence. 
  The Koch Invitational in Tampa 
is the last regular season tourna-ment for Florida before the South-eastern Championship on April 19.  The Gators are in fourth place go-ing into the ﬁ  nal round.
  “We haven’t played well this 
semester at all,” coach Buddy Alex-ander said.    “I’ve said it before: I’ve been the luckiest guy in the world as far as injuries and illnesses are concerned, but we’ve had the ﬂ  u; we’ve had mono; we’ve had a sports hernia; we’ve had open heart surgery; we’ve had it all this year.”
  Vogel is preparing to play in the 
Masters on Thursday as an ama-teur. Florida overcame his absence on Monday.
  The best ﬁ  nisher for the Gators 
in the ﬁ  rst round freshman A.J. Crouch, who shot a 72 (E) in the ﬁ  rst round and a 70 (-2) in the sec-ond round to ﬁ  nish tied for 13th. 
  Crouch has had an up-and-down 
freshman year.  He ﬁ  nished tied for fourth in the ﬁ  rst tournament of the season, but in the Gators last out-ing, he ﬁ  nished tied for 57th.
  Next up for the Gators was se-
nior Tommy Mou, who came in tied for 20th after shooting even par (72) in his ﬁ  rst two rounds.  
  Mou has played in only three 
tournaments this season. One ap-pearance came as an individual, but he was able to keep Florida buoyed by not shooting over par. 
  Freshman Eric Banks contin-
ued his strong spring season after overcoming a ﬁ  rst round 75 (+3) to shoot a 70 (-2) in the second round and tie for 25th.
  Banks has been the biggest sur- UF golf

PHILIBUSTER
  Finding a capable replacement for Ca-
leb Sturgis is a thought that surely gives Will Muschamp headaches. 
Heck, it might even give him nightmares at this point, and the season is still more than four months away.
  Muschamp joked near the end of last 
season that Florida was “looking for an ex-tra year of eligibility” for the redshirt se-nior kicker.
  Gone is the two-time Lou Groza Award 
ﬁ  nalist, an honor given to the nation’s best kicker.
  Gone is the nearly automatic right leg 
that took the pressure off of Florida’s un-derperforming offense by essentially guar-anteeing three points if the Gators could at least advance past inside the opposition’s 40-yard line.
  Gone is the pro-
gram’s all-time leader in ﬁ  eld goals made.
  But more im-
portant than what is gone is what is returning for the 
Gators in the kicking department next sea-son. And if Saturday’s performances dur-ing the Orange and Blue Debut are any in-dication, the cupboard is pretty bare.
  Neither senior Brad Phillips nor red-
shirt freshman Austin Hardin was particu-larly impressive during drills or at the end of scrimmage periods. No ofﬁ  cial statistics were kept, but simply watching was more than enough for me.
  Kicks missed left. Kicks missed right. 
One kick resembled a clay pigeon shot out of the sky at a shooting range, slamming into the left upright and bouncing away.
  Florida’s offense again looked average. 
The kicking game was a mess.
  And from statements made by coaches 
and players, it is clear this was not a one-day outlier. Rather, inconsistency from the two kickers has become the norm.
  “I’m not going to lie, we’re missing St-
urgis right now,” punter Kyle Christy said earlier this spring. “But … it’s deﬁ  nitely not because of lack of effort.”
  Of course it isn’t. Nobody wants to 
struggle when replacing a program legend,

twitter: @phillip_heilman  Think of that kid trying to make a full rev-
olution on a swing at the playground. They gain enough momentum to reach 
the apex — the point of no return where they either swing all the way around or fall back down to square one. Florida has been stuck at square one.
  Tonight’s matchup in Tallahassee at 6 
features two teams in the midst of two very different seasons. The No. 7 Seminoles (27-5) are continuing their ascension with a veteran starting rotation. The Gators (15-18) are strug-gling to keep their heads above water with a collection of young talent. Yet, three games under .500 doesn’t do the Gators justice. 
  NFL Hall of Famer 
Bill Parcells said, “You are what your record says you are.” ESPN has a show nobody watches called “Num-
bers Never Lie.” The numbers don’t tell the story for Florida.
  In a game where miscues are magniﬁ  ed, 
the Gators have drowned in their own blun-ders. Six losses stand out.
  Florida lost to Georgia Southern 8-7 in ex-tra innings on Feb. 20, Florida Gulf Coast 7-4 on Feb. 24 in extra innings, North Florida 7-6 on Feb. 26 in 10 innings and Ole Miss 4-3 on March 29 in 11 frames. The Gators dropped the series ﬁ  nale against Vanderbilt 5-4 in sev-en innings on March 24 while losing to Florida State 2-1 late on March 26. 
  All these games should’ve ended with the 
Gators slapping hands in the inﬁ  eld instead of wondering what went wrong. 
Florida suffered a six-game losing streak 
earlier in the year that catcher Taylor Gushue called the Gators’ lowest point this season. Since dropping its sixth straight contest on March 1 — dropping UF to 3-7 — Florida is 12-11.
The Gators’ losses to the Rebels, the Com-
modores and the Seminoles mirrored those during their six-game losing streak.
If Florida could eliminate its issues in close 
contests, reaching the NCAA Regional again this year is a real possibility. 
  But an inconsistent season is expected from 
this ravaged roster. For three years, Florida ﬁ  elded one of college baseball’s most talented squads — ever. 
  Five players from the 2012 team spent time 
in Major League spring training. Left-hander Steven Rodriguez became the ﬁ  rst player from the 2012 MLB Draft to reach the majors. He’s pitched two scoreless innings for the Dodgers this year. Catcher Mike Zunino has a .417 aver-age for the Seattle Mariners’ Triple-A afﬁ  liate. The Gators of yesteryear were really good. 
  Take into account key signees never reach-
ing school, and it’s clear why Florida isn’t Florida this year. A down year comes with a mass exodus to The Show. This team is grow-ing, albeit slowly. 
  Freshman shortstop Richie Martin looks 
like a budding star up the middle. I’ll take a middle inﬁ  eld of Martin and second baseman Casey Turgeon any day. Gushue at catcher — although he needs work defensively — is car-rying Florida’s offense. Doubles machine Jus-tin Shafer has been a consistent run producer. Florida’s pitching has improved since several early-season hiccups.
  It’s time to see the silver lining. I described 
Florida on Feb. 27 as a “talented team yet to ﬁ  nd answers.” The answers may never come this year. 
 Is the 2013 season  disappointing? Yeah. But in an adverse season riddled with in-
juries and departures, these young guns are giving a glimpse of a bright future. Remember that when two very different teams square off at Dick Howser Field tonight.
