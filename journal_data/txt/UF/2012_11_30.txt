The plans to open an ice rink down-
town have been delayed again. But the 
city hopes to appease any frustrated patrons by offering some holiday fun for free.
The ice rink, previously scheduled 
to open today , will open Monday in the Bo Diddley Community Plaza. The rink will offer free entry — skates included — until Wednesday.
The rink will stay open until Jan. 13. 
After Wednesday , skating will cost $10 an hour. If a patron brings his or her own ice skates, the price is $7 an hour.
Midwest Display Inc., the holiday-
display company managing the rink, had technical difﬁ  culties installing the tent that will house the Plaza Ice Pal-ace.
Russell Etling, city cultural affairs 
programs coordinator, said there were some issues getting the 35-foot-tall tent installed. The tent houses the custom-made ice rink, and the rink can’t be fro-zen until the tent is ﬁ  nished.
The ﬁ  nished project will include 
lighting displays across the plaza and holiday-themed murals on the ply-wood walls surrounding the ice.
The downtown plaza has been with-
out an annual ice rink since the city-funded ice rink shut down in 2007 due to budget issues, according to Alligator archives. Midwest Display Inc. brought the rink back this year and is setting up the ice rink at its own expense as a ven-dor.
“Everybody is very excited about it 
opening and returning to Gainesville,” Etling said. “It’s a great opportunity for family fun and celebrating the holiday season.”

Starting in Spring, students will be able 
to check out iPads from Library West.
The library will have 30 iPads available 
and two backups, said Anne Allen, assistant director of UF Information Technology.
The program is an extension of the net-
books for checkout at Library West. Unlike 
the netbooks, which have a two-hour circu-lation time and must stay within the library, the iPads will be allowed out of library doors.
Diane Bruxvoort, the senior associate 
dean for scholarly resources and research services, said the library hasn’t decided how long students will be able to check out the iPads.
She said the overdue policy has also not 
been decided yet, but it will be similar to the netbook overdue charge system.
The netbook program has a $10 charge 
for every hour it is overdue. After 10 hours, it is considered lost, and users must pay a $2,000 replacement fee, according to the li-brary website. iPads to become available for checkout in Spring

Lennie Kesl could ﬁ  nd art in 
almost anything.
He would often scoop up 
rusted bolts or rocks on his 
way to John Tilton’s studio and present them to his friend with unfettered enthusiasm.“He paint-
ed these little faces on rocks he found,” Tilton said. “They would be treasures to him.”
Kesl, a 
well-known Gainesville artist and former art teacher at UF and Santa Fe College, died this weekend after falling down a ﬂ  ight of stairs.
Friends remember the 
86-year-old as energetic, friend-ly and passionate about his work.
Tilton would sculpt ceram-
ics and pottery that would be painted by Kesl, who often in-cluded oddly colored women with large, triangular noses.
Tilton said Kesl never need-
ed to wait for inspiration.
“When he got here, he was 
ready to work,” Tilton said. “It was just go, go, go.”

Gay Movie Night is the last Friday of each month at 7:30 p.m. and is a free service of the Pride Community Center of North Central Florida.

� THE BOOK NOOK WILL OPEN ON 
DEC. 7.
COLLEEN WRIGHT
Alligator Contributing Writer
In the days of instant downloads and 
electronic pages, Roger Beebe finds peace in 
a bound book.
Beebe, the owner of Video Rodeo, at 1119 
W. University Ave., will celebrate his store’s eighth birthday with the unveiling of the Book Nook, a micro-store for used books. The opening will be at Video Rodeo on Dec. 7.
“It seems like a good time to go in the 
other direction,” Beebe said. “It’s a different viewing from reading books on a page.”
Video Rodeo, an independent DVD and 
Blu-ray rental store, will open the Book Nook in the front of the store near the register.
With 32 feet of shelving, Beebe said there 
are about 500 books so far, and there’s room for more. Customers will soon be able to trade used books for ones on the shelf.
In the Spring, a friend approached Beebe 
with the idea to open a bookstore in down-town Gainesville. After the pair looked over the expenses, which racked up to $1,500 a month, Beebe thought the idea wasn’t pos-sible.
Beebe said he was inspired to have a used 
book corner in his store after visiting an Eng-lish-language bookstore in Berlin while he was teaching in the summer.
“It really gets your juices flowing,” he 
said.
Beebe began to think of having a small, 
used bookstore in his store because the real estate was paid and the store was staffed. When his friend became too busy, Beebe started stocking books.
He began collecting titles about three 
months ago. Many are donations from friends, including Beebe’s colleagues in the UF’s English department.
Padgett Powell, a UF creative writing pro-
fessor, is donating a few books he wrote to Beebe’s Book Nook.
“We can always use a bookstore, particu-
larly in the days of Netflix,” he said.
Beebe said he’s not in this venture to make 
money. He’s just in it for the books.
“We want to make an argument for why 
we still love books,” he said.Video rental store to celebrate birthday by opening book corner4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 2012

Between the weight training, 
jump roping, sprinting and spar -
ring, members of UF’s Kickboxing 
Club have been training for months, some even years.
On Saturday , the competing 
members will show it at the Florida Collegiate Boxing Conference in Tal-lahassee.
About 2,000 people are expected 
to attend the conference this week-end. 
UF is one of seven schools com-
peting and will send four UF stu-dents — Antonio Benitez, Hunter Clonts, Nico Sanchez and Robbie Young — and one Santa Fe College student, Cornelius White. 
They’ll compete with Florida 
International University, the Uni-versity of Miami and Florida State University.
“At UF, we consider ourselves 
winners in everything, and that’s what we’re gonna do,” saidYoung, president of the kickboxing club and a 22-year-old industrial and systems engineeringsenior.
This is the club’s first year as a 
sports club registered with the South-west Recreation Center, though it has been around as a student orga-nization since 2008, said head coach J.C. Papaleo Giron. 
It holds practice at Southwest 
Rec on Mondays and Wednesdays at 7:30 p.m.
“Once that bell rings, they’re like 
an astronaut, they’re in orbit,” said Giron, 41.
There are boxing proverbs that 
say when two fighters meet in the ring, their souls touch, he said.
One moment they’re trying to 
attack each other, and then the bout will end, and they’ll embrace.Papaleo Giron would know: The 
former New Yorker even boxed un-der coach Hector Roca, who trained Hilary Swank for her role in “Mil-lion Dollar Baby.”
“If [a boxer] gets hit, gets hurt — 
fear kicks in,” Giron said. “It’s a very psychological game.”
The club members are anxiously 
awaiting Saturday . 
Megan Oliva, a 20-year-old po-
litical science and telecommunica-tion sophomore, isn’t competing but will go to Tallahassee to support theteam.
“I’m really excited about seeing 
all the guys’ hard work pay off,” she said.

UF’s Starry Night could give 
Vincent van Gogh a run for his 
money.
UF is hosting its yearly astron-
omy program, Starry Night, at the Florida Museum of Natural His-tory on Friday at 6 p.m.
The one-night event will al-
low guests to explore the universe through multiple telescopes.
“It’s definitely fun for the 
whole family ,” said Paul Ramey , assistant director for marketing and public relations for the Flori-da Museum of Natural History.
This is the sixth year for the 
program.
Jen Black is excited to go see 
the stars again.
“I’ve been to something like this before, and it was really cool. It was when I was younger, but I think when you enjoy something educational like that when you’re young, it’s cool when you’re old-er, too,” said Black, a 22-year-old UF criminology and psychology senior.
There will be speeches by lead-
ers in the fields and a display of space art.
“This is definitely an opportu-
nity to speak with professionals in the field and interact with equip-ment they otherwise wouldn’t have a chance,” Harvey said.Astronomy program will

WERE SURVEYED. ANDREA CARROZ

When it comes to LGBTQ treat-
ment, Florida’s cities show a full 
spectrum of equality.
The Human Rights Campaign, 
a civil rights organization, pub-lished its first Municipal Equal-ity Index on Tuesday. The study evaluates city laws and policies re-lated to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, said Jeremy Pittman, deputy field director at the Human Rights Campaign.
Miami, Orlando, Tampa, Tal-
lahassee and Jacksonville were among the 11 Florida cities sur -
veyed. Of those, Orlando did the best, and Jacksonville did the worst.
Orlando scored 77 out of 100 
points. Miami came in second with 72 points. Miami Shores and Jacksonville came in last, with 34 and 15 points, respectively.
The study focused on whether 
a city has a law that prohibits dis-crimination against employees on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity . It also looked at laws that apply to private-sector employers that prohibit discrimi-nation, he said.
The study surveyed 137 cities 
around the country. The selected cities included the 50 state capitals, the 50 largest cities by population and 75 additional cities based on size.
Twenty-five large, 25 mid-size 
and 25 small cities with the high-est proportion of same-sex couples were picked by the campaign based on the 2010 census data, Pittman said.
Eleven cities in the U.S., includ-
ing Los Angeles, San Diego, Se-attle, New York City and Philadel-phia, received the full 100 points.Three cities received zero 
points: Montgomery, Ala., Frank-fort, Ky., and Jefferson City, Mo.
“I think the results show us that 
there’s been tremendous work done at the municipal level all across the country to protect lesbi-an, gay , bisexual, and transgender citizens and residents,” Pittman said. “But there’s still work to be done.”
The city of Gainesville was not 
included in this year’s Municipal Equality Index because the survey didn’t cover every city in the U.S.
“There’s been a lot of work 
done in Gainesville on LGBT equality, and we’d love to be able to highlight the good work that’s been done there,” he said.
Terry Fleming, co-president 
of the Pride Community Center of North Central Florida, said the scores for the cities in Florida were predictable. If Gainesville were on the list, he said, “I’m sure it would rate very high.” 
Equality index ranks Orlando, Miami 
as best Florida cities for LGBTQ rights

50% NOWe should form a society built on love
For many of us, myself included, this semester has been 
probably one of the most stressful times of our lives.
For incoming freshmen, the coursework is often 
much more rigorous than they initially expected.
For sophomores and juniors, doing well enough to sim-
ply stay in school can sometimes be a day-to-day odyssey.
For seniors, the need to keep their grades up in their last 
year tempers the excitement about graduation.
For graduate students, balancing the often obscene course 
load with research, teaching, work, families and whatever sliver of a social life they may still manage to have can feel too overwhelming to bear.
We can add world events that the media forces us to keep 
in mind every day to all of this, and it becomes no wonder that life can be a struggle.
I have literally never experienced a more stressful time 
in my almost 24 years. In the course of four months, which have ﬂ  own by at an alarmingly rapid pace, I have driven myself to near insanity managing my coursework, my as-sistantship and my relationships.
Before this semester began, the last thing I expected — or 
desired — was to ﬁ  nd romance, and yet that is what hap-pened only a week or two before the ﬁ  rst day of school.
Then, in what seemed like almost the same short amount 
of time, that relationship crashed and burned a few weeks ago. In short, this hasn’t been an easy few months.
Luckily, most of you probably haven’t felt as over-
whelmed as others. This semester was probably a breeze for many of you.
If that’s the case, cherish it! It’s good to start an academic 
year on a positive note.
But no matter how your semester has gone or how you 
expect the next one to go, it’s important to remember that love will always be on your side.
I’m not referring simply to romantic love — as you might 
imagine, I’m telling romantic love to go eff itself for a little while.
What I am referring to is the need to see beauty in every-day life and in people no matter how you’re feeling or what you’re going through. 
Of course, this is frequently 
easier said than done. Personally, I’ve been having trouble seeing this beauty on a day-to-day basis for a while now.
But I always remember it’s 
there. And I make a point to force myself to recognize it, no matter how blurry it seems to be.
Obviously, I’m extremely fascinated by politics.I think we, as citizens of a nation, have a responsibility to 
be informed and participate in the functions that make our society operate. Of course — and thank goodness — there’s more to our society than government, economics and poli-tics.
However, no matter how much we may try to distance 
ourselves from these institutions, they are omnipresent as-pects of our lives that we should recognize and engage with as much as we can.
Because of the importance of these institutions, we 
should try as citizens to push them in directions that em-phasize love. 
I know this sounds like a lofty, idealistic and abstract no-
tion. But I believe the politics I and many others stand for are those that emphasize love toward others. It’s why we push for peace and equality.
In a nutshell, we need to ensure our society is built on 
love.
In a world with so much stress, grief, hatred, anger, war, 
confusion and loss, this idea clearly can become a dead let-ter. It becomes lost in abstraction and generalization.
But after a year and semester such as this, I hope many 
of you agree with me that it’s never been more important to hold ﬁ  rm on that principle.

Her car, which was traveling at the posted speed limit, was totaled in the exchange with the deputy. We give a this-deﬁ  nitely-seems-like-a-ton-of-unnecessary-force DART to t hat St. Lucie County

On Thursday afternoon, President Obama had lunch with 
Mitt Romney at the White House. Now, there are a ton of jokes we could make about this. No, really. But instead, we’ll let a Gawker headline regarding the story do all the work for us. We give a “Barack-Obama-Ate-Some-White-Turkey-With-a-White-Turkey-Today” LAUREL to Obama. Also, he totally 
treated Romney like that girl who invites you over, and you think it’s a date, but really she just wants to hear your opinion on her outﬁ  ts for her date with someone else. It’s just like that.
Hey, Lindsay Lohan. Wanna chill out? In case the rest of you 
haven’t heard, she was arrested early Thursday morning for punching some girl out. She was also charged on the same day for a car crash, which occurred in June, in California. We give a SIT-DOWN-AND-STOP-DOING-THINGS DART to Lindsay 
Lohan. Plus, did any of you watch “Liz and Dick”? Because that was also an arrestable offense on all of humanity.

Newark, N.J., Mayor Cory Booker is about to take the food 
stamp challenge; he’ll use the monetary equivalent of food stamps for seven days in December. When politicians or celeb-rities do the food stamp challenge, it almost seems offensive to Americans who actually rely on food stamps as a means of survival. However, he seems to be doing it for all the right reasons. Perhaps he can use the knowledge he learns from the experience to better advocate governmental assistance. We give a you’re-probably-setting-a-good-example-but-also-food-stamps-aren’t-something-to-use-for-attention FLART to May-

You want to make a differ-
ence to better the environ-ment, but you wonder if 
one person can even make an im-pact. 
So start small, ﬁ  rst by losing 
the pessimistic attitude.
You hear others barking “Re-
duce, Reuse, Recycle,” but you 
have a bah-humbug attitude, be-lieving that your contributions will only be in vain and will not improve anything.
This, my friend, is not true at 
all. By simply recycling one glass bottle, you can save enough elec-tricity to power a 100-watt bulb for four hours. By recycling one aluminum can, you can run a TV for six hours on the electricity saved.
Recycling not your thing?Maybe it’s not convenient 
enough for your lifestyle. Try switching your paper billing to electronic bills and opt for online bill pay. Many banks and utility companies are offering this option to their customers, which would save you time and reduce the amount of paper used.
It’s a cascade effect. Reducing 
the amount of paper wasted will help prevent deforestation and re-duce glob-al warm-ing.
T h e r e 
are many 
things an individual can do, such as hopping on a bus instead of taking the car, or using a reus-able shopping bag when visiting the grocery store. You can change your traditional incandescent light bulbs in your house to LEDs or compact ﬂ  uorescent light bulbs.
Compact ﬂ  uorescent light 
bulbs use at least two-thirds less energy than standard incandes-cent bulbs to provide the same amount of light, and they last up to 10 times longer.
With the plethora of small 
things available, you can make big differences. It only takes one small stone cast across water to create many ripples.
At least try to make a differ-
ence in your own life or the lives of your children. Plant that seed in them.
Let your new positive attitude 
toward helping the environment be your small stone.

Speaking OutMarco Rubio is “not a sci-
entist, man.” 
Thank goodness for 
that.
Recently , the senator was 
asked how old he thought Earth was. He said it was one of “the great mysteries.”
As it happens, it isn’t.Unfortunately, a great num-
ber of religious fundamentalists disagree with him for the wrong reasons. According to Gallup, 46 percent of Americans believe humans were created sometime within the last 10,000 years. That percentage is slightly higher to-day than it was 30 years ago. 
This is frightening.Saying humans were cre-
ated within the last 10,000 years is tantamount to saying the sun goes around the Earth. To sci-entists, there is no question that the Earth, and all of the life on its surface, is the product of pro-cesses that have been running for a very, very long time.
It bafﬂ  es me that someone, es-
pecially an elected ofﬁ  cial, could believe this stuff.
As a senator, such ignorance 
could very well be destructive.
Are we really such prideful 
people that so many of us don’t have it in our hearts to question our beliefs? I have a somewhat hostile sentimentality toward un-questioned dogma.
One can be terribly mistaken 
in his or her beliefs, no matter how much he or she wants to believe in something. We’ve all been there.Why is it, then, 
that for matters most important and eternal that people seem to be the least willing to question themselves very strongly?
I think Bill Nye 
was right to say “you should question your beliefs” if they conﬂ  ict with what the data shows.
If it’s a fundamental doctrine 
of your religion that Apollo drives a chariot across the sky , then it’s probably time to question your faith. If there’s ever a problem with religious fundamentalism, it comes as a consequence of the fundamentals of the religion.
I’m not sure if there’s any 
shortcut to knowledge. Knowl-edge has to be built from the ground up, bit by painstaking bit, observation by observation.
This is how a sure foundation 
is built.
With enough observations, 
creation is eventually possible. With our understandings of the world, we have built complex machines to peer across the uni-verse, connect us all over the In-ternet and even toast bread.
Unfortunately , to paraphrase 
Carl Sagan, people accept the products of science but reject its methods. 
Recently , Israel and Hamas 
agreed to a cease-ﬁ  re. I doubt it will last, though. It is the reli-gious prerogative of Hamas to ﬁ  ght the Jews.
The Hamas Charter, also called the Hamas Covenant, says things like, “The Day of Judge-ment will not come about until Moslems ﬁ  ght the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide be-hind stones and 
trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.” 
Is there any question that 
these people are motivated by their religion at least in some small part?
Is there any question that if 
these people were to question their faith more frequently and fervently , their beliefs might be at least a little different?
If we were to all take the time 
to sincerely question ourselves, especially about the things we hold most dearly , what kind of people would we be? If we were to make more of an effort to re-lieve ourselves of our cognitive dissonance, what kind of a world would we live in?
The world would almost cer-
tainly be a different — probably even a better — place. Only good can come from wanting to know the truth.
To believe in lies, or anything 
less than truth, isn’t as desirable, I think.

opinions@alligator.orgThis was symptomatic of Kesl’s energetic personal-
ity.
Though his energy was focused when he was 
working, Tilton said Kesl would practically bounce off the walls.
When Kesl was in his 60s, he used to ride his bike 
12 miles one-way to Tilton’s studio.
“He had the energy of someone in his 20s,” Tilton 
said. “I couldn’t keep up with him, and I’m 18 years 
younger than he is.”
Kesl shared his energy and enthusiasm with his UF 
and Santa Fe College students during his time as an art professor.
Richard Heipp, director of UF’s school of art and 
art history, said though Kesl was aging, he rarely missed an art exhibition or showing.
“At 86, he certainly hadn’t slowed down,” Heipp 
said. “He was also a very talented musician. He had a Louis Armstrong kind of voice.”
Heipp said Kesl was a staple of the Gainesville art 
scene, appearing at almost every art showing and gal-lery opening in Alachua County.
Kesl seemed to be in his element at art shows, 
Heipp said.
Tilton said Kesl would talk to anyone within ear-
shot and often walk away with a new friend.
“He would talk to you like he was your best friend,” 
Tilton said, “but he didn’t know your name.”
His friendliness earned him the distinction as a 
Gainesville art icon and won him many friends, like Satchel Raye, the owner of Satchel’s Pizza.
Raye will display some of Kesl’s work alongside 
his own at Satchel’s Pizza from Tuesday until Jan. 2.
“It’ll be fun to put his stuff up,” Raye said. “But 
it’ll be hard to think about him and realize that he’s gone.”

Reakes said he expects the tab-
lets to get heavy use.
The netbook checkout pro-
gram is constantly in circula-tion, Bruxvoort said. She said the  netbooks each get checked out about 100 times a day.
For the iPad loaning pro-
gram, once the iPad is re-turned, the recharging cart will sweep all personal information off it.
An iPad loaning program 
was an initiative brought to UF Information Technology by Student Government. The program is funded by the tech-nology fee, which each student has to pay per credit hour.
About $1 million from the 
total fee goes toward technol-ogy grants each year, Allen said.
An advisory committee 
consisting of students, UF IT representatives and faculty chose which projects to fund.The iPad program was 
funded from the leftover mon-ey of another project that didn’t use all of its funds. It cost about $25,000, Allen said.
“It’s really good use of that 
money because it’s going back to something the students use,” Reakes said.
He said iPad rental pro-
grams are something other li-braries have started to do.
The Thomas Cooper Li-
brary at the University of South Carolina loans iPads out to students for three days and employees for ﬁ  ve days. They have 20 iPads and as of press time, one was available, according to the university’s library website.
Student Senate President 
Christina Bonarrigo said this was something UF students wanted.
“I think it’s going to be a 
huge success on our campus,” she said.

Young athletes will have the 
chance to shine at Alachua County’s 
ﬁ  rst Special Olympics this weekend.
Rooted on by UF cheerleaders, 
Olympic torchbearer Jillian Roberts and the mayor of Gainesville, dis-abled preschool- and elementary-aged children will perform athletics including running, jumping and throwing, said event coordinator Krista Vandenborne.
The Special Olympics will take 
place at St. Francis Catholic High School, 4100 NW 115th St., from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Sunday.The program is being hosted by 
Balance 180, an organization found-ed this year by two UF professors. Vandenborne, the chairwoman of UF’s Department of Physical Ther-apy , is among the professors who helped found Balance 180.
She said the young athletes — 
ages 2 through 7 with disabilities ranging from Down syndrome to cerebral palsy — have been prepar-ing for the event all semester with training sessions.
At the bi-weekly practices, chil-
dren cycled through different sta-tions set up inside a gym equipped with exercise mats, balls and other tools to work on basic skills like bal-ance.
“They learn how to jump, how 
to use a racket, how to kick a ball,” Vandenborne said. “We teach them motor skills but also work on cog-nitive components. There’s lots of high-ﬁ  ves and lots of hugs, cheering each other on.”
She said combining counting, 
shapes and spatial concepts like “under” and “over” with physical therapy exercises strengthens the children’s minds and bodies at the same time.
Vandenborne said the athletes 
inspire her with their resolve and spirit. She said one in particular, 7-year-old Zavion, stood out in her mind.
“He’s in a wheelchair,” she said. 
“He’s one of those bright, shiny kids. He loves to dance.”
After practice, Vandenborne 
said, the children love to dance to “Gangnam Style.” Two volunteers held Zavion up so he could stand beside his wheelchair and groove to the music.
This is the ﬁ  rst year the nation-
wide program has been offered in Alachua County, and Vanden-borne said she thinks it’s a ﬁ  t for Gainesville.“I think we’re a perfect town to 
do it,” she said. “Sports are a big deal in Gainesville. A lot of times the ways we socialize are through sports, and it’s the same for children with disabilities.”
Sijun Li, a 20-year-old public re-
lations junior who has been doing advertising for the event, said assist-ing with the Special Olympics has been satisfying.
“It’s really rewarding to know 
the kids are going to have such an amazing event to showcase all the hard work they’ve put into the train-ing sessions,” she said. “They have a lot of talent to show.”

Newell Hall could provide stu-
dents with relief from crowded librar -
ies if UF’s Board of Trustees approves 
a proposal for the building’s renova-tion at its meeting next week.
The measure would transform 
Newell into a bookless study cen-ter with digital resources and areas for students to plug in laptops, UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said.
Newell, which is listed on the Na-
tional Register of Historic Places, is one of UF’s original buildings that hasn’t been updated, Sikes said. The renovation project was introduced in 2009 but was delayed due to lack of funding.
Newell stands across Buckman 
Drive from Turlington Hall and was previously home to the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, which vacated due to the facility’s old age.
“This will be a perfect retroversion 
for one of the campus’ original build-ings,” she said, adding that the histor -
ical nature of the hall would be pre-served in the proposed renovation.
The proposed funding is a result of 
leftover money from the Reitz Union renovation and expansion project, which comes from the Capital Im-provement Trust Fund that students pay in tuition, said Student Body President Tj Villamil.
The $2-per-credit-hour fee raised 
$13 million more than the $20 million needed for the Reitz Union project.
The fund exists specifically for nonacademic buildings on campus, Villamil said. For example, the money has been previously used to remake the Southwest Recreation Center.
Villamil said that according to the 
2011 UF Student Experience in the Research University Survey, students cited more study space as “the single, most important thing” that the uni-versity could do to improve their un-dergraduate experiences.
The survey, which is administered 
to undergraduates, had a 63 percent response rate, according to survey re-sults.
Library crowding is an issue, espe-
cially during finals season, said Emily Witt, a forestry and economics junior.
Witt, 20, sat at one of the few open 
tables at Library West on Wednesday. She usually opts for the Levin College of Law Library because of overcrowd-ing.
“During finals, it’s not even worth 
it to come here sometimes,” she said.
Villamil said there will be a student 
engagement process in the Spring, but he believes students are already sup-portive of the proposed renovation.
“I think it’s incredible that we’re 
bringing one of the most historical buildings on campus … to the 21st century,” he said, “that can be used with students in years to come.”

A sketch comedy troupe of UF students 
and alumni will put on its original, full-length 
show “Generation 15 Presents: Risky Business” this weekend.
Generation Sketch Comedy has been prepar -
ing since early September for the free events, which are scheduled for 8 p.m. on Friday and Saturday in Reitz Union, Room 285 and Room 282, respectively.
The troupe will perform about 30 sketches 
at each show, said director and 21-year-old ad-vertising senior Dan LeVine.
“We do this because we love to entertain 
and make people laugh,” he said. “All we need are people to come out and laugh at us.”
The event’s Facebook page has more than 
100 people attending. Larissa Scott, a 19-year-old telecommunication sophomore, said she was interested in the show’s “Saturday Night Live”-like format.
Generation’s 13-member team comprises 
a mix of undergraduate students and alumni, and it’s this combination that creates a unique comedic dynamic, LeVine said.
“There’s all sorts of experience and talent on 
the team,” he said.
Together, the eclectic group brainstormed 
“Risky Business” as its show title.
“We wanted something catchy, interest-
ing. It also had to make sense,” LeVine said. “While people should not expect a show ex-plicitly about ‘Risky Business,’ we want people to leave and think, ‘Oh, now I get it.’”UF comedy

This holiday season, a Gainesville 
printing business is asking residents 
to put their money where their hearts are.
Dragonfly Graphics is asking 
Gainesville residents to do their holiday shopping locally at its sec-ond annual The Loco Bizarre, which will be held on Dec. 23 from noon to 9 p.m.
The free event will take place at 
the Dragonfly Graphics’ shop, 319 SW Third Ave. The shop is a histori-cal 1927 home commercialized to ac-commodate the printing press and dryer that make up the 26-year-old T-shirt business.
The Loco Bizarre aims to raise a 
sense of community in the holidays by bringing together vendors, mu-sicians and residents for a day of family-friendly shopping.
“It’s to encourage folks to spend 
their holiday money at home,” said Aimee Anderson, 36-year-old sales and marketing director for Dragon-fly Graphics. 
The event will feature live screen-
printing demonstrations of new designs for the store’s Gainesville Nostalgia line. The line recalls clas-sic Gainesville and features designs of old Gainesville staples, such as Skeeter’s Breakfast House, now closed, and Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park.
Guests can make T-shirt orders 
at the event, see how their shirts are printed and participate in the pro-cess. Outside the shop, a wide array of local vendors will be selling their unusual creations by a bonfire.
“You never know what you’re 
going to find, and that’s the bizarre part of it,” Anderson said.
Of the about 20 vendors that have 
signed up for the event, guests can expect anything from jewelry ven-dors to massage therapy to special cooking sauce vendors. Anderson said she hopes to represent the en-tire spectrum of the community .  
At last year’s event, April Burk 
Clark, 51, used The Loco Bizarre as a first opportunity to sell her crafts, which she made and sold for her booth at the event, called Junque.
Clark converts trash to art. Her 
crafts include anything from pencil holders to thumbtacks to mosaics. A lover of books, Clark rescues old books and folds their pages into a variety of shapes, such as trees or lanterns.
Many of the vendors were people 
who made crafts in their spare time, Clark said. The items on sale were useful, whimsical and affordable.
“You can go in with $5 and come 
out with something cool,” she said. Bazaar to host a variety

Out of four major U.S. cellphone 
service providers, V erizon was 
ranked the highest of its competitors in a mobile carrier satisfaction sur -
vey.
The results from the Consumer 
Reports National Resource Center’s 63,253-person survey remained the same as last year: V erizon stayed in the lead, Sprint and T-Mobile fol-lowed behind at second and third and AT&T held its last-place position.
The release also said no-contract 
plans, or prepaid phones, save cus-tomers about $20 a month.
Richard Lutz, a UF marketing pro-
fessor, said while this may be true, phones without the commitment of contracts have limits to heavy data users.“I think people are looking for 
price and want to get the best deal, but the most important thing is re-liability ,” he said. “You want it to work.”
V erizon has the highest-rated 
voice and data quality of the carri-ers, but AT&T’s LTE, or Long Term Evolution, network is considered the best, the release said.
C.J. Wittus, a manager of Best Buy 
Mobile, said V erizon has the largest amount of coverage everywhere for 4G LTE, but AT&T provides better service in certain areas due to its more widespread 4G network.  
Wittus, a 20-year-old UF criminol-
ogy junior, agreed with the report’s claim that V erizon is the best, but he said AT&T deserves more credit.

Since the Porters Commu-
nity Farm opened in August, the 
downtown vacant-lot-turned-garden has received a collection of in-kind donations: a lawn mower, a weed-whacker and ir -
rigation supplies.
But on Thursday , it received 
a gift that will keep giving — about 22 potted fruit trees.
Chestnut Hill Nursery con-
tributed $500 worth of apple, peach, nectarine, fig and pome-granate saplings, as well as blue-berry and blackberry bushes.
The Porters Community 
Farm is located in a low-income area where the annual house-hold income is about $13,000, compared with Gainesville’s average household income of about $27,000, according to a press release.  It’s an area that has historically been “under -
served,” said Travis Mitchell, the farm project manager.The trees will be planted 
next week on the farm property , Mitchell said. Most of the pro-duce will go to local charities, such as St. Francis House, to provide a reliable source of fresh food.
Gainesville community 
members can help plant the trees Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the garden, 518 SW Third St. 
Heather Blake, a Chestnut 
Hill Nursery sales representa-tive, said the plants were grown in the town of Alachua and are 1 to 3 years old. She said it will take another year for most of them to produce fruit once planted permanently.
“I know a lot of local garden-
ers who donate fresh produce when they have it,” Mitchell said. “I don’t know anyone lo-cally whose specific mission is to do that.” 
Blake said fruit trees seemed 
to be the ideal way to help the farm because they produce great results with little input.
“A lot of projects lack the vol-
unteer hours to keep them go-ing, whereas with fruit trees and berries, once you get the initial planting and irrigation installed, there’s minimal maintenance,” she said.
Blake said she is optimistic 
about the impact increased ac-cess to fresh fruits can have on low-income Gainesville fami-lies.
“There’s a real need for espe-
cially children, but also adults in the community, to have nutri-tional foods available to them,” she said. “Many kids these days don’t have the experience of having fresh fruits — most of it’s canned. We wanted them to ex-perience planting a tree and eat-ing the fruit.”

Library West’s electronic bookcases look 
like a trap from an Indiana Jones movie set.
However, most UF students aren’t as fear -
less as American icon Harrison Ford.
Some UF students who first meander 
through the bookcases at Library West are 
concerned that they will get stuck, squished or smashed in between them.
Stephanie Moses was scared she would 
get stuck in the bookcases that towered over her.
“You don’t usually check for someone,” 
said Moses, an 18-year-old biology freshman, who first discovered the cases this semester.
Moses said she was scared to go in and out 
of the aisles, and it took a few times moving the cases before she got used to them.
The contraption is all in the name of sav-
ing space.
The metal cases sit side-by-side like a set of 
dominos, and they’re so close that the shelves from one case touch the shelves of the other.
The electronic cases are installed into the 
ground, and each case moves to the right or left after a button is pressed. This creates a walkway in between so people can search through the shelves.
Only a few aisles can be created at once 
because they are so compressed.  Library visitors often move multiple cases to get the space between one shelf and another open.
Some have gotten hurt because they 
weren’t paying attention.
Chris Perez, 19, a book stacks personnel at 
Library West, said his boss saw a girl panic and run down the bookcases as they closed in on her more than a year ago. She scratched her arms on the corners of the books, he said.
“People can get stuck, but no one can get 
seriously hurt,”  the industrial and systems engineering sophomore added.
Warning stickers, meant to remind visitors 
to check the aisle before pressing the button, were tacked onto the ends of the cases during Spring 2012.
A warning sound goes off every time a 
case begins to move.Perez said the beep is loud and high-
pitched, but people wearing headphones may not hear anything.
There are four motion sensors on each 
case — two at each end.
Perez said the girl was near the middle of 
the aisle as it was closing.
The electronic cases at Library West were 
installed five years ago and have broken sev-eral times, said Edward Hart, technician at the Legal Information Center at UF.
It takes about six seconds to calmly walk 
from the middle of the aisle to one of the ends.
The bookcase closes about 15 seconds af-
ter the button is pressed.
“There’s plenty of time to get out,” Perez 
said.Students fret over getting trapped in stacks at Library West

Hamlet has a new question: To 
tweet or not to tweet?
Twitter literature is taking over 
the social media site as authors 
across the globe contribute to the first Twitter Fiction Festival, which started Wednesday.
The virtual festival, which ends 
Sunday, features about 30 authors from five continents and stories in five languages, according to Twit-ter’s blog post for the event.
Selections for the event range 
from tweets of Shakespeare lines to a retelling of 100 Greek myths in 100 tweets. It also features original stories such as a love affair between a teenage girl and a Sasquatch.
R. Brandon Kershner, a UF Eng-lish professor, said the event sounds “silly .” He said the 140-character limit doesn’t leave space for proper idea development.
“It seems like a particularly 
awkward way of writing fiction,” he said. 
Dave Carlson, executive director 
of UF’s Center for Media Innovation and Research, said the challenges offered by Twitter’s character limit could actually improve writing by encouraging concision.
“Anything that encourages peo-
ple to write helps writing, or at least can help writing,” he said.
Twitter encouraged all users to 
get involved and create their own stories using #twitterfiction.  The @twitterbooks account will highlight a select number of stories through-out the festival.Twitter fiction festival, 
literary world butt heads

The Sebastian Ferrero Office of 
Clinical Quality and Patient Safety 
at Shands at UF, the UF Academic Health Center, won second place and $15,000 in the Reporting Patient Safety Events Challenge this month.
“We were very excited about how the results turned out,” said Linda Allen, manager of the qual-ity system department and team leader of the challenge. “It reinforces the fact that we are on the cutting edge of performance improvement when it comes to reporting adverse events.”
The Houston team KBCoreSM 
won, according to a press release.Shands at UF teamed up with 
International Development, Inc., which is a software developer spe-cializing risk management.         
The contest had 36 teams come 
up with an online application that would make it easier to report ad-verse events or medical errors that could possibly hurt a patient.
“For example, if someone falls, we record it and are later able to identify the risk of falling and tell the staff how this can be improved,” said Randy Harmatz, chief quality officer of Shands at UF.
Shands and IDinc created an ap-
plication that allows a staff member to easily record incidents. The sys-tem is designed to receive the infor -
mation inputted and send alerts to people who need to know.
“The concept was to create a rev-
olution from the system that Shands currently uses and upgrade it to meet the necessary requirements,” said IDinc CEO Didier Salem. “I am very pleased and proud of our ac-complishments and with the coop-eration received from Shands.”
Allen said this recording of infor -
mation is already done at the hos-pital level, but there is currently no standardized way of doing so.
“This is a step into the right di-
rection to improving health care na-tionally,” she said.
Shands at UF office places second in national safety challenge

For the second time in school history, the 
Gators enter the NCAA Tournament with 
the Southeastern Conference Player of the Year, Freshman of the Year and Coach of the Year. 
However, 14th overall seed Florida (25-4, 
19-1), which plays Tulsa (26-9, 14-2 Confer -
ence USA) tonight at 7:30 in the O’Connell Center, would not be where it is today if not for its unsung heroes, coach Mary Wise said.
Wise, who has led Florida to 22 straight NCAA Tournament appearances, said set-ter Taylor Brauneis and libero Taylor Unroe have been instrumental in doing the grunt work for their grind-it-out team.
“It would be 
like a football team where at some point you have got to rec-
ognize the line and the quarterback,” Wise said. 
Brauneis, a junior transfer from Louisville, 
has taken the role of play caller for Florida. She led the SEC in assists with 1,141. 
Her average of 11.64 assists per set is 
12th-best in the nation.The addition of Brauneis to the Gators’ 
5-1 offense has given SEC Player of the Year Chloe Mann and SEC Freshman of the Year Ziva Recek prime opportunities for kills, Wise said.
“She just has a high volleyball IQ, and 
she plays the game (in) what looks to be with little effort as the ball comes out of her hands in such a killable way,” Wise said. “She’s the quarterback. She puts up very catchable passes. As our quarterback, she puts up very killable sets.”
Mann, who has been at the receiving end 
of many of Brauneis’ passes, said her setter has flawlessly adapted to a new environ-ment while also becoming one of the biggest components to Florida’s winning formula.LANDON WATNICK

Billy Donovan wanted to send Patric Young 
a message. Young heard him loud and clear.
Coming off the bench for the first time since 
Feb. 2, Young was a force in No. 7 Florida’s 82-
49 win against Marquette on Thursday in the O’Connell Center. 
The junior center scored 10 points, grabbed 
10 rebounds, notched three blocks and tallied three assists in a season-low 22 minutes.
“He just told me that he’s going to punish 
me for the game and teach me a lesson,” Young said. “It definitely worked.”
Citing Young’s disruptive attitude, Donovan 
removed the center from UF’s starting five. 
Scottie Wilbekin stepped into the lineup at 
point guard, starting for the first time this sea-son. 
Donovan demoted Young to Florida’s sec-
ond team during Wednesday’s practice.  
Young checked into the game at the 15:19 
mark of the first half. 
“I feel like my job as a coach is to bring out 
the best in Patric Young as a player,” Donovan said.
Against a deep and physical Marquette 
squad, Florida dove for balls, crashed the boards, drew charges and pinned layups. 
The nation’s No. 2 scoring defense hustled. Florida (6-0) held Marquette (5-2) to 41.2 per -
cent shooting.  
“We were really on our defense [Thursday 
night], because offensively , you’re not always going to make shots,” junior forward Will Yeg-We here at alligatorSports 
Brand Picks Column weren’t the most well-off in the fi-
nancial department to begin with. Then we turned into a bunch of de-generates and bought way too many Powerball tickets on Wednesday night.  
Did we win the lottery? No.
Will we be living like homeless peo-
ple on our road trip to Florida’s bowl game in New Orleans, one of the most fun cities in America? Yes.
Anyone want to spare these sports 
reporters some pocket change so they can experience hand grenades for the first time?  Didn’t think so. 
This week, Josh Jurnovoy and Adam 
Pincus debate the Pac-12 Championship Game between Stanford and UCLA.
Now, onto the picks!
 
UCLA (+9) will punch its lottery 
ticket against Stanford because... 
Beating a team in consecutive weeks 
is hard, and the Bruins get another shot after losing at home last week. In a Pac-12 title matchup more surprising than winning Powerball, UCLA rides run-ning back Johnathan Franklin to a win.
-ADAM PINCUS
The Cardinal (-9) will scratch off a 
win against the Bruins because…
Stanford has hit the jackpot before 
with Andrew Luck. This season, it struck gold on the other side of the ball with its rush defense, which ranks No. 1 in the nation. Franklin might think he’ll keep drawing lucky numbers, but the Cardinal defense will make sure it doesn’t happen. 
 -JOSH JURNOVOY
Leading the way at 65-39 is Rivals’

Although Jennifer George was a 
first-team All-Southeastern Confer -
ence selection in 2012, Big Blue still 
makes her see red. 
In Florida’s 69-66 season-opening 
loss to Michigan last year, George played her least productive game of the season. She played just 25 min-utes and missed her only shot. She also picked up two fouls. 
More than a year later, George 
still has a bad taste in her mouth.  She believes the Gators should have defeated the Wolverines.
“My performance just was not 
very good,” George said. “I defi-nitely have a chip on my shoulder. I have to redeem myself.”
George will have her chance for 
redemption Saturday as Florida (5-2) travels to Ann Arbor to face Michigan (5-2) at 2 p.m. in the Cris-ler Center. 
UF will be looking to earn its 
first victory in a true road game this season. Florida lost 98-67 at Florida State on Nov. 15. 
Coach Amanda Butler said she 
expects more from her team — es-pecially George, the team’s only se-nior. 
“[George] played a really good 
game against Florida State in some very adverse conditions,” Butler said. “Other than that, I think she has been a little bit less than what she’s capable of, but I think she knows that.”
George averages a team-leading 
13.5 points and 7.5 rebounds per game this season. In 2011-12, she paced the Gators with 12.8 points and 8.8 rebounds per game.
George’s rebounding is down, 
and Butler said she is looking to see improvement in that area.  
Though the scoring numbers are 
similar, defenses have caused prob-lems for George by targeting her this season.  
As a junior, George exceeded ex-
pectations. In 33 games, she notched 15 double-doubles — the eighth-most in a season in school history. 
Opponents are focused on stop-
ping her this season. Butler said UF’s best player will have to fight through the increased attention. “People are game planning for 
her,” Butler said. “That doesn’t mean she needs to shoot less or expect less. She just has to have a mindset of readiness for that and handle it and adjust to whatever they’re doing.”
Defenses have frequently dou-
ble-teamed and occasionally triple-teamed George this season. 
Redshirt freshman Carlie Nee-
dles spent last year on the bench af-ter suffering a torn ACL during the preseason. Though she didn’t play , Needles remembers UF’s frustra-tions after losing to Michigan.Needles said each of the return-
ing players wants to make amends for last season’s loss. 
“We know what happened last 
year and how we didn’t come ready to play,” Needles said. “There’s al-ways a payback for a team that you lose to.” 
Though Butler does not want her 
players to place excessive emphasis on one game, she realizes the added motivation may be the push George needs to begin reaching her poten-tial.
“The best is yet to come for Jenni-
fer,” Butler said. “Her performance last year (against Michigan) — hope-fully that will be a little bit more fuel on the fire for her.”  FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 19

Florida’s swimming and 
diving programs have had 
very different seasons. 
The men’s team has soaked 
up the spotlight, posting an undefeated record through five meets. 
At the All Florida Invita-
tional on Sept. 28, UF claimed the first of its two victories against FSU.  
But being ranked No. 2 
doesn’t matter much to the men. 
“It’s nice to read, but it 
doesn’t really mean anything at this point in the season,” sophomore Matt Elliot said. 
Meanwhile, the women’s 
team has fallen short in four of its six meets, with its only wins being the All-Florida Invitational and a dual-meet against South Carolina. 
Junior Brad deBorde said 
he’s tried to motivate the women’s team by establish-ing himself as a vocal leader. 
“I don’t think they’re wor -
ried about having their heads down,” he said. “This is just a stepping stone for them to get better. At the end of the day, it’s only about the end of the year.” 
He said the women’s 
team’s youth could be a cause for their slow start. 
“Disappointment obvi-
ously sets in, but you don’t want to show it,” associate head coach Anthony Nesty said.  
Staying positive is key, 
Nesty said. 
For senior Jamie Bohu-nicky, staying positive has been an issue. 
Bohunicky said she is 
worried about her future, which she hopes includes law school. 
Her apprehensions have 
led to a difficult season in the pool.
She said at times she has 
been “going through the mo-tions.”  
The women’s team also 
needs to block out fatigue in order to succeed, she said. 
“ Y o u 
should not let your 
tiredness be an excuse,” Bohunicky said. “You s h o u l d n ’ t let it get the 
best of you.” 
She believes Florida 
“should be able to dig down deeper” because of the way the team trains. 
Bohunicky is confident in 
her team’s ability to turn the season around. 
The men and women will 
head to Columbus, Ohio, to compete in the Ohio State In-vitational on Friday. 
The meet will last three 
days. For the men, it’s a chance to tack on another victory. 
For the women, it’s a 
chance to set the tone for the second half of the season. 
“It’ll be a little elevated,” 
deBorde said of the talent the Gators will face. “It’ll be tough for us to compete with them. I think we’re ready to face that challenge.”Gators’ men thriving 
as women struggle during fall seasonswimming AnD DiVing
Elliot
uete said. 
“Coach [Billy Donovan] is really trying to make us 
guard every time, every single day in practice. We did a 
really good job staying focused.”
UF eliminated Marquette’s offensive balance. The 
Golden Eagles came into Thursday’s game averaging 76.5 points per game. 
Aside from guard Vander Blue (20 points), no Gold-
en Eagle scored more than six points. Florida held Mar -
quette’s leading scorer, 6-foot-8, 290-pound forward Da-vante Gardner, to six points and one rebound. 
The Gators had balanced scoring, with six players in 
double-figure points.  
Guard Michael Frazier II gave UF a boost off the 
bench. 
The freshman guard scored a team-high 17 points and 
made five of his eight three-pointers, including four in the first half. 
“I don’t really know when I started feeling it,” Frazier 
said. “I kept shooting when I was open. My teammates did a great job of feeding me, and shots just went down.”
Yeguete and Casey Prather each chipped in 11 points for the Gators. 
Senior guard Kenny Boynton, Florida’s leading scorer 
with 16.2 points per game before Thursday’s contest, had a quiet night offensively, scoring six points on 2-of-11 shooting. 
The contest was a rematch of last year’s Sweet 16. The 
Gators defeated the Golden Eagles 68-58 in that game to advance to the Elite Eight.
Both teams were both sloppy on offense during the 
opening minutes. 
During the first 10 minutes, the teams shot a combined 
12 for 27 from the field.
Florida used an 8-0 run late in the first half to enter 
halftime with a 38-24 lead. 
UF held the Golden Eagles to 37.9 percent shooting in 
the first period. 
The Gators opened the second half with a 9-0 run to 
put the contest out of reach.
UF’s 6-0 start is Donovan’s fifth in his 17-year tenure 
with the Gators. 
“[Marquette is] a good team, but it’s still November, 
and there’s time to grow and develop,” Donovan said.  “It’s a good thing we play these kinds of games, but I’m not so sure we’re that many points better than every-body.”“Taylor has done a tremendous 
job handling the pressure of adjust-
ing to a new school, a new system and new teammates,” Mann said. “She’s definitely ... one of our best assets that we’ve had this year, and we’re so grateful for her.”
Before Brauneis gets the ball to 
point scorers like Mann and Recek, Unroe has to transfer hard-hit at-tacks into hittable balls for Braun-eis.
The sophomore from Muncie, 
Ind., has anchored the back-line defense with her 4.43 digs per set — the fifth-best mark in the confer -ence. 
Last year, Unroe finished with 
3.69 digs per set. 
Her service aces per set average 
has improved from .27 last year to .33 this season.
“For Taylor Unroe, she’s on the 
floor five and a half of the six rotations, she an-chors our serve-receive, but the part of her game that has im-
proved so much, especially in the 
last month, has been her floor de-fense,” Wise said. 
“The last weekend of the regu-lar season, she put together back-to-back really good matches in terms of not just number of digs, but also quality of digs.”
With the Golden Hurricanes 
boasting the all-time leading scor -
er in NCAA history — senior Tyler Henderson — Wise said Unroe and her defense will have their work cut out for them in the first round of the tournament. 
Wise is 21-0 in opening-round 
games during her career at Flori-da.
“That’s a pretty tough match-
up to have in the first round, and I think our fans are in for a treat to see one of the country’s best,” Wise said.
In second at 61-43 is The Miami Herald’s Matt “You hurt my 
feelings” Watts, who got into a spat with a stranger on Facebook 
and, for once, didn’t get the last word in. It’s OK, V8KLLR. 
Just behind at 60-44 is alligatorSports editor Greg “NOT MY 
BLANKIE, YOU GUYS” Luca, who went all Linus van Pelt on his roommates when he found his blanket in the middle of the living room floor. Relax, Luca. Just keep sucking your thumb. Mommy’s almost done washing your blankie-poo. 
Still in the hunt at 58-46 is The Associated Press’ Mark 
“Khan-spiracy theorist” Long, who was stoking a potential conspiracy theory with the Jaguars — OK, just stop, Mark. We know it’s your job and all, but NOBODY CARES. JESUS.
In fifth at 56-48 is the Palm Beach Post’s Jason “Sleeping 
like a Baby Back” Lieser, whose cure for any illness is a rack of ribs and some NyQuil. We’re not doctors, but that combo just doesn’t sound safe. Good luck.
Tied with Jason is alligatorSports writer Josh “I’m objective, 
damn it!” Jurnovoy, who recently got some flack from his frat buddies for being too down on the Gators. Just admit it, dude. You were wrong. Oh, wait. You did. 
Avoiding the cellar at 53-51 is alligatorSports assistant editor 
Joe “Ain’t nobody fresher than my clique” Morgan, who swags around the office spitting rap lyrics as if an Atlanta Braves hat isn’t his only connection to rap culture. Plus, we’ve seen you and your clique. Just about everybody is fresher.
And in dead-ass last place with a piss-poor record of 48-56 
is alligatorSports writer Adam “Jackpot!” Pincus, who won a Powerball of his own when he found half-eaten bag of peanut M&M’s. Every man’s trash is Pincus’s treasure.20, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 2012
