David Morrison, a 19-year old applied 
physiology and kinesiology sophomore at UF, 
planned to celebrate with friends on the ﬁ  rst Friday of classes, but he found himself passed out on his couch with muscle aches and pains instead.
Morrison, along with multiple students 
across UF, has already caught the ﬂ  u.
Inﬂ  uenza, also known as the ﬂ  u, is a conta-
gious viral infection of the respiratory passag-es, typically causing muscle aches and pains along with a fever.
Though Alachua County’s inﬂ  uenza state is 
currently mild, inﬂ  uenza across Florida is con-sidered widespread, said Catherine Seemann, advertising, marketing and media coordinator for the Student Health Care Center.
Thirty-eight Florida counties have reported 
mild activity and 20 have reported moderate, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Activity levels refer to geo-graphic spread, not the severity of the illness, New year

Fiol, 19, dressed the part — hammer and all — as Thor at the 
Reitz Union Sunday.
Outﬁ  tted in plastic armor and helmet, Fiol became a mag-
net for pictures with Thor fans during the second-annual SwampCon this weekend.“They’re like, ‘Oh, it’s Thor,’ and I’m like ‘Yep, that’s my 
name,’” Fiol said. “They don’t even know it’s my real name.”
The two-day event featured science ﬁ  ction, comic book 
and anime panels, as well as gaming tournaments and cos-tume contests.Registration lines snaked around the second ﬂ  oor of the 
Reitz Union hours before the event began at about noon Sat-urday. By 4:30 p.m. on Saturday, about 2,000 people had reg-istered for the event.

A man wanted out of Levy 
County on multiple gun posses-
sion and drug charges was arrest-ed Friday afternoon in northwest Gainesville.
The U.S. Marshals Florida Re-
gional Fugitive Task Force charged Bryan Greenlee, 36, of Gainesville, with four counts of possession of a ﬁ  rearm by a convicted felon, pos-session/sale/delivery of a ﬁ  rearm with a serial number removed, pos-session of cocaine with intent to sell and possession of cannabis, accord-ing to a U.S. Marshals news release.
The task force’s investigation 
began in 2012, when the Levy County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce issued an arrest warrant for Greenlee when deputies learned 
he was in pos-session of a Ru-ger Mini-14 riﬂ  e, Glock 21.45-cali-ber handgun, .22-caliber pistol and .22-caliber riﬂ  e, according to the release.
Greenlee was previously ar-rested for grand theft auto and co-caine possession, according to the Florida Department of Corrections’ website.
At about 2 p.m. Friday, ofﬁ  cials 
spotted Greenlee at an ex-girl-friend’s house, located in the 1500 block of Northwest 54th Drive.
Task force members and a 
Gainesville Police K-9 unit sur-rounded the house and ordered Greenlee to come out.
Greenlee complied and ofﬁ  cers 
arrested him without incident, ac-cording to the release.
Police later booked him into the 
Alachua County Jail at 3:45 p.m. Friday. 
As of Sunday night, he remained 
in custody with a $235,000 bond.

A UF engineering professor 
began research to develop a hy-brid mass transit vehicle. V ernon P . Roan planned to buy a com-mercially available motor home and strip it down to meet his specifications. He hoped to de-velop a bus with little pollution and more efficient fuel use with the aid of his own generator set, seats, safety system and decor.
Jan. 14, 1982UF dorm residents faced rent 
hikes and possible relocation. UF Housing Director James Grimm expected dorm fees to increase by about 8 or 12 percent starting in the 1982 Summer semester. He also said the estimated 3,700 resi-dents would take part in a lottery to determine who would fill the 2,700 available spaces the follow-ing Fall.

Some dreams can last more 
than a lifetime.
The Martin Luther King Jr. cel-
ebration began on Sunday night 
and will continue until Jan. 22, with some events lasting after the holiday.
The nine days will feature 
guest speakers, a youth talent show, a drug abuse and AIDS awareness program, a spelling bee and, of course, celebrations honoring Martin Luther King Jr.
Rodney Long, president of the 
Martin Luther King Jr. Commis-sion of Florida, said this year’s festivities will focus on the activ-ist’s life and celebrate his birth.
Long said the youth oratorical 
contest is one of the new events this year. He said the contestants’ speeches focus on what King’s dream meant to them.
On Tuesday , the oratorical 
contest and gospel concert will begin at 6:30 p.m. at the Ignite Faith Center, according to a press release.
Throughout the week, many 
of the events will take place at the Martin Luther King Multi-Purpose Center, located at 1028 NE 14th St.An educational workshop 
about the sealing of court records will begin at 6 p.m. Wednesday, followed by the Black History Cultural Brain Bowl and Spelling Bee on Thursday at 6 p.m., ac-cording to the release.
On Friday , a youth talent show 
will begin at 7 p.m., and on Satur -
day, an aware-ness program 
about violence, drug abuse and AIDS will be-gin at 10 a.m.
S u n d a y 
and Monday will both fea-ture events 
throughout the day celebrating the life of King and his dream through commemorative pro-grams, marches, gospel programs and awards ceremonies.
“These events are important 
because Dr. King and countless others paid the ultimate sacrifice of their lives so America could progress,” Long said. “It is now time, especially for young people, to commemorate his life and cel-ebrate his birth.”

She said it is impossible to pre-
dict when the flu will hit Gainesville. 
The virus is continuing to increase throughout Florida, and when it hits here, she said, it will spread fast.
As a way to prevent the spread 
of this viral infection, the Student Health Care Center has been giving free flu shots to students since Sep-tember, Seemann said.
Although Morrison got a flu shot 
last year, he didn’t get one this year.
“[The flu shot] was never pre-
sented to me as an option this time around,” he said.
Seemann said students come in 
explaining how the flu has never hit them to the degree they couldn’t move or go to class, but she said they got lucky.
“The flu is unpredictable,” she 
said. “You never know how one strain [of the virus] is going to affect you versus another.”
Nursing student Katherine Behel, 
20, got her shot in September. She said the nursing school requires stu-dents to get shots, but Behel would have gotten one anyway.
Anyone is susceptible to the vi-
rus.
“Not getting a vaccination, you 
put everyone around you at risk,” Seemann said. “There’s a long win-dow where the virus is still conta-gious.”4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, JANUARY 14, 2013

Who,” said 30 percent of those 
attending were from outside of Gainesville. He said most people were UF and Santa Fe College stu-dents, as well as local high school students.
Wasserman said he was pre-
pared to manage a younger crowd by having 18-and-older panels and checking IDs.
He said he was most proud of 
the tabletop board games in the Arredondo Cafe, his own contribu-tion to SwampCon.
Chemical engineering sopho-
more Jon Martin and criminology sophomore Sterling Monroe, both 19, played Scattergories in the Arre-dondo Cafe before attending a His-tory of Zombies panel. Martin said he found out about the convention online and enjoyed the costumes.
“They won’t get the experience 
anywhere else,” Martin said.
Vendors selling pins, posters 
and apparel filled the Reitz Union Colonnade. Larry Scott, 54, from North Carolina, had a table on the colonnade for his store, Tiny-TopHats.net.
Scott gained much attention 
at the convention dressed as the Weeping Angel from “Doctor Who.”  He said the convention was his first in Florida.
“It’s free, which is nice,” Scott 
said. “There’s lots of space, lots of room.”
Telecommunication junior Da-
vid Dulak and psychology junior Erica Orama, both 21, came to SwampCon to “people watch.”
“I’ve never seen so many people 
dressed as different characters,” Dulak said. “It’s like Halloween all over again.”
Dulak and Orama attended 
SwampCon both days and stayed until midnight. The pair met Fiol during SwampCon and attended panels together.
“I definitely feel less nerdy than 
I normally do,” Fiol said.
“It’s good to know we’re not 
alone,” Orama said.

Kella and Aiden Sowder didn’t know 
rising before the sun would land them in 
the slammer.
But instead of sitting in solitary confine-
ment, the 3- and 6-year-old siblings played with echoes and dusty chalkboards as they trotted along a public tour with their father, Fred Sowder, of the former Gainesville Correctional Institution Saturday.
In an effort to gauge the public’s interest 
toward purchasing and using the former jail as a multipurpose community center, the City of Gainesville and other partners invited the public to take a tour through the vacant buildings.
About 150 people attended, including 
City Commissioner Randy Wells, who said transforming the former jail can offer a place for job skill training, education and small business development.
“I think our responsibility is to address 
the values and concerns of our communi-ty,” Wells said.
He said the city wants to purchase the 
16-acre property and an additional 55 acres.
With the purchase, the facility would 
include an aquaculture pond, additional buildings, recreation fields and buffer lands, which can be used as a laboratory for forestry and agriculture projects.Theresa Lowe, director of the 
Gainesville/Alachua County Office on Homelessness, prepared groups for the tour in the former prison’s visitors center.
She said she could envision the facility 
used as a place for innovation, offering job hunting services, culinary classes, day care and shelter.
“When it’s fully finished, I see it as a 
place where people can come to get em-powered,” Lowe said. “With this, we can lift people out of poverty. We can prevent homelessness, and if we can prevent home-lessness, then we can end homelessness.”
Lowe said part of the reason for hold-
ing a public tour was to get usage ideas but also to let citizens know what’s going on in their town.
Sowder, a vice chair on the city’s Arts 
and Cultural Affairs Board, said an artistic renovation to the building could bring the old facility back to life.
“We could have artists paint murals and 
rehabilitate the buildings — spruce up the place, at the very least,” he said.
Until the purchase, the former prison 
will remain vacant.
Wells said he hopes city and county res-
idents will contribute to the project.
“We’re very open to ideas that can help 
this community over time,” he said. “We want to have a broad vision.”

Your car might not be the 
only thing that’s automatic at 
your next trip to the DMV .
Democratic Florida Sen. Jeff 
Clemens, of Lake Worth, filed a bill Wednesday that would pro-vide for automatic voter registra-tion when eligible U.S. citizens complete a driver’s license or identification card application, renew their license or change their address.
Employees will be required to 
notify each person that they are transferring their information to a new application or updating an existing record. 
People who do not wish to 
register can opt out.
Through automatic registra-
tion, Clemens hopes to make the process less complicated for both election supervisors, who he said spend too much time verifying registration informa-tion, and voters, according to a Florida Senate Minority Office press release.
The bill is expected to be dis-
cussed during the 2013 legislative session, which will begin March 
5. Clemens could not be reached for further com-ment.
A l a c h u a 
County Su-
pervisor of E l e c t i o n s Pam Carpen-
ter said the bill sounded like an interesting idea. 
However, she said she is con-
cerned about automatic registra-tion for state residents who have no contact with the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.  
She said her office puts voter 
registration forms in places like libraries, Walmart and Publix to reach these individuals, particu-larly those without computers.
“If the legislature is going to 
set up a way to have citizens au-tomatically register to vote, they would have to set it up in a way that would make it accessible to everyone,” she said. “This would be a first step.”
Hannah Warshowsky , a 
20-year-old psychology sopho-more, said she thinks the bill will make a bigger difference in the community beyond the UF campus. 
“There’s never a point where 
it’s too easy ,” she said. “This just sounds really efficient.”
Alex Meckley , a 21-year-old 
family , youth and community sciences junior agreed, saying the bill will make registration more effective.
“I think registration should 
be easy because it’s something that makes such a big impact on our society ,” she said. “I feel like people would be more prone to vote because they didn’t have to do the extra work.”

There’s no need to worry about shipping prices for on-
line items. Target is now price-matching items from Ama-
zon.com and other retailers throughout the year.
The company announced a new policy Tuesday, saying 
customers will be able to receive lower prices on in-store items if they are sold cheaper on a competitor’s website.
Accepted online competitor prices include Amazon.
com, Walmart.com, BestBuy.com and Toysrus.com, ac-cording to a company press release.
Carrie Arnold, an executive team leader at the Target 
at 3970 SW Archer Road, said the store started using the program exclusively during the holiday season, which helped drive sales. 
During the holidays, customers mainly used the pro-
gram on video games and electronics, especially iPads, Arnold said.
The policy allows more options for price-matching, she 
said.
Customers must request the price match at a store’s 
guest services desk, according to the release.
The model number of the selected item and the com-
petitor’s cheaper price must be legitimate, Arnold said.
“We have a special application to see if the price match 
is valid,” she said.Not worrying about shipping is a plus for Andre Or -
tega.
“I think you can get around shipping cost,” the 20-year-
old applied physiology and kinesiology junior said, “be-cause that’s the kicker.”
Arnold said this is another way for Target to “continue 
to make this a one-stop shop” in Gainesville, and she ex-pects local retailers to follow suit.MONDAY, JANUARY 14, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

White House responds 
to Death Star petition
You hear a lot of doom and gloom these days regarding the 
general strength and fortitude of our government.
There’s, like, a ton of stuff going on behind closed 
doors, we’re sure, that should make all of us slightly suspicious at all times. But if we walked around like that all the time, then we’d never get anything done.
It’s best to not think about how weirdly powerful some peo-
ple actually are. Every once in a while, though, the government does something awesome instead.
In November 2012, someone created a petition titled “Secure 
resources and funding, and begin construction of a Death Star by 2016.”
The description: “By focusing our defense resources into 
a space-superiority platform and weapon system such as a Death Star, the government can spur job creation in the ﬁ  elds of construction, engineering, space exploration, and more, and strengthen our national defense.”
It earned a total of more than 34,000 signatures. That many 
signatures (at least 25,000 in 30 days) means the president’s of-ﬁ  ce will take a look at it. And, boy, did it.
The title of the White House’s response: “This Isn’t the Peti-
tion Response You’re Looking For.” Right away we’re in love. It was written by Paul Shawcross, Chief of the Science and Space Branch at the White House Ofﬁ  ce of Management and Budget. Real dorky.
The response lays out some pretty logical points about why 
the government can’t just build a Death Star. 
“The construction of the Death Star has been estimated to 
cost more than $850,000,000,000,000,000. We’re working hard to reduce the deﬁ  cit, not expand it. The Administration does not support blowing up planets. Why would we spend countless taxpayer dollars on a Death Star with a fundamental ﬂ  aw that can be exploited by a one-man starship?”
“If you do pursue a career in a science, technology, engineer-
ing or math-related ﬁ  eld, the Force will be with us!” Shawcross wrote. “Remember, the Death Star’s power to destroy a planet, or even a whole star system, is insigniﬁ  cant next to the power of the Force.”
Good on you, Shawcross. He simultaneously tried to foster 
a healthy connection with the “Star Wars” fandom while he at-tempted to inspire the next generation of scientists.
“We don’t have a Death Star,” said Shawcross, “but we do 
have ﬂ  oating robot assistants on the Space Station, a President who knows his way around a light saber and advanced (marsh-mallow) cannon, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is supporting research on building Luke’s arm, ﬂ  oating droids, and quadruped walkers.”
Let’s take ourselves as seriously as the government takes it-
self; take a scary amount of criticism, then apply a light layer of whimsy.Loganville woman jumped to the gun
We can learn a lot about the problematic illusion-making tendencies of the discourse on guns by an-alyzing a recent news story from Loganville, Ga.
You may have heard about it: A lady was hiding in her 
attic from a burglar with her two kids and her Saturday night special when he used a crowbar to bust in on them. So she did what she had to do. Next thing you know, the creeper with them two feets who came a-creepin’ like a black cat do is on the ﬂ  oor full of .38 holes.
There’s an important aspect of this story I need to draw 
attention to at this point because it perplexes the hell outta me: He didn’t mean to violently intrude upon this family.
The guy shows up knocking at the door, ostensibly to sell 
them some encyclopedias or crowbars or something.
No answer. So he rings the doorbell a bunch of times, and 
instead of answering the door or somehow asking him what he wants, they hide and call the cops!
Now that he’s satisﬁ  ed that no one is home, he begins lib-
erating the family’s belongings in the name of the proletariat. Like any good burglar, he’s thorough, working through ev-ery room in the house until he eventually reaches the attic.
He opens the door, and suddenly a relatively harmless cat 
burglary becomes a violent home invasion.
Those with a pro-gun stance paraded this story as an ex-
ample of why passing gun control legislation would be worse for America than a gay marriage between President Barack Obama and Michael Moore held on the steps of the Capitol where both tuxedos are made entirely from marijuana and birth control pills.
Self-defense is a legitimate thing; there are certain human 
instincts that encourage self-preservation rather than lengthy reﬂ  ection and discussion of motives.
Or as Lao Tzu so wisely wrote, “Shoot ﬁ  rst, ask questions 
later.”
The problematic part of how this scenario played out is 
not what she did in the heat of that moment. I just want to know why she didn’t, you know, answer the door in the ﬁ  rst place.
C’mon, you gotta at least open a window and ask the 
dude what he wants!Obviously I’m not saying she 
deserved to have her house bro-ken into.
You can try to justify her in 
hindsight by saying, “Well, he just got out of jail in August, and he’s been arrested six times since 2008, so she had a right to be scared of him.” But she couldn’t have known that!
Unless the news left out the part where he yelled about 
his time in Folsom or the fact that his T-shirt said, “Ask me about jail!” there wasn’t a real reason for her to be scared of him initially, other than the same reason she bought the gun in the ﬁ  rst place.
She’s been so conditioned by the stories of murders and 
home invasions that populate the evening news that she immediately went into xenophobia-induced panic mode as soon as someone whose appearance was mildly threatening intruded into her comfort zone.
This lady is being rightfully praised as a hero for protect-
ing her family in the face of danger.
From all appearances, this guy was trying to ﬁ  nd an EMP-
TY house to break into. If she had initially responded proac-tively by confronting him when he was a random, annoying guy hanging around ringing the doorbell incessantly, there’s a nonzero chance he would’ve just made up some excuse and moved on.
Instead she acted in an inexplicably irrational and para-
noid way. Now he’s badly wounded, maybe dying, and her kids had to watch their mother repeatedly shoot a man while he begged her, crying, to stop.
Maybe guns are good, maybe they’re bad, but this story 
should’ve never gotten to the point where they were in-volved.  
Sometimes it’s easier to ask someone just what the hell 
they think they’re doing rather than wait for them to do it.

I wasn’t particularly popular in grade school. Con-
sumed with academics, I disengaged from the so-cial hierarchy, not consciously, but because there 
were always other things to worry about. I ﬂ  oated around the social ladder but never stayed on one rung too long.
In grade school, there were fewer social niches to 
inhabit, and accruing popularity points was a full-time job. In middle and high school, everyone was keenly aware of where everyone else ﬁ  t in the social landscape, and they were lying if they told you oth-erwise. Everyone was dying to reach an imaginary social ideal built by the students. Perception was ev-erything.
College has been a breath of fresh air for me.I have many friends who classify themselves as 
nerds, and they all seem to report the same feelings: The majority of grade school was a criminal waste of time and a frustrating crapshoot. College is less 
isolating, more rewarding and generally a better place to be.
Of course, there was the 
occasional teacher who made things worthwhile, but in gen-
eral, the monotony of American schools brings no end in misery for the classic nerd.
For the nerd, self-achievement is everything.In his 2003 essay, “Why Nerds are Unpopular,” 
Paul Graham explains that nerds don’t just want to be smart and do well in school.
“[I wanted] to design beautiful rockets, or to write 
well, or to understand how to program computers,” he wrote. “In general, to make great things.”
“You have no idea the hell I climbed out of to come 
here,” an acquaintance humored me on his admis-sion to the Computer-Based Honors Program at the University of Alabama. He was a quirky, intelligent guy whom I often spotted eating alone in the dining halls my freshman year. He was a natural introvert, and he liked it. He could do what he pleased in col-lege, pursuing a major he loved within a culture that rewarded difference and ingenuity.
There is more of an incentive to be a hardwork-
ing, motivated, intellectually engaged, self-directed student in college.
“Nerd” is no longer a derogatory term. Preferring 
knowledge to social dominance is not a bad thing. For the nerds, it does get better. You just have to wait it out and have enough self-conﬁ  dence to ﬁ  nd your niche.

UWireIf the question sounds dramatic, allow me to elucidate.
The most recently adjourned congressional body, 
steeped in fringe politics and partisan interests, could 
barely perform its fundamental civic duty of voting on and 
passing laws. It was the most inefﬁ  cient and unproductive Congress ever, compromising the least to consider the few-est bills while enacting even fewer — many of which were routine or mundane matters like reapproving administrative procedures or formally naming post ofﬁ  ces. Meanwhile, the U.S. Postal Service hangs on the brink of bankruptcy.
A Senate that is constitutionally sanctioned to form its 
own rules and procedures has embraced obstructionism to inﬂ  uence lawmaking in the form of the ﬁ  libuster. So long as someone keeps talking no one has to worry about actually passing laws. The Senate does not have to do its job.
Congress allegedly serves ordinary citizens in matters of 
law, but our representatives have focused mostly on promot-ing themselves, kowtowing to deep pockets and special in-terests in a perpetual effort to stay in ofﬁ  ce.
Lobbying has become an extensive industry with a re-
volving door plainly situated between the public and private sectors.
Even if a cabal of billionaires were ultimately unable to 
purchase the presidency for their fanatical free-market dar-ling, it is no less assuring that President Barack Obama’s greatest ﬁ  nancial supporters — including Hollywood and the banking industry — beneﬁ  ted from considerable tax breaks embedded in the recent Band-Aid legislation ad-dressing the ”ﬁ  scal cliff.” Meanwhile, taxes increased for just about everyone while essentially nothing was done to curb an unsustainable, decade-long federal spending spree.
Tax breaks for corporations are one thing, but exonera-
tion for clear criminal activity is another entirely. I could face life in prison for distributing cocaine just once at Dartmouth. British bank HSBC knowingly helped Mexican drug cartels launder billions of dollars through the U.S. banking system over the course of a decade. The Department of Justice slapped the bank with a hefty ﬁ  ne but refused to pursue criminal charges, citing fears of destabilizing the global ﬁ  nancial system.
First they were too big to fail. Now they are too big to 
jail.
While innocent moviegoers and schoolchildren are 
gunned down, our nation defers to a vaguely worded pas-sage in a 200-year-old document, as if our nation’s founders had prophesied the development and proliferation of lethal-ly accurate, high-powered hunting riﬂ  es when crafting the Bill of Rights.
Maybe instead of jury-rigging legal arguments to stay in 
line with some constitutional precedent, we need to recon-sider the Constitution itself.
I acknowledge that mine is an audacious suggestion. To 
be clear, I fully appreciate the ingenuity of our founders’ cre-ation and do not propose a complete overhaul. But the idea that the social, cultural and political environment in which our Constitution was created would yield solutions that re-main eternally relevant in an increasingly complex and inter-connected world is absurd. The Founders may have known this. Article V allows for the ratiﬁ  cation of individual con-stitutional amendments, and more radically , the formation of a constitutional convention to propose and enact multiple amendments at once.
The need for such a convention and a comprehensive re-
formulation of a systemically problematic political system is inevitable. That may come two or two thousand years in the future, but in light of recent events, the conversation is war-ranted right now.

When it comes to e-readers, the consen-
sus on owning a device is that it’s conve-
nient. 
But convenience may not be enough to 
wipe out print books forever.
According to a 2012 report from Bowk-
er, a worldwide provider of bibliographic information, print books are here to stay despite the increase in popularity of e-book readers such as the Kindle, iPad and other tablets.
The Bowker study showed that in 
America, 4 percent more women use e-readers than men.
A study published from the Pew Re-
search Center in 2012 showed that 72 per -
cent of American adults during the previ-ous year had read a print book, compared with the 17 percent of adults who read e-books.
It also reported 81 percent of respond-
ers said they prefer to read print books with children.
About 70 percent said they prefer to 
share physical books with other people.
Although readers can hold their entire 
book collections on one device, Jan Fronk, owner of Book Gallery West, a new and used bookstore located in the Millhopper Shopping Center, said her customers still enjoy reading physical books.“What people keep telling us is that 
they love the feel of having a book in their hands,” Fronk said.Kristen Zych, a 22-year-old physics se-
nior, said she bought a Nook Simple Touch so she could read “A Feast for Crows,” the fourth book in a seven-part series. At 1,104 pages, it weighs a pound.
“I didn’t want to carry around this se-
ries of books,” she said.
Celina Rodriguez, a 20-year-old biol-
ogy junior, said she bought a tablet to use for class. 
She uses it as an e-reader on long car 
rides because she can travel with a lot of books and no bulk.
Though she reads on her tablet often, 
Rodriguez said she also enjoys reading print books, especially books by some of her favorite authors, J.K. Rowling and Chuck Palahniuk.
“You read books to not be on the com-
puter,” she said. “I think print books will never go out of style. They have been here forever.”
Casey Robbins, a 24-year-old clerk at 
Book Gallery West, said she owns two e-readers but does not use them often. 
She only uses the devices for periodi-
cals and books she can get for free.
“People that read both are way more 
prevalent than people who only read e-books,” Roberts said. “Books will be here well into the future.”8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, JANUARY 14, 2013

Kristopher McCullough hovered 
over a table crowded with “Star 
Trek” figurines, model spaceships and DVDs.
Clad in a maroon and black 
V oyager uniform, the 35-year-old Subway employee recalled his 10th birthday, when he received his first Star Trek item: a model of the Star -
ship Enterprise.
Since then, his passion for the series has only grown. On Saturday, McCullough shared his collection with thousands of people at the 34th Annual Collectors Day at the Florida Museum of Natural History.
Tiffany Ireland, education as-
sistant for the museum, said about 1,500 people attended Saturday’s event, where more than 60 hobbyists laid out their collections on tables.
From chess sets to bonsai plants 
to brass toasting forks, each pre-senter had his or her own reasons for collecting.
For John Puckett, collecting busi-
ness cards is not only a hobby but a passion. The 65-year-old retired Lowe’s Home Improvement em-ployee said he has been collecting cards since the mid-1960s.
Puckett’s extensive collection in-
cludes cards fashioned out of metal, wood, leather and plastic. He also has a blue-and-white Microsoft card from Bill Gates and a gold-embossed card from Donald Trump.Puckett said he likes to see how 
people’s minds work and how cre-ative they can get with their card designs.
“Everyone’s trying to come up 
with a card that people won’t throw away,” he said.
At one point, Puckett said, he had 
more than 1 million cards, which led him to downsize his collection to 400,000 cards. Puckett cautions aspiring collectors to be sure they are comfortable with the items they plan on collecting.
“It’s like getting a tattoo,” he 
said. “Make sure you really want to collect it because you’re going to be stuck with it.”
Some collections can start entire-
ly on accident.
One day at work, Puckett’s wife, 
Cindy Puckett, 60, displayed a purple hippopotamus on her desk. Overzealous co-workers thought she collected hippos and began bringing her purple hippo pillows, bath toys, key chains and tape dis-pensers, John Puckett said.
“Now, it’s gone out of control,” 
he said. “You’ll think you have ev-erything purple hippo, but then an-other one will show up.”

UF’s College of Journalism and Com-
munications is one of the first schools to 
debut a new master’s program focused on social media.
Spiro Kiousis, director of distance edu-
cation at the journalism school, wrote in an email that factors such as industry de-mands, student desires for the subject and UF’s strengths in digital communication and research went into the decision to start the program.
The online program takes as little as 18 
months to complete. It is aimed at working professionals, so that they can take what they learn and apply it to their current job.  
Recruitment for the inaugural class be-
gan earlier this month, Kiousis said. 
Applicants should have two years of relevant professional communications ex-perience, a 3.0 undergraduate GPA and three letters of recommendation, among other requirements.
Classes start this summer and last 12 
weeks. 
Students can take up to three classes at 
a time, according to a program brochure. 
Students in the program can choose to 
graduate with a certificate or master’s de-gree in social media.
Steve Johnson, who teaches social me-
dia reporting, said journalists could use social media to create content, or they could aggregate information about their audience.
Although the program is designed for 
professionals, Johnson said recent gradu-ates could also benefit from the classes.
“Social media is nothing new,” he said. 
“Technology is the new part.”UF offers new master’s for

Students might want to invest in bug 
spray. The nationwide School of Ants has 
come to UF.
The ant school relies on citizen science, 
a project where people all over the coun-try collect data from their own backyard to send to experts for review.
Andrea Lucky, head of the School of 
Ants and assistant research scientist in the UF Department of Entomology and Nem-atology, said about 1,000 samples have been sent to the school, which has helped monitor new species and see if they are expanding.
Lucky said more than 100 people have 
gotten involved with the project.
“A lot of people have responded by get-
ting interested in critters that live in and around their yards,” she said. “Some peo-ple have been responsible for discovering new ranges for problematic species.”
Since Lucky took a position at UF in 
Fall 2012, the original ant school, based 
at North Carolina State University, will now share its headquarters at UF.
“It’s important to 
know that anyone can participate,” Lucky said.

�BROWZINE IS AVAILABLE 
AS A TRIAL UNTIL JAN. 31.

Alligator Staff Writer
UF is trying out a new 
iPad app, free to students, 
that could make academic re-search a far less cumbersome experience.
BrowZine, available as 
a trial for all students and faculty until Jan. 31, lets its users browse, sort and save scholarly and peer-reviewed articles on the go. Once re-trieved and saved, an article can be accessed without the need of an Internet connec-tion.
“Depending on the feed-
back, we’ll stick with the ser -
vice,” said Denise Bennett, a librarian at the Marston Sci-ence Library.
Anyone who has the app 
is given a link to the survey. It can be accessed directly at www.guides.uflib.ufl.edu/browzine.
BrowZine is sold only to 
institutions, and UF is one of about 20 colleges currently testing the service. Others have already become sub-scribers since its release in October, including Loyola University Chicago, Univer -
sity of Minnesota and Johns Hopkins University.
“So far, feedback has been 
positive,” Bennett said.
The trial period ends this 
month, after which it will be decided whether UF will be-come a subscriber.
The service most favors 
people who are familiar with using scholarly articles on a regular basis.
“We can’t really foresee 
undergrads getting much use out of it,” Bennett said, “only staff and research fel-lows, people who have spe-cific journals and like to fol-low them.”
Such is the case for Fiona 
Foley, a first-year law stu-dent.
“The mobility would 
change how I can do re-search, if they have the right journals,” she said as she hefted the edge of the book on her Library West table and let it fall.
Foley doesn’t own an iPad, but there are plenty of journals available through the service.
Kendall Bartsch, CEO of 
Third Iron, BrowZine’s de-veloper, said there are cur -
rently “more than 2,000” published journals accessible via the service, and thou-sands more will be added by the end of January.
When rental iPads become 
available in Library West, Fo-ley could be the one to install the app, as there are no ex-plicit plans to preinstall the program on the Library West iPads. Whether renters can sync the saved articles on a shared device or even install it themselves is up in the air because the terms of the iPad rental agreement are still be-ing determined, according to the Library West circulation desk.
BrowZine is currently 
only available through the official Apple App Store. Bartsch said an Android version is in the works and slated for release by the end of March.

 �NO. 9 TENNESSEE WON 78-75.
PHILLIP HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer 
 
Coach Amanda Butler had her team on 
the brink of upsetting No. 9 Tennessee on 
Sunday afternoon, a victory that would have represented arguably Florida’s big-gest win during her tenure.
She then made her most critical mistake 
of the game in overtime. 
With less than half a minute remain-
ing in the extra period and the score tied at 75, Butler instructed Carlie Needles to foul Tennessee’s Kamiko Williams, sending her to the free-throw line. 
Williams, a 64 percent free-throw shoot-
er coming into the game, made 1 of 2, giv-ing Tennessee a one-point advantage with 24 seconds remaining.
Despite two chances in the waning sec-
onds, Florida (13-5, 2-2 Southeastern Con-ference) could not score and its upset was thwarted in a 78-75 loss to the V olunteers on Sunday in the O’Connell Center. 
“It was one of those calculated risk sort 
of things, and it was a bad decision,” But-ler said after the game. “Even though [Wil-liams] only hit one, it still was a bad deci-sion. …  She was one of their weaker free throw shooters, and sometimes, you just have a feeling. If I had it to do over again, I’d trust our defense.” 
Christin Mercer had the opportunity to offset Butler’s miscue but missed two free throws with nine seconds remaining.

The Gators were already playing a 
man down in Baton Rouge, La. 
Redshirt senior guard Mike Rosario 
didn’t dress in No. 11 Florida’s 74-52 
win against LSU on Saturday due to a sprained left ankle he suffered during Wednesday’s 77-44 win against Georgia in the O’Connell Center. 
But with less than two minutes left 
in the first half, the Gators lost another player.
After Kenny Boynton missed a three 
with 1:46 left in the half, Casey Prather jumped up to grab the offensive rebound, landed and barely beat the shot clock with his layup to put Florida up 25-20. 
Prather then hobbled down the court 
and hunched over to grab his left ankle when he got there.

Kenny Boynton continues to shatter UF 
scoring records.  
Two games after breaking Lee Hum-
phrey’s record for career three-pointers at 
Florida (290), Boynton surpassed Erving Walker and Udonis Haslem on Saturday for No. 3 on UF’s all-time scoring list with 1,782 career points.
The senior guard’s team-high 20 points 
propelled No. 11 Florida (12-2, 2-0 South-eastern Conference) to a 74-52 victory against LSU in the Pete Maravich Assem-bly Center in Baton Rouge, La.
After making a free throw at the 3:16 mark in the second half, Boynton passed Walker (1,777 points), his backcourt part-ner for three seasons at Florida.
Then with 1:04 remaining, Boynton 
drilled a three-pointer to climb ahead of Haslem (1,781). Boynton now sits behind only Ronnie Williams (2,090) and Andrew Moten (1,930).
In 35 minutes against the Tigers, Boyn-
ton scored 20 points on 7-of-13 shooting and made 4 of 8 three-point field goal at-tempts. The senior guard also grabbed seven boards. 
Boynton has averaged 17.3 points in 
the past four games. During five contests before the recent stretch, he averaged only 8.6 points on 25.5 percent shooting and a 12.5 percent clip from behind the arc. 
“I put those games behind me,” Boyn-
ton said. “Beginning of the year, I think it was more mental than anything.”
Boynton sparked an undermanned 
Gators squad with 15 points in the second half. Redshirt senior guard Mike Rosario (left ankle) was inactive, and junior forward Casey Prather 
suffered an apparent high left ankle sprain at the 1:38 mark in the first 
half after grabbing an offensive rebound for a putback layup.  
 “I thought it was a gutsy game for our guys, considering we have two older guys not playing in the game,” coach Billy Don-ovan said. “(We were) really relying on six to seven guys to find a way to win on the road.” 
Said Boynton: “If I went down, I’d trust 
that my team would do it without me. It’s really an effort thing with us.”
During Florida’s key 21-5 run, which 
put the Gators up 50-25 with 12:29 remain-ing, Boynton scored a layup and buried two three-pointers.
His 5-of-7 clip in the second half helped 
the Gators shoot 53.3 percent in the final 20 minutes. Florida went 36.4 percent shoot-ing in the first half. 
“In the first half, I thought we made a 
lot of poor decisions,” Donovan said.

“I just told those guys at halftime that 
Casey’s not coming back in,” coach Billy Donovan said. “We’re basically down to six guys right now.”
With the midgame blow to their front-
court, the Gators needed someone to step up.
Will Yeguete answered the call.Florida turned around a slow offensive 
start to record its third road win and first away from home in SEC play thanks to Yeguete’s game-high 13 rebounds.
“I thought we won the game based on 
our defense,” Donovan said.
“I thought our defense, our ability to 
defend the three-point line and then our ability to rebound the ball were keys in the game for us.”
Despite shooting 0 of 2 in the first half, 
Yeguete led the team defensively by grab-bing six boards. He stepped up his perfor -
mance during the second half in Prathers’ absence.
The junior finished the game with 10 
points on 4-for-6 shooting in his 25 min-utes on the floor, all while nursing tendini-tis in his right knee. 
Still, Yeguete’s 13 boards helped Florida 
outrebound LSU 53-34. 
“It’s so hard to find players that are re-
ally interested in doing all the dirty work, things that don’t necessarily show up in a stat sheet, and you don’t get a lot of atten-tion for them,” Donovan said.
 “He’s a great defender. He’s a really 
good pick-and-roll defender. He’s really, really good at rebounding the basketball. He’s a great high-deflection guy. I tell him all the time how much … I appreciate a guy like him, because the last thing I want him to feel is unappreciated.” 
Boynton also came through big for the 
Gators in the second half. After going 2 for 6 in the first half, Boynton finished the game with 20 points, seven rebounds and two assists. 
Although Donovan credited Florida’s 
defense with the win, Boynton still felt the Gators struggled in handling press de-fense. 
“We know as a team that we got to get 
better at that,” Boynton said. “That’s a con-cern definitely regardless of if we got the win or not. I think we’ve got to do a better job of spacing the floor.”

ence. This is just adding fuel to our fire because we’ve come up short twice against teams that we should have had different outcomes.”
UF entered Sunday with 
a 3-44 mark all-time against Tennessee (1-9 with Butler as coach), but was in position for win No. 4 against UT.
Despite losing senior Jenni-
fer George, who suffered a dis-located shoulder for the second time in three games, Florida traded punches with Tennessee (13-3, 4-0 SEC).
With 3:56 remaining in the 
first half, George’s shoulder popped out and popped back in on its own. She did not re-turn.
Trailing 64-59 with 7:09 re-
maining in the second half, Florida responded with a 7-0 run to take its first lead since 14:09 remained in the first half. 
Jaterra Bonds capped the run with a layup and finished with a team-best 18 points in the game. She has led UF in scoring in all four conference games, averaging 18.8 points per game during the stretch. 
Bonds had an opportunity 
to win the game in regulation but was unable to attempt a shot after losing her balance. 
“We were supposed to have 
a quick screen, but we had a mix up or a misunderstanding,” Bonds said. “It is what it is. You end up going to overtime, and that’s what you get.”
Butler, who has lost to Ten-
nessee both as a coach and a player, missed on what could have been a program-defining victory . 
Instead, it is simply another 
setback as Florida looks to con-tinue moving forward toward greater legitimacy . 
“We’re growing; we’re on 
a journey ,” Butler said. “It’s a process, and this is a step in it. It’s a painful process and a painful step in our process.”

Florida’s gymnastics team  
waited patiently for the final 
team scores Friday evening in Baton Rouge, La.
The final results went down to 
the wire. 
No. 8 LSU topped No. 3 Flori-
da 196.875-196.575 in the Gators’ first dual meet against a ranked opponent.
Meets between the Top-10 
Southeastern Conference teams are traditionally close.
Since 1995, less than half a 
point has decided 21 of the 36 UF-LSU meetings.
Friday night’s meet was no 
different.
Heading into the balance 
beam exercise, Florida held a .25 advantage over its SEC rival. 
However, uncharacteristic 
missteps by Olympian Bridget Sloan and All-American Marissa King resulted in Florida using a fall score for its final beam total of 48.775. 
LSU’s 49.325 floor exercise 
sealed a win by a margin of 0.3 points.  
“Tonight will be a very posi-
tive learning experience,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. 
“Coming here, we knew 
that LSU is a talented team and against any team in the SEC, es-pecially on the road, you really have to hit if you expect to walk away with a win. For us to finish up with two falls on beam — that isn’t going to get it done. Some things were absolutely amazing and some things were a little bit rough.”
Faehn is certain the loss will 
only strengthen an already deep and experienced team. 
“[The loss is] something that 
is going to be a positive where everyone on the team can look individually where they have to work harder and where they have to improve,” Faehn said. 
But on an evening full of blem-
ishes, Kytra Hunter was locked in. 
The sophomore standout 
pieced together an impressive early-season debut performance, recording scores of 9.9-plus in each of the four all-around events. 
Hunter, who finished ahead 
of the field in vault and bars with scores of 9.950 and 9.900, respec-tively, earned the evening’s all-around event title with a score of 39.675.
 She matched her college best 
on uneven bars to share the crown with LSU’s Sarie Morrison. 
Hunter just missed out on the 
floor title with a score of 9.925. LSU’s Lloiminica Hall  won with a 9.95 score.
Gators gymnast Mackenzie 
Caquatto won the beam title with a score of 9.95. Hunter was sec-ond with 9.9.
Hunter’s sturdiness was on 
display from the get-go.
“She was competing with tre-
mendous discipline and focus. Her vault, I could’ve given it a 10 — it was beautiful,” Faehn said. 
Aside from the individual ac-
colades, Hunter stressed the im-portance of refocusing. 
“This has put a bad taste in 
our mouths and this is not the way we wanted to start our (SEC) season,” Hunter said.
“But it is a stepping stone and 
it needs to be a step that we learn from as we look toward the end of the season.
“We’d rather it happen now 
than later.”

On Saturday at the Crim-
son Tide Indoor Opener in 
Birmingham, Ala., freshmen Najee Glass and Arman Hall had to replace two members of the 2012 NCAA Championship 4x400-meter relay team who clinched Florida’s first outdoor national title.
Glass and Hall came through 
with a win.
The two paired up with 
sophomores Hugh Graham Jr. and Dedric Dukes to grab the win with a time of 3:07.59, which is the second-fastest time in the NCAA for the 2013 sea-son.
“Anybody who knows us 
and knows our program ex-pects us to perform at a high level,” coach Mike Holloway said. “When we’re recruiting athletes, we don’t recruit them to be successful when they’re juniors and seniors. We expect them to come in and contribute right away, and that’s what you saw with our freshman class [Saturday].”
In addition to helping Flor -
ida win the men’s 4x400, Hall and Glass finished the men’s 200 meters in second and fourth, respectively. 
Overall, the Gators had 17 
top-three finishes on Saturday, including six event victories. 
On the women’s side, fresh-
man Kyra Jefferson had the strongest outing of all newcom-ers. 
After finishing second in her 
section of the 60 meters with a time of 7.47, Jefferson went on to run the third leg of the women’s 4x400-meter relay. Jefferson teamed up with La-nie Whittaker, Destinee Gause and Ebony Eutsey to help the Gators take a second place fin-ish with a time of 3:38.65, fall-ing to Texas by only .43. 
“I’m very proud of all of 
[the freshmen], and I think as a whole, the team performed at a high level,” Holloway said. “I wanted to see some pride, I wanted to see some passion and I wanted to see execution. We had all of those [Saturday].”
While the freshmen may 
have stolen the spotlight dur -
ing Florida’s season opener, sophomores Ciarra Brewer and Marquis Dendy dominated the competition in long jump. Brewer and Dendy swept the long jump titles for Florida with marks of 6.09m and 7.75m, re-spectively.
Cory McGee and Eddie 
Lovett shined for the juniors as they won each of their events.
While McGee is no stranger 
to competing in the 800 meters during the outdoor season, Saturday was her first time running the event indoors at Florida. McGee used a time of 2:09.01 to recover from a stum-ble and win the race. 
Lovett, the two-time South-
eastern Conference champion in 60-meter hurdles, carried over the success of his 2012 campaign by getting a win on Saturday. His time of 7.80 in the finals beat the rest of the field by a sizeable margin.
“For [Lovett] to run by him-
self and beat the field by that much, that was impressive and it’s easily the fastest he’s ever opened up (a season),” Hollo-way said. “Across the board, I was just very pleased with the effort and the focus of our ath-letes today.”

  Florida’s 78-75 overtime loss to No. 9 Ten-
nessee was a wasted opportunity.
The Gators missed out on their big-
gest win since, well, the last time they beat 
the Volunteers — in 2009.
On a campus where the women’s basket-
ball program struggles to gain relevance and attention, a win against Tennessee would have meant the world.
  Overcoming a nine-point deﬁ  cit in the sec-
ond half was not enough. Neither was push-
ing a Top-10 juggernaut into overtime.  
    Despite playing arguably its best game of 
the season, UF still lost.
Folks enjoyed playing “what if” for a cou-
ple of hours. Once the ﬁ  nal buzzer sounded, they stopped caring. It was fun while it lasted.
Sunday’s crowd of 2,609 was an anomaly.Florida’s 10 home games this season have 
averaged 1,055 spectators, which ranks next to last in the Southeastern Conference.
By ﬁ  ve fans.The spotlight came and went.The Gators never had a chance to win. The 
Volunteers are just too good.
  Should facing just another SEC opponent 
be so daunting? No.
  Should Florida celebrate a moral victory af-
ter losing a close game to Tennessee? Hell, no.
  But in their current state, the Gators are 
stuck playing catch-up. It’s hard to lead the pack with lackluster support.
  In 2011, Florida’s expenses for women’s 
basketball numbered $3,018,356, which ranked 29th nationally . Tennessee led the nation with expenses totaling $5,892,060.
  Logically speaking, the gap between the 
Gators and the Volunteers is not alarming. Af-ter all, the UT women’s basketball program is a winning machine built by Pat Summitt, the greatest college basketball coach ever (Yeah, I said it. What are you going to do about it?).
  Meanwhile, women’s basketball is the only 
sport at UF that has not won a conference championship.
  However, the main cause for concern is 
that Florida ranked ninth in women’s basket-ball expenses among SEC teams in 2011. Ten-nessee, Vanderbilt, Texas A&M, Auburn, Ar-kansas, LSU, Georgia and Kentucky all spend more than UF.
  This is not a cry for the University Athletic 
Association to pour more money into wom-en’s basketball, but what Florida puts into the team speaks volumes. How much does the ad-ministration care about the sport?
  When the Gators earned a bid in the 2011 
Women’s National Invitation Tournament, they played Florida Gulf Coast in Fort Myers. In a tournament where homecourt advantage is earned through a bidding process, how in the world did FGCU outspend UF?
  Seems ludicrous, right?  Apathy is the most reasonable conclusion.  Given Florida’s resources and its all-around 
success in sports, the futility of the women’s basketball program should be embarrassing.  However, despite whatever the administra-tion’s attitude toward the women’s basket-ball program may be, UF should still be better.
  Butler is the fast-
est coach to win 100 games in program history , but does 
reaching the NCAA Tournament twice in ﬁ  ve seasons really warrant a contract extension?
  Butler’s predecessor, Carolyn Peck, was 
ﬁ  red after leading the Gators to The Big Dance twice in ﬁ  ve seasons. Why was Butler reward-ed for producing nearly the same resume?
  Anything other than March Madness 
should be considered a failure at UF. And no, the WNIT does not count as March Madness, so don’t use that to champion Butler’s cause.
  Other small sports are winning SEC and 
national championships, and Butler received an extension for sneaking into last season’s NCAA Tournament despite winning just four games against teams in the RPI Top 50.
  Florida’s loss to Tennessee was painful, 
and there are multiple parties at fault.
  But as long as UF treats women’s basket-
ball as an afterthought and accepts middling results, the Gators will just have to be satisﬁ  ed with coming close.
