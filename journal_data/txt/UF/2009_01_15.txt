Economic and environmental sustainability 
were themes of the 5th annual State of the City 
address given by Mayor Peegen Hanrahan Tuesday morning.
She announced several new additions 
to the Gainesville Police Department and Gainesville Fire Rescue, praised the city’s en-vironmental friendliness and spoke against an upcoming amendment.
An Intelligence Center will be built behind 
the GPD’s Operations Center, which is being renovated, Hanrahan said. The Intelligence Center will house crime analysts from GPD and the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office, which will help the agencies share information 
and expertise. 
Hanrahan also ad-
dressed GPD’s em-barrassment over a November scandal in 
which police officers were arrested for solicit-ing prostitutes while on duty . 
“Our management team is taking strong and unambiguous actions to reinforce core values, code of conduct, professionalism, eth-ics and integrity,” Hanrahan said.
All members of GPD were asked to attend 
a training in organizational ethics and integ-rity.

Cynthia Russell, 50, of Newberry , recently won 
a ticket to President-elect Barack 
Obama’s inauguration through 
an essay contest sponsored by the Presidential Inaugural Committee. Russell, who has lived in the area since 1978, worked with Obama’s 
grassroots campaign. She owns 
three businesses, Emerald Ventures, a construction company , Studio 
One Home Staging, an interior design company, and 
Magnolia Manor, a property management company . 
MC: What qualities in Barack Obama attracted you to 
his campaign?
CR: He seems highly intelligent — very intelligent 
— very focused and very calm. It never seemed like 
he got really negative in the campaign. You know, he seems like he respects people and their ideas, but the biggest thing was his message of change. I’ve voted Republican in the past, and I don’t vote for a particular party. I vote for whoever I feel will do the best job. Essay winner

A Wednesday vote by UF’s Board of 
Trustees increased the likelihood that UF nurs-
ing students will have new places to train.
The board voted unanimously to help com-
plete the corporate restructuring of Shands 
Healthcare to make it easier for medical fa-
cilities to become partners with the not-for-profit company and opening up new training grounds for students.
The bulk of the restructuring was approved 
by Shands’ board of directors late last year, but UF’s trustees amended the corporate rules of 
Shands at UF to make them compatible with 
the new configuration, which established a parent company to oversee all of the hospital’s 
subsidiary units, like Shands Jacksonville.
Tim Goldfarb, 
Shands Healthcare 
CEO, said after the meeting that all major uni-versities with hospitals have already done so.Goldfarb said the new setup will let future 
partners have more autonomy, but will not change basic operations.
“It’s paperwork, it’s legal documentation, 
it makes no difference in how we do day-to-
day business,” he said.

STUDENT LIFE
By JACQUELYN WEINER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Although UF has no official 
plans to for President-elect Barack 
Obama’s inauguration Tuesday, 
student groups will be holding 
viewings and other events on cam -
pus. 
Obama will take office as the 
44th president of the United States 
on Jan. 20 at noon. 
“It’s just not an event we 
planned for,”  UF spokseman 
Aaron Hoover said.
Hoover said he could not cite 
a specific reason for the lack of a 
university-sponsored celebration.There are, however, other on-
campus options for celebrating the 
historic event.
A screening of the inaugura -
tion,  complete with free food, will 
be held at the Orange & Brew. from 
11 a.m. to 2 p.m., according to the 
Reitz Union Web site.
If there is overflow, the inaugu -
ration may also be shown in room 
282 of the Reitz Union, Hoover 
said. 
The Reitz Union is funded by 
Student Government,  according 
to its Web site.
Eric Conrad, former co-chapter 
coordinator for UF Students for 
Barack Obama, said the celebra -tion at the Orange & Brew will be 
the place to be for student demo -
crats come Tuesday.
“Some groups were trying to 
plan stuff on their own, but as soon 
as we knew the Reitz Union Board 
was planning something, we jumped on board,” Conrad said.
Conrad said UF’s decision not 
to host additional screenings of 
the noon-time inauguration is un -
derstandable and is “really more a 
symptom of the timing.”
In addition to the party at the 
Orange & Brew, Jan. 20, 2009 was 
deemed “Barack Obama Day” in a 
Student Senate resolution passed 
at the first meeting of the spring 
semester.
Still, the inaugural efforts by 
students and the university pale 
in comparison to the enthusiasm 
that surrounded the presidential 
election.
This change in UF students’ political interest was inevitable be -
cause there are no more unknowns, 
said Jacob Brandt, a UF anthropol -
ogy junior.
 “After the election, it’s like 
a waiting period,” Brandt said. 
“Inauguration is just telling people 
what they already know.”
Katie Perez, an advertising ju -
nior, agreed that there hasn’t been 
much buzz about the event around 
campus, but said she was sur -
prised UF isn’t planning anything 
for the event.
“I actually kind of find that 
strange,” she said. “I would think 
that there would be a lot more in -
volvement and awareness.”No official campus events planned for inaugurationJohn Lockett / Alligator

Local agencies are prepar -
ing extra shelter for homeless 
people looking to get away 
from the cold as tempera -
tures dip below freezing this 
week.
“Anytime the tempera -
ture is 45 degrees or below, 
we open up additional emer -
gency shelter, which allows 
us to increase our numbers 
above the normal 35,” said 
Kent Vann, executive direc -
tor at St. Francis House.
St. Francis House opened 
its doors to more than 90 
people this fall, and the shel -
ter expects more of a turnout 
if temperatures drop to pre -
dicted record lows. 
The agency provided 
shelter for 92 people Tuesday 
night. 
“The number of home -
less people in Gainesville has gone up 43 percent in 
the past year alone,” said Jon 
DeCarmine, executive direc -
tor of the City of Gainesville/
Alachua County Office on 
Homelessness. 
The temperature early 
Thursday morning is pre -
dicted to be 28 degrees, 
dropping to 26 degrees early 
Friday and 20 degrees by 
Saturday, said Marie Trabert, 
a meteorologist 
at the National 
Weather Service 
Forecast Office in 
Jacksonville.
Other local agencies like 
HOMEvan, a mobile outreach 
unit of the St. Vincent de Paul 
Society, is also helping.
HOMEvan handed out 
100 blankets Tuesday night 
and served about 400 meals 
last week, said HOMEvan co -
ordinator Arupa Freeman.
“There’s so many more 
homeless people this winter 
than last,” she said. “Even 
if you have 12 blankets, can 
you imagine living outside in 
that?”Agencies provide homeless with shelter from cold
“I actually kind of find 
that strange. I would think 
that there would be a lot 
more involvement and                
awareness.”

Alachua County Sheriff’s Office 
deputies arrived at Majestic Oaks 
Apartments at 6:30 p.m. Tuesday 
after receiving a call that a man 
had been stabbed.
According to the ASO arrest 
report, they saw a man lying on 
the ground in the parking lot with multiple stab wounds to his neck, 
chest and back.
He was taken to Shands at UF 
for treatment where 
the medical staff said 
he had a punctured 
lung and was put on 
a ventilator, the re -
port stated.
Sherry Curtis, 23, contacted 
the Combined Communications 
Center and turned herself in five 
hours after the search for her be -
gan.
When arrested, she told police 
that her boyfriend did not agree with her going out to celebrate her 
birthday, but that she had gone 
anyway. 
Curtis told police she was run -

heard her boyfriend scream, “I’m 
going to kill you.”
She turned around, she said, 
and he punched her in the face.
Curtis said she then grabbed a

Award-winning actress Carol Burnett performed at the 
Phillips Center for the Performing Arts Wednesday as part 
of her national tour “Laughter and Reflection with Carol 
Burnett.”
For two and a half hours, Burnett answered questions from 
the audience and played clips from “The Carol Burnett Show,” 
her variety show on CBS that started in 1967.
“The most amazing thing in my career was having the show 
on for 11 years,” Burnett said.
The show, which featured actors and per -
formers including Ray Charles, Steve Martin 
and Lucille Ball, was a smorgasbord of com -
edy sketches and musical performances.
Although the five-time Emmy Award-
winning actress acquired fame from stage 
performances, television and movies, in -
cluding her role as Miss Hannigan in Annie,  
Burnett said she didn’t originally plan to be 
an actress.
“I wanted to be a journalist,” she told the audience of 5,000. 
“I was the editor of my high school paper.”
As a child, Burnett’s grandmother took her to see a movie 
starring James Stewart, who first inspired her.
Burnett met Stewart, who she referred to as “my love since I 
was 3 years old,” at the dawn of her acting career.
She confessed to publicly embarrassing herself when she 
met him on his lunch break on his movie set.
“I didn’t know what to say , so I said, ‘Well, I guess it’s time 
to tie on the old feedbag,” she said. “And then, I stepped off the 
platform into a bucket of whitewash.”
Burnett took questions from fans throughout the night.
One man in the audience asked, “Carol...your legs. They are 
far from unattractive. What do you do to keep them so thin?” 
Burnett replied, “I just don’t let the hair grow too much.”Burnett visits UF

 MAN ON RTS BUS CHARGED WITH LEWD 
OR LASCIVIOUS EXHIBITION.
A man was arrested Tuesday after two teenagers 
reported to authorities that he was masturbating on a 
city bus.
At about 8:25 a.m., a man walked onto RTS bus No. 
6 and sat down between two girls, ages 15 and 17, who 
were on their way to school. 
According to the Gainesville Police Department ar -
rest report, the man asked one of the girls if she could 
give him lotion. 
After the girl put the lotion in his hand, the man put 
his hands down his pants and began to touch himself 
while the two underage girls were sitting on either side 
of him.
The girls reported that he took his genitals out of his 
sweatpants and continued to touch himself.“When the girls got off, they reported the incident 
to the school resource manager who contacted GPD,” 
said GPD spokeswoman Summer Hallett. “We tracked 
down the bus, and the man was still on it.”
Robert Hill, 50, was arrested and charged with lewd 
or lascivious exhibition.
Hill admitted to asking the girl for lotion, but he said 
he did not touch himself inappropriately, Hallett said.

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

Although Student Government elections are more 
than a month away, the rush to register student par -
ties began Monday.
Seven parties: Change, Gator, Orange and Blue, 
Progress, Reform, Swamp and Unite have put their 
names down so far, according to Supervisor of 
Elections Dan Siegel. 
Five turned in paperwork about 15 minutes after 
the registration began at 9 a.m., he said.  
“That’s how it is every year,” Siegel said.
He added that some party presidents camped out 
starting at 8 a.m. to nab their name of choice. 
Two people applied to use Unite and Swamp as 
party names, he said. 
As of 5 p.m. Wednesday, Siegel said the Swamp 
Party name dispute has not been settled.  
Student senators recently approved legislation 
that gives first dibs to the party president who has 
used the name in question at least once in the past 
three semesters.  
He said the number of parties registered is un -
usual.
“All of the party presidents are people who are 
pretty active on campus and I think are maybe kind 
of tired of the student party system,” Siegel said, 
adding they may be disappointed with the results 
past parties have achieved.Parties vie for

Sen. Mark McShera will run for Student Body president 
after the Orange and Blue Party nominated him Saturday.
McShera, who represents students in UF’s College of 
Liberal Arts and Sciences, said running on the executive 
ticket is an exciting opportunity and hopes to broaden the 
work of SG to reach the majority of students. 
“Student Government’s history certainly is exclusive 
rather than inclusive, and I think Orange and Blue really at 
its core will make Student Government respectable to the 
average student,” he said.  McShera, a UF history junior, said he began his involve -
ment with SG in fall of 2007. 
As a senator, he helped increase representation for CLAS 
in the Student Senate and aided in crafting an Amendment 
2 resolution and negotiations between parties, he said. 
McShera said he expects online voting and responsible 
spending to be a big part of the Orange and Blue Party plat -
form, which will be released in the coming weeks. 
If he wins, one issue McShera said he intends to push for 
is switching UF’s Webmail system to Gmail. 
McShera says he expects to win and has distanced him -
self from past UF Student Body presidents.

dent,” he said.Orange & Blue nominate McShera

Student Senate President Jordan 
Johnson announced Wednesday that he 
will be running for Student Government 
president this spring.
Although Johnson, who represents 
District B, has represented the Gator 
Party in the past, this election he has cho -
sen to run on a new party’s ticket: the 
Unite Party.
“The Unite Party was created to bring 
people together,” he said. “It offers stu -dents something different.” 
Johnson, a UF economics senior, has 
been involved with SG for two years. 
He served as the chairman of the Senate 
Budget and Appropriations Committee, 
overseeing SG’s $13.7 million budget, be -
fore becoming Senate president. 
Johnson said he decided to run be -
cause he believes it is time for a positive 
change.
“There has been a major division in 
Student Government between parties 
and politics,” he said. “It’s time to unite 
and to work toward bipartisanship.” Johnson said students care about ef -
fectiveness and results, not petty bicker -
ing between student political parties.
“In order to implement change, it 
must start from the top,” he said.
He has yet to choose a vice president 
and treasurer as his running mates.
He plans to start interviews next 
week.  
Johnson believes that he has a good 
chance of winning the upcoming elec -
tion.
“Absolutely,” he said. “But I don’t ex -
pect to win without working hard.”Senate President to run with Unite Party The views expressed here are not necessarily those of the  Alligator .

City’s fairweather 
policies need overhaul
ColumnAs plummeting temperatures hit Gainesville this week, 
securing a bed in area homeless shelters has become 
a hotter commodity than the SG presidency.
The unforgiving chill of Tuesday evening saw more than 
90 homeless people descend upon the St. Francis House for a 
place to stay as the mercury dropped below 45 degrees.
So much for coming to Gainesville for the weather.
The Editorial Board has the utmost respect for the area 
shelters working around the clock to meet the needs of 
Gainesville’s homeless population, but we must concede not 
enough is being done to help them.
We aren’t talking about UF students refusing to part with 
their spare change or crossing the street to avoid confronta -
tion with a homeless person. Rather, we take issue with the 
city for failing to deliver on its promises of a one-stop home -
less shelter for Gainesville – a place with plenty of room that 
can open its doors regardless of the weather.
Just because the temperature may be over 45 degrees 
doesn’t exactly bode for pleasant conditions on the street.
We urge the city of Gainesville to stop treating the home -
less as second-class citizens and move forward with their 
plans to build a shelter. Give this ever-growing demographic 
of our population a chance to reclaim their lives and break 
free from the cyclical nature of their existence.
It’s so easy to turn a blind eye — but is it really so much 
harder to make a difference?
Better known as “the bailout,” Congress passed the 
$700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program last 
October. This program was widely criticized for 
its sheer volume as it nearly doubled the federal deficit 
for 2008.
People also wondered what else could be done with 
$700 billion – a figure higher than the gross domestic 
product of Turkey.
What did we learn from this outrageous government 
spending? Is it that we need to put an end to this excess? 
Or maybe we should just put a stop to the regulation 
and government interference that caused the economic 
disaster in the first place?
Nope. We learned absolutely nothing from the bail -
out. In fact, President-elect Barack Obama is about to go 
at it again.
Even though he’s not the president yet, he’s already 
working with lawmakers to create an  “economic stim -
ulus package” of $800 billion. Yes, you read that right 
— $100 billion more than last year’s federal bailout. 
Insiders have estimated that this could push this year’s 
deficit spending up to about $2 trillion — more than 
double what it was in 2007.  
The package includes about $300 billion in tax cuts 
for the middle class and businesses, in addition to about 
$500 billion in new spending on infrastructure, develop -
ment and renewable energy. The question is, would this 
stimulate the economy? And does such a responsibility 
fall on the government’s shoulders?
Unfortunately, government spending and handouts 
have proven largely ineffective at stimulating the econ -
omy. The $165 billion “stimulus package” last summer 
that sent $600 checks to families did nothing to stop a looming recession. And “govern -
ment spending” is usually just a 
nice way of saying inefficient allo -
cation of resources.  
Unless the spending is an equal or better allocation 
of the money than it would be if the money were spent 
by the people who earned it, the government spending 
is actually hurting us. And I don’t trust the same people 
who run the DMV to properly allocate $800 billion.
Nothing about Obama’s package or the one before it 
makes any attempt to address the causes of our recession 
in the first place. Government regulations which man -
dated low-income loans caused the housing bubble, and 
the federally controlled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
undercut private competition to lead our financial sec -
tor into ruin. The federal bailouts set an ominous prec -
edent in which bad management is federally protected.  
And so Obama’s solution is more government spend -
ing.
This would be like stuffing your face with five 
cheeseburgers. After that much meat and cheese, you’re 
probably going to feel sick and tired.
Most of us at this point would probably stop eat -
ing, but the federal government would do otherwise. It 
would say that it is tired because it needs more energy, 
and so to get that energy would eat another five cheese -
burgers. Hopefully after 10 servings, the government 
will finally realize its mistake.
I was under the impression that Obama would bring 
about change. Hopefully next week he’ll change my 
mind, but as of now I’m thoroughly disappointed.

Letters to the Editor
Column ignores Americans 
killed by terrorists
My letter is in response to 
Naudia Jawad’s blatantly terror-
sympathetic column entitled 
“Is there life for detainees af -
ter Gitmo?” in Wednesday’s 
Alligator.
Therein, she states that any 
glimpse we get into the world 
of the prison at Guantanamo 
Bay shows harmless, “subdued” 
men who just mope around or sit 
against fences. 
Jawad goes on to say, “They 
certainly don’t seem like mur -
derous masterminds...” While I 
must admit I’m impressed with 
her clairvoyance and insight into 
the minds of men at an institution 
so far away from her, I have huge 
problems with her facts and her 
position. 
Photographs and forensic 
evidence like fingerprints and 
DNA have linked 61 previously 
released detainees from Gitmo 
to recent terror activity, accord -
ing to Pentagon spokesman Geoff 
Morrell. This number is up from 
37 as of March of 2008. 
So much for their alleged in -
nocence. 
Next, Jawad belittles a terror 
suspect trained in the art of mak -
ing detonators out of Sega video 
game cartridges, saying, “If his 
little terrorist buddies are as bad 
as he is, Guantanamo must be a 
horrid place indeed.”
Yes, it is a horrid place. Perhaps 
she’s never had a friend who was 
killed by a remote-detonated 
device. I have, and I take great 
offense to your unprofessional 
and irresponsible prattle about a 
subject in which you are not well 
versed. 
Finally, this “local gang,” 
as she calls them, would never 
have been “rounded up” if 2,974 
American civilians had not been 
executed by their “alleged” affili -
ates in 2001.

After all, what is the law for? 
It is already illegal to give alcohol

If the city can no longer afford

Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan delivers the 2009 State of the City address at the 
Hippodrome State Theatre on Wednesday.
completion date for the fire station is 
May 2010. Both the building and the truck will be built to green standards.
Hanrahan discussed environmental-
ism, pointing to Gainesville’s acceptance 
of Wild Spaces, Public Places as a sign of 
Gainesville’s commitment to combat cli-mate change.
Gainesville Regional Utilities has also 
helped make Gainesville more environ-mentally sound, she said.
GRU’s proposed solar feed-in tariff, 
which would pay citizens for their excess solar power, met praise from environ-
mental organizations around the world.“I’m very pleased with the environ-
mental issues she brought up,” said Kali 
Blount, a community advocate who at-tended the address. “That’s getting us out of the Stone Age.”
After pointing out Gainesville’s dedi-
cation to diversity, Hanrahan spoke out against an amendment that will be put before the citizens on May 24. The pro-posed amendment would remove anti-discriminatory protections for public workers. 
“[It] would mark Gainesville, wrong-
ly, as a place willing to tolerate intoler -
ance,” Hanrahan said.

MC: How does Barack Obama inspire you?
I said in the essay he gave me hope that 
the coming years would be better. The eco-
nomic situation especially affects all of us. 
The housing industry has been hurting for a while in Gainesville. We’ve been feeling it for a couple of years, but it’s just now get-
ting where people are noticing it in the banks 
and Wall Street and retail. I think all of that stems from the housing market. When I build a house, I put hundreds of people to work. That trickles down to hundreds of suppliers 
and hundreds of manufacturers that make 
our products. That’s one of the problems with the economy. I’ve built one house in one-and-a-half years. That’s what gives me 
hope: Finally , someone’s going to get in there 
and take care of the changes that need to be done. He may not be able to do it this year or next because of the economy, but I think that it will eventually get taken care of. The guy’s 
got a lot on his shoulders. I don’t know why 
anyone would want to be president, but I’m glad he does.    
MC: What was your initial reaction when 
you found out you won a ticket to the inaugu-
ration?
CR: Right when they called, I thought, 
“Hmmm. What’s going on?” The guy on the 
phone said, “We’re trying to narrow them (the 
essay entries) down,” and I said, “OK. Maybe 
I’m in the running.” I thought my boyfriend had put someone up to trick me. I said to the guy, “I hope I’m not being Punk’d.” I’m still surprised in my essay because it’s very short. 
I didn’t even realize it was an essay. It was 
just a thought that I had about my situation, and I guess it’s what they were looking for because it really did come from the heart. 
MC: If you had to name one fault in 
Obama, what would it be?
CR: He wants there to be a playoff (laughs). I think we know the winner and who’s No. 1 - it’s the Gators.
As far as some of his other things, I’m not 
really involved in Washington politics at all. 
I never went into this automatically thinking 
that I was going to support Barack Obama. I 
did try to get onto his Web site so I could be a little knowledge-able, but it’s really impossible 
for someone like me, in Florida, 
working every day , to know everything that’s 
going on in Washington. I was always getting these e-mails saying that Obama is bad, and 
that he voted for this or against that. And then 
I look at the actual bills, and they have all of these attachments and add-ons that most people don’t even realize exist. I just have to vote for the person who I feel the most com-
fortable with, who agrees with me. With John 
McCain, I thought he was a wonderful man and a great public servant. I believe he would have tried to do the best job possible, but for 
some reason, I didn’t see him as our leader, 
the president, but as a politician trying to get the next job up the ladder, you know? And the issue of him being black wasn’t an issue for me. I’m glad we have our first black presi-
dent. I’ll be glad when we elect a woman, 
but really I just want the best leader whether they’re white, black, male or female.
The Winning Essay
“I’m a single woman who has been 
building homes for over 18 years. I’ve sup-
ported myself and have been able to help out my mother from time to time. Now I 
find myself wondering how much longer I 
can hold on and be able to pay my bills and keep the doors open for business. Barack gives me hope. Hope that 2009 will truly bring change to Americans who find them-selves in this mess with me.”

sex on the avenuePresidential tradition
boardrooms to bedrooms 
Well, ladies and gentlemen, 
the time has finally come. In less 
than a week, Bush is out of office. 
Critics might allege that he de -
stroyed our economy, started two 
wars and even failed to correctly 
pronounce the word nuclear on 
a regular basis. But he succeeded 
in one area—he is leaving the 
White House without a sex scan -
dal on his record.
As detrimental to our govern -
ment as the Clinton-Lewinsky 
scandal was, we all secretly 
know it was nice to hear that 
the president was just a regular 
guy in need of some “sexual re -
lations.”
So, with a new president tak -
ing office, are we in for any juicy 
sexual controversies? It’s been 
a while since any groundbreak -
ing government gossip has been 
spilled.
Sure, Sarah 
Palin’s teenage 
daughter got 
knocked up, but 
that was hardly 
entertaining. 
Of course 
there was Eliot 
Spitzer, the gov -
ernor of New York, who could 
have pulled the country out of 
our economic deficit with all the 
money he spent on prostitutes, 
but still, not outrageous enough. 
Barack Obama has often been 
called the John F. Kennedy of our 
time. He’s young, good-looking, 
has a beautiful family and speaks 
for new America. But JFK’s re -
cord wasn’t quite as clean (sexu -
ally) as Bush’s. 
I’m sure you’ve all heard 
it: The sultry voice of sex icon 
Marilyn Monroe singing “Happy 
Birthday Mr. President.” Well, 
let’s just say she gave him more 
than a song for his birthday. 
Kennedy isn’t the only U.S. 
president who sought out a mis -
tress, though. Wilson, Roosevelt 
and Eisenhower all carried on il -
licit relationships. 
There were even rumors that 
Jefferson fathered the child of 
one of his African-American 
slaves. 
And just to clarify, though 
Deep Throat sounds like a strip -
per name, Watergate had noth -
ing to do with sex.
So, if the Obamas are the 
supposed reincarnation of the 
Kennedys, it seems as though we 
might have a sex scandal on our 
hands in the next four years. 
I recently saw the cover of a 
tabloid advertising that Oprah and Obama were getting too 
close. I know she was a big sup -
porter during the campaign, but 
come on, seriously? He can do 
way better.
If he were going to go after 
someone, it would definitely not 
be Oprah. Obama may be the 
Kennedy of our time, but there 
is no modern-day comparison to 
Marilyn Monroe. Her legacy will 
reign forever. So, who would it 
be? 
Let’s think diva. Beyoncé 
could be a good match. Her cara -
mel skin and hip-shaking abili -
ties could definitely earn her 
some playtime in the oval office. 
Her talent is a plus, too. You 
know you’d be turned on if 
Beyoncé sang “Happy Birthday” 
to you. But then again, even the 
secret service might not be able 
to stop a scorned Jay-Z. Perhaps 
bootylicious isn’t 
the best choice.
Maybe some -
one more excit -
ing would be 
better, like the 
newly single 
Britney Spears. 
According to 
MTV’s “For the Record,” she’s 
not as crazy as we all thought, 
and I’m sure K-Fed wouldn’t 
mind either. Obama is just the 
womanizer she’s been looking 
for. 
But he could just skip the di -
vas and go straight to an actress. 
Halle Berry anyone? 
She was the first African 
American woman to win best 
actress, and he’s the first African 
American president; they’d be 
the perfect history making cou -
ple! 
Maybe she’d rip out her cat -
woman costume and play dress 
up for Mr. President. 
Or maybe he’d be even more 
scandalous and go for a younger 
lady like Rihanna, who could 
easily seduce Obama on a rainy 
day in Washington D.C. 
I’m sure she’d have no prob -
lem inviting Obama to stand un -
der her umbrella. 
Let’s just hope, for the coun -
try’s sake, that if there is a first 
mistress in the making, it doesn’t 
create a national uproar.
America is already dealing 
with a war and a crumbling 
economy. We don’t need an im -
peachment on our hands, too. 
After all, we all know—and 
I think even Joe Six-Pack would 
agree—that every now and then 
a guy just needs some action.ASHLEY ROSS   AVENUE WRITER
So, with a new 
president taking 
office, are
we in for any juicy sexual 
controversies? ““12, ALLIGATOR   THURSDAY, JANUARY 15, 2009
I’m on a mission to be more ap -
proachable. The rare, 20-second con -
versations at parties are really get -
ting disheartening, especially when 
they end with, “You’re blocking the 
keg.”  
So to break the ice, I dove in 
headfirst: live adult entertainment. 
Clothing is always awkward for me, 
so perhaps by talk -
ing to people not 
wearing any , I’ll 
gain some perspec -
tive.
Also, naked 
women!
The venue’s in -
terior had a more practical design 
than I predicted. I was expecting a 
big spectacle with strobe lights and 
a bubble machine, but instead I saw 
simpler transaction: sexy women 
dance while men stare at them.  
I suppose that makes sense. 
Maybe I should’ve pulled the leash 
on my sexual fantasies when they 
started involving Broadway musical 
numbers. 
I found myself focusing more on 
my hot wings than the dancers. At 
one point, I looked over and saw 
that one of them had slipped into 
a seat next to me, which had been 
mysteriously vacated. She noticed 
the chicken graveyard. 
“Do you like to eat meat?” she 
asked provocatively, staring me di -
rectly in the eyes. Subtlety, it seems, 
doesn’t make money.
“Yes,” I responded. Sexy , I know. Eventually she revealed her in -
tentions — a lap dance, paid for by 
my friends — and she led me to a 
curtained booth in the back. 
While waiting for her to prepare, 
I read signs on the walls of the booth 
warning against having an orgasm. 
I found this interesting for two rea -
sons: One, I found something in 
common between 
a strip club and a 
church; and two, 
I had no idea men 
had any control 
over that sort of 
thing, especially 
with topless erotic 
dancers grinding on their crotches. 
The lap dance was fun, but 
quiet. If there was a conversation, 
no words were involved — only 
a few developments down south. 
You’re probably supposed to just 
enjoy it and forget that the dancer 
is a human being, but a big part of 
me wanted to know who was really 
“behind the G-string.”
My mind raced with: “Do you 
feel weird that guys just stare at 
you?” and “I bet you find sex pretty 
boring, huh?” But then, five minutes 
were up. She said she had to get 
back. I blinked and said thanks. 
No orgasm, thank God. 
I’m not sure if I’m more ap -
proachable now, post-lap dance. I 
know my friends had to pay some -
one to approach me. But hey, if I can 
handle a stripper, party talks should 
be easy, right?Strip club enhances
party conversation
ERIK VOSS   AVENUE WRITER
Maybe I should’ve pulled 
the leash on my sexual 
fantasies when they 
started involving 
Broadway musical 
numbers““Singer-songwriter Rachel Goodrich isn’t fond of 
planning ahead. She said her debut album, “Tinker 
Toys,” had no direction whatsoever.
“It all came together on its own at the last min -
ute,” she said. “We just see how it untangles and 
works out.”
She said her brain is constantly thinking of ran -
dom things, and her songs are a way of letting it 
out. She has no idea what her shows will be like 
until she plays them.
“It’s not like we rehearse,” she said. “We don’t 
get together or plan it out or have any structure in 
mind. Expectations suck.”
Goodrich, 24, will perform Thursday at Orange 
and Brew in the Reitz Union. The free show, 
sponsored by the Reitz Union Board Live Bands 
Committee, begins at 8:30 p.m. 
The show is part of the Reitz Union Board’s 
Local Brew series and features two other bands: 
Sweet City Action and Making Eyes and the Toy 
Tambourine. 
Adriana Alminana, director of the Reitz Union 
Board’s bands committee, described Goodrich’s 
music as “indie rock with a fun, whimsical flare.”
“She’s a unique performer with a great live 
show,” Alminana said. “You can go there and 
know you’ll have a great time.”
Goodrich not only sings, but also plays guitar, 
percussion, ukulele, piano, banjo, kazoo and auto -
harp. She loves anything with strings and hopes to 
learn violin someday . 
“Tinker Toys” is “just a lighthearted, dark 
carnival kind of scene,” she said. “Very playful. 
Everything is creepy but you know they mean 
well.”
Goodrich said she was a quiet kid. Inspired by 
Walt Disney and Dr. Seuss, she drew sketchy char -
acters with scratchy faces before she ever created 
music. 
Growing up in Miami Beach, she was sur -rounded by bright colors, diverse 
people and new construction. 
She spent a few years studying 
music at Santa Fe College before 
she dropped out. 
In Gainesville, Goodrich loved 
to camp near natural springs and 
wander the forests late at night. 
“The land is definitely inspir -
ing,” she said. 
One time, when it was freezing cold, she and 
her friends got lost in the forest. Unable to see, they 
hoped to find their way out by lighting a shirt on 
fire.
“Some dude picked us up,” she said. “We were 
riding in his truck and there was something clunky 
underneath our seats.
“We were wondering if it was a dead body 
or something. He ended up dropping us off in a 
neighborhood. Thank God.”
Goodrich said “little adventures” are among 
her eclectic sources of inspiration. 
“Sometimes when you stare at someone too 
long, their face kind of morphs into something 
else,” she said. “That sort of inspires me.”
Other inspiration comes from books she reads, 
including the Chronicles series by Bob Dylan and a 
famous rock documentary called “The Last Waltz.” 
Her musical influences include the Beach Boys and 
the Grateful Dead.
Goodrich said she likes to stay true to herself. 
Some of her songs are blunt like “Little Brass 
Bear.”
Goodrich’s show will have some songs from 
“Tinker Toys” and others her band has yet to re -
lease. 
“It’s a lovely thing to be able to do what you 
want to do and have fun with it,” she said. “I just 
want to see what happens, you know, that’s the 
whole thing.”HENRY TAKSIER   AVENUE WRITER

UF guard Erving Walker passes the ball during the Gators’ 80-58 home win 
against Toledo on Nov. 14.
Don’t be greedy.
If Percy Harvin or 
Brandon Spikes — or both, 
for that matter — announce to -
day that they’re going to the next 
level, be proud of their achieve -
ments while wearing orange and 
blue.
Two national championships 
in three years? That’s damn 
good. What more do they have to 
prove?
It’s natural to be a bit selfish, sure, but real -
ize that if the 
juniors de -
cide they’ve 
accomplished 
all they can 
in the college 
ranks, they 
may be right.
M o t h e r s 
and fathers eventually come to 
the realization that their children 
need to leave the roost, spread 
their wings and fly away, much like your parents did when they 
sent you off to UF.
Spikes and Harvin have some 
pretty phenomenal wings.
Instead of being upset and 
screaming at them and calling 
them money-hungry jerks, re -
member the good times.
Remember the time Harvin 
tore up the Southeastern 
Conference Championship Game 
in 2006 against Arkansas with 
two touchdowns, one coming on 
a 67-yard run.Remember earlier this year 
when Spikes threw Georgia run -
ning back Knowshon Moreno to 
the ground, effectively claiming 
that game for the Gators on the 
second play.
Remember the Harvin who 
broke off an 80-yard scamper on 
the first play of the second half 
against South Carolina this year, 
then sat the rest of the game be -
cause it was a blowout.
And remember Spikes’ 
shanked punt into the south end zone stands against LSU after he 
had his first interception return 
for a touchdown at any level.
For three years, these juniors 
have put their stamp on the pro -
gram. 
Harvin’s ankles have been 
sprained and he has broken a 
few ankles of his own. Spikes has 
been through a nagging foot inju -
ry and lifted plenty of opponents 
off their feet.Fans should be thankful for time spent with Harvin, Spikes at UFUF MEN’S BASKETBALL

AUBURN, Ala. — With the first three, Erving 
Walker gave the Gators a chance, with the second, 
he gave them hope, and with the third, Walter 
Hodge delivered a win.
UF (15-2, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) knocked 
down three 3-point shots in the game’s final four 
minutes to rescue a 68-65 victory from the hands of 
defeat Wednesday night at Auburn (10-6, 0-2 SEC).
“I like taking the big shot,” Walker said. “I love 
playing with the crowd against me.”
Walker, who was limited by flu-like symptoms, 
managed to sink the game’s biggest shots and 
found Hodge for the game-win -
ner despite being depleted by the 
sickness.
“I’m dying,” Walker said after 
the game. “My throat’s killing me, 
and my body just feels cold.”
Walker, who finished with 
9 points, wanted the ball in his 
hands late in the game.
“In that situation, I wasn’t 
thinking about my sickness,” Walker said. “I knew 
we needed those shots.”
UF held a 6-point halftime lead but allowed the 
Tigers to climb back into the game with untimely 
second-half turnovers.
The Gators coughed the ball up 17 times and 
found themselves down 52-51 with just under 7 
minutes to play.
The Tigers had a chance to win the game down 
the stretch, but couldn’t close the deal from the foul 
line. Auburn shot 10 for 21 from the stripe.
“When you play on the road, you have to find 
a way to answer,” UF coach Billy Donovan said. Late threes 
save GatorsBy KYLE MAISTRI

AUBURN, Ala. — In their first two 
Southeastern Conference bouts, the Gators have 
scored the first knockdown only to have their 
opponents pick themselves up off the canvas.
Winthrop, Stetson and Longwood all 
stayed down for the proverbial 10-count, but 
this young UF squad is learning a lesson: The 
heavyweights fight back. 
In the last two games, UF has outscored its 
opponents 93-73 in the first half but has been 
outscored 60-53 in the second period.
The Gators were the first to score Wednesday 
night in Auburn and opened up a 9-point lead 
with a minute remaining in the first half. 
Freshman forward Kenny Kadji and sopho -
more forward Alex Tyus combined for 21 points 
and nine rebounds, controlling the paint against 
an undersized Tigers’ front line. 
Auburn settled for long-range shots against 
UF’s two-three zone and headed to the locker 
room after converting on just one of 13 3-point 
attempts. 
“They had a lot of open looks, to be honest,” 
UF guard Nick Calathes said. “They missed 
shots, but I thought our tempo got them tired.”
When the two teams resumed play, Calathes 
and the Gators seemed equally worn down 
from the aggressive tempo, jacking up 14 threes 
and abandoning the pick-and-roll game that led 
to easy points in the paint in the first half.
“We could have worked some possessions a 
little bit deeper to find a way to maybe go in -
side a little bit more (in the second half),” UF 
coach Billy Donovan said. “The ball was moved 
around the perimeter, and we never had any -
thing going to the basket. We settled posses -
sions where it looked like we were trying to win 
the game from the 3-point line.”
For a while it looked as though UF might lose Second-half

Former UF guard Depree Bowden shoots during the Gators’ 69-65 loss 
to South Carolina in the O’Connell Center on Feb. 24.
By CHRISTOPHER YAZBEC
Alligator Writer
cyazbec@alligator.org
It might be used as added 
motivation, or it might just be 
a painful memory from last sea-
son.
When the No. 19 UF wom-
en’s basketball team (15-2, 1-1 
Southeastern Conference) trav-
els to Columbia, S.C., to take on 
South Carolina (8-7, 0-2 SEC) tonight at 7, they will likely be reminded of what could have been a year ago.
The Gators sat on the NCAA 
Tournament bubble for much of conference play last season, and each game was as important as 
the next in determining their 
chances of making the 64-team field.
On Senior Day, UF’s final reg-
ular-season home game, South 
Carolina came to Gainesville 
and spoiled the ceremony, win-ning 69-65 in a game UF didn’t expect to lose.
The Gators’ lone senior and 
team leader, Depree Bowden, didn’t get the exit she wanted, but the loss might have cost her team more.
While losing to the 
Gamecocks was not the only reason the Gators were left out of the NCAA Tournament, it did 
not help their cause.
In the end, UF had to settle for 
a Women’s National Invitation Tournament berth and was 
left wondering whether a win against South Carolina could 
have made the difference in its 
postseason fate.
The Gators redeemed them-
selves in the SEC Tournament, defeating the Gamecocks 71-57, 
but it was too little, too late.
The earlier loss to South 
Carolina was likely the final 
dagger in UF’s tournament 
hopes last year.
“It’s hard to forget some 
things like that, losses that 
maybe kept us out of the NCAA 
Tournament, a disappointing se-
nior night for Depree Bowden,” UF coach Amanda Butler said. “I hope that maybe they’ll get some extra motivation from 
that.”
This time around, both teams 
will have a different look.
South Carolina has a new 
coach and is without 3-point 
shooting threat Jordan Jones. 
Jones torched the Gators in 
their loss last year, shooting 5 of 9 from 3-point range and scoring 16 points to lead the Gamecocks in their upset.
The reason she won’t be play-
ing: Jones transferred to UF and is currently sitting out until next year due to NCAA transfer rules.
Butler could not be happier 
knowing Jones is on her side now, but she is also aware that South Carolina is far from a pushover.
“They’ve played an incred-
ible non-conference schedule, probably one of the toughest non-conference schedules in the country,” Butler said. “Their re-
cord is in no way an indication 
of how good they are or how good they can be.”
The Gamecocks’ two confer -
ence losses came at the hands of No. 6 Auburn by 4 points and at Georgia by 6.
UF  is coming off its first 
loss (at Auburn by 16) after 15 
straight wins and is looking to 
rebound by capturing its first SEC road win.
“The biggest part of it is, 
we’re going to South Carolina, and they’re hungry for their first SEC win,” Butler said. 
“So we’re going to have to be 
ready.”
As long as their memories 
don’t fail them, the Gators should know now not to take not even the weakest team for 
granted. 
Doing so could be costly.Gators look to avenge loss
“Walker’s two threes were 
big. That really helped us hold down the fort late.”
The Gators went 5 of 23 
from 3-point range, but came up perfect with the game on the line.
After having their back 
broken on the boards by Mississippi, the UF frontcourt may have finally found its spine.
The Gators were punished 
on the glass by a Rebels team that, at the time, had the worst rebounding margin in the con-ference.
UF outrebounded Auburn 
46-36 and may have won back some of the pride it had given 
away to Mississippi.
“We had some tough prac-
tices after that game, and we 
know that needs to be our fo-cus,” Alex Tyus said.
While Kenny Kadji has 
struggled to find consistency this season, he showed once again he can provide the 
Gators with another solid 
option inside. The freshman scored 11 points and grabbed eight boards, had two steals and blocked two shots in the win.
“As long as (Kadji’s) mind 
is right, he’s a really good player,” Tyus said. “He’s re-ally starting to come along.”
Eloy Vargas saw what may 
have been the first mean-ingful minutes of his career 
Wednesday.
The freshman came off the 
bench in the first half to score 
2 points and snatch two re-bounds.
“We wanted 
to play Vargas 
more, but it was 
just hard for us, matchup wise,” Donovan said.
Nick Calathes 
led the Gators in scoring with 17 points.
The win was Donovan’s 
300th as the coach of the Gators.
“It’s tough in this league,” 
Donovan said. “Every night is a constant battle.”
According to UF Sports 
Information Director Fred Demarest, freshman forward Allen Chaney did not make the trip to Auburn with the 
rest of the team because of 
back spasms. He is prob-able for UF’s game against Arkansas at home Saturday.Frontcourt stands tall
the game from the 3-point line, as Kadji and Tyus com-
bined for just five shot attempts in the second half. 
Just like Mississippi before it, Auburn battled back 
from an early deficit, but the Tigers were able to do something the Rebels couldn’t — take the lead.  
“They gave us the opportunity to put them away ,” 
Calathes said. “We definitely could’ve put them away earlier.”
The Gators leaned heavily on their sophomore 
playmaker to push, distribute and take care of the ball, something Calathes only lived up to in the first 20 minutes. 
Before the break, he scored 11 points and dished 
out four assists without turning the ball over a single time. In the second half, he had as many turnovers as points and added only one assist to his total. 
“Your team is going to go, offensively, as your 
point guard goes, and Nick turned it over six times,” 
Donovan said. 
If Donovan’s team is going to start putting away 
conference foes, Calathes can’t be leading the team to 
a 17-giveaway performance.
“My fault,” Calathes said. “I turned the ball over 
way too much, forcing things, but I think we hit big shots at the end.”
Any decisions these two make 
will have been thoroughly thought 
out. 
They’re not going to make de-
cisions as serious as this one in a heartbeat — Urban Meyer wouldn’t let them. Meyer has undoubtedly 
put Harvin and Spikes in contact 
with NFL coaches and analysts who will inform the two of their best op-tions.
Besides, The Gator Nation should 
be thankful it still has at least Tim Tebow. My roommate told me Wednesday that, two weeks ago, he would have been thrilled with just Tebow returning, would have been 
ecstatic if two juniors stayed, and 
would have “crapped my pants” should all three come back.
Every college program in the 
country is jealous of the success Harvin and Spikes have had in Gainesville. 
How much would FSU have 
loved to land the two of them three 
years ago? Where would Oklahoma 
or Ohio State or West Virginia be right now with that duo added to its roster?
No, don’t be mad if you get some 
sad news today.Be proud of Harvin and Spikes.  
Be happy with the time you shared.
And if, somehow, Gainesville 
gets some unbelievable news today — Harvin and Spikes are staying for their senior years — then un-
derstand how truly lucky you are. 
Talents like them using up all four years of their eligibility nowadays are extremely rare. If this trio pulls a Noah-Horford-Brewer-Green, you’ll 
be witnessing one of the greatest 
acts of school spirit trumping mil-lions in history.
You’ll get to see them flap their 
wings one more time and soar over all of college football.UF again relies on Calathes’ playmaking

The stars weren’t aligned for Florida 
Community College at Jacksonville against 
Santa Fe College on Wednesday night.
The Saints came out on top 71-63 
over the Stars in the teams’ Mid-Florida 
Conference openers. 
The Saints (15-4, 1-0 MFC) are coming 
off two straight seasons of winning the 
MFC Championship and have a 25-1 re -
cord in their last 26 MFC games.  
The Stars were well aware of that going 
into the game.
“It’s our first conference game,” said 
Stars coach Neil Orr.  “Probably against 
the best team in the entire conference.”
The Stars shined throughout the game, 
including during their 10-0 run in the sec -
ond half to chip away at the Saints’ lead 
and come within 6 points.  
SFC sophomore guard Aaron Holmes 
ended that run when he scored back-to-
back 3-pointers to keep the Saints march -
ing on.  
But when it was all said and done, the 
Stars were unable to provide the defense 
necessary to win.“I don’t think we matched their intensi -
ty on the defensive end,” Orr said.  “We’ll 
come back with more intensity for the next 
game, I guarantee you that.”
FCCJ substituted players multiple times 
throughout the game. Eleven of the Stars’ 
14 players listed on the roster saw time 
Wednesday.
Orr and the other FCCJ coaches contin -
ued to push their team on the court, yell -
ing “pressure” and calling plays from the 
sidelines.
Stars freshman guard Jimmy Gaskins Jr. 
was perfect from the free-throw line, mak -
ing four shots and contributing 12 points.
Holmes, who will play at Tulane next 
season, provided the Saints with 21 points.  He shot 60 percent from the free-throw line 
and added 9 points from long distance.For 
the season, Holmes averages 21.6 points 
per game and typically goes 77 percent 
from the free-throw line.
“Aaron did a nice job knocking down 
his threes,” said SFC coach Chris Mowry. 
“He’s a very talented player.”
Holmes and teammates Roderick 
Emanuel, Julien Bendeke and Jon Nolton 
all scored in double digits for the game. 
SFC managed to balance its scoring 
drives and pass the ball around to differ -
ent players.
Bendeke, a non-starter, was 3 of 4 from 
the 3-point line and finished with 10 
points. 
Marvin Davis also came off the bench to 
provide 7 points for the team.
“Our guys on the bench are very good 
players and are capable of scoring,” Mowry 
said.  “We have a deep bench. Game in and 
game out, they continue to step up.”
SFC managed 19 offensive rebounds 
and 26 defensive rebounds throughout the 
game, which Orr noticed.
“We didn’t do a good job with second 
shots,” Orr said.  “Second shots killed us, 
and that’s my fault.”SFC will travel to Sanford to continue 
MFC play against Seminole Community 
College at 4 p.m. on  Saturday.
“We have to come out and play hard 
for 40 minutes,” Mowry said.  “We need to 
continue to bring intensity.”20, ALLIGATOR   THURSDAY, JANUARY 15, 2009
