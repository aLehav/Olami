UF is ranked in the top 75 for new sign-ups 
for a sugar daddy dating website in 2012.
SeekingArrangement.com provides a place 
for sugar daddies to get to know sugar babies 
looking for someone to take care of them. A sug-ar daddy is a wealthy man, and in this case, he is paying for a female’s college tuition.
UF ranked No. 41 on the list. Four other Flor-
ida universities were listed in SeekingArrange-ment.com’s top 20 fastest-growing sugar baby universities. The site’s public relations manager, Jennifer Gwynn, said UF has a total of 186 stu-dents participating, with 64 registered in 2012.

UF came away from Wednesday and 
Thursday’s Board of Governors meetings 
without a new trustee to ﬁ  ll the vacancy , but administrators didn’t leave empty-handed.
UF was one of four Florida universities to 
receive awards after applying for a technolo-gy performance funding pilot about computer science and information-technology-related degree programs. UF, the University of Cen-tral Florida, Florida International University and the University of West Florida will each get $3.75 million.
Provost Joe Glover said the money will 
likely come with instructions on how it can be spent.
“There are many, many areas that contrib-
uted to UF winning this money . . . the College of Engineering, the College of Liberal Arts and Scienc-es, even the College of Fine Arts,” he said. “So they will share in the beneﬁ  ts of it. Exactly how the money gets 
split up and how it gets used remains to be seen.”
Later on Thursday , the 
Board of Governors appointed seven people to various universities’ boards of trustees. But UF was not among them.
Vice chair Morteza “Mori” Hosseini said 
the board delayed UF’s trustee appointment because there was not enough time to ﬁ  nish reviewing the applications.
“We’re going to make sure we have 
enough in the pool, so we can select the best,” he said.

Christine Hoffman smiled and 
pinched her ear lobes.
“A dollar ﬁ  fty at Forever 21,” the 
21-year-old economics junior said.
Hoffman wore pearl earrings on her fourth day as a student assistant 
at Warrington College of Business, and she was already making more than the assistant from last semes-ter.
Florida employees started the 
new year with a 12-cent wage bump. The per hour minimum wage rate rose from $7.67 to $7.79 on Jan. 1.
According to the U.S. Depart-
ment of Labor, the rate in Florida increases annually based on a cost-of-living formula. Florida is one of 10 states that raised the minimum wage in 2013.
The rate is higher than the feder-
al minimum wage, $7.25 per hour.
Wantanisha Morant, ﬁ  nancial aid coordinator at UF, said the aver-age student works 20 hours a week. Under the new rate, students earn an extra $2.40 each week, she said.
Although minimum wage is on 
the rise, an additional Medicare tax has also gone into effect. The 0.9 percent rate of additional Medicare tax applies to wages and compen-sation for individuals ﬁ  ling single status making $200,000, according to the Internal Revenue Service.
Joshua Acree, a 21-year-old 
psychology senior, has worked at Chick-ﬁ  l-A for more than a year. Although he makes above mini-mum wage, he approved of the in-crease.
“I think it’s great, especially 
for college students that need the money to pay for school,” he said. “Every dollar matters.”

Libraries celebrate Florida’s 
QuincentennialThe expeditions of Juan Ponce de León in 1513 and 1521 opened Spanish explo-ration of what became the southeastern United States and started efforts to bring Florida into Spain’s colonial empire. To celebrate 500 years of this great state, the George A. Smathers Libraries will present the exhibit “Florida 1513 – 2013: A Quincentennial Commemoration.” On view from Thursday through March 15, the exhibit features a series of vignettes highlighting some Prankster registered as ‘Obama’
PITTSBURGH — A Pennsyl-
vania detective is trying to figure out how a prankster was able to fill out a 2008 voter registration card signed “Barack H. Obama.”
Butler County Detective Scott 
Roskovski said nobody voted us-ing the bogus voter registration card, though filling it out falsely could be a felony.
Elections officials in the coun-
ty north of Pittsburgh had pro-cessed the card, and it went into the state’s computerized database with the last name “Obana” — that is, with an “n’’ in place of the “m.” 
But Roskovski said whoever 
did it was clearly trying to register using President Barack Obama’s name.
The card was discovered last 
week when a jury commissioner was compiling a list of potential jurors, which can be drawn from voter-registration lists.

While he was in the Marine 
Corps, Tom Huffman needed to 
find a way to defend himself from the other soldiers.
He looked to karate but wanted a 
more peaceful approach. Instead, he chose aikido and decided to spread his knowledge to Gainesville resi-dents.
“Aikido is more defense than of-
fense,” Huffman said. “You don’t really want to hurt the person, but you want them to think that you’re not a person they want to mess with.”
Huffman, a 59-year-old fourth-
degree black belt in aikido, teaches the martial art for the Aikido De-fense of Gainesville at the Unified Training Center, 809 W. University Ave.
Starting this year, Huffman said 
he will offer free defense and anti-bullying classes Thursdays from 7:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the center.
Before he got involved in his 
27-year career in aikido, Huffman served in the Marines and later transferred to the Navy.
Wanting to learn Iwama-style 
aikido, Huffman took classes at Sunset Cliffs Aikido in 1986 while stationed in San Diego, Calif. He later asked for a transfer to Japan, so he could learn more defense art techniques.
He later retired from the Navy 
and moved to Gainesville to go to college, which he didn’t do after he graduated from high school. 
He said college wasn’t for him at 
the time.
“I barely passed senior year,” he 
said.
Growing up, Huffman said he 
loved playing in his school band, and when the time came for him to go back to school, he knew he want-ed go to a college that had a good band. He chose UF.
“Some of my friends came here 
to play in the band,” he said. “Mov-ing to Gainesville was my fool-around year.”However, UF did not accept his 
military credits, which led him to spend two years at Santa Fe Col-lege, pursuing his associate degree in business.
In 1998, he started the Aikido 
Club at SFC, which he still teaches for during the week to this day — when he is not at the Unified Train-ing Center.
Huffman was eventually accept-
ed into UF, where he taught at the UF Aikido Club. He later graduated in 2001 with a degree in finance.
After graduating, Huffman con-
tinued teaching classes, and he was approached by a woman who asked him if he needed teaching space.
Huffman eventually found 
space at the Unified Training Cen-ter and opened Aikido Defense of Gainesville in 2002.
Future plans for Huffman and 
his aikido defense program include more public demonstrations, semi-nars and creating DVDs and videos of him teaching high-power aikido techniques, he said.
Because his classes take place 
within Innovation Square, he said there is a chance that the Unified Training Center building may be bought out in the next year or so.
At that point, Huffman said he 
and his team will look for another, cheaper location to continue their classes.
“Aikido is a way of living,” he 
said. “We interact and learn how to work together, rather than against each other.”

Sensei Tom Huffman, a fourth-degree black belt in Iwama and Nishio styles of aikido, practices iaido at the 
Unified Training Center on Thursday. Iaido is the art of drawing and manipulating the Japanese sword. Adult classes are held Mondays and Wednesdays at 7:30 p.m. Free classes are held each Thursday at 7:30 p.m.

Gwynn said most women join be-
cause they would like someone to take care of them and help pay for school.
“The average allowance is about 
$3,000 a month for most college stu-dents,” she said. “It’s just like any other relationship. There just happens to be a financial component involved.”
The list was created through the web-
site’s database of female students who registered with their universities’ email addresses. The students who registered with the addresses receive premium membership. Sugar babies are not re-quired to be in college; however, they must be 18 or older.
Virginia Stanton, an 18-year-old eco-
nomics freshman, said it’s a smart idea, but it devalues what love is all about.
Florida’s economy contributes to the 
amount of Florida colleges on the list, Gwynn said
“You always hear about Florida be-
ing one of the top states for foreclosures and unemployment,” she said. 
Georgia State University ranked No. 
1 for new sugar baby sign ups in 2012.

At first, it was cute, lucky even. 
The little red beetle with black pol-
ka dots on its back poked about the building. It buzzed above students and whirled up the stairwells. Then it brought its friends.
Ladybugs have invaded the 
dorms on UF’s campus. Though they’re considered friends of the garden, at student residence halls, they’re not exactly welcome.
“It’s more annoying than it is a 
severe issue,” said Chana Camachl, an 18-year-old biology freshman.
Camachl lives at Lakeside Resi-
dential Complex. She said the little beetles have made a home out of the area’s common rooms and halls. They wriggle around door-knobs and windowsills, roaming from room to room.
Darrin Qualls, an 18-year-old 
psychology freshman, lives in Beaty Towers. He said the bugs buzz about his room — benevolent but bothersome.“They’re pretty much every-
where,” Qualls said.
Sharon Blansett, UF housing spokeswoman, wrote in an email that around this time of year, la-dybugs can be found in large quantities on the south sides of UF residence facilities and other build-ings. The bugs are seeking warm locations as it cools down outside.
“If they find cracks in the walls, 
or unsealed areas around AC units or other pipes and wires going into buildings, they will get inside,” Blansett said.
UF entomology professor Nor-
man Leppla said the ladybugs students are encountering in their rooms are probably multicolored Asian lady beetles.
Leppla is also director of the 
Integrated Pest Management pro-gram, which uses a sustainable approach to managing pests. He said the bugs are not harmful to humans, but rather, are beneficial predators that feed on smaller pests.
Blansett said if students notice 
the bugs in their rooms, they’re en-couraged to report them through the online iServiceDesk. Mainte-nance employees will then come and vacuum the bugs out of the room.
She said no chemicals are used 
to treat this type of insect.4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, JANUARY 18, 2013

UF students and Gainesville residents 
who ride the bus will have to find anoth-
er way to get around town Monday.
All of the 92 Regional Transit System 
buses will be closed in observance of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday , said RTS spokesman Chip Skinner.
“That’s part of our union negotia-
tion, so Martin Luther King Day is one of those holidays where we shut down the whole service,” he said.
Diyonne McGraw, vice president 
of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Commis-sion of Florida, said the King Celebra-tion Annual Commemorative March on Monday is expected to leave from Bo Diddley Plaza, travel east on University Avenue and continue on Waldo Road to the MLK Multi-Purpose Center, 1028 NE 14th St. 
Skinner said traffic will be halted as 
the parade marches to the center.
“The closures will be moving as the 
parade does,” he said. “Expect closures from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.”
RTS services will resume normal bus 
service Tuesday. McGraw said people who rely on the bus system can catch a ride Monday.
“We have about 10 churches that of-
fer shuttles,” she said. “People can park at the MLK [Multi-]Purpose Center at 9 a.m. to go Downtown.”RTS bus service changes COLLEEN WRIGHT

Castillo said he was approached by the par -
ty to run for office. He said he only considered running for president.
Castillo, who served as treasurer and sec-
retary on the College of Liberal Arts and Sci-ences Student Council, said he could relate to students and their concerns.
“I am your normal student,” he said. “I can 
make you really, truly believe in this college.”

A Gainesville woman was arrested Wednes-
day afternoon after a Kmart manager caught 
her sniffing aerosol in a store bathroom.
Alachua County Sheriff’s Office deputies 
arrested Linda Thompson Roberts, 43, of 9624 SW First Place, on inhaling/ingesting harmful chemicals and possession of harmful chemicals charges, according to an ASO arrest report.
At about 6 p.m. Wednesday, Norma Q. 
Shayhorn, the store manager, heard Roberts spraying an aerosol can inside a bathroom at the Kmart store, located on the 900 block of Northwest 76th Blvd.
When Shayhorn walked into the bathroom, 
she found Roberts passed out on the floor. Deputies later arrived to the scene to speak with Roberts after she woke up.
During an interview with deputies, Rob-
erts wore dark sunglasses, swayed back and forth, and  slurred her words as she spoke, according to the re-port.
After her arrest, Roberts 
told deputies she’d been 
“huffing” for a couple of weeks to deal with back pain, according to the re-
port.
Deputies later booked Roberts at the Alach-
ua County Jail, where she remained Thursday night with a $30,000 bond.

Students, residents and business owners 
are no longer the only ones standing around 
downtown Gainesville.
Six sculptures have been recently installed 
outside of local stores as part of a new com-munity initiative.
The sculptures are on loan and will remain 
in Gainesville for two years, said Nava Otten-berg, who owns Persona Vintage Clothing & Costumes.
A public art event was held Tuesday to re-
veal the sculptures to the public. City commis-sioners and more than 50 community mem-bers attended the ribbon-cutting ceremony and walking tour.
“This is a community project,” said activist 
Mary Rockwood Lane. “People wanted to see something interesting happen in their com-munity , and everyone got together and made it happen.”
A rooster sculpture now stands in front of 
the downtown Starbucks. It was sculpted by Peruvian artist Victor Delfín in 1960. Delfín also created a stag sculpture, which was placed in front of Persona Vintage Clothing & Costumes.
The stag and rooster were loaned by Euph-
rosyne Parker, who allowed pieces to be bor -
rowed from her late husband’s art collection.
In addition, two sculptures by David Bell, 
titled “Love Palm” and “Starburst,” stand in between Dragonfly and Mark’s Prime Steak-house.
Ottenberg said the project was about inte-
grating art and culture into downtown urban spaces.
“The whole idea was to bring public art 
into the heart of downtown Gainesville,” she said.
Ottenberg, along with Rockwood Lane, 
were part of a group that spearheaded the ef-fort to exhibit the sculptures.
Rockwood Lane said they demonstrate the 
American modern genre.
“Most of it is very abstract and modern,” 
she said. “The sculptures go together beauti-fully.”FRIDAY, JANUARY 18, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

� DIET SODA DRINKERS WERE 
FOUND TO BE AT A HIGHER RISK.
ANDREW KAYS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Katelyn Zanchetta rarely drinks coffee 
and soda.
After hearing about a recent study that 
found a relationship between drinking 
soda or coffee and depression, she will continue her ways.
“That definitely won’t change my 
drinking habits,” said the 20-year-old nursing sophomore. 
The study, released last week, com-
piled data from about 260,000 partici-pants aged 50 to 71 regarding their drink-ing habits from 1995 to 1996. Recently, the researchers surveyed the participants again to determine how many had been diagnosed with depression.
The results, supported by the National 
Institutes of Health, found participants who consumed heavily sweetened drinks such as fruit punch and soda were at an about 30 percent higher risk of depression than those who didn’t. Drinkers of diet beverages were at an even higher risk.
However, those who drank significant 
amounts of coffee — more than four cups a day — were at a 10 percent lower risk than non-coffee drinkers.
“It’s kind of an odd study,” said Wen-
dy Dahl, an assistant professor in UF’s food science and human nutrition depart-ment. “It’s interesting to choose a 50-to-71 age bracket. You wouldn’t think they would be the primary soda drinkers.”
The study stated the association of de-
pression risk with sugary drinks or coffee did not necessarily mean one causes the other.
“One of the limits of a [long-term] 
study is you can’t do a cause-and-effect relationship. There are so many factors in-volved with humans,” Dahl said, “but the large sample for the study is very helpful for that.”Study finds sugary drinks

Vernon was in charge of recruiting vol-
unteers for his event, Kids Count, at Faith United Methodist Church.
“Young and old people are coming 
from all over Gainesville,” he said.
The Day of Service starts at 8 a.m. It encourages students to reflect on 
King’s values while making an impact in the world around them.
UF’s Martin Luther King Jr. Celebra-
tion Week is in its sixth year of existence as a campus-wide committee, said UF’s Director of Intercultural Engagement Jar -
rod Cruz.
Cruz said the event is based on seven 
values: courage, truth, justice, compas-sion, dignity, humility and service.
UF’s campus community provides an 
opportunity for students to get outside their comfort zones and break down ste-reotypes and views, he said.
The goal, Cruz said, is to “create change 
on campus … even when we leave UF.”
The celebration’s signature events in-
clude the Day of Service, Ain’t I a Woman!, 
a candlelight vigil and a speech from the keynote speaker, author Michael Eric Dyson.
One of the celebration’s 
new events is Channeling Your Inner Rosa Parks: Women’s Activism Then and Now. 
Cruz said the Wom-
en’s Student Association hopes to empow-er women and raise awareness through this event.
Vernon, along with all the volunteers 
he recruited, waits in anticipation to kick off the celebration.
“I’m excited,” he said. “I’ve never expe-
rienced that in my life before.”

There were a lot of lessons to learn this week. For one, be pre-
pared for literally any kind of weather here in Gainesville. Second, always read something you’re confused about 
just one more time.

Poor Manti Te’o. He’s a football player at Notre Dame. 
After learning of the deaths of his grandmother and his girlfriend in practically the same day, he continued to play his hardest and lead the team to a 20-3 victory over Michi-gan State. What an inspiring story! His girlfriend, Lennay Kekua, was in a car crash and was later diagnosed with leukemia. We give a keep-on-truckin’-dude LAUREL to 
Manti Te‘o.
Here’s the thing: Kekua never existed. Reporters discov-
ered no medical or death records of Kekua, or any record of a car accident or any education records of her “time” at Stanford University. Te’o was full on “catﬁ  shed.” A state-ment from the university and Te’o said they learned of the hoax in late December, but when an article was published on Deadspin this week, the Internet ate it up, which forced the university to speak on the issue. We give a if-only-you-didn’t-pull-a-classic-Catholic-cover-up-or-date-a-fake-girl-or-pretend-to-be-someone-on-the-Internet DART to 
Notre Dame, Te’o and the alleged Kekua.
Remember Mohawk Guy? He stole our hearts when the 
Mars rover Curiosity stole … the surface of Mars and other science stuff. Well, in honor of his next mission, attending the presidential inauguration, Bobak Ferdowsi will unveil a new hairdo. He won’t tell us what it is, just that it’ll be “something fun.” We give a you-make-us-want-to-learn-about-science-more-maybe LAUREL to Bobak Ferdowsi. 
We should also deﬁ  nitely want to study that stuff any-way.
As college students, we probably understand the val-
ue of a dollar a little more, now that they’re few and far between. Imagine our disgust when we learned that Sub-way, a sort-of beloved sandwich restaurant, has potentially been keeping us from our full sandwich potential. Some-one posted a photo on the company’s Facebook page that showed one of the “foot long sandwiches next to a tape measure that shows the sub is just 11 inches,” according to an ABC News article. We give a GIVE-US-OUR-MONEY’S-WORTH-OF-SANDWICH-OR-ELSE-WE’LL-REVOLT DART to Subway. Now that the whole country’s seen Les 
Mis, we’re pretty prepared for a revolution.
Our thoughts are with Aurora, Colo., as the movie the-
ater where a gunman killed 12 people reopened this week. As the site of a mass shooting and one of the catalysts of the current gun control discussion in this country, it can’t be easy trying to move on and move past the tragic events of that night. We give a you’ll-never-read-this-but-your-fellow-Americans-still-feel-for-you LAUREL to Aurora.
That city, and every other city where a mass shooting 
happened when it was completely unnecessary, and the people who live there are who we should be really be fo-cusing on. We can only hope that new legislation will be the impetus of a healthy change of the attitude in America.
Be safe, and have a good week!
Be mindful of everyone on the roads
Before reading this column, I encourage you to look up 
the selective attention test of Daniel Simons and Chris-topher Chabris. (An Internet search of “selective atten-
tion test” should return it as a result.)
The test is a video that runs for about a minute and gauges 
the effects of a person’s attention while performing a simple task.
The lesson of the test is that divided attention, even when 
performing a very simple task, can keep people from seeing what is right in front of them.
It is with this in mind that I want to turn your attention to 
the relationship between cars and bicycles.
I can recall having read a gruesome column in the Alliga-
tor as a freshman cyclist. The column detailed the traumatic experience of another Gainesville cyclist.
“I awoke bloody and in sharp pain at 2:25 a.m. on Sept. 4. 
I couldn’t tell you what city I lived in, what my name was or what happened.
What I do remember is shoving my jaw back into place, 
spitting blood into the street and watching all the sparkling headlights ﬂ  ying past me without hesitating to see if I was OK. My concussion made the truth blurry, but from my bruises and broken bones, it seemed I was clipped by a ve-hicle on my bicycle.”
That image has lingered with me for almost four years 
and has almost certainly saved me from danger. It has caused me to create habits of safety . I always wear a helmet, look both ways and often even wait to make eye contact with drivers on the road before I move.
Lately though, I’ve found it harder to make eye contact 
with drivers. Instead of having their eyes ﬁ  xed on the road, I will often see stopped drivers looking down at their phones and texting. This is a dangerous habit. This habit kills peo-ple.
In 2009, more than 5,400 people died in accidents involv-
ing a distracted driver, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Let that sink in for a moment.I’m going to assume you’ve taken the selective attention test by now. The punch line of the test, so to speak, is that a gorilla walks in halfway through the test, thumps his chest and walks off screen. This comes as a complete surprise to about half of those who watch the video. 
When I took the test, I didn’t 
see the gorilla either. He seemed to come out of nowhere. I was dis-tracted — and I just wasn’t look-
ing for a gorilla.
Let’s take a more complex action like driving. What would 
happen if you were only looking for cars and nothing else? Would you see a cyclist?
What if you were distracted by music? Would that hinder 
your ability to avoid hurting someone?
What about talking on the phone? What about texting?What about driving under the inﬂ  uence of alcohol? That 
killed about 10,000 people in 2010, which is about as many homicides with ﬁ  rearms in the same year. 
Most people who set out to travel don’t do it with the in-
tention of hurting someone. Someone’s ﬂ  irty text, or some-one’s jamming out on air guitar or someone’s night out club-bing can turn into a lost life.
What about just simple aggressive driving? I’ve been 
a passenger and witnessed drivers lumber around in their engines of destruction, ﬂ  opping their cars about when they get frustrated, in the most careless fashion. It’s just not ac-ceptable.
Many bikers also engage in risky behavior, which is 
equally unacceptable.
We should all be more careful on the road and keep a look-
out for each other. We all just want to get where we’re going. Let’s try to make that happen with as little pain as possible.
The text can wait.

To the executives at E! Entertainment 
Television,
Greetings.
It is with heavy heart that I pen this let-
ter, for I am deeply disappointed with the preliminary tapes I received of my show, “What Would Ryan Lochte Do?” Further-more, I am concerned with the way I, Ryan Lochte, am represented as an athlete, co-median, actor, and connoisseur of fashion and footwear with this network.
I hope the executives, directors and 
production staff will take my concerns to heart, as it appears no one at this network seems to recognize humor in the form of satire and irony. Apparently, the insuf-ferable personalities of the Kardashians and Ryan Seacrest have understandably numbed you all.
I digress.I am tired of wasting my comedic ge-
nius on a satirical Twitter account that is wrongly perceived to be sincere.
I am tired of my pithy catchphrase, 
“Jeah,” being bastardized on unironic frat tanks worn by America’s drunken youth.  
I am tired of suffering in silence as the punch line to society’s jokes while Michael  Phelps is allowed a serious career as a stu-dent to Tiger Woods in his pursuit to mas-ter golf. I ask, E!, where is my mentor?
Why is Phelps offered assistance in his 
switch from swimmer to golfer, and I am refused a switch from swimmer to actor?
When is it Ryan’s turn?I suffered through my appearances on 
“90210” and various “Funny or Die” vid-eos in hopes that my natural ability as a ﬁ  ne thespian would be recognized by more important directors, but no.  
Instead of receiving offers for serious 
projects, I am shoved into the ranks of the Kardashian family, the forgotten other Jo-nas Brother, Ice-T and Ryan Seacrest.
I’m sick and tired of continual pun-
ishment and mockery simply for being young, beautiful and enjoying a night out every once in a while. 
I spent many hours with the crew re-
hearsing my show in one act, “Chlorine Dreams and Ripped Speedo Seams,” but I saw nary a mention of my foray into play writing on the tapes.
In addition, my extensive contributions to the Derek Zoolander School for Kids Who Can’t Read Good and Wanna Learn to do Other Stuff Good Too were largely ignored, as was the album I recorded in my home studio of classic movie themes performed on the recorder.
All of this, of course, was on top of my 
rigorous training and pursuit of true life in various clubs in downtown Gainesville.
For shame, E!, for shame!I was also troubled by the statements 
I read in the Washington Post last week from E! Entertainment President Suzanne Kolb.
Kolb said, “Watching this show, I be-
lieve people will fall into three categories: they want to be him, sleep with him or mother him.”
I found it incredibly rude and insensi-
tive that Kolb would try to foist an image of me as a conceited, promiscuous boor with an Oedipus complex on the Ameri-can public. 
I was told this reality show would be a 
chance for my fans to catch a glimpse into the deep waters of my complicated psyche and see me not as a paltry Nike designer or Olympic medal-ist but as an artist.
As Ralph Waldo 
Emerson said, “To create, — to create, — is the proof of a divine presence.” I am only striving for that divinity, 
and I am hurt that this network has made a mockery of my attempts to become a se-rious actor.
Due to contractual obligations, I sup-
pose there is not a thing I can do. I will continue to suffer the pains of being attrac-tive and talented.
Only in my art will I ﬁ  nd solace. As 
acclaimed American acting teacher Stella Adler said, “Life beats down and crushes the soul, and art reminds you that you have one.”
Jeah.Signed,Ryan S. Lochte

He created the kind of pub where everybody knows your 
name.
Gar Hoflund, owner of Stubbies & Steins Pub and retired 
UF chemical engineering professor, passed away Tuesday 
from sudden health problems. He was 65.
Hoflund retired in September. He had worked at UF since 
1977 and specialized in surface science.
“Overall, he was such a caring human being, cared not 
only about his own students but others he ran into around Gainesville,” said his daughter Amy Bryce Hoflund.
Although he is known for his engineering contribu-
tions, he is also famous for bringing craft beer to downtown Gainesville with his other daughter, Berkeley Hoflund.
They opened Stubbie Shirt Pub, later known as Stubbies 
& Steins, in 2003. 
The pub became the premier spot for craft beer in down-
town Gainesville. Opening with a selection of 60 craft and imported beers, Stubbies & Steins grew to serve about 400 beers, which kept the regulars coming.
Berkeley Hoflund said her dad loved beer T-shirts.“Anyone who knows my dad knew he was a T-shirt-and-
shorts kind of guy,” she said.
She said she plans to continue playing classic rock and 
serving craft beer, the way her father did when he owned it. 
As a child, she bonded with her father in his lab at UF. She 
remembered going with him to do science experiments and play with the beakers.
“He was always really supportive when I did my school 
science projects,” Berkeley Hoflund said. “That was always so much fun.”
Amy Bryce Hoflund remembers her father as a man who 
loved travel, food and wine, heavy metal and Corvettes. She said her father’s lifelong passion for chemical engineer -
ing came after dismantling and rebuilding his Corvette as a 16-year-old in Sioux City, Iowa.
“He had such an open mind and was so intellectually curi-
ous,” Amy Bryce Hoflund said.
Richard Dickinson, chair for the chemical engineering de-
partment, wrote in an email that everyone was fond of Ho-flund.
“Gar was an extremely popular, warm, good-natured, ad-
venturous person,” he said. “He was very passionate about his science, and several of the graduate students he trained during his 35 years in the department went on to be quite successful.”
Gar Hoflund is survived by his longtime companion Lynn 
Sullivan, daughters, stepdaughters Ali and Jenny Burns, and son-in-law David Bilek.

Gators basketball fans have the chance to check 
off the ultimate bucket list item: spend the night 
in the Stephen C. O’Connell Center.
After the 7 p.m. gymnastics meet against Mis-
souri Friday, UF students are invited to camp out on the practice court before the Gators men’s bas-ketball team takes on the Mizzou Tigers at 2 p.m. Saturday.
Jake Sillick, a 24-year-old computer and elec-
trical engineering student, said he usually camps out for big games such as Tennessee and Kentucky outside. People would bring blankets and tents.
He said camping out inside for the upcoming 
game is very exciting.
“It’s a great gesture to have the University Ath-
letic Association have it inside,” said Sillick, the Men’s Basketball Rowdies president.
The first 500 campers to enter the O’Dome 
starting at 5:30 p.m. on Friday will be provided with pizza at Gate 3, according to a press release, as well as breakfast Saturday morning.
To pass time, video games, movies and games 
will be set up at the free event.
Lucas Dolengowski, a 20-year-old telecommu-
nication sophomore, said he will be attending the camp out because it will be a cool experience.
The tag line for all sport events at the O’Connell 
Center is “Live Life in the Dome.”
Dolengowski said the UAA is giving students 
the opportunity to actually do so.
“They’re making that true to form,” he said.Live life in the

Macaulay gazed at a set of potted 
trees set to be given away Thursday outside the Senior Recreation Center in northwest Gainesville.“I want one of those,” Macaulay , 
73, said, pointing at a southern mag-nolia. “It’s already green!”
She and Jellema, 76, were among 
about 50 attendees at the center who celebrated Florida Arbor Day, a holiday that encourages residents statewide to plant and take care of trees in their communities.
Presented by the City of 
Gainesville Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs Department, the city’s Beautification Board and the Four Seasons Garden Club, the cere-mony commemorated Gainesville’s 29th year as a “Tree City USA.”Although Arbor Day is cele-
brated in April nationwide, Florida residents celebrate early because of favorable weather conditions, said Mark Siburt, a Gainesville arborist.
Fifty-seven trees were planted 
Tuesday at Northside Park, with the final tree, a winged elm, planted at the center during Thursday’s cer -
emony.
Each pair of trees planted repre-
sented each year the city had been a tree-friendly community.
Siburt said it’s important for 
Gainesville to protect its trees.
“Trees are being removed,” he 
said. “It’s important to replenish the canopy that is lost.”

� MEN STOLE PIZZA, A PIZZA BAG AND $20 CASH.

Gainesville Police is looking for two men accused of 
robbing a Domino’s Pizza delivery driver Wednesday 
night.
Police have identified one suspect to be 28-year-old 
Jason L. Lynady, but as of Thursday night, investigators were still looking for both men, said GPD spokesman Ben Tobias.
The incident occurred at about 11 p.m. Wednesday 
when James Phillips was delivering a pizza to the Palms at Brook Valley apartment complex, located on the 1100 block of Northwest 39th Avenue.
While Phillips, 28, made his delivery, Lynady and 
another man walked up to him and allegedly stole his pizza, a pizza bag and $20 in cash, police said.
GPD officers and police dogs later arrived at the 
complex to look for Lynady and the other man but could not find them, Tobias said.
However, a GPD officer received a tip that Lynady 
earlier bragged to his friends about his plan for a pizza delivery robbery, Tobias said. Through the tip, police later found Lynady’s photograph.
During an interview, detectives presented the picture 
to Phillips, who identified Lynady as one of the men who robbed him, Tobias said. 
Investigators are still trying to identify the second 
suspect.

The cat’s out of the bag.
The American Veterinary Medical Associ-
ation ranked Florida No. 45 for cat ownership this week, with about 27 percent of house-holds in the state reported to own a cat.
“I feel like it would be a lot larger,” said 
Jessica Charlton, a program coordinator at Operation Catnip, an Alachua County orga-nization that spays and neuters feral cats.
Charlton said regardless of how many 
cats have owners in the Gainesville area, about 80,000 still live without a home. 
She said these numbers are calculated in 
comparison to the human population in the area.
Patti Gordon, a veterinarian at All Cats 
HealthCare Clinic, said she was shocked at the statistic.
“I’m surprised it’s so low,” she said. “I think the Gainesville area has a fairly large cat ownership, and I think we probably wouldn’t fit into those guidelines.”
Courtney Ellis, a 23-year-old health edu-
cation and behavior senior, has cared for her 4-year-old tortoiseshell cat, Nola, for the last three years.
Ellis said she didn’t like the fact that Flor -
ida ranked low on the study.
“I think there’s a negative stigma toward 
cats,” she said. “Cats are so calm. When they want love, they come to you.”
The top states for cat ownership included 
Vermont, where 49.5 percent of households 
had a cat, and Maine, where 46.4 percent of 
households own a cat.

Gillian Lord, chair of the Spanish 
and Portuguese Studies department, 
told Rosetta Stone she was trained to hate the company because it was try-ing to put her out of a job. Her newest study is about to put that idea to the test.
This semester, 21 students taking 
Beginning Spanish 1 at UF are volun-tarily taking the course using Rosetta Stone, the language learning comput-er software, instead of going to class.“Anybody who finds out that 
I teach Spanish — one of the first things people say after asking me to say something in Spanish is, ‘Does Rosetta Stone really work?’“ Lord said.
Lord received a $12,000 grant 
from UF’s Humanities Scholarship Enhancement Fund to compare the proficiency of three test groups. The test groups include students using only the software, students going to class using Rosetta Stone as a text-book supplement and students in a traditional class using the assigned textbook.
“We’re not trying to eliminate be-
ginning Spanish,” Lord said. “It’s not 
going anywhere. We’re just looking at what works and what doesn’t.”
Students in 
the class-exempt section will be re-
quired to attend four meetings to assess their prog-
ress. Students in all sections will take a proficiency test at the end of the se-mester, she said.
“My hunch is that there are things 
that [the Rosetta Stone students] will be able to accomplish very well, but when it comes to interpersonal in-teraction, they might not advance as well as the others,” she said.
Carlos Enrique Ibarra is the teach-
ing assistant assigned to teach both the hybrid class using Rosetta Stone as the textbook supplement and the traditional class.
“Technology can be used in very 
effective ways,” he said. “If you com-pare how much both groups have learned so far, even though the [Ro-setta Stone textbook class] seem to be at more ease speaking, they have learned much less. [The regular text-book students] are a little more scared. They feel a little more pressure, but they have learned a lot more.”
John Robinson, a second-year law 
student who is in the class-exempt section, said he feels accountable when sitting in class with a teacher and peers.
“Rosetta Stone is just a computer, 
so you don’t feel that bad if you get it wrong,” he said.

World-renowned peace activist the Rev. Joan Brown Camp-
bell will talk about religious tolerance and her life as an activist 
tonight at Santa Fe College.
The lecture, sponsored by SFC’s Humanities and Foreign 
Languages Department, is free and open to the public. The event starts at 7:30 p.m. and will be held at SFC’s Fine Arts Hall, 3000 
NW 83rd St. Parking at the college will also be free.
Bill Little, department chair of the Humanities and Foreign 
Languages Department, said about 300 people are expected to 
attend the event.“We are all truly honored to have this international speaker at 
our college,” he said. “This is a major event for our campus.”
Campbell’s accomplishments include having held local and 
national office positions such as being the first ordained woman to become a general secretary for the National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA. She also holds 11 honorary doc-torate degrees. Campbell is the director of the Department of Re-ligion at the Chautauqua Institute in New York.
SFC President Dr. Jackson Sasser said he looks forward to 
having Campbell talk about her message of religious tolerance.
“To understand humanity is to understand and respect the 
great religions of the world, and to have someone as distin-guished as Joan Campbell to provide a better understanding of the central core of religion, which is compassion, is a positive ex-perience,” he said.
Campbell will also talk about her “Charter for Compassion,” a document she co-authored promoting the restoration of  com-passion in the world, as well as tolerating differences in religion and ideology.
Sasser said he agreed with the document’s purpose.“That’s what a public institution should be doing — promot-
ing understanding and tolerance in all religions,” he said. “Im-portant parts of the community , such as colleges, should not be promoting one religion over another, or any religion, for that matter.”
So far, about 90,000 people have signed Campbell’s document 
online. When Campbell concludes her lecture tonight, Sasser, representing the SFC community , will sign the document on stage.
“When that charter is signed on behalf of SF College,” Little 
said, “it will be with the intention of affirming the values that we already promote here in our community.”Peace activist to speak at Santa Fe about religious tolerance

Living with a hearing disability and work-
ing as a firefighter paramedic, Jennifer Tozzo 
knows the importance of communication in an emergency.
With her lab shepherd service dog, Zoe, by 
her side, Tozzo was among about 25 people who attended the Alachua County Emergen-cy Operations Center’s awareness workshop Thursday for emergency responders and the Deaf community.
Tozzo, a disability training specialist and 
a member of the Citizens Disability Advisory Committee, said she was pleased with the expansion of Alachua County’s awareness of emergency response for the Deaf.
“It saves lives,” she said. “People with cer -
tain challenges are left out of the loop.”
David Donnelly , emergency management 
director for Alachua County Fire Rescue Ser -
vices, organized the workshop to break the communication barrier between first respond-ers and people with hearing loss.
“It’s really become a topic of interest in the 
emergency management field,” he said.
Donnelly said communication is tough for 
not only the Deaf and hard of hearing but also for the general public.
“We’re kind of frustrated because we can’t physically communicate,” he said, “and they’re frustrated because we’re not commu-nicating in a way that they can get the mes-sage.”Illinois State Police Master Sgt. John Gar -
ner, who has first-responder background, and Glenna Cooper, a sign language specialist, led the workshop, mediating conversation about preparedness between emergency officials and Deaf participants.
The eight-hour training workshop focused 
on safety, evacuation, transportation and medical needs.
Jeannene Mironack, assistant supervisor of 
elections for Alachua County, said respond-ers watched videos of people with using sign language. She said the purpose was to give emergency officials an insight into the lives of the Deaf.
“We’re learning their needs and what we 
have to present in our needs,” she said.
Frankie Beville, an emergency service of-
ficer volunteer chair for the American Red Cross, said the workshop helped him under -
stand how other organizations provide assis-tance to the disabled.
“It’s been very informative,” he said. “I’m 
anxious to get back and talk to our people about the situation and the resources avail-able to us.”
This is the first time Alachua County of-
fered the workshop. Donnelly said he hopes to make it an annual program and offer re-sponse methods to people with blindness in the future.
“Our job is to educate the public on the 
mechanisms we have,” he said. “The whole point is to ... make sure we are able to serve our whole community.”12, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, JANUARY 18, 2013

Sean Stewart-Muniz, an 18-year-old 
journalism freshman, studies for his 
exams in silence.
“I like to study by myself because I 
find people can be really distracting,” Muniz said. “Normally , I just sit with the book for a while and just read it straight through, no highlighting or anything.”
A study on Improving Students’ 
Learning With Effective Learning Techniques found practice testing and distributed practice were among methods that got higher results compared to highlighting, summarization and rereading.
The study , published in a journal 
of the Association for Psychological Science, found highlighting and rereading were among techniques that students depend highly on but were among the study habits that received a low utility assessment.

“Highlighting helps me because it reminds me to look back at certain things, but I’d rather make note cards for classes that cover a lot of information,” she said.
Although many students seem to use 
other study methods such as keyword mnemonics and imagery use for text learning, the study questions whether such methods are improving grades.
UF education professor Eileen 
Oliver said people learn differently, and highlighting and then rereading can be useful.
“I’ve had students who tell me they 
buy books that are highlighted, but how do we know if they’re going back and reading the rest of it?” Oliver said.
She said the type of studying depends 
on the subject.
“If the student is studying something 
that is required, but he or she doesn’t care at all about it, it’s a very different kind of studying than if it’s something you’re passionate about,” Oliver said.Highlighters aren’t cutting it
� THE CENTER WILL ALSO REACH OUT 
TO THE PUBLIC, POLICE AND MILITARY.

The UF College of Education, Levin College 
of Law and Center for Latin American Stud-
ies will join together with two Colombian law schools to create a human rights center in the Caribbean region of Colombia.
A grant of about $757,000 from the national 
Higher Education for Development office will help fund the three-year effort.
The purpose of the center is to build human 
rights capacity at law schools in this area, said Philip Williams, director of the Center for Latin American Studies and one of the project’s di-rectors.
The Universidad del Magdalena in Santa 
Marta and the Universidad del Norte in Bar -
ranquilla will administer the human rights cen-ter, according to a press release.
The center will allow Colombian law stu-
dents to attain experience in practicing human rights law by working with victims of human rights violations, Williams said. The center will also provide outreach educational programs for the general public, police and military.“After years of internal conflict, enhancing 
the protection of human rights for ordinary Colombians is critical to the country’s future democratic development,” he said.
Along with Williams, who will be focusing 
on administering the grant and bringing UF’s law faculty to develop a curriculum in Colom-bia, the team of project directors include Jon 
Mills and Pilar Mendoza.
The Center for Govern-
mental Responsibility’s An-nual Conference on Legal & Policy Issues in the Americas will have a focus on human rights in Colombia. There will be a workshop in Gainesville this spring, followed by a 
conference held in Colombia 
in spring 2014, according to the Center for Latin American Studies’ website.
Mendoza, an assistant professor in higher 
education administration in the College of Education, will assess and evaluate the project development and be a cultural liaison, given her Colombian background. To Mendoza, the partnership is a way to go back to her roots.
“People leave underdeveloped countries 
and turn their back to them,” she said. “For me, this is a way to come back, not necessarily mov-ing back, but to leverage resources.”UF partners with Colombian 
schools for human rights center

While customers indulge in ice 
cream Monday at Sweet Dreams, 
Miracle Children will be creating art inspired by the frozen treat.
Dance Marathon at UF will be holding a fundraiser at the store’s new location, 1040 E. University Ave., from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. to raise money for the annual 26.2-hour event that benefits patients at Shands Hospital for Children.
Nicole Martinez, the event’s pub-
lic relations overall chair, said Mira-cle Children are ambassadors “who have decided to share their stories with DM at UF and have been treat-ed at [the hospital].”
Martinez, a 20-year-old advertis-
ing junior, said Michaels donated canvases for children to paint on with brushes and other supplies provided by Shands Arts in Medi-cine. The artwork will be auctioned off.
“Customers can come in and bid 
on the artwork on the walls,” Mar -
tinez said.
Bryn Reide, the hospitality over -
all chair, said bidding starts at $15.Twenty percent of proceeds from the ice cream sales will go toward this year’s Dance Marathon, Marti-nez said, and 100 percent of the pro-ceeds from the artwork will also go to DM at UF.
Last year, Reide, a 22-year-old 
political science senior, attended a similar event and ended up playing with the family’s Miracle Child for two hours.
“I went to just get ice cream, but 
it reminded me why I’m doing DM,” she said.
Dance Marathon hosts ice cream event to raise money, spirits“Highlighting helps me 
because it reminds me to look 
back at certain thing.”

Former Florida defensive coordinator 
Dan Quinn accepted the same position 
with the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday afternoon. Gators special teams coordina-tor and linebackers coach D.J. Durkin was promoted to replace Quinn.
“I’m happy for Dan and this oppor -
tunity ,” coach Will Muschamp said in a statement. “I’ve said before that I always encourage my staff when opportunities arise to take the next step in their career. Dan’s background is in the NFL and this is a great chance to go back to a place he’s familiar with.”
Quinn previously served as the Sea-
hawks defensive line coach for two years before coming to Florida. He rejoins Pete Carroll in Seattle after spending the past two seasons in Gainesville. Quinn fills the void left by former Seahawks defensive coordinator Gus Bradley , who was hired as the head coach of the Jacksonville Jag-uars on Wednesday.
The Gators ranked ninth in the nation 
in total defense in 2010 prior to Quinn’s arrival, allowing 306.5 yards per game. The following season, the unit surren-dered just 299.5 yards per game, which was good for eighth in the country.
In 2012, the defense showed significant 
improvement, finishing fifth in the FBS with just 286.7 yards allowed per game and second in pass efficiency defense.
Durkin, who has served as Florida’s 
special teams coordinator and lineback-ers coach for the past three seasons, will continue to coach the linebackers in his new position.
“D.J. and I will run the defense, con-
tinuing the way that Dan and I did for the past two years,” Muschamp said in the press release. “We will look to add an-other coach that is the best fit for our staff moving forward.”
The Gators are losing seven defensive 
starters from their 2012 team: defensive tackles Sharrif Floyd and Omar Hunter, safeties Matt Elam and Josh Evans and linebackers Jon Bostic, Jelani Jenkins and Lerentee McCray.
However, Durkin will have five re-
turning starters and other underclassmen who saw significant playing time last sea-son to work with including cornerbacks Loucheiz Purifoy and Marcus Roberson, defensive linemen Dominique Easley, Jonathan Bullard and Dante Fowler, and linebackers Antonio Morrison, Michael Taylor and Neiron Ball.

January Miller emerged as a legitimate scor -
ing option for the Gators two weeks ago.
Facing No. 6 Kentucky on the road, Miller 
scored a career-high 17 points on an efficient 
5-of-7 shooting performance.
Ten days later, she scored in double figures 
again, dropping 11 points against No. 9 Tennes-see. 
Florida lost each game, but coach Amanda 
Butler found another go-to scorer, something she expected Miller to become this season. 
“She’s here because she is a scorer,” Butler 
said.
“January, if you just start tracking people 
from the beginning of the season to where we are right now, is, hands down, our most im-proved player.” 
Butler hopes Miller’s improvement contin-
ues when Florida faces South Carolina in the O’Connell Center on Sunday at 1 p.m. 
The Gators lost two matchups to the Game-
cocks last season, scoring a season-low 44 points in a home loss on Jan. 8. 
Entering Thursday, South Carolina again 
boasts one of the nation’s top defensive units. 
The Gamecocks are tied for 11th in the nation 
allowing just 0.72 points per possession.
South Carolina ranks second only to Ken-
tucky in the Southeastern Conference with that mark.
Coach Dawn Staley’s team is third in the 
country in scoring defense, limiting opponents to 47.1 points per contest. 
“They are one of the best defensive teams not 
just in our conference but in the country,” Butler said. 
Florida is preparing for another physical, 
low-scoring affair.
Miller’s offensive production will be critical 
off the bench.  
Early in the season, Miller struggled to fill 
the role coaches expected of her. She averaged just 3.2 points per game in Florida’s first 12 con-tests. Freshman guard

UF pressured Texas A&M defensively on Thursday night, 
and the Aggies folded. 
No. 10 Florida (13-2, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) used a 
22-2 run to seal a 68-47 victory against Texas A&M in Reed 
Arena in College Station, Texas.
“We just knew on the road it’s really tough to come in here 
and get a win,” junior Patric Young said. “We knew we had to be focused on our concepts of moving the ball around and re-ally locking down on Elston Turner, and we really did a good job of that.”  
Turner, the Aggies’ leading scorer with 17.1 points per game before Thursday, scored only 4 points on 1-of-10 shoot-ing. In the senior guard’s last contest — an 83-71 upset against Kentucky on Saturday — he scored 40 points and made 14 of 19 field goal attempts. 
“Give Scottie Wilbekin 
a lot of credit,” coach Billy Donovan said. “He did a heck of a job on Elston 
Turner and made it very, very difficult on him.”
UF contained Texas A&M (12-4, 2-1 SEC) to 34 percent 
shooting. Before Thursday’s game, the Aggies shot 45.8 per -
cent. 
“I thought in the first half our defensive coverage not only Florida routs Texas A&M in road win“Coming from high school to college, 
it’s obviously a big change. We’ve all 
gotten more confident. We’ve played in 
tough games and made monumental 
changes to get better as a unit.”

Alligator Staff Writer
Junior Eddie Lovett was focus-
ing on three things while setting 
up in the blocks for the finals of the men’s 55-meter hurdles.
Head down, back parallel to the 
ground and looking at his feet.
After finishing first during the 
preliminary heat with a time of 7.17 at Thursday’s Gator Invita-tional, hurdles coach Erin Tuck-er discussed his concerns with Lovett’s start. 
“He told me that my start 
wasn’t as good, … and I picked my head up too soon,” Lovett said. “My advantage — what re-ally gets the job done — is my start and me in between (hurdles), so I just really focused on that for the finals.”
Lovett’s focus worked. In the finals, Lovett finished 
with a time of 7.10 to break a 23-year-old Florida record, which Earl Diamond set in 1990 with a time of 7.15. Lovett also claimed his second straight individual title this season.
“Eddie Lovett, what can you 
say,” coach Mike Holloway said. “He had a phenomenal perfor-mance — a new school record. … Couldn’t ask more from him to-day.”
Last year Lovett suffered a 
tear to his oblique that sidelined him for a majority of the indoor season. He also battled problems in his psoas muscle during the indoor season, which affected his posture during races. 
Still, Lovett said that he’s much 
healthier and is confident in his last two performances as the Gators head into their most chal-lenging meet yet — the Razorback Invitational in Fayetteville, Ark.  
“These two meets were a good 
practice,” Lovett said. “Now it’s just basically getting it going like a steamroller. As you go, it gets better, and I’ll be full speed by the time we get to [the Southeastern Conference Indoor Champion-ships].”
Along with Lovett’s victory, 
Florida had 11 wins at the Gator Invitational including 21 top-three finishes.
“I’ll be honest with you, I think 
we’ve got some work to do on the sprinters,” Holloway said. 
“Overall, we’re in a good spot; 
I really liked what I saw. I just like this team as a whole. There’s good people, they’re hardworking and they really want to get better.”

tin@alligator.org.
Junior hurdler breaks 23-year-old 
school record at Gator Invitationalon [Turner] but their team was very 
good,” Donovan said. “We had a couple breakdowns here and there, but on the road, to come in like that was really im-pressive by our guys.”
Young scored 18 points on 7-of-9 
shooting. The junior center also tallied three steals and pulled down seven re-bounds. 
After missing Saturday’s 74-52 road 
win against LSU in Baton Rouge, La., with a left ankle sprain, Mike Rosario scored a team-high 19 points on 7-of-15 shooting. The redshirt senior guard scored 11 of Florida’s first 13 points in the contest’s opening 7 minutes.  
Senior forward Erik Murphy record-
ed 16 points and grabbed seven boards. 
The Gators led by only one point with 
7:23 remaining in the first half but held the Aggies to 1-of-16 shooting until the 16:16 mark in the second period. 
“I thought we got a little lucky in the 
first half because we gave them a couple offensive rebounds that they didn’t score on,” Donovan said. “Then we had a cou-ple bad possessions on offense. Then we finally got a couple quick points ... Then (Kenny) Boynton hit a three,  Murphy hit a three, Patric got a couple three-point plays, and we opened up a pretty good lead.”
Although the Aggies outrebounded 
the Gators 33-28, UF won the turnover battle 16-11. 
With junior forward Casey Prather 
sidelined due to a high left ankle sprain, Donovan used a rotation of seven play-ers. Four played through injuries.   
After Thursday’s game, Donovan has 
a chance to earn win No. 400 as Florida’s head coach on Saturday against No. 17 Missouri (13-3, 2-1 SEC) at home. 
“The key word for this year with 
[Donovan] has been resilience and per -
sistence through the adversity, through the injuries, the concussions, the sprained ankles,” Young said. “We didn’t hang our heads, and we’ve had great results.”
Young said the quick turnaround 
won’t be an issue for the banged-up Gators on Saturday.  
“We trust our trainers in [Dave] Wer -
ner and Preston Greene that they are going to make sure we get ready for the game,” Young said. “(We’re) not worried about our legs.”
A radio broadcast contributed to this 
report.
But Miller has since be-
come more effective. In 
four SEC games, she is av-eraging 8.5 points, which ranks fourth on the team and is tops among Florida’s freshmen. 
“She’s come a long, long way,” Butler said.
“There’s no question 
she’s our most improved player.”
For Miller, the increased 
production stems from a self-assuredness that has developed throughout the season. 
“I’m getting more com-
fortable,” Miller said. 
“Coming from high school to college, it’s obvi-ously a big change. We’ve all gotten more confident. We’ve played in tough games and made monu-mental changes to get bet-ter as a unit.”
The epitome of Miller’s 
development came late in regulation against Tennes-see on Sunday. 
The Volunteers led 69-68 
with 37 seconds remaining in the second half.
Butler called a timeout 
following a missed jumper by Tennessee’s Isabelle Harrison and diagrammed a play the Gators work on tirelessly in practice. 
The play called for Mill-
er to use a screen to take a shot from the elbow, an area Butler coined “the money box.” 
Miller did such, receiv-
ing the ball and sinking the shot to give the Gators a 70-69 advantage with 29 seconds remaining. 
Tennessee’s Bashaara 
Graves was fouled 16 sec-onds later.
She made one free throw 
to tie the game, stripping Miller of her potential game-winning shot. Coaches and teammates were impressed with the freshman’s poise.
“January has definitely 
come into her own,” ju-nior Vicky McIntyre said. “We’re just going to keep going to her as long as she’s hot. She’s really stepping up as a role player.”

Two weeks ago, Bryan Shelton 
received a surprising phone call. 
On the other end of the line, the 
first-year UF men’s tennis coach 
heard Spencer Newman’s voice.
Newman decided to return to 
Florida and play for the Gators after spending a semester at Michigan.
Newman was 43-17 in singles 
during his first two years at Florida and led the Gators with 32 victories during the 2011 campaign.
Former UF coach Andy Jackson announced his resignation on May 25, opening the door for Florida to hire Shelton on June 8 as the 10th coach in school history.
Shelton tried to change New-
man’s mind, but the junior trans-ferred to Michigan on June 22, 2012.
“My first goal was to try and get 
him to stay ,” Shelton said. “I wasn’t successful, unfortunately , because we would’ve loved to have him back in the fall. Since then, he has decided this is the place he needs to be. It’s kind of like the prodigal son who has returned, because every-body here has opened up their arms and (are) just so happy that this guy is back.”
Newman will be ineligible this 
spring due to transfer rules. 
But that hasn’t stopped New-man from help-ing No. 12 Flor -
ida in practice where Shelton said the junior has “worked his 
tail off.”
The Miami native played on the 
Nos. 3-5 single courts last season. His timely fist bumps and long ral-lies were a crowd favorite.
“When we heard, we were all 
really excited,” junior Michael Al-ford said. “It feels like he was gone a while, but it was only a semester. It is good to have him back. He’s en-thusiastic and a really good player.”
Alford is one of six upperclass-
men on the Florida roster this sea-son. Seniors Bob van Overbeek and Billy Federhofer return.
The injury-prone van Overbeek 
is healthy heading into the spring season, Shelton said.
Juniors Florent Diep and Steph-ane Piro round out the upperclass-men. Piro, from Marseille, France, makes his spring debut on Saturday against No. 65 Miami on Saturday at noon at Linder Stadium.
Shelton will determine the line-
ups within 12 hours to match time. While as many as eight players could see time on the court, there will be one familiar face watching from the crowd — Spencer Newman.
“He has infused some energy 
into our program from the very first day he arrived,” Shelton said.

Kytra Hunter had just closed out Flori-
da’s final rotation on floor with a 9.925.
Her double layout, one-and-a-half twist 
was enough to give the Gators a 0.25 edge 
against Alabama in the 2012 NCAA Cham-pionship just before the Crimson Tide head-ed into its final exercise.
Ashley Priess’ near-perfect 9.95 balance 
beam routine gave Alabama a 49.5 on its last event to edge Florida 197.85-197.775, dashing any hope of UF claiming a national championship.“That second place finish at nationals 
wasn’t a good feeling,” Hunter said. “I hate losing more than I love winning.”
The fresh wound has only driven Hunter 
— and her teammates — to achieve more. 
Hours spent training during the Summer 
A semester with All-American teammate Ashanee Dickerson has aided in Hunter’s execution in two performances this season.
“I trained with her in the summer, and 
she worked then exactly how she works now,” Dickerson said. “She’s amazing, and it doesn’t look like she’s missed a beat.”
Less than a year removed from the Gators’ 
second-place finish behind the Crimson Tide, Hunter continues to make her claim as the nation’s top collegiate female gymnast. 
Competing as Florida’s first-ever NCAA 
all-around title winner, Hunter started the 2013 season with two event titles — uneven bars and floor — on Jan. 4 against Ball State. 
But Hunter shined brightest last Friday 
against LSU in Baton Rouge, La., where 
the  defend-ing NCAA all-around and vault champion won 
the event title at 39.675, marking her seventh career all-around win. 
Scores of 9.95 and 9.9 on vault and un-
even bars, respectively, secured two more event titles for Hunter, giving the sopho-more standout 26 event titles in total. 
Coach Rhonda Faehn was convinced 
Hunter’s vault exercise could have earned a score of 10. 
“That’s what makes her really so incred-
ible is that she is able to pick up so quickly from last season,” Faehn said.
Hunter will aim to reach new heights in 
tonight’s home meet against Missouri at 7 p.m. in the O’Connell Center.
“I just want the team to follow after my 
role because I do feel I work hard and give it all that I can — and so do the other girls — but sometimes you need a little extra push, and I think that’s what I can be,” Hunter said.
