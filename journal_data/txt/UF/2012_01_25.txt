The biannual ﬂ  ocking 
of business suits and pen-
cil skirts to the  Spring Ca-reer Showcase on Tuesday was larger than usual, but it wasn’t job-seeking UF stu-dents and alumni who made the difference.
The showcase featured a 
15 percent increase in em-ployer participation from last spring, according to a Career Resource Center ofﬁ  cial.
UF students and alumni 
spoke to representatives from 226 companies at the O’Connell Center on Tuesday for the ﬁ  rst half of the two-day Spring Career Showcase, said Elaine Dorsey, assistant director of employee relations at the CRC.
The CRC hosts a showcase 
each semester to bring poten-tial employers to the school. Students in non-scientiﬁ  c ma-jors attend the ﬁ  rst day of the showcase, and students with science-related majors attend the second day.
More than 6,000 students 
and alumni attended both days of the fall showcase, said CRC Director Heather White. She expects the same number this year.
Dorsey said she believes 
the increased involvement may be the byproduct of com-panies failing to meet their hiring quotas for 2012. 
“We had a lot of people 
who registered toward the end of the showcase dead-line,” she said. “It appears they have a strong forecast with their hiring plans.”
George Rogers, a Farmers 
Insurance representative who attended the showcase, con-ﬁ  rmed this trend.

Following recent attacks in the So-
rority Row area, University Police add-
ed new stops to the Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol route. 
The changes to SNAP , which went 
into effect at the beginning of spring semester, were made in response to a Q&A session between UPD and Pan-hellenic Council members in Decem-ber. Sorority women said they were concerned there weren’t enough SNAP stops on Sorority Row and no stops for off-campus sorority houses, said UPD Sgt. Kristy Maculan. 
SNAP stops were added in front of every sorority house, including the three off-campus houses.  Stops were also added at Oakbrook Walk and The Continuum because they are consid-ered student housing. However, Oak-brook Walk’s SNAP stop is temporary, Maculan said. 
“The intent and hope with these 
changes is that sorority house residents will feel safer,” she said. 
Business sophomore Nicole Ronzon, 
19, lives on Sorority Row. 
After the attacks, she said she doesn’t 
feel safe running after dark.
“I feel as though these new stops 
should have been a part of SNAP’s route even before the recent attacks oc-curred,” she said.SNAP adds more stops to

Some students have trouble keeping 
their New Year’s ﬁ  tness resolutions. Others, 
however, are running into difﬁ  culties before they even reach the treadmills.
Issues arose between the computer sys-
tems for RecSports and the registrar’s ofﬁ  ce, which caused about 200 students to be incor-rectly listed as ineligible for membership.
Pamela Hightower, coordinator for tech-
nology, assessment and membership ser-vices for UF RecSports, said data from the registrar’s ofﬁ  ce determines gym member-ship eligibility. 
She said students might have had trouble 
if they were not registered as full-time stu-dents or had not paid tuition, among other reasons. 
When 20-year-old pre-nursing sopho-
more Barbara Cadet scanned her hand at the Student Recreation Center, a ﬂ  ashing screen directed her to the registration desk.
“When I went to the desk, they asked me 
if I was taking any classes, and I told them I was a full-time student,” Cadet said. Gym employees let her in, she said, but they told 
her to visit Southwest Rec’s ofﬁ  ces. 
An employee told 
her the computer system may not have processed her drop/add schedule changes, instead listing her as a part-time student.
Hightower said RecS-
ports has ﬁ  xed member-
ship problems for 210 students so far. 
Associate University Registrar Mary Ann 
Hagler said the ofﬁ  ce did not have a history of  difﬁ  culties. She said she was unaware of the issues.About 200 turned away at

UF students can get technical and technological 
with their opinions at the launch of the Bob Graham 
Center for Public Service’s Civil Debate Wall tonight.
The Wall Launch Party will be at Pugh Hall from 5 
p.m. to 7 p.m. All students are invited.
Five 46-by-26-inch touch-screen panels comprise 
the Civil Debate Wall, which displays a question each week about public policy.
This week’s question is “Should children of un-
documented immigrants be able to attend public schools?”
Students visiting the wall can answer with “yes” 
or “no,” and then defend their opinions in a 140-char -acter statement.
Participants can debate with others and track re-
sponses to their posts via email or text message. The center’s policy council partnered with AdWerks, UF Ad Society’s student-run advertising agency, to make the launch party specifically geared toward students, said Shelby Taylor, a spokeswoman for the center.
Civildebatewall.com shows about 300 registered 
users, Taylor said. About 180 students responded to last week’s question.
“We wanted to see if there was a way in which we 
could leverage digital technology with social media to get students talking about something more than sim-ply just a status update,” Taylor said. WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 25, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 3

Three Gators-themed buses hit the streets Monday.
UF partnered with Gainesville’s Regional Transit Sys-
tem to bring the buses to Gainesville, said Chip Skinner, spokesman for RTS. The buses arrived in Gainesville from California in December but could not run until license plate tags were available. 
The buses are fitted with a vinyl Gators-print wrap and the slogan “The Gator Nation is Every-where.”
They took about a year to make, he 
said.
Skinner said campus development 
funds, which are provided by the Florida 
legislature and allow state-run universi-ties to develop transportation and other infrastructure. Skinner estimates that 
each bus cost UF $415,000. The three buses are currently running on routes 43, 35 
and 28.
Skinner said the spirited buses were proposed and de-
signed to highlight RTS’s partnership with UF. Revenue from UF and Santa Fe College will account for more than half of the RTS operating budget in the 2012-13 fiscal year, according to a news release.
“We worked in conjunction with UF to get the design 
approved and then get them on the buses once they were,” Skinner said. “Since we do get a lot of advertising and bus wraps out on the road, we start thinking of ways that we can make the buses stand out more to the public.”Gators-themed buses started running on campus Monday

Gainesville Mayor Craig Lowe speaks at the State of the City address on Tuesday afternoon at the Hippodrome 
State Theatre.
BENJAMIN S. BRASCH
Alligator Writer
In the annual State of the City address, Mayor Craig Lowe 
discussed ways to increase Gainesville’s job base and strength-
en the downtown area to bolster the city’s quality of life.
Lowe spoke to a crowd of about 70 people about what the 
city has done in the past year and his plans for the upcoming year.
A high quality of living and a diverse population are 
Gainesville’s greatest advantages, Lowe said.
“A dedication to progress defines our city,” he said.The city plans to keep developing Downtown, he said.“The state of Gainesville’s economy is strong and grow-
ing,” Lowe said. “I believe Gainesville already has the tools for economic growth.”
In 2012, Gainesville will see the holistic view of Innovation 
Square come to life, he said.
“We are continuing to see a renaissance in the heart of our 
city,” Lowe said.
A new, innovative bus system that is in the works is an 
integral part of the transportation changes happening in the city, Lowe said.
Earlier this year, Gainesville was named the city with the 
shortest commute time in Florida and 19th best commute time in the country, Lowe said, citing data analyzed by the Orlando Business Journal and collected by the U.S. Census Bureau.
On Oct. 18, the U.S. Department of Transportation granted 
Gainesville’s Regional Transit System $9 million, he said.
Increased transportation will help people experience the 
culture of downtown Gainesville, Lowe said.
“We must do our best to maintain our identity and keep 
our commitment,” he said.Gainesville Mayor talks jobs, quality of life in State of the City address  locAl

A UF woman could be the next face of 
Cheerwine.
The second annual Miss Cheerwine con-
test is open to Florida women ages 21 to 25. 
This is the first year Florida residents can en-ter the contest, because Cheerwine expand-ed distribution into Florida in October.
“It’s a great opportunity for young wom-
en to have the experience of a lifetime by exploring the South and connecting with a variety of Cheerwine fans,” said Shani Mal-loy, a 25-year-old senior account coordina-tor of The Thomas Collective firm, which represents Cheerwine. The winner of this year’s Miss Cheer -
wine contest will also promote Cheerwine throughout the U.S. Malloy said the com-pany’s goal is to make the brand available in all 50 states by the company’s 100th an-niversary in 2017.
Participants living in Florida, Georgia, 
Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia are eligible to apply for the contest through Cheerwine’s Face-book page until March 5. The contest started Jan. 17.
Due to the popularity of last year’s Miss 
Cheerwine contest, Cheerwine will let fans decide the winner, Malloy said.
Fans will vote on three finalists chosen 
by the company starting April 2. A winner will be announced through Cheerwine’s Fa-cebook page around April 28, Malloy said. 
Cheerwine was created in 1917 by gen-
eral store owner L. D. Peeler in Salisbury, N.C. 
The drink was introduced to Florida for 
the first time in October. 
Victoria Colson, a 21-year-old public re-
lations junior, said she is a fan of Cheerwine, but she does not plan to participate in the contest. “I think it’s a good idea,” she said. “I 
don’t think I would [participate] because I have a bunch of internships going on.”
Julie Rothe, an 18-year-old information 
systems freshman, said she has liked Cheer -
wine for about two months. 
“It’s a pretty tasty drink,” she said. “It’s 
cherry-flavored, but it doesn’t taste like medicine. Plus, I like being able to drink out of the glass bottle.”
Aside from not being a Florida resident 
or of age, Rothe said she would be interest-ed in participating in the contest. 
“That would be awesome to travel 
around the South and meet new people,” she said. “Being called ‘Miss Cheerwine’ would be amazing.”

UF freshmansince we were here in the fall,” Rogers 
said. “There has been a consistent in-crease in the number of hires since the ﬁ  rst quarter of last year.” 
The expanded participation has led 
to other job and internship opportunities for students and alumni. 
Shipping company R+L Carriers, in 
its ﬁ  rst appearance at the showcase, an-nounced plans to develop an information technology center on University Avenue. The center will bring about 20 full-time jobs and internships, according to R+L Carriers representative Brice Carpenter.
Paul Polito, a 21–year-old ﬁ  nance ju-
nior, said he felt more conﬁ  dent about receiving a call back from a potential employer than he did at the last spring showcase.
“There were a lot more high-end em-
ployers as opposed to last year,” Poli-to said. “I would give my odds a fair chance.”SAMANTHA SHAVELL

Tuesday’s Student Senate meeting rec-
ognized the work of Glenda Frederick, the 
Senate Program Assistant who is retiring after about 20 years with Student Govern-ment. 
“It’s a sad day for us, but a happy day 
for Glenda,” said former Student Body President Ben Meyers.
The meeting room in the Reitz Union 
was ﬁ  lled with current senators and sever-al former SG Student Body presidents and Senate presidents there to say goodbye. 
“SG will suffer with [her] absence,” said 
former Student Senate President and 2001-2002 Student Body President Marc Adler. 
Audrey Goldman, former Senate presi-
dent in 2009, said she will always remember Frederick’s rule to “be nice to everyone.”  
Senate President Andrew Mason 
thanked Frederick for being a resource, a role model and a friend for more than 25 years. 
“I will think about you. I will miss you. 
I may even come back and visit you,” Fred-erick said.  “But I promise I will never for-get a minute of it.” 
During the meeting, the Senate also 
unanimously passed a clause that was mis-takenly taken out during the summer, said Sen. Christina Bonarrigo after the meeting. 
The clause states that during fall and 
summer terms, three unexcused or four combined unexcused and excused absences from the Senate will constitute resignation. The clause will be reinstated if it passes ﬁ  -nal approval at the next meeting.
An increase to the number of UF Su-preme Court justices was unanimously given ﬁ  nal approval.
This amendment increases the number 
of justices in the Supreme Court from four to six, excluding the Chief Justice. Now ﬁ  ve members are needed to make a decision, and four of the members need to agree in order to make a decision.  WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 25, 2012  ALLIGATOR, 5

41 TOTAL VOTESTuesday’s question: Is your rent going up next year? We Pick Paul
Editorial Board endorses 
Texas congressman
On Tuesday, Jan. 31, voters will flock to the polls to distribute Florida’s 50 delegates among the four con-tenders left in the Republican presidential primary. 
If you plan to vote in the primary, the Editorial Board of the Alligator encourages you to place your vote for Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas. 
Paul is an unconventional candidate who does not fit the 
standard Republican mold — and that’s why we like him. Unlike his 2008 bid for the White House, his campaign has been on the offensive. Rather than going after his competi-tors over non-issues like extramarital affairs, he has been at-tacking the other candidates for their inconsistency and lack of commitment to serious ideas. 
Paul puts winning the nomination second to the prolif-
eration of his ideas — ideas that would never even have been discussed by the media four years ago. Who would ever think that a top contender for the White House would be talking about ending the Federal Reserve or the war on drugs?
His ideas are why we believe he is an attractive candidate 
to college students of all political persuasions. Unlike the other Republican candidates, Paul believes in a non-inter -
ventionist foreign policy. It was surprising to see him booed the other night in the South Carolina debate when he said we should take a “Golden Rule” approach to our foreign affairs. 
It’s not anti-American, as other candidates have claimed, 
to evaluate our foreign policy and its influence on the way people behave in the Middle East. Looking at cause and ef-fect and critical thinking should be appreciated by anyone pursuing a college degree. 
Paul is the only candidate for president, including Presi-
dent Barack Obama, who has questioned the effectiveness of the war on drugs. While some have painted Paul as an advocate for drug use, his opposition comes from two main factors. First, he believes the government does not have the right to tell us what we can and cannot put into our own bodies. Second, he believes drug prohibition has perpetuat-ed the spread of drugs and the crime associated with it, simi-lar to the prohibition of the 1920s. It is not “soft on crime” to look at the causes of many criminal actions. 
Finally, for college students who have grown up in the 
post-9/11 era, Paul is the only candidate concerned about the growing infringement of our civil liberties. Even Presi-dent Obama recently signed the National Defense Authori-zation Act, a bill that could lead to the indefinite detention of U.S. citizens. He also signed an extension of the Patriot Act. 
You may not agree with Ron Paul on many issues, but for 
college-aged voters in the Florida Republican primary, Paul should be your choice.
Ignoring campus preachers will stop hate
As you emerge from a lecture in Turlington Hall, you are met by a religious fanatic spewing hate — a spectacle that is fundamentally opposite to the 
intellectualism and philosophy of academia. The crowd is budding and you’re left with two options: stop and gawk at a miserable person attempting to spread ignorance and intolerance, or continue walking. The former option is tempting in the same way visiting a circus might be; satis-fying a primal interest to view a spectacle. But every sec-ond you spend watching the pontificator is just another second encouraging his or her behavior.  
The past couple years have brought many breeds of 
religious fanatics to Gainesville, some flaunting “Islam is of the devil” shirts and others shrieking that you, a col-lege student trying to maneuver through crowds to your next class, will spend eternity in hell unless you accept the beliefs they were most likely born into. These people, collectively referred to as the “Turlington preachers,” are not a phenomenon exclusive to UF. Campus preachers are found ubiquitously at American universities. They sur -
vive on one thing: attention.
If you give campus preachers your attention, you ac-
knowledge that they use an effective means of commu -
nication. If you stop to listen, you acknowledge that it is worthwhile for them to bring misinformation and in-tolerance to our campus. In essence, listening to campus preachers encourages them to continue with their absurd behavior. But we do not want to encourage that absurd behavior in our society, much less in an educational insti-tution. 
For the benefit of yourself and our university, you 
should not engage in a one-liner, public debate with cam-pus preachers. You can’t win. 
They win the moment you stop, long before you open 
your mouth. You also certainly should not say a mean-spirited comment in passing. Why add more hate to their lives? The only reasonable course of action is to ignore them entirely. Ignoring campus preachers sends a message that prideful ignorance is not toler -
ated in an intellectual institution, and if they are perpetually ig-nored, they will eventually stop fear- and hate-mongering.
But the act of ignoring must be 
unremitting and almost forced. It is easy to stop and gawk at  yell-
ing ignoramuses, but the moment you stop and gawk, they have already achieved their goal. If the collective Student Body utterly ignores them, campus preachers will learn that hateful, over-the-top conduct is not an effective way to communicate, and they will be left with two options: change their behavior or fade into oblivion.
Being keen, educated Gainesville residents, we know 
the most important step toward wisdom is the perpetual consideration of ideas in conflict with your own. Clearly, I don’t advocate shunning a belief simply because it is ex-treme. We all have ideas that someone somewhere would consider extreme. Private discussion with campus preach-ers is fine, but the anti-intellectual disputes that occur on campus are not. Attempting to have an open-minded dis-cussion in private with campus preachers will probably be futile, but you might just learn something like what type of life can lead someone to such hatefulness or how you should not raise your kids.
But when they are on campus misinterpreting scientific 
theories or pontificating about ideas founded on ignorance and hate, you should not acknowledge campus preachers. If the Student Body can do this, we can take a little bit of hate out of our campus. So for the benefit of yourself and our university, the next time you see a campus preacher, just keep walking.

For those who have read or watched the “Lord of the 
Rings” trilogy, it can be easy to desire the sort of world J.R.R. Tolkien portrayed. The Shire, an idealistic agrarian 
community on the western edge of Middle Earth, appears to be a world of social and economic bliss. There, hobbits peace-fully engage in their day-to-day business: growing crops, sell-ing simple goods and ending a hard day’s work with a pint of ale at The Green Dragon. It is enough to make one nostalgic for a world that never truly existed, and it prompts the question: Is this sort of realm possible?
As it turns out, many economists and philosophers have 
asked the same question. As silly as it sounds, the model of the Shire has been a foundational building block for the niche eco-nomic theory of distributism. For those who are suspicious of both socialism and laissez-faire capitalism, distributism is often presented as a “third way .” The basic principle of distributism is simple: The means of production should be dispersed as widely as possible among individuals, rather than belonging to a government (as it is in communism or socialism) or by a few corporations (as in most capitalist systems). 
Thus farms, shops and the like are owned by families and 
groups of friends rather than by gargantuan entities. It certain-ly sounds like a paradigm with which Bilbo and Frodo would be familiar. For the cynics among us, this sounds like a dubious proposi-tion. This system may work well for an agrarian community, but cer -
tainly not on a wide scale. A small unit of localized compatriots surely could not construct an airplane fac-tory, build a skyscraper or manufac-ture iPhones as corporations can. 
However, if we truly are so enamored with living in a mech-
anized, centralized and mass-produced world, why do our hearts long for the Shire and its beautiful simplicity? That is the question modern distributists wish to arouse. Have we, like the dwarfs of Moria, dug too greedily and too deeply? On the sur -
face, the beloved “progress” of the modern age has provided us with great bounties. Massive corporations supply us with the cheap products we so desire, and a bloated government offers us unlimited safety (as long as it retains the ability to borrow money from future generations). 
However, more and more, we find ourselves separated from 
local communities. We live off food harvested around the globe and cling to shallow friendships across vast social networks. Would the hobbits of Middle Earth truly recognize this as “real life”? More to the point, would our ancestors? They lived in a world governed by daily interaction among a fellowship of crucial economic actors, every person an integral cog in the local economy . These relationships were far more meaningful than a collection of profiles on a Facebook page that serve only to inflate individual narcissism. 
Alas, we have long since passed the point where distribut-
ism could be viable economically . 
The modern age has seen to that. The political and economic 
paradigm has become one of capitalism versus socialism with no room for the poor hobbits in between. Yet, as Tolkien himself wrote, “Faithless is he that says farewell when the road dark-ens.” The basic tenants of distributism can still resound in all of us. Liberals of the green movement can fully embrace the principles of localism, and conservatives can sympathize with the traditional society such an economic system implies. 
The famous conservative thinker G.K. Chesterton, one of 
the founding fathers of distributism, loved to repeat the famous rallying cry, “three acres and a cow.” At the risk of sounding like a backwards traditionalist, if that was good enough for the hobbits of the Shire, it’s good enough for me.

Shire from Lord of the Rings an ideal economic modelColumn
Another semester has come, and with 
it, more tuition for students to stress over. According to the College Board, 
if a student enrolled in 2010, he or she can expect to pay $33,300 for a four-year public university — a 7.9 percent increase in the last decade. In fact, college costs have steadily ris-en faster than inflation for years, meaning ev-ery semester students (and their parents) are spending a larger percentage of their salaries on education, leading to an average student-loan debt of $20,000 by graduation. 
Considering a quarter of those students 
will pay even more including late fees, it’s not surprising that 7.2 percent of students drop out of college due to financial pressure. That means more than a million people end their pursuit of higher education every year because university tuition is out of control. Those are millions of doctors, lawyers and corporate executives this country loses.
It’s not just the possibility of losing some 
great minds, but also the social mobility that higher education brings. Studies have con-sistently shown a college degree results in a higher salary and with it, a higher standing in society. But with tuition becoming so expen-sive and more lower-middle-class students postponing their degrees indefinitely, social mobility becomes less and less likely . In fact, a 2010 report issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showed that in the United States, parental background has the highest influence on stu-dent achievement out of all OECD countries.
Western Europe, where heavily funded 
universities dominate, is where social mobil-ity seems to be most prevalent. The estimat-ed tuition cost at UF for the fall of 2011 was $5,657. When you account for books, supplies and health insur -
ance, that cost easily increases by about $2,000. However, in Sweden, schools 
don’t charge any tuition for citizens of any European Union nation. In Germany, univer -
sities such as the Berlin School of Econom-ics and Law charge a mere $325 a semester; in Spain, college can cost as little as $25 per credit.
But the idea of the U.S. adopting such edu-
cation policies seems highly unlikely . Even with an important election coming up this year, no candidate has talked about education reform. And why should they? College stu-dents have consistently come to the polls with low turnout. From a politician’s point of view, why spend energy courting the approval of a demographic that has little influence on your re-election capabilities? And with budget cuts being introduced by Congress and Gov. Scott, it’s not surprising that America’s education system is in a defunct state.
By cutting waste in the government and 
redirecting formerly squandered money to the U.S. Department of Education, a free uni-versity could be possible. Eliminating Satur -
day mail delivery alone could save about $3 billion a year, and if we terminate the Govern-ment Printing Office by moving Congressio-nal hearing information online, we could save $8 billion. Those are two things that could po-tentially bring more than $11 billion in new grants and scholarships annually without one tax increase. But this type of change seems to be a distant dream until college students get more involved in politics and force govern-ment to hear their needs.

City and university officials 
met Tuesday afternoon to discuss 
creating a new city district around Gainesville’s up-and-coming Inno-vation Square.
Gainesville City Commissioners 
Jeanna Mastrodicasa, Todd Chase and Randy Wells met with univer -
sity officials who are overseeing the project to consider establishing a Business Improvement District to encompass the newly developed area.
The district would give Inno-
vation Square the ability to make its own rules regarding issues such as landscaping, trash pickup and marketing strategies, said Ed Poppell, who works with the UF Development Corp. and who has overseen the project since it began in 2010. 
Innovation Square covers 40 acres around Southwest Second Avenue where Alachua General Hospital once stood. It is a proj-ect funded by the city and UF that aims to create an urban envi-ronment consisting of residential space, high-tech businesses, retail-ers and restaurants. 
Allowing Innovation Square to 
have its own district would pro-mote collaboration between the city government, the stakeholders and the residents, said James Izzo, development consultant for UF De-velopment Corp., at the meeting. 
“It would function like a neigh-
borhood association, but with a lot more pull,” Poppell said in an in-terview.
The commissioners liked the 
idea and agreed to discuss the exact boundaries of the proposed Business Improvement District at the next commission meeting.
Commissioners also decided to 
talk more about changing parking areas in and around Innovation Square at the next commission meeting. 
Officials would like special 
permits to build parking garages instead of parking lots to provide more room for buildings. 8, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 25, 2012

ARRESTED TUESDAY.

Gainesville Police arrested members of the 
group Sons of Graffiti on Tuesday and charged 
them with two counts of criminal mischief and one count of burglary.
Charles Allen Delong, 24, and Michael Ter -
rance Steele, 20, admitted to tagging numer -
ous businesses, signs and utility boxes around Gainesville, according to a police report.
Delong said he tagged as “SO” and “SIN 
ONE.” Other tags the group used are “S.O.G.,” “TWIG” and “BUD76.”
Delong admitted to tagging three tour buses 
belonging to American Education Tours parked in the Americas Best Value Inn lot at 1900 SW 13th St. on Jan. 17. The cost to repaint the buses was estimated at $15,000, according to the re-port.
On the morning of Jan. 12, the group broke 
into Continuum Apartments, a UF graduate com-munity. Police have video surveillance showing one of the members of the group letting the rest in. It is unknown how they gained access to the building, the report said. The group caused an estimated $500 in damage to the property.
The report says additional charges against 
Steele, Delong and other members of Sons of Graffiti are forthcoming.Graffiti group

Most people wouldn’t want to step in a pile of smelly zebra 
dung, but researchers at Tulane University are jumping right 
into it.
Scientists have found a bacterium called TU-103 in the waste 
of African zebras, which might be the solution to a cheaper en-zyme for biofuel, according to The New York Times.
Tim Sink, an intern at UF’s Bioenergy and Sustainable Tech-
nologies Laboratory, said the available enzymes are expensive to use, so finding another microbe is essential to the economic efficiency of a biofuel project. 
He said it’s hard to guess whether the new enzyme will be 
successful because research is conducted on a trial-and-error basis. 
Pratap Pullammanappallil, who teaches environmental 
biotechnology at UF, said animal droppings are commonly used to create another alternative energy source called biogas, a replacement for natural gas. 
Jonathan Miot, director of the Santa Fe College Teaching 
Zoo, said zebras, which are in the same taxonomic family as horses, have especially strong stomachs. 
Miot referred to them as a garbage dump, because while 
most animals have trouble digesting various species of grass-es, zebras can eat all of them.
Miot said zebras have excellent digestive systems due to 
the bacteria in their guts. 
When a zebra eats, the bacteria break down cellulose, a 
substance indigestible to mammals. 
The bacteria produce a waste called volatile fatty acid, 
which the zebra uses as energy. 
Zebras’ bacteria just happen to be right for biofuel re-
search.
“They eat, and they poop,” Miot said. “It’s what they do all 
day anyways.” 
But zebras can be dangerous to handle. They have a strong 
kick, which, he said, is equivalent to the power of a hand gre-nade explosion.
Scientists won’t need to continue to gather droppings from 
captive zebras because the enzymes can be reproduced in a laboratory, Pullammanappallil said. 
Miot said Tulane’s project has the potential to inpsire new 
ideas about how to harness animals’ capabilities.
“There is a lot of stuff out there that we have no idea 
[about],” he said. “Animals are a lot more creative than we think, though it’s not intentional.”Researchers to use zebra dung in biofuel project

The Unite Party will publicly announce 
its presidential candidate for Student 
Government Spring Elections today . 
At 12:35 p.m. on the Reitz Union North 
Lawn, a member of the Unite Party will announce his or her candidacy . 
The Unite Party hopes to announce the 
treasurer and vice presidential candidates Wednesday.
“We want the [presidential candidate] 
to have adequate time to hold inter -
views,” Unite Party spokeswoman Chris-tina Bonarrigo said. 
The presidential candidate will inter -
view applicants for the other two positions and make the final selec-tion. 
The presidential and 
vice presidential candi-dates run on the same 
ticket, and all three candidates are from the same party , she said.   
Students Party Sen. Carly Wilson said 
her party has not yet decided on a candi-date. Qualifying and slating don’t end until 
Tuesday, and the party wants to encour -
age any qualified student to apply , she said. 
Qualifying determines whether a can-
didate is qualified for the job. Students can interview with a political party to have the party’s support as its slated candidate.
Wilson said when a Students Party 
candidate is chosen, he or she will be an-nounced by party members who will talk with different organizations about the candidate.

Gainesville will receive the 
insight of a former presidential 
candidate days before the Florida Republican primary.
Former New York City Mayor 
Rudy Giuliani will speak at the Phillips Center for the Perform-ing Arts at 8 p.m. on Thursday. 
He will receive $65,000 for his 
appearance.
Doors open at 7 p.m. Seating 
is on a first-come, first-served basis. No ticket is necessary, and the show is free and open to the public. 
Corey Portnoy, chairman of 
ACCENT Speakers Bureau, said Giuliani might  discuss endorsing a Republican presidential candi-
date during his speech. 
Portnoy said 
the show is a great opportu-nity to hear and 
learn from an in-fluential leader.
“Giuliani was 
at the center of our country at a time of a national crisis, and stu-dents should be able to connect with him,” he said. 
UF political science professor 
David Hedge said he expects the former mayor to have an interest-ing perspective on politics and national security concerns. 
A Q&A session will follow the 
speech. 
A moderator will ask selected 
audience questions submitted be-fore the speech, Portnoy said.Security at the Phillips Center 
will be tightened Thursday night. All small bags will be checked and no backpacks will be allowed.
Giuliani was mayor of New 
York City from 1994 to 2001 and 
a Republican presidential candi-date in 2008. 
He was recognized as Time’s 
Person of the Year in 2001.

At a discussion Tuesday night about a controversial 
Gainesville power plant, even the youngest  participant 
expressed concern.
Ben Morris, 12, explained his feelings on the issue 
during the Q&A session of the presentation, which was hosted by the Civic Media Center.
“My teacher at school has a quote of the day , and I 
think this one goes along with the issue with GRU,” he said. “It goes, ‘Don’t ask the barber if you need a hair -
cut.’”
The discussion was about a biomass plant project 
that broke ground in October. The plant will run on wood and household waste. About 25 people attended the discussion.
The presentation was organized in order to keep the community informed, said Robby Czopek, a Civic Me-dia Center staff member.
During the presentation, a small, heated debate broke 
out between two audience members about where a por -
tion of the money for the project would be going.
The event speaker, Paula Stahmer, said she believes 
the project is “lousy, polluting and financially ruinous to the community.”
“It is important to talk about this issue because there 
is a lot of misinformation out there, and this is an oppor -
tunity to set the record straight,” Stahmer said.
The Civic Media Center is a local nonprofit organiza-
tion dedicated to providing resources for activists and access to points of view not represented in for-profit me-dia, according to its website. WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 25, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 9

� CITY ELECTIONS AND THE 
REPUBLICAN PRIMARY WILL BE JAN. 31.
JOVAHN HUERTAS
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Gainesville city elections are 
fast approaching, and, if two UF 
organizations have anything to say about it, students will be flocking to the polls.
Elections, which will be on Jan. 
31, will match eight candidates against one another for the at-large 1 seat of the Gainesville City Com-mission, three candidates for the District 1 seat and candidates for the Republican Presidential Prefer -
ence Primary.
In the March city elections, 57 
people voted at the Reitz Union polling site. 
UF College Democrats hopes to 
change the low number of student voters with its Vote 100 campaign, which aims to convince at least 100 UF students to vote this year.
Kyle Pendergrass, vice president 
of political affairs for the UF Col-lege Democrats, said the campaign includes collecting students’ com-mitments to vote on either election day or in early voting, calling com-mitted voters with reminders be-fore the elections and offering rides to polling locations. In addition, members will be 
advertising outside the Reitz Union on election day.  The campaign has been successful so far, gaining 26 commitments in its first week.
“Our goal is to make [the pro-
cess] as easy as possible for voters,” he said.The city elections may seem 
trivial to some students, Pender -
grass said, but city officials make decisions on issues that directly af-fect student life, such as apartment rates and bus routes.
“We’re here for four years,” Pen-
dergrass said. “It’s our home, and we need to have a voice in how the city does business.”
The UF College Republicans 
will also be active on election day.  However, its strategy is a bit differ -
ent from previous years.
Matt Pesek, UF College Repub-
licans spokesman,  said the club’s focus is getting registered Repub-licans to the polls because the Re-publican Presidential Preference Primary is on the same day.
“On election day, we will be ta-
bling on both Plaza of the Americas and Turlington Plaza with infor -
mation on each candidate,” Pesek said. 
The primary and city candidates 
are placed on the same ballot, mean-ing voting in the primaries gives people the chance to vote in city elections.  In any case, Pesek said, making the commitment to vote is key to an active political life.
“If you really want an influence 
on how the government is run, you must vote,” he said.12, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 25, 2012

Dr. Narendra Kini knows how today’s medical 
landscape works. 
“Health care is changing in front of our eyes,” he 
said.
He spoke spoke to 14 people Tuesday night at 
Graham Gallery about his life and career, the chang-
ing landscape of modern medicine and the essen-tials to success for all careers. 
Kini is the president and CEO of Miami Chil-
dren’s Hospital. Kini, who is board-certified in pediatric emer -
gency medicine and holds a mas-ter’s degree in hospital admin-istration, assumed his current position in 2008. 
He spoke for free. The event 
was sponsored by the Indian Stu-dent Association.
“Most of our events are cul-
turally based, and we wanted to bring something new to ISA,” said Satvika Ponnavolu, 21-year-old UF biology senior and president of ISA.
Kini focused his talk on the need for medical pro-
fessionals to adapt to the Information Age.
“Data is exploding at four times the rate it used to 
every four months,” he said.  “The solution is  data has to come to you at the point of care.”
He stressed that flexible skill sets and teamwork 
are the most important criteria to get a job today.
“At the end of the day, success comes from team-
work and the ability to understand how the other person works,” Kini said.Hospital CEO

About 150 people attended a screen-
ing of a documentary about the por-
trayal of influential American women at the Reitz Union auditorium Tuesday night. 
Reitz Union Board Entertainment 
featured the film’s first premiere in Florida. The crowd nearly filled the au-ditorium.
“Miss Representation” focused on 
the sexualizing of women in today’s media industries. It featured interviews and commentary from women such as comedian Margaret Cho, journalist and television host Lisa Ling and former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
Liz Martin, interim director of vio-
lence prevention at Peaceful Paths Domestic Abuse Network, and UF se-nior and Peaceful Paths intern Olivia Soutullo led a discussion panel after the movie. 
Martin said she was pleased with 
the overall outcome of the event.
Peaceful Paths co-sponsored the 
event with the UF Women’s Student Association and Student Government.
Peaceful Paths intern and 19-year-old psychology and criminology soph-omore Jasmine Esmailbegui said the documentary changed her perspective on media.
“The most substantial thing for me 
was how unaware I was that I was being bombarded,” she said. “I prob-ably won’t watch reality television ever again or buy another tabloid.”
Nineteen-year-old hospitality and 
tourism sophomore Kelly Colomberti is a member of the UF Women’s Student Alliance and a self-proclaimed feminist and humanist. 
“It was a powerful and concise way 
to get the message out in a way for peo-ple to finally understand,” she said. “We don’t need to become defensive about the term and idea of feminism. No one loses when we respect women.”

Gainesville-based music streaming business Grooveshark 
is taking applications for its free, semester-long workshop, 
Grooveshark University. Applications are due Thursday.
This will be the program’s fourth semester teaching students 
in-depth software and computer development.
Unlike previous semesters, Grooveshark University is now 
offering two tracks for students. One will work with mobile de-velopment for Android phones, and the other will take ideas and programming skills and apply them to the real-world tech-nological industry.
Paulo Dasilva, senior software engineer at Grooveshark, 
said the number of applicants for the program has been grow-ing each semester, leading to increasingly overcrowded classes. As a result, they will cut back the number of students accepted from about 60 to between 32 and 40.
“That way , we can talk to people one-on-one to look at what they’re trying to do, see what problems they’re having,” Dasilva said. “It makes it a lot more personal.”
Dasilva will teach the real world development track. Dave 
Small, a UF computer science professor, will teach the Android development track.
Applicants are not required to be computer science majors 
but are expected to have experience with programming. If you know one programming language or have made a program, you probably have enough experience, Dasilva said. 
Applicants will be notified Friday night of Grooveshark Uni-
versity’s decision.
“Just because you’re in college doesn’t mean you can’t ac-
complish or make a big company or launch a cool product,” Dasilva said. “All you need is just a little push.”Grooveshark University accepting applications

Gators High in Preseason Rankings
Florida’s baseball team checked in at No. 1 in Tuesday’s 
Baseball America preseason poll, while the softball team came in at No. 2 in the USA Today/NFCA poll.Gators Find Replacement for Pantoni
Florida has hired Jon Haskins to replace departed recruiting coordinator Mark Pantoni, who left last month to join Urban Meyer’s staff at Ohio State. Haskins previously worked in the same role at Nevada and Stanford. After suffering injuries to both ankles, sophomore Mackenzie Caquatto has returned to competition for UF’s gymnastics team. See story, page 19.

Alligator Staff Writer
 
On a team filled with new starters 
and changing roles, Scottie Wilbekin 
has been content to see his responsi-bilities remain static during his soph-omore year.
As the Gators’ backup point guard, 
Wilbekin saw firsthand earlier this season how difficult it was for start-ing senior Erving Walker to get used to more of a passing role after being a shoot-first guard his first three years.
At the time, Florida was also trying 
to break in two new frontline players as well as freshman guard Brad Beal.
“It’s been tough for everybody, but 
I think [Erving’s] done a good job of it, leading our team, trying to focus on getting assists than scoring,” Wil-bekin said. “I think it just shows how good of a player he is to make a trans-formation after three years of being a scorer.”
Much like last season, Wilbekin 
has been used mostly as a defensive substitute by coach Billy Donovan. Wilbekin’s averages of 2.4 points and 1.4 rebounds per game are almost identical to a year ago, and he’s also on pace to match his steals and assists output.
“Scottie has pretty much come off 
the bench like he always has,” Dono-van said.
But with the addition of Beal and 
Rutgers transfer Mike Rosario to an already crowded backcourt, the 6-foot-2 Wilbekin has had his playing time decrease from 17.1 minutes each game to 13.7 minutes. 
While he is seeing the floor less, 
Wilbekin said he doesn’t think his role is decreasing for the Gators. Against LSU on Saturday, Wilbekin rebounded from a five-minute, score-less showing a week earlier at South Carolina with five points and three assists in 15 minutes of playing time.Wilbekin fine with fewer

Florida’s post play has arguably been 
its biggest weakness this season.
With the exception of junior forward 
Jennifer George, the Gators’ forwards 
and centers have been inconsistent and underwhelming, statistically speaking.
Part of Florida’s problem down low 
is a lack of depth.
UF has just three forwards and one 
center on their active roster, not includ-ing redshirted center Viktorija Dimaite.
However, the frontcourt will be even 
thinner going into next season.
The only returning post players who 
have logged significant playing time this season are George and redshirt sopho-more Lily Svete, whose offensive game is perimeter-based.“Since [Dimaite]’s gotten completely 
healthy, she has made a really great im-pression on us during practice,” coach Amanda Butler said. “Obviously , we know what we’re going to get from 
George and [Svete].”
With only George, 
Svete and Dimaite listed as forwards and centers on the official roster going into next 
season, the Gators will not have many experienced post players, but their top 
competition will.
No. 6 Kentucky , No. 7 Tennessee, No. 
14 Texas A&M, and No. 17 Georgia will all field rosters with at least five 6-footers next season.Gators may be scrambling 
for post players next year
See W-HOOPS, PA ge 20Tom: Let’s get 
this out of the way off 
the bat: Florida is a football school. The school’s small sports are always threats to make a run at a national title, though. 
With the semester underway and the spring 
season about to rev up for Gators athletics, you have to wonder: Which Florida team has the best chance to bring a national title back to Gainesville this year?
There are plenty of contenders on campus, 
but to me, the answer is simple: The Gators baseball team stands the best chance of sitting atop its sport by season’s end.
John: True, that is a “simple” answer Tom-
my Boy.
I know this is a free, student-run newspa-
per and it’s my first time in The Rally , but at least give the people an inkling as to why the UF baseball team will be able to du-plicate last year’s College World Series run. I’d say it’s the Gators’ returning pitching rotation, Mike Zunino’s bat and a Baseball Amer -
ica preseason No. 1 ranking for the second con-secutive year, and that’s just for starters.
But here I am getting ahead of myself, giv-
ing you hints for what surely will be a feeble argument and forgetting the growing power -
house program that is almost guaranteed to be the first team  to bring a national championship to Gainesville in 2012.
In just its third year in existence, the Florida 
women’s lacrosse team has already become a national contender alongside perennial favor -Which spring sport is most 
likely to bring home a title?

Junior tennis player Lauren Embree, who clinched the NCAA title for the Gators 
last season, is ranked No. 25 in the ITA individual rankings to start the year. 
� FLORIDA HOSTS TROY TODAY AT 3 
P.M. IN LINDER STADIUM. 
ELI MARGER
Alligator Writer
 
When a championship team returns all of 
its starters the following season, one word im-
mediately comes to mind — repeat.
For the No. 1 Florida women’s tennis team, 
a second straight national championship is clearly in the crosshairs. The Gators will begin their road back to the NCAA Championships on Wednesday when they host Troy at 3 p.m. in Linder Stadium. 
Under the guidance of Roland Thornqvist, 
who could notch his 250th victory as Florida’s coach with a win Wednesday, the Gators are returning all seven players from last year’s team. 
Thornqvist, however, says that expecta-
tions this year are no different than in years past.
“Our players almost every year in my 11 
years here have had the same goal,” he said. “We don’t really talk about those things, hon-estly. We try to make each month its own chap-ter and try to improve individually month by month.”
With the team returning every player, the 
Gators are more mature and deeper than they were last year and have become close-knit.
“We’re great friends on the team,” junior 
Lauren Embree said. “We don’t have any problems, so that just really helps the team and that’s probably a big part (of) why we did so well last year.”
Embree is one of three Gators currently ranked in the top 25 nationally. Joining the 25th-ranked Embree are No. 3 Allie Will and No. 4 Joanna Mather. 
Beyond those three, No. 34 Sofie Oyen and 
No. 41 Alex Cercone will also play major roles on the team. 
Yet where many teams lag behind in the 
fifth and sixth slots in their singles rotation, the Gators are extremely strong. Junior Caro-line Hitimana and sophomore Olivia Janowicz were a combined 32-3 in singles play last year. Earlier this month, Hitimana won the conso-lation singles title at the Freeman Memorial Championship in Las Vegas. 
It’s all part of the Gators’ pedigree, says 
Thornqvist. 
“That’s why we try to recruit successful ju-
nior players, players who are not only skilled but they’re used to winning.”
With nationally ranked teams like North 
Carolina, Duke, Stanford and Baylor on the schedule, repeating as national champions will be no cakewalk. 
“It’s very hard to repeat, and we have the 
same team, so we’re all just going to work as hard as we can and hopefully the hard work will pay off,” Embree said.
Following Wednesday’s opener, the Gators 
have a home match against UCF before open-ing a daunting month of February during which they play No. 2 Stanford, No. 8 North Carolina, No. 18 Florida State and No. 42 South Florida.
“Every time we set out to practice, our goal 
is obviously May,” Will said. “But we have a lot of tough teams to play before then, and I think the goal is just to get better every day and be as well prepared in May as we pos-sibly can.”No. 1 Gators begin NCAA title defensegymnAS ticS

When Mackenzie Caquatto sprained and tore 
ligaments in both of her ankles last September 
during the final selection camp for the 2011 U.S. world team, her dreams also snapped. 
After Caquatto landed short on her double-
pike dismount on balance beam, she suffered a bilateral ankle sprain, taking her out of the run-ning to make the U.S. team for the 2011 World Championships and Pan American Games.
The U.S. roster, which Caquatto would have 
likely made if she could have remained healthy, was announced two days after her injuries oc-curred. 
“I was obviously aiming to make the world 
team,” Caquatto said. “Not only did my ankles hurt, but I actually hurt inside because of all of the work I put in that summer. I had expecta-tions and they kind of all just went away in the blink of an eye.”
Because of all the pain and swelling she felt in 
her ankles, Caquatto said she couldn’t sleep for three weeks. 
Throughout that period, she couldn’t walk 
and was forced to remain in a wheelchair. 
Florida’s coaching staff was worried that Ca-
quatto, who was a key contributor on beam and uneven bars for the Gators last year as a fresh-man, could possibly miss the majority of the 2012 season. 
“When you have severe ligament tears in both 
ankles, it’s worse than a break,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. 
Caquatto rehabbed with her athletic trainer 
three times a day and took part in physical ther -apy sessions twice a week. She also visited her chiropractor weekly. 
When not in rehab or physical therapy, she 
wore two protective boots.
On a scale of 1-10, Caquatto said her desire to 
get back to competing was at a “12.”
“It was killing me that I couldn’t be out there,” 
she said.  
After she made significant progress in her re-
habilitation, Caquatto made her season debut on the bars against Kentucky last Friday, recording a solid 9.775.
“It was a great return for her,” Faehn said. 
“She still was a little tentative on the landing, so she didn’t necessarily go for the stick, which is fine.”
When No. 8 Florida hosts its first quad meet of 
the season against No. 1 Arkansas, No. 24 Mary-land and Bridgeport on Friday night, Caquatto will compete on bars again. 
Also, Faehn said Caquatto would join the 
beam lineup within the next month and return to performing her floor exercise toward the end of the season.
While Caquatto averaged an exceptionally 
high 9.86 on both bars and beam last season, she said she sees herself returning back to prime form by year’s end. 
“Hopefully, by the end of the season, I’ll get 
back up there,” Caquatto said. Caquatto returns from serious injuries
“I had expectations and they kind of all 
just went away in the blink of an eye.”

UF gymnast“With all the good players 
on this team, you can’t really 
get mad because every person on the team is a good player, so you just got to get in the game and work your hard-est,” Wilbekin said.
Though Wilbekin has im-
proved his outside shooting from last season five percent-age points to 33.3 percent, the most important facet he has added to his game has been his maturity level on the court.
In practices and during 
games, Wilbekin said Dono-van has had to remind the Gators to have a short mem-ory when facing adversity on the road.
“If you have one guy who’s 
upset because he missed two free throws and he’s running back on defense and he’s not 
tuned into what’s go-ing on, 
you’re go-ing to break d o w n , ” D o n o v a n said. “Those are things, 
maturity-wise, that you have to understand that you’re not getting that play back.”

HOOPS , from page 17Wilbekin more mature, 
improving 3-point shotFlorida facing size deficit next season
Barring late signees, Florida will only have four, with 
just two standing 6 foot 2 inches or taller. UGA will have 
six at least that tall, and UK, A&M and UT will all have three or more. 
Butler has nabbed forward Christen Mercer and 
guards Sydney Moss, Chandler Cooper and January Miller in her latest recruiting class.
Moss and Cooper are ranked No. 50 and No. 51, re-
spectively , in the 2012 ESPNU HoopGurlz 100 and boast four-star rankings along with Miller.
Mercer — a 6-foot, three-star prospect — is the 
Gators’ only post player signed.
However, experience at a specific position, or at the 
collegiate level, does not concern Butler in regards to who she will put out on the court next season.
“We also have in that freshman class Sydney Moss, 
who can play [power forward], Christen Mercer, who can play [power forward],” Butler said. “Anyone we add in late signing would have to work with what we already have.”
Butler puts a lot of trust in the forwards and centers 
she does recruit by not seeking out other top talent at those positions.
The 2012 ESPNU HoopGurlz 100 lists three Floridian 
6-footers in Alexis Prince, Macy Keen and Hillary Fuller, but none of them considered signing with the Gators.In her last three classes, Butler has signed eight high 
school prospects and only three of them have been for -
wards or centers. The highest-ranked recruit of the trio — Deaundra Young from the 2010 class — transferred before the start of this season.
In addition to her heavy recruitment of perimeter 
prep players, Butler also added two JUCO transfers pri-or to last season in Lanita Bartley and Deana Allen, both of whom are guards.
One potential cause for Butler’s affinity for guards 
may be Florida’s emphasis on the transition game.
The Gators have employed a three-guard lineup 
since Butler’s arrival and switched to a more up-tempo 
style at the be-ginning of last season.
However, 
Butler shot down that notion, remarking, “It just seems that way.”
Butler said that she is always recruiting and that Flor -
ida is currently evaluating some potential late signees to add to its 2012 haul.
Already guard-heavy, it’s possible Butler will be 
looking to add some much-needed size to the paint.

ites like Maryland and Northwestern. Just 
last season, the Gators shocked the collegiate lacrosse landscape when they beat the 2011 NCAA champion Wildcats at home to win their first American Lacrosse Conference title.
UF returns 11 of 12 starters — all sopho-
mores and  juniors — from an Elite Eight team that went 16-4 overall and 5-0 in ALC play.
Though the Gators are still a young team, 
they’ve had no problems learning how to win quickly.
Tom: What is this, the final rap battle scene 
from “8 Mile”?
“This guy’s no [expletive] MC, I know every-
thing he’s got to say against me.”
Look Boothe, while I admire your pre-
emptive strike to shoot down  my argument, you’ve only scratched the surface as to why Kevin O’Sullivan and his boys have the best chance to snag an NCAA title.
Yes, the Gators return their weekend rota-
tion of Hudson Randall, Brian Johnson and Karsten Whitson, but they also add a formi-dable midweek starter in freshman Johnny Magliozzi. According to scouting reports, Ma-gliozzi has a monster curveball, a fastball that hits in the 90s and a kneebuckling changeup. Oh, and he’s not afraid to get in the face of op-posing batters when he rings them up. He’s a real-life Kenny Powers, really.
Mix that in with the versatile Johnson, 
Whitson and the most-feared redhead since the “Child’s Play” movies, and you’re looking at the best college rotation. And at this level, pitching wins titles.
John: One ... two ... yep, that’s three pop 
culture references in one retort. I would say I’m impressed, Tom, but you beat me to it and already humble-bragged on Twitter.

While you’re busy pining for retweets, I’m 
trying to give the readers substance.
Though both certainly return a wealth 
of talent, Florida lacrosse has something UF baseball doesn’t — the best offensive player in the game.
Gators attacker Kitty Cullen spent her All-
American sophomore campaign leading the nation in scoring during the regular season with 77 goals and had a hat trick in 16 of the Gators’ 20 games.
When she wasn’t peppering opponents on 
one of her four six-goal games, Cullen was challenging the NCAA record books.She owns the second-fastest goal to start a 
game in NCAA history, needing just eight sec-onds to score last April against Penn State.
In many ways, Cullen’s offensive jump fol-
lowing a 31-goal freshman season mirrors her team’s inaugural 2010 season, in which the Gators finished 10-8.
Who knows if it’s the top-notch facilities or 
training in the Florida heat, but the sudden im-provements UF saw with Cullen and the rest of its team aren’t seen very often in any sport.
Tom: Pining for retweets? If anything, I 
was just teasing our loyal readers for what to look forward to today — and trying to give you a much-needed bump in followers.
While Cullen is a force to be reckoned with, 
the baseball team also happens to tout one of the best offensive players in the game in Zu-nino. You remember him, right Boothe? After all, you did mention the reigning Southeastern Conference Player of the Year earlier.
Zunino led Florida in a multitude of of-
fensive categories: total bases (178), hits (98), runs (75), doubles (23), home runs (19), slug-ging percentage (.674) and on-base percentage (.442) — all as a sophomore.
Zunino’s back to not only wreak havoc 
on opposing pitchers, but to handle Florida’s loaded pitching staff, too. His defense and ability to help call games with Sully are vi-tal, but his offensive contributions can’t be overlooked. Oh, and Zunino has protection throughout the batting order in the form of Johnson, Nolan Fontana, Austin Maddox and Preston Tucker.
That lineup should have you scared to 
death, scared to look and shook, because there’s no such thing as halfway crooks — and this team stands the best chance to go all the way.
John: Aside from Cullen, the Gators also 
have an arsenal of offensive weapons. Juniors Ashley Bruns and Brittany Dashiell are both known, potent scorers, but Florida still has a few surprises left to spring on its opponents this season.
Coach Amanda O’Leary has become argu-
ably the best recruiter in women’s lacrosse, with three straight top-five classes. Florida’s current crop of juniors was part of O’Leary’s No. 1 rated class, according to Inside Lacrosse, and this year’s third-ranked haul is no slouch either, with four of the seven freshmen ranked in the top 20.
By the end of this season these players will 
be doing more than just contributing, they’ll be helping the Gators lift their first national championship trophy.
