Unsuccessful escape attempt leaves Arizona inmate nearly naked
PHOENIX — A Phoenix jail inmate 
was left wearing nothing but pink socks 
after scaling five fences in an escape at-tempt before he was captured. 
The Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office 
says 24-year-old Clayton Thornburg suf-fered cuts on parts of his body since some of the Durango Jail’s fences are 15 feet high and topped with razor wire.
Jail officials said the razor wire had 
stripped away Thornburg’s jail uniform and pink underwear by the time he reached the last fence Thursday morning. He was treated at the Maricopa County Medical Center.
Authorities said Thornburg likely will 
face an additional felony charge of escape, which can add up to five years to an in-mate’s sentence. They said Thornburg was in jail for an extensive number of property crime charges.

For the first time in three years, the 
Gators are the bait.
No. 7 Florida will play an unfamil-
iar role when it takes the field Saturday 
against top-ranked Alabama in Tuscaloo-sa: underdog.
After sitting atop the college football 
mountain for much of the past two sea-sons, UF finds itself looking up at the Crimson Tide, winners of 28 straight regu-lar-season games and the team that booted 
Florida from its lofty perch last December en route to a national title.
Memories of the last time the teams met 
still haunt the Gators.
Behind running back Mark Ingram’s 
three touchdowns and a second-half shut-
out, ’Bama turned in a stunning 32-13 win in the 2009 Southeastern Conference 
Championship. The Tide were dominant, 
and the performance left Florida players lost for words.
“Ever since that game ... it’s unexplain-
able,” UF linebacker Brandon Hicks said. “I wanted it back so bad. That game hurt 
so bad because we felt like we had the 
team to win, but we didn’t execute every-thing the way we’re supposed to. “We took it upon ourselves that our 
preparation wasn’t right, and we didn’t do the things we needed to succeed in that game.”
Preparation — not revenge — has been 
the buzzword this week. Af-ter all, most of these Gators had nothing to do with that loss. Of the 70 players who 
traveled to Tennessee two 
weeks ago, 41 percent were 
freshmen.
UF coach Urban Meyer placed the 
blame for his team’s lack of focus last sea-
son on its “rock star status,” something 
that shouldn’t be an issue after a precari-ous start to the season.
Florida (4-0, 2-0 SEC) rebounded in last 
week’s 48-14 win against Kentucky, post-ing its best offensive outing of the year. 
Solid performances from quarterback 
John Brantley, a much-maligned receiving corps and do-it-all freshman Trey Burton were the reasons for the resurgence, and it’ll take a similar outing to succeed in 
Bryant-Denny Stadium, where ’Bama has 
won 16 in a row.
“The point is, we better be locked and 
loaded,” Meyer said. “The positive thing is we’ve now learned how to practice. The 
negative is we’re still extremely young 
and inexperienced, but the improvement — you can witness it now.” UF in unfamiliar territory against Alabama

Tom Hand signs a Pink Heals fire truck Thursday with the word ‘survivor’ under his name at  
the Bo Diddley Community Plaza. A firefighter with Gainesville Fire Rescue Station 2, Hand has been fighting cancer for the past 10 1/2 months. The idea for Pink Heals firetrucks be-gan in Arizona with one truck, $3,000 and the hopes of spreading awareness. There are now about 30 trucks that tour the U.S. raising money from shirt sales to support the fleet and its cause. Each Pink Heals truck is covered in writing in honor of any man, woman or child who is fighting, diagnosed with or has died from cancer.
� MONDAY IS THE LAST DAY 
TO REGISTER TO VOTE IN THE NOVEMBER ELECTION.
By JON sILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer
V oting, on the surface, is easy . 
You go in a booth, color some 
ovals and get a sticker.
There are, however, some key 
things voters need to know before 
they go and exercise that  important 
democratic privilege that separates us from the North Koreans.
The general electionis on Nov . 2, 
but the deadline for registering to vote in Alachua County is Monday. 
According to Alachua County 
Supervisor of Elections Pam Carpen-
ter, you must have your registration 
completed by 5 p.m. Monday, or it must be postmarked by Monday.
Everyone can register at the Su-
pervisor’s office downtown or go online to www.votealachua.com and click the link on the home page. 
The form needs a signature, so 
it would have to be printed out and 
then either turned in or mailed. 
You can register all over town.
UF campus? Check.Public library? Check.Walmart? Check and mate.
The sooner you register, the bet-
ter, to ensure the correct name will 
appear on the correct poll register. 
Carpenter said get it done now 
so that you can do your homework and lubricate the sometimes tedious process of voting.
“If you go in cold, it could take 
you 20 minutes to do,” she said.
After registration, voters will re-
ceive a sample ballot in the mail, and Carpenter said it’s a good idea to 
take it with you to the polling place.
If you’re al-
ready registered in another county and want to vote 
in Alachua, you 
must submit a change of address on a voter regis-
tration application.
The most important thing is 
knowledge of one’s precinct.  Dif-
ferent precincts have different races 
on the ballot.  To vote,  you need a 
picture ID with a signature like a driver’s license, state-issued ID or school ID.
For any questions or concerns 
call the Supervisor of Elections Of-fice at 352-374-5252.County supervisor gives voting tipsFootball

Students got a chance 
Thursday to learn about be-
coming green Gators. 
Gators Going Green, a Stu-
dent Government-run agency 
comprised of about 20 orga-nizations focused on promot-
ing sustainability on campus, 
hosted the Sustainability Fair for the first time.
The fair, held on the Reitz 
Union Colonnade,  was de-signed to educate students about conservation and op-portunities to get involved on campus.
“One girl came by and 
asked, ‘I kind of recycle because my friends recycle and it looks good, but I don’t really un-
derstand why ,’” said Heather 
Green, secretary for Gators for a Sustainable Campus. “That’s what we explain.”
Ten tables were set up throughout the day represent-ing student organizations such as RecycleMania and the UF 
Office of Sustainability. Stu-
dents who visited at least two 
tables received reusable bags filled with SG giveaways, like sunglasses and buttons. 
Bailey Kilbourne, execu-
tive director of Gators Going Green, said the organization plans on hosting another fair in the spring. 
“We can all come together 
in one location and spread the word about sustainability , work as a team and get more 
people involved,” she said.Students peruse green groups, get goodies at fair

David Bean accepted a trade from a customer in 
the 1990s that is now funding a new pharmaceutical 
wing at the UF Research and Academic Center in Lake 
Nona. 
A customer gave Bean five acres of land just outside 
of Celebration to pay off his prescription bills, and after Bean’s wife died in 2000, he donated the land to UF.
The university sold the land, and the proceeds from 
that sale totaled $1.2 million, according to Kelly Mar -
key, senior director of development at the UF College of Pharmacy. 
Bean asked for the donation to go toward establish-
ing a campus near Orlando for pharmacy students, ac-cording to a university press release. 
The new campus in Lake Nona will be named after 
Bean and his late wife, Helen. A class of 1952 alumnus, Bean graduated from the 
UF College of Pharmacy. He worked in the pharma-ceutical industry for over 35 years and purchased his own store in 1966. He expanded the business with the help of his late wife.
“He credits her with being the reason behind his 
success,” Markey said. “She helped run the business side.”
The new pharmacy campus will be located within 
the UF Research and Academic Center in 
Orlando. The 100,000-square-foot project 
cost about $40 million.
“The center will help our Orlando 
campus expand and grow,” said Bill Millard, execu-tive associate dean of the College of Pharmacy. About  200 pharmacy students will get their pharmaceutical degrees, and 20 graduate students will earn degrees in comprehensive drug research and pharmacodynam-ics. 
The center will open Oct. 5.Grad funds new pharmacy campus

It’s been more than 20 years since 
Frank Wickes and Linda Moorhouse 
were members of the UF Gator band, but they returned to their old stomping grounds as honored 
guests Thursday night.
Wickes and Moorhouse were 
inducted into the UF Band Hall of 
Fame and took turns guest conduct-ing during the celebratory concert in the University Auditorium.
“They made a large contribution 
to the band while they were here,” said David Waybright, UF director of bands, “and they’ve gone on to do 
great things elsewhere. They’re defi-
nitely worthy of the Hall of Fame.”
Wickes, who recently retired as 
director of bands at Louisiana State University, served as the UF director from 1973 to 1979. He said playing in the University 
Auditorium was a special opportu-nity for him because of his UF roots.
“For me it’s wonderful, it’s 
great,” he said. “My first job was 
at this auditorium. All my concerts 
were given there.”
Wickes was named Teacher of 
the Year in the College of Fine Arts in 1976, and it was in his final year at UF that he met his fellow honoree, Moorhouse, when she was just an undergraduate student.
“It’s a pretty special connection 
for us because she was my student here for one year,” he said.
Moorhouse, who also taught mu-
sic at Louisiana State University for 25 years, is now an instructor at the University of Illinois. She came to Wickes’ band as a highly regarded student of a close friend and soon made herself noticed.
Wickes remembered how, when 
Moorhouse was just a freshman, the band was having difficulty leading the flag core. He took a chance and the advice of his friend who said if it was results he wanted, it was Moor -
house he needed.
“I was leery to put a freshman in 
charge,” Wickes said, “but she took 
control over a couple of weeks and 
really made everything work.”
Moorhouse continued to serve as color guard captain until she gradu-
ated with honors from UF with a 
bachelor’s degree in music educa-tion. She went on to get her master’s in music education from LSU and her doctoral degree in instrumental conducting from the University of Washington.
Both said a lot has changed since they were in the band. 
In their time, the school of mu-
sic was only a department, and the band was half the size it is now. 
They said the school now gets a 
lot more support from Student Gov-ernment and the University Athletic Association
“That’s what you want to see when you graduate from a school,” Moorhouse said. “You want to come back and see it bigger and better.”
They both said coming to play 
with the new generation of Gators 
made them and the students proud.
“It gives the kids … a sense of 
their history ,” Wickes said, “and a 
legacy that they’re now a part of.”4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2010

AT THE POLLS
ASSOCIATED PRESS
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Gov. 
Charlie Crist’s independent bid 
for the U.S. Senate is ahead among Democrats and independents, but the former Republican is get-ting crushed among GOP voters, 
and that has left him well behind 
overall, a poll released Thursday shows.
Republican Marco Rubio com-
mands a double-digit lead among all likely voters, harnessing a split among Democrats over their nom-inee Kendrick Meek and Crist, 
according to a Quinnipiac Uni-
versity poll of 1,151 likely voters conducted between Sept. 23 and Sept. 28. It claims a margin of er -
ror of plus or minus 2.9 percent-age points.
Rubio, the former speaker of 
the state House and a tea party fa-vorite, was favored by 46 percent to Crist’s 33 percent, with Meek far back with 18 percent.
Rubio, a West Miami lawyer, 
has an 83 percent to 13 percent lead over Crist among likely Re-publican voters, the poll shows, while nearly splitting the indepen-dent vote with Crist. Meanwhile, the survey shows Crist and Meek splitting among the Democrats.
That’s a big drop for Crist, who 
had a slight lead in most polls in 
a three-way race shortly after he 
announced he was leaving the Republican Party to run as an in-dependent in April. That decision came after polls showed he would lose badly to Rubio in the Repub-lican primary. He maintained that lead through Florida’s Aug. 24 primary.
But leaving the Republicans 
has made it tougher for Crist to raise money, and he had to replace nearly all his campaign staff. Crist also doesn’t have the advantage of a party infrastructure for resourc-es like voter lists and volunteers. And the GOP is now doing every-thing in its power to defeat him — 
and so are the Democrats.
But Crist’s campaign claimed 
to be undaunted by Thursday’s 
latest poll numbers.
“This poll and 
others show that 
C o n g r e s s m a n Meek has flat-lined in the high 
teens and low 
20s following his primary,” Crist campaign spokesman Dan-
ny Kanner said. “Floridians have a real choice between Charlie Crist, an honest, independent leader or tea party darling Marco Rubio 
who is under the same clouds of 
federal investigation and insider deals that has polluted Washing-ton for too long.”
Crist has been trying to in-
crease his Democratic support by painting Meek as unelectable and himself as the only alternative to Rubio. Poll: Rubio leads

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
SAO PAULO — To understand 
why Brazilian presidential candi-
date Dilma Rousseff is so popular despite being virtually unknown a few months back, you need only 
to enter the Paraisopolis slum.
The hill-clinging shacks of its 
100,000 residents are surrounded 
by the Morumbi neighborhood, one of the richest in Latin Amer -
ica’s wealthiest city, whose man-sions and crystal blue pools are separated from the squalor by 30-foot-high, ivy-covered security 
walls and armed guards.
While such poverty abutting 
opulence is a recipe for resent-
ment, many people in Paraisopo-lis express support for the politi-cal status quo because of one man: outgoing President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and this backing has transferred to his hand-picked 
successor — the 62-year-old Rous-
seff.
“I’m with Dilma,” said Darley 
Oliveira, who runs a sparkling new bakery in Paraisopolis, when asked how he will vote in the Oct. 3 elections. “She’s Lula’s candi-date and she will continue what he has started.”
Never mind that Oliveira did 
not know who Rousseff was be-fore campaigning began in July and that she has never held an elected office.
“It’s not important. All I need 
to know is that she is Lula’s can-didate,” he said, using the nick-name the president is universally known by, as he served customers 
bread and slices of brilliantly red 
cake. “For once, we’ve had a presi-dent who really helped the poor. I am sure that Dilma will do the same.”
In an age when “change” is 
a common political battle cry around the globe, in Brazil the ma-jority just want more of the same.
Since Silva took office in 2003 
through the end of last year, 20.5 million Brazilians escaped pov-erty and 29 million entered the middle class, according to a study released this month by the private Getulio Vargas Foundation eco-nomic think tank.
Within a pool of 135 million 
voters, that is a large chunk the ruling Workers Party can reason-ably count on for support. 
Add to the mix that Brazil 
weathered the global financial crisis better than most, there has been record job growth this year and the economy is forecast to ex-pand by 7.5 percent, and it is easy 
to see why there is a desire for 
continuity.
Rousseff unquestionably rep-
resents that, as seen in her poll numbers, which put her about 25 percentage points ahead of op-position rival Jose Serra and give her a realistic chance of winning the election in the first round by 
capturing more than 50 percent of 
the vote.
Despite being relatively un-
known and lacking Silva’s charm and ability to connect to an audi-ence, Rousseff has a life story ev-ery bit as dramatic as her political mentor — whose past as a union leader standing up to the dictator -
ship is now etched into Brazilian political lore.
Rousseff was a key player in an 
armed militant group that resisted Brazil’s 1964-85 military dictator -
ship — and was imprisoned and tortured for it. 
She is a cancer survivor and 
a former minister of energy and 
chief of staff to Silva. She pos-
sesses a management style that has earned her the moniker “Iron Lady” — a name she detests.
“She is decisive, tough, smart, 
well organized and committed to strengthening her party,” said Mi-chael Shifter, president of the In-ter-American Dialogue. “She will 
essentially continue the policies 
that have been pursued by Lula, but without the happy charisma and magnetism he has.”

Today’s question: Are you registered to vote in Alachua County?Thursday’s question: Do you feel your personal information is safe?
64 TOTAL VOTES28% YES72% NOWas it Green Day who said “wake me up when 
September ends”? 
Well, that time is now. It’s already October. 
Many of you have already survived your first full month of college life complete with your first harrowing  superma-jority SG slaughter and first breakdown after you get your first 16 percent exam grade. Seriously. Sixteen. We’ve seen 
it happen. The first month is hard.  
And for the rest of us to whom September is just an-
other month of imbibing our way through our feelings and 
endless papers and exams, here’s to hoping your parents still care about you and remember you enough to still send 
you a care package!
And if not, don’t fret. The Department of Darts and 
Laurels will be here to comfort you every Friday, and to-
day just happens to be that day. 
In that spirit, we’d like to present you with our  Just-
Keep-Trucking-There’s-Only-68-More-Days-Until-The-End-Of-The-Semester-And-The-Academic-Carnage-Will-Be-Put-To-An-End…-Before-Finals edition of…. 
Darts & Laurels 
And if you ever doubted our power as we sit high atop 
our broken, faulty, squeaky newsroom chairs, just look at the weather. Just look at it. 
The lows are creeping down faster than Miley’s hemline 
at a Teen Choice Awards show. 
October is bringing with it temperatures that dip into the 
50s by Monday. 
The days of 90-degree weather and a marshy bog of arm-
pit sweat are past us.  
And you can thank us later.  Not even Mother Nature can avoid our omniscient pow-
er. After we threw that lady a big ole dart last week for be-
ing too hot and heavy, she obviously couldn’t take the heat, 
and realized we were right. 
So, weather gods and fancy, think-you-know-every-
thing meteorologists, we’re throwing you  a Never-Under -
estimate-The-Power-Of-A-Dart-To-Change-The-Course-Of-History LAUREL for kicking Heat Miser out of office for 
now.  
And there’s one other guy we’d like to throw out of  of-
fice. In the land of armadillos, cowboy hats and tumble-
weeds lives a man named Texas Gov. Rick Perry.  
This guy has been reported to jog with a loaded pistol at 
his hip. He governs the state that executes the most people, 
and he’s a living, breathing poster child for the GOP.  
And after a man at the University of Texas campus 
Tuesday shot himself in the library, maybe it’s time Second Amendment supporters like Perry realize the right to bear arms doesn’t necessarily mean in schools or in churches.  
Because when gun advocates say the way to make the 
UT campus safer is for more people to have guns, we fear for our country. Or want Texas to secede.
 So Gov. Rick  Perry, for not doing anything to make 
your state and colleges safer from those who choose to use 
the guns they legally have, we’re shooting a .22-caliber, He-
Who-Lives-By-The-Sword-Shall-Die-By-The-Sword DART  
at you.  
Completely unrelated, scientists think they’ve found a 
“Goldilocks” planet where the temperature allows for a “100 percent chance for  life.” Hey, aliens, we’re coming 
in peace and giving you a We-Already-Knew-You-Were-Here-In-Roswell LAUREL to you. And just the opposite of 
what we said last week: Gators, now is the time to break out the scarves.What is it about the words ‘‘I’m sorry” that makes it impossible to repeat them?
Humans can fly to the moon, explore deep 
sea volcanoes and make a tomato taste like a banana, but when it comes to apologizing all hope seems to be lost in uttering those simple words. 
Pride takes precedence over rationality.
Arguments are to relationships what icebergs were 
to the Titanic, and apologies are the rafts that can safely 
usher us ashore. 
But we often choose to sink and refuse the safety of 
the words “I’m sorry.”
Usually while arguing there’s a split second when 
we realize the obvious stupidity of the argument, when we realize we’re wrong, when we realize we’re hyper -
sensitive. 
Even after realizing all of this, we avoid apologizing 
almost as much as we avoid mixing beer and liquor. 
Apologies require backbone, so simply saying “I’m 
sorry” is never enough to cement forgiveness. You need to know what you want out of the apology because if 
not, you’ll end up with a lot you don’t. 
And, perhaps, that’s what makes apologizing so dif-
ficult. 
Without purpose, apologies are just empty words 
that provide no resolutions.
Sure, apologies aren’t always necessary. 
Sometimes they’re overlooked as unnecessary or ir -
relevant. 
They’re often thrown into a conversation as a sarcas-
tic attempt to mock someone. 
However, the best way to apologize is to do it sin-
cerely.I’m sure at this point I’m 
coming across like a sappy Hallmark card.
But it wasn’t until recently 
that I understood how neces-sary apologies really were. 
In typical argument pattern, 
I realized halfway through I was not only wrong but also at 
fault for the whole thing. 
So, almost instantly, I apologized, which did nothing 
to aid my case. 
Time supposedly heals all, but letting the problem 
sulk and linger is not one of my favorite things to do. 
I like handling problems when they arise. It’s like 
ripping off a Band-Aid — better done quickly. How-
ever, sometimes it’s better to wait and properly realize 
why an apology is needed because if you rush an apol-ogy you risk sounding insincere.
So I guess this is how it feels to learn a lesson. Sure, my life currently feels like a “Chicken Soup for 
the Soul” book marked with stories of guilt and forgive-ness, but at least I took the time and apologized. 
Obviously, I can’t apologize for everything I’ve ever 
done wrong; that would exceed my word limit and vari-
ous issues of this newspaper. 
But I can start with one simple apology.
So if you are reading this and you feel like I’ve done 
you wrong, which I probably have, just know one thing: I’m sorry.

Thursday column predictable, unoriginal
Do you know why I hate reading the Al-
ligator on Thursday? 
I have to see Bryan Griffin’s name on top 
the opinion section and without reading a 
word, I know I am reading a word-for-word 
excerpt from somewhere within the bowels 
of GOP .com. Bryan Griffin’s column is never 
original and never deviates from the party line. 
If the Alligator seriously cares about add-
ing new voices to the political debate and 
not about stroking the ego of Griffin, who 
thinks he is the GOP’s next great white hope, then it should seriously consider withdraw-
ing his rights to a weekly column. Or make 
him prove he isn’t a GOP automaton and is 
capable of at least one original thought.

Recent gay tragedies tell a larger story
Though the recent tragedies involving 
gay youth across the nation have made par -
ticularly notable headlines, it’s imperative to 
note these incidents happen more frequently than we’d like to admit. 
Homophobia and the pain it causes affect 
each member of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and queer communities daily. Those who have recently taken their own lives as a result of bullying or homophobic harassment — Tyler Clementi, Asher Brown, Seth Walsh, Justin Aaberg and Billy Lucas — are only the latest in a long-standing trend.
Only last year, in April of 2009, we saw headlines about the suicides of two 11-year-old boys in reaction to gay taunting. The year prior, classmates fatally shot openly gay 15-year-old Lawrence King. 
These stories shocked the country, but 
only for a week or two. Other news replaced 
their deaths. Now, we must reflect on what 
changes we’ve seen in our society in re-
sponse.
Consider this: If an American soldier 
is professed to be among the highest role 
models in our society, what does this say to 
gay children and teenagers who look up to 
them,but may never join their ranks? 
If marriage is revered as the hallmark of 
family values and tradition in the U.S., what 
hopes do we give our younger generations 
of the LGBTQ community of ever feeling like 
a part of it all? Further, what are we teaching our children about tolerance when there are people on television analogizing homosexu-
ality with bestiality? 
It should come as no surprise to us that 
children in our schools are bullying their 
gay (or presumed to be gay) peers. It should come as no surprise gay youth like Tyler Cle-
menti are committing suicide. Change must 
occur beyond constitutional amendments, 
Supreme Court rulings and anti-bullying laws. We must educate our children to do more than tolerate their peers. Acceptance 
is what we must teach. We must teach by 
example. 
Today, remember these names and those 
whose names don’t make the headlines.

Imagine a world where nothing is 
secret and everything you do on the Internet is monitored, kept 
under surveillance and stored as data. 
Remember that Skype chat you 
had last week? 
Or how about that Facebook con-
versation you had yesterday? Yes, it’s a chilling idea.
Federal law enforcement and na-
tional security officials want Con-
gress to implement new “wiretap” 
regulations that would be able to intervene and reveal concealed mes-sages.
 This order would apply to com-
munication services such as e-mail channels like Blackberry, software that allows “peer to peer” messaging like Skype and social networks such 
as Facebook.
According to Monday’s report by 
The New York Times, the govern-
ment’s reasoning is that “their abil-
ity to wiretap criminal and terrorism 
suspects is ‘going dark’ as people increasingly communicate online in-stead of by telephone.”
 The Obama administration has 
endorsed this and is planning to send in the bill to lawmakers next year.
Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Fa-
cebook refused to discuss this major 
privacy change.
“Only Facebook would comment, 
if only generally, saying in a state-ment: ‘We 
will examine any proposal 
when and if 
it material-
izes but we can’t comment on some-thing we haven’t seen. Generally, it’s 
our policy to only comply with valid, 
legal requests for data,’” the Times reported.
Trying to make Internet traffic 
function similarly to the telephone, 
the government wants to guaran-
tee access to our use of the Internet when the need arises. 
Although its intention to prevent 
another terrorist attack is favorable, this regulation  violates both our pri-vacy and free speech. This is surely not the Internet we envisioned.
It seems that when the govern-
ment grows, an individual’s priva-cy becomes less of a concern. How much is too much power for the gov-ernment? 
Does the government have our 
best interest and can they be trusted with access to our e-mail, conversa-tions and data?
We understand the government 
needs its tools to carry out its duties. 
But this does not mean that our 
privacy should be sacrificed to make law enforcement’s and national se-
curity agencies job easier.

Both teams are 30-2 since 2008
The Tide (4-0, 1-0 SEC) is much more fitting 
of the “rock star label.” 
Of the eight main statistical categories, 
Alabama ranks in the SEC’s top three for each 
one except pass defense (sixth) and is coming off an emotional win at then-No. 10 Arkansas, where the Tide erased a 13-point deficit in the 
second half.
There’s little time to recover, as ’Bama has 
to regroup and face the team that has served 
as its de-facto rival since 2008. In that time 
frame, both teams are 30-2 with an SEC title 
and national title, and they’re 1-1 head-to-head.
“This rivalry has been born out of great-
ness,” CBS analyst Gary Danielson said. “The two teams, their level of play and their excel-lence on the field has forced each other into a rivalry. They are not natural rivals. It’s be-
come the premier rivalry in college football 
because of their excellence of play over the last five years.”The Gators will hope to avoid a repeat of 
the last time they entered a game as the un-derdog. In that contest, they fell 28-24 at No. 
1 LSU in 2007.

By JESSE SIMONTON
Alligator Writer
 
After Florida’s game against 
Mississippi St. tonight at 7, fire-
works will illuminate the sky. 
While no one was looking, Jazmyne 
Avant and Nicky Kit probably pro-
vided the sparks.
The No. 6 Gators (8-1-1, 2-0 
SEC) have two of the most talented 
and versatile outside defenders in the nation. Avant and Kit are the igniters to Florida’s potent offense, despite regularly starting more than 80 yards away from goal. 
“Our whole system revolves 
around us pushing forward,” Kit said. “If we’re not going, then the offense isn’t going.”
Avant seconds that, saying, “If 
we don’t get forward, it messes up 
the whole attack.”
Under coach Becky Burleigh, 
the Gators utilize a 4-2-3-1 forma-
tion, demanding the outside full-
backs to advance up the flanks 
and create mismatches near the sidelines. In Burleigh’s system, it is crucial that her outside defenders have the skill set to become potent players within the attack. 
“If you don’t have outside backs 
that are dangerous on the attack 
then this system doesn’t work,” 
Burleigh said. 
Fortunately for Florida, Bur -leigh said, “We have two very good 
players that provide very differ -
ent, but effective things. Jazmyne’s athleticism gets her behind people all the time, and Nicky serves one 
of the most beau-
tiful balls; just one you want to finish because it’s such a sweet 
serve.”
This season, 
Avant and Kit, 
along with full-
back substitute Brooke Thigpen, have been vital to the offense, each assisting on two goals apiece, tied for second on the Gators. Kit, a se-nior, has 12 career assists and has been in the top-three on the team 
since her sophomore season. 
According to Burleigh, the di-
versity in skills between Avant 
and Kit creates matchup problems for opponents. Avant, a junior, has blazing speed, and under the tutelage of assistant coach Victor Campbell, she has learned how 
to harness that speed and use it in 
different ways to frustrate oppo-
nents. 
Using her supreme footwork, 
Kit often challenges defenders be-
fore servicing balls into the box. At least four times this season, Kit has slipped a ball through the defender’s legs to create a scoring opportunity. 
“It’s what makes our team so 
dynamic,” Kit said. “You cant de-
fend us a certain way because we 
all have different things to offer.”
Aside from their defending re-
sponsibilities, Avant and Kit have 
been involved in memorable plays this season that helped Florida win games. Avant assisted the Gators’ first goal of the season while Kit had the game-winning assist in 
overtime against Florida State. 
“Right after the game I changed 
my Facebook status to ‘a night 
you’ll never forget, with girls you’ll 
always remember,’” Kit said.

SITE: Bryant-Denny Stadium, 
Tuscaloosa, Ala., (cap. 101,821)
KICKOFF: Saturday 8 p.m.
TV/RADIO: CBS/WRUF AM850
The Red River Shootout has lost 
its luster, but that doesn’t matter to us 
here at  the alligatorSports Brand Picks Column.
Despite the loss of Colt McCoy and 
Sam Bradford we are intrigued by this matchup and don’t ask us why . With Texas coming off of a loss to UCLA, we just couldn’t pass this one up — who could? It’s pretty exciting when a Longhorns team loses by 22 points even though they held the opposition to 27 passing yards. Now that’s im-pressive.
On the other hand, Oklahoma is 
ranked in the top 10 and has yet to lose. Bradford’s replacement has already thrown for 1,221 yards this season. This beats McCoy version 2.0, Gar -
rett Gilbert, who hasn’t surpassed 900 yards yet.
To give you some more numbers, 
the two teams have split the last eight 
matchups. We are probably overselling 
the game at this point.
Besides, it isn’t like there are sexier 
matchups Saturday. Unless we are for -
getting one?
Anyway , all of these numbers have 
us confused, so we left it to two alliga-torSports writers to debate the game.
Oklahoma (-4) will cover because:
The Sooners have confused some 
people by playing down to their com-
petition. But, really , Oklahoma is just toying with bad teams because they love drama, just like Anthony Chiang.
While most people use their Face-
book statuses to quote funny movies or hardcore rappers, Anthony is all about expressing his deepest pains: “Some-
times things need to be sacrificed in the 
present in order to reap the benefits in the future,” “There will be an answer, let it be” and, of course, “Ready for an-other football Saturday.”
When talking about Oklahoma 
quarterback Landry Jones in the pre-season, Mr. Drama responded the only way he knew how: intense hatred. But 
alligatorSports.org INSIDE TEEING OFF WITH ANTHONY CHIANG HE IS PROBABLE FOR 
SATURDAY’S GAME.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer

Time is running out for Jeff 
Demps.
The injured running back re-
moved the walking boot from his sprained foot Wednesday, but on 
Thursday he was still feeling the 
effects of the injury with just two days remaining before No. 7 Flor -
ida travels to No. 1 Alabama. 
“He’s limited still,” coach Ur -
ban Meyer said Thursday. “We are going to try to practice him tomorrow more. But he is still limited.”
Demps did not wear the boot 
around campus but the junior was unable to practice at full 
speed, said Meyer, who classi-
fied the tailback as probable. If Demps cannot play in Saturday’s showdown, the Gators will rely on running backs Mike Gillislee, Emmanuel Moody and Mack Brown.
Brown, the only freshman in 
the group,has received just three 
carries this year. Playing against 
the Crimson Tide defense, which ranks fourth in the Southeastern 
Conference against the run, could 
be a rude welcoming for Brown.
“[Brown is] a freshman with 
really big, wide eyes and a nice guy that has a lot of talent, but he has to get a lot better,” Meyer said.
Debose still learning: After 
catching four passes in the first 
quarter against Kentucky, red-
shirt freshman receiver Andre Debose disappeared for the rest of the game.
Debose ran a limited number 
of routes, a result of his struggles to grasp the offense.
“We just had a small package 
for him,” wide receivers coach Zach Azzanni said. “He practiced really hard last week … so I put together a little package for him. 
Just the way the game started 
flowing, those plays didn’t get called.”
Debose built on his perfor -
mance and turned in another good week of practice, and the receiver will be “very much in-volved” this week, according to Meyer. But his understanding of 
the Gators offense is still limited. 
“He just can’t handle it right 
now,” Meyer said. “That’s not 
uncommon. It took Deonte

Mark Ingram, last year’s Heisman Trophy 
winner, and Trent Richardson, who sounds 
like a lock for the 2011 Heisman Trophy if 
you listen to those singing his praises. 
Among those supporters is UF defen-
sive end Duke Lemmens, who did his best Kanye West impression and called the duo “the best running back corps maybe in the 
history of college football.”
All this hype got me thinking about my 
favorite duos of all-time. Like Ingram and Richardson, you can’t stop them. You can 
only hope to contain them. Little man-big man 
basketball duo: Tim 
Hardaway and Alonzo 
Mourning. 
No one would argue 
they’re the best inside-outside combo of all-time, but as a South 
Florida kid, Timmy 
and Zo are my favorite. Mourning was one of 
the best centers of his generation, heroically overcame a kidney disease and was single-handedly responsible for a young Kyle 
Maistri including a “u” in the word “morn-
ing” for all of his formative years. No one had a better crossover or pull-up 3-point shot than Hardaway, who lost some of my 
support after his ignorant comments about 
gay basketball players. 
Crime Fighting Duo: Jimmy McNulty 
and Bunk Moreland
If you don’t know these two, there’s a 
five-season DVD set in my house with your 
name on it. McNulty and Bunk were the 
finest murder police Baltimore had to offer in HBO’s “The Wire” and put a much more 
real spin on the black guy-white guy buddy 
cop roles. The heavy drinking Irishman and heavy cigar smoking B-More native make 
for a supremely entertaining, witty andIt takes two: The only duos that can step with ’Bama’s pair

Jones. With his cool composure, Jones has led the No. 10 pass-ing attack in the country.
And get ready, because the Sooners quarterback is going 
to stomp on the throats of every Longhorn the way Chiang 
stomps on rivals of his gang, the “Bone Thug Bosses.”
— TYLER JETT
Texas will stay within at least a field goal because:
You don’t mess with Texas, Tyler Jett. There is no way the 
Longhorns don’t cover in this game. Texas isn’t the only squad that had a minor hiccup along the way , Oklahoma saw a scare 
last week and pulled out a two-point win against Cincy. 
The fact that it’s a rivalry game will keep it a close contest 
and MackBrown is not going to lose two in a row. But forgive 
Tyler, he has a man crush on Landry Jones. He is still heart-broken over Jones’ decision to shave of that mustache of his. Tyler likes those.
— ANTHONY CHIANG
Now on to the picks!Alone in first with a 25-13 record is alligatorSports Assis-
tant Editor Tyler “I just get caught up” Jett, who gets so caught up in his writing that he forgets to show up to prior commit-ments. And by commitments, I mean anything except listen-
ing to 50 Tyson.
Coming in second with a 22-16 record is Alligator football 
writer Mike “I have a vagina on my knee” McCall, whose up-
per shin now features a deep, gaping hole. When we said, “Grow a pair,” we didn’t mean it like that, Mike.
In a three-way tie for third with a 21-17 record is The 
Gainesville Sun’s Edward “I’m simply the best when it comes to surprises and gifting” Aschoff, whose only skill greater than lavishing his girlfriend on terrific lady day is telling everyone else how awesome he is at lavishing his girlfriend on terrific lady day . Stop raising the bar at letting everyone know you raised the bar, Edward.
Alongside Edward is Alligator football writer Kyle “Now 
I know what Mark Ingram feels like against defensive backs” Maistri, whose car collided with a poor, innocent bike rider last week. We know, it was his fault. (“It was dark! Why wasn’t he wearing a fluorescent shirt?”) But you didn’t need to stand over him, letting him know who runs NE 5th Street.
Also in third is Keith “That’s what you get when you wait 
until the last minute to study” Neibuhr, who accosted one of the student journalists for not properly respecting his academ-ic endeavors. The word “student” comes before “journalist.” 
We get it, dad.
In a pillow fight for sixth with a 19-19 record is alligator -
Sports Editor Anthony “That’s way too American for me” 
Chiang, who is apprehensive about our road trip to ‘Bama due to his intense hatred of barbecue. Well, kiss your North Cuban Castro Cuisine goodbye, Chiang, and say hello to ribs, banana pudding and white bread.
Tied with Chiang is FightinGators.com’s Cody “Which 
character from ‘The League’ am I going to turn out like?” 
Jones, who spends about five hours a week coaching one of 
five fantasy football teams. You seem like a Taco to us, Cody . We can totally see you performing a song about accidental conception in front of a group of young children.
And in dead-ass last place with a piss-poor record of 18-20 
is the Miami Herald’s Joe “Sweet home Alabama” Goodman, who is heading back to his native land, where they respect people with big belt buckles and the smell of hot dog water is always in the air. We heard the state will be busting out its finest fire hoses  for your glorious return, Joe.16, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, OCTOBER 1, 2010

in fictional police depart-
ments. 
Rap Duo: Mos Def and 
Talib Kweli
The two emcees teamed 
up as “Black Star” for one in-
credible album that is still in 
heavy rotation on my iPod 12 
years later. Think Gucci Mane and OJ Da Juiceman, but 
with talent and not as yellow. 
Smooth flows, thought-pro-voking lyrics and social con-
sciousness define Mos and 
Kweli, who leaned on friend and steady producer Hi-Tek 
to provide the beats. The two 
really are “the best alliance in hip-hop.”
Wide Receiver Duo: Ran-
dy Moss and Wes WelkerYes, I’m a Dolphins fan. 
And yes, I’m supposed to hate the Patriots. But Moss and Welker represent every-
thing a white sports fan such 
as myself loves to watch in a receiver combo. Moss is the 
freakishly athletic black guy, 
who I could never be like in my wildest dreams. Moss 
is so dominant in his physi-
cal prowess that a term for jumping over a defender and 
planting one’s nether regions 
near said defender’s face was named after him and has be-
come commonly used in the 
everyday sports lexicon -- get-ting “Mossed,” or “Mossing” 
someone. Meanwhile, Welker 
is the great white hope. A shifty little white guy who 
never quits, takes big hits over 
the middle, fights for extra yards and plays a position not 
usually associated with little 
white guys in the first place. 
SportsCenter Duo: Rich 
Eisen and Stuart Scott
Long before Eisen moved 
to the NFL Network and Scott 
became something of a run-
ning joke, the two were the best in the business. Anchor -
ing a show I watched every day growing up, Eisen and Scott played off each other 
perfectly, coming across as 
knowing everything about sports while still providing 
laughs for the viewers. As an 
added bonus, they fell into the black guy-white guy dy-
namic that unintentionally 
dominates my list. Eisen’s “He busts out the whuppin 
stick,” and Scott’s “Boo Yah!” 
will stick with me forever.KYLE , from page 15
[Thompson] a while.”
Practices Improving: Some-
times even practices could be 
tough for a young team.
That was the case for the Gators 
to begin the season, but Meyer is starting to see improvements in his team’s practice habits.
“I think we are over the hump 
now of teaching guys how to prac-tice, thank God,” he said. “That 
was a learning curve for a while.”Part of the challenge this week 
was the crowd noise. Coaches 
piped in the Alabama fight song, along with Lynyrd Skynyrd’s 
“Sweet Home Ala-bama” to prepare the team for Satur -
day’s game.
“The defense I 
thought was very good,” Meyer said. 
“The offense just wanted to turn around and knock one of those speakers out.”UF plays ‘Sweet Home   
Alabama’ in practice
