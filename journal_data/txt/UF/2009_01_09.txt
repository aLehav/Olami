MIAMI – Titletown is alive and well again.
It just took a little longer to realize this 
time.
This one was a far cry from the blowout 
two years again in Glendale, but the fireworks and confetti were just as sweet for the Gators.
Brandon Spikes knows that Gainesville 
now contains the best football program in America.
“If ya’ll want us,” Spikes said, “You gotta 
come get us.”
Oklahoma will be left wondering, yet again, 
about its struggles in BCS contests as it lost its fifth straight BCS game and third straight na-tional championship game Thursday night in Dolphin Stadium.
At the same time, Urban Meyer became 
the first coach to win two BCS national cham-pionships.
“It feels great,” Meyer said. “It is hum-
bling when you consider all the great coaches and players who have and op-portunity to do it. It only shows the pro-fessional way that our coaches and play-ers prepare every week.”
And a year after the Gators’ defense 
was embarrassed by Michigan in the 
Capital One Bowl, it had its sweet re-
venge in front of 78,468 fans, the largest crowd ever for a football game at Dolphin Stadium.
While the majority of the defense 
is made up of the same players 
from a year ago, linebacker Ryan Stamper said the unit has come 
miles from the young squad that 
gave up 41 points to Michigan in 
last year’s Capital One Bowl.
UF held Oklahoma to a 
season-low in points, and the 
Gators won 24-14, clinching 
their second national champi-
onship in three seasons.
This was a Sooners offense 
that had scored a NCAA-record 
702 points this season and came 
into Thursday scoring 60 points in five straight games.
“In the offseason, we told our defense if 
they got stops this year, we would win a na-tional championship,” wide receiver Percy Harvin said. “We’re No. 1 now.”
This was a game where UF quarterback 
Tim Tebow wasn’t at his best, at least early on. The Offensive MVP ended the game 18-of-30passing for 231 yards, with two touchdowns and two interceptions. He added 109 yards on 22 carries on the ground. He told his team-mates at halftime when the score was tied at 7 that they were going to pull it out, according to safety Major Wright.
“Tebow’s a man of his word,” Wright said. VOLUME 102 ISSUE 78 FRIDAY, JANUARY 9, 2009

over the past two years because Florida’s economic decline has been faster and deeper than ex-pected due to the national reces-sion and financial meltdown.
The House wants to take $235 
million out of the state’s transpor -
tation trust fund and use that mon-ey to offset shortfalls in the general fund, which covers most opera-tional spending including schools, courts and social services.
The Senate plan leaves the fund 
untouched in hopes that spending on roads, airports and other trans-
portation construction and mainte-
nance will help stimulate Florida’s sagging economy.
“Every one dollar invested in 
the (highway) work program yields $5.60 of economic benefit, creating jobs,” said Sen. Mike Fasano, a New Port Richey Republican who chairs a panel that oversees trans-
portation spending.
By voice vote, the Senate Ways 
and Means Committee rejected 
a proposal to shift $123 billion in transportation money to eliminate a 4 percent cut to state universi-ties and community colleges. The funds are currently earmarked for increasing the capacity of roads 
and other transportation facilities.
“In this economic environment 
it is the capacity of our university 
system and our community col-leges that we should be increas-ing,” said Sen. Ted Deutch, D-Boca Raton.
Both chambers would borrow 
money from the Lawton Chiles 
Endowment, which invests money 
from the state’s multibillion-dollar tobacco settlement for future spending on health care programs for children and the elderly.
The House plan would take 
$400 million from the fund, named for the late governor, while the Senate’s package would remove 
$700 million. Both would delay the 
loan until June.
By then the economy may 
improve and the state could get federal stimulus money to re-place some or all the tobacco fund borrowing, said Rep. Marcelo Llorente, a Miami Republican who chairs a House panel overseeing general government and health care spending.
Each plan would raid the state’s 
affordable housing trust fund but would take differing amounts. The Senate would remove $140 million compared to $283 million under the House plan.
Both packages would require 
pay cuts for school employees in financially troubled districts.slammed a door on the hand of a 15-year-old student who was trying to get into a classroom to take photographs for the school yearbook. Officials also say she grabbed another student by the arm and pushed him into a wall

held from her record if she com-pletes the terms of the sentence, which include 16 hours of com-munity service, anger manage-ment counseling and no contact with either victim.
Casey Anthony won’t be 
deposed from jail
ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — The 
Florida mother charged with 
murdering her daughter will not be deposed from jail in a defama-tion lawsuit.
An Orlando judge ruled 
Thursday that Casey Anthony can answer written questions from jail rather than face a vid-eotaped deposition behind bars. The defamation lawsuit was filed by Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez. She says she was defamed by Casey Anthony when the moth-
er told police in July that a nanny 
named Zenaida Gonzalez had kidnapped her daughter, Caylee.
Caylee was 2 years old when 
she went missing in June, but her remains were not found until last month. She had been missing for about a month before her mother reported it.
Fla. lawmakers split on 
cutting road spending
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) 
— Florida lawmakers were split 
Thursday over spending cuts and fund shifts to resolve a bud-get deficit of at least $2.3 billion.
Although the House and 
Senate were fairly close on cut-ting nearly $1 billion in spending and raising traffic fines, two main questions divided them: whether to cut spending for road building and other transportation projects and how much money to borrow from the state’s tobacco settle-
ment endowment.
The two chambers are expect-
ed to vote Friday on their deficit-
elimination plans. They will then try to resolve differences before taking final action next week.
“It hurts me to even have to 
say ‘yes’ to this budget,” said Sen. Evelyn Lynn, R-Ormond 
Beach. “The best we can do at 
this time is to get this horrible task over with.”
Overall, the Senate plan 
would offset only the current $2.3 billion deficit projection. The House package, though, has a cushion of $534 billion in case revenue again falls short of fore-
casts before the end of the budget 
year on June 30.

Travoltas hold memorial
for son in N. Florida
OCALA, Fla. (AP) — Friends 
and relatives of John Travolta and 
his wife Kelly Preston gathered Thursday at their central Florida home for a memorial service to 
honor their late son, Jett.
The couple lives in a sprawling 
$8 million home in a luxury sub-
division with its own airstrip near this small town. Jett, 16, died at the family vacation home in Grand Bahama last week.
More than a dozen reporters 
and photographers gathered out-
side the Jumbolair Aviation Estates 
subdivision hours before the after -
noon event.
A steady stream of catering 
trucks and florists entered the com-plex Thursday . A handful of locals also stopped by out of curiosity or carried bouquets of flowers and handed them to guards at the sub-division’s main gate.
“I wanted to help John celebrate 
his son’s life and not necessarily his death,” said 52-year-old Sherie Maud of Ocala, who brought a dozen red roses.
The service for Jett was to ad-
here to the tenets of the actor’s faith, Scientology, and celebrate the teen’s life.
The Travoltas have spoken 
publicly only once since their son 
died. “We are heartbroken that our 
time with him was so brief. We will cherish the time we had with him for the rest of our lives,” they said in a statement Sunday.
Evaluation ordered for teen 
charged in shooting
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. 
(AP) — A Broward County judge 
has ruled that a teenager charged with fatally shooting a friend at a South Florida high school will soon 
undergo a psychiatric evaluation.
However, Judge John Murphy 
on Thursday declined to transfer 
Teah Wimberly from the North Broward Jail in Pompano Beach to a psychiatric hospital.
Wimberly, 15, could be sen-
tenced to a maximum of life in prison if she is convicted of sec-
ond-degree murder in the death of 
Amanda Collette. She will be tried as an adult.
Authorities say Wimberly and 
Collette were longtime friends who had recently stopped speak-ing before the November shooting at Dillard High School.
Wimberly pleaded not guilty.

The game was in Miami, but you 
wouldn’t know it from the noise at 
the Stephen C. O’Connell Center dur -
ing the BCS National Championship Game Thursday night.
10,300 pairs of arms and legs 
chomped and stomped in the stands of the O’Dome as fans watched the Gators snag their second title in three years on four jumbo screens in the corners of the stadium.
Fans sprung from their seats 
in unison after the Gators drew first blood against the Oklahoma 
Sooners in the first quarter and 
stayed on their feet through much of the night.
After each touchdown, fans hol-
lered, hopped around and high-fived.
They wore orange and blue 
shirts, wigs, hats, jerseys, beads, scarves, plastic Hawaiian leis, and 
face paint while a small  group of cheerleaders and pep band mem-
bers tried to add to the energy of the already pumped-up crowd.
There was a brief period of panic 
around 10:45 p.m. when the video feed cut out and a rotating Gator logo replaced the game.
After what seemed like hours but 
was only a minute or two, a relieved crowd cheered  when the image was restored.
Across campus in the Orange & 
Brew, the crowd held their collec-tive breath and clasped their hands in prayer as the Sooners approached the Gator goal-line at the end of the first half. The  intoxicated crowd 
screamed and pounded the tables 
after the Gators denied the Sooners end-zone entry.
Amid the sea of orange and blue, 
a lonely Oklahoma fan shook his head. He declined to comment when asked for his reaction to the game.
Meanwhile, Shannon Corwin, 
a UF mathematics junior, said the 
Gators were going to win because 
it was her birthday. “They won last time on my birthday too,” she said with an empty Blue Moon sitting on the table in front of her. “I’m good luck.”
Her friend Kate O’Neal, an edu-
cation senior, thought the Gators would win for a different reason.
“I’m wearing my lucky under -
wear,” she said.
The atmosphere off campus was 
equally spirited.
 On the sidewalk outside of 
Tijuana Flats, a football fan in an al-ligator skull-topped UF cap greeted 
passers-by, telling them how great is 
to be a Florida Gator. 
Midtown bars and restaurants 
filled with fans but were noticeably emptier than the 2007 champion-ship, said 23-year-old Christopher Cedros, a bouncer at The Swamp Restaurant.
“This is a little more mellow than 
last time,” he said, as he checked IDs at the restaurant’s entrance.
On the restaurant’s outdoor pa-
tio, the mood was more animated than mellow.
Fans knocked down pitchers of 
beer and plates of hamburgers and fries, as three big-screen TVs played ESPN highlight reels of UF and Oklahoma’s football seasons.
Inside the restaurant, people 
clanked orange and blue hand-clap-pers to the beat of the song “Chicken Fried” by The Zach Brown Band. 
Fans cheered the Gators’ daz-
zling offensive drives and defensive stops but jeered referee calls in favor of Oklahoma.
The whistle for halftime snapped 
them out of their football frenzy , as fans took rest room breaks and ice cream seekers rushed to Ben & Jerry’s during halftime.
Ben & Jerry scoopers Shannon 
May , 20, and Brittany Isom, 18, were ready for the onslaught of custom-ers. Staff made extra waffle cones and cookies to prepare for the night, May said.
May , a junior marketing major 
from Clearwater, was a little disap-pointed about working during the game. 
“I tried hard to give my shift 
away,” she said.
As soon as the clock ran out, 
fans poured out of the O’Dome and rushed University Avenue in Gator Championship tradition. 
Chants of “It’s great to be a 
Florida Gator” and “Orange” and “Blue” filled the night. Streams of toilet paper sailed over the crowd and people stood on top of cross-
walk signals. Across the street, a 
shirtless fan did pull-ups from the top of a street pole.
“I’m having the best time of my 
life,” said Ely Mercil, a fan who climbed a greased light pole.
His hands and arms were cov-
ered with the PAM cooking spray authorities applied to poles before 
the game to discourage climbing.
“We destroyed Okalahoma. We 
own this shit,” he yelled.
Lucky underwear, birthdays determine final score
“They won last time 
on my birthday too.                    
I’m good luck.”

Partial coverage breeds U.S. apathy
As the battle between Israeli and Hamas fighters in Gaza stretches into its second week, not enough Americans are speaking up against the outrageous 
destruction of innocent lives.
Wars are covered in terms of numbers: casualties, rock-
ets fired, troops sent in. Now that the death toll in Gaza has topped 700 people — at least 40 percent of whom are women and children — what does that mean to the American people?
The answer is not enough.What we don’t see paints a horrific image of people suf-
fering with no place to go.
Children are arriving at hospitals in Gaza where doc-
tors do not have the resources required to give them the treatment they need, and hospital morgues are filled to the brim, with more corpses arriving each day. Whole fami-lies, simply by being in the wrong place at the wrong time, have been killed in an instant.
To Americans, this war simply isn’t terrible enough 
for us to care. Yes, it is sad. And yes, it is a shame. But Americans just do not get the full picture of the human cost of the war. As a nation, we are not outraged nearly enough by the wanton killing of civilians currently taking place.
Thousands of miles away, the crisis in Gaza seems alien 
and foreign. However, this is no excuse. Regardless of how far removed the civilians stuck in a battle zone are, there is no reason to accept their deaths as nothing more than a necessary cost of war.
Average Americans are protected from the gruesome 
images of foreign wars with light, fluffy “news.” On the day that rockets were fired into Israel from southern Lebanon, one of the top news stories on CNN’s Web site was about “cute things falling asleep.”Should the news outlets, 
driven by advertising revenue, be blamed for simply pander -
ing to their audiences?
In a word, yes.Supposedly, there was a 
time when journalists had a duty to inform people even if what they were telling them was not what people wanted to see. Somewhere down the road, 
however, things changed, and they stopped showing us scenes that might be too graphic for our taste.
Is it because the country has been involved in some 
form of war since 2001 that the concept of war has lost its zing? Is war just not sexy enough for the news to cover anymore? Or is it simply a case of viewers being fatigued by coverage of wars?
Regardless of why it is occurring, we cannot accept 
these partial stories and allow this to carry on, for as long as we do, we are doing a huge disservice to the people of Gaza.
Both Hamas and Israel need to stop hitting civilians 
immediately, but they are not the only ones to blame for these merciless killings. Each moment we let pass without speaking up and demanding that the leaders of the world work together to stop the violence, we are silently allow-ing these acts to continue.
It is time for Americans to stop hiding behind the 
shield of the news outlets and see for themselves what lies beyond their television sets. The people caught in the crossfire don’t have time for us to ignore the big picture anymore.
Naudia Jawad is a journalism graduate student.It’s that time of year again. Quickly becoming as common-place as luminaries like Homecoming and spring break in Cancun, it’s the unofficial kickoff to the spring semes-
ter — UF finding itself in the BCS National Championship 
Game.
With this seemingly annual celebration of UF’s football 
awesomeness comes trips to locales such as Phoenix and 
Miami, an extended drop/add period, and no class the day 
after the big game.
Oh wait – well, let’s move on to the BCS/we-know-you-
missed-it-oh-so-much edition of this semester’s...
Darts & Laurels
What should have been a week full of smiles and school-
girl giggling over the possibility of a second football cham-pionship in three years sadly found itself upended by the unscrupulous actions of our “beloved” president.
With his first DART of the new semester (insert shock 
here), President Bernie Machen is on a record-setting pace 
to reach epic levels of infamy on the pages of the Alligator in 2009. Early Vegas-line figures show Machen as an odds-on favorite to take home the crown as the most heavily darted individual of the new year.
Refusing to accommodate UF students while our football 
team battles for gridiron glory really strikes a chord with the Editorial Board. Homecoming gets a three-day weekend just so Fratty McFrat and Suzie Sorority can chug oversized quantities of jungle juice to the point of inebriation? Come on, Bernie, you have to admit you really stuck it to us on the fourth day of school.  
Hmm, we wonder where the UF higher-ups will be at 8:30 
on Friday morning? Fat chance we find them wide-eyed and cheery at another one of those, yawn, symposiums they just love to attend.
On a much brighter note, the Editorial Board would like 
to give the entire UF football team a goddamn-you-guys-
are-good LAUREL for their accomplishments this season. 
Urban Meyer’s tenure in Gainesville has seen unparalleled success for the program — giving us even more to brag about to our lowly friends from high school who have the unfortu-nate luck of attending Florida State.  
Win or lose, we will not soon forget a highlight-reel season, 
from Superman, err, Tim Tebow’s heartfelt press conference to a gutsy fourth-quarter comeback against then top-ranked 
Alabama — sans superstar wide receiver/every-position-
imaginable Percy Harvin.
Back to the harsh realities that not everything can be as 
great as UF football, the Editorial Board frowns upon anyone 
who exploits the not-so-deep pockets of the Gator Nation, 
especially given the current economic climate.  
We’re looking at you, West University Avenue bars — 
guilty for jacking up the price of booze knowing damn well 
that hordes of UF students far more concerned about aca-demics than football would be staying in town to catch the 
game. Here’s a come-on-did-you-really-have-to DART for 
taking our business 364 other days of the year for granted 
and making a night out in Gainesville really feel like Miami for us — minus that whole charm and ambiance thing. 
Hardly a shock if you’ve been keeping score at home — 
but the Editorial Board would like to present this week’s final 
award to a former dart gone good. For his attempts to show 
Congress that bleeding blue and orange trumps all politi-cal obligation, we award Rep. Cliff Stearns a well-deserved 
LAUREL as a consolation prize for being stuck watching the game amid the undereducated wannabe sports fans who roam the streets of D.C.
That’s all for this week. Win or lose – have a safe week-

Speaking Out
Defense no excuse for attacks
Apparently, Spenser Solis 
doesn’t value every human life 
with his attempt to justify the col-lective, disproportional punish-ment of Gaza as part of Israel’s defense when Israel, along with the United States, is one of the few countries to still maintain with a straight face that blatantly offen-sive attacks are indeed defensive.
While I would prefer Hamas 
not to be in power in Gaza, the fact remains that Israel and the United States, who weren’t too keen on the ruling Fatah party at the time, practically forced elections on the Palestinians, didn’t like the results and then collectively punished them through starvation. 
Now, after it provoked them, it’s 
quite obvious that the government of Israel was only looking for an excuse to go back in and show the Palestinians who’s boss — turning to tactics the likes of which orga-nizations such as the Red Cross and Amnesty International have openly condemned.

How would you like it if all the mon-
ey you could have saved on your car insurance was a bundle of cash 
that constantly watched you with an ever-so-slight smile, your own personal green 
bundle of buyer’s regret?
In the typical far-fetched style of Geico’s 
advertising — a caveman ordering gourmet 
food at a restaurant, a talking gecko with a Cockney accent — this is exactly the sce-nario explored in their newest ad campaign, recently launched in December. And that very bundle of money, named Kash, is the latest and greenest mascot to join the likes 
of the gecko, the caveman and the various 
other faces of Geico ads that have amused and entertained us for years.
Yet unlike the concept of the beloved 
Geico gecko, which is based on a somewhat clever wordplay, the concept of Kash does not even make an attempt at wit. Kash is just a wad of, well, cash, with two googly eyes that stare mutely at potential Geico custom-
ers like the Ghost of Christmas Past, an ee-
rie reminder of the savings that could have been if they had only switched to Geico.
In one of the released commercials fea-
turing Geico’s new star, a woman giggles inanely at Kash while she’s on a date with someone else, flirting more with the silent bundle than her actual date. When the wait-er tells her that Kash is the money she would 
have saved with Geico, the woman replies, 
“I know,” with an expression of regret that 
is just as vacuous as her giggle. Then a shot 
of Kash staring at the camera is accompa-nied by a remake of Rockwell’s 1984 hit “Somebody’s Watching Me,” a song whose lyrics 
describe the fear of being watched by enti-ties such as the neighbors, the mailman and even the IRS — in short, consumer paranoia at its finest.
The idea behind the commercial is the 
Geico premise in its most uncomplicated form: Kash, literally the $500 that Geico al-legedly saves its customers, “watches” all the suckers who haven’t been savvy enough 
to jump on the Geico bandwagon. 
So what’s the problem with launching an 
ad campaign that is so elementary it practi-
cally insults one’s intelligence? 
Well, it is certainly not anything we 
would have seen coming — especially since it poses such a stark contrast to the earlier Geico caveman concept, an ad campaign so wildly successful it even snagged its own 
ABC spin-off “Cavemen” in 2007. Those ads 
featured cavemen who were well-spoken, social and intelligent beings, participating in enough tennis and therapy to rival any self-respecting WASP . 
When confronted by the new Geico slo-
gan, “Geico: So easy a caveman could do it,” they were insulted and outraged because they were actually more moneyed and cul-
tured than most modern-day people. The 
concept was absurd enough to be hilarious.
Yet in this new Geico commercial, the 
woman flirting with Kash is neither bizarrely intellectual nor proud of her circumstances; rather, she comes off as inconsiderate, irre-sponsible and, frankly, stupid. She is aware that she is potentially losing money by not switching to Geico, but all she can do about 
it is flirt with the wad of cash like some air-
headed gold digger trying to strike it big. Instead of making cavemen seem smarter than they should be, this new ad bafflingly makes people seem more stupid than they should be. 
Is choosing Geico so easy that a human 
can’t even manage to do it?
It may be true that we Americans do not 
always use our higher brain functions, and that we have not always been smart about money — mistakes that we are now paying for in full.
Yet it is also grossly unfair to assume that 
we have completely lost our taste for appre-ciating a bit of ingenuity in the advertise-ments that are thrown at us daily. 
We are not mindless drones with dol-
lar signs rattling around in our otherwise empty skulls. The human brain just hap-pens to be the most sophisticated one on the planet, which certainly affords us the ability to value even the least bit of sophistication in return.
Hey, Geico: Stop being lazy — and for 
God’s sake, come up with something that shows at least one iota of thought behind 
it before expecting us to trust you with our 
money.

 THE GROUP WILL MEET AGAIN ON 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON.
Jews and Palestinians came together 
Thursday afternoon to protest the conflict 
in the Gaza Strip.
Led by Scott Camil, coordinator for the Gainesville chapter of Veterans for Peace, protesters stood at the corner of University Avenue and 13th Street holding signs pro-testing the violence in the Middle East.
“I am a Jewish person,” Camil said. “It’s 
really important for Jews and Palestinians to work together and do what we can to raise awareness and set an example.”Violence is not an acceptable means of 
conflict resolution, he said.
Camil said that because 
$3.5 billion in U.S. tax money 
goes to Israel each year in the 
form of weapons, it makes the 
conflict American citizens’ business. 
“I have been to the Gaza Strip, and the living conditions there are unacceptable,” Camil said. “[Conditions] are not good  enough for my family, and if they are not good enough for my family, they are not 
good enough for any family.”
The protesters will meet again Friday 
afternoon.

Three middle school students 
were arrested this week in con-
nection with the sexual battery of 
one of their classmates.
On Dec. 15 at Kanapaha Middle 
School, two 14-year-old males 
were accused of restraining and 
sexually assaulting a 13-year-old 
female when the teacher stepped out of the classroom. A 13-year-old male was also arrested for threatening to harm students who cooperated with the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office investiga-
tion, said Steve Maynard, ASO 
spokesman.
The four students are mentally 
disabled.
According to the ASO arrest 
report, one of the male students rubbed the girl’s legs and the oth-er put his hand under her skirt.
The two male students then 
pushed her on the couch and held her down while one sexu-ally assaulted her, according to the report.
The school reported the inci-
dent to ASO the following day.“The ASO Special Victims Unit 
has undergone special training to be able to speak with children,” Maynard said. 
After the ASO Special Victims 
Unit spoke to the girl who was reportedly assaulted and stu-dents who were in the room, of-ficials decided they had probable 
cause to arrest the two students, 
Maynard said.
One 14-year-old male stu-
dent was arrested Monday and 
charged with sexual battery and false imprisonment, and another 
14-year-old male student was ar -
rested Tuesday and charged with false imprisonment. 
The school board is investigat-
ing the portion of the crime that deals with the teacher leaving the classroom unattended, Maynard said.
Because all involved students 
are mentally disabled, he said it is up to the court to decide if the students knew they were com-
mitting a crime.Middle schoolers arrested for assaulting classmate

 THE STATE EARNED AN F 
IN SCHOOL SPENDING.
By MATTHEW BEATON
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Florida education system 
tied with Vermont for 10th place in 
overall education quality, accord-
ing to Education Week’s Quality 
Counts 2009 report.
Florida’s overall grade for 2009 
was a 79.6, or a C-plus, which is an improvement over its score in 2008. Since 2007, the state jumped in ranking from No. 31 to No. 10. 
The overall grade was derived 
from individual grades each state 
received in six separate fields. 
These fields included chance-for-success, K-12 achievement, finance, standards, transition and alignment and the teaching pro-fession. 
In each of these categories, the 
state earned a C-minus or better. 
The state earned a 90.8 (A) in 
the standards, assessment and ac-countability category. The one sore spot is the 51.7 (F) Florida earned in  spending, a sub-category of school finance.
The high marks were a wel-
comed opportunity for Tallahassee to laud the efficacy of its education system.
“We’ve been improving in all 
areas,” said Tom Butler, press sec-retary for the Florida Department of Education. “Florida is mak-ing improvements and building a foundation from the earliest 
grades on up… and I think we are 
seeing the fruits of that process.”
Local parents agreed with the 
study’s ratings, and some even believed that their children’s edu-cation was superior to the study’s findings.
“My child, personally , I think 
is getting a better education [than 
the study indicates],” said Holly 
Nelson, whose daughter attends Fort Clarke Middle School. “I think that [the school] is doing a great job.”
Some local school adminis-
trators criticized the lack of state funds and agree that Florida de-serves an F in spending. The grade is only slightly lower than the na-tional average of 67.
Florida also earned an F in 
Spending in last year’s study , and local school administrators are concerned that a proposed 2 per -
cent across-the-board cut on edu-cation spending will exacerbate the situation. The Florida House of Representatives is considering the proposal.
“[The state of Florida] is trying 
to run social services and educa-tion off a 6 percent sales tax. It’s absurd,” said Don Lewis, princi-
pal of Abraham Lincoln Middle 
School. “[Florida’s rating] would be higher if the appropriate fund-ing would come in like it should.”
Florida’s teachers and adminis-
trators have been forced to pick up the slack, Lewis said. 
He credited Florida’s high 
grade to the quality and resilience 
of Florida teachers and adminis-
trators. 
“Considering the lack of fund-
ing, it’s remarkable to me that you have educators who continue to do and serve so well,” Lewis said. “[Our teachers] are so well prepared…I don’t know how we retain them.”Florida earns 10th

The items that sit inside glass cases 
tell Cuba’s story – a map of the island 
nation from 1606, a book of poetry from a slave who would become a famous intellectual, and even photos 
of a future UF professor who joined 
Fidel Castro’s revolution. 
These and other rare items can be 
seen today until Jan. 23 in the CUBA: Past, Present and Future Exhibit 
of Rarities display at the Smathers 
Library. 
“These materials have never 
been exhibited before,” said Richard 
Phillips, head of the Latin American 
Collection at UF. “We’re very excit-ed.”  
The exhibit, open from 9 a.m. to  6 
p.m. Monday through Thursday and 
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Friday, consists of 
rare books, maps, photographs and other items spanning more than 200 years of Cuban history and culture.  
A signed book of poetry by Cuban 
national hero Jose Marti sits in one case, while another display contains insurance policies expressing the de-humanization of slaves in the early colonial days of the Caribbean is-lands.  
The exhibit, which has been in the 
making since October, consists of pri-vate donations along with items from UF libraries and other departments, Phillips said.  
The athletic department donated a 
trophy from a 1926 track meet between UF and a university in Havana. Another 
UF library donated a 1929 letter from the President of Cuba to UF President John Tigert expressing the desire for closer relations and exchanges with 
the university. 
Phillips said UF has one of the top 
collections pertaining to the post-
1950s Caribbean and Latin America. 
The exhibit debuts today on the 
second floor of Smathers Library.
On Sunday, there will be an open-
ing reception at the exhibit from 4 to 7 p.m. to mark the 50th anniversary 
of the Cuban Revolution and Castro’s 
rule.Cuba exhibit debutsINTERNATIONAL
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — A key panel 
unanimously recommended impeachment 
for Gov. Rod Blagojevich on Thursday, set-
ting up a vote that could make him the first governor to face such fate in Illinois’ sordid 
political history.
Blagojevich should lose his job for abus-
ing power, mismanaging government and committing possible criminal acts, includ-
ing federal allegations he tried to sell off a U.S. Senate seat, the special committee con-
cluded.
The governor’s office issued a statement 
calling the panel’s proceedings flawed and biased.
The full House could vote as early as 
Friday morning. A vote for impeachment would trigger a Senate trial to decide 
whether the second-term Democrat should be removed from office.
Many on the 21-member special commit-
tee called it a sad day for Illinois, but Rep. Bill Black disagreed.
“I think this is a good, glad, happy day 
for Illinois because it points out that nobody is above the law,” said Black, a Republican. 
“There have been egregious abuses if half of 
what we read is true.”
Blagojevich denies any wrongdoing and 
his office’s statement called the panel’s vote a “foregone conclusion” resulting from pro-ceedings where his team was “never given the chance to put on any kind of defense.”
The statement also assumes the full 
House will vote to impeach.
“When the case moves to the Senate, an 
actual judge will preside over the hearings, 
and the Governor believes the outcome will 
be much different,” it reads.
Spokesman Lucio Guerrero said earlier 
there was no chance Blagojevich would resign before the full House decision. Blagojevich’s attorneys left the hearing be-
fore the committee voted.
The committee’s report 
said that the citizens of Illinois “must have confi-
dence that their governor will faithfully serve the 
people and put their in-
terests before his own. It is with profound regret that 
the committee finds that 
our current governor has not done so.”
Blagojevich was arrested Dec. 9 on fed-
eral charges that include allegations he 
schemed to profit from his power to name President-elect Barack Obama’s replace-
ment in the Senate.
He later appointed Roland Burris to 
fill the Senate seat, and Burris testified Thursday that he did not make a deal with 
the governor to win the plum position.
“There was nothing .... legal, personal, or 
political exchanged for my appointment to this seat,” Burris testified under oath.Panel wants impeachment

Doris saw the picture of the palm 
tree and knew. She liked the mixture 
of greens, yellows and oranges. 
But her pre-painting warm-up 
was different than most.
Rather than mixing colors on a 
palette or envisioning her artwork on a blank canvas, she sang “Take Me Out to the Ball Game.”
Doris participated in a program 
called Art Without Boundaries, which uses a combination of sing-ing, painting and movement as a form of therapy .  
This therapy , called 
MnemeTherapy — whole brain therapy — helps people with Alzheimer’s disease, autism and learning disabilities.  
“The art shows the triumph of the 
human spirit, and we’re here to sup-port that triumph,” said artist and founder of Art Without Boundaries 
Noell Hammer.
More than 20 clients from Al’z Place, a local center for Alzheimer’s 
patients, will have one-on-one 30-minute sessions with Hammer on Thursday and Friday to create their own works of art.
During the sessions, clients 
choose a piece of artwork Hammer has painted and recreate it. 
Executive director of ElderCare 
of Alachua County Anthony Clarizio said artwork the clients produce will be sold at a silent auction on Jan. 31. 
The money raised at the auction 
will serve as a fundraiser for the cli-ents of Al’z Place. 
“This is not kindergarten art,” 
Hammer said. “These are actually things you’d put on a wall and en-
joy.”
Hammer started Art Without 
Boundaries nine years ago in South Florida, but now the program and 
therapy are used in 21 states.
 “This is a disease that is all about, 
‘I can’t,’” she said. “But we say you can.” 
Hammer said that although 
the program has physical benefits for patients, its main purpose is to 
take away the fear that so many 
Alzheimer’s patients live in. 
The artwork is also beneficial to 
people other than the clients, like their families, Hammer said.
“It says to their family members 
that this person can still do things,” Hammer said. “They can still pro-duce beauty .” 
Staffers can see the results, too.“They all come out looking so 
proud about their work,” said resi-dent nurse Elsie Cichoracki. “I’m amazed by some of their work.”
Once the palm tree painting was 
complete, both Hammer and Doris admired their hard work.
“It’s perfect,” Doris said.
“I love it,” Hammer said. “It’s so 
beautiful.”Patients use painting for therapy
UF was not one of the six 
Florida schools named in The 
Princeton Review’s list of the 100 Best Value Colleges for 2009, released Thursday . 
But according to UF 
spokesman Steve Orlando, UF is absent from the list because of an e-mail blip between UF’s Office of Institutional Planning and Research and The Princeton Review. 
New College of Florida, 
Florida State University , the 
University of South Florida, 
the University of North Florida, the University of Central Florida and Rollins College made the list. FSU and New College of Florida ranked in the top ten for pub-lic colleges. 
Orlando said The Princeton 
Review e-mailed questions to UF to gather ranking infor -
mation. UF replied, but The 
Princeton Review never re-
ceived the 
message.
“I feel 
pretty cer -
tain we 
would be considered an ex-cellent value,” Orlando said.
Orlando said that 
Kiplinger’s Personal Finance magazine ranked UF as the No. 2 best valued public college in 2008, behind the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The 6,500 Gators fans cheered 
on the women to an 80-66 victory in their Southeastern Conference opener against Mississippi State, extending their school-record 
winning streak to 15 games.
The first 37 minutes saw sev-
en lead changes, as neither team 
could pull away from the other. 
With just un-der three min-utes left, the No. 18 Gators finally claimed 
the game’s first 
d o u b l e - d i g i t 
lead and put the Bulldogs down for good.
It was only right for senior 
guard Sha Brooks to hit the layup that finished off Mississippi State. 
Brooks ended the night 12 of 21 
for a career-high 31 points — she is the first to score 30 points for UF since Bernice Mosby dropped 31 on Dec. 22, 2003.
The start of SEC play forced 
Brooks to elevate her play.
“You got to step it up,” Brooks 
said. “(SEC play) is a whole ’nother level, you just have to 
bring your ‘A’ game every night, 
and that’s what I did.”
Although the game stayed 
close throughout, the Gators con-
trolled the pace for most of the 
second half.
They made a deliberate effort 
to take care of the ball to reduce the number of turnovers and, 
consequently, Mississippi State’s 
chances off them. The Gators allowed just 2 points off eight turnovers in the second half com-pared to 19 points off 12 before the break.
Another halftime adjustment 
that led to their second-half suc-cess was the switch to more zone defense, after the Bulldogs had success against the Gators’ man-to-man defense.
“We played a lot more zone 
in the second half than we did in the first half, and that got them off-balance a little,” UF coach Amanda Butler said. “They are such a great attacking team, and (the zone) took some of their 
weapons away.”
The game went as well as 
Butler could have hoped, except 
for an injury to guard Jennifer Mossor, who left the game with 
12 minutes remaining after a right 
knee injury and did not return to the game. Butler was unsure how serious the injury is.20, ALLIGATOR  FRIDAY, JANUARY 9, 2009

It’s not déjà vu. Relax, you’re not seeing double.
For the second night in a row, a Gators-Sooners matchup 
is in the works. The UF gymnastics team will open its season against Oklahoma at 7 p.m., one night after the two schools clashed for the national championship in football.
“It’s a crazy coincidence,” sophomore Alicia Goodwin said. One school is feeling great about Thursday’s outcome, while 
the other hopes to salvage an unusually orange-blue-crimson-and-cream tinted weekend.
“We definitely want to start our season with a really strong 
win,” Goodwin said. “It’s against Oklahoma, so if we (and the football team) win, that’ll be great.”
But this meet would be important regardless of the Gators’ 
opponent.
“It’s important for everyone, seniors versus freshmen, to 
start off 1-0,” junior Maranda Smith said. “Even for those of us, like myself, that have competed before, it always feels good to start the season with a win, so it goes hand in hand.”
Junior Melanie Sinclair said even a BCS national champion-
ship wouldn’t quell her hopes of beating Oklahoma.
“Who wants to lose? I love winning,” 
Sinclair said. “I know I want to beat them, 
just as bad, or more.”
The football team may have had to wait 
more than a month for its showdown with Oklahoma, but the wait for the gymnastics team has been longer and perhaps even more unbearable.
“We’ve been working so hard and doing 
really well, it just flew by , and I’m so excited 
that the first meet is here,” Smith said.
Even in Thursday’s practice, there was an air of anticipation 
about the Oklahoma meet.
“This is what they work for,” UF coach Rhonda Faehn said. 
“They’re natural-born performers and they love it. They would much rather be out there on the competition floor competing than in the gym training.”
All the practice and mock meets have led to a familiar sce-
nario: a confident UF team.
“I feel like (Oklahoma is) going to be competition, and it al-
ways depends who’s going to bring it that day,” Sinclair said. 
“But I have no doubts about how great our gymnastics team is 
as well.”
Smith said in order to do well, the team has to focus on itself 
more than its competition.
“I feel that we can win, in that we’re a better team,” Smith 
said.
This is more than just the second matchup between UF and 
Oklahoma in as many days.
“Starting out with a win is going to help us, in the future, 
build up the confidence and know that we can go in there and do it,” Sinclair said.UF opens with OU GATORS APPROACH SIGNING DAY 
WITH SPEED AND SIZE IN MIND.

While the Gators’ tickets to the BCS 
National Championship Game were 
punched Dec. 6 with a win against Alabama, the journey began much earlier. 
Not in August, but in February 2006, 
when many of the current UF players com-mitted to take snaps in Gainesville.
National Signing Day this year is Feb. 4, 
and until then, coaches will call, host, visit and send letters to high school seniors in hopes of swaying them to their schools. The work done over the next few weeks will lay the groundwork for the next few years.
Last weekend, the Gators got a boost 
to their class at the U.S. Army and Under Armour All-American games when they received oral commitments from linebacker Jon Bostic, offensive tackle Xavier Nixon and wide receiver Andre Debose.
The Gators already have 16 commit-
ments — 14 oral — for next season and have put a priority on two things: swiftness and bulk. Speed has been a UF trademark 
for years, so it’s no surprise the team has 
targeted quick skill players. But the number of linemen bound for Gainesville (already 10 combined defensive and offensive) is surprising.
Debose, of Sanford Seminole High, is 
considered one of the most explosive play-ers in the class. Recruiting Web sites and forums have been making Debose-Percy 
Harvin comparisons for months, despite 
what Debose thinks.
“I don’t compare myself to nobody,” 
Debose said.He is not as technically sound as other 
top receivers, but he impressed scouts at the Under Armour Game, and Mike Bakas of Scout.com said Debose has emerged as a 
potential game-breaker
“There were probably 10 or 11 receivers 
(at the Under Armour Game) — all four-, 
five-star guys — and Debose was the most explosive kid among them,” Bakas said.
Nixon is the No. 1 offensive tackle on 
Scout.com and is very athletic, consider -
ing his 6-foot-6, 285-pound frame. The Fayetteville, N.C., Jack Britt High star plays basketball for his high school team, which could help him dominate in pass protec-tion, where footwork is key.
While much of the class is set, UF is still 
pursuing a few recruits who could push this year’s class from the top 20 to the top 
five. 
The Gators have found themselves in 
some head-to-head recruiting battles over 
players like Maryland-based linebacker 
Jelani Jenkins (Penn State), Georgia na-
tive linebacker Jarvis Jones (Georgia) and Seffner Armwood High defensive end Ryne Giddins (South Florida).
Then there’s cornerback Greg Reid. Reid 
orally committed to Florida last February but has recently de-committed and will vis-it Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi State — now home to former UF offensive coor -
dinator Dan Mullen — later this month.
Oral commitments are non-binding until a 
national letter-of-intent is signed on National 
Signing Day on Feb. 4.

It doesn’t take much for old 
friends to become familiar foes.
When UF (13-2) takes the 
court against Mississippi (9-5) on 
Saturday, the Gators will try to 
avoid being haunted by a ghost of 
the past. 
Rebels guard David Huertas, a 
UF transfer, was a member of the 
2006 national championship team.
Huertas, who leads Mississippi 
in scoring with 20 points per 
game this season, said farewell to Gainesville after his freshman year 
because of concerns over playing 
time.
Now, UF coach Billy Donovan 
hopes he won’t be stung by the 
one who got away, and Mississippi 
coach Andy Kennedy knows 
Huertas will be ready to play his old team.
“No question his emotions will 
be charged,” Kennedy said.
Huertas scored 7 points in 
the Rebels’ 89-87 win against the 
Gators in Oxford last year.
Senior Walter Hodge looks for -
ward to going toe to toe with his long-time friend once again.
Hodge, who played with 
Huertas as a freshman at UF, goes back quite a ways with the Rebel sharpshooter. 
Like Hodge, Huertas is a native 
of Puerto Rico, and the two have fond memories of playing with and against each other as children.
“It will be just like back home,” 
Hodge said.
Hodge said he regularly talks 
to his old teammate, and they are both looking forward to Huertas’ homecoming.
“I spoke to him two weeks ago. 
Just to see how he’s doing and wished him good luck,” Hodge said.
The two guards came off the 
bench for UF during the Gators’ 2006 national title run.
Huertas, a junior, has been 
forced to shoulder the load for Mississippi this season after inju-ries to three of the Rebels’ top four scorers. 
Eniel Polynice, Trevor Gaskins 
and Chris Warren have all been sidelined with knee injuries, leav-ing the Rebels almost solely de-pendent on Huertas on the offen-sive end of the floor.
“We’ve had to try and reinvent 
ourselves a couple of different times this season,” Kennedy said. “But we realize this is the hand we’ve been dealt.”
With Huertas now the fo-
cal point of the Rebels attack, Kennedy worries the guard might make Saturday’s game a little too personal.
“I don’t want him to put too 
much pressure on himself,” Kennedy said. “That’s what we’re trying to guard against.” 
Kennedy will have his hands 
full trying to calm a young team that he says is more than eager to start off conference play against the Gators.
“They have never been in 
Gainesville before, so they’re ex-
cited about it,” he said. 
“I don’t think that would be 
the case if they had been there be-
fore.”
For UF, the more things change, 
the more they stay the same.
The Gators start Southeastern 
Conference play with the same record they did last season — and the same questions. 
A young team, a short bench 
and an inexperienced frontcourt are all cause for concern.
But Donovan is optimistic this 
year’s team will be more prepared for the long road they are about to travel down.
 “Having been through the con-ference once, I think there is a little 
more of an awareness of what’s in 
front of them,” Donovan said.
It’s the freshmen who keep the 
coach up at night.
While Donovan has tried to ex-
plain the jump they are about to make, no explanation may be good 
enough.
“In life, we learn and grow from 
our own individual experiences,” Donovan said.  “They just might 
have to see it for themselves.” 
Wins and losses may hinge on 
how fast Erving Walker, Kenny 
Kadji and Ray Shipman acclimate to the SEC.
“In the non-conference, you’re 
not really playing for anything other than to get better,” Donovan said. “I think we’re all playing for something now.”FRIDAY, JANUARY 9, 2009  ALLIGATOR, 21

MIAMI — It’s funny to think that 
a player who committed two turn-
overs served as a stabilizing influ-ence on the winning team.
Sam Bradford had the better sta-
tistics at the end of the game with 256 passing yards and two touchdowns, but it was Tebow who got to hold the coaches’ trophy in the Gators 24-14 win against the Sooners. 
After doing something he had 
never done in the first half — throwing two interceptions in one game. Tebow transformed to  2007 
Heisman-winning form by running 
linebackers over and stampeding into the history once again. Tebow finished with 231 yards through the air and two touchdowns.
“I struggled in the first half,” 
Tebow said. “I just tried to get the ball out quick, and they did a good job of getting to me early on. We had 
to make some adjustments.”
Tebow finished with 109 yards on the ground, and most of them 
came in the second half.
“I was coming out here trying to 
play with everything I had,” Tebow said.
So it would make sense that he 
went into halftime and told his team 
he wouldn’t let them down.
“The guy was furi-
ous,” junior receiver David Nelson said of 
Tebow.
After hearing Oklahoma cor -
nerback Dominique Franks trash talk earlier in the week about how Tebow would be the fourth-best quarterback in the Big 12, Nelson said they should send some choco-lates and flowers to Franks for moti-vating Tebow even more.
 “Tebow was just being Tebow,” 
said junior receiver Percy Harvin, 
who stole much of the offensive 
spotlight with 171 total offensive yards. “He’s been the man all year. He’s our great inspirational leader. When he comes into the game, he lifts everybody up.”QB’s fortitude more 
important than stats
The rest of the country can vouch for that. 
After UF’s only loss of the season to Mississippi, 
countless clips of Tebow promising to outwork every other play in America were replayed on ESPN.  Now, it would be tough for anyone to 
argue Tebow isn’t a man of his word.
He had an uncharacteristic first half, throw-
ing two interceptions, matching his entire sea-
son total to that point.  
On UF’s second drive of the second half, 
the 2007 Heisman Trophy winner took over. He led the Gators 75 yards on 13 plays and did most of the heavy lifting himself. He ran six times for 48 yards and completed one pass for 
11 yards.
“He’s just one of those guys,” Oklahoma 
defensive back Nic Harris said, “You give him 
your best shot, he’s going to get back up.”
Then the defense once again added a stop of its own. The Sooners moved their way down the field, but Stamper stopped Oklahoma running back Chris Brown on 3rd-and-1 and forced Oklahoma to attempt a 49-yard field goal.
UF defensive end Carlos Dunlap showed 
his massive wingspan and blocked the kick, tying a school record for blocked kicks in a 
single season (9).
The offensive spark came from Harvin, 
who said after the game he felt about 90 per -
cent. The junior playmaker finished with five 
catches for 49 yards and 122 yards rushing on 9 carries along with one touchdown.
“There’s no better feeling. Nobody gave us 
a chance to win the game,” Harvin said. “They said we weren’t tough enough.”
The Gators defense did allow Brown to 
gain 110 rushing yards on 22 carries, but they had big stops against the junior running back. 
The Sooners seemed to be poised to score 
after taking over at the Gators’ 26-yard line in the second quarter after a Tebow intercep-tion. Brown ran three straight times to take the ball to the UF 1-yard line. But the junior was stuffed two straight times for no gain by UF defensive linemen Jermaine Cunningham and Torrey Davis.
Both teams entered Thursday night’s game 
averaging more than 45 points, but it was the defenses who left their mark early leading to a scoreless opening 15 minutes. Oklahoma was held scoreless in a quarter for only the  sixth time this season and the first in the opening quarter of play.
UF free safety Major Wright upped the in-tensity when he ran across the field to break up a pass intended for an open Manuel Johnson. The Oklahoma wide receiver had beaten cor -
nerback Joe Haden down the left sideline after a pump fake by Sam Bradford. Wright did his best Reggie Nelson impression, laying Johnson out and leaving him dazed on the ground.
In the end, Tebow came through. In the 
fourth quarter, after a key Ahmad Black inter -
ception, the junior quarterback led his team on a 11-play, 76-yard drive that ate up 6:52 of clock time and essentially sealed the victory .   
It was an old standby that would clinch the 
victory for UF. Tebow ran to his left, jumped and hit a cutting David Nelson.
“I promised the guys that I would go out 
and play with all my heart,” Tebow said. “ I 
was so motivated tonight. Oklahoma’s a great 
team and they came out and played hard. I’m so proud of my teammates right now. I can’t put into words — it was just an incredible night.”

UF quarterback Tim Tebow rushes for a gain during the second half of the Gators’ 24-14 national cham-
pionship win against Oklahoma in Dolphin Stadium in Miami Gardens Thursday night.from bad refereeing to bad sportsmanship, bad fan etiquette and even a 
mistimed jet flyover during the third line of the national anthem.
Oklahoma fans booed while Murphy was cramping on the ground 
in the third quarter. UF fans booed during Oklahoma’s fight song after Sooners fans remained quiet during the Gators’.
Both sets of fans booed after referees couldn’t figure out how to get the 
clock to read the correct time, and the lethargic tempo of the game got to the players.
“The slow pace of the first half, that really wore down on the defense,” 
defensive end and the game’s Defensive MVP Carlos Dunlap said. “It got us to the point where you want to think about pointing fingers.”
But in the end, the ugly duckling turned into a graceful swan for UF. The Gators cemented their legacy as the best team in the country. Years 
from now we’ll be wondering how in God’s name Mississippi came into 
The Swamp and upset the national champions. 
The only ones who still think this game was hideous, a disaster, a game 
that will be forgotten in 15 years?
That would be the Oklahoma Sooners.
For UF, though, the end result is all that matters. They leave South 
Florida as national champions for the second time in three years.
Now that’s beautiful.on his leg, causing Harvin’s body to jolt, and it left the receiver on the 
ground for several minutes.
“He tried to slow me down, 
and it didn’t work,” Harvin said. 
“I expected that because everyone knew about my injury , but I was able to push through it and didn’t let it stop me.”
That was the second scare for 
Gators’ fans with Harvin, who was 
rumored to have tweaked his ankle 
again in practice this week.
Those suspicions were backed 
up on UF’s first play, when Harvin remained on the sideline, but any questions about his health were answered two plays later, when he caught a 3rd-and-8 slant from quarterback Tim Tebow, worked his way to the right sideline and outran a few defenders for a gain 
of 19 yards.
Harvin’s trouble decelerating 
was clear after the play. He had to 
jog another 25 yards before turn-ing back to the huddle, but the run brought renewed confidence.
“That was the first time I plant-
ed while running that fast, so when I did that play, I knew I was going 
to be okay,” Harvin said.

MIAMI – Earlier this week, UF receiver Percy Harvin 
said the only lingering effect from his sprained ankle was 
that it made it hard to slow down.
Luckily for Harvin, most of his work in the No. 1 
Gators’ 24-14 win against No. 2 Oklahoma in the BCS Championship Game involved speeding up.
The junior led UF in rushing with 122 yards and a 
touchdown on just nine carries, and he added another 49 yards on five catches, a productive night from a player whose health was in question right up until kickoff.
UF receivers coach Billy Gonzales said Harvin only 
took about nine snaps in each practice this week. He wasn’t sure the playmaker would be his usual self.
“We didn’t know what to expect,” Gonzales said. “It 
was one of the hardest game plans to put together be-
cause we didn’t know if he’d be able to go all the way . 
What an awesome performance from him.”
In addition to his touchdown, a 2-yard run to make 
the score 14-7 in the third quarter, Harvin was instrumen-tal in the Gators’ other scoring drives.
He kicked off UF’s second possession with a 15-yard 
reception, a drive that ended with a 20-yard touchdown from receiver Louis Murphy for the game’s first score.
Then, he opened a fourth-quarter drive with a 52-yard 
carry down the right sideline to Oklahoma’s 26, and he followed that up with a 12-yard run.
He was on a roll and looked poised for a second touch-
down, but after the play, Sooners safety Nic Harris yanked Harvin returns from injury to lead Gators to victoryFRIDAY, JANUARY 9, 2009

MIAMI This was the ugliest game you’ve 
ever seen for the first 40 minutes. This game was a train wreck. A 
slow-paced, whistle-filled, commercial-clogged mess of a game.
This was a game that had a timeout 
called by each side just before a punt and then saw UF get flagged for rough-ing a punter.
This was a game that had Louis 
Murphy flagged for enthusiastically signaling he just made a first down.
This was a game that saw Tim 
Tebow double his interception total on 
the season in just 23 minutes of game 
time.
And then the last 20 minutes hap-
pened.
In that time, the game that you 
thought ditched you — the speedy, back-and-forth, smooth-flowing game — returned. Both teams scored touch-downs to keep the game tied at 14. 
Percy Harvin became that liquid, cuts-like-a-razor running back 
who burned 
Oklahoma for a combined 64 yards on back-to-back 
plays. The UF 
special teams got a rally-kill-ing field goal 
block from Carlos Dunlap. The Sam Bradford-led Sooners opened up the fast-snap offense with success.

up and end suddenly became a jewel

MIAMI – The prevailing sentiment entering 
the BCS National Championship Game was 
that whichever team played defense would win the game. 
What everyone failed to consider was the 
possibility that both defenses would show up and play well. 
After weeks of hearing about the possibility 
that both teams could combine for 100 points, neither team scored a single point in the first quarter of UF’s 24-14 victory over Oklahoma.
“It’s all about defense and we pride our -
selves in playing great defense,” linebacker Brandon Spikes said. “And we came out and 
played great defense today.”
No play provided proof of this as much as 
Ahmad Black’s fourth quarter interception 
with ten minutes remaining in the game. With the Sooners attempting to take the lead after a Jonathan Phillips field goal put the Gators up 17-14, Heisman Trophy winner Sam Bradford attempted a pass down the middle to Juaquin Iglesias. Iglesias appeared to reel the pass in, but Black came in at the last moment and stole the ball away . 
“At first I thought they both might have 
come down with it,” linebacker Ryan Stamper said. “But when I saw that he came up with it I knew that if our defense went out and scored we would win it.”
UF’s defense set a defensive tone early 
when Major Wright laid a big hit on Oklahoma 
receiver Manuel Johnson on what would have 
likely been a touchdown had 
Wright not come over. 
“It’s just part of my game 
and it’s just reading the quarterback and he brought me right to the ball,” Wright said. “After that hit I told him it would be a really 
physical game.”
Four plays later, Heisman 
Trophy winner Sam Bradford was sacked by 
linebacker Brandon Hicks. 
There was a plethora of dubious firsts for
