◗ ABOUT 500 PEOPLE 
HAVE REGISTERED TO ATTEND THE DAYLONG SYMPOSIUM.

UF’s yearlong celebration 
of land-grant universities 
will conclude today with a conference about online education called “Bricks and Mortar in a Digital Age: The Uncertain Future of Higher Education.”
The daylong symposium 
will address the challenges and changes that face universities entering the digital era. 
Jeff Selingo, editor of 
the Chronicle of Higher Education, and Daphne Koller, co-founder of Coursera, will speak at the event.
“This is an opportunity 
for the University of Florida to start the conversation about the future of higher education on a global scale,” said Teri Balser, dean of the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences and head of the event.
The event will be at the 
University Auditorium, and about 500 people have registered to attend, Balser said. 
More people will watch 
from around the world via live stream, which is available on the website, and a Twitter hashtag to follow.
“We’ll tackle questions 
like ‘are professors obsolete?’ and if higher education is worth the costs,” Balser said.
The symposium is hosted 
by UF but is aimed at all universities around the world, according to a news release.
Balser said she is excited 
to discuss these topics in a setting that allows such a large number of people to participate.
“One UF professor of ours 
is teaching a class in Italy right now,” she said. “She said she was going to have her students watch the live stream in class tomorrow.”UF, experts to

Many trees on UF’s campus were 
painted blue about six months ago to 
make a statement. But some Gators have begun to think the message has been lost.
Australian artist Konstantin Di-
mopoulos painted UF’s trees blue with an environmentally safe pig-ment that would last up to nine months, according to his website. He chose blue because he associates the color with sacredness, and he want-ed to make his viewers aware of the trees’ existence and the deforestation that occurs worldwide.
Noel Kassewitz, who helped paint 
the trees, still notices them. However, the UF 22-year-old ﬁ  ne arts senior said not everyone does.
“I do feel people have gotten used 
to the blue trees, and they no longer have quite the shock factor they ini-tially did,” she said. “But we get tons of visitors on campus, so I’m sure it’s still quite the surprise to them and UF’s blue trees losing shock factor

A bogus email containing profanity that 
went out last week to about 8,000 patrons of 
local food delivery service Gainesville2Go hasn’t cursed the company’s business.
After Gainesville2Go food delivery service 
announced the email sent Thursday was from a disgruntled former employee, the company attempted to make amends by offering free delivery for the weekend.
From Friday to Sunday, the company expe-
rienced a two- to three-times greater number of deliveries, said Jackson Bodiford, a Gaines-ville2Go manager.
Friday was the busiest, he said, with 278 
deliveries. Saturday was next, with 260 deliv-eries, and Sunday, the service made 238 deliv-eries. During the weekend, he said, Gainesvil-le2Go handled about $4,000 in food sales.
On Sunday evening, he said, the service 
had to stop taking orders for about an hour to catch up with the demand.
“We just got too busy there for a minute,” 
he said.
After the frenzied weekend, the company 
closed Monday and Tuesday — a period, Bod-iford said, management needed to respond to the ﬂ  ood of customers the weekend brought.
“We hired more drivers,” he said. “I think 
we’re pretty adequately staffed.”
Lacey Sanchez, a 21-year-old UF food and 
resource economics junior, said she ordered Asian food twice from Gainesville2Go during the weekend.
She said she appreciated the company’s 
free delivery offer.
“I think it was a really kind gesture,” she 
said.

Israeli choreographer Dana Rutten-
berg has spent this semester, teaching 
and interacting with students in the UF School of Theatre + Dance.
While Ruttenberg has been teach-
ing two courses in modern dance tech-nique, she has also choreographed a new, original piece that she and her students will perform today, Friday and Sunday at the Constans Theatre.
The Schusterman Visiting Artist 
Program sends Israeli artists to study and teach at American universities.
“It’s a huge honor to be part of it,” 
Ruttenberg said.
Originally from Tel Aviv, Rutten-
berg lived in New York from 1999 to 2003. Her choreography has been per-formed in Senegal, Hungary, Italy, the U.S. and Russia.
“It is great to go back and explore 
a different part of the country,” she said.
Ruttenberg said this semester has 
been great.“In Israel, I teach at different plac-
es. [There are] different students, dif-ferent levels and [I] work with my company,” she said. “Here, I’m com-pletely dedicated to the students.”
Dance senior Kate Pope, 21, has 
found Ruttenberg to be an inspira-tion.
“Dana is the cherry on top to four 
wonderful years of dancing at UF,” Pope said.
Ruttenberg said the piece, which 
is set to the ﬁ  rst part of Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring,” features 11 fe-male dancers.
“Making the piece was one of the 
best challenges of my collegiate ca-reer,” Pope said. “Dana’s piece is in-formed by the spirit of our time and our experiences together.”
sparks art and environmental conversations.”
Jasper Curry notices them, too, but questions the mes-
sage.
“It’s slightly ironic how we’re talking about protecting 
nature while we’re painting it blue,” said the 20-year-old 
economics junior.
Richard Heipp, interim director of UF’s School of Art 
+ Art History, said Dimopoulos’ method might not be the most effective.
“It depends on the deﬁ  nition of effective,” he said.Heipp said the exhibit might become pedestrian, but it 
can also cause double takes.
The exhibit cost $22,000 and was funded by the UF Foun-
dation, according to Alligator archives.
Some people may wonder why the money wasn’t used to 
help a foundation that works to prevent deforestation.
“The objective is different,” Heipp said. “[Artists] are 
more about getting the message across through poetry. It causes the viewer to have an interaction and asks viewers to make associations.”
UF student Shannon Smith agrees with Heipp.“I much prefer statement art over donations,” said the 
19-year-old biology sophomore. “But that’s because I always feel bad because I don’t have money to donate.”
Martha Monroe, a professor in the UF School of Forest 
Resources and Conservation, said the blue trees increase awareness of the importance of urban trees, which increase carbon sequestration, manage stormwater and reduce tem-perature.
Walking on Turlington Plaza, Smith still notices the out-
of-the-ordinary trees and their symbolism for deforestation awareness.
“I don’t think they will ever become the norm,” she said.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, APRIL 11, 2013

A Wednesday morning crash 
left one man in the hospital with 
serious injuries after he rear-ended a Regional Transit System bus on Northwest 39th Avenue.
At about 8:30 a.m., a man in 
his 70s was driving westbound in a Toyota pickup truck and hit a route-eight RTS bus as it was leaving a stop near the intersection of Northwest 21st Street and Northwest 39th Avenue. 
The man was driving about 
45 mph, Gainesville Police spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias said.The man was rushed to Shands 
at UF with multiple broken bones and internal bleeding, Tobias said.
As of Wednesday afternoon, 
the man was recovering from surgery for his injuries, said RTS spokesman Chip Skinner. 
The bus driver and three 
passengers evacuated the bus, Skinner said. 
None of them were hurt. However, the driver was taken to Shands as a precaution. 
GPD closed a westbound lane 
on Northwest 39th Avenue after the crash until about 11 a.m.
This was the ﬁ  rst of three 
accidents Wednesday that involved cars rear-ending buses, Skinner said.
At about 4:30 p.m., a car hit a 
route 75 bus on Southwest Archer Road and shortly after 5:30 p.m., another car crashed into a route 13 bus on Southwest 13th Street.
Skinner recommended that 
drivers pay more attention to the road to prevent accidents like these.
“It really comes down to 
people being aware of their surroundings,” he said.

Carmen Carrera came on stage Wednes-
day night wearing a black cloak. When 
she took it off, she was left wearing rhine-stones.
Carrera, a drag queen made famous by 
the television program RuPaul’s Drag Race, performed in Pride Awareness Month’s an-nual drag show at UF on Wednesday at the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom.
“Friends of Dorothy: A Drag Show” fea-
tured a montage of performances by drag queens and kings including RuPaul’s Drag Race’s Willam and Detox.
Jade Jolie, a former contestant on Ru-
Paul’s Drag Race and Gainesville local, was also in the show.
Ryan Ragusa, a 26-year-old Ocala resi-
dent, said he went to the show because it makes him feel comfortable.
“It opens up your eyes,” he said. “The 
performers joke around but also expose their community in the public.”
The show opened with Willam, the host. 
She started the string of performances by lip-synching to “Let’s Have a Kiki” by the Scissor Sisters.
Carrera’s performances 
were received by a line of audience members hand-ing her dollar bills. She acknowledged each of her 
fans with a kiss on the cheek.
Each of the performers 
walked through the aisles of the ballroom and interacted with the audience mem-bers.
The attendance at the event was capped 
at 812 people, said Hiram Martinez Cabre-ra, one of the show’s directors.
The line outside the ballroom continued 
even after the show started.
Cabrera, a 19-year-old public relations 
freshman, said about 1,200 people attended the event last year. The cap this year was reduced due to safety regulations.
Although the number of permitted at-
tendees was reduced, Cabrera said the popularity of the show and Pride Aware-ness Month has increased each year.
“I knew it would grow, but I did not 
imagine it would this quickly,” he said. “It’s amazing.”

You’re not the only one reading 
the newspaper, according to data 
compiled by the Newspaper Associa-tion of America.
U.S. newspapers’ revenue declined 
by 2 percent in 2012 — the smallest decline in the past six years. In 2012, the industry made $38.6 billion, com-pared with $39.5 billion in 2011.
For the first time, the report took 
into consideration newspapers’ changing revenue strategies, focus-ing on readership, digital news and newer revenue sources.
Mike Foley, a professor in the UF 
College of Journalism and Communi-cations, said newspapers have strug-gled with losing readership to online news sources and classifieds to web-sites like Craigslist.
“It continues to be a sad state of af-
fairs when it’s a cause for excitement when the decline is less than it has been,” he said.
However, profits from circulation 
grew by 5 percent in 2012, the first in-crease in the category since 2003.
Jennifer Ortiz, a 21-year-old UF English junior, said she thinks the increase may be because there’s a lot happening in the world right now.
She said newspapers are more fo-
cused than online news sources.
“It’s all framed, so you see the 
more important things first,” she said. “On the Internet, I have a much shorter attention span.”
Although newspapers are adapt-
ing to the digital world, Foley said, the industry made a mistake when it didn’t take action when the Internet first gained popularity.
“They should have realized they 
were in the information business, not the newspaper business,” he said. “It’s hard to make people pay for something they got for free for so long.”Data shows newspapers not dead yet, Foley weighs inTHURSDAY, APRIL 11, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Marnell’s book: Good, bad or unhealthy?
“All I’ve ever wanted my whole life,” Cat Marnell, for-
mer beauty editor of www.xoJane.com and former VICE columnist, writes in her book proposal to Simon 
& Schuster, “was a way to escape and get numb.”
The 35-page outline and 38-page personal essay netted 
her a $500,000 advance, Jezebel reported. Marnell became famous for documenting her heavy drug use in beauty col-umns for www.xoJane.com and her series of columns for VICE, “Amphetamine Logic.”
If you’re in the mood to feel really depressed, read her 
VICE columns — she writes about her father, a psychiatrist who ﬁ  rst put her on Adderall at 15, and her subsequent ad-diction to speed since then, among other things. She’s like a character from a Bret Easton Ellis novel, and her emaciated body and ever-present smeared eye makeup cause her to look like a Barbie doll that’s been dragged around by a dog.
She writes about taking Plan B three times in a month, 
her obsession with thinness and her cavorts around New York City and San Francisco with married male celebrities. Her stories run in the same vein as Lindsay Lohan, Courtney Love and Edie Sedgwick: bleach-blond train wrecks, always searching for a ﬁ  x. 
Although Simon & Schuster is essentially handing Mar-
nell $500,000 to spend on cocaine and PCP, its decision to pick up Marnell’s memoir is a brilliant business move. After all, it’s impossible to look away from a train wreck.
Marnell knows this and writes at the end of her book pro-
posal (which was leaked to a few online news outlets), “I will write a New York Times #1 Bestseller. Swag!” Her proposed title: “How to Murder Your Life.”
Although the book will be a ﬁ  rst-hand account of addic-
tion, hers is not a story of redemption and recovery. Though employers have coerced Marnell to go to rehab in the past, she calls her addiction a lifestyle choice. According to a New York Times proﬁ  le, Marnell left xoJane in late 2012.
In a statement to Page Six, Marnell said, “I couldn’t spend 
another summer meeting deadlines behind a computer at night when I could be on the rooftop of Le Bain looking for shooting stars and smoking angel dust with my friends and writing a book, which is what I’m doing next.”Marnell’s aesthetic is puzzling.   
Is it a gimmick? Is the sexy, free-spirited druggie act all contrived?
Beyond her dubious personal 
marketing strategy lies the ethical dilemma of Simon & Schuster edi-tors knowingly supplying a self-proclaimed addict with enough money to keep her high for a long, long time.  
A Forbes article titled “Cat Marnell, Buzz Bissinger and 
the Ethics of Publishing an Addict” quoted Simon & Schus-ter editor Sarah Knight on the house’s decision to purchase Marnell’s memoir.
“I think if somebody can put together a book proposal 
and can write 40 terriﬁ  c pages, she’s obviously in control of her behavior,” Knight said. “I don’t really think it’s for me to judge whether Cat is or should be allowed to write a book because of circumstances in her past.”
However, Forbes writer Jeff Bercovici argued that the 
matter still raises unsettling questions.
“Is there something exploitative about handing a mega-
phone and a fat wad of cash to someone who suffers from pathological impulsivity? Is it a form of enabling?” Bercov-ici wrote.  “Is there a line beyond which a writer’s need to share the darkest details of his or her existence deserves to be viewed as a symptom? And what, if any, are a publisher’s responsibilities when faced with a writer who has crossed over that line?”
Knight’s statement is a cop-out when faced with the ques-
tionable ethics of rewarding a drug addict with money and attention. Marnell herself writes in her proposal, “Between you and me, half the time I feel very little remorse. AND I have a massive ego.”
Although the decision to publish Marnell is smart in 
terms of strategy — the book will sell, obviously, and may indeed become a New York Times Bestseller — what is the real cost?
Chloe Finch is a journalism sophomore at UF. Her column 
runs on Thursdays.Global Wine-ing: 
Why is the wine 
gone?
Why don’t more people believe in the effects of climate change? We’re not going to call it global warming because everyone throws a giant, political hissy ﬁ  t 
and then makes “So cold out today, I thought there was global warming” Facebook statuses.
Climate change is a real thing that affects the environment 
everywhere on Earth.
Habitats are becoming unstable. Deserts are changing shape. 
Water isn’t ﬂ  owing the way it used to. Weather patterns are shifting. The past decade holds the hottest years on record, and temperatures show no signs of getting cooler on average.
Sure, a lot of this is probably normal. The Earth has been in 
and out of ice ages before, so it makes sense that it gets this hot at times. Fine. Humans aren’t helping the problem, though. It seems like most people won’t do anything about the problem until climate change affects something people care a lot about.
Get ready, folks, because your wine supply is about to hit a 
new mer-low. 
“Suitable grape-growing areas may drop 68 percent in Medi-
terranean Europe by 2050 and fall 73 percent in regions of Austra-lia with a so-called Mediterranean climate, according to a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,” a Bloomberg article reported. “New Zealand’s suitable area will more than double and it will also surge in northern Europe and western North America, it said.”
“The fact is that climate change will lead to a huge shakeup in 
the geographic distribution of wine production,” said Lee Han-nah, a senior scientist at Conservation International and an au-thor of the study, according to a report by the Guardian.
The study doesn’t necessarily promise that wine production 
will cease to exist or that growing wine grapes in the normal ar-eas is impossible — it’ll take new locations and more technology to keep areas producing normally.
“It will be harder and harder to grow those varieties that are 
currently growing in places in Europe,” Hannah said. “It doesn’t necessarily mean that [they] can’t be grown there, but it will re-quire irrigation and special inputs to make it work, and that will make it more and more expensive.”
The study used 17 different climate models to make its predic-
tion. It “used two different climate futures for 2050, one assum-ing a worst-case scenario with a 4.7C (8.5F) warming, the other a 2.5C increase,” according to the Guardian article. “Both forecast a radical re-ordering of the wine world. The most drastic decline was expected in Europe, where the scientists found a 85 percent decrease in production in Bordeaux, Rhone and Tuscany.”
Don’t care about polar bears and how their homes are melt-
ing? Fine. Haven’t noticed how thick the air pollution in major cities has become? OK. Know someone who loves wine more than Ramona from the Real Housewives of New York? Probably not, because she’s nuts for it, but you more than likely will tell someone the news of the disappearing wine crops.
Yeah, the year 2050 is a little far off right now, but remem-
ber the Earth has been around for more than four billion years. Thirty-seven years is nothing.

Day 4: Saturday fash-
ion runway shows
My Style: Boho  
Intensity radiated off 
the runway as designer 
TanyaB started her show. 
Her designs seemed to reflect this ever-grow-ing trend of color-blocking, where fashionistas pair solid, bright colors with other solid blocks of color.
Macy’s confirmed these emerging summer 
trends for women with bold, colored jeans; sheer, collared tops; and tribal pieces. An un-expected trend in the show was conservative bathing suits resembling spandex shorts, all of which flattered the model’s figures.
TanyaB and Macy’s both presented sum-
mer styles with chunky necklaces, vibrant col-ors and various uses of geometric cutouts.
D&N Clothing presented a more youth-ful style that is currently filling partying col-lege students’ closets. The rage look combines neon colors, cut-up clothing, wild sayings and pointless hipster glasses. 
My personal favorite was the shirt broad-
casting the saying “walk of glory,” which was a spoof on the popular saying “walk of shame.” This shirt can speak for D&N’s entire line, which screams YOLO without actually saying YOLO.
Francine Elizabeth’s line reminds us all, 
with her bold risks, fashion is a true art. Styl-ing natural-looking browns with bright neon-green spiked collars gave the clothing an in-dependent, confident vibe. The combination of a fun summer look with a dangerous edge completely worked.
Headlining designer Carla Coultas’ styles 
embodied an edgy look for women stepping out of the norm and becoming their own with a variety of fur and studs. 
It was unique, eccentric and demonstrated 
new ways of wearing clothes that are already in our closets.ANGELA SKANE

DAY 1:  Wednesday 
opening-night art show
My Style: Edgy-chic
The empty retail space 
next to Vellos Brickstreet 
Grill came to life for the 
opening night of Gainesville Fashion Week. The small space was filled with a trendy 21-and-up crowd sipping on champagne and ad-miring art on display.
Weaving in and out of the crowd, models 
with bold makeup and intricate hair wore jew-elry from Stella & Dot and Jurney Jurray.
The music at the beginning of the night felt 
like an upbeat playlist from Forever 21 of songs no one really knows. Later in the evening, the DJ handed off his microphone, turning the at-tendees’ attention to musical performers.A Bob Marley piano tribute started off the 
acts and was followed by Camryn Wessner, a singer-songwriter who gave a female Jack Johnson vibe as she strummed her ukulele.
One GFW social media intern, Chin Chin 
Hao, performed covers of Rihanna and Justin Timberlake with her friend Tilman Monsanto.
UF’s a cappella group No Southern Accent 
captivated the crowd with its stage presence as the group performed a diverse set.
Closing out the performances in the gallery, Miami singer-songwriter Victoria performed a 
Lady Gaga mash-up and an original song.
After the performances, the social crowd 
spilled over to the bar at Vellos and continued to enjoy live music and drinks.
The art show was an intimate way to kick 
off GFW and get people excited. The trendy Gainesville crowd was able to enjoy a social night of art, music and a taste of the fashion to come in the next four days.THURSDAY, APRIL 11, 2013

Day 3: Friday fashion runway 
shows 
My Style: Sporty glam
Blue lights reflected off the ceil-
ing, adding to the cool atmosphere 
of Friday’s runway show in the University Air Cen-
ter’s Mustang Hangar.
The first model set the mood for Fresh Heirs’ jaunty 
collection, carrying a yellow smiley-faced balloon that complemented a colorful plaid dress topped with a fly transparent jacket. Big hair added to the experience of models rocking pieces of army fatigue and slightly ee-rie graphic tees.
Jacquelyn Brooks Designs, known for custom game-
day dresses, cruisewear and semiformal attire, was all about prints and symmetry. Her funky-fabulous ‘60s-inspired collection incorporated smoky lavender and chartreuse, repeating patterns with each look. Models swayed down the stage in wide-bottomed pants, skirts and dresses belted at the waist, making an imprint on the runway.
Built bodies in beachwear lined with bright hori-
zontal stripes and sea prints started the Macy’s Men’s collection, which evolved into a schoolboy look, fea-turing pinstriped shorts and button-downs. The men wore soft pinks and yellows and rocked the stage with color-blocks of blues and greens. They couldn’t have looked cleaner for spring.
Miami singer Kairo Gudino, aka Chalk, gave spec-
tators a break from their fashion high and sang origi-nal songs inspired by the late ‘70s and early ‘90s. He was followed by Anomaly, a UF dance crew, which splattered the stage while dancing in red and black.
The White House Black Market show demonstrat-
ed to the crowd it’s the little details that count. Spiced up with black and silver diamond accessories, this ma-ture and sophisticated collection demanded respect in black and white. During some parts of the show, it strayed away, incorporating pop-color shades of purple, all the while upholding its simplicity.
Headlining Designer Jay Nicolas Sario closed the 
show by displaying his collection from Thursday night, stealing the show for a second night in a row.DANA BURKE

Day 2: Thursday fashion runway 
show and panel discussion spon-sored by Pride Awareness Month  
My Style: Edgy with a girly twist  
Transforming the Reitz Grand 
Ballroom into a respectable fashion event sounds like it could be a big challenge. Perhaps that’s why the folks from Gainesville Fashion Week didn’t even try. (Shame on you, y’all.)
About 275 people sat waiting to hear from “Project 
Runway” season 8 contestant A.J. Thouvenot and season 7 finalist Jay Nicolas Sario.
What the room lacked in décor, host Jade Jolie, from 
season 5 of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” brought in the form of shiny silver leggings, fuzzy boots and a unicorn horn headdress over turquoise hair while asking predeter-mined questions to the panel.
Co-sponsored by UF’s Pride Student Union, the sec-
ond day of GFW’s sixth season was the event’s first on-campus affair. The talk produced a lot of “duhs” from the panel with questions about being gay in fashion — an is-sue that clearly doesn’t exist.
Short on time, only three audience members were able 
to ask questions, a ridiculous limit considering the seem-ingly infinite intermission later in the night.
Post-discussion came an unpredictable display from 
Thouvenot, incorporating jorts (a Gainesville staple), flannel shirts, tulle dresses and quirky prints. Playful sil-houettes were a reminder of the now-nonexistent fashion label Heatherette, a company Thouvenot interned for be-fore his time on “Project Runway.”
Next up: intermission. Although it almost bored me to 
death, the wait was worth it for Sario’s showcase. From the opening oxblood one-shoulder hi-lo dress to the men’s dark olive-green tweed coat, the 15-piece collection was flawless.
A cohesive mix of tweed, leather and chiffon in rich 
reds, greens, grays and blacks put the audience into a style-induced wonder.
My pro-tip for GFW season 7: Stay off campus. If the 
event continues to bring notable names and highlight lo-cal favorites, GFW could possibly host a full seven days of fashionable events instead of five — maybe.

One Florida credit union is looking to pay 
$25,000 plus perks for a hip representative to 
attract younger customers.
Tropical Financial Credit Union of South 
Florida is searching for a new “spokester,” a trendy version of a spokesperson, to connect with people ages 18 to 25 through social media and to lend personal ﬁ  nance advice.
Anyone interested in the position can visit 
www.youngfreeﬂ  orida.com, create a video saying why they would make a great spokes-person and write an entertaining ﬁ  nance-spe-ciﬁ  c blog post.
The winning spokester will receive a 
$25,000 salary with beneﬁ  ts. 
In addition to the sal-
ary is an Apple MacBook Pro notebook computer with Adobe Creative Suite software, a high-deﬁ  nition video camera with a micro-phone and accessories, an iPhone with a paid contract 
and a vehicle to drive, according to the Young & Free Florida website.
“I’ve always heard of Tropical Financial 
Credit Union, since I’m from South Florida,” said 19-year-old telecommunication sopho-more Peta-Gay Sheerwood. “But I always thought it was for older people.”
The credit union’s spokester will connect 
with the state’s young crowd by offering a translation of ﬁ  nancial needs to his or her peers, according to the Young & Free Florida website.
Sheerwood said she thinks it’s smart for the 
company to reach out to college-aged people because everyone connects through social me-dia sites like Facebook and Twitter.
“If a company or organization now doesn’t 
have some sort of social media, then they’re in the past, since that’s how everyone communi-cates now,” Sheerwood said.  
Amy McGraw, vice president of marketing 
for the credit union, said the spokester posi-tion is a better way to connect with the young generation on their terms.
“We, as credit unions, need to adjust and 
shift our thinking when connecting to this generation,” McGraw said.
The position entails offering ﬁ  nancial tips 
for situations like purchasing a car, applying for a credit card and budgeting ﬁ  nances.
“We’re excited to see what’s out there since 
we know Florida is full of talent,” McGraw said. “This would be an exciting year for someone.”

� THE FESTIVAL IS FROM APRIL 18 TO APRIL 20.

Music festivals are taking over the world. Whether it’s festa-
this or palooza-that, music festivals have become the hottest pastime for music lovers across the country.
With the transition from spring to summer, we are present-
ed with a three-day adventure in April an hour and 15 minutes north of Gainesville: the Wanee Music Festival.
Headlining, as always, is The Allman Brothers Band accom-
panied by Widespread Panic. The three-day festival kicks off April 18 and lasts until April 20 at the Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park in Live Oak, Fla.
The lineup features Michael Franti & Spearhead, Gov’t 
Mule, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Les Claypool’s Duo De Twang, Steel Pulse, Galactic and Friends, and more.
This year, Wanee will pair up with Conscious Alliance to 
co-host an Art That Feeds Food Drive. Anyone who donates 20 nonperishable food items to the Conscious Alliance gallery at the festival will receive a free Wanee festival poster, according to the festival’s website.“I think it’s awesome that festivals get involved in making a 
difference in this world, especially a festival that’s outdoors in a natural setting — not on some race track,” said Michael Franti of Michael Franti & Spearhead.
Voice of the Wetlands Allstars will also perform. This jazzy 
blues group, which comprises members from other Louisiana funk bands, tours in support of the preservation of Louisiana’s wetlands.  
“Music is something that really unites people,” Franti said. 
“It doesn’t matter if it’s 10 people at my house and we’re all jamming and playing guitars ... or it’s 10,000 people at a festi-val. Music has this way of bringing us together.”
Tickets are on sale at www.waneefestival.com for $215, 
which includes primitive camping and three days of shows.Music-loving campers jam for a cause at Wanee Music Festival

you like to get some Mediocre Advice? Visit http://mediocreadvicegators.tumblr.com/ask
Ariel BarnesDear Mediocre Advice,
How does casual dating work? I’m 
newly single and talking to a bunch of 
guys, but I don’t want to hurt anyone.
Dear Friend,
You are not a wizard. You cannot please every-
one and still make yourself happy. Nut-up, and be 
an a--hole to avoid leading people on. Make it clear you’re not ready for anything serious. The trick is to do it early. It will be easier than waiting three months when a guy who swears you two are soulmates is crying at your door at 4 a.m. Also, it’s OK to keep se-crets. You don’t have to tell the guy you want to go on a date with that you boned someone last weekend. 
You should not feel guilty about it. Dear Mediocre Advice,
Do you have any sisterly words for a female going 
down on a guy for the first time? 
Dear Friend,
Do you know that feeling when you’ve just watched an hour 
of “Friends” and all of the sudden “The King of Queens” is on? You’re kind of mad and think, “Oh come on! What is this?” That’s what it feels like to give oral for an exhausting amount of time and realize the end is probably not even close. This may happen. There is a misconception about how much time people need to devote to a blowie. Not finishing a blow job doesn’t mean you’re a quitter — you just have stuff to do in the morning. Tap ou,t and move on to something else in the fore-
play book if you feel like you’re about to dislocate your jaw. Dear Mediocre Advice,
I get so aggravated with walking tread-
mill-hoggers at the gym. What’s proper 
etiquette when someone is waiting? 
Dear Friend,
He got to the treadmill first. So, all you 
can do is give him the death stare and hope he feels so uncomfortable he wants to leave. To all the brisk walkers: On a treadmill, you should run so hard, you force farts out of your butt. You should look like a monster — messy hair, a red face, uncontrollably sweat-ing and eye-f--king yourself in the nearest mirror. If you don’t look like a steaming pile 
of crap, then you didn’t work out.THURSDAY, APRIL 11, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

TV Land’s premiere script-
ed comedy “Hot In Cleveland” 
has turned crowds young and old onto what many call this generation’s “The Golden Girls.”
With new episodes pre-
miering June 19 on TV Land, series stars Jane Leeves and the legendary Betty White re-flected in a phone interview about staying hip in today’s 20-something-dominated in-dustry.
With a slew of guest stars 
coming up (including a “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” re-union), the show’s leading ladies seem to be humbly rev-eling in another television suc-cess story.
“[I’ve heard it said that] 
‘Hot in Cleveland’ has done for TV Land what ‘Mad Men’ did for AMC. It sort of branded the network,” Leeves said. “It feels really great for us to keep this genre alive.”
Both actresses are no 
strangers to smash television series, with Leeves featured on “Frasier” and White making a name for herself on “The Mary Tyler Moore Show” and “The Golden Girls.”
When the ladies joined forc-
es with fellow sitcom veterans Valerie Bertinelli and Wendie Malick for “Cleveland,” the foursome immediately bond-ed. But despite the show’s high ratings, it was that initial bond that kept its cast so focused.
“The success of [the] show 
is due to [the] chemistry be-tween the four of us. We just absolutely adore each other,” Leeves said.
Working in the spotlight 
can be tough, but both actress-es stressed keeping things pro-fessional is best for any aspir-ing performer.
“I think that’s a huge ref-
erence that any actress [can have] starting out — to show up knowing what you’re do-
ing and al-ways being profession-
al,” Leeves said.
Even  
w h e n keeping  things pro-fessional, 
the actresses still make time for fun — especially with the opposite sex.
While Leeves gushed 
about guest star George Engel — “We’re all desperately in love” — White commented on her late night appearances on Craig Ferguson’s show — “He is absolutely, totally crazy.” And although White says she’s “not looking for [a male lover] in real life,” she hopes her character, Elka, gets a compan-ion on the show.
Even though she has been 
in the business for almost sev-en decades, White isn’t tired of the limelight — or comedy — just yet.
“It’s the best thing in the 
world. You never want it to go away,” White said. “You can’t get rid of me. Why should I get rid of something I enjoy so much?” Girl talk with ‘Hot In 
Cleveland’ stars Betty White, Jane Leeves

Carol Rosado carefully maneu-
vers a bevy of toppings onto her 
spoon overflowing with ice cream. 
The lychee jellies slime over 
her tongue. Small white mochi bits stick to the 21-year-old biology ju-nior’s teeth long after the smooth red bean ice cream dissolves in her mouth. The rich, sweet red beans skii down the ice cream mountain, falling heavy and thick against the light, refreshing layer of the taro-flavored snow.
That’s right, snow.Hiro Asian Sandwich Bistro is 
giving customers the opportunity to order their very own rendition of snow, presented as the Snow Bowl.
A confectionary winter wonder-
land of shaved ice akin to desserts from the Philippines, Korea and Taiwan, the Snow Bowl mixes the familiar procedure of choosing top-pings at an ice cream shop with the unfamiliar thinly shaved ice wait-ing at the bottom of the cup.
“With this dessert, it’s a visual 
thing as much as it is a taste thing,” Rosado said. “In Puerto Rico, we 
have shaved ice, but it’s not as smooth. You can tell it’s ice. But this one is closer to ice cream.”
The Far East, 
r e c o m m e n d e d 
by the cashier as the most popular flavor of the recently released Snow Bowl, combines a hearty helping of strawberry and mango chunks, a smattering of lychee jellies and mochi bits, and a dollop of sweet red beans atop a scoop of red bean ice cream, all resting on a sea of taro-flavored “snow” and a rolled wafer.With tax, $4.51 will get the larg-
est small-size cup of snow imagin-able, plus a colorful buffet of top-pings and ice cream.  
The Lover’s Paradise, Tropical 
Splash and Heath Freak options are just as visually appealing as the Far East Snow Bowl.
If you’re in the mood to create 
an original Snow Bowl masterpiece, topping choices include Heath bar pieces, chocolate, strawberry and caramel sauces, strawberries, man-goes, kiwis and much more.
Perhaps it’s the revolving pic-
ture slideshow of hypnotizing, heavily stuffed sandwiches upon entering — or the friendly staff — that creates such an inviting atmo-sphere. But every item presented at Hiro Asian Sandwich Bistro, lo-cated between Bento and Chipotle on Archer Road, says, “Try me im-mediately.” The Snow Bowl is no exception.

TALLAHASSEE — After miss-
ing nearly a month, Richie Martin 
was excited to return in time for the game he had been eying all season.
The freshman hit a double, 
knocked in two runs and showed his defensive versatility as Florida (16-18) took the final game of its sea-son series against No. 7 Florida State (27-6) 4-3 on Tuesday night at Dick Howser Stadium. 
“It was awesome,” Martin said of 
the win. “I’ve been looking forward to this since I was in high school. I was recruited by both schools and ever since committing to Florida, I’ve always wanted to play here be-cause I’ve seen the atmosphere.”
Prior to suffering a broken right 
index finger in a 6-3 win against Mi-ami on March 3, Martin led Florida with 13 hits, ranked third on the team with a .342 batting average and was in the midst of a 10-game hitting streak.
More than five weeks later, Mar-
tin picked up right where he left off.
Trailing 1-0 in the top of the third, 
the Gators loaded the bases with one out after Casey Turgeon walked fol-lowing back-to-back singles from Harrison Bader and Cody Dent. Martin then lofted a ball to deep right field for a sacrifice fly to tie the game.
“I don’t try and hit fly balls, but 
in that situation, I had to,” Martin said. “I was just trying to get under the ball a little.”
Martin gave Florida the lead two innings later.
After Dent reached base on a 
walk and Turgeon singled to ad-vance him to second, Martin poked an 0-1 pitch from Florida State starter Peter Miller over first baseman John Nogowski’s head and into shallow right field. Dent scored as Martin slid into second for his second extra-base hit of the year.
“I was trying to be aggres-
sive with two outs,” Martin said of stretching the hit into a double. “Maybe draw a throw and get the other run. I was just going.”
Since making his return to the 
lineup in Friday’s 7-3 loss at Missis-sippi State, Martin has four hits and three RBI. He’s reached base safely in each of the 16 games he’s started this season.
Martin started the first 12 games 
of the season at shortstop and made just two errors in 50 chances. How-ever, coach Kevin O’Sullivan started him at designated hitter in his first two games back in the lineup. Even though Martin had never played outfield at any level before this sea-son, O’Sullivan put him in center field both Sunday and Tuesday.
“We need to get him out there,” 
O’Sullivan said. “It just frees up the DH spot. … I just didn’t want to freeze up that spot. I want to open it up for somebody else. We’re at a point now where we have to take some chances.”
In his first two outfield appear-
ances, Martin had five putouts and no errors. While the move is not nec-essarily permanent, Martin said he is happy wherever he lines up.
“Only time I’d played center was 
messing around in [batting practice] or back home. I’d take some fly balls out in the outfield,” Martin said. “They’re just sticking me out there. I’ll play wherever they want. I’m just happy to be out there.”
Carmichael resting: When 
O’Sullivan announced UF’s start-ing rotation for last weekend’s series against Mississippi State, one famil-iar name was absent — freshman right-hander Jay Carmichael, who started Florida’s three previous Fri-day games.
“He looked good,” O’Sullivan 
said. “We will kind of take it day by day.”
“I’ll know more [today]. He 
threw 60 feet, 90 feet. It’s just a little soreness. Everything is fine. We’re just being cautious with him.”

Lauren Haeger does not let what hap-
pens in the batter’s box carry into the 
pitching circle.
The sophomore pitcher has only one hit 
in the past four games. Despite going hit-less against USF, she allowed only one run in six innings against the Bulls.
Haeger notched her 11th victory as the 
No. 3 Gators (39-4, 12-3 Southeastern Con-ference) run-ruled the Bulls (32-12, 10-1 Big East) 9-1 on Wednesday night at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium.
The win was the right-hander’s first 
against South Florida since she was out-dueled by USF ace Sara Nevins in the 2012 regular season. Haeger played first base when the Bulls ended the Gators’ season in the NCAA Regionals.
“I’m still a little bitter, I think I’ll for-
ever be bitter,” Haeger said.Haeger channeled her bitterness into a 
strong start, fanning the first two USF bat-ters she faced. 
“During warmups, I was really feeling 
good,” she said.
“When they told me I was pitching, I 
was really excited.”
But Haeger struggled 
in the second inning, giv-ing up a leadoff double to 
USF third baseman Ken-shyra Jackson and allow-ing a run on a single by right fielder Ashli Goff.  After the second, Haeger settled down and allowed 
only two base runners.
“Her tempo was great,” coach Tim Wal-
ton said.
“She threw a lot of strikes, got a lot of 
first-pitch strikes, had them chasing some pitches when she got ahead.”
Florida responded in the bottom half of the second. Freshman Kelsey Stewart got the Gators on the board with an RBI single, and freshman Kirsti Merritt cleared the bases with a two-run triple to give UF a 3-1 lead.
Freshmen continued contributing in 
the third inning. First baseman Taylor Schwarz led off the frame with a double and scored on a bases-loaded walk to left fielder Jessica Damico.
After scoring 16 of 18 runs via homers 
against Mississippi State last weekend, Florida relied on base hits against USF.
For the first time since defeating UCF 
2-1 on April 3, the Gators did not hit a home run.
Even Haeger, who leads the team with 
12 home runs, got into the small-ball ac-tion, dropping down a sacrifice bunt with two runners on in the fifth inning.
“I dropped the bunt down with Lauren 
Haeger, arguably one of our most power-ful hitters,” Walton said.“That’s a message to all 14 of my hitters 
that I’m going to bunt with any one of you in any situation.”
Florida clinched the run-rule victory in 
the sixth inning.
The Gators took a 7-1 lead on a pinch-
hit single by freshman Taylore Fuller, bringing Stewart to the plate with two runners on. 
Stewart slapped a ball to third base, 
and Jackson tried to throw it to shortstop Kourtney Salvarola, who was covering third.
After ball sailed high over Salvarola’s 
head, sophomore Briana Little scored and Fuller followed, ending the game early.
“It’s not the number of hits, it’s not the 
number of walks, it’s not the number of runs,” Walton said. “It’s about being qual-ity, and being able to take advantage of some situations.”
