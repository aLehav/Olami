  The monarch butterﬂ  y wings strapped 
to 11-year-old Ashley Fuller’s back had a span that doubled the width of her frame and reached the top of her head. 
  “I’ve been raising skippers, butter-
ﬂ  ies and moths for nine years now,” said Ashley, of Sebastian, Fla. “I just love the caterpillars and the stages they go through, from cocoon to butterﬂ  y.”
  The Florida Museum of Natural His-
tory’s sixth annual Butterﬂ  yFest spread its wings Saturday, and Ashley was one of the 2,600 attendees that day.
  The free and public family-friendly 
festival was held Saturday and Sunday and featured presentations, activities and crafts that focus on pollinators like butterﬂ  ies, bats, birds and bees. 
  Last year the total attendance count 
for the museum’s signature outreach event was 5,400 while this year it reached 5,229.

  Gainesville’s downtown plaza was decorated with ev-
ery color of the rainbow Saturday.
  The Pride Festival, a celebration of the LGBTQ commu-
nity, took place on Bo Diddley Community Plaza.
  The celebration started with a parade that included a 
ﬂ  oat and antique cars and progressed from a parking lot 
on Northwest Seventh Street and West University Avenue down to the plaza.
  Grand marshals Joy Revels, 51, owner of Dragonﬂ  y 
Graphics, and Aimee Anderson, 35, the company’s mar-keting director and school liaison, led the parade down West University Avenue, promoting pride and their busi-ness for the ﬁ  rst time.
  “It’s sort of a celebration of being free to be who you are 
in the world,” Revels said.
  Revels and Anderson are partners not only in business 
but also in life.
  They said they have been to the festival before and have 
supported it by selling T-shirts used for the celebration.
  “It’s people pride,” Revels said. “Celebrating diversity 
is a huge concept.”
  As grand marshals, the women were the ﬁ  rst to see the 
Occupy Gainesville — or, as they renamed it for the day, Occu-Pride Gainesville — still protesting for the 99 percent in Bo Diddley Community Plaza.
  “We [the LGBTQ community and Occupy Gainesville] 
are on the same team,” Anderson said.
  “This Occupy ‘America’ is revolutionary,” Revels said. 
“In 50 years, we could be celebrating the taking back of our country. I would walk in that.”LGBTQ festival,

  What began as an argument 
between two groups of men at 
a nightclub ended in violence when a man was shot in the head in the early morning Sunday at a city parking garage. 
  The argument began at Plasma 
Lounge, 7 SW Second St., then continued into the parking lot and to the Southwest Downtown Parking Garage.
  The victim, 30-year-old Ar-
trel Dubose, was with a group of three or four men who were argu-ing with another group of three men. Police don’t yet know what the ﬁ  ght was about, said Cpl. An-gelina Valuri, Gainesville Police Department public information ofﬁ  cer. 
  “It became physical when 
the victim’s friend got punched in the face and knocked to the 
ground by some-
one in the other group,” she said. “As the victim was helping his friend up from the ground, he was shot in the head.”
  Dubose, who is from the At-
lanta area, was taken to Shands Hospital after ofﬁ  cers arrived at the scene. His family took him off life support early Sunday after-noon, Valuri said.
  Relatives told police Dubose 
had survived an incident 10 years before in which he was shot in the head and lost an eye because of his injuries.
  Two men have been arrested 
in connection with the Sunday incident: 20-year-old Brandon Brashod Wilson, who is charged with homicide and burglary, and 22-year-old Deron Matthews, who is charged with burglary, Valuri said.
  The burglary charges were due 
to the suspects’ decision to break into a local business or business-es to hide from police following the shooting. 
  One man who may have a ﬁ  rst 
name of Craig is still at large and wanted for questioning, Valuri said. 
  Police determined that Wilson 
ﬁ  red the shots using a semi-auto-matic, .40-caliber handgun that hasn’t been found.

Rajvi Doshi was nervous.
But when the lights came up and 
made the sequins glimmer on her orange-and-blue skirt and blouse, it was time to perform for 950 people. 
Adrenaline set in.“You get over [the nerves] because 
of the pure adrenaline rush,” she said.
Doshi, a member of dance team 
GatoRaas and a 19-year-old nutrition sophomore, was one of about 200 performers at the Indian Student As-sociation’s Diwali Show on Saturday night.
Glow-in-the-dark lights and a 
stage decorated with colored Christ-mas lights paid homage to the Hindu festival of lights, which is officially observed Wednesday.
The show, held at the Phillips Cen-
ter, featured a fashion show, dance groups, singing and a skit woven be-tween dance performances.
Tulsi Patel, the show’s director, 
said the Diwali Show is one of the as-sociation’s biggest annual events be-cause Diwali is an important holiday to Hindus, almost like Christmas. The festival is usually celebrated with family, which she said is difficult to do away from home.
“The show helps us stay grounded 
in our culture,” said Patel, a 20-year-old finance junior. “That’s something we may not always get in college.”
Naomi Abraham, one of the show’s 
MCs, told the audience the show was great because “we can hold onto our culture even though most of us were born here in the United States.” 
The show also featured the Indian 
and American national anthems and hip-hop infusions into Indian dance styles, with the jingle and clink of anklets, bangles and coin-adorned clothing punctuating dancers’ move-ments.
After attending for the fourth-
straight year, Sandra Kerrutt, 21, a microbiology senior, said her favor-ite parts of the show are its color and wide variety of Indian dances. 
For her, the show is nostalgic.“It reminds me of things I used to 
do as a kid but don’t anymore,” she said. “And it serves as a cultural re-minder.”

Members of Punjab Di Asli Pehchaan perform at the Indian Student As-
sociation’s Diwali Show on Saturday night at the Curtis M. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. The group is a competitive team of dancers from around Florida.
 on CAMPUSDiwali Show celebrates Indian culturebut appeals to all genera-
tions. 
The festival’s keynote 
speaker was Naomi Pierce, a Harvard scientist speak-ing about the symbiotic re-lationship between ants and caterpillars, Bright said.
Presentations included a 
talk on Japanese butterflies and moths, Caribbean bats, local hummingbirds and entomophagy — the prac-tice of eating insects.  
In addition to the pre-
sentations, the inside of the museum bustled with 19 tables featuring nonprofit organizations, pollinator costume arts and crafts, a pollinator parade and but-terfly bingo. 
The front lawn of the 
Cultural Plaza had food and merchandise vendors, jugglers and free activities like a sack race and butter -
fly release. 
Jaret Daniels, assistant 
director of exhibits and public programs, said a tra-ditional highlight of the fes-tival is the annual plant sale with more than 120 species of plants. 
“We really try to pro-
mote habitat gardening,” he said. “We want people to understand they can make a significant difference in their own yards by planting wildlife-friendly plants.”
The festival also offered 
activities that charged ad-mission, including the 
Butterfly Rainfor -
est, a pho-tography 
workshop and a behind-the-scenes tour of the McGuire  
Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity.
A common misconcep-
tion, Daniels said, is that because the event is brand-ed “ButterflyFest,“ it’s just about butterflies. 
“If you’re interested in 
nature in general and hav-ing a fun time in the com-munity, this is the place to be.”4, ALLIGATOR §  MONDAY, OCTOBER 24, 2011

Parade on Saturday.
Marines recruiters at festival for first time
A tent away from the “Occu-
Pride Gainesville” camp sat the “Kid 
Pride,” where children could get their faces painted. 
Positioned just beyond the chil-
dren stood the United States Marine Corps tent, a first for the festival.
“We are here to present different 
options to different people,” said Sgt. Daniel Gonzales Jr., 26, at the  Marine Corps tent.
He said the Marines are now able 
to recruit at events like the Pride Parade because of the repeal of the “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell” policy in the U.S. Armed Forces, and there haven’t been any issues since the repeal.
The antique cars were from the 
Flamingo Auto Groups of Orlando and Tampa.
The groups are a part of the Lamb-
da Car Club International, the largest international gay-and-lesbian car club with more than 2,200 members and 30 chapters nationally, according to the club’s website.
Since 2001, the groups have been 
bringing their antique cars to par -
ticipate in the parade, said Gordon Lawyer, 57, a member of the Pride Community Center of North Central Florida.
This year, the cars had multicol-ored streamers attached to them for the parade.
“It’s just like any other social 
population who like to celebrate their culture whether you are lesbian, gay, bi-sexual, transgendered or question-ing,” Lawyer said.
Craig Lowe, mayor of Gainesville 
and open member of the LGBTQ community , said the parade is a “good opportunity to celebrate diver -
sity in Gainesville.”
Lowe said he has been active in 
the festival since it started in 1992.
“The value placed upon equality is 
increasing,” he said. “We’ll see much more emphasis put upon equality in the future.”

WASHINGTON — America’s war in 
Iraq will be over by year’s end and all U.S. 
troops “will definitely be home for the holi-days,” President Barack Obama said Fri-day.
Across eight years, more than 4,400 
members of the military have been killed, and more than 32,000 have been wounded.The final exit date was sealed after 
months of talks between Washington and Baghdad failed to reach agreement on con-ditions for leaving several thousand U.S. troops in Iraq as a training force. 
The U.S. also had been interested in 
keeping a small force to help the Iraqis deal with possible Iranian meddling.
The task now is to speed up the pullout 
of the remaining nearly 40,000 U.S. forces.Some 150 to 200 U.S. 
troops will stay in Iraq, where bombings and oth-er violence still occur, as part of embassy security, the defense attache’s of-
fice and the office of secu-rity cooperation.
Obama, an opponent of 
the war since before he took office, praised the efforts of U.S. troops in Iraq. 
He said American soldiers would leave 
“with their heads held high, proud of their success.”
Friday’s announcement followed the 
president’s announcement about the death of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi.
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have 
cost the U.S. about $1.3 trillion.

And they were off. Runners of all sizes crossed the starting 
line. Some pushed their way toward the front. One stopped to 
pee on the first tree of the course.
Dogs ran alongside their owners Saturday at the 30th-annu-
al Dog Days Run, hosted by UF’s College of Veterinary Medi-cine and the UF student chapter of the American Veterinary Medical Association.
The 5K run and 1-mile Fun Run raised about $10,000 for 
the Global Alliance for Rabies Control and the Alachua County Humane Society, said Megan Manzie, event coordinator.
The event, which took place at Westside Park, included 
awards for contests such as best costume, slowest dog and youngest dog.
UF veterinary student Gretchen Henry , her boyfriend and 
their pharaoh hound, Kesi, wore face paint and dressed as zombies while competing in the 1-mile Fun Run.
Kesi won best costume in a three-way tie with a dog dressed 
as a picnic basket and another dressed as Harry Potter.“The event went fantastically,” said Manzie, who is also 
a second-year student at the veterinary school. “The weather was beautiful. We had a fantastic turnout, and I think people had a great time.”
Manzie said there were 300 competitors — 250 people and 
about 50 dogs.
Emily Snyder, a history sophomore, placed first in the 15- to 
19-year-old (human) females division of the 5K.
She said she enjoyed being around the dogs and people at 
the event.

Today’s question: Do you think all troops will actually 
be withdrawn from Iraq by the end of the year?
20% YES
80% NO
85 TOTAL VOTESFriday’s question: Are you going to the Pride Parade this weekend? Angry Atheist
Should prayer be in 
public school’s mural?
The issue of religion in public schools is messy at best. 
How can public schools refrain from respecting 
a particular establishment of religion while also re-
specting the right of its students to worship freely? 
Public schools, as agents of the government, are bound 
by the same limitations placed on other state institutions by 
the First Amendment.
Originally, the Bill of Rights applied only to Congress, 
but after years of case law, it now applies to state and local governments.  
This issue recently arose in a case out of Rhode Island in 
which a 16-year-old atheist student challenged the display of a mural bearing an obviously religious prayer at her high school. 
Jessica Ahlquist, the student, has taken the school district 
to court in an attempt to get the mural taken down, which she says is “offensive” to non-Christians. 
While the “offensiveness” of the mural is quite subjec-
tive, the fact that the mural hangs in the public school and begins with the phrase “Our Heavenly Father” and ends with “Amen” indicates the school has overstepped its con-stitutional obligations. 
The school has argued that the mural is meant to repre-
sent the history of the school rather than respect a particular religion, given that the banner was presented by the Class of 1963, the first to graduate from the school. 
While representing the history of the school is fine, a cou-
ple of things are problematic about this mural. First, the top of the banner reads “School Prayer,” indicating the prayer is not that of the Class of 1963 but that of the school. If it read “Class Prayer of 1963,” the school might have an argument to preserve its history. 
Second, the attorney representing the city has claimed, 
given the historical significance of the mural, that it is dis-played as a secular, nonreligious artifact.
But as it hangs now, the banner’s religious content does 
violate the First Amendment rights of nonreligious students at this high school. Regardless of the intentions of the school, the display indicates the school is respecting the establish-ment of religion. 
While the complete removal of the prayer from the wall 
might be unnecessary, the school should look into ways of removing any ties between the school and religious affilia-tion. 
A simple answer would be to place a disclaimer at the 
bottom of the mural indicating its origin. 
If the state is going to force compulsory education among 
its younger residents, it should ensure that no beliefs (or lack thereof) are alienated.Education needs comprehensive overhaul
While discussing affirmative action in class recent-
ly, a fellow student said the reason we need poli-cies that give minorities preference in admissions 
to the best institutions of higher learning is because of edu-cational inequality in primary and secondary schools. 
As a society, we have been content with the grossly neg-
ligent behavior of tolerating subpar educational instruc-tion for minorities and the poor. We wait until students are 18 years old to blame lower SAT scores on racism, and then we admit individuals to programs that fit certain cat-egories in the name of diversity. 
It is time we phase out affirmative action policies with 
the most comprehensive overhaul of the educational in-frastructure in this country since desegregation. This over -
haul starts with changing how we view the profession of teaching.
Two generations ago, women were largely restricted to 
select professions if they worked out of the home, and chief among these was teaching. Because of the artificial barri-ers society placed on women, there was a large amount of talent in the teaching profession. As women have gained options besides the traditional roles of nurse and teacher, there are no longer any barriers to prevent talent from leaving this field, and it shows. 
Today, students who choose education as a major are 
drawn from the lower end of the academic distribution in college as measured by SAT and ACT scores. Education is rated, in a recent academic study by Wake Forest, as the easiest of all college majors; the average GPA of educa-tion majors is 3.36. These metrics suggest we are drawing people to the education profession who can’t cut it as en-gineers or scientists at the detriment mostly to disadvan-taged students. 
The reason the stats on those who go into teaching are 
so discouraging is because of how discouraged teachers are when they enter the profession. 
Teachers are treated like industrial-age factory work-
ers, and their unions demand they be treated as such. Be-cause of the push against grading teachers, we have turned teaching into a static profession with little prestige. I think it is critical that every 
facet of teachers’ employment contracts be reevaluated. While it would be a huge mistake to think that teacher ability can be measured by one test such as the FCAT, a holistic evaluation method looking at administra-tion, student and parent feed-back in combination with test 
scores on other nationally normed tests would be a good place to start. 
The tenure review period for teachers must be extend-
ed. Some teachers get tenure in three years, but it takes our professors usually seven years before they can be assured of job security. 
Currently, teachers are paid based on years of experi-
ence and any higher degrees they might have. In an era of devalued degrees and for-profit colleges offering mas-ters programs ad naseum, this is an archaic compensation structure that should be eliminated. 
Worst of all, when all teachers are treated the same and 
there are no incentives for performance, the best teachers will choose to go to the nicest suburbs and teach the rich-est students. It is an implicitly higher form of payment to teach students from better backgrounds, thus making these teaching positions more competitive. 
Minority students growing up in tough neighborhoods 
get teachers who are demoralized and who just try to sur -
vive because the teachers get no support and are paid low wages with no monetary incentives to do their best. Dis-advantaged communities would benefit most of all with increased focus on pay for performance in teaching. 
Affirmative action is just a way to assuage white elites’ 
guilt at creating a system that gives minorities and the poor slim-to-none chance at success with teachers who have no reason to be vested in their students’ academic progress.

In a recent New York Times article, envi-
ronmental journalist Elisabeth Rosenthal asked, “Where did global warming go?” 
It is the question of a confused and frustrated person who was hopeful about climate change mitigation in 2008 but has lately become more pessimistic. In many ways, her feelings echo mine.
Both politicians and the public seem less 
concerned with climate change than they were three years ago, and governmental ac-tion seems unlikely in the near future. While this can partially be attributed to the powerful fossil-fuel lobbying and the economic reces-sion, I think a large part of the problem stems from the way we talk about climate change. Climate scientist and Princeton University professor Robert Socolow addressed this in an essay published last month.
Socolow’s main claim to fame in the cli-
mate world is a 2004 paper that argued that, contrary to popular belief at the time, it was possible to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions for the next 50 years using technologies we already had. Though no technology was suf-ficient on its own, we could achieve this goal if we combined seven technologies. 
Many climate scientists and activists 
greeted this paper with excitement. Here was a precise, doable plan for the next 50 years. Surely the government and the public would take heed. In his recent essay , Socolow mused on why his paper failed to galvanize action. Mainly he sees this as a failure of communi-cation, and I think there is truth to what he says. The current rhetoric is both divisive and alienating. Many skeptics refer to climate ad-vocates (both scientists and activists) as global warming alarmists. Activists, on the other hand, dismiss skeptics as climate deniers and idiots. 
The thing is, both camps are correct. There 
is uncertainty in the science and as a result, climate models predict a variety of possible future scenarios. These scenarios include both extremes — situations where carbon emis-sions do not have much environmental impact (for a while, that is) and situations where the world spirals out of control with a 5-meter sea level rise by 2100, massive drought and flood-ing, human conflict over resources and ulti-mately massive human mortality . More likely is a middle scenario with significant harmful effects that are not of such apocalyptic magni-tudes. The problem is, it is hard to predict ex-actly where the threshold levels are. We know increased carbon dioxide levels will have cer -
tain effects, we just don’t know when exactly those effects will materialize.
Scientists and 
activists seem reti-cent to mention 
uncertainty or that the more stable scenario is possible. They fear that doing so will lead to inaction. But, rather than spurring action, the “alarmist” approach has opened the door for skeptics to poke holes in the story and to accuse climate scientists of lying or distorting the data. A different approach, as proposed by Socolow, would be to present climate change as a risk, rather than as a doomsday prophecy lurking around the corner. In doing so, scien-tists and activists would acknowledge that the scenario painted by skeptics is plausible (in short, at some point, our emissions will catch up with us), thus at least somewhat neutraliz-ing that argument. Climate scientists and activ-ists would seem reasonable and trustworthy rather than extreme. And if we told Ameri-cans that there is a small chance greenhouse gas emissions might have little affect over the next 100 years, an equally small chance that these emissions could be catastrophic, and a big chance that these emissions would cause very severe (but not catastrophic) problems, I think most would rather play it safe. We could get past this stalemate of “he said, she said.”
Part of the problem stems from how we 
talk about the environment more generally . Climate change and environmentalist rheto-ric often pits humans against or outside of the environment. We must “save” the planet. Though dramatic expressions may rouse some, I believe that this strategy is actually alienating to many . No one wants to save the planet — or even cute polar bears — if it is at the expense of oneself or one’s family . No one wants to save the planet by destroying the economy . Skeptics often warn that our focus on climate change distracts attention and re-sources from alleviating world poverty.
But the truth is, we are part of the system, 
and our rhetoric and policy should both re-flect that. Alarmist scenarios are so alarming because of how they affect people and societ-ies, not merely because of how they impact animals or plants. If greenhouse-gas emis-sions continue to rise, the problems of the developing world such as drought, hunger, poverty and conflict will only get worse. It is not us or the environment. It is us and the en-vironment. By saving the planet, we are sav-ing ourselves.

Global warming on backburner due to scare tactics, dramatizationUWire

Our country needs to have a serious conversation about 
restoring fiscal discipline. For that to happen, both sides must leave their talking points at the door — Republi-
cans need to place their oath of office above their pledges to never raise taxes, and Democrats need to be willing to consider proposals that do not disproportionately thump the richest of Americans.
Despite what you may have heard, taxes are not spiraling 
out of control quite the opposite. Last year, federal tax receipts fell to their lowest levels since 1950, now just 14.9 percent of gross domestic product compared to the post-World War II av-erage of 18-to 19-percent. This may not seem like a big drop, but the difference amounts to approximately $560 billion — enough to cut deficits in half or fund annual Social Security and Medicare shortfalls in perpetuity.
There are a few reasons for the drop. Some are structural 
and beyond immediate control, like the collapse of tax revenue when the economy slipped into recession. Others are the result of short-sighted public policy — namely, the Democrats’ exten-sion of the Bush tax cuts and their gradual chipping away at payroll tax rates.
Coupled with a decrease in tax revenue, the spike in federal 
spending — both as a result of automatic stabilizers and dis-cretionary attempts at stimulus — has resulted in some of the largest deficits in years. And while I don’t buy into the dooms-day predictions of those who think soaring levels of debt will push America to the brink of insolvency as it has with Greece and Portugal, there is no doubt that the path we are on is un-sustainable.
The first step should be to revamp our broken tax code. Currently, a dollar made from labor is taxed at a much higher rate than a dollar made from investment, thanks to the egregious carried-interest loop-hole that allows billionaire investors 
like Warren Buffett — and 26.5 percent of households making more than $1 million a year — to get away with paying lower tax rates than secretaries, teachers and police officers.
Progressive taxation is also undermined by payroll taxes. 
Because the portion of taxable income is capped at $106,800, payroll taxes are actually regressive: The rich pay a much smaller share of their overall income in payroll taxes than those in lower income brackets.
The last major problem with our tax code is that corporate 
lobbyists have been able to carve out a whole host of loopholes, allowing the companies they represent to pay little to nothing in taxes. In 2008, Goldman Sachs paid only 1.1 percent of its in-come in taxes, even though it earned a profit of $2.3 billion. The following year, Chevron received a $19-million refund from the Internal Revenue Service despite profits exceeding $10 billion. Last year, Bank of America received a $1.9-billion tax refund despite taking home $4.4 billion in profits.
I’m more than happy to see American companies make tons 
of money — that’s one of the great things about capitalism. But if companies want the rights of personhood, when it comes to protections under the law, then they should bear the respon-sibilities of personhood as well. Why should corporations be exempt from paying the same level of taxes as the rest of us?
Instead of distinguishing between different income types — 
income from labor, income from capital gains and corporate income — I would treat them all equally. All realized income above approximately $50,000 (the exact number should de-pend on relative costs of living) should be taxed at the flat rate of 25 percent without exceptions or deductions. This means Warren Buffett would pay the same rate on the last dollar of his considerable income as I would pay on the first dollar of mine above $50,000.
To put these numbers into perspective, a middle-class fam-
ily making $75,000 a year would be responsible for paying $6,250 in taxes — about 8.3 percent of its total income. After the loopholes have been removed, wealthy individuals would end up paying no more than 25 percent of their total income in federal taxes, a much lower rate than is seen in any other de-veloped country with the exceptions of Andorra, Monaco and Switzerland.
The benefits of this tax code cannot be overstated. It would 
be simple without being simplistic and progressive without be-ing unfair. Not only would it save millions of man-hours spent filling out complicated tax forms and reduce the labor need for IRS agents, this plan would increase revenues back to approxi-mately 19 percent of GDP — the upper end of historical aver -
ages — once exempted income is taken into account.
By itself, adjusting the tax code so that it is more progres-
sive — and less susceptible to lobbyist-driven loopholes — will not eliminate soaring budget deficits. However, it will provide a strong foundation for reviving the middle class, kick-starting demand and restoring our economy’s footing so that it will once again be the envy of the world.

Campaign Check
A promise the commissioner 
can legally fulfill
A lot of promises get tossed around during election 
season, but how many of them are legitimate? To find that 
out, we fact-checked promises made by the six At-Large 1 candidates for the Gainesville City Commission. 
We’ll do another round of fact-checking before elections 
are over. Here is the first round of campaign promises.Sources: Thomas Hawkins, Gainesville city commissioner; Jeanna Mastrodicasa, 
Gainesville city commissioner; Maj. Brad Barber, public information officer for UF Police Department; Scott Fox, director of UF Transportation and Parking Services; Steve Orlando, UF spokesmanCampaign Check

 Harold Saive
Promise is beyond the city’s 
power and can’t be fulfilled by a city commissionerPartially possible promise
?Unsure of what the candidate is promising
James Ingle and Dejeon Cain
Promise: To allow bars and clubs to stay open until 4 a.m. 
but require they stop serving alcohol at the current time of 
2 a.m., also known as soft closing.Reason: It’s within the city’s power to change this rule. 
Bars and clubs have to close at 2 a.m. The City Commis-sion could change this rule by changing the code of ordi-nances. Lauren Poe
Promise: To continue to work toward a first-response center 
for domestic- and child-abuse victims.Reason: Poe laid the groundwork for this project during his time on the City Commission as a District 2 commissioner, and it’s within the city’s power to continue this project.
Darlene Pifalo
Promise: To ask questions about the Gainesville Regional 
Utilities biomass plan to see how it will affect residents.Reason: Any commissioner can ask questions, but this is a vague promise.Donna Lutz
Promise: To look into prohibiting UF freshmen and sopho -
mores from bringing cars to campus in order to decrease transportation problems in the city.Reason: The city doesn’t control that. UF does.
?Harold Saive
Promise: To consolidate the Gainesville City Commission 
with the Alachua County Commission.Reason: It depends how far Saive wants to take the consolidation. The City Commission would be able to make an arrangement with the County Commission to consolidate services such as fire departments. But the City Commission wouldn’t be able to disband itself and completely give power over to the county. A higher legis-lative body would have to decide that.James Ingle
Promise: To initiate a local hiring preference to ensure 
that city projects employ city residents.
Reason:  The city has to obey the state Consultants’ 
Competitive Negotiation Act of 1973, which promotes fair competition without favoritism for architects, en-gineers, surveyors and other professions named in the act. Because of the act, a city can’t pass anything that states Gainesville contractors will get automatic first preference above all other contractors. However, commissioners have a certain amount of wiggle room that they can use to advocate that a city business de-serves to be hired for a project. Commissioner Thom-as Hawkins said commissioners often push for local businesses within the legal parameters but said more can always be done.
Dejeon Cain
Promise: To let other utilities companies do business in Gainesville, such as Clay Electric, so residents will have more options than just Gainesville Regional Utilities.Reason: Outside City Commission jurisdiction. The Florida Public Service Commission sets the territories for municipal utilities companies for water, electricity and other services. The Florida Public Service Commission doesn’t allow for overlap, so other companies can’t encroach on Gainesville Regional Utilities’ area due to state law.Dejeon Cain
Promise: To expand Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol (SNAP) so vans will pick up and drop off students on Archer Road.Reason: The UF Police Department runs SNAP, so UF gets to decide where the vans run. Not the city.
Donna Lutz and Darlene Pifalo
Promise: To extend citizen comment to give people more 
than three minutes to speak.
Reason: City commissioners could pass a resolution.

Quickly rising, Mary Wise got vocal.
Her team, in the midst of a 22-set win-
ning streak, was watching things snow-ball out of control, falling behind Missis-sippi State by eight points in the second set of Sunday‘s game. 
What came next was much different.The Gators (17-3, 10-1 Southeastern 
Conference) took the following eight points en route to a second-set victory and an eighth consecutive straight-set win (25-23, 25-18, 25-18)
“In set two, it was two different 
teams,” Wise said. “A lot of credit to Kristy Jaeckel.”
Florida’s senior outside hitter went on 
a serving tear, stepping behind the end line seven times in a row and launching a potent UF offensive attack.
Her serves opened the way for junior 
right-side hitter Tangerine Wiggs and senior middle blocker Cassandra Ander -
son, both of whom had strong perfor -
mances Sunday, especially in the second set.
“Kristy’s serving run really set it off 
for us,” Wiggs said. “When you’re down that much, you can’t really think about it in the big picture.”
Wiggs and Anderson combined to hit 
.734 in the second set, with eight of the team’s 13 kills. Anderson also added two of her four blocks during that set.
As they have at times during this cur -
rent winning streak, the Gators started slow, battling back and forth with an overmatched opponent for a large por -
tion of the day. 
Leading the SEC in both hitting per -
centage and opponent hitting percent-age, the Gators were out-hit .286 to .250 in the first set. Paired with Wednesday’s third set against South Carolina, it was the first time Florida was out-hit in back-to-back sets since late September.
“We weren’t real good at defending against their left-side hitters, but part of that was how good their left-side hitters were,” Wise said. 
The Gators’ final team hitting percent-age of .304 was their lowest since Sept. 30 against Auburn.
While Jaeckel’s serving was a key

Although a Gator played in each of the quar -
terfinal games Sunday at the USTA/ITA South-
east Regional Championships, only junior Lauren Embree will make a trip to the finals Monday after back-to-back wins in the quarterfinals and semi-finals.
Embree was in the middle of the second game 
of her morning match at the Ring Tennis Complex against Georgia’s Lauren Herring when Herring fell to the ground clutching her left ankle. Al-though Herring returned to play , she only lasted one rally before retiring and meeting Embree at the net to send Florida’s No. 1 seed to the semifi-nals with a 2-0 win.
“It started yesterday against (Ecaterina) Vase-
nia from South Florida,” UF coach Roland Thorn-
qvist said. “[Embree] hit the ball marvelously , and she played well again [Sunday]. She played smart when she 
had to, and overall I feel really good. This is ex-actly what she needed.”
Embree’s pace and volleys have been key to 
her success this weekend, which continued with a straight-set 6-4, 6-2 victory against No. 3 seed Jil-lian O’Neill of Georgia Tech.
“I played a lot better as the time went on, and 
I played a pretty good player this afternoon,” Em-bree said. “I had to play well in order to win.”
Sophomore Sofie Oyen also reached the semi-
finals after starting her day with a come-from-behind 2-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory against Miami’s Anna Bartenstein, the tournament’s No. 2 seed. 
Although Oyen then fell to fourth-seeded 
Chelsey Gullickson from Georgia in straight sets, 1-6, 1-6, Thornqvist said he has seen a lot of im-provement in the Leopoldsburg, Belgium native’s forehand and confidence since the start of this sea-son.
“It was nice to see Sofie buckle down and grind Embree lone

On Senior Day, coach Becky 
Burleigh’s decision to give one 
senior a chance to shine proved costly.
In the 30th minute Sunday, 
LSU keeper Mo Isom cleared the ball toward midfield. Midfielder Natalie Martineau controlled the ball and played it up to Tigers leading scorer Taryne Boudreau, who blasted a shot from 30 yards out, over the outstretched arms of 5-foot-6 Florida senior keeper Brooke Chancey.
“We gave up a bad goal,” Bur -
leigh said.
No. 13 Florida (14-5, 7-3 South-eastern Confer -
ence) was unable to come back, losing 1-0 to LSU (12-6-1, 7-3 SEC) at Pressly Sta-dium.
The Gators’ 
coach gave 
Chancey the start ahead of fresh-man Taylor Burke, whose play earned her the majority of the time in net during conference play. Chancey came in with just two SEC appearances on the season.
The senior’s last action was on 
Oct. 9 against Alabama, a game in which she started but was re-placed in favor of Burke after the first half, when she allowed a goal in the 22nd minute. 
Burke had a goals against av-
erage of .91 prior the game, com-pared to 1.17 for Chancey.
Against LSU, Chancey was 
once again pulled at halftime and replaced with the 6-foot-1 Burke, who was not forced to make a save in the second half. Burleigh

“We were not planning on mak-

With the Tigers a game behind 
the Gators in the standings entering Sunday, and South Carolina (14-5, 8-2 SEC) coming to Gainesville on Friday for the regular-season fina-le, Florida had control of its path to the SEC regular-season title. But that changed with Sunday’s loss — the first ever to LSU — and now Friday’s matchup with the SEC-leading Gamecocks is a must-win.
Burke went untested, because 
for the second time in their last three games the Gators controlled the run of play but failed to finish on numerous scoring chances. 
In a span of six minutes follow-
ing the Boudreau goal, Florida had three corner kicks and six shots. UF finished the second half with 10 shots while LSU had just two.
Burleigh said the Gators played 
well in the first half but were un-able to complete their chances with good final passes once they were within six yards of the net.
The Tigers bunkered down in 
the second half, dropping several players back to not give the Gators space to create, but Burleigh said the conservative defense was not an excuse for the lack of offensive results.
“It’s not like we have not seen 
that from half the SEC schedule,” Burleigh said. “It’s not something we are not prepared to deal with. Did we do a good job of dealing with it in the second half? Abso-lutely not.”
The Gators’ leading scorer, for -
ward Erika Tymrak, said the of-fense has to find its rhythm as the team prepares for the Gamecocks.
“We didn’t finish, and it has to 
be fixed,” Tymrak said, “and it has to be worked on in practice this week.”
ingredient in the second set, Sunday marked the first time since 
Sept. 2 that she did not register double-digit kills. 
Typically known as a power team, Florida resorted to more 
touch-oriented kills against Mississippi State (10-11, 5-7 SEC). An-derson was one player who took the focus on efficiency to heart.
“We definitely work on that a lot more in practice, not just 
blowing the ball out of bounds and giving them points,” she said.
Digs continued to be an area of improvement for the Gators as 
well. Jaeckel, Madison Monserez and Taylor Unroe each recorded 10 digs against the Bulldogs, contributing to a team total of 47.
For Florida, Sunday’s game came after two days of light prac-
tice in which the team focused more on quality than quantity in the wake of a draining road stretch. Wiggs said the reduced work-load helped the team after a grueling week. 
“It was so comforting that [the coaches] do listen to us,” Wiggs 
said. “It just shows that your voice does matter.” MONDAY, OCTOBER 24, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 15

into play, and then be creative when the opportunity sort of arose,” Thornqvist said. “Sometimes she tries to be too creative, sort of out of left field, and I think she’s cor -
rected that this weekend.”
Gullickson, who won the 2010 
NCAA singles championship, also handed the Gators a loss with her doubles partner Lilly Kimbell on Sunday morning, as the pair de-feated Florida’s Caroline Hitimana and Olivia Janowicz 8-5.
Embree is set to face Gullickson today in the finals at 10 a.m., but it won’t be the first time the two have faced off in Gainesville.
