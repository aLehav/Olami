Despite a shaky economic atmosphere 
and state funding that remains “anemic,” 
the state of the university is strong, UF President Bernie Machen assured faculty during his State of the University address Thursday.
“Someone once said. . . summer is when 
laziness ﬁ  nds respectability,” Machen said.
But not for Gators. Over the summer, 
UF students and alumni broke records at the Olympics, UF researchers helped dis-cover the Higgs boson particle and the university’s research grants totaled $644.4 million at the end of the ﬁ  scal year.
Summer also marked the 150th anniver-
sary of the Morrill Land Grant Act, signed in 1862, which laid the foundation for UF, Machen said. It sought to provide access to a broad education and promote state and national progress.
“Access is something the university is 
doing quite well,” he said.
Rising tuition and student debt are 
threats to those tenets, Machen said. De-spite that, UF has managed to keep its tuition 31 percent below the national av-erage, and 61 percent of graduates in the class of 2010 had no debt.
Machen said his successor would have a 
lot to look forward to.
Of his planned departure from UF, he 
said, “I’m not ready to dwell on that end-ing yet.”

Alligators may love to nap in the sun, but 
Gators need to take care not to overheat in 
The Swamp.
The temperatures during Saturday’s foot-
ball game are predicted to be about 90 de-grees, and UF wants to make sure students and fans stay safe. The conditions inside the stadium  — and under the September sun — can cause heat exhaustion, dehydration and heat stroke.
“Slather yourself with sunscreen,” said 
Catherine Seemann, marketing coordinator at the Student Health Care Center. “You’re going to want to take in a quart of water an hour.”
She said students can also drink Gatorade, 
diluted fruit juices or ﬂ  avored water to rehy-drate. Eating fruits and vegetables like water-melon or celery can help as well.
Anyone consuming alcohol should es-
pecially monitor his or her intake, Seemann said.
“The best thing to do is limit the number of 
alcoholic beverages you’re having and make sure you are taking an appropriate amount of water and staying out of the sun,” Seemann said.
During last year’s 3:30 p.m. game against 
the University of Tennessee, about 20 people were treated for heat-related illnesses, said Bryan Flood, director of operations at the Uni-versity Athletic Association.
Dance freshman Jean Shuman, 18, said 
she’s taking precautions to avoid having heat-related health problems. Though she won’t be taking water to the game, she plans on wear-ing sunscreen and an airy T-shirt.
But 24-year-old architecture senior Shawn 
Crews does not intend on wearing sunscreen.Gators should 
beware heat-related illness on gameday
� THE HELICOPTER LEFT TO HELP

There was a Black Hawk down on Fla-
vet Field on Thursday afternoon.
The UF Army ROTC had a demonstra-
tion for new cadets with various assault 
weapons, Humvees and a helicopter full of medevac soldiers.
The group of about 115 students 
whipped out phones and took pictures before the Black Hawk crew left to help victims of Hurricane Isaac.
But there were still plenty of toys to 
gawk at, and 23-year-old criminal justice senior Chris Van Aken was eager to show them off.
“This is a fully automatic, belt-fed, 40 
mm grenade launcher,” Van Aken said, grinning and pointing to a thigh-high military machine on a tripod. “It’s a dev-astating weapon.”
Another table displayed about 10 au-
tomatic weapons, including a gun with a special attachment that allows it to shoot both bullets and grenades.
New cadets took their contracting 
oath, in which they swear to honor their contracts with the military and to serve their country.
“This is the beginning of their military 
career,” said Heather Seidl, a 26-year-old health care management senior.

Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney waves at the Republi-
can National Convention at the Tampa Bay Times Forum on Thursday.
MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Staff Writer
Katy Melchiorre knows she’s 
outnumbered on UF’s campus.
She and other student Re-
publicans are reminded when 
they set up their red banner by the Reitz Union or when they pass out information about the Republican Party’s platform. Sometimes, they’re met with an-ger, but usually they’re ignored. After all, she said, UF is known for being orange and — well — blue.
With election season near -
ing, she and other Republican student leaders are preparing for a political fight on and off campus. And with their groups fueled with excitement from the Republican National Conven-tion, they said they’re preparing for an “uphill battle.”
“We’re definitely outnum-
bered by Democrats on this campus,” said Melchiorre, chair of UF’s College Republicans. “In 2008, it made it difficult, in my opinion, to really let our mes-sage sink in with students.”
Aside from the stereotype 
that college students are liberal, election data shows that on-cam-pus voters largely leaned toward the Democratic Party in the past election cycle. In the 2008 presi-dential election, the Reitz Union saw 3,923 votes cast. Of that, 70.14 percent were for Barack Obama, and 27.84 percent were for John McCain.
Bryan Griffin, a 24-year-old 
UF law student and volunteer at the RNC, said he saw a few Gators at the convention but saw a steady flow of students from all over the U.S.
“Students realize this mes-
sage is the message of the fu-ture,” he said. “And it’s going to be on us.”
As UF’s Democratic organiza-
tions gear up for the Democratic National Convention, Republi-can students are reveling in the political high of the RNC, espe-cially after Republican presiden-tial candidate Mitt Romney’s speech Thursday.
“It was just a good time to be 
a Republican,” said Frank Moeh-rle, chair of Gators for Romney.
The 21-year-old UF political 
science senior said he feels the struggle to get student voters to pay attention to their message but said his party is growing stronger and stronger in Flori-da.
He said they now have more 
than 40 offices in the state, in-cluding the major cities, dedicat-ed to getting voters to the polls for the Republican ticket.
Griffin said Alachua County 
is starting to see more and more Republican influence within its government. City Commis-sioner Todd Chase, a Repub-lican, joined the all-Democrat dias in 2011. Republican Susan Baird was elected to the Alachua County Commission after the 2010 race.
However, Moehrle said he’s 
aiming for a 40 percent Republi-can turnout on campus. He can’t turn the tide, but he said he can fight it. He said he’s had his Romney fliers torn up in his face enough times to realize that.
Regardless of what happens 
with the presidential election on campus, he said, his focus is on a larger prize.
“I don’t know if we’ll neces-
sarily win on campus,” Moehrle said. “I feel confident that we will win the state in Novem-ber.”

UF Republicans optimistic after RNC
� IT’S THE FIRST UNIVERSITY 
IN FLORIDA TO DO SO. 
SAMANTHA SHAVELL

UF is one step closer to reducing 
its carbon footprint.
The university announced 
Wednesday its partnership with 
ASI Campus Laundry Solutions and Neutral Gator to create carbon-neu-tral laundry operations on campus.ASI is offsetting carbon emissions 
produced by laundry machines in all of UF’s residence halls, said Lau-rel Nesbit, a program assistant in the Office of Sustainability.
Neutral Gator is a nonprofit or -
ganization that focuses on reducing effects from carbon emission by cre-ating offsets. According to its web-site, a carbon offset is a credit from a project resulting in less carbon diox-ide than would regularly occur.
Executive Director Jacob Cravey 
said Neutral Gator makes offsets possible by reducing energy con-sumption in Gainesville’s low-
income houses. 
The efforts in-clude upgrad-ing showerheads and lightbulbs to more energy-effi-cient alternatives. V olunteers also plant trees native to Florida to cap-
ture carbon dioxide.
Cravey said Neutral Gator planted about 10,000 trees last year, which created the carbon offsets it then sold. ASI is offsetting 754,884 kilowatt-hours of electricity and nat-ural gas and about 3,774,000 gallons of water to total 488 tons of carbon emissions through its national cor -
porate offset program Carbon Les, according to the press release.
ASI Executive Vice President Da-
vid Drake said UF is the first univer -
sity the company has partnered with for this program. UF is also the first university in Florida to have carbon-neutral laundry operations, he said.
“UF has a goal to be carbon-neu-
tral by 2025,” Nesbit said. “This is an important step.”
UF’s athletic association is al-
ready carbon-neutral, she said.
Neutral Gator has been provid-
ing offsets to Gator Athletics for the last five years, Cravey said.
“We continue to push the enve-
lope at a national level,” he said.

chair of Gators for Romneythe ROTC’s three clubs: the Gator 
Guard Drill Team, the Raiders and Ranger Challenge.
Although each club is physically 
demanding, the three groups are unrelated in their goals.
The Raiders prepares cadets 
for tactical missions, and the Gator Guard practices drill routines to use in ceremonies.
The Ranger Challenge is the 
Army ROTC’s varsity sport, though it’s far different from anything with a scoreboard.
It features a series of events such 
as orienteering, where teams use land navigation skills to find 40 checkpoints over a 4-square-mile course. Another task is to build a bridge using a rope to cross a 40-foot water obstacle.
While the clubs on display are 
rigorous, the weekly lab ROTC stu-dents take as a part of their academ-ic schedule can be just as intense.
Patrick Murphy , a 22-year-old 
English and criminology senior, said one day he and about 18 ROTC classmates were running a patrol on an area in the woods for training.
They began to clean up the prac-
tice site when one of the members found a backpack.
Their instructor had planted it 
there.“He told us there was an invis-
ible IED [improvised explosive de-vice] in there, and eight of us died,” Murphy said. “The other 10 of us had to carry them all the way back to the assembly area.”

“Baseball hats are the only 
sunscreen I wear,” he said.
Whether students are cau-
tious or not, Flood said there 
will be numerous misting stations and first-aid loca-tions inside Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
Handheld fans and small 
cooling towels will be dis-tributed before the game for free.
Flood said people who 
wish to leave The Swamp to cool off can go to the air-conditioned Stephen C. O’Connell Center, where the game will be playing on large video screens. 
Gate 1 will be open for 
fans wanting to escape the heat.According to information 
from the Student Health Care Center, signs of dehydration include:
- dry, sticky mouth- dizziness- headaches- sunken eyesSymptoms of heat exhaus-
tion include:
- fatigue- nausea- vomiting- clammy, pale skin- rapid pulse
If you experience any of 
the above, sit down in the 
shade and drink cool liquids. If the symptoms continue, seek immediate medical at-tention.4, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, AUGUST 31, 2012

Reform Judaism magazine re-
cently ranked UF as the American 
public university with the largest undergraduate Jewish population. UF has 6,500 Jewish students, which is 17 percent of the Student Body, ac-cording to the magazine.
Despite these numbers, UF 
doesn’t cancel classes on Jewish hol-idays, a practice that inconveniences some students and upsets others. UF’s academic calendar does not recognize any religious holidays, though some major Christian holi-days fall during term breaks.
Giving students off for Jewish 
holidays isn’t simple, because not everyone celebrates every holiday on the Jewish calendar, said Jack Kugelmass, director of UF’s Jewish Studies program.  
“The solution is let students take 
the holidays they want to take and have faculty be sensitive to those days,” he said.  Chelsea Graubert, a visual art 
studies junior, said she gives pro-fessors advance notice of her obser -
vance but worries the scheduling won’t work.  
The 20-year-old said it would 
make sense for UF to cancel classes on several Jewish holidays.
“We get other major holidays off, 
so I don’t see what the difference is,” Graubert said.  
Economics junior Deborah 
Abrams, 20, said she and her Jewish friends have had to complain to get some of their professors to resched-ule important tests.
Last week, Provost Joseph Glov-
er sent an email reminding colleges that students and faculty must work together to accommodate holy days. But students need to inform profes-sors of conflicts.
Executive Director and CEO of 
UF Hillel Keith Dvorchik said giv-ing students Jewish holidays off is complicated because other religious groups might ask for their holidays to be recognized.
Over the years, some Jewish stu-
dents and parents have complained to him about not getting the holi-days off.
A student’s parents once argued 
the university would never hold classes on Easter Sunday . Dvorchik agreed.  
“First of all, you’re right, because 
it’s a Sunday,” he told them.

The UF Supreme Court unanimously 
approved a referendum that would ask 
students whether or not they think UF should move forward in forcing publica-tions to be distributed out of university-owned racks.
The referendum, brought to the Su-
preme Court by Sen. David Bradshaw, would need 500 student signatures by Tuesday for the Supreme Court to de-mand the supervisor of elections to in-clude the referendum on the October ballot, said Chief Justice Matt Michel. 
UF’s administration wants all publi-
cations on campus to be placed in black, modular racks. This controversial move would cause problems for The Indepen-dent Florida Alligator, which uses its or -
ange racks to attract readers.Bradshaw said the administration 
made the decision due to issues in safety , security, sustainability and aesthetics.
Some justices were concerned about 
whether the referendum would still be 
relevant by elections.
Justice Alex An-
drade said should the situation with the 
newsracks change, the Supreme Court would need to recon-vene and amend the referendum’s word-ing to make it still ap-
plicable for voting.
He said the Alligator is important to 
students, especially when it comes to reporting about Student Government elections.

University Police are investigating an 
incident in which a man had a gun inside 
a Shands at UF parking garage Thursday afternoon.
Police detained one man and were look-

Just before 2 p.m. Thursday, UPD re-
sponded to a call at Garage 10 on the cor -
ner of Archer Road and Newell Drive, ac-cording to a UPD press release.
Shortly after, UF sent out an alert to stu-
dents saying there was an armed man in the parking garage. Several messages fol-lowed clarifying the scenario and giving a brief description of one person involved.
When police arrived, officers were told that two men and a woman were arguing on the second floor of the garage.
A witness, according to the release, told 
police that during the argument, one of the men pulled out a handgun.
Officers responded and detained one of 
the suspects for questioning. The woman and the armed man fled from the scene, said UPD Capt. Jeff Holcomb.
There were no reported injuries, accord-
ing to a UF alert.
At this point, police are interviewing 
the man they detained to ask him about the other people involved, Holcomb said.
At about 3:50 p.m., the university sent 
out an alert saying that officers had cleared the scene.
If you have any information, please con-
tact Capt. Jeff Holcomb at 352-273-3301 or UPD at 352-392-1111.

Gainesville Police arrested 
a man accused of child abuse 
after an injured toddler ar -
rived at the emergency room.
Police charged Dallis Bran-
don Young, 22, of 1425 SW 42nd St., with aggravated child abuse early Thursday, accord-ing to a GPD arrest report.
At about 2 a.m. Thursday, 
police responded to a call at Pediatric Emergency Room at Shands at UF to assist the Flor -
ida Department of Children and Families in a child abuse case, police said.
A 23-month-old toddler 
was brought to the emergency room with a fractured hip and heavy bleeding on her chest and face, according to the re-port.
Young, a dietary technician 
at the Gainesville Health Care Center and the toddler’s step-father, told medical staff that the child fell from a couch, ac-cording to the report.
The staff knew Young 
had lied to them, because the child’s injuries did not match Young’s story.
Young changed his story 
several times when he talked to police. Officers then took him to the GPD Criminal In-vestigation Division for ques-tioning.
Meanwhile, emergency 
room staff performed surgery on the child, police said.After being questioned 
for about two hours, Young told detectives his previous four stories were false and ex-plained what had happened.
On Wednesday evening, 
Young left the child alone in the kitchen for about 10 min-utes.
While he was out of the 
kitchen, the toddler poured a box of infant cereal onto the ground near the kitchen table.
According to the report, 
when Young got back, he lost his 
temper and threw the child about 7 feet from the kitchen onto the liv-
ing room couch.
The child landed between 
the couch and an ottoman. Young walked over and pushed the child down in the space between the two pieces of furniture, which broke the toddler’s left hip, according to the report.
After his arrest, Young told 
police he was sorry about what had happened and wanted to get help for his anger problem, according to the report.
Police booked Young into 
Alachua County Jail at 2:44 a.m. Thursday. As of press time, Young remained in jail with a bond set at $5,000.

LOS ANGELES — Jack Wyard is 92 and sees no rea-
son to surrender his car keys, not to mention the freedom 
he has to get up and go anywhere he wants, whenever he wants.
After all, he said, two years ago he got a perfect score 
on his written test to renew his license.
“I don’t know what to suggest for anyone else, but 
I’m still comfortable on the highway, and I enjoy driv-ing,” the retired sales manager from Los Angeles said Thursday.
A day earlier, a 100-year-old man who was attempt-
ing to back his Cadillac out of a grocery store parking lot struck and injured 14 people, 11 of them children. Three children remained hospitalized Thursday, police said.
The accident in front of a South Los Angeles elemen-
tary school where children had lined up to buy after-school treats brought up a debate over how old is too old to keep driving.
Is it 80? Or 90? And should anyone past 100 be al-
lowed behind the wheel?
With the American Automobile Association report-
ing that 10,000 Americans are turning 65 every day, it’s a debate that will only intensify in coming years.
“I don’t think there should be a set age because peo-
ple age differently ,” said Ruth Nadel, 98, who was in her mid-80s when she decided it was time to hand over the keys to someone else.Crash injures 11 children, rekindles

“I don’t know what to suggest for anyone

to the UF Performing Arts performances?Charlie Crist among last of dying breed
In an op-ed published last Sunday in the Tampa Bay 
Times, Charlie Crist, former Republican governor of Flor-ida, sang President Barack Obama’s praises and endorsed 
him for re-election this year against Mitt Romney.
Although this is not particularly surprising for the one-
time moderate Republican, it is yet another example of how moderates and centrists are being systematically cast out of the GOP in favor of more extreme, if not outright fringe, ﬁ  g-ures.
Crist governed as a moderate for one term and then de-
cided to run for senator following Mel Martinez’s departure in 2009.
After losing in the Republican primary to Tea Party hero 
Marco Rubio, he changed his party afﬁ  liation to independent and ran in the 2010 general election against Rubio and Dem-ocrat Kendrick Meek, effectively splitting the Democratic vote and helping pave the way for a Rubio victory. Crist has remained an independent since then.
In this age of hyperpartisanship and intense political 
polarization, Crist’s apparent conversion seems like a thing of fantasy, a storybook anecdote of a nostalgic time when it didn’t appear that every member of the Republican Party wanted to require pregnant rape victims to bear their attack-ers’ children or give greed-driven oil companies free rein to blacken our waters and shores.
But it isn’t really Charlie Crist who changed that much.Rather, it is Crist’s party that has drifted so far to the right 
on so many issues that he has instead joined a club consisting of the likes of Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Senator Dick Lugar (R-IN) and Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME).
This club consists of the moderate Republicans who may 
have supported an Obama-backed policy at one point or an-other.
You know — soulless turncoat stuff.By now, this brand is a critically endangered species, tee-
tering on the edge of extinction by the asteroid impact that was the Tea Party movement.
Regrettably, this wipeout of the moderates has brought a 
surge in far right extremism, a barrage of rhetoric and legisla-tion that undermines our democracy , our economy and our most basic rights.
For those Republicans who 
dare defy this trend, the prize is heated criticism from Fox News or, better yet, a nice primary chal-lenge.
Take the economic crisis of 
2008, directly caused by the greed and irresponsibility of Wall Street aided by widespread deregula-
tion: Charlie Crist spoke very highly of President Obama’s stimulus bill as it was being touted by the administration. 
Or the recent wave in statewide voter ID laws, meant to 
gain unfair advantage for Republicans by suppressing the vote for minorities, seniors and students; Crist has come out against these new laws. 
The result is ostracism from the GOP to the point that 
Crist will actually be speaking at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., next week. 
Some may argue, quite fairly, that Crist is simply a wishy-
washy opportunist, quick to exploit the mass repugnance caused by the vitriolic gridlock plaguing our current political system.
This is highly plausible.After all, Crist has never been a progressive by any means, 
and on many issues, like gun rights and marriage equality , he has been rather in lockstep with his former party.
Still, there is certainly something to say about a politician 
unafraid to question or even directly oppose policy positions sacred to his own party, a phenomenon not often seen.
If Crist truly does believe in the positions he espouses, 
then it shouldn’t be considered “opportunistic” if he gains any political advantage as a result.
It would simply mean that he has chosen to distance him-
self from ideas with which he disagrees and embrace those he supports.
Maybe this is asking for too much.  Moises Reyes is a journalism graduate student at UF. His

FINALLY we give a well-someone-heard-our-prayers 
LAUREL  to the “Jersey Shore” producers. They’ve merciful-
ly decided to cancel the series once this season ends, because, 
like the saying goes, all good things have to come to an end — but only after intense suffering.
Don’t Google this, just trust us: Courtney Stodden (the girl 
who married a “LOST” actor when she was 16 and he was 51 and tweets things like “Off to run my productive-fulﬁ  lled errands under the humid sky, while nothing but utter sex-appeal drips from my rill curvy-bod. ;-x”) turned 18 this week and was immediately offered multiple opportunities to do porn. We give a stop-giving-attention-to-her-because-that’s-gross DART to the porn industry. Y’all can do better.
Though we don’t want to dwell on idle gossip, (Ginger) 
Spice Girl Geri Halliwell and comedian Russell Brand could be dating. We give a bangers-and-mash-and-other-British-raunchy-puns LAUREL to the potential Hallibrand or Russ-
ri. We think they would be a really fun couple! Or maybe we just miss seeing Ginger Spice out and about.
Did you hear Ann Romney speak on Tuesday night dur-
ing the Republican National Convention? Did you know that the humble picture she was trying to paint didn’t add up to an interview she gave in 1994? We give a sorry-but-you-will-always-be-fact-checked DART to Mrs. Mittens. You tried, 
but you’re not going to pull the robot wool over our eyes.
Texas has been trying to enact an election law that would 
require voters to have a photo ID. Some voters in Texas would have to drive potentially 250 miles round-trip just to acquire that ID, but not everyone can manage that. We give a we’re-glad-Washington, D.C.-is-messing-with-Texas LAUREL  to 
the federal court who blocked the law .
Not only is Tropical Storm/Hurricane/Tropical Storm 
Isaac ﬂ  ooding states, it’s also raising gas prices. Since so much of our oil goes through pipelines or reﬁ  neries in the Gulf of Mexico, this means we’ll see gas prices go up even more than they already have. We give a come-on-stop-beating-every-one-up DART to that stupid Isaac storm.
Studies done in Sweden show that men and women who 
eat a little more than 2 ounces of chocolate per week will have a reduced risk of having a stroke. Men and women who ate chocolate, when compared to the participants who ate little to no chocolate, showed about a 19 percent lower risk of stroke. We give a thanks-but-also-couldn’t-eating-a-lot-of-chocolate-cause-other-diseases LAUREL  to Swedish scientists .

On Aug. 11, Republican 
presidential candidate Mitt Romney finally told 
the political world that he had chosen U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, from Wisconsin, as his running mate for the election.
And thus, the dirty, muddy, 
slanderous political campaigning goes on.
The Obama campaign has con-
tinued to tweet things like, “Paul Ryan is an architect of the top-down GOP budget that cuts edu-cation, energy, & innovation even as it gives tax cuts to the wealthy.”
Tweets also included “Romney-
Ryan: The Go Back Team” and “The no. 1 thing you need to know about Paul Ryan: He’s extremely conservative—at the expense of the middle class.”
Mudslinging is a political tactic 
that has been used for hundreds of years. 
During the 1820s, John Quincy 
Adams called Andrew Jackson’s mother a prostitute and his wife an adulteress.
While Romney and President 
Barack Obama aren’t going as far as saying that each other’s moth-ers were loose with gentlemen, they still sound like kindergarten bullies.
There isn’t completely con-
clusive evidence that a negative campaign will gain or lose voters. In 1994, the American Political Sci-ence Review published a study that suggested that attack adver-tisements drive potential voters away. In 1996, the UCLA Center for Research in Society and Politics found the opposite.
But there is a reason campaigns 
involve mudslinging: If someone is mean, instinct says be mean right back.
However, this is one of the most 
politically divisive times in U.S. history since the antebellum era. The 112th Congress may be the least productive legislature since 1947, according to USA Today.
While people complain about 
Obama not doing anything, the real problem is that Congress isn’t doing anything.
It is the president’s responsibil-
ity, however, to convince Congress to pass bills and to unite the legis-lative branch for the greater good of the country. 
Instead of tweeting about the 
other guy’s problems, his cam-paign should try tweeting solu-tions.
While mudslinging may be 
effective in getting a candidate elected, it divides the two political parties.
Right now we don’t need a can-
didate who is good at being mean, and we d o n ’ t n e e d a can-
d i d a t e 
who won a dirty election. 
We need a candidate with the 
ability to lead. We need a candi-date who can unite the two par-ties so that they can finally agree on something and stop trying to repeal health care reform for the 31st time.
Negative campaigning may be 
a good political strategy. It may work wonders for getting a can-didate into office. But getting a candidate into office means noth-ing if he or she isn’t going to get anything done.
It’s easy to say that once the 
election blows over, all that nega-tivity will be forgotten. 
But it won’t. The two parties complain about 
each other more often than John Boehner gets a spray tan.
Maybe, under a good leader, 
the children in Congress will final-ly put aside their differences and work together — but that doesn’t seem likely in a race filled with candidates who are calling the oth-er party’s candidates big meanies.

UWireAn article released by 
the Associated Press last week reported 
that drivers have been paying record prices for gasoline. The national average for Aug. 20 was $3.72 per gallon, up from $3.58 a gallon in 2011. Judg-ing by these numbers, we can observe that the cost of gas has risen dramatically, leav-ing many students posing the question, “When, if ever, will prices begin to go down and stay down?”
Before we can discuss how 
we lower costs, let’s look at what determines them.
A myriad of factors come 
into play influencing day-to-day fluctuations in gas prices, such as speculation, daily refinery output, geopolitical events, etc.
However, the greatest fac-
tor that affects cost is supply and demand. If demand is greater than the amount of fuel being supplied, then naturally, prices will increase. If supply is greater than demand, prices will decrease. At this time, de-mand is greater than the sup-ply.The 
U.S. is o n l y one of m a n y 
industrialized nations, much like China and India, that con-sumes large amounts of gaso-line every day. We are compet-ing in a globalized economy. In order to drive costs down, we need to increase the sup-ply.
While the U.S. is a major 
exporter of crude and refined oil, we are trying to help feed the voracious appetite of growing nations all over the globe. That being understood, we need to increase domestic drilling in areas like the Arc-tic National Wildlife Refuge and the untouched oil sands in Utah and Alaska; develop new and more efficient ways of harvesting existing oil and gas reserves; and continue the ongoing search for more un-tapped sources at home and abroad.

nist for the Central Florida Fu-ture at the University of Central Florida.

Full buses were common on campus this week. A record-break-
ing 64,835 passengers rode buses Wednesday.
JULIA GLUM
Alligator Staff Writer
About 63,000 people rode Re-
gional Transit System buses Aug. 
22, shattering numbers from 2011 to set a ridership record.
This week, they broke the re-
cord again.
RTS Marketing and Communi-
cations Supervisor Chip Skinner said 64,835 passengers rode the Gainesville buses on Wednesday, which surpassed last week’s re-cord by 1,441 people.
The record-setting data will get 
reported to state and federal agen-cies that determine RTS funding.
Per capita, RTS is the No. 1 tran-
sit agency in the state. 
Last year, they made more than 
10 million passenger trips, Skinner said.
Skinner said Wednesdays are 
the heaviest ridership days because that’s the day most UF and Santa Fe classes are held.
Ruth Steiner, associate profes-
sor in the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, said the new record is “a testament to a well-de-signed transit system.”
Steiner also praised the bus 
schedule. 
She said many passengers don’t 
even have to plan their trips because buses come so often.
“Historically, the second 
Wednesday of each Fall semester is our highest ridership of any day,” Skinner said. “We really are attributing this to the down econ-omy — more people are trying to save money by using transit.”
UF and Santa Fe College stu-
dents comprise about 75 percent of the overall ridership, Skinner said, and RTS has a fleet of 105 buses and 42 weekday routes. 
He said that as students learn 
their schedules, the crowds will even out.
People riding buses means less 
congestion around campus and better air quality, Steiner said.
It’s good from a green perspec-
tive,” Steiner said. “The more stu-dents we get on the buses, the nicer it is for everyone in the community.
“I can tell you there’s less traffic 
coming to campus now than there was 15 to 20 years ago, because more students are on the buses,” Steiner said.

In the weeks after Panhellenic 
sorority recruitment, an alterna-
tive group is hoping to attract women who are looking for a different sisterhood experience.
Delta Nu Zeta, a local sorority , 
will begin its first formal recruit-ment for the UF Beta chapter in a couple of weeks.
“Not every girl will like Pan-
hellenic, but some still want a sisterhood or a home away from home,” said DNZ president Mina Radman, a 20-year-old journalism junior.
DNZ is not affiliated with 
UF’s Panhellenic Council, Na-tional Pan-Hellenic Council or the Multicultural Greek Coun-cil. Radman said she hopes this independence helps her chapter gain a distinct identity.
“This Fall class will help shape what it’s going to be like,” she said. “We only exist here and [at] FSU.”
The FSU chapter was found-
ed in 2003 and now has 27 active members.
Rush for the UF chapter will 
be Sept. 10 to Sept. 14 at 7 p.m. The location hasn’t been selected, but potential members can stay up to date by visiting deltanuze-tauf.weebly.com.
Though Radman said she 
hopes to recruit a group of close-knit women, she said DNZ won’t have some of the perks Panhel-lenic sororities have, like meal plans or houses. However, their dues will be much less than tra-ditional sororities.
UF Panhellenic Council’s es-
timated average dues are $1,883 each semester, which covers meal plans, socials, T-shirts and other expenses. DNZ requires $275 for the first semester and $200 each following semester.
“This is a much more low-key 
sorority experience,” she said.
But the sorority life might 
not appeal to everyone. Jamie Wilson, a 20-year-old journalism senior, said she didn’t rush Pan-hellenic sororities because she thought they were cliquey . She won’t  rush DNZ either.
“I don’t see the difference 
between it and other sororities,” Wilson said. “It’s like a sorority for GDIs.”

Delta Nu Zeta president� POSSIBLE CHEATING         
OCCURRED IN ABOUT HALF OF THE TAKE-HOME EXAMS.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Dozens 
of Harvard University students are 
being investigated for cheating after school officials discovered they may have shared answers or plagiarized on a final exam.
Harvard officials declined to re-
lease the name of the class, the stu-dents’ names or the exact number being investigated, citing privacy laws.
The undergraduate class had a 
minimum of 250 students and pos-sible cheating was discovered in roughly half the take-home exams, university officials said Thursday.“These allegations, if proven, rep-
resent totally unacceptable behavior that betrays the trust upon which intellectual inquiry at Harvard de-pends,” President Drew Faust said.
Each student whose work is in 
question has been called to appear before a subcommittee of the Har -
vard College Administrative Board, which reviews issues of academic integrity , said Jay M. Harris, dean of undergraduate Education. He em-phasized that none of the allegations has been proven and said there’s no evidence of widespread cheating at Harvard.
“The facts that are before us are 
that we have a problem in this one course,” Harris said. “Looking at the students we have and the work that they do, I would be loathe to say this is something that represents Har -
vard students generally.”Harvard probing dozens

� HE’S PLAYED QUARTERBACK, 
RUNNING BACK, TIGHT END, FULL BACK AND WIDEOUT AT UF.

For an offense that didn’t do 
much of anything last season, Trey 
Burton was constantly trying out dif-ferent roles.
The junior lined up at five differ -
ent positions, including quarterback, running back and wide receiver. He also played special teams.
“The kid’s got great athletic 
skills,” offensive coordinator Brent Pease said. “He can catch. He’s tough. He can get tough yards. He can block. He can be a receiver in motion, and he’s smart. He knows all the positions.”
Burton made headlines his fresh-
man season with a national-best six-touchdown performance against Kentucky in his first-ever home Southeastern Conference game.
The former Venice High School 
dual-threat quarterback saw his touchdowns, rushing yards, yards per rush and receiving yards dip in his sophomore campaign. 
Burton went from 75 to 37 carries. 
His touchdowns decreased by eight. 
In his defense, every team offen-
sive category except passing yards fell in coach Will Muschamp’s first season. 
Although Burton said he doesn’t 
plan on ever moving on from the 7-6 season, the player with no set posi-tion has a job to do for UF in 2012. 
UF’s defense found out first hand 
how Burton can affect the opponent.“It’s definitely going to be real 
confusing for them when other de-fenses line up against him because they might have Trey Burton line up at tight end, and then once they say ‘hut,’ he’s going to be at receiver split out wide, or he might be at run-ning back,” starting Buck linebacker Lerentee McCray said.
He arrived at Florida expecting 
to play quarterback for his entire college career. Instead, Burton and former coach Urban Meyer talked about possible position changes due to low roster numbers.
“I didn’t want to sit,” Burton said. 
“That was the main reason why Ur -
ban and I had that talk. I’m really happy with what I’m doing so far and I love it. I just have to continue to do it.”
In 2012, Burton dealt with his 
third offensive coordinator in as many training camps. 
Throughout the changes, one skill 
has stayed with the versatile athlete — his intelligence. 
Burton has passed his knowledge 
onto his teammates.
“He just takes to the game very 
well, so you’re able to put him in a lot of different spots and you get where you term ‘rep’ guys,’” Mus-champ said. 
“Well, rep guys, they’ve got to rep 
it over and over. Trey’s not (that). He’s a guy you can verbalize and say, ‘Remember, here, this is what we want.’
“He understands that part of it, 
which helps in special teams, helps on offense, (and) helps in a lot of ar -
eas.”

Like the throngs of people waiting for 
the release of Lil Wayne’s Dedication 4 mixtape, we here at the alligatorSports 
Brand Picks Column started bugging out when the calendar turned to Aug. 30 yes-terday! College football season has arrived! Wait, Weezy didn’t drop the tape on time? I see “Sorry 4 the Wait 2” on the horizon!
This week, we let two writers debate the 
old-fashioned, traditional Michigan-Alabama  showdown.
‘Bama (-13.5) will bury Michigan “6 Foot, 
7 Foot” under because...
It’s Ala-BAMA!Nick Saban is all jacked up on Little Deb-
bie Oatmeal Creme Pies, and Eddie Lacy is the next great Crimson Tide running back. Alabama returns four starting offensive line-man with 95 combined career starts, includ-ing All-American center Barrett Jones. If any offensive lineman is a household name, it’s this guy.
The Wolverines do not stand a chance 
against this Southeastern Conference behe-moth. Hell, even Wolverine can’t take down big, bad ‘Bama.
Let’s talk about Denard Robinson. Can that 
guy even throw a daggum football? I’ve seen mistakes more accurate than that guy.
—JOE MORGAN
Michigan (+13.5) will be steady mobbin’ 
Alabama because...
Southeastern Conference or not, the boys 
at Alabama are human. 
Sure, Saban and the national champs have 
all the talent in the world and are primed for another stellar season in 2012. But that doesn’t mean a defense returning only four starters will be ready to contend with Robin-son, maybe the top dual-threat quarterback in all of college football. 
In 2011, he became just the third player in 
FBS history to rush for 1,000 yards and pass for 2,000 in back-to-back seasons, and there’s no reason he won’t be even better in 2012. 
Besides, the north is just better. Simple as 
that.

The Gators will feast today.
Paul Spangler is more focused on not 
starving come November.
The Western Carolina Invitational at 
6:25 p.m. will be Spangler’s first test at the helm of Florida cross country. But with the men returning their top five runners and the women missing just Genevieve LaCaze, Spangler said he doesn’t expect much competition in Cullowhee, N.C.
Instead, he is more concerned with 
taking over a program that hasn’t won a men’s Southeastern Conference title since he was in grade school and also taking over a women’s team that lost one of its all-time best runners in LaCaze.
“The training is a little different than 
what they’ve done in the past,” Spangler said. “The way I train them is a bit dif-ferent than some other coaches do. The great thing about distance running is there [are] different ways you can train them.”
Spangler, who spent the last 10 years 
as the Virginia Military Institute’s coach, replaced Todd Morgan after he left for Virginia in January 2012. The former Alabama cross country runner jumped right in on the new job and helped lead Florida’s track team in the spring with 
Spangler bringing fresh outlook to UFhis new workout plan.
  “With our type of training, I would say it’s more 
speed-based,” Spangler said.
  Not only are the runners experiencing more speed 
workouts but they also spend more time in the weight 
room. He said this will help reduce injury and fatigue as the season progresses. 
  Perhaps more meaningful than the training ses-
sions and practices, the team has adopted Spangler’s new philosophy: run with purpose. 
  “Every mile we run has a meaning to it,” Jimmy 
Clark said. “In the past we had some runs where we’re just getting out there and running and I feel this year, every run we do has a meaning to it.”
  Clark said it was this change of attitude that will 
help bring the Gators more success than last year, when the men ﬁ  nished second in the SEC and the women took third. 
  In 2011, both UF teams opened the year with wins 
at the WCU Invitational, but each managed to ﬁ  nish ﬁ  rst only once more later in the season. Clark and the rest of the Gators hope to make more of an impact in the later and larger meets under Spangler’s direction.
  “Everyone on our team hopped on board and real-
ly rallied around (Spangler),” Clark said. “He pushes us and gets us to do the best we can.” nology” Morgan, who hunt-and-pecks his way through his stories and transcriptions with literally two ﬁ  ngers. Like a hunter using a slingshot, Joe isn’t interested in keeping up with the times. We once suggested he could dictate his stories to us over the phone, but he was wor-ried that, once his beeper went off, he wouldn’t be able to ﬁ  nd a phone bank before deadline.
  New to the alligatorSports staff and football beat is 
Adam “Casual Tuesdays” Pincus, who showed up for his fourth day of work wearing a knockoff Miami Heat cham-pionship tank top and a camo velcro Coors Light hat. Way to make a strong ﬁ  rst impression. In related news, Pincus is a member of a fraternity.
Then there is The Miami Herald’s Matt “Too good for 
Nease girls’ tennis” Watts, who is writing for The Mi-ami Herald in exchange for food stamps and creeping on 17-year-olds instead of actually furthering his career.
From InsideTheGators.com, Bryan “Trafﬁ  c medians 
are stupid” Holt, who decided that an unexpected game of “Chicken” was the best gift he could give to a friend on his 21st birthday. Holt, buckle up, keep those hands at 10 and 2 and don’t get too crazy. People Only Live Once! Also, the designated hitter is stupid.
From The Associated Press, defending champion Mark 
“I wish I had a striped, green Gators POLO” Long, who showed his admiration for coach Will Muschamp’s ward-robe by snapping an incognito photo of coach Boom, and tweeting it out to his followers. Will’s a good dude, Mark. I’m sure he could hook you up with some swag.
 Then there’s Josh “[INSULT GOES HERE]” Jurnovoy, 
who is so boring and bland we couldn’t think of anything to write in this space. Could be a long season for the picks column crew. Well, better luck next time. 
  Another new addition to the picks column this season 
is Palm Beach Post beat writer Jason “Oh my God! It’s everywhere!” Lieser, who spent his Thursday cleaning up his family’s vomit. Jason claims he may have caught the illness, but we’re thinking he’s just trying to get a week-end off. It’s the ﬁ  rst game of the season, man, get it to-gether!

Florida’s season opener was not the best 
night for sophomore goalkeeper Taylor 
Burke.
Against an unranked Miami squad on 
Aug. 17, Burke allowed four goals — two on corner kicks. Not only did the Gators’ back-line look disoriented against the Hurricanes’ attack, but Burke did as well.
Burke could have easily been demoralized 
by such a rough start to the season. Instead, she used it to get better.
Learning from her errors against Miami, 
the 6-foot-1 Burke was a defensive stalwart in net for Florida last weekend. Against North Carolina and Duke, she finished with 10 saves and allowed only two goals.
Coach Becky Burleigh said Burke did 
a better job being courageous on dives for crosses and balls in the box.
“Against Miami, their last goal was a ball 
she came for and didn’t get,” Burleigh said. “[Last] weekend, it was a little different. The ones she came for she touched or she caught. And that gives our backline a lot of confi-dence, knowing that she’s going to come out and deal with those balls rather than them being bouncing around in the box.”
While opposing teams on average have 
attacked UF more frequently than last sea-son, Burke has risen to the occasion.
In 2011, Burke had 34 saves in 20 match-
es. She already has 15 in three matches this season, and her save percentage is 71, eight points higher than last year.
Sophomore outside back Lauren Silver 
said Burke has not only improved as a lead-er, but as a communicator.
“At least compared to last year, she com-
municates a lot, which really helps us, be-cause we have to stay organized,” Silver said.“I’m on the post during the bulk of corner 
kicks, so if they’re kicking it and it goes out, she’ll tell me to push up and stay in the post, and kind of direct me what to do. I just listen to her and feed off her information.”
Burke has a grasp on the starting goal-
keeper spot, but Burleigh isn’t guaranteeing anything in the future.
Throughout the season, Burke will com-
pete with 5-foot-9 freshman Valerie Tysinger for starts. A leg injury Tysinger suffered dur-ing a preseason scrimmage has hindered her progress so far.
“I wouldn’t say [Burke’s starting job] is 
on lock,” Burleigh said. “It’s going to be a battle all year long between those two. Taylor has a little bit of a heads up on it because of the fact she got to start these first games.”
Burke is used to cam-
paigning for starter’s 
minutes. She competed with senior Brooke Chancey for the job in 2011 and earned 18 of the 25 starts. 
Once again, Burke will embrace the chal-
lenge.
“Val’s been working hard in practice ev-
ery single day,” Burke said. “She pushes me and I push her back and forth to get better. She’s definitely a great training partner.”
When No. 22 Florida (1-1-1) faces No. 1 
Florida State (2-0-0) in Tallahassee tonight at 7, Burke will try to withstand one of the most electric attacks in the nation. FSU forwards Tiffany McCarty and Jessica Price combined for 22 goals and 15 assists a year ago.
Burke hopes to build on her solid week-
end with another one.
“[Last weekend] was a good step for-
ward,” Burke said. “I just need to keep work-ing on things in practice and just keep mov-ing forward.”Burke excelling in net for Florida

◗ UF FACES TEXAS TODAY AT 4:30 
IN UNIVERSITY PARK, PA.

Because the average height for 
Florida A&M, Florida Gulf Coast and 
FIU is 5 feet 11 inches, it’s no surprise that 6-foot-2 Chloe Mann and 6-foot Živa Recek combined for 71 kills at the Campus USA Credit Union Invite last weekend. 
However, kills will be harder to 
come by today as No. 18 Florida (3-0) takes on No. 2 Texas (4-0) at the Nike Big Four Classic in University Park, Pa., at 4:30. The Longhorns’ pin hitters and middle blockers have an average height of almost 6 feet 3 inches. 
“This Texas team is going to be one 
of those teams in the mix to win it all because of their talent,” coach Mary Wise said. “This may be the best block-ing team we face all year. They’re big and physical.”
Last season the Longhorns ranked 
12th in blocks per set with 2.77.
This season is no different for Texas. 
So far, they’ve already racked up 21 solo blocks and 56 block assists.
Because of the Longhorns’ height 
and blocking ability, the Gators will be relying heavily on their serving.
“Because Texas can’t block the 
serve, it’s our best chance at getting the ball past the net,” Wise said. “Serving, in truth, is going to be a really big part of our team’s ability to score points. We’re very happy with the serving thus far out of Simone (Antwi) and Berkley (Whaley). Now the challenge is to do that on the road in a new gym.”
Last weekend Florida accumulated 
25 service aces, 36 percent of which came from Antwi, a redshirt freshman. She also led the Gators in aces during every match last weekend.“She’s really taken ownership of 
it,” said Wise after Saturday’s game. “She’s going to make some errors, but when she gets her hand on it, that ball comes from a high contact point and drops. It’s like she’s got a wicked cur -
veball or a slider that goes away from the passers. It could be pretty exciting long term.”
Leading the Gators by four aces is 
quite an accomplishment for the mid-dle blocker, considering that at this time last year she wasn’t even allowed to serve in practice. Wise thought serv-ing wasn’t a worthwhile use of Antwi’s practice time. 
“Me and Dave (Boos) worked on 
serving during preseason, so we broke it down and did it step-by-step until it came together,” Antwi said. “This weekend, serving (is) important to get them out of their system so they can’t really hit some of those crazy angles 
that they do.”
A l t h o u g h 
Wise believes that serving will be Flori-
da’s best opportunity to score points this weekend, there will need to be a significant improvement from last weekend, when they accounted for 26 service errors, 15 of which came against FGCU.
“We’re going to have as difficult a 
time scoring points and finding a way to get the ball to the floor than just about anybody we play all season,” Wise said.  “It’s just a matter of how do we generate enough points against two teams that are going to be in the mix for the national championship come December.
“But what a great opportunity for 
us early on, to see where we stand and know that these types of matches are only going to help us down the road.”

 During halftime on Saturday, Florida 
coach Will Muschamp will have to make a 
choice: Jacoby Brissett or Jeff Driskel.
  Nearly six months have passed since the 
Gators held their ﬁ  rst spring practice on March 14, but heading into the season open-er against Bowling Green, Florida still does not have a starting quarterback.
  “They both deserve the right to play,” 
Muschamp said. “They’ve earned that and they both deserve the right to start. They both have had really good camps.”
  As Muschamp and offensive coordinator 
Brent Pease have constructed the rotation, each quarterback will play a quarter in the ﬁ  rst half against Bowling Green.  Brissett and Driskel will each have 15 
minutes to try to earn the starting job against Texas A&M.
  “You just have to go with who’s mov-
ing the team,” Pease said. “The good thing about this is that they’re going to be in real game-time situations.”
  After a fall camp veiled in ambiguity, 
Muschamp sat down with his quarterbacks to share his plan for the season opener.
  As Muschamp explained the rotation, 
Brissett did not bother to hone in on the spe-ciﬁ  cs. 
  “I wasn’t really paying attention to it,” 
Brissett said. “I knew I was going to play, that’s it. That’s all that really mattered. I was there, but when I heard that both of us were going to play, then all right, then that’s all that matters. As long as we both play.”  Driskel came into the meeting expecting 
a different development.
  “I thought they were going to name a 
starter, but I knew it was going to be dif-ﬁ  cult for them,” Driskel said. “I wouldn’t want to be the guy to have to pick between us.”
  As of Thursday night, Muschamp had yet 
to announce which quarterback would take the Gators’ ﬁ  rst snap of the season. Pease joked UF should leave it up to chance.
  “I don’t know,” Pease said. “Maybe a ﬂ  ip 
of the coin, see who gets it.”

  When Brissett committed to UF in 2011, 
he was joining a class already headlined by Driskel, the nation’s No. 1 quarterback re-cruit. 
Brissett — ranked third overall — signed 
late with Florida instead of Miami, his moth-er’s preference.
  Once Brissett signed his letter of intent, 
he issued a challenge to Driskel.
  “[Driskel] will have to prove to me every 
day, every year that he’s going to be better than me for him to win that starting spot,” Brissett said on Feb. 4, 2011.
  Driskel, who got a head start on the 
competition by enrolling in Januray 2011, originally bested Brissett coming out of pre-season camp last year. The Oviedo native was No. 2 on the depth chart heading into the 2011 campaign.
  However, as the season progressed, Bris-
sett eventually passed Driskel on the depth chart. Driskel played in ﬁ  ve of Florida’s ﬁ  rst seven games; he made his ﬁ  nal appearance against Auburn on Oct. 15, 2011. Meanwhile, Brissett appeared in the Gators’ ﬁ  nal seven regular-season games, including two starts.
  Both quarterbacks have their faults.  Pease said Driskel needs to work on “pro-
tecting himself on the run and still making quick decisions.”
  “I’ve never really been one to slide or 
want to get out of bounds, but I’m going to have to be careful this year and not take too many shots if I don’t have to.”
  Brissett’s problem revolves around his 
pocket awareness, Pease said. The West Palm Beach native gets “comfortable in the pocket.”
  “Make a quick decision and go vertical,” 
Pease said. “Vertical runs, and protect your-self.”
  Despite their shortcomings, both quarter-
backs have progressed signiﬁ  cantly. Pease has been impressed by their improvement since spring practice.
  “They have both done a really good job 
with how they’ve handled the situation and how they progressed,” Pease said. “It would be difﬁ  cult to say, to name a starter right now.”
  ▪ ▪ ▪
  Pease is committed to employing the 
two-quarterback strategy against Bowling Green, but nothing is set in stone beyond this weekend.
  Muschamp’s plans for the signal-callers 
moving forward are equally uncertain. Could the rotation return in Week 2?
  “I don’t know — tough to answer,” Pease 
said. “I don’t think so. That’s my gut feeling. I don’t know if it’s sustainable from there. It depends how they play, I guess, and what they create. … I don’t know. Ask me that in a week. I don’t know that answer.”
  Driskel added: “Obviously, that’s not the 
ideal situation, but if that’s what it comes down to, we’re going to have to make it work.”
  Pease and Driskel are not inclined to be-
lieve lightning can strike thrice at Florida.
  Most recently, the Gators experienced 
success with the duo of Chris Leak and Tim Tebow in 2006. With Leak manning the aer-ial attack and Tebow establishing the power run game, Florida cruised to a 13-1 record and won its second national title in school history.
  The Gators succeeded with the Leak-
Tebow model as a result of moderation.
  Tebow would run the occasional play-ac-
tion pass or throw a jump ball into the back of the end zone every once in a while, but Leak was the go-to guy.
  Leak threw 91.5 percent of Florida’s pass-
es in 2006.
  Rewind all the way back to 1997 to 
ﬁ  nd another two-quarterback scenario in Gainesville, one similar to the Brissett-Driskel race.
  Former Gators coach Steve Spurrier fa-
mously alternated quarterbacks Noah Brin-dise and Doug Johnson in No. 10 Florida’s upset victory against top-ranked Florida State in 1997. The Gators’ win against the Seminoles marked the ﬁ  rst time UF ever de-feated a No. 1 team at Florida Field.
  Spurrier decided to start Brindise while 
driving his son, Scottie, to school.
  “I said, ‘Who should I start?’” Spurrier 
said. “And he said, ‘When Noah has started, you’ve never lost a game, have you?’ I said, ‘Hey, that’s right. I’ll put him out there for the ﬁ  rst play.’ So, we put Noah out the ﬁ  rst play, and they were both good.”
  The Brindise-Johnson duo completed 18 
of 34 passes for 318 yards, including a 63-yard connection between Johnson and wide receiver Jacquez Green on Florida’s game-winning touchdown drive.
  “When you rotate quarterbacks, it can 
work one or two games or so,” Spurrier said. “But then after that, it sort of quits work-ing. But as a change of pace, there’s nothing wrong with playing two quarterbacks.”
  Spurrier has not had the same success 
with multiple signal-callers at South Caroli-na. Two separate quarterback battles involv-ing Stephen Garcia have both spiraled out of control in the past four years. Last October, Garcia was dismissed from the team.
  Now that the Gamecocks have Connor 
Shaw as their deﬁ  nitive man under center heading into the 2012 campaign, Spurrier said, “It’s been a little more peaceful around here.”
▪ ▪ ▪  
  No matter who ultimately earns Mus-
champ’s allegiance, the lengthy decision process speaks volumes — there is no job se-curity for Gators quarterbacks this season.
  Whether Brissett or Driskel line up under 
center, each quarterback will always need to make an extra read over his shoulder.
  “The other guy’s got to be ready,” Pease 
said on Aug. 8. “He’s going to be the most popular guy in town anyway. You never know when your opportunity is. It could be one play in the season, it could come down to one play in a season.”
  Driskel and Brissett both got a taste of the 
ﬁ  re too early. 
Last season, John Brantley was sidelined 
twice — after suffering a leg injury against Alabama and sustaining a concussion against Florida State.
  That need to be ready at all times is why 
Brissett and Driskel keep working.
  “I don’t think I’ll be competing harder, 
because I think I am going as hard as I can and doing everything to help it,” Driskel said. “I’m just going to prepare the same and be ready if my name gets called.”
  Brissett added: “The battle will never 
end. Every day is a struggle and you got to go out and compete as hard as you can.”

Jeff Driskel said he didn’t expect Florida to head into 2012 without a deﬁ  nitive starter at 
quarterback, but he and Jacoby Brissett have been dead even every step of the way.

Jacoby Brissett was a late enrollee to UF, which had already signed Jeff Driskel, the No. 1 
quarterback recruit. By midseason, Brissett had overtaken Driskel on the depth chart.

A 7-6 season is not acceptable at Flor -
ida. 
Neither is a reputation as a ‘soft’ foot-
ball team, one coach Will Muschamp 
tagged the group with after a 21-7 loss to Florida State in the Swamp on Nov. 26. 
Those distinctions have left an indelible 
mark on the Gators who suffered through 2011. 
“You always remember it,” Trey Burton 
said. “Even when I’m 40, I’ll still remem-ber my sophomore year at the University of Florida. You’ve always got to keep it in the back of your mind, and strive not for it to happen again.”
“I don’t think it’ll ever get put out of 
our mind, until maybe about January, at the end of the season,” Frankie Hammond Jr. said. “To me, that’s a motivation for our whole team.”
Muschamp wants that sting to linger. 
He wants his players to use it to get stron-ger and faster, to spark a turnaround in his second year at the helm. 
Offensive tackle Chaz Green said the 
Gators took being called ‘soft’ personally. The pejorative label hung in the players’ minds throughout the offseason. 
Just the way Muschamp wanted it to. “You never put last season behind you,” 
Muschamp said. “You’ve got to learn from it and move forward and let it motivate you. That’s what we’ve done as a staff, and as a team.”
Step 1 of that transformation started 
just one day after the 2011 season ended, when new director of strength and condi-tioning Jeff Dillman came aboard. 
Under a new weightlifting program 
filled with Olympic-style workouts, play-ers added pounds of muscle in an effort to shake the ‘soft’ designation. 
“It’s been very obvious the confidence level of our players has gained a lot from the standpoint of we’re stronger, and we’re a more fit football team than we were a year ago,” Muschamp said. “We were a young team last year and a lot of these guys really bought in to what we were doing in the weight room, and we have gotten stronger. We’ve made tremendous strides.”
Step 2 was a more physical fall training 
camp. 
The Gators were forced to minimize 
full-contact practices and cut back on reps in fall 2011 because of a lack of depth. 
After an influx of freshman talent in the 
offseason, taking it easy was hardly a con-cern in 2012. 
Florida ran more than 130 plays in its fi-
nal fall scrimmage. Last season, the Gators were hesitant to run more than 80. 
“This year was a physical camp, it was 
hard,” linebacker Jon Bostic said. “We knew we were going to have to go through it, to prove we were going to be a physical team this year.”
“We’re going to practice hard,” Mus-
champ said. “When you have good depth on your football team, you’re able to do that. We’re going to go good-on-good ev-ery day. That’s how you get better. That’s how you improve.”
Step 3 is to translate it to the field. Flor -
ida’s first opportunity to do so comes Sat-urday at 3:30 p.m., when Bowling Green travels to The Swamp to kick off the new season. 
The Gators are eager to wash the taste 
of 2011 from their mouths. 
Their last game on Florida Field was 
the loss to Florida State that earned Mus-champ’s ire. A week earlier, Florida over -
come an early 15-point deficit to avoid embarrassment against FCS opponent Furman. 
“The last time we played in our sta-
dium, we didn’t coach or play very well,” Muschamp said. “[We’re] looking forward to getting back in front of our stands.”
Muschamp will also see the unveiling 
of new offensive coordinator Brent Pease’s fresh, motion-based attack. He’ll have a chance to see the ongoing quarterback bat-tle between Jeff Driskel and Jacoby Brissett spill over into real games.  
Defensive coordinator Dan Quinn said 
he’s looking for physicality, communica-tion, tackling and a defense hungry to set the tone after the way 2011 ended, despite their No. 8 ranking in total defense. 
The players are only looking for anoth-
er chance. 
“We’re just trying to get back to where 
we were,” Green said. “We know we can be playing Florida football. … We didn’t have the best showings offensively the last few times we were here, so we should think of this as a new year, where we re-deem ourselves.” 
“We want to get back on top, and we 
came here to win,” Hammond said. “That’s the bottom line. … That’s the standard here at the university, so we definitely have a chip on our shoulders.”

UF coach Will Muschamp called his team “soft” last season. The Gators have used that 
comment for inspiration as they try to bounce back from a 7-6 finish to 2011.
