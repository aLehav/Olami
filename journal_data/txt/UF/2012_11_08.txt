Speechless.
That’s how Alex Tipton said he felt 
when he found out UF’s packaging-en-gineering team placed ﬁ  rst in a national competition.
He said he spent two months helping 
his peers prepare a hypothetical packag-ing proposal for a ﬁ  ctional company. Five other students competed on UF’s team at the Pack Expo International 2012 confer-ence last week, where they won $4,000 in scholarship funds to be split among them.
“Winning deﬁ  nitely made it worth-
while,” the 22-year-old senior said.
Bruce Welt, coordinator of UF’s pack-
aging-engineering program, said packag-ing engineers plan the physical packaging for products, and the conference is one of the industry’s biggest events.
“It’s kind of like the Super Bowl of the 
packaging industry,” he said.Gaby Cruz, a 23-year-old senior, said 
the project allowed students to gain real-world experience.
“When they ﬁ  rst arrived, it was clear 
they were better pre-pared than others,” Welt said. “It looked like some other teams were kind of scrambling after they saw what our students had 
put up.”
Welt said UF’s pro-gram is technical as opposed to other schools’ science-based curricula.
“I think that contributed to the level of 
success we’re now seeing,” he said.
Colleen Delaney was another student 
on UF’s team. The 22-year-old senior said she thought UF proved itself at the com-petition.
“Once we got there and started to see 
other proposals, our conﬁ  dence grew,” she said. “We knew we pored over every last detail of this project.”

A steel skeleton towered 
about 50 feet over the ﬁ  eld of 
Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium on Wednesday.
Composed of about 4,000 
parts, the infrastructure of the Gator Growl stage spans 60 feet wide by 52 feet deep on the east side of the stadi-um near the student section.
“This is the second year 
we’ve used this stage,”  said Jeff Chenery, director of pro-duction for the Stephen C. O’Connell Center. “We’ve done it on every side of the stadium except the west side.”
He said the stage’s new 
position allowed last year’s audience to have a clearer view of the Gator Growl performances, which is often touted as the largest student-run pep rally in the nation. This year’s show is sched-uled for 7 p.m. Friday.
Boxes of speakers and 
rows of spotlights and gas generators ﬁ  lled the corri-dors behind the student sec-tion, waiting to be placed at strategic points around the stadium. It will take an elec-trical current of about 2,000 amperes to power the three-hour show, according to an email from associate produc-Construction begins

Despite months of intense on-
campus attention from voting or-
ganizations, fewer students voted on campus this election cycle.
There were 3,432 ballots cast 
at the Reitz Union voting precinct out of 5,757 registered voters in Tuesday’s election, according to data from the county Supervisor of Elections Ofﬁ  ce.
In 2008, 3,923 votes were cast 
out of 4,512 registered voters.
Although there were about 500 
fewer voters in Tuesday’s election, the voter turnout dropped signiﬁ  -cantly more. In 2008, 86.9 percent of registered voters cast ballots compared to Tuesday’s 59.6 per-cent.
Voting participation dropped 
in Alachua County as well. This election, 120,006 county residents voted. In 2008, 126,321 voters cast ballots.
Kelly MacLellan, a 21-year-old 
jounalism senior and internal vice president of the Gator Coalition for Civic Engagement, said stu-dent voting on campus may have dropped due to the increased push for students to vote by absentee ballots at their home counties.Heather Dean, UF student rep-
resentative for Power Vote, said despite the county’s numbers dropping, student voting is on the rise nationwide.
“There is deﬁ  nitely increasing 
student and youth inﬂ  uence as time goes on,” said Dean, a 21-year-old political science senior. “Students are becoming more and more en-gaged each election season, and it’s really showing.”

UF students have a reason to 
say they go to the best school in 
Florida.
UF’s world rank is No. 122 out 
of the top 400 universities, accord-ing to Times Higher Education.
The Florida Institute of Tech-
nology and the University of South Florida, the only other ranked institutions in Florida, are more than 100 spots away.
UF is ranked higher on the list 
than prestigious schools such as Dartmouth College, No. 124, and Georgetown University, No. 174.
UF, which tied with University 
of California, Santa Cruz, has an overall score of 54.5 percent. 
The 2012-2013 world rankings 
use 13 categories to determine a university’s score.
Megan Nelson, a UF alumna, 
said it was easy for her to get a job after she graduated.
“I landed my first job two days 
after graduation as a talent coordi-nator for an international fashion company. It was so surreal,” she said. “I feel like I can go anywhere with my degree. ” 
The rankings by Thomson 
Reuters is the only global univer -
sity performance system to judge world-class universities across all of their core missions, according to Times Higher Education.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando 
said the university strives to be a great institution and to provide the best education value possible.
“UF places well in many other 
rankings,” Orlando said. “The reasons include top-notch faculty, reasonable tuition rates, a strong research enterprise and good job placement for our graduates. We compete well against our peer in-stitutions and others.”
On a scale of 100, UF received 
a 52 in teaching, a 31.2 in interna-tional outlook, a 62.9 in research and a 56 in citations.
Overall, the U.S. accounts for 
76 of the top 200 schools, and sev-en of the top 10 universities are U.S. schools.
According to a CNN article 
that analyzed the world rankings, American universities are becom-ing much less “American” and more global in their makeups.
International students account 
for 9 percent of UF’s population, more than any university in Flori-da, according to the UF website. 
However, there is always room 
to improve, Orlando said.
“It’s important for students to 
know that the university will con-tinue working to give them the best return on their tuition invest-ment,” Orlando said.
Fifth-year civil engineering  
student Andrew Cone, 21, said his professors teach students main methods and equations they cre-ated and had published world-wide.
He said his degree has such 
an impact that there are Gators around the world willing to help out fellow UF alumni.
“I feel like anywhere I go, all 
I have to do is show my Gator 1 Card, and they’ll let me in,” Cone said.UF ranks No. 122 in top 400 universities
The rankings were global
“It’s important for stu-
dents to know that the uni-
versity will continue working 
to give them the best return 
on their tuition investment.”

Construction workers build the stage for Gator Growl, which 
is on Friday night. They’ve been working since Sunday. 
The stage was packed in four semi trucks
er of show Megan Harmon.
At the Gate 9 security checkpoint, security 
supervisor Taylor Hennings ate lunch while 
bundled in a beanie, blankets and boots. About half of the stadium’s east and north sides have been unavailable to students since the construc-tion began, she said.
Hennings, a 22-year-old anthropology senior, 
said about 350 O’Connell Center employees and 40 professionals worked in shifts around the clock since 6 a.m. Sunday. Hennings worked about 40 hours at the stadium this week.
“It was colder at 2 a.m. when we got out 
here,” she said.
It took her and three other employees armed 
with forklifts three hours to unload the stage parts into the stadium. 
The stage was delivered from Mountain Pro-
ductions, a Pennsylvania-based staging compa-ny and is paid for on a year-to-year basis, Har-mon said.
“It’s four semis worth of gear,” Chenery 
said.
Although the week of Gator Growl prepa-
ration was hectic, Chenery said it was nothing compared to the breakdown after the show ends Friday night. Workers will have about six hours to get the ﬁ  eld back in football shape for Satur-day’s game.
“The Super Bowl, Grammys, Emmys, inau-
guration ceremony,” he listed. “They brag about what we do here. The load-out is matched no-where.”

When Stephanie Cineas 
graduated from Maynard Ev-
ans High School in 2008, she didn’t plan to return. That was before she heard about City Year, a national organization that places young adults in high-need urban schools for one year.
Now, Cineas, a 22-year-old 
UF sociology alumna, teaches ninth grade algebra at her alma mater. 
Of the 2,500 corps members 
this year, 24 are UF graduates. UF ranks No. 6 among the top 10 feeder schools for City Year’s corps, following No. 1 Univer-sity of California Riverside and No. 8 Florida International Uni-versity , the only other Florida school on the list.
City Year’s vice president 
of communications, Shaun Adamec, said about 75 percent of corps members are college graduates.“Selected candidates pos-
sess qualities that lend to suc-cess in service in high-need and high-poverty schools, where students are usually dealing with far more than just strug-gling with grades,” he said.
Florida has City Year ofﬁ  ces 
in Miami, Orlando and Jack-sonville.
“I don’t think people under-
stand that high need,” said Josh Funderburke, executive direc-tor of UF’s Center for Leader-ship and Service. “If it were easy and something that people wanted to do, there wouldn’t be a need for this program.”
Daniel Sibol, a 20-year-old 
political science and statistics junior, is one of the ﬁ  rst two UF City Year ambassadors. He schedules information sessions for students and attends events geared toward life after gradua-tion in an effort to create aware-ness for the program.
Sibol believes UF students 
show strongly in the rankings because getting involved is stressed so intensely.
“Ever since Preview, every-
one has been yelling at me to get involved,” he said.UF a top contributor

Thirteenth Street will get a little sweeter 
this spring.
SweetBerries, a Bradenton-based restau-
rant, plans to open a Gainesville location in 
early January. The restaurant will be in the building that housed Book Lover’s Cafe, 505 NW 13th St.
The family-owned business specializes 
in sandwiches, soups, salads and frozen custard. There is also a location in Sara-sota.
Restaurant co-owner Jane Osmond 
moved to Gainesville from Texas to help her sister manage the new restaurant. She said the restaurant’s menu will set it apart from other Gainesville eateries.
SweetBerries’ prices range from about $6 
to $8 for sandwiches and about $4 to $6 for custard.
“There’s very little frozen custard in 
Florida and none in Gainesville,” she said. “We’re quite conﬁ  dent that SweetBerries is going to do well.”
Osmond, a UF alumna, said she and her 
siblings are excited to return to the heart of the Gator Nation.
“We love the town and thought it’d be a 
good place for a restaurant,” she said.Michelle McGurn, a 21-year-old Santa Fe 
College third-year music education student, said she ate at SweetBerries for 15 years in Bradenton. 
She said she was ecstatic when she found 
out the restaurant was opening a location in Gainesville.
“I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I can’t believe 
they’re here,’” McGurn said. “I haven’t tru-ly felt like this is my home yet. Once Sweet-Berries does open, it’s like it’ll be complete for me.” Custard shop to open in former Book Lover’s Cafe location

With the end of election season, the outcome has be-
come a hot discussion topic at UF.
On Wednesday , one of the post-election discussions, 
titled “What just happened (and didn’t happen)?” fea-
tured seven panelists from UF’s department of political science.
The panel was a part of an informational series. At the panel, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences 
Dean Paul D’Anieri spoke about foreign policy , saying there were a couple attempts to make it an issue, but the issues were abandoned when they didn’t stick.
In addition, Kenneth Wald, a distinguished political 
science professor, addressed the role of candidates’ re-ligion. Professor Richard K. Scher took up the topic of Florida’s voting past and present and mentioned that the process of counting all the ballots can take weeks. Senior lecturer Lynn Leverty discussed women vot-
ing in the election and the gender gap.
Overall, Michael Martinez, political science chairman 
and professor, said the turnout was great.
“The more people that talk about the election, the 
more informed we become,” said psy-chology senior Taheerah Hawkins, 21.
Bob Graham Center for Public 
Service will also host a postelection panel at 6 p.m. Nov . 13 in the Buddy and Anne MacKay Auditorium au-
ditorium in Pugh Hall. University of South Florida professor Susan Mac-Manus and UF professor Dan Smith 
will speak.
The center’s communications director, Shelby Taylor, 
said the panelists will break down the election outcome. The panel will also stream live on the center’s website.Events to discuss post-election season

Linda Behar-Horenstein helps professors go back to school.
UF College of Dentistry earned a $2.5 million grant to refresh its 
professors on the newest teaching methods.
“We’re onto something really novel here,” said Behar-Horen-
stein, UF distinguished teaching scholar and professor.
The Health Resources and Services Administration gave the 
development grant to the dentistry school in July, but won’t imple-ment the plan until January.
“The primary target is faculty, the intermediate benefit are stu-
dents and the ultimate benefit are the patients,” said Frank Cata-lanotto, professor and chairman of community-based programs.
Faculty members will learn new teaching techniques and re-
ceive training.
“When I came in, I was a dentist, but I didn’t know anything 
about teaching,” Catalanotto said.
The training will also include how dentists can empathize with 
underprivileged patients as well as opportunities for students to work at federally funded health care centers before entering dental school.
“Through case-based learning, cultural competency workshops 
and the implementation of programs for students interested in public health and academic careers, the grant will not only have a positive impact on the dental curriculum but also prepare future UFCD graduates to meet the oral health needs of Florida’s growing population,” Olga Luaces, a 23-year-old second-year dental gradu-ate student, wrote in an email.
“I don’t want to come out and say it’s a problem, but if you 
haven’t walked in someone’s moccasins, you don’t know what they have been thorough,” Behar-Horenstein said.UF College of Denistry

nation in 2008, so he had to change a lot of his positions in the 
meantime.
Out of the possible choices for the Republican presidential 
candidate, Romney was the best — probably.
It felt like he was simply fulﬁ  lling a role once he received the 
nomination from the Grand Old Party. He was just some dude who now wore “Republican nominee” on his name-tag; in the proverbial playbill, it was his character’s name.
Perhaps that’s what you can say about each presidential can-
didate from the two major parties: They were simply selected to complete the voting cycle machine. Maybe it never matters whose face you put on a ballot, but only that party politics get noticed.
In this case, however, the party politics should have been as 
undesirable as the candidate.
The world makes a little less sense now. We have to trudge 
through some really scary times throughout the next four years.
Maybe we can ignore the fact that we have a president at all.Ignorance is bliss.Go about your days without a care in the world, folks, be-
cause everything is much worse if you start to care about stuff.
Pretend that basic human rights can be ignored. Imagine that 
no jobs will leave this country because manufacturing items in China is more appealing. Maybe women can graduate out of that pesky binder to something more form-ﬂ  attering, like a ﬂ  oppy disk or one of those shoe trees.
Sorry , America. It was halftime, and the replacement referees 
made the calls. We had only one shot, and we missed our chance to blow. This opportunity was one in a lifetime, yo (you better).
The celebrity endorsements couldn’t persuade you. The 
threat of homeless Muppets couldn’t persuade you.
We hate Mitt Romney because he hates his nonfellow hu-
mans. Real Americans will not beneﬁ  t from a Romney presi-dency . We will suffer, fail, cry and go into a depression. Not an economic depression. A real depression.
Couch sales will probably increase due to how sad we will be 
during the next four years.
Think back to, like, second grade. Your assigned seat is next 
to Rushald Trumbaugh. Rushald Trumbaugh is kind of a trou-blemaker — a blowhard-y windbag who only says things to get a rise out of people. He’s a real class clown.
One day, Rushald Trumbaugh yelled so many inaccurate 
facts that everyone got distracted from what he or she was try-ing to do, listened to him and believed what he said.
Because you always sit next to him, your teacher thought you 
were part of the problem, too. You both got in trouble. No, you didn’t do anything wrong, but you didn’t try to stop it, either.
Thanks to you and Rushald Trumbaugh, we have to sit 
through four years of an incredibly long timeout session while a boring man makes us wash dishes, even though they’re already clean.Everyone, regardless of age, race or position, is search-
ing for meaning in his or her life. 
In the hustle of daily living, it’s easy to forget 
what people are really reaching for. The university is 
helping students discover what creates the foundation for a good life.
There’s an extra three-credit course in freshman sched-
ules this year that many may not have planned to take. What 
is the Good Life? is an introductory humanities course that serves to unite freshmen and create a common experience for the class of 2016. 
Although the complaints about the class are a mile long 
due to the extensive workload and out-of-class requirements, it opens many students’ minds to a new world they may oth-erwise have not discovered. Knowledge is the greatest tool that graduates can possess, and with more opportunities to learn new things, students will have an edge on their com-petition.
The class makes students think in a nontraditional way. It 
asks philosophical questions that do not have a speciﬁ  c an-swer. For many freshmen math and science-oriented majors, this is not the way their brains work. Ancient readings are tied into modern excerpts through themes that equate to a good life.
With the assigned readings and lectures opened up to 
multiple interpretations, there’s room for discussion. Stu-dents in the class are asked to think analytically about the course material and to use their personal experience to relate to it.
Semester schedules are already full, and What is the Good 
Life? requires some extra effort. Because they had what it took to become Gators, students should already be accus-tomed to challenging themselves inside the classroom. For many , working this class into critical tracking may take some schedule readjustment.  
A mandatory course that draws students of all majors to-
gether is a fantastic idea. Ultimately, it serves as not only an educational experience but also a common bond. Once stu-dents are in upper-level courses within their majors, all of their classes will be speciﬁ  c, and they will not have classes with students outside their ﬁ  elds of study. What is the Good Life? opens the doors among UF’s 16 colleges.
Beyond the insight that the class 
provides, it fulﬁ  lls a humanities general education requirement. 
Although general education classes are usually chosen at the student’s discretion, the university made it an easy choice this year for freshmen. Of the minimum 12 hours a full-time student needs, it fulﬁ  lls three credits, which keeps students on a straight path toward graduating on time. It also is not meant to be a challenging class; a high grade is very feasible, which provides a nice GPA bump.
Graduate schools emphasize the need for well-rounded 
applicants. Being a math or science wiz is no longer a guaran-tee for admittance into top-level programs. Additional back-grounds in humanities classes are an extra boost on any ap-plication, proving that students know how to use both sides of their brains.
Although this class is a revolutionary idea, the university 
may not make students take it in the future. With such a large amount of students, it may not be possible for everyone to take it. People will fall through the cracks, or there may not be enough seats in classrooms to accommodate everyone. Also, it interferes with some of the more demanding majors’ critical tracking requirements. If the university offered it dur-ing Summer term, it may be more appealing.
The college experience involves trying new things and 
experimenting with new ideas. What is the Good Life? of-fers freshmen the opportunity to experience many cultures, meet people from across the university and tie history to the present.

An hour north of Gainesville, 
tucked down a road off Interstate 
10, there is a campground draped in Spanish moss, covered in horse hooves and home to one of Flori-da’s outdoor music festivals.
The Spirit of the Suwannee Mu-
sic Park & Campground in Live Oak is hosting its sixth Bear Creek Festival today through Sunday. Thousands of people will flock onto the 800-acre campground, and more than 60 funk and dance bands will perform on the various stages.
“We make people want to shake 
their asses,” director Paul Levine said.
Attendees are encouraged to 
camp out, Levine said. Campers will have access to five shower houses, 800 RV hookups and shade from the low-hanging oak trees.
“The music is part of the experi-
ence,” Levine said, “but also being outside and enjoying nature.”  
There are wedding chapels if a 
love connection sparks in the close-quartered tents — which Levine said has happened before.
However, if camping is too rug-
ged, Holiday Inn, Best Western and EconoLodge are right off I-10.
Aside from the music, activi-
ties are planned around the camp-ground, Levine said.
Festival attendees can partici-
pate in a disc golf tournament and food drive to benefit Love INC of Suwannee County, which aids Live Oak residents affected by Tropi-cal Storm Debbie, he said. A char -
ity auction will support Suwannee Spirit Kids Music Camps. 
Attendees can also dance at si-lent discos, go swimming in the Su-wannee River, watch visual artists create in the live art gallery and eat from a spectrum of food options.
Vendors will provide cuisine 
choices from Chinese to Greek to “the lobster roll guy,” Levine said. And in the spirit of camping, peo-ple can bring their own food, too.
Bands are scheduled to start at 
11 a.m. and end at 3 a.m., according to the website’s schedule.
Lotus, an electronic jazz-fusion 
group, is one of the headliners.
The band’s bassist, Jesse Miller, 
described its live performance as very energetic.“The crowd is always really get-
ting down,” Miller, 33, said. “People dance or just respond physically.”
Lotus, which will perform Fri-
day at midnight during the festival, was founded in 2001 at Goshen College in Indiana, and is made up of Jesse’s brother, Luke Miller, on guitar and keys; Mike Greenfield on drums; Chuck Morris on percus-sion; and Mike Rempel on guitar.
Eleven years later, the band has 
performed at festivals all over the country, been signed by Colorado-based SCI Fidelity Records and re-corded multiple albums and EPs, most recently its self-titled album. The band’s sound has changed with each album.
“We try to avoid the trappings 
of genre,” said Miller, who, along with his brother, writes many of the songs. “We’re very much a rock band, taking influence from electronic music, from instrumen-tal rock, from experimental things and try to blend it into something uniquely Lotus.”
Lotus primarily writes and per -
forms instrumental songs, Miller said, which leaves room for inter -
pretation through the music, not the lyrics.
“It’s much more abstract than topical,” he said. “If it’s instrumen-tal, the only kind of labeling you’re giving something is a song name.”
The Spirit of the Suwannee Mu-
sic Park is familiar to Lotus, which appeared at Bear Creek Festival in 2009 and Wanee Festival, spon-sored by the Allman Brothers Band, in 2011.
“That was interesting to see,” 
Miller said of Wanee Festival, where Lotus stood out as the band with a lot of synthesizers and gear.
“There were these Southern guys 
in the back with their arms crossed, and we start bopping around,” he said. “By the end of the set, every-one was getting into it.”
Next year, the band will tour the 
country, including many appear -
ances in Florida, he said.
For now, Miller said, the band 
looks forward to going back to Bear Creek Festival after being off the road most of fall.
Miller said the festival serves as 
a reunion where musicians collabo-rate and catch up, mentioning Um-phrey’s McGee, another headlining band that came out of Lotus’ region in Indiana.
Levine agreed, referencing Bear 
Creek’s relaxed environment as a catalyst for networking.
“More unique musical collabo-
rations happen at Bear Creek than anywhere,” he said.
Weekend passes, which include 
camping, are $185, and tonight’s pre-party tickets are $50.
Until the festival begins tonight, 
Levine is preparing Spirit of the Suwannee for the influx of people, and the bands are gearing up for three days of playing music, danc-ing to music and feeling the music.
“I think music is a language 
that’s deeper than spoken lan-guage,” Miller said, “and some-thing that people really connect to and feel.”

If you’re not a Gator, you’re Gator bait.
So far, the mascots of every team our 
Florida Gators have demolished are food sources for real Florida alligators.
In the wild, Albert and Alberta have 
diets that can include birds like those rep-resenting Bowling Green State University and University of South Carolina. Some-times, dinner may be a pet like the dogs of Texas A&M University and University of Tennessee, and the cats of the University of Kentucky, Louisiana State University and University of Missouri.  
This week, we face a new challenge 
that’s neither human nor animal: Cayenne. He is both a hot pepper and the mascot of our homecoming rival, Louisiana Univer -
sity at Lafayette.
Although it is unclear whether a Flor -
ida alligator would enjoy incorporating this kick into its diet, the “Ragin’ Cajuns” are undeniably Gator bait.
Here is a spicy recipe for Cayenne-
rubbed chicken with avocado salsa. There’s no better way to show our dominance as one of the most terrifying creatures in The Swamp than by devouring our opponent at a tailgate Saturday.
CAyENNE-RUbbEd CHICkEN WITH  
AVOCAdO SALSA
Ingredients:Coarse salt and ground pepper1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper4 boneless, skinless chicken breast 
halves, (6 to 8 ounces each)
2 tablespoons olive oil1 medium red onion, finely diced2 tablespoons fresh lime juice1 Hass avocado, pitted and cut into 
chunksdirections:In a small bowl, combine 1 teaspoon 
salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and cayenne; rub all over chicken.
In a large skillet, heat oil over medium 
heat. Add chicken, and cook until browned on the outside and opaque throughout — 8 to 10 minutes per side.
Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, com-
bine onion and lime juice and set aside. Just before serving, fold avocado chunks into onion mixture; season with salt and pepper. Serve chicken topped with salsa.

Tara Sokolow-Benmeleh has a pretty 
conventional beauty regimen. When she 
goes to the salon, she likes the nail polish on her fingers and toes to match.  
When she got her nails done at Porn 
Nails, Sokolow-Benmeleh chose a design that, for her, was a creative stretch.
She went for an orange-and-tan diag-
onal pattern with a rhinestone in the cen-ter of each nail. On her middle fingers, she exchanged the orange for gold tips.
Porn Nails is an interactive and rela-
tional art project by Rosemarie Romero, a 26-year-old third-year UF graduate student.
The project reclaims a liberated fe-
male sexuality in a way that uses humor and embodies empowerment, she said. At a typical event, she paints as many as 50 visitors’ nails.
About a year ago, Romero went 
through a difficult divorce, during which she dealt with misogyny and sexism.
“It’s the blame game,” she said, “and 
it’s always your fault.”
She saw other women struggling 
with similar issues, which had a pro-found impact on her.
She began working on Porn Nails in 
April. She does what she calls “mobile interventions,” by setting up a nail salon in unconventional spaces like lobbies, elevators and in her partitioned space at GRADhaus studios.
Her nail art isn’t for only women.Men especially like getting their nails 
done in the elevator. They find humor in saying “Do me next,” Romero said.
“Every guy’s fantasy is kind of, like, 
to do it in public,” she said. “They like the joke of somebody doing it in the el-evator.”
When she sets up her project, she 
decorates each space with colorful signs and props influenced by her Miami up-bringing and Dominican roots.
Romero often dresses up in colorful 
wigs and rollerblades and does her best to channel a traditional salon environ-ment so her guests feel comfortable.
“While I take care of them, they can 
express themselves and their lives and their history in a very open way,” Rome-ro said.
Sokolow-Benmeleh called Romero’s 
project therapeutic and said she believes it builds relationships and strength.
Romero has a selection of colors that 
range from neutral to metallic, includ-ing plenty of neon colors, which are her favorite. She funds Porn Nails out-of-pocket.
Recently , she began buying mini nail 
polishes because they’re easier to travel with. She also always carries different stickers, googly eyes, dollar sign-shaped sequins, glitter and rhinestones to use on nails. Each set of nails she does is differ -
ent.
“The porn in Porn Nails is not this 
chauvinistic, exploitative porn,” Romero said. “Your nails can be porn, too. It’s a statement to the world.”8, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2012

Lost in an endlessly 
growing queue and bur -
ied underneath thou-
sands of rows of titles, there are a few hidden gems of Netflix.
“Serenity” (2005)119 minutesFrom the mind of sci-
fi specialist Joss Whedon comes the space western “Serenity.” The story re-volves around the crew of the titular ship, head-ed by Malcolm Reyn-olds (played by Nathan Fillion, “Castle”), as they avoid the authori-tarian galactic regime called “The Alliance.” The crew is searching the answers to unravel an Alliance conspiracy regarding the danger -
ous and unpredictable psychic on board, River Tam (Summer Glau, “Firefly”), while being chased by a deadly Al-liance assassin known only as “The Opera-tive” (Chiwetel Ejiofor, “American Gangster”).
In this space epic, 
there are few lasers and futuristic-looking costumes. There are no aliens or bizarre worlds — only humans, guns with bullets, earth-look-ing planets and clothes that are reminiscent of the old west. This gives the atmosphere something unique in its genre. “Serenity” takes the general image of sci-fi space travel, and mix-es it with a more rustic and nostalgic feel.
The film is best ap-
preciated after watching the short-lived Fox cult series “Firefly,” which is on Netflix as well. It will give a better back-ground story of the set-ting that the film more or less skirts over. It also gives viewers a better relationship with the characters.
If you are a fan of 
Whedon, you’ve al-ready watched “Seren-ity” a dozen times. If you liked his most re-cent film, “The Aveng-ers,” and would like to see more, this is a great example of his talent.
Hidden gem you’ve 
already seen:
“Rugrats” (1994-2003)The adventures of 
Tommy Pickles and friends were amazing to watch when you were 4. They are even more awesome when you watch it in your 20s.

When her best friend’s father 
died in April, Ashley Yawn turned 
to Go Radio lyrics to express what she couldn’t say .    
“I put on ‘Redemption In The 
V erse,’ and played it as loud as my car stereo would allow,” she said. “We screamed the lyrics and cried together.”
The band that helped Yawn 
through a rough time will play to-night at High Dive with opening acts Paradise Fears and Stages and Stereos. Doors open at 7 p.m., and tickets are available for $12 at www.ticketweb.com.
In 2007, Go Ra-
dio was formed after vocalist Ja-son Lancaster left his former band, Mayday Parade.
The band’s most recent album, 
“Close The Distance,” was released in September.
Alex Reed, guitarist and vocalist 
for Go Radio, said the band couldn’t be “more excited and more satis-fied” with the new album. 
“Growth is something a band 
should constantly be doing,” he said. “This record is proof of our growth and what we have been through in our lives the last couple years.”
Reed said the inspiration for Go 
Radio’s music comes from the ad-versity the members have overcome throughout their lives.
“I don’t think we could make 
these songs up if we tried,” he said. “We actually live everything you hear.”

Max Cook recalls UF’s football game 
against the Kentucky Wildcats a bit differently from most people.
While Gator fans shuffled out of Ben Hill 
Griffin Stadium to the nearest parking lot, Cook, 24, transported a middle-aged couple uphill via rickshaw east on University Avenue just past 34th Street.
At one point, the male passenger got out 
to push the bicycle taxi up the hill as Cook pulled. The feat was strenuous but yielded Cook a handsome $40 tip. The female passen-ger apologized for the trouble.
Cook is a rickshaw driver for I’d Ride That, 
a local transportation company that drives passengers around Gainesville with a one-manned bicycle taxi.
The company was founded in May 2011 by 
Charlie Brown.
Brown, 24, said he saw a rickshaw for the 
first time in Charleston, S.C., seven years ago. He volunteered for AmeriCorps National Ci-vilian Community Corps at the time, aiding disaster recovery.
“I’ve been a biker all my life,” Brown said.  
“I saw a rickshaw, and I was like ‘Yeah, that’s what I want to do.’”
Brown is an Ocala native who moved to 
Gainesville about four years ago. He found a job opening as a rickshaw driver at Gainesville Rickshaws.
Brown said he was fired from Gainesville 
Rickshaws and started I’d Ride That in May 2011. He learned how to weld and enlisted the help of family friend Mike McClaine, who has a background in engineering, to build his first rickshaw. The company has five rickshaws and employs nine drivers.
He said that although he has worked every 
Gator football home game in the last three to four years, he has never been to one.
Cook said the company tends to cover 
most of the Midtown and downtown areas of Gainesville. The corner of Second Street and Main Street and the 17th Street area near Mid-town are particularly good sources of business. I’d Ride That employees can be distinguished by their signature yellow jerseys.
Customers do not usually request the com-
pany’s services by phone. Instead, pedestrians find an I’d Ride That rickshaw driver on the street and ask for a ride.
Although I’d Ride That operates for Gator 
football games, the company also works at events in surrounding areas.
Cook said the company receives good 
business driving people in Jacksonville dur -
ing large-scale country concerts at Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Arena. I’d Ride That also works Jacksonville Jaguars football games.
“People go to these things expecting to pay 
some money ,” Brown said. “For me, it works out really well. I definitely hear some people say , ‘This is the most fun we’ve had the whole game.’”I’d Ride That goes to Tallahassee when the 
Gators play at Florida State University and were at this season’s game against the Univer -
sity of Georgia Bulldogs in Jacksonville.
Cook said low to moderate amounts of 
business bring the company $200 to $300 a night, while a particularly productive evening can yield about $600.
Brown said the standard rate is $5 to $10, 
depending on weight, distance to the destina-tion, workday  busyness and other miscella-neous factors. However, if business is slow, the drivers are open to bartering. Past payments include free T-shirts and pizza.
“This is the best job I’ve had so far,” Cook 
said. “It’s a very unique business. It teaches you how to work with people and keep a posi-tive attitude. It’s difficult to go back now.”
Brown said I’d Ride That sells company T-
shirts. Customers can have the shirts delivered to them if they live within Gainesville city lim-its. The shirts cost $10 each.

Dear Mediocre Advice,
What is some good advice you’ve received 
lately?
Ariel Barnes
Dear Friend,
I have many misunderstood techniques, 
but I will share a few with you: 1. I leave a trail of candy from a bar to my bedroom. 2. I go to a bar, snap my fingers, look around, point to the guy I want to bone, point to my vagina and then we leave together. 3. I walk into a bar with a mus-tache and pick up the first person who compliments my facial hair. That’s usually a telltale sign that he’s into the weird stuff. And, in case you were wondering, No. 3 
works best.  Dear Friend,
This morning, I got some great advice from 
Joe, a cashier at Publix. He checked my ID for the bottle of wine I was buying and said he also knew an Ariel, who is quite successful now. Then, he asked what I wanted to do as a profession. He could tell I was hesitant and said, “Only you can make your dreams come true.” Joe, with a small white heart next to his name on his name-tag, was correct. I pointed at him and said, “That’s right! Thank you!” Everyone should try to make small talk with the person cashing him or her out, whether it’s at a grocery store or wherever. You might get some 
pretty good advice.Dear Mediocre Advice,
What is your secret technique to get a man in bed?Dear Friend,
When someone gives you something for free, do you say, “go F yourself?” No. I’d say, “Hey, life. Thanks. That’s cool of you to go out of your way to give me these lemons and s---.” But then, I’d lean in really close and say “I swear if you cross me later when I’m trying to get a real job, I will shove these lemons up your ass,” 
and then walk away with the lemons.Dear Mediocre Advice,
If life gives you lemons, would you 
make lemonade or tell life to go F itself?
Dear Mediocre Advice,
If there was such a thing as a sex ninja, what would be the qualifica -
tions, who would qualify, and who would be the master of that dojo?
Dear Friend,
I don’t think we are picturing the same thing when you say “sex ninja.” Ninjas are supposed to be sneaky, and I don’t know 
why anyone would want to have sneaky sex, unless it’s in a public bathroom or at Library West. I just googled ninjas for the past half hour, and from the research I’ve gathered, a ninja is someone who is skilled in Japanese martial arts, is super stealth and uses unconventional tactics to spy and assassinate. When I combine that with sex, the only person who comes 
to mind is James Bond. James Bond is the Sex Ninja Master, and no one else qualifies, because no one is as cool as him.BUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

  Leading the team in tackles is 
nothing for Josh Evans. 
  He has dealt with challenges that 
extend beyond the gridiron, and his 
support system helped him become the team leader he is today.
  Evans revealed in October that 
his mother died of cancer when he was in eighth grade.  
  Now, the New Jersey native has 
Hurricane Sandy on his mind. His family has been without power since the storm made landfall on Oct. 29.
  Evans depends on his father 
and his teammates to help pull him through hardship.
  “My roommate, Jelani Jenkins, 
is also like a brother to me,” Evans said. “We talk about ball or school all the time. I’d probably say fami-ly, coaches and friends were a main factor in me going out and having a good season so far.”
  Evans said he has transformed 
from an immature player to one who devotes more time to studying ﬁ  lm and meeting with coaches.
  After a hamstring injury ham-
pered Evans during his junior sea-son, he has started every game his senior year.
  Evans is second on the team 
with two interceptions and ﬁ  rst with 62 tackles. Linebacker Jon Bos-tic is next with 52.
  Evans ranks ﬁ  fth in tackles 
among Southeastern Conference defensive backs.
  “He’s just a better overall foot-
ball player,” Buck linebacker Ler-entee McCray said. “He’s a better safety. He’s a better person. He’s a better everything. He just worked to develop his craft. He’s gotten a lot better.” 
  Defensive coordinator Dan 
Quinn pointed to Evans’ offseason strength work as a reason for im-provement. Quinn is pleased with Evans’ results.

  Jelani Jenkins has struggled to stay 
on the ﬁ  eld this season, but he will not 
let his injuries discourage him.
  The junior, who has started the 
past three games, missed three games earlier this season due to a fractured thumb and a pulled hamstring. He left two other games early because of the hamstring injury. 
  Before 2012, Jenkins missed only 
one game — a 26-21 win against Van-derbilt on Nov. 5, 2011, that he sat out due to a concussion suffered the previ-ous week. 
  “It’s been tough, but I trust the ath-
letic training staff,” Jenkins said. “They got me back on the ﬁ  eld as quickly as possible. They’ve done a great job at it. (I’m) just doing the best I can. I’m happy the way the season is going.”
  Defensive coordinator Dan Quinn 
said that even when Jenkins was on the sidelines, the weakside linebacker contributed.
  “He has very good football smarts 
and wanted to be in and help the other players that stepped up when he went 
down,” Quinn said. “It wasn’t like he removed himself or wasn’t involved, so I 
thought that was a real tribute as a team guy and a leader saying, ‘I’m out, and I can’t play, but I’m certainly go-ing to be here and help the guys that are playing.’”
  Jenkins recorded a sack last week 
against Missouri. He has notched 16 tackles and two sacks this season.
  
  Injury Update: Defensive tackle Leon Orr, running back Mack Brown and wideout and returner Andre Debose will all miss Saturday’s game against Louisiana, coach Will Muschamp said Junior linebacker pushing 
through  injuries for Gators END OF GREGULATION
  Florida’s success in 2012-13 will hinge on 
the play of four wild cards. 
  Mike Rosario, Casey Prather, Brax-
ton Ogbueze and Michael Frazier II are un-knowns. If all four are duds, the Gators will struggle to generate offense.
  But if one or two can turn into a top-ﬂ  ight 
offensive threat, Florida could be in line for a special year.  
  One of coach Billy Donovan’s biggest chal-
lenges this season will be ﬁ  nding consistent scoring options. 
  Given that Kenny Boynton has a strong 
chance to ﬁ  nish his career as UF’s all-time leading scorer, Florida’s ability to ﬁ  ll it up wouldn’t seem to be in question. 
  Although Boynton led the team in scoring 
last season, the offense ran mostly through Er-ving Walker and Brad Beal, neither of whom will be back this year. 
  Boynton’s scoring could even decrease as 
he plays more minutes at point guard and at-tempts to become a distributor. Either way, Donovan’s teams have never been about one player carrying the offensive load. 
  So who is going to step up?  Fans have been waiting for Patric Young to 
show up with a dominant post game to match his imposing physicality, but don’t hold your breath.  Young and Donovan have both said Young’s focus remains on defense, rebound-ing and running the ﬂ  oor — not becoming a more potent option offensively. 
  Erik Murphy av-
eraged double-ﬁ  gure points by drilling 59 threes last season, but don’t expect those 
looks to come as easily with Beal and Walker out of the picture. Donovan has praised Mur-phy’s improved physicality and post moves, but after two seasons of watching Murphy do little aside from hang on the perimeter, I’ll be-lieve it when I see it. 
  Scottie Wilbekin is taking over at point 
guard, and according to all the chatter, he’s improved his ability to drive and hit the three. But for the past two seasons he’s been involved in a lower percentage of offensive possessions than anyone else on the roster, so I don’t see him suddenly carrying the load. 
  This means the Gators will have to rely on 
one of four breakout candidates to step for-ward. 
  Rosario seemed like the most likely choice 
a week ago, but he turned the ball over four times and missed badly on all three of his tries from beyond the arc in Thursday’s exhibition. The talented but mercurial redshirt senior has  UF needs scorers to emerge  SEE EVANS, PAGE 15

Debose has yet to return to

Although Debose has just 
two receptions this season, he has been the Gators’ primary kick and punt returner. He leads the team with 479 combined re-turn yards. Omarius Hines re-turned kicks and De’Ante Saun-ders fielded punts on Saturday.
Brown suffered an ankle in-

Not looking ahead: The Ragin’ 
Cajuns are tied for fourth in 
the Sun Belt Conference, but the Gators are not taking them lightly.
“When we put on the tape of 
Louisiana, it really showed this is a very good offense,” Quinn said. “Whatever conference they’re in, throw the conference out.”
Louisiana ranks 44th in the nation in total offense and pass-ing yards per game. In a 40-24 win against Louisiana-Monroe last week, the Ragin’ Cajuns gained 607 yards.“Any team that can do that, 
you’ve definitely got to pay at-tention to,” Jenkins said.

Frazier led UF with 21 points 
in UF’s exhibition win against Ne-braska-Kearney, proving only that he has elite range and can hit open shots. 
Ogbueze also made an impres-
sive debut, showing explosive-ness and athleticism en route to 15 points. Boynton said Ogbueze could be the type of scoring point guard the Gators need, but it was just one game against Division II competition. Donovan loves the effort of the two freshmen, but he cautioned against buying into one good day.
Prather flashed in the NCAA 
Tournament last season, and his athleticism is undeniable. But he’s never curbed the turnover prob-lem, and two concussions in nine days smells like the start of a long-term issue.
The Gators should be a great 
defensive team, but the offense will lag behind unless an unex-pected contributor can rise to the challenge.

French-born Florent Diep has lived in the 
United States for less than a year, but he has 
flourished at Florida. 
Diep has solidified himself as a key play-
er for the Gators and will look to build on that start this weekend at the USTA/ITA National Indoor Intercollegiate Champion-ships, one of the collegiate Grand Slam tour -
naments.
Life in the U.S. has not been easy for 
Diep.
He faced many challenges after arriving 
at UF in January, including a new school and a new language.
“I didn’t speak English,” Diep said. “With classes and everything, it was really, really tough.”
Before transferring to Florida, Diep 
played in professional tournaments and was rated as high as No. 673 in the world. But Diep’s struggles adjusting to life in the U.S. translated directly to his play on the court.
“My first semester was really odd,” Diep 
said. “I didn’t play good.”
When first-year coach Bryan Shelton ar -
rived in June, he noticed obstacles Diep was trying to overcome. 
“His transition here his first semester 
was difficult,” Shelton said. “Obviously, the language was something he had to develop over time. His English wasn’t great when he arrived, and he had to adjust to college life in the United States, being a French guy.”During his second semester, Diep got 
more comfortable, and the results have shown in his play. Diep won the USTA/ITA Southeast Regionals two weeks ago.
“He has now made that adjustment, so he 
is more comfortable when he comes out on the court,” Shelton said. “He is more confi-dent in what he can do out there and has a better understanding of his game.”
Diep is one of Florida’s key players in both singles and doubles. After playing in both collegiate and professional tournaments this fall, Diep has assumed a leadership role for the Gators. Shelton sees Diep continuing his tennis career beyond his stint in Gainesville.
“Flo not only wants to play well for the 
Gators,” Shelton said. “He wants to contin-ue to develop as a player so he can go on to play professionally when his career is done here.”
But for now, Diep is focused on the task at 
hand, which is competing in New York.
Diep will face Baylor’s Julian Lenz in the 
first round on Thursday afternoon.
“I’m really excited to be able to play this 
tournament and try to do my best to rep-resent the Gators the best that I can,” Diep said.

Safety showing improved tackling in 2012
improve his defensive calls.
He entered this season with a chip on his shoulder. 
Evans wasn’t pleased after recording only 10 tackles 
and one interception in the first four games of the 2011 campaign.
The senior recorded 26 stops during the same span 
in 2012.
“We bring him down in the box and as a tackler 
he is more physical,” Quinn said. “The tape shows that. I think the second thing — and I really noticed it when we started spring practice — his communica-tion and the mental quickness needed for safety really improved. He had better recall of the calls and had the adjustment faster.”
Quinn, also from New Jersey, gives Evans a mentor 
outside of football. The two share conversations about more than just his improved play.Coach Will Muschamp named Evans the defensive 
player of the game after the senior recorded a career-high 12 tackles and an interception in Florida’s win against Missouri.
Muschamp cannot remember a missed tackle from 
the safety this season, which he said is critical coming 
from the last line of defense.
“Josh is a tough young man,” 
Muschamp said. “He’s a guy that will throw his eyes in there 
all the time.”
Evans isn’t just watching out for oncoming ball car -
riers. His last two home games in The Swamp await him, with the first coming against Louisiana on Satur -
day. 
“It’s going to be very emotional,” Evans said. “You 
come in, and you never think these four years are going to go by so fast, but here it is before my eyes.”

DIVISION II OPPONENT. 
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Writer
After Florida’s exhibition rout of 
Nebraska-Kearney on Nov. 1, coach 
Billy Donovan expressed concern about his team’s rebounding.  
The Gators only outrebounded 
the Lopers 32-29. Division II UNK does not have a player taller than 6 feet 7 inches. 
“Clearly, from a talent stand-
point and a size standpoint, we had a huge advantage over them,” Donovan said. “I just saw time and time again our older veteran guys getting beat off the dribble and not rebounding.”
Five days later, Donovan again 
criticized his team’s effort on the glass. 
“We don’t leave the floor,” Don-
ovan said. “We are the best on-the-floor rebounding team in the coun-try. … Unfortunately, while our guys are standing on the ground, somebody else is jumping.”
UF ranked sixth in the South-
eastern Conference averaging only 35.7 rebounds per game last season. The Gators’ plus-2.8 rebounding margin ranked 79th in the country. 
No player on Florida’s roster 
last year averaged more than seven rebounds per game. Center Patric Young finished the season with 6.4 boards per contest, while power forward Erik Murphy averaged 4.5.  
Against Nebraska-Kearney, 
Young and Murphy combined for seven rebounds in 40 minutes. Only two came on offense. 
“That’s not good enough,” Don-
ovan said. “They’ve got to come down with it. They’ve got to go hard after it.” 
As the Gators struggled to re-
bound the ball against the Lopers, Will Yeguete excelled. The 6-foot-7 forward finished with 11 rebounds and grabbed five offensive boards — almost half of the team’s total. 
“Where are the rest of these 
guys?” Donovan said. 
No. 10 Florida’s rebounding will 
be put to the test when UF squares off against Georgetown on Friday night in the Navy-Marine Corps Classic in Jacksonville.
Due to cold and windy weather 
conditions on the deck of the USS Bataan at the Naval Station May-port, Donovan expects both squads to struggle shooting. 
Allowing second-chance oppor -
tunities could be detrimental. 
“It’s been a point that’s really 
been pounded on, but we’re play-ing against a team in Georgetown that is very long, very athletic,” Donovan said. “This is going to really, really expose what kind of commitment we’ve made to re-bounding.”16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 8, 2012

The bump Viktorija Dimai-
te took in Saturday’s practice 
may have seemed ordinary to the untrained eye. 
Coach Amanda Butler 
knew otherwise. 
Dimaite will miss the sea-
son after suffering tears to the ACL and medial meniscus in her left knee.
She will undergo surgery 
after Thanksgiving.
“You have seen ACLs tear 
before where it was just slight and awkward enough that it seems like nothing,” Butler said. “Unfortunately, I have a little bit of a trained eye.”
While going through a low-
post drill Saturday, a team-mate hit Dimaite from the side, and she fell to the floor. 
She was examined by Dr. 
Kevin Farmer, who decided an MRI would be necessary. Following a test on Monday, Dimaite found out her season was finished before it even be-gan.
“It’s great evidence that we 
can have great plans as play-ers or coaches and sometimes our timing is not what mat-ters,” Butler said. 
The injury is another set-
back for the native Lithuanian. Last season, Dimaite planned to redshirt to get stronger be-fore she suffered a dislocated right ankle while preparing for the 2011 Under-20 Euro-pean Championships. This season, she was expected to be a major contributor for the Gators.
“She had been practicing 
really well,” redshirt junior Lily Svete said. “We really did have high expectations for her.”
D i m a i t e 
is the third member of the current 
Gators ros-ter to suffer an ACL tear.
S v e t e 
and redshirt f r e s h m a n 
Carlie Needles each previous-ly received a medical redshirt due to similar injuries.
Athletic trainer John Bar-
rett said women are more susceptible to the injury than men. 
“Women’s hip structures 
are inherently differently set up than men’s because they are child-bearing creatures,” he said. “Because of that, it puts more stress on the knees.”
Butler said Dimaite is dis-
appointed but confident she will be ready to return next season.
“We’ve cried and been sad 
the past few days, but then you have to choose to recov-er,” Butler said. “That’s what we’ll see her do.”UF’s trend of ACL
