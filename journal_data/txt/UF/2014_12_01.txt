FLORIDA STATE 24 FLORIDA 19

TALLAHASSEE — Outside Doak 
Campbell Stadium lie the graves of the 
conquered. Florida State’s Sod Cemetery serves as the football program’s trophy case, boasting the buried battlegrounds from some of the Seminoles’ most memo-rable victories.
On the 11 plots of dirt that marked the 
demise of Florida teams in the past, orange and blue ﬂ  owers welcomed Will Mus-champ to a resting place of his own.
But unlike the clumps of opposing 
school’s turf that remain memorialized with a plaque and guarded with a steel-iron fence, Muschamp’s ﬁ  nale at Florida won’t earn a spot in FSU’s museum of suc-cess — only the best of the team’s road vic-tories called for a place among history.
Instead, the ﬁ  nal memories of Mus-
champ’s 24-19 loss on Saturday will lie trapped within the famous brick-ornament-ed walls of The Doak, where the four-year head coach of the Gators became America’s latest victim of unemployment to the thun-derous bursts of cheers and ﬁ  reworks.
The circumstances surrounding the con-
test played into the typical Muschamp-ion script of falling short with the promise of moving ahead. When the Gators were set up with a chance to succeed, they stumbled to follow through in critical scenarios.
“We’ve had our opportunities,” Mus-
champ said. “You look at two other games where we had the game in hand and had our opportunities to get it done and we didn’t get it done. It falls on my shoulders, and that’s why they’re going to be looking for a coach.”
Although a last hurrah from the down-
and-out Gators would have served as an 
idealistic goodbye to Muschamp as it did for Ron Zook 10 years ago, an erased nine-point lead better symbolized the frustra-
tion of years past.
Success was just beyond the precipice 
but always out of reach.
So marks the tomb of the Muschamp 
era, a time that sprouted in hope until it was slowly crushed by reality.
“I’ve got to do a TV show tomorrow,” 
Muschamp said as he spoke to the media 
Saturday.
For every fairy-tale, Rudy-esque end-
ing in sports, there is an equally average

Shoppers are expected to check out online in record num-
bers this year.
About six in 10 people are expected to take advantage of 
Cyber Monday deals today, an increase of about 14 percent-
age points since 2010.
The ﬁ  ndings come from the AAA, which compiled a Con-
sumer Pulse Survey to analyze holiday shopping trends. With 91 percent of people expected to participate, the results sug-gest a busy season this year.Fourteen percent of participants said they planned on 
spending more on gifts, a 10 percentage point jump since 2008.
According to a press release from the AAA, the survey 
also found that about 28 percent of participants wait until the last two weeks of November to purchase gifts.Retailers attempt to lure in customers earlier each year, 
according to the release. This beneﬁ  ts of consumers because even though they’re spending more this year, they want a good deal.
The survey also found that participants plan on buying 
apparel and accessories more than any other type of gift, fol-lowed by gift cards, books, toys and jewelry.
UF telecommunication senior Michael Vensamoye said his 
college budget keeps him frugal for the holidays.
“I’m probably spending about the same as last year, if not 
a little less,” the 21-year-old said.Cyber Monday to attract more shoppers this year, survey saysKan Li / Alligator Staff

Penny and Clementine may smell like manure 
and make funny noises, but they still get weekly 
visits from Gainesville youth.
The animals of Morningside Nature Center — 
including Penny the cow and Clementine the hog —  poke their snouts out at curious children carry-ing handfuls of food during Barnyard Buddies, a 
weekly event at the farm.
The program has been going on for at least 20 
years, said Merald Clark, the farm’s nature assis-
tant. Tours take place every Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Children offer handfuls of hay and seed to the 
six sheep, two flocks of chickens, two hogs and one cow during this interactive petting zoo event.
“We’ve got these great animals. We feed them 
every day anyway, but why not take one day a 
week and let the young’uns help feed the animals, 
too?” Clark, 62, said.
Clark leads families around the barn, stopping 
at animal pens to mention fun facts and explain the proper way to feed them.
“To play in the dirt, to pet the cow and to have 
the little teeth of the sheep nibble on their hand as they’re getting to the corn — it’s just direct, sen-sual experience,” he said.
Any age group is welcome to visit the nature 
center, but most visitors are families with young children.
Other local organizations like O2BKids and 
city recreation centers often bring children to visit the farm, and numbers can reach up to about 100 
people, including adults, he said.  
During Barnyard Buddies, Clark said the cen-
ter implements all safety precautions for the ani-
mals and their visitors. Both chickens and hogs are separated from crowds by two fences, as the 
birds peck and the hogs can be aggressive and 
don’t see well. The children can toss the food from a distance.
“Fingers have never been hurt,” he said.Chelsie Papiez, 32, and her 9-month-old daugh-
ter, Ellinor, were visiting the nature center for the 
first time in early November.
“I think it’s great,” Papiez said. “I think many 
of us moms who are at home with kids need these 
outlets, especially getting the kids outside.”
Morningside Nature Center also hosts other in-
teractive farm events, like Farm Living for fourth- and fifth-graders and Farm Adventure for kinder-garteners and first graders.  
Danielle Durst, one of the mothers attending 
Barnyard Buddies, said she enjoyed watching her daughter see these animals for the first time.
“We’ve gone to the Santa Fe College Teach-
ing Zoo, but you don’t really get to feed and pet 
them,” she said.Barnyard Buddies provides farm 
fun for children on Wednesdays

feed them every day anyway, but why 
not take one day a week and let the 
young’uns help feed the animals, too?”

Juan Hincapie Castillo received 
an unexpected letter in the mail ear-
lier this month.
The graduate student in phar-
maceutical outcomes and policy 
was the first UF student to receive a 
Graduate Student Fellowship from the American Association of His-panics in Higher Education.
The fellowship is only awarded 
to 20 Hispanic students every year in the U.S.
Castillo, who received his phar-
macy degree from the UF College of 
Pharmacy in 2013, is now pursuing 
a doctorate degree in pharmaceuti-cal outcomes and policy. 
“I am interested in a career in aca-
demia, and I feel this fellowship will open a lot of doors,” the 24-year-old said.The fellowship will fund his at-
tendance to the association’s Gradu-ate Student Fellows Program na-
tional conference, he said.
The association chose recipients 
for the fellowship based on qualifi-
cations, including Hispanic origin, enrollment in a doctoral program, academic potential and aspirations for a career in academia.
Castillo will present his research 
on the safety of opioid analgesics in adolescents with chronic pain at the conference. Opioid analgesics are a 
type of drug used to reduce moder-
ate to severe pain, he said. He also studies the risk for development of substance abuse in adolescents.
He  said the conference will allow 
him to get feedback on his research and gather new ideas.
He became interested in these 
topics during his doctorate training, where he took elective courses about the topics, he said.
His adviser, Almut Winterstein, 
encouraged him to pursue his re-search in pharmacoepidemiology, 
which is the study of drug effects on 
a specific population, he said.
Winterstein said Castillo is a 
role model for students from South American countries who come to the U.S. for academics.
“He takes any opportunity for 
personal and professional growth (and) is highly motivated to both 
advance his career and contribute to 
society and science,” she said.Student receives Hispanic fellowship
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
FERGUSON, Mo. — Ferguson police Of-
ficer Darren Wilson did not receive a sev-
erance package when he resigned over the weekend, the St. Louis suburb’s mayor said Sunday.
Wilson, 28, won’t receive any further 
pay or benefits, and he and the city have cut their ties, Mayor James Knowles told re-porters a day after Wilson tendered his res-ignation, which was effective immediately.
Wilson, who is white, had been on ad-
ministrative leave since he killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, dur-ing an Aug. 9 confrontation.
A grand jury decided Monday not to in-
dict him, sparking days of sometimes vio-lent protests in Ferguson and other cities.
Wilson wrote in his resignation letter 
that his “continued employment may put the residents and police officers of the City of Ferguson at risk, which is a circumstance I cannot allow.”
His lawyer, Neil Bruntrager, told The 
Associated Press that Wilson decided to step aside after police Chief Tom Jackson told him about the alleged threats Satur-day.
“The information we had was that there 
would be actions targeting the Ferguson (police) department or buildings in Fer-guson related to the police department,” Bruntrager said.
He said Wilson, who had worked for 
the department for fewer than three years, and the city were already discussing an exit strategy, acknowledging that Wilson stay-
ing on as an officer there would be impos-
sible.
Many have criticized the authorities’ 
handling of the case, but Knowles said 
no leadership changes were in the works. Asked if he would resign, Jackson said flat-ly, “No.”
Benjamin Crump, an attorney for 
Brown’s family, said Wilson’s resignation was not a surprise.
“It was always believed that the police 
officer would do what was in his best in-terest, both personally and professionally,” Crump said. “We didn’t believe that he 
would be able to be effective for the Fer-
guson community nor the Ferguson Police 
Department because of the tragic circum-
stances that claimed the life of Michael 
Brown Jr.”
Crump said the family is still consider-
ing civil litigation such as a wrongful death 
lawsuit, “but don’t let that get confused with 
the fact that they really wanted the killer of 
their child to be held accountable.”
Victoria Rutherford of Ferguson said she 
believed Wilson should have not only re-
signed, but been convicted of a crime.
“I’m upset. I have a 16-year-old son. It 
could’ve been him. I feel that he was abso-
lutely in the wrong,” she said.
Others residents were more sympathet-
ic. Reed Voorhees said he hoped Wilson could find similar work “someplace where he would enjoy life and move on with his life.”Ferguson mayor: No severance package for Darren Wilson� BOTH ARRESTS WERE

A woman stabbed her boy-
friend in the chest after police 
said he punched her in the face early Thursday.
Tremia O. Brewer told 
Gainesville Police that shortly after 1:30 a.m., 28-year-old Der-ek Gean Stacey was chopping up crack cocaine — a substance Brewer told police Stacey sells — on a glass plate inside Brew-er’s home, located at 209 SE 26th Terrace, while Brewer was in the tub next to him. 
Brewer said Stacey — whom 
she has three children with — then began accusing her of cheating, so she walked into a bedroom. Stacey followed and punched Brewer in the face.
Brewer tried to leave. Later 
she reached into a drawer, grabbed a folding pocket knife 
and opened it. While holding 
it, she yelled, “Why you gotta keep putting your hands on me? If you come toward me, I’m going to stab you.”
Stacey then lunged toward 
Brewer, and Brewer stabbed him in the upper left chest.
Stacey then ran out of the 
house. When officers arrived, they saw Stacey lying in the front yard bleeding from his chest. He was arrested three days later on charges of battery and cocaine distribution within 1,000 feet of a park after be-ing treated for his injuries. His bond has not been set.
Stacey has a lengthy criminal 
history. In March 2008, he was arrested on charges of cocaine possession, narcotic equipment possession, resisting an officer and destroying evidence. In June 2009, he was arrested for allegedly assaulting someone with a deadly weapon.   

Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Office arrested a man Thursday after officers said he hit his girl-
friend, pulled her out of his car 
and pushed her to the ground.
Shortly after midnight, 21-
year-old Gauranga Das Nadler and his girlfriend of one month were at a restaurant off of Ar-cher Road. The victim told po-lice Nadler left without paying the bill because he was angry 
that the manager of the res-
taurant was talking to her. The woman was able to get Nadler to come back and pay his bill, but she said he was still angry.
Once inside of Nadler’s car, 
the woman said she sat in the back seat because she was afraid to sit next to him, according to a 
report. After the woman called 
a friend to pick her up, Nadler said, “If you’re gonna talk s**t, get out of my car.”
Nadler then turned around 
in his seat and began hitting the woman, according to the report. Officers said she had swelling and a small open wound on the 
side of her face.
Nadler then got out of the 
car, grabbed the woman by her 
jacket and pulled her out of the car. He then pushed her to the ground, hurting her ankle, ac-
cording to the report. She told 
police she was scared Nadler would run her over with the car before he sped off, leaving her alone at the Kangaroo gas station on 43rd Street.
An employee at the gas sta-
tion heard the woman scream-ing and came outside. The em-
ployee then carried the victim 
to the front of the store.
Nadler was arrested on 
charges of aggravated battery. His bond is set at $75,000. Police roundup: More 
crack, assault; battery
He stepped down Saturday
“It was always believed that the 
police officer would do what was in 
his best interest, both personally 
and professionally.”

UF students and faculty are 
reacting to President Barack 
Obama’s announcement on major  immigration reforms. 
On Nov. 20, Obama an-
nounced his three-step plan for immigration reform, which includes providing additional resources for border patrol of-ﬁ  cials, allowing graduates and high-skilled immigrants to remain in the U.S., and deal-ing with about 4 million immi-grants who have been living in 
the U.S. illegally. 
“After all, most of these 
immigrants have been here a 
long time,” Obama said in an-nouncement. “They work hard often in tough, low-paying jobs. They support their families.” 
The plan allows immigrants 
who have been in the U.S. for 
more than ﬁ  ve years without 
permission or who have Amer-ican-born children to pay taxes and pass background checks in exchange for temporary resi-dence for three years.
UF political science and Af-
rican studies senior Brianna Williams is an executive board 
member for UF Dream Defend-
ers. She said the plan is a “step in the right direction,” but there needs to be a long-term plan in motion.
“He basically just put a tem-
porary stamp on it and, in three years, when this deferred ac-tion goes out, then people will 
be in this same situation,” the 
20-year-old said.The plan could impact im-
migrants now in colleges across the country who were brought to the U.S. as children. 
Obama said people who 
have been living in the U.S. without permission who excel 
academically and profession-
ally in the U.S. should not be forced to leave the country.
Paul Ortiz, a UF associate 
history professor, said some UF students belong to families living in the U.S. without per-mission and constantly have to  deal with changing immigra-
tion statuses.
“What we’ve recognized 
here is that this issue of immi-
gration affects far more of our students and members of our community than we under-stand,” Ortiz said. 
There is also fervent debate 
around terms and dialogue 
used to discuss immigration 
reform, such as “illegal im-migrants.” Some people like Williams consider the term dis-criminatory and a misinterpre-tation of immigrants’ motives.
“I hate these labels that they 
put on people that dehumanize them,” Williams said. “They’re 
human beings that came here to

Ortiz said a long-term so-
lution to immigration reform should include the U.S. return-ing to the Ellis Island system in which immigrants would pass through customs and inspec-tions upon arrival.
“Let’s apply the same values 
to our immigration system now that we applied at an earlier time when we made the natu-ralization process much easier,” he said.UF reacts to Obama’s

Wreaths, ornaments, artwork 
and the faint ring of Christmas car-
ols were all present this weekend at the 50th Craft Festival 2014.
The festival was hosted at the 
Stephen C. O’Connell Center, where attendees and guests could purchase handcrafted items from more than 260 booths of nationwide artisans.
Families and students quickly 
packed both ﬂ  oors of the O’Connell Center Saturday morning, forming one of the biggest lines the venue had seen in the 22 years it has hosted 
the show at the center, said event co-
ordinator Tiffany Grifﬁ  th. 
“When we opened, we had the 
longest line we’ve ever had, so that was really exciting,” Grifﬁ  th said. Janie Graham, 43, was in atten-
dance at the festival and said she loves the atmosphere.
“Coming out and hearing Christ-
mas music is great,” Graham said. “The connection you get with people 
and the vendors is also really nice.”
This year was a ﬁ  rst for more 
than 60 vendors, but for Delores 
Cooley, owner of Kenco Arts and Crafts, 2014 marked her 20th year in attendance.
Cooley said the craft show has 
always brought her family together.She began selling Christmas crafts with her late husband and now sells them with her two daughters.
“We have so many people that 
come back every year to see what new things we have,” Cooley said. “All they have to do is look up and see all my Gator Christmas trees.”
Dot Updegraff, owner of Craft-
ing of Our Hearts LLC, sold candles 
and hand-painted woodcrafts for 
her ﬁ  rst appearance at the festival. 
“My husband does all the wood-
work, and I do all the painting,” Up-degraff said.
Grifﬁ  th said the festival may be 
taking a year off and then jumping back to business in 2016 due to fu-ture O’Connell Center renovations.
“Unfortunately, there’s just not 
a location in town that we’re able to relocate to temporarily, so we’ll be taking a year off,” Grifﬁ  th said.Christmas cheer brought to O’Dome
“My husband does all the 
woodwork, and I do all the 
painting.”

‘#BlackLivesMatter’ is used for a reason
One week ago, it was announced Darren Wilson 
would not stand trial for the death of an unarmed 
black 18-year-old named Michael Brown.
The failure to indict Wilson serves as a staunch re-
minder that our nation is far from being the post-racial society some would argue it is. The grand jury’s decision 
to not return an indictment demonstrates that in 2014, 
ﬁ  ring at least six bullets into an unarmed black body is not even worth further discussion, even when the inci-
dent is shrouded in conﬂ  icting evidence, witness testi-
mony and shady police activity.
To put this all into perspective, the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics reports there were 162,000 federal cases in 2010. Grand juries failed to return indictments in only 11 of 
them. The chances of Wilson being indicted were more 
than 99 percent, yet he still avoided even having to de-
fend himself in a trial for this now infamous shooting.
Many believe the decision is a grave injustice per-
formed by our nation’s legal system. Others believe the 
grand jury’s decision was the right one, supporting that 
Wilson had the right to use lethal force on an unarmed 
18-year-old because he felt his life was in danger. And still, some refuse to offer any opinion, and their silence 
— whether they know it or not — bolsters the status quo, 
saying the lives of people of color in this country matter 
less than the lives of white people.
The hashtag #BlackLivesMatter has garnered great 
popularity recently with members of the black commu-
nity and their allies, who are using it to speak out against the systematic killing of black people in the U.S.
Some people, though, have felt left out by #Black-
LivesMatter because they are not black. They argue that we shouldn’t be focusing on race as an issue in all of this and that we should be ﬁ  ghting for all lives because as the 
accompanying hashtag suggests, #AllLivesMatter.
While I wholeheartedly agree all lives matter, using 
#BlackLivesMatter is not a negation that other lives mat-
ter. The use of #AllLivesMatter does, however, detract from the issues being faced by black Americans today.Comedian Arthur Chu, no-
ticing how people were chang-ing #BlackLivesMatter to #All-LivesMatter on Twitter, asked 
his followers if they would run 
through a cancer research fund-
raiser and shout out “THERE 
ARE OTHER DISEASES TOO.” This is, essentially, what the 
#AllLivesMatter argument is. 
It’s saying we should not focus on the speciﬁ  c problems the black community faces because there are other prob-
lems with the world.
No one is going to contest that the world is a place 
ﬁ  lled to the brim with problems. But the problems faced by speciﬁ  c communities deserve their proper time to be 
addressed. They deserve to be heard, just as all problems 
deserve to be heard.
The next time someone tells you they believe #Black-
LivesMatter is an exclusionary statement, tell them it 
isn’t meant to be one. Their discomfort with the message 
is that it could very well be the ﬁ  rst time they are ever receiving the message black lives do, in fact, matter. Be-
cause for the most part, we are all taught that life matters. 
But have you ever stopped to really give thought to what 
it means? It means black lives matter, brown lives matter, 
queer lives matter, trans lives matter, disabled lives mat-
ter and everyone else who you can think of matters, too.
If you believe all lives matter, and black lives are in-
cluded in that “all,” then what is the issue with proclaim-ing that black lives matter?
#BlackLivesMatter is meant to remind mainstream 
society that black lives are members of that “all.” Your 
discomfort should not lie in a trending topic. Your dis-
comfort should instead lie in the injustices happening in 
this country, forcing this reminder.

efﬁ  ciency, favors 
utility companies
On Election Day, Florida voters overwhelmingly approved 
Amendment 1, the proposal that created a permanent source of funding for environmental conservation. The 
outcome of this vote demonstrated the importance Floridians have placed on sustainability and the environment.
On Tuesday, state regulators on the Public Service Commis-
sion completely ignored those priorities when they voted to slash Florida’s energy efﬁ  ciency standards for Florida’s utility companies by more than 90 percent. The commission also de-cided to eliminate Florida’s solar power rebate programs by the end of 2015.
According to the Tampa Bay Times, these votes by the com-
mission mirrored proposals presented by Florida energy giants Duke Energy Florida, Tampa Electric and Florida Power & 
Light. The companies claimed  the energy efﬁ  ciency standards 
and solar rebate programs were too expensive and those high costs would be passed on to ratepayers.
By ﬁ  ghting the expansion of solar energy in Florida, these 
major utility companies are taking a page out of the Koch broth-ers’ playbook. In states like Oklahoma, Ohio and Arizona, po-litical groups supported by the Kochs have spent vast sums of money on anti-solar campaigns. Energy corporations often re-fer to renewable energy programs and efﬁ  ciency standards as 
“disrupting factors.” They claim such initiatives “disrupt” their 
environmentally harmful and unsustainable yet massively prof-itable business model. However, the standards and solar rebates do not seem to have taken a toll on these companies’ bottom lines — in the third quarter of 2014 alone, Duke Energy earned $1.3 billion in proﬁ  t. Clearly, continuing the relatively modest energy efﬁ  ciency programs of the Sunshine State would do little to threaten the ﬁ  nancial stability of these energy giants.
The Times also quoted PSC chairman Art Graham as saying  
he was concerned “about how some of the low-income people would participate” in the solar rebate program.
If chairman Graham is truly concerned about the interests 
of low-income Floridians, the solution would be to support an expansion of the solar rebate program, not a vote to eliminate it.
This is far from the ﬁ  rst time the PSC has handed out favors 
to the Florida energy industry. Last year, the commission ap-proved Duke Energy’s construction of a new, $1.5 billion natural gas power plant in Citrus County.
The commission may see legal challenges to its votes last 
week by environmental groups, which claim that the PSC vio-lated state law by failing to maintain energy efﬁ  ciency require-ments for Florida’s utility companies.
Ivan Penn of the Times wrote that, after eliminating the solar 
rebate programs, the commissioners of the PSC agreed to “hold workshops on ways to improve solar energy in the Sunshine State.”
This is the way energy policy works in Florida: The corporate 
interests get everything they want, and Florida voters concerned about sustainability and the environment get “workshops.”

Two years ago in Mobile, Alabama, 
an 18-year-old white male, Gilbert Collar, was shot and killed by a 
black campus police ofﬁ  cer. He was running around campus, high and na-
ked, when he approached the ofﬁ  cer at the campus 
police station. Collar was unarmed, but the ofﬁ  cer still deemed him a threat and decided to use deadly force against him.
The ofﬁ  cer faced a grand jury and was not indict-
ed for his actions. Sound familiar?
Residents of Ferguson, Missouri, faced a similar 
situation where a white police ofﬁ  cer fatally shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old. This 
ofﬁ  cer was also not indicted by a St. Louis County 
grand jury, which caused many in the community to feel outrage and disappointment. I’m not sure if this is how people felt about Collar’s death in Ala-bama because almost no media coverage was given to this similar situation, but I’m assuming they also felt a pang of injustice. Given the strong similarities between these two unfortunate deaths, you would think the reactions to these tragedies would also be 
similar. You’d be wrong.  
When news of Collar’s death reached the stu-
dents at the University of South Alabama, staged 
protests put into question police brutality and how unaccountable the authorities sometimes are for their actions. These protests were peaceful and al-lowed people to engage in their First Amendment right.
When news of the indictment decision was re-
leased on Nov. 24 in Ferguson, residents responded in the wrong way and began destructive riots, which led to many businesses being ransacked and burned, cars being ﬂ  ipped over and set on ﬁ  re, and police be-ing intimidated and attacked. The Constitution al-lows for free speech but not in the manner in which Ferguson residents responded. They simply were mad about the grand jury’s decision and decided to take it out on businesses, buildings and people 
who had nothing at all to do with Brown or the po-
lice ofﬁ  cer. In the process of their ill-fated attempt to get “justice” for Brown, they demolished their own community and economy.
Their anger over the indictment decision is un-
derstandable, as it is sometimes perceived by some people that police ofﬁ  cers get away with almost anything and face no consequences. Grand juries are known to almost always come back with an 
indictment against regular citizens, which inspired the phrase professing that grand ju-
ries would “indict a ham sandwich.” However, there are  instances where police ofﬁ  cers are not charged with potentially wrongful deaths or injuries 
and people feel police are given special treatment and go unpunished for unwarranted deaths.
This mindset is perfectly justiﬁ  able. However, 
I believe we should step back for just a moment. It is important that police ofﬁ  cers answer for their ac-tions if it is merited, but we also cannot make ofﬁ  cers afraid to do their jobs. If we set the precedent that ofﬁ  cers will always face prosecution for defending themselves or other citizens, we will also start to see 
a passive reaction from cops as they begin to neglect 
doing their jobs in fear of being found guilty for do-ing them. In neighborhoods with high crime rates, this dispassionate response from ofﬁ  cers could lead to even more crime.
At the same time, accountability for public sec-
tor workers, such as police ofﬁ  cers, needs to happen to allow for transparency. Just as some promote, as I do, merit pay for teachers based on student per-
formance and other standards, we should promote 
a system where police ofﬁ  cers are open to the public eye and where their legitimacy is veriﬁ  ed. One way of accomplishing this is with police body cameras, where ofﬁ  cers on duty wear a camera that ﬁ  lms ev-erything they do.
Some concerns with body cameras exist, such 
as citizen and police privacy, but I believe the cost-beneﬁ  t analysis of a body camera system would 
show it to be a good idea. The Police Foundation has 
found that the use of body cameras on cops leads to reduced use of force and complaints against of-ﬁ  cers, which is good for everybody. It could also be used to verify if deadly police force was justiﬁ  ed for a particular case, which could have been helpful in a situation like Brown’s where everybody’s recollec-tion of the incident was different.
The deaths of both Collar and Brown warranted 
an investigation into developing policing reform, yet Collar’s death wasn’t enough. We had to wait for another death with circumstances that were more interesting to the national media to begin the dialogue. All lives matter, no matter someone’s skin color or economic background, so let’s continue to push peacefully for policing reform that could pre-vent potentially unnecessary deaths in the future.

Although Presi-
dent Barack Obama’s plan 
to allow millions of immigrants to live and 
work in the U.S. may anger some 
Americans, this plan will beneﬁ  t the country in the long run. The broad overhaul of the U.S. immigration enforcement system will protect up to 5 million unauthorized immi-grants from deportation.
Obama will announce a plan 
to overhaul the nation’s immigra-
tion system, according to The New 
York Times. The plan will provide immigrants with work permits, al-lowing them to stay in the U.S., as well as protecting the parents of legal American children. Families will no longer have to worry about their discovery or the threat of sep-aration.
According to a study executed 
by the Migration Policy Institute, this plan would provide relief for an estimated 11.7 million people living in the country without per-mission. The Obama administra-tion would expand the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals pro-gram, extending deferred action to 
new populations and reﬁ  ning the 
enforcement priorities to shrink the pool of those who would face de-portation.
The study also found that an 
estimate of 3 million people living in the country without permission lived in the U.S. for 15 or more years as of 2012. About 5.7 million 
people have lived in this country 
without legal permission for at least 10 years and 8.5 million for at least ﬁ  ve years.
Current border pa-
trol and immigration efforts trying to keep people out at the U.S. 
and Mexico border have not been effective. The study provided evi-dence that this method was not a strong way to approach the situ-ation of living in the country ille-gally. 
By narrowing the deﬁ  nition of 
“recent illegal entrants” to individ-uals apprehended within just one 
year of entering U.S. borders, there 
would be an estimated 232,000 re-duction of removals. Excluding non-citizens exclusively convicted of trafﬁ  c offenses and nonviolent crimes would reduce removals by almost half a million people.
The criteria for deferred action 
includes the length of U.S. resi-
dence, close family ties to American 
citizens, legal permanent residents or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals beneﬁ  ciaries, or the poten-tial eligibility for a green card as the immediate relative of a U.S. citizen.
Time magazine reported that 
an expert said Obama’s actions to defer deportations won’t result in 
an increase of people living in the 
country illegally. Doris Meissner, director of the Migration Policy In-stitute’s immigration policy work, told Time magazine that evidence has shown the number of people living in the country without per-mission across the Southwest bor-der is at its lowest level since the 
early ’70s.

Gators in the NFL
Tight end Jordan Reed had nine catches for 123 
yards in the Washington Redskins’ 49-27 loss to the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday.Taylor Unroe was one of three UF volleyball seniors honored on Wednesday. Read the story on Page 14.TALLAHASSEE — As Treon Harris lined the 
Florida offense up with fourth and the ball-game to go, I scanned the crowd of 82,485 at Doak Campbell Sta-dium. My eyes met brieﬂ  y with a female Florida State fan, and she smiled at me. It wasn’t one of those happy smiles, it was a nervous one, an “oh crap there’s still a chance we might lose this game,” kind of smile. I just assumed she was new around these parts. Perhaps she had woken from a coma last Sunday and this was her ﬁ  rst FSU game this season.
And surely she hadn’t seen Flor-
ida play anytime in the last four years. 
Minutes later the ﬁ  reworks were 
going off, and Tallahassee native T-
Pain’s “All I do is Win” was blaring 
over the celebratory din of Doak. 
The song’s meaning becomes more 
applicable for FSU as the weeks go 
by.
For 28 straight games, all the 
Seminoles have done is win. 
Set the adversity up, Florida 
State will knock it down. 
This time it was a formidable 
Florida pass defense that forced 
Heisman winner Jameis Winston into the worst game of his career, with a career-high four inter-ceptions. He remind-ed you that he’s still the most naturally tal-ented quarterback in college football with plays like the pretty back shoulder throw 
to receiver Rashad Greene and the touchdown strike to tight end Nick O’Leary.
But at one point, Winston had 
more completions to Gators than he did Noles, he wasn’t at his best Saturday night.
Instead, the team in garnet and 
gold did things a different way on offense as it rode freshman Dal-vin Cook to the tune of 144 yards, putting him six away from being 
the ﬁ  rst FSU player to rush for 
150 yards since Florida State’s win 
against Wake Forest on Sept. 15, 
2012. FSU also gained more yards 
on the ground than through the air 
for the ﬁ  rst time this season and 
scored a defensive touchdown on a 
94-yard pick six.
While the Seminoles found an-
other way to win, the Gators for the umpteenth time under Will Mus-
champ found a way to lose.
This time, it was death by a 
thousand ﬁ  eld goals, or at least it seemed like it. Austin Hardin at-
tempted six and missed two.
Florida consistently squandered 
unbelievably good ﬁ  eld position against Florida State. UF only ad-vanced the ball into the redzone once from drives that didn’t begin already inside of it. Florida had 14 drives total — none of which start-ed farther back than its own 22-yard line — and 19 points out of an effort

As a typical rivalry week goes 
in college football, nothing goes as 
expected. Let’s take a look back at the ﬁ  nal week of the regular season and see how it affects Champion-ship Saturday next weekend. 
SEC Least: The Southeastern 
Conference Eastern Division, arguably one of the most un-impressive divisions in college football, had a horrible week-end against its traditional out-of-conference rivals. To put hor-rible in to perspective, four SEC East teams — South Carolina, Florida, Georgia and Kentucky — all went 0-4 against their an-nual Atlantic Coast Conference opponents. 
South Carolina got drubbed 
35-17 by Clemson, and on top of that Clemson’s quarterback De-shaun Watson was announced after the win that he played with a partially torn ACL.
Georgia lost in overtime to 
Georgia Tech, and Kentucky lost 44-40 to Louisville, who picked off quarterback Patrick Towles late to hold off the Wildcats. The last loss from the SEC East came from Florida, falling 24-19 against No. 3 Florida State, who will face Tech in the ACC Championship next week. 
Perhaps the lone bright spot 
for the conference came on Fri-day afternoon as Missouri beat Arkansas to clinch the SEC East title—the Tigers’ second East crown in just its third year in the conference. 
Iron and Egg Bowls Didn’t 
Disappoint: Two of the biggest games of the weekend were from two SEC West rival games in Auburn-Alabama and Ole

FIRST AND SECOND ROUNDS OF THE TOURNAMENT.
EDEN OTERO
Alligator Staff Writer @edenotero_l
The Florida volleyball team 
earned the No. 8 seed in the 2014 
NCAA Tournament on Sunday 
and will serve as one of 16 hosts 
for the ﬁ  rst and second rounds of this year’s tournament.
Florida 
(25-3) will face Ala-bama State 
(20-18) in the ﬁ  rst round in the O’Connell Center and will also 
host Central Florida (25-7) and 
Miami (21-8).
This year marks Florida’s 24th consecutive appearance in the 
NCAA Tournament under head 
coach Mary Wise. 
It is also the 22nd time the 
Gators will host the opening rounds under Wise.
The top-four seeds of this 
year’s tournament are Stanford, Texas, Washington and Wiscon-sin. Stanford ﬁ  nished the regu-
lar season 29-1 and is the No. 1 
ranked team in the NCAA.
Texas, Washington and Wis-
consin are also among the top-5 
teams in the country.
Florida ﬁ  nished the 2014 regu-
lar season with 20 straight wins, 
which included an undefeated 
18-0 record in SEC play for the 
ﬁ  rst time since 2010 and a ﬁ  ve-set victory against No. 2 seed Texas on Saturday.Florida earns No.8 seed

@edenotero_l, @J_Mcpherson1126
At the start of the season, UF volleyball coach Mary Wise called her three 
seniors — Taylor Unroe, Holly Pole and Maddy Monserez — worker bees.
“The amount of work they have put in over the past four years to im-
prove their game and to make each other better,” Wise said at UF’s media 
day on Aug. 14. “What has been so special is watching how invested they are in each other’s improvements.” 
And on Wednesday, the Gators honored their three seniors prior to their 
final Southeastern Conference match of the regular season against South Carolina. Those three seniors all come from Florida’s backline and have served as the stabilizers for the Gators this season.
The senior-laden defense has limited opponents to a .162 hitting percent-
age this season, which is the best in the SEC and good for 32nd in the coun-
try.
Here is a look at what each of UF’s three seniors have accomplished dur-
ing their time with the Gators.14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, DECEMBER 1, 2014
Florida volleyball honors seniors
Jordan McPherson / Alligator Staff
Taylor Unroe makes a dig against Missouri on Oct. 24 in the O’Connell Center. Unroe is the second 
player in Florida’s history to make 1,500 digs during her college career.
Eden Otero / Alligator Staff
Holly Pole makes a dig against Missouri on Oct. 24. Pole became Florida’s libero this season and is averaging 3.40 digs per set.Taylor Unroe
In her final season, Unroe was removed from the libero position 
and placed as a defensive specialist to give Florida more versatility. 
The result: The second player in the history of Florida volleyball to 
record 1,500 digs during her career. One year after being named the 
SEC Libero of the Year, Unroe is second on the Gators’ roster in digs per set (2.02) while playing in all 99 sets . Wise said she was confident in the former libero’s ability to communicate and help run the defense 
behind teammate and now-starting libero Holly Pole.
Holly Pole
What can be said about Pole that hasn’t already been said? 
A walk-on double major in accounting and sport management 
who has managed to become one of Florida’s most pivotal players 
in elevating the Florida offense. Her chemistry with setter Mackenzie 
Dagostino has created offensive monsters in players like Rhamat Al-hassan and Alex Holston, and her ability to lead a defense and take the majority of rotations will be important in the coming NCAA Tour-
nament.
This season alone, Pole has averaged 3.40 digs per set and is second 
on the team with 29 service aces.Maddy 
Monserez
Of the three seniors, Monserez 
is usually the one who flies under 
the radar.
Most of her contributions have 
come off the bench in relief for Pole and Unroe.
But the Orlando native be-
came an integral cog in Florida’s defense during her four years.
Highlights such as a 23-dig 
outing against Tennessee during the 2012 season, digging a ball 
over press row during a match 
and setting up service runs are just a few of Monserez’s best moments during her time with 
Florida.
In her final season with UF, 
Monserez is averaging 1.89 digs 
per set and set a career-high with 15 service aces while assuming 
the role as Florida’s main backup 
defensive specialist. She’s second on the Gators’ roster in recep-tion attempts (496), and her .986 
reception percentage this season 
is the highest among Florida’s backline players.

with an average ﬁ  eld positioning of 
the UF 45 is abysmal. 
The self inﬂ  icted wounds didn’t 
help things much either, with 105 yards of penalties incurred, includ-ing 25 on one play which backed UF out of ﬁ  eld goal range.
Florida’s rushing attack never 
really got going. Harris led the team with 41 yards. Kelvin Taylor and Matt Jones combined for 66 yards on 22 touches. In the pass-
ing game, Harris was also unable to 
produce much of anything with er-
rant throws and two interceptions. He ﬁ  nished 13 of 32 through the air with 169 yards in a disappointing 
performance.
As usual, Florida couldn’t pick 
up the slack of a defense that played 
about as well as could be expected, only giving up 17 points to Florida State’s offense as well as a season-low 306 yards of total offense.
This is what these teams are. 
One the standard-bearer of college football excellence over the past two seasons; the other a case study in how many different ways one of 
the titans of the sport can go in the 
wrong direction.
In 2012, Florida left Doak happy, 
with hope that it was only a USC 
victory later that evening away 
from a potential national champi-
onship game bid. The Seminoles, on 
the other hand, had beaten them-selves, falling ﬂ  at in a big game. From that night on, the programs 
have hurtled in opposite directions 
at Mach speed.
Two years later, things are dif-
ferent. Florida State pulled through and Florida didn’t, but then again, 
what did you expect?
Miss-Mississippi State in the Egg 
Bowl. 
Ole Miss came into the Egg 
Bowl limping with three losses, a banged-up quarterback in Bo 
Wallace and still without its best 
receiver, Laquon Treadwell. But it 
managed to upset the Mississippi 
State Bulldogs, who came in sitting at No. 4 in the country and still vy-
ing for a spot in the College Foot-
ball Playoff. 
Wallace had 296 yards in the air 
on just 13 throws, and the Rebels’ run game had one of its most suc-
cessful games on the year. Jaylen 
Walton had a 91-yard touchdown 
run late in the third quarter to put the Rebels up two touchdowns. 
He would ﬁ  nish with 148 yards. Running back Jordan Wilkins took a pitch from Wallace and threw a touchdown to Cody Core to go up 34-17 with just over nine minutes left in the game. 
Alabama avenged last year’s 
“kick six” last second loss to the Tigers and won 55-44 in Bryant-Denny while putting a couple of records in the books in the process. 
The Crimson Tide’s 99 combined 
points were the most scored in Iron 
Bowl history. The Tide’s explosive wideout Amari Cooper tied his school record of 224 yards, which 
he ﬁ  rst acquired against Tennessee 
last month.  
With the victory, the Crimson 
Tide secured a trip to Atlanta, Ga. for the SEC Championship Game 
against Missouri next Saturday. 
Playoff bids on the line next 
week: No. 7 Baylor and No. 3 Or-egon could earn their spots in the playoff with wins on Saturday. Oregon, who beat in-state rival 
Oregon State 47-19 last week, will 
face Arizona in the Pac-12 Cham-
pionship. A loss for the Ducks will likely take them out of the playoff picture.
Baylor’s ﬁ  nal game of the sea-
son comes against No. 12 Kansas State. With a win over the Wildcats the Bears will win the Big 12 Title outright. Although No. 4 TCU is 
ranked ahead of Baylor as of right 
now, Baylor winning the confer-
ence would likely put them into the Top 4. 
Men’s Basketball: The 18th-ranked men’s basketball 
team entered the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament on Para-
dise Islands, Bahamas, with conﬁ  dence but left with 
doubt. The Gators dropped two of their three games to 
ﬁ  nish the tournament in sixth place out of eight teams. 
In all three contests — a 66-65 overtime loss to George-
town, a 56-47 win against Alabama-Birmingham and a 
75-64 loss to No. 4 UNC — Florida failed to shoot above 
36 percent from the ﬁ  eld.
Football: After keeping it close all game, Florida could 
not stop Jameis Winston and No. 3 Florida State, losing 
the game 24-19. In Will Muschamp’s ﬁ  nal game as UF’s 
head coach, Florida failed to capitalize on turnovers and 
good ﬁ  eld position.
Soccer: The Gators’ run in the NCAA Tournament ended 
in the Elite Eight on Friday. No. 2 regional seed Florida 
fell to No. 1 regional seed Stanford after being defeated 
4-3 in penalty kicks.
Volleyball: No. 6 Florida won its ﬁ  nal two matches of 
the season — a 3-0 sweep against South Carolina on 
Wednesday and a 3-2 upset at No. 3 Texas on Saturday 
— to ﬁ  nish the regular season with 20 straight victories. 
Sophomore right-side hitter Alex Holston (41 kills, .436 
hitting percentage) led the Gators offensively, while 
setter Mackenzie Dagostino tallied 103 assists in eight 
sets (12.88/set average).
Women’s Basketball: UF went 2-0 this week, defeat-
ing Charleston Southern 92-64 on Tuesday and topping 
Georgetown 81-73 on Friday. The Gators had four play-
ers score more than 20 total points in the two games, 
with redshirt junior guard Cassie Peoples leading the 
way with 34 points on 10-of-19 shooting. Guard Carlie 
Needles led Florida with 22 rebounds on the week, 
while freshmen Brooke Copeland, Haley Lorenzen and 
Dyandria Anderson combined for 47 points.COLUMN , from page 13Florida State won despite

WEEKEND ROUNDUP

and painful story that reveals the 
true cruelty of the real world not found in Hollywood’s scripted creations.
A day after publicly losing his 
job in front of a nationally tele-vised audience, Muschamp was still under contract to report to work to ﬁ  lm his weekly show with Mick Hubert. Sometimes life doesn’t give you a romantic ride into the sunset. Sometimes it gives you a ﬁ  ve-point loss and a chore on your ﬁ  rst day of unem-
ployment.
“When you get ﬁ  red,” Mus-
champ joked, “I’m not a very good negotiator.”
But with the long, drawn-out 
departure of Muschamp now in 
the past, only the players are left to cling onto the bitter memories left behind from this coaching re-gime.
And yet, no more than 30 min-
utes after suffering their latest de-feat, the Gators universally stuck by their embattled coach. For Max Garcia, Muschamp didn’t hang his hat on the number of wins he earned but instead on the integ-rity of the program.
Maybe it cost Muschamp his 
job, but he never lost the respect from his players.
“He was a man that always addressed our character before and after losses,” Garcia said. “He wasn’t saying, ‘Yeah forget the people who don’t believe in us.’ He was never like that … So that’s going about it the right way. Knowing you, knowing your family, that’s doing it the right way.”
Even down to his ﬁ  nal game, 
Muschamp focused on keep-ing his players in line and out of trouble.
When Gerald Willis shoved 
Jameis Winston on the sideline during Saturday’s matchup, Mus-champ wasted no time in send-ing the ﬁ  ery defensive lineman to the locker room for the rest of the game.
Afterward, Muschamp said 
he would have dismissed Willis from the team if he was still in charge — a punishment interim head coach D.J. Durkin may keep within reach when preparing for the team’s bowl game.
And when Tevin Westbrook 
dropped yet another key pass for the Gators, Muschamp showed his trademark passion despite knowing the battle he was in was over.
Even if he had won the game, 
the war was still lost. He would still be looking for a job the next day.
However, he never strayed too far from the coach Florida fans have grown to love and hate dur-ing these four years. But when Muschamp met his players in the locker room after the game, they did see a side to their coach that they had previously never seen.
“You know, just ﬁ  rst time we 
actually saw him emotional about the situation because he was coaching his last game,” redshirt senior Mike Taylor said. “I loved him as a coach and a player. I loved him as a coach and a per-son even more. Just told us that he loved us and he appreciated everything we did for him as we appreciate him more than he can even realize.”
Players still rallied around Muschamp following FSU loss

3 KEY PLAYS
 SWAMP STUDS
With Florida State already ahead 14-9 
in the second quarter, Jameis Winston 
led the Seminoles on an eight-play,

to give the Seminoles a 12-point lead 
the Gators couldn’t overcome.
KEY STAT: 105

TURNING POINT
After Florida intercepted Jameis Winston for the 
third time, UF set up shop on the FSU 9. But 
Treon Harris’ pass to Tevin Westbrook fell out of 
Westbrook’s hands and into the arms of FSU’s Ter-
rance Smith, who returned it for a touchdown. FSU 
scored 14 unanswered points following that play.
Austin Hardin carried the Ga-
tors on Saturday. The redshirt 
sophomore kicker connected 
on his ﬁ  rst four ﬁ  eld goal 
attempts and made Florida’s 
only extra-point attempt to give 
UF 13 of its 19 points on Saturday. 
With Florida trailing 21-9 with less than 
a minute remaining in the ﬁ  rst half, Clay 
Burton put the game back in reach. 
The senior tight end caught a 15-yard 
pass from Treon Harris in the left corner 
of the endzone to bring the score to 
21-16.
Brian Poole knew where he 
needed to be on Saturday. 
The junior defensive back 
recorded two interceptions 
against the Seminoles to 
bring his season total up to 
three. Poole also recorded four solo tackles in the 
loss.
With the Gators facing fourth and 
10 from midﬁ  eld with 1:47 left on the 
clock, Treon Harris needed to make a 
play. Instead, the true freshman threw 
his seventh straight incompletion to 
end any hope Florida had of pulling out 
an upset.
Dante Fowler put up 
another solid performance 
on Saturday despite facing 
constant double-teaming. 
The junior recorded four 
solo tackles and recorded 
the only sack of the game.
