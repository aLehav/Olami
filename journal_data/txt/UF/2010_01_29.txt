Board of Governors
considers bar rules
0 THE RULES WOULD LIMIT
DRINK SPECIALS.
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
The Florida Board of Governors
is considering a sobering proposal
that would regulate drink specials
at bars.
The board met in Tampa at
the University of South Florida
Wednesday and Thursday.
It addressed the idea of legisla-
tion that would give Florida coun-
ties the power to regulate gender-
specific drink specials, such as
ladies nights or specials offering
alcohol for lower than wholesale
costs.
Board member Ann Duncannoted the controversial nature of
the proposal for many university
students across the state and said
it is meant to stimulate conversa-
tion.
"It is a complicated issue,"
Duncan said. "It is not one-size-
fits-all."
She said the board wants to
explore more opinions from stu-
dents and businesses it might af-
fect before bringing anything to
the Florida Legislature.
Bill Edmonds, the spokesman
for the Florida Board of Gover-
nors, explained the board's desire
to start a conversation with those
who have a stake in the matter.
"They want to talk to retail as-
sociations and restaurant associa-
tions and get their points of view

Eight stages of entertainment and 160 arti-
sans will take Gainesville back in time starting
this weekend at the 24th annual Hoggetowne
Medieval Faire, organized by the City of
Gainesville Division of Cultural Affairs.
Linda Piper, the events coordinator for the
festival, said the fair is one of the most well-
known in the country with more than 50,000
people traveling from as far away as Louisi-
ana.
"I've been producing the Faire for 15 years
and have watched it grow bigger and better
each year," Piper said.
The event will feature music and magi-
cians from aerial acts to acrobatics.
In medieval fashion, there will be jousting
and human-powered rides, she said."I think this is a great way to escape the
hustle and bustle we all live and experience
a really fun time where things are simpler
and easier," Piper said. "It's just a fantasy
world."
"I think this is a great way to escape

on Saturday, Sunday and on Feb. 6 and 7. It

By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Students interested in Student Government
should go Reitz Union Room 284 Friday, Mon-
day or Tuesday between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
Members of the Unite Party and the Stu-
dent Alliance party will be conducting inter-
views and selecting new members to join their
ranks.
Students should bring Gator 1 IDs and re-
sumes.
Senate President Ashton Charles, the Unite
Party candidate for Student Body president,
said 50 Senate seats need to be filled.
In the spring, senators are elected to rep-
resent their years and majors, she said, as op-
posed to the fall, when senators are elected
based on where they live.
Charles said the Unite Party will be look-ing for students who want to play an active
role on campus.
"We really want those passionate people
who want to get involved and make a differ-
ence," Charles said.
"We're looking for every Gator that
really wants to make an impact on
our university."
Ben Cavataro

Ben Cavataro, Student Alliance candidate
for Student Body president, said the party is
looking for members from all classes, majors
and interests.
"We're looking for every Gator that really

By MEGAN MCGARRELL
Alligator Contributing Writer
"Oedipus the King," a more than
2,500-year-old play, will begin a nine-
show run at the Nadine McGuire
Black Box Theatre today.
"This show reintroduces people
to a classic," said C.J. Roell, co-stage
manager. "They know it, but it is
different to actually come and expe-
rience it. It is old yet still powerful
today."
This version of the play is not iden-
tical to those done in the past, though,
said Yanci Bukovec, the director of
the play. Instead, he decided to reveal
the ending of the story right away."I am using a contemporary ap-
proach by showing the ending first.
It's more accessible to modern audi-
ences," he said. "But I leave them
questioning how it happened and
how the story will unfold."
Bukovec said he feels
On this is an important pro-
Campus duction to put on and
for people to see.
"['Oedipus'] is a classic. All of
the classics are the building blocks
of what we are today," he said. "This
production is the root of theater. It is
how theater began."
Tickets cost $13 for students
through the University Box Office,
located at the end of the Reitz Union
Colonnade.

Cyclists promote solar power during campus pit stop
By JENNIFER COLEMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
After pedaling 12,993 miles, two cyclists
made a pit stop in Gainesville Thursday as
part of a worldwide bicycle tour to promote
solar energy.
About 50 people attended the cyclists'
presentation that highlighted their journey
and the benefits of solar power in Smathers
Library East. The presentation was part of
UF's SolarCycle Week, a campaign revolv-ing around the cyclists' visit.
Cyclists Susie Wheeldon, Jamie Vining
and lain Henderson left from London City
Hall last May and have been raising money
for SolarAid, a poverty and climate change
charity in the U.K.
They have also created a blog, The Solar-
Cycle Diaries.
Henderson was unable to attend the pre-
sentation.
Wheeldon showed the crowd the solar
panels on her bicycle. The panels power theteam's cell phones and tracking devices.
She said the inspiration behind the jour-
ney stemmed from a Gloria Steinem quote:
"We can tell our values by looking at our
checkbook stubs."
"I looked at my checkbook stubs and
realized that, although I was a wonderful
person and very charitable and very giving,
I would spend a very long time in the pub;
and maybe I should try to spend more time
thinking about how I can live better and
more sustainably," Wheeldon said.The team traveled an average of 82.75
miles per day, Wheeldon said.
After the presentation, audience mem-
bers asked what the cyclists found along
the road.
Vining said he found a cowboy hat in
Texas.
"It perfectly molds to my head, and I've
kept it as a souvenir ever since," Vining
said.
Wheeldon and Vining will be leaving
Gainesville for Miami on Saturday.
Idea developed last November
WALK, from page 1
students another opportunity to hear
the walkers' stories.
The idea for the walk was born
in November 2009 after the group
had protested together for about two
years.
Matos said they felt that the ral-
lies weren't doing enough to solve the
problems undocumented immigrants
face in the United States.
"We had to do something bigger,"
he said. "Something that would re-
quire sacrifice."
The walkers are often joined by
community members who want to
show their support.
Matos said they have seen crowds
of nearly 100 people follow them.
"It's so amazing to see that we have
become a beacon of hope for these peo-
ple that are silenced," he said.
Bianca Gras, president of CHISPAS,and Matos both encouraged students
and residents to come out and sup-
port the walkers during their time in
Gainesville.
"Trail of Dreams is an amazing sto-
ry and an amazing cause," Gras said.
"We've been fighting for this since we
started."
"We had to do something
bigger. Something that would
require sacrifice."
Felipe Matos
protestor
Matos shared Gras' sentiments.
"The most important part of our
campaign is the people who stay in the
communities," Matos said. "They are
the ones who truly affect the change."
For more information about Trail
of DREAMs or to donate directly to
the cause, visit the team's Web site at

Miami residents Gaby Pacheco, Felipe Matos, Andrea Ortiz and Carlos Rao speak to students
and faculty about their 28-day journey from Gainesville on the Trail of DREAMs Thursday.
Board of Governors wants student, business owner opinions on matter
REGULATIONS, from page 1
on this," he said.
John Barnes, the University of North
Florida Student Body President and chair
of the Florida Student Association, said the
board's decision to move slowly in its nego-
tiations could help make the proposal suc-cessful.
Barnes said it was important to include
students in the talks.
Nick Hicks, the manager and bartender
of Jack's Bar and Grill, said negotiating with
the government about regulating private
business can be tricky.
Hicks said he would be OK with regu-
lations if the Florida Board of Governorsreaches out to all bar owners and works out
a proposal everyone can agree upon.
He said he understands the
State board hopes to protect stu-
News dents' safety.
"There's going to be a lot of
give and take on both sides," Hicks said.
Edmonds said student groups should
also be involved in the discussion.UF journalism senior Morgan Lamborn
said it's nice to have inexpensive nights out,
but sometimes people can go overboard.
She said different regulations in different
counties may tempt students to cross coun-
ty lines to find better drink specials.
"I wouldn't want to see one county de-
cide it's more conservative than another,"
Lamborn said. "That could be dangerous."

NATIONAL
Students, professor comment on State of the Union
By MATT HARRINGER
Alligator Writer
After a difficult year and the end
of a turbulent decade, President
Barack Obama's State of the Union
address evoked opinions from both
sides of the political spectrum.
The president's speech Wednes-
day night addressed all of the major
issues being debated in Congress:
health care, energy independence,
education and the economy.
Political science professor Rich-
ard Conley said Obamna was ac-knowledging what people have
been telling him for the past year:
It's time to focus on the job market.
UF College Republicans Chair-
man Johnathan Lott agreed.
"It's time for the president to talk
about jobs, but I'm not sure he's go-
ing to do the right thing."
Conley said the president is be-
ginning to react to polls that show
the public is concerned about the
nation's budget deficits and foreign
debt.
And while the president urged
bipartisanship, Conley was skepti-cal.
"There's not a whole lot of basis
to think bipartisanship will return
with a flare," he
said.
But Ben Cava-
-taro, president of
the UF College
ISU Democrats, was
optimistic about
Obama's agenda
Obama for 2010.
He watched
the State of the Union with more
than 30 other college Democrats atGator's Dockside restaurant. Like
the Democrats in Congress watch-
ing the speech in the House Cham-
ber, he said they were applauding,
laughing and cheering as the presi-
dent spoke.
"It's one of the most exciting po-
litical events of the year," he said.
Cavataro said Americans like the
new focus on jobs and that he was
excited about what the president of-
fered for college students.
Obama said he wanted to in-
crease Pell Grants, implement stu-
dent loan forgiveness for thoseworking in public service and end
federal tax subsidies for banks giv-
ing student loans.
Cavataro said the tax subsidies
are a waste of taxpayer money, and
the government should loan directly
to students instead.
And while Republicans and
Democrats remain divided on the
future of the country, Obama urged
Congress to embrace unity.
"Let's seize this moment,"
Obama said, " to start anew, to carry
the dream forward and to strength-
en our union once more.

The Editorial Board has never been so happy to say
TGIF. And we are in dire need of the weekend to rest and
recuperate because it's almost that time again, kids. It's
the most dreaded time of the semester. Yep, you guessed
it -Student Government elections.
So without further ado, we're going to present you with

You know the fliers will find their way into your hands
regardless because the people passing them out are ruth-

Charlie Simpson is a different sort of ruthless -the
good kind. The 7-year-old boy from the United Kingdom
raised about $400,000 for Haiti's earthquake victims when
he rode his bicycle about 5 miles around the local park.
And that's why we're going to toss the clever little chap
a you're-brillant-and-made-all-of-us-over-here-across-the-

Wicked!
Simpson isn't the only one who made a lasting contri-
bution.
J.D. Salinger, author of "The Catcher in the Rye," died

And so, for introducing Holden Caulfield to us and pro-
ducing endless conversations about the ducks in the pond
in high school English classes everywhere, we're going to
place a wreath of even-Holden-couldn't-call-you-a-phony

Haitians that money could have fed or how many books
for a children's library it could have bought.
As for CBS, the network is seeping with hypocrisy.
They rejected a church's ad a few Super Bowls ago be-
cause it included the message that the LGBT community
was welcome.
Now a gay dating site is challenging CBS, requesting
a spot for a commercial that features two men holding
hands then kissing. We hope CBS does the right thing and
airs that message, too.
Speaking of discrimination, the Editorial Board would
like to lob a we-suspect-you-may-be-a-descendant-of-Sa-
tan DART at the Ohio teacher who humiliated an 11-year-
old boy in front of his classmates for having long hair.
The kid's mom is suing, and we're all for it. If she
doesn't spend it all on therapy, she should buy him a car
and pay for his college.
On a lighter note, we have a situation of simple stupid-
ity. The Editorial Board would like to paint a picture of a
DART and hang it on the front door of the residence of the
art student who tripped and ripped a hole in a $130-mil-
lion Picasso painting.
Walk much? Seriously, we've all been to museums, and
it's not like paintings are just hanging out in the middle of
the room for any idiot cursed by gravity to stumble over.
That's all for this week. In the meantime, try not to
trip.

Politicians support parties, not voters
As long as I can remember, we have had terrible po-litical divisions in our country. The only time Demo-
crats and Republicans seem able to work together are
in times of crisis, like after the attacks of Sept. 11 or Pearl Har-
bor. The politics of our country, specifically of Congress, are
inherently wrong and against what Americans want.
Senators and representatives aren't actually voting based
on what their constituents want, unless they are up for re-
election (see Sens. Ben Nelson and Blanche Lincoln). In fact, I
would argue most aren't actually voting based on what they
want or believe is best for the country.
Now, I'm going to focus more on the Republicans, simply
because in my brief history with politics I have experienced
this phenomenon with Republicans more than Democrats.
Sadly, the people in Congress have become puppets of
their superiors, voting on what the current party line is. That
party line could be something like not working with Demo-
crats on anything they propose, even if it's a bill like Sen. Al
Franken's that closed a loophole that prevented a woman
who was raped by employees of Halliburton while in Iraq
to sue. The Republicans, instead of voting on the issue based
on what they actually believe -which I'm assuming is that
rape is wrong -chose to vote with the party line of blocking
every Democratic bill, no matter what.
I'm reminded of the Franken bill by the recent election of
Scott Brown in Massachusetts, who supported a bill in Mas-
sachusetts that forced every citizen of the state to purchase
health care. The bill was very similar to the controversial bill
currently being debated in Congress -the bill that Brown
ran his campaign on. This time, however, Brown ran his
campaign based on being the 41st Republican in the Senate
to filibuster the health care bill, one that he supported in his
own state. Apparently, it was good enough for his own state,
but it's devastating for the entire country.
I suspect Brown actually supports the health care bill, as I
suspect many Republicans are in favor of health care reform.
I also suspect there are many Democrats who don't supportthe bill or wouldn't vote for it if they
didn't have to vote along their party
lines.Remember the health care bill
that the U.S. House of Representa-
tives passed? It had, surprisingly, one
Republican vote supporting it: Rep.
Paul Murty Joseph Cao. Within hours of voting
letters@alligator org for it, Cao had fundraisers canceled.
He was being punished for voting for
something he believed in, and because
of that, he said, he won't vote for the merger bill.
This isn't the way to conduct good business. We need to
promote democratic values by promoting free thinking in
our Congressmen and Congresswomen. As a country, we
don't get anywhere when we constantly bicker and put the
values of a few in front of the needs of millions.
That is why I believe a drastic change is needed in Con-
gress, to either a three- or zero-party system. If there was a
truly independentpartywithpower, its members of Congress
could vote with their hearts and stay in the middle, where
most Americans are. Similarly, if there were no political par-
ties, there would be no allegiances. As President Obama said
in his State of the Union address to Congress, "We were sent
here to serve our citizens, not our ambitions."
If, as President Obama declared Wednesday, the health
care bill will reduce the deficit over the next 20 years, then
members of Congress have a fiscal responsibility to pass the
bill. I know this is a simplistic take on the situation, but some-
times politics can be simple. We have a tremendous deficit.
If we can help millions of people in the country in the short
term while saving money in the long term, we have a respon-
sibility to do it -regardless of whether it's a health care bill
or an anti-rape amendment to a government contract, and
regardless of which political parties propose the idea.

U U U
SG president does not appear to care
about graduate students
On Wednesday, I went to Student
Body President Jordan Johnson's town
hall forum concerning the new fee for
the Reitz Union expansion and repairs.
The forum made clear that Johnson is
all about appearances and does not care
about substance. Despite the repeated
explanations I and others gave him that
graduate students are already financially
stretched thin and do not use the Reitz
Union enough to justify paying the fee,
he continued to evade the issue and use
George W. Bush-like circular logic. Such
an approach was not only insulting, but
it betrayed the fact that, at the end of
the day, Student Government is for and
by the undergraduate population, and
among them, the Greeks.
This is not a battle between graduate
and undergraduate students. It's the fact
that graduate students' concerns about
essentially paying a tax to subsidize the
undergraduate "student experience" are
not being heard.
The Reitz Union cannot offer graduate
students anything that our own depart-
ments do not give us, but Johnson, once
again, does not care. He stated over and
over again that the fee issue is up for ref-
erendum later this semester, but a simple
vote cannot show how a significant demo-
graphic of the UF campus feels. The bal-
lot doesn't ask us to state whether we are
graduate or undergraduate, and under-
graduate voters will almost certainly out-
number graduate voters. If Johnson actu-
ally cares, he should survey all graduate
students about their use of the Union and
if they're willing to pay the fee instead of
pretending to feel our pain.

Freshman guard Kenny Boynton and Florida will travel
to Knoxville to play Tennessee on Sunday.UF hits stride with
SEC up for grabs
0 THE GATORS FACE THE
VOLS ON SUNDAY.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
Thanks to their recent suc-
cess and a well-timed upset,
the Gators are right back in the
thick of things.
Entering Sunday's 1 p.m.
matchup at No. 14 Tennessee
(15-4, 3-2 Southeastern Con-
ference), Florida is on a four-
game winning streak and play-
ing some of its best basketball
of the season.
That, combined with South
Carolina's 68-62 upset of No.
1 Kentucky on Tuesday, has
given the Gators (15-5, 4-2
SEC) hope that they aren't out
of the SEC race despite drop-
ping their first two conference
games.
"The SEC is up for grabs
with Kentucky losing (Tues-
day) night," freshman guard
Kenny Boynton said. "We've
just got to keep getting wins,
and I think our next gamewill probably be our biggest
game.
With a win against the
Volunteers in Knoxville, the
Gators might have a chance to
jump back into the top 25 and
establish themselves as one of
the top teams in a league that
has only one team without a
conference loss, Vanderbilt
(5-0 in SEC play), and six of 12
teams with two or three con-
ference losses.
"There's 10 more league
games left," junior power for-
ward Alex Tyus said. "Any-
thing can happen, and if we do
what we're supposed to do, we
can be right there at the top."
Tennessee has dealt with
adversity following the dis-
missal of forward Tyler Smith
and dropped its last two
games -78-63 at Georgia and
85-76 against Vanderbilt -but
the Volunteers have proven
they have potential to pull off
an upset, toppling then-No. 1
Kansas 76-68 on Jan. 10.
"That would be huge,"

Well-rested Florida heads to face Ole Miss
Gators coming off bye week
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@alligator org
While Bianca Thomas, the Southeast-
ern Conference's leading scorer, and Ole
Miss (14-6, 5-2 SEC) spent part of this
week prepping for their matchup with
South Carolina on Thursday night, the
Gators rested on their bye week.
With the week off, coach Amanda
Butler said the coaching staff tried to
look at all the things the team could do
to get better, including turnovers, which
will be an area the Gators hope to im-
prove on when they face the Rebels on
Sunday in Oxford.
Florida (11-9, 4-3 SEC) had 12 turn-
overs in the first half compared to four
in the second half in a 59-56 win against
the Gamecocks on Jan. 24.
The Gators fixed their turnover prob-
lems in that game, but they couldn'tturn the tide against Alabama, when 24
turnovers, 31 percent shooting and a 22
percent night from beyond the arc led to
an 82-58 loss on Jan. 21.
"It makes us feel bad and sick to
watch the film and look how we played
in that game and
how we played in the
South Carolina game,"
senior guard Lon-
Women's nika Thompson said.
Basketball "It's a totally different
team."
The Gators will
need to play like they did against some
of the better competition this season:
a 66-64 loss to then-No. 4 Tennessee, a
nine-point loss to then-No. 8 Georgia,
and their 55-52 win against Mississippi
State
"I like what we've done so far -had
a tough one against Alabama -but
besides that, we've competed or wonin every ballgame that we've been in,"
Butler said. "The ones we didn't win,
we were in position to win."
UF hopes the week off allows it to
come out and emulate its play against
previous tough opponents, as Ole Miss
will fall into that category.
The Rebels won four-straight games
before losing to the Gamecocks 64-50
on Thursday, including wins over the
Bulldogs in Athens and No. 18 LSU, and
are tied at the top of the SEC with the
Volunteers.
"We've gotta put one of our best per-
formances together because, aside from
their personnel and what they can do to
you individually, they're just playing
with tremendous confidence," Butler
said. "And that's evident."
The Rebels' offense is carried by its
guards, with three averaging double
figures.
The head of the Rebels' trio is
Thomas, who entered Thursday with a

Tough slate
continues
against LSU
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
UF coach Rhonda Faehn has said sev-
eral times the team's goal is to get better
as the season progresses and prepare itself
for the postseason, and according to her,
her young squad is right on schedule.
Coming off two consecutive victories
against Southeastern Conference oppo-
nents, No. 4 Florida (2-1, 2-0 SEC) will play
host to No. 13 LSU (3-2, 1-1 SEC) on Friday
at 7 p.m. in the O'Connell Center for the
fourth annual Gators Link to Pink meet.
The meet marks the fourth-straight top-
15 team the Gators have faced to start this
season, having already gone up against
then-No. 9 Oklahoma, then-No. 7 Arkan-
sas and then-No. 12 Kentucky.
Faehn tries to give her team a tough
schedule every season, as she said it will
help the squad prepare mentally for the
tough challenges it will face in the post-
season.
"It makes the team perform under pres-
sure because it's a really strong, quality
team," Faehn said. "We get to see early on
who can handle the pressure, so we know
when it comes to SEC Championships
or NCAAs and there are 10,000 people
watching."
The test of seeing who can handle the
pressure is sure to continue against the Ti-
gers.
Three of the Gators' four meets against
LSU last season were decided by less than
half a point each, with the narrowest mar-
gin (.075) coming during NCAA Team
Qualifying.
LSU also boasts the top-ranked all-
around gymnast in the nation, Susan
Jackson (39.475), while Florida's Ashan~e
Dickerson (39.358) is tied for fourth but is
the highest-ranked freshman.
Facing a ranked team and an elite gym-
nast such as Jackson could be a good test
to see how Dickerson and the rest of the
team perform under the pressure that
Faehn spoke about.

ing Walker said. "Tennessee's a highly
ranked team. They're a good team with
or without Tyler Smith, so we've got to
just be ready going in."
Over the last four games, UF has
shown signs that it might be kicking
into mid-season form: effective full-
court defense and high-percentage
shooting against Georgia, mature late-
game play against South Carolina and
Arkansas, balanced scoring against LSU
and improved rebounding throughout
all four wins.
"We're confident right now," Walker
said. "We're playing really well, and it'sall starting in practice. We can't get big-
headed."
The Gators played one of their most
complete games of the season Wednes-
day night, with Walker, Boynton and
Tyus scoring more than 20 points
apiece.

three, who were denied the ball as part of the Gators' de-
fensive scheme, shot a collective 24 percent from the field

Sportsmanlike Conduct
By ALLISON BANKO
Alligator Writer
The minute UF athletes slip on their or-
ange-and-blue jerseys, they are shoved into
the spotlight.
Thousands of spectators from Gainesville
come to root for them in their quest of chomp-
ing out the day's opponent. But the effect UF
athletes have on the community doesn't stop
when they peel off their jerseys and step out of
the locker room.
Underneath their uniforms are hearts of
gold.
While it's well-known that the football team
throws as much to the community as it does
touchdowns, there are athletes throughout
The Gator Nation who roll up their sleeves.
For one example, move down the road past
the long shadow cast by The Swamp to Katie
Seashole Pressly Softball Stadium.
Senior softball player Francesca Enea has
been making her mark by transforming her
glove hand into a helping hand.
In 2009, along with the help of others, Enea
founded Swinging for Cancer, a fundraising
event run by the softball program to benefit
the Shands Cancer Research Hospital.
It is centered on coaches and players of the
UF athletic community who attempt to hit off
of the team's ace pitcher. Afterward, fans are
encouraged to fill out donation slips.
In 2009, Stacey Nelson threw heat and gave
the star-studded batting order -including
basketball coach Billy Donovan and baseball
coach Kevin O'Sullivan -a run for its mon-
ey.
"Seeing the student-athletes and their
coaches trying to hit off of Stacey was hilari-
ous," Enea said. "It was wonderful to have
fun in the process of raising about $400 for
Shands."
This year's event, held Saturday, will ben-
efit Friends of Jaclyn, a program that pairs ath-
letes with children who have brain tumors.
In Enea's initiative to get involved with the
Friends of Jadyn program, the team gained
13-year-old Heather Braswell, who had been
diagnosed with a medulloblastoma -a ma-
lignant brain tumor. Since Heather's pairing
with the Gators in the fall, she and the Gators
have played softball games, celebrated Heath-
er's birthday in the locker room and just hung
out together.
"Francesca and the girls are always texting
Heather," Terri said. "It's indescribable how
they have put a spring in Heather's step."
This Saturday, the Braswell family will
make the 90-minute drive from Apopka to the
Swinging for Cancer event.
The Braswells' car will be easy to spot -
the one in the parking lot showered in FSU
stickers.
"My husband and I both went to Florida
State and are die-hard 'Nole fans," Terri said.p
-. -., " -"-y
Florida junior Francesca Enea checks the lineup sheet during the UF softball team's
Swinging for Cancer event on Sunday, Feb. 1, 2009.
"I remember being on the phone with the
Friends of Jaclyn and finding out that Heath-
er's match was the Gators softball team. I told
them I would go out and buy some blue and
orange.",
Heather has gotten her share of UF gear
over the months, including a softball jersey
and an orange-and-blue Gators blanket, given
to her as a birthday gift from the team.
"Heather was treated for her disease in
Memphis," Terri said. "Though Heather is
currently cancer-free, we have to go up there
every couple of months. That blanket is in
our luggage every time we make the trip. The
Gators are definitely represented in Tennes-
see."
Saturday will also be the first time Heath-
er and her family will meet members of the
Friends of Jaclyn organization face-to-face.
Enea's charity work goes much further than
utilizing the sticky clay on the softball field.
She served as co-chair of the Gator Tracks
program, a student-athlete organization that
provides shoes to underprivileged elementary
school students in Gainesville.
With that track record, Enea gets requests
from teammates about how to get involved in
the community.
"It's the small things that count," Enea said.
"I really want to make sure that my team gets
as involved in service as possible. It really is
contagious."
The gymnastics team is continuing thebenevolence in the sports realm, most nota-
bly junior Alicia Goodwin, whose focus has
been toward breast cancer awareness.
Tonight, Goodwin and her teammates will
support the cause during the Link to Pink
Meet against LSU, when both teams will don
pink leotards.
"This really is a special event for us," Good-
win said. "Our fans come out and support us
during our meets, and this is an opportunity
for us to give back to them."
Goodwill Gators
To get involved, many athletes use the
Goodwill Gators Community Outreach Pro-
gram, set up by the University Athletic Asso-
ciation to provide them with various avenues
to reach out to the Gainesville community.
Popular Goodwill Gators events include
Gator Tracks and Climb for Cancer, an event
in which pediatric cancer patients play sports
with UF athletes.
Such service opportunities allow many
Gators to take off their cleats and slip on the
their do-gooder shoes.
Sophomore soccer player Marsha Harper
has participated in more than 10 Goodwill
Gator events, and her service work landed her
a spot on the 2009 SEC Soccer Community Ser-
vice Team.
"Winning this award really opened me and
my teammates' eyes to what a difference we
can make with our free time," Harper said.Reaching Across Borders
Paving her own way in Gainesville -and
America -is UF senior swimmer Gemma
Spofforth, a native of England.
On top of gracing the O'Connell Center
pool with her All-American and Olympian
talent, Spofforth gives back as a phone coun-
selor for the Alachua County Crisis Center.
"We provide support for people in crisis or
in a state of depression," Spofforth said. "We
strive to understand a situation emotionally
and provide support and solutions to people's
crisis situations and problems."
Along with former UF quarterback Tim
Tebow, Spofforth won the 2009 Ben Hill Grif-
fin Award. The award, from Gator Boosters
Inc., honors athletes who are all giving and
soar athletically and academically.
"To be awarded for my efforts out of the
pool alongside my athletic honors is by far
more exciting to me," Spofforth said. "I know
I can swim, but to gain recognition for some-
thing that I have worked hard at and hasn't
come particularly easy to me is fantastic."
Many would find it difficult to set up their
lives in a foreign country, no less seeking ways
to help others in theirs.
"I think that anywhere in the world com-
munity service means the same thing," Spof-
forth said. "America has taught me multiple
lessons, and over the past three-and-a-half
years has become home to me. I love giving
my time to people less fortunate than me be-
cause I understand how lucky I am."
While many athletes grew into their service
work, others were used to lending a hand.
Former volleyball player and recent gradu-
ate Kristina Johnson was raised in Indianapo-
lis, with an eye toward service.
Her father, Ken, is a motivational speaker
and team chaplain for the NFL's Indianapolis
Colts, and her family runs Emerging Eagles, a
program dedicated to serving inner-city kids.
She kept the tradition alive, being named to
the SEC Volleyball Community Service Team
twice during her time at UF.
Her list of service work is almost as long as
the legs that hold her 6-foot-2 frame.
A short excerpt of her participation in-
volves her volunteerism with the Shands Can-
cer Wing, assistance with the intramural pro-
gram at Stephen Foster Elementary and aid in
the Gator Tracks program.
Soon, Johnson will take her dedication to
service global. In March she'll travel to Africa
to do missionary work and teach religion.
Whether it's on a field, in a gym or in the
hospitals, athletes give back to the town that
has supported them in their wins and losses.
It's a safe bet that when Gators athletes
aren't sweating it out at practice or in a game,
they are removing jerseys to represent UF in
more ways than can be captured in any play,
dunk, home run or touchdown.

UF TRACK AND FIELD
Horn set for heptath Ion
By RYAN BUTLER
Alligator Writer
Gray Horn's life revolves around
competing in the decathlon.
The UF track and field athlete will get
to compete in part of one this weekend.
The sophomore and the rest of the
No. 3 men's and No. 9 women's track
and field teams will compete in the Tex-
as A&M Challenge on Friday and Satur-
day.
It will be the second meet of the in-
door season for most of the team, but the
first for the long-distance squads and the
first chance for Horn to compete in the
heptathlon.
"I'm expecting a big performance,"
Horn said. "Sophomore year is usually
a big breakout year."
Horn emerged on the conference
scene with his first-place finish in the de-
cathlon in last year's Southeastern Con-
ference Championship -the first time a
Gator won the event.
The competition-obsessed Horn is ex-
pected to be another big contributor this
season, starting with the Texas A&M
Challenge, as he prepares to defend his
title in the postseason meets.
This weekend's meet features nine of
the nation's elite teams, three each from
the Pacific-10 Conference, Big 12 Confer-
ence and SEC.
Unlike most regular-season meets,
this competition features team scoringby conference, with the schools from
each league combining their team-point
totals to determine the winning confer-
ence.
"Its exciting because it's No. 2 (Or-
egon), No. 3 (UF) and the defending
champs (Texas A&M)," Horn said.
"There's a lot to prove in this meet, and
I'm looking forward to the good compe-
tition."
"We're not sitting together with
the other coaches to plan strat-
egy. I'm focused on the Gators."
Mike Holloway
UF track coach
The Ducks' Ashton Eaton, the defend-
ing national champion in the decathlon,
stands as Horn's biggest rival in the hep-
tathlon.
But UF coach Mike Holloway said
he's more concerned about how his
teams perform than with helping the
SEC win the early-season meet in Col-
lege Station.
"We're not sitting together with the
other coaches to plan strategy," Hollo-
way said. "I'm focused on the Gators."
Florida will team up with Arkansas
and South Carolina, the Pac-10 will fea-
ture Oregon, Stanford and Washington
State, and Texas, Baylor and the host
Aggies will represent the Big 12 in the
meet.UF travels to Tennessee
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
As the Florida men's and women's
swimming and diving teams take on
Tennessee in their last dual meet of
the regular season, two undefeated
streaks will be on the line.
Starting tonight in Knoxville, the
women's team (9-2, 3-1 SEC) will try
to stay unbeaten against Tennessee.
As of now, the Gators women are 23-0
against the Volunteers.
"It's motivation," sophomore Te-
resa Crippen said. "We always try to
race and touch the wall first."
Crippen and junior men's swim-
mer Conor Dwyer are coming off
stellar performances against Auburn
that earned them CollegeSwimming.
com's Counsilman Hunsaker Division
I National Collegiate Swimmer of the
Week honors.
When the UF men's team (8-0, 3-0
SEC) competes in its meet Saturday
afternoon, the team will attempt to
finish the regular season with an un-
blemished record.
It would mark the first time the
Gators men's team has completed the
regular season undefeated since the
1987-88 season, when Florida finished
7-0.Standing in the way of the UF men's
squad will be No. 11 Tennessee, which
has an undefeated streak of its own to
maintain.
Since the Vols' men began compet-
ing in the Allan Jones Intercollegiate
Aquatic Center in August 2008, they
have been undefeated at home.
This streak includes a 6-0 dual-meet
record as well as wins in two Tennes-
see Invitational meets.
"We'll get a little taste of the same
thing that Auburn
saw when they came
here. It'll be their
senior week," UFSwimming coach Gregg Troy
said. "They've got
a pretty big senior class on the men's
side, so I expect to see a real enthusi-
astic group.
"I'm sure we'll get their best shot,
and it'll be another great opportunity
to see where we are."
Even with the great performance
last week against Auburn, Troy made
it clear to his swimmers that the Au-
burn meet was done with, and now it's
time for Tennessee.
"You're only as good as your last
performance," Troy said. "Next week,
no one's going to care about the Au-
burn dual meet."
