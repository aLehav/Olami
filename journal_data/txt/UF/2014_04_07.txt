ARLINGTON, Texas — This Gators team 
had all the pieces to win the program’s ﬁ  rst 
national title since 2007. It had the depth, ex-perience, chemistry and talent to make that goal a reality.
But UConn stood in the way of chasing 
that dream.
And thanks to its poorest offensive out-ing of the season, Florida was sent packing from AT&T Stadium one game sooner than 
it desired.
A promising season and a historic 30-game 
winning streak came to a screeching halt Sat-
urday in the NCAA Tournament semiﬁ  nals as the No. 1 seed Gators (36-3) fell 63-53 to 
the No. 7 seed Huskies, who will square off against eighth-seeded Kentucky in tonight’s 
national title game at 9:10. 
After losing again to UConn (31-8), the last 
team to beat them before their historic streak, the Gators were in disbelief.

locker room, a red-eyed Casey Prather held ‘Guys that were really willing to bleed for one another’

Gainesville Police arrested the owner 
of a local towing company Friday after-
noon after he helped cover up a scooter theft committed a year ago at Canopy Apartments.
Ofﬁ  cers arrested 48-year-old Stanley 
Hubert Forron, the owner of Advantage Towing, on charges of grand theft and tampering with evidence, said GPD tow-ing and vehicle-for-hire coordinator Ofﬁ  -cer Jeff McAdams.
In March 2013, Bonnalyn Beth Lachut, 
67, stole two scooters from the parking lot of the apartment complex, located at 4400 
SW 20th Ave., McAdams said. When the 
owners reported the scooters stolen, La-chut reached out to Forron for help.
Forron sent employees to her house to 
pick up the scooters and drive them back to the complex. They then unloaded the scooters and posed them as if they were parked illegally, McAdams said.
After taking pictures of the scooters, 
the employees reloaded them in the truck and took them to the tow yard, where they contacted law enforcement to report they were abandoned.
“In our opinion, this was a deliberate 
attempt to avoid being detected,” McAd-ams said.
Ofﬁ  cers booked Forron into the Ala-
chua County Jail at about 2 p.m. Friday. 
He was released about three hours later 
after meeting a $20,000 bond.Advantage

California indie rock band Best Coast 
will show the East Coast some love with 
a free Gainesville performance Friday.
Known for their beachy, upbeat songs, 
the duo will be performing at 7 p.m. in 
the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom as part 
of Reitz Union Board Entertainment’s ﬁ  rst Big Orange Festival.
RUB president Jessica Watson, a 
22-year-old UF public relations senior, said the band — which will be paid $25,000 — is a perfect ﬁ  t for the festival. 
The event will also feature carnival 
games, art vendors and a performance by 
Jake and Amir from CollegeHumor.
“(Best Coast’s) vibe really ﬁ  ts in well 
with what we’re trying to do — big and 
vibrant,” Watson said.
Wristbands will be distributed to 
students with a Gator 1 Card on Thurs-day from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Reitz Union’s northwest walkway and Friday at 2 p.m. at the Grand Ballroom registra-tion desk. 
Students can pick up two guest wrist-bands per ID at the information desk at 5 p.m. Friday.
Claire Fuller, a 20-year-old UF public 
relations sophomore, said she’s been a Best Coast fan since high school.
“RUB does a good job bringing bands 
that our age group is into,” she said.
RUB Bands Committee co-director 
Abigail Gruspe, a 20-year-old UF nutri-tion junior, said her committee’s been hoping to bring Best Coast for a while.
“They’re super summery and upbeat,” 
she said. “I think it will be a good last 
hurrah before summer.”  Best Coast to give East Coast a chance at UFSEE BASKETBALL, PAGE 16Gators reﬂ  ect on loss, teamwork  News Today

Working to pay for college is impossible at the current 
minimum wage, according to research by a Michigan State 
University Ph.D. student, but a UF visiting professor dis-agrees.
Randal Olson, a third-year computer science Ph.D. stu-
dent, wrote a blog post arguing that college students nation-
wide will not be able to work their way through school at the 
current minimum wage.
However, Colin Knapp, a visiting economics professor at 
UF, disagrees with the notion. He said college students don’t 
usually have to pay for their entire tuition without help.
“I don’t think the norm is to work your way through col-
lege,” he said.
The availability of federal student aid, loans, grants and scholarships has made Olson’s point inapplicable for a ma-
jority of UF students, he said.
UF students were awarded about $550 million in aid, in-
cluding loans, in the 2011-2012 school year, according to the UF Factbook.
In the March post, Olson highlighted the disparity be-
tween the rise in minimum wage and tuition, which he called unfair.
Knapp disagreed and said it would not make sense for 
the minimum wage to rise at the same rate tuition rises.
Susel Ramos, a 19-year-old UF international studies 
sophomore, agreed. She works at Gator Corner Dining Cen-
ter and said she has enough financial aid to cover her tuition 
and most of her necessary expenses.
“Your wages and expenses shouldn’t be super crazy as 
a college student,” Ramos said. “Of course everyone would like some more money, but I don’t think it’s bad the way it is.”
Even though the tuition rate and the minimum wage are 
disproportionate, Knapp said it’s not necessarily a problem.
“If you want an education that’s higher quality than 30 
years ago, you have to pay more than you did then,” he said.Research: Earning way through college

LOS ANGELES — Disney and  
Marvel could be one of the finest 
teams around.
Continuing the success of their su-
perhero franchise, “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” has set a record as the biggest domestic April release 
ever. The Disney sequel debuted with 
$96.2 million, topping the previous re-cord-holder, 2011’s “Fast Five,” which opened with $86.2 million.
“The Winter Soldier,” which stars 
Chris Evans as the shield-wielding superhero and Scarlett Johansson (whose sci-fi film “Under the Skin” also debuted this weekend with $140,000) as Black Widow, command-ed 32 international markets last week-
end.
Expanding to Russia, Australia and 
China in its second week, the Marvel 
comic adaptation, boasting a budget of 
more than $170 million, earned $107.1 
million internationally this weekend, bringing its overall worldwide haul to more than $303 million. 
Also a touchstone for Imax, “The 
Winter Soldier” received $9.6 million of its U.S. haul on 346 screens show-ing the film in the enhanced resolu-tion format. Internationally, it showed 
on 278 Imax screens, bringing in $6.5 
million, $4 million of which was de-livered from China.
“Captain America: The First Avenger,” which had a budget of around $140 million, debuted in July 2011 with $65 million. Overall, it 
earned $371 million worldwide.
Why the shift to an April release 
rather than remaining a summer 
launch?
“We looked at the possibility of 
creating separation from the other summer tentpoles,” said Dave Hollis, head of worldwide theatrical distri-bution for Disney. 
“The Avengers effect,” as Hollis 
calls it, set the stage for the continu-ation of Marvel’s massive box office presence, which includes the “Iron 
Man” and “Thor” franchises. With 
the release of the films’ sequels, both have seen earning jumps of more than  35 percent.‘Captain America’ sets April record

Water resources in Florida are 
similar to a college student’s bank 
account — overdrawn.
This was the message the Flori-
da Springs Institute gave as part of its Give Springs a Break event this weekend at Ginnie Springs in High 
Springs.
“We have overtapped our re-
sources everywhere,” said FSI 
founder Bob Knight, who spoke to the more than 60 college students 
Saturday. 
The FSI hosted Give Springs 
a Break to encourage students to 
get involved in water conserva-
tion efforts in Florida. The students 
camped Friday and Saturday nights, getting to know each other while swimming, hiking and tubing.
UF students have been coming 
to Ginnie Springs for years, said Allison Lewis, president of the UF chapter of American Water Re-sources Association. 
The weekend-long event was 
a chance to expose students to the beauty of the water, said Lewis, a 
24-year-old UF environmental engi-
neering graduate student.
“This is our spring,” she said. 
“When you appreciate it, you’re go-
ing to want to take care of it.”
There are more than 1,000 
natural springs in Florida, most 
of which follow major rivers. The 
Floridan aquifer system lies below 
the ground and spans every area of North Central Florida, pumping water into the springs and into our faucets.
“Our groundwater is no longer 
clean, and it’s no longer abundant,” said institute volunteer Debra Se-gal, adding that the scarcity is due to two main problems: overpump-ing and pollution.
Segal said wastewater treat-
ments, agriculture and cattle op-erations — in addition to individual water overuse — have polluted Flor-ida’s water with nitrate-nitrogen. 
One solution is a restoration 
wetland planned for 2015 that will use natural treatment methods to improve water quality in Alachua Sink and the Floridan Aquifer, Se-
gal said.
Called Paynes Prairie Sheetﬂ  ow 
project, the 125-acre wetland will 
look like a gator head from an aerial view and will include hiking trails 
and lookouts. 
But it’s only a small step, Lewis 
said. The community, especially 
college students, must continue to 
make sustainable change.
“We are the future decision mak-
ers,” she said. “It’s so important for 
us to come together.”4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, APRIL 7, 2014

LONDON — Would you 
like some kitten with your cof-
fee?
Feline company is exactly 
what one of London’s new-est cafes is offering — and stressed-out city-dwellers are lapping it up.
“People do want to have 
pets, and in tiny ﬂ  ats, you can’t,” said cafe owner Lau-ren Pears, who opened Lady Dinah’s Cat Emporium last month in an area east of the city’s ﬁ  nancial district.
“There’s not many places 
in London you can just curl up with a book and chill out with a cat or two on your lap,” she said Friday. “I think that’s what our success is down to.”
Cat cafes ﬁ  rst took off 10 
years ago in Japanese cities, where many people live alone in cramped high-rise apart-ment blocks that don’t allow pets. Making feline friends 
became popular therapy for 
lonely or anxious workers.
“I can see how this would 
be good for someone lacking company,” said customer Sara 
Lewis, as she stroked a cat sit-
ting on her lap. “It’s the best 
idea ever.”
The cozy English tea room, 
named after Alice’s cat in “Al-ice in Wonderland,” charges 
customers 5 pounds ($8.29) for 
two hours of kitty company. 
Coffee and afternoon tea — 
sandwiches, cakes and scones 
— are on the menu at an ad-
ditional cost.
Lady Dinah’s opened March 1 and is fully booked 
until the end of June.
Pears raised more than 
109,000 pounds ($181,000) 
through a crowdfunding cam-
paign to get the cafe up and 
running. Despite more than a 
year of planning permission delays and ﬁ  guring out how 
to maintain health and safety 
standards, she says the hard 
work has been worth it.
The 11 resident kitties were 
donated by people leaving the 
country who could no longer 
look after them. Kitty welfare 
is paramount: The cats get reg-
ular breaks away from people, and staff have been trained by animal behaviorists to care for 
them.
Lisa Vann brought her 
8-year-old daughter, who has learning difﬁ  culties, to Lady 
Dinah’s for a playdate. “She’s 
delighted to be here,” she said.
The animal cafe craze 
shows no signs of slowing, 
with establishments now open 
in London, Vienna and Paris. A dog cafe, House of Hounds, is scheduled to open in Lon-
don later this year.
And American animal-lov-
ers won’t be missing out for 
much longer. Two cat cafes are due to open in the San Francis-
co Bay area by the end of 2014.Feline fans ﬂ  ock to

Elaine Turner will start Friday in her per-
manent position as UF College of Agricultural 
and Life Sciences’ new dean.
Turner, the college’s interim dean since 
January, has been at UF for 18 years and has 
served as associate dean since 2006. Her term as dean will ofﬁ  cially begin on Friday.  
Turner said her focus will be on providing 
faculty with opportunities to improve their 
teaching as well as improving the student learning experience in and out the classroom.
The College of Agricultural and Life Sci-
ences is the third-largest college at UF, and Turner said she plans to keep it that way by continuing a reputation on campus of quality programs, advising and professors. 
Turner said she doesn’t want to lose a close 
connection with students in her new posi-tion. 
She said she plans to discuss various means 
of communication with her students.
“There are some things to explore,” Turner 
said, “and there are a lot of potential ways I can keep those connections going.”James Barringer, a 21-year-old UF agricul-
tural education and communications junior, said Turner is a perfect choice for dean. He said he hopes Turner will bring an increase of professional opportunities. 
“She is a great individual and ﬁ  ts in the 
position well,” Barringer said. “She has great initiatives and is dedicated to the mission of CALS and agriculture.”UF agricultural college announces Elaine Turner as new dean

A near record-breaking number 
of Gators are lacing up their shoes 
for RecSports’ eighth annual Mid-night Fun Run.
As of press time, 1,144 run-
ners have signed up for the 5K. This is close to last year’s 1,200 
participants, said Andy Howard, 
assistant director of marketing and communications for UF Rec-Sports.
He said the goal is to register 
1,500 runners and walkers.The Fun Run, which is the larg-
est 5K held on campus, will begin at 11:59 p.m. on the last day of class, April 23. Participants will 
have the option to run a 5K, which 
is about 3.1 miles, or walk 1 mile around Lake Alice.
Registration opened Tuesday 
at 10 a.m. on RSconnect, and more than 800 people had signed up for the event within 24 hours, How-ard said.
He said there is no cap on the 
number of participants in the race.
“The goal is to not limit it and 
encourage as many students as possible to engage in this healthy programming,” Howard said.
Participants may register up 
to the day of the event for $12 if they have a Gator 1 Card, but only those who register by April 15th will be guaranteed a T-shirt.
“Shirts are kind of a part of 
5K culture,” Howard said. “It’s a bragging right.”

Kenya Tolbert closed her eyes 
as layers of Maybelline mascara 
were applied to her eyelashes. She was almost ready for prom.
Tolbert, an 18-year-old senior 
at Eastside High School, almost missed out on the experience due to financial hardship.
Help came in the form of two 
fairy godmothers, seniors at UF, 
who decided to give back to the 
community and help a senior in high school get a prom make-over.
Gabrielle Burch, a 22-year-old 
family, youth and community sciences major, came up with the idea and asked her friend Brooke Cantrell, a 22-year-old agricultur-
al operations management major, 
to help make it happen.
“I know as a senior in my high-
school days, it was just so com-
plicated to get the ticket, the car, 
your hair done, your makeup, 
what you’re going to wear,” Burch 
said. “It was just so much.” 
Burch mentors students at 
Eastside High and said the expo-sure helped her understand the 
barriers they face at the school, 
including the hefty price tags as-sociated with prom.
“We’ve always been involved 
in the Gainesville community,” 
Cantrell said. “We know that 
Eastside High has a lot of kids that go there who can’t afford to 
attend prom.”
Burch talked to Pamela Min-
niefield, a teacher at Eastside 
High School, and asked for her help with advertising the make-
over opportunity.
They gave out fliers and 
opened an online application.
“I just told her it sounds like a 
great idea,” Minniefield said. “So what I did was help her get it ad-
vertised, and it went from there.”
Tolbert was the winner.Burch and Cantrell used their 
own resources to make the trans-
formation possible. They bought 
the hair supplies and used their 
previous experience to do her 
hair themselves.  
They asked a friend who works 
for MAC cosmetics to do the 
makeup, and she did it for free.
“This is something that we just stepped up to the plate and just 
decided to do it,” Cantrell said.
The makeover began at 4 p.m. 
on Friday at Tolbert’s house.
As her entire family waited in 
the living room to see the finished product, Tolbert came down the 
stairs wearing a flowing coral gown. She greeted her date — 
her boyfriend of more than two 
years.
She took pictures with her 
family, thanked the women and 
rode off to the prom, where she 
was nominated for prom queen.
Although she didn’t win, Burch said Tolbert won in her eyes.
Minniefield, the Eastside teach-
er, said Burch and Cantrell’s proj-
ect was thoughtful and caring.
“It seems like they helped 
somebody, so I’m glad,” she said. 
“I hope that they continue to do 
this.” MONDAY, APRIL 7, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

TALLAHASSEE — A Tal-
lahassee attorney embroiled 
in an ongoing land dispute 
with the state contends in a new court filing that Florida 
Attorney General Pam Bon-
di’s office deleted or withheld 
emails he was seeking.
Steven Andrews, who 
has been a persistent critic of Gov. Rick Scott, is involved 
in a lawsuit over attempts by the state to acquire land near 
the Governor’s Mansion. This 
week he filed documents al-leging that Bondi’s office 
failed to promptly turn over 
61 emails sent or received by senior staff.
Andrews and his legal 
team contend that in 19 in-stances, the emails were de-
leted altogether.
Andrews declined to com-
ment on the latest filing, but in it he states Bondi’s office “will-
fully and in bad faith failed to produce or timely produce 
public records.”
Whitney Ray, a spokesman 
for Bondi, would only say the allegations “are completely 
without merit.”
Ray pointed to a March 
20 court filing by Bondi’s of-fice saying her employees 
“went to great length” to ful-
fill numerous requests from Andrews despite what they 
termed his “lack of clarity 
as to the records sought and lack of cooperation in framing 
search parameters.”
Andrews says he has 
turned up internal information that shows Bondi’s employ-
ees manually decide whether to keep copies of emails. He 
has an early 2012 email in 
which an information tech-nology employee warned that 
the archiving system used by 
Bondi’s office could allow in-dividual employees to delete 
or fail to archive emails.
Florida has a broad pub-
lic records law that requires emails and other documents 
to be made public, with ex-emptions for documents that 
cover items such as open 
criminal investigations.
In November, Andrews 
filed three separate lawsuits against Scott, Bondi and the Department of State asking for 
a court to force the officials to 
hand over the records and to pay his attorney fees. His lat-
est filing came in response to 
Bondi’s push to have the case thrown out.Lawsuit: Bondi’s

Four was the lucky number this spring for Gators 
basketball, and with the help of the Gainesville com-
munity, it could be the lucky number for the city’s Summer Heatwave program as well.
In light of the Gators advance to the Final Four, the 
city is asking for a donation for its Summer Heatwave program, said Steven Phillips, director of Parks, Rec-reation and Cultural Affairs for the City of Gainesville. In the spirit of the Final Four, the city suggests incre-ments of four: $4, $40 or $400. 
The department is teaming up with Gainesville Po-
lice to continue the summer program that allows teens to participate in different activities such as pool days, fitness classes and a basketball tournament, he said.
“An update was given to the commission about the 
program being very successful, so (the commissioners are) trying to have us expand it,” Phillips said.
To raise money, the city is using Citizinvestor, a 
website similar to Kickstarter that allows people to donate online and requires the campaign to meet its fund goal of $20,720 to receive the money. 
Both departments were collectively allocated 
$10,000 from the City Commission. Through the cam-paign, organizers are hoping to double the funding and thus, double participation. 
Steve Bradford, youth services sergeant for GPD, 
said the state attorney’s office has noticed a drop in juvenile crime rates in Gainesville during June, July and August when the program is in session.
“It definitely has great benefits compared to the 
cost,” Bradford said. “The kids have something posi-tive to do.” 
Ludovica Weaver, a marketing technician for the 
City of Gainesville, said registration is free for teens who want to participate. 
“It’s a really wonderful opportunity for teenagers 
to have a place to find other young people and to con-nect and to do fun things together in a safe and enrich-ing environment,” Weaver said.Camp seeks donations Final Four-style

Professors, scholars and speak-
ers from across the country trav-
eled to UF over the weekend to at-tend a workshop centered around the theme of trauma in comics and 
graphic novels.  
The various speakers explained 
how traumatic events affect the writ-ers and illustrators of comic books.  
Guest speaker Donna Axel dis-
played how the comic book “Asterix 
and the Black Gold” was used to bring awareness to an environmen-tally traumatic oil spill.
Axel said Albert Uderzo, the 
writer and illustrator, uses comics to bring environmental awareness.
Chris Wilhelm, an assistant histo-
ry professor at the College of Coastal Georgia, brought Marvel superhero comics to the table. He said Swamp Thing and Man-Thing are comics highlighting ecological trauma in the Everglades.  
“In the 20th century, swamp was 
seen as negatively and reflected harsh realities of the world,” Wil-helm said.  
Sol Canal was among several stu-
dents attending the conference for extra class credit.  
Canal, a 20-year-old UF English 
junior, said she enjoyed it.  
“I liked it,” she said. “I didn’t 
know about it, but it was really in-teresting and different, and I liked how Swamp Thing was relative to Florida.”UF hosts trauma comic conference“An update was given to the commission

Thank you, Gators
So, we lost.
We’re devastated, of course, but the truth is that the 
loss doesn’t directly impact our day-to-day lives. Today, 
we’re thrown back into the swirl of classes, looming ﬁ  nals 
and impending graduation dates. It’s more of the same, but something is different.
Actually, it’s us. 
We’re different.
We’ve remembered what it’s like to be Gators, to be a part 
of something bigger than ourselves, to join with thousands of our friends for a common cause.
Often, the Gator Nation seems like an abstract concept 
only used for those “Go write the great American novel” commercials. But after these past few weeks, we ﬁ  nally understand. 
The Gator Nation is at Mother’s, where we sprayed drinks 
over the crowd and screamed along to “Another One Bites the Dust” after the Dayton game. It’s on our laptops, where we watched games on mute during lecture and bit our nails as the shot clock ticked. It’s in the high-ﬁ  ves we gave complete strangers wearing orange and blue at gas stations off I-75.
This year’s Gators were more than distant ﬁ  gureheads. 
Perhaps more than with football, the basketball players seemed accessible. They were in our classes, riding our buses and eating at the tables next to us in Gator Corner Dining 
Center. 
All season, they were genuinely excited about their success, 
and that made us excited too. We read — and retweeted — 
their messages after each game. We saw them at 101 Cantina, wearing cut-down nets around their necks. We posed for 
Instagram selﬁ  es with them.
And so we rooted for them. 
Patric Young, Will Yeguete, Casey Prather, Scottie 
Wilbekin — we say their names like we know them because 
in a way, we do. They’re Gators, and so are we.
On Saturday, Young was the last to leave the court because 
he was hugging each UConn player. If the purpose of sports 
is to connect people, then this year’s Gators men’s basketball team rocked it.
We won together, and we lost together.Athletics may not have a hand in our daily routines, but 
they play an important role in uniting the university. For the ﬁ  rst time in a long time, we felt like a team — all of us, Billy 
Donovan, Bernie Machen and the guy eating wings next to 
us at the bar. Although exams loomed and work persisted, basketball reminded us what a privilege it is to be a Florida Gator.
So, men’s basketball team: Thank you for what you did. But more importantly, thank you for what you did to us.Rush’s vampiring ways are not the issue
A lot of hoopla was made last week over the rev-elation that congressional candidate — and UF graduate  — Jake Rush participated in various 
role-playing games, typically starring as a vampire. The story quickly went national, as various political blogs and news outlets wanted to discover more on the vam-pire who wants to role play as a congressman. 
Given all the crap we see out of Washington, D.C., 
why should we care that Rush moonlights as a vam-pire?  
Sure, it’s a bit strange, but is that because role play-
ing is truly awkward, or is it a lifestyle we just don’t 
understand?
It’s easy to be critical of Rush and his lifestyle, but 
we’re quickly moving into an era when our entire lives 
have been digitally catalogued, and almost all of us 
have posted something questionable on various social 
media sites, message boards or other websites. 
Do you believe that completely disqualiﬁ  es you from 
running for ofﬁ  ce?
Congress is a seething cesspool of inaction, bickering 
and political maneuvering that would not seem out of place in an episode of “House of Cards.” If a vampire wants to serve the citizens of Florida’s 3rd Congressio-nal District, so be it. 
A sizable group of Republican legislators — and 
Rush could be no different for all we know — have made it their job to neuter the Obama administration, preventing the president from accomplishing much of his agenda over the past three years. 
When you refuse to work with the sitting president, 
effectively holding the country hostage, that’s not role-playing. That’s reality. 
Don’t consider that Rush would head into Washing-
ton and help bridge the gap between the Republicans in the House and President Barack Obama. That’s not the case; the man is running as a conservative Republican. However, there are far more 
serious things occurring in D.C. than us worrying about some-
one’s lifestyle, bizarre as it may 
be. 
Last fall, members of Con-
gress took this country to the 
brink of ﬁ  nancial calamity by 
threatening to allow the U.S. to 
default on its debts. 
Fortunately, at the 11th hour, Congress agreed on a 
solution that kept the country from jumping off a cliff. 
To me, that’s far more frightening than Rush spend-
ing his fall pretending he’s a character from an Anne Rice novel. By comparison, it seems quite tame.
Whether it’s Rush or someone who dresses as Mr. 
Spock pretending he’s onboard the U.S.S. Enterprise, Gainesville and the rest of the U.S. deserve members of Congress who put their constituents and the best in-terest of the country ahead of political games and the circus act that plagues our legislative body. 
We can make jokes about someone’s lifestyle, but if 
they’re truly committed to representing the citizens of their district, why shouldn’t we give them a fair shake?
Heck, Louisiana Sen. David Vitter was caught with 
a prostitute while he was wearing a diaper. Now, he’s poised to be Louisiana’s next governor. 
Obviously, enough in that state believe Vitter has 
their best interests in mind despite his odd lifestyle choices. 
Maybe it’s time for us to to reconsider Rush on the 
issues, not his vampiring ways.
And if Rush isn’t the right guy, I think I just saw Mr. 
Spock walking down University Avenue. Maybe he’s 
the right choice for Gainesville.

Last October, a 19-year-old made headlines when 
he announced he would lose his virginity on 
stage in front of a crowd as part of a performance 
art piece. 
Clayton Pettet, the teenag-
er in question, said he would 
have anal sex for a project called “Art School Stole My 
Virginity.” The performance 
happened this past week and raised questions of what con-
stitutes a ﬁ  rst sexual experi-
ence. 
According to Pettet, our 
society holds a lot of value to the idea of virginity, and the project was his way of “losing the stigma around virginity,” according to an article by the Daily Star. 
He brings up an interesting point: Our society does 
reinforce the idea that losing one’s virginity is the end-all and be-all as the ultimate rite of passage into 
adulthood. Even just by using the term “losing your 
virginity,” it implies that having sex for the ﬁ  rst time inherently takes something away and changes some-
thing about you.
As great as sex is, though, it’s not magic. You don’t 
automatically change into something else just because you have had sex one time. 
And what exactly constitutes losing your virginity, 
anyway? 
According to one article by The Atlantic that dis-
cussed myths about virginity, another issue is that 
people are misinformed when it comes to what should 
happen your ﬁ  rst time. 
Have you heard the popular phrase “pop your 
cherry”? It supports the idea that people with vaginas should bleed the ﬁ  rst time they have intercourse be-
cause the penetrative act breaks their hymen. 
That’s not true — you’re not supposed to bleed! 
Bleeding happens when there is not proper lubrication during sexual activity, but by reinforcing this idea, we turn sex into a scary and possibly traumatic event.
And what about gay couples? Do lesbians never 
actually lose their virginity because they do not have penetrative penis-in-vagina sex? 
The concept of virginity is incredibly heteronorma-
tive because of this. Traditionally, a home run is hav-ing penetrative intercourse that involves a penis and 
a vagina. But that leaves out all sorts of other options, 
including digital sex, oral sex, anal sex or even mastur-bation. 
Society cannot dictate what sex is — only the person 
having it can do that. If you think sex is you plus a dil-do, that works. Or if you think virginity is just a social 
construct and does not even exist, well, more power to 
you on that end as well.
All these myths and inaccuracies about virginity cre-
ate a problem. They make ﬁ  rst-time sex a stressful and daunting experience rather than the fun and liberating adventure it should be.
The taboo of losing one’s virginity makes it harder 
for people to ask questions, leading to unsafe sexual practices. We are unable to have conversations about 
sex because there is still such a stigma attached to it.
By spreading myths like this, we turn sex into a big-
ger thing than it really is. As long as the act is consen-sual, it does not matter when you ﬁ  rst have sex or in 
what manner or with whom you do it. 
You are not “losing” anything by doing so, but hav-
ing sex will also not make you more mature or turn you into something you are not.
What will having sex for the ﬁ  rst time do? Well, 
you’ll join the ranks with millions of other people across the world who have had sex, which just goes to show you — sex is normal. 
It shouldn’t be a stressful experience, and we as a 
society need to lose the stigma behind losing your vir-ginity.

opinions@alligator.orgDENVER — In what will go down in his-
tory as the biggest national overdose since America died of alcohol poisoning 
once Prohibition was lifted, the entire state of Colorado has overdosed on marijuana.
“It was an awful sight to see,” Marrie Jones said in be-
tween tears. “I walked in on my son, facedown on the couch. There was a water pipe on the table. His hand was in the Cheetos bag, and cartoons were still playing on the televi-sion.” 
Low-functioning alcoholic and Drug Enforcement Ad-
ministration agent Michael Jimms works to prevent acci-dents like this nationwide.
“Marijuana is one of the most dangerous drugs out there,” 
he slurred while extinguishing his ninth cigarette in a glass of bourbon. “These criminals go out there and do their drugs, act all violent and whatnot.”
Agent Jimms then ﬁ  nished his tenth cigarette and his 
bourbon, went home, beat his wife and yelled at his son for being a “damn, no good (hiccup) junkie.”
Mitchell Johnson was a Ph.D. candidate at Harvard Uni-
versity studying political science but was found guilty of pos-session, and he has since been sentenced to spend 20 years in 
the Bay State Correctional Center.
“They found my cannabis in my car while I was helping 
my charity that helps endangered pandas with cancer from 
inner-city areas to go to college,” said the man who would’ve been the 53rd president of the U.S. had he not gotten in trou-ble for having plants in his glove box. “I mean, it’s bad in here. My cellmate is a former DEA agent who got arrested for getting drunk and beating the sh*t out of his family. He’s only got seven years, though. I de-serve the bigger sentence; my crime affected so many more people.”
Johnson is positive that living in the same 
quarters as people who killed other people will be beneﬁ  cial to his development as a man and won’t cause him to leave prison as a hardened thug with serious and unevaluated psychological issues. 
Despite the bodies piled up in the streets, some people are 
still ﬁ  ghting for its legalization.
“I have really bad glaucoma,” glaucoma-less Mary Jameis 
said, “and anxiety, too. I get super nervous when my friends and I watch ‘Cosmos’ and ‘Animal Planet’ every Sunday 
night. But I’ll tell you what the real crime is,” she said before 
rambling about how 9/11 was an inside job.
Student Matthew Jackson luckily was hospitalized be-
fore the violent effects of a marijuana overdose could take a toll on him. Jackson’s father discovered him in his room giggling at photos of cats doing “people things” on the In-ternet while listening to a politically insightful, post-modern reggae band you’ve probably never heard of. He smelled the marijuana, saw his son’s red eyes and immediately called an 
ambulance.
Dr. Afro Mann was the ﬁ  rst to see Jackson once he reached 
proper medical authorities.
“He was gonna go to class,” said Mann, “but then he got 
high.” 
He added, “La da da da da da da da da”.

Catcalling and verbal harassment 
is unfortunately something that happens all too often. In the 
media, it’s typical to see a woman be shouted at by construction workers 
while she’s walking down the street of 
a highly populated urban area, but this is not always the case.
Verbal harassment can happen basi-
cally anywhere, whether you’re walk-ing to school, out with friends down-town, or even at your favorite coffee shop.
However, one artist in Brooklyn is 
taking a stand for women everywhere and has made an amazing and, to some, enlightening series of art that expresses exactly how women feel about verbal harassment. Tatyana Fazlalizadeh has dedicated her time and efforts to cre-
ating posters of women who want to 
speak out against gender-based verbal 
harassment.
Each portrait is of a different woman 
and has a caption geared toward men 
who think catcalling is an acceptable type of social interaction. Ranging from “Stop Telling Women to Smile” and “My Name is Not Baby,” to “Women Do Not Owe You Their Time or Con-versation,” these simple posters are short, sweet and to the point: Women don’t like being yelled at by strangers.
Women shouldn’t have to pretend 
they didn’t hear a derogatory com-ment, and men shouldn’t feel com-pelled to yell at female strangers. More action is needed so that society stops al-lowing for catcalling to be minimized. However, with activism in art and a new generation of feminists, hopefully, that change is in the near future.

Anyone who looked up at the 
sky above Kay Larkin Field in 
Palatka, Fla., on Saturday would have seen about eight UF students riding their school’s mascot.
The “gator jump,” a stunt that 
involved several members of the UF Falling Gators Skydiving Club clinging to an inflatable alligator while skydiving, wasn’t the only highlight of the UF Falling Gators’ 16th Annual Collegiate Boogie.
The event, hosted by Skydive Palatka and the Falling Gators, took place from 9 a.m. Friday to 7 p.m. Sunday. It included food, more than $1,000 of raffle prizes and an adrenaline rush for the about 75 registered guests and 
other regular visitors.
Throughout the weekend, stu-
dents, alumni and skydivers from 
around the country gathered at Palatka Municipal Airport for its spring boogie, a term used by skydivers to describe large get-togethers. These events begin as days full of jumping from planes 
to partying through the night — and waking up at sunrise to do it 
all again.
Matt Englehart, 27, recently 
moved from California to Jackson-ville and said he had been waiting for an opportunity to try out his 
closest drop zone. As a veteran 
boogie-bouncer, he said Skydive Palatka didn’t disappoint. Along with more than a dozen other reg-istered guests, Englehart set up a tent alongside RVs and a spacious firepit, where jumpers later min-gled and bumped beers around a bonfire.
The boogie brought in skydiv-ers from Georgia, Alabama, Colo-rado, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University’s skydiving club and different regions of Florida, but it attracted first-timers as well.
Skydive Palatka owner Art 
Shaffer said boogies are a great way to bring the skydiving com-munity together, but introducing people to tandem jumping is a rewarding perk too. He estimated about one in 20 people will come back to get certified to jump alone after jumping at Palatka. He said 
the thrill hasn’t worn off in the 29 
years he’s been in the sport.
“As soon as the parachute 
opened, I knew I would be doing this for a long time,” he said about his first jump.
Shanna Ferris, one of Shaffer’s 
tandem students and a UF art se-nior, said she was planning to visit the drop zone that weekend with 
a couple other friends. The event 
kept her occupied as she waited for the morning’s gray clouds to clear.
She said she enjoyed the re-
laxed atmosphere, and the staff made her feel comfortable before her jump. During her five-hour visit, she socialized with the 
club, snacked on sandwiches and 
doughnuts and had an experience she would be eager to try again.
“I’m a convert now,” the 21-
year-old said.

Now in its seventh season, 
Gainesville Fashion Week has 
grown each year in participa-
tion and social media pres-
ence.   
About 550 people attended 
the art, music and fashion 
showcase on Friday and Satur-
day evening at the University Air Center’s Mustang Hangar.
Since GFW officially 
launched in 2009, the event 
has expanded, having gained 
nearly 5,300 likes on Facebook, about 900 followers on Twitter and roughly 800 followers on 
Instagram.
Social media director Niko 
Pifferetti said the team primar-
ily relies on outlets like those  for increasing word-of-mouth 
publicity in addition to its local 
networking events.
“GFW has always been 
good at having innovative marketing techniques,” he said.
Pifferetti, a 24-year-old UF 
public relations and English senior, said the event has culti-vated a meaningful and grow-
ing online presence through 
the multiple platforms it uses to reach its audience.
“We’re very well integrat-
ed,” he said. “We have a team 
of seven social media interns, 
and there’s pretty much one on every platform at any given time making sure that we have 
consistent stream of content.”
The management team has grown as well, Pifferetti said. 
In its first year, fewer than a 
dozen people organized the 
event. Now, the team has ex-panded to almost 50 directors and interns. 
Although the event was 
held at the same location last year, venues from previous years were limited to small-er locations in downtown 
Gainesville.
“Turnout has been increas-
ing every year,” Pifferetti said. 
“This venue really feels much more like a gallery, and I feel 
like you can approach the art 
and appreciate it.”
Director-at-large Ching-Ya 
Ni said although turnover and 
sponsorship levels may vary 
each season, the fashion week has been improving every year.
“Every year I want to bring 
something new to the table,” Ni said. “I feel like this is our best venue here because we’re able to create a really spacious 
and classy ambiance where it’s 
beyond going to another night-club in downtown.”
Over the years, the event 
has come to establish itself as 
a platform that showcases ar-
tistic talent and serves as an accessible resource for local artists, she said.
In the four years Ni has been 
a part of the GFW team, she said the growth of the event has inspired her to continue pursuing her own passions in 
fashion and art. 
“I’ve gone through a lot with 
Gainesville Fashion Week, and 
it’s definitely become my sec-

MIAMI — Engineers say initial success on a tiny 
urban section of the massive Everglades restoration 
plan could provide important lessons for the larger 
project.
The Miami Herald reported Sunday a mini proj-
ect at the Miami Deering Estate shows what could 
happen if the more than $10.5 billion Comprehen-
sive Everglades Restoration Plan is ever fully fund-
ed.
The 2-year-old project is a drop in the bucket, 
part of the larger Biscayne Bay wetland restora-
tion.
It falls within the broader restoration plan. Its 
cost is about $4 million.
Engineer Jorge Jaramillo said the pace of change 
is impressive and shows what could be accom-plished on a broader scale. 
In recent months, lowland sedges, sawgrass and 
other native plants have returned. Springs are bubbling. The trick has been pump-
ing enough water through with submerged electri-cal pumps.
The Everglades restoration plan is an attempt 
to rebuild Florida’s diverse, natural ecosystem, 
in which flocks of birds once soared and panthers 
roamed. 
But the Everglades also serve a practical pur-
pose, too. 
The so-called River of Grass acts as a natural wa-
ter filter and provides water for millions of Ameri-cans.
Environmentalists are happy with the mini proj-
ect’s progress so far.
But they are also frustrated the restoration is 
happening in such small fits and starts. 
They want to see fast-tracked bundled projects 
completed. 
Both chambers of Congress approved bills to 
help pay for restoration in Central Florida, but they have yet to reconcile the proposals.Engineers take small but promising

A well-known street drug is now being

depression.
Ketamine, also known as Special K, is 
being studied by medical professionals 
who are discovering some of the drug’s 
possibilities, according to a study in the 
Journal of Psychopharmacology.
Although researchers haven’t found 
definitive results, they’re hopeful that ketamine can one day be used to help those with mood disorders. 
A news release about the study cites 
ketamine’s “rapid antidepressant effect” on some patients.
Ketamine is used as an anesthetic in 
both veterinary and human medicine, said Richard Holbert, assistant professor of psychiatry and co-director of the Brain Stimulation Center at UF Health Shands Hospital. 
People with depression typically 
have an overactive brain receptor — a molecular device for controlling cognitive and memory function — and ketamine can 
act as an antagonist to that. 
In theory, ketamine can be used to slow down the receptor the same way it does 
when it is being used to sedate someone before surgery, Holbert said.Ketamine is also used as a party drug 
and can cause hallucinations and out-of-body experiences, he said. Dosage will greatly affect the experience 
that someone has with the drug. The research team has given more than 400 
infusions to 45 patients, according to the 
news release about the study.
“There have been a lot of question marks 
about why people are using an illicit drug 
to treat depression,” Holbert said.
The drug doesn’t offer promising 
long-term treatment, but it can help with 
immediate symptoms such as suicidal thoughts, he said.
Erin Rectanus, a 20-year old UF 
psychology junior, said she isn’t opposed to this type of treatment as long as it’s a last resort for recovery.  
“If all other forms of treatment have 
been proven unsuccessful then I would be OK with using or recommending this drug even though it is a street drug,” she said.
However, Holbert said there is always a 
risk for addiction.
“When you use anything for a long 
period of time, there’s absolutely a chance you can get addicted,” he said.
Still, he thinks it’s a possibility that 
more research can lead to more positive results.
“I’m hopeful but always skeptical,” he 
said. “We still know so little.”MONDAY, APRIL 7, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

A recent study has examined that ketamine, also known as Special K, can possibly 
help in the treatment of depression. It has also been shown to have more immediate effects on those with more serious types of depression.

The south shore of Lake Wauburg was 
crowded with enthusiastic UF students and 
alumni Saturday for Wakefest, the Gator Wakeboard Club’s biggest fundraiser.
During the course of the day, about 500 
people lined the docks and waterfront to watch UF students and alumni compete in six divisions.
“Today is just a huge party at Lake 
Wauburg,” said Jon Kistemaker, the club’s president.
Riders had the opportunity to perform 
about 10 tricks in the two trips each par-ticipant was granted around the lake, the 21-year-old UF biology senior said. Com-petitors were judged based on height, style and difficulty of the tricks.
The fundraiser was a success, Kistemak-
er said. The club managed to raise more than $2,000 after expenses. That is short of the club’s goal of $3,200, but he said the difference should be made up with upcom-ing events. 
About $2,000 of the club’s funding 
comes from RecSports, said Jon Broska, assistant director of competitive sports at UF.
The club predicted it still needed to raise $3,200 if it wished to continue operating.
However, Broska said that the money 
the club needed was just a reflection of predicted deficits. The money might be available by Summer.
“We didn’t want to wait until Summer 
to tell the wakeboard club,” he said.
Broska said he wanted to dispel any no-
tion that the club was facing dissolution.
“’Sorry, you can’t be a club anymore’ — 
that was not a conversation with the wake-board club at all,” he said. UF wakeboarding club hosts competition to raise funds� IT CUT THE UTILITY BILL BY 40 PERCENT.

A UF-developed system installed in Pugh Hall 
last year has proved to be a breath of fresh air for 
sustainability on campus.  
Recent data shows that the air conditioning 
regulation system, activated in April 2013, cut the 
building’s utility bill by 40 percent. 
Prabir Barooah, a UF associate mechanical and 
aerospace engineering professor, worked with a re-
search team for four years to develop the system. 
Barooah said they developed wireless sensors 
that measure temperature, humidity, carbon diox-ide concentration and room occupancy and trans-mit that data to a computer server.
“The software looks at, in real time, what’s 
happening in the room, and based on whether the room is occupied or not, based on whether it’s too hot, based on all that information, it decides what to do about the air flow rate and the heating and cooling in the room,” Barooah said.He said the team is now working with the 
Physical Plant Division to install the system in two more buildings on campus. Barooah said the sys-tem could be especially useful in older buildings.
“There are all these existing buildings that are 
inefficient, and we can retrofit this technology on them, and that’ll save energy,” he said.
He said sensors cost about $200 each. A build-
ing like Pugh Hall would need about 70 sensors.  
Jonathan Brooks, a UF mechanical engineering 
Ph.D. student who worked on the team, said 75 percent of all energy use comes from buildings. 
“The entire industry is kind of in its infancy, 
so this is right on the edge of figuring out how to 
make it commercialized and profitable,” Brooks 
said.
Matthew Williams, the director of UF’s Office 
of Sustainability, said sensors could be valuable in reducing utility costs and greenhouse gas emis-sions on campus.
“That project in particular is really interesting 
because it shows how we could be using the ex-pertise here on campus to solve campus needs,” he 
said.Pugh Hall’s UF-designed air 
control system cuts emissionsSTATE
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TAMPA — The humble blueber-
ry is enjoying a bonanza in Florida.
In the last decade, the area har-
vested with blueberries in Florida 
has tripled, the Tampa Bay Times 
reported Saturday.
This year’s crop is expected to 
reach about 25 million pounds. 
That’s small-time compared with the top producer, Chile, which ex-ports about 174 million pounds, mostly to the U.S.
But it’s not that far off the U.S. 
blueberry leader, Michigan, which 
produced about 87 million pounds 
in 2012.
Farmers say experts at the UF’s 
Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences are behind the growth. Their Plant Innovation Program developed about 98 percent of the southern highbush berries now grown in the state.
Grower Alto Straughn said the UF version of the fruit “are bet-ter, bigger, tastier and with a better 
yield.”
There’s something else about 
blueberries that makes growers 
happy. Machine-picking them is easier than crops like strawberries, a benefit at a time when immigration reform is at a standstill, and farm-ers complain they can’t find enough harvesters in the U.S.
Blueberries generated nearly $70 
million in cash receipts in 2011, up from $39 million in 2007.
Fresh blueberries can be found 
in grocery stores all yearlong these days, but Florida is grabbing the market share from around March to June, coming in at the end of the South American harvest but before 
things warm up enough along the 
Atlantic seaboard and Pacific north-west. 
Farmers say they hope to expand 
their season even more in the com-ing years.Florida blueberry bushes

ARLINGTON, Texas — Scottie Wilbekin 
had every reason to perform well Saturday against UConn.The senior point guard was competing in 
his ﬁ  rst and last Final Four, playing against a familiar foe and – as the proverbial cherry on top – celebrating his 21st birthday on the most important day of basketball in his life.
So when Wilbekin had arguably his 
worst game of the season Saturday night, Gators fans were left scratching their heads all the way back to Gainesville.Coach Billy Donovan said the reason 
why his team’s MVP was limited to just four points on 2-of-9 shooting was because he could not penetrate the Huskies’ defense in the paint.
Because Wilbekin could not drive to the 
basket as he had all season, he not only couldn’t be a factor scoring-wise for the Gators, but he also could not dish the ball back out to the perimeter to give his team-mates open looks. The 6-foot-2 Gainesville native had just one assist compared to three turnovers.
“The difference in the game was Scot-
tie Wilbekin couldn’t live in the lane like he had all year long for us,” Donovan said. “Every time we needed a big shot or a big play, whether against Arkansas or UCLA, he was in the lane.”
Only one of Wilbekin’s two baskets 
came in the paint, and neither came in the second half when Florida desperately need-ed a spark to overcome UConn’s 12-point 
advantage, which was the Gators’ largest 
deﬁ  cit of the season.
Although he said cramps bothered him 
at the start of the second half, Wilbekin said once he exited the game and iced his legs, 
the cramps went away and were no longer 
an issue.
However, UConn guards Ryan Boat-
wright and Shabazz Napier were problems Wilbekin couldn’t ﬁ  x with a few minutes on the bench. After allowing Wilbekin to score on his ﬁ  rst two shot attempts, Boatright and 
Napier buckled down defensively, holding 
the Southeastern Conference Player of the 
Year to a 0-of-7 shooting performance – in-cluding 0 of 3 from three-point range.
“He had a really, really hard time getting 
in the lane around Boatright,” Donovan 
said. “He had a hard time getting around 
Napier, which inevitably made our offense very, very difﬁ  cult.

ARLINGTON, Texas 
— Now that the Gators’ season is of-
ﬁ  cially over, let’s put their 30-game winning streak in perspective.
It is the 10th-longest win-
ning streak in college basket-
ball history, the longest of 
Billy Donovan’s coaching career and the longest in program history. Most teams struggle to win 30 games in a season, let alone 30 straight. 
But it’s more than the 
number 30 itself that makes 
this streak so special. It goes 
much deeper than that.
Following No. 1 overall 
seed UF’s disappointing 63-
53 defeat to 7-seed UConn 
in the NCAA Tournament 
semiﬁ  nals on Saturday, Billy Donovan expressed that sentiment. The 18-year UF’s growth deﬁ  nes streakGYMNASTICS

Florida may have fallen — but not too 
far. 
Despite falls from top competitors Mack-
enzie Caquatto, Bridget Sloan and Kytra 
Hunter, Florida claimed the 2014 Univer-
sity Park Regional title to advance to the 
NCAA Championship.
“When Bridget and Mackenzie fell – it is 
so uncharacteristic for both of them,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “I think that is the ﬁ  rst time Macko has fallen in two years. And 
Bridget is a 9.95 almost every time she gets 
up there.” 
Both Sloan and Caquatto suffered falls on beam. Sloan ended up with a 9.225 and 
Caquatto a 9.300, resulting in a 48.575 team 
score on beam that claimed the bottom spot in the meet and Florida’s 2014 record book.
“I would say our competition was off,” 
Faehn said. “It was not what we are capable of.” 
The Gators then had some down time 
with about a 20-minute bye before they competed on ﬂ  oor. Normally one of its top 
events, Florida posted a 49.375 on ﬂ  oor, its 
second lowest event score of the night.
UF’s saving grace was vault, where it 
posted a meet-best 49.550 to cap off its time in University Park, Penn.

“Well time to say goodbye to the beard.” 
Patric Young (@BigPatYoung4)
UF senior centerJONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Staff Writer @jczupryn
“I love being in school right now. 
I like getting my education. I’m learn-
ing more from coach (Billy Donovan) 
and he’s got a lot to offer me. He’s go-
ing to help develop me so when I go to the NBA, I’ll already be ready and teams won’t have to worry about developing 
me anymore.”
Patric Young made that state-
ment on March 11, 2011. A year 
later, he made the same decision. A year after that, the message still 
didn’t change.
But Young did.
He grew from the bench player 
who averaged just 3.4 points and 3.8 
rebounds per game to the face of the 
program who finished the year av-eraging 11 points and 6.2 boards.
He grew from being the mentee 
of Vernon Macklin to becoming a 
mentor himself by passing down his 
knowledge of the game onto fresh-man-phenom Chris Walker.
Most importantly to Donovan, 
Young grew enough during his four years at Florida to recognize his own identity both on and off the court.
With his unique physique and 
intense work ethic, the Jacksonville 
native flirted with the possibility 
of becoming a first-round selection in the NBA draft after his fresh-man campaign. But after struggling 
during his next two years to sepa-
rate himself from the pack of other future-NBA frontcourt players like 
Anthony Davis and Nerlens Noel, 
Young decided to stay in Gainesville to fine tune his game and also poten-tially reach the Final Four, which he finally did Saturday.
And despite falling short of the 
national championship – the ulti-mate pinnacle of success – Florida did not lose to UConn for lack of ef-fort from Young.
The senior center recorded a 
season- and team-high 19 points on 7-of-13 shooting while grabbing five rebounds. But much of Young’s im-
pact was seen beyond the statsheet. 
As he has done all season, Young 
battled for loose balls, hustled for all 
of his 32 minutes of action and never lost hope.
“I think I was just trying to get the 
guys just to stay in the moment and just keep pushing on from the past because we have been a team that’s 
come from behind a lot, especially 
late in the season,” Young said. “I thought that if we just picked it up a 
little bit more, just forgot about how 
we were shooting and just locked in and focused, we could have it come again.”
Even in the midst of the Hus-
kies’ 11-of-12 shooting performance down the stretch that sealed their victory over the Gators, Young put all his energy into a dunk with 4:09 
left in the game that kept the basket 
shaking for about 10 seconds.
The 160-foot video board at 
AT&T Stadium showed a jumper by 
UConn’s Niels Giffey when Young 
cut Florida’s deficit down to six with his slam-dunk. Most of the record-
breaking crowd of 79,444 didn’t 
have a chance to react to the play.
And neither did Young, who  
simply ran back to other side of the 
court to prepare on defense. 
There was no flash, just gravitas. 
There was no selfishness, just team 
focus.
“I think for the first time in my 
life, I was a part of a group of guys that were really willing to bleed for one another,” Young said. “Guys that were really willing to just do 
whatever it took to go outside of 
themselves, to commit to the greater goal.”
As Young sat next to two of his 
three senior teammates during the postgame press conference, his last words to the public while still wear-
ing his No. 4 jersey weren’t about 
himself or his upcoming journey to the NBA. Instead – like the past four years – Young was focused on noth-ing but the Florida Gators.
“One thing I can take from this 
team is just when you can truly love a group of guys or people like this, you bring out the best out of them 
and you bring out the best out of 
yourself,” Young said.

Bobby Poyner, usually reliable, found 
himself in the middle of Kentucky’s of-
fensive outburst in Florida’s series finale in Lexington, Ky.
The junior 
left-hander, UF’s third pitcher on Sunday, allowed 
five earned runs in the sixth inning en route to a 9-8 loss at Cliff Hagan Stadium. No. 13 Florida (20-12, 7-5 Southeastern Conference) dropped the finale against No. 22 Kentucky (22-10, 6-6 SEC) for its second-straight SEC road series loss.
Poyner gave up a three-run home run 
to Max Kuhn before hitting A.J. Reed for his last batter. Right-hander Shaun An-derson then replaced Poyner, surrender-ing a triple and a single as part of the seven-run inning that had become the theme of the weekend for both teams.
In Game 2 on Saturday, Florida held 
off a Kentucky rally after jumping out 
to a nine-run lead before winning 11-10. 
Florida plated five runs in the eighth on Sunday in a rally that would ultimately fall short.
“It’s a tough stretch of the season, but 
we’re going to build off these five runs in the eighth. It’s disappointing with our pitching this weekend. We didn’t quite 
stay away from the big inning,” Gators 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan told the IMG Gator Sports Network. “I think that’s the theme of the weekend. We couldn’t stay away from the big inning.”
Left-hander Kirby Snead tossed 2.2 
innings of two-run ball on Sunday. His lone mistake came on a first-pitch fast-ball over the middle that Reed hit into 
left center for his third home run of the 
weekend. The solo shot tied the game at two after UF scored two runs in the top half on a Richie Martin double.
A throwing error by Kentucky short-
stop Matt Reida ruined a double-play chance and extended the inning. He booted a ground ball in the sixth that would’ve been the second out of the in-
ning.

After winning its first two games against 
Auburn on Friday and Saturday, Florida 
knew it needed a strong outing to clinch its first series sweep of the season on Sunday.
And behind an eight-
inning shutout by senior 
Hannah Rogers, the No. 6 Gators (34-8, 8-7 Southeast-ern Conference) notched a 1-0 win over the No. 19 Tigers (31-9-1, 6-6 SEC) at Katie Seashole Pressly Sta-dium.
“I’m excited,” junior 
Lauren Haeger said. “We haven’t swept all season. It’s been a while since we won a se-ries, so it’s always nice to win.”
With the game scoreless in the bottom of 
the eighth, Florida came to bat with the top of the lineup due up. After Kelsey Stewart grounded out to first base, sophomore Kirsti Merritt hit a double to center field. Haeger then scored Merritt with a go-ahead single 
to center field.
“If (Merritt) doesn’t get on base, I don’t 
even have a chance,” Haeger said. “She hit a hard ball up the middle and hustled to sec-
ond to make that a double. ... I just wanted to get a base hit; I can’t get too picky.”
In her fifth shutout of the season, Rogers 
(16-6) limited Auburn to just four hits while retiring 14 straight batters to end the game. 
“The biggest thing that I really looked 
forward to was Hannah Rogers throwing a shutout,” coach Tim Walton said. “Not only a regular shutout, but going the extra inning variety. She really pitched well.”
While Rogers only struck out three of the 
26 batters she faced, stout defense provided the senior right-hander some insurance.
Junior shortstop Katie Medina, who 
started all three games of the series after not being in the starting lineup for 15 straight games, was part of two double plays in the first two innings for the Gators. With two outs and the bases loaded in the third frame, Medina grabbed a groundball from Auburn center fielder Morgan Estell and threw it to catcher Aubree Munro who tagged left 
fielder Tiffany Howard out at home to take 
Florida out of a bind.
“She’s been working hard,” Rogers said 
of Medina. “Obviously she hasn’t been play-ing as much, but when she does play, she works hard.”Rogers shuts out Auburn

“I would say this, there’s not many 
guards that we have played against that 
have kept Scottie Wilbekin out of the lane. 
These guys kept him out of the lane.”
The Huskies not only kept the pressure 
on Wilbekin the entire game, but they also 
forced the rest of the Gators to make errant 
shots and passes as well. 
Florida’s three assists were not just a 
season low. It was also the fewest in a Fi-
nal Four game since assists became an of-ficial stat in 1983-1984. 
And two of its three assists came on the 
first two baskets of the game. For the final 38:43, the Huskies held the Gators to just one assist while forcing 11 turnovers.
“That’s crazy,” Wilbekin said. “That’s 
not usually what we do. All credit goes to them and their guards and the way they were denying and putting pressure on us. We weren’t taking care of the ball.”
Despite Wilbekin’s poor performance 
in his last collegiate contest, Donovan doesn’t want Saturday’s game to be a de-fining moment of the senior’s career. In his 
four years at Florida, Wilbekin has battled 
through off-the-court issues to help his team reach the Elite Eight four seasons in a row, which culminated in the senior’s first Final Four appearance Saturday night.
“We would not be in this situation if it 
was not for Scottie Wilbekin,” Donovan said during the post-game press confer-ence. “You just never want to see a guy in 
his senior year do all things that he’s done, 
you just wish he could have played and performed a little bit better for us. But if it wasn’t for him, I wouldn’t be sitting up here right now.”Florida coach, who masterful-ly transformed a Gators team 
riddled by injuries and suspen-
sions at the beginning of the year into a Final Four squad by late March, delivered a telling answer to a reporter’s question.
“Every coach sits up here 
and is so proud of my guys, I’m so proud of my guys,” Dono-van said.  “Me being proud of 
them is from a totally different 
perspective, because for me 
personally, I saw how dysfunc-tional we were in September.  
Didn’t even know what we would look like.”
The Gators looked like an 
unconstructed jigsaw puzzle in the preseason and first month of the regular season.
Senior point guard Scottie 
Wilbekin remained suspended after months in Donovan’s dog-house, and it was a giant ques-tion mark whether he would 
play this season. Many thought 
Wilbekin might transfer, and the Gainesville native contem-plated it briefly.
Versatile forward Dorian 
Finney-Smith and center Da-montre Harris also served sus-pensions for violating team rules. Donovan dismissed Harris from UF in December, but the South Carolina trans-
fer would soon rejoin the team 
during practices. 
Regardless, it left UF down 
a big man.
Before the start of the regu-
lar season, Michael Frazier II battled mononucleosis, and Will Yeguete was still not at 100 percent coming off arthroscopic 
debridement on his right knee 
in May. Rutgers transfer Eli Carter (broken leg) and Dillon Graham (bone spurs in hips) 
had their seasons shut down.Freshman point guard 
Kasey Hill suffered a high-an-
kle sprain not even two weeks 
into the regular season and 
missed four games. Wilbekin returned after a five-game sus-pension on Nov. 25 only to suffer a sprained ankle a week 
later against the Huskies.
Every day, it was a new set-
back. Donovan’s group could 
not catch a break.
Due to its shifting parts, 
Florida lacked sound defense to kick off the year. After UF surrendered 69 points to North Florida of all teams in its season 
opener on Nov. 8, Donovan 
ripped his shorthanded unit. 
“We are light years away 
from even being remotely a 
good defensive team and light 
years away from even being a ranked team,” he said after the game with a crisp tone.
But after the UConn loss, 
things began working in the Gators’ favor. Wilbekin was back in the mix. Hill returned and provided sufficient relief as 
a backup for Wilbekin. Senior 
forward Casey Prather contin-ued to build on his breakout year. Patric Young began to harness his physical attributes 
as UF’s starting center. 
In February, a once academ-
ically ineligible Chris Walker finally made his debut after 
serving a 12-game suspension handed by the NCAA for re-ceiving impermissible benefits 
from agents. The freshman for-
ward soon found his role, pro-viding athleticism and another body for UF off the bench.
The Gators were clicking. 
Over a few months, a team of just parts gradually became a well-oiled machine.
During its historic streak, 
Florida grinded out quality wins against Kansas, Memphis, Kentucky and Tennessee — the latter two three times each. Donovan’s group cut down 
the nets on three separate occa-
sions, the final time in celebra-tion of his program’s first trip to the Final Four since 2007. 
There’s no way the Gators 
would have achieved these milestones if it weren’t for how well they overcame adversity — a popular but relevant cliché.
“Everyone’s just grown so 
much,” Young said. “You just 
have to look and that and re-
member that.”
Anyone who looks at a re-
cord book 10 years from now might not realize that, but a 
simple number cannot measure 
how remarkable 2013-14 was for Florida.

Florida’s starters huddle prior to the start of Florida’s win 
over Dayton on March 29 in FedExForum in Memphis, Tenn.
Johnson wins all-around with strong showing on bars, floor
that was the fight I was looking 
for,” Faehn said. 
“I thought we had a few un-
characteristic mistakes on differ-ent routines from different peo-ple – almost fluky.”
Penn State claimed the second 
spot on the podium and the final 
ticket to nationals with a 196.725 
total. Florida’s 197.050 mark was the second lowest the team has 
posted all year.
“Today’s performance was a 
little uncharacteristic, but at the same time these competitions are 
what make us stronger, are what make us think and work harder 
in the gym,” Sloan said in a post-
game press conference. “Obvi-ously we didn’t want to happen quite like this, but in the end you 
have to look back on it and take it and learn from it.” 
A fall from Hunter on bars 
scored her a 9.275, which in turn 
took her out of the all-around 
competition. Sloan’s beam fall 
had the same effect on her all-around (39.050), allowing Alaina 
Johnson to claim her second all-
around win of the year with a score of 39.550.
For a meet that Faehn called 
Florida’s roughest competition yet, the Gators managed to win 
each event on top of UF’s third 
consecutive regional title. 
Sloan won vault with a 9.950 
and tied with Caquatto (9.95) for the top spot on bars. Johnson’s 9.850 on beam tied her for a title 
win with three other gymnasts, 
and Hunter’s floor routine deliv-ered a 9.950 and event title win. 
“It’s definitely my favorite 
routine of all three years,” Hunt-er said, “and so I think with me 
loving the routine and being able 
to sell the dance and the tumbling putting it all together definitely 
helped me get a good score.”
Florida will now prepare to 
defend the program’s first na-
tional championship in Birming-
ham, Ala., on April 18-19. 
“The athletes are resilient,” 
Faehn said. “They’ll be anxious to get back in the gym.”gyM , from page 13Uncertainty plagued Gators at season’s start

“We rebounded really 
well on vault and that was 
the fight I was looking for.

uncharacteristic mistakes 
on different routines from 
different people – almost 
fluky.”

UF Coachback tears, battling to keep his com-
posure and answer each question. Michael Frazier II, who was con-
tained to just one three-pointer for 
the Gators’ only make from down-town all night, looked dejected as a hoard of reporters held recorders to 
his face. Other Florida players sat 
away from reporters, staring at the ground with towels hanging over their heads, thinking about what could have been. 
“I really wanted our guys to get 
a fire in their eyes and just realize like, ‘This is going to be the rest of our lives,’” said senior center 
Patric Young, who finished with a 
team-high 19 points. “‘Let’s just go out there and leave it all out on the court. Whatever happens, let’s just go out there and fight and be the 
best that we can be.’
“But I just feel like we were 
a step too slow [Saturday]. I just 
didn’t see it in our guys’ eyes to-
day. I was just trying so hard to get 
us connected from that standpoint, but it just wasn’t there.”
After relinquishing a 12-point 
lead in the first half, the Gators 
could not bounce back. They had 
a season-low 22 points at halftime and saw Shabazz Napier, DeAndre Daniels and the Huskies exploit 
their defense for a 10-point advan-
tage about seven minutes into the second half.
“We knew they were going 
to come back and make a run,” 
Prather said. “They’re a good team. 
That’s what good teams do.”
Young took over down the 
stretch and flourished in the inte-
rior, helping UF cut its deficit to 43-40 with 8:03 left. The senior cen-
ter scored 16 of Florida’s final 22 points.
But he could not do it all alone. 
Excluding Young and Prather, 
who added 15 points, the Gators 
shot only 6 of 26 from the field against Connecticut. A squad that 
prides itself on being connected, 
Florida recorded only three assists against 11 turnovers.
Scottie Wilbekin, who entered 
the game averaging 16.8 points 
during UF’s first four games of the 
Big Dance, battled cramps Saturday and scored just four points on 2-of-9 shooting.
“On offense, we just couldn’t re-
ally get anything going,” the senior point guard said.
“They were being really aggres-
sive and we couldn’t really get into 
our offense. We weren’t moving the 
ball as well.” 
Despite a bitter and abrupt close 
to the year, the Gators have not lost 
perspective of how magical this 
season was for them. 
After battling through injuries 
and suspensions during the first month of the year, Florida even-
tually gelled and ran through its 
Southeastern Conference slate un-defeated, clinching both the regu-lar-season and tournament titles. 
Its senior class of Prather, Wilbekin, 
Young and Will Yeguete that exited the Elite Eight in three previous seasons finally got over the hump, reaching the program’s first Final 
Four since it won back-to-back titles 
in 2006 and 2007 during the glory days of Joakim Noah, Al Horford and Corey Brewer. 
“I think for the first time in my 
life, I was a part of a group of guys that were really willing to bleed for one another,” Young said,  “Guys 
that were really willing to just do whatever it took to go outside of themselves, to commit to the great-
er goal.”
Once the pain of losing against 
the Huskies subsides, the Gators 
will relish a 2013-14 campaign filled with records and accomplishments — one that Donovan can call one of the most successful of his 18-year tenure at UF.
“Their body of work on the court 
people will evaluate or judge them-selves,” Donovan said. “But for me personally, where they were as in-dividuals and where they were as a team to where they came from in terms of becoming a team, I mean, it was one of the most special ex-
periences I’ve had being around a 
group of guys away from the court maybe since I’ve been in coach-ing.”
