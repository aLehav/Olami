forehead to the carpet, which is green and striped with

Mohammad Haider spent his Saturday evening at the Is-
lamic Center of Gainesville, mostly in prayer.
After about 20 minutes of solitary worship, 
he discusses scripture and then sings the eve-ning call to prayer, which is broadcast through-out the building and into the back parking lot 
by a network of speakers.
“When we pray together, we have to consider the old and 
the sick, who may not be able to go for a long time,” Haider said. “But when we pray alone, we can take as long as we like.”
Said to be in his 60s, Haider stands out in a group mostly 
made up of men under 30, most of whom are connected to UF.

The body of UF student Thad Owens, who 
was swept away while swimming in a river in 
Namibia, Africa, was found on Saturday.
Owens was in Africa as part of a study 
abroad program with UF’s wildlife ecology 
and conservation department. On Thursday, he was swimming in the 
Kunene River, near the border of Namibia and 
Angola, when he got caught in the current and went missing, according to news reports.
A search effort was launched with help 
from the Namibian government, the U.S. Em-
bassy, local villagers and private search teams, 
said William Dippel, the Owens’ family attor-ney.
His body was found in the river, according to a statement from UF.
Owens was a 27-year-old 
wildlife ecology and conser-vation major, according to news reports.
He began attending UF 
in the spring of 2007 after transferring from Valencia Community College in Or-
lando, according to The Gainesville Sun.The semester-long study abroad program 
in Namibia was launched last spring, accord-ing to UF’s Web site.
About 10 students are enrolled, according 
to the program’s Web site. 
In addition to working on research projects 
— with students split into groups looking at birds, reptiles and mammals — students spent UF student drowns while studying abroad

Spoken-word poets, both new

Featured poet Ishle Park also per-

heritage, love and war. One poem discussed the challenges of being in a relationship with a soldier.
“Yes, this is a love poem, tucked 
inside a war poem,” Park said to the crowd. “For women left with love bites, roses, bruises, babies and long-ing stretched wider than any flag.”About 15 other poets performed, 
with works discussing identity, poli-tics and family.

A Gainesville man was arrested Friday af-
ter he was accused of beating his girlfriend and 
trapping her in their apartment.
Albert Andrews, 28, got into a verbal fight 
with his girlfriend after she tried giving her daughter a piece of candy. 
According to the Gainesville Police Depart-
ment arrest report, the fight escalated into An-drews throwing two televisions. Andrews then pushed the woman through a glass window, shattering it and slicing a one-inch-deep cut into her right arm. The three times she tried to call the police, Andrews took the phones away from her and broke them. Andrews then trapped her in a room by putting a bed in front of the door. After her arm bled for 30 minutes, the woman escaped to her neighbor’s house and called the police, according to the report.
Andrews was charged with three felonies 
including aggravated battery and false impris-onment.

NASA to announce mod -
ule name on Colbert show
NEW YORK (AP) — Stephen 
Colbert is still clinging to hope 
that NASA will name a new room at the international space station after him.
The space agency said Friday 
it would announce the name of the module Tuesday on Comedy Central’s “The Colbert Report.” Astronaut Sunita Williams will appear on the program.
The agency held an online 
contest, letting the public vote on a name for a future addition 
to the station. “Colbert” beat out 
NASA’s four suggested options: Serenity, Legacy, Earthrise and Venture.
The comedian said in a state-
ment: “I certainly hope NASA does the right thing. Just kidding. I hope they name it after me.”
Faithful gather on Easter

MENA, Ark. (AP) — Easter 
Sunday prayers were offered for 
victims of deadly storms that hit western Arkansas and the South-east last week with signs of dam-
age done by a tornado evident 
throughout St. Agnes Church.

gaped open in broken spots and rainwater leaked down the back of a display showing Christ be-ing led to the cross. Even among the bread wafers offered for Holy Communion, a small twig stuck 
out — a remnant of the tornado LOCAL
About 7,000 lose power
A fault in underground distri-
bution lines caused power loss for 
about 7,000 residences and busi-nesses in the area surrounding the intersection of East University 
Avenue and Waldo Road Friday, 
according to Gainesville Regional Utilities spokesman Dan Clark. Clark said faults on underground lines are rare because compared to above-ground lines, they are safer from storms and trees bumping into them.
The outage occurred between 
about 2 p.m. and 3 p.m.
“If we could schedule the out-
ages,” Clark said, “that would be a perfect time to do it.”
He said that it didn’t cost the 
company extra money to fix the fault because people were already on the clock.
Mher Kalifa, manager of Food 
Max on East University Avenue, said the power was out for more than an hour and estimated the store’s loss at $200 to 500.
“That’s our busy time,” she 
said. “We lost a lot of business.”
The Walgreens on East Univer-
sity Avenue lost power for about 45 minutes, but manager Karl said 
the store did not suffer a significant 
loss.
“Fortunately with a company 
like Walgreens, there’s a store within 2 miles in every direction, basically,” he said.

Islam on Campus, prepared for 
Jum’ah, or weekly service, at the Center. About 100 to 120 people attend Friday prayer at the Cen-ter every week. The largest atten-
dance each year is Eid al-Fitr, “the 
festival of the breaking fast” at the end of Ramadan.
The Center, which is a mosque, 
is divided in two, one entrance and worship area for women and another for men. This prevents dis-traction during worship, accord-ing to Mohammed Suliman, a UF 
student who attends the Center.
After removing his sandals, Za-
fur sat on the carpeted ﬂ  oor of the 
worship area facing the khateeb, who gives the sermon, along with about 40 other men, only two of whom were seated in chairs.
The role of khateeb is usually 
ﬁ  lled by an imam, a Muslim re-
ligious leader, but in Gainesville 
khateebs are often respected Mus-lims with no ofﬁ  cial title. It is dif-ﬁ  cult to keep an imam because the student population cycles through every four years, Zafur said.
In Friday’s sermon, the khateeb 
spoke about the Islamic concept of personal responsibility and how 
it differs from the Christian view-
point.
A core concept of Islam, some 
say the most important, is the “oneness of God,” or Allah in Arabic. To Muslims, Jesus was a prophet, but not divine, as taught in Christianity.“No prophet is responsible for 
our deeds,” the khateeb said, while standing behind a lectern bearing the Quran’s ﬁ  rst two pages in Ara-bic calligraphy.
In Islam, when a Muslim stands 
judgment, he or she is directly responsible for all of their deeds, good and bad, he said.
“When reading the Quran re-
peatedly, the message is ‘you are responsible for yourself,’” he said.
The teaching of personal ac-
countability is often paired with personal responsibility. Islam teaches that Muslims 
should help those in need, regard-less of their faith, said Asad Pat-
wary, who attends the Center.
Following the service, Za-
fur was taken aside by a Muslim 
brother and asked for assistance.
Zafur drove the man about 
eight blocks to Gainesville Lodge on West University and rented him a $45 room for the night.
“Sometimes I worry about 
making ends meet,” Zafur said. “But every time I’m asked for help I give it, and everything turns out at the end of the month.”
Islam teaches that those who 
are generous are rewarded both in this life and the next, he said.
Patwary had advice for people 
interested in learning more about 
Islam and Muslims.
“Just come yourself and ques-
tion with the curiosity you have,” 
he said. “Just have respect for the place and have an open mind.” Islam teaches responsibility

� TWO ONE-HOUR SESSIONS WILL 
BE HELD AT YON HALL.

Alligator Writer
About 90 students will learn basic life-sav-
ing techniques today at UF’s Gator Saver Day, hosted by the UF’s Student Health Care Cen-
ter and Student Government.
Two one-hour sessions will be held be-
tween 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. at Yon Hall in the east side of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
Kelee Patterson, an intern at the center, 
said  students will not become CPR certified because of time and cost restrictions, but they will receive an instructional DVD and practice mannequin.Patterson said CPR is a valuable skill be-
cause the six to 10 minutes in which an ambu-
lance will arrive is all the time it 
takes for those in cardiac arrest 
to die.
SG gave funding to help pur-
chase the $35 training kits each 
student will use during the event.
Patterson said online registration is closed 
for today’s free event, but to nab last-minute spots, students can call the CPR & Safety Training Center at 352-392-1161, ext. 4283. 
While today’s training is reserved for inter-
ested students, the second session on April 25 is open to the entire Gainesville community.
Registration is available at the Web site uf-
gatorsaver.weebly.com. Patterson said the sec-ond event will take place at Kanapaha Middle School on Tower Road between 9 a.m. and noon and will cost $10.UF hosts sessions to teach basic life-saving techniquesBy KATIE EMMETS

Penises, vaginas and breasts! Oh 
my!
These were the subjects of mag-
ic-marker drawings featured in local artist Tom Miller’s art show 
Friday night at The Story House. 
“Paintings and Dirty Little Magic Marker Drawings,” which featured 10 paintings and 45 drawings by Miller, was his first painting show in over 10 years.
While DJ Migraine mixed beats, 
guests drank wine and beer they brought themselves as they moved 
from one sexual, comical image to 
the next.
Miller said the drawings, which 
take him only a minute and a half to draw, fulfill his filthy need to enter-tain and freak people out.
While holding a bottled beer 
in one hand and a marker in the other, Miller drew a picture in three minutes, of an exaggeratedly large-headed man picking his nose. The caption read: “You can pick your … etc. etc. etc.” 
Miller later sat at an old type-
writer and typed poetry with his 
index fingers. 
“People who show their art at 
The Story House are very dedicated 
to what they do,” said Wendy Mi-chael, one of its owners.
Michael described Miller’s art as 
witty and simple. 
“I love that he can make some-
thing happen in a matter of three 
minutes,” Michael said. “He’s able 
to do it right on the fly.”
Charles Ray Martin, who plays 
in the band The Righteous Kind with Miller, said he wasn’t sur-prised by the sexual parody in Fri-day’s show. 
“It’s something that we live ev-
ery day, but don’t talk much about,” 
Martin said. “You see Tom Miller as 
an artist here, gifted, kooky and cre-ative as hell.”‘Kooky’ artist does

fore the performance, Park advised about 20 
aspiring poets to notice their diction, posture and eye contact when performing.
“When you make an eye connection, it’s al-
ways like a soul connection,” Park instructed. 
“When you’re writing, don’t think about be-ing politically correct.”
“Exhale” is part of a series of events spon-
sored by UF’s Multicultural and Diversity Af-
fairs to promote and celebrate diversity.
“We really do need events like this because 
it helps bring people together,” said Jeff Leon, a UF English senior. “I didn’t know what to expect, but this was just amazing.”At the end of the night, Park returned to 
her hotel before her 3 a.m. flight back to her home in Queens, N.Y. Park enjoys the unpredict-
ability of making a living as a 
poet, she said.
“I enjoy the recklessness of it and never 
knowing what’s going to happen,” Park said. “Sometimes it’s good, and sometimes it ends up hilarious.” 
It cost about $2,500 to bring Park to UF, 
said JR Miller, an emissary at the Institute of 
Black Culture.
The event was also sponsored by the In-
stitute of Black Culture and the Institute of 
Hispanic-Latino Cultures.‘Def Poetry Jam’ poet Ishle Park was paid about $2,500 to perform
most of February and March at the Cheetah Conservation Fund’s facilities, where they helped with the annual examinations of the site’s 47 cheetahs, according to the program’s Web site.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said the 
family has asked UF not to make any com-
ments to the media beyond the content of its 
statement.
 “The family has requested that in lieu of flowers, contributions be sent to the Univer-sity of Florida Foundation, P.O. Box 14425, Gainesville, Florida 32604, designated for the 
Thad H. Owens Wildlife Ecology Fund,” UF’s 
statement reads.
An event at UF to remember Owens is be-ing planned for today, Dippel said.
The event is tentatively scheduled for 4

ATTENDED THE EVENT.

Three thousand nine hundred 
and fifty. That’s how many steps 
Shelley Meyer took at the Ben Hill Griffin Stadium Saturday morning. 
Meyer was one of 67 participants 
of the first “Stomp the Swamp,” an event that helped raise money for UF’s Center for Autism and Related Disabilities. 
Meyer said she participated in 
the event because she wants to help children with autism such as her nephew, Logan.
 She was sponsored by Desert 
Gator Club, a Phoenix-based UF alumni organization.
“Why not get a good workout in 
while helping out a good cause at the same time?” she said. 
As of Saturday afternoon, the 
event raised $1,206 for the center, which provides support, informa-tion and help for autism and other disabilities.
Virginia McMormac, 51, attend-
ed the event with her two autistic sons, Erin and David.  McMormac looked on delight-
fully as David, 15, played basket-ball with Albert, UF’s mascot. 
“I would walk a million miles to 
see that smile,” she said.
McMormac said her family has 
received tremendous support from the center. 
“It is our turn to support them,” 
she said.
Amanda Cruz, coordinator of 
the event and a UF sophomore, 
started planning the event in Octo-
ber. Cruz said one family in particu-
lar made her take action. One of her professors, Bonnie Johnson, has a 
son, David, who was diagnosed 
with autism when he was 1 year old. 
“When I heard his story, it really 
touched my heart,” she said. “I just knew I had to do something.”
Cruz said she plans to put on the 
event again next year.
“We will continue the fight 
against autism, one step at a time,” she said. ‘Stomp the Swamp’ raises $1,206 for autism center

Today’s question: Did you bite off

154 TOTAL VOTESU.S. and Cuba must forge relationshipColumn
Friday’s question: Do you have a pair of lucky underwear?For the past 50 years our country has all but ignored 
Cuba’s existence. We’ve placed a trade embargo on 
the island nation, only harming our own farmers 
and other exporters, and we’ve gone as far to place travel restrictions on the country, punishing Cuban-Americans 
and hindering our travel industry.
But Matt, you say, Cuba is communist!Castro has locked away political prisoners and jour-
nalists, and committed numerous other human rights atrocities.
So has China, but we seem pretty content with not 
only filling our dollar stores with their kitsch but our 
Wal-Marts as well. We’ve even let them buy our treasury 
bonds. A lot of them, too.
It seems that so much of America is still lockstep in 
the late ‘50s and early ‘60s. Many of our schools are still relics of the early Cold War age, and our education sys-
tem hasn’t progressed much further either. 
Likewise, our inane policy toward dealing with Cuba 
is still rooted in the Cold War directives of years past.
The Cold War is over, but we still seem stuck in a 
post-Cold War attitude. Actually, since the end of the Cold War, we’ve seemed stuck in a post-anything atti-
tude. We’ve had post-USSR, post-Waco, post-Whitewa-
ter, post-Lewinsky, post-USS Cole, post-Sept. 11, post-
Katrina, and now with the election of President Barack 
Obama, post-Bush. What first sparked my interest and 
later support in Obama was his promise to bring a new 
sense of purpose and resolve to change the world for the better. 
Republicans, never a sanguine group to start out with, 
labeled Obama as too auspicious, and his followers too naïve.
Obama did have a hard sell, believing that our self-
indulgent and excessive ways could be curved, if only for a year or two to re-establish 
our standing in the world by 
fixing the economic mess our financial hubris wrought. After all, America has always shined 
in moments of great causes, ab-
stemiously shedding our inher-
ent selfishness for the collective 
cause, the American cause.
And then we lose our mo-
mentum. Or, as a Swedish fam-
ily friend recently explained to 
me, Americans seem intent on “surfing and then sleep-ing.” We go all-in at the last possible notice and then 
simply leave. We give weapons to Afghan mujahedeen to fight the Soviets but then forget to build schools and 
clinics in the country, leaving the door open for the Tali-
ban. We resolved ourselves to root out Osama bin Laden 
in the Hindu Kush Mountains but then decided Iraq was 
more important.
We locked Cuba out during the Cold War in an ef-
fort to contain the plague of communism but forgot to let them back in once the Cold War ended, and in effect, 
have still never escaped the Cold War paradigm.
As the Summit of the Americas convenes in the com-
ing weeks, Obama, like his predecessors, will once again 
be confronted with the Cuba question. 
The president should agree to open Cuba back up, if 
not for the thousands of Cuban-Americans who still have family on the island and the economic advantages of a 
new market, then signal America’s new worldview: A nation that isn’t post-anything but before-everything.
If not for those reasons, then certainly for the cigars.Matthew Christ is a political science freshman. His col-
umn appears on Mondays.An inherent struggle exists when sitting down to memori-
alize the life of a semi-famous individual – especially in the wake of tragedy.
The crucial question, constantly resurfacing, begs to ask 
why the media fails to call attention to the innumerable deaths 
of 22-year-olds who are called home far too soon, unless he or 
she is a celebrity. With the death of Anaheim Angels rookie pitcher Nick Adenhart last Wednesday evening came a litany of eulogies and columns expressing sorrow and sympathy for all those who knew the young man. The Editorial Board struggled mightily in deciding whether adding our own commentary was even necessary – leading us to wonder if we would ever hypo-thetically write about an untimely death of a UF student occur-ring during the semester.
The story of Nick Adenhart the baseball player didn’t take 
the familiar path to success as a result of his immense god-given abilities, but rather thanks to a strong sense of resiliency. Dealt the unfortunate hand of Tommy John surgery to his elbow just prior to the draft, the Angels took a risk on the 2004 High School Player of The Year as he faced a long uphill battle in recovery. Due to his feverish work ethic to rehabilitate his arm, Adenhart earned a call-up to the majors last season – making him the youngest pitcher in the league at the time. 
What makes Adenhart special is not simply the fact that he 
was a promising pitcher in Major League Baseball, but rather an individual who exhibited true greatness off the baseball di-amond. Not to say the numerous everyday men and women who succumb to an early death every single day are not worthy of our ink, but much can be learned from Adenhart’s life. The death of someone as remarkable and so full of promise as Ad-enhart leaves even the most apathetic baseball fan begging to question his or her own faith in humankind.
A mere hours before meeting his untimely demise, Aden-
hart pitched the game of his life – a performance that he ex-pected and as a result, invited his father to attend. Thanks to six innings of no-run baseball, the young rookie from Maryland showed his teammates why he deserved a rotation spot on one of the best teams in baseball. While Adenhart was not the win-ning pitcher on Wednesday evening, his ever-so-brief touch with greatness foreshadowed a brilliant career marked with the awards and accolades fit for an ace.
And then it was gone.Beyond all the respectful remarks made about Adenhart’s 
life and career came the raw emotion and genuine love out of the mouth of fellow teammate Dustin Moseley. Through his tears and quivering voice, Moseley paid sincere homage to his friend – a heartfelt press conference shedding light on the im-pact Adenhart had made on his life. Moseley pointed out both fans and players alike were drawn to Adenhart, not just because of outstanding skills as a baseball player but because he was 
such a remarkable person.
Simply put, the effects felt by the Angels pitching staff will 
surely be seen over the course of the season, but the loss of a 
budding leader in the clubhouse will linger on. 
An unfortunate perception of immortality and exclusion 
from the troubles that plague everyday folk continues to exist within the realm of professional sports. Such an ideology is fos-tered not only by the behavior of athletes themselves, but also through fans whose isolated view of stars perpetuates a notion of invincibility. If there is but one good thing to come from the tragic death of Nick Adenhart, we sincerely hope all profession-al athletes learn to realize they do not reside within a bubble.
While the Angels lost a teammate who showed great prom-
ise on the pitching mound, the world said goodbye to a man who brought joy and happiness to all those fortunate enough to have known him.

GmOs represent technology of the future
Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) 
have been an issue for many years relating to 
the question of whether they are safe. I un-derstand the big conflict surrounding this is-sue but do not understand the big deal. 
I believe GMOs are beneficial for our farm-
ers, consumers and future agricultural needs. Major conflicts, such as labeling and safety, have been overlooked and criticized from the inside out.  Labeling has become such a huge issue in the U.S. and Europe, when really it is a minor matter. 
Not labeling GMO products, I think, is 
unnecessary. When a food product or any product is labeled, it usually consists of in-gredients and nutrition facts or facts that re-late to safety such as risk of mouth and lung cancer in tobacco products. In comparison, if GMOs were labeled on a product, many of 
us would think of it as a type of nutrition, or 
seeing what negative feedback it is getting to-day, as a harmful substance and not buy the product.
What I don’t understand is how people 
who buy tobacco products know that they are actually harmful to their health, or drink alcohol knowing that it too, is poisonous to their bodies, can reject something like GMOs, which has not been proven harmful to their health like tobacco and alcohol. 
These little bits and pieces are what peo-ple are not looking at and instead go by what the media is saying. GMOs are the technol-
ogy of the future. They help farmers pro-
duce healthier crops and prevent them from 
suiting up in obnoxious uniforms to spray pesticides. GMOs also have helped undevel-oped countries develop more efficient and 
healthier crops in order to feed their familys 
everyday. 
People need to look deep into the facts be-
fore making a decision on something that, in 
the future, might help bring food to the table-
-no matter who you are.

Tobacco’s history runs deep in Florida
The new tobacco tax that came into effect 
on April 1 is a much larger detriment to our 
society than the tobacco itself.  
The government is placing an even heavi-
er burden on an already highly regulated and taxed industry. President Barack Obama and his socialist associates can say what they want, but it is an all-out attempt to put the American tobacco farmer out of business. We need to remember that tobacco built this na-tion and made America what we are today. 
Furthermore, it played a key role in build-
ing this institution. The University of Florida was once known for having a premier tobac-
co program within its agronomy department. 
This program was created due to the fact that 
there are eight tobacco producing counties in 
the state of Florida, and the quality of tobacco that comes from these areas is second to none 
worldwide; not even the famous North Caro-
lina tobacco, and certainly not anything pro-
duced overseas can even come close. 
I am very proud to say that I come from 
one of these counties and I am a member of 
a family steeped in the tobacco industry.  It 
has provided both my family and many oth-
ers with the means to make a living for many 
generations. After all, it’s not the farmer or the “Big Tobacco” executives making indi-
vidals consume their product. 
It’s a simple matter of personal choice and 
the consumer should not be punished. Espe-
cially not at the hands of another tobacco con-sumer, such as Obama.

Column demonstrates misuse of ‘illegal’
Even though I agree with Johnathan Lott’s 
column about the DREAM Act, I have to dis-pute his use of the term “illegal.” 
Although it was used only once, such a 
term is not completely true when it comes to the DREAM Act, and it allows for a lot of misunderstanding. Call me a stickler against generalization, but that is exactly what hap-
pens by using that term. Not all children that 
would benefit from the DREAM Act come 
from illegal immigrants. 
Being undocumented doesn’t make you 
illegal. Like many immigrants, most of these 
families come to the U.S. legally with visas. 
They legally attempt to get papers, but for 
whatever the reasons, their attempts may fail 
or just take a very long time, making them undocumented, not illegal. 
The term illegal is inclusive of the term 
undocumented but not vice versa. For ex-
ample, a family can come into the U.S. legally 
by plane with visas and apply for documen-tation and permanent residencies.  If rejected, however, then they become undocumented, not illegal. Their struggle for documentation simply continues. 
Don’t be misled by the bad connotation 
the term illegal implies. These kids deserve 
the opportunity at higher education that the 
DREAM Act will be granting, especially since coming to America wasn’t their choice. So, 
embrace the opportunity to make the dreams 
of  thousands of deserving undocumented 
students come true by supporting the pas-
sage of the DREAM Act.

3BALetters to the Editor
The University of Florida is 
getting better and better these days in large part due 
to the increase in the scholastic aptitude of its incoming fresh-
man classes. 
The acceptance rate for my 
class was around 39 percent, and 
this year’s rate will likely be even smaller. For the first time ever, the Honors Program at UF has had twice as many applicants apply and be eligible as there are seats. This increase in the average qual-ity of UF students, while great for the school in general, underlies a tragedy about the state of higher education in the Florida. 
The Sunshine State decided 
long ago that the best way to at-tract people to live here and attain economic growth was to have no income tax and rely on tourism to generate the lion share of neces-sary revenues. The danger is that in economic downturns, such as the one we are experiencing, tour-ism takes huge hits because peo-ple real-ize they’d r a t h e r pay their mortgage 
payments, 
and as a result the state budget 
collapses. Florida has become a victim to its own success with its development strategy. Huge numbers of retirees have moved here, and the low-tax pressures they exert on Florida politics are keeping our state from being the most innovative in the nation.
Job growth and economic in-
novation that result in long-term economic growth are powered by strong universities. Just when UF 
was reaching critical mass to be-
come the next Berkeley, the state pulled the rug out from under us by slashing millions. 
If Florida wants to be anything 
beside the perpetual snowbird nest, it needs to institute a state income tax. It doesn’t have to be steep, just enough where our universities can be adequately funded. Even with such a tax, our state would still be very attrac-tive compared to the frigid high tax environments up north. It is 
time to lose our archaic Mickey 
Mouse tax system. 
State policy-makers either 
need to give UF the funding it needs to succeed, or get out of the way, abolish the Board of Trust-ees, and let us govern ourselves.

ence and economics freshman.

It was a short stay in 
Gainesville for Allan Chaney.
UF coach Billy Donovan re-
leased a statement on Friday an-
nouncing the freshman forward’s decision to transfer from UF.
“Allan, his family and I have 
spoken, and we have mutually decided that he will be transfer-ring from the University of Flor-ida,” Donovan said in the state-ment. “I’ve enjoyed coaching Allan, and I would like to help 
he and his family in any way pos-
sible to ensure the best path for his future.”
Chaney played sparingly dur-
ing the first half of the season and 
missed most of the second half 
with ankle and heel injuries as well as a sprained ligament in his foot. His absence hurt an already-
depleted UF frontcourt.
The 6-foot-8, 231-pound for-
ward was held out of the last two 
games of the National Invitation Tournament and finished the year under suspension for violat-
ing team rules.
Chaney averaged 3 points 
and two rebounds per game this 
season in 23 appearances for the Gators.
In his first college start, Chaney 
scored a career-high 13 points in UF’s 86-84 win against Washing-ton in the consolation game of the 
CBE Classic in Kansas City, Mo., 
in November.
Chaney was rated a four-star 
recruit by Rivals.com when he came out of high school in New 
London, Conn. He has yet to an-
nounce where he will transfer.
UF had been facing a scholar-
ship crunch for next season, but with the departure of Chaney and incoming freshman center DeShawn Painter’s recent re-
lease from his letter of intent, the 
Gators are now one under their NCAA-allotted 13 scholarships.
This marks the fifth time in 
four years that a UF player has 
transferred. 
After the 2005-06 season, then-
freshman guard David Huertas 
transferred to Southeastern Con-
ference-rival Mississippi with a 
national championship under his belt.
After the 2006-07 national title, 
then-freshman Brandon Powell 
parted ways with the Gators and 
moved to Marshall.
When last season came to a 
close, then-sophomore forward 
Jonathan Mitchell left UF to play 
at Rutgers.
Sophomore point guard Jai 
Lucas also left the Gators for Tex-as before the first regular-season 
game of this season.

The Gators picked up their 10th oral commitment of the 
2010 recruiting class Friday, adding to the quick start the team 
has already made toward building next year’s class.
Jaylen Watkins, an athlete from Cape Coral High, com-
mitted while at a UF spring football practice. Watkins was 
impressed by UF on many levels — namely the team’s recent 
on-field success and the school’s academic opportunities — but the coaches impressed him most.
“When I went there, the coaches were real. It didn’t feel like 
they were recruiting,” Watkins said.
Offensive coordinator Steve Addazio was in charge of Wat-
kins’ recruitment. 
Watkins said other schools watched his game tape and 
called Cape Coral coach Mike Goebbel to say they were offer-
ing Watkins scholarships without ever meeting him. Addazio’s 
approach was more personal.
“(Addazio) told me they didn’t just recruit any guy, that 
it was going to be a long process, and it was,” Watkins said. “They wanted to have a great relationship before offering.”
Watkins has Swiss Army Knife versatility, having lined up 
at quarterback, wideout, safety, cornerback and kick returner for Cape Coral. He said the Gators are recruiting him at corner-back, making him the team’s fifth defensive back commit.
While a lot of recruits visit Gainesville 
frequently during the team’s spring season, Friday was the first time Watkins had been to a Gators practice. He said he wanted to stay in town longer, but his grandfather Sam Watkins, a reverend at Zion Hope Mission-
ary Baptist Church and Cape Coral’s team 
chaplain, wanted to get home to prepare for Easter.
His grandfather also accompanied 
Watkins on his first trips to The Swamp last year during UF’s games against Miami and LSU. They were blown away by the stadium’s atmosphere. 
“That is one of the craziest places I’ve ever been to,” Wat-
kins said. “My granddad and dad loved it.”
Weighing only 172 pounds and running a 4.44-second 40-
yard dash, Watkins is cut in the mold of an agile playmaker who jukes around defenders. But a look at Watkins’ highlight tape shatters that stereotype. Watkins loves contact. At safety, he lights up opposing receivers. On one kick return, he broke two tackles simultaneously en route to a 90-yard touchdown.
“I don’t know how others see me, but around my county 
I’m known as a physical player,” he said.
Watkins chose to end his recruiting process early so he can 
focus on his senior year at Cape Coral. He hopes his early com-mitment will keep other coaches — and other distractions — away from his team’s practices so he can concentrate on win-ning the Class 5A state championship.
In last year’s playoffs, Cape Coral fell to Venice Beach 35-14. 
Venice Beach won on the legs of fellow UF commit Trey Bur-ton, who rushed for five touchdowns.
Burton has been in contact with virtually every player tar-
geted by UF in the 2010 recruiting class, including Watkins. The two have developed an on-field rivalry and talk frequently.
“I was actually a silent commit on March 30, but I told Trey 
about it,” Watkins said. “Me and Trey are real cool.”
Oral commitments are non-binding until a national letter of in-
tent is signed on National Signing Day on Feb. 3, 2010.UF FOOTBALL

Perhaps the Gators were too 
patient in waiting until their third 
conference road matchup to secure a series win, but that virtue proved 
useful in the batter’s box Sunday. 
After suffering through difficult 
losses at Arkansas and Vanderbilt, 
UF (23-12, 9-6 Southeastern Con-ference) patiently drew 11 walks 
in a 5-1 win at Auburn (23-12, 7-8 
SEC) to take the weekend series 
2-1.
“As you go deeper in the sea-
son, you never know which (loss) 
you are going to look back at and 
wish you had got it done,” UF 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “Go-ing on the road this weekend and 
beating a good Auburn team was 
big for us.”
The Gators capitalized on the 
Tigers’ wild pitching, as three bat-ters who reached base on walks wound up scoring.
The biggest benefactor of the 
free passes was Mike Mooney, who walked three times in four plate appearances and scored twice.
As UF hitters walked around the 
bases, the team’s pitchers forced Auburn’s batters to put the ball in play to get on base. The Gators’ two pitchers, Anthony DeSclafani and Alex Panteliodis, didn’t give up any walks.
DeSclafani started for the first 
time in a weekend series and al-lowed just 1 run over 6 1/3 innings, 
giving up four hits while striking 
out six batters. The two freshman hurlers limited Auburn — the SEC home-run leader — by mixing up their pitches and using the inside 
of the plate.
“They both 
did a really nice job of command-ing the ball in,” O’Sullivan said. “It’s one thing to just pitch in, but you got to pitch 
in and locate it. Both guys were able to do it.”
The Gators’ weekend didn’t get 
off to a good start, though. 
They were up 5-1 on Friday night before the game was sus-
pended because of a tornado 
warning. It appeared the Gators would cruise to victory when the game resumed Saturday, as they padded their lead to 7-1 heading into the bottom of the sixth. But Auburn bounced back quickly, plating 6 runs over its next four in-nings to send the game into extra innings. In the 11th, Auburn’s Jo-seph Sanders hit his second homer of the game, ending the 8-7 contest in walk-off fashion.
UF must have been preserving 
its bats for the second game of the doubleheader. Led by Josh Adams, the Gators’ offense exploded with a 24-2 victory. Adams finished the night 5 for 6 with 4 runs, two hom-ers and six RBIs.
The bats cooled off Sunday. 
Only four players got hits for the Gators, and Daniel Pigott was the only UF player to finish with a multi-hit game. Due to the 11 walks and two Tigers errors, every Gator except Avery Barnes reached base.
Pigott sent a 2-run homer to left 
field in the top of the eighth for his second hit of the game, giving the Gators a big cushion.
“I know the 2 runs in the eighth 
didn’t make the difference in the ballgame, but they certainly gave us some breathing room,” O’Sullivan said. “It’s good to see Daniel swinging the bat well.”

this report.

■ THE VOLLEYBALL TEAM PLAYED SIX MATCHES ON SATURDAY.

It may only be spring, and the UF volley-
ball team’s season is months away. But win-
ning still feels good, especially against a rival.
The team went 6-0 against in-state rivals 
FSU, Miami and Florida International in its spring session at Florida Gym.
“Whenever they’re keeping score, you 
want to win,” freshman Kelly Murphy said. “There’s a reason there’s a scoreboard.”The six matches were considerably more 
than the two matches per weekend the team is used to playing.
“It’s a little exhausting,” Elyse Cusack said. 
“This is a lot different, but I thought we did a 
great job. It was a great experience for us.”
Although spring matches don’t carry any 
weight come fall, UF coach Mary Wise said it’s 
an opportunity for the team to see progress in areas it has focused on during the off-season.
“We have spent a lot of energy this spring 
on point-scoring, serving aces, kills and block-
ing,” Wise said. “We’re a much better blocking 
team than we were in the fall.” 
Wise said blocking comes with experience, 
something her team lacked in the fall when it had seven freshmen and three sophomores.
The Gators started off in the morning, win-
ning in straight sets against the Golden Pan-thers (25-21, 27-25). They moved on to their next opponent, the Seminoles, and beat them 
in three sets, dropping the first set 21-25 before reeling off the next two sets 25-21, 15-10.
UF finished its first round 
of matches against Miami and won in straight sets 
(25-23, 25-22). In the second round, the Gators played the Hurricanes again. It took three sets, but the end result was the same — another UF win (25-17, 25-17, 13-15).UF played FIU and swept the Golden Pan-
thers a second time before playing its most contested match against FSU to end the tour-nament. Much like their first matchup of the day, UF came out on top in the second and 
third sets (23-25, 25-23, 16-14).
“It’s nice to see the other competition,” 
sophomore Lauren Bledsoe said. “To see if 
we’ve improved as a team, to see if everything that we’ve been working on is the right thing to be working on.”
Wise said the session helped simulate com-
petition that can’t be created in practice.
“You try and simulate drills like that, but 
it’s not the same,” Wise said. “All of those ex-periences (Saturday) will help us in the fall.” Spring scrimmages give UF chance to show improvement

The Gators went nine innings 
before scoring a run in their first 
game Saturday. In the first in-
ning of their next game, Franc-
esca Enea put 2 runs on the board with one swing.
Enea homered twice, break-
ing the school career home-run record, and No. 1 UF (42-3, 20-1 Southeastern Conference) swept its doubleheader against Ken-tucky (25-16, 8-11 SEC) in Lex-
ington, Ky.
After hitting the 36th and 37th 
home runs of her career in Game 
2, Enea was predictably humble 
about shattering the school re-
cord — previously held by Lind-sey Cameron — in just two and a half years at UF. 
“I’m really excited I got to 
do that, but it’s not that big of a deal,” Enea said.
The junior left fielder’s two-
home-run performance in Game 
2 was a drastic change from the 
way UF struggled at the plate in Game 1. 
Wildcats pitcher Rachel Ri-
ley threw a nine-inning, one-hit 
game, holding the Gators with-
out a hit through eight innings.
Ali Gardiner recorded the 
only hit off Riley in the top of the ninth, and right fielder Kelsey Bruder’s sacrifice fly drove home pinch runner Le-Net Franklin for the deciding run.
“We just kept hitting ground-
er after grounder after grounder, and I think the first fly ball in the air was Kelsey’s,” Enea said. “It 
was so big for Kelsey to make the 
adjustment and get the run for us.”
Senior pitcher Stacey Nelson 
(25-3, 0.45 ERA) shut out Ken-
tucky in UF’s 1-0 victory, striking 
out 12 batters. Nelson gave up five hits but pitched out of sever-al situations where Kentucky had 
runners in scoring position.
“When I saw how good their 
pitcher was do-
ing, I knew that 
I needed to pitch 
a shutout, or else 
we might not get away from that game with 
a win,” Nelson 
said.
Sophomore Stephanie Brom-
bacher (17-0, 0.96 ERA) followed Nelson’s performance with a 
12-strikeout game of her own in 
the second half of the double-header. Brombacher gave up only three hits and walked no batters 
in UF’s 6-0 win.
Brombacher had a more pro-
ductive Gators offense to back 
her up in Game 2. Led by Enea’s first-inning home run to left field, UF jumped out to an early lead 
and never looked back. Enea 
added the record-breaking home run, her 14th of the season, in the fifth inning. 
“We were all just a little frus-
trated with our swings and won-dering why we weren’t getting 
our hits, so I think going in to the 
second game, we just wanted to put the first game behind us and do what we know how to do and 
play the way we know how to play,” Enea said.
UF and Kentucky were origi-
nally slated to play a three-game 
series, starting with a Friday 
doubleheader and a single game 
on Saturday, but rain forced the switch to a doubleheader Satur-day.
The weather may have caused an unexpected change in plans Friday, but it also made the Gators more eager to get on the field.
“We were kind of antsy be-
cause we’d been sitting in a hotel the whole day before, so we were ready to go out and play,” Nel-
son said.Enea breaks home-run record in doubleheader sweep16, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, APRIL 13, 2009
