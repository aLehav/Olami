With an electric fan at his feet, Charlie Crist addressed his 
Gators fans in Pugh Hall on Wednesday.   
The former Florida governor discussed the importance of 
early voting and his support for the environment, medical mari-
juana and women’s rights.   
“Florida is one of the most diverse states in the country, and 
that fundamental fairness is something that we need to ﬁ  ght 
for,” Crist said.
Students from UF College Democrats passed out stickers 
that read “Gators for Crist” to people at the event.
Several UF students went to see Crist, including 21-year-old 
Helen Roldan, who said she is a big supporter of Crist and heard 
from a classmate that he would be at Pugh Hall. She decided to stop by after class and support him.
“I really enjoy his debates, and I wanted to see him in person, 
especially if he is going to be our governor again,” the UF politi-cal science senior said.
Crist said he plans on restoring cuts made to Bright Futures 
by Gov. Rick Scott and providing low interest rates to college students with loans.
Early voting for the 2014 general election started Oct. 22 and 
ends Saturday. The general election will take place Tuesday.Crist speaks to

A Gainesville woman was ar-
rested Tuesday night after police 
said she smashed three glass jew-elry cases with an aluminum bat at the Southwest Archer Road Wal-
Mart.
Shortly be-
fore 10 p.m., 28-year-old Vanna Crawford calmly walked into the store with a met-
al bat, according to a report. She 
then headed to 
the jewelry section and proceeded 
to obliterate three glass cases, caus-ing about $4,000 in damage.
Other than giving her name to 
ofﬁ  cers, Crawford — who is a reg-istered nurse at Parklands Rehabili-tation and Nursing Center at 1000 
SW 16th Ave. — remained silent, a 
report said.
“She was Baker Acted in May of 
this year for a mental break, and it seems like she obviously suffered another,” Gainesville Police spokes-man Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias wrote in an email. He said he “can’t recall in recent memory an incident like this 
one.”
The Baker Act was created in 
1971 and allows judges, law enforce-
ment ofﬁ  cers and mental health professionals to request a hold on someone for examination if they are believed to be at risk to themselves or others.
Management at the Southwest 
Archer Road Wal-Mart declined to comment on the incident.
Crawford was arrested on charg-
es of criminal mischief. Her bond is set at $10,000.Police: Woman damages

Starting Monday, students at Norton Elemen-
tary will be the ﬁ  rst in Alachua County to eat 
breakfast, lunch and dinner in their school caf-eteria.
Norton will make warm and cold dinners 
available for students in the after-school edu-cation program, a project funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and paid for by the Child Care Food Program, a Florida Department of Health initiative.
As the pilot school in the program, Norton 
was chosen because of its high percentage of stu-dents who receive free or reduced lunch — 55 percent of the school’s about 600 students — said 
Caron Rowe, a food and nutrition specialist for 
Alachua County Public Schools.
The school also boasts one of the largest after-
school programs in the county with 162 students enrolled and an average of 150 students staying after school each day, Rowe said.
Alachua County Public Schools has been look-
ing to implement the program since the summer as a way to supplement the county’s free and re-duced school breakfast and lunch options.
“We thought, ‘Hey, what a great opportunity 
to offer supper here,’ because we do ﬁ  nd that there is a need for it just because of the homeless statistics we have from the county,” Rowe said.
Although about 6 percent of families living 
in the school’s 32605 ZIP code are below the 
poverty line, its 2200 NW 45th Ave. address 
performs well compared to other county zones. According to Zip Atlas, the highest Gainesville poverty zones include 32641 with 29.15 percent of families, 32603 with 21.88 percent and 32601 with 20.73 percent.
Rowe said Norton qualiﬁ  ed under the Child 
Care Food Program because it services a large enough student population with free and re-
duced lunch.
The new dinner meals will meet nutrition 
department requirements, providing meat, 
vegetable, fruit, grain and dairy.  A selection of cold items — like ham and cheese wraps, grilled cheese sandwiches and tuna salad sandwiches — will be interchanged with warm meals, such as chicken tenders, ham-and-broccoli pasta and spaghetti with meat sauce.Norton Elementary chosen as

A local bookstore’s legal sta-
tus will change this semester after 
years of battling the book industry and dealing with debt.
The owners of Wild Iris Books, 
a feminist bookstore that has been around for more than 20 years, are pursuing a nonprofit status in order to keep the store open. The change will allow its owners to apply for grant money, as well as provide more opportunities for employees to spread its message of activism and empowerment.
Wild Iris, located at 22 SE Fifth 
Ave., is one of only a dozen femi-nist bookstores in the U.S. and the last one open in Florida, said Erica Merrell, one of the store’s owners.
Due to the changing landscape 
of the book industry, including the advancement of online media and electronic books, it is becoming in-
creasingly difficult for the store to 
continue to operate on sales alone.
“Books are never going to make 
us enough money,” she said.
With monthly costs of just more 
than $1,500, Wild Iris has to sell about $4,000 in books a month to stay afloat, according to an online campaign the Wild Iris team host-
ed from July to September.
The online Indiegogo campaign, 
called “Wild Iris Books — Help Us 
Fund our Feminist Future,” at-tempted to raise $15,000 to allevi-ate some of the debt the store has accrued, which is between $17,000 to $20,000, Merrell said.
The campaign ended on Sept. 2 
and raised $3,719 — 25 percent of its goal, which Merrell said has al-ready been a huge help.
The ability for owners to get 
different types of funding such as grants and donations is the biggest benefit of the transition from retail to nonprofit, Merrell said.
“You wouldn’t donate money 
to Publix, or you wouldn’t donate money to Barnes & Noble,” she said.
Switching from a retail business 
to a nonprofit will also include a number of changes to the structure of Wild Iris, including dissolving Merrell and Cheryl Calhoun’s co-
ownership and replacing it with a 
board of community members. But the shop will keep selling books.
“I thought it would be more bit-
tersweet,” Merrell said. “But I’m really excited. I can’t wait for ev-erything to be finalized.”
The store currently operates on 
a volunteer basis, and owners and 
staff receive no compensation for 
the time and effort they put into running the store.
Some of the funding Wild Iris could receive from its transition to nonprofit would go toward staff 
salaries, Merrell said.
Shirley Roseman, a UF psy-
chology and sociology senior who 
volunteered at Wild Iris in the past and is currently an intern, said she looks forward to the change.
“There’s so much more that we 
could be doing for the communi-ty,” the 25-year-old said.
Roseman said she hopes Wild 
Iris will be able to expand some of its current programs, including its monthly Feminist Open Mic Night, a book club, the Feminist Meditation Group and various partnerships with Gainesville and Alachua County civil service orga-nizations like Books for Prisoners 
and Alachua County Victim Ser-
vices and Rape Crisis Center.
“It would create so much 
change and give us so much free-dom,” she said.
The first part of the process, 
which includes petitioning the court to convert the store’s legal status, has already been completed, 
Merrell said. Further procedures 
include paying a filing fee for a new federal ID number.
Wild Iris’ lawyer, Adam Roark, 
who is aiding in the transition, was unavailable to comment.
“My understanding is that it 
shouldn’t be difficult for us to fin-ish up these final parts,” Merrell 
said. “Minus whatever exorbitant 
fee there is.”

UF undergraduates applying 
to law schools made up the larg-
est pool of applicants in the coun-try last year. But not all of those applicants decided to apply to the 
UF Levin College of Law.
“Overall, our applications 
were down last year and the same 
as most of the law schools (in the country),” said George Dawson, Levin College of Law interim dean.
A survey released by Kaplan 
Test Prep showed that law school 
admissions officers are optimistic 
about increasing applicants de-spite low statistics.
“I think that, probably, law 
schools as a whole nationally have significantly decreased, and a lot of the seats have been eliminated because there are not enough ap-plicants,” Dawson said.
Jeff Thomas, executive director 
of pre-law programs for Kaplan Test Prep, said the number of ap-plications to law school is closely related to the economy.“When the economy is not 
doing so well, the number of stu-dents who go to law school tends to increase,” Thomas said.
For the past five years, ap-
plications have declined, forcing law schools to either take fewer students or students who are less qualified to fill seats, he said.
UF’s law school has decreased 
its graduating class size, Dawson said, and fewer students took the LSAT in September. Dawson said it is possible for the number of ap-plicants to increase in the coming years, but he doesn’t expect it to happen this year.
The large number of UF under-
graduates applying to law schools accounts for the university’s over-all size and strong undergraduate programs, Thomas said.
“There are many colleges in 
the country that don’t have pre-law classes,” he said.
UF offers pre-law academic 
advising and provides a list of 
courses and majors to prepare 
students for law school.
“Just because the number of 
applicants has decreased, that does not mean that it is necessar-ily easier to get into law school,” Thomas said.US law colleges see  
applications slump
“It would create so much 
change and give us so 
much freedom.”

Safety barriers cover manholes emitting hot steam on the sidewalk along Stadium 
Road. 
� IT IS ONLY A PRECAUTION.

Alligator staff writer afigueroa@alligator.org
Four manholes off Stadium Road have 
been barricaded and labeled with warning 
signs to protect students and faculty from 
hot steam.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said in 
some cases, the steam can make the man-
hole covers hot. 
No one has been hurt, but the steam 
could potentially burn someone passing by.
Sikes said UF is working on developing 
solutions to the manhole covers.
“One consideration is to add a different 
kind of manhole cover that resists heat,” Sikes wrote in an email.
UF has many underground utility sys-
tems such as electricity, chilled water and steam that help provide power, heating and cooling to buildings, Jeff Chorlog, vice 
president of UF’s Physical Plant Division, 
wrote in an email.
“As is typical with this type of system 
minor leaks occur or groundwater may 
seep into the bottom and be heated on con-
tact with the actual steam piping,” Chor-log said.
As a temporary solution, UF has placed 
barricades and signs to warn people.
“As we seek a better solution to the four 
hot manhole lids, we felt it was prudent to provide these safeguards to the campus community,” Chorlog said.Manholes around campus

With a few clicks, UF students ordering textbooks on 
Amazon.com can now donate money to a local charity at 
no extra cost.
Friends of the Crisis Center will receive 0.5 percent of 
every purchase made when an Amazon user buys an item through AmazonSmile and selects the organization as their charity of choice. Amazon users can choose the organiza-
tion for as long as AmazonSmile is available.
“For us, every little bit helps,” said Wendy Brant, Friends 
of the Crisis Center president. “Even if it’s a quarter.”
Friends of the Crisis Center is a nonprofit organization 
that helps fund and support the programs and volunteers of the Alachua County Crisis Center. The money made 
from AmazonSmile will go toward outreach programs, volunteer training and travel expenses to send volunteers to conferences, Brant said.
Brant said AmazonSmile accepted her organization 
about six weeks ago. She got the idea to apply after an AmazonSmile option appeared when she was ordering on the site.
Now, she’s encouraging as many people as possible to 
utilize the program.
“The Crisis Center is so important for the community, 
and not a lot of people know about the center or the servic-
es available,” Brant said. “So it’s also about raising aware-
ness.”
Hailey McComb, a UF psychology sophomore, said 
she’s never heard of the Alachua County Crisis Center.
“If I knew more about the center and was more in-
formed, I would definitely help out,” the 19-year-old said.
Every year, about 180 trained volunteers provide more 
than 40,000 hours of community service in crisis and sui-cide intervention at the Alachua County Crisis Center, which operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.Students can give

Playing the game comes with 
more than just the score. For athletes, 
it can come with a lifetime of reper-cussions.   
A UF study released Tuesday 
shows that UF Health Shands Hos-
pital researchers are using football 
players’ helmets to help measure the 
force of collisions on players.
Dr. James Clugston, a University 
Athletic Association team physician, said despite the awareness about 
concussions, there was very little 
scientific knowledge about them and 
no effective way to diagnose them.
“It came about as a way to take 
better care of our athletes,” he said. “There were a fair amount of concus-sions as a common injury.”
Clugston is leading the research 
on the Head Impact Telemetry Sys-
tem (HITS), which involves technol-
ogy inside helmets that measure the impact, time and location of each hit 
athletes experience.
The technology inside the helmet 
relays data back to Clugston’s re-
search team.Research began in August dur-
ing the current football season, ac-cording to a press release. About 20 
football players are participating in 
the study.
The $574,910 research project is 
being financed by Banyan Biomark-ers and the Florida High Tech Cor-
ridor Council.
Clugston has worked as the UF 
football team doctor for the last 10 
years. He said he has seen concus-
sion cases from multiple sports.
“Having a good technique in your 
sport, being aware of your surround-ings and minimizing the blood to the 
head usually help in concussion pre-
vention,” he said.
The American Journal of Sports 
Medicine also published findings Oct. 21 suggesting dozens of univer-
sities may not follow a concussion 
policy created by the National Col-
legiate Athletic Association.The NCAA created a policy that 
requires institutions of higher learn-ing to have a “concussion-manage-
ment plan,” as well as a process for 
teaching athletes about head inju-ries.
UF has its own concussion-
management plan, which requires a 
player to undergo repeat evaluations 
after initial checkups within 24 to 72 
hours of injury.
According to the management 
plan, a player may only be allowed to return to play after a detailed 
evaluation and completion of the UF 
Return to Play Protocol.
Athletes are given a handout be-
fore playing for a UF sports team, 
providing the definition, symptoms 
and medical importance of a concus-
sion.
Megan Diaz, a UF education 
sophomore, said many of her friends 
suffered concussions playing foot-
ball in high school.
“Sometimes, they’d get hit in the 
head by a ball or another player and not place much importance in it,” 
the 19-year-old said. “But, it’s actu-
ally really serious because you never 
know what a concussion can do to 
your health and playing ability.”UF publishes concussion research
Dinner is for the after-school program
Rowe said students can opt out of the meals, and as 
the program progresses, she expects to gauge demand 
and avoid being wasteful.
Marie Broling, whose fifth-grade daughter, Anna, 
attends Norton, said the program seems like a good 
way to alleviate concerns for parents who may have 
trouble balancing late hours with preparing meals, but she warned of wastefulness.
“Anytime you can help out people less fortunate in 
these ways, I think it’s a great idea, and I hope it’s suc-cessful,” Broling said. “You just don’t want to discard food.”
As the project takes off in Norton, Rowe said the 
county will explore taking it to other schools.
Outside Norton on Wednesday afternoon, parents 
expressed excitement over the additional help the pro-gram can provide for families.
One parent, Jasmin Calhoun, said she has left her daughter, 6-year-old Chanel, in after-school care vari-
ous times and found that students are often hungry by 
the time they leave school.
The dinner program will supplement the snacks 
students already receive in after-school care, which are paid for by the after-school care program.
“This will relieve their budget as well because it 
will be something that is funded through the state,” Rowe said.
Anna Sallet, parent of Norton students 7-year-old 
Naomi and 12-year-old Quincey, has her children on 
the waiting list for after-school care.
News of the dinner program sparked her interest 
even more, she said.
It will be especially beneficial for single parents, she 
said, who have to juggle work, meals and help with 
homework after school.
“It’s really exciting to hear that Norton is the first 
school in Alachua County,” Sallet said. “I love it.”School , from page 1UF RESEAR ch

An apartment complex with a rooftop pool, 
two 24-hour gyms and four clubhouses only 
28 steps from campus? Yes. It’s coming Aug. 14 of next year.
Social 28 is currently under construction 
but has officially started leasing for next Fall. Located at 311 SW 13th St., the complex is made up of two six-story buildings that will top soon-to-be restaurants and markets on the ground level, said leasing manager Alexander Powell.
Four-bedroom, three-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments will be available.
“Social 28 is going to be a game changer 
when it comes to student housing,” Powell 
said. “Our biggest thing is that we want to 
do something that a lot of other communities don’t do.”
Prices range from $789 to $920 per person 
for regular floorplans and $880 to $1100 per person for penthouse apartments. Each will be fully furnished including utilities, cable and Internet.
The complex will also feature study rooms, 
additional multi-purpose rooms, rooftop ter-races with outdoor showers and an oasis cen-ter with outdoor grills.Social 28 was designed with safety in mind, 
said marketing assistant Alyssa Baron.
“There’s going to be a doorman,” Baron 
said. “There’s going to be 24-hour security.”
Powell said only residents and guests will 
be admitted into the building.
“We want to make sure you are secure 
within your facility,” he said.And although safety is the complex’s No.1 
priority, Powell said increasing student expe-riences is also important.
Powell said if at least 13 members of a fra-
ternity, sorority or other organization sign leases, Social 28 will let the group brand its hallway with their crest or symbol, which the complex will provide.
“We want it to be a great experience within 
reason,” he said. “If that means that we need to work with them for their socials and their events, those are usually things that are a part 
of college. And, I mean, we’re Social 28, so we 
have to make sure our residents are social.” New apartment complex off 13th to be completed next fall

Pulitzer Prize-winning 
journalist and author Hedrick 
Smith stopped by Pugh Hall on Wednesday night to talk about the state of America.
During his presentation, 
Smith advocated for people to get involved in social and po-litical changes in America.
He also presented his ideas 
about how to fix the problems 
of income inequality and par-
tisan gridlock. The solution to these issues, Smith said, is for the citizens to take action.  
When the middle class 
makes more money, there is higher demand, which creates more growth, he said.
“We’re pursuing an eco-
nomic strategy today that is not only hurting the middle class — 70 to 80 percent of Americans — but it’s hurting the whole economy,” Smith said.  
Throughout his speech, he 
suggested Americans need to 
invest in young people and 
make college education more affordable for students.
After the presentation, the 
audience could ask questions, and Smith took time to sign copies of his book.
David Bell, a political sci-
ence graduate student, attend-ed Smith’s presentation to have a book signed for a friend.  He said he was not familiar with 
Smith’s work as a journalist or 
author prior to the event.  
Bell, 25, said Smith’s com-
ments were insightful, and he is interested in reading more of Smith’s work.
At the end of the night, he

22, formed the UF 3-gun shooting team 
within the existing pistol team in June.
3-gun shooting is a team competition 
similar to pistol competitions, except it in-volves three types of firearms: a pistol, a shotgun and a rifle. The score in the time-based competition is determined by speed.
Doss, an applied physiology and kine-
siology fifth-year senior, said he enjoyed shooting 3-gun when he first began in Feb-ruary, but there wasn’t a place for it at the 
collegiate level.
Positive feedback from the pistol team 
led him to reach out to sponsors and put 
together a 3-gun team.
He came across Leupold in August, a 
fifth-generation, family-owned company based in Oregon. The company is the dominant manufacturer of optical outdoor sporting accessories in the world and offi-cial sponsor of the 3-Gun Nation Tour, said 
Shane Meisel, Leupold trade marketing 
manager.
“We thought it was a very exciting idea,” 
Meisel said. “We love to see the growth in the shooting sports, especially at the colle-giate level.”
Leupold sponsorship includes the dona-
tion of five VX-6 Multigun Scopes, which are designed specifically for a 3-gun shoot-
ing event, Meisel said. The lightweight 
scope adjusts magnification quickly and has a special eyepiece that will help a shooter engage a target at both short and medium distances. They retail at $800 each.
Doss said he reached out to sponsors to 
make the team accessible to college students on a budget.
“I wanted to reach out to acquire prod-
ucts for the team so anyone can come out and join, even if you don’t have the thou-
sands of dollars worth of equipment,” he 
said.New UF pistol team aims to

Suspicious activity at UF has led to 
changes around campus, including the re-
moval of vegetation.
Alyssa Cho, a UF agronomy graduate 
student who teaches two courses in Mc-
Carty Hall B, said she witnessed workers 
removing vegetation around the hall after a sexual assault in the area.
“I noticed it right away, but then it be-
came extreme,” Cho said. “I could hear it when I was teaching.”
In August, a female UF student was 
grabbed by a man when she was walking 
between McCarty Hall buildings B and C at 
night.
As a plant scientist, Cho was determined 
to find out why UF decided to take away the surrounding plants. She emailed the Sus-tainability and Energy Integration depart-ment for an answer. “In response to the assaults this semes-
ter, there has been a large concern from the campus community about the understory vegetation and the tree canopies around lights,” the office’s director, Matthew Wil-liams, wrote in an email to Cho. “Physical Plant has been charged by upper adminis-
tration with clearing it to help allay the con-
cerns.”
University Police spokesman Maj. Brad 
Barber wrote in an email that he is unaware 
of the reasoning behind this particular case and does not know if the sexual assaults have anything to do with it.
“Regardless, I am aware that there have 
been numerous locations around campus where vegetation was cut back to allow for greater lighting and this could be one of 
those locations,” Barber said.
Cho said cutting plants isn’t enough to 
make campus a safer learning environment.
“It seems a little strange,” Cho said. “I 
think it’s an irrational response.”Campus assaults prompt 
removal of vegetation by UF“Social 28 is going to be a game 
changer when it comes to student 
housing.”

Monday night, a number of UF students, myself in-
cluded, had the pleasure of hearing former White House press secretary Jay Carney speak at the Uni-
versity Auditorium.
Carney shared his multitude of enlightening experienc-
es from his work as a journalist, covering the fall of Com-munism in Moscow and emotionally trying events like the Newtown shooting. As the second White House press secre-tary recruited from the world of journalism since Watergate, Carney entered his position with high expectations to fulﬁ  ll.
Like his former boss, Carney has a reputation for even-
handedness, keeping cool and collected in some of the most challenging moments of recent years. Carney’s most potent piece of advice was to keep free from cynicism.
“Cynicism is a cop-out,” Carney said, before going on to 
tell inspiring stories of moments that contradicted the per-ception that everyone in Washington, or at least the White House, is there for no reason other than blind ambition. The most lurid example he gave was of a time President Barack Obama reminded weary staffers that their jobs were grueling but that they were also at the point where they could do the greatest good for the greatest number of people.
For a while, it was downright peachy. Then it was time 
for questions — when things became decidedly less peachy.Not that anyone, least of all Carney, got angry or combative. Quite the contrary; the discussion remained civil at all times.
Certainly part of this was because of the Accent Speak-
er’s Bureau policy regarding questions — one per person. However, the discussion was fairly unproductive in large part due to Carney’s impressive ability in using wordplay to dance around and deﬂ  ect controversial questions. This kept the crowd’s collective feathers unrufﬂ  ed, a smart move on 
his part. While he has his own reputation to worry about, his 
six months out of ofﬁ  ce haven’t put quite enough distance between him and the administration just yet. In many ways, his actions still speak for the White House.
This was all too obvious in his responses to questions 
about the Edward Snowden leaks and from each side of the Israel/Palestine debate. They were the same responses he would have given if he were press secretary. Saying Snowden should place his conﬁ  dence in our justice system while making a dig at Russia, delicately tailoring his responses to Israel/Palestine ques-tions to the positions of the askers, 
while reminding everyone that the 
U.S. can’t do anything before both sides agree.
Throughout this spectacle, I 
found it difﬁ  cult to escape the suf-
focating irony. A man who still toes the White House line six months after leaving ofﬁ  ce is brought here by an organiza-tion dominated by a single fraternity and tells us not to be cynical. Pray tell, what reason do we have not to be cynical?
The airwaves are clogged with fear-mongering headlines 
about Ebola and the Islamic State, leading us directly into Iraq War III. Meanwhile, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, a man who has been dropping barrels full of explosives on his own people, gets a pass because he doesn’t yell “Allahu Akbar!” when he does it. Washington, D.C. is engaged in a petty war of attrition as ofﬁ  cials protect the interests of those who, thanks to Citizens United, donated money to their suc-cessful campaigns. Locally, we’re about to elect our next gov-
ernor in a contentious race. One candidate is a Republican 
who invoked the Fifth Amendment 75 times in an insurance fraud deposition. Not even the president himself is safe. The hope and idealism of his 2008 campaign seems completely naive in retrospect, having been reduced to a punchline by our political reality following his inauguration.
But we shouldn’t let cynicism lead us to the point of ap-
athy. Although it can help keep us from getting duped by the guile of those who seek and maintain their own power, 
rampant cynicism can be just as pernicious. In this respect, 
Carney was right. We’re fortunate enough to have a margin of choice insofar as who among a pack of ambitious political animals sits in a public ofﬁ  ce. Every so often, we may even be lucky enough to elect somebody who truly has our best interests at heart.

Amendments 
1 and 2
In addition to all the races for elected ofﬁ  ce on the Florida 
ballot this November, voters will also decide whether to ap-prove three amendments to the state Constitution. Each of 
these amendments requires the approval of 60 percent of voters 
to be added.
Amendment 1 would provide a permanent revenue stream 
for the state’s Land Acquisition Trust Fund. The purpose of the 
fund is to expand environmental conservation and wildlife pres-ervation efforts in forests, wetlands and other at-risk areas. 
Gov. Rick Scott and the Florida Legislature have been all too 
eager to slash the budget of the Florida Department of Environ-mental Protection. From 2011 to 2013, Tallahassee lawmakers enacted harsh budget cuts to the department. Legislators re-stored some funding to save political face before the election, but 
Florida’s environmental programs are still underfunded. 
Amendment 1 would ensure that environmental protection 
is not simply left up to the whims of the Legislature. The Alliga-
tor recommends a vote of Yes on Amendment 1. 
Without question, Amendment 2 has received the most at-
tention from both the media and ordinary citizens. This amend-ment would legalize the use of medical marijuana in Florida. 
Some opponents of the measure have expressed concerns 
about the potential for abuse of the drug if it were legalized. 
However, the amendment is carefully written to ensure that 
marijuana would be prescribed for only “debilitating medical condition(s)” such as cancer, AIDS or multiple sclerosis.
Scott has already signed a law allowing for limited use of 
marijuana for those suffering from conditions that cause sei-zures or spasms, such as epilepsy. The full legalization of medi-cal marijuana for legitimate purposes is the logical next step.
The Florida Department of Health would have full regula-
tory power over the use and distribution of medical marijuana. 
Although a few cases of abuse may slip through the cracks, the 
beneﬁ  ts of relieving the pain of these horrible diseases far out-weigh these minor costs. The Alligator recommends a vote of Yes on Amendment 2.
The third and ﬁ  nal amendment on the ballot this year may 
seem arcane and irrelevant to most Floridians. However, Amend-ment 3 could have a signiﬁ  cant and harmful effect on our state’s judicial system if it is approved. Through a variety of changes to the judge selection process, this amendment would allow outgo-
ing governors to ﬁ  ll a signiﬁ  cant number of judicial vacancies. 
The amendment would essentially reverse a 2006 decision that such vacancies be ﬁ  lled by the newly sworn-in governor. 
Governors who have been voted out or chosen not to seek 
re-election should not be allowed to ﬁ  ll vacant judgeships at the last minute. Although the amendment would require judges to be selected from a slate by a nominating commission, governors would still likely seek out judges who share their ideology.
There is simply no reason to give lame-duck governors more 
control over the Florida judicial system. The Alligator recom-mends a vote of No on Amendment 3.

On the spookiest night of the year, the 
ghosts and ghouls of Gainesville gleefully 
greet the town, but which are truth or ﬁ  ction is still under speculation.
Most ghost sightings are psychic record-
ings or imprints of emotionally charged or repetitive events, said Andrew Nichols, the founder of the North Florida Parapsychology Association.
“Anywhere that humans have 
lived and died is haunted,” he said.
These types of hauntings are nei-
ther intelligent nor interactive and are usually described as a feeling, 
sound, smell or other sensory effect, 
he said. Very rarely do full-bodied apparitions show up.
When these phenomena start, ghost sto-
ries and urban legends are often created as explanations. The stories usually involve an event or character that existed but with a ﬁ  c-tional twist.
Just because the story isn’t true doesn’t 
mean the paranormal phenomenon isn’t real, Nichols said. 
Gainesville and UF have a few ghost sto-
ries of their own.
Norman Hall is rumored to be haunted by 
school children involved in an elevator acci-dent when it was still an elementary school.
Beaty Towers are rumored to be haunted 
by a girl who jumped to her death in the ‘70s 
and inspired the Tom Petty song “American 
Girl.”
However, UF historians have found no 
proof of an elevator accident at Norman Hall or of a girl who committed suicide from one of the towers.UF spokesman Steve Orlando said he had 
the opportunity to ask Tom Petty if the song was about her — the singer said it wasn’t.
Thomas Hall is rumored to be haunted 
by Steve, a cook who worked in the building when it was still a cafeteria. There is a little bit of truth to this tale: Students made up a 
story to remember a cook who actually lived 
and died there.
Another local haunt is the Herlong Man-
sion in Micanopy, where the daughter of the 
original owner is rumored to inhabit the building. Current owner, Caro-lyn Stevens-West, said Inez Herlong moved into the mansion and sup-posedly died in a diabetic coma in 
her bedroom on the third ﬂ  oor.
Stevens-West said this story was 
made up by a previous owner in the 
1980s to attract more business. Inez bought 
the mansion but couldn’t have died on the third ﬂ  oor: It wasn’t renovated into bedrooms 
until the 1980s, and there’s no evidence she 
died in the house.
Although the story is false, guests regu-
larly report strong scents of rose or lilac in the bedrooms. But that’s the spookiest thing hap-pening in the historic bed and breakfast.
The Hippodrome State Theatre also boasts 
its own ghost story.
Rusty Salling, the theater’s resident ghost 
expert, said it is haunted by a woman who arrived late to the trial and execution of her son when the theater was still a federal court-
house in the early 20th century. 
There’s no evidence that the story is true, 
and he’s never seen the ghost, but a few times 
a year, people claim to see or hear her son. A few years ago, an intern had a conversation with a man who apparently wasn’t there.
She refused to go to the basement again.

In a one-night-only event, 
Dance Alive National Ballet will 
present two original Halloween 
stories for the ﬁ  rst time, and au-
dience costumes are encouraged.
“Scheherazade” and “Vampy-
ra” will show Friday at 7:30 p.m. at the Phillips Center for the Per-
forming Arts, followed by a Mas-
querade Ball from 9:30 to 11 p.m. at the Phillips Center Squitieri Studio Theatre.
“It’s a perfect event for Hal-
loween,” said Kim Tuttle, the bal-let’s executive artistic director. 
“It’s a good time, ballet from 
a high-level dance company, and the dancers are stupendous.”
In the ﬁ  rst story, everyone is 
alive, while in the second, every-one isn’t.
“It’s not a stuffy old ballet,” 
said Linda Rocha, Dance Alive’s director of development.
Set in an exotic fantasy land 
somewhere in Arabia, “Schehe-
razade” is a romantic ballet based 
on the 1,001 nights stories from the Middle East. 
With passionate aspects rang-
ing from love to murder, audi-ence members’ every emotion will be touched, Tuttle said.
The Shah constantly chooses 
beautiful women to marry but 
because of his former wife, he’s 
distrustful and ends up killing them on their wedding night. 
The ballet opens with his wife 
Zobeide in an affair with the Golden Slave. The Shah demands 
their execution. After their 
deaths, Scheherazade marries the 
Shah and hopes to change him. 
Each night for 1,001 nights, 
she tells him wondrous tales but 
doesn’t ﬁ  nish them before he falls 
asleep. He learns to trust her, and 
together, they reign with grace. 
Tuttle said she choreographed the romantic ballet with beautiful Russian music by Rimsky-Kor-sakov. She described the dances as dramatic, stylized and like a 
grand opera. 
“The dance between the beau-
tiful wife and Golden Slave will 
be sensual and luscious,” she said.
Amanda Maier, a 19-year-old 
UF business management sopho-more, has been a dancer since she was 3 years old and has seen 
many professional dance produc-
tions, including “Swan Lake.”
“I love watching the grace and 
movement the human body can create with music,” Maier said.
Then, in a tongue-in-cheek 
approach, “Vampyra” will be a fun and campy story, Tuttle said, where the main character really enjoys being a vampire. 
It’s the total opposite of “Sche-
herazade” but still has a high-quality dance.
Vampyra is the queen of the 
vampires, and she has an outra-geous Brazilian sidekick who 
helps her go after her victims. 
The victims are her many lovers and when she takes their lives, some are surprised, while others 
are happy about being sacriﬁ  ces.           
Tickets for the ballet are $10 
for students, and $15 to $40 for 
the general public. Both acts will last about 40 minutes each. 
Tickets for the ball are $35. 
Both can be purchased at the Phillips Center Box Ofﬁ  ce or by calling 352-392-2787.

The demon barber of Fleet Street will 
be at UF through Sunday.
The School of Theatre and Dance 
presents “Sweeney Todd: The Demon 
Barber of Fleet Street,” at the Nadine M. 
McGuire Theatre and Dance Pavilion. 
Tickets are $13 for students and $17 for the general public. 
“Our ‘Sweeney Todd’ offers a differ-
ent twist on a familiar story,” said direc-tor Tony Mata. “Audience members can expect a version that is more contempo-rary than most (other productions).”
The musical, set in 19th century Lon-
don, follows the life of eccentric barber Benjamin Barker aka Sweeney Todd, as well as his revenge on the cunning judge who exiled him for 15 years. Bloodthirsty and full of revenge, Todd enters a meat pie shop owned by Mrs. Lovett, who joins forces with Todd by introducing a carnal ingredient to her meat pies that attract Londoners to the 
shop and to Sweeney’s barber chair of 
death. 
The revenge musical has had great 
success and became one of Broadway’s favorites. “There is a lot of terrifying and 
creepy moments,” Mata said, “I don’t want to give too much away. I want you to come see it.”
He originally directed the show pro-
fessionally 13 years ago.
“In the movie, you don’t capture the 
blood and gore like on the stage,” he said. “I was excited to rethink it. I had done it more Victorian and wanted to do the show differently.”
Jason Collins, a UF professor and 
Sweeney Todd’s understudy, said the cast rehearsed every weeknight for six hours and even once on the weekend.
“(This production) really has to be 
seen to believe,” Collins said. “It’s a world Tony Mata has created (that’s) very postmodern but still in a Victorian England setting.” 
If you plan to come Friday for the 
Halloween performance, don’t forget to wear your costume and stay afterward for a costume contest and for photos with the cast.
Performance times are at 7:30 p.m.  
Saturday and at 2 p.m. Sunday. Most shows have sold out, but you can buy tickets in advance at the University Box Ofﬁ  ce or through ticketmaster.com.‘Come and visit your good friend Sweeney’ on campus

Burlesque, an aerialist show and a mas-
querade ball create the perfect Halloween 
trifecta — and puppets will perform them all Saturday.
Gainesville residents and UF students 
can go out to Market Street Gainesville and indulge in these performances by puppet company Dolphin Wizard Co.
“We decided not to do straight plays this year 
but to have it be more musical and more dance ori-ented,” said Rachel Wayne, manager at Dolphin Wizard Co.   
The traveling showcase promises a special sur-
prise at the interactive cabaret edition of teatro de 
los muertos, using elements from “The Rocky Hor-
ror Picture Show” and “Alien” to make the show just the right amount of bizarre. There will be about nine performers and a total of 13 acts, each giving a different spooky feel for the audience.
“It’s going to be a bit of a wild ride,” Wayne said. “It’s deﬁ  nitely an alternative and adult show, so you should know going in that you’re seeing burlesque and almost complete nudity.”
Dolphin Wizard Co. designs and cre-
ates puppets from small hand puppets to full body suits for shows of all calibers. The company also creates foam toys of dragons, kaiju and prehistoric creatures that pay 
homage to old-fashioned monster movies 
and 1980s sci-ﬁ  .    
“I am a freak about Halloween. Proba-
bly most excited about the aerialist,” said Summer Pitt, a 22-year-old UF telecommunication senior. “It sounds pretty cool, like a little Halloween fes-tival.”
The event starts promptly at 10 p.m., but the 
venue will allow guests to take their seats at 9 p.m. 
Prices range from $3 to $10 because the com-
pany wants to give members of the community an equal opportunity to watch the show, whatever their budget may be. 
Tickets can be purchased online at puppethal-
loween.brownpapertickets.com or at the door.Puppet company showcases

Every day, Century Tower chimes 
peacefully throughout campus. But on 
Friday, Century Tower will be chiming a different, spookier tune.
UF’s carillon and organ studios will 
be hosting their Halloween recital at 7:30 p.m., starting in the University Auditori-um. This year, the recital is a taking a more theatrical approach.
“This is at least the third year we are 
doing something like this,” said 22-year-old carillonneur Mitchell Stecker. “It gets people who don’t usually listen to the carillon to listen to some sort of organ and 
carillon music.”
Dressed in costumes, the seven  caril-
lonneurs’ performance will be peppered 
with entertaining antics, which can be seen on a livestream at bit.ly/1rSaDQZ.
“The performers will double as ac-
tors,” Stecker said. “We’ll be doing a lot of spooky, fun stuff.”The recital will begin with the organists 
in the auditorium setting the mood for the 
event.
“For better or for worse, there’s an as-
sociation that the organ is a scary instru-
ment,” Stecker said. “The idea probably stemmed from that.”
The audience will later be led outside 
to hear the carillon bells for the second half of the show. A large screen will display the carillonneurs in real time on the north 
side of Century Tower.
“This is a much more of a low-key 
event. It will not be stuffy nor boring,” 
Stecker, a UF linguistics and music ﬁ  fth-year student, said. “This event will deﬁ  -nitely be something interesting for some-one who wants to get into a Halloween mood.” 
The free event will be family-friendly.
Laura Ellis, a UF associate professor of 
music, is the brains behind the event and 
expects the audience to enjoy what they have in store.
“There are many famous organ pieces 
associated with Halloween,” Ellis said. “There will be some familiar tunes and a couple of surprises.” Ominous bells over campuscreeeeepy10, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, OCTOBER 30, 2014

Beloved grandmother/benevo-
lent witch Aggie Cromwell said it 
best in Disney’s 1998 cinematic mas-terpiece “Halloweentown”:
“Being normal is vastly over-
rated.”
Though it’s tough to cast doubts 
upon normal costumes (think: witch, tacky tourist, ghost under a sheet, etc.), this is the one time a year you can step into anyone else’s shoes. Do you really want them to be tube sock sandals?
Let’s try something more fancy. 
(That’s right — you already know.)
Iggy Azalea makes for a ri-
diculously glam Halloween getup. Channel the Aussie rap queen in a high ponytail, patterned crop top with matching bottoms and brightly colored pumps. With some electric pink lipstick, dramatic winged eye-liner and a few signature beauty 
marks, you’re in business. “Fancy” 
may have been No. 1 on the Bill-board Hot 100 for only seven weeks, but it will play on in our hearts for-ever.
If Iggy’s not hitting a high note, 
perhaps diabolical criminal master-mind is more your scene.
Gillian Flynn’s novel-turned-
movie “Gone Girl” made every-one glad they were not married to psychopath Amy Dunne, perfect blonde hair or not. Spoiler alert: Re-member when Amy comes crawling back from her (fake) hostage situa-
tion straight into husband Nick’s 
arms? Recreate the scene with a wig of blonde hair, copious amounts of fake blood and “Missing Amy Dunne” ﬂ  iers to help drive the mes-sage home. 
If Amy’s a little dark, how about 
light green? 
In the form of Gamora from 
“Guardians of the Galaxy,” of 
course! The weapons-wielding, 
no-nonsense tolerating alien from afar rocked in this year’s summer blockbuster ﬁ  lm. Deck yourself out in black pleather pants, a matching tank, one or two swords, green face paint and a mane of dark hair. Con-tinuously shout out, “I’m going to die surrounded by the biggest idiots 
in the galaxy!”
Gentlemen, don’t think you’re 
absolved from getting into the spirit 
of things! Lucky for you, I’ve already thought of the perfect pop culture-relevant costume for you, and it’s a dark horse, let me tell you. 
No, not literally.Do you recall the collective sigh 
that escaped the soul of every man, woman and angsty teen with a heart and access to Ed Sheeran’s YouTube channel on Oct. 7? Yeah, that was when he released his music video for “Thinking Out Loud” and single-handedly upped the ante for anyone who thought they might make “a nice gesture” for romance’s sake.
All you need is shaggy ginger 
locks, a white button-down, dark dress pants with matching vest and a sleeve of tattoos. Dazzle random people in the room by quietly saying, “Your soul could never grow old, it’s evergreen” and “Your smile’s 
forever in my mind and memory.” 
Beware of swooning onlookers who may throw themselves at your feet.Awesomely abnormal Halloween costumes

Although The FEST 13 
boasts many big names, a ton 
of lesser-known groups that de-serve some spotlight will take on Gainesville this weekend. 
Among them is PUP, a Canadi-
an group with both metal and pop-punk sensibilities and an impressive list of fans, includ-ing critics at Noisey, Stereogum and SPIN. The Avenue spoke with lead singer Stefan Babcock to talk about PUP’s freshman FEST appearance.
Is the punk scene very dif-
ferent in Canada versus the States?
I think Toronto has a great 
punk scene — there are amaz-ing bands that come out of Can-ada, particularly Toronto. But I feel like the bands have a com-munity vibe in our scene, but 
there’s not a huge community 
of people who go to see those kinds of bands.
Are there any other groups 
at FEST you’re excited about seeing?
The Melvins are playing, 
right? That would be insane. I’d love to go see those guys. Aside from that, there are a ton of bands that are part of that scene that we’ve never seen play 
before but heard great things 
about. We’re pals with them on the Internet now: You Blew It!, Chumped, Beach Slang, our friends Cayetana. There’s this band called Gnarwolves — they’re like the hot shit in the UK. They are the band of the moment right now in the punk 
scene, and I feel like it hasn’t 
really translated here yet, but it will. I’m really excited to see them rip it up.
So what can Gainesville ex-
pect from a PUP show?
Our shows get pretty crazy. 
We played to 40 people the other day in … this shithole in 
Canada, and it was a 40-person 
insane mosh pit. I’m hoping for something similar at FEST. Expect crowd surﬁ  ng, expect to get beer thrown all over you if you’re in the front.
PUP will perform at The 
Wooly on Friday from 8:50 to 9:30 p.m. Tickets are available at 
thefestﬂ  .com. For an extended

Avenue Writer
A J-School graduate swung his 
guitar down and smashed it on-
stage at Lollapalooza.
During his afternoon set at the 
Chicago festival, Benjamin Booker 
realized the event marked a transi-
tion in his musical career.
By the end of his set, a backup 
guitar his parents bought him laid in pieces. Members of the crowd ﬂ  ocked to claim the destroyed memorabilia.
“I was walking around (Lol-
lapalooza) afterward, and there were people with pieces of my childhood guitar,” Booker said. 
After touring numerous fes-
tivals, opening for The White Stripes’ frontman, Jack White, and performing on TV shows such as “Late Night With David Letterman,” Booker returns to Gainesville today for a headlining show at the High Dive
Surprisingly, this will be Book-
er’s ﬁ  rst live performance in front of a Gainesville crowd.
“When I lived in Gainesville, 
I didn’t play any shows,” Booker admitted. “I wrote my ﬁ  rst four or ﬁ  ve songs while I was out in my yard or around town.”
The past year marks an ex-
traordinary jump for Booker, go-ing from an unsigned performer to climbing the sales charts with his debut LP on ATO Records. His 
raw, gritty sound fuses traditional 
blues with hard rock ‘n’ roll.
Booker grew up in Tampa and 
attended the International Bacca-laureate program at Hillsborough High School.
“At Hillsborough, I had a group 
of friends, and we were all into the same kind of music, “ he said. 
“We’d enjoy watching local shows 
all the time.”
After high school, he came to UF 
as a journalism major and worked for Reitz Union Board Entertain-ment and wrote for the Alligator.
“I got to meet bands a lot,” he 
said. “(RUB) brought Deerhunter, and that was huge for me. I was 
freaking out.”
After graduating, Booker 
moved to New Orleans and played 
acoustic shows.
“We were playing three shows 
a week in New Orleans — maybe because we loved it so much,” he said. “We ended up spending so much time on (our music), and it 
all worked out.”
Booker plans to play his 
Gainesville debut like his festival 
performances, but he wants to keep the performance original, too.
“You feel more pressured to 
keep it energetic for a festival set,” he said. “We try to keep it fresh from show to show. If a song feels 
wrong, we’ll change it up a bit.”UF alum plays High DivemusicBUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

All week, UF players have talked about how 
they want to face Todd Gurley when Florida (3-3, 
2-3 Southeastern Conference) takes on Georgia 
(6-1, 4-1 SEC) in its annual meeting in Jackson-
ville on Saturday.
The Gators are third in the SEC in yards al-
lowed per rush (3.08) and believe that in order to 
be the best, you have to play the best.
“He’s a great player and great players bring 
great competition out of you,” UF Buck line-
backer Dante Fowler Jr. said. “I feel like he’ll be a good competition for our defense coming up and 
just for the team.”
But unfortunately for the Gators, they will not 
be facing the Bulldogs’ lead tailback come Sat-
urday.
The NCAA ruled Wednesday that Gurley — 
who was suspended indefinitely on Oct. 9 for accepting money from memorabilia dealers and has not played in UGA’s last two games — will sit out for two more games. Georgia appealed 
the suspension, but if it’s not overturned, Gurley 
will not be eligible to compete again until Geor-gia faces Auburn on Nov. 15.
“It’s a shame. Todd’s an outstanding player, 
he’s a great competitor,” Florida coach Will Mus-champ said on Wednesday’s SEC teleconference. “I think his biggest talent is his competitive edge and the guy runs and blocks and does every-thing at a very high level so he’s an outstanding 
player.”
But Gurley’s suspension has not impacted 
Florida’s game plan for Saturday’s matchup.

Florida volleyball took another 
sweep against Georgia on Wednesday, 
extending the Gators set win streak to 
15.
In No. 8 Florida’s (17-3, 11-0 South-
eastern Conference) 3-0 win against 
unranked Georgia (10-12, 2-8 SEC), it 
was the Gators’ offense that thrived.
In total, the Gators finished the 
night with 11 service aces — the high-
est of the season and the most in a match since Florida faced Texas A&M 
on Nov. 3, 2013 — and a match attack 
percentage of .400.
However, it was the second set that 
showcased Florida’s dominance on of-fense. Florida recorded a team hitting clip of .714 – the highest attack per-
centage since posting a .588 hitting ef-
ficiency in the first set against Alabama on Oct. 6, 2013 – and held Georgia to 8 points in the set. 
The Gators held the Bulldogs to a 
.045 attacking clip which also aided  
the 25-8 win in Set 2.
“It was one of the strangest set two-
three’s I’ve been around,” coach Mary 
Wise said.
“(We went) 25-8 and I believe five of 
the eight (points) came when we started making some subs. They weren’t pass-ing well. Whatever they did between sets two and three, they came back a UF volleyball sweeps

GRAHAM HALL
Alligator Writer @Graham311
For the first time in her collegiate career, 
Carla Batchelor feels like a little fish in a big 
pond. 
The junior spent her first two seasons 
at Northwest Florida State College in Niceville, where she saw a considerable amount of playing time, starting 63 of the 
65 games she played in. 
In those 65 contests, the 5-foot-10  
Batchelor averaged 11.8 points and 7.4 re-
bounds per game, leading her to First-team All-Panhandle Conference honors in both 
years.
When her sophomore season concluded, 
Batchelor felt she needed a change of scen-
ery. 
Feeling content with her accomplish-
ments, Batchelor made the jump from ju-nior college to the NCAA, joining the Flori-da Gators to finish her career.
While Batchelor knew things would be different, she probably didn’t expect she would have to relearn the defensive aspect 
of her game. 
“Coming from a place where we played 
strictly zone, and now playing strictly man 
has been really hard to adjust,” Batchelor said. 
“But I’ve been getting better every day 
at it.”
Aside from the obvious assignment dif-
ferences in switching from zone to man defense, the transition required Batchelor 
to put an increased focus on her quickness 
and endurance. 
Where she previously was required to 
learn the roles of the zone defense in just 
two spots, a man defense requires consis-
tent rotation and awareness of every player on the court. 
For Batchelor, the increased emphasis 
on quickness was a natural adoption, as 
she was often called upon to defend guards Batchelor adjusting to UF
See VoLLey, p Age 15
See w -HoopS, p Age 15much better passing team.”
Aiding Florida’s offensive 
effort was right-side hitter Alex 
Holston, who finished the night 
with her first double-double of her career with a team high 12 kills on  19 attempts and a .526 attack percentage — just shy of her .545 career attack percent-age — and career-best 11 digs, as well as three block assists and 
three service aces.
The 6-foot-1 outside hitter 
is the third player on Florida’s roster to earn a double-double 
for the season – behind fresh-man middle blocker Rhamat Alhassan, who shared her first and only double-double with ju-
nior setter Mackenzie Dagostino 
against Marquette on Sept. 19. 
Dagostino picked up her second and most recent double-double of the season against Georgia on Oct. 10.  
Holston has been praised for 
her larger role in her second year 
with the team by playing in a full 
six rotations per set.
Her play against Georgia was 
easily her best of the season — 
she finished the night with only 
two serving errors and two at-tack errors..
In 20 matches played and 
70 sets total, Holston leads the 
Gators in attacks (244), kills (3.49 
per set) and points (4.09 per set). 
The sophomore is currently 
ranked 11th in the SEC for hit-
ting percentage (.333) and sixth 
in kills with 3.46 per set. 
In her freshman year she fin-
ished the season ranked sixth in the SEC with a .382 attacking percentage, placing her second in the league.
“I think Alex has become 
a multi-dimensional opposite player,” Wise said. “Her kills out of the back row, her blocking, her serving, her digging; those are 
skills that weren’t in her game a 
year ago, but they’re definitely a part of the Florida team this year.”
A television broadcast contrib-
uted to this report.“Their scheme really hasn’t 
changed with him being out,” 
defensive coordinator D.J. Dur-
kin said. “Obviously, we’ve 
had the benefit of seeing some games with him out. They’ve got some really good running backs 
besides him. Obviously, he’s a 
great player, but they have some other really talented running backs they can do a lot of the same things he does.”
With Gurley ineligible, Geor-
gia will continue to ride true freshman Nick Chubb as its starting tailback.
In UGA’s last two games — 
a 34-0 shutout against Missouri and a 45-32 win against Arkansas — Chubb has picked up where Gurley dropped off, amassing 
68 carries, 345 yards and three 
touchdowns on the ground.
“The running back they have 
right now, Nick Chubb, he’s 
just almost the same (as Gur-
ley),” linebacker Jarrad Davis said. “He’s just maybe a little bit shorter. That’s it. He’s a great back, too. He puts up a lot of yards and he runs physical just 
like Todd Gurley.”
Stopping the run will be key 
for Florida on Saturday, as Geor-
gia’s ground game accounts for 60.8 percent of its offense.
“It’s going to be a physical 
game,” Fowler said. “They like to run with two backs, so we’ve seen how that is with LSU and 
‘Bama and teams like that. That’s 
when we love to get our noses dirty and just go out there and play physical.”
While Florida has confidence 
that they can contain Geor-gia’s run game, Muschamp said Wednesday that execution on the field will be the main deter-
minant for how the game pans 
out.
“Don’t confuse effort with 
production,” Muschamp said. “That’s one of the things I told our team on Sunday after Mis-souri. You can go practice ex-tremely well and practice hard 
and prepare yourself well and 
play hard in the game. But if you are not productive that’s not what we’re looking for. You’ve 
got to be productive. You can 
have great effort and maybe not have the production, the results that you want. We just need to be more productive.’’ THURSDAY, OCTOBER 30, 2014 § ALLIGATOR, 15

women’s basketball’s media day.
Holston recorded her first career double-double
VoLLey , from page 14
The junior adds height to a previously short team
who are smaller than her while 
at NWFSC. 
“I’ve been able to work on 
my quickness, but my previous two seasons I had experiences with being quick,” Batchelor said.
“I’m not really behind, but it 
is a little faster. But I can get a little bit faster, still.”
With the addition of Batch-
elor, the Gators receive a player 
who has an advantage over 
several of the other players — she comes from a team that fea-tured height in the front court, something the Gators severely 
missed over the last two sea-
sons. 
“I was used to playing with 
big girls, and being down low, so it hasn’t been too much of an 
adjustment,” Batchelor said.
That experience has helped 
ease Batchelor into the team, 
and she’s been able to share 
what she’s learned with the rest 
of her new teammates.
The Gators hope to improve 
this season with the addition of 
front court depth, an element 
that was sorely missed as Flori-da often had to start redshirt se-nior guard Kayla Lewis at cen-
ter and play a small rotation. 
The team has also helped Batchelor grow as a player, and she no longer has to worry 
about being a team leader. 
She just wants to go out and 
play basketball. 
“It’s so much easier to have 
other people be a leader to me, when I was so used to being a leader to everyone else,” Batch-elor said. 
She figures to be a rotation 
player for the Gators, a multi-dimensional hybrid guard with post experience who can step 
out and hit the three-point 
shot. 
Like most players, Batchelor 
is itching for the calendar to hit Nov. 14, when the Gators open 
the season against Jacksonville. 
It’s a fresh start for Batch-
elor. 
With the support of her 
teammates and family — the 
Germantown, Maryland, na-tive has 15 siblings, and all but one are older than herself 
—Batchelor has the right com-
pany around her helping her succeed. 
Now that the transition is 
over, Batchelor has improved 
and is ready to hit the court for 
her first NCAA minutes. 
“I was struggling when I got 
here, and I’ve improved tons,” Batchelor said. “I have a little 
way to go conditioning wise, 
but I’m going to get there.”W-HooPS ,

UF players celebrate with Savannah Jordan following a goal during Florida’s 3-1 win against Tennessee 
on Friday at James G. Pressly Stadium. The Gators play their final regular-season match tonight at 7 against Vanderbilt. Florida is currently second in the SEC standings, one point behind Texas A&M.

The Florida soccer team wraps 
up its regular season tonight when 
it hosts Vanderbilt at 7 at James G. 
Pressly Stadium.
The eighth-ranked Gators (13-4, 
8-2 Southeastern Conference) sit just one point behind No. 7 Texas 
A&M in the SEC standings. With 
a win against Vanderbilt (7-9-2, 
2-6-2 SEC), Florida has a chance to 
secure the top spot in the confer-
ence.
“For our team, the only thing we 
can control is our play and the out-
come of Thursday night’s game,” 
sophomore Savannah Jordan said. 
“We know that all that we can do 
is come out with three points and 
hope for the best against the other team.”
Home games have also been few 
and far between for Florida this 
year. Tonight’s game against the 
Commodores will be the Gators’ seventh home match this season, 
and Florida is happy to be closing 
out the year on its home turf.“We’re looking forward to be-
ing at home against Vandy,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “Technically our last regular season home game, 
we don’t know if we’ll be playing 
here again.”
If Florida isn’t chosen as a 
host school in this year’s NCAA championship tournament like it 
was last year, then tonight’s game 
against Vanderbilt will be the last 
home game of the season for the 
Gators.
For the team, it’s hard to believe 
that this 2014 season has gone by so fast.
“Especially now that it’s getting 
to the end, I’m thinking more about not just taking this for granted and 
going through every day and see-
ing what we have right now,” se-
nior Jillian Graff said. “What we 
have right now is incredible, next year I’m not gonna have this, so 
not taking things for granted is a 
big thing for me right now.”
This 20th season of Florida soc-
cer has seen many Gators step up and make productive strides in 
their games. As Florida finishes its regular 
season tonight and heads into the 
SEC tournament next week, it will need that same defensive strength 
and offensive output that it has 
gotten all year.
The Gators have scored 40 
goals this year and have limited opponents to only 15. Florida has 
also outshot its opponents 254 to 
167 in 17 games this season. That 
spells trouble for Vanderbilt, who 
is second to last in the SEC in goals per game and third to last in goals 
allowed.
Florida will look to finish the 
regular season with a strong out-ing tonight as it attempts to take 
sole possession of first place in the 
SEC and prepares for the confer-
ence tournament next week.
“It seems so weird because I 
feel like we were just here last year. It flew by,” Jordan said. “I’m 
looking forward to going into the 
tournament and I think our team’s 
in a good position right now. It’s 
exciting but kind of sad at the same time that the season’s kind of com-
ing to an end.”UF, Vandy cap regular season tonight
� YOUNGER PLAYERS 
ARE LEADING THE TEAM.
LUIS TORRES
Alligator Writer @LFTorresIII
Coach Emily Glaser has 
an advantage most coaches 
dream to have.
The advantage is young 
talent that produces results on the golf course and isn’t afraid to work hard to improve their 
games.
The Florida women’s golf 
roster boasts four underclass-
men -- three sophomores and one freshman. 
The four of them will be 
counted on heavily when the spring season starts for the team in January.
The three sophomores are 
Maria Torres, Kelly Grassel and Karolina Vlckova, and the freshman is Taylor Tom-linson. 
The four of them make up 
more than half of the play-ers on UF’s roster and each of them competed in the final 
tournament of the fall for UF 
with all of them finishing in the top 45 in the event.
Torres was the lowest scor-
ing player in the lineup in 
Wilmington, North Carolina,  
and her tie for 11th place was the best result of any player on the team in the fall. 
Glaser sat down with Tor-
res before the event and dis-cussed and loosening up.
“We talked about going 
into the event and maybe 
playing a little bit more ag-
gressive and just kind of let-ting her fly,” Glaser said.
Vlckova had her best fin-
ish in the fall as well in Wilm-ington as she finished in 23rd place. Her best previous finish was a tie for 53rd at the Cou-gar Classic. 
Vlckova is a reliable player 
in the lineup as well because she’s competed in every tour-nament since her freshman year.
Something that has stood 
out to Glaser throughout the fall is the amount of work Tomlinson and Grassel put in. Even though they are two 
of the youngest on the team, 
Glaser knows she won’t have to push either of them to get better.
“The cool thing about Tay-
lor and Kelly is they are both really hard workers,” Glaser said. “They are probably the hardest workers on the team 
and they are our young play-
ers, which is great for us.”
Glaser knows how badly 
Tomlinson wants to be the best and at times, Glaser has had to 
pull Tomlinson aside to make 
sure she doesn’t overdo it.  
“Taylor is one that really 
doesn’t play with a lot of fear 
at all, she wants it bad,” Gla-
ser said. “Almost to the point where we have to sort of rein it in and have her get out of her own way a little bit.”
The fact that Tomlinson 
competed in each tournament in the fall in her freshman year sets up well for the spring por-
tion of her first season. Build-
ing valuable experience is important for a young player and Glaser sees a lot of poten-tial in Tomlinson.   
“I think experience is what 
will be the key for her, even though she’s only a freshman, I think we’ll look for big things 
from her,” Glaser said. “She’s 
a very good player, she’s very talented and fits in well with the team and because she is such a hard worker, in the end 
that usually pays off for play-
ers.”UF women’s golf ends 
Fall on strong note
