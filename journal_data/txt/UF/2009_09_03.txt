UAA targets
UF's carbon
emissions
By BROOKE KELLY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Though 90,000 cheering fans will fill the Swamp on Sat-
urday, one thing will be missing: carbon emissions.
Neutral Gator, a nonprofit initiative created in 2008, will
team up with the University Athletic Association to reduce
UF's carbon footprint and help reach the
UAA's climate neutrality goal by 2025.
This will be the first-ever carbon neu-
tral NCAA season working to offset the
carbon footprint created by athletic pro-
grams.
"I think it shows that the UAA is taking
Prizz1aa great sense of responsibility by trying to
eliminate their entire carbon footprint,"
said Anna Prizzia, director of UF's Office of Sustainability.
"And by partnering with Neutral Gator to locally offset it
instead of just purchasing the offsets is just great."
Neutral Gator only worked on offsetting home games

Interviews begin
for Senate seats
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
Student Government's po-
litical parties will interview po-
tential Senate candidates at the
Reitz Union today, Friday and
Tuesday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Ariana Alfonso, the super-
visor of elections for SG, said
the Unite, Progress and Orange
and Blue parties registered for
the election, which will be held
Sept. 29 and 30.
SG's party presidents agreed
that all candidates should bring
at least one thing to their inter-
views: ideas.
Fifty Senate seats are avail-able, including 14 for on-cam-
pus housing areas and 36 for
off-campus housing districts.
Students interested in run-
ning for Senate also need to
bring their Gator 1 Cards to the
Reitz Union, Room 284, and
they must fill out a qualifying
form before talking to any of
the parties.
"They should come pre-
pared to both ask and answer
questions," she said.
Joey Regalado, the Unite
Party president, said candidates
don't have to come with revolu-
tionary ideas. Instead, he wants

UF aims to stop hazing
* GROUP WILL TEACH STUDENTS
TO IDENTIFY, AVOID HAZING.
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@aligator org
Three recent scandals involving stu-
dent organizations have brought hazing
into the limelight at UF, but officials are
hoping a new educational campaign will
put a stop to the practice.
Jack Causseaux, associate director for
Sorority and Fraternity Affairs, said UF
is planning to create a coalition to find
ways to educate students, faculty and
staff about how to identify and avoid
hazing.
The coalition will likely include mem-
bers from the University Police Depart-
ment, the University Athletic Association
and Student Government, as well as rep-resentatives from UF's student groups
and recreational sports programs, Caus-
seaux said.
"Hazing is not a fraternity and so-
rority problem only," he said, adding it
happens in major sports programs, club
sports and even student groups.
Chris Loschiavo, director of UF's Stu-
dent Conduct and Conflict Resolution,
said he doesn't
U F think many stu-Administration dents realize how
dangerous haz-
ing can be and how to prevent it from
happening to them.
Loschiavo said although the campaign
has been in the works for years, three re-
cent cases of hazing, which all happened
within the span of a year, lent the initia-
tive some urgency."It's now more important than ever,"

Repairs

Alligator Contributing Writer
Bivens Arm is getting a make-
over.
The 57-acre nature park closed
Sept. 1 in order to undergo an an-
ticipated three-month construc-
tion project aimed at improving
the park's boardwalks, bridges
and pavilion decking.
"Bivens Arm has been on our
project list for some time now,"
said Stefanie Nagid, natural re-
source management interim pro-
gram coordinator for the City of
Gainesville.
Although the construction is
commissioned to be completed no
later than Dec. 1, Nagid said the
date may fluctuate with uncon-
trollable circumstances, includ-
ing a hurricane
or an onslaught
of rain.
Bivens Arm
Nature Park
hosts nearly 60
acres of marsh-
es, soaring pine
Nagid and oak forests,
a one-mile nature trail, a 1,200-
foot boardwalk and a wide array
of wildlife.
"Bivens Arm is actually one
of our oldest acquired parks,"
Nagid said.
According to Nagid, the pres-
sure-treated wood used to con-
struct the bridges and boardwalk
has a lifespan of only 15 to 20
years.
In Florida, where the weather
conditions are notoriously moist,
the wood decays more rapidly,
she said.
She added that for Bivens
Arm, the lifespan is shorter still
due to the shady, moist condi-
tions provided by the pine and
oak canopy.
"[The bridges and boardwalk]
were very old and had become
unsafe," Nagid said. "The pavil-
ion itself was also unsafe, but for
different reasons."
The renovations, which will
be completed by McNeal and
White Contractors Inc., will cost
$98,340.
The renovations will result in
a slightly shortened boardwalk
and a minor adjustment in the
nature trail where the boardwalk
is being remodeled, Nagid said.
Admission to Bivens Arm is
free.
The nature park will reopen
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily when
the construction ends.2009 Pricewaterhouse~oopers LLP, All rights reserved. "Pricewaterhouse~oopers" refers to Pricewaterhouse~oopers LLP (a D~elaware lmited lability partnership) or, as the context requires, the Pricewaterhouseuoopers

Organization rallies for national health care reform
By C.J. PRUNER gove ent should expand health
Alligator Writer care or let it lie. I A
At the political circus that unfold-
ed on the lawn of the North Florida
Regional Medical Center Wednesday,
Hope Kelly played the role of a clown
who lost her smile a long time ago.
Amid the sign-waving and horn-
honking, Kelly quietly sat in her chair,
stoically holding a cardboard sign for
cars on Newberry Road to see.
Kelly was one of about 70 people
-composed of the young and the old,
the strong and weak, the sick and the
healthy -who stood side by side to
support health care reform and repre-
sent political organization MoveOn.
According to MoveOn spokesman
Fred Pratt, who helped organize the
demonstration, Wednesday's effort
was one of more than 300 that took
place across the country. Thousands
gathered to say loud and clear: "We
can't afford to wait."
For many, including Pratt, political
activism is nothing new.
"I've been called everything in the
book: communist, socialist, fascist,"
Pratt said, happily waving to traffic.
Since President Barack Obama pre-
sented his platform to Americans, the
country has beenbitterly divided over
the question of whether the federalFor Kelly, there is no choice.
Her 52-year-old son, Christopher,
a former volunteer firefighter in Key
Largo, lies in a hospital bed in Miami.
His body, she said, once strong and
full of life, is ravaged by leukemia,
a vicious disease that lays waste to
blood, bone marrow and whatever
else is in its path. Christopher and his
family cannot pay for the $460,000
bone marrow transplant, an opera-
tion, Kelly believes, that might not ar-
rive in time to save her son's life.
"I feel like I'm letting him down,"
said Kelly, who suffers from multiple
sclerosis. "I can see him getting sicker
and sicker right before my eyes."
The solution, according to Kelly
and the others who surrounded her,
is to offer a public option for health
insurance, which would insure those
who can't afford it.
They argue that programs such
as Medicare and Medicaid are not as
horrific as opponents say.
"I just want to make sure everyone
in this country has what I've got," said
Bob Hofer, who has private health
insurance. "My Christian values say
you don't stand by and see people get
trounced; that's not right."

At first glance, 1013 NW Seventh Ave.
looks like a house that's no more important
than its neighbors.
But for three quarters of a century, the
house was home to the man who made it pos-
sible for black students to receive diplomas
from Gainesville high schools.On Sept. 10, the City of Gainesville will
designate the house of A. Quinn Jones Sr. as
a historical site and place a commemorative
plaque outside the home.
Before 1925, local black students were only
allowed to complete 11 years of school rather
than the 13 necessary to graduate,
Jones' son, Oliver, said his father became
the old Lincoln High School's principal in 1923,
where he began his work toward expanding
the high school to include grades 11 and 12.
Jones accomplished this when the Lincoln
High graduating class of 1925 received diplo-mas for the first time.
Oliver said when the school became the sec-
ond accredited African-American high school
in Florida in 1926, his father was overjoyed.
"He would say he was so proud that this
didn't happen in Jacksonville,
Local or Miami or anything like that,"
News Oliver Jones said. "It was here
in Gainesville."
Jones, who lived in the house at 1013 NW
Seventh Ave. from 1925 until 1997, was the
man who brought change to the school sys-
tem, said Erin Friedberg, visual arts coordina-tor for the City of Gainesville Department of
Parks, Recreation and Cultural Affairs.
"He was an instrumental educational
leader in the African-American community,"
Friedberg said.
Greg Bradley, Gainesville Community Re-
development Agency finance manager, said
several people are scheduled to speak at the
dedication ceremony, including Jones' son.
"From this ceremony, I would hope that
the community would get an opportunity to
hear the story of A. Quinn told," he said.

Group plans to offset

UF athletic program
NEUTRAL, from page 1
last year. However, the group plans to offset the entire 2009-
2010 Gators athletic program.
At Saturday's season opener, Neutral Gator will have a
"Highlights of Gators Past" themed tailgate tent in front of
the O'Connell Center where travelers can offset their emis-
sions by learning more about the organization. Each game's
tailgate tent will have a new theme where fans can learn more
about Neutral Gator's endeavors and how to get involved.
"I think it shows that the UAA is taking a great
sense of responsibility by trying to eliminate
their entire carbon footprint."
Anna Prizzia
director of UF's Office of Sustainability
Angelica Ramdhari, project coordinator at Neutral Gator,
said the tailgates will be where students come into play the
most.
The group has reached out locally as well. On Saturday, it
held a "renter's initiative" to help low-income homes become
more sustainable; there have also been bake sales and creek
restoration by planting 200 apple and cypress trees.
Neutral Gator hopes that through these projects and in-
formational tailgates, the UAA 2025 carbon neutrality goal
will be met.
"Once we get the formula down, accomplishing the goal
shouldn't be too much," Ramdhari said.

them to think of small proposals
that will increase SG's presence
and recognition on campus.
Regalado said he is looking for
a good group of candidates willing
to put themselves second and the
desires of the student body first.
"We are accepting people from
any age group, any background,
any organizational affiliation," he
said. "All are welcome to come out
for the Unite Party."
Regalado said Unite will have a
full slate of 50 senators.
Dave Schneider, the ProgressParty president, said it would be
great to have a full slate, but he
wants people committed to in-
creased openness and participa-
tion in SG.
"The priority is not to get a full
slate of half-qualified candidates,"
he said. "The
Stu dent goal is to getGovernment a slate of stu-
dent candidates
that are going to represent people
across the board."
Schneider said he wants to find
student leaders willing to repre-
sent real student interests. Candi-
dates don't need to have previous
political experience, he said.Kyle Huey, the Orange and
Blue Party president, said he looks
for candidates who are familiar
with what's going on in SG and
have opinions on SG issues like the
free newspapers on campus.
"We're looking for students
who want to make real, substan-
tive changes in SG, and everything
else is second to that," he said.
Huey said he plans to have a
full slate.
Parties must submit their can-
didate selections by 11:59 p.m.

ty's official slate will be posted

tory candidate meeting.

"We'd rather deal with it proactively than have to
discipline organizations all the time for it," he said.
Causseaux said he hopes the coalition can be formed
sometime this semester, but said things should be well
under way by the end of the school year at the latest.
According to UF records, the last student organization
found guilty of hazing was Sigma Lambda Gamma, an
18-member Latina-based sorority, which was shut down
for five years by its national organization in April.
The group imposed restrictions on recruits that in-
cluded no Facebook, make-up or fast food.
Other recent hazing cases include the Tau Epsilon
Phi fraternity, which was suspended for one year in No-
vember after recruits were found shirtless and kneeling
on the basement floor, and the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity,
which was suspended for four years in June 2008 for
activities that included wall sits and consuming large
amounts of alcohol.

in fighting H1N1
t seems the government thinks back-to-school season will
somehow resemble "28 Days Later."
The President's Council of Advisors on Science and
Technology claims that a swine flu epidemic has the po-
tential to cause up to 90,000 deaths and leave 1.8 million
Americans hospitalized, a statistic that has caused a bit of
a panic.
Even though the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention has released a counter-statement claiming that the
death tolls will not likely be that high, and the number of
deaths thus far does not suggest a future zombie apoca-
lypse, measures are still being taken to prevent a possible
disaster.
UF, for one, had a bright idea when they realized that
imposing a stringent attendance criteria could encourage
infected students to come to class. This semester, UF stu-
dents do not have to show up to exams if they are sick. This
is a good idea despite the fact that many will take advan-
tage of it (duh).
Among other preventative measures that seem like a
good idea: New York City is offering free vaccines to its 1
million-plus students, and "Sesame Street" is doing a spe-
cial about handwashing (and so is "Plaza Sesamo" in Mexi-
co, which is the cutest thing we've ever heard).
The state of Massachusetts, however, is taking the idea
of encouraging people to stay home and stay hygienic a
little too far. Currently making its way through the state
legislature is the Pandemic Response Bill. If passed, the bill
will allow the governor to declare a health emergency and
allow law enforcement officials to forcibly enter the homes
of citizens and quarantine or vaccinate them.
Whether this bill is a response to Barack Obama's team's
report is unclear. However, if it is, the Obama team needs to
issue another report that takes the Centers for Disease Con-
trol's findings into consideration. The people at the CDC
know what they're talking about, and if its slightly less
abysmal view of the coming school year will allay Ameri-
cans' fears, it should be made common knowledge.
After Hurricane Katrina, it makes sense that lawmakers
and politicians want to prevent any sort of comparable di-
saster; no one wants to take the blame for unnecessary suf-
fering or death. However, HINI is not the bubonic plague,
and it shouldn't be treated as such. Blowing things out of
proportion with exaggerated predictions or with possible
bills involving storm troopers is as irresponsible as taking
no preventative measures at all.
As Cillian Murphy's character in "28 Days Later" said,
"See, this is a really shit idea. You know why? Because it's
really obviously a shit idea." Sure, you can scare people into
washing their hands. But you don't need to scare them with
the threat of involuntary detainment and needle injection.
We know people who have had Swine Flu (former edi-
torial board member, sort-of rhymes with "Bland Sicko").
Sure it was uncomfortable, and sure, he needed to stay in-
doors. But, to him, that was common sense.
Obama needs to allay the fears of Americans who are
counting the days until the rapture by assuring them that
the death tolls will not be as high as his team initially re-
ported. He also needs to redirect state lawmakers who feel
as if they need to pass bills that infringe on the basic rights
of Americans in response to an imaginary threat.
Wash your hands, stay home when you're sick, see a
doctor if you don't feel well. That's all you need to do to
prevent Left4Dead from becoming your day-to-day. Warn-
ing people to stay safe is one thing. Frightening them half to
death is counterintuitive.

Fantasy sports provide real life skills
abor Day will officially kick off the American fan-tasy football season in 2009, and no matter where
you are this weekend you will be within earshot of a
conversation about somebody's fantasy draft.
Estimates are shaky, but the numbers floating around
the Internet suggest that 35 million Americans will play
fantasy football this year -around a tenth of the popula-
tion of our country.
Before economists can calculate how much work time
and productivity is lost to fantasy sports this year, I will
take up the mantle of defending fantasy football. What
do economists know, anyway? Haven't they already been
globally outed as a sect of misguided soothsayers who pos-
sess far too much of the public spotlight?
First of all, the fact that 35 million people may play fan-
tasy football this year is greatly relieving to me personally.
I used to have to hide my addiction to fantasy sports as if I
were concealing track marks from a heroin addiction. One
could not speak about fantasy sports in mixed company,
unless you had a particular fondness for disgusted glances
and the brisk feeling of total lameness. I used to get more
concerned looks than the people who talked about their
cousin, the child molester.
Now, we are legion. Everybody plays fantasy football,
and now some writers are beginning to think of this na-
tional digital pastime in a new light. An article by Chris
Gorski at LiveScience.com talked to college professors in
engineering and management programs across the coun-
try who feel that getting good at fantasy sports translates
to a host of other necessary skills in modem society.
Stating that fantasy sports "hold the secret to teaching
people to make insightful predictions" and teach how to
"manipulate complex and abstract systems," Gorski andthe professors state that fantasy
sports can make us all better citizens
and maybe not get so ripped off in
the real estate and stock market en-
vironments.
Another Web writer, blogger
Tommy Maple Jon Stonger, points out on Hereti-letters@alligator org calldeas.com that the variable ratio
reinforcement we all get from fanta-
sy football makes it basically like gambling -but without
the messy side effects of crushing debt or societal decay.
Stronger also lauds the competitive nature of the fantasy
environment and the camaraderie inherent in such a per-
sonal competition. Any fool misguided enough to have
stepped in front of my undefeated 2006 juggernaut "The
Stonecutters" surely knows the rancid taste of soul-crush-
ing defeat to this very day.
Some may castigate fantasy sports for the illusion of
control it grants to all of the wannabe sports executives out
there in fantasy land, or for the tidy profit these conglom-
erated media companies are making off advertising to the
teeming horde of fantasy players sitting in front of com-
puter screens all across our great nation.
To them, I have no response other than vague threats
and mumbled curses.
You see, I have graduated beyond merely playing fan-
tasy football into playing fantasy fantasy football. Each au-
tumn I pick a dozen of the more skilled fantasy players and
wait for them to win their individual leagues. I'm trying to
turn this thing into a pyramid scheme, since the other 320
million Americans are so damn fond of those things.

Morningbell album "more physical and immediate"
By MARY MANCHESS
avenue writer
The first track says it all: "Let's Not Lose
Our Heads" is a perfect description of how
Morningbell and its fans have been feeling
over the past two years.
The band has gone through a longjourney
to come out with its fourth album, "Sincerely,
Severely." And fans have been on edge with
anticipation.
The band is playing a CD release show Fri-
day at Common Grounds with the Shitty Beat-
les and Michael Claytor and His Friends.
Tickets can be purchased on Common
Grounds' Web site for $6, and doors will
open at 9 p.m. To award fans for their pa-
tience, the album will be available for $5 at
the show.
However, those who follow them on MyS-
pace, Facebook or Twitter can get the CD for
free if they follow the instructions.
The album was originally supposed to
be released in March in time for the band's
summer tour.According to lead vocalist Travis Atria, the
band was striving to get it done by then but
just couldn't make it in time.
"After the last album, I think we weren't
really kind of sure what we wanted to do, and
it just took a long time to just write this one,"
Atria said.
"I probably wrote 60 songs for this al-
bum, and most of them we just threw away
because they weren't any good, or we didn't
think they were any good."
While most bands usually release an al-
bum and then go on tour, Morningbell has
never been able to do this.
Atria said they have a short tour planned
for November, but it won't be anything like
the tour from this past summer, which was
through 21 states.
Despite not doing the normal CD-tour
combination, Atria said he is just happy with
how the album turned out. With influences
from the late '60s to the early '70s and mu-
sicians like Curtis Mayfield and Ike and Tina
Turner, he said that their new sound is a littlebit more upbeat than the previous albums.
"We fought quite a bit about all these
songs, but maybe that is why it turned out so
well because the ideas really had to survive
the process of arguing over them in order to
make the final cut," Atria said.
"I think our other albums were kind of ce-
rebral; there wasn't a lot of emotion in them.
This one I wanted to be a little more physical
and immediate."
And from what he saw on tour, he said
fans were well receptive to the new songs.
"I think this is our strongest effort, and
the reaction we got from the crowd when we
were on tour was the most passionate fan
reaction we have had," Atria said.
While most bands break up more than
they create new records, completing a fourth
album is an accomplishment within itself.
Atria has enjoyed the success but said
it doesn't really make sense how they are
where they stand today.
His brother Eric Atria, however, who is also
a guitarist in the band, claimed the answerto their fame was blood.
"The secret to being in a longtime suc-
cessful band is to be related to everybody,"
he said.
"[Travis] is my brother and [Stacie] is my
wife. We are on our sixth drummer, but if we
were four random strangers we would have
broken up years ago."
And if that happened, the Gainesville mu-
sic scene would just not be the same.

Art shows global events
By ALISHA KINMAN
avenue contributing writer
It is a philosophical debate as to whether art portrays life or
life portrays art. From pop-art prints to abstract sculptures of
rusty bottle caps, the purpose of art has been to provoke emo-
tion through different perspectives.
The Harn Museum recently opened a contemporary art ex-
hibit titled "Art, Media and Material Witness." Through archi-
tecture, paintings and photography, the exhibit illustrates the
struggles foreign countries have faced during decades of politi-
cal, economic and social turmoil.
"The contemporary pieces create new ways of thinking and
provoke new thoughts about the artwork," said Kerry Oliver-
Smith, the curator of contemporary art at the Harn.
The exhibit includes 25 artists from Latin America, the Unit-
ed States and Africa. Although a majority of the artists have
come from different places around the world, the message of
social injustice and the effects of globalization are very similar.
Each artist acts as "witness" to events that they have person-
ally encountered, such as the fall of the Soviet Union and the
rise in poverty in Latin America.
One of the larger pieces of artwork that
immediately stops onlookers is a set of pic-
tures mounted on neon yellow poster boardNJ hanging on thin strings to resemble a house.
E This piece by Sergio Vega, entitled "Shanty
Nucleus after Derrida," portrays the poor, ru-
ral conditions in Mato Grosso, Brazil, through
photographs of lopsided wooden shacks re-
sulting from globalization and colonialism.
"The phrase 'a picture is worth a thousand words' is so much
more expressive of the difference in the ways reporters portray
an incident compared to an artist," said Alexandria Horner, a
student at Santa Fe College. "The emotional response generat-
ed from a picture is hard to predict, but an artist can be certain
that an image stands out more to the majority of people."
Another captivating piece of artwork is a picture of two Afri-
cans posing as a sculpture. While both resemble a stone sculp-
ture with stiff body positions, they are dressed in name-brand
clothing, such as Puma. Kehinde Wiley's work, "Dogon Couple,"
represents the transformation in developing countries toward
gradually accepting popular, Westernized styles as opposed to
traditional apparel.
The artists combine different techniques in order to let the
audience decide how to react to the portrayal of an event.
"If [people] have a negative reaction to a piece, they may
feel upset or angry to think that time and money have been
spent on something they deem inferior or even offensive. This
seems to happen more often with contemporary works," said
Dixie Neilson, an assistant director of museum studies at UF.
"People also feel upset when they don't understand a work of
art; they may feel out of place and uncomfortable surrounded
with pieces that seem to be speaking a different language or at
least a language they are not 'getting.' A traditional painting in
a gold frame rarely causes the same reaction."
The artists' different viewpoints expose the audience to
global events. Through each piece of artwork, the artists remind
everyone how the world is consistently changing for better or
worse.The exhibition will run until Aug. 1.Menagerie mixes art, music

Only at Mamaw Menagerie can $5 make your heart
content.
As the clouds began to cover the sun and its rays
began to lose their heat, those with dreadlocks, nose
piercings, dirty sneakers, Natural Lights and calf tat-
toos began their journey to The Kickstand to attend
'Mamaw Menagerie'- the coolest little arts and crafts
mini-festival around.
Within minutes, my dollar bills were transformed
into a homemade bottle-cap pin; a skull and bones
necklace; a piece of some amazing carrot, coconut
and cranberry loaf; a ginger brownie; a neon painting
of an elderly person's walker; and a one-minute mas-
sage.
On Saturday, almost 20 local vendors and more
than 350 students, artists, craftsmen and musicians
came out to barter jewelry, paintings, baked goods,
scarves and ties, records turned into flower pots, deco-
rated beer pong tables, henna tattoos and more at a
hippie-inspired art fest.
The Eighth Avenue Bike and Coffee Shop providediced coffee, toneVENDOR advertised online records,
Flying Heart Jewelry showcased its homemade pieces
and George's Meet and Produce displayed its wood-
work.
"It's a festival for everyone. The elderly can come
look for trinkets, and parents can spend time with their
children.but right now we get a lot of college students
drunk from earlier activities, stumbling in who want to
see a show and listen to music," said local artist and
event organizer Thomas Callihan.
Mamaw Menagerie also of-
Ony i fered a great selection of local
* * music. This year's artists includ-
ed Ancient River, the Ex-Boogey-
men, Travis Atria of Morningbell,
Baby Rat, DJ Thomas and DJ Ernie.
One notable performance was the harmonious folk
rock synthesized sounds of Michael Parrallax, who de-
spite the 90 degree heat, chanted his songs in a fur
bodysuit before a crowd of lip-synching mosh-pitters.
The next and final Mamaw Menagerie will be held
before Thanksgiving break. Callihan will then be leav-
ing for Brooklyn, NY, to pursue his artistic career.
According to Callihan, anyone is open to continue
the Mamaw Menagerie tradition once he's gone.

Toms shoes hopes to change world with film, artists

Blake Mycoskie lives by. When he started Toms

Thanks to Mycoskie and other fashion-for-

Evans will be showcasing his designs and
creating some new ones at the free viewing of
"For Tomorrow: the Toms Shoes Story" hosted by
Society Promotions at The Exchange on Friday at
8 p.m.
"I like working with Toms shoes. Besides the
fact that each shoe goes towards helping some-

take an hour to dry, so he said he would start any
designs, but he has no intent to rush his work.
Evans owns a couple pairs of Toms, but ironically
none of his are designed. He rocks them plain.
"It's easier for me to design other peo-

With Game Day approaching this
weekend, your drive for football fa-
naticism, thirst for beer and especial-
ly your hunger for the perfect tailgat-
ing burger will shoot like a rocket into
the sky. Other than the action-packed
game with the Gators dominating,
the tailgating experience will be the
best part. Here is a homemade rec-
ipe to create a perfect, mouthwater-
ing burger on Game Day.
The Ultimate Game-Day Burger
with roasted garlic and Dijon may-
onnaise, balsamic caramelized red
onion and cabbage, sharp cheddar
cheese and arugula.
Ingredients:
Makes 2
V red onion (sliced into rings)
cup of chopped cabbage of
your choice
3-4 cloves whole garlic (skin on)
4 tablespoon mayonnaise
1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
3 tablespoon balsamic vinegar
2 thick slices of red tomato
cup of arugula
pound of ground sirloin (more
depending on how big you want
the burgers)
2 slices of sharp cheddar cheese
1 tablespoon olive or canola oil
Maxim Pettersen / Alligator
The Ultimate Game-Day Burger with roasted garlic and Dijon mayonnaise, balsamic
caramelized red onion and cabbage, sharp cheddar cheese and arugulaAdd salt and pepper for taste
Directions:
1. In a medium saut6 pan, sweat
the sliced red onion, chopped cab-
bage, and the whole garlic cloves
(with skin on) over medium-high
heat with salt, pepper and olive oil.
Cook until tender, then deglaze with
balsamic vinegar and reduce com-
pletely. Remove the garlic cloves
(to smash into the mayonnaise and
mustard later).
2. Season ground sirloin patties
with salt and pepper and rub with ol-
ive oil. Place them in saut6 pan, or on
a grill, over medium-high heat. Cook
until almost medium or medium rare,
top each patty with sharp cheddar
cheese and allow cheese to melt.
Take burgers off heat.
3. While burgers are cooking,
combine mayonnaise and mustard
with garlic cloves that were cooked
earlier. Peel and smash garlic with a
fork. Set aside.
4. Toast the buns.
5. Now let's assemble the burger
to build these delicious flavors and
textures. Spread the roasted garlic
and Dijon mayonnaise on both sides
of the bun. Add the cooked burger,
thick-sliced tomato, fresh arugula
and top with the sweet and savory
balsamic caramelized onions and
red cabbage.

Unproven veteran
receivers vital for UF
Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff
UF return specialist Brandon James is being counted on to share snaps at Percy Harvin's old position.
James only recorded 25 touches on offense last season.U DEBOSE'S INJURY ADDS
TO LACK OF DEPTH.
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator org
Florida started fall practice
hoping to have one of the wide
receivers emerge as the likely
candidate to replace Percy Har-
yin.
With this week's news that
freshman Andre Debose's ham-
string injury is worse than previ-
ously thought, replacing Harvin
just got a little bit tougher for the
Gators.
"We got some guys that need
to step up," senior wide receiver
David Nelson said. "Our main
concern on the team is depth at
wide receiver."
Of all the receivers, Debose
was the most likely to gash op-
posing defenses from the slot and
backfield.
If he is unable to play for a
large portion of the season, senior
Brandon James and sophomoreJeff Demps could see the bulk of
the touches in the former "Percy
position."
James, who has caught just 19
passes in his three-year career,
will have an expanded role in
the passing game despite being
used primarily as a kickoff and
punt return specialist until this
season.
The first team All-South-
eastern Conference return man
said that he has been waiting
his whole career for a chance to
make a difference on offense, but
he doesn't want to give up any
return opportunities this year.
"This being my senior year
and (Harvin) leaving, it's my turn
to really step in and fill the offen-
sive void," James said."We've
had a lot of depth, a lot of play-
makers. I had to wait my turn."
The outside receiver positions
are more set as Nelson, senior Ri-
ley Cooper and sophomore De-
onte Thompson have proven to
be reliable pass catching options
throughout training camp.
Cooper, in particular, has
SEE WR, PAGE 19
CSU builds program with big checks
Nobody wonders why Florida would
schedule to play a team like Charleston South-
ern.
That part is easy: to give the Gators a warm-
up game to start the year and to keep their non-
conference schedule as risk-free as possible.
After all, one loss can cost them a chance
to go to the national championship, and why
risk a hard non-conference game when they al-
ready play some of the nation's toughest teams
in their conference matchups?
But why would a FCS school like Charleston
Southern come to Gainesville to play the best
team in country, when it is well aware it will
most likely get stomped on?
In recent history, few FCS schools have
beaten one of the top FBS teams, most notably
Appalachian State defeating Michigan 34-32 in
the Big House in 2007, so why put your team
through the pain of getting routed 70-3?
The main reason these small schools put
themselves through the embarrassing losses
is the not-so-embarrassing paychecks thatcome with playing these
games.
--Charleston Southern
is getting paid $450,000
for playing Florida this
year.
Bobby Callovi The Bucs also played
Bobby's World Miami ($400,000) last
bcallovi@alligatororg year and will play South
Florida ($450,000) later
this season, bringing in
a total of $1.3 million to the program for three
games of getting manhandled.
Charleston Southern coach Jay Mills said he
is also hoping to play FSU soon.
Another trip to the bank will be needed for
that one to deposit another large check from the
Seminoles.
The athletic department has some big plans
for spending the money it is receiving for let-
ting these big schools practice on the Bucs.

Bucs grateful for chance
By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer
pkegler@alligator org
The biggest buzz about Saturday's
Charleston Southern game may have
been a point spread that never was.
USA Today's Danny Sheridan re-
leased what he expected the betting
spread should be between the Gators
and the Buccaneers.
Problem is initial reports got
Sheridan's line wrong. The sports
betting analyst has Florida as only
63-point favorites against Football
Championship Subdivision member
Charleston Southern, as opposed to
the 73-point spread some media out-
lets reported.
Still the large margin and the fact
that the Bucs are about to play the
defending champions has drawn
a lot of attention to a small school
in Charleston, S.C., which has only
3,200 students.
Charleston Southern coach JayMills said he hasn't used the point
spread as motivation, because, well,
there's already plenty of it there.
"I don't think you can add any
incentives," Mills said. "Defending
national champions, No. 1-ranked
team in the country, former Heisman
Trophy winner and
probably one of the
preseason favorites
for the Heisman
Trophy this year --
I don't think there's
anything you can
do to add incentive
or attention to this
Mills ball game."
It will be quite the uphill battle for
the Buccaneers inside The Swamp.
The result the last time the Gators
faced a FCS opponent was a 70-19
Florida victory against The Citadel
on Nov. 22.
And Charleston Southern fin-

0 THE GATORS ARE YET TO
OUTBLOCK AN OPPONENT.

The word was all over the
white board in Florida's practice
facility Wednesday -the area
coach Mary Wise thinks her team
needs to improve the most before
the next match: blocking.
Despite an impressive 3-0 start
to the season, the No. 5 Gators
have not outblocked any of their
three opponents, trailing 21.5-18
overall.
Throughout the week, Wise
has stressed the importance of
blocking, and she planned to de-
vote plenty of time in Wednes-
day's practice to working on that
aspect of the game.
"We're not blocking balls,"
Wise said Monday. "The easiest
way to look at it is just to look at
the numbers."
UF is averaging just 1.6 blocks
per set, compared to the two per
set its opponents are recording.
Last season, the Gators tallied
2.25 blocks per set, ranking 72nd
in the NCAA.
But for a team that has the po-
tential to make a run deep into
the postseason this year, Wise
said those numbers simply have
to be higher.
The Gators' middle blockers
are more than talented enough,she said, but they just need to
get back into "that blocking
rhythm."
"There are two really key stats
in women's volleyball that deter-
mine success -one is hitting ef-
ficiency and the other is blocking
balls," Wise said. "Over the years,
I don't think there have ever been
great teams that didn't block."
Sophomore middle blocker
Cassandra Anderson, who leads
the team in blocks with eight, said
the reason for the lack of produc-
tion has been mostly mental for
the Gators.
"There are two really key
stats in women's volleyball
that determine success 
-
one is hitting efficiency and
the other is blocking balls."
Mary Wise
UF volleyball coach
With a little more practice,
she said, UF should make strides
toward blocking better by this
weekend.
With four matches over the
next two weekends -including
showdowns with No. 11 Stan-
ford, who knocked UF out of the
postseason last year, and No. 3
Washington -it will be critical
for the Gators to improve their
defense at the net.
"To have it down in the next
two weeks would be great," An-
derson said. "That would be a re-ally big part of us winning."
So far this season, Wise said
Florida has yet to consistently
make the blocks it should be
making, let alone those the elite
teams make.
With improved blocking, of-
fensive mistakes would not be
quite as costly, and if an oppo-
nent keeps UF from scoring, the
Gators' defense could provide
another method of putting points
on the board.
Aside from the obvious ben-
efits of racking up points and
slowing an opponent's hitting
attack, Wise added that effective
blocking early can also change
the way opponents play the rest
of the match.
If a hitter gets rejected early
on, she could become frustrated
enough to make a change she
doesn't need to or isn't entirely
comfortable with.
Senior Kristina Johnson, who
has started all three matches at
middle blocker, said slowing
down teams like Stanford and
Washington requires getting
touches on the ball in any way
possible.
Solidifying their primary line
of defense up front would be a
huge benefit for the Gators when
facing such highly ranked oppo-
nents this early in the year.
"It's really important," John-
son said. "If we can block well,
then everything else just sort of
falls into place."Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff

blocks through three matches this season.

caught the eye of coach Urban Meyer, who
said the senior has looked better than ever in
his senior campaign.
"Of all the previous camps and previous
years he has been a Florida Gator, he's not
even close to where he's at right now," Mey-
er said. "His attitude is tremendous."The coaching staff is confident with the
top three wideouts, but Debose's injury has
also made depth a cause for concern.
Frankie Hammond Jr. and T.J. Lawrence,
both redshirt freshmen, are next on the
depth chart though neither of them have
ever played in a college game.
Nelson said the veterans challenged the
two young receivers to step up in practicethis week, but he was unhappy with the re-
sults.
"We really need them to
be consistent," Nelson said.
"They made some playsFootball (Monday). But they'll make
a play and the next play they
won't. It has to be consistent every down.
I'm going to sit down with them and try toget in their heads a little bit and tell them it
wasn't acceptable.
"They have to know their assignments.
They can't miss assignments. It's game
week. I have to trust the guy next to me to
know his assignment. There are too many
missed assignments. They need to get in the
playbook and really understand what's go-
ing on."

Debose still looking into options with injured hamstring
By PHIL KEGLER

The fate of freshman wide re-
ceiver Andre Debose will not be
decided this week.
Meyer met with Debose and
his parents Tuesday night but
said Florida's training staff is still
looking into possible options.
Debose was expected to see
playing time this season but has
been slowed by tendon damage
in his hamstring.
Meyer said the final decision
as to whether Debose will have
surgery should come early next
week.
"We're not pressed against
a timetable right now," Meyer
said. "I just walk into the doc-
tor's office, and they say we wan-
na check a couple things out and
we'll let you know."
LONGING FROM AFAR: Meyer
wouldn't mind if Jarred Fayson
was still in Gainesville.
The former Florida wide re-
ceiver played sparingly duringthe Gators' 2006 title run and
had only 12 catches for 148 yards
and three touchdowns during his
sophomore season in 2007.
After the season, Fayson trans-
ferred to Illinois for more playing
time and has two years of eligibil-
ity left after sitting out the 2008
season per NCAA rules.
Meyer called Fayson one of
the best players in the country
Wednesday.
"I wish he would've stayed,"
_ Meyer said. "He'd

be the go-to player
at Florida.

UF freshman wide receiver Andre Debose was expected to contribute right away, but he may miss a
significant amount of time this season if his hamstring injury requires surgery.

with a new athletic facility in the near future,"
Mills said. "It's going to give every sport their
own locker room, it's going to give us an aca-
demic resource center for our athletes and it's
going to help out the student body of Charles-
ton Southern, so we are very thankful for the
opportunity."
These games don't just help out financially.
They also benefit the team's recruiting.
Charleston Southern has gotten more media
attention this week than it will the rest of the
season.
It's unlikely that ESPN's First Take would
have invited Mills on its show had his team not
been playing Florida.
This doesn't mean the Bucs will steal away
blue-chip recruits from the Gators, but those
high school players who aren't FBS-caliber but
still quality players will now have heard the
name Charleston Southern and may give it
more thought when Mills starts calling.Also, the state of Florida has the most high
school talent in the country and not all of it gets
picked up by the big schools. With so many
trips to the Sunshine State for these warm-up
games, Charleston Southern coaches have
plenty of opportunities to make short drives
the night before the game to watch some high
school games and evaluate possible prospects.
While these games can help bring in play-
ers, facing the Gators can provide the Bucs with
on-the-field assistance.
Charleston Southern runs an offense similar
to Urban Meyer's spread. Watching tapes and
reading books can only get you so far when it
comes to developing an offense.
What better way to learn how a spread of-
fense should look than playing one of the pre-
mier example of it?
This game can serve as a learning tool for
Mills to improve how his team runs the spread
in the future.
For Florida, this game is just a warm up for
the rest of the season, but for Charleston South-
ern this game is what's building its program.
CSU opened 2008 season with Miami
CHAR LESTON, from page 18
ished only 7-5 last season. The Buccaneers
were picked to finish fifth in the seven-team
Big South Conference in 2009.
"We're going there with the purpose you
should have each and every week which is
to win the football game," Mills said. "That's
the number one objective every time you take
the field.
"But at the same time, this is still supposed
to be about young men and the educational
opportunities they have.
"This is an opportunity for them to have
an experience that most likely they never
would've gotten."
While FCS member Appalachian State
shocked Michigan two years ago, this match-
up appears to be even more of a sure thing.
Charleston Southern opened the 2008 season
at Miami and lost 52-7.
Still, Florida coach Urban Meyer said it is
a good opportunity to see how young players
perform in front of a big crowd in a game that
counts in the standings as well as refining ex-ecution on both sides of the ball.
Charleston Southern runs mostly a spread-
option option, and the Gators' defense is pre-
paring to see something similar to the offense
it plays against every day in practice.
"We're not taking them lightly by any
means," receiver David Nelson said. "We're
going into this week as we
would any other week."
As far the Bucs are con-
cerned, the Gators have
already helped them out.
Mills said UF's decision to
put Charleston Southern
on its schedule encouraged
Meyer other major programs to
schedule the Bucs. Charles-
ton Southern will receive $450,000 for play-
ing Florida on Saturday.
"Thanks to the University of Florida for
giving us this opportunity. We'll be forever
indebted," Mills said. "We're excited about
the additional exposure that the football team
has received. We know that the 90,000 in at-
tendance for this game is going to be unlike
anything we've ever seen before.Br
