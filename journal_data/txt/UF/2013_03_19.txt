All eyes were on the University of Central 
Florida on Monday, and UF was no excep-
tion.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes said UF has 
been paying close attention to the events that took place at UCF, which included shutting down the campus and a suicide.
“It’s something that any Florida university 
could face,” she said. “Our sympathy goes out to their campus.”
UCF’s main campus was shut down until 
noon Monday, after a dorm was evacuated, 
explosive devices were found and a former 
student died of a suspected self-inﬂ  icted gun-shot wound.
Thirty-year-old James Oliver Seevakuma-
ran was found in the Tower 1 residence hall, dead from what appeared to be a self-inﬂ  icted gunshot wound. Upon investigation, police found a suspicious device inside the building and an assault weapon, handgun and explo-sive devices in a bag in his room.
A UCF alert stated that police received a 
ﬁ  re alarm call at about 12:20 a.m. While re-
sponding, they received another call about a 
man with a gun. When police arrived, they found the victim. Tower 1 was evacuated.
The residence hall, which houses about 
500 students, was evacuated immediately. A bomb squad was called at about 5 a.m.
Jordon Halleck, a 20-year-old UCF psy-
chology sophomore, was out of his Tower 1 residence hall room when it was evacuated. It wasn’t until his friend went to drop him off that he began to realize something unusual was happening. He said he knew it was more 
than just a ﬁ  re drill when he saw police ofﬁ  -
cers with assault riﬂ  es.
At the time of interview, Halleck said stu-
dents from his residence hall were still dis-
placed and did not know when they would be 
allowed back in, despite reports that the build-ing had been cleared.

A crash in northeast Gainesville 
involving a motorcyclist and a 
school bus sent one man to the hospital Monday afternoon.
The accident happened at about 
2 p.m. at Northeast 23rd Avenue and Northeast 12th Avenue, said Gainesville Police Sgt. Michael Douglas.
Douglas said a motorcyclist, 
whose name wasn’t released, was traveling east on Northeast 23rd Avenue when he collided with an Alachua County school bus travel-
ing north on Northeast 12th Av-
enue. The reason for the crash was under investigation, Douglas said.
Emergency ofﬁ  cials took the 
man to Shands at UF. Douglas said the man was in “critical but stable condition” when he left for the hospital.
Ten children were on the bus, 
Douglas said. They and the bus driver were not injured.
A neighbor, who didn’t want to 
be identiﬁ  ed, saw the accident. He said the motorcyclist, who didn’t have a chance to slow down, hit the bus at full speed. The neighbor said the intersection is a problem-atic blind spot for drivers.
Getting a clear view of east-
bound trafﬁ  c requires nearly pull-ing into the road, he said. In the 
last two and a half years, he’s seen 
three accidents at the intersection.

Nationally renowned astrophysi-
cist Neil deGrasse Tyson will speak 
at UF on April 3.
Known for his research on star 
formation, dwarf galaxies and the 
structure of the Milky Way, Tyson 
also hosted NOVA “ScienceNOW” on PBS from 2006 to 2011.
The event, hosted by Accent 
Speakers Bureau, starts at 8 p.m. at the Phillips Center for the Perform-ing Arts. Doors open at 7 p.m. Fol-lowing his speech will be a Q-and-A session.
Tickets are free and can be picked 
up at the Phillips Center box office starting at noon on April 2.
Tyson is being paid $45,000 to 
visit UF, said Accent Chairman Josh Holtzman.
He said Tyson was chosen be-
cause he is not only a highly re-garded scientist, but he is also fun. Tyson has appeared on “The Colbert Report,” “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,” “Late Night with Conan O’Brien” and “Late Night with Jim-my Fallon.”
“Personally, I find his way of 
teaching science and talking about the scientific community to be not just informational but also enjoy-able,” the 22-year-old political sci-ence and history senior said.
Sarah Saiz is also excited. “I follow his Twitter, and I’ve al-
ways been interested in astronomy,” the 21-year-old anthropology junior 
said.

If UF student organizations fol-
low the lead of Tennessee, they 
might be allowed to discriminate based on religious beliefs.
A proposed law in Tennessee 
wants to allow student organiza-tions at public colleges to forbid people from joining based solely on their religious beliefs. The bill is an updated version of a similar one vetoed last year in the Tennes-see Senate.David Hackett, a UF assistant 
professor of religion, said student organizations governed and fund-ed by the university shouldn’t be allowed to discriminate because they have agreed to the univer-sity’s policies and make use of its resources.
According to UF’s nondiscrimi-
nation policy, the university is 
committed to nondiscrimination 
with respect to religion. It intends to demonstrate the university’s value of broad diversity within its community and its commitment to eliminating discrimination.
Sameer Saboungi, vice presi-
dent of external affairs of Islam on Campus at UF, said he finds the proposition of legislation like this to be disturbing.
“Plain and simple, it’s religious 
discrimination,” said the 18-year-old international studies freshman.Saboungi doesn’t think discrim-
ination like this could ever happen at UF because of the university’s commitment to diversity. He said Tennessee is probably more con-servative, while UF is more liberal and heterogeneous. He said even if it did happen at UF, Islam on Cam-
pus would not conform to it.
“There’s a spirit of cooperation 
and working together in dialogue,” 
he said.
Saboungi said Islam on Campus 
is not as homogenous as people think it is. The group encourages non-Muslims to attend its events.
“We don’t ban them from com-
ing,” Saboungi said.Allen Williams, campus director 
of UF Campus Crusade for Christ, also doesn’t understand why reli-gious student organizations would want to discriminate.
“I don’t know why they would 
want to reject someone who’s com-ing to learn about their faith,” he 
said.
Although he said the organiza-
tion welcomes everyone, Williams 
doesn’t understand what someone of a different religion would seek to gain by joining Campus Crusade.
“Some of this seems silly to me,” 
he said. “I doubt someone who’s opposed to what we’re doing is go-
ing to want to join.”
UF wouldn’t follow proposed law allowing religious discrimination 
It is proposed in Tennessee
“I don’t know why they 
would want to reject 
someone who’s coming to 
learn about their faith.”
Allen Williams
campus director of UF Campus 
Crusade for ChristHe said the situation has been surreal and 
is unusual for UCF. He said he is mostly just 
relieved things weren’t worse.
“The important part was that everyone was 
safe and the explosives were removed,” Hal-
leck said.
According to a Spring 2012 report by the 
American College Health Association, about 5 percent of college students indicated within 
the last 12 months that they considered sui-cide, and about 0.8 percent indicated they had 
attempted suicide in the last 12 months. 
Meggen Sixbey, assistant coordinator of 
emergency and crisis response services at UF’s 
Counseling and Wellness Center, said feelings of anger and depression are often temporary, 
and if students are feeling like they want to 
harm themselves or others, they should speak to someone.
“Talk to a family member, friend or trusted 
other and work out their concerns before you take any harmful action,” Sixbey said.

thoughts of harming themselves or others, contact the Counseling and Wellness Center at

◗ TSA CHANGES WILL BEGIN 
APRIL 25.
ELLY AYRES
Alligator Contributing Writer
Transportation Security Administra-
tion officials decided small knives and 
novelty baseball bats are safe to bring aboard a flight, but passengers are still asked to leave their water bottles at 
home.
The new changes, however, have 
some UF students and flight crew mem-
bers concerned.
Emily Tercilla, a 20-year-old UF Span-
ish and political science junior, recently flew to the Bahamas during Spring Break. She said she feels scared to know other passengers can bring knives onto a plane.
“It’s one thing if a knife is checked in 
a bag under the plane, and it’s another if it’s in a carry-on bag,” she said.
TSA Administrator John S. Pistole ap-
proved the changes that will start April 25. In a statement released by TSA, the agency said it changed its policy so TSA officials could focus on higher-threat-lev-
el items such as explosives. 
Gainesville Regional Airport officials 
and local TSA representatives declined to 
comment, citing security concerns with the policy changes.
The Association of Flight Attendants-
CWA, an organization that represents airline crew members, has petitioned online to the White House to reverse the policy. As of Monday night, about 35,000 people have signed the petition.
Brandon Macsata, co-founder and 
executive director of the Association for 
Airline Passenger Rights, said the TSA’s 
changes are based on a false premise.  
     “Weapons, or anything that could be used as a weapon, should not be allowed on a plane. Did we not learn anything from 9/11?” he wrote in an email.
Mark LaCroix, a captain of a Boeing 
777 aircraft, has flown with American Airlines for 29 years. He said he’s not 
overly concerned with the TSA changes.
“I don’t believe the addition of 2.3-
inch knives present any more risk to the 
flight crews than the extensive silverware that is already on the aircraft,” he wrote in an email.
However, LaCroix said pilots under-
stand they are the last line of defense against hijackers and said American Air-
lines has asked TSA to re-evaluate the 
policy change.        
“The first people to die on 9-11 were 
pilots, ” he wrote, “and I assure you none of us is going to let that happen again if there is anything we can do about it.” Small knives now safe to fly
“Talk to a family member, friend 
or trusted other and work out their 
concerns before you take any 
harmful action.”

Alachua County sheriff’s deputy 
Gary Boothby had finished working 
a shift before he received the call.
It was April 2010, and shortly af-
ter Boothby returned home, he felt 
his phone vibrate. He picked it up, 
not knowing that on the other line a co-worker would tell Boothby that his 17-year-old son was involved in a car accident.
“That was the kind of phone call 
you never ever want to get as a par-ent,” he said.
Brandon Boothby was in a 
friend’s car when it hit a tree in Newberry.
Gary Boothby said the doctors 
would later tell him that because Brandon was wearing his seatbelt, he survived. The driver fell into a coma but also survived.
Teens nationwide are not as for-
tunate.
A new study released by the 
Governors Highway Safety Associ-ation revealed a 19-percent increase in teen driving deaths among 16- and 17-year-olds. The increase was shown within the first six months of 2011 and 2012.
The study also revealed states 
with driving fatalities have de-
creased. Florida was part of that 
group. The state had one of the highest number of fatalities in 2011, according to the study.Florida Highway Patrol spokes-
woman Sergeant Tracy Hisler-Pace said in 2011, Alachua County had one teen driving death. In 2012,  there were four deaths reported.
ASO spokesman Art Forgey 
said the decreased deaths could be a result of teen driving programs and Florida’s graduated license 
program.
As part of the Florida Sheriffs 
Association’s Teen Driver Chal-
lenge program, the county allows students to learn how to drive in the classroom as well as on the driving course.
Florida’s graduated license pro-
gram provides stages for young 
drivers to fulfill before attaining 
their full license at 18.
Gary Boothby said social media 
could be another contributing fac-tor in the decrease in Florida teen driving deaths.
“Now that we have social me-
dia, the kids saw the car. They saw the pictures of it,” he said.
Gary Boothby said even though 
the doctors told him Brandon, now 20, may never be able to walk again, his son proved them wrong.
“Somebody tells you they don’t 
know if your son is going to make it or not — that’s just,  I can’t explain that by words. It’s just a bad, bad feeling,” he said. “And for him to come out of it and do so well ... I think it’s amazing.”Florida sees decrease

With the stroke of a pen and 
a friendly handshake, UF and 
Sears Holdings Corp. became partners Monday.
After a nationwide search, 
Sears selected Gainesville as a suitable home for the company’s first Technology Undergradu-ate Educational Partnership. The program will give UF students the opportunity to work on soft-ware development year-round for a Fortune 500 company.
Christina Shanks, a research 
strategy consultant, said the company started with universi-ties with the top computer sci-ence engineering programs. It also factored in schools’ location, cost of living and Student Body diversity.Sears representatives, UF Col-
lege of Engineering Dean Cam-my Abernathy and local officials celebrated the new partnership 
Monday at the the Ayers building on 
Southwest Sec-
ond Avenue.
The Sears’ 
Center of Ex-
cellence will be housed within either 
the Innovation Hub or the Ayers building beginning in the Fall se-
mester, Shanks said.
She said the company plans to 
take on 25 interns during the pro-
gram’s first year. The students will take part in a 10-week paid in-ternship in locations nationwide and then return to Gainesville during the school year for a 10- to 20-hour part-time paid job in the Innovation Hub.
Sears Holdings’ Chief Infor-
mation Officer Keith Sherwell 
said the program is a great way 
to bring student talent to the company.
“This is more than just an in-
ternship,” he said. “This is work-ing for us on a part-time basis.”
Shanks said the internship 
requires students to be at least a junior, have a minimum 3.0 
GPA, and leadership, work and 
volunteer experience. The pro-gram is open to students study-ing computer science, computer engineering, mathematics, statis-tics, business administration, and digital arts and media.
Students can apply on the 
Gator CareerLink website.
“(Sears) will be at the front of 
the line when students choose in-ternships,” Abernathy said.

In the last five years working 
at Silver Springs Park, Chris Cot-
ton has plenty of stories to tell 
about his time taking care of the 
park’s animals.
He recalled the time he met a 
Kodiak bear on his second day of 
work and his two-year friendship 
with two giraffes named Kimba and Khama.
But his fondest memories came 
from before he started working 
at the park when he visited Ross 
Allen Island for the venomous snake shows.
To Cotton, 33, his everyday 
experiences are instant memo-ries. But as of this year, that’s just what the park will become: memories.
As part of a deal with the state 
of Florida, the park closed the is-land on Monday as the first step in becoming a state park this Oc-tober.In January, Gov. Rick Scott 
and the Florida Cabinet approved an agreement to let Palace Enter-tainment, which owns the park, break out of its lease early and return the land to the state.
The ailing park has not been 
profitable for at least a decade, said Stan Miller, a wildlife keeper. Attendance has fallen drastically 
for the old-fashioned nature park, 
which Miller said has struggled to compete with other attractions in Orlando and Tampa Bay.
“As great as this park is, we 
just can’t compete anymore with the tourism,” he said.
The park agreed to pay the 
state $4 million to break its lease, 
all of which will be used to return 
the area back to its original state.
The park has been an Ocala 
landmark since the 1870s, but falling ticket sales and increasing 
nitrate pollution forced the state 
to take over.
Workers like Cotton and Miller are among the 150 employees that have yet to be informed of when, exactly, they will lose their jobs, or if they will be offered new jobs 
working for the new state park.
“They’re not telling us any-
thing here at the bottom,” Cotton 
said. ‘We’re all in the dark.”
Jennifer Diaz, external commu-
nications manager for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, said in an email that the department has plans to ab-
sorb only some of the park em-
ployees to work in recreation.
Other workers have searched 
for new jobs but some, including 
Cotton, still go to the park.
“It’s hard, and I’ll admit that 
there are some days where I don’t 
want to come to work because of it being so depressing, but I still 
come to work because it may be 
my last day,” he said.
For Cotton and the rest of the 
park employees, the island’s clos-
ing marks the end of an era.
“It’s an end of a lifetime,” Cot-
ton said. “I’ve enjoyed my time 
here. It’s just sad to see it come to an end the way it is.”TUESDAY, MARCH 19, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

UF is asking students to take 
an online survey to qualify to 
register for the 2013 student season football ticket lottery.
The UF Division of Student 
Affairs sent an email Sunday asking 30,847 students to take the Student Experience in the Research University survey, also known as SERU. All un-dergraduate students who are at least 18 years old can access the survey on ISIS until July 20.
UF telecommunication soph-
omore Christine Merrill, 20, is one of 1,752 who completed the survey by noon Monday.
“It was kind of tedious,” she 
said, “but it’s so worth it for the football tickets.” 
Marie Zeglen, assistant pro-
vost and director of institutional planning and research, said the survey takes about 20 minutes to complete. 
Participants will also be en-
tered to win an iPad, Beats Solo headphones and iTunes gift 
cards.
The survey contains ques-
tions about students’ personal 
and professional development.
“This is really, really impor-
tant so [departments] can be aware of student impressions and experience,” Zeglen said.
Zeglen said UF is hoping to 
set a new standard for research universities by achieving a 75-percent response rate this year.
“UNC-Chapel Hill is close, 
and they could catch us,” she said. “We’re Gators. We know how to do this.”Student experience

“Dad, you’ll be paying to support me for the next 20 years” and “Hon-
estly, Mom … chances are he won’t stay with you. What happens to me?” 
are just a few of the controversial ads featured in New York City that have garnered negative attention from Planned Parenthood locations across the country, including the one in North Florida.
Katherine Segura, the director of community engagement for Planned 
Parenthood of North Florida, wrote in an email that fear-based strategies, like the ones used in this campaign, are 
only effective when paired with sex education.
“Planned Parenthood does not subscribe to scare tac-
tics or fear-based strategies,” the 23-year-old said. “When used alone, fear-based strategies are less likely to change the occurrence of risky sexual behavior.”
Victoria Joyal, vice president for UF’s Chapter of VOX: 
Voices for Planned Parenthood and 22-year-old computer engineering senior, said the ads only target potential teen 
mothers and not the young men who could become fathers.
Victor Harris, a UF family youth and community science assistant profes-
sor and extension specialist, said it’s fairly accurate that a majority of teenage fathers don’t stay to raise a child.
Still, Samantha Evans, a UF sexual health educator with Gatorwell Health 
Promotion Services in the Counseling and Wellness Center, said it is a less effective way to prevent pregnancy.
“Although it might prevent them from having sex, it gives them an inac-
curate view of the whole picture surrounding teen pregnancy,” Evans said.Pregnancy ads stir locals

80% NOToday’s question: Were you scared by what 
happened at UCF?
Monday’s question: Do you plan to go 
to the circus?This column is written as a response to Wednesday’s 
guest column “Gender inequality is rampant in the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of America Organiza-
tions.”
Last week’s column on how the separation of genders 
in girl and boy scout troops is leading to “sexual discrim-ination and stereotyping that run rampant throughout the U.S.” hit a little too close to home for me.
As a former Girl Scout for 10 years myself — I gradu-
ated out at 18 — to see someone else say the only thing I had been taught by the organization was domestic skills was a real slap in the face.
The column talked about how even though the Girl 
Scouts organization tries to uphold the ideal of strong, 
conﬁ  dent women, the “requirements for the majority of 
their badges tend to teach a feminized skill set.”
Whoa, hold up now.In Girl Scouts, there is a badge or resource for almost 
any interest you would want to explore. Just because there are arts-and-crafty badges doesn’t mean there aren’t badges for car maintenance, geocaching, building good credit, website design — you name it.
The column also compared how Boy Scouts activi-
ties are more rugged and outdoors oriented than Girl Scouts.
Even if Boy Scouts do those types of activities more of-
ten, that doesn’t inherently make the two organizations discriminatory. If Girl Scouts didn’t put the funding or resources toward providing rugged and outdoors things to girls, that would be unfortunate and largely discrimi-natory.
But, of course, that isn’t the case.
Just because the ﬁ  rst mental picture of Girl Scouts that 
comes to mind is sweet little girls selling cookies doesn’t 
mean they don’t camp, lead hikes, learn archery, go kay-aking, climb rope courses and so on. I say that because I did all of those above activities while I was in Girl Scouts, strangely enough.
And if some little girl has an interest in baking or fash-
ion design, who is anyone to wave a ﬁ  nger and say, “You are reinforcing stereotypes by learning a feminized skill set”?
With all the love in my heart, 
screw those people.
Girl Scouts has done a fantas-
tic job of putting out resources for any interest girls have grow-ing up, so let other people read the social commentary into it if they wish.
The examples of badges the author thought were 
“feminized and borderline sexist” were misconstrued.
It turns out all scientiﬁ  c and technological badges 
don’t teach the “science of happiness.” Upon further re-
search, it turns out the example was one badge, aptly ti-
tled “the science of happiness.” Girl Scouts doesn’t shirk science and technology; it funds STEM projects like its nobody’s business, especially in the last few years
And for the “babysitting badge,” just because it is 
more useful to 12- to 14-year-old girls than boys doesn’t automatically make it gender stereotyping.
Babysitting was the ﬁ  rst paid job I ever had, and I’m 
sure that goes for a lot of girls. That badge was how I 
became CPR certiﬁ  ed at 13, so go ahead and call that not 
worth my time.
Lastly, the column made the case that to truly equal-
ize Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts, they should be combined into one organization. For anyone who is interested, they have that; it is called Venture Scouts, which is really more like a co-ed Boy Scouts. 
Otherwise, Girl Scouts are doing ﬁ  ne on their own.The important part is both organizations teach chil-
dren to be hardworking, honest, loving and ambitious. That is true equality between the genders. The rest is de-tails.
Now if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got some cookies that 
need eating. Scout pride.

Stay safe on college 
campuses, please
We, as a college society, need to be more aware of what’s going on around our campuses.
We’re a family. It doesn’t work unless we all work 
together, though. We have to make sure we’re all on the same page. It’s a cliche, but we’re only as strong as our weakest link. 
So we should all strive to take care of each other.
“Explosive devices were removed from a dorm room and 
classes resumed at the University of Central Florida on Monday, 
hours after the body of a student who apparently committed suicide was found in the room,” reported USA Today.
That’s terrifying.“The way they handled it was disappointing because it start-
ed as a ﬁ  re alarm,” said dorm resident Antionette Thompson in a CNN report. “Nobody said what was going on with a bomb 
and the shooting. So we were left in the dark.”
How did you react when you heard the news? Because it’s 
unbelievable that this was a situation on a college campus in this 
year. We should be beyond this as Americans.
“Simone Hawkins, 19, a freshman psychology major from 
Chicago, was unable to return to her dorm room after study-ing early Monday morning because Tower II was in lockdown. She said it took two hours before the school’s alert system began providing information to students. ‘I feel like they should have 
given us more information sooner,’ she said. “The only way peo-
ple found out anything was through social media, which can’t always be trusted. I just feel it could have been handled a lot differently,’” said USA Today’s report. 
While the police were on the way to handle the ﬁ  re alarm, a 
911 call came in about a man with a gun in a building.
The CNN report asked a few important questions, which 
delve into the basis of the case: “Was there a connection between the student and the 911 caller? Who was the 911 caller? Where 
did the guns come from?” 
“[We’re] trying to understand why he had the weapons he 
had,” UCF Police Chief Richard Beary said in the article.
Because he shouldn’t have had those weapons on campus. 
That’s not, like, a difference of opinion. That’s what Florida law 
states. Firearms are prohibited on state college campuses.
So how did such a stockpile of an arsenal get stored in a dorm 
room? How did no one realize someone was getting close to committing suicide?
It also doesn’t seem like the situation was handled to stu-
dents’ likings. Many news reports have accounts of students complaining they didn’t know what was going on, and in a CBS News article, student Grant Hernandez, 20, said they “were left unsure of things,” and it “wasn’t till about 6 o’clock that we got more information and a clearer picture of what was going on.”
“Obviously you never want somebody to commit suicide, 
but knowing what we know about what was in his room, we feel better at least that no one else was hurt,” UCF spokesman 
Grant Heston said in an Associated Press article. 
We agree. It should have never happened. However, we’re 
glad nothing escalated.
Go hug someone today, and be grateful.

Gators: Get out and vote
Dear Gators,
Today is an important day for all students. 
Elections for the City Commission and mayor of 
Gainesville will take place. As Gators, it is impor-
tant that we voice our opinions by voting.  
After reviewing the candidates, I am honored 
to say I fully endorse Alfredo Espinosa for City 
Commission District 4. 
Alfredo Espinosa is a prominent student leader 
on campus who would strive to make Gainesville 
better for all students.Alfredo has three great ideas that would 
significantly impact the student experience in 
Gainesville:
Stop unfair housing practices • 
Advocate for a soft closing of bars • 
Create student jobs • 
I urge all Gators to vote for Alfredo Espinosa 
for City Commission District 4 and to tell your friends and classmates to do the same.
Thank you, and Go Gators!

Given the two options, 
choose one.
Option one is your 
cute, common, everyday guy. His features are soft, and he’s always smiling. He helps you pick up the books you dropped. 
He’s friendly and kind. He asks 
if you’d like to go out to eat — somewhere other than the food court. 
He’ll most likely ask how 
you are every day because he’s genuinely interested. Stick him in the friend zone; he’ll be safe there.
Option two provides ste-
reotypical traits of what a man should be. He’s the typical at-tractive bad boy. He may not be  conventionally attractive, 
but his charm is something you 
can’t resist. His eyes are distant, and his smirk is constant. He’ll 
most likely ignore you for a few 
days, but you think you’re dif-ferent. You’re going to make him fall in love, right?
Given these two options, 
maybe you would obviously choose option one.
However, fall into your sub-
conscious, and you find yourself 
wanting option two. You clearly 
know who is the “better” choice, but what you want goes against good reasoning, and you decide 
what you want is something 
more manly.O u r 
i d e a l mascu -
line traits are em-
bedded into society and our modern mind. A man should be 
strong and distant. They don’t 
give much of anything but just enough to not leave you dis-couraged.
It is not to say we should 
generalize. Maybe these men do want to be more tender than tough, but it’s not like we would let them. As a community, we 
are taught to acknowledge a 
masculine man as the type of man we are intended to want.
These men are portrayed 
throughout different forms of 
media. This idea is a subcon-
scious need in the back of our minds.
You find women — and 
sometimes men — of all ages chase after these types of guys. They are in pursuit of someone 
who doesn’t want them. And 
it’s not to say universally men don’t want these women —be-cause they do — but the men who want them aren’t necessar-
ily first choice.
Why? Are girls plain mean? 
Are women too picky?
Maybe. Or maybe it’s because 
as a controlled community, we 
put so much pressure on girls to be perfect, we make them feel unworthy and undeserving, es-pecially to the kindness a good 
relationship can offer.
From infancy to adulthood, 
women are conditioned to be 
one thing: perfect. They see it in 
the media, among their peers, 
even within the household. Women are under constant scru-tiny. Their hair needs to be per-fect, their bodies fit, their faces 
flawless. 
Women are taught how to 
act like ladies. They are given 
the specific requirements and 
restrictions that need to be fol-
lowed in order to live a success-ful life.
In a male-dominated world, 
women face the need to please. 
This transfers deep into person-
al life.
The root of these standards 
could have possibly risen from society’s need to establish gen-der-specific roles. Men are sup-posed to act one way and wom-
en another. 
It’s a mindset that would 
take generations to change, if 
they can even change. Perhaps, as a community, we are satisfied 
with the way things are now, 
but when given the choice, who would you choose?

Speaking OutAdvertising relies on stereotypes, and it seems no matter what 
campaign society is presented with, men and women are be-ing portrayed in a gender-based concrete role. This caused me 
to question: where did these stereotypes come from? Are we shaped by the media surrounding us?  
Advertisers often use stereotypes to reiterate their message and 
to relate to their target audience. However, this further secures these stereotypes in society. It’s a vicious cycle: advertising presents men and women as they stereotypically are in society, causing people to be further influenced to not break out of the stereotyped molds of their respective gender.
The use of stereotypes is evident in Weight Watchers’ current ad-
vertising. In fact, it looks at men and women so differently that it is using two separate campaigns to target them. For women, it has have 
launched the “Weight Watchers 360” program, and for men, it has de-
veloped a “Lose like a Man” approach.  
The name of the men’s campaign says enough. Here, we already 
have this preconceived notion that losing weight as a man is different than it is for a woman. 
For women, Jennifer Hudson is the spokes-
woman. The campaign focuses on the pro-gram’s ability to sometimes allow you to eat what you actually want — those carbs or choc-
olate. It honestly couldn’t get more stereotypi-
cal if it tried.
The “Lose like a Man” commercial for men, however, takes a 
slightly different approach. These advertisements feature retired pro-
fessional basketball player Charles Barkley and discuss his love for pizza, burgers, wings and meatballs. Again, can we get any more ste-reotypical? This advertisement also focuses on the fact that within this weight loss program, men can eat any of their favorite foods and still lose weight. Of course Weight Watchers wouldn’t encourage men to 
eat healthier. After all, is a man really a man if he doesn’t eat pizza, 
burgers, wings and meatballs? 
I found this case study particularly interesting because of its blatant 
use of alternative positioning tactics for each gender. The advertising-society dynamic is extremely interesting to observe. Advertising, like Weight Watchers’ latest campaigns, clearly place genders in particular stereotyped roles, thus causing society to follow them. 
Jean Kilbourne’s documentary “Killing Us Softly” speaks about 
how advertising portrays people in the media. The problem, however, 
is she mostly focuses on the objectification, expectations and stereo-
types of women. Though women are often put under stereotypes in advertising, men experience the same type of pressure. Which aspect of this advertising-society dynamic started stereotypes first? Do media shape us or do we shape the media? It seems like no one will ever know. It’s a never-ending relationship. 
Take a closer look at the next commercial you see; how does it por-
tray your gender?

The Boys and Girls Club of Ala-
chua County won a national recog-
nition for the third year in a row for 
its local health development pro-
gram last week. 
The Woodland Park campus, 
located at 1900 SE Fourth St., an-
nounced Mar. 11 that the program 
earned the National Honor Award for Program Excellence for its Club FIT ﬁ  tness and health education program.
The program competed with 
4,000 other Boys and Girls Clubs from across the nation.
Natalya Bannister, Southeast 
Gainesville area director and pro-gram designer, said she felt honored her program took the top prize.
“Making sure kids ﬁ  nd exer-
cise fun and interesting, as well as 
learning why it needs to be happen-
ing in their life, is important,” she said. “That’s more important than the prestige.”
Keith Blanchard, president and 
CPO for the Boys and Girls Club of Alachua County, said the success of the program came with its ability to make health education and exercise fun for the children with limited re-
sources.
“The fact that we have been able 
to produce this result is impres-
sive,” he said.
The success also lies with the 
volunteers, Bannister said. In the past, UF football players went to the campus to play ﬂ  ag football with the children while nursing school 
students taught health education.
Blanchard agreed.
“The fact that the kids get to see 
up close and talk to and hang out with their heroes, it deﬁ  nitely has 
an immediate impact on them,” he 
said.
For Blanchard, the biggest im-
pact is the small changes children in the program have made, espe-cially in their eating habits.
“If they ask for a snack, they ask 
for an apple instead of a candy bar,” he said. “There are little, subtle changes with this new knowledge, 
and it’s a pretty positive change.” 8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, MARCH 19, 2013

announced it purchased a St. Peters-burg-based publishing company.
University Press of Florida, the

“Seaside helps us expand the 
kinds of books we can offer for gen-eral trade readership,” said UPF Deputy Director for Sales, Marketing and Acquisitions Dennis Lloyd.
As part of the agreement, UPF 
will continue printing 25 Seaside titles, according to a press release.Joyce LaFray, founder of Sea-
side Publishing, said she decided to sell her company because she felt it was time to retire and wanted to 
spend more time writing. She said 
she selected UPF because she was  impressed with UPF Director Mer-edith M. Babb’s latest publications on Florida’s cultural heritage, travel and food.
“I felt it was the perfect ﬁ  t,” 
LaFray said.
UPF recently started publishing 
its own collection of postcard books as well as existing cookbooks, Lloyd said.
“UPF has a wonderful legacy,” 
LaFray said, “and I knew that our ti-tles would go on, which would make all of our authors very happy.” University Press buys St.

Colleges around the country 
are taking steps to ensure real-
world experience for their law graduates, and UF is trying a multifaceted approach to keep 
pace.
More than a dozen law 
schools have shown initiatives 
to increase employment statis-tics directly after graduation. For example, Arizona State Uni-versity started its own law ﬁ  rm. 
UF, in order to provide its 
students with a variety of op-
tions, has been working to ease 
the transition from graduating to ﬁ  nding a job.Rob Birrenkott, the interim 
assistant dean in career devel-opment at the Levin College of 
Law, said now is an interesting 
time for law because there is a lot of innovation in the ﬁ  eld.
“What UF is doing is taking 
bits and pieces of different ap-proaches,” Birrenkott said.
For the past two years, UF’s 
law school has had a postgradu-ate fellowship program that al-
lows students to partner with 
entities to help underserved populations, he said. 
Students can pick where they 
would like to practice law, but it only lasts for a few months. The college is working on expand-ing the program to last a year.
Elliot Mitchell, a 23-year-old 
ﬁ  rst year UF law student, said though this program may not provide the highest paying jobs, it’s mutually beneﬁ  cial.
“It promotes community in-
volvement,” he said.
Birrenkott said the school is 
also exploring a legal residency approach for partnering with private ﬁ  rms.
Birrenkott said the law school 
is trying to make students more aware of non-traditional legal professions.
Ben Pickos, a third-year UF 
law student, said he doesn’t remember UF focusing on non-traditional legal careers dur-ing his ﬁ  rst two years of law school.
“I would have really liked 
to have been informed of more options during my ﬁ  rst couple of years,” the 25-year-old said. 
“I think that could really go a 
long way in helping people ﬁ  nd work.”Like other schools, UF law school

Students living in Gainesville this summer 
may want to steer clear of rural areas — or just 
bring a lot of bug spray along.
Phillip Kaufman, associate professor of en-
tomology with UF’s Institute of Food and Ag-
ricultural Sciences, said a super-sized mosquito 
could return to Florida this summer. Common-ly referred to as gallinippers, the species Psoro-phora ciliata was in unusually large abundance last summer after Tropical Storm Debby flooded many parts of Florida, Kaufman said.
The species, which lays its eggs in soil near 
bodies of water, may be back during this com-ing rainy season.
“The likelihood of them being [in Gainesville] 
this summer in large numbers is entirely tied to the likelihood of tropical storm systems,” Kauf-man said.
They are one of the largest types of mosqui-toes found in the U.S, he said. Kaufman said the species is “not likely to be a big problem for stu-dents” because Gainesville has a mosquito con-trol district, which monitors and investigates residents’ mosquito inquiries.
“They are just a big mosquito,” he said. 
“They’re no bigger than they 
normally are. They’re sup-
posed to be here.”
Tyler Peters, a 22-year-old 
UF psychology senior, will be taking classes in Gainesville. He said he’s not too worried.
“It’s just annoying. I’m a 
lifeguard, and I’ll be outside a lot, so I can’t really avoid it,” 
he said, adding he was first bit by the large spe-cies of mosquito when kayaking in Key West.
“I was attacked by a swarm of them,” he 
said. “A normal mosquito can kind of pass un-der your radar without you noticing, but you can really see these things.”Giant mosquitoes expected in

GatorWell Health Promotion Ser-
vices and the Counseling and Wellness 
Center launched a campaign Monday to help students de-stress to success.
The UFlourish campaign, designed 
by students for students and faculty, is hoping to remove the stigmas surround-ing mental health issues. It is funded by a three-year $296,000 federal grant. 
Sara Martin, a health promotion spe-
cialist at GatorWell and grant project coordinator for UFlourish, said stress is the leading factor affecting students’ academic performance.
Messages will be posted around 
campus about “Finding Your Balance” and managing stress.
“We hope students not only become more aware of things they can do and are empowered to seek help when they 
need to seek help, but also that we help 
reduce the stress that students are feel-ing,” Martin said.
Academic success isn’t only about 
grades. It is also about how successful they feel in their social lives, and stress plays a huge role, said Steven Snowden, a graduate assistant at GatorWell and UFlourish campaign worker.
“A lot of what college is — and be-
ing successful in college — is balance and finding a balance,” he said.
UF student Crystal Rodriguez said 
the campaign can help students.
“It’s a good idea to have these strat-
egies posted around campus because stress is a big factor, especially when most students, such as myself, are in 
other organizations and trying to bal-
ance classes,” the 20-year-old linguistics junior said.Campaign aims to de-stressTUESDAY, MARCH 19, 2013

 As Florida trailed Ole Miss 66-
63 with 4.2 seconds left Sunday, 
point guard Scottie Wilbekin had an opportunity to make the Gators’ uphill battle less difﬁ  -
cult.  
  After Rebels forward Murphy 
Holloway missed his second free 
throw, forward Erik Murphy grabbed the rebound and passed the ball to Wilbekin, who was fouled by Ole Miss guard Nick Williams to prevent the Gators from attempting a potential 
game-tying three.
  With Florida in the double bo-
nus and without any timeouts, 
coach Billy Donovan hoped Wil-bekin would make his ﬁ  rst free throw and intentionally miss his second so the Gators could try to pull down the offensive rebound, attempt a two-point basket and 
possibly send the game into over-
time. 
  But the junior point guard’s 
ﬁ  rst free throw was no good.
  Following Wilbekin’s second 
miss, center Patric Young tipped the ball out to guard Kenny Boynton, who was forced to rush a contested, off-balance three-
point attempt that rimmed out at 
the buzzer.   Wilbekin’s ﬁ  rst missed free 
throw was one of many oppor-tunities the No. 14 Gators had at the charity stripe in their 66-63 loss to the Rebels on Sunday in the Southeastern Conference Tournament ﬁ  nal at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tenn.   Excluding Wilbekin’s inten-
tional miss, Florida missed 5 of its 6 free-throw attempts in the ﬁ  nal 5 minutes of the contest. The Gators went 8 of 17 from the free-throw line for the contest. 
  “It’s huge,” Young said.“Not saying the free-throw 
shooting is the reason we lost, but it deﬁ  nitely could have changed the game. If [guard Michael Fra-zier II] hits his, I hit mine, Scottie hits his, we take the lead and it 
can make or break games as you 
see.”
  Florida struggled defensive-
ly in the second half, allowing Ole Miss to score 40 points. But its late failures from the charity stripe did not help its cause. 
  Young missed 3 of 4 free 
throws during the ﬁ  nal stretch on back-to-back plays. After Sun-day’s loss, he is shooting just 49.6 percent from the free-throw line 
this season.  
  With Florida trailing 61-59 at 
the 3:04 mark, Frazier missed the 
front end of a one-and-one. The shot was a rare miss for Frazier, who is an 82.1 percent free-throw shooter this year.

 The Gators’ frustration spilled over 
into a scufﬂ  e in the eighth inning of 
Sunday’s loss. Florida ﬁ  rst baseman Vickash Ramjit exchanged words with Kentucky’s Matt Reida after another 
Wildcats runner scored. Umpires sepa-
rated the two as coaches ran onto the ﬁ  eld to diffuse the situation. UF had plenty to be frustrated about.
  Florida (9-12) aims to get back on 
track as it hosts North Florida (15-6) to-night at 7.
The game provides not only a chance 
at redemption after the Ospreys beat the 
Gators 7-6 in extra innings in Gainesville 
on Feb. 26, but an opportunity for Flor-ida to put another disappointing week-end behind them.
  The Gators made it easy for the Wild-
cats, walking seven on Saturday. Incon-sistent hitting prevented a win in the ﬁ  -nale. Still, Florida outhit Kentucky every game during the weekend. 
  Two innings on Sunday magniﬁ  ed UF’s problem.
  Connor Mitchell led off the third 
with a single up the middle only to get 
picked off by left-hander Corey Littrell. 
Casey Turgeon singled the next at-bat. Turgeon made the last out at third try-ing to advance on a Justin Shafer hit to right ﬁ  eld. 
  Mitchell led off the ﬁ  fth with another 
single. Turgeon worked Littrell to 3-0 
before ground-ing into a double 
play on a full 
count. Florida had four hits in 
the ﬁ  fth, but could only score one run. 
  Discussion from Mitchell and Sha-
fer after the loss Sunday focused on the absence of two-out hits, but there were actually seven.
The problem lies in back-to-back hits 
occurring in just three innings.  
  “We got some good at-bats, but obvi-
ously we need to bunch them together a little bit more and get a big hit here or UF struggling to plate runnersLACROSSE

 Senior Brittany Dashiell ﬁ  nished her 2012 
campaign in Washington, D.C., as one of ﬁ  ve ﬁ  nalists for the Tewaaraton Award, which is given to college lacrosse’s top player each season.
  Though she did not take home any hard-
ware, Dashiell entered this year as a prime candidate to receive the award. But her chance of winning the Tewaaraton Award took a hit on March 9.
  The senior midﬁ  elder suffered a concus-
sion after being hit in the head by an op-ponent’s stick during No. 2 Florida’s 14-9 victory against Dartmouth on March 9 at 
Dizney Stadium.
She sat out against Lehigh three days 
later for precautionary reasons.
  Though the Gators breezed their way to 
an 18-2 win, Dashiell’s absence was felt.
  “Even though it wasn’t that tough of an 
opponent, it was just weird not having her 
out there,” senior Kitty Cullen said. “It felt off.”
  Dashiell missed practice in the weeks 
following the injury but returned as Florida traveled to face Oregon in Eugene, Ore., on Saturday. 
Despite the missed time, coach Amanda 
O’Leary expected an aggressive effort from 
Dashiell in the road matchup against the 
Ducks.
  “Brittany just makes 
those seamless transi-tions,” O’Leary said of Dashiell’s return to the lineup.
“She could probably 
take a week off, and it’s 
not going to affect her. She’s just that good.”
  Dashiell responded 
with three goals, an assist and three draw controls as Florida beat Oregon 13-5. 
  “She’s one of those players that we rely 
on and will continue to rely on,” O’Leary said.
  Dashiell has battled injuries throughout 
her career with the Gators. 
  She missed a game with an undisclosed 
injury last season and suffered a concus-sion in 2011.
  Cullen, who had a concussion last sea-
son, said the key is rest. Senior overcoming concussion

Tucker starting for Gators tonight
there,” O’Sullivan said.
Mitchell shining: Injuries and slumps have created 
a lineup in flux, and Mitchell has taken advantage.
He entered the game for right fielder Cory Reid 
in the fourth inning in UF’s 4-1 win against UK on Friday after Reid injured a rib muscle. 
Mitchell went 3 for 8 in the series with one RBI 
and two runs scored. He had the game-winning hit in a 7-6 win against Jacksonville on March 6.
The sophomore only tallied 11 at-bats last sea-
son. 
“It’s definitely tough, because you are always 
seeing a different arm. It’s never the same,” Mitch-ell said of coming off the bench. “Once the timing comes back, it gets fine.”
Simpson starting: Right-hander Tucker Simpson 
(0-1, 4.96) takes the mound against North Florida on Tuesday for his fifth start this season. The 6-foot-6 freshman didn’t pitch during Florida’s weekend se-
ries against Kentucky.
He opened the year as the No. 2 starter but fell 
out of the rotation when O’Sullivan pushed Jona-
thon Crawford back a day to make room for fresh-man Jay Carmichael at the top of the rotation.
North Florida counters with right-hander David 
Trexler. The junior allowed three earned runs in 3.1 innings against Florida earlier this season.

“With any sport when you get 
a concussion, I think it’s very im-
portant to take a couple of days and let your brain heal,” Cullen said.
“So it can shut down.”Now healthy, Dashiell will 
continue her campaign for the Tewaaraton Award tonight as No. 2 Florida (11-0) faces Stetson (0-7) at 6:30 p.m. at Dizney Sta-dium.
O’Leary is glad to have one of 
her top players back on the field 
as the Gators look to remain un-
beaten this season.
“There’s a reason she is on the 
Tewaaraton watch list, and there was a reason she was on the final list last year,” O’Leary said.
“She’s just the best of the 
best.”lACROSSE ,

Florida is 0-6 this season in games decided by six points or fewer
  “I thought that was another change in 
momentum when he went to the free-throw 
line with a chance to tie it,” Donovan said.
“We missed them, they scored and the 
lead went to four.”
  UF is 0-6 this year in games decided by 
six points or fewer.In those six contests, the Gators have shot 
62 percent from the charity stripe. Florida 
ranks 217th in the 
nation with a 68.1 
percent clip from the free-throw 
line this season.
  No. 3 seed Florida’s second-round 
NCAA Tournament opponent, 14th-seed-ed Northwestern State, has cashed in on Southland Conference teams’ free-throw shooting struggles this year.
Opponents are 62.7 percent from the 
free-throw line against the Demons — the lowest percentage against any NCAA squad. 
  When Florida faces Northwestern State 
on Friday at 7:27 p.m. in Austin, Texas, it will hope to improve at the charity stripe. 
  “Sometimes, I guess it’s just not being 
focused in on the moment,” Young said. 
“Your nerves do get to you because you try 
to not think about how big the moment is. I’ve shot many free throws with people. 
“I’ve knocked down big free throws be-
fore. I’ve missed big free throws. I don’t know. It’s just different in that situation.” HOOPS , from page 14
END OF GREGULATION
  Indiana, Kansas, Gonzaga and 
No. 8 seed Pittsburgh are the four teams in 2013 that best ﬁ  t 
the statistical proﬁ  le Final Four teams have built during the past 10 
years. 
  Unlike the rest of the ﬁ  eld, those 
four teams meet all of the signiﬁ  cant 
statistical benchmarks that most of the past 40 Final Four teams have surpassed. 
  Combing through the KenPom.
com proﬁ  les of every Final Four team since 2003 led to the unearth-
ing of a few trends. Although every 
team had different strengths and weaknesses, certain areas have, on average, proved to be more condu-cive to NCAA Tournament success. 
  Those 40 Final Four teams have 
an average offensive efﬁ  ciency rat-ing of 118.3 and an average defen-sive efﬁ  ciency rating of 88 — both 
far cries from the 2013 national av-
erage of 100.6. This is not surpris-ing. Teams that do well on offense and defense typically win games. 
  Going a step further, the num-
bers get more interesting. 
  Those 40 Final Four teams have 
had an average offensive rebound-ing percentage of 37.6. For a frame of reference, the national aver-age this season is 31.8, and a team with a 37.6 offensive rebounding percentage would rank 23rd in the NCAA. 
  The oth-
er trends i n v o l v e d s c o r i n g 
and limit-
ing easy b a s k e t s . The Final Four teams 
from the past 10 years hit 51.9 per-cent of their two-point shots and held opponents to just 44 percent. The national average in 2013 is 47.5 
percent. 
  The past 40 Final Four teams also 
got to the free-throw line and kept 
opponents off of it. Their average rate of free-throw attempts per ﬁ  eld goal attempt on offense was 38.7, while they held their opponents to just 31. The national average in 2013 is 36.  
  Part of scoring easy baskets has 
been not taking very many three-pointers. The past 40 Final Four teams have, on average, taken just 30.8 percent of their shots behind the arc. The 2013 national average 
is 33. 
  These teams have also been ef-
ﬁ  cient making those shots, con-
necting an average 36.4 percent of the time. The 2013 NCAA average three-point shooting percentage is 33.9.   The average defensive rebound-
ing percentages, turnover rates, rate at which opponents took three-pointers, tempo, experience and ef-fective height of the 40 Final Four 
teams were not signiﬁ  cantly differ-
ent from the national averages. 
  More than just matching these 
averages to 2013 teams, I wanted to use these ﬁ  gures in an elimination system. The idea stemmed from a column I wrote in November 2011. I said Florida would struggle to make the Final Four in 2012 because no Fi-
nal Four team had ever taken 44.6 
percent of its shots from beyond the arc, as the Gators did. 
  What other stats are common 
to all Final Four teams? And what 2013 teams would be statistical out-liers because their weaknesses had rarely been seen in teams that had Final Four success?
  So, I compiled the efﬁ  ciency 
rates, shooting percentages, re-bounding rates, turnover percent-ages, free-throw rates, three-point attempt rates, tempo, experience and effective heights of the past 40 
Final Four teams. 
  Then I lined them up and looked 
for commonalities and trends. For 
example, 39 of the 40 ranked 50th or better in offensive efﬁ  ciency. The next step was to look at the 2013 ﬁ  eld and red ﬂ  ag the teams who didn’t meet that qualiﬁ  cation. 
  I ended up with 17 benchmarks 
that should have been pretty easy for teams to attain. Those can be found on alligatorSports.org, in 
Table 1. Another four benchmarks 
were moderately difﬁ  cult, but had been done by 50-75 percent of the Final Four teams. See Table 2. An-other four benchmarks were in-credibly difﬁ  cult to reach, but only applied to about half of the past 40 Final Four teams. 
  Every team in the ﬁ  eld was 
checked against these benchmarks. The teams are listed down the left column of the tables, while the benchmarks are listed across the top. 
  Teams that did well — either 
meeting the baseline marks or ex-celling in the more difﬁ  cult areas — moved on to Table 4. 
  Table 4 shows each of those con-
tending teams and their speciﬁ  c stats. While the baselines are valu-able, the actual numbers are more useful in picking winners. To make those numbers legible, they’ve been 
color-coded. Deeper greens are 
good, and deeper reds are bad. But not all reds and greens are created equal. The most important stats are in the columns shaded deeper shades of yellow — these are the numbers that have had the greatest correlation to Final Four success. 
  You can take a look at the tables 
yourself, so I’ll skip to the results. For more on the squads that didn’t make the cut, head to alligator-
Sports.org. 
  Midwest: Louisville is best across 
the board, and Michigan State’s turnover issue would prove costly in a head-to-head matchup.
  South: Kansas is one of only four 
teams to meet all of the initial 
benchmarks, while Florida and 
Georgetown would be among the ﬁ  rst of their type to succeed.
  West: The possible round of 32 
matchup between Gonzaga and Pitt — the two best teams by these met-rics — is soul crushing. While the smart money may be on the Zags, 
I’ve got to go with the Panthers. I 
would be miserable if they came out of this region and I shied away from pulling the trigger. 
  East: Indiana is the easy selection 
here. Given the lack of other viable 
contenders in the Hoosiers’ bracket, I have a hard time picking anyone else to win the national champion-ship.
