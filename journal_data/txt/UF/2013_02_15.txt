Tom McNamara never left a Gators game disappointed. 
The Seattle Mariners Director of Amateur Scouting has studied players 
since 1994.
McNamara began evaluating former Gators catcher Mike Zunino since 
the Cape Coral native was 16.
The Mariners selected the Golden Spikes Award winner with the No. 
3 pick in last June’s MLB Draft, during which eight other Florida players 
found new teams.
“Every time I walked out of the park, I felt good about what I just saw,” 
McNamara said of Zunino.
“That’s rare. There were games where he hit 0 for 4, but he did a few 
things behind the plate that stood out. Then there were games where he swung the bat well. I just remembered so many different situations and so 
many different pitchers.”
Zunino led Florida to its third straight College World Series appearance 
in 2012. With Zunino behind the plate, the Gators rode a 2.92 ERA to what 
seemed like a weekly No. 1 ranking.
But with nine Gators gone to chase MLB dreams, the hunted has become 
the hunter. 
They began every game in 2012 with a target on their backs.
A year after earning the No. 1 preseason ranking, Florida starts 2013 
ranked 17th.
Florida has 14 new players and replaces seven starters after losing 20 
players to the draft during the past two years.
A fourth straight College World Series appearance may hinge on the 
play of Zunino’s replacement — 19-year-old sophomore Taylor Gushue. The Gators’ new catcher skipped his senior season of high school to enroll 
early at Florida.
He made an immediate impact.
Boca Raton Calvary Christian Academy’s all-time home run leader went 
deep on the first college pitch he saw during UF’s season opener against Cal 
State Fullerton on Feb. 17 at McKethan Stadium.
Against Miami on March 3 at Alex Rodriguez Park during his ninth ca-
reer game, he sent a ball into the third level of a parking garage behind the 
right field wall. 
Consistency and power escaped Gushue once he started Southeastern 
Conference play. For once, the freshman couldn’t hit.
He batted .143 and drove in seven runs against SEC pitching.“It was different. It was nothing I have ever experienced before,” Gush-
ue said.“Coming from high school and always having success, it’s not what I 
was used to. Coming into this year, I have a whole new perspective on how to deal with it.”
There will be no room for error from run producers like Gushue, senior 
Vickash Ramjit and sophomore Casey Turgeon with a lineup built on bunts, 
walks and stolen bases. 
“It is definitely a different feel than last year. With all the power we had 
in our lineup, it was unmatched,” Gushue said. “We have so much more 
speed than we had last year.”
There was no need to steal last season. UF led the nation with 75 home 
runs. Florida’s star power at the plate and on the mound was a rarity.
Staff ace Hudson Randall is playing with the Detroit Tigers organiza-
tion. Gone with Randall are the Atlanta native’s country twang and calm demeanor.
Lumbering Brian Johnson gave Florida a towering lefty starter and a 
power bat.
Closer Austin Maddox and his knee-buckling slider are with the Boston 
Red Sox.
Right fielder Preston Tucker and his record-setting bat are facing pro-
fessional pitching. Tucker’s legacy survives in a newly added protective netting behind the right-field wall at McKethan Stadium. Tucker regularly hit batting practice pitches to Keys Complex, the school dormitory located across the street — more than 400 feet away from home plate.
The characters from the most successful three-year run in Florida history 
are gone.
Left behind is unproven talent and gaping holes all over the field — 
none bigger than at catcher.
“We’re getting some very good players, but we are losing some as well. 
That’s the nature of the world we live in,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “When you dissect our team and what their strengths are, we can run, we 
are athletic and we are going to do that. You can certainly win.”
Gushue showed he could hit last season. But now he has to do it while 
catching a young and depleted pitching staff.
With junior right-hander Karsten Whitson reportedly out for the year 
due to shoulder issues, the Gators begin 2013 with two first-time college 
starting pitchers in the weekend rotation.
Freshman right-hander Tucker Simpson will assume Whitson’s spot, 
and sophomore right-hander Justin Shafer will pitch on Sundays.
During his UF career, Zunino handled 12 future MLB draft picks with 
ease reminiscent of another former catcher — his coach. 
O’Sullivan caught at Virginia from 1990-1991. Zunino labeled O’Sullivan 
an invaluable resource.
Watching Zunino control the pitching staff last year prepared Gushue 
for this season.
Kendall Rogers, managing editor of baseball scouting service Perfect 
Game, likened Zunino to 2012 National League MVP Buster Posey when Posey left Florida State in 2008.
While Gushue is no Zunino, Rogers sees similar potential in the Gators’ 
sophomore catcher.
“The few times I was able to interview him after games, the guy didn’t 
act like he was a 17 or 18-year-old,” Rogers said of Gushue. “That is a kind of a consistent trait they look for in catchers.”
Fifteen scouts showed up to watch Florida’s first official practice on Jan. 
26.
More scouts showed up last season for a glimpse of the Murderer’s Row 
of hitters. 
One departing player in particular leaves the most glaring void.
“You walk into the (Minor League) clubhouse and he’s right in the mid-
dle of the clubhouse basically days after he gets there, and acts like he’s 
been there for three months,” McNamara said of Zunino.
The trouble is, the nine Gators now playing professional baseball left 
behind a clubhouse at McKethan Stadium full of youth and inexperience.
They’ll get their first opportunity in Friday’s home opener against Duke 
at 7 p.m.
“Would I love to have Zunino back? Yeah, absolutely. But I’m very proud 
of who we have right now and what we’ve been able to do,” O’Sullivan 
said.
“This team has got a chance to be very successful. It is just going to be 
in a different way.”

If an asteroid half the size of a football ﬁ  eld were to 
strike Earth, it would ﬂ  atten everything within 750 square 
miles.
Today, one will come within 17,200 miles of us — closer 
than some satellites currently circling the planet, accord-ing to NASA.
The asteroid, known as 2012 DA14, will ﬂ  y closest to 
Earth at about 2:30 p.m. today as its orbit intersects with the Earth’s.
The asteroid is the largest predicted object to approach 
this close to Earth, according to NASA. However, as it travels 17,450 mph, it will almost be impossible for hu-mans to see it.
Francisco Reyes, associate scientist in UF’s Depart-
ment of Astronomy, said an asteroid of this size wouldn’t threaten the entire human race.
“We’d need something a few kilometers across to cre-
ate any sort of extinction event,” he said, “but even still, it’s no joke if it were to impact.”
Although there are ideas to divert potentially danger-
ous asteroids, Reyes said experts would need a least a few years to prepare if a large object was poised to strike 
Earth.
“If it were coming to hit in a few months,” he said, “we 
would really need to just ﬁ  nd somewhere to hide.”
Shiwangi Mishra, a 19-year-old UF microbiology and 
cell science sophomore, said she’s worried there is no reli-
able protection against objects near Earth’s orbit.
“If there are some asteroids out there that can change 
course and come to Earth, there should be plans that at least would be able to save the planet from major destruc-
tion,” she said.

As the Student Nighttime Auxil-
iary Patrol prepares to become an ap-
plication-only-based system, SNAP users at UF without a smartphone might ﬁ  nd themselves waiting out-
side for a very long time.
The SNAP UF app, available for 
download on iOS and Android, went 
live last month and will be replacing the RideCell system SNAP is cur-rently using.
University Police ofﬁ  cer Gregory 
Castronover said after the transition is complete, the only two ways to re-quest a ride will be through the SNAP UF app or by calling 352-392-7627.
With the RideCell system, stu-
dents can call and speak with dis-patch or use the automated phone service, and a computer will call students when their rides are ready . However, non-smartphone users will no longer have the ability to receive notiﬁ  cations or track the van that has been assigned to them.
“So, if you don’t have a smart-
phone, then basically, as soon as you make your request, you have to sort of stand out in the road and wait, and you don’t know how long it’s going 
to be,” Castronover said.
The van will wait two minutes at 
the destination point, as it has in the 
past, but without access to the app, users will not receive any notiﬁ  cation SNAP app frustrates some riders  Large asteroid to

Students walking around Midtown can 
breathe easier, as Gainesville Police arrested 
two people in connection with two January robberies in the area.
Rasheem Kwamaine Roddey, 18, of Jack-sonville and a 16-year-old boy now face unarmed robbery, fraud and misdemeanor marijuana charges, according to a GPD arrest report.
The ﬁ  rst happened Jan. 21, while Jeffrey 
Michael Voigt, a 22-year-old UF chemical 
engineering senior, was walking home from 
Midtown at about 1:30 a.m.
A group of four people followed Voigt 
from Fat Daddy’s and surrounded him, he said. One of the men in the group asked Voigt for his wallet and PIN. Voigt handed over his wallet and information to the group.
The next night, a group stole 21-year-old 
UF student Ryan Eugene Davis’ Samsung Galaxy S III cellphone in the same area, ac-
cording to a GPD incident report. On Jan. 29, 
Davis saw Roddey and the boy in the Mid-town area.
Davis called police, who responded at about 9:30 p.m. Police arrested Roddey and the boy, according to the report.
Police now believe they were connected 
to Voight’s robbery as well. Ofﬁ  cers charged them again Wednesday afternoon.
Police issued additional charges to Roddey 
in the Alachua County Jail, where’s he’s been since Jan. 30. As of Thursday night, Roddey remained in custody with a $175,000 bond.

Your car must be 30 years old 
or older to ride.
Ride through Gainesville, that 
is, during the second annual Hot 
Rodding for Heroes car show 
this weekend.
The event starts this afternoon 
with a golf tournament at the 
Haile Plantation Golf and Coun-try Club, located at 9905 SW 44th Ave. On Saturday , participants will drive their antique cars from Santa Fe College to the Haile Plantation Village Center. The 
tour will end with a car show. 
Adam Brown, board member 
for the event, said 300 cars par -
ticipated in last year’s event.He said he expects this year’s 
number of participants to go up.
“As with most car events,” he 
said, “most people just kind of 
decide the day or night before.”
The event’s goal is to raise 
money for the V eterans Bridge Scholarship, Brown said.
The award will go to veterans 
enrolling at either SFC or UF after returning home from overseas and receiving the GI Bill.
“When you separate from 
the military and start school,  it’s obviously a huge change of life,” said Danny Makowsky , vice president of the SFC Collegiate 
Veterans Society.
Watching the show is free to 
the public. About 10,000 people 
attended last year. 
“If you don’t own a classic car, 
you can still come out and enjoy it,” Brown said.Hot rod owners show

Methamphetamine might get 
people higher — a higher risk for 
long-term damage to the brain, that is.
A recent study on methamphet-
amine and its long-term effects questions the recovery process for addicts.
Habibeh Khoshbouei, an associ-
ate professor of neuroscience in the UF College of Medicine — along with Ashley North of Meharry Medical College and their col-leagues — studied mice that were 
induced into meth addiction, ex-
amined their behavior and looked at the activity in the hippocampus, a region of the brain involved in memory retention and formation.
The researchers studied the ef-
fects of meth on the animals and the impact on the animals’ change in behavior after they stopped re-
ceiving the drug, Khoshbouei said. 
They also wanted to see the chang-es in brain chemistry due to meth addiction.
The study resulted in the mice 
that took meth not having any changes in their hippocampal activ-ity . Their observed behaviors did not change. Researchers also ex-amined the mice after they stopped 
taking the drug.
The animals experiencing with-
drawal showed 
changes in mem-ory. These effects 
were seen two weeks after with-drawal began, which is equiva-
lent to one year 
of withdrawal in humans.
“The results tell us that when 
you treat drug addicts, you should consider the short-term treatment — if you want to give them drugs or counseling — but we’ve got to know that because of the long-term 
consequences,” Khoshbouei said, 
“they should consider addiction as a chronic disease and as a changing of biology, so we have to treat these people who are drug addicts for a longer period of time.”
Khoshbouei compared the 
changes that occurred in the brains of mice experiencing meth with-drawal to neurological changes seen in degenerative brain disor -
ders.
“The good news is addiction is 
a treatable condition, but the bad news is that exposure to metham-phetamine specifically increases risk of long-term disease changes in the memory and hippocampal activity,” Khoshbouei said.
She said exposure to metham-
phetamine and drugs in general is very toxic.
Hayley Kamin, a 25-year-old UF 
doctoral student studying devel-opmental psychology , said people have to accept withdrawal will be a long-term process.  
“You have to remember that it 
is a period, and it is going to take 
time, and you have to be willing to 
accept some of the negative or un-pleasant effects of making that life change,” she said.

Timothy Bird loves watching ac-
tion-packed thrillers and spending 
time on his computer. But he is not your average 23-year-old.
He doesn’t have a driver’s li-
cense, can’t text his friends or sing in the shower. In fact, he can’t even take a shower.
At 7 years old, Timothy was di-
agnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a disease that causes rap-id muscle degeneration in the body.
His mother, Dee Bird, said she 
didn’t know she was a carrier of 
the genetic disorder when she gave 
birth to her son.
“He couldn’t ride a bike,” she 
said. “He couldn’t climb stairs.”
Despite being confined to a 
wheelchair since age 10, Timothy graduated from Sebring High School in Sebring, Fla., and was accepted to UF in 2007.
He completed his first semester 
that Fall but had to take the next se-mester off because of his health.
When Timothy returned to school 
in the Fall of 2008, he studied to be-come a veterinarian but switched his 
major to history.
“That’s when he got really sick,” 
Dee Bird, 52, said.
Timothy was in the hospital with 
pneumonia for two weeks during 
that semester. It was then that he lost his ability to swallow, and he became weaker, she said.
Despite this setback, he still com-
pleted the semester.
“He’s brilliant,” Dee Bird said. 
“He passed all his classes with A’s and B’s.”
Timothy, however, has not re-
turned to school since 2008.
Today , he relies on a ventilator 
to breathe and can’t move his arms or legs. He has trouble talking, and when he does speak, his words are a raspy whisper.
His mother enlists nurses, like 
Valerie Evans, to come to their 
west Gainesville apartment to help 
Timothy brush his teeth, change his clothes, bathe him and feed him through a tube connected to his small intestine through his abdomen.
Evans often brings her teacup 
Yorkshire terrier, Lenny, to the Birds’ residence.
When he is not lying in bed, Tim-
othy sits in his wheelchair with pil-lows piled on his lap to support his arms. Lenny then climbs up on the pillows, lies close to Timothy and licks his face.
Although having dogs around 
the house is good company , Evans said she wishes Timothy had more young people visit him.
“I’m 63,” she said. “I’m no fun.”People with Duchenne muscular 
dystrophy typically live into their 20s, but with the right equipment, they will live to their 30s, according to the Muscular Dystrophy Associa-tion.
The Birds can’t afford the proper 
equipment for Timothy’s medical necessities.
Dee Bird said she is hosting a se-
ries of penny drives, called Pennies for Timothy, to raise money for the equipment. The first drive will be from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday at the Gainesville Mini Market, located at 7208 W. University Ave.
One item Bird needs is a ramp to 
load his wheelchair into his mom’s truck. Without it, Dee Bird said she can’t take her son anywhere without calling a van service three days in advance.
“When the doctor wants him in 
the office right now, I have no way of getting him there,” she said.

In the wake of the International Olympics 
Committee’s decision earlier this week to drop 
wrestling from the 2020 games, Gainesville ath-letes and experts are expressing concern over the impacts of the decision.
Throwing out wrestling might not only dis-
appoint viewers, but it could discourage young athletes from pursuing the sport, said Josh Wein-berg, a 20-year-old biology sophomore and cap-tain of UF’s wrestling club.
“I think wrestling is a sport that changes 
lives,” he said. “I think that kids ... won’t do it because they won’t be able to go as far as they want to.”
However, Gainesville High School wrestling 
head coach Ryland Wagner said it shouldn’t discourage young wrestlers because most are dreaming of short-term goals such as becoming a high school champion.
“I don’t feel like it will affect the kids individ-
ually across the board,” he said. “It’s very rare that you get a kid saying, ‘My goal is to be an Olympic champion.’”
Zaman Abbas,  a 22-year-old sport manage-
ment senior and vice president of UF’s wrestling club, said the decision will probably not be final-ized.
“I definitely think it’s going to be over -
turned,” he said.
Kyriaki Kaplanidou, an assistant professor 
in UF’s department of tourism, recreation and sport management, said cutting wrestling is a choice between tradition and finances.
“There’s a contradiction 
because wrestling is a histori-cal component of the games themselves,” she said.
She said the cut is partially 
to cater to a younger Olym-pics viewing audience.
The committee examined 
TV ratings and ticket sales, she said, to gauge the audi-
ence’s interest levels in different sports and found wrestling lagging. It has been short-listed with seven other sports, including karate, wake-boarding, softball and baseball, according to an 
International Olympics Committee release.
Kaplanidou said an international wrestling 
organization is taking the clue and discussing 
what needs to be done to appeal to a younger demographic.Athletes  wrestle  with  Olympic  drop
◗ THEY SOUGHT PASSAGE OF 
THE FAIR FOOD AGREEMENT.
ALEX HARRIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Rev. Les Singleton held a dis-
assembled hamburger and pointed at 
its  single, tiny tomato slice.
He was part of a protest Thursday 
afternoon attempting to encourage 
Wendy’s to pay farm workers a fair 
wage for the tomatoes they pick.
“You’d have to use a whole bag 
full of hamburgers to go through a pound of tomatoes, and we’re asking for a penny a pound,” said Singleton, a 70-year-old pastor.
Singleton and about ten others 
were at the Wendy’s on 1711 N. Main 
St., on behalf of the Gainesville chap-ter of the Interfaith Alliance for Im-
migrant Justice and the Coalition of Immokalee Workers.
The two groups sought passage of 
the Fair Food Agreement, said Rich-ard MacMaster, a retired UF history professor. He said Thursday’s goal was to push for Wendy’s to agree to the same deal other companies have.
MacMaster said about 95 percent 
of tomato growers back the agree-ment, but its success depends on buy-ers’ support.
Candy Herrera, a 27-year-old UF 
Latin American studies graduate student, said about 80 percent of all tomatoes purchased in the U.S. are grown in Immokalee.
“All the processes that go into get-
ting the food there so conveniently for you ... comes at the disenfranchise -
ment of other people,” she said.Wendy’s protestors want 
fair wages for farm work

The developers are working to accommodate smartphone-less riders
their van is there or that it waited for them.
Ashley Armbruster said the new system is 
easy for people with smartphones.
“You just use your Gatorlink to log in, and 
you can track your van through it and don’t 
have to worry about missing a call because the 
notifications pop up on our app,” the UF ath-letic training junior said. “Unfortunately , we don’t have the capability to notify people who don’t have smartphones. So, that’s a really big downfall to the system because not the entire population has smartphones.”
Kyle Rodriguez said he thinks the new sys-
tem is inconvenient.
“Even when they did call you and said 
the driver was on his way , you had to wait a while in the first place,” said the 19-year-old UF sustainability and the built environment sophomore.
Totuit, the company that developed the 
app, is aware of the issues and concerns of students who do not own a smartphone. Cas-tronover said the company is working on an upgrade to the program that will allow a text message or a phone call to notify students their 
van has arrived.
“Part of the problem is it’s a very small per -centage of the student population that doesn’t 
have smartphones,” Castronover said.
The SNAP app provides users an easier 
way to request a ride, shows where their van 
is on a map and gives an estimated time of ar -
rival.
“It’s really much more functional,” Cas-
tronover said. “It’s super, super quick and su-
per, super easy — three clicks and done.”SnAp , from page 1He’s a former UF studentWeinberg

Local artists will showcase their artwork to 
Gainesville area residents this weekend dur -
ing the sixth annual Winter Fine Art Fair at 
Tioga Town Center in Newberry.
The event will showcase about 80 artists 
from North Central Florida and will feature live entertainment and local food, said Roz Miller, public relations director for the Winter 
Fine Art Fair at Tioga committee.
“It’s a very festive weekend,” she said. “All 
we need is for the weatherman to cooperate.”
The art fair is produced by the Gainesville 
Fine Arts Association, said co-show director 
Sharon Vogel.
This year, the committee chose to feature 
local artist Peter Carolin as the first poster art-ist for the event to honor his 50th birthday, Vo-gel said.
The event will last three 
days, starting Friday from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. and continu-
ing Saturday and Sunday 
from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Miller said the art fair 
committee selects and in-vites the artists who can 
participate.On Saturday, Michigan artist Janis Madias 
will judge each artist’s showcase, Miller said. Winners will split a $2,000 cash prize.
Miller added she expects about 15,000 peo-
ple to attend the art fair over the next  three days.
“People especially like Friday night because 
they can get an early jump on their weekend activities and can stop by on their way home from work,” she said.Local artists display works in winter art fair this weekend
◗ UF WAS PREVIOUSLY 
RANKED NO. 4.

As many graduates prepare for 
jobs requiring suits and high heels, 
107 UF alumni are having experi-ences where boots and backpacks are the norm.
UF ranks No. 1 on Peace Corps’ 
2013 Top Colleges for large schools. UF tied for first place with the Uni-versity of Washington.
However, budget and contract 
conflicts have left the UF Interna-tional Center without a designated recruiter this year, said David Sam-
mons, dean of the UF International 
Center.
“We very much value the oppor -
tunity for our students to consider Peace Corps as an option when they graduate, and we would like to continue to be a major contribu-tor of volunteers,” Sammons said.
This is the first time UF has 
held the No. 1 spot, according to a Peace Corps press release. UF was ranked No. 4 last year.
There are 107 undergraduate 
alumni from UF serving overseas as Peace Corps volunteers.
“Students are drawn to Peace 
Corps for a sense of service and an interest in humanitarian effort,” said Alethea Parker, Peace Corps public affairs specialist for the Southeast region.
Chad Chernet, a returning 
Peace Corps volunteer who is now a recruiter for the organization, 
graduated from UF in 1999.“As an alumni of the University 
of Florida, it does not come to a 
surprise to me that UF is currently 
ranked No. 1 in currently serving 
volunteers because the Student Body has always put others before themselves,” he said.Parker said the recruiter previ-
ously assigned to UF did a great job. He is excited about the pos-sibilities Chernet brings to a cam-pus.
Chernet said he thinks Peace 
Corps fits well within the idea of service that is close to the heart of the Gator Nation.
“I’m certain that UF will remain 
committed to volunteer work, both internally and domestically, and is going to serve as a leader in the area of community development,” 
he said.

of the students at the

Activity and service fees: an involuntary Ponzi scheme
How many graduate students have gone to any of the 
concerts paid for with student fees? How many routinely at-
tend any of the guest speakers paid for — at least in part — with the fees?
I and many other graduate students would have loved 
to have been part, but we could not attend. As graduate stu-dents, we fulfill our graduate coursework, study for exams, compose manuscripts for submission to journals and pur -
sue research. In addition, as graduate assistants, we grade assignments, teach courses and mentor undergraduates so they obtain the best chances of succeeding in an increasingly competitive marketplace.
For those of us unable to obtain fellowships or assis-
tantships, we maintain outside employment so we can pay 
tuition, rent, and activity and service fees. We miss out on 
many of the things funded through the Student Government budget not because we have to.
There is a gross inequity with regard to the types of activi-
ties and events sponsored by SG and paid for — in part — with graduate student funds. For example, assuming funding for the Graduate Student Council came entirely from gradu-ate student contributions, GSC’s budget would account for  less than 3 percent of graduate student contributions.
It is both puzzling and problematic that an organization 
with an interest in promoting graduate student research would receive such a small share of graduate funds with the remainder going instead to nonacademic activities with little relevance to graduate pursuits. Florida law obligates SG to utilize fees for the benefit of the entire Student Body . For too long,  graduate students have paid for activities they may never use or enjoy.
As the graduate assistants’ union demonstrated the lack 
of transparency and burden imposed by fees, it is time that SG recognizes these faults in its administration. Graduate students deserve to have their money spent in better ways with increased attention to their interests, even if it means SG giving every graduate student a refund for their fees. Stu-dents should get what they pay for.
The Students Party and I believe this is a reasonable re-
quest, and we will fight to ensure all students receive effi-
cient and effective use of their student fees.
Nic Knowlton 
Senate candidate with the Students PartyQualifications still matter in Student Government
As a director for the Multicultural Affairs Cabinet, 
I have devoted my term in office to serving others and making this campus more inclusive.
In fact, all of cabinet is devoted to bringing relevant 
programming to the Student Body in order to foster growth, academically or by extracurriculars.
In order to effectively represent the Student Body 
and run the cabinet effectively, the Student Body vice president needs to have experience. 
Jenna Goldman does not have any experience in 
cabinet and is not qualified to run the cabinet. 
It takes more than a couple of weeks in Senate to 
have enough experience to lead such an important and vital part of our Student Government.
When I learned Jenna Goldman was the Students 
Party vice presidential candidate, I thought to myself about what a disservice she is doing to the students at the University of Florida. 
I was enraged at party leaders that they would offer 
up a candidate with little to no experience.
It would be unfair to the students for her to be elected 
vice president.
She is not be prepared in how to run a whole branch 
of government — let alone a single cabinet. 
Ms. Goldman has no experience with Student 
Government programming. She has no experience leading such a large cabinet. She has no experience advising directors of cabinet.
During SG elections this upcoming Tuesday and 
Wednesday,  I hope  the Student Body votes based on qualifications and experience. 
Jenna Goldman is not the best choice for Student 
Body vice president. 
A vote for Jenna Goldman is a vote for inexperience.When voting, I encourage students to look at the 
facts.
There is too much to lose if the wrong decision is 
made.

One of the biggest manhunts in recent history ended this 
week, and there’s kind of no one to claim the $1 million bounty . “He calls his rampage ‘my last resort,’ according 
to the manifesto,” said a report by CNN. This is another instance where better and more available mental health care in this coun-
try would have prevented deaths and injuries. We give a take-
a-deep-breath-everyone-and-calm-down DART to Christopher 
Dorner.
We love New York City’s mayor, Michael Bloomberg. He’s 
like our grandpa who actually cares about the country and isn’t too racist. (Don’t look at @ElBloombito on Twitter.) This week, he gave his last State of the City address. “One product that is virtually impossible to recycle and never biodegrades is Styro-foam,” Bloomberg said in his annual speech, according to the 
Los Angeles Times. It is “something that we know is environ-
mentally destructive, that is costing taxpayers money , and that is easily replaceable.” Good for you, sir! We give a maybe-that’s-why-the-rent-is-too-damn-high LAUREL to Bloomberg.
A fifth “Die Hard” movie opens in theaters this week. Could 
that, like, be too many “Die Hards”? “We are very excited about the ‘Die Hard’ marathon,” said an AMC spokesman to New York Times columnist Joe Nocera. “It will be a great time for our guests.” The company had its “security measures in place,” the 
spokesman told the New York Times. Seems like all the time is 
the best time to be concerned about overzealous gun nuts in this country. We give a at-least-the-movie-is-rated-high-enough-that-not-every-kid-will-grow-up-watching-mindless-violence DART to Bruce Willis. Maybe hang up the ol’ acting hat. Imag-
ine if Kevin James had to star in a movie called “2 Fat 2 Furious.” No one would be happy.
According to The Independent, U.S. health experts “revealed 
that an ‘ongoing, severe epidemic’ of sexually transmitted dis-
eases is sweeping the country , with over 20 million new cases 
diagnosed every year.” Gross. Really? Valentine’s Day was this week, so the number probably increased by a ton. We give a well-you’re-young-you’re-allowed-to-have-irresponsible-fun FLART to American youth. The report also said “over half the 
20 million infections were contracted by people aged 15-24.” Let’s just try to tone it down a bit, folks.
We’d like to take this time to remind you that some people 
are entirely not very honest at heart. This is about the email from 
last week. “The email in question was sent by Leah Miller, a 
liaison between the Swamp Party and its fraternity house rep-resentatives for the upcoming SG election,” said the Alligator’s report. “It asks the 25 representatives to collect ‘I V oted’ stickers from everyone in their rosters and supply the party with a $250 check.” Super squirrelly . “The email’s final lines read: ‘DELETE THIS AFTER YOU GET THE INFORMATION!! WE CANT HAVE ANYTHING ON RECORD! Sketchy, but do it! Thanks!’” Take two minutes to sit down and think if you want to elect a 
party that can’t even secretly email correctly. We give a don’t-
let-us-tell-you-what-to-do-but-also-remember-the-Unite-Party DART to some Student Government officials.

Senior forward Erik Murphy (33) attempts a pass during Florida’s 69-52 win against Kentucky on Tuesday 
in the O’Connell Center. Murphy leads the Southeastern Conference in three-point percentage.

  With a little more than a min-
ute left in the ﬁ  rst half of Florida’s 
69-52 win against Kentucky , junior 
Scottie Wilbekin passed the ball to redshirt senior Mike Rosario after 
struggling to get open. Seconds 
after getting the ball, Rosario had Kentucky’s Jon Hood guarding 
him at the arc.
Rosario then passed to junior 
Casey Prather.
The forward was already try-
ing to break past Kentucky’s Ryan 
Harrow when Hood came over to 
double team Prather. Instead of 
trying to go up over both players, Prather found an open Rosario on 
the baseline and sent it over to him 
for an easy layup.
Even though the Gators had a 
14-point lead, they were still mak-ing sure they had an open look be-fore letting one go.
“The biggest thing I always look 
for is the quality of shots,” coach Billy Donovan said. “I’m always 
looking at the kind of shots we’re 
getting. I think Erik Murphy and Mike Rosario and Michael Frazier (II) and Kenny Boynton and Scot-
tie Wilbekin, when those guys are 
open, when they have their feet set and their legs under them, I feel 
conﬁ  dent with our team making 
those kinds of shots.”
However, Florida didn’t have many shots like that in an 80-69 to Arkansas in Fayetteville, Ark., on Feb. 5. 
Midway through the ﬁ  rst half 
against the Razorbacks, Wilbekin went up for a shot while being 
guarded by Arkansas’ BJ Young 
and Fred Gulley. Although Wil-bekin made the jumper, Donovan 
wasn’t pleased with his shot selec-
tion. 
“If you don’t play well on the 
road — you know you don’t have your crowd behind you, you don’t have that environment behind you 
— it’s hard to win,” Donovan said. 
“Our guys will understand going into [Saturday’s] game (against 
Auburn) that we have to play 
well.”
After struggling with shot se-
lection against Arkansas, UF has gotten back on track. 
During Florida’s 83-58 win 
against Mississippi State on Sat-urday , UF ﬁ  nished with 31-of-59 shooting for 52.5 percent. The 
Gators continued the trend against 
the Wildcats.
On Tuesday , Florida ﬁ  nished 
the game making 49.1 percent from the ﬁ  eld. The Gators also dominated in the ﬁ  rst half from 
behind the arc. 
They made 5 of 7 three pointers 
in the ﬁ  rst half. And despite only making one three in the second 
half, Florida still made 42.9 percent  Gators aiming to maintain quality with shot selection

  The Gators traveled to College Sta-
tion, Texas, on Thursday looking to win 
their third straight game in Southeastern Conference play. 
Instead, the No. 11 Aggies showed 
why many consider them the class of the SEC and a Final Four contender, preventing the Gators from collecting a signature victory that would help earn a berth in the NCAA Tournament.  
Led by center Kelsey Bone, Texas 
A&M overcame an inconsistent ﬁ  rst half and withstood a furious rally in the ﬁ  nal minutes from Florida (15-10, 4-7 SEC) to 
earn a 78-71 victory in Reed Arena.
“It’s really frustrating,” said Lily Svete, who scored 15 second-half points. 
“Trying to dig yourself out of a 20-point hole is really difﬁ  cult. If we would have come out with a better start in both halves, I think we would have won.” 
J e n n i f e r 
George could not execute in 
the paint. She 
scored just six points on 3-of-
14 shooting while struggling on defense. 
“Jennifer didn’t give us very much to-
night,” coach Amanda Butler said. “May-be we need to mix things up again.”
Bone, who entered Thursday as the 
SEC’s third-leading scorer with 17.1 points per contest, ﬁ  nished with 31  Florida struggles in paint 
in road loss to Texas A&MEND OF GREGULATION
  Three months ago, no one knew when 
Casey Prather would begin his junior 
season. After suffering a pair of concus-
sions in the preseason, Prather didn’t play un-
til Nov . 23 — Florida’s ﬁ  fth game. 
  One month ago, coach Billy Donovan 
thought Prather’s season might be ﬁ  nished. 
During UF’s win against LSU on Jan. 12, Prath-
er came up gimpy after what appeared to be a routine offensive rebound and putback.
Donovan feared that Prather’s left ankle 
was broken until X-rays came back negative. Still, the high ankle sprain was another set-back. 
  Eight days ago, Donovan said: “We’re not 
really getting anything out of Casey right now. 
“Although he returned to the lineup on Jan. 30, 
Prather hadn’t fully recovered from the ankle injury . Donovan said Prather “has not been himself” in practice. Whether it was an issue of strength or conﬁ  dence, Prather wasn’t close to 
his normal form. 
  Now, in the wake of Will Yeguete’s regu-
lar-season ending knee surgery, Prather is a critical piece of a Final 
Four contender. Rec-
ognizing the void left 
by Yeguete, Prather accepted the challenge of getting back into form, adding more 
individual workouts 
to his normal routine. 
The results have been obvious.
  In UF’s past two games, Prather played 22 
minutes or more for just the second and third time this season. He averaged 12 points and four rebounds in the two games despite admit-ting that his ankle was still sore. 
  Beyond the stats, Prather gave UF the lanky 
defensive presence at the top of the press that is sorely missed with Yeguete on the sidelines. 
  Although he probably won’t stuff the box 
score on a nightly basis, Prather is the type of player elite teams need — an athletic, rebound-
ing disruptor.  Junior holding UF together

double of the season 
“[Bone is] very skilled,” Butler said. “She never tries to get 
outside of what she’s supposed to do and obviously takes great pride in owning that low block.”
Texas A&M (20-5, 10-1 SEC) led 34-27 at halftime and 
used a 20-6 run to open the second half. Bone scored 12 of her 31 points during the stretch.
Svete, who was held scoreless in the first half, made four 
more threes in the final 2:08, finishing 5 of 6 from behind the arc, to help UF cut Texas A&M’s lead from 16 to five with less than a minute remaining.
“My teammates just really did a good job of creating for 
me and finding me open, so I just wanted to knock them 
down,” Svete said. “I really wasn’t even thinking about it.” 
The Aggies withstood the late run with clutch free-throw 
shooting down the stretch. 
Texas A&M made its last nine attempts from the foul line 
in the final 34 seconds of the contest, thwarting what would 
have been Florida’s largest comeback win of the season.
“Just tremendous fight … they would never give up, and 
I am really, really proud of that,” Butler said. “But it’s not excusable, the mistakes that we made.”

Contact Phillip Heilman at pheilman@alligator.org.According to KenPom, the closest 
comparison to Prather based on his ad-
vanced statistical profile is Victor Oladi-
po, arguably the most valuable player on 
the nation’s No. 1 team — Indiana. 
Obviously , Prather isn’t Oladipo. 
But, as UF’s leader in steal percentage, 
the 6-foot-6, 208-pound Prather at least 
has the athletic potential to be the type 
of game-altering defender the 6-foot-5, 214-pound Oladipo is. 
Prather’s 64.1 shooting percentage 
may be unsustainably high, but the num-ber still signifies how far his offensive game has come.
While Prather’s efficiency is boosted 
by his many highlight-reel dunks, he’s shown an ability to knock down a mid-range jumper and has even hit 2 of 6 from beyond the arc.   
At only 208 pounds, Prather can’t 
guard centers the way the 240-pound Yeguete can. But he’ll make a comparable effort at the other four spots and match Yeguete’s impact on the offensive glass. 
Prather makes up for his defensive 
rebounding deficiency versus Yeguete by being a better and more involved of-fensive player. And he’s done it while 
being admittedly less than 100 percent 
physically. If Donovan’s comments from last week are any indication, Prather is still learning to mesh on both ends of the floor. 
The Gators need defensive, rebound-
ing grinders like Prather and Yeguete. With the very real possibility that Yeg-uete won’t be back, Prather is UF’s pri-
mary glue guy.
Luckily for Florida, he’s already prov-
en he can step up, and he’s only going to 
get better.

from the perimeter. 
“Guys can hit open shots on our team, I’m not worried 
about that,” forward Erik Murphy said. “I have confidence 
in everybody. … We’re just trying to move the ball and share it. Whoever has an open shot, just take it.” 
As Florida heads to Auburn on Saturday, it will be rely-
ing on Murphy’s example in shot selection. Murphy cur -
rently leads the Southeastern Conference in three-point 
percentage with 49 percent.Although the Gators (20-3, 10-1 SEC) should have no 
problem grabbing a road win against the Tigers (9-15, 3-8 
SEC), Donovan wants Florida to maintain its focus. 
“I know it sounds like a coaching cliche, but we have 
to improve from day to day and game to game,” Dono-van said. “I think that’s really important, because that is 
the only thing you can do right now. As I said before, when 
you come off a win or a loss there is always some kind of residual effect. … We are going to the next game right now 
and the only way you can get better is put the past behind 
you.”

Pitching and defense were supposed to 
be the Gators’ foundation this season.
One half of that equation took a signifi-
cant hit on Wednesday as the program an-
nounced that No. 2 starter Karsten Whitson 
would be out indefinitely with shoulder fa-
tigue.
Perfect Game’s Kendall Rogers reported Thursday that Whitson will miss the 2013 season after undergoing a procedure per -
formed by Dr. James Andrews.
No. 17 Florida begins the 2013 season 
against Duke tonight at 7 at McKethan Sta-
dium. Jonathon Crawford will start Friday 
night. The other two weekend starters have little experience on the mound at the college level. Sophomore Justin Shafer will start on Sunday, and freshman Tucker Simpson will take Whitson’s spot on Saturday.Shafer, who played primarily in the out-
field in 2012, was conserving his arm prior to earning a spot in the weekend rotation.
“I still spend most of my time in the field,” 
Shafer said on Jan. 31. “I just take it easy 
throwing wise since I’ll be pitching more, so 
I don’t throw as much in practice. I just hit, and when we’re playing in the scrimmages, I toss it in. I don’t really throw.”
Before spring practice, the plan had been 
to use Shafer in relief and call him in from the outfield as needed. As a freshman last year, Shafer threw just six innings and struck out seven batters with a 4.50 ERA. He made 44 starts as a designated hitter or outfielder. 
But Shafer was dominant in spring 
scrimmages. O’Sullivan said Shafer retired 36 of the 38 batters he faced. Still, O’Sullivan plans to continue to use Shafer in the out-field when he isn’t on the mound.
“We like two-way players,” O’Sullivan 
said. “Justin didn’t pitch a whole lot last year, because frankly, we didn’t need him to. But he’s earned his starting role.”
O’Sullivan said the weekend rotation UF 
will use against Duke is not permanent.
O’Sullivan will evaluate his starters 
through the season’s first few weeks. He hopes to settle on a rotation before South-eastern Conference play begins in a three-game series against Kentucky on March 15.
The 6-foot-6 Simpson was the No. 1 right-
handed pitcher and the No. 4 overall player in Alabama in the class of 2012.
In addition to a fastball, Simpson throws 
a curveball, a slider and a changeup. As a 
high school senior in Oxford, Ala., he posted 
an ERA of 1.89 and struck out 149 batters in just 83 innings.
“He’s around the zone,” O’Sullivan said 
of Simpson’s control. “Probably the most important component: he’s very competi-tive. He’s pitched in some big games. He’s been a guy who’s been on the national scene for quite some time. He’s certainly ready for 
this challenge.”
Simpson, a freshman, has already devel-
oped a reputation within the team.
“He’s a goofy kid,” sophomore second 
baseman Casey Turgeon said.
O’Sullivan admitted that Simpson is 
known for playing jokes but said the fresh-
man will have the right mentality on Satur -
day.
“Once you cross the white line, he’s com-
petitive,” O’Sullivan said.
