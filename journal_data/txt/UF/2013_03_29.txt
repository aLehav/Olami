CAMPUS◗ INTERNET CAFES ENABLE 
ONLINE GAMBLING.
KELCEE GRIFFIS

Online gaming at Internet cafes 
could soon be illegal, and about 30 
local businesses could be affected.
Last week, the Florida House of 
Representatives passed a bill that 
would ban paying to play games for 
cash prizes at establishments such as Internet cafes. It will now go to the Florida Senate for 
vote.
Internet ca-
fes have recently taken the spotlight after the Allied Veterans of the World chain was investigated for fraud.
State Rep. Keith Perry, R-Gaines-
ville, who voted in favor of the bill, 
said Alachua County is home to 
about 30 Internet cafes.
According to the bill, Florida law “speciﬁ  cally prohibits the keeping or maintaining of a place for the pur-pose of gambling or gaming.”
Perry said the cafes have been al-
lowed to operate in the past because they fall under a gray area in the state’s gambling law.
He explained that limited-time, 
promotional games that encourage people to buy a product but don’t require purchase to play are accept-able.

Following his driving under the inﬂ  uence arrest last week, 
Mayor Craig Lowe ﬁ  led a formal plea of not guilty in his case 
Thursday.
Lowe, who is running for re-election against Ed Braddy in 
the April 16 runoff election, was arrested March 21 after au-
thorities found him in his damaged car near the intersection of 
Northeast 21st Street and Northeast 156th Avenue.
His arraignment scheduled for April 11 was canceled be-
cause he entered the written plea. He is scheduled to appear in court April 24, according to the Alachua County Clerk of Courts.
Darby Hertz, Lowe’s attorney, released a statement about 
the decision.
“A plea of not guilty, being ﬁ  led, permits the attorney and 
the client additional time to discuss the charges, the options the client has with respect to those charges, and to conduct addi-tional investigation, if needed,” she wrote.
Early on March 21, Lowe, 55, lost control of his 2005 Honda 
Civic while driving on Northeast 156th Avenue and hit a road 
sign, according to a Florida Highway Patrol news release.
FHP trooper Javon Murphy found Lowe in his car and ar-
rested him after he “performed poorly” on a ﬁ  eld sobriety test, 
according to an FHP report.
About four hours after the crash, FHP reported Lowe’s blood 
alcohol content levels to be .061 and .069. Murphy concluded Lowe’s BAC level was more than .08 at the time of the crash.
On March 22, Lowe announced he would continue cam-
paigning for the mayoral race.
“I regret that my actions [March 21] have disappointed so 
many friends, supporters, and citizens of Gainesville,” he said in a statement. “I hope that in the future I will again prove wor-thy of the public’s trust and conﬁ  dence.”

UF students will now be able to access The 
New York Times online.
The Times changed its readership program, 
and UF students can receive a 24-hour pass to 
access the website and smartphone applica-
tion, according to an email from The Times.
The passes are equivalent to a copy of a 
newspaper.After the 24-hour period, the passes be-
come available for a new user. To access them, 
anyone with a Webmail email can go to www.myaccount.nytimes.com/edupass/claim to  
register and verify his or her email before ac-
cepting the pass.
UF receives 450 passes because that’s how 
many copies of the newspaper it gets each day, said UF Action SG Chairman Sean Quinn.
The 20-year-old UF public relations and 
political science junior said the new online ac-cess is not costing Student Government any extra money. 
According to its budget, SG paid $40,000 
in the 2012-2013 year to have USA Today and The Times on campus. 
Meg Wagner, president of UF’s chapter of 
the Society of Professional Journalists, said she thinks the new online program is a good idea 
because more students are getting their news 
online.
“I grew up holding a newspaper, and even 
I’ve gone digital in the past few years,” said the 21-year-old UF journalism senior.

UF Amnesty International and UF Students for Justice in Palestine created “The 70 Balloon

When Suhaib Harraka stepped 
off the airplane in the United States 
from Syria, he saw complete dark-
ness.
“The first thing I thought was 
‘Where are the skyscrapers?’,” the 
25-year-old said.
That was two years ago. On 
Thursday, a black balloon popped behind him.
The Plaza of the Americas was 
covered with black balloons Thurs-
day afternoon as part of UF Am-
nesty International and UF Students for Justice in Palestine’s “The 70 Bal-loons Project.”
The black balloon display was a 
visual representation of the Syrian death toll since the Syrian Revolu-tion started in 2011.Each of the 70 black balloons 
taped onto green stakes represented 1,000 Syrians killed, Harraka said.
He said he wants the balloon dis-
play to serve as an attractive way to get people informed about the crisis in Syria.
Event organizer Sameer Saboungi 
agreed.
The 18-year-old international 
studies freshman said the organiza-tion wanted to use art to illustrate the cost of the conflict.
“As a Syrian-American, it pains 
me to see my fellow brothers and sis-ters in Syria being killed,” Saboungi said. “This is the least that I can do to raise awareness.”
Harraka said “The 70 Balloons 
Project” is a symbol of hope and a progressive future.
“We hope the crisis ends,” he said. 
“Then, we can build our country.”Seventy black balloons

Easter is Sunday, and local 
churches are ready to celebrate.
The Spirit of Faith church 
will be holding an Easter event 
with a moon bounce, fire truck and free candy, said church minister Takela Vaden. It will 
be held at the Phillips Center 
for Performing Arts on Sunday at 11 a.m.
Covenant Presbyterian 
Church has planned an Easter 
sunrise service at 7 a.m. in its 
memorial garden. 
Afterward, a breakfast 
cooked by men in the congrega-
tion will be served, followed by 
an Easter egg hunt for children, said church administrator Jared Ginsburg.
“We line up chairs, and we 
get to sit outside and watch the sunrise,” he said.
Westside Baptist Church 
will host a watch party for the Secret Church Simulcast, a 
live video streaming of a Bible 
study held in Birmingham, Ala. The event will be held from 7 p.m. to 1 a.m.
“Hundreds of thousands of 
people will be participating in this one live Bible study from Birmingham,” said Westside worship pastor Daniel Morris.
Sunday’s events at Westside 
include a sunrise service at 7 a.m. and choir event at night.
The 145 members of the 
Westside Choir and Orchestra 
will be recording a live album 
as part of the event, “A Night of Praise: Live.”

Driving around the Oaks Mall 
parking lot, Garry Cooper wasn’t 
looking for a parking spot.
He wanted phone numbers.“If you were a potato,” Garry 
Cooper said from the driver’s seat to an unsuspecting pedestrian, “you’d be a sweet potato.”
A girl might feel flattered, but 
standing across the parking lot, a woman in her 70s had just heard the same pickup line.
In the YouTube hit video “Drive 
By Pickup Lines,” Gainesville broth-
ers Garry and Brad Cooper scope 
out Gainesville beauties of all ages to sweet-talk.
Some women don’t know what 
to say. Others just laugh. But most cough up their digits.
“I’d say 90 percent of numbers are 
real,” said Garry Cooper, a 19-year-old UF advertising freshman.
The brothers got their start play-
ing with editing software and mak-ing short films during middle school. Garry Cooper eventually created the YouTube channel GarryandBrad in 
August 2008. Last year, they posted their first “Drive By Pickup Lines” 
video.
“That was the video that kind of 
started it all,” he said. “It blew up pretty fast.”
With Garry Cooper telling the 
jokes and his 17-year-old brother, Brad Cooper, holding the camera, their YouTube channel had about 5.9 million views and about 76,000 subscribers as of Thursday night.
Along with the “Drive By Pickup 
Lines” series, these pranksters have also produced videos on getting women’s numbers in 30 seconds, handing out creepy notes to strang-ers and asking people, “Did you just touch my butt?”
Brad Cooper said his favorite 
prank is their “public stripping” video.
“I loved peoples’ reactions,” Brad 
Cooper wrote in an email.Taylor Hartley said she’s familiar 
with the brothers’ videos.
“I think it’s pretty funny,” said 
the 20-year-old UF recreation, parks and tourism sophomore. “Other people have probably done it before, but they were clever enough to get it on camera.”
The brothers currently have a full 
partnership with YouTube and have received offers from third-party 
YouTube partnerships.
Although the brothers have de-
clined the offers, they are open to 
the idea.
In the meantime, the brothers are 
cashing in the views for money from YouTube.
“First, we were only making a 
couple of cents a day,” Garry Coo-
per said, “but over time, it builds 
up.”
Brad Cooper said his favorite 
part of the experience has been put-ting smiles on peoples’ faces while making money.
Garry Cooper said everyone they 
prank is usually a good sport, add-ing he enjoys making videos with 
his brother.
“It’s really fun working togeth-
er,” he said. “He is pretty much my 
best friend.”

Closing local Internet cafes could boost the city’s economy, Perry said
constitutes gambling.
The cafes skirt the law by offering free 
gaming while charging patrons for Internet access.
“At Internet [cafes], you really did have to 
buy to play the game,” he said.
If passed, the bill wouldn’t affect raffles, 
limited-time game promotions or arcade games.
Although some people advocated allowing 
the businesses to stay open while imposing re-strictions on them, Perry said eliminating the cafes entirely is the best course of action.
“I personally didn’t want to put a stamp of 
approval on all of these existing Internet cafes by saying we should regulate them,” he said.
But by banning the cafes, Santa Fe College 
political science professor Thomas J. Har-rington said state and local government may miss out on potential revenue. If the cafes are regulated, he said, government could collect money from the businesses.
If residents want an Internet cafe in their 
community, he said, it may be better to let lo-cal government have jurisdiction.
“Government’s No. 1 role and duty is to 
protect society and its citizens,” he said.
However, Perry said closing local cafes 
could boost Gainesville’s economy because residents would have more available income to pump into local stores and restaurants.
“I think, long-term, it’s certainly better for 
the local economy,” he said.
Drew Sanders, a 21-year-old SFC criminal 
justice freshman, has visited the Lucky Dia-mond Internet Cafe in Keystone Heights sev-eral times.
What drew him to the cafe was the pos-
sibility of winning small prizes with small amounts of money. He also liked the atmo-
sphere of the cafe, which offered free drinks 
and snacks, a comfortable seating area and a large-screen TV.
Sanders said he thinks the choice of gam-
ing at Internet cafes should be left to residents without government interference.
“It was really laid-back,” he said. “I person-
ally think that that’s one of those things people should be allowed.”

To celebrate Peeps’ 60th anniversary, the company will be running its first TV ad in more than 10 years. 
The rebranding campaign may encounter issues because of society’s focus on health, a UF expert said.

As part of Peeps’ 60th anniver-
sary, the candy company is invit-
ing people to play a role in its first TV ad in more than 10 years.
The TV commercial features 
a brown-haired boy teaching his chubby-cheeked younger brother all the wacky things he can do with Peeps.
“You can eat ‘em, smash ‘em, 
microwave ‘em, deep fry ‘em, chop ‘em into little pieces, roast ‘em on a stick,” he raves about the marshmallow treat without paus-
ing for a breath.
Mark Hoffman, the senior 
brand manager for Peeps, said in 
a press release he hopes this com-mercial will encourage consumers to “express their Peepsonality.”
Lisa Duke Cornell, a UF ad-
vertising associate professor, said Peeps’ user-generated content 
competitions are a creative mar-
keting tool.She said user-generated con-
tent competitions reduce produc-tion costs and brain power.
“They do not have to spend on 
the commercial because the pro-duction cost is covered from the competition,” Cornell said.
However, she said Peeps’ re-
branding campaign might face a stumbling block because society is becoming increasingly health-conscious.
“Sugar consumption is a prob-
lem in the U.S.,” Cornell said. “You’ll have a problem in today’s environment when you have a 
product that is 100 percent sug-
ar.”
But Claudia Lorenzo doesn’t 
mind chowing down on the sug-ary yellow chicks.
“I feel like Peeps are a cultural 
staple and part of American tradi-tion,” the 19-year-old UF digital arts and sciences freshman said. 
“It’s necessary for a company to 
rebrand itself so that it’s fresh to consumers.”Peeps celebrate 60 years

The Bartram apartment complex 
recently donated a three-bedroom, 
two-bathroom unit to Shands Hospi-tal for Children at UF to be used by families of babies born with a rare, 
life-threatening condition.
The apartment is available for 
families of newborns with a congeni-
tal diaphragmatic hernia, or CDH, to stay in rent free until the baby is done with treatment, which can take up to four months.
Bartram General Manager J.D. 
Hatton said his complex is hosting its 
third CDH family since the partner-
ship started in December.
“It’s really something we wanted 
to get involved in,” he said. “These families are under a lot of traumatic stress when they get here with a criti-cally ill baby.”
A CDH occurs when the baby’s 
diaphragm doesn’t fully develop, al-lowing other organs to migrate into the chest, which prevents the lungs from growing properly, said Joy Per-kins, research and program coordina-tor for the CDH program at Shands. She said about one in every 3,000 newborns is affected by a CDH. 
“In the next 10 to 15 years, they’ll 
know a lot more,” she said.
Pregnant mothers nationwide 
come to Shands to have their babies treated by Dr. David Kays, chief of pediatric surgery at UF’s College of Medicine. The national survival rate for babies with a CDH is about 60 percent. Kays specializes in the treat-ment and has a survival rate of about 
92 percent.
“Here, it’s not just about the sur-
gery,” Perkins said. “It’s about how 
babies are taken care of before and after the surgery.”Bartram accomodates

Today, UF has a wide vari-
ety of dining options. But a little 
more than a century ago, stu-dents only had one place where they could fill their empty stom-
achs.
“You were here to go to 
school, and you did not come 
for the food,” said UF historian Carl Van Ness.
The original campus cafete-
ria — or “mess hall” — was in Thomas Hall in 1906. The food was cheap, and the variety was 
limited to keep costs down, Van 
Ness said.
“I assume there were a lot 
of meat and potatoes,” he said, adding student complaints were frequent. “I’m sure it was not the best food in the world.”
The dining facility moved 
in 1912 to the University Com-
mons Building. With many stu-
dents training for the Armed Forces, administrators ran UF like a military institution, Van 
Ness said.
At 6 a.m., “Reveille” played.
The breakfast line began at 
6:15, and those not in by 6:30 didn’t get breakfast.
Van Ness said some students 
would try to undermine the sys-tem, cooking in their own rooms on contraband hot plates.
“There was the occasional 
small fire that almost took down a dormitory or something like that,” he said.
Eventually, one such fire 
burned down multiple build-ings in the Johnson Hall com-plex in what became known as the Johnson Hall Fire of 1987.
Paper Celotex tiles caught on 
fire, Van Ness said, taking down the dining facility and burning the surrounding buildings of the Johnson Hall complex.
“When the fire hit that, it 
was all over,” he said.
The commons building was 
also the first place to serve alco-hol on campus. Students 21 and older can still purchase alcohol on campus at Orange & Brew.
“It’s convenient sometimes if 
you just want to relax and have a beer with your meal,” said Alex Guthrie, a 22-year old UF computer science senior.
The university added a lunch 
convenience counter in the old student union in the 1930s. Now Dauer Hall, it provided a prequel to shops of today like the P.O.D. Market.
The quality and variety of 
food has come a long way be-cause of technological advance-
ments and franchising to chain 
restaurants and companies like Aramark, Van Ness said.
Now, he said, students have 
it better than ever.
“It’s much better today, in

“Everyone knows that same-sex marriage is here to stay; in-
deed, it’s expanding throughout the country at a pace that few could have imagined just a few years ago,” wrote Jef-
frey Toobin for The New Yorker. “The Justices were not irrel-evant to the process, but they weren’t central either. They knew 
that — and so did everyone else.” His article was titled “Why the 
Gay-Marriage Fight is Over.” We couldn’t agree more. There’s no basis for any argument against allowing marriage equality. No one should be considered second-class citizens because a group of religious zealots are terriﬁ  ed of things that are differ-ent. We give a we-can’t-wait-to-see-a-more-friendly-America-but-until-that-time-we-guess-this-one-will-sufﬁ  ce LAUREL to 
the Supreme Court. Now, we realize no decision will be made for months, but even the fact they don’t want to support a na-
tionwide ban on love makes us feel positive.
This is probably not the ﬁ  rst time we’ve talked about bees 
in a Darts & Laurels, and it certainly won’t be the last. Bees are 
like tiny monsters here on Earth. A new study found, “The elec-tric ﬁ  elds that build up on honey bees as they ﬂ  y, ﬂ  utter their wings, or rub body parts together may allow the insects to talk to each other,” according to a Wired article. This suggests bees are basically robot stinging machines. Animals and electricity should not mix! Doesn’t anyone else think this is super weird? 
Shouldn’t we be concerned with nature turning itself against us, 
one beedroid at a time? Of course. We give a guess-we-need-to-invest-in-those-giant-beekeeper-getups-to-protect-ourselves DART to BEES. They already have stingers. Did they need to 
read electricity, too?!
Nelson Mandela was admitted to a hospital due to a “recur-
rence of a lung infection,” reported USA Today on Thursday morning. The article continued: “‘We appeal to the people of South Africa and the world to pray for our beloved Madiba and 
his family and to keep them in their thoughts,” South African 
President Jacob Zuma said in a statement. ‘We have full conﬁ  -dence in the medical team and know that they will do every-thing possible to ensure recovery.’ The presidency said the anti-apartheid leader was responding ‘positively’ to treatment in the hospital.” We can only hope such an inspiring leader will make a strong and full recovery. It’s sort of scary to think of what time passings mean to this world, and kids in our education system will be more and more distant from history makers. We give a 
we-wish-you-a-speedy-recovery LAUREL to Nelson Mandela.
We’ve never hidden our true feelings about Barbara Walters 
here at the Alligator. Regardless of how many trails she blazed 
for lady journalists everywhere, in recent years, she’s just be-come mildly annoying. She’s like your one friend who tells jokes really loudly that no one else thinks are funny. She’s the worst kind of friend. This week, it was announced Walters will be re-tiring in 2014, according to “an executive familiar with the news-woman’s plans,” according to The New York Times. We give a 
good-riddance-please-just-retire-and-stop-interviewing-people-
while-walking-around-ranches DART to Barbara Walters. Like, 
no offense, ma’am, but it’s time for you to stop. Please.
Have a fun and safe weekend, everybody, and Go Gators! Great Scott? No, but at least he’s trying 
Maybe it’s because I cheer for the villains. It might 
be because I’m a sucker for redemption narra-tives. It very well could be something else en-
tirely that I’m not fully aware of yet. Whatever the rea-son, I have to make a confession.
Despite being a college student, a liberal and a regis-
tered Democrat, I’m starting to like Rick Scott.
Allow me to set some basic statements before every-
one just grabs torches and pitchforks. (You can tar and feather me at the end of this column if you still think I deserve it.)
First off, I don’t trust him one bit. I’ve thought he was 
a sleaze since I ﬁ  rst saw him. His background does not inspire conﬁ  dence at all. In fact, I’m still waiting for some massive corruption story to come out and ruin his politi-cal career.
But I can’t truthfully deny that some of his latest ac-
tions resonate with me.
Although the state Legislature has the ﬁ  nal say, Gov. 
Scott pulled an about-face few expected, offering his sup-port to the Affordable Care Act. He added some provi-sions regarding his support, but progress is progress, so I can’t complain.
He also has pushed a tuition bill, referred to as “Finish 
in Four,” that freezes the tuition rate of students enrolling in state universities. That bill just passed the Florida Sen-ate’s Education Committee. Another bill that passed the committee is one that grants UF and Florida State Uni-versity pre-eminence, which gives me a slight ego trip.
Speaking of ego trips, Scott has a bit of swagger — 
and I mean the actual intended use of the word, not that “swag” and “YOLO” junk I could write ﬁ  fteen different columns on — in his actions. He wants Florida to be bet-ter braggers than Texas. I am 100 percent behind brag-ging for any legitimate reason, be it job growth, univer-sity ranking or ending a Cinderella run during March Madness.More than likely, this is 
all just to appeal to as many people as possible as we near the upcoming election season. I’m OK with that because such is the nature of politicians as elections approach. To assume otherwise invites deception.
I am reminded of a quote 
by economist Adam Smith I was ﬁ  rst introduced to in my microeconomics class. It generally applies to market behavior, but it can also apply to legislation pushed and actions demonstrated leading up to voting day.
It reads: “Every individual... neither intends to pro-
mote the public interest, nor knows how much he is pro-moting it... he intends only his own security; and by di-recting that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invis-ible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention.”
Scott is desperately trying to improve his abysmal ap-
proval rating, and in a way, he’s not even trying to hide it. While protecting his own hide, he is also supporting what most of us view as the greater good.
It is also similar to when outgoing presidents grant 
pardons. They are trying to alter their legacy so they are viewed in a more positive light as they walk out of the Oval Ofﬁ  ce for the last time.
So here’s a cheer for Rick Scott, the governor we love 
to hate.
Voldemort is probably going to be voted out of ofﬁ  ce, 
but at least he is doing some good toward the end of his run. It’s not like I’m going to vote for him anyway.

opinions@alligator.org FRIDAY, MARCH 29, 2013  ALLIGATOR, 7
Last week, Gloria Steinem spoke at 
Simmons College in Boston, where she earned a doctorate in human jus-
tice 40 years ago. After a weighty discus-sion on feminism and its place today, the 
talk turned to television.
Unsurprisingly, Steinem revealed she’s 
not a fan of “The Real Housewives” fran-
chise on Bravo.
Wait, what?! How could Gloria Steinem 
not love women who throw drinks on each other and get into screaming ﬁ  ghts about banal things like wearing fur to a party?
Well, she didn’t so much reveal it 
as come out and say, “I think the worst [shows] are the ‘Housewives’ shows, be-cause they present women as rich, pam-pered, dependent and hateful towards each other.”
Steinem’s timing is spot-on, as “The 
Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” season ﬁ  nale started this week with the ﬁ  rst part of a two-part reunion special in which the 
women rehash the major conﬂ  icts of the 
show.
The show itself is a spectacle of adult-
children, and the worst part is these adult-children have actual children.
In one episode, a woman is unaware 
her daughter is at a friend’s house because the woman most likely has a drinking problem. Despite the title, the women are 
hardly shown doing anything other than 
going on lavish vacations sans children, taking exercise classes together, going to parties and meeting up with each other to gossip about the rest of the group.
Meanwhile, on the rare occasions the 
husbands appear on the show, the men are portrayed as enjoying carefree, simple friendships — an obvious and calculated 
contrast to the women’s screaming brawls.
Steinem is correct in her assessment of 
the series. However, the show has an irre-
sistible appeal.
Although I, as well as other women 
I know, enjoy smart shows like “Girls,” “Mad Men” and “Breaking Bad,” trashy reality shows have an undeniable pull. The characters are manic, fall into ridiculous 
situations and otherwise serve to remind 
us that, even at our worst, at least we’ve never gotten into a hair-pulling ﬁ  ght at a lingerie party.
In cultural discourse, someone is al-ways quick to claim real-ity TV shows g l a m o r i z e teen preg-
nancy (“Teen 
Mom”) and hedonistic  lifestyles (“Jer-sey Shore”), or 
reality shows portray women as conniving bitches (“The Real Housewives” franchise). I have a hard time believing that. Nothing is glamorous about the lives played across 
these shows — I can’t get through a single 
episode of “Teen Mom” without feeling depressed for the girls, especially because all of them are expecting more children.
Same with “Jersey Shore” and “The 
Real Housewives”: Their lives are so de-pressingly empty, void of fulﬁ  llment or real friendships or satisfying relationships. They exist in a manipulated reality, and 
there’s nothing glamorous about that.
A study published in Psychology To-
day revealed participants in a survey who 
said they enjoyed intellectual activities are no less likely to watch reality TV than the participants who said they didn’t enjoy in-tellectual activities.
In a different article on reality TV also 
published in Psychology Today, the author 
admits she is a “reality TV aﬁ  cionado.”
The writer, Melanie Greenberg, said, 
“Being hardworking and self-disciplined 
in my own life, I enjoy the escape into fan-tasy and melodrama at the end of the day, as well as the rags to riches stories, over the top diva antics, glamorous lifestyles, and mean girls (and boys) shenanigans. As an expert on life stress, emotion and human 
behavior, my brain gets a workout trying 
to explain these theatrics in the light of psy-chological theory and research.”
The common response I’ve heard when 
asking friends why they watch reality shows, and the response I am quick to give, is they watch for the entertainment value and a brief self-esteem boost.
The characters in the shows are paro-
dies, and their dramas and conﬂ  icts are superﬁ  cial.

Neil deGrasse Tyson will be speak-
ing on campus Wednesday. Al-though many know Tyson as an 
astronomer and science popularizer, some 
of us know him as something more than 
that.
Some of us recognize Tyson as the suc-
cessor to Carl Sagan.
Who is Carl Sagan? Sagan was an as-
tronomer. His words have changed lives, 
including my own.
He made a series, “Cosmos: A Personal 
Voyage,” in which the viewer is taken on a 
journey through the universe. For me, the series was quite a learning experience.
Sagan says the cosmos is within our 
own bodies. “We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.”
Tyson regularly expresses his excite-
ment and passion for such ideas. He’s even making a sequel series to the original “Cos-mos” with Ann Druyan, Sagan’s widow, who helped write the original series.
I look forward to watching Tyson’s new 
“Cosmos” when it airs on Fox in 2014, and I hope anyone reading this will be curious enough to watch the original “Cosmos.”
In honor of Tyson’s visit, I wish to 
spend the remainder of this column on an excerpt from Sagan’s book “Pale Blue Dot: 
A Vision of the Human Future in Space.” 
Sagan wrote these words when reﬂ  ecting on an image of Earth taken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft from Saturn. These words in-
spire me, and I hope you will be inspired, 
too.
“From this distant vantage point, the 
Earth might not seem of particular interest. 
But for us, it’s different. Consider again that dot. That’s here. That’s home. That’s us. On 
it everyone you love, everyone you know, 
everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of conﬁ  dent religions, ideolo-
gies, and economic doctrines, every hunter 
and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, ev-ery king and peasant, every young couple 
in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher 
of morals, every corrupt politician, every ‘superstar,’ every ‘supreme leader,’ every 
saint and sinner in the history of our species 
lived there – on a mote of dust suspended 
in a sunbeam.
The Earth is a very small stage in a vast 
cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that in glory and triumph they could be-
come the momentary masters of a fraction 
of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties vis-ited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhab-itants of some other corner. How frequent 
their misunder-standings, how eager they are to kill one another, 
how fervent 
their hatreds. Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, 
the delusion that 
we have some 
privileged position in the universe, are 
challenged by this point of pale light. Our 
planet is a lonely speck in the great envel-oping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all 
this vastness, there is no hint that help will 
come from elsewhere to save us from our-selves.”
“The Earth is the only world known, so 
far, to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at 
least in the near future, to which our spe-
cies could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. 
Like it or not, for the moment, the Earth is where we make our stand. It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and charac-
ter-building experience. There is perhaps no 
better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsi-bility to deal more kindly with one another 
and to preserve and cherish the pale blue 
dot, the only home we’ve ever known.”

She broke the rules and snuck into her 
first R-rated movie when she was 14 years 
old.
She got away with it.Rachelle Gabrang, now a 20-year-old UF 
accounting sophomore, is not unlike many others who rebelled against entertainment 
ratings in their teens.
“If I want to see the movie, the laws 
don’t really hinder me from going in,” 
she said. “I don’t see any wrong with it, ethically.”
But movie theaters are beginning to 
crack down.  
On Monday, the Federal Trade 
Commission released the results of an undercover shopper survey about entertainment ratings enforcement.  
“Only 13 percent of underage shoppers 
were able to purchase M-rated video games, while a historic low of 24 percent were able to purchase tickets to R-rated movies,” according to the FTC press release.Between April and June 2012, 
unaccompanied 13- to 16-year-olds attempted to purchase R-rated movie 
tickets, music CDs with parental advisory 
labels, video games rated M and unrated DVDs that were once rated R.
Rick Quaresima, assistant director for 
advertising practices with the FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection, said the secret shopper program began in 2000 after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.
Terry Harpold, associate professor for 
the UF Department of English, said he does not expose his 10-year-old daughter to violent forms of entertainment media because she “doesn’t have the time and experience” of an adult.
“They’re laws,” he said.  “They should 
be enforced.”Viewers can’t sneak in under, undercover program discovers� ABOUT 600 PEOPLE ARE

UF’s first university-wide Holi 
— Festival of Colors will be held 
Saturday from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Hume Field.
Holi, an Indian tradition celebrating spring by throwing colored powder, is being held at UF to expose students to a different culture and promote education, said Henna Ibrahim, the student coordinator for UF Holi.
“We want students to learn about 
this important Indian tradition in an active way — not through 
a pamphlet or lecture,” said the 
21-year-old UF food science and human nutrition senior.All people are encouraged to 
attend, share in the fun and wear white.
“In India, Holi is the day 
that differences in caste, creed, socioeconomic status and all the other components that can divide communities is forsaken,” Ibrahim said. “People leave the event the same way — covered in color and with a smile.”
About 600 people are expected 
to attend the event, which will feature free food from the Hare Krishnas starting at 1 p.m. and the 
color celebration at 2 p.m. 
Swamp Fitness will be raffling 
personal training and yoga classes to participants.
Rana Sayroo, the director for 
UF’s Indian Student Association, 
said participating in Holi is a great experience.
“It’s just amazing to see everyone 
having fun throwing powder at each other, and it creates unity,” said the 19-year-old UF biology 
sophomore. “Everyone comes to 
Holi looking different, but we all leave looking the same.”

  At 6:35 p.m. on Monday, a new rivalry was born. 
  After upsetting No. 2 seed Georgetown and No. 7 seed 
San Diego State for a spot in the Sweet 16 and catapult-ing into the national spotlight, 15th-seeded Florida Gulf Coast held a pep rally in its on-campus arena. The event, 
which saw thousands of FGCU fans in the stands, was 
broadcast live on ESPN.  
  “We play one of the best teams in the country Friday 
night,” FGCU coach Andy Enfi  eld said to the crowd, re-ferring to Florida. 
  After boos poured in, vulgarity ensued.    “F--k the Gators,” the students chanted, as Enfi  eld tried 
to laugh it off.
  A week ago, nobody would have expected Florida Gulf 
Coast to make it this far in the NCAA Tournament. But tonight at 10:07 in Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, the third-seeded Gators (28-7) will square off against the No. 15 seed Eagles (26-10) in the South Region semifi  nals for a spot in the Elite Eight. 
  “The country may give a team a label, but we never do 
that,” said Florida coach Billy Donovan, who has coached at UF for 17 years — six years longer than FGCU has fi  eld-ed a men’s basketball team.
  “We look at a team on fi  lm and what they do and the 
things that we have to do, so we’ve got to prepare for this game like we would any other game. This is a really good team… that is maybe playing as well as anyone in the country right now. The seeding and all that stuff, it doesn’t mean anything.”
  As the fi  rst No. 15 seed to ever advance to the Sweet 16, 
FGCU has attracted widespread national media attention. The Eagles won their games against the Hoyas and Aztecs 
by 10 points. 
  Because of the fast-paced, acrobatic style of basketball 
the Eagles play, Florida Gulf Coast has earned the nick-
name “Dunk City.”
  “Obviously they’re really athletic across the front line, 
but my dad always told me a dunk’s worth two points,” senior forward Erik Murphy said. “Those plays energize them, though, so we want to try to limit them.”
  FGCU has attracted the majority of national coverage 
this week, despite another Cinderella, No. 13 seed La Salle, advancing to the Sweet 16. The fact that most of the nation will be rooting for the underdog Friday night does 
not bother guard Scottie Wilbekin.

  After missing the past six games, ju-
nior Vicky McIntyre’s future with the 
Gators is in question. 
  The 6-foot-7 center last suited up for 
Florida during a 69-58 victory against 
Arkansas on Feb. 28 in the O’Connell 
Center. She 
did not play in the Southeast-ern Conference t o u r n a m e n t and has not 
traveled with UF during the WNIT.
  “[McIntyre] had to take a break for 
some personal reasons,” coach Amanda Butler said. “That’s really about all I can tell you right now.”
  Asked if McIntyre was expected to 
rejoin the team next season, Butler was equally noncommittal. 
  “I hope so,” she said. “I don’t have 
any reason to anticipate anything differ-ent than that right now.” 
  McIntyre transferred to Florida dur-
ing the offseason after spending two sea-sons at Oklahoma State. In 29 games, she averaged 4.8 points and 3.8 rebounds 
while logging 13.5 minutes per contest. 
  
  Freshman performing: The Gators have 
relied heavily on freshmen to make their deepest run in the WNIT since reaching the championship game in 2000. 
  Florida will travel to Harrisonburg, 
Virginia, to face James Madison (25-10) at the JMU Convocation Center in the 
Elite Eight on Saturday at 4 p.m.
  But without freshman January Mill-
er, the Gators likely would be headed 
home.  Junior center not with team

You’re not ready.
The Sweet 16 just tipped off, and 
you’re already dreaming of Florida 
reaching its fi  rst Final Four since 2007. It’s un-
derstandable.
I have UF going all the way in my bracket.What the hell is a No. 15 seed doing in the 
South Regional semifi  nal of the NCAA Tourna-ment? It’s just not right.
But before you start thinking about Michi-
gan or Kansas, just wait a second. Maybe Florida Gulf Coast really is all that and a bag of 
chips. And a Happy Meal toy.
Here are eight things that make me think 
that maybe — just maybe — the Eagles will 
send the Gators home and advance to the Elite Eight.
- Dunk City: You saw this coming. Just 
watch the video on Deadspin.
- Swish City: FGCU is America’s darling, 
and the Eagles’ high-fl  ying dunks are the ic-
ing on the cake. But FGCU has been scorching 
opponents from all over the fl  oor. During their past three halves, the Eagles have scored 135 points on 56.1 percent shooting. Georgetown ranks sixth in the na-tion with a 37.8 per-cent opponent fi  eld 
goal percentage. San 
Diego State is 33rd at 39.3 percent. When FGCU’s fast-paced of-
fense is on fi  re, it’s diffi  cult to stop.
- Geniusville: Thomas Edison and Henry 
Ford used to own neighboring estates in Fort 
Myers. FGCU is in Fort Myers. Maybe the Ea-
gles will invent a way to upset the Gators. How about a bottle of Michael’s Secret Stuff?
- Dissension among the ranks?: Florida cor-
nerback Jaylen Watkins got into a little trouble on Twitter this week when the Fort Myers na-tive decided to show some love for his home-town team. He clarifi  ed his comments by say-ing he supports the Gators “1000 percent,” but 
he remains neutral.

Following a 16-point performance in Florida’s 85-53 
victory against Winthrop in the second round of the WNIT 
on Monday, Miller was quiet against Charlotte for much of Wednesday night’s game. 
But with less than a minute remaining in the second 
half, the freshman guard ignited a quick comeback that propelled the Gators into the Elite Eight. 
After Charlotte junior guard Ny Hammonds sank a 
jumper to give the 49ers a 65-61 advantage with 1:05 left in the contest, Miller took a pass from Christin Mercer and connected on her only three-pointer of the game with 52 seconds remaining. 
The shot sliced the Gators’ deficit to 65-64 and snapped 
a scoreless span of 3:12. 
“I just came off the screen and instead of going off and 
doing my normal mid-range, I pulled up for a three, and it went in,” Miller said. “It was crazy.”
Mercer then intercepted a pass on Charlotte’s ensuing 
possession, and Jaterra Bonds scored the final three points of the game to help UF (21-14) escape with a 67-65 win.
“[January] has played so big and hit such big shots in 
so many big games that we weren’t surprised by it,” Butler said. “Of course we were elated, and it instantly changed 
our positioning. It was just a huge, huge shot that really set 
up everything else that happened from that point on.”
The play of UF’s freshmen has been equally important. While Miller has averaged 8.7 points through three 
WNIT games, guard Sydney Moss has scored 17 points and grabbed 8.7 rebounds per contest. 
Mercer and Carlie Needles have led a defense that has 
forced 16.3 turnovers per game in the WNIT. 
“I’ve been really proud of that crew,” Butler said. “That’s 
why we brought them here, and that’s why they chose to come here, to be difference-makers in big games.”

rooting for FGCU... I am supporting 
them...AND the gators... I don’t un-derstand the problem I am,” Watkins posted to his account, @jwat14, on March 25.
If Watkins is on the fence, what’s 
stopping other Fort Myers Gators like Earnest Graham and Jevon Kearse from jumping ship? Uh-oh.
- Brett Comer: He is the engine that 
makes the Eagles go. The sophomore point guard is on fire right now, aver-aging 11 points and 12 assists per game in FGCU’s upset victories against 
Georgetown and San Diego State. Billy 
Donovan compared Comer’s court vision to Missouri point guard Phil Pressey, who tallied 10 assists in the Tigers’ 63-60 win against the Gators on Feb. 19.
Comer has proven careless with the 
basketball, averaging 4.9 turnovers per game in the Eagles’ ten losses this sea-son. But with just five total giveaways in two NCAA Tournament contests, he appears more focused and increasingly careful with a national championship 
in his sight.
- The crowd: FGCU is 15-1 this sea-
son when playing at home in Alico 
Arena, which seats 4,500 fans. Now imagine the Eagles playing in Cowboys Stadium. The 30,000 fans who fill Jerry Jones’ cathedral tonight will undoubt-edly be partial to FGCU. UF is 7-5 on the road this year, including three 
losses in its last four games in front of 
hostile crowds. I know tonight’s game is at a neutral site, but c’mon. Two types of non-Gators fans will actively root for Florida tonight. The first type still has a legitimate chance to win his bracket pool. The other probably takes candy from babies and doesn’t wash his hands after using the restroom.
- UF goes cold: The Gators are one 
of the best defensive teams in the coun-try, but if they can’t slow down the Eagles’ fast-paced attack, then UF will need to score a lot to keep up. While Patric Young is capable of stepping up in the paint, Florida lives and dies from 
the perimeter.
As Greg Luca has written repeat-
edly in this paper, one rough offensive 
stretch could be all it takes to sink UF.
If this one becomes a shootout and 
Kenny Boynton and Erik Murphy struggle to hit their three-pointers, then the Gators will become the latest victim in the Eagles’ improbable tourney run.
- “F--k the Gators!”: FGCU has 
already won two games it was sup-posed to lose. Why is Florida any scar-ier? The Gators are flaky at the end of close games. That’s how UF has been eliminated from the past two NCAA Tournaments. Florida is 0-6 in games decided by single digits this season. If the Eagles keep it close tonight, who 
knows?

“We’re really not too concerned with that,” Wilbekin 
said. “The media always finds somebody to really get 
behind, but we can’t really worry about that.”
Historically, Florida has done well in the Big Dance 
against Cinderellas. 
No. 3 seed UF beat No. 11 seed George Mason in the 
2006 Final Four. The Gators defeated the Patriots 73-58 en route to their first national title. 
In last year’s round of 32, seventh-seeded Florida 
handled No. 15 seed Norfolk State for an 84-50 victory. 
Point guard Brett Comer and the fast-tempo Eagles 
thrive in transition. Comer has fueled FGCU, racking up 24 assists.
“[Comer’s] a great passer, but to prevent it, you’ve 
got to stand in front of your man,” guard Kenny Boyn-ton said. “They make a lot of cuts. You can’t let a person get back-door on you.”
FGCU’s Sherwood Brown and Bernard Thompson 
have tallied a combined 43.5 points and 14 boards per game in the tournament. 
If Florida wins Fri-
day night, it would face either No. 1 seed Kansas or No. 4 seed Michigan on Sun-
day. For a Gators team coming off back-to-back Elite Eight exits, this weekend in Arlington could serve as redemption as Florida hopes to end its six-year Final Four drought.
“Obviously it’s in the past and it’s happened, so 
you don’t want to dwell on it too much,” Murphy said.  “Whenever you think about it, it gives you a little 
extra motivation.”hoops , from page 13

UF Men’s Bask etballFRIDAY, MARCH 29, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15
NCAA TOURNAMENT
No. 3 Florida Gators (28-7)
Coach: 
 Andy Enﬁ  eld, second season
 Starting Five: 
  G Brett Comer (8.1 ppg, 6.6 apg): With 
top-notch court vision and a fearless nature, 
Comer is the perfect man to run FGCU’s free-ﬂ  owing, high-ﬂ  ying offense. When he’s not turning the ball over, the Eagles’ offense 
is hard to top. 
   G Bernard Thompson (14.5 ppg, 2.8 
spg): Perhaps the Eagles’ most versatile 
scorer, Thompson can ﬁ  ll it up as ei-ther a shooter or a driver. 
   G Sherwood Brown (15.6 
ppg, 6.6 rpg): Brown can ﬁ  ll a variety of roles for FGCU. As the team’s leading scorer 
and rebounder, he can either 
dominate the ball on the pe-rimeter or bang in the post. Enﬁ  eld has ap-plauded Brown’s relentless effort. 
   F Chase Fieler (12.1 ppg, 5.4 rpg): While 
Fieler’s explosive dunks provided some of the best highlights of the tournament’s opening weekend, his ability to stretch the ﬂ  oor as a three-point shooter should not be 
overlooked. 
  C Eric McKnight (6.6 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 1.3 
bpg): The lanky McKnight is a highlight 
waiting to happen. Whether it’s with an explosive dunk or an emphatic block, McK-night makes a major impact in his 20.6 min-utes per game.   Key Reserve:
 G Christophe Varidel (6.1 ppg, 35.1 
3P%): Varidel is an able and willing three-point shooter who gives the Eagles an offen-sive spark off the bench. 
 
   How they got here: 
Rarely does any underdog win as thor-
oughly as the Eagles did. FGCU secured 10-point wins against both No. 2 seed 
Georgetown and No. 7 seed San 
Diego State by knocking down 
shots and keeping opponents 
off-balance with their ever-changing defense.  
  Strengths:  The Eagles 
have speed and athleticism 
uncommon in a mid-major. In an 
age when the pace of games is consistently 
slowing as coaches attempt to microman-
age every possession, Enﬁ  eld lets his play-
ers play a free-ﬂ  owing offensive style. De-fensively, FGCU’s ability to switch between different zone, man and pressure looks has made life difﬁ  cult for opposing offenses. 
 Weaknesses: 
FGCU’s biggest weaknesses are turn-
overs and defensive rebounding. Although the offense produces a ton of highlights at its best, it can be a turnover-prone disaster when things aren’t clicking. In 10 losses, 
the Eagles have averaged 18 turnovers per 
game, including 4.9 per game from Comer. No. 15 Florida Gulf Coast 
Eagles (26-10)
 Coach: 
 Bill Self, 10th season
  Starting Five: 
 G Elijah Johnson (9.8 ppg, 4.7 apg): 
Johnson has been a major factor in Kansas’ 
occasional offensive struggles. Although he showed signs of improvement late in the regular season, he still has a propensity for 
turnovers and poor shot selection.
  G Ben McLemore (15.8 ppg, 41.6 3P%): 
McLemore, one of the nation’s most tal-
ented players, has shown the ability to score almost at will from anywhere on the court. His reluctance to take on a big-ger role in the offense has kept Kansas from becoming elite on 
that end of the ﬂ  oor. 
 G Travis Releford (11.8 ppg, 
41.5 3P%): Releford is the Jay-
hawks’ top perimeter defender. Al-though not a major threat with the ball in his hands, he has been highly effective as a spot-up shooter. 
 F Kevin Young (7.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg): Op-
posing defenses hardly even guard Young, 
but he is still valuable as defender and re-
bounder. Any offense the Jayhawks get from him is a bonus. 
  C Jeff Withey (13.8 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 3.9 
bpg): One of the nation’s premier shot-blockers, Withey is the anchor of Kansas’ dominant defense. His offensive post game is a work in progress, but he’s an explosive dunker with an above-average jumper.   Key Reserve:  
 G Naadir Tharpe (5.6 ppg, 2.9 apg): The 
other option at Kansas’ weakest position, Tharpe has dealt with many of the same struggles as Johnson. Despite a 34.8 shoot-ing percentage, Tharpe sometimes plays 
like a shoot-ﬁ  rst point guard. 
  How they got here: 
Kansas came close to becoming the ﬁ  rst 1 
seed to ever lose to a 16, narrowly escaping 
with a 64-57 win against Western Kentucky. 
KU’s offensive struggles continued 
against North Carolina. Eventually 
the offense started to ﬂ  ow, and 
Kansas scored 49 points in the 
second half en route to a 70-58 victory. 
  Strengths:  
Kansas thrives thanks to its 
defense, which ranks ﬁ  rst in the 
nation in effective ﬁ  eld goal percentage al-lowed. With Withey patrolling the back 
line, the Jayhawks are third in the nation in 
blocks and have allowed opponents to shoot just 38.7 percent on two-point shots.  
 Weaknesses: 
The Jayhawks have been prone to long 
scoring droughts, thanks mostly to erratic point guard play from Johnson and Tharpe. KU doesn’t have a frontcourt player who can consistently score with his back to the basket, and Releford doesn’t do much off 
the dribble. Only if McLemore takes on a 
larger role can the Jayhawks offense be truly dynamic. No. 1 Kansas Jayhawks (31-5)
Coach: 
 John Beilein, sixth season
 Starting Five: 
  G Trey Burke (18.8 ppg, 6.7 apg): The 
Big Ten Player of the Year, Burke leads the 
nation’s second-most efﬁ  cient offense. Burke does it all, driving the lane at will, shooting 38.7 percent from three and posting a 3.1-to-
1 assist-to-turnover ratio. 
  G Tim Hardaway Jr. (14.9 ppg, 4.6 rpg): 
Hardaway has become a much more efﬁ  -
cient scorer this season, boost-ing his three-point shooting accuracy from 28.3 percent to 39.3 percent. He and Burke make up possibly the nation’s best guard duo. 
   G Nik Stauskas (11.3 ppg, 
43.4 3P%): Although Stauskas has cooled off from the blister-ing pace he shot to start the season, he has still been a valuable weapon from the out-side. 
   F Glenn Robinson (11.1 ppg, 5.5 rpg): 
Robinson has provided a dose of athleticism to Michigan’s frontcourt this season. He’s 
been an efﬁ  cient contributor on offense, 
shooting 57.4 percent. 
  F Mitch McGary (6.8 ppg, 5.9 rpg): Mc-
Gary has come into his own recently, av-eraging 13.3 points and 10.3 rebounds per game since the end of the regular season. A great rebounder and defender, the fresh-man is an underrated athlete.    Key Reserve:
 F Jordan Morgan (5 ppg, 4.5 rpg): 
A starter for most of the season, Morgan 
has slid into a reserve role as McGary has 
emerged. 
 
   How they got here: 
After Michigan rode an unstoppable of-
fense to a ﬁ  rst-round win over No. 13 seed 
South Dakota State, the defense was the big-
gest factor in a 78-53 disman-tling of No. 5 seed VCU. 
  Strengths:  Michigan’s of-
fense can score with anyone, as Burke and Hardaway are two 
of the most talented perimeter 
players in the college game. The 
Wolverines are sometimes overly reliant on jump shots, but that’s hardly a problem at 
the rate they knock them down. 
 Weaknesses: 
For as strong as the Wolverines’ offense 
has been, the lack of a true low-post scorer 
may prove detrimental against an elite de-
fense. Michigan’s defense as a whole has 
been mostly mediocre, ranking below the NCAA average in steals and blocks.  No. 4 Michigan Wolverines

 Coach: 
 Billy Donovan, 17th season
  Starting Five: 
   G Scottie Wilbekin (9.2 ppg, 5 apg): 
In addition to being a lockdown defend-
er, Wilbekin has developed into a scor-ing threat off the dribble, making Flori-
da’s offense all the more dangerous. 
   G Kenny Boynton (12.1 ppg, 2.9 apg): 
Although Boynton is an inconsistent 
shooter, he has been a dynamic scoring threat throughout his career. He ranks second on UF’s all-time scoring list with 2,013 career points.
   G Mike Rosario (12.5 
ppg): Rosario’s effort, intensi-ty and focus have been inconsistent throughout his career, but he can score in a variety of ways when he is at his best. 
   F Erik Murphy (12.8 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 
46.2 3P%): Murphy changes Florida’s of-
fense with his ability to stretch the ﬂ  oor 
from the power forward position. He ranks ﬁ  fth nationally with a 66 effective ﬁ  eld goal percentage. 
   C Patric Young (10.3 ppg, 6.3 rpg, 1.6 
bpg): Young gives the Gators a strong, chiseled interior presence on both of-fense and defense. When he’s running the ﬂ  oor and playing with energy, he’s a near lock for a double-double.   Key Reserve:  
 F Will Yeguete (5.3 ppg, 5.9 rpg): 
After missing six games with a knee 
injury, Florida’s best defender and re-
bounder is rounding back into form at the right time. 
  How they got here: 
Florida dominated the glass and kept 
turnovers to a minimum to easily dis-
patch No. 14 seed Northwestern State 
in the ﬁ  rst round. Then, UF survived an 
early second-half run from 
No. 11 seed Minnesota be-
fore cruising to a 78-64 vic-
tory. 
  Strengths:  
Florida has been one of the na-
tion’s most efﬁ  cient teams on both ends of the ﬂ  oor. With an extremely balanced offense and excellent chemistry on de-fense, the Gators are nearly impossible to beat when they’re playing their best.  
 Weaknesses: 
UF’s offense is heavily reliant on 
three-point shots, taking 40.5 percent of its attempts from beyond the arc. The Gators also struggle to get to the free-throw line, and they shoot just 68 percent when they do get fouled. With streaky three-point shooters and an inability to get cheap points at the line, UF’s offense can be prone to droughts.

Jay Carmichael is no stranger to facing elite Southeastern 
Conference hitting. The freshman right-hander toes the rub-
ber against No. 11 Ole Miss (22-4, 3-3 SEC) on Friday night 
at 7 a week after shutting down No. 5 Vanderbilt on the 
road. Carmichael entered the season as an unknown bull-pen commodity. He has since emerged as the Friday night starter, leapfrogging heralded ace Jonathon Crawford.
“He just competes — bottom line. He goes up there and 
gives it all he has every single pitch,” catcher Taylor Gushue said. “You really can’t ask for more than what he has given us so far. It’s been fantastic, actually.”
Carmichael supplanted Crawford when he started 
against Kentucky on March 15. He hasn’t looked back. The freshman held Kentucky and Vanderbilt to three hits apiece in 10.2 innings as Florida (11-15, 2-4 SEC) won its first two series openers this season with Carmichael on the hill. 
“He’s throwing really good the last time out. Obviously 
each week becomes a new challenge for him,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “He learns something new every time out. Hopefully he will have another good performance here [Fri-
day] night.”
Carmichael outdueled Wildcats left-hander A.J. Reed and Commodores right-hander Kevin Ziomek. Rebels ace Bobby Wahl (6-0, 1.67) starts tonight. Wahl’s six victories 
are tied for the SEC lead. He tossed eight shutout innings against Florida last season in Oxford, Miss. 
Carmichael displayed poise in Nashville, Tenn., after 
falling on the mound while pitching to the leadoff batter in 
the fifth inning. He struck out the next two hitters to put the 
finishing touches on a scoreless inning.
O’Sullivan didn’t know what to expect from the freshman 
right-hander when he arrived at Florida, but Carmichael 
has shown he can handle the increased role. O’Sullivan had 
to limit Carmichael from spending too much time watching film before his first Friday start. 
O’Sullivan wanted Carmichael to continue what he had 
been doing in the bullpen and not think too much on the 
mound. Florida will need its freshman to continue what 
he’s done the last two weekends to pull off another series-opening win.
“He just goes out there and competes his butt off,” Craw-
ford said. “He’s not scared.”
Gators fight injuries: Left-hander Corey Stump (0-2, 2.45) 
underwent surgery on his throwing shoulder on Wednes-day and will miss the remainder of the season. O’Sullivan 
noticed something wrong with the sophomore during his 
last outing when he faced five batters in an 11-5 loss to Ken-tucky on March 16. 
While Stump will not return, shortstop Richie Martin 
will come back soon. O’Sullivan just doesn’t know when. Martin suffered a fractured right index finger in Florida’s 6-3 win against Miami on March 3. His expected recovery time of four weeks would have had him back in time to face the Rebels this weekend. But the freshman who has reached 
base in all 12 games he has played this season is still side-
lined.
“I don’t know. I thought he was going to be ready to 
go this weekend, but it’s not quite healed yet,” O’Sullivan 
said. “We’ll re-evaluate it [Friday] morning and kind of see 
where we are.”
Starting rotation: Crawford (0-4, 5.67) throws in Game 2 
for Florida on Saturday. Ole Miss trots out right-hander 
Mike Mayers (2-2, 2.83) against Crawford and Chris Ellis 
(1-1, 9.00) in the series finale. Both games are set for 1 p.m. Florida hasn’t announced a starter for Sunday.
