The Supreme Court entered into its second 
day of deliberation on gay marriage Wednesday, 
this time to talk about the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act.
The federal law, which passed in 1996, deﬁ  nes 
marriage as between one woman and one man.
Although the court didn’t make a decision 
Wednesday, ﬁ  ve out of the nine justices were critical of the law’s legality.
News of the court’s concern has local gay 
rights activists excited.
Bridget Siegel, a 21-year-old UF religion ju-
nior and president of the UF’s Chapter of Pride Student Union, called gay marriage a basic hu-man right.
“I’m absurdly happy that we’re at least in the 
position where there’s a possibility of equality for everyone,” she said. “That in itself is one of the most amazing things that I could hope to see in my lifetime.”
If the court strikes DOMA down, the govern-ment will extend the same beneﬁ  ts allowed to straight couples, such as health care and tax cuts, to gay couples in states that already recognize gay marriage.
“If you live together, if you have a life togeth-
er, you can ﬁ  le jointly for things,” Siegel said. “It’s the same idea as being married without hav-ing the ceremony.”
The decision would also affect the District of 
Columbia and the nine states that already allow gay marriage such as New York, Iowa and Ver-mont.
On Tuesday, the court also deliberated on 
California’s Proposition 8, a 2008 law that bans gay marriage. After two days of deliberation, the court won’t release a decision until this summer. Court ends second day of

Spam messages in Sakai, UF’s 
course management system, have 
never been an issue until recently.
After the UF Computing Help 
Desk received a number of complaints from students about spam messages in their Sakai inboxes a few weeks ago, UF Information Technology be-gan investigating.
Doug Johnson, the assistant direc-
tor for UF’s learning services, said this is considered a social hacking, not a technical hacking, because no com-puter hacking was found during the investigation. A student used the Ga-torLink usernames and passwords of 19 other individuals to send the mes-sages.
Johnson said UF’s Division of Stu-
dent Affairs and the UF Police Depart-ment are investigating whether the 19 IDs were given voluntarily.
The individual sent about 38,000 
emails to students and instructors in 126 courses, he said.
Johnson, who couldn’t reveal the 
identity of those involved, said the email was promoting a website and service created by the main student.
Rebecca Mysels received the email 
multiple times.
“I deleted it the ﬁ  rst time I saw it,” 
the 23-year-old, ﬁ  rst-year UF early childhood education graduate stu-dent said. “But when I logged in a few hours later, it was there again.”
UFIT has turned the report over to 
Student Affairs and UPD to determine what action to take next, Johnson said. Because this incident violated multiple UF policies as well as state and federal laws related to spam, the individual could face ﬁ  nes and expulsion.UF investigates Sakai spamCAMPUS
◗ STUDENT BODY PRESIDENT TJ 
VILLAMIL RECEIVED AN APOLOGY EMAIL.
COLLEEN WRIGHT
Alligator Writer
Florida Gulf Coast University’s Stu-
dent Body issued an apology to UF after 
students at an FGCU pep rally shouted vulgar chants broadcasted on live TV.
FGCU Student Body President Peter 
Cuderman apologized in an email to UF Student Body President Tj Villamil after students chanted “F--- the Gators” dur-ing an ESPN broadcast.
The FGCU Eagles will play the Gators 
in the South Region semiﬁ  nal of the NCAA  basketball tournament Friday. The Eagles are the ﬁ  rst No. 15 seed to ad-vance to the Sweet 16 in the tournament’s history, according to ESPN.
Cuderman wrote the negative chants 
do not reﬂ  ect on the university.
“Often times, excitement and a new 
experience can cause rash and hasty de-cisions to be made,” he wrote in the apol-ogy email. “In this moment of excitement for our young school, I hope that you will accept our expression of regret.”
Villamil said he understood the stu-
dents got caught in the heat of the mo-ment. 
He said he was surprised by the apol-
ogy.
“It was one of those things that showed 
the character of their student representa-tives on campus,” he said.
FGCU Student Body President-elect 
Juan Cubillo said he read Cuderman’s apology.
“People just decided to show their 
competitive nature the wrong way,” he said. “I’m sure most of them would change the chant that they did to not get negative publicity.”

Verna Groger believes cooking more 
meals at home can reduce her salt intake. 
And that, according to a new study, can only be good for her health.
Results from the 2010 Global Burden of 
Disease Study were presented last week and  stated over-consumption of salt contributed to 2.3 million deaths from cardiovascular dis-eases worldwide. In the United States, there were 429 deaths for every million adults.
Groger, a registered dietician at the 
Gainesville Haven Hospice, said the abun-dance of processed food people eat causes them to take in more than 4,000 milligrams of sodium each day. The World Health Or-ganization’s recommended daily sodium intake is 2,000 milligrams.
“People are so used to the processed foods 
that are high in sodium, sugar and fat that our taste buds are acculturated,” she said.
The American Heart Association advises 
moderate consumption of the “Salty Six”: common foods high in sodium, including sandwiches, soups, cold cuts and cured meats, bread and rolls, pizza and poultry.
Leonore Antoni, owner of Corner Latin 
Confusion restaurant, said many Hispanic dishes, as well as other exotic foods, use spices for flavor instead of salt.
“A lot of American foods rely on salt be-
cause they don’t use as many spices as we do,” Antoni said. “Without the salt, it would be very bland.”Salty food kills, study shows

The Rock ‘n’ Roll Camp for Girls, 
founded in Portland, Ore., is expanding to 
Gainesville.
Chelsea Carnes, a 24-year-old UF histo-
ry senior and music teacher at Studio Per-cussion, started the camp in Gainesville.
“After volunteering at the girls camps 
in Jacksonville and Orlando, I felt very in-spired by the feeling of empowerment being given to girls. And having the instruments needed at Studio Percussion, I decided to start one here with some friends,” said Car-nes, the camp’s co-director.
The theme is empowerment for girls.“It’s especially interesting that they are 
trying to pursue this sense of empower-ment for girls through rock ‘n’ roll, which is typically seen as masculine,” said Kathy Keeter, a 21-year-old UF Spanish, political science and women’s studies senior and vice president of external affairs of UF’s Women’s Student Association.
The camp will run from Aug. 5 to Aug. 
10 at Studio Percussion, 2512 NE First Blvd., Building 500, and is open to girls be-tween the ages of 8 and 17. On the first day, they will choose an instrument. During the camp, attendees will spend half the day learning the instrument, while they spend the other half in arts and crafts and wom-en’s history workshops. When the camp ends, the girls will put together a perfor-mance at the music venue 1982.
“I think any kind of program that em-
powers girls is a good one,” Keeter said.Camp Rock — in GainesvilleLOCAL

UF senior◗ THE STUDY FOUND REGULAR 
USE OF ASPIRIN MAY REDUCE RISK.
SOFIA RATTES
Alligator Contributing Writer
An aspirin a day might keep skin 
cancer away.
A new study comprised of about 
60,000 postmenopausal women discov-
ered that people who used aspirin on a regular basis were 21 percent less likely to be diagnosed with the deadliest form of skin cancer: melanoma.
“Aspirin is kind of a wondrous drug 
because people are continually find-ing new uses for it,” said Paul Doering, pharmacy professor at the UF College of Pharmacy, “anywhere from protec-tion against heart attacks, to protection against colon cancer. The list is a mile long of things that aspirin is allegedly good for.” 
Aspirin use for five years or more 
was linked to a 30 percent reduction in melanoma risk, according to a study published in the journal “Cancer.” 
However, Doering said there is a ter-
rible temptation to associate what they found with a direct cause-and-effect re-lationship. He said this type of research is observational, where they don’t ac-tually administer drugs to people and watch them for a period of time to see what goes on with them.
Saajan Patel, a 21-year-old UF Col-
lege of Pharmacy graduate student, said participants need to be in a controlled environment. They can’t sunbathe and take aspirin, assuming it will prevent skin cancer, he said.
The study did not conclude aspirin is 
the cause of the decrease in cancer risk. It simply found regular use was associat-ed with a drop in risk among Caucasian women who were studied. The study re-lied on self-reports of aspirin use.
“We have to be very careful to inter-
pret, ‘what does this really mean?’” Do-ering said. “I think it’s way premature to suggest that all women out there ought to gobble down an aspirin every day to prevent skin cancer.”4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MARCH 28, 2013

Florida’s consumer confidence 
and optimism about the recession 
rose in the month of March.
Chris McCarty, director of UF’s 
Survey Research Center and direc-tor of the Bureau of Economic and Business Research, said the jump was unexpected.
He said this increased opti-
mism indicates, in terms of the economy, Floridians feel they are better off.
But Florida doesn’t match the 
national statistics.
McCarty said as a whole, confi-
dence is down nationwide.
The survey was from March 13 to March 21 and polled 416 indi-viduals.
Consumer confidence rose 
from 73 points to 76 points, and personal finances now compared to a year ago increased four points to 68, according to the survey.
However, expectations of per-
sonal finances a year from now fell two points to 72.
McCarty said the fact that 
Florida’s unemployment rate, at 7.8, is 0.1 percent lower than the U.S. could have 
contributed to the rise.
“It is the first 
time in quite some time that Florida has been under the U.S.,” he said.
But McCarty 
said this is a temporary turning point for Florida.
“There will be effects that Flo-ridians can feel,” he said. “It will just take a little time.”
However, not everyone is as 
optimistic.
Camille Jamshidi, an 18-year-
old UF health science freshman, said she was unsure about the health of the economy.
“It’s looking like it could go 
up,” she said. “But I’m not certain if it could get better.”

While he was up in Prague 
during the Holocaust, Petr Ginz 
dreamed about space and docu-mented the horrors around him in his diary.
However, in 1944, he died 
alone at Auschwitz, leaving behind five novels, a diary, an underground magazine and more than 100 drawings and paintings.
He was 16 years old, but 
some people believe he could have been the next Leonardo DaVinci.
To commemorate Ginz’s 
life, the Bob Graham Center for Public Service will screen the documentary “The Last Flight of Petr Ginz” at 7 tonight at the Phillips Center for the Perform-ing Arts.  
UF partnered with Wake 
Forest University to produce the film, said Churchill Roberts, co-director of the documentary. It will feature animations of Ginz’s work.
“It’s a different Holocaust 
story,” he said. “It’s aimed as much at a young audience as it is an older audience.”
The screening is also spon-
sored by UF Performing Arts, UF’s Center for Jewish Studies, the College of Journalism and Communications, UF’s Jewish Student Union, UF Hillel and Accent Speaker’s Bureau.
Tickets are free and will be 
available at noon at the Phillips Center Box Office with a limit of four tickets a person.
A panel 
discussion will follow the movie. 
The panel will include R o b e r t s , Kenneth D. Wald, a UF political sci-
ence professor, and Ginz’s for-mer bunkmate, Sydney Taus-sig, Churchill said. 
David Colburn, interim di-
rector of the Graham Center,  wants students who see the film to think about the importance of democracy and freedom.

When it comes to Coca-Cola Co., 
UF students will now have a health-
ier option when choosing what to drink.
“Fruitwater,” a “naturally fla-
vored, zero calorie sparkling water beverage,” will be available April 1, said Coca-Cola Co. spokeswoman Lindsey Raivich.
The drink will be sweetened 
with sucralose, commonly known as Splenda, and will contain no juice.
The new drink will be “enhanced with nutrients + other natural fla-vors,” according the bottle’s label. These nutrients will include B vita-mins, magnesium and zinc, accord-ing to The Associated Press.
Soonkyu Chung, a UF food sci-
ence and human nutrition assistant professor, said she doesn’t think it’s proper for the company to promote nutrients in its drink when it doesn’t contain actual fruit.
“People usually don’t drink for 
their nutrition,” she said.
George Baker, a UF food science 
and human nutrition assistant sci-entist, said people might prefer the drink to fruit juice because it is “all about the calories.”
He added that Splenda, an artifi-
cial sweetener, is safe to consume.
“Moderation is the key with ev-
erything, and if that’s the case, then we do alright for ourselves,” he said.
However, the contents of the 
drink concern some UF students.
Chrissa Harmon, a 21-year-old 
UF food science and human nutri-tion junior, doesn’t plan to buy the new drink. “When I want fruit fla-vor, I just always eat a fruit. I don’t ever crave fake flavors,” she said.Coke releases new ‘Fruitwater’ drink
Students have mixed reactions to debate
In the meantime, legislators in Illinois, Minnesota, Rhode Island and Delaware could vote on same-sex measures beforehand, according to published reports.
Siegel said she is pleasantly surprised by how aggres-
sively the marriage equality movement has spread.
“If you’d asked me a year ago, I would’ve told you 
that it would never happen in my lifetime,” she said. “This is vibrant, this is real. This could happen by the time I’m ready to get married.”
But not everyone feels the same way as Siegel.Students like Amore Kotze, a 21-year-old UF me-
chanical engineering junior, believes that this law has caused a lot of unnecessary hatred.
“People are being told, ‘If you don’t agree with this 
and you don’t pass this, then you are closed-minded, and you are a bigot.’ I don’t think that’s fair,” she said. “Just because I believe the law shouldn’t pass doesn’t mean that I’m closed-minded or that I don’t love those people, because that’s not true.”MARRiAGE , from page 1McCarty

◗ UF HAS SEEN INCREASES IN 
STUDENT RECRUITMENT.
ROBERTA FIORITO
Alligator Contributing Writer
The mantra of college students during 
the last four decades has been to gradu-
ate and find a job — until the recent re-cession. Since then, about half of em-ployed graduates are in jobs that don’t normally require a degree, according to a recent study by the Center for College Affordability and Productivity.
After the recession, economists gen-
erally believed the problem would im-prove. However, a report released Mon-day by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that U.S. college gradu-ates may continue to hold jobs that don’t require their level of education, even af-ter the economy recovers.
Colin Knapp, a visiting economics 
professor in UF’s Warrington College of Business Administration, said these find-ings don’t signal a doomsday for college students. Instead, he believes students should be prepared to adapt to today’s job market.
“I don’t see this as a death sentence 
for college graduates,” Knapp said.
He said it would probably take time 
for higher education to align with the la-bor market and for schools to catch up with teaching the right skill sets.
Heather White, director of UF’s Ca-
reer Resource Center, has worked with the center for about nine years. She said UF has seen increases in student recruit-ment and involvement by companies in recent years.
“We are on that cusp of seeing new 
industries and new positions for stu-dents,” she said.
White said it’s important for students 
to diversify their skills because many jobs graduates seek may not exist yet.
“Major doesn’t equal career,” she 
said. “There’s a lot out there, and [stu-dents] shouldn’t give up hope. There’s so many students getting jobs, and it’s important to tell that side of the story as well.”Life after college — jobless?

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that 
a search by a Miami-Dade police officer and his 
drug-sniffing dog outside a Miami man’s house without a warrant was unconstitutional.
In 2006, police arrested Joelis Jardines on 
marijuana trafficking charges after a police dog detected he was growing marijuana at his house.
But officials from Gainesville Police and the 
Alachua County Sheriff’s Office said their po-lice dogs don’t conduct searches in that man-
ner.
GPD Spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said 
officers don’t conduct “open-air sniffs” at a 
suspect’s home. Instead, he said, the Gaines-ville-Alachua County Drug Task Force, an ASO-GPD drug unit, uses other methods, such as surveillance and undercover purchases, to investigate drug-related crimes.
“If we were in that same situation, we 
would’ve done a much more in-depth investi-gation rather than just walking a dog by their door,” he said.
ASO Spokesman Art Forgey said he agrees 
with the Supreme Court’s ruling.
“If they don’t have justification to be on pri-vate property, whether it’s a dog or a person,” Forgey said, “you’re not going to have a case there.”
For law enforcement agencies around Flor-
ida, the result of the ruling is yet to be deter-mined.
“Everyone is going to be reviewing exactly 
what the ruling is to see exactly how it impacts protocols that are used in canine handlers ob-taining evidence that could be used in a crimi-nal case,” said Spencer Mann, State Attorney’s Office spokesman.
The officer secured a search warrant and 
found 179 marijuana plants Jardines’ home, according to the Associated Press. Jardines challenged his arrest, saying police violated his Fourth Amendment rights, according to court records. The case went to the Florida and U.S. Supreme Courts, which both sided with Jar-dines. As a result, the evidence against him was thrown out.

104 TOTAL VOTESComparisons to models do not exist at all 
How do we know if bananas are priced well?
We look around the farmers market, Publix, Wal-
Mart, Winn-Dixie, etc.
How do we know if we did well on an exam?
We compare our grades to the class average and our 
friends’ grades in the same class. How do we compare peo-ple as a whole? If we were to put a numerical value on how much people are worth, that would objectify them.
But we do that. The media and our own observations of 
what traits in people are valued and desired have inﬂ  uenced us to be constantly insecure and to ﬁ  t a mold created as a result of society’s narrow expectations.
For us to appreciate someone, we must compare. Com-
parison is inevitable. And it is also harmful for your self-worth. Movies and TV shows often cast tall, white, blonde and very sexual women. Men are hunky, broad-shouldered and brown-haired. Pop culture books often have a female protagonist who is completely normal, naive and naturally gorgeous. She is pretty, poised and perfect.
The media has inﬁ  ltrated society, and the way we try to 
look and act like is based on what we see. Women are more likely to be affected by advertising. Fifty percent of commer-cials aimed at girls speak about physical attractiveness, al-though none of the commercials aimed at boys refer to physi-cal appearance. Seemingly, the most important trait a woman can have is her looks, even if these looks are unhealthy.
The average woman in the U.S. is 5 feet 4 inches tall and 
weighs 140 pounds. The average U.S. model is 5 feet 11 inch-es tall and only 117 pounds, according to The Eating Disor-der Foundation. Most runway models meet the Body Mass Index physical criteria for anorexia. 
As a result of advertising and heavy preferences from the 
media, and in turn, society, four out of ﬁ  ve women are un-satisﬁ  ed with their appearances. Ninety percent of women overestimate their body size. Victoria’s Secret models are classic examples. There are few women in the world who we all admire and love as much as them.
Women want to be like them. Men want to be with them.Their existence is hard to deny, and we call them Angels. 
Everyone has their favorite — the Aussie with the dimples or the dark-haired Brazilian babe?
Angels are not Homo sapiens. 
They are a group that’s members look very exotic, tall, thin, toned and perfectly curvy. Such perfec-tion in one package is too good to be true.
After discussions about Victo-
ria’s Secret in advertising classes and some Googling of my own 
(like: “Candice Swanepoel in real life” and “Adriana Lima without makeup”), I’ve reached the conclusion Victoria’s Se-cret models are pampered, edited and gloriﬁ  ed by the adver-tising department of America’s largest lingerie retailer.
No matter how many times we tell men and women these 
women are unreal, they do not believe us. These models are paid to look good for a living. They work out for hours with their personal trainers each day. They follow strict diets and eat meals prepared by their nutritionists. Their butts, breasts and faces are pounded with layers of makeup. Their bodies are slathered with lotion before a photoshoot, and their bras are push-ups, padded and stuffed with silicon inserts.
Under direction from a handful of people, and with per-
fect lighting, they pose in the proper angle to emphasize their perfect bodies. Their images are then edited and airbrushed to have thinner thighs, smaller waists and more cleavage.
Miranda Kerr is an A-cup, however, with “plastic sur-
gery” via Photoshop, she looks like a plump C-cup, accord-ing to www.skinnyvscurvy.com. Selita Ebanks, another Victoria’s Secret Angel, told the New York Daily News, “It’s all about creating the illusion of this amazing body on the runway. People don’t realize that there are about 20 layers of makeup on my butt alone.”
Everyone, more or less, knows models are unreal, and we 
have unrealistic expectations of ourselves. Yet we continue to aim to be as fake as they are. The media has created an image that, in actuality, doesn’t exist at all. Even the models do not look like their pictures.

Woman: 
Obama’s Secret Service 
pick is a smart one
This week, President Barack Obama named the next di-rector of the U.S. Secret Service. For the ﬁ  rst time in the agency’s history, a woman was picked. Let’s give a round 
of applause to Julia Pierson, ladies and gents.
Here are our top three reasons why putting a woman in 
charge of the Secret Service is a great idea:
ONE: NO MORE PROSTITUTION SCANDALSRemember last year, when several Secret Service agents on 
assignment in Colombia brought prostitutes back to their hotel rooms? 
“During the Colombia prostitution scandal, the Secret Service 
lost the trust of many Americans, and failed to live up to the high expectations placed on it.” said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, in an article by the Detroit Free Press. “Ms. Pierson has a lot of work ahead of her to create a culture that respects the important job the agency is tasked with. I hope she succeeds in restoring lost credibility in the Secret Service.” We’re pretty sure she can get everyone back on track, even though I guess hiring hookers in foreign countries is like America’s third favorite pastime.
TWO: WOMEN ARE THE BEST AT SECRETSWe’re great at keeping them, and we’re great at leaking them. 
If Pierson is just like every other woman ever, she’ll be great at giving up classiﬁ  ed information. Typical ladies. Just kidding. 
“Ms. Pierson got the job because of her 30 years of experience 
and because the leadership skills she’s shown throughout her career at the United States Secret Service,” White House spokes-man Josh Earnest said, in a report by USA Today. “The fact that she is the ﬁ  rst woman to lead this agency is notable ... but it’s not the reason she was chosen for the job.”
THREE: SHE GRADUATED FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF 
CENTRAL FLORIDA, AND THAT’S PRETTY COOL
Like, no offense or anything, but it’s rare you hear a promi-
nent person in the news who also happened to graduate from UCF. A report from The Daily Beast reads:
“Pierson’s ﬁ  rst job after graduating from the University of 
Central Florida was with the Orlando Police Department, where she was an ofﬁ  cer. From there she went to the Miami ﬁ  eld ofﬁ  ce of the Secret Service, turning in exemplary work and receiving a series of promotions that eventually took her to Washington. ‘She’s hit every position on the way up to chief of staff,’ Paul Morrissey, assistant director of the Ofﬁ  ce of Government and Public Affairs, said when she was named chief of staff. He said it was ‘absolutely amazing.’ Her rise is especially remarkable con-sidering the macho culture that she was operating in and had to navigate.” There you have it, everyone.
We think we can all feel plenty secure in Obama’s selection. 
Pierson appears to be a hard worker. Of course, we write this glowing editorial for her now, and who knows what strange past she might have that won’t come to light until crass journal-ists get ahold of it. Until then, we have full faith in how Pierson 
will run things, and we’re excited to see how she does.

◗ HOODIE ALLEN PER-
FORMS WEDNESDAY.
COURTNEY NACHLAS
Avenue Contributing Writer
Ghetto backgrounds, crimi-
nal records and drug history are 
some things associated with the rappers who dominate iPods across America. That is until a student from the University of Pennsylvania with a dream came along and changed the game.
Steven Markowitz, 24, was 
once an average white, Jewish kid from Long Island until he became America’s sold-out rap star.
Markowitz, known as 
Hoodie Allen, will perform his recent release, “Crew Cuts,” at High Dive Wednesday. Though many students may remem-ber Hoodie’s Gainesville debut last September with Child-ish Gambino on Flavet Field, Hoodie will headline the event this time.
To find out about the man 
underneath the hood, the Av-enue talked to Markowitz about what it takes to make it.
Q: What would you say are 
the differences in performing with Childish Gambino and per-forming with Aer?
A: The main difference, I 
guess, is you know with the Childish show, I was obviously playing for a majority of people who had no idea who I was. I was just an opener on that show, which was awesome ‘cause I got to get in front of so many people. But now, this is my tour and my fans, who know all the words, coming and showing up.
Q: Why make your most re-
cent release, “Crew Cuts,” free?
A: Really, I just wanted to give back to all the fans who sup-ported “All American,” ‘cause that was obviously the first time I ever put anything up for sale, and the response was amazing. So, this is like my way of saying, “Here’s my next album. It’s free; enjoy it.”
Q: What makes this album 
different from “All American”?
A: I think the main difference 
is musicality. We really tried to make the sounds on “Crew Cuts” a little more diverse, a little more complicated. Overall, I feel like it has a little bit more heart and soul to it.
Q: What’s your favorite song 
to perform from “Crew Cuts”?
A: “Two Lips” (Featuring 
OCD Moosh and Twist).Q: What made you confi-
dent enough to leave a secure lifestyle and pursue a music career?
A: I wasn’t 100 percent con-
fident. It was definitely a leap of faith — sort of one of those things where, when you know, like, that you want to do some-thing and something is right, sometimes you have to go for it, even if you don’t have [a] safety net to fall back on.
Q: Who is on your iPod?A: Kanye, Kid Cudi, Drake.
Q: Will you visit Alpha Ep-
silon Pi as an alumnus while 
you’re here?
A: I suppose anything is 
possible. Tell them to go get tickets, and if I feel the love during the show, I’m sure I’ll make an appearance.
Q: All of the sorority girls 
want to know if you’re single. Are you?
A: Um, good question, soror-
ity girls. But yeah, I have to let them down on that one.  
Even though Hoodie is taken, 
all of his tickets aren’t. Tickets to Hoodie Allen with opening act Aer are available at Hear Again Music, High Tides and www.ticketweb.com for $18 in advance and $21 the day of the show.
To the average kids vibing to 
rap tracks in Library West hop-ing to make it big, let Markowitz show you how it’s done. Doors will open at 9 p.m.

Underground art isn’t restricted to 
street art at the Mass Visual Arts’ third 
annual art exhibition.
The nonprofit art organization’s un-
derground-themed showcase will begin at 6 p.m. Friday through April 7 at The Wooly, 20 N. Main St.
Dale Gunnoe, 38, director of Mass Vi-
sual Arts, said the theme is ambiguous to leave open interpretation.
Gunnoe said people can expect differ-
ent types of art, video and sound piece, from artists throughout the country, some 
professional and others amateur.
C o n s t a n c e 
Humphries, 46, of Asheville, N.C., will have a five-minute vid-eo displayed during the exhibition. The piece, 
which she created last year, explores the emotions people hide. Her feelings about her parents’ divorce inspired the video, she said.  
“My work is very personal,” she said. 
“That’s usually where it starts.”
She said her work is abstract and 
doesn’t tell a story.
Margaret Ross Tolbert, of Gainesville, 
takes a different approach with her art. She said she wanted to show a narrative.
Tolbert, who has participated in the 
event before, will display a painting and a video this year.
She hopes the show gives her the op-
portunity to break into new circles.
“I’m just excited to see what a lot of the 
artists come up with,” she said.Underground

Have you ever listened to your favorite 
band’s album and wondered, “That’s it?” 
As a consumer, you’re not the only one, and the music industry is feeling the con-sequences.
The music industry could make about 
$450 million more than its already $2.6 billion in revenue if artists, managers and labels offered additional content to fans, according to a recent Nielsen study.
SXSW surveyed 4,000 consumers for 
the study, which examined the degree to which fans are willing to connect with artists through exclusive merchandise like limited-edition signed posters, bo-nus tracks, T-shirts and handwritten lyric sheets.
“I think that the music industry is con-
stantly changing because society is chang-ing,” said Lindsie Herring, a 20-year-old UF telecommunication junior and former intern at Country 103.7 the Gator.
Fans are willing to pay 
for extras if given the op-portunity, according to the study.
Of the most-active mu-
sic buyers, 53 percent said they would be willing to pay more for a favorite 
band while it’s recording a new album. Less-active buyers were predictably less likely to drop extra dough on music-relat-ed products.
Even the group Nielsen calls Ambiva-
lent Consumers, which are 22 percent of the population and spend an average of $73 a year on music, said they would buy unique material if given the opportunity.
Director of programming for the Col-
lege of Journalism and Communications, Jerry Butler, said technology such as the Internet is the reason for the change in the music industry.
“As a listener, as a consumer, we like to 
think that it’s all about us when in fact it’s still a business,” Butler said.

The time has finally come to 
set those boots aside and hit the 
pool deck. Spring is here, and the tans are near — but can you find those bathing suits under-neath all that mess?
A new season calls for a 
fresh start, and as everyone is well aware, it’s time for some spring cleaning.
Not only should closets, 
kitchens and bathrooms be cleaned, but diets, desks and even phonebooks should make the cut.
1. Clean up your diet  for a 
poolside-ready bod.
Throw out the pizza coupons, 
and think twice about Relish Big Tasty Burgers. Be reminded there are two gyms within bik-ing distance on campus, and they’re free with a Gator 1 Card.2. Car owners: Take the 
junk out of your trunk.
A fresh start into a new season 
involves having a fresh whip. 
Give it a nice wash, vacuum those carpets and hang up that spring-smelling car freshener. 
3. Move on from last semes-
ter’s assignments. 
This is Spring semester, and 
the sum-mer’s so close that we can taste it. But no one wants to enter sum-mer vaca-
tion and have piles of old as-signments to go through. So, organize it now.
The notebooks overflowing 
with last semester’s notes prob-ably have more use in storage than on top of your desk.4. Clean out your phone-
book.
An entire semester has passed 
and another one is halfway 
through, so that’s a good amount of Midtown nights captured in our phones. For all of the random numbers you got on your nights out, it’s time to toss them.
A fresh phonebook is ready 
for spring and summer flings. Delete the past “Hey, I met you last night” texts, and make room for new ones.
5. Mentally prepare yourself 
for what’s coming around the corner: finals.  
Clean out your mind from all 
that end-of-the-semester stress, and focus on the one last battle college students must face before drenching themselves in sum-mer bliss.
Hopefully, you’ll find your 
spring cleaning to be as cleansing as spring itself.

In case you’ve been hiding under 
a rock, “Veronica Mars,” America’s 
all-time favorite teenage private eye, is headed to the big screen.
The sassy blond detective from 
the cult TV show, played by Kris-ten Bell, will soon return to a the-ater near you thanks to creator Rob Thomas and millions of dollars of fans’ donations.
Thomas, along with Bell and 
her co-stars, launched a Kickstarter campaign on March 13 with a goal to raise $2 million in the hopes of bringing the popular show, which was canceled after three seasons, back from the dead.
Within a matter of hours, Thom-
as’ dream became a reality: Warner Bros. gave the project a greenlight.
Now, the Mars troupe has raised 
more than $4 million from more than 61,000 donors with 15 days left in the campaign. The gang just opened its Kickstarter page to fans across the globe in Italy, Australia, the United Kingdom and more.
If the “Veronica Mars” movie 
couldn’t get any cooler, donors can own a part of the film before it’s re-leased. Donors are sent either a T-shirt, a copy of the official script or a downloadable theatrical version of the movie, depending on how much they pledge to the campaign.
I don’t know about you, but I’m 
absolutely pumped for this movie. Veronica Mars was, like, my hero. She’s spunky, smart and super cute. Plus, she was the only character on TV who understood my angsty teenage ways.
You better believe I’m ready for 
this — I’ve already donated, and now I’m (im)patiently awaiting the film’s summer 2014 release. Get ex-cited, marshmallows.‘Veronica Mars’ fans

Dear Friend,
Your man friend said it wasn’t a bad thing, 
so I wouldn’t worry too much about trying to be the sex goddess you’re thinking of. You should still try to make the first move, and see how it feels. Maybe you’ll like being in control more than you think. Regardless, I highly recommend you try your naked-am-bush idea just for fun. But remember: With 
great power comes great responsibility.Dear Mediocre Advice,
I was in bed with my man friend the other night when he mentioned he feels I am sometimes timid in bed. I felt like I haven’t been the sex goddess he wants me to be. He said it wasn’t a bad thing, just an observation. Pouncing on dudes isn’t usually my style. I prefer they make the first move. Should I start naked-
ambushing him at every corner?
Dear Friend,
The more he asks, the more you have to question wheth-er it was actually good. It’s a crappy feeling to constantly tell the truth to someone you care about only to have them doubt you. Despite popular belief, sex does not al-ways need to be amazing. Sometimes, it’s just satisfying, and trying to constantly reach that mind-blowing level can be exhausting. Let him know if he really was bad in bed, you would not still be having sex with him. He shouldn’t beat himself up about it. Right now, he is acting like you’re out of his league, and if this continues, that may 
come true. Tell him to get over it.Dear Mediocre Advice,
The guy I’m with has a phobia of bad sex and has to ask how it was after every time. It’s consistently fantastic — which I tell him — but I’m afraid he might not believe me because he’s always asking. Any sugges-tions for things I can say or do to get him 
to stop doubting himself?
Dear Friend,
Unless he doesn’t have arms, he should be the only person popping his pimples. I stress this even more for 
public settings.Dear Mediocre Advice,
Is it OK to pop my boyfriend’s pimples 
in public?
Dear Friend,
You’re basically asking me to choose between food or water if I were strand-ed on a boat in the middle of the ocean. How am I supposed to live with myself thinking I have to choose one? I need 
both!Dear Mediocre Advice,
Friends or Seinfeld?

Lost in an endlessly growing queue and buried underneath thou-
sands of rows of titles, there are these few hidden gems of Netflix.
“Dhobi Ghat (Mumbai Diaries)” directed by Kiran Rao, 100 
minutes, 2010
In America, the Indian caste system is as synonymous with India 
as anything else. The 2010 film “Dhobi Ghat” looks at the interac-
tion among a group of people separated by socioeconomic status and time.
The film follows the stories of a reclusive artist 
Arun (portrayed by premier Indian film actor Aamir Khan, “Lagaan”); Shai (Monica Dogra) a photogra-pher on sabbatical; and a “dhobi” (a washer, janitor class) named Munna (Prateik).
As these characters begin to somewhat break 
down the barriers between their classes, they begin to see each other and themselves differently. It’s a 
traditional “we’re all the same” story.
The story of Arun watching the sad story of Yasmin (Kriti Malho-
tra), who lived in Arun’s apartment before he did, leaving behind a video journal, was particularly heartbreaking and poetic.
“Dhobi Ghat” is a predominantly Hindi-language film (English 
is spoken by the upper-class in the movie), but it’s not a Bollywood film as it lacks the traditional musical and production scale found in Bollywood films.
Its handheld-film style makes it feel more raw and authentic. 
It’s a good starter movie if you want to watch more Indian films, especially because Bollywood films may be a bit too spritely and animated for American audiences.

Last August, I was working 
in Cologne, Germany, when I ap-
proached the hostess stand of an outdoor drinking area and asked, in my best possible German, “Ist das ein Biergarten?” (Worth noting: I speak terrible German.)
The hostess took a step backward 
and blinked several times, and then frowned. Then she started laughing at me. When she finished, in nearly perfect English she said, “I’m sorry, but what are you trying to ask?”
Last Saturday, I relived this ex-
perience when I went to Midtown’s The Swamp to sample their own take on the German classic, the Beer Garden.
The Swamp’s Beer Garden, “The 
Green Gator,” had its grand open-ing March 14 and featured an array of crafted beers and special sausage dishes to “please our palates” and to “enhance the flavors of their spe-cial brews.”
When I approached the hostess 
stand and asked to be seated in the Beer Garden, she blinked like she was trying to get sand out of her eyes and said, “I’m sorry, but what are you talking about?”
Now, I’m not a business expert, 
but I imagine a good rule of thumb for any establishment is to make sure your employees know when there’s been a grand opening. I would recommend they also know 
A. what’s grand B. what opened.
Thinking the 
Beer Garden had, perhaps, been a one-time event, I asked to be seated to the 
hostess’s whimsy, and my company and I were then brought to an out-door patio.
When I asked our waitress about 
the Beer Garden, I received my sec-ond perplexed look of the evening. She said, “Oh, you’re sitting in it.” When I asked if I could see the menu for their new beer selection, she said, “You know, they didn’t tell me either.”
Which brings me to my third 
business suggestion: C. If you’re running a restaurant, your staff should know the menu.  
When I asked if any of the new menu items were available, she said, “I looked for them earlier, but I couldn’t find them” — a coincidence because neither could I. I asked her for what the bartender would con-sider their best new beer, and I or-dered tuna, not German sausage, which came out with no silverware, so I then had to wait to eat it.
I stared at my beer, and I stared 
at my tuna, and I suddenly missed Germany very much.
As a writer, I would like to tell 
you more about the Beer Garden, but from my experience, no one seems to know about it — not even the people who work there. So, here’s what I can tell you:
1. The new outdoor patio area is 
actually very nice.
2. There is a nice new selection of 
beers to choose from, albeit a little pricy. Quality never killed anyone.
3. I wouldn’t call the Beer Gar-
den a beer garden. I would call it a patio. 
Although it is a very nice patio, 
it is still connected to The Swamp. Until an actual beer garden opens in the greater Gainesville area, I’ll see you at Stubbies & Steins, which is the closest thing we have so far. Prost!

Revenge never tasted so sweet. 
The Gators shocked the 49ers on a last-
second layup to win 67-65 in the Halton Arena on Wednesday night, redeeming a season-ending loss to Charlotte in the WNIT in 2010-11. 
With the victory, Florida advances to the 
Elite Eight of the WNIT for the first time un-der coach Amanda Butler.
“Obviously very, very proud of our 
toughness and our fight and resilience,” Butler said. “We did not play our best ball game, which had everything to do with the way Charlotte played. Got to give them a lot of credit.”
Trailing 65-64 with 20 seconds remain-
ing in the second half, junior guard Jaterra Bonds earned her first two free throws of the contest. After making the first, Bonds missed an opportunity to give the Gators the lead on her second try.
But senior Jennifer George grabbed the 
rebound to give the Gators a chance to avoid overtime — UF’s 81-77 loss to Charlotte two seasons ago came in overtime — with one final possession. 
Bonds took full advantage, working into 
the lane and scoring a layup with 3 seconds remaining. 
“Jaterra lives for those situations; she is a 
champion,” Butler said. 
“When Jennifer made a champion’s play 
and got that offensive rebound and we had the last possession, I knew if Jaterra was go-ing to have anything to do with it, this game was not going to go into overtime.”
Bonds remembered the pain from when 
Florida fell to Charlotte two years ago dur-ing her freshman season. She scored a game-high 23 points in the losing effort. 
Bonds came through again on Wednes-
day night. She led the Gators with 15 points on 7-of-15 shooting while adding four as-sists, three rebounds and two steals.“As soon as I found out that we played 
Charlotte, I immediately thought about our 17-point lead (in the 2010-11 matchup), and they came back and beat us in overtime,” Bonds said. “It was in the back of my mind throughout the whole game. I didn’t want that to happen again.”
Florida led for most of the first half, but 
Charlotte battled back midway through the second. 
George, who averaged just 4.5 points in 
WNIT wins against Florida International and Winthrop, played her best 20 minutes of basketball prior to halftime. 
The senior forward scored 10 of her 14 
points as the Gators took a 34-28 lead into the break. 
George was quiet for much of the second 
half before corralling Bonds’ missed free throw to set up Florida’s final possession. 
“This whole year, we have been through 
a lot,” George said. “That put us in the posi-tion where we are now. We’ve been battle-tested. … We’re not expecting defeat right now.”
Added Butler: “I really liked our ma-turity down the stretch. Even though our decision-making wasn’t as good as it should have been, it just seemed like we kept com-ing back.”
Florida will face James Madison in the 
Elite Eight on Sunday at 4 p.m. Butler knows her team will need to improve to earn an-other victory. 
“We’ve got to play a much better ball 
game up there if we expect to continue to advance,” she said.

Briana Little stepped up to the plate with 
the bases loaded in the bottom of the eighth 
inning. Florida’s potential 10th straight vic-tory against rival Florida State was on the line.
Little watched two pitches go by before 
launching a 1-1 offering over the Katie Seas-hole Pressly Stadium scoreboard to win the game 7-3 for No. 3 Florida (32-3, 7-2 South-eastern Conference) in front of a record crowd of 2,443. The homer was Little’s sixth of the season and her third career grand slam.
“I saw it off the bat, 
and I sprinted,” Little said. “Usually you trot; I 
just sprinted. I was so excited.”
Little’s trip around the diamond wasn’t 
planned. Extra innings were unexpected.The Gators had trouble getting the bat on 
the ball for the first seven innings. Florida only plated one run through the first six in-nings, and it came on a passed ball. When UF did get runners on base, batters could do nothing against FSU starter Lacey Waldrop’s off-speed pitches.
Florida loaded the bases in the sixth after 
Kelsey Horton reached base on a throwing error by Florida State third baseman Court-ney Senas. Stephanie Tofft walked and Tay-lor Schwarz was hit by a pitch, but Ensley Gammel and Bailey Castro both struck out to end the inning and Florida’s momentum.
Freshmen Kelsey Stewart and Kirsti Mer-
ritt went down in short order to begin the seventh, and it looked like the Gators win-ning streak would come to an end. Haeger and Little drew walks, bringing Horton to the plate.
Horton hit a weak ground ball to Senas 
at third base. Senas took a step towards first 
Gators rally for 7-3 victory against Seminoles in extra innings“Obviously very, very proud of 
our toughness and our fight and 
resilience.”

END OF GREGULATION
  Billy Donovan probably isn’t 
going anywhere. But he has to at least think about the open-
ing at UCLA, right? 
  The reasons he won’t leave are 
fairly obvious. According to USA Today, his total pay of $3,639,800 for the 2011-12 season ranked be-hind only Kentucky’s John Calipari, Louisville’s Rick Pitino and Duke’s Mike Krzyzewski. Donovan has had nothing but glowing things to say about living in Gainesville. His oldest son, Billy, plays for UF and will be eligible through 2014. His youngest son, Connor, is still a few years away from high school. His 72-year-old father, William, coaches the seventh and eighth grade bas-ketball team at Gainesville’s Queen of Peace Academy. The UF practice facility underwent a $1.8 million renovation in Sept. 2007. Athletics Director Jeremy Foley has shown a commitment to winning and build-ing a successful program. Very few coaches have ever won a national championship, let alone two, at one school before choosing to leave for another. Donovan spent ﬁ  ve years as an assistant at Kentucky, so UK would make sense as his dream job. But, when the position opened in 2007 and 2009, Donovan publicly shot down the rumors.  
  The job of Florida’s men’s basket-
ball coach is a great one, especially for Billy Donovan. 
  But Donovan is in his 17th season 
at Florida. He’s only 47 years old, so he could easily have another 20 years left. Do we really expect that he’ll be the coach at UF for 37 seasons? 
  Jim Boeheim, the longest-ten-
ured coach in the NCAA, is about to ﬁ  nish his 37th year at Syracuse.     Krzyzewski is in his 33rd season. Judging by their success, lengthy tenures aren’t unreasonable. But coaching at Syracuse or Duke is dif-ferent from coaching at Florida. 
  Trying to rank the most desirable 
jobs in college basketball would do little more than make people angry, but there’s a pretty solid top tier. In alphabetical order: Duke, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, North Carolina, Syracuse and UCLA. 
  You can make arguments for 
a few others, but there aren’t any false positives on that list.   Those programs have all won at least 1,700 games. Florida has won 1,293. 
  With the exception of Duke, 
which plays at historic Cameron Indoor, each program’s stadium holds more fans than the O’Connell Center. With all due respect to the O’Dome, each is considerably nicer and/or more storied. 
  National attention and prestige 
are a given at each of those seven, and every recruit is within reach. 
  An opportunity to coach one of 
those teams rarely arises. Since the NCAA Tournament ﬁ  eld expanded in 1985, those programs have held a combined 16 coaching searches. 
  Calipari, Indiana’s Tom Crean 
and Kansas’ Bill Self ﬁ  gure to be around for a while. Whoever UCLA hires should get at least three or four years. UNC’s Roy Williams is 62, Krzyzewski is 66 and Boeheim is 68, so those jobs could open in the fore-seeable future. That being said, each coach will be around for howev-er long he wants. 
  So the 
U C L A opening  could be 
one of very few chances for Dono-van. And what an opportunity it is, even compared to what he has now. 
  UCLA won 10 championships 
before Florida even reached the NCAA Tournament. 
  John Wooden and his Pyramid 
of Success came from UCLA. Dono-van is already far and away the most successful coach in UF’s history. 
  UCLA produced Kareem Abdul-
Jabbar, the NBA’s all-time leading scorer. Joakim Noah and Al Horford may be the two best players UF has ever had.  
  From 2003-2014, the state of 
Florida did not once produce more Rivals 150 recruits than California. The states tied once, in 2010. Over-all, California produced 158 top-150 players against Florida’s 98.  
  Of course, the reason there’s an 
opening at UCLA is the same rea-son the job may not be all that desir-able. Ben Howland was ﬁ  red after making seven NCAA Tournaments and three Final Fours in 10 years. Recruiting well enough to nab Sha-bazz Muhammad, the No. 1 overall player in the class of 2012, wasn’t enough to save him. 
  The standards are unreasonably 
high. If you don’t win — and win in entertaining fashion — Bill Walton will lead a throng of people publicly trashing you. Fixing the recent dip in attendance might take more than a new coach. 
  Still, the allure of such a legend-
ary program has to be hard to deny. 
  The coaching search that would 
ensue if Donovan left says a lot about the state of UF’s program. 
  Florida would probably target 
Alabama coach Anthony Grant, as it did when Donovan brieﬂ  y left to coach the Orlando Magic in 2007. 
  UF would likely have no shot 
at Shaka Smart or Brad Stevens. If Donovan’s replacement made a couple Final Fours and won a title, maybe Florida would be capable of hiring the next generation’s Stevens or Smart. 
  Donovan is a good enough coach 
to permanently elevate the program to an elite level, but he can’t do it alone. Becoming an elite program requires not just a buy-in from those within the program — which he has — but from the fans, too. 
  Even after winning back-to-back 
titles, Donovan and the basketball program will always play second ﬁ  ddle to football. Few pay the hoops team any mind until after the Super Bowl. The O’Connell Center was sold to about 85 percent capacity for November’s marquee nonconfer-ence games against Marquette and Wisconsin, but in reality the build-ing was no more than two-thirds full. 
  Even in March, the football 
team’s meaningless spring practices receive nearly equal coverage. 
  Donovan doesn’t strike me as a 
selﬁ  sh, egocentric man. Far from it. 
  But anyone who takes his job se-
riously and strives to be successful values prestige, respect and, to some extent, recognition. 
  If I were so lucky to write for 
the Gainesville Sun, I’d leave in a heartbeat if offered a job at the L.A. Times. Even if I loved Gainesville and would be covering the same sport for the same wages. The Sun has a circulation of 215,000 and has won two Pulitzers. The Times has a circulation of 572,998 and has won 39 Pulitzers. I’d want to work under that banner, with those people, in the place so many great writers have worked before. 
  In the same way, you’d rather 
play for the Lakers than the Magic. To perform in the Dolby Theatre rather than the Hippodrome. To curate at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art rather than the Harn Museum.
  Even if the UCLA job isn’t right 
for Donovan, the point remains that certain jobs have more to offer than UF, especially as it applies to pres-tige and building a legacy. 
  So could you really blame Dono-
van if he someday wanted to leave?

Coach Billy Donovan watches from the bench during Florida’s 66-40 
win against Vanderbilt on March 6 in the O’Connell Center.
Gators batters struck out 20 times
and ﬁ  red the ball over ﬁ  rst baseman Victo-
ria East’s head. Haeger and Little both came around to score, tying the game in improbable fashion.
  “(I was) just trying to hustle to ﬁ  rst,” Horton 
said. “Obviously, that’s not what I want to do. … (I’m) happy it worked out the way it did.”
  The Gators loaded the bases later in the in-
ning, but catcher Aubree Munro struck out to end the seventh, setting the stage for Little to win the game in extras.
  “They looked like a bunch of piranhas in the 
dugout,” coach Tim Walton said. “They were ready to attack. And you could see that we got an opportunity, and they were ready to take full advantage of that.”
  “Even though the score is 7-3, we all know 
that’s probably a 1-1 tie ballgame. Both teams had a couple of miscues.”
  Before Little’s grand slam, all of Florida’s 
runs were unearned as pitchers Hannah Rog-ers and Waldrop dueled. Waldrop struck out 18 Gators in 6.2 innings.
  Before the error on Senas in the seventh 
inning, Waldrop had al-lowed only six balls to enter play. 
  “She took advantage 
of some of us with some of her pitches,” Wal-ton said. “That was more great pitching than bad at-bats.”
  The win was Florida’s second straight walk-
off victory and ﬁ  fth of the season. Three of the game-winning hits were home runs.  
  “We always ﬁ  ght,” Little said. “We don’t sit 
down and let it just happen. We’re going to go out with a ﬁ  ght, no matter what.”
