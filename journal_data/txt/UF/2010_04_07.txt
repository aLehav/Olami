Experts debate validity of major religions
0 THEY SPOKE TO A CROWD
OF ABOUT 1,300.
By CJ PRUNER
Alligator Staff Writer
Although it wasn't their first go-
around, Tuesday's debate between
Christopher Hitchens and Dinesh
D'Souza didn't lack enthusiasm.
Speaking for more than an hour
and a half at the Phillips Center, the
two verbally jousted each other on
the topic of God's existence to an
audience of about 1,300, using vari-
ous topics such as evolution, the
Crusades, Bill Gates and apes on
the nature channel to solidify their
arguments.
Although cordial throughout
the process, the two, who were
paid $33,000 collectively to speak,
couldn't resist bending the rules
of debate decorum, interjecting at
rapid-fire pace despite the efforts of
the moderator, UF religion profes-
sor Manuel Vasquez.

as "What's So Great about Christi-

250 protest shooting
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Writer
Equipped with new chants but the
same purpose, about 250 people crowded
on Turlington Plaza Tuesday afternoon
to protest the University Police Depart-
ment shooting of a UF graduate student.
Kofi Adu-Brempong was shot by of-
ficer Keith Smith on March 2 at his Corry
Village apartment.
Protesters gathered to inform people
about the shooting and express concern
about the administration's response to
the incident.
A similar rally was held March 16,
when protesters marched from Turling-
ton Plaza to Emerson Hall and Tigert
Hall.At Tuesday's rally, marchers held
signs reading "UF show you care for jus-
tice not for $$$" and "We came to study,
not to get shot." One sign, written in the
Ghanaian-language Akan, read "we miss
you Kofi, justice for Kofi."

University police explain
emergency response team
Editor's Note: This is the first segment of
a two-part series describing the teams
employed by the university to respond in
crisis situations.
By MINCH MINCHIN
Alligator Writer
The University of Florida has no
SWAT team.
Instead, the University Police Depart-
ment employs a Critical Incident Re-
sponse Team, or CIRT, that responds to
high-risk emergency situations.
Last month, five UPD officers, includ-
ing members of CIRT, were involved in a
two-hour standoff with Ghanaian gradu-
ate student Kofi Adu-Brempong in CorryVillage.
After posting threatening notes on his
windows and trying to strike police of-
ficers with a metal rod, Adu-Brempong
was shot in the face by UPD officer Keith
Smith with a .223 caliber rifle, according
to a UPD report.
The rifle is part of the standard gear
for members of CIRT.
The CIRT program began in 2002.
About 10 officers are issued CIRT gear at
a time because of budget constraints, said
UPD Lt. Robert Wagner.
Like a SWAT team, CIRT officers are
equipped with semi-automatic rifles,
thick armor vests and helmets, Wagner
said.
Unlike most SWAT teams, members

half of Census forms
0 STUDENT RESPONSE IS
TRADITIONALLY LOW.
ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Staff Writer
Although the 2010 U.S. Cen-
sus only has 10 questions, county
officials are still waiting for Ala-
chua County residents to stand
up and be counted.
Norman Sassner, a U.S. Cen-
sus office manager, said about 52
percent of Alachua County resi-
dents have turned in their ques-
tionnaires as of last Thursday.
Data from the census is used
to determine government rep-
resentation and allocation of
funds.
The number of students who
complete the census is tradition-
ally low.
Sassner said students may
not realize they are not counted
in their parents' census and must
fill out their own census.
A larger student response
could mean schools and univer-sities could receive a larger allo-
cation of funds.
"If they have any love for
their university, they should par-
ticipate," he said
Alachua County City Man-
ager Randall Reid said there is
still a need for a higher student
turnout.
"We're concerned because
students have a huge political
impact in Alachua County,"
Reid said. "There are millions of
dollars at stake."
Reid said it's also important
for foreign studentsLocal to participate in theN ews census.
Sassner is hope-
ful the county can surpass the 62
percent turnout from 2000.
He attributes his optimism to
efforts made by the Census Com-
plete Count Committee, which
informs people about the census.
For Reid, the message is clear:
Students need to contribute.
"It may be lying on the coun-
ter or the coffee table, but they
need to get it in," he said.

Bad Bill
Senate Bill 6 harms
Florida's teachers
ven with all the responsibilities on their plates, Florida
teachers need to keep on their toes with Senate Bill
hovering over their heads.
The bill would tie teacher pay to test scores and eliminate
the possibility of tenure. With the move, teachers would join
the rest of the world, introducing them to the constant fight
for jobs, where performance matters more than experience.
While the move to stop seasoned educators from resting
on their laurels seems like a step in the right direction, tying
FCAT scores to their pay would be madness.
Teachers who have no capacity to teach could still keep
their jobs, provided with a bright class of motivated stu-
dents.
And the opposite could happen if a good teacher worked
in an underachieving school.
Given this scenario, inner-city schools would once again
lose. What teacher would risk a job to take a chance on the
students who need the most help?
Florida lawmakers cannot expect teachers to sacrifice
higher pay and job security for the greater social good. After
all, the legislators don't even do that themselves.
If you're wondering why Senate Bill 6 matters to all Flo-
ridians, consider the results. Teachers would move to the
other 49 states for tenure and, often, higher pay. The educa-
tors who choose to stay would quickly mold students' mal-
leable minds into test-taking slot machines used to gamble
on the FCAT.
These possibilities don't bode well for the state's ailing
economy, so here's to hoping the legislature gets a little
smarter about education.
Tea-bags
hate to keep writ-ing about the ridic-
ulous antics of the
Tea Party because it makes
us worried that any discus-
sion of them will give them
more power. That said, we
thought about it but decided
that shining a light on all of
their insane behaviors is bet-
ter than being afraid to talk
about them.
At a recent Tea Party
event, aside from attempting
to organize a protest of tax
day and begging for money,
organizer Vince DiCello held
up a picture of President
Obama with his shoes off,
claiming that this was some-
how evidence of his secret
Islam faith. That's right. You
should be groaning.
No one seems to be able to
prove how this picture makes
Obama a Muslim. While Mus-
lims do take off their shoesto pray, which is something
Christians don't necessarily
have to do, there is absolutely
nothing in the picture to give
any indication that the presi-
dent took off his shoes for the
purpose of prayer.
Perhaps he should merely
leave his shoes on until he
goes to sleep if every time an
image of him, say, relaxing
shoeless in his home surfaces,
these nuts will be convinced
of his betrayal. We do not
wish to bore you with an-
other editorial about the Tea
Party.
But what we do hope
is that every time you hear
about one of these crazy
"scandals" created by fear,
prejudice and hate, you begin
to see the Tea Party for what
it really is: a group of angry,
crazy people who will do ab-
solutely anything to create a
scene.

Registration for this game is double that of
February's game. But, not you. No, you're
too busy hating others who are breathing
way too much of your oxygen as they run
past you with grins, Nerf guns and fake
blood on their faces. So guy, pull the stick
out, have a little fun, and purge the green
monster from your soul or you will be for-
ever unhappy -a fate worse than being
an actual zombie.

U. MEditorial made too big of deal out of
Humans v Zombies
I was thrilled to find myself chuckling
at reading the editorial on the Humans vs.
Zombies game. Even players should have
a laugh at their nominated status, as if life
as we know it veered into some off-beat
version of "Revenge of the Nerds," and the
writer somehow imagined himself as the
jock on campus (though said writer may
not laugh when jocks get zombie fever,
too).
The epic generalization of "socially
stunted children" was the best attribute,
traversing the bounds of witticism about
as far as one can stretch a rubber band.
Sadly, the writer gave him/herself away
with the overabundant knowledge of
geekdom, leading readers to wonder just
where he or she stands in "this mysterious
herd of humanity."
Here's a thought: Everyone knows that
person in a crowd who is a little too wor-
ried about not being taken seriously and
acts like a total diva whenever teased. You
know, the type whose face would crack
and fall off before laughing at a joke just to
prove how above-it-all he really is?
This is the type that has so handicapped
his own ability to have fun that the sight
of anyone enjoying themselves in a silly,
stress-busting game of pop culture tag in-
cites a jealous rage and a curious need to
make a bigger deal out of it than the geekygainers themselves.

Students should consider working for the federal governmentIt's just about that time of year again. If you are an under-
classman like me, the economy is still looking down and
you could use a well-paying internship or job to get you
through the summer. For those UF seniors about to enter the
real world, the job market is looking especially rough.
But before you start applying for a job at the local Mickey
D's or resign yourself to playing Xbox 360 for the duration of
summer (and possibly beyond), you should look at a unique
and fulfilling job opportunity-interning or working for the
federal government.
Whatever your major or area of interest is, there is defi-
nitely a job for you. Whether you are an engineer who wants
to work for the Department of Transportation or a political
science major whose dream internship is with the Central
Intelligence Agency, the perfect internship or job awaits
you, and the time to apply is now. All federal agencies are
hiring both interns and full-time employees.Not only are the feds hiring, there
are innumerable benefits to working
for the American people. Pay is com-
petitive with the private sector, and
you can start off making as much as
$42,000 a year with just a bachelor's
Kyle Robisch degree. Interns are paid very well,
making as much as $15 to $20 per
Speak king Out hour. All federal employees get health
insurance, a pension plan and start off
with more than three weeks of vacation time a year. Not in-
terested in working in Washington, D.C., and want to stay
in the Southeast? More than 15 percent of federal jobs are
located in our region of the country and more than three out
of four federal jobs are located outside of the Washington,
D.C., metro area.
Even if your ultimate career goal is in the private sector,working for the federal government can get you there. Many
employers seek to hire those with government experience.
Government service is also some of the most exciting work
in any field and gives you an opportunity to work in a ca-
pacity that serves others in a way other careers might not be
able to. It is also important to note that federal service is non-
partisan. Whatever your political stripes, federal service has
the opportunity to further your career and serve others.
And don't worry -federal interns and employees usu-
ally only work 40 hours a week, so you'll still have plenty of
time to watch baseball or play Call of Duty 2 this summer.
Kyle Robisch is a Federal Service Student Ambassador with
the Partnership for Public Service, a non-partisan, non-profit
organization that works to inspire a new generation of talented
Americans to serve in federal positions. He has interned for the
Department of Homeland Security and the Environmental Protec-
tion Agency.

Campuses compete for Pink
H IT STARTED WITH 59 UNIVERSITIES.
By CHRISTINA STINE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Although March Madness is over, another
bracket battle is brewing on college campuses.
Victoria's Secret's Pink Nation Collegiate Show-
down, whichbegan on March17 with a preliminary
round, will be deciding the final four competitors
today. The Fabulous Four round runs from today
until Tuesday.
At press time, UF had the most votes, the next
highest being the University of Washington, which
has about 1,500 less votes.
"It started out with just a few friends, and nowthousands of people know about it and vote every
day," said Kahla Sansom, who created a Facebook
group for the event and posted fliers.
The showdown started with 59 colleges in a
bracket. Schools are paired against each other, and
voting is closed in weekly intervals to determine
which universities move on to the next round.
Jamie Blacker, UF Pink campus representative
and UF advertising senior said the
On 2010 winning university will get a
Campus concert and party with freebies.
Students will be able to vote on
which bands they want to perform,
Blacker said.
"The boys should also vote because the Victo-
ria's Secret models will be here if we win," Blacker
said.

More than 600 wings and 16
trays of desserts awaited visi-
tors to the Chicken Wing Charity
Thing Tuesday.
The UF Interfraternity Coun-
cil and the Panhellenic Council
teamed up to host the event at
Flavet Field.
Twenty-six fraternities and 16
sororities participated, and about
1,000 people attended. The en-
trance fee was $5 per person.
The organizations raised a lit-
tle more than $5,000 for the Boys
& Girls Club of Alachua County.
Each fraternity donated wings
and each sorority donated a des-
sert. Organizers held a contestto see which wings and desserts
were the best.
The panel of judges included
UF basketball player Erving
Walker, UF running back Chris
Rainey, UF Dazzler dancer
Marisa Dunkel and UF adminis-
trator Nancy Chrystal-Green.

The winners received a gift
card to a local restaurant.The organizations advertised
the event over Facebook to en-

"We opened it up for the
whole community," said Rajiv

"The purpose is to show every-
one that we are looking to benefit
a good cause," he said.

SG allocates more money to student organizations
0 THEY APPROVED A
$640,052 BUDGET.
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Student senators passed a bill al-
locating more money to student or-
ganizations during Tuesday night's
Senate meeting.
They approved the 2010-2011Student Government-funded orga-
nizationalbudget of $640,052, which
helps fund student organizations.
They also passed a bill allocating
$569,602 for the academics budget,
which provides funding for aca-
demic departments and programs.
The total Student Government
budget for the 2010-2011 academic
year is about $14.4 million.
Budget and Appropriations
committee chairman T.J. Villamilsaid each student organization re-
ceived a 2.5 percent increase in its
base budget, and more money was
given back to student organizations
from the Accent
Government and StudentGovernment
Productions co-
sponsorship budget.
"All the student groups were re-
ally happy with what they got," Vil-
lamil said.Senators also passed a resolution
condemning the members of West-
boro Baptist Church, who are plan-
ning to visit UF and Gainesville on
April 18.
The church, which is based in
Kansas, travels across the country to
protest and condemn groups such
as homosexuals, Jews, Muslims,
African Americans and American
soldiers.
Student Alliance Sen. Alan Ya-nuck, an author of the bill, said pass-
ing the resolution is a peaceful pro-
test to the church's message.
"We are going to be everything
they aren't," Yanuck said.
Senators went on to pass a resolu-
tion ratifying the graduate students'
Statement of Principles, which is the
equivalent of a graduate student bill
of rights, and outlines topics such
as graduate student-and-professor
relations.
The crowd marched to the UPD office

Plaza on Tuesday afternoon.PROTEST, from page 1
ministration.
On the way, the protestors chanted, "Cam-
pus cops, it's not your place to shoot a student
in the face."
They were met by Dave Kratzer, associate
vice president of student affairs, who accepted
their demands.
"I hear you loud and clear," Kratzer said.
Kratzer helped schedule a meeting Thurs-
day between rally organizers and Brian Beach,
the senior vice president for administration and
business ventures.
The protesters' demands included dropping
charges against Kofi and creating a civilian re-
view board to oversee UPD force policy. A new
demand added since the last protest calls for
the liquidation of the Critical Incident Response
Team, a group of regular officers equipped with
assault rifles.
The crowd continued to UPD headquarters
on Museum Road, taking up the right lane of
Southwest 13th Street and holding back traffic
as it marched down Museum Road.
Lt. Robert Wagner met the crowd there and
handed out about 140 official complaint forms,which would allow protesters to express their
concerns about the shooting.
Wagner said the complaints would more
than likely be treated collectively because they
deal with the same situation.
"We have to do this, there's no
choice. We'll drag the university
through the mud."
Dave Schneider
rally organizer
The complaints will be addressed formally
after the release of the shooting investigation
reports.
Before leaving, marchers were encouraged
to call the state attorney's office and the UF ad-
ministration with their demands and to join the
Justice for Kofi Facebook group or donate to the
Justice for Kofi Fund.
Dave Schneider, the rally's organizer, said
he thought the protest went well but vowed not
to decrease the pressure on UF until demands
were met.
"We have to do this, there's no choice," he
said. "We'll drag the university through the
mud."

Hospital, not the Richard Dawkins
Hospital," he said.
Hitchens, author of works such
as "God is Not Great: How Religion
Poisons Everything," countered
with the notion that the concept of
a personal god is inconceivable and
stands contrary to reason.
"People who want that kind of
authority I think condemn us to
a never-ending celestial totalitar-
ian dictatorship," Hitchens said. "I
don't believe in a god and I don't
believe he owes me an explana-
tion. it's ridiculous,"
The two wrestled with topics
ranging from the role of God in sci-
ence, religion's role on society and
the prospects of the afterlife.
According to D'Souza, atheists
fail to provide answer to some of
life's most important questions,
such as life's origin and purpose.
For Hitchens, religious advo-
cates do humanity a disservice bytrying to promote their beliefs.
"Shouldn't it make you happy
you have a personal experience
with Jesus of Nazareth; get over it,"
he said.
"I don't believe in a god
and I don't believe he owes
me an explanation. it's
ridiculous."
Christopher Hitchens

Emotions hit a new level dur-
ing the Q-and-A session when one
of the audience members had to be
escorted out when he publicly chas-
tised Hitchens, calling him "Satan"
and a "traitor to the left."
Hitchens, who was never short
of quips throughout the night, re-
lieved the tension with his dry hu-
mor.

level of the society you joined," he

No additional training except rifle certification is required for CIRT officers
UPD, from page 1
of CIRT do not exclusively handle emer-
gency situations.
Most of the time, CIRT members work
as regular police officers. They provide
campus security, break up underage drink-
ing parties and issue parking tickets.
The possession of additional gear is the
only difference between CIRT members
and normal UPD officers, Wagner said. No
additional training is required for CIRT,
except rifle certification, he said.
"I hate that it's called a team," he said.
"It's not a SWAT team in any way, shapeor form."
At least two CIRT officers are on patrol
during every shift, he said, though not all
CIRT officers are assigned to patrol. Some
have worked in the investigation division,
community services division or in train-
ing, Wagner said.
While on patrol, the helmets, rifles and
vests remain in the backs of the police cars
until they are needed.
Whenever the police radio dispatch
describes a difficult situation, CIRT mem-
bers are expected to "jump the call," he
said, and drive to the scene.
All UPD officers, and therefore all
members of CIRT, are trained to the samelevel as the Gainesville Police Department
officers, said UF President Bernie Machen
in a phone interview.
Both GPD and the Alachua County
Sheriff's Office have SWAT teams that
have jurisdiction to help on campus if nec-
essary.
The UPD CIRT is only oneOn of several team-based orga-
nizations related to the Adu-
Brempong incident.
It should not be confused with the UF
Critical Response Team or the Crisis Iden-
tification Response Team, both of which
are organizations to promote mental health
among students. They are part of the UFDean of Students Office and the Counsel-
ing and Wellness Center.
Additionally, the Crisis Intervention
Team is a third-party training course de-
signed to teach police officers about men-
tal health issues. The Crisis Intervention
Team is associated with the National Alli-
ance on Mental Illness.
Although several of the officers who
were present in Adu-Brempong's apart-
ment at the time of the shooting had un-
dergone CIT training, the shooter, Keith
Smith had not been through the course,
said Bruce Stevens, the co-president of
Gainesville's National Alliance on Mental
Illness chapter.

Relievers pitch Gators to win over Jacksonville
0 FOUR BULLPEN HURLERS COM-
BINED FOR SIX SCORELESS INNINGS.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator org
For the second-straight midweek game,
UF coach Kevin O'Sullivan decided to rely
on his bullpen.
This time it worked.
The Gators started Jeff Barfield and used
five other relief pitchers in a loss to FSU on
March 30.
But the relievers came through the second
time around as they limited Jacksonville (16-
14) to just six hits as No. 8 Florida (21-7) beat
the Dolphins 12-2 Tuesday.
O'Sullivan gave struggling Greg Larson,
who usually comes out of the bullpen and
has been sidelined due to elbow tendinitis
since March 24, the second start of his career.
The sophomore came into the game with a
12.54 ERA, but it didn't show.
"It felt good to get back out there," Larson
said. "[O'Sullivan] had me on a pre-deter-
mined pitch count (40 pitches), so he took me
out early."
He lasted three innings and allowed two
runs, both unearned, while striking out two.
From there, four bullpen pitchers teamed
up to throw six scoreless innings.
"Today worked out perfectly because no-
body really got extended, so you still have
them fresh for Friday," O'Sullivan said. "If
you were going to draw up a Tuesday game,
this went exactly the way you want it to."
After being shut out for the first time this
season Sunday, Florida's offense got back on
track as it scored 10 of its 12 runs with two
outs.
"[Two-out hits have] kind of been our
motto -last year we did it a lot," O'Sullivan
said. "We haven't done that much this year,
we've been leaving a lot stranded. Hopefully
this is a step in the right direction."
Right fielder Jonathan Pigott got it started
in the second with a two-out triple to driveUF's Greg Larson pitches during the Gators' 12-2 win over Jacksonville in McKethan Stadium on Tuesday night. Larson, who nor-
mally comes out of the bullpen, got the start against the Dolphins and allowed two unearned runs in three innings of work.
in two runs and give the Gators an early 2-0 senior Matt den Dekker. The Gators broke open a 5-2 game with a
lead. Zunino snapped out of his 2-for-35 slump five-run sixth capped off by a wild pitch that
Florida displayed a different aspect of its with a two-hit performance to go along with allowed den Dekker to score from second.

Florida's defense in search of new identity, playmakers
The unit lost six starters from last year
By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer
pkegler@a Iligator org
It is a confession few players are
willing to make, especially in col-
lege.
Then again, the first step in fixing
a bad habit is admitting the prob-
lem."Last year, I took a lot of plays
off," safety Will Hill said. "I have a
lot of emphasis on that right now."
And those words came from a
rising junior who ranked sixth on the
team in tackles last season as part of
one of the best defenses in the coun-
try. This spring has featured plenty
of turnover on the defense, from the
players to the coaches.Six defensive starters from the
Sugar Bowl are no longer here.
There are two new
coaches -including
a coordinator -on
that side of the ball.
Football This year's de-
fense has put an ex-
tra emphasis on effort this spring.
Hill realizes he is a definite start-er this fall. The past two seasons he
was called a "starter" along with fel-
low safeties Ahmad Black and Ma-
jor Wright, but Hill seemed to take a
backseat to those two. With Wright
headed to the NFL Draft, the young-
er defensive backs are looking up to
Hill as he used to do to others.
Defensive coordinator Teryl Aus-
tin has only been on the job for a few
months, but he said he saw lapses of
effort on tape some. He has stressed
it this spring, though, and has seenpositive returns so far.
"It's starting to show. He's taking
more of a leadership role," Austin
said. "He's kind of a quiet guy, but
when you watch him, he's doing ev-
erything 100 miles per hour."
The UF defense also has two
holes to fill in the middle with Ryan
Stamper and Brandon Spikes no
longer around. Besides being two of
the best players, Stamper and Spikes
were veteran leaders.

E As if WR Charles Rogers' NFL career wasn't bad enough, a judge ruled he has
to repay the Detroit Lions $6.1 million. The one good thing to come out of his
career was his commercial before the 2003 draft. .Broncos QB Kyle Orton likes

No. 10 Gators
fall to second
STAFF REPORT
The Florida men's golf team could not keep up the blister-
ing pace it got off to in the first round of the BancorpSouth In-
tercollegiate Tournament, when it finished with the best score
of any round of the event with a 272.
The No. 10 Gators scored a 289 and 286 in the second and
third round, respectively, allowing North Florida to pass them
for first place Tuesday in their last regular-season competition.
The Gators finished in second place and carded a three-
round total of 847 (272-289-286, -17), one shot behind the Os-
preys. UF got solid scores from all but one of its golfers.
Freshman Tommy Mou tied for 62nd out of 75 in the tour-
nament with a 12-over par.
Florida has struggled all year to find five
golfers it can count on for solid scores and might
still be searching for the right lineup with the
postseason coming up next.
Golf The next-worst finisher for the Gators behind
Mou was freshman Phillip Choi, who tied for
28th with a four-over par.
Seniors Tyson Alexander and Tim McKenney did all they
could to pull out a win for the Gators. Both shot season-best
scores to finish in first and second place.
Alexander claimed the first individual title of his collegiate
career, shooting 11-under par.
McKenney, who was leading Alexander by one stroke head-
ing into the final round, scored an even-par while his team-
mates put up a two-under. McKenney's tournament score of
206 (-10) was still good enough for his career-best result.
Rounding out the group for UF was junior Bank Vongvanij,
who finished in a tie for 17th with a 54-hole score of 217 (72-
72-73,+1).Hicks taking on bigger leadership role
FOOTBALL, from page 17
One of the people who will likely
be called upon to fill such a role is
rising senior Brandon Hicks. He fin-
ished third on the team with four
sacks last season behind only UF's
starting defensive ends, Carlos Dun-
lap and Jermaine Cunningham. He
could see more of an outside rush-
ing role if the Gators implement
more 3-4 action into their gameplan.
"It's a big responsibility because
everybody's looking at you," Hicks
said. "Everybody's going to evalu-
ate you and see how you play.
"I want to be that person that ev-
erybody looks to for that energy and
motivation."
While meaning no disrespect
to those who have left, Hicks isn't
worried about a falloff in this year's
group, and he doesn't believe the
unit's identity will be any different.
"It isn't going to change because
one man is gone," Hicks said. "It's
another opportunity for anther man
to step in his place."
This spring likely won't provide
all the answers for the Gators be-
cause there are still nine incoming
freshmen who won't hit the practice
fields until August.
But Austin believes the spring
will be vitally important in molding
his unit's identity, even if players
are still shifting around and position
battles are ongoing.
"You start it now," Austin said.
"You figure out what kind of team
you're going to be right now."Harrison Diamond/ Alligator Staff

Mahlich coming on strong as NCAAs approach
* SHE HAS TIED HER CA-
REER HIGH ON BARS THE
LAST TWO MEETS.
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
All season, the No. 4 Gators
have talked about how if the team
hopes to win a national title, then
the gymnasts need to peak at the
right time.
Sophomore Elizabeth Mahlich
is doing just that.
In three of the team's last four
meets -including the regular-
season finale against No. 10 Utah
and the Southeastern Conference
Championships -the All-Amer-
ican has tied her collegiate-best
of 9.875 on the uneven bars.
"She's really starting to shine,"
UF coach Rhonda Faehn said. "It's
great because this is the most im-
portant part, and most important
time of the season, and to see her
excelling now is exactly what we
need from her."
Mahlich hasn't just been hit-
ting her competitive stride on the
bars recently. While her 9.875 at
the SEC Championships earned
her third place, she also tallied a
season-high 9.85 at the meet on
balance beam, the same event in
which she earned second-teamAll-America honors as a fresh-
man.
The recent streak of perfor-
mances by Mahlich comes after aslow start to the season for her on
both events.
She failed to make the lineup
for beam four times this year,but her routines in the last two
meets have been two of her best
this season.
And while she has made the

UF sophomore Elizabeth Mahlich didn't make the team's balance beam lineup four times this season,
but after making an adjustment to her routine, she has returned to last year's All-America form.lineup each week, her scores have
shown improvement during the
last month.
Mahlich made alterations in
her routines earlier in the sea-
son that she said she thinks have
helped her scores.
She changed her routine on
the bars to what she performed
last season as a freshman and
added a beat jump to of her beam
routine.
"She has finally found the rou-
tine composition on both events
that suit her best, make her the
most comfortable and that work
best with her talents," Faehn
said. "I think that has given her
confidence, knowing that she's
doing the skills and the routines
that she feels 100 percent confi-
dent in."
That confidence could be cru-
cial for Mahlich and the Gators as
they prepare to make a run at the
national title.
Faehn said it's important for
the team to get at least four really
good scores throughout its line-
ups, and that doing so is what
separates championship teams
from contenders.
"Every team is going to have
one or two great athletes, but it's
the team that has four, five or six
great athletes that's going to win
the title," Faehn said.
JUMPBALL
Orange and Blue Debut: Interesting sneak peak or waste of time?
ho doesn't enjoy sitting ina stadium in 90-degree heat
watching a meaningless
football game?
OK, so maybe that is not the best
question to ask to convince people
they should go to the Orange and
Blue Debut on Saturday.
But despite dealing with the tor-
turous heat, it is still a cool experi-
ence.
Let's face it, the basketball team
has not been exciting since the '04s
left for the NBA, the smaller sports
don't thrill too many people and
Florida has always been and always
will be a football school, so there has
not been much that gets students ex-
cited about around campus since the
end of the football season.
Most fans are probably a little
rusty with some of their cheers and
their Gator Chomps aren't as crisp as
they were in the fall.
The spring game can also be a
good time for most students to learn
the words to the fight song so they
don't have to just mumble through it
come fall.
Also, most Gators fans having
been trying to figure out what to do
on Saturday afternoons and have
a good excuse to be drunk by noon
since the team's last home game.
That's where the spring game
comes in.
Fans get a chance to preview next
year's squad and get a dose of UF
football while also having a reason toA

This year,
even more so
than the last
few, there are
plenty of ques-
tions surround-
ing the Gators
heading into the
next season.
What will the offense look like
with John Brantley running the show
at quarterback?
Who is going to replace all the
starters on the defense?
Does UF have anyone who can
catch Brantley's passes?
Will coach Urban Meyer have a
heart attack on the field?
All of those answers start getting
clearer in the spring, and this is the
fans' chance to see some of those sce-
narios play out on the field.
To most, it won't be the most
exciting thing they've watched in
The Swamp, but it's better than not
watching anything there at all.
Bring your sunscreen, hat and
shades to the game because you are
going to need them, but even with
the heat, the spring game will give
you a taste of next season that you
couldn't get otherwise.
And unlike a real game, if the heat
gets too brutal, you can always just
leave without getting ridiculed by
the people around you, which is why
there is no reason not to at least stop
by the game.feel like the dad telling his son notto drink at the after-party as he
walks out the door for the prom.
I know you're going to do it, but I
still have to try to stop you.
There are far better ways to spend
your time this Saturday than in The
Swamp watching a glorified scrim-
mage.
Just as has been the case the past
few years, you won't see much at the
Orange and Blue Debut.
Someone will make a few cool
plays, and you'll get all excited only
to watch them ride the bench during
the season.
Last year's breakout player was
wide receiver Frankie Hammond,
who tallied 131 yards and two touch-
downs on four catches. His stats dur-
ing the season: four grabs, 57 yards
and one touchdown.
In 2007, Chevon Walker was the
leading rusher with 74 yards and a
score on 14 carries. He finished that
year with 14 yards and more trans-
fers (one) than touchdowns.
I'm not saying the spring game
doesn't serve a purpose. The coaches
need to put their players into a half-
assed game situation and see how
they perform. But in terms of watch-
ability, it should be treated as another
Saturday scrimmage, not a big event.
Coaches have talked all spring
about how they're still searching for
an offensive identity, and they won't
find it this weekend.
The offensive line is batteredwith injuries,
so there won't
b ebe much to see
there. Receiv-
ers Andre De-
bose and ChrisMike MCCall Rainey, the
McCallin' It hopeful new
Like I See It Percy Harvins,mmccall@alligatororg are still a little
dinged up and
probably won't be fully unleashed.
Running back Jeff Demps is with the
track team, and position mate Em-
manuel Moody is dealing with an-
other injury.
And you can't tell much from the
defense until they play a cohesive of-
fense, which it won't face this week-
end.
The only thing I'd be curious
about is to watch new quarterback
John Brantley, but that's what ESPN
and YouTube are for.
I understand if you choose to dis-
regard this advice. You people are
football-starved, and while I wouldn't
attend if I wasn't being paid to, I do
admire your enthusiasm.
This is the same kind of irrational
love for football that makes a few
thousand turn out to watch players
run sprints on Pro Day, and it makes
the atmosphere at games in the fall
one of the best in all of sports.
But for those of you with common
sense, the forecast for Saturday is 76
degrees and sunny. Go enjoy it some-
where other than The Swamp.Editor's Note:
