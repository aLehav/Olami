GatorLink passwords can now 
include dictionary words and are 
valid for a longer period.
UF Information Technology an-
nounced July 8 on Facebook that the password policy had changed, and it went into effect Monday. Accord-ing to UFIT’s Password Complexity Standard Web page, passwords may include words with fewer than four characters. Passwords still must con-tain at least three of four characteris-tics: lowercase letters, uppercase let-ters, numerals or special characters.
Carly Somers, a 21-year-old UF 
marketing senior, said she’s never been concerned with her GatorLink account privacy.
“It’s not like you’re going to be 
able to guess someone’s password just because you can use diction-ary words, considering how many words there are,” she said.
Somers said the policy will have  
positive results because students won’t have to keep memorizing new passwords.
Adrian Diaz, a 20-year-old UF 
aerospace engineering junior, said allowing dictionary words will save students time.
“It took me 10 minutes to come 
up with a password the first time,” he said.

A City of Gainesville plan to collect unpaid parking 
tickets may soon be driving more dollars to the city. 
The tickets, which amount to $622,109, have accumu-
lated since 2008, according to a city memo.
From 2013, about $57,000 worth of parking tickets are 
still unpaid, according to the memo. All unpaid tickets is-
sued prior to 2008 will be written off.
Becky Rountree, city administrative services director, 
said the city is considering hiring a collection agency to take care of unpaid tickets, but it’s carefully considering what company to hire.
“Some [collection agencies] are very aggressive,” she 
said. “We’re trying to find a good balance that will take the work and have practices we are comfortable with.”
Part of the reason for the backlog of tickets is a break-
down in communication between the city and the Depart-ment of Motor Vehicles, Rountree said. 
Both agencies received technology upgrades, but they 
were unable to share information, resulting in a halt in the ticket notification process, Rountree said. 
Now that both systems are working together again, 
Rountree said, letters are being sent out to notify those who have unpaid parking tickets from the five-year pe-riod. 
Typically, Rountree said, if a ticket is unpaid after 72 
hours of being issued, the penalty rises. After a month, the city sends out a reminder. City considers how 
to collect $600K in unpaid parking fees

Dove World Outreach Center has officially flown the 
coop. 
The local ministry that sparked controversy by 
threatening to burn Qurans in 2010 finalized the sale of its 
property to Spirit of Faith ministries July 15.
The Rev. Melanie Guistwite, one of Spirit of Faith’s 
pastors, said the church will begin renovating the two buildings on the 20-acre property located at 5805 NW 37th St.
“We’re just going to do a complete 
overhaul of the existing buildings,” she said. 
Spirit of Faith’s grand opening 
celebration is scheduled for the weekend 
of Sept. 14 and 15.
Terry Jones, the leader of Dove 
ministries, said the property sold for 
about $1.2 million.
Jones said the sale went smoothly but took longer than he hoped.
“There actually wasn’t anything that came up at the 
last minute,” he said. “Everything went very well. For a project of this size, it just takes a lot of time.”
For now, Jones said he is searching for a place to replant 
his ministry in the Tampa/St. Petersburg area. 
“We definitely have been looking, and in fact, have 
contacted for a facility in that area,” he said.
Spirit of Faith, which formerly met at the Phillips 
Center for the Performing Arts, will continue holding services at 1414 NE 23rd Ave. until September.Dove World Outreach sells property, prepares to move

Officials: NM mom struck by 
lightning, gives birth 
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. — A 
pregnant New Mexico woman 
has survived a bolt from the blue to give birth to a bouncing baby girl.
Authorities said Kendra Vil-
lanueva and the baby’s father Ian Gordon were watching ﬁ  reworks with friends on July Fourth when lightning struck both of them in the front yard.
KRQE-TV reported Villanueva 
was just weeks from her due date and had an emergency cesarean section. Mother, father and baby survived relatively unscathed.
The couple named the baby 
Kimberly Samantha Rose Gordon and said they’ll also call her “little Flash Gordon.”
Ian Gordon said the new par-
ents are hoping their new daugh-ter will “run fast, or save the uni-verse.”

For residents who have more than three unpaid 
tickets, the city has implemented a system that 
sends a notiﬁ  cation to the DMV and blocks them from renewing vehicle tags until the ﬁ  nes are paid, Rountree said.
Collecting the tickets, Commissioner Thomas 
Hawkins said, is important because it can provide funds to create additional parking.
“It costs money to provide parking,” he said. “If you don’t pay to park, we’re going to ask you to pay your ticket.”
Brian Smith, a 38-year-old Gainesville resident 
and engineer, said although he thinks collection agencies could be a good solution to help the city get its money, he said he’s critical of some of the reasons the city issues parking tickets. 
“I don’t have a problem with them turning it 
over to a collection agency,” he said. “People legiti-mately owe them money. What I do have a problem with is the ludicrous reasons for issuing parking tickets.”

People can explore job and 
internship opportunities at 
tonight’s Start Up Downtown, the ﬁ  rst Gainesville job fair of its kind.
The event will run from 
6 p.m. to 9 p.m. and will be located on the second-ﬂ  oor balcony at Union Street Station, 201 SE Second Ave.
Start Up Downtown will 
focus on connecting residents with jobs and internships at budding Gainesville businesses. 
It will also allow local 
start-up companies to showcase products they have been creating.
Attendees can network 
with representatives from a variety of young companies in Gainesville, including Grooveshark and Study Edge. 
A full list of 
participating businesses can be found at www.FWStartUpDowntown.eventbrite.com.
Free parking will be 
available at the parking garage across from Union Street Station with ticket validation provided at the event, said Linda McGurn, owner of McGurn Investment Company, which provided the event venue. 
Residents interested in 
attending the fair can register online prior to the event at www.EmployFlorida.com, said Kim Tesch-Vaught, executive director of FloridaWorks. 
Registering online will 
give participating companies the ability to reach out to prospective employees in the future, she said. 
David Nassau, founder 
and president of Hopping 4 a Cure, said that the job fair will be unique for the area.
Many of the start-ups are 
run by students, he said, which creates a more personal connection and a different level of commitment than a corporate job or internship.
Tesch-Vaught agreed. “You’re not just another 
resume in a folder,” Tesch-Vaught said. “That’s what’s so cool about it.”
The event is hosted by the

� UF’S TEAM WON $3,000.
 ALEXA VOLLAND
Alligator Staff Writer avolland@alligator.org
UF’s robotic boat is a world champion.
UF’s team, PropaGator, won first place in 
the International RoboBoat Competition last week.
The engineering competition, hosted by the 
Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems In-ternational, was a six-day team challenge held in Virginia. Boats had to perform several tasks and overcome obstacles. The PropaGator dis-placed 115 pounds of water and was 72 inches by 30 inches by 28 inches.
The team of UF students spent eight months 
and about 5,000 hours working on the boat, but team leader Andrew Gray said the stress was worth it.
“Everything we did was a little challenge in 
itself,” said the 29-year-old electrical and com-puter engineering graduate student.
The team had originally planned to enter a 
robotic lawn mower competition, but it had to switch gears to build a boat when the mower competition was canceled.
“We really had no experience going into 
this competition,” Gray said.
Because the boats are autonomous, Gray said where the boat goes is completely depen-dent on the computer programming — not a remote control.
It’s like being a parent on the sidelines of a 
child’s soccer game, Gray said — once it was on the field, there was nothing he could do.
UF’s team was awarded $3,000 for winning 
first place. Gray said the money will go into funding other projects and paying off debts from the competition.
Eric Schwartz, associate director for UF’s 
Machine Intelligence Lab and the team’s fac-ulty advisor, said the boat is worth between $14,000 and $15,000, but because the team used donated parts, Schwartz said, it spent about $6,000 on the boat for this competition.
He said the skills students learn through 
projects like the boat that prepare them for their careers.
“What they learn they won’t get in any oth-
er class; this is real engineering,” he said. “The classroom teaches you a bunch of fun facts, and in the labs you build on those facts. There’s no better way to learn material than to use it.”Ro, ro, robot boat wins first place

Rain may make people want to hide 
away, but for Gainesville pests, it’s the 
opposite.
Small organisms will wither if con-
ditions are dry, so rainfall indirectly allows them to be more active, John Capinera, chairman of UF’s entomol-ogy and nematology department, wrote in an email. This is especially true with mosquitoes.
Capinera said mosquitoes are the in-
sects most affected by rain because the larvae need temporary water to live.
“The mosquito is considered the 
most dangerous animal in the world right now because they carry so many diseases,” said Rebecca Baldwin, UF assistant professor and undergradu-ate coordinator in the entomology and nematology department.
The West Nile virus, she said, is a 
common disease in Florida that mos-quitoes transmit to humans.
People should worry about mosqui-toes carrying Encephalitis and Dengue, Associate Extension Scientist Jennifer Gillett-Kaufman said. She said the lar-vae look like worms and to check any standing water in the yard because that’s where mosquitoes often breed. 
The best way to 
deal with mosqui-toes, Capinera said, is to avoid them by not being outside during dusk — their most ac-tive time.
“Homeowners, in 
addition to avoiding peak activity periods 
of mosquitoes, should make sure that they have window screens in place and they keep doors closed,” Capinera said.
Gillett-Kaufman said during rainy 
periods in Gainesville, people will see cockroaches and little white centipedes because it is more dry indoors, and there is usually food around for them to seek.
“The cleaner your house,” Gillett-
Kaufman said, “the better chance you have of keeping these pests out.”Rainsville brings the bugs

Darts & Laurels
Not long after his brother’s “not guilty” verdict was an-
nounced, Robert Zimmerman Jr. held an interview on Piers Morgan Live. CNN anchor Don Lemon addressed 
Zimmerman with a question we all wanted to hear answered, and Zimmerman didn’t fail to deliver.
“Much has been made about race in this particular case and 
you ... have a unique opportunity ... to address that. What would you like to see happen when it comes to race?“ Zimmerman’s response was “I want to know if it is true ... that Trayvon Martin was looking to procure firearms, was growing marijuana plants ... I want to know that every minor...that would be reaching out in someway for help ... that they have some kind of help.”
It’s wasn’t “We assert that race had nothing to do with 
my brother’s actions, and we’d like to do our best to promote the safety of all children by advocating for the neighborhood watch.” It was something more like what we expected his an-swer to be. For that, we give Robert Zimmerman Jr. this week’s 
first DART.
Along similar lines, Juror B37 was interviewed by Ander-
son Cooper recently. Cooper asked her “Is George Zimmerman somebody you would like to have on a neighborhood watch in your community?” Her response was “If he didn’t go too far.” When Cooper pressed her, she conceded: “I think he was frustrated...I would feel comfortable having George, but I think he’s learned a good lesson.”
That’s scary. Depriving another human being of life unduly, 
especially in the case of killing a child with your own weapon, is not the kind of thing that merits a slap on the wrist. Legal ques-tions aside, this cold and twisted way of thinking about the kill-ing gets Juror B37 a not-on-my-watch DART.
With so many disturbing examples being set right now, it’s 
comforting to know that there are youngsters like Temar Boggs and his friends working on our side. Last week Boggs and his friends were among the first responders when the search began for 5-year-old Jocelyn Rojas. The 15-year-old, on bicycle, pur-sued the car of whom he suspected was the abductor’s. Even-tually, child was released by the driver on the side of the road, where Boggs was able to get her to safety. Boggs said that what he is “just a normal person who did a thing anybody else would do.” And that’s a beautiful thing. We give a thank-you-for-just-being-yourself LAUREL to Temar Boggs.
Finally, the Alligator strives to be as thorough as possible in 
its reporting, which means including the one factor of events that organizations often don’t want to disclose: the price. We al-ways ask the cost, from how much the Accent Speakers Bureau charges, to how much more Bernie Machen got paid after his salary increases, to the cost of the Reitz Union renovations.
And in response, we’ve heard it all before. “We don’t want to 
disclose it.” “It’ll inflate prices for the future.” “The artist wants that information to stay private.” 
We most recently experienced this with Student Govern-
ment Productions, asking what SGP was paying Matt and Kim to play Swampfest. They refused to tell us. Here’s the thing: SGP is funded by your money. We at the Alligator think students de-serve to know how their money is being spent. Is it responsibly? Not to generalize, but if there has to be an excuse, probably not. 
So, we frustratedly throw a the-students-have-a-right-to-
know DART to SGP and anyone else who refuses to disclose 
how it’s being used.

Social media killed the mystery of stars
In recent years, the use of social media outlets by celeb-
rities has increased dramatically. Seemingly just about every big name in the professional sports and enter-
tainment has a Twitter account.
The age of formal press releases through a spokesper-
son is being taken over by 140 character — or fewer — statements via a celebrity’s Twitter feed. Celebrities can now talk to their fans without even getting out of bed. Regardless of where they are — the locker room, the VIP section, the private jet — Twitter has exposed the private lives of our favorite stars.
This unlimited access to a public forum has gotten 
countless celebrities into trouble. Through various off-color posts, we have found out many famous people have no place speaking to millions — regardless of the medium. But, aside from the trouble celebrities have gotten into as a result of social media, I believe social networks, particu-larly Twitter, have ruined the celebrity mystique.
We have gotten so used to seeing the day-to-day lives 
of our favorite celebs played out via social media that we are forgetting, up until just a few years ago, celebrities were about as reachable as the stars in the sky.
But thanks to social media, celebrities aren’t “stars” 
anymore; they’re more like birds. Sure, they can still soar to places out of our reach, but they can also crash into your just-Windexed kitchen window. The “stars” who previ-ously resembled human versions of the celestial bodies they are named for are now throwing themselves at us whether we want them to or not — and personally I don’t want it.
Growing up, I was a huge Michael Jordan fan. I remem-
ber a poster I had hanging in my room that had Jordan soaring over the Earth for a slam dunk. That poster epito-mized what I thought about Michael Jordan at that time — ‘out of this world.’ As far as I was concerned, he was more than human — just as many celebrities were seen prior to the age of social media. Jordan wasn’t posting In-stagram pictures poppin’ bottles at the club after winning cham-pionships. He wasn’t tweeting about watching Shark Week on the Discovery Channel. No one really knew what Jordan did in his spare time. I personally like to think he slept in a hyperbaric chamber and watched nothing on TV but film of his opponents 
— and occasionally Space Jam. The private lives of super-stars were for us to ponder about.
Today, the most accomplished and comparable NBA 
player to Michael Jordan is Kobe Bryant. Bryant was late to the party when he joined Twitter in January. Prior to posting his first tweet, he held relatively the same mys-tique Jordan held as an unattainable celestial body. Within 7 months of joining Twitter, Bryant has already lost that mystique. Former Los Angeles Lakers teammate of Bry-ant’s Dwight Howard chose to leave the Lakers and join the Houston Rockets on July 8. That very same day, Bryant unfollowed Howard on Twitter. The pettiness displayed by the 34-year-old Bryant makes him appear more like a high school student who just got dumped than an NBA superstar. This access to off-the-court behavior is the kind of thing that we were not privy to before Twitter.
Social media has humanized celebrities to the point 
that, for the most part, we now know that they are re-ally just like us — only with more money and likely an inflated ego. They spell words incorrectly and get drunk. They watch Shark Week in their socks and sleep in beds, just like we do. I miss when the private lives of celebrities were private. Before the social media takeover, we were always left wanting more of our favorite celebrities. Now, I just want less.

The Onion, a satirical news network, produced a 
parody of TED Talks titled “Using Social Media To Cover For Lack Of Original Thought.” In the video, 
a young presenter wearing ﬂ  ashy clothes references a snapshot of Cheetos’ Facebook page. 
“Any teenager could have done what we did for no 
money — and much faster,” he says smugly, implying that his advertising team created the page. “...In the new social media economy, you just have to look like you’re doing work, and people will pay you for it.” 
The satire is a bit harsh, but it highlights a real issue: 
Some professionals see websites like Facebook as a cure-all because they’re trendy, cheap and easy to use. Now that UF has introduced an online master’s degree in “So-cial Media,” it has an opportunity to redeﬁ  ne the buzz phrase. 
First, what does “social” mean? For the purposes of a 
communications campaign, the word should apply to all media that inspires audiences to congregate, share ideas and take action. Film screenings and live performances are less sexy than Twitter, but they can be more engaging.
The Bridge Project, a fundraising campaign spon-
sored by Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, courted donors with personal events and movies. I edited a documentary and mailed DVDs to the prospects instead of using YouTube. Without Web-based tactics, the project raised several million dollars for cancer research.
A broad deﬁ  nition of social media may also include 
high-tech gadgets. Breakfast, a New York-based design agency, uses robotics to connect the virtual and physical worlds. To promote major gallery openings, the agency built iPad-controlled blimps that broadcast live video among crowds in different rooms. 
With so many exciting “social” tools at their disposal, 
how should communicators decide which to employ? Great campaigns tend to base the decision on audience research rather than technology trends. For example, the Bridge Project chose personal events because its audience was small and centralized in Boston.
To be fair, websites offer instant statistics that may be 
helpful to you, depending on your major. If you’re a jour-nalism student whose mission is to inform, “likes” and page views may prove you’ve suc-ceeded.
For public relations majors, 
the stats tell an incomplete story. A PR campaign must persuade audiences to act for a cause, whether it’s quitting cigarettes, getting an HIV/
AIDS test or buying stock in a company. Because “rais-ing awareness” is a taboo in the ﬁ  eld, students have to do extra research to prove “likes” and tweets translate into a measurable impact on people’s behavior.
Research-backed websites can be wonderful tools 
for mobilizing people. Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest developed www.wheredidyouwearit.com — an interactive map that lets users describe where they had sex and how it felt — to promote condom use. As of July 16, about 20 people had reported wearing condoms on or near the UF campus. 
Building a custom site is generally better than anchor-
ing a campaign around Facebook. You can always hire a nerd who knows how to program or simply use a content management system. As a programmer — OK, a nerd — I appreciate having greater control over a site’s design and behind-the-scenes code.
Facebook intentionally limits your reach to make you 
pay for greater exposure. While Reddit’s news-sorting algorithm is open to the public, Facebook’s code is pro-prietary, meaning it’s harder to predict how posts will be ranked. Plus, the last time I checked, Facebook doesn’t offer condom-shaped buttons — a must-have for every campaign.
Despite The Onion’s parody, I don’t think social me-
dia are inherently silly or useless, but “social media,” the phrase, is desperately lacking. Communicators should broaden it to include the dozens of exciting formats at their disposal, then let audience research dictate the me-dium.

On Friday night, several-hundred Gainesville 
residents braved the Florida summer heat to see 
Morningbell. Fresh off a two-week tour in promo-tion of its latest album “Bôa Noite,” the band per-formed on Bo Diddley Community Plaza for the Free Fridays series.
Nobody was still while the 
band played its first set com-piled of a mix of songs from its previous albums. A man with waist-length gray hair danced, rolling his hips and kicking his feet. A girl in a pink tutu twirled 
with her older sister. A group of mothers in sun-dresses donning back tattoos waved their arms above their heads, sloshing their drinks. 
Morningbell’s earlier sound is as eclectic as 
its fans, with musical influences ranging from the Beatles and ska influences to Radiohead and soul.  
Since its formation in 2000 by brothers Eric 
Atria, bass, and Travis Atria, lead vocals and gui-tar, Morningbell has produced six albums on its own nonprofit, independent local label, Orange Records of Gainesville. Current members include Stacie Atria on keyboard and Chris Hillman on drums. 
“Bôa Noite,” released in May, represents a no-
ticeable shift in the band’s sound. The Atria broth-ers said they turned to Claude Debussy and other classical musicians as inspiration for the composi-tion, resulting in an ethereal, orchestral sound.
There were many avant-garde classical mu-
sicians Travis Atria started listening to, he said, “and that’s the weirdest sh-t you can imagine. Makes Yoko Ono sound like the Bee Gees.”
In order to create a classical sound with multi-
ple instruments, Eric Atria said, they hired musi-cians all over Gainesville to record pieces of songs separately rather than rent an orchestra hall and hire a full orchestra.
“On the title track of the album, which is the 
most orchestrated, we had them each play a phrase,” Eric Atria said. “So it would be four bars of a part, and then I just cut and pasted it — so it would be four bars of chaos.”
Although Friday’s show was cut short by a 
sudden thunderstorm, Morningbell will be mak-ing appearances in Gainesville before getting back to the studio.
“We had a very successful tour, a very success-
ful press campaign, and now we’re just playing some home shows and taking it easy for a while,” Eric Atria said. “We just like playing music in Gainesville. It’s our home.”
Morningbell’s next show is Sept. 13 at Loosey’s, 
120 SW First Ave., at 10 p.m. In the meantime, the Atrias’ cover band, the Sh--ty Beatles, will play Saturday at Loosey’s, also at 10 p.m.
“Bôa Noite” is available on both morningbel-
lonline.com and iTunes.

Katherine Dunham debuted the 
theatrical performance “Southland” 
in 1951 in a theater in Chile. After the performance, she learned the U.S. Embassy had disapproved of its “anti-American” themes — or rather, anti-discriminatory under-tones — and banned the theater from performing the show in the U.S.  According to Cleo Parker Rob-inson, a student of Dunham’s, the dance company lost funding and folded soon after as a result of the racism-battling ballet.
In 2000, Dunham expressed at 
her 90th birthday that her only re-gret was not being able to show “Southland” in her own home country. With the help of one of Dunham’s former dancers, Julie Be-lafonte, Parker Robinson accepted the challenge to revive the once-banned ballet.
Because Parker Robinson is half 
black and has deep feelings about racism, she felt moved to do this piece, saying, “I think it’s my mis-sion to do it.”
However, with Dunham and 
most of her original dancers now deceased, and the sheet music with all the vocal and instrumental parts for the ballet lost, reconstructing “Southland” was no small feat.
“We had no money, no support, 
no nothing, except for a vision and hope from Katherine Dunham,’’ Parker Robinson said. 
Yet with financial help from 
the National Endowment for the Arts, the discovery of other, former Dunham dancers Ricardo Avalos and Theo Jamison, who had the sheet music, and the unearthing of the film “The Magic of Katherine Dunham” with original parts of the show in it, the ballet was beginning to come together.
However, there was emotional 
tension between the Cleo Parker Robinson dance company, and its white dancer Susan Richardson. Richardson feared taking the role of Julie, who accuses an innocent black field worker of raping her, because of how the audience may perceive her.
There was also the issue of re-
constructing the complex musical sheet under the one-week deadline. Parker Robinson recalls going to 10 different musical composers until musician Michael Williams agreed to do it.
Robinson hopes that the students 
will leave the performance realizing the mistakes of the past and will, in turn, work to change the future.

The essays, exams and read-
ings from Summer B’s “What is the Good Life?” have more than 1,000 UF freshmen groaning already, but Monday’s and Tuesday’s common activity,  required of the HUM 2305 students, is giving students a reason to smile. Cleo Parker Robinson’s dance ensemble has come to the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts and is not leaving unnoticed.
Since the HUM 2305 students 
will soon be reading “Letter From Birmingham Jail” by Martin Luther King Jr., they will be able to under-stand the weighty racial themes portrayed in “Southland.”
“We often try for the perfor-
mances to pick a theme that relates to the module,” said Andrew Wolp-ert, associate professor of classics and course coordinator for “What is the Good Life?”
“A performance is a cultural 
event, but it’s also a community event; it plays with your emotions and causes an emotional response. You can see how the artist is asking you to think about different ques-tions and engages with you, and we want to have students to recognize that,” Wolpert said.
Set in early 20th century Ameri-
ca, “Southland” depicts the story of a black field hand who is falsely ac-cused of raping a white woman. The ballet incorporates blues and gospel music, and terse, impassioned jerky movements to evoke a sympathetic response.
UF freshman and HUM 2305 
student Grant Aiossa responded to the piece saying, “’Southland” was very eye opening. It moved me to see how far we came from such ra-cial tension.”
Fellow freshman political science 
and public relations major Rachel Reiss said, “It was difficult to figure out the premise, but it was enjoy-able for entertainment purposes, and I appreciated the authenticity of the costumes and music.”Southland: a revival

Sarah Parmenter, 20, steps up to a panel of judges to 
strut her stuff at the GFW Model Casting Call.PATRICIA BUTLER
Avenue Writer
                                                  
If you’re the type who likes half-na-
ked models strutting their stuff down a runway, then keep your calendars open Saturday evening. Gainesville Fashion Week will host a poolside cocktail party with one of the hottest — literally and ﬁ  guratively —  swimwear runway shows of the summer. The action will be at The Enclave Apart-ments, 3000 SW 35th Place. The doors open at 6 p.m., and the show goes from 7-10 p.m. 
GFW has done swimwear fashion 
shows during the spring in the past, but this is the ﬁ  rst time they are doing a summer show, executive producer Albey Coronel said.
The show will have 22 models 
walking down the runway: 13 women and nine men. If you’ve been to GFW events before, you’ll be surprised by all the new faces you’ll see.
“About two-thirds of the models 
are new that we recently found in the casting call,” Coronel said. 
Jennifer Cowie, the marketing 
manager for The Collier Companies, said The Enclave is doing this event to promote  its name and show people how great it is to live in a luxury apart-ment.
“A partnership with GFW made 
sense because this is an elite fashion show,” Cowie said.  “We’re looking to get on the map with an event that will gain popularity in the community.”
This will be the ﬁ  rst time The En-
clave is hosting an event like this as well, and it is planning to continue do-ing bigger things in the community, Cowie said.
“The Enclave’s catchphrase is ‘De-
ﬁ  ning the Good Life,’ and doing the GFW show is showing that this really is the good life,” Cowie said.
Food and beverages will be served 
at this free event sponsored by www.ApartmentsInGainesville.com. Those who are 21 and older will have the op-tion to purchase alcoholic beverages at the bar, GFW intern Niko Pifferetti said.
Guests should wear casual-cocktail 
attire, but be sure to dress wisely be-cause it’s going to be hot! Because Flor-ida weather tends to give us whiplash, if it rains, the fun will still continue at The Enclave basketball courts which are fully covered.
“We’re super excited about the 
show,” Coronel said. “We have a lot of different things we are working on, and we are working with a great team and great people.”
“We’re looking to have a good 
time.”

� SHOP IS OPEN DAILY.
OLIVIA LANGDON

Wolfgang fashion clothing 
store off University Avenue 
has long forgone paper adver-tising after it saw little return for sales during the year of its establishment in 2007. The shop has decided to launch an online store due to increasing sales generated from strong social media marketing. Mat-thew Turner, store owner, said social media proves the “best way to get people in.”
Through constant Facebook 
photo updates, statuses an-nouncing new clothing ship-ments and 20 percent off offers available via Facebook check in, Wolfgang has joined top-selling retailers in brand ad-vocacy through social media marketing.
The Wall Street Journal on-
line recently featured a story on this emerging social media marketing technique, which has allowed retailers to build a more intimate relationship with its current and potential buyers.
Starting an original brand 
hashtag on Twitter and Insta-gram, these retailers are ask-ing the everyday consumer to upload his or her own photo wearing the company’s brand.
“It is the comment card ... 
brought to life in social me-dia,” said Bruce Floyd, UF’s social media specialist.
Since social media plat-forms began, people have been sharing their opinions about products.
“Those opinions can mani-
fest itself in words … in im-ages,” Floyd said. “Now the opportunity is apparent for a clothing company or a design-er.”
Customers take photos of 
themselves in the dressing room or wearing the brand’s clothes and tag the Wolfgang Facebook proﬁ  le in a status with the photo, which then appears in the clothing store’s tagged pictures.   
“It encourages people to be 
excited about something they get from here,” Turner said.
Rather than displaying 
models sporting a company’s apparel, social media is allow-ing people to post, hashtag and upload personal photos simply because they are happy with the retailer’s product. Ac-cording to Floyd, this allows all businesses “to essentially crowdsource content that they are not even asking for.”  
Retailers are saving money 
by utilizing social media as a method to advertise through the average person. Floyd said this technique spurs creativity allowing regular people who are “fashionistas” in their own sense to share with others how they put together an outﬁ  t. This would provide invaluable market research to the busi-ness as well.
Wolfgang wants to feature 
user-generated photos once the website establishes its pres-ence in the community.Improved social media

tumblr.com/askDear Mediocre Advice,
Is confidence knowing what you want 
and going for it without any regrets?
Dear Friend,
Make no mistake; regret is a feeling you need to address. Regret is trying to finger 
your partner’s b-hole and getting poop on yourself. Regret is how you learn lessons. 
There is only one feeling when you drink 20 beers and have explosive diarrhea the next morning. You’re not whispering, “no regrets” as you cling to the toilet; you’re whispering, “Jesus, take the wheel.” Not regretting something is like refusing to admit you were wrong. It makes you look careless and means you probably don’t have a lot of responsibilities in life. I can think of a lot of things that would require me to consume 
a bottle of tequila to wash away the stain of regret.

Dear Mediocre Advice,
You seem to know about what things you should do in 
bed, but what about the things you should definitely avoid?
Dear Friend,
Avoid 9/11 jokes, crying, pretending your dick is a windmill or 
tucking it in like Buffalo Bill, anything that would make your partner 
feel like a pedophile and asking, “Want to smell something weird?”
Dear Mediocre Advice,
Where do farts go when you hold them in?
Dear Friend,
When it is not socially acceptable to fart, you need to clench those butt 
cheeks. This may occur when you’re talking to your boss or running past someone you actually need to impress, like an in-law. Much like suppressing a sneeze, the fart you’re trying to terminate is just going to come back twice as loud. It slowly travels to limbo — a place between your ass and your belly 
button. Just when you think it somehow disappeared — like you have the power to make things inside of your body vanish — it comes back hard like a rollercoaster on steroids. If you’re surrounded by people, you should call out your own fart like calling island in a game of beer pong. If it’s intentional, then it’s not as embarrassing; just know that people are still going to laugh.Dear Mediocre Advice,
My new boyfriend is amazing in the sack. The only problem 
is he is a nightmare to actually sleep next to. He snores, hogs 
the blankets and even talks in his sleep. What’s a girl to do?
Dear Friend,
Cuddling, spooning and all that cute sh-t can’t always work out. It’s not actually 
comfortable to hold your partner all night because you’re going to wake up feel-ing like an amputee. If it is impossible to sleep next to your boyfriend, sleep apart. Sleep is valuable as an adult, and if your dick boyfriend is going to act like he’s at a party in bed just because he sleeps that way, head to the couch. When the morn-ing comes, return for morning sex, but trust me, not cuddling and sweating on each 
other all night won’t damage your relationship — it’ll probably save it.

� THE HIPP IS LOCATED AT 
25 SE SECOND PLACE.
SHANEECE DIXON
Avenue Writer
Despite the summer being 
more than halfway over, there 
is still plenty of time to catch some of the Hippodrome State Theatre’s best movies and stage productions during Summer B. As somewhat of a landmark in downtown Gainesville, the Hipp not only shows films but theater productions as well.
“Nancy, Please,” which pre-
miered Friday, focuses on the sto-ry of Paul Brawley, a young Ph.D. candidate at Yale University. He moved into an apartment with his girlfriend, Jen, and now he needs to complete his dissertation or risk withdrawal from the doctoral program. However, he left behind something of importance at his old home that stands in the way of finishing his dissertation.One thing becomes an obsta-
cle between Paul and this item, though: his ominous ex-room-mate, Nancy. 
“I thought ‘Nancy, Please’ was 
an excellent thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat, wonder-ing what would happen next,” wrote Alisha Kinman, the cinema director for the Hippodrome in an email. “‘Nancy’ is unusual to the selection of films that have been brought to the Hippodrome. Typically, thrillers have not been catered to. Exposing the works of young, new directors, writers and actors/actresses is very important to the Hippodrome.”
Following in the footsteps 
of many theatre companies, the Hipp offers its adaptation of the much-loved Broadway produc-tion, “Avenue Q.” 
Inspired by beloved children’s 
show “Sesame Street,” the pro-duction addresses various issues associated with the beginnings of adulthood. The characters remark on how their parents and shows like “Sesame Street” taught them that they are special and can do anything. Taking place in New York City, humans and pup-pet characters interact with one another as they embark on this adult-themed version of “Sesame Street,” covering issues such as racism, homosexuality and por-nography.
“I would expect to see some of 
the funny truths in our society,” said Joel Oramas, who plays Trek-kie Monster in the Hipp’s produc-tion of the play. “Things that peo-ple deem as offensive or taken as some sort of taboo — it’s okay to laugh at those things.”
“Avenue Q” shows will be 
playing the rest of this week and until July 28.
Directed by Jordan Vogt-Rob-
erts, “The Kings of Summer,” opening July 26, is another com-ing-of-age comedy about three teenage friends: Joe, Patrick and the unpredictable Biaggio, who seek to assert their independence and spend their summer build-ing a house in the woods to live far from their parents’ rules. Over time, their vacation becomes a true test of friendship as each boy learns to appreciate that family is something you can’t run away from.
Also open-
ing July 26 is the c o n t e m p o r a r y vampire thriller, “ B y z a n t i u m , ” directed by Neil Jordan (“Inter-
view with the Vampire,” “The Crying Game”). This film focuses on Eleanor and her guardian, Clara, as they attempt to assimi-late into human society and deal with the downsides of eternal life.
Clara meets Noel, the lonely 
owner of a deserted guesthouse, Byzantium. Meanwhile, Eleanor becomes close friends with Frank and tells him a dark secret be-tween her and Clara — they were born 200 years ago and travel the world, surviving on human blood. As the truth of their past spreads, it catches up to them with severe consequences.
As part of a 32-city movie tour, 
the Hippodrome will also have a one-night advance film screening of “American Made Movie” Aug. 4. Many of the world’s most suc-cessful companies have engaged in offshoring practices to stay competitive in the business mar-kets. This movie focuses on inno-vative companies that continue to thrive with American-made prod-ucts. 
The film shows the positive 
impact of domestic manufactur-ing jobs on national and local economies in the face of economic obstacles.

Mary Glazer would be a perfect choice for any 
aspiring writer to get advice from. Her work has 
already been published in several issues of Florida Gardening magazine. Now, she is the Gulf states regional writer for Lowe’s Creative Ideas online gardening magazine.
But if you ask her, she’s not a writer at all.“I don’t consider myself to be a writer because 
grammar and punctuation is something I struggle with and does not come naturally to me,” Glazer said. “I am more comfortable with a verbal pre-sentation, where I don’t have to consider where all the filler words fall or in what sequence.”
But the Writer’s Alliance of Gainesville thought 
differently. About 30 people sang and laughed as they listened to stories and tips based on Glazer’s experience as a published writer. The nonprofit or-ganization hosted its July seminar series, A Free-lance Writer’s Maiden Voyage, at the Millhopper branch library on Sunday.
The Writer’s Alliance of Gainesville is a non-
profit organization that promotes, encourages and supports aspiring and experienced regional writ-ers. Members can participate in monthly meet-ings, writing contests, ongoing critique groups, public readings and “collaborations with schools and civic organizations to foster creative expres-sion through the written word.”
Members also have the opportunity to have 
their work published in the Bacopa Literary Jour-nal, which is free for group members. Glazer, a former member of the alliance, is now a writer who is under contract for the first time in her ca-reer. With this new experience, she found skills that could also help other group members in their creative writing.
“It was the first time in my life someone gave 
me topics to write on,” said Glazer on her first time writing for Lowe’s. “That really took a lot of pres-sure off of me. Anytime I’ve written for Florida Gardening, I pitched articles, and to no surprise, many of my ideas were turned down.”
In her “Five Tips to Sail” presentation, Glazer 
talked about the importance of using outlines to start a piece and never starting a new chapter with a blank paper.
She said that in past experi-
ence, she was not used to some-one giving her deadlines for her work. She admits it was difficult to balance her work for Lowe’s while attending UF to pursue studies in ornamental horticul-
ture.
“My editor had asked me, ‘Can you write an ar-
ticle a week until I get you caught up with the oth-er nine writers in the country?’ and I said ‘Sure.’ Because what are you going to say when you have a full opportunity land in your lap? I have a huge stack of schoolwork from UF and I thought, ‘No. This ain’t going to happen.’”
But Glazer did make Lowe’s her top priority 
and said despite some mistakes she’s made, it al-ways helped her to have someone else look over her work. She encouraged attendees to get feed-back on their work from someone else.
Much of what Glazer said was very informative 
for several audience members, including potential alliance member Terri Regotti.
“I thought the meeting was great, and I really 
enjoyed listening to Mary,” said Regotti, who likes to write nonfiction pieces. “My takeaway was per-haps, in what I’m working on writing, I need to consider not naming real names.”
When Glazer is not writing gardening pieces for 
Lowe’s, she is working on a medical memoir but enjoys writing about plants, people and nature.

The new Kanye West al-
bum, “Yeezus,” is much like 
the rapper himself: controver-sial, unpredictable, egotistical, yet admittedly intriguing.
“Yeezus” is beyond much 
of the conventions that fill modern day hip-hop and even West’s prior albums. The lyr-ics and sounds are almost a ca-cophony — an appealing one, if at all possible. It’s a little less lyrically cohesive and meaty but a lot more minimalistic. Just take a look at the cover art alone.
It’s really all Kanye. Com-
pletely raw, at times uneasy to listen to, yet always adventur-ous. But of course, it wouldn’t be Kanye if there wasn’t any controversy.
West took some heat from 
the American Parkinson’s Dis-ease Association when the lyr-ics from one of the tracks on his new album, ”On Sight,” took on stigmas surrounding Parkinson’s disease, most no-tably through the lines “soon as I pull up and park the Benz/we get this b---- shaking like Parkinson’s.” The group deemed the lyrics “distaste-ful” and a “product of obvious ignorance.” Comments from the West camp regarding this ordeal have yet to materialize.
West’s new album has also 
inspired some religious stir-rings among critics who deem the title blasphemous as West continues the theme of religion and hip-hop that’s pervaded his career. Many though, like associate professor at Cali-fornia State University Long Beach Ebony A. Utley, Ph.D., don’t think the album is blas-phemous. In fact, she thinks the exact opposite:
“Oppressed people, in-
cluding many rappers, have a historical affinity for the Je-sus, who was misunderstood much like they are,” Utley said in her blog post regarding the album. Although a risky meta-phor, West juxtaposes himself with Jesus without any less re-spect for the figure he so obvi-ously reveres.
At the end of the day, West 
answers to no one but himself, which is exactly what “Ye-ezus” epitomizes. The album transcends the melodic “The College Dropout,” and the col-laborative power of “My Beau-tiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.” 
Love him or hate him, 
there’s something about this album — and even his previ-ous ones — that is just pure musical viscera.

� FLORIDA WAS CLEARED OF 
WRONGDOING. 
ADAM LICHTENSTEIN
Alligator Staff Writer
Before he stepped up to the podium as the 
first speaker at the annual Southeastern Con -
ference Media Days in Hoover, Ala., Florida 
coach Will Muschamp sparked controversy with something he said.
“In both situations we were turned in by 
Ohio,” Muschamp said about reported rules violations. “We appreciated our friends from Ohio making sure we’re compliant with NCAA rules. They certainly know a little bit 
about that subject.”
Former Florida coach and current Ohio 
State coach Urban Meyer reportedly turned in UF running backs coach Brian White for 
recruiting violations. Meyer has denied those allegations.
Florida was cleared of any wrongdoing in 
both incidents.
Muschamp’s comments were widely re -
ported before he made his opening statement in the main media room.
Muschamp began his 30-minute session 
with the media with a 15-minute opening statement, which touched on all aspects of the upcoming season.
Along with Muschamp, three Florida 
players 
-- quarterback Jeff Driskel, defensive 
end Dominique Easley and offensive guard 
Jon Halapio -- met with the media to answer 
questions that were both serious and light -
hearted.
“Rocky Top (is the most annoying SEC 
fight song),” Easley said. “Not because it’s 
Tennessee, but just because it’s Rocky Top.”
Purifoy at receiver, Burton everywhere: 
After trying him out at wide receiver during spring practice, Muschamp announced that 
defensive back Loucheiz Purifoy will see time with the offense when the season begins.
Muschamp said that Purifoy’s time on of -
fense will be determined based on how the 
receiving corps performs. Florida lost three of 
its four top pass-catchers and brought in five recruits at wideout.
“He probably won’t take any snaps on the 
first 12 to 14 practices because we need to find out what those other guys can do and how 
we’ve progressed from spring,” Muschamp 
said.
Purifoy is on the Bednarik Award watch 
list for his performance at cornerback. Last season, Purifoy had five pass breakups and forced three fumbles. He also racked up 13 
yards on one carry and one reception.
Senior Trey Burton, who specializes in 
Florida’s wildcat package, will see time all over the field, according to Muschamp.
“Trey Burton will play everything,” Mus -
champ said. “Wideout, running back, quarter -
back; he’ll have a huge part of our offense.”
Florida getting healthy: Doctors have 
cleared Florida linebacker Ronald Powell to practice with the team in the fall, Muschamp 
announced on Tuesday. 
Powell missed the 
entire 2012 season with an ACL tear he suffered in the 2012 
Orange and Blue Game. 
“(Powell’s) been through an awful lot,” 
Muschamp said. “Two surgeries. Never com-plained, never got down about anything.”
Powell, who was a five-star recruit accord -
ing to Rivals.com, led the team with six sacks 
his sophomore season. 
“(He’s) a guy I’m really excited to see get 
back on the field to see No. 7 running around 
in orange and blue,” Muschamp said.
Muschamp said the only two players who 
will be limited going into fall camp are offen -
sive lineman Trip Thurman and linebacker 
Alex Anzalone. Both players had shoulder surgery in the spring.
Kickoff times announced: Florida fans 
who dislike the heat will not enjoy the first two games on the Gators’ schedule.
Florida’s season opener against Toledo 
will begin at 12:21 p.m. and will be broad-casted on the SEC Network.
The following week, UF travels to South 
Florida to play Miami for the first time since 2008. That game will begin at noon.

When Jeff Driskel committed to Florida, he probably 
did not expect to make his first start at wide receiver.
But after a position battle with fellow 2011 class 
member Jacoby Brissett, Driskel lined up at wideout for 
the first play of the 2012 season.
He didn’t stay there for long, as he moved back to 
quarterback after the first play of the game. Following Florida’s 27-14 win against Bowling Green, Driskel was named the starting quarterback.
This year, the starting job is firmly in his grasp.“It’s his football team,” coach Will Muschamp said at 
Southeastern Conference Media Days in Hoover, Ala., on Tuesday.
Muschamp said he thinks Driskel improved drasti-
cally in the offseason and has grown as a player.
“(Driskel) certainly understands what we’re do-
ing offensively much better than a year ago,” he said. “(He’s) a guy I’m really excited to see play.”
Last year, Driskel’s offensive line had trouble pro-
tecting the first-year starter. He was sacked 36 times, including eight sacks in Florida’s game against Texas A&M on Sept. 8. 
“That’s one of the big things we’re working on this 
summer is pass protection,” redshirt senior guard Jon Halapio said.
Driskel said that leadership grew from spending 
more time with the team and growing older. He said he didn’t “want to step on anyone’s toes” as a first-year starter in 2012, but this year he’s ready to take the reigns.
“I’d say the guys respect me a lot more this year,” he 
said. “I’ve opened my mouth a lot more and just being around the guys, it just comes with it. You don’t flip a switch; it grows.”

Eight months after becoming the first 
freshman to win the Heisman Trophy, 
Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel stole the show on the second day of the Southeastern Conference Media Days in Hoover, Ala.
Manziel answered questions about leav-
ing the Manning Passing Academy and his upcoming sophomore campaign.
Despite reports that Manziel was kicked 
out because he was hungover and arrived late to camp on Saturday, the Heisman winner claimed the reason for his exit was benign.
“The rumors about the other things 
weren’t really true,” Manziel said. “I just overslept and missed a meeting … I’ve just been on a hectic schedule and overslept.”
Manziel stirred controversy earlier in 
the offseason after tweeting that he want-ed to leave College Station, Texas. He has since stopped tweeting.
“The whole social media aspect is dif-
ferent,” Aggies coach Kevin Sumlin said. “It’s a different time. It’s a different day and age.”
“I think that …  the discussion after the 
last tweet, you know, he 
hadn’t been on there ever since then. He hasn’t been on there for the last month. Obviously, there was something to that discussion.”
Added Manziel: “I 
used to be a person that 
watched ESPN and SportsCenter all day, every day. I shy away from it now, articles and things on Twitter.”
Regardless of the controversies, Man-
ziel said he improved in the offseason as he makes a bid to replicate his Heisman-winning numbers in 2013. 
“I’ve worked a lot to get better,” he 
said. “I’ve worked with the new guys, and that’s the biggest thing is making sure my teammates are prepared because we’re the ones who will take it to the next level.”
New coaches take stage: Four head 
coaches spoke at SEC Media Days for the first time on Wednesday.
Kentucky’s Mark Stoops, Tennessee’s 
Butch Jones, Auburn’s Gus Malzahn and Arkansas’ Bret Bielema all made their de-but.
Stoops, who was previously Florida 
State’s defensive coordinator, said the comments his brother – Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops – made about the SEC that questioned the conference’s strength were not necessarily accurate.
“I certainly understand Bob defending 
his conference,” Stoops said. “With that being said, I don’t think any of us need to defend what’s going on here in the SEC. The success we’ve had in the SEC speaks for itself.”

Manziel, A&M headline Day 2 in HooverAs part of the Alligator Awards rec-
ognizing the best in UF athletics during the 2012-13 season, col-
umnists Adam Lichtenstein and Landon Watnick will debate two of the five nomi-nees in each week’s category. Vote for the winner online at alligatorSports.org.
 
Adam: When the 2012-13 season be-gan, the ceiling couldn’t get much higher for the UF women’s tennis team. Back-to-back national titles left little room to improve.
But somehow, senior Lauren Em-
bree put up her most dominating sea-son.
For a couple of years, Embree was 
the Tonto to former No. 1 singles player Allie Will’s Lone Ranger, but Will left after the 2011-12 season. She finished her career with a 109-13 mark for her career and a 30-4 record in du-al-match, No. 1 singles.
The Gators needed Embree to step 
up, and she did.
In dual matches, Embree put up a 
20-1 record, dropping only one match despite playing against opponents’ top singles players.
Embree put on a show at Linder 
Stadium during each meet, and fin-ished the year as the top women’s player in the nation. On July 10, the ITA named her the top college player in the nation – a well-deserved honor. 
 
Landon: I’m not discrediting any-
thing Embree did last season — she’s my second choice for this Alligator Award — but I have to go with a freshman who achieved more in her respective sport than Embree did in 2012-13: Bridget Sloan.  
A member of the United States’ 
silver-winning gymnastics squad at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Sloan exceeded already-high expecta-tions in her first season at Florida.
As an all-around competitor, she 
led Florida gymnastics to its first na-tional title in school history one year removed from a heartbreaking defeat to Alabama in the Super Six. Sloan won the all-around and balance-beam titles that weekend, too.
At the end of the year, she was 
awarded the Honda Sports Award for gymnastics, which is given to the country’s top collegiate female athlete Who runs 
the world? These girls

in the sport.
  Before 2013, UF appeared in the 
Super Six 17 times — not once com-
ing home with a title. Sloan is the reason the Gators ﬁ  nally got over the hump.
Adam: Sloan had a great freshman 
year, but is she even the best gym-nast in Gainesville? Kytra Hunter put up a higher all-around average and holds two of UF’s best scores compared to Sloan’s top balance-beam total.
  The award is for best female ath-
lete, not best ﬁ  rst season. 
  Although Sloan was very im-
pressive, she had a great supporting cast to carry the Gators to their ﬁ  rst national title.
  Embree lost two of Florida’s best 
players from her squad — Will and Joanna Mather. Sure, Embree’s sup-porting cast put up good numbers, but any team that loses players like that is going to suffer.
  Embree had to square off against 
top opponents day in and day out. Sloan didn’t have to win all-around titles at every single meet, but Em-bree needed an A+ performance ev-ery time she competed.
  Sloan was like Chris Bosh or 
Dwyane Wade — a great player, but not LeBron, not the centerpiece. Embree was the straw that stirred the Gators drink.
  Oh, and did I mention she 
won two titles?
Landon: If you make any 
more Miami Heat compari-sons, I’ll have to send a re-quest to Matt Riva to waive you via the amnesty provi-sion, Mike Miller-style.
  Sloan guided her team to a 
championship this year and Em-bree didn’t. It basically comes down to that.
  If this category was “Greatest 
Legacy Left By a Female Athlete at Florida,” of course Embree would win it. We wouldn’t even need a Rally to debate it.
  But this Alligator Award focuses 
on the best female athlete in *2012-13*, and Sloan dominated her sport, even more so toward the latter half of the season. Sloan is UF’s most tal-ented gymnast. The Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh references at this point are prehistoric (cue rimshot), and I’m tired of hearing them.
  So what if Sloan didn’t achieve 
the highest all-around score on the team this year? For a six-meet stretch, including three NCAA meets, she did not score any lower than a 39.60. Her lowest all-around score all year was a 39.425. That’s consistency at its ﬁ  nest.
  Sure, Hunter battled a left 
ankle injury throughout the regular season and dealt with the stomach ﬂ  u during one meet, but she didn’t have an amazing NCAA Tournament in all-around competition. Sloan had a better postseason than both Hunter and No. 1 
Embree, who fell to Stanford’s No. 13 Nicole Gibbs in singles play in the NCAA semiﬁ  nals. 
Adam: That’s the second time 
you’ve said “(cue rimshot)” in the paper this summer. Cue the hook to pull you off stage.
  Embree struggled in the postsea-
son after carrying the team to the semiﬁ  nals. The ﬁ  rst time she lost in the dual-match season was her ﬁ  nal match of the year.  Embree is obviously one of the 
best female athletes in Florida’s his-tory — scratch that, she’s one of the best athletes of any gender from UF, period. 
  Although her ﬁ  nal year ended on 
a sour note, she still had an incred-ible season. She still dominated her sport more than any other Gators athlete.
  And I’d like to see you try to get 
me released, rookie. I’m the Pat Ri-ley of this whole operation.
  Landon: Rookie? I’ve been on 
this paper for four semesters now.
  But my argument is there for ev-
erybody to read. I rest my case.
