CLEVELAND, Ga. (AP) — A north Geor -
gia man said he and his wife found a neigh-
bor’s buffalo in their swimming pool. 
Chris Nonnemaker said he and his wife 
noticed two holes in the pool’s cover and went outside to take a look Saturday morning in White County.
 Nonnemaker said they noticed something 
moving. 
When he pulled the pool cover back, Non-
nemaker saw a buffalo that had escaped from a neighbor’s home.
Nonnemaker called police and videotaped 
the animal’s rescue, which involved ropes to help coax the buffalo out near the shallow end.
Deputies said the buffalo belonged to a 
neighbor and escaped with two others weeks ago. They said those two were caught shortly after they got away.
The owners of the buffalo that was in the 
pool decided to put the animal down.

The Florida-Georgia game is one of 
the biggest parties of the year, and to en-
sure safety, Jacksonville Fire and Rescue personnel will staff UF’s student safety 
areas. 
During the game or at the after party, 
chaos can ensue as students guzzle co-pious amounts of alcohol, embracing 
the tradition of the event known as The World’s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Par -
ty.
To help them navigate the weekend 
safely, UF will have Sideline Student 
Safety Zones, where students of both universities can get access to taxis, cell 
phone chargers, computers, first aid and 
maps of the area, a press release said.
In addition, there will be free snacks, 
water and coffee at the stations. 
During the past four years, the safety 
zones were staffed by UF volunteers, 
but this year the stations will be staffed 
by the City of Jacksonville. Medical ser -vices will be provided by the city’s Fire and Rescue Department, UF spokesman 
Steve Orlando said. 
The only university personnel will 
be six consultants who have previously been volunteers for the event.
“It provides a safe place for students 
to go to and get any kind of help that they need,” said Maureen Miller, a spe-cialist with UF’s GatorWell Health Ser -
vices. “It’s a place where students can kind of regroup, and we’re gonna be there to help them, reassure them and 
see what their needs are.”
Students who seek treatment at the 
safety zones will not face consequences for alcohol-related incidents.

Florida will receive an additional $800 million 
to build a high-speed rail line to link Orlando to 
Tampa, Sen. Bill Nelson’s office announced on Monday. 
The extra money will be given in addition to 
the $1.25 billion Florida received from the Ameri-
can Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, otherwise known as 
the stimulus bill.
In a press release, Nelson said 
the railway could be as big of a boost to Florida’s economy as Disney was.
Ruth Steiner, a UF assistance professor of ur -
ban and regional planning, said plans for the rail-way have been in the works since the 1990s, but 
former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush put the plan on

CRIME
Gainesville Police arrested a man and woman who’d been 
running a marijuana operation out of a rented apartment in the 
Jefferson 2nd Avenue complex.
Joseph Villanueva, 19, was arrested by police as he was 
entering the apartment on Thursday . Police had a warrant to 
search the residence, as well as a black suitcase Villanueva was 
carrying at the time, according to the police report.
Police found three and a half pounds of 
marijuana inside the suitcase and an ad-ditional three and a half pounds inside the apartment. The only other items inside were a vacuum sealer, scales and a large safe for storing marijuana, the report stated.
Ariana Hazel, 20, is the sole lessee of the 
apartment and admitted post-Miranda that the apartment was rented for the sole pur -
pose of keeping and distributing the drugs, 
the report stated.
Both are charged with possession with the intent to sell can-
nabis within 1,000 feet of a church, a felony, and maintaining a drug dwelling.

Gainesville Police caught a 
man late Monday night who had 
escaped while being transported to the Alachua County Jail early 
Sunday morning. 
According to a GPD release, 
after giving officers multiple 
fake names and birth dates to 
conceal arrest warrants from In-
dian River for dealing in stolen property and grand theft, the man was identified as Robert Franklin Ellis, 34.
Ellis was arrested at about 2 a.m., but while he was being transported to the jail, he kicked 
out the patrol car window. 
He then situated his hand-
cuffed hands to the front of his 
body, and despite being tased 
and told not to move by officers, 
Ellis dove out 
of the vehicle 
near the 1600 block of Eighth 
Avenue.

Alexander Kaufman and Weedley Funeus  
were hungry for brains.
The former Murphree Area resident assis-
tants decided to make a zombie movie while 
they were thinking of events for dorm resi-
dents last October.
“The movie ended up being really corny,” 
Funeus said. 
“It was really random and stupid, but we 
decided to go with it,” Kaufman said. 
“Residents Evil” is a 35-minute horror-
comedy film, which will premiere at Murphree 
Commons at 8 p.m. Wednesday.
Kaufman said he first thought he would 
just show the movie to the people who were in it, but then the Inter-Residence Hall Associa-
tion got involved and helped him rent out the 
equipment for the premiere. 
Kaufman rented out 100 chairs, a popcorn 
machine and a projection screen for the view-ing. 
Kaufman and Funeus wrote the 13-page 
script in just a few weeks in September 2009 and began to film in October 2009.
Kaufman said the movie cost about $20 to 
make. He said a former telecommunications stu-
dent lent out the camera equipment to them and other students helped with the makeup for the film.
“Without me it would have never started, 
and without other people it would have never happened,” Kaufman said. 
As an engineering major, Kaufman was not 
aware of the realities of filming a movie. 
He said editing was the most time consum-
ing, but making the movie was a great learning experience.
He decided to finish the movie on his own, 
bought a camera on eBay and began editing. 
Funeus said he initially wanted to do a re-
enactment of “Thriller,” but Kaufman did not agree. 
“It’s going to be embarrassing to watch but 
funny at the same time,” Funeus said. “Some-how Alex kept talking me into doing the most ridiculous things.”Students film horror comedy

The Florida Gators and the 
Georgia Bulldogs are facing off 
on the dance floor as well as the football field this year.
Lauren Klein, a member of UF’s Dazzlers dance team, is run-ning against Erica Smith of the University of Georgia in round 
four of the Athlon Sports Sideline 
Spirit Contest, which recognizes the most spirited college or uni-versity.
Students can vote online for their school’s representative in six rounds. 
Voting for the fourth round of 
the contest started on Oct. 21 and will run until Nov. 1. 
Students can register for free 
on the Athlon Sports website and 
vote up to 10 times per day.
“I think that no matter how 
our football team is doing, our 
school obviously has a lot of spir -
it, and it makes us stand out,” 
Klein said. 
Every year, Athlon Sports con-
tacts different universities and 
asks for a nominee from their 
cheerleading and dancing pro-
grams. 
It’s never guaranteed that 
Athlon Sports will take a nomi-nation, and this is the first time 
that UF has been chosen to partic-
ipate in the contest in four years, said Dazzlers coordinator Lauren Brady. 
“The girls work really hard, 
and it’s awesome that the public gets to see that,” Brady said.  “We have really well-rounded girls, so this is a good opportunity to 
show the community what we do 
besides just dance.”
The first bracket of the com-
petition is made up of six differ -
ent rounds with two winners for each. 
The winners will advance to 
the finals where they will sub-mit a promotional video of their team.
“It’s not just me that would be 
winning — it would be our entire 
spirit program,” Klein said.
According to the Athlon 
Sport’s Sideline Spirit Facebook 
page, the final winner will receive 
$2,000 in cash, a camera, a video 
camera and a TV .

Muggers, hijackers and attackers beware. 
UF students and faculty are practicing self-defense at Hil-
lel.
Every Tuesday at 7 p.m. Hillel, UF’s Jewish student center, 
offers free Krav Maga classes for anyone who wants to prac-
tice disarming an attacker, kicking an opponent, learning the 
proper way to escape a choke hold and much more.
Krav Maga, which is used by the Israeli Defense forces, 
translates to “contact combat” in Hebrew. It is an aggressive training system for everyday situations and is meant to height-en awareness of a dangerous circumstance, said Amanda Solo-mon, an anthropology junior who teaches the classes. 
“I’ve always been an aggressive person,” Solomon said. “I 
used to be an angry bitch before Krav Maga.”
The students wear sneakers and regular workout clothes 
because the purpose of the training is to provide them with the practice needed to confront an attacker and comfortably use fighting techniques learned in class.
“The main idea I promote is to go home safe,” 
Solomon said. “We’re not always surrounded by the best of people.”
She said Krav Maga was created in the 1940s 
in Slovakia to help protect Jewish villagers from 
Nazi brutality. The self-defense system was then brought to Is-rael after the state’s creation. 
Marisa Gottesman, Jewish Student Union communication 
vice president, said that these classes open up students to Is-raeli culture and give them a connection to it. 
“This gives students a taste of what they do over there,” she 
said.
Alex Mena, a political science sophomore and member of 
Army ROTC, had been training in Krav Maga for two years 
prior to attending a class at UF Hillel. 
“I thought the class was great,” he said. “It’s like the real 
training I used to do at my home studio.” 
Mena said that Krav Maga could be helpful for students liv-
ing in a college town because it teaches them how to control 
situations and protect themselves. 
Marketing sophomore Benjamin Brasch said that his first 
class with Solomon convinced him to attend classes for the rest of the year.
“Amanda is just so passionate about it,” he said. “She lives 
it.”
He said the consistent classes provide reinforcement for ef-
fectiveness and allow people to grow. Hillel offers class

The UF chapter of the Public Relations 
Student Society of America recently won an 
opportunity to host the 2011 National Con-
ference in Orlando. 
The PRSSA national committee and other 
decision makers announced the results last 
week during the 2010 conference in Wash-
ington, D.C.
This will be the first time UF has hosted 
the conference since 2005. 
Nick Lucido, the PRSSA National Com-
mittee president, said a letter of intent was sent to chapters in the southeast in the spring to see who was interested in formu-lating a bid.
The UF Alpha Chapter was the first to 
present a bid.
Three members presented the bid to 15 
judges, which included the three 2010 con-ference coordinators.
Lucido said the UF team was memorable 
because of their professionalism and how they walked into the room.
“I think overall I was really impressed 
that they brought new and fresh ideas to the 
table,” he said.
Monica Vigo, UF PRSSA vice president of 
chapter development, decided to enter a bid in the spring. While she did not make the 
trip to Washington, D.C., she coordinated bid efforts by forming a committee, acting as a liaison among the UF adviser, PRSSA na-
tional committee and the UF bid committee.
She said at points it was stressful and 
time management was necessary, but the 16 
members who worked on the bid made the final product possible.
“We all committed to this and can’t let it 
fall,” Vigo said.UF PR club wins 2011 bid
� THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE IS

A mother and her two children es-
caped a fire that destroyed their home 
in the Arbor Park Apartments complex Sunday . 
Flames broke out in the apartment on 
Southwest 16th Avenue early Sunday morning. Gainesville Fire Rescue received a 911 phone call at 2:53 a.m. and arrived by 2:59 a.m. to extinguish the flames.
The occupants, a mother and her two 
children, awoke to a smoke-filled bed-room and evacuated safely . 
“We don’t know if their smoke detec-tor was working,” said District Chief Jeff Lane. “They were very fortunate.”
The flames were controlled in 10 min-
utes, and the fire was completely extin-guished in half an hour. In total, more than a dozen occupants were evacuated from the complex, but most returned to their homes by 5 a.m. Fire rescue was un-able to save the burned apartment, and 
damage costs are estimated to be more 
than $150,000.
“The occupants were lucky to have an 
early warning and a rear stairwell,” Lane said. “They would not have been able to exit the front door; it was consumed by fire.”
The cause of the fire is unknown, but 
Lane stated it may have begun in the 
kitchen. Foul play has been ruled out of 
the investigation.Fire causes $150,000 in

Students came out to jam Mon-
day night as they supported lo-
cal artists and musicians at the 
UF Singer-Songwriter Society’s Open Mic Night at the Orange & Brew. Participants sang, played keyboard and guitar and kept the 
audience hooked with their poetic 
verses. 
Although various members 
of the Singer-Songwriter Society 
performed, the event was open for 
anyone to participate. Some sung inspirational songs, while oth-ers performed their own original work. One performer sang a med-
ley of songs, accompanied by his 
guitar. 
“With a good song, you’re tell-
ing a story,” said Preston Ashby, 
treasurer of SSS and a UF journal-
ism senior. “There’s kind of an air in the room when you do it right.”
Alton Edmond, a member of 
the audience, said he came to sup-
port others who were performing  
and found the event to be quite welcoming.“I really enjoyed the event,” Ed-
mond said. “It set a really smooth, relaxing environment. It was easy to get into the performances on stage because of the environ-
ment.”
The organization is hosting 
one more Open Mic Night event 
this semester but also hosts other activities to further help its mem-
bers, such as workshops for vocal 
training and stage presence. 
The group has also collaborated 
with other UF organizations, such as Hope for Haiti, that need per -
formers for their events.
The group has planned a ‘90s 
Night, which will take place Nov. 16 at Orange & Brew. SSS mem-bers will perform covers of songs 
from the 1990s. 
The organization, founded in 
March of 2009, was created to help 
promote local singers, songwriters and musicians. 
“There wasn’t a home for peo-
ple to get positive feedback,” said Malika Wright, founder and presi-dent of SSS. “Anyone passionate 
about music should join SSS be-
cause they will grow as artists.”UF singers, songwriters and artists step up to the micBy SHANNON DOBEL

With a just a swab of your cheek, you 
could help save a life.
On Tuesday and Wednesday from 11 
a.m. to 4 p.m., the Bone Marrow Donor 
Drive will be held at three different locations across campus. 
Students can register to join the national 
bone marrow database at any of the tables on the Plaza of the Americas, the North Lawn or Turlington Plaza, said Christie Atchison, co-coordinator of the event.  
Students must give a cheek swab and sign 
a consent form to register. They must also be in good health and over the age of 18. Cheek swabs will be sent to the Gift of 
Life Bone Marrow Foundation to be ana-lyzed, placed in the database and matched with transplant recipients in need of bone marrow.
Gift of Life is an associate donor registry 
of the National Bone Marrow Donor Pro-gram and a participating member of the worldwide registry Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide, according to the organization’s website.
It is also the first registry to ever use 
cheek swabs to test donors on a large scale at recruitment drives, according to the web-site. Gift of Life is funded and directed by an actual transplant recipient.
UF Hillel and Shands Footprints are the local organizers of the event.  Footprints is a support system for children in the oncology, transplant and immunology units of Shands at UF.  Many of these children are currently awaiting a bone marrow transplant, Atchi-son said.
Atchison and Erica Sokol both volunteer 
for Footprints and came up with the idea to host a donor drive on campus.
“Erica and I decided 
this would be a good way for Footprints to really do something that could di-
rectly affect our buddies,” Atchison said.
Jeff Kaplan, the program director at Hil-
lel,  helped with the planning and resources for the event.
“Registering is simple and donating is an 
in-and-out procedure that will directly save someone’s life,” Atchison said. 
This is the first event of its kind that the 
coordinators hope to put on annually from here on out.
There will also be a small raffle aimed at 
raising funds for Footprints.  Funds will go toward gift baskets and transportation for families of patients who do not live close to Shands, Atchison said.  Tickets will be sold for $1.
Atchison and Sokol are planning to have 
about 80 volunteers at the drive, and their goal is to register 1,300 people as donors.
Shayna Brant, UF student, said she is 
planning to participate in the donor drive.  
“To think I could play such a big part in 
saving someone’s life is amazing,” Brant said. “I don’t see a reason not to take five minutes out of my day to register.”

SHANDS CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL AND DANCE MARATHON.

Alligator Staff Writer
The construction of a solar-powered 
house and an update of the activities and supplies in the pediatric waiting area of Shands Children’s Hospital are just some UF ideas vying for $15,000 through the Pepsi Refresh Project.
The ideas competing to receive funding 
are determined by an online vote on the Gator 1 Central website.
Ten ideas are in contention in two cat-
egories, with five competing for $15,000 and the others for $5,000.
Dance Marathon, the organization that 
organizes the annual spring event, is in the running for the larger grant, which it plans 
to use to update the pediatric waiting cen-
ter at the Shands Children’s Hospital. 
According to a statement by the organi-
zation’s chairman, Kenny Brighton on the 
project’s website, the grant money would be used to buy supplies needed for volun-teers to host activities and crafts for chil-dren waiting for surgery.
The update would also include a flat-
screen TV and family-friendly DVDs.
The Wildlife Graduate Student Associa -
tion is one of the organizations seeking the smaller grant. The group wants to develop a recycling challenge program for local middle and high schools, with funds go-ing toward buying recycling bins, promot-ing the challenge and creating an incentive program.
Voting ends on Nov. 23. For more infor -

‘Intactivists’ signal the demise of America
Florida’s capital might be technically set among the 
foul-smelling hills and dales of Tallahassee, but Mi-
ami is the real epicenter for the patented brand of 
flagrant weirdness that marks our state as a global desti-
nation for charlatans and miscreants of every stripe.
Hammering home that point, just last month Miami 
also became the worldwide focal point of the intactivist movement.
Intactivists believe, quite deeply, that cutting off the 
foreskin of newborn male babies is barbaric and unneces-sary, and their movement thrives in the prickly wilderness 
that is the World Wide Web.
Gathering strength from their existence at the vital 
crossroads of the Internet, where conspiracy theories and the discussion and display of genitalia fortuitously meet, 
intactivists were outraged by the news in mid-September that a baby born at the Baptist Hospital of Miami had his 
little soldier snipped against the wishes of his parents.
Naturally, the mom hired a Jewish lawyer and is suing 
the hospital for $1 million.
A protest in Miami only managed to draw a handful 
of intactivists away from the comfort of their computer 
chairs, but a second planned protest hopes to have far 
more success as the case works its way through the legal 
system.
It’s my hope this next protest is a rousing success and 
the vocal leaders of the intactivist movement are all drawn to Miami, where a large net can be thrown on top of them and they can all be safely transported to Europe or New 
Zealand.
You see, getting rid of the foreskin is what propelled 
America to greatness in the 20th century. The greatest generation defeated the Nazis in north Africa while simul-
taneously fighting the krauts and their own oily, stinky foreskins. Most estimates put the number of American GIs undermined by an inability to prop-erly clean their wrinkly members at 
about 145,000.
After the war, American doc-
tors universally recommended the circumcision of male babies.  De-
cades of success followed, resulting in things like cable television, boy 
bands and flash-frozen vegetables.
Unburdened by foreskins, Amer -
ica vaulted to the top of the world economic structure. 
As foreskins have proliferated in recent decades,  
America has fallen from greatness.
Battered by intactivists and economic woes, many states 
have decided it best to stop paying for babies to have their 
foreskins removed. Sixteen states do not cover neonatal circumcision under Medicaid, Florida being among the 
uncovered minority.  
Here in Florida, we ask parents to pay between $250 
and $500 out of pocket to have their sons snipped right af-ter birth. Many refuse, knowing Medicaid will pick up the 
tab after three months when the child must be put under anesthesia and taxpayers end up paying more than $5,000 
to cover what is now a serious surgical procedure. 
At hospitals that still accept Medicaid, there is a year -
long waiting list for taxpayer-sponsored circumcisions.
Floridians are used to putting up with a certain level 
of craziness, but we cannot accommodate the intactivist 
wackos with their posters of crying babies and general ac-
ceptance of mediocrity.
By succumbing to interest groups and waffling as we 
are trained to do, America has created a much more ex-pensive way to skin a cat.
Tommy Maple is an international communications graduate 
student. His column appears every Tuesday.It’s slim pickings for Floridians electing the person to replace 
Gov. Charlie Crist as he heads into near-certain  obscurity.
Floridians have the choice between a somewhat lackluster 
chief financial officer and a Mr. Clean imposter who holds the 
dubious legacy of involving himself and his company in the largest Medicare fraud case in U.S. history.
It’s a tough one this time, Gators. 
We don’t have any political stars like Jeb Bush this time 
around. The closest thing we have to a catchy slogan is Rick 
Scott’s imploring of voters to get to work. 
But the fact of the matter is, regardless of their personalities, 
there is one clear choice for Florida’s next leader: Alex Sink.
After buying the defeat of Attorney General Bill McCollum, 
Scott’s campaign is largely based on his personal fortune, which grew when Columbia/HCA Healthcare paid him $9.88 million to stop stinking up the company . He’s spent a good chunk of his millions slinging mud in the eyes of opponents who simply can’t compete with his checkbook. 
We hope Floridians will see through it.
Scott has never held public office, yet he insists he can run 
the fourth most populous state just like he led his business. But 
if that’s true, we’ll owe billions of dollars after he lies, pleads the Fifth more than 70 times and claims he had no knowledge of wrongdoing.
Sink, on the other hand, has served as chief financial officer 
to a state where she regularly oversees a $200 million budget. 
We understand voter anger with the current administra-
tion’s seemingly lackadaisical efforts to pull us out of the eight-year gaping hole the former administration dug us into, but 
electing Scott is not just foolish. It’s laying down in the hole and 
asking officials to pile on the dirt.
There is no on-the-job training for the leader of one of the 
biggest states in the union. We can’t expect a millionaire buying 
his way to Tallahassee to know how to run an entire state by osmosis, particularly a millionaire who couldn’t ethically run a business. 
Sink is adding endorsement after endorsement to her list.  
Scott’s campaign is in such need of official support it has begun to advertise its own “Endorse Rick” option as private citizens endorse him rather than major newspapers.
Scott cancels many public debates, including one at UF origi-
nally scheduled for tonight, and seems generally afraid to con-front his opponents in any medium aside from sound bites and vicious ads. 
Furthermore, Scott’s views on everything from his 7-7-7 job 
creation idea, which one could say has no basis in fact and is simply an idea, to his views on valuing the rights of fetuses over gay Floridians are especially problematic. 
If anything, Floridians should be ashamed Scott has made it 
this far. In fact, the rest of America should be terrified. If Scott can make it to the general election, taking down one of Florida’s strongest Republican figures in the process, Scott has the po-tential to climb the political ladder and lend his inability to lead ethically and efficiently to the rest of the indifferent nation.
On the other hand, you have Sink — a pro-choice, pro-equal-
ity, pro-people candidate with the experience necessary to run a state.
We think the choice is clear. But if you’re still not convinced, 
just remember: a vote for Scott is a vote against someone who 
would do everything in his power to take away the rights of 
women, immigrants and anyone who doesn’t conform to his 
idea of “family values.” Is that really how you want to vote?Sinking Scott

Letters to the Editor
As the Nov. 2 elections draw near, tension across 
campus practically hangs in the air like UF’s humid-ity . For the United States, this upcoming election is 
more than just big — it’s life-changing.
The presidential election of 2008 also proved to be life-
changing, but was it for the best? Well, that’s something you’re going to have to decide for yourself. 
The November election has the potential to completely 
shift the political atmosphere from a  liberally democratic world of high taxes, big government, controlled health care and pro-choice sentiments to a more conservative demeanor with lower taxes, less government spending, less government 
regulation and pro-life notions. 
Many say this upcoming election will be a complete party 
re-alignment for our country with President Barack Obama’s 
liberal administration being voted out of Congress and new 
conservative Americans being voted in. 
This could be the change Americans have been waiting for. 
That’s not to say the election will be a complete victory for Re-
publicans, but based on noticeably lower approval ratings for Obama and his administration, it’s clear Americans are ready 
for a real change.
Conservatives find hope in Marco 
Rubio, the top Republican candidate for Florida’s U.S. Senate seat. Rubio offers 
a breath of much-needed fresh air as 
an ardent advocate of lower taxes, better schools, a leaner and 
more efficient government and free market empowerment.  
What many students don’t realize is that the political decision-making process greatly impacts them and their future families. 
It may not seem important to an 18-year-old college student 
that the current unemployment rate is 10 percent.  However, when that student graduates and has to start looking for a job, he or she will have to deal with whatever shape the economy is 
in and whatever current legislation has been passed into law.
The moral of the story is whomever we elect are the people 
making crucial decisions that will help the economy or harm 
it, drive the national debt up or help reduce it, and make this country as strong as it can be or continue to weaken it. It is 
up to us as voters to determine our country’s fate. This time, 
Americans, vote for who is right for our country. Vote for a change. 
Stephanie Strasser, UF studentReader supports Adam Putnam
In the race for commissioner of agricul-
ture and consumer services, Adam Putnam 
stands high above the rest.
Putnam is a Gator and holds a degree 
in food and resource economics from UF’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. 
As a student, Putnam continually proved 
himself to be a strong leader through his involvement in the Student Senate, the Florida Cicerones and Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity.
After graduation, voters elected Putnam 
to state House at the age of only 22 and served for four years before running for Congress in 2000. He has proudly and pro-fessionally represented Florida’s 12th Con-
gressional District for the past 10 years.
Putnam is currently running for com-
missioner of agriculture and consumer ser -
vices, a position perfectly suited for him as 
he is a fifth-generation Floridian born into 
a Polk County citrus and cattle ranching family. His common-sense, real-life approach to 
agriculture is exactly what our state needs in this time of economic trouble. 
Last year alone, agriculture contributed 
more than $1 billion to the state’s econo-
my. 
We need Putnam’s leadership and in-
novation to move our state’s economy and commodities forward.  
I encourage you to vote for Adam Put-
nam in the coming week whether by absen-
tee ballot, at one of the early voting loca-
tions or by voting in person a week from today. For more information about Putnam, please visit www.AdamPutnam.com or join Gators for Adam Putnam on Facebook.

Reader supports Marco Rubio
I respect The Independent Florida Alli-
gator for its endorsement of Kendrick Meek for U.S. Senate, but Marco Rubio is the best 
choice to represent Florida.
Rubio, a Gator graduate, is an experi-
enced public servant whose message of fis-
cal conservatism, smaller government and 
providing an ideological balance to the fed-eral government resonates with the major -
ity of Floridians.
His superb performance in the gauntlet 
of gubernatorial debates also proves Ru-bio’s intellectual grasp of the issues and statesman-like character any great U.S. Senator must 
possess.Rubio is the right choice for Florida, and 
I encourage you to join me in voting Marco Rubio to represent the great state of Florida in the U.S. Senate.

Block tuition a good idea for students
I really like the idea of block tuition. While I  appreciate Matthew Christ’s view-point, I think he’s looking at block tuition all wrong. 
Think about it: a flat rate for being en-
rolled at the university regardless of the number of classes you take. Whether you take 12 or 18 credits, you’ll pay the same price. 
That would make it so easy to plan to 
pay for college. 
And as for the topic of classes, as an en-
gineering student, I would have loved to 
have the time to take a sports class or an 
art class, but just paying for my core classes made that impossible. 
With block tuition, I could have added 
those classes basically for free. And for 
people who are overachievers, there is 
the added benefit of getting to pay less for graduating sooner. 
No matter how I look at it, it sounds like 
a good deal to me.

 Students crowded the Plaza of 
the Americas for a taste of culture at 
the Asian Food Festival on Monday.  Students who served samples  
behind tables with ﬂ  owers and cul-tural artifacts wore traditional garb, including Chinese silk cheongsam dresses, Thai dresses and colored, translucent Filipino barong blouses.  Each cultural organization had 
its own ethnic variation of rice noo-dle dishes, barbecues, chicken and desserts. 
    Anthony Espino, a UF junior, 
said the festival shows those who are not of Asian descent the differ-ent facets of Asian culture.
  “Spices and styles of cooking 
food vary among Asian cultures,” he said. “It’s such a diverse conti-nent, and spreading awareness of new and different cultures is a beau-tiful thing.”
    About 800 food tasters were giv-
en three red tickets to redeem at the organization’s table of their choice. One white ticket was given so tast-ers could vote on who should win best overall favorite dish.
  This is the ﬁ  rst year the festival 
was held on the Plaza of the Ameri-cas.
  “We usually have it in a venue 
outside of campus,” said Karen Vin-luan, the co-director of the festival. “It’s more open and convenient in the plaza. The entire campus can experience different cultures of Asia through food.”
  Phuong Nguyen, a UF biology 
major, showed up 45 minutes before 
food was served in order to beat the 
crowd and get a sneak peak at the menu.
  “I really don’t know a lot of the 
stuff on the menu,” she said, “but I usually eat Subway every day . This is a huge step up from what I usu-ally eat.”
  Each participating organization 
offered about three different types of ethnic food to sample. This is the ﬁ  rst year they were required to have their food catered by local restau-rants.
  All the organizations ran out of 
food within an hour. 
  The Asian Food Festival is one of 
the events organized for Asian Ka-leidoscope Month, a monthlong cel-ebration of Asian-American culture. 8, ALLIGATOR  TUESDAY, OCTOBER 26, 2010

 THEY PAY 75 CENTS TO RIDE THE BUS, BUT UF 
STUDENTS RIDE FREE.

 The Student Government at Santa Fe College is hosting 
a kickoff event Tuesday to promote its campaign for better 
bus access for students.
  The Start the Bus! Rally will be held in the Oak Grove at 
SFC’s Northwest Campus from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. There will 
be free food, a DJ and T-shirts. 
  Start the Bus!, an initiative that began about four or ﬁ  ve 
years ago, is a student-run campaign to lobby in Tallahassee 
for state community colleges to have the right to collect a transportation fee from students. 
The fee will be a little less than $3 per stu-
dent per credit hour, and the students could 
have the same bus access as students at state universities. 
  People who go to state universities show their IDs and 
get on the bus for free, while students attending state col-leges pay 75 cents  for bus fare.
Samuel A. Morris Jr., press secretary for SFC’s Student 
Government,   said this is the ﬁ  rst campuswide event the stu-dents have hosted this year, but they hope it will serve as a model for other state colleges to follow. Santa Fe students 
ask for bus access
College Republicans oppose 
additional stimulus spending
  The announcement came a 
week and a day before the mid-
term elections.
  Michael Martinez, chairman 
of the department of political sci-ence, said that while Nelson, a 
Democrat, isn’t up for election, 
sometimes Congress makes major announcements before elections in 
order to have an impact on voters.
  “It’s probably not entirely coin-
cidental,” he said.
  Ryan Garcia, second vice chair-
man of the UF College Republi-
cans, said he thinks that this an-
nouncement is meant to gain more 
Democratic votes.
  “Without a doubt,” he said.
  Kristin Klein, president of Col-
lege Democrats, said that the an-nouncement is probably separate 
from the election; if anything, it 
will show that Democrats support 
creating jobs, which she said this 
railway would do.
  Garcia said the College Repub-
licans are ofﬁ  cially against any 
additional government spending, especially anything that has to do 
with the stimulus bill.
  He said the government 
shouldn’t interfere with state is-
sues.
  “It would be a nice convenience 
for people, but the government 
needs to learn its place,” he said.
  But Klein said that government 
was created to serve the public, 
and the railway will do so because it is a high-tech way to be environ-mentally friendly and will create 
jobs.
  “These are the kind of economic 
projects that we should be invest-
ing in,” she said.
  Steiner, a member of the UF 
Transportation Research Center, said she thinks the plan to build 
the track is a great idea but will 
only work if the local transporta-
tion systems are up to par.
  For the railway to be most effec-
tive, she said, travelers have to be 
able to get to and from the railroad 
station easily and quickly . If they 
can’t, travelers might get frustrated and just won’t use the railway.
  “Transit in Florida isn’t as good 
as similarly sized areas in the 
country ,” she said. “There are very 
many bus routes that only come 
once an hour.”
  She said one possibility is link-
ing up the new railway with Sun-
Rail, a commuter railway in Or-
lando.
  The U.S. Department of Trans-
portation also told Nelson that it intends to give Florida an addi-
tional $8 million to build a high-
speed railroad between Orlando 
and South Florida. RAIL , from page 1OnCampu s
Six safety zones will be open to students
thrown into the drunk tank,” Or-
lando said. “We want people who 
need help to get it.”
  In total, there will be six zones 
open to students. 
Opening and closing times for 
the stations vary, but generally the stations will be open from about 6 
p.m. to 3 a.m. Friday and noon to 3 a.m. Saturday.
  The zones were initially set up to 
provide medical help for students, but over the years the services pro-
vided have expanded to include 
help for more than just binge drink-ers, Orlando said.  “What we’ve found over the 
years in doing this is it’s not just 
people who’ve been drinking who 
ﬁ  nd themselves in trouble,” he said. “Cell phones run out of juice, some-
times heat gets to them, they get de-
hydrated, they forget where they’re staying, or they get separated from 
a friend.” ZONES , from page 1

UF coach Urban Meyer (front) spent part of the bye week studying the Gators’ offense. He said turnovers, a lack of big plays, passing inefficiency and red-zone struggles have been the biggest problems.
� HE WATCHED TAPE OF    
EVERY SNAP THIS SEASON.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator.org
 
Urban Meyer spent part of the 
bye week trying to solve the enigma 
that is Florida’s offense.
He went through each play the 
unit, which is ranked ninth in the Southeastern Conference in scoring and total yards, has run this season and analyzed them. He came back with four problems to fix: turnovers, the lack of big plays, inefficiency in the passing game and red-zone struggles.
If quarterback John Brantley can 
raise his passing efficiency rating of 117.9 (10th in the conference) it would help resolve a lot of the of-fense’s struggles. Meyer noted that he expects quarterbacks in his sys-tem to post a rating of 165.“[The passer rating is] a multi-
tude of issues that need to be cor -
rected,” Meyer said. “No. 1 would be drops, No. 2 would be protection 
issues between the offensive line and 
backs and No. 3 would be execution of the play.”
One thing he did not include as 
a reason for the low number was of-fensive coordinator Steve Addazio’s play-calling. 
“We don’t have a bad play ,” 
Meyer said. “I don’t allow that. 
That’s kind of my job. There’s no 
such thing as saying, ‘That’s a bad play.’
“Are there times where I would 
have rather run this as opposed to this? Yeah. Is it a bad play? It’s not a bad play. It’s poorly executed be-cause we didn’t efficiently practice it.”
Injury Report: The Gators also 
used their week off to heal.

offense’s problems

SEE FOOTBALL, p AGE 15
It’s tough to tell if he meant to, but Urban 
Meyer may have accidentally given the perfect answer to a season-long question 
Monday.
When asked if he watches Auburn quar -
terback Cam Newton’s games on TV , Meyer said, “It’s really hard, I’ll tell you that. I don’t 
watch much of it.”
Meyer — and a UF spokesman — went on 
to clarify that he meant it’s difficult to find 
time to watch the Tigers, who aren’t on the Gators’ schedule, but it seems to me that 
Meyer messed up and let some honesty slip 
out before backpedaling.
But we don’t need to know what Meyer 
really meant. We have common sense.
Since transferring away from Florida, 
Newton has gone beast mode for the Tigers while Florida’s offense has plodded along.
Auburn is off to an 8-0 start, and after 
shredding LSU for 217 rushing yards on Sat-
urday, Newton set a Southeastern Confer -
ence record for single-season rushing yards 
by a quarterback with 1,077 — 82 more than Florida has as a team.
All those rushing yards have meant less 
demand on his arm, but he’s ranked first in the conference in pass efficiency (UF’s John Brantley is No. 10). He also has 27 total touch-downs, while Florida’s 
offense has 22. 
He’s putting togeth-
er a masterpiece of a 
season and is the front-
runner for the Heisman 
Trophy.
What about that 
would be fun for Meyer 
to watch?
Plenty of people have cracked jokes this 
year about how a laptop swung the balance of power in the SEC, a reference to the trou-ble Newton landed in after buying a stolen 
computer and throwing it out the window 
when police came to his UF dorm.
But that isn’t what ended Newton’s career 
at Florida. The truth should be even tougher for Meyer to swallow.
Newton wasn’t kicked off the team for 
that incident (it takes a lot more than that to get the boot here). 
Nope, when Tim Tebow decided to come 
back for his senior season, Newton looked around and realized he’d have to sit behind Newton makes it hard for Gators to watch

Clay Burton is keeping it all in 
the family.
The three-star Venice High out-
side linebacker decided to join his 
older brother, UF freshman quar -
terback Trey Burton, in orange and blue next season when he orally 
committed to the Gators on Sunday 
night.
Burton, who is rated as the 31st-
best outside linebacker in the na-tion by Rivals.com, originally com-mitted to Notre Dame on Sept. 24. But that changed when Florida’s 
coaches offered him a scholarship 
over the weekend.
“I’m a Gator,” Burton told Scout.com. “It’s just an opportunity that I can’t pass up. I wasn’t ready a 
year ago, or even six months ago. 
But like my brother said, I’m ready now and I earned it.”
Offensive coordinator Steve 
Addazio made a trip to see Bur -
ton play against Sarasota High on Friday night and afterward told the three-star re-cruit to give UF 
coach Urban Meyer a call over the weekend.
When Burton called, he told 
Meyer he was ready to be a Gator, 
and the coach offered him a schol-
arship. After a conversation with his brother and thinking about the LB Burton to join 
brother at Florida

Alligator StaffDecision on Rainey’s status for Saturday to be made later this week
has been limited the past four games 
with a sprained left foot, ran on a treadmill Monday and Meyer expect-ed him to practice about 25 snaps. 
  His availability for Saturday’s 
game is still unknown, and freshman Andre Debose is questionable with an ankle injury.
  But UF received good news on 
kicker Caleb Sturgis. After missing the previous three games with a back injury, Sturgis will play against Geor-gia, Meyer said. Defensive tackle Jaye Howard is also expected to see action Saturday despite a sprained ankle.
  Rainey’s status still unknown:  
Meyer will not decide on junior Chris Rainey’s status for Saturday’s game until later this week.
  The wide receiver is eligible to 
play against Georgia but still has to fulﬁ  ll some behavioral obligations before being cleared for the game. Rainey has not played since Sept. 11 
against USF because of an aggravat-
ed stalking arrest.
  “He has really changed as a per-
son,” Brantley said. “He has changed his attitude toward football. He’s working really hard and he just wants to get back on the ﬁ  eld and play .” FOOTBALL , from page 14The Chosen One for another year, then beat out Brantley, 
who was being groomed as the quarterback of the future.
  The truth is, Meyer and his staff ﬂ  at-out missed on 
Newton’s talent. 
He never did anything particularly impressive at UF, 
but the ability to be the nation’s best player was there all along, and his coaches failed to realize that.  No matter how much blame Meyer deserves, this sim-
ple fact remains: A player who was at Florida could win the Heisman Trophy this season — at  Auburn.
  That’s a nightmare scenario for a coach, and to think 
Meyer is at peace with the situation is laughable.
  What Newton is doing in different shades of orange 
and blue is akin to long-distance torture for Florida, and if his on-ﬁ  eld performance hasn’t been enough, Newton 
twisted the knife last week in an interview with ESPN.com’s Mark Schlabach.
  “If it was up to me, I would still want to be at Flori-
da,” Newton said. “My heart is still at Florida because of 
the long-lasting relationships I have with my teammates there. Leaving them was the hardest part.”
  It should be hard for Meyer to watch Newton, and that 
should be hard to hear. 
  Not because he’s busy and deaf, but because he let his 
next great quarterback get away. MIKE , from page 14Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF men’s golf coach Buddy Alexander was looking for somebody to step up 
Monday, and the team responded to move up from 12th to ﬁ  fth place.
 UF SHOT 2-OVER IN THE SECOND 
ROUND TO MOVE INTO FIFTH AT THE ISLEWORTH COLLEGIATE INVITATIONAL.

 After playing its worst round of the season, 
the Florida men’s golf team rebounded Mon-
day at the Isleworth Collegiate Invitational.
  The No. 3 Gators shot the low round of the 
day to jump seven positions from 12th into a 
tie for ﬁ  fth.
  UF improved its score from the opening 
round by 15 shots, carding a 2-over 290 for a combined score of 595 (305-290, +19) on Mon-day.
  “What a difference a day makes,” coach 
Buddy Alexander said. “Today we did a lot of positive things. I am happy with the way we played today.”
  A familiar face was once again at the top of 
the Gators’ leaderboard as senior Bank Vong-
vanij made four birdies en route to a 2-under 
70. 
Three of the birdies came in crunch time 
to help Vongvanij catapult back into the indi-
vidual top 10 after a 2-under, back-nine score 
of 34. 
  The senior is tied for sixth at even par af-
ter ﬁ  nishing in 22nd following a ﬁ  rst round in which he shot 2-over.
  Alexander vented frustrations following 
Sunday’s round, saying “someone has to step up” after a poor showing landed the Gators near the bottom of the ﬁ  eld. 
  If UF’s performance in the second round is 
any indication, the team took notice.
  Sophomore Phillip Choi ﬁ  red an even-par 
round of 72 on Monday, bettering his open-
ing-round score by six strokes. 
Choi bogeyed his ﬁ  rst hole, the par-4 10th, 
and the par-3 15th but countered with birdies 
at both par-5s on the outward nine. 
The rest was smooth sailing for Choi, who 
made nine straight pars coming in. His two-day total of 150 (+6) placed him in a tie for 29th.
  Stringing together consecutive over-par 
rounds is something sophomore standout Tyler McCumber hadn’t done all year. That changed Monday when McCumber carded a 1-over 73 to accompany his opening round of 76 (+4). 
He entered the tournament as the No. 5 
golfer in the country but is in a tie for 21st at Isleworth at 149 (+5).
  Sophomore Tommy Mou had two birdies 
and ﬁ  ve bogeys in his round of 3-over 75, two shots better than Sunday’s total. 
  Junior transfer Michael Furci, playing in his 
second tournament as a Gator, birdied two of his ﬁ  rst eight holes before making a triple bo-
gey on the 18th.
Furci had three more bogeys on the second 
nine to shoot a 4-over 76.

round. Fellow Southeastern Conference rival LSU is in second place.  Gators bounce back after rough opening round 16, ALLIGATOR  TUESDAY, OCTOBER 26, 2010

 The Gators wrapped up the ITA Southeast 
Regional at home Monday with freshman Ol-
ivia Janowicz earning the singles champion-ship and the team of Allie Will and Soﬁ  e Oyen capturing the doubles title. 
  Janowicz won in straight-sets (6-3, 7-5) 
against teammate Alex Cercone to capture her ﬁ  rst collegiate singles title. 
All three winners qualiﬁ  ed for the ITA Na-
tional Intercollegiate Indoor Championships.    
  Coach Roland Thornqvist said it is unusual 
for two freshmen from the same school to play in the ﬁ  nals, but he thought both players very well.
  “The level of tennis was excellent,” he said. 
“Alex tried to be aggressive and Olivia played 
great defense.” 
  However, Thornqvist said internal compe-
tition is different than competing against an-
other school. 
  “It’s not always the best barometer of where a player is because some players have an easier time competing against a teammate and some don’t,” he said. 
  In doubles action, the team of Will and 
Oyen defeated UF’s other duo of Joanna 
Mather and Caroline Hitimana (8-4) to capture the ﬁ  rst doubles title of their careers. 
  Their win embodied a week 
of excellent play in which both players were more aggressive 
than they had been at the ITA All-American, Thornqvist said. 
  “They were sort of ﬁ  nding their way in Los Angeles,” he said. “They were more aggres-sive this whole weekend. That’s the way they have to play .” 
  Despite ﬁ  nishing second, Mather and Hiti-
mana played well and showed clear mental and physical improvements, Thornqvist said. 
  Mather, who was injured during her ﬁ  rst 
two fall semesters, has practiced at full health this year and increased her already impressive 
speed.
  “She is one of the most athletic people we’ve 
had in the 10 years I’ve been coaching here,” 
Thornqvist said. “She’s the heart and soul and one of the hardest workers we have.”  Janowicz, Will, Oyen qualify for ITA national indoors
RB Blakely 
to announce decision   today
decision, Burton reneged on his 
commitment to Notre Dame and accepted Florida’s offer.
  As a junior, Burton made 47 
tackles and notched 11 sacks for Venice, according to the team’s website.
  But he wasn’t the only Venice 
player to go public with his com-
mitment Monday. Junior defen-
sive tackle Dante Phillips, who has a close relationship with the 
Burton brothers, also orally com-
mitted to Florida. He joined Citra North Marion High wide receiver Latroy Pittman as the Gators’ only commits for the 2012 class.
Blakely announcing:  Braden-
ton Manatee High four-star run-ning back Mike Blakely will an-nounce his college decision today at a 9 a.m. press conference in his 
school’s media center. 
  Blakely, rated as the No. 7 run-
ning back in the nation, will choose 
between Florida and Auburn.
  The four-star running back told 
reporters after his game Friday that he had already made his deci-sion and informed his family and coaches.
