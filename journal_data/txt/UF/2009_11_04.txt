Charles Roop met his long-time
girlfriend, Erin Pelton, when they
were lab partners in chemistryclass.
"When people asked how we
met we would joke that 'we just
had chemistry,"' he said.
She was an animal lover, and
the couple had a dog and three cats
together. Pelton, 24, graduated lastyear from UF with a degree in ani-
mal biology.

UF to give swine flu
vaccine to 800 students
UF's Student Health Care Center will
start vaccinating hundreds of students
against the novel HINI flu, also known
as swine flu, today at 8:30 a.m.
The center received 800 doses of the
vaccine for students Monday afternoon
and hopes to administer them all today.
Students who made appointments
online will be seen from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30
p.m. and given one spray of the vaccine in
each nostril.
As of about 8:45 p.m. Tuesday, all the
appointments were filled.
Kat Lindsey, marketing coordinator
for the health care center, said she expect-
ed all the slots to be filled up by the end of
Tuesday night.
If any doses of the vaccine are still
available at the end of today, they willlikely be administered another day, Lind-
sey said.
She said students will be asked to sub-
mit their completed medical questionnaire
and sign in on the front lawn of the infir-
mary before their appointments today.
Because of the large number of people
being seen in such a short period of time,
the University Police Department will be
on hand in case there are any problems,
she said.
In addition to the 800 doses designated
for students, UF was given another 200
doses for caretakers of children 6 months
or younger.
Appointments can be made over the
phone for students, faculty or staff who
qualify, Lindsey said.

SG president receives oar
trophy for UF football win
UF students walked away
with more than just a win af-
ter Saturday's game. They also
got a 10-foot oar carved from a
1,000-year-old cypress tree.
Student Body President Jor-
dan Johnson was presented with
the Okefenokee Oar after the
game. The oar represents a new
trophy presented to the winner
of the UF-Georgia game.
"It was so much more than
just being able to win a special
game," Johnson said. "It was the
start of a tradition."
The oar references a rivalry
that precedes the battle on the
football field. SG Press Secretary
Eric Conrad said it symbolizes
the historic conflict between UF
and Georgia that occurred when
the state boundary line was
drawn through Okefenokee.
Johnson said he is takingFRIDAY

Housing fair helps students
find apartments, houses
Students can explore housing
options during the off-campus
housing fair today from 10 a.m. to
2 p.m. at the Reitz Union Colon-
nade.
Ani Sanchez, cabinet director
for housing affairs, said the fair
will include information from
35 to 40 complexes and compa-
nies, including local apartments,
condos, apartment management
companies and real estate com-
panies.
Sanchez said students can ask
questions about leasing, the com-
mute to campus, apartment ame-
nities and parking.
She said the fair also helps stu-
dents by bringing together all of
the representatives in one loca-
tion.
"Instead of driving to every
different apartment complex and
sitting there and speaking with
them, it's fast and convenient,"
Sanchez said.
Apartment and condo repre-
sentatives will pass out brochures
with leasing information. They
will also give out T-shirts, candy
and prizes ranging from iPods to
school supplies.

City gives $50K to shelters
By GAIA BONINI
Alligator Contributing Writer
Warmed by a thin insulation of news-
paper on a bed of cardboard, huddled be-
neath old coats and torn blankets, curled
up on icy sidewalks. Too cold to move, but
nowhere to go anyway.
This is winter for the homeless.
There are nearly 1,600 homeless people
in Gainesville -more than a quarter of
whom are under the age of 18 -and only
about 350 shelter beds, according to Proj-
ect Grace, the city's 10-year plan to end
homelessness in Gainesville.
But the City of Gainesville and Alachua
County have each given $25,000 to the
Cold Night Shelter Program, which funds
temporary extra shelter for the homeless
when the weather is 45 degrees and below
from December to March.
The combined $50,000 will be divided
among local organizations that already
care for the homeless. Organizations like
St. Francis House and the Alachua County
Housing Authority can apply for funding
until Nov. 16.
Any nonprofit organization that can ac-
commodate homeless people is eligible for
the funding, said Teresa Osoba, Gaines-
ville's housing and development supervi-
sor.
Kent Vann, executive director of St.
Francis House, said in the event of a freeze
warning, he will never deny someone in
need."Everyone deserves a place to go on a
cold night without being turned away,"
he said.
Vann is applying for funding from the
program for the third year in a row. He
has never been denied.
This year, he said, he hopes to get
enough money from the program for 60
more cots.
"Everyone deserves a place to
go on a cold night without being
turned away."
Kevin Vann
executive director of St. Francis House
Any extra funding would go to blan-
kets, food and overhead costs like heat-
ing.
St. Francis House houses about 35 resi-
dents at a time but can support an addi-
tional 100 if necessary, said Vann.
Vann said on a typical night below 45
degrees, about 60 extra people come to the
house. They sleep on cots inside and are
given blankets and food during their stay.
He said college towns with sky-high
rent for even substandard housing are not
good places to live without money.
The Alachua County Coalition for the
Hungry and Homeless said on its Web
site, "It is sadly ironic that there are peo-
ple sleeping on the streets, in woods and
in parking lots amid a sea of 'for rent'
signs."SFC rejects smoking ban
* SMOKING IS PERMITTED IN
DESIGNATED 'SMOKING HUTS.'
By JENNIFER BATE
Alligator Contributing Writer
Santa Fe College opted not to follow
UF's lead by banning smoking on cam-
pus.
SFC's College Senate voted 17-9
against a campus-wide ban during its
general meeting Tuesday.
Santa Fe College President Jackson
Sasser said he would not enforce the
ban unless the Career Services, College
Senate and Student Senate are in all in
favor the ban. The College Senate is
composed of SFC faculty members, un-
like the Student Senate, which voted to
oppose the ban last week.
However, all three groups agreed
that smoking is a problem at Santa Fe
and that regulations must be tightened
so people don't abuse the privilege.
Some students voiced concerns that
that the ban would push all smokers to
parking lots, where accidents would be
more likely to occur. Currently, smok-
ing is permitted in designated "smok-ing huts" and in areas away from build-
ings.
Student Senate Internal Affairs Di-
rector and Health Science Senator Eric
Florestan addressed the College Sen-
ate before the vote. He reminded the
College Senate that the Student Senate
voted against the ban 42-10 and pointed
out that the current rules are not en-
forced well.
Florestan said the Student Senate
would be reviewing the current situa-
tion to better enforce existing regula-
tions and expressed interest in working
with the College Senate in lieu of a ban.
Many faculty members said they felt
that it was better to try to enforce cur-
rent smoking restrictions before estab-
lishing a ban.
While the ban did not pass, members
of the College Senate did pass a motion
to establish a committee to re-evaluate
smoking areas and make recommenda-
tions for changes, research the conse-
quences of a campus-wide smoking ban
and work with student government to
better enforce current restrictions.

Senators, students discuss controversial UN report
Unite Party Sen. Jesse Sherman speaks to the Student Senate about an upcoming
resolution concerning the Goldstone Report in the Reitz Union Tuesday night.* A RESOLUTION OPPOSING THE
REPORT WILL BE PRESENTED SOON.
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
The Senate chambers were a bit more
crowded than usual Tuesday night when about
30 students stuffed into rows and crowded the
aisles to discuss an upcoming resolution re-
garding a report on last winter's Gaza conflict.
The resolution, which will be heard by the
Student Senate in the upcoming weeks, sup-
ports the state of Israel and denounces the
Goldstone report, a UN report accusing Israel
and Hamas of war crimes during Israel's con-
flict with Palestine.
The U.S. House of Representatives approved
a resolution Tuesday night that denounced the
Goldstone report because of its bias.
A resolution is a piece of legislation that
states the opinion of the Senate or the House,
but does not take any action.
Husam Wahdan, the president of Students
for Justice in Palestine, said he opposed the
resolution because it did not represent an issue
that affected UF students.
He questioned the ability of Senators to rep-
resent the interests of UF's 50,000 students on
an international issue."It puzzles me that such a resolution has
even been proposed," Wahdan said.
However, Rafael Yaniz, the president of
Gators for Israel and one of the resolution's au-
thors, disagreed. He said the Goldstone report
would have an impact on UF's about 7,300 Jew-
ish students. The debate lasted about an hour.
Orange and Blue Party Sen. Jonathan Ossip,
who represents the Murphree Area, encour-
aged senators to read the
House and Senate bills about
the Goldstone report men-
tioned in the Student Senate
resolution before voting.
Later on in the meeting,
Orange and Blue Party sena-
tors and Progress Party sena-
ossip tors introduced a bill that
would replace "I Voted"
stickers with an "I Voted" rubber stamp.
Author of the bill Kevin Seymour said the
stamp would make elections more economical.
He said it would save about $200 in the ini-
tial election it was used and then $400 every se-
mester after that.
Unite Party Sen. Josh Roberts, who repre-
sents the college of agriculture, questioned how
the bill would help improve the election pro-
cess. He said stickers are a matter of American
pride.
The bill did not pass.

Students dance to new beat in Reitz
A new dance game, Pump It Up 2 Exceed, sits in the Reitz Union
Game Room Tuesday.By JARED MISNER
Alligator Writer
Dan Linehan doesn't know any
of their names. But after three years
behind the desk at the Reitz Union
Game Room, Linehan has accrued
a slew of nicknames for the Dance
Dance Revolution "regulars."
He's seen the dance enthusiasts
wait in lines 10 to 15 people long.
And as of mid-last week, UF's
DDR regulars no longer have to
wait in such long lines to get their
platform-stomping, techno-beat
hopping dance fix as the Reitz
Union Game Room installed its
second dance-themed arcade game,
Pump It Up 2 Exceed.
"There's this one guy, I don't
know his real name, but he plays
[DDR] in his socks and he brings
extra socks 'cause he burns through
'em," said Linehan, student assis-
tant manager of the Reitz Union
Game Room. "He refuses to play in
his shoes because he says he can't
'feel the machine."'
Kurt Folsom, who owns the
company that supplies the Reitz
Union Game Room with its arcade
games, expects the new dance-
themed video game to perform
just as well or better than the olderDDR game despite the new game's
75-cent-per-play price tag.
The current DDR system costs
50 cents.
"It came out hot, and it's been
very consistent," Folsom said of the
dance-themed video game craze.
"There's this one guy, I
don't know his real name,
but he plays [DDR] in his
socks and he brings extra
socks 'cause he burns
through 'em."
Dan Linehan
Reitz Union Game Room student
assistant manager
Some UF students and Game
Room regulars describe the new
dance-themed video game as
something other than "hot."
"I played [Pump It Up 2 Ex-
ceed]. I'm not a big fan of it," said
Melinda Hua, as J.P. Ruiz, a bio-
chemistry major, conquered the
DDR system behind her. "The mu-
sic isn't as cool, and it takes away
from playing DDR."
The installation of Pump It Up
2 Exceed signals a recent surging
trend in the popularity of "exer-games," video games that engage
the player in some form of physical
activity, including DDR and Nin-
tendo's Wii Fit.
School systems across the coun-
try are even installing DDR sys-
tems or other dance-themed video
games in their physical education
departments as a supplement to
childhood exercise programs.
Regardless of the health benefits
these dance-themed video games
may provide, Charlotte Dare, Reitz
Union Game Room manager, fore-
sees increased happiness among
exer-game enthusiasts with the de-
cision to install the Game Room's
second such game.
"[The regulars] were on the new
game until the time we opened un-
til the time we closed," Dare said,
referring to Pump It Up 2 Exceed's
inauguration last week.
Although Hua and Linehan
agreed that some Game Room reg-
ulars don't like the new beat-box-
ing addition to the arcade, Linehan
suggested a reason.
"The regulars are so good at the
old machine," he said. "They don't
want to be caught doing bad at the
new one. A lot of them don't like
that, but a lot of them see it as a
challenge."

UF students and faculty took a
crafty approach Tuesday at Style
Your Sole, an event organized by
the UF Office of Sustainability,
where participants purchased
and decorated a pair of TOMS
Shoes at the Reitz Union Colon-
nade.
"People think of sustainability
just as an environmental issue,
but we're looking at social as-
pects," said Stephanie Sims, pro-
gram assistant with the UF Office
of Sustainability.
TOMS has gained infamy for
its charitable mission: For every
pair purchased, TOMS donates a
pair of shoes to a child in need.
Paint, ribbon and glitter
were among the provided artis-
tic media. Innovative students
wrapped their canvas sneakers
in tape, painting over the lines to
create geometrical patterns and
designs.
"People think of sustain-
ability just as an environ-
mental issue, but we're
looking at social aspects."
Stephanie Sims
UF Office of Sustainability program
assistant
UF sophomore Amanda As-
chenbrenner bought her pair of
TOMS Shoes at the event, splash-
ing yellow and red paint on the
bare canvas and quoting Dr.
Seuss' "Oh the Places You'll Go"
on the side of the sneakers.
The shoes start at about $44.
"You spend about the same on
a pair of shoes anyway," Aschen-
brenner said. "But you're getting
two pairs of shoes."
Roberto Evans, owner of The
Exchange, an authorized retailer
of TOMS Shoes, guided students
through the design process. An
industry insider, he's ready for a
moral makeover in the business
market.
"People buy shoes all the time,
but they're often not made under
very ethical conditions," Evans
said. "Our buying practices can
make a big difference for others."
And, for now, that change is
evolving one shoe at a time.
Evans sold about 40 pairs of
shoes.
"We didn't anticipate such a
response," Evans said. "It's like,
'Dude, that's a lot of kids that get
shoes."'

he death of Erin Pelton Monday night is a tragedy to
say the least. A 2008 UF graduate with an animal biol-
ogy degree, she aspired to become a veterinarian, and
friends say she had a promising future.
Stepping off an RTS bus, Pelton followed a group of
people crossing Archer road. A driver who was not intoxi-
cated and was following the speed limit swerved to avoid the
group, hitting Pelton.
The loss of this young woman follows two similar traf-
fic fatalities that occurred earlier this year, according to the
Gainesville Police Department.
Because bus stops are not always placed at or near inter-
sections, but rather are scattered all along busy roads, some
students are left to cross three and four lanes to reach their
destination. The danger is compounded at night, when poor-
ly lit roads make crossing students less visible.
Expanding driver and pedestrian awareness about this is-
sue is critical to ensuring the safety of UF students and all
Gainesville pedestrians.
Also, by identifying stops where people commonly cross
busy roads, RTS can adjust routes to provide safer alterna-
tives.
Ultimately, we would like to see RTS place as many bus
stops as possible near crosswalks and intersections, while
identifying alternative routes specifically aimed at reducing
this risk.
The loss of one person justifies a careful consideration of
the problem. Three deaths in one year, along with those in
years past, demands prompt action.
Mix It Up
Last month, an interra-cial couple seeking
marriage license was
turned away by a Louisiana
justice of the peace on the
grounds that their marriage
was "mixed." The refusal
was met with an eruption
of criticism from civil rights
groups and public officials,
including Louisiana's gover-
nor, Bobby Jindal.
Finally bowing to mount-
ing pressure, the justice in
question, Keith Bardwell, re-
signed Tuesday, according to
an Associated Press article.
We say good riddance.
When asked about the inci-
dent, Bardwell (a white man)
admitted that he has a habit
of turning away interracial
couples because the children
of these couples will suffer in
life.
It's 2009. We have an in-
terracial president. We are
shocked that people like this
justice still exist, let alone that
they are allowed to hold pub-lic office.
But apparently Bardwell is
not a relic of bad times passed.
Rather, he is an example of the
work America has left to do.
So, it is without any sense
of irony that the liberal-social-
ist-left-wing-conspirators at
the Alligator Editorial Board
congratulate Republican Gov.
Jindal -gasp -for his out-
spoken criticism of this man
and his ignorant bigotry.
Jindal, an ethnic Indian
born and raised in the south-
ern state of Louisiana, likely
faced some of the same bigot-
ry that he publicly denounced
in the weeks since this issue
hit the headlines.
It would have been easy
to stay out of the public dis-
course, or at the very least,
make a few passing remarks
about the issue. But Gov.
Jindal kept the pressure on,
with public statements that
undoubtedly contributed to
Bardwell's resignation.
For that, we thank Gov.
Jindal.

Letters to the Editor
Murty's statements about Republicans biased
This is in response to Paul Murty's article on Monday
that could only be described as a "slaughter of logic."
Paul, your article was nothing short of a biased attempt
to prove that the Republicans are all evil, racist Hallibur-
ton employees who rape women. I am not kidding. At one
point in your article, you somehow deduce that U.S. Rep.
Joe Wilson was a racist for saying "you lie" to Obama.
Seriously Paul, that's the biggest stretch I have ever
seen. Your implied statement was that anyone in disagree-
ment with Obama is a racist. When Joe Wilson said "you
lie," did you somehow hear "death to minorities?" Did Joe
say that all black Americans are liars during the Obama
speech? The fact that you tried to make this connection,
in the beginning of your article no less, turned me off to
everything you had to say, and made you look like a fool.
As far as the rest of your article, you blasted Republi-
cans for some invented smear campaign against ACORN
without rebutting any of the issues. In the very next para-
graph, you started a smear campaign of your own by
equating Republican representatives with rapists, and
what the heck, threw in a Halliburton reference as well.
To sum up Paul Murty's argument: Republicans didn't
vote for some bill, so they must support rape. And they
are racists, obviously.

Machen responded well to rusting bicycle problem
This letter is to commend President Bernie Machen for
an extremely prompt response to an e-mail I wrote to him
regarding the rusting hulks of bicycles that have dotted
campus since I arrived in fall 2008 as a graduate student.
I wrote this e-mail Monday afternoon expressing my dis-
may at having to constantly dodge the rusty carcases of
abandoned bikes, and was pleasantly surprised to receive
a personal response that evening. Further, a phone call
came from the appropriate person at UPD the next morn-
ing, with a pledge that the issue would be handled imme-
diately. When I arrived at ARCH today, the worst of the
problem was gone. Kudos to President Machen for mak-
ing the time to care about the small problems.

Library patron should be commended for reporting
lewd behavior
I am writing to give my full support behind Tuesday's
Alligator editorial, "Public Porn." Reading that a brave
patron of Library West had the courage to turn in this
"jerking-class hero," Christopher Wallace, did nothing
short of erect a smile on my face.I sincerely hope that this will send a message to all po-
tential library patrons considering checking out their own
copy of Moby Dick at our sanctuary of wisdom and hu-
mility.
The last thing I want is the phrase "taking out a book
from the library" to mean something dirty. A few months
ago, I thought "The First Lady Touched the Queen" head-
line was a euphemism for masturbation, which should be
a clear indication that my mind doesn't need a lower gut-
ter to dwell in. But I digress.
Those looking to get their jollies needn't come prema-
turely to the wholesome library for a quick fix. So, to all
those considering committing a similar offense, let this be
a warning: Our library is not the place to thrust your "jack
of all trades" personality on the student body. That being
said, kudos to the student who came forward to report
such lewd behavior. You handled yourself well. Library
West "patron," not so much.

Israel not being held accountable for actions
Israel has repeatedly defied United Nations resolu-
tions. What other developed country in the world would
be allowed this lawless refusal to abide by UN resolu-
tions? Moreover, since its occupation of the Palestinian
Territories in 1967, Israel has not implemented one single
resolution stipulating its withdrawal from the occupied
territories and refraining from all activities in these ter-
ritories.
The settlements, the wall, the checkpoints, the bypass
roads, the detention of political prisoners, the eviction of
homes and other endless measures continue with glaring
injustice, while the international community watches, and
the US continues to pamper Israel with more funding and
more moral support.
No wonder Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netan-
yahu thought it was a joke for President Obama to ask
him to freeze the settlements and took no heed of it. Why
does everyone bend to Israel when it is the aggressor, the
oppressor and the only country in the region that has a
stock-pile of nuclear weapons, and has not even signed
the non-proliferation treaty or allowed the inspection of
its nuclear activity?
Yet they have the audacity to divert all the attention
from its noncompliance with UN resolutions and its war
crimes and violations of human rights, which appear so
clearly in the Goldstone report, by focusing on Iran being
the threat to the region. Once again, Israel succeeded in
pulling wool over the eyes of the international commu-
nity. I think it is due time for Israel to be held accountable
for its actions.

Guest column
Column doesn't
present all facts
aul Murty's Tuesday column was so
shamefully dishonest that I felt I had to
respond. He claims the Republicans are
not listening to voters, when it is the Demo-
crats in Congress who have pushed through
multiple 1,000-plus page bills they haven't
read (and have broken campaign promises by
not giving the public time to read them, ei-
Benjamin ther). The latest Pew poll
shows only 34 percent
Camenker support for the new con-
Speaking Out gressional health plan,
with an opposition of 47
percent. And the opposition is growing. Mr.
Murty, it is not the Republicans who are ig-
noring the will of the people.
Murty rightly calls out Rep. Joe Wilson,
R-S.C., for his indefensible outburst during
President Obama's health care speech. Then,
he undermines whatever credibility he had
by going on to say that it was "racially mo-
tivated." How patently ridiculous. But this is
the mindset of people like Murty, and race is
always at the forefront of their thought. When
Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., has an outburst,
and calls a lobbyist a "K Street whore" or
claims Republicans want you to "die quick-
ly," race has nothing to do with it. Not so
for attacks on President Obama. In Murty's
world, no one can legitimately be taking issue
with Obama's "brilliant" policies. Therefore,
it must be race. I guess the Iraqi who threw
a shoe at Bush was just a racist, and had no
qualm with his administration. When Bush
was interrupted at Monticello, it was because
he was white. Obama called Kanye West a
"jackass." Is he a racist, too? Murty is simply
drowning in Kool-Aid. Hiding behind race is
intellectually dishonest and cowardly.
Murty's depiction of ACORN serves to
crystallize how far he will go to push an intel-
lectually dishonest viewpoint. The prostitute
intending to set up a brothel and import 13
very young" (underage) girls from El Salva-
dor in as sex slaves is magically transformed,
under the lenses of Murty's rose-colored
glasses, into "a seemingly poor woman that
was simply trying to support herself in life."
The pimp helping her? Erased from Murty's
narrative.
Murty argues that these two individuals are
not representative of the organization. He's
either lying or uninformed. From his record
so far, I believe the former. In fact, ACORN's
actions are systemic. It has been taped helping
the undercover pimp and prostitute in Balti-
more, Washington D.C., Brooklyn, San Diego,
San Bernardino and elsewhere. When ACORN
claimed that it had "kicked them out" from
Philadelphia, the Philadelphia video was re-
leased -proving that ACORN employees
were not only willing to help import underage
sex slaves, but lie about it. Murty does not tell
you this. He does not tell you that the Demo-
cratic Congress found it more than convincing
enough to revoke ACORN's funding. He does
not tell you that they have been disassociated
with the 2010 Census. Stop retelling news the
way you wish it happened, Mr. Murty, or it
won't be long until someone (another obvious
racist) screams "You lie!" at you.

Santa Fe recycles costumes for kids
By MELINDA CARSTENSEN
Alligator Contributing Writer
All around Gainesville, already-worn Halloween costumes
hang in closets, waiting to gather dust.
But through the Santa Fe College Office of Community
Service, once-worn Halloween costumes don't have to go to
waste.
Starting this week, SFC is collecting Halloween costumes
that will be donated to families in need. Costumes can be
dropped off at the SFC Student Leadership and Activities,
room S-147, today through Nov. 13 before 4 p.m.
The costumes will be donated through organizations in-
cluding the Friends of the Micanopy Library, the Children's
Home Society of Florida and schools, said Samantha Rist, an
SFC Graduate Assistant.
"It's so easy," Rist said. "All you have to do is drop the
costumes off, and kids will have new ones to wear next year."
This is the second year the SFC Office of Community Service
has held their Halloween costume drive. Last year, they re-ceived about 100 outfits.
"Sometimes it's hard to motivate people to donate," she said.
"But no one really wears their costumes more than once."
Tony Barakat, a graduate accounting student at UF, said
people don't like repeating costumes because each year cos-
tume trends change.
"I know some people who wore more than one costume
this year, and they're probably never going to wear either of
them again," Barakat said. "I wouldn't be surprised if they
wanted to donate them."
Sally Stein, program director of Friends of the Micanopy Li-
brary Tutoring Program, said drives like this mean a lot to their
elementary and middle school students. A lot of the students
in the program are on free or reduced-price lunches, so their
families don't have enough money to buy things that aren't
essential, Stein said.
Additionally, many Micanopy residents don't have access
to the same resources as people in bigger cities, Stein said.
"For them to be able to look forward to having something to
be [for Halloween] next year means a lot," she said.
Gator alum joins race for governor
By MATT HARRINGER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Despite opposition from her own
party, state Sen. Paula Dockery, a UF
alumna, filed paperwork Tuesday to run
against Attorney General Bill McCollum
for the Republican nomination for gov-
ernor.
The Republican Party of Florida and
most of the party's leadership have al-
ready endorsed McCollum, also a Gator.
Former Governor Jeb Bush announced
his support in a press release Tuesday,
and Sen. Mike Haridopolos, a UF lectur-
er, said he believes McCollum is the best
candidate for the Republican Party.
Dockery, who represents Lakeland,
isn't deterred by having to face the
leadership of her party. She said she be-
lieves her underdog status is a strength
because Republican voters don't want"There is only so much I can
do as one of 40 senators. But
there's a heck of a lot I can do
as governor."

State senator
the party leadership deciding for whom
they vote.
But Dockery's primary opponent
isn't worried.
"This announcement wasn't unex-
pected and is not of particular concern,"
McCollum said. "We're focused on our
campaign and on the striking contrast
between myself and Alex Sink on the is-
sues of great importance for our state."
Alex Sink, the state's CFO, is the
Democratic nominee for governor.
Dockery has represented Lakeland
in the state's legislature since 1996. Thesenator started to make statewide head-
lines two years ago when she began her
crusade against a $641 million deal with
CSX, one of the nation's largest railroad
companies, to create a commuter rail
system for central Florida.
"I worked very hard. The amount of
political pressure on the issue was like
none I've ever seen," Dockery said, add-
ing that she was up against 200 lobbyists
who supported the legislation.
After winning her battle, people from
across the state began urging her to run
for governor. Dockery was planning on
retiring from politics after she was term-
limited in 2012, but when she was still
receiving letters in June, she began to
change her mind.
"There is only so much I can do as
one of 40 senators," Dockery said. "But
there's a heck of a lot I can do as gover-
nor.

platform and a UF political science pro-

Witnesses said the driver, whose blood test showed

tried to swerve out of the way. Police are still investigat-

Officers responded to calls from witnesses at 6:19
p.m., and Pelton was pronounced dead after arriving at
the new trauma unit of Shands at UF, Kameg said.
Kameg said this is the third traffic
fatality of its kind this year.
"Unfortunately, this highlights an
issue we have in this community," he
said. "We have a lot of people and a
lot of cars.trying to occupy the same

"She was a very friendly person," he said.
Dr. Ray Sudjak worked with Pelton very closely for
the past three and a half years at the Gainesville Animal
Hospital on Sixth Avenue and said she'll be missed by
everyone at the clinic.
"If I had a daughter, I'd want her tobe just like her," he
said. "She would have made a difference in the world.

0 THE MONEY WILL BENEFIT GATORS
MARCH FOR BABIES.
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Student Government Cabinet is hosting a
spare change drive this week to raise money for
the Gators March for Babies on Sunday.
A table will be set up every day this week from
9:30 a.m. to 3p.m. on the Reitz Union Colonnade.
Students can drop off their spare change and
pick up a flier with more information on the 5K
run, which will start on Turlington Plaza.
Daniela Guanipa, director of the Community
Involvement Cabinet, said the spare change drive
allows other students who are not involved in the
Gator March for Babies to contribute.
"It's something easy," Guanipa said. "They
don't have to go out of their way if they're going
into the Reitz to get lunch or go into the offices up
there. They can just drop off their change."
The Cabinet is also hosting a fundraiser at
TCBY from p.m. to 10p.m. on Friday.
In addition to the fundraisers, the Cabinet is
asking for each SG and Cabinet member partici-
pating in the run to donate $10.
Guanipa said she has hosted spare change
drives for other organizations in the past. She said
that they can raise as much as $300 in loose change
per day.
"People are willing to give it up, and there are
so may people in this school. I think it will be suc-
cessful," Guanipa said.
Alex Andrade, director of the Research Cabinet
said the spare change drive helps raise awareness
and money for the event. He estimated that about
$11 was collected Tuesday morning.
"The goal is just to collect as much money as
possible for the run," she said.

GETTING STARTED
How Do I Find An Apartment?
Check with the office of Off-Campus Life
at 352 392 1261 x 214 or their website at http://
www.dso.ufl.edu/offcampus for assistance.
Rental opportunities may also be found
in the classified sections of The Gainesville
Sun, The Independent Florida Alligator, and
bulletin boards around campus.
Can I Be Evicted If I Pay "My" Rent
and My Roommates Don't?
Usually. Most leases provide that the
tenants are jointly and severally liable for
the entire rent. This means the landlord can
evict you unless the full rent is paid.
It is possible for you to sue your room-
mates in small claims court to collect their
share of the rent and utilities. A written
roommate agreement will be helpful in prov-
ing your case in court.
Given the difficulty of collecting money
on a judgment quickly, the best thing you
can do is obtain new roommates.
So What If I Get Sued? I Have No Money!
Any judgment for money damages is
enforceable for at least 20 years and earns
interest. A judgment may be enforced by
seizing your wages, bank accounts, or your
personal property. A judgment will also ad-
versely affect your credit rating.
What Should I Do Before I Sign a Lease?
DO:
-Read the lease and make sure you under-
stand it.
-Review a copy of the lease with an attor-
ney prior to signing it.
-Expect to pay full rent, not just your share.
This is what "joint and several" liability means,
a term included or implied in nearly all leases.

What Should I Look For
In An Apartment?
Application Deposits: Never put
down a deposit to hold an apartment
unless you have a written agreement
indicating whether it is refundable.
Model Apartments: Never sign a
lease based upon a model. Insist on
seeing your actual apartment.
Cost: Can you afford it? Even if your
roommates leave?
Safety: Inspect the locks on the doors
and windows -is there a deadbolt on
the front door? Do sliding glass doors
have adequate locks to deter forced
entry? Are the hallways and parking
lots well lit? Make sure tree limbs and
shrubs in front of the apartment are well
trimmed.
You can contact the Alachua Coun-
ty Sheriff's Office or the Gainesville Po-
lice Department for information on
crime in the area.
Function: At move-in, check all
plumbing and appliances. Run water in
sinks, showers and tubs, flush toilets, and
check air conditioning and heating.
Inventory: Note all defects on the
inventory sheet or check-in list signed
by the landlord or an impartial Witness.
Photograph or videotape the apart-
ment at movie-in.
Appearance: Is it clean? Do the car-
pets look worn or smell bad? Has the
apartment been painted recently? Do
the walls have nail holes?
In some Gainesville neighborhoods,
only three unrelated persons may live
together. Check with the city if you plan
on having more than two roommates.
Retain a copy of the lease and all at-
tachments or addendum to the lease
for your records. Have all promised re-
pairs and improvements written into the
lease and signed by the landlord.
Get clear written permission for any
pets.

GETTING
EVICTED
What Exactly Is An Eviction?
An eviction is the formal end to your eight to
occupy the apartment. It does not end your duty to
pay rent. An eviction starts with a Summons. You
must file an Answer within 5 days. Contact an at-
torney immediately. If the court rules against you,
ajudgment for possession of the apartment, unpaid
rent, late fees, interest, court costs and attorney's
fees will be entered for the landlord. The sheriff
will post a notice at the apartment that requires
you to vacate within 24 hours. If you do not vacate
within 24 hours, the sheriff will remove you and
your personal property from the apartment.
How Do I Find A Good Roommate?
Check the Off-Campus Life website at
http://www.dso.ufl.edu/offcampus. Check bul-
letin boards around campus and classified ads
as additional sources. Discuss with potential
roommates preferences in food, music, personal
habits, sleeping and study hours, friends and
finances. An open and frank appraisal of each
other's likes, dislikes, and expectations will in-
crease the chances of an enjoyable shared living
experience. A written roommate agreement is
advisable.
Do I Really Need Insurance For MY Per-
sonal Property?
Yes. Unless you are financially able to replace all
your belongings, you should have insurance. ProperWEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2009 0 STUDENT LIVING GUIDE, ALLIGATOR, 5
What Are My Duties As A Tenant?
-First, last and always, PAY RENT!
-Comply with all other lease terms.
Comply with all rules and regulations.
* Comply with housing and
health codes.
* Comply with all zoning restrictions.
* Keep the apartment clean
and sanitary.
-Keep plumbing fixtures sanitary.
* Do not damage the apartment.
-Do not disturb your neighbors.
insurance coverage will protect you against the loss
of your valuables in most circumstances. Landlords
are legally responsibly for such losses only under
very specific, limited circumstances that may be
very difficult to prove in court.
If you are a resident-relative of your parents,
your personal property may be insured through their
homeowner's policy. Have your parents confirm
the coverage in writing with their insurance agent.
If coverage is not available through your parents'
homeowner's policy, you may be able to purchase
renter's insurance. Even with insurance, there are
certain precautions you should always take. Always
lock your apartment securely even if you are only
going next door. Never leave jewelry, cameras,
cash, checkbooks, credit cards, electronics, or other
valuables in plain view.My Landlord Refuses
to Make Repairs, What Can I Do?
You MAY be able either to withhold your
rent or terminate your lease if the problem con-
stitutes a material breach of the lease or the Act.
You must follow the exact requirements of the
Act. You must give the landlord a written notice
demanding the repairs be made in seven days.
The notice must indicate to terminate the lease
or withhold rent if the repairs are not made. This
is a complicated process and the legal conse-
quences are very serious. Do not attempt to ter-
minate your lease or withhold rent without first
obtaining legal advice.
Can I Deduct Repair Costs
From My Rent?
No. The Act does not authorize you to make
repairs or to recover the cost of such repairs. In
fact, most apartment leases prohibit repairs by ten-
ants. When the landlord refuses to make repairs,
the Act gives you a qualified right to terminate the
lease or withhold rent. As previously indicated,
you should consult an attorney before attempting
to terminate the lease or withhold rent.
Can I use My Security Deposit
for the Last Month's Rent?
No. Landlords can legally evict you for
non-payment of rent even when your "security
deposit" is equal to your last month's rent. The
purpose of the security deposit is to protect the
landlord against damages to the apartment.Does the Law Require Interest
Payments on Security Deposits?
Landlords must hold security deposits in one
of three methods. Two methods of holding the
deposits require interest to be paid. The method
which does not require interest payment is the
one most landlords use. The landlord is required
to inform you in writing how your deposit is be-
ing held, where it is held, and whether you will
receive interest.
What Can I Do If My Landlord Doesn't
Return My Deposit?
A landlord shallhave 15 days after termination
of the lease to return the security deposit together
with interest if otherwise required, if he or she
does not intend to impose a claim on the security
deposit. If the landlord intends to impose a claim
in the security deposit, he or she shall have 30
days to give the tenant written notice by certified
mail, stating how much is going to deducted and
why. You must object to the deduction in writing
within 15 days from the date you receive the no-
tice, or the landlord will be authorized to deduct
his or her claim from your security deposit.
If the landlord fails to give the required no-
tice within the 30-day period, he or she forfeits
the right to impose a claim upon the security de-
posit.
However, if you damaged the apartment, the
landlord can sue you even when the 30-day no-
tice is not given. Because the landlord can also
get court costs and attorney's fees, you should
consult an attorney before filing any lawsuits.

GETTING IT BACK
What Steps Can I Take To Protect My
Security Deposit?
When you take occupancy of the apartment,
complete a thorough written inventory of the
apartment's condition and have the landlord or
an impartial witness sign the inventory. Make
sure you keep a copy of the inventory. This
helps protect you from the landlord claiming
you caused pre-existing damage.
When you move out, clean the apartment
completely and thoroughly. Some landlords
provide a checklist outlining the cleaning
they expect you to do. Keep all your receipts
for cleaning supplies and professional carpetcleaning as evidence.
Before you leave, ask the landlord to in-
spect the apartment with you. Complete a
move-out checklist and make sure the landlord
signs and dates it. Use an impartial witness if
the landlord is not available or refuses your re-
quest. Move-in and move-out photographs or
videotape are strongly recommended in case
there is a dispute.
What Can I Do About Noisy Neighbors?
Try to reason with the neighbor to reach an
acceptable compromise. Thin walls and con-
flcting schedules make some amount of noise
disturbance an unavoidable reality of apart-ment living.
Ask the landlord for assistance. If the land-
lord refuses to correct the problem, you may
be able to break your lease. Because the law
in this area is so poorly developed, legal repre-
sentation is a necessity.
In extreme cases, call the police and report
the matter. Unfortunately, this can lead to re-
venge and reprisals.
I Can't Stand My Roommate.
What Can I Do?
Discuss the matter with your roommate
immediately. Don't ignore the problem with
the hope that it will go away. A little give andtake may result in a livable compromise.
Under the Act, your landlord is not re-
sponsible for most roommate disputes. If your
roommate is violating the lease, you should
consult an attorney.
Can My Rent Be Increased
During My Lease Term?
Not unless the lease contains a specific
provision allowing for a rent increase. From
the tenant's perspective, one of the primary
reasons for having a written lease is to lock in
the rent for the rental period. Normally, you
should not sign a lease providing for a rent in-
crease.

Can My Landlord Enter My Apartment
Without Notice?
No. Unless there is an emergency or you
have abandoned your apartment, the land-
lord must provide reasonable notice and
obtain your consent prior to entering your
apartment.
You cannot unreasonably withhold
consent. If the landlord persists in entering
without notice or consent, contact an attor-
ney.
How Soon Must I Renew My Lease?
There is no time period established
by the Act. You should not sign a lease
that provides for automatic renewals of
requires you to give the landlord a no-
tice of nonrenewal. If you do sign such
a lease, you must strictly comply with
the notice requirements imposed by the
lease.
If the lease does not specify other-
wise, renewals are a matter of general
contract law. The landlord cannot force
you to renew prior to the end of your
lease. However, if you do not renew by
the landlord's "deadline," the landlord
may rent your apartment to someone
else.WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2009 U STUDENT LIVING GUIDE, ALLIGATOR, 7
Can I Break My Lease Because.
I am graduating? No!
My roommate left? No!
I cannot afford the rent? No!
I need to work this summer? No!
The neighborhood is unsafe? No!
Under the Act, you can only terminate
the lease if the landlord is materially violat-
ing your lease or the Act. You should obtain
legal advice before attempting to terminate
your lease. In many cases, the best thing you
can do is find replacement tenants.GETTING OUT
Can I Sublet My Apartment?
Usually. The landlord cannot unreason-
ably withhold consent to an assignment or
sublease. The landlord may require potential
replacement tenants to submit an applica-
tion including a credit check. The landlord
may also charge a reasonable sublet fee even
when you provide the replacement tenants.
Normally you remain liable under your lease
if the replacement tenants do not pay rent or
damage the apartment. Some landlords will
release you from the obligations of your lease.
If you are being released, get it in writing.Can I Just Move Out and Forfeit
My Security Deposit?
No. Some tenants will walk out on a lease
and receive no adverse action, while others
will be pursued to the fullest extent of the
law. In Gainesville's current rental market,
the odds are that you will be sued unless you
supply acceptable replacement tenants.
Your losses in court will not be limited to
your security deposit, but will include rent
for each month the apartment remains vacant
during the term of your lease, plus court costs
and the landlord's attorney's fees.

607 352.335.2000Gainesville has plenty of off-campus housing including apartments, condos, houses, and rooms for rent. Take your time O C Lwhen looking for a place to live. There is plenty of available off- campus housing; don't rush to sign a lease. Even though prop-
erty managers/owners may say space is limited, chances are there are many vacant properties still available. UNVERTY OF FLORDA
Below is a Top 10 Checklist for finding the right place for you:
1. Use the Off Campus Housing Locator Service at http://housing.offcampus.ufl.edu.
2. Create a priority list. What do you care about most in a living space? Room size, rent, type of lease, type of community (large un-
dergrad population, graduate students, local residents, etc.), location, proximity to campus or bus route. all these things are factors to
consider in choosing a place to live. Write out a list of ideal characteristics you want in your future living space and keep these criteria
in mind when selecting a location.
3. Choose a well-suited roommate or choose to live alone. Know what kind of person would best compliment your personality and
choose accordingly.
4. Know your budget and choose a property that allows you to live within your means.
5. Drive around and visit the place and neighborhood you are looking to live in. Do not sign without seeing the property first. Pictures
can be very deceiving.
6. Take a tour of the complexes that interest you and get to know the management. Feel out the vibes the complex managers or staff
give you. These are the people responsible for taking care of the property, so if you feel like they take care of you, chances are they
also take care of the property. The same goes for the contrary.
7. Ask your friends for advice on where to live. Which properties worked well for them? Which didn't?
8. Check with local Law Enforcement for crime statistics on the area you choose to live in by calling 352-955-1818.
9. Go back to the property at night and make some observations. Is it well lit, do you see the security guard that management prom-
ised, is the security gate working, is it quiet enough to study, how close is the bus stop or parking to the complex or house, etc.?
10. Overall, listen to your heart. If you have any reservations about a property, do not feel forced to commit. There are plenty of living
places in Gainesville. You will find a place even if you let one property go.

Leases
A great University of Florida resource
available to full-time students is Student
Legal Services. For any questions on your
lease, contact Student Legal Services
and set up an appointment with a lawyer
to help review it BEFORE you sign it. Visit
www.studentlegaservices.ufl.edu or call
352-392-LAWS for more information.
Roommates
-Look for roommates on the Off Cam-
pus Housing Locator at: http://housing.
offcampus.ufl.edu.
-Being friends with someone and liv-
ing with a friend can be two totally dif-
ferent things. See the Gator Guide to Off
Campus Life for some tips on how to stay
friends while living together at www.off-
campus.ufl.edu/gatorguide.php
Safety Tips
Both personal and property safety is
important as you search for off-campus
housing. Before signing a lease, contact
local law enforcement at 352-955-1818
with the addresses of where you are
looking to live and they can give you
crime statistics for that area.
Below are five tips to use when looking
at safety during your apartment search:
1. Go back to the complex at night.
How do you feel? How does the envi-
ronment seem? Is the place well lit and
populated or dark and isolated?
2. Does the property have working se-
curity gates and/or guards?
3. Check for dead bolts on the out-
side door, locks for individual doors,alarm systems, etc. and ask lots of ques-
tions about the security. Is there an extra
charge for a security system?
4. Has there been crime in the area
recently? What actions have been done
to prevent crime from happening?
5. Don't forget about purchasing
some Renter's Insurance to protect you
and your stuff from the unexpected.
Go to the Off Campus Life website at
www.offcampus.ufl.edu/toplO.php for
more personal and property safety tips.
Budgets
You can't find the right place to live
until you know how much you are able
to spend. Here are some budget ques-
tions you should think about while tour-
ing a property:
1. What is the monthly rent?
2. What's included in that rent? Utili-
ties, gas, water, cable, internet?
3. What's not included in rent? What
is the average monthly cost for gas, elec-
tric, water, garbage disposal? If manage-
ment doesn't know, contact GRU at www.
gru.com and they can give you average
costs of utilities for the previous year.
4. Want to have a pet? Factor in the
deposit and monthly cost for food, medi-
cal, and grooming care.
5. Don't forget the insurance. Before you
sign your lease, call your insurance compa-
ny and see how much itwill cost monthly to
insure your apartment or house.
6. Are you going to need fuel for your
vehicle or are you going to use the bus?
Factor in transportation/ car mainte-
nance costs to your budget.
7. How much will you spend monthlyon groceries or on a meal plan?
8. Have some fun! Don't spend so
much on rent that you don't have mon-
ey for leisure time.
9. What do you spend on clothing,
shoes, and accessories?
10. How much money can you save ev-
ery month? It's really good to save some
money every month to cover unexpected
emergency expenses. Even $20 a month
saved is good. Every little bit counts.
To help you with your budget, OCL
has a budget spreadsheet in the Gator
Guide that can be found online at www.
offcampus.ufl.edu.
Insurance
If you are thinking about renting a
house or apartment, Renters Insurance
provides important coverage for both you
and your possessions. A standard Renter's
Policy protects your personal property in
case of theft or damage and may pay
for temporary living expenses if your rental
is damaged (including loss of use). It can
also shield you from personal liability. Any-
one who leases a house or apartment
should consider this type of coverage.
Talk with your parents before getting
your own renter's policy. If you are still
financially dependent on your parents or
a family member and they own a home,
they might be able to cover you under
their homeowner's policy. Some home-
owner policies will cover a dependent's
rental property while in college.
There are several types of Residential
Insurance policies. Read your policy in-
formation carefully and ensure you have
full coverage. Policies should include theSPECIAL ADVERTISING SECTION

Explosion; Aircraft; Vehicles; Smoke;

Damage by glass or safety-glazing ma-
terial that is part of a building; Falling ob-
jects; Water-related damage from home
utilities; Electrical surge damage
Floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes
aren't on the list. If you live in an area
prone to one or more of the three, you'll
need to buy a separate policy or a rid-
er. In areas where hurricanes can pose
a threat, you might also need to buy a
separate rider to cover wind damage.
Ask your insurance agent about this ex-
tra coverage. Gainesville is prone to
hurricanes and some areas flood.
Your living environment plays a ma-
jor factor in your overall happiness level.
Know what you want to get out of your
living space and choose your location
and roommate(s) accordingly. Don't let
anyone else push you into living some-

100% right with. Gainesville is home
now. .so let Off Campus Life help you
get the most out of your off-campus ex-
perience.

Cunningham, Dunlap coming on strong
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator org
It took a while, but Florida's
highly touted defensive ends are
starting to make their presence
felt.
Through the first five games
this season, Carlos Dunlap and
Jermaine Cunningham had com-
bined for just three sacks, a to-
tal linebacker Brandon Spikes
equaled in the LSU game alone.
"Those two guys off the
edge right now are playing
about as well as any pair of
defensive ends in college
football."
Dan McCarney
UF defensive line coach
They flashed little of the tal-
ent and drive that made ESPN's
Scouts, Inc. rate them the Nos. 1
and 8 defensive end prospects for
April's NFL Draft.
But they've recovered from the
slow start, racking up four each in
the last three contests.
That's the kind of production
that was expected from the duo at
the beginning of the season, and if

UF takes different mindset to SEC Tourney
Gators will face Vols in first round
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligatororg
Hospitality is overrated.
When Tennessee (8-8-3, 4-5-2 Southeast-
ern Conference) faces No. 8 Florida (14-4-2,
8-1-2 SEC) in the opening round of the SEC
Tournament tonight at 6 in Orange Beach,
Ala., the Volunteers might find the Gators
backline to be less inviting than the last
time the two teams met.
When UF traveled to Tennessee on Oct
16, the Gators blew an early 1-0 lead after
defender Lauren Hyde had the ball stripped
by Volunteers forward Chelsea Hatcher in
the Gators' defensive third.
Hatcher easily scored, Tennessee put
another goal on the scoreboard and Florida
needed a goal in the last five minutes to es-
cape with a tie."Tennessee kicked our butts last time,"
coach Becky Burleigh said.
When the Gators returned to Gainesville
after the match, Burleigh changed the way
the team practiced to emphasize defense.
"We're a high-risk team," Burleigh said.
"We like to play offense. We
play defense because we have
to -that's just our philoso-
phy. And so we were rely-Soccer ing a little bit too much on
our offense and not spending
enough time coaching the defense."
The coaches put players through a one-
on-one drill to help them focus on pressur-
ing opponents when they are the first to
mark an attacking player. The idea is for
one player to step up and cut off the oppo-
nent's options.
"One-on-one defending is crucial be-
cause if you mess up, then that messes upthe whole team," sophomore Sarah Chap-
man said.
The Gators also practice a half-field drill,
where forwards and attacking midfielders
approach UF defenders and try to score.
Defensive midfielders usually play along-
side the backline, but Burleigh sometimes
tells them to play behind the attack to prac-
tice defending a counter attack.
If the defensive midfielders are tracking
back, the backline focuses on containing the
attack as much as possible until the mid-
fielders can arrive to help.
During the drill, coaches will stop play
when they see the need to instruct defend-
ers on how to react based on the way the
offense runs into the penalty box.
By focusing on defense in practice, the
Gators not only improved tactically, they
also changed their mentality, Burleigh said.
The coach wants every player, attacking
players included, to be involved.

UF WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Gators not sure of this year's offensive identity
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@a Iligator org
Some days Amanda Butler thinks
her team will be a run-and-gun type
offense. Other times after practice,
she's not so sure the UF women's
basketball team will be as outside-
oriented as she previously thought.
She may be indecisive about the
offensive image of her team, but
Butler is sure about two things: her
team can shoot, and she's going to
make sure the Gators pound the
paint this season.
"We've got the potential to put
five kids on the floor that can shoot
the three," Butler said. "Does that
mean that we're going to live and
die by the three? Absolutely not."Last season, the UF women's bas-
ketball team averaged nearly two
more 3 pointers than its opponents.
The team also shot .365 from
downtown -as opposed to the .310
percentage opponents fired.
And while the team is comprised
of shooters, Butler listed some of the
shooters on her team from memory
like reading from a list: Jordan Jones,
Jennifer Mossor, Steffi Sorensen and
post players Sharielle Smith and Lily
Svete.
"We're great shooters, but we
have to punish (opponents) in the
paint so that they have to worry,"
Azania Stewart said.
UF may just be able to shoot from
beyond the arc all night and day, but
the team plans to stick to defense
and post play.Butler has made it clear she's
not afraid to tell her shooters when
they're trigger happy. But they're
not yet. She made that known from
the beginning.
"We've got the potential to
put five kids on the floor
that can shoot the three."
Amanda Butler
UF women's basketball coach
The Gators will go to the rim first
-running until they're stopped -
before going to the 3-point line.
"Sometimes they don't hit
(threes) all the time, so we do have
to go and rebound," sophomore
Trumae Lucas said. "We have to
pick those points back up that theydon't knock down from behind the
arc."
The offense will undoubtedly
take a different look with the depar-
ture of superstar seniors Marshae
Dotson and Sha Brooks, the team's
two leading scorers last year with
16.4 and 14 points per game, respec-
tively.
This may raise red flags for out-
siders, but Butler points out how she
and her coaching staff have known
since their arrival that the duo was
were bound to leave.
"There's a lot of different people
that are going to assume bigger roles
because there's not a Marshae Dot-
son and a Sha Brooks any longer,"
Butler said.
Even without the unmistakable
offensive production the pairingbrought, Butler is still preaching of-
fensive aggressiveness.
Ndidi Madu, who has been sin-
gled out by the coaching staff for her
higher level of play in the preseason,
said being assertive was one of the
most pivotal things she learned from
Dotson last year.
Madu said she's been working
on being more aggressive in the
paint and working on her low-block
scoring. A player who likes to face
the basket, Madu is striving to score
in other ways.
But she, like the other post play-
ers, feels completely confident about
kicking it out if she doesn't have a
shot.
"I never have a doubt, if I'm kick-
ing it out -it's automatic, it's going
in," Stewart said.
Florida tied for conference lead in sacks
FOOTBALL, from page 22
it keeps up, an already stout UF defense will be even bet-
ter.
"Those two guys off the edge right now are playing
about as well as any pair of defensive ends in college foot-
ball," defensive line coach Dan McCarney said. "They need
to continue that. They haven't been doing that all year. In
the last two or three weeks, I think they have been."
Following the LSU game, the Gators were 34th in the
nation for sacks, but they've risen to No. 14 and are now
tied for the Southeastern Conference lead with Alabama
and Ole Miss at 23.
McCarney said they should have "at least six more," and
he's hopeful his unit can add to that tally after regaining
some depth on the interior line.
Entering the season, Lawrence Marsh and Jaye Howard
were the expected starters at defensive tackle, but injuries
have limited Marsh to action in just three games, and How-
ard has missed two of the last three.
That left Omar Hunter, Terron Sanders and Troy Epps
inside, but Epps hasn't seen action in the last four games.
"A couple of games you're just holding your breath, tell-
ing them, 'Here's what you have to do, here's what we haveto do to win, and don't get hurt,' McCarney said "That's a
great message from your position coach, 'Don't get hurt.' It
was about time for me to go into the game."
The lack of depth didn't allow McCarney to use the kind
of rotation he had envisioned to keep his players fresh, and
the pass rush suffered.
Justin Trattou played at both end and tackle, and after
recovering from a biceps injury, he and the
now-healthy Howard and Marsh should
change things inside.
"Overall, they're doing a good job, but theFootball challenge is we have to get more out of those
inside guys," he said. "There's not going to
be five sacks a game by the inside guys, but there has to be
lots of pressure."
The increased performance from Dunlap and Cunning-
ham has coincided with a rise in interceptions. The Gators
have tallied seven of their 14 picks in the last two games,
and being able to rely on the front four to get to the quarter-
back makes life easier for the rest of the defense.
"That helps us out tremendously," cornerback Joe Ha-
den said. "As a matter of fact, sometimes it's not even about
the coverage. Say we have OK coverage, but the pass is a
little off because of the pass rush, that makes playing corner
a whole lot easier."
Change in focus leads to three straight shutouts
SOCCER, from page 22
"If you have a player that gets past
you, then you have a responsibility
to get back and help track that player
down, and not just say, 'Oh, it's not
my problem anymore, I'll let her deal
with it,"' Burleigh said.
The change in attitude has been ob-
vious on the pitch. In UF's three games
since the team changed its focus, the
Gators have recorded three shutouts.
Even more telling, in games to de-
termine the SEC regular season cham-
pionship against No. 13 LSU and No.
15 South Carolina, Florida prevented
its opponents from getting an open
look at the goal.
Anytime a player had room to
breathe, she quickly noticed a Gators
jersey attached to her.
"In the back of our mind, when we
lose the ball, we have to get it back,"
Chapman said.
Back to Tennessee's side of the field
but not back to Florida's welcoming
ways.BOBBY, from page 22
part of Meyer's plan to fix some of the offensive
problems the team has had in recent weeks.
"We didn't audible a lot, we let them play,"
Meyer said.
The Banzai package probably will linger for
the rest of the season and Meyer will try to fix
it in the offseason, but it is not going to be the
prevalent fixture in the offense as once expect-
ed.
The Joker package falls into the same cat-
egory.
The 3-3-5 defense was supposed to take
advantage of the Gators' three great defensive
ends (Carlos Dunlap, Jermaine Cunningham
and Justin Trattou), the army of quality line-
backers and the three "starting" safeties (Will
Hill, Ahmad Black and Major Wright).
Although defensive coordinator Charlie
Strong knew it would be susceptible against the
run, it was going to be effective against pass-
heavy teams and on third-and-long situations.
The only problem is that on third and long,
teams are usually unwilling to just heave the
ball down the field and instead opt to run or
throw screens.
Tennessee was the first to take advantage of
this formation, breaking off runs of 20 and 13 on
third and long and added a 21-yard screen play
on another one.
Since then, the Joker has made only occa-
sionally appearances in third-and-long situa-
tions, and the Gators have made an increased
push to add depth at defensive tackle, so they
could play more four-man fronts, despite being
plagued by injuries at the position.
If Strong wants to get Trattou and Hill, who
are both the third man at their position, on the
field, he is just going to have to rotate them in
because the joker is barely a viable option.
Just because these two wrinkles have failed
that doesn't mean Meyer or Strong have lost
their touch. Meyer's past additions have had
success and are now staples in the offense, and
Strong is directing the nation's best defense.
The Banzai's failure has not kept Meyer
down either, because he has already unveiled a
new candidate to be added to the offense.
In the last two games, he has added the I-for-
mation to the game plan with much success, but
before anyone goes claiming the I-form is here
to stay, just wait because a couple more games
could expose this too as a fraud. Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF midfielder Sarah Chapman (88) and her teammates have put more em-
phasis on defense recently. It has paid off with six wins in seven matches.

Frontcourt struggles against undersized exhibition foe
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
As impressive as the Gators' guards were in their
first exhibition game Monday night, Florida's front-
court play left a little something to be desired.
Praised as being the team's deeper and more ver-
satile unit, UF's big men were mostly outplayed and
overshadowed by a two-deep backcourt that fea-
tures four underclassmen despite facing a team that
started no player taller than 6 foot 7.
UF gave up 11 offensive rebounds to an under-
sized Saint Leo squad in the first half of the 95-46
exhibition victory against the Lions. Although the
Gators went on to win the rebounding advantage 51-
38, they trailed by one about two minutes into the
second half.
UF coach Billy Donovan attributed some of his
team's early rebounding struggles to his experi-
menting with a number of different rotations in his
team's full-court press. In addition, the Lions missed
20 threes in the game, which resulted in a lot of long
rebounds.
"We weren't boxing out," said junior power for-
ward Alex Tyus, who led the team with nine boards.
"They were shooting a lot of threes. We were just
running in without touching our men, and the ball
would go over our heads."
Tyus started the game at power forward, where
he will likely see the bulk of his minutes after hav-
ing to play out of position at center all last season.
The preseason All-Southeastern Conference Second
Team selection was also the team's only non-back-
court player to score double-digit points, finishing
with 10.
Center Vernon Macklin struggled at times in his
highly anticipated Florida debut, scoring 7 points,
grabbing just four rebounds and recording no blocks
in 23 minutes.Macklin has been viewed as the solution to UF's
low-post issues from last year, as his 6-foot-10,
240-pound frame gives the Gators a legitimate big
man and frees up players like Tyus and Dan Werner
to return to their more natural positions, as they did
Monday night.
The junior said he didn't feel any pressure in his
first game back after sitting out all last season, but
he didn't look or feel entirely comfortable in his first
organized game in more than a year.
"I'm sure for him it was a little bit of an awkward
feeling, going out there in the starting lineup," said
Donovan, who has repeatedly warned against ex-
pecting too much out of Macklin. "Probably the last
time he started a game was in high school. But I think
Vern will continue to get better."
"They were shooting a lot of threes. We
were just running in without touching
our men, and the ball would go over our
heads."

UF junior power forward
Coming off the bench to fill in at center and power
forward, freshman Erik Murphy showed the poten-
tial to be a key role player for the Gators. He put up
nine points and grabbed six boards while appearing
to already be one of UF's most physical, athletic re-
bounders.
Sophomore Kenny Kadji also saw time at center,
adding six points, five rebounds and a team-high
three blocks, but he racked up four fouls and three
turnovers in only 14 minutes of play.
"If you look at Kadji, Murphy and Macklin as a
committee, in terms of their points, rebounds and
what they did, I thought it was pretty good," Dono-
van said.UF center Vernon Macklin had seven points, four rebounds and no
blocks in 23 minutes against Division-Il Saint Leo on Monday.
