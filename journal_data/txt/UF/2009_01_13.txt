The chant “am Israel chi” 
filled the air as about 100 peo-
ple marched down University 
Avenue on Monday.
Their chant, which means, 
“The nation of Israel lives,” rang out as the rally continued down 
University Avenue, starting at 
Ben Hill Griffin Stadium and end-ing at the Bo Diddley Community Plaza. 
Participants waved signs while 
they walked, which read “We Stand with Israel” and “Israel wants Peace,” only to encounter another protest demanding peace 
on both sides. 
Sandy Baum, a UF English se-
nior, helped organize the march 
alongside the Lubavitch-Chabad 
Jewish Student and Community 
Center. 
“I thought, we need to do 
something now,” she said. “We wanted Gainesville to stand up for Israel.”
Baum said they marched in 
support for Israel and to stand up 
for those who were affected by 
the attacks by Hamas.
UF biological engineering se-
nior Lee Ravid said the attacks 
hit close to home.  
Ravid was born in Israel but 
has attended UF for the past

Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan will make her 
annual State of the City address Wednesday at 8 a.m. in front of the Hippodrome State Theatre.The speech will give a summary of the 
city’s growth over the past year and discuss plans for a successful future, according to a City of Gainesville news release. 
One of the major issues Mayor Hanrahan 
will touch on is the receding economy’s effect on Gainesville, said Bob Woods, Gainesville’s communications and market-ing director. 
With the Florida Legislature making 
drastic budget cuts, the mayor is anticipat-ing budget shortfalls for the city, he said. 
City Manager Russ 
Blackburn is working on a budget plan and asking 
different city departments 
to find programs and ser -
vices that can be cut in or -
der to relieve budget ten-sion. 
This upcoming fiscal 
year is the third year in a row that the city manager has had to schedule cuts. 
A meeting is scheduled next month for 
Blackburn to present a budget plan to the mayor and the rest of the Gainesville City 
Commission.  
Despite budget problems and the slack-
ing economy, the city has many accomplish-
ments, which Hanrahan will highlight dur -
ing her speech, Woods said. 
“There is still much to be excited about in 
Gainesville,” he said.Mayor Hanrahan to make State of the City addressSEE PROTEST, PAGE 8

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — The state insurance com-
missioner Monday again denied State Farm Florida’s pro-
posed average 47.1 percent rate increase for homeowner coverage against hurricanes and other property losses.
Commissioner Kevin McCarty previously denied the 
increase but State Farm, Florida’s second-largest property insurer, appealed. An administrative law judge also de-nied the increase last month, sending the matter back to McCarty.
State Farm Insurance Co. now has 30 days to take the 
case to the 1st District Court of Appeal.n To see a

 MORE THAN $90,000 HAS BEEN 
SAVED SINCE OCTOBER 2007.
Jail inmates in Alachua County saved local 
taxpayers more than $4,000 in December.
Instead of hiring companies to provide 
handiwork services around the county, the inmates worked 340 hours and saved the 
county $4,450.60.
From January through November, the 
inmate squads performed 6,038 hours of labor saving a total amount of $79,037.42 
in tax dollars for those months, according 
to a news release from the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office.
Since the inmate projects began in October 
of 2007, the county has saved a total $92,356.50.
In December the in-
mates cut trees and brush 
and removed debris at the Gainesville Regional Airport.
They also painted and cleaned the in-
mate holding area in the Criminal Justice Courthouse, cleaned the firing ranges and removed debris from the Santa Fe College 
Institute for Public Safety.

UF has another title to add to its 
heap.
Florida drivers bought 113,562 
specialty license plates in 2008, top-
ping sales for any other plate type. 
UF trounced the other Florida 
colleges and universities in specialty plate sales. Florida State University finished second in school sales and fifth overall with 75,707. FSU was 
followed by Miami with 29,355 and 
Florida A&M with 20,961. According to the Florida 
Department of Highway Safety and 
Motor Vehicles, this was the third 
straight year UF led in statewide specialty license plate sales. In 2007, the university sold 105,361, and in 
2006, it sold 90,436.
“I think that the success of the 
athletic programs, (has increased 
plate sales) as well as the state-wide interest in the university,” 
said Courtney Heidelberg, deputy 
director of communications at the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.Specialty plates are available for 
an extra $27 at Florida tax collec-
tors’ offices. 
“Twenty-five dollars of that 
is the specialty plate fee which 
goes to the University of Florida,” Heidelberg said, “and the other two dollars is a processing fee that goes 
back to the state.”
The state of Florida collects li-
cense plate fees, and the money is 
later distributed to the charity or 
university for which the plate was 
bought. 
A UF foundation called The 
Florida Fund decides how the li-cense plate money is spent. 
“It does not go to any particu-
lar department,” said Nina Kaharl, spokeswoman for the fund.
The university’s promotional ef-forts may also contribute to its con-sistent leading sales.
Kaharl said UF sends birthday 
postcards to alumni reminding them that it’s time to renew their plate and suggesting that they con-
sider a UF plate.
“I think our alumni are very 
loyal to their institution. This is one 
more way they can show their loy-alty,” Kaharl said.
Following the UF tag, the 
“Protect the Wild Dolphins” spe-cialty plate was second in 2008 sales. It sold 80,797. UF trounces Florida colleges in specialty plate salesAroundGainesville

When Bobby and Sarah 
Finn discussed the all-impor -
tant topic of having children, 
they decided they wanted to adopt.
To learn more about foster 
care and adopting, the couple attended the Children’s Home Society’s adoption orientation on Monday night in down-town Gainesville.
There are a lot of children 
that don’t have a good home and deserve one, Bobby Finn 
said.
Although Children’s Home 
Society handles international 
adoption, private adoption and foster care, the mid-Flor -
ida division, which includes Alachua County, only pro-vides foster care adoption ser -
vices.Six people attended the 
meeting led by dependency specialist Amy Mills.
Mills said the orientation is 
the first step in becoming an adoptive parent. After orien-tation, families must complete a pre-service training class 
and participate in a home study before being approved and 
matched with a child.
Last year, 187 children were 
adopted in the mid-Florida di-vision.
Jennifer Anchors, an ex-
ecutive director of the mid-Florida division, said that while 150 to 200 children are adopted per year on average, more children are entering the system.
Anchors said the rise is a 
result of multiple factors, in-cluding the economy.When people are struggling 
financially and do not proper -
ly know how to cope, children are more often abused and ne-glected, she said.
Mills said she expects the 
numbers to continue to in-crease.
Although people may face 
more financial obstacles, more families are looking to adopt, said Anchors.
She said the growth is due 
to enhanced public knowl-edge on adoption and expects the boost to continue. For ex-ample, the belief is being dis-
pelled that all forms of adop-
tion are expensive.
Although private and in-
ternational adoption are cost-ly, Mills said that foster care adoption doesn’t cost any-thing.
The state covers the ex-
penses, Mills said. Meeting dispels myths 
about adoption process SALMONELLA LINKED TO 
TAINTED PEANUT BUTTER.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MINNEAPOLIS — The salmo-
nella bacteria that has sickened 
more than 400 people in 43 states 
has been conclusively linked to 
peanut butter, Minnesota health of-
ficials announced Monday.
Federal officials said the outbreak 
may have contributed to three deaths.  
State health and agriculture officials said last week they had found sal-
monella bacteria in a 5-pound pack-age of King Nut peanut butter at a 
nursing facility in Minnesota.
Officials tested the bacteria over 
the weekend and found a genetic 
match with the bacterial strain that has led to 30 illnesses in Minnesota and others across the country.
“The commonality among all of our patients was that they ate peanut butter,” said Doug Schultz, 
a spokesman with the Minnesota 
Department of Health.
While the brand of peanut butter 
couldn’t be confirmed in every case, 
the majority of patients consumed 
the same brand, he said Monday.
The peanut butter was distrib-
uted only through food service pro-viders and was not sold directly to consumers. Officials are concerned 
the peanut butter is still being used, 
and Kassenborg urged institutions 
to toss it out.
A woman in her 70s at a northern 
Minnesota nursing home died after contracting salmonella, although 
epidemiologist Stephanie Meyer of 
the state Health Department said it 
wasn’t clear whether the illness or 
underlying health problems caused 
the death. The woman was not at 
the facility where the bacteria was 
initially found.Outbreak source found

tHE aSSoCiatED PRESS
WASHINGTON — With rare 
public emotion, George W. Bush 
sat in judgment on his controver -
sial, consequential presidency on Monday, lamenting mistakes but 
claiming few as his own, heatedly 
defending his record on disasters in Iraq and at home and offering kindly advice to a successor who won largely because the nation ached for something new.
By turns wistful, aggressive and 
joking in his final news conference, Bush covered a huge range of top-
ics in summing up his eight years 
in the White House — the latest in a recent string of efforts to have his say before historians have theirs. Then the White House said he would do it again Thursday night in a final address to the nation.
Reaching back to his first day in 
office, he recalled walking into the 
White House and having “a mo-
ment” when he felt all the respon-sibilities of the job landing on his shoulders. Barack Obama will feel that next week, he said, his tone gently understanding.
He was full of supportive words 
for Obama — the nation’s first black president — and talked of being deeply affected while watch-ing people say on television that they never thought they would see the day, many with “tears stream-
ing down their cheeks when they 
said it.”
“President-elect Obama’s elec-
tion does speak volumes about how far this country has come when it comes to racial relations,” Bush said, seeming almost awe-struck.
He brushed off any suggestion 
that he’d found the job of president too burdensome — or that Obama would find it so. “It’s just pathetic, isn’t it, self-pity?” he said. “And I don’t believe that President-elect Obama will be full of self-pity.”
At the same time, Bush showed 
his skin is not so thick as all that. “Sometimes the biggest disap-
pointments will come from your 
so-called friends,” he advised Obama. Bush’s former press sec-retary, Scott McClellan, released a scathing tell-all book last year that still stings around the West Wing.
Asked one last time by report-
ers about the major controversies of his presidency, Bush had a ready answer for each:
— On the dismal economy he 
leaves behind for Obama, Bush 
said, “I inher -
ited a recession, I’m ending on a recession. In the meantime, there were 52 months of uninterrupted 
job growth.” The 
2001 recession began in March, 
two months into his presidency, but economists agree the seeds were sown long before.
Bush also defended himself 
against economic attacks from his own party on the huge govern-ment bailout of Wall Street finan-
cial firms. He said, his voice ris-
ing, “If you were sitting there and heard that the depression could be greater than the Great Depression, I hope you would act, too, which I did.”
— On the five-year-old Iraq 
war, the issue that will define his presidency, Bush said history will judge his actions but it is a fact that violence diminished and everyday 
life became more stable after his 
decision in 2007 to send an addi-tional 30,000 American troops into the fight.
— He vigorously took issue 
with critics of the federal response to Katrina, the hurricane that dev-astated New Orleans. Gesturing and speaking with feeling, he said, 
“Don’t tell me the federal response 
was slow when there were 30,000 people pulled off roofs right after the storm passed,” he said. “Has the reconstruction been perfect? No. Have things happened fairly quickly? Absolutely.”
— The president claimed prog-
ress toward peace in the Middle 
East, though any hopes for an ac-
cord soon have been dashed by, among other things, a bruising of-fensive by Israel in the Gaza Strip.
— Most angrily, Bush dismissed 
“some of the elite” who say he has damaged America’s image around the world. “No question, parts of Europe have said that we shouldn’t have gone to war in Iraq without a mandate, but those are few coun-
tries,” he said.
The president’s actions after the 
Sept. 11 attacks — such as estab-
lishing the prison for suspected ter -
rorists at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, approving tough interrogation methods that some say amount to torture and instituting infor -
mation-gathering efforts at home 
decried by civil rights groups — 
were compounded by global out-rage at the 2003 invasion of Iraq, particularly later when the alleged weapons of mass destruction that were the main justification for war turned out not to exist.
“In terms of the decisions that I 
had made to protect the homeland, 
I wouldn’t worry about popular -
ity,” he said.

BCS gear shouldn’t cost 
us limbs we can’t spare
When you’re a Gator, you can almost always bet on Christmas coming twice a year.
Reaching the pinnacle of the college football 
world means championship rings for the team, a spectacu-lar new trophy for UF — not to mention a smörgsabord of 
memorabilia to the delight of loyal fans.
The stores in town? 
Let’s just say their eyeballs have been replaced with dollar 
signs for the next couple weeks as hordes of faithful Gators 
look to upgrade their wardrobes and collect anything and 
everything from a flag for the car to the ever-popular shot 
glass.
We think it’s safe to assume if the Gators had ended the 
season on a more Auburn-esque note, fans wouldn’t exactly be diving under couch pillows for an extra 25 cents to snag a 
set of championship golf balls.
The Editorial Board supports the local merchants in their 
efforts to grab a slice of the BCS pie. Heck, don’t be surprised 
when you see us walking around campus decked out from head to toe in the freshest of championship gear.
All we ask is that the stores in and around Gainesville re-
frain from exploiting the not-so-deep pockets of The Gator Nation. Sure, we know that you have to “get yours” too, but we caution you to expect a follow-up editorial if word on the 
street is T-shirt prices have hit 30 bucks a pop.
There’s nothing wrong with padding the bank account a 
little bit and clearing some inventory — just don’t get greedy 
and end up taking our wallets for a whirl.
While Somali gunboats and high-seas kidnap-
pings have once again moved the most visible pirates back out into the open ocean, the piracy 
of copyrighted information remains one of the main grass-roots responses to the flows of data products deemed le-gitimate by the controlling global corporate structure. 
Unlike that burned Lil Wayne CD you play much too 
loudly in mom’s old sedan, actual pirates are once again disrupting the global supply chain for the first time in a couple hundred years. 
Old-school pirates once again dominate the headlines, 
and thus far 2009 has undoubtedly been the “Year of the Pirate.” This week alone, a $3 million ransom parachuted down to complete the release of the Saudi supertanker Sirius Star and a dead pirate washed ashore with $153,000 
in soaked U.S. currency have vividly completed the saga 
of the most daring and ambitious act of piracy in mod-ern history.  These North African pirates represent a clean break from the romanticized buccaneers who parlayed 
three movies into almost $3 billion in worldwide box-of-
fice receipts. The world embraced those scalawags with both arms, yet few in the media have approached actual working pirates with the same enthusiasm.  
Real pirates, like their egalitarian cinematic counter -
parts, still embrace themes of equality and freedom — any ransom paid to them is always split up evenly amongst the whole crew. That sopping wet $153,000 in the pocket of our unfortunate drowned pirate is currently being dried 
out by his family in central Somalia, where it will be put 
directly into the local economy one way or another. A re-port from BBC News states that this lone dead man was the only one of the pirates to have held on to his loot in the aftermath of the Sirius Star release. Since January 1991, Somalia has 
been without a functioning govern-ment. Eighteen years of crushing 
poverty and utter mayhem seems 
to have created the ultimate cru-
cible for the formation of a full-fledged cottage industry in the acquisition of seafaring salvation. Global corporations 
send 20,000 vessels a year past the Somali coastline, and 
the starving desperadoes raised in hell on earth should do what, exactly – wave serenely from the shoreline?
An editorial in the London Independent last week 
drew international fire for daring to suggest that these pi-rates were anything other than crazed subhuman maraud-ers. Johann Hari states that these Somalis certainly count a number of outright criminals amongst their ranks, but that 
the men we call pirates are actually functioning as the de 
facto Somali Coast Guard.  
European fishermen seeking to evade strict EU regu-
lations illegally take an estimated $300 million worth of 
fish from Somali waters each year. Quite a bit more sin-
ister is Hari’s accusation that European countries, using the well-known discounted disposal services of the Italian mafia, have been dumping huge amounts of nuclear and medical waste into unregulated Somali seas since the 1991 
collapse.     
Perhaps the truth of the matter behind these pirates is 
more difficult to ascertain than simply splitting the dis-
tance between Black Hawk Down and the Pirates of the 
Caribbean series. If so, I suspect most of us will simply go 
back to downloading that bootlegged copy of The Dark Knight.

The Editorial Board 
knows we aren’t per -
fect — look around 
hard enough and you’re bound to come across some 
minute error somewhere 
within our pages. But, un-like the outgoing president, 
when we admit our faults 
we would like to think we own up to them. Eight long 
years and you’re halfway 
there, George. 
If only you could’ve had 
your suits outfitted with a dry-erase board to constant-ly update the nation with a 
running list of corrections. 
We’ll be sure to bring up the idea again the next time 
a Republican takes office 
(don’t hold your breath).
At the very least our pro-
posal could launch a whole line of Dubya Halloween costumes a la Flavor Flav’s 
oversized hanging clock.
Dare we say post-presi-
dency pet project?The Editorial Board must 
admit a small smile crept upon our faces when, at 
your final news conference of your, cough, illustrious 
presidential career, you of-
fered the media a bit of truth about some of your deci-
sions.
We really do want to of-
fer you a heartfelt thanks for at least alluding to the fact 
that you are leaving office in the midst of a major reces-
sion. Nice touch admitting 
the lack of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was a 
“disappointment” and con-
ceding that giving a speech under a banner proclaiming 
“Mission Accomplished” 
was a bit of a misstep.
Did we forget anything?
George, don’t fault us for 
shedding a tear or two come

Letters to the Editor
BCS system breeds doubt
The BCS is a flawed system that 
has ruined the mystique of the bowls 
that existed before 1998.
Kyle Whittingham, head coach of 
the Utah Utes, would like to sched-
ule his team against “big” out-of-
conference opponents, but the only team that accepted the request this season was Michigan. 
They beat the team that was 
ranked at the top for most of the sea-son in Alabama, yet they received little to no respect from the media.
Out of the teams with one loss, 
Texas’ defeat came on the best play of the year, while UF’s was the worst occurring in the Swamp by a good, but still developing Mississippi team.The Atlantic Coast Conference 
was 6-6 against the Southeastern Conference this year and the Big East Conference had the best win-ning percentage of any league, even though these conferences are per -
ceived as weak.  There is parity in college football that the media con-
tinues to ignore.
UF’s only challenge for next sea-
son is LSU, as the team does not play 
Alabama or Mississippi during the regular season. 
They will not even play the next 
two best SEC teams until the SEC Championship Game.
Even in the plus-one system, 
some analysts left off Utah and in-stead placed Texas, USC, Oklahoma and UF. An eight-team playoff is the best 
way to remove the doubts.
Until we get that system, the na-
tional championship will continue to be judged by the media and com-puters rather than settled on the field.  Congratulations to the Gators on the win, but doubts will be at-
tached to that crystal ball.

Palestinian supporters not 
ignorant, should speak up
After reading a recent editorial 
on how Gainesville residents are ig-
norant about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I noticed that the the igno-rance was directed toward those 
that support Palestinians. 
In America, we are allowed 
free speech, and any attempt to si-
lence it is un-American. There are many reasons for people to support Palestinians and speak up about it. After all, the majority of the world finds the United States and Israel in the wrong.  Are they ignorant, too? 
I would love to see peace in the 
Middle East, but I do have some concerns with Israeli politics.
Long before this recent war, 
Israel imposed blockades, check-points, restrictions to humanitarian aid, settlement building, dividing walls, electricity shut-offs, etc., that have all created suffering and anger among many in the world, especial-ly Palestinians. This fuels constant 
retaliation. People in Gaza are caged 
in without an airport, port or other means to live a normal life. Even media coverage is restricted. 
Is this not enough to compare 
Israel to other oppressive regimes of the past and to protest? Why doesn’t Israel start helping these people instead of creating more enemies? 
How about helping build schools 
and hospitals or allowing import of goods?
This would show the people of 
the world that they want peace in-stead of continued occupation and oppression.

LuckyD0g21: So what are 
your plans for this weekend?  
SunshineGrl43: I’m gonna hang out 
with the girls and maybe go see Bride Wars.  
LuckyD0g21: You think you can squeeze me 
in for a date?
No matter how it’s phrased or what online 
method is used, it’s becoming more common 
for guys to ask girls out online. 
I can’t help but wonder why.  My friends suggested shyness, a desire to 
speed up the relationship or maybe just the opportunity presenting itself. Though these are all critical, I think the real core issue is re-
jection. That, I think, is the harsh reality that 
makes guys use the online method when ask-ing girls out. 
They can ask for a date and if the answer is 
no, well, it wasn’t said to their face, so they’ve saved their ego.  How convenient. Since when did rejection become so avoid-
able?  
Rejection is something we should face, 
I believe, fairly frequently. Rejection will make you tougher and make you work for 
the things you really want. If there’s someone 
you wish to spend time with, no amount of rejection will stop you from getting what you want. 
Aside from the obvious, experiencing 
rejection will influence how you reject oth-ers. My personal experience with rejection, though sometimes painful, has proved ben-eficial. 
When I was placed in the position to re-
fuse an applicant for hire, I did it gently and gave her another option, pointing her across the street to another place that was hiring. Who knows — maybe I pushed her through the door that was supposed to be opened by my rejection of her application.
Avoiding rejec-
tion and placing buf-
fers around you to prevent rejection is, quite 
frankly, weak. Rejection and all the other 
pains of life make you stronger, so avoiding them is your undoing. Knowing this, I won’t accept a proposal for a date when asked on-line. 
Ask me in person, or ask me over the 
phone and put yourself out there. Show me your courage; show me you’re willing to face rejection to get what you really want. 
I’m not saying that asking a girl out in per -
son or over the phone where you’re more vul-nerable will secure your chances of scoring a date. Nope, I can’t guarantee that. However, it will make us respect you. It reminds us what you’re putting on the line to ask us out: yourself. It also reminds us ladies that we can’t just CTRL+ALT+DEL the conversation like nothing happened. 
No, if we turn your offer down we need 
to do it gracefully and nicely because we are 
dealing with a person and not some vague 
online identity. Conversing and dealing with people in person is tough on both parties, but we haven’t reached a point in our lives where we strictly deal with people online. We still have to master face-to-face interaction with people, which means we need to practice it. 
So put down your BlackBerry or iPhone 
and say hello to the person next to you – es-
pecially if it’s a person you’re interested in. 
And instead of asking them for their e-mail address, I suggest starting with, “You wanna get some coffee?”

Speaking Out8, ALLIGATOR  TUESDAY, JANUARY 13, 2009
By MORGAN COLLINS
Alligator Contributing Writer
The recent BCS National 
Championship boosted demand 
for Gator fan-ware, but some 
stores said business isn’t as good as it was  after past title wins. 
Taryn Emswiler, 23, the gen-
eral merchandise manager at the 
Florida Bookstore on University 
Avenue, said sales should pick up within a few days and keep steady for several months as UF 
alumni and other fans trickle into Gainesville.
But so far, the rush has been 
smaller than former champion-
ships.
“Last time, we couldn’t get 
around the store with all of the people inside,” she said.
David Bushnell, 55, owner of 
Gator Fever I in Butler Plaza, said 
there have been less T-shirt sales 
this year compared with the 2006 football championship. 
When UF played Ohio State, 
it hadn’t won a football champi-onship game in 10 years and was cast as the game’s underdog.
“We wanted to win,” Bushnell 
said. “We just didn’t expect it.”
A number of different circum-
stances affect the amount of shirts sold, he said.
The weak econ-
omy has left people 
with less money to spend, and the location of the championship game also factored into the de-cline.
Since the game was held in 
Miami, a lot of people are still out of town and haven’t yet returned to buy Gator gear, Bushnell said.
“If I was a college student, 
and the game was in a town with 
a beach, would I come back?” he 
said.
Also, the 2006 and the 2008 
championships had different cir -
cumstances surrounding them. 
For example, after the 2006 
championship, media hype spec-ulating back-to-back champion-ships for the basketball team 
crossed over into football, driv-
ing T-shirt sales up.Still, the Florida Bookstore 
and Gator Fever I have sold lots of championship gear, and sales have been up since Thursday’s game. 
At Gator Fever I, a bestseller is 
the “Promise Kept” T-shirt, with Tim Tebow’s complete, emotional promise of dedication after UF’s 
loss to Mississippi, Bushnell 
said.
The store received two orders 
of nearly 1,500 of the shirts over the weekend. As of Monday, only 
a couple hundred were left.
“It was a great, great game,” 
he said. “Hopefully, there will be 
another.”Gator gear sales low compared to previous title win

three years.
“(Israel) is my home,” she said. “This 
is where my family lives.” 
Ravid also said she has friends on the 
front lines fighting. 
“I pray for my friends who are sol-
diers,” she said. “They are fighting for 
Israel’s future and the future of this 
world.”
As the protesters worked their way 
down University, they received cheers and honks from people driving by.
“The fact that people are pro-Israel ex-
pression is a good thing,” said Rabbi Berl Goldman.
However, a different chant was heard 
in the distance as the pro-Israel protesters neared the plaza.
A group called United Voices for Peace 
waited in response to the approaching demonstration.
The diverse group of about 40 people 
united Muslims, Christians and Jews, who were protesting for peace and a halt to civilian casualties.
“We want peace, we want justice,” said 
UF senior Nadine Sfeir, a Middle Eastern studies major.
As Sfeir chanted “justice, peace, justice, peace,” tears streamed down her face. 
Born in Bethlehem, Sfeir lost her home 
when she was young.
Her family members were refugees 
for 15 years before obtaining U.S. citizen-ship.
Sfeir said she was against the killings 
on both sides and wants the occupation of Israeli forces in Gaza to end.
“Gaza is a baby,” she said. “It can’t 
walk, it can’t talk, it can’t feed itself. And when this baby grows up, it’s going to be 
a monster.”
While members of the pro-Israel pro-
test dispersed as the march ended, about 
15 students stayed behind to have an 
open discussion with the members of 
United Voices for Peace.
Sfeir said the issue was not one of poli-
tics but about the loss of life.
“We’re all citizens of the world,” Sfeir 
said. “Once they understand, they’ll see we’re all on the same ground.”Diverse group calls for peace

ON TELEVISION POLL QUESTION UP NEXTBy EVAN DREXLER
Alligator Staff Writer
edrexler@alligator.org
Coming into the season, he was 
a receiver with nine catches and no 
touchdowns to his name.
Five months later, he was on 
the receiving end of the clenching 
touchdown in the BCS National 
Championship Game on Thursday night.
It’s safe to say junior David 
Nelson has made some positive strides  in the Gators’ offense this season.When he first came to Gainesville, 
he expected to play right away, and it took him a while to realize that would not be the case.
“He didn’t 
practice very good, and he didn’t play very well,” coach Urban Meyer said Friday.
But his work 
ethic improved dramatically over the last two seasons, and his attitude toward his spot on the team is vastly 
improved as well. He knows it takes 
a special talent to get on the field as a freshman.
“You just got to come in here and 
just do what you can for your team,” Nelson said. “Work your way up. Not everybody can be Percy Harvin 
and play right away.”
Two springs ago, after UF de-
feated Ohio State to win the second 
football national championship in school history , Nelson went on a cruise, and the ship’s passengers confused him with then-quarterback Chris Leak. Most Gators fans would have been hard-pressed to pick him 
out of a lineup.

Yeah, Tim Tebow’s speech at the celebration 
Sunday may have given you pause. But deep 
down, you just kind of knew he was going to come back, 
right?
In an era of athletes being all about the money, it’s re-
assuring to know people like Tebow still exist. This is not 
a blanket statement — I understand there are some family 
circumstances where money simply is that crucial.
But now that the junior quarter -
back has satisfied many UF fans’ 
dreams, he must understand some-
thing.
In following the example of the 
’04s — Al Horford, Taurean Green, Corey Brewer and Joakim Noah — 
Tebow inherits the bar they set.
The expectations are already clear 
— it’s win a national title or bust for 
the 2009 Gators.
Now, you probably won’t hear them say it. Come spring and fall, UF players and coaches will utter 
the same “just get to Atlanta” rhetoric, but it’ll seem a little 
more empty this time around.
While UF fans may not have accepted it, the drop-off 
from 2006 to ’07 had to happen due to the lack of depth and 
an extremely young defense filled with players who simply 
weren’t ready to be starters in the grueling Southeastern Conference.
The excuse factor is gone now, because the 2008 Gators 
just became the youngest team ever to be crowned college football champs.
Barring injuries, the defense should compete to be one 
of the best ever in college football history. Certainly the top in 2009.
Heaven forbid Percy Harvin foregoes the NFL Draft. If he 
did, the Gators would also have one of the scariest offenses.
Best offense + best defense should equate to a national 
champion, right?Fans expect 3rd title
UF MEN’S BASKETBALL
By MIKE DiFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator.org
Walter Hodge’s haircuts have gone 
through almost as many ups and downs as 
the UF basketball team this season.
Everything from “GATORS” to 
“DEFENSE” has been shaved into the side of the senior’s head.
But Hodge is hoping his style will lead to 
a bit more substance for a UF team that has been anything but consistent. 
“It’s not about just looking good with a 
haircut,” Hodge said. “I’m doing it for the other guys.” 
Hodge’s hairstyle has changed almost on 
a game-to-game basis this season — each opponent brings him a new artistic vision.
“It will change. It just depends how I feel,” 
the guard said. “The guys like it. They’re al-ways looking for something new.”
If defensive back Joe Haden’s BCS de-
sign during last week’s championship game looked familiar, it’s because the pair share the same barber.
“At the SEC Championship, (Justin) 
Trattou had a Mohawk, and I liked the de-signs that he had in his head, and I asked him who did it so I could get it for the National Championship Game,” Haden said.
The man behind the madness is Tony, or 
as he is known to his customers, “Mr. T,” of So Sharp Cuts and Styles. 
“Joe and I go together sometimes,” 
Hodge said.
Designs range from team-oriented to per -
sonal.
During the basketball team’s November 
trip to Kansas City for the CBE Classic, Hodge’s hairstyles inspire teammates to performFootball

“Hopefully I’ve gotten past 
that now,” Nelson said, laughing. 
“Hopefully , now that he’s been gone for two years, hopefully I’ve made a name for myself now.”
After a 12-catch, five-touch-
down 2008 where he led the team in yards per catch (19), Nelson will begin next season as one of the top receivers. 
There is no doubt he made a 
name for himself this season, es-pecially with the touchdown catch Thursday coming on one of Tim 
Tebow’s famous jump passes.
Meyer said deciding which 
receiver would make that catch 
while designing the play was a painstaking process, one that took a long time to resolve.
“That was a two-hour discus-
sion about who’s going to get that play, because you only get one shot at it, and if you cut it short, go too deep, don’t sell it, you’re wasting a play ,” Meyer said. “We knew 
we were going to call it at a critical 
time.”
Nelson was also quick to deflect 
credit when asked about the touch-
down catch. He said any receiv-
er on the team would have been able to make the 
catch.
But his num-
ber was the one 
offensive co-ordinator Dan 
Mullen called. Why did they de-cide to go with Nelson in the end?
“That’s because he’s extremely 
disciplined and practices his tail 
off,” Meyer said.
That catch was five days ago, 
and Nelson is ready to start pre-
paring for 2009. He said he is going to enjoy the national championship victory for a little while but then work toward successfully defend-
ing UF’s crown next year.
“This is the most important off-
season of my life,” Nelson said. 
“Not only for myself, but to get this team ready to go play next year.”TEBOW UNDERGOES SURGERY: UF quarterback Tim Tebow, who announced he would return for his senior season Sunday, had ar -
throscopic surgery on his right shoulder early Monday morning.
The surgery was to remove a 
bone spur and reduce chronic in-flammation. Tebow aggravated the shoulder earlier this year after in-juring it in 2007.
Team physician Pete Indelicato 
said in a press release that Tebow 
should be able to throw again 
in three to four weeks, and the Heisman winner is expected to re-cover fully from the surgery.Tebow undergoes minor shoulder surgery

That’s a scary proposition, 
though. 
You never can tell how a team will 
respond to the off-season pressures 
of everyone projecting it as national 
champs, even with Urban Meyer’s 
well-known ability to motivate.
Meyer already has some good ma-
terial to use, though, if he looks up his 
rivals in Athens.
Georgia came into this season as 
a highly touted No. 1 with Matthew 
Stafford and Knowshon Moreno poised to win a ring in Miami.
The Bulldogs finished 10-3, didn’t 
even win the SEC East and played in the Capital One Bowl.Besides the mystique of repeat-
ing — that hasn’t been done since 
Nebraska in 1994-95 — there is one 
other thread of motivation: an unde-
feated season.
It’s never been done at UF, and 
Tebow has stated multiple times that 
it is a goal of his.
Can Tebow steer UF through the 
pressures and deliver UF’s first un-
blemished record?
He “couldn’t” win the Heisman — 
and then he did.
He “couldn’t” pass the ball well 
enough — and then did.
He “couldn’t” lead a team trailing 
in the fourth quarter — and then he did.
I wouldn’t bet against him.Hodge paid tribute to his 2-year-old daugh-
ter, Kaylanis, with the name “KIKI.”
“It’s something she can look at on TV and 
point at,” Hodge said. “She gets all excited 
and calls out, ‘Daddy! Daddy!’”
In fact, you could say Hodge has started a 
bit of a hair renaissance within the team.
“I got a little Mohawk going,” sopho-
more forward Chandler Parsons said. “But my hair is made a little different than his. It must be a Spanish thing.”
Parsons claims his new look started out as 
a Ray-hawk, as he cheered on the Tampa Bay Rays during the MLB playoffs, but Hodge’s influence is unmistakable.
According to Parsons, Hodge’s hair has 
made an impact on the team this season, though.“He’s all about the team,” Parsons said. 
“He’ll write whatever he thinks will help 
motivate us.”
Even the always-put-together, often-
gelled Nick Calathes has been caught up in 
Hodge Mania.
“It’s something we make fun of him 
about, but I think it defi-nitely helps us,” Calathes said. “When it says defense on his head, it means we have to lock down.” 
But would Calathes, 
who has been taunted by opposing fans in the past for his painstakingly styled 
hair, be willing to make the same sacrifice for the good of the team? 
“If the team needed me and wanted me to 
do it I would,” he said. 
“But probably not.”Senior’s haircuts improve team moraleNELSON , from page 14

n HE WON SUPER BOWL XLI 
WITH THE COLTS IN 2007.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
INDIANAPOLIS  — Tony Dungy 
has retired after seven years as coach 
of the Indianapolis Colts, saying this was the right moment.
“These seven years have been 
better than I could ever have imag-ined,” Dungy , the only black coach to win a Super Bowl, said at a news conference Monday . “I just have to thank everyone.”
He will be replaced by associate 
coach Jim Caldwell.
Dungy , 53, has spent the past 
five years debating whether to leave 
football to spend more time with his 
family. He said he and his wife dis-cussed the decision.
“We just felt this was the right 
time,” Dungy said. “Don’t shed any tears for me. I got to live a dream most people don’t get to live.”
Dungy is the Colts’ franchise 
leader in victories. He went 85-27 
in the regular season and 7-6 in the playoffs, including the victory over 
Chicago in the 2007 Super Bowl.
“You don’t always get to go out 
on top,” Dungy said, “and it’s 
hard to go out on top.”
The plan to 
have Caldwell replace Dungy was put in place last year when the coach pon-
dered retirement. Caldwell joined 
Dungy’s staff in Tampa Bay in 2001, then moved with Dungy to the Colts 
in 2002 as the quarterbacks coach. A year ago, Caldwell was elevated to associate head coach, though he continued to coach Peyton Manning 
and Jim Sorgi.
“He is ready , he’s more than 
ready ,” Dungy said. “He’s going to 
do a great job.”
Dungy’s decision comes a little 
more than a week after the Colts were eliminated from the playoffs. He spoke to several of his players Monday, including Manning.
“That’s the tough part,” Dungy said. “That’s been the emotionally draining part of today.”
He has spent the past five years 
debating whether to leave football, each year taking about a week to 
meet with his family in Tampa.
“I’m going to be a Colt forever,” 
Dungy said, adding that he plans to 
still spend time in Indianapolis.
The decision ends a tenure in 
Indianapolis during which Dungy led the Colts to the playoffs all sev-en seasons, winning five division titles and appearing in two AFC title 
games.

MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ST. PETERSBURG — The American League 
champion Tampa Bay Rays made another 
move Monday to bolster their depth and right-handed hitting, agreeing to a $1,000,018, one-year contract with outfielder Gabe Kapler.
The 33-year-old — who considers 18 his 
lucky number — came out of retirement last season to bat .301 with eight homers, 17 dou-bles, 38 RBIs and a .498 slugging percentage in 96 games with the Milwaukee Brewers.
After playing parts of four seasons in 
Boston, Kapler spent 2007 managing Red Sox Class A affiliate Greenville. He called the year away from the majors a learning experience that was “really important to my development as a human being more so than as a baseball player.
“I think it just provided me with an oppor -
tunity to take a breather and realize that I had 
a lot of passion for playing left in me,” Kapler 
said during a conference call. “That said, I also learned a lot of lessons about how to be strong mentally, and those lessons carried over into 2008 ... and I expect to be able to build on them in 2009.”
The deal with Kapler, a .273 career hitter 
with 72 homers and 340 RBIs, comes a week after the Rays agreed to a $16 million, two-year contract with Pat Burrell.
Kapler’s versatility as an outfielder was a 
factor, as well as his 26 homers and .294 career average against left-handed pitching. He hit .354 with four home runs and 22 RBIs against lefties in 2008.
The amount the Rays could afford to pay 
Kapler after giving Burrell a deal that vice president  Andrew Friedman said would limit Tampa Bay’s spending for the rest of this off-season was a factor as well.
“That was the extent of our flexibility,” 
Friedman said.
Kapler started 43 games for the Brewers. 
With B.J. Upton recovering from shoulder surgery performed after the World Series, his addition provides some flexibility for manager Joe Maddon.
“He further upgrades us against left-hand-
ed pitching. He can play all three outfield spots, and it’s further insurance in the event that B.J. is not ready opening day,” Friedman said.
