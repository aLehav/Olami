TENNESSEE 13 UF 23
Gators get win but fail to meet expectations
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@a Iligator org
Beating Tennessee never felt
so disappointing.
In a rivalry that goes a
long way toward deciding the
Southeastern Conference East,
both teams are content to take a
win any way they can get it, but
No. 1 Florida didn't deliver the
smackdown that was expected
in its 23-13 win against the Vol-
unteers.
"By the players' attitudes
going into the locker room
(they were disappointed),"
linebacker Ryan Stamper said.
"We won by 10 points against
Tennessee, and Tennessee has a
good team.
"We're used to beating teams
by 50 points, but I thought to-
day was a really well-fought
match. We haven't had one of
those around here in a long
time, but I think the hype is a
little too much."
Oddsmakers pegged the
Gators as more than four touch-
downs better than the Vols, but
when the dust settled, the real
difference between the twoteams was clear.
Florida had Tim Tebow, and
even on one of the quarter-
back's worst outings, he was
far better than his counterpart,
UT's Jonathan Crompton.
Tebow was 14 of 19 for 115
yards and an interception -his
second lowest yardage total as
a starter -and he registered a
66.8 rating, easily the worst of
his career as a starter.
This is the
second straight
year he strug-
gled against the
Football Volunteers. Last
season, he com-
pleted only 8
of 15 passes for 96 yards and
two touchdowns and added 26
rushing yards on 12 carries.
Tebow's nation-leading
streak of 30 games with a touch-
down pass came to an end, and
his fourth-quarter fumble near
the goal line caused a 14-point
swing.
But Tebow made the plays
the Gators needed.
He carried 24 times for 76
yards and a touchdown, con-

UF students absent because of
the swine flu may soon be able to
watch lectures over chicken noodle
soup.
In preparation for a possible
major outbreak of the HINI virus,
UF plans to equip nine auditoriums
with Mediasite, a lecture capture
system, by Oct. 1.
The system will allow UF in-structors to record their lectures, in-
cluding PowerPoint slides and ma-
terial written on chalk boards, said
Andy McCollough, UF's associate
provost for information technology,
e-Learning and distance education.
McCollough said about $150,000
from UF's emergency reserve has
been spent on the program's instal-
lation.
Once available, students will be
able to watch lectures from their
e-Learning accounts, McCollough
said.

Scalpers scam 78 at game
By THOMAS STEWART

You may have been disappointed with the
score on Saturday, but at least you didn't blow
hundreds of dollars on fake tickets.
Karen Tanski and her daughter Kayla, a sec-
ond-year UF nursing student, weren't so lucky.
After shopping around for a pair of tickets
Saturday afternoon, they thought they had found
the deal they were looking for when a man on
West University Avenue was willing to let them
go for $310. Others wanted $200 to $250 apiece.
But at the gate, their tickets didn't scan and
they were turned over to University Police De-
partment investigators, who told them they
weren't the only ones who had been scammed.
A total of 78 fake tickets, some bought for
$500, were handed over to the department Satur-day, though it's likely many other people chose
not to file reports, UPD Lt. Robert Wagner said.
Wagner said Saturday's ticket problem was
the biggest he's seen in the last 18 years.
"The positive spin on the whole
thing is we saved somebody else
from buying a fake."
Karen Tanski
UF parent
Tanksi and her daughter found out how
prevalent the problem was when they insisted
that officers follow them around to see if they
could catch their crook in the act.
Though they didn't find the guy, they con-
fronted another man selling similar tickets.
"I walk up to the man, and I say, 'How much

Swamp brings back memories for ESPN reporter
0 BROWN GRADUATED FROM UF IN
2003 WITH A CRIMINOLOGY DEGREE.
By JARED MISNER
Alligator Writer
Jenn Brown has 17 unopened law school
admission notices hidden in a box some-
where.
Now 28 and one of ESPN's rising corre-
spondents, she's in no hurry to open the enve-
lopes from Harvard, Yale and Stanford.
Brown, a 2003 UF criminology graduate, is
now the only female correspondent for Show-
time's "Inside the NFL," as well as a promi-
nent personality for ESPNU's "Road Trip," agig that brought her back to the Swamp Satur-
day after six years.
"It didn't hit me until I got off the exit at
Archer," Brown said. "It was like, 'Wow, I'm
back.' It's that surreal moment when it hits
you. [It's] where you spend some of the best
years of your life."
Although she said her four years in the
heart of The Gator Nation were some of the
best of her life, Brown said her return with
ESPN reminds her of all the fun she missed
in college by dedicating her time to academics
and the varsity softball team.
She said her career in sports broadcasting
was an accident. As a criminology student, she
intended to go to law school after taking a year
off to prepare for the LSAT.During that time a friend asked her if she
could fill in as a model for "Bikini Destina-
tions," an HDNet show.
Soon, Brownwas offered
the opportunity to host seg-
ments on the show and left
her law school dreams be-
hind. She flew to Los Ange-
les two weeks later to host
HDNet's "The Wild Side."
"Literally, I would wake
up every day, and I couldn't
believe people were paying
me to travel around the world and do the most
amazing things you could do in any country,"
she said.
An ESPN employee approached Brownand said the network was looking for a new
face and not "another 30-year-old white guy."
A self-proclaimed tomboy, Brown admits
her job in sports takes her to new levels in a
career usually reserved for men.
"I remember being on the playground as a
little kid racing the boys. I was always the first
picked for kickball," Brown said.
Brown said women have proven them-
selves, especially in sports broadcasting. She
pointed to Erin Andrews, a fellow Gator and
ESPN sports commentator, as a source of in-
spiration.
"I don't feel like I have to prove myself. I
got the job. I got it for a reason," she said. "I do
more lifestyle pieces. I love the ability to hu-
manize the players that we don't get to see."

Band plays to 1,700
By LYNETTE ZILIO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Sister Hazel received a warm wel-
come home Friday night at their sold-
out performance at the Phillips Center
for the Performing Arts.
More than 1,700 fans attended,
singing along and dancing in the aisles
as the five-man Southern rock group
took the stage.
Gainesville was one stop on the
band's national tour to promote its
newest album "Release."
Before the show, dressed in high
top Converse Chuck Taylors, a faded
green T-shirt and jeans, the band's lead
guitarist, Ryan Newell, said that it was
great to be back home.
The band was formed 15 years ago
in Gainesville.
"The energy and the vibe that we
have when we play in Gainesville is
different than when we play anywhere
else," Newell said.
Self-proclaimed "Hazelnuts" and
UF alumni David and Leslie Ramshaw
have seen the band perform about 10
times outside of Gainesville.
"But we're not groupies," joked Da-
vid Ramshaw, who's been a fan for thelast 10 to 15 years.
"We have some shirts, all their CDs
and Christmas ornaments," Leslie
Ramshaw said. "Our kids also have
shirts."
Before the band took the stage,
Gainesville-based singer/songwriter
Aslyn performed her opening act.
She received cheers from the crowd
as she belted out and played songs on
a grand piano.
Following her performance, card-
board replicas of each band member
were lowered to the front of the stage.
When the real band members came
out from behind the cutouts, they were
met with screams and clapping.
The cheering escalated into excited
shrieks and whoops as the band began
to play "Happy."
Stan Lynch, the drummer of fel-
low Gainesville band Tom Petty and
the Heartbreakers, made a guest ap-
pearance and played a few songs with
Sister Hazel. Audience members stood
and shouted "Go Gators" cheers.
After what appeared to be the last
song, the audience gave the band a
standing ovation, who left the stage
before returning to play their first hit
single, "All For You."Gainesville rock band Sister Hazel, led by frontman Ken Block (second from right) performs at the

Hispanic students talk sex, relationships at debate

Megan MacNamara and Philip
Nelson didn't need a clever pick-
up line to capture the attention of
UF students gathered in the Ustler
Hall Atrium Friday.
MacNamara and Nelson, psy-
chology interns at the UF Coun-
seling Center, got personal.
"So let's talk about sex a little
bit," MacNamara said to the audi-
ence of about 70. Nelson stood by
her side, ready to hand out con-
doms and candy to students who
spoke up during the presentation.
The Hispanic Student Associa-
tion hosted The Great Sex Debate
Friday night in celebration of His-
panic Heritage Month, encourag-
ing students to partake in an open-
forum discussion about romance,
relationships and intimacy.
UF sophomore Laura Alarcon,
who manages the UF HSA Web
site, led the debate.
"I wanted it to be an educa-
tional experience," she said. "It
was about the ugly truth and the
stereotypes prevalent in the Span-ish community."
MacNamara and Nelson led
the discussion, asking questions
about dating habits and sexual
intimacy.
MacNamara traced the debate
back to the Hispanic community
and interracial dating.
"A lot of times there's a culture
clash," she said. "Sometimes it's
a good educational experience to
get familiar with other partners."
MacNamara asked if any at-
tendees were ever pregnant or
had Hispanic friends
On who were pregnant.
CampuS About half raised
their hands.
Alex Laguerra-Sierra, UF ju-
nior and the event's internal pro-
gramming director, said it deliv-
ered an important message to the
Hispanic community.
"Our community as a whole is
often viewed as highly sexual,"
Laguerra-Sierra said. "Events
like this allow us to show that we
don't cater to that stereotype."

tinues until Oct. 15. For more in-

Animal Activists of Alachua protests sold-out circus
* NINE GROUP MEMBERS
RALLIED, HELD SIGNS.
By ROBERT HARRINGER
Alligator Contributing Writer
The line of patrons curved
around the building, and families
were turned away from a sold-out
circus at the Alachua County Fair-
grounds Friday night. However, a
few unexpected guests were fine
with standing on the street.
The Animal Activists of Alachua,
a UF student group, greeted circus
patrons with signs that read, "Does
abuse equal entertainment?" and
"Boycott the circus."
The group, whose Web site says
the goal is to "build an organization
that would serve as a voice for non-
human animals long after its found-
ers had graduated," hopes to see the
end of animals in circuses.
"All circuses that have animals
tend to abuse them," said Alyssa
Cohen, a junior biology major, and
president of the activist group.
"This one in particular has been
cited by the U.S.D.A. for failure to
provide veterinary care and failure
to provide shelter during extreme
heat," she added.
The Circus Pages, which is based
out of Myakka, Fla., sold out its only
show in Gainesville. The circus in-
cludes lions, tigers, elephants and
several other animals in its act.James Earhart, the circus ring-
master, said the circus has been writ-
ten up several times for non-compli-
ance issues by the Department ofAgriculture, which regulates circus
animals.
Earhart said most of the issues
were with veterinary records, andonce the circus was written up for
failure to properly shade a lion.
"We were written up because
a lion had the sun in his eyes," he
Robert Harringer / Alligator
Animal Activists of Alachua protestors hold up signs outside of the Circus Pages Friday night at the Ala-
chua County Fairgrounds.said.
"We treat our animals excellent
because they're a huge investment.
Each elephant cost 300 grand, and a
white lion can cost 25 to 50 grand,"
he said.
But according to a People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals flier,
the Circus Pages has been cited sev-
eral times by the Department of Ag-
riculture for mistreating animals.
One citation was for keeping the
circus's elephant, Bombi, from lying
down in its travel trailer because of a
neck chain that forced it to stand.
In 2007, the circus was cited for
failing to provide adequate veteri-
nary care as a result of declawing
two young tigers, which is not al-
lowed unless done for medical rea-
sons.
The Animal Activists of Alachua
had nine members show up to pro-
test on Northeast 39th Avenue in
front of the fairgrounds.
A few passing cars honked in
support, and one driver screamed
"animal rights!" out his window.
But the activists' signs didn't keep
anyone from entering the circus, ac-
cording to Cohen.
"None of the cars turned away,
but I think we got some people -
especially kids -to think twice next
time," she said.
But Earhart doesn't think animal-
free circuses are a realistic goal.
"It's not a circus without animals
-it's only a show," he said.

Trash Talk
Online lectures could
have unintended resultsWith the first round of exams approaching, UF may
find itself with a pile of unexpected consequences.
We aren't talking about "The Butterfly Effect,"
in which Ashton Kutcher's minuscule actions transform him
from frat boy to prisoner to amputee in his future. We are
talking about a case where the best intentions could produce
unintended outcomes.
To combat a possible HINI pandemic, UF plans to equip
nine auditoriums with a lecture recording system called
Mediasite so that students who contract swine flu can keep
up with class without infecting their peers. Additionally, all
written class materials must be posted on e-Learning, and
students are not required to provide doctors' notes if they
miss classes or tests due to illness.
UF's goal may be to prevent a massive campus swine flu
outbreak, but these new policies could encourage students
without the illness to stay home.
Like welfare, this system can be abused. However, just
because there are loopholes that make the system subject to
abuse, that doesn't mean the system should be nixed. Instead,
it should be tweaked to allow sick students to stay home but
also require accountability from students to prevent it from
unnecessary use.
Having lectures online could be a good thing. A dutiful
student could watch and re-watch lectures, making his or
her professors sound like Darth Vader and Alvin from "Club
Chipmunk: The Dance Mixes" for maximum entertainment
value.
This is the best-case scenario.
On the other side of the spectrum, an already struggling
student could decide that a hangover, pure laziness or a
beckoning call for a $5 milkshake at Cheeburger Cheeburger
are valid reasons to miss lecture. Why go to class if you can
watch it from the comfort of your home?
Likewise, not requiring a doctor's note for sick students
who miss class or exams is bound to be abused. No one
wants the girl from "The Exorcist" hacking bile all over their
Scantrons, but if someone really had swine flu, they could get
a doctor's note.
However, these possible consequences are not as extreme
as the ones Egypt is facing due to its government's reaction
to swine flu.
To prevent a major epidemic, the Egyptian government
called for the slaughter of the country's 300,000 pigs. Despite
the fact that international agencies quickly pointed out that
pigs weren't the problem, Egypt acted.
Now the country finds itself in a huge mess.
Because Egypt's trash collectors rely on pigs to dispose
of organic garbage, trash is piling up in the streets. Rotting
garbage and discarded food are sprawled all over towns and
neighborhoods.
UF's preventative measures are not nearly as extreme, nor
are they as misguided. They are, however, somewhat unnec-
essary and very abusable.
Professors should require doctors' notes from students
who miss class, and students shouldn't be able to access on-
line lectures without prior permission and a valid reason.
UF was right to respond to a possible threat. But the hast-
ily crafted solution needs work.
If the system isn't reworked to provide more accountabil-
ity from students, UF professors could find themselves with
an unexpected mess to clean up come exam time.

Probe should focus on policymakers
he intelligence community hasn't exactly felt thelove in the past few years.
First, infighting among intelligence agencies
helped contribute to the successful Sept. 11 terrorist at-
tacks, as The 9/11 Commission Report happily pointed
out. Then, there was the whole faux pas about Iraq and
weapons of mass destruction, and that the war would be
a "slam dunk!" as former CIA director George Tenet sup-
posedly exclaimed to President George W. Bush in early
2003.
And now, Attorney General Eric Holder's appointment
of a prosecutor focusing on detainee torture and abuse by
CIA agents only serves as the latest wound to the intel-
ligence community's fragile ego.
As a people who espouse a world view incorporating
our benevolent morality and virtue, the CIA and its breth-
ren have often perfected the art of overthrowing dicta-
tors, or, in many historical cases, installing pro-American
military dictatorships in countries most of us have never
heard of. Essentially, they've done the dirty work in the
dark so our conscience could remain light.
There is no question that the intelligence community
serves a vital role in national security and promoting U.S.
interests abroad. Besides providing the foundation for
countless action movies, Americans owe a huge debt to
the hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens in the in-
telligence community that defends our interests here and
abroad each day.
This is why Holder's decision this past week to crimi-
nally investigate CIA interrogators is so galling. The sure-
ly resulting macabre atmosphere in the intelligence com-
munity will do little to improve the quality of intelligence
collected and will only make skittish those responsible for
protecting America.
That was also the collective response from seven past
directors of the CIA in a letter sent to President Barack
Obama last week pleading him to back Holder off fromthe proverbial fence. The former di-
rectors, including Porter Goss, Te-
net and William Webster, warned
that "Attorney General Holder's
decision to reopen the criminal in-
vestigation creates an atmosphere
Matthew Christ of continuous jeopardy for those
letters@alligator org whose cases the Department of
Justice had previously declined to
prosecute."
The precedent set by Holder's decision to reopen a
criminal investigation after it was closed, simply because a
new administration has come into town, is reason enough
for seven former intelligence directors to pen a letter to
the president. But what should infuriate the former direc-
tors and anyone else is around whom the investigation is
centered.
Holder's decision not to expand his probe to the up-
per echelons of the last Bush administration and former
Department of Justice lawyers, and instead focus on the
officers who followed orders, a la Abu Ghraib, is what flies
smack in the face of true justice.
Sure, waterboarding, mock executions and threaten-
ing to sexually assault detainees' family members -all
breaches of conduct found by the 2004 CIA Inspector Gen-
eral Report on Torture -are abhorrent. But what's more
appalling is the attorney general's investigation of the in-
terrogators themselves, instead of the policymakers who
approved of such atrocious breaches of our national char-
acter and the Department of Justice lawyers who mangled
the law to allow these breaches, as many now believe to
have happened in the previous administration.
Investigating those who performed the abuses is cer-
tainly justice, but failing to investigate those who possibly
authorized the abuses is anything but justice.

Local restaurants
team up in dine out
By BROOKE KELLY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Share Our Strength, a nation-
al organization working to end
childhood hunger in the U.S. by
2015, is hosting its second annual
Great American Dine Out this
week.
Participating restaurants
choose how they want to contrib-
ute to the cause, from donating a
percentage of sales to creating
special dinner promotions, said
Cate Puzo, a spokeswoman for
Share Our Strength, in a state-
ment to Nation's Restaurant
News.
The proceeds from Captain
D's, located on Southwest Archer
Road, The Melting Pot of Ocala
and two McAlister's Deli restau-rants, located at Southwest 35th
Boulevard and Northwest 60th
Street, will go toward children's
hunger relief by supporting food
pantries and other organizations
that provide meals to at-risk chil-
dren and their families.
"We enjoy
Around helping with
Gainesville events like
these," said
Tiffany Flores, manager of one
of the participating McAlister's
Delis.
Last year, the organization
raised more than $500,000 from
about 4,000 participating restau-
rants.

UF celebrates day of peace
By JARED MISNER
Alligator Writer
Amy Panikowski was 22 and in Malawi on a
Peace Corps mission on Sept. 11, 2001.
Her Malawian landlord told her the news as
it trickled into the small East African country -
New York was gone -blown off the map.
Today on International Day of Peace, just after
the world commemorated the eighth anniversary
of that "new day of infamy," Panikowski, a UF
Peace Corps recruiter, is unsure whether America
has made much peaceful progress since then.
"I'd like to be an optimist and hope that world
peace will happen one day," Panikowski said. "It's
a slow process, but I don't think it's something we
can't do."
In an effort to meet the goal of Panikowski and
others with peace in mind, International Day of
Peace, a U.N.-established holiday, was designed
to end global conflict and promote a greater sense
of world peace celebrated every Sept. 21.
Mercedes Machado, director of multicultural
affairs at UF, started UF's first peace day celebra-
tion this year in hopes that it will continue in the
future and contribute to the worldwide peace ef-
fort.
"Hopefully this is an event where a whole dif-
ferent group of people can come together," shesaid of the kickoff celebration Sunday night, which
included a performance from UF a cappella choir
No Southern Accent, a poetry reading from local
poet Marcee Winthrop and a closing vigil where a
moment of silence was observed.
Winthrop, the self-described "Poverty Cinder-
ella," read from her self-published collection of po-
ems and commentary, "Poverty Revolution."
"Education doesn't stop when you
leave this university."
Amy Panikowski
UF Peace Corps Recruiter
While both Panikowski and Machado men-
tioned domestic struggles, including women's suf-
frage, the civil rights movement and the gay rights
movement, as signs of peaceful improvements,
both remain optimistic about the future of peace.
Winthrop pointed to a lack of understanding as
the biggest threat to world peace.
"I think this next generation is going to get sick
and tired of being sick and tired," Winthrop said.
Panikowski offered a suggestion to students.
"Try to learn as much as you can," she said.
"Education doesn't stop when you leave this uni-
versity."

support were also included in the
installation, he said.
In the past week, the UF Stu-
dent Health Care Center has seen
about 150 students with influenza
or influenza-like illnesses, said
Dr. Phillip Barkley, director of the
UF Student Health Care Center.
"That is probably only a frac-
tion of the total number of people
who really have had symptoms,"
Barkley said. "I suspect there are
a lot of people who are dealing
with this at home and doing well
with it."
Students experiencing flu-like
symptoms are encouraged to stay
at home, take Tylenol for the fe-
ver, stay hydrated and wait 24
hours after the symptoms have re-
solved before returning to school,
Barkley said.
UF instructors have been
asked to be lenient with atten-
dance policies and encourage stu-dents to stay home by providing
all written class material on the
e-Learning Web site.
Once the possibility of a swine
flu epidemic has passed, instruc-
tors using the auditoriums with
Mediasite will be given the option
to record lectures, McCollough
said.
He said stu-
UcdeF c dents will nowAcademics beable to have
an inventory
of their lectures, which will come
in handy.
"If I could, I'd re-watch my
lectures a second or third time
to catch anything I may have
missed," said Todd Lanier, a UF
senior. "Too bad this wasn't avail-
able during my freshman year."
Mediasite will be installed
in Weimer, Turlington, Pugh
and Norman halls as well as the
New Physics Building, McCarty,
Computer Science Engineering,
Chemistry Laboratory Building
and Carleton auditoriums.

Students 'friend' officials
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writer
Facebook stalking has taken on a new
meaning.
College applicants are using the social
networking site to hunt down admissions of-
ficers, according to a new Kaplan Test Prep
and Admissions survey featuring 401 of the
nation's top universities.
In fact, 71 percent of college admissions
officers at the colleges say they or another
admissions officer have received a Facebook
or MySpace friend request from an applicant,
according to the survey.
Although UF did not participate in the
survey, other Florida schools, like Florida
Institute of Technology and University of
Central Florida, said state schools are using
Facebook as a recruiting tool.
The University of North Florida's admis-
sions office has created a page that has about
250 fans.
Katie MacInnes, the assistant director of
admissions marketing, communications and
articulation at UNF, said the page includes
photos, contact information and a list of ad-
missions events.
The page works hand in hand with theadmissions office Web site and aids in the re-
cruitment process, MacInnes said.
Kristen Campbell, the director of college
prep programs for Kaplan, said Facebook
pages for admissions offices are also useful
in an economy that makes it difficult to visit
colleges.
Facebook allows more opportunities to
share the essence of the college through fea-
tures like videos, Campbell
said.
She said it was interest-
ing to note how students
have switched to being
proactive when it comes to
letting admissions officers
see their profiles. Rather
Orlando than accusing college ad-
missions officers of invad-
ing their privacy by looking at their profiles,
students are encouraging the officers to be-
come their Facebook friends, she said.
UF's Office of Admissions does not have a
Facebook page.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said the
large number of UF applicants would make
it difficult to create.
But, UF is not ruling out this new use of
social media, Orlando said.

'I want $200,'and I said,'I bet you do,"'
Karen Tanski said.
The man, James C. Parker, was ar-
rested and charged with five counts of
ticket fraud.
"The positive spin on the whole
thing," Karen Tanski said, "is we saved
somebody else from buying a fake."
And even though they had been
ripped off, they were still able to go to
the game. She said the ticket office was
apparently holding extra tickets for
people who had purchased fakes.
So they paid another $80 and
watched the game from good seats, sit-
ting next to others who had been in the
same situation, Karen Tanski said.
Wagner said the increase in coun-
terfeits Saturday may have been the
result of a new ticket scanning system
that makes catching fakes easier.
He said the problem has also wors-
ened in recent years since street scalp-
ing was made legal.

though.
Wagner cautioned people against
buying tickets from strangers on street
corners and said many of the fake
tickets had "Ticketmaster" printed on
them, something real University Ath-
letic Association tickets don't have.
He said UPD will increase its efforts
to prevent ticket fraud in the future but
declined to reveal specific tactics.
As for other game day offenses,
UPD reported eight people were ar-
rested and another 48 were ejected
from Saturday's game.
By comparison, when UF played
Tennessee in Gainesville two years
ago, 37 people were arrested and an-
other 52 were ejected.
None of those arrested during Sat-
urday's game were students.
"I can't remember the last time we
had no students arrested," Wagner
said.
The game also saw the first two fans
ejected for smoking. It was the third
game in which smoking was banned.

UF FOOTBALL
Defense gets job done
despite loss of Spikes
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator org
As Florida's defense jogged onto the field
clutching to a 23-13 lead with 6:01 remaining
in the fourth quarter against rival Tennes-
see, All-America linebacker Brandon Spikes
watched from the sideline.
Spikes developed tendinitis in his Achilles
during practice this week and was unable to
play the entire game Saturday.
The middle linebacker played the majority
of the first half, but the pain was too great to
keep him on the field full time, as he rotated
in and out for much of the second half.
"I saw Spikes on the sideline with his
shoes off and I went up to (defensive coor-
dinator Charlie Strong) and I said, 'What's
going on?' safety Ahmad Black said. "'Why
isn't our playmaker in the game?' He's hurt. I
was like, 'Aw nah, he can't be.'
With Spikes at less than 100 percent, Ten-
nessee was able to run the ball effectively with
senior Montario Hardesty, who racked up 96
yards on 20 carries and scored the first touch-
down UF's defense has allowed all season.
Florida coach Urban Meyer said he felt
the defensive line did a good job controlling
the line of scrimmage, but when the Tennes-see running backs were met in the hole, the
Gators missed too many tackles.
Senior outside linebacker Ryan Stamper,
who moved inside with Spikes sidelined,
didn't blame UF's tackling woes on Spikes'
injury.
"We feel like the defense needs to
be good enough to step up. Spikes
is the leader, he's a great player,
but we feel like with the players we
have on the defense we should be
able to get it done."
Ryan Stamper
UF senior outside linebacker
Stamper led the team with 12 tackles -
three of them for a loss -and recorded a sack
and a forced fumble.
"We feel like the defense needs to be good
enough to step up," Stamper said. "Spikes is
the leader, he's a great player, but we feel like
with the players we have on the defense we
should be able to get it done."
The Gators' offense failed to get it done for
most of the game, looking out of sync on its
way to scoring just 23 points, UF's lowest out-

Underclassmen spark rout
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@alligator org
Young people can be so impatient.
No. 7 Florida (6-3-0) outclassed Eastern
Kentucky (3-6-0) 5-1 on Sunday, and all of
the team's goals came from underclassmen.
Freshmen Natalia Torosian and Brooke
Thigpen each had two goals, and sopho-
more Lindsay Thompson scored on a head-
er.
The Gators got on the scoreboard in the
38th minute when Sarah Chapman chipped
the ball to Nicky Kit on the left flank. Kit
then chested the ball to an unmarked Toro-
sian.
Torosian squared up to the goal after her
first touch and ripped a shot over EKU goal-
keeper Stephanie Lynch from 25 yards out.
Until that point, the Gators were plagued
by sluggish play. A UF victory was a fore-gone conclusion, but the team failed to im-
pose its will.
Coach Becky Burleigh said she had a
feeling UF would play sloppy after losing
1-0 to FSU on Friday in a draining game that
took 93 minutes to decide.
"We didn't come into this game with as
much hype as we did Friday, and it kind of
showed in the beginning," said Thompson,
who played the entire game against the
Seminoles.
The Gators looked energized by Toro-
sian's goal, but they must have lost their
enthusiasm in the locker room because the
team resorted to careless play to start the
second half.
EKU midfielder Carly Muller chased
down a ball near the UF goal line on the
right side of the field. With Jazmyne Avant
marking her, Muller freed herself after a

Saturday's sloppy affair in which
an overmatched Tennessee team was a
decent quarterback away from upset-
ting No. 1 Florida.
Saturday's showdown in The Swamp
was one everyone couldn't wait to see,
but only to watch how Meyer would
exact his revenge against the guy who
insulted the Gators several times in the
offseason.
If that's how UF plays angry, fans
will be on the edge of their seats quite
a few Saturdays this fall.
There was a reason people even
thought about UF scoring 100 in this
game, something Florida hasn't even
done against a nonconference cupcake
opponent.
The notion was obviously ridicu-
lous, but the Gators are the defending
national champions with almost every-
one returning and averaged 59 pointspr game before
Saturday.
So the fact that
Meyer smiled as

Kiffin should be the one smiling.
He did everything possible to rile up
everyone in Gainesville, and what did
the big bad Gators do? They won by 10
points.
Sure, it's impressive that Meyer is
now 5-0 against Tennessee and 13-1 in
rivalry games.
But of those five victories against
the Volunteers, this one was the closest
thing to a lock as there can be in college
football.

UF's depleted receiving corps struggles
FOOTBALL, from page 1
verting three third downs and a fourth down
with his legs.
On Florida's third-quarter touchdown
drive, he pulled off a 4-yard scramble on
third and 3 after rolling to his right, doubling
back to the left sideline and breaking two
tackles behind the line of scrimmage, diving
for the first-down marker as he went out of
bounds.
"Once it gets to third and 3, you know
what's going to happen," UT coach Lane Kif-
fin said. "They're going to snap it to [Tebow],
he's going to run, you're going to have a guy
there and he's going to run through him for
the first down.
"I guess the answer is, we need to find a
Tim Tebow in recruiting. That would help us
probably."
Kiffin's offense struggled with Crompton
at the helm in key situations.
The Vols had success on the ground, tal-
lying 117 yards, and Crompton picked up
most of his 93 passing yards on screens and
dumpoffs.
But the only times Crompton was asked
to look downfield, he underthrew receivers
and was intercepted.
UF's Joe Haden and Ahmad Black were
the recipients, snatching second-half inter-
ceptions that swung the momentum and
sealed the game, respectively.
Haden and Black's interceptions were the
longest catches of the game, coming 22 and
25 yards from the line of scrimmage.
The Volunteers shut down the Gators'
deep passing game, which was nonexistent
without wideout Deonte Thompson (ham-
string) in the lineup, and Riley Cooper was
limited because of a pinched nerve.
"Right now, our receiving corps is not up
to Florida standards," UF coach Urban Mey-
er said. "When Deonte is in, I think it is.
Dogs are people, too!
Permanently chaining a
dog is cruel.
Don't Chain
Your Dog"There's going to be a lot of urgency this
week with that group because it limits you
when you don't have a vertical stretch in
your offense."
Four other key players were hurt or lim-
ited Saturday.
Tight end Aaron Hernandez, running back
Jeff Demps and defensive end Jermaine Cun-
ningham were all hampered by illnesses, and
linebacker Brandon Spikes had to leave the
game after aggravating an Achilles strain.
Meyer said Demps' flu-like symptoms
were just beginning, so he could miss some
time this week, and he expects Spikes to play
through the pain next week
against Kentucky.
The Gators being less
than full strength certainly
made life easier for the Vols,
but Kiffin pointed to a dif-
ferent reason for his team's
inspired performance.
Kiffin He was hailed with ver-
bal abuse as soon as UT's
buses neared The Swamp, and he wouldn't
have had it any other way.
"I think it worked perfect," Kiffin said. "It
took all the pressure off our players and al-
lowed us to play free. When you come play
the No. 1 team in the country in your third
game together, you don't want all the pres-
sure on your players. Put it on me. I'm the
coach. I don't have to play the game."
That didn't keep Kiffin from noticing,
though.
He said there were "a lot of F-words that
aren't Florida" being yelled at him, and one
fan held up a large photo of Oakland Raiders
owner Al Davis, who fired Kiffin, as the Vols
came out of the tunnel.
"The picture of Al Davis made me laugh,"
Kiffin said.

UF VOLLEYBALL
Gators outbiocked again in sweep of Razorbacks
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
achia ng@a Iligator org
There was more on the line than
usual for Florida.
The Gators needed to win in
straight sets in order to catch their
flight back to Gainesville. If not, they
would need to stay overnight.
Apparently, they didn't want to
spend any more time in Fayetteville,
Ark., than they had to. No. 5 Florida
(8-1, 2-0 Southeastern Conference)
cruised to a victory against Arkan-
sas (7-6, 1-1 SEC) in timely fashion
Sunday (25-16,25-19,26-24) and was
able to catch its flight back home.
"The only way we are going tomake our flight is if we won in three
sets, so the team was highly moti-
vated," UF coach Mary Wise said.
Sophomore outside hitters Kristy
Jaeckel and Colleen Ward seemed
especially determined to avoid an
extra night on the road.
Jaeckel finished the match with
12 kills and eight digs, just shy of
her second double-double of the
weekend. Ward continued to show
improvement from 2008, accounting
for 14 of the team's kills while post-
ing a .448 hitting percentage.
"Colleen is learning that not
every set can be hit a million miles
per hour," Wise said. "If you take
something off the ball and it stays
in bounds, we benefit from that,and that shows the maturing of her
game.",
Although the match turned out
to be a quick win for the Gators,
they needed a comeback in the third
set to seal the win.
Down 22-19, UF
used four Arkan-
sas attack errors
to narrow the gap
and eventually
end the match.
UF was again
Cusack outblocked, seven
to six. Sophomore
Cassandra Anderson is the only
player on the team averaging more
than one block per set.
Despite that, the Gators' defenseand ability to avoid mistakes turned
out to be the difference in the match.
They hit six service aces to their five
service errors and limited the Razor-
backs to a .144 hitting percentage.
But UF was not as efficient be-
hind the line Friday, when it was
pushed to the limit by Ole Miss (6-
6, 0-2 SEC). The Gators eventually
won the match 3-2 (21-25, 25-16, 25-
17, 26-28, 15-11) but struggled with
their serving the entire night.
UF was only able to hit one ace
Friday while committing 14 service
errors. But it appears the team was
able to fix that Sunday, as it racked
up a season-high number of aces.
Senior libero Elyse Cusack dug
up a combined 40 balls over theweekend and moved into third place
on the all-time SEC digs list Friday.
The Ole Miss match was also
a good one for sophomore setter
Kelly Murphy, as she filled up the
stat sheet with 20 kills, 32 assists and
16 digs for her second triple-double
of the season and the eighth of her
short career at UF.
The Gators have completed their
longest road trip of the season and
will return to the O'Connell Center
for the first time since Aug. 31.
"We asked a lot of this team to
go three weekends in a row on the
road," Wise said. "This was not an
easy road trip."

yards out past goalkeeper Katie Fraine.
At the 53rd minute, the heavily favored Gators
were tied with the Colonels 1-1.
Once again, it was Torosian who provided a spark
for UF.
"I knew once we got scored on I had to step
up again," Torosian said. "One goal wasn't good
enough."
Torosian continued to create opportunities for UF,
crossing a ball into the penalty box that McKenzie
Barney almost headed in, but the team did not score
until the 67th minute. Torosian found the ball after a
blocked shot was deflected her way. She then drib-
bled past a defender and took a shot from 18 yardsout that found the upper left corner.
Any hope the Colonels had left was gone 29 sec-
onds later, when Torosian chipped the ball to Thig-
pen, who took a shot from the left wing. Lynch ap-
peared to record the save, but mishandled the ball as
she fell and it rolled into the back of the net.
A minute later, the Gators scored on a Thompson
header from Kit, and the game was capped off by an-
other Thigpen goal in the 87th minute.
During the last four games, Thigpen has emerged
as a scoring weapon. She has scored three goals and
recorded two assists in that span. Thigpen said UF's
3-0 loss to UCLA on Sept. 6 was a wakeup call.
"I personally realized (after the loss that) I got to
start playing faster and be more confident and play
like I know how to play and not be so intimidated by
the college level," she said.Secondary extends streak

As a result, UF leaned on its Spikes-less defense, which respond-

The secondary completely shut down the Volunteers' passing
game, holding UT quarterback Jonathan Crompton to 93 yards on
11-of-19 passing.
Cornerback Joe Haden and safety Ahmad Black picked off
Crompton, extending the Gators' streak to 15 consecutive games
with an interception.

Men, women victorious in opener for fifth straight year
* CHARLOTTE BROWNING
WON THE WOMEN'S 5K.
By JESSICA ETTER
Alligator Writer
The men's and women's cross
country teams began the season
on the right foot as both placed
first in the Mountain Dew Invita-
tional on Friday night.
"It was a great way to start the
season," UF coach Todd Morgan
said. "We didn't let up on our
training this week, and our team
had great results."The No. 14 women's team,
which beat 22 other teams, had
four runners place in the top five.
Following the Gators in team re-
sults were Tampa and South
Florida, which came in second
and third, respectively.
Charlotte Browning won
the women's 5K with a time of
17:25.08. The junior clocked the
third-best time ever recorded on
Mark Bostick Golf Course, where
all UF home meets are held.
"I think this has shown how
well we have progressed as a
team," Browning said. "Our team
is so good this year, and I am gladothers (think so), too. 
"
Genevieve LaCaze, who won
last year's meet as a freshman,
came in second with a time of
17:41.03. Junior Kaitlin Shiver
and senior Julie Northrup fin-
ished in fourth
and fifth, respec-
tively. Northrup
recorded a per-
Cross sonal-best time ofCountry 17:52.18.
The men's
team, which finished first ahead
of 17 other schools, had runners
finish in every place from second
through seventh.Embry-Riddle's Evans Kirwa
won the men's 8K with a time
of 24:21.1 leading his team to a
second-place finish and North
Florida finished in third.
Junior Anthony Morales, who
placed second, set a personal-best
time of 24:24 and recorded the
10th-best time for a UF runner on
the Mark Bostick Golf Course.
Daniel Manco finished fourth
but was on crutches following his
run.
Morgan said he was unsure of
the extent of the injury but feels
the redshirt freshman will get
better as the season continues.Along with injuries, Morgan
said some runners, including
graduate student Stacey Johnson,
were kept out of the invitational
due to illness.
"We've had some sickness
come through us pretty fierce,"
he said. "But I'm glad it is going
around now and not later in the
season."
The teams will not have an-
other race until Oct. 2, when they
compete in the Notre Dame Invi-
tational in South Bend, Ind.
Last season, the men tied for
sixth at that meet while the wom-
en placed fifth.
PHIL, from page 17
move the Florida Gators to a deserted is-
land somewhere and let's go play football
and not worry about all this nonsense and
just go play the game," Meyer said. "I've
never seen anything like it this past week.
You just try to shelter them and make sure
they focus on what's important and not
this silly nonsense."
Poor, poor Florida.
That's what happens when you have
the most talented team in the country. It's
time for the Gators to show it.
Simply winning Saturday should not
have been the objective, not if winning
back-to-back national titles is a goal.
Talent alone will win this UF team al-
most every game it plays, and that's a hugecredit to the Gators' recruiting.
But Lane Kiffin and his father Monte,
Tennessee's defensive coordinator, laid out
a pretty good game plan for teams looking
to upset Florida.
Run the ball and use a zone defense
while sprinkling in some blitzes.
It worked like a charm for Tennessee,
to the point that if quarterback Jonathan
Crompton wasn't completely inept, the
Volunteers could have pulled an amazing
upset.
Tebow was sacked three times and was
forced into running the ball 24 times, more
than running backs Emmanuel Moody,
Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey combined. It
was the most Tebow carried since the 2007
South Carolina game, in which Tebow
rushed 26 times for 120 yards and fivetouchdowns.
Tebow was indecisive in the pocket,
holding onto the ball too long and taking
off too many times. He had an interception
deep in his own end and a fumble in the
red zone.
Meyer admitted Tebow didn't play his
best game, and the whole offense reeked of
early 2008 -conservative playcalling and
production way below the Gators' poten-
tial. UF had two plays longer than 20 yards
-runs by Moody and Demps.
Monte Kiffin's zone defense forced Flor-
ida to keep everything short in the passing
game, and with the success Tennessee had,
the Gators should expect to see it again.
Florida must find some consistent play-
makers at receiver. No Gator had 30 yards
receiving. Tebow didn't have a passingtouchdown for the first time in 31 games.
On offense, Tennessee slowed the game
down, and it proved to be very effective.
The Volunteers ran 32 times for 117 yards,
an average of 3.7 yards per carry, helped
by Florida missing far too many tackles.
"I think there's so much pressure on
this team to perform perfectly," Meyer
said after the game. "I mean, I'd rather be
on that end than, 'Boy, great job, we lost by
10.' I don't want to do that. There's a lot of
pressure on these guys, and I felt it in [the
locker room]."
And the Gators will continue to feel it
all the way through January. That's the
unfortunate consequence of being the No.1
team in the country.
Now it's up to Florida to start playing
like it.
