  Shaquille O’Neal lifts an audience member in celebration after she was crowned the 
“Dougie” champion.

  Charming the crowd with jokes and 
pranks, National Basketball Association icon Shaquille O’Neal spoke in front of about 3,200 people at the O’Connell Center on Tuesday evening. 
  O’Neal has played for teams like the Or-
lando Magic and the Miami Heat, and his TV appearances and endorsements have made him a household name.
  “When it comes to thinking about ‘mak-
ing it,’” O’Neal said, “I haven’t made it yet. And that’s what keeps me going.”
Accent Speakers Bureau paid O’Neal 
$70,000 to speak. 
  Taking the stage shortly after 8 p.m., 
O’Neal sat in one of two low-slung mocha lounge chairs on stage while moderator Laura McKeeman asked him about life on the road, his relationship with Kobe Bryant and his upcoming career move to TNT com-mentator.
  But the “Shaq Attack” is also hard at 
work off the court.
  From his past work as an undercover 
cop investigating Internet crimes involv-ing children to his recent efforts to ﬁ  nish his Ph.D. at Barry University, O’Neal is, as Ac-cent Chairman Corey Portnoy put it in his introduction, a “Shaq of all trades.”
  “Shaq was truly an entertainer,” Portnoy 
said. “But, more importantly, [he] is a good teacher and a phenomenal leader to hear from about all of his accomplishments both in the professional world and the athletic world.”

� IT IS AN SG-FUNDED TEST THAT 
WILL BE CONDUCTED THIS SPRING.

  Library West will be open for 24 hours 
Sunday through Thursday in the spring if 
a Student Senate bill earns ﬁ  nal approval. 
The bill would transfer $59,174 from 
Student Government reserve funds to George A. Smathers Libraries to extend Li-brary West’s hours.
  The Senate unanimously gave primary 
approval at Tuesday night’s meeting. 
  Budget committee chairwoman and 
Unite Party spokeswoman Christina Bonarrigo said she wasn’t surprised when the Senate approved the funds transfer.
  “I know that so many students face the issue of trying to ﬁ  nd a study area,” she said. 
    The spring hours extension is a “pilot 
project” test that SG is funding. She said if the test proves to be a success, Library West will keep and fund the extended hours.
  The SG funds would cover the costs of 
two library assistants, a student assistant and a security guard. Bonar-rigo said the library would cover the utilities costs.  The Starbucks by the main entrance will keep the same hours as the library, she said.
  Library West is open 
from 8 a.m. to 1 a.m. Monday through Thursday, 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m. to 1 a.m. Sunday .  Library West to extend hoursHOMECOMING

  Swamp Symphony, an outdoor orches-
tra concert, has been added to the lineup of 
Homecoming activities this year.
  Sponsored by the College of Fine Arts 
and UF Homecoming, the concert will take place Thursday from 6 to 8 p.m. on Flavet Field.
  About 150 performers are scheduled for 
the event, including the Mens Glee Club, Pazeni Sauti Africa Choir, Opera Theater, Gator Jazz Band, UF School of Theatre and Dance and Sunshine Steelers steel-drum ensemble. 
  Students from Sidney Lanier School, 
for Gainesville students with intellectual disabilities, will also perform, led by UF alumnus Don DeVito. 
  The UF symphony orchestra, which cel-
ebrates its 100th anniversary this year, will headline the event and remain on-stage in between other performances, said Lau-ren Kingry, 23, associate conductor for the symphony orchestra.
  “We don’t normally do events like this,” 
Kingry said. “We’re normally segregated in our discipline.”
  “We Are The Boys From Old Florida,” 
“Orange and Blue” and the Alma Mater have been reorchestrated for the concert. 
The symphony orchestra will perform 
original compositions by 23-year-old UF senior Evan Kassof, UF alumna Stella Sung and music professor Paul Basler.
  “We’re really excited to be involved,” 
said Kingry, also a second-year graduate student in ochestral conducting. “We don’t normally do Gator tunes.” 
  Andy Howard, the marketing director 
for the College of Fine Arts, came up with the idea for the concert. 
He decided the concert could be a way 
to involve the CFA with Homecoming ac-Swamp Symphony to debut

With dried mud peeling from their 
bodies, five people ran on campus and 
along University Avenue on Tuesday evening as cars honked and onlookers stared. 
The women, in running shorts and 
either T-shirts or sports bras, and men, bare-chested and dressed in basketball shorts, ran to promote the first Gator Mud Run.
The 5K race and obstacle course 
will take place Nov. 6 at Canterbury Equestrian Showplace, 23100 NW Newberry Road.
The event will include a mud moun-
tain, rope swings and slip ‘n’ slides.
Jeff Tatarchuk, 25, a traveling pas-
tor from Southern California, came up with the idea for Gator Mud Run while visiting friends in Gainesville.
Although clothing isn’t optional, 
any outfit will fly and costumes are encouraged.
“It’s all about reliving childhood,” 
Tatarchuk said.
Registration is priced at $64, but the 
price will increase incrementally as the the race gets closer, Tatarchuk said. 
A $500 cash prize will be awarded 
to the fastest runner and a mystery prize to the person with the best cos-tume. 
For registration, see gatormudrun.
com, and enter the coupon code get-muddynow for $5 off. 
Of the proceeds, $10 will go to the 
Boys & Girls Club of Alachua County.
Kristi Jukovich, 25, who ran on 
campus  Tuesday, said the idea came about from a love for running. 
“It’s a fun way to be fit,” she said.Mud-covered students run

A man was charged with rape after hav-
ing sex with a sleeping woman Sunday at 
her apartment in the 3000 block of South-west 35th Place.
Wergimson Salomon, 26, of West Palm 
Beach, told police he had had intercourse with the victim without her consent but thought it was OK when he heard no pro-test. 
Salomon attended a party Saturday night 
at the victim’s apartment at about 11 p.m., according to a report written by Gainesville Police Officer Michael Maresca that was ob-tained from the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office. 
Salomon, who is listed on sheriff’s re-
cords as a self-employed basketball player, saw the victim at the party, but they did not interact, police said. 
The party ended soon afterward, and ev-
eryone left the apartment. 
The victim and another person, who 
would later witness the rape, returned to the apartment at about 3 a.m. Sunday and went to sleep, according to sheriff’s office records.
Salomon entered the apartment at about 
5 a.m. through the unlocked front door, po-lice said. 
He then went into the 
bedroom where the victim and witness were sleep-
ing and used a condom to have sex with the sleeping victim.
The victim woke up 
during  the act but said she was “too scared to fight or 
object,” according to sheriff’s office records.
The witness, who was asleep in the room, 
woke up, fled the room and called police. 
Police found Salomon at the apartment 
complex. 
Salomon is being held at the Alachua 
County Jail on $100,000 bond, according to the jail website. 
He has been charged with sexual assault, 
a second-degree felony, and burglary with assault or battery, a first-degree felony.Man, 26, charged with

Students will have the opportunity 
Friday to guess just how many con-
doms are crammed into a jar.
UF’s chapter of Vox: Voices for 
Planned Parenthood will host its annu-al sexual health fair, Sex on the Lawn, on the North Lawn.
The event will consist of carnival 
games, arts and crafts and “condom races.” There will also be a sex expert at the event to answer questions. 
“We live in kind of a sex-negative so-
ciety, and in Vox, we encourage people to talk about [sex] and have some sort of dialogue about their sexual experi-ences and who they are sexually,” said Rosemary Daniels, 20, a psychology se-nior and president of Vox.  
Pride Student Union is co-sponsor -
ing the event. 
In addition, the event will offer free 
HIV testing at the Reitz Union.“It is a really easy process that in-
volves an oral swab,” Daniels said. “People always think that it’s painful or involves blood.” 
She said by offering the test for free, 
Vox encourages students to talk about their status and create an open dia-logue about getting tested for sexually-transmitted diseases and infections. 
“When it comes to sexual safety, we 
can’t talk about it enough because it is obviously still an epidemic in America to have unsafe sex,” said Devon Faria, 19, an anthropology sophomore and internal vice president of Pride Student Union.
The event will start at 10 a.m. and 
will run until 4 p.m. Free pizza, cup-cakes and drinks will be provided.Condom races, jar to return

Wedding bells signal the beginning of a 
new life together. For a recent UF graduate, 
it signified a new business plan.
Jay Swedlaw, 29, was inspired to create 
a travel business after attending a wedding with a friend about a year ago. He was in-spired by the wedding’s gift registry. 
Swedlaw’s website, myvojo.com, is meant 
to help people who want to travel. Instead of receiving gifts for a birthday or graduation, users register online and allow their friends and family to contribute to their trips. 
“It seemed like something people could 
get behind,” he said.
Swedlaw used $7,500 to start the website, 
which he spent the last nine months devel-oping. 
“We also did lots of research … to see if 
there was anything like this out there,” he said. “We took a risk.”He graduated from UF in 2004 with a de-
gree in psychology. 
The cost of using the site correlates with 
the cost of the trip. 
Myvojo.com charges 9 percent of the to-
tal amount of money a user receives for his or her trip. 
Not everyone thinks the site is a good use 
of money. 
Hannah Dwyer, a printmaking sopho-
more, said she could just have her family  give her money directly instead.
However, she said the website might be 
good for some people. 
“I feel like that would really encourage 
traveling and seeing other cultures,” she said.
The site went live about three weeks 
ago. 
So far, it has had plenty of visitors but not 
many customers, Swedlaw said. 
“We need to turn those site visitors into 
site users,” he said.
“We were always brainstorming about 
the next million dollar idea,” he said. “Right now we have to have our humble beginnings, and hope that it moves up from there.”Alum creates travel donation site

This year, people going to the 
Florida-Georgia game can partici-
pate in the “The World’s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party” with Playmates.
For the first time, Playboy will 
host the Girls of the SEC Florida-Georgia Pregame Party on Friday in Jacksonville. It will benefit the Breast Cancer Research Founda-tion.
The party, held at River City 
Brewing Company, will let Flor -
ida-Georgia fans meet promo-tional models and Playmates for photo opportunities.
The event will feature past and 
present Playmates along with music by DJ Infader.
The event was encouraged by 
the popularity of Playboy’s col-lege issue, “Girls of the SEC.”
“Playboy’s college pictorials 
have been one of the most-talked about and popular pictorials in the magazine,” said Catherine Walker, Playboy publicist, “so we were delighted to run photos of some of the most beautiful SEC coeds again this year.”
Dave Berg and Matt Richard-
son, event producers, said they hope this event becomes an an-nual way to celebrate Florida-Georgia weekend and raise breast cancer awareness as the game falls in October, National Breast Cancer Awareness Month.
Richardson said he was en-
couraged to reach out to Playboy after years of working with char -
ity fundraisers.
“Every year we want to change 
it up and make it refreshing,” he said. 
Tickets for the event start at 
$25 general admission for access to River City Brewing Company’s cash bar, gift bags, hors d’oeuvres and a laminate badge. VIP tick-ets cost $100 and include marti-nis and beer all night, Playmate magazine signings, photo oppor -
tunities, valet parking passes and a round-trip taxi service. Passes can be purchased through www.wepay.com/tickets/view/12798.Playboy to

16% NOTuesday’s question: Do you consider 
yourself sexually healthy and safe? Today’s question: Did you go see Shaq speak at the 
O’Connell Center on Tuesday?Jury Duty
Public should leave 
Anthony jurors alone
On Tuesday, the state released the names of the jurors who acquitted Casey Anthony of first-degree murder charges. 
Why is this big news? Because it has been almost three 
months since the jury gave its verdict in the case. 
Is our country really that screwed up? Why did the judge want to grant a three-month “cooling-
off period” before the names were released? 
Because, when it comes to some rulings by the justice 
system in this country, occasionally people have the urge to whip out the torches and pitchforks. 
Yes, it’s the 21st century, but the ancient mob mentality still 
exists. 
After a jury of her peers found Anthony not guilty, social 
media went insane. People were mad, upset, frustrated, dis-traught and even sad, claiming that no justice was granted for 2-year-old Caylee Anthony. 
Nancy Grace probably fainted a couple of times. But what’s more depressing than the outcome of this trial 
is the fact that the courts showed great concern about the safety of the jurors, and rightly so, given the threats that were received. 
Did people forget that the standard for conviction in this 
country is evidence beyond a reasonable doubt? 
For all of its flaws, our court system was designed to rely 
on reason, evidence and logic to determine the guilt or inno-cence of those on trial, not revenge. 
But some out there, with no connection to the child, the 
parents or the defendant became so emotionally caught up in this case that they felt offended when the verdict was handed down. 
Part of the blame should be placed on the media for the ex-
tensive in-depth coverage and hype placed around this case. 
Yes, it is sad that a 2-year-old girl was murdered. But this 
case did not involve a crime against “society.” It involved a crime against a little girl and her family. 
The fact that it became an obsession among members of the 
media and even regular people is a little morbid and scary. 
Let us hope that this “cooling-off period” did some good, 
and that none of the jurors will be harmed in the following months. 
Whatever injustice you believe might have occurred dur-
ing this trial pales in comparison to the injustice that would occur if one of the jurors were hurt by a disgruntled observ-er.  
Many of us are called to jury duty at some point in our 
lives. There is a lot of pressure in a high-profile case like this; especially one where a person’s life hangs in the balance. 
Put yourself in their shoes before you begin to sharpen 
your pitchfork.Welfare system detracts from liberty
Charity is great. 
Good people recognize that sometimes their 
fellow peers, who are suffering, should be given 
an altruistic hand. It is the right thing to do.
Helping the poor is a wonderful and compassionate 
act that should be admired. At the same time, larceny 
should not be condoned under the guise of good inten-tions. 
One should not steal in order to offer aid to his or her 
fellow man. Then why is it OK when the federal govern-ment does it?
The farce is deplorable, especially since it occurs in 
the name of support. 
We, as people, have a moral obligation to feed those 
who starve, but we should not allow anyone to go into the business of theft. 
Republicans have been calling for reform of the wel-
fare state, yet once in power, they fail to live up to prom-ises.
There is not any difference between the two parties. 
Their names could be interchangeable on almost any pol-icy. Government coerces us to give blindly to the people, whether they deserve some form of financial assistance or if they are just individuals who cheat the system.
No one has the right to take what is yours in the name 
of charity. You sweat, bleed and labor for your earnings by being productive to feed the family or to invest in the future.
“It’s amazing to me how many people think that vot-
ing to have the government give poor people money is compassion,” said Penn Jillette, magician and fellow at the Cato Institute. “Helping poor and suffering people is compassion. Voting for our government to use guns to give money to help poor and suffering people is im-moral, self-righteous, bullying laziness.”
“Poor” people are not the only culprits who un-
dermine capitalism and the foundations of the United States. Corporate welfare is just as evil, if not worse. 
The big government bailouts of the auto industry and 
Troubled Asset Relief Fund for the banks are sinister programs that undermine the principles of capitalism. 
The protesters on Wall Street 
present legitimate complaints about the current economic sys-tem we live in. 
However, they are wrong on 
the causation as well as the so-lutions. 
Capitalism would have let 
the losers fail, plain and simple. 
The intermediate banks would have risen to the top 
to fill the void. Ford and other more profitable car manu-facturers would have swooped to take the losers’ place, reallocating resources and jobs accordingly. 
Jobs would not have been lost but dispersed among 
various companies to meet their new demands.
Sincerely ask yourself this: “Is it better to be consid-
ered ‘poor’ in a rich nation or poor in a poor country?” 
Choices have ramifications allowing us to climb up or 
fall down the ladder. The state uses aggression to main-tain the status quo. 
Mandated philanthropy is a farcical phrase for force. 
Liberty, on the other hand, gives meaning to altruistic acts. To choose something on one’s own free will is pro-foundly more potent in action and message to the recipi-ents of good deeds.  
The word “freedom” has often been thrown around 
every two to four years as rhetoric for politicians to grandly stand on “controversial” issues in order to ap-peal to the majority’s will. 
As these clowns vie for power, they tarnish the value 
of liberty. Our liberty will continue to erode with time. 
James Madison, the Father of the Constitution, once 
said, “I believe there are more instances of the abridg-ment of freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments by those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations.”

You always hear about big business screwing the little 
guy. You hear about corporations preying on the poor and uninformed. The majority of us agree that 
this happens and are seldom shocked to see it come up again and again in the news.  
It’s unfortunate, but we are resigned to the fact that the 
chips are stacked against us; that large corporations with their phalanxes of lawyers can do as they please with no consequences. This is what the Occupy Wall Street protests are about.  This is what the banking reform bills are sup-posed to be about. This is one of the many reasons why the average person is disgusted with the state of the way things are in America today.
While we all agree that big business is out to screw the 
little guy, we are nonetheless shocked when the hand of un-fairness reaches out and personally smacks us in the face with a blatant abuse of power. Such was my shock when I recently saw that Chase had stolen $96 in fees from my “Free Checking” account. “Stolen” is the exact word for what Chase did to me.  
According to dictionary.com, one of the definitions of 
“steal” is as follows: “To take (the property of another or others) without permission or right, especially secretly or by force: A pickpocket stole his watch”; a bank stole from his account.  The deceitful nature of what it did makes my blood boil.   
Back in 2009, I received a nice little postcard from Chase 
offering a $100 match if I opened a Chase account with $100 of my own money.  
A few weeks after receiving the card, I drove down to 
the bank and put $100 of my hard-earned cash into a “Free Checking Minimum Balance of $100” account as advertised on the card.  
For years my money sat in the account, and I was content 
to let it stay there, enjoying the fact that I had a Chase ac-count if I ever needed one.  Every now and then, I added to it or wrote a check against it. It wasn’t an account that I used, and I didn’t monitor it.  Why should I monitor it? The mini-mum balance was $100, and I had that more than covered. 
Fast forward to Oct. 22, 2011.I had some free time so I decided to finally get Chase on-
line banking.  When I signed on, I immediately noticed that I had three $12 service charges. “How could this be?,” I asked myself. 
I had this account for years and never did anything with 
it, and the balance always stayed the same. Why was I being charged now?  What was going on? The hand of unfairness had taken a swipe at me, and I was just begin-ning to feel the sting.  
So I call Chase and the service representative tells me that 
all the “free checking” accounts were changed over to “to-tal checking” because of “some federal regulation.” He used the phrase “some federal regulation” to describe the reason why my free checking account had turned into a money sucking succubus of an account.   
He then went on to explain the three ways that I could 
avoid the $12 service fee: 1) maintain a $1,500 balance, 2) have a direct deposit of at least $500 per month or 3) main-tain $5,000 balance across a number of different accounts, loans or mortgages with Chase.  
I went from having a “free checking cccount” that was 
required to have a $100 balance to having a “total checking account” that required a minimum balance of $1,500.  
All without my approval or say and all because of “some 
federal regulation” that had apparently forced Chase to make this change. I was starting to smell something that had the stench of a scam.  Have you ever heard the term “bait and switch?” Well if not, here is a form of it. After my pro-tests, the service representative agreed to refund the three charges and we hang up. Nice guy.
So now I immediately go back to my online statements 
and, upon further examination of the crime that Chase com-mitted against me, I now see that the original three charges are just the tip of the iceberg. The charges began all the way back in March of this year.  It has been steadily charging me $12 each and every month since March for a total of eight. 
I call back. I’m angry. I’ve been cheated. My pocket has 
been picked.  
I speak with a service representative who listens for a 
good while and then passes me on to a supervisor who in-forms me that Chase sent me a notice of the change. I ask where the notice was sent, and she does not tell me. I ask why the change wasn’t emailed to me.  She says Chase sends the notifications by mail. I ask why I didn’t get a call or a text. I ask why an email with a subject line with huge font explaining that I am now liable for a $12 service fee per month wasn’t sent to me. 
Surprisingly, I didn’t get an answer. I didn’t get an answer because the answer isn’t “PC” and 
won’t show up in any of Chase’s cute commercials that it has been playing lately.  In short, the answer is that it has designed its system so this happens. It did it on purpose.  
It was banking (excuse the pun) on charging its unknow-
ing customers these fees. Chase does not gain by letting me know about the fees so it didn’t make an effort to inform me. If I didn’t finally catch it, it would have bled me dry forever with its fees until I overdrafted, and then it would have charged me for that as well. The supervisor agreed to refund four out of the eight fees that I was charged. For the four fees that Chase wouldn’t give back, which amounts to $48, it has created an outspoken critic that will tell the world forever of its crooked behavior.    
My mistake was that I trusted the original agreement that 
I had with Chase. My mistake was that I didn’t check its every move month to month and monitor them for crooked behavior. I should have treated them like a parolee with an ankle bracelet. My mistake was one of trust. Essentially Chase has shown me that it cannot be trusted and my mon-ey is not safe there. It builds walls and vaults to keep the crooks out, but what happens when the crooks are actually inside the bank?  
Chase has shown me through its actions that it will de-
fraud its clients. Chase stole $96 from me. It robbed me of this money through an elaborate scheme to draw me in with a teaser account and then switched it on me without my knowledge. It made the minimum required effort to inform me of the changes that were enacted and then sat back and began picking my pocket. The gulf between the account I signed up for ($100 minimum balance) and the account that it switched me into ($1,500 minimum balance with $12 per month service fee) is staggering. It is a crook.   
How many others have been taken by this criminal or -
ganization? How many more have been taken in similar schemes by organizations just like it? 
More importantly what can be done about it? How many 
of you were allowed to overdraft on your account more than once in a single day, allowing these crooks to tack on unbe-lievable fees? 
Why does the law allow Chase to commit these crimes 
against American citizens?  
Why are these corporations allowed to steal from us? 
They only remain in existence because our tax money bailed their over-leveraged corrupt asses out of the hole that they dug for themselves.  
I, for one, am outraged, and I don’t believe that I’m the 
only one.

“He was a little inappropriate at times, but

him, especially his doctoral degree, which sur-prised me.”
Finishing his appearance by spanking Port-

officers to “Tase that person.”

Andrew Shaw wanted to see more 
diversity in the Jewish groups at UF 
Hillel. He found it in his friends who were coming out.
Shaw is one of the creators of 
Jewish Queers and Allies, a group created for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transexual Jewish students at UF.
Jessie Pincus, 21, an advertising 
junior, is in charge of event planning for Jewish Queers and Allies. Pin-cus, who created a Facebook page for the group Oct. 7, said the group’s first meeting is being planned in the next two weeks.
“We’re a religious-based LGBT 
group; that’s what makes us so unique,” said Jeffrey Kaplan, pro-gram director for UF Hillel, the Jew-ish student center for UF.Kaplan said the group is also fo-
cused on allies, or people who are not queer or Jewish but may support the group’s values.
Pincus, who is also the Pride 
Awareness Month public relations director for Pride Student Union, said the students in the union are embracing the idea of a Jewish queer group.
Despite the support, Kaplan ad-
mits there are people who disagree with the new group’s values.
“With any religious organiza-
tion, there’s automatically a stigma between religiosity and sexuality,” he said.UF Hillel, students form 
religious LGBT groupsHaq , from page 1He hosted an impromptu dance-off
Concert is free and open to public
tivities.
“A lot of students are exposed to the various 
student-run organizations but have never been to 
any concerts unless required by a class,” Howard said. 
The point of Homecoming is to tie the UF com -
munity together, said Garrick Harding, 21, Home-coming general chairman and political science se-nior. 
The concert will showcase the CFA during 
Homecoming in a way that hasn’t been possible before, he said.
The concert is free and open to the public. People 
should bring chairs, blankets and picnic baskets. 
There will not be many chairs set up, Harding 
said.
Harding and Howard hope to make the concert 
a yearly event.sympHony , from page 1“We’re a religious-based

Sophomore tight end Gerald Christian (32) and wide receiver Robert Clark are transferring from Florida 
due to a lack of playing time. The two were teammates at Palm Beach Gardens Dwyer High.

  Coach Will Muschamp an-
nounced Tuesday that sophomores 
Gerald Christian and Robert Clark will transfer due to a lack of oppor-tunities to get on the ﬁ  eld. 
  “Both of these players have 
expressed a desire for more play-ing time and felt that it would be in their best interests to transfer,” Muschamp said in a statement. “We wish them both the best of luck and appreciate their contributions to the program.”
  Christian, a tight end, started 
three games this season and has played the majority of snaps in UF’s two-tight end sets. He was listed No. 2 on the depth chart behind sopho-more Jordan Reed. 
  The only other tight ends on the 
roster are senior William Steinmann and freshmen A.C. Leonard and Clay Burton. None of those players has caught a pass at Florida. 
  Christian has four receptions for 
72 yards and a touchdown this year, including a 45-yard score against Kentucky . He had just a single 9-yard grab during the ﬁ  ve games in which Reed was active. 
  Christian came to UF from Palm 
Beach Gardens Dwyer High, where Clark also graduated, as a four-star recruit and the No. 2 tight end in the country , according to Rivals.com. 
  As a freshman, Christian ap-
peared in eight games but did not record a stat. 
  Florida’s coaching staff experi-
mented with using him at lineback-er during the spring but eventually returned him to tight end.   The 6-foot-3, 245-pound sopho-
more’s physical presence has been lauded by Muschamp and offensive coordinator Charlie Weis this sea-son. 
  “I’m looking for an opportunity 
to play more,” Christian said in a statement. “I have no bad feelings about Florida or the coaching staff, I just want to get a fresh start and see the ﬁ  eld more.”
  After a freshman season in which 
he caught seven passes for 69 yards, including a 20-yard touchdown against Florida State, Clark was rel-egated mostly to special teams this year. 
  The wideout has appeared in 
each of Florida’s ﬁ  ve Southeastern Conference games but does not have a reception this season. 
  His most noticeable appearance 
came against Auburn on Oct. 15, when he muffed a punt with 3:03 remaining and Florida trailing by eight.   
The play was one of only two 
punt returns this season for Clark, who   came to UF as a three-star re-cruit, according to Rivals.com. 
  “I’ve enjoyed being a part of the 
Gator program, but at the same time I’m excited about future opportuni-ties to play more,” Clark said in a statement. “I will have nothing but good memories from my time in Gainesville.”

  What happened to the Gators’ swagger?
  After Florida toppled Ten-
nessee back in Week 3, fullback Trey Burton said the Gators were “bringing the swagger back to Gainesville.”
  But here we are, nearly six weeks 
later, and that swagger is nowhere to be seen.
  So where did it go?  Maybe Florida left it in Lexington, 
Ky. — the last place the defense forced a turnover.
  Back then, the Gators were rid-
ing high. They were minutes from a 4-0 start. The defense was stiﬂ  ing. The of-fense was in a groove. Every-thing was go-ing as planned. 
  But since 
the midway 
point of the third quarter against the Wildcats, the Gators have not recorded a takeaway. That’s nearly 202 minutes without stripping the ball or picking off  Somewhere along the way,

  Casey Prather entered last season with the 
expectation of evolving into the Gators’ next 
big, slashing forward in the line of Corey Brewer and Chandler Parsons.
  In a role originally meant to create scor-
ing avenues for Florida, the 6-foot-6 Prather instead found only frustrating ways to turn the ball over. 
  Lost in a concoction of bad passes, poor 
shots and freshman jitters, he poisoned his playing time down to 6.7 minutes per game. By the end of the year, he had more give-aways (18) than made ﬁ  eld goals (17).
  After just a handful of practices this year, 
coach Billy Donovan can barely recognize 
that player.
  “He’s playing his best 
basketball since he’s been here,” Donovan said.
  Rather than worrying 
about how he was go-ing to ﬁ  t into the Gators’ 
lineup, Prather, now a sophomore, looked at the 
things he could control during the offseason. He tried to cut back on the forced shots and passes and simply let the game come to him. Prather adapting to role as

THE TOM GREEN SHOW
Tuesday that he is “cautiously 
optimistic” senior quarterback John Brantley will play Satur -
day against Georgia. 
Brantley was able to do 
more in practice than Weis ex-pected, but his ability to make it through the week without ag-gravating his ankle injury is not guaranteed.  
Weis added that freshman 
Jacoby Brissett will start if Brantley is unable to play . 
Brissett ranks “slightly 
ahead” of freshman Jeff Driskel based on their performances in games and practices. 
“It’s a combination of Jacoby 
getting b e t t e r and Jeff get-
ting banged up,” Weis said. “I think that both of these young men have a very , very bright future.”
Contact Greg Luca at gluca@
alligator.org.“It’s amazing: He’s actually 
been more productive in practice, 
offensively, by taking a whole less amount of shots,” Donovan said. “Last year, just his handling, pass-ing decision-making made it very difficult for him to play on offense. … He was a turnover factory.”
Though it appears Florida 
will have no shortage of talented shooters this season, Prather isn’t including himself in that arsenal right now. He went from averag-ing 29 points per game his senior year at Jackson (Tenn.) North Side High, to 1.2 points each outing at Florida.
His .267 3-point shooting per-
centage was the lowest on the team of any player who attempted a shot behind the arc, and he also never made it to the free-throw line in 222 minutes on the court. But he’s not concerned with either this year.
“It’s kind of easy now since 
we’ve got so many other scorers,” Prather said. “I really don’t have to do as much.”
Instead, Prather can focus on 
filling the rebounding void left by Florida’s departed frontcourt.  In a four-guard set, which Donovan has hinted at using, Prather said he could play any position from shooting guard to power forward. 
With one big man on the court, 
Prather would have the chance to provide a larger impact on the boards than he did bringing in 1.1 rebounds per game last season. 
“These guys all come out of high 
school, and they’re able to score a lot, and they can do it based on their athleticism,” Donovan said. “But when you get to this level, understanding how you’ve got to impact the game … it’s different.”
So far, Donovan said Prather 
is buying into his new role. Along with redshirt freshman Cody Lar-son, he is taking the fewest amount of shots during practice but is still being effective running the floor and moving the ball on offense.
It appears Prather is finally 
bringing something to the team neither he nor his teammates saw from him last season.
When asked what changes he 
has seen in Prather, junior guard Kenny Boynton said: “His confi-dence. 
“He’s not forcing anything. It’s 
not like he’s scoring a lot of points, but he’s taking the right shots. He’s finishing.”

if Brantley can’t play
a pass.
It’s no coincidence that during 
that same span, Florida has sur -
rendered 96 points and dropped 
three straight games.
“We need to get turnovers 
back,” defensive tackle Jaye Howard said. “We haven’t had a turnover since probably the Ken-tucky game. We have to get that back going to be successful again and give our offense a chance.
“It’s just swagger. When you 
get turnovers, you create turn-overs and your defense plays bet-ter. We have to get back to that; I haven’t seen it since Kentucky.”
After going more than 13 
quarters without a takeaway (and turning the ball over six times in the last month), Florida is 109th in the nation in turnover margin at minus-7. Only two BCS con-ference teams, Florida State and Iowa State, both at minus-8, boast a lower differential this season.
Howard knows the only cure 
for Florida’s defense is turnovers, which it will need to create this weekend to avoid a .500 record.
While the defense left its 
swagger in Kentucky, the of-fense’s was carried off the field just before halftime against Ala-bama.
When John Brantley went 
down with an ankle injury, coach Will Muschamp said it deflated the team. It has shown the last two-plus games. As star-crossed as Brantley’s career at Florida has been, this offense was only go-ing as far as he could take it this season.
Wide receiver Deonte Thomp-
son said it best during fall camp: The difference between the John Brantley of this season and the John Brantley of last season is that “his swag and confidence [are] higher than they have been in the past — just leadership and taking control of the team.”
But with Brantley out, and 
Florida “cautiously optimistic” about his availability against Georgia, the offense is still look-ing to regain the confidence it displayed the first month of the season.
So what’s going to happen 
with the Gators’ long-lost swag-ger? 
They’ll need to find it this 
weekend, or their season will be lost, too.

Florida freshman Carlie Needles is working her way into the discus-
sion at point guard alongside Jaterra Bonds and Lanita Bartley.

Playing first-year Gators at point guard may become a 
tradition for coach Amanda Butler.
Carlie Needles, a true freshman, will share point guard 
duties with senior Lanita Bartley and sophomore Jaterra 
Bonds this season, Butler said.
“Luckily, they all don’t just play one position,” Butler 
said. “(We) have three kids who can be on the floor at the same time or one at a time because of the ball pressure we’re going to be able to maintain.”
With Bartley and Bonds’ performances from last sea-
son fresh in mind, getting off to a fast start seems like a prerequisite for Gators point guards.
Bartley and Bonds made their Division I debuts last 
season and contributed right from the get-go.
After playing two seasons at Santa Fe College, Bartley 
quickly became a lineup regular, starting 33 games for Florida.
Bartley, one of five seniors on the Gators’ roster, led 
the team with 3.4 assists and 1.8 steals per game last sea-son.
“We were always on her last year about being more 
vocal, being in charge and not second-guessing herself,” Butler said. “She realized very quickly last year that [pass-ing] was an area that was a little bit of a deficit for us.”Meanwhile, Bonds was a key player coming off the 
bench, ranking second on the team with 9.9 points and 2.5 assists per game last season.
Bonds’ efforts earned the 5-foot-6 guard a spot on the 
2010-11 Southeastern Conference All-Freshman squad.
But the transition to Florida may be more difficult for 
Needles than it was for her point guard counterparts.
While Needles grew up two time 
zones away in Highlands Ranch, Colo., Bartley hails from Jacksonville, and Bonds is a graduate of P .K. Yonge 
High in Gainesville.
“Knowing that (senior center Aza-
nia Stewart) and the other two fresh-men are internationals, I knew that me just going 4,000 miles away from home wasn’t going to be as big of a 
deal,” Needles said.
On media day Oct. 12, Needles acknowledged that 
her main concern was getting a handle on offensive plays and defensive strategy.
However, Butler has praised Needles’ toughness and 
intelligence and was impressed by “how quickly she picks up on things.”  
“She’s ready for what’s next and really has a great re-
silient spirit,” Butler said, “which is important for a point guard and really important for a freshman.” Freshman Needles vying for playing
