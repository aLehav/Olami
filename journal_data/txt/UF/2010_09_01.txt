� THE PLANT IS SCHEDULED FOR 
BUILDING BEGINNING IN DECEMBER.
By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER
Alligator Writer
The fate of a planned biomass power 
plant that will create electricity by inciner -
ating wood waste may be left to the state’s 
Supreme Court.
Dian Deevey and Paula Stahmer, 
Gainesville citizens, filed a motion to ap-peal the 3-2   decision of the Public Ser -
vice Commission to allow the building of a biomass plant in northwest Gainesville.  
Stahmer said the project could potentially bankrupt the city and and hurt the environ-ment.
Construction on the plant, which will be 
built and run by American Renewables, is 
scheduledto begin in December, but it the plant must clear challenges from residents.  
The first challenge is the Public Service 
Commission’s decision on whether or not the city needs to build another power plant. The first hearing was in March, and there was another hearing in May. 
Stahmer said during the process 
Gainesville Regional Utilities and city officials, admitted there is not a need for a new energy source until 2023.  
But  GRU spokeswoman Kim Jamerson said that depends on a scenario in which all of GRU’s power plants, including reserves, are in operation at once.
If that were to happen, she said, the 
rates of electricity for customers would be high because the backup plants are costlier to run.
She said the proposed biomass plant 
would provide increased reliability.
The second challenge to the plant get-
ting a site certification permit. Former Gainesville Mayor Thomas Bussing chal-lenged the permit on the basis that the plant would create harm the environment.
The hearing ended last Friday, but no 
ruling has been delivered. 
Potentially dangerous plant emissions 
are among the top concerns of the biomass 
opponents, said Josh Levine, the plant proj-
ect manager.
According to a press release from the 
Anti-Biomass Incineration and Forest Pro-
tection Campaign, Tallahassee asthma specialist Dr. Ron Saff said emissions from biomass plants can cause asthma, heart 
attacks and cancer.
But Levine said there are measures in 
place to prevent toxic emissions, including a monitor in the smokestack that continu-ously records the contents. The results from the monitor will be reported to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. 
Another concern of biomass opponents 
is the type of wood the plant will use.Levine said four types of wood would 
be used. One of the types is forest residues, or timber leftovers, including tree tops, branches and unwanted tree trunks. The timber industry, he said, normally stacks this wood and burns it in open fields. 
Another type is urban wood waste, 
which residents and other businesses clean up, normally collected by the city and thrown into landfills.
Wood will also come from mill residue 
and opportunity fuels, which are the trees out of urban areas that are downed by storms and also some that are cut down to prevent forest fires.
Opponents of the biomass plant say they 
fear that in order to obtain wood waste, col-lectors would go into the forest and pick up loose biomass. This would disrupt the natural decomposition processes of the for -
ests.
Fla. Supreme Court may hear biomass case
STUDENT GOVERNMENT
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
The Student Senate passed a resolution during Tuesday 
night’s meeting condemning the Dove World Outreach 
Center’s planned burning of the Quran on Sept. 11.
The resolution, which passed unanimously, was au-
thored by Student Alliance Senator Kevin Kleponis, who was pleased to see widespread support for it.
“I think it’s something we can all be 
proud of,” he said.
Student Body President Ashton 
Charles, who represents the Unite Party, 
also noted the importance of the resolu-
tion during her report to the chamber.
It needs to be known that Student 
Government is not tolerant of people who 
want to burn the Quran, she said.
The Senate also passed a resolution honoring two UF 
students, Lamar Abel and William Belt Courtney III, who died over the summer.
Senators held a moment of silence after the passage of 
the bill.Student Senate

French documentary producer Matthieu Fauroux and cameraman Aurélien Chapalain talk to UF 
Student Body Treasurer Virlany Taboada. 
� HE WILL FOLLOW STUDENTS 
AND ATHLETES.
By SILVIA FERNANDEZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
He came all the way from France to 
experience an American college cam-
pus, but he didn’t expect all the food. 
“In France, there is usually one big 
boring restaurant for students to eat 
at,” Matthieu Fauroux said.  “[Here] 
people are snacking all the time. The ‘freshman 15,’ I believe it.” 
Fauroux, a  staff reporter for TF1, a 
major French television station, trav-eled all the way to the U.S.  to film a documentary about UF.
He has been exploring campus — 
and sampling Gainesville restaurants 
— since Aug. 17,   following students 
and athletes in an attempt to capture the essence of The Gator Nation. 
“I want to introduce the French au-
dience to an American campus,” Fau-roux said.
Fauroux said he chose UF because 
of its national and international recog-nition for academics and athletics. 
“Everything is at the highest level in one place. It’s so exciting for us,” Fauroux said. 
He said he has been focusing part 
of his documentary on French students at UF and exploring the opportunities available to them.
Fauroux said UF is a renowned 
school in France. He and his camera-man, Aurelien Chapalain, have until Sept. 12 to complete the documentary. 
“It has been a dream for a long time 
to work abroad,” Fauroux said. 
American and French universities 
are very different, he said. Fauroux and Chapalain get lost on UF’s sprawling campus every day . 
He said he’s also had a hard time 
finding a parking spot. 
The 85-minute documentary will 
cost at least 50,000 euros to produce and will only be shown in France; 
however, UF students will be able to 
order a limited number of DVDs upon request. 
Fauroux said the Gainesville com-
munity has been very welcoming and willing to help him with his film. Com-pared to some of his French sources, UF students are not at all camera shy . “Everyone opened their door,” Faur -
oux said. French documentarist captures Gator Nation on film
A Student Alliance Party senator resigned
Sen. Jonathan Ossip, of the Stu-
dent Alliance, announced his res-
ignation from the Senate and from 
his post as leader of his party.
In a letter sent to the Alliga-
tor Tuesday afternoon, Ossip ex-
plained that while he only had four weeks until the end of his term, he still felt compelled to leave in the wake of new emerg-ing leaders in his party and the re-
emergence of the Progress Party 
and a three-party race.
“Emotionally, I refuse to put 
myself through another three-par -
ty race,” he wrote. “I only hope 
and pray that leaders from the Student Alliance and Progress can 
sit down and resolve their differ -
ences, instead of letting animosity fester in the silence.”
The Senate also approved seven 
assistant supervisors of election ap-pointments, as well as four election commission seat appointments.SENATE , from page 1 The next hearing will

HUMAN RIGHTS

Next time a student buys a Gator T-shirt, 
he may be helping Maritza Vargas, who, at 
45, has her own bedroom and bathroom for the first time. 
Seven months ago, the largest university 
and college logo apparel supplier, Knights Apparel, opened a factory in Alta Gracia, Dominican Republic, where workers are paid three and a half times more than the legal minimum wage in an effort to ensure they and their families have adequate hous-
ing, food and an opportunity for an educa-
tion. 
“It was impossible for me to save up 
enough for all that before,” said Vargas, a union leader at the factory. “If I could save 
up enough money for the rent and food, that 
would be a good week.”
At the factory, about 125 workers pro-
duce T-shirts and fleeces for more than 400 U.S. universities, including UF. 
Students will be able to purchase the ap-
parel starting in mid-September at the UF Bookstore.
T-shirts will sell for about $18 and fleeces 
for about $35.  
UF Amnesty International President 
Daniel Wolfe is confident the apparel will be popular among students.
“The clothes look the same, but if stu-
dents look deeper, they will realize that they should buy clothing from Alta Gracia as op-posed to from other companies,” he said. According to Knights Apparel CEO Jo-
seph Bozich and the company’s President Donnie Hodge, workers at the factory are paid about $500 a month as opposed to $147, the minimum wage in the Dominican Republic.
They work 40-hour weeks and also re-
ceive benefits such as a pensions, vacations and coverage for severance. 
The idea for the factory was both a per -sonal and a business decision for Bozich and 
Hodge. 
“Yes, we have shareholders and yes, we 
need to make a profit, but we also believe 
that we have a responsibility to better the lives of the people we touch,” Bozich said.   
The factory is named Alta Gracia, after 
the town in which it was built. Translated, “alta” means higher and “gracia” means grace, or to aspire to a higher feeling. 
“The actual meaning of the town, we 
thought, is appropriate for the project we are trying to do,” Bozich explained. 
“I know that if I wanted to buy a Gator 
T-shirt, and this one brand in the store had some redeeming social quality that will make someone’s life better, I will make that choice,” she said.UF T-shirt, fleece supplier pays workers living wages

Student Alliance president UF RESEARCHERS FOUND 
ENZYMES THAT CAN MAKE FUEL FOR CARS. 
By MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Contributing Writer
A tiny bug could help solve 
one of the world’s biggest prob-
lems.
UF researchers have found 
two enzymes in termite saliva 
that help break down wood into sugars that the bioenergy indus-
try can use to produce fuel for 
cars.
The paper was published on 
the Internet in “Insect Biochem-
istry and Molecular Biology” in 
August.
“Ten years ago, when I saw 
the first genes, I knew this was the way to go,” said Mike Scharf, 
UF associate professor of ento-
mology and the leader of the re-search.
Scharf said the enzymes in 
the termites’ saliva break apart lignin, a tough part of wood’s composition that is usually very expensive to eliminate. 
Scharf is proposing using the 
enzymes instead of strong acids and bases or the intense, costly heat of 100 degrees Celsius to break down the lignin. The enzymes can do the same 
job at room temperature, al-though they work best at body temperature.
Termites change wood into 
something their bodies can use: sugar.
“The analogy we use is a ter -
mite candy bar,” Scharf said while holding up a block of pine 
wood. “It’s no different than a 
human candy bar in terms of sugar content.”
He said that sugar could then 
be sent to a bioenergy plant 
where it would 
be fermented to make the alco-holic fuel known 
as ethanol.
James Pres-
ton, a UF micro-
biology profes-
sor who studies 
bacterial enzymes and how they 
can be used to break down plants into alternative fuels, said the greatest barrier to ethanol pro-
duction is removing the lignin, 
but these enzymes could make the process cheaper by reducing the time and energy needed to do 
the job.
“After all, what are enzymes? 
They’re catalysts,” Preston said. 
“They make things go fast.”
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — Opposed to the war 
from the start, President Barack Obama on 
Tuesday formally ended the U.S. combat role in Iraq as promised, declaring: “It is time to 
turn the page.” He said the nation’s most ur -
gent priority must be fixing its own economy.
In his prime-time speech to the nation, 
Obama said the United States “has paid a 
huge price” to give Iraqis the chance to shape their future. That toll has included more than 4,400 dead, tens of thousands of troops wounded and hundreds of billions of dollars spent since March 2003.
“Ending this war is not only in Iraq’s inter -
est — it is in our own,” Obama said.
Yet for all the finality , the war is not over, 
and the American sacrifice will continue. Obama is keeping up to 50,000 troops in Iraq for support and counterterrorism training, and the last forces are not due to leave until the end of 2011 at the latest. Still, he sought to mark Aug. 31, 2010, as a milestone in one of the defining chapters in recent American 
history.
In a telling sign of the domestic troubles 
weighing on the U.S., Obama reserved part of 
his war address to campaign for his efforts to revitalize the economy.
On a night focused on his role as com-
mander in chief, he said his “central respon-sibility as president” was to get people back to work.
The ending of the combat mission on this 
date had been known for 18 months. Given the stakes, the toll in American lives and dol-lars and the long consuming debate, Obama sought to explain it to the country.
“Operation Iraqi Freedom is over, and the 
Iraqi people now have lead responsibility for the security of their country,” Obama said. He 
made sure to remind the nation that he had 
promised to meet this goal and shrink U.S. in-volvement by now, “and that is what we have done.”
Obama’s rise to the presidency was built 
in part on his fierce opposition to the war, an American-led endeavor that lost public sup-port as it rolled on and American casualties rose. Obama has long held that the war in-
flamed anti-American sentiments abroad and 
stole resources from the fight in Afghanistan.
In a defense of his foreign policy, Obama said capping the combat mission in Iraq would send a message to the world that the U.S. “intends to sustain and strengthen our leadership.”
Obama sought to close a divisive chapter 
without declaring victory.
His opposition to the war presented him 
with a tricky moment — standing firm in his position without disparaging the sacrifice and courage of those who fought.
On Tuesday he was intent on assuring the 
nation and the stretched military that all the work and bloodshed in Iraq was not in vain, declaring that because of it “America is more secure.”
Though the U.S. commitment in Iraq is 
winding down, Obama is sending more troops to Afghanistan, the home base of the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaida terrorists, where Americans have been fighting for nearly nine years.
“It is going to be a tough slog,” Obama said 
of Afghanistan in remarks earlier Tuesday to soldiers at Fort Bliss, Texas. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said success in Afghanistan was 
possible but “is not inevitable.”
Tuesday night, the president’s speech was 
never intended to be celebratory.
“It’s not going to be a victory lap,” Obama 
said at Fort Bliss, a post that has lost 51 sol-
diers in the Iraq war. “It’s not going to be self-congratulatory . There’s still a lot of work that we’ve got to do to make sure that Iraq is an effective partner with us.”
Since the war began, more than 4,400 U.S. 
troops have been killed and almost 32,000 
have been wounded. 4, ALLIGATOR  WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 2010

DALLAS (AP) — Gay couples legally 
married in other states cannot get a di-
vorce in Texas, where same-sex marriage is 
banned, a state appeals court ruled Tues-
day.
The 5th Texas Court of Appeals ruled 
that a Dallas district court judge didn’t 
have the authority to hear a divorce case 
involving two Dallas men who married in Massachusetts in 2006. Republican state Attorney General Greg Abbott’s office had appealed after Judge Tena Callahan, 
a Democrat, said she did have jurisdiction 
and dismissed the state’s attempt to inter -
vene.
“Today’s court of appeals decision over -
ruled the district court’s improper ruling, confirmed the constitutionality of Texas’ traditional definition of marriage and correctly found that Texas courts lack the legal authority to grant divorces to same-
sex couples,” said Abbott spokesman Jerry 
Strickland.
Callahan also had ruled Texas couldn’t 
limit marriage to a man and a woman, but the appeals court said the state’s same-sex 
marriage ban was constitutional.
“A person does not and cannot seek a 
divorce without simultaneously asserting 
the existence and validity of a lawful mar -
riage,” Justice Kerry P. Fitzgerald wrote on behalf of three Republican appeals court justices. “Texas law, as embodied in our constitution and statutes, requires that a valid marriage must be a union of one man 
and one woman, and only when a union 
comprises one man and one woman can there be a divorce under Texas law.”
The appeals court ordered the case be 
sent back to Callahan, who must vacate her order.
The men, known only as J.B. and H.B. 
in court filings, separated amicably two years after getting married.
J.B.’s attorney, Peter Schulte, has said 
the two men had no children and weren’t arguing over how to divide their property, but wanted an official divorce. Schulte said 
Tuesday they had not yet decided whether 
to appeal to the Texas Supreme Court.
“We obviously disagree with the jus-
tices’ ruling, but we respect the process and respect the court,” Schulte said.
Abbott’s office had argued before the 
three-judge appeals court in April that the couple was not eligible for a divorce in Texas because the state didn’t recognize 
their marriage. Jody Scheske, another law-
yer for J.B., argued his client was entitled to a divorce because he had a valid mar -
riage.
The appeals court agreed with Abbott 
that such unions could be dissolved by having the marriage declared void.
Among the reasons J.B. argued for a 
divorce rather than a voidance was that 
spousal support and community property 
laws only apply in divorce cases. The ap-peals court said those issues are policy arguments that must be addressed by the 
Legislature.“It’s deeply disappointing to see courts 
deny same-sex couples equal treatment 
under the law,” said Jennifer Pizer, a law-yer for Lambda Legal, which promotes equal rights for gay, lesbian, bisexual and 
transgender people.
Texas voters passed a constitutional 
amendment to ban same-sex marriage by a 
3-to-1 margin in 2005 even though state law already prohibited it. Kelly Shackelford, 
president of the conservative Plano-based 
Liberty Institute, said the Tuesday ruling “strikes down an activist judge’s attempt to take the law into her own hands.”
Abbott’s office also appealed a gay di-
vorce case in Austin after a judge there granted a divorce earlier this year to two women who married in Massachusetts in 2004. The Austin appeals court has not yet 
heard arguments in that case.
One of the women, Angelique Naylor, 
told The Associated Press in April, “We 
didn’t ask for a marriage; we simply asked 
for the courtesy of divorce.”
She referred requests for comment 
about Tuesday’s ruling to Scheske, who 
also is her attorney. Appeals court says gay couples can’t divorce in Texas
“It’s deeply disappointing to see 
courts deny same-sex couples 
equal treatment under the law.”

EDITORPaul RunnestrandStefania FerroMANAGING EDITORSJared MisnerOPINIONS EDITORHouse candidate gets stickers wrong x
Palm Beach County isn’t exactly known for its good 
voting record. 
In the 2008 presidential election, there were nu-
merous voting glitches, and in 2000 it became the center of a national controversy with its hanging chads and the 
highest support Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan ever 
had in their numerous presidential runs.
But this time, the problem isn’t with the voting 
equipment or poorly designed ballots. It’s with the can-didate.
Allen West is a conservative darling, fighting for Ron 
Klein’s 22nd District seat in the U.S. House. He spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference this year and is a member of the tea party movement. This is his 
second attempt at the seat, and the political winds are 
blowing in his favor this time.
So, in a year where feelings of anti-incumbency are 
in the air and the common political sentiment is “throw the bums out,” how could West not win in a district that only trended one percentage point higher toward Dem-ocrats than the national average in 2008?  (For those keeping score at home, that makes Florida’s 22nd Dis-trict 53 percent Democratic and 47 percent Republican.)
The answer, quite plainly, is intolerance. Just this past week, West didn’t choose to attack 
something as blatantly liberal as arugula or lattes, or something surprisingly conservative like gas-guzzling SUVs or half-pound hamburgers, but rather something that fell in the middle of the continuum of American politics — the idea of tolerance. 
West attacked a Gainesville icon — not something 
like Satchel’s or Century Tower, but the COEXIST bum-
per stickers made with different faith symbols affixed 
to cars, bikes and scooters. Now, the stickers weren’t established here and aren’t limited to just college towns, but they seem more prevalent here. My statistics profes-sor would lecture me on how I didn’t use the correct sample size and how I only sur -
veyed a few parking lots, but this is an unofficial poll, of course.
If you’ve not seen these stickers, 
here’s a quick rundown. The “C” 
is replaced by a star and crescent, 
symbolic of Islam. The “O” is re-placed by a peace sign usually, with the “E” either representing the two signs for man and woman 
combined or representing science, as in E=MC squared. The “X” is replaced by a Star of David for Judaism, the “I” is usually a Pagan or Wiccan symbol, while the “S” is usually a yin and yang combined. Finally, the “T” is 
replaced by a cross, symbolic of Christianity. Sounds 
pretty innocent, right? After all, it’s a bumper sticker, not a death threat.
Not if you’re Allen West. He believes, as he articulated to a public forum on 
March 8, people with the COEXIST bumper stickers rep-resent “something that would give away our country” and “are afraid to stand up and confront that which is the antithesis, anathema of who we are.” 
So wait, people who are not pushing a religion but 
rather the belief that it’s okay to tolerate other people are going to destroy these great United States?
West’s complaint centers on Islam (surprise!), and 
represents the Islamophobia that is sweeping the con-servative movement in America. 
Ron Klein might have just gotten a belated birthday 
gift or even worse — West’s fear mongering might have just won him those same voters who accidentally voted 
for Buchanan and Nader in 2000.
Good luck, Palm Beach.

Americans should look 
past differences
As Tennessee officials wait to declare Tuesday’s fire at 
a future Islamic center a case of arson, the nation, and particularly our very own Gainesville, face a bigger di-
lemma.
And we’re embarrassed we have to give this talk.
The recent surge of so-called “Islamophobia” has torn our 
country into an ideological bloodbath where rights to prayer are 
trounced by leftover, misplaced sentiments. 
Whether the Islamic center was turned to ashes by a woe-
fully misguided, racist arson or by a simple electrical failure will not change the current disappointing and, frankly, anti-Ameri-can religious climate in this country . 
When American Muslims are terrified to build new houses 
of worship out of the fear of religious persecution, or as it ap-
pears here, vandalism, we become no different than the reli-
gious zealots of the 1930s, ‘40s and ‘50s we   fear and analyze in history books. 
However, as obvious supporters of our First Amendment 
right to freedom of the press, we, perhaps more than most, real-ize the freedom of religion is as vital to our national pride and security as our freedom to voice our objections to anything we should disagree with. 
But how does it feel when we’re able to say the majority of 
Muslims, including the American Muslim Association of North America, are being the bigger people as they issue calls for non-violence in response to these blatant persecutions in their fight for social equality?
Grow up, America. We’re tired of your bickering. And, 
Dove, we’re not even starting with you. We just don’t have the strength.
They’re watching you
Big Brother is watching you.
No, we’re just kid-
ding about that guy. But po-lice officers are.
A recent federal court rul-
ing in California will now permit law enforcement of-ficials to place GPS devices on cars without any notice or warrant. So, yeah, they’re re-ally watching you. Driving to Mother’s? They can know. Re-turning home from that night 
of shame? Yep, they can know 
about that one, too. 
Initially used by Oregon 
Drug Enforcement Agency officials to charge and arrest a suspect in a 2007 conspiracy to grow marijuana charge, this ever-so-controversial method of gathering evidence certain-
ly opens up the mother of all 
privacy can of worms. 
This ruling comes just be-
fore another disconcerting privacy issue. Northern Ari-zona State University issued a release saying it would soon track students’ attendance via a microchip in students’ ID cards. We’re left with a sticky 
conundrum of privacy versus 
justice, but then again, we’re even scared to type that as we’re surely being watched right now. 
A former U.S. Department 
of Justice official spoke about the court’s ruling and said no one can expect privacy just 
because something is on pri-
vate property . 
After our minds stop rac-
ing trying to understand that sentence, we’re left with the analogy that not expecting privacy at a private residence is like not expecting sand at a beach. We strongly oppose 
the Ninth Circuit Court’s de-
cision as we can only hope that ruling is overturned in a hopeful appearance in front of the Supreme Court. 
In the meantime, go about 
your daily lives and just re-member ignorance is strength, war is peace and freedom is 
slavery . And two plus two 
will always equal five.

letters@alligator.orgWEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 1, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 7
You make an incalculable number of 
choices in a day . You decide whether 
to eat lunch at the underground or at 
the union.
You decide what to eat. You decide 
whether you should study for that test on 
Friday, or go out to bars instead.
I’m sure you get the idea by now. After 
college, the decisions you and I will be mak-
ing will be a bit more serious.
Take, for example, decisions we make 
about health care.
After Obama’s health care bill fully goes 
into effect, the government will possess more power than they ever have before. The more power the government possesses, the bigger 
it becomes.
The American Spectator, a conservative 
magazine, said “Government authorities 
will dictate to insurance companies exactly what health insurance they must sell, to 
whom they must sell it, and what they can 
charge.”
I get a bad vibe from this statement. 
Ask yourself this common sense question: 
Would you want government authorities to know about your medical history no matter how personal it is?
These are some of the serious decisions 
that need to be made during and after col-lege. You should have an option as to which 
health insurance to purchase. 
There is also the option to not purchase 
insurance at all or to choose when to pur -
chase it. The decision, however, shouldn’t be 
dictated to you. You probably know what is 
best for yourself.
Commenting on the health bill,  House Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi said 
“We will have to pass 
it first to know what’s 
in it.” Common sense tells me that this is a 
very sketchy statement. Exactly how is it 
beneficial, to any American, to pass a bill be-
fore we know the contents? 
Shouldn’t we, the people, know what is 
in the bill before anything happens? The bill 
might not have passed if we had known its 
contents ahead of time.
A CNN research poll taken at the end of 
March “finds that 59 percent of Americans now stand opposed to the health care legis-
lation in Congress.” There could be a slight 
fluctuation in the numbers since it was taken 
in March. Common sense dictates that we 
shouldn’t have a bill that a majority of our country is opposed to.
This bill won’t fully go into effect until 
2014, though. If it is as great as Obama claims 
it to be then it should have gone into full ef-
fect immediately . That would be the sensible 
thing to do. This should raise questions, 
since Obama’s term ends in January 2013.
Almost half of all states have filed law-
suits against the health care bill. Coons vs. 
Geithner is a new and recent lawsuit that 
was filed by the Goldwater Institute that 
claims the bill to be in violation of the First, Fourth, Fifth and Ninth Amendments.
A government with less power gives 
us the power to make important decisions 
regarding our health care and overall well-
being.

Reader questions Student Body’s 
support of diversity in light of recent Alligator poll question
As a professional engineer and prospec-
tive graduate student on the University of 
Florida campus for a single day, Aug. 30, 
I flipped through the Independent Florida 
Alligator and was shocked to read a cam-pus poll result indicating 74 percent of the students regret women were given the 
vote.  
Had the connection to a previous story 
about a women’s suffrage re-creation not 
been  explained to me by the student I was 
accompanying, I would be further appalled 
at the simple nature of the question.  
It may simply be mediocre editing that 
printed such poll results without comment or context, such as how many participat-ed.
As editor of my school news magazine, 
I would have been more circumspect in printing this statistic, realizing the impres-sion it could give of the school that the 
newspaper represents.
As a snapshot view — and especially if 
a true reflection of attitudes of the students 
at the school — this statistic speaks poorly of the Student Body at UF and nearly as poorly of the administration who is edu-
cating it. 
 It has put the question into my mind 
to wonder how I would be treated should 
I choose to attend classes at UF, a consid-
eration I had thought unnecessary in this 
age of diversity.

Government limits freedomUWire
The Tea Party Movement is an extremely vocal and 
powerful force of opposition against big government. But how much does it care about individual liberty?
To be sure, the cause of liberty in the United States has seen 
many benefits from the Tea Party movement. Glenn Beck fa-mously catapulted Friedrich Hayek’s economic and political treatise “The Road to Serfdom,” a favorite of classical liberals, to the Amazon best-seller list and even called for a non-inter -
ventionist foreign policy and cuts in military spending. Despite strong voices, no one seems to have emerged as its definitive leader. This suggests it’s a bottom-up movement driven by ideas and beliefs rather than loyalty to politicians or parties.
Most importantly, the Tea Party is one of the major forces 
pushing back on recently-passed health care legislation, finan-cial and automobile company bailouts and ill-conceived en-vironmental regulations. To the extent that the Tea Party can delay or stop increases in the size and scope of government, the movement is a potential ally for freedom.
Anyone who believes in a free society , however, should be 
skeptical of the notion that Tea Partiers truly care about indi-vidual liberty. According to a New York Times poll, 42 percent of Tea Party supporters believe we should decrease legal immi-gration, while 14 percent favor increas-ing it. Four in 10 believe the government shouldn’t recognize the right of same-sex couples to enter into marriage-like 
contracts. The Tea Party is largely focused on economic issues, but if the Tea Party becomes more influential it may have to deal with social issues — potentially leading to a fracture.
I’m also suspicious of the Tea Party’s opposition to govern-
ment spending and deficits. Tea Partiers overwhelmingly re-port wanting to reduce the size of government, but it’s impor -
tant to remember that arguments against the recent health care reform law often came with a plea not to touch Medicare. The Tea Party is adopting an odd “keep the government away from Medicare” attitude, in which they claim to oppose government spending but are surprisingly protective of the entitlement pro-grams that are most likely to lead us to fiscal ruin.
The Tea Party’s strong stance on opposing increases in the 
size and scope of government resonates with me. But I haven’t heard much to suggest that the Tea Party would be in favor of taking limited-government principles to their logical conclu-sion, which is to oppose intrusive government largess wher -
ever it occurs. A true limited-government worldview would scrutinize government regulations not only of businesses and the environment, but also marriage and immigration. Econom-ically speaking, if Tea Partiers want to be serious about govern-ment spending, they have to be willing to put Medicare, Social Security and defense spending on the chopping block.
Going into November, Republicans will inevitably court the 
Tea Party vote, hoping to ride the wave of anti-Obama senti-ment. If Tea Partiers want to remain principled small-govern-ment activists, they should be suspicious. Republicans would love to use the Tea Party for its own political ends, but an honest look at the GOP track record shows they’re not serious about limited government — remember Medicare expansions and exploding deficits under Bush? If the Bush years showed us anything, it was that the Republican Party is not the party of small government. The Tea Party should “refudiate” the GOP if it wants to be serious about government spending.
As of now, I’m willing to work with — and have worked 
with — Tea Partiers on opposing big government. But until they can show me that they are serious about principles of small government and individual freedom, I can’t count my-self as one of them.

POLL RESULTS TEEING OFF WITH TYLER JETT QUOTABLEBy MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator.org
 
Andre Debose never wanted to be 
“the next Percy Harvin.” 
He wanted to blaze his own path, 
and that just got easier to do.
Rather than play in the slot — Har -
vin’s former position — with Chris 
Rainey, Debose will line up on the out-side Saturday against Miami (Ohio) and back up Deonte Thompson at the X 
receiver position.
Coach Urban Meyer mentioned the 
switch Monday, and offensive coordi-
nator Steve Addazio said it was done to make Debose more versatile so he can 
see more playing time.
The reasons weren’t important to 
Debose, who’s happy to treat his new 
role like a football: just take it and run with it.
“[Coaches] really didn’t explain to 
me at all what it was, it was just, ‘We need you to play X,’” Debose said. 
“That’s the coach, and you listen to the 
coach.”
“It’s very new to me,” he added. 
“The X position is a lot of one-on-one 
matchups. I’m not involved with the 
linebackers and safeties, it’s just pretty 
much me and somebody the same size 
as me. It’s different, but I’m enjoying 
it.”
Redshirts for Orr, Trail: Florida’s 
coaches expect freshmen to contribute on the defensive line this season, but Leon Orr and Lynden Trail won’t be among them.
The pair will redshirt this year, de-
fensive line coach Dan McCarney said.
Rivals.com listed Trail as the No. 7 
weakside defensive end in the 2010 re-cruiting class and ranked Orr as the No. 
11 defensive tackle. 
“[They’re] not ready to play in the 
SEC, not ready to play winning foot-
ball,” McCarney said. “They’re both going to be really good prospects. But 
at this time, through 20-some practices 
and scrimmages, they’re not ready yet. 
“I’m really glad they’re at Florida 
and so is everybody in the program, 
but they’re not ready right now to go 
out there and play winning football.”
Moody fully healthy: Emmanuel 
Moody can finally stop worrying about 
his ankles and focus on breaking his 
opponents’ instead.
Moody said the surgery he under -went this offseason to remove bone 
spurs from his right ankle put a stop to 
the injury that plagued him in 2009.
“I don’t have pain when I run any-
more,” Moody said. “I had pain all 
throughout the season last year. It 
would limit how I practiced. Preparing for the Sugar Bowl, I sat out like four 
practices and had to give it a rest for 
a whole week. The pain was pretty se-
vere.”
His health is one of many reasons 
Moody is looking forward to this sea-son. With quarterback Tim Tebow in 
the NFL, the Gators will rely more on running backs to carry the ball, and Moody’s looking forward to working out of the I-formation.
“We never used the I last year,” Moody said. “It’ll help out a lot with just putting the defense on their toes. They won’t really know how to line 
up with us when we’re going from the 
spread to the I.”
New uniforms revealed today: Flor -
ida is one of 10 schools being outfitted 
with uniquely designed Nike Pro Com-
bat uniforms for at least one game this 
season.
The jerseys and game dates when 
they’ll be worn will be announced to-
day at 10 a.m., and the press conference 
will be carried on GatorZone.com.
Alabama, Boise State, Miami, Ohio 
State, Oregon State, Pittsburgh, Texas 
Christian, Virginia Tech and West Vir -
ginia are the other schools participat-
ing.

UF wide receiver Andre Debose will begin the season at the X receiver spot be-
hind Deonte Thompson.

Don’t try to act like you under -
stand the spread offense.
One UF student made the 
mistake of doing so in last week’s Stu-
dent Town Hall Meeting and coach Ur -
ban Meyer called him out on it.
The student was asked what he 
would do if the defense loaded the box. Meyer didn’t like his response.
“Do you play that video game?,” he 
asked the student, referring to `NCAA Football 11.’ “I bet you get your ass 
kicked in that video game.”
Let’s be real, Meyer is right.
The spread of-
fense is miscon-strued as a pass-
happy scheme that lacks a running game. This stereo-type couldn’t be 
further from the 
truth. 
Last season, the 
Gators accumulat-
ed more rushing yards than the Crim-son Tide’s pro-style scheme, which is believed to depend on the ground game.
In Meyer’s first season at UF, the 
team racked up just 1,761 rushing yards. But that number grew each season until it peaked at 3,236 yards in 2008. 
This year, the Gators will top that. 
With the loss of quarterback Tim 
Tebow, who used his legs to do much of 
his damage, UF will depend on the run-ning backs more. And there is nobody happier than Jeff Demps, Emmanuel 
Moody and Mike Gillislee. 
Demps could become the first Florida 
running back to gain 1,000 yards since 
Ciatrick Fason in 2004. The scheme 
won’t be the obstacle standing between 
him and this feat; the depth at the posi-tion will.
The Gators are expected to feature 
a rotation of three running backs, with 
Demps seeing most of the action, and 
Moody and Gillislee not too far behind him.
With a group of unproven receivers 
— Deonte Thompson’s 42-career catch-es are the most on the team —  and a Spread offense 
to prove its doubters wrong 
this season

Senior Ashlee Elliott and the Gators are hoping to become more con -
sistent throughout their games.
By JESSE SIMONTON
Alligator Writer
 
The 2010 campaign has started well for the Gators. 
They’re 4-0, they’ve allowed only one goal and a 
Gator was named Southeastern Conference Offensive 
Player of the Week twice in as many chances. 
Still, they’re unsatisfied. “We have really high expectations for this team, 
and we are working our way through getting better 
each game,” coach Becky Burleigh said.
In four games this season, the Gators have won 
four different ways. They’ve won an overtime thriller, 
a rain-soaked slugfest, a beat-down and an unsatisfy-
ing scrapper.
In each victory, Florida wanted something better. 
Better finishing. Better focus. Better results.
And, more than anything, the No. 7 Gators want 
consistency.
“We need to come out hard in every game,” cap-
tain McKenzie Barney said. “This past Sunday [when 
Florida beat San Diego State 1-0] was a big indicator. We need to make sure we come out mentally pre-
pared for every game.”
Despite the win, Sunday’s game was not one of 
the Gators finest. They came out sluggish and looked 
disinterested for much of the first half. After notch-ing a goal in the opening seconds of the second half, 
the Gators still struggled with execution and focus, 
missing at least five solid opportunities including an empty net attempt. 
Burleigh was visibly frustrated after the game.
“It is time for our leadership to step up and make 
sure everyone is mentally prepared,” she said. “…We 
took too much for granted.”
The Gators’ inability to score when they’ve creat-
ed chances has been one of the biggest themes of the 
early season. Playmakers like Erika Tymrak, Taylor 
Travis and Nicky Kit have created opportunities in bunches, yet Florida has struggled to find the inside of the white nylon. 
“We’re getting a lot of attempts in the box, but 
we’re just not getting on the end of them,” senior de-fender Ashlee Elliott said.
When the Gators have scored this season, the goals 
have come in quick bursts. 
Forward Tahnai Annis scored two goals in six min-
utes Aug. 22 against UCF. And, against Florida Atlan-
tic Friday, Florida scored three goals in 10 minutes. 
However, in both games the Gators took 19 more 
shots after scoring.
“Our coaches are doing a really good job in the 
game plan ... what defenses we’ll be facing and how we need to break them down, we need to just execute 
better,” Barney said.
While the Gators are constantly pushing players 
forward to attack, they have also struggled at times this season falling into defensive lulls. If not for two fantastic saves by keeper Katie Fraine Sunday after -
noon, Florida could have lost or tied the game.
Leading 2-0 against UCF, Fraine and defender Kat 
Williamson made several key plays when the rest of the team seemed to relax. 
Elliott’s move from forward to the back line has 
seen mixed results. The senior defender has flashed 
athleticism, but she has also looked confused at 
times. 
“I’ve clearly never played there and it has been 
evident,” she said. “I like center back, but it is a tough transition because I put so much pressure on my-self.”Undefeated Gators still looking for consistency

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
DAVIE — The Miami Dolphins know 
exactly how long they have until the 
opening game, thanks to coach Tony 
Sparano’s new countdown clock hang-ing in the locker room.
This year, when the season starts, 
Sparano wants his team ready for a change.
“It has been a point of emphasis,” 
safety Yeremiah Bell said. “It’s in the locker room for everybody to see.”
The Dolphins started 0-3 last year 
and 0-2 in 2008. Otherwise, their record the past two seasons is 18-9.
Miami has lost four openers in a row 
and will try to end that streak Sept. 12 at Buffalo.
“You can’t just stand in front of the 
players and say, ‘Look, we’re going to have a fast start against the Buffalo 
Bills,’” Sparano said. “There’s more to 
it than that. It’s about how we practice, it’s about being prepared and feeling like your team is fresh enough and ef-
ficient enough as you approach that first 
game.”
After last season, Sparano looked at 
every aspect of the offseason and train-ing camp routine, and the third-year 
coach made changes he thought would 
improve the chances of playing well early. 
Among the issues deliberated: how 
much time to give players off during the winter, how often to wear pads in train-ing camp, when to hold practice inside 
or out in the sun, and how to divvy up 
snaps.
With the regimen tweaked, Sparano 
believes the Dolphins are fresher as the season approaches, yet also in better 
condition.
“My first year here we could barely 
get through some of these practices,” 
Sparano said. “They’re starting to finish 
them at a much better pace.”
One challenge during two-a-days 
was to strike a balance 
between practicing 
in sweltering sum-
mer sunshine or in the team’s air-conditioned indoor bubble, where the artificial surface 
can take a toll.
“When I take the 
players inside, they don’t really love 
being inside all the time because of that 
surface on their body,” Sparano said. 
“But when you take them outside, they don’t really love being outside because of (the) heat.”
For years, South Florida’s steamy 
weather gave the Dolphins a substantial early-season home-field advantage, but that hasn’t been the case in recent years. Since 2006 they’re 2-11 in September.
Being acclimated to the subtropi-
cal heat won’t be a big factor this year, because the Dolphins’ first two home games are at night. Their first daytime game at home isn’t until Oct. 24.
So to start fast, the Dolphins must 
focus on simply playing well. One goal 
will be limiting typical early-season 
mistakes.
“When you have lax communications 
and mental errors early in the season, it causes a lot of problems,” Bell said. 
“You put in a knucklehead play here 
and there, and it sets you back.”
The Dolphins know that from recent 
experience. They dug a hole last year by 
losing their first three games and never 
recovered, finishing 7-9.
Quarterback Chad Pennington started 
those first three games before a shoulder 
injury ended his season. He remembers 
the mood around the team then and said winning early is much better.
“It builds confidence, a little bit of 
synergy and a sense of accomplishment to where you can go forward and not live in a world of negativity,” Penning-ton said.
Hence, the clock. Sparano came up 
with the idea last spring to create a sense of urgency.
“It kind of reminds me of college,” 
said quarterback Chad Henne, a former 
Michigan star. “I know Ohio State has a 
clock counting down to Michigan every year.
“It’s great. It just reminds us that it’s 
not getting further away, it’s getting closer.”Dolphins hope to avoid slow start
quarterback that has yet to make a start, Meyer will have to rely on his group of backs and an experienced 
offensive line.
The line will consist of four seniors 
and one junior when the Gators face 
Miami (Ohio) on Saturday, includ-
ing the offense’s leader, center Mike 
Pouncey.
The spread offense can adjust to 
the personnel. For example, when Tebow is at UF, the coaches used a 
bunch of quarterback runs.
“It’s hard for me to define the term 
spread,” offensive coordinator Steve 
Addazio said. “We have taken that thing and twisted it and turned it a 
lot of different ways.”
It doesn’t just consist of one par -
ticular style. The goal of the scheme 
is to put top-caliber athletes in space 
and let them work. 
And that’s exactly what’s going to 
happen this season.
With Percy Harvin, Tim Tebow 
and Aaron Hernandez gone, the run-ning backs are the only skill position 
players left from the 2008 national championship team.
Now it’s their time to become the 
focal point of the offense.ANTHONY , from page 14“This past Sunday [when Florida beat San 
Diego State 1-0] was a big indicator. We 
need to make sure we come out mentally

 THE JUNIOR RUSHED FOR 
1,658 YARDS IN 2009
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. – Mark In-
gram’s run for a second Heisman 
Trophy has been put on hold, and possibly even derailed, before the 
Alabama tailback had a chance to gain a single yard.
Ingram will miss No. 1 Ala-
bama’s opener against San Jose State 
after injuring his left knee late in 
practice Monday, coach Nick Saban 
said Tuesday.
Saban said in a statement the star 
tailback had an arthroscopic proce-
dure and should make a full recov-
ery in a “relatively short time.”
“Mark will definitely be out for 
this week’s game against San Jose State and we will manage this on 
a week to week basis beyond this 
week,” Saban said.
If the absence proves short-lived, 
it figures to have more of an impact on Ingram’s bid to join Ohio State 
running back Archie Griffin as the 
only two-time Heisman winner than 
it does on Alabama’s hopes for a re-
peat national title.
San Jose State went 2-10 last sea-
son, but the Crimson Tide face a much stiffer test in the second week 
of the season. No. 19 Penn State vis-
its Tuscaloosa on Sept. 11, then Ala-bama travels to Duke.
Alabama does have a talented 
backup in sophomore Trent Rich-ardson, who ran for 751 yards and 
scored eight touchdowns last sea-son, including 109 yards and a 49-yard touchdown against Texas in the national title game.
He and Ingram were picked as the preseason first-team all-South-eastern Conference tailbacks.
Ingram became Alabama’s first 
Heisman winner as a sophomore af-
ter rushing for a school-record 1,658 
yards and catching 32 passes.
If he misses more than one 
game, it could allow players such 
as Ohio State quarterback Terrelle 
Pryor, Boise State quarterback Kel-
len Moore or Virginia Tech tailback Ryan Williams — or someone else 
— to get a head start on him in the Heisman race.
Then again, the emergence of 
Richardson and a diverse offense that also includes standout receiver 
Julio Jones might have hindered In-
gram’s chances to repeat anyway.
Asked Monday if he thought 
Alabama could have two 1,000-yard rushers, Ingram said: “Yeah, definitely. I think it’s a definite pos-
sibility , but our main goal is to do whatever we can to help this team 
win. We’re not really focused on 
stats. We’re focused on executing 
our assignments, playing the best 
football we’re capable of playing 
week in and week out and help this 
team win games. Stats really [aren’t] an issue or something we’re focused 
on.”
There’s not much experience 
behind Richardson while Ingram is out. Redshirt freshman Eddie Lacy 
is listed as the third-teamer.
