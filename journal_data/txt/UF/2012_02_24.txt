  Like other college students facing midterms, 
Santa Fe junior Laura Putlek has a project and pa-per due this week, two exams and two lab practi-cals.
  While there’s no cure for her stress overload, 
Putlek, 21, focuses with the help of an amphet-amine called Adderall, which treats attention deﬁ  -cit hyperactivity disorder.
  But unlike many students who abuse the drug 
as a study aid, Putlek has a prescription for it.
  Although Adderall has become a popular recre-
ational drug for college students, there are healthi-er ways to cope with exam stress, said E. Maureen 
Miller, coordinator for alcohol and other drug pre-
vention at GatorWell Health Promotion Services.  This includes having a planner to keep track 
of assignments, getting enough sleep, exercising, eating healthy food and knowing the syllabus to 
prevent cramming, she said.
  “It’s the basic things, but I know a lot of times 
it’s easy to forget when students are caught up on 
having so much to do,” she said. “Planning can help when they get to that point.”
  If students have no choice but to cram during 
crunch time, Miller suggests following this rule: For every 50 minutes spent studying or writing, take a 10-minute break.
  These habits can’t be replaced by any drug.  “[Students] go on to graduate school, get a job 
and still there will be those things they have to deal with,” she said. “That’s why it’s really important to develop these healthy coping strategies now in-stead of relying on something like this.”  Adderall no substitute for 
good study habits, experts say� TWO WERE ARRESTED IN THE  
MURPHREE PARKING LOT.

Ahmad Salam doesn’t know exactly 
what sparked violence in the Murphree 
parking lot Thursday morning, but he has 
a guess.
Two students were assaulted by four 
men shortly after 2 a.m. 
The attackers were arrested on a charge 
of disorderly conduct. The instigator was familiar: alcohol.
Salam and his friend, Vishal Singh, were 
waiting to be picked up 
in the parking lot after 
spending the night at Grog 
House Bar and Grill. 
Four strangers ap-
proached, one yelling at Salam and Singh for no 
apparent reason. Then the strangers attacked.
Erick J. Medina, 21; Frederick V . Me-
dina, 22; Winston M. Frye Aranda, 22; and 
Michael L. Frye Aranda, 23, were charged Campus ﬁ  ght leads to arrests

A former intern at Harper’s Bazaar ﬁ  led a 
class-action lawsuit in regard to her unpaid 
work from August to December 2011.
The New York Times reported that the for-
mer intern, Xuedan Wang, said the women’s magazine violated federal and state wage laws by not paying her. Wang, 28, worked full-time for the company during her internship.Adrienne Wells, assistant director for ex-
periential education at UF’s Career Resource Center, said she recommends that companies offering internships follow wage and hour guidelines when hiring students.
“If there is an immediate beneﬁ  t to the 
company, then they should pay their interns,” she said.
An immediate beneﬁ  t is one the company 
could proﬁ  t from, Wells said.
For example, if students intern at a mar-keting company and work with clients, then they should be paid for their work because the company could eventually proﬁ  t from the cli-ent’s business.“As far as internships go, you are not sup-
posed to derive beneﬁ  t from having your in-terns there,” said Michelle Bedoya-Barnett, partner at the Jacksonville labor and employ-ment law ﬁ  rm Alexander Degance Barnett. “If you are deriving beneﬁ  t, you have to be pay-ing them. It is not free labor.”
She said a major red ﬂ  ag in the case of the 
Harper’s intern would be if the intern worked extensive hours. That would indicate that the intern had become indispensable.
“If you have a supervisor or are getting 
credit for the internship, there is a lot more le-Lawsuit sparks discussion of legality of unpaid internships

After about three months of 
searching for a replacement for for -
mer Commissioner Rodney Long, 
who resigned in December, the Ala-chua County Commission no longer 
has an empty seat.
The newest member of the com-
mission is moving from a pulpit to 
another kind of platform.
Winston Bradley, 71, who is a 
pastor at a church he formed six years ago, was appointed to the commission by Gov . Rick Scott on Feb. 17.
He will serve until November 
when three seats on the County Commission, including his, will be filled through an election.
Bradley is a Gainesville native. 
He is married and has two grown children who have since moved away.
Born and raised in Gainesville, 
he played basketball and football on the dirt roads in his neighborhood in northwest Gainesville and loved do-ing handy work around the house.
He went to college at Bethune-
Cookman University in Daytona Beach. He taught eighth grade social studies for a year, then joined the Air Force for four years. He served 
in Cambodia during the Vietnam 
War.
Bradley then worked as a techno-
logical supervisor for NASA’s space program at the Kennedy Space Cen-ter. After, he worked as an insur -
ance agent for Allstate Insurance for 20 years. He retired from selling insurance in 2000.
Bradley started a nondenomina-
tional church called Kingdom Life Ministries in southeast Gainesville. He has been the pastor since its in-ception and will continue his work there while serving on the commis-
sion.
Three years ago, Bradley cut off the top of his index finger while he 
was sawing a piece of wood. He said he stayed calm, drove himself to the hospital and sat in the waiting room until a doctor saw him.
“I am a very relaxed guy,” he 
said. “People think I am really seri-
ous because I don’t smile too much, 
but once you get to know me, you’ll see that I keep an open mind.”
Most of his easygoing nature 
comes from his spirituality, he said.
Bridgette Lewis, a 46-year-old 
Gainesville resident and member of Bradley’s church, said she is proud her pastor gets to sit on the commis-
sion. She said he will bring a voice to 
the voiceless.“He is very helpful and very in-
sightful,” Lewis said. “And he will talk to absolutely anybody and help them with their problems.”     
County Commissioner Paula 
DeLaney said Bradley’s financial background will be helpful to the 
commission, especially while it’s 
planning the budget.
“He dealt with lot of numbers 
when he sold insurance, and a lot of times that’s the hard stuff to wrap your arms around,” DeLaney said.
She has known Bradley for 20 
years. She said she supported him when he ran unsuccessfully for the 
Alachua County School Board in 
1992 and 1996.
Along with his professional du-
ties, Bradley has served on public committees. For the last 13 years, he has served on the Santa Fe Col-lege Board of Trustees. Bradley also served on the Gainesville Housing Authority board for 12 years.
“No matter where I am, I pride 
myself on honesty and integrity ,” he said.
Though he came onto the com-
mission with no specific agenda, Bradley said he hopes to work to create more opportunity for busi-nesses to set up shop in Gainesville.
By sifting through county codes 
and ordinances, he said he wants to find what is stifling businesses from thriving in the city and the county .     
“I appreciate this honor that has 
been put in front of me,” he said. “I want things to run smoothly , and I want to protect citizens. We’ve got to be good stewards for the county.”    4, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 2012

The Gator Nation recently showed its 
social media presence to the judges of an 
online contest.
UF was announced Thursday as 
a finalist for the 2012 #College Shorty 
Award.  The announcement came after 
243 people tweeted why UF should win the fourth annual social media contest. One tweet per person counted as a vote.
The Shorty Awards Academy mem-
bers will review finalists’ social media along with tweeted votes. Winners will be announced March 26.
UF had the third-highest number of 
votes. Butler University’s mascot won the popular vote with 412 votes. Queens University of Charlotte was second with 393 votes.
The #College Shorty Award is given 
to an accredited college that uses social media to engage students and demon-strate spirit, according to its website.
Katherine Madrid, 19, tweeted a vote 
for UF “because the Gator Nation is EV -
ERYWHERE … including Twitter!”
Madrid, a criminology and psychol-
ogy sophomore, said UF’s social media keeps students informed easily.
UF has Facebook, Google+, Four -
square, YouTube and Instagram ac-counts managed by Bruce Floyd, social media specialist in UF’s marketing and communications department.
“I feel like our social media accounts 
reflect our fans.” he said. “It’s not neces-sarily about what I’m doing but the con-versations we have with our fans.”UF finalist in Twitter contest� STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC

One Regional Transit System mechanic 
joined eight members of Students for a Demo-cratic Society in Tigert Hall on Thursday as 
they asked the UF administration to support 
bus drivers’ contract negotiations.
Because UF students make up about 75 
percent of RTS ridership, UF President Bernie 
Machen’s support could influence negotia-tions, said Students for a Democratic Society lead organizer Conor Munro.
Jamal Sowell, Machen’s executive assistant, 
took the 900-signature petition and informa-tion about roughly 200 call-ins to the presi-dent’s office.
“It’s a labor rights issue, and more impor -
tantly , it’s a student safety issue that we want the university to address,” Munro said.
He said drivers’ pensions are being cut, 
and wages are stagnant. They’re forced to work overtime, which can present a safety is-sue, he said.
Sowell promised to contact the group.Contracts are negotiated every three years 
and negotiations start March 1, said Chip Skinner, RTS marketing and communications supervisor.
Skinner said it is illegal for employees to 
drive more than 12 hours in a 24-hour period. They also must have at least eight hours of 
rest.
UF pays about 51 percent of RTS’s total op-
erating budget, said Students for a Democratic 
Society member Skye Schmelzer. That is about $11 million, according to the RTS Revenue Budget for the 2012 fiscal year.Organization campaigns to better bus drivers’ contracts

A Miami couple donated $5 million to a UF 
gene therapy program.
Earl and Christy Powell’s donation will 
create the Earl and Christy Powell Univer -
sity Chair in Gene Therapy and Genetics Re-
search at the UF Health Science Center, UF 
announced Tuesday.
The center was named for them in 2000 af-
ter they donated $2 million.
The therapy center helps patients of genet-
ic disorders by developing newer and safer ways to fight genetic diseases, according to its website.
The lead position of the center will be filled 
by an “internationally recognized leader in 
gene therapy” who will work on developing 
safe ways to treat patients, the release stated.
“Earl and Christy Powell’s past gener -
osity has had a significant impact on gene therapy and its translation to patient care,” UF President Bernie Machen said in a release. “Through strong endowments, such as those created by the Powells, the university and the 
Health Science Center are able to recruit and retain the best minds in medicine — scientists and physicians 
who shape the future of 
health care.”
One of its newest pro-
grams is using a harmless virus, known as adeno-as-sociated virus, which will 
help scientists study genetic diseases such as Leber’s Congential Amaurosis, a rare inher -
ited eye disease.
Earl Powell is a co-founder and partner in 
Trivest Partners, an equity firm in Miami. Ac-cording to a secretary at the firm, Powell at-tended UF and graduated from the University of Miami.Miami couple donates $5 million to

Scam versions of Angry 
Birds have been flooding the 
Android application market, 
prompting UF to warn stu-
dents about the potential dan-
ger.
UF’s Office of Information 
Security and Compliance is-sued a warning Feb. 14 to let 
students know that fake apps could steal banking, shopping and contact information from the user’s phone.
The fake apps have the 
same name as Angry Birds and are released under the name “Rovio Mobile Ltd.”
Zeljka Zorz, managing edi-
tor of Help Net Security, an information security website, said a constant stream of pop-up advertisements give away scam apps.
In an article Zorz wrote for 
Help Net Security, she stated 
the scam company used a cap-
ital “I” instead of a lowercase 
“l” in the word “Mobile” to 
register in the Android market 
with what appears to be the 
same name as the Angry Birds 
creators.
“Fake applications usually 
have one primary goal: make money for attackers,” she said.
Fake applications are espe-
cially prevalent in China and Russia, she said.
She thinks the fake appli-
cations entered the Android Market in late 2010.
People are using their 
smartphones instead of lap-tops for banking and shop-ping, said Derrius Marlin, an information security engineer 
at the UF Office of Informa-
tion Security and Compliance. 
He said spyware can find out 
where you go, who you talk 
to the most and your bank ac-count information.
Apple apps are reviewed 
and tested to ensure they are 
safe, but Android apps aren’t 
reviewed and take less time to get on the market, he said.
“People should install apps 
they need and use,” Marlin 
said. “People should reduce 
their footprint and decrease vulnerability.”
Keeping apps updated will 
help them 
resist new 
viruses, he said.
“If you 
never up-date your c o m p u t e r, you are 
open to vi-
ruses, and it is the same thing 
on your phone,” Marlin said. “If you do update your phone, you decrease your vulnerabil-
ity.”
When computers started to 
hold more personal informa-
tion, programmers made soft-
ware to steal email addresses, 
passwords and personal docu-ments from the devices, he said. The same thing is hap-pening with smartphones 
now.
“Any time you have a tar -
get-rich environment, you are 
going to have malicious activ-
ity,” Marlin said.UF warns students

A 13-year-old’s short documentary about a 
homeless family will kick off the third annual Cin-
ema Verde Film Festival today.
The eight-day festival aims to promote aware-
ness of social and environmental issues through films and events. 
Events will include screenings, fairs and a thrift-
store fashion show. The festival begins Feb. 24 and lasts through March 2.
Trish Riley, festival co-founder and director, 
said the festival’s goal is to bring another element to Gainesville’s environmental community.
Friday’s reception costs $25 for the public and is 
located at Villa East, 301 N Main St. It will showcase artwork and play student films. Those who attend will be able to judge the films, one of which was written and directed by Tara-Nicole Azarian, 13, of Charlotte, N.C.
Azarian’s film, “Cardboard,” is about a family 
who finds itself homeless with no shelter from the winter weather except scraps of cardboard.
She said she wanted to focus her film on human 
experiences, particularly those of children, because she feels they are often overlooked.
“Some people think ‘save the trees’ or ‘save the 
whales,’ but they don’t really think, ‘Save the peo-ple,’” she said. “We end up with millions of kids that are homeless, and I think that needs to change.”Cinema Verde Film Festival aims to raise

64% NOThursday’s question: Are you surprised  
by the SG election results?What a week.
While we have probably made a few enemies this week, 
we hope that we’ve provided some well-rounded coverage of 
the Student Government elections.
Things are not quite over yet, so be sure to stay tuned as 
more develops.
That bring us to our man-isn’t-it-crazy-that-those-opinion-
pages-of-the-Alligator-are-just-so-full-of-opinions edition of...
Darts & Laurels
To start, we throw an I’m-not-as-think-as-you-drunk-I-am 
DART at Georgia Thomas, a Newberry woman who decided 
that drinking a few rum and cokes at a bar and then driving home intoxicated was more important than picking up her children from church.
Classy.In good news, we give a change-for-the-better LAUREL  
to the Maryland legislature for voting to legalize same-sex 
marriage.
We hope the governor keeps his pledge to sign this bill 
into law.
Now, to the good stuff.For throwing away 268 of our newspapers on Monday, we 
throw a you-need-to-apologize-and-step-down-from-office DART at Senate President Pro Tempore Jason Tiemeier.
Contrary to the beliefs of some, we did not report on these 
actions for “sensationalism.” We found our papers had been thrown away. We investigated the situation and found evi-dence. We told the truth.
Were we supposed to ignore the act and go about our busi-
ness?
That’s ridiculous.Next, we would like to give a standing-up-for-what’s-right 
LAUREL  to the the brave sorority women who came forward 
this week to expose some of the pressures they face every SG election season. Let us hope that more will come forward and shed light on these disturbing practices.
For his accusatory video about the Alligator this week, we 
throw an at-least-we-had-sources-for-our-accusations DART 
at Tj Villamil, whom we would also like to congratulate on 
winning Student Body president.
The premise of the video was hard to follow, but it seemed 
to imply that the Alligator had ulterior motives in its cover -
age of this week’s events, namely that we are greedy, racist liars. Members (likely rogue) of the Unite Party threw away our paper, and we are the bad guys?
These accusations are just silly.We hope that Villamil will choose to rise to a higher level 
of discourse during his term as Student Body president.
Finally, we give a way-to-be-involved LAUREL  to the Stu-
dent Body for record turnout in the elections this week. Keep it up!
Have a fun and safe weekend, and be sure to check back 
next week!A modest proposal: Turn heat up on smokers
Two summers ago, UF declared its campus complete-ly tobacco-free, meaning no cigarettes (including electronic ones), no cigars and no chewing tobacco.
I was a freshman then, and I was ecstatic to hear the 
news. I was sick and tired of the constant wall of smoke permeating the Turlington area. I wished the university had provided gas masks to everyone walking through that area.
I hated when smokers would walk around and blow 
smoke directly in my face. My eyes would water and my nose would burn. From my building at Springs, I would use Turlington’s billowing smoke as a landmark for navi-gation. The smoke even blocked out Century Tower.
There were already many pollutants in the air from car 
and bus exhaust, people’s farts, harsh cleaning supplies, cooking fumes, outside barbecues and gases emitted by chemistry department research, and I didn’t know if my poor lungs could handle one more pollutant. I was so wor -
ried about my health that I considered transferring to a university that implemented a tobacco ban.
When the ban was originally put in place, UF spokes-
man Steve Orlando said, “We’re not trying to punish peo-ple. We’re trying to help people live healthier lives.”
When I saw Orlando’s statement, it hit me: UF is the 
knight in shining armor who would swoop in and rescue the idiots who started smoking.
UF is trying to make everyone healthier because it’s 
the administration’s responsibility. After all, they have de-grees, and we’re only students. They should tell us what to do and what not to do for our own health and safety.
“Nobody wants to be looked at as an outcast,” Orlando 
said. “It will be a cultural shift over time.” Orlando is com-pletely right, but my only wish is that UF would speed up the healthy culture shift. Mandatory weekly gym hours, replacing all access to soda on campus with mineral water and low-fat milk would be a great start to accelerate the culture shift we so desperately need.In addition, the director for 
community outreach said UF was not turning a cold shoulder on smokers. GatorWell and UF’s Health Education Center provide smoking cessation classes.
My wish is for UF to really 
tackle this issue and force people to stop smoking. The admission application should include a 
smoker check-box, and when a student who checks that box is admitted, he or she should automatically be enrolled in these cessation classes.
Of course, if the student doesn’t show up for the classes, 
UF should fine him or her for non-attendance. That way, the student will have less money to spend on death sticks. UF should also hire spies to find the smokers who lied on their applications and then deal with them justly.
The tobacco ban ought to be more strictly enforced. Uni-
versity Police should issue fines to those caught smoking on campus, and if that doesn’t work, a SWAT team should be dispatched to tackle those who dare to whip out a light-er.
I am so glad the tobacco ban is in place because my fam-
ily will be coming up from south Florida to visit later in the semester. Both my father and grandfather are smokers.
My father has been smoking for more than 30 years, and 
my grandfather started smoking more than 70 years ago as a child in Italy. When they come into town, UF should use its full force to coerce them into quitting their lifelong, vol-untary habit. They cannot smoke on public property that their taxes support.
I only hope the administration takes my modest pro-
posals to heart in order to extinguish this cancerous health concern.

Letter to the Editor
All engineering votes should count
My name is Michael Andrews and I am 
president of the Benton Engineering Council, 
the umbrella organization that serves as the 
official point of contact for all engineering in-
volvement. This statement was also created with the help of Amanda Scotto, BEC vice president of communications, and countless 
other leaders within BEC.
The Benton Engineering Council would 
like to officially note that no student organi-
zation or individual violated any BEC consti-tutional guidelines or bylaws. Furthermore, 
BEC officially condemns any resolution of the 
submitted party violation that would result in not counting engineering votes, regardless of political party choice.
To summarize the events that took place 
before the violation: The issue began on Feb. 16 when a Students Party candidate submit-ted an email to the Institute of Industrial Engi-neers for distribution.
According to BEC guidelines, any orga-
nization of BEC waives its right to endorse a political party.
The email sent out, however, contained 
only facts and information and featured no IIE endorsement.
The IIE student leaders have access to the 
Industrial and Systems Engineering listserv , which is the channel on which the email was sent.
Some students were not pleased with the 
political information, which is when this issue came to my attention.
I contacted both parties (both candidates 
and leaders) and sent them the contact infor -
mation of the presidents and treasurers of all BEC societies.
I had both groups of candidates submit a 
platform blurb to me for approval.I waited until both blurbs were submitted 
before approving and authorizing the distri-bution.
The Students Party team decided to contact 
all societies, whereas the Unite Party team did not decide to follow through with the blurb.
We are not exactly sure why IIE was con-
tacted in the first place or exactly how many organizations actually distributed the Stu-
dents Party message to their listservs.
The approval and distribution of these 
blurbs occurred over the weekend, at the same 
time that the Unite Party submitted a party 
violation against the ISE email.
I was not notified about this violation at all 
and did not learn about it until Tuesday night.
BEC understands that much of the ruling 
lies with Student Government, but we wanted to weigh in on the issue to defend our fellow 
engineers.This campaign, the College of Engineer -
ing slated the best candidates that it has ever seen for both parties, and I have noticed an in-creased interest in SG affairs over the last few 
weeks.
Engineering has always been isolated from 
Student Government in the past, and I am ex-
cited that we are contributing to the political discussion; however, I want to ensure that our 
classmates aren’t more disengaged from SG 
than before.
If you have any further questions regard-
ing this matter, please feel free to contact us at 
any time. Also, please stop by our Engineers 
Week 2012 events that have been occurring ev-ery day since Feb. 15 and will end on Feb. 27.

This is a response to the article, “Sorority member 
speaks out about election.”
Let me just express that I, a member of a Greek 
organization, a fellow Panhellenic woman and a UF stu-dent, endorse Beatrice Diehl in her actions 100 percent. To my dismay, when I expressed this sentiment to members of my Greek organization, I was met with disgust and was 
disregarded.
First, I would like to point out that in her opinions on 
the issue, Diehl used no slang and did not defame any 
members of her organization. For this, I respect her and her right to express her opinion (though it may be con-
trary to her organization’s interests).
Second, Diehl has been a paying member of her soror -
ity during her entire four years of college. She has been 
financially dedicated to this organization and its upkeep, 
so it would be an interesting assertion that she has been “unsisterly” after expressing her 
own opinion, on her own time and of her own accord.
Was the act “unsisterly,” or was 
it an act that asserted her status as a human being — one who has every right to express her opinion? At what point do we stop and ask ourselves: To what extent does an or -
ganization have to enforce its beliefs on its members?
Let me respond by saying that the extent to which any 
organization exerts itself over an individual, particularly in cases where that expression is not offensive to any spe-cific facet of another (as pertaining to race, creed or color) 
should be nonexistent in nongovernmental entities.
Yes, the bureaucracy is a necessity for its capacity to 
deal with many people and organize different issues nec-
essary for modern-day living, but what position or right 
does an organization that caters to the social needs (at best) and the core values (at its most detrimental) of its 
members have?
Absolutely none.
Thus, the crime here is not one of being “unsisterly.” 
The offense committed far surpasses any kind of value 
that has been morphed by the members of Panhellenic or -
ganizations to serve their own special interests.
The greatest offense committed won’t be by any one 
organization. It will be by its members, who accept this demonstration of absurdity and turn their heads away in a refusal to acknowledge, with the compensation of ac-ceptance from their “sisters,” the most gross and public 
infraction of justice that any respectable group of organi-
zations could be witness to — a restriction of the right to express oneself.

Speaking Outniency. It is okay to be working for free,” Barnett said.
The Samuel P . Harn Museum of Art relies on endowed 
funding and does not have the financial backing to pay all 
its interns.
“There are all sorts of ways in which internships can be 
beneficial, even if they are not paid,” said Eric Segal, educa-tion curator of academic programs at the museum.
As a nonprofit organization, the Harn Museum can only 
pay about six or seven of its 90 summer interns based on mer -
it and skill. However, the duties of paid and unpaid interns are seemingly identical, Segal said.
However, he said, there are nonmonetary benefits that 
come with internships, such as networking opportunities and real-world experience.
In a report by The New York Times, one of Wang’s law-
yers, Adam Klein, said unpaid interns are becoming the equivalent of entry-level employees.
Barnett said, “The problem occurs when students see it as 
a way to get their foot in the door, and employers see it as free labor.”JAVIER EDWARDS

About 236 people attended 
Shaykh Omar Suleiman’s speech 
about American media bias toward Islam on Thursday night as part of Islam Awareness Month.
“Islam Explained: The Last 
Prophet” was held in the Reitz Union Ballroom.
Islam On Campus president 
Abidah Ali said the group wanted to explain the root of the religion with this event.
“We want people to understand 
why Muslims act the way they 
act,” she said. “We follow the ex-
ample of the prophet; therefore, understanding the prophet is im-portant.”
Suleiman, who teaches at the 
Al-Maghrib Institute and Islamic Learning Foundation in Atlanta, spoke against the bias in American media against Muslims and dis-
pelled common rumors and mis-
conceptions about the faith.
He emphasized on the impor -
tance of human interaction among people of differing faiths.
“If we don’t protect the unify-
ing aspects of our faith, the next generation will reject faith alto-gether,” he said. “Ask Muslims how they feel about Islam. Give us 
a chance.”
Students had the opportunity 
to ask Suleiman questions after his 
speech.
“I learned a lot tonight,” said 
health science junior Vinnie Pieri-no, 21. “It helped put a lot of ideas I had about Islam in context.”
Twenty-one protesters from 
Dove World Outreach Center wearing “Terry Jones for Presi-dent” T-shirts stood outside the UF Bookstore before the event, each holding a sign denouncing the Is-lamic faith.
“We are here to give the true 
picture of Islam,” pastor Terry Jones said. “They’re going to keep 
telling the same peace stories that 
do not exist.”
Suleiman indirectly addressed 
the protesters during his talk. 
Referencing people who profess 
to follow Jesus but hold signs with hateful words toward the Muslim faith, he asked, would Jesus behave that way or say those same words?
Zulkar Khan, a 19-year-old mi-
crobiology sophomore, said Islam On Campus would move forward from the action of the protesters.
“Islam as a whole will move 
on,” he said. “Islam goes beyond the bounds of religion.”8, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 2012

One man also charged with attempting to punch an officer
with disorderly conduct. Aranda screamed at Salam and 
Singh and was also charged with battery on an officer and resisting with violence.
“One of them was super, super intoxicated,” said 
Salam, an accounting graduate student. “He was trying to start something. We had never seen him in our lives. We weren’t sure what was going on.”
The three other men with Aranda initially tried to hold 
him back, Salam said. Eventually, though, something switched. He doesn’t know why, but all four started fight-
ing Salam and Singh.
Two University Police officers were 
around the corner when they heard that 
a fight broke out in the parking lot. 
When they arrived, police saw four 
men kicking Salam and Singh as the vic-tims lay on the asphalt, Maj. Brad Barber said.
When officer Britney Combs attempt-
ed to drag Aranda down by his arm, he pulled away and tried to punch her, according to an arrest report. Combs 
then sprayed Aranda with pepper spray and handcuffed 
him.
Salam and Singh both said the incident was not a big 
deal. Neither went to the hospital and both were unable 
to remember how long the fight lasted.
“The cops were on it pretty much immediately,” Salam 
said.
He and Singh couldn’t have stopped it. They couldn’t 
reason with their attackers.
“It was one of those drunk things,” he said.FIGHT , from page 1� THE FAIR BEGINS AT 5 P.M.

About 100 artists will showcase 
their work this weekend at the fifth 
annual Winter Fine Arts Fair at the Tioga Town Center.
The fair is from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. Fri-
day , 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday.
Roz Miller, fair spokeswoman, said artists were selected by a jury.
Their works include photography , 
ceramics, glass, jewelry and oil and acrylic paintings.
Miller is on the board of the 
Gainesville Fine Arts Association and was on the original planning commit-tee for the fair. Her mixed-media art is 
displayed for public viewing.
“I try to create things that are what 
I call a visual symphony ,” she said. 
“Things that are dramatic, interesting, eye-catching and have texture.”
Mandy Macias, committee mem-ber and painter, said about 90 percent of the artists are local, but some come from as far away as Texas, Michigan 
and Georgia.
Miller said it’s good to have so 
much art in a small geographical area 
because people don’t have to go from city to city to enjoy it.
Several artists have returning cus-
tomers, Miller said.
“People have an ‘a-ha’ moment 
where they walk by and see a piece 
and realize they have to have it,” she 
said.Tioga Town Center art fair opens todayMEREDITH RUTLAND

A Newberry woman was arrested midnight Thursday 
on charges of child neglect for being too drunk to pick up 
her children from church.
Georgia Sue Thomas, 29, was supposed to pick up her 
three children from child care at Pentecostals of Gainesville 
on Wednesday night, but she didn’t show up, according to 
an Alachua County Sheriff’s Office report.
The report gave this account:Church staff called and texted her. She texted back that 
she was drunk downtown and wouldn’t pick up her kids.An Alachua County Sheriff’s Office deputy called 
Thomas, who told the deputy she had been drinking and was going home. 
The officer found Thomas at her 
home. She was clearly drunk. She said she’d had three rum and cokes at a bar before she drove home.
The officer gave her a breathalyzer 
test to see how much she’d been drink-ing. She blew a 0.109.
The officer arrested Thomas and 
took her to Alachua County Jail. She was charged with child neglect — a third-degree felony.Woman charged with neglecting children

  Florida senior guard Jordan Jones scored 18 points on 6-of-12 shoot-
ing from three in Thursday’s 79-45 win against Mississippi State. 
  JOE MORGAN
 Alligator Staff Writer
   
 Jordan Jones has ﬁ  nally returned to form.
  After shooting just 25.7 percent from beyond the arc 
in her last seven games, Jones made 6 of 12 from three 
in the Gators’ ﬁ  nal home game of the regular season.
  Jones’ 50-percent clip is her best mark with three or 
more attempts since a 57.1-percent outing in a 58-53 
road win against Ole Miss on Jan. 5.
  “If I had to pick a time (to break out of my shooting 
slump), it would be now,” Jones said.
  The redshirt senior guard used her long-range suc-
cess to score a game-high 18 points, boosting Florida (18-10, 8-7 Southeastern Conference) past Mississippi 
State (14-14, 4-11 SEC) 79-45 Thursday night in the 
O’Connell Center.
  Jones’ scoring effort paced the UF offense, which 
had three players score in double digits.
  Azania Stewart tallied 13 points while Jennifer 
George scored 12, helping the Gators outscore the Bull-dogs 34-20 in the paint.
  Florida also held a 51-29 rebounding advantage 
thanks to a game-high 11 boards from Stewart, nine from Ndidi Madu and eight from George.
  Stewart’s 13-point, 11-rebound effort marked her 
second double-double of the season.
  “(I was) just trying to help George [Thursday],” 
Stewart said. “George is doing such a great job drawing such good defense, so I really just tried to help her.”
  The Gators committed 17 turnovers compared to 21 
by the Bulldogs, but what each squad did with each other’s giveaways proved to be the difference.
  Florida scored 28 points off turnovers compared to 
just eight by Mississippi State.
  “We needed to lock them up and keep them from 
getting out of the gates early,” coach Amanda Butler said. “I don’t think we came out and scored right away,  Jones, Gators dominate Bulldogs at home
 In the coming weeks, there might be game when you forget he is gone.
  It’ll happen on one of those nights 
when Florida — the Southeastern Con-ference’s leader in six offensive catego-ries — is pushing 84 points. The Gators will live up to their run-and-gun billing 
to shoot over 40 percent from three like 
they have done in half of their 28 games this season.  
  You probably won’t even look down 
at the boxscore to see which team had 
more rebounds or steals. Why bother? 
Florida wins by an average of 20 points when it shoots that well.
  Those are the moments and results 
UF fans can cling to. 
Because in the nine wins and ﬁ  ve 
losses the Gators have shot below 40 percent on 3-pointers, they have needed 
Will Yeguete. 
  In those 14 
games, eight times Yeguete has come off the 
bench and either 
led Florida in re-bounding or had 
the second-most 
boards.
  But he won’t be running out onto 
the court anytime soon. Yeguete, who 
hauls in a team-high  6.3 rebounds per 
game, had season-ending surgery on 
his broken left foot this morning, which will require at least six weeks to heal.
  The injury is as tragic for Yeguete’s 
season as it is untimely for the Gators’.
  When the NCAA Tournament rolls 
around — now just three weeks away — UF will be playing the kind of op-ponents that historically hassle shoot-
ers. Instead of simply out-shooting its 
competition, Florida will have to win a low-scoring game through rebounding and sound defense.  
  In 11 games this year against tour-
nament-caliber, RPI top-100 teams, the Gators have shot well below their sea- UF’s post-
season hopes

losing Yeguete

 Preston Tucker’s room is littered with 
souvenirs from games he has played over 
the years. Some of them are more memo-rable than others. 
  “Oh geez, I have a ton of baseballs,” 
Florida’s senior right ﬁ  elder said. “I prob-ably don’t remember what they’re for. It’s just a bunch of baseballs sitting around in my room.”
  When No. 1 Florida (4-1) takes on Wil-
liam & Mary (2-2) tonight 
at 7 at McKethan Stadi-um, Tucker will have an 
opportunity to add a ball 
that he just might remem-ber to his collection. 
  He is tied with former 
Gator Brad Wilkerson for the school RBI record of 214. Five games into the 
season, Tucker is batting .450 (9 for 20) with a team-high three home runs and six RBI, which is tied with Daniel Pigott for the team lead.
  UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan can empa-
thize with opposing teams that are trying to limit Tucker. Before he could free his own pitchers from the daily struggle of facing 
one of the nation’s most powerful lineups 
in intrasquad scrimmages, Tucker was their problem. 
  “We couldn’t get him out,” O’Sullivan 
said. “For three weeks, we couldn’t get him out. Pitchers were falling behind, and next thing you know he gets on a tear. … You  Tucker on verge of breaking school RBI record

For coach Rhonda Faehn’s team, 
the pivotal stretch of 2012 begins to-
night. 
Florida (8-1, 4-1 Southeastern 
Conference) will put its new No. 1 ranking to the test when it hosts No. 3 Georgia (5-2, 4-1 SEC) in the 
O’Connell Center at 7 p.m. to finish 
its SEC slate. 
After facing the Bulldogs, UF will 
close out its regular season at No. 9 Nebraska and then at home against 
No. 5 Utah.
“Our athletes are very excited for 
this, but it’s all about getting better 
and hitting cleaner routines,” Faehn said. “In our conference, everybody 
is so strong, so you really have to be 
on your ‘A’ game.” 
Florida is 1-1 against top-10 oppo-
nents after defeating then-No. 1 Ar -
kansas on Jan. 27 and falling to then-
No. 6 Alabama a week later.
After cruising past Auburn 
197.500-196.875 last Friday, UF jumped a spot in this week’s GymIn-
fo rankings to become the top-ranked team for the first time this season. 
The Gators are familiar with being 
No. 1, but the honor didn’t convert to 
any postseason success last year, and 
hasn’t translated to national champi-onships historically.  
Florida held the top spot in the 
rankings in 11 of the 12 weeks of the 2011 regular season. Though, UF eventually failed to live up to its pre-vious production, placing second at the SEC Championships and missing 
the cut to make the NCAA Super Six 
by .75 points.
Since 2006, the Gators have been 
ranked No. 1 a total of 29 times. But they haven’t won a national title since 
claiming the Association for Intercol-
legiate Athletics for Women Champi-onship in 1982. 
“That’s kind of the mistake we 
made last year; we were stuck at the top and had nowhere to go,” ju-nior Marissa King said. “But being ranked (No. 1) now, we’re going to be using that as motivation, knowing 
that we’re here and we need to stay 
here.”
While UF’s top ranking is based 
on its 196.929 season average, Geor -
gia isn’t too far off. 
The Bulldogs average a team to-
tal of 196.725, which ties for third in the country with defending national champion Alabama. Georgia is com-
ing off a dominant 197.225-193.125 
victory against Kentucky last Satur -
day afternoon.
Also, UGA’s top all-around com-
petitor, Kat Ding, is tied for the No. 1 all-around average in the nation (39.55).
While Faehn’s prime concern is her 
gymnasts’ long-term health, she said 
she would likely showcase her stron-
gest lineup against the Bulldogs. 
“Looking at the big picture, this is 
one step in the process of what our 
goal is, which is to win SECs and put 
ourselves in the position to possibly win a national title,” Faehn said. 
“When they come running out 
of the Gator head [tonight], it’s just 
game on.” FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 15

Florida’s defense has improved each game 
this season thanks to a simple action: talking.
Improvements in communication within the 
defense have been key in No. 4 Florida’s two 
straight wins as it prepares to host Siena tonight 
at Donald R. Dizney Stadium.
In UF’s regular-season opener, an 11-9 loss 
at North Carolina, the Gators’ defense struggled 
in one-on-one situations and had trouble getting the ball to the attackers.
“I don’t think we did well on the high 1 v. 
1 drives,” coach Amanda O’Leary said. “Kara Cannizzaro scored almost four times on that 
same exact drive and we didn’t adjust to it.”
Florida followed the North Carolina loss 
with a 14-5 home win against Jacksonville and 
an 18-6 win at Maryland-Baltimore County, the first game of the season in which UF did not al-low consecutive goals. O’Leary said improved play of the defense, specifically the help defense, is a big reason for the wins.
She said UF has seen success in the same one-
on-one situations because the defenders have 
done a good job telling each other when to shift 
over if a teammate gets beaten by an attacker.
“When you are not communicating you just 
kind of feel alone out there,” junior defender Sam Farrell said. “You don’t hear your help. You don’t know if you do get beat, if someone is go-
ing to be there slide over to your girl.”
Junior Jamie Reeg said that it is vital for the 
Florida defenders to be talking to each other not 
only when there is heavy traffic, but at all times. 
“A lot of times teams just pass around and 
are just standing there not making any moves,” Reeg said. “But just keeping the talk up when things are not crazy is important so when they do start moving around we are not caught off 
guard and ready to move.”
The Gators’ defenders have experience play-
ing together as Farrell and 
Reeg have started for the last three years with juniors Kayla Stolins and Emily Dohony . But, O’Leary said, the defense is finding new levels of cohe-
siveness with every game.
“As they play together 
more and more that commu-nication becomes better and 
more direct,” she said. 
While the four juniors were well established, 
O’Leary has also thrown freshman Sally Jentis into the mix. O’Leary said that Jentis and the ju-niors have improved their communication, but there are still times the correct play is not made. 
“We haven’t quite gotten to where we need 
to be at this point,” O’Leary said. “But we are certainly on our way.”UF defenders jelling in pair of winstrAck And Field

Last year, the men’s track and field 
team won its first Southeastern Confer -
ence Indoor Championship since 2004. 
The women and men combined to win 10 SEC individual event titles  and set 
four school records. 
But for coach Mike Holloway,  past 
success doesn’t matter anymore.
“That was last year. We don’t really 
talk about last year, and we don’t re-
ally talk about defending things,” Hol-loway said. “We talk about being the champion this year and what’s going on right now.”
As the Gators travel to Lexington, 
Ky., for this year’s SEC Indoor Cham-pionship, they will be returning with seven SEC individual champions, including Gray Horn (heptathlon), Jeff Demps (60m), Eddie Lovett (60m hurdles), Tony McQuay (200m), Cory McGee (mile), Fidela James  (weight throw) and Kemal Mesic (shot put). 
“I know that those athletes have 
been there before and done it again,” Holloway said. “They understand the process of what it takes to be an SEC champion and that’s not an easy task.”
But instead of thinking about last 
year’s performance, Florida focused on getting ready for this weekend. Ac-cording to Holloway, he’s excited about the improvement he has seen from the women’s program  and is looking for -
ward to watching them compete.
Two weeks ago in New Mexico, the 
women’s team automatically qualified for the NCAA Indoor Championship 
in the 4x400-meter relay. 
Ebony Eutsey, Bria Goodson, La-
nie Whittaker and Alishea Usery ran 
a 3:33.22, allowing them to win first place and become the only team to au-tomatically qualify.
“We strive and 
have a lot of pride in being prepared 
for what we call the 
championship sea-son and that begins this weekend with the SEC Champi-
onship,” Holloway said. “When I took 
over this program, it was important for me that the men and women both 
stayed at a high level.”
Holloway has high expectations for 
the team at the championship. He be-
lieves that the Gators have a chance to score in every event they’re entered in this weekend.
“There isn’t one group that’s going 
to carry the team,” Holloway said. “It’s a broad-based team, and we’re really 
excited about seeing everyone help us 
win a championship.”Gators primed for SECs

While a concussion kept 
Yeguete out of one RPI top-100 matchup, he led the Gators in rebounding four times during the remaining 
10 games.
Florida has emerged from 
those big games with just 
three losses in large part be-cause of what Yeguete brings 
on the defensive side of the 
ball and at the front of UF’s press. 
His 6-foot-7 frame pro-
vided the perfect trap to slow down opposing guards, leading to 31 steals this sea-son — the second-most of any Florida player.   
Though Yeguete is pri-
marily Florida’s sixth man and an underwhelming of-fensive player at 4.4 points 
per game, he’s a far cry from 
being the foreign guy who played the fewest minutes of any scholarship player last season. 
His importance to the 
team can’t be overstated
With just three regular-
season games and the SEC Tournament left before The 
Big Dance, the Gators will 
have to find a way to guard elite big men like Kentucky’s Anthony Davis and Vander -
bilt’s Festus Ezeli without Yeguete in the rotation.
While those players have 
the opportunity to punish Florida on the court, miss-
ing Yeguete should also hurt 
the Gators in the eyes of the NCAA Tournament commit-tee.
UF is a lock for the tour -
nament but will be a differ -
ent team without Yeguete’s toughness off the bench down the stretch. 
This doesn’t necessarily 
mean the Gators’ season is lost, but Florida fans need to  be prepared to re-adjust ex-
pectations of what this team 
can do going forward.

Tucker is one of three Gators to re-
cord a hit in every game this season. He has also knocked in at least one run in each of the five games. Still, he underplays the record that he will almost certainly break at some point 
this weekend instead focusing on 
the few aspects of his game in which he is not excelling. 
He credits Nolan Fontana and 
Pigott, the two batters ahead of him in the lineup, for giving him RBI op-portunities while praising Mike Zu-nino and Brian Johnson, two batters typically behind him in the lineup, 
for forcing pitchers to give him 
pitches to hit. But even with that, Tucker has been disappointed in his ability to drive in runs, highlighted by a groundout to first on Wednes-day night with two runners in scor -
ing position and the record in reach. 
“I got a little too aggressive 
with it, I rolled over,” Tucker said. 
“It was just a bad at-bat. … There’s 
been several times in the past couple games where I just can’t either put the ball in play or get a hit to drive runners in.” 
With runners in scoring position this season, Tucker is 2 for 7 with three RBI and a sacrifice fly , but it is nitpicking to overlook all he has done recently because of a few at-bats. He has consistently held down the three-hole for the Gators and is carrying a swagger and sense of 
confidence that is fueling the Florida batting order. 
“He’s got presence and he’s got 
a belief that he can hit,” O’Sullivan 
said. “That’s half of the battle in this game. He hates to give away at-bats. … That’s what makes really good hitters great hitters, and he’s one of 
those guys.”16, ALLIGATOR §  FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 2012

Florida posts highest regular-season win total since 2008-09
but we came right out and disrupted.”
UF’s win against MSU was its 18th, the highest reg-
ular-season total since the 23 games won by the 2008-09 
team that advanced to the NCAA Tournament.
Jones believes this season’s squad has done enough to 
advance to The Big Dance with an at-large bid should the 
Gators fall short in next weekend’s SEC Tournament.
“Obviously, there’s still work to do and there’s still chances to get work done,” Jones said. “If I’m another team, Florida is not a team I 
would want to play. I think we’re a scary 
team with how good we can be and how we’ve shown we can be.”
The Gators went into Thursday’s 
game ranked No. 33 in RPI and No. 12 in 
strength of schedule.
Florida’s next opportunity to boost its 
NCAA Tournament resume will come against No. 10 Ten-nessee in Knoxville, Tenn., on Sunday. 
The Gators have beaten the Volunteers on the road just 
once, a 95-93 overtime win on Feb. 26, 2006 — exactly six 
years prior to this season’s matchup. Butler is 1-8 against Tennessee, and UF is 3-43 all-time against UT.
“If it’s an at-large selection, there’s no question in my 
mind that we should be there,” Butler said. “There’s still 
opportunities and there’s still games to play, and that’s 
what we have got to be focused on.”
