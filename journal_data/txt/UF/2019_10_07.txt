STUDENT-LED PROTEST 
DENOUNCES TIES TO 
TRUMP CAMPAIGN
By Ana Escalante
Alligator Staff Writer
Protest organizers want more 
than Donald Trump Jr.’s speech 
at UF to be canceled. 
They also want the UF Stu-
dent Body president to resign. 
Organizers of the #CHOMP-
TRUMP protest, which is against 
Trump  Jr. and senior campaign 
adviser Kimberly Guilfoyle’s 
speaking event at the Univer-
sity Auditorium Thursday, are 
calling for apologies and the 
resignations of ACCENT Speak-
ers Bureau Chair Henry Fair, 
Student Body President Michael Murphy and Student Body Trea-
surer Santiago Gutierrez. The 
organizers are alleging conﬂ  icts 
of interest related to Murphy’s 
father’s ties to the Trump ad-
ministration and misuse of 
funds, said protest spokesper-
son Jovanna Liuzzo.  
“We want this canceled 
because racism, sexism, ho-
mophobia, xenophobia and dis-
crimination of literally any kind 
is not valued on our campus,” 
Liuzzo said. 
Dan Murphy, Michael Mur-
phy’s father, was a lobbyist for 
UF until about a year ago, said 
UF spokesperson Steve Orlando.

Pawan “PJ” Badisa and Gators 
Football both won big Saturday. 
The Gators kept their winning 
streak, and Badisa got free Chipo-tle burritos.
Badisa, a 19-year-old UF ac-
counting sophomore, was one of 
three students who won a year’s 
supply of burritos after having 
his handmade sign with his Chi-
potle order and Instagram user-
name featured on ESPN’s College 
GameDay. 
Badisa woke up at 6 a.m. and went to the Plaza of the Americas, 
where ESPN ﬁ  lmed. Soon after he 
was on TV, Badisa received an In-
stagram message from Chipotle. 
“Saw your sign on GameDay!” 
The message read. “What’s your 
order? We’ll have it ready for you 
after the game!”

About 30 motor homes were parked in the Norman Hall parking lot near Sorority Row for the UF football game against Auburn on Saturday afternoon. “For big games, like 
this week, every spot in here, with maybe one exception or two, will be full, ” T odd Yoder said.
Michelle Yoder, 55, hangs out with sons Ryan and Justin during their tailgate Saturday 
afternoon. T odd said they usually have a television outside to watch other games so they 
can sit out and watch and talk to people. When they’re not using their motor home for 
Gator football, the Yoder family brings their RV to the beach during the summer. 
T odd Yoder, 55, grills up some meat for lunch in 
front of his RV on Saturday afternoon. Yoder’s 
wife, Michelle, said they love making new friends, 
cooking and sharing food during tailgates. 
Happy Campers
T odd and Michelle Yoder have been coming to UF home games 
for about 20 years. The majority of those years were spent 
visiting in an RV . 
“When we ﬁ  rst started coming, we slept in our van, ” Michelle 
said. “After six or seven years of that, we were like ‘We’re going 
to get a motor home and tailgate. ’”
Ever since they moved to High Springs ﬁ  ve years ago, their trips 
to Gainesville have become signiﬁ  cantly easier and shorter.

dent Donald Trump’s campaign at $5,600 
before going to an Orlando fundraising 
event. In August, he was seen talking to 
Trump Jr. in Washington, according to a 
report by Politico. 
Michael Murphy didn’t answer ques-
tions related to his father’s involvement 
with the Trump campaign, nor with 
Trump Jr. He said there is “no conﬂ  ict of 
interest.”
He wrote that UF Student Government 
invited Trump Jr., who is the executive 
vice president of the Trump Organization, 
and Democratic presidential candidate 
Sen. Bernie Sanders to speak on campus 
on Sept. 20. However, he said Sanders’ 
Chief of Staff, Caryn Compton, declined. 
The Alligator requested emails conﬁ  rming 
that Trump Jr. and Sanders were contact-
ed by SG. Michael Murphy did not provide 
the emails.  
Fair initially responded to The Alliga-
tor by text message. However, he did not 
respond to questions sent by email, text 
or phone call. 
ACCENT, which is an SG organization, 
will pay the speakers a joint payment of 
$50,000, according to a contract. Each se-
mester, $19.06 comes from each student’s 
tuition to SG, which funds ACCENT. Fair 
did not answer questions as to how the 
payment will be split between Trump and 
Guilfoyle. 
Guiterrez wrote in an email that the 
$50,000 allocated for the speech doesn’t 
break state statute or SG’s 800 codes, 
which include ﬁ  nancial rules SG must 
abide by. He wrote that demands for his 
resignation are unwarranted because he 
fulﬁ  lled his duties as treasurer. “If it does not 
break any of the 
limits of the 800 
Codes, my ofﬁ  ce 
cannot arbitrari-
ly deny a request 
on the basis of 
personal senti-
ment,” he wrote.
Trump Jr. has 
been surrounded 
by controversy 
before. He pre-
viously liked 
tweets promoting 
conspiracy theo-
ries about Park-
land shooting 
survivors being 
actors and tweet-
ed that Demo-
cratic presiden-
tial candidate 
Kamala Harris is 
not “an Ameri-
can Black.” 
Liuzzo said Trump Jr.’s rhetoric is “in-
ﬂ  ammatory” and belittles minority com-
munities on campus. The protest orga-
nizers want the event to be canceled to 
preserve student safety. 
The students created the protest to hap-
pen at the same time as the speech, which 
starts at 7 p.m.  
The #CHOMPTRUMP protest organiz-
ers will be holding a press conference Oct. 
8 on Plaza of the Americas at noon.

GATORS WILL WIN THE NA-
TIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP.” 
“I always tweet the same 
tweet. I never say what sport, 
though, because we could win in 
so many things,” Magruder said.
Singer Blanco Brown kicked 
off the hoedown ﬁ  rst. Brown end-
ed his half-hour set with his hit 
song “The Git Up,” with crowd 
members following along to the 
song’s signature line dance.
Nashville band LANCO played 
next, performing songs off of their 
debut album “Hallelujah Nights.”
Prior to performing their new 
single “Rival,” lead singer Bran-
don Lancaster told the story of 
how the band got started.
“This is not some manufac-
tured thing. This is actually ﬁ  ve 
friends,” Lancaster said. “We all 
met in college. We started drink-
ing, hanging out, playing music 
and now we’re in Gainesville 
with you all, so thank you for be-
ing a part of this dream.”
Headliner Chase Rice ﬁ  nal-
ly reached the stage at 9 p.m., 
where he got the crowd roaring 
and dancing along to his song “Lions.”
Rice performed a collection of 
his songs, including “Do It Like 
This,” “Gonna Wanna Tonight,” 
“Ride” and “Cruise” by Florida 
Georgia Line, which Rice helped 
write early in his career.
Rice, a Gators fan himself, told 
stories about seeing Gator games 
with his father as a child.
“The ﬁ  rst football ﬁ  eld I ever 
stepped foot on in my entire life 
when I was probably eight years 
old was a place called Ben Hill 
Grifﬁ  n Stadium,” Rice said. “The 
last game I ever got to see with 
my dad, he passed away years 
ago, was in The Swamp.”
Rice ended the night with his 
popular song “Ready Set Roll,” 
venturing into the crowd and 
high-ﬁ  ving members of the audi-
ence.
Kirsten Olekszak, a 20-year-
old UF public health junior, said 
being familiar with the bands 
wasn’t necessary for her to have 
a good time. 
“I think it’s always interest-
ing to see a new artist,” Olekszak 
said. “And UF offers the ability to 
see new artists.”

He immediately posted a screenshot of 
Chitpotle’s message on his Instagram, and 
his friends responded. 
“Everyone started texting and joking to 
me about getting them free burritos,” he 
said. “I’m still in shock that I get free Chi-
potle for a year.”
He met with Chipotle employees by 
Century Tower who told him that the re-
ward, 52 free burritos for the next year, 
was automatically added to his Chipotle 
account.
“I’ve been eating Chipotle 
every Sunday,” he said. “So I’ll 
probably continue to do that.”
This contest promoted Chipotle’s new 
delivery service, said Sara Putnam, an ac-
count executive at Burson Cohn & Wolfe, 
Chipotle’s public relations agency.  
“By bringing delivery to college stu-
dents who got their order signs on TV, 
it was a fun and engaging way to get the 
word out that Chipotle delivers,” she said. 
The last free burrito giveaway the 
company did was through TikTok. Par-
ticipants were asked to post a Chipotle re-
lated TikTok on Twitter, and the ﬁ  ve most 
retweeted videos were awarded with free 
burritos for a year, said Putnam.
“Chipotle does its best to reward loyal 
customers as much as possible,” she said.

HE HAS A $3.5 MILLION BOND
By  Alex DeLuca
Alligator Staff Writer
A Gainesville man was arrested Friday af-
ter he was accused of beating and raping his 
pregnant girlfriend to kill his unborn son. 
Joseph Bernard Combs, 20, is facing an 
attempted murder charge and a $3.5 mil-
lion bond after police said he battered the 
woman to cause a miscarriage, according to a 
Gainesville Police arrest report.    
The woman, who is 19 weeks pregnant, 
was on the phone with a friend shortly before 
the battery happened, the report said. When 
she hung up the phone, Combs told her, “I’m 
sorry, but I can’t let you have my son.”
Combs grabbed the woman by her hair 
and dragged her into the living room, where 
he began repeatedly punching and kicking her 
in the stomach, according to the report. After 
that, he dragged her upstairs and continued 
to attack her. 
When the woman ran downstairs to es-
cape, Combs stopped her and dragged her 
back upstairs, where he continued punching 
and slapping her, the report said.  
Police said Combs noticed a cut on the vic-
tim’s head and attempted to clean it. Before continuing the battery, he 
again told the victim, “I’m 
sorry, but I have to kill the 
baby.”
He then pulled out a 
folding knife and held it to 
the victim’s throat, accord-
ing to the report. The vic-
tim, who believed Combs 
intended to kill her, told him, “I’ll do any-
thing, but don’t take my life.”
Combs told the woman, “I want you to do 
it yourself,” and ordered her to cut her wrists, 
the report said. 
When the woman went to do so, Combs 
stopped her and demanded she get on the 
ground. He told the woman to perform sex 
acts against her will, police said.  
The victim suffered bruising to her stom-
ach, forearms, shins and breast, as well as a 
swollen jaw and blood in her left eye, accord-
ing to the report. 
Combs is being held in Alachua County 
Jail on charges of attempted premeditated 
murder, sexual battery, aggravated battery, 
aggravated assault and kidnapping.

The downtown gallery closed Sept. 29 after just more than a year of business.
ALL REMAINING PIECES 
WILL BE SOLD
By Stamatina Copulos
Alligator Contributing Writer
Gainesville residents will no 
longer be able to sip rosé as they 
browse local art. 
On Sept. 29, the Somewhere 
Along The Way art gallery and 
wine cafe closed its doors because 
the owner is in the process of 
moving to Boston. The store was 
open for a year and a half.
The owner, Mark Richardson, is moving to Boston with his fami-
ly because his wife got a job there, 
said store manager Christina Bar-
tonicek. Richardson hopes to open 
another gallery in an area of the 
city with many local businesses.
Before closing, the art in the 
store was sold and all of the pieces 
remained for sale unless the artists 
came to pick them up, Bartonicek 
said. The business will ﬁ  nish mov-
ing out of its rented space perma-
nently by the end of October.
The gallery moved from Mican-
opy to its Second Avenue location 
in February 2018 after three years in hopes of attracting more traf-
ﬁ  c. But, the location’s higher costs 
made it tougher for the business to 
stay aﬂ  oat, Bartonicek said.
Most of the pieces sold in the 
gallery were from local artists. 
The demand for art in Gainesville 
is high, and local contribution and 
support was important to the gal-
lery, she said.
The gallery shared a block with 
another art shop, Black C Art Gal-
lery. Bartonicek recalls her neigh-
bors as being wonderful.
“It felt like we were building a 
little art community,” Bartonicek said. “The hardest part is los-
ing the customers, because they 
always make the experience the 
best.”
Laura Jupin, a hair stylist at 
Dale’s Salon across the street, was 
a long-time regular of the gallery 
since it opened in Micanopy.
Jupin said she came in to the 
gallery sometimes for beer, but 
more often she came for the com-
pany when she was on break. 
She bought many pieces over the 
years, including originals by Bar-
tonicek.
Jupin, who participated in Artwalk with the gallery every 
month, credited her attraction to

Column
Biden’s son is innocent, but Trump’s sons probably are not 
We’re now a few weeks into the infa-
mous Trump-Ukraine scandal, and as 
Democrats seek impeachment, Presi-
dent Donald Trump continues to deny 
his wrongdoings. In the wake of this 
controversy, it might be helpful to understand 
the origins of this scandal: Trump claimed that 
Joe Biden blackmailed the Ukrainian government 
into derailing an investigation toward Burisma 
Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company where 
Biden’s son, Hunter, worked as an executive. The 
big question everyone has been asking since is if Trump’s 
allegations are accurate. 
The short answer: No. It’s true that Hunter Biden was 
part of the board of directors of Burisma Holdings from 
2014 to 2019, partially overlapping Joe Biden’s tenure as 
vice president of the United States. Hunter Biden had joined 
Burisma’s board of directors around the same time their 
CEO — Mykola Zlochevsky, a former minister of Ukraine — 
was under investigation for money laundering by Britain’s 
Serious Fraud Ofﬁ  ce, which had frozen his London bank 
accounts. However, this is where the facts start to diverge 
from reality. 
The real issue lies with Ukrainian prosecutors who had 
refused to investigate Burisma and other allegations of cor-
ruption to the fullest extent, despite urging from Britain. 
This led the U.S. and several other countries to get in-
volved, which pressured Ukraine into ﬁ  ring their prosecu-
tor general, Viktor Shokin. Joe Biden would later brag about 
having threatened to withhold military aid to get Shokin 
ﬁ  red. Given that there is no evidence Hunter Biden was 
under threat of being investigated by Shokin, this situation 
just looks like a former vice president boasting about how 
he helped discharge a corrupt ofﬁ  cial through bribery.
In addition, the discord surrounding Joe Biden’s son 
brings up the question of Trump’s sons and how they have 
beneﬁ  ted from their father’s position. While the president 
hasn’t divested himself from his conglomerate, his sons 
Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump have been charged with 
running the day-to-day operations. Under them, the Trump 
Organization has continued making foreign deals in places 
like the Dominican Republic — despite President Trump’s pledge that his company would pursue no new 
foreign deals during his presidency. Watchdog 
organizations have also pointed out interactions 
where Trump’s presidency beneﬁ  ts his and his 
sons’ businesses. According to Citizens for Re-
sponsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), 
in order to gain favor with Trump, foreign gov-
ernments have made payments to Trump prop-
erties since he took ofﬁ  ce, members of Congress 
have patronized Trump properties, political com-
mittees and organizations have held events on 
Trump properties and White House ofﬁ  cials have promoted 
Trump businesses. All of this is more money ﬂ  owing into 
the accounts of the president and his sons, which wouldn’t 
have happened if he hadn’t been elected in the ﬁ  rst place.
Whether he realizes this or not, many of the Trump 
administration’s concerns about Hunter Biden apply to 
Trump’s kids even more. During a roundtable in Arizona 
on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence summarized the 
administration’s stance by saying, “I think the American 
people have a right to know if the vice president of the 
United States or his family proﬁ  ted from his position as 
vice president during the last administration.” Replace vice 
president with president, and the last administration with 
this administration, and I completely agree. Furthermore, 
as The Atlantic pointed out, the Trump administration con-
doning putting pressure on a foreign country to launch an 
investigation into the business of a political rival’s son sets 
a precedent that could just as easily apply to the next Dem-
ocratic president seeking to investigate the Trump children.
To clarify, I think a president ordering investigations 
solely for political purposes is wrong, whether it’s done by 
a Democrat or a Republican, and it’s even worse if other 
countries get involved. But at the same time, it needs to be 
pointed out: any alleged conﬂ  icts of interest by Joe Biden 
and his son pale in comparison to the documented conﬂ  icts 
of interest committed by Trump’s children on an almost 
daily basis.

uncertain world
It’s dangerous to care.
In the United States, we often tend to associate danger 
with the increased frequency of mass shootings or hate 
crimes that are provoked by a variety of factors. However, 
although we have experienced great hardships as a popula-
tion, many of us don’t know what it’s like to put our lives on the 
line for a cause. Unfortunately, this may change soon. 
Across the globe, journalists and activists are being injured or 
killed for standing up for what they believe in. On June 28, 2018, 
ﬁ  ve people were shot dead at the Capital Gazette Newsroom in 
Annapolis, Maryland, over a defamation lawsuit from 2012. Four 
of them were journalists, one of them was an Alligator alumnus 
and none of them were directly responsible for “defacing” the 
gunman. Now more than ever, it seems like you can’t be com-
pletely safe anywhere. 
Despite tragedies like this, compared to some other countries, 
the U.S. is regarded as a safe place for journalists.
According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, between 
1992 and 2019, only 14 journalists were killed in the U.S. On the 
other hand, 116 journalists were killed in Mexico, and this num-
ber is increasing. On Saturday, a National Geographic journalist 
was shot in Juárez, Mexico, while interviewing a drug dealer.  
While this attack was not aimed at the journalist, other journal-
ists pursuing stories about corruption and human rights are often 
targeted for their involvement. And now, even people outside the 
ﬁ  eld are being targeted. 
Activists from around the world are being killed while ﬁ  ghting 
for their causes, and it seems like the people who are supposed to 
protect them in the ﬁ  rst place are causing this.  
Protests can be dangerous places as well. Another unfortunate 
event occurred Saturday, when the death toll in an anti-govern-
ment protest in Iraq reached nearly 100 people. More than 3,000 
people had been injured as of Saturday, and the police continue 
to use live rounds in an effort to control the crowd. 
Maybe if governments started listening to their people, police 
forces wouldn’t resort to using bullets. 
Unfortunately, it seems more than one country is having hear-
ing issues. This past Tuesday, a Hong Kong police ofﬁ  cer shot a 
protestor in the chest with a live round. This came after months 
of protesting, and ironically, it came on the same day that China 
celebrated 70 years of communist rule. Leave it to the Chinese 
government to show its strength by harming someone who wants 
to leave it.
Could it be that the Chinese government has some dependen-
cy issues? Maybe. Does that mean it gets to harm the people that 
it’s supposed to protect? Of course not. We’ve all had some dif-
ﬁ  cult relationships, but most of us know when it’s time to let go. 
In the case of “who hurt who ﬁ  rst,” protesters aren’t exactly 
guilt-free. In both China and Iraq, protestors have been using 
violent tactics in order to get the attention of their government. 
In Iraq, demonstrators have set ﬁ  re to the headquarters of six 
different political parties. In China, they have vandalized many 
subway stations or stores that appear to be pro-government.
Despite this, the amount of violence used against protestors 
is concerning. In Iraq, authorities have accused an unidentiﬁ  ed 
sniper of shooting into a crowd of protestors. In China, a taxi 
driver drove into a crowd of protesters, and a man was beaten 
by a mob afterward. In both cases, it seems like citizens tried to 
enact justice based on their own ideals, but they took action in 
radical ways.
The world is a dangerous place when you have an opinion. 
If you choose to ﬁ  ght for something you believe in, make sure 
you’re prepared for the cost.

College GameDay heads to Baton Rouge Saturday
ESPN's Saturday morning college football show will be on campus at LSU 
for its game against the Gators. This will be the third time this season that 
Florida is featured on GameDay.Running back Lamical Perine 
broke an 88-yard touchdown 
run to seal the win against 
Auburn, the longest by a UF 
player since a 96-yard Emmitt 
Smith run in 1988.

Kyree Campbell was right: The 
Gators indeed played “big boy ball” 
Saturday night.
Florida’s elite defense reared its 
head, and the offense executed well 
enough for UF to secure a 24-13 win 
over Auburn at Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Sta-
dium.
In the week leading up to the 
game, several Florida players spoke 
on perceived disrespect in the polls 
and otherwise. Well, UF addressed 
that in a big way, moved up three 
spots in the AP Top 25 Poll to No. 
7 and notched a resume-building 
win for its potential College Football 
Playoff case.Now, the Gators get to do it all 
over again this week. Against a bet-
ter team. In a hostile environment.
As coach Dan Mullen has said, 
that’s life in the SEC.
“You know what winning a big-
time game like this mean?” he said. 
“You have to show up tomorrow , 
and get ready to win an even bigger 
one tomorrow.”
UF will travel west to Baton 
Rouge, Louisiana, this weekend for 
another top-10 matchup against No. 
5 LSU.
The Gators (6-0, 3-0 SEC) by 
no means played a perfect game 
against Auburn. UF turned the ball 
over four times and struggled once 
again to run the ball, save for Lami-
cal Perine’s 88-yard touchdown run. But there’s a much larger margin for 
error when the defense holds a team 
to 13 points and racks up four turn-
overs of its own.
Florida’s defense has now given 
up just one touchdown in 13 quar-
ters since quarterback Feleipe Franks 
went down. The Gators’ 17 take-
aways lead the nation and they’re in 
the top ﬁ  ve for scoring defense, op-
ponent red zone touchdown percent-
age, sacks and tackles for loss.
But LSU quarterback Joe Burrow, 
statistically the best passer UF will 
face all season, leads the No. 1 scor-
ing offense in the FBS. The Tigers (6-
0, 3-0 SEC) average 54.6 points per 
game and Florida’s defense allows 
just 9.5. Naturally, something will Florida passes its biggest test of season, so far

VOLLEYBALL

Sports Writer 
Sunday afternoon’s 
game against No. 15 
Kentucky presented 
multiple opportunities for 
Florida’s volleyball team: 
To ﬁ  nally get a statement 
win. To take a stranglehold 
on the SEC early in 
conference play. And to 
prove that it could go on 
the road against a tough opponent and come out on 
top. 
In the two sets they won, 
the Gators looked like they 
could check all of those 
boxes. But instead, they 
travel back to Gainesville 
empty-handed after getting 
steamrolled in the ﬁ  nal two 
sets, losing 25-12, 19-25, 
22-25, 25-19, 15-8.
Here are three 
takeaways:Consistently inconsistent 
defense
On Sunday, the No. 
12 Gators (11-3, 2-1 SEC) 
compiled a season-high 
16 total blocks. Middle 
blocker Lauren Dooley led 
the team with seven. 
Yet, the loss against 
Kentucky (11-4, 4-0 SEC) 
was arguably one of the 
team’s worst defensive 
performances this season. 3 takeaways from UF's loss
Like many others be-
fore Saturday, I had 
serious doubts about 
the potential of this 
Florida football team. 
Yes, it was undefeated. Yes, 
it had talent on both sides 
of the ball. But the way it 
won its games left a lot to 
be desired.
The Gators’ close Week 
0 win against Miami and a dramatic 
comeback win over an unranked Ken-
tucky with a backup quarterback didn’t 
exactly spark much conﬁ  dence for me 
and a lot of others. Going into the Au-
burn game, I expected UF’s train of luck 
to ﬁ  nally reach its last stop.
But the team showed something dif-
ferent in its 24-13 win over Auburn on 
Saturday in its biggest test of the year so 
far.
Any doubts about whether UF’s de-
fense was an elite unit before the game 
were entirely put to bed after. Four take-
aways and only 13 points relented in a 
game where ﬁ  ve Auburn drives started 
in Florida territory is nothing short of re-
markable.
The defensive front has been at or 
near the top of the national sack race 
since its 10-sack performance against 
the Hurricanes. And it sacked the mobile 
freshman quarterback Bo Nix twice on 
Saturday.
The secondary, which had some issues 
tackling early in the season, suffocated 
receivers downﬁ  eld, holding Auburn’s 
receiving corps to 145 yards and Nix to a 40.7 completion percentage.
Even the special teams have 
looked good.
Kicker Evan McPherson 
sports a 90-percent conversion 
rate on the season after Satur-
day’s 41-yard ﬁ  eld goal, and 
punter Tommy Townsend has 
downed nine of his 14 punts 
inside the 20-yard line this 
year.
Where things get tricky is on the of-
fensive side of the ball.
Redshirt junior quarterback Kyle 
Trask has been a pleasant surprise ﬁ  ll-
ing in for the injured Feleipe Franks. 
He’s shown good decision making, and 
his quick release is perfect for coach 
Dan Mullen’s dink-and-dunk scheme. He 
came back against the unranked Wild-
cats down 11 in the fourth quarter and 
beat up on a ﬂ  oundering Tennessee and 
FCS opponent Towson.
But against Auburn, he looked like a 
backup for the ﬁ  rst time, fumbling three 
of the four times he was sacked and 
missed multiple throws with pressure in 
his face.
Trask’s 234 yards and two touch-
downs masked the mistakes stemming 
from poor pocket awareness and were 
enough to get the win. But he’ll need to 
be more consistent to win games against 
No. 5 LSU in Death Valley next week and 
No. 3 Georgia in Jacksonville two weeks 
later.

SOCCER

Losing four out of six 
games to begin the season 
made it seem like Florida’s 
soccer team would go the 
entire 2019-20 campaign un-
ranked. But UF has caught fire 
as of late, and the United Soc-
cer Coaches’ Poll has started 
to take notice.
The Gators were the first 
team out in last week’s rank-
ings with 53 votes, but Sunday 
night’s 3-1 victory over No.12 
Texas A&M at Donald R. 
Dizney Stadium in Gainesville 
all but ensured their spot in 
the top 25.
“It’s a big win for us,” 
coach Becky Burleigh said. 
“Texas A&M is clearly one of 
the top teams in the league 
and has been for a while. For 
us to get this win, I think, is a 
really big confidence booster 
and just another step for us.”
UF (8-4, SEC 4-0) defender 
Kit Loferski wreaked havoc 
down both sidelines in the 
opening half. She started the 
game on the right side but 
worked her way across the 
Aggies’ (9-1-3, SEC 3-0-1) 
back line. Her constant move-ment paid off in the seventh 
minute when she made a blaz-
ing run down the left sideline 
to get by Aggies defender Bri-
ana Alston, who eventually 
tackled Loferski in the box for 
a penalty. 
Forward Madison Alex-
ander, who had yet to score 
a goal on the season, placed 
the ball on the penalty spot, 
stared down the goalkeeper 
and exhaled before burying it 
in the back of the net.
The Gators doubled their 
lead in the 18th minute thanks 
to forward Vanessa Kara’s 
knack for being in the right 
place at the right time. Kara 
pounced on a through ball 
outside of the 18-yard box 
and dinked the ball over the 
goalkeeper to give Florida a 
2-0 advantage.
Both goals masked a foul-
laden first half, which saw 
defender Julia Lester, forward 
Kouri Peace and Kara come 
away with minor injuries. 
Both Lester and Kara stayed 
on the pitch after being tended 
to for several minutes, while 
Peace was kept on the bench 
until the second half.
A pass from midfielder 
Sammie Betters to Kara in the 67th minute put Kara one-on-
one with Texas A&M goal-
keeper Shantel Hutton. Kara 
once again got the better of 
Hutton, as the forward placed 
the ball in the bottom-left cor-
ner for her eighth goal in the 
last six games.
The Aggies responded in 
the 74th minute, however, 
when forward Taylor Ziemer 
slithered her way around UF’s 
defense and snuck the ball 
past goalkeeper Susi Espinoza 
to cut the deficit to two.
Luckily for Florida, Espino-
za was unfazed after conced-
ing the goal.
The redshirt junior made 
two crucial saves in the last 
10 minutes to stall Texas 
A&M’s comeback attempt and 
give the Gators their sixth-
consecutive victory.
“We’d like to manage the 
end of games better,” Burleigh 
said. “I told our team I think 
we took a step forward but 
still have room for improve-
ment there.”

Two Gators women’s 
tennis players made their 
fall debuts this weekend 
in Fort Myers, Florida, 
representing the Gators 
at the Bedford Cup. 
Sophomore Sydney 
Berlin and senior Tsveta 
Dimitrova combined for 
a 5-3 record in singles 
and a 2-1 mark in dou-
bles against seven other 
Florida schools in the 
three-day event. 
The lefty Berlin ex-
celled in her 2019 debut, 
failing to drop a set in her 
first three matches. This 
streak earned her a spot 
in the Flight B champion-
ship match against FAU’s 
Louie McClelland on 
Sunday morning at the 
FGCU Tennis Complex.
Despite Berlin’s roar-
ing comeback attempt, 
she fell just a few points 
short of claiming the 
Cup, losing 6-4, 4-6, 11-
9.
After dropping the 
first set, the Buffalo, New 
York, native stormed 
back by taking the sec-ond set but couldn’t com-
plete it in the decisive 
third-set tiebreaker. 
She didn’t leave emp-
ty-handed, though. Ber-
lin was given a sports-
manship award from the 
Bedford Cup tournament 
directors for her exem-
plary competition on the 
court. 
Dimitrova didn’t have 
quite the same success as 
Berlin in her fall debut, 
but still held her own 
with a 2-2 singles record 
this weekend. 
“(Sydney Berlin) and 
Tsveta (Dimitrova) came 
up a bit short in their 
matches today, but I 
was really proud of their 
fight to give themselves 
a chance to battle back 
in the second,” assistant 
coach Lauren Embree 
said in a release. “We 
will continue to put in 
the work and improve for 
the rest of the fall.”

have to give in that regard.
Quarterback Kyle Trask, who briefly ex-
ited the game Saturday with a knee injury, 
did not let on that the LSU game will take on any additional weight.
“That’s going to be the biggest game just 
because it’s the next game,” he said. “No 
matter who we are playing, it’s going to be 
the biggest game for us, we are going to pre-
pare the same way.”But the coverage around the team, which 
has now won 10 straight games, says other-
wise. The spotlight that was on UF the past 
two weeks will follow the team to Louisiana 
as the College GameDay crew will be at the 
Gators’ game for a second-straight week.
Heading into the season, it was clear this 
four-game stretch from October to Novem-
ber featuring Auburn, LSU and Georgia — all 
top-10 teams — would be difficult. And Flor-ida passed its first test of the SEC gauntlet. 
Test No. 2 and more “big boy ball” awaits 
them in Louisiana.
“We’re going to turn on that film on Mon-
day and go watch LSU and know we’ve got 
to head to Death Valley and say, ‘If we want 
to be there, go do it,’” Mullen said.

sistent protection from his offen-
sive line, the unit that has been 
the biggest weak spot on an oth-
erwise deservedly top 10 squad.
The line saw the departure of 
four starters over the offseason, 
and the replacements have been 
incapable of meeting the already 
low expectations set for them at 
the start of the season.
The line has allowed 12 sacks 
thus far, and its inability to get 
a consistent push at the line is a 
big reason why Florida ranks 11th 
in the SEC in rushing yards per 
game (139.8).
This unit, and the offense as a 
whole, will need to be better — 
no other way to put it.
The Gators can go far, and 
though they have a tough sched-
ule ahead, their biggest opponent 
is still themselves.COLUMN,  from pg. 10
Chris King / Alligator Staff
The Gators' defense shut down true freshman Auburn quarterback Bo Nix, sacking him twice and forcing three interceptions — including 
one from safety Shawn Davis (31). The Tigers were held scoreless during the second half.
In the two sets that Florida 
won, it limited the Wildcats 
to hitting percentages under 
.100. Kentucky had hitting 
percentages over .330 in the 
three sets it won. Overall, UK 
hit .237 — the fourth-highest 
mark a team has hit against the 
Gators this season. 
Florida was often late getting 
to blocks, and they couldn’t 
contain Kentucky’s trio of 
outside hitters Leah Edmond 
and Alli Stumler and middle 
blocker Leah Meyer, who all 
registered double-digit kills. 
Too many errors
In last season’s matchup 
in Lexington, Kentucky, the 
Gators were easily swept by 
the Wildcats. The Gators were 
as much of an opponent to 
themselves in that one as the 
Wildcats were. UF racked up 20 
attack errors across the three 
sets. 
This year, the Gators came 
out in the first set and did the 
same thing. 
Florida totaled 10 attack 
errors in the first set alone and 
tacked on a couple of service 
errors as well. As a result, its 
hitting percentage in the set 
was a mind-boggling -.138. It might have gotten away with 
that against the likes of Liberty 
and USF, but not against quality 
opponents like Kentucky, 
especially on the road. 
Outside hitter Thayer Hall 
led the team in kills with 
17, but she also committed 
11 attack errors on a day 
where she only hit .092 on 65 
swings. The Gators need more 
production and efficiency  out 
of Hall moving forward when 
they match up against quality 
competition. 
Florida second in SEC now
There are only three SEC 
teams currently ranked in the 
top 25. Kentucky swept the 
only other ranked SEC team, 
Missouri, last weekend, and the 
Gators won’t see the Wildcats, 
again, until Nov. 17.  
Taking a match on the 
road against Florida’s biggest 
competition in the SEC would 
have effectively pegged the 
Gators as the favorite to win 
the regular-season conference 
title. 
But for now, all they’ll have 
to think about is, “What if?”
