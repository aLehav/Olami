old man driving a dump truck led them on 
an hour-long chase over roads, rails and yards in the Syracuse area that ended with the suspect being shot. 
The Onondaga County Sheriff said Stan-
ley Lostumbo jumped into a dump truck Tuesday night after being accused of steal-ing from vending machines at a mall.
Police pursued the truck on a highway, 
through backyards and school grounds and down railroad tracks at speeds up to 65 mph before stopping it at a barricade in East Syra-cuse.
Police said Lostumbo reversed the truck 
and hit a sheriff’s vehicle and officers fired, apparently striking Lostumbo in the shoul-der. He was briefly hospitalized for minor injuries.
Deputies were questioning Lostumbo. It 
was not clear if he had a lawyer.

� ANTI-VIOLENCE GROUPS ARE COMING TOGETHER 
TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THREATS AGAINST THE CHURCH DO NOT REPRESENT ALL MUSLIMS.
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Staff Writer
Amid the controversy surrounding the Dove World Out-
reach Center’s plan to burn the Quran on Sept. 11, Islamic 
groups have been advising Muslims to not let their frustra-tion turn into violence.
Ziad Ghanimi, spokesman for the Gainesville Muslim 
Initiative, said the local Muslim community condemns any form of violence against the church’s pastor, Terry Jones, or its members.
“It’s counterproductive to be violent,” he said. “We should 
try to engage in a discussion.”
Ghanimi said an attack on the church would only bolster 
Jones’ stance.
“Violence will not make him change his mind,” he said. “It 
will just confirm his position — especially if 
those that are violent are Muslims.”
The condemnation comes after The 
Gainesville Sun reported receiving a death 
threat directed toward Jones Tuesday eve-
ning.
According to the article, the Sun gave the 
letter to the Gainesville Police Department, who is investigating the matter.
In a statement released by The American Muslim Associa-
tion of North America on Wednesday, the group condemns the Quran burning but denounces violent reaction to the event.
“We would like to remind that Islam calls for vigorous 
condemnation of such hateful acts, but always within the 
margins of law and order,” the statement said.
The statement was signed by 15 imams — Islamic leaders 
— and Ahmed Al Mehdawi, president of the Islamic Center 
of Gainesville. 
Sofian Zakkout, director of the American Muslim Associa-
tion of North America, said Muslims should exhibit tolerance and control because violence only weakens America’s sense of unity.
“Our enemies would be looking at us and laughing at us,” 
he said. “We would be doing their job for them.”Local Muslims 
say violence won’t solve Dove problem

Students may have something to 
be itchy about.
Bed bug infestations are becom-
ing more and more common on col-
lege campuses, crawling between the sheets with students and biting them while they sleep.
Their numbers have exploded 
in the past five years, said Wayne Walker, senior pest control techni-cian for UF’s Department of Hous-ing and Residence Education.  
“Most of us in the industry believe it’s because of increased international travel and truly a lack of awareness by most people that it is a problem,” Walker said. “Most of the bed bug is-sues are brought in by people travel-ing in hotels and motels and ending up back in their residence or them picking up used furniture.”
A bed bug is a small, blood-suck-
ing insect whose adult form is around a quarter-inch in length, Walker said. The bug is from the same family as stinkbugs, and if a lot of them are in one room, there is a noticeable smell.
Though the bugs are not known 
to transmit any diseases, their bite 
has been known to cause an uncomfortable itch and, in some cases, an allergic reaction.  
Walker, as well as Roberto Pereira, another UF bed bug expert, said the problem has not affected UF’s dormi-tories as much as it has affected other campuses.
In the past five years, there have 
been about four bed bug occurrences in the UF dormitories, Walker said.However, graduate students have 
not been so lucky.

▪ Look for black spots on linens.
▪ Pull sheets back; look around the box spring.▪ Check around the bed.▪ Beware if the room has a smell similar to that of a stinkbug.
How To Avoid Bed Bugs:
▪ Check your bags for bed bugs while traveling.▪ Beware of bed bugs in used furniture.▪ Call your local pest-control agency if you spot bed bugs.SEE BUGS, p AGE 3News Today

Santa Fe College president Jackson Sasser speaks at the grand opening of the UF @ Santa Fe Gator Den 
center on the Santa Fe College campus Wednesday morning.
ACADEMIC

Alligator Contributing Writer
UF and Santa Fe College stu-
dents seeking an online degree 
have a new UF resource available to them.
The grand opening of the UF @ 
Santa Fe Center,  also known as the Gator Den, took place Wednesday morning. 
Located in Building H of Santa 
Fe’s Northwest campus at 3000 NW 83rd Street, the Gator Den is a partnership between UF and Santa Fe.
The goal of the facility is to pro-
vide easier access to online degree programs and help prepare trans-fer students for entrance into UF.
UF is currently offering online 
degree programs in business ad-ministration and sports manage-ment through Santa Fe, but more 
will be added as the new program 
expands. 
Steve Dorman, dean of the UF 
College of Health and Human Per -
formance, said only a small per -
centage of adults in Florida have a bachelor’s degree. 
Because of these statistics, Dor -
man said, it is important to make 
education more available to resi-
dents across the state of Florida. 
“This is two government agen-
cies getting it right for the better -
ment of Floridians,” Dorman said.
UF paid for the building’s reno-
vation, which cost about $200,000, according to Santa Fe’s website, sf-college.edu. UF and Santa Fe will 
split the cost of a full-time adviser/
recruiter, who will give informa-tion about UF’s distance-learning programs and transferring to UF.UF info center opens

UF professors developed a beg-bug 'cooker' to combat infestations
festations are reported per year in 
graduate housing, Walker said.  
Off campus, the number of cases per year is even greater, though the bed bug problem is not as bad in Florida as it is in other states, Pereira said.
Students should immediately notify on-
campus pest control if they discover bed bugs in dormitories or graduate housing.
Bed bugs, particularly young ones, are 
difficult to see with the naked eye. Baby bed 
bugs are clear and about the size of a period 
on a printed paper, Pereira said.
When bed bugs feed, they defecate, he 
said. So, the best way to look for bed bugs is to look for black spots on linens. 
Pereira, along with Walker and another pro-
fessor, Phillip Koehler, came up with a simple solution to the bed-bug problem  —  cook them.  
They put up walls around  infested items, such as blankets, with Styrofoam panels, and 
then place a heater or fan inside to create, in effect, an oven.
They then monitor the tem-
perature inside the “oven” until 
all the bed bugs are dead.
Though the design is simple and could be 
built at home, Pereira advised potential home bed bug warriors to leave it to the experts. 
Bed bugs are typically harmless aside 
from causing an uncomfortable itching sen-
sation, although Walker said bed bugs could 
be harmful in other ways.
“When you share your bed with a bed 
bug, it’s a traumatic experience of sharing your bed with something that feeds on you,” he said. “So the trauma of it all and the men-tal anguish is an issue.”BUGS , from page 1
OnCampu s� NATIONAL USED CAR PRICES HAVE GONE UP.
By SAMANTHA SHAVELL
Alligator Contributing Writer
Used-car prices are increasing nationally, but Gainesville 
consumers can still find good deals. 
Research from Edmunds.com, an online resource that 
estimates car values, shows that the prices of used cars in-
creased by about 10 percent nationally since last July.
But Ramon Young, a car salesman at Gatorland Pre-
Owned Superstore, said he’s seen no change in prices. 
“People find used cars less expensive,” he said.  “They 
do research on new vehicles so we have to keep our prices down.” 
Today, the estimated national price for a three-year-old vehicle is $19,248, an increase of $1,800 from last year’s price. And in the last 12 months, used-car and -truck prices increased 17 percent and some sport utility vehicles are up 30 percent since last July, according to the United States Bu-reau of Labor Consumer Price Index Summary. The spike in 
prices may be a result of consumers’ economic confidence. 
“A lack of confidence in the economy is driving more 
people to used cars, putting upward pricing pressure on a 
limited supply of vehicles,” said Joe Spina, a senior analyst for Edmunds.com, in a press release.
David Denslow, a UF economics professor thinks the in-
crease in prices is also partly due to the Cash for Clunkers program, which paid people to trade in their old cars for new ones and thus increased the supply of used cars. 
“Now that that’s gone, people are holding onto their old 
cars so there’s not much supply and it is holding up prices,” Denslow said. By REBECCA ASTORGA

Freshman Xavier Hanson didn’t 
break a sweat during his bike ride out-side the Reitz Union on Wednesday morning. 
He said he felt like he was doing 
half the work. 
The battery helping to propel the bi-
cycle did the rest.
This Sanyo Eneloop bicycle was the 
newest display at the third annual Al-ternative Transportation Fair hosted by the UF Office of Sustainability . 
Organizations such as Gators for a 
Sustainable Campus, Sustainable UF 
and the American Solar Energy Soci-
ety set up tables at the fair to hand out brochures and help promote energy-efficient transportation alternatives.
The fair was held to help promote 
the One Less Car Challenge, which en-courages students and faculty to use al-ternative transportation through Nov. 19. 
Ashley Pennington, outreach coor -
dinator for the Office of Sustainability , said she hoped the fair helped students and faculty become more aware of the many benefits of alternative transpor -tation, such as riding the bus, biking or 
walking to school. 
“By not taking a car to places, peo-
ple don’t have to pay for gas money 
and struggle to find parking spaces. They can also help the environment by helping to reduce pollution in the air,” Pennington said. 
The One Less Car Challenge is also 
directed toward making people more 
physically active.
UF Senior V eronica Urdaneta said 
riding her bike to school is a simple 
form of exercise for her. 
“I’m not only helping out the envi-
ronment, but I’m also doing good to my body by riding my bike around on campus,” she said. 
Students who visited the fair walked 
away with T-shirts, alligator-shaped erasers and other goodies from the dif-ferent displays, in addition to being able to test drive the bikes. 
The American Solar Energy Society 
showcased Photon, a solar-powered tricycle. 
“There are so many options to get 
around campus besides driving a car, 
and Photon is proof that getting around 
can be interesting,” said  UF senior Sammy Shams.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 2010

Gainesville Internet providers like Cox Commu -
nications, Gainesville DSL and Gator.Net advertise 
lightning-fast service; however, consumers are find-ing that their Internet access isn’t always as fast as it is advertised to be.
A new report by the Federal Communications 
Commission shows that users are paying for speeds of 7-8 megabits per second on average, but are receiv-ing only about half the speed they expect, usually around 4 Mbps. 
“Cable modems can be problematic,” said Jeff 
Shelton, a customer service support specialist at Gator.Net. “They can be affected by the weather and humidity. It’s the same thing with DSL.”
While advertisers are able to use the maximum 
speeds that their service may reach, service can slow 
down because of net congestion — a long delay between the server’s transmission and the consumer’s reception of information.
Though many users may not 
realize their Internet service is slower than adver -
tised, some residents are trying to change the way Gainesville receives its Internet. 
Dave Pokorney of UF Computing & Networking 
Services is campaigning for Google to build a fiber network in Gainesville, which would deliver data transfer rates of 1 gigabit per second.  
“I’m very hopeful that it comes to Gainesville,”  
Pokorney said. ”This will make Cox and DSL look like dial-up does now.”
Though many cities are competing to be the home 
of Google’s gigabit fiber, Gainesville is a strong con-tender with help from groups like Gig 4 Gainesville.
If users want to check their Internet speed at home, 
they can test it at www.speedtest.net.Area Internet may

Melissa Pender can be described as a 
gym regular. Five days a week, she, like 
many other UF students, travels to South-
west Recreation Center to take advantage of all the state-of-the-art equipment. 
However, Pender has been plagued with 
a recurring problem that has hindered her 
workout plans—a lack of ID. Without her 
Gator 1 Card, Pender can’t enter the gym.
“I must have lost mine at least three 
times since freshman year,” said Pender, a 
journalism junior.
Now, as part of Southwest Rec’s recent multi-million dollar renovation, students such as Pender won’t need to worry about 
missing a workout due to a lost student ID. 
Instead of waiting in line to get their 
Gator 1 Cards swiped, students can enter Southwest Rec by punching in their UF ID numbers and placing their hand on the gym’s newly installed HandKeys. 
David Bowles, the director of the De-
partment of Recreational Sports at UF, said the staff had to undergo training to learn the HandKey software. 
In less than two weeks, more than 
10,000 students have enrolled in the sys-tem to use the HandKeys, said Pamela Hightower, coordinator of operations for UF’s Department of Recreational Sports. Hightower said about 400 new students enroll a day. 
With thousands of hands touching each 
machine a day some students have ex-pressed concerns about the sanitation of the HandKeys.“I never really thought about the clean-
liness until I saw a really sweaty guy use the HandKey right before me,” said Matt Heller, a freshman at UF.
Hightower said these students do not 
have to worry. The surfaces of the Hand-Keys are built with BioCote, an anti-micro-bial surface.
The HandKeys also undergo special-
ized weekly cleaning.
Although the technology is relatively 
new to UF, Southwest Rec officials remain optimistic the new feature will catch on.  
“These HandKeys have the potential 
to be very useful in a lot of applications around campus,” Bowles said.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
A man who railed against the 
Discovery Channel's environmental 
programming for years burst into the company's headquarters with at least one explosive device strapped 
to his body Wednesday and took 
three people hostage at gunpoint before police shot him to death, of-ficials said.
The hostages — two Discovery 
Communications employees and a security guard — were unhurt after the four-hour standoff. Montgom-ery County Police Chief Thomas 
Manger said tactical officers moved 
in after officers monitoring the gun-man on building security cameras saw him pull out a handgun and point it at a hostage.
An explosive device on the gun-
man's body detonat-ed when police shot him, Manger said. 
Police were trying 
to determine whether two boxes 
and two backpacks the gunman had also contained explosives.
A law enforcement official speak-
ing on condition of anonymity be-cause the investigation was ongoing said authorities had identified James J. Lee as the likely suspect. Police had 
not released the gunman's identity.
County Police and firefighters 
Wednesday night looked at a lap-
top screen that showed an image of a body lying face-up, surrounded by blood. Authorities also sent in a robot to disarm the explosive on the gunman's body . Police Capt. Paul Starks said the suspect had shot a 
gun at least once. He also said police 
believe the suspect was acting alone but are investigating all possibili-ties.
NBC News reported that after its 
producers called Discovery's gen-eral number, a man identifying him-self as James J. Lee got on the phone 
and said he had a gun and several 
bombs.
"I have several bombs strapped 
to my body ready to go off. I have a device that if I drop it, if I drop it, it will ... explode," the man told NBC.
He said he built the bombs in about three weeks. "I did a lot of 
research. I had to experiment," he 
said.
Manger said the suspect held the 
hostages in the lobby area of the first floor. Authorities said they will me-thodically go through the building and identify any suspicious items.Manger said police spent several 
hours negotiating with the armed man after he entered the suburban Washington building about 1 p.m. None of the 1,900 people who work in the building were hurt, and most made it out before the standoff end-
ed.
Lee was convicted of disorderly 
conduct for a protest he organized 
outside Discovery's offices in Febru-ary 2008. According to court records, he paid homeless people to carry signs and set off a scramble when he threw fistfuls of cash into the air, calling it "just trash."
Lee served two weeks in jail af-
ter his arrest during which doctors evaluated his competency to stand trial. 
County State's Attorney John 
McCarthy said Lee was ordered to stay 500 feet away from Discovery headquarters as part of his proba-tion, which ended two weeks ago. A magistrate ordered a doctor's evalu-
ation, but the result was not imme-
diately available Wednesday.
"The Discovery Channel produc-
es many so-called 'Environmental Programs' supposedly there to save the planet," Lee said in an ad he took out in a Washington newspaper to promote the protest. "But the truth is things are getting WORSE! Their 
programs are causing more harm 
than good."
David Leavy, Discovery's execu-
tive vice president for corporate af-fairs, said all employees had been accounted for. "We're relieved that it ended without any harm to our em-ployees," he said.THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 5

� THE MOSQUE PLANNED NEAR GROUND ZERO.
By HANNAH LEACH
Alligator Contributing Writer
Although hundreds of miles separate Gainesville from 
the site of the proposed mosque near Ground Zero, the is-
sue resonates deeply for many Gainesville residents.
Local religious representatives are weighing in on the 
mosque, which has sparked much debate nationally as to 
whether an Islamic place of worship should be built near 
the site of the Sept. 11 attacks.
Ismail ibn Ali, the president of Islam on Campus, be-
lieves that having a mosque near Ground Zero is a good idea. 
After hearing about the proposed mosque, Ali said that 
he never thought the location would cause such a contro-versy. 
“I see it as another building close by,” he said.Members of other religious faiths, such as Kristi Col-
son, the president of the Christian Student Association, believes Americans, no matter what their religious prefer -
ences, should be able to practice freely. 
For Colson, the Sept. 11 attacks are not a reflection of 
the Muslim faith as a whole.  
“The Sept. 11 acts were done out of reli-
gious zeal, but I trust that not all of them are like this,” Colson said.  
Others, such as Keith Dvorchik, the execu-
tive director of Hillel, had a hard time forming an opinion regarding the issue. 
Initially, Dvorchik felt conflicting opinions when hear -
ing about the anticipated mosque and Islamic center. He said the terrorist attacks still strike powerful emotions with the public and placing a mosque near this site is very controversial. 
He admitted to feeling a little skeptical at first about 
the prospect of having a mosque so close to Ground Zero given the political implications. 
However, after doing some personal research, he said 
the public needs to remember that not all Muslims are ter -
rorists. 
“They have every right to [build] it there,” he said. One of the things that made him come around was that 
he believed the mosque would focus more on the commu-nity aspect and would have a positive impact.  
Dvorchik believes that the ability to practice one’s re-
ligion without fear of repercussion is something that, no matter what one's faith, should be respected.
“The beauty of America is that they have the  right to 
do it there,” Dvorchik said.Campus, local groups weigh in on NYC mosque

Today’s question: Have you ever

89 TOTAL VOTES28% YES72% NOWednesday’s question: Are you in favor of the biomass plant?Ta-Ta Tussel
Sometimes it’s funny to 
remember that states like South Dakota still 
exist when they’re brought into the news.
And sometimes it’s even 
funnier to read why they’re in the news.
This week, a high school 
near Sioux Falls, S.D., banned a bracelet aiming to promote cancer awareness — a bracelet that does so with the slogan “I love boobies.” 
The brazen bracelets have 
caused controversy in other states across the country, in-cluding our very own Sun-shine State. 
The South Dakota girl ac-
cused of a major dress-code violation worse than those “Female Body Inspector” T-
shirts has a history of breast 
cancer in her family , and she says she was simply trying to bring attention to the issue af-flicting her family . 
The issue at hand is not whether people love boobies — clearly a vast majority do — but whether school-aged children maintain their right to free speech within a public 
school setting.
Clearly , they don’t. 
This very same issue be-
came national news when Gainesville children came to school with T-shirts that said “Islam is of the Devil.”
And although the issues of 
boobies and supposed Satanic 
Muslims are a little bit differ -
ent, the concept is the same. 
We doubt a little bosom-lov-ing bracelet action distracted students, and we support the cause behind the bracelets as well as a student’s right to ex-press their beliefs as they so choose. 
All in all, we want to save 
the Ta Tas as much as anyone else. And, really , there’s not much more to write about South Dakota if we’re not talk-ing about Mount Rushmore.

Obama undertakes   
Mid-East peace talks
You can’t say the man doesn’t have goals.
As President Obama announced the end of the  Amer -
ican combat mission in Iraq from the fancy-schmancy, 
newly decorated Oval Office in his address to the nation Tues-
day evening, an onslaught of new issues came forward. 
Topping that list were revamping the economy because ap-
parently stimulus packages, national rebate programs and fi-
nancial bailouts were not enough to get us to buy stuff; success-
fully ending America’s mission in Afghanistan; and ending the nebulously defined War On Terror.
And if that wasn’t enough to fill one man’s plate, President 
Obama wants to, for real this time, bring peace to the Middle 
East. 
Is it us or are these peace pow-wows becoming more and 
more like trying to sit through “The Neverending Story” every 
year? 
We’re with you, Mr. President. We love peace more than 
$5 footlongs (how’s that for a stimulus plan?). In fact, we feel the world could use maybe even a little bit more of that whole peace thing. 
But how realistic are these talks? 
It doesn’t typically spell out a clean agreement when both 
warring parties are largely opposed to substantial compromise. 
Since the beginning of time, well, no, more like since the 
U.N. bullied its way through the Middle East and gave Israel its 
own state, our newspapers, radios and TVs have been plagued with reports of war in the Middle East. 
We can only hope President Obama has a few tricks up his 
sleeve because that’s exactly what the world needs right now – 
a little magic. 
Allow me to begin by lobbing a grenade into the mine 
field.
I believe our country’s founding is inseparable 
from Judeo-Christian philosophies.
However, it is also an American’s right to hold himself to 
the tenets, philosophies and practices of any religion, spiritu-ality or non-religion he deems appropriate.
Recently, the “Restoring Honor” rally was hosted in Wash-
ington, D.C., with reports of more than 100,000 people from all demographics and backgrounds attending. The speakers reminded those listening to rely on God for relief from the burdens of life and associated hardships.
However, the fiery debate still rages between those who 
seek to eradicate all traces of Judeo-Christian philosophy 
from our government and those who seek to preserve those 
principles.
To separate the idea of civil rights from the Judeo-Chris-
tian principle of moral obligation and the idea of a higher power is to devalue our liberty as Americans. As Alexander Hamilton argued, to separate the two concepts is “the most manifest violation of justice.” Espoused by Enlightenment philosophers such as John Locke and as stated in the Decla-ration of Independence, the rights to life and liberty are or -
dained from no less a power than God.
A 2007 Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life study 
found that about 75 percent of Americans are either religious or take no offense to public mentions of God on currency , monuments, etc. However, we still find our legal system entangled in cases to remove “under God” from the Pledge of Allegiance and to ban Bible study clubs from public high schools.
Yes, the classic separation-of-church-and-state argument 
has to come into play somewhere. Let’s deconstruct this ar -
gument. The exact term “separation of church and state” is found nowhere within America’s founding documents. In-stead, Thomas Jefferson used the phrase to alleviate the con-cerns of a Baptist ministry that America would be prone to adopt a specific Christian denomina-tion. Jefferson makes the same point I would advocate by using that phrase. Essentially, he points out there is to be no specified or accepted practice of re-
ligion by the government. 
This does not mean, however, 
our government cannot adhere to 
the Judeo-Christian philosophy in its operation. The wording of the First 
Amendment supports such an idea, as well. The establish-ment and freedom of exercise clauses prevent specification on the part of the government.
At this point, I must caution us to the danger of separat-
ing God from government. If the secularist movement pre-vails and the idea of “inalienable natural rights as granted by God” is defeated, then what is to prevent the reinstitution of slavery or discrimination at the behest of a majority? When men are left to determine the rights of one another, those rights are in serious jeopardy . 
In summation, this issue is of paramount importance to 
each of us, and at such a tumultuous point in American his-tory we should all be standing up for the continued recogni-
tion of our inalienable natural rights, as endowed by God.
The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., in his famous “Letter 
from a Birmingham Jail,” referred to “our constitutional and 
God-given rights.” In that same letter, he also said those en-gaged in the civil rights movement were “standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judeo-Christian heritage.”
If we continue to diminish the role of religion in our politi-
cal dialogue and exclude its manifestations from our public 
affairs, we will lose the essential foundation of our American 
rights and freedoms. Our natural rights are our foundation, our backbone, our promise and our future.

As a UF student, you might take 
it for granted that you can visit your loved ones whenever you 
like. It takes but a single call to arrange a visit, a simple drive or, at most, a flight or two. Even if you are an inter -
national student, you can plan in ad-
vance to visit your family back home 
during summer or semester breaks.  
But this is not true for all UF stu-
dents.  Being able to visit their families back home is far out of the imagina-
tion and reach for some international 
students. This is not because of finan-cial difficulties, but instead because of their U.S. visa type. 
Iranian students are subject to sin-
gle-entry U.S. visas only. This means they are only allowed to enter the United States once. If they decide to leave, for any reason, they must re-ap-
ply for a U.S. visa, which means going 
through a long and cumbersome ad-ministrative process again that might take anywhere from a few weeks to a 
year.
Iranian students who dared to trav-
el outside the U.S. during their stud-
ies here, have, many times, ended up losing a semester or two, or even their 
assistantship positions simply because 
of this unfair policy. Some even end up saying goodbye to their unfinished studies in the U.S. What makes the 
problem even worse is the U.S. has no 
embassy in Iran, an issue that forces students to travel to a third country in order to renew their visas. 
This policy is a result of the bitter 
relationship between the U.S. and Ira-nian governments, which has roots in historical events, including the CIA-backed coup in 1953 that overthrew the 
democratically elected prime minister 
of Iran and the hostage-taking crisis at the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979 fol-lowing the Islamic revolution in Iran.
Some American politicians say this is a recip-rocal policy in response to the 
same situation 
Americans face 
if they travel to Iran. 
However, this is not true. First, 
while it is true ran does not offer a multiple-entry visa to U.S. citizens, it does however, allow them to leave and return to the country for a period of three months without obtaining a 
new visa. Also, all foreign nationals, 
including Americans, can renew their expired visas inside Iran, a privilege that Iranian students don’t have in the 
U.S.
The single-entry visa policy for Ira-
nian students contradicts even what 
President Obama pledged in his mes-sage to Iranians on March 20,  saying 
“…even as we continue to have differ -
ences with the Iranian government, we 
will sustain our commitment to a more hopeful future for the Iranian people. 
For instance, by increasing opportuni-
ties for educational exchanges so that Iranian students can come to our col-leges and universities.”
To sum up, Iranians are very family 
and community-oriented people, and this harsh policy subjects Iranian stu-dents at UF and all other universities in the U.S. to unnecessary stress and 
frustration. 
Imagine not being able to visit your 
family for four years. Is that really 
fair? Only hope keeps inspiring Irani-an students to stay rather than return 
home. Hope for obtaining competence 
by studying at high-standard Ameri-can universities, and hope for the day when tensions between the two gov-
ernments ease and mutual interests of 
their citizens are valued.

Speaking Out
The blare of heavy artillery could be heard across Ari-
zona last week as the state’s Republican senatorial pri-mary candidates battled for their political lives. When 
the final rounds were fired and the smoke had cleared, one man emerged victorious.
Vietnam War veteran, 2008 Republican presidential nomi-
nee and four-term United States Sen. John McCain claimed vic-tory in last week’s primary. He will now face off against Demo-cratic nominee Rodney Glassman in hopes of serving his fifth, and quite possibly final, term as Arizona’s senator.
Unfortunately , McCain’s triumph in this primary election 
has proven that he is willing to do anything, perhaps even sell his soul to the devil, if it will forward his political career. It is clear that the man who once proudly declared himself a “mav-erick” is no longer worthy of the title.
Fervent anti-incumbent sentiment and distrust of the 
Washington establishment has made this election cycle espe-cially difficult for politicians like John McCain, who has served more than 20 years in Congress. The fact that McCain was once among the most moderate members of the Republican Party has only added fuel to the flame.
The GOP is currently undergoing a purge. Moderate 
members of the party , such as McCain, are being ousted and replaced by more conservative and, in some cases, more radi-cal right-wing candidates. This purge is typified by the emergence of the Tea Party, a far-right, anti-big government political movement whose agenda, 
among other things, includes promoting racial intolerance and finding the President’s Kenyan birth certificate.
Any Republican incumbent seeking re-election who is not 
Tea Party-certified faces the risk of losing his or her conserva-tive credentials as well as a seat in the legislature. McCain and his opponent J.D. Hayworth both received Tea Party endorse-ments, but apparently McCain didn’t believe being endorsed by a cabal of conspiratorial racists was enough to win a re-election.
In order to appease his political base, which has been cor -
rupted by the Tea Party movement, McCain has disavowed many of the political positions that set him apart from his counterparts. His stances on climate change, cap and trade, im-migration, campaign finance reform and “don’t ask, don’t tell” gained him the reputation as one of the most centrist mem-bers of the Republican Party, though he has flip-flopped on nearly all of these issues now that an election cycle has rolled around.
McCain’s sudden change of heart on the issue of immigra-
tion and amnesty caused a kerfuffle. In fact, the Hayworth campaign made amnesty the centerpiece of their anti-McCain crusade. But oddly enough, McCain now claims he never sup-ported amnesty.
Apparently he wants his constituents to forget that he co-
sponsored a comprehensive immigration reform bill with the very liberal Ted Kennedy that proposed, yes, an amnesty program for more than 12 million illegal immigrants. Now, McCain can be seen in overly-dramatic and poorly-produced campaign ads promising to build a “danged fence”.
Furthermore, his support of the draconian SB 1070 has 
thrown many for a loop. How can a man who was at one point a proponent of amnesty come out in support of an immigra-tion law that turns Arizona’s police force into the Gestapo?
We all remember the 2008 presidential election when John 
McCain and the “Disasta from Alaska” drove onto the political stage in their “Straight Talk Express” being all “mavericky.” A maverick is defined as “someone who exhibits great indepen-dence in thought and action.” 
A maverick does not pander to his base, nor does he seek 
to appease an unorganized political movement destined to be tossed into the trash heap of history.
John McCain is not a maverick. He is a sell-out, willing to 
sacrifice his principles in order to fulfill his political ambitions.

It all started on Christmas in 
1994 with a pair of guitars, an Aero -
smith record and a Tom Petty and 
the Heartbreakers tablature book.
Throw in years of absorbing The 
Beatles, The Flaming Lips and soul greats like Otis Redding and Curtis Mayfield, and the education of Morn-ingbell’s brother duo Travis and Eric Atria was complete.
The Gainesville-based group, 
known for its psychedelic power-pop anthems and charm, is a family af-
fair for the Atria brothers. With Travis 
covering vocals and guitar and Eric on bass, they share the stage with drummer Chris Hillman and key -
boardist Stacie Atria (Eric’s wife).
The band is playing Common 
Grounds Friday to mark the digital release of “Sun Come Out,” a new EP featuring songs from the ses-
sions from its 2009 outing, “Sin-
cerely, Severely,” and for anyone who’s ever been a face in the crowd at a Morningbell show, it’s in the air: brotherly love.
And it’s taken time for the broth-
ers to refine their roles in the band. Travis is the artistic force. As the songwriter for the band, the younger 
Atria says his music has become 
more accessible, with lyrics that are less about outer space and more about life, love and sex.
“There’s more body. There’s 
more of a physicality to the music,” he said. “I wanted to make some -thing that was undeniable.”
They agree their brotherly bond 
over music has only made chasing their artistic dreams easier.
“For us, it’s like the thing that 
keeps us going,” Eric said. “When we go on tour, we know how to live with each other.”It could be surviving an on-stage 
hiccup or guiding a two-car caravan through New York City traffic. Either way, the Atria brothers take advan-tage of their family ties.
“We have a language between 
us,” Travis said.
The chemistry of the band as a 
whole is tangible on stage. Eric re -
counted a time when drummer Hill-
man missed a beat during a show. 
The band was able to adjust, in lock -
step, to the rhythm with just a split-second glance at one another.
And it’s this chemistry that has 
guided the band through what Tra-vis amusingly calls an “adolescent fantasy.” The band saw “Sincerely, Severely” attract national attention 
and bigger gigs. Since its release in 
December, Morningbell has played large-scale music festivals like South by Southwest and Bonnaroo, and they’ve had more critical acclaim than ever before.
“It feels like we’re just starting, in 
a way,” Travis said.
After nearly 10 years of paying 
dues, they found that their enthusi-asm has crowds erupting at festivals just as they do in small clubs.

Why does my man like men?
Dear Jared,
I made a little discovery the other day — 
and by that I mean I caught my boyfriend 
looking at gay porn. Awkwardness aside, where do we go from here? Is he definitely gay? 
–Confused and Concerned First and foremost, let me take the time to 
congratulate you and your Nancy Drew skills for catching your man-on-man-admiring, porn-addict -
ed boyfriend. Those frat guys (this is, of course, a complete assumption) are usually uber secretive about their “Adam4Adam” dating site profiles with a blurred-out headshot and a call for “discreet bot-toms only.”
And now to get to the bottom of your question 
(pun intended). Your response, after the initial awkwardness of watching your boyfriend get his jollies off of another man’s jollies, should depend on what you caught him clicking his mouse to. 
If we’re talking about some form of hardcore 
back-door action, then yes, perhaps you should be a little alarmed. 
But if your Sperry-wearing, too-busy-to-hang-
out-with-you-because-he’s-”rushing” boyfriend was caught in the act watching a clip of softcore, no-big-deal, naked vacuuming – with a little soft petting and second-base action – perhaps he’s just trying to bone up on his skills or even learn something new to impress you with in the bedroom. 
No, I’m totally kidding. 
He’s most definitely gayer than your Bichon Frise’s pink fur bows either way you look at it. As awkward as it might be, have you talked with him about it? 
Although you can’t assume your boyfriend is gay 
(I mean, he is, but don’t just assume it), maybe this cat-out-of-the-bag “accident” was the best thing to 
happen to him. Coming out, especially to one’s girl-
friend or boyfriend, is an emotional process that requires the utmost sensitivity.
Hopefully, he won’t react with hostility at the 
insinuation he enjoys a good circle jerk more than your intimate company, and, hopefully, this will turn into a productive conversation for both of you that will enhance your friendship, not ruin it. 
And look on the bright side: Now you will always 
have a truthful answer when you ask him if your ass looks fat in your favorite dress.

Last Friday, Mayor Craig Lowe 
came out, again, and in brilliant 
colors.
Gainesville’s first openly gay 
mayor has been immortalized by 
one of the city’s most enigmatic 
artists, Tom Miller, and the portrait was unveiled at local gay mecca University Club.
Miller, a 44-year-old jack-of-all-
trades who calls himself a “shitty artist,” has painted prominent Gainesville figures before, including former Mayor Pegeen Hanrahan 
and former Police Chief Wayland 
Clifton. 
But for Miller, this portrait hits 
deeper and is more personal, an homage to someone he sees as a local hero.
“He is somebody who will listen 
to anybody in this town no matter who you are or where you came 
from,” he said. The portrait is a 
mixed-media piece that depicts the mayor as a strong, proud figure, standing with his arms crossed and his head looking forward and up, as if to the future. 
His body is a black and white 
picture pasted over large, horizon-tal stripes of the gay flag colors. His 
tie has been cut out so that the un-
derlying colors shine through.
“This is my way of honoring him 
and letting him know that the art-ists in town like him, or at least I do,” Miller said.

Mafia 2 incites violence and infuriates  
by JON SILMAN
avenue staff writer
Not being able to punch women makes me 
want to punch a woman.
Before you call the cops on me, let me explain. 
“Mafia 2” was one of the most highly anticipated 
video games of the last fiscal quarter. It had all the 
makings of an epic mobster melodrama some-
where between “Scarface” and “The Godfather.” (And it was playable, too! Sweet Jesus.) 
All 2K Games had to do was improve on the 
first one a bit, and they’d have a winner. 
What they did, however, was not that. Why does this game suck so much? All I know 
is I tried to play this travesty of a game and by the end of the first hour, I was contemplating suicide.“Mafia 2” is an open sandbox game like 
“Grand Theft Auto.”  This is supposed to supply the player with a sense of freedom — a way to con-trol your own destiny without being put on a re -
peat violence/sex offender list. But  there are no side missions.  
In “Mafia 2,” you can buy clothes. And all the real mis-sions are “drive to this ware -
house and then drive back.” 
If I wanted to drive all day, I’d 
deliver pizzas. 
Also in this bomb, losing the cops is impossible.  
If you shoot someone, somehow those 1940s po-licemen have GPS tracking devices and transpor -
tation machines. So the game tells you to change clothes to lose your wanted level but you can’t go into the clothes store with one. And you can’t buy 
new clothes ‘cause you’re wanted, so you have 
to steal them and (naturally) shoot the cashier, which gives you a different kind of wanted level. Then you steal a car and get a third type of wanted level. Then you die, and when you restart you’re still wanted by the cops. Then your girlfriend gets mad at you ‘cause you kicked the dog. My final 
gripe: you can’t punch women. I’m not a propo-nent of this in real life, but it’s a video game.
Part of the fun of “Grand Theft Auto” was get-
ting prostitutes and then (naturally) beating them. I mean, our guy is a mobster. Since when are they shining beacons of chivalry? 
In conclusion, this game blows harder than 
Katrina did. I suggest you poop in a box and send 2K Games a stinker of your own.

TEEING OFF WITH ANTHONY CHIANG UF FOOTBALL alligatorSports PodcastsBy TYLER JETT
Alligator Staff Writer
tjett@alligator.org
 
Jaye Howard expects to get his hands on 
ball carriers more often this season, thanks 
to the leadership of first-year defensive co-ordinator Teryl Austin, .
Howard said his role in the past, along 
with that of the rest of the defensive line-men, has been to merely occupy blockers so the Gators’ linebackers could roam un-touched.
“We had a freak back there in Brandon 
Spikes and we were just holding [offensive lineman] up for him, letting him do his thing,” said Howard, who has recorded 37 
tackles in two seasons.
But this year Austin wants his lineman 
to shed more blocks and get their own tack-

“Anybody that’s on the field for us, they 
have to be able to make plays,” he said. “You have to do your job, and sometimes that requires holding the gap and then get-ting off to make a play.”
Howard will have an even greater 
chance to get his name on stat sheets when he moves to defensive end, a spot he said he will occupy in some of Florida’s pack-ages this season. He expects the team to run multiple formations when Florida plays Alabama Oct. 2.
Although he said he likes the chance 
to mix his assignments, Howard would have been more excited about the move as a freshman. Entering school weighing just 230 pounds, Howard said he used to 
hang around the salad bar to keep weight 
off, hoping to avoid becoming an interior lineman.
But, three years and about 80 pounds 
later, he now prefers playing inside and the contact that goes along with the posi-tion. He credits his weight gain to workouts 
with strength coach Mickey Marotti and 
“pancake diets” at the dining hall.
“You eat like a pig out there,” Howard 
said. “I’m not used to eating that much.”
Austin on recruiting: Austin has not 
coached college football since leaving Mich-igan for the NFL in 2002. He said staying on the phones and in the living rooms of high school prospects has been the most notable 
adjustment he’s had to make. 
He’s noticed an increased amount of at-
tention to recruiting websites 
and televised all-star games since joining the professional ranks.
“You never had to deal 
with that before,” he said. “You had guys, usually, com-
ing in just trying to earn their way. With all the media stuff, sometimes they get like, ‘Hey, you’re ready to go.’ But they really don’t quite understand what it takes to be a college football player.”
Jones moving around: The Gators have 
used all their linebackers at the strongside, weakside and middle positions through-out the preseason in an effort to make each player more versatile.
But A.J. Jones is the only member of the 
unit the coaches feel comfortable enough to 
play at all three positions in games this sea-
son, coach Urban Meyer said Wednesday. Last year, Ryan Stamper played a similar role.
“A.J. Jones is basically our Stamper,” Meyer said.
Still no second corner: Jeremy Brown 
and Moses Jenkins have been neck-and-neck for the starting cornerback position opposite Janoris Jenkins, and Austin said the decision will not be made until shortly before Florida’s season opener noon Satur -
day against Miami (Ohio).

It was the best birthday present 
assistant coach Dave Boos could 
ever ask for. 
With his team leading 14-12 in 
a decisive fifth set, juniors Kelly 
Murphy and Cassandra Anderson 
leaped in the air and sent the attack 
of Nebraska outside hitter Han-nah Werth plummeting back to the floor, lifting the No. 6 Gators to a victory over the then-No. 2 Huskers 
and their first win against a top-two 
team since 2003. “We joked beforehand that the 
team was going to win the match for my birthday,” Boos said. “It was re-
ally nice to be able to have the team 
play so well that day.”
Sunday’s victory was significant 
for Boos due to more than just tim-
ing. His newly installed defense led 
to not just the win over Nebraska but also Saturday’s victory against Iowa State. 
Despite not boasting a player 
taller than 6-foot-2, the Gators out blocked a Nebraska team featuring 6-foot-5 Morgan Broekhuis, 6-foot-5 Lindsey Licht, 6-foot-4 Brooke Dela-
no and 6-foot-3 Allison McNeal by a count of 14 to 9. 
In its three most recent matches 
against Nebraska, UF had never come within seven blocks of the 
Huskers. 
“That was one of the key statis-
tics and we’ve 
seen it year in 
and year out in 
volleyball,” UF coach Mary Wise said. “Blocking is 
one of the really 
key skills needed to play at an elite 
level.”
Boos joined the program in the offseason to try to help the Gators excel in this crucial area, and the switch to his system appears to be 
paying immediate dividends. 
Although a number of schools 
run a variation of the scheme Boos 
employs, very few, if any, do it ex-
actly like he does.
“It’s basically a way to have the 
front court and back court be very 
coordinated together as a defense,” Boos said. “It allows us to take calcu-
lated blocking risks during a match, 
and this weekend I thought that the players did a fantastic job of execut-ing what the gameplan was.” 
Although the players and coach-es agree there is still plenty of room for improvement as the season pro-gresses, Florida’s 2-0 showing at the 
Runza/American Volleyball Coach-
es Association Showcase proves the system has the potential to be every-thing the team hoped it would. 
“When the whole thing starts 
clicking together we should have six people responding as a unit, and that’s the ultimate goal by the end of the season,” Boos said.

ren Bledsoe and Anderson may have the most difficult time mak-ing the transition, as the pair is now

Mike Haywood knows how difficult it 
is to play in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium.
Before he became the coach at Miami 
(Ohio), Haywood spent eight seasons as 
an assistant coach at Florida’s conference rival LSU.
After visiting Gainesville four times 
as a coach, Haywood is well aware of the difficulties his team will face when it goes up against No. 4 Florida on Saturday at noon.
“We talked to our guys about going in 
and embracing the atmosphere,” he said. “We are doing things in practice to give us an advantage, like silent cadence and dif-ferent things so we really don’t need ca-dences on offense so we can get the ball 
snapped appropriately.”
The Redhawks are coming off 
of a one-win season, but quarter -
back Zac Dysert has instilled hope.  
The sophomore signal-caller threw for 
2,611 yards last year in 11 games, while 
also racking up a career-best 426 passing 
yards against Temple last season. His play 
has led others to compare Dysert to Miami 
(Ohio) great Ben Roethlisberger, but his coach isn’t going that far.
“Due to his knowledge of the offense, 
[Zac] has become a leader on the field and off the field,” Haywood said. 
“He has the potential and as long as he stays on track – I wouldn’t compare him to [Roethlisberger] because he has a couple of Super Bowls – but he is progressing on 
that line where he can be a quality NFL 
football player.”
However, Haywood 
wants to take pressure off Dysert by developing a rushing attack early in the 
season. The good news is 
the team’s leading rusher, 
Thomas Merriweather, 
returns this year. The bad news is he only accumu-lated 291 yards in 2009.
“Offensively, we are coming together 
a lot better,” Haywood said. “Dysert is leading us at quarterback, Merriweather at running back and we are still trying to solidify our offensive line at this point.”
On the defensive side of the ball, the 
Redhawks will try to improve after allow-ing 34.2 points per game last season. 
They return middle linebacker Jerrell 
Wedge, who led the Mid-American Con-ference with 18.5 tackles for a loss last year.
Still, Florida running back Jeff Demps 
could be in line for a big day Saturday as 
Miami (Ohio) struggled to stop the run 
in 2009, allowing 186.9 rushing yards per game.
“Florida is a team with tremendous 
speed and we have to make sure we find a way to slow this football game down and limit their possessions,” Haywood said.Redhawks to play Gators fresh off one-win season
Haywood
Bledsoe getting used to middle blocker spot
expected to read the other team’s attack and coordinate 
UF’s response, both of which are responsibilities they didn’t have to worry about last season. 
But Florida’s two starters have taken the new chal-
lenges in stride. And after such a successful opening tournament, they have no doubts that the move was a smart one.
“I think everyone is responding to it really well, and 
after seeing it this weekend it completely makes sense,” Bledsoe said. “Nobody has any problems following along and jumping on board with it.”
Anderson has been a consistent force at middle 
blocker over her first two years, leading the team in blocks both seasons.
Bledsoe, on the other hand, is relatively new to the 
middle blocker position after spending the majority of 
her time at outside hitter last season. 
Her first match on the interior came on Nov . 20 
against Tennessee, when Florida had just four matches left in its regular season. 
Bledsoe seized the opportunity , recording 45 kills, 
four solo blocks and 18 block assists in her final seven contests while earning a full-time spot at middle blocker 
in 2010. 
After a full offseason of work at the position, Bled-
soe expects her play to be even stronger than it was last 
year. 
“It definitely helps to have one position and to have 
something to really focus on,” she said. “To be able to 
work on just one thing versus everything will always help.”VOLLEY , from page 18

THE ASSOcIATED PRESS
 
LOUISVILLE, Ky.  — Louisville athletic director Tom Ju-
rich heard the rumblings four years ago when he led the push 
to expand Cardinal Stadium.
Even though the program was in the midst of a record-
breaking season in which it eventually won the Big East title 
and the Orange Bowl, Jurich knew some wondered if there 
really was a need to spend millions upgrading a stadium that 
was less than a decade old at the time.
“I took a lot of criticism, like ‘what’s this idiot doing?’” Ju-
rich said.
Construction continued even as the program and the econ-
omy faltered. When Louisville and new coach Charlie Strong 
take the field against Kentucky on Saturday in the Governor’s 
Cup, the Cardinals will do it in front of a sellout crowd of over 
56,000.
The facelift includes 33 new luxury suites, over 1,700 club 
seats, an upper deck with 13,000 chairback seats and a south 
terrace that provides a view of the twin spires at nearby 
Churchill Downs.
“It’s a big-time looking stadium right now,” Jurich said. 
“This puts us in an elite group.”
To keep up in the Big East these days, it’s part of the game.
Five years after the conference was left on life support after 
Virginia Tech, Miami and Boston College bolted for the Atlan-tic Coast Conference, the Big East is thriving both on the field 
and at the gate.
Rutgers finished a $100 million renovation of its football 
complex last year.
“Since the reorganization, I think every school without ex-
ception has made a commitment to improving all facilities,” 
said Rutgers coach Greg Schiano. “It’s paramount for the con-
tinued growth of our league.”
And interest is growing.Average attendance in the Big East last year was higher 
than it was before Boston College split following the 2004 sea-son. The current lineup averaged 44,804 fans a game in 2009, 
compared to 37,805 in 2004. Those numbers are skewed a bit 
by Temple, which averaged just over 16,000 fans during it’s 
final year in the conference.
Why the uptick in a conference prematurely pronounced 
dead a few times? Winning helps.
Schiano has revitalized Rutgers. West Virginia has won a 
pair of BCS bowls. South Florida has beaten the likes of Florida State to carve out a niche in the football-heavy Sunshine State.
Though Big East teams don’t play in the sprawling palaces 
that can be found in places like the Southeastern Conference, 
that’s not necessarily a bad thing.Big East boasts

 CORAL GABLES — Miami is looking to 
play at Yankee Stadium.
  Hurricanes athletic director Kirby Hocutt 
engaged in talks with New York Yankees of-
ﬁ  cials Tuesday and Wednesday about the 
possibility of Miami playing in the team’s new ballpark during the 2013 season, and emerged believing an agreement could be struck.
  “I feel conﬁ  dent to say the Miami Hurri-
canes are going to have a presence in New York City,” Hocutt told The Associated Press.
  No potential date, or opponent, has been 
revealed, although it’s likely any game would take place in November because of the baseball playoff schedule. Hocutt said there are “a couple options” on the table, but stressed he wants to make sure any deal is the right ﬁ  t.
  “There’s obviously a desire on our part to 
get up into this market,” Hocutt said. “The 
Yankee organization, they’ve expressed 
their interest and desire to have the game in the stadium. So I’m conﬁ  dent that there’s in-terest on both sides.”
  Miami already has 10 games — ﬁ  ve home, 
ﬁ  ve away — scheduled for 2013, eight of them being Atlantic Coast Conference matchups. The Hurricanes plan to host Florida on Sept. 7, 2013. Miami is scheduled to visit South Florida on Nov. 30 of that year in Tampa, the Yankees’ spring training home.
  That leaves two non-conference dates for 
the Hurricanes still to ﬁ  ll, and if the Yankee Stadium plan comes together, their likely preference would be to make the sixth road game of the year a neutral-site contest in New York.
  “I think it’s great for college football 
and the University of Miami,” coach Randy Shannon said. “You play teams outside of the conference a lot ... and it’s an opportu-nity for us to be in the Northeast, which is a big University of Miami alumni base area.”
  Miami has already added one marquee 
non-conference, neutral-site game to its 
upcoming schedule. The 
Hurricanes will play Notre 
Dame at Chicago’s Soldier Field in 2012.
  There’s a number of ties between the Hur-
ricanes and Yankees — including Alex Ro-driguez.
  The Yankees’ third baseman nearly en-
rolled at Miami before signing his ﬁ  rst pro deal, has donated millions to his adopted 
university and is a member of the school’s 
board of trustees. Rodriguez regularly works out at Miami during the offseason as well, but has not been part of these talks be-tween the Hurricanes and the Yankees, Ho-cutt said.
