As Gainesville Police continues investigating a serial uri-
nator, three more victims have come forward. The depart-
ment released a composite sketch of the suspect Monday.
A UF Alert sent to students, staff and faculty March 5 re-
ported police are investigating four counts of battery and ex-posure of sexual organs from Feb. 22 through March 1.
A man is suspected of approaching females from behind 
and peeing on them between the 100 and 200 blocks of North-west 17th Street and the 900 block of West University Av-enue.
Victims described him as a 6-foot black male between 25 
and 30 years old with a medium to large build, according to 
the alert. 
He has short curly hair, a dark complexion and was last 
seen wearing a dark hoodie and baggy jeans.
GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias said no one has re-
ported any more recent cases.  
Tobias said students should keep an eye on their sur-
roundings to prevent possible future incidents.
“It’s the same for avoiding anybody,” Tobias said.
Jamie Thomas, a UF English senior, said her friends 
thought the idea of a serial urinator was funny.
But she was more concerned.“It does scare me hearing about all of the crimes that hap-
pen around campus,” the 22-year-old said.

tective Scott Bertzyk at 352-393-7657.

Starke Elementary School re-
sumed operation Tuesday after it 
was closed roughly eight months ago due to rampant mold.
All of the school’s nearly 500 
students have returned from their temporary classrooms in three schools, smoothly transitioning into the last quarter of the school year. The school underwent signiﬁ  cant renovations to rid 
itself of a linger-ing mold prob-lem, which had plagued Starke Elementary since 
its opening 16 
years ago. 
Brian Graham, 
Bradford County 
School District spokesman, said the majority of the school’s $2 million renovation budget went to its state-of-the-art heating, ventilation and air conditioning system that con-trols temperature and humidity for the building.
“Maintaining a safe educational 
environment was our priority,” Gra-
ham said. “Having them here wasn’t 
necessarily a clean and safe learning environment.”
The system brings with it sensors 
for each room that sound an alarm when the humidity reaches unwant-Starke Elementary opens mold-free

Behind closed doors, UF president Bernie 
Machen held a meeting for Levin College of 
Law faculty and staff to address the postponed law dean search.
At the meeting, which the public and press 
were not allowed to attend, Machen solicited input from faculty and staff on the search and his proposal for interim dean.
Lyrissa Lidsky, a member of the dean 
search committee and UF associate dean for international studies at the law college, was one of the more than 60 faculty and staff mem-bers present at the meeting.
Lidsky said it’s a pivotal time in the legal profession to be selecting a new dean.
“It was helpful to have 
the president come and explain the reasons for de-claring a failed search,” she 
said. “As president, he has the broad view of the en-tire university’s needs at 
heart.”
Machen proposed that professor George 
Dawson ﬁ  ll in as interim dean once current dean Bob Jerry vacates his position in June.
Dawson, who has worked at the College 
of Law for about 33 years, plans to delay his retirement to take on the position.  
Dawson said there is a need to fulﬁ  ll the 
role, and he is willing to do it.
“There is an awful lot of work to be done,” 
he said. “I’m looking forward to a fairly chal-lenging job for the next year.”

Tuesday night’s Student Senate 
meeting may have had a late start, 
which resulted in the cancellation of a new Senate member orientation workshop, but that didn’t stop sena-
tors from getting down to business 
once the meeting began.
Beginning at 8:30, the 83 senators 
present approved four resolutions and four committee seats within the ﬁ  rst six minutes of the meeting by unanimous consent.
The resolution, Proposing Revi-
sion to the Rules and Procedures, au-
thored by Michael Christ, increased 
the rounds and minutes of pro-con debate senators may have when dis-cussing candidates for committee positions.
Instead of two rounds of pro-con 
debate, senators will now have three rounds with each round extended to three minutes per side.
“I felt that we needed a little bit 
more time in case there were more senators that ever wanted to speak,” he said. “It’s a good bill and good in building the institution of Senate.”
One of the resolutions that 
passed, Student Bill 2014-1021, sup-ports the Collegiate Housing and In-frastructure Act in the U.S. Congress. 
Senate President Dylan Fisher, who 
co-authored the bill, said that Senate supports the bill because it will have immediate effects on the students at UF.
“All in all, the beautiful thing 
about it is this just makes hous-ing better for students,” he said. “It would directly affect the University of Florida … so this is something that we (Student Government) would support. That’s why we unanimous-ly passed that as far as taking steps for housing safer and creating more opportunities for students at the university.”
Senators also unanimously 
passed a resolution that supported funding for the Generation Sketch Comedy show. The resolution was authored by the allocations commit-tee and will grant the organization $175.
Leah Miller, chair of the alloca-
tions committee, said the organi-zation is “excited to hold another event.” 
The last resolution that passed, 
which supported the Spring-Green-ing Day, was co-sponsored by the Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability and repre-sented the Senate’s support for e-waste recycling.
E-waste recycling is deﬁ  ned as recycling “electronic equipment near or at the end of its useful life,” according to the resolution. It repre-sents more than two percent of the total waste in landﬁ  lls.
Senators chose to unanimously 
approve the four recommendations for committee seats.
Victoria Fernandez was ap-
pointed to the allocations commit-tee, Nadia Kemal was appointed to the budget committee, McLane Ed-wards was appointed to the judicia-ry committee, and Jacquelyn Smith was appointed to the rules and eth-ics committee.

UF law students expressed concerns about the college’s reputation
phen C. O’Connell chairman, said 
Dawson is the best choice for in-terim dean. But he said his job is a difficult one. 
“That position is very challeng-
ing because you really don’t have 
time to carry out any kind of long-
term plan, and people know you will be gone in a few months,” he said. 
Machen said the official deci-
sion for interim dean will be made within the next few days.
UF originally paid a Los Ange-
les firm $90,000 to narrow the pool of candidates. 
Out of the 24 candidates the 
firm suggested, three were re-viewed by Machen and Provost Joe Glover. Final candidates included University of Kentucky College of Law dean David Brennen, Georgia State University College of Law professor Samuel Donaldson and former U.S. ambassador David 
Huebner.
During a press conference be-
fore the meeting, Machen said he 
is looking for someone who can help the faculty work through fu-ture issues with the changes in the legal profession.“We want a leader who is go-
ing to help the college maintain its position of leadership in Florida and hopefully in this country,” he said.
Kevin Baker, a 23-year-old first-
year UF law student, said he feels like all the money spent searching for a new dean has been useless.“To me it just comes as one big 
waste,” he said. “We didn’t take the opportunity to move forward and bring in fresh ideas.”
The search failure has students 
concerned about the reputation of the law college, especially after its ranking recently fell. UF’s law college ranked 49th, compared to FSU at 45th, in the U.S. News & 
World Report ranking of 2015’s 
best law schools.
Anthony Kakoyannis, a 22-
year-old first-year UF law student, said the search failure and the drop in ranking portrays a nega-tive image of the college.“It doesn’t make us look so 
good,” he said. “New students are going to think the school can’t get it together.”
With Machen’s retirement in 
the near future, the next president may have to take on the task of finding the new law dean. 
But Machen said postponing 
the search may save the college 
from making the wrong decision 
now.
“In my experience in adminis-
tration, the most important cost to consider is the cost of making the right choice for the college at the right time,” he said.
lAw, from page 1The school got new air conditioning units and traded carpet for tile 
ed levels. 
Along with the new air conditioning sys-
tem, Graham said all of the school’s carpets 
have been replaced with tile, and all fabric items that couldn’t be cleaned were removed 
to ensure mold wouldn’t make a return ap-
pearance. A multitude of cracks and holes in the building where moisture leaked in were also repaired.  He said every book in the library was 
cleaned with peroxide and bleach solutions. Teachers’ and children’s school items were 
also cleaned when they left to their temporary 
classrooms as well as when they returned to Starke.  
Graham attributed the easy move back to 
the months of planning the school had, as op-posed to its abrupt closure, which happened two days into the school year. Bus routes have returned to normal, meaning students don’t 
have to get to their stops 30 minutes earlier than usual to travel the extra miles to their 
temporary classrooms.
“The students seem very happy. They’re 
glad to be back. Staff members are glad to be back,” he said. “Many of them tell me they can feel the difference.”
The renovations mean mold will be an un-
likely sight at Starke, and teachers like Patricia Wainwright are happy to have their classes return to normal.
Wainwright, who teaches first grade and 
has been at Starke since its opening, said she can feel the difference in air quality in her classroom. The mold in her closet and other dark corners of the classroom is gone, and she 
doesn’t have to share a room with another 
teacher anymore. She and her students had to travel seven miles north of Starke to Lawtery Elementary, where her first-grade class joined another for the majority of the school year. 
She said the school previously tried to 
remove the mold, but it always came back. Wainwright called the clean-up something 
“we all knew needed to be done.”

Tuesday kicked off Syrian 
Solidarity Week at UF, a series 
of events to bring attention to the 
ongoing conflict in Syria. 
The four-day event began with 
students hosting an information-
al table session on Turlington 
Plaza. 
Free baked goods were given to the more than 100 attendees 
when they asked questions about Syria, said Rana Al-Nahhas, the historian for the Arabic Cultural 
Association and an organizer of 
the event.
The week will end with a flash 
mob on Thursday on Turlington Plaza, where students will silent-
ly reenact scenes of Syrian suffer-
ing, she said.
The event will feature students sprawled on the ground, some dressed in black to represent members of the regime. Organiz-ers hope to represent “the battle-field we call Syria,” Al-Nahhas said. 
The 19-year-old UF applied 
physiology and kinesiology freshman said the event is impor-tant to students because the issue is a global one.
“It doesn’t matter where 
you’re from,” she said. “If you’re from Syria or Mexico, it’s for the same cause. We’re all human.” Sameer Saboungi, president of 
Arabic Cultural Association and student activist, said the three-year conflict has taken the lives of 
more than 130,000 people. That’s 
more than the population of Gainesville, said the 19-year-old UF international studies sopho-more.
“It’s the worst humanitarian 
tragedy in modern times after Rwanda,” he said.

Coffee lovers can get their 
fix for free today during Free 
Iced Coffee Day at Dunkin’ Do-nuts.
Betsy Beck, a Dunkin’ Do-
nuts field marketing manager, wrote in an email that the pro-motion is in recognition of the start of spring and the inevita-ble heat approaching. 
She said March 19 is Free 
Iced Coffee Day around Florida every year.
Sixteen-ounce iced coffees 
are available in the original or dark roast blend and eight dif-ferent flavors: French vanilla, 
hazelnut, toasted almond, blue-
berry, coconut, cinnamon, cara-mel and raspberry.
Daniel Clark, a 24-year-old 
UF food science and human nutrition student, has partici-
pated in the free coffee day pre-
viously.
Clark said he has a strategy 
to bounce from location to loca-tion to take full advantage of the deal.
“I’ll definitely need it be-
cause Wednesdays are my long days,” he said. “I’ll need the 
pick-me-up.”
In addition to the Dunkin’ 
Donuts next to Gator City on 
West University Avenue, the franchise opened a second res-taurant last year just down the 
road in the building with Tar-
get Copy and Firehouse Subs.  Both will be participating in the promotion, as well as the seven other Gainesville locations.Dunkin’ Donuts gives

As the second most volunteer-
producing school for the Peace 
Corps, UF will host a representative on campus.
The events today will include of-
fice hours from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and an open information session from 4 to 5:30 p.m., both in the Large Con-ference Room of the Hub’s Interna-tional Center.
On Thursday, the Peace Corps will host an information table at the College of Journalism and Com-munications’ Interviewing Day, followed by a panel discussion in the Career Resource Center Library from 5:10 to 6:45 p.m.
Chad Chernet, central and north 
Florida regional recruiter for the Peace Corps, will represent the Peace Corps at these events. A UF and Peace Corps volunteer alumnus, Chernet said he has always enjoyed recruiting at UF because he finds the majority of interested students pos-sess the necessary skills.
“They come with experience and 
background, with service learning, community service and volunteer-ism,” he said.
Alex Meckley, a 22-year-old UF 
family, youth and community sci-ences senior, recently received her nomination for the Peace Corps.
“Being a part of the Peace Corps 
interested me because I will have the chance to make a difference by learning from others in a culture completely different from my own,” she said.
Amid controversy in 2012, UF 
canceled its on-campus Peace Corps recruiter due to budget and contract conflicts, according to Alligator ar-
chives.

Gainesville Regional Airport opened its 
new entrance road Tuesday as one of the first 
steps in an airport-area expansion process. 
In a ribbon-cutting ceremony, the airport 
celebrated the opening of Major General John 
R. Alison Avenue, a $2.4 million access road 
that connects the commercial terminal loop to Waldo Road.    The road was construct-
ed using state and federal grants and was named af-ter the well-known, highly 
decorated World War II 
airman and UF alumnus Alison.   
The construction of the 
road has been in the works 
for more than a decade and was part of the airport’s second phase of development, said GRA spokeswoman Laura Aguiar. The first phase of the plan designated 40 acres between the airport runway and the Alachua County Fairgrounds to serve as land for future devel-opment. 
“It’s an economic development project,” 
Aguiar said.  
Restaurants, hotels and a pet boarding cen-
ter are examples of businesses the airport is hoping to attract, Aguiar said. 
Frequent flyers should be aware the exit 
from the new road crosses over the car rental return area, which could cause confusion to customers driving to their terminal, she said.
Hannah Lutz, a 20-year-old UF nursing sophomore, said she uses the airport to and from Miami.  
Lutz said she thinks the access road and 
airport-area expansion could make traveling 
more convenient.
Aguiar said that road has the potential to 
affect students like Lutz and members of the 
Gainesville community in a positive way. Ex-pansion promises jobs and opportunities for students to look for new employers and in-ternship opportunities, Aguiar said.
“As Gainesville grows, the airport grows,” 
she said. Gainesville airport opens new access road to help travelers

the alleged victim said she drank heavily at the 2012 party and doesn’t remember much of what happened that night. Tate faces charges of aggravated sexual assault and lying to in-vestigators in a trial that turns on whether the 
woman was too drunk to consent to sex. 
The closely watched court-martial comes at 
a time when the military is under scrutiny to 
curb sexual assaults in the Armed Forces.
During opening statements, prosecutor Lt. 
Cmdr. Ryan Stormer described the woman as drinking “shot after shot after shot” and tak-ing “swig and swig and swig” from a bottle of alcohol. Stormer said the woman eventually became so drunk that she blacked out, walk-ing and talking but not remembering what 
was going on.
One of Tate’s attorneys, meanwhile, ar-
gued the woman was able to make her own 
decisions, including those about sex. Cmdr. Art Record described the woman as “upright, walking around,” having conversations and even rebuffing the advances of one man.The woman testified that after the party she 
saw tweets suggesting someone had sex with multiple people at the party. She said she came to believe the statements were about her. Tate 
confirmed they had sex, the woman said.
As Tate’s case unfolded, an Army general 
faced sentencing in North Carolina in another 
high-profile sexual assault case. Brig. Gen. Jef-frey Sinclair pleaded guilty to having improp-er relationships with three subordinates, but charges of sexual assault were dropped.

BurgerFi, a new restaurant 
in a chain with a national 
following, had lines out the door for its grand opening in Butler Plaza last weekend.
The restaurant, located 
at 3518 SW Archer Road, is the 42nd to open around the country, said Meha Bashi, BurgerFi marketing man-ager. 
Bashi said one of the rea-
sons the burger joint attracts a lot of people is because it is 
a greener alternative.
“The meat is all-natural, 
free-range beef,” she said. 
“It’s never frozen. There is never any additives or chem-icals or hormones.”
Amara Harnish, a 21-year-
old UF English junior and BurgerFi employee, said 
the opening day was “awe-
some and intense at the same time.”
She said the lines were 
consistently wrapped around the building throughout the day, and every table was taken.
Harnish said she thinks 
BurgerFi’s popularity can be attributed to the fact that everything is made fresh to order, from the burgers to the other menu items like hot dogs and sides.
The BurgerFi burger and 
cheeseburger cost about $7. Other burgers, like the brisket burger and veggie burger, range from about $4 
to $10. The restaurant also of-
fers hot dogs that cost rough-ly between $3.50 to $5. Fries cost between $2.77 to $5.77 depending on size. Custom-ers order items a la carte, so there’s no combo price.  
Robert Mossorofo, a 
19-year-old UF marketing sophomore, said he enjoys eating at the restaurant be-cause it tastes healthy.
Mossorofo said he attend-
ed the private grand opening Friday through a promotion-al voucher.
He said he loves going to 
the location back home in Fort Lauderdale, and he was 
excited that one opened in 
Butler Plaza.
“I think they’re definitely 
bringing quality food and great options to a town that really a bunch of fast food restaurants,” he said. 
Kristin Mamula, market-
ing associate for Butler Enter-prises, wrote in an email that BurgerFi sets itself apart from other burger restaurants with its high standard of all natu-ral food items.
“Our customers want and 
deserve the best in quality,  and we believe BurgerFi can withhold that high standard,” she said. “They are a great addition to our Restaurant 
Row along Archer Road.”Butler Plaza adds

LED fountain idea 
perfect for Reitz
Students have seen some pretty questionable art come 
and go on UF’s campus in recent years — most notably the monstrous, ugly Plaza of the Americas couple-danc-
ing sculpture/gloriﬁ  ed Krishna-lunch bench. We get that art serves several purposes, but come on, those creepy life-like 
statues of people around campus that were recently removed 
served no other purpose than to scare freshman walking home from Gator Corner Dining Center late at night. 
We reported Tuesday that a UF student proposed an art 
installation that would actually serve a purpose. Clint Fer-guson, a 20-year-old UF business management sophomore, envisions a hydrotechnic fountain system installed in the Reitz Union fountain. The Reitz fountain, a popular student hangout spot on nice days, would be the perfect location for 
a Disney-inspired hydrotechnic fountain display, he argued. 
He’s been making serious moves in achieving his goal, 
too. He got a quote from Disney Adventure Park in Califor-
nia, has proposed the idea to the Reitz Union Board and re-cruited the help of Gator Robotics to build the display, which would shoot colored water into the air in sync with music.
“By day, the pond would have a peaceful, pulsing foun-
tain to give you something to drown out the cars and buses,” he told the Alligator. “By night, there would be 30-minute, 
fully choreographed water shows with lasers and lights, all 
set to music.”
If that doesn’t sound hella dope, we don’t know what 
does. 
It’s a good idea, and UF students have the chops to make 
it a reality. After all, UF’s Society of Automotive Engineers manufacture a small-scale Formula One car every year, rely-ing completely on the labor and craft of UF students. It seems plausible, then, that students could produce a hydrotechnic 
fountain display. 
The project certainly aligns with UF’s mission to “educate 
students so they are prepared to make signiﬁ  cant contribu-
tions within an increasingly global community.” Obviously, it’s the dream of all students to leave a lasting mark on the place they’ve spent years developing their personalities and honing their skills in whichever ﬁ  elds they choose. Although this dream may seem like a novelty on the surface, it repre-sents an opportunity to engage a variety of students on cam-
pus and create something that no other university has. 
The Reitz Union Board and other campus organizations 
will encourage the endeavor through funding, labor, Stu-
dent Government legislation and whatever else is needed to make the idea a reality. Ferguson told the Alligator he needs students’ help on ﬁ  ve different components of the display’s infrastructure: lighting, hydraulics, electronics, software and sound. We think UF students are up to the task. 
Besides, the Reitz fountain is a high-trafﬁ  c area for visit-
ing families and alumni. What better way to illustrate their tuition and donation dollars at work than by displaying the results of an awesome student project?Funding bill shows need for reform
As of last week, the total amount of campaign spending for the 2014 midterm election cycle was more than 25 times greater than it was at the same point in 2006.
Much of this increased spending is the result of the in-
troduction of so-called “dark money” to the election system. 
These funds, which primarily come from conservative bil-
lionaires like the Koch brothers, help ﬁ  nance the political campaigns of right-wing ideologues who share an extreme, nihilistic vision of the role of government in our society.
Under the current American system of campaign ﬁ  nance, 
those who have the most money — corporations and the wealthy — are those who receive the most attention and fa-vorable treatment from our elected ofﬁ  cials.
The large amount of money our politicians raise gives 
them an advantage over any prospective challengers, wheth-er in primary or general elections. OpenSecrets, an organi-zation that tracks campaign spending, estimates that the candidate who raises the most money in any House of Rep-resentatives election wins 93 percent of the time.
Now leaders in Congress are seeking to dismantle one of 
the few remnants of a once-robust system of public election funding. Last week, the Senate unanimously approved a bill passed by the House that would eliminate public ﬁ  nancing 
of political party conventions.
At ﬁ  rst glance, the bill seems to be an improvement on our 
existing system. After all, why should taxpayers foot the bill 
for lavish and increasingly expensive party conventions?
However, this bill is not about saving taxpayer money or 
increasing government efﬁ  ciency. Eliminating public ﬁ  nanc-ing of party conventions simply provides another opportu-nity for elected ofﬁ  cials to solicit contributions from corpora-tions and the wealthy.
The trend of corporate funding of party conventions has 
already begun. In 2012, both the Republican and Democratic parties accepted tens of millions of dollars in corporate do-nations for their conventions. These donations essentially amount to what former President Jimmy Carter referred to as a system of “legal bribery.” Corporations and the wealthy make campaign contributions to politicians around the country, and in exchange, they beneﬁ  t from government pol-icy that favors their interests over those of ordinary Americans. 
This bill moves our system of 
campaign ﬁ  nance in the wrong direction. Rather than seeking to 
eliminate public funding of elec-
tions, our society needs to shift to-ward elections that are completely taxpayer-ﬁ  nanced.
A handful of billionaires and 
massive corporations should not be able to dictate govern-ment policies that affect the well-being of the American peo-ple. Such a system runs contrary to our country’s founding principles of democracy, political equality and a government 
that effectively represents the interests of its citizens.
Because the Supreme Court has ruled that most limits 
on political spending are unconstitutional, any signiﬁ  cant 
reform of our campaign ﬁ  nance system will require a consti-tutional amendment. Such an amendment would explicitly state that corporations are not people and have no inherent right to participate in the political process. The amendment ideally would include restrictions on campaign spending and require Congress to establish a robust system of public 
campaign ﬁ  nance.
Unfortunately, members of Congress are not likely to vol-
untarily restrict their abilities to collect massive amounts of 
money for use in their re-election campaigns. 
However, the Constitution provides a path for passing 
amendments that does not require the involvement of Con-gress at all. A constitutional convention can be held if two-thirds of all state legislatures request it. 
Several organizations are working to build support 
among state legislators for an amendment to reform our bro-ken election system. 
Until reforms are implemented, our elected ofﬁ  cials and 
our system of government will consistently and systemically favor the interests of corporations and the wealthy over or-dinary Americans.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry made waves last 
week during an appearance on ABC’s late-night talk show “Jimmy Kimmel Live.” 
Kimmel and Perry discussed the 2016 presi-
dential election, guns and the governor’s sur-
prising musical abilities. But one point Perry 
made that night really stood out, and though it did not get as loud an applause as when Perry said he might consider legalizing marijuana in Texas, it was an important point nonetheless.
Perry discussed reforming the Texas legal system and 
criticized the inefﬁ  ciencies of its handling of petty crime and minor drug offenses. 
“We’ve been able to shut down a prison in the state of 
Texas,” he said. “That’s conservative, man!” 
This is a topic Americans do not talk about enough. We 
have a penitentiary system in place that is not only bloated but also broken. Success in the penal system is improperly gauged by number of incarcerations instead of the number of released inmates not returning to conﬁ  nement. 
Perry continued and said, “You don’t want to ruin a kid’s 
life for having a joint.” 
A young person’s life could be shattered beyond repair 
just by committing one minor crime when he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Such is a direct consequence of unsuccessful drug policies and an ineffective penal sys-tem.  
More tragically, the system treats certain groups of people 
differently than others. A teenager who killed four people while driving under the inﬂ  uence a few months ago did not serve jail time due to “afﬂ  uenza” — the result of being too wealthy and privileged for punishment.  Yet a kid in the in-
ner city caught with a joint in his back pocket will have an en-
tirely different sentencing just because he was born of differ-ent circumstances. This glaring double standard is perfectly clear and completely unjust.  
Perry has the right idea. Closing down even one prison, 
especially in a state like Texas, signals a growing demand for change in our handling of crime. 
And such a demand is, in fact, conservative. Conservatives believe in ceding power from the state and 
giving it back to the individual. Because a prison is state pow-er incarnate, pursuing reform of the penal system should be encouraged by the principled right. Conservatives, in addi-tion to this, believe in a certain submission to reality. And the reality is the system fails for too many people and negatively affects too many lives. 
This demand for change impacts not only future Ameri-cans, but all Americans wrongfully denied a second chance at life because of a single non-violent crime. And when a second chance is so wrongfully denied, released inmates are more likely to make the same mistakes and end up in 
the same punitive state they were just released 
from.        
Other legislators have taken this demand to 
heart. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., has publicly ex-pressed frustration with the system, stating that 
federal mandatory minimum sentences are a “major culprit in our unbalanced and often unjust drug laws.” These rigid rules prevent judges from handing out more lenient prison sentences to ﬁ  rst-time offenders.  Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, in 
bipartisan fashion, is shepherding pieces of reform legisla-
tion in the Senate. 
Paul, Lee and Perry — three of the most prominent Re-
publicans in the country — are offering a fresh perspective to the conservative movement that for decades has been the defender of rules, harsh sentencing and an aggressive war on crime.
The right has not been shy about expressing its views on 
crime. Richard Nixon’s Law and Order campaign contrib-
uted to his victory in two presidential elections. President 
Ronald Reagan intensiﬁ  ed the war on drugs. Then-Vice Pres-ident George H. W. Bush hit Gov. Michael Dukakis, D-Mass., in the 1988 election for being too soft on criminals and op-posing capital punishment. Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani solidiﬁ  ed this right-leaning belief when he forcefully took back the city from the unlawful.
Riots, organized crime rings, assassinations and rampant 
acts of violence plagued the country during that time. One 
can make the argument that such measures were needed 
back then. But the results of these actions have led to an in-crease in state power, something conservatives do not want to admit. 
There is an opportunity for change because we live in a 
different world. People’s views on drugs, crime and the sys-tem have changed. Many people have seen the harm the sys-tem does; think of all the separated families, the children with parents in prison and the job opportunities denied due to the 
lack of reform. And while this might not be the most high-
proﬁ  le issue in the political arena, there is a possibility that something good can come out of this demand for change.    
We must champion reform, not because it is just a conser-
vative thing to do, but because it is the right thing to do.

For some, a hotel is a symbol of a comfort. To others 
it’s a foothold in a faraway place, allowing them to go where they have never gone before. For Wes 
Anderson, it is a colorful backdrop for love, war, mys-tery and murder.
Although “The Grand Bu-
dapest Hotel” is exactly what fans of Anderson have come to love and expect stylistically, it is arguably a darker chapter in the everlasting storybook of quirky misadventures, out-of-place characters and all the other oddities that com-prise the Wes Anderson empire. His new ﬁ  lm expands into new territory with a rather grim storyline and a pen-
chant for the macabre.
Anderson takes his meta-narrative framework to an 
entirely new depth this time, presenting a story within a 
story, as told by separate narrators. Eventually we ﬁ  nd ourselves at the door of the Grand Budapest Hotel, a magniﬁ  cent chateau atop a mountain in pre-World War II Europe. The hotel’s prestigious reputation is the effect of one man: Monsieur Gustav (a brilliant and charismat-ic Ralph Fiennes).
While he lives and dies by the rules of good hotel ser-
vice, he is not above tending to the extra needs of sev-eral of the hotel’s elderly female guests, especially when they’re rich. All trademark Anderson hipster-hell breaks loose when one of Gustav’s wealthiest lovers, Madame D. (Tilda Swinton, in more prosthetic make-up than Benjamin Button), is murdered after making him heir to the priceless portrait, “Boy with Apple.” The criminal relatives of Madame D. (led by a gothic Adrian Brody) 
set Gustav up as the murderer, spurring a cross-country 
game of cat and mouse between them and the European army commander Henckels (Edward Norton, more or less revitalizing his clueless-man-in-uniform character from “Moonrise Kingdom”).
At Gustav’s side is the faithful Zero, the lobby boy 
(newcomer Tony Revolori) who is his apprentice and young conﬁ  dant. Placing the budding friendship be-tween the duo at the heart of the ﬁ  lm, Anderson slightly undercuts some of the more shocking and morbid sub-ject matter. “Budapest” marks a deﬁ  nite departure in tone in comparison to his other ﬁ  lms. People are poi-soned, shot and strangled in this story, all during the days leading to an occupation of a vague fascist military force (an obvious send-up of the Nazi party). The humor 
in the ﬁ  lm is also a bit more adult than what’s normal for 
Anderson, especially in regard to the details of Gustav’s sexual escapades with the hotel’s older women.
Despite this bleaker variant of Anderson’s typical 
whimsy, he still weaves in many of the heartfelt themes his stories are known for. Zero forms a pure and im-practical romance with the apprentice of a local baker (Saoirse Ronan), and the two quickly decide to marry. Their unabashed love and naiveté is reminiscent of the 
star-crossed protagonists in “Moonrise Kingdom” but 
is paired with a more realistic ending here. Also, the father-son relationship that blossoms between Zero and Gustav is typical of other Anderson ﬁ  lms, like “Rush-more” and “The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou.”
For viewers who are new to Anderson’s work, the 
ﬁ  lm’s cast is tempting enough. To name them all would take too long and would ruin half of the fun of seeing familiar faces pop up in not-so-familiar wardrobes. In addition to the actors already mentioned, standouts in the ﬁ  lm include Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel and a vi-cious Willem Dafoe.
All in all, Anderson seems to have topped himself 
with “Budapest.” Its innovative narrative, classic en-semble of characters and grandiose set pieces all indicate that he’s achieved a tighter grasp on his own aesthetic. Say what you may about his marginal style, but there is no doubt that he is one of the few directors working today who consistently produces content that is daring and at all times unique.

Schools across the state have tran-
sitioned the focus of their cur-ricula to FCAT topics. I do not 
fault schools, given the ramiﬁ  cations of test scores on public perception and 
teachers’ evaluations; see Senate Bill 
736. I do, however, question the qual-ity of the assessments. 
These concerns originate from my 
time as a mathematics educator and assessment specialist for Educational Testing Service, where I worked on the development of the SAT, GRE and AP Statistics. My concerns are intensi-ﬁ  ed by the inﬂ  uence assessments have on what children believe it means to 
do mathematics.
Educators do not object to having 
student achievement measured. A 
misalignment between what FCAT measures and what is valued math-ematically creates a dysfunctional culture with the dilemma of “teach-ing for understanding” versus “teach-ing to the test.” Proponents of FCAT 
would argue educators should not 
“teach to the test,” but the nature of the questions says otherwise.
There are several examples from 
the Florida Department of Education website to highlight my concerns. The examples that motivated this piece are from third-, fourth- and ﬁ  fth-grade math.
Analysis of all FCAT sample ques-
tions revealed that 20 percent of ques-
tions ask students to match equations 
to problem contexts. This method of assessment discourages creative problem solving and forces students to think as the person who created the test. There are also questions that intentionally try to trick students by presenting tables that change se-quencing in the middle of a table. This is bad practice in both assessment and 
statistics. Other example questions re-
quire students to catch subtle things in the text (e.g., “to and from work” and “round trip”) or else they will be led into selecting the wrong option. Students may successfully navigate the mathematics in the problem but end up getting the wrong answer for 
reasons related to reading. One could 
argue they should just read the ques-tion carefully. Is it then still a test of mathematics?
Education is the one ﬁ  eld many 
think they are experts at because they were once students. Anyone who be-lieves being a classroom teacher is easy because of June, July and August should spend one week being held re-sponsible for educating all students.
How would you feel being evalu-
ated in your profession the same way teachers are evaluated? How would you feel if your evaluations were made public? Imagine the scrutiny we subject our teachers to, and then imagine receiving the same salary as a teacher. 
Please take the time to thank teach-
ers for all they do because the system does not make it easy for them to 
succeed. It’s time we change how we 
evaluate education and begin to ap-preciate our teachers for all they do.
If this article moves you, please 
contact Commissioner Pam Stewart  at Commissioner@ﬂ  doe.org and Gov. Rick Scott at ﬂ  gov.com/contact-gov-scott/email-the-governor. 
A question you may want to ask 
is, “What assessment and learning experts from our universities were involved in the $220 million decision to have AIR develop the state’s assess-ments?”

Nonprofit organization WellFlorida will be aid-
ing students in the final stretch to sign up for health 
care.
The organization’s website, ncfnavigators.org, al-
lows users to reach out to trained workers — called 
navigators — for help. The program was started in 
response to the Affordable Care Act, which requires every citizen to be insured by March 31.
Under the act, young adults can stay under their 
parents’ insurance plans until the age of 26. 
Students have been a focus for these groups be-
cause they tend to fall into the gap between qualify-ing for Medicaid and being able to afford private in-surance, said Jasmine Burney, a navigator for health 
advocacy organization Florida Chain.
“I think that it’s great that students stay on par-
ents’ health insurance,” she said. “They don’t have 
to do the necessary steps to have to get health insur-ance.”
Belosmeli Leon, a UF second-year graduate stu-
dent of public health and intern at WellFlorida, said students are important targets because they often fall behind.
“I think it’s really important to showcase this to 
other students ‘cause a lot of times they are the last ones to find out about these things or they think they are invincible,” she said.
Allyson Hall, a UF health services research, man-
agement and policy associate professor, said there has traditionally been pushback against public health care legislation. 
“I think it was remarkable anything was passed 
at all,” she said. 
Lauren Vagelakos, WellFlorida project coordi-
nator, said the organization is a good opportunity 
for students to take advantage of the legislation and 
avoid the “young invincibles” mentality.
“Young invincibles” refers to young adults who 
feel they do not need to enroll for insurance, she said.
When students get into this mindset, they miss 
great opportunities, Vagelakos said. 
“When you’re young, you think you can’t get 
hurt or you won’t get sick,” she said. “And some-
times that’s not the case.”Group pushes

UF athletes are jumping for Martin 
Matak’s startup.
Matak, a UF alumnus, created a 
vertical-jump measuring device that 
tells athletes the height and number of 
their leaps. Vert is a small clip-on that 
wirelessly connects to a smartphone application.
The idea came to Matak when he 
was coaching a fifth-grade basketball team right after graduating college.“There was one practice we had 
where all the kids cared about was how high they could jump,” Matak said.  “I remember thinking to myself, ‘There’s got to be a way to electronically mea-sure how high someone can jump.’”
Matak’s device is now used and sold 
across the country. 
For the UF women’s volleyball team, 
the device has been a game-changer, head coach Mary Wise said.“With the use of Vert, we get objec-
tive feedback,” she said. “We can see the amount of jumps each player is tak-ing, and we can see when fatigue comes in.”
Vert can also be used to show fans 
how high a player’s jump is in real time, Matak said. Their jump count and height can be displayed on the big screen throughout the game.
Melissa Flanjack, a 20-year-old UF 
public relations junior, said it would be exciting to incorporate into other sports such as basketball.
“I totally want to know how high 
Pat Young is jumping when he dunks the ball,” she said. “That would be so cool to have at Gator games.”UF alumnus creates app athletes leap for

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
KIEV, Ukraine — Ukraine’s lead-
ership simmered with a mix of hope-
lessness and anger at losing Crimea, tempering an influx of eager young men signing up as reservists with 
the growing certainty that no savior 
would deliver them from the Rus-sian takeover.
For Ukraine’s government in 
Kiev, it is a crime — one the inex-perienced leaders can do little to ad-dress in the face of an overwhelm-ingly superior military force. But for at least one of the group of people 
in the new leadership, it is a reality 
that must be dealt with on practical terms.
“This is theft on an internation-
al scale, when under the cover of troops, one country has just come and robbed a part of an independent state,” Ukraine’s Prime Minister Ar-seniy Yatsenyuk said.
Yatsenyuk’s 
government now 
has to contend with the immedi-ate complications of an armed con-frontation that flared up Tues-day. A Ukrainian military spokes-
man said a serviceman was killed and another injured when a military facility in Crimea was stormed by armed men. The official said a truck bearing a Russian flag was used in the operation.
Yatsenyuk said the storming 
showed the dispute “has gone from the political stage to the military through the fault of the Russians.”
But if his rhetoric was combative, 
there was little to back it up. That is in part down to Ukraine’s relative 
helplessness and its stated desire to 
refrain from aggression, but is also a reflection of what authorities see as Moscow’s inflated demands. Re-jecting international condemnation, Russian President Vladimir Putin cast his government’s actions as the righting of historic injustices.
“They are demanding to change 
the constitution, to change the sys-tem, to give up Crimea. This is the language of an aggressor ... this is the language of Josef Stalin,” said Oleksiy Haran, a politics professor at the University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy. “Ukraine has done every-thing which it can. We resisted from violence, which again the West de-manded from us. We didn’t kill any Russian soldiers.”
While not recognizing the ref-
erendum, Ukrainian authorities’ 
preparations for the practicalities of 
the situation hint at resignation. The justice minister offered emergency accommodation in vacation centers for any Ukrainian citizens who want to leave Crimea, where the ethnic Russian population is a majority.
“My advice to compatriots who 
live in Crimea is not to give up your 
Ukrainian passports. You are citi-
zens of Ukraine and you are in effect hostages of the occupiers,” Justice Minister Pavel Petrenko told Chan-nel 5 television.
Ukraine’s one major lever of 
power — the electricity and water that comes from the mainland — is complicated by the new Kiev gov-ernment’s reluctance to alienate the residents, a majority of whom are ethnic Russians, but with large Ukrainian and Tatar communities.
The government is confronting a 
growing clamor in eastern Ukraine, another heavily Russian-speaking part of the country, for secession or greater federalization. The claims of the ethnic Russian population ig-nited soon after the parliament that took center stage after last month’s ouster of President Viktor Yanuk-
ovych provoked outrage — from the 
Kremlin most notably — by moving to downgrade the role of the Rus-sian language.
That plan has since been dropped 
and Yatsenyuk on Tuesday insisted that Russia would retain its official status in areas where it is spoken by the majority.

Cases of what is being called “super gonorrhea” 
are on the rise across the country
A recent study from the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention published in the April 2014 issue 
of Emerging Infectious Diseases, stated that this strand of the sexually transmitted disease resists treatments 
and has been found in major U.S. cities.  
The new strain of gonorrhea has the same effects 
as treatable gonorrhea, said Samantha Evans, a health 
promotion specialist at GatorWell Health Promotion Specialists. The danger is the long-term effects the dis-
ease has on the body when left untreated.
Resistant strains of the disease ﬁ  rst appeared in 
Hawaii and California and have since spread across 
the country, according to the study. 
The disease could potentially become resistant to 
treatment because people with gonorrhea stop taking 
prescribed treatments before the disease is fully out of 
the body, strengthening it against future medication instead of eliminating it, Evans said. 
“People just don’t take the medications for as long 
as they’re supposed to,” Evans said.She added that the best way for students to protect 
themselves from this type of disease is to practice safe sex by using condoms, getting tested regularly and 
communicating with their partners.
Phylis Craig, associate director of nursing at UF, 
said she had similar views. Craig, who works in the 
women’s clinic at the Student Health Care Center, said completing all prescribed medications is crucial when 
being treated for sexually transmitted diseases.
“I don’t claim to be a biologist, but gonorrhea seems 
to be a pretty clever bacteria,” she wrote in an email. 
“It has morphed better than some of the other bacteria to become resistant.”
Craig said she stresses the use of condoms to protect 
students from not only gonorrhea but also unwanted 
pregnancies and other common sexually transmitted 
diseases such as chlamydia and HIV.
Charisse Ahmed, a 21-year-old UF health educa-
tion and behavior major, said she was shocked by the discovery and spread of “super gonorrhea” in the 
U.S.
“It is shocking and disappointing to have another 
(STD) issue,” she said. “It’s becoming more dangerous 
to have unprotected sex.”
Ahmed said she is an advocate for safe sex and 
spreading awareness about the risks of unprotected 
sex.
“Get tested,” she said.Super gonorrhea spreading 
across US can’t be treated by 
current drugs, CDC reportsLIFESTYLE
PURVI PANDIT 
Alligator Contributing Writer
Puppy Palooza cautioned students Tuesday 
to think twice before ﬁ  nding a furry friend. 
Off Campus Life, part of the Division of 
Student Affairs at UF, held its third Puppy Pa-
looza at Peabody Hall to assist students who 
are considering adopting pets. 
Nora Kilroy, director of Off Campus Life, 
said she hoped students would come to the Palooza to relieve stress, to learn about pet 
ownership and to hopefully volunteer for adoption agencies in the future.
“Alachua County Humane Society has never done this before,” Kilroy said. “So this is going to be a new experience for them.”
Chrissy Sedgley, adoption and foster coor-
dinator at the Alachua County Humane So-ciety, brought two mixed-breed pit bulls and three gray kittens: Quil, Quip and Quinton. 
“Probably our biggest hope is to recruit 
volunteers, recruit fosters or even (increase) adoptions,” Sedgley said.
She said as the humane society’s network 
of foster homes grows, it prevents the ACHS from euthanizing as many animals that are kept there. 
“We can’t save animals without the help of 
the community,” she said.
Trenton Davis, a 21-year-old UF materials 
science and engineering junior, said he heard 
about the event through Facebook and went to 
play with the puppies.
“I want a pet, but I probably won’t get one 
until I know I can take care of one,” Davis said.Group advises would-be pet owners to look past the ‘aww’ factor

Tuesday night, Josh Tobias watched his 
third-inning solo home run sail into the 
filled left-field bleachers longer than he normally would.
He had good reason. His first home run 
since May 11, 2013, gave Florida (14-7, 2-1 
Southeastern Conference) a one-run lead 
against No. 2 Florida State (17-3, 5-1 Atlan-
tic Coast Conference).
His defensive play in the top-half of the 
inning kept the Seminoles off the score-board after loading the bases with no outs. Tobias, hampered by a torn foot ligament 
in 2013, impacted Florida’s 3-1 win against 
Florida State (17-3) at McKethan Stadium in 
more ways than one.
“It felt really good,” Tobias said. “I saw 
a good pitch to see and I just put the barrel on it. I wasn’t trying to do too much.”
That play ending the Seminoles’ rally in 
the third inning shows up in the box score 
as a 5-3 putout to strand three runners, but it wasn’t just the typical ground out. Tobi-as, playing a deep third base, moved to his right to snag John Nogowski’s ground ball, tried stepping on the bag before firing a throw across the diamond to first baseman 
Braden Mattson.
“I was going to try and tag the base at 
third, but I slipped,” Tobias said. “I knew 
Nogowski wasn’t very fast, so I was like, ‘I got a chance to throw him out,’ and I did.”
Florida starter Danny Young allowed 
two singles and gave up a walk to load the bases for Florida State’s three through 
five hitters — D.J. Stewart, Brett Knief and  
Nogowski. Tobias called it a sticky situa-tion. Young thought otherwise.
He knew the Florida State lineup after 
tossing four relief innings against the in-state rival in Jacksonville last year. He found out Monday from coach Kevin O’Sullivan that he would be starting. A logical choice given the sophomore didn’t see any action in the Gators’ series against Arkansas last weekend.
“I just got to make a pitch. Stewart was 
up and I got him to fly out, thank God,” Young said.
Young struck Knief out looking with an 
inside fastball before inducing Nogowski to ground out to third.
Brizuela tied the game in the sixth on a solo home run off reliever Aaron Rhodes that hit the right-field scoreboard. Florida responded in the bottom half with a RBI tri-ple by Harrison Bader down the right-field

1-0 lead against Central Connecticut 
State in the bottom of the fourth and two outs, Taylore Fuller stepped up to the plate.
Practicing her swing to DJ Snake

Facing a 3-1 count, Fuller did not

From its 26-game winning streak to its 
undefeated Southeastern Conference re-
cord, Florida has knocked down barriers 
and accomplished feats no other team has 
ever done.
But now, the Gators biggest challenge 
comes just 15 feet from the basket.
During the SEC Tournament, Florida 
made just 27 of 54 free-throw attempts, in-cluding its worst performance of the year Sunday when it went 7 of 17 from the char-ity stripe. 
“There’s been numerous games where we come down the stretch of games and gone 10 for 
11, we’ve made 16 out of 
18,” coach Billy Donovan. “There’s been some good stretches. Certainly that 
three-game stretch from 
us was not a great stretch 
for us at all. That would 
be an area we’ve got to get better.”
Against Auburn and Arkansas, two of 
Florida’s tightest games during the regular season, the Gators’ performance at the line was what secured them victory. Free throws challenge Gators

Normally, when your starting pitcher goes only three in-
nings against the No. 2 team in the country, it means your bull-
pen is in for a long night of trying to contain a blowout.
For Florida on Tuesday, it just meant turning the game over to its stellar relief pitchers.
The Gators’ (14-7, 2-1 Southeastern Conference) bullpen 
tossed six innings of solid relief in their 3-1 upset win against the No. 2 Seminoles (17-3, 5-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) on Tuesday night in McKethan Stadium.
“It’s just a tough lineup one through nine,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “But credit our guys for hanging in there and making pitches when they needed to.”
Starting pitcher Danny Young lasted only three innings 
against Florida State even though he didn’t surrender any runs. The sophomore left-hander threw 71 percent of his 58 pitches for strikes but occasionally found too much of the plate — FSU touched him up for six hits. 
“I was alright, just throw a lot of strikes — maybe too 
many,” Young said. “I didn’t get hit too hard, but my pitch count got up there, and Sully came and got me.”
Young didn’t pitch poorly, but his line could have turned 
out much worse if he didn’t escape a bases-loaded, no-out jam in the third inning.
“Just got to make a pitch,” Young said. “It’s tough. You get 
yourself in that trouble, (you) got to find a way to get out of it.”
After Young gave up a leadoff single in the fourth, 
O’Sullivan went to his bullpen, bringing in sophomore Aaron Rhodes.
Rhodes had excelled in long-relief opportunities before 
Tuesday’s game, surrendering only one run in his six previ-ous appearances that lasted two innings or longer. Tuesday was no difference.
The sophomore right-hander gave up one run on a solo 
home run by Jose Brizuela but otherwise was as solid as he had been all season, striking out four of the 12 batters he faced.
Next out of the Gators’ pen was Bobby Poyner. The junior 
left-hander, who was previously UF’s Friday-night starter, has 
excelled since moving to the bullpen, pitching 6.1 scoreless in-
nings in relief. That trend also continued.
Poyner closed out the game with three perfect frames, pre-
venting a single FSU batter from reaching base in the late in-
nings and earning his first save of the season.
“They’re all really good,” O’Sullivan said. “They’ve all 
been really good. I think this is one of those games where ev-
erybody contributed. It wasn’t one guy.”EDEN OTERO

Shannon Gilroy has become the star of 
a team in a sport where toughness beats 
perfection.
If she turns the ball over, she makes 
up for it on the next draw. She leads the 
team with 49 draws in just 11 games. Gil-
roy is the ultimate competitor, and every defense that has gone against Florida this season knows it.
In Tuesday night’s game, Dartmouth (3-
3) played no differently defensively than every other team that has faced Gilroy. It got the same results. 
In No. 4 Florida’s (9-2, 1-0 American La-
crosse Conference) 14-7 win against Dart-mouth on Tuesday, Gilroy led the team 
with six goals.
At No. 3 Syracuse on Saturday, Gilroy 
faced the challenge of being defended by 
two and three of the best defenders in the 
country at once. 
Even against some of the toughest play-
ers in the sport, Gilroy managed three goals, one assist and two caused turn-overs.
Gilroy’s night against Dartmouth was 
much of the same, except, with more scor-ing and more caused turnovers.
With a career-high four caused turn-
overs, six goals and four draw controls, Gilroy supported the Gators when the mo-mentum wasn’t in their favor.
“I had a lot of shots that I didn’t get in, 
but I had my teammates there to back it up and get me the ball,” Gilroy said.
Dartmouth’s defense focused most of 
its energy on the junior, who has been the powerhouse scorer for the Gators this sea-son  with 49 goals.
Coach Amanda O’Leary said Gilroy’s 
mentality is what makes her such an effec-tive player.
“She’s taking on three defenders at 
minimum,” O’Leary said. “She’s just so strong and so smart with the ball. She has incredible shot selection. She is just the whole package.”
Gilroy’s job at midfield against the Big 
Green created momentum that the Gators 
lacked in the first 10 minutes of the game. 
Florida is notorious for its quick offense 
and first-point-on-the-board mentality, 
but Dartmouth took the first goal and held Florida scoreless until the 25-minute mark in the first half. 
It wasn’t until the Northport, N.Y., na-
tive put the third point of the game on the board from a free-position shot that Flori-
da’s offense began to push the momentum 
in their direction.
“We like to start off fast; we do not like 
to have the first goal scored upon us,” O’Leary said.
Gilroy’s six points were three times 
more than the next closest scorer for the Gators. Freshman teammate Mollie Ste-vens came second on the team with two 
points.
“I have to credit Dartmouth,” O’Leary 
said. “This is a very, very good lacrosse 
team. They’re very well coached.”At the end of the night, Gilroy finished 
with more broken career records, made more than five points in her fifth game of the season and came just one draw control shy of sitting at fifth in the single-season top-10 list.Freshman attacker Sammi Burgess said 
Gilroy’s leadership and strength on shots have helped the Gators pick up momen-tum in tough situations.
“Her passion, I think, fuels a lot of us,” 
Burgess said.

 UF coach8-2 at Katie Seashole Pressly Sta-
dium on Tuesday.“I’ve been feeling really good 
in the box,” Fuller said. “We’ve been working really hard on all of our swings and producing is what we aim for the entire season. To be able to score those runs for my team — not so much for myself because I could care less about stats — we’re winning games and that’s all that matters.”
Prior to facing Florida, Mes-
sina boasted a 1.12 ERA and was giving up less than a hit per in-ning. 
But on Tuesday, UF logged 10 
hits against the junior right-hand-er with all of Florida’s starters re-cording a hit. 
“I’m happy with our lineup 
up and down,” coach Tim Walton said. “When you can hit up and down the lineup like that, it’s re-ally important. … We were really, really balanced.”
After two scoreless innings, 
sophomore Kelsey Stewart plated her fourth triple of the season and put Florida on the board with a hit to deep left-center field. 
“I felt like I was seeing the ball 
really well today,” Stewart said. 
With the third-inning hit, the 
Wichita, Kan., native logged her 
31st RBI of the season, surpassing 
her total from last season in less than half of the time.
“She’s it,” Walton said. “As 
she goes, we’re going to go, and it’s really clear to see just how im-portant she is to our team all the way around.”
Florida did not let its momen-
tum slip moving into the fourth frame, plating five runs on four hits, highlighted by Fuller’s fifth home run of the year.“We swung the bat good,” 
Fuller said. “We’ve been work-ing really hard on our swings and trying to get back into rhythm and timing on the pitchers.”
For the first time this season, 
Florida used four different pitch-
ers in the circle. 
Senior Hannah Rogers, start-
ing her 13th game of the season, 
earned the win after pitching 4.1 scoreless innings. Outside of giv-ing up a leadoff walk to start the contest against the Blue Devils, Rogers did not allow a single bat-ter to reach base.
Freshman Delanie Gourley 
and juniors Lauren Haeger and Alyssa Bache provided 2.2 in-nings of relief for Rogers. The trio gave up just four hits and allowed two runs to score while striking out five batters and walking only one.
“We’re just trying to keep 
them sharp, keep them in their competitive flow,” Walton said. “Delanie’s trying to work on a couple of little things. Hannah the same thing. Lauren hasn’t really had that many innings here as of late, but we’re going to need ev-erybody.
“Sometimes we need four in a 
game. Sometimes you need two in a weekend. Sometimes you need four in a weekend, so we’ve got to keep everybody ready to go.”
line and a sacrifice fly by Taylor Gushue. 
The game, played in front of a crowd 
of 5,657, tied the 10th-largest announced 
attendance ever at McKethan. It moved at a brisk pace unusual for this in-state 
matchup where O’Sullivan and Florida 
State coach Mike Martin love using their mound visits. 
Games fly by when the pitching holds 
a team to one or fewer run for the seventh time in a month, and the offense pro-vides the timely hits that have defined this stretch of eight wins in the last nine games.
“We’ve been playing better. I am not 
going to sugarcoat things,” O’Sullivan said. 
“If I don’t think we’re playing better 
I would tell you. If I don’t think the at-bats are getting better I would tell you that too. 
“This past weekend, against a really 
good Arkansas team, I thought our bats 
were getting better. I still believe that. We 
got a long way to go. I think this team is confident. I think they’re having fun right now. Obviously it’s very early in the year, but I do like how we’re playing.”In those two regular-season match-
ups, UF sunk 48 of 62 free throws and 14 
of 18 during each game’s last two min-
utes.
However, when Florida had the 
chance to ice its championship against 
Kentucky on Sunday, neither Scot-
tie Wilbekin nor Dorian Finney-Smith could knock down a free throw.
The Gators’ 41.2 efficiency from the 
line on Sunday, which was the worst 
of the year, was actually lower than the 
team’s three-point shooting percentage against the Wildcats (42.1).
“Honestly I don’t think this was 
our best in terms of handling the close game,” senior Patric Young said.
But it wasn’t just Florida’s struggles 
at the line that let Kentucky back into the game. 
The Gators fouled the Wildcats a sea-
son-high 22 times. And as a result, UK visited the line 26 times, which was the second-highest amount by a Florida op-
ponent this season.
Donovan said he was most frustrated 
by his bench, which committed half of 
the squad’s fouls despite having less time on the court than the starters.
Finney-Smith, the SEC Sixth Man of 
the Year, had four fouls Sunday, fouled out Saturday against Tennessee and committed two more Friday against Missouri.
“It was real frustrating,” the redshirt 
sophomore said after having to leave 
the Tennessee game with just more than 
four minutes on the clock.
But it’s not just Finney-Smith. Dono-
van said the discipline by the bench 
players has not been up to par and it 
showed during the Gators’ run during the conference tournament.“We fouled too much,” Donovan 
said. “Kasey Hill and DeVon Walker fouled way too much in the game. De-Von Walker picks up a foul, Kentucky’s shooting one-and-one, he just fouls the 
guy 40 feet from the basket for no rea-
son. Kasey Hill fouls a guy all the way up the floor, puts himself in harm’s way. Their defensive discipline, their defen-
sive intensity, how hard they compete 
and play, would be an area that continu-ally needs to be raised.”WEDNESDAY, MARCH 19, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

With the season nearing its close, 
Florida (12-3, 4-1 Southeastern Con-
ference) has already tallied the same number of losses as its last two regu-lar seasons combined.
However, four of its nine remain-
ing opponents are ranked in the top 30.  UF still has enough time to validate its position as both the SEC frontrunner and a national title con-tender if it wins out.
But first, the Gators — an unusu-
al combination of untested under-classmen and experienced seniors 
— must prove they can overcome 
their struggles in road matches.
The first loss of the season dis-
played the freshmen’s lack of experi-ence when UF was upset by North-western at the National Indoors on Feb. 8. After the match, coach Roland Thornqvist did not mince words. 
“Northwestern was better than 
us in everything,” he said. “They re-ally took it to us. … It’s a great learn-ing point for us.”
Florida seemed to learn a valu-
able lesson and bounced back with three straight victories. 
The next defeat against Stanford 
on Feb. 23 was attributed to poor initial play on the part of the Gators, made worse by the large, hostile Cardinal crowd.  UF dug itself in a hole early and never gained enough momentum to make a comeback.
“The one thing we needed to talk 
about and address was our initial 
play in singles, because we really 
didn’t do very well,” Thornqvist said. “I feel like we started off very poorly in singles and we were never really able to come back from it.”
The third and most recent defeat 
came Sunday when Florida visited a surging Georgia group coming off its seventh straight win. Both squads 
met with identical overall and con-
ference records.
During the match, the teams 
looked anything but similar. After the 4-2 loss, Thornqvist made it clear who the better team was.
“[Georgia] will be my pick to 
win the national championship,” he said. “The level of play that they dis-
played today in front of their home 
crowd should make them the favor-ite. It was a very, very high level of tennis.”
Each of the Gators’ three losses 
shared one common denominator — a noisy road crowd the team was unable to handle. 
Until they manage to do so, don’t 
count on Thornqvist changing his pick.UF aiming
