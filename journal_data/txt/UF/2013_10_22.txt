The Alachua County Fair 
has opened its gates for another 
round of rides, shows and fried 
food.
The fair, which has been com-
ing to the county for more than 
40 years, opened last weekend 
and runs through Saturday at the 
Alachua County Fairgrounds,  3100 NE 39th Ave. 
Along with tried-and-true fair 
attractions, like carnival rides and funnel cake, the fair is introduc-ing new bands, new food ven-dors, and a new show — “Wild 
About Monkeys” — this year, 
said Miriam White, a fair spokes-woman.
White said new food vendors 
include a smoothie booth and 
a locally grown boiled peanuts 
booth.
Kurtis Lee, a 21-year-old UF 
mathematics senior, said that 
although he enjoyed the “Wild 
About Monkeys” show, he would probably not go next year.
“I only had fun because I was 
with friends,” he said. “The fair 
felt pretty low quality, but the 
price is fair.”
But Vassia Daskalakis, a 19-
year-old UF accounting sopho-more, said she would attend again.
“What I liked most is that it 
was cheap,” she said. “I won two ﬁ  sh in a game, and they had tons of unhealthy food, like fried but-
ter.”
Daily specials include a stu-
dent’s day on Friday, on which 
students with a valid ID or ticket provided by the school will be ad-
mitted free between 2 and 5 p.m.VOLUME 108 ISSUE 44 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2013

It started with chanting through the halls, snowballed into 
a barricade of lounge furniture outside the resident assistant’s door and blew up when a sign stolen from the neighboring 
construction site became an accessory in the hall lounge.
“We try to be the ﬂ  oor that goes down in history,” said Ty-
ler Drescher, an 18-year-old business freshman and Broward East 2 resident. “We did nothing that would hurt anyone, just fun and games.”
But now the party has a chaperone. After a series of she-
nanigans, surveillance cameras appeared on the second ﬂ  oor 
of Broward East hall less than four weeks after classes began 
this semester.
UF Housing spokeswoman Sharon Blansett declined to 
comment on the pranks. She said no group damages have been assessed to any Broward ﬂ  oor this Fall and did not comment Security cameras installed after residents prank Broward Hall

For students whose post-graduate plans 
are pending, a new website is offering Gators 
a venue to market their skills for potential jobs.
Collegefeed.com, a new online social plat-
form, is intended to serve as a personal ca-reer assistant for each student, said Sanjeev Agrawal, the founder and CEO of Colleg-efeed.
Students create proﬁ  les on the Collegefeed 
website to promote their skills, connect with companies and learn how to market their abilities.
The platform has attracted tens of thou-
sands of college students since it was launched nationally about four months ago, 
Agrawal said.
He said he created Collegefeed because college students face a difﬁ  cult situation oth-
er social platforms don’t address.
“Students have a very unique set of needs, 
primarily because they don’t have a lot of work experience and are not exposed to many companies,” Agrawal said.
Students can show academic projects, in-
ternships and work samples on their proﬁ  les 
instead of focusing on job experience.
Collegefeed is intended to bridge the gap between sites like Facebook and LinkedIn.
“It can be very intimidating for students 
to have themselves on the same list as people 
who have been in the business for years,” he said.
Students often have trouble translating 
their academic experience and skills to the real world, Agrawal said.

The School Board of Alachua County has 
launched an online survey to help search for 
someone to replace the outgoing superinten-dent.
The board is using surveymonkey.com to 
allow residents to weigh in on the characteris-tics they hope to see in candidates that will be applying for the position.
The survey, set to remain open until Nov. 
12, features 20 characteristics candidates might possess, ranging from educational expertise to the ability to work in a diverse setting.    The goal is to give the board an understand-
ing of the kind of candidates residents want to see in the position, said Jackie Johnson, Alach-ua County Public Schools spokeswoman.
The replacement search began following 
former superintendent Dan Boyd’s retirement announcement in mid-August.
“He had been working for around 44 years, 
so we anticipated it,” Johnson said. “We knew that it would be sometime this year, and it was just a matter of when.”
Johnson said the number of completed sur-
veys thus far is unclear, but she said she hopes for a good turnout. The school board used the same technology when surveying residents about the board’s strategic planning process and received more than 500 responses, she said.
The board has scheduled three live forums 
to supplement the online survey. The forums are scheduled for 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. on Oct. 29, Nov. 7 and Nov. 12 at Hidden Oak Elemen-tary School, Metcalfe Elementary School and Irby Elementary School respectively.
James Speer, principal of Horizon Center 
Alternative School, said survey responses may vary based on computer literacy of county residents. Residents who have this technology readily available are more likely to respond, 
while those who don’t will hopefully attend 
the forums to provide input, he said.
“Regardless of background, I think people 
want to see someone in that position who is aware and experienced in dealing with the sort of challenges each school in the district is facing,” Speer said.

� TICKET PRICES ARE AS 
LOW AS $1.

Megabus.com, an express 
bus travel company, recently an-
nounced tickets are available for holiday season travel with prices as low as $1 per ticket.
Mike Alvich, vice president of 
marketing and public relations for megabus.com, said he anticipates a 20 percent increase in travelers this winter. 
“Now is when you’ll get the 
lowest fares,” he said. “The popu-lar dates sell out very quickly.”
The bus line travels from 
Gainesville to Atlanta and Orlan-do. 
Megabus.com works from a yield management business model, Alvich said, which means it offers a certain number of seats for a low price, and when those sell out, the prices for seats will rise.
“We have low-price seats all 
the time,” he said. “And as soon as they’re sold out, then the fare auto-
matically goes to the next level.”
Alvich said booking now for fu-
ture dates is wise.
Ishani Jetty, a 20-year-old UF 
microbiology student, said she 
thinks the lowered ticket prices could be a good opportunity for students even though they must book their tickets far in advance of their travel dates.
“I feel like it’s good if you know 
what you’re doing, and you can commit,” she said. “If there’s con-ﬂ  ict, at most you lost a couple of bucks, but I still think it’s a really 
good deal.”Megabus slashes

Horizon Center principalif any other halls had security cameras.
Residents had been taking advantage of 
their newfound college freedom.
The “Eastside Boys,” as the 15 prank-
sters dubbed themselves, tore door tags and 
posters to shreds. The hall fire extinguisher 
became a toy. Stapled thongs and used con-doms embellished hall bulletin boards.
“We all got to know each other really fast 
and became boys,” said Cory Hartstein, an 18-year-old political science freshman. ”It’s kind of dumb, but it’s funny.”
According to residents, their RA had 
enough. 
During the second week of Fall 2013, a 
meeting was called with the residents of Broward East 2, their RA, a UF Housing staff member and two special guests: University Police officers.
UPD spokesman Maj. Brad Barber said 
no criminal incidents have been reported.
To dress for the occasion, residents con-
spired on a floor Facebook group page to turn the meeting into a black-tie affair. Be-fore the meeting, 22 residents dressed up and posed for a picture outside of the dorm.
A week later, the cameras were installed, 
peering down at the entrances of the hall-way.
Residents said no one has received dis-
ciplinary action, but some are required to write essays reflecting on their raucous be-havior.
Marine science freshman Fabio Biondolil-
lo, 18, had to write a two-page, single-space essay for borrowing a lounge couch for a day, a punishment he deemed too long and 
unfair.
Recently, Broward East 2 has mellowed 
out since fraternity recruitment began in Sep-
tember, and residents even befriended their RA. The majority of pranksters are pledges, even though the “Eastside Boys” toyed with the idea of forming their own fraternity.Health science freshman JP Hutchison, 
18, said the floor has yet to see the end of the 
hijinks. He plans on converting the hall into 
a slip-and-slide and a shuffleboard court.
“I see it as more bonding on the floor, 
and I think it brings us together and helps enhance our college experience,” he said. “Obviously we’re bummed, but we’re still gonna find ways to have a good time.”
the UF Career Resource Center, agrees 
with Agrawal and said many students don’t understand how to market them-selves.
She said students searching for jobs 
often focus too much on credentials.
“It’s just as important to have quali-
fications as it is to be yourself,” she said.
But Valcourt does not think UF stu-
dents need a resource like Collegefeed as much as other college students might. Many students already find ca-reer advice through the center.
“We’re a very successful resource 
for career planning and career build-
ing,” she said.
Amanda Marino, a 20-year-old UF 
biology junior, said she thinks Colleg-
efeed is a great idea but doesn’t think she would use it herself.
Marino said she’s more likely to 
find opportunities locally than by go-ing online, but she thinks the site’s con-
venience will likely make it popular.
“It’s useful to have everything all in 
one place,” she said.4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2013

Gainesville Police arrested a Mis-
souri man Sunday night after officers 
alleged he stole cigarettes from several stores and ran from police.
Terry Joe Roberts, 37, was arrested 
on charges of robbery, drug possession and eluding law enforcement officers, according to an arrest report.
At about 9 p.m., Roberts tried to 
buy cigarettes from the Chevron gas station at 3328 W. University Ave.
When the clerk asked for Roberts’ 
ID and put a carton of cigarettes on the counter, Roberts grabbed the carton. 
He struggled with the clerk and twist-
ed her arm before leaving the store with the cigarettes.
He then went to Gator Beverage, 
1126 W. University Ave., and stole a carton of Newport cigarettes the clerk had started to set down on the counter. Roberts “snatched” the carton from the clerk’s hand and left the store with it. 
Earlier that night, Roberts commit-
ted a similar theft at the Gate station at 500 NW 13th Street, and officers reported he may have been driving a silver Dodge Neon, GPD spokesman Ofc. Ben Tobias wrote in an email. 
Based on the three incidents, police 
monitored University Avenue to try to catch Roberts. Roberts drove into Kingswood Court neighborhood.
There, Roberts jumped from his 
moving car, which kept moving and hit another vehicle and caused about $1,000 worth of damage.  
Roberts ran into a wooded area, 
where officers ordered him to stop at gunpoint and arrested him. During a search, officers found a pipe with trac-es of cocaine in his pocket.
Roberts was booked into the Ala-
chua County Jail, where he remained as of press time with a $65,000 bond.Man wrestles cigarettes

Two UF professors were 
inducted into the American 
Academy of Arts and Scienc-es, one of the nation’s oldest and most prestigious societ-
ies and independent research 
centers.
R o b e r t 
Dan Holt, who holds the Arthur R. Marshall, Jr. chair in e c o l o g i c a l 
studies, and 
Michael Ed-ward Mose-ley, distinguished professor of anthropology, attended the induction ceremony ear-lier this month in Cambridge, Mass.
Holt said he was taken by 
surprise when he found out he was nominated in the Spring.
“I was tickled,” he said. “It 
came totally out of the blue. I had no idea this was cooking out there.”
This year’s inductees in-
clude actress Sally Field, film-maker Ken Burns and jazz musician Herbie Hancock, 
according to a news release. 
Inductees  
also includ-ed Nobel and Pulit-zer Prize 
r e c i p i e n t s and Gram-my, Emmy, 
Tony and 
Academy  
Award winners.
“I was very pleased to be 
on the same list as the names of some of the other people who were elected to be fel-lows this year,” Holt said.
Susan deFrance, anthro-pology department chair and wife of Moseley, said she was excited Moseley was chosen to be a part of the Academy.
“This is such a diverse 
group of scholars,” deFrance said. “It’s a nice recognition of a lifetime’s worth of work.”
David Grove, Jerald Milan-
ich and Maxine Margolis of the anthropology department were also inducted into the Academy in previous years, 
deFrance said.
Holt said other famous 
members of the Academy 
who he admired were Charles Darwin, Paul McCartney and the mathematician Leonhard Euler.
“You know, we don’t do 
what we do because we’re try-
ing to get awards and honors 
like this,” Holt said. “It’s won-derful when it happens, but it’s because we think what we do is interesting, we love our disciplines and we think it’s important. We’re delighted when somebody thinks we’ve made a contribution.”

Although the main 26.2-hour event isn’t until April, fund-
raising for the 2014 Dance Marathon at UF has already begun.
The first community event will start at 6 p.m. tonight at Al-
ley Gatorz Bowling Center at 2606 NE Waldo Road.
“We’re having these events to make a difference in the lives 
of the families,” said Jordan Robbins, the community events 
overall chair and 21-year-old UF public relations senior.
Celebrating the 20th year of Dance Marathon, a “‘90s Strikes Back” theme was chosen to coincide with the idea of reminisc-ing. She is expecting about 75 teams. People will be able to dec-orate bowling ball cutouts and pins, which will be donated to 
the UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital, Robbins said.
Another addition is “The Strike is Right Lane,” where a per-
son can donate $1 to compete against a miracle child.Awards include “Team *NSYNC,” which goes to the most 
spirited team, and “Fresh Prince of Bowl-Air,” which goes to 
the team with the best style.

Marathon benefit UF Health Shands Children’s Hospital, as it is the local Children’s Miracle Network Hospital, said Molly Vazquez, a 21-year-old UF public relations senior and public relations overall chair for Dance Marathon

The Florida Players is offering the chance 
to get a play produced at its annual New 
Works Festival.
The festival lets residents and students 
submit a play to be considered for produc-tion. 
It is funded by Student Government. 
“This year is looking really, really good,” 
said artistic director Megan Wicks. “It’s just 
an opportunity for new playwrights to get their work out there and to actually see it done.”
Two shows will be featured in this year’s 
festival, which will take place on Nov. 22, 24 and 25.
The plays will be held on campus in the 
McGuire Pavilion Black Box Theatre.The shows include “Change Provided,” a 
play that takes place in a toll booth on Inter-
state 4 in Orlando. 
The other play is “Mullier Ridiculum,” 
which is a sketch comedy show.
Lauren Killer, publicist for Florida Play-
ers, said the advantage of the Florida Play-
ers is that it gives students a chance to get involved in theater.
The selection committee usually receives 
about 10 submissions, and it then chooses 
one to three shows to put on during the fes-

� IT COULD REDUCE THE NEED 
FOR FULL MASTECTOMIES. 
DANIELLE HILTON
Alligator Contributing Writer
Kristin Babik was 15 when she 
found out her mom had breast cancer.
Babik, now a 20-year-old UF psy-
chology and criminology junior, said 
her mother’s cancer was caught early. 
She survived but had a mastectomy.
Now, a drug called Perjeta recently 
approved for new use could diminish 
the need for full mastectomies.
Alan Shealy, a local pharmacist, 
said Perjeta turns off a protein called HER2  that makes cancer cells divide and grow faster. 
“Before surgery, they can use this 
drug to shrink the tumor,” Shealy said. “That means the breast can be saved a lot of times so that cancer patients don’t have to have a full mastectomy.”
Nearly 20 percent of breast cancers 
demonstrate increased amounts of HER2, according to a Food and Drug Administration news release. 
Babik said Perjeta sounds like a step 
forward.
“I think it’s great as long as it’s safe 
and no one’s harmed in the trials of it,” she said.
Paul Doering, professor emeritus in 
UF’s College of Pharmacy, said Perjeta has been on the market since 2012 but was only approved late last month for use prior to surgery.
“The main study used to test this 
drug was so impressive that it would be considered unethical to not come up with a mechanism to make it widely available to patients,” he said.
Doering said Perjeta is used with 
two other drugs, and the three-drug treatment costs between $27,000 and $49,000, depending on the duration of treatment time. 
“It’s hard to ﬁ  nd silver linings in 
medicine, and this is something to shout about,” Doering said. “It’s not a cure, but it’s deﬁ  nitely something to 
shout about.”New cancer drug approved
“This year is looking really, really 
good . . . It’s just an opportunity for 
new playwrights to get their work out 
there and to actually see it done.”

Glitches stall 
health care rollout
One day, our great-great-great grandchildren will laugh 
at our Dark-Ages digital technology — most likely while cruising around on jet packs and buying Google 
Glasses out of vending machines. They’ll probably speak of the stalled healthcare.gov website the same way we speak of 
rotary telephones and dial-up Internet.
Because, let’s be honest: It’s ridiculous. Since its launch, 
healthcare.gov has experienced technical difﬁ  culties that have 
prevented Americans from signing up for the program that — aside from excessive and undue drone attacks and Michelle’s arms/bangs/anti-obesity campaign — has come to deﬁ  ne Ba-rack Obama’s presidency.
Yesterday, according to Reuters, Obama held a meeting at 
the White House Rose Garden with consumers, small business 
owners and pharmacists who have been affected by the new 
law to attempt damage control.
A White House ofﬁ  cial said Obama found the glitches “un-
acceptable” and plans to address the issue head-on. Reuters also reported the president and his team would bring in tech experts from both inside and outside the government to repair problems with the website — but it’s unclear how long that will take.  
In the meantime, White House administration ofﬁ  cials are 
poised to travel the country and encourage people to sign up for health care. But if the website problems aren’t resolved in time, the American people who support the Affordable Care Act may lose conﬁ  dence in its ability to succeed — and op-ponents of Obamacare will have ammunition to criticize it further.
The whole ordeal calls into question the federal govern-
ment’s decision to rely on CGI Federal, a subsidiary of a Ca-nadian ﬁ  rm called CGI Group, to orchestrate the creation of 
healthcare.gov. More details about the Canadian company 
have surfaced in the wake of Obamacare’s technical woes, and they’re not pretty.
“Experience in similar types of projects is very important in 
getting federal contracts,” according to the Washington Post. “CGI had done work in the health care arena, and not all of it good: Its performance on Ontario, Canada’s health-care medi-cal registry for diabetes sufferers was so poor that ofﬁ  cials ditched the $46.2 million contract after three years of missed 
deadlines.”
CGI isn’t wholly responsible, though, the Post reported. A 
number of issues may have contributed to the rocky rollout: 
Not enough funding, hastily written code and the entire feder-al procurement apparatus, which makes it harder for smaller IT companies to bid on federal government jobs.
On the surface, the healthcare.gov problems may seem like 
a simple technical hiccup. This is not the case, though: Many internal, back-end issues are hindering the success of the pro-
gram. It’s a shame, too — we want Obamacare to work, we 
really do. But if the technical issues aren’t resolved swiftly, even supporters of health care will have a hard time justifying a system that’s so broken.Tea Party strategy ﬂ  awed, substance OK
With the government shutdown behind us, the 
media is declaring winners and losers. No mat-ter what poll or TV station you turn to, there 
always seems to be universal disapproval for the House 
Tea Party Caucus.
Though passionate and fearless, Tea Party politicians 
lack a clear vision of how to reach their goals. It seems as 
though their only approach to an issue or speciﬁ  c policy is to attack it head-on unilaterally, regardless of any political ramiﬁ  cations.
The main reason the Tea Party base is so unhappy is 
because Washington has not embraced a true center-right 
policy change in decades. Even during the golden age of 
the Reagan Administration, America experienced rising debt, a continuation of entitlement programs and tax in-creases. During the Bush years, the government continued to explode with more departments and bureaucracy. The Tea Party base has credible reasons to be unhappy.
But instead of having a comprehensive plan of action 
and general legislative approach to deal with policy is-sues, Tea Party politicians simply throw themselves into a ﬁ  ght with no vision of an endgame other than the be-lief that they should win. Most of these politicians were elected to enact change immediately and refuse to com-promise. However, our system of government requires our branches to work with each other slowly to reach leg-islative solutions.
And most of the policy issues the group brings up are 
pressing issues. The debt America continues to pile on will 
continue to negatively affect the nation for years to come. 
Entitlements are hopelessly mismanaged and costing us more and more every day. And having an inefﬁ  cient gov-ernment that continues to grow is not a good thing. There is not necessarily a problem with Tea Party substance; the problem is with the Tea Party strategy.
As we have seen, the government cannot be run from 
a minority of the minority party. But if you want to be-
come a majority party, you can’t pull off stunts like a faux-ﬁ  libuster and a shutdown of the 
government. With the 2014 mid-term elections in sight, the Re-publican Party should be assess-
ing what it did wrong in the past 
and working to gain a majority in the Senate.  
In addition to this, an insane 
strategy from the Tea Party base is comparing how conservative 
Republican politicians are. Great Republican politicians like New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Sen. Pat 
Toomey (R-Pa.) — Republicans who are serving in blue 
and purple states — should not be subjected to questions about their conservativeness. Unlike failed Tea Party candidates such as Richard Mourdock and Todd Akin, Christie and Toomey are in ofﬁ  ce, governing from the right and, most importantly, winning elections. The base should realize that instead of getting our own incumbent 
Republican politicians out of ofﬁ  ce, we should be getting 
the Democratic politicians out.    
It is interesting to also point out that though the Repub-
lican Party is viewed unfavorably nationally, on a state-level the party is viewed favorably.
New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez, Wisconsin 
Governor Scott Walker and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal are the true standard-bearers for the GOP. They are governing effectively from a center-right position and have Democrats giving them positive approval ratings. 
No faux-ﬁ  libuster or state government shutdown needed. 
A few bad apples seem to be giving the Republican Party a bad name.   
With budget and immigration ﬁ  ghts on the horizon, all 
eyes will be on the Tea Party to see if they have learned anything from the shutdown ﬁ  ght. I, for one, hope they have.

If you had to make the unfortunate trek 
through Turlington Plaza last week, chances are you caught an eyeful of the 
Created Equal movement’s aborted fetus posters and stand-ups lining the walkways. 
The “graphic images ahead” signs weren’t 
quite emphatic enough to prepare us for what was there.
Yes, Turlington Plaza is a free speech 
zone. Neither the university nor anyone else can regulate the content or media expres-sions of those who assemble there. They may only regulate the time, place and man-ner. However, none of that means a visual 
shock-and-awe is in an appropriate or effec-
tive method of expressing a belief.
When I entered Turlington Plaza last 
Tuesday, I wasn’t angry with the Created Equal members. I admire their conviction, and they must be courageous to submit them-selves to the hostility of passersby. I wasn’t even angry at the images, though I believe them to be sensationalized. I was angry for 
every lady Gator who has had an abortion, 
willingly or not. I was angry for any woman considering one at the time she walked to class Tuesday only to be ambushed by everything she didn’t need to see. 
This has nothing to do with 
being pro-choice, pro-life or pro-anything. Regardless of anyone’s beliefs about abortion — and we all have an opinion there — does anyone feel it is acceptable to make students with abortion experiences feel uncomfortable on their own campus? No matter what the message, pre-sentation is everything. In my opinion, a 
less-hostile open dialogue would be a more 
productive model of outreach. There must be another viable medium that doesn’t feel like an ambush. If I were considering abor-tion, or simply on the fence about my beliefs, these seemingly extremist people are not the ones I would consult.
Created Equal executive director Mark 
Harrington says his platform targets “the 
mushy middle,” people who have no strong 
stance at either end of the abortion debate spectrum. 
I don’t believe such an au-
dience exists on a university campus. If you do exist, on-the-fence folks, here’s my mes-
sage to you: engage in civil, 
fact-based conversations with multiple people from both sides of the issue. Sharing beliefs and creating an open dialogue 
about social issues is a fundamental aspect of university life. One beauty of our campus is that it fosters constant exposure to new belief systems. No one here is naïve enough 
to want protection from opposing views. I 
imagine we all value them greatly. But this sideshow? It’s all a sensational stunt, an ex-hibition of the outlandish that serves only to needle young women into feeling guilty.
To the members of Created Equal, thank 
you for voicing your beliefs and exercising your right to free speech. However, is it too much to ask that women with abortion his-
tory or those considering it presently have a 
peaceful walk across their campus without being confronted by grisly photos of fetuses on coins? Is there not enough humanity in your movement to recognize the beneﬁ  ts of a different approach? Judging from the pamphlets that were available at the exhibit, 
I know you have other media at your dis-
posal. 
Regardless of my abortion views — 
which have probably become apparent any-way — it’s important to note these images are not from the typical procedure. Travel-ing pro-life groups are notorious for using photos of late-term abortions carried out for emergency reasons. Those interested should 
visit thisismyabortion.com for a glimpse of 
reality. 
To the girls this has affected negatively, 
those with past abortions or those consider-ing them when they saw the posters, I’m so sorry. 
Everyone I talked to that day had you in 
their thoughts, regardless of their personal beliefs.

Better resources for cyclists
I recently became an avid biker 
after a church friend gave me a 
bike. I used to bike everywhere on 
campus and in town when I was a University of Florida student in the 
1970s. Some streets around town 
don’t even have a bike lane.
Bicyclists are forced to use the 
sidewalk, which should be reserved 
for pedestrians. Sometimes if we 
have to use the sidewalk, there are 
tree branches blocking our path and 
debris all over the sidewalk. 
The city and property owners 
have mutual responsibility to keep the sidewalks clear for safe public use. 
Also, bikers and motorists need 
to be aware of each other and coex-ist better, for everyone’s safety. 
Finally, I ask the city to please 
check the operation of the buttons designed to give bikers and pedes-
trians safe crossing of streets. Some-
times I wait ﬁ  ve minutes to cross a street. Thank you to RTS for pro-
viding bike racks on its buses.

I just would like to say great 
job for having Michael Beato write a weekly column for the 
Alligator. 
Despite the fact that I do not 
agree with him on every issue, I appreciate having a sane, level-
headed, conservative-minded 
voice on the opinions section.
Even though the readership is 
pretty liberal, I think he caters his 
writings to that particular group, 
and he explains his point of view well. 
Though he is right of center, 
I have not heard him talk about the birther movement, legitimate 
rape or any other outlandish Re-
publican views — and for that I am truly thankful.
He is by far better than your 
conservative columnist last year. The differences are quite evi-
dent.
I highly encourage you to keep 
him on your paper because there are not many like him.

Pumpkin spice flavored groceries sit on the shelves of Trader Joe’s in Butler Plaza on Monday. The store has 
embraced the season and is currently selling many pumpkin-flavored ingredients and food products.
ELIZABETH BOONE

Pumpkin pie, pumpkin yo-
gurt, pumpkin body butter: It’s a 
pumpkin party in Gainesville.
From pumpkin spice season-
ing to actual fresh pumpkins, shoppers have an array of items to choose from starring the great 
gourd at stores like Trader Joe’s.
But some UF students might 
have already had enough. 
UF industrial engineering ju-
nior Lauren Neely, 20, certainly has.
“Everything is pumpkin-fla-
vored now,” Neely said.
Neely said she first noticed the 
fall flavor at Starbucks, which she 
liked, but soon McDonald’s and Dunkin’ Donuts had it, too.
She said she specifically no-
ticed the power of the pumpkin 
in the Trader Joe’s newsletter, 
which included numerous pump-kin recipes in the publication.
“It’s too in-your-face,” Neely 
said.
Others disagree.For example, a manager at 
Trader Joe’s in Butler Plaza said some local customers are order-ing pumpkin products by the case.
UF telecommunication se-
nior Jeanie Fletcher, 21, said she thinks the scent and food helps people get into the fall spirit.
Still, she won’t be rushing over 
to Trader Joe’s.
“I’ve never been a huge holi-
day person,” Fletcher said.
But UF animal science fresh-
man Courtney Crosby, 18, said she is OK with the pumpkin 
craze.
“It’s expected for pumpkins 
to come out in the fall,” Crosby 
said. “It’s the go-to theme.”
Although she’s not the biggest 
pumpkin fan, Crosby said she still likes the scent of pumpkin.
“It makes it feel like fall,” 
Crosby said.Pumpkin spice maybe not so nice: Fall products invade stores
� PARTICIPANTS PERFORMED 
BETTER ON COGNITIVE TESTS AFTER DOING YOGA. 
CLAIRE BOUGH
Alligator Contributing Writer
Yoga provides more immediate cog-
nitive benefits than aerobic exercise, 
which has a delayed effect, according to a recent study.
“Despite an increase in the preva-
lence of yoga exercise, research focusing on the relationship between yoga exer-cise and cognition is limited,” the study’s authors wrote.
In the study, 30 female undergradu-
ate students completed three cognitive tests during three visits.
Before the first test, they did not per-
form any exercise. Before the second test, 
they completed 20 minutes of Hatha yoga, and before the third, they complet-
ed 20 minutes of aerobic exercise.
After exercising, the participants 
completed simple tests on a computer 
screen that measured memory among 
other factors. The participants performed significantly better on the cognitive tests after yoga in comparison to aerobic and baseline assessments, said Neha Gothe, one of the study’s authors.
May Ko, a 24-year-old first-year doc-
tor of nursing practice student at UF, has realized the long-term benefits of yoga.
“I have more energy, and I feel better 
health-wise overall,” she said. “My pos-ture is better. I am generally happier.”
The study suggests it may be benefi-
cial to practice yoga directly before a task where brainpower is needed.
“Yoga is a mind-body activity, and 
clearly there is something about its prac-tice that leads to better cognition and 
thinking immediately after its practice,” 
Gothe said.Study: Yoga betters brainsCAMPUS

UF’s Black Student Union is preparing to 
hold a new competition on campus where stu-
dents can lip-synch their hearts out.
UF’s first campus-wide lip-synch competi-
tion, “The Vegas Decade Showdown,” is hosted by the union and slated for Oct. 28 in the Reitz Union Rion Ballroom.
The winner of each category will receive a 
trophy, and the overall winner will be awarded a $100 cash prize, said Janna Gilstrap, a 20 year-old UF telecommunication junior and BSU member.
The competition will be separated into four 
categories: Greek, individual, organization and group, Gilstrap said. 
The teams will be given an ‘80s, ‘90s or 2000s 
music category. Each team must create a rou-tine to a song from the decade.
About 20 teams have applied to participate 
in the show, Gilstrap said.
The competition will be judged by UF fac-ulty and staff members including the Institute of Black Culture director Vee Smith.
Performances will be judged based on cre-
ativity, originality, appearance and crowd ap-peal, Gilstrap said.
BSU is also encouraging audience members 
to wear an outfit that represents their favorite decade. The person with the best outfit will be awarded a prize.
Jah’tia Haynes, the special events director, 
said she expects the ballroom to be so full that they will have to stream the show in smaller surrounding rooms.
“You don’t have to know how to sing or 
dance,” the 20-year-old UF public relations junior said. “You just need to know how to have a good time.”BSU plans lip-synch competition

WILL HAVE ONLINE ACCESS.

For 40 percent of the world 
this year, the Internet could be a 
source of information, time-killing cat videos and a constant stream of Miley Cyrus tweets.
A recent United Nations re-
port projects that by the end of the year, about 2.7 billion people will have online access.
However, many countries in 
Africa and Asia remain underrep-resented in Internet use. 
“The Internet should become a norm, not a luxury,” said UF se-nior Ronald Quan.
Quan, the 22-year-old vice 
president of the UF chapter of Association for Computing Ma-chinery, said the Internet contains 
everything a person needs except 
for human contact.
But Dhanashree Thorat, a UF 
English graduate student who researches inequality in new me-dia, said this isn’t the case. Lack of access to computers, software and an Internet connection creates a gap in the kind of knowledge 
found on the Internet, she said.
“Wikipedia articles on non-
Western topics are sometimes 
underdeveloped or non-existent,” Thorat said.Sophia Acord, associate direc-
tor of the UF Center for the Hu-manities and the Public Sphere, said she questions the ability of the Internet to connect people globally when social biases still 
exist.
“People go on the Internet to 
find people who think like them,” 
she said.
This isolation has a variety of 
effects, she said, like making it difficult for political systems — especially democracy — to work efficiently.
Still, Acord said, the Internet 
has been helpful in certain cases. It allows immigrants and political activists to connect to each other and express their ideas.In places like India and sub-
Saharan Africa, she said, the cell-phone is more significant to daily life than the Internet. Networks of communication have developed more around texting than tweet-
ing.
“Do you need the Internet 
there? Sure,” Acord said. “Have 
they been waiting for it? No.”
Thorat said she recommends 
people in more Internet-dependent groups, like college students, be-come more socially aware online, where information can be biased. 
Students, she said, should recog-
nize that technology is shaped by the culture that creates it. 
 “The Internet is not a utopian 
space,” she said.

Another one rides the bus.
In an effort to reduce carbon emissions, the UF Of-
ﬁ  ce of Sustainability asks students, faculty and staff to use alternative forms of transportation on Wednesday for One Less Car Day. 
“We’ll be on the Plaza of the Americas from 11 a.m. 
till 2 p.m. with information and some fun activities and things for people,” said Laurel Nesbit, program man-ager for the Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability.
Since 2008, about 5,000 people have signed up for 
One Less Car Day, she said.
Samantha Blanco, a 19-year-old UF computer sci-
ence sophomore, said she does not have a car and get-ting to campus is not a problem.
“I just take the bus anywhere I need to go,” she said. 
“I have like six to choose from.”
Nesbit said the Ofﬁ  ce of Sustainability spent about $5,000 on the campaign this year.
UF has a goal to be carbon neutral by 2025, Nesbit 
said. Transportation accounts for 11 percent of the car-bon footprint on campus.
“One Less Car Day is a way for students, faculty 
and staff to really take action to reduce their own car-bon footprint on campus and on the planet,” she said. One Less Car Day rolls into UF again 
� THE PLAN WILL BAR 
NONCITIZENS FROM VOTER ROLLS. 
HANNAH MORSE
Alligator Contributing Writer
The state government is 
adding a new system for cross-
checking voter rolls, and Alachua 
County is moving toward 
implementing it.
Ken Detzner, a Republican 
and Florida’s Secretary of State, 
recently completed his ﬁ  ve-city 
tour around Florida, aiming to educate about an improved plan to bar noncitizens from state voter rolls, which are lists of 
registered voters in an area. 
Formerly, Florida used the 
driver’s license database from the 
Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles to 
determine whether someone was 
a citizen and therefore eligible to vote. 
This database only changes 
when someone makes a 
transaction directly with the 
department, which could be once every four years for license renewal, said Pam Carpenter, 
the Alachua County Supervisor 
of Elections. 
Last year, the DMV database 
excluded war veterans in the rolls, The New York Times reported.
Florida will also be using the 
SAVE Program administered 
by the U.S. Department of 
Homeland Security to compare databases and determine if someone is eligible to vote, Carpenter said.
SAVE, short for Systematic 
Alien Veriﬁ  cation for Entitlements, was created to ensure immigrants were 
receiving their entitled beneﬁ  ts. 
Now, it will also prevent them from voting illegally. 
Carpenter said she sees how 
the change is an improvement 
but said she knows it isn’t 
foolproof.
“The question is that how 
quickly is that information going 
to be up there, and how is that 
going to affect new citizens,” she said. “We want to make sure the list that we get from the state or the documentation we get from 
the state is credible and reliable.”
UF political science professor 
Richard Scher said he doesn’t 
agree with keeping noncitizens 
from voter rolls.
“In the long history of this 
country, noncitizens could vote. 
That all changed in the 1920s,” he said.
He said that today some 
U.S. cities, including Chicago, allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. 
Carpenter said the new 
process is about respecting existing federal laws.
“The bottom line is you need 
to be a U.S. citizen,” she said. “So 
it’s important that we continue 
to do ﬁ  le updates and keep them clean.”Florida to examine 
voter rolls more closely

UF volleyball’s offense 
struggled to gain any momentum against Missouri. Read the story on page 14.UF midﬁ  elder honored 
The Southeastern Conference named Lauren Smith the SEC Defensive Player of the Week Monday. Smith scored twice against Kentucky on Friday.  JOE MORGAN

  Through ﬁ  ve games, no opponent could run effectively 
against Florida.
  The Gators kicked off in Baton Rouge, La., on Oct. 12 with 
the nation’s second-ranked rush defense. Toledo, Miami, 
Tennessee, Kentucky and Arkansas averaged only 65 yards per game on the ground against Florida.
  But stopping Tigers from running has proven problematic 
for the Gators, who gave up 380 rushing yards on 76 carries in back-to-back losses to LSU and Missouri.
  “We need to play better defensively,” coach Will Mus-
champ said. 
“We need to play the run better, take more pride in our 
performance and how we’re playing on the ﬁ  eld. That falls on me. We’re going to work and we’re going to get it done.”
  Each Tigers team had a rusher eclipse the 100-yard mark in 
the ground game against Florida’s defense. 
LSU’s Jeremy Hill and Mizzou’s Henry Josey ran for 121 
and 136 yards, respectively. 
Georgia’s Todd Gurley was the lone opponent to rush for 
more than 100 yards against Florida last season, doing so dur-ing the Bulldogs’ 17-9 victory.
  Problems against Missouri stemmed from the absence of 
defensive tackles Dominique Easley (torn ACL) and Damien 
Jacobs, who did not play on Saturday due to lingering effects Gators struggle to stop run in back-to-back losses

AS STEIN ON TV
 After Florida defeated Toledo 24-6 on 
Mack Brown’s shoulders, the Alli-gator ran the headline: “What Can 
Brown Do For You?”
  Since then, the answer has been, “not 
much.”
  Brown has sputtered, and in the mean-
time, freshman Kelvin Taylor has excelled. 
It’s time for coach Will Muschamp and 
offensive coordinator Brent Pease to end the Mack Brown experiment and start Tay-lor.
  Taylor made his best case for the starting 
job on Saturday against Missouri.
  The Tigers defense shut down every oth-
er facet of the Gators’ offense. Taylor was 
the lone exception. 
The true freshman, playing in the ﬁ  fth 
game of his career in front of a hostile 
crowd, notched 74 yards on 12 carries.
  Meanwhile, Brown ran for 19 yards on 
eight rushes for a meager 2.4 yards per carry.
  Taylor has excelled every time he has 
been given a chance to succeed.  When Taylor 
entered the game against Toledo — 
to rapturous ap-
plause ﬁ  tting of a Heisman winner, not a freshman — 
he pounded the 
ball for 43 yards on ﬁ  ve carries. He 
averaged four more yards per rush than Brown, who had a superb game.
  Taylor barely saw the ﬁ  eld for the rest of 
September. 
  Florida stuck with Brown and starting 
sophomore Matt Jones despite their medio-
cre performances against Miami and Ten-
nessee; Taylor got one carry for 3 yards.
  Jones looked like he would establish his 
hold on the position after a stellar game against Kentucky, rushing for 176 yards 
and a score, but he suffered season-ending 
torn meniscus early in the game against Taylor should be UF’s starter

   Taylor Travis epitomizes how the 
Gators want to play this season. 
  The senior outside back usually 
comes off the bench, but when she steps onto the ﬁ  eld, she lets her feet do the work.
  Statistics do not show the full story 
of what Travis did in her 65 minutes of action on Friday and Sunday. She was quick to challenge any opponent who went to attack the ball on the ﬂ  ank.
  Travis was swift on her feet against 
a physical LSU team on Sunday, mak-ing sure to defend against players threatening Florida’s possession.
  With how productive she has been 
on the ﬁ  eld, it would be hard to tell she has been banged up this year.
  “She’s battled these little crazy 
injuries all season,” coach Becky Bur-leigh said, “and it’s hard for her to have consistent playing time because 
of that.”
  “She’s starting to get more and 
more healthy. You’ll see her role con-
tinue to grow as long as she’s consis-tent, and she’s proven that so far in 
the last couple of games.”

successful weekend because of their Senior widening playing

  The Gators were riding high following nine straight 
sweeps and 13 consecutive wins entering the weekend. 
Both streaks came to a halt as Florida’s offense struggled. 
  No. 18 Missouri, one of two undefeated teams in the na-
tion, defeated No. 2 Florida in four sets, declaring that the Southeastern Conference is still up for grabs. 
   “Sunday’s match was a terriﬁ  c environment for volley-
ball,” coach Mary Wise said. 
 “They had a great crowd, and this Missouri team, with 
all of the experience they returned last year and their young 
players, played terriﬁ  c against us.
  “It was a high-level volleyball match.  Those ﬁ  rst three 
sets couldn’t get any closer. I just felt that Missouri made a few more plays and they were the better team.”
  Florida’s performance during the weekend — which also 
included a four-set win against Arkansas — was  uncharac-teristic of the way the team has played the entire season. 
  Heading into the road matches, Florida ranked second in 
the nation in both hitting percentage at (.336) and kills per set at (15.17). 
  But that offense all but disappeared when UF visited Fay-
etteville, Ark., and Columbia, Mo. In Friday’s match against the Razorbacks, the Gators hit just .237.
  Sunday’s outing was much of the same as Florida only hit 
.237, and Missouri recorded 9.5 blocks.  “We’ve always said you learn more from a loss than you 
do from a win,” Wise said.  “All credit has to go to how well Missouri played.”
  The players who have carried the team offensively for 
much of the season were a virtual no-show during the week-end. 
O  utside hitter Gabby Mallette has been one of UF’s most 
consistent players this season, but the sophomore hit just .192 
against Arkansas and .059 against Missouri. 
  The same can be said for senior 
middle blocker Chloe Mann. 
  Mann has been unstoppable in al-
most every match, but she also failed 
to get anything going, hitting just .231 against the Tigers. 
  Despite the strong play the Gators have had from their 
young players, the key to pushing them over the edge will be 
if sophomore outside hitter Ziva Recek can return to the level 
of play she showed during her freshman year. 
  Recek has failed to make much of an impact so far this 
season.  
She was second on the team in kills with 15 against Mis-
souri but was second worst in hitting percentage with a .120 clip on 50 attempts. 
   Florida (18-2, 7-1 SEC), which entered the weekend unde-
feated in conference play, is now one game behind Missouri 
(23-0, 7-0) in the loss column with 10 matches remaining dur-
ing regular season play.   Florida offense sputters in ﬁ  rst SEC loss

Texas A&M on Oct. 4 in the O’Connell Center.
UF VolleyballLSU on Oct. 12.
Taylor looked better against the LSU defense than 
either Jones or Brown, rushing for 5.2 yards per carry 
versus a defense that limited UF to six points.
Taylor is simply the Gators’ best running back. At 
this point, the argument is settled.
Since Brown’s solid season-opening performance, 
the redshirt junior has averaged 3.3 yards per rush. 
That just does not cut it for a team whose offense is based around pounding the football.
Florida needs a running back who can make plays 
like the one Taylor made against Missouri.
While the Tigers stifled Brown, the freshman man-
aged to find the end zone and score the Gators’ sole offensive touchdown of the game. 
It was also Florida’s longest play of the afternoon. 
The Gators cannot keep plowing forward with the 
same rushing attack. If Florida’s offensive line keeps failing to protect quarterback Tyler Murphy, then UF 
needs a running back who can get past the line.
Taylor is the Gators’ only player who can consis-
tently be a threat out of the backfield. If defenses see Brown lining up, they can play people back to guard 
the pass without worrying about Brown breaking off 
a big run. 
He has not shown he can do that against a South-
eastern Conference defense. Taylor has. 
He averaged 5.7 yards per carry against the No. 3 
and No. 8 rush defenses in the conference. Opposing defenses have to respect him.
Muschamp has been saying since fall camp that 
Taylor is great at running the ball, even if he was sub-
standard at other aspects of the position.
Right now, Florida needs a playmaker more than 
it needs a blocker or receiver in the backfield — al-
though it needs those, too. 
If UF’s season has any chance of being salvaged, 
the Gators need someone to step up.
It’s time to free Kelvin.fundamental play.
After going into the week-
end with a 4-2 Southeastern 
Conference record, Florida 
clawed its way back to a prime position in the league with 3-0 sweeps against Ken-
tucky and LSU.
Holding the league fore-
runners to a combined 10 
shots was due in large part to Florida’s depth in defensive 
roles.
Burleigh switched out 
multiple players in the out-
side back roles throughout 
Sunday’s matchup against 
LSU at James G. Pressly Sta-dium, with all making effort to break down LSU’s de-fense. 
“If we play quickly and 
we execute, it’s hard to de-fend, because no defender moves faster than the ball,” 
Burleigh said. “We just kind 
of have to keep that trend go-ing and make sure we work on the hustle stats that are 50/50 balls and defending 
things like set pieces.”
Florida’s risky strategy of 
sending outside backs for-
ward in the attack has paid 
off so far.
Against Kentucky on Fri-
day, Florida scored all three 
goals while utilizing the flanks.
Outside back Claire Fal-
knor ran up the near side and found junior midfielder Havana Solaun near the cor-
ner. Falknor made the pass, 
and Solaun made a cross into the box that found Lauren Smith’s right foot. She took the shot for Florida’s first 
goal of the night.
Solaun then transferred to the far flank in the sec-
ond half to find Smith again 
in prime scoring position en 
route to Florida’s final goal of the game.
Outside back Lauren Sil-
ver helped Florida grab a 
cushion lead before halftime 
and quickly ran up the far flank to make a cross to fresh-man midfielder Liz Slattery.
The freshman took the 
shot from 21 yards out to get the 2-0 lead over the Wild-cats.
Burleigh said going back 
to the one-two-touch style 
the team is comfortable with 
helped with the wins.
“Our team takes a lot of 
pride in the way that we 
play, and they also take a 
lot of pride in being a close team,” Burleigh said. 
“We want to see what that 
looks like on the field, and 
we’re starting to see some of 
that.”
Florida’s weekend shut-
outs improve its conference 
record to 6-2, tying with 
Kentucky for second in the league.
“We expect to get better 
every game,” Burleigh said. 
“We’re either getting better 
or getting worse, and right now we’re getting better.”TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

from page 13Three ranked SEC teams upset by unranked opponents
from a head injury he suffered during a pile-up at the goal 
line against LSU.
The same issues on the line of scrimmage that plagued 
the Gators in Baton Rouge carried over to Columbia, Mo. Twenty of Mizzou’s 37 rush attempts gained 5 yards or more.
The dagger was a 50-yard carry by Josey late in the 
third quarter with the Tigers leading 23-17. The play sparked a run of 13 straight points that helped Missouri ice the game.
“Can’t give up big plays,” Buck linebacker Dante 
Fowler Jr. said. 
“We gave up a lot of big plays. That hurt us. Our job 
is to get them off the field with three-and-outs and things like that. We can’t give up big plays like 
that.”
Sloppy Saturday: Despite the ugli-
ness of Florida’s 36-17 loss to Missouri, 
Saturday could have been worse for the 
Gators. Five ranked teams lost to un-ranked opponents during a weekend of upsets.
Florida’s next opponent, injury-rav-
aged Georgia, fell from No. 15 to out of the top 25 after a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt in Nashville, Tenn. The Bulldogs blew a 13-point lead, fumbling on back-to-back posses-sions in the fourth quarter and allowing the Commodores 
to score 17 unanswered points in the game’s final 15 min-
utes.
UCF was on the right side of another upset, toppling 
then-eighth-ranked Louisville 38-35 in Louisville, Ky., on Friday night. Knights quarterback Blake Bortles threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Godfrey with 23 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter for the game-winning score.
Two more upsets occurred in the Southeastern Con-
ference when formerly 11th-ranked South Carolina fell to Tennessee 23-21, and then-No. 6 LSU lost to Ole Miss 27-24.
The Volunteers defeated the Gamecocks with a 19-yard 
field goal as time expired, ending Tennessee’s 19-game losing streak against ranked opponents. 
The game also marked the first Saturday since Oct. 9, 
2004, that UF, UGA and USC all lost.
Formerly 20th-ranked Washington capped a wild day 
by falling to unranked Arizona State 53-24. The Sun Dev-ils dominated the ground game, rushing for 314 yards compared to the Huskies’ minus-5. football , from page 13

  With Week 7 of the NFL sea-
son in the books, here are a few 
former Gators who made the most tangible impact for their respective teams.
  Jordan Reed, tight end: 
During the Washington Red-skins’ 45-41 victory against 
the Chicago Bears, Reed 
made Gators fans long even more for their starting tight end from a year ago. 
  A third-round selection 
in the 2013 NFL Draft, Reed 
caught a career-high nine 
passes from Washington quarterback Robert Grifﬁ  n III for 134 receiving yards and the second touchdown of his career. His score — a 3-yard reception — put the Redskins ahead 24-17 with 27 seconds remaining in the 
ﬁ  rst half.
  The 6-foot-2 tight end’s 
longest reception was a 38-
yard gain on the third offen-sive play of the game. 
  Reed won the battle 
against Chicago’s linebacker core, which features Jon Bos-tic — Reed’s teammate last 
season at Florida. 
  Bostic tied for a team-best 
eight tackles with ﬁ  ve other 
Bears, but he could not stop Reed from shredding the Bears’ pass defense. 
  Riley Cooper, wide re-
ceiver: A game after a 120-yard performance that saw him score his ﬁ  rst touchdown of 2013, Cooper notched a team-high 88 yards Sunday 
against the Dallas Cowboys. 
He caught six passes on sev-en targets.
  Cooper’s 26-yard recep-tion from quarterback Matt Barkley late in the fourth quarter was the longest by an Eagle all afternoon.
  Unfortunately for Coo-
per, his performance was not enough to lift Philadelphia, which fell 17-3 to Dallas at home on Sunday.  Notes: During the second 
quarter of the Miami Dol-phins’ 23-21 home loss to the Buffalo Bills, Dolphins rookie kicker Caleb Sturgis missed a 51-yard ﬁ  eld goal attempt that hit the right upright of the goalpost. 
The miss was only his sec-ond this season. 
  Also during the loss, 
Dolphins rookie linebacker Jelani Jenkins stirred up controversy when he drilled Bills quarterback Thad Lewis on a near helmet-to-helmet hit after a completed pass on third and 11. 
Jenkins was ﬂ  agged for 
15 yards for roughing the passer.
  In the New York Jets’ over-
time win against the New England Patriots, Jets wide-out David Nelson caught four passes for a season-high 80 yards. 
Also in the game, Pats 
linebacker Brandon Spikes recorded 11 tackles with one for a loss of yardage. 
  Cincinnati Bengals defen-
sive end Carlos Dunlap re-corded ﬁ  ve tackles and two quarterback hits during his team’s 27-24 win against the 
Detroit Lions. 
Dunlap also blocked a 
ﬁ  eld goal attempt by David 
Akers from 34 yards out, which was recovered by for-mer Gators and current Ben-gals safety Reggie Nelson, in the second quarter.
  Baltimore Ravens free 
safety Matt Elam made three tackles — one for loss — and recovered a fumble by Steel-ers tight end Heath Miller in the second quarter.
  Running back Jeff Demps 
(groin) was inactive for the 0-6 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who lost to the Atlanta Fal-
cons 31-23 — their fourth 
loss this year by fewer than 10 points. 
Demps is out indeﬁ  nitely, 
according to Bucs coach Greg Schiano. 16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 22, 2013

  Alexandra Cercone nearly won her ﬁ  rst 
tournament of the season at the 2013 USTA/
ITA Southeast Regional Championships on Monday.
  The senior fell short against her singles 
ﬁ  nals opponent, Silvia Garcia, losing 7-6 (2), 
6-1.
  Cercone battled in the ﬁ  rst set but dropped 
the tiebreak. With her win, Garcia, who plays 
for Georgia, claimed the regional title and earned an automatic entry into the USTA/ITA National Indoor Intercollegiate Champi-onships.
  Cercone must now wait for an invitation 
to the national event held at the USTA Billie 
Jean King National Tennis Center in Flush-ing, N.Y. 
Despite her loss, coach Roland Thorn-
qvist said he thought Cercone played well. 
  “Alex improved every day at this tourna-
ment,” he said. “She was very tough.” 
  Cercone was not the only player to make 
an impression at the tournament.   Seven 
Gators combined for a 17-0 singles and dou-bles record on Friday. 
Cercone collected her 98th career singles 
win in the semiﬁ  nals, while Olivia Janowicz and Stefani Stojic reached the doubles quar-terﬁ  nals. Kourtney Keegan and Belinda Wool-cock also reached the doubles semiﬁ  nals.
  “I’m really looking forward to the spring 
season,” Thornqvist said.  
  Florida will now head to Orlando, where 
the Gators will compete in the USTA Clay Court Invitational beginning Thursday.  Senior drops
