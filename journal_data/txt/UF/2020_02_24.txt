Hunter Barco was dealing through-
out the early stages of Sunday after-
noon’s showdown between Florida 
and Miami.
He had allowed zero hits in his 
ﬁ  rst three scoreless innings, display-
ing his arsenal of pitches for the 
sold-out crowd at Mark Light Field 
in Coral Gables, Florida.
The freshman left-hander, how-
ever, started to lose command in the 
bottom of the fourth.
After walking the ﬁ  rst batter of 
the inning and giving up a single 
to UM catcher Adrian Del Castillo, 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan and catch-
er Nathan Hickey approached the 
mound.
The decision was made to keep 
Barco in the game, but the Hurri-
canes scored their ﬁ  rst run of the 
contest off a sacriﬁ  ce ﬂ  y from Ray-
mond Gil in the subsequent at-bat to 
cut UF’s lead to two.
O’Sullivan made his way back to 
the mound in the ﬁ  fth inning with 
his team up by three runs, as Barco 
found himself in a bases-loaded jam. 
But O’Sullivan stuck with his fresh-Barco shines in

THE LOT WILL 
CLOSE IN DECEMBER
By Noah Ram

UF can stand to lose hundreds more parking spots by 
the end of the year, thanks to a building that’ll take its 
place.
The surface parking lot at the corner of Museum Road 
and Center Drive across the street from the Reitz Union 
will close by the end of 2020, according to UF Transporta-
tion and Parking Services’ current master plan.
A new UF data science and information technology 
building will open on that site in November 2022, accord-
ing to the UF Land Use and Facilities Planning Committee.
The surface lot, which is an orange faculty decal lot, 
has 350 spaces.
Linda Dixon, the director of campus planning, wrote in 
an email this location was chosen because the new build-
ing’s tenants will come from the UF health colleges to the south and the Herbert Wertheim College of Engineering 
to the north.
There are no immediate plans for the lot across the 
street at the southeast corner of Museum Road and Center 
Drive next to Frazier Rogers Hall, Dixon said.
However, that side of the parking lot is listed as a fu-
ture building site in the current campus master plan.
Dixon said there are no funds for the building yet for 
that site, but the university is updating its master plan for 
the next decade and will determine if a building goes there 
by 2030.
Craig Hill, UF’s associate vice president of business af-
fairs, oversees parking and said parking options have to 
move when the campus evolves.
“This is nothing unusual for a college campus to have 
campus development relocate,” Hill said. 
Hill wrote in an email, “The new building will house 
faculty and researchers from the College of Medicine, 
College of Pharmacy, and the Herbert Wertheim Col-
lege of Engineering, who specialize in analyzing massive UF to close parking lot near Reitz Union
HE’S ACCUSED OF USING

A UF employee was behind 
bars after a child pornography in-
vestigation led authorities to cam-
pus Wi-Fi. 
Authorities executed a search 
warrant Thursday at 26-year-
old Timothy Turner’s home near 
Gainesville High School. He 
lives with his wife and two oth-
er roommates, according to the Gainesville Police Department ar-
rest report. 
Turner has been a data entry 
specialist with UF’s family nutri-
tion program since 2016, accord-
ing to his LinkedIn.  
The National Center for Miss-
ing and Exploited Children re-
ceived a tip in September 2019 
that a user on Discord, a chat app 
for gamers, shared three sexually 
exploitative images of children, 
according to the report. An inves-
tigation traced the IP address of 
the user back to Turner. 
Turner is accused of using 
UF’s Wi-Fi network on campus

Lawren Simmons /Alligator Staff4   ALLIGATOR    MONDAY, FEBRUARY 24, 2020THE FAMIL Y OF A GIRL 
KILLED IN A HIT-AND-
RUN SPOKE OUT
By Samia Lagmis
Alligator Staff Writer
Earlier this week, Vickie 
Hall collapsed at a Publix while 
paying for her groceries. 
She said her legs gave out 
when she saw the cashier’s 
nametag read Hannah — 
the name of her 14-year-old 
daughter who was killed 
during a hit-and-run accident 
in October while walking home 
with friends.
At a press conference 
Friday for Florida Hit-and-Run 
Awareness Month, Hall held a 
photo of her daughter smiling at 
the beach against her chest as 
Florida Highway Patrol officials 
spoke at the press conference 
on the importance of staying at 
the scene of a crash.
There has been a dramatic 
trend of an increase in hit-and-
run crashes in Florida, said 
FHP spokesperson Lt. Patrick 
Riordan.
He said there were about 
102,000 in 2017, 103,000 in 
2018, and almost 105,000 in 
2019.
Of the 105,000 crashes, 206 
people died, Riordan said. 
FHP flyers for the 
#StayAtTheSceneFL campaign 
were distributed at the FHP 
Station, located at 6300 NW 
13th St. The flyers listed 
penalties of property damages, 
injuries and fatalities associated 
with fleeing an accident. 
Four people were killed in 
pedestrian or cyclist related 
crashes in Alachua County in 
January alone — a number 
Gainesville Police Department 
spokesperson Jorge Campos 
said is higher than usual for the 
time of year.
Hit-and-run crashes are 
occurring at an alarming rate 
in Florida, said FHP Troop B 
Major William Tierney. Troop 
B includes nine counties: 
Columbia, Suwannee, 
Hamilton, Alachua, Dixie, 
Gilchrist, Levy, Lafayette and 
Marion.
In January, 16-year-old DJ 
Washington, 21-year-old Denise 
Griffiths, 45-year-old William 
Moore and an unnamed female 
cyclist were struck and killed 
in Alachua County. The driver 
who hit the cyclist has not been 
found and the victim’s family 
has not yet been notified, GPD 
spokesperson Jorge Campos 
said.
Tierney said leaving the 
scene of the crash “will only 
make things worse.” Under 
Florida law, he said drivers must stop immediately at the 
scene of a crash on both public 
and private roads.
He said it’s important for 
drivers involved in hit-and-run 
crashes to remain calm, remove 
their keys and get to a safe 
place before checking on other 
drivers and calling 911.
Corey Brown, father of 
Hannah Brown, cleared his 
throat and fought back tears as 
he expressed his thanks to the 
FHP for their help investigating 
his daughter’s case.
The hit-and-run driver, 
Brandon Holt of Waldo, was 
found and arrested by FHP 
eight days after the incident. 
“It’s hard to find the right 
words for anybody,” Brown 
said. “I’m lost and a lot of 
people are lost.”
Riordan said experts with 
the troop “work diligently 
to factually conclude what 
occurred before, during 
and after a fatality crash” 
so applicable laws can be 
enforced. 
He said the troop is very 
aware of the impact traffic 
fatality crashes have on 
families.
“Lives can be shattered 
when drivers fail to stop and 
help victims involved in a 
crash,” Riordan said. 
Hall said the loss of her 
daughter affects her every day. 
She is already a grandmother 
and said she struggles with the 
fact that she won’t ever have 
any grandchildren from her 
daughter.
“I still wake up and I want 
to know why I can’t hug my 
daughter,” Hall said.

slagmis@alligator.orgFlorida Highway Patrol 
discusses hit-and-runs
By Hannah Phillips
Alligator Staff Writer
Summers are getting hotter, said 
a retired UF professor. The Paynes 
Prairie basin isn’t draining, and lo-
cal crops are suffering. Their farmers 
are, too. 
Deborah Scheuer, chair of Gaines-
ville’s Climate Reality Project and 
former UF associate professor, said 
she sees climate change everywhere 
she looks. One place she doesn’t is 
on the university’s list of priorities. 
UF’s Office of Sustainability is 
taking steps to change that. 
With the help of students and fac-
ulty, UF is in the process of updating 
the university’s Climate Action Plan. 
The plan was developed in 2009 and 
is set to undergo complete revision 
by 2021, said Hannah Ulloa, the UF 
Office of Sustainability spokesper-
son. 
Ulloa said the new plan will be 
broken into six objectives: energy, 
transportation, infrastructure, aca-
demics, finance and resilience.
The goals of these six objectives 
are still largely undefined. The office 
hosted a listening session Wednes-day to better understand student, 
faculty and community concerns be-
fore revising the plan, Ulloa said.
Some attendees suggested the of-
fice develop an environmental sus-
tainability curriculum for UF profes-
sors to use, she said. Others asked 
that the new plan expand alternative 
forms of transportation for students 
and faculty to commute to campus, 
Ulloa said. 
Faculty and student travel make 
up only 20 percent of UF’s total en-
ergy usage, said Matthew Williams, 
the director of the UF Office of Sus-
tainability. A remaining 76 percent 
of energy is expended on-campus air 
conditioning and electricity systems. 
Wednesday’s session was the 
first of many to come, Ulloa said. As 
of Thursday, she and her team were 
still parsing through pages upon pag-
es of feedback and suggestions writ-
ten by the session’s attendees. 
“Hearing other people echo our 
ideas and even come up with new 
ones was really, really inspiring to 
see,” Ulloa said. 
The plan will only pertain to UF’s 
main campus, Williams said. It will 
be collaboratively funded by many 
departments on campus and around Gainesville, he added. 
Environmental sustainability is 
not included in the criteria that de-
termine a university’s rank, UF’s 
number one legislative priority. 
Still, UF Spokesperson Steve Or-
lando said it’s a top priority of the 
university.
“I have no reason to think other-
wise,” he said.
According to the 2020 Appro-
priations Project Bills database, only 
about 8 percent of this year’s re-
quested legislative funding contrib-
utes to environmental sustainability 
efforts.
Scheuer, the retired UF professor, 
is an avid runner. When she leaves 
her house in the morning, she’s 
sweating before she makes it to the 
end of the street. She returns with a 
headache.
“It’s like running in a sauna,” she 
said. “It’s only going to get worse.”
Still, Scheuer said she can handle 
the heat. It’s her neighbors she’s 
concerned about, the ones who can’t 
afford air conditioning. It’s the farm-
ers who work outside and grow her 
produce for a living.
“I’m not worried about me,” she 
said. “I’m worried about the people 
who have no escape.”
@haphillips96
hphillips@alligator.orgUF revising its 2009 Climate Action Plan
amounts of data to tackle complicated problems.”
He said multiple colleges will be able to recruit and 
retain accomplished faculty by offering them advanced 
facilities and the opportunity to join forces with other top 
researchers.
This building will cost $135 million, according to Hill.
He said the university is looking at improving the path-
way between Garage 14 and the new building.
“We are looking at landscaping and adding shade (to 
the path),” he said.
The new place to park for orange decal holders is Ga-
rage 14, which opened Feb. 3, located on Gale Lemerand 
Drive, farther from the center of campus. The seven-story 
garage cost $32 million and has more than 2,000 spaces, according to UF TAPS.
Levels one and two have 468 orange spaces, and lev-
els three through five have 917 spaces shared between 
orange and blue faculty decals.
No other parking will be added to replace the loss of 
parking at the surface lot because of the abundance of 
parking currently at Garage 14.
Hill said that doesn’t mean the university is done add-
ing parking structures.
“One of the possibilities is the surface lot next to Nor-
man Field will be replaced by a new parking garage con-
nected to the existing garage,” he said. “Another location 
could be a new garage on Museum Road just south of 
Beaty Towers.”

he did,” said Gainesville Police 
Department spokesperson Jorge 
Campos. 
As of Sunday evening, Turner 
is still employed at UF and his 
employment status is under re-
view, said UF spokesperson Steve 
Orlando. As of now, he’s prohib-
ited from being on campus. 
He admitted to authorities 
Thursday he was the owner of 
the Discord account, adding that 
no one else has access to his cell 
phone, which he used for the app, 
according to the report. 
After being read his Miranda 
rights, he said he found the imag-
es himself on Discord and knew 
they were of children, according 
to the report. Turner told police the photos were not his “normal 
preference” but said he was sexu-
ally aroused by them.
As of Friday afternoon, the 
underage children in the photos 
have not been identified by GPD, 
Campos said.
More than 100 tips regarding 
child pornography are submit-
ted each year for the North Cen-
tral Florida area, which includes 
Gainesville tips. 
“Just because we don’t hear 
of it all the time, doesn’t mean 
it’s not going on,” Campos said, 
adding that due to the nature of 
the crime, it’s often committed in 
private.
Tips that are not solved are 
kept in a criminal intelligence 
database for later investigation, 
Campos said. Encryption devices 
and services that block legal ac-cess to possible evidence and 
leads can sometimes complicate 
these investigations.
“Those things really hinder or 
prohibit us from identifying a sus-
pect and, in some cases, victims,” 
Campos said.
Authorities are working to 
minimize the impact on potential 
victims, as well as protecting ex-
isting victims from having their 
photos circulated by investigating 
these tips, according to Campos.  
Turner was released Saturday 
at 1:22 a.m. after he was held in 
the Alachua County Jail on three 
felony counts of promotion of 
sexual performance by a child. 
His bond was $75,000.

THE PARK COST $950,000 
AND WAS FUNDED BY THE 
HALF-CENT SALES TAX
By AJ Bafer
Alligator Contributing Writer
As the 208th U.S. Army Band played 
the national anthem on their brass in-
struments and drums Saturday morning, 
Gainesville community members, from 
children to veterans, silently stood to 
pay their respects at the newly opened 
Reserve Park.
More than 100 people came out to cel-
ebrate the grand opening of the park, lo-
cated across from East End Eatery at 700 
NE 11th St. The park pays tribute to the 
U.S. Army Reserve soldiers who trained 
at the site, said Elizabeth Waite, direc-
tor of Gainesville Wild Spaces and Public 
Places. 
The park’s site was a U.S. Army Re-
serve Center for the 257th movement 
control battalion, known as the Movers 
and Shakers, who occupied the space for 
more than 50 years before relocating in 2009. 
The space has since been inhabited 
by protective gear company Phalanx De-
fense Systems who facilitated the park’s 
creation by offering the abandoned space 
at the community’s request, Waite said.
“The site is rich with history,” she 
said. “It’s been a long time in the mak-
ing, and we’re very proud to open up a 
new neighborhood park.”
Waite said the park had been in devel-
opment for nearly seven years and cost 
$950,000 with the majority of funding 
coming from a half-cent sales tax passed 
in 2016 to support parks and recreation 
in Alachua County. 
Waite said the city commission ﬁ  rst 
initiated funding for the project before 
Wild Spaces and Public Places began in 
2017 and paid for the planting of 100 
trees to ﬁ  ll the park’s space.
Reserve Park caters to all ages and 
features a community garden, a swing set 
and a playground, Waite said. It also has 
an eagle sculpture made with recycled 
shipping containers and beer kegs and an 
obstacle course that symbolizes the site’s 
military history. Waite said park ofﬁ  cials are looking 
for anyone with information or photos 
related to the history of the location to 
display on a board at the park’s entrance 
to make it as personalized as possible.
The ceremony ended with applause as 
the Shahboz family, Gainesville residents 
who competed on the television program 
“American Ninja Warrior,” cleared the 
obstacle course.
Retired veteran Walter Jackson, who 
served 27 years in the U.S. Army Re-
serve, said the park’s site was his train-
ing area when he joined in 1978. He said 
he felt bad when he passed by the over-
grown ﬁ  eld when it was unoccupied, re-
membering it as a place he trained and 
ate lunch. 
Jackson said he has been in support 
of plans for the park since they were 
ﬁ  rst announced a few years ago. He said 
he was surprised by the opening’s large 
turnout, and he never expected anything 
like Reserve Park to ﬁ  ll the space he once 
trained in.
“To see it as a park and looking nice 
now, I love it,” Jackson said. “(This is) 
the best thing the city could’ve done.” New Reserve Park celebrates opening

The Sunshine State isn’t so 
great — at least, that’s what 
a Colorado business group 
wants Gainesville residents to 
think.
Sixteen newspapers in 
Florida featured an advertise-
ment meant to appeal to the 
LGBTQ+ community. 
“Move to Colorado. In 
Colorado, more than just our 
grass is protected. Your job is, 
too. We pride ourselves on our 
innovative businesses & abil-
ity to be ourselves at work,” 
the advertisement note stated 
with a rainbow displayed over 
mountains.
Florida has no comprehen-
sive LGBTQ+ human rights 
protections compared to Colo-
rado, and this is why the ad 
was published in Florida, said 
Jimmy Midyette, a staff at-
torney at the American Civil 
Liberties Union of Florida. The 
Florida Competitive Workforce 
Act is a legislative attempt to 
add protections for the LG-
BTQ+ community, but it has 
yet to be passed this year be-
cause Florida House Speaker 
José Oliva does not consider it 
a priority, Midyette said. 
The ad is meant to bring 
skilled workers, especially 
young college graduates, into 
Colorado’s workforce and to 
entice business owners and 
job creators to move there, 
said Debra Brown, executive 
director of Good Business Col-
orado. She said the company 
hopes this would contribute to 
Colorado’s creative economy 
and help the state become the 
“next Silicon Valley.”
“We will welcome them 
with open arms as they are, be-cause we know talent comes in 
all different shapes and sizes,” 
Brown said. “All are welcome 
here in Colorado.”
In attracting these individu-
als, Colorado’s protections of 
LGBTQ+ communities have 
a clear competitive advantage 
over Florida, with Colorado 
having a wider range from 
public accommodations to pa-
rental rights, Brown said.
The Alligator featured this 
ad in its paper last Monday 
after Good Business Colorado 
paid more than $2,000 for it. 
The ad was ﬁ  rst put in Florida 
newspapers a couple weeks 
ago, and how long it runs will 
depend on the reaction it gets 
and whether or not it gains 
traction, she said. 
Carter Erickson, a 19-year-
old UF electrical engineering 
freshman, is a transgender 
man who identiﬁ  es as pansex-
ual and said his rights have not 
been limited in his experience. 
He said his transition even be-
gan with hormones provided 
by UF.
“People are really accept-
ing,” Erickson said. “I have 
been more than grateful to be 
with my own chosen family up 
here.”
He said while those he has 
worked with have been accept-
ing of his identity, he has heard 
of others in the LGBTQ+ com-
munity being discriminated 
against professionally. 
About 60 percent of Florid-
ians are covered by LGBTQ+ 
protections because they live 
in a city or county that has 
passed a local version of the 
act, including Gainesville and 
Alachua County, Midyette 
said. 
“It’s important because 
we want the whole state. We want everyone to be covered,” 
Midyette said.
The Florida House Speaker 
is not in favor of the act be-
cause identifying someone 
as LGBTQ+ includes asking 
them or patrolling their social 
media, which doing so is dis-
criminatory, said Fred Piccolo, 
the communications director 
for Oliva.
“You don’t want people 
asking someone as they’re 
being hired: ‘Are you LGBTQ 
or not?’ because then you’re 
looking at someone discrimi-
nating in hiring by asking the 
question,” he said.
Piccolo said sexual orienta-
tion cannot be treated the same 
way as race or gender, which 
are more outwardly apparent. 
He said Oliva believes employ-
ers should not have the right 
to ask someone’s sexual orien-
tation, and he vehemently op-
poses discrimination based on 
that or gender identity. 
The Alligator reached out 
to the president of UF’s Pride 
Student Union, Georges Obayi, 
through three phone calls and 
two emails and was notiﬁ  ed 
Sunday morning the student 
organization did not want to 
comment on the topic. 
Oliva would recognize the 
advertisement as part of the 
free market, and if Good Busi-
ness Colorado feels the ad is 
a competitive advantage for 
them, they are welcome to use 
it, Piccolo said.
“We think that Florida’s a 
pretty great place to live, work 
and raise a family,” he said. 
“We’ll put our environment, 
both personal, competitive and 
business-wise, up against Col-
orado’s any day of the week.”Colorado group tries to draw Floridians with LGBTQ+ advertisement

Students and food service work-
ers are disappointed in UF’s Presi-
dent Kent Fuchs.
Nearly 50 people rallied in front 
of Fuchs’ office Friday to pro-
test working conditions and wage 
problems from Aramark, the food 
service company that provides ser-vices on campus.
Speakers included Aramark 
employees, members of Graduate 
Students United, the Young Demo-
cratic Socialists Association, United 
Faculty of Florida, the Alachua 
County Labor Coalition and the 
North Central Florida’s American 
Federation of Labor and Congress 
of Industrial Organizations, said 
Ashley Nguyen, a 22-year-old UF international studies and political 
science senior.
“Aramark workers at UF should 
know that there will be support for 
them, and that there are people 
that are willing to work with them 
to fight for their own rights,” Nguy-
en, the chair of Young Democratic 
Socialists Association, said.
The employees are experiencing 
hostile work environments with 
managers cursing out their work-
ers, said Jeremiah Tattersall, a UF 
alumnus and a field representative 
for North Central Florida’s Ameri-
can Federation of Labor and Con-
gress of Industrial Organization. 
He said some workers have 
complained that their employers 
aren’t paying them for their over-
time hours, despite constantly re-
minding them.
Nguyen said she emailed Fuchs 
to discuss their mission for a liv-
ing wage of $15 an hour for food 
service workers and the right for 
all UF employees and contracted 
workers to unionize, but he de-
clined without specifying a reason. 
She also emailed him to speak at 
the rally.
“It would not be appropriate for 
me to meet with the Alachua Coun-
ty Labor Coalition,” Fuchs wrote in 
the email.
The U.S. Department of Labor 
requires workers who work over-time, more than 40 hours a week, 
must be paid their time and a half. 
Tattersall, 33, said he files these 
complaints from Aramark employ-
ees to the department and is disap-
pointed in Fuchs.
“I just want UF to do better and 
treat their workers better,” he said. “There’s no excuse for President 
Fuchs not to meet with students 
who are concerned about work-
ing conditions of his food service 
workers.”

SPAY AND NEUTERING 
PROCEDURES ARE AVAILABLE 
By Allessandra Inzinna
Alligator Staff Writer
Florida Animal Friend is helping 
fund spaying and neutering 
procedures for pets, and it wants 
students to know the service is 
available in Gainesville. 
Florida Animal Friend donated 
$14,800 in August to St. Francis Pet 
Care Clinic so low-income pet owners 
can spay or neuter their cats or dogs 
for no cost. The donation covers 
224 surgeries, and 72 have been 
completed since veterinarians began 
conducting surgeries in November, 
said Priscilla Caplan, a volunteer and 
a former secretary of the St. Francis 
Pet Care board.
St. Francis Pet Care Clinic is part 
of the St. Francis House, located at 
413 S. Main St. The clinic offers basic 
veterinary care for the cats and dogs 
of low-income families, said Joanne 
Lopez, member of the St. Francis Pet 
Care board of directors. 
All clients who reside in Alachua 
County, homeless or not, must 
produce proof of low-income status, 
such as food stamps, low-income 
housing or supplemental social 
security income. 
“We really believe in keeping pets 
and their people together,” Lopez said.
Spay and neutering procedures 
usually cost families several hundred 
dollars, Lopez said. Although the 
clinic has other functions besides 
neutering and spaying cats and dogs, 
this grant is specifically for that. 
Lois Kostroski, the executive 
director for Florida Animal Friend, 
said unwanted pets either end up 
euthanized or left in shelters with a 
poor quality of life.
“If then we can provide spaying 
and neutering to prevent all of those 
additional births, then we’ve done a 
great thing for everyone, actually,” 
Kostroski said.
Approximately 19 million pets are 
living in poverty across America, 
according to data from American 
University. Forty percent of low-
income families who give up their 
pets would keep them if they had 
access to affordable veterinary care, 
according to a 2015 study by the 
American Society for the Prevention 
of Cruelty to Animals, one of the 
largest humane societies in the world.
“There’s no reason that somebody 
of inadequate means can’t have a pet 
to fulfill their life,” Lopez said. “A lot 
of the clients wouldn’t wake up in the 
morning if they didn’t have an animal 
to take care of.”

Students can say goodbye to hours of 
folding laundry with a new app that does 
all the work instead. 
UF masters graduate Kyle Lampkin cre-
ated Laundr with an alumnus from the 
University of Central Florida. The app pro-
vides laundry services in Gainesville and 
Orlando. 
A customer can order laundry to be 
picked up by a driver with a company’s 
laundry bag to take the user’s clothes and 
wash them, said Lampkin, a 24-year-old UF 
international business student. The clothes 
are returned cleaned, dried and folded 
within four hours or less.
Laundr has three options for subscrip-
tion plans: minimalist, active and social-
ite. The minimalist pays $10 a week for 
40 pounds of laundry a month. An activist 
pays $15 a week for 60 pounds and a so-
cialite pays $20 a week for 80 pounds.
If a user doesn’t have a membership, 
costs are determined by the laundry’s 
weight. The service costs around 80 cents 
per pound, Lampkin said. Specific delivery 
fees are determined by how far away the 
pickup is for the driver. 
Drivers wash the clothes at a partnered 
laundromat or by using their own laundry 
machine. Tips can be paid through the app.Users can submit specific requests for 
their laundry, such as hanging shirts, sepa-
rating colors, using hypoallergenic deter-
gent, adding long-lasting scents and using 
personalized laundry bags. The most com-
mon requests are to not dry bras or bath-
ing suits, said Michael Behfar, a 24-year-
old UCF alumnus and Lampkin’s business 
partner. 
The communal laundry machines in Enes 
Grahovac’s apartment, The Wynwood, are 
unreliable or filled with pet hair, he said.  
“I found myself spending five hours 
dedicated to waiting for laundry, so I tried 
Laundr to see if they would take that pro-
cess off my schedule, and they do a great 
job at it,” said Grahovac, a 22-year-old UF 
physics junior.
Since September, the company has nine 
paid employees in their office at Infinity 
Hall. Laundr expanded to Orlando Jan. 12.
“In the beginning, things were done 
completely haphazardly,” Behfar said, 
“Now, we are already through our first 
round of capital and already in our second 
location.”
Lampkin said he is happy to have seen 
the growth of the app from when he helped 
start it to where it is now.
“Although the idea may seem strange to 
people at first, we were encouraged by this 
and I think it really paid off for us,” Lamp-
kin said. Pet care clinic offers free services A laundry service for college students?

MORE THAN 300 PEOPLE 
WERE CERTIFIED
By Alexa Mickler
Alligator Contributing Writer
Clay Gibbons is training students and 
residents to try to save lives.
The owner of GatorCPR said he certi-
fied a woman who saw a hit-and-run a 
week after her training. She performed 
CPR on the victim so she could go to 
the hospital. The parents said they were 
grateful the victim didn’t die on the 
street. 
Gibbons partnered with Gatorsavers, 
a UF student organization that increases 
CPR training on campus, for two ses-
sions Saturday for people to get CPR cer-
tified or renew their certification for $5. 
Three-hundred eighty people attended 
the event.
GatorCPR is an organization that 
trains and certifies people in CPR, first 
aid, basic life support and advanced car-
diovascular life support. 
Gibbons said the goal of this event is 
to bring awareness and educate people 
who have never been trained. The usual 
cost for training is about $45, he said. 
“Hearing stories about the impact 
people have had by taking action has 
made a difference in how I teach,” Gib-bons said. “I don’t cut corners and make 
sure people leave confident with their 
skills.”
Both sessions were open to the pub-
lic, and those who attended a session 
will be certified for two years, Gibbons 
said. 
CPR is an acronym for cardiopulmo-
nary resuscitation, and nearly 45 percent 
of national out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 
victims are saved because bystanders 
knew how to do CPR, according to 2014 
data from the American Heart Associa-
tion.
Erika Jensen, 22, has volunteered 
as an instructor for two years. The UF 
chemical engineering senior said she 
wants people to be prepared when 
someone’s life is at risk. 
“It’s a stepping stone, something that 
everyone should know and be conscious 
of,” she said.
Khaai Nguyen, a 21-year-old UF biol-
ogy senior, said this event was her first 
time in CPR training, and the low cost 
for certification was a big factor regard-
ing why she went.
“Now I realize how important it is to 
take initiative when someone’s life is on 
the line,” Nguyen said.
Gatorsavers and GatorCPR paid 
about $1,800 for the event, and the rev-
enues from it will fund an AED machine to be donated to a non-profit organiza-
tion, which is still being decided on. An 
AED, which stands for automated exter-
nal defibrillator, is a machine that de-
tects irregular heart rhythms.  
GatorCPR has been involved with 
this event since 2012 and has certified 
4,500 people since then. It will have 
the next CPR certification training next 
January. 
“If I can put another person out there 
in the community who knows CPR, we 
will hopefully have more success stories 
of people doing something rather than 
nothing,” Gibbons said.Hundreds of students and Gainesville residents CPR certified

THE LEFT-HANDED 
PITCHER IS A BUSINESS 
ADMINISTRATION 
FRESHMAN
By Lexi Ashby 
Alligator Contributing writer
As people around the world cross 
out May 31 on their calendars, young 
baseball players cross their fingers. 
The month draws the men to the edge 
of their seats and glues phones to their 
hands as they anxiously await a call 
that could change their life forever — 
the call from Major League Baseball 
teams drafting the newest dynasty of 
young baseball stars.
Hunter Barco, a 19-year-old UF 
business administration freshman, was 
set to become one of those stars. He 
had finally ended the chase and caught 
up to his 8-year-old self’s dream when 
he was chosen in the Major League 
Baseball draft.
He turned the offer down.
Barco had always wanted to be a 
professional baseball player. Since the 
beginning of high school, he saw col-
lege as a backup plan. He dreamed 
of hearing his name called in the first 
round of the draft to join the select 
group of baseball players who go pro-
fessional straight out of high school.
Like most other baseball players, 
Barco started young: first in T-ball, 
then moving on to the challenge of hit-
ting a moving target. However, it was 
not until his summer going into fresh-
man year at The Bolles School in Jack-
sonville that he realized he was good 
at the sport. 
Really good.
He committed to the University of 
Virginia when he was 14. As time went 
by, his love for warm weather grew 
and he decided Virginia was not in his 
preferred latitude.The Summer going into his senior 
year of high school, he decided that 
UF, located just over an hour away 
from his hometown of Jacksonville, 
was the place for him — if he did not 
go to the MLB.
As a prerequisite for going into the 
draft, Barco had to get an MRI to en-
sure all ligaments and muscles were 
working smoothly. Upon examina-
tion of the results, the radiologist pro-
nounced his teres minor — a muscle in 
the shoulder — completely torn. The 
reading caught Barco off guard, as he 
had only been feeling slight soreness in 
his shoulder.
After that, Barco shut down. He was 
convinced the tear meant he needed to 
take some time off to allow his shoul-
der to heal. Press immediately caught 
wind of the injury and broke the news 
to the public. The No. 1 left-handed 
pitcher of the 2019 class was hurt. 
It was not until Barco received a 
second opinion on the MRI that he dis-
covered his teres minor was, in fact, 
not torn. However, the damage had 
already been done. The press knew 
about the injury, and those in the base-
ball world were predicting a drop in 
his draft stock, where analysts believe 
players will end up in the draft.
Barco was always seen as a back-
of-the-first-round player by those in 
the baseball industry.
They were right.
In a phone call he received in June, 
the Milwaukee Brewers drafted Barco, 
offering him a multi-million dollar 
signing bonus to join their team. How-
ever, the large sum of money thrown 
at Barco wasn’t enough to convince 
him to forgo four years at UF.
The minimum amount of money 
he would accept to sign with the team 
was $3 million.  Barco said this price 
was a sum of all the grueling practices 
and long hours he spent pushing to get 
just a little bit better.When the offer fell short, he was 
missing out on more than just money; 
he was missing out on acknowledg-
ment of his long-time dedication to 
improvement. Not to mention the $3 
million had to carry him through seven 
seasons as a minor league player — a 
time where his salary would be little 
more than scraps.
“After that, I told my agent to take 
me out of the draft. I said, ‘No one is 
going to pay $3 million at this point. 
I’m just going to go to school,’” said 
Barco.
Disappointment struck but was 
quickly washed away when a wave of 
excitement for his newfound college 
years settled in.
Barco hopes to make it to the Col-
lege World Series three times in his ca-
reer as a pitcher at Florida. He believes 
the team will make it further than it 
did last year, as the young team has 
more experience this year coupled 
with a new freshman class.
Junior pitcher Tommy Mace also 
anticipates more success for the Gators 
this year partly due to the arrival of 
such a strong freshman class.
“Hunter’s arrival to the team will 
definitely up the competition for the 
mound,” he said. “There are so many 
great pitchers in the freshman class 
that competition is tight and every-
one’s fighting to try to earn a spot.”
Barco’s dreams of becoming a 
professional baseball player have not 
disappeared. He is currently studying 
business administration but has his 
mind set on playing baseball for as 
long as time will permit.
As for his shoulder injury, he has 
completely recovered and has been 
going strong since arriving at Florida. 
Barco is attacking the 2020 season 
head-on and is nothing but ecstatic for 
the first spring season of his collegiate 
career.Meet Hunter Barco: Former MLB recruit, now a UF pitcher

SOFTBALL
By Graham Marsh
Sports Writer
The Gators proved their top-10 ranking 
with multiple wins over ranked teams this 
past weekend.
Florida defeated Nebraska 6-3 on Sun-
day at the Mary Nutter Collegiate Classic 
in Cathedral City, California. That win con-
cluded a weekend for the Gators in which 
they went 4-1 on the west coast. In all like-
lihood, now-No. 7 UF will climb into the 
top-ﬁ  ve in the USA Today/NFCA Coaches 
Poll after an excellent weekend, highlight-
ed by forcing No.1 UCLA to extra innings 
late Saturday night. 
Florida’s pitching staff showed consis-
tency all weekend. Despite working with 
a four-person rotation in the circle (Danni 
Farley did not appear in any of Florida’s 
ﬁ  ve games this weekend), the Gators all 
performed comparably, conceding just 14 
runs through ﬁ  ve games. On Sunday, the pitching load was large-
ly shouldered by junior Natalie Lugo. 
She threw just over six innings, starting 
the ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve before senior Katie Chronister 
relieved her in the sixth. Lugo re-entered 
the circle in the ﬁ  nal inning to end the 
game and the tournament for Florida. It 
was enough to limit the Cornhuskers to 
three runs on the afternoon while her of-
fense scored six. UF’s runs came off an RBI 
from senior Kendyl Lindaman, two from 
sophomore Charla Echols, two from senior 
Jordan Roberts and one from freshman Ju-
lia Cottrill.
The efforts against the Bruins on Sat-
urday came from the arms of Chronister, 
sophomore Elizabeth Hightower and fresh-
man Rylee Trlicek. Chronister and Hight-
ower only combined for a little over two 
innings of work. However, Trlicek carried 
it the rest of the way. 
She conceded seven hits against UCLA 
but only allowed two of them to turn into 
runs. That ability to close kept the scoreline narrow for the Gators, forcing an eighth in-
ning against the nation’s top team. 
Offensively, UF was below its average to-
tal of just over six runs a game entering the 
weekend, but that is due to stiffer competi-
tion in the tournament. In the most recent 
poll, only one team that Florida had played 
all year (No. 8 Michigan) was ranked in 
the Top 25 heading into the weekend. But 
at the Mary Nutter Classic, four out of the 
ﬁ  ve teams coach Tim Walton’s group faced 
were ranked. Even against that stiff com-
petition and hitting being a huge issue last 
year, this year’s version of Florida softball 
averaged 3.5 runs per game this weekend. 
UF now gets its longest break since the 
start of the season, with ﬁ  ve days until it 
retakes the ﬁ  eld. The Gators will be back 
home Friday to face Louisiana Lafayette for 
their ﬁ  rst series of the year.

The odds of complet-
ing a perfect March 
Madness bracket are 
one in 2.4 trillion. A 
person has a better 
chance of becoming the Pres-
ident of the United States or 
being crushed to death by a 
vending machine.
However, when March 
rolls around this year, the 
chances of having a perfect bracket will 
be slimmer, and March Madness will be 
must-see television because of unprec-
edented parity.
College basketball needed parity to 
help the sport recover from the dark 
cloud that hangs following the FBI cor-
ruption scandal. 
In Oct. 2018, the FBI concluded a 
three-year probe focused on coaches 
being paid ten of thousands dollars to 
steer NBA-bound players toward sport 
agents, ﬁ  nancial advisers and apparel 
companies. 
The parity in college basketball we 
are witnessing this year is good for the 
sport.
In college basketball history, there 
has never been a season where we saw 
ﬁ  ve different No. 1 teams before New 
Year’s Day. 
The college basketball season kicked 
off with then-No. 2 Kentucky knocking 
off then-No. 1 Michigan State — who 
are now unranked — in the Champions 
Classic. After the Wildcats took over the 
top spot, it fell to Evansville at home.
The Wildcats were then replaced by 
Duke, and it proceeded to fall to Ste-
phen F. Austin in front of the Cameron 
Crazies. Next, Louisville climbed to No. 
1 and was defeated by Texas Tech. Fi-nally, Kansas ascended 
to the top spot and lost at 
Villanova.
On Saturday, now-No. 
1 Baylor was knocked off 
by No. 3 Kansas 64-61 at 
home.
This has been a 
theme all season where 
top 10 teams have come 
and gone like a revolving 
door.
And it’s refreshing to have more 
than a handful of teams dominating the 
college basketball landscape. It’s similar 
to what is happening in the NBA due to 
the lack of super teams.
The parity college basketball is see-
ing this season is unparallelled and not 
even the best teams are safe from it.
Kentucky coach John Calipari said 
normally he believes there are about 
eight teams who are capable of winning 
the national championship and about 
20 who could reach the Final Four.
“I tell you right now, there may 
be 25 teams that can win the national 
championship,” Calipari said on Jan. 
23 during an Southeastern coaches 
teleconference, according to Kentucky.
com. “There may be 60 or 70 teams that 
can get to a Final Four.”
There have been more upsets this 
season than in years past because the 
talent is spread out more evenly instead 
of the best players ﬂ  ocking to Kentucky, 
Duke, Michigan State, Kansas or North 
Carolina.

Stripped of his socks and 
shoes, Florida’s men’s swim-
ming coach Anthony Nesty stood 
on the pool deck in the James E. 
Martin Aquatics Center in Au-
burn, Alabama. 
As the confetti fell and his 
post-meet interview concluded, 
he stepped to the waters’ edge 
and made the celebratory plunge. 
For the eighth-consecutive 
year and the 41st time in school 
history, the No. 11 Florida men’s 
swimming team was crowned 
SEC Champions, leaving Texas 
A&M in its wake.
After hauling in 15 medals 
— ﬁ  ve gold, four silver and six 
bronze — the Gators amassed 
1,194 points, 218.5 more than the 
second-place Aggies.
Sophomore Kieran Smith, who 
was awarded the men’s Swimmer 
of the Meet recognition, lit up the 
competition for ﬁ  ve straight days. 
Smith snatched a medal in all but 
the ﬁ  nal day of competition.
And though Smith’s individual 
SEC titles in the 500 free and 400 
individual medley, and his contri-
butions in 800 free relay and 400 
medley had implications within 
the conference meet, his perfor-
mances sounded throughout the swimming world. 
Leading off Florida’s 800 free 
relay, Smith’s 200-yard split time 
of 1:30.11 was good enough for 
a SEC and UF record. Smith’s 
swim in the relay also stands as 
the fourth-fastest 200-yard swim 
in history.
In the 500 free, Smith touched 
the wall in 4.06.32, setting a new 
NCAA and American record. 
However, he wasn’t the only 
Florida swimmer to make his way 
into the record books. 
Sophomore Robert Finke post-
ed the fastest mile-swim in Ameri-
can history on the ﬁ  nal day of the 
meet. 
Erasing six seconds from the 
previously-held American record, 
Finke stroked through 1,650 yards 
in 14:12.08. 
“I am incredibly proud of our 
men,” Nesty said in a release. 
“This championship is extremely 
challenging physically due to the 
length of days in the competition 
itself.  Every team wants the prize 
and are equally hungry.”
Meanwhile, Florida’s No. 
7-ranked women’s team managed 
a runner-up ﬁ  nish for the second 
straight season. 
Battling to the wire, the Gators 
outscored the future-champion 
Tennessee Volunteers by 68 
points in the ﬁ  nal day of action. However, by the end of the meet, 
Florida remained just 28.5 points 
shy.
Florida sophomore Leah Bras-
well notched a third-place ﬁ  nish 
in the 1,650-yard free on Satur-
day with a 15:54.54, while junior 
diver Emma Whitner struck silver 
after her performance on the plat-
form. 
Senior Sherridon Dressel 
would also pick up one of the 
Gators’ combined seven medals 
in her performance in the 100 
back after posting a 50.64, good 
for a silver medal.
“It was truly a team effort with 
all 22 of our athletes contributing 
throughout the week,” Florida 
coach Jeff Poppell said. “No one 
really gave us a chance heading 
into the meet but our team be-
lieved we could win. We just ran 
out of gas a little this evening.”
Now, Florida’s swim squads 
turns its focus to the NCAA 
Championships. The women’s 
championships span March 18-
21 and March 25-28 for the men. 
The men will host a Last Chance 
Invitational at UF on Feb. 28-29. 
Meanwhile, the Gators’ divers 
will head to the NCAA Diving 
Zones March 9-11.

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

A major reason for Florida’s 
newfound success this season 
has been the on-court relation-
ship between guards Kiara Smith 
and Lavender Briggs.
The backcourt tandem has de-
veloped a strong rapport through 
27 games, but a misunderstand-
ing between the two in the clos-
ing seconds of Sunday night’s 
contest against Arkansas almost 
led to an undesired outcome for 
the Gators.
Briggs lined up in front of the 
scorer’s table and looked for an 
open teammate, as UF clung to a 
three-point lead with 1.5 seconds 
remaining in the fourth quarter. 
All Florida had to do was 
complete the inbounds pass out of the timeout and sink a pair of 
free throws to put the game out 
of reach, but Razorbacks guard 
Chelsea Dungee prevented that 
from happening. She blanketed 
Smith every step of the way and 
intercepted the ball after an er-
rant pass.
Dungee’s potential game-ty-
ing shot at the buzzer from near 
half court was off the mark, and 
Florida held on for an 83-80 vic-
tory over No. 22 Arkansas at the 
O’Connell Center. 
The Gators (15-12, 6-8 SEC) 
and Razorbacks (21-6, 9-5 SEC) 
met earlier this year in late Janu-
ary, but the result was signifi-
cantly different.
Arkansas came away with 
a 22-point win, while Smith re-
corded just 10 points, a rebound 
and an assist.This time around, the red-
shirt junior paced Florida with a 
career-high 26 points to go along 
with four rebounds and three as-
sists. Six of those points came in 
the final two-and-a-half minutes 
of the fourth to stymy Arkansas’ 
comeback attempt after being 
down by 14 in the first quarter.
Briggs dropped 20 points and 
shot 8 of 16 from the field, mark-
ing the first time since March 3 
of 2019 that UF had two players 
score 20 or more.
The Razorbacks, on the other 
hand, were led by guards Amber 
Ramirez and A’Tyanna Gaul-
den, each of whom registered 17 
points.
Gaulden was at the forefront 
of Arkansas’ second unit, one 
that allowed Arkansas to get 
back into the game after going down by as much as 14 in the 
opening quarter.
She accounted for more than 
half of her team’s bench points 
(33) and nearly matched the out-
put of Florida’s reserves (20).
The redshirt junior’s effort 
wasn’t enough, however, espe-
cially with the Gators outscor-
ing the Razorbacks 52-43 in the 
paint.
“We led most of the game, 
and even when they (Arkansas) 
came back, we didn’t flinch,” 
Newbauer said. “(We) just 
played with aggressiveness on 
every possession, even when 
we made mistakes or didn’t get 
stops...That was the difference in 
the game for us today.”

The situation was the same for the Gators almost ex-
actly a year ago Friday.
Last season, then-No. 3 Florida was undefeated in SEC 
play with two meets left in the regular season and were 
welcoming then-No. 7 Georgia on Feb. 22, 2019.
A win would have clinched the SEC regular season title.
But it didn’t happen.
UF lost to the Bulldogs 197.45-197.375 and suffered its 
only SEC loss of the season.
The SEC regular season title was clinched the following 
week against Arkansas, but the loss prevented the Gators 
from being the No. 1 seed in the 2019 SEC Tournament 
and lowered their seeding the NCAA Tournament.
This time around, things were different. No. 2 Florida 
hosted No. 8 Alabama on Friday night. A win would clinch 
the conference title. UF came out ready and outclassed the 
Crimson Tide, putting up its second highest score of the 
season in a 198.05-197.45 win.
Coach Jenny Rowland said following the win that a dif-
ferent approach was taken leading into this meet.
“We didn’t really talk about it last season,” she said. 
“This season, I laid it all out on the table, this is an op-portunity, what are we going to do with it?”
Despite being SEC regular season champs, the Gators 
(8-0, 6-0 SEC) face one of their biggest challenges of the 
season: Circumventing a meltdown in the final three meets 
of the 2020 season.
The first test will be this Friday night against No. 11 
Georgia, the same team that ruined their title hopes last 
season. 
This Georgia team (8-5, 2-3 SEC) isn’t as talented as 
the one that came into the O’Dome last season, but it did 
beat No. 12 Kentucky this week on the road and is jump-
ing at the opportunity to put a dent in its rival’s magical 
season again.
“We’ve all been to Georgia before and we know it’s an 
intense atmosphere there,” senior Amelia Hundley said. 
“But I think we’re ready for it, especially coming off of 
this.”
One gymnast who won’t lack motivation will be junior 
Alyssa Baumann, whose sister — Rachel — competes for 
the Bulldogs.
“I’m going to have a bunch of family there, and it’ll be 
really cool to watch her compete again and hopefully beat 
her again,” Baumann said.
A loss to the Bulldogs probably won’t change anything 
for seeding in the SEC Tournament, since Florida has a two-game lead on every other SEC school.
However, a loss to Georgia — or any other remaining 
opponents — could impact NCAA Tournament seeding.
After their visit to Athens, the Gators travel to State 
College, Pennsylvania, to take on Penn State on March 7.
There, Florida star Trinity Thomas is sure to have an 
entourage watching her. The sophomore is from York, 
Pennsylvania, a little over 100 miles from PSU’s campus.
UF will close the season against Texas Woman’s Uni-
versity at home on March 13.
That meet will be on senior night, where UF’s four se-
niors — Rachel Gowey, Sierra Alexander, Maegan Chant 
and Hundley — will be playing in their final home meet.
One thing working in the Gators’ favor is the Nittany 
Lions and Pioneers are not ranked in the Road to Nation-
als Top 25, their first opponents all season long not ranked 
at the time of their meet.
“It will be easy to get back into the gym on Sunday to 
prepare for our next opportunity,” Rowland said. “We are 
taking it day-by-day and trying to get better each day.”

LACROSSE

It was a slow and me-
thodical breakdown, Saturday 
against Loyola Maryland. 
In the past two weeks, 
Florida would have answers 
to each of their opponents’ 
scores, but the No. 3 Gators 
couldn’t outpace the No. 10 
Greyhounds. 
Like with its first two 
games, UF (2-1) conceded the 
first goal. But it wasn’t until 
nearly five minutes in, down 
2-0, that Shannon Kavanagh 
responded, scoring her 13th 
goal of the season. Less than a 
minute later, the Greyhounds’ 
Sam Fiedler got her fifth this 
year. Twice more the two 
teams traded blows, but back-
to-back Elli Kluegel scores 
opened the tap for Loyola.It wasn’t quick, as it took 
three minutes for the Grey-
hounds (3-0) to push their lead 
from two to five points. When 
progressing on offense, ball 
carriers methodically found 
an open player, taking extra 
time to find the one Florida de-
fender who missed a read. Off 
the ball, attackers repeatedly 
found ways to cut toward the 
crease, creating multiple op-
tions to score. 
And if each goal applied 
pressure, Florida’s 26 fouls 
catalyzed their frustrations. 
Frustration led to forced pass-
es, in the hopes that a connec-
tion through a tight window 
would salvage the game. That 
frustration spread throughout 
the UF fans in attendance like 
a virus, leading to vocal out-
cries each time a warranted 
call was missed or a Gator was 
booked. Florida had the same 
amount of fouls against Mary-
land — they had half against 
Colorado. 
Coach Amanda O’Leary is 
aware of the team’s propensity 
to commit fouls, and it’s some-
thing she wants to work on. 
That includes emphasizing the 
team’s ability to drive to the 
goal; her effort to reduce scor-
ing lapses and ease the pres-
sure off midfielders Kavanagh 
and Brianna Harris, who have 
combined for 24 goals this sea-
son. 
Kavanagh, with her two 
goals and nine draw controls, 
didn’t wilt under pressure, but 
the team suffered omit lapses 
of production that resulted in 
allowing six unanswered goals 
following halftime. 
For its effort, the team did 
not stop trying to take the game 
back, Harris’ second goal with 58 seconds left illustrated their 
desire to cling to hope. But the 
mistakes they made early cre-
ated an insurmountable wall 
to climb.
With a mid-week game 
against 0-3 Towson, Florida 
has an opportunity to iron 
out its flaws. For casual fans, 
what appears to be a meaning-
less game could prove to be 
important for a young team 
that’s still experiencing grow-
ing pains. 
“Everybody needs to be 
confident enough to go to 
the goal cage,” O’Leary said. 
“(There are) A lot of games 
left. That’s a huge benefit. It 
gives us an opportunity to look 
at the deficiencies we had to-
day.”

Florida nearly punched its 
ticket to the NCAA Tournament 
for the fourth-straight year on 
Saturday at Kentucky.
The opportunity was there for 
the Gators to add a signature road 
win to their resume, ease their 
nerves on Selection Sunday and 
win their fourth game in a row. 
But UF came up short against 
Kentucky, which maintained their 
position atop the SEC with a 65-
59 win.
Forward Keyontae Johnson 
continued the tear he’s been on 
with a near double-double effort 
against UK. The sophomore put 
up 19 points and nine rebounds 
in the loss. Johnson is averaging 
16.4 points and 8.4 rebounds per 
game in February on a scorching 
54 percent shooting clip.
Kerry Blackshear Jr. turned in 
his best performance since the 
win against Auburn on Jan. 18. 
He scored 18 points, his highest 
total in seven weeks, and grabbed six boards.
The problem for Florida 
was that its other three starters 
combined for just six points.
The backcourt duo of Noah 
Locke and Andrew Nembhard 
faltered at the worst possible time 
for the Gators. Locke had hit 14 
threes on 22 tries in his previous 
three games but went 0 for 5 in 
Lexington, Kentucky. He ﬁ  nished 
with zeroes across the box score 
aside from two fouls and a 
turnover in 23 minutes of play.
Nembhard didn’t fare much 
better in the scoring department, 
ﬁ  nishing with just four points, 
his second-lowest output of the 
season. He did, however, notch 
six rebounds and six assists.
Tre Mann was the beneﬁ  ciary 
of Locke’s off night, matching his 
career-high with 13 points in 29 
minutes of play. The freshman 
guard provided the outside 
shooting spark that was missing 
from the UF offense by connecting 
on a trio of three-pointers.
In the end, Immanuel Quickley’s career night proved 
to be too much for Florida to 
overcome. The loss to Kentucky 
continued the Gators’ road 
struggles this season as UF fell to 
3-6 on the road.
There are two remaining road 
games on the schedule for Florida: 
a matchup Saturday at Tennessee 
and a March 4 bout at Georgia.
At home, the Gators play 
LSU on Wednesday night and 
Kentucky on March 7 to close the 
regular season. UF lost to both 
teams on the road by a combined 
eight points.
ESPN’s latest Bracketology 
from Feb. 21 has Florida 
projected as a No. 9 seed playing 
Illinois in the ﬁ  rst round. The 
Kentucky and LSU games present 
opportunities to improve on its 
potential seeding and both teams 
are currently ahead of the Gators 
in the SEC standings.

after his seven-hit weekend, two of which were extra base hits. 
man lefty once again, and the 
decision paid off.
Barco responded by strik-
ing out the next batter to 
retain Florida’s lead and he 
ﬂ  exed his muscles as he made 
his way into the dugout.
The freshman’s composure 
and conﬁ  dence on the mound 
in just his second career start 
helped the No. 2 Gators to 
a 5-3 victory over the No. 3 
Hurricanes. With UF (8-0) 
sweeping UM (4-3) over the 
weekend, it has now won 
each of the last six regular-
season series between the two 
programs, including 15 of the 
last 18 games.
“It’s great to have a great 
arm, but you still have to 
command your secondary 
pitches,” O’Sullivan said in a 
release. “I was really pleased 
he was able to ﬁ  nd that in the 
ﬁ  fth inning.”
Barco hurled 92 pitches 
against Miami. He faced 23 
batters and struck out seven, 
giving up only two hits and 
one earned run in 5.1 innings 
pitched.
“When he has his slider for 
strikes, with the fastball he 
has, and he’s got that change-
up that’s got some tumbling 
action, he’s really tough to 
hit,” O’Sullivan said. 
UM right-hander Slade Ce-
cconi wasn’t as solid as his counterpart.
The sophomore pitcher al-
lowed two runs and two hits 
in the opening inning and a 
solo homer to shortstop Josh 
Rivera at the top of the second 
to give the Gators an early 3-0 
advantage.
Center ﬁ  elder Jud Fabian 
homered off Cecconi, too.
His home run over the left-
ﬁ  eld wall in the ﬁ  fth inning 
was his third of the season, 
which leads the team. Fa-
bian was a combined 2 of 12 
from the plate against Miami 
throughout the weekend be-
fore his solo blast.
Cecconi was replaced 
in the following inning by 
freshman left-hander Carson 
Palmquist, who surprised 
some Florida batters with 
his slider and breaking ball 
throughout the game.
He ﬁ  nished the day with 
ﬁ  ve strikeouts and gave up 
zero hits or runs to the 10 UF 
batters that he faced.
The Hurricanes cut their 
deﬁ  cit to just one in the bot-
tom of the eighth following a 
two-run homer from Gil off 
Gators right-hander David Lu-
ethje, but Florida ultimately 
clung on to its lead, giving 
O’Sullivan his ﬁ  rst 8-0 start 
since coming to the program 
in 2008.
