� HE WAS LYING IN THE MIDDLE OF

  UF student Antonio Milanes Cuesta 
died Monday after a car ran over him while 
he was lying in the middle of a road. 
  It was 3:20 a.m. when 22-year-old Adam 
Rodriguez, of Oviedo, Fla., traveling east on McCulloch Road in Seminole County, did not see Cuesta, 19, lying in the center lane of the road and ran over him, accord-ing to a Florida Highway Patrol report. 
  The accident happened near the in-
tersection of McCulloch Road and Orion Boulevard.
  Cuesta was taken to Florida Hospital 
East, where he died. 
  A deputy had passed through the area 
between ﬁ  ve and 10 minutes before the in-cident but did not see Cuesta or anyone else lying in the road at the time, said Sgt. Kim Montes, FHP public information of-ﬁ  cer. 
  The FHP doesn’t know why Cuesta was 
lying in the road, Montes said. 
  It will probably take at least two weeks 
to get the results from the alcohol and drug tests performed during Cuesta’s au-topsy. 
  It is possible that Cuesta could have 
tripped and fell in the middle of the road, but there were no witnesses in the area to 
explain how he ended up lying there, Montes said. 
  The investigation is 
ongoing, but charges are not likely because of the circumstances of the inci-dent, she said. Rodriguez was not under the inﬂ  u-ence of alcohol or drugs 
at the time of the incident.  
  Cuesta was an electrical engineering 
sophomore and a member of ROTC at UF, said friend and former roommate Kevin Weschler. He was also a member of the UF

  UF’s administration withdrew the pro-
posal for block tuition indeﬁ  nitely Tues-
day, postponing a measure that proved unpopular with many students.
  At a conference call of the UF Board of 
Trustees, UF Provost Joe Glover said the recent jump in graduation rates gave the administration reason to reconsider the measure.
  “I know of no other place that has 
undergone a 6 [percentage point] rise in graduation rate,” he said.
  For students who entered UF in 2006, 
the four-year graduation rate was 64 per-cent, a jump from 58 percent for students who entered in 2005.
  Machen said he’s never seen an in-
crease so drastic.
  “I’ve been in this game for 14 years 
— I’ve never seen that kind of jump,” he said.
  He said he felt Student Government handled its opposition to block tuition well, but the statistics are what cemented his stance to postpone the measure.
  UF Student Body President Ben Mey-
ers said he felt the increased rate is a result of students responding to tough economic times.
  “I want to assure you that the jump in 
the graduation rate shows a re-dedication of students in this economy ,” Meyers said.
  The administration wants to monitor 
the graduation rate to see if the increase is stable. Glover said UF examines gradu-ation rates every year, and that based on preliminary research, he thinks the cur-rent graduation rate will stay steady for the next cycle.  Administration postpones

  A family photo project is giv-
ing viewers a snapshot of UF’s 
campus in the mid-twentieth century. 
  Pam Marlin, a graduate pro-
gram assistant for the physics department, created the project, called “UF Then and Now.” 
  Marlin, 44, got the idea from 
another online project that showed World War II photos held over their contemporary locations. She decided to expand the concept to UF.
  A photo from the 1950s shows 
a boy on the corner of Southwest 13th Street and University Av-enue, where an information sign in the background welcomes vis-itors to the campus. The corner still exists today, but the entrance sign has been removed.
  “The landscaping has changed, and some of the buildings have changed, but the people haven’t changed,” Marlin said. 
  The photographs came from 
the UF Digital Collections, which hosts more than 300 documents, photographs and maps online. When deciding what UF images to include in her project, Marlin chose photos of locations with personal meaning. Those build-ings include Newell Hall, where she once worked, and University Auditorium, where she used to play with the jazz band in col-lege. 
  She also chose popular loca-
tions such as the Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium and the Reitz Union.
  “It was a family effort,” Marlin 
said. “My children are students here and they had some choices as well.”
  In total, there are 19 photo- Project provides

STUDENT LIFE
EMILY MORROW

August is a month of firsts — the first day 
of school, the first semester’s tuition pay-
ment, the first month’s rent deposit — all of which can add up.
Pre-med student Marlon Rodriguez had 
to take this into consideration when purchas-ing his genetics textbook.
Rather than paying $184 to purchase the 
textbook he needed this semester, Rodriguez opted to rent it for $138.
Renting textbooks has become increasing-
ly popular in college towns like Gainesville.
Follett Higher Education Group, the oper -
ator behind the UF Bookstore, has expanded its rental services from seven stores in 2009 to about 860 stores across the country, and it is continuing to grow.
Last year, students who rented books 
from the UF Bookstore saved about $550,000, according to a press release.
Follett spokesman Elio Distaola said the 
company doubled the number of books avail-able for rental from 2010 to 2011.
Not all textbooks are available to rent at 
the UF Bookstore — but the ones that are have been discounted by about 50 percent.
Renting textbooks is not new to 
Gainesville. The three Florida Bookstores have been offering students the option of renting since 2009.
All of their textbooks are eligible for rent, with discounts ranging between 15 percent and 55 percent depending on the book, text-book manager Mike Bibbee said.
Rodriguez said he isn’t so sure renting 
textbooks is the best option, though.
“I still think it’s economically better to 
buy your books,” he said. “You can usually sell them back for more than you’d save by renting.”
Follett is also offering completely digital 
forms of some textbooks for students looking to save some money. These books generally cost 40 to 60 percent less than the new book.
Available through the platform CafeScribe, 
Distaola said these e-books are much more interactive than the typical PDF e-book.
Students using the books are able to ex-
change any notes they made in the book, cre-ate a study sheet from any highlighted ma-terial, and get feedback and tips from their professors throughout the book.
“We want to build a bookstore of choic-
es,” Distaola said. “In today’s market, rental is still king, but we want to make sure we’re ready for when we reach the digital tipping point.”Textbook rentals on the rise

Slating for Student Senate positions 
closed Tuesday with 595 applicants for 
50 seats. 
Student Government Supervisor of 
Elections Toni Megna said the number was not a huge surprise.
“I think this election is going to be 
very competitive, and [the parties] were expecting a lot of people to come out,” she said. 
Each semester the Student Body 
elects 50 new senators.
Megna said she tallied 505 Unite 
Party candidates, 37 Students Party candidates, five independent candi-dates and 37 candidates who did not indicate a party preference. 
Candidates indicated if they were 
running under a political party on the sign-in sheet. 
As soon as they finished qualifying, 
candidates who ran under a party were interviewed by party members. 
Megna said Unite Party and Stu-
dents Party members choose 50 or few-er candidates to support. Final num-bers were not available at press time.
Students running independently do 
not undergo interviews.
Of the 50 senators to be elected this 
fall, one student will represent each of the 13 dorm areas, and 37 students will represent off-campus residential districts.
Student Body elections are sched-
uled for Sept. 27 and 28. 
Former Senate Minority Leader 
Jonathan Ossip sat at the Students Par -
ty table. He said the candidate turnout had been “pretty good” so far.
“The candidates have been extreme-
ly qualified,” he said.
Students were able to participate in 
qualifying and slating from 9 a.m. to 5 
p.m. Thursday,  Fri-day and Tuesday in the Reitz Union.
E x p l o r a t o r y 
freshman Kayla King interviewed for slating with the Unite Party. King said she was her high 
school’s senior class 
president, and she has been involved in SG since she was in fifth grade.
She learned about the Senate from 
Unite Party members advertising in the Reitz Union. King said her Delta Zeta sorority sisters explained the sys-tem and encouraged her to slate when she asked them about it.
King said she wanted to learn about 
how UF runs and who does what.
“I might as well just get involved 
and find out on my own,” she said.SG parties fill election slates

Despite a bleak economy and 
rising tuition costs, officials from 
the UF Office of Sorority and Fra-ternity Affairs have not seen a decline in the number of students who join Greek organizations.
This year, 1,262 women par -
ticipated in sorority recruitment. That’s about 90 more than last year, said Carey Mays, program coordinator for OSFA. 
The number of men who par -
ticipated in fraternity recruitment was not available by press time, according to Rajiv Asnani, UF In-terfraternity Council president. However, 819 men accepted frater -
nity bids this year, he said, which is about 40 more than last year.   Jack Causseaux, associate director for OSFA, said he didn’t think the economy had an impact on Greek turnout this year.
“We feared that, but our num-
bers have been increasing,” he said. 
The sum of average new mem-
ber fees and chapter dues for a so-rority and fraternity are $2,073 and $3,067, respectively.
The fraternities and sororities 
are urged to address their financial costs to new members, and most offer scholarships and payment plans, Causseaux said. Brandon Corsentino, a member 
of Chi Phi Fraternity, is applying for scholarships to help him afford his chapter dues. The fraternity’s alumni offer between $500 and $1,000 to nine members each se-mester. Scholarship recipients are chosen based on their academic re-cords and involvement within the fraternity.
“I had to apply for scholarships because my parents told me that if I wanted to be involved, I had to pay out of my own pocket,” Corsentino said. “I was concerned about the money.”
The high costs can be justi-
fied through the fraternity’s meal plan, said Corsentino, an indus-trial engineering sophomore.  Most sororities and fraternities provide their members with 10 to 15 meals per week at their houses. The costs for the meal plans are in-cluded in some chapter dues. 
Students with on-campus meal 
plans can switch to their chapter houses’ meal plans.
“It’s better food,” Corsentino 
said. “Our chef, Teddy, is pretty awesome.”
Briana Rittersporn, a tele-
communications sophomore, didn’t think the expense of join-ing a sorority was worth it.  
“I would have to go to all the so-cial events,” Rittersporn said. 
There are two other Greek or -
ganizations not affiliated with the Panhellenic Council and Interfra-ternity Council: the Multicultural Greek Council and the National Pan-Hellenic Council.
An official from the National 
Pan-Hellenic Council was not available to comment. 
Isamara Berrios, president of 
the Multicultural Greek Council, said her sorority has been affected by the economy.
“Everything that the chapter 
has done now has increased in price,” Berrios said. “The money has to come from our own pock-ets.”
The Multicultural Greek Coun-
cil has not seen a decline in recent recruitment figures, but students are concerned about the costs, Ber -
rios said. 
The sum of average new mem-
ber fees and chapter dues cost $547. 
Recruitment for the Multicul-
tural Greek Council begins Sept. 9. Students who want to learn more about sororities or fraternities can find information in the 2011 Guide to Florida Greeks, which is avail-able on the UF Greeks website, greeks.ufl.edu.
“People still want to get in-
volved,” Berrios said. “They just have to make more sacrifices.”4, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 2011

Passers-by may have noticed 
a non-native moose guarding 
Jenn Garrett’s front yard near Westside Park and Littlewood Elementary School. 
Environmentalists shouldn’t 
be concerned, though. 
The moose, which has re-
sided at 1004 NW 34th St. since May, is made of steel.  
Garrett, 33, a full-time artist, 
said she usually displays her own work in her yard, but since she loaned out or sold all of her finished pieces, she wanted to give students an opportunity to showcase their work. 
Working through a profes-
sor in UF’s fine arts depart-ment, Garrett found three steel sculptures she liked by three students. 
She chose two abstract pieces 
by Stephen Rudolph Lefebvre and Jon Burns, and the moose by Michael Bauman. All three sculptures are for 
sale.
“We’ve only gotten good 
feedback about it,” Garrett said.
It’s common for parents 
walking their children past the house to the elementary school to stop and comment on the sculptures, Garrett said. 
The moose gets the most 
compliments because it’s the most recognizable. 
“I think it’s so much fun,” 
she said. “I’ve enjoyed having [the moose]. And the others, too.” 
Garrett and her husband, 
Tim, an assistant professor in UF’s College of Medicine, moved into the house in 2006 after Garrett received her mas-ter’s degree in interior design and historic preservation at UF. She said she started putting 
her own metal sculptures in the yard right away and has had a total of eight or nine sculptures on display over the last five years. 
She moves the sculputures 
from UF to her yard because students don’t typically have a way to move the sculptures from campus to their home or storage.
“You can’t really take that 
moose back to your apartment,” she said. 
One of her pieces rests in the 
yard of its current owner — her neighbor.
When she finishes a new 
piece, she’ll park it on the lawn until someone buys it or it goes to exhibition. 
The neighbors miss the 
sculptures between displays. 
They came by to inquire 
about the emptiness of the yard before Garrett acquired the moose and its abstract counter -
parts, she said.

ing? Where’s all the art?’” Artist displays steel sculptures,

Joe Durando watched as people 
mingled around his vegetable stand 
— a girl cradling a white kitten while singing “Hound Dog” and a young couple holding hands nearby — on his first day back to the Union Street Farmers Market.
His stand holds wares that could 
be hard to find at a grocery store: purple and green eggplant, starfruit and chestnuts.
Durando’s romance with veg-
etables has been a growing rela-tionship. He spent his childhood in South Florida, where his parents raised racehorses.
He started gardening at 10 and 
got his first copy of Organic Garden-ing magazine in 1975.
A two-time UF alumnus, he got 
a bachelor’s and master’s degree in horticulture in the 1980s.
Now, he and his wife, Trace 
Giornelli, run the Possum Hollow Farm, 15 miles north of Gainesville, near Alachua. 
“I know the vegetables,” said 
Durando, who is in his 50s. “It’s my passion.”
He said they’ve owned the farm 
for about 20 years and sold at the farmers market for 15 years. They also sell to several Gainesville res-taurants.
Civilization, a downtown co-op 
restaurant that serves ethnic cuisine, offers lunch and dinner specials that feature Possum Hollow Farm fare.
John Prosser, a managing mem-
ber who chooses the restaurant’s produce, said Durando’s vegetables and herbs find their way into a cor -nucopia of vegetarian dishes such as pumpkin lasagna.
“I like the idea of supporting 
someone who lives here who I know here,” Prosser said. “They live here. They’re raising families here. They’re spending money here.”
He said he likes to spread out his 
business to several local farmers, but he said he’ll be back to Durando for more ingredients once the salad greens start rolling in.“Every year is a learning curve,” 
Durando said.
He said he loves coming to the 
farmers market because of the vi-brant atmosphere, great people and, of course, the local beer.Jenn Bennett pushed a stroller up 
to Durando’s stand. Her 18-month-old son, Atticus, looked up with a blue pacifier in his mouth.
“He’s starting to look like you,” 
Durando said to Bennett as they caught up on old times.
Bennett said she’s known Duran-
do for 12 years and has been buying vegetables and herbs from his stand for five years. 
She left with Asian eggplants.“It’s just such a great way to end 
the day ,” said Bennett, who works as an art teacher at the Professional Academies Magnet at Loften High School. “The vegetables that he has this season are very nice. I can’t wait for fall, though.”
The vegetables and herbs Duran-
do will start to sell in about a month are a knockout, he said.
He has three or four types of aru-
gula and rapini — more types than some people know exist.
He’ll have San Marzano toma-
toes, the Cadillac of tomatoes.
“Until you’ve actually experi-
enced it, there’s no way to really talk about it,” he said.
At home, his field is his pantry . 
He makes curry dishes with Asian eggplants and a cold bean salad in-spired from a restaurant dish he par -
ticularly liked.
To him, farming is about more 
than food. It’s about sustainability.
“In this day and age, from the 
global point of view from global health, how we feed our self is very important,” he said.

Graduate students may find their Student Senate 
seats cut in half after next week’s Senate meeting.
Senate Judiciary Chairman Jason Tiemeier pre-
sented the proposed Reapportionment for 2012, which 
changes the number of senators allotted for different areas.
The proposal would cut the number of graduate 
student Senate seats from 10 to five. Five of the seats are currently open.
Reapportionment also would drop the number of 
pharmacy school senators from two to one. The six open Senate seats for the spring would increase the representatives for Agriculture and Life Sciences from three to five, freshmen from three to five and sopho-mores from six to eight.
Fall elections are based on residence halls and off-
campus housing districts, and Spring elections are based on colleges.
Off-campus voting districts would also change with 
the proposal. 
Independent Sen. Carly Wilson said she was upset 
that senators would approve the Reapportionment without approval from the Judiciary Committee.Tiemeier, a member of the Unite Party, said although 
the Judiciary Committee usually reviews the Reappor -
tionment each year, there were not enough committee members at Sunday’s meeting to approve it. 
Tiemeier said Reapportionment is due two weeks 
before voting. Final approval will be voted on at the Senate meeting next week, which is two weeks before the first day of Student Body elections.
“We’re literally running out of time, so it had to be 
done,” he said. 
Wilson said Unite Party members  decreased seats 
in areas usually held by independent senators to give their party members more seats.
Student Body Supreme Court Chief Justice Matt 
Michel said he wants graduate students to be involved, but he agreed that some cuts may be necessary.
He pointed out that graduate students are already 
functioning with only five senators representing them.
“We’re not even halfway through the term of peo-
ple who were elected in the spring,” he said.Senators propose seat reallocations

Plagiarism pandemic 
hurts education
“Plagiarism is bad.”
That’s what we have all been told since high 
school. 
“Who cares if we copy the works of others?”
“They wouldn’t have put it out there if they didn’t want 
other people to use it, right?” 
“It’s not like I’m using all of their work — just a few sen-
tences.“
“I’m just taking what everyone else has done and making 
something new, aren’t I?” 
Many of you might have felt these sentiments while you 
were struggling to find the right citation style to use in your last research paper. 
Surely plagiarism is not that big of a deal is it? In a recent Pew Research Center study that polled 1,055 
college and university presidents from all over the country, 55 percent said that plagiarism in papers among college students had increased over the past 10 years. 
Of those presidents, 89 percent “believed that computers 
and the Internet have played a major role in this trend.”
Copy and paste is not your friend. It can be tempting to copy and paste material you find on-
line into your research paper, but this is a one-way ticket to academic disciplinary action. 
But moral behavior should never be commanded, and it 
should never be elicited by threat of punishment. Morality does not exist at the barrel of a gun. 
Instead, you should not plagiarize because it is the right 
thing to do. 
Your research papers might be completed the night before 
they are due, but the sources you used took years to complete. 
If you believe that the person or publication that took the 
time and effort to compile and develop the information and ideas off of which you based your work does not require a cita-tion, then you are essentially implying that the source does not deserve credit for this effort.  
By that logic, you are implying that you do not deserve 
credit for your own work. Therefore, you deserve nothing but failure on your project. 
There is, however, another reason that might hit closer to 
home.
If you do not cite your sources, you will lose all credibility 
for yourself and your findings. 
Yes, you are in college and are probably pretty smart. But 
you will probably not be coming up with the next political, mathematical or psychological theory off of the top of your head. 
When the words on your page appear to come from far 
beyond the reach of the average undergraduate’s intellectual capacity or research capabilities, chances are people will think you made it up or copied it. 
To put it simply, if you ever want to be taken seriously in the 
academic or professional world, it is in your best interest not to plagiarize. A mistake like that will stay with you forever. 
Today’s question: Have you ever plagiarized or cheated 
on an assignment?

New students should come out of shells
This is my first column, ever. Well, at least it is the first 
one to be published. I want to make it good. You only get one first impression. 
Today, I want to focus on new students. You all are new to 
college life. It is very different from high school. 
Most of you will be fine. You will find it easy to assimilate 
into the Student Body . 
In all likelihood, you are either the go-to person who 
knows where all the good parties are and who advises your friends on the dos and don’ts, or you are the overachiever who has had things together for years, and you’re on to con-quer the next frontier.
I am speaking to the young adults who may not have it all 
figured out. This is important, so please pay attention. 
The next few years are all about you. You are your own 
boss. You make the rules within the confines of the univer -
sity. 
Now is the time to dream big. This moment in your life is 
the best opportunity to be a daydreamer. Be someone who makes their childhood hopes a breathing reality . Do not let the grandiosity of your future overwhelm you into becoming a living nightmare. 
For all of you outliers on the fringe, daunted by your new 
environment, the best way to overcome it is simple: You need to get involved. 
This is the one shot to make someone of yourself and to do 
better for you, your loved ones and the world around you. 
You must go out and get away from that small circle in 
which you felt comfortable. Find new people. Who knows, you could meet your life-long friend, or you could marry that cute girl in your general anthropology class.
Do not let fear or lethargy call the shots for you. Be the 
captain of the ship, and take charge of your fate. 
I can assure you, no one else is going to do it for you.The Swamp is a community full of zeal. A Student Body 
composed of contentious understandings is what makes the earth go round. You need to find the one thing 
without which you would die if it shot up into space and imploded. 
Passion is the food of the living 
dream. Everybody needs it. Do not let anybody — a professor, a friend or a parent — tell you that you can-not do what you love because it is a lie. 
Grab on to that love and never let it slip through your 
fingers. 
Then, find others who care about it too. If there is a club, 
join it. If there isn’t, make one up. It is a great resource and provides a chance to make a difference in your own life. 
Because last year was my freshman year, I did not do any 
of this. 
This advice comes from personal experience. It is an expe-
rience that I hope you can avoid. 
I lived alone and off-campus. I did not join any clubs. I 
took classes that I hated. I did not follow where my heart was leading me. Misery plagued me, and I never went out to have fun. 
Now, gameday changed everything. Until last year, I was 
never much of a sports fan, let alone a UF football fan. 
Sitting in the crowd with all the other students was a rush. 
The games were exciting. Gators chants created a sense of unity with my fellow students that I had not felt before. 
I am a Gator.Everybody needs to be a part of an organization, whether 
it’s a church youth group, an indie band trying to land that sweet gig or joining a comedy club where you can crack jokes. 
UF is full of opportunities. There are literally people here 
who are opening the door just for you. It is your choice to walk through or stay put.

Tuition increases necessary
I am a graduate student 
who supports tuition increases 
to cover the rising operating costs of UF, including my mea-ger salary . 
There are many reasons for 
my support, but it primarily has to do with the fact that my tuition and the tuition of other instructors, and teaching and research assistants, has been waived as a result of the hard work of Graduate Assistants United.
I would ask all undergradu-
ates who are protesting tuition hikes whether they voted in the midterm elections and for whom they voted.
If you didn’t vote, you 
don’t have much standing to complain about how the state chooses to fund Florida’s insti-tutions of higher learning. 
If you voted for Republicans, 
then you essentially voted for policies and systems of taxation that will continue to directly and indirectly gut state support for education at all levels. 
Ditto your parents. Educa-
tion is expensive; if the state won’t pay for it, then at least part of the cost has to fall back to individual students and fam-ilies. 
Certainly, there are cost-sav-
ing measures that can be put in place, but you can only whittle away so much before you can no longer claim “public Ivy” status. 
UF provides an in-demand 
and highly expensive service. It just makes good old-fashioned capitalistic sense to raise the price of this service if the state and its citizens refuse to subsi-dize it at adequate levels. 
Remember that the next 
time you walk into a voting booth. Your gripe isn’t with UF, it’s with Tallahassee.

Department of Religion Letter to the Editor
Luckily, students around campus don’t take the 
Alligator’s editorials seriously . Last Friday , in the Darts and Laurels editorial, the Alligator sent a 
very clear message to students when they threw a “we-don’t-want-to-pay-higher-tuition-either-but-holding-picket-signs-isn’t-going-to-do-anything DART to Stu-dents for a Democratic Society .” 
According to the Alligator, students should pack up, 
give in and roll over for tuition hikes because activism simply doesn’t work. 
It was a truly ridiculous assertion, and students didn’t 
have to look far for evidence to the contrary . In that very same paper there were two articles that highlighted the impact that student activism has had this semester. 
The first piece described a petition blitz that took 
place over 48 hours on Monday and Tuesday . Students for a Democratic Society collected over 1,200 signatures to put the question of tuition hikes on the Student Gov-ernment ballot. 
Now the students will have a chance to formally 
voice their opposition — just like last semester when 90 percent of the Student Body said no to block tuition. 
Armed with such a huge mandate, students orga-
nized rallies and marches to Tigert Hall, culminating in the Board of Trustees decision to postpone the imple-mentation of block tuition by a year. 
If it wasn’t for the awareness of concerned students 
all over school, block tuition wouldn’t have even been up for discussion. It would have passed quietly without the Student Body knowing until it felt the disastrous effects.
This is why the UF Student 
Body should feel immensely proud reading the Alligator’s 
second activism related piece, announcing that admin-istrators are abandoning block tuition.
The continuing trend of increasing graduation rates 
left administrators without a leg to stand on. They have no choice but to retreat from a misguided policy that they tried to pass in the face of massive student opposition. 
The students were right about block tuition, and 
they’re right again about the 15 percent tuition increase. 
Why is it that Bernie Machen is licking his lips at the 
prospect of tuition hikes even before the extent of the budget cuts is known? Why should students have to take out another loan or work more hours while million-aire administrators pay nothing?
Putting a stop to these tuition increases is in the in-
terest of every student. If we learned anything from the defeat of block tuition, it should be that if the Student Body stands together, we can overcome these attacks on students. 
If you’re interested in helping us organize against tu-
ition increases, you should come out to SDS on Mondays at 6:30 p.m. in Anderson Hall, Room 34.

Speaking Outgraphs. Over the course of four weekends, Marlin and her 
husband, Derrius, along with her son, Justin, and daugh-ter, Lizzie, went around campus and lined up each photo to its present-day counterpart. 
  Each photograph took about an hour to complete, Mar-
lin said.
  “You have to hold up the photo with one hand and have 
the camera in your other hand,” Marlin said. “My husband and son took the photos because I moved too much.”
  Of all the photos that are part of the project, she said 
her favorites include one that captured four girls sitting in a car in front of the Smathers Library at its completion in 1926, and another of a young boy selling soda at a Gators football game in 1960. 
  “When I was standing there, it was as if the little boy 
was there,” Marlin said. “It was weird in a way.”
  Response to the photography project has been over-
whelming, Marlin said.  
  As for the future, the UF Foundation will continue to 
expand the website and may develop the photographs into a calendar. 
  An ofﬁ  cial from the UF Foundation was not available 
to comment.
  The then-and-now photos show UF’s timeless goal to 
improve and expand.
  “They did have the goal to expand the university and 
make it a bigger place,” Marlin said. “All that is alive and well in the people here today.”

A study conducted by the Pew Research 
Center’s Internet & American Life Project last 
month told us this: We are addicted to our cell-phones. 
With 83 percent of American adults today 
having some type of cellphone, it comes as no surprise that people have an attachment to their phones unlike any other.
In a 30-day study conducted by Lisa Merlo, 
assistant professor of psychiatry at UF, and her team, men and women were found to be equally at risk of cellphone addiction, although younger adults showed more symptoms than older adults.
 Individuals with fancier phones were also 
found to exhibit more warning signs than those with more basic models.Fifty-one percent of people with cellphones 
used their phones at least once to get informa-tion they needed right away during the span of the study. Thirteen percent of cellphone users admitted to pretending to use their phones in order to avoid interacting with others around them. 
“I think for the current generation of col-
lege students, [cellphones are] a normal thing for them,” said Steve Orlando, UF spokesman. “That’s what they’ve grown up with, and it’s part of their world. They’ve come to rely on it so much and for so many things. They’re al-most inseparable.” Study: People addicted to phones

players for his quick play calls and fast-paced tempo.
�PLAYERS SAID CALLS ARE 
COMING IN QUICKER.
TOM GREEN
Alligator Staff Writer
Charlie Weis doesn’t like to 
waste time.
It was evident in Florida’s 
season opener against Florida 
Atlantic. The Gators came out with a hurry-up offense in their first possession Saturday and put together a 13-play drive that spanned 6:32 and resulted in the team’s first points of the season.
“Coach Weis, that’s what he 
likes to do,” quarterback John Brantley said. “He likes to get the play in quick, and he gets really mad if we have a delay-of-game penalty.”
Following the first series, 
Florida put together three more efficient touchdown drives. The Gators second drive went for 12 plays and 67 yards and took 3:29 off the clock. That was followed  by a three-play, 68-yard posses-sion in 1:01, while their last scor -
ing drive of the first half was nine plays and 91 yards.
Brantley said the quick play-
calling made life easier on the offense, and everyone had ample time to figure out assignments.

After two years of former UF goalkeeper Katie Fraine mak-
ing life easy on the Gators’ coaching staff, the decision for who 
will play between the pipes each week has gotten a little tough-er in 2011.
Through three starts by senior Brooke Chancey and two by 
freshman Taylor Burke, No. 9 Florida (4-1) has yet to put its finger on who will be this season’s No. 1 option in goal.
“We have a person who’s seen it all, with Brooke being here 
for many, many years. We know what we have with her,” UF goalies coach Robert Liessem Jr. said. “And then you have this kid Taylor who comes in, and we all know her athleticism and 
her upside and the potential. We have to try and bring that out of her.”
Just the second true freshman to start a 
match since 1999, the 6-foot-1 Burke — who is also a jumper on UF’s track and field team — has begun her career with shutouts on the 
road at FIU and then against Texas Tech on Friday.
Chancey, meanwhile, held Miami goal-
less in the season opener but conceded four 
goals in two games against then-No. 18 Texas A&M and then-No. 15 UCLA. Liessem said coach Becky Burleigh and the rest of the staff 
were hesitant to throw Burke into either game, as they thought Chancey provided the better matchup against the two ranked teams because of her experience.
“It’s also really difficult for a freshman to come in, even if 
she’s been playing the best to start,” he said. “The goalkeeper is a very important position, and it’s so much easier to put her in over a period of time, if that’s the eventual goal and if she ends up earning it.”
The matchup with the Red Raiders (3-2) was pressure-filled 
for the freshman, with nearly 4,000 on hand in Pressly Stadium and former Gators Abby Wambach and Heather Mitts looking on from the sidelines.
But after seeing just three shots on goal in her first game, 
Burke again was rarely challenged with just three shots levied Competition at keeper between Burke, Chancey still openGREG LUCA

Florida may not have found five definitive starters on 
the offensive line, but that doesn’t mean the position re-
mains unsettled. 
After the unit’s strong performance Saturday against 
FAU, Will Muschamp and Charlie Weis said they are happy running a seven-man rotation. 
Early in fall camp, Muschamp emphasized the need 
for the offensive line to get “five guys playing well to-gether.” But now, with seven players proving they can make one cohesive unit, that desire no longer exists. 
“On the offensive line I feel pretty settled in,” Mus-
champ said Monday. 
Three players appear to have starting spots locked up: 
junior Xavier Nixon at left tackle, sophomore Jonotthan Harrison at center and sophomore Jon Halapio at right guard. Snaps at right tackle 
are split between redshirt freshman Chaz Green and ju-nior Matt Patchan, while time at left guard is divided between senior Dan Wenger, who can also play center, and sophomore Kyle Koehne. 
Although the group appears jumbled, Muschamp re-
ferred to it as “the mixture of guys we have a great com-fort level with.”
A major concern with an offensive line platoon is a 
lack of chemistry, but Weis said he was happy with the group’s performance against Florida Atlantic. 
“I liked the fact that there looked to be very good co-
hesion,” he said. 
“To keep your mental mistakes low, especially at the 
offensive line position, is sometimes difficult. And, for the most part, that was attained.”
Given the off-field interactions between the linemen, 
it’s not surprising that they’re able to work well together Offensive line

Starter for Friday game 
against FSU undetermined
her way on Friday, compared to the 17 
shots on goal against Chancey in her three starts. 
“It felt really good to get some ex-
perience, especially with that type of crowd and the Florida Gator environ-ment,” Burke said.
Her lone gaffe occurred in the 37th 
minute, when she ventured too far in pursuit of an oncoming attacker and left an empty net. The only thing pre-venting a goal was the heads-up play of defender Kat Williamson, who made it back to the goal line quick enough to clear the incoming shot.
“I’m really impressed with Taylor, 
especially coming in as a freshman and being commanding in her box and I think there’s only better things to come from her,” Williamson said.
While it will take a week of prac-
tice to figure out the starter on Friday against Florida State, Liessem said he would like to see the competition settled before UF hits the meat of Southeastern Conference play, which begins Sept. 23.
“The ultimate goal is to have some-
one really terrific to step up and bring everything that we need encompassing, and really take it over,” he said. 
“As much as it’s a good thing to 
have two talented kids that are doing it, for continuity of the team … it’s a lot easier to have that one and that’s why we were so ridiculously successful with Katie.”

Bryan Ellis probably won’t leave 
Florida Field a winner Saturday. He 
just won’t. He’s not supposed to. 
That won’t make it any easier.It didn’t feel good settling for 
second when UAB walked into Neyland Stadium and came close to stunning Tennessee in front of 95,183 fans last September. 
In his first career start, Ellis 
torched the Volunteers’ secondary, passing for 373 yards and helping overcome a 23-7 halftime deficit.
UAB lost 32-29 in double over -
time, and Vols fans showed ap-preciation for the opponent’s ef-forts. They cheered the underdog quarterback who got his hopes up, who thought maybe, just maybe, he could be a hero.
“I’d rather go off the field to 
boos,” he told The Birmingham News after the game.
Ellis, a redshirt senior, will have 
one last chance to earn some jeers when UAB comes to Gainesville this weekend. In the last five sea-sons, the Blazers have played six games against Southeastern Con-ference teams. They have lost six times, though they nearly scored an upset twice last year, the other coming in a five-point loss at Mis-sissippi State in October.
Like in those six games, UAB 
will be the less talented team when it takes the field at Ben Hill Griffin 
Stadium. Over -
all, the Blazers 
won’t be as fast. They won’t be as strong. They won’t be as skilled. But they also won’t be in-timidated.
“We’ve been 
to some arenas that we can remem-ber experiences from, and hopeful-ly that will help us,” said Ellis, who also played in front 74,656 fans at Texas A&M in 2009. “We have to let the new guys know that it will be like nothing they have experienced, and it will be fun.”
If the Blazers are to keep Satur -
day’s game tight, they will need a strong effort out of their offense. UAB is coming off its two most pro-ductive seasons in school history — 5,111 yards in 2009, 5,074 yards last year.
To keep things running smooth-
ly, the Blazers will put the offense on Ellis’ shoulders. Senior running back Pat Shed — the team’s leading rusher and receiver last season — is questionable with a hernia.
The receiving corps, meanwhile, 
is depleted. Three of the team’s top-five pass catchers from 2010 are gone. Still, the Blazers run a spread system that has consistently marched down the field, and the Gators’ young defensive backfield remains untested.
Last Saturday, Florida had the 
luxury of opening up against a quarterback with just five career pass attempts.
“We have to completely shift 
gears,” coach Will Muschamp said. “That is the one thing that is hard about being a defensive player in the NCAA.”
If Florida’s defense isn’t ready, 
maybe Ellis can surprise them like he did against Tennessee. And maybe he can win this time. But probably not.

UAB will lean on quarterback Ellis against UF on Saturday
Brett Le Blanc / Alligator Staff 
UF goalies coach Robert Liessem Jr. (left) said he would like to have one keeper emerge as the 
best option, similar to former goalie Katie Fraine, who anchored the position the last two years.ellis
on game day. 
Halapio, Koehne and Harrison 
are roommates, and Green said 
his roommate Nixon has been very helpful in his development. Wenger said he was welcomed with open arms the moment he transferred from Notre Dame, and many of the linemen have found themselves pulling for Patchan after seeing him battle through numerous injuries in his career. 
“We all connect together, com-
municate a lot better,” Halapio said. “We all just play well to-gether.”
Green mentioned a number 
of reasons why having a rotation can be positive. 
If Florida is going to continue 
to run the up-tempo attack they used against FAU, the ability to get offensive linemen off the field for a breather will be critical. 
Taking off a few plays can also 
be helpful from a mental stand-point, as the Gators continue to adjust to a new system under offensive line coach Frank Ver -
ducci. 
“You get a better glimpse of the 
whole picture when you’re on the sideline,” Green said. “Playing the game, everything is fast. You have to be able to adjust quick.”
Green added that watching 
a couple snaps from the bench gives Weis and Verducci an op-portunity to offer advice regard-ing the defensive front or block-ing scheme. 
As is always the case, the deci-
sion of who starts Saturday will be made based on performance this week in practice. 
According to Halapio, even 
the players didn’t know who was going to start against FAU until shortly before the game. Now, they know it doesn’t matter. 
“We all trust each other,” Hala-
pio said. “Whoever starts, it’s go-ing to be a good offensive line. I guess we’ll find out.”

Driskel, Joyer impress in limited time against Florida Atlantic
Jon Halapio said. “By the time we got to the ball there was 
already a play there.”
Freshmen impress: Despite not starting, a pair of 
freshmen stood out to teammates on the offensive side of the ball in Saturday’s season-opening 41-3 win against Florida Atlantic.
Quarterback Jeff Driskel and fullback Hunter Joyer 
saw early playing time against the Owls — Driskel as part of coach Will Muschamp’s plan to get him meaningful snaps, and Joyer in part due to the injury sustained by sophomore Trey Burton.
Driskel entered for a series in the second quarter and 
threw an interception on his first career pass attempt. But the dual-threat quarterback didn’t let the mistake bring him down.
“He wasn’t pouting around or anything, he just moved 
on to the next play,” Halapio said, add-ing that for a freshman, Driskel showed great vocal leadership in his first game action.
After Driskel checked back in with 
the game well in hand, he looked more comfortable running the offense.
“You couldn’t have choreographed 
it, really, any better,” Weis said. “He 
comes in, he’s nervous, first time out, 90,000 people in The Swamp; it’s exciting for a kid at that position. But you saw how much more poised he looked the next time out there.”
As for Joyer, he garnered praise from Muschamp on 
Monday for the progress he has made since arriving on campus, as well as his effort Saturday. He also caught the eye of Halapio, who noted Joyer’s full-speed effort since the first day of fall practice.
“He’s real physical, a real smart player for a fresh-
man,” Halapio said. “The thing that stands out to me and my teammates is how physical he is at the fullback posi-tion.”
Gators move up in poll: After entering the season 
ranked No. 22 in the nation, Florida moved up to No. 18 in the latest AP poll released Tuesday. Florida is one of six Southeastern Conference teams ranked in the Top 25.

Matt:  The day we’ve all been waiting for 
came and went Saturday , and for a lot of you 
it was a joyous occasion. 
You thought Florida’s walloping of FAU at 
a filled-to-slightly-less-than-capacity Ben Hill 
Griffin Stadium was convincing. Chris Rainey and Jeff Demps flying up and down the side-lines made you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. And Dominique Easley’s dance moves had you gyrating and smiling in the student sec-tion with your friends (and, maybe, family members at the discounted rate of $50). 
But hold on a minute, OK? Let’s not crown 
these Gators just yet. As good as things looked on Saturday , there’s still plenty yet to be tested — for example, the secondary .  
Florida played a Florida Atlantic team 
that’s quarterback entered the game with as many interceptions (1) as completions. The Owls also started a freshman and sophomore at receiver with a total of 12 receptions to their names. Plus, the dominant performance from the defensive line prevented unproven under -
classmen from being tested at the back end of the Gators’ new defense. 
Graham Wilbert looked woefully inept for 
much of the game Saturday night, but he still managed to complete a 28-yard pass down the seam to tight end Nexon Dorvilus. 
What’s going to happen when UF plays a 
real opponent? That should be the concern, not the Gators’ No. 18 ranking in the new AP Top 25. 
Tyler: You can’t 
use one play as evi-dence against the secondary as a whole. Yeah, FAU managed to complete one 28-yard pass on one third-and-long. Who cares? The score was 24-0; the game was over.
And why are you insulting people for get-
ting excited about Saturday’s game? It wasn’t a great opponent and probably didn’t tell us anything. But how do you want fans to react? You want them to spend their evening not 
cheering. You are an unpleasant, soulless man. Stay positive. There were plenty of good things to take away from Saturday’s win; namely, the running game looked as good as advertised. 
However, Florida will need to show more 
balance in the future — beginning this week-end. The team doesn’t need a more even run-pass ratio; the Gators actually threw the ball three more times than they ran it. But the team does need to get the ball to playmakers not named Demps and Rainey . 
Ignoring incomplete passes, Florida’s two 
burners touched the ball on about 55 percent of plays from scrimmage. Expect defenses to key on Demps and Rainey for the rest of the season. They will stack the box and dare John Brantley to beat them deep. If Florida’s offense wants to be good this year, or at least serviceable against Southeastern Con-
ference powers, Brantley needs to show he can burn teams with the long ball.
Matt: Thanks for solidifying my point, big 
guy. The secondary didn’t have a chance to be exposed. That’s the point. And on the one play where Wilbert actually had time and threw the ball more than 10 yards downfield, guess what happened? It went for a 28-yard gain. 
While the SEC isn’t littered with talent at 
quarterback as in recent years, the Gators will face much stiffer competition in the weeks to come. Even a guy like Tyler Bray at Tennessee has a legitimate chance to torch UF’s inexperi-enced secondary. 
He went 17 of 24 for 293 yards in Week 1, 
connecting with Da’Rick Rogers and Justin Hunter 11 times for 246 of those yards — an average of more than 20 yards for both.
Florida started two freshmen and two 
sophomores and none of them have faced the caliber of player they’re expected to cover week in and week out in the SEC. 
It doesn’t matter how Brantley throws or 
Demps and Rainey run if the secondary can’t hold up against a vertical passing attack.
Tyler: That wasn’t the only time Wilbert 
“tested” the secondary , hater. He threw down field multiple times, and even defensive tackle Omar Hunter said the Gators defensive line did a poor job of applying pressure. 
Offensively, Florida clicked way better 
than it did last season out of the gates, but the passing game still has a lot to prove. The bulk of Brantley’s workload came on short passes. Seventeen of his 29 passes were less than 10 yards. He did great on those, completing more than 80 percent of his passes. 
But while dumping the ball off to Demps 
and Rainey in the flats is easy money against FAU, it won’t work as well down the road. 
Also, Muschamp talks about the impor -
tance of “explosive plays” — runs longer than 10 yards, passes north of 20. Brantley was 0 for 4 on throws of more than 20 yards. He was praised for “taking what the defense gave him” Saturday . We heard that last year, and it didn’t work out so well. 
He has to get the ball downfield this year; 
otherwise the formula for stopping Florida will be easy: stack the box, cover the flats and dare Brantley to throw.
Still unproven: youthful secondary or Brantley’s downfield game?

Florida right guard Jon Halapio (67) said the offensive line now trusts each other. He said their off-the-
field relationships have helped bring the unit closer together.
