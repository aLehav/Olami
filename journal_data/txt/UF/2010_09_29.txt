� THE EVENT WAS PART 
OF HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH.
By SAMANTHA LIEBHABER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students filled the Uni-
versity Auditorium with the 
sound of their voices and their stomping feet at the Hispanic Heritage Month Talent Show 
on Tuesday night. 
The show, hosted by the 
Hispanic Student Association, 
consisted of performances representing all aspects of His-panic culture including dance groups like Sabor Latino and Hands Down, spoken-word acts and various musical per -
formances in Spanish and English. 
The first-place winner for 
the freestyle was Janapelle and the Half Steps, the first-place winner for the vocal was Jan-ioris Diaz, and the first-place winner for dance was Sabor Latino.
Nicole La Hoz, assistant 
director for the talent show, said that everyone involved has been working tirelessly to make the show a success. 
She said the show’s budget 
was about $3,000, and there were around 350 students in attendance.
The Hispanic Student Asso-
ciation, along with other His-panic organizations at UF and the Hispanic Student Associa-tion work together each year to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. 
Xavier Suarez, the Hispanic Student Association president, said that he hopes the event will showcase the talent from the local communities and 
demonstrate Hispanic culture 
so that others can gain an ap-preciation for it.   
Angie Quintana, a UF 
sophomore criminology stu-dent, became a member of the Hispanic Heritage Month marketing team after seeing the excitement generated by last year’s Hispanic Heritage 
month events, particularly the 
talent show. 
“Hispanic culture is just 
fun,” she said. “We like to show people what we’re all about.”
Alberto Rapaport, a senior 
finance major, came to the show after being invited by friends 
and seeing the advertisements 
for Hispanic Heritage Month 
events around campus. 
He said that supporting the 
UF Hispanic community is im-portant because minorities de-serve the same opportunities as others. 
“That’s what this accom-
plished,” he said. “I thought it was a great and highly enter -
taining show.”

festivities will continue until Oct. 14. By JOEY FLECHAS

Just after 7 a.m. Tuesday, when the campus street lights 
were still lit, students in navy shirts armed with stacks of 
fliers began to take their places across campus.  
For the Unite Party, 750 students were out making their 
11th-hour push, touting their platforms as the first day of Student Government elections wore on.
The first day saw more than 4,900 students go to the 
polls, an amount Supervisor of Elec-tions Amanda Griffin said did not buck the trend.
“It’s about the same in numbers 
compared to last fall,” she said.
At least one complaint was filed with the election com-mission, and the commission chair ordered independent candidates to stop identifying themselves as members of 
a coalition of students, due to implications that the coali-
tion is a registered party.
Neil Gundavda, independent senator, said that no one 
has said that the Independent Coalition is a registered party. He said independent candidates have filed their 
expense reports and campaigned independently. 
“These accusations are completely false,” he said.About 4,900 vote on first day of SG election

ON CAMPUS
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Staff Writer
UF’s chapter of the internation-
al nonprofit group One launched 
a campaign Tuesday to get stu-
dents involved with November’s senatorial election.
The campaign, One Vote 2010, 
kicked off with a conference call 
that featured George W. Bush’s 
daughter, Barbara Bush, encour -
aging students to take advantage of their political power and will-
ingness to advocate for the cause.
“College students have an ex-
tremely unique position in poli-
tics today,” she said. 
The campaign is also taking 
place at other chapters at colleges across the country. Domonique Worship, president of the UF chapter, said her group is aim-
ing to drum up support among 
students who care about ending poverty.
“We’re trying to infuse the stu-
dent body in the fight against ex-
treme global poverty,” she said.
“We just want to show people 
that they really can make a differ -
ence.”
Matt Higginson, the national campaign’s senior manager of 
college organizing, said the goal is to make sure  college chapters 
are utilized to influence their local 
campaigns and flex their political muscle.
Worship, a political science 
senior, said the group’s aim is to push candidates to support leg-islation favorable to people in developing countries, specifically through The Global Fund to Fight 
AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.
During the conference call, 
Bush clearly 
outlined the 
c a m p a i g n ’ s 
goal.
“We need to 
make sure the global fund is 
replenished this 
year,” she said. 
The UF chapter of One Cam-
pus is also participating in a 
school supplies drive that ben-
efits underprivileged families in Gainesville.
The group, with the help of 
the Gainesville chapter of Altrusa 
International, is collecting school 
supplies at Library West and 155 Tigert Hall.UF nonprofit chapter

� UNIVERSITY COPY WILL MOVE IN 
WITH TARGET COPY. 
By MARISSA PRIETO
Alligator Contributing Writer
University Copy & More, which has 
been at 1620 W University Ave. for 43 years, 
has outgrown its location and will merge with its sister store, Target Copy , starting Friday.
University Copy & More and Target 
Copy, 1412 W University Ave., are owned by the same company and have been work-ing together for years. 
Instead of relocating to a separate part 
of town, the company decided to move the store a few blocks away to Target Copy, which has more than five times as much square footage.
“You can only do so much with 800 
square feet,” said Bob Oetter, the president of University Copy & More and Target Copy . “Customers couldn’t get everything we could offer because we just didn’t have the room.”
As the industry has grown, and copy 
stores have been able to add services, the machines have grown in size and sophis-
tication. In the past, fewer computers were needed because certain services weren’t 
available, Oetter said.
University Copy & More wants to pro-
vide its customers with the most up-to-date services, but the size of the machines makes it difficult to do so. Some new machines 
can be up to 18 feet long, and manufactur -
ers require additional space on each side for 
repairs, Oetter said. This is space University Copy & More does not have.
“The biggest benefit will be the fact that 
we can put our best foot forward,” Oetter 
said. “Customers will have a much clearer 
picture of what we can do for them and what we can do to make it easier for them.”
At this time, four University Copy & 
More employees have been relocated to the two Target Copy locations. Two employees are still interviewing and going over avail-ability, Oetter said, but they will have prior -
ity over open positions.Copy centers shack up

clearer picture of what we can 
do for them and what we can do

A 4-year-old foster child of a gay cou-
ple was skeptical at first about letting his 
new fathers feed or change his little broth-er’s diapers.
Martin Gill, one of his new fathers, said 
it was apparent that the older child had to help take care of his infant brother in the past. When the state wanted to take the boys away from Gill and split the brothers up to place them in permanent homes, he sued to adopt them.
More than five years later, Gill is still 
fighting to adopt the brothers, and on Tuesday night he and the American Civil 
Liberties Union presented a new docu-
mentary on  Florida’s gay adoption ban, the only one in the country . 
The film, “In Anita’s Wake: The Irratio-
nal War on Florida’s Gay Families,” was shown at the Hippodrome State Theater.
Gay families are no different than fami-
lies with heterosexual parents, said Vicki Nantz, one of two filmmakers.
Gill said he was doing what any parent 
would do – fighting for his children. He said he wants to give them continuity and 
permanency, rather more disruption.
Gill is closer than ever to his dream of 
adopting the kids. On Sept. 
22, a three-judge panel of the Third District Court of Appeals unanimously ruled 
there’s no rational basis for excluding gay men and lesbians from adopting. 
Gill and his attorney,  Shelbi Day with 
ACLU, said they were hopeful the state would not appeal the decision to the State Supreme Court, but said they believed if it was appealed, Gill had the best possible 
chance of overturning the case of anyone 
since the ban was passed in 1977. Adoption ban plaintiff,

The  newborns are com-
ing. 
MSNBC reports the 
“Twilight” craze has made a real biting impact with some 
of its most fervent fans. The 
book-turned-movie craze has impacted some teenagers so much that nationwide reports of teenagers biting the necks of their peers is  disturbingly on the rise.  
To the dismay of health 
officials who warn the trend 
could lead to HIV infection, 
hepatitis an army of other infections and, surprisingly , a lack of immortality , reports of American teens giddy with the taste of blood have now become an actual health con-cern.  
We’re not going to lie. 
We’ve been swept up into the “Twilight” craze, too. We’ve read the books shamefully and secretly . We’ve seen the midnight showings of the movies. But we also realize our pit-
falls of mortality and the little there is to change that.  
As much as some of us 
would love our future to in-
volve a stone-cold brooding 
vegetarian, V olvo-driving vampire, we sadly realize this will never happen. And Bella has nothing to do with this. 
Biting each other’s necks 
won’t solve anything, kids. You’ll still be mortal. And you’ll probably have just con-
tracted a nasty infection. 
We are perhaps just as 
alarmed as national health of-
ficials with the apparent trend. We often scoff at parents’ un-necessary woes of teenage trends (remember Pogs?), but this is something we should all be worried about. 
This is not like pretend-
ing you’re a Hufflepuff and drinking a vial of Felix Felicis. This is a serious public health concern. Kids, please just stop biting one another. It’s gross. Netflix takeover signals TV’s death
Well, it looks like I survived the shellacking from 
last week. I was overwhelmed by the feedback, and I want to clarify that I believe Humans vs. 
Zombies is a valuable student organization here at UF, just like any other. I in no way intended to compare them to Dove World or any of the real plagues that are affecting UF.
Regardless of football players’ trouble with the law or 
the recent sexual abuse scandals plaguing campus — it’s a game, no more, no less. I was also trying to mention the dangerous effects of extremism — be it from dedicated H 
vs. Z players or from rabid Florida football fans. I apologize 
for those I offended, and I promise that was not my intent.
And now for something completely different.
Netflix, of which I’m a proud paying customer, made a 
landmark decision this week. Starting with its new season, 
Saturday Night Live will make episodes streamable via 
Netflix immediately after airing. That in itself is not incred-
ibly innovative. 
Network websites and Hulu.com have been doing this 
at a slight delay for the past year. What is innovative is that the entire library of Saturday Night Live is now available on Netflix’s instant streaming service.
The first group of people satisfied by this are those who 
have longed for the SNL glory days — be it “Da Bears” or “The Ladies’ Man” or if you just thought Phil Hartman and Chris Farley were funnier than Will Forte and Kenan Thompson. No longer are the episodes sliced into ‘”Best-Of” DVDs and occasional NBC specials. They’ll now be available at the click of a button.
The more significant group of people are the people af-
fected in the long term. Netflix is cashing in on what Hulu.com has been doing for the past year or two, but it hopes to do it on a much larger scale. It’s moving away from its original business model after suc-ceeding in its first goal of replacing Blockbuster, Hollywood Video and other traditional video stores as the primary source for DVD rentals. Now it’s looking for its next target: replac-ing Hulu.com and online streaming websites as the primary source for time-shifted programming.
It’s time to declare what the bell has been tolling recently. 
Live TV has breathed its last breath and died. 
DVRs, Hulu.com, and YouTube are permeating culture, 
and the need to get together and watch live television has been reduced to sporting events and important national events like the State of the Union or a Presidential Inaugu-ration.
As it stands, time shifting isn’t perfect. You need ex-
pensive equipment like a DVR, and you still have to deal with the burden of fast forwarding during those annoying commercials. The only way to stay somewhat up to date without encountering those issues is renting the previous seasons on DVD like you can on websites like Netflix.
But even doing that puts the viewer behind a season, 
even though he or she is able to watch at their leisure for a menial fee. 
Moves like this from Netflix are much more convenient 
and allow people to escape the previous constraints of streaming and time shifting.
The biggest issue now are the holdout channels like 
Comedy Central and AMC that won’t allow streaming in any sense. Here’s to hoping Netflix can be the business that changes that stance.

Economic polarity at its 
widest point 
We’ve been brainwashed ever since we set up our free 
market lemonade stands on the sidewalk, charging parched passersby an excess of a quarter for a cup 
of juice.  
We’ve been told capitalism makes us great. It makes us 
better than everyone else, especially the socialists and com-munists who don’t know how to manage their money. 
And we rarely ever question it. Until now.  Census figures released this month show the gap between 
the wealthiest Americans and the poorest is growing, not shrinking.  
In fact, the disparity is at the widest, most unequal gap 
it’s ever been.  
According to the data, the top one-fifth of America’s 
wealthiest citizens make almost half of all income in the country compared with only less than 4 percent generated by Americans who live below the poverty line. 
This accounts for the largest disparity in income among 
all Western industrialized nations.  
This is capitalism at work. This is the free market. This 
isn’t fair. 
At a time when the wealthiest Americans are getting even 
richer and the poor are getting even poorer — 6.3 percent of 
Americans now live below the poverty line —  we can’t help 
but wonder if our system of money-mongering is the best it could be. 
Sure, we’re all for making the most money we possibly 
can. We’re not about to go out and burn effigies of supporters of the free market. But these statistics really make us wonder, would our lemonade stands have worked better if the wealth was shared equally among children in the neighborhood?

Since the time of our founding during the 
spring 2009 election cycle, the Unite Party 
has been committed to delivering real, tan-
gible results to the Student Body. 
Founded upon principles of positivity, Unite 
has consistently sought to identify issues that 
matter to the students and improve the overall 
quality of campus life. These ideas, formulated 
through direct interaction with students, form the core of every Unite Party campaign.
Our track record speaks for itself. Each and 
every one of the promises we made to the Stu-dent Body since our founding during the last election have been accomplished. Addition-ally, the majority of our points featured on last spring’s platform have been accomplished with the remainder of our promises well on their way to completion. Ranging from the creation of a late-night study center at the Reitz Union to the installation of a redbox to improving the efficiency of the SNAP program, the results we delivered have tangibly impacted student life. That is our commitment. The core of every Unite Party campaign has always been, and shall al-ways be, our promise to deliver results that mat-ter to the students. This semester is no 
different. Our platform, 
developed by students 
through our platform 
generation events across campus, features fresh ideas that will impact each and every student. 
We have sought to address the issues that span 
the entire campus, reaching out to both graduate 
and undergraduate students. Again the focus is concrete ways we can help the students, rang-ing from addressing transportation concerns through the creation of an RTS bus tracking cen-ter in the Reitz Union and establishing an electric car service to provide routes for campus events and late-night transportation alternatives, to ad-dressing the housing issues of off-campus stu-dents by partnering with Student Legal Services to help ensure apartment complexes are fair in leasing prices and overages.
However, our work on your behalf cannot 
continue without your support. We are the party of experience, communication and results. We hope you will partner with us this election to continue to help make this great campus an even better place.
Micah Lewis is the Unite Party spokesman. Unite members care for studentsGuest columnI have attempted, after my res-ignation, to keep distance from this election, especially because, 
with the demise of Student Alliance, I don’t really have much of a dog in 
this race. However, a letter in Mon-
day’s Alligator was so misleading, I 
had to say something.
I am very irritated Lindsay 
would write a letter like this, espe-
cially after having taken a class with her and carrying on many honest discussions about Student Govern-ment. She made it seem as though some loyal Unite Party volunteer convinced her to join the cause, but this is far from the case.
Lindsay Davis, or more appro-
priately in this setting, Director Da-vis, is the Unite Party and President Charles’ director of the Community Political Affairs Cabinet. This is like pretending a member of Obama’s cabinet was somehow convinced by a volunteer to vote Democratic and wrote into the New York Times 
to describe this experience. 
It’s ridiculous at face value. Any 
letter I ever wrote regarding SG had 
full disclosure, stating I was the Senate Minority Leader. 
When Unite Party appointees, 
especially the principal officer of the Community Political Affairs Cabinet, write in letters pretending 
they are somehow outside of SG, it 
is insulting to the intelligence of the entire Student Body . 
That they are willing to so bra-
zenly lie (or lie by omission) about their role in SG shows they care more about winning and staying in power than they do about gov-ernance or the students. Having 
had many conversations with Unite 
Party operatives and understand-ing their internal structure, I’m rela-tively sure Director Davis didn’t, in fact, write this letter herself, but that it was 
instead produced by someone in 
her media department.
However, this doesn’t change 
the fact that she put her name on 
it, something I am extremely upset about. I don’t understand why the Unite Party bothered to do this, as they face no real opposition party like they did with the Student Al-liance. I predict Unite will win no 
fewer than 45 out of the 50 seats up 
for election this fall, despite The Al-ligator’s endorsement of the Inde-pendents.
Regardless of my feelings about 
the election or the actions of Direc-tor Davis, the students deserve to know when a letter supposedly written by an SG outsider was in 
fact written (or at least submitted) 
by one of SG’s top-ranking officials. Many parties and groups are guilty of this, but never in so brazen a manner as this. 
The opinions page should be a 
forum for the exchange of stances and ideas, not a creative writing journal.
Despite the easily predictable 
outcome of this election, in which Unite will maintain its superma-jority in the Senate and continue to control the three branches of SG, students and readers need to learn moral conduct is important.
 The lying and deception we see 
in real government starts because people think it’s okay to do so here, stepping onto the slippery slope.
For this reason, and hopefully so 
Ms. Davis can learn from her mis-takes, it is imperative that all the facts come to light.

One of Israel’s top selling points is its location at the junc-
tion between East and West. In Tel Aviv along the beautiful beaches, you could be in any major European city, judging by the nightlife and cosmopolitan feel, but you’ll be eating authen-tic Middle Eastern food, listening to raucous conversation in 
Hebrew or enjoying a hookah with friends at the same time.
If you’re looking for a bit more culture and history, Jerusa-
lem is the place to go. Less then an hour away from Tel Aviv , 
the attire is more modest, the nights a bit quieter, and you feel that certain holy , spiritual quality you would expect in the Holy Land.
Unfortunately, that feeling may be slightly unsettled by the 
unavoidable military presence throughout Israel. If you are not able to find an Israeli cab, going through Israeli Defense 
Force checkpoints in a Palestinian taxi will definitely add to 
your travel time. Since military service is mandatory , all adults know how to use guns and often carry them around, which may startle an unprepared American tourist. And yes, Israel is pretty concerned with safety , so security checks abound and the beautiful tourists sights are intertwined with mazes of fenc-es, walls and barriers.
Despite the military presence, “Israelis say they have moved 
on” from their fears of attacks, according to a recent Time Magazine article (“Why Israel Doesn’t Care About Peace,” Sept. 2, 2010), and feel confident living their lives. Indeed, despite Israel’s security issues, Israe-
lis have “moved on” — they overcame the obstacles and live relatively normal lives. Isn’t this what Palestinians ought to do, too? Bury the hatchet and continue about their lives as Israelis 
have? Yes. But it’s more difficult in their case.
This is exactly what some Palestinians have done, such as 
those who were displaced in 1948 when the state of Israel was 
consolidated in a catastrophic war. Those Palestinians accepted reality , the reality that their homes were now underneath the foundations of the Jewish state. They became Palestinian refu-gees, which is the largest refugee population in the world and the only nation of refugees to have its own U.N. body , UNRWA. So yes, the refugees of 1948 who left the region that became Is-
rael “moved on,” literally.
The refugees who settled in the rest of Palestine (the West 
Bank and Gaza) after 1948 clung on a bit longer to the hope 
of returning to their homes and to normality, despite the fact that Israel razed their villages and turned the land into airports, national parks or new cities. But after the 1967 war, when Israel advanced into the West Bank and Gaza and began its occupa-tion of those lands in violation of numerous international laws 
and U.N. resolutions, more Palestinians “moved on” and be-gan “normal” lives in other countries.
When Israelis chose to “move on,” they remained in their 
homes. Their nation is intact, secure and free. Palestinians are 
kept out. The Israelis drive on separate roads to their settle-ments in the West Bank, which is referred to as Judea and Sa-maria. Many settlers don’t realize their presence there is illegal, because no distinction is made between Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. Israelis in Israel itself see little evidence of the occupation. If they want to “move on,” they simply skip over the critical articles in the paper about the West Bank.
Palestinians would be very happy to “move on” as well. 
“Moving on,” however, is a bit more difficult when Israel con-trols every aspect of your life. Israel directs on a day-to-day ba-sis whether or not you can travel to your school or to your job and whether you can leave your city . They decide when you receive water and how much of it you receive. Israel controls whether or not aid organizations can deliver you their sup-plies. Israel even manages what the Palestinian Authority can and cannot control.
The West Bank is a part of Israel that most tourists and most 
Israelis don’t see. Israel can’t pretend Palestinians have any op-tions to move forward when the occupation restricts necessary Palestinian autonomy . Palestinians would be happy to move on, as Israelis have. All Israel needs to do is let them.

UWire ONE BILL WOULD ERADICATE VIP TICKETS FOR 
SG MEMBERS TO ACCENT AND SGP EVENTS.  
By KAT BEIN
 Alligator Staff Writer
 
  Senators voted against two bills that would reduce privi-
leges for Student Government ofﬁ  cials during Tuesday night’s 
meeting.
  The ﬁ  rst aimed to require senators with meal cards to sub-mit a record of their purchases each month, along with justiﬁ  -cations for the purchases.
  According to the bill, $9,500 is set aside for the Student 
Body president, vice president, treasurer and budget committee to spend on food while conducting SG business, but there is no method to track spending.
  The second bill would have done away with distribution of 
VIP tickets for SG members to Student Government Produc-
tions and Accent events.
  Both bills were voted upon with little debate and failed by a majority vote.
  “It’s absolutely disgusting what happened here tonight,” 
said Sen. Alan Yanuck, member of the Student Alliance party 
and co-author of the bills. “When we try to discuss anything this is what happens … I’m kind of still reeling, I don’t know how that worked.”
  Unite Party spokesman Micah Lewis said his party would 
rather be spending time passing legislation that would bring real results instead of focusing on partisan issues.
  “We as a party are not going to sit here and let ourselves be 
held hostage by partisan issues,” he said. 8, ALLIGATOR  WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 2010

  Freshman Brooklyn Perry receives a ballot in the Graham area ofﬁ  ce to partake in the vote for this year’s 
Student Senate race. 
Voting continues today
  Voters said some of the issues 
they were most concerned with 
were budgets and providing Wi-
Fi all over campus. 
  Some voters said they came 
out to get involved in the politi-
cal process.
  “I ﬁ  gured I’d do my part,” 
said Alex Gonzalez, a computer engineering sophomore.
  Gonzalez said he’s preferred 
this fall’s election season to the 
last because he’s been able to 
speak individually with candi-dates.
  Nick Sands, an aerospace en-
gineering junior, said the com-bination of a friend’s encourage-ment and an interest in the issues at stake compelled him to cast his ballot.
  “I voted for people I felt would use the money in the cor-rect way,” he said.
  Other students voted because 
they couldn’t escape it.
  Mathematics junior Jordan 
Draper said he was voting be-
cause of pressure from his frater-
nity.
  “It’s frowned upon,” he said, 
when asked what would happen if he didn’t vote.
  He also said it was implied 
that he should be voting for the 
Unite Party.
  “That’s the direction that they 
take it,” he said. ELECTION , from page 1StudentGovernment Senate strikes down bill to reduce ofﬁ  cials’ perks

LOCAL 
By ANNIE BOGGS
Alligator Contributing Writer
A recent study has found that 
nearly one in five gay or bisexual 
sexually active men have HIV , but local health officials and LGBT rep-resentatives cautioned others to be critical of the new findings. 
“That’s a really high number,” 
said Andrea Stokes, director of 
LGBT Affairs at UF. “I think it begs 
some further questioning.” 
The study, conducted by the 
Kaiser Family Foundation, was based on tests and interviews of 8,000 male adults from 21 U.S. cit-ies. Forty-four percent of those who 
tested positive for HIV were not aware they were infected.
“It’s a shame,” said Bobby Da-
vis, HIV/AIDS program coordina-tor for the Alachua County Health Department. 
However, because the study 
was based in cities, it does not nec-essarily reflect local statistics, Da-
vis said. 
In Alachua County, there are 
estimated to be 634 people living 
with HIV , according to the health department. Males make up 65 percent of those infected with HIV and 57 percent of those men are gay or bisexual.Nationwide, about 1.1 million 
people are estimated to be living with HIV , and about 75 percent of these are male, according to the 
Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention. This amounts to less than one 
percent of the adult U.S. popula-tion. 
“AIDS is 100 percent prevent-
able, short of being born to HIV 
and receiving it through a trans-
fusion,” Davis said. “Every health department offers testing.”
The Center for Disease Control 
and Prevention recommends that sexually active adolescents and adults get tested at least once a year for HIV .
Joseph Antonelli, president of 
the Gainesville Community Al-liance, acknowledged a lack of HIV/AIDS knowledge and people potentially not realizing it’s still a danger.
“I think there’s been a tremen-
dous drop off in HIV-prevention education,” he said. “There’s an absolute need to get tested.”
Donnie Fields, president of 
Pride Student Union at UF, warned against generalizing the study’s findings and considering HIV/AIDS a “gay problem.”
“”It affects everyone,” he said. 
“Twenty-one cities can’t be repre-sentative of the entire male popu-lation.”
“It becomes a slippery slope 
when you begin looking at statis-tics rather than human beings,” Fields said. 
Local groups question validity of recent HIV study
� THE BLOG IS PART OF A COURSE 
ON PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT.
By JORDAN PETERS
Alligator Contributing Writer 
UF honors students have started a blog 
to provide guidance to incoming fresh-men.
The blog, “Swamp Survival,” is the 
brainchild of Melissa Johnson, assistant di-
rector of the Honors Program. Ten sophomores from Johnson’s course, 
Professional Development 3: Community 
Outreach, will write blog posts focusing on a different aspect of the first-year college experience. 
“Acclimating to university life can be a 
huge change, and there are many missteps that can be easily avoided with a little ad-vice,” said Lauren Hundley, a sophomore pre-pharmacy student who contributes to the blog. 
The blog, which can be found at www.
swampsurvival.wordpress.com, has top-ics including how to take advantage of the Career Showcase and how to get the best letter of recommendation from a professor. 
The blog also uploads video posts every 
Friday. 
One of the students, Daniel 
Collotte, a sophomore electrical engineering major, is assisting his classmates with filming and 
editing these videos. 
“I’ve already seen my leadership skills 
reinforced by the fact that we’re thinking about bringing them to other people, teach-ing them to other people,” Collotte said. 
Johnson said that hearing advice from 
older students can be more useful for first-year students than hearing the same things from advisers or professors. Older students also offer a unique perspective on the first-year experience, being only a few months removed from it themselves.
“We thought back to what kind of ques-
tions we had when we were going to first attend ... and we wanted to present those answers in an entertaining, easy-to-access format,” Collotte said.

it through a transfusion.

QUOTABLE POLL QUESTION TWITTERHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF wide receiver Carl Moore recorded four catches for 72 yards Saturday. All of his receptions helped Florida 
convert on third downs.
 “I’ve never been scared of another foot-
ball player. I go against Carl
Johnson every day, if he doesn’t eat me, 
I’m good.”

Vote at alligatorSports.orgBy KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator.org
 
Last week Carl Moore said 
the receivers were having a hard 
time getting yards after the catch because of the routes they were 
running and where quarterback 
John Brantley was throwing the ball. 
Saturday , the passing offense 
had its most productive game of the season, totaling 290 yards through the air, and the receiv-ers finally did some running with the ball in their hands. 
“What you saw last week 
was (Moore) went up and got those catches, but then he knifed the defense, he got vertical up the field,” offensive coordinator Steve Addazio said.  “I thought that was significant, both he and Deonte [Thompson] did that.” 
As a result, Thompson led 
the team with five catches for 86 yards, and Moore hauled in four passes for 72 yards. Each of Moore’s catches went for first downs on third-and-long. 
At 6-foot-4, Moore is an ideal 
possession receiver, tall enough to catch the ball at its highest point and provide a big target for Brantley on third downs and in the red zone. Against the Wildcats, Moore showed he’s ca-pable of picking up tough yards after moving the chains. 
“We definitely got the ball in 
situations where we could do something after the catch, and I think we made the most of the opportunities that we had,” 
Moore said. 
Burton not just a goal-line 
threat: True freshman Trey Bur -
ton did his best Trick Daddy 
impression on every one of his runs against UK, taking it to the house on all five of his carries out of the wildcat formation.
None of his runs were lon-
ger than 11 yards, and Burton already had a pair of two-yard touchdown runs to his name prior to Saturday , but offensive coordinator Steve Addazio said that Burton’s wildcat role is not Moore emerges as 
third-down threat

The No. 6 Florida soccer team (8-
1-1, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) is 
back home this week after a daunt-
ing five-game road trip very opti-mistic about SEC play.
The Gators finished the road trip 
3-1-1, with their only loss coming against two-time defending cham-
pion and No. 3 North Carolina, the nation’s 
top-ranked team at 
the time. However, they swept their first two conference oppo-
nents on the road, a better weekend 
of SEC play away from Gainesville 
than the team experienced all of last UF returns home after 
month-long road tripBefore you start cleaning your grill and 
marinating your steak in preparation for Saturday’s showdown, take a step back.
Actually take about 11 steps back. Seems a 
little far, doesn’t it?
That amount of steps you just took is the 
same amount of starters the Gators lost in the 
offseason. 
Fans see the game against Alabama as re-
demption for last year’s SEC Championship 
loss, but it’s far from it. It can’t be considered re-demption if it’s an entirely different team beat-
ing the Crimson Tide. 
Almost all of the key players on the team 
that lost to Alabama last season are now play-
ing on Sundays for NFL squads.
The personnel, the play-calling and the team 
leaders have all changed since Florida’s embar -
rassing performance against Alabama on Dec. 5.
Which is exactly why expectations should 
be tempered.
What used to be a Tim Tebow-led offense is now a Mike Pouncey-led offense. What used to be a Brandon Spikes-
led defense is now a Jus-
tin Trattou-led defense.
Fans are witnessing 
a new chapter in Gators 
football, and it’s unfair 
to refuse to turn the page on the old chapter, telling this team to take 
care of last season’s unfinished business.
It’s like expecting an ex-heavyweight cham-
pion who lost 60 pounds to step in the ring and not miss a beat.
That’s not possible.
The Gators’ matchup against the Crimson 
Tide is merely part of the process of regaining 
the weight they lost in the offseason.
A win is not the end-all-be-all for Florida.Instead, this is what you should be looking 
for in Saturday’s game.Perspective is key this weekend“We definitely got the 
ball in situations where 
we could do something 
after the catch.”

on finishing near goalCan the Gators establish a passing game 
early? Quarterback John Brantley came into the 
Kentucky matchup averaging just 5.72 yards per 
pass attempt, but he showed he could throw the 
ball downfield Saturday.
With Demps unlikely to be 100 percent be-
cause of a foot injury , the Gators should try to 
take advantage of an inexperienced Crimson 
Tide secondary, which surrendered 357 passing yards last week against Arkansas. 
If offensive coordinator Steve Addazio can 
dial up some pass plays to involve some of the 
receivers, it will be a good sign for UF.
What will Burton’s role be this week? You 
better believe coach Nick Saban has Alabama well-versed on Trey Burton’s every move and 
tendency after the freshman’s six-touchdown game.
Burton may not turn in a repeat performance, 
but Florida could definitely plug him in to grab 
the attention of the Crimson Tide defense to 
open other things up in the offense.
Don’t be surprised if coach Urban Meyer 
uses him at quarterback in situations other than 
the red zone this week because of the attention 
he will garner.
Can the defense continue to force turnovers 
at this pace? The Gators have forced 14 turn-
overs, with 12 off interceptions, in four games 
this season.
The school record for most picks in a season 
is 26, and the Florida defense is on pace to smash 
it.
Crimson Tide quarterback Greg McElroy has 
already thrown three interceptions this year. It 
will be key for the defense to pressure him into more mistakes Saturday.
If fans won’t be satisfied unless the Gators 
win — fine. But sometimes you need to take a step (or 11) back to look at the bigger picture.season.
“They handled this road trip really well,” UF coach 
Becky Burleigh said. “A year ago we were hoping to win 
two on the road in a row, and this year we were disap-
pointed with two wins and two shutouts on the road be-
cause we feel like we left a lot of goals on the field.”
Efficiency in front of the goal has been the Gators’ Achil-
les’ heel. UF averaged almost 14 shots a game on the road trip, but only 41 percent were on target. 
A defensive-minded team, Florida has struggled to con-
vert tenacity on the back line into consistent composure on offense. 
The Gators have still found the goal — the loss to UNC 
was the only game this season in which they failed to score — but Burleigh described the difficulty in finishing as “a long process” because it takes synchronized cooperation 
from just about every player on the field.
“Finishing requires a big thought process and fine mo-
tor skills,” Burleigh said. 
“That’s where we are working on being a little more 
disciplined, and it’s going to be something we spend a lot 
of time on from this point forward.“
Even though the team has had its struggles with finish-
ing, Burleigh believes the Gators have been able to domi-nate all facets of play.
“The hardest part about soccer is finishing,” Burleigh 
said. “We’re going to continue to work on it in practice, but it’s still that one little missing piece that we have from 
being a great team.”
While the Gators may be a young team, they don’t lack 
in leadership, and the guidance of captain and leading 
scorer McKenzie Barney has paved the way for freshmen 
like Taylor Travis to thrive.
“McKenzie brings a lot of energy to the field; she is 
like the Energizer Bunny out there,” Burleigh said. “I re-
ally like the leadership on this team. I think they’ve done a great job at getting the younger players ready for what 
we have to face.”
Going into this weekend’s matchup, the Gators are 
just happy to be home and ready to take care of business 
against Mississippi State. 
“I think the team is a little road-weary,” said Burleigh. 
“And getting back to playing at Pressly Stadium will be nice.”WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 29, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 15

With the acquisition of Trent Edwards, Jaguars coach Jack Del Rio will have an extra 
option under center this week.
Lemmens: Ingram, Richardson may be best college RB duo ever
going to be limited to goal-line situations. 
“We’re going to gradually increase that, grow with that,” 
Addazio said. “That will continue to go and continue to grow 
in all forms.”
Coach Urban Meyer said after the game that UF is in its base 
offense when Burton is in the game, meaning running isn’t the only option. Burton showed that when he rolled to his right and hit 
Omarius Hines for a 42-yard completion in the fourth quarter. 
“I think you saw a component of option back 
in our offense both with John and with Trey, so we’re creating really great balance in how we’re going to attack a defense,” Addazio said. “We’re 
creating many more things for them to have to 
worry about now.”
Ingram and Richardson G.O.A.T.?: Defensive lineman Duke Lemmens knows UF is going to have its hands full with 
Alabama’s running back duo of 2009 Heisman Trophy winner Mark Ingram and super sophomore Trent Richardson. 
“Not only is that probably the best running back corps may-
be in the history of college football with those two, but they have a great O-line, and it’s a great test for us,” Lemmens said. “This is why you come to Florida, for games like this.”
Richardson has 482 yards from scrimmage and four touch-
downs for the Tide this season, and Ingram has 335 yards from scrimmage and four touchdowns in two games.FOOTBALL , from page 14THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
JACKSONVILLE — Showing just how 
frustrated they are with quarterback David 
Garrard, the Jacksonville Jaguars claimed former Buffalo Bills starter Trent Edwards off 
waivers Tuesday.
Edwards is expected to sign a contract 
Wednesday morning and join his new team-
mates at practice later in the day.
The Jaguars waived linebacker Alvin Bo-
wen to make room for Edwards on the roster.
The move gives Edwards a fresh start af-
ter things went south in Buffalo and provides Jacksonville with a viable option behind Gar -
rard.
Edwards started the first two games for 
Buffalo this season, completing 29 of 52 pass-es for 241 yards and a touchdown. He also threw two interceptions and lost both games, prompting coach Chan Gailey to turn to Ryan Fitzpatrick to spark an inept offense.
With Fitzpatrick under center, the Bills 
managed 374 yards — more than Edwards 
mustered in his two starts. Gailey released Ed-
wards on Monday.
Edwards could get a second chance in 
Jacksonville, especially if Garrard continues to perform like he has the last two weeks.
Garrard threw four interceptions and was 
benched in a 25-point loss at San Diego. He was even worse Sunday at home, completing 13 of 30 passes for 105 yards and an intercep-
tion in another 25-point loss to Philadelphia. 
He was also sacked six times and botched a 
pitch to running back Maurice Jones-Drew.
Coach Jack Del Rio said Garrard seemingly 
lost confidence following the sixth loss in his last seven starts. Del Rio also made it clear 
how he felt about his quarterback’s play.
“As long as he’s our best option, we’ll con-
tinue to go with him,” Del Rio said Monday.
Those sentiments are not really new. Del 
Rio and team owner Wayne Weaver chal-lenged Garrard in January. Del Rio called Gar -
rard a “second-tier quarterback,” and Weaver 
said he needed to be more accountable and 
spend more time working with the team’s young receivers.
Garrard responded with what coaches and 
teammates called his best offseason. He even threw three touchdown passes in the opener. But poor decisions, bad throws and costly turnovers plagued him the last two weeks.
Jacksonville had few options, too.Backup Luke McCown replaced Garrard 
in San Diego but tore a knee ligament late in the game and was placed on injured reserve. The Jaguars signed 38-year-old Todd Bouman but only went with him because he spent the 2008 and 2009 training camps with them and knew the offense.
Edwards’ arrival could signal the end of 
Garrard’s tenure in Jacksonville. Garrard signed a six-year, $60 million extension in 2008. It was the richest contract in franchise history and included $18 million guaranteed. Jags acquire QB Edwards
“As long as [Garrard is] our best 
option, we’ll continue to go with 
him.”
