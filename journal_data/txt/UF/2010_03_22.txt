New Bright Futures plans hurt minorities
The legislation would raise SAT score requirements
By MATT HARRINGER
Alligator Writer
A bill going through the Florida state
Legislature amending Bright Futures
scholarship requirements may dispropor-
tionately cut opportunities for minority
students.
In 1997 Bright Futures cost $70 mil-
lion, last year it cost $429 million. And in
an effort to keep the program solvent, the
Senate Higher Education Appropriations
Committee passed Senate Bill 1344 in a
Friday vote of 4-1.
The legislation would raise scholarship
requirements for SAT scores.
By 2014, the requirements would in-
crease 20 points to 1290 for the Academic
Scholar award.
The legislation would add 80 points to
the 1050 required for the Medallion Schol-ar award.
The higher score requirements would
save the state an estimated $8 million
in 2013 and $100 million by 2018, but 30
percent fewer students would qualify for
scholarships, according to the Office of
Program Policy Analysis and Govern-
ment.
The bill would have the largest effect on
minority students.
Up to about 49 percent of African
American students and 37 percent of His-
panic students who now qualify for Bright
Futures would not qualify for the scholar-
ship award in 2014 based on current test
scores.
Democratic Sen. Dan Gelber, of Miami
Gardens, was the only senator to vote
against the bill.
"The economy has created a huge in-
crease of Floridians who want higher ed-ucation," Gelber said. "I don't think they
should be stiff aimed."
Gelber said the new rules were long-
term changes for short-term budget prob-
lems, and instead of cutting the scholar-
ship the state should consider closing tax
loopholes.
"There are plenty of places we can go to
find money, and I think the priority has to
be education," Gelber said.
Special In addition to tougher qual-
Report ifications, the bill would limit
the length of time students
can use the scholarship from 7
years to 4 years.
It would also end scholarship restora-
tion if a student loses it for academic rea-
sons.
According to UF spokesman Steve Or-
lando, the proposed tougher Bright Fu-
tures requirements probably wouldn't af-fect future UF students due to the fact that
most UF students already have the higher
SAT scores.
Currently 95 percent of freshman and
77 percent of all undergraduate students
at UF have Bright Future scholarships, ac-
cording to Orlando.
In addition to the scholarship changes,
the bill also would allow UF to implement
block differential tuition, which would
charge full-time students the same tuition
rate regardless of how many credits they
enroll in.
According to Orlando, a block tuition
rate would encourage students to gradu-
ate more quickly and increase revenue for
the school.
The committee's bill analysis estimated
block tuition would generate more than
$2 million in the first year of implementa-
tion.
The legislation must pass two more
committees before coming to a full Senate
vote.
AROUND GAINESVILLE
10,000 welcome spring
By MEG WAGNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
A weekend's worth of rain and
shine welcomed garden enthusiasts at
the 20th annual Spring Garden Festi-
val as about 10,000 flocked to the Ka-
napaha Botanical Gardens to celebrate
the start of the spring season.
The first festival was held in 1991
and featured 116 booths. This year's
festival included about 200 vendors,
from local artists showing crafts to
nurseries selling plants.
"It's a very diverse group of ven-
dors, but we all pull together for one
common cause," said Marion Sproul,
chairwoman of the festival commit-
tee.
In an effort to promote green liv-
ing, the festival teamed up with the
Alachua County Office of Waste Al-
ternatives to create a compost of all
food waste collected at the event.
"It's important to educate folks
so we're not putting everything in a
landfill," said Jenny Seitz, public edu-
cation coordinator for the Office ofWaste Alternatives.
Festival organizers also put strict
limits on food vendors as a means of
minimizing the festival's environmen-
tal impact.
"It's a very diverse group of
vendors, but we all pull togeth-
er for one common cause."
Marion Sproul
chairwoman of the festival committee
"We don't allow Styrofoam; we
don't allow straws," Sproul said. "We
encourage them to use recyclable pa-
per goods."
Two stages were also set up as ven-
ues for live entertainment, and visi-
tors bid on various plants and crafts
during live and silent auctions.
Don Goodman, director of the Ka-
napaha Botanical Gardens, said the
event honors the spring season and its
significance.
"This festival is a celebration of the
beginning of the gardening season,"
he said.

Show helps Haiti relief
0 GATORS UNITED FOR HAITI
HAS RAISED $32K SO FAR.
BY CJ PRUNER
Alligator Staff Writer
When the lights dimmed in the
Reitz Union Rion Ballroom Friday,
Mallory Zuckerman couldn't help
but feel a little nervous.
As the first act took the stage and
the audience of about 150 people
clapped, Zuckerman, an emcee for
the Gators United for Haiti talent
show, knew it was going to be a
good night.
According to Gators United for
Haiti president Sky Georges, the
group has raised about $32,000
since it was formed in January.
It hopes to raise $50,000 by April
7, Georges said. If the group raises
$50,000, the University Athletic As-
sociation plans to match this dona-
tion.
The talent show featured sing-
ing, dancing and improv perfor-
mances.
For the final act, David "Benji"Kuriakose of Built to be Broken, a
band based out of Orlando, gave a
special acoustic performance.
Zuckerman, who served as one
of the event's emcee's and per-
formed with her a cappella group,
No Southern Accent, was pleased
with how the show turned out.
"Everything came together
beautifully," said Zuckerman, who
spent four months planning the
show. "It's a testament to how rich
the arts community is at UF."
Admission to the event was free,
although donations
Haiti were encouraged.Relief Georges said he was
satisfied with Friday's
show, but there is much more work
left to be done.
"My thing is that I want people
to see the urgency there," he said.
"People are still suffering."
Cody Sumerix, a psychology
sophomore who also served as an
emcee, agreed.
"Despite the fact that [Haiti vic-
tims] aren't on the front page of the
media doesn't mean [they're] still
not close to people's hearts," he
said.Students trade rights for food
By ANDREW WYZAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
The Plaza of the Americas was a battle-
ground for democracy Friday as students
clashed with dictators during the second an-
nual First Amendment Free Food Festival.
About 300 people participated in the festi-
val, sponsored by the Society of Professional
Journalists. It offered free food to students who
signed away their First Amendment rights.
The First Amendment rights include free-
dom of speech, freedom of assembly, freedom
of religion, freedom of the press and freedom
to petition the government.
SPJ fenced off a part of the plaza to create its
own mock-dictatorship. Students who broke
the rules and exercised their rights were yelled
at or put in jail.
"The whole idea behind this event is to
educate people about their First Amendment
rights and how important they are in their dai-
ly lives," said April Dudash, president of the
UF chapter of SPJ.
Dudash said SPJ spent about $350 on food
and received donations from sponsors, includ-ing The Gelato Company and Harvest Thyme
Cafe.
Participating students were allowed their
fill of pizza, chicken, bagels, soda and sand-
wiches.
"I think this is really good training for
those who want to be a dominatrix."
Chelsea Fitzgerald
UF sophomore
Chelsea Fitzgerald, a UF sophomore, was
sent to jail after being accused of talking in the
Dictator's Lounge, a spot reserved for favorite
participants who followed the rules.
"I think this is really good training for those
who want to be a dominatrix," Fitzgerald said,
describing the SPJ members who were acting
as the dictators.
Destinie Buchman, an anthropology junior
who was watching from the outside, was less
than amused at her peers.
"I think it's pretty sad that students would
sign away their rights for free food," Buchman
said

ETHE GROUP PERFORMED
COMEDY FOR 12 HOURS.
By STEPHANIE RAMIREZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
Theatre Strike Force worked
around the clock at Orange and
Brew on Friday, delivering improv
from noon to midnight.
The marathon, which was also
presented by RUB Entertainment,
raised about $1,000 for the Theatre
Strike Force Relay for Life Team.
TSF has already raised $4,500 for
Relay for Life from previous fund-
raisers.
Kaylyn Brickey, a zoology junior
and the TSF philanthropy chair-
woman, said the majority of the
money was raised during the last
two hours of improv.
"The audience was really respon-
sive," Brickey said. "It was a fun
time for all of us. It was almost like
recess, but for 12 hours."
Online viewers also had a chance
to enjoy the show.
For the first time in the show's
five-year history, TSF broadcasted
the marathon through a Web cam
on Ustream.tv, a live video-stream-
ing Web site.
Students watching the show on-
line could comment and chat with
one another.
Brickey said the actors wanted to
give back to people in the audience.
"It makes it fun for the audience
to see us make it up on the spot af-
ter we've been doing it for so many
hours," Brickey said.

Mayor candidates
discuss outcome,
plan for election
By CJ PRUNER
Alligator Staff Writer
With the run-off for Gainesville mayor's seat three weeks
away, both candidates aren't wasting any time mobilizing forc-
es for one last round in the political arena.
After narrowing down the field of mayoral candidates from
five to two last week, Gainesville residents will choose between
City Commissioner Craig Lowe and businessman Don Marsh
in the April 13 run-off.
Lowe, who received 40.13 percent of the vote, failed to se-
cure the 50-percent-plus-one majority required for nomina-
tion.
But a crucial factor in securing the nomination for Gainesville
mayor may lie with those who didn't make the cut.
The candidates are eying the 2,523 votes Monica Leadon
Cooper, who finished in third place, picked up in last week's
election. At this time, Cooper has not endorsed either Lowe or
Marsh.
Richard Selwach, who finished fourth, gave his support to
Marsh while Ozzy Angulo, who finished last, endorsed Lowe.
"I got a chance to speak to (Lowe) about the issues that affect
our community," he said. "I realized we had the same views
on a lot of the issues, just a different avenue for approaching
them," Angulo said.
"I'm the same candidate that I was in the first
election. I'm going to put it into the hands of
the voters. I'll make the case for a positive fu-
ture where we protect our neighborhoods and
environment, attract economic development
and ensure that everyone is treated fairly."
Craig Lowe
mayoral candidate
Lowe attributed his success to his campaign staff and vol-
unteers, who worked until 15 minutes before the polls closed
on election day to secure votes.
"The people who work on my campaign are wonderful," he
said. "I couldn't be more satisfied."
Despite his favorable outcome last Tuesday, Lowe said he
will continue to campaign with the same vigor as before.
"I'm the same candidate that I was in the first election .I'm
going to put it into the hands of the voters," he said. "I'll make
the case for a positive future where we protect our neighbor-
hoods and environment, attract economic development and
ensure that everyone is treated fairly."
Marsh, who finished nearly 11 percent behind Lowe, said
that the key to convince people that he should be Gainesville's
next mayor is to illustrate the danger of the Cabot-Koppers Su-
perfund site and the potential biomass plant.
"I'm trying to mobilize people who are afraid of being poi-
soned," Marsh said.
Althoughhe admitted that he was "very uncoordinated and
disorganized" in the beginning, Marsh said he feels confident
in the direction of his campaign.
He has a campaign headquarters and said that he has some-
one working on trying to get more student support, although
he declined to elaborate.
"I don't wan't to give up any ground," Marsh said. "You
don't know what will make the difference."
While some view the race from a partisan perspective 
-
Lowe maintains a liberal platform and Marsh has a strong
backing from conservatives -both candidates emphasized
that they are after all people, regardless of political party.
"Partisan politics only serve as a smoke screen," Marsh said.
"This [election] goes beyond partisan politics."

Students win cruise at club fundraiser for Haiti
The field day raised $175 for Gators United for Haiti
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Writer
They ran relay races, played tug-of-war
and won a two-day cruise to the Bahamas.
During the UF Family, Youth and Com-
munity Sciences Club's Field Day for Haiti
on Saturday, two teams of seven students
competed in elementary school games to
earn points.The team known as the USA Ski Team
earned the most points, and each student
on the team won a cruise, which were do-
nated to the club.
The field day raised $175 for Gators
United for Haiti, bringing the FYCS Club's
total donations from this semester to
$451.26.
Rachel Moscato, the FYCS Club presi-
dent, said she was pleased with the re-sults.
"It kind of took everybody back to the
third grade," said Moscato, a family, youth
and community sciences se-
On nior. "It was a blast."
CampUS Family, youth and com-
munity sciences junior
Corinne Oliphant, who won an iPod in a
raffle, said the turnout wasn't overwhelm-
ing, but it was fun to have a smaller groupdedicated to the cause.
"It actually got quite competitive," she
said.
Bryan Tobin, a family, youth and com-
munity sciences junior and a USA Ski
Team member, said it was good to remind
people of the effects of the disaster because
the issue still needs attention.
He said his team was looking forward
to its Bahamian get-away.
"As a ski team, we're not really used to
sun, but we'll try it," he said.

100 witches, wizards
gather at Hume Hall
Steven Salpeter, Gator Tea Society president, predicts his subject's future by reading tea leaves from
the bottom of a cup at Harry Potter Day, an event held by the Student Honors Organization Sunday.By ERICA COOK
Alligator Contributing Writer
Students swapped Gators gear
for wizard robes and magic wands
as Hume Hall transformed into Hog-
warts School of Witchcraft and Wiz-
ardry on Sunday.
About 100 students attended
the Student Honors Organization's
Harry Potter Day, playing Quidditch
with the UF Quidditch team and join-
ing in tea leaf readings sponsored by
the Gator Tea Society.
They made wands, participated
in palm and tarot card readings and
played wizard chess.
Free popcorn and snow cones
were also available for hungry witch-
es and wizards, and Theatre Strike
Force performed an improv show infront of Hume Commons at 7:30 p.m.
Before students could participate,
they had to sign a liability waiver and
take a personality quiz so they could
be put into one of the four houses:
Slytherin, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw or
Hufflepuff.
Sierra Seaman, the president of the
Student Honors Organization, said
the rain led some events to be can-
celed, but the event still had a good
turnout.
"There were no wizard duels or
broom races due to the rain," Seaman
said.
The Student Honors Organization
executive board had one main goal
for putting together the Harry Potter
Day.
"We just wanted to entertain our
residents and the entire honors com-
munity," Seaman said.

Breaking Ground
Health care bill passage
marks important step
We made history last night.WAfter months of heated debate, cutthroat haggling
and hardcore campaigning, the U.S. House of Repre-
sentatives passed a comprehensive health care bill that will turn
around the industry and make it easier and more affordable for
millions of Americans to be insured.
Important things the bill will accomplish:
Those who are happily insured can keep their plans.
People with pre-existing conditions can't be discriminated
against, and companies can't drop you for being sick.
People who can't afford health care will get Medicaid or re-
ceive a subsidy to help them.
Young people will be allowed to stay on their parents' plans
until age 26, up from the current limit of age 22.
Small business owners will receive tax credits to help them
pay for premiums.
The gap in prescription drug coverage for Medicare benefi-
ciaries will gradually narrow until it's eliminated in 2020.
An "exchange" platform will be created to help people
search for plans and promote competition between insurers.
Companies with more than 50 people will be required to of-
fer insurance or be fined.
All of these things make the struggle and the bill's flaws
worth it. What many people -cough TeaPartiers cough -re-
fuse to acKnowledge is that the system is rotting, and we need
to clean it up.
The bill isn't perfect. It's not a magical cure for everything
that's wrong with America or even everything that's wrong
with the health care system. It won't be cheap, and it won't be
easy. But that's OK. The fact is people are dying for no other
reason than they can't afford to be treated, and any way you
look at it, that's wrong.
Party in the U.S.A
he Tea Party Move-ment has been causing
controversy since its
formation in 2009 to its orga-
nization of Saturday's protest
where racial slurs and epi-
thets were screamed at House
Democrats.
Finally they seem to
have met their match.
We were glad to see The Cof-
fee Party, the alternative to the
The Tea Party, was not merely
another screaming band of
protesters with beliefs on the
opposite side of the political
spectrum, but a group of peo-
ple who wish to "reinvigorate
the public sphere, drawing
from diverse backgrounds
and diverse perspectives."
The Coffee Party is about
working toward a general
understanding of each other's
perspectives and ideas while
hoping to help spread the
knowledge that our govern-ment is "not the enemy of the
people, but the expression of
our collective will."
The Coffee Party hopes to
meet its goals, like steering the
government in the direction
of the needs of the people and
not the needs of corporations,
by creating an environment
where different individuals
can learn from each other and
work together.
In a time when most politi-
cal organizations seem only to
be willing to collaborate with
like minds, this comes as a
breath of fresh air.
Instead of screaming
names or mailing teabags to
the White House like its al-
ternative group, The Coffee
Party encourages open dis-
course, diversity, and, above
all, "deliberation guided by
reason."
We couldn't be more
thrilled.

I'wt 2 W7% 1 0 u -Y 1111:
Lawyers in 9/Il case embody America
he class-action lawsuit against the city of New Yorkconcerning the ground zero response and cleanup ef-
fort suffered another setback last week. U.S. District
Judge Alvin Hellerstein handed down a decision stating the
lawsuit's roughly $600 million settlement, filed on behalf of
about more than 10,000 ailing first responders and workers
who searched for survivors and cleared the wreckage after
the Sept. 11 attacks, would be inadequate. He went further
to delineate the settlement's convoluted compensation al-
lotment system and grossly excessive attorney fees as rea-
sons for his recommendation to restructure the settlement.
Hellerstein maintained the compensation paled in compari-
son to the effort displayed, hazardous conditions endured
and compensation truly deserved by the plaintiffs, whom
he made a point to refer to as heroes.
Now, I'm not for throwing the h-word around willy-nil-
ly, and indeed, use of the word "hero" has been exercised
to such an extent as to render it virtually useless, having
gone so far as to become a verbal Band-Aid applied to any-
one who gets the raw end of an unpalatable scenario (see:
any victim featured on "Nancy Grace" or HLN in general).
Does this mean our heroes are fewer and farther between
than we typically recognize or that some of them are unde-
serving or, more pertinently, that the plaintiffs in this law-
suit are being aggrandized?
Concerning the latter, it's always difficult to assess the
actions of those exclusively involved in emergencies as be-
ing purveyors of herodom or simply doing their jobs. In
this instance, it seems Hellerstein drank a little too much of
his own Kool-Aid, because as far as I'm concerned, volun-
teers notwithstanding, you aren't a hero just for adhering to
your job description and happening to get poisoned. You
are, however, entitled to suitable sums of money. Interest-
ingly enough, it seems Hellerstein failed to recognize and
acknowledge, and in fact skipped right over, the ones who
might be considered the real heroes in this situation: the
lawyers.Ryan Spencer
Ietters@alligator orgToo long have these heroes' deeds
sat idle and unsung; too often are they
forced to retreat to the isolation of the
penthouse suites that cap their ivory
office towers to be relegated to local
slot advertising or over-encroaching
highway billboards, to hide behind
the veils of non-lawyer spokespeople,
to stand before volume-redundant li-
braries and to wear ridiculous cow-
boy hats, though it's painfully obvious they've never even
fed a horse, much less ridden one. Well, this nonsense stops
with me; it's time I shine a light on their heroics.
Faced with perhaps the most muddled, tangled wreck-
age of a case seen in recent years, these litigators rummaged
through the piles, nay, the heaping rubble of paperworknec-
essary to rescue and salvage sums of compensation for their
clients -often braving the confines of poorly ventilated,
if lavishly adorned, conference rooms and having to work
through the pain of tendinitis or the discomfort of an occa-
sionally malfunctioning Aeron chair -only to be compen-
sated themselves with a mere 40 percent of said settlement.
That's less than $250 million, folks. How are they going to
compete with financial executives for top shyster miscre-
ants of New York City with chump change like that?
As if working for peanuts wasn't bad enough, here
comes Hellerstein (and, in all likelihood, everyone aware
of the settlement's structure) not pulling any punches in
saying their compensation is ridiculous or unwarranted. Is
there anything ridiculous about being confronted with the
chaos of such a case and, out of the ruins, being able to erect
a monumental edifice of billable hours shining like a beacon
of hope for generations (of lawyers) to come? That doesn't
sound ridiculous to me; it sounds downright American.

Letters to the Editor
Student Alliance party thanks student
voters for passing resolution
I want to publicly thank several student
senators who reached across party lines
Tuesday night to help pass the Student Al-
liance's resolution calling for a grand jury
investigation into the shooting of UF gradu-
ate student Kofi Adu-Brempong. The Unite
Party's leadership repeatedly tried to make
amendments to the bill that would have wa-
tered it down to the point of meaningless-
ness, even over objections from numerous
members of the public who came out to sup-
port the resolution.
Fortunately, a number of Unite Party
senators recognized the injustice of allowing
this tragedy to be swept under the rug, and
they made the almost unprecedented move
of voting with the Student Alliance minority
against these amendments. Thanks to them,
the resolution passed with almost all of itsoriginal wording. The list of these senators
is too long to include here, but I strongly en-
courage those who are interested to go to the
third floor of the Reitz Union and ask to see
the voting records.
Standing up against the leadership of
one's own party takes a lot of guts, especially
when the party has a history of using strong-
arm tactics to silence internal dissent. I ap-
plaud these individuals for taking a stand for
what's right even in the face of harsh retribu-
tion, and I hope the Unite Party's leadership
will respect their right to vote with their con-
sciences.
In Student Government, letting politics
get in the way of representing students is al-
most a way of life. Perhaps this is a sign that
those who would perpetuate that tradition
are, at long last, about to be shown the door.
Graham Clark
CLAS Senator (Student Alliance party)Investigation not sufficient
The Coalition Against Police Brutality
does not share the Editorial Board's faith in
Margolis, Healy & Associates.
The firm is not an independent investi-
gative unit. Margolis, Healy & Associates is
made up of ex-police and military personnel,
and its founder is trained in counterterror-
ism from Israel.
We went more than 25 years without a
shooting on campus. We feel the shooting
of UF graduate student Kofi Adu-Brempong
was due in part to the militarization of our
campus. We are students, not terrorists.
Treat us as such. We agree there needs to be
an investigation and are pleased the Edito-
rial Board supports the move toward a grand
jury.
However, we are not pleased that the Al-
ligator misquoted us on the firing of officer
Smith. We are calling for the suspension ofofficer Keith Smith and termination only if
the independent investigation suggests that's
necessary. We share your curiosity about
why Smith was hired by UPD to begin with
and that he does not deserve paid leave.
As for the charges on Kofi: We feel these
could be used against him as a bargaining
tool not to pursue a civil case. A judge has
determined there is enough evidence to pur-
sue charges, but the administration can still
advocate his innocence.
We understand the administration does
not have the power to give us our demands,
but they can support our cause. We would
like letters of endorsement and encourage-
ment from the Board of Trustees and the ad-
ministration.
This will show that not only the Student
Body but the administration wants justice for
Kofi.

Don't get me wrong -this weather is a huge improvement
from the chilly, atmospheric afterbirth that is Gainesville's
winter. Hell, if Al Gore lived here he would be standing on a
heap of emaciated Hare Krishnas, spraying aerosol cans at the
heavens in a feeble attempt to chase away the rain-entrenched
cold weather that bordered on "kill yourself" and "kill yourself
slowly."
But along with springtime comes things that will make your
retinas burn like chlamydia: pollen, sunlight and the resurrec-
tion of frat-star attire.
Before you bro-bomb my phone or strangle an innocent by-
stander with Croakies, this is not a disgruntled GDI taking a

Telu Patel checks on a chickpea curry at the annual India Fest on Saturday at Santa Fe
College's gymnasium.ON CAMPUS
India Fest draws 2,000
to Santa Fe College
By MATT HARRINGER
Alligator Writer
Subhajit Sengupta was standing on-
stage in front of about 200 people. He was
singing a song half the crowd couldn't
understand, but they tapped their feet to
the beat anyway.
The other half of the crowd in the San-
ta Fe College gymnasium at the Jai Ho In-
dia Fest on Saturday knew the song well;
"Yeh Dil Na Hota Bechchara," from the
1967 movie "Jewel Thief," is a Bollywood
classic.
The festival, which attracted more
than 2,000 people, represented one goal
of the India Culture & Education Center's
mission: to share the Indian culture with
outsiders.
Its other mission is to serve those like
Sengupta in Gainesville's Indian commu-
nity.
India Fest is the center's biggest fund-"I like the singing and dancing 
-
the cultural part."
Dimitri Blondel
UF graduate student
raiser and provides the funds to help Indi-
an immigrants lost in American culture.
Volunteers from the Indian Cultural
and Education Center worked with stu-
dents from Eastside High School's culi-
nary program to serve more than 10 dif-
ferent authentic Indian dishes.
They had all the staples: Samosas,
chutney and chicken curry.
In the parking lot adjacent to the gym,
Dimitri Blondel, a non-Indian UF gradu-
ate student, was shoveling food from a
Styrofoam plate into his mouth with a
plastic fork.
"I like the singing and dancing -the
cultural part," he said.
Then he gave away the real reason he
was there: "I love the Indian food."

Maddox sparks offense with homer to sweep MSU
UF freshman designated hitter Austin Maddox hits a three-run homer in the
bottom of the eighth inning during the Gators' 4-1 win against Mississippi
State at McKethan Stadium on Sunday.0 STARTER HUDSON RANDALL AL-
LOWED JUST ONE RUN IN 5.1 INNINGS.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator org
With the rain pouring down in the eighth in-
ning of a tied game, Austin Maddox wiped the
brim of his batting helmet and waited until he
saw the pitch he liked.
After fouling off five balls in a nine-pitch at-
bat, the freshman stayed back and sent a slider
over the right-field fence to break the tie.
Maddox's three-run homer gave No. 6 Flori-
da (16-3, 3-0 Southeastern Conference) the sepa-
ration it needed in a 4-1 victory over Mississippi
State (11-9, 0-3 SEC) to clinch the series sweep
on Sunday.
"I felt more comfortable after seeing more
pitches," Maddox said. "I got up there, battled,
got a good pitch and put a good swing on it."
Before Maddox's blast, Florida struggled to
get anything going offensively.
After scoring one in the second inning off
a single from left fielder Jonathan Pigott, the
Gators could only manage one hit until the
three-run eighth inning.Bulldogs reliever Caleb Reed came in for
starter Nick Routt in the third and only gave
up one run and one hit in 5.1 innings until Ben
Bracewell was called onto the mound in the
eighth and gave up the round-tripper to Mad-
dox.
"Their relief pitcher (Reed) did a nice job,"
UF coach Kevin O'Sullivan said. "He's got a
different arm slot and it's a little funky, and he
threw a lot of off-speed pitches in fastball counts
which is why he accounted for a lot of lazy fly-
ball outs."
With the bats quiet for most of the game,
freshman pitcher Hudson Randall kept Florida
in the game. In his first SEC start, he only al-
lowed one run in 5.1 innings while striking out
five hitters.
Following the solo home run and a single
he gave up in the second, Randall settled down
and didn't allow a hit through his next three in-
nings.
"I think he's been throwing the ball good,"
O'Sullivan said. "He probably wants back that
1-0 pitch to Thigpen, but other than that for him
to last until the sixth inning and only give up one
run -I thought he was outstanding."
Mississippi State had its fair share of oppor-

UF WOMEN'S SWIMMING AND DIVING
Gators rally to win NCAA title
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
Sitting in fourth place with two events
left at the Women's NCAA Swimming
Championships, Florida's hopes of a na-
tional title looked bleak.
But a solid performance in the platform
competition vaulted the Gators into the
lead, and a third-place finish in the 400-yard
freestyle relay clinched UF's first national
championship since 1982 in West Lafayette,
Ind.
"This was a Cinderella weekend for us,"
UF coach Gregg Troy said. "I just can't say
enough. We kept focus on what we wanted
to do. It feels great."
The Gators finished with 382 points -
2.5 more than second-place Stanford -and
12 All-Americans, earning Troy the 2010
NCAA Women's Coach of the Year Award.
Florida entered the final day of competi-
tion in fifth place, but after divers Kara Sala-
mone and Monica Dodson finished third
and eighth in the platform competition, the
Gators jumped into first place over Stan-
ford, Arizona, Georgia and California.
"We thought that if we got one diver in
the championships and one in the finals, we
would be set up well for a third-place team
finish," diving coach Donnie Craine said."When both Kara and Monica made the
championship, we knew if it all panned out
right, we would have a shot at first."
In the final event, the 400-yard freestyle
relay, the squad of Liz Kemp, Gemma Spof-
forth, Shara Stafford and Jamie Bohunicky
swam a time of 3:13.43. The time was good
enough to secure a UF record, third-place
finish and NCAA Championship.
Stanford (379.5), California (363), Ari-
zona (359.5) and Georgia
(342.5) rounded out the
top five team finishers.
"This day was an emo-
tional rollercoaster," Spof-
forth said. "We didn't re-
ally, honestly, think we
were going to win, and to
come out with such a vic-
tory is a great feeling."
Spofforth failed in her quest to become
the first four-time winner of the 200-yard
backstroke, but she ended her decorated
career with seven national titles, including
this year's 100-yard backstroke and 200-
yard freestyle.
"There were lots of tears, but I have put
them all behind me because to win this title
with all of my teammates is much more
amazing and important to me than an indi-
vidual title," Spofforth said.Dunlap has more to prove
bout an hour after show-ing NFL teams why they
should covet him at UF's
Pro Scout Day last Wednesday, for-
mer Gators defensive end Carlos
Dunlap flashed a glimpse of why
they should hesitate to throw mil-
lions of dollars his way.
Dunlap impressed during his
workout, improving on all his times
and reps from the NFL Combine,
but when asked by reporters about
whether character questions have
affected his draft stock, Dunlap's
answer included this line: "I don't
want to sound cocky or confident,
but I'm the humblest guy there is."
Hearing the ever-polite Dunlap
brag about being humble was fun-
ny and even endearing, but it also
highlighted the flaw that seems to
have some on the fence about the
6-foot-6, 290-pounder: immaturity.
Dunlap notched 18.5 sacks dur-
ing the last two seasons against
frequent double teams, but his DUI
arrest in December and questions
about his work ethic have plaguedhis reputation.
It's not that
Dunlap isn't
a nice guy,
he just has to
prove he has a
killer instinct
McCallin' It and is will-Like I See Ita d i wl-
mmccaIl@aIIigatororg ing to work to
reach his full
potential.
"Physically, he's in the elite cat-
egory in terms of the gifts he has,"
ESPN analyst Todd McShay said.
"He's freakish physically, it's just a
matter of maturity level and grow-
ing up.
"If he grows up in a hurry, real-
izes the gifts he has, puts the time
in and wants to take advantage of
them, he could have a special career
in the NFL."
It's clear Dunlap knows about
these concerns, as he went out of
his way to address them, probably
on the advice of his agent, Todd
France.

39.575 to lead No. 5 Florida (9-2, 5-1 Southeastern Confer-
ence) to a 197.55-196.5 win over Utah, tying the season-
high total the team posted two weeks ago against North
Carolina and Ball State.
"I decided to be a bit greedy," King said of her perfor-
mance.
"It just feels like everything to do with col-
lege gymnastics. is actually finally just
coming together and getting in my head."

She scored a 9.9 on her first three events (vault, bars
and beam), all of which coach Rhonda Faehn said were
among King's best-preformed routines of the season.
"It just feels like everything to do with college gym-
nastics. is actually finally just coming together and get-
ting in my head," King said.
It couldn't have come at a better time for the Gators,
who head into next week's SEC Championships coming
off two of their best outings of the year.
But things weren't just clicking for King on Friday.
On bars, the Gators scored a season-high 49.525, the
first five routines by Florida's gymnasts set or tied col-
legiate bests on the event.
"It was almost automatic, like it was icing on the cake,"
Faehn said. "When everybody does that it's almost kind
of silly, because you don't expect everybody to do amaz-
ing. You expect one or two or three girls and then a couple
of good ones. But for everyone to do it, we kind of look at
each other and laugh a little bit."
Among the gymnasts who scored a collegiate best was
Amanda Castillo, who registered a 9.95 in her final home
meet in the O'Connell Center. It was a routine that Faehn
described as one of the best of Castillo's career at Florida.

Florida optimistic for next season
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
OKLAHOMA CITY -Despite
Florida's 99-92 double-overtime loss
to BYU, the Gators' future still looks
bright.
UF (21-13) achieved its goal of re-
turning to the NCAA Tournament for
the first time since 2007, putting two
disappointing years behind it and
ushering in what the team hopes is a
new era of success.
"I think coming out here and get-
ting a taste of this is really going to
help us for next year," junior forward
Chandler Parsons said. "Coming back
tougher and stronger and hardened
from our experience this year, as well
as improving our individual skills
and chemistry."
Part of the reason Parsons can be
so optimistic is that the Gators will
seemingly keep most of their roster
intact for the first time since the 2006-
07 season.
Barring transfers, or someone un-
expectedly leaving for a pro career,
UF will only lose senior Dan Werner.
Coaches and teammates praise
Werner's work ethic and toughness,
and he averaged 27.7 minutes per
game this year. But his statistical pro-
duction (4.6 points, 4.1 rebounds, 33
percent shooting) won't be hard to
replace.
Aside from Werner, the rest of the
Gators' eight-man rotation should be
set to return -a thrilling prospect for
coach Billy Donovan.
"Looking at what we've got com-
ing back, I'm excited about the nucle-
us of guys," Donovan said. "I've got
to try to find a way to add some depth
to our team. I think that's going to be
important."
The lack of depth in the backcourt
was made all too apparent at the end
of UF's first-round loss to BYU, and
Donovan will hit the recruiting trail
hard to attempt to bring in another
guard.
Point guard Brandon Knight, the
nation's top recruit according to Ri-
vals.com, has Florida as one of his
top-five choices, but Donovan will
be competing to bring in Knight with
Southeastern Conference rival Ken-
tucky.
If Knight commits elsewhere,
Donovan will look to sign another
ballhandler with the team's one re-
mairing scholarship, or he will once
again have to rely on guards Erving
Walker, Kenny Boynton, Ray Ship-
man and maybe even Rod Tishman,Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF guard Kenny Boynton will be one of the main players the Gators are
counting on to improve upon this season in 2010-2011.
who was a non-factor in his first year.
Keeping those players may be a
tough task, however, as UF has lost
10 players to other schools since the
2003-04 season.
"I would expect everyone else to
be back, but you never know," Walk-
er said. "Hopefully we do."
The Gators have already signed
two recruits for next season who
should fill gaps in the frontcourt:
Casey Prather, a 6-foot-5 small for-
ward from Jackson, Tenn., and Patric
Young, a 6-foot-8 center from Jack-
sonville.
If those two can contribute, whilethe rest of UF's roster remains intact
and some of the returning players
improve -Donovan singled out for-
ward Erik Murphy, who showed po-
tential in his freshman season -the
Gators could be on their way to mak-
ing NCAA Tournament appearances
a regular occurrence again.
"I think we come back next year
with a lot of experience, and I think
we'll come back more of a hungrier
team," Boynton said. "With this loss,
we'll only build on it for next year and
hope we get back to the NCAA Tour-
nament again and make some more
noise."
MIKE, from page 14_
He made several comments
about "never settling," "improv-
ing" and "competition," and he
offered a pretty heartfelt state-
ment about the DUI that kept him
out of Florida's loss to Alabama
in the Southeastern Conference
Championship.
"That was one of the worst
times of my life," Dunlap said."I never want to go through it or
put anyone else through it again.
I'm still dealing with it today
with my probation and knowing
I could possibly have made a dif-
ference in the game.
"It might not even have been
making a play, maybe just dis-
rupting a play that might have
helped change the game or helped
my teammates. That's something
I'm going to live with, being the
competitor I am, and that's some-thing I have to deal with."
The Carolina Panthers -who
Dunlap, a South Carolina native,
has said several times would be
his ideal team -showed the
most interest at Pro Day. Dunlap
held a half-hour workout with
Panthers defensive line coach
Brian Baker, and Carolina could
use a defensive end after losing
Julius Peppers to the Bears and a
$91.5 million contract earlier this
month.Baker mostly focused on test-
ing Dunlap's flexibility and see-
ing how he takes instructions,
and he said Dunlap has already
proven himself in the most cru-
cial area, on game film.
Baker also said the DUI arrest
isn't a huge issue.
"As long as a guy is a good guy
-and I don't think a DUI makes
him a bad guy, I think he made
a bad decision," Baker said. "If a
guy is a good guy, I'm okay withhim. If a guy is a turd, I don't like
him."
Dunlap isn't a turd, but he still
has something to prove.
He's probably a good fit for
the Panthers, whose first pick
is midway through the second
round, but if he wants the early
first-round slot draft gurus like
Mel Kiper predicted he'd have
before this season, he needs to
show he's also the most grown-
up guy there is.

Improved defense keys another blowout win for UF
0 ASHLEY BRUNS LED THE
GATORS WITH SIX GOALS.
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
After Florida coach Amanda
O'Leary's constant talk about her
defense working together as a unit
rather than as individuals, UF (5-
3, 0-1 American Lacrosse Confer-
ence) has stepped up its play in
the last two games, allowing just
six goals.
In the most recent, a physical
15-3 win over New Hampshire
(4-3) on Saturday, the Gators com-
pleted 20 of 22 clears, allowed its
opponent just 11 shots and didn't
offer New Hampshire any free-
position shots.
Attacker Ashley Bruns over-
came a few checks to the head to
lead UF with six goals and three
assists while midfielder Colby
Rhea added three scores and at-
tacker Caroline Cochran had two.
The match got off to a slow
start, as Florida scored the first
goal of the match at 22:11 remain-
ing in the first half and then reeled
off the next four scores to take a
commanding 5-0 lead with 8:56
left.
The Wildcats got on the board
about a minute later, and UF led
7-1 at the half.Goalkeeper Cara Canington
said the recent defensive success
has been a result of the team's co-
hesive play.
"We're getting the slides off
balls, and we're all doing our jobs,"
Canington said. "They're giving
me the angles to make those saves,
and it's just all coming together."
To start the second half, Can-
ington gave up two unanswered
goals, allowing the Wildcats to cut
the lead to four. But those were
their last scores, and UF responded
with eight-straight to seal the win.
O'Leary said she was proud
her squad was able to put together
another solid 60 minutes of play as
it did in a 22-3 win against Marist
on Wednesday.
"We knew UNH was a strong
one-on-one team. They like to get
the ball and go to goal," O'Leary
said. "And our players were just
really able to step up and deny the
one-on-ones. We slid the double
early, and we were just really suc-
cessful with it."
In the pregame warm-up, UF
lost one of its most versatile play-
ers, Rachael Zimmerman. The
sophomore suffered a knee injury
and was not on the field during
the game Saturday. The results of
her MRI are not yet known.
O'Leary said it was an impor-
tant loss for the Gators because of
the leadership Zimmerman offers.UF attacker Ashley Bruns scores a goal in the Gators' 15-3 win over New
Gainesville. The freshman scored six goals and added three assists.Steven H. Keys / Alligator Staff

UF WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
Gators' season ends with loss to Hurricanes in WNIT
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@alligator org
Amanda Butler cautioned her team
against the athletic, guard-oriented play
Miami posed.
For the first half of Sunday's game, the
Gators failed to heed that warning.
UF ended its season with a 77-64 second-
round loss in the Women's National Invi-
tation Tournament to UM. Florida trailed
by 11 at the end of a first half where it shot
below 30 percent.
"The first half was just not the way we
play," Butler said. "You're playing a good
opponent on their home floor it's too little,
too late."
The Gators were better offensively in the
second half, shooting 47.2 percent from the
field and making 8 of 19 from three-point
range, but they were never able to get clos-er than eight points.
Miami kept UF out of arms reach with
a strong showing from the free-throw line,
hitting 11 of 14 in the second half.
"We did a horrible job taking care of the
basketball," Butler said. "When we look
at the film, that's the thing we'll be most
disappointed in .It's just how many op-
portunities we gave the ball back to them
to score."
The Gators had 18 turnovers, two fewer
than the Hurricanes, but 13 came in the first
half and it was Miami that took advantage
of the turnovers with 18 second-chance
points and 10 fast-break points to Florida's
four.
UF's overcompensation for Miami's ath-
leticism cost the Gators early.
UM's leading scorers, Shenise Johnson
and Riquna Williams, combined for 38.3
points per game entering Sunday's contest.Through the first half, they accounted for
just eight points. Johnson finished with 19
points, 10 rebounds and eight assists, and
Williams added 15 points. Charmaine Clark
contributed 16 points -almost 10 above her
season average.
UF kept pace with the Hurricanes the
first five minutes of the
game, trading buckets.
A Jennifer George
layup brought the Gators
to within three with 15:01
remaining in the first half,
before a six-plus minute
scoring drought.
Butler Guards Steffi Sorens-
en, Jordan Jones and Lonnika Thompson
were all kept in check by UM's athleticism
in the first period.
The trio had just four points between
them, including a scoreless Sorensen whowas held to just two shots before intermis-
sion.
The Gators shot 29.2 percent in the first
period, and the only shining spot was cen-
ter Azania Stewart who had 11 first-half
points. She finished with a team-high 18
points, six rebounds and four assists.
"Everybody did a good job of recogniz-
ing she was hot," Butler said. "The exciting
thing is we've got her for two more years."
Florida shot and played better in the sec-
ond half -47.2 field-goal percentage and
half as many turnovers as the 'Canes --but
was still overwhelmed by UM's athletes.
Sorensen found her shot and hit 5 of 9
three-pointers after the break and totaled
15. Down 17 points with 15:25 left, UF went
on a 12-4 spurt spanning 2:45. With a tie in
sight, the Hurricanes clamped down and
kept the Gators at bay.
