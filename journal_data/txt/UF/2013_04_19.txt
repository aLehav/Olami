In light of the Boston Marathon bomb-
ings, University Police is requesting mem-
bers of the UF community look out for sus-picious packages or mail.
UF has not received any direct threats, 
but in an email to UF deans, directors and department chairs Thursday, UPD Chief Linda Stump requested  “assistance to re-main vigilant and increase awareness of any suspicious activity/package and/or enve-lope that may arrive in your department.”
UF students, faculty and staff should be 
aware of packages or letters with lumps, bulges, stains, protruding objects or a non-existent return address. They should also look out for packages with handwritten addresses or address labels with fake companies, wrapped in string, that look like they were not weighed by the 
United States Postal Ser-vice or small packages with excessive postage, Stump wrote in the email.
“This was a proactive outreach to those 
who would encounter the thousands of pieces of mail that enter campus,” said UPD spokesman Maj. Brad Barber.
Later, the email was forwarded to cam-
pus residents and parents.
Stump encouraged anyone who sees a 
suspicious package to isolate it and to dial 911 or call UPD at 352-392-1111.
“The safety of everyone in the area of the 
package is our primary concern,” she wrote. “If you think the package is suspicious, it is.”

From posting on social me-
dia to rallying on West Univer-
sity Avenue, UF students in Gainesville are actively show-ing their support for a recount in the Venezuelan presidential election that took place Sun-day.
Miguel Machado, a 21-year-
old UF journalism junior, trav-eled to New Orleans over the weekend to vote at the nearest Venezuelan embassy, but his vote was not recognized.
Ballots recorded outside 
Venezuela were not counted, according to published re-ports.
An announcement made 
Sunday night by Tibisay Lu-cena, the president of Venezu-ela’s National Electoral Coun-cil, declared Nicolas Maduro, a successor picked by the late President Hugo Chavez, the victor with 50.66 percent of the vote.
Henrique Capriles, the op-
posing candidate, received 49.07 percent.
“The country is split in 
half,” Machado said.
Following Sunday’s elec-
tion, Capriles asked for a re-count of the votes.
Andrea Carroz, a 19-year-
old UF journalism sophomore, said she was disappointed by the election results and the way the votes were handled.

Gainesville book lovers can get 
their novel ﬁ  x with the Friends of 
the Library’s Spring Book Sale starting Saturday.
The sale, which beneﬁ  ts the 
Alachua County  Library District, will take place at the Friends of the Library Book House, 430-B N. Main St. The event will go through Wednesday. Saturday’s sale will run from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
The remaining sale days are 
up and running at different times, which can be found on the Friends of the Library website.
Susan Park, membership chair 
of Friends of the Library and a 20-year volunteer with the orga-nization, said with about 500,000 books available in more than 50 categories, the event is a book lover’s dream.
“I always like to see a rush 
of people come in at 9 o’clock in the morning with eager anticipa-tion,” she said. “They all have a book they’re looking for. It’s a wonderful opportunity for any-one who likes books.”
But patrons will ﬁ  nd more 
than just books at the sale, she said. 
Puzzles, computer software 
and framed oil paintings will also be available for purchase. 
The sale’s Collector’s Corner, 
which in previous years housed ﬁ  rst-edition works from authors such as Robert Frost and William Faulkner, will also be open.
Though most books run be-
tween 25 cents and $4, all items drop to half-price Tuesday and down again to 10 cents Wednes-day.
Joan Bearden, former presi-
dent of the organization, said the book sales have raised $2 million for literary projects in Alachua County.
“Our sole purpose is to raise 
money for the library and for oth-er literacy projects,” she said.

Two weeks and $33 million 
stand between an expanded 
Reitz Union and a building ren-ovated for quiet studying.
UF student senators are 
phoning Tallahassee to urge state senators to include UF’s student fees, which will finance the projects, in a bond package.
The package is already sup-
ported by the Florida House of Representatives, but if the Sen-ate doesn’t approve the bonds, funds for the Reitz Union ex-pansion and Newell Hall reno-vations could be cut.
Student Body President Tj 
Villamil said state senators are wary of approving the bonds out of fear it would add to the state debt. But UF has never de-faulted on its loans, he said.
UF secured the $75 million 
Reitz Union expansion in 2012, with $50 million from bonded student fees and $5 million from UF reserves. An expected $20 million would come from the Capital Improvement Trust Fund if the bonds are approved. The Newell Hall renovations would get $13 million.  The fund was created in 
1988 to improve nonacademic student life buildings on cam-pus. It is bonded every four years, which means when stu-dents pay tuition, their money is transferred into bonds to be 
a p p r o v e d by the state Legislature. Then, the 
money com-pounds over time to re-turn a greater investment. The fee costs 
each student $6.76 per credit hour, according to the Univer-sity Bursar’s website.
“We want students to call 
up senators and tell them how important these buildings are to them and how important it is to future Gators,” Villamil said.
Sen. Morgan Vollrath is 
gathering a group of about five senators and Students Party members to take to the phone bank next week.
“It’s a bipartisan issue,” he 
said. “Students will benefit greatly from it.”

From blacktop to full color, the 
area in front of the Florida Museum 
of Natural History will transform into an aromatic wonderland for butterflies and guests.
Just past the makeshift meadow 
of about 140 species of flowers, the museum will hold its first-ever mini BioBlitz.
A BioBlitz is a type of field re-
search where scientists and other volunteers do intensive identifi-cation of all living organisms in a specific area for 24 to 48 hours. The museum’s will last five hours. This is where museum collections begin.
The theme of the museum’s 
second-annual Earth Day celebra-tion, held Saturday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., is From Field to Collection. The second-largest plant sale of the year is open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. today, Saturday and Sunday. The goal of this event is to “increase habitat for pollinators” said Jeff Hansen, coor-dinator of operations and visitor ser-vices for the museum.
The Earth Day celebration is free 
but access to the Titanoboa exhibit and the Butterfly Rainforest is not.
Last year, about 1,600 people 
came out to the celebration, but the museum is prepared for 2,000, said Catherine Carey, the museum’s public programs coordinator.
“We often get caught up in day-
to-day living,” Carey said, “and we forget that we live in habitat.”Florida Museum celebrates Earth Day
◗ THE 5K STARTS AT 9 A.M. ON THE

UF students are holding a 5K Saturday in honor of 
two fallen Gators.
The sixth annual Fallen Heroes 5K will start at 9 a.m. 
on the Commuter Lot. Registration is $25 for UF stu-
dents, and they can register at www.active.com/run-ning/gainesville-fl/6th-annual-fallen-heroes-5k-2013. People can also register the day of the event.
All money will go to the Gainesville Fisher House 
Foundation, which offers shelter and support for mili-tary families during a medical crisis, and the UDT-SEAL Foundation, which financially assists SEALs and their family members. As of press time, 165 people had regis-tered, said Seth Lindstrom, the 5K’s director.
The 21-year-old UF mechanical engineering junior 
said the 5K is in honor of Navy SEAL James Suh and Naval Special Warfare Officer Thomas Fouke, both UF alumni.
“They’re kind of near and dear to our hearts,” Lind-
strom said.
Suh, who graduated from UF in 1999, lost his life dur-
ing a tour in Afghanistan in 2005. Fouke, who graduated in 2006, died in 2012 during training in Virginia because of heart complications.
Fouke’s friend and former UF classmate Joey Be-
nevento said he won’t be able to attend the 5K Saturday but thinks its a great way to honor the fallen men.
“He was a great guy,” Benevento said. “I kind of 
looked up to him.”

Satchel Raye, owner of Satchel’s Pizza, prepares a zero-calorie, stevia-sweet-
ened drink, Stevie Z Cal, on Wednesday afternoon.
ALEX HARRIS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Satchel’s Pizza has offi-
cially canned Pepsi products 
in favor of homemade colas.
Tuesday marked the debut 
of Satchel’s new sodas.
The popular Gainesville 
pizzeria will feature six fla-vors regularly, with one ro-tating every few months.
The options are Lola Cola; 
Steve Z Cal, a zero-calorie, stevia-sweetened soda; Ruby Root Beer; Ginnie Ginger Ale; Lennie Lemon Lime; and lemonade. The rotating fla-vor is Satch Sour, a probiotic, kombucha-brewed tea bever-age.
Satchel Raye, owner of 
Satchel’s, said the idea of making his own soda had been bubbling in his head since 2005, but he wanted to make sure the restaurant was secure before he moved on to other projects.
“I don’t think Coke and 
Pepsi are the best experi-ence,” he said. “I think it’s what people are used to, but I don’t think that it’s necessar-ily the best. I think soda can be so much better.”
He said he wants his 
drinks to help people change their relationship with soda.
The new beverages are 
meant to be enjoyed in mod-eration, Raye added.
“In a way, it becomes more of an experience and less of a habit once you realize that it can be better for you and taste better,” he said.
David Rodriguez, a 
22-year-old UF mechanical engineering senior, said he would be interested in trying Satchel’s original drinks.
“Everyone seems to have 
Coke or Pepsi products. It would be interesting to try something new,” he said. “It seems like they’re made right, unlike the corn syrup-sweetened drinks.”
Raye said for now, his so-
das still need more tweaking. He’s recruited his family and friends to help in the taste-testing process.
“Our sodas are going to 
get better over the next few months,” he said. “I feel like what we have now is not what we’re going to have in three months.”
Satchel’s hopes its homemade sodas will make a splash
About 60 students gathered near UF Monday to rally for a recount
decision was irreversible, Venezu-elans suspected the election had been tampered with.
Carroz has been using Twitter 
and other social media sites to ex-press her concerns about the situa-tion.
“I’ve been ranting like crazy,” 
she said.Carroz has seen pictures online 
of ballot receipts being burned by government officials who support Maduro’s victory.
In a statement released Mon-
day, Sen. Marco Rubio said, “I am troubled by press accounts of fraud and electoral misconduct including uncounted votes.”
He urged the Venezuelan gov-
ernment to conduct a “full and transparent audit of the results.
“The Venezuelan people should 
know that the democracies of the Western Hemisphere are watching the electoral review process closely and will seek to hold accountable any individual determined to have disrupted the peaceful conduct of free and fair elections,” he said.
Maria Carolina Di Bonaventura, 
president of the UF Venezuelan Student Association, said about 60 students gathered Monday on the corner of Southwest 13th Street and West University Avenue to rally in support of a recount.
The organization raised money 
to pay for trips to New Orleans after Hugo Chavez’s death March 5 and the announcement of an election for a new president so local Venezue-lans could vote at the Venezuelan embassy, Di Bonaventura said.
The club provided seven bus 
tickets to students without asking about political affiliation.
Di Bonaventura said she’s seen a 
trend with people in the U.S. asking for a recount.
“If you’ve moved to the United 
States,” she said, “you’re most like-ly not in accordance with the gov-ernment over there.”

A new study suggests the taste 
of beer, instead of the alcohol con-
tent, may be what causes people to drink more, according to Indiana University School of Medicine re-searchers.
UF student Ellen Farley, a 
23-year-old public relations senior, doesn’t even take a sip of beer. In-stead, she drinks wine.
“I really just don’t like beer; not 
even a sip is enjoyable,” she said. “Wine, on the other hand, is some-thing I enjoy, and I tend to drink more of it.”
The study found dopamine, a hormone connected to rewarding activities, is released from the brain after drinking a small amount of al-cohol, and the taste alone is enough to release the hormone.
The results suggest alcoholism 
could be a form of Pavlovian con-ditioning, which pairs a stimulus with a specific response.
“While this study reflects on a 
Pavlovian style of learning, a more thorough investigation of alcohol-ism may suggest that it is acquired by operant conditioning, a form of learning that occurs through conse-quences rather than prior stimuli,” said Chelsea Fleck, a 21-year-old UF post-baccalaureate research as-sistant in behavior analysis.
However, she said the study 
was flawed.
“Without testing the effects of 
nonalcoholic beer,” Fleck said, “it is nearly impossible to conclude that the taste of beer causes continued drinking, which is a shortfall of the research procedures.”Study: Beer’s taste intoxicates drinkers

Multiple UF Jewish or-
ganizations are hosting the 
first-ever Shabbat 1800, and they’re looking to break a record.
The goal is to have more 
than 1,800 students and resi-dents come out at 5:30 p.m. to Flavet Field for a free din-ner to celebrate the Jewish day of rest.
Spencer Greenfeder, the 
event’s coordinator and a 22-year-old UF mechanical engineering senior, said the original idea started at Bing-hamton University in 1994 with Shabbat 1000.
“We were essentially in-
spired by them, but at UF, we have more Jewish students than any other public uni-versity in the country at over 8,500,” Greenfeder said. “We know we can get as many people to participate.”
With a goal of 1,800 peo-
ple, this is the second-largest Shabbat dinner goal behind New York University, which holds a citywide Shabbat 2000. Greenfeder said Shab-bat 1800 at UF will be the largest Shabbat dinner to ever hit any college campus.
Ali Lakofsky, the event’s 
co-coordinator and a 21-year-old UF political science ju-nior, said although the event is targeted at Jewish stu-dents, anyone is welcome to attend.
Chabad at UF, Hillel and 
the Jewish Student Union will pay for the event and the dinner with the help of private donors.
“We were able to fund-
raise $7,000 alone from indi-vidual contributions in the community and from friends and family.” Lakofsky said.Jewish organizations

Anthony Rapp sat on the floor of the Reitz Union 
Grand Ballroom with his legs crossed in front of about 
25 UF students Thursday. Best known for originating the role of Mark Cohen in the Broadway musical “Rent,” Rapp spoke in an open forum for students interested in theater three hours before his scheduled public speech.
Rapp, who was paid $15,000 to come to UF, gave ad-
vice to actors trying to break into the business.
“Good luck trying not to be nervous,” he said. “What-
ever you have going on for you … Nerves are energy.”
Wesley Huffman, a 19-year-old exploratory fresh-man, was among the students in the private session.
“I thought it was really cool to hear from a seasoned 
Broadway veteran up close in person,” he said.
During the event hosted by Reitz Union Board En-
tertainment and Accent Speaker’s Bureau, Rapp spoke to nearly 300 students about the road to “Rent” and the death of the musical’s creator, Jonathan Larson, who only witnessed rehearsal versions of the show.
“I feel a tremendous honor and responsibility to bear 
witness to what we all went through together and hon-or Jonathan’s legacy,” Rapp said. He said working on “Rent” was an exciting musical endeavor, but he had no idea how big a sensation it would become.
“It’s utterly transformed my life,” Rapp said. “Thank 
you for being interested and celebrating the work he [Larson] and everyone did to bring this into the world.”

Bills that would require a 
unanimous vote to sentence 
someone to death haven’t budged in the state House of Representatives and Senate.
Current law stipulates that 
juries only need a majority vote to sentence a person to death. Florida is the only state with that minimum of a requirement, which has Florida Sen. Darren Soto (D-Kissimmee) concerned. Soto co-introduced SB 148 in December. It was referred to committees but never made it to a vote in any of them.
“Just keep in mind, the folks 
who are getting a death penalty are getting life in prison,” he said. “Whether they should be executed or not is another ques-tion.”
Soto said Florida has seen 
many people exonerated by DNA evidence, which suggests there needs to be more safe-guards in the system.
Katheryn Zambrana, a UF 
criminology professor, sees more safeguards as a positive thing, which the proposed leg-islation provides for in more than one way. 
Zambrana explained the 
jury must first unanimously agree the defendant is guilty. In order to sentence the defendant to death with the current law, a jury determines if the aggra-vating circumstances, such as if a murder was premeditated, outweigh the mitigating cir-cumstances, like if a defendant had a history of child abuse or mental illness.With the proposed legis-
lation, a jury would have to unanimously prove each aggra-vating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt and all agree to issue the death penalty.
“The process is longer, but 
I think it’s better,” Zambrana said. “It’ll reduce the likelihood of wrongful conviction and will ensure that jurors are sure in their conviction.”
However, the legislation is 
controversial. State Attorney Bill Cervone said he doesn’t see a need for a change in the cur-rent law.
“What it does is allow the 
possibility for one aberrational juror to hold the rest of the jury hostage to their own personal belief,” he said.
Cervone said a long list of 
safeguards already exist in Florida. A judge can override a jury’s decision, or a defendant can appeal the decision in high-er courts, he said.
In Tallahassee, HB 961 spon-
sor Rep. Mark Pafford (D-West Palm Beach) said he’s disap-pointed the bill hasn’t moved.
Pafford said committees

“You get one opportunity to 
make a decision as to whether or not you’re going to take a life,” he said. “My goal in this bill is to make that decision unanimous for a jury, to provide more po-tential that somebody isn’t put to death beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury.”

◗ THE FIRST OFFENSE IS A 
$30 FINE.

Texting while driving may be 
illegal in Florida as soon as May 
3 if a bill passed unanimously Tuesday in the Florida Senate also passes in the state’s House of Rep-resentatives.
Police could charge a driver 
with texting while driving only as a “secondary offense,” mean-ing the driver would have to be already doing something wrong such as swerving or changing speeds. The first offense would be met with a $30 fine, and if the of-fense is repeated within five years, the fine would be doubled and three points would be added to the offender’s license.
Texting while driving has re-
cently become a more frequent deadly habit for Americans, said Patrick Sheehy, a representative for UNITE, a health and wellness organization, who was running a distracted driving simulation booth on UF’s campus Thursday.
In 2009, there were about 450,000 
injuries due to distracted driving, which is 20 percent of all accidents on the road, Sheehy said.
For every letter typed, the driv-
er’s eyes are off the road for about three to four seconds, and those letters can add up, Sheehy said.
“If you’re driving blind, you’re 
not driving,” he said. “You’re just throwing a moving time bomb down the road.”
The bill has built-in exceptions 
for those using a GPS or reading safety-related information. Tex-ting at red lights would still be al-lowed.
Eric Strack, a 22-year-old UF 
advertising senior, tried a simula-tor Thursday, but he said he re-mained confident in his abilities to text while driving.
However, hearing about the 
impending legislation quickly changed his mind.  
“I know it’s hard to stop cold 
turkey because sometimes, you just have to send a message out,” he said, “but definitely, I’ll start limiting to just red lights and even-tually cut it out completely.”
Florida sends message about texting 
“If you’re driving blind, 
you’re not driving. You’re 
just throwing a moving time 
bomb down the road.”

I agree with scientists: Mars or bust
Last week, Stephen Hawking gave humanity a startling 
prediction.
“We won’t survive another 1,000 years without es-
caping our fragile planet,” the physicist said. 
Hawking emphasized the critical need for our species to 
continue space exploration and expansion into the universe.
Such sentiments have also been articulated to some degree 
by others. Scientists like Neil deGrasse Tyson, who recently spoke at UF, also emphasize the importance of continuing human expansion into the universe. 
To these scientists, the next destination is clear: Mars.Tyson has spoken on numerous occasions of the cultural 
impact an expedition to Mars would have. He imagines a future in which the younger generation will be excited by a Mars mission, inspiring them to create a better future for humanity. To Tyson, an expedition to Mars would be an in-vestment.
So, how far is the United States from a manned mission to 
the Red Planet? Unfortunately for Americans, the U.S. isn’t leading the charge. NASA doesn’t have any plans to bring humans to the surface of Mars, but it is planning to set people in orbit of the planet in the 2030s.
Russia, on the other hand, is assuming the role of the am-
bitious leader of a manned Mars mission. In 2011, a group of volunteers from China, Europe and South America partici-pated in the Mars-500 experiment, where they were conﬁ  ned to a mock spaceship for 520 days, simulating a round-trip to Mars.
Although this might not seem like much, such a gesture 
of international fellowship — something the United States has historically enjoyed offering — could signal the start of a new leader in the space race.
I would remind the reader that since the retirement of the 
space shuttle, NASA has no primary vehicle for sending peo-ple into space. To get to the International Space Station, our own astronauts take a lift on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft.
Russia isn’t the only threat to American dominance of the 
race to Mars. A group of Dutch entrepreneurs plans to send a group of humans to the Red Planet one-way. The project, called Mars One, would be funded in part through a reality TV show chronicling the ad-ventures of the travelers.
Mars One is searching for 
volunteers from the public for the trip and has already col-lected 45,000 emails from in-terested parties. I expect this number will skyrocket as time progresses and the plans of Mars One come into fruition.
Although I’m hopeful for 
this initiative, the fact is no private enterprise has done so much as put a satellite in orbit of Mars. Even Russia has had problems with getting probes to Mars. It would seem NASA is still our best hope for getting humans to the planet.
But why go to Mars at all? We have enough problems 
here, don’t we?
A manned trip to Mars would change everything. There is no greater force for good today than the explora-
tion of the cosmos. A renewed interest in expansion would change a lot for the better, but more than anything, it would change the way we view ourselves.
From Earth, Mars is just a pale, red dot. Imagine what 
Earth must look like from Mars. Imagine what a revolution in consciousness it would be to have one of our own, a repre-sentative of humanity, touch down on that world and behold our home, Earth, as nothing more than a pale, blue dot.
I’m not sure there is a more inspiring and humbling im-
age: Look at how small we are. From a cosmic perspective, Earth is a very small place. 
But look at how far we’ve come: Our small, fragile bodies 
have endured the harshness of space and time to ﬁ  nally sail the seas of space and touch the sands of another world. That image is something that will more profoundly and positively change humanity than any laws, speeches or stimuli ever could.

As a response to Brad Paisley and LL Cool J’s experi-
mentally tragic bridge-gapping song, “Accidental Rac-ist,” Stephen Colbert premiered a new song of his own. 
“That’s a pretty good deal, Paisley,” said Colbert on his broad-cast Wednesday night. “LL will forget 250 years of enslavement if you accept his taste in accessories.” He sang a few bars of it with actor Alan Cumming, who was the guest that episode, af-ter calling out the hilarity and terribleness of Paisley. We highly suggest you go watch footage of the song, but bear in mind, some of the language is a little offensive — but a lot hilarious. We give a the-only-way-to-ﬁ  ght-ﬁ  re-is-with-ﬁ  re-and-the-same-goes-for-stupid-stuff LAUREL to Stephen Colbert! Nobody 
does it like you, sir.
A long time ago — it was reported this week — in a galaxy 
far, far away — this one — scientists discovered three planets that could potentially sustain life. “Astronomers have spotted more than 800 planets orbiting nearby stars in recent decades, but only a handful have been Earth-sized, ‘Goldilocks’ worlds, not too hot and not too cold for water,” according to a USA To-day article. “Astronomers consider water an essential ingredient for the possibility of life on other planets.” The Kepler space tele-scope spotted two planets that orbit around one star, Kepler-62, and one planet that orbits Kepler-69.

Twitter’s trying to be more hip with the youth, apparently, 
as it launched a new app this week: #music. What is #music? “The platform tracks the Twitter activity of a range of acts, and highlights trending bands, singers, and rappers on its tiled homepage. In addition, you can search for ‘emerging’ artists or have Twitter recommend an act, based on the artists you already follow,” explained The Christian Science Monitor. You only get quick previews of songs, though, so it’s more of a music dis-covery device than it is an actual streaming service. We give a well-this-wasn’t-something-we-needed-like-at-all-but-at-least-the-interface-is-pretty DART to Twitter! Maybe y’all can work 
on making the actual app look a little better. Now that we’re going to waste time complaining about our smartphones.
This week, the popular website BuzzFeed was mentioned on 
both “The Colbert Report” and on the ﬂ  oor of the House of Rep-resentatives. Although most people reference the website in re-gards to its time-wasting aspects, it’s becoming more and more widely recognized as a source for breaking news. This week especially showed us that news sites should try to be accurate and patient before reporting something incorrectly. Combine that with the more playful aspects of the site, and it’s no won-der more people are tuning into the pop culture-y stuff as well as the news. We give a don’t-let-the-teasing-bring-you-down LAUREL to BuzzFeed.
That’s it for the last Darts & Laurels of the semester. Or should 
we say, Laurels & Laurels. Stay sane and safe heading into your ﬁ  nal exams, folks. Have a good weekend, and go Gators!

Gators in the NBA
Eight former Florida players will participate for seven 
teams in the 2013 NBA Playoffs. The postseason begins on Saturday.Poll Question

 After Florida’s 5-3 win at Florida Gulf 
Coast on Tuesday, the Gators are winners of six in a row as they travel to Columbia, 
Mo., this weekend to take on Missouri — the 13th-ranked team in the Southeastern Conference. Josh Jurnovoy and Adam Pincus debate whether Flori-da’s recent run of success is sustainable or merely a hot streak.s  Josh: Florida (20-18, 8-7 SEC) has every right to be happy about the past two weeks. After a 2-0 loss to Mississippi State on April 6, the Gators were four games under .500 with their next ﬁ  ve games coming against ranked op-ponents and a game after that stretch against an FGCU team that swept them in Gainesville earlier in the season. Even though Florida won all of those games, that doesn’t mean it is primed for a deep postseason run. The Gators have gotten a lot of help from the opposition during the streak — they’ve scored nine un-earned runs. They can’t count on getting that much assistance from better teams later in the season. To counteract that, Florida will have to show more consistency both pitching and hitting than it has to this point.
  Adam: What better teams are you talking 
about? Only one of Florida’s ﬁ  ve remaining SEC series — at No. 3 LSU on May 2-4 — comes against a ranked team. Excluding the Tigers and their 35-3 record, the other four teams have a winning percentage of .465 and are 17-43 in SEC play. That’s weaker than you in the gym, and that’s giving those teams — Missouri, Tennessee, Auburn and Georgia — more credit than they deserve. It hasn’t been pretty for Florida this season. Most of UF’s early-season mistakes were head-scratchers. Flying out in the inﬁ  eld on a 2-0 count with runners in scoring position. Hitting a batter to lead off an inning after grabbing a lead. It all happened, but it takes time for a young team to turn it around. While the Gators almost dug themselves in a hole they couldn’t get out of, it appears they’ve ﬁ  nally turned it around.
  
Josh: There’s no question the rest of the reg-ular season sets up well for Florida, and it’ll probably look dominant and raise expecta-tions to unreasonable heights for the postsea-son. But the fact remains the Gators probably won’t win a regional if their pitching doesn’t improve and they get consistent quality starts — which entails throwing at least six innings while giving up no more than three runs. During their winning streak, the Gators have one such a start. For the season, they’ve had three — all courtesy of Jona-thon Crawford — and a combined four other outings from Danny Young, Bobby Poyner and Jay Carmichael that were more than ﬁ  ve innings with just one run allowed. With games bunched closer together in the SEC and NCAA Tournaments, the bullpen won’t sur-vive if the starters don’t start giving it more of a rest.
Adam: In a regional format, I’ll take Florida’s pitching any day. Granted it’s not the work-horse staff the Gators leaned on last season, but a combination of Crawford, Carmichael and maybe even Johnny Magliozzi could get the job done. Relievers Daniel Gibson and Ryan Harris have pitched the Gators into a regional from the bullpen. This Gators team isn’t the same squad playing its way out of the postseason. This is a dangerous team with burgeoning talent at the plate and on the mound.

  Kelsey Horton has been a versatile player since she arrived 
at Florida in 2010. She is now playing the role of one of the 
Gators’ hottest hitters.
  Since Florida started its series against Mississippi State on 
April 5, Horton is 8 for 19 at the plate with three home runs and 10 RBI, three of which came in the Gators’ 8-0 win against the Seminoles on Wednesday in Tallahassee.
  Horton will look to carry that momentum into No. 3 Flor-
ida’s  (42-5, 14-4 Southeastern Conference) three-game series against Longwood (33-11, 13-5 Big South Conference) this weekend. The series is the Gators’ only three-game set against a non-conference opponent this season.
  “This (was) our last midweek game ever,” Horton said. 
“We’re closing out the end of the season and trying to ﬁ  nish 
strong.”
  Horton is on her way to closing out 
the season strong. She is hitting .317 in conference play and has a batting aver-
age of .421 in her past eight games.
  Horton has moved around the ﬁ  eld during the past two 
seasons. Although primarily an outﬁ  elder, Horton spent much of last season behind the plate. After junior catcher Brit-tany Schutte suffered a jaw injury and retired, Horton took over catching duties from the career .342 hitter.
  Although she had experience at catcher, Horton spent 
most of her playing time prior to 2012 in the outﬁ  eld or as the designated player.
  “Everyone’s kind of gone through the same thing, just do-
ing whatever you can to help your team,” Horton said.
  As the Gators’ No. 1 catcher in 2012, Horton had the best 
season of her career, batting .329 with a career-high 13 home runs in 59 games.
  This season, Horton’s numbers have tapered off. Her aver-
age is down 33 points at .296 and her slugging percentage is  Senior outﬁ  elder looking to continue hot streak at plate

Senior Billy Federhofer prepares to backhand the ball during Florida’s 
7-0 win against St. John’s on Jan. 26 at Linder Stadium.
Men’S TenniS
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Writer
Florida could see the return of 
senior Billy Federhofer when it 
begins postseason play. 
Federhofer (right ankle) will 
be a game-time decision for No. 3 seed UF in its matchup against sixth-seeded South Carolina to-day at 10 a.m. in the Southeastern Conference Tournament at the Palmer/Salloum Tennis Center in Oxford, Miss. 
The senior has missed Florida’s 
past five matches after injuring his ankle during practice.
“Billy’s been a big, vital part of 
our success this year,” first-year coach Bryan Shelton said. “We’d like to get him back out there on the court. … Some things are just out of your control.”
Federhofer is 10-3 in singles 
play this season — the best win-ning percentage on the team.
The Miami native competed in the No. 5 and the No. 6  positions in singles for the majority of the season.
He climbed to the No. 3 spot 
for two matches before suffering his injury. 
In Federhofer’s absence, the 
Gators have picked up the slack.
No. 14 Florida (14-9, 7-5 South-
eastern Conference) is coming off its most successful weekend of the season, beating No. 8 Kentucky (4-3) and No. 13 Vanderbilt (4-1). Since beginning the season 9-8, the Gators have won four of their past five matches — three against teams ranked in the top 15. 
The Gators have maintained 
success in doubles play without the duo of Federhofer and red-shirt freshman Gordon Watson. During the past three matches, UF has won seven of its nine doubles matches.
Florida is 12-1 this year when it 
clinches the doubles point. 
“We feel like we have enough depth on this team, we have enough talent out there, we do enough things the right way where it’s going to be difficult for teams to win four or five matches against us in singles,” Shelton said.
“So getting the doubles point 
certainly gives us some confi-dence.”
The Gators last won an SEC 
title in 2011. As a No. 10 seed, Florida fell to Ole Miss 4-1 in the quarterfinals of the SEC Tourna-ment last season.
Florida fell 4-3 at South Caro-
lina (17-9, 7-5 SEC) on March 8. The winner of today’s match will advance to the semifinals on Sat-urday at 11 a.m.
“We’re certainly happy about 
the last couple of weekends and how we’ve done,” Shelton said. “But we know we’re just one slip-up away from being knocked out the tournament in the first round, so we’ve got to be ready.”

CHUCK KINGSBURY
Alligator Writer
Inside the HP Pavilion center in 
San Jose, Calif., Bridget Sloan was 
vying for a spot on the U.S. Gym-nastics team at the Olympic trials on June 28, 2012. 
Four years had passed since the 
2008 Beijing Olympics.  
Sloan was considered a veteran 
after competing on the silver medal-winning team in Beijing. She now faced younger U.S. gymnasts such as Jordyn Wieber and Gabby Doug-las. 
A 20-year-old Bridget was the 
fourth-oldest of 15 gymnasts com-peting at the 2012 Olympic trials preliminaries that day.
“I remember waking up that 
morning feeling good,” Sloan said. “I was like ‘All right, today’s the day. It’s trials.’”
Sloan traveled to San Jose with 
her coach, Marvin Sharp, while her mother and father, Mary and Jeff Sloan, planned to arrive the evening before the first night of trials. 
Sharp, who has coached Bridget 
since she was four, knew her medi-cal history before going to Califor-nia. Bridget had suffered numerous injuries to her knees, ankles and arms since joining the U.S. national team in 2003.   
“By the time we got to the sum-
mer of 2012, she’d been training and competing for 10 years at that level,” Sharp said. 
Sharp knew Bridget, the most 
decorated gymnast at trials, faced enormous pressure. She was the 2009 World Championships all-around champion, a six-time Visa Championship competitor and a Pan American Games gold medal-ist. “She accomplished a lot — I 
mean a lot more than 99 percent of the gymnasts out there,” Sharp said. 
On the night before trials, while 
practicing her routine on uneven bars, Bridget released too soon on one of her favorite skills, the ‘Church’ and realized she was off her mark when her toes came off the bar.
“I felt a little off when I was up 
there on the equipment,” she said.
Bridget fell flat onto the practice 
mats. Her elbow ricocheted off of the sting mat just below her. With-out any hesitation, she propped up, powdered her hands with chalk and prepared for another rotation. 
She skipped her release and per-
formed her jump exclusively to try to avoid the pain that pierced through her arm. But she couldn’t shake it.   
Meanwhile, Bridget’s parents were en route to the HP Pavilion Center. A family friend reached out to Mary via text, worried by Bridg-et’s injury. Unaware of the situation, her mother, Mary, couldn’t make sense of it all. 
But any cause for concern was 
quickly dismissed. Mary’s friend followed up with a text that Bridget had moved on to balance beam. 
After consulting with USA Gym-
nastics medical coordinator Dr. Lar-ry Nassar, Bridget returned to the balance beam and attempted a back handspring. Her arm, weak from her fall, collapsed. Clutching her el-bow, Bridget turned to Sharp with a look of concern. 
“I looked at Marvin and told him 
something wasn’t right,” Bridget said.
Sloan convened with Dr. Nas-sar, who diagnosed Bridget with a bruised nerve in her elbow.
When Jeff and Mary finally made 
it to the arena, Bridget called, urg-ing them to meet her in the medical room just below the stadium.
Bridget and Sharp felt it was in 
her best interest to forgo the remain-der of the trials to avoid further in-jury to her elbow. 
“That wasn’t how we wanted to 
end our season, but we weren’t go-ing to go out there and cause her anymore damage, and we didn’t want to go out and have 16 falls and have that be her last memory,” Sharp said. 
Bridget’s announcement came 
one month before the London Olym-pics began, ending a career that took her from Pittsboro, Ind., to Beijing.  
“(When I was) going through the 
MRI and X-Ray, and I realized that I was done... I started really appreci-ating gymnastics and what it offered me and what I’ve been able to give back,” Bridget said. 
             
In the weeks following her in-
jury, Bridget took time to allow her elbow to heal. She worked closely with trainer Darrell Barnes in India-napolis. 
Following rehab, she traveled to 
several gymnastics camps including Camp Woodward in Woodward, Pa., — a camp she has coached at since 2009 — and Flip Fest located in Crossville, Tenn. 
“She kept herself very busy,” 
Mary said. “She kept herself focused on other things.”
At the camps she served as a 
floater for the training staffs, walk-ing from apparatus to apparatus, correcting back handsprings and bar swings. 
She began to sound like her coach 
of 16 years. 
“People kept telling me I taught 
the way Marvin [Sharp] did,” Bridg-et said. 
By the end of July, Bridget re-focused her attention to selecting a college. She deferred endorsement money throughout her Elite career for a chance to compete collegiately. 
Her list had three schools: Utah, 
Georgia and Florida. With her de-cision she would become the first World Championships all-around titlist ever to compete collegiately. 
Utes coach Greg Marsden shared 
the same opinion of Bridget as other coaches: she was the most talented freshman going into college gym-nastics. 
“Everyone knew she was a blue-
chipper,” said Marsden. “She brings a great deal to a program with not only her abilities, but her personality, and everybody knew that and that’s why we recruited her so hard.”
When Bridget called Rhonda 
Faehn to tell her she would become a Gator, there was no answer. On her second try, she got a hold of her new coach, who described Sloan’s commitment as a “present.” 
After falling 0.075 points short of 
winning the national championship at last year’s Super Six, the Gators nabbed Bridget, who made Florida a national title favorite in 2013. 
             
Sloan did not know what to ex-
pect at Florida. Her soon-to-be prac-tices differed from the ones she was familiar with at the Elite level.  
Her teammates were skeptical, 
too. 
Junior Lauren Rose was unsure 
of Sloan’s personality. Performing alongside her was a former Olym-pian with enough competition hard-ware to fill Florida’s trophy room. 
“I didn’t know if she would ac-
knowledge me,” Rose said jokingly. “And then again, I didn’t know that we would become such good friends because she’s so good.”
Admittedly, Sloan felt nervous 
throughout the team’s preseason regiments until Florida’s opening meet against Ball State on Jan. 4. Sloan competed on three events and took an outright win on vault — her signature event. 
Since the postseason began, Sloan 
has performed her best yet.
Sloan holds the NCAA’s best 
regional qualifying score of 9.955 on uneven bars, and has won the event outright six times this season. On balance beam, she has a regional qualifying score of 9.92, second only to Oklahoma’s Taylor Spears’ score of 9.945.
Bridget continued to impress at 
the Southeastern Conference Cham-pionships on March 23 in Little Rock, Ark. She earned a share of the SEC all-around title with a score of 39.75 — following in the footsteps of teammate Kytra Hunter, who earned the title as a freshman in 2012. 
Her journey to Gainesville may 
have been littered with injuries, but Sloan is as confident in her abilities as ever. 
Now, Bridget has a chance to get 
the Gators back to the Super Six to-day at 3 p.m. at the NCAA Champi-onships Semifinal in Los Angeles.
“I’m so glad that I kept my 
NCAA eligibility and came to Flor-ida,” Sloan said. “And to be part of such a great team is such an honor.”

Ebony Eutsey’s high school track and 
field resume was sparkling.
“Every year was a process,” Eutsey said. 
“In 10th grade, I won state in both the 200 
and the 400. In 11th grade, I won Nike Out-door Nationals and made the world team to go compete in Italy.”
But she got off track near the finish line, 
suffering an injury away from the field.
“My senior year wasn’t the best, 
though,” Eutsey said. “I got hurt in P.E. try-ing to run a 40 against a couple of guys.”
After suffering the injury, Eutsey strug-
gled to recover.
“From there, it was a downfall.” Eutsey 
said. “I had gained weight. It was really hard for me.”
Despite her injury, UF coach Mike Hol-
loway offered Eutsey a track scholarship. 
But the decision was not an easy one. 
Eutsey spent many tear-filled nights con-templating which school to attend.
“It was intense,” Eutsey said. “I didn’t 
know where I was going. I ended up bat-tling between Florida and Texas. It was just so stressful. I would cry to my mom. She’d say, ‘Ebony, I’m not telling you where to go. It’s your decision.’” 
Despite growing up in Miami, Eutsey 
never dreamed of competing at UF.
“I never had the ritual or history to 
become a Gator,” she said. “I never knew what college I wanted to go to. I finally said to myself that I was just going to Florida. I didn’t need to leave the state to be suc-cessful.”
Since arriving in Gainesville, Eutsey has 
shown significant progress. In her freshman and sophomore sea-
sons, she was impatient and failed to stay at the weight she wanted to maintain.
“My freshman year, I was hard on my-
self,” Eutsey said. “I wasn’t patient at all. Coach Holloway would always talk to me about patience. I also put on a lot of weight. Part of it was muscle, part of it was fat. I just was too heavy. Sophomore year, I worked on losing weight. I lost some but I still wasn’t where I wanted to be.”
Eutsey has cut weight since her fresh-
man year and worked on her speed by competing in the 200m sprints. She plans to compete in the 200 at the Tom Jones Memo-rial Classic this weekend in Gainesville.
“I’m running a 200,” she said. “I opened 
up with 23.5 and I’m ex-pecting to run a 23.3 or a 23.4. Something faster. It doesn’t have to be off the charts. Just something to show that I’ve been im-proving.”
Holloway added: 
“She didn’t like to sprint when she got here. It’s 
hard to be a great quarter-miler if you don’t want to sprint and get faster. She’s totally bought into the program now. She understands what the thought process is to become a great quarter-miler. She’s on the right path right now. We’re pleased with her development.”
Eutsey’s “buying-in” has launched her 
to new heights this season, breaking a UF record in the women’s 4x400m relay — her favorite event.
“Of course, nothing can ever take the 
place of the 400,” Eutsey said. “That’s my baby. That will always be my favorite event.”Senior sprinter finishing strong

Bache pitched shutout vs. FSU
down from .645 to .600. However, she is still 
one of the Gators’ key offensive producers. Her average is fourth-best on the team, and she ranks second in doubles and home runs coming into the last series of her college ca-reer.
“Having a player like Kelsey Horton on 
the roster is huge,” coach Tim Walton said. 
Bache picking up slack: When sophomore 
Alyssa Bache started against Ole Miss in Oxford, Miss., on March 31, rain cut her afternoon short. With a wet pitching circle and a soaked softball, Bache surrendered six runs in the fifth inning.
Since that disastrous frame, Bache has 
tossed 13 innings and surrendered only one run for an ERA of 0.54.
Bache continued her hot streak against 
Florida State on Wednesday, pitching five shutout innings and only allowing two hits.

Senior Sam Farrell runs down the field during Florida’s 16-9 win against Stony Brook on 
Feb. 20 at Dizney Stadium. UF will clinch the American Lacrosse Conference championship outright win a win against Northwestern on Saturday and a Penn State loss.
MAX MATTERN
Alligator Writer
Florida has come up short on defense 
during American Lacrosse Conference 
play, a trend that could prove troubling in the final weekend of the season.
If the Gators finish in a three-way 
conference tie, the title winner is de-termined by which team has allowed the fewest goals during the conference season.  
Florida (15-1, 3-1 ALC) enters the 
weekend tied for second with Penn State. Each sits a game behind confer-ence-leader Northwestern (13-1, 4-0 ALC). 
Northwestern currently owns the 
tiebreaker, having allowed only 27 goals during conference play compared with Florida’s 42 goals allowed and Penn State’s 48. 
The Gators face the Wildcats at noon 
on Saturday in Dizney Stadium. Penn State faces Johns Hopkins on Saturday. If the Nittany Lions lose and Gators win, Florida earns the ALC title outright.
“It’ll all work out in the end,” coach 
Amanda O’Leary said. “There’s all these different outcomes and all these differ-ent scenarios, but until every team has played its final game, we won’t know what the standings will be.”
Against their first 12 non-conference 
opponents, the Gators defense was seemingly  impenetrable. Florida al-lowed an average of 5.67 goals per game while facing perennial national cham-pionship contenders Syracuse, North Carolina, Loyola and Dartmouth.
But that de-
fensive success has not translat-ed to conference 
play. Florida has allowed 10.5 goals per game in four conference matchups.
“I think we need to play a better de-
fensive game,” O’Leary said. “We are a little unsettled at times, and I think we have to go back to playing a solid de-fense.”
After allowing double-digit goals 
only once through 12 games, Florida has given up at least 10 goals against No. 6 Penn State and unranked Vander-bilt.

The Gators are about to face one 
of their toughest tests this year.
After earning three top-three 
team finishes in the regular season, 
Florida, ranked No. 11 by golf-week.com, opens the Southeastern Conference Championship in St. Simons Island, Ga., on Friday. 
“This sounds kind of strange to say, but we’re healthy,” coach Buddy Alexander said. “We got our boy, T.J. (Vogel), back from the Masters. We didn’t play with T.J. two weeks ago at the (Gary Koch Invitational) so no excuses, ready to go. Time to put it together, and I honestly believe we’re going to play well down the stretch.”  
The SEC Championship is com-
ing at an opportune time for the Gators, who are healthy for the first time this 
season.  
Vogel strug-
gled to play his best after un-dergoing sports hernia surgery in winter. Senior captain Tyler 
McCumber had the flu earlier in the year, freshman A.J. Crouch had mono, and sophomore Eric Banks underwent open-heart surgery during the summer.  
But the group has rounded into 
form entering the playoffs.
Vogel’s play will be critical to 
Florida’s title hopes. The Gators last won the conference champion-ship in 2010-11. 
“Well, you know, we expanded 
the SEC this year so Missouri and Texas A&M will be there, but other than that everybody else has that same familiarity (with the course),” Alexander said.  
“If you’ve got a veteran team 
and they’ve played there for a long time, obviously, then that can help you a little bit.”
Florida is the No. 2 seed in the 
tournament.
Alexander hopes the Gators 
will receive an early tee time and avoid the wind that comes at Sea-side Golf Club.
