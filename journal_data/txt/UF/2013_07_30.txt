The winners of the 2013 student football ticket lottery were 
announced Thursday, and unlike last year, tickets are complete-
ly sold out. 
University Athletic Association assistant athletics director 
Mark Gajda said the department met its quota of selling 21,500 
UF student and band tickets. Last year, the student ticket of-
fice had to extend the lottery by two weeks because it had more than 1,000 tickets left over, he said.
Gajda said student season tickets cost $90 for the six home 
games this year — $15 less than last year. During 2012-2013, the Gators played seven home games.
The Gators’ record could be the reason. In 2011, the football 
team went 7-6. Football attendance dropped by 1.6 percent from 2011 to 2012, according to Alligator archives. But in 2012, the Football lottery
results are in: It’s a sell-out

Pedro Bravo’s murder trial likely won’t 
happen until next year.
Bravo, who is accused of kidnapping 
and killing UF student Christian Aguilar, 
appeared at a pretrial conference Friday at the Alachua County 
Courthouse as lawyers argued about a schedule for evidence discovery 
and the depositions of 
103 witnesses.
Judge Denise Ferrero, 
who recently took over the case from Peter Sieg, set a deposition cutoff date of Jan. 14.
State Attorney Brian Kramer said wit-
nesses live across the state — in Tampa, 
Orlando and Miami, where the Aguilar 
family drove from to attend Friday’s con-ference — so travel must be considered. 
“We have a genuine desire to have this case brought to trial in a reasonable time 
period,” Kramer said.
Bravo’s defense lawyer, Michael Rup-
pert, said he’s set some deposition dates 
for mid-September.
“I understand the family wants this to 
come to closure,” Ruppert said.
Kramer also mentioned he was waiting 
to receive test results on two pieces of evi-
dence: the duct tape used to bind Aguilar 
and a computer seized from Bravo’s apart-ment.Lawyers in Pedro Bravo case argue about schedule, 103 witnesses

Ted Spiker arrived on campus, parked 
at the O’Connell Center and walked to his 
office in Weimer Hall on Thursday morn-
ing. 
But as he passed the James W. “Bill” 
Heavener Football Complex, he noticed a man with a saw cutting into brick.
“Every once in a while, I’ve passed [Aaron Hernandez’s brick] and thought, 
‘Gosh, what’s going to happen with this?’” 
said the UF journalism professor.
By removing the former Gator’s com-
memorative All-America brick from out-side the James W. “Bill” Heavener Football Complex. UF distanced itself from Hernan-dez, who is being held without bail after pleading not guilty to first-degree murder and five firearms-related charges. 
He is also being investigated in connec-
tion with a double murder that took place in July 2012. He is also involved in a law-suit in which he was accused of shooting a man in the right eye.The University Ath-
letic Association released a statement shortly af-ter images of the brick removal went viral an-nouncing removal of Her-
nandez mementos from campus areas, including the South Endzone team area, Heavener Complex, 
Kornblau Lobby and the brick display en-trance to the football facility.
“We didn’t feel it was appropriate to 
celebrate Aaron Hernandez,” the state-ment said. “We put together an immediate plan after the initial news broke to remove 
his likeness and name in various private 
and public areas in the facility … We were able to implement some of the changes im-mediately, and this [brick removal] was a more complex process to complete with our vendors. The plan was to have every-thing completed before the end of July.”
As a junior in 2009, Hernandez was rec-
ognized as both a first-team All-American 
and All-Southeastern Conference selec-
tion.

Diedrich, 82, now has his 
class of 1949 ring from J. Ster-ling Morton High School in Cicero thanks to a Waukesha, Wis., man who returned it to him after finding it with a metal detector in a lake near his home.
The ring’s journey back to 
its proper owner in Illinois 
began with Mike Geiger’s 
phone call earlier this month to the Mattoon home of Dick Diedrich and his wife of 60 years, Doris.
“He said, ‘I think I have 
something that goes back to your high school years,” Dick Diedrich said. “At that point 
the story with the ring popped 
into my head.”
It seems that back in high 
school, Diedrich exchanged rings with his then-sweetheart, Doris. He said she only took his ring off “when they were dissecting frogs” in biology class.
In mid-1948, Doris put it on 
a shelf to wash her hands af-ter biology class and when she turned around the ring was gone, as was another girl in the washroom.
“She was quite confident it 
got stolen,” Diedrich told The Associated Press.
That’s how things stood un-
til Geiger called. He explained to Diedrich that he was using a metal detector at a lake near his home when he discovered the ring and pulled it from the water. “It really was in excel-lent shape for being so old,” said Diedrich.
Gieger did a little detective 
work, Diedrich explained. He contacted the school’s alumni association and was told that out of the 1949 class of about 1,500 students, there were two graduates with the initials R.D., including Richard “Dick” WHAT’S HAPPENING?

Missing high school ring discov -
ered after 65 years 
MATTOON, Ill. — If find-
ing a high school ring doesn’t seem like a big deal, consider this: Until a few days ago, the last time Dick Diedrich saw his Deidrich.
Geiger called the other R.D., 
but he wasn’t very friendly, so he called Diedrich, the news-paper reported. Believing he had the right R.D., he mailed Diedrich the ring. Diedrich said he wanted to send Geiger a re-
ward, “but he said he was just 
pleased to be able to return it.” He sent him one anyway, along with a nice letter.
Deidrich has continued to do 
research to make sure that the ring is, in fact, his. But he said Geiger is convinced the ring is in the hands of the rightful owner.
“’It’s your ring’ he told me. 
‘Keep it and enjoy it,’” Diedrich said. “So the bottom line is, I’m now sitting here at 82 years old with my class ring 63 years lat-er.”
Two-headed turtle at Texas zoo 
gets Facebook page 
SAN ANTONIO — A two-
headed turtle born last month at 
the San Antonio Zoo has become so popular that she has her own Facebook page.
Zoo officials say the Texas 
cooter, named Thelma and Lou-ise for the female duo in the 1991 Oscar-winning movie, has been doing well.
Spokeswoman Debbie Rios-
Vanskike says the turtle eats and swims, and added that the two heads — named Louise Left 
and Thelma Right — get along.
The Facebook page on Sun-
day showed photos of the quirky 
reptile and imaginary conversa-tions between the two heads.
The turtle hatched June 18. 
The animal is on display at the zoo’s Friedrich Aquarium.

A Gainesville man was ar-
rested Sunday after police said he 
urinated on an ofﬁ  cer and equip-
ment at the jail. 
Raymond Edward Lawhorn 
was driving east on Northeast Eighth Avenue when he ran into a curb, according to a Gainesville 
Police Department report. 
Lawhorn then tried to turn left but was blocked by a median, so 
he kept driving and almost hit a 
marked police car. 
Gainesville Police Ofﬁ  cer Fred 
Melaragno pulled him over, and Lawhorn immediately said he didn’t have a valid driver’s li-
cense.
When Melaragno took him to the Alachua County Jail, Lawhorn 
“pulled his penis out of his pants and began urinating on the ﬂ  oor, 
an X-ray machine and a detention 
ofﬁ  cer,” according to the report.
The unfortunate ofﬁ  cer was 
Jeremy Ranslow, who works for Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce.
Lawhorn was arrested on 
charges of battering a detention facility staff, resisting an ofﬁ  cer without violence and driving with 
a permanently-revoked license. 
As of press time, Lawhorn was in the process of being released after 
he posted bail of $10,000.
GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben 
Tobias said the incident was un-usual.
“I have been on the depart-
ment for almost nine years, and that’s the ﬁ  rst for me,” he said.TUESDAY, JULY 30, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Nine inventors presented their 
ﬁ  nal products as HackerHouse 
students at 101 Downtown on Sunday.
For the past three months, the 
students, called cadets, have been guided by mentors working to-ward a common goal: innovation. They pitched the ﬁ  nal products to investors at the weekend event.
The students and their house 
manager, Trevor Abbott, spent the summer living and inventing in a large, Victorian-era house near 
downtown Gainesville.
Some students formed teams 
while others worked individu-
ally to create ﬁ  ve companies: Spin Chill, Chime, MyReps, iFishEarth and GOOD Inc. The products they created ranged from smartphone apps to hardware items.
“Creating a company in three 
months and getting it off the ground and running is extremely stressful,” said Abbott, a 21-year-old UF mechanical engineering 
senior.
Abbott teamed up with Ty 
Parker, a 24-year-old UF mechani-
cal engineering alumnus, to create The Chill Bit, a device that quickly spins a canned beverage to cool it in 30 to 60 seconds.
Parker said HackerHouse was 
supposed to be a reality show, but 
the videographer moved to New 
York shortly after the summer started.
Brad Petti-
grew, a 28-year-old Ringling Col-lege of Art and Design graphic design alumnus, 
compared living 
in the house to a 
summer camp.
“It was a 
bunk bed, barracks-style sort of sit-uation,” he said. “I think that might be why they called us ‘cadets.’”
He said even the close quarters 
led to innovation.
“That led to some really good 
synergistic brainstorming sessions where it was really easy to bounce ideas off of each other and reﬁ  ne 
our products,” he said. “We could 
always get feedback immediate-ly.”
Pettigrew partnered with ca-
det Sam Gregory to develop iFis-hEarth, a mobile app for accessing ﬁ  shing reports and tide informa-tion.
Augi Lye, the 34-year-old 
founder of HackerHouse, said the ﬁ  rst semester of the program “ex-ceeded expectations.”
The winning prototype will re-
ceive a direct investment from Lye, and he will help develop the com-pany and recruit investors for it.
Lye said he has already chosen 
a winner. However, he said he’s 
not sure if he’ll publicly announce 
it.
“One thing I want to make ev-
eryone feel is that everyone’s a winner, whether I invest in you directly myself or not,” he said. “Everyone is walking away with something awesome.”
He said about 80 people have 
already applied for the Fall Hack-erHouse semester.HackerHouse students reveal projects

Gators came back, winning 11 games and losing two.
“We were worried that student tickets wouldn’t sell 
out again,” Gajda said, “but we are ecstatic to see the 
excitement displayed by the student body this year.”
UF English senior Josh Olin, 21, was happy Thurs-
day when he won tickets for the fourth year in a row.
“We go to a SEC school,” he said. “How can you not 
buy tickets for one of UF’s most cherished traditions?”
Olin said even though he wishes football tickets were 
free for students, like they are at many other schools, paying the $90 will be worth it to attend all games in his last year at UF.
“Buying the lottery was honestly just easier than hav-
ing to scout out tickets before the games,” Olin said.
Still, other UF students didn’t even apply for the lot-
tery.
Simon Moskovitz, a 19-year-old UF anthropology 
sophomore, said he thought it was a waste of money.
“I didn’t purchase the lottery last year either, and I 
still got a ticket to every game for free or just buying one on the street for $10 to $20,” Moskovitz said. “You can always find a friend who can’t attend the game last minute.”
UF law student Matt Michel, 28, didn’t enter the lot-
tery for the first time since 2005.
Michel said having one fewer game this year but 
paying almost the same price just wasn’t worth it. 
Plus, he said, last season was “awful” because every 
game took place in the afternoon.
“Even in fall it is too hot in Florida to be out in the sun 
for three hours, and students usually leave at halftime,” Michel said. “And plus, afternoon games in the Swamp 
are not ginger-friendly. No amount of sunscreen will 
last me that long.”Weather, record

During her night at the State 
Capitol, UF history senior Lauren 
Byers saw activism come alive.
Despite having red eyes burning 
with exhaustion and muscles sore 
from lying on tile, protesters woke 
up, invigorated, at 6 a.m. to the sound of music like it was still the first day of the sit-in, she said.
At least 20 Gainesville residents 
of activist group Dream Defenders’ UF chapter have been participating in a sit-in at the State Capitol since July 16. They aim to enact legisla-tion they say would, among other things, repeal Florida’s Stand Your Ground law and ban racial profil-ing.
The group, formed after the 
murder of Trayvon Martin, wants to “[replace] jails with schools, [end] the illegal war on the undocument-ed, and [dismantle] the systems that 
criminalize our people,” according 
to its Facebook page. After George Zimmerman was found not guilty, Dream Defenders organized a sit-in inside the capitol building, calling on Gov. Rick Scott to arrange a spe-cial session of the state legislature.
Byers, the UF chapter vice presi-dent, said it took 
a “tragedy” to move people to join the move-ment.
“Before the 
verdict came out, there were about five people,” By-
ers, 21, said. “Our 
first planning meeting after the ver-
dict had 70 people. We got a type of response that I haven’t seen in three years of living in Gainesville.”
State Sen. Alan Hays, R-Umatil-
la, who received his dental degree from UF in 1976, said he didn’t hold many ties to Gainesville and there-fore couldn’t comment beyond no-ticing of the group’s presence. 
“I really don’t know of any com-
ment that I would make that would be flattering in any way at all,” he said. 
Hays’ current district, State Sen-
ate district 11, reaches from Ocala to 
near Sanford and throughout most 
of Lake County in central Florida.
The Florida Department of Law 
Enforcement reported Monday that it has spent nearly $200,000 in extra security since the protest began.
FDLE spokeswoman Gretl 
Plessinger said Capitol Police are enforcing rules regarding air mat-
tresses, maintaining peace and af-
ter-hours access to the lobby where the group is protesting.
In an email to Florida press, she 
wrote that protesters may remain after hours and “can leave at any-time, however Capitol Police will not open the doors for anyone until the Capitol opens for business.”
Byers said this ended the supply 
of food, “starving out” more than 
100 protesters. However, State Rep. 
Alan Williams, D-Tallahassee, and his staff have given food to the pro-testers, according to police state-ments.
“This shows the kind of escala-
tion of where the struggle is at right now,” Byers said. “The one night I was there really just confirmed that 
there are people that are committed 
to this fight. They’re not leaving.”

The strike that eight Tasty Buddha restau-
rant employees began last week formally end-
ed Saturday when franchise owner Parker Van Hart agreed to honor most of their demands.
“I am pleased and relieved to announce a 
mutually beneficial and satisfactory agreement has been reached and all parties involved are anxious to get back to work starting tomor-row,” Van Hart wrote on the Tasty Buddha Facebook page Sunday evening.
The two parties reached a compromise Sat-urday over the employees’ demand for consis-tent paychecks, Van Hart said. The strike start-ed after three employees’ paychecks bounced July 19.
Van Hart said he agreed to pay employees 
an inconvenience fee should another paycheck go bad. 
Mo Sherman, a 24-year-old cook at Tasty 
Buddha, said the inconvenience fee amount is $35, which an employee will receive if a check doesn’t clear. 
Van Hart said the flat fee is enough to “take 
them out to dinner and buy them a couple of beers.”
Van Hart also said the staff met to clear up 
discrepancies in the company’s harassment 
policy.
“By the end of the meeting Sunday, we 
were all on the same page,” he said. 
The strike has worsened Tasty Buddha’s fi-nancial state, Van Hart said. Two potential in-vestors backed out after the incident, he said.
Returning employees have agreed to do 
what they can to bring customers back to the 
restaurant, Sherman said. 
“We encourage everyone in the commu-
nity who used to eat there or who has never eaten there to come and support Tasty Bud-dha,” Sherman said. “Workers are happy, and happy workers make happy food.”
Seven of the eight employees who went on 
strike will return to Tasty Buddha. One em-ployee quit to focus on her studies, Van Hart said. Tasty Buddha strike resolved, all but one employee returns to work

Alachua County residents have increased 
their physical activity but are still getting 
larger, according to new study data.
The study, released this month by the 
Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, found that Florida experienced one of the most “big gains in physical activity.” 
According to the study, Alachua County 
residents’ physical activity increased be-tween 2001 and 2011, along with the national statistic, while obesity rose, also in line with the national average.The increase in physical activity could 
be a reﬂ  ection of local and national health campaigns, said Crystal Lim, Ph.D., a UF re-search assistant professor in the Department of Clinical and Health Psychology.
“I think it could mean that certain coun-
ties in Florida are doing a better job of en-couraging their residents to engage in more physical activity,” she said.
In Alachua County, the percentage of 
men getting “sufﬁ  cient physical activity” rose from 62.6 percent in 2001 to 63.3 percent in 2011, according to the study. For women, the amount increased from 52.4 percent to 53.8 percent in the same period. For obesity, the rate for men rose from 
21.8  percent in 2001 to 28.6 percent in 2011. The rate among women increased from 23 percent to 33.7 percent, according to the study. 
However, the study showed Alachua 
County men and women were slimmer than 
the national average, which was at 33.8 per-
cent  and 36.1 percent, respectively, in 2011.Lim said age may factor into the obesity 
rate, and Florida generally has more retir-ees. As adults get older, it becomes harder to shed weight and stay active, she said.
Some UF students formed their own ex-
planations.
UF anthropology junior Karla Aguayo, 
20, said people may consume too many “fad” health items such as energy drinks and protein shakes.
Tim Dupree, a 22-year-old UF accounting 
graduate student, said perhaps some active adults view food as a reward after exercise.
“It’s like, ‘Oh, I just ﬁ  nished working out, 
so now I can have a milkshake,’” he said.

� THE THEATER IS CASH-ONLY.
EMILY BUCHANAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Business is on the rise for a local theater that 
reopened in June and now shows $2 second-run 
movies.
The renovated four-screen theater, Gators 4, 
located at 6741 W. Newberry Road, was once an 
AMC franchise that later changed to Gators Cin-
ema. It closed last year for remodeling, including the replacement of 200 seats, the installation of a digital projector in one of the theaters, painting of the ﬂ  oors and replacement of sewage lines.
“Business is getting busier every week,” said 
Michael O’Brien, the general manager who has worked at Gators 4 for about 15 years while the theater changed hands four times.He said the theater — which accepts cash only

Although the theater is cleaner and in better 
condition, O’Brien said reopening a business is always a challenge. He said the air conditioning unit turns off occasionally, and older equipment is 
starting to rust. But when it comes to competition, 
O’Brien said he believes there isn’t any.
“The only other theaters around here are Regal 
theaters, and we don’t really compete with them,” he said.
Candace Webb, an 18-year-old UF nursing

“It was clean and very affordable,” she said. 
“You can tell the theater is old but well-main-tained.”Cinema reopens, offers $2 tickets

Weekend sewage spills pumped 
more than 900,000 gallons of waste-
water into two local creeks, and Gainesville Regional Utilities is now testing the water quality.
A leak Friday morning and 
a broken pipe joint Saturday let wastewater ﬂ  ow into Hogtown Creek and Possum Creek, said GRU spokeswoman Amelia Bell. 
The system was repaired at 
about 9 p.m. Saturday. The situa-tion was rare, 
and the pipe was new, she said. It was a failure on 
the part of the 
equipment, she said. 
GRU is now 
working to ﬁ  g-ure out what 
went wrong, she said, so it can test or check other parts of its sys-tem. The creek water will be safe in 
about three to ﬁ  ve days, she said. 
Meanwhile, residents should avoid the creeks.
Paul Chadik, a UF associate pro-
fessor of environmental engineering sciences, said the wastewater could 
have contaminated the creeks with 
bacteria and viruses. He advised well owners to boil water before drinking. 
Because of the rapid water 
ﬂ  ow and high oxygen levels in the creeks, Chadik said aquatic life will not be in danger. 
Chadik said the spill was not 
preventable, and GRU responded relatively quickly. GRU responds to weekend sewage spill

Hernandez’s brick premature?
Doomed to repeat it:
The case for a public 
that is in the know
Last Wednesday, the House of Representatives had the 
opportunity to reign in the National Security Agency’s 
power to spy on us.
The amendment was narrowly defeated.
In a country that’s supposed to be the “land of the free,” one 
might think such a motion would have succeeded by a land-
slide. It’s clear that we’re not free as in “freedom.”
No longer are freedoms being destroyed in secrecy. Now 
they are openly rejected without much objection from the public. If asked privately, many will say we’re better off without these measures, but what are the odds that anything will be done about them? It looks like we’re shaping up to do what we’ve always done and vote for the same parties that got us here in the first place, lumbering like drunks from one party to the other.
There is one question that seems to pervade the public men-
tality about the whole matter, and perhaps you have asked it, too: Why bother? Why even bother with the frustration and ef-fort to become informed and vote if it makes no difference, any-way? Damned if you do and damned if you don’t, but at least you’ll get a moment’s peace if you don’t.
We’ll state it as clearly as possible: It is no less than the moral 
duty of every citizen to make the effort. Here’s why.
There have been many atrocities committed throughout the 
course of human history. Hitler was one of the most awful of us; there’s hardly any doubt, but he didn’t accomplish what he did single-handedly. People voted for Hitler. People did as Hitler said. People saw the atrocities and turned the other way. Some didn’t even care to find out what he was up to, placing blind 
faith in their leader. And that’s all it takes.
Perhaps this is what many of us figure — that we can put 
our faith in the “experts,” outsourcing our moral duties to some 
bureaucracy or public figure.
If history had damned the German people as much as it 
damns Hitler, perhaps we’d have taken home a different lesson, and perhaps we’d be living in a very different county and in-deed a different world.
It would be naive to think something that atrocious would 
never happen again while the public remains blithely unin-formed. We are already sowing the seeds for history to damn us.
It was recently revealed that in the country of Pakistan alone, 
our supposed ally, we — we — have killed at least 147 civilians 
— 94 of which were children — in drone strikes between the 
years of 2006 and 2009. And that barely scratches the surface of the issue of drone killings.
Really take a moment to ask yourself what you think about 
that.
The decisions we make here, on our beloved land, are affect-
ing the entire world. The default position should not be to won-der why anyone would bother informing themselves. It should, 
of course, be the opposite. This feeling of powerlessness is a 
trick, and it’s exactly contrary to reality.
Just ask George III.Ballin’ on a budget: summer “vacations”
We are in the dead of summer here in 
Gainesville. 
Sunny days are too humid and hot to spend 
any significant amount of time outside, and rain showers 
are a constant threat to outdoor activities anyway. The op-tions for fun to be had during Florida summers for a col-lege student are limited, and streaming Netflix movies all day can get old quickly.
Up until college, May through August meant sum-
mer camp and family road trips. But now, for many 
of us, summer is nothing more than an opportunity to squeeze in a few extra credits. Summer classes are in-
tensive — many meet up to five days a week — leaving 
little opportunity for a vacation of any kind. Not that we would have been able to if our class schedules allowed it — paying out-of-pocket for summer classes, with no assistance from Bright Futures, has likely left many of 
us with little funds to spend on leisure activities.
Fortunately for you, an empty wallet and a busy 
schedule do not necessarily translate to a vacation-free 
summer. With a little ingenuity and an open mind, you 
can have a fun-filled escape from reality without break-
ing the bank. And here’s how:
Drink a beer in the shower. You may not be able to 
afford to go somewhere that has a hunky, hairless pool boy serving you frozen drinks garnished with little um-
brellas, but that’s not the only way to be wet and drink 
alcohol at the same time. Pop open a beer in the shower — cans or bottles work. I do not recommend drinking your shower beer out of a glass unless you enjoy your 
lager sprinkled with hot water. This works best when 
you have a shelf or some sort of beer platform so you can clean yourself with both hands. Please remember to clean yourself; this vacation isn’t all fun and games. If you’re a serious partier who isn’t afraid to leave lit-
tle hot water left for your roommates, try two shower 
beers.Ask your neighbors if you 
can sleep on their couch. This works best if you know your 
neighbors, but that is not com-
pletely necessary. Simply pack up a bag — just as if you were going on a real vacation! Neat! 
And go knock on their door. 
The beauty here is there isn’t 
that risk of forgetting your phone charger or a tooth-brush at home because if you do, you can just go back over and grab it. Maybe watch a movie with your neigh-
bors. Eat whatever you want out of their fridge when 
they go to bed because this vacation has no ridiculous minibar fees!
Sleep with your head on the opposite side of the 
bed than you normally do. I recommend washing your sheets before doing this as it is the part of the bed that your feet hang out — however, again, not necessary. You may be asking, how is this a vacation? Trust me, sleep-ing with your head where your feet normally go allows 
for a totally different perspective than what you’re used 
to. And isn’t that what vacations are all about? Don’t forget to bring your pillows with you to the other side of the bed, or you may wake up with a stiff neck. That 
would put a damper on your vacation.
Watch the Spanish channel. There is simply no 
cheaper way to visit South America than to watch the 
Spanish channel. Turn the air conditioning off in your house and take your shirt off. You’re now in Cancun — 
live it up.
These are just a few of the innumerable opportunities 
for vacations on a budget. Don’t be afraid to experiment 
and come up with some of your own.

Logan Ladnyk’s ESRB Column
The ESRB ratings system 
is nice and all, but the world 
shouldn’t need it. Parents should take more responsibility, and ac-tually find out what the games about. People are so quick to 
judge a game when something 
goes wrong, but what they should actually be pointing the finger at is the parenting skills. I grew up playing Mortal Kom-bat, and other violent games but I haven’t or will I ever go out 
and start beating people up and 
trying to “finish them.” Video games can inspire and spark the imaginations of anyone who plays them, they are no different than movies or books and I hope 
one day people will see that.
I also enjoyed reading the col-
umn, it’s nice to see some speak-
ing about video games outside of the “Internet.”
Travis ThorntonLetter to the EditorEleven days. Tuesday-Wednesday-
Thursday-Friday-Saturday-Sunday-Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday-
Thursday-Friday.
That’s all that’s left of this semester. 
First and foremost, to those who will be 
graduating, I stand and applaud you for 
making it through your time here. If you will not be moving on to a higher degree, come visit once the Hub and Reitz Union are renovated.
For the freshmen who enrolled early 
— good on you for doing so — and are almost done with your ﬁ  rst semester, 
hopefully the accelerated pace of summer 
prepared you for Fall and Spring. This gig will get somewhat easier but to quote Mad-Eye Moody from the “Harry Potter” series: CONSTANT VIGILANCE! I speak from experience when I say it’s extremely easy to get lax and take your foot off the gas just enough to fall behind.
To those who are struggling in classes, 
the deadline to withdraw is Friday. Before exercising that option, I would recom-mend talking with your professors to see if you’re actually lagging behind. I thought I had a grade of 55 in Reporting before talk-ing to professor Mike Foley. I have at least a 73.5. If I had not done that, I would have withdrawn from a class I was passing.
If there was ever a time to ﬁ  nd another 
gear, this is it. A shorter semester means each grade counts more in the long run, so ﬁ  nishing strong is important. If our football team can go through practices in this god-forsaken Florida sun, then the least we can do is study in air-conditioned rooms and give our best for just 11 more days.
But giving your best doesn’t mean 
overworking yourself and burning out 
just before a ﬁ  nal exam. Work at a moder-
ate pace, if you have the luxury to do so. Take some time to de-stress yourself by hanging out with friends or something as simple as slowly enjoying your fa-vorite meal. Even play some video games. I’ve writ-
ten about them 
so much this se-mester I’d be re-miss in ignoring them now.
Keep moving forward, even if it seems 
everyone else is moving forward faster. You got into UF because you’re good at what you do, whether  it be math, the-
ater, animation, writing or something else 
equally hard to master. This isn’t Santa Fe College; we’re a prestigious university with strict standards —  not to take any-thing away from SFC, though. My ﬁ  rst two years of higher education were there, and I thoroughly enjoyed both my classes and the atmosphere.
As an aside, please ﬁ  ll out course eval-
uations if you have time. They actually do make differences for later classes. Mul-timedia Reporting is a terrible, terrible, terrible — I cannot stress how terrible the class itself is, even if it’s taught by someone who is in agreement with how terrible it is —  class and is ﬁ  nally getting revamped for Fall semester. The reason it is getting the revamp is because of all the negative 
feedback from evaluations to recommen-
dations from the college’s advisory coun-cil.
It’s the two-minute warning, the bot-
tom of the ninth inning, the white ﬂ  ag is waving for the ﬁ  nal lap.
Eleven days. Tuesday-Wednesday-
Thursday-Friday-Saturday-Sunday-Mon-day-Tuesday-Wednesday-Thursday-Fri-
day.
You got this. I got this. We all got this.

opinions@alligator.orgChris Christie has recently made head-
lines by demonstrating just how much hot air his bloated balloon of 
a body can release at once. After a proposal to restrict how the National Security Agency 
can collect phone records was narrowly de-
feated last week, Christie went off on a tan-gent attempting to smear any inﬂ  uence lib-ertarianism has had on both of the two major parties. “I just want us to be really cautious, because this strain of libertarianism that’s go-ing through both parties right now and mak-ing big headlines, I think, is a very dangerous thought,” Christie said.
The proposal aimed at narrowing the 
NSA’s reach garnered support from Rep. Justin Amash, R-Mich., and his political po-lar opposite, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich. The fact that both liberal stalwarts and libertar-ians came together to support a bill like this is evidence of the ever-growing popularity of the liberty movement.
When asked whether Christie was includ-
ing Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., in his anti-liberty arguments, he responded by saying, “You can name any number of people who have engaged in it, and he’s one of them. These esoteric, intellectual debates — I want them to come to New Jersey and sit across from the widows and the orphans and have that conversation.”
Well, if any libertarian explained the fol-
lies of an interventionist foreign policy to the widows and orphans in New Jersey, that would be a step in the right direction. In fact, the United States employs a foreign policy that makes us less safe and prone to attacks like Benghazi and 9/11. 
Radicalized people around the world do 
not hate America because we are free, rich and prosperous but because our government supports global military imperialism instead of peace and commerce. Christie could se-riously use a libertarian lesson on foreign policy.
Not only has 
Christie displayed his control-freak, big government 
tendencies regard-
ing foreign policy, but he has also displayed them at home. It was only 
recently that Christie decided New Jersey residents were competent enough to pump their own gas. In the past, self-serve has been illegal. Christie repealed these laws on that 
assumption that it would lower gas prices. If 
Christie really wanted to lower gas prices, he would do something about the 49.5-cent per gallon tax embedded in our gasoline prices.
Despite being a proud member of the 
GOP who spews pro-business, small gov-ernment rhetoric, Christie has a history of chastising business owners in his own state. After Hurricane Sandy devastated New Jer-
sey, Christie went on an all-out statist assault 
against “price gougers.” Christie wanted to crack down on those evil businessmen and businesswomen who sought to charge prices they named for the goods they owned. The rise in the cost of goods during a disaster is actually a good thing because it ensures goods are spread evenly among consumers as opposed to one entity buying them all at 
once. This is a free-market mechanism de-
signed to properly distribute goods in high demand during an emergency.
If Chris Christie is going to engage in an-
other one of his public temper tantrums, it should be one that endlessly apologizes for 
supporting a pro-war, imperialist foreign 
policy, babying people at the gas pump and punishing the businessmen and business-women of New Jersey.

UF nabbed a spot on Forbes’ list of 
America’s 100 top colleges.
UF jumped from 80th to 74th place be-
tween 2012 and 2013, making it 41st in re-
search and 11th overall in the South. 
UF was the only school in Florida to 
make the top 100, and among the SEC 
schools on the list, it ranked second just be-
hind Vanderbilt University.
“I’m always going to think we should be 
ranked higher,” UF spokesman Steve Or-lando said. “I think UF is a terriﬁ  c school, 
and a lot of people recognize that.”
People should notice that UF is climb-ing, Orlando said. 
Graduation rates are growing, and there 
is increasing interest in UF graduates from 
employers, he said.
Forbes created its list based on ﬁ  ve fac-
tors: student satisfaction, post-graduation success, student debt, four-year graduation rate and nationally competitive awards.
UF advertising junior David “Tres” 
Moore, 21, said he thinks UF has a lot more to be proud of.
“An SEC college sports atmosphere is 
something only 14 schools in the entire 
world can understand,” he said. “Then there 
is our solid Greek life, tons of cool places to eat, and all sorts of bars and clubs.”According to UF’s website, 96 percent of 
freshmen return for their sophomore year. Two-thirds of UF graduates leave the uni-versity with no student loan debt. Sixty-ﬁ  ve percent of UF freshmen graduate in four years and 83 percent graduate in six years.8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, JULY 30, 2013

In the two years since Main 
Street underwent a multimil-
lion dollar construction project, 
downtown travel has become 
signiﬁ  cantly safer, according to city ofﬁ  cials. 
The city’s Public Works De-
partment recently submitted a report comparing crash and trafﬁ  c statistics from before the construction to after the changes were made, said City Commis-
sioner Thomas Hawkins. Hawkins said accidents on 
Main Street have been reduced 
by about 85 percent since the con-
struction, which widened side-
walks, added street parking and consolidated trafﬁ  c lanes.
“Why consider trafﬁ  c acci-
dents any different from other 
kinds of threats to public safety?” 
he said. “Imagine if we could do something to reduce homi-cides by 85 percent. We’re sav-
ing people trips to the emergency 
room, saving money and making Gainesville a better place.”
Hawkins said that while re-ducing trafﬁ  c lanes helped, the major difference came from add-ing parking and bike lanes, and widening sidewalks on Main 
Street.
“In pretty much every mea-
sure, we added and things got bigger and better throughout the 
process,” he said. “Walking is 
important, and I want to be able 
to walk [downtown].”
Tom Fox, a member of 
Gainesville Downtown Owners 
and Tenants, has advocated for 
the construction on Main Street for more than a decade. He said pedestrians and bicyclists have beneﬁ  ted from the changes.
“That’s one thing about add-
ing the street parking to Main,” he said. “At two in the morning with hundreds of people leav-
ing the bars, getting in their cars 
and speeding next to hundreds of people on sidewalks, [street parking] gives a barrier of cars between the people and the mov-ing trafﬁ  c.”
Some complaints about trafﬁ  c 
center around losing some down-town trafﬁ  c lanes, Fox said. 
Even if trafﬁ  c increased slight-
ly since construction, Fox said, Main Street is the scene of fewer accidents, and downtown busi-ness is up because more pedestri-ans are willing to walk.
“With the lane reduction, peo-
ple end up driving the speed lim-it, which makes it safer for people walking back and forth,” he said. 
“It’s not an appropriate place for 
a highway. Downtown should be a place you want to drive to, not drive through.”

Even in Gainesville, a girl is “tipsy,” 
but a man is “tanked.”
A recent survey found college stu-
dents tend to relate moderate terms to 
women who are heavily intoxicated more than they do to men. The survey, published in the journal “Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research,” 
showed students were likely to label a 
women’s drunkenness with words such as “tipsy,” while men’s drinking tends to be described with words that are more aggressive, such as “wasted.” The survey included 145 college students
Ricky Cutler, a 19-year-old advertis-
ing junior, said she thinks the survey re-sults sound about right. She said there’s 
a double standard against women.
“Women are held at a high standard 
in the way society expects us to behave in 
public,” Cutler said. “A girl being drunk or sloppy in public looks much worse than a guy doing the same thing.”
According to the survey, research-
ers asked students to read a story that involved two men and two women cel-ebrating a main character’s birthday in a bar. In each story, researchers switched the sex of the main character, how much he or she drank and how this person 
behaved. Study participants rated on a 
scale from 1 to 5 how well four sensible or 11 hefty drinking terms applied to the main character, according to Live-Science. 
Results showed that sensible terms 
were given more to the female charac-ters — even when they were heavily drinking.
GatorWell Director Maureen Miller 
said that culture and society are usually in connection when labeling genders. 
“There is always a different meaning 
for different students and their drink-ing behavior,” Miller said. “But when it comes to gender expectation, I think cul-tural and social implications also come into play.”
Miller said it could be dangerous for 
college students when incorrectly label-ing someone as “wasted” or “tipsy.”
“I always want to remind students 
who see other students that look past the point of ‘tipsy’ to step in and do the right thing,” Miller said.Drunkenness terms unequalLIFESTYLE

UF Hillel received two paintings by art 
duo Frank Martin and Judeen Young on 
Wednesday in honor of the 65th anniversary of the Israel Air Force.
Both paintings are of aircrafts, and they 
signify the creation of Israel defense forces in the Israeli War of Independence in 1948.
The art will be on display for four to six 
months at the Hillel, according to 20th Cen-tury Aviation Magazine’s website.
“We’re very pleased to have these,” said 
Ralph Lowenstein, a veteran of Israel’s 1948 War of Independence and dean emeritus of UF’s College of Journalism and Communica-tions. “It’s very well done. The art is superb.”
At the age of 18, Lowenstein served as one 
of the youngest American volunteers in the war. He took a semester off from Columbia University in the summer of 1948 to contrib-ute to the war, where he was smuggled into Israel and put into combat 10 days later. 
“The paintings depict some of the aircrafts used to win that war,” he said.  
Lowenstein was one of three who were 
present to receive the paintings. Keith Dvor-chik, CEO and executive director of the UF Hillel and Gail Swedroe, assistant director and campus rabbi, were also there.
The artworks are represented by Steven 
Greenwald Design. John Stemple of Aviation Promotions Inc. and J.R. Hafer of 20th Cen-tury Aviation Magazine delivered them to the Hillel, the website said. 
“John Stemple arranged to have two 
paintings donated to our Aliyah Bet mu-seum,” said Blair DeLaet, office manager of 
the Hillel. 
The display includes an explanatory panel 
giving details about the paintings, she said. 
“Hillel is very lucky and honored to be 
displaying this artwork,” DeLaet said. “We haven’t had anything added in quite some-
time, so it will definitely add a new perspec-
tive for people to come in and view.”Paintings at Hillel honor Israel

practices for fans on Aug. 15, Aug. 17, Aug. 19 and Aug. 20. The Gators begin fall camp on Aug. 2.UF removed Aaron Hernandez’s All-American brick from outside The Swamp. Read the column

  Former Gator All-American 
swimmers Ryan Lochte and Melani 
Costa-Schmid both earned silver 
medals on Sunday during the ﬁ  rst 
day of competition at the 15th FINA World Championships in Barce-lona. 
  Lochte, an 11-time Olympic 
medalist for the United States, add-ed to his resume by capturing his 20th long-course World Champion-ships medal, second to only Michael 
Phelps’ 33. 
  His 4x100-meter freestyle re-
lay team clocked in at 3:11.42, just 
0.24 seconds behind the ﬁ  rst-place 
French team. 
  Lochte will also compete in the 
200-meter free ﬁ  nal today at noon. 
As the No. 2 seed with a time of 1:46.06, Lochte will compete with 
former Gator and 2012 Olympian 
Conor Dwyer (USA), who is the No. 6 seed (1:47.05)  They will share the pool again 
for the 400-meter individual medley during the ﬁ  nal day of competition on Aug 4. Lochte enters the event with the top seed and a qualifying time of 1:54.90.
  Costa-Schmid, a two-time Span-
ish Olympian, posted a 4:02.47 in the 400-meter free, ﬁ  nishing in second. Her performance bested her semiﬁ  -nal showing by 1.73 seconds and set a new Spanish national record.
  They are joined by a group of 
All-Americans, including former Gator Jemma Lowe (Great Britain), junior Elizabeth Beisel (USA), ju-nior Hilda Luthersdottir (Iceland), freshman Sinead Russell (Canada) and sophomore Dan Wallace (Great Britain).
  All but Wallace are former 
Olympians.
  Although Beisel’s qualifying time 
for the 200-meter individual medley 
(2:11.16) was the fourth fastest, she 
ﬁ  nished 12th in the semiﬁ  nals with a time of 2:11.69. 
  She will compete again in the 
400-meter individual medley on the 
last day of the meet.
  A mere 0.02 seconds separated 
Lowe from the ﬁ  nals in the 100-me-
ter butterﬂ  y as her 58.46 was good 
enough for 9th. 
  Lowe wasn’t the only one to 
miss the ﬁ  nal cut as Russell ﬁ  nished 
her semiﬁ  nal 100-meter backstroke in 9th. However, she still has the 
50-meter back on Wednesday and 
200-meter back on Friday.
  Luthersdottir ﬁ  nished 30th in 
the 100-meter breaststroke (1:09.75), 
nearly breaking her Icelandic na-
tional record by 0.27 seconds. She will swim next in the 200-meter breast on Thursday.

  Three days after landing his 
ﬁ  rst 2015 commit, Will Mus-
champ missed out on a four-
star talent.
  Sherrod Pittman, a 6-foot-1, 
215-pound outside linebacker out of Jacksonville First Coast 
High verbally committed to 
South Carolina over Florida during a local television ap-
pearance on CBS47 and FOX30 
at 6:20 p.m. on Monday.
  Pittman announced via his 
Twitter account (@ROLLING-
HARD_9) on Sunday that he 
had narrowed down his choices to UF and South Carolina. 
  ESPN ranks Pittman as the 
162nd best player in the Class of 2015 and the 22nd best re-cruit in the state.
  According to MaxPreps.
com, Pittman tallied 7.4 tackles per game during his sopho-more campaign in 2012. He also forced three fumbles and recorded three sacks as the Buc-caneers went 10-1.  
  If Pittman chose Florida, he 
would have teamed up with former First Coast teammate 
and fellow linebacker Daniel 
McMillian, who will begin his ﬁ  rst season with the Gators this year.
  D e s p i t e 
missing out on Pittman, UF received 
a commit-ment on Friday from 
f o u r - s t a r 
wide receiv-er Da’Vante 
Phillips after Florida’s annual Friday Night Lights camp at 
Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. Phil-
lips, a 6-foot-1, 189-pound Mi-ami native, is ranked 11th in the Class of 2015 by ESPN.
  The Gators currently have 
12 verbal commits for the Class of 2014 and two for 2016.

 I  grew up with baseball as the No. 1 sport in 
my house. My dad watched baseball. My mom watched baseball. My grandparents watched 
baseball.
  My entire family moved down to South Florida 
from New York and brought their love for baseball with them.
  But when I went to school, baseball was the third 
most popular sport at best. The Dolphins were al-ways the most popular team, and the Heat got plenty of attention before LeBron took his talents to South Beach.
  It seemed like baseball was an afterthought to 
a lot of my classmates. The one exception came in 2003, when the Marlins made an improbable run to a World Series championship. I didn’t hear the end 
of it. 
  That lasted about two weeks.
  Ten years later, baseball needs something to re-
vive its popularity in South Florida. The Marlins certainly aren’t doing it. I have come up with some steps Major League Baseball and the Marlins should 
do to try to bring baseball to the forefront.
Step 1: Get rid of Jeff Loria. If you’re any kind of 
baseball fan, this should seem like the obvious ﬁ  rst 
step. 
  Loria is inarguably the worst owner in baseball, 
and he is credited with making the Montreal Expos so unviable that the team needed to move to Wash-ington, D.C.
  Loria escaped the Ex-
pos’ downfall and bought 
the Marlins and turned 
the franchise into a joke. He cheated Miami out of the money for a new sta-
dium with the promise of 
a competitive team, then traded away nearly all of 
the team’s established talent.
  Two ﬁ  resales in the last 10 years have left the 
fan base disillusioned. How can fans be expected to shell out their hard-earned money for a team with an owner who clearly doesn’t care about the product he puts out on the ﬁ  eld?
  If I was a Marlins fan, I don’t think I could bring 
myself to take a step near Marlins Park as long as Loria owns the team.
  Step 2: Move the Marlins to the American League 
Eastern Division. Major League Baseball has few qualms about teams switching leagues. The Brewers 
did it in the 90s, and the Astros did it last year. 
  Moving to the AL East could bring more fans to 
the stadium. South Florida is full of Northern trans-
plants who still support their Yankees and Red Sox. 
Playing each of those teams would bring thousands 
down to Miami for those games. And who knows?  Steps to revive Marlins’ popularity

WHAT TO EXPECT
 Although you might not 
have known, the Univer-sity of Florida has more 
sports to offer other than foot-ball.
  The Swamp may be the most 
iconic venue on campus, and the 
football team might be the most 
visible squad, but Florida has 
16 other varsity teams – most of 
which compete for championships annually.
  Some of the notable teams are:  Men’s basketball: The most visible team 
besides football, the men’s basketball program has been one of the most successful Florida 
teams in the past decade. 
  The men’s basketball team is coached by 
Billy Donovan, who led the team to back-to-
back titles in 2006 and 2007.
  However, the Gators haven’t enjoyed the 
same level of success in the NCAA Tourna-ment the past few years.
  After two appearances in the second-tier 
tournament, the NIT, the Gators made three 
deep tournament runs, only to fall in the Elite 
Eight each time.
  Last year, after beating Northwestern State, 
Minnesota and Cinderella-squad Florida Gulf 
Coast, Florida took a beating at the hands of 
Michigan, losing 79-59.
  The blowout was the last game for three 
Florida seniors – Kenny Boynton, Erik Mur-
phy and Mike Rosario. The three were the 
Gators’ top scorers.
  Now, Florida looks to reload with several 
returning players such as center Patric Young, 
transfers and new recruits, including ﬁ  ve-star point guard Kasey Hill.
  The men’s basketball team plays its home 
games in the O’Connell Center, also known as 
the “O-Dome.”
  Gymnastics: The Florida gymnastics team 
was arguably UF’s best team last year. Coached by Rhonda Faehn, the gymnastics team went 
15-2 last season and won the national title for 
the ﬁ  rst time in the program’s history.
  Six gymnasts combined for 16 All-America 
honors, which tied a UF record. Freshman 
Bridget Sloan won an individual NCAA title 
in all around and beam. Junior Alaina Johnson took home the uneven bars individual cham-
pionship.
  The gymnastics team draws large crowds 
at the O’Connell Center, where it competes in 
the spring.
  Lacrosse: The women’s lacrosse program is 
the newest at Florida. The lacrosse team has only played four seasons – all under coach 
Amanda O’Leary – but it quickly became a 
top team.
  Lacrosse is the only team at UF that does 
not play in the Southeastern Conference. Only two SEC teams have a women’s lacrosse team 
(Vanderbilt is the other), and both schools play 
in the American Lacrosse Conference, which 
also includes Johns Hopkins, Penn State and 
Ohio State, among others. Florida has ﬁ  nished 
ﬁ  rst in the ALC standings the last three years.  The lacrosse team made it 
within a goal of the national title 
game two seasons ago – the pro-
gram’s third year of existence. 
  Last season, the team fell 
short and was eliminated in the 
NCAA Quarterﬁ  nals.
  The lacrosse team plays in 
Donald R. Dizney Stadium, 
which is located on Hull Road.
  Soccer: The UF women’s soccer team has 
also been very successful in its history, despite 
being relatively new.
  The program began in 1995 under Becky 
Burleigh, who still leads the team. Last year, 
the team went 19-5-1 while winning both the 
SEC regular season and tournament titles. However, the Gators fell in the third round of the NCAA Tournament.
  Florida won the national title in 1998. That 
year’s team included the two most prominent alumni from the program – Heather Mitts and 
Abby Wambach. The latter has scored more 
international goals than any other women’s 
soccer player.
  The women’s soccer team plays at James 
G. Pressly Stadium on Stadium Road next to 
McKethan Stadium.
  Softball: The softball team had an unex-
pectedly good season. Coach Tim Walton’s 
squad was picked to ﬁ  nish fourth in the SEC 
East, but instead won the division, the regular 
season title and the tournament title en route 
to the team’s ﬁ  fth appearance in the Women’s College World Series.
  Florida lost in Oklahoma City, but has a 
strong chance to repeat or improve on its per-
formance. The Gators lost only two players – 
outﬁ  elder Kelsey Horton and reserve Ensley 
Gammel.
  Softball plays at Katie Seashole Pressly Sta-
dium on Hull Road, right across from Dizney Stadium.
  Track and Field: Both the men’s and wom-
en’s track and ﬁ  eld squads have been success-
ful the last few years.
  The men’s team won its second straight 
outdoor title. Coach Mike Holloway has 
picked up three national titles in the past two 
years – two outdoor championships and one indoor championship.
  The track team competes at the Percy Beard 
Track that surrounds James G. Pressly Stadi-
um.
  There are several other popular teams at 
UF. The baseball team routinely draws 3,000 or more fans and has been to the College 
World Series in three of the past four seasons. 
However, after losing several top players, the 
Gators ﬁ  nished 29-30 after eking their way 
into the NCAA Tournament. 
  So while you obsess over the football team, 
make sure to devote some time to smaller sports. The games are free for students, and 
they’re usually worth your time.

Miami should move to AL East, stoke rivalry with Tampa Bay
Maybe some start supporting 
their hometown team, and some of their kids start rooting for the 
team that’s right around the ﬁ  gu-
rative corner. Kids like rebelling against their parents, right?
  Also, moving to the AL East 
can help foster a real rivalry with Tampa Bay. 
  The Marlins always played the 
Rays as part of the whole rivalry weekend thing MLB did during interleague play. The Yankees 
played the Mets, the Cubs played 
the White Sox – those are real ri-valries. Marlins-Rays never had any of that hype.
  But if the two teams played 
each other more than a dozen times per season and competed 
for a division title, a little enmity 
might develop.
  Step 3: Appeal to the suburbs. 
The Marlins have a much bigger 
market to exploit than just the Mi-
ami area. 
  Broward County, Palm Beach 
County, Martin County and St. Lucie County have a total popu-
lation of nearly 3.5 million people within two hours of Marlins Park. Ft. Myers and Naples are also 
about two hours away.
  If the Marlins gave these poten-
tial fans a reason to get in the car 
and drive, there’s a huge number 
of people who are near enough to at least occasionally go to games.
  Miami tried to brand itself 
with a new color scheme and 
theme song (“We are the Marlins! Go Fish!”), and it didn’t work. The Marlins need to appeal to 
as broad of an audience as pos-sible without the tackiness they brought in a few years ago.
  If they follow some of these 
steps, then maybe Miami won’t regret ﬁ  nancing that behemoth of a stadium.

AS STEIN ON TV
 Aaron Hernandez was an All-Ameri-
can in 2009.
  Regardless of what UF does with 
the brick it removed from outside the James W. “Bill” Heavener Complex on Thursday morning, Hernandez was an All-American that year.
  The idea of scrubbing players, wins and 
titles from history has always seemed a little absurd – in fact, almost Orwellian – to me. I still remember USC beating Oklahoma for the championship, and I recall a certain 
Penn State coach winning a lot of games, 
even if his statue is gone.
  But UF removing Hernandez’s All-
American brick now is premature, and it 
shows what Hernandez – and all players – 
are once they leave: free advertising.
  Let me ﬁ  rst say that Hernandez’s alleged 
crime is heinous. It’s disgusting and should offend anyone with any human decency. If 
he’s found guilty, lock him up and throw 
away the key.  But he hasn’t been found guilty, yet. So 
why remove the brick now? UF got rid of it because Hernandez makes them look bad.
  Florida wants everyone to forget he wore 
orange and blue for three years. SportsCen-ter can show him in a Patriots uniform now, and I’m sure Bernie Machen, Jeremy Foley 
and Will Muschamp want it to stay that 
way.
  The University Athletic Association con-
victed Hernandez months before he will face trial.
  What harm would leaving the brick up 
cause? Hernandez isn’t involved with Flor-ida anymore. He doesn’t coach or play in Gainesville.
  The Patriots releasing him is understand-
able – it’s hard to place a player on the depth chart when he’s in prison. But Hernandez had little to no involvement with UF.
  Florida got rid of the brick because it 
doesn’t want to advertise that a possible murderer, who was coincidentally a great tight end, walked into The Swamp.
  Florida wants 
fans to remember Tim Tebow and those two titles in 2006 and 2008. 
And while you’re 
basking in that 
nostalgia, just hand over your money. What was in that empty space? Don’t worry about it. Here’s your ticket.
  It wants recruits to think of Joe Haden, 
Carlos Dunlap and the Pounceys. If you come play for Florida, you’re going to the NFL. Don’t worry about that Hernandez 
guy.
  College football is a business, and UF is 
in it to make money. That shouldn’t come as 
a surprise to anyone. Leaving Hernandez’s name outside the stadium was bad busi-
ness, so now it’s gone.
  But what if Hernandez is actually acquit-ted? He has a lot of money and can afford 
a strong defense. Maybe the jury will be made up of wicked diehard Pats fans. You 
never know. 
Without the evidence right in front of 
me, I can’t say he deﬁ  nitely won’t be acquit-
ted.
  If Hernandez is found not guilty, what 
happens to the brick? Does UF just put it back and say, “Oops, my bad”?
  But no matter what UF, the NCAA and 
the criminal justice system do to Hernan-
dez, trying to pretend he was never here is 
ridiculous.
  If the UAA wants to scrub anything, they 
should take a gander at Hernandez’s Gator-
zone proﬁ  le. There are some choice remarks 
there, such as current running backs coach Brian White’s 2009 quote:
  “In 23 years of coaching, he’s probably 
the smartest player I’ve been around,”

JAGUARS

  JACKSONVILLE — Jason Babin 
raised his eyebrows in disbelief and 
then repeated the number just to make sure he heard it correctly.
  “Twenty-four sacks a season?” 
he asked. “No. For real?”
  Yep. The Jacksonville Jaguars 
have the most inept pass rush in the league over the last ﬁ  ve years, total-
ing 120 sacks while changing play-
ers, coaches and schemes.
  Maybe new head coach/de-
fensive guru Gus Bradley can turn things around.
  Players certainly have bought 
into Bradley’s defensive design. They insist there’s better talent and more depth at the tackle and end po-
sitions, and believe the aggressive, 
bump-and-run style at cornerback could disrupt timing between quar-terbacks and receivers and possibly pay dividends.
  “We’re going to be able to cover, we’re going to be able to rush and we’re going to be able to stop the run,” Babin said. “Everyone always 
says those marquee things. But these 
guys are genuine. These guys are 
true. The players have bought into and are willing to sacriﬁ  ce and do whatever it takes to succeed.”
  The Jaguars have failed so many 
times in recent years to generate more pressure.
  They whiffed by drafting defen-
sive ends Derrick Harvey and Quen-tin Groves in the ﬁ  rst and second rounds, respectively, in 2008. They 
got even less out of free agent Aaron 
Kampman, who signed a four-year contract worth $25 million in 2010 but never fully recovered from tear-ing ligaments in both knees.
  They used their top four draft 
picks on defensive linemen that same year, but none has panned out.
  They even brought in the Cana-
dian Football League’s Most Out-standing Defensive Player (John Chick) with the hope that he could ﬁ  nd similar success in the NFL.
  Chick ﬁ  nished with 2 1/2 sacks 
in 19 games — not bad for the Jag-
uars.
  Jacksonville’s 120 sacks over the 
last ﬁ  ve seasons is seven fewer than 
the next closest team, Kansas City, and nearly 100 behind NFL lead-ers Pittsburgh (218) and Minnesota (218).
  Sure, sack totals can be overrat-
ed. But pressuring quarterbacks and making them uncomfortable in the 
pocket are key to defensive success 
in the NFL these days.
  Players and coaches point out 
all the moving parts in the pro-cess: stopping the run, pushing the pocket from the middle, covering receivers and getting help from the offense. The Jaguars struggled to do 
those last season, thus ranking 30th 
in the league in total defense.
  With an inability to cover receiv-
ers in one-on-one situations, Jackson-
ville played mostly zone defense in 2012, trying to get to opposing QBs with a four-man rush while playing a bend-but-don’t-break defense.
  The Jaguars ﬁ  nished with a 
league-low 20 sacks, the third-low-est total in franchise history.
  “Everybody wants to blame 
the edge rushers,” defensive end Jeremy Mincey said. “That’s a mis-conception. An edge rusher ain’t nothing without a pocket pusher. If the pocket’s not getting pressed and 
pushed and caved in, it don’t matter 
if there’s an edge rush or not. All the quarterback has to do is step up and make plays.”
  Mincey has a point. After all, the 
Jaguars dumped defensive tackles Terrance Knighton and C.J. Mosley, and moved former top-10 pick Ty-son Alualu to defensive end. They signed Roy Miller and Sen’Derrick 
Marks in free agency and claimed 
Brandon Deaderick and Kyle Love 
off waivers from New England.
  If those guys can create more 
middle push, it could help the ends. Still, the Jaguars are counting on Alualu to make strides in his new position, Mincey to be more consis-
tent, 33-year-old Babin to return to 
his old form (18 sacks in 2011) and second-year pro Andre Branch to take a signiﬁ  cant step in his devel-
opment.
  If they can’t get it done, the Jag-
uars probably will be right where 
they’ve been the last ﬁ  ve years — down in sacks and still searching for 
a solution.
  “There may be times where 
we’ve got to get creative if we don’t 
feel it to the level that we want,” 
Bradley said. “I think that’s on us as 
coaches to make sure we utilize our best rushers.”
