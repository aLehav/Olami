est. 1997est. 1906
est. 1926on the MapEarning a SpotIn the second week of September, South 
Florida went into a hostile Southeastern 
Conference environment and emerged with a 
win. 
Quarterback Matt Grothe hit receiver Jessie 
Hester Jr. for a 14-yard touchdown, clinching 
the program’s signature victory — a 26-23 over -
time triumph against then-No. 17 Auburn. 
The Bulls put themselves in the national 
spotlight for the first time in their six-year FBS history when they became the fastest upstart to 
earn a spot in the Associated Press poll, debut-
ing at No. 23.
Four games later, South Florida was 6-0 and 
ranked No. 2 in the first edition of the 2007 BCS 
rankings. Florida was ranked No. 15 in the same 
poll, and Miami and Florida State were nowhere 
to be found. 
Though they  finished the season unranked 
after suffering a fourth loss in their bowl game, the Bulls added Tampa to the map of college football schools in the state of Florida. 
“I’m not surprised by any of the success,” 
said UF defensive line coach Dan McCarney , who held the same position at USF in 2007. “I was there. I saw it. I saw the talent, 98 percent of that team is from the state of Florida. We all 
know the talent that’s in this state, and it’s a team and a program to be reckoned with every 
Saturday this season, no matter’s who’s playing 
them.”
The Bulls will again try to beat an SEC school 
on the road in the second week of September 
and put their names in the same sentence as 
their intrastate BCS conference peers, some-
thing they have had mixed results at so far. 
Miami has defeated USF both times 
the schools have 
played, but the Bulls are 11-0 in all other in-state contests. Most of those wins came against teams 
outside the Big Three, but its most recent victo-
ry came against Florida State in Tallahassee. In 
the first-ever meeting between the two schools, 
freshman quarterback B.J. Daniels, a four-star 
recruit out of Tallahassee, led the Bulls to a 17-7 road victory. The Seminoles amassed only 19 
rushing yards, and coach Bobby Bowden ad-
mitted to being caught off guard by the Bulls’ potency. 
‘’The way we got beat up on offense, I didn’t 
know we could get beat up like that,’’ Bowden 
said after the game. ‘’They did everything faster 
than I thought.’’ 
With UF and USF also meeting for the first time Saturday , Florida’s coaching staff is using 
Bowden and FSU’s surprise as a cautionary 
tale.
“They went up and completely dominated 
that game, so we don’t have to fabricate some-
thing fake about the talent and the program and 
the respect we have for them,” McCarney said. 
“This is an outstanding football team coming in 
here, and we’re going to have to play a lot better 
than we did last week [against Miami (Ohio)].” 
A 1-11 MAC team, USF is not. 
FSU learned that first hand, 
as Daniels threw for two 
touchdowns against the 
Seminoles. Daniels is the face of a young squad 
that has lost most of the key contributors from the 2007 season, and he perfectly represents the type of player South Florida builds its team 
around. The 6-foot-1, 203-pound dual-threat 
quarterback was a Florida kid with plenty of 
talent overlooked by the state’s powerhouse 
programs. 
UF recruiting coordinator and running backs 
coach Stan Drayton said the Gators haven’t had 
a problem losing recruits to the Bulls. But South 
Florida does a good job holding onto players 
from Hillsborough County, such as four-star 
cornerback Terrence Mitchell, who went to Hillsborough High and chose USF instead of Miami and FSU. 
“Traditionally, they’re a very aggressive re-
cruiting staff,” Drayton said. “They do a great job there in their back yard, down in Hillsborough County, which has been a hotbed for us as well. So when you come across those guys they have 
an attraction to some of those home bodies 
down there. We bump heads with them a little bit, not a whole lot, but on certain kids.”
UF center Mike Pouncey went to Lakeland High and lived about 
20 minutes from USF’s campus, 
but he never considered the school among the 
state’s elite when he was in high school.
“I was recruited by them, but there was nev-
er a thought in my mind to go there,” Pouncey said. “I wanted to go to a big-time program.”
Heading into their 14th season, the Bulls 
have never won the Big East Conference title or finished with more than nine wins. For all the 
respect the Gators have shown them this week, 
it would be hard to call the Bulls “big-time” in the sense Pouncey meant. 
But new coach Skip Holtz, the second coach 
in school history , will be charged with taking 
the team to that level. It’s respectable how far 
the Bulls have come in such a short time, but it will take wins against FSU, Florida and Miami 
to eventually turn the Big Three into the Big 
Four. 
As for how close USF is to making that leap, 
it’s a matter of perspective. 
“To the people at Florida, it would be that 
extreme if we were to win, yes,” Holtz said ear -
lier this week. “From where we want to build 
this program, for the people on the inside, no, it 
wouldn’t be that extreme. That’s where we have 
the expectation level. Are we there yet? That’s 
why we’re playing the game. We’ll see.” 
USF will take the field as more 
than a two-touchdown un-derdog fighting to be includ-
ed in the conversation with their neighbors to the north, east and south. 
For the Gators, Saturday will be just another 
non-conference game against a team hungry to 
prove it belongs against a top-10 foe. 
“I think it’s more that they want us a lot, a 
lot,” UF senior Ahmad Black said. “They feel 
like if they can come in and beat us, they can 
say they beat one of the elite teams, and it’s our 
job to get focused and be ready to take their best shot.”
If USF can pull off the upset, Bulls fans will 
party like its 2007, when boastful supporters pointed to their lofty BCS ranking and claimed the fledgling program from Tampa was now the 
best team in the state.
“To be considered the best, you have to beat 
all the teams in Florida,” Black said. “So without 
beating us, they can’t be considered the best.”
If the Bulls come away with a victory , a 1-0 
record will be enough for their fans to say the same thing about UF and FSU.Editor Anthony Chiang    ◗  Cover Illustration Alexander Silva

As a media hailstorm descended upon 
Gainesville to cover the planned actions of the 
Dove World Outreach Center over the past 
few days, Saturday’s Quran burning seesawed Thursday from going on as planned, to cancel-
lation and ultimately to suspension.
Major media outlets were reporting Thurs-
day night that the church was going to wait 24 hours before making a decision about the 
Quran burning.
According to reports, Associate Pastor Wayne Sapp said the church was waiting to 
confirm a meeting in New York City between Terry Jones, pastor of the church, and Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, the Muslim leader heading the the plans to build an Islamic center near 
ground zero.
The event had been canceled Thursday af-ternoon, with Jones announcing he had been assured by Rauf that the Islamic center would 
be moved farther away from ground zero.
The announcement was soon after refuted 
by Rauf and Imam Muhammad Musri, presi-dent of the Islamic Society of Central Florida, after which Jones publicly stated he was lied to and he was reconsidering the burning.
With uncertainty looming over the burning, 
law enforcement officials have not changed 
plans for increased security.
“As it stands right now, we are still oper -
ating as normal,” said Gainesville Police De-
partment spokeswoman Cpl. Tscharna Senn Thursday evening.
GPD Staff Specialist Sharon Wooding said 
the department has been working for weeks to prepare a security plan.
“Preparations have been under way for 
more than a month with numerous state and federal agencies in collaboration to ensure the safety of citizens of Alachua County ,” she said.
Some of those precautions include setting 
up a driver’s license checkpoint on 37th Street from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. near the church for northbound traffic and having an increased police presence at the church and at the foot-
ball game.
The university posted a message on its 
website Wednesday evening assuring stu-
dents and parents that there have been no threats against the university.
Steve McClain, a spokesman for the Univer -
sity Athletic Association, reiterated the univer -
sity’s message and said the university’s plans for heightened security have not changed.
As for students attending Saturday’s game 
against the University of South Florida Bulls, he said students should try to arrive to the gates early , pay attention to their surroundings and report any suspicious activity.
As psychology sophomore Allie McDaniel 
stood in line to pick up her ticket to the game Thursday just before the ticket office’s closing, she was somewhat worried but resilient.
“I’m not going to let this crazy guy ruin my 
good time.”
Dogs cast DC mayoral vote by munching on treats
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Washington Humane Soci-
ety is conducting a "paw poll" to let dogs cast their votes for 
D.C. mayor. 
The poll was conducted Thursday morning at a dog park 
in northwest Washington.
Bone-shaped biscuits marked with each of the two lead-
ing Democrats' names were placed in front of the dogs, and they cast their vote by choosing which one to eat.
Spokeswoman Sabrina Fang says some owners didn't 
agree with their dogs' choice, and some dogs voted more than once because they were hungry.

UF has reached a settlement 
with shooting victim Kofi Adu-
Brempong, but details of the deal remain confidential. 
Adu-Brempong, who was shot 
by UPD officers on March 2, has agreed not to sue UF. 
In exchange, the university 
will pay his medical bills, will 
allow him to finish his doctoral program and will pay Adu-Brem-
pong an undisclosed monetary settlement. 
Janine Sikes, spokeswoman for 
the university, said the monetary 
details of the settle-
ment would not be released because of federal and state 
privacy laws. 
The money for the settlement will not come from state or uni-versity funds. 
The university will instead 
pay the settlement from alumni-donation funds. 
“Mr. Adu-Brempong is satis-
fied with the resolution,” Sikes said. “This was a tragic situation, 
and we wish Mr. Adu-Brempong a full recovery and success in his 
academic endeavors.”
“His goal is to recover from 
his injuries and complete his doc-toral dissertation,” Bill Hoppe, 
Adu-Brempong’s attorney, said. 
“This settlement will afford him both the time and the means to accomplish those goals.” UF to pay shooting victim with alumni donationsBREAKING NEWS

OF DUTY: MODERN WARFARE 2.”
By JOSH ISOM
Alligator Contributing Writer
Armed with video games and informa-
tion, military officials took over the Reitz 
Union North Lawn Thursday to recruit college students to their cause.
About 70 students came to the Interac-
tive Game Experience, an event sponsored by the National Guard that uses popular video games to spark interest in the Na-tional Guard and the UF Army ROTC. 
Steve Casto, tour manager for the Inter -
active Game Experience, said the event has traveled to every major college in Florida looking for college students. Using video games, he said, is a great way to bring stu-
dents together and to interact with them.
“If they want to make the military a ca-
reer, we’re there for them,” he said.
Students were asked to take a fact-
finding survey of yes-or-no questions that will help the National Guard decide which 
campuses are interested in the military. This information, Casto said, will be used for future recruitment programs.Some, such as Mike Sipos, a 19-year-old 
zoology major at UF, said the event caused 
them to pay more attention to the National 
Guard.
Others, like Ryan Swafford, a 19-year-
old political science  major at UF, don’t 
agree with using military-based games to 
recruit college students.
“It misguides people on 
what happens in wars,” Swaf-
ford said.
A total of 17 games were available, in-
cluding “Madden NFL ‘11,” “Super Smash Bros. Brawl” and “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.”The main draw of the event were two 
“Modern Warfare 2” tournaments in which 
32 people participated to win a backpack 
full of National Guard goods and a $10 gift card to GameStop.
“Modern Warfare 2” is a first-person 
shooter game that pits soldiers against ter -
rorists in a fictionalized war. 
Casto said the reason that “Modern 
Warfare 2” was chosen for the event and for tournament play is because it’s the 
most popular game out.
“If ‘Super Smash Bros. Brawl’ had been 
the most popular, it would’ve been chosen 
instead,” he said.National Guard uses video games to recruit at Reitz

Luke Jones, a pastor at the Dove World Outreach Center and the son of 
senior pastor Terry Jones, poses for a photo outside the church.
SON OF A  
PREACHER MANLuke Jones follows his father’s footsteps
By EMILY FUGGETTA
Alligator Staff Writer
Pastor Luke Jones clenches and unclenches his 
left fist as he sings, “Come. Now is the time 
to worship.” His right hand dangles next to a 
loaded .40-caliber semi-automatic pistol.
A month ago, the gun wasn’t there. A month 
ago, no one had threatened his life.
Luke, 29, is the son of Terry Jones, senior pas-
tor at the Dove World Outreach Center. It sits on 
a quiet 20 acres in northwest Gainesville amid de-velopments whose residents stop and stare at the church from the edge of the property and shake their heads, squinting in the sun. This week, just over a month since the church announced plans to burn copies of the Quran on Sept. 11, interna-tional media carpet the property , crowding against 
locked doors with tinted windows. Luke, along 
with the church’s other pastors, deflects reporters begging for interviews with his father. But a month ago, the property was silent except for the voices of those who worship within the church’s walls. 
Psalm 33:3: “Sing to him a new song; 
play skillfully, and shout for joy.”
On Wednesdays and Sundays, Luke sits in the 
front row of a mostly empty sanctuary. About 25 others sing with him for the first half of the service, including the 11-piece praise band performing on a stage. “Vision 100” is painted on the wall above 
them, signifying the number of members they 
hope someday will fill out the worship hall and join them on their mission to save the world from the evils of sin.
To say Luke sings along is to grossly understate 
his proud, confident voice, which carries to the back of the vacuous hall and cuts a path through the amplified sounds from the stage and the voices of his fellow worshippers. There is an authority to 
the sound. 
Jack, his young son, peeks over the seat behind 
him, smiling sheepishly at those who catch his eye.  
Like his father, Jack will grow up in a church where children scrawl phrases like “Islam is of the devil” and “Homo leads to hell” in the inside of worn Bi-bles, and little girls tell anyone who will listen that peace signs are evil, broken crosses that stand for something they can’t quite remember.Luke 2:40 “And the child grew and        
became strong in spirit.”
Luke compares his story to that of many pas-
tors’ children — in his early teens, he experimented with drugs and alcohol. But when he was 17, he began to attribute his depression and anger to the absence of a true connection with God.
“I was hungry for life,” he said. “I thought, 
‘God, if you really exist, I want to experience you. I want to make my own decision independent from my parents. I want to know that you’re true and real.’ And that’s what happened.”
Though not without moments of doubt, he be-
gan to conform to the beliefs of his father — that the Bible is to be understood literally, that homo-sexuality and belief in other religions are a ticket to 
hell, and that it is the responsibility of the church’s 
members to ensure that Islam doesn’t eclipse Christianity. When parts of sermons speak to him, he nods his head and lifts a hand in agreement.
“Yep,” he says. “Yep. Amen.”Luke was born and raised in Germany , but the 
Jones family moved to the U.S. three years ago after breaking with their church in Cologne, Germany. Now, an American flag tattoo is gradually being shaded onto his left forearm. A few days ago, the flag was a only crisp outline in red, white and blue. 
Now, a bright blue cuff of stars circles his wrist. 
The vibrant ink stands out against his pale arm the way his strong words contrast his lilting German accent. American Christians, he says, have become weak. They don’t follow the teachings of Christ the way they should.
James 2:18 “Show me your faith 
without deeds, and I will show you 
my faith by what I do.”
Luke and his father say the decision to go ahead 
with the burning of the Quran is contingent upon a mosque planned near ground zero — if the mosque is canceled or moved, or if the building’s planners agree to discuss it, the burn will be postponed or 
canceled. But if the Dove World Outreach Center 
is unable to influence the plans for the mosque, the burn may proceed. Until then, the world will hold its breath in disgust and awe, waiting to see if the pleas of millions will be ignored by a handful of members at a tiny church with giant ideas.By LIDIA DINKOVA
Alligator Contributing Writer
When Pastor Terry Jones announced Thursday he 
would suspend the Quran burning, journalists who came 
to Gainesville from around the country became uncertain about their plans for the next two days. 
After the announcement, anchors, reporters and pho-
tographers remained outside the church waiting to see what would happen next. 
“We are grateful, but it’s still touchy because of so 
many issues,” said Debbie Huntting, an NBC freelancer who is based in Orlando. “I think there will be a long time 
before this issue is resolved. I am still holding on and 
staying.”
Steve Berrios from First Coast News in Jacksonville 
said the TV station also plans to remain in Gainesville at 
least through Saturday, despite the suspension.
Other reporters awaited orders from their headquar -
ters on how to proceed. 
Videographer Matt James from WJXT, a TV station 
in Jacksonville, said the station’s crew of six would also most likely remain through Saturday. 
“We always have to be ready because he gives like 
a five minute warning before he comes out and talks,” 
James said of Jones. 
Chief photographer for Agence France-Presse, Paul 
Richards, said he expects a Quran-burning cancellation. 
“I don’t know the guy [and I haven’t] studied any of 
his stuff, but I am guessing he will go right up to the elev-enth hour and have a vision and decide not to do it,” Rich-
ards said. 
Despite the media circus, residents of the neighbor -
hood across from the church were still going through 
their daily routines.  
As they pulled into their driveways after work, some 
expressed concern about all the media attention Jones is getting.
“The man has a congregation of 50, and they are giv-
ing him the attention that Billy Graham wouldn’t get,” said Kathleen Stipek, a librarian at the Gainesville Public Library.
Her next-door neighbor Michelle Rucks said she is 
considering spending the weekend somewhere else be-
cause she is frightened for her safety and the safety of her 
8-year-old daughter.  
“I can’t even walk my daughter down the street be-cause she asks me questions about some of the signs he has put up,” she said. “Something’s wrong with them.”
As reporters struggled to meet their deadlines, they 
remained outside the Dove World Outreach Center on 
Thursday night waiting for events to unfold — whether 
they be Jones’ next speech or further orders from their headquarters.FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Today’s question: Do you feel safe in Gainesville this weekend?

Hateful messages have 
right to free speech
Gen. Petraeus said it may endanger troops if the burn oc-
curs. Hillary Clinton called their planned inferno dis-
graceful. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg 
called the international fiasco distasteful. Gov. Charlie Crist 
called it offensive.
Even President Obama has weighed in on Gainesville’s de-
scent to international embarrassment, calling the Dove World Outreach Center’s now-suspended plan to burn hundreds of Qurans Sept. 11 a stunt and contrary to American values. 
Whatever you want to call it, we’re sure you have your own 
opinions. 
And as much as we regret having to devote even more space 
to the blight of our city and deprive all of you of Darts and Lau-
rels until next Friday, we feel obligated to weigh in on the situ-
ation. 
We’re mortified that our city of Gainesville — where we have 
proudly elected a gay mayor and embraced Islam On Campus; 
where we have a university defined by understanding and wel-coming UF students — has drawn international backlash for a 
few dozen woefully misguided religious fanatics. 
The fact that our city has been transformed into a media 
frenzy where the Dove World Outreach Center keeps chum-ming the waters with their zealous, ignorant war cries is not 
only an embarrassment, but rather a permanent scar on our city 
where perceptions will inevitably become fact. 
Now that the international community has seen a hand-
ful of uneducated, closed-minded attention whores preaching exactly the opposite of what we believe to be Christian values, 
Gainesville will forever have an image of being intolerant and 
unwelcoming to those who are different whether this group chooses to go through with its plans or not.
We’re ashamed that students feel the need to flee the city 
Saturday in fear violence will ensue. We’re perplexed as to how anyone, even the handful of members of this “church,” no mat-
ter how distastefully uneducated and ill-advised they might be, 
can align themselves with such distorted versions of the loving messages of Jesus Christ. 
We’re proud to see so many students and community mem-
bers standing up for the rights of those who are different than 
them, especially on a somber day like Sept. 11.
Because that’s the true American spirit. Although the Editorial Board strongly believes The Dove 
World Outreach Center is quickly contradicting its own mes-
sage of peace, we also agree with New York City Mayor Michael 
Bloomberg’s statements that the “church” has a right to speak 
as it wishes. 
As Americans, and as ones who cherish the right to free 
speech and freedom of the press, we cannot consciously advise these zealots and inaccurate portrayals of both Christianity and 
our city to quiet down. 
We must remember that however much we disagree with 
the scab of Gainesville we just want to flick away from our bod-
ies, and however much we are disgusted by their incessant non-
sense, they have just as much right to free speech as those who 
are protesting their protest. 
But we also know freedom of speech does not govern what 
should be said.
What should be said is exactly the opposite of what our city 
might still turn into Saturday. What should be done is open-ing our arms to diversity instead of burning books in a crime 
against humanity . 
We can only hope the world will forgive our city for those 
who unfortunately choose to exercise their right to free speech 
in such a hateful way . Facebook full of facades and lies
While drunkenly watching “Closer,” I vaguely 
remember Natalie Portman saying, “Lying is the most fun a girl can have without taking her 
clothes off, but it’s better if you do.” And it made me think: Could I pull off a pink wig?
After drinking a few glasses of wine and sadly realizing 
pink hair and olive skin was a horrible idea, I thought back to that scene with Portman.
Was she right? Do people enjoy lying? But, most im-
portantly, would it be more enjoyable if clothing was re-moved?
So to answer my question, I did what any other college 
student does — I procrastinated by logging into Facebook first.
I found myself face-creeping through people’s pictures, 
notes, statuses and relationships. Now before we get ahead of ourselves, let me just say I wasn’t creeping to be a creep. I was creeping because I cared and because I had a column to write.
My Facebook journey taught me that of my 500 friends 
two are pregnant, 18 are attending the Neon Liger Dance Party, one had his Facebook hijacked so his status read “I like penis,”one’s cat had jumped into a toilet, three were 
coming into town for the University of South Florida game, 
five were already complaining about school and all of them were liars.
Maybe I was taking Facebook too seriously or maybe I 
was onto something, but either way I had an epiphany.
When it comes to social networking, we all lie.Our pictures, bios and statuses are all used to accessorize 
our cyber facade.
Sure, some of my friends came across as alcoholics and 
some came across like prostitutes and, yes, some actually are. But others appeared to be such happy individuals that they had neither worries nor problems.
I couldn’t help but wonder: Is it normal to be this happy, 
or am I a pessimist for thinking this world isn’t as happy as it seems?
So I found the person that 
seemed the happiest on my news-feed and just asked: Why are you always so happy?
Before this person got a chance 
to answer, I assumed his response would be inner peace or a pet uni-
corn. His answer, however, was a 
simple one.
Antidepressants.He was obviously lying (I think), but he did admit to one 
interesting tidbit.
People on Facebook don’t want to hear you talk about 
your mediocre day. So people embellish their emotions. We all do it.
The smiles become bigger, the jokes funnier, the slutti-
ness sluttier. We become who we think people want us to be.
People lie about their age, others Photoshop their imper -
fections, some create profiles just to stalk an ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend. Facebook is where people go to lie.
My final testament was my own Facebook. My most re-
cent status reads, “I hate getting accidentally drunk,” which is seriously a lie. I drink to get drunk just like any other col-lege student, and my Facebook is filled with embarrassing 
pictures to prove it.
So if it wasn’t for Rhianna and Eminem, we wouldn’t 
even know it was acceptable to love the way we lie, and we 
all do at one point or another.
Keeping that in mind, I decided it’s probably best to dye 
my hair pink and join the local strip club. As Portman said, lying is the most fun I can have without taking my clothes off, but it’s better if I get paid while doing so.

letters@alligator.orgWEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 7
I am saddened that Pastor Terry Jones of Dove World Out-
reach Center is leading an outrageous act of burning Qurans on Sept. 11. I am saddened that this may result in harm to 
Americans worldwide as Gen. David Petraeus stated Monday .  Ultimately, I am saddened that Jesus is being misrepresented 
to millions while news outlets across the world continue to 
pounce on this story as it unfolds.
Jones said recently on “Hardball with Chris Matthews” 
that in response to radical Islam, “our message to reach these people must be radical. And we feel that this message will be received as it is intended, as a warning.” This puzzles me because the very action that Jones is condemning is the same action he is taking by burning the Quran. It seems clear to ev-eryone but Jones and his followers that this is an act of hatred and violence.  Richard Hays, the dean of Duke Divinity School, makes an alarm-ing observation comparing Jones’ book burning to the Nazi regime when they 
held a book burning ceremony of their own in 1933. There they 
burned more than 20,000 Jewish books. We are all aware of 
what came after.
Jones claims his followers are, instead, like the first century 
Christians who brought their scrolls of witchcraft to burn fol-lowing their conversion. The conflicting issue with this associa-tion is that those new converts brought their own books to burn as a symbol of their repentance. They were not burning others’ books, as Jones is doing, in order to radically communicate a political message and send a warning.  I believe that as Christians we do have a radical message, 
and we are called to communicate that in a radical way.  We dif-fer from Jones, though, in both our message and our method.  
John, a disciple of Jesus, wrote that Jesus is the fullness of 
grace and truth.  When we only live by truth, we burn Qurans as hate-filled extremists.  When we only live by grace, we hud-dle together as ashamed inclusivists. When we live in the ten-sion of both, we unapologetically engage our world with their 
need for the forgiveness of sin while finding common ground 
in our need for that same forgiveness.
Mr. Jones, you want to be radical?  Don’t burn Qurans.  Fol-
low Jesus by loving your enemies and praying for those who persecute you.

Florida is just five games into its season 
and has already faced top-tier teams like 
No. 7 Nebraska, No. 11 Iowa State and No. 15 Colorado State.
And the season is about to get a little 
harder for the No. 4 Gators (5-0).
Gainesville will be the center of attention 
— for reasons other than religious demon-strations and football — this weekend when No. 1 Penn State (6-0), No. 2 Stanford (5-0) 
and No. 5 Texas (5-1) come play in the Nike 
Volleyball Big Four Classic.
“All eyes in the volleyball world are 
on Gainesville,” coach Mary Wise said. “Obviously each weekend that we play is a big deal to our players. The difference is that they hear it from relatives, friends 
and former high school club coaches and 
teammates. Everyone in 
the country who knows 
college volleyball knows 
about this tournament.” 
One thing that will not 
be hard for the Gators is 
finding extra incentive in knocking off yet another 
ranked opponent this ear -
ly in the season.
When the Gators take on the Nittany Li-
ons inside the O’Connell Center tonight at 7:30, they will face a squad that is the three-time defending NCAA champion and has 
won 108 straight matches.
The 99th match in that streak came last 
year against Florida in the NCAA Tourna-ment. Penn State won 3-0 (25-12, 25-18, 25-21), ending the Gators’ season.
“There’s always that competitive part of 
any athlete that’s going to want to get the team back that took them out of the whole thing,” senior Lauren Bledsoe said. 
Stanford booted the Gators from the 
2008 postseason while Texas did the same 
in 2007. “That’s some of it, but then the rest 
of it is just wanting to get out there and win like always,” Bledsoe said.

Reading the following section will 
earn you as much money as you’re 
willing to “loan” to Las Vegas. That’s a promise. 
While watching college football 
this weekend, you may feel the urge to gamble real-people money, as op-posed to that funny money seen at the “How Counterfeiting Works” section of howstuffworks.com. If that’s the case, reading ESPN’s Chad Millman 
or subscribing to betting-advice web-

But, really, you’re wasting your 
time.
Instructions are simple: look at 
who made the worst picks last week-end, see who they like this weekend, and pencil in the other team.  
Throw down serious money and 
you’ll have enough cash to buy a game-worn Independence Bowl jer -
sey. Be conservative, and you’ll at least be able to afford a Chris Mullin jersey to fit in with all the other Hoopsters at 
the next indie-rock festival.

Week by week, the margin for error is 
shrinking.
A mountain of mistakes — eight fumbles, 
bad snaps, a largely inept offense — weren’t 
enough to cost the Gators in their season-opener against Miami (Ohio), but they know that kind of performance won’t fly when 
they host South Florida on Saturday at 12:21 
p.m.
As embarrassing as last week’s game was, 
it did bring one positive: Florida learned ex-
actly what not to do.
“We didn’t want it to happen that way, 
but I believe it’s a blessing in disguise,” UF running backs coach Stan Drayton said. “It really woke our players up. We had a nice sense of urgency going into this week pre-
paring for South Florida, and I expect to see 
a better performance out of everybody.”
That shouldn’t be a tough threshold to 
cross, as UF posted just 25 yards through 
three quarters and trailed 3-0 at the end of 
the first quarter.
Meanwhile, the Bulls looked much more 
in sync, gaining 563 yards in a 59-14 rout of 
Stony Brook.
Quarterback B.J. Daniels was the engi-
neer of that outburst. He completed 15 of 22 
passes for 264 yards with two touchdowns and ran for another score. He’ll be the main 
focus of the Gators’ defense, and he drew comparisons to dual-threat quarterbacks Seneca Wallace and Michael Vick this week.
“He’s almost like Vick back there,” UF 
cornerback Jeremy Brown said. “He can move really good. He’s very versatile and can [bootleg] both ways, where most quar -
terbacks usually boot to the strong side. He’s talented, and we’re going to have to some-how keep him in the pocket.”
Defensive line coach Dan McCarney said 
his linemen have to strike the delicate bal-ance between getting a solid pass rush and over-pursuing, which would give Daniels open running lanes.
While the Bulls may not have the roster-

Chiang should know better than anyone that Da U won’t

This is an awkward position for me, but I’m taking Ohio 
State in this one. 
Unlike Mike, who would take ECU even if it were favored 
by 36 points against Alabama, I will use my head on this one.  
Miami just hasn’t shown me the consistency over the past 
couple of seasons to convince me that this is really its year.  
Mike, on the other hand, is taking the Hurricanes 
just because his favorite song, “The Seventh Floor Crew,” is rapped by a couple of their former players.  
Think with your head, man — not your heart.  
Just for this, you should change your lame-ass column name of “McCallin’ It Like I See It,” to “McCallin’ It Like I Feel It.”

Now, on to the picks!
In first place with a record of 6-3 is Alligator Assistant Sports Editor Tyler “OMG Look at your status!” Jett, who, 
despite recently becoming legally allowed to drink, spends his nights in the office waiting for people to leave their Fa-cebook pages unattended so he can paste passages from his 
slam page in their profiles like a middle-school girl. Burn! 
Leading the huge second-place orgy with a 5-4 record 
is the Gainesville Sun’s Edward “My heaven is filled with 
supermodels and rum-and-cokes” Aschoff, who ended a 
rare deep religious discussion among sportswriters with the 
above statement. Ed, at the rate you’re going, you’ll be lucky to get Roseanne Barr and a Four Loko.
Planted squarely in the 5-4 scrum is the Miami Herald’s 
Joe “Is ‘True Blood’ new this week?” Goodman, who swears 
he only watches Vampire shows because its where the chicks 
are at. That’s respectable, but you crossed the line when you bought those “Twilight: Breaking Dawn” movie tickets more than a year in advance and  bathed in a tub of milk and Count 
Chocula. 
Also at 5-4 is Alligator football writer Kyle “Chiddy Bang 
is the best EVER!” Maistri, who had a brief panic attack this 
week when he left his iPod in the office. If he doesn’t meet his quota of three hours of Chiddy Bang per day, he gets real 
ornery.
Next at 5-4 is Alligator football writer Mike “It’s not that 
hard, just slip her some roofies” McCall, whose post-gradu-
ation plans include (a) working at Books-A-Million (b) mov-
ing to Atlanta and (c) entrenching himself into a rich family 
by impregnating their daughter.
Squarely at the bottom of the 5-4 pile is Gatorbait.net’s 
Keith “We used to stack [expletives] like you five feet high in Korea” Niebuhr, who has been polishing his rifle and practic-
ing Clint Eastwood’s “Get off my lawn” speech from “Gran 
Torino” in case the Alligator crew parks in his grass before the game Saturday.
In seventh place with a 3-6 record is Alligator Sports Edi-
tor Anthony “Although I’m not against it, we’re NOT reunit-ing” Chiang, who disappointed all his fans when someone 
hacked his Facebook and promised his friends the Bone 
Thugs Bosses were getting back together.  Search “DJ Khaled I’m So Hood BTB” on YouTube and you will understand ev-eryone’s excitement. 
And in dead-ass last place with a piss-poor record of 2-7 is 
FightinGators.com’s Cody “Only three weeks until fall base-ball starts!” Jones, whose palms get sweaty as he lies in bed at night, dreaming about new Florida pitcher Karsten Whitson and what it would be like to shake his hand.FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 15
Holtz brings new look to USF
wide talent of some of the other teams on the 
Gators’ schedule, Florida coaches and play-ers agree that the teams will be close in terms of speed.
“This is an SEC-caliber team we are play-
ing,” UF coach Urban Meyer said.
That’s debatable, but actual Southeastern 
Conference opponents are on the way. 
USF is the last non-conference foe before 
the Gators open their conference slate, and a trip to No. 1 Alabama looms on Oct. 2, mean-ing Florida doesn’t have much time to get its ducks in a row.
And the Bulls would be all too happy to 
play the spoiler.
Coach Skip Holtz has brought a new at-
titude to the program after replacing Jim 
Leavitt, who was fired amidst the fallout 
from accusations that he struck a player in the locker room.
Holtz set about lightening the mood right 
away, stopping a fall practice to take the 
team swimming and organizing an Olympic 
Games for his players — even winning the free-throw shooting contest.
Fresh off turning East Carolina’s losing 
program into a back-to-back Conference USA 
champion, Holtz’s track record is a cause for concern. In 2008, he led the Pirates past Virginia Tech and West Virginia to start the season, and UF coaches had to dig deep to study the ten-dencies of him and his staff.
“When we turn on South Florida film, 
we’re looking at athletically what they’re ca-pable of doing,” Drayton said. “From a sche-matic standpoint, we have to go back and study those coaches, and we may be looking at other teams.”FOOT , from page 14  AC  TJ  KM  MM

Gators and the Nittany Lions will 
take on the Stanford-Texas winner, with the losers of both games play-
ing each other as well.
Florida will play Saturday at 
4:30 p.m. regardless of today’s out-
come.
The Gators, who received a 
first-place vote in the rankings this week, will face their hardest test so far this season when they take on the Nittany Lions for the seventh 
time under Wise (3-3).“Asking 18- to 22-year-olds 
to be perfect is kind of a stretch, 
but volleyball is a game based on 
mistakes,” Wise said. “There isn’t 
a whole lot of room because there are not a lot of weaknesses on these teams.”Gators receive first-place vote

One week is all the Gators will get.
After finding a way to stink it up in a 22-point 
win to open the season, Florida will be granted a 
mulligan from its fans — but only one.
But you should know one thing: This isn’t something 
new.
Under Urban Meyer, the Gators are 5-0 in their open-
ers, but that’s only because they have played some ter -
rible teams.
If the first game is omitted from those five seasons, you 
have a better indication of how flat UF comes out of train-
ing camp.
In 2008, the year Florida won the championship, Mey-
er’s team began with a game in which it committed 13 penalties and could only muster 151 passing yards against Hawaii. It also fumbled once.
The next game of that season, the Gators only scored 
nine points through three quarters until they broke loose for 17 in the fourth against Miami.
Two games after the grind-it-out battle against the 
Hurricanes, UF lost to Ole Miss in The Swamp.
In 2006, another national championship year, Florida 
quarterbacks began the season with a combined three in-terceptions against the likes of Southern Mississippi and Central Florida. 
Now, this isn’t an excuse for Florida’s poor offensive 
performance against a team that won just one game last season, but it is something to pay attention to.The next question is, why is this 
becoming a trend?
If you look at all of the early sea-
son struggles, they all sprout from the offense.
This is because the spread is heav-
ily based on timing. With an offense 
that works out of the shotgun and 
uses option plays, jump passes and wildcat packages to keep defenses off balance, it takes game experience 
to perfect it and get it right.
It’s no coincidence (no, it wasn’t Tim Tebow’s speech 
after  the game that did it) that UF’s offense followed its 2008 loss to Ole Miss by averaging 52 points per game in the last eight contests against teams such as FSU, LSU and 
Georgia before winning the national championship to end 
the year.
Last Saturday’s performance was merely just a contin-
uation of Florida’s poor early season play. 
Let’s break down the mistakes the Gators made against 
the RedHawks.
Mike Pouncey’s inability to snap the ball is the first 
thing that stands out. I doubt that happens again. 
We aren’t talking about some freshman or sophomore 
making his first start at center. Pouncey is a senior who is part of the watch list for the Rimington Trophy. He will get it fixed.The second thing on the stat sheet that stares back at 
you is the eight fumbles.
That should never happen on a rainy day, let alone a 
nice one like this past Saturday.
Some of those fumbles were derived from the botched 
snaps. If those get fixed, the number of fumbles will al-ready be on its way down. 
The third thing that was alarming from the win against 
the RedHawks was the play of the running backs. 
Jeff Demps ran for 102 yards, but 72 of those came on 
one run. Meanwhile, Emmanuel Moody gained just 16 yards on five carries against a defense the Gators were 
supposed to gash.
This is a concern. But when 17 passes are completed 
for an average of about six yards, that really doesn’t help 
stretch the defense and help open up the run.
Moody struggled in the season opener, but five carries 
weren’t enough to get going. 
He is the type of back who will get stronger with work 
because of his bruising style. 
All of these things are correctable. 
If Florida focuses on fixing these fundamental mis-
takes, they shouldn’t carry over.
Now, if UF is in its eighth game of the season and 
botching snaps, then it’s time to worry.
For now , let’s cut the Gators a little slack for their poor 
play to start the year.
Why shouldn’t we? We have for the past five seasons.Gators’ early season struggles shouldn’t be a surprise to fans

Florida safety Ahmad Black returned a second-quarter interception 40 yards last Saturday, setting the 
Gators up for their thrid touchdown. He said he is watching more ﬁ  lm this year than in the past.
  By TYLER JETT
 Alligator Staff Writer
tjett@alligator.org
   
 The centerpiece of Florida’s 
defense has been downsized by 
about 60 pounds and half a foot.
  Senior safety Ahmad Black 
doesn’t intimidate like former 
linebacker Brandon Spikes did. 
There are no videos of the 5-foot-
9, 190-pound Black standing over Georgia running backs, dread-locks waving like “The Preda-tor.”
  But size and hair aside, Black 
has not shied away from assum-ing Spikes’ old role as the heart-beat of the Gators’ defense.
  “He brings leadership, juice,” 
cornerback Janoris Jenkins said. 
“He keeps everybody going.
  “When it’s time to make a big 
play, he’ll make it,” he added.
  With the offense struggling 
early in last week’s season open-
er against Miami (Ohio), Black 
told his defensive teammates that 
they needed to stay focused, that the offense needed to be bailed out. 
The unit did just that, most 
notably through Jenkins’ 67-yard interception return to give the Gators a 7-3 lead.
  And, two drives later, Black 
turned a slight Florida lead into a comfortable one, picking off a pass at the 43-yard line and weaving through the offense be-fore getting tackled steps short of the end zone.
Black’s interceptions set up the 
Gators’ third score of the game, giving them a 21-9 lead on just 13 yards. 
  “We have to make something happen,” he said after the game. “We have to step up and, usually, that motivates the offense to play better.
“We knew we had to cause 
turnovers.”
  Led by Black’s career-high 12 
tackles, the Florida defense held Miami to just 212 total yards and forced four interceptions. 
  Black said he is watching ﬁ  lm 
more than he ever has in the past, and his knowledge of last week’s opponent gave him more conﬁ  -dence. 
He predicted what the Red-
Hawks were running several times, which allowed him to run full speed, something he said he hasn’t always felt comfortable doing. 
  He is also better at breaking 
on routes and reacting to tipped passes, which led to his second-quarter interception.
  But even playing at a slower 
rate, Black impressed defensive coordinator Teryl Austin with his ability to swarm all over the ﬁ  eld. 
Watching game tapes when he 
ﬁ  rst came to Gainesville, Austin noticed that while Black wasn’t big or particularly fast, he was always sticking his helmet where 
the ball was.
  “I said, ‘Who’s that little guy 
running around?’” Austin said. 
“But that little guy is a good player. 
“Sometimes there are small 
guys who play small, but he’s not. He’s a small guy who plays big, and that’s important.”  Undersized Black 
justiﬁ  es leadership 
role with success

South Florida Bulls Florida Gators
Coach: Skip Holtz
Players to watch:  QB B.J. Daniels, WR Evan Landi, DT Terrell 
McClain, OLB DeDe LattimorePrognosis: South Florida will bring a young team to The Swamp on Saturday. The inexperience doesn’t stop there. 
Holtz became the head coach at USF in the offseason and has 
been at the helm for just one game. The defense returns just ﬁ  ve starters and lost six of its top seven tacklers from last sea-son. This should allow Florida to put some points on the board.
Offensively, USF quarterback B.J. Daniels, who ran for 1,029 yards and threw for
another 1,983 last season, will pose problems for the Gators’ defense. His ability to runand create plays with his feet should make for an interesting chess match between Danielsand UF’s front seven.Coach: Urban MeyerPlayers to watch: QB John Brantley, RB Jeff Demps, CB Janoris Jenkins, OLB A.J. JonesPrognosis : Florida is coming off a disappointing 34-12 
win against Miami (Ohio) in its season opener. The Gators fumbled eight times and led by just nine points early in thefourth quarter. But the lackluster performance seems 
to have served as a wake-up call for UF.  Center Mike 
Pouncey, who botched several snaps last Saturday, has met up with Brantley this week to 
ﬁ  x the mistake. Also, with such a young USF defense, Brantley should put up big numbers this week. But the Gators will need some help from their running game. Last week, UF had just 16 rushing yards on 21 carries through three quarters. 
Florida’s defense was strong against the RedHawks. The unit intercepted four
passes and made plays throughout the game. It will face a stiff test in B.J. Daniels thisweek, but the speed of UF’s front seven should contain the dual-threat quarterback.
