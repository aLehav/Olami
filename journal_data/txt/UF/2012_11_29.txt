�THE RESTAURANT WILL 
OPEN IN THE SPRING.

When a Red Robin Gourmet 
Burgers commercial comes on TV, 
Rebecca Kingston gets upset.
“It’s such a tease,” the 20-year-
old sociology junior said.
Since she moved to UF, she 
hasn’t been able to go to the burg-er restaurant because there were none in town. But that’s about to change.
Red Robin will open its ﬁ  rst 
Gainesville location in The Oaks Mall in spring, said Angie McCa-nn, general manager of The Oaks Mall.
The chain has locations through-
out Florida from Miami to Tampa.
The restaurant’s ﬁ  rst location 
opened in Seattle in 1969. There are about 470 restaurants across the U.S. and Canada.
Red Robin’s burgers range from 
about $8 to $11. Other meals such as bowls of soup and sandwiches range from about $5 to $14.
Kingston said she used to eat 
her favorite burger, the Bleu Rib-bon, with macaroni and cheese on the side at Red Robin’s location in Fort Myers once every two weeks.
“I’m excited for the new loca-
tion, since I won’t have to drive four hours to get my ﬁ  x,” Kingston said.
The new Red Robin location 
will have an outside entrance be-tween Ruby Tuesday and Coldwa-ter Creek on the north side of The Oaks Mall.
McCann said the leasing com-
pany the mall works with scopes out restaurants and stores they think will do well there, and then they begin negotiations to bring Red Robin to open 
location in Oaks Mall

Pedro Bravo pled not guilty Tuesday to 
ﬁ  ve additional charges in his alleged connec-
tion to Christian Aguilar’s murder.
On Nov . 15, a grand jury brought charges 
against Bravo including lying to police, pro-viding false reports, mishandling human re-mains, tampering with physical evidence, and poisoning food and/or water with the intent to kill or injure a person.
A jury previously indicted Bravo on charg-
es of kidnapping and homicide, which he also pled not guilty to, according to Alligator ar-chives.
During Tuesday’s hearing, the State At-
torney’s Ofﬁ  ce collected saliva samples from Bravo and later collected handwriting samples from him at the Alachua County Jail.
Judge Mark Moseley discussed deposi-
tion schedules with witnesses before the next case management hearing, scheduled for Jan. 22.
A representative from 
the State Attorney’s Ofﬁ  ce said the prosecution had “about 100 witnesses avail-
able” to give testimonies.
On Wednesday , Alan 
Chipperﬁ  eld, Bravo’s de-
fense attorney , said the witnesses are usually people who have knowledge of the case.As the case moves forward, the defense 
will review the prosecution’s evidence and in-terviews with witnesses.
“We are allowed to take deposition from 
certain witnesses who are designated as im-portant,” Chipperﬁ  eld said.
Bravo has remained in custody at the Ala-
chua County Jail since he was arrested Sept. 24, four days after Aguilar, 18, went missing.

Patrons at a southwest Gainesville 
hotel evacuated for about two hours 
Wednesday afternoon after main-tenance workers found something suspicious inside a room.At about 3 p.m. Wednesday , 
Gainesville Police Department re-ceived a call from employees at the Paramount Plaza Hotel & Suites, at 2900 SW 13th St., who said they stumbled upon what they thought was a meth lab, said GPD spokes-man Ben Tobias.A Gainesville Fire Rescue Hazmat 
team and the Alachua County Sher-iff’s Ofﬁ  ce bomb disposal team were called to the hotel to assist GPD of-ﬁ  cers in the investigation.
The threat turned out to be a false 
alarm, and the device in the room was a plastic cup ﬁ  lled with colloidal silver, a liquid made of microscopic silver particles used as alternative medicine.
During the investigation, the 
room guest told investigators the liquid in the cup was his medicine, Tobias said.
At about 5 p.m., police allowed 
guests and employees to return to the hotel.
Tobias said police would not 
charge the man with any crimes and stressed that although the situation may have been inconvenient for the guests, safety was the priority.
“We’d rather pull out all the stops 
and take all the necessary safety pre-cautions and have it be a false alarm rather than not take all the precau-tions and have people get hurt,” he said.

Red Robin will open its 12th Florida location at The Oaks Mall in spring 2013. The 
restaurant will be between Ruby Tuesday and Coldwater Creek.
Employees are usually hired about 
five weeks before the opening
them to The Oaks Mall.
Jamie Winter, communications manager 
for Red Robin, said in an email interview 
that the restaurant has a great relationship with the owner of The Oaks Mall, General Growth Properties.
When there was an opening at the mall, 
she said, Red Robin was sought out as a good fit.
Nora Jones, a 19-year-old anthropology 
sophomore, said she has only been to The Oaks Mall a couple of times in the year she’s lived in Gainesville, but she’s interested in going there to try Red Robin in the spring.
“I’ve heard they have good food,” she said. “My brother went to one in Tennessee, and he has been talking about going back ever since.”
Winter said employees are usually hired 
about five weeks before opening.
“We are very excited about coming into 
Gainesville, and we think it will be a perfect fit for our family-friendly restaurant,” she said. “And who doesn’t love a burger and fries?”ROBIN , from page 1

C.J. Shaw has always been seen as 
the kid among the retirees.
But with nine years of experience in 
barbershop-style singing, age is only a 
number for Shaw. The 25-year-old may look out of place when he practices sing-ing with some men old enough to be his dad, but his voice fits right in with the a capella harmony.
“Age doesn’t have anything to do 
with barbershop,” Shaw said at the Gainesville Barbergators’ open house event last month. “It’s how well you sing with your quartet.”
Shaw, a Santa Fe College music 
freshman, is one of the 35 members of the Gainesville Barbergators, the local chapter of the Barbershop Harmony Society, an all-male international orga-nization that practices a capella singing.
Shaw began singing when he joined 
a concert choir in elementary school. He later became part of The Heart of Florida Barbershop Chorus and the One Voice Chorus, and he has competed in-ternationally.
“I was the chorus geek of middle 
school and high school,” he said.
He heard about the Gainesville 
chapter from a friend after he moved to Gainesville about six months ago.
“The first day I sang with these guys, 
I never wanted to leave them again,” Shaw said.
The Gainesville Barbergators also 
includes four official quartets that per -
form locally and compete against other chapters. The quartets meet weekly to practice and are usually formed by the members themselves, said Dick Moyer, president of the Gainesville Barberga-tors.
Barbershop-quartet singing consists 
of four parts including tenor, lead, bass and baritone, Moyer said.
“Your voices make the instruments,” 
he said.
He normally sings the lead part.“I don’t feel out-of-sync with these 
guys,” Shaw said. “I feel like we are a big family of singers.”
Shaw said his favorite experience 
with the Gainesville Barbergators was when they visited a nursing home and performed in orange jackets and blue ties. “I just sang my heart out like we do here in the rehearsals,” he said.
Moyer said he most enjoys the social 
aspect of being a member. 
“There’s a very interesting collection 
of guys,” he said. “There’s all walks of life here.”
UF alumnus Dave Jacobs has been 
the musical director of Gainesville Bar -
bergators for about six years. “My best friends are the people I sing with,” he said. “Guys from this chorus sang at my wedding.”
Jacobs first joined the Barbergators in 
1984, when he was a sophomore at UF.
He said he mostly enjoys Valentine’s 
Day, when his quartet sings to sweet-hearts upon request.
Shaw said he hopes to one day fol-
lows in Jacobs’ footsteps and become a music director. “I want to stand in front of people and direct and interpret music to fellow men,” he said.
He plans to stay involved in Barber -
gators as long as he lives in Gainesville. “Until the day that I can’t sing, I’m go-ing to keep paying my dues to stay as a ‘barbershopper,’” Shaw said.Gainesville group just needs

PARTICIPATED AT UF.
CARINA SEAGRAVE

Christina Montana has slept a total of nine 
hours in the past four days, but finals aren’t 
to blame.
Montana, 20, spent the past month with 
her laptop and the occasional bag of chocolate Twizzlers writing a total of 50,000 words — about 175 pages — for National Novel Writ-ing Month, which happens every November.
“I told my roommates not to let me do 
it this year, but I was waiting for my Italian class to start, and I saw a guy staring at a girl and wondered if he actually liked her without knowing her,” said the UF junior majoring in English and specializing in creative writing. “That was my inspiration.”
Montana’s novel is about a man named 
Chase who made eye contact with a woman in a bookstore, felt a connection and returned every day in hopes of seeing her again.
She completed her novel late Tuesday, 
making it the third consecutive year she has won NaNoWriMo.
“The best part about doing it in the middle 
of all my schoolwork is thinking, ‘Aw, college isn’t so bad, college isn’t so rough because I just finished a novel in 30 days,’” she said.
Each area that participates in the event has a municipal liaison who hosts write-ins, which allows participants to come together for encouragement and support amid writing challenges, Montana said.
UF assistant librarian and former co-mu-
nicipal liaison for NaNoWriMo Stacey Ewing said 25 to 50 writers participated in the UF-sponsored write-ins last year.
This year, Gainesville had no liaison, but 
students and community members found a way to participate through the local NaNoW -
riMo Facebook page. People attended write-ins at Coffee Culture, Ewing said.
Write-ins were also held by the Alachua 
County Library, said Alachua County eBranch librarian Gail Carr. The library group met each Tuesday this month at the downtown Alach-ua branch.
“We all chatted just a bit at the beginning 
and during a couple of breaks, but mostly we just pounded away on our laptops while still enjoying being in the company of other writ-ers,” Carr said, adding that she hopes for a better turnout next year.
In order to stay on top of her word count 
on her own this year, Montana wrote 10,000-word installments, which she called “cush-ions.” That discipline helped her finish the novel early , but other writers are still dealing with the 11:59:59 p.m. Friday deadline.
But even though she completed a novel, 
Montana’s work was not done.
Her reward for finishing, she said, was 
starting an essay.National Novel Writing Month

Communicate with 
your government 
There’s a “ﬁ  scal cliff,” you guys, and somehow that cliff is looming.
The “ﬁ  scal cliff” is an important ﬁ  nancial decision that 
lawmakers have to work together on in order to stop America from heading into ﬁ  nancial ruin. What’s the big deal?
“Without some kind of agreement on the expiring tax breaks 
and expected spending cuts, the Congressional Budget Ofﬁ  ce has predicted the United States would plunge back into a reces-sion at the start of 2013,” said an article on Politico’s website. “But if the situation looks dire — with a ﬁ  scal cliff at its worst totaling $665 billion, or more than 4 percent of the economy — the pullback can start immediately.”
What Obama seems to realize is that it’s going to take some 
push from the American people in order to get anything done.
Uh, but the ﬂ  ipside of that is the realization that American 
people can be extremely hard to motivate to do anything. Most people will only do something if it’s very easy to access and takes very little effort.
We’re pretty sure Obama understands that about us.On Wednesday, he released a new kind of grassroots cam-
paign: a Twitter hashtag.
“Middle-class families, folks who are working hard to get 
into the middle class, they’re watching what we do right now. If there’s one thing that I’ve learned, when the American peo-ple speak loudly enough, lo and behold, Congress listens,” the president told a crowd of middle-class Americans at the White House on Wednesday, according to ABC News.
A $2,000 tax increase is part of what will happen to the Amer-
ican middle class if an agreement is not reached.
“It’s $2,200 out of people’s pockets. That means less money 
for buying groceries, less money for ﬁ  lling prescriptions, less money for buying diapers,” Obama said in an ABC News re-port. “It means a tougher choice between paying the rent and paying tuition. And middle-class families just can’t afford that right now.”
So he, or his brilliant team, came up with a Twitter hashtag 
for folks to use in order to encourage their lawmakers on Twitter to do something and reach an agreement: “#My2K.” Remember Y2K, when we all thought computers would freak out and shut down the world in the year 2000?
They’re equating that potential meltdown to the ﬁ  nancial 
mess we all will face if an agreement is not made by the end of the year.
The president wants to stress the importance of reaching out 
to your lawmakers, and it’s not a bad thing to remind us about.
We might forget sometimes that really important people in 
our legislature are literally an email or phone call away. Heck, you can even write on their Facebook walls. It seems much eas-ier to tell people how you feel before they make a decision that could affect your livelihood.Remember the reason for the holiday season 
This is my favorite time of year. Despite the nipping coldness that grabs any visible skin, there is more happiness in the air.
Maybe it is because students only have to go to class for 
less than half the month of December or the lights strung along strip malls add a bit of cheer to otherwise mundane days. Christmas songs are blared through all public spaces, and there is all-around better food as people gather togeth-er to celebrate family.  
To me, this is Christmas.It is a time to make memories that will be remembered 
for decades and also the opportunity to keep old traditions alive. There is a decorated Christmas tree in my house and a heap of presents thanks to Black Friday sales. With only 26 days left until Christmas, Santa is making his ﬁ  nal naughty and nice tallies.
If we were to pass each another on the street, I would 
happily wish you a “Merry Christmas.”
However, in a world that is constantly changing, it may 
no longer be politically correct to say.
If I knew your religion celebrated a different holiday, 
I would say “Happy Hanukkah,” “Happy Kwanzaa” and so forth.
But I won’t wish you a “Happy Holidays.”Each religious celebration is unique, and each deserves 
the common courtesy of calling it by name.
Why be scared of offending others?Simply wish them a “Happy whatever-you-celebrate,” 
and let them respond with their own holiday of choice. By doing this, we share a piece of ourselves with others, and they offer back the same.  
It’s incredible to think people are constantly so con-
cerned about their personal appearance. For some, cars, clothes, homes and every detail of their lives need to be perfectly in line and then displayed on Facebook for all to see. But when it comes to religious holidays, people are perfectly content being clumped all together and sent a single “Season’s Greetings.”
People want to be treated as 
individuals and be able to prac-tice their rights. But then, why is it OK for others to get upset when they do this?
It comes down to respect.But the retail market, which 
claims to be getting even more personal with its customers, may 
not recognize the speciﬁ  c holidays people celebrate. Few stores and companies take the time to acknowledge the separate holidays that, together, make up the season they so fondly advertise.
Not all stores take part in this nonsense. Target has an 
entire Christmas section proudly displayed in each store, and on macys.com, shoppers can purchase a “Jesus is the Reason” sign.
Christmas is not about being politically correct. It is a 
religious celebration of the birth of Jesus and has evolved into a season-long celebration focused on spreading peace and joy. But modern-day Americans have stripped it of this meaning. Presents and celebrations are all part of the Christmas season but are not the main focus as society makes it seem.
Without Christ, there is no “Christ”mas.Elves, reindeer and Frosty all have their place through-
out the madness. But society needs to recognize the holi-days’ deeper meanings that people have shied away from.
According to Urban Dictionary, the word combining 
Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa doesn’t leave anyone feeling left out. Now there’s never a need for “Happy Holi-days.”
May I be the ﬁ  rst to wish you a very merry “Christma-
hanakwanzika.”

It started with four co-founders, a 
full email inbox and one garage. 
David Argov , Alexza Morales, 
Heather O’Rourke and Aly Perez, UF 
advertising seniors, started Garage Agency & Co., an advertising agency , from Argov’s garage.
“Every business has humble begin-
nings. They start at a dorm, a room in a house or in a garage,” said Argov , the company’s “account dude.”
Garage Agency & Co., which of-
ficially launched last August, focuses on small- and medium-sized local busi-nesses and student-run organizations. It also does digital work for businesses outside Gainesville, Argov said. The startup currently serves about 11 cli-ents.
Clients include local restaurant 
Tasty Buddha, UF’s Ad Society and Squeezed, a website that informs peo-ple about healthy juicing lifestyles. The company also does work for Peaceful Paths, including creating business cards for people overcoming domestic abuse.
The company’s “strategy ninja,” 
Morales, said the four decided to start the agency when Argov and O’Rourke approached Morales, who felt ready to handle her own business after several advertising internships, and Perez, who saw a need for local advertising.Argov said he felt prepared to start 
the business after bagging an internship with the CementBloc, a multichannel creative agency in New York City, and working as an account director for Ad-Werks, UF’s Ad Society’s student-run advertising agency.
Before starting the business, the 
founders met with William J. Rossi, a UF professor of entrepreneurship and associate director for GatorNest.
“He gave us the best advice that we 
could have possibly gotten,” Argov said. “He basically said, ‘Just go, and do it.’”
So they did it.After better understanding the logis-
tics — taxes, costs and competition — the group met about once a week dur -
ing the summer to create the company from scratch, he said.
Argov said Garage Agency & Co. is a 
first in Gainesville, which he said lacked an agency for creative advertising. The startup is also a “valued alternative” to existing advertising agencies.
“It’s all about understanding what 
the client wants and understanding the target audience,” said O’Rourke, the agency’s “marketing wiz.” “Tie that in with an eye for design, and you’ve got Garage.” 
Garage Agency & Co.’s owners are 
part of a growing trend of college stu-dents who create companies, Rossi said.
More students are interested in start-
ing businesses, and more students who start businesses are successful at it, he said.
Rossi said the number of students 
in his Introduction to Entrepreneurship course increased, and about 30 percent of the students aren’t business majors.
Startup Hour, a monthly event in 
Gainesville that brings student and graduate entrepreneurs together, in-creased from about 50 to about 150 at-tendees since it began in 2010, he said.
This trend is fueled by the Internet, 
which makes creating a company easier, faster and cheaper, as well as by the lack of traditional jobs, Rossi said.
“Students who have an interest in 
starting a business have less to lose to-day,” he said.
Jordan Meyer, director of com-
munications and marketing for the Gainesville Area Chamber of Com-merce, said the growing number of student entrepreneurs contribute to the amount and success of local businesses.
Argov said he isn’t worried about the 
profit or the future of Garage Agency & Co. The agency is an opportunity to test his skills and challenge himself before he enters the workforce, he said.
“You need to do something to get 
real-life experiences,” he said. “Your curriculum just isn’t enough anymore.”

Missed a few Christmas gifts on Black Friday? 
You still have a chance to get the perfect gift.
The GLAM Indie Craft Show will open for the 
holiday season from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday.
About 70 vendors will offer locally made, unique 
items perfect for holiday gifts at the event.
“The vendors are what really make GLAM 
unique,” said GLAM Producer Kim Kruse. “We 
have a unique assortment of people who are hand-picked because they all make one-of-a-kind items that are really and truly unusual and great for gift-ing.”
Kruse ensures the items her vendors offer cater 
to a wide variety of interests and prices.
“You can find anything from gifts for family 
members to more ironic gifts for friends,” she said.
Vendors range from DeTiki Custom Carvings, 
which will offer carved wooden purses and Christ-mas ornaments, to Luellabird, which will sell up-cycled jewelry made from vintage neckties and scarves.
“I take old-fashioned button jewelry and upcycle 
it to make it relevant to modern day fashions,” said Luellabird owner Nancy McLamore, adding that she is excited to see the show because every year the producers outdo themselves.
This year, the craft show has a new location in 
the Historic Mustang Hangar, 4701 NE 40th Ter -
race. Aside from providing additional space for more vendors and more customers, the site pro-vides what Kruse labeled a “cool, industrial, chic vibe.”
“The hangar definitely fits the theme of the show. 
It’s unique, it’s local, and it also gives it a family-friendly vibe,” said co-owner of t.w.i.n.k. Beauty Karen Welk, who will bring a full line of all-natural cosmetics and beauty products to the sale.
Many vendors took note of customers’ demands 
for more manly gifts and are coming prepared this year. Gifts range from bar cases to cosmetic “man-kits” from DeTiki and t.w.i.n.k. to “Star Wars”-themed knit beer coozies from Knit at the Bar.
Other notable gifts for sale include cookie mixes, 
original nail decals and knitted circle scarves.
Celebrations Catering will sell food and drinks 
as well as beer and wine to keep the expected crowd of holiday shoppers going.
“I love coming to Gainesville because it always 
brings a mellow crowd who truly understand the art,” said DeTiki owner Sarah Tanner. 
Admission to the show costs $3 for adults and 
is free for children 10 years old and younger. For more information and a list of vendors, visit www.glamcraftshow.com.Vendors craft for

Reading a monologue can save 
lives.
And on this particular stage, ac-
tresses aren’t required to have expe-
rience — just a heart to end violence against women and girls.
From 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Dec. 9 and 
6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Dec. 11, self-identi-ﬁ  ed women in Gainesville can au-dition at Rush & Glassman, 11 SE Second Ave., for “The Vagina Mono-logues.” 
It’s an annual beneﬁ  t production 
through V-Day, which is a global activist movement to end violence against women and girls. Beneﬁ  ts will go to Peaceful Paths, a domestic abuse network that serves survivors of domestic violence in Alachua, Bradford and Union counties.
“It’s a phenomenal healing 
event,” said 27-year-old Keri John-son, a third-year religion and nature graduate student and director of the 
local production.
As a survivor, 
she said she is excit-ed to put together the production, and she is hoping for as many actresses as possible.
“I want to have everyone in-
volved who wants to be involved,” Johnson said.

Canadian indie-rock duo 
Japandroids will play at 9 p.m. tonight at High Dive. The band will be joined by support act Swearin’.
This show marks one of 
the band’s ﬁ  rst live appear-ances in Florida, following its shows in Orlando Nov. 28 and Tampa Nov. 29. Ja-pandroids is composed of guitarist/vocalist Brian King and drummer/vocalist Dave Prowse.
“We’re pretty excited,” Prowse said. “It’s rare for us now to have much uncharted territory within North Amer-ica. Most towns we’ve played very often. Florida is exactly the opposite corner of North America from where we are in Canada. It’s just one of the places that’s a little harder for us to get to. But it’s deﬁ  nitely been somewhere we’ve been looking forward to play for a while.”
Prowse said Japandroids 
received emails from fans asking to play in Florida.
The band is touring in 
support of its latest album, “Celebration Rock.” The al-bum was released in June.
Tickets for the Japandroids 
show are available on www.ticketweb.com. Tickets cost $13 in advance and $15 at the door. There is a $2 younger-than-21 charge upon entry.

� THE LINE, PIERRE LOUIS, IS 
SOLD AT WOLFGANG.
BETTINA LOONEY
Avenue Contributing Writer
Speed and agility are required on 
the field and off it.
Wondy Pierre Louis, a Hai-
tian native and former UF football 
player, found a new passion and launched a luxurious fashion collec-tion called Pierre Louis.
The history of the brand goes 
back to the 1970s, when Pierre Lou-is’ family handcrafted clothing in the Caribbean. 
This inspired him to develop a 
unique brand that represented his family’s former traditions.
Pierre Louis grew up surround-
ed by the clothing business, which helped him generate new ideas to launch his business. He played foot-ball for years and decided this was the next step he wanted to take.
“I enjoy what I do because I get to 
constantly meet a lot of people and it’s extremely social,” Pierre Louis said. “The best part about it is being able to carry on my family’s legacy.”The logo took two years to create. 
The signature icon is a palm tree, bent as if it is being blown away . The brand is also recognized for its 
cursive, over -
lapping P and L, Pierre Louis 
said.
P h i l i p 
Spottswood, Pierre Louis’ agent, said six of their friends came together a 
few years ago to discuss a possible company logo.   “Palm trees reminded Wondy of 
his home back in Haiti, so we decid-ed that this would be an appropriate logo,” Spottswood said.
101 Cantina, a local sports bar, 
saw this as an opportunity to help a former Gators football player and wanted to spread his ambition and dream. Pierre Louis made limited, custom-made gameday tank tops with the traditional P and L logo for Cantina, which cost $25.
“It’s crazy how it started off so 
small, and now we are selling over 100 shirts each gameday at Can-tina,” Spottswood said.The Pierre Louis brand represents 
more than clothing, Spottswood said. It expresses the importance of tradition, culture and how it relates to the different audiences the com-pany targets.
“It’s catchy , it’s fashionable, it’s 
trendy , and it sounds like something you would want to wear. It’s Pierre Louis,” Spottswood said.
The Pierre Louis clothing line is 
available at Wolfgang, a local bou-tique, at 1127 W. University Ave.
“Next step: opening an of-
ficial Pierre Louis store here in Gainesville,” Pierre Louis said.

you like to get some Mediocre Advice? Visit http://mediocreadvicegators.tumblr.com/ask
Ariel Barnes
Dear Friend,
Why follow a trend? You should do what you feel com-
fortable doing to your body because you’re the one dealing with it every day. I don’t think there is a trend anymore. Now, everyone has her own preference. Some girls like to keep a Rapunzel braid in their knickers, and some girls like the bare look. Your friends and the sexpert you follow are wrong, but the guy you’re hooking up with is right. Being a 10-year-old girl is what makes one look like a 10-year-old girl, not shaving your private parts. Throwing out your razor doesn’t make you any more of a classy adult woman. The amount of hair one keeps down there does not have to reflect your age or status. Do whatever is easiest and best for you. What I do to my lady land is classified, but I don’t let others influence the choices I make down there and you shouldn’t either. Dear Friend,
I think threesomes are unnecessary and pointless. I’m greedy, and I hate shar-ing, so I don’t understand why anyone would want to share someone in bed. No, you cannot have the other half of my sandwich, and no, you cannot have the bottom part of the man under my sheets. I can’t believe there has ever been a threesome that wasn’t horribly awkward at some point. It’s too much work for too little reward. You have to set rules with the people involved, and most of the trouble is finding someone who is willing to do it. The only reason this ridiculous-ness is a craze is because people love to say they did something adventurous. Threesomes are like skydiving. There is no point to jump out of a plane unless you’re going to tell everyone and make the photo of yourself 2,000 feet above ground close to crapping yourself your profile picture. The day I jump out of a plane is the day I’m on an aircraft that is about to explode — and that’s more likely to happen to me than a threesome.Dear Mediocre Advice,
What are your feelings on three-
somes?
Dear Friend,
I agree. Relationships are overrated because most people just don’t want to be lonely. People need to learn how to be alone before they can be with someone else. Lack of commitment is not only within our culture, it is a widespread pandemic. I think it has to do with the fact that everyone is turning into bigger a--holes, but I may be wrong. Relationships should be under-rated. One should give less of a s--t about a potential romance unless it knocks his or her socks off.  Freedom and variety, which sounds like a recipe for a one-night stand, are great, but those things are worth drop-ping when someone better comes around. People should stop wasting so much time on a--holes or those who are only around because being lonesome is worse. Find the 
people that matter.Dear Mediocre Advice,
Relationships are overrated, and I think our culture is progressively adopting lost interest in committing to one an-other. I don’t know about you, but I like freedom and variety. Agree or disagree, 
but please substantiate your claim.Dear Mediocre Advice,
I started shaving my hoo-hoo in high school because my lady friends all said I should. I thought this was the norm, but today a blogger and self-proclaimed sexpert I follow wrote that classy adult women don’t shave. To make matters more confusing, now a lot of my female friends say they don’t shave because they don’t like to look like 10-year-olds, and the guy I’m hooking up with says it’s unnecessary. When did the 
trend change? What do I do? What do you do?
Dear Mediocre Advice,
This guy I talk to told me that he likes me, 
but when we are alone, he never makes a move. It’s annoying. What do I do?
Dear Friend,
Why are you waiting for him to make the move? I’m sure you’re sick of holding hands by now. The next time you two are alone, don’t wait — just go in and kiss him. There are many reasons guys won’t make the first move: 1. He may not be that kind of guy. (Trust me, they exist.) 2. He isn’t completely sure you reciprocate his feelings and doesn’t want to get rejected. 3. His strict Catholic parents taught him that kissing and fornication are sins. For your sake, I hope it’s not No. 3. But whenever you think the time is right, you should do something. Show a little chutzpah!Look out for Mediocre Advice in

Georgetown game will not resume
Florida and Georgetown will not play the second half of their suspended 
season opener because the two sides could not agree on a date, a Georgetown spokesperson told ESPN on Wednesday.Tymrak up for national award
Florida senior Erika Tymrak is one of 15 semiﬁ  nalists for the 2012 Missouri Athletic Club’s Hermann Trophy, which is given to the NCAA’s top soccer player.    Sugar never tasted so bitter-
sweet.
  No. 5 Florida is all but as-
sured an appearance in its ninth Sugar Bowl, as two key decisions by coach Will Muschamp returned a broken program to national title contention.
  Muschamp, his 10 assistants and 
countless others involved behind the scenes deserve much of the credit. 
  The players earned the victories, 
but the coaches made a difference as the Gators walked a ﬁ  ne line be-tween jubilation and heartbreak.
  Florida’s success is largely due 
to Muschamp picking Jeff Driskel to quarterback a mundane offense built around the running game.
  UF entered the year with ques-
tions surrounding every offensive position. No quandary was more polarizing than who would take the snaps under center. Throughout the offseason, nobody mentioned one quarterback without talking about the other. 
  Muschamp caught ﬂ  ack for start-ing both of them a g a i n s t Bowling  Green in the season opener.
  Hav-
ing two 
starting quarterbacks wasn’t going to work for a team searching for an identity.
  The coaching staff recognized 
which player gave UF the best chance to win. With an unproven of-fensive line, a mobile Driskel made the most sense.
    Muschamp knew the Gators 
weren’t the sexiest team in America. He just wanted wins.
  Naming Driskel the starter estab-
lished Florida’s M.O. as a physical football team.
  Although the Gators turned into 
America’s most boring offense mid-way through the season, Muschamp   LANDON WATNICK
 Alligator Writer
 
  For the Gators, this season’s 
ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve games have been a cake-
walk.
  Florida defeated all ﬁ  ve of its 
opponents by an average margin of 23.8 points and is second in the country in scoring defense, allow-ing only 48.4 points per game. 
The Gators smothered then-
No. 22 Wisconsin, outmuscled Middle Tennessee and outhus-tled UCF. 
  “Either we’re just playing at a 
high level right now, or I guess other teams haven’t been able to match our intensity and energy,” junior center Patric Young said. “We haven’t had to face much adversity in the games that we’ve played.”
  No. 7 Florida could see its 
ﬁ  rst true test tonight at 9 when it squares off against Marquette (5-1) in the O’Connell Center for a rematch of last year’s Sweet 16. 
  The contest kicks off a dif-
ﬁ  cult three-game stretch for UF that features road games against Florida State on Dec. 5 and No. 9 Arizona on Dec. 15.
  “We’re getting a chance to ﬁ  nd 
out a lot more about ourselves,” coach Billy Donovan said. “Clearly, as it relates to maybe most schools across the country, I think ours has got to be one of the more challenging non-conference schedules.” 
  In last year’s NCAA Tourna-
ment, the Gators defeated the Golden Eagles 68-58 to advance to the Elite Eight. 
  In 2011-12, then-seniors 
Darius Johnson-Odom and Jae Crowder scored 46.9 percent of Marquette’s points as the Golden Eagles ﬁ  nished second in the Big East.
  UF also lost two key players 
since last season. Starting point guard Erving Walker graduated, and guard Brad Beal bolted for the NBA Draft and was selected No. 3 overall by the Washington Wizards.
  “Both of us have new faces on 
our teams,” senior guard Ken-ny Boynton said. “They’ve lost their two primary scorers, but now they’re more of a balanced team.”
  Added Donovan: “Their team 
kind of went as Crowder and [Johnson-Odom] went, and those other guys ﬁ  lled in. … They real-ly have the potential to be better than they were a year ago.”
  Marquette’s only loss this sea-
son was a 72-71 defeat to Butler at the Maui Invitational, when guard Rotnei Clarke shocked the Golden Eagles with a despera-tion three-point heave that beat the buzzer. 
  Florida and Marquette are 
both deep and balanced.
Six Golden Eagles average at 
least seven points per game. 
  Juniors and leading scorers Davante Gardner, Vander Blue and Jamil Wilson are Marquette’s top talents. 
  Four of the Gators’ ﬁ  ve start-
ers average double-ﬁ  gure points. 
With junior point guard Scot-
tie Wilbekin (suspension) and junior forward Casey Prather (multiple concussions) back in the mix, UF’s rotation is 11 play-ers deep. 
  “It’s going to be anybody’s 
night for our team,” Young said. “That’s how balanced I think we are. Scottie’s coming off the bench, knocking down a lot of shots. You’ve got Casey, who can affect the game with his ath-leticism and his energy. If line-ups switch up however they do, guys off the bench are going to be ready to step in and just pick up the slack.”

 Gators to be tested after easy start
  PHILLIP HEILMAN
 Alligator Writer 
 
  The Gators have struggled 
from three-point range this 
season. But, much to the cha-grin of coach Amanda Butler, that hasn’t stopped them from trying. 
  Through seven games, 
Florida is 33 of 130 (25.4 per-cent) from three-point range,  attempting nearly 19 shots per game. Aside from Carlie Needles, who has made 19 of her 47 attempts, the Gators are shooting 16.9 percent. 
  “We’ve got to be a little 
bit more judicious and have a little bit more discernment in our shot selection,” Butler said. “If you’re settling for a three, then you’ve got to look at that a little bit closer and make a good decision.”
  Butler has a simple ﬁ  x: get 
the ball inside more often.
  In Florida’s 74-58 loss to Arizona State on Sunday, the Sun Devils outscored the Gators 50-24 in the paint. 
  UF made just 1 of 9 three-
point attempts, which contin-ued a trend that has bothered Butler this season. 
  “Sydney (Moss) is the per-
fect example,” Butler said. “She is really hard to guard in the paint. She’s really hard to guard off the dribble. But you’re not as hard to guard behind the three-point line.” 
  Senior Jennifer George 
plays the largest role in en-suring the offense runs as the coaching staff hopes.Florida  struggling

13.5 points per game and is the focal point

“I need to step up,” George said. “I set 
the tone. I need to take more pride in my offense and defense down low.” 
Needles, the only bright spot for Flori-
da’s three-point shooting this season, said Butler urged the Gators to understand that open shots are not necessarily good 
shots. 
“You have to 
find the people that have been making shots,” Needles said. 
“People have been playing zone to keep the ball away from Jennifer, but we need to work and stay key to what makes us successful.”stuck to his guns, which is deci-
sion No. 2.
Offensive coordinator Brent 
Pease arrived after six years at Boise State. Last year, he ran a balanced offense with a dy-namic passing game.
Florida has 259 pass attempts 
and 509 rushes this season. 
UF’s offense is ranked No. 
104 nationally , the worst for a top-five team since at least 1999 — as far back as the NCAA website lists total offense rank-ings. The last time a top-five team was even close was  in 2003, when No. 4 Ohio State finished No. 93 in total offense.
But UF’s offensive formula 
never changed — run, run and run some more. 
Granted, running the ball 
may be the only thing the Gators can do on a consistent basis. 
But Muschamp never once 
tried to turn the offense into something it isn’t. UF is in good hands with Muschamp at the helm. He showed he can make decisions with conviction and follow through.
The second-year coach isn’t 
satisfied with a season marred by a “what if?”
“Complacency kills,” Mus-
champ said. “You can’t get complacent in what you’re try-ing to do.”
Forget about what could 
have been. 
With Muschamp leading the 
way, the best is yet to come.

Come December, Florida will be 
able to practice year-round.
The UF Athletic Association, 
with funding from alum Nancy 
Perry, built a new indoor tennis fa-cility.
Executive associate athletic di-
rector of internal affairs Chip How-ard said via email that UF built the Charles R. and Nancy V . Perry In-door Tennis Facility so the teams could practice through the rain.
Howard and Florida women’s 
coach Roland Thornqvist consid-ered the previous indoor facility subpar.
The courts were not regulation 
size, so no official matches could be played on them. 
Rain leaked onto the courts from 
the sides of the facility, negating its primary purpose.
“We hoped for a few years that 
we could take the old facility down because it wasn’t appropriate any-more,” Thornqvist said.
UF’s need for an indoor court was prominent because of frequent rain in Florida. Rain on hard courts like the ones at Alfred A. Ring Ten-nis Complex, where the Gators compete outdoors, presents safety issues.
“As soon as it starts raining 
on hard court, you have to stop,” Thornqvist said.
Men’s coach Bryan Shelton re-
lated playing on a wet hard court to driving on wet pavement — it gets slippery.
“You put on the brakes too hard, 
and all of a sudden you are sliding out and a little bit out of control,” Shelton said. “That’s what happens when you try to play when the courts get wet.”
With the new facility, the Gators 
can practice for indoor tournaments without driving to Gainesville’s other indoor courts. Also, Florida can now host indoor tournaments, Howard said.
Both coaches appreciate the ef-
forts of Howard, Nancy Perry and UAA.
“It’s just the commitment that 
this place has to doing things the right way,” Shelton said.UF builds indoor facilityTENNIS
