Jay Carney told an auditorium 
full of UF students how he took an 
unusual path to becoming the 29th White House press secretary Mon-day.
Unlike the 28 press secretaries 
before him who had come to the job with political experience under their belts, Carney said he began his ca-reer as a journalist.
During the event held in the Uni-versity Auditorium, Carney told stories of his background in journal-ism and his experiences as a former White House press secretary.
Carney began his journalism ca-
reer as a reporter for the Miami Her-ald, where he covered cops, county 
commissions, drug smuggling 
and environmental issues. He later found himself wanting something more, he said.
“I wanted to trade in the palm 
trees and the sunshine for the cold and the gray and the snow of Mos-cow in what was then the Soviet Union,” Carney said.
He spent three years covering 
the demise of the Soviet Union in Moscow for TIME Magazine before returning to the U.S. to cover politics in Washington.
Carney also mentioned his expe-
riences working for the Obama ad-ministration. He said working in the White House was the most reward-ing and challenging three and a half VOLUME 109 ISSUE 46 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG TUESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 2014

Students experiencing dif-
ﬁ  culty with XpressConnect 
and their Apple or Android 
devices should look no further 
than UF’s Computing Help Desk for assistance.
Apple and Android de-
vices are experiencing con-nectivity problems between device tools and auto con-ﬁ  gurations, preventing some students from accessing the  
WiFi. Some have connected 
the issues with the timing of the latest Apple updates.
Dan Miller, associate di-
rector of network services for UF Information Technol-
ogy, wrote in an email that 
it’s unclear which problems have been caused by speciﬁ  c device incompatibility or by 
issues within the new Apple 
software.
“It’s Apple’s new product, 
and, like with all new prod-ucts rolled out, there are some 
kinks,” he said.
UFIT is testing a new ver-
sion of the XpressConnect 
conﬁ  guration that may help 
the issues students are experi-
encing. Manual conﬁ  guration is also available for those who are seeking help.
“Manual conﬁ  guration of 
the new Apple operating sys-
tem is very straightforward 
and covered in online docu-mentation,” Miller said.
Apple users are not the 
only ones experiencing dif-ﬁ  culties. Android users have 
reported problems with con-
necting through XpressCon-nect, too.
Malique Pye, a 21-year-old 
UF art junior, has experienced problems with his Android phone’s Internet using Xpress-Connect.

UF Student Government was chosen for 
the ﬁ  rst time to host the annual Southeast-
ern Conference Exchange in July 2016.
The SEC Exchange weekend provides 
opportunities for SG executive boards to come together to discuss ideas to improve campus life, said Brandon Krumins, execu-tive secretary of communications for SG.
The 14 SEC schools voted during the 
last SEC Exchange at Auburn University to make UF the 2016 SEC Exchange loca-tion.
“It’s a chance for all the SEC schools to 
come together for a weekend to learn from each other and to improve their schools by collaborating with each other,” Krumins 
said.UF Student Body President Cory Yeffet 
said UF wanted to host the 2016 conference because the Reitz Union would be ﬁ  nished 
with construction.“We’re really excited to host a confer-
ence that will showcase our university to 
the other 13 SEC schools,” he said.
The conference will help generate ideas 
to make SG more efﬁ  cient and transparent, 
Yeffet said.
“I think that it will beneﬁ  t the Univer-
sity of Florida’s Student Government and allow us to improve our Student Govern-ment and connect with other schools,”  Yeffet said.UF Student Government chosen for SEC Exchange opportunity

Students looking to create the lat-
est popular app can visit the UF In-
formation Technology Open House on Thursday. 
The event for students interested 
in creating mobile apps will take place at 3:30 p.m. in the new Mobile App Development Environment (MADE@UF) located in Room 100 of the Marston Science Library.
MADE@UF is a collaboration 
between the George A. Smathers Libraries and UFIT to provide re-sources to students to facilitate mo-
bile app development and to create 
a community environment for peers, entrepreneurs and innovators, said Anne Allen, UFIT  assistant director of academic technology.
This “mobile sandbox for UF stu-
dents” has been three years in the making, said Allen, and is a space with software, hardware and neces-
sary resources for students to learn 
and start developing apps. 
Apps created by students at 
MADE@UF belong solely to the stu-dents who created them and will not be published by the university.
“The information session is to 
introduce students to the space, the hardware, software, local entrepre-neurs and the online training re-
source currently being developed,” 
Allen said.
The online training is not a course 
for credit, but it is a resource that will be available outside UF when it is completed in the form of a massive open online course, Allen said.
John Shea, an associate professor 
of electrical and computing engineer-
ing, is developing the online training 
for MADE@UF. He will be the first to speak on Thursday and plans to give a brief overview of the online course Mobile Application Development with Web Technologies.
Following the presentations, there 
will be time to talk with presenters and mingle with others interested in 
mobile app development.
Allen said MADE@UF will fi-
nally be able to show off what it has 
worked toward. 
“It took a long time, and there 
were several hurdles to navigate be-fore it became a reality, but we are extremely pleased with its growth and especially our collaboration with 
the libraries and Judy Russell, the 
dean,” Allen said.UFIT to host event for 
mobile app development years that he could imagine.
“The best thing that I found 
was being part of something 
bigger than yourself,” he said. 
“It’s being part of something you know matters and that you believe in.”
He compared working in 
the West Wing to standing in a hurricane or tornado.
Carney said his typical day 
at the White House included 
parking his car by the West 
Wing, waiting for somebody to tell him “he’s ready” and then getting in a helicopter with 
President Obama.
Jasmine Haddaway, an 18-
year-old UF international stud-
ies freshman, said she felt Car-ney made politics seem more relatable.
Melody Zargari, a 19-year-
old UF international business sophomore, also attended Car-ney’s speech. 
“I really appreciated that he 
encouraged a generation,” she said. “He said that we are the forefront of our country.”4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 2014

Wanted: flamingos for St. 
Pete’s oldest attraction 
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.— 
Sunken Gardens, the city’s oldest tourist attraction, is short of its 
biggest stars: pink flamingos.
The Tampa Bay Times reports 
that Sunken Gardens is down to 
George and Lucy, its last two fla-mingos.
Two Sunken Garden volun-teers started a nonprofit quest called Flamingos Forever about a year ago to replenish the flock. With $30,000 raised, it’s now about halfway to what’s needed 
to purchase 20 flamingos.
It’s best to acquire flamingos 
in groups of 20 or more, because 
they are most likely to mate when 
they feel the security of living 
in a large flock. For that reason, most breeders will only sell them in lots of at least 20.

will have naming rights of a new bird.Horse rescued; flamingos wantedLOcAL

The Friends of the Library book sale was 
bustling Monday.
Shoppers wandered through each aisle 
of the warehouse at 430 N. Main St., where 
about 500,000 donated items were housed 
just two days prior. Now, most of those 
items – ranging from books to CDs to comic books – have new homes.
“It’s the best recycling program we have 
in Gainesville,” said volunteer coordinator Liz Jones, 80.
Jones said there were more than 108,000 
items left as of Sunday, but had “no earthly idea” how many had been sold since it be-gan.
“We seem to be doing better than we had 
been in the spring,” she said.
Every shelf, rack and bin was loaded with 
donated books.
Lacey Rhea, 30, and her husband, Lo-
gan, 32, browsed children’s books with their 6-month-old baby, Lydia, in tow. While Lo-gan held Lydia, Lacey cradled a few John Lithgow books, with “Marsupial Sue” top-ping the pile.
“I pretty much only buy my books from 
this book sale,” she said. She said she and her husband might look for some books for themselves, but they were mainly buying for Lydia.
“Pretty much everything we do now is 
for this one,” Rhea said. “She took over.”
In the architecture section, Alex Rosen-
berg, 24, stood next to a growing pile of 
books, flipping through pictures of old 
buildings.
“When I was a kid, my brother lived in 
Gainesville, so I’ve been coming here for 15 years,” the UF business and philosophy senior said. “Me and my dad would fill up boxes, and my mom would yell at us.”
He said he couldn’t remember what kinds 
of books he wanted to buy when he was 10 – probably comic books and records.
This time, he said he fell in love with pic-
ture books.
His pile included a van Gogh art collec-
tion book, an architecture picture book and an anatomy textbook.
“For a dollar, you can learn everything 
that’s ever been learned about the human body,” said Rosenberg, who had been to the sale four times within two days and bought 20 books so far. “I’ll probably get 20 more.”Friends of the Library sees old, new visitors in 60th sale

◗ IT’S FUNDED BY THE AMERICAN LUNG 
ASSOCIATION.

UF is launching a weight-management pro-
gram for overweight children with asthma.  
The UF Childhood Health and Asthma Man-
agement Program (CHAMP) will provide strat-
egies for children and their parents to practice healthy behaviors beginning in January. The program, funded by the American Lung Asso-
ciation, will be of no cost to the to the families 
who participate.
David Fedele, an assistant professor in the 
department of clinical and health psychology at UF, said the program is in the design stage 
and is recruiting families to participate.
“CHAMP hopes to help the children’s 
weight management by changing their body 
mass index, lung function, asthma control and 
physical activity,” he said.
CHAMP will be partnering with Health-
Street, a local organization that links the medi-
cally underserved to medical treatment, social services and research opportunities. CHAMP is 
partnering up with the center for space. Health-
Street, 2401 SW Archer Road, offers free park-ing and is easily accessible, Fedele said.
Parents and children will meet for 16 weeks, 
where they will be placed in separate groups with interventionists who will monitor them.
Fedele said the children will participate in 
physical activities like relay races during each of their sessions.
“We want to integrate physical activity into 
their daily lives,” Fedele said. “The goal is to 
not make it something to avoid or be feared. If 
their asthma is well controlled, the kids should engage as they would without asthma.”
Program interventionists will use manuals 
to help guide them in teaching the parents and children about building a healthy lifestyle.
“The manuals take a very long time to 
write,” Fedele said. “They will act as a script for the interventionists, but they will be more 
of a guide.”
Kyra Frey, a 20-year-old UF biology junior, 
said the program will alleviate issues for kids 
with asthma so they can enjoy physical activity 
to the fullest.
“Growing up with asthma, I always felt lame 
because high-energy sports like basketball were 
really hard for me,” Frey said. “Combining that with a weight problem can leave a kid feeling 
incompetent.”
Mackenzie Corson, an 18-year-old UF in-
terior design freshman, also had issues when 
growing up with asthma.
“When I was younger, I would have to stop 
and catch my breath in a game when I would play sports,” Corson said. “This program will teach kids that they can get better and partici-pate in rigorous activities.”UF launches CHAMP program

Students with bad credit back-
grounds can still acquire financial 
aid following a federal ruling last week that updated the Federal Di-rect PLUS Loan Program.
The new regulations are intend-
ed to educate students about debt by implementing a loan counseling program and a more efficient appli-cation process for new borrowers, according to a federal release. The 
ruling was published in the Federal 
Register on Thursday and will go into effect July 1.
Sarah Sullivan, a 21-year-old 
UF political science senior, uses the federal loan program in conjunction with other subsidized and unsubsi-dized loans to pay for her studies.While Sullivan thinks that the pro-
posed amendments sound “politi-cal, idealistic, mostly noncommittal 
and unclear,” she is supportive of the measure.
Sullivan said the proposed 
changes are a step in the right direc-tion, but she said more needs to be done to minimize the degree of debt students are expected to undertake in order to pay for school.
“We need to have smart, capable 
and well-rounded individuals who are talented and dedicated enough for development and innovation 
across all fields of study — that’s how we prog-
ress,” she said.
Rick Wilder, 
director of UF stu-
dent financial af-
fairs, said as long as parents with bad credit have a cosigner and opt to go through 
loan counseling, students can still participate in the loan program.
This new loan counseling tool 
will assist all borrowers with cus-tomized information regarding their financial aid, he said, not just those with poor credit.
Wilder said he believes most UF 
students will not be affected by the changes, as most students’ parents have good credit. For those whose parents have bad credit, however, the new regulations will be helpful.
 “Any time there is an opportu-
nity to educate parents and students on borrowing money in a respon-sible way, it’s a good thing,” Wilder 
said.

At just 14 animals shy of being danger-
ously overcrowded, Alachua County Animal 
Services is nearing capacity.
The county facility currently houses about 
236 animals, said Vernon Sawyer, the shelter’s director.
“The more animals we have at the facility, the greater the danger of them becoming ill,” he said. “Dogs get kennel cough and cats get upper respiratory infections.”
According to state law, an animal must be 
held for three days if it does not have identifi-cation and five days if it does, Sawyer said.
“A lot of times individuals that come here 
just want to drop off their animals,” Sawyer said. “They don’t want to listen; they are just done. It’s kind of sad.”This month, Levy County Animal Services 
also faced overcrowding, euthanizing its first group of animals based on need since March.
Every day a list of local shelter animals at risk of euthanasia is sent to rescue groups, in-cluding the Alachua County Humane Society and Gainesville Pet Rescue.
ACHS executive director Amanda Burks 
said her organization receives about 15 ani-mals from Animal Services each week, with a goal of an average stay of 30 days or less for each animal. 
“The main barrier to assisting Animal Ser-
vices more is space,” Burks said. Raining cats and dogs — county shelter nearly over capacity

HAVANA — Cuba has 
allowed construction of the 
country’s first new Catholic church in 55 years, the church said Monday. Experts said it’s 
a sign of improving relations 
between the Vatican and Cu-ba’s Communist government.
The church, funded by do-
nations from Catholics in Tam-pa, will be built in Sandino, a citrus- and coffee-growing town in the far-western prov-ince of Pinar del Rio.
The church publication

who you’re voting for?Today’s question: Do you have a student loan?
Young people will largely avoid voting in next week’s 
midterm elections, and this should come as no sur-prise to anyone who follows elections closely. While 
young people did turn out in relatively large numbers in 2008 and 2012, the youth vote largely goes silent during 
midterm elections.
We hear the excuses time and time again. Voting doesn’t 
matter, both parties are corrupt, politics suck or politicians 
don’t share my views. Whatever the excuse may be, young people need to put down their smartphones and vote. You may think your vote doesn’t matter, but that attitude is ex-actly what’s allowed corrupt and thick-headed politicians to win ofﬁ  ce.
Whether you plan to vote next week or not, we can 
all agree that politics in the U.S. are a divisive mess, and whether it’s in Washington or Tallahassee, they are in desperate need of change. Regardless of your ideology or party afﬁ  liation, you owe it to yourself to be part of the process, rather than just another grumbling young person disillusioned with American politics.
Our state and country face enormous tasks that must 
be solved with leadership in politics. You may despise government and think politicians are Satan incarnate, but 
the fact remains that citizens willing to serve their state 
or country must solve society’s largest ills. When it seems that corruption and ineffectiveness has permeated every corner of public service, it’s our responsibility as citizens and voters to ﬁ  nd new and effective leadership.
If the Democrats and Republicans don’t do it for you, 
vote third party or write in a candidate. Sure, they’re guar-anteed to lose, but you can’t reform the system if you don’t let people know you’re dissatisﬁ  ed. If choosing the lesser 
of two evils won’t get the job done, choose someone else 
and let people know why.
It’s easy to make excuses, and surely young people will 
generate a host of reasons why they didn’t vote this year, and few — if any — will have merit. If you’re sick or have familial reasons why you can’t make it to the polls, then perhaps you have a valid excuse, but in a time where you can vote by mail or vote early, you certainly have time to vote. Voting is easy and relative-ly painless, and it matters more than you think.
In 2012, I worked on a cam-
paign that lost a runoff by a mere 
seventeen votes. Granted, this 
loss can and should be placed squarely on the shoulders of those running the campaign — myself included — but how 
many people decided that voting just didn’t matter and stayed home? I still believe my candidate was the better person for the job, and if that’s true, the impact of that election was enormous for the candidate’s community.
Honestly, it’s astounding how many Americans roll 
their eyes at elections and ignore their right to vote. How many countries in the world don’t have fair or open elec-tions? How many countries pretend to have democracies only to rig the election process and leave thousands or mil-lions of citizens without true democratic representation?
We complain about millions of dollars in corporate 
contributions controlling campaigns and lobbyists rigging the government in their favor, but we still have the oppor-
tunity to vote and choose our representation. It may seem 
like something reserved for a civics class, with a teacher pontiﬁ  cating about the importance of the right to vote, but perhaps that’s what we need.
You can ignore the polls on Tuesday and thumb your 
nose at the process, but as the old adage goes, if you don’t vote, you can’t complain. Fill your Facebook page with complaints about politicians and the government, but if you don’t vote, your words are largely empty, forever lost 
in a sea of cyberspace-based grievances.
Whether you vote for Charlie Crist, Rick Scott or Mick-
ey Mouse, vote for someone or something on Tuesday. 
Who knows, your vote may be the one that decides the future of your community, the state or even the country. So, do yourself a favor next week and vote.

Attorney General 
Bondi’s priorities
During her campaign for re-election, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi has trumpeted her tough-on-crime credentials. In particular, she has emphasized her suc-
cess in curbing Florida’s rampant “pill mill” and human traf-ﬁ  cking industries.
However, in recent months, Bondi has extended her focus far 
outside of Florida, signing her name to legal briefs in a number of other states. According to the Tampa Bay Times, Bondi has signed on to briefs challenging bans on certain semi-automatic weapons in Connecticut and New York.
One of the most bizarre legal challenges that Bondi supported 
was a federal ban on “straw purchasers” of guns. A straw pur-chase occurs when an individual purchases a gun on behalf of someone else who would otherwise be prevented from owning 
a ﬁ  rearm – often because of a criminal history or mental health 
condition.
Leaving aside the threat that straw purchases pose to public 
safety, a gun control law passed in Connecticut has little bearing on gun rights issues in Florida. Jonathan Lowy, director of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence’s Legal Action Project, succinctly questioned Bondi’s motives: “How can (Bondi) con-tend that the people of Florida are made more safe if there are more assault weapons in Connecticut?”
One explanation for Bondi’s support for these far-ﬂ  ung legal 
challenges is the support she has received from the Republican Attorneys General Association.
RAGA’s mission is to support the election of Republican at-
torneys general around the country. The Times reported that the group has donated $750,000 to Bondi’s re-election campaign. 
RAGA has received millions of dollars in donations from 
dark money political groups. More than 25 percent of RAGA’s funding comes from just four of these groups – the largest do-
nation came from the American Future Fund, an organization 
heavily supported by conservative mega-donors Charles and David Koch.
The result of this fundraising pipeline is that Bondi’s re-elec-
tion campaign is being funded, either directly or indirectly, by anonymous ultra-conservative donors around the country.
These dark money groups are not funding Bondi’s campaign 
out of a sense of altruism — they expect a return on their in-vestment. By lending her support and her reputation as attorney 
general to these legal challenges, Bondi is helping to advance 
conservative policies and jurisprudence throughout the entire country, regardless of its relevance to or impact on Florida.
Bondi seems primed to cruise to an easy re-election against 
underfunded Democratic challenger George Sheldon. A recent Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9/UF Bob Graham Center poll found Bondi with a commanding 10-point lead over Sheldon.
Unfortunately, if Bondi is re-elected, Floridians will have to 
endure four more years of an attorney general who is more in-terested in placating wealthy conservative donors than in serv-ing the people of the Sunshine State.TUESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 2014

opinions@alligator.org TUESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 2014  ALLIGATOR, 7
Last week, our nation experienced 
a horrible tragedy, the details of which were all too familiar.
Three people were killed and three 
are critically wounded after a student opened ﬁ  re in his high school cafeteria, eventually turning the weapon on him-self. At a time when students should have been enjoying lunch and ﬁ  nishing last-minute homework, they were sud-denly running for their lives.
The community of Marysville, Wash-
ington, will forever be changed by this horriﬁ  c event, and all Americans should be outraged because of it.
We should be outraged that more than 30,000 
people in the U.S. die each year from gun violence, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention.
We should be outraged that 87 incidents of gun-
related deaths or injuries occurred in schools since Sandy Hook.
We should be outraged that grocery stores, schools, 
college campuses, movie theaters and malls have all been places where innocent people were shot and killed.
But instead of outrage, America heaved a long sigh, 
shook its head for a few minutes and then began talk-ing about something else. We have become a coun-try so accustomed to seeing mass shootings splashed across the news that it almost seems normal to us.
This is not normal.According to the Washington Post, Americans are 
20 times more likely to be killed by a gun than citizens in other developed countries.
We cannot and should not accept this reality. We 
deserve better than these statistics, and we have to de-mand better. We have to become outraged again, or we will never see real change.
Since the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elemen-
tary School, in which 20 children and six adults were killed, Congress has passed zero gun-control laws. That means zero attempts at trying to make our coun-try safer to live in. I can only imagine how this must feel to the families who lost loved ones due to sense-less gun violence.
How many more shootings will it take before our 
lawmakers are convinced they need to take action? How many more people must die before we realize enough is enough?
Unfortunately, many people are still opposed to 
even having a conversation about gun control, despite the fact that gun violence in America has become a common event. In fact, some gun rights activists even propose we make it easier for people to buy guns and carry them in public places, arguing that more guns will make society safer from gun violence.
According to a study published by the 
American Journal of Medicine, the U.S. has the highest rates of gun ownership and also the highest rates of gun-related deaths compared to 27 other developed 
nations. More guns are not, and will never be, the an-swer.
I am not advocating for snatching guns out of the 
hands of law-abiding citizens because I recognize that many Americans are responsible and careful with their guns.
This is not a conversation about taking away rights; 
this is about increasing responsibility for all parties in-volved with purchasing and owning a gun.
The majority of Americans support universal back-
ground checks for all gun purchasers, and about 85 percent of gun owners favor background checks on private gun sales and at gun shows. Potential gun purchasers should also be screened for any mental health issues, as well as any past instances of abuse.
Bans on military assault weapons are also crucial 
steps in reducing gun violence. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence reports that military assault weapons are frequently involved in many high-pro-ﬁ  le, mass shootings, including Sandy Hook, Aurora and Columbine.
A study of mass shootings from Mayors Against 
Illegal Guns concluded that shootings conducted with assault weapons resulted in 135 percent more people shot than incidents in which less lethal weapons were used. This is not surprising considering how these semi-automatic weapons are used in our military and designed to kill as many people as possible in a small amount of time.
Appallingly, assault weapons are easily available 
for sale in most states. These deadly weapons, which are designed for times of war, have no place in our communities. We need to demand a change.
Hopefully, it will not take another tragedy to in-
spire a stand against gun violence. Otherwise, we will be forced to watch the senseless violence continue to unfold.

opinions@alligator.org“We know how to deal with 
them,” said Vice President Joe Biden on the issue of 
the the Islamic State group ear-lier this month at the Harvard 
Institute of Politics. The U.S. 
has dealt with many terrorist organizations in the past, and the Islamic State group is mere-ly the latest iteration, he said. Although the current U.S. plan to defeat the group can contain it in the short term, stabilization of the areas that it occupies will 
require diplomatic efforts be-
yond working with friends — enemies are needed as well.
The “JV Squad,” as Presi-
dent Obama characterized the Islamic State group in January, has quickly become the most well-funded, effective and ruthless group in Syria. The 
predominantly Sunni jihadist 
group aims to establish a ca-liphate throughout Syria and Iraq. It has already taken con-trol of one third of Syrian terri-tory and two of the largest cities in Iraq. Though its ruthlessness is well known, it garners local support by providing vital ser-
vices — such as electricity and 
water — to the populations it controls. This control of terri-tory provides safe havens for the Islamic State group to plan, train and recruit.
On Sept. 10, Obama pre-
sented a four-pronged strat-egy: airstrikes against Islamic 
State group targets in Iraq and 
across the border in Syria, 475 additional support forces ﬁ  ght-ing on the ground, coordina-tion with allies to cut off the Islamic State group’s funding and ﬂ  ow of foreign ﬁ  ghters and increased humanitarian aid.
Though the airstrike cam-
paign has quickly blunted the Islamic State group’s offensive, the airstrikes also inevitably result in civilian casualties and destruction, fueling anti-U.S. sentiment. Moreover, the Is-lamic State group strikes are exempt from the strict guide-lines intended to stem civilian 
casualties Obama laid out in an 
address last year. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which gets in-formation from sources on the ground, reported that 20 civil-ians have been killed in the Syr-ian village of Kobane since the middle of September.
American airstrikes may 
cause the Islamic State group to modify its tactics and integrate itself into more densely populat-ed areas, posing greater dangers to civilian populations. Many of the Islamic State group’s com-manders have experience with U.S. air power and know how 
to respond. As the effectiveness 
of pinpoint strikes diminishes, more bombs will be needed, increasing funds and the neces-sary number of aircrafts. “They hit us in some areas, and we ad-vance in others,” said a Syrian Islamic State group ﬁ  ghter in a recent CNN interview. “If we are pushed back in Iraq, we ad-vance in northern Syria. These strikes cannot stop us, our sup-port or our ﬁ  ghters.”
Furthermore, for the air-
strikes to be effective, capable troops on the ground will prob-ably be necessary to recapture and hold the territory against the Islamic State group. It is un-likely the divided Syrian rebel groups will be able to accom-plish this — there are already 
1,100 U.S. service people in 
Iraq to facilitate airstrikes and train local forces. Will 475 more make a difference? 
Based on past U.S. experi-
ence in the Middle East, military solutions are only short-term ﬁ  xes. Diplomatic and ﬁ  nancial pressures are needed from the 
U.N. to build a coalition that 
will convince Saudi Arabia to stop arming and ﬁ  nancing the Islamic State group and other extremist ﬁ  ghters, Turkey to stop allowing the Islamic State group to cross into Syria over its border and other U.S. allies in the region to avoid arm-ing all those in Syria who are against Assad.
Though Obama left out Iran 
in his speech to Washington, the U.S. must work with Iran to “degrade and ultimately de-feat” the Islamic State group, their common enemy. Unity of command and effort in Iraq will greatly strengthen the ﬁ  ght against the Islamic State group, as the Iranians are well-
equipped to be effective boots 
on the ground. By engaging Iran and supporting Iraq, the U.S. has greater control over the ﬁ  ghting and distribution of power in the region.
The U.S. has a track record 
for collaborating with its ad-versaries, and it currently al-
lies with countries that violate 
international standards. And though the U.S. does not ofﬁ  -cially condone Saudi Arabia’s draconian laws and behead-ings, Biden explained that the country will remain a key col-laborator. “It’s like saying we never should’ve collaborated with Stalin to defeat Hitler,” he said in response to a question after his speech at the Institute 
of Politics. “We knew he was an 
SOB from the beginning.”

◗ MORE THAN 50 VARIETIES OF 
GRASS WERE BRED BY UF. 
CHLOE STRADINGER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Greener pastures could lie ahead for 
Florida beef cattle producers.
Florida producers are growing two new 
grass varieties created by UF in partner-
ship with Florida Foundation Seed Produc-
ers, Inc.
The grass, which contains a better nutri-
tional value and lifespan, could save cattle-
men money, said  John C. Beuttenmuller, executive director of FFSP. 
“Being able to graze on improved qual-
ity forages that perform well prevent them from having to supplement feed and other things in their operations,” Beuttenmuller 
said.
The new grass was developed and test-
ed by four UF professors starting in 2005. 
They bred more than 50 varieties of grass and tested them for six years for persis-tence and nutritive value. The two new hy-brids, 4F and 10, were released last spring.
Joao Vendramini, an associate professor 
and forage specialist at the UF Institute of 
Food and Agricultural Sciences Range Cat-
tle Research and Education Center in Ona, helped develop the varieties.
He said the grass grows waist tall and 
thrives in warm weather.
Vendramini said the grass spreads by 
planting the cut stems, which is a longer process and more labor-intensive than growing by seeds.  
The FFSP worked with the Florida Cat-
tlemen’s Association to select a handful of producers to start growing the grass from north and south Florida.
Only a few producers are currently 
growing it because of its limited availabil-ity, Beuttenmuller said.
The group of producers will pay annual 
membership dues of $25 to FFSP. Produc-
ers will also pay a one-time fee to offset the 
costs of development.
Current producers will cut the grass va-
rieties in July and pass along the stems to other producers who can plant it on their land and spread it around Florida.New grass varieties made by UF may benefit beef cattle producersRACHEL WELSH

Millions of years ago, 50-foot sharks 
swam, hunted and killed, and one UF stu-
dent believes he has the tooth to prove it.
Steven Pensabene, a 23-year-old UF ag-
riculture operations management junior, found a 5-inch tooth in the sandy soil of a Gainesville creek.
Although the serrated tooth is big enough 
to fill Pensabene’s palm, it is split down the 
center — the other half still undiscovered. 
Pensabene has been searching for shark teeth since he was 3 years old.
Pensabene and other shark fanatics are 
stoked for all of the Megalodon develop-ments at UF.
Last Wednesday, UF released a study 
proving the Megalodon species became ex-
tinct 2.6 million years ago, disproving the 
idea the sharks might still be alive.
Lead research author Catalina Pimiento 
collaborated with Christopher Clements from the University of Zurich for the study. 
Their findings provided insight on Megal-
odon’s past.
“The extinction of modern sharks is very 
worrying,” Pimiento said. “They maintain the stability of marine ecosystems. Their extinction can negatively affect entire food webs.”
The researchers used data from recent 
Megalodon records to calculate the shark’s extinction date.
The Florida Museum of Natural History 
is working to fight shark extinction.
Its exhibit “Megalodon: Largest Shark 
that Ever Lived” was created in 2008 and be-came so popular the Florida Museum took it on tour across the country.
Katina Prokos, marketing assistant for the 
Florida Museum, said there were numerous 
requests from museumgoers to bring the ex-
hibit back to Gainesville.
“People have a fascination — maybe a morbid curiosity — because of movies like ‘Jaws’ and shows like ‘Shark Week,’” Prokos said. “We want to educate as well as inspire because sharks are currently in population decline.”
Prokos said the decline is caused by over-
fishing and climate change. A heavy focus on shark conservation is new to the exhibit.
According to the Florida Museum, a 60-
foot Megalodon could have weighed up to 77 tons.
At the exhibit, which will run until Jan. 
4, visitors can touch Megalodon teeth and view fossils from Panama.
The event is free to UF students with a 
valid Gator 1 Card.
Pensabene said he plans to visit the ex-
hibit to learn more about some of the shark 
teeth he has collected over the years, includ-
ing his newest 5-inch addition.Megalodon Mania: UF study proves species most likely extinct

A Gainesville man was arrested 
early Monday after police said he 
snatched and threw his ex-boyfriend’s 
ankle monitor before stealing his cell 
phone. 
Jevon Terrell Battles, 22, ap-
proached his ex-boyfriend of seven 
months, Steven Curtis Janky, while he 
was walking on the sidewalk Sunday shortly after midnight, according to a report. Janky is on house arrest and had a monitor on him per standard 
procedure. 
Upon confrontation, Battles grabbed 
Janky’s monitor out of his pocket, caus-
ing Janky’s pants to rip. Battles then threw the monitor to a nearby yard before reaching into Janky’s pockets again and taking his cell phone. 
While trying to defend himself, 
Janky pushed Battles away, giving Bat-tles a swollen eye and a scratch on his chest, Gainesville Police spokesman Officer Ben Tobias wrote in an email. 
Battles then left the area with 
Janky’s phone. He later returned to Janky’s home Monday, located at 907 NW 40th Terrace, where he was ar-rested shortly before 2 a.m. 
Battles was arrested on charges of 
robbery and battery. His bond is set at $30,000. 
In 2012, Battles was arrested on

NASHVILLE, Tenn. — A Methodist pas-
tor who was disciplined after he officiated at 
the wedding of his gay son will be allowed to remain an ordained minister.
The Judicial Council of the nation’s sec-
ond-largest Protestant denomination ruled Monday that a Pennsylvania church jury was wrong to defrock Frank Schaefer last year af-ter he would not promise to never perform another same-sex wedding.
The council ruled on technical grounds 
and did not express support for gay marriage in general. Its decision is final.
Reached by phone after the decision, 
Schaefer called it “amazing.”
He said he was pleased, “not just for my-
self, but for everyone in the LGBTQ commu-nity and the church.”
“This is a positive decision that keeps the 
dialogue going,” he said. “They didn’t bar a person who is an outspoken activist and who has said that, if asked, he would perform an-other gay marriage.”
Although the United Methodist Church 
has welcomed gay and lesbian members, the church’s Book of Discipline rejects sex out-side of heterosexual marriage as “incompat-ible with Christian teaching.”
Since his church trial, Schaefer has become 
a gay rights activist, galvanizing other Meth-odists who support full inclusion of gays and lesbians in the church.
Following his Wednesday hearing before 
the Judicial Council, Schaefer said he had no regrets for his actions.
When his son first came out to him as gay, 
Schaefer said he learned that church doctrine had made his son believe he could not go to heaven.
“He did not want to live any more. He 
was in so much pain,” Schaefer said. 
So when his son asked Schaefer to officiate 
at his wedding, the minister accepted.
“I did what I did based on my heart and 
my conscience,” he said.Pastor who performed son’s

ORLANDO — Jury selection 
in the trial of Dante Martin, one of 
the four remaining former Flori-da A&M University band mem-bers charged with felony hazing 
and manslaughter in the death of 
a drum major, is set to move to a second day, while trials for the three other remaining defendants have been postponed until April. The trial began nearly three years after drum major Robert Cham-pion died from being beaten.
Earlier Monday, Judge Renee 
Roche delayed the trials for de-fendants Benjamin McNamee, Aaron Golson and Darryl Cear-nel after their attorneys said they did not have the opportunity to question witnesses about hazing charges that were added to the case.
All four have pleaded not 
guilty in the death of Champion, of Decatur, Georgia. He died from what authorities say was a hazing ritual in November 2011.
His death has shined a spot-
light on a hazing ritual at FAMU known as “crossing Bus C” and caused the band — which had played at the Super Bowl and 
before U.S. presidents — to be 
suspended for more than a year. It also contributed to the resigna-tion of the university’s president.
Hours after a football game in 
Orlando, band members boarded Bus C, which was parked outside a hotel. They pummeled Cham-pion, 26, and two other band 
members as they tried to wade their way through a pounding 
gauntlet of ﬁ  sts, drumsticks and mallets from the front to the back of the bus.
After making it to the back, 
Champion vomited and com-plained of trouble breathing. 
He soon fell unconscious and 
couldn’t be revived. He died from hemorrhagic shock and his autopsy showed extensive inter-nal bleeding.
Fifteen former band members 
originally were charged in the 
incident. Eleven had their cases 
settled, and several of them will be called as witnesses to describe what happened on the bus.
State Attorney Jeff Ashton said 
he wants jurors to learn about the history of hazing in FAMU’s marching band so they under-stand what happened on the bus was a “consistent pattern.”
Besides “crossing Bus C,” ju-
rors likely will learn about other hazing rituals by band members. Those include “the hot seat,” when band members sit in bus seats with heads between legs as other band members beat them, as well as “prepping,” when a shirtless band member is slapped on the back and chest.
“They got on the bus for one 
thing, and that is to break the law,” Ashton said at a recent hear-ing. “The jury has to understand this wasn’t an isolated incident, that these four defendants knew what they were doing and that they were breaking the law.”
Defense attorneys have chal-
lenged Florida’s anti-hazing law, claiming the statute is so vague that what happened on the band bus can be considered a competi-tion, not hazing.
“The hazing statute, the way 
it is written is crazy,” Dino Mi-chaels, one of the attorneys for Martin, said at a recent hearing.
Roche denied a defense mo-
tion asking that the hazing stat-ute be ruled unconstitutional, but she reached a compromise with defense attorneys and Ashton on whether witnesses can say the word “hazing” during the trial. The judge ruled witnesses could use the word “hazing” if they had 
previously read the statute deﬁ  n-
ing it, such as in the anti-hazing pledges FAMU band members had to sign even before Cham-pion’s death.
Defense attorneys and pros-
ecutors agreed no band members have said in depositions that Champion’s sexual orientation 
played a role in the hazing, so 
the fact that he was gay won’t be brought up during the trial.

Florida-Vanderbilt time announced
Florida football’s matchup with Vanderbilt on Nov. 9 is set to kickoff 
at 7:30. The game — UF’s ﬁ  fth night game of the season — will be televised on the SEC Network.Alhassan honored again
UF volleyball freshman middle blocker Rhamat Alhassan was tabbed the SEC Freshman of the Week on Monday.A.J. Crouch is tied for ﬁ  rst place in the UF men’s golf team’s ﬁ  nal fall tournament. Read 
the story on Page 16.In our culture, we elevate sports to the status of war, and we do that most often with football. Ath-letes are warriors, games are battles and rivalry 
series are wars. 
It’s a logical leap to make. Football is based on 
gaining territory — something Florida struggles 
with. One side gains lands while the other attempts 
to stop them, even battling “in the trenches” to bor-row the phrase popularized during World War I.
Florida plays its annual border war against 
Georgia this week, and UF’s general is as embattled as they come.
His battalion is under siege, not just from oppo-
nents like the Bulldogs but from supporters, those that chanted “ﬁ  re Muschamp,” the chant Mus-
champ said he had to explain to his nine-year-old 
son. Muschamp said that because of that, he and his team have taken on a “bunker mentality.”
“Every week is the same during the season,” 
Muschamp said. “It’s groundhog day as far as hours, time, time spent watching ﬁ  lm. I’m hardly ever in my ofﬁ  ce, I’m in the staff room constantly you know, constantly helping 
them get ready for a game. 
Complete bunker mentality during the season.”
This is where the season 
stands now for a Florida team that isn’t expected to 
bounce back signiﬁ  cantly in its last ﬁ  ve games. This is Stage 2 in the common three-step progression of a struggling team, the point in the year that comes af-
ter the optimism of a new year has been suffocated 
by the reality of that year’s adversity.
We won’t know if Step 2 in a ﬂ  edgling team’s 
progression will result in a reversal of fortunes. Florida is yet to be mathematically eliminated from

Although Todd Gurley is 
currently suspended by the 
NCAA, Florida coach Will 
Muschamp said he is certain 
the Georgia tailback will suit up for Saturday’s matchup in Jacksonville.
“Absolutely. I would ex-
pect him to play,” Muschamp said.
Gurley has missed the 
Bulldogs’ past two games 
while the NCAA conducted 
an investigation on whether he signed memorabilia for proﬁ  t. However, Georgia ap-
plied for Gurley’s reinstate-
ment last week and expects the NCAA to be prompt in 
its ruling.
“I think we as an institu-
tion and Todd as a student-
athlete did everything within the protocol of the governing body, the NCAA, so hope-
fully it all will end well and 
hopefully sooner than later,” Georgia coach Mark Richt said last week.
In the ﬁ  ve games prior to 
his suspension, Gurley av-eraged 154.6 yards per con-test while racking up eight touchdowns.
The junior running back 
scorched Florida for two scores during last season’s annual rivalry matchup. Gurley recorded a game-high 100 yards off 17 carries as well.
“Extremely talented run-
ning back in Todd Gurley,” Muschamp said. “One of the best football players in col-
lege football. He’s a violent 
runner. He’s a great compet-itor, a guy that really com-petes on every down in what he does.”
Jeff Driskel’s role with 
the team: After benching redshirt junior Jeff Driskel in favor of freshman Treon Har-
ris, Muschamp said he still 
would have a role for Driskel in the offense for Florida’s game against Georgia.
However, Muschamp has 
not yet decided on the extent of the veteran quarterback’s involvement.
“Jeff’s had a sore back a 
little bit,” Muschamp said. “He missed most of last week as far as just getting 
some rest with him. But he’ll 
be back at practice (Monday) and be ready to go. And we’ll Notebook: UF expects

On its deepest roster since at least 1996, 
Florida volleyball has offered fans a mix-
ture of players ranging from a duo of set-
ters to six defensive specialist options.
One of those defensive specialists is already becoming 
an integral piece to 
Florida’s future.
Freshman Sam 
Dubiel is one of two freshman defensive 
specialists that have been tabbed by coach 
Mary Wise and the rest of the Florida 
coaching staff to become the future of the back row. 
A feat that would seem heavy for a 
freshman that has only played in three 
matches and four sets.“I’ve been really working hard in 
practice and getting support from other teammates and so when we went in, I re-
ally looked to them, they had that support with me,” Dubiel said. “… I think going in I have that mind set, ‘Oh just be ready to 
do whatever I can,’ so next year I’m ready 
for a bigger role.”
The 5-foot-6 freshman has been adapt-
ing to Florida’s fast-paced offensive style in her couple of months with the team. 
Dubiel — a big recruit because of her two consecutive Class 3A state cham-pionships with Wheaton St. Francis as 
the libero — played in her ﬁ  rst match of 
the season against Georgia on Oct. 10, in which she didn’t put up any stats but had the opportunity to get her feet wet in col-
lege play.
Her next match was against Texas A&M 
where she got the opportunity to show off 
her biggest asset to the team yet: a work-Freshman making strides, preparing for big role on squad

Twenty-eight former Gators saw playing 
time in Week 8 of NFL action. Here are some of 
the highlight performances.
Joe Haden, Cleveland Browns: Joe Ha-
den continues to be a lockdown corner for the Browns.
In Cleveland’s 23-13 win against the 
Oakland Raiders on Sunday, the fifth-year cornerback and former first-round draft pick recorded a team-best nine tackles — one of which was for loss — defended two 
passes and recovered a fumble.
On the season, Haden has 38 total tack-
les and five pass deflections.
Sharrif Floyd, Minnesota Vikings: For 
the second straight week, Floyd posted 
career-best numbers.
One week after logging five tackles 
against the Buffalo Bills, Floyd responded 
with a career-high eight tackles — seven 
of which were solo stops — during Min-nesota’s 19-13 win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
The second-year veteran also recorded 
his third sack of the season on Sunday, which puts him in a tie for fourth on the Vikings’ roster this season.
In seven games, Floyd has amassed 24 
tackles.Riley Cooper, Philadelphia Eagles: 
Riley Cooper may have been quarterback 
Nick Foles’ second option in Philadelphia’s 
24-20 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, but Cooper still had an impact in the game.
The fifth-year wide receiver hauled in five passes for 88 yards, including a 50-yard catch and run in the second quarter.
Cooper was one of four Philadelphia 
players with at least five catches and 44 receiving yards on Sunday, as Foles threw for 411 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions.
On the season, Cooper has 305 receiv-
ing yards on 29 receptions. 
He has at least four catches in all but 
one game this year.
Percy Harvin, New York Jets: Percy 
Harvin wasted no time getting acclimated to his new team.
In the Jets’ 43-23 loss to the Buffalo Bills 
— Harvin’s first game since being traded 
by the Seattle Seahawks for a conditional 
draft pick — Harvin recorded 194 all-pur-pose yards (22 receiving, 28 rushing, 144 kick return).
Notes: With regular starter Janoris Jen-
kins inactive on Sunday with a knee in-jury, undrafted rookie Marcus Roberson earned his first career start during the St. Louis Rams’ 34-7 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. The undrafted rookie finished the 
game with four tackles 
The Arizona Cardinals added rookie 
wide receiver Solomon Patton to their 
practice squad on Saturday. Patton was 
originally a member of the Buccaneers be-
fore being waived on Oct. 21.
Former Gators and current Cincinnati 
Bengals Carlos Dunlap and Reggie Nel-son combined for nine total tackles in the 
Bengals’ 27-24 win against the Baltimore 
Ravens.14, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 2014

The College Football Play-
off committee unveils its first 
ever top 25 ranking for the 2014 
season tonight at 7:30 p.m. on 
ESPN. 
This also includes the four 
teams that would make the play-
off if the season were to have 
ended last Saturday. 
Those four teams would also 
be projected to go to the two semifinal bowl games — which 
rotate yearly. 
This semifinal bowl games 
this year are the Rose and Sugar 
Bowls, which will both be played 
on New Year’s Day. 
The National Championship 
will be played 11 days later on 
Jan. 12, 2015. 
Let’s take a look at who 
makes up the committee, the cri-teria that goes into the rankings and I’ll give my top four teams through week nine. 
The Committee:The playoff committee is 
made up of 12 members, includ-ing former and current athletic directors, former collegiate and 
NFL players and coaches and 
former conference commission-ers. 
There are also a few powerful 
former members of the United States Government and Armed Forces. 
Some of the more recogniz-able names include former head coach and athletic director at Nebraska Tom Osborne, former Secretary of State Condoleezza 
Rice and current Wisconsin ath-
letics director Barry Alvarez. 
The idea is to eliminate com-
puters from affecting rankings, 
like the way previous BCS rank-
ings were picked. 
It is also important to note 
that committee members will be recused from participating in 
votes involving a school’s team 
if they or an immediate family member receives compensation from the school, or has a pro-
fessional relationship with that 
school. 
For example, Alvarez will 
not be able to take part when the committee votes on where to 
rank Wisconsin.  
Criteria:
It’s safe to say that the com-
mittee has one of the toughest 
jobs in college football—picking 
the top 25 teams out of the 128 FBS schools. Good luck. 
But what will the committee 
emphasize when putting togeth-
er their list of 25? 
According to the playoff’s 
website:
“The committee will select 
the teams using a process that 
distinguishes among otherwise comparable teams by consider-ing conference championships won, strength of schedule, head-to-head competition, compara-tive outcomes of common oppo-nents (without incenting margin of victory) and other relevant 
factors that may have affected a 
team’s performance during the season or likely will affect its postseason performance.” 
Obviously the most important 
aspect that can be measured up to this point is strength of sched-ule, which includes conference and out-of-conference games.
Morgan’s Top Four: 1. Mississippi State: The 
Bulldogs are one of just four re-maining unbeaten teams in the 
country, and play in the toughest 
conference in college football. 
2. Alabama: Yes, they have 
one loss, but that came on the road in Oxford, Miss., facing Ole 
Miss, which — despite losing 
a close one on the road to LSU this week — still boasts the most complete defense in the coun-
try. 
3. Florida State: The Semi-
noles’ win over then-No. 5 Notre 
Dame proved they were wor-thy of making the playoff. And 
they’re riding a 23-game win 
streak. 
4. Oregon: Another one loss 
team, but in their loss to Arizona 
three weeks ago they were miss-
ing their starting left tackle. The committee has stated that they’ll take into account if a team’s best player is missing during a loss.Breaking down the CFB Playoff

Haden lockdown at corner; Floyd has career weekin-progress, soon to be unbeat-
able, float serve.
“It’s a work in progress,” Wise 
said. “Her serve will probably look very different at the end of her career, but right now she’s a consistent server who, whether 
it’s in practice or even the match, 
we feel very comfortable about her ability to locate, and I just think her speed and her locations are just going to get better.” 
With her growth on the serve 
and little bit of time that she is getting in matches, Dubiel is showing hints of why she will be 
one of Florida’s starting defen-
sive specialists come January.
Dubiel will be sharing time on 
the court with freshman Lind-sey Rogers and junior Nikki O’Rourke. 
Of the three, Rogers is the only 
defensive specialist – a former 
outside hitter for her club team – 
that has yet to play this season.
“Sam, as with Lindsey and 
Nikki O’Rourke, are the future,” Wise said. 
“The roster will look very dif-
ferent come January when the three seniors and all their expe-rience graduates. All three that I just mentioned – Sam, Lindsey 
and Nikki – though they are not 
getting the playing time in the matches, it’s just by numbers and number of substitutions that we’re limited. We’re seeing every-
day in practice, their growth.”identify those things moving forward.”
Driskel had to be helped off the field last week 
against Missouri when he was sacked late in the first half. After the game, Muschamp said Driskel had the 
air knocked out of him and the injury was nothing serious.
Turnover margins: Heading into this week in col-
lege football, Georgia leads the nation with a plus-13 
turnover margin.
The Bulldogs also have the fewest turnovers in the 
country with just four recorded in seven games.
“That’s the reason why they are where they are,” 
Muschamp said. 
“One fumble and three interceptions. They take 
care of the football.”
On the flip side, Florida is tied for 59th with an 
even turnover margin at zero while racking up 16 turnovers in six contests.
After the Gators’ first two games against Eastern 
Michigan and Kentucky, they recorded a turnover 
margin of plus-7, which was among the best in col-
lege football.
But in its past two losses, Florida has lost the ball 
nine times including six last week against Missouri.
“We have the ball security period every single 
day that we’ve been doing for two years now, so, we changed up some things we were doing as far as that 
was concerned, but just continuing taking care of the football,” Muschamp said. 
“You can’t turn it over six times and win. It’s not 
going to happen.”
the Southeastern Conference 
title game and would need an additional loss from Georgia and three by Missouri as well as wins against its remaining 
conference schedule to gain a 
trip to Atlanta.
So, into the bunker they 
go with helmets on and bay-onets fashioned. 
There is a new plan of 
attack devised using the freshman Treon Harris at quarterback and bringing in 
reinforcements, like Bran-
don Powell, who Muschamp said will have a “significant role.”
Florida’s players, to their 
credit did what they were supposed to do publicly voicing support for their leader, one some of them see 
as a pseudo-father figure.
“It’s just unfortunate that 
being, especially in this con-
ference, that this conference just demands so much out of a coach,” offensive lineman Max Garcia said. “But we’re just there to support him any way we can. And you know 
just to love him like he loves us.”
Added linebacker Mike 
Taylor: “The people that are 
saying that are not out there coaching with them, not be-ing coached by him, they’re not playing on Saturday. They got the tickets, they have the tickets, they have Twitters, you know, they have all that stuff. And they 
can voice their opinions. 
There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s somewhere in the Constitution, in one of those amendments, where you can voice your opinion, you know, it’s not facts.”
I don’t question their sin-
cerity. And as leaders they’re both genuinely stepping up to the plate and joining their coach in the bunker mental-ity.
But what happens if the 
bunker busts? 
Then comes the folding 
up of the tents if the season still isn’t going well in the waning days of November.
It’s bunker mentality time 
for the Gators as they trudge onwards to battlefields in Jacksonville, Nashville then back home again. 
If it doesn’t work, Florida 
will be looking for a new man to lead the troops next fall.Florida players

 After enduring its first two-loss week-
end of the year, Florida righted the ship 
and once again proved that it is one of the 
nation’s best soccer teams.
The eighth-ranked Gators defeated Ten-
nessee and LSU last weekend in dominat-
ing fashion, getting back to their winning 
ways and their conference prominence.
After dropping two games in a row on 
Oct. 16 and Oct. 19 to South Carolina and 
Kentucky, it was important for Florida to regain its composure heading toward 
the end of the regular season and into the 
Southeastern Conference tournament next week.
“I think it was going to be really critical 
how we responded after that past week-end,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “I like the way our team responded, particularly on Friday night. … We hadn’t dominated like that in quite some time, so it was good 
to see.”
Florida out shot Tennessee 27-9 on Fri-
day and beat the Volunteers 3-1 on the 
Gators’ senior night.
Florida then traveled to Baton Rouge, La., on Sunday and shut out LSU 3-0, out-shooting the Tigers 17-7.
With their strong performance over 
the weekend, the Gators are now just one point behind Texas A&M in the SEC stand-ings with only one regular season game re-maining. 
Florida hosts Vanderbilt on Thursday.“We can only control our part of the 
equation, which is we need to come out with three points,” Burleigh said. “For us, it’s not even just getting the result, it’s about what are we doing as far as pro-gressing as we head into the SEC tourna-ment and the NCAA tournament.”
A big key for the Gators approaching 
postseason play will be the production of sophomore forward Savannah Jordan.
Jordan was recognized on Monday as 
the SEC Offensive Player of the Week — 
the third time she has received the honor 
this season. 
Jordan scored three goals in Florida’s 
two wins over the weekend. She now leads 
the SEC with 14 on the year.
Jordan was also nationally recognized 
as the Capital One Cup Impact Performer 
of the Week with her two-goal performance in Florida’s victory against Tennessee. 
It was Jordan’s third multi-goal game 
of the year and tenth of her career.
Florida will need Jordan to keep play-
ing at a high level as it closes in on the 
postseason. 
With just one regular season game left, 
the Gators are preparing for their ultimate 
goal, but they are making sure to cherish every last day of this season.
“I don’t want this season to go by fast, 
it’s already gone by too fast for me,” Bur-leigh said. “I’m really enjoying working with this group of women, and I think we 
want to just take these things one at a time. 
… We’re gonna savor the moment.”16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 28, 2014
