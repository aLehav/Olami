A new U.S. News & World Report ranking of 2015’s best 
law schools placed Florida State University above UF, and 
some UF law students aren’t happy.
Robert Jerry, the dean of UF’s Levin College of Law, held 
a meeting with about 20 law students Wednesday to address their concerns about what this ranking means for the col-lege.
Out of the 146 schools evaluated, UF’s law college placed 
49th, and FSU was 45th. UF has consistently ranked in the high 40s since 2008, but rival FSU has slowly caught up over the years until this year, when it jumped ahead as UF fell behind three places.
Jerry explained that not only is the methodology of the 
ranking system questionable, but also several universities have been working the system in their favor to climb the ranks — including FSU.
“I said for many years that U.S. News rankings are worth-
less, but we ignore them at our peril,” he said. “This rank-VOLUME 108 ISSUE 114 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG THURSDAY, MARCH 13, 2014

Laverne Cox, a producer, actress and 
advocate for the transgender community, 
will be the keynote speaker for Women’s History Month and Pride Awareness Month.Cox is well-known 
for her role as Sophia, a transgender woman, on the show “Orange is the New Black,” said Taylor Novak, president of the Women’s Student Asso-
ciation.
“She redeﬁ  nes what it 
means to be an empow-
ered woman,” said Jasmine Esmailbegui, 
the executive director for Women’s His-tory Month in WSA.
The event will take place at 7 p.m. on 
March 24 in the University Auditorium. The event is free to attend, and tickets will be handed out at the door. Novak said she thinks the turnout will ﬁ  ll the auditorium.
Cox will present her talk, Ain’t I a Wom-

Women’s History Month, Pride Aware-ness Month and the Hispanic Student As-sociation are coming together to bring Cox to speak at UF for about $16,000, Novak said.
Esmailbegui, a 21-year-old UF criminol-
ogy and psychology senior, said the femi-nist movement has often left out many dif-
ferent types of women who aren’t upper 
class and white.
“This year,” she said, “we want to high-
light women who might not have neces-sarily been recognized in the past.”

With the help of police dog 
Roo, Gainesville Police arrested 
a local man Tuesday after police said he and his brother broke into a house. 
Police are still searching for 
the brother but said the pair used a dresser drawer to hit a woman during the burglary.
Ofﬁ  cers arrested 24-year-old 
Anthony Lamar Douglas II on charges of burglary and theft, ac-cording to an arrest report.
At about 12:45 p.m., Douglas 
and his brother broke into a house on the 3700 block of Northwest 20th Place through an unlocked bathroom window, according to the report.
A woman inside the house hid 
in her bedroom closet and called 911. 
According to the report, when 
Douglas and his brother entered, they found her and hit her with a dresser drawer.
When ofﬁ  cers arrived with a police dog named Roo, they saw the brothers leave through the front door and then run back in-side. 
Ofﬁ  cers released Roo and 
stopped Douglas. 
Douglas’ brother, who hasn’t 
been identiﬁ  ed by police, ran out the back door of the house. 
The men stole items from the 
house including jewelry, a Mac-Book laptop and a wallet, accord-ing to the report. Ofﬁ  cers found a bag contain-
ing the items on the path Doug-las’ brother took to escape.
During questioning, Douglas 
said the robbery was his broth-er’s idea. 
Douglas also had an active 
warrant out for escaping jail, ac-cording to the report.
Ofﬁ  cers booked Douglas into 
the Alachua County Jail at 7 p.m., where he remained as of press time in lieu of a $135,000 bond.

A Florida man on a mission to bring 
awareness to immigration issues stopped in 
Gainesville on Wednesday after a 450-mile bike ride.
Francisco Diaz, 41, is an undocumented 
immigrant from Mexico who has lived in the United States for 14 years. He plans to ride his bike across about 1,200 miles from Miami to Washington, D.C., on a mission called Pedal-ing for 20 Million Dreams. His goal is to hand President Barack Obama a pen to sign an ex-ecutive order that will stop deportations in the U.S.
He began his journey March 2 and has been 
pedaling his way north.
At a press conference hosted by the UF In-
stitute of Hispanic-Latino Cultures, Diaz said he believes stopping deportations is a neces-sary start to ongoing immigration reform. 
“Immigration reform is later, but I think we 
have to go step by step,” Diaz said. “And the ﬁ  rst step is to stop deportations.”
Cristobal Gonzalez, a 22-year-old UF soci-
ology master’s student, hosted Diaz during his stay in Gainesville. 
“I’m interested to see 
how much support he will 
receive and how effective 
his efforts are,” Gonzalez 
said.
During Wednesday’s 
conference, Diaz showed listeners the small Ameri-can ﬂ  ag that waves out of his backpack as he rides.
 “I carry the ﬂ  ag because I feel like I am a 
part of the United States,” he said.
Diaz said he didn’t train for the extensive 
biking his journey requires, but when he be-gins to struggle physically, he remembers the stories of the people who have been affected by deportation. 
“I have seen my family become broken,” 
Diaz said. “So I say, ‘No more families bro-ken.’”Undocumented man biking

Methodology can be ﬂ  awed
ing does create peril when it’s used by 
people who don’t understand it.”
He said factors such as the percent-
age of transfer students admitted to a college and its calculations of expen-ditures can be manipulated to boost scores. About half of FSU’s law student 
admissions were transfer students 
in 2013 compared to UF’s 12 percent.  FSU’s costs have also been shifted to make direct expenditures per student much higher — both of which help the 
university increase ranking. 
Location has been shown to skew 
results for evaluating employment, too, 
as FSU’s Tallahassee location places it 
close to state-government employers.
“Anyone who thinks we ought to 
do some of those things, as I told the 
faculty yesterday afternoon, will sim-ply need to wait on the next dean,” he 
said.
Jerry will be leaving ofﬁ  ce in three 
months, and he said he hopes the new 
dean’s fresh start will take the college in a positive direction.
He also said regardless of rank, UF’s 
reputation carries signiﬁ  cant weight in the professional realm.
“Our graduates are getting good 
jobs,” he said. “They’re getting real jobs.”
Although the dean said measures 
will be taken to improve UF’s ranking, law students like Brett Williams are 
still skeptical.
Williams, a 26-year-old UF third-
year law student, said the dip in rank 
seemed to have caught the faculty off 
guard, and now the college is scram-
bling to catch up.
“If the ranking system is being 
gamed and we know the game, why aren’t we doing it, too?” he said. “I 
have to walk into a ﬁ  rm not knowing 
how they’ll feel about my law school.” “This ranking does create 
peril when it’s used by people 
who don’t understand it.”

On Tuesday, media outlets buzzed with the news that Re-
publican David Jolly won the Florida District 13 U.S. House 
seat. District 13, according to the Washington Post, is a Gulf 
district west of Tampa. The Post called the election the “ﬁ  rst major test of voter attitudes in 2014,” because Jolly’s main platform — and selling point, many say — was his promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. 
His opponent, 2010 gubernatorial nominee Democrat Alex 
Sink, told voters Obamacare should be preserved but ﬁ  xed. 
According to Washington Post writer Sean Sullivan, “A 
former lobbyist, Jolly will head to Congress to succeed his 
old boss, late-Rep. C.W. Bill Young. Young, a moderate 
known for steering federal dollars to the district, served for more than four decades and was practically political royalty there. He died last fall, opening the door for Democrats in a swing district that narrowly went for Obama in 2012.”
The race was closely watched from the beginning. Whereas Sink, a seasoned Democratic politician and for-
mer Chief Financial Ofﬁ  cer for the state of Florida, had mon-ey to spend on the campaign, Jolly was just a lobbyist. 
Republicans argue that Jolly’s win in District 13 against 
a “well-known, well-funded Democrat,” according to the Washington Post, should alert the nation that even voters in Democratic districts want Obamacare out. Jolly’s campaign and TV ads relied heavily on his opposition to Obamacare and his determination to repeal it. 
On the other side, Democrats argue Jolly’s success isn’t 
the underdog story Republicans purport it to be. 
“’In a special election with an electorate tilted heavily for 
Republicans, Democrat Alex Sink came closer to victory than any Democrat in decades — especially with 10 Republican outside groups spending $5 million in the race,’ read a memo put out by House Democrats after the loss,” the Post report-ed. 
It all boils down to one fundamental question: Is the Flor-
ida special-election victory at the hands of Republicans in-dicative of what will happen during the midterm elections this November?
It’s possible. “Elections have consequences,” Washington Post political 
analyst Chris Cillizza wrote. “Whether or not what happened Tuesday in Florida is a bellwether of anything, it will unnerve Democrats and energize Republicans. And, that matters.”
Democrats should be worried about this Republican win; 
that Jolly, a ﬁ  rst-time candidate, beat Sink, who had both name recognition, a track record for getting votes — she lost to Scott in 2010 by a 1 percent margin — and money to burn 
is a big deal. 
Jolly’s win is a small but signiﬁ  cant victory for Repub-
licans, and Democrats now have a reason to watch their 
backs. GOP takes Florida

Nestled between Gainesville and Jacksonville is 
what some news outlets have nicknamed the most corrupt city in the nation: Hampton, popu-
lation 477. 
It’s likely that by the end of the month, the doors to its 
city hall will be shut forever.
The corruption there stems from where it always does: 
money. Hampton’s money came from a brutal speed trap on a 1,260-foot stretch of U.S. 301. 
That stretch wasn’t always within Hampton’s borders, 
but its annexation in the early 1990s gave the city a new revenue source. In 2011, 9,515 speeding tickets written in a 
town of fewer than 500 people brought in $253,000, CNN 
reported.
The town has about one police ofﬁ  cer for every 25 peo-
ple. The ofﬁ  cers sit on the side of the highway, lounging 
in lawn chairs with radar guns, waiting for unsuspecting 
drivers. One ofﬁ  cer — called Rambo by residents — gave out tickets in full SWAT gear with an AR-15 strapped to his chest.
The tickets may have caused the corruption, but it 
didn’t stop there. Police ofﬁ  cers were seen using their ve-hicles off duty. 
They’d even bring their own gas cans when they ﬁ  lled 
up so they could get more on the city’s dime. The mayor 
has been in jail since Thanksgiving time for dealing oxy-
codone.
The city clerk was overpaid by about $9,000. Now, all 
the employees have quit because the money has dried up in the wake of an audit from Tallahassee. Talk about a 
government shutdown.
According to CNN, “‘It’s a mess,’ Dan Krassner, the 
group’s (Integrity Florida) co-founder, said of the situa-
tion in Hampton. ‘Clearly, there has been misuse of public 
funds and lack of oversight. The cronyism and nepotism 
is out of control.’”
These aren’t even all the issues the city faces. But the most corrupt city in America has a lesson to teach us about the growing disconnection between 
the government and the gov-
erned. 
The mayor of the city talked 
to CNN from jail, orange jump-
suit and all. He pointed ﬁ  ngers 
at everyone but himself — and 
ended up resigning Tuesday.
The city has been given one last chance to redeem itself. 
But without a staff, it’s unlikely Hampton will be able to 
ﬁ  x the policies that led it to break local, state and federal 
laws a total of 31 times.
Keep in mind this has been going on for years without 
notice. If corruption this blatant has a home in the Sun-
shine State, there’s no telling what else gets by. 
Issues like these show why people need to be engaged 
with their governments. We’re coming to a crossroad in 
our nation’s history. The federal government is plagued by increasing partisanship and deadlock in the legislature. 
The executive branch is spying on U.S. citizens like no 
other time in American history. Our economy is still re-covering from the recession, while the current technologi-cal revolution and corrupt corporations alike threaten to 
upend the little recovery we have seen.
But it’s not just the federal government that’s broken. 
Local governments have a better reputation. They’re sup-
posedly more responsive to constituents and better ﬁ  t to ﬁ  x local ailments. This example in Gainesville’s backyard 
shows that even at the smallest scale, our politics are bro-
ken. The needs of the people are being shoved aside for the wants of a few. 
The solution won’t come from them — it comes from 
you.

With the winter weather behind us, 
we’re slowly starting to enter music fes-
tival season.
Many people are rushing to make a 
serious dent in their bank accounts and grab a ticket to Bonnaroo, Warped Tour or any of the other big festivals happening nearby. It’s definitely a unique experience going to one of these events for the first 
time, so we’ve asked some seasoned UF 
festival buffs to give advice to first timers. Although the bulk of festivals are during  the summer, Bonnaroo tickets are on sale now and Lollapalooza sales are around the corner. It doesn’t hurt to start getting 
ready early.
 
Clothing:The best attire for any music festival is 
comfort. With a lot of people crammed to-
gether outside, it’s often more important 
to avoid the heat when getting dressed for a day of music.
Valerie Melina, an 18-year-old UF 
French and Spanish freshman, said that in her experience, everyone tended to wear tank tops, shorts and sneakers.
“Girls generally wear high-waisted 
shorts and a loose tank top or crop top. 
Guys wear shorts and either a tank top 
or no shirt at all,” said Melina, who has gone to three festivals. “Don’t wear heavy clothes, unless you wear layers, so you 
don’t overheat.”
Nick Chrone, a 19-year old UF civil 
engineering sophomore, said he usually 
wears shorts and a T-shirt of a band that  is performing.
“It’s not a code or anything,” Chrone 
said. “You just definitely want to be com-fortable.”
Where to Stand:Finding the right place to watch the 
music is essential because with the most passionate fans in the front of the stage, close proximity could get you hurt.
Melina said she would rather stay in 
the pit, despite the possibility of getting pushed or hurt.
“Being in the pit is lots of fun, though,  
as long as you know what you’re getting into,” she said. “It’s my preferred place.”
Melike Aydyn, a 23-year-old UF com-
puter science master’s student, said she didn’t like being in the front.
“I actually stand far away so at the 
same time I can listen to music and chat with my friends without getting pushed in a crowd,” Aydyn said. “I had a friend 
that got a broken leg because people were 
pushing with the music.”
 Food:With overpriced food and drinks sold 
at the festival, it’s important to bring your own. At an outdoor event, make sure to bring a lot of water and some substantial food to keep your energy level high so 
you can enjoy the festivities throughout 
the day. 
Many people faint at concerts and fes-
tivals because they’re dehydrated.
You do not want to end your day early 
with a trip to the hospital.

Ten years later, “fetch” still isn’t 
happening. But a “Mean Girls” re-
union may.
Lindsay Lohan 
announced last week that screen-writer Tina Fey is planning a get-to-gether of the 2004 cast.
“I saw Tina, 
and she mentioned maybe doing some sort of reunion,” Lohan said on NBC’s Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on March 6. 
The 10-year anniversary of the 
satirical high-school comedy ar-rives April 30, but no official re-union date has been confirmed.
Twenty-year-old UF biology 
sophomore Adithi Vemuri has lost count of the times she’s seen “Mean 
Girls.” 
“I think it’s awesome, because I 
love all of them,” she said. 
Vemuri awaits the reunion with 
feelings of nostalgia and excite-ment.
“Everyone from our generation 
can quote it and knows what you’re 
talking about when you reference 
it,” she said.
Second-year UF law student John 
Kelly, 23, saw the film and became 
so engrossed that he completely 
forgot he had to go to work.
“I had made fun of people for 
watching it, ‘cause that’s what you do,” he said. 
But he decided to try it out once 
before his shift at Publix.
“I don’t know if I loved it, but I 
couldn’t turn it off,” he said.
When his brother got home, Kel-
ly realized he was half an hour late for work.
Although he didn’t suffer any 
major repercussions from his boss, Kelly said he was made fun of at 
work for the incident.
Kelly said he will probably 
watch the reunion when it happens, but not before he has to work.Shut up!

After months of anticipation, 
The Fray has released its newest ef-
fort “Helios” on Epic Records.
“Helios” marks The Fray’s 
fourth full-length album, one in 
which the band experiments with 
numerous genres and sounds, but fails to create a cohesive vision.Known for its emotive lyrics and 
arena-rock style, The Fray opts for pursuing disco, blues and down-tempo styles for this album. 
“Hold My Hand” kicks it off 
with a distinctly raw sound from vocalist Isaac Slade, complement-
ed by desperate lyrics and soulful 
choir backing. “Love Don’t Die” channels The Black Keys and The White Stripes for a boot-stomping blues anthem. 
Other songs delve into surpris-
ing genres, notably “Give It Away” with its Nile Rodgers-esque guitar chords and a funky hook not too far removed from ‘70s disco classics.
The middle of the album re-
turns to The Fray’s traditional, pop-alternative style with songs such as “Hurricane,” providing uplift-ing, love-stricken lyrics and funky basslines. “Our Last Days” will register familiarly with dedicated listeners for its cheery piano keys and Slade’s hopeful crooning. 
The end of the album emphasiz-
es delightfully nuanced guitar play-ing, best seen in the crisp chords of 
“Shadow and a Dancer.”
Though the band can be ap-
plauded for pushing boundaries 
and deviating from its beloved style, the album ultimately fails in uniting its many divided pieces. Although songs like “Break Your Plans” tease low-key ballads, the choruses usually play it safe and stick to characteristically catchy yet vapid songwriting.
 Fans will enjoy the effort but 
perhaps crave a bit more experi-mentation and fulﬁ  llment for The Fray’s next album.

world, South African band KON-GOS has released the appropriately-titled “Lunatic.” 
Comprised of the four sons of 
South African singer John Kongos, KONGOS’ sophomore album show-cases the harsh yet engaging style of the band through deliciously dark lyrics and unconventional song structures. 
The album takes the best of al-
ternative music and turns it on its head to create a diverse yet electrify-
ing album. “Come With Me Now,” 
the album’s lead single, combines a rocking beat, a rollicking accordion and vulgar lyrics — lead singer Dylan Kongos croons, “I tried to sell my soul last night, funny, he wouldn’t even take a bite” — in excellent fashion. 
A refreshing, soul-
ful breakdown and pulsing guitar 
solo add variety to the track and en-sure the song never loses its spark.Many of the lyrics found in the 
album speak directly to the 18-to-25 age group. “Kids These Days” recalls the rebellion and apathy of youth as each generation falls into the trap of war. “Sex on the Radio” considers the effect of the media on 
our culture and how our expecta-
tions often come short. 
Equipped with a barrage of ex-
pertly composed instrumentals and haunting yet poignant lyrics, KON-GOS makes no sacriﬁ  ces in deliver-ing its unique sound. Perhaps the most commendable aspect is the band’s ability to weave its South African inﬂ  uences in a traditionally American genre. Although some 
may ﬁ  nd the album too harsh for 
casual listening, “Lunatic” marks a well-balanced work from this up-and-coming band.
KONGOS album lives up to expectations with unconventional style

Send a question to letmegatoraidyou.tumblr.com.“My boyfriend and I have been doing the pull-out method for over a year now,  
and I haven’t gotten pregnant. Is birth control really worth the money?”
— Anonymous
I’ve been participating in the act for more than six years, and I still worry about the PO method. I don’t know how you do it, but props, bro. My advice? Safe sex is ALWAYS worth 
it. Just because you’ve been insanely lucky thus far doesn’t mean the next time you have sex won’t f*** up your entire life. Pun absolutely intended. Whether it’s condoms, pills, an IUD or the shot, they all provide more protection than the method you’re currently using. Also keep in mind, yeah, you’re not pregnant, but that doesn’t mean you’re set in the vagina department. The clap is a very real thing. I know the pull-out method feels so much better than using condoms, but try to think of the consequences of it next time clothes start flying off. If you’re not into condoms, at least protect yourself with one of the other types of contraception. Those little blue pills could prevent you from popping 
out a smaller version of the loser guy on top of you, so they’re totally worth it.GatorAidreviewsTHURSDAY, MARCH 13, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

ERIN MEISENZAHL-PEACE
Avenue Writer
“That’s why her hair’s so big,” 
said Janis Ian in “Mean Girls.”  
“It’s full of secrets.”
According to a recent study, 
Gretchen Wieners’ hair isn’t the only thing affected by her repres-sion from confession. By keep-
ing her secrets pent up, Wieners 
could have also increased her chances of chronic or long-term illness, not to mention emotional instability. 
In a 2013 study, University 
of California, Berkeley associate professor Clayton R. Critcher and Cornell University associate pro-
fessor Melissa J. Ferguson found 
that participants who were asked to conceal a secret showed deﬁ  -cits in intellectual activity and physical stamina. 
The repression is associated 
with higher stress levels, which 
have been shown to cause detri-
mental long-term effects on phys-ical health in otherwise healthy individuals.
Wieners should have shared 
her conﬁ  dential information in order to relieve some of the stress she put on her body, according to the study.
But what if she didn’t feel 
comfortable sharing her secrets with anyone she knows?
That’s where anonymous se-
cret-sharing apps such as Whis-
per have carved out their market. 
“My secret: My little always forces me to drink against my 
will,” wrote one user on the app, a mobile social network that al-lows users to post anonymous 
confessions and geotag their lo-
cations. 
Although Whisper users gen-
erally post less serious confes-sions — e.g., “Fell off a canoe at 
Lake Wauburg” — those who 
write to sites like PostSecret tend to send in more conﬁ  dential con-fessions.
Smaller secrets may not in-
duce as much nervous tension. However, emotionally charged ones that have to do with trau-ma, closeted sexual orientation 
or inﬁ  delity cause stress and can harm long-term health, according 
to four studies published in the American Psychological Associa-tion’s 2012 edition of the Journal 
of Experimental Psychology: 
General.
“Secrets weigh people down,” 
a brief of the studies reported. “People who recalled, were pre-
occupied with, or suppressed an 
important secret estimated hills to be steeper, perceived distances to be farther, indicated that phys-
ical tasks would require more ef-
fort, and were less likely to help others with physical tasks.”
Meg Konigsburg, a 22-year-
old UF advertising senior, said 
she feels that weight.
“I would deﬁ  nitely say there’s a level of stress in keeping a se-
cret,” Konigsburg said. “There’s a lot more anxiety.”
She said she’s currently sup-
pressing the urge to share pri-vate information about someone because she wants to be a good friend. 
Because Konigsburg’s lips are 
sealed, her friend didn’t have to turn to sites like PostSecret or Whisper to relieve stress but turned to her instead. 
She said it isn’t worth it for her 
to reveal her friend’s secret, but she understands why people do. 
Telling someone or posting 
about your secret can be very ca-
thartic, Konigsburg said.

Debose granted sixth year
The NCAA has granted Gators wide receiver Andre Debose a sixth year of 
eligibility, UF announced Wednesday. After missing the 2013 season with a torn ACL, Debose will be cleared for noncontact practice on March 28.Gators in the NBA

EIGHTH INNING.
ADAM PINCUS
Alligator Staff Writer @adamDpincus
The Gators erased any doubt they would 
have to play their fourth straight extra-in-
ning game in a big way Wednesday night.
Florida (11-6), which used 11 pitchers last 
weekend, drove in seven eighth-inning runs en route to a 13-5 victory against Illinois State (9-5) at McKethan Stadium. The Gators’ 13 
runs were a season high. They doubled their 
home-run output to four. They sent 13 bat-ters to the plate in the inning.
Casey Turgeon hit a grand slam off Jack 
Czeszewski, who had the forgettable stat 
line of seven earned runs in a third of an in-
ning. Florida entered the frame with a 6-5 lead only to blow the game wide open off a depleted Illinois State pitching staff that had 
completed a three-game tournament in Win-
ter Haven the night before.
“I didn’t think I hit it really well, but you 
never knew what those flags are doing. It was blowing pretty hard,” Turgeon said. 
“We answered really well. We’re going in 
the right track.”
Until the eighth, Florida’s early offense 
in the third inning looked like it would be 
enough. Nursing a one-run lead off a passed ball, third-base coach Craig Bell dialed up a 
double steal to advance Richie Martin and 
Turgeon to third and second. 
Taylor Gushue did the rest, hooking a 
fastball just inside the right-field line for a 
bases-clearing double.
Florida chased Illinois State starter J.D. 
Learnard after three innings. Right-hander Matt Lambert didn’t fare any better, allow-ing three runs in the fifth. Martin reached on a fielding error by shortstop Dennis Colon 
to lead off the inning. With Turgeon batting, 
he swiped second for his team-leading sixth stolen base of 2014.
Freshman Peter Alonso drove Martin in 
on a grounder that went under Stewart’s 
glove before Braden Mattson reached the 
last row of metal bleachers in left-center. The blast gave Florida a five-run lead and marked the first home run by a Florida play-
er not named Taylor Gushue.
“That one was good,” Mattson said. 
“Thank God it was windy.”
Illinois State scored its first run on 
Wednesday on a bloop single into left field off Danny Young. The Redbirds added four 
more in the eighth on two walks and five singles against five different relievers. Both teams couldn’t seem to register an out in an 
inning that never wanted to end.

SOFTBALL
JORDAN MCPHERSON
Alligator Writer @J_McPherson1126
Chelsea Herndon showed why 
she deserved to be in the Gators’ 
starting lineup on Wednesday.
After Florida shut out Mercer 
in the first game of its double-
header with an 8-0 five-inning 
win, Game 2 of the day had much less offense.
Both teams were scoreless 
heading into the bottom of the seventh inning, and Florida had only two hits through the first six frames — a stark contrast from the 10 hits the team plated in five 
innings to start off the day.
Hoping to avoid extra innings 
after already playing three-and-
a-half hours of softball, Herndon provided a spark for the Gators, hitting a leadoff triple to put her-self 60 feet away from winning 
the game. 
Florida drew three straight 
walks after Herndon’s play to 
take a 1-0 win.
“I wasn’t really trying to hit a 
home run or anything,” she said. “I was just trying to get on base to spark the team with Lauren Haeger coming up next.”
Herndon started at second 
base in both contests against the 
Bears (17-9, 2-1 Atlantic Sun) af-
ter previously starting only six games for the No. 1 Gators (26-1, 2-1 Southeastern Conference).
After starting five games in 
the outfield, Herndon had to cor-rect her play to keep up with the pace of playing in the infield.
“(The game) moves much 
quicker in the infield,” Herndon said. “There are more pop flies in the outfield. I’m just learning to adjust, giving it all I got every day. I’m willing to go wherever the team needs me.”
Added coach Tim Walton: 
“She’s a natural infielder. She’s not really an outfielder, so to get 
her a lot more reps in the infield 
now is probably a lot more com-fortable for her, but the game is slowing down for her.”
After going 2 for 5 at the plate 
and scoring two of Florida’s nine runs on Wednesday, Herndon is now batting .357 on the season and has scored 11 runs.
“The reason she’s playing is because she’s making things hap-pen,” Walton said. 
“She’s been fun to watch. We 
got a lot more at-bats at the top of the lineup and she’s really doing a good job.”
Florida’s two games against 
Mercer were complete opposites. 
In Game 1, the Gators had eight 
different players with at least one hit and six of them scored.
But after the 30-minute break 
between games ceased, that of-fensive production looked non-existent, with Florida’s batting average dropping from .455 to .150.
Walton said playing a nail-bit-
er like the second game against a non-conference team in Mer-cer will only help the team as it 
moves along with its SEC slate.
“There’s nothing like hav-
ing at-bats with a 0-0 ballgame,” 
Walton said. 
“There’s nothing like playing 
defense in a 0-0 ballgame. Same with pitching. It really prepares you.”

There will be no divers 
representing the Gators at this 
year’s swimming and diving NCAA Championships.
All five of Florida’s com-
petitors failed to qualify at the three-day Zone Diving Re-gional Championships, which concluded on Wednesday in Greensboro, N.C. 
But Florida will still be repre-
sented well at the national meet by the country’s top-ranked men’s team, which qualified 14 
swimmers and all five relays.
The No. 8 women’s squad, 
which fielded the same number 
of swimmers, will also compete in all five NCAA relays.
“I’m proud of the efforts that 
it took for them to get there,” coach Gregg Troy said.It wasn’t a lack of effort that 
prevented the Gators from qualifying a single diver.
Sophomore Kahlia Warner 
posted a career best in the plat-form prelims on Wednesday with her score of 284.10. But she scored nearly 30 points fewer in the finals, leaving her in sixth place and ending her season.
Warner made the finals in 
all three events at regionals.
Neither of Florida’s men 
reached the finals on Day 3, but sophomore Zach Hernan-dez came one spot away from advancing with one of his best performances of the season by scoring a 271.90 on the platform. Redshirt senior Chris Jones did not compete on the final day af-
ter making the 1-meter spring-
board finals the previous day — the only finals appearance for the men’s team.UF divers fail to

 SEE BASE, p AgE 15
SEE SOFTBALL, p AgE 15Snead, Ryan Harris and Bobby Poyner — faced the bases loaded 
before right-hander Eric Hanhold stopped the hemorrhaging.
“I guess if there is only one negative in the game, I don’t 
think we pitched very well in the eighth there,” O’Sullivan said. “We made it very interesting, but our bullpen has been really good the whole year and we responded with seven in the bot-tom of the eighth.”
Florida’s offense gave freshman Brett Morales early run sup-
port to work with. After starting the season as the No. 2 starter, the right-hander surrendered four-earned runs in a five-batter relief appearance his last time out on Feb. 28.
Morales showed poise, escaping a fourth-inning, bases-load-
ed jam in his third collegiate start. 
He hit Mason Snyder to load the bases before punching out 
No. 8 batter Brock Stewart on an outside fastball to end the in-ning. Four of his career-high five strikeouts came immediately after allowing a baserunner.
The Tampa native followed up the stellar starting pitching 
that carried Florida to a series sweep of Connecticut with 4.1 innings of one-run ball.
“I thought Brett’s start was really good. Definitely a step in 
the right direction and more of what we saw in the preseason,” 
O’Sullivan said.
Florida won its fifth-straight game for the first time since 
completing its home sweep of then-No.8 South Carolina on 
April 13, 2013. 
The Gators wound up winning eight in a row before going 
on a late-season swoon that saw them lose 12 of their final 19 games.
They start Southeastern Conference play on Friday in a 
three-game home series against Arkansas. They’ll be coming off 
a game where they knocked in 13 runs on 12 hits. 
Mattson wasn’t shy when asked whether the pop Florida 
showed is something to be expected.
“No doubt.”EDEN OTERO

Beating a team 17-3 in the first half is not 
winning — it’s complete dominance.
On Tuesday, the No. 4 Gators (8-1, 1-0 
American Lacrosse Conference) not only 
beat Winthrop (2-4) 21-5, they outshot, out-numbered and outsmarted the Eagles in ev-ery way.
In the first half alone, UF had 11 players 
score. It’s almost become habitual for the Florida lacrosse team to have more than five scorers in a game and to finish with a blow-out win. 
The juniors and seniors left on the team 
will be the first to tell you that its new sys-tem of scoring is a big reason for Florida’s success.
Coach Amanda O’Leary has preached 
that playing as a unit is what makes this young team so much different from its pre-decessor.
However, it wasn’t just Florida’s scoring 
that allowed them to dominate the Win-throp, but the Gators’ ability to win draw controls (20-8), ground balls (14-9) and free-position shots (7-8 to 0-1) that put the final 
nail in the coffin.
Florida also used Winthrop’s slow and 
sloppy back-zone coverage to its advantage. 
With junior Shannon Gilroy outrunning ev-ery midfielder and defender who got in her 
way, and freshman Mollie Stevens sweeping 
balls under the Eagles goalkeepers feet, the Gators’ offense was unstoppable.
“If someone’s having a bad day, then 
someone else is having a good day and we can count on everyone on the team,” Gilroy said.
Florida got off to an early start, scoring the 
first point of the game just 25 seconds after 
the first draw control. However, the Eagles 
countered and held the game tied. But with Winthrop committing multiple fouls within just 10 minutes of the first half, Florida was 
able to put nine points on the board — five 
of which came from free-position shots.
“We practice 8-meters everyday at prac-
tice,” freshman Sammi Burgess said. “I think we dealt with it pretty well. … I think we 
handled the physicality just because our de-
fense is really physical in practice. Like hon-estly, I don’t think I’ll ever play a defense better than ours.”
Florida went into its matchup against 
Winthrop focusing on the backer defense that the Eagles would be throwing at it. But the Gators’ speed and constant focus on the defense in practice made Winthrop’s effort 
ineffective.
 “Our offense was based on getting the 
ball around and finding that backside,” Gil-roy said. “We put many different people on that backside to get the goal.” 
With a win against Winthrop in the books, No. 4 Florida will head to No. 3 Syracuse to face off in a top-five matchup on Saturday 
at noon.

Rogers (10-1) gave up two hits

scoreless innings in the second game, extending her streak of scoreless innings pitched to 27. The freshman left-hander notched nine strikeouts, bringing her total to 66 on the year, and dropped her ERA to a 1.17.
“Delanie got her strikeouts 
when she needed to and showed some good poise,” Walton said. “And Hannah did the same thing. We had some opportunities in the first game to let our guard down and give up runs.
“I thought Hannah stepped 
up and made her pitches. Delanie did the same in the second game, throwing her riseball really well, getting some good strikes early in 
the count, but I thought they both 
pitched really well today.”16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, MARCH 13, 2014
