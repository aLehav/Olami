96/78Florida great-grandma takes a bite out of crime 
DAYTONA BEACH (AP) — A great-grandmother in Daytona 
Beach bit an assailant and was dragged several feet hanging on 
to the car of a couple who snatched her purse. Patricia Robertson doesn’t know how she summoned the strength, but the commotion she created helped get her belongings back.
Police said the 73-year-old was accosted at a gas station by a 
man and woman who grabbed her purse. Robertson said she bit the man hard enough to draw blood and hung on to their truck when that failed. A bystander called 911 and followed the assailants until police could catch the couple. Robertson said she’s sore and almost lost a tooth, but thankful for the good Samaritan’s help.

A Gainesville woman just couldn’t re-
sist the divine order to take a dip in Bernie 
Machen’s pool. 
At 10:45 p.m. Monday, staff members at 
the UF President’s House called police and 
reported a woman trespassing and swim-
ming in the pool, according to Capt. Jeff Holcomb, public information officer for the University  Police Department. This is not the first time trespassers 
have attempted to swim in the President’s House pool, Holcomb said. 
The officers who found the woman, 
who was noticeably disoriented, thought 
she was drunk. 
As it turns out, the woman was not 
drunk. 
While officers talked with the woman, 
according to Holcomb, she told them that God told her to get in the pool. 
After officers apprehended and spoke with her, the woman invoked the Baker 
Act. Under the Baker Act, 
patients are taken to men-tal health facilities, where they are observed for a 
maximum of three days.
Officers took the 
woman to Shands, where 
she was presumably as-sessed, and then taken to 
Shands Vista, one of two local Baker Act facilities.Before leaving, officers gave her a tres-
pass warning, which means she could be arrested if she returns to UF campus.
Because of the Health Insurance Porta-
bility and Accountability Act restrictions, 
her name cannot be released.
UF president Bernie Machen moved out 
of the President’s House and into a private 
residence in 2006.

Graffiti isn’t a black-and-white 
issue.
Its legality, artistic merit and 
permanence are debated. But in 
Gainesville, it’s still vandalism.
On July 21, it took Chris Arters, 
a Physical Plant Division employee, about 30 minutes to clean graffiti off the potato-shaped rock in Tur-lington Plaza, according to Wayne Wainwright, UF facilities depart-ment manager.
According to Wainwright, graf-fiti shows up every week on campus during the summer. During during the fall, it’s every few days.
Sometimes, it takes a whole day 
to remove the graffiti.
The Southwest 34th Street wall, 
the 13th Street pedestrian tunnel 
and Turlington Plaza are three of Gaines-ville’s biggest graffiti 
hot spots.
While technically illegal, no one 
has been arrested for vandalizing 
any of those three places in recent months.
About once or twice a year, stu-dents are disciplined for graffiti, said Capt. Jeff Holcomb of the University Police Department.
The wall on 34th Street is owned 
by the Florida Department of Trans-portation, and it is illegal to create graffiti there, according to Gina Busscher, a department spokes-woman.
“We don’t have enforcement 
powers,” she said. “We rely on lo-cal police, and it has not, in the past, been a high priority for the police to enforce the vandalism.”

� JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES ARE HOLDING A 
CONVENTION AT THE O’CONNELL CENTER.

Alligator Contributing Writer
You may have seen the banners hanging over Univer-
sity Avenue and 13th Street.
The Jehovah’s Witnesses are knocking on Gainesville’s 
door this weekend.
From Friday through Sunday, Jehovah’s Witnesses will 
be walking through the doors of the O’Connell Center, 
where they will hold their second weekend-long conven-
tion of the summer.
Their last conference, held over Independence Day 
weekend, filled about 6,000 seats in the O’Connell Center 
on each of its three days, according to Tony Fowler, a con-
vention spokesman.
Attendees will be coming from Florida, Georgia and 
Alabama, according to O’Connell Center assistant direc-
tor David Lucier.
The conventions are for the purpose of Bible instruc-
tion, and there will be a number of speakers and interac-tive presentations with a focused message, Fowler said.
The verse they will be focusing on is James 4:8, which 
reads in the New World Translation, “Draw close to God, 
and he will draw closer to you.”
During the speeches, there will be skits, demonstra-
tions and staged interviews with people relating their 
personal experiences, he said.Religious group

National Minority Donor 
Awareness DaySundayOrgan, tissue and eye dona-tion is important to everyone but can sometimes be of even greater concern to the minor-

way to get more natural gas 
out of the ground---a hydrau-lic drilling process called hy-draulic fracturing, or “fracking” for short. Energy companies across rural America are attempting to lease property from residents in order to drill for natural 
gas.
Filmmaker Josh Fox received a lucrative offer from an ener-gy company wanting to lease his property to tap into a res-ervoir of natural gas. Fox decided to take his cam-era and meet other rural resi-dents on the front lines of fracking. He traveled to 32 states and discovered toxic streams, ruined acquifers, dy-
ing livestock, brutal illnesses, 
and kitchen sinks that burst into flames. He learns that all water is connected and per-haps some things are more valuable than money.

minorities are much more 
likely than Caucasians to need life-saving transplants. More than 100,000 men, women and children in the United States are waiting for a life-saving organ, and half of those on the waiting list are minority patients.
While race is not a limiting 
determinant in donations, transplant success rates increase when organs are matched between members of the same ethnic and racial group.  Lower donation rates among minorities can result in longer waiting periods for 
transplants for minority or-
gan recipients.One out of 20 Americans will need a tissue transplant in his or her lifetime. Donated tissues such as skin, bone and heart valves are used to treat burn victims, increase strength, restore mobility 
and improve the quality of 
life for approximately 1 mil-lion patients each year. Tissue is a special gift that can be shared among all populations. A minority do-nor’s tissue may benefit a patient of another race, and a minority patient may re-
ceive tissue from a donor of 
another race.The commitment to donate tissue is part of the focus during National Minority Donor Awareness Day, ob-served August 1 each year to raise awareness of the im-portance of donation among 
minority populations.

Normally, Florida athletes fight team-
mates for playing time, but on Friday, they’ll 
compete for six worthy causes.
Members of the 2010 football squad will 
challenge each other in a series of strength competitions at the third annual Gator Char-
ity Challenge at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on 
Friday as part of their last workout of the summer. 
The squad will be divided into six teams 
that will represent six Shands-affiliated or-ganizations. This year, the event will feature 
the Ronald McDonald House Charities of 
North Central Florida, Shands Cancer Hos-pital, STOP! Children’s Cancer, the Ameri-
can Cancer Society, American Heart As-
sociation and March of Dimes, said Kari Hodgkiss, a representative of the University 
Athletic Association.
There are 19 players on each team, 
said Scott Holsopple, assistant director of strength conditioning. Each team member was chosen by Holsopple and Mickey Ma-
rotti, the Gators’ strength and conditioning coordinator.
“We chose the teams based on their char-
acter and skill,” Holsopple said.
The six squads will be led by Ahmad 
Black, Brandon Antwine, Lorenzo Edwards, 
A.J. Jones, Terron Sanders 
and Duke Lemmens in 
the night’s contests, which 
consist of a sled push, ob-stacle course, farmer’s 
hold and tug of war.
Pledge cards will be 
available at the West Con-course for fans to donate 
to the six causes, said Denver Parler, assis-
tant director of communications of UAA.  
No cash or checks will be accepted.
About $11,000 was raised last year, but 
increasing awareness is the ultimate goal, Hodgkiss said. 
The challenge is free to the public and 
will begin with team introductions at 7 p.m.Athletes to compete in

A man was robbed at gunpoint while 
he was taking out the trash at his job 
early Monday morning, and the robber 
is still on the loose.
The employee, who works at Art of 
Billiards on 4251 SW 13th St., was be-
hind the store washing kitchen mats and throwing out the garbage when he noticed someone approaching from Wil-liston Road, said Alachua County Sher-iff’s Office spokesman Art Forgey.
At first, the man made small talk with 
the employee, even asking if Art of Bil-liards was hiring, Forgey said.
“He said he was feeling kind of un-
comfortable because the man was hold-ing his hands behind his back,” Forgey said.
As the conversation ended, the man showed his hands and pointed a black handgun at the employee, forcing him toward the back of the building, Forgey said.
He ordered the employee onto his 
knees and demanded he empty his pock-ets. The employee took out his wallet and whatever bills he had, Forgey said.
The robber then took the bills out 
of the wallet, threw the wallet back at the employee and ran east toward the 
woods, Forgey said.
The employee was not 
otherwise injured, Forgey said.
The suspect is described as a black 
man in his mid-20s, about 6’1” and of slim, but muscular build, he said.
Anyone with information is asked to 
call 352-955-1818, or to make an anony-mous tip with Crime Stoppers at 352-372-7867 for a reward of up to $1,000.Pool hall employee

Former UF quarterback Tim Tebow shakes hands with Jockey president and chief operating 
officer Ed Emma. Tebow has signed on to be a spokesman for Jockey.
TEBOW UPDATE
By RACHAEL PINO
Alligator Staff Writer
Tim Tebow prefers briefs.
The former Florida Heisman winner 
and Denver Broncos draft pick signed a 
multi-year contract with Jockey Interna-tional Inc. on Tuesday.
“Tim is a highly gifted athlete with a 
positive attitude and an admirable char-
acter,” said Debra S. Waller, Jockey chair-
woman and CEO, in a corporate press release.  “We at Jockey see a very bright 
future with Tim, and believe that he is an 
excellent representative for the brand.”
Tebow’s image, sporting a Jockey 
white T-shirt, already appears on the company’s website, announcing the part-nership by referring to the athlete as its 
No.1 draft pick.
“Tim is genuine, smart and driven and 
those qualities align well with Jockey,” Waller continued. “We look forward to building a long and collaborative rela-
tionship with him in the coming years.” 
As spokesman, Tebow will work with 
several Jockey lines, including the spring Staycool collection. He will appear in the company’s catalog, TV and print ads and 
on the company’s website at www.jock-
ey.com.
“I’m excited to represent the Jockey 
brand and to work with such an innova-tive company,” Tebow said in the release. “I’ve long been a fan and consumer of 
Jockey, and think they make a quality 
product with a great fit. I’m looking for-ward to a great relationship with such a 
respectable company.” Tebow signs undie deal
On Saturday, there will also be a 
baptism ceremony, he said.
“There’s a focus on ways of 
strengthening one’s attachment to 
God and being able to see how we can strengthen our spirituality; to really handle the challenges and 
stresses we have to face,” he said. 
The highlight of the weekend 
will be on Sunday, when perform-
ers will put on a full-costume drama that will portray an account from 
the destruction of Jerusalem in the first century. 
“It’s all going to revolve around 
a variety of Bible topics and Bible 
subjects really designed to edify one’s spirituality,” he said.
Those on campus this weekend 
should watch out for parking be-cause, as Lucier said, parking has been a problem in the past. 
Between May and September of 
this year, Jehovah’s Witnesses are holding about 357 conventions in 90 cities across the U.S.
Conventions have been held at 
UF for about six years now, Lucier 
said. Parking could be a problem

NewsLocal� THE RACE IS A CLASS PROJECT.
By KAT BEIN
Alligator Writer
More than 2,000 years ago, Romans raced 
wooden chariots around the track at Circus 
Maximus for sport. 
Friday, at the Reitz Union Ballroom, the past 
will be resurrected, albeit on a smaller scale — and with robots.
Starting at 2 p.m., 120 engineering fresh-
men, grouped in 30 teams of four or five, will race shoe-box sized chariots made of LEGOs they’ve been building and programming as part of AGN 1935, an introduction course giv-
en over summer.
While the performance of the robots will not 
be part of the final grade, there will be a prize 
for the winner, as well as small door prizes for each bracket winner and superlatives like best design, said Dan Dickrell of the UF department of mechanical and aerospace engineering.
They will, however, be graded on a written 
summary about the building and program-ming process, and the things they learned.
“We want it to be fun, but we also want 
them to take it seriously,” Dickrell said.
In the past, the class has always ended with 
a building assignment, but “nothing to this magnitude of coolness,” he said.
According to Dickrell, it’s in 
the rules that chariots must be topped with a LEGO man, and if he gets knocked off, just as in 
real chariot races, he’s dead, and the team is disqualified.
J. T. Anderson, a chemical engineering ma-
jor, has spent about 10 hours on his chariot.
“This has kind of showed us that engineers 
are faced with a problem, and you need to fig-ure out the best way to solve it,” he said. “It’s a lot of work but a lot of fun at the same time.”Engineers race robot chariots“I’m excited to represent the

tion understands that police officers focus 
on issues that are more serious, she said. 
Gainesville Police Department spokes-
woman Cpl. Tscharna Senn said she doesn’t think anyone has ever been arrest-
ed for vandalizing the wall.
The wall serves as a “community bul-
letin board,” said Richard Heipp, interim 
director of the School of Art and Art His-tory at UF.
Mickie MacKenzie, executive director 
of Keep Alachua County Beautiful, said the organization tries to paint over obscenities. Graffiti, she said, is usually an eyesore and 
a symbol of crime.
The pedestrian tunnel under 13th Street 
mostly serves as an artistic outlet for stu-
dents, and it differs from more vulgar graf-fiti found elsewhere, Holcomb said.
“It’s not even good tagging,” he said.But Holcomb said there’s some good 
art on the 34th Street wall, including the memorial to the five UF students mur-
dered in the fall of 1990.
Adam Tritt, a 45-year-old writer and 
therapist in Palm Bay, painted the memo-
rial in September 1990.
“I knew the community was suffering, 
and I did something about it,” Tritt said.
But he said it’s “stark-raving crazy” that 
the memorial is still around 20 years later.“It was going to be extremely tempo-
rary because that’s the nature of the wall, which is why that center panel ruins the concept of the wall.”
Alachua County Sheriff Sadie Darnell, 
then a Gainesville Police captain, main-tained the wall until 2000. Now, UF’s Inter-fraternity Council maintains the memorial, said Sean Smith, the council’s president.
For graffiti artists, Gainesville’s not the 
best place to tag, one artist said. The graffiti artist, who goes by “Brown,” started learn-ing graffiti at the wall on 34th Street about three years ago.
He said it’s frustrating that what he 
paints on the wall gets painted over. Gen-
erally, he said, it costs him about $15 for each piece he paints. He said many peo-
ple have a misconception 
that graffiti crews are the same as gangs 
because of gang tags, but he said the gang tags aren’t true graffiti because they mostly 
just mark territory.
But the Norman Tunnel offers first-
time graffiti artists an opportunity to ex-
periment.
Tuesday night, three high school se-
niors who are at UF for a summer science camp spray painted their first tags.
“It’s something we wanted to leave be-
hind,” he said. “Now we’re a part of his-
tory.”Tunnel, wall popular spots to tag

Ever since Mellow Mushroom closed 
its doors in October, the restaurant 
space less than 500 feet east of the UF 
campus has been vacant.
Not anymore.Nearly a year later, a new tenant will 
occupy the 3,400-square-foot building 
at 1209 W University Ave. when An-
thony’s Wood Fired Pizza opens in mid-August. 
“We know who our customers are,” 
said William Gray, a restaurant man-ager. “We are, 100 percent, a school-oriented restaurant.”
Anthony’s will serve food until 4 
a.m., providing bar patrons a reason-
ably priced, late-night option to “settle 
you down,” Gray said.
Besides pizza, Anthony’s will also 
serve wings, fajitas, lasagna, burgers 
and an array of appetizers including a 
concoction called “Gator Bites.” 
The Gator Bites, with a spicy kick 
from fresh jalapeno peppers, will be the restaurant’s claim to fame, he said. 
“But four or five of them can be dan-
gerous,” he joked. “We might have to have people sign a waiver.”
A full vegetarian menu is also in the 
works, he said.The restaurant will use wood-burn-
ing ovens to cook nearly every item on the menu. It will also serve a variety of imported, local and microbrew beers, he said. 
 “We want as many [beers] as we can 
get our hands on,” he said. 
The restaurant will also feature a 
chalkboard menu with daily specials.
While specific prices have yet to 
be set, Gray said there will not be any $12 burgers like he saw at another Gainesville establishment. 
“What’s up with that?” he asked. 
“Nothing is cheap these days, but it 
doesn’t have to be overpriced either.”
Before Anthony’s signed the lease, 
the property attracted plenty of poten-
tial clients, said Jamie Kennedy, the 
commercial real estate agent who was 
assigned to the lot.
“We could have showed it five or six 
times a week,” Kennedy said. “That’s a pretty hot property.”Pizza joint fills vacancy

Even though he’s left 
UF and the Gators far behind, Tim Tebow is 
still making us proud in Colo-rado.
It’s been a while since 
Tebow got drafted and shipped off to Denver, but in addition to breaking the record for the best-selling rookie jersey of all time, he’s also become the first spokes-person for Jockey we actually care about.
Jockey needed someone 
to help them sell plain white T’s, and we can’t think of any-one plainer and whiter than Tebow.
 Watch out Michael Jordan, 
you’ve got the most competi-tive guy in the world working to make sure he sells more 
underwear and plain white 
T’s than you.We had given up on think-
ing major companies could get someone halfway respect-able to market their products, let alone someone who is still 
relevant.

Prince says Internet is no 
longer profitable
Summer is coming to a close, and it’s time for us to dole out an award for the most out-of-context quote of the se-mester: Prince’s now-famous uttering of “the Internet is 
over.”
Similar to when Al Gore said he invented the Internet, not a 
moment went by before people came out of the woodwork to jump on the music icon for what they perceived as ignorance. A quick read past the headlines, though, reveals his actual mes-sage — the Internet is over as a viable way to distribute and profit from music.
Even though we couldn’t agree more, there are bound to 
be some skeptics out there — probably the same crowd who seems to forget that the mastermind behind “Purple Rain” predicted the fall of the major-label system and pretty much 
invented texting acronyms.
The greatest music of the past 50 years has come in the 
form of albums: Dylan’s “Highway 61 Revisted,” The Beatles’ 
eponymous white album, “Thriller.”  Not one of them made their mark by selling their individual songs online for 99 cents a pop.
Albums cost a lot of money and, as Prince pointed out, sites 
like iTunes are not in the business of doling out advances. And forget record labels. The way they’re struggling to survive isn’t 
conducive to funding multi-million dollar magnum opi by big 
acts.
We can blame the death of the music industry as we know 
it on any number of things – Napster, Limewire, or even iPods – but the harsh reality is that consumers are to blame. People have become so keen on taking music at face value by down-loading all the hits and trimming off the fat, but that’s not how art should be treated. You have to absorb it, not twist it for your own means. All that does is suppress musicians and keep them 
from taking chances.
So let’s prove Prince right by going against the grain and 
buying albums again. Maybe then our generation could afford 
to commission some more memorable music than Nickelback.
America heralds the banner of innovation because 
of the country’s aptitude for creativity. Individual creativity is an essential part of the American spirit 
and is embodied in our country’s founding documents. A government produces the most from its citizens when it al-lows each of them to define and pursue their own success. Using a system of limited regulation, a government should be one that allows for society to enhance its prospects by working up freely from below, instead of being determined from the top. 
Shortcomings in individual ability to meet standards of 
living due to unfortunate circumstance are alleviated by cit-
izen concern and a desire for philanthropy. Care for the fel-
low man should consist of action encouraged through tax incentives, not entitlement demanded through taxation.
America thrives because our citizens are encouraged to 
think, create and be successful.
While our overall education ranking may not be the 
highest in the world, the gross domestic product of our ideas trumps all else. To the global table, we bring a cap-tivating movie industry, highly desired brands and prod-ucts, and the most revolutionary uses of the Internet.  
All of this innovative success is complemented by a govern-ment designed to allow people to pursue life at their behest, without the hindrance of oppressive authoritarian over-sight. Inherent in our very Declaration of Independence is the idea that our citizens deserve the ability to pursue greatness. 
In the aristocratic society of the past, monarchs and dic-
tators siphoned off the cream of productivity for the ruling class, leaving the peasants with a subsistent existence.
America, avant-garde to establish the concept, has 
proved throughout its relatively short and highly success-ful history that independent creativity, and its pursuit, is an inalienable right. The capacities to problem solve and pursue higher thought and productivity is an unde-niable natural trait of human beings. Separating mankind from the animal kingdom, our capacity for creative thinking allows us to fulfill the basic primitive needs of life that otherwise consume every bit of energy and fo-
cus of mere animals. 
Historically, those societies who have tried to remove 
independent thought from its citizens have failed consis-
tently. Consider large failed regimes, such as communist 
Russia, and monarchies, such as pre-revolutionary France (and the first attempt at a revolutionary France). They held a guiding principle that innovation and creativity is to come 
from the ruling few and not from the masses, which were 
to be either forcefully equalized (as in Russia’s case) or re-
petitively stifled (as in France’s).  Broaden the scope to most large societies throughout history and compare the suc-cesses of the ones with innovative citizenry to the ones with ensnared, government-dependent masses.
We are to be grateful that we live in a society that was 
founded upon the individual’s ability to succeed, not the government’s ability to provide. America’s success is a trib-ute to its freedom.
In the past 100 years, Americans have seen an increas-
ing trend; one that is shifting away from citizens providing for themselves, to instead making them increasingly depen-dent on government. We find ourselves willing to become less reliant on our own efforts and creativity to succeed. What happens when we fully allow the government to be-come the source of our livelihood and creativity?

 Advanced degrees important
  I respectfully disagree with 
Jon Roosenraad’s  column, “UF 
journalism students deserve teachers with experience in 
ﬁ  eld.” Finding a candidate for 
the position of Executive Pro-
ducer/Managing Editor 21st 
Century News Lab, in the Col-lege of Journalism and Commu-
nications, who has an advanced 
degree and professional experi-
ence is both possible and neces-
sary. There are several profes-sors in our college, and other 
‘professional leaning’ colleges 
that have both. Although nei-
ther requirement is a guarantee 
of ﬁ  nding the professor with the perfect ﬁ  t, having both provides 
the students and the communi-
cations community with the po-
tential for maintaining industry 
standards while perpetuating growth. Too often industry ap-plicants, with and without ad-vanced degrees, think that all 
they have to do is go to class 
and tell war stories. I know, I was one of those hires with both 10 years of industry experience and advanced degrees. I learned quickly that students need more than learning the industry’s ap-proach to a problem or situation. When forward thinking is re-quired, as is certainly the case in 
the journalism communications 
industry today, then the best 
candidate is the holder of both professional experience and ad-vanced degrees. Although I am 
not on the selection committee, 
hiring someone with the best 
credentials in both areas is es-sential. I trust the committee and the dean will make the correct 
decision.

  About two weeks ago, I took a trip to Ce-
dar Key with my Counseling in Commu-nity Settings class and our professor, Dr. 
West-Olatunji. Cedar Key is a small town located on the Gulf Coast, about 50 miles southwest of 
Gainesville. Known for its aqua-farming, it is a 
big name in the clamming industry. The purpose of our trip was to talk to members of the Cedar Key community in order to gain a better under-standing of how the oil spill has impacted their lives. As future counselors, we also wanted to learn how our profession could better serve the needs of communities impacted by the oil spill. 
  In taking the time to talk with local residents, I 
learned more about the reality of the oil spill than I could have ever known from simply watching the news and reading the newspaper. In the last three months, media coverage has focused largely on the negative implications of the spill for Flor-ida’s tourism economy. While these reports are certainly not without merit—we’ve all seen the pictures of tar balls washing up onto the shore-lines—it is important to recognize that there are 
beaches in northwest Florida that have not been 
impacted by the oil. Unfortunately, it is the false perception that all northwest Florida beaches are contaminated that has hurt Cedar Key the most. The media have been very instrumental in fuel-ing these false perceptions. Instead, what is need-ed is widespread dissemination to the public that much of the Florida Gulf Coast waters are not only safe to swim in but also a safe source of food. 
  In speaking to the Cedar Key community 
about the oil spill, our class learned an invaluable lesson. Whether you are a counselor or a journal-ist, the ﬁ  rst step in raising awareness and partner-ing with community residents who anticipating a disaster is to take time to have genuine conver-sations with impacted individuals. Our class did not travel to Cedar Key with the intention of con-ducting research or generating a news story; we went to learn about the residents’ collective his-
tory and listen to their individual narratives.
  It is important to recognize that the perceived 
effects of the oil spill are just as dangerous as the 
real effects. In no way am I trying to discount the media’s efforts to engage in responsible journal-ism. I believe the media have the potential to do a lot of good for our local communities. However, when all angles of an issue are not receiving equal attention, it is everyone’s responsibility to call at-
tention to the problem. With only a few weeks 
left of summer before fall classes begin, I urge my fellow Gators to take a trip to the Gulf and visit Cedar Key. It’s beautiful and oil-free.

Civilizations rise and fall, such is the cy -
cle of human history. There are many things 
attributing to the downfall of a civilization, such as disease, wars or societal collapse. However, I realized recently that there will be 
only one thing to bring down modern West-
ern civilization. Dear readers, I have seen the harbinger of the end of time, and it exists among us in startling quantity. Of course, I refer to Four Loko.
Four Loko, as you may or may not know, 
is an alcoholic beverage masquerading as crappy soda. The idea behind it isn’t new or revolutionary: frat boys have been mixing 
booze with soda since Coca-Cola was invent-
ed. 
But  Four Loko isn’t just any carbonated 
alcoholic beverage with added caffeine. Un-like the 5-6 percent ABV of beer, Four Loko 
weighs in at a liver-quivering 12 percent ABV 
(“The Liver Quiverer” would probably be an awesome drink name). It isn’t so much a drink as it is an elixir, very much like the one 
that transformed the quiet Dr. Jekyll into the 
violent Mr. Hyde (if Mr. Hyde spent 35 percent of his time vomiting). The minds behind this drink used to be those kids with appetites for 
destruction: the ones who would load up toy 
trains with M-80s and send them careening at one another until they collide with a pile of lizards and more explosives (Note: I never did that when I was a kid. Although I kind of 
wish I had now.)
There is no other excuse for drinking Four 
Loko than “I want to risk 
my well-being without even 
remembering it.” There is 
nothing pleasurable about the taste of Four Loko. How -
ever, that won’t stop people from discussing what their 
favorite flavor is. It’s really a process of elimi-
nation: someone’s “favorite” flavor is the 
only one they can even stand to drink.
Four Loko’s awful taste is the only thing 
keeping it from destroying the world as we 
know it. What if they can make it taste bet-ter? I shudder to consider the possibility. If they could make Four Loko taste like Dr. Pep-
per (heck, even Diet Dr. Pepper), I’d be on the streets within a week. This column would be less about me trying to be funny, and more 
about how I really want some pizza, and 
yeah, we should get Five Star and oh man, you guys are my best friends HEY WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT SCREW YOU MAN I’LL BEAT YOUR-[vomits] oh god I’m so sorry you’re my 
best friend [coma].
Dear readers, I’ve done all I can to warn 
you of the threat that lurks in the refrigera-
tors of gas stations and convenience stores 
all over the country. 
Unfortunately, there’s not much any of 
us can do. Four Loko, as we know it, is just 
the beginning. There will always be someone loading up their toy trains with more explo -
sives, sending them ever faster toward a fi-
ery catastrophe. There will be stronger, bet-
ter tasting caffeinated alcoholic beverages in the future, and we will be powerless to resist.
At least it’s cheap.Four Horsemen? No, the Four Loko is the apocalypsepage 11Greenland is Melting is a three piece folk band born and bred in Gainesville. It consists of a stand-up bass, a banjo, an electric

Caffeinated alcoholic beverage is this year’s mind eraserFour Loko Fast Facts
� The drink was developed by three 
alumni of The Ohio State University. 
� The name of the beverage comes from 
ifour of its main ingredients, caffeine, 
taurine, guarana and wormwood, which 
is an active ingredient in absinthe.
� Four Loko contains 12.0 percent ABV. 
A regular domestic contains 5.0 to 6.0.
� A 23.5 ounce can of Four Loko is es-
timated to contain 660 calories. Accord-
ing to McDonald’s, a Big Mac sandwich 
contains 540 calories.
� Four Loko is available in seven re-
splendent flavors that would make The Kool-Aid man jealous: fruit punch, 
orange blend, grape, watermelon, blue 
raspberry, lemonade and cranberry 
lemonade.

‘Inception’: It’s not as imaginative as you think it is
By JUSTIN PLEMMONS
avenue contributing writer
When “Inception” came out, the 
general populace joined together in 
solidarity and screamed out in unison, “OHMYGODWTFBBQSAUCE!”
In my naivety, I believed them.  I saw 
the trailers featuring trains smashing through the streets of a heavily a popu -
lated city, of dudes in tuxedos fighting in zero-g, and of an entire metropolis folding in on itself. 
I thought, in my innocence, that no 
movie so critically lauded could ever be boring.  The kicker: it was directed by Christopher Nolan, who is known for 
blowing out brains like a gangsta with 
a gat. So I took my little brother and fought through the unwashed masses to see it opening weekend.
“Inception” was like watching over -
priced paint dry on pretentious growing grass, starring Leonardo DiCaprio.  “In-
ception” reminded me of that fat kid in high school who read Melville for fun-- 
it seems smart at first, but the more 
it talks, the more you realize it’s just a big, bloated lard sack that doesn’t know what the hell it’s talking about. 
There’s a great premise here: Pro -
fessional thieves who instead of steal-ing jewels or money, steal ideas direct-ly from peoples’ minds while they’re dreaming.  
With a little imagination, this could 
have been a hugely original movie that finely blended big Hollywood ac-tion movies with art house mind trip-ping.  But somewhere between “The 
Prestige” and “The Dark Knight,” Chris-topher Nolan ran out of imagination.
“Inception” starts off pretty intrigu -
ingly. The opening sequence where 
DiCaprio and his studly gang are at-
tempting to steal some vague secret from the head of a Pan-Asian politi-cian/businessman/chinchilla farmer(it never really explains what he is or why his suits are so damn fancy)  is balls-dropping awesome. It’s part “Oceans 
11,” /part Freddy Krueger, all sexy.
Eventually this sequence leads to 
the Asian guy, who from this point shall 
be referred to as “Mr. Roboto,” bribing Leo and his studly pack of studs to go double agent, and steal from the peo-ple that hired them. I think. I’m not en-tirely sure about this. I paid attention 
while I was watch-
ing the movie, but 
I don’t think Nolan paid attention while he was making it. 
But there’s a big 
trippy movie twist! 
Mr. Roboto 
wants this grab bag of beefcakes not to steal from their employer, but to 
plant an idea that will crumble the 
company! In return, he will grant Leon-ardo DiCaprio a pardon for murdering his wife, because you know, Japanese businessmen have the power to do that. It’s in the Constitution.Leo and his (life) partner, the kid 
from “Third Rock from the Sun,” set off to Paris to ask Batman’s butler-- who teaches at an anonymous big-name university-- if he has any students that could help them. 
Alfred offers his most American 
student: a scarf donning hipster chick who wouldn’t be out of place in Juno (Get it? Because she WAS in Juno!) 
In the next scene, Leo teaches Juno 
and her ugly boy jeans that she can do anything in the dream world.  It really 
builds this part up, showing her folding the city in two, making whole parts of the city appear out of thin air, and just being a god in general.  
Then Christopher Nolan left that 
idea in the dust and decided to make 
the rest of the movie about people 
with guns. 
“Dream big,”says the token Euro -
pean guy as he creates a dream-gre -
nade launcher and kills some dream-baddies with some dream-grenades.  That’s dreaming a little small, don’t 
you think, Nolan? It’s a dream world 
where you can literally make anything, and you opt for a  grenade launcher. 
Do you know what’s even bigger-
dreaming and light-years more bad-ass than a grenade launcher? A freaking tank. Then the hunk brigade (featuring Juno) wouldn’t even have to worry about dodging bullets. Justin: 1, 
Christopher Nolan:0.
“Inception” isn’t bad by summer 
blockbuster standards, but it’s not the 
gift from a benevolent god you mouth-breathers make believe it is. One com-menter on Imdb.com by the handle of D_Burke went as far to say that “In a decade, ‘Inception’ may be a religion.”  
D_Burke is a moron, and so is any -
body that thinks this movie is any kind of major step forward in the “art of cinema.” “Inception” isn’t even Chris Nolan’s best movie. It’s long, boring, unimaginative and there isn’t even a shot of a shirtless Christian Bale. 
Hospice roadshow helps patients  
By ERIN RAUCH
avenue writer  
A timid young boy and his family 
held their ticket and waited anxiously 
in line to have John Sikorski, local 
antique evaluation expert, evaluate their item.
Immediately after the boy placed 
his item on the desk, Sikorski’s eyes lit up. 
According to Sikorski, he had a 
1937 New York Yankees World Cham-pion Hamilton watch.
It was evaluated to be worth 
around $1,000. Sikorski urged the family not to sell the item because it was a “great piece of memorabilia.”  
They were not the only ones to leave with excitement in their eyes on last Saturday. 
More than 90 people came to 
have their items evaluated at the 4th 
annual Haven Hospice Attic Antique Roadshow and Donation Round-up.
Michael Ingram, manager of retail 
operations, said most people come to 
have family heirlooms evaluated and to purchase donated items. 
The treasure room premiered 
items that have been collected and 
researched for around five months at 
the event.
“The product revenue of Haven 
Hospice is in support of our unfund-
ed programs and indigent patients,” 
Ingram said.
Olivia Heims, volunteer liaison, has been volunteering with Haven Hospice for around 10 years. 
She said one of her favorite things 
about volunteering with the not-for-profit hospice is examining and re -
searching the donations.
“There’s always something inter -
esting and new to see,” she said. 
Heims said by the end of the event, 
the Attic will have sold 40 percent of the items in the treasure room. 
By the end of the following week 
most of it will be gone. 
Items such as a cowhide duffel 
travel bag, Polaroid camera, trumpet 
and an art deco writing desk were for 
sale.
“Customers are usually thrilled at 
the things they find,” Heims said. “We put items at below market value be -
cause we want to be fair to customers and return profit.”

An economics degree from Cornell 
University. A law degree from UF. Expe -
rience as a marketing director.These milestones had Eddie Mor -
dujovich on a fast track to becoming 
one of New York’s wealthy, young busi-nessmen. 
But they aren’t the reasons why 
he spends his time with Emmy Award-winning actor Joey Pantoliano. They 
played no part in the fact that, at 34, 
he’ll have his third book under his belt this October. And they don’t factor into the change in his posture or the smirk on his face when he talks about his job.
For that, he points to serendipity.Flashback to 2000. Fresh out of 
college, he was working as marketing 
director for Kargo, a wireless Internet 
company he said was too ahead of its time—it was created before wireless was available.
Inevitably, the company crashed, 
and four years out of college he was laid off, collecting unemployment checks every month.
He managed to get a temp job in 
New York’s New School doing admin-istrative work until the job ended in October and he was once again on unemployment.
That went on until December 2001, 
when he got a call from his friend and son of his childhood piano teacher, Gleb Klioner, who was working as Pantoliano a.k.a. Joey Pants’ agent, 
mentioning that Pants was looking for 
a new assistant.
A week later, he was on the set of 
“The Sopranos” in Queens, watching Pants as he went through his takes. 
When Pants had a break, he 
walked over to Mordujovich, sat down and interviewed him for the job.
The interview was one question:
“How fast can you type?”
He started working as Pants’ assis-
tant for free. 
He handled his schedule, went to 
the set with him, took his phone calls and acted as the assistant for the writ-er working on Pants’ autobiography.Then, on a Wednesday in March 
2002, he got the call.
“Hello?”“Hey, Eddie, it’s Joey. The writer left 
the book, and she thinks you can write it. You think you can put something down?”
“Sure.”“Get me a chapter by Friday.”Click.
Short of a tennis article that ap-
peared in the Cornell Daily Sun in 
1997, he hadn’t published any of his writing. 
But what he compiled in the next 
18 hours became the 10th chapter of Pants’ autobiography, and his first chapter as a writer. 
He was given six weeks to finish the 
rest of the book.
“I was chained like a monkey to the 
offices at Penguin Putnam,” he said.
He didn’t get a byline on the book’s 
jacket. This was because he also col-laborated with writer David Evanier, who came to help finish the autobiog-raphy. 
He said ghostwriters usually don’t 
have their names on the books they write. 
He was, however, listed in the ac-
knowledgments as “the great Eddie Mordujovich.” 
All he needed from there was en-
couragement.
The editor and publisher from Pen-
guin Putnam called Pants to comment 
on the new chapter. 
She said Mordujovich captured 
him in that chapter better than the 
previous writer had all along.
“I needed someone to tell me that 
I could do this f—king book,” he said. “It felt good.”Since then, he has ghostwritten 
another book, “How to Buy, Sell and Profit on eBay,” and was called in a second time by Pants to ghostwrite his contribution to Larry King’s “Remem-ber me when I’m Gone,” a collection of celebrities’ goodbye letters to the suspended talk show host.
But writing gigs weren’t paying the 
bills.
Mordujovich packed up and went 
to work at a bank in Jackson Hole, Wyo., where he met his wife.
But serendipity had him by the 
throat again.
Unannounced and unexpected, his 
sister died in New York at age 32. 
Worse, he remembers, their last 
conversation was an argument, end-
ing with her saying that he had ruined 
her life.
He decided a priority change was 
in order.
Mordujovich moved again in 2006 
to Florida for law school. His mother lives seven hours away in Miami.
While living in the sunshine state 
and going to UF’s Levin College of Law, 
he tapped his connection to Pants and 
co-produced “Canvas,” a movie about the plight of a father (Pants) and son, dealing with his wife’s schizophrenia.
The movie was well recieved. It won eight awards, and he was 
already working on a documentary about Pants before he had his law de -
gree in 2009.
And serendipity struck a third time. His documentary about Pants’ de -
pression prompted the start of a char -
ity for those with brain disease called No Kidding, Me Too!

Folk band uses old-time instruments for bluegrass feel   
By SARAH ARRAZOLA
avenue contributing writer  
Florida may be burning up, but-
Greenland is melting. 
At least according to this Gaines-
ville-bred folk band. It consists of a  
stand-up bass, a banjo, an electric and acoustic guitar and naturally, a  
suitcase that’s used to keep a beat.
Bands like Against Me!, Less Than 
Jake and Tom Petty have thrived in a musical environment like Gainesville.  Greenland is Melting shows that given 
the right environment, a new band can  
thrive.
“It’s an accepting music scene,  
which   is   very  rare,” acous-
tic   guitar  player Shaun Pereira, 23, said. “This is the kind of music scene   where people want to see  
new acts.”
Among the noise of rock, punk and 
other more popular genres, Greenland  is  
Melting sticks out like a blade of blue grass in an otherwise very green  field. 
Whether you want to call it blue -
grass, folk or something else, the  
genre is as eclectic as the name of the band itself.
One may find a true resemblance 
of the band from a slice of their song,
“Blood on the Banjo.”“I know, I know what I see may not 
be true, but I sure as hell know that my  
grass is blue.”
The band, having formed three years 
ago, has recently been picked up by an  independent record label called Paper 
and Plastick. The label was founded by  
Vinnie Fiorello, the drummer for Less 
Than Jake.
What the band may lack in age of 
existence, it surely makes up for in  
activity. Having played 130 to 140 shows in a dozen or so states, released  
two albums and tour -
ing and playing shows every 
month, Greenland is Melting  
has only started its journey.
“It’s going to get more intense start-ing next year,” said banjo player Karl  
Seltzer, 23, explaining that the 
band will release a split album, an  
extended play disc and a full-length album.
With a heavy load in store for next 
year, the members of Greenland is  
Melting still recall each of their humble beginnings.  For Pereira, he  
started as a boy playing anything but 
guitar.

TEEING OFF WITH TOM GREEN alligatorSports Podcast UF LACROSSEAlligator File Photo
Former UF star Corey Brewer used his basketball camp at Santa Fe College to 
help fight a battle that hits close to home -- both of his parents have diabetes.
This next statement defies 
all logic.
But here it is: Tim 
Tebow, arguably the greatest col-lege football player ever, is gone, and Florida’s offense will be bet-ter off because of it.
Now, I know we have all been 
taught that if A is greater than B, then AC must be greater than BC. While that may be consistently true in math, it isn’t in sports.
Chances are that current 
Gators quarterback John Brant-ley will never possess the type of game-breaking ability or overall skill that Tebow displayed each 
Saturday.
However, Brantley is the right 
one to lead this season’s offense.
Tebow needed former UF 
wide receiver Percy Harvin, who 
was named The Associated Press 2009 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, in order to succeed and hide his deficiencies in the pass-
ing game.
He was asked to do more last season in the 
absence of Harvin and 
the offense 
s t r u g g l e d at times be-cause of it. 
T e b o w ’ s 
game be-came pre-
dictable with a quick-strike aerial attack that targeted a select group 
of receivers and a good amount 
of quarterback dive plays mixed in.
This year, coach Urban Meyer 
is still looking for the guy to re-
place Harvin. 
However, Brantley will suc-
ceed either way.
This quarterback will keep 
you guessing. A versatile decoy 
like Harvin isn’t necessary.
He doesn’t depend on one 
stud receiver to help him, he gets everybody involved.
Let’s compare the numbers.In a Tebow-led offense, wide receiver Riley Cooper and tight end Aaron Hernandez combined to accumulate 1,811 receiving 
yards (55% of the team’s receiving 
yards), 119 catches (48 percent of the team’s completed passes) and 14 receiving touchdowns (50 per-
cent of the touchdowns through 
the air).
On the contrary, Brantley did 
not discriminate.
In the seven games he played 
last season, Brantley threw an av-
Gators offense should be better off with Brantley at the helm

ER’S DIABETES FUND AT SHANDS.
By TOM GReeN

Corey Brewer didn’t have this opportunity 
as a kid. 
Growing up in Portland, Tenn., Brewer nev-
er attended a basketball camp hosted by a pro-
fessional athlete. Instead he spent many of his 
summers helping his father Ellis, a diabetic, in the tobacco fields of his small hometown near the Tennessee-Kentucky border.
Brewer wanted to give other kids a chance 
he never had, and it’s a big reason why he de-cided to host a three-day basketball camp in Gainesville this week.
“It’s always fun to see the kids’ faces, be-
cause I know I would’ve been ecstatic to see a pro basketball player,” Brewer said, flashing his signature smile that many UF fans know well.
After winning back-to-back national titles 
at Florida as part of the group affectionately known as the “Oh-Fours”, Brewer wanted to give back to the Gainesville community and help raise awareness for a disease that hits close to home for him – diabetes.
The former NBA lottery pick of the Minne-
sota Timberwolves decided a basketball camp would be the best way to do that, and hosted Brewer’s Back 2 Back Youth Basketball Camp at the Santa Fe College gym this week.
About 50 kids attended the three-day camp, 
where they participated in drills, five-on-five games, contests and had sessions where they were able to ask Brewer questions that ranged 
from NBA-related matters to what his favorite 
college team was growing up (the answer is Kentucky), to what he likes to do in his spare time – which is being home with his family.
Not only was Brewer able to give the kids 
an opportunity he didn’t have during his child-hood, but he was also able to team up with 
Shands Health Care. Proceeds from the camp 
are going to the Corey Brewer Fight Diabetes Fund at Shands.
“It means a lot to me,” Brewer said. “I feel 
if I can help one person, it’s better than helping none.”
Both Brewer’s mother, Glenda, and his fa-
ther suffer from diabetes, so Brewer knows how crippling the disease can be. His dad lost both 
of his legs – one while Brewer was still in col-
lege and the other after Brewer made the jump to the NBA – and just recently lost his vision because of the disease.
Brewer said his diabetes fund was heavily 
influenced by his family and his personal ex-periences.
“I know how tough the disease is, so for me 
it was very important to do something for dia-betes,” he said.
Despite what his father has been through, 
his mother has managed her diabetes well, and 
still “acts like she’s 25.” 
Brewer wants people to know that diabetes 
is a deadly disease, one that 23.6 million chil-
dren and adults in America have. But he still wants to show that you can live a healthy life if you take care of the disease properly. That is why aside from raising money to help combat diabetes, Brewer used time at the camp to raise awareness for the campers and advise them to  
start getting checked for it at a young age.
“I started getting checked when I got to high 
school,” Brewer said. “I tried to get checked at 
least every year ... because a lot of people in my family have it. It starts at a young age, I feel, and everybody should get checked.”Brewer hosts three-day youth basketball camp

Maranda Smith has been through a lot 
in her college career, which was thought to 
have ended in April. 
But now the four-time All-American has 
one more chance to vie for a national title after the NCAA granted her a sixth year of eligibility Wednesday.
“I’m so grateful that the NCAA granted 
me another year of eligibility,” Smith said. “I’m really looking forward to competing with my Gator teammates again and hav-ing another chance to compete in front of the O’Connell Center fans is truly a gift.”
Smith began her college career at UCLA, 
where she made it through two meets be-fore a stress fracture in her right shin caused her to miss the rest of her freshman season and have a metal rod inserted into her shin.
After transferring to Florida in 2008, 
Smith tore her right labrum, but competed through the pain before having surgery on the shoulder prior to last season, which was 
expected to be her senior year.
Last season, Smith was second on the 
team to then-freshman Ashanée Dickerson 
with nine event titles – five on the uneven bars and two each on vault and floor – en route to being named a first-team All-Amer-ican on the bars.
Smith’s return is a great advantage for 
UF, which now returns 10 gymnasts from last year’s Southeastern Conference champi-onship squad that placed first at the NCAA North Central Regional in Salt Lake City and fifth at the NCAA Championships.
“We’re very excited for Maranda that she 
has been granted a sixth year of eligibility,” UF coach Rhonda Faehn said. “Maranda is a great leader and competitor. I’m sure the Gators fans will enjoy seeing her compete for another year.”20, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 29, 2010

We head into the homestretch 
of the alligatorSports’ preseason 
college football poll with the No. 3 team in our countdown: the Ohio 
State Buckeyes.
Last season, the Buckeyes fin-
ished 11-2 after winning their fifth 
consecutive Big 10 title and beating Oregon in the Rose Bowl on New Year’s Day. 
The 11 wins marked the fifth time 
in as many years that Ohio State finished the season with at least 10 wins.
Part of what made last year’s 
Buckeyes squad so successful was the team’s vaunted defense, which 
finished as the fifth-best scoring de-
fense in the nation, giving up just 12.5 points per contest and allowing opponents to accumulate just 262.3 total yards per game.
At the heart of Ohio State’s sti-
fling defense are two senior line-backers, Ross Homan and Brian Rolle. In 2009, Homan led the team with 108 total tackles (57 solo) while Rolle was second with 95 (37 solo).
The Buckeyes also return senior 
defensive tackle Cameron Heyward, who led the team with 6.5 sacks last season and was second on the squad 
with 10 tackles for a loss.
In the defen-
sive backfield it also returns cor-nerbacks Devon 
Torrence and Chimdi Chekwa (sev-en passes broken up), so the team should be in good shape there.
The defense should have no 
problem replicating the 2009 ver-sion, which will make the offense’s job much easier.
Ohio State isn’t known for hav-
ing a flashy offense, but the school does have a flashy quarterback in Terrelle Pryor. At 6 feet 6 inches tall and 233 pounds, Pryor certainly has the build and the physical tools to 
excel at quarterback, but will need 
to limit the mistakes, as he tossed 11 interceptions last season and was sacked 22 times while passing for 2,094 yards and 18 touchdowns.
As a dual-threat quarterback, 
Pryor also led the team in rushing, with 779 yards and seven scores.
Surrounding Pryor, the offense returns plenty of weapons for Pryor to use at his disposal, including its two leading receivers from last year in DeVier Posey (828 yards, eight touchdowns) and Dane Sanzenbach-er (570 yards and six touchdowns), as well running back Brandon Saine, who was second to Pryor in rushing 
(739 yards, four touchdowns).
Combine the talent Ohio State 
returns on the field with Jim Tressel 
in charge of things on the sideline, and the Buckeyes should be in great shape to win their sixth consecutive Big 10 championship and possibly book a trip to Glendale, Ariz., the site of the team’s last BCS title.
No. 3 Ohio State: Buckeyes will rely on stingy defense
Smith granted sixth year of eligibility
erage of about seven passes in those 
contests. Out of those measly seven passes, an average of about three dif-
ferent receivers caught the ball.
In other words, Brantley spreads 
the ball around, which keeps defens-
es from focusing its coverage on cer-
tain receivers.
The redshirt junior completed 36 
of his 48 passes in mop-up duty for 
Tebow last season and threw for sev-en touchdowns. That’s one endzone 
celebration for about every seventh 
passing play. 
This speaks volumes for his abil-
ity to complete long passes and grab 
chunks of yards at a time. He doesn’t 
need a Harvin-type player to create the big plays for him with yards after the catch.
Tebow, on the other hand, needed 
about 15 passes for every touchdown he threw last year because of the short-pass offense that was imple-mented to cater to his strengths.
So, in the spring when Deonte 
Thompson was quoted as referring to Brantley as a “real quarterback,” maybe, just maybe, he knew what he was talking about.CHIANG , from page 19
