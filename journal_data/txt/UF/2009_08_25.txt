UF study: 20 percent of drinkers under 21
By STEVE JOHNSON
Alligator Writer
According to a new study con-
ducted by UF's Department of Be-
havioral Science and Community
Health, 20 percent of drinkers areunderage, and those who are under-
age stay out later than those who are
21 years old or older.
"Gainesville has a pretty large
drinking culture," David Munroe,
a UF history senior, said. "Students
have pretty large social networks sothey can find fake IDs and eventu-
ally you can find someone to borrow
an ID from."
The study, published in the June
issue of the Journal of American
College Health, outlines the age of
drinkers, blood-alcohol levels anddrinkers' intentions of driving later
that evening.
The findings showed that more
than half of the participants were in-
toxicated while being surveyed.
Fifty-five percent of the men
and 59 percent of the women had ablood-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher.
The underage drinkers were found
to have higher amounts of alcohol
than those of age.
"I think younger kids would typ-
ically drink more in bars," Munroe

UCF enrollment may beat UF's by about 3,000 this fall
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
tstewart@alligator org
In addition to losing its title as the top party
school, UF may slip to No. 2 in enrollment
among state universities this year.
The University of Central Florida is pro-
jecting about 52,000 students. Just over 49,000
were registered at UF by Friday afternoon.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said it's like-ly that UF's numbers will grow, but it doesn't
appear enrollment will reach 52,000.
The number of students enrolled last fall at
UF was 52,112.
UCF spokesman Chad Binette said the
school expects enrollment to increase by about
1,750 from last fall because of a high retention
rate -the percentage of freshman who return
the following fall -and a record number of
transfer students, most of whom transfer from
Florida's community colleges.UCF has registered 4,700 transfer students
this fall, Binette said, and has a retention rate
of 85 percent, compared to UF's
State 94 percent.
News UF announced a plan in Aprilthat aims to reduce enrollment
from 2007's 51,725 students by
4,000 over four years.
"It's kind of a desired outcome," Orlando
said.
The expected drop will work in favor ofstudents, he said, by lowering UF's high facul-
ty-student ratio, which is more than 20-to-1.
The reduction in enrollment will also allow
UF to increase the percentage of graduate stu-
dents versus undergraduates, he said.
According to a December list from the
American School & University magazine
Web site, UF had the third highest enrollment
among U.S. universities, behind Ohio State
and Arizona State universities. UCF placed
fifth.
Study: Mulitaskers have more trouble ignoring distractions
WASHINGTON (AP) -People who multi-
task the most are the ones who are worst at it.
That's the surprising conclusion of re-
searchers at Stanford University, who found
multitaskers are more easily distracted and
less able to ignore irrelevant information than
people who do less multitasking.
"The huge finding is, the more media peo-
ple use the worse they are at using any media.
We were totally shocked," Clifford Nass, a
professor at Stanford's communications de-partment, said in a telephone interview.
The researchers studied 262 college under-
graduates, dividing them into high and low
multitasking groups and comparing memory,
ability to switch from one task to another and
being able to focus on a task. Their findings are
reported in Tuesday's edition of Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences.
When it came to such essential abilities,
people who did a lot of multitasking didn't
score as well as others, Nass said.Today

UF senior creates Web site for students' social lives
* THE SITE IS FREE FOR
REGISTERED USERS.
By JENNIFER TORMO
Alligator Contributing Writer
Moe's or Chipotle? Common
Grounds or Balls? Try something
new, or stick to the old and famil-
iar?
Figuring out what to do is about
to get easier, thanks to UF student
Adam Coelho.
Coelho, a marketing senior, justlaunched a new Web site, CitiSync.
com, to help students in college
towns find new places to visit.
"A lot of people fall into a rut
and do the same things over and
over again, and they don't know
about all the social options around,"
Coelho said.
On the site, users type in their
location and can browse categories
like restaurants, nightlife, entertain-
ment, outdoors and most popular.
After the category is selected, a
list of options with maps and rat-
ings appears, and users can select avenue to access detailed reviews so
trying new places is less risky.
"I absolutely hate making plans
with my friends," Coelho said. "I
like hanging out but not the actual
planning process."
Student CitiSync also acts asLife a social networking de-
vice, he said.
Users can start a "gathering" by
picking a place and and inviting
friends who are also registered on
the free site. CitiSync then sends a
text message and e-mail to those
users, allowing them to RSVP in-stantly.
While Facebook is useful for
larger events, Coelho said, CitiSync
is good for last minute plans and
smaller dinners with a select group
of friends.
The Web site can be used for any
city -the site is configured to au-
tomatically feed from Google Maps
and Yelp -and Coelho eventually
plans to list daily specials and more
detailed information for the busi-
nesses and add an event calendar.
Alex Sincore, a UF sophomore,
said he would rather text his friendsto make plans than use a Web site
and would probably only join if it
becomes as popular as Facebook.
"I might look at it since it was cre-
ated by a UF student, though, one of
my own kind trying to make a living
in this world," he said.
But Matthew Tayon, a UF fresh-
man, said he is learning his way
around town and is interested in
finding outdoor activities on the
site.
"I would just [use the site] on a
Saturday when I don't have any
plans," he said.

Woman claims sexual assault, robbery near Waldo Road
By KATIE EMMETS
Alligator Staff Writer
kemmets@a Illigator org
Police are searching for a man who alleg-
edly raped and robbed a 22-year-old woman
in southeast Gainesville Sunday night.
The woman told officers that she was
walking home from the Orange and Blue con-venience store on Waldo Road at about 9 p.m.
when she saw a man walking toward her.
When he got closer, the man grabbed her,
pulled her into the bushes and tried to take
her clothes off, said GPD spokesman Keith
Kameg.
Although she never saw a gun, the wom-
an said the man implied he had one with him,
Kameg said.
The man then rapedher and stole herpurse and the jewelry she
was wearing.
After being robbed, she
physically fought with the
man until he ran away.
"Although the area
where this happened has
some issues, we have never
seen anything of this mag-
nitude, which is why we want to find the sus-pect immediately," Kameg said.
The suspect is described as a black male
between 40 and 50 years old. The woman
described him as having a large build, facial
hair, and dirty matted hair.
She also said that when he was close to
her, he emitted a strong body odor.
Anyone with information about the attack
is asked to call GPD detective Nick Ferrara at
352-334-2470.

Police dog Justice
bites into crime
By KATIE EMMETS
Alligator Staff Writer
kemmets@alligator org
At the Gainesville Police Depart-
ment, Justice has four legs.
Although GPD has increased
the number of officers around town
due to an increase in robberies, po-
lice dog Justice was responsible for
two arrests over the weekend.
GPD was called to the 4800 block
of Northwest 20th Place at 12:44
a.m. Saturday when a woman re-
ported that her front door had been
kicked in.
When they arrived, officers ar-
rested three of the robbers, but
one ran into the woods, said GPD
spokesman Keith Kameg.
After 20 minutes, officers found
Cody Peiper, 22, but he refused to
come out with his hands up, Kameg
said. Officers then sent Justice into
the woods to fetch him.
On Sunday morning, police
were called to a home invasion rob-bery in the Georgetown Apartment
complex, 1324 NW 16th Ave.
At about 4 a.m., two men forced
their way inside one of the apart-
ments, Maced the occupants, and
took a small stainless steel box 
-
which held about $1,500 -from
one of the rooms, Kameg said.
Those in the apartment said that
one of the men was Cody Andress,
22, and that he had been in the
apartment before.
When officers arrived at An-
dress'house at 2915 NW 23rd Drive,
he came out of the garage with his
hands up but then attempted to put
them behind his back as if he was
reaching for a gun, Kameg said.
Officers released Justice, and
the dog stopped Andress before he
could reach for anything.
"The dog was not injured,"
Kameg said. "But I can't say the
same for the suspects."
Both men were taken to local
hospitals following the arrests to be
treated for bite wounds.Courses create 'digital culture'
Open to seniors, grad students
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Staff Writer
ctilIlo@all Iigtor org
Despite recent budget cuts,
the Digital Worlds Institute is
offering four new graduate-
level courses this fall.
The courses include Inter-
active Storytelling, Interdis-
ciplinary Research Seminar,
Entertainment Design and
Technology and Digital Cul-
ture and Convergence.
The department was able
to add the new courses be-
cause of grants and realloca-
tion of state funds, said James
Oliverio, director of the insti-
tute.
"We were able to reallocate
some of our limited resources
because of our belief in this
program," Oliverio said.
The institute, founded in
January 2001, offers a Master
of Arts in Digital Arts and
Sciences and provides an in-
terdisciplinary community
where students and profes-
sors come together to cre-
ate new technology and newtypes of digital culture, he
said.
He said they include les-
sons about creating virtual
reality inventions and writing
shows for live webcasts.
"We're trying to enrich
live experiences in the real
world by using the emerging
tools of digital culture," Oliv-
erio said.
The class-
U F es are open
Academics to seniors
and gradu-
ate students.
"We want to prepare stu-
dents to use these tools to ex-
pand their interests," Oliverio
said, adding that those who
enroll should be dedicated
students.
Pat Pagano, a digital media
engineer and professor with
Digital Worlds, said despite
the advanced nature of the
technologies used in the new
courses, seniors from any ma-
jor can take them.
Pagano said his virtual in-
teractions have increased his
social interactions by allow-ing him to talk with people
from China, Chile and Japan
whom he would never have
met.
The institute's inventions
do not take the place of real
life or limit his social interac-
tions, he said.
"Don't tell me that we're all
going to be the lifeless zom-
bies in front of the screen," he
said.
Rather, he said the insti-
tute takes new technology
and finds its core educational
benefit.
For example, the institute
partnered with the Levin Col-
lege of Law to create a virtual
law school complete with a
classroom, a courtroom and
a library.
Digital versions of students
and professors walk around
the school, and Pagano said
their real counterparts com-
municate using headsets.
Pagano said the institute's
use of digital media is prepar-
ing UF students for a "digital
revolution" currently taking
place in the United States.
"Innovation is one of the
things that UF prides itself
on," he said.

Is It Just Us?
Release of mass
murderer is not justiceJustice and compassion may be abstract concepts, but
that doesn't mean they elude all definition. Actually, we
know for a fact that the concepts of "justice" and "free-
ing a mass murderer" are mutually exclusive.
Abdel Baset Ali Mohmed al-Megrahi, better known as
the Lockerbie Bomber, was released by Scottish authorities
and sent back to Libya on Thursday night. Because the Scot-
tish legal system allows for "compassionate release" in the
case of terminal illness, al-Megrahi, who was diagnosed with
terminal prostate cancer, was allowed to return to his home
country. Al-Megrahi was the sole person found responsible
for the deaths of the passengers and crew on Pan Am Flight
103 in 1988.
Oh, by the way, al-Megrahi wasn't even in jail until more
than 11 years after the bombing.
Plus, after waiting more than a decade to be brought to
justice, al-Megrahi didn't even serve his full sentence. In-
stead of a life sentence, he only served a paltry eight and a
half years.
Complications ranging from Libya not wanting to release
al-Megrahi to an inability to find a "suitable" or "neutral"
ground for his trial in a case involving the murder of 259
people delayed justice for more than a decade. And, appar-
ently, once justice had already been delayed, the Scottish
government figured it was best to just forget the crimes even
happened.
Where is the compassion for the families of those that Al
Megrahi murdered? The deceased didn't get three months to
spend at home with relatives, knowing their fates and mak-
ing amends before facing their deaths.
"Compassionate release" should not extend to mass mur-
derers, period. The fact that the Scottish legal system allows
for this loophole shows that it has some serious, gaping
holes; the fact that the Scottish Justice Department did noth-
ing to close that loophole in this situation shows a serious
lack of common sense.
And still, there is no explanation given by Cabinet Sec-
retary for Justice Kenny MacAskill, the person bearing the
responsibility for the decision to release the terrorist. We
would think that if a government decision caused interna-
tional backlash, that government would be willing to defend
its decision.
This is literally the opposite of what happened last week
in North Korea. And, when Bill Clinton went to free two in-
nocent journalists from a dictator's labor camp, people still
managed to complain by construing it as fostering ties with a
tyrannical government.
But now, as the Scottish government frees a convicted
mass murderer in order to placate a tyrannical government,
people are somehow managing to not faint from a sense of
indignation. Hell, the most indignant "protest" we've seen
is a Web site asking us to boycott the sale of whiskey. Even
Libyans welcomed him back with a parade.
American politicians should do more than expound plati-
tudes about how justice was diverted and actually confront
the Scottish government with some questions.
Although we agree with the sentiment of the whiskey
protesters, we might need to ignore them and drink our own
weight in whiskey instead. It might be the only way to un-
derstand how this decision can be construed as justice.

Schools need foreign language focus
aving taken French classes since high school, Iam always impressed with someone who has
actually learned to be fluent in a foreign lan-
guage.
After encountering one such "fluent" speaker, I was
captivated, envious and in total awe -until this person
proceeded to demonstrate his self-proclaimed mastery
of French. What spewed forth was an incoherent mess
of verb disagreements, rolling R's and mispronounced
words, all disguised under an exaggerated French ac-
cent.
Perhaps this was just an example of idle bragging.
What is more horrifying, however, is the possibility that
this person actually thought he was fluent.
America in general does not value foreign languag-
es as highly as it does other academic subjects. Many
Americans whine that they will never use a second lan-
guage, and to be honest, this is probably true. They'll
probably end up using foreign language as much as
they use the geometry or U.S. history they were forced
to learn as early as primary school.
Yet foreign language education is largely absent
from elementary school curriculum. No need to torture
a young child's soft, malleable brain. It's best that we
teach foreign language in high school and college, when
the brain's capacity for language learning has signifi-
cantly decreased. It is so much easier that way!
And voilA! With a few semesters' worth of classes
and maybe a Rosetta Stone CD, students are touted by
the education system to be competent in a foreign lan-
guage.
These pupils venture into the world proclaiming that
they too can speak with the ease of a native, even if thisAllison Griner ease is limited to the ability to or-
Speaking Out der a pizza.
Of course, saying that you
are fluent sounds better than ex-
pressing minimum proficiency in a language. And what
prospective employer wouldn't value the illusion of flu-
ency over honesty?
The fact that so many Americans claim to be fluent
in a second language demonstrates how low foreign
language standards are in this country. Fluency is not
about speaking flawlessly or knowing every word, but
it does imply the ability to express complex thoughts
and emotions. This ability is not garnered over a few
weeks of reciting vocabulary lists.
Yet we may never be confronted with our inadequa-
cy in foreign language. The United States is a relatively
isolated country; unlike European countries, the U.S.
is not encircled by vastly different cultures with vastly
different languages. Our borders are not so fluid as the
EU's, and when a different ethnic group does enter in
large number, we view it as a cultural threat. Heaven
forbid a Hispanic speaks too much Spanish.
Given all these barriers, even the slightest knowl-
edge of another tongue is a victory; it suggests the will-
ingness to learn.
However, keeping standards for foreign language so
low only breeds an overestimation of one's ability. Be-
ing able to pass an AP class shows significant potential
but not fluency.
The fact that so many students today profess to be
"fluent" in an acquired language makes me wonder if,
in fact, we are speaking the same language.

Nation's addiction to bickering, celebrity news steals air time
ealth care reform, Michael Jacksonand Lady GaGa's penis. What do all
of these things have in common? To-
gether they comprise 99.9 percent of the news
cycle, and I never want to hear about any of
them ever again. Under any circumstances.
Period.
Take health care reform: Turn on Fox
News, CNN or MSNBC and you will hear
the same narrative played out, just with a dif-
ferent bias. The Democrats want health care
reform, Republicans do not, and everyone
has an opinion. Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly
incite Midwestern farmers to carry pitchforks
(and apparently automatic weapons, too) to
health care town halls, while Rachel Maddow
and Keith Olbermann urge the far left to ac-
cuse all who oppose reform efforts of beingNazis and hating babies.
We get it -everyone has an opinion and
no one, except for a few confused Blue Dog
Democrats, is willing to compromise. So stop
whining and talk about something else. Re-
port when something actually changes or the
debate shifts.
And don't even get me started with Mi-
chael Jackson. While it certainly is entertain-
ing to hear about how the city of Los Angeles
was considering asking patrons to pay for
attending Michael Jackson's funeral, does it
really have any tangible impact on our lives?
The very fact that the city government would
foot the bill for a multimillion-dollar memo-
rial service and shut down Los Angeles' big-
gest highway in the middle of the day for one
car to drive through is mind-boggling to me.Kyle Robisch
letters@alligator.orgSure, the man's
music was catchy and
he was undoubtedly
talented, but the major
and local news net-
works should not be
covering his death like
it is breaking news a
full two months later.
The man wasn't a
peacemaker or an influential public figure, he
was a confused singer. That's it.
Truth be told, I can almost understand
the addictive coverage of health care reform
and Michael Jackson. Almost. But a bulge
in Lady GaGa's dress? Really? There can be
absolutely no justification for this being on a
news network for any amount of time. Endof story. Penis or not, who cares? Or should
care?
What this all boils down to is America's
obsession with gossip and conflict. The health
care coverage, while important, is repetitive
and uninformative.
America is only fixated on it because we
enjoy watching the warring factions battle
it out and make ludicrous claims. When it
comes to MJ and Lady GaGa however, they
are irrelevant. America is infatuated with its
celebrities, and it is flat-out disgusting. When
people across the world are dying of starva-
tion, warfare and disease, all America can do
is debate the femininity of Lady GaGa.
Shame on us.

Students should root for Rays
This is in response to Kyle
Maistri's "Fanifesto," in which he
groups the Tampa Bay Rays with
the Yankees and Red Sox as three
baseball teams which are off lim-
its to bandwagon fans.
I am no bandwagon fan. I have
been loyal to the (Devil) Rays
ever since their inception. How-
ever, the notion that the Rays
have evolved into something as
sinister as the Red Sox or Yankees
is laughable.
Are you telling me that one
year of success after a decade of
futility should preclude students
from rooting for the team? Please
remember that the Rays are the
closest major league team to theuniversity.
What's the matter? Still bitter
about the Victor Zambrano trade
with your precious Mets? Or are
you trying to reinforce the con-
trived rivalry with your Marlins?
I have news for you. No one in
Tampa cares about the Marlins.
Watching the National League is
like watching female high school
basketball -it's only bearable
when you're drunk.
Speaking of the league, where
were the National League teams
in your "Banned-Wagon"? What
about the West Coast Wannabes
sporting flat-brimmed Dodger
blue at a perfect 33.3 degree
angle? What about the millions
in the country who live and diewith every pitch on the north
side of Chicago just because their
second cousin's barber's dog was
a Cubs fan?
It seems to me that your list of
unacceptable teams is arbitrary
and ill-conceived. Next time,
please do your homework before
you make any ridiculous claims.

Towers should be more tolerant
Moving back to campus af-
ter summer break is a hectic ex-
perience. My daughter and I, in
between moving into her new
apartment near the campus andshopping at several local stores
for essentials, decided to go to
a local restaurant for a quick
takeout lunch. Traffic was, as it
always is on the last weekend be-
fore classes, very heavy with new
and old students buying from ev-
ery type of area retailer.
After parking in a small lot
and spending about five minutes
ordering subs in a local sub shop,
we exited to see our truck being
towed away.
A "gentleman" was keeping
guard on the second floor of the
plaza and literally calling in the
crews to tow vehicles that he be-
lieved weren't patronizing the
right businesses.
In the less than five minutesthat we were gone, our truck
was towed. I guess that the tow-
ing businesses were feeling left
out of the shopping frenzy going
on, and a few guys were going to
work together to see that they all
got their piece of the pie.
We saw no less than 10 vehicles
being towed on the last move-in
weekend when tolerance should
be higher while customers shop
at local businesses.
What a pathetic welcome from
the Gainesville community on
what should be an exciting week-
end for all. How greedy, pathetic
and unneighborly. Shame on all
involved.

Data no surprise to restaurants
DRINKING, from page 1
said. "Once they get inside, they can
drink to their hearts' content."
Three hundred five men and 164
women participated in the study,
which was conducted on four nights
during July and August between 10
p.m. and 2:30 a.m., according to a re-
lease from the UIT News Bureau.
Each participant was asked to
blow into a Breathalyzer and answer
a 15-question survey upon leaving a
bar in the midtown bar district.:
Other aspects of the study includ-
ed participants' willingness to drive
that evening after leaving the bar.
The study found that between 10
p.m. and 11 p.m., 7.4 percent of the
participants intended to drive within
the hour, in contrast to the results
from 11 p.m. to 12 a.m., in which 18.8
percent intended to drive.
The highest percentages came be-
tween 12 a.m. and 2 a.m.
Of the 469 participants, 27.2 per-
cent said they would drive when
asked between 12 a.m. and 1 a.m.
Before the bars closed, 38.6 percent
said they would drive when asked
between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. However,
after the bars closed, that number
dropped to 7.9 percent.Establishments like The Swamp
Restaurant are not surprised to hear
the findings of the survey.
"I really think they are using a lot
of fake IDs that are very good IDs,"
said the restaurant's general man-
ager Mike Taphom. "I wouldn't be
surprised if [the results of the study]
were accurate."
Taphorn said he has hired 12 peo-
ple to continually watch for underage
drinking at night.
He said that ID scanners have be-
come obsolete due to underage drink-
ers borrowing real IDs from friends.
"We constantly check
Student IDs and wristbands," he
Life said. "I'd always say that
the bars aren't purposely
trying to serve these underage kids."
The Underage Prohibition in Al-
cohol Beverage Establishments Act, a
Gainesville City ordinance that went
into affect April 1, has had bar and
club owners on the defensive. The act
punishes bars and clubs that have a
specific number of underage drinking
violations after 9 p.m.
"We've always had protocol and
systems in place to keep an eye on un-
derage drinkers," Taphorn said. "Just
last week I confiscated 50 IDs to turn
into GPD."YogaBerry to serve same coffee brands
DEJA BREW, from page I
Copy manager who originally came up with
the idea for DjAi Brew.
"The clientele just wasn't there to keep
the place running," Ford said. "I'm heart-
broken, but it's business."
YogaBerry co-owner Mark Turner de-
scribes the future store as a new layer to
the existing coffee shop, as opposed to a re-
placement.
"We'll be keeping their line of coffee, but
just kicking it up a notch," he said.
D jA Brew currently serves Boomerang
and Sweetwater, two locally roasted brands
of coffee.
YogaBerry will offer several flavors of
sour frozen yogurt, including original and
green tea. The dessert is served with differ-
ent types of fruit, including mango, pineap-
ple and blueberry.
The Gainesville store will purchase in-
season fruit from Rainbow Fruit Company,
a local fruit distributor, Turner said.
However, the store's hours won't be the
same. YogaBerry will close at 2 a.m. with a
possibility of extending store hours in the
future, Turner said.
"That'll be determined by how late stu-
dents are looking for frozen yogurt," he
said.
Turner believes that a major audience for
YogaBerry is college students.
The company has stores open adjacent to
the Florida State University campus in Tal-lahassee and University of North Florida in
Jacksonville.
Matthew Daley has worked at Library
West since 2001 and has made the three-
minute walk -five if he misses the light -
to D6jA Brew since it opened, often visiting
several times a day.
"They've created a very welcoming at-
mosphere. Hopefully [YogaBerryl will keep
that," Daley said.
He said he remains open to the change
and will still give the new vendor a try be-
fore making his final decision.

Tebow returns to full
practice after injury
By PHIL KEGLER
Alligator Staff Writer
pkegler@a Iligator org
Urban Meyer doesn't bother
asking Tim Tebow if he's hurt any-
more.
The answer has almost always
been yes, but Florida's senior quar-
terback participated in all of Mon-
day's practice after he recovered
from a sore lower back that held
him out of contact drills during
practice last week.
"He's not going to tell me,"
Meyer said. "[Strength and condi-
tioning coach] Mickey [Marotti] is
the guy he talks to. I'll get all the
inside scoop from Mickey.
"Don't ask me because I don't
know."
This was just the latest in a long
list of injuries Tebow has played
through in his career.
He revealed Monday that he
played most of 2008 with an in-
jured non-throwing shoulder, the
same one he hurt against Ken-
tucky in 2007. He reaggravated it
during last year's season opener
against Hawaii and took painkill-ing injections for the remaining 13
games. This was in addition to the
three games last season that Tebow
played with a hyperextended knee
as well as the broken right hand he
suffered in the 2007 FSU game.
He underwent surgery in Janu-
ary to remove a bone spur and re-
duce chronic
shoulder.
Footballinflammation in his
"It's more com-
fortable than it was
last year or the year
before," Tebow said.
"It's just so much
easier now. I can
take hits and smile,
not grunt. That will be nice."
Tebow guessed his latest back
injury simply came from over-
training for the season, which
opens Sept. 5 against Charleston
Southern.
Now, he's happy with how he
feels.
"I will never pull myself out of
a game," Tebow admitted. "I just
love playing too much. Some could
say it's probably just being hard-
headed."Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF quarterback Tim Tebow participated in all the drills at Monday's practice after sitting out part of last
week's practices with a sore back. The senior has played through many injuries during his career.
Sports show common bonds
They say that travel expands themind, but in the few short weeks
I spent in England, Ireland and
the Netherlands this summer, I found
just the opposite to be true.
You grow up believing in some kind
of other, that people from other parts
of the world are so much different than
yourself.
But really, there is no other. At least
in all the most important ways, people
are all the same -only the food and
money changes.
The college-age guys who I met put-
ting back pints in the pubs of London
had the same interests as my friends
back home.
Drinking, chasing women and, most
importantly, sports were all high on the
priority list.
It's hard to describe the passion
English fans have for soccer, but it's
somewhere in the neighborhood of
Southeastern Conference football, only
slightly more violent.Mike
DiFerdinando
Beg to DiFer
mdiferdina ndo@a Iigator orgI quickly
found that if
you're willing
to talk soccer
(even if you're
an ignorant
American), peo-
ple had plenty
to say.
The conver-
sations were
strangely familiar.
Seemingly every team in the English
Premier League was run by an incom-
petent manager doing his best to run a
beloved club into the ground.
There were plenty of overpaid play-
ers who hadn't done one thing to live
up to the ridiculous amount of money
they were making.

Chelsea supporters are nothing more
than rich West Londoners who know

SEE DIFER, PAGE 19Vargas decides to transfer
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
a berry@alligator org
Eloy Vargas' brief career at Florida has
come to an end.
Vargas is not enrolled in classes for the fall
semester and is no longer a part of the Gators
basketball program, a UF spokesman con-
firmed.
Although the Gators now have one fewer
option in the frontcourt, the team likely won't
be strongly affected by Vargas' decision. Sev-
eral news outlets reported that he might have
been academically ineligible for the 2009-10
season, and despite being a dominant high
school player, Vargas was ineffective as a
freshman.
The 6-foot-10 forward played sparingly
last season, seeing time in just nine games
and averaging 0.6 points and 0.7 rebounds
per game. He missed both of the team's ex-hibition games and the first 11 regular-season
contests while recovering from offseason
ankle surgery.
Vargas has yet to announce where he will
transfer, although it seems he has a strong
interest in Kentucky. On his Twitter page, he
posted last week that he "will be takin a visit
to Kentucky Wildcats this
weekend."
Orlando Antigua, who
heavily recruited Vargas
during his time on Pitts-
burgh's coaching staff, is
now an assistant to Ken-
tucky coach John Calipari.
varga Vargas is the 11th play-
er to transfer from Florida
since 2003-04. That list includes recent trans-
fers David Huertas (Ole Miss), Brandon Pow-
ell (Marshall), Jonathan Mitchell (Rutgers),
Jai Lucas (Texas) and Allan Chaney (Virginia

Munroe sidelined 4
with knee injury
U THE REDSHIRT SENIOR MISSED ALL OF 2008
WITH AN ACL TEAR IN THE SAME KNEE.
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@a Iligator org
The injury bug has bitten Dorian Munroe again.
The redshirt senior safety from Miami Coral Reef High will
miss five to six weeks due to a damaged meniscus in his right
knee, the same knee that caused him to miss the 2008 season.
Munroe was injured in practice over the weekend and had
his knee scoped Monday.
"That hurts us, it hurts him, and we love him," coach Urban
Meyer said. "We were hoping we wouldn't have to do it, but
they told us over the weekend that he has to, so we had it done
[Monday]."
The injury comes at a terrible time for Munroe, who was
slotted for regular playing time in the Gators' rotation. While
Munroe is sidelined, freshmen Dee Finley and Josh Evans will
fill his role.
Munroe was expected to be a starter last season before tear-
ing the ACL in his right knee during the summer, paving the
way for Ahmad Black to take the field and ring up seven inter-
ceptions, tied for the nation's most.
HOWARD NAM ED STARTER: Defensive line coach Dan McCar-
ney named sophomore Jaye Howard the starter at the other
defensive tackle position next to junior Lawrence Marsh.
McCarney said Howard has come on strong beginning this
spring and is currently ahead of junior Terron Sanders, who
started for Florida last season.
Sanders is still expected to play a large role on the line and
could be used to spell Marsh as well.
RAINEY WORKING AT RECEIVER: The task of filling Percy Har-
vin's role is no easy one, but Meyer is calling for all hands
on deck. Running back Chris Rainey has joined Jeff Demps,
Brandon James and freshman Andre Debose as the players des- Safetignated to have a dual role in the offense.

onto a good bandwagon when they
see one.
Conversely, it seems that the fine
people of Kensington (the area of
London where Chelsea FC resides)
wouldn't be caught dead slumming
it over in Highbury with the Arsenal
riffraff.
Soccer was a sport I was familiar
with. One I really like. Cricket, on the
other hand, was a mystery to me.
I happened to be in England while
the country was playing host to the
Cricket World Cup.
If you don't know, cricket matches
can last quite a while -days, even.
This meant by the time my friends
and I had made our way home from
the pubs (which, strangely enough,
close at 11 p.m.), there was enough
time to catch an hour or so of cricket.
I spent hours watching the sport
during a two-week period. I still have
no idea how you win a cricket match.
But I did find it to be entertaining.
Cricket is a lot more like baseball
than most people think, and the guys
who play it are incredibly athletic.
I doubt cricket sweeps America
any time soon, but if you're surfing
the high channels of your satellite
TV one day and come across an India
and West Indies test match, stop in
and check it out for a few minutes.
While cricket was a pleasant sur-
prise, rugby was a bit more like I ex-
pected it to be.
The England Lions Tour to South
Africa was in full swing by the time I
touched down at Heathrow Airport,
and people packed the bars to watch.
Aside from the ultra-tight short-
shorts and occasional eye gouging, it
was pretty enjoyable to watch -a lot
like American football.
Forwhatever reason, Ijust couldn't
get into rugby, though. I guess it just
wasn't different enough.
To me, it lacked the passion of soc-
cer and didn't really deliver the nov-
elty of cricket.
If there is one lesson I'll take with
me from my trip overseas, it's that
sports can be a great vehicle through
which to see the world.
Sports can teach you about people
and a culture in ways that taking a
tour or seeing sights never could.
When you take time to discover
what people are passionate about,
you see who they really are.
The Florida football fan with a
painted chest and a flag he's wearing
as a cape and the Stoke City soccer
fan with a scarf around his neck have
a lot more in common than either of
them might think.
If you ever get the chance to go
somewhere new, take it.
You don't have to cross the ocean
to see something you never have be-
fore.
Take a road trip to some away
football games this year. Baton Rouge
might be just as foreign to you as
London.
Or hey, if you're really adventur-
ous, there's always Starkville, Miss.
