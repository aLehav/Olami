alligator.org. Heart-attack victim saved by pizza deliveryman
LAKEWOOD, Colo. (AP) — Ordering a pizza may have 
saved George Linn’s life. Linn’s wife said he had just gone into 
cardiac arrest Friday when the pizza deliveryman knocked on the door of their Colorado home to bring their order. Kami Linn said she opened the door to “some burly-looking dude” and immediately asked for help.
The deliveryman, Chris Wuebben, happened to be a para-
medic recently returned from Iraq.
Kami Linn said Wuebben performed CPR on her husband 
and revived him. Other paramedics who later arrived then took over. George Linn remains in the intensive care unit.

David Frank has 25 years of mul-
timedia experience with The New 
York Times.
UF’s College of Journalism and 
Communications is looking to hire 
a multimedia expert. Frank applied 
for the position, but he wasn’t hired.
At The Times, Frank has been the 
director of photography, photo as-signment editor, picture editor and a video journalist, which is his current position. But Frank doesn’t have a graduate degree, so his experience isn’t enough for the university to 
consider hiring him.
This is one example of UF’s 
growing focus on academic require-
ments for faculty. Colleges, such as the College of Journalism and Com-munications and the Rinker School of Building Construction, require graduate degrees for faculty, al-though the same educational stan-
dard isn’t held for professionals in 
their respective fields.
The journalism school needs 
someone to run the 21st Century News Laboratory, a lab intended to provide professional-level multime-
dia training for journalism and tele-
communication students.
UF Provost Joe Glover said that 
the university generally wants fac-ulty with graduate degrees. But it’s not always required. Once or twice a year, a waiver process can be used to overrule some positions’ require-ments, he said. 
But David Os-
troff, chairman of the search com-mittee for the news lab posi-tion, said he was told by an associ-ate provost in a hiring orientation 
that the require-
ments wouldn’t be waived. Of the 
more than 20 applicants for the po-sition, a number of them had excel-lent qualifications but did not have graduate degrees, Ostroff said.
Graduate students will be using 
the lab, and it would be hard for someone without a graduate degree 
to teach them, he said.

� PUBLISHERS NOW HAVE TO 
EXPLAIN CHANGES MADE FROM EDITION TO EDITION.
By KAT BEIN
Alligator Writer
Legislation that U.S. Congress passed 
in 2008 designed to reduce rising textbook 
costs went into effect July 1 and should 
start benefiting college students across the country when classes resume this fall.
As part of the larger Higher Education 
Opportunity Act, the Textbook Affordabil-
ity Law is intended to lower textbook pric-
es by implementing three provisions writ-ten by Assistant Senate Majority Leader Sen. Dick Durbin (D–IL).
Textbook publishers are now required to disclose prices, as well as explain chang-es made from edition to edition, when marketing their books to professors.
Currently, professors choose the texts 
their students use before each semester and according to research done by Student Public Interest Research Groups, 77 per-
cent of professors said publishers rarely 
mention costs.
“Professors tell me they don’t even 
know the prices of the books they assign for classes,” Durbin said in a conference 
call Wednesday. “Now there’s no excuse.”
The second provision makes sure that 
bundled, shrink-wrapped textbooks will 
be a thing of the past, as publishers are 
now required to sell each item separately 
to give students a choice. 
The research groups found these mate-rials, like CD-ROMs or supplemental texts, raise costs by 10 percent to 15 percent even though most students and professors nev-
er use them.
Finally, schools must provide a textbook 
list to students for each course offered dur-
ing registration, so they have more time to shop around and 
find the best deals.
Durbin said he hopes that, 
given this information, most 
professors will choose the most affordable 
option for students, and students will have 
the resources necessary to save themselves money.
Durbin said textbook prices have been 
rising at twice the rate of annual inflation for the last two decades. It has become such an economic burden on students that many students choose to forgo buying textbooks at all, which hurts their perfor-mance in class, Durbin said.
Steven D. White, a professor of mar-
keting and international business at Dart-mouth University, said he’s seen this hap-pen countless times in his classroom.
“This has become more pronounced,” 
he said of students choosing to go with-out texts. “I can’t tell you the number of students who come to me after performing badly on the first exam [and ask] to bor-
row my desk copy.”
Durbin admitted that this is only the 
first step in the battle against overpriced 
textbooks. 
He said he’s now working on legisla-
tion that would mandate the use of gov- Textbook law intended to save students moneySEE FACULTY, PA gE 4

� THE UNION’S GROUND 
AND FIRST FLOORS WILL BE OPEN UNTIL 3 A.M. 
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
Students who study late will 
have a little more space to spread 
out in the fall semester.
Student Body President Ashton Charles announced during Tues-day’s Student Senate meeting that 
the ground and first floors of the Re-
itz Union will be open until 3 a.m. beginning in the fall.
The Hub, which is the current 
late-night study hangout, will likely close at 8 p.m. on weekdays starting in the fall
Currently, the Reitz Union closes 
anywhere between 9 p.m. and 1:30 
a.m., depending on the day of the week.
“It’s just a logical move,” Charles 
said of the change. “We’ll be saving 
money and allowing more space for students to be there.” 
She said 
moving late-night study hours to the Re-
itz Union will save the university about $35,000. The costs of keeping 
the ground floor and first floor open late will be taken out of the Reitz 
Union budget. 
In the fall, the Taco Bell and Star-
bucks in the Reitz Union will intro-duce later business hours, and Sub-way may follow suit, she said.
Charles said this move not only 
saves money, but it addresses some safety concerns created while the late study hours were held in the Hub.
“[The Hub] was really difficult to get to,” Charles said. “People were trying to park, or if they lived 
on campus they had to walk in the 
dark.”
The Reitz Union has more secu-
rity and more parking, Charles said.
She said she has seen many stu-
dents studying at the Reitz Union until it closes anyway. 
“It’s just legitimizing the fact that 
people can study here,” Charles 
said. Reitz to replace Hub as late-night study spot in fallLOCAL

Counterfeiters stole $9,136 from Satch-
el’s Pizza in May, but now the restaurant’s 
bank won’t compensate.
Satchel Raye, owner of the restaurant, 
said it’s not the counterfeiters that irk him, 
but the bank.
“We feel the bank did us wrong,” he 
said. “We feel like a victim of Compass Bank more than the check fraud.”The checks were created because the 
business’ mail, including checks, was be-ing stolen out of the mailbox. Raye said the counterfeiters used high-tech equipment to make fake paychecks. Those checks 
were then cashed at Compass Bank loca-
tions around Gainesville.
Five checks were for $1,356 and one 
was for $2,356. Raye said Satchel’s doesn’t often give payroll checks that high, and he 
thinks the bank should have seen that all 
six checks were cashed on the same day.The restaurant pays its employees 
about $35,000 every two weeks, so Raye had to be careful with money to make sure his restaurant could stay afloat.He said if $6,000 more had been stolen, 
then the business would’ve struggled to make ends meet.
The bank, he said, reimbursed the mon-
ey and put it in his account, but the next 
day, it took the money back.
Raye said the bank’s reasoning was that 
it didn’t need to refund him because he 
used a stamp for a signature on his checks – something, he said, the bank suggested 
he do to fill out large numbers of checks 
at once.Satchel’s Pizza owner loses about $9,000 in scam

UF generally wants faculty with grad degrees
hired Frank, but it would’ve been nice 
to at least have considered him, said Da-vid Carlson, the executive director of the Media Center for Media Innovation and Research at the journalism school. Carl-
son, who will oversee the news lab, is a 
member of the search committee for the multimedia job.
The graduate-degree requirement has 
been an issue since the beginning of the search for applicants, Carlson said.
“The provost has a different view than 
I,” he said. “The provost looks at the uni-versity in broad ways, while I see just a 
small part of it.”
Whomever UF hires to work at the lab 
will report to Carlson, who doesn’t have 
a graduate degree. In some ways, Carlson said he’s less qualified than Frank. 
But the graduate-degree requirements 
make sense because the university has said it is a research university, Ostroff said. Some universities choose to forgo 
accrediting their colleges. Boston Univer-
sity’s journalism program, for one, is not accredited. It will not have any professors with doctorate degrees until UF Journal-ism department chairman William Mc-Keen leaves to chair the program in fall.
UF’s graduate-degree requirements 
are a concern to students like journalism junior Steve Johnson. Johnson met Frank last year when Frank came as a guest lec-turer for a week in the fall.
“Journalism is a trade, not a profes-
sion,” Johnson said.
All students benefit from learning 
from experienced faculty, 
he said.
“If you’re in med school, 
you want to learn from 
doctors who are practic-
ing,” he said. “If I wanted to learn how to do open-heart surgery, I don’t want to learn from someone who learned it by the book; I want to learn from someone who does open-heart surgery.”
UF’s journalism college wasn’t always 
so strict about graduate degrees. Rae O. Weimer, the namesake for the college’s building, didn’t have an undergraduate degree when he came to UF as the head of the journalism department. He helped turn the Department of Journalism into the College of Journalism and Communi-cations in 1967.
“In some fields, professional experi-
ence is equally important,” Glover said.
He used the art program as an ex-
ample. An accomplished artist might not have a graduate degree, but a waiver could be considered to bring him to UF, he said.
The search committee has chosen two 
finalists for the lab job who will visit the 
university for final interviews. 
Carrie Pratt, a multimedia producer at 
the St. Petersburg Times and an adjunct 
lecturer at UF in the spring, will arrive Monday. According to her application, she expects to complete her master’s de-gree in visual communication from Ohio University this summer.
The other finalist, Katherine Reed, is 
an associate professor at Missouri School of Journalism and an editor at the Colum-bia Missourian. She received a master’s degree in creative writing from Hollins University in 1992.

� PATIENTS FROM OUTSIDE SHANDS’ 
PRIMARY SERVICE AREA WILL BE SENT TO OTHER CARE CENTERS.
By LIDIA DINKOVA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Shands at UF will be forced to close its doors 
to some of its poorer patients.
Because the Florida Legislature’s special 
session was adjourned before it reviewed a 
re-installation of $9.7 million in the hospital’s budget, Shands will have to refuse medical care to non-emergency patients from outside of its primary service area who are uninsured or under-insured.
This decision will take effect within the next 
30 days. Gov. Charlie Crist cut the $9.7 million from the 
hospital’s budget back in 
May. As a teaching hospital, 
Shands accepts patients from all 67 Florida counties, but with the lack of funding it will focus on the 13 counties that fall under its primary service area.
“We are forced to limit charity care,” Shands 
spokeswoman Kim Rose said. “Emergency pa-tients we will stabilize, but if there are services closer to their home equivalent to ours, we will redirect them there.”
“It is both devastating and perplexing to 
us given that the governor recommended this 
funding as part of his budget and approved it 
in his previous three plans,” said Tim Goldfarb, CEO of Shands HealthCare, in a news release posted on Shands’ website.Shands to

While students can find reason to celebrate, Santa 
Fe College student David Rozier said he thinks it’s too early to get excited.
“I feel that as professors, I don’t think they’re going 
to do as much as we’d expect,” Rozier said, who works 
for textbook rental service omg.bookrenter.com. 
Rozier is glad about the law, but he sees a lot of work 
ahead.
“Schools are all about the money,” he said. “I think 
it’s something slowly people will transition into.”
Durbin said students need to be assertive about their 
rights and contact university administration if they don’t 
notice these changes being implemented. 
If that fails, he urges students to contact their local 
representatives, who may notify the Department of Edu-cation.TEXTBOOK , from page 1OnCampu s

� DEFENSE ALLOWED 10.4 
POINTS PER GAME LAST YEAR
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
tgreen@alligator.org
 
The second half of the alligator-
Sports’ preseason top 10 poll begins 
with our No. 5 team, the Nebraska Huskers.
Last year, Nebraska went 10-4 and 
came within seconds of winning the Big 12 Championship game against Texas before a trip to the Holiday Bowl.
The most impressive thing about 
the Huskers in 2009 was their de-fense, which finished as the No. 1 scoring defense in the nation, allow-
ing just 10.4 points per game.
That defense was anchored by 
Ndamukong Suh’s pass-rushing , but 
he was drafted No. 2 overall by the Detroit Lions, leaving a clear void on the line. They also lost safety Larry Asante, who was third on the team in solo tackles (42) and broke up seven passes while intercepting two.
However, the defense does return 
cornerback Prince Amukamara (41 solo tackles, five interceptions) and defensive linemen Pierre Allen and Jared Crick, which should help the Huskers remain among the nation’s best defenses.
On offense, Nebraska ranked 75th 
in the nation but returns its leading rusher in Roy Helu Jr. (1,147 yards and 10 touchdowns) and leading re-ceiver in Niles Paul (796 yards and four touchdowns).
Helu will be joined in the backfield 
by Rex Burkhead, who will be used as a change of pace for the Huskers’ 
run-heavy offense, but a second re-
ceiver will need to emerge.
The biggest question on offense 
will be whether or not senior quar-terback Zac Lee progresses from last year’s up-and-down performance. If he can’t, sophomore Cody Green will be asked to step up.
If Nebraska can pull everything 
together, Bo Pelini and his team will again be vying for a conference cham-pionship, and perhaps even more.No. 5 Nebraska:
Big 12 North favorites COLLEGE FOOTBALL
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer

Sports agents have been at the center of 
many negative college football stories this 
year. As NCAA violations involving agents continue to surface, their business strategies 
and recruiting tactics are being questioned.
Florida is one of the latest schools to join 
the trend. A report came out on Monday ac-
cusing former Gators center Maurkice Pounc-ey of receiving money from a representative of an agent while still playing for UF.
“Allegations aren’t all that surprising 
to me. Rumors have been around for quite a while,” sports agent and CEO of Dynasty 
Athlete Representation Darren Heitner said.
“It’s just a matter of the fact that it seems 
as though the public is taking a lot of interest 
in it because of what recently transpired at USC with Reggie Bush.”
Pouncey is currently represented by Joel 
Segal, who had his firm Blue Entertainment Sports Television recently bought out by Lagardere Unlimited, a French conglomer-
ate that is looking to make a big statement in 
sports representation in America. 
Segal also works as the agent for Bush, 
Chris Johnson, Michael Vick, and former Gators Riley Cooper and Percy Harvin – among others.
But an agent other than Segal could be the 
one behind the alleged scandal. 
The only reason one would give a student-
athlete improper benefits is to recruit them as a client, according to Heitner.A failed attempt to lure Pouncey to their 
firm could be at the root of the alleged viola-tion.
“We in the industry understand that there 
may be many instances where agents are giv-
ing players money, and those agents don’t 
even end up signing the player,” Heitner said.
If Pouncey is found to have accepted the 
money before the Sugar Bowl, many expect the NCAA to force Florida to vacate its win against Cincinnati in the BCS bowl game. However, Heitner doesn’t believe the athlete should be blamed in this scenario.
“Sometimes the play-
ers don’t understand what they can or cannot do ac-cording to NCAA, state and federal law,” he said. “Really, the burden should be on the agents not to vio-
late those rules.”
UF and the NCAA are 
conducting an investiga-
tion after Florida self-reported the potential rules violation.
University Police Department Capt. Jeff 
Holcomb confirmed through e-mail “that the UFPD began the investigation into this case on June 9th and it is an ongoing investiga-tion.” 
“I think UF did a fantastic job,” Heitner 
said. “By reporting it to the state authorities, and by saying they will comply with any in-vestigation on the NCAA level, that is exactly the model that other schools should follow.”Agent problem is common

Advocate
Why college stars should 
be paid
He had a great career playing for the Gators and 
was able to transition to the pros as the 18th over-all pick in the draft, but recently Maurkice Pounc-
ey has been accused of accepting $100,000 from a sports agent’s representative while he was still on the Gators’ roster. 
He denies it, and coach Urban Meyer said at SEC Me-
dia Days that he believes Pouncey. It may turn out that Pouncey acted in his own interest, but we owe him the benefit of the doubt at the very least. But this news brings up a question as old as the NCAA itself: Should athletes be paid?
College sports are romanticized as the last bastion of 
amateurism in American sports, where athletes are driven by passion for their sport and not a paycheck. But let’s not kid ourselves. It’s a business.
Most sports aren’t bringing in a lot of money, but no-
body can deny the importance of the Gators football team as a financial asset to the school. A good team sells a lot of tickets, wins a lot of games and gets the university a nice check at the end of the year for playing in a big-name 
bowl game. Giving athletes a free education is simply not 
enough; most Florida residents already get that through programs like Bright Futures, and there are similar pro-grams in other states.
There are restrictions on how many hours a school can 
require athletes to practice, but the time players spend in the weight room or studying game footage usually doesn’t factor into the tally. It all adds up to being more than a full-time job. Trying to tack on another 20 hours a week to 
earn some spending money is a hard pill to swallow, mak-
ing back-alley deals from agents even more enticing.
We aren’t advocating it, but it happens. Miami Hurri-
canes players were getting under-the-table payouts from 2 
Live Crew star Luther Campbell in the early ‘90s. Florida 
State Seminoles players were taken on all-you-can-carry Foot Locker shopping sprees. And let’s not forget about those paid internships doled out to University of South-ern California Trojans during Pete Carroll’s reign. If the 
allegations against Pouncey prove to be true we would be 
more than disappointed but far from shocked.
Getting through school on a shoestring budget is hard 
enough without the time commitment and responsibility 
of being on a team, but treating kids like indentured ser-
vants while their athletic  feats are writing checks for Jum-botrons only adds insult to injury.
It wouldn’t take much money to keep kids afloat, and 
more than likely a small paycheck could help keep some 
student athletes in school through graduation day — not 
to mention it would probably cut down on those embar-rassing stories of athletes stealing to get by, ahem, Cam Newton. It wouldn’t compare to the amount of money ath-letes could make in the pros, but at least it would help.
Maybe it would kill the magic a little bit, and maybe it 
would snuff out the amateurism — but it might do won-ders for integrity. In the meantime we’re keeping our fin-gers crossed and hoping that Pouncey is blameless. For the last two weeks, I have given advice for incom-
ing UF students to use as they acclimate themselves to university life. This week, however, I write to lend a 
word of advice to all university students. Whatever grade, alma mater, or status as a student, listen up: Don’t drink from the punch bowl.
I consider myself a conservative. To me, politics is a mat-
ter of opinion and personal preference. In my world, you can believe what you want, and we can still have a decent and re-spectful conversation. Fortunately, this is the mindset of the typical, reasonable citizen and a tenet of American political 
philosophy that allows our nation to flourish and prosper.
On the college campus, however, it becomes a different 
story. There is often only one tint to the worldview lens, and 
that is generally on the red end of the spectrum.
The best advice I can offer, to both new students and insti-
tutionalized academics, is to make up your own mind about 
your political persuasions.
I have come to understand that a college campus can be 
a tough place to be a conservative. For one thing, a lot of 
professors have lived for so long in an ideological world of paper-applicable theory that they have lost touch with the realities of the rest of society. I am not speaking about all UF professors — but some. 
Often, professors will not only teach from a leftist stand-
point, they will demonize in-class disagreement. This is not free and open intellectual curiosity. It is rigid dogmatism, and I have encountered it all too often on our campus.
We are all bound to run into this situation at some point 
in our college careers. Political science classes can be the most depressing when the professor’s only purpose is to indoc-trinate. The syllabus reaches no further than The New York Times editorials, and in-class movies are shown to stir emo-tions and lay guilt on the student for having been successful enough to be in college.
The worst ingredient of the bunch, 
however, is the rubber stamp, overtly outspoken liberal student who sits in the back of the classroom egging on the professor, preying on timid re-bellions from independent-minded moderates, and lavishing a practiced vocabulary like it is an entitlement to 
speak endlessly. 
It all creates a recipe for complacency and stifles opposi-
tion to the college political machine.
Even out of the classroom, we are forced to think in only 
one direction. Protests and demonstrations from “liberated” campus thinkers make every issue black and white, right and wrong, and leave no room for interpretation. You enter col-
lege and are told by the indoctrinated masses to be tolerant 
of intolerance.
Don’t back down. You are not close-minded for having a 
political persuasion that opposes your professor or the guy 
or girl shaving his or her head on Turlington Plaza. I value both my Republican and Democrat friends and the reason-able civic activist.
Learn the facts, and listen to the issues. If you find yourself 
on either side of the political spectrum of your own accord and decision, congratulations. Welcome to the adult world.
There are political extremists on both sides of the aisle. 
Professors of either persuasion can sometimes be drawn into molding adolescent minds to their political liking. More com-monly, however, we find faculty willing to push students to the left. 
You are about your opinion. Stick by it, it makes you the 
person you are.

Like an episode of “Deadliest War -
rior,” Florida saw its own battle be-
tween two epic foes Tuesday, this 
one during a special legislative session called to pass a measure that would put the question of banning oil drilling on the November ballot. In The Florida Legisla-
ture vs. Charlie Crist, I have to give this 
one to the Legislature, and a quick kill it was—about 55 minutes, to be exact.
Though Crist was fighting for the peo-
ple, or—as others argued—for his next 
job, he did it with an arsenal of the wrong 
weapons. Choosing to push for a special session that was vehemently and openly opposed by House and Senate leadership 
only promised a waste of taxpayer dol-
lars. Yes, one can argue it was the House’s choice to kill the amendment with a mo-tion of limited debate followed by an early adjournment, which then forced the Sen-
ate to do the same, but Crist should have 
seen this coming a mile away.
The governor, far from being a politi-
cal newbie, has been attacked with Repub-
lican spears of hostility since earlier this 
year when he announced his move to the dark side, otherwise known in politics as the Independent Party. Longtime staff quit his campaign, donors dropped their fund-ing and Republican leaders took it person-ally. 
The conflict is nothing new—even 
when Crist was on Team Republican, he was never “Republican enough” for lead-ers of the party, mainly due to his moder-
ate stances on social issues like gay adop-
tion and abortion. In fact, a joke around the Senate always concerned “Crist the Democrat,” and conservative eyes would roll when his name was mentioned. Even 
so, in the current time of partisan politics 
and extreme fringe candidates, Crist does exemplify an interesting new battle tactic. 
By bucking both parties and instead 
opting “for the people,” Crist has won over moderate voters on all sides of the po-litical spectrum. He’s leading in the polls for U.S. Senate, despite his sister running his campaign and his Republican donors 
moving to right-wing Team Rubio. Could 
this possibly mean that—gasp—people are more concerned with policy than party? That maybe partisanship isn’t as good of 
a strategy as some politicians want you to 
believe?
If Sun Tzu were in the business of po-
litical strategy instead of war, I think he might agree. After all, he did say, “Travel by unexpected routes.” 
Crist certainly is not 
a conventional, modern candidate, and he 
is doing exactly what the master of war described as “of supreme importance”:  at-
tacking the enemy’s strategy. With the call 
for a special session, Crist knew that either way the vote went, he could tout it as a win. If a “yes” vote, Crist would take the obvious win by getting what he wanted. 
But if a “no”—which in this case is what 
happened—he could easily pass it off as just another bunch of elitist lawmakers who don’t believe the people should have 
a voice in policy—a “snub,” as Crist called 
it in a statement.
So, for the final tally: one for Crist for 
making the legislature (mainly the House, which limited debated and adjourned in 
less than an hour) look like every politi-
cal stereotype voters hate, but 1,000 for the Republican-controlled legislature, which takes the surprise win. Here’s why: While 
the House played bad cop, the Senate 
played good cop, shaming the House for leaving without giving the people a choice and arguing in favor of placing the amend-ment on the ballot. In one word, brilliant! Demonize the House for doing something that the Senate leadership was in favor of 
from the beginning (i.e., voting the resolu-
tion down), but coming off like the hero anyway.
The House played scapegoat, and, 
whether intentional or not, it worked like something straight out of Tzu’s playbook: “All warfare is based on deception.” Ap-parently modern politics are, too. In the end, Crist lost some political capital—at 
least $55,000 worth, the cost of the failed 
session—but took some Republican blood down with him, though not nearly enough for a win. His loss is exacerbated by call-
ing a session destined to fail and coming 
off looking like the move was simply po-litical—an easy fix would have been to ex-pand the session to more than one agenda item, a session to workshop the economic 
issues facing the Gulf Coast, something 
facing Floridians now. Maybe then Crist would have come out on top.
The Republicans won this battle, but 
the question of who will win the war is far more intriguing … and one that might be answered come November.

Speaking Out
It is clear that Chris Moody, despite his attempts to 
seem educated and informed, is exactly the opposite. Like most opponents of Arizona’s new immigration 
law, SB1070, he has clearly never even read the actual bill. 
Mr. Moody claims that if passed, this legislation would 
allow police officers to question anyone they wish about 
his or her immigration status, using race as the determin-
ing factor regarding who they specifically question. 
Yet, anyone who has actually read SB1070 will realize 
that such a statement is an egregious error. 
Within the bill, specific provisions outline two impor-
tant factors that negate Mr. Moody’s allegations. Here, I quote directly from SB1070’s text:
“For any lawful contact made by a law enforcement of-
ficial or a law enforcement agency of this state (Arizona) 
or a law enforcement official or a law enforcement agency 
of a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state where reasonable suspicion exists that the per-son is an alien who is unlawfully present in the United States, a reasonable attempt shall be made, 
when practicable, to determine the 
immigration status of the person.”
What this means in layman’s terms is that Arizona law 
enforcement cannot merely pull someone off the street be-cause they suspect they are an illegal alien. 
A person must already be involved in some other po-
lice incident (typically by committing another crime) to be 
checked for his or her immigration status. 
This is contrary to Mr. Moody’s assertion that, “legal 
immigrants henceforth need to have proof of citizenship at all times.” 
Obviously, if a legal immigrant does not plan on com-
mitting a crime, there is no need to carry proof of his or 
her legal status. 
Case closed. 
But what about Mr. Moody’s charge that this will in-vite racial profiling? 
If he actually read SB1070, he would find again that his 
assertions are misinformed. 
I quote again:“A law enforcement official or agency of this state or 
a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may not solely consider race, color or national origin 
in implementing the requirements of this subsection.” 
If this isn’t clear enough, I’ll explain. 
It means that the “cops” can’t question your status just 
because of your color or looks. 
Therefore, instead of various opponents of this law 
attempting to paint this legislation with the convenient brush of racism and bigotry in order to prevent the enact-ment of a legitimate state law, they should do a little more investigation into the liberal talking points they hear out 
of the mouths of Rachel Maddow and Keith Olberman.

ONLINE: Alex Orlando / Alligator“action” figures
Singers and guitarists Brian Cag, right, and Anthony Li, left, both of Action Item, a five-piece pop band from New Jersey, belt it 
on stage at 1982 on Saturday. Avenue writer Alex Orlando interviewed the band and had his own opinions of the show. “Gaines-
ville’s a hard nut to crack for out-of-town performers. Action Item stood out in the way it interacted with the crowd because of its 
teen pop sound. The band typically opens for thousands of screaming girls at Justin Beiber concerts, so it seemed out of place 
playing in front of 30 beer-drinking college kids. Sweat-drenched and tired, they returned to the tour van with disappointed looks 
on their faces.” Action Item’s new album, “The Stronger The Love,” is set to be released on Aug. 2.
Games you may have missed: ‘Alan Wake’ for Xbox 360  
By JOSH ISOM
avenue contributing writer
In a quarter swarming with high-pro -
file sequels like “Red Dead Redemption” 
and “Super Mario Galaxy 2”, it may have been easy to overlook an original game 
for something flashy, familiar and safe.  
To overlook “Alan Wake,” however, is a fool’s 
mistake that should be rectified immediate -
ly.
Released on May 18, “Alan Wake” is a sin-
gle-player, third-person psychological thriller developed by Remedy Entertainment, the minds behind the “Max Payne” series. The game was in development for more than five years, and the extra layers of polish show.
“Alan Wake’s” strongest asset is the story. 
Without spoiling too much, the game follows protagonist Alan Wake, a best-selling hor -
ror novelist who hasn’t been able to write a 
word in more than two years. Attempting to 
alleviate his mental block, Wake travels with his wife, Alice, to the remote country town of Bright Falls. After settling into a rented cabin, a dark presence drags Alice’s flailing body to the depths of the town’s lake, leaving Wake to follow a breadcrumb trail of manuscript pages while fending off shadowy apparitions with a flashlight and a gun.
The manuscript pages are the driving 
force of the plot. Narrated by Alan Wake’s su -
perb voice actor, Matthew Porretta (“Robin Hood: Men in Tights”), each page foreshad -
ows – sometimes outright reveals – future events. It’s a testament to Remedy’s ability to set a scene when the event that unfurls feels fresh and invigorating, as if the player walked into it clueless and blindsided.
The sense of atmosphere that permeates 
the town of Bright Falls is top-notch, particu -
larly the contrast between night and day. 
In the enveloping darkness of the night, 
it’s the little touches - the swish of a throw -
ing axe as it pierces the howling night air; the twisted, garbled speech of the nightmare-in-flicted townspeople – that instill a genuine 
sense of anxiety and paranoia. In the day -light, the bright light and the autumnal colors 
lull the player into a false sense of security, a point not lost on Remedy.
Those who wish to explore are rewarded 
with some of the richest collectibles to date. TVs are scattered throughout various build-
ings that play episodes of the show “Night 
Springs,” a spoof on the 
classic “The Twilight Zone.” Radios can be found that 
broadcast a local, late-
night talk show comment-ing on the events in Bright Falls. 
Those seeking a chal-
lenge by beating the game on the hardest difficulty are rewarded with additional manu -
script pages to pour over.
My only issue with the game are the won-
ky camera controls. Throughout the game, the camera hovers unattached behind the player’s back, unable to decide which shoul-der it wants to look over. This isn’t a problem 
when using a flashlight because the beam of light acts as a targeting reticle. Without the flashlight, there’s no way of telling where the 
player is aiming. 
The effect is disorienting and made col-
lecting items and turning on radios an abso -
lute pain. 
I found myself sprinting through these 
sections, not out of fear, but out of annoy -
ance. An option to attach the camera view to the shoulder would improve gameplay. 
Other than completing the game on the 
hardest difficulty, “Alan Wake” is a relatively short game that offers very little replay value. If you’re looking for one of the year’s stron-
gest contenders for the “BioShock” throne, 
and you have the money, go for it, but for those looking to stretch their $60 as far as it can go, rent the game instead. 
The game has been recieved favorably 
by critics. It has a score of 83 on Metacritic com, with an average user score of 8.7. The game’s creators confirm sequels are in pro -
duction. 
Despite its flaws, “Alan Wake” is an 
experience that should not be missed.  
The game  is  available  now  for  the  Xbox  360.

Mike “South” Strother and then-girlfriend Kayden Kross smile for the camera at the Flamingo Show 
Club in Dayton, Ohio, a regular hang-out spot for the porn producer, director and actor.
Pornographer worked for NASA before adult-film career  
By KAT BEIN
 avenue writer  
When Mike Strother was a kid growing up in the 
60s, he wanted to be so many things. He liked science. 
He pictured himself as a biologist, a chemist, an as-tronomer and finally an astronaut.
Now, at the age of 52, he’s doing something a little 
different. He’s a producer, director and actor in his own amateur films, but he doesn’t make movies like the ones they show at Sundance.
Mike Strother is an amateur pornographer.That’s not to say that he doesn’t know what he’s 
doing. Strother, better known in the industry as Mike South, is a very decorated director. He’s won, and been nominated for, dozens of Adult Video News awards, 
the Academy Awards of porn. One was for most outra-
geous scene, in which he filmed a girl-boy sex-capade smack dab in the middle of a rave in Tampa.
“I’m 52 years old. Most of the girls I date are in their 
mid to early 20s,” he said, “and I make money for it. It’s kinda like, you know, I found my calling.”
Backtrack to before. That kid who wanted to be an 
astronaut got pretty close to his dream once. Before porn, Strother worked for NASA handling sexy things 
like relation databasemanagement and expert sys-
tems knowledge bases- your typical AI-type stuff. In his own words, he was a technogeek.
He said he first got the idea to change jobs at a con-
sumer electronics show in Los Angeles. The porn guys found out he lived in Atlanta and pestered him about what a “hotbed for pretty girls” he was sitting on.
He said, at the time, the industry was begging for 
more amateur videos with scenes starring regular peo-
ple and couples, not porn superstars.“Next thing I know, there I was shooting a girl and 
her boyfriend and he couldn’t get it up,” Strother said. 
“Finally he turns to me and says, ‘She doesn’t get paid if I can’t perform, does she?’ and he said ‘Here, give me the camera and you f--k her.’”
That was back in 1993. Fortunately, the dudes at 
headquarters loved the video and especially loved Strother’s “down-home Southern character.” This led to a number of unique, Mike South amateur-video se -
ries, which led to a lot of money, success and young 
girls for Mr. Mike South.
“Everything that I ever released, I always insisted 
that it had my name on it,” he said. “I wanted to do 
that name-branding and that turned out to be a good move on my part.”
As the world moved into a new century, Strother re -
alized the frontier of porn was online, and he now owns several websites. 
Some of his greatest successes are southernbuk -
kake.com and stripperfacials.com. He admits there’s a pattern and said, in the vastness of cyberspace, you’ve gotta have your niche.
“Every girl is like ‘I wanna do girl-girl’ and I’m like 
‘Honey, I can’t even give that away.’”
His most heavily trafficked site is actually his blog, 
mikesouth.com, which features no videos but divulges all that’s good, bad and ugly with the industry.
“I’m very well-known for reporting on the industry 
both good and bad,” he said. “People check daily just to make sure they’re not up there for something stu -
pid. I get tons of death threats, that’s always fun.”
Death threats or not, Strother is more than happy 
being Mike South. After 20 years in the business, he said he has no plans to retire anytime soon.
“I’m having too much fun doing what I’m doing.”Rum 101: 100 years of history, revelry and cocktails 
By RICHARD STEHLI
avenue writer  
Rum. Australians overthrew their 
government for it. The Royal Navy 
got a daily ration of it until 1970. 
George Washington demanded it at his 1789 inauguration. Although it’s been around for 100 years, we still 
drink it like there’s no tomorrow.
Unlike many other types of alco -
hol, there is no international stan-
dard for what constitutes a “rum.” Each country sets its own guidelines 
for how rum is made, which allows 
for a good amount of variety and lo-cal tradition around the world. Gen-erally speaking, rum is made from fermented sugar cane, either juice 
or molasses, distilled to at least 40 
percent alcohol, and then aged in oak barrels.
Within those very general guide -
lines, there is endless variety. Light rum, a specialty of Spanish-speaking countries and islands, has a clean, sweet taste and is good for subtle drink mixtures. 
English-speaking countries and 
islands tend to produce darker rums, aged in heavily charred bar -
rels for a stronger, fuller molasses 
taste. French islands are known 
for their rhum agricole, made with sugar-cane juice for a natural sugar-cane flavor. Distill rum to a high con-
centration, and it becomes 151.
Although you should feel free to 
drink your rum neat, rum cocktails 
are worth trying. The International 
Bartenders Asso -
ciation recognizes seven rum-based cocktails: Cuba Libre (AKA “rum 
and coke”), Dai-
quiri, Long Island Iced Tea, Mai-Tai, 
Mojito, Piña Colada and Planter’s 
Punch.
While all of these drinks can help 
you beat the heat, my personal fa-vorite for the summer is the piña co -
lada. Instead of setting yourself up 
for major disappointment with store-bought piña colada mix, experience the islands: Buy a coconut. Pound a 
couple holes in the coconut with a 
nail and drain the milk into a blend -
er. Smash the empty coconut with a hammer, then scrape out some of the meat and add it to the milk.
Add an equal amount of light 
rum or coconut rum and three times that amount of pineapple juice and chunks if you like its texture. Add a 
bunch of ice and blend until smooth. 
Shred some of the remaining meat and mix it with sugar. Wet the rim of your glass and then set it in the 
coconut-sugar mixture to frost the 
glass.
This might sound like a lot of te -
dious work, but it makes for quite 
the sensation at a party when you 
bash a coconut open on the back steps with a hammer. 
More importantly, it makes one 
heck of a good drink. 
If you aren’t so handy, just buy 
cream of coconut and shredded coconut and proceed accordingly. Whatever you do, don’t use an artifi-
cially flavored mix; respect your rum, 
and do this wonderful summertime beverage justice.

Bootsington T. Cat: A column of reverence befit for a feline king hjum
Rarely is a man so great that even the 
legends written about him fail to truly capture the magnificence of his exis-
tence. This is one of those situations. This is an especially unique case, however, because the great man I am writing about is not a man. Readers, put on your monocles and be seated 
in your favorite fireside chair, for I shall chroni-
cle the life and times of my cat, Boots.
Bootsington T. Cat (“Boots” for short) came 
to me a few years ago and has changed my life for the better, simply by the virtue of me 
being in his stately presence. The quintessen-
tial gentleman, an air of dignity (and a trail of shed hair) follows him wherever he roams. And oh, how he roams! When I brought him 
from my hometown to my new abode here in 
Gainesville, I brought him outside so that he could grow acclimated to his new surround-ings (Boots is not a mere “indoor” cat, for no boundaries can hold his insatiable desire for adventure). However, during the aforemen-
tioned acclimatization, he eluded me and dis-
appeared into the foliage. I anxiously waited for his return for a whole 24 hours, desperate -
ly attempting to avoid imagining a world be -
reft of his magnificent aura. As I finally began to come to peace with what I believed to be a terrible new future, Boots emerged from a dense thicket with a satisfied wanderlust and a mighty hunger for a good meal. I shall never 
know what his travels consisted of, since, you 
know, he’s a cat and stuff.
I am not the only one privy to the brilliance 
of Boots. Just today, my roommate found him-
self in conflict with Boots over who should 
claim the bed for his afternoon nap. The argu -
ment became heated, and my roommate was intimidated; he slept on the couch while Boots claimed his 
rightful position on the 
bed. My roommate’s cowardice, while em-barrassing, was the 
correct response to 
the situation, as Boots would not have thought twice about beating 
him about the head and neck repeatedly. 
Recently, some sort of rapscallion queried 
if I should ever photograph Boots and caption it in the fashion of so-called “lolcats.” Truly, it was a question only an imbecile would ask. 
Associating such poor grammar and decorum 
with such a grandiose being as Boots would be an insult of the most egregious sort! Be -sides, Boots would never ask if he “can has cheezburger.” His taste is much more refined. If there were a caption to a photograph of the 
dignified Bootsington T. Cat, it should read: 
“Perchance I may sample some of your finest Beluga caviar?” 
Only then would the qualities of this fan-
tastic feline be properly projected.
Dearest readers, if you find yourself won-
dering why this normally juvenile writer is writing with such fine language, or why you suddenly feel the urge to wear a silk robe and 
listen to Mozart, know that it is simply a phe -
nomenon that occurs when Boots is being dis-
cussed. He is a shining example of class and excellence, and we should all endeavor to be 
more like him.
(Don’t worry, guys, I’ll make fart jokes next 
week.)

The hot dog on my plate fright-
ened me. But as I sat at Gator Dawgs 
on West University Avenue armed with a half gallon of milk, a loaf of 
bread and a box of Kleenex, I knew it 
was too late to back out. I was about to eat a Ghost Chili Dawg, topped 
with sauce from the bhut jolokia, 
known as the ghost pepper, the hot-test in the world. 
“Dammit,” I thought. “I should 
have passed the story off on some -
one else.” It wasn’t the first, or even 
the fifth time I’d had that thought. I 
was sorry a week prior, about three seconds after I told Avenue editor 
Jon Silman that I wanted to eat a 
ghost chili pepper and write about it.
As with my childhood dreams of 
winning an Olympic gold medal or becoming an astronaut, the glory of the achievement had overshadowed 
my realization that it would be a gi -
ant pain in the ass. Spicy heat is measured in Scoville 
units, determined by the level of the 
nerve-stinging compound capsaicin 
in food. A particularly hot jalapeno 
is about 10,000 Scovilles. Ghost peppers can be 100 times hotter, 
at about 1 million. Once I started 
research for the article, my regret turned to flat-out fear. I watched 
one YouTube video after another 
of people eating the pepper. Some vomited. Others curled on the floor 
in agony. Wikipedia told me the pep-
per is grown in India, where police use it in smoke bombs and hand 
grenades. It’s great for controlling ri-
ots and flushing terrorists from their hideouts.
I read that the more spice you eat 
the more your body can tolerate, so I began to put Tabasco on everything. 
Rice and Tabasco. Toast and Ta-
basco. Avocado-and-cream-cheese sushi and Tabasco.
A woman in India earned a place 
in the Guinness World Records by eating 51 ghost peppers in two min-utes. Afterward,  she smeared hand -
fuls of the seeds in her eyes.  
Candy Britt, who owns Gator 
Dawgs with her husband Otis, said she ordered the pepper from New York after she saw it on the television 
show “Man v. Food.” 
“My son really likes spicy food, 
and he wanted to try it,” she said.  The Britt’s daughter, 9-year-old Ga-
brielle, said the ghost chili sauce, which includes olive oil and butter, 
was “freakin’ hot.”  
Otis said he considered asking 
customers to sign a waiver before eating the pepper. Instead, he wrote 
on his price board that the item is “XXXXtra hot.”
Desperate for a pepper-eating 
partner, I asked Otis to eat with me. “Hell no,” he laughed. Instead, his 
18-year-old son Keary and Alligator 
writer Andrew Pantazi volunteered. With the Alligator staff laughing in the 
background, the three of us ate our 
hot dogs in silence. It took me seven glasses of milk, one slice of Wonder Bread and 18 extra-soft Kleenex to get through half a hot dog. My eyes watered, my ears popped and my stomach ached. But nobody vomited or had a seizure. Now, a day later, my only symptom is the gas.THURSDAY, JULY 22, 2010   � ALLIGATOR, 11

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. – Maur-
kice Pouncey has his story and 
he’s sticking to it.
After being accused of accept-
ing $100,000 from a representa-
tive of an agent, Maurkice and the 
Gators have been silent on the is-
sue.
On Wednesday, Florida coach 
Urban Meyer and the Pouncey brothers used Southeastern Con-
ference media days to finally ad-
dress the potential NCAA viola-tion.
When Meyer was alerted of the 
allegation about six weeks ago, he immediately confronted Maur-kice, who responded, “that didn’t happen.”
Maurkice’s twin brother, Mike 
Pouncey, also denied any NCAA violations.
“I talked to my brother and it’s 
not true,” Mike said.
Maurkice took his claim even 
further on Wednesday.
“I have completely cooperated 
with the investigation and an-swered any and all questions put 
to me,” he said in a prepared state-
ment. “I did not accept $100,000, it is an absolutely ridiculous claim.”
Even though Maurkice gave his 
twin brother a Cadillac Escalade 
after being selected in the first 
round by the Pittsburgh Steelers, Mike was never worried about his eligibility for the upcoming sea-
son.
He is more concerned about his 
family’s reputation.
“I feel bad because it ruins 
somebody’s name because of somebody who really doesn’t 
know who me and my brother re-ally are,” Mike said. “It’s hard.”
A recent string of potential vio-
lations involving agents has arisen 
this offseason, prompting a quick 
meeting on the issue between Meyer and Alabama coach Nick Saban, who learned on Wednes-
day of reports that Crimson Tide 
defensive end Marcell Dareus has allegedly been declared ineligible after attending a player-agent party in South Beach.
But in reality, Meyer believes 
there is little a coach could do to prevent these types of incidents.“You can’t,” he said. “For a 
coach to figure out who a runner is in a nightclub at 2:30 a.m. – I’ve 
been asleep for four hours.”
Saban even went on to propose 
that agents, who affect the eligibil-
ity of a player, should have their license revoked for a year.
But that still doesn’t stop 
an agent’s runner from lurking around campus. 
“It’s an epidemic right now, an 
epidemic that needs to get fixed,” Meyer said.
UF TAKeS AWAY HAMMOND’S 
SCHOLARSHIp
After being arrested on June 13 Pounceys deny allegations

Even though National Signing Day was in February, Flor-
ida’s 2010 recruiting class added another key piece Wednes-
day.
Chris Martin, a five-star defensive end out of Grandview 
High in Aurora, Colo., who was enrolled at California, an-
nounced his plans to transfer to UF. 
“I would like to thank everyone who has been support-
ive of me through my crazy mental episodes,” Martin said 
on his Facebook page. “A special thank you to my mother and father who have supported me no matter what. I love you both. God has 
granted me a second chance. A chance I cannot 
mess up. With that said. Go Gators. Thank you to everyone and all the coaches who showed 
their interest in me.”
Martin, who is ranked second among strongside defensive 
ends and 18th overall in the class of 2010 by Rivals.com, com-mitted to California in Dec. 2009 and signed his letter of intent in February.

I’m about to pen a sentence 
previously unthinkable for a UF student who grew up 
in South Florida supporting the Dolphins. 
(OK, I’m going to “type” it. 
Technology really gets in the way 
of that expression.)
Nick Saban is 100 percent 
right. 
Yeah, I said it. I applaud the 
rigid stance he took against NFL agents and money runners at 
Southeastern Conference Media Days on Wednesday. 
Not all agents, of course, just 
the ones who give active col-lege players money and benefits before their amateur status and scholarships have worn off. 
“I think if an agent does any-
thing to affect the eligibility of a college football player, his license ought to be suspended for a year,” 
Saban said. 
“That’s the only way we’re go-
ing to stop 
what’s hap-pening out 
there because it’s ridiculous and it’s entrapment of young people 
at a very difficult time in their 
life. And it’s very difficult for the institutions and NCAA to control it and it’s very unfair to college 
football.” 
What good is it to punish the 
athlete’s former school by taking 
away wins or ruling the player 
retroactively ineligible?

UF coach Urban Meyer spoke Wednesday at Southeastern Confer-
ence Media Days and addressed allegations surrounding former UF center Maurkice Pouncey, who denied receiving improper benefits. because of a DUI, wide receiver Frankie Hammond Jr. is 
receiving even further punishment.
On Wednesday, Meyer said that Hammond, who was 
expected to compete for playing time at the wide receiver position this season, is current-ly not on the team and has had his scholar-ship taken away. He is expected to return to 
the team, but under different circumstances.
“(Hammond) will have to pay his own 
way and will have to earn a spot like every other person 
who would like to be a member of Florida football,” Meyer said. “There will be playing time taken away from him.” 
when he informed coaches of his intent to 
transfer on Monday.
“My decision to transfer definitely does 
not reflect on the football program or the aca-demics at Cal,” Martin said in a statement re-leased by California.
Martin, who at 6 feet 4 inches and 240 
pounds is listed as a defensive end but could also play linebacker, becomes the 28th mem-ber of the Gators’ highly touted recruiting class, which Rivals.com ranks as No. 2 in the nation.
“I decided to go with what I originally felt was right for me back in recruiting,” Martin 
said in an interview Wednesday. 
Martin said he initially backed away from 
Florida during recruitment because of Urban 
Meyer’s health situation and because former Gators defensive coordinator Charlie Strong 
left Florida to become the head coach at Lou-
isville. 
“That kinda freaked me out when that 
happened so I went with one of my other 
plans and went to Cal,” he said. “But there 
were just distractions at home that I needed to get away from. I’ve been through a lot, and I’ve been to a lot of schools, but I’m blessed to have a second chance and make the most of it now at Florida.”
The decision to transfer to UF brings to a 
conclusion an intriguing, if not odd, recruit-
ing process for Martin that rivals that of Matt Elam, another 2010 recruit who 
changed his mind multiple 
times before finally signing with the Gators.
Martin originally com-
mitted to play for Notre Dame before the beginning 
of his senior season, but visited California in December and decided to decommit from the Fighting Irish. He signed his LOI with the Bears in February before requesting his re-
lease from the school this week and announc-
ing his decision to transfer to UF.
Because he was enrolled at California be-
fore announcing his decision to come to Flor-ida, Martin will have to redshirt this season, 
but will be eligible to play in 2011.
However, when he is eligible for the 
Gators, Martin already has an idea of how he 
will be used on defense.
“The plan is for me to be a hybrid line-
backer and defensive end, kinda in between like the Brandon Spikes role,” Martin said. “That’s the plan for me, but things can change and I’m willing to adapt to that change.”20, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 22, 2010
MEDIA , from page 19
Martin to redshirt, expects to be used in hybrid defensive role in 2011 
RECRUIT , from page 19uations come to light, the football 
player is long gone, going unpun-ished along with the agent who 
broke the rules, and often the law. 
Florida coach Urban Meyer 
supported Saban. 
“On a student-athlete losing 
a season of eligibility or games, 
that’s significant. That affects their livelihood, name, reputation, the school’s reputation,” Meyer said. “The other end of that has to be se-
verely punished, as well.”
It is worth noting that Alabama 
and Florida are currently being in-
vestigated for players — Marcell 
Dareus and Maurkice Pouncey, 
respectively — taking improper benefits from an agent.But this is not a case of sour 
grapes. 
It would be a shame to dismiss 
what these coaches are saying sim-ply because their schools might be perceived as “dirty programs.”
Orlando Sentinel columnist 
Mike Bianchi went as far as to say 
that, for his money, Alabama is 
the most consistent cheater in all of college football over the last 20 years. 
I would argue that the vast ma-
jority of programs break the rules consistently, and it would be near-ly impossible to single Alabama out simply because they have been 
caught the most often. 
But even if that were true about 
Alabama, Saban made a point that 
should be heard and seriously con-
sidered by the NCAA, the NFL and the NFLPA. 
Everyone will remember who 
won that vacated bowl game or returned Heisman regardless of 
whether or not it remains in the record books.
The only real way to stop this 
is to start punishing the agents, 
or even the players once they get 
to the NFL, perhaps suspending them for a few games?
“I don’t think it’s anything but 
greed that is creating it right now on behalf of the agents. Agents that do this, I hate to say this, but how are they any better than a pimp?” Saban asked rhetorically.  
As long postulated by many, 
and eventually confirmed by Dave Chappelle: Pimpin’ ain’t easy. 
Though, these rule-breaking 
agents might beg to differ.KYLE , from page 19
