Three months ago, when the 
meal limit at St Francis House 
was lifted and replaced with a 
meal time, ofﬁ  cials added a po-
lice clearance requirement to use any service at the shelter and soup kitchen. 
While meal time at St. Francis 
House is more peaceful and not as crowded, some believe it has created more opposition in the Gainesville community.
Kent Vann, the executive di-
rector of St. Francis House, said he added the police clearance requirement in his management plan when he asked the city to 
replace a 130-meal limit with a 
three-hour time limit. The St. Francis House serves lunch from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.
“The police clearance require-
ment falls under a safety stand-point,” Vann said. “We needed more accountability when the meal limit was lifted.” 
The policy has created more 
problems instead of solving them, said Joe Jackson, legal skills pro-fessor at UF’s Levin College of Law.

Three people who were injured in a car crash at the 
intersection of University Avenue and Southwest 34th 
Street on Sunday afternoon are recovering.
Riley Sullivan, 20, is in stable condition after hav-
ing surgery at Shands at UF, said Cpl. Angelina Valuri, Gainesville Police spokeswoman. Sullivan has a spinal fracture.
Barry Guertin, 49, and Caline McDermott, 32, were 
taken to North Florida Regional Medical Center after suffering minor injuries in the crash. A GPD news re-lease Sunday afternoon incorrectly stated that four peo-ple were injured in the crash.
Alachua County Fire Rescue Services drove Sullivan 
to Shands at UF with life-threatening injuries, according to Gainesville Police. Gainesville Fire Rescue drove Mc-Dermott to North Florida Medical, and a family member 
took Guertin there.
Guertin and McDermott were treated for injuries in 
the emergency room and released the same day.
The crash happened when Sullivan, driving a silver 
Kia Optima, sped north at around 4:30 p.m. Sunday on Southwest 34th Street toward cars parked in both left-
hand turn lanes. The Optima hit the left rear side of a green Mitsubishi Eclipse and the driver’s side of a silver Chevy Cobalt, according to Gainesville Police.
The Optima continued moving forward, slamming 
into the back of a white Honda Odyssey.Driver in accident

Changes to Student Government’s elec-
tions procedures will be presented at to-
night’s Student Senate meeting. 
The changes come after complications 
with the fall’s new electronic voting sys-tem caused some students to be placed into location-based districts that didn’t re-ﬂ  ect their Gainesville addresses.
In November, Senate President Andy 
Mason formed a specialized committee to examine and modify the rules.
Committee co-chair and Unite Party 
Sen. Katie Waldman said some codes are outdated and apply to paper ballots, not the new electronic ballots. 
For procedure changes to apply to the 
spring elections, the Senate must approve them six weeks before the election cycle, she said. It takes the Senate two weeks to read through the 
changes, and spring elec-
tions are Feb. 21 and 22. 
“We want to accurate-
ly reﬂ  ect the voting sys-
tem we now use,” Wald-
man said. The electronic system was ﬁ  rst used in 
the Fall 2011 elections, and the problems 
with it prompted the UF Supreme Court to investigate the elections process.
Students Party Sen. Carly Wilson at-
tended the committee meetings though she is not a committee member. She said 
she hopes the changes will reﬂ  ect a more 
ﬂ  exible democratic process for individual students. 
“My fear is that the changes will reduce 
what students know about elections,” Wil-son said. Student Senate to present revised elections procedures

Muslim man from Kosovo charged in Tampa bomb plot 
TAMPA — A Kosovo-born 
man was charged with plotting to attack Tampa-area nightclubs and a sheriff’s office with bombs and an assault rifle to avenge wrongs done to Muslims, fed-eral authorities said Monday.
According to a federal com-
plaint, 25-year-old Sami Os-makac recorded an eight-min-ute video shortly before his arrest explaining why he want-ed to bring terror to his “vic-tims’ hearts” in the Tampa Bay iff’s office said Hedrick was arrested Monday and charged with first-degree murder.
Jail records showed Hedrick 
was being held without bond and had a court hearing sched-uled Tuesday.

Beezow Doo-Doo Zopittybop-Bop-Bop arrested in Wisconsin 
MADISON, Wis. — Authori-
ties in southern Wisconsin are 
facing a tongue twister thanks 
to the arrest of Beezow Doo-
Doo Zopittybop-Bop-Bop.
The unusually named 
30-year-old man was in jail 
Sunday in Madison. Police say 
he violated his bail conditions from a previous run-in with the law.
Court records show that his 
name used to be Jeffrey Drew Wilschke. 
He legally changed it in Oc-
tober.
The Capital Times reports 
that Zopittybop-Bop-Bop was arrested last week after resi-dents complained of excessive drinking and drug use near 
Reynolds Park in Madison. Au-
thorities say he was arrested in another local park last April af-ter police found a loaded hand-
gun in his backpack.
He’s tentatively charged 
with carrying a concealed knife 
and possession of drug para-phernalia and marijuana.
Jail records don’t list his bail 
amount or an attorney.
— THE ASSOCIATED PRESSarea. Osmakac is a naturalized 
American citizen.
In the video, Osmakac is 
seen cross-legged on the floor 
with a pistol in his hand and an 
AK-47 behind him. Osmakac said in the video that Muslim blood was more valuable than 
that of people who do not 
believe in Islam. He said he 
wanted “payback” for wrong that was done to Muslims, ac-cording to the complaint.
U.S. Magistrate Judge An-
thony Porcelli ordered Os-makac held without bail. If convicted on the single count of attempted use of a weapon 
of mass destruction, Osmakac 
could face life in prison.
Osmakac was arrested Sat-
urday — the day officials said 
he was planning his attack — 
after he allegedly bought ex-
plosive devices and firearms 
from an undercover agent. The firearms and explosives were disabled before the sale.

Florida sheriff says DNA leads to arrest in cold case 
SANFORD — A central 
Florida sheriff’s office says DNA has helped crack the case in a fatal stabbing that had gone unsolved for about 20 years.
The Seminole County 
Sheriff’s Office tells the Or -
lando Sentinel that it has fi-nally solved the 1991 killing of 50-year-old Betty Clair Foster.
Foster was working alone 
at a computer store near Cas-selberry on Jan. 31, 1991, when she was killed.
The sheriff’s office said

Finance junior Christopher Howard, 21, bowls in the Reitz Union Game Room on Monday night during the Back 
to School Bash event, which featured discounted bowling games for $2 per person.
� STUDENTS COULD 
BOWL FOR $2 A GAME AND PLAY BILLIARDS FOR $3 AN HOUR.
MATT BOLES
Alligator Contributing Writer
While some students 
stood in line to buy textbooks 
or waited for classes to open 
up on ISIS on Monday, others 
enjoyed bowling and playing billiards during the first Back to School Bash at the Reitz 
Union Game Room.
The event lasted from 11 
a.m. to 11:30 p.m.
Students held their cue 
sticks steady at the billiard tables while bowling balls 
crashed into pins just a few yards away. 
Music blared as game 
room employee Chris Car -
rion surveyed the scene.
Carrion, a mathematics ju-
nior, has worked in the game room since this summer. 
He said he thinks it’s cool 
that students can unwind in the game room if they have a 
break during the day.
Regular rates in the game 
room are $3.50 per game per 
person for bowling and $6 
per hour for billiards, but on 
Monday, students bowled $2 games and played billiards for $3 an hour. Students also competed in a trivia tourna-
ment.
Charlotte Dare, manager 
of the game room, said many 
similar events are planned 
for this semester. 
“We’re ramping it up,” 
Dare said. “We want to 
have about two events every month.”  
The next event will be an 
eight-ball tournament  Jan. 21. 
Accounting senior Gzhi 
Xiang was one of the students playing billiards during the event.
He said he likes to play 
about once a week and relax 
in the game room between 
classes. 
“Study hard, play hard,” 
he said. Students bowl, play billiards at Reitz’s Back to School Bash

For the seventh year in a row, UF nabbed the No. 2 
spot on Kiplinger’s Personal Finance’s list of the 100 best 
in-state values in public colleges last week. 
The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill topped 
the rankings, and five other Florida colleges made the list: New College of Florida at No. 5, Florida State University 
at No. 18, University of Central Florida at No. 39, Univer -
sity of North Florida at No. 63 and University of South 
Florida at No. 87.
UF came in at No. 8 for best out-of-state value.
Kiplinger’s ranks colleges by examining factors like 
cost, financial aid, competitiveness, graduation rates and academic support.UF spokesman Steve Orlando said this ranking is good 
news for students and parents.
“People are paying close attention to the value for their 
money, particularly with a lot of talk about the rising cost of public education,” Orlando said. “We’re always mind-
ful of making sure that students are getting the best edu-
cation they can.”
Of the top 10, only UF and New College charge less 
than the national average for in-state students. A year at UF costs a total of $15,526,  and the national average is $17,131, according to Kiplinger’s website.Even UF students who graduate with debt tend to save 
money. 
Orlando said students have an average of about $16,000 
in debt, compared to about $20,000 nationally. 
This is due in part to Bright Futures scholarships and 
the Florida Prepaid College Plan, he said. 
Applied physiology and kinesiology sophomore Se-
bastien Goodman, 20, said cost was a big factor when he 
chose UF. He said he takes out about $3,000 in loans each 
semester and also receives money from Bright Futures.
“For undergraduate education, why wouldn’t I try to 
be more cost efficient?” he said.
Goodman said he thinks UF’s value could improve by 
lowering the current student-faculty ratio of 21-1. 
Orlando said the university is working to improve that 
number.UF’s in-state tuition considered second-best value in US

A Shands at UF employee was arrested 
at work Friday night on domestic battery 
charges.
When Tiffany P. Hobdy told Benjamin T. 
Lewis on Friday she could not return rent money to him, their argument turned vio-lent, according to a Gainesville Police re-port. Lewis pushed Hobdy onto a bed and 
began to choke her. The confrontation took 
place in the Cobblestone Apartments com-plex on Northwest 23rd Boulevard.
Lewis was arrested at Shands at 8:47 
p.m. Friday. He was charged with prevent-ing Hobdy from talking to law enforcement 
and domestic battery by choking her, both 
third-degree felonies. He was also charged with resisting a police officer without vio-lence, a first-degree misdemeanor.
Lewis and Hobdy have lived together on 
and off for about two years. The couple has a 2-year-old daughter together, Lewis said.
During the couple’s argument, Hobdy 
threatened to call 911, but Lewis snatched the phone and threw it downstairs, accord-ing to the arrest report. The two scrambled 
for the phone, but Lewis got to it first. He then 
snapped the phone in 
half.
Officer Daniel Beans 
found a TV and a DVD player smashed on the 
floor. He later found Lewis at Shands, where 
he works as a linen technician. The report states that Lewis told Beans he was actually a security guard, but Lewis said Monday he did not mislead the officer.
“This is all news to me, man,” Lewis 
said. “What you’re seeing is what I’m see-
ing. I don’t know why they’re saying I’m a 
security guard.”
Before he was arrested, Lewis confirmed 
to Beans he had pushed Hobdy on the bed and “hemmed her up,” according to the re-
port. He also said he took Hobdy’s phone 
after she threatened to call the police. 
On Monday, Lewis said he never gave a 
statement prior to his arrest.Shands employee arrested, charged with domestic battery

Even if UF students aren’t satisfied with their academic ex-
perience, at least they enjoy the atmosphere. 
The 2011 Student Experience in the Research University 
survey showed UF ranked second of eight participating peer 
universities in student satisfaction with the social experience 
and with a feeling of belonging at the campus.However, UF ranked fifth in students’ satisfaction with their 
academic experience.
UF had the highest SERU response rate at 63 percent, 26 
percentage points higher than the next-highest, the University 
of Southern California. 
Jen Day Shaw, assistant vice president of student affairs and 
dean of students, said the reason for the high response rate was UF’s marketing strategies, which included tying season foot-ball ticket registration to completion of the survey . 
Marketing SERU to students is important because the data 
gives insight into the state of the undergraduate Student Body , 
Shaw said. 
The survey was designed to identify effective academic 
practices on campus and areas for improvement. 
“If you’re going to complain, make sure your voice is 
heard,” she said. “Make sure you fill it out.”SERU survey: UF students happy with campus experienceLewis

The Gator name will not be a 
part of the adult entertainment 
industry — at least for the next 
10 years. 
UF paid a one-time fee of 
$200 per name to block 17 trade-
marked names, including Gator 
Nation, Gators, Rowdy Reptiles 
and University of Florida, from being purchased as .xxx domain names. The university addition-ally purchased OrangeandBlue.
xxx because it is not a university-
owned trademark.
 Websites with the .xxx suffix, 
which went on sale to the pub-
lic in December, are reserved for 
adult entertainment.
The university spent about 
$3,600 total, said Janine Sikes, spokeswoman for UF. 
In order to block the names, 
the university had to prove it had a registered trademark and pro-vide the date of the trademark. By blocking the adult-oriented .xxx domain names, UF ensured no one else can purchase them 
for the next 10 years. 
“UF did not wants its name 
or any of its trademark names to be used with inappropriate con-
tent,” Sikes said. 
She said UF plans to do noth-
ing with the domain names.

� NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS ARE HELPING THE 
TOWN, WHICH EXPERIENCED ABOUT 18 FEET OF SNOW.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ANCHORAGE, Alaska — Dozens of National Guard 
troops have arrived to help an Alaska fishing town dig out from massive snows that have collapsed roofs, trapped 
some people in homes and triggered avalanches.
The Guard reported more than 18 feet of snow has 
fallen in the past weeks, although the National Weather Service did not immediately have a measurement.
Officials said at least three buildings have collapsed or 
partially collapsed and six homes are deemed in risk of collapse by heavy, wet snow.
The town issued a disaster proclamation last week after three weeks of relentless snow overwhelmed local crews working around the clock and filled snow dump sites.
Responders said Sunday that rain fell overnight, mak-
ing for a slippery, treacherous mess in the Prince William Sound community of 2,000 year-round residents. The region has been pummeled by snow, but Cordova is of 
particular concern because there is no road access to the 
town, only boat and plane passage, said Maj. Gen. Thomas Katkus, adjutant general of the Alaska National Guard.Alaska town tries to dig itself out from under huge snow dump “I don’t know if other 
people would be dis-
turbed by it, but I’m 
happy a porn website

Occupational licensing 
goes too far  
If you have ever thought of one day becoming an interior 
designer, you need to move the hell away from Florida. 
Florida is one of three states that requires you to obtain 
a license to give interior design consulting and advice. 
This is not a joke. If you want to help people figure out 
which colors best accentuate their new bedroom set, you have to go through a long and arduous process to give this advice 
for a living. 
According to the National Law Journal, to obtain an inte-
rior design license in Florida, “an applicant must first com-
plete a combined six years of post-secondary education and apprenticeship under a state-licensed interior designer and 
pass a state-mandated exam administered by a private testing 
body.” 
If someone practices as an interior designer without going 
through this process, he or she could be punished with a first-degree misdemeanor, up to a year in jail and about $1,000 in 
fines. 
Occupational licensing for careers in interior design, hair -
styling or ballroom dance studio operating (no, that’s not a 
joke) is clearly an absurd use of government power. 
Not using a licensed interior designer might not make your 
home look like something off of HGTV , but there can’t seri-ously be a concern for public safety, can there? 
The other 47 states run wild with unlicensed interior de-
signers and, much to the chagrin of Florida lawmakers, things 
seem to be going just fine. 
So what is the real reason for these absurd occupational li-
censing requirements? 
The simple answer is that professionals already established 
in the industry want to prevent competition from entering the market. 
Clark Neily, an attorney at the Institute for Justice, called 
the push for occupational licenses a “virulent cartelization ef-
fort.” 
It is no coincidence that licensing boards are generally made 
up of people already in the industry. The less competition, the more business current interior designers can receive. 
But your right to suggest the proper length of drapes is not 
the biggest issue. Of even greater importance is the fact that 
various industries are using the government to prevent you 
from doing what you want to do. 
If people are voluntarily paying you for your decorating 
advice, what business is it of the state that you are “properly” 
trained? With the Internet and various websites like Angie’s 
List, which rate the quality of various service providers, why 
do we turn to the government to “protect” us? 
By keeping out competition with occupational licensing 
laws, consumers end up being hurt the most, facing higher prices and fewer choices. Technology undermines retained knowledge
Years ago I thought I was smart because I could name most of the state capitals, I knew the difference be-tween a peach and a nectarine, and I could discern 
a Pink Floyd sample from that of Led Zeppelin. Granted, none of these really indicated my intellect. But I thought my knowledge would increase exponentially until the day my hair grayed, at which time my clarity would dampen as my experiences compounded. 
Reality, however, is far from what I’d imagined. At 
21, I find myself struggling to recall the simplest facts or thoughts I’d had the day before. While I don’t record mes-sages to myself like Polaroids, I at least expect to remem-ber a person’s name, a passage I’ve read or how to cook rice. Instead, I find myself referring to the brain outside of my brain: my smartphone. Where I used to depend on the sharpness of my recollection, I now depend on the reliabil-ity of my connection.
Presumably, I’m not alone — consider the number of 
students you see marching across campus glued to their portable devices of choice. It’s reasonable to assume that at some point we will, or we have, become habituated to en-trusting these devices to contain all the information we will ever want and ever need, our minds no longer burdened with the task of remembering bits of information. Even vital life skills (how to cook, how to clean, how to find a g-spot) are abandoned to a search on our smartphones. Each ad-ditional feature steadily depletes our standard for intelli-gence. Just ask Siri. If she understands you, that is.
Of the many fields that are crippling due to the dissolu-
tion of retained knowledge, civic duty seems to be the most handicapped. I hope, though I won’t bet, that most UF stu-dents know the name of some of the more controversial acts to recently float and trudge through Washington. 
I hope, though I won’t bet, that most UF students can 
recite at least some of the amendments in the Bill of Rights. Failure to do so and referring to your smartphone for the answers seems to render that device more “American” than its user, despite it being made in China or South Korea. If we have the audacity to call ourselves Americans, we should have the same knowledge and under -
standing of the first 10 amend-ments as Christians should of the Ten Commandments.
Now, some may say that the 
majority of citizens have never 
known such specifics about the laws and workings of their country. Why should we be held to this standard today? True, we have not, but citizens have also never had such access to these specifics (just one of the great benefits of this hand-held technology.) 
Citizens of the past also lacked significant free time. 
While their days were spent in the field or in the factory, ours are spent on the couch, watching reality TV and mas-turbating, too often simultaneously. We should be held to this standard of awareness because every time we insensi-bly surf the Internet, we abandon our responsibility and ne-gate a chance to participate in the future, in the well-being of our world and in the well-being of ourselves.
I don’t intend to undermine the countless benefits 
technology provides. Nor do I intend to save myself from blame. In fact, I accuse myself of this lethargic complacency while trying to uphold the responsible use of technology in our hands. 
And though I’m aware of the National Defense Autho-
rization Act and can even list the Ten Commandments as a non-Christian, I admit that the full extent of the Bill of Rights escapes me. However, as integrity demands, be-fore this is published I will restudy these amendments by recording them onto paper while reading them from my smartphone.

UF Alert needs quicker, better response
As a female student who lives in the Soror -
ity Row area, many of my friends and I have 
felt very nervous about being in Gainesville because of the recent crimes that have oc-curred around campus at night. One idea I 
have which might help ease some of this con-
cern is improving the timeliness of the emer -
gency notifications being sent to us.
Following the sexual battery that occurred 
Nov. 29, I never received an emergency text message to my phone, and I was not sent an email informing me of the incident until 9:35 a.m., more than seven hours after the time the 911 call was made, according to the email. UF Alert was inconsistent in that it later 
sent an email informing us of the attacker’s identity , but the message had no follow-up alert on his actual arrest, an event many would have been relieved to hear about. For the sex-ual battery attempt Dec. 9, the emergency no-tification system was quicker to respond, but 
the text message still did not get out until more 
than an hour after the incident occurred, with the attacker still at large and quite possibly still in the area. I know people who walked near that area during that time with absolutely no knowledge of any potential danger. 
In addition, I have learned about other lo-
cal crimes this semester not from Emergency Management, but from alternate sources, including members of the University Police and local newspapers. Some even occurred between the two attempted sexual battery in-cidents, notably an assault and robbery that also took place around Sorority Row. Why are students informed of campus power outages 
during Thanksgiving Break but not of a seri-
ous crime such as this one? While UF is by no means responsible for any of these criminal ac-tions, the university does have a responsibility to ensure the safety of its students. 
The emergency notification system, if used 
efficiently and frequently , can be instrumental in keeping students instantaneously aware of potential dangers in their area. If “emergency” messages are not issued in a timely manner, they do not serve much purpose to us at all.
I am really hoping that this problem can be 
improved for future responses to UF-related emergencies. I encourage everyone, male or female, to look after themselves and each oth-
er, sign up for Rape Aggression Defense class-
es and continue to submit feedback to UF’s Emergency Management staff to help make the UF campus and surrounding areas feel a little safer for all those who live there.

The United States is in the midst of the most severe jobs crisis since the Great Depression. Policy decisions made in Washington during 
the last three years have exacerbated this crisis by in-creasing economic uncertainty. It is imperative that 
the next president understand the nature of the prob-
lem and be willing to rectify the situation.
The national unemployment rate — which fell 
from 10.1 percent in October 2009 to 8.5 percent last month — understates how severe the jobs crisis really is. An unemployed person who can’t find work and decides to stop looking for a job is no longer consid-ered “unemployed” according to official statistics. If it weren’t for the large numbers of people who have 
simply given up looking for a job during the last few 
years, the unemployment rate would be around 11 percent.
It gets worse: Since President Obama took office, 
the average duration of unemployment has sky-rocketed from about 20 weeks to about 40 weeks. 
For comparison, this number has never been more 
than 22 weeks since at least the Great Depression. This poses a significant problem, as many workers’ skills atrophy while they are unemployed. The longer someone is unemployed, the less employable he or she becomes. The harm caused by this crisis will be with us for years to come.
But why is the jobs crisis so severe? In many situations, a business’s decision to hire 
or invest is difficult to reverse. Thus, when there is uncertainty pertaining to the costs or benefits of this decision, a business will often postpone the decision in order to wait for more information. 
University of Stanford economists Scott Baker and 
Nicholas Bloom and University of Chicago economist Steven Davis recently constructed an index of poli-cy-induced economic uncertainty. Not surprisingly, this index spiked during the financial crisis. How-ever, unlike after other crises, uncertainty has not returned to its normal levels. Instead, throughout the entire Obama presidency the level of policy-
induced uncertainty has remained consistently about double its average over the previous 25 years. The blame largely lies with recently enacted legislation as well as uncertainty about future regulations. As a result, businesses have postponed many decisions to invest and hire until they know more about their future financial and health care costs. Baker, Bloom and Davis calculate that, if the level of policy-induced economic uncertainty were to return to its 2006 level, 
the economy would add 2.5 million jobs.
In order to put the nation back to work, we need a 
president who is focused on creating jobs, not a presi-
dent who is intent on not letting, as Rahm Emanuel said, “a serious crisis go to waste.” Unfortunately, most of the Republican presidential candidates seem 
little better than President Obama on this count — 
they, too, seem primarily interested in implementing their legislative and regulatory agendas, regardless of the effects that this may have on the jobs crisis.
The obvious exception is Mitt Romney. His past 
executive experiences — at Bain Capital, the Salt Lake City Olympics and as governor of Massachusetts — have shown him to be a pragmatic problemsolver rather than an ideologue with an agenda. His choice 
of economic advisors — Harvard’s Greg Mankiw 
and Columbia’s Glenn Hubbard, both well-respected economists — bears out this fact. Romney seems to be the candidate who best understands the link be-tween policy decisions in Washington and the jobs crisis, and is thus in the best position to rectify the problem.
Jonathan Pedde is a columnist for The Dartmouth at 
Dartmouth College.Obama admin should focus on jobsUWireWhat’s the trouble 
with America? The answers to this 
question lie boldly in what defines the lives of ordinary 
Americans, what the new 
cool prefer to call the 99 per -
cent. Commonplace answers, however, seem uncommon to American politicians — a number of whom belong in the high-tower 1 percent. It is numbing, to say it kindly, that America is swamped in com -
mon trouble.
Sometimes the solution to 
a problem that borrows age-old wisdom remains mostly when that problem is present-ing itself. The exact nature of the matter tends to be lost on most people. In such a case, we are well aware of our trou-bles, but we are drowning in them anyway.
As we wrap up 2011 and 
surge into the year of elec-tions, there is no trace of hope that our problems could be cushioned. That the crumbling economy could be saved. That the heavy burden of debt vis-
ited on students could be sear -
ing to oblivion. That disgraced 
homeowners could once again find some dignity. That mil-lions scouting for jobs could wake up to something. That everyone could get affordable health care. 
What really is upsetting 
is that there’s no reason why hope should be taken away from people in a country 
where anything is possible. 
There’s no reason why poli-ticians should have the last word on how to fix these problems. And there’s just no reason why Americans should be beholden to a political or -
ganization that sits at odds with reality.
The Republican presiden-
tial nomination campaigns paint the gloom. The candi-dates offer that, even though the plight of ordinary folk is genuinely poor and thus begs for attention, there’s nothing significant that politics and politicians can offer in the 
gridlock.
No one who promises to fix Amer -
i c a ’ s 
prob-l e m s as its 
commander-in-chief should wear a mask that blinds him or her from the panorama that is the glaring predicament of many. And these candidates have not disappointed in their sorry disconnect to the country’s realities. Americans know what ails America, but 
its leaders don’t.
It is overly wounding that 
there is hardly concession 
from most politicians that the Occupy protests are a sincere gesture of the burden that their actions have visited on hardworking and innocent Americans. Yet these placard-waving Americans whom one Republican favorite, Newt Gingrich, has dismissed as 
filthy and needing of a show-
er, are genuinely angry.
Occupy seems to have 
shed light not only on the in-equalities of America’s finan-cial system, but also on the 
confusion of its political class. 
The Occupy movement’s lack of potential villains has meant that Republicans’ usual tactic of meeting protests with scorn for their methods has led them into some ridiculous trouble.
And though some Demo-
crats have seen familiarity in the Occupiers’ cause, which so clearly chimes with their own political values, they 
have been reluctant to jump 
in and stand with Americans. Theirs is a misplaced strat-egy hemmed on caution and has thus kept them from the campers’ arguments directly.
They’ve only managed a 
halfhearted acknowledgment of Occupy’s aims, and that  
illustrates their current in-
ability to freely confront the issues with which they are being presented. That said, Americans continue to be in trouble as long as we look up to the two-party dictatorship for hope and solutions.

The first time Bryan Agostini 
gave blood, he went with a group 
of friends when a collection truck came to his high school.
Now, the 21-year-old psychol-
ogy junior is alone, staring out the back window when the monitor of the ALYX blood sorting machine starts beeping, signaling low pres-
sure.
Agostini looks concerned.
“Need you to squeeze, buddy,” 
one of the technicians said, point-ing to the stress ball in Agostini’s 
left hand.
The 10.8 fluid ounces of blood 
Agostini donated, as a part of Na-
tional Blood Donor Month, will go to a nearby hospital. 
Blood donation buses will be 
parked by Century Tower and on the North Lawn next to the Mar -
ston Science Library every day this week and the week of Jan. 23 from 
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The North Lawn 
bus also will be on campus Jan. 17 
and 18.
“We always have a need for 
blood. O negative and any type 
of B are always hard to get,” said 
Kyle Boyton, a LifeSouth donor 
services specialist. “We can never get enough of those.”
UF students provide between 
30 and 40 percent of the blood do-nated in the North Central Florida region, providing a vital tool for Shands at UF and the other major hospitals in the area.
“Nine times out of 10, the blood 
will go to a trauma or a transplant patient,” said Conrad Perez, Life-South mobile team leader and Gainesville firefighter. “A liver transplant might take as many as 
45 units.” 
A standard unit of blood is 
about 500 mL (17 fluid ounces), 
Perez said, but since Agostini is type O, his blood is being filtered 
into a concentrated amount, due to 
its high demand.
Agostini squeezes and releases 
his hand, and more blood drifts 
into the buzzing machine as it sorts his red blood cells and re-moves plasma, which will be in-jected back into his body with a saline solution. 
As the plasma and sa-
line are pushed back, Agos-tini can feel it move up his arm. “I can see my vein pulsing with the machine when it returns,” Agostini said. “It feels kind of weird.”
After about 30 minutes, Agos-
tini left with a new pair of flannel boxers, some crackers and a box of Gatorade.
Despite the odd feeling of the 
plasma in its re-entry and his un-ease with the noisy machine, Ago-stini said he’ll donate again.
“If they can get this machine 
to stop beeping,” he said, “then it would all be worth it.”8, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, JANUARY 10, 2012

� MOST DRIVERS SPEND 
LESS THAN 30 MINUTES   DRIVING.

Gainesville has been ranked 
by an Orlando newspaper as 
the city with the shortest com-
muting times in Florida.
About 86 percent of 
Gainesville drivers spend less than half an hour on the road, 
and about 43 percent spend less than 15 minutes driving, according to data published by the Orlando Business Journal 
on Thursday. The paper ana-
lyzed data from the five-year version of the 2009 American Community Survey conducted 
by the U.S. Census Bureau.
The paper named Gainesville 
19th out of 269 major U.S. cities 
in terms of commuting time.
Gainesville Mayor Craig 
Lowe attributed the ranking to the success of Smartraffic, a countywide traffic manage-ment system.
Philip Mann, city traffic 
operations manager, said the system lets his staff keep an eye on city streets. If one gets too congested, they can change the 
traffic lights to let traffic flow.
He said his staff members 
also tweet the locations of traf-
fic accidents and update a map of the city on gac-smartraffic.com with crashes.
Construction on the traffic 
system started in 2007, Mann said. 
The last stage, which in-
cludes adding neighboring 
towns into the system, is due to 
be finished by October.
“The report just substanti-
ates what we’ve been trying to do,” he said. “We try to get 
the info out so people can make 
smarter choices.”Gainesville drivers’

With no patriotic parades and 
little fanfare on either side of the At-
lantic Ocean, the Iraq War is done.
On Dec. 15, the Iraq War ended 
after eight years and 273 days.
After the war that took almost 
nine years, 4,487 American lives and more than $800 billion, Americans didn’t celebrate with raised flags or iconic folk songs as they did with the conclusions of past wars.
“Increasingly, the American pub-
lic turned against the war toward the end,” said David Hedge, a UF 
political science professor.
He said the war was more of an 
issue seven years ago than it was even three years ago.
“Now, the Iraq War isn’t so much 
in the political arena,” Hedge said.
He said he guesses Americans 
looking back will have a negative 
view of the war, just like those who lived through the 1960s and ‘70s view the Vietnam War.
“This war is seen as the same 
quagmire as Vietnam, where we pursued the wrong foreign policies 
for the wrong reasons,” Hedge said.
Some students have strong opin-
ions about the Iraq War.
“It’s still not completely over,” 
said Rebecca Fonseca, a 20-year-old 
health science junior at UF.
She said her uncle, a 20-year 
chaplain in the military , missed Christmas and his first granddaugh-ter’s first birthday this year because he was deployed in Afghanistan.
Fonseca said she doesn’t think 
the war is over if there are people 
still serving in combat overseas. She 
said Iraq was only one facet of the larger conflict.
Matt Inman, a 24-year-old me-
chanical engineering graduate sec-ond-year at UF, said the war’s end-ing is a big deal.
“It’s strange because we weren’t 
fighting a nation,” Inman said.
He said he thinks it is interest-
ing more people don’t serve in the military.
The reason more don’t serve in 
the military is probably because the college population is so great, he said.
“The military isn’t as common an 
option as it was back then,” Inman 
said.Students react to end of Iraq War

GPD checks for outstanding warrants
type infractions that lead to people having difficul-
ty getting police clearance,” Jackson said. “People have this perception that all homeless people are 
dangerous. They’re not.”
In order to get police clearance, people must go 
to the Gainesville Police Department and show a 
form of identification. GPD then checks to make 
sure there is not a warrant out for their arrest and 
gives out a clearance slip, Vann said. These police clearances need to be renewed each month.
Gainesville resident George Mack said the policy 
causes too much of a hassle because it requires a 
trip to the police station. “There has to be another, more efficient way to 
make this place safe,” said Mack, 22. 
Two policemen are at the soup kitchen twice a 
month to give out police clearances, Vann said. He 
did this to make it easier for people to get clear -
ances.
Gainesville resident Nina McNeal said she has 
been coming to eat at St. Francis House almost ev-ery day since 1992. In those 20 years, the 59-year-old said she has never felt as safe while she eats her lunch as she does now. 
“It keeps all of the riffraff out,” McNeal said as 
she ate her rice and beans. “Sorry they may not be able to eat, but that’s their problem. They should have behaved.”mEALS , from page 1“We try to get the info

manager� UF RAS RECEIVE A 
SEMESTER STIPEND RANG-ING FROM $1,404 TO $3,096.
ALLI LANGLEY
Alligator Writer
Students are settling into their 
dorms this week, and UF’s resi-
dent assistants are back on the job.
Some RAs make more than oth-
ers at Florida public universities, where compensation ranges from free housing to about $2,500 for a semester.
At UF, RAs receive a semester 
stipend that ranges from $1,404 to $3,096, said Lisa Diekow, director of Housing for Residence Life and Education. The amount depends 
on how many semesters of experi-
ence the RAs have and the number of residents they supervise.
Those in their second year who 
manage more than 25 residents receive $2,952 a semester. RAs with 25 or fewer students receive a smaller stipend, but almost all of the 183 RAs supervise 26 to 65 stu-
dents, said Scott Francis, associate 
director of Housing for Residence Life and Education.
RAs also receive a $300 dining 
credit each semester, and “when occupancy allows,” Diekow said, they live in a single room and pay the double-room rate, which var -
ies among the residence halls.
One former RA said he thought RAs are undercompensated.
“To be the person they want 
you to be, they don’t give you what you deserve,” said Camilo Buscaron, 22, computer engineer -ing senior.
He said that student athletes 
and graduate teaching assistants receive help with tuition and sug-gested the housing department help RAs in the same way.
At FSU, RAs are paid $7.92 an 
hour for about 20 hours of work each week, which totals about $2,500 a semester, said Stacie Kurlick, the assistant director of University Housing at FSU.
RAs get $300 in dining credit 
and pay the double-room rate for a single room, just like at UF. However, they also receive a 50 percent discount on housing. The value of the discount ranges from about $1,000 to about $1,500.
Kurlick said RAs at FSU also get 
a 10 percent bookstore discount.
At UCF, RAs are compensated 
for 15 hours a week at $7.31 an hour, about $1,700 a semester. They also receive a 70 to 80 per -
cent discount on housing.
At the main USF campus in 
Tampa, RAs receive free housing and a meal plan with 13 meals a week, according to the USF hous-
ing 
At USF’s St. Petersburg cam-
pus, RAs receive about $2,600 a se-
mester and a 50 percent discount on housing, said Heather Klisa-nin, the assistant director of Resi-dential Education and Housing at USF’s St. Petersburg campus.
At UF, the budget for the hous-
ing department comes from rent, Francis said, and the last time RA compensation changed was the 2010 spring semester, when sti-pends increased by $180.
Devin Donohue, a UF alumnus, 
said he became an RA so he could make his hall more than a place students sleep.
“Kids who are RAs are not do-
ing it for the compensation,” said 
Donohue, 23. TUESDAY, JANUARY 10, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 9

� FLORIDA PLAYS GEORGIA 
TONIGHT AT 7 AT HOME. 
JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Staff Writer
 
Florida coach Billy Donovan 
does not have to stretch his vo-
cabulary when his team is lacking 
defensive intensity.
After dropping two games in 10 
days to unranked opponents and 
allowing a .500 Tennessee team to 
hit half of its shots, there was little 
need for semantics when describ-ing how Florida played during its most recent road loss.
“Whatever words you want to 
use in the Tennessee game, ‘flat,’ ‘uninspired,’ ‘step-slow,’ whatever the word is — we were that team,” Donovan said.  “We did not play, 
in my opinion, with the level of en-
ergy that we needed to.”
Though No. 19 Florida (12-4, 0-1 
Southeastern Conference) also suf-fered through a woeful, 20-for-56 
shooting performance in its league 
opener, the emphasis for Donovan and his players ahead of tonight’s home tilt at 7 against Georgia (9-6, 
0-1 SEC) has been defense.
The Volunteers shot 51 percent 
from the floor and hit 50 percent of 
their 3-pointers Saturday. Tennes-see’s field goal percentage was the 
highest the Gators have permitted 
all season, leaving freshman guard Brad Beal to characterize Florida as looking “slow and lazy” at times.  
“We didn’t play hard at all, ba-
sically,” Beal said. “We didn’t play great help defense, we weren’t guarding the ball well (and) our Emphasis on defense as UGA comes to O’Dome

The Gators have dropped the ball to start 
the new year.
In three Southeastern Conference games, 
Florida has recorded 61 turnovers and lost 
at home to No. 9 Kentucky and No. 24 South 
Carolina by a combined eight points.
The slow start stems from the Gators’ 
sloppiness with the basketball in the first half since league play began on New Year’s Day.
“We’ve not gotten out of the gates well, 
and that’s really baffling,” coach Amanda Butler said. “We need to be sharper from the 
onset.”
The Gators’ most recent loss came against 
the Gamecocks in a 49-44 defeat that was de-
cided in the final minutes. However, a five-
point loss was far from expected after UF 
turned the ball over 14 times and scored just 
15 points in the first half. 
Florida has averaged 20.3 giveaways per 
game since SEC play began compared to a 16.5 mark in 13 non-conference contests.
Even junior forward Jennifer George — the 
Gators’ leading scorer — has struggled with ball control from the get-go, recording nine 
first-half turnovers in her last three games.
“You can’t afford — even if it’s five ticks 
into the game — to give the ball back because then you’re giving yourself the chance to lose 
by two right there,” Butler said.
Giveaways were a pressing issue for the 
Gators last season when they added six new players to the fold.
The unfamiliarity within the team contrib-
uted to Florida’s minus-1.23 turnover margin during the 2010-11 campaign, which ranked next to last in the Southeastern Conference.
While the Gators are in the black with a 
plus-1.38 mark this season, they still rank just eighth in the conference.
Senior guard Deana Allen believes that 
maintaining Florida’s game plan from the start  will help it minimize giveaways.Slow starts, 
turnovers lead to early SEC 
woes for UF

Prized defensive end Jordan Jenkins 
continued the stay-at-home streak es-
tablished by many top recruits in the 
class of 2012 on Monday — the four-
star prospect chose Georgia over Flori-da, Alabama and Auburn in a televised interview with the Fox Sports South 
network.Jenkins’ oral commitment to Geor -
gia was a huge miss 
for UF, which could have used his tested pass rush ability and 
disruptive strength at 
defensive end, where 
the Gators are cur -
rently extremely thin. 
Now, coach Will 
Muschamp and his staff will focus on another recruit deciding between Flor -ida and Georgia in five-star prospect Josh Harvey-Clemons, as well as five-star defensive end Darius Hamilton of Ramsey, N.J.
However, Florida had a huge grab 
Saturday night when five-star defen-sive end Jonathan Bullard orally com-mitted at the U.S. Army All-America 
game. 
The Shelby, N.C., prospect chose the 
Gators over Clemson and South Caro-
lina, among others.

Maegan Dennis / Alligator StaffSeven members of 2012 class enroll early
Florida heading into 2012, as Ron-
ald Powell is the only remaining experienced pass-rushing end on 
the Gators’ roster. 
Bullard’s explosiveness off 
the ball and 6-foot-4, 255-pound 
frame have improved over the 
course of his final high school 
season, and he could compete for immediate playing time next season. 
Early enrollees on campus: 
Fresh off of the U.S. Army and Under Armour All-America games, seven new freshmen navi-gated the UF campus for the first 
time as students Monday.
Seven spring enrollees from 
the recruiting class of 2012 be-
gan classes, in hopes of gaining an advantage with a full semes-
ter finished — and a playbook 
memorized — by the time they are joined by fellow 2012 recruits during the  summer.
Three-star cornerback Willie 
Bailey of Hallandale; four-star of-fensive lineman Jessamen Dunker of Boynton Beach; three-star de-fensive end Quinteze Williams of Tyrone, Ga.; four-star linebacker Antonio Morrison from Boling-
book, Ill.; four-star wide receiver 
Latroy Pittman of Citra; five-star offensive tackle D.J. Humphries of Charlotte, N.C.; and junior 
college defensive tackle transfer 
Damien Jacobs all had their first days at UF Monday.
These seven have helped pro-
pel Muschamp’s first full recruit-
ing class to No. 3 nationally, ac-
cording to Rivals.com. 
Currently at 18 recruits — 
near the NCAA-mandated limit 
of 25 per signing class — this 
class could be officially spliced in order to sign seven extra play-ers, with the seven early enroll-ees being counted toward 2011’s 
18-member class.
Salt decommits: Florida lost 
top junior college transfer Visesio 
Salt out of Walnut, Cal. Monday 
night. 
Salt, a 6’3” 340-pound four-
star defensive tackle, switched 
his oral commitment from Flori-da to Utah Monday night.  
Oral commitments are nonbind-
ing until a national letter of intent is signed on or after National Signing Day on Feb. 1, 2012.RecR uit , from page 14
“We can’t let other teams 
dictate how we’re going to 
execute our plays,” Allen said. 
“Just learning to dictate our own tempo and also just valu-
ing the ball.”
The Gators’ failure to es-
tablish substantial offensive production down low has 
contributed to the turnover problem. 
Due to inconsistent post 
play, Florida’s guards have been more aggressive driving 
the lane, leading to increased 
mistakes. 
George has certainly done 
her part in the paint, leading UF with 14 points and 10.1 rebounds per game, but post 
scoring begins and ends with 
her.
The closest forward or 
center to George statistically is senior Azania Stewart, av-eraging 5.3 points and 5.6 re-
bounds per contest.
Following the South Caro-lina game, George said her 
fellow post players needed to “finish consistently with con-
tact” offensively.
Butler sent a message to the 
forwards and centers that they needed to get more involved 
and described them as “very, very capable” of doing so.
“Ndidi (Madu) got us out 
of the gates against Kentucky — that’s what we need from 
her,” Butler said.  “Lily (Svete) 
is out of her shooting slump. We need her to play both ends 
of the floor.”
Florida’s next game will be 
a road tilt against No. 19 Geor -
gia on Thursday at 7 p.m.
The Gators posted a 1-1 re-
cord against the Bulldogs last season, recording 16 and 23 
turnovers in the win and loss, respectively.
“The way we feel about the 
SEC, each ball game is going to be won or lost by two or may-
be three possessions,” Butler 
said. “You’ve got to value the ball when you have it.”

Donovan ramps up intensity as Florida prepares for Georgia
transition defense wasn’t good. 
We’ve had too many breakdowns during the game and it really cost 
us.”
  The Bulldogs, who average 62.9 
points per game, aren’t known 
as an offensive-minded squad. 
But, then again, neither were the 
Volunteers before their efﬁ  cient, 11-point win.
  Since Dec. 29, Florida has al-
lowed four unranked teams to 
shoot a combined 44.8 percent 
from the ﬁ  eld and 42.4 percent from three. In their ﬁ  rst 12 games, the Gators allowed opponents to 
shoot 40.9 from the ﬁ  eld and just 
29.5 percent from beyond the arc.  
UF is now tied with the College 
of Charleston, Wofford, Northern Illinois and Tulsa for the 138th-
best ﬁ  eld goal defense in the coun-
try at 41.9 percent. 
  “It has not been the same since 
before Christmas,” Donovan said. 
“The only two guys, in my opin-
ion, who understand what this is all about are (Erving) Walker and (Kenny) Boynton because they have been through it. (Patric) Young, (Erik) Murphy and Beal – those guys are somewhat new to what this is all about and what is 
going on.”
  Murphy, a 6-foot-10 junior for-
ward, said that after UF beat FSU 
82-64 on Dec. 22, defense took a back seat in practice as injuries 
and sickness forced four Gators to 
miss time. 
  “We lost that mentality a little 
bit,” said Murphy, who had a ca-
reer-high four blocks against Ten-
nessee. “I think we’re going to do our best. Working out in practice [Sunday] was really good, espe-cially in those areas — defense and 
rebounding.”
  Florida practiced twice on 
Sunday and, according to Beal 
and Murphy, never made a shot. 
Instead, Donovan placed plastic 
bubbles over the court’s hoops to make sure the team’s defensive toughness was addressed. Both players described the practices as 
their most physical of the season.
  “Sometimes we get emotion-
ally down on ourselves and down 
on one another,” Beal said. “And I 
really think that we need to grow 
up. We need to grow up a lot and just basically ﬁ  ght through adver-sity.”
