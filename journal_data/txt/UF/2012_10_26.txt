 Florida coach Will Muschamp approached 
the podium in his typical business-like manner 
on Oct. 29, 2011. He delivered his initial post-game comments before opening the ﬂ  oor for questions.
  There was talk of missed opportunities. 
There was talk of numbers.
  Georgia scored two touchdowns on fourth 
downs and nearly added a third on the ﬁ  nal play of the game. The Bulldogs ran out the clock on the Gators’ 1-yard line.
  During the second half, Georgia amassed 
nearly 21 minutes of possession. The Bulldogs’ last drive burned the ﬁ  nal 5:32.
  The Gators had minus-19 rushing yards and 
gave away 106 yards on penalties. UF lost the turnover battle for a fourth straight game.
  Perhaps most glaring was Florida’s new 
place in history.   The loss to the Bulldogs marked the Gators’ ﬁ  rst four-game losing streak since 1988. Florida had not endured a four-game skid against Southeastern Conference foes since 1979, its last season with a losing record.
  The numbers dragged Muschamp down, 
but he never wavered. Unlike his demeanor on the sidelines, Muschamp’s preparation is on an even keel.   
He never ﬂ  uctuates. He stays the course.  Muschamp knew the process would not 
yield overnight success.
  “I don’t really think about losing a whole 
lot,” Muschamp said after last season’s loss to Georgia. “But obviously, it’s happened, so we’ve got to regroup and reevaluate where we are. We need to move forward. It’s disappoint-ing, and there’s no one more disappointed or impatient in it than I am. So, we’ve got to evalu-ate ourselves ﬁ  rst of all, starting with me, and we’ll work from there.”
  Four weeks later, Muschamp called his play-
ers “soft.” Another rivalry game defeat, this time a 21-7 loss to Florida State in The Swamp, secured Florida’s ﬁ  rst season with six or more defeats since 1987.
  “We’re not a physically tough team, and 
we’re not a mentally tough team,’” Muschamp said after losing to the Seminoles. “That’s the facts — hard to say it. I’ve been called a lot of things in my life, but ‘soft’ is not one of them, and we are, and it’s my fault.”
  Two years removed from an undefeated reg-
ular season, the Gators were barely .500. They were broken, down and out.
  The same Florida that sparked the SEC’s 
streak of national championships was an after-thought in the NCAA’s toughest league.
  The fall from grace was complete. Mus-
champ began to rebuild.
     
  Muschamp was energetic and eager during 
his introductory press conference on December 14, 2010. He was clear, concise and direct.
  Still, his opening statement lasted more than 
20 minutes. 
  In his introduction to the UF community , 
Muschamp spelled out his coaching philosophy and his inﬂ  uences. Two things were clear: He was old-fashioned, and he was an SEC guy.
  He grew up a Florida fan, played for Georgia 
and coached at LSU and Auburn before accept-ing the Gators head coaching job. Muschamp knew the culture of the SEC.
  And after winning three national champion-
ships under offensive innovators Steve Spurrier and Urban Meyer, UF was changing course.
  “The SEC is the line-of-scrimmage league,” 
Muschamp said in December 2010. “We’ve got to be able to run the ball, we’ve got to run the ball to kill the game at the end, run the ball in the red zone, and run the ball to develop tough-ness on your football team.”
  Muschamp also preached stopping the run, winning the turnover battle and winning with blue-collar overachievers. Gone was Meyer’s “Top 1 percent of 1 percent” mentality.
  Muschamp’s philosophy underwent a bap-
tism by ﬁ  re with the Gators last season.
  Ranked opponents outrushed Florida by 
117.8 yards per game. The Gators averaged an SEC-low 61 rushing yards per game in those contests.
  UF’s minus-12 turnover margin was among 
the nation’s worst, ranking 113th nationally.
  Most glaring was Florida’s penchant for 
wearing down late in games. In SEC play last season, the Gators were outscored 72-22 in the fourth quarter.   UF was 0-5 when trailing at half-time.
  Florida didn’t overachieve in 2011. At 7-6, 
the Gators underachieved.
  “If you want to see (the) big picture in the 
last two years of the University of Florida, we’re 15-11. That’s unacceptable,” Muschamp said following the 2012 Gator Bowl. “Sometimes, I think you’ve got to put your realistic glasses on 
where you are as a program right at this point. 
It’s not where we’re going to be very long. I can assure you of that.”
     
  Dominique Easley goes to bed angry. Every 
night before falling asleep, he watches clips from Florida’s defeats last season. Losing makes him furious.
  “It’s like you’re going to watch a video clip 
of you getting punched in your face over and over again,” Easley said. “You’re going to get mad every time you watch it.”
  Pain, embarrassment and a sense of lost pride 
motivated the Gators during the offseason.
  More speciﬁ  cally , October 2011 motivated 
the Gators.
  “I told the guys all along, ‘Don’t ever forget 
the feeling you have right now,’” Muschamp said. “As a competitor, it ought to motivate you. If you’re truly a competitive guy , it ought to motivate you not to be in that situation again. I know I use it.”
  New strength coach Jeff Dillman helped 
Florida improve its strength and endurance by introducing Olympic-style weightlifting. His constant motivation helped the Gators improve their mental toughness.
  During summer workouts, Dillman coined 
the term, “Florida never breaks.”
  The team invokes “FNB” often. The players 
post #FNB on Twitter. Sharrif Floyd writes it on his athletic tape before games.
  “When times were the worst this offseason, 
and (the) beginning of the season when no one believed in us, we kept saying it,” Omar Hunter said. “Florida never breaks.”
      Muschamp has been impressed with his 
team’s response to the “soft” label. He has praised Dillman for Florida’s quick growth.
  For Florida never breaking.  “When you’re sitting there in the middle of 
June and the middle of July, you better be cre-ative in how to motivate some of these guys,” 
Muschamp said.  “I’ll be honest with you. I 
think back to when I was playing. It’s hard. It’s 150 degrees sitting outside, and you’re lifting weights. You better have somebody in there who has a great message to motivate you, and Jeff certainly does.”
  Jelani Jenkins believes he and his teammates 
have always wanted to succeed. The Gators simply needed adversity to grow.
  “We’ve always been a hungry team,” Jenkins 
said. “The main difference in the attitude now is we’ve been in those locker rooms and had those tears and had the pain. We felt all of that and all that builds up, and it’s a product of where we’re at today. We’re smarter. We have experience.”
       
Florida is winning with Muschamp’s phi-
losophy.
  One year removed from a 30-point blowout 
in Baton Rouge, La., UF outmuscled LSU on the line of scrimmage in a 14-6 win on Oct. 6.
  Mike Gillislee has led a surge in Florida’s 
ground game, which ranks third in the SEC with 212.7 yards per game. The Gators rank 12th na-tionally with 45.6 carries per game.
  Florida’s success in the ground game is 
largely due to offensive coordinator Brent Pease, who has been creative within his com-
mitment to Muschamp’s philosophy. Pease has 
incorporated several personal wrinkles into the Gators’ run-based attack, but most notably , he has employed multiple run packages with extra offensive linemen this season, especially against the Tigers.
  Said Pease after beating LSU: “You know 
what they say: ‘Mass kicks ass.’”
  Two weeks later, the Gators forced four fum-
bles and recovered three in a 44-11 win against the Gamecocks.
  Florida, which forced 14 turnovers all of last 
season, has tallied 15 through seven games.
  Defensive coordinator Dan Quinn coined the 
term “violators,” which describes players who are liable to fumble because they do not carry the ball correctly. 
  Offensively, the Gators have just four turn-
overs this season after averaging two per game in 2011. Quarterback Jeff Driskel has thrown only one interception in 2012.
  Quinn, who has coached the defense with Muschamp since Day 1 in Gainesville, admires Muschamp’s adherence to his personal philoso-phy, even after last season’s struggles.
  “One of the important things is when you 
have a belief in something, you stay the course and trust it, where sometimes, it can be easy to get off track” Quinn said. “That’s something Will never wavered from in terms of want-ing to run the ball, possess it, and take care of it on offense and try and get it on defense. Although we didn’t have the results that we wanted to in terms of that way last year, that was still the same message in the offseason — hadn’t changed. And that was his blueprint for winning and I think it kind of goes to show if you have a belief and stick with it, I think good things will follow.”
  Most remarkably, Florida, the second-ranked 
team in the BCS standings, is succeeding as a group of overachievers. The Gators were the No. 23 team in the nation before the season — picked to ﬁ  nish third in the SEC East.
  UF will face UGA, the team that capped the 
Gators’ worst stretch in more than 20 years last October. The same team that stopped 1 yard short of the end zone out of pity.
  The last time Florida played Georgia, Mus-
champ’s philosophy seemed like a failed theory forced upon a team that was not equipped to play that way.
  Now, a club that has assumed Muschamp’s 
identity and style will face arguably its toughest test on the road to redemption.
  Is Florida’s 7-0 start surprising?   “Nah,” Muschamp said.  He then took a second before expressing 
faith in his philosophy for the umpteenth time. The Muschamp Way has propelled the Gators back to national prominence.
  “(I) expect to win ‘em all — I did last year,” 
Muschamp said. “You ﬁ  nd ways to get it done. However you get it done, whether the odds are better for you or not, it really doesn’t matter to me. I have a positive outlook on everything we do in our organization, from recruiting to play-ing to practicing and the off-season, everything. I choose to believe that way.”

After ﬁ  nishing 2011 a disappointing 7-6, the Gators have plenty to celebrate in 2012. In Year 2 under coach Will Muschamp, Florida is 
7-0 and boasts the No. 2 BCS ranking thanks to a powerful rushing attack, increased toughness and an emphasis on turnovers.

Even as the Gators suffered through their ﬁ  rst four-game losing streak against SEC 
opponents since 1979, coach Will Muschamp never wavered from his process.

A UF student’s Instagram 
picture showing two Beta Theta 
Pi brothers dressed in blackface sparked controversy on and off campus Thursday.  
Blackface, a style of makeup 
used in 19th century theater pro-ductions to stereotype and carica-turize African-Americans, is seen as an offensive practice today.
The Gator chapter of the Na-
tional Association for the Advance-ment of Colored People posted the photo on its Facebook page Thurs-day afternoon with a message in-cluding “the fact that this is seen as acceptable is where the prob-lem lies.” It garnered more than 70 comments as of press time.
The UF student who originally 
posted the photo deleted it. 
Jonel Edwards, the president 
of the Gator NAACP chapter, said one of the executive board mem-bers posted it on the page. The 22-year-old political science junior said she also received an email with the photo that morning.

With 12 days until her hus-
band faces Barack Obama for 
the presidency, Ann Romney stopped for some Gainesville barbecue.
Romney made a stop at 
David’s Real Pit BBQ on 23rd Avenue on Thursday afternoon to meet with about 20 people while a crowd of about 100 supporters held signs and toddlers outside the restaurant.
The campaign stop — 
touted as a quick visit with Mitt Romney/Paul Ryan supporters — was one of several destinations for Romney in this swing state. She attended a rally in St. Augustine before booking it to Gainesville to get a take-out barbecue lunch.
Romney’s visit is among 
the most high-proﬁ  le Re-publican appearances in Gainesville this election cycle. And with Alachua County becoming a more Democratic county — 59.99 percent of Alachua County votes went to Barack Obama in 2008 — her appearance marks the Republican ﬁ  ght to regain the county.
“We’re seeing folks that 
voted for Obama in 2008 switching their votes and voting for Mitt Romney,” said Jill Bader, Florida com-
munica-tions direc-tor for the Republican N a t i o n a l Commit-
tee. “We’re seeing un-believable 
momentum across the states in all counties, including here in Gainesville.”
As Romney walked into 
the restaurant Thursday, the crowd inside erupted in ap-plause. She got food to-go, including some macaroni and cheese for the two waist-high Romney grandchildren accompanying her.
“She came up like any 
other person to look at the menu and order some food,” said Katy Melchiorre, chair- Ann Romney greets

MARK PATRICK KELLY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Bert Lucas hops into a pit of wa-
ter with a natural born killer every 
chance he gets.
For the past 20 years, Lucas, 40, of 
West Palm Beach, has performed at fairs and festivals around the world, entertaining and educating audi-ences by handling alligators.
Lucas will perform three shows 
a day at the 2012 Alachua County Fair, which ends Saturday.
His presentation, “Kachunga and 
the Alligator Show,” is produced for the company Wildlife Entertainment and Education. The show premiered in 1982 as a public awareness pro-gram to educate students through wildlife presentations, according to the Kachunga website.
“It’s an educational show, you 
know, we try to teach people about [alligators],” Lucas said.
Lucas saw a Kachunga show for 
the first time at the Florida State Fair in 1992 when he was a junior at the University of South Florida.
“I just thought it was so cool, and 
I started talking to the guys that ran the show, and I went to work for them next summer,” Lucas said.
Lucas left college to pursue his 
calling. He quickly became enam-ored of the showmanship and the chance to work with animals.
Twenty years later, Lucas said he 
loves to interact with the audience, especially when it’s someone’s first time seeing an alligator in real life.
“You can see the looks on their 
faces, and their eyes get big. They have so many questions,” Lucas said.
Aside from the performances, 
one of Lucas’ favorite parts of the job is the frequent traveling.
“I’ve been to the Philippines, I’ve 
been to Hawaii twice, I’ve been to Puerto Rico, all through Canada and everywhere in the other 49 [states],” Lucas said.
Lucas’ job isn’t all about being a 
rock star and rolling around with an alligator; it’s serious business.
A bite from an alligator will cause 
serious puncture wounds, bruising and infection, explained Lucas, who has been bitten several times.
“It hurts. It’s a lot of pressure; 
They have extremely powerful jaws, so there’s a lot of pressure involved. You don’t feel the teeth … all you feel is the pressure,” Lucas said.
Handling alligators up to 10 feet 
in length still makes Lucas nervous.
He has no plans to quit anytime 
soon, though.
“As far as me getting in the wa-
ter and being able to, you know, talk about them [alligators] and do a show — I can do that for another 20 years,” Lucas said.

◗ THE ROAD WAS CLOSED 
FOR ABOUT THREE HOURS.

Mike Fisher and Gabriel Pimen-
tel heard a rumbling outside their 
house.
Moments later, a loud thud shook 
their walls.
“We thought somebody was go-
ing to run through our house with a car,” said Fisher, a 22-year-old criminology senior. “That’s how low loud it was. That’s how close it sounded.”
At about 1:40 p.m. Thursday , a 
massive oak tree in front of Fisher’s house, located in the 2800 block of Northwest 27th Terrace, tipped over and landed on West University Av-enue, damaging two cars, injuring one person and shutting down the road for about three hours.
The tree’s branches took down 
several power lines, cutting off power for houses around the block, including Fisher’s.
A Gainesville Regional Utilities 
worker used a cherry picker to re-pair loose power lines and a dam-aged transformer.
Once power to the cables was 
shut off, a Gainesville Fire Rescue crew freed a 30-year-old woman trapped in her Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder under the tree.
An ambulance rushed her to 
Shands at UF with minor injuries, Gainesville Police spokesman Ben Tobias said.
The tree also fell on a Honda 
Civic, shattering the back window. The driver, David Kilgore, was not injured.
Kilgore, a 24-year-old UF alum-
nus, said he was driving several feet in front of the woman’s car before the tree fell.
“A half-second earlier, it would 
have been a problem,” he said. “This is a moment that made me really ap-preciate life.”
As GPD officers redirected east-bound and westbound traffic down toward Southwest Second Avenue, GRU crews worked to clear the tree from the road.
Crews also used saws to cut the 
fallen tree while Florida Department of Corrections work release inmates helped clear the road.
At 4:45 p.m., police reopened 
traffic lanes on West University Avenue, according to a GPD news release.

While Hurricane Sandy is brewing in the 
Atlantic, a different type of storm will be stew-
ing on EverBank Field between the Florida Gators and Georgia Bulldogs on Saturday . But Sandy will only brush by Jacksonville during the game.
“The main issue is going to be the winds,” 
said Andrew Shashy , a meteorologist at the Jacksonville National Weather Service.Winds from the Category 2 hurricane will 
be roughly a gusty 25 mph Saturday , Shashy said. There is a 50 percent chance of rain in the morning and early afternoon, which will di-minish by the time the game starts at 3:30 p.m. There is almost no chance of any weather that would stop the game, like thunder or light-ning, he said.
Temperatures will be in the 70s in the af-
ternoon, but Shashy recommends fans bring a sweater or jacket if they plan to go out Sat-urday evening. It will be breezy with lows in the 50s.
The storm is turning away from shore and 
going out to sea in the next few days, said Den-nis Feltgen, spokesman for the National Hur -
ricane Center. Shashy said Sandy is projected to be off the coast of New Jersey by Tuesday.
The game was windy last year, which af-
fected flag and baton twirling, Johana Balles-teros, a 19-year-old UF family, youth and com-munity sciences sophomore, said, adding that the chance of a flag or baton hitting someone is much greater with windy weather.
Still, she is optimistic about her perfor -
mance and pumped for the game.
“Florida-Georgia is incredibly exciting,” 
she said.

the Friends of the Library book sale?Today’s question: Are you excited for this weekend?
For those voting for the ﬁ  rst time in this presidential elec-
tion, it  may come as a surprise when you walk into the voting booth or retrieve your absentee ballot from the 
mailbox, the ballot is not simply two large boxes with Barack Obama and Mitt Romney’s names next to them.
In addition to the presidential race, Floridians are voting 
this year for U.S. and state senators and representatives, and a handful of ballot measures, as well. When you ﬁ  rst look at it, the long, seemingly complex questions are daunting. You realize you haven’t done any prior research. What’s a county commissioner or a homestead exemption?
It’s important to remember that it’s acceptable to leave 
any portion of the ballot blank if you wish. At the same time, though, you should ideally make an informed decision on every race and measure. This ensures you are taking full ad-vantage of the sacred right to vote, which forms the core of our ﬂ  awed but precious democracy.
Many don’t realize that races other than the presiden-
tial are often just as important, if not more so. Whereas the president sets the nation’s agenda and guides the general direction of the country, it is our legislators who will be writ-ing and passing the laws we live with every day . The most important set of laws in our state, the Florida Constitution, will be changed depending on the passage of any one of the dozen or so proposed (or legislatively-referred) constitution-al amendments on this year’s ballot.
Arguably , the most crucial votes you will be casting this 
year are for your federal and state representatives and sena-tors. One of the main reasons I chose to vote using an absen-tee ballot was so I could cast my vote for Alan Grayson, a ﬁ  ercely progressive former member of Congress who is run-ning again in the newly drawn Ninth District, which now includes my parents’ home in Davenport, after losing to his Tea Party opponent two years ago. 
If you’re registered to vote in Alachua County, then you 
will be voting for a representative from either District 3 or 5. Those voting in the Third District will have the opportu-nity to vote for either Republican incumbent Cliff Stearns, who led the overdramatic and overblown investigation into Solyndra, and Democratic challenger J. R. Gaillot Jr., a vir-tual unknown whose website in-dicates he supports strengthening the social safety net, supporting women’s rights and other typical Democratic positions.
In the latter race, veteran Dem-
ocratic incumbent Corrine Brown is running for re-election in the newly drawn Fifth District, which is even more gerrymandered than 
her current one, if that were possible. Her challenger, Le-Anne Kolb, is a lockstep Republican whose ﬁ  rst paragraph on her website’s “About” section reads: “LeAnne Kolb ac-cepted Jesus Christ as her savior 22 years ago. She is a dedi-cated Christian, and is going to Washington to ensure that Christian principles remain at the forefront of our countries laws.”
The most crucial ballot measures you’ll be voting on are 
proposed amendments one, ﬁ  ve, six and eight, each of which you should vote a resounding “NO!”
Amendment one would prevent the state from comply-
ing with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, un-dermining the access to insurance thousands more citizens will soon have under the law.
Amendment ﬁ  ve would increase legislators’ control over 
the state court system, allowing them to politicize the nomi-nation process through conﬁ  rmation hearings. 
Amendment six would restrict federal funds for abortion, 
further undermining women’s right to choose to make their own health care decisions with their doctors. 
Amendment eight would push our nation toward theoc-
racy, chipping away at the separation of church and state by repealing the ban on public funds for religious institutions.
Before you vote in this year’s election, be sure to inform 
yourself on all the issues and all the races and proposals you will ﬁ  nd on the ballot. The aforementioned races and mea-sures are vital to understand, but the ballot as a whole de-serves your most lucid understanding.

smell, that’s for sure, but we can’t quite exactly put our ﬁ  nger on it ... Oh, right, how silly of us! Fest is here. That’s why the air feels so foreboding and dirty.

Darts & Laurels
We want to start out by truly thanking anyone involved in 
helping solve the feral cat “paw”-blem on campus. There’s no need for our furry friends to be punished just because they don’t have a home. Hopefully ofﬁ  cials can continue to work toward a humane solution. We give a all-right-that’s-the-last-cat-pun-we’ll-make-for-meow-just-kitten LAUREL to Operation Cat-
nip.
It would be nice if we could give a “Laurel” to Ann Romney , 
who made a brief visit to Gainesville on Thursday afternoon, but hardly anyone was allowed to get near her at David’s Real Pit BBQ. If you’re going to say you’re making a visit, we’re not sure why you wouldn’t actually visit. Therefore we give a you-wore-a-nice-sweater-miss-please-don’t-let-your-husband-take-away-basic-human-rights DART to Ann Romney.
Remember how Donald Trump said his announcement, 
set to be released this past Wednesday , was going to be super awesome and life changing? It wasn’t. He challenged President Obama to release his college record and his passport — if he com-plied, Trump would donate $5 million to a charity of Obama’s choice. To challenge that, Stephen Colbert dared to donate $1 million to charity if Trump, well, would let Colbert place certain organs in Trump’s mouth. We give a one-of-you-is-still-classier-than-the-other-and-the-winner-is-Colbert LAUREL to Stephen 
Colbert. We don’t negotiate with terrorists, Mr. Trump.
BuzzFeed, a super fun site that teaches us what’s cool on the 
Internet, came out with a quiz this week that kind of lowers your self-esteem no matter if you do really well or really poorly: “How Well Do You Know Crappy Pizza?” We give a stop-trying-to-pizza-shame-us-but-also-this-quiz-was-fun FLART to Buzz-
Feed. Either way , you should still check them out for fun news. This is not a paid advertisement for BuzzFeed, calm down.
Apple announced a ton of new gadgets this week, including 
the new iPad Mini. We don’t know why they feel like they have to constantly come out with new things, but apparently its busi-ness model works. The company sold 26.9 million iPhones in the last ﬁ  scal quarter alone. We give a we-will-probably-still-buy-most-everything-you-tell-us-to-buy LAUREL to Apple. Just ac-
cept it and give in to consumerism, folks.
Britney Spears is in the news again, and it’s not for great 
reasons. Our favorite Queen of Pop Forever and Ever is on trial for libel and breach of contract of Sam Lufti, her former man-ager. More importantly, he let it slip during his testimony that a Broadway musical or motion picture depicting Courtney Love’s life with Kurt Cobain is probably in the works. We give a stop-hurting-everything-we-hold-dear DART to Sam Lufti.
Sometimes hotel employees can be weird or heartless or 
something, but not for one girl in Orlando. Maybe they knew her parents worked for a local TV news station, but they went the extra mile to return her lost Elmo doll. The staff at an Ame-lia Island hotel made an entire booklet of an adventure Elmo “went” on while he was lost. We give a now-our-hearts-feel-light-and-happy LAUREL to that hotel’s staff.
Have a very safe weekend everyone, and go Gators!

I am absolutely disgusted and disappoint-
ed by a picture I saw on my Facebook feed 
today.
In a picture originally posted on Instagram 
— now screen-captured for the world to see — two apparently white males are dressed in black tank tops, with sagging pants, do-rags, fitted caps and gold chains — all the makings of a rapper. The problem in the picture is these guys decided to color themselves brown.
They couldn’t just be white guys in hip-hop 
attire, huh? They just had to be black.
This is ridiculous. Are we really still employing blackface in 
this country as a means of entertainment? Is it 2012 or 1848?
Sure, I realize we, for the most part, don’t 
receive well-rounded high school educations. I know we learn nothing more than surface-level trivia about the contributions of African-American people in this country.
Is it your fault that the only black people 
you learned about in grade school were MLK and maybe George Washington Carver? No, it isn’t.
Hell, you probably only spent five mil-
liseconds learning about the contributions of people other than our Founding Fathers.
But for students at UF, an institution that 
prides itself on being a “public Ivy ,” to host what was apparently a BET vs. CMT party — something I see as ignorant in and of itself — and think it’s OK for people to color them-selves brown is absolutely ignorant.
Should there be consequences? Sure, but 
they should come in the form of social educa-tion.
We at UF cannot allow our fellow Gators 
— or fellow Americans for that matter — to remain completely ignorant to the history of offensive institutions like blackface.
This is only one aspect of the social igno-
rance that’s running rampant in this country, but if we’ve got to start here, fine.
There needs to be forums. There need to 
be seminars and classes to teach us why this is unacceptable. There should be some public outcry.
I’m not calling for anything extreme. I just 
want us to educate ourselves. If we do, maybe, just maybe, we can be a more united and pros-perous society.
Billy Kennedy
UF journalism senior 
I am a second-year student in the UF Col-
lege of V eterinary Medicine. In our ethics class last year, we had a debate on Operation Cat-nip and feral cats that included a presentation from Dr. Levy, and also from a wildlife veteri-narian at the college.
In short, a person has to side with cats or 
with wildlife — not both. It is true that feral cats are incompatible with wildlife, and Oper -
ation Catnip makes the lives of the kitties bet-ter but doesn’t make the lives of the wildlife better. In the Alligator article on this issue, Dr. Levy is quoted, “The results of our study in-dicated that long-term reduction of free-roam-ing cat numbers is feasible by [Trap-Neuter-Release],” Levy wrote in an article published in 2003. “It has been reported that feral cats become less aggressive toward each other and more friendly toward their feeders following neutering, and this may have encouraged adoption of previously feral cats.”
First off, sure, less aggression may mean 
more adoptions. Sounds great. But what about all the cats that bide their time at the shel-ter and are euthanized because there aren’t enough homes? So, why is making a feral cat more adoptable beneficial? 
There’s a limited amount of space, so it’s 
unlikely a large proportion would be adopted, regardless of how friendly they become.
While her quote, overall, sounds very hu-
mane and great for cats, if cats are less aggres-sive to each other, then their survival rates increase. Kitten survival rates also increase be-cause neutered tomcats are no longer territo-rial and no longer kill kittens. But the popula-tion is sterilized, right? So, what kittens? TNR is only truly functional at controlling a popula-tion when that population is isolated from any immigration into the colony.
Studies have been conducted that prove 
that when immigration occurs, the feral cat population actually increases in the face of TNR programs — all due to the other factors at play (such as the decreased aggression to each other).
One other point of controversy is the le-
gality of Operation Catnip. Florida law states that it is illegal to release any nonnative spe-cies into the wild without a permit. Cats are considered nonnative. It has been known for quite some time that Operation Catnip is tech-nically illegal. When it was first founded, a lawyer attempted to sue the program for this. The lawsuit was dropped due to the uproar and support of TNR from cat lovers, and also for political reasons (for one, Bernie Machen’s wife decided to be a large proponent of the program).
Of course, there’s always the flip side of the 
coin that argues for the cat’s welfare. Of course, it seems more barbaric to kill them than to neuter, vaccinate and release. Of course, kitties will be happier to return to their colonies and live out their days. But again, this is an issue that demands a choice for cats or for wildlife — not both. UF is a designated wildlife sanc-tuary , so I understand that their priority is to save and protect the wildlife on campus, not the feral cats. It doesn’t make them horrible people — just people with different priorities on an issue that doesn’t leave much wiggle room for compromise.

“Why would you have a 
party like that?” she said. “It’s not OK.”
The party theme was “rock 
stars and rappers,” and it was held at a venue downtown, said Beta Theta Pi president Ethan McMahon.
He said the two brothers in 
the photo were the only ones made up in blackface.
“As an organization, we 
pride ourselves on the consid-erable diversity of our mem-bership and are disappointed in the poor judgement and actions of two of our mem-bers,” the 21-year-old political science and economics senior wrote in an emailed statement. “While their actions were not intended with any malice or ill will to any members of our community, clearly they were offensive, and we accept full responsibility accordingly.”
He also said the chapter 
issues an apology to the UF community and will work with administration and fra-ternity leadership to ensure this doesn’t happen again.
McMahon said judicial ac-
tion will probably be taken.
Vice President for Student 
Affairs Dave Kratzer sent an email to students involved in sororities and fraternities Thursday in response to the incident.
“We work very hard to 
create a welcoming environ-ment for all students,” Kratzer wrote. “The actions of these students are a poor reflection on the University of Florida.”
Thursday night, the Insti-
tute of Black Culture held an emergency cypher for people to discuss their feelings.
Edwards said it’s impor-
tant the fraternity brothers are held accountable for their ac-tions.
She wants to have a conver-
sation with them concerning the history behind blackface.
“From my point of view, 
they don’t see anything wrong with it,” she said.

Shaking hands and asking 
names, Romney walked to each of the restaurant’s red booths. Supporters smiled giddily.
“She made sure to go to every 
single person in the place,” said Melchiorre, a 21-year-old politi-cal science and telecommunica-tion senior.“It’s nice that she can acknowl-
edge the hard work that goes on in 
this town.”
By about 3:30 p.m., Romney 
made her way back to the cam-paign bus, detouring to walk up to a growing crowd that had been kept away from the restaurant by officers.
A woman shouted “Welcome 
to Gainesville, new first lady 
of the United States,” as Rom-ney gripped hands and hugged shoulders.
Supporters held Romney signs 
and waved as her bus pulled 
away from the parking lot. There was talk of whether she tried the sweet tea.
“I think it’s awesome that 
she decided to come through 
Gainesville,” said Breonna Bris-tow, 19-year-old nursing sopho-more at Santa Fe College. “I hope I get to see her.”
For Bristow, the Democratic 
majority isn’t dissuading. And Romney’s visit only reinforces that idea.
“Just because Gainesville’s 
more liberal, there’s also still a lot of Republicans out here,” she said. “So it’s showing us she hasn’t forgotten about us.”

Black, white and green balloons and the 
smell of savory , slow-cooked concoctions 
greeted patrons at the grand opening of Yume Umēe: Japanese Kitchen Thursday.
Yume Umēe, which means “yummy 
dreams” in Japanese, recently replaced Gainesville restaurant staple Rolls n Bowls, located at 3117 SW 34th St.
Owned by the same management — who 
also owns the upscale restaurant Dragonfly Sushi & Sake downtown — the rebranded res-taurant offers “slow food fast,” said Josh Hoff-man, the 26-year-old general manager.
“This is the kind of food a Japanese family 
would eat in their home,” Hoffman said.
Bowls and sandwiches cost  $7 to $9, de-
pending on which meat customers choose.
Yume Ume does not serve sushi rolls, Hoff-
man said, but instead offers an array of tradi-tionally cooked menu items.
Chalkboard menus line the back wall, list-
ing handwritten dishes like baked chicken, miso-cured tofu and lemongrass tempeh.
Corporate chef Hiroo Nagahara, 29, said 
he used his mother’s recipe for the base of the braised beef. The base of the pulled pork dish was his grandmother’s.
“This is hearty, warm home cooking,” he 
said. “We wanted to instill a feeling of nostal-gia in our guests.”
Worn wood paneled the walls, and silver 
chairs and steel embellishments filled the res-taurant.  Clear, glass bottles clinked as patrons filled them with sauces to take home.
Customers waited in line as employees 
pieced together meals assembly-line style.
First, proteins, which simmered for about 
three hours, were plucked from colorful Crock-Pots. Patrons then pointed to sides and sauces they wanted to add to their dishes, finishing at the register to ring up their items.
The room had a relaxed feel, with warm 
red tones, cool leather lounge chairs and an ambient, hanging light fixture in the center of the ceiling.
“At the end of the day, food is first,” he 
said. “It’s nourishment. Nourishment for the body, the mind, the soul.”
Manny Rodriguez said he liked the new 
changes.
“I’m not sad the old place is gone, because 
I’m happy the new place is here,” said the 31-year-old UF alumnus.  “It’s fresh.” New restaurant rebrands itself, serves homestyle Japanese food

As about 300 bands gear up for 
Fest 11, about 8,000 people will 
flood into the city with empty stom-achs and full wallets for a weekend of music.
The Fest, which starts today and 
ends Sunday , is an annual music festival that hosts performances in venues, bars and restaurants in and near downtown. The festival at-tracts attendees from as far as Great Britain and Japan.
Many Gainesville businesses 
welcome the Fest as a lucrative gift before the slow winter season and are preparing to make the most of it.
“We’re stocking up on every-
thing: food, alcohol and beverages,” said Matt VanDusen, Holiday Inn University Center front desk and guest services employee.
The hotel is the official headquar -
ters hotel for Fest. All 164 rooms are sold out to Fest attendees, said Van-Dusen.
Tate Clair, owner of The Lunch-
box, said he expects the small res-taurant’s revenue to be four times higher than usual this weekend.
Clair has his restaurant stocked 
up on sauces, quadrupling the reci-pes for this weekend. He also hired a few extra people for the weekend and booked his staff’s schedule solid.
“We try to make money and 
have a good time,” he said.
Clair has also picked up chicken stock and vitamin C supplement “Emergen-C” so his staff doesn’t get sick from the draining weekend.
“We’ll all be dead by the end of 
the weekend,” Clair said.
Adam Wood, manager of Durty 
Nelly’s Irish Pub, said his bar is ex-pected to pack in about 3,000 cus-tomers over the weekend. He said he’s ordered about 200 cases of beer to serve.
“It’s definitely better on Florida-
Georgia weekend,” Wood said.
Wood said he hired two extra se-
curity workers for the festival. Over three days, each employee will have to work at least 19 hours. He said he will have to work 35 hours himself.
“It’s long hours and busy time, 
but in the end, it’s worth it for the business and the employees,” Wood said.
A popular souvenir of the Fest 
experience is a “Stressface” tattoo from Anthem Tattoo Parlor.
What started off as two simple 
designs of Dracula and Franken-stein boomed into about 30 new de-signs set for this year. The parlor’s owner, Mike Salay , said the tattoo gained popularity after Andrew Seward from Against Me! posted the design on Twitter last year.
Anthem Tattoo Parlor takes 
no reservations on Fest weekend. There will be a waiting list nearly 70 names long for one of the famous keepsakes. Over the weekend, Sa-lay expects his parlor will ink 150 tattoos.
“We didn’t expect it to blow up 
like it did,” Salay said.Local businesses prep for today’s flood of Fest attendees

Grab a picnic blanket and get 
ready to groove — UF Homecom-
ing’s Swamp Symphony is sched-uled from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Sunday on Flavet Field.
Students and Gainesville com-
munity members can attend the free outdoor concert.
“It’s a sampler, really, of the 
offerings within the College of Fine Arts,” said Andy How-ard, spokesman for the college. “A student would spend many evenings trying to see all these groups one night apiece.”
The show will include perfor-
mances by UF’s Symphony Or-chestra, Men’s Glee Club and Jazz Band, along with the University Gospel Choir and Agbedidi Afri-can Drum and Dance Ensemble.
The College of Fine Arts and 
UF Homecoming will be collabo-rating for the second year to pres-ent the event.
About 700 people came to last 
year’s Swamp Symphony, but organizers said they hope the crowd will be larger on Sunday, director Michael Levey, 19, said.
“The performance last year 
was great,” the telecommunica-tion sophomore said, “but there are going to be a lot of new sur-prises to look out for.”
This year, education cel-
ebration awards, including the Homecoming Outstanding Fac-ulty Award and the Homecom-ing Outstanding Mentor of Un-dergraduate Research Award, will be presented at the concert.
In accordance with this year’s 
Homecoming theme, “United We Growl,” the concert will honor the 
armed forces with patriotic songs. Perform-ers will also 
play renditions of traditional UF songs like “The Orange and Blue” and 
“We Are The Boys.”
“Our goal is to give everyone 
the chance to celebrate home-coming in their own way,” said UF Homecoming general chair Hannah Swerdloff, a 21-year-old public relations senior.
Howard said he wanted stu-
dents to be touched by the arts at UF by creating a new tradition, which he hopes will someday be-come as common as painting the 34th Street wall.
“Fine arts on this campus have 
a rich tradition over 100 years old,” he said. “Swamp Symphony is our occasion to celebrate that.”UF’s Homecoming

While some students lounged on the Plaza 
of the Americas, others sat confined in crates.
Peta2 held a Glass Wall Slaughterhouse 
Exhibit on Wednesday and Thursday. Stu-
dents were able to sit in sow gestation crates in a burgundy, 20-foot-by-30-foot inflatable tent and watch a video narrated by Paul Mc-Cartney about the conditions animals have to cope with in the meat industry.
Peta2, the youth division of People for 
the Ethical Treatment of Animals, decided to bring The Glass Wall exhibit to college campuses because students tend to be open-minded, said Lisa Hines, the exhibit coordi-nator.Peta2 came to UF because of its strong ties 
with UF’s Student Animal Alliance.
“Most people aren’t aware of what hap-
pens in a slaughterhouse and what animals go through,” she said.
Hines said most students were receptive 
and wanted to know how they could help.
Alain Delapaz, a 26-year-old business 
management junior, said he’s against animal abuse, such as chicken fights and killing ani-mals for fur. But he doesn’t see the harm in killing animals for food.
“We must improve animals’ quality of life 
while they’re living but still harvest them like we’ve been doing for centuries,” he said.
Delapaz said vegetarian and vegan foods 
taste good, but he couldn’t survive off it be-cause he said he needs protein.
“God gave us these [teeth] to eat through 
meat,” he said. Students get slaughterhouse experience through exhibitJEWEL MIDELIS

From college students furnish-
ing apartments to collectors look-
ing to find a hidden gem, Gaines-ville’s first Great Garage Sale is expected to draw a crowd this weekend.
The city’s first collaborative ga-
rage sale will be from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturday at the southeast field at the Gainesville Regional Airport, 3880 NE 39th Ave.  
About 80 vendors will sell 
items that range from household items to crafts to art, said Laura Aguiar, the public relations and governmental affairs manager for the airport.
“We expect a lot of household 
items for bargains,” she said. “It would be great for students look-ing for something to furnish their apartment.”
For Douglas Meyers, who has 
been finding hidden treasures for about 40 years, Saturday’s event is a big opportunity, he said.
“I started buying at auctions 
when I was about 9,” he said, “when I had special permission from the auctioneer.”
Aguiar said the event is the air -
port’s new way of supporting the March of Dimes. The amount of vendors has allowed the airport to surpass last year’s charity dona-tions. The event will have 30 more vendors than originally expected.
“I think we’re getting even 
more excited because we have had such an incredible response,” she said.Citywide garage sale kicks offHoward
“We expect a lot of 
household items for bar -
gains.”

Florida entered Thursday night’s 
matchup with South Carolina in control 
of its finish in the Southeastern Confer -
ence. But, for the first two-thirds of the game, the Gators passed on their oppor -
tunity to seize control.
Several times in the first half, UF at-
tackers opted to pass the ball rather than take shots that could have given Florida the lead.
Adriana Leon changed that in the 
65th minute.
The junior forward received a pass 
from midfielder Erika Tymrak and fired a shot past Gamecocks goalkeeper Sa-brina D’Angelo. With a little help from the foot of a 
South Carolina defender, the ball found its way into the back of the net for the Gators’ first goal.
“That was huge,” midfielder Annie 
Speese said. “Because we just kept push-ing and pushing for a goal, and when it finally happened, it let us relax even more.” 
Leon’s score proved to be the game-
winner in Florida’s (14-4-1, 11-2 SEC) 3-0 victory against South Carolina (6-9-4, 3-7-3 SEC) on Thursday in Columbia, S.C. 
With the win, the Gators clinched 
their second SEC championship in three years. 
“It’s an incredible feeling,” said Tym-
rak, who was a key player on the 2010 SEC championship team. 
“Our team is incredible. … This is 
definitely going to be one of my favorite memories.”
After Leon put Florida on the board, 
Speese added insurance. 
In the 74th minute, junior Taylor Tra-
vis sent a corner kick toward the goal, where it was headed by a South Carolina defender and bobbled by the keeper. Speese took advantage of the miscue and scored the Gators’ second goal.
“I just kind of got lucky with the re-
bound,” Speese said. “It came right to me, and I just volleyed it in.”
Speese was not done scoring. With three minutes left in the game, GREG LUCA

Although Omar Hunter’s hometown of 
Buford, Ga., is only about 45 miles west of 
Athens, Florida’s matchup against Georgia doesn’t have any special meaning. 
Georgia was never his childhood favor -
ite — that was FSU. And Hunter doesn’t consider the clash with Georgia his favorite game — that honor goes to UF’s matchup with LSU.
Hunter tracked down tickets for friends 
and family members to watch No. 3 Flori-da face No. 12 Georgia on Saturday at 3:30 p.m. in Jacksonville, but he isn’t treating the game any differently. 
“It’s going to be fun, but I treat it like any 
other game,” Hunter said. “Going out and preparing like I always have, and hopefully we can get the win.”
That level-headedness is a key reason 
why Hunter, a redshirt senior, is one of the leaders on Florida’s defensive line. 
UF’s coaches have emphasized that the 
matchup with Georgia is no more impor -
tant than any other, and Hunter has embod-ied that focus. 
“I haven’t seen [anything] different from 
him,” defensive coordinator Dan Quinn said. 
“Omar, to his credit, has done a really 
good job of preparing week in and week out — on film, doing the things necessary to do. I’ve always been impressed [by] the way he’s prepared.”
Defensive end Dominique Easley said 
playing alongside a veteran like Hunter has been helpful. 
With appearances in 50 games, Hunter 
understands football better than any of Florida’s other defensive linemen. 
He also understands how to avoid be-
coming too pumped up for any one game — a lesson that is proving useful this week.  
“It gives him respect on the team,” Quinn said. “(He’s) someone they all look to because of the fact he has a real even dis-position.”
Hunter’s teammates can also look up to 
him for his play in 2012. With 25 tackles, Hunter trails only Sharrif Floyd — who has 26 — for the lead among Florida defensive linemen. 
Three of Hunter’s tackles have been for 
a loss. This season has been downright 
scary for the rest of the alliga-torSports crew when Adam 
Pincus is at the wheel. Whether it’s agitating 18-wheeler drivers on our way to College Station, Texas, or al-most driving off a hill in Knoxville, Tenn., something always seems to happen on Southeastern Confer -
ence road trips. With Halloween six days away, the gang is getting ready for another road trip — this time to Jacksonville for the World’s Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party. This de facto SEC East championship game will surely spur several intense Will Mus-champ facial expressions. Those, my friends, are the scariest things of all.
 Now, onto the picks! Oklahoma (-10) will toss Notre 
Dame around like Dominique Eas-ley’s Chucky doll because…
 Bob Stoops is the man. The Soon-
ers will control the football with their running game. They’re tied for seventh nationally with 20 rushing touchdowns this season. Notre Dame hasn’t allowed any. But the Irish haven’t faced a back like Blake “The Belldozer” Bell, whose eight rush-ing touchdowns are the fifth high-est among quarterbacks. The divine run for the Golden Domers ends in wagon country. Plus, the leprechaun mascot is downright creepy. Hallow-een costume idea?
—ADAM PINCUS
Notre Dame (+10) will give Bob 
Stoops the spooks because...
Everyone should be Manti Te’o

do not show up in the box score. The big-
gest lineman in Florida’s regular rotation at 313 pounds, Hunter is the anchor of the 
nation’s No. 10 rush de-fense. Florida allows just 97.3 yards per game. 
“He needed to do a bet-
ter job of disengaging on blocks and has held the point extremely well for us this year,” coach Will Muschamp said. “(He) is 
having an outstanding senior season.”
Hunter has already topped the 17 tack-
les he posted in 2009 and the 23 tackles he notched in 2010. 
He set a career-high with 31 in 13 games 
last year and is on pace to shatter that mark this season. 
Hunter said he feels more explosive 
than he has at any point in his career, an improvement he attributes to new strength and conditioning coach Jeff Dillman. 
Muschamp said Hunter needed to be 
stronger at the point of attack. Hunter has answered the call, leading to the best sea-son of his career. 
“He’s really playing his best football in 
our two years here, and really since he’s been here,” Muschamp said. “He accepted the challenges in front of him, and he cer -
tainly has capitalized.”

football? Irish all the way! Touchdown Jesus! 
—GREG LUCA
Leading the way at 41-23 is Rivals’ Bryan “Chubby cha-
sin’ ain’t easy” Holt, who has had to intensify his hunting methods as the prey begins to catch on to his tricks. If Holt doesn’t adapt, he’ll go from pursuing contestants from “The Biggest Loser” to just earning the moniker himself.
In second at 38-26 is the Miami Herald’s Matt “She’s not 
my girlfriend“ Watts, who has had the same visitor every Tuesday night for months but swears it’s nothing serious. Just admit it, Watts: You’re in love. The girls at midtown are already tired of hearing stories about your girl in Du-val. 
Ranking third with a 37-27 record is the Associated 
Press’ Mark “Hey Dad, wanna have a catch?” Long, who fulfilled a life-long dream on Tuesday when he got to throw a football with offensive coordinator Brent Pease at his weekly media availability. And just like Ray Kinsella’s dad in “Field of Dreams,” Mark threw like a girl. Really, man? Can’t muster a spiral from 10 feet away? Remember, fingers on the laces. 
In fourth with a 35-29 mark is alligatorSports editor Greg 
“Check out my MySpace page” Luca, who was stumped when he attempted to “like” a friend’s Facebook photo with rapper Kendrick Lamar because he couldn’t identify the proper button. Hint: It’s the one that looks like Jelani Jenkins’ thumb cast. 
Sitting in fifth at 32-32 is Joe “I can’t do movie reviews” 
Morgan, who doesn’t seem to understand the concept of a five-second movie review on alligatorSports podcasts. He only uses 2.7 of the five seconds, but perhaps that’s still 2.7 seconds too long. So you’re saying “Moneyball” was good? How insightful. 
Tied with Joe at 32-32 is Adam “I’m pretty sure I have 
her number“ Pincus, who has dragged digits out of so many uninterested females desperate to get rid of him that he honestly believed he’d met a fictitious baton twirler a colleague invented this week. Well, I guess you’ve got just as good a chance with her as you do with all of the real ones.  
Rounding out the three-way tie at 32-32 is Jason “PROF_SS_ONAL_SM“ Lieser, who thought a game of hangman on the locker room whiteboard was a good way to pass the time between interviews. I’m sure Muschamp would be happy to see his catchphrase “You guys ain’t got no guts, man” being put to good use. 
And in dead-ass last place with a piss poor record of 
30-34 is alligatorSports writer Josh “The Eagles suck, too!” Jurnovoy, who was recently barred from joining a group of friends bemoaning the plight of their respective NFL teams. Sorry, Josh, but even misery doesn’t love company enough to have you around.Hunter , from page 14UF top seed in SEC Tourney
she put the finishing touch on the vic-
tory. 
Sophomore outside back Tessa 
Andujar dribbled up the goal line and 
delivered a pass to Speese directly in front of the net.
Speese beat the 
keeper for the second time in 14 min-utes, extending Florida’s lead to 3-0. 
“[Andujar] found me with a per -
fect ball, and I just kind of redirected it,” Speese said. “It’s one that we’ve been talking about all season, and it’s nice to finally execute.”
Florida secured the No. 1 seed in 
the SEC Tournament with the win. 
Tournament play begins on 
Wednesday.  The 2012 SEC title is Florida’s 12th 
conference crown, all of which have come under coach Becky Burleigh. 
“I do not take any single one of 
these for granted,” Burleigh said. “Last year, when we didn’t win it, it was such a disappointment, and so to get back on top again — it’s huge. Ev-ery single one of them feels great.”
Although Burleigh said winning 
the SEC title was one of Florida’s pri-mary goals this season, she added that the team has more on its mind than just a conference championship.
“As exciting as it was, our team 
was really calm when we won,” Bur -
leigh said.

Erving Walker is playing overseas in 
Italy, but his name is still prominent in Flor-
ida’s record books. 
He graduated after last season as UF’s all-
time assists leader with 547. He ranks fourth in career scoring with 1,777 points. 
Records weren’t the only thing Walker 
left at UF. When he started his professional career, he also left behind a starting spot at point guard.
After two years as a backup, junior Scot-
tie Wilbekin will get an opportunity to start in 2012-13.
“Right now I feel good about him,” 
coach Billy Donovan said. “Scottie has re-ally shown a lot of improvement. He’s got-ten better. I’ve got a lot of confidence in him because of the things that he can do.”
In Wilbekin’s 74 games as a Gator, he has 
started twice. Both starts were alongside Walker. Wilbekin averaged only 16.1 minutes per 
game during his first two years at Florida. 
Donovan has made it clear that he wants 
Wilbekin to be his own player and not mim-ic Walker’s style. Still, Donovan would like to see Wilbekin improve as an offensive threat. 
“I want [Wilbekin] to be aggressive on 
offense,” Donovan said. “Erving, because of his size, what enabled him to play at this lev-el was his ability to shoot the ball from deep, and that was always a weapon. I don’t think we need or want Scottie doing that, but we do need Scottie to be a threat offensively.”
Wilbekin attempted only 76 shots last 
season, as Walker and Brad Beal were Flor-ida’s primary options on offense. But, after working on his shot in practice, Wilbekin has seen improvement.  
“It’s coming pretty natural,” Wilbekin 
said. “I’ve got a lot of confidence in my shot right now.” 
Wilbekin envisions himself playing 
mostly  point guard, but he expects to share time with senior Kenny Boynton. Wilbekin is confident in his ability to switch between the two guard positions. 
“I’m completely comfortable with [play-
ing shooting guard],” Wilbekin said. “I did some of that last year. I played some of the three and some of the four last year. I know all of the plays from every position, so it’s not really going to be that difficult.”

Junior quarterback Aaron Murray attempts a pass during Georgia’s 29-
24 victory against Kentucky on Saturday in Lexington, Ky.
AAron MurrA y
JOSH JURNOVOY
Alligator Staff Writer
 
Mark Richt didn’t hesitate to 
categorize Aaron Murray as one 
of the best quarterbacks he has coached.
Richt mentored Heisman win-
ners Charlie Ward and Chris Weinke during his time as Florida State’s offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach in the 1990s. At Georgia, he coached No. 1 overall NFL Draft pick Matthew Stafford for three years.
In one aspect of the game, he 
put his current starter above the rest.
“I just don’t think I’ve had a 
guy that prepares like Murray prepares,” Richt said. “There re-ally hasn’t been one, and there’s been some really good ones. I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feel-ings. But this guy, he’s really taken it to another level when it comes to prep.”
That work ethic helped the 
junior signal caller win the start-ing job prior to his first season at Georgia.
As a freshman, Murray en-
tered the Southeastern Confer -
ence spotlight and did not seem out of place. He completed more than 60 percent of his passes for 3,049 yards. He also threw 24 touchdowns and eight intercep-tions.
“We put a lot on our quar -
terbacks, and it takes a great commitment to really be good,” Richt said. “If you’re not willing to work, you might as well play another position or go to another school.”
This season, Murray’s comple-
tion percentage is up to 65.3 per -
cent, and he has a touchdown-to-interception ratio of 4-to-1.
Murray will look to continue 
his solid play at quarterback to-morrow when the No. 12  Bull-dogs (6-1, 4-1 SEC) try to upset the No. 3 Gators (7-0, 6-0 SEC) and keep their SEC East title hopes alive. 
Richt said Murray enjoys the 
process of preparing for games. 
“He loves the grind of learning 
how to be an SEC quarterback, learning how to be a potential professional quarterback,” Richt said. “He eats it up. He works like no one’s business.”
Murray’s 168.63 passer rating 
ranks seventh in the country and second in the SEC. But Florida defensive coordinator Dan Quinn said Murray can also be effective with his legs.“He is a hard guy to sack be-
cause he clearly knows when he feels pressure,” Quinn said. “I’ve got a lot of respect for him and how he plays at that position in terms of being able to distribute the ball to guys.”
Murray’s statistics against the 
Gators have been average, but he was good enough during critical moments of the Bulldogs’ 24-20 win last season. He completed 15 of his 34 passes for 169 yards but threw two fourth-down touch-down passes to bring Georgia back from a 17-3 deficit.
One of those touchdowns 
came with junior cornerback Jay-len Watkins in coverage. Watkins has used memories of the 2011 game as motivation. He added that the Florida defensive backs cannot rely on Murray to make  mistakes on Saturday.
“He’s very quick with his deci-
sion making,” Watkins said. “You can tell he understands coverag-es. He can pick you apart, to the field, to the boundary, it doesn’t really matter. He can do every-thing. This week, we can’t say this quarterback can’t make this throw, can’t make that throw. He can make everything.”
