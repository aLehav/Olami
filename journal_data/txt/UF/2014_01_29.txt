STAFF REPORT
In his State of the Union address Tues-
day night, President Barack Obama outlined 
plans to enable startup companies to grow 
and extend more opportunities to hardwork-
ing college students.
The state of the union is strong, he said.One of the major contributors to this 
strength, he said, is that Congress agreed on a new budget that leaves more room for funding priorities like education.“The budget compromise should leave us 
freer to focus on creating new jobs, not creat-
ing new crises,” Obama said.
He cited a White House-organized College 
Opportunity Summit that garnered commit-
ments from 150 universities, businesses and 
nonproﬁ  ts to “reduce inequality in access to 
higher education — and help every hard-working kid go to college and succeed when they get to campus.”
As an example, Obama said his adminis-VOLUME 108 ISSUE 88 WWW.ALLIGATOR.ORG WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 29, 2014

Although UF Online is only four weeks 
into its ﬁ  rst semester, on-campus students are 
beginning to take notice of the program’s ef-fects on their courses.
Elizabeth Phillips, the executive director of 
UF Online, wrote in an email that the program has 596 students. UF Online is the new, fully online four-year baccalaureate program.
“Enrollment in UF Online was very strong 
for its ﬁ  rst semester,” Phillips said. “Applica-tions are also strong for Summer and Fall.”
She is working on what degrees will be 
added to the program for Fall, but she said some majors like psychology are certain addi-tions.
The program is going as planned, but some 
feel it has blurred the lines between on- and off-campus students in UF’s Warrington Col-lege of Business Administration.
Students like Sean Treiser, a 19-year-old 
UF economics sophomore, are upset that their courses have transitioned to totally online platforms even though they’re traditional stu-dents.
Treiser said two of his courses are com-
pletely online with the exception of live tests, but there are many courses that don’t have live testing, either.
“Students on campus taking the course 
might as well be in Africa,” he said.
Horace Tucker, associate director of the 
Heavener School of Business, said it’s likely a misunderstanding that’s causing the unrest.Tucker said the business college operated 
with online classes long before UF Online be-gan — but there are two key differences.
One, he said, is that the Florida bill creat-
ing UF Online states courses shared between the program and on-campus students can no longer have “live sections.” The college has redubbed them “live lectures” and made the time and location available to students. Space is limited, but it was for live sections, too.
“If they construct their schedules carefully, 
they can still go to class,” Tucker said.
The other change is that professors’ aca-
demic freedoms now extend to how much content they want to put online. Before, pro- Traditional students feeling effects of UF Online

While the Seminoles are 
enjoying a rare snow day and 
canceled classes, Gators will be slogging through possible freez-ing rain and sleet. 
As temperatures dip to near 
and below freezing, the addi-tion of rain to the mix makes some question if students will soon be building snowmen in the swamp, but WRUF chief meteorologist Jeff Huffman said there is no possibility of snow in Gainesville.“There never has been a 
chance with this storm system in Gainesville,” he said. 
However, from midnight to 
6 a.m. on Thursday, there will be a chance of sleet and freezing rain.
Sleet is frozen rain falling to 
the ground as ice pellets, and freezing rain is precipitation that freezes upon contact with the ground, leaving a glaze of ice.
Today’s temperatures will be 
in the 30s with a windchill drop-ping below freezing, Huffman said. 
Although local media out-
lets reported ﬂ  urries near Gainesville in 2010, the last re-corded snowfall in Gainesville was in 1989, according to wun-derground.com.
Stanley Yoder, a 19-year-old 
UF nursing sophomore, said he’s going to turn on the heat and break out the blankets in prepa-ration for the cold weather.
“I’m deﬁ  nitely gonna be bun-
dling up,” Yoder said.No snow for Gainesville despite coldSEE ONLINE, PAGE 4

Speakers at Student Senate on 
Tuesday raised questions about 
the procedure by which justices 
are appointed to UF’s Supreme 
Court.
In addition to the Senate’s votes 
to pass a resolution, two funding bills and a Senator Accountabil-
ity Act, it also unanimously ap-
pointed Brianne Lewis as its new Supreme Court justice.
Public debate opened when 
multiple senators yielded their speaking time to two UF law stu-dents, who received ﬁ  ve minutes to discuss their opinions on the justice appointment process. The UF Supreme Court’s main func-
tion is to ensure the checks and 
balances are in place for executive and legislative branches, accord-ing to the Student Government 
website. 
Alex Paez and Aubrey Burris, 
UF Levin College of Law students 
who said they were interested in being appointed for Supreme Court justice, addressed the Sen-
ate about their experiences with 
the appointment process.
Burris said that even though 
the judicial branch is comprised 
entirely of law students, she is cer-
tain most of them aren’t aware of the branch.
“I am conﬁ  dent in stating that 
the overwhelming majority of law 
students don’t even know that 
this exists, let alone its importance or how it functions,” she said.
Burris said in her speech that 
despite her efforts to learn about how the appointment process works, she did not receive any re-sponses that were beneﬁ  cial and was never informed of the pro-
cess.
“The judicial branch remains 
an enigma of appointment with 
no set process of application and 
not even a hint as to when that 
process would occur for law stu-dents to be on the board,” she said. “Transparency in this process … would only serve to provide you 
with the most qualiﬁ  ed and inter-
ested students.”
Minority leader Sen. Michael 
Christ said the two students were 
interested in applying for appoint-
ment, but their efforts to commu-nicate with Student Body Presi-dent Christina Bonarrigo, who handles those appointments, went 
unanswered.
“They wanted to come and 
speak and voice their concerns 
with how the process is conduct-ed,” he said. “They felt, and I feel 
as well, that in order to get the 
best-qualiﬁ  ed-possible applicants, it should be made well known to the entire law school.”
Reached later for comment, 
Bonarrigo said, “We appreciate the two students’ feedback and will look into our procedures.”
According to the SG website, 
each justice is appointed by the president and then conﬁ  rmed by the Senate. These justices remain in ofﬁ  ce until they graduate. 
Lewis, who was appointed a 
Supreme Court justice, has served as vice president of membership for Florida Blue Key and director of creative for Gator Growl. She is 
due to graduate in May.

Alex Paez and Aubrey Burris speak about transparency issues when applying to be appointed as a UF Supreme Court justice at the Student Senate meeting Tuesday night.fessors were limited on how 
many assignments they could put online for on-campus stu-dents. He said the professors now have control over whether 
they want all of their quizzes 
and tests online or if they want to host live lectures.
Although UF Online has 
given the college more stu-dents, Tucker said, no new faculty have been hired. There aren’t enough professors to 
split courses for UF Online and 
traditional students.
Some on-campus students 
are also upset about ProctorU becoming a part of their online classes.
ProctorU is an online proc-
toring solution for tests. A com-pany employee observes stu-dents via webcam while they 
take their exams.
Although the cost of Proc-
torU is covered by the univer-
sity for online students, on-campus students have to pay the difference, which changes for each class.
Amanda Jackson, a 21-year-
old UF telecommunications junior, has already taken two exams through ProctorU.Jackson held up her webcam 
and turned it in a circle for the proctor to check her room for textbooks or notes. She also had 
to show the proctor two types 
of photo identification and hold up a mirror so he could see her laptop screen.
“I didn’t like having to go 
through all that,” she said.
Tucker said it’s also a pro-
fessor’s decision to use Proc-torU or have live tests. He said 
online proctoring is similar to 
proctoring in a classroom.
“When you’re on cam-
pus taking an exam there are eyes on you all the time,” he said. “With ProctorU, it’s just through a webcam.”
Tawnya Means, director of 
the Center for Teaching, Learn-
ing and Assessment in War-
rington, said that the business college’s fluid course structure is due to its transition from Sakai to the new online plat-form Canvas.
Means said all 22 courses for 
the college’s online bachelor’s degree will be transferred to 
Canvas by Spring 2015.
“It’s a little bit of a bumpy 
road while we transition,” she 
said. “But in the end, life will be better for everyone.”tration has given more loans to 
small business owners in the past five years than any other admin-istration. 
“The best measure of opportu-
nity is access to a good job,” he said.
He additionally urged busi-
nesses to raise the wages they pay employees. He said he plans to sign an executive order “re-
quiring federal contractors to pay 
their federally funded employees a fair wage of at least $10.10 an hour.” He hopes other employ-
ers will follow his lead and “give 
America a raise.” 
UF College Democrats Presi-
dent Lauren Nikoloff, 20, said after a watch party in the Reitz 
Union Auditorium that organi-
zation members looked forward to the wage increases as well as 
Obama’s intent to equalize wom-
en’s rights in the workplace.
The political science and eco-
nomics junior also said she’s an-
ticipating the president’s plan to 
increase opportunities for low-income college students, espe-cially with his initiative to lay a strong foundation during K-12 
education.
“He’s working hard to make 
sure every American has oppor-
tunities to advance,” she said.
Alachua County Young Re-
publicans President Katy Mel-chiorre said she thought equal pay for women was an important topic, but that she didn’t support 
Obama’s particular plan.
“I don’t believe we need more 
government regulation on my in-
come,” said the 22-year-old first-
year UF law student. 
She said that Obama’s an-
ecdote about a small-business 
owner who personally raised the minimum wage for his employees 
was admirable for that particular 
small business, but she  said she didn’t support his call to raise the federal minimum wage.
Overall, she called the speech  
“just another glorified campaign speech for his politics.”4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 29, 2014

Negotiations are over.
After months of bargaining with the City 
of Gainesville to improve pay for Regional 
Transit System workers, the group protect-
ing bus employees, Amalgamated Transit Union, declared an impasse at the latest city hall proceedings Tuesday afternoon.
Negotiations started in October, but after 
about an hour of discussing contract pro-posals, the union refused to accept the city’s proposed 1.5 percent pay increase.
Mary Frances Folz Donahue, president 
of Gainesville’s ATU chapter, said she was disappointed with the outcome.
“Today they clarified that they’re abso-lutely opposed to any sort of pay progres-sion,” she said. “This is a continuation of 
this failed policy of keeping wages really 
low.”
The union was fighting to get pay pro-
gression in the contract, Donahue said. She said the highest pay an RTS driver can make 
is $16.92 per hour, but the majority are mak-
ing in the $12 to $13 range. 
“You have people that have been there 
for 15 years not making top pay,” she said.
According to calculations made by ATU, 
the average top pay of fixed-rate transit op-erators in Florida and Georgia is an hourly wage of $17.96. RTS wages fall at the bottom of those calculations.
Local activist Jeremiah Tattersall said the 
city needs to consider the numbers.
“Now we have the unfortunate title of 
worst-compensated transit operators in 
Florida and Georgia,” Tattersall said.The city offered the 1.5 percent pay in-
crease for all city workers, but Tattersall said RTS deserves reconsideration because unat-
tractive wages are repelling employees.
“Other city workers don’t have a recruit-
ment problem,” he said. “They don’t have a retention problem like RTS.”
As a result of the deadlock, Donahue 
said a third party appointed by the state will look at both sides and present its find-ings. However, the City Commission will ultimately make the decision after looking 
at the new information. Gainesville’s ATU chapter has about 100 
due-paying members, but represents more than 200 workers, Donahue said.
Before the negotiations, Donahue and 
Tattersall, joined by about 10 unionists, RTS 
workers and UF students, stood at City Hall holding signs for the cause.
“We’re here because we’re betting on 
Gainesville,” Donahue said. “The other side is betting on a recession.”
UF student Eric Brown, a lead organizer 
for Students for a Democratic Society, stood alongside the unionists outside city hall. The 20-year-old political science junior said it was only natural to come out and support RTS workers.
“It’s easy because basically we see bus 
drivers as a key part of our UF experience,” Brown said.
RTS spokesman Chip Skinner declined 
to comment after the meeting.Negotiations between union, city stall over RTS wages

Students have an opportunity 
to win a scholarship just by texting 
a number.
This is Gator Dining’s second 
year conducting the text-to-win 
campaign with Dr Pepper, said Jill 
Rodriguez, the marketing program manager of Gator Dining Services.
Four students will be awarded 
scholarships totaling $7,000 with three $1,000 winners and one $4,000 winner. 
A winner will be announced 
each month during the Spring se-mester. 
The January winner has al-
ready been contacted and will be announced Thursday evening at the Gator Corner Dining Center from 6 to 8 p.m. 
Michael Everette, a 19-year-old 
UF electrical engineering sopho-more, won the Dr Pepper tuition scholarship giveaway last year.
Everette saw an email from Gator Dining Services advertising the giveaway and texted to enter the competition. In late April, he received a call saying he had won the $4,000 scholarship.“It has been nice having some 
extra cash and not taking out as many loans,” Everette said.
Katherine Arellano, a 20-year-
old UF public relations sophomore, won the giveaway last February.
Unlike Everette, Arellano knew 
she could enter the competition multiple times.
“I believe the reason I won was 
that I literally texted that number every single day,” Arellano said.
Winning the scholarship was an 
exciting experience for Arellano.“I was jumping up and down, I 
had never won something like that before,” Arellano said. “I’m not the type of person to win raffles or giveaways.”
Arellano put the money she 
won aside for her summer study abroad trip to London and Paris with the UF’s College of Journal-ism and Communications.
“It was definitely a self-esteem 
booster to have the opportunity to win something like a scholarship,” Arellano said.

In a world where print advertising is vola-
tile, one UF alumna is developing her own ad-
free publication. 
Suzette Cook, 46, released the first issue of 
her new publication, Art & Soul, this month. 
The publication is completely funded by pro-
ceeds from Cook’s antique consignment shop Artsy Smartsy, located at 402 NW 10th Ave., a few blocks north of the Hippodrome State Theatre.   
“I knew I wanted to launch an art maga-
zine,” Cook said. “But I wanted it to be differ-
ent. I’m trying to fund a magazine with a store 
and see if I can surpass advertising.”  
Cook said she wanted to avoid deadlines 
so she can take as much time as she wants to work on a story without pressure from adver-tisers. 
“To think that journalism is going to be 
funded with ad sales,” Cook said, “that’s the archaic model.”Cook also uses her store and the people 
who shop there as catalysts for ideas and in-
spiration for stories, she said. 
Mike Foley, a UF journalism professor, said 
Cook isn’t the first to attempt to release an ad-
free publication.  
“I think she started this store to realize her 
dream of publishing this magazine, and I think that’s terrific,” Foley said.
Ad-free publication has been attempted be-
fore on a grander scale and failed, Foley said.
“The newspapers need a new model,” Fol-
ey said. “The advertising makeup of the news-paper has changed drastically.”
Ayana Stewart, a 20-year-old UF journal-
ism junior and president of the Society of Pro-fessional Journalists, said she admires what Cook is 
doing but questions wheth-
er it is a realistic model for all-print journalism. 
“There’s definitely a pos-
sibility that it could work for her if she continued to expand and fund it without 
advertisement, especially if 
that’s what she’s dedicated to,” Stewart said. 
However, she said she doesn’t see a way 
that major publications could survive without advertisements.
“I think that on a smaller scale, it’s a really 
cool idea,” Stewart said.UF alumna starts advertisement-free Gainesville art magazine

During his visit to the Pablo 
Picasso Museum in Barcelona, 
a UF student thought of an idea that could last for a lifetime.
Jared Kash, a 20-year-old 
junior studying film, advertis-ing and anthropology, created a digital time capsule called Time Flash that is scheduled to launch Feb. 14 in the App Store. It will be available on Google Play in March. 
The “time capsule” will al-
low users to take a picture or 
record a video and send it to 
their select group of contacts. The sender can set the date and time that friends can view it, Kash said.
“The app lets you capture 
and relive an epic night with your friends,” he said.
For example, students may 
want to send posts into the fu-ture from study abroad trips or Spring Break.
“You will be able to see that 
someone sent you a time cap-sule, and we added a count-down for when you can open it,” he said.
Kash was studying abroad with the College of Journal-ism and Communications dur-ing Summer 2012 in Barcelona when he thought of the idea.
“I was looking at a painting 
of a woman at the Pablo Picasso Museum, and I felt a connection with her emotion and beauty,” 
Kash said.
The image made him won-
der how people could digitally 
capture moments for longer. 
Kash took the concept to his 
father, who is an entrepreneur-ship professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. They decided to 
work together to turn the idea 
into a reality.
Courtland McEachrane, a 
21-year-old UF economics ju-nior, has worked with Kash throughout the process, help-ing him promote the app on campus.
“It’s just so easy to want 
to see it flourish and grow,” McEachrane said.
The team has raised $1.5 
million through investors, Kash said. So far, he has 20 represen-tatives at 20 universities around the country who have been pro-moting the launch as well.
Kash said that because he 
worked so hard on the app 
with his father, he will prob-
ably send his first post to family members.Student-created app

UF’s Levin College of Law has 
been selected to host the 33rd Fed-
eralist Society National Student Symposium. It’ll be the first time a student chapter outside of the top 15 
law schools has hosted this event. 
The Symposium is expected to 
attract students and alumni and 
help them connect and discuss top-ics about controversies in security and freedom, according to a press release. 
Devon Westhill, the senior local 
chapter president and chairman of the Symposium Executive Commit-
tee, said it is important for students 
to get involved and become educat-ed on pressing issues.
“To understand complex and im-
portant issues such as the ones that we will discuss and debate at the symposium regarding security, free-dom, and privacy is both interesting and vital for tomorrow’s leaders,” he wrote in an email. 
The Symposium will take place 
March 7 through March 8 in the 
Reitz Union. Tickets are $10 for stu-
dents and $25 for non-students. 
 “It’s also a great opportunity to 
meet other law students and hear their perspective,” said Jillian Pratt, a 22-year-old first-year law student.UF chosen to host law symposium
� THE DOG WASH IS VALENTINE’S DAY THEMED 
AND WILL BE HELD FEB. 8.

A group of UF Veterinary School Students will be 
spreading the love to furry friends this weekend in honor of 
Valentine’s Day.
UF’s College of Veterinary Medicine’s nonprofit 
organization, Project HEAL, will be holding a Valentine’s Day themed dog wash on Feb. 8 at the veterinary school.
“It’s always fun to have a party with a theme at the dog wash,” said Cameron Biggs, president of Project HEAL and 
second-year student at UF’s veterinary school.
A donation of $5 will gets dogs a bath, nail trimming and 
ear cleaning. 
Steven Bingert, vice president and treasurer for Project 
HEAL and second-year graduate student at UF’s veterinary 
school, said turnout for the dog washes last semester was 
great.
“There may not have been 200 people,” he said, “but 
there was definitely 200-plus dogs there.”
All donations will be used to fund Project HEAL’s 
annual trip to Ecuador, where members care for animals in 
underprivileged communities.Last year, members performed about 60 surgeries and 
more than 200 vaccinations, Bingert said.
Students like Biggs and Bingert, who have yet to go on 
the trip, said they’re looking forward to experiencing the passion of the locals for their pets. 
“They really love their animals,” Biggs said. “They’ll get 
there at 7 in the morning and wait for as long as they have to. They’re really grateful.”Puppy’s day out: UF Veterinary group hosts dog-wash eventCook

Americans want 
female leads
In 2013, female-driven ﬁ  lms killed in the box ofﬁ  ce. TIME  
magazine reported that movies released last year passing 
the Bechdel test made $1.55 billion more than movies that 
didn’t. The Bechdel test, for those of you who aren’t fans of 
the “Dykes to Watch Out For” comic strip, is a standard that works of ﬁ  ction are held to in order to determine gender bias. 
Films, books, TV shows and other forms of entertainment 
pass the Bechdel test if they contain two or more named fe-
male characters, the female characters speak to one another, 
and their conversations are about something other than men 
or relationships. 
In general, a shockingly low number of ﬁ  lms pass the 
Bechdel test. A running list of these movies is updated on bechdeltest.com. Even though Bechdel test-approved movies 
in 2013 brought in some serious cash at the box ofﬁ  ce — think 
“Catching Fire,” “American Hustle” and “Frozen” — they accounted for only 36 percent of the top 50 highest-grossing 
movies. 
The “if you build it, they will come” principle counts when 
it comes to women-driven movies. It’s clear that there’s a de-
mand from the public for female action stars, comedians and dramatic actors. Then why are so few movies immune to gen-
der bias?
The sad reality is that even in 2013, most major Hollywood 
studios — and most TV networks — rely on tired stereotypes 
when crafting female characters. Although news outlets are 
quick to tout the successes of movies showcasing deep, witty 
female characters, 36 percent isn’t nearly enough. 
Furthermore, the Bechdel test isn’t exactly the be-all, end-
all standard we should be holding the entertainment industry 
to; it’s merely a jumping-off point. It’s not enough to ask for 
a minimum of two characters who brieﬂ  y have conversations 
that don’t revolve around the ever-present “him.” Holly-
wood needs ﬁ  lms with female stars who reﬂ  ect women in real 
life, and women in real life don’t concoct zany plans to trap 
men or stand idly by while male superheroes save the world. 
For example, this year the buddy cop ﬂ  ick “The Heat” was a 
high-grossing ﬁ  lm that passed the Bechdel test, but its suc-
cess was purely commercial. Rotten Tomatoes gave it just a 66 percent rating, and The New Yorker and the Village Voice gave it poor reviews.
The future looks bright for 2014, however. Highly antici-
pated ﬁ  lms such as “Divergent,” “Veronica Mars,” “Maleﬁ  -cent” and “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part I” rep-resent some serious strides forward in the ﬁ  lm industry’s 
women problem. Sales last year showed that audiences want 
to see female characters on screen getting their hands dirty 
and ﬁ  ghting evil — with or without a Prince Charming. Mon-
ey talks, as they say, and perhaps Hollywood execs are ﬁ  nally beginning to listen.Football and the concussion paradox
Right now, the big buzzword for the NFL is “con-cussion.” It’s hard not to hear about it. Ever since the book and documentary “League of Denial” 
entered into the sports media arena, concerns for player safety and head-related injuries intensiﬁ  ed. The word is in the back of every fan’s, coach’s and player’s mind. I challenge you to ﬁ  nd a game where the word “concus-sion” has not been brought up by the play-by-play or color commentator.   
When the Chiefs took on the Colts in the ﬁ  rst week 
of the playoffs, the Chiefs’ star running back Jamaal Charles remained on the ground, motionless, during an opening drive play. After a few uneasy moments, the training staff checked him out. The result: concussion.   
When the Saints played the Eagles, a Saints corner-
back tried to lay a punishing hit on an Eagles wide re-ceiver, only to have induced a concussion himself.  
Fast forward a week to when the Saints took on 
the Seahawks. Seahawks wide receiver Percy Harvin passed a concussion test after a hard illegal hit by a Saints safety. Later in the game, he slammed his head on the ground trying unsuccessfully to catch a touch-down pass — concussion. This time, he remained on the sideline for the rest of the game. 
Forget hearing about players getting concussions. 
We can see it happen every game. 
This season in particular, many NFL watchers — my-
self included — saw the league through a different lens. It was hard not to see or read about a former player talking about his debilitating health condition and dete-riorating mental capabilities because of his once-grand football career. And when you’re in the stands watching the games, you begin to worry about it yourself.  
I sat in amazement watching player after player 
struggling to pick himself off the ground, staggering off to the sidelines, then tripping over himself and fall-ing back down after a play is whistled dead. In the not-so-distant past, some players would sit on the sidelines after such an act and get back on the ﬁ  eld a few plays later. Yes, the league has taken steps to mak-ing the game safer. It changed the rules about how a player can tackle, prevents hits on the quarterback, and such. But fans 
are still amazed at the amount of head injuries players take. 
In the postseason, it is a completely different game. 
Whether you think NFL players lack passion for the game, you play to win when you are in the playoffs — emphasis on the word “play.” Regardless if you will re-gret going back on the ﬁ  eld after a bone-crushing hit or hitting your head hard on the turf, you want to play in some of the biggest games of your career. Nothing, not even concerns of concussions, will get in your way. 
Despite the concussion scrutiny, football remains the 
most popular game in the country. Though we balk at admitting it, we watch the game for the big hits. We want to see two grown men hurdle themselves at each other at top speed. We want to hear the crowd cheer in unison after a fullback runs over a linebacker for the game-winning touchdown.  
We fans live in this paradox: We advocate player 
safety yet complain about the “wussiﬁ  cation” of the game. But the players too live in a paradox — they want to hit and play hard, yet they want to be immune from injury in later life. Concussions will be a problem for the league and its public relations team for years to come. Until this problem is solved for good, we have to accept this unfortunate reality.

Last week in Virginia, a group of gun-
control activists planned to hold a rally at the Virginia State Capitol. The 
protesters were turned away by Capitol Po-lice, who informed them that the sticks on the American ﬂ  ags that they carried were forbidden inside the building because they could be considered weapons.
Meanwhile, another group of visitors to 
the Capitol walked swiftly and freely through the door-way. This group was made up of members of the Virgin-ia Citizens Defense League and other pro-gun activist organizations. 
The pro-gun citizens were visiting the Capitol as part 
of a Guns Save Lives event. According to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, about half of the pro-gun group was armed with weapons ranging from handguns to assault riﬂ  es.
This incident is illustrative of the hallowed, almost di-
vine status of ﬁ  rearms in American society. Groups like the National Riﬂ  e Association have worked tirelessly to promote the image of the responsible gun owner as the ideal patriotic American citizen.
After the tragic killing of 20 children and six teachers 
on Dec. 14, 2012, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Mass., NRA executive vice president Wayne LaPierre immediately announced the organization’s wholehearted opposition to any potential proposals for gun regulation. 
Instead, LaPierre argued, the solution was to bring 
more guns into the mix by putting armed guards into every school in America. 
“The best way to stop a bad guy with a gun,” he said, 
is with “a good guy with a gun.”
Lawmakers in Congress aligned themselves with the 
NRA’s absolutist, anti-gun control stance and failed to pass a single new ﬁ  rearm regulation in the aftermath of Sandy Hook.
The fallibility of LaPierre’s plan was exposed in Janu-
ary 2013, when an armed guard at Chatﬁ  eld School in Lapeer, Mich., left his loaded gun in a school bathroom. This incident demonstrated the obvious: Even the most responsible gun owner is prone to lapses in judgment or memory. When ﬁ  rearms are involved, such mistakes have potentially devastating consequences.
Since the massacre at Sandy Hook, at least 194 more 
children have died as a result of gun violence, 127 of them in their own homes. Guns did not keep these chil-dren safe. Guns killed these children. One possible solution to the problem of 
gun deaths in American homes would be to encourage pediatricians, who are directly involved in ensuring the health of America’s children, to inform parents about the impor-tance of gun safety in the household.
Naturally, gun-rights advocates have 
sought to silence these vital stewards of our children’s health and safety. A law passed 
by the Florida Legislature in 2011 could result in $10,000 ﬁ  nes and other penalties for doctors who have conversa-tions about guns with their patients. Gov. Rick Scott’s administration is currently defending the law in the Florida court system. 
The popularity of these dangerous and foolish laws 
among the pro-gun community demonstrates that the safety of children is not the advocates’ primary concern. 
Those who support sensible gun regulations, such as 
universal background checks and bans on certain kinds of assault weapons, must become much more forceful in their own advocacy if they are to have any chance of success.
Pro-life conservatives constantly rail against the Su-
preme Court’s ruling in Roe v. Wade, which held that women have a constitutionally protected right to an abortion. Nearly every Republican presidential candi-date in recent memory has expressed a desire to see Roe overturned by a more conservative Court.
What if, in a similar manner, advocates of gun regula-
tion attacked the Court’s ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller, which reafﬁ  rmed the individual right to bear arms? These activists might argue that the rights out-lined by the Second Amendment are not intended for individuals at all, but only apply to the “well regulated Militia” referenced in the amendment’s text. 
Such an effort to redeﬁ  ne the Second Amendment 
might not be ultimately successful, but it would help challenge the notion of the individual right to bear arms as a central and inarguable tenet of our society. This con-versation would put political pressure on Congress to take action and help pave the way for new gun-control regulations, many of which are supported by the vast majority of the American people. 
If America continues to place the gun sacred above 
all else, even above the safety and well-being of our chil-dren, then the shootings and the slaughter will continue unabated.

Whether for taking notes, writing papers or wast-
ing time in class, it’s generally accepted that a laptop is necessary for survival in the classroom.
For students who are looking 
for a computer that can meet all 
their needs without a bookstore 
price, Google’s Chromebook may be the answer.
Chromebooks run Google’s 
Chrome operating system, which is essentially the Chrome web browser with a few built-in web apps. It utilizes Google Cloud, so you don’t have to worry about losing your ﬁ  les or backing things up. You’ll have to forget your grand plans of simultaneously writing 10 papers while di-
recting U.S. military satellites from your dorm, but in this 
case, less is more.
All of the needs of typical students are accommodated 
by Google’s range of productivity tools. Need to write a paper or take notes?  Google Docs allows you to not only create documents, but also easily collaborate with others — an excellent tool for creating group study guides. Google’s ofﬁ  ce suites include tools for creating spreadsheets and slideshows, comparable to Excel and PowerPoint.
Want to listen to music? You can buy songs through 
Google Play or sync your iTunes library, then listen through the Cloud. And for your typical time-wasting activities, the Chrome browser is lightweight and fast. After a few weeks of use, the battery life is still sufﬁ  cient to manage a full day of classes.
However, the Chromebook does have its limitations. 
The Chrome OS means Mac and PC software can’t be in-stalled, and the lack of processing power makes it a no-go 
for students doing high-level design or editing work. But 
for the average student just looking for a computer to occa-sionally work on, the Chromebook is a cheap, cost-effective option that is deﬁ  nitely worth taking a look at. Just think — you’ll never have to explain to the folks how your $1200 Macbook was stolen because you didn’t take the univer-sity’s advice and lock it while sleeping in the library.

As a sophomore 
approaching her gilded 
20s with no shiny career plans, I have 
grievances with Lena 
Dunham’s work. A show with intentions to expose the struggle of being a girl in her 20s should have relatable characters, and the lack of a truly relatable “girl” is a gaping hole. I guess we are supposed to relate to Hannah because she calls herself “the voice of her generation,” but do girls really want to relate to 
Hannah, a girl struggling with 
OCD and a boyfriend everyone calls an asshole?
A few “universal truth” lines 
don’t make up for a character who’s hard to like. And what’s the point of a show with unlik-
able characters? Some say that 
the unlikable characters make the show more realistic, but I beg to differ. Are most people really as selﬁ  sh and disorganized as the characters of “Girls”?
The problems I have  be-
gan to surface when I watched “Frances Ha,” a ﬁ  lm that does all the things “Girls” tries to do.
“Frances Ha” made 
me realize that the 
problem with “Girls,” 
along with the lack of likable 
and relatable characters, is its nature as a TV drama. Depicting the postgrad crisis in a TV show is simply cruel. It’s cruel because the girls can’t ﬁ  gure out their lives until the show is canceled. And based on its popularity, these girls aren’t getting their lives together anytime soon.
Then again, does anybody 
actually enjoy realistic TV? No one would watch a show about graduates from a respectable university with applicable skill sets and rigid, achievable goals. People love to watch other peo-
ple tumble into failure. I feel like 
I’m watching a stretched-out and dramatized version of my own impending doom.

Universal Orlando renderings show the Wizarding World of Harry Potter — Diagon Alley, which is scheduled to open this 
summer. The new section of the park will be connected via the Hogwarts Express train.

This summer, UF Muggles can hop 
aboard the Hogwarts Express for the first 
time in wizarding history.
Universal Orlando Resort recently an-
nounced that the Wizarding World of Harry 
Potter — Diagon Alley will open this sum-
mer with new Harry Potter attractions.
The second Harry Potter-themed park 
will connect to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter — Hogsmeade via the Hog-warts Express train. The train will take park patrons from London’s King’s Cross Sta-tion in Universal to Hogsmeade station in Islands of Adventure. Park-to-park admis-
sion will be required to ride the train.
The Hogwarts Express train is one of 
several new attractions spellbinding UF 
students. The new park will include Har-ry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts, where riders go on an adventure through Gringotts vaults.
Ashley McDowell, an 18-year-old UF international studies freshman and Florida Quidditch team member, said she loved the first park and is already planning to visit the new park.
“The first time I went, I cried because 
I was so excited,” McDowell said. “I can’t wait to go on the Hogwarts Express.”
McDowell said she believes the addition 
will get more people interested in the world of Harry Potter.
“It’s always super exciting to be in the 
wizarding world,” she said.
Karrie Ballis, an 18-year-old UF applied 
physiology and kinesiology freshman, said she hopes the park is even better than the Hogsmeade park.“I was disappointed with the first park 
—  it needs to be more like the books,” she said. “I hope the rides will be better.”
Muggles can also shop at Madam Mal-
kin’s Robes for All Occasions or seek out the Quality Quidditch Supplies shop for a more 
sporty wizard look.  
“Hopefully the Quidditch store will get 
more kids excited about the actual sport of 
Quidditch,” McDowell said.
Florida Quidditch team member Rich-
ard Crumrine, a 20-year-old UF family youth and community science junior, said he thinks the expansion will help visitors immerse themselves in the world of Harry 
Potter. 
Crumrine said even though the books 
and movies are finished, he is thrilled that 
the legacy of Harry Potter continues with the parks.
“Our children’s children who did not 
grow up in the era of Harry Potter will still know how much of an impact it made on our generation,” he said.Students spellbound by Harry Potter park plans

Gators will join the fight against breast 
cancer with Gainesville’s first race ben-
efiting Susan G. Komen for the Cure.
Registration for the March 23 race is 
open and will close March 21.
Two groups, UF’s American Medical 
Student Association chapter and Florida Blue Key, are coordinating the event.
The race is not affiliated with the foun-
dation, but money raised will be donated to its North Florida affiliate, said North Florida Komen Executive Director Delo-res Wise. Organizers couldn’t host an of-ficial Race for the Cure because Alachua 
County doesn’t have a Komen affiliate.
Race co-director Elizabeth Ortega said 
organizers are hoping for 1,000 people.
“I had a dream of bringing Susan G. 
Komen to Gainesville because I noticed it 
wasn’t here,” the 20-year-old UF biology and psychology sophomore said.  
The main event is $25 for UF and Sante 
Fe College students, $20 for participants 
17 and under, and $30 for adults.
The 5K course will start on Flavet Field 
and circle around Lake Alice, she said.
Since the foundation drew criticism 
for temporarily cutting funding for 
Planned Parenthood, its spending habits have been criticized. But Ortega said stu-dents have responded well to the race.
Emily Hays, 19-year-old UF applied 
physiology and kinesiology sophomore, is participating in the Gainesville race with her mother, who’s been breast-can-cer free for four years.
“Because it’s so well known, more 
people are more likely to donate and get involved,” she said.Student

founders, AJ Nelson and Joe Dallago, launched a Spring expansion to its year-old web-site that includes more than 52 schools, including UF.
“The medium allows stu-

The site allows students to 
upload and share documents in preparation for exams, as well as discuss class-related issues on a class wall.
Nelson said they chose UF 
due to the size of its student population.
The number of UF students 
enrolled on the site has reached 425, but Stephanie D’Amico, a 22-year-old UF journalism ju-nior, is hesitant.

Students can pledge to reduce 
their ecological footprints this 
Spring with Sustainable UF.
The Office of Sustainability will 
be giving out free hot chocolate and 
reusable mugs to kick off its Spring 
campaign, Turn Over a New Leaf, on Turlington Plaza on Feb. 10 from 9 to 11:30 a.m.
The campaign encourages UF 
students, faculty and staff to reduce their ecological footprints in one of the largest areas of resource con-sumption: energy, food, transporta-
tion and waste.
“If everyone lived the lifestyle of 
the average American, we would 
need the resources of almost five planets,” said Anabel Mendez, a 21-year-old UF public relations se-nior and intern at the Office of Sus-tainability.
Mendez said the main goal is 
to help people create lifelong hab-its that support a more sustainable lifestyle.
Laurel Nesbit, the Office of Sus-
tainability program assistant, said the office is encouraging students 
to reduce their footprints one cat-
egory at a time in order to make the process more simple.
“You’re going to be so over-
whelmed,” she said. “You’ll quit at everything because it requires you to change every aspect with the way that you interact with the world.”
Nesbit said the Office of Sustain-
ability is hoping to get 1,000 people signed up for the campaign.
“We’re hoping to get a lot of 
people signed up and actually en-gage in changing their behaviors,” she said.
People can sign up to pledge on 
the Sustainable UF website. They will receive biweekly emails with tips on how to lower their individ-ual footprints.
Tonty Rutinel, a 19-year-old UF 
microbiology and cell science ju-nior, said he pledged to reduce his food consumption.
“I know that the biggest envi-
ronmental impact on the planet is from our inefficiency in our food system,” he said.Sustainable UF aims to reduce footprints“The first time I went I cried

Nestled among the trees that 
line Radio Road sits a faded, yel-
low brick building and a well-kept 
secret.
A third of the structure is ﬁ  lled 
wall to wall with used items: 
printers, televisions, refrigerators 
and chalkboards.
It’s not an antique shop or a junk store. It’s the UF Surplus 
Warehouse, under the administra-tion of the Division of Finance and 
Accounting’s Asset Management 
department.
Last ﬁ  scal year, the warehouse 
saved the university $2 million, 
and with the increase in faculty 
hires this year, staff expects to see even more items entering and leaving the facility. “You’d think we’re the trash 
men, but we’re actually something different,” said Michael Stringer, 
administrative services coordi-
nator for the warehouse. “We’re trying to repurpose items — give them new life or new use. It’s our 
passion.”
The warehouse staff collects 
used equipment from UF’s facili-
ties to redistribute, resell or recycle to UF buildings, faculty members 
and the general public.
Everything in the warehouse 
is recycled, from the employees’ 
desks and computers to their ﬁ  l-
ing cabinets and even cars.
The warehouse started out as a 
necessity 10 years ago.
University protocol requires an 
establishment where used or dam-aged goods are disposed.
Since Stringer joined the staff 
in 2011, the branch has saved the 
university millions of dollars by 
reusing and recycling scrap parts 
and listing items on online auc-tions. 
Scrap parts have earned the 
university about $75,000, and on-
line auctions contribute an addi-
tional $300,000, Stringer said.
Any ofﬁ  cial UF facility can give 
items to the warehouse. After the 
items are assessed to make sure 
they meet the safety requirements of the UF Environmental Health and Safety department, goods are sent to Stringer and his crew for 
sorting.
Reusable items are redistribut-
ed on the UF campus, and surplus items are put up for auction and sold to the public.
Items that don’t fall under 
these categories are either donated 
to nonproﬁ  t organizations or sold 
for scrap.
Gretchen Fisk, a 19-year-old UF 
telecommunication sophomore, 
said she thinks the warehouse helps campus be more sustain-
able.
“I think they should get the 
word out,” she said. “Especially if 
the money they’re saving is in the 
millions, I think it’s a great idea.”
Sherry Adams, the asset man-
agement accounting coordinator, 
said Stringer is a leading activist in promoting campus sustainabil-
ity.
 “He is very instrumental in his 
ﬁ  eld,” she said.
Through their efforts, Stringer 
and his team said they hope to 
help meet President Bernie Ma-chen’s goal for UF to have zero waste by 2015.
“It’s hard to think long term, but 
we do,” Adams said. “What we do here pays dividends to come, and that’s what UF is all about.” WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 29, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Alligator Writer @EricaAlyssa 
There is more to a perfect 10 than meets 
the eye — which is why the Gators have ac-
complished the feat only 17 times in the pro-
gram’s 41 years of existence. 
But on Friday, Bridget Sloan and Kytra 
Hunter made it look easy.  
Sloan and Hunter’s back-to-back ﬂ  oor 
performances scored perfect 10s with the 
judges in Florida’s ﬁ  rst home meet of the year against Georgia. 
In collegiate gymnastics, the key to a 
strong scoring ﬂ  oor routine is balancing ac-
robatics and choreography. 
There are some basics all ﬂ  oor routines 
follow. Gymnasts can choose any instrumen-tal song, which is cut down to no more than 1:30 minutes. Each ﬂ  oor routine must in-clude at least two acrobatic series, and one of 
those must contain two saltos or somersault. Tumbling passes, leaps and jumps are also 
required.
If a routine does not meet these standards, 
it’s an automatic .10 deduction. Other deduc-
tions can come from as small of a mistake as stepping out of bounds or having a concen-
tration pause longer than two seconds. 
Within these guidelines, gymnasts are al-
lowed more freedom than in any other event. 
With that freedom, Hunter and Sloan dem-
onstrated their ability, creativity and desire 
to have fun. 
When it comes to Sloan’s routine, not 
much has changed. Sloan said her passes are 
all the same as the passes from her freshman-
year ﬂ  oor routine, but this season, she is hav-
ing more fun. 
“The ﬂ  oor routine that I do here — it’s not 
really all about the difﬁ  culty, but it’s about 
showing it off,” Sloan said. 
“The one that I have right now, it get’s the 
crowd into it.”This year, Sloan utilized her song choice 
— the White Stripes’ hit “Seven Nation Army” — as a way to get the crowd involved in her performance.  
Sloan’s routine follows her song’s lead — it starts slowly and then builds. Sloan starts 
out lying down on the ground and does 
not stand until the 20-second mark of her 1:30-minute routine. 
“When my music starts, everybody knows that song,” Sloan said. “I get this intense look 
and sassiness going. I think the beginning is 
my all-time favorite.”

Since Damontre Harris re-enrolled at 
Florida at the start of the semester, he has 
so far been successful in his attempts to work his way back into coach Billy Don-ovan’s good graces.
Donovan said Monday that Har-
ris, who was dismissed from the team last month, has practiced with the No. 3 Gators every day in a role on the scout team imitating opposing teams’ frontcourt players. The center has lifted weights and gone through individual in-struction at UF’s basketball facility while the team is in the midst of its Southeast-
ern Conference slate.
Although Harris has done everything 
that is asked of him, Donovan reafﬁ  rmed the center will not play for the team this 
season. 
“He’s doing everything else every-
body else is doing, except he is not on the bench during games,” Donovan said. 
“He is not going to play any games, 
but everything else he is doing right now. He’s got an opportunity to salvage. It’s disappointing to me; (he’s) a guy that sat out an entire year to jeopardize him-self like that in terms of his behavior.”
Harris was originally dismissed from 
the Gators on Dec. 21, 2013, after not practicing with the team for about two months and being suspended for UF’s Harris practicing with UFWOMEN’S BASKETBALL

Alligator Writer @GordonStreisand
The Gators are one of the smallest teams 
in the Southeastern Conference. 
But forward Kayla Lewis helps make 
up for the height discrepancy by grabbing nearly any rebound she can get her hands 
on. 
The 6-foot redshirt junior has accounted 
for nearly a quarter of her team’s total re-
bounds this season — averaging a not-so-paltry 8.5 boards per contest — all the while averaging double-ﬁ  gures in scoring. 
Lewis has shown considerable growth 
from last season, during which she averaged 5.5 rebounds and 7.2 points per game.
She led or tied for the team lead in re-
bounding 11 times last year, including NIT play. This season, Lewis has led or tied for the team lead in rebounding 12 times, and it is only halfway through the conference schedule.
“Kayla’s always known 
what she’s capable of be-
ing as a rebounder, and 
I think she’s realizing it and making it happen,” coach Amanda Butler said. “She loves the fact that she’s smaller than most of 
the people she’s going up 
against. That’s part of what fuels her, but I think the ultimate fuel for her is accepting 
and pursuing the fact that she can rebound 
in a different way than anyone else on our team can. She’s got to do that for us to be effective, especially against these folks who are giving up inches — a lot of time in every position.
“She’s a little bit of a ﬂ  yweight, too. It’s 
not just inches she’s giving up.”Forward racking up boards

SEE W-HOOPS, PAGE 14SEE HOOPS, PAGE 14SEE GYM, PAGE 14Sloan’s first pass may not look as difficult, 
but it is just as hard as Hunter’s, coach Rhon-
da Faehn said.
She added that both first passes are consid-
ered “E,” which is the highest degree of dif-ficulty for collegiate gymnasts. 
The most notable moves in Sloan’s routine 
include a front double twist, back one-and-
one-half twist to front layout and a double pike (a seated move where the gymnast is 
bent only at the hips). 
“Her execution is near perfection,” Faehn 
said. 
“Every single time she gets up there, there’s 
not much for the judges to deduct.”
While Sloan is working on being sassy, 
Hunter’s theme is power. 
“I am powerful, so I’m worrying about 
not over-rotating or going too hard,” Hunter 
said. 
This year, Hunter’s floor routine is set to 
“Damage Intended” by Gramatik, an elec-tronic producer. Hunter has used Gramatik’s “Solidified” for her sophomore-year floor rou-
tine. In 2012 and 2013, Hunter’s floor routine 
scored as high as 9.975 each year. 
As for what made the difference this year, 
Hunter said she’s having more fun on the 
floor. 
Her routine includes a double layout with 
a one-and-a-half twisting front layout into 
a Shushunova (a straddle jump to land in a 
front-lying support), as well as an open dou-
ble tuck.
“Kytra has just an incredible amount of 
power and she’s doing probably the hardest 
tumbling in a floor routine in collegiate gym-
nastics,” Faehn said. 
“She’s combined some great artistry in 
there with it and her dance has really been a highlight, so I think that combination of that 
helped her this past weekend.”14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 29, 2014

Kayla Lewis drives toward the net during Florida’s win against Georgia on Jan. 
19 in the O’Connell Center. Lewis has a quarter of UF’s rebounds this season.
Harris will not play for Florida until 2014-15
first 11 games — including a home exhi-
bition — for violating team rules. At the time, Florida granted Harris permission to transfer to the school of his choice without restrictions, but the 6-foot-10 South Caro-
lina transfer declined.
During the holiday break, Harris had a 
change of heart. 
He felt like he had “made a big mis-
take,” according to Donovan, and he want-
ed a shot to work his way back.
“Over the holidays, it was laid out pret-
ty clear to him if he wanted to come back this is what he needed to do,” Donovan 
said. “In doing so he was going to lose a 
whole year basically, and he still wanted to do it.
“His behavior and what he has been 
doing at least up until this point since he’s been back, since the break, has been posi-tive.”
During his redshirt season at UF, Har-
ris dealt with multiple issues — including a torn labrum, high ankle sprain, strep throat and an arrest for failing to appear in court on a traffic violation. 
Overall, he practiced about only 10-12 
times.
But a year prior at South Carolina, Har-
ris was a regular contributor for the Game-
cocks. 
During his sophomore season in Co-
lumbia, S.C., he started 30 games at center 
and averaged 6.8 points and 5.5 rebounds per contest. He recorded 71 blocks, which tied for second in the SEC behind Ken-tucky’s Anthony Davis — a future No. 1 overall pick in the NBA Draft.
Harris could make an impact in 2014-
15 for the Gators, who will lose frontcourt players Patric Young, Casey Prather and Will Yeguete to graduation after this sea-
son ends. 
But if Donovan sticks to his code, Harris 
will have to wait awhile to see the floor.
Donovan was asked Monday if he 
would bring Harris back in March if the 
team needed the towering center’s pres-ence in the postseason. 
His response?“It would completely devalue what 
our core values are here in terms of what we are trying to do each and every day,” Donovan said. 
“We have too many guys like Patric 
Young and Yeguete and Prather and those guys who have been committed for years, really working and doing the right things. And for us to all the sudden inject him back in there because he may be able to help our 
team — we’ve done fine without him.” hooPS , from page 13
Lewis helping Gators stick together
Lewis’ play on the court has improved dra-
matically, no question. But the role she has taken 
off the court has also increased from years past and has become pivotal to the team’s morale. 
“I just see a different demeanor, especially 
in Kayla,” senior Jaterra Bonds said. “I’ve never seen her act and do some of the things she’s done in my four years here. I’m proud of her. She’s putting in extra work, inviting people to go shoot. It’s just a new version of Kayla that I’m loving right now.”
This season, Florida is 3-1 when Lewis leads 
the team in scoring. When she leads or ties for the team lead in rebounding, the Gators are 
9-3. 
In other words, when Lewis is on her game, 
so is the rest of her team. However, that may 
hinge more on her role in the locker room than her role on the floor. 
“Kayla Lewis is the one who leads our prayer 
in the locker room before we come out,” Butler 
said. “Part of her prayer involved us enjoying 
what we’re doing and remembering that this is fun and this is a blessing. It was a different way of perceiving competition because it gets so heated. Every game, every possession just matters so much and it is easy to get caught up in the negative side of your emotions some-times.”
Butler and her team were noticeably more 
jocular on the sidelines against Auburn this past Sunday than in games prior, and the pre-game prayer was most likely a significant contribu-
tor to that. Florida broke out if its three-game 
slump that afternoon and had one of its best of-fensive performances of the season. 
“We wanted to stay composed,” Butler said. 
“I think when you stay composed, you stay re-laxed. It’s an effective way to handle the adver-sity that we know is going to come, regardless of who we’re playing.”W-hooPS , from page 13gym , from page 13Hunter enjoying

With the ITA Kickoff Cham-
pionship behind them, the No. 2 
Gators’ season has not been a story 
of experience, repetition or expect-
ed outcomes. Instead, it has been a story of freshmen and firsts.
After two straight wins, the 
Gators are not complaining.
“We’re off to a pretty good start, 
I think,” coach Roland Thornqvist said. “We’ve played pretty well, but we’ve shown some nerves 
maybe at times.”
Florida got off to a solid start 
in its first two dual matches of the 
season, winning both without giv-
ing up a single point to either Lou-
isville or Harvard.
During the weekend, seniors 
Alexandra Cercone and Olivia Janowicz each played at the No. 
1 spot — previously reserved for 
former All-American Lauren Em-bree — for the first time in their careers. In addition, freshmen 
Kourtney Keegan, Stefani Stojic 
and Belinda Woolcock all com-peted in dual matches for the first time, but they played important roles on the team despite their lack 
of experience.
“It’s different,” Stojic said. 
“It’s never happened before, but I 
think all of us freshmen are ready for what’s ahead of us. I think it should be good.”
So far it has been, especially for 
Stojic.  
The freshman clinched both 
of the Gators’ matches at the ITA Kickoff, winning all four sets she played.
In addition, Keegan made a 
strong debut, notching straight 6-0 sets against Harvard’s Amanda Lin on Sunday. 
Keegan was the second Gator 
to wrap up her singles match, clearing the way for Stojic to seal the win.
The freshmen and the rest of 
the Florida squad will look to carry its two-game winning streak into its matches against UCF (1-0) today and No. 19 Baylor (6-0) on Saturday.
“You knew this week coming 
up, with these two matches, was going to be busy for us,” Thorn-qvist said. “The hay is sort of in 
the barn for us now as far as actual 
work. It’s more about getting your body ready, your mind ready and maybe polish up a thing or two. We’re going to do some doubles, 
maybe play some more points.”
Aside from gaining experience 
for the freshmen, who comprise almost half the team, playing bet-
ter in doubles is an important goal for Thornqvist in the upcoming matches.
“That’s always our goal,” the 12th-year coach said.
Expect the Gators to continue 
experimenting with new pairs in doubles when they host the Knights at 3 p.m. today at the Ring 
Tennis Complex.

� HILL MAKING 19.2 PERCENT 
OF HIS THREE-POINTERS.
LANDON WATNICK
Alligator Staff Writer @LandonWatnick
Throughout his freshman cam-
paign, point guard Kasey Hill’s shoot-
ing touch from beyond the arc has not been the smoothest.
Hill has thrived in transition this 
season for the No. 3 Gators, shooting 46.4 percent inside the arc largely be-cause most of his two-point attempts are layups. But from three-point range, the McDonald’s All-American from Umatilla has made only 5 of his 26 attempts (19.2 percent) — the worst mark on the team from a player who has taken at least 25 three-point 
shots.
Since the start of 2014, Hill has 
made only two of his 13 attempts 
from downtown. 
“He hasn’t shot the ball great, 
which is OK,” coach Billy Donovan said. “Most freshmen are going to be up and down.”
But while Hill’s shooting from the 
outside has lacked, other aspects of his game have impressed Donovan dur-ing Southeastern Conference play. 
Hill has averaged 4.8 points and 3.3 assists against 1.8 turnovers in 26 minutes per game in the conference slate. 
Throughout the 2013-14 season, 
Hill has averaged 6.5 points — sixth most on the team — 3.3 assists and 1.6 turnovers per game. While Hill is on the floor, he has earned an assist on 
25.6 percent of Florida’s made field 
goals, according to KenPom.com. That assist rate ranks highest on Flor-ida and 207th in the country.
In 15 games, the 6-foot freshman 
has also notched 20 steals, the third most on Florida. Hill’s steal percent-age — a statistic that divides a player’s steals total by the number of defensive 
possessions he plays — ranks 129th in 
the nation, according to KenPom.com
Donovan was pleased with Hill’s 
performances in Florida’s most recent wins last week against Alabama and Tennessee. 
Coming off the bench, Hill scored a 
combined 8 points on 3-of-9 shooting during both games, but also recorded 
four rebounds and five assists against 
only two turnovers.
“I think he’s playing more aggres-
sive,” Donovan said. “When things don’t go well, he has a tendency to carry it to the next play. I think he’s moving out of that maturity-wise.”Freshman point guard

After the golf team’s fourth-place finish in 
the Florida Challenge on Monday, redshirt 
sophomore Katie Mitchell and her team-
mates are looking to improve in their first 
three-round tournament in Palos Verdes, Ca-lif., on Feb. 9-11.
“We were all disappointed in how we 
played,” Mitchell said. “But we took a lot from it and it made us really hungry to get back to work and get ready for California in two weeks.”
Mitchell, who celebrated her 21st birth-
day the day of the tournament, attributed the Gators’ disappointing performance to poor weather during the first round and the dif-ficulty of the course.
“The greens at Black Diamond are dif-
ficult,” she said. “They were in really good shape and receptive. They were mowed pretty tight, so the ball was spinning and the break of the putts was tricky. 
“The beginning was a little rough with the 
weather, there was fog so you couldn’t see the ball real well and it was cold and nasty.” 
No. 16 UF finished 11 shots behind win-
ner UCF with a score of 17-over (593) — a far departure from when the Gators won the tournament by nine strokes in 2013.
Mitchell shot rounds of 75 and 74 during 
Monday’s tournament, tying for 14th place 
with FIU’s Meghan MacLaren and Miami’s 
Rika Park. The rest of the Florida team placed among the top 30 players.“I feel like I played well, I hit the ball good, 
but my scores didn’t show that,” Mitchell 
said. “I burned the edges all day, coming re-
ally close but still missing.”
Mitchell gave coach Emily Glaser credit 
for encouraging the team to finish strong in the second round of the tournament.
“She kept pretty even throughout the 
day, when we were down she pumped us up and helped motivate us to finish strong and make some birdies,” Mitchell said. “Be-fore it started, she told us to stay patient, the patient ones play the smartest, and to trust 
ourselves.”
The team will begin qualifying rounds 
later this week to determine which players 
will attend the Northrop Grumman Regional 
Challenge in Palos Verdes. The Gators fin-
ished in fifth place out of 16 teams last year, earning a score of 40-over (892) on a course Glaser described as “unforgiving.”
Mitchell said the team plans to do a lot 
of putting in practice to prepare for the hilly greens in California. 
“It’s always difficult when you have to 
travel such a long way, get acclimated to the 
time change, get used to the grass,” Mitchell 
said. 
“It’s easier to go from Florida, Bermuda 
grass to other grass, so we kind of have the 
high end there.”Golfer disappointed after openerKeegan won two matches

we played.”

Percy Harvin is ready to start 
making an impact again.
After sitting out Seattle’s 23-17 
NFC Championship win against 
the San Francisco 49ers with a con-cussion, the ﬁ  fth-year wide receiver was cleared on Thursday to play in Super Bowl XLVIII against the Den-ver Broncos on Sunday at 6:25 p.m..
But Harvin is not complacent 
with just being on the Seahawks’ ac-tive roster in MetLife Stadium 
“I deﬁ  nitely think I can be a 
factor in this game,” Harvin said during Super Bowl Media Day on Tuesday. “The concussion was an unfortunate situation that I wish hadn’t happened, but I’m ready to play football.”
An injury-riddled season limited 
Harvin’s contributions during the Seahawks’ quest for the Lombardi Trophy this season. Harvin, who had hip surgery on Aug. 1, 2013, played in only one regular-season game.
In that lone game, against the 
Minnesota Vikings on Nov. 17, 2013, Harvin returned a late second-quarter kickoff 58 yards to the Min-nesota 46-yard line. 
The Seahawks scored a touch-
down ﬁ  ve plays later to extend their lead to 24-13 entering halftime. Har-vin also recorded one catch for 17 yards in Seattle’s 41-20 win.
Harvin returned to action during 
the Divisional Round of the play-offs, recording three catches for 21 yards in the ﬁ  rst half of Seattle’s 23-
15 victory against the New Orleans 
Saints on Jan. 11 before suffering the concussion.
Harvin’s presence on the ﬁ  eld 
will be a boost for a Seahawks of-fense that ended the regular season 26th in passing offense, averaging a meager 202.3 yards per game. 
The 5-foot-11, 184-pound Harvin 
gives Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson a deep-threat in addition to starters Golden Tate and Doug Baldwin, who combined for 44.4 percent of Wilson’s completed pass-es during the regular season.
Before becoming a victim of the 
injury bug and missing 22 regular season games since Nov. 11, 2012, 
Harvin proved to be a valuable as-
set on offense.
The 22nd overall draft pick by 
Minnesota in 2009, Harvin recorded 3,212 yards of offense for the Vi-kings and 20 touchdowns during his ﬁ  rst three seasons in the NFL. He also added four touchdowns on kick returns while averaging 26.6 yards per return in 45 games.
Harvin continued his success to 
start the 2012 season, leading the Vikings in receiving yards during seven of the team’s ﬁ  rst eight con-tests, six of which saw Harvin gain at least 84 yards.

season. 
In his six years in the NFL — 
four with the Cincinnati Bengals and two with Denver — Caldwell has recorded 141 catches for 1,390 yards and nine touchdowns in 75 games.
In 2013, Mincey played in 10 
regular season games — eight with Jacksonville and two with Denver — and recorded 17 tackles and two sacks.
