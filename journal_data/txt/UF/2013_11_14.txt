Playing It Cool
Jeff Allen and his dog, Duke, enjoy the drop in temperature by playing fetch at Squirrel Ridge Park on Wednesday 
afternoon. The weather in Gainesville reached a low of 45 degrees.

The cold weather blew in and took UF 
students by surprise Wednesday when the 
weather dropped to the 40s. But the cold snap is temporary.
WRUF chief meteorologist Jeff Huffman 
wrote in an email that Wednesday night was the coldest night of the fall season so far.
He said a freeze is not expected in 
Gainesville, and the next cold front is expected to set in Monday or Tuesday of next week.
Meanwhile, Huffman recommended 
Wednesday that students bundle up. Many 
found they were unprepared.
“I wish I had shoes for it,” said Rebekah Plazewski, a 20-year-old UF telecommunica-
tion junior wearing ﬂ  ip-ﬂ  ops.
December Slater, a 20-year-old UF explor-atory sophomore, joked about the weather.
“I think it’s hysterical two or three days ago 
we were at 90,” she said.
Travis Swanson, an 18-year-old UF applied 
physiology and kinesiology freshman, com-plained the temperatures were short-lived.
“I want it to stay, but it’s Florida weather, 
so it won’t,” he said.Fickle Florida weather leaves students chilled — for now
� IT’S PART OF DIABETES 
AWARENESS MONTH.
MARIA LLORENS

The UF Student Health Care Center is of-
fering free blood glucose tests as part of UF’s 
Diabetes Awareness Month.
With the American Diabetes Association 
estimating there are about 7 million people 
with undiagnosed diabetes, the tests could 
serve as a ﬁ  rst step for those who may have the disease.
Free blood glucose tests will be given to-
day from 9 a.m. until noon. They will be giv-en again at 5:30 p.m. at Century Tower. The tests measure high blood sugar levels, which are among the early signs of diabetes.
Any student with a high-calorie diet and 
a sedentary lifestyle should consider get-ting the test and changing his or her habits, said Kathryn Parker, the program manager for diabetes education at UF Health Shands Hospital.
“You’ve got to eat less and move more,” 
she said.
Students who stop by will get a ﬁ  nger-stick 
blood test. Results will be given immediately, 
said Catherine Seemann, the marketing coor-
dinator for the SHCC. About 50 students did the test last year, but this time, they would like to see more get tested, she said. 
The test does not determine whether a 
student has diabetes. Students with high blood sugar levels will be referred to a doctor for further testing, Parker said. Most students won’t ﬁ  nd out until about 10 to 15 years after 
they get the disease.
“They have a stroke or heart attack, and 
they ﬁ  nd out they have diabetes,” Parker 
said.Free blood

The man walked about eight miles to 
the doors of Lazarus Restoration Ministries 
Inc. with hopes of getting a new blanket to help him through the winter.
The local ministry has been short on 
winter supply this year, and the colder it gets, the more people are coming, said Wanda Nelson, who is in charge of collect-ing coats.
“We gave him food and a bathrobe,” 
she said. “But he got here, and there just weren’t any blankets left.”
Every Monday through the end of De-
cember, Nelson said, the ministry will be collecting clean winterwear and blankets from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at 3019 NE 20th Way.
During that time, those looking for food 
or clothing are invited to peek through the pantries and closets at the ministry to take what they need, Nelson said.
She said the agency needs more large 
coats and jackets. Blankets usually go with-
in the ﬁ  rst hour.
“We come and do our work,” she said. 
“But we can’t do much if there’s nothing to 
give.”
The ministry has helped about 100 peo-
ple in the last three weeks.Organizations collect winter wear for homeless

Students from Dance Marathon set up a jail on Turlington Plaza on Wednesday afternoon. Members 
had a “bail” set, and pedestrians could pay for their release. In return, the dancers would perform. All proceeds were donated to Dance Marathon and Children’s Miracle Network.

Students passing through Turl-
ington Plaza on Wednesday might 
have been alarmed to see begging  students inside a giant cage, but don’t worry — it was for the kids.
Jamie Heekin, a 21-year-old UF 
food sciences and human nutri-tion senior and overall director for Dance Marathon, said the stunt was a “jailbreak” fundraising event, the ﬁ  rst of its kind held on Turlington. Normally, she said, the event takes place outside the Ste-phen C. O’Connell center during Dance Marathon.
The plastic prison was stuffed 
with both Dance Marathon afﬁ  li-
ated students who signed up for 
shifts and random students who just wanted to help, Heekin said.
“Some people just came up and 
said, ‘What are you guys doing? Can I hop in jail?’” she said.
Students inside the 10-foot-tall cage set their own “bail” and had to beg passers-by for money in order to be released, Heekin said. Bail was set anywhere from $5 to $100, and proceeds went to indi-vidual Dance Marathon pages.
Seth Fisher, an 18-year-old UF 
accounting freshman, handed over $2, much to the delight of a cheer-ing inmate.
“I know what it’s like to raise 
money,” he said, “so I just wanted to reach out and help somebody.”

As an investigation con-
tinues into the cause of a so-
lar panel ﬁ  re that closed Best Buy for about two hours last week, local businesses with 
solar panel systems are em-
phasizing that solar is safe.
Barry Jacobson, the presi-
dent of Solar Impact, said the company has installed about two-thirds of the solar panel systems in Gainesville, and it would be unusual if the pan-els caused the ﬁ  re.
“It takes a very special sit-
uation for solar to be related to a ﬁ  re,” he said.
Although Jacobson said 
it is not impossible for solar panels to cause a ﬁ  re, he does not want the public to view solar panel systems as un-safe.
“I don’t want people to 
look at that and say, ‘Oh, so-lar is dangerous,’” Jacobson said. “In the case of Best Buy, we still don’t know if that was the case.”
AMJ Inc. of Gainesville, 
located at 502 NW 16th Ave., 
has had a solar panel system on its ofﬁ  ce building since the end of last year.
“If we do discover that the panels were a source, we’d like to know why so that we can make sure that doesn’t happen to us,” said Scott Buchanan, who is part of the management team.
Small World Daycare & 
Learning Center, 1214 NW 
Fourth St., has had solar pan-els in its facility since 2011.
Russell Scoates, the owner, 
said one of the reasons he de-cided to install the system was to use it as a teaching tool.
“I thought it would be 
educational for the children,” Scoates said. “We have a TV monitor installed by Solar 
Impact that shows how much 
electricity is being gener-ated.”
He said he is not worried 
about his system being dan-gerous and has never had any issues with it.
“Being a child care center 
with kids in here, we’re very 
over the top with protection 
on the kids,” Scoates said. “I’ve got no concerns.”Solar businesses

An early start to Black Friday could affect lo-
cals’  Thanksgiving traditions this year.
Walmart announced Tuesday the chain will be-
gin Black Friday specials at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiv-
ing at all locations, according to a news release. 
The chain follows a trend in retail as more stores 
opt to offer deals earlier on Thanksgiving Day.
Taylor Chambers, a 21-year-old UF health edu-
cation and behavior senior, agreed that the longer Black Friday period cuts into traditions.
“It takes away from the spirit and celebration 
that Thanksgiving is,” he said.
This change risks taking loved ones away from 
their families to work new hours, Chambers said.
Devin McDaniel, a 20-year-old UF marketing 
junior, is an avid Black Friday shopper, but the earlier start doesn’t excite her.
“I was upset because my family usually has 
dinner around 5:30,” McDaniel said, “so this cuts into my family time.”
She said the start time could shape a more ma-
terialistic society.
Khadijah Warnke, an employee at the Oaks 
Mall, said staff was told her store may open sometime Thanksgiving evening, “which stinks because people are still eating with their family and enjoying meals,” she said.
“I don’t understand what the big deal is,” she 
said. “People already have 24 hours to go shop-
ping.”Black Friday sales

Fewer agencies are running winter drives
She said there might be a higher de-
mand now than in past years because 
there are fewer agencies able to run win-ter drives this year.
Nelson’s niece, Natasha James, ac-
companied her to volunteer at the drive for the ﬁ  rst time Monday, and she’ll be back to help downtown today.
Today marks the 15th Annual Ala-
chua County Coalition for the Homeless and Hungry’s Breakfast on the Plaza.
Lazarus Restoration Ministries is 
one of many agencies that will be on Bo Diddley Community Plaza from 9 a.m. to noon to help feed and clothe the homeless, and it will bring the coat drive downtown for the day.
“I can understand what they’re going 
through, you know. Been there, done that,” James said. “I really liked helping 
out.”
Lazarus Restoration Ministries is one of 26 agencies in the Alachua County Coalition for the Homeless and Hungry, 
according to the coalition’s website.
According to the Alachua County 
Homeless Census conducted on Jan. 24, the county’s homeless count rose from 1,781 to 2,094 last year.
Nelson said she thinks the count ap-
pears to be growing again this year.
“It brings me shame to know that so 
many people are in need,” Nelson said. “But that’s just real life.” COATS , from page 1

WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THE CHANGE.

Outdoor seating may go main-
stream for Main Street venues.
The Gainesville Community 
Development Committee ap-
proved a plan Wednesday to al-
low more sidewalk cafe space 
along state-maintained roads, including Main Street, but at a cost.
The Department of Transpor-
tation no longer allows free use of state-owned sidewalk space. 
Changes in state policy now 
require an annual lease of $2 per 
square foot and general liability 
insurance of at least $2 million. 
Now, the city must enter into a 
lease agreement with the state to 
offer outdoor dining space.
The request for an agreement 
with the Florida Department of Transportation will pass to the City Commission, Commissioner Thomas Hawkins said.Hawkins said he supports the 
proposal and believes more out-door space would be beneficial to both downtown businesses and visitors.
There are currently seven side-walk cafes that would be affected by the change, including The Top and Sweet Mel’s, plus two other businesses looking to expand on North Main Street.
Scott Shillington, co-owner of 
The Top, said the committee’s support is a step in the right di-rection because under the status quo, no new sidewalk cafe space is allowed.
He and his business partner 
also own The Wooly and Pop A Top Corner Store and hope to add sidewalk seating to both lo-cations.
The most recent Gainesville 
restaurant to add patio seating on state-owned sidewalk space was How Do You Roll?, a sushi restaurant on the ground floor of the Stadium Club building on University Avenue.
Shillington said he’s seen re-
cent growth in the amount of people living and working down-town. 
He said he thinks outdoor 
seating will offer more space and visual appeal.
“I’d like people to be able to 
enjoy sitting outdoors, sip some wine and maybe grab a bite to eat,” he said. “It will take some compromising.”THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5

A group of students wear-
ing red, blue, yellow and green 
shirts gathered on the North Lawn on Wednesday with nothing but headphones, MP3 
players and deflated balloons.
Students were told to down-
load a 40-minute MP3 file, syn-
chronize their watches and play the recording at exactly 2 p.m., at which point instruc-tions would be given to them, according to the event page.
Jaclyn Gutierrez, a 19-year-
old UF marketing sophomore and director of Reitz Union Board Entertainment’s Arts Committee, created a partner-ship with Improv Everywhere to host the flash mob.
“It’s just a joyful activity that 
you probably wouldn’t have the guts to do on your own. 
It would also be really creepy 
on your own,” Gutierrez said. “But when you do it with a group of people, it’s fun.”
Improv Everywhere, a New 
York City-based prank collec-tive, is currently touring these Mp3 Experiment events at international festivals and col-
lege campuses, according to 
the official website. UF is the first college campus in Florida 
to participate, Gutierrez said.
The recorded instructions, 
given by an omniscient voice 
named Steve, gave different commands from awkward handshakes with strangers to dancing like an animal to fol-lowing a random person, said 19-year-old Robert Taylor, a 
UF mathematics sophomore 
who participated.
“It’s good fun,” Taylor said. 
“You just have an excuse to fool around in public.”
As the group completed 
each new activity, passers-by would stop and stare.
Sarah Brinkerhoff, an 
18-year-old UF engineering freshman, came by the lawn to watch her friend participate in the flash mob.
“It was cool to see people’s 
reactions that didn’t know it was happening,” Brinkerhoff said.
The event ended with a bal-
loon fight with the red and yel-
low shirts teaming on one side, 
leaving blue and green on the other end of the field.
Participant Brittany Doyle, a 
19-year-old UF political science junior, felt the surprise was the best part of the event, though.
“I thought it was cool be-
cause we didn’t know what we 
were supposed to do,” Doyle 
said. “Not knowing what we were getting ourselves into (was the best part).”Flash mob keeps

A UF alumna has begun a road trip in hopes of meet-
ing the needs of strangers through random acts of kind-
ness.
Meaghan Jameson, 23, and her boyfriend, Dan Ken-
ny, 26, started their journey on Nov. 5 and will continue 
through January.
“Helping people is just how I was raised,” Jameson 
said. “I used to pay people’s parking tickets in my home-
town for fun.”
Jameson and Kenny created the Random Acts of 
Kindness Road Trip as a way to continue helping others in a creative way.
Funding started in August and will continue through-
out the trip. Donated funds will be used solely for the 
random acts. Money needed for lodging, food and gas 
will come from personal savings, Jameson said.
“At first, our $10,000 goal was just for kicks, but it’s 
becoming more and more realistic,” she said. Almost $5,000 has been raised so far.
The road trip started last week in Michigan and will 
continue through Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, Washington, Oregon, California, Texas and finally, Flor-ida, where the couple will spend Christmas with Jame-
son’s family.“It was definitely a wild card telling my parents that 
I was quitting my job and going on a road trip across the 
U.S.,” she said. “But they were supportive.”
Jameson said she thinks the trip has been successful 
so far, and Elizabeth Hart, a 26-year-old teacher in Chi-cago, agrees.
Hart teaches at an all-boys school in the low-income, 
crime-stricken neighborhood of Englewood.
“Meaghan contacted me and asked for a student who 
I thought might be able to benefit from her idea,” Hart said. “I knew just the student.”
Jameson came to Chicago with a bag of art supplies 
for an artistically talented freshman, Hart said. When he opened it, he just whispered, “Awesome,” and went right to drawing. Hart was also given $600, and $130 of it was used to pay for a student’s mother’s medication for the month, Hart said.
“Once I gave it to her and explained the RAK Road 
Trip idea, she just burst into tears,” Jameson said. “She told me that everyone needs affirmation that there are good people left in the world and that this was hers.”Alumna traveling for acts of kindness

A woman ran up to him, saying 
Linkins had threatened her with a 
knife and told her, “I’ll f**k you up 
and the police, too,” according to the report.
She also told the officer Linkins 
drove away in a green Ford Explor-er with no tags. About an hour and a half later, the officer spotted and stopped the Explorer in the park-ing lot of Home Depot, 5150 NW 
13th St.
During questioning, Linkins 
told police he did get in a fight with his wife, but he said he took out the 
knife to cut a fishing line, according to the report.
Officers handcuffed him and 
put him inside the squad car, but 
Linkins refused to put his legs in. 
Police then tried to secure 
Linkin’s legs, and he kicked one of-
ficer in the chest, according to the report. 
He later slipped his handcuffs 
from behind him and removed leg restraints twice.
Police booked Linkins into the 
Alachua County Jail at about 2:30 p.m., where he remained Wednes-day night in lieu of a $66,000 bond.Man arrested after threatening wife“I only had the idea of the road trip for

New ranking should 
make humanities 
majors uneasy
As a wise poet once said, “Cash rules everything 
around me/C.R.E.A.M. get the money/dolla dolla bill y’aaaaaall.”
The men of Wu-Tang Clan aren’t alone. A recent Times 
Higher Education ranking revealed that cash rules everything 
around Gators, too: UF was ranked 49 out of the top 100 uni-
versities that produce the most millionaires worldwide. In addition to being the only Florida school to make the list, UF beat out the University of Notre Dame, Rutgers University and Brown University.
It’s no surprise UF ranked higher than some smaller liberal 
arts colleges. The Times Higher Education’s research found that engineering degrees produce the most millionaires, fol-lowed by MBAs, law degrees, accounting degrees and ﬁ  nan-
cial degrees. This is to be expected. It’s no secret that degrees 
in science, technology, engineering and mathematics — STEM ﬁ  elds — almost always translate into high-paying careers. The demand is consistent: Obviously, we’ll always need engineers to build our roads, cars and spaceships. We need doctors, IT professionals, lawyers, business owners, ﬁ  nancial advisers and scientists. The ROI, or return on investment, of a STEM degree is much higher compared to one in, say, journalism.  
Although UF’s high ranking on the list is good news for en-
gineers — and lawyers and scientists and technology wizards and business owners — it might stir up old debates on a state level when the time comes for Rick Scott to make decisions about higher-education funding. Remember in 2011 when he said he wanted to shift more money into STEM departments and away from liberal arts disciplines?
“Is it a vital interest of the state to have more anthropolo-
gists? I don’t think so,” Scott said, according to Hufﬁ  ngton Post Politics. “If I’m going to take money from a citizen to put into 
education then I’m going to take that money to create jobs. So 
I want that money to go to degrees where people can get jobs in this state.”
The statement seemed to be a shot at his daughter, who 
holds an undergraduate degree in anthropology from the Col-lege of William & Mary.
It’s an age-old argument: The value of a STEM degree ver-
sus the value of a humanities degree — or a communications degree, for that matter. We can discuss at length how STEM 
majors and humanities majors have a symbiotic relationship, 
but the crux of the argument is in how the value of each degree is measured. Engineers obviously make a lot of money, law-yers make a lot of money, doctors make a lot of money, and in-vestment bankers earn high salaries. Teachers, reporters, social workers and HR professionals earn low salaries. 
We all know money is the most common and accessible 
measure of success, and this new Times ranking provides poli-ticians like Rick Scott more ammunition toward pulling fund-ing from humanities in favor of science and math.Prez candidates should appear in Sunshine
Amid the revelations that the government watches nearly everything we do, it may come as a surprise that states have actual laws ensuring government 
transparency.
Called the Sunshine Law in Florida, this legislation 
helps shine a light on the doings of our government. After the NSA revelations, it comes as no surprise that some leg-islators are trying to roll back this law.
In Florida, there is one such attempt coming from 
Democratic Rep. Dave Kerner of Palm Beach County. His proposed law would keep potential university presidents’ names private.
Basically, if a school is looking to hire a new executive, 
applicants would be shaded from the Sunshine Law until 
at least 21 days before ofﬁ  cials make a ﬁ  nal decision.
Kerner cited a paper from the University of Houston 
Law Center that states the publicity surrounding the se-
lection process of university presidents discourages some from applying. Without the Sunshine Law, he argues, more well-qualiﬁ  ed applicants will seek the position, and schools will have stronger candidates to choose from as a result.
The Sunshine Law hasn’t stopped well-qualiﬁ  ed ap-
plicants in the past, however. Eric Barron was chosen as president of Florida State University in 2010, and his impressive credentials include previous positions as the dean of the Jackson School of Geosciences at the Univer-sity of Texas at Austin and director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., according to the FSU website.
With one paper based on two schools as evidence, 
Kerner seeks to hide nearly the entire presidential-seeking 
process. Granted, there is still the 21-day window for in-
terested parties to get to know the candidates, but that is not enough time for adequate information to be obtained, not to mention, the process would be almost over at that point.
The government answers to the people, not the other 
way around. Kerner’s bill would skirt the public’s ability to evaluate the candidates who may potentially govern a university.
In the American democratic 
process, we don’t hide candidates for ofﬁ  ce until three weeks before election time. Of course, the elec-
tion of a university’s president 
is not the same as electing a rep-resentative or the president, but that is no excuse to hide these candidates from Floridians.
University presidents make important decisions that 
involve students, communities and the scarce dollars they get paid with.
“I’ll never doubt the ability of UF and other universi-
ties to attract top candidates, and I’m not suggesting we don’t have the ability to attract great candidates,” Kerner told The Gainesville Sun.
If you don’t doubt it, then why hide them?Secrecy encourages corruption, not good practice. The 
only thing this law would do is make the presidential se-lection process less transparent and give the community less say in who is ultimately chosen.
So who will this law beneﬁ  t? As it seems with most 
new government policies, it will only beneﬁ  t the corrupt with connections. After all, those who would be discour-aged by transparency in the presidential selection process probably have something to hide in the ﬁ  rst place.
It’s important that government agencies be held ac-
countable to the people they work for. That’s how a de-mocracy works. Education, though not inherently demo-cratic, stands as the institution it is today because of the democratic process in America.
It is unfair to the community, the faculty and the stu-
dents to hide who their next chief administrator will be. It discredits their ability to evaluate and comment on their future president.
We’ve got enough secrets. Let’s not start keeping any 
more.

Last week, Minneapolis-based band 
Motion City Soundtrack — whose songs 
you set to autoplay on your MySpace 
pages, whose lyrics you scrawled on 
your arms during that boring ninth-grade history class and whose very name stirs up memories of checkerboard Vans and 
middle school dances — played at High 
Dive with Relient K and Driver Friendly.
The group gave a 
high-energy performance punctuated with thrashing 
guitars, moshing guys in 
fedoras, heavy distortion and random crowd surfers. 
High school kids with 
Sharpie X’s on their hands and parents in tow took selﬁ  es and screamed. 
Muscle-bound boys in frat tanks, punks 
with blue mohawks, and girls in plaid 
men’s shirts and beanies gathered under 
one roof to see Motion City Soundtrack, which released its ﬁ  fth studio album, “Go,” last year and a new single, “Inside 
Out,” in September.
“‘Go’ was … our most beautiful, our 
most textured, mature album we’ve done,” drummer Claudio Rivera said in an 
interview.  “Where do you go from there? Let’s bring it back. Let’s strip it back down and make it rock ‘n’ roll.”
“We’ve always had the pop sense, the 
dark, adult, like, in-Justin’s-head lyrics,” keyboardist Jesse Johnson said, “and we’ve also had aggressive Jawbox, Fugazi guitars. We’ve always battled on how 
everything melts together.”
Where the tracks on “Go” were polished, 
“Inside Out” is rough around the edges. 
“Go” was edged with a little more pop than the group’s previous albums, especially on 
tracks such as “True Romance” — a love 
song — and the beginning track, “Circuits and Wires.” “Inside Out” is a return to punk 
— angrier, more frantic and more aggressive. 
All in all, it’s the type of music that 
sounds good through headphones and car stereos but sounds even better live in a small black-box venue like High Dive.
Although the band is returning to an earlier punk sound and playing rock shows, the men have matured both musically and personally.
“I mean, everyone’s married except 
me,” Rivera said. “We’re in our early- and mid-30s ... It kind of happens automatically with time. I shudder to think about a 35- or 40-year-old that’s still, like, boozing it up at a dive bar and getting crazy. It’s something that happens as you grow up. Your tastes reﬁ  ne.”
“And it’s just being in a band — putting 
out albums for 12 years,” Johnson said.  “If we put out the same album six times in a row, it’d probably be pretty boring.”

With an upcoming album, a 
full headlining tour with reggae 
group Ballyhoo! and a new re-
cord deal, it’s possible Passaﬁ  re 
is having its most successful year yet.
The group, which released its 
ﬁ  fth album, “Vines,” on Monday, recently concluded the 2013 Bre-wHaha Tour with Ballyhoo! in support of the project.
Will Kubley, who plays bass 
and sings backup vocals, said Gainesville is one of the stops the 
band always makes sure to play 
while in Florida because of the support they’ve received from lo-cal fans over the years.
The band formed in 2003 af-
ter lead singer and guitarist Ted Bowne met Will Kubley and his brother, Nick Kubley, at the Sa-vannah College of Art and De-sign. The Savan-nah, Ga., group released its self-titled album 
that year and 
has been visiting Gainesville ever since.
After releasing its ﬁ  rst three 
albums, Passaﬁ  re found main-stream success when they re-leased the album “Start from Scratch” in 2011, which reached No. 6 on the Billboard Top Reg-gae Albums chart.
On top of the success the band 
has found through record sales, 
it has toured with artists such as 
Pepper, Matisyahu and 311.
“Vines” was made after about 
a year of planning, writing and 
recording, said drummer Nick 
Kubley.  He said Passaﬁ  re took a two- to three- month break be-tween touring last year to record some of the songs on the 13-track effort. The band stopped in El Paso, Texas, to record some of the material that was created while traveling.
Over the summer tour, the 
band started inviting fans to lis-ten to some of the new material and acoustic songs backstage be-
fore the show. Nick Kubley said 
they started with just acoustic songs to get the fans involved but decided to start playing the new

ing at a normal pace of two to three miles per hour can burn 300 calories or more, according to Everyday Health.
Beef has a high saturated fat content, which is OK in moderation but not good for your heart or waistline when consumed on a regular basis. Try to limit con-
sumption to once a week. Also, when choosing your meat, go for grass-fed cattle over corn-fed. Not only is it more environment-friendly because fertilizers and pesticides are not used in the feeding process, but also “researchers estimate that with proper management, ranchers and farmers can achieve a 2% increase in soil-carbon levels on existing agricultural, grazing, and desert lands over the next two decades,” according to CC Health Counseling.Food at farmers markets is generally grown using less pesticides than conventional agriculture and use methods 
that minimize the impact on the earth. Plus, walking through the outdoor market will burn some extra calories.
Nothing can substitute the beneﬁ  ts of drinking water. I carry around a gallon jug, despite looking a bit 
ridiculous, to ensure I drink enough. Water keeps the skin young and hydrated, helps with losing weight,  protects the joints, increases cognitive functions and builds muscle. Not to mention, your body and cells need it to survive.The trans fat, preservatives, chemicals and GMOs used in the making of fast food are foreign and unrec-ognized by the body. Not only does this provide zero nutritional beneﬁ  t, but they also store as fat or goes directly through you to the toilet. If disease prevention and overall better health isn’t enough, you will surely lose weight by eliminating fast food from your diet and avoiding processed foods whenever possible.THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

Dear Mediocre Advice,
I have been having an argument with my roommate for a few 
weeks. He eats the food in the fridge that is mine and then replaces 
it with a cheaper variety or not at all. I’m literally ready to take a dump on his bed because his terrible replacements get me sick. I’ve already asked and then told him to stop. I want to cross the line of “civility” to make my point. Do you have any suggestions? Yes, I am 
OK with crapping in his pillowcase.Dear Friend,
Your roommate sounds like a dog that knows how to open the refrigerator 
or a dumpster animal. If you just want revenge, buy whatever food you think he’ll eat, which is probably anything, and put laxatives in it. It’s not 
your fault that your roommate is a big, fat see-you-next-Tuesday. If your 
lease is not even close to being up, you should eat out more — and not in the good way I wish I was talking about. Start looking for a new roommate. There is nothing worse than coming home to someone you can’t stand and an empty freezer where there was once a frozen pizza.                                                1. “Holding On for Life” — Broken Bells

Juicy J performs at the Florida Theater on University Avenue on Sunday night. The rap artist performed songs 
from his most recent album, “Stay Trippy,” as well as old classics.
album before it came out.
He said those experiences have led the 
band to want to release a full acoustic album 
to give back to the fans who have supported 
the band.
The new album may have taken longer to 
release without help from some of those fans. 
In April, the band had more than $8,000 
of equipment stolen from its tour van. Fans pitched in through Passaﬁ  re’s Facebook page to help raise some of the money and assure the group had instruments in time to continue 
touring.
“We would have had to just round up stuff 
and borrow stuff,” Nick Kubley said. “The fact 
that we were able to get enough money to get 
it back in less than a week was amazing. So the 
fans came through in a huge way, and we’ll be forever grateful.”
Despite all the achievements Passaﬁ  re has 
had so far, it recently switched record labels 
from LAW Records to New York City’s Easy 
Star Records. Part of the reason the band tran-sitioned to the new label was the band mem-bers felt they had not received enough atten-
tion from labels before. The band put “Start 
from Scratch” out on its own, but Will Kubley said Easy Star put more effort into the guys’ album than they had seen before.
“It’s been awesome having an outside 
group of people that believe in music as much as you do and that are super supportive, Will Kubley said.The band is 
grateful for 
fans’ support

Avenue Writer jwerley@alligator.org
Indie rockers came out in droves 
for Florida’s ﬁ  rst Coastline Festival 
— featuring bands like Matt & Kim, Two Door Cinema Club and Passion Pit.
The festival was a two-day affair, 
with bands playing from about noon to 11 p.m. in Tampa on Saturday and performing in West Palm Beach on Sunday. The event featured food and drinks from local food trucks and craft breweries in the area.
Held at the MidFlorida Credit 
Union Amphitheatre, Tampa’s 
event was largely outdoors, with 
the smaller stage for newer acts held outside near the food trucks and the larger, main stage inside the open amphitheater, where the headliners played.
Despite some speed bumps due 
to the festival being held for the ﬁ  rst time, many people reacted positive-ly. 
“So far, it’s a good vibe,” said 
Tambari Piawah, a 19-year-old UF biology sophomore.
People also agreed that walking 
between the two stages provided a unique experience.
Michael Dang, a 19-year-old 
University of South Florida premed sophomore from St. Petersburg, said the festival atmosphere was bet-
ter than if the show had just been a 
regular concert.
“There is more stuff to do,” 
he said. “I plan to walk back and forth.”
Still, there were some setbacks to the concert. People complained about not having enough food trucks for the crowd and the trucks running out of food.
One of the largest complaints 
was that beer couldn’t be brought 
out to the food truck area and could 
only stay inside a special fenced-in area away from the concert stages and eating zone. This resulted in people not being able to watch the outside bands, eat food and drink at the same time. Signs posted said the separation of the outdoor concert area from the beer tent was because 
of liquor license issues.
“I like it, but I don’t understand 
why we can’t drink out there,” said 
Lauren Eddy, a 24-year-old from Tampa who works in real estate. “I would like to eat and drink togeth-er.”
Another complaint was from the 
local artists and vendors there to sell their work. The vendors were on the opposite side of the main stage, away from the food and drink ven-
dors.
Rachel Finn, co-owner of Ma-
deira Beach store When I Grow Up, 
which sells tie-dye clothing, said she paid $65 to have a spot at the festi-val, but she felt like it wasn’t quite worth it because she didn’t get as much trafﬁ  c. Still, she said she had a good time.
“I never have expectations. Then, 
I can never be disappointed,” she 
said.
Overall, for the ﬁ  rst year, the fes-
tival got positive reviews, especially 
with the impressive lineup and dy-namic bands like Matt & Kim.

Mike Davis felt burned by Flor-
ida. 
Now, the South Carolina run-
ning back can stick it to the school 
he feels betrayed him two years ago.
The former Florida commit-
ment was one of two running backs in the 2012 class. By Decem-ber 2011, coach Will Muschamp had hauled in the duo of Davis and Seffner native Matt Jones.
But Davis de-committed from 
UF after pledging his allegiance to the school nearly a year earlier 
at Florida’s junior day. Davis pub-
lished this cryptic tweet on Dec. 4, 
2011:
“It’s funny when you look a 
coach in the eye [and] see right 
through the B.S. [they] be [feed-
ing] you.”
He chose South Carolina over 
Georgia and Tennessee on Jan. 13, 
2012.
“Things happened; there was 
a misunderstanding with the Florida coaches,” Davis told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 
2011. 
“I can’t comment on what 
went wrong. It just wasn’t meant 
to be. Some things happened, and I don’t want to comment on what 
happened.”
It’s been two years since Davis 
spurned the Gators. One team is 
in contention for a Southeast-ern Conference Eastern Division 
crown. The other is fighting for  
bowl eligibility.
No. 11 South Carolina (7-2, 5-2 
SEC) hosts Florida (4-5, 3-4) on Saturday night in Columbia, S.C. 
Davis leads the SEC in rushing 
with 1,058 yards and 117.6 yards per game. He boasts an impres-sive 6.4 yards per carry and has 
10 touchdowns. The Gators have 
only allowed 16 offensive touch-downs as a team.
Davis was part of a quartet of 
Stephenson, Ga., high school play-
ers whom Florida coveted. Davis, 
defensive end Jarontay Jones, line-backer Raphael Kirby and defen-sive tackle Jafar Mann were billed 
as the “Stephenson Four.” 
Mann, a converted offensive 
lineman, was the only one to sign 
with the Gators. He was cited for marijuana possession two days 
before transferring from Florida.
Jones transferred from Virginia 
Tech to Bethune-Cookman, while 
Kirby became a reserve linebacker 
for Miami.
Davis felt hurt after Florida 
pursued future Georgia running 
back Keith Marshall, according to several reports. 
Whatever the reason for the 
switch, Florida isn’t wasting any time dwelling on it.
“It’s not really something you 
ever think about. It happens every year at every school,” UF defen-
sive coordinator D.J. Durkin said. 
“These guys bounce around, 
so it’s not really something you 
think about much afterwards. You 
know, you move on with the guys 
you got, and we’re happy with the guys we got. That’s who you have, so you coach them up and

Ziva Recek got off to a slow start against 
South Carolina on Wednesday night. 
The senior outside hitter opened the 
game with an attack error, which gave the 
Gamecocks their first point.  
But both Recek and UF bounced back. 
The Gators (23-2, 12-1 in Southeastern Con-ference) swept the Gamecocks in three sets 25-15, 25-9, 25-22.
“I’d like to that think the first two sets 
were more indicative of the progress we’ve made and taking advantage of a weekend of not playing,” coach Mary Wise said.
Consecutive service aces from Recek in 
the second set helped Florida grab a com-manding lead. 
Those were just two of 
Recek’s three service aces 
on the night. She also led 
the team with 15 kills. Re-cek contributed three of Florida’s 13 attack errors.
“I was just staying fo-
cused through the whole 
game,” Recek said. 
“I was not worrying about if I made some 
silly mistakes. I was just like keep playing, 
keep swinging high and hard.” 
The Gamecocks attempted to make a 
comeback in the third set. 
“The very first rally we won the point, but 
the effort level by South Carolina showed Florida sweeps South Carolina

ORLANDO — Abby Wambach con-
tinues to leave the rest of the world in 
the dust.
The United States Women’s National 
Team forward and former Gator scored 
her 163rd career goal in an international 
friendly match against Brazil at the Cit-rus Bowl in Orlando Sunday night.
Wambach shot a penalty kick to the 
back of the net in the 17th minute to help the U.S. notch a 4-1 victory in front of 20,274 fans. 
“We got the penalty a couple minutes 
after the first goal, and that’s demoraliz-ing from the opposite 
team’s perspective,” Wambach said. “I’ve been taking them all week since I missed against New Zealand. 
“I don’t miss very 
many in a row, so I’m very comfortable tak-ing penalty kicks. Get-
ting that goal was really important.”
The win for the U.S. against Brazil 
helped close out the team’s 2013 season with a 13-0-3 record — the first unde-feated season for the team since 2006, Wambach continues to shine

move forward.”
The team Florida brings to Williams-Brice 
Stadium will be very different than the squad it 
expected to have at this point. 
Jones is done for the season with a torn me-
niscus. Florida’s defense up the middle has been 
decimated by season-ending injuries to Domin-ique Easley and Antonio Morrison.
The Gamecocks’ blossoming talent will have 
the Gators at perhaps their lowest point in three seasons.  
Davis is ready. He posted another telling 
message on Monday after reminding his 19,000-plus followers that he was once a UF commit: 
“Never been so eager to play #hungry,” he 
tweeted.when the U.S. finished with an 
18-0-4 record.
Wambach has a storied his-
tory against Brazil. 
She scored a goal off a head-
er in overtime against Brazil to win the 2004 Olympic gold medal for the U.S.
In 2011, Wambach powered 
in another header in the final seconds of overtime of the 2011 FIFA Women’s World Cup quarterfinal to tie the game 2-2 and force the match into pen-alty kicks.
The U.S. won 5-3.“It’s always an emotional 
battle against the Brazilians,” Wambach said. 
“They’re so passionate and 
they’re so good at playing the game. 
“It makes you learn more 
about your team and how well you can do going forward when you play one of the top five teams in the world.”
Through her 12 years on the 
national team — most recently earning the 2012 FIFA Wom-en’s World Player of the Year honor — Wambach said she 
owed a lot of her focus in pro-
fessional soccer to her experi-ence at Florida from 1998-2001.
“Florida was one of those 
schools that literally tries to prepare those players to play at the next level,” Wambach said. “From the facilities to the travel, to the way that we’re fed on the road, everything is at the professional level. 
“That’s really where I start-
ed to learn how to be a profes-sional athlete. I didn’t know it at the time that I would make it to this level, but playing there really did allow me so many more opportunities post col-lege. I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for them.”
Wambach said the memory 
she cherishes most from Florida is being a part of the 1998 team, which won a national title.
“As a freshman, you can 
only dream to have a chance and to be able to come in and actually accomplish it,” Wam-bach said. “It was fairytale-like.” 
Wambach finished her 
freshman season with 19 goals — the then-second highest all-time goal total by a freshman.
Current freshman forward 
Savannah Jordan surpassed Wambach’s mark with 22,  which is one behind Andi Sell-ers’ all-time UF freshman re-cord of 23 goals in a season.
Jordan’s 2013 season total 
is the highest goal total UF has seen since Wambach turned in 
31 in her senior year.
“A player like Savannah 
probably comes around only 
once in however long it has been since I’ve been there,” Wambach said. “You really have to relish the opportunity with this player, who decided to come and play for this col-
lege. 
“She’s a kid who I think is 
going to up stand the value 
systems that Becky wants to put in place. I’m really excited to watch and see how Savan-nah’s career unfolds. Hope-fully, she can break and shatter every record I’ve ever set.”
Wambach’s memories of 
Florida are something she’ll always remember, but she has other goals now — most importantly winning another World Cup.
“We want to not only be a 
team that got so close in 2011, but we want to be a team where 
we can say, ‘We are world 
champions,’” Wambach said. “I’ve never done it. All but one player on this team right now doesn’t have the ability to say that. 
“It not only eats at us, 
but motivates us equally as much.” 16, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 14, 2013

victory against the Ospreys on Sunday in the O’Connell Center. Florida’s senior point guard scored 25 points on 8-of-16 shooting to help the Gators improve to 2-0 to start the season.
� UF AVERAGING 90.5 POINTS PER GAME.

Slowly but surely, the Gators’ competition stiffens 
as the season progresses. 
Florida faces its first major-conference opponent in 
Virginia Tech tonight at 7 in Blacksburg, Va.
The Gators have won back-to-back games to begin 
this season thanks to strong offensive showings, av-
eraging 90.5 points per game. Florida averaged 77.5 points in its first two contests of the 2012-13 cam-paign.
“Anybody on our team is subject to hit two or three 
(3-pointers) in a row,” coach Amanda Butler said. “Es-pecially when we have kids that are elite shooters like Carlie (Needles), like Lily (Svete). [Antoinette Bannis-ter] is in that category.”
The Gators showed off their offensive versatility 
in a 93-65 win against Bethune-Cookman on Nov. 8. Seven different players scored in double figures.
Senior Jaterra Bonds, who netted 10 points on 3-of-
13 shooting, contributed a game-high eight assists.
“That game, everybody was hot,” Bonds said. “I 
was trying to get the ball out of my hands and get it to the hot shooters.”
Two nights later, Bonds was the one scoring bas-
kets. She tallied a career-high 25 points along with nine assists in an 88-77 victory against North Florida.“Everybody’s going to have that night where 
they’re scoring,” Bonds said. “My teammates found me in the right spot and I just attacked it.”
Seemingly every Gator has had one of those nights 
through two games. No player is averaging fewer than 8.5 points per game through two contests.
“That’s one of the things that we think gives us a 
chance to be a special team,” Butler said of her team’s versatile roster of scorers. “A great shooter like Carlie goes only 1 for 5, but her teammate Lily goes 4 for 6.
“I think we have that ability across the board. 
Whoever is on, we’re going to look for them and get them the ball. Whoever is not is not going to hang their head and pout about that. They’re just going to get more assists by hitting the one who’s on.”
Florida has scored frequently in two games, but so 
have its opponents.
The Gators have surrendered 71 points per game 
in back-to-back contests against Bethune-Cookman and North Florida, which ranked 302nd and 325th na-tionally with 54 and 51.8 points per game last season, respectively.
Florida gave up only 57 points per game through 
its first two contests in 2012-13.
In the early going, the Gators are missing Jennifer 
George, who graduated. Last season, George became the first Florida player ever named to the All-South-eastern Conference Defensive Team.
“(George) was a great defender on the inside,” ju-
nior Kayla Lewis said.Gators preparing for road test tonight

UF labored in third set
me right away this one’s going 
to be much tougher,” Wise said. “South Carolina played so hard, and we made some unforced er-rors that gave them a chance to 
get that early lead.” 
Florida committed four of its 
eight service errors in the third 
set, along with eight of the team’s 13 attack errors. 
The errors helped the Game-
cocks lead more than they had all night. 
But their effort was short lived. 
The Gators took the lead at 21-20 
for the first time since scoring the 
first point of the set. 
A service ace from junior Tay-
lor Unroe won the game for Flor-ida. 
Wednesday’s match was just the first in a series of three hurdles the Gators will face this week. 
Florida will host Missouri on 
Friday night. The undefeated Ti-gers are currently sitting atop the SEC and are one of two teams that have beaten the Gators this sea-
son. 
“Friday night, it’s going to 
take the entire kitchen sink,” Wise 
said. “This Missouri team is as tal-ented a team that we’ve faced in the O’Connell Center in years.”VoLLey , from page 15
