SENATE TWICE BEFORE THEY CAN 
GO INTO EFFECT
By Meghan McGlone

Students are one step closer to receiving ad-
ditional funds for rent relief.
The UF Student Government Budget and Ap-
propriations Committee voted unanimously to 
pass a rent relief bill Friday. If passed twice more 
by the Senate, it will transfer $500,000 from the 
SG reserve account to eligible students. 
The Executive Committee, made up of the 
Student Body President, Vice President and Trea-
surer, ﬁ  rst approved the bill last week. Its next 
opportunity for passage will be on May 12, dur-
ing the ﬁ  rst Summer Senate meeting.
The bill aims to help off-campus students pay 
rent and any outstanding payments from March 
to May, co-author of the bill Student Body Presi-
dent Trevor Pope said. Not paying rent will nega-
tively affect students’ credit scores and future job 
applications, he said. If passed, it seeks to ensure 
that students don’t face those consequences.
 “As student government leaders, our stu-
dents’ future should be our top priority and really 
the most important thing on our mind, which is 
why we decided to create this bill,” he said.
Factors like the number of students in off-
campus housing and the average cost of rent 
were considered when deciding the amount of 
money SG should transfer, Pope said.
They also kept in mind the need to retain 
money in the SG reserve account, an account that 
collects leftover funds at the end of each year. If 
enrollment declines as a result of COVID-19, SG 
will make less money from fees for the Summer 
or Fall semesters, Pope said. 
As of March 11, SG has more than $4.3 mil-THE ORDER IS BEING CONSIDERED 
DISCRIMINATORY TOWARD PEOPLE WITH 
MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND DISABILITIES

Staff Writer 
A Gainesville attorney has threatened the county with a federal 
civil rights lawsuit in response to the controversial COVID-19 face 
mask emergency order.
On Wednesday, Attorney Raemi Eagle-Glenn sent a letter to Ala-chua County commissioners that threatened a lawsuit if the commis-
sioners didn’t rescind the COVID-19 face mask order by Friday. She 
said she hadn’t received a response from the county as of Sunday. 
The mask ordinance requires people to wear a face covering in ar-
eas where social distancing is not possible, like in retail stores. People 
with medical conditions or disabilities that make it difﬁ  cult to wear a 
mask, as well as those ages 6 and under, are exempt.
Eagle-Glenn’s letter says the county’s order discriminates against 
people who have medical conditions or disabilities by pressuring 
them to stay home. She said residents are being forced to explain 
their medical conditions to someone who isn’t their doctor before 
THE MOSQUITO’S ORIGINS 
ARE NOT KNOWN, BUT A CITY 
OFFICIAL SAID A LARVA WAS 
FOUND IN NOVEMBER

Staff Writer 
A yellow fever mosquito was discovered 
in Gainesville for the ﬁ  rst time since the early 
’90s.
In a Facebook post Tuesday, Gainesville’s Public Works Department wrote that a yel-
low fever mosquito was found downtown last 
week. Yellow fever mosquitoes can spread 
yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya and Zika 
viruses, according to the post.
Rossana Passaniti, a spokesperson for the 
City of Gainesville, told The Alligator she 
hadn’t heard of any recent sighting of a yel-
low fever mosquito. However, she said the 
mosquito’s larva was discovered in November 
and didn’t show signs of carrying diseases. Its 
origins are unknown.
While Public Works wrote that it is not aware of any active transmission of mosquito-
borne diseases, residents should take action 
by getting rid of potential breeding sites. 
The City of Gainesville’s website advises 
residents to drain standing water and any con-
tainers where sprinkler or rainwater collects 
to stop mosquitoes from breeding. Passanti 
said Gainesville Mosquito Control can supply 
residents with mosquito-eating ﬁ  sh for ponds.
The mosquitoes can be identiﬁ  ed by white 
markings on their legs and are found in areas 
where human-mosquito contact is frequent.
Peter Jiang, an entomologist with Gainesville Mosquito Control, declined to 
comment to The Alligator Wednesday. He 
said he couldn’t answer questions regarding 
the discovery of the mosquito, adding that its 
information line is intended for questions and 
concerns. 
Gainesville Mosquito Control’s informa-
tion line can be reached at 352-393-8287. 
Residents can also schedule inspections of po-
tential breeding sites at 352-393-8110.

On Mother’s Day, leaders seek 
some optimism amid pandemic 
Treasury Secretary Steven 
Mnuchin predicted on “Fox News 
Sunday” that the U.S. economy 
would rebound during the last 
half of the year. The unemploy-
ment rate has rivaled the Great 
Depression, with 3.2 million 
workers applying for unemploy-
ment benefits just last week. 
Over the last seven weeks, the 
total amount of Americans ap-
plying for unemployment has 
reached 33.5 million. Despite 
Mnuchin's claims, the director 
of the University of Washington 
institute that created a White 
House-endorsed COVID-19 mod-
el said moving to open the U.S. 
economy too soon could result in 
more cases and deaths in the next 
10 days. This week, three differ-
ent members of the White House 
Coronavirus Task Force, includ-
ing Dr. Anthony Fauci, placed 
themselves in self-quarantine af-
ter interacting with someone who 
tested positive for COVID-19. 
Internationally, countries are 
opening at different rates. U.K. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 
who was previously ill with 
COVID-19, encouraged people 
who can’t work from home to re-
turn to work this week. Johnson 
hopes to have schools and shops 
in the U.K. open by June 1. The 
U.K. suffered the most amount 
of virus-related deaths in Europe, 
with approximately 31,900 fatali-
ties. 
US virus patients and businesses 
sue China over outbreak 
A Wisconsin woman, along with 
dozens of other people, are su-
ing China for the COVID-19 out-
break. The virus has killed about 
75,000 in the U.S. Nine lawsuits 
have been filed suing China, with 
eight of them having the potential 
to be class action lawsuits, which 
would represent thousands of 
businesses and people. Experts 
say that the lawsuits face hurdles 
due to the Foreign Sovereign 
Immunities Act, which states that 
foreign governments cannot be 
sued in the U.S. unless certain ex-
ceptions are met. The attorneys 
who have filed the lawsuits said that they can prove their claims, 
and find a method of collect-
ing damages. Some of the ways 
they plan to collect damages is 
through seizing Chinese bank 
accounts or assets in the U.S. if 
China refuses to pay. The Chinese 
government has defended the 
country’s record of the virus, say-
ing that “open, transparent, and 
responsible manner,” and called 
the lawsuits “very absurd and 
has no factual and legal basis.” In 
Congress, there have been efforts 
in some states to make it easier to 
sue China. If the legislation were 
to pass, it would allow the U.S. to 
sue China for various things, not 
just the COVID-19 outbreak. 
Georgia officials examine threats 
to Arbery case prosecutors
Georgia officials are investigating 
an online threat to people pro-
testing the murder of Ahmaud 
Arbery, a black man who au-
thorities say died at the hands 
of two white men as he jogged 
through a neighborhood. The 
Georgia Bureau of Investigation 
said Sunday that it is aware of 
the Facebook threats and is con-
tinuing to investigate the situ-
ation. Arbery was shot on Feb. 
23, and last week a video of two 
men, Gregory McMichael and his 
son Travis McMichael, shooting 
Arbery came to the surface. The 
two men claimed they thought 
Arbery was a burglary suspect 
who they said had been recorded 
on a surveillance camera some 
time before. The pair was ar-
rested shortly after the video was 
released. 
 US Census stirs uncertainty for 
those displaced by virus
COVID-19 has unexpected dislo-
cation, making a typically easy 
question of “how many people 
are staying in your home?” con-
fusing for the newly displaced. 
People fleeing hotspots, being 
sent home from colleges and 
universities, and those who were 
hospitalized are now unsure 
what to put down as their home 
on the U.S. Census. The displace-
ment has resulted in low results 
from hot spot areas including the 
Upper East Side and Midtown, 
Manhattan where residents have 
left for the Hamptons, Florida and other places around the U.S. The 
Census Bureau said to fill out the 
survey at the location they usu-
ally reside if they plan to return 
back.  College students should fill 
out the survey at their university 
residence, since students are be-
ing counted in the census by their 
college or university. COVID-19 
has forced the census count from 
finishing at the end of July to the 
end of October. The bureau also 
asked Congress for permission to 
delay deadlines next year for giv-
ing census data to the states so 
they can draw new voting maps. 
The Census is responsible for de-
termining how many congressio-
nal seats each state gets. 
Pence, task force members isolate 
after virus exposure
A Trump administration official 
says that Vice President Mike 
Pence is in voluntary self-quar-
antine after being in contact with 
Katie Miller, Pence’s spokes-
woman. Along with Pence, three 
members of the White House 
Coronavirus Task Force have 
chosen to go into voluntary 
self-quarantine. Pence learned 
about Miller’s positive test on 
Friday morning before leaving 
Washington for a day-trip to 
Iowa. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the di-
rector of the National Institute of 
Allergy and Infectious Diseases 
and a leading member of the task 
force, was one of the members of 
the task force who has chosen to 
self-quarantine. Fauci’s institute 
said that he has tested negative 
twice for COVID-19, and is rela-
tively low-risk based on his level 
of exposure, but he is still choos-
ing to take “appropriate precau-
tions.” 
National parks visitors should 
plan for new normal 
The National Parks Service 
has started testing public ac-
cess at several locations around 
the nation after closing due to 
COVID-19 concerns. Park visitors 
should prepare themselves for a 
new normal when visiting the 
parks, said Acting Park Service 
Director David Vela. Parks are 
increasing their staffs and will be-
gin to increase access to parks as 
workers are hired to patrol trails 
and roads, host campgrounds 
and operate visitor centers and 
museums. The major parks that 
have been opened throughout 
the U.S. include Badlands and 
Wind Cave national parks and 
Jewel Cave National Monument 
in South Dakota, Everglades 
National Park in Florida, Indiana 
Dunes National Park, Lake Mead 
National Recreation Area in 
Nevada, Mount Rainier National 
Park in Washington, Mammoth 
Cave National Park in Kentucky 
and Pinnacles National Park in 
California.VOLUME 114 ISSUE 77

Alison Schwartz, an alumna of The Al-
ligator and UF, died April 28 after a three-
week battle with COVID-19 at a hospital  
outside New York City. She was 29.
Alison was the director of digital plat-
forms at People, where she began as an 
intern. She graduated from UF in 2012, 
where she was recognized as an outstand-
ing four-year scholar. At The Alligator, she 
started as a contributing writer and worked 
her way up to become the co-metro editor 
and Avenue editor.
She was an accomplished journalist, but 
Alison was more than her resume.
Alison cared deeply for people and cre-
ated strong bonds with her peers. Perhaps 
the strongest bond was with Jared Misner, 
her best friend. 
Alison and Misner met in Beaty Towers 
during their freshman year at UF in 2008. 
They were inseparable. Anyone who knew 
the duo could attest to that. They worked together at The Alligator, covering issues 
like the local mayoral race. They were co-
metro editors together. 
Even when they went their separate 
ways, the two were constantly thinking 
of each other. After graduation, Misner 
moved to Washington D.C. He was making 
about $400 a week before taxes, and his 
rent was $800 a month. Money was tight, 
and Alison knew that, Misner said. With-
out saying anything, Alison had Chinese 
food delivered to Misner’s door. 
“And that was just her,” Misner said. 
“She was always unfailingly kind, unfail-
ingly thoughtful.”
One of the best examples of this was 
the wedding present Alison got for Mis-
ner and his husband, Nate. On the day of 
their wedding, the present she bought for 
the newlyweds hadn’t arrived. It actually 
wouldn’t arrive until a year later. 
The woman on Etsy was just taking a 
long time to make it, Alison told him. 
The present, a 42-square-foot quilt, 
with all 1,420 words of Misner and his husband’s vows, was perfect, Misner said. 
Literally. The present was delayed because 
Alison had sent the custom-made quilt 
back twice to be remade because a comma 
was out of place or there was a misspelled 
word. Misner called her a “professional se-
cret santa.”
Alison was full of love. Full of love for 
people, full of love for the work she did 
and full of love for animals, especially 
rabbits. During college, she fostered rab-
bits from Gainesville Rabbit Rescue. That’s 
how her brother, Adam Schwartz, said he 
wants to remember her. Full of love and 
extremely generous. 
Schwartz said his sister had a lot to be 
proud of, but her biggest accomplishments 
were the relationships she built in her life.
“She was the most ﬁ  ercely loyal friend,” 
Schwartz said. “I think the people we sur-
round ourselves with tells who you are 
as a person. And hearing all these stories 
that people have shared about Alison—I 
have to think that more than her occupa-
tion, that’s the richest accomplishment you 
could have.”
Schwartz said he hopes people remem-
ber Alison as someone who lived life to her 
fullest. Someone who enjoyed every min-
ute, but knew that to play hard you had to 
work hard. As someone who knew what it meant to be there for loved ones. 
Schwartz said he hopes that people will 
remember Alison as an example of some-
one who followed her dreams and didn’t 
let anyone stop her.

entering a business.
Since the order took effect on May 4, Eagle-Glenn 
said she received dozens of calls and complaints. She 
is currently consulting 12 people who were affected 
by the order.
“I’ve received more calls in the past two days for 
my legal services than I have all year,” she said.
According to Eagle-Glenn, the order violates the 
due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, which 
requires the U.S. government to treat everyone fairly 
under the law, and the equal protection clause of the 
Fourteenth Amendment, which requires states to do 
the same. 
Together, they require that government entities 
in the U.S. not favor any citizen over another when 
passing or enforcing laws.
“Laws have to apply to all citizens equally,” Ea-
gle-Glenn said. “And this law is having an unequal 
and unfair effect on people who have conditions or 
people that are poor and cannot wear masks.”
The order has also led store employees to ques-
tion people without masks about their medical con-ditions, she said. To Eagle-Glenn, the order also vio-
lates the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Mark Sexton, spokesperson for Alachua County, 
said the county attorney’s ofﬁ  ce believes the ordi-
nance is legal.
“We obviously wouldn’t have put out an order 
that we didn’t think would stand legal muster,” he 
said.
County commissioners are following the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines 
about face masks, he said, adding that businesses 
aren’t supposed to ask for a doctor’s note or details 
about medical conditions. Sexton recommended 
people with medical conditions who are refused en-
try to a business contact the county. 
Eagle-Glenn said her next step is to draft a civil 
complaint, which initiates a lawsuit, and submit it on 
Monday or Tuesday.
“I don’t want to spend my weekend drafting a 
federal civil rights complaint,” she said. “But I have 
done it before, and I will have to do it again.”

If the bill is passed, Pope said the funds 
will be available to international and DACA 
students who cannot receive funding from 
the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic 
Security Act, a federal act awarding stu-
dents emergency ﬁ  nancial aid. 
This bill is important because it recog-
nizes students in different circumstances, Zachary Raad, Asian American Student 
Union’s co-president, said.
“We can’t just think of the voices that 
are already like the most present within that 
community,” the 20-year-old UF chemistry 
and Chinese senior said. “We also have to 
think of the ones that are too frequently left

Editor’s note: This 
article contains mentions 
of sexual assault 
and violence. Reader 
discretion is advised. 
Kelly asked to be referred 
to by the name “Lacey 
McTease” and with 
the pronouns she/her. 
However, after ﬁ  nding an 
email sent to professors 
in which Kelly says he 
uses the “transgender 
card” to get out of trouble 
and consulting several 
LGBTQ+ journalists, The 
Alligator decided to use 
his legal name. 
At ﬁ  rst, she thought she 
was helping someone with 
their anxiety.  
In a social media mes-
saging app called Discord, 
a user named YAK said on 
a UF-themed online server 
that he was having a panic 
attack, or a sudden feeling 
of intense fear. The UF stu-
dent quickly messaged him 
to ask if he was okay. 
A week later the user, 
whose real name is James 
Kelly, admitted that he was 
lying about the panic at-
tack—and his messages to 
her and other server mem-bers only got stranger over 
time, said the student, who 
asked to remain anony-
mous for fear of retaliation. 
“He was just saying 
weird things about being a 
prophet of God,” she said. 
“We didn’t know if he was 
serious or if he was joking.”
But then the online in-
teraction escalated when he 
threatened to rape her. 
He also introduced her 
online to a 14-year-old girl 
he said he was grooming, 
or preparing for his sexual 
advances. The UF student 
told The Alligator that she 
contacted UF’s Title IX of-
ﬁ  ce after that, but it went 
nowhere. 
The Title IX ofﬁ  ce, which 
is responsible for upholding 
the federal civil rights law 
that bans sex discrimina-
tion in schools—including 
threats of sexual assault—
declined to comment. 
“The police [weren’t] 
believing any of us. Noth-
ing was happening,” she 
said. “I felt scared to go 
downstairs in my apartment 
alone.”
That was early last sum-
mer, and the student is one 
of many whom Kelly has 
contacted over at least the 
past three years. But despite 
being banned from most UF 
properties since 2017, Kelly 
is still enrolled as a student at UF, university spokes-
person Steve Orlando con-
ﬁ  rmed.  
The Alligator obtained 
dozens of documents and 
court records dating back 
to 2005 that reﬂ  ect a pattern 
of physical violence, harass-
ment and threats from Kelly, 
who is a 36-year-old busi-
ness ﬁ  nance student living 
in Bowling Green, Florida, a 
small city about three hours 
south of Gainesville.
Among the documents 
is a report that details Kel-
ly’s warning to the univer-

Many furloughed workers 
and students in Gainesville are 
facing unexpected food scarcity 
and economic upheaval during 
the COVID-19 pandemic. Lo-
cal organizations are boosting 
their relief efforts to help keep 
the community fed.
 The Gainesville chapter of 
the Salvation Army and the 
Civic Media Center are among 
those on the frontline. The two 
have provided resources to 
those in need since before the 
pandemic began. With even 
greater need now than before, 
they are expanding their ser-
vices. 
 The CMC has offered its 
space to host a Free Grocery 
Store since Fall 2019. The ser-
vice attempts to connect those 
in need with one weeks’ worth 
of produce in order to combat 
food insecurity in Gainesville, 
said Renz Torres, co-coordina-
tor of the event.
 Food insecurity is the strug-
gle with physical or ﬁ  nancial 
obstacles that prevent people 
from maintaining access to 
food. This affects communities 
like low-income and home-
bound populations who may 
not be able to afford groceries 
or commute to acquire them, 
according to Feeding America.
 The CMC has begun to of-
fer delivery to assist those who 
are sheltering in place or self-
quarantining, Torres said. Food 
is sent out on Tuesdays from 3 
to 5 p.m.
 “We’ve had more of an 
impact on the community by 
doing this outreach and servic-
ing a need that isn’t offered by 
a lot of other pantry-style food 
distributions,” Torres said. 
“The homebound population is 
particularly harder to reach es-
pecially since people are on the 
other side of the digital divide.”  More people rely on the 
service now than before the 
pandemic began, Torres said. 
Due to high demand, the CMC 
has expanded its delivery ser-
vice to include Fridays, accord-
ing to the CMC’s Free Grocery 
Store Instagram. Households 
are limited to one delivery per 
week and must call to sched-
ule. 
 “We’ve gone from serving 
maybe 40 people a week prior 
to coronavirus to now serving 
300 to 350 people per week, all 
through delivery,” Torres said.
 The Salvation Army host-
ed a food drive Wednesday 
evening at its ofﬁ  ce at 639 E. 
University Ave. The event was 
held in the evening in order 
to serve people who couldn’t 
take time off of work during 
the morning or afternoon, said 
Priscilla Gonzalez, who helped 
distribute food. 
 The drive offered staple 
resources like rice, beans, 
corn, green beans, pasta, pasta 
sauce, paper towels and hair 
conditioners. By the end of the 
event, more than 117 people 
were served, according to 
Corps Ofﬁ  cer of Gainesville’s 
Salvation Army Maj. Hank 
Harwell. 
 The food drive protected 
its volunteers and recipients 
by ensuring that no physical 
contact took place. Recipients 
drove up to the ofﬁ  ce and 
opened their trunks, which Sal-
vation Army employees ﬁ  lled 
with bags of goods. 
 “We know that there are 
a lot of people who have lost 
hours at their workplace or 
have had to be laid off or fur-
loughed, yet the bills continue 
to come,” Harwell said. “By 
doing this, we hope to be able 
to help alleviate at least one 
stressor that the community is 
facing.”
 Apart from the services 
like the Salvation Army’s food drive and the CMC’s Free Gro-
cery Store, additional tools 
have been made available for 
the public to keep up with re-
lief efforts in their area.
 The members of the Face-
book group “Gainesville Free 
Food” update their page with 
information about locations 
and events that offer free food 
to the public whenever made 
aware of new local resources.
 The Florida Commissioner 
of Agriculture and Consumer 
Services, Nikki Fried, also ac-
tivated a statewide hotline in 
partnership with 2-1-1 to help 
parents ﬁ  nd free meals for their 
children who no longer have 
the option to attend school 
physically. For families facing 
ﬁ  nancial hardship and food in-
security, the hotline is intended 
to alleviate their burden.
 Florida residents can ﬁ  nd 
locations in their area offering 
free food for children by calling 
2-1-1 to speak to a live opera-
tor.
Anyone interested in donat-
ing to The Salvation Army of 
Gainesville or the CMC’s Free 
Grocery Store can call or reach 
out on their respective Face-
book pages. The CMC is also 
accepting dry food donations 
through a no-contact drop-off 
outside of the community cen-
ter, as written on its Facebook 
page. 
“We have not had a lot of 
nonperishable food donations 
to add to our food pantry, so 
we’ve had to actually go out 
and purchase some items to 
supplement what we have,” 
said Harwell. “We want to hold 
an event like this again, but we 
have to ask ourselves now if 
we can afford to do it.”

WILLIAMS CREATES A 
WORK ALL HER OWN 
ON HER NEW 
SOLO ALBUM
By River Wells
Staff Writer
If you listen, you’ll hear it.
On “Petals for Armor,” 
songs like “Over Yet” and “Pure 
Love” evoke the ’80s synth-
fueled shades of Paramore’s 
2017 album “After Laughter.” 
Other songs, like “Simmer” and 
“Leave It Alone,” harken back 
to Paramore’s days as an emo 
alt-rock force of nature with 
their dark ambiance and melo-
dies.
This isn’t Paramore, though. 
This is Hayley Williams, and 
the band’s longtime frontwom-
an does plenty to discern her 
own music and spirit from the 
band on her debut solo record.
Paramore members Taylor 
York and Zac Farro may still be 
on the record, but with its per-
sonal lyricism and wide array 
of inﬂ  uences, the record is de-
ﬁ  nitively Williams’ own state-
ment. Williams’ proclamation 
on “Watch Me While I Bloom” 
that “You’ve seen one side of me/now here’s something 
new” may be at the very end 
of the record, but the listener 
should be well aware of that if 
they’ve been listening up to that 
point. The range of songs like 
“Simmer” and a personal note 
from Williams before the start 
of “Dead Horse” showcase the 
piece of her soul she put into 
the music on this record, and it 
makes for a more than satisfy-
ing complete listening experi-
ence.
Williams may be singing 
about herself, but she’s far from 
alone on the record. Indie su-
pergroup boygenius (Phoebe 
Bridgers, Lucy Dacus, Julien 
Baker) sing ominous backing 
vocals on “Roses/Lotus/Violet/
Iris,” and Michael Weiss, gui-
tarist of noted Williams inﬂ  u-
ence mewithoutYou, lends his 
chops to the song “Creepin.” 
The array of inﬂ  uences and 
favorites she collaborates with 
brings even more of a personal 
touch to “Petals For Armor,” as 
if Williams is declaring that the 
record is a product of herself 
and everyone that makes her 
that way.
Many records with a length 
of 15 songs can suffer from 
a top-heavy quality, but that 
doesn’t happen on “Petals For Armor.” The album was actu-
ally released in installments of 
three different EPs, and as a 
result, there is very little ﬁ  ller 
when they are combined to cre-
ate the record. This style of re-
lease also lends the added bene-
ﬁ  t of an album that changes and 
weaves between styles, from 
the dark-pop ﬂ  air of the ﬁ  rst 
half of the record to the happy-
go-lucky ’80s romp of the mid-
dle section and back again.
Overall, “Petals for Armor” 
is a triumph for both Williams 
and fans of pop who are look-
ing for a delightfully varied 
and personal project. There’s 
no telling what will be next for 
Williams—be it another solo 
record or a return to the Para-
more name—but if this record 
is anything to go by, it’ll surely 
be something to look out for.

GET CREATIVE

Gainesville has been a little quiet 
lately. Douglas Palmieri didn’t like 
that.
Threatening the existence of 
independent music venues, the 
COVID-19 pandemic has left the 
Gainesville entertainment scene in-
venting ways to keep itself aﬂ  oat. 
Palmieri, 34-year-old Gainesville 
resident and owner of Gator Sound 
and Lighting, has built a fully func-
tioning stage, complete with lasers 
and lights, in his backyard. After 
Alachua County mandated the clo-
sure of all nonessential businesses 
and prohibited public gatherings of 
more than 10 people, Palmieri saw 
a need to support local entertainers 
and performers.
“I’m just trying to get any artists who want to play and entertain folks 
at home that can’t go anywhere,” he 
said. “It’s basically a giant promo 
thing.”
The stage, dubbed the “Quaran-
tine Stage,” has hosted two nights of 
performers so far. It’s part of a se-
ries called the Quarantine Sessions. 
While Palmieri’s backyard doesn’t 
host a real crowd, the DJs, bands 
and drag show performances are 
livestreamed to the public through 
Twitch at no cost. 
Palmieri said the 36-by-16-foot 
stage took him about 50 hours to set 
up for the ﬁ  rst show. For the second, 
more time was spent improving the 
overall setup.
After launching a Facebook fund-
raiser for electric, lighting and build-
ing expenses, Palmieri said he has 
seen community support for a Quar-
antine Stage 3.0. He plans on putting 
on this show at the end of May.
Rather than streaming from a 
stage, Gainesville’s High Dive is 
streaming artists from their living 
rooms, with their High Dive Live from Home livestream beneﬁ  t series. 
The ﬁ  rst livestream on May 3 con-
sisted of at-home performances by 
Gainesville artists Saint Simon, The 
Hails, Driveaway, Arrows in Action 
and The Forum. 
High Dive Facility and Events 
Manager Pat Lavery said the second 
installment will be at the end of May, 
with a new lineup of artists. 
“It kind of reminds people what 
we’re all about,” he said. “It’s really 
a nice, positive—almost like a tele-
thon kind of format—where people 
are expressing their interest and their 
affection for High Dive.”
As an independent venue, High 
Dive has been exploring avenues 
of support for itself, its staff and the 
artists it houses. In addition to High 
Dive Live from Home, the venue has 
launched the sale of a beneﬁ  t shirt 
and has joined the National Indepen-
dent Venue Association, a newly cre-
ated committee seeking federal relief 
and awareness for venues. 
“I think music and culture are al-
ways changing and you kind of have 
to adapt to it,” Lavery said.

TRY IMESSAGE 8-BALL AND 
NETFLIX PARTY

It’s been some time since my last col-
umn about “distance dating,” and I know 
I’m not alone in saying I’m so bored. There 
are only so many times I can send the 
“What are you up to?” text without ripping 
my hair out, especially considering the an-
swer will almost assuredly be “Nothing” 
these days. So while we’re all still doing our 
best to maintain social distancing, I wanted 
to take a look at fun ways to spice up ro-
mantic life from afar. 
For some people, the concept of distance 
dating is not new. Heather Sterchele is a 
21-year-old UF microbiology senior who 
has been long-distance for the majority of 
her ﬁ  ve-year relationship (thus, putting my 
two-month distance blues to shame). For 
someone who’s been dealing with long-dis-
tance for that long, She was bound to pick 
up some insightful tips and tricks for keep-
ing the spark alive. Yet, Sterchele’s biggest 
advice for those struggling with distance 
dating is simple.
“I think the biggest thing for right now, 
given the circumstances, is just continuing 
communication,” she said. “One big thing 
to make our time talking feel more mean-
ingful is to be fully engaged in the conversa-tion we’re having. That way, we both feel 
more valued.”
It’s true, communication is key when 
face-to-face interaction isn’t possible. How-
ever, what are some ways to make this com-
munication a little more exciting? I spoke to 
18-year-old UF biology sophomore Shaylin 
Ettinger, who had some great insights into 
how to stay in touch without touching.
“For Zoom date ideas, following a paint-
ing tutorial together and seeing who ends 
up with the better painting could be fun,” 
she said. “Or, following the same dinner 
recipe and seeing how it turns out for both 
of you.”
I can’t think of much that is more ro-
mantic than Bob Ross and his happy little 
trees.
Personally, I’ve found solace in the form 
of iMessage 8-Ball, FaceTimes and sending 
stupid tweets, but why not try something 
different? Dress up for a fancy virtual date, 
make each other a Spotify playlist and, of 
course, have a good old Netﬂ  ix Party.
As much as the obvious scantily clad 
Snapchat can be exciting for anyone, some-
times something a little different can make 
us feel even more connected. In a time that 
has physically pulled us all apart, maintain-
ing a sense of togetherness is vital. Stay safe 
and stay sexy.

COVID-19
By Bryan Matamoros
Sports Writer
It’s been nearly two months since COVID-19 
brought the world of sports to a halt.Social distancing measures have limited col-
legiate and professional athletes to the back-
yards of their own homes for training. Coaches, 
meanwhile, have been forced to learn more 
about Zoom than they signed up for.
Fans have suffered, too.
There’s typically a mixture of NBA, NHL 
and MLB games on any given night throughout 
the spring. College baseball and football tend to 
make the news as well.
Presently, though, there is none of that.
In the 61 days without sports, fans have 
found solace in the virtual rendition of the NFL 
Draft and ESPN's Michael Jordan documentary. 
However, with several states reopening gradual-
ly in May, there is a good opportunity for sports 
to make a comeback in the near future.
College Football
It’s never too early to talk about college foot-
ball, especially when spring practices are sup-
posed to be taking place. Normally, the chatter 
is about an incoming freshman or a backup 
quarterback vying for a starting role. This time around, the conversations deal with the pros-
pect of a 2020-21 season.
All but one (Vanderbilt) of the 14 schools 
in the SEC have stated their plans to hold in-
person classes for the upcoming fall semester, 
a crucial benchmark for the return of sports to 
college campuses.
Once every school in the SEC decides to re-
open, it will be easier for commissioner Greg 
Sankey to devise a plan for fall sports, which is 
good news for Gators football.
Major League Baseball
The 2020 MLB Draft will look much different 
than in previous years due to the coronavirus 
pandemic.
On Friday, Jeff Passan and Kiley McDaniel of 
ESPN reported that the draft would be cut from 
40 rounds to ﬁ  ve in an effort to save costs dur-
ing a time of ﬁ  nancial unrest.
Cutting down the draft will save each team 
about $1 million, but it will also result in more 
than 1,000 college players going undrafted.
Whoever goes undrafted has the possibil-ity of signing with any team for a maximum of 
$20,000.
With that being said, college baseball play-
ers will be faced with an interesting decision as 
to whether they do or do not sign with a team.
European Soccer
The German Bundesliga set itself apart from 
the rest of Europe’s top soccer leagues last week 
when it announced a return to action.
On Saturday, the likes of Borussia Dortmund 
and Wolfsburg will take the ﬁ  eld in competitive 
play after training under social distancing guide-
lines for most of April.
La Liga (Spain), the Premier League (Eng-
land) and Serie A (Italy) have yet to make ofﬁ  -
cial decisions regarding their respective seasons. 
Ligue 1 (France), on the other hand, crowned 
Paris Saint-Germain as champions since they 
had the most points when the season was ini-
tially stopped.
