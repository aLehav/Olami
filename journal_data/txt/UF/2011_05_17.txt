the weekend. 
See Story, Page 14.WASHINGTON — For a few joyful 
days, more than 20,000 people around the 
world thought they literally won the lottery and a chance to come and live legally in the United States. 
But, the State Department said Friday, it 
had computer problems and have to run the annual visa lottery again.
The decision reopens competition for 
50,000 wild-card visas for people who oth-erwise would have little hope of qualifying. About 15 million had applied,.
But the glitch, blamed on an in-house 
programming error, dashes the hopes of people like Max, a 28-year-old German man. 
“It’s like you won $100,000, and then 
they just take it away from you and it’s gone,” 
The State Department apologized.

n THE VENUE HAS BEEN OPEN FOR 15 YEARS.

Demand brought them here.  Demand for a new place to 
play shows. Demand to see the next big band Gainesville had 
to offer. Demand for a new place to meet old friends.
But some say that the tide of enthusiasm for local music 
has ebbed. Somewhere along the 15 years where Common 
Grounds acted as a veritable barometer for Gainesville music, the peak shifted and the crowds have thinned like the hair of 
diehard Gainesville musicians.
The last show brought out a crowd of about 50 to the cinder 
block tin-roofed warehouse that was once a feed store and sev-eral other night clubs at 210 SW Second Ave., but then again it 
was a Sunday.
Four bands   —Ancient River, Only Thieves, The Gris Gris 
Boys and Lindsey Mills and the Predators—took to the set up 
on the floor in front of the stage between two huge speakers sitting on steel drums.  All were from Gainesville, save Only Thieves, who were on the last night of their tour before head-ing home to Tallahassee. That’s the standard place setting for 
smaller shows, said Jason Rockhill, Common Grounds owner 
since 2004.
The crowd stood in a semi-circle at a 15-foot radius from 
the band. Some nursed PBR Tall Boys as they watched. A duo of young 20-somethings broke from the crowd to twirl to the heavy-hitting guitar of Only Thieves. Golden beer sloshed in their plastic cups at they swayed.
But this wasn’t always the norm.Rockhill said he’s seen nights when close to 200 sweaty bod-
ies jammed between the walls and churned up mosh pits for bands like Against Me! and Less Than Jake – both of Gainesville fame. He’s seen them pack in for the likes of Kenny Chesney, Zach Brown Band and Black Keys. He’s seen nights when the whole crowd sat on the floor to watch one man and his acoustic guitar. He’s seen calm nights and bar fights.
For the rest of the month, he said he plans to rekindle those 
shows by inviting back old favorites. Against Me! has already confirmed a gig on May 24. Rockhill said there will be more, 
but none that he can confirm yet.
“You hold the place together with spit and duct tape and 
whatever and whatever and, you know, you hope it all works 
out,” he said of his time here.
But at the end of next month, those nights will end, and 
Gainesville’s music scene will have to play another tune.
Asked why he was shutting the doors, Rockhill couldn’t 
point to any one reason. On the venue’s website, common-groundslive.com, he wrote that it was time to move on.
But smaller turnouts in recent years might have played a 
part.
“Obviously if this place was a gold mine, we wouldn’t be 
closing,” he said.
While Ancient River went through sound checks, Chris Wol-
lard, who made his name in Gainesville punk band Hot Water Music, slouched on a bar stool on the outdoor bar known only as “the porch” while he thought about the countless times he’s taken the stage.
He’s been coming since Common Grounds was just a cof-
fee shop at 919 W. University Ave. in 1995. In 2004, when the venue moved to the warehouse on Second Avenue, he made his mark on the place.
He ran his arm along the length of the forest green fence 
around the outdoor seating area. “I painted that.” He slapped the wood of the bar he was leaning on. “I painted this, too.” He pointed to a Miller High Life bar mirror a few feet above his head. “See that? I hung that there.”

Though UF President Bernie Ma-
chen promised no programs or per -
sonnel would be cut this year in the 
face of a $33-million-budget reduc-
tion, he can’t speak with confidence about the future. 
Undergraduate tuition will in-crease 15 percent every year for the 
next three years, faculty’s paid time 
off may be decreased, and if budget cuts from the state continue, pro-grams with low enrollment may be cut.
Machen addressed some of the 
university’s proposed immedi-ate and long-term solutions for the budget cuts that have hit UF for the fourth time in five years at a Faculty 
Senate meeting Thursday . 
“We’re going to try to find as 
many one-time revenue sources 
as we can 
to get us t h r o u g h most of 
next year,” Machen said, “but by a year from this summer, July ’12, we’ve got to have recurring rev-enues to cover that deficit.” 
For the 2011-2012 fiscal year, 
the budget gap will be covered by the tuition increase and the use of non-recurring funds, such as a $6 
million contribution from the Uni-
versity Athletic Association and the $3.8 million given to UF by the state.  
However, this is only a temporary fix.
Machen is looking into options such as increasing the amount of money auxiliary programs, such as the UAA or the Department of Hous-ing and Residence Education, must pay as overhead to operate within the university . Overhead costs for 
research may also be increased.  
There could also be changes to the 
structure of UF employees’ leave. For example, employees may now be required to use their leave for the

INDUSTRY, Pa. — Police say 
a Pennsylvania man has sur -
vived a lighting strike while 
helping set up tents for a Boy 
Scout outing.
Police in the town of Indus -
try say the 49-year-old man was 
standing by a tree hit when he 
was struck by a bolt of lightning 
at about 8:30 p.m. Saturday.
Industry officer Aaron Lopez 
says the man and others were 
moving scouts and camping 
supplies off the site as a thun -
derstorm approached.
Lopez says no children were 
nearby when the man was 
struck. The man was up and 
walking around when police 
arrived, though he was treated 
later at a hospital for a wound 
where the lightning bolt appar -
ently exited his body.
Police are not identifying the

despite long odds.
Duette Elementary in the

n THE FOOD DRIVE WILL CONTINUE 
THROUGH SATURDAY.
By EMILY MORROW
Alligator Writer
 
     Saturday’s thunderstorms did not disrupt 
Gainesville’s mail delivery, nor did they deter 
letter carriers from collecting 56,000 pounds of 
food for the nationwide Stamp Out Hunger 
food drive.
“It’s business as usual,” said Bill Logeson, Gainesville’s postmaster. “We still deliver 
mail today, so we’re still going to pick up the 
food.”
Now in its 19th year, Stamp Out Hunger 
occurs the second Saturday of every May 
and is the largest food drive in the nation.  
Primarily organized by the National Asso -
ciation of Letter Carriers, donations are left in 
mailboxes and picked up by letter carriers as 
they go along their usual mail routes.
While the rain poured down, Logeson 
and about 40 volunteers stood on the 34th 
Street post office’s covered loading dock.  The trucks started rolling in around 3 p.m. 
V olunteers unloaded 600 pounds of canned 
goods, peanut butter, cereal and pasta from 
each truck waiting trucks from four local food 
pantries receiving donations.
These donations come at a perfect time, 
Logeson said, as food 
pantries usually see an in -
crease in donations during 
the holiday season, but fall 
into a lull during the summer months.
Coordinators were expecting this year’s 
drive to surpass last year’s efforts, which col -lected 79,000 pounds of food.
The rain had a lot to do with the shortage, 
said Tony Tallerico, NALC food drive coordi -
nator.
Letter carriers will continue to pick up 
donations throughout the rest of the week.
Tallerico said he expects to see another 10,000 
pounds of food donated by Saturday.
“We probably won’t get that ultimate 
number we hit last year,” he said. “But every 
charity will still get 16,000 to 17,000 pounds of 
food. That should get them through the holi -
day season.”Mail carriers pick up, drop off food for national drive
AroundGainesvillen HE HAS ALSO WON HIS COLLEGE’S TEACHER OF 
THE YEAR AWARD. 
By GABRIELA ROSIAS
Alligator Contributing Writer
Jim Sullivan’s windowsill is running out of room. 
It is lined with awards he has received over the course of his 
three-year teaching career, including his personal favorite: the 
student-made “2011 Awesome Award.” 
In April, he had to find some more room when he was 
awarded the Associated Schools of Construction’s 2011 Na-
tional Teaching Excellence Award at the organization’s 47th Annual International Conference in Nebraska. 
Sullivan said his favorite part of the job was the quality of 
his students.
“The building construction students are great,” he said. 
“They are hard-working, diligent and fun. Teaching is like hav-
ing 60 construction interns at a job site.”
Christopher Silver, dean of the College of Design, Construc-
tion and Planning, said Sullivan is one of the more popular pro-
fessors among students because of the time and personalized attention he gives them.
Sullivan, a UF alumnus, has been teaching at the school for 
the past three years. He is in charge of  construction techniques and surveying classes, and also teaches graduate-level sustain-ability courses.
He first became interested in building construction because 
of a job he took to pay for his undergraduate degree in adver -
tising and master’s degree in mass communication.
After working a part-time construction job to pay for class-
es, he said he realized it was his calling. He went on to get a master’s degree and doctorate in building construction. 
Sullivan became involved in the construction business, but 
then realized teaching better fit his lifestyle. And he’s been racking up awards ever since.Not only has Sullivan been recognized nationally, said 
Silver, but he also received the college’s Teacher of the Year Award and the Dean’s Faculty Service Award at the school’s commencement ceremony.
“He has a lot of interaction with students, likes working 
with them and he’s good at it,” Silver said. “I’m not surprised he won.”4, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, MAY 17, 2011

For fans, venue’s close marks end of era
Inside is a hodgepodge of odds and 
ends Rockhill found to decorate the 
place. Most of the lighting comes from strings of Christmas lights hanging on the walls year round. Tables are made 
with 40-gallon steel drums. Deer heads 
and stuffed fish hang on the walls.
In the men’s bathroom, illegible 
graffiti written in silver sharpie covers a “right lane must turn right” street sign. Band names are drunkenly etched into corners. Torn posters promoting the last few shows hang above urinals.
Dianya Markovits, 33, a regular for 
the past six years, said she’ll remember those as the cleanest bathrooms of any Gainesville venue.
She remembers her first time getting 
coffee when she was in college in 1998 when it was still on University Avenue. 
She saw Against Me! for the first time 
there in 2000.
Every week, she checked the web-
site for show listings, usually finding something she liked.
“When I went out, I wanted to come 
here,” she said. “This was my spot.”
As the Gris Gris Boys, a Southern 
punk band, took the last spot for the night, hoots from friends in the audi-ence welcomed them on.
Rob MgGregor, 44, pounded out 
chords on his Gibson SG. From the neck up, with short hair and glasses, he 
looked like someone you might find in 
a cubicle on a weekday. But his brown T-shirt, skinny black jeans and sneak-ers said otherwise. As a member of 11 Gainesville bands that he can name off the top of his head over 25 years, he reckons he’s played around 70 shows at Common Grounds. He even played in the same room when it was under the 
name The Covered Dish, a name only 
Gainesville locals fondly look back on.
This would be one of the last.For McGregor, the close means more 
than finding another place to play. It’s a sign of dwindling support for live mu-sic in his town.
“When [people] talk about 
Gainesville, they talk about the 
Gainesville murderer, the Gators and 
the Gainesville music scene,” he said.GROUNDS , from page 1By EMILY MORROW

By 2016, students will be able to sit in their dorm 
room chairs free from the constant fear of falling 
backward.
The Department of Housing and Residence Edu-
cation announced Thursday its plans to replace all 
the student room furniture in residence halls by 
2016. 
The department has an ongoing replacement plan 
for residence hall furniture, but Sharon Blansett, the assistant director of housing, said the depart-ment had fallen behind schedule on replacements.  
“We decided that to catch up, we needed to replace all of the student furniture in the next five years,” she said. “Then we can start fresh.”
Upward of 7,500 beds, mat-
tresses, dressers, desks and desk chairs will be replaced by furni-ture designed to be space-efficient and look more modern. 
About 25 percent of student residence hall furni-
ture will be replaced this summer, beginning with Beaty Towers, Simpson Hall, Tolbert Hall, North Hall and late application triples campuswide — a 
project that will cost about $2.4 million.
Broward East and Weaver Hall will get new desk 
chairs, and all lounge furniture will be replaced in 
Jennings Hall.
The total cost of the five-year project is estimated 
to be more than $7.5 million.
Though the university is facing budget cuts from 
the state, the department of housing is an auxiliary program whose budget comes strictly from the rent 
paid by students.
“These are not state tax monies that are so tight 
right now,” Blansett said. “These are monies that 
we’ve saved and budgeted over the years so we can do things like this.”Dorms to get

The Southwest Recreation Center’s weight room is under -
going a serious face lift this summer following a $16.3 million 
expansion completed last fall.
The cost of the renovation will be covered by money left 
over from the expansion funded by the Capital Improvement Trust Fund.
Out-of-date and worn out equipment will be replaced 
and dumbbells will be added along with an Olympic-style weight section that will include half racks, bumper weights and chalk.
At least 12 staff members, some from the current pool of 
about 100 student employees along with some new hires, will 
be certified to assist lifters in the Olympic-style section.
The renovation should also take care of congestion as stu-
dents crowd in for Fall-semester workouts. 
Part of the numbers problem lies in the floor, said Katie 
Roberts, a fitness coordinator at Southwest Rec. She said much 
of the current flooring isn’t able to handle heavy weights dropped on it, so most of the free weights are restricted to certain areas.
A new flooring system designed for the abuse of a heavy 
duty weight room, known as Infinity Floors, will allow weights to be spread out over a larger area, Roberts said.
Two industrial-strength ceiling fans known as Big Ass 
Fans will be installed to combat the heat and control air flow. 
The renovation includes aesthetic touches as well.For those who use the weight room during peak hours, 
the dozens of sweaty people mixed with poor circulation can drive the temperature up.
“It gets really hot back here when it’s crowded,” said 
Brooke Burkins, a sophomore biology student.
The light fixtures will be replaced with a more energy-ef-
ficient model that produces more light per unit. Water-bottle-filling dispensers will be installed, and the stark-white walls will receive a fresh coat of paint along with Gator-themed vinyl graphics. 
Burkins said the new look will make her want to work out 
more. 
“A sweet place to work out motivates you,” she said.The weight room will remain open throughout the reno-
vation. Southwest adds new weight room

Improved conditions in Hai-
ti have led university officials to 
revise the UF policy for travel to the country where a devastat-
ing 7.0 magnitude earthquake 
occurred in January 2010.
The amended policy, ef-
fective Sunday, now permits 
graduate students to travel to 
Haiti so long as they have a compelling reason, said David Sammons, dean of the UF Inter -
national Center. 
The new policy does not 
require UF faculty and staff to get approval from the Interna-tional Center before traveling 
to Haiti. 
“We’ve had quite a few 
graduate students and faculty 
members return,” Sammons said. “And it has reached a 
point where the restrictions 
don’t seem to be necessary any longer.”
Sammons said they will con-
tinue to prohibit undergradu-
ates from traveling to Haiti 
unless they are part of a formal group approved by the univer -
sity and accompanied by an ex-
perienced faculty member. 
The travel policy does not 
apply to any personal travel 
plans of faculty, staff and stu-dents.UF administration 
lifts restrictions on travel to Haiti
Faculty’s vacation, sick 
leave may be reduced
four days they’re given off when 
the university is closed between Christmas and New Year’s. Sick and vacation leave may also be cut down from seven weeks to 
five weeks.
If the state legislature con-
tinues to make cuts to the 
university’s budget, Ma-chen said, more drastic mea-sures may have to be taken.  
Increases in distance-learning programs and out-of-state stu-dent enrollment, a postponement 
of the opening of the Harn Asian 
wing, and cuts to the budgets of administration and individ-ual colleges are all on the table.  
“So, what can you do?” Machen asked the faculty present at the meeting. “I’m ready to engage ideas. There may be things we 
haven’t thought of.”
The Faculty Senate also 
passed two bills regarding UF 
programs. 
The first would create a School 
of Advanced Dental Sciences, a school within the College of Dentistry that would include the 
endo-
dontics, 
ortho-dontics, 
pediatric dentistry and perio-dontology departments as well as a prosthodontic graduate pro-gram.  
The second bill created an 
international studies bachelor’s 
degree program within the Col-
lege of Liberal Arts and Sciences.  
Both bills must be approved by the Board of Trustees before they can go into effect.FACULTY , from page 1 n STATE SPENDING WAS

When Kat DiManno teaches her 
kindergarten class about plants, 
she knows she could stand in front of them and just tell them how it all works. 
But buying supplies with her 
own money and building a 3-D model with her students is the kind of thing DiManno does. At least it’s the kind of thing she will do until she loses three percent of her pay.
As a public employee, Di-
Manno may have to contribute 3 percent of her annual salary to her retirement as part of the $69.7 bil-lion budget approved by Florida’s Congress on Saturday . The budget cut state spending by almost $4 billion.Gov . Rick Scott now has the bill and may either finalize or veto it.
For Alachua County Public 
Schools, this will mean a net loss of $7.3 million. School Board rep-resentative Eileen Roy estimated the state budget cuts would result in a 5 to 10 percent budget loss for county schools.
Wiley Dixon, Gainesville High 
School principal, said his biggest fear is that retirement-age teachers 
will leave the profession and col-
lege students will see the field as undesirable.“Unless things turn around, 
there is going to be a critical teach-er shortage in Florida,”he said.
DiManno said that while the 
automatic deduction of 3 percent of her salary for retirement will have an impact on her lifestyle, it’s the loss of professional services contracts that upsets her.
.Not everyone opposes the 
changes, though. Buchholz High School American government and American history teacher Jared Taber said the effects of the new budget could have been a lot worse.
He expected the cuts and views 
them as teachers doing their part 
to help keep the economy afloat.
“It’s probably necessary in the 
times we’re in right now,” he said.

Catholic Church once 
again fails to address sins
In a clumsy attempt to salvage its ever-decaying name, 
the Roman Catholic Church released a letter Monday 
assuring the world that despite its proclivity for ma -
neuvering through  tripwires of legal culpability, it’s will -
ing to play ball when it comes to its darkest secret.
“Sexual abuse of minors is not just a canonical delict 
but also a crime prosecuted by civil law,” the letter from 
the Church’s Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith stat -
ed. “Although relations with civil authority will differ in 
various countries, nevertheless it is important to cooperate 
with such authority within their responsibilities.”
In other breaking news from the High Council of Di -
vine Obviousness, water has won its petition to remain 
wet, summer has decided it will continue to be hot, and 
Cleveland sports teams remain irrelevant.
While the words printed in the letter carry hints of com -
passion and a tinge of contriteness, it comes as nothing 
more than antiquated, over-embellished ceremony that 
may have worked in yore but carries little weight now, 
similar to the church itself. 
The most glaring aspect of the letter revolves around 
not any statements included but those excluded. Though 
the church made recommendations on how to deal with 
the problem of sexual abuse, it did not lay out any explicit 
regulations or consequences that specifically deal with 
sexual abuse. 
Simply put, the letter is filled with more “shoulds” than 
“shall nots.”  With many calling for the church to actually 
wield a strong hand against the abuse that has affected un -
told numbers in the United States and across the world, the 
church decided to once again throw up its hands and cling 
to subjunctives instead of directly confronting not only a 
religious problem but also a human rights problem. 
When pressed on the issue, a Vatican spokesman said 
the church could not implement a universal edict for the 
mandatory reporting to local authorities because “each re -
ality is different, culturally and from the point of view of 
different countries’ laws.”
Translation: “You know how much of a pain in  the ass 
it would be to try to enforce this thing?  It would take — 
dare we say — ‘supernatural strength’ to actually pull this 
thing off. Let’s just blow more white smoke up to the heav -
ens; the aroma pleases God.”
Well here on earth it smells like complete, beatified 
bullshit. While we’re not naïve to think that the church has 
the power to place its foot down and crush this serpent’s 
head once and for all, it does have the power to stop drag -
ging its feet. 
In the Gospels, Jesus is quoted as saying “Whosoever 
shall offend one of [these] little ones that believe in me, it 
is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his 
neck, and he were cast into the sea.” 
The need for granite has never been greater.
The shuffling of clerical child molesters between par -
ishes, particularly in Europe, resembles a cruel game of 
carnival three-cup and needs to come to a swift end. 
The time has come for Philadelphia pedophilia house 
cleanings, not calls for “healing” through backdoor deal -
ing.
If not, expect no forgiveness from us.
Hipsters: A (De-)Evolution Like No Other
They’re really obscure. You’ve probably never heard of 
them.
They’ve grown strong. They have cluttered the 
grounds of Gainesville, evolving from the primordial grass 
roots of their ancestors.
The enemies of our past have changed with the times. 
They are no longer the simple, passive, drug-abusing, tie-
dyed, nomadic, sexually deviant,  environmentally-con -
scious, “free loving,” smelly, barefoot degenerates of yore. 
A new generation has embraced the mindset of hippies 
and blended it with arrogance. They mark themselves with 
inked astrological symbols. They treat Pabst Blue Ribbon as 
if it is the gods’ ambrosia.  They describe themselves by rare 
artistic expressions created by other people, never by any 
personal merit. Without any visual impairment, they equip 
large black framed glasses for cosmetic purposes alone. They 
have androgynous hairstyles that can confuse even the most 
effeminate. 
“You haven’t heard of the band Moonlit Rose Petals? You 
know nothing of fine arts.” 
Society calls these creatures “hipsters.”
How did they come to be? Long ago, when hippies were 
cast into the dredge of society , an acid trip among members 
of the Council of Free Love resulted in a random thought 
that, contrary to hippie nature, turned out to be genius. The 
plan was to isolate the central characteristics of hippie culture 
as a “sleeper gene” in the genetic code of their offspring. First 
generation children of hippies showed no apparent signs of 
“free-love” hippie bullshit. When prompted with any aspect 
of the hippie mentality , these children felt the burn of evil 
across their skin and vomited profusely, as is the normal re -
action to hippie sentiments. With no hippie characteristics, 
these men and women became perfectly acceptable, success -
ful members of society . 
But the hippies had planned for this. The sleeper gene 
emerged in the following generation. The “free-love” sen -
timent of hippies, although nauseating, was never capable of caustic destruction. Somewhere 
in transcription, “free-love” was lost 
and elitist entitlement, obscurity and 
the arrogant assumption of individu -
al supremacy was attained. 
Hey, it could be worse. It could be 
Scientology.
Luckily, hipsters are not driven to 
any type of solidarity or teamwork. 
Hipsters are incredibly self-centered 
and currently lack the focus to infect the masses. Luckily 
their funding is better spent on improving their collection of 
ironic T-shirts. 
They infiltrate new technological regions of society that 
hippies were incapable of infesting. They defile the Internet 
with blogs pertaining to the urgency behind their pretentious -
ness. They punish right-minded individuals with a complete 
denial of rationality and logic, choosing to endorse whining 
and bitching as the sole means of action. Anything less than 
Nietzsche is considered paltry. A hipster believes that anyone 
who disagrees is an ignorant fool even though hipster logic 
is based not at all on evidence or facts and solely on emotions 
and “gut feelings.” Hipsters are intellectually snobbish even 
though they lives rely on factors that ironically contain noth -
ing intellectual.  Whereas hippies held hands and spoke of 
peace, hipsters dedicate their lives to competitive elitism. 
With very few actions, we can approach the dramatic con -
quest of an evil enemy a la Independence Day only with less 
explosions. 
As long as you stay strong. If you become infected, once 
you notice the tell-tale signs of douchebaggery , it will be too 
late.
 I sense dark times ahead.  The End of Days is coming. 
Expect an all-out war. 
But, make sure to be on the right side.

Editor’s Note: Across the world, millions struggle with addiction 
to alcohol and drugs. These are the stories, as best as he can remem-
ber them, of one of those compulsive personalities.
“My name’s Jack. I’m an alcoholic. It’s been six years since my last drink.” 
The chorus “Hi Jack, Hi Jack,” resonates from 
the folding chairs of the unused Presbyterian church hall.
For two months, I’ve been wasting time at the  “Plug in the 
Jug.”  
Subjected to Jack’s story, I take a long drag of my Marlboro 
Light and search for the Styrofoam cup that holds my fourth coffee in the last 30 minutes. 
“If anyone thinks I don’t belong here, let me tell you about 
my arrest,” Jack says.  “One night, I got drunk and robbed an appliance warehouse.” 
Jack stuffs a cookie into his mouth and pauses for dramatic 
impact while he chews.
He continues. “I had three TVs stacked in the alley outside 
the warehouse. By then I sobered up a bit and realized the rob-bery wasn’t that well-planned. I was using a bicycle to make my getaway .”    
I turn to the weathered face next to me.“That’s it. I’m outta here. I can’t be this screwed up. I don’t 
belong here.”
“You don’t belong here?” he says.“No way I’m as whacked out as these guys.”“Your dad a drunk?”“Yeah.”“His dad a drunk?”
“Yeah.”
“But you don’t belong here?”“No.”“You’ll be back,” his stone-face says. “I’ll save you a seat.” 
n n n
 
The bartender pushes the pitcher of beer at Patsy while he 
snatches his fiver and says, “What’s that funny smell?” 
 Turkish cigarettes,” I yell. “ I roll them myself.”
 “They smell like shit,” Cliff says.
“Yeah, but they’re cheap.”
My pal Patsy places Cliff’s fresh poured pitcher on the 
round table a safe distance away from where I’ve placed the 
mescaline. 
The wax paper contains a pile of gelatin mixed with the hal-
lucinogen.
When I need more rushes, laughter or energy ripples, I sim-
ply touch my index finger to my tongue and dip it into the pile of strawberry concentrate.My friend passes me a joint. 
It’s 1964, and I’m 16 years old in the Bronx. The other six 
customers don’t have a clue.  Few do in the early 1960s. Only jazz musicians and hipsters smoked pot.  The legal drinking age is 18, but this 
joint checks library cards. This dump would be empty without us.  All but Bob, the ex-marine, are underage.    
I date Bob’s daughter. After Korea, he 
did five years in Dannemora for armed robbery . Last month, Bob turned me on to pot.
“No f****** way Bob. Not after you’ve 
been drinking, no way. I don’t care how 
old you are. Can’t be done, impossible.”
Bob says, “I’ll bet you $5. We’ll do it right now. I have a so-
phisticated palate.”
“You’re telling me after getting loaded all night, you can 
taste three glasses of draught and tell the difference between Rheingold, Schaeffer or Budweiser? You got a bet.”
We blindfold Bob, line up the three seven-ounce glasses, 
and he sips. “This one’s Schaeffer.”
I’m impressed.“This one’s Budweiser.” I’m astonished.“Of course, the last one’s Rheingold.”Remarkable. I hand him his pound and applaud.Hours later, I’m whacked. Bob leaves and Cliff calls me to 
the bar. 
“I didn’t want to start any problems before, but all these 
taps plug into Schaeffer kegs. It’s on sale this month, so that’s all we got.”
n n n
“Hey mom, you know who died?”“No. Who?”“Mike Fitzmaurice.”Her thick brogue registers surprise. “Mike Fitzmaurice? 
Dead?  Is he? But sure, he didn’t drink at all.”
“Mom, there’s other ways people die. Not everyone dies of 
drink.”  
 n n n
I’m in the back of the city bus that takes me to the Catholic 
prep school where I’m a senior. Amid the confusion of cigarette smoke and chatter, I’m squinting for the third time at a letter 
my older brother sent me from France. 
“Paris is getting a little boring,” he says.  “In August, I think 
I’ll jump up to Belgium, maybe cross the channel and have a 
few laughs in England.”
I refold the letter and replace it back within my blazer pock-
et.
Weaned on movies about exotic locals, such as “Macao” and 
“Casablanca,” I’m seething.
I peer through the monotony of white shirts and blazers out 
at the gray streets.
I’m stuck in a five-flight walk-up with a lunatic for an old man, yet Tim finds the Air Force and Paris a little boring.                         
I loosen my tie: the Bronx in June. Why didn’t I pick a seat 
by the window? 
n n n          
      
, The streets, change.  No one plays stickball anymore. Drugs 
pour in fast and furious. Everything places a distant second to getting high.  
“Hey Billy man, you gotta cigarette?”
Kenny stops me as I walk up the street toward my apart-
ment building. 
I reach into my shirt pocket, and for the first time see clearly 
the deteriorating mess that only a year before had been the 
neighborhood quarterback. Kenny’s nose runs, his eyes nod, his dirty fingernails scratch the undernourished arm that pro-trudes from his filthy T-shirt.
 Kenny’s not alone.Paul sits on the stoop and always has his face enveloped in 
a No. 2 brown paper bag. I thought, “This guy’s going nowhere fast.”       
I’m wrong. Two years later, Paul the glue-freak becomes 
Ace Frehley , the lead guitarist of Kiss. 
Other friends joined the service. Vince and Charley already 
“bought the farm” in Vietnam. 
Shit, the war’s real. Guys are dying. If I join the service, 
maybe I’ll die too.  
Nonsense. I’m too “street smart” to die.
n n n
When heroin moves into the neighborhood, I decide it’s 
time to ship out. If I leave my friends and the neighborhood, I’ll stay sober. 
I’m an immigrant. I owe my country. I’m off to  defend the 
Vietnamese from themselves.  
Who’s more qualified to decide Southeast Asia’s fate than a 
blue-eyed, blond-haired 19-year-old Irishman with a drinking problem? 
Besides defending my country, I’ll see the world and get 
clean and sober. What are the chances Southeast Asia has 
drugs?   
n n n
This column will provide a hazy stumble down memory 
lane. Some will find the stories funny, others offensive; hope-
fully no one finds them boring.  Another Irishman, Oscar Wil-de, famously said, “Nothing succeeds like excess.” 
I spent a lifetime proving him wrong.  Bill O’Connor is a Vietnam veteran, former Bronx firefighter and 
pub and restaurant owner. O’Connor is currently a journalism ma-jor at UF and a standup comic. The irreverent and acerbic O’Connor performs free standup around Gainesville.Lost in the sauce: A hazy stumble down memory laneColumn
It’s here. Graduation day. Maybe you’re a parent 
watching your child graduate. Perhaps you’re 
actually graduating. You might be the guy who 
takes tickets.
No matter who you are, congratulations for get-
ting to this point in your life. 
I urge you to do one thing: Do not go to grad school.
Most grad students be-
come teaching assistants, or TAs. I assume most grad students do not want to pursue teaching for their en-
tire career. If they do, I’m pretty worried about the 
quality of teachers coming out of grad schools.
IHaving a graduate degree is not going to guaran-
tee you a job It’s not just about the degree. It’s about experience.
So congratulations, graduates. Don’t go back to 
school. Head on out into the world and show ‘em what you’ve got.

Lord’s Healing
By ASHLEY LOMBARDO
Alligator Writer
Jay Lord, 51, has been struggling 
with myelodysplastic syndrome for the last three years of his life.  
Also known as preleukemia, this disorder is the inability of the body to create blood cells. MDS causes Lord to be extremely anemic. 
To combat the anemia and keep 
him alive, his body requires weekly transfusions. However, a person can only withstand so many transfu-sions because of iron overload.
The most effective way to fight 
this disease is stem cell surgery . But because of a weak liver caused by iron overload and excessive drink-ing when he was younger, Lord will be unable to withstand the proce-
dure. Currently, he is undergoing a 
type of chemotherapy called arsenic 
trioxide. 
The treatment requires him to be 
in the hospital five days a week for 
two consecutive weeks. 
He has two weeks off between 
treatments but still must visit the 
hospital weekly if blood transfu-sions are needed.
Ashley Lombardo/Alligator
Top Left:  A few vials of blood are taken each time Lord comes in for a transfusion to test his blood count. MDS leaves him extremely anemic. 
Top Right: Lord’s open port is protected from in -
fection and bacteria by a type of tape that helps 
keep out moisture. It is impossible to take a show -
er when the port is taped, so he has to sponge off in the sink. He says after a few days of that “you’re jonesing for a shower.”
Center: People mistake Jay Lord’s medical mask 
for him having some type of contagious disease.in fact, Lord’s white blood cell count is often so low that he puts himself at risk by things as sim-ple as eating raw fruits and vegetables.
Bottom Right: Hospital visits have become so rou -
tine that he calls the nurses his “angels” and the 
hospital his “home away from home”.
Bottom Left: “It’s a waiting game,” Lord says. 
When he goes in for his weekly transfusions it is not uncommon to sit in the ward for a few hours while the blood is cleaned and readied to go.Man struggles with illness

This part-time, entry level position primar-
ily involves working on websites and online 
publications for our clients using HTML, CSS 
and basic image manipulation. We code web-
sites by hand (no visual website generators 
such as Frontpage), so at least entry level 
to intermediate HTML and CSS skills are re-
quired. Graphic design and layout skills may 
be helpful, but are not necessary since most 
of the work involves adding content to exist-
ing websites. About 20 hours per week with 
flexible scheduling. The position does have 
the potential for long term growth into other 
positions within our company.

POLL RESULTS QUOTABLE MOYER TWEETS INJURYBy JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Writer
 
With just five events left on the 
final day of the 2011 Southeastern 
Conference Outdoor Champion-
ships, the Gators were primed for a clean sweep.
The No. 2 men’s team held a 
28-point lead over No. 11 Arkansas 
following Terrell Wilks’ win in the 
100-meter dash and earlier victories in the triple jump and 4x100-meter relay. Meanwhile, the unranked 
women’s squad clung to a 96-95 ad-
vantage over top-ranked LSU.
But instead of closing strong in 
Athens, Ga., both Florida teams inexplicably collapsed down the 
stretch to disappointing second-
place finishes.
“I never thought we were in a 
bad place at any point in time over 
the weekend,” UF coach Mike Hol-
loway said. “The bottom line is we weren’t the best team there this weekend. We had some adversity 
and we couldn’t overcome it, they 
had some and they overcame it so kudos to Arkansas and coach [Chris] Bucknam.”
The Razorbacks reeled off two 
wins in the final five races to pull off a 45-point swing, taking the title by a final margin of 157.50 to 140.
Holloway pointed to sprinter Jeff 
Demps’ false start disqualification in the 100m preliminaries and an injury to distance runner Dumisane Hlaselo, as major potential points 
lost for the Gators.
Both runners won events at the 
SEC Indoor Championships in Feb-
ruary.
“Not having Dumi in any event 
hurts us,” Holloway said. “He’s one of the elite runners in the country and not having him, Omar Crad-dock being hurt and Jeff false start-
ing, there’s a lot of things that came 
into play. But we’re not going to

Spring football practice is over, so they 
tell me. And the Orange and Blue Debut came and went unspectacularly.
That means you fans in the Gator Nation 
must wait until August to see or hear anything 
tangible related to the football team. (Remem-
ber, arrest reports don’t count.) 
But that also means the time for all-impor -
tant prognostication is upon us. 
On cue, Urban Meyer, as part of his new 
gig as a college football analyst for ESPN, ap-peared recently on a College Football Live segment to break down the Gators football team and their expectations for the upcoming 
season. 
(The “experts” have Florida ranked No. 
18 in their way-too-early, dead-wrong-by-fall 
preseason rankings.) 
If you happened to be away from the 
couch for this gem of television greatness, you missed some outstandingly awkward back-and-forth from a panel featuring Kirk Herb-streit and Robert Smith, alongside Meyer and former Gators quarterback Jesse Palmer. 
It opened with Smith wondering how Will 
Muschamp would restructure the Florida football program after it sunk beneath the ev-er-lofty expectations in Meyer’s last season. 
All while Meyer sat two chairs away. Awk-
ward, as the kids say .  
Palmer stepped in and said Muschamp has 
already changed lots of things at Florida, in-cluding closing spring practice to the public. Much to the chagrin  of Gators fans. Smil-ing ear-to-ear, wrinkles 
showing from years on 
the sidelines, Meyer quipped, “Glad I didn’t do that.”
The star-studded 
panel went on to dis-
cuss such important topics as entitlement issues, blue-collar mentalities, playing with ‘fire,’ team psychologists and whether Char -
lie Weis was a great hire or the greatest hire. But what does all that mean in terms of actual football? You don’t need me to tell you. Abso-lutely squat.
So let’s take a look at five real issues facing 
the Gators this season:
1 –John Brantley. Is he the guy?
In the last 30 seconds of the segment, Mey-
er said quarterbacks receive too much praise for winning, and too much blame for losing. While true, Brantley still must prove he’s the 
caliber of quarterback necessary to win in 
the Southeastern Conference. Regardless of Meyer’s public stance on Brantley, no one can deny the quarterback has the most direct ef-fect on a team’s success of any other position.  If the Gators are going to be great, Brantley Disregard the talking heads: 
Five real issues facing Gators
n THE SOPHOMORE LEADS THE CONFERENCE IN RBIs, RUNS

While craziness ensued this week-
end during No. 6 Florida’s dramatic 
series victory over No. 7 Vanderbilt, 
an unfailing presence emerged yet again to thrust the Gators back into the Southeastern Conference Eastern 
Division race. 
All year, Mike Zunino, the soph-
omore catcher and son of a Major 
League Baseball scout, has con-
ducted Florida’s accelerating train 
toward a conference championship and potential spot in the College World Series.
On Sunday, the right-handed 
slugging backstop unloaded two bombs including the game-winning three-run home run in extra-innings 
as the Gators (39-13, 20-7 SEC) tied 
the Commodores (42-8, 20-7 SEC) for first place in the East. 
Zunino’s shot not only broke the 
lengthy deadlock, but it likely ce-
mented his candidacy as the lead-
ing contender for SEC Player of the 
Year. 
“There’s no better 
guy you want up in that situation,” coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “He’s got pres-ence in the box.”
Zunino had struggled in his brief 
career against Vanderbilt, batting just 1 for 19 before knocking a solo homer in the seventh inning Sunday. 
The backstop drove in five of Flori-
da’s six runs, the third time this sea-UF’s Zunino powers way

Baseball THE SENIOR BECAME UF’S ALL-TIME 
WINNINGEST PLAYER WITH TWO VICTORIES SUNDAY IN THE NCAA REGIONAL
By THOMAS NASSIFF
Alligator Writer
 
Alexandre Lacroix is going to graduate this 
summer.
After four years of studying at UF, Lacroix is 
about to earn his degree in business management 
at the conclusion of the summer term. 
But clearly, before his time at Florida ends, La-
croix wanted to do a little more writing. 
On Sunday, he rewrote Florida’s record books.The Gators’ senior leader, who coach Andy 
Jackson has praised throughout the season for be-ing a role model both on the court and in the class-
room, became UF’s all-time winningest player 
after propelling Florida to a 4-0 win against rival Miami in the second round of the NCAA Tourna-ment at Linder Stadium.
With the win, the Gators captured an NCAA 
Regional to go along with the Southeastern Con-ference Tournament trophy they earned April 24. 
In the last match Lacroix will ever play in front 
of a home crowd, he earned his 209th and 210th 
career wins to move ahead of Justin O’Neal on 
Florida’s career wins list.
“I thought about it a little because I knew I was 
close to the record,” Lacroix said. 
“It feels amazing in my last home match beat-
ing this record. I know there’s been a lot of great players at Florida, and it feels great to get a couple of wins to finish it up.”
The senior captured the record with an 8-2 dou-
bles victory with partner Sekou Bangoura Jr.  
Lacroix later defeated Keith Crowley in straight 
sets in singles. 
The usually reserved Lacroix looked up and ac-
knowledged the roaring crowd — a small thank-
you for their years of support.
With Florida advancing to the Sweet 16, Lacroix isn’t finished yet. The ultimate goal — a national 
championship —  is still in his sights.
“We feel like we’ve got a chance, but we’ve 
only got a chance because of Alex,” Jackson said.
“If anybody else gets injured or doesn’t play 
well, we’ve got some other guys we can put in to 
sort of pick up the slack. 
But we’re very dependent on Alex, and he’s ob-
viously been very dependable this year. We’re ex-
cited about giving him a chance to lead us further when we get out to Palo Alto.”

By the fourth rain delay of the Gators’ 
first ever NCAA Tournament game, both Florida and Stanford had been sitting in the hallways of UF’s lacrosse facility for five hours.
Teammates from both sides mingled and 
talked, drifting in and out of their locker rooms. Others passed the time with a cou-ple rounds of Travel Scrabble.
As UF coach Amanda O’Leary said, it 
was not the ideal start to No. 4-seed Flor -
ida’s 13-11 win over 13th-seeded Stanford (16-3, 6-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa-
tion).
“I’m thinking, ‘Oh, boy’ this is our first 
one, these girls have never played in an 
NCAA Tournament game before,” O’Leary said. “So I was a little concerned with how 
they would handle sitting in the locker 
room for four to five hours, but obviously, they came out ready to go and ready to play.”
From the opening draw, it was apparent 
which team had the fresher legs and the bet-ter conditioning leading up to the game.
The Gators (16-3, 5-0 American Lacrosse 
Conference) owned the first three posses-sions in the half and sprinted out to a 4-0 
lead on a five-minute hat trick from sopho-more Kitty Cullen.
Each goal came as a result from a quick 
strike in transition, where Florida exploited Stanford’s inability to get back on defense.
“I thought the speed was a factor, but 
once our team got it settled, I thought our 
defense did a relatively good job,” Cardinal 
coach Amy Bokker said.
Stanford clawed its way back into the 
game and only trailed 5-4 at halftime, but 
Florida again punished the visitors from the opening draw to start the second.
Midfielder Janine Hillier, who tied a 
career-high with four goals, blasted a shot past Cardinal goalie Annie Read just 20 seconds into the period, while sophomore 
Brittany Dashiell (three goals, two assists) 
scooped up the resulting draw and fired an-other goal just 22 ticks later.
“We still pulled through with our speed 
throughout the whole game,” Dashiell said. 
“I think that showed because we scored a 
lot of goals through transition, and we re-ally exploited their weaknesses and played them to our strengths.”
After Cullen’s fourth goal brought the 
game to its final 13-11 margin, the Gators simply played keep-away from Stanford’s defenders over the last 4:30, weaving through traffic and double teams.
“Our young women are just so well con-
ditioned,” O’Leary said. “[UF Strength and Conditioning coach] Karen Werth does a fantastic job with them, so I knew that any one of them could run the ball around for 
any amount of time — and they have the 
heart to do it.”With the win, Florida advances to play 
No. 5-seed Duke (14-4, 4-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) next Saturday at 3 p.m. in Gainesville with an NCAA semifinal berth on the line.TUESDAY, MAY 17, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 15

UF outlasts delays, Stanford in first NCAA Tournament gameBy THOMAS NASSIFF

Florida’s women’s ten-
nis team compiled 25 wins, 
a Southeastern Conference regular-season championship and an SEC Tournament tro-phy before hosting an NCAA Regional last weekend.
But an NCAA Regional 
was uncharted territory for half the team.
Florida’s normal singles 
lineup includes three players 
— Allie Will, Lauren Embree 
and Joanna Mather — who 
have vivid memories of last 
year’s deep run to the NCAA 
Tournament final. But the other half of the lineup fea-
tures three heralded freshmen 
who, despite having success 
all year, had  never played in 
an NCAA Tournament.
With the help of fresh-
men Olivia Janowicz, Sofie 
Oyen and Alex Cercone, the 
Gators dominated the first two rounds of the tournament at Linder Stadium over the 
weekend. On Sunday, Florida 
blanked South Carolina 4-0, 
clinching a berth in the Sweet 16 on Friday against Clem-son.
Coach Roland Thornqvist gave a simple answer when asked to evaluate the play of his freshmen in their first NCAA Regional.
“Well, I guess you could 
say so far, so good,” Thorn-qvist said.
Mather said her job as the 
team’s de facto leader hasn’t 
proved to be difficult this 
year, saying the trio of rook-
ies came in “determined and willing to work just as hard as anyone else has worked on 
this team.”
That driving focus was on 
display dur -
ing region-
als as Jano-
wicz shined 
with Mather 
in doubles, clinching the 
point for UF in both rounds.
“They’ve gotten better. 
They’ve improved and ma-
tured. They can handle the 
momentum shifts better now than they could earlier in the season,” Thornqvist said. “And they’re going to need to if we’re going to do any-thing in this event... We’re not going to be able to reach our goals if our freshmen don’t help us out.”Freshmen key as

Gators catcher Mike Zunino drilled two homers in No. 6 UF’s series-clinching win Sunday over No.

son he’s had five RBIs in a game.
After middling with the bat as a 
freshman, Zunino has stormed to a 
monster sophomore campaign, de-
spite the new aluminum. 
Although Zunino plays the most 
demanding position on the diamond, 
the catcher has started an astounding 
50 of UF’s 52 games. Zunino leads the team in nearly every statistical category, but his conference résumé is even more impressive.
He is third in the SEC in batting 
average (.367) and doubles (18). The sophomore is second in the confer -
ence in homers (12), slugging per -
centage (.654) and total bases (123), while leading the league in runs scored (55) and RBIs (51).   
“I can’t say enough about him,” 
O’Sullivan said. “He’s got leadership skills. He grinds out at-bats. He’s special behind the plate.”
The Gators host Jacksonville (32-
18, 18-9 Atlantic Sun) tonight at 7 be-fore wrapping up their regular sea-son with a three-game series against

Etc: UF shortstop Nolan Fontana

on Monday. The sophomore received the honors for the second time this 
season after collecting five hits, in-
cluding a game-tying two-run homer 
in Saturday’s win over Vanderbilt.BASEBALL , from page 14Claye, Horn, Miller and LaCaze

make excuses about that.”
On the women’s side, the 
Tigers coasted past the Gators 
by 30 points — needing only 
a 200-meter dash victory — as Florida failed to place in the top-three for the rest of the 
tournament. 
Earlier in the day, Florida’s 
men’s squad positioned itself 
at the top of the leaderboard with two meet records. Junior 
Will Claye captured the triple 
jump with a leap of 17.24m/56-6.75 (+2.2), and the 4x100 relay team sprinted to a blazing time 
of 38.53 seconds.
“I just went out there and 
did what we always do,” Claye 
said. “I felt good this morning when I woke up, and I was just really pumped all day. It’s just like practice out there...We’re ready to go back home, get a bit of training in and we’ll be 
ready for regionals and nation-
als.”
The women’s lone victory 
of the day came from fresh-
man Fawn Mill-er in the javelin. Her personal-best throw of 51.46m/168-10 
sealed the fourth 
consecutive SEC title for Flori-
da in the event.
“We went into that meet 
knowing that we could do the things that we did this week-end,” Holloway said. “Again, nobody on this coaching staff walked away saying, ‘Wow, I 
can’t believe we did that.’ We expected those girls to com-
pete that way and that’s why they’re at the University of Florida.”
Both the men’s and wom-
en’s teams were buoyed over the first three days of compe-tition with individual cham-
pionships. On Friday, junior 
Gray Horn took home his third consecutive SEC decathlon title, which was followed the next day with wins from Claye 
in the long jump and Gen-
evieve LaCaze in the women’s steeplechase.  
The Gators were going for 
their second men’s SEC Cham-pionship this season after win-ning the indoor meet in Febru-ary, while the women’s team was aiming at its second out-
door title in three years.

2 – The pass rush.
In 2009, the Gators ranked fifth in 
the country with 40 sacks. They ac-
cumulated 34 in each of the national 
championship seasons of 2006 and 
2008. But Florida had just 21 a year ago, tied for 86th in the nation. 
Muschamp must get good pro-
duction from highly-touted recruits 
Dominique Easley, Sharrif Floyd and 
Ronald Powell for the Gators pass rush to return to elite status.
3 – The secondary, minus Janoris 
Jenkins.
Muschamp said recently he’s 
happy with the guys remaining on 
the roster after Jenkins’ dismissal. 
But how will they line up, and can 
they be effective? Senior Moses Jen-
kins, junior Jeremy Brown and soph-
omore Cody Riggs all figure to play 
prominent roles. But the Gators will also likely 
have to depend on production from freshmen like De’Ante Saunders, who Muschamp said has impressed 
thus far.
4 – Who will emerge at running 
back?
The Gators situation at running 
back is muddled at best.  Jeff Demps and Chris Rainey are still there to catch swing passes out of the back-field and run stretch plays off tackle, 
but who will get the pivotal 3rd-and-
1’s? 
5 – The schedule.The Gators play three teams — 
Alabama, LSU and FSU — that are 
ranked in at least someone’s pre-season top 10, take it for what it’s worth. 
Two of those teams (Alabama, 
FSU) must come to The Swamp. But 
the Gators also face a daunting three-
game road trip with games at LSU, at Auburn and then against Georgia in 
Jacksonville.WATTS , from page 14
