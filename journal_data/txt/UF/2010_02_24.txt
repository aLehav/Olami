First day of SG election draws 5,289 voters
Voting will continue today from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
As the Unite Party and the Student Al-
liance party continued to campaign, 5,289
students cast their votes Tuesday on the
first day of Student Government elections.
Supervisor of Elections Ariana Alfonso
said about 300 more people voted than
on the first day last spring, probably be-
cause of the ballot questions concerning
the Reitz Union fee and the constitutional
amendment.
"This one has a more important refer-
endum, so that's why I think there was a
higher turnout on the first day," she said.Ben Cavataro, Student Alliance party
candidate for Student Body president,
said representatives of the party spoke
with many different students as they made
their way to the polls.
"A very large number have expressed
interest in the election," Cavataro said.
"I've never seen the Student Body so fired
up and ready to vote in an election."
Cavataro said he expects an even better
turnout of voters today.
Unite Party spokesman Ben Meyers said
the Unite Party hopes even more people
will vote today because the party wants
students to have an influence on their col-
leges and how the university's SG budgetis used.
Meyers said a good number of students
stopped to talk with Unite Party volun-
teers and expressed interest in the party's
platform.
"We were very pleased
with that," Meyers said.
"We're very pleased to
see so much involve-
ment.''
Crystal Dur-
ham, a pre-pharma-Cavataro cy sophomore, voted
for the first time during this election.
She said the prospect of an additional fee to
cover the expansion of the Reitz Union wasOne of the issues that drew her to the polls.
"I think it's important for everyone to
get involved with the decisions that get
made," Durham said. "It's our money they
use, so we should have a say."
Although there was a high turnout
at the polls, Alfonso said there have
been concerns about students double-
voting, and there was a report of sto-
len stickers from the Florida Gym.
She said that if students violate the rules
of the election, they will be held account-
able.
"Enough people double-voting could
definitely compromise the integrity of an
election, and that's why we take it so seri-
ously," Alfonso said.
SG elections continue today from 8 a.m.
to 8 p.m.
Ballot question
deals with labor
* THE REFERENDUM DEALS
WITH GATORS GEAR MADE
IN SWEATSHOPS.
By MATT HARRINGER
Alligator Staff Writer
This election season, students
have been sweating about execu-
tives, Senate seats and the Reitz
Union fee, but there's another
important question on the ballot:
Should UF support sweatshop la-
bor?
The UF Apparel Referendum
asks students if they support join-
ing the Workers Rights Consor-
tium to ensure licensed UF cloth-
ing is not made in sweatshops.
The Workers Rights Consor-
tium is composed of United Stu-
dents Against Sweatshops, a na-
tional network of student groups,
as well as university representa-
tives and labor unions.
The consortium, which in-
cludes 185 other universities
such as Harvard, Louisiana State
University, and the University of
Miami, works to detect and cor-
rect labor violations in factorieswhere merchandise is manufac-
tured.
Emily Flynn, president of UF
Amnesty International, said UF
is already a member of the Fair
Labor Association, which also
serves to detect violations of la-
bor rules.
Flynn said the Fair Labor As-
sociation has representatives
from corporations on its executive
board, meaning the corporations
are responsible for monitoring
themselves.
Student If the refer-Government endum passes,
UF could join
the Workers Rights Consortium
rather than acting as a member
of the Fair Labor Association, ac-
cording to Flynn.
Both the Workers Rights Con-
sortium and the Fair Labor Asso-
ciation charge universities up to
one percent of all apparel profits,
up to $50,000, according to a UF
Amnesty International press re-
lease.
Amnesty International col-
lected 500 signatures to place the

A 63-year-old man died after his car
crossed Southwest Archer Road and ran into
the stairs at Regency Oaks Apartments, 3230
SW Archer Road, early Tuesday morning.
Deleon Brooks was driving a Nissan
pickup truck when his car drove over the
median into westbound traffic and contin-

hitting a parked Jeep, a rock and a tree along
the way, according to Gainesville Police De-

the stairs, causing unspecified damage to
the stairs, Senn said.
Brooks was then taken to Shands at UF
but died during treatment, she said, adding
that the crash's cause is being investigated.
Leon Bradwell, leasing manager at Re-
gency Oaks, said repairs to the damaged
stairs were fixed Tuesday.

HAVE PASSED OUT FLIERS IN
APARTMENT COMPLEXES.
By ELIZABETH BEHRIMAN
Alligator Writer
The Student Government Elec-
tion Commission issued an order
Tuesday that urged members of the
Student Alliance party to stop hand-
ing out fliers and knocking on doors
in apartment complexes.
The fliers said, "The Unite Party
wants you to pay for their pet project
of an unnecessary expansion of the
Reitz Union. The Student Alliance
will not charge the students, and
instead will apply for state grants
to renovate the Reitz Union costing
students nothing."
Apartment complexes represent
non-solicitation zones, where SG
party members cannot campaign.
Unite Party President James Ty-
ger filed the complaint against the
members of the Student Alliance
party Tuesday morning.
He said a witness saw Ben Cava-
taro, the Student Alliance candidate
for Student Body president, knock-
ing on doors in the Gateway of
Gainesville apartment complex.
Tyger said the witness also found
fliers on the windshields of cars in
the complex."The rules are there for a reason,
and we need to abide by them," Ty-
ger said.
Andrew Brown, Election Com-
mission chairman, said knocking on
doors in non-solicitation zones rep-
resents an election code violation.
Brown said he reviewed the
complaint filed against the Student
Alliance party and found enough
evidence to issue the order.
"It was enough for me to know
that something was going on and
ask them to stop," Brown said.
Cavataro denies being in the
apartment complex Monday night
and said he has screenshots of his
Facebook page that show he was
home Monday.
He said he
Student was either chat-Government ting with friends
on Facebook or
asleep at the time he is accused of
campaigning in the complex.
"I think it's more than a little ri-
diculous, and obviously we're going
to have the evidence to back me up,"
Cavataro said.
He said the Student Alliance
party will continue campaigning
on campus tomorrow until the polls
lose.
"The Student Alliance is focus-
ing on the issues important to the
Student Body instead of obscure
election code complaints," Cavataro
said.

Speaker discusses Arab music
ByALLYSON FOX
Alligator Contributing Writer
Hicham Chami is mourning.
"Arabic music in its purist tradi-
tional form is dying," Chami said.
"Preserving it is a matter of histori-
cal significance."
Chami is the founder of the Ara-
besque Music Ensemble, a group of
professional musicians from around
the world who play traditional Ara-
bic music.
He spoke to about 15 people
Tuesday night in Larsen Hall to dis-
cuss the decline and preservation of
traditional Arabic music. The music
comes from oral tradition, he said.
He plays the qanun, a traditional
string instrument. Chami spent 10
years with his music professor and
never got a single sheet of music.
It was up to the student to pick
up on the music or not, Chami said.
"Over time, a lot gets lost," Cha-
mi said. "The oral tradition is enrich-
ing but also detrimental."
At world music festivals, only
about 4 percent of performances fea-
ture traditional Arabic music, Cha-
mi said, because in Arabic countries
there is not enough money being
spent on preserving cultural tradi-
tions, he said.
Globalization is also a factor con-
tributing to the decline of Arabic Hic
music. Fusion with other types of abmusic leads to the loss of the tradi-
tional Arabic feel. The music "gets the
swallowed when you put it with anc
something else," Chami said. co
The solution is recording and
documenting Arabic music and ed- spr
ucating people about it. Chami said

UF students help local high schoolers understand finance
By JULIA MCCLURE
Alligator Contributing Writer
When Mayanna Hemenway heard that
two UF students were visiting to teach her
high school financial planning class, she
said she pictured herself staring blankly,
her mind numbed by material she didn't
care about.
She thought wrong.
"It could definitely be useful later, es-
pecially if I do something with finance,"
she said.
Hemenway is just one high school
student who has learned about financial
literacy from Moneythink.org, a student
organization started at the University ofChicago. The newest chapter of the orga-
nization, American Investment Fellows,
began at UF this year with its first 10-week
curriculum for economics students at Bu-
chholz and Eastside high schools.
"Our goal is to make it interesting for
them," said Nirav Patel, the chapter's
president. "We feel like they get more
practical, hands-on experience than what
the books tell them."
Patel and fellow teacher and vice presi-
dent of the chapter John Colby visit Buch-
holz High School for an hour on Tuesdays
and Thursdays and Eastside High School
for three hours on Thursdays. The curricu-
lum focuses on teaching goal-setting, sav-
ing and budgeting, debt and credit, eco-"We feel like they get more prac-
tical, hands-on experience than

Michele Brothers, teacher and director
of the Academy of Finance at Buchholz,
said she has seen other college students
come into her classroom before, but it
wasn't like this.
"I thought this was a gift from above,"
she said.Patel started American Investment Fel-
lows at UF because he thought his teach-
ing offered Gainesville high school stu-
dents something different from what they
would get in the traditional high school
classroom.
"As college students, we can relate
to high school students more than some
teachers," Patel said.
Frances Vandiver, director of UF's P.K.
Yonge Developmental Research School,
said the program's curriculum provides
the students a way to see their future in a
different light.
"Engaging activities make all the differ-
ence in the world, " Vandiver said.
Renew Your Reitz campaign ads appear on library computers
Committee chair defends legality of ad
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
and CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Writers
Student Government candidates
are still campaigning and so is the
Reitz Union.
In addition to posters and fliers,
the Renew Your Reitz campaign has
spread to the Internet home pages
of computers in Smathers Libraries,
which has partnered with the Re-
new Your Reitz campaign.The Renew Your Reitz campaign
encourages students to vote for a
student fee funding the renovation
and expansion of the Reitz Union.
Ryan Moseley, the Renew Your
Reitz committee chair, said represen-
tatives have tried different means of
campaigning for the expansion and
renovation of the Reitz, including
table-top display ads.
He said setting up the home pag-
es on the computers in the libraries
was a way to get the message of the
campaign to more students."We're really not trying to be up
in everybody's face," Moseley said.
Students can view the Web site
when they log on to the computers,
or they can navigate away to another
page, Moseley said.
Reitz "You have the option
Union to learn about something
and read about some-
thing that's important on campus,
but on the same token, it's a more
passive kind of format," he said
He said the Renew Your Reitz
campaign is not an entity of an SGparty, so it is not subject to the same
rules and regulations as a normal SG
campaign.
Moseley said it is not illegal for
the Renew Your Reitz representa-
tives to campaign and encourage
students to vote in favor of the Reitz
Union fee on the SG ballot.
"We're just really trying to get
the message out there in any format
we can," Moseley said.
Adam Watts, a Ph.D. candidate
in the School of Natural Resources
and Environment, said he noticed
renewyourreitz.com was the Inter-
net home page on the computer heused in the Marston Science Library
Tuesday afternoon. He tried to alter
the home page on his computer but
was blocked from making changes.
Watts, who voted Tuesday in
Student Government elections and
is active in Graduate Assistants
United, said students shouldn't pay
for a building that will not be com-
pleted by the time they graduate.
"I really question why any stu-
dent should have to pay for the uni-
versity to renovate one of the build-
ings," Watts said, adding buildings
with labs and classrooms should be
renovated before the Reitz Union.-Semper Fi hosts
pull-up challenge
U THE SEMPER Fl SOCIETY'S EVENT PROMOTED
ROTC AND THE MARINE CORPS.
By MEG WAGNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
A crowd of students cheered on fellow Gator Matthew
Lake as he did more than two dozen pull-ups Tuesday
afternoon.
Lake, a political science sophomore and a member of
UF's Navy ROTC, did 28 pull-ups as part of an event or-
ganized by the Semper Fi Society.
The Semper Fi Society, a group for those interested in
the Marine Corps and ROTC, organized the event on Tur-
lington Plaza from 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. to give passers-by
the opportunity to test their upper-body strength by do-
ing pull-ups.
About 60 students turned out to take the challenge.
People who took the pull-up challenge, regardless of
success rate, were rewarded with a United States Marine
Corps T-shirt.
"If they give 100 percent effort, they get a free T-shirt,"
said Lt. Dennis Keller, organizer of the event and ROTC
staff member.
Members of the society also gave out information about
the Marine Corps and advice on how to stay healthy,
Keller said.
Keller said the goal of the event was to raise aware-
ness about and interest in the Marine Corps and physical
health in general.
"We just want to show what physical fitness and being
fit is all about," he said.

SPOTLIGHT ON THE SWAMP
Gators hope to grant wish
By KRISTEN BURKE
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF students can help make a wish
come true.
Gators for Wish Kids, a new cam-
pus organization, is raising money to
help grant wishes to children with life-
threatening illnesses through the Make-
A-Wish Foundation this semester. The
group will hold its first meeting at 8
p.m. Thursday in the Reitz Union Am-
phitheater.
Evan Georgiou, the organization's
president, was inspired to start the club
because of his father's involvement with
Make-a-Wish in other states.
"I originally looked to join a Make-A-
Wish club, but there wasn't one at UF,"
Georgiou said.
Georgiou has a big goal for the first
year: to grant one wish. According to
the Make-A-Wish Web site, the aver-
age wish is $7,362, but the cost can vary
greatly depending on the child chosen.The money raised by the club will be
donated to the Make-A-Wish Founda-
tion of Central and Northern Florida, he
said.
"I originally looked to join a
Make-A-Wish club, but there
wasn't one at UF."
Evan Georgiou

For Lindsay Watkins, a UF sopho-
more and vice president of Gators for
Wish Kids, one wish would be more
than good enough for the first year.
The club will work to raise money by
holding various fundraising activities
throughout the school year.
Georgiou said he has not planned any
specific events but hopes to have some
ideas in progress after the first meeting.

By ASHLEY HEMMY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Local artists and organizations will
attend an annual art forum today to
discuss low art-program funding and
their still-decreasing budgets.
The Gainesville/Alachua County
Cultural Affairs Board is holding its
second annual Arts Forum today at
the Thomas Center for the Arts at 5:30
p.m.
Art programs receive very little
county and state funding, and Alachua
County organizations are preparing for
more budget cuts this summer, said
Margie Roland, staff specialist of the
Division of Cultural Affairs of the De-
partment of Parks, Recreation and Cul-
tural Affairs.
The Gainesville Association for Cre-ative Arts offers programs to thousands
of elementary and secondary school
students.
The organization offers scholarships
to students in low-income families, said
executive director William Eyerly.
Eyerly added the state only funds 5
percent of the association's budget.
He will discuss
Around funding for an artsGainesville bus that will drive
students who do not
have transportation to after-school pro-
grams at today's forum.
"Transportation is the biggest factor
for stress," Eyerly said. "Even if kids
win scholarships, their parents can't
get them to class."
Eyerly plans to raise about $20,000
for the bus through donations collected
at performances the association hosts.

School right to take stand
against crude TV show
he University of California, San Diego has graced the
pages and airwaves of national media outlets quite
bit the past week. The school was in the news last week
when members of its Greek community sent out a Facebook in-
vitation to a "Compton Cookout."
The invitation asked attendees to dress ghetto in honor of
Black History Month. According to NBC.com, the invitation
read: "For those of you who are unfamiliar with ghetto chicks
-Ghetto chicks usually have gold teeth, start fights and drama,
and wear cheap clothes."
But the drama doesn't end there. The Associated Press re-
ported the administration stopped funding the school's 33 stu-
dent media outlets after a student-run TV channel, The Koala,
aired a segment making fun of black students' reactions.
Likewise, the organization's site says: "If history has shown
us anything, you need more black people at your party to have
enough black-on-black violence to actually justify the name
'Compton.' Shame on you. SHAME."
An administrator said the school canceled the show and will
reinstate funding when it "can be sure that such hateful content
can never be aired again on [their] student funded TV station,"
according to the AP article.
Now, we're all for freedom of speech, but the school was
right to step in and take a stance. It asked the remaining media
outlets to be patient until it can create a new policy. This isn't
the first time The Koala has gotten into trouble either -the AP
article reported in 2005 it aired a video of people having sex.
Although the fraternity men who planned the party were in
the wrong, The Koala was even more wrong to poke fun at stu-
dents' feelings about a serious issue. Its good to see the school
stand up for its students. If the Koala has a problem, it should
become independent.
Booty Booty Booty
W 're all used toAmerican Apparel's
advertising style.
Commercials seldom have
much clothing in them, and a
trip to the company's Web site
offers nipple sightings galore.
Even their child models often
pose in an arguably provoca-
tive manner.
But we pardon their ques-
tionable advertising because
the clothing is produced in
the U.S. by employees who
earn fair wages and benefits.
(It also helps that their pain-
fully trendy neon T-shirts are
our faves.)
But their latest cam-
paign, a "best bottom con-
test," has us wondering
where the promotion crosses
the line into exploitation.
For the contest, women (and
a few men) sent in photos
of their barely-covered der-
rieres, and visitors to the site
rated them on a scale of 1 to 5.
Almost 1,400 women submit-ted close-ups of their g-string-
or hot-short-clad butts, and
most of the photos show the

come the new "faces of Amer-
ican Apparel underwear and
intimates" (and we're sure
they're using the term "faces"
loosely).
But we suspect the contest
is less about recruitment and
more about luring people to
the site with the promise of
free images that are racier than
a Sports Illustrated swimsuit
cover.
This certainly isn't the
worst of American Apparel's
behavior -it pales in com-
parison to the constant sexist
advertising, its CEO's blatant
misogyny and the company's
refusal to support unioniza-
tion. But the butt campaign
is making us start to wonder
whether American Appar-
el's bad points outweigh the
good.

Votes are representative of agreement
he topic for today is voting. Or, more precisely, notvoting.
Voting holds a lot of implications. It is, at its ba-
sic core, an agreement to a set of terms. When people -
politicians, school board members, university trustees,
friends -grovels for votes, they are simply asking you to
agree with them. Matthew Christ
When Barack Obama beat John McCain in the last letters@a ligator org
presidential election, he won because a certain number of
people agreed with him more than they agreed with Mc-
Cain.
Some would like to complicate the simple process of
voting by equating a vote as something more than a sim-
ple agreement. This is bogus.
A vote is nothing more than an agreement between
the voter and the ideas of the person who's asking for the
vote.
As much as this country is associated with democracy,
not a lot of people living in it actually vote.
For instance, out of 49,679 people eligible to vote in the
UF Student Government elections last fall, only 10,469 ac-
tually voted. This was considered a record turnout, which
has the same level of irony as William Hung calling him-
self a singer.
All it takes to vote is a Gator 1 Card, and polling places
are located all over campus. In addition, the tidal mass of
green and blue fliers that have been annoyingly shoved at
you for the past two weeks all have specific polling infor-
mation listed for each college.
Despite all this, a lot of you won't vote.
Which is a pity. Because even if you don't vote, the
people who are elected still get to screw around with $14.4
million of your money.
So you didn't vote last semester or the semester before?Too bad, because the people who
were voted in, namely the Unite
Party, have both the power and the
will to increase your student fees
to pay for a $45 million renovation
and expansion to the Reitz Union
you'll never see. They also continue
to rip you off by spending $88,000 of
students' money on perks like free
BlackBerrys for themselves.
Again, your vote is a sign of your agreement.
Do you agree with the Student Alliance that class sizes
should be posted online, and that Gator 1 partnerships off
campus should be expanded? Do you agree with them
that SG-funded RecSports should implement an online
signup system to cut down on long lines, and that the SG
budget should be audited to ensure transparency? Do you
agree with them that open container ordinances should be
fought, and do you agree that SG perks should be cut from
the budget and the money saved should go back to the
students?
Most importantly, do you agree that $130 more per
year in fees is more than we can afford, and that SG needs
to look into every alternative before creating an expensive
new Reitz Union fee?
If you agree with the Student Alliance on these posi-
tions, then vote for them. If you don't agree with them,
then by all means vote for the Unite Party.
Either way, at least vote.

Letters to the Editor
Campaign should focus on real issues
Why I am running for Student Senate:
I begin by mentioning a ballot initiative
that has gotten little attention. In addition
to the two initiatives concerning the Re-
itz Union, there is a ballot initiative, sup-
ported by the Student Alliance, calling on
UF to join the Worker Rights Consortium.
The Worker Rights Consortium is a labor
rights organization that provides univer-
sities with means to ensure their apparel,
such as T-shirts, are produced in fair,
sweatshop-free conditions. There is, to my
knowledge, no organized opposition to
this proposal and I believe it will pass, but
the message will be much stronger if stu-
dents come out in large numbers to vote
for it.
The Student Alliance opposes the Re-
itz Union fee, as does Graduate Assistants
United, of which I am a proud member.
When I asked Reitz Union director Eddie
Daniels on Thursday how much the pro-
posed expansion (the second question on
the ballot) would cost, he said he did not
know, but that it would cost at least $70
million. I hope the Reitz Union will figure
out key details and come back to us when
they know exactly what is being proposed
and how much it will cost. At that time,
they will also be in a better position to ap-peal for funding from other sources, such
as the Capital Improvement Trust Fund.
I have been distressed by the ugly char-
acter this campaign has taken, including
Frank Walch's hateful letter to the editor
Monday, which the Alligator should be
ashamed of for having published. I do not
know who produced the fliers comparing
the Student Alliance to the Nazi party, but
whoever did so should face serious conse-
quences.
It is time to bring this campaign back
to the real issues. Today is the last day to
vote, and polls are open from 8 a.m. to 8
p.m. Polling locations are on our fliers and
can also be found at this Web site: http://

Aptitude tests are an unreliable method of gauging worth
or the job I'm going to have next year, I had to take acomputer skills test this week. There were ten ques-
tions, each one testing a random aspect of using com-
puters.
Which is bigger: 100 TB or 100 GB? (100 TB)
How do you make button selections when there isn't a
mouse? (Alt + the underlined letter)
What is the path for Notepad? (It's not in "Program
Files," it's in system32\notepad.exe)
I figured out most of the questions, but I was still offend-
ed that it called itself an aptitude test.
"This isn't a test of my aptitude," I realized and thought
to myself.
There's a difference between achievement tests and ap-
titude tests.
Achievement tests are a measure of what you have done;
aptitude tests are a measure of what you could do. School
quizzes are based on achievement, for instance, while intel-
ligence tests measure aptitude.
So this computer test claimed to figure out what my
potential was for learning software.
Now, let's say I never had to press a button without a
mouse. Does that really mean that I'm less able to learn
than somebody else?
The immediate answer is "no."
Go home and practice navigating around your desktop
using just the keyboard.Will Penman
letters@alligatororgThen if you ever take this test,
you'll be sure to score higher than
most people who haven't read this
article.
There, I just improved your com-
puter intelligence.
As I started thinking, I came to a
depressing realization: In society's
eyes, the older you get, the more
achievement is aptitude.
If I haven't investigated computers enough by now to
have discovered the Alt trick, I'm probably never going to
learn those kind of things.
On an academic level, ask yourself if you have the abil-
ity to get better grades.
"If I didn't get wasted so much," you say. Nope, so-
ciety says, you're wrong. Getting wasted every night is
part of who you are. You haven't gotten good grades, so
you can't.
If you think I'm exaggerating by calling it "society"
that thinks this way, let's look at one of the high-profile
post-graduate programs on campus.
Teach for America markets itself as bringing equality
to America by giving underachieving students better edu-
cational resources.
Of anyone, they'd be most open to the idea that apti-tude doesn't equal achievement, right?
On the teaching side, they are.
On the hiring side, they only want people who have
"demonstrated ability." That means that by the time you
finish college, if you haven't been a leader, they don't
think you're able to.
It's teaching aptitude they want, and they measure
that by your achievement.
All the rhetoric about achievement gaps and not judg-
ing the underprivileged -well, it's a different story when
there are paychecks and program prestige on the line.
Better learn the skills of leading now, because if you
wait for Teach for America, it'll be too late to do anythin
about it.
The difference between students and civilians is that
we have potential. Civilians only do different versions of
what they've already done.
Is this true? Not really. Einsteins who flunked out win
prizes.
Computer whiz kids who grew up with Macs can't
find Notepad on my computer aptitude test.
Aptitude isn't achievement, but get ready.
When you're in your senior year looking for jobs it's
really hard to think otherwise.

'Hairspray' star sings at local talent show
By VICTORIA ISRAELS
Alligator Contributing Writer
"Hairspray" movie star Nikki
Blonsky showed Gainesville she
really has talent Tuesday night.
Blonsky sang at Gainesville's
Really Got Talent Show at Buch-
holz High School, which raised
money for PALS, Partners in Ado-
lescent Lifestyle Support.
PALS conducts esteem-en-
hancing workshops to prevent
violence and provides free mental
health services to teenagers.
Twenty-six local middle and
high students danced, acted and
sung in front of an audience of
about 150 and five judges, one of
whom was Blonsky.
The panel of judges counted
for 50 percent of the vote, while
the audience cast ballots to take
up the other 50 percent.
"I am looking for self-satis-
faction in their performances,"
Blonsky said.
The winner won an opportu-
nity to meet Blonsky, backstage
passes to see Jesse McCartney in
Orlando and the opportunity to
meet with UF professors to dis-
cuss college performing arts ap-plications. The second- and third-
place winners won cash prizes
and a trophy.
Blonsky performed songs from
"Hairspray," including "Good
Morning Baltimore" and "You
Can't Stop the Beat" with dancers
from IndepenDance company.
Blonsky was 17 years old when
she filmed "Hairspray" and said
it was one of the best experiences
she has had.
"I am looking for self-
satisfaction in their perfor-
mances."
Nikki Blonsky
Hairspray star
"I would much rather kiss Tim
Tebow to be able to judge and
compare my kiss with Zac Efron,"
Blonsky joked in an interview
when asked how her kiss was
with co-star Zac Efron.
"I absolutely adore the PALS
program," Blonsky said. "I
wish they had been in my high
school."
The winners and amount of
money raised for PALS were not
available at press time.j

2 teens injured in Colorado middle school shooting
Lexie Shipman, age 13, right, wipes a tear away as her mother and sister console them-
selves after the shooting at Deer Creek Middle School in Littleton, Colo. Tuesday.* ONE MALE AND ONE FEMALE
WERE SHOT.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
LITTLETON, Colo. -A teacher tackled
a man armed with a high-powered rifle just
after two teenage students were shot Tues-
day at a suburban Denver middle school
that's just miles from Columbine High
School, the site of one of the nation's deadli-
est school shootings, authorities said.
One male and one female were shot at
about 3:30 p.m. outside Deer Creek
Middle School in Littleton, Jefferson
County Sheriff's office spokeswoman Jacki
Kelley said. Both students were taken to a
nearby hospital and were expected to sur-
vive.
Student Steven Seagraves said he was
about 10 feet away when an adult ap-
proached students and asked them: "Do you
guys go to this school?"
When the students said they did, he shot
them, Seagraves said.
Seventh-grade math teacher David Ben-
ke, a 6-foot-5 inch former college basketball
player who oversees the school's track team,
tackled the suspect as he was trying to re-load his weapon.
"He was trying to rack another round. He
couldn't get another round in before I got to
him so I grabbed him," Benke said, recalling
that he didn't have time to fear for his life.
Benke's wife said her husband called her
after the shooting.
"He said there was a shooting and that
he had to tackle the gunman," Sandra Benke
said. She said her husband was upset that
he couldn't reach the shooter before two
rounds were fired. "He said 'It was one of
my students."'
Authorities haven't released the victims'
names, but say they both had surgery Tues-
day evening.
Bus driver Steve Potter said he was about
to pull away from the school with a full bus
when he heard a loud bang that sounded
like an M-80 firecracker. Students screamed
when they spotted the man with a rifle, Pot-
ter told KMGH-TV.
"He looked like he was just kind of look-
ing around for someone to shoot," he said.
Potter said he saw Benke grab the sus-
pect so he and another man jumped on the
gunman and helped hold him until police
arrived.
The suspect's name hasn't been released,
but authorities say he's 32.
Student Alliance is in support of the question, Unite Party remains neutral
BALLOT, from page 1
referendum on the ballot, and Flynn said
the anti-sweatshop campaign has earned
attention on campus.
"I've had students pull out their sweat-
shirt tags and ask, 'Where did this come
from? Who made this?"' Flynn said.
Flynn met with Patricia Telles-Irvin,
vice president for student affairs.
Flynn said Telles-Irvin is receptive tojoining the Workers Rights Consortium
and is preparing a report on the proposal.
Ben Cavataro, the Student Alliance par-
ty candidate for Student Body president,
said if elected, his party would work to
persuade the university administration to
join the Workers Rights Consortium.
Cavataro said joining the consortium
is common sense because it will cost the
same as being a member of the Fair Labor
Association and won't change the price of
apparel."I've had students pull out their
sweatshirt tags and ask, 'Where
did this come from? Who made
this?"'
Emily Flynn
president of UF Amnesty International
"It will give UF students the peace of
mind that Gator apparel is made sweat-
shop free," Cavataro said.The Unite Party is staying neutral on
the referendum to allow students to make
up their own minds, said Ben Meyers, the
Unite Party spokesman.
If the referendum passes, the Unite
Party would also support bringing the is-
sue to the attention of UF administration,
Meyers said.
"We revolve around student opinion,"
Meyers said. "Our job is to represent the
students."

Easy ways to add more fruits
and vegetables to your diet
January resolutions may be over, but it is never too late to work on your permanent healthy-eating
goals, one at a time. Most of us need to eat more fruits and vegetables to meet nutrition recommenda-
tions. Your first goal can be increasing the number of fruits and vegetables you consume daily
Strive to have five or more servings per day Two servings are equal to one cup, or a portion about
the size of your fist. You'll be well on your way to five servings if you serve a cup or more on each
plate. Or use fruit as snacks; each individual fruit is a serving.
Adding more fruits and vegetables to your daily intake will increase your energy Nutrients found
in fresh produce can help prevent heart disease and some cancers.
Here are some ways to make eating fruits and vegetables a habit for life:
A Visit one of the local farmers' markets to purchase fresh produce from local growers.
A Check out local "U-Pick" farms, where you can harvest your own fruit. Blueberry season is
coming in May Freezing fruits gives you a selection of locally-grown fruits even when they are no
longer in season.
A For a quick, healthy breakfast, grab a piece of fruit as you walk out of the house in the morn-
ing, or mix dry fruit with some whole-grain cereal to carry with you. Mix fruit into yogurt for a
pre-workout snack.
A Fill your dinner plate half-full of vegetables. Like fruits, vegetables add vitamins, fiber, color
and "phyto," or plant, chemicals to your diet.
A Make a smoothie with fresh or frozen fruits, and freeze the leftovers for a refreshing snack
cup.
March is National Nutrition Month (sponsored by the American Dietetic Association) and the
theme this year is "Nutrition from the Ground Up." Start your day with fruit and add additional fruits
and vegetables to your intake each day, for a more energetic and healthier you. Visit a registered dieti-
tian at the Student Health Care Center to help you set personalized nutrition goals.
Informationprovided by the Student Health Care CenterWhat will you bring back
from spring break?
Maybe a glowing tan or a cool new tat-
too?
If your spring break escapades include
sexual activity, you could bring back some-
thing without even knowing it: a sexually
transmitted infection (STI).
Chlamydia is just one STI out there.
The number of chlamydia infections re-
ported to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention has been on the rise for the
past 20 years.
Why?
Because most people infected with chla-
mydia have no symptoms.
Men and women can get chlamydia from
a sexual partner after engaging in vagi-
nal, oral or anal sex, and then pass it on to
someone else without a clue.
If left untreated, chlamydia can lead to
pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic pelvic
pain and even fertility problems in women.
Men sometimes can be left sterile.
Obviously, chlamydia is not the only STI
out there. And spring break sex isn't the
only way to contract an STI.
Everyone who is sexually active is at risk
for acquiring and transmitting an STI.Susan Ryals, an advanced registered
nurse practitioner who works at the Uni-
versity of Florida's Student Health Care
Center, says the most common STIs she
sees in UF students are human papillo-
mavirus (HPV), chlamydia, gonorrhea and
genital herpes.
The SHCC offers testing for sexually
transmitted infection(STIs),along with
counseling and treat-
STI ment.
Awareness Fortunately, treat-
ment for chlamydia is
relatively simple.
Condoms used with every act of sexual
intercourse will reduce the risk of acquir-
ing an STI.
According to the CDC, the most cer-
tain way to avoid getting chlamydia or any
other STI is to not have sex, or to have sex
only with someone who is not infected and
has sex with no one but you.
Be smart. Be proactive. Don't just
Google it. Get tested.

Health Q&A
Provided by Gatorfell
f l:ealth N;
Why should I be concerned about skin cancer?
Skin cancer is the most common type of can-
cer in the United States, which can affect anyone
regardless of skin color. About one million Ameri-
cans get it each year. Considering that we live in
Florida, always remember to use sunscreen so
that you are protected. The Student Health Care
Center also has regular mole screenings. To learn
more or to sign up for the next mole screening,
call Special Clinics at 392-1161 x4259. GatorWell
Health Promotion Services also distributes free
sunscreen (SPF 30)yogurt and some fruit as you head out the door.
How do I know I am eating the right portion
sizes?
Many may not know this! The secret to portion
sizes is in the palm of your hand. Usually, your fist
represents the serving sizes of cereal, vegetables
and a cup of milk or juice. Your open palm rep-
resents the amount of meat and snacks that you
should eat.
Are dietary supplements better than food?
All the necessary vitamins and minerals you
need are found in the foods you eat, if you obtain a
balanced diet. If you are concerned that you aren't
getting all the nutrients you need, a nutritionist at
the Student Health Care Center would be a great
resource for you.
What is the difference between sunblock and Where is a good place to find recipes?
sunscreen?
The main difference between the two is that
sunblock will give you more protection from the
sun as opposed to sunscreen. This occurs because
sunblock is a lotion that blocks out the sun's harm-
ful rays from your skin while sunscreen only blocks
out the redness producing rays from the sun. Keep
in mind that people with all skin types need sun-
screen.
intion
Why is breakfast so important?
A healthy breakfast is extremely important.
It refbels your body and gives you the necessary
energy in order to start the day, which ultimately
allows you to perform better at school or work.
Typically, a well balanced breakfast consists of a
variety of foods including fruits and vegetables,
grains, dairy, and protein. Try grabbing a cup ofRecipes are a great way to find healthy foods
that are quick and easy The GatorWell cookbook
is a great source for nutritional meals which can be
found at The Student Health Care Center or just
Google "Gator Grub Cookbook". Some of the reci-
pes include delicious meals like lazy lasagna, spin-
ach dip, and vegetarian chili. You can also search
for recipes online. Try entering "healthy recipes"
or "nutritious recipes" into a search engine.
What are some healthy snacks to eat "on the
go?"
It is hard to always find time to cook or even eat
a decent meal. Here are some healthy snacks you
can eat when you are in a rush, whether it is for
breakfast or a snack. Remember that snacks high
in fiber and protein will keep you feeling full for a
longer period of time.
Trail mix -Yogurt -Chopped Fruit -String Cheese
-Granola Bars -Peanut butter sandwiches -Nuts -
Whole grain cereals -Carrots -Bananas and ApplesWhat are the benefits of dark chocolate?
Dark chocolate has antioxidants that aren't
found in other types of chocolate. Studies have
shown that it can lower blood pressure. Remember,
moderation is the key since chocolate has a high
concentration of sugar, fat, and calories.
What are the effects of caffeine on the body?
Caffeine is a mild stimulant that can increase
feelings of energy, but the effects on health are less
clear. Caffeine's strongest effects are felt for about
an hour after consumption, and it lasts for about
4-6 hours in the body If consumed excessively, caf-
feine can lead to problems such as poor sleep, upset
stomach, headaches, and difficulty concentrating.
Remember, moderation is the key If you are look-
ing for more energy, try healthier ways like eating
fresh fruits and vegetables, drinking water, exercis-
ing regularly, and getting enough sleep.
How do I treat food poisoning?
In most cases, the best treatment for food poi-
soning is for you to get plenty of rest and fluids.
Drinking plenty of fluids will prevent dehydra-
tion. Keep in mind that food poisoning ranges from
a mild to a more severe form. If symptoms become
more severe, be sure to see a doctor immediately.
Can energy drinks really boost my energy?
Energy drinks can boost your energy, but only
temporarily. You may feel a boost of energy for
only a few hours and then crash. Try natural ways
to boost your energy by getting adequate sleep,
exercising, and staying hydrated with water.

What are the health benefits of yoga?
Those who practice yoga perform various re-laxation techniques which can lower blood pres-
sure as well as heart and breathing rates. Students
who practice yoga tend to report lower levels of
stress, better sleep, and higher levels of energy.
Do you have any tips on how to make exercise
more fun?
There are various ways that you can have more
fun while exercising. Dancing is one way to spice
up your mundane exercise routine. Try bicycling,
basketball, or swimming. Attending one of the
many group fitness classes at either the Student
Recreation Center or Southwest Recreation Center
is also a good option. The best part is you will be
burning plenty of calories without actually notic-
ing it.
Are there any benefits to exercising in the morning?
Morning exercise can reduce stress levels and
boost energy as well as helping you set the pace
for the day Morning exercisers also tend to stick
to their exercise regime more. In addition, your
exercise is out the way before the rest of the day's
distractions. The major key to remember is that
no matter what time it is, (morning, afternoon, or
night), exercise has its benefits.
What are the benefits of group exercise?
Exercising in a group setting can give you
more motivation to exercise. It makes the experi-
ence more fun and less stressful. There are group
fitness classes at both the Student Recreation Cen-
ter (Racquet Club) and Southwest Recreation Cen-
ter. The Spring 2010 schedule for each location can
be found online.
Is it better to eat before or after exercise?
Eating before or after exercising are both great
strategies for performance, fitness, and health, but
the decision lies in how you eat since it depends

on your duration and rigor of exercise. Remember
that eating is very important because it fuels your
muscles before you exercise or refuiels them after
you exercise.
Why is it important to have a good breathing pat-
tern during exercise?
The most important thing you need to keep
in mind when exercising is to breathe evenly and
regularly Since your muscles are working hard,
breathing serves as the main source of fuel for
them. Try not to hold your breath or breathe in
short bursts because your muscles won't get as
much fuel as they need.
Being a busy student sometimes makes it hard to
go outside the home to exercise. Are there any
fun and effective ways to exercise in the home?
You can try one of the newly developed ex-
ercise video games such as "Wii Fit" or "Dance
Dance Revolution". This involves exercising in a
fun way and you may not even realize that you are
exercising. You can use a workout video or pur-
chase inexpensive equipment such as a door-frame
pull-up bar, small weights, a yoga mat, or an inflat-
able exercise ball.
Sexual H ealth
Can I get tested for HIV without health insurance?
GatorWell Health Promotion Services offers
free confidential HIV testing by appointment only
44 The A1achuaCoun HealthDear-also administrates free, confidential HIV testing
on Wednesdays 9am-12pm.
I heard that I could get free condoms on campus.
Is that true?
Yes! You can find free condoms at any of the
GatorWell locations. GatorWell is located at the
Student Health Care Center on the 3rd floor (we
will be moving shortly to 3190 Radio Road just
past Lakeside). Other locations include Jennings
and the Springs Residential Complex. You can also
find free condoms at any of the GatorWell Health
Huts which is located in various locations around
campus several times per week.
What are some benefits of Gardasil, the HPV
vaccine?
Gardasil is a vaccine that prevents women from
getting cervical cancer and the four most common
HPV types; two cause genital warts and two are
the precursors to cervical cancer. The shot is taken
in three increments and is considered ideal if taken
before engaging in any type of sexual activity, but
you can still take it afterwards. However, the vac-
cine will not cure an existing infection.
What are some reasons why condoms break?
Condoms should not break if they are used
correctly. Condoms usually break if they aren't put
on properly, if the wrong kind of lubricant is used
with them, or if they are past the expiration date.
Sometimes storage can be an issue as well. There-
fore, always make sure to be cautious and check the
ment (334-7960, ext. 79621) and the Student
Health Care Center (392-1161) are great resources
to get tested. At the health department, there is a E ntal Health
sliding scale fee system, and there is an optional I
$20 fee for anonymous testing. The Student Health How many hours of sleep are enough?
Care Center has a $30 fee. A rapid test is available For most adults, seven to eight hours of sleep
with results in 30 minutes, but may require con- is sufficient for academic productivity. Remember,
firmatory testing. Planned Parenthood (377-088 1) that it is important to get enough sleep because ithelps you perform better the following day, reduce
stress, and boost your immune system. For more
information, visit the sleep section at HealthyGa-
tors.hhp.ufl.edu.
Can I get some tips on how to better manage
my time?
Time management is extremely important in
order to increase productivity and decrease stress
levels. Some effective ways of doing this includes:
being organized, using a day planner, prioritizing
your tasks, avoiding overload, practice effective
study techniques, and always have a goal or plan
in mind. Also you can always talk to one of our
time management specialists at GatorWell Health
Promotion Services.
I've been feeling really depressed lately. Where
can I go to talk to someone?
The Mental Health Services Department at the
Student Health Care Center and the UF Counsel-
ing Center at Peabody Hall are valuable resources.
Some of the services include individual and group
counseling as well as biofeedback. These services
can help you address personal problems in addition
to school related issues. These two great resources
are joining together to become the Counseling &
Wellness Center.
Can I get some tips on how to multitask effec-
tively?
Multitasking usually decreases productivity.
Typically, you get more work done if you focus on
one specific task at a time, which can also reduce
your stress level. Some tips to help you complete
your tasks effectively is to find your balance among
all your tasks, always prioritize and organize in
advance, and know when it is appropriate to focus
your attention on a particular task.I want to get more involved on campus, how can
I find out more about student organizations?
Being more involved on campus is a great way
to meet other students. If you are experiencing
feelings of loneliness and isolation, social interac-
tion from student organizations may lead to re-
duced stress levels and help you feel more a part of
campus life. There are over 900 student organiza-
tions here on campus including academic, cultural,
service and leadership, and much more. Therefore,
I am sure that there is an organization out there
for you. If not, you can always start one. For more
information, you should visit http://www.union.
ufl.edu/involvement to find an organization that
may interest you.
What are the benefits of meditation?
There are several types of meditation. For ex-
ample, some focus on clearing the mind of every-
thing, repeating a saying or "mantra", or focusing
on a particular object or location. Meditation is a
good way to reduce stress levels by leading to a
deeper level of relaxation. It can decrease your re-
spiratory rate, heart rate, and muscle tension.
Alcohol, Tobacco
& Other Drugs
Is it safer to smoke hookah than cigarettes?
It is a myth that smoking hookah or a water
pipe is safer than cigarettes. It is just as dangerous.
Actually, hookah smokers may inhale more tobacco
than cigarette smokers in one sitting due to the
massive volumes of smoke they inhale. A typical
hookah session lasts about 45 minutes, which is
much longer than a cigarette break. You get more
nicotine from hookah, which leads to increased
risk of addiction. Remember that hookah smoke
contains high concentrations of toxins that can
lead to health complications such as lung cancer

and heart disease. In addition to health complica-
tions from the tobacco smoke in hookah, you can
increase your risk of infection by sharing the hoo-
kah mouthpiece with others. Infections can range
from the common cold to something more serious
such as herpes.
What do I do if I think my friend has alcohol poi-
soning?
Alcohol poisoning is a serious consequence of
consuming large amounts of alcohol in a short pe-
riod of time. It is extremely important to know the
signs and symptoms since it can happen to anyone.
A person's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) can
continue to rise even after passing out or sleeping.
It is important not to assume that the person will
be fine by going to sleep. Some of the signs and
symptoms of alcohol poisoning include:
-Mental confusion, stupor, coma, or the person
cannot be roused
-Vomiting
-Seizures
-Slow breathing (fewer than eight breaths per
minute)
-Irregular breathing (10 seconds or more be-
tween breaths)
-Hypothermia (low body temperature), bluish
skin color, paleness
-Call 911 if someone is showing these signs
and don't leave the person alone!
lat at niht-Y.
I get out of class late at night. What are some
tips to stay safe?
You should always try to be aware of your sur-
roundings. For example, you should avoid the use
of earphones. Walk briskly but confidently, and
always keep your car keys ready to avoid digging
through your bag to find them. Another alterna-
tive to walking is calling 392-SNAP for a ride any-
where on campus. Always remember to stay safe
by wearing something reflective so you are readily
seen by others. You can take a self-defense class incase you are faced with a dangerous situation. For
more information on how to stay safe on campus,
go to the Healthy Gators 2010 website.
I plan on traveling abroad for the break. What
safety precautions should I take?
If you are going to travel abroad, plan ahead.
You want to make sure you have the necessary
documentation and make sure you have the immu-
nizations needed for the place that you are visiting.
You can visit the UF travel clinic for more health
information on immunizations. Call 392-1161 ext.
4312 to set up an appointment.
Flu Prevention 1
I got the flu shot. Can I still catch the flu?
The flu shot cannot give you the flu. Instead, it
reduces your chances of getting the illness. Oth-
er ways to reduce your chances are to wash your
hands regularly, cover your cough, and as much
possible, avoid close contact with other individuals
who may be sick. Remember that it is important to
get vaccinated every year.
How do I know the difference between a cold and
the flu?
It can be hard to tell the difference between a
cold and the flu since both have similar symptoms,
but flu symptoms are worse than a cold. You usu-
ally have higher fevers with flu that can last 3-4
days, and the flu affects your whole body You may
feel extreme fatigue, achy muscles, dry cough and
sore throat.
I seem to get sick often. Can I improve my resis-
tance to colds & flu?
There are various ways to boost your immune
system. Believe it or not, getting a fill night's rest
can help your immunity In addition, maintain
healthy habits such as staying hydrated, managing
your stress, engaging in regular physical activity,
and eating a variety of nutritious foods like fruits
and vegetables.Don't Let the Sun Ruin Your Fun
Gainesville's cold and wet winter has
made basking in the sun a priority for many
UF students this spring break. Before you hit
the beach, learn how to protect yourself from
painful and harmful sunburn.
First and foremost, protect yourself from
the sun by using some common sense. The sun
is the most intense from 10am to 4pm, so if
you plan outside activities, plan them for the
early morning or late afternoon.
Choose a sunscreen with a Sun Protection
Factor (SPF) of 30 and higher. SPF only refers
to protection against UVB rays, so read the
sunscreen label to ensure that you are protected
against both UVA and UVB rays. Avobenzone,
zinc oxide and titanium are all ingredients that
provide protection against harmful UVA rays.
Apply the sunscreen at least 30 minutes prior
to sun exposure and reapply frequently If you
are particularly sensitive to the sun, wear sun-
protective clothing, a hat and sunglasses to
protect your eyes, which also can suffer cumu-
lative damage from the sun.
There are many prescription and over-the-
counter products which can make you more
susceptible to sunburn. Even ingredients in
certain sunscreens can cause photosensitivity
in some people. Avoid sunscreens that contain
benzophenones (dioxybenzone and oxyben-
zone), para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), salicy-
lates and cinnamates.
Prescription and over-the-counter medi-
cations such as birth control (tablets, ring or
patch) antibiotics commonly prescribed for
acne or urinary tract infections, non-steroidal
pain relievers (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen
(Advil@) or naproxen (Aleve@), cholesterol
lowering agents ("statins") and other medica-
tions may enhance sun sensitivity in certain
individuals.Use extra precautions if you are taking
any of these medications. Ask your health-
care provider or pharmacist when you are
prescribed medication if it will increase your
sensitivity to the sun.
If prevention fails and you become sun-
burned, it is important to treat the burn prop-
erly. The extent of the burn will not be appar-
ent until 12-24 hours after sun exposure. Keep
the skin cool and moist by applying cool com-
presses. Avoid tight clothing and apply mois-
turizer or aloe gel to hydrate the skin. Avoid
any topical products which contain numbing
agents (i.e. lidocaine, benzocaine, or dibucaine)
Skin because you could
P t become sensitized
action (i.e., allergic) to these
products.
Do NOT apply ointments or butter to a
burn as this will likely cause further damage
to the skin.
Drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydra-
tion. Pain relievers such as acetaminophen
(Tylenol@), ibuprofen (Advil@), and naproxen
(Aleve®) can help with the discomfort and fe-
ver that may accompany sunburn. Antilista-
mines such as cetirizine (Zyrtec®), loratidine
(Claritin®) or diphenhydramine (Benadryl®)
can help with the itchiness that often accom-
panies sunburn.
Many of these medicines are available for
the University of Florida community at the
UF's Student Health Care Center pharmacy,
and often they cost significantly less than at
other retailers. If your skin is blistered, leave
the blisters intact. Seek medical attention if
you experience a fever higher than 1020 F,
chills, dizziness or nausea

SMART Goals with RecSports
By Dana Brown and Jessica Gates
Most people have goals, but when
asked to state them they are often vague.
Beginning a workout routine is the first
step towards success, the next step is cre-
ating goals.
Use the S.M.A.R.T. acronym to help
you create effective goals.
A good goal should inspire you to go
someplace you want to go, and provide
some indication when you have arrived. A
good goal is a destination -not ajourney.
Remember to reward yourself once you
have achieved your goal or at milestones
along the way.
The Department of Recreational
Sports offers many different programs
and services to assist you in reaching your
fitness goals.
These programs and services include
the four areas of Florida Fitness: Group
Fitness, Strength & Conditioning, Per-
sonal Training and the Personal Training
& Assessment Center.
A great way to implement the SMART
goal system is to visit the Personal Train-
ing & Assessment Center for a FREE fit-
ness assessment. The results you receive
will provide you with a foundation for de-
signing your own workout program.
Take advantage of the many different
events around campus including the 2010
Midnight Fun Run co-hosted by Healthy
Gators 2010 and Rec Sports on the night
of April 21, 2010.
Set your SMART goals today to begin
training for the 2010 Midnight Fun Run!
To find out more information on how
to improve your fitness level visit recs-
ports.ufl.edu.Specific -Your goalsneed to be specific. For
example, if you want to
increase your running speed,
set a goal of running a 5k in a
specified amount of time. (See
the Spring 20 10 edition of RecS-
ports: The Magazine for tips on
how to successfully train for the
Midnight Fun Run 5k race.)
Measurable -Your
goals need to be mea-
surable, allowing you
to know when you have reached
them and also to provide a way
of measuring your progress.
Attainable -Make
sure that the goal you
set is within reach
at your current situation. If
you are training for your first
5k, you should allow a mini-
mum of six weeks to prepare.
Realistic -Your goals
need to be realistic for
the amount of time you
allow. For example, it is not re-
alistic to be able to bench press
2501b in one month of training if
you are currently lifting 901b.
Timely -Set a date to
achieve your goal with
steps along the way.1Copy'g hied ' 0

Florida was up against more than
just La Salle on Tuesday.
The Gators (2-0) fought through the
cold, rain and sleet in Philadelphia to
beat the Explorers 15-5 on Temple's

Leaving the sun and warm tempera-

squad had to pay keen attention to the
little things to get the victory.
"When you play in this type ofweather, the key is making good passes
and concentrating on your fundamen-
tals," O'Leary said. "Despite the inclem-
ent weather, they did a great job of ad-

Bruns leads UF with six goals in two games
LACROSSE, frompage 22
with four assists, while Cochran
dished out two.
So far, Bruns owns the season
lead for goals (six) and assists
(eight).
O'Leary said her players did
a good job of maintaining pos-
session of the ball throughout
the game, and they improved on
some of her concerns entering the
match.
"There was much more com-
munication," she said. "After the
Jacksonville game, we focused on
making sure that we were going
to play a better team defense, and
they were able to improve in that
part of their game. It was good to
see."
She said the team reacted well
to playing in an unfamiliar place
on an unfamiliar field and even
had to deal with another unusual
field component -the turf.
The field at Temple was com-
pletely Astro Turf, and O'Leary
said the Gators had only played
on Field Turf and the grass surface
at Donald R. Dizney Stadium.
Even with the adjustments it
needed to make, UF remained in
control of the game.
The Gators played the role of
the attackers in the match, taking
23 shots on goal to the Explorers'
10.
UF also challenged La Salle for
the 19 available ground balls but
picked up only eight.
Dashiell scored the first goal

giving UF the early lead.
The squad quickly landed two
more in the net, and it held the
Explorers scoreless until 21:50 left
in the first half.
UF closed out the half scoring
three unanswered goals, and at
the break it led 8-3.
The second half proved to be
more of the same for the Gators
who continued their streak of
three unanswered goals with an-
other five to start the final period.
The junior forward has easily been the Gators
most -and arguably only -consistent player after
logging two years of constant ups and downs.
He is averaging career highs in points (11.7), re-
bounds (seven), assists (2.4), field-goal percentage
(50.2), free-throw percentage (66.1), three-point per-
centage (36.5), buzzer-beaters (two), guys who wish
they were him (5,472) and girls who wish they wereO'Leary said because her team
has seven scoring threats, it was
hard to shut down any one or two
of those players, which placed the
Gators in position to score as of-
ten as they did.
"That's what our goal is on the
offensive end," she said. "To have
every single one of those seven
players that are on the field as
threats. When we can accomplish
that, like we did today, great
things will happen."

With Parsons' natural talent, he should be a
3,000-3,000 guy at best.
It was only fitting that he would lead the charge
with a 19-point, eight-rebound performance as UF
pulled away from Tennessee in the second half.
It's safe to say no one expected the Gators to be
playing for their 10th SEC win with three games left
on the schedule. They have overachieved in every
sense of the word.
And I mean that as a compliment.

and grabbed eight rebounds. "It doesn't really matter
what happened the last two years, the last six games. To-
night was the only game that mattered."
It seemed as if UF's shooting woes from beyond the arc
would continue Tuesday night, as it hit just 1 of 9 before
halftime, but Walker and Parsons nailed four huge threes
that turned a tight game into a blowout.
Walker hit three shots from beyond the arc in less than
two minutes, followed by a three-pointer by Chandler
Parsons that pushed the Gators' lead to 20 to cap off a
23-6 run by UF.
"That's what he's done for us all year. He steps up
when the game's on the line," Parsons said of Walker.
"He's an impact player who really stepped up and made
some shots for us today."
With its outside shot not falling in the first half, UF got
into the lane and scored 26 of its 37 points in the paint be-
fore intermission, attacking the Vols' big men and getting
Wayne Chism and Brian Williams into foul trouble.
Chism, who dominated the Gators
in the teams' first matchup, only played
15 minutes and fouled out with 4:02 re-
maining, allowing UF to have its ways down low.Basketball "That was huge," Parsons said. "We
definitely wanted to get the ball inside.
We felt like we had an advantage in there."
Coming off a career-high 22 points against Ole Miss
on Saturday, junior center Vernon Macklin avoided the
letdown UF coach Billy Donovan feared, scoring 13 points
and grabbing 10 rebounds.
Junior power forward Alex Tyus added eight points
and eight boards, and the Gators frontcourt redeemed it-
self for its poor showing against the Volunteers in their
61-60 loss in Knoxville, Tenn., on Jan. 31.
Florida got off to a hot start, jumping out to an 11-4
lead and ending the first half on a 7-0 run to tie the game
at 37.
The Gators kept it close despite a huge disparity in the
teams' outside shooting. The Volunteers hit six threes be-
fore halftime while UF hit just one of its nine attempts -a
bank shot from the top of the key by Kenny Boynton.
"We can win games without even shooting well," Par-
sons said. "And you saw tonight, when we put it all to-
gether -when we played defense and shoot the ball well
-what we can do to teams."

Freshmen have another chance to impress against UCF
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator org
The Gators' freshmen are most comfort-
able in the spotlight and on the field.
If their name is not one of the nine listed
on UF coach Kevin O'Sullivan's lineup card,
then the newcomers start to feel a little anx-
ious and uncomfortable.
Freshman pitcher Brian Johnson didn't
know what to do when he was yanked out
of Saturday's game against USF in the sixth
inning.
"I don't think he's ever been taken out of
I1Ia game," O'Sullivan said. "He didn't know
how to react when I asked for the ball."
If their play in the opening series was any
indication, these first-year players shouldn't
have a problem staying on the field.
No. 5 Florida (3-0) will call upon another
freshman, Hudson Randall, to be its starting
pitcher in tonight's matchup against UCF
(3-0) at 6:30 in McKethan Stadium.
However, Randall would not be the first
member of UF's No. 1 recruiting class to
shine.
Freshmen Austin Maddox and Kamm
Washington hit home runs in their first
games as Gators. Mike Zunino alreadyknows what it feels like to hit a walk-off
single, and Johnson finished his first start
without letting up an earned run.
"That's why we recruit them," O'Sullivan
said. "Good players make coaches look
good -it's as simple as that. There's no real
magic formula."
Through the first weekend, the freshmen
are making their coach look very good.
Maddox hit a home run in each of his first
two games and had two more stolen from
him by USF center fielder Ryan Lockwood.
Those plays kept Maddox from labeling his
first series a complete success.
"It was exciting to put on the uniform for
the first time," Maddox said. "I thought I
swung the bat pretty good, but I just didn't
have good luck this weekend."
Pitchers have already started to throw
differently to him, as he did not see a fast-
ball after his first at-bat of the series on Fri-
day, when he hit a home run to right field.
He shouldn't have a problem making the
necessary adjustments at the plate because
the freshmen have shown they are capableof adapting on the fly.
"We changed up the lineup a little bit,
and the next thing you know, you're ask-
ing freshmen who have never sat before to
get loose in the seventh inning," O'Sullivan
said.
Washington, who was put in that situa-
tion Sunday, admitted to having some trou-
ble coming off the bench late in the game.
"When you are pinch-hitting, it's a little
bit tougher because you sit in the dugout
and it's just mentally harder to come in to
the game," Washington said.
But that wasn't a problem for Zunino,
who sat out the final game of the series un-
til he was called upon to come in late and
eventually hit the walk-off single to beat the
Bulls.
None of these accomplishments sur-
prised O'Sullivan, though.
"They are certainly capable," he said.
"You never quite know if they are going to
deliver when the lights go on and when it
really matters, but they did nothing differ-
ent than what they've been doing."

Lendl sisters
lead Gators to
first-place finish
By KELSIE HOECHERL
Alligator Writer
It was a sister act for the Florida women's golf team Tues-
day in its final round at the Central District Invitational.
Sophomore Marika Lendl and sister, freshman Isabelle,
finished the tournament in a tie for first place, both with a
three-round score of 212, four-under par in the Gators' first
place finish with a total of 857 (290-281-286, -7)
Isabelle, however, claimed the tournament title after she
beat her older sister in a scorecard playoff. The winner was
determined from the golfer's score on the last nine holes.
"It was so fun to watch them [the Lendl sisters] all day,"
UF coach Jan Dowling said. "It was an incredible scene. I
don't think it has been done before where two sisters tie for
first in a college event. .they were both so composed down
the stretch, they deserve it.
"They've worked hard and it was really great to see them
handle some pressure."
The duo battled to the end, making even the scorecard
playoff intense. Marika went into her final nine with a lower
score than her sister, shooting one-under.
Isabelle struggled on the back nine after
back-to-back bogeys but redeemed herself
with three birdies and an eagle to cap off
the round. Isabelle wound up topping her
sister by shooting a three-under final nine.
As a squad, UF finished seven strokes
under par and 29 strokes ahead of the sec-
Isabelle Lendl ond-place finisher, TCU.
"This week was truly a team effort,"
Dowling said. "Everyone played well, we had everyone in
the top 20, which is a testament to our team depth. That is
what a team requires to be successful down the stretch. We
are obviously very excited about this win, it was a great win
and it is going to motivate us to continue working hard for
the later parts of the spring season."
All around, Florida had strong performances from its
golfers.
Freshman Mia Piccio scored a personal best with two
career-low rounds and the highest finish of her career, a tie
for fourth. Piccio finished three rounds carding 217 (72-73-
72, +1).
Sophomore Evan Jensen also notched a new personal
best, finishing 54 holes with a total score of 218 (71-72-75,
+2). Jensen beat her previous best of 221, which she shot at
the 2008 Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge. Jensen
finished in a tie for seventh.
Junior Jessica Yadloczky rounded out the Gators' lineup,
finishing in 18th. She had her lowest score Tuesday and to-
taled 223 (76-74-73, +7) in three rounds.UF sweeps FSU, extends streak
The Gators were a perfect 9-0

The No. 9 UF women's ten-
nis team defeated No. 15 FSU on
Tuesday, improving its record to
8-2 and furthering two impres-
sive streaks.
With the win, Florida in-
creased its all-time series lead
in the rivalry to 50-1, and it was
the Gators' 84th-straight regular-

UF swept the six singles and

toughest challenges of the season
this weekend.
Florida will host No. 6 Duke,

trated the most emotional win
against the Seminoles, winning
four-straight games to come back
from a 6-4 deficit and defeat Amy
Sargeant and Francesca Segarelli
of FSU on Court 2.
"Frankly, I thought we played
well in one doubles match (No. 3
pair Allie Will and Marrit Boon-
stra), but we played terrible in
the other two," Thornqvist said.
"The thing we preach the most
is to play together, and I didn't
think we did that until the last
two games of the set."
"I feel like we're playing
good tennis, and we have
to make sure we don't
make it too much of a big
deal."
Roland Thornqvist
UF women's tennis coach
Revzina added that nerves
played a role in her doubles
pair's slow start, but she was able
to turn things around before the
'Noles took a commanding lead
in the match.
"Anastasia did a good job re-
covering though -she looked
terrible in the first set," Thorn-
qvist said. "I could tell she had
no feel, but then she started to
get better mentally and landed a
couple of nice forehands."
Embree (No. 22) had the best
overall outing of the day and
cruised to victory (6-2, 6-1) in her
singles match against Lauren Mc-
Creless.
"[Embreel played excellent
tennis," Thornqvist said. "She
did a great job staying balanced
in her singles match and really
played fabulous tennis through-
out the day."
The UF men's tennis team will
also get a shot at its rival, as the

Florida draws inspiration, toughness from local 8-year-old
0 THE GATORS WILL FACE VANDERBILT TONIGHT
IN NASHVILLE.
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@alligator org
Before the Gators take the floor at Memorial Gym tonight
at 7 to take on Vanderbilt, they'll be reminded by an 8-year-
old about toughness.
Catriona "Cat" Chennell was diagnosed when she was 4
with primary pulmonary hypertension -a deficiency of the
heart and lungs where her heart wasn't receiving enough
oxygen. She spent 345 days at Shands Medical Center wait-
ing for a heart and lung transplant.
On Sunday, she attended her first-ever Gators sporting
event: the women's basketball game against UGA.
With Cat in mind in every team huddle, her plea for a
win didn't fall on deaf ears as the Gators held on to beat No.
20 Georgia 64-57."It was a lot of fun," Cat said. "It was really a dream come
true for me."
The Gators (14-13, 7-7 Southeastern Conference) will
look to answer Cat's call again when they face off against
the Commodores in Nashville.
Jence Rhoads led VU (19-8, 8-6 SEC) with 14 points in a
66-58 win at the O'Connell Center on Feb. 4.
"They whooped our butt on our home
court," UF guard Jordan Jones said. "We
got revenge on UGA, and now it's time to
get it for Vandy, too."
Women's The Commodores don't necessar-
Basketball ily boast size, like Tennessee and Georgia
have, but they rely on tenacity and their
ability to shoot the ball.
"They're not very big, so it'll be a battle of the less-than-
six-foot kids on Wednesday," UF coach Amanda Butler
said.
Vanderbilt ranks 15th in the country in field goal per-
centage (48.5) and leads the SEC from three-point range in
league play.Last time out against VU, the Gators were effective scor-
ing in the paint (32 points), but never got their outside shots
going -a 23-percent clip from beyond the arc. If UF hopes
to keep any glimmer of a tournament bid alive, a win in
Nashville is crucial.
"We have a team with five seniors on it, so are they aware
that there are implications for every win and loss? Absolute-
ly," Butler said. "It's not something we as a coaching staff
have to talk about that much."
While Butler may not be stressing the chances of mak-
ing the tournament with her team, it's clear she thought the
team needed a spark. It was Butler who introduced Cat to
the team.
The two parties have become so close in the past few
days, Cat and her father, Justin, made the trip to the airport
to see the team off to play Vanderbilt tonight.
"I don't know if we win against UGA if we don't have
Cat there for our inspiration," Jones said. "She's our new
little good luck charm, so we're going to keep in close con-
tact."

Constitution Amendments for the 2010 Spring Ballot
Fellow members of the Gator Nation:
As you may know, Student Government elections are upon us. While you may or may not vote in these elections, it is important that you know that this election is a bit different than most. Every 10
years, our student body Constitution demands that a Commission convene to draft revisions to our constitution, and this process has occurred over the last 14 months. The results of the
Commission's work will be on the ballot during this election and you will have the opportunity to accept or reject the changes. I write to you today, as the Chairman of this Commission, to encourage
you to vote in favor of these changes.
The 20 members of the Commission are proposing many important changes to our Constitution. The process was not a political process, but one designed to ensure that this important document
holds our elected leaders accountable, that this document is updated and current, and that our student body has access to our student courts and student leaders. Our changes lower the threshold
for impeachment for Student Senators that have been accused of official misconduct. We lowered the threshold to submit constitutional initiatives to the Student Supreme Court. In light of Florida
Board of Governors Resolution 08-23, we ensured the continued viability and presence of the former office of Honor Court Chancellor by creating a presidentially appointed position.
The 20 members of this Commission span the entire spectrum of our Gator Nation community. From Majority and Minority party senators, the Interim Dean of Students, the current Senate President
Pro-Tem, the current Chief Justice of the Student Body Supreme Court, the Director of Student Activities and Involvement, to many involved undergraduate, graduate, and law students. The result is
a comprehensive and united effort to help ensure that our student government, like our student body, remains unrivaled in reputation, both today and into the future. I would encourage you to review
the proposed changes and email me directly to discuss any questions you may have. We hope you will take the time to vote to pass this new Constitution.
Sincerely,
David M. Kerner
