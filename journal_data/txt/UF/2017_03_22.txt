In order to create a welcoming 
environment for black students at UF, a new Living Learning Com-munity will be available beginning Summer B. 
A residential space for black 
students was a key suggestion from 
the Black Student Affairs Taskforce, a group of students who make rec-
ommendations for how to improve black students’ experiences at UF, wrote Mary Jordan, the assistant 
director of housing for residential 
education, in an email. UF Housing received the recommendation in 
Summer 2016 and has been work-
ing on creating the space since.
Residential curriculum and ac-
tivities are still being determined, Jordan said. Possible plans for those in the program include tak-ing trips to local black-owned busi-nesses, discussions with faculty 
and staff from Black Affairs and 
African American Studies and col-laboration with Hispanic Heritage 
Month.  
“What is most important to me 
in any residential curriculum is 
that the voices of the residents sub-stantially inform the community’s initiatives and events,” she said. 
The Black Cultural Living Learn-
ing Community will be housed in Graham Hall and will have the capacity to serve 200 students, Jordan said. Currently 45 students 
have expressed interest in the LLC 
on their housing application. 
“Our year one vision is to have 
about 100 students participating in the community,” she said. 
Jordan said any student can live in the space, and those interested in social justice and current events will ﬁ  nd it useful. There is no ad-ditional fee for students in the pro-gram. 
“Because this LLC is a partner-
ship with Black Affairs, students can expect to see their values re-ﬂ  ected in the residential experience as well, particularly: multicultural-ism, inclusion and dialogue,” she said.
 UF to oﬀ  er ‘Living Learning Community’ for black students

Titi Aynaw went from running 
around barefoot to lacing up army 
boots to slipping on high-heels.
The 5-foot-9 inch Israeli was 
born in an Ethiopian small town that had no cars, no TV and no phones. 
After she was orphaned at 9, she 
lived with her aunt for three years before moving to Israel with her grandparents. She joined the Israeli army at 18 and commanded 300 sol-diers by the time she was 20. Five months later she was 
crowned Miss Israel 2013. 
Speaking to a crowd of about 60 
at UF on Tuesday, Aynaw said she still doesn’t understand the stark contrasts of her life.  
“It doesn’t make sense,” she 
said. “It doesn’t come together. It feels crazy.”  
The 25-year-
old told her unex-pected life story 
in Turlington 
Hall, as part of 
an event hosted by This Is Israel, 
a UF student 
group, and the Jewish National 
Fund, which is an international or-ganization that helps Jews.
Eyal Abadi, the treasurer and 
founder of This is Israel, said the or-
ganization hosted the event to share 
Aynaw’s story.
“We brought her to tell everyone 
on campus that in Israel dreams do come true,” the UF computer sci-
ence freshman said.

The owners of the motorcycles 
Smith Meyers is accused of drunk-
enly knocking over while on Spring Break are pre-pared to take le-gal action against the incoming UF Student Body president.
Mark Holland-
sworth and Ran-dy Fischer, mem-bers of the Axeman Professional Fireﬁ  ghters Motorcycle Club, woke up on March 7 in Key West while on vacation to ﬁ  nd a police ofﬁ  cer’s business card on their scratched-up Harley-Davidsons motorcycles.
Frustrated with the damage done to their motorcycles — which will cost at least $6,000 for fresh coats of paint and other repairs — the men said they just want Mey-ers to pay for the damages.
“In the motorcycle community, 
motorcycles are off limit,” Fisch-er said. “Mr. Meyers is kind of a marked man right now.”
Multiple re-
quests for com-
ment to Meyers’ 
attorney were not returned.
Fischer said he has hired a law-
yer, who will bill Meyers for the damages. If Meyers doesn’t pay up, Fischer said he plans to take him to court. During the incident, Bikers seeking repair

‘Pity for the Wild: Three 
Grotesques’ by Tennessee 
Williams
The UF School of Theatre and Dance presents a “grotesque version” of Tennessee Williams’ “Pity for the Wild: Three Grotesques” until Sunday. This production features three works by the playwright, who is often considered one of America’s 
finest. The works, “The Chalky 
White Substance,” “Something Unspoken” and “The Gnädiges Fräulein,” reintroduce audienc-es to Williams as a playwright of the grotesque, where unfor-gettable characters struggle for equilibrium in worlds interde-pendent of horror and laughter. 
These plays are quite unlike the 
Williams most people are ac-customed to. Directed by Tiza Garland and Ralf Remshardt, tickets for the production are $18 for the general public, $15 for seniors, UF faculty and staff and $13 for UF students. Tickets are available through 
the University Box Office. More 
information is available at arts.ufl.edu.
University Galleries presents: 
‘Currents 2017’University Galleries and student organization H.O.T. Clay at UF are pleased to present “Currents 
2017 Perception: Color and 
Content” in the Gary R. Libby Gallery from now through April 19. There will be an opening reception March 30 from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. “Currents” is an annual national juried exhi-bition co-juried by Linda Lopez and Katie Parker. “Perception: 
Color and Content” is themati-
cally focused on the idea of how perception of color can change the way content is perceived. This important annual exhibi-tion selects jurors and address-es contemporary themes in ce-ramic art. “Currents 2017” will expand the educational experi-ence for students within UF’s 
School of Art + Art History and 
engage the public with color and content within contempo-rary ceramic art. The exhibition and opening reception are free and open to the public.
Our Fake Democracy

Democracy Matters UF is orga-nizing an event called Our Fake Democracy where there will be a panel discussion on non-parti-san democratic values and insti-tutions that are under attack and are currently eroding in con-temporary times. These institu-
tions include voting rights, ob-
structionism and big money in politics. The panel will include a student, professor and com-munity activist. Afterward there will be action tables where par-ticipants can move and act on the democratic institutions the panel discussed. People can call 
or write their representatives, 
sign petitions and join other po-litical organizations.
Graduate Student Appreciation 
Week, April 3 to April 7The UF Graduate School is ex-cited to announce UF’s sec-ond annual Graduate Student 
Appreciation Week. This 
weeklong event is designed to celebrate the accomplish-ments and contributions of more than 12,000 UF graduate students. The week will show-case the work of UF’s gradu-ate students and highlight the services they provide to the 
university and the community 
through research, teaching and mentoring via events like Graduate Student Research Day, Graduate Wellness Day with the Counseling & Wellness Center, professional development op-portunities through the Career Resource Center, a student or-
ganization showcase, ice cream 
social and a closing event at the University House before the Orange and Blue Debut Spring game. To learn more, please vis-it graduateschool.ufl.edu/gsaw.
A Doorway to the Divine: Islamic 
Bodies and the Sufi Saints as 
Connecting the Living to the 
DeadA historian of the Islamic world, France and medicine from McMaster University will give a free public lecture April 6 at 5:30 p.m. in Smathers Library, Room 100. Ellen Amster will discuss the role of the bodies of saints in healing the living in precolonial Morocco. For Muslim pilgrims visiting the tombs of the saints, these holy 
bodies offered cures by linking 
heaven and earth. These tra-ditions and beliefs were chal-lenged by French colonialism and notions of science in the late 19th century and early 20th century. This event is the sev-enth in an eight-part series called Death: Confronting the 
Great Divide, during which in-
ternationally renowned scholars and filmmakers explore unique cultural and historical confron-tations with death. This event is free and open to the public and includes time afterward for questions and discussion. 
Transcription experiment at UF
UF’s Advanced Computing and Information Systems lab needs participants for a transcrip-tion, or digitization, experi-ment. Participants will be paid $10 per hour and can complete one or two hours of the experi-ment. Basic usage of a com-
puter mouse and keyboard are 
required. Because of payment regulations, only permanent residents or U.S. citizens are al-lowed to participate. Dates and hours are flexible. Sign up by emailing ialzuru@ufl.edu or by visiting humain.acis.ufl.edu.

was always on the back of Aynaw’s 
mind, she said. 
When she left the military and 
went back to Ethiopia to see her 
mother’s grave, her best friend Noa 
Grafi, signed Aynaw up to audition 
for Miss Israel. After showing up 
wearing flat shoes, a T-shirt and no 
makeup, Aynaw was not sure she’d 
win.
“When I was in the army, I for -
got to be a woman,” she said.
But she became the first Ethio -pian to win the contest. She then 
traveled around the world modeling 
and met former President Barack 
Obama in 2013. She said she was 
one of the first black women on Is -
raeli billboards.
Aynaw then started a foun -
dation to help kids in her Israeli 
hometown, named Project Titi. She 
now helps 66 kids by keeping them busy after school with classes that 
include jewelry making, basketball 
and math so they stay out of trou -
ble.
“I became a role model for my 
community kids,” she said.
Jonah Stein, a UF biochemistry 
senior, attended Aynaw’s speech 
and said he admired her mission to 
relieve poverty there.
“Where she came from and 
where she’s going is very inspir -
ing,” Stein said.

old UF student personnel and 
higher education graduate student, 
said she’s been working to develop 
the community. She said as a black 
woman she took an interest in the 
project.
Matthews said she wants to de -
velop a sustainable community for 
all students to help them thrive at 
UF.
“We don’t want students to feel 
like they don’t have a place,” she 
said. “We’re not trying to replace 
the (Institute of Black Culture) by 
any means, but we definitely want 
to offer an open space for deep and 
meaningful dialogue.”

rellenbogen@alligator.orgHollandsworth and Fischer were 
sleeping at Hollandsworth’s rent -
ed house, and their motorcycles 
were parked nearby, Fischer said. 
Meyers knocked down Fisch -
er’s 2009 Harley-Davidson Fat 
Bob, which Fischer said retails for 
about $13,000, according to an ar -
rest report filed by the Key West 
Police Department. Meyers also  
pushed Hollandsworth’s 2007 
Harley-Davidson Street Glide, 
which Hollandsworth said retails 
for $30,000, into Fischer’s motor -
cycle.
Fischer said the damages to 
his motorcycle will cost between 
$3,000 to $5,000, and Holland -
sworth said the damages to his 
will cost at least $3,000.
“It’s so disrespectful to do what he did,” Fischer said. 
Fischer, 57, from Urbana, 
Ohio, said he has visited Key West 
more than 60 times, and this was 
the first time he brought his mo -
torcycle.
He’s been an associate mem -
ber of the Axeman motorcycle 
club for about six years and owns 
a motorcycle and car dealership in 
Ohio, he said. 
The biker club the two men are 
a part of is a charitable club made 
up mostly of firefighters, although 
only Hollandsworth served as a 
firefighter.
Fischer said the Axeman 
wouldn’t attempt to get revenge 
on Meyers, but other motorcycle 
clubs in Florida might.
Hollandsworth, a retired fire -
fighter and one of the oldest mem -
bers of Axeman, said he plans to represent himself during Meyers’ 
arraignment, the date of which 
hasn’t been set.
“That’s just not a cool thing to 
be doing,” the 61-year-old from 
Trenton, Michigan, said. 
When Hollandsworth learned 
Meyers was preparing to become 
UF’s Student Body president, he 
said he was surprised a person 
of that stature would damage his 
bike. He said Meyers should step 
down and apologize to the uni -
versity. Fisher agreed and said 
he was shocked that UF didn’t re -
move him from the position.
“I’m sure he’s very embar -
rassed,” Hollandsworth said. “I 
hope for his sake that he learned 
a lesson.”

IT’S THE MAIN FACTOR IN 
FLORIDA’S DECREASING 
ORANGE PRODUCTION.
By Meg Schloss
Alligator Contributing Writer 
A devastating citrus disease has 
reached the Florida Panhandle, and 
UF researchers are working to fight 
it.
Carrie Harmon, the director of 
UF’s Plant Diagnostic Center, said 
citrus greening, a deadly disease 
caused by bacteria spread by the Asian citrus psyllid insect, reached 
the Panhandle in December, which 
was the only area in Florida with -
out the disease. UF researchers are 
looking for a cure, but none is cur -
rently available.
In Alachua County, the dis -
ease hasn’t been a major issue be -
cause farmers typically grow small 
amounts of cold-tolerant citrus.
But farmers in the Panhandle, 
where the disease has been ob -
served in Franklin County, also 
grow cold-tolerant citrus. 
The disease is the main factor in Florida’s declining orange produc -
tion, which has decreased by 60 
percent in the last six years, said 
Dean Gabriel, a professor in the UF 
Department of Plant Pathology.
Harmon said the disease in the 
Panhandle shows that citrus green -
ing has spread farther than experts 
were aware of. 
“The real kicker with this dis -
ease is that the plants can be affect -
ed for a year or two or more before 
we see symptoms,” she said. 
Harmon said her lab at the di -
agnostic center is one of the few in Florida which tests for citrus green -
ing. Her program is focusing on ear -
ly detection of the disease, she said. 
UF researchers are working to 
create a spray or injection to ter -
minate the disease in infected and 
uninfected trees, she said. 
“Experimentally, there are some 
things that show promise but noth -
ing that is labeled, registered and 
able to be used right now for the 
citrus in Florida,” she said.  
Citrus greening can also be 
found in California, Arizona and 
Texas, Gabriel said. If the disease continues, Florida 
farmers can expect another 50-per -
cent drop in production every five 
years, he said. 
Although few farmers in North 
Central Florida grow citrus, War -
ren Henderson has spent 20 years 
growing the plants in Hawthorne, 
Florida. He said his own farm 
hasn’t seen any effects of the dis -
ease, but it could show up in the 
future. 
“It’s a matter of time that we 
begin to have the same problems,” 
he said. UF researchers working to stop deadly citrus disease

Following a string of hateful in -
cidents at UF over the past three 
months, the Student Senate on Tues -
day passed a resolution condemning 
acts of racism and anti-semitism on 
campus.
It also passed a resolution sup -
porting First Amendment protec -tions. Both passed unanimously. 
Resolutions state the Senate’s 
stance on issues but do not require 
action.
Sen. Wallace Mazon (Impact, Dis -
trict E) who was a co-author to the 
resolution condemning hate speech 
held up a copy of a comic that ap -
peared in the Alligator on Tuesday, 
which depicted UF President Kent 
Fuchs’ automated voice message condemning whatever a caller takes 
issue with.
“I’m not available right now, but 
if you’re a student calling to com -
plain about something, then I con -
demn that thing,” the message read.
Mazon said the comic explains 
a lot of students’ frustrations about 
acts of hate speech on campus and 
the university’s lack of action.
This is the reason why he and the other authors wanted to write the 
resolution. 
“Our job as senators is to ques -
tion the status quo,” he said. 
In addition, the Senate unani -
mously passed a resolution honor -
ing the lives of two UF students who 
died in a car accident during Spring 
Break and unanimously passed rec -
ommendations for committee seats. 
Sen. Elizabeth Wilson (Impact, Health and Human Performance) 
who authored the bill honoring the 
lives of Caroline Alfano and Nicole 
Scherten said she is a member of the 
same sorority to which Alfano be -
longed, Kappa Kappa Gamma. 
Also during Senate, $1,050 was 
passed for the UF Asian Graduate 
Student Organization, and $440 was 
passed for the UF Student Informa -
tion Security Team. Senate passes resolution condemning hate speech at UF

A new app is aiming to make safety a 
priority in meeting someone online, by 
checking users’ names against a list of sex 
offenders.
Taken Mate, a new identity verification 
app, launched in February and is currently hosting a competition between UF student 
organizations to earn downloads, said Jus-
tin Parnell, who created the app.
Using social media accounts, users link 
anything from their Facebook accounts to 
LinkedIn as a way to get connected with 
others through the app, Parnell said. 
He said user’s information can only 
be changed on the original social media platforms, and everyone’s names are run through a sex-offender database to prevent 
registered sex offenders from using the app.
The purpose was to create safer first in-
teractions for people who meet online, he 
said. 
Since the app’s launch, Parnell and the 
company’s marketing director, Michael Marasco, have visited Florida college cam-puses to promote it and receive feedback 
from students.
 “The internet has the undesired conse-
quence that people can misrepresent them-
selves,” Marasco said. “We want to prevent that from happening.” 
The winner of the competition will get 
a $1,000 donation toward its philanthropy 
from the organization. 
Users, who can also use the app through 
an Instagram account, will be able to use 
it through Twitter as well by the end of 
March, Parnell said. The linked accounts 
just show others that users have profiles on 
those social media sites.
“It’s to show you what I look like on so-
cial media to make sure I am who I’m say-
ing I am,” Parnell said.
Noah Amico, a UF architecture sopho-
more, said he often uses Craigslist to pur-
chase and sell items. He said he hasn’t 
had a bad experience, but knows meeting strangers can be risky. 
“At times the app would be helpful just 
to know who you are actually meeting up 
with,” the 20-year-old said. New app vets users with

Twenty-five students learned 
Monday that their portraits will 
be joining UF’s Hall of Fame in the Reitz Union.
New inductees for the Hall 
of Fame, which honors notable student leaders, include the cur-rent Black Student Union presi-dent, the Asian American Student Union president and the current 
Student Body vice president. At 
least 12 inductees, about half, are members of Florida Blue Key, a UF honor society comprised of 
students with long careers in Stu-
dent Government and other stu-
dent organizations. Kevin Doan, a 21-year-old UF 
real estate graduate student and former Student Body vice presi-
dent, said he was shaking when 
he found out he received the award.
“It’s kind of like a thank you 
from the university, and it makes 
it seem worth it,” Doan said.
A committee of nine UF faculty members and students chose the final recipients from a pool of 87 
applicants, said Myra Morgan, the committee chairperson and director of external relations for 
student affairs. Five of the nine 
members of the committee have 
been inducted into the Hall of Fame, including Will Atkins, the interim executive director of Mul-ticultural & Diversity Affairs, and John Hooker, the development of-ficer for the Institute of Food and Agriculture Sciences.
Morgan said the committee 
looked at the differences appli-
cants have made in the organiza-
tions they got involved with.
“One of the things we ask is 
for people to put what they ac-
complished, not just a running 
list of organizations they belong 
to,” she said.

When a group of frustrated students 
walked into her office on Tuesday asking 
for Smith Meyers’ resignation, UF’s Dean of Students gave a stern response: No.
A segment of UF’s Student Body has 
called for the incoming UF Student Body president’s resignation following Meyers’ 
arrest for allegedly knocking over motor-
cycles while drunk over Spring Break in Key West.
But Dean of Students Jen Day Shaw said 
UF refused to interfere in Student Govern-ment matters, and that students’ misde-meanor charges aren’t examined by the Student Conduct Committee or the Dean of Students Office. 
“We’re not going to tell Student Govern-
ment what to do,” she said.
Anthony Rojas, who organized a protest 
on March 14 demanding Meyers’ resigna-tion, scheduled the meeting with Day Shaw. He said he invited UF President Kent Fuchs to the meeting, but Fuchs didn’t respond to 
his’ request. Rojas, 21, said he wanted to speak direct-
ly to UF administration about the incident.
“We just want to make sure that the 
highest officials of the University of Florida 
are aware of the concerns of the Student Body,” the UF political science junior said. 
While Day Shaw said she couldn’t com-
ment on Meyers’ arrest, she said only ex-treme off-campus arrests like child pornog-raphy, violent drug dealing and attempted murder would be considered for code viola-tion.
When students asked the administration 
if it would remove a student from an elect-ed position, Day Shaw said that UF would not interfere. Meyers is set to take office in April, where he will represent UF’s roughly 52,000 students, and take his place as the only student member of the UF Board of Trustees.
Rojas said he was surprised the adminis-
tration wouldn’t address the incident. 
“Student Government answers to no 
one,” he said.

THE FACILITY STILL NEEDS 
ABOUT $300,000 IN DONATIONS.
By Molly Vossler
Alligator Staff Writer
The North Central Florida YMCA received 
the funds needed to pull itself out of debt.
In December the Gainesville-based facility 
announced it would be closing its doors due 
to mounting debt, which spurred hundreds 
of community members to donate a total of 
$1.2 million to save the YMCA, located at 
5201 NW 34th Blvd.
“We have almost 400 donors. There was 
an absolutely huge effort, and people were just really moved by the cause,” said John 
Bonacci, the CEO of North Central Florida’s 
YMCA.
Although the facility will remain open in-
definitely, it still needs about $300,000 more 
for renovations, Bonacci said.
“Now the real work begins,” Bonacci said. 
“There’s a lot of work that has to be done to 
satisfy the courts, to rebuild the management staff, to try and get some fresh blood on the board of directors, the facility renovations — 
the list just goes on and on.”
Allison Nick, whose family has been a 
part of the YMCA since her birth, was sur-
prised and upset when it was announced in 
December that it would be closing.
Nick, 25, goes to the YMCA almost every-
day to use the gym and take yoga and other wellness classes. When she was little, she 
practiced gymnastics and learned to swim at 
the YMCA.
“It’s been in the community for so long,” 
Nick said. “The thought that future genera-
tions wouldn’t be able to use it was devas-
tating.”
At the beginning of the year, Nick joined 
other YMCA members to fundraise and ulti-mately save the place.
“We were so overjoyed to hear it would be 
staying open permanently,” she said. “When 
you care about something, and you’re willing 
to fight for it, it can be saved.”

I have become more aware of a family trait 
whenever I or my brother return home after a month or two of being away: We really en-joy reminiscing. All four of us enjoy reach-
ing into our past experiences for a good story 
that makes our audience crumble with laughter. 
We can do this for hours. And it matters little whether the story has been told or retold, as long as it is told with enthusiasm and it enter-tains. There are times when we become so lost in this activity that we don’t leave the dinner table until an hour or two after we had ﬁ  nished eating.
It is no wonder to me that I love to read and write ﬁ  c-
tion — the love of good stories was taught to me from birth, though I failed to realize it until recently. I have found this is not unique to me or my family, but that most every person I befriend also enjoys a good story. Certainly, 
not everyone enjoys pleasure reading, but those who don’t 
read watch Netﬂ  ix, or go to the movies, where stories are made real, in a sense. A nameless and strange magic over-takes us when we are gripped and absorbed in a good book or movie, where the events being told to us seem as real, as our own existence, or even more so depending on the story. There is oftentimes, for me, a feeling of wonder or despair or love that lodges itself in my psyche, which seems 
to be lacking in my everyday experience. In other words, 
the world or universe of a good story produces longing, in 
that it appears to be richer and fuller than our own. 
Yet I do not place the ultimate value of stories on the 
emotions they produce in us, or the strengthening of 
our empathy, or the degree to which we can escape in its world, though these are certainly ingredients. Stories and storytelling are valuable, indeed essential, because they capture, reveal and explore deep human truths. To me, this is the mark of a good story: the degree to which a story communicates 
to me my existential condition as a human. 
I have thus far been discussing ﬁ  ction and 
fantasy, which, I imagine, are the ﬁ  rst impres-
sions of the average person when the word “story” arises in conversation. But this is a mis-leading and misguided idea, for we not only tell ﬁ  ctional stories, but also real ones. And of these 
real stories, they do not simply consist in past personal experiences, but we tell of the universe’s origins, of why we exist, of where we are going. I think of not only the cre-
ation story of “Genesis,” but also of Neil DeGrasse Tyson’s 
hit show “Cosmos.” Both atheists and theists tell stories about the universe; It is the way we make sense of the world. The central difference between these stories and ﬁ  c-tion is that we believe the former to be true and to be a true account of reality.
This is why I am a Christian — I see the biblical story 
as being the one that accounts for reality as we know it, 
in all of its complexity, beauty and brokenness. Not only 
that, I understand the biblical story — creation, fall, salva-
tion, redemption — as being a true one, which gives me a 
large vision of the world, in that I am a small part of this larger story.
This is also why I am an English major, since I am pri-
marily a truth-seeking human being who sees literature (stories) as a primary and essential vessel for communi-cating deep human truths. I study English because I want to understand life, myself and others. Though I still ap-
preciate stories like my family’s, those who simply make 
me laugh and keep me around the kitchen table for a few 
hours.
Scott Stinson is a UF English sophomore. His column 
appears on Wednesdays.The importance of delving into fantasy and ﬁ  ctionIt’s that time of the semester that makes or breaks us. Fi-nal projects are piling up, midterm grades are in — ﬁ  nal exams around the corner. It’s that lull before the storm; just a few weeks from ﬁ  nals, just a few weeks from the ultimate deadlines, just a few weeks before we can’t drop 
a class, just a few weeks before we register for classes. We were pulled into a sense of false security over Spring Break, but now it’s time to kick ourselves into action.
During times like this, it’s easy to get swept away. Students will boast about their all-nighters, practically 
competing to see who worked harder, who got less sleep, who skipped more meals. It’s easy to get caught up in that game.  Who spent more time in the library? Who stayed up later? Who wins? Who gets that title of “most dedicated student”? Sometimes, listening to people talk about their third all-night-er of the week, you can feel like you’re not doing enough. 
We’re not saying that as students we shouldn’t study, far 
from it. We understand the importance of hard work, of giv-ing up a weekend vacation to study for physics, of staying up a little later to perfect that paper, of skipping a night out to attend a Study Edge session. This is all important.
We’re just trying to say that you, dear readers, and your 
health — physical, emotional and mental — is important, too.
Sometimes, yes, it is necessary to pull a late night, to sur-
vive on less sleep than normal, but we shouldn’t be glamor-izing those behaviors and holding them up as hallmarks of a good student. There comes a point where we need to recog-nize that, yes, it is okay to sleep. Yes, it’s okay to take a break to get some food. Yes, it’s okay to put away your work for a moment and go on YouTube and watch cat videos. 
We get caught up in this idea that the most brilliant, dedi-
cated student is the one who does nothing but schoolwork, and even if we try our hardest and end up with a subpar grade, we blame ourselves for not being that student, who sacriﬁ  ces sleeping, eating and showering to dedicate more time to school.
Of course, not all of us blame ourselves like that. We’d like 
to think that most of us recognized those extreme thoughts, and even though we might get them every so often, we ac-knowledge that they are ridiculous and that, yes, we deserved to take a break and cook something the last time we were studying. 
But there are some of us who get stuck in those thought 
patterns. That even though we’re trying, we could be try-ing even harder. That if we’re not perfect, we must be doing something wrong.
We’d like to address those of us who fall into that category: 
It’s okay to take a break. Take a deep breath. Put things in per-spective. It’s important to work hard, but it’s also important to take care of yourself. Sleep is important. Eating is impor-tant. Taking a break is important. If you’re so focused on one problem or one part of a big project that you just can’t seem to crack, occupying your mind with something else often helps. If anything, it will take the stress away for a brief snippet of time and refresh you for when you get back to work. To the 
perfectionists: It’s 
okay to take a break

Boots
Look down at the scraped leather toes
On my clunky black boots that I’ve worn toNew York, Miami, Athens, Washington 
D.C. With their gum rubber
Soles worn down at crowded punk showsAnd biting concrete of hot city streets.Athletic socks stained at sweaty protests.
 
My stiff leather footwear walkedThe same pavements as rich kids,Fascists and charlatans with their big wordsLike “safety” and “greatness.”
Well my boots keep me safe
and they ﬁ  t me real great. Before Colorado or WashingtonI smoked pot in these shoes, and I’ve kissed
Girls and worn dresses and punched my 
dad
In these boots.

A Small Moment
There is a small moment,
After I walk you homeAnd after we kiss,
Before we say good night,
When you nestle your headAgainst my shoulder,Tenderly, your hair against my cheek,
Long after you’ve entranced me,
Before we fall in love.
There’s a tiny perfect moment
When I can’t quite tell how long
Before you let me go.
In your embrace I can imagineThat you never do.And though the moon is rising
The hour growing late
There comes this one small momentThat hangs…That hangs…

The Widower
When I was young
He threw slow baseballsFor me to hit
In the backyard
And his voice was laughterAnd he smiledAnd I thought I’d be just like him.
And when I got older
Rooms grew quietWhen I walked inAnd they all glanced warily behind wine 
glasses
And his voice was cautiousAnd his smile didn’t match his eyesAnd I wondered but went on.
And some years ago
Rooms stayed loudAnd she threw things heavier and not so 
slow
And I don’t think they noticed I walked inAnd his voice was brokenAs he pleaded that he loved herAnd I hid in the other room.
And now she’s died
And wine glasses stay fullAs though she were still hereTo empty them and throw them ‘cross the 
room
And his voice is hollowAs he still tells himself she loved himAnd I pray I’ll never be like him.

THE EVENT WILL BE HELD ON 
TURLINGTON PLAZA.
By Brooke Henderson
Alligator Contributing Writer
People have a lot of misconceptions about 
Neal Singh’s faith.  
Singh, a UF pre-health senior who prac-
tices Sikhism, said people ﬁ  nd his turban 
confusing.To help change students’ perceptions 
about his faith, Singh said he will help tie turbans around students’ heads for Turban Day with the Sikh Student Association on 
Thursday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Turling-
ton Plaza. Students can wear a turban, or a dastaar for women, to experience what it’s like for Sikhs to stand out and be different. 
Singh said wearing his turban allows 
him to be humble, focused and disciplined.
“It represents commitment to my faith and identity,” he said.
One of the organizers, Sonia Sondhi, said 
the event aims to spread awareness of Sikh-ism and give students a chance to do some-
thing out of the ordinary by experiencing 
someone else’s culture. 
The UF psychology junior said this is key 
to preventing hate crimes.
“Just two weeks ago a Sikh man was 
shot in the arm and told to go back to his country,” the 21-year-old said.Growing up, she said she remembers 
girls being peer-pressured from their friends to cut their hair, which is sacred, and boys were beaten up in school because they 
looked different. 
“I am Sikh,” she said. “Just by being dif-
ferent, I’ve learned to likewise understand 
people’s differences. I’ve learned the im-
portance of standing against injustice any-
where — whether it be to a Muslim, Sikh — anyone.”  Sikh Student Association to host turban-tying event

Charlotte Kesl knows how much art therapy can im-
prove a patient’s health.
Kesl, who works as a coordinator for 352Creates, 
said she’s witnessed the everyday beneﬁ  ts of art hu-
manizing the hospital experience for patients, which is 
why the organization aims to promote a healthy com-
munity through art and creativity.  
On Saturday, 352Creates will host an art festival at 
Depot Park, located at 200 SE Depot Ave., where guests 
can participate in more than 40 activities from 10 a.m. 
to 2 p.m.
Visitors can play live musical chairs hosted by the 
Gainesville Girls Rock Camp, dabble in poetry writ-ing with the Writers Alliance of Gainesville and con-tribute to a 4-by-8-foot collage sponsored by Artwalk Gainesville.
Kesl said the 352Creates movement began its initia-
tive to bring people together and inspire creativity in everyone.
“You don’t have to have a lot of supplies or money 
to do that,” she said. “The challenge is making people understand how simple and important it is.”
Kesl said she hopes the annual event will continue 
to evolve and grow more to counties beyond the 352 area code.
Kimberley Mullins, the president of the Writers Alli-
ance of Gainesville, a nonproﬁ  t organization that helps writers develop their craft, said this is the organiza-tion’s ﬁ  rst time participating in the event and she wants 
people to take the initiative to start writing.
“Writing is a freedom of expression,” Mullins said. 
“Everyone has a book or story in them.”  Depot Park to

THEY TRAVEL THE U.S. AND 
DOCUMENT WILDLIFE. 
By Isa Perez
Alligator Contributing Writer 
Three UF alumni aired a web series 
March 14 with Nat Geo Wild’s You-
Tube channel.
Filipe DeAndrade, Brian Moghari 
and McKenzie Barney combined their 
love for nature and adventure to pro-
duce “Untamed With Filipe DeAn-
drade,” a 10-part web series where 
the three travel the U.S. documenting 
unique wildlife behaviors, Moghari 
said. A new episode will air on the 
channel, a sister network of National 
Geographic, every Tuesday until May 
9. 
DeAndrade, the host, and his two 
friends, Moghari and Barney, ﬁ  lmed animals including mountain lions in New Mexico and hummingbirds in Lou-isiana. Their last episode will focus on 
how the Everglades is the only place in 
the world where crocodiles and alliga-
tors coexist, said Moghari, who gradu-ated from UF in 2013 with a bachelor’s degree in telecommunication. 
Moghari, one of the cinematogra-
phers and editors of the series, said they want viewers to rediscover the U.S.’s unique animals. 
“We want people to fall in love with 
these creatures and wild spaces because 
if they can fall in love with it, then they 
will ﬁ  ght to protect it,” he said.Tim Sorel, who was one of the three 
friends’ production professors at UF, said he’s not surprised that the alumni teamed up to start their own produc-tion company and web series after graduation.
“They were always editing video 
for long hours and having such a great time doing it,” he said. “They just had this natural chemistry.”

In a story that ran on Monday, Kasey Hill was incorrectly referred to as the 
"last remaining holdover" from the Billy Donovan era. Current juniors Devin 
Robinson and Chris Chiozza also played under Donovan in their freshman seasons.

Like Spongebob without water, JJ 
Schwarz needed it. He really, really needed it. 
His .205 batting average needed it. 
His ratio of 22 strikeouts to 16 hits en-tering Tuesday’s game needed it. And most of all, his team — coming off be-ing swept against Auburn and trailing on the road — needed it. 
So Schwarz delivered. Facing an 0-2 count with the bases 
loaded, two outs and UF’s offense in desperate need of a spark, the junior ﬁ  rst baseman smacked a ball into cen-ter ﬁ  eld, plating two runs and giving the Gators their ﬁ  rst lead of the game in the top of the ﬁ  fth inning. But that wasn’t enough.Stetson came back, tying the game 
and sending it to extra innings before pinch hitter Mark Kolosvary entered in a similar situation. Bases loaded. No outs. Top of the 10th. 
And like Schwarz, he delivered. Kolosvary chopped a high-bouncing 
single that never left the inﬁ  eld but

When senior Delanie Gourley 
and junior Nicole DeWitt were asked about a teammate who’s particularly impressed them this season, the answer came to each of them fairly quickly.
And, not surprisingly, both of 
them selected the same teammate.
Sophia Reynoso.“She has absolutely dominat-
ed,” Gourley said. “And she hasn’t looked back.”    
Reynoso, a redshirt freshman 
from Palmdale, California, had to sit out her ﬁ  rst year due to an ACL injury.
Now, she boasts a batting aver-
age of .453, knocking 34 hits and 21 RBIs through the ﬁ  rst half of the season.  
In UF's most recent SEC series 
against South Carolina, she had six total hits that contributed to the sweep.
“Coming back from her injury 
and being a redshirt,” DeWitt said, “I think it’s just so exciting to see how she is on the ﬁ  eld. She’s hav-ing so much fun, and she brings so much energy to the team which makes it even more fun to play softball.”
The dominance Reynoso has brought both to the plate and the ﬁ  eld — she has yet to make an er-ror this season — has been a ma-jor force behind the 18-game win streak Florida is currently riding.
Or maybe it’s the work of De-
Witt that has the Gators on a streak that has placed them atop the SEC standings unopposed.   
The Garden Grove, California, 
native has 22 hits and four home runs on the season so far. Last sea-son, she hit six home runs total.
Or maybe the skill set that No. 
2 Florida (26-1, 5-0 SEC) has dis-played this season is due to the team camaraderie that is seen on and off the ﬁ  eld.“I think being able to come out 
to practice every day and really en-joy being with a group of girls is something that plays a huge role in how far we are actually able to make it,” DeWitt said.
It’s a chemistry that Gourley 
said she hasn’t seen since her freshman year. Gourley, who just received her second SEC Pitcher of the Week award of the season, said team members are naturally able to pick up one another with words of encouragement.
“That’s special for how close 
this team is,” Gourley said. “You can’t teach that within teams, and that’s something that is either there or it’s not, and that’s something that we have.”
The Gators have the opportu-
nity to extend their win streak to 19 games when they face USF (20-14) tonight, a team Florida already defeated 8-0 in the ﬁ  fth game of the season.
In that victory, DeWitt smacked 
her ﬁ  rst home run of the season.
But the Bulls have won four of 
their last seven games and could make for a tough opponent.  
The game begins at 6 p.m. at 
Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium.

 Softball team's freshman has 'absolutely dominated'There’s a lot to like about sports journalism. 
There’re great stories about great ath-
letes overcoming real hurdles in life, like a mother’s death or a disadvantaged upbring-ing. There’re fun pieces about the squeaki-
ness of basketball shoes. There’s beautiful writing in the form of captivating — and sometimes illumi-nating — sports-centered narratives.  
But there’s also a lot of absolute crap.Venture over to BleacherReport.com right now 
and take a look at the home page if you’d like an example of what I’m talking about. You’ll ﬁ  nd a page bursting with listicles, including a ranking of 
the NFL’s all-overpaid free agency team, an “upset 
meter” for the NCAA Tournament’s Sweet 16, and — the absolute pinnacle of sports journalism ab-surdity — a seven-round NFL mock draft. 
What do these things have in common? They 
mean absolutely nothing. 
They’re guesses. They involve no reporting and 
no new information. Somebody just sat behind a computer screen, put ﬁ  ngers to keys and cranked out a money-making story (much like I'm doing now, ironically enough). This is what a lot of sports journalism is, and in a way, it extends far beyond listicles. The occasional 
absurdity of sports

3.5 apgUF’S TOP PERFORMERS IN 
THE NCAA TOURNAMENTWEDNESDAY, MARCH 22, 2017   ALLIGATOR   15  
For example, have you ever 
wondered how stories about the 
UF football team come to be? Well, allow me to walk you through it. 
As a football reporter, you 
show up and wait until practice is over with a huddle of other beat writers. When a player is ready to talk, the gaggle of reporters approaches him — after consult-ing with team media personnel to make sure it’s OK in a way that re-sembles a child asking her mother if it’s OK to pet a caged goat — armed with recorders resembling stun guns and set up around him, not saying anything at first. Then questions begin. 
Generally, they’re exactly 
what you’d expect. Every once in awhile somebody will come pre-pared with a surprising question, but for the most part, everything is almost scripted. 
What do you think of the quar-
terback situation?
“I think we’ve got a couple of 
guys who can really play. They’re both gonna be fantastic.”
What do you think of your op-
ponent?
“They’ve got a lot of good piec-
es and a lot of talent all over the field, so we’re really looking for-ward to the challenge.”How have you seen INSERT 
PLAYER HERE improve?
“Well, he’s really gotten bet-
ter across the board. He’s not the same player he was a season ago, and we’re happy to have him.”
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. It’s so scripted that at times, 
players wonder aloud what they can and can’t say, even for seem-ingly mundane questions. For ex-ample, on Monday, UF defensive lineman Taven Bryan was asked if offensive lineman Brett Heggie was working with the first-team offense. 
“Yeah,” he said. “I think so. 
Am I allowed to say that?”
This process leads to the stories that Gators fans consume every day, and I’m not trying to knock that. I write these very kinds of stories just about every day, and they’re important. They give fans the catharsis they need by allow-ing them to escape into sports for a while, even if the information they’re reading is contrived. 
Plus, they’re reported. They’re 
the result of reporters asking play-ers for new information, receiving it and writing about it. So why am I lumping them with mock drafts and upset meters when I just said the problem with those stories is the lack of reporting?
Because they often give you the 
same result. They’re cathartic, but they don’t make a lasting impact. They don’t make you think. If anything, they numb your mind. 
And again, at times, that’s OK. I’m not going to sit here at my 
pulpit of journalism expertise as a college newspaper sports editor and proclaim that everything that isn’t serious, well-reported and in-depth is worthless. Certainly that’s not the case. 
But it’s definitely the case that 
such baseless, contrived stories can indeed be worthless if they dominate websites and control the sports media landscape. 
And often times, as the Bleach-
er Report homepage shows, that seems to be the case. 
COLUMN,  from pg. 13drove in two runs. The Gators picked up two more in the inning to carry a four-run lead into the bottom of the 10th. 
It still wasn’t enough. 
Stetson came back and tied the game at 
eight. 
Finally, shortstop Christian Hicks en-
tered in a similar situation once again. Bas-
es loaded. One out. Top of the 11th. 
For the third and final time, he deliv-
ered for the Gators. 
In a game that saw 11 pitching changes, 
33 hits and lasted over four hours, Hicks’ RBI groundout gave UF a one-run lead that 
was finally enough as the No. 13 Gators 
outlasted the Hatters 9-8 on Tuesday night in DeLand. 
The offensive breakthrough was much needed for UF (14-8), which entered the game ranked last in the SEC with a .240 batting average. 
In the win, eight Florida players picked 
up hits, including four with multiple. Six players also picked up RBIs, with catcher Mike Rivera joining Schwarz and Kolos-vary with two apiece. 
The pitching breakdowns, however, 
were not as welcome. 
Florida starter Nate Brown tossed 2.1 
innings while allowing one earned run. Southpaw reliever Nick Horvath did the same. 
Then there was Michael Byrne. The sophomore’s night started innocu-
ously enough. He breezed through 2.1 in-nings, mowing down the Hatters (8-15) with five strikeouts. But in the bottom of the eighth, he got into trouble. 
Stetson strung some hits together, plat-ing a pair of runs and tying the game at four. It was Byrne who blew Florida’s first lead. 
Freshman Tyler Dyson came on to clean 
up the mess, and he did, though not with-out a close call. 
Second baseman Deacon Liput had to 
throw out SU’s Kirk Sidwell at home to preserve the tie, leading to protests and a series of incredulous head jerks from Hat-ters coach Steve Trimper. 
Moments later, Dyson struck out Stet-
son’s Ben Rowdon with a heater framed by catcher Mike Rivera, who pumped his fist on the way into the dugout. 
However, Rivera wasn't fist pumping 
in the next inning when Dyson loaded the bases before being relieved by fresh-man Garrett Milchin, who was relieved by Andrew Baker after one out, who was relieved by Kirby McMullen after another out. It was the trio of Dyson, Milchin and Baker who blew UF’s second lead. 
But finally, McMullen, given the ball 
with a one-run lead in the bottom of the 11th, was able to shut the door on the Hat-ters, giving the Gators their first road win of the season and some much-needed mo-mentum ahead of a weekend series against No. 4 LSU.

After dominating Monday in South Car-
olina, the Florida women’s golf team did 
not let up on the competition Tuesday af-
ternoon.
The Gators secured their third straight 
victory in the Briar’s Creek Invitational in 
convincing fashion, posting a tournament-
record 15-under par score on the strength 
of seniors Maria Torres, Kelly Grassel and 
Karolina Vlckova. 
Torres wound up taking the individual 
title with a 7-under 209, topping her own collegiate-best score set last week at the SunTrust Gator Invitational by two strokes. Grassel and Vlckova tied for third and 
eighth, respectively, with scores of 3 under 
and 1 under.
Coach Emily Glaser said she was satis-
ﬁ  ed with the way Torres played on Tues-
day.
“Maria played really solid,” Glaser said 
in a release. “Two bogey-free rounds in 
this tournament is a real accomplishment.”
After bogeys on three of her last six 
holes to close out the second round, Tor-res climbed back up the leaderboard with three birdies in the decisive third round.
The Gators ultimately won the tour-
nament by 18 strokes over second-place Campbell University, but Glaser said she wasn’t entirely happy with the round her 
team played Monday.
“Our goal today was to win the day, 
and we came close to that,” Glaser said. 
“We just gave a few shots away at the end to keep us (from) having the day’s low 
round.”
Vlckova ﬁ  nished with a bogey and dou-
ble bogey on two of her last three holes, 
and junior Taylor Tomlinson carded bo-
geys on two of her last four, as did Grassel.Despite the lackluster ﬁ  nish, there were 
plenty of positives for the Gators. Along 
with Torres’ collegiate-best tournament score and second straight individual vic-
tory, UF shot 849 over two days, tying the 
Gators’ record for lowest total tournament score and securing its third team victory of the Spring season.
But Glaser said even with the different 
victories during the week, there are still opportunities to learn.
“(Tuesday), we started a little slow, but 
I was really impressed with how we hung 
tough and stayed patient and waited for 
our opportunities,” Glaser said. “Patience is going to be a really important factor for us these next few months, so I’m happy we got a chance to work on that.”
The Gators have the next week and a 
half off until they head back up to South Carolina to participate in the Clemson Invitational from March 31 to April 2.
