Alachua County is one of 35 counties facing 
a statewide review by the Florida Department 
of Law Enforcement after a Pensacola chemist was found tampering with evidence.An investigation into the Escambia County 
Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce evidence room revealed that prescription pain pills were being replaced with over-the-counter medication, according to the FDLE. 
The investigation found that Joseph Graves, 
crime lab analyst supervisor at the FDLE Pen-sacola Regional Ofﬁ  ce Center, worked on all the cases with the missing drugs. Since 2006, 
Graves reportedly was involved in 2,600 cases 
for 80 law enforcement agencies.
Tampered evidence could lead to the re-lease of prisoners and dropped drug charges in some cases.
Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce spokes-
woman Sgt. Becky Butscher said investigators 
have identiﬁ  ed cases in Alachua County “but 
until an audit is done, we are unable to deter-mine the exact number,” she said. “Ramiﬁ  ca-tions will be signiﬁ  cant.”

When Alicia Lew’s family friend lost the 
use of his legs in a car accident, she decided 
to raise money for spinal cord research by 
doing what she loves — hosting an art auc-
tion.
Lew, a 21-year-old UF biology senior, 
held her gallery on Jan. 25 in the ballroom 
of the Mission Inn Club and Resort, located 
in Howey-in-the-Hills, Fla.
“I loved the idea of having an event to 
incorporate art with my passion for medi-cine,” she said.
A variety of pieces from local and pro-
fessional artists, including some from Lew herself, were auctioned off throughout the night. Other, non-art items were also auc-
tioned, such as tennis and ballroom dancing  
lessons and even a promissory note for a 25-person paella meal from Eduardo Sainz, the family friend who inspired the auction.
On Monday, she took her $31,145 in pro-
ceeds and handed it to UF’s Paul J. Reier and his colleagues in the form of a comically large, lavender-colored check.
Lew said she chose Reier due to his re-
search in spinal cord injuries at UF’s McK-night Brain Institute.
She invited Reier to the auction, where 
he got to meet Sainz.
“I know it’s corny, but it’s always nice 
to put a face to things we’re working on,” Reier said.
The money will be used on something UF senior sells 
art to fundraise for research

Jacob Embuscado thought he belonged 
on the road when he was riding through 
campus on wheels.
But at the start of the Spring semester, 
he was pulled over and issued a citation 
for riding his longboard in the bike lane on 
Newell Drive.
Embuscado, an 18-year-old UF tele-
communication freshman, said he was only vaguely aware of the Florida statute prohibiting all forms of skates and skate-boards in the bike lane and roadway at the time. He said he still doesn’t understand the reasoning behind the restriction and wants to petition it as soon as he gains 
enough support. 
“It just seems like a preposterous rule 
to exclude longboarders,” he said. “At cer-
tain points, I feel like even other modes of transportation should be included in the bike lane.”University Police Ofﬁ  cer Gregory Cas-
tronover said riding anything that is not supposed to be in the bike lane is consid-ered a moving violation — a ticket worth a minimum of $154 in Alachua County.  
Castronover said the department’s goal 
is to educate.

mation, they go on their way,” he said. “If they talk themselves into something a little bit more intensive, then they might get a Longboarders ticketed for using bike lanes

� THE WARDS 
RAISE COWS IN AN ECOLOGICALLY FRIENDLY MANNER.
ALEXIA FERNANDEZ
Alligator Contributing Writer
Ward’s Supermarket, a fam-
ily-owned independent grocery 
store, is introducing its own brand of sustainably grown Angus beef later this month.
Bryan Ward, the meat man-
ager for Ward’s, said he has been planning on introducing a new brand of beef to the family business for the last two years.
“We’ve always had just 
conventional beef, like from Colorado, Wyoming, Iowa, the Midwest,” said Ward, 30. “This 
isn’t really replacing what we 
carry, this is just adding to our market.”
The Ward family’s farm is 
at the center of this new enter-prise.
Located 25 miles north of 
Gainesville in Brooker, Fla., Ward and his father have raised 
cows in an ecologically friendly 
manner.
“There are so many people 
nowadays that want more lo-cal instead of further away, so we’re going for that niche,” Ward said. “We’re also hoping that the prospect of our cows being humanely raised will ap-
peal to customers.”
Ward has not yet developed 
a price margin for the beef, but 
he said he hopes it will compete well with the conventionally raised products already selling at Ward’s.“What we’re hoping is that 
it’ll be more comparable to or slightly above conventional,” Ward said. “But not as high as organic or grass-fed beef.”
Seaton Tarrant, alumni fel-
low at the department of politi-cal science at UF, has grown his own food since 1996 and said he thinks Ward’s is the hub of the community.
Tarrant said Ward’s is better 
than ecologically friendly stores like Trader Joe’s because it fo-
cuses on local producers. 
“The idea is to offer some-
thing that you can give to your 
community,” he said.
Ian Siljestrom, a 22-year-old 
UF sustainability and the built environment senior, said the local aspect of Ward’s Angus beef brand is a good thing for 
Gainesville sustainability.
“I think Gainesville is deﬁ  -
nitely proactive, especially due 
to small businesses like this one,” he said. “There are a lot of people in the community that are pushing for more sustain-able methods of living.”
One such supporter is Dan-
iel Tillman, a 21-year-old UF political science and psychol-ogy senior.
“It’s very important to know 
where your food comes from,” Tillman said. 
Tillman said he believes lo-
cal farming is beneﬁ  cial and allows consumers to have a 
better idea of the details that go 
into raising their food.
“In industrialized farming, 
what they feed the animals is not natural,” he said. “Cows should not be eating corn or corn seeds. They should be eat-ing grass.”Ward’s supermarket

Undergraduate students with 
innovative ideas are set to con-
verge, collaborate and create in a new competition offered by UF this semester.
Students can pitch any innova-
tive idea in need of funding or a patent to a panel of judges to com-pete for cash prizes totaling up to $10,000. 
Though this is the ﬁ  rst time the 
competition will take place at UF, the InVenture Prize originated at the Georgia Institute of Technology 
in Atlanta, said Carlo Candela, di-
rector of InVenture Prize at UF.
“They have done such a great 
job,” Candela said. “Our goal is to lean on what they have done so far.”
Mimicking the success of Geor-
gia Tech’s competition is the main goal, but the addition of UF stu-dents’ Gator ﬂ  air is what organizers hope will make this competition a popular annual event.
Sam Grace, assistant director 
of InVenture Prize at UF, said he 
wants to see UF grow in response 
to this competition.
“Georgia Tech is known for 
their engineering. They’re a techni-cal school, and Florida isn’t,” Grace said. “We’re trying to show that we can compete with anyone.”   
The deadline for online regis-
tration is Wednesday. The original 
deadline was Jan. 17, but Candela 
said the deadline was extended to allow for more teams to enter. The venue has yet to be chosen. Twelve teams are registered to 
compete, but Candela said they are looking for about 20.
Ian Mitchell, the president of the 
UF Entrepreneurship Club, said these types of competitions prime the pump for innovation among UF students. 
“It gets people out of their com-
fort zone,” Mitchell said. 
Tim Garofalo, a 21-year-old UF 
ﬁ  nance senior, said he thinks the competition will bring students together in a way no class or lab could.
“The InVenture Prize sounds 
like a really neat competition that will foster great relationships be-
tween business majors and engi-
neers,” Garofalo said. “I think a lot of my friends would like to see this become bigger.”Prize draws student entrepreneurs4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 2014

� REPORT: A MAN 
PUNCHED HIS ROOMMATE.
JENNA LYONS
Alligator Staff Writer
Alachua Police used a Taser 
on a Fort Lauderdale man Sun-
day after police said he got in an argument with his room-mate over a Super Bowl bet.
Officers arrested 49-year-
old Thomas Steven Pindell on charges of battery and resisting without violence, according to an arrest report. 
At about 10:30 p.m., Pindell 
got into an argument with his roommate at the Quality Inn, located at 15960 NW U.S. High-
way 441. His roommate locked 
him out of their hotel room, ac-cording to the report. 
Pindell got the manager, and 
on their way back to the room, 
his roommate walked around 
the corner and said “You didn’t have to hit me,” according to 
the report. Pindell then attacked him and started punching him in the face.
Police arrived and saw Pin-
dell hit his roommate in the mouth, according to the report. An officer told Pindell to put his hands behind his back. When he resisted, another officer put a Taser to his ribcage and warned him he would use it.
Pindell told the officers they 
wouldn’t use the Taser and that he would not put his hands be-hind his back, at which point the officer used the Taser.
Pindell told officers he 
punched his roommate in self defense because his roommate threatened to use a pocket knife. The manager said no one 
mentioned a knife, and the offi-
cers did not find one, according to the report.
Officers booked Pindell 
into the Alachua County Jail at about 11:30 p.m., where he re-mains as of press time in lieu of a $30,000 bond.Police tase, arrest in

An algorithm published in a 
new UF study could benefit Flor-
ida’s $9-billion citrus industry by allowing growers to predict crop 
yields both earlier and with im-
proved accuracy.
The study, conducted by Won-
suk “Daniel” Lee, would allow 
growers to know exactly how much 
fruit is on their trees sooner than before, making it easier for them to figure out the ideal time to harvest.
Lee said the model could also 
give growers a way to identify troubled areas in their groves.
“If you know one place pro-
duces more fruit and one place 
produces less fruit … you can focus 
on the low-producing area to cor-rect those problems,” said Lee, a UF agricultural and biological en-gineering professor. “And thereby you can increase your yield and profit.”
Lee was able to compare the 
productivity of trees in different ar-
eas of a grove using image-process-
ing software, which can detect the presence of individual fruits.
Because immature green fruits 
are so well camouflaged, the com-puter has to use color along with textural and spatial information to isolate them from photographs and come up with a number, Lee said.
Thomas Spreen, citrus market-
ing and trade expert, said growers currently use a limb-count method in which they randomly select a limb from a tree and count the number of fruits on it.
That number is then used to ex-
trapolate a figure for the entire tree and eventually the orchard, the county and the state.
Essentially it’s a guess, Spreen 
said, “but they’ve done it this way for 50 to 60 years, so it’s fairly well-developed.”
However, Spreen said he thinks 
there is still room for progress.“Anything that improves the 
quality of the information in the system benefits both the buyers and the sellers,” he said.
Katie Rogers, a 22-year-old UF 
horticultural science senior and treasurer of the Gator Citrus Club, 
said the algorithm holds promise 
for sellers in particular.
“It’s beneficial to be able to pre-
dict your yield,” she said, “because one of the most difficult things in farming is not knowing what you will end up making at the end of the season.”
Lee said it could still take two 
to three more years until the algo-rithm is ready for commercial use. Even then, growers might be hesi-tant to switch from more conven-tional methods.
Cecil Nelson, a 69-year-old 
Florida citrus grower, and his wife hand-planted their San Mateo grove in 1986 and have been pre-
dicting their crop yield the tradi-
tional way ever since.  
Nelson said if he’s to be taken 
as an example, then Lee might be right.
“I won’t be switching anything. 
I’m almost 70 — this is it for me,” Nelson said. “But I do think it sounds like a good idea.”Formula from UF study to help citrus 
growers with efficiency, accuracy
It was inspired by a friend 
with spinal cord injuries
that has a long lifetime, such as a 
new piece of equipment, he said. A plaque with Sainz’ name will 
accompany whatever the money 
is used for.
Lew’s Art for Hope gallery 
was the second fundraiser she’s 
spearheaded. The first, Art for the 
Heart, raised roughly $11,000 for cardiovascular research in 2012.
After receiving waves of posi-
tive feedback for her first gallery, Lew planned on hosting a second in two years. She was still consid-ering research fields for her next 
fundraiser when she heard the news of Sainz’ accident.
Sainz, a 54-year-old Lees-
burg, Fla., resident, was on his 
way home from work when he stopped at a red light behind an-
other car. The driver of a vehicle 
behind Sainz’ car failed to break, hitting him at full speed and ef-fectively sandwiching him be-
tween the two vehicles.
Sainz said he applauds Lew 
for her dedication to the cause 
and hopes more people will fol-low her. He’s known Lew “since 
she was a little one.”
“We need more people like 
her,” he said. “Research is the 
only future for people like me.”ARt , from page 1Some students aren’t aware of the laws

Jeffrey Dickens, a 20-year-old UF mechanical engi-
neering junior and president of Gator Longboarding, 
said he’s only been pulled over once because he wasn’t aware of the statute at the time. Since then, he said, he 
tries to ride on the sidewalk as much as possible to avoid 
confrontation.
Even though he said he knows they’re trying to keep 
campus safe, Dickens said it seems police are looking for reasons to pull people over. 
“Everybody complains about it,” he said. “Every-
body seems to be getting pulled over.” 
He said riding longboards on the sidewalk can be 
inconvenient because the wheels can easily get caught 
on anything about an inch off the ground, which makes 
cracks or bumps in the sidewalk a problem. Dickens said he has seen longboarders go flying into students on the 
sidewalk, though the accidents usually only cause minor 
scrapes.
Carrie Vath, an interdisciplinary ecology UF graduate 
student, said she rides her bike on campus and wouldn’t mind sharing the bike lane with longboarders as long as they were under the same restrictions as cyclists. 
FreeRide Surf and Skate Shop manager Peter Harter, 
34, agreed. 
“Longboarding is not a sport where we’re grinding 
on concrete,” he said. “We are not doing anything that the average mountain bike or street bicycle wouldn’t do.”longbo ARd , from page 1“If you know one place

“They will be coming in the next few days to

because of this situation,” Butscher said.  “We will

eral dozen cases were revealed to have missing pills over the weekend.

have been tampered with,” she said. “We have nev-er had to do an undertaking like this.”
Along with Alachua County, Marion, Columbia, 
Lafayette, Suwannee and Hamilton counties were also listed by the FDLE as potentially affected areas in North Central Florida. 
While a motive has yet to be uncovered, 
Plessinger said Graves could’ve been using or traf-ficking drugs.

The Levin College of Law will 
host two events to commemorate 
and discuss the issues surrounding the 2012 shooting of Trayvon Mar-tin.
The events are co-sponsored by 
the college’s Center on Children and Families and Center for the Study of Race & Race Relations.
The first event, “Looking Back, Moving Forward,” will be a town hall-style open forum, said Nancy 
Dowd, director of the CCF. 
The event will take place 
Wednesday from 6 to 8 p.m. in the UF Law Chesterfield Smith Memo-
rial Classroom, HOL 180.
The purpose of this event is “to 
give an opportunity for a free flow 
of discourse about Trayvon Mar-
tin,” she said.
“We hope for high school and 
college students who are closest to the circumstances of Trayvon Mar-
tin to discuss their feelings, fears 
and what changes they would like 
to happen,” Dowd said.
The second event will be cen-
tered on an academic lecture from 
Duke University sociology pro-fessor Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, fol-lowed by discussion with a panel 
of experts.
The lecture will be Feb. 13 from 
6 to 8 p.m. in HOL 180. 
Anju Kaduvettoor Davidson, as-sistant director of the CSRRR, said 
that Bonilla-Silva’s lecture would 
focus on topics like implicit rac-
ism and colorblind racism and how these issues apply to the Trayvon 
Martin case.
Kristin Babik, a 20-year-old UF 
psychology and criminology ju-
nior, said she believes these events 
will shed light on how to decrease

Student Government Pro-
ductions will host Dispatch on 
Friday for the band’s first live show in Florida.
Dispatch, a popular inde-
pendent rock band, will per-form at 7 p.m. on Flavet Field, said Nicole Berrio, SGP head director of public relations.
The event is free and open 
to the public, so no tickets are required.
“Everybody loves a great 
jam band,” Berrio said. “A lot of 
fans, not only in UF but in the 
surrounding Gainesville area, are going to come out and sup-port the band, mostly through-out Tampa, Orlando, Jackson-ville and Tallahassee.”
With influences from acous-
tic rock, folk-rock, reggae and funk, Dispatch defines the broad audience SGP seeks to 
entertain, she said. 
Berrio said the specifics of 
the contract with Dispatch bar 
SGP from sharing the amount of money the band will receive for performing.
Steve Montalvo, a 20-year-
old UF plant science junior and new listener of the band, said 
he would attend the concert.
“I can see myself listening 
to them non-stop,” Montalvo 
said. “Their music really speaks to me. When they sing the lyr-ics and play the songs, it really resonates with me.”Dispatch to hold free

A UF alumnus has created a 
slicker way to save cooking oil.
John Yelverton, a 2001 UF 
chemical engineering alumnus, 
created the Coastal Pro oil strain-
er to transport and strain oil di-rectly to a storage container. 
This product is the newest edi-
tion in his line of personal fryer products, which he sells through his outdoor cookware business based in Destin, Fla.
“It can be really messy to use 
coffee filters or other items to strain the oil,” the 35-year-old said. “I want to make it easier for people to store and refrigerate 
their oil.”
The funnel is about the size 
of a normal cooking funnel and 
is combined with a reusable, ex-tra-fine stainless steel mesh that separates small food solids from the oil. 
He said he hopes to start sell-
ing the strainer on his website by 
the end of this year for $9.99.
Yelverton said he came up 
with the idea when he learned 
storing oil at room temperature then reusing it can be dangerous 
to one’s health.
George Baker, an assistant sci-
entist in the UF department of 
food science and human nutri-tion, said refrigerating cooking oil helps slow down different chemical reactions.
It can also prevent bacterial 
growth, he said.
Baker said once oil has been 
used and heated enough, it in-creases reaction rates, which can change the taste and color of the oil. 
“Old oil isn’t necessarily bad 
for human health,” Baker said. “It’s going to taste bad before it becomes toxic.”
Once left out, Baker said there 
is no set time when any food safe-ty issues occur with oil.
Melanie Abou-Jaoude, a 21-
year-old UF chemical engineer-
ing senior, said she believes used 
cooking oil should be kept clean if reused.
But she doesn’t think she’ll be 
purchasing Yelverton’s strainer 
any time soon.
“I wouldn’t buy it,” she said. 
“You can use other disposable 
strainers that will be guaranteed 
to be clean after every use.”Gator alumnus invents less-mess

MIAMI — David Beckham 
will take part in a news con-
ference Wednesday to discuss 
his progress in trying to bring 
a Major League Soccer expan-sion team to Miami.
MLS Commissioner Don 
Garber and Miami-Dade Coun-ty Mayor Carlos Gimenez will also attend the session, which was announced Monday. The league has discussed placing 
its next two expansion teams 
in Miami and Atlanta.
Expansion in Miami is con-
tingent on securing a financing plan and location for a new stadium. Beckham has scouted possible sites and is seeking 
investors to assist with startup 
costs such as stadium construc-tion and player acquisitions.
Among those who might 
become involved is Beckham’s friend LeBron James, who has had recent conversations with the retired soccer star about bringing a team to Miami.
“It’s looking very prom-
ising,” James said Monday. “Hopefully they can go in the right direction as we all 
planned.”

Hoffman death, 
examines heroin use
Philip Seymour Hoffman’s death at age 46 shocked the 
U.S. on Sunday, and as the investigation reveals more 
details about his death — strong evidence points to a 
heroin overdose, as he was found in his Manhattan apart-ment with a needle stuck in his arm — many voices have con-
tributed to the discussion of his legacy as a ﬁ  ne actor and his 
struggle with drug abuse. 
Artistic brilliance is too often coupled with addiction. 
Famed Beat writer Jack Kerouac used amphetamines to stay up for days at a time and write. It’s common knowledge that 
Ernest Hemingway was an alcoholic. The Beatles — before experimenting with LSD in the later years — abused speed 
in the form of phenmetrazine diet pills in their early years in 
Hamburg. The great Billie Holiday’s heroin addiction led to legal trouble and imprisonment. 
“Mr. Hoffman’s gifts were widely celebrated while he was 
alive,” A.O. Scott wrote for The New York Times. “But the 
shock of his death on Sunday revealed, too soon and too late, 
the astonishing scale of his greatness and the solidity of his 
achievement. We did not lose just a very good actor. We may 
have lost the best one we had. He was only 46, and his death, 
apparently from a drug overdose, foreshortened a career that 
was already monumental.”
According to the Washington Post, Hoffman struggled 
with drugs from a young age. 
“‘I got sober when I was 22 years old’ and went into a drug 
rehabilitation program at the time, Hoffman told CBS’s ‘60 
Minutes’ in 2006. Asked whether he abused drugs or alcohol, 
Hoffman said: ‘It was all that stuff. Yeah. It was anything I could get my hands on. Yeah. I liked it all.’”
He relapsed in 2012 after being clean for 20 years. 
Heroin use is growing, the Washington Post reported. 
In 2012, a federal survey found the number of people in its 
sample who said they’d used heroin in the last month had 
nearly doubled since 2007, proving that heroin isn’t the fringe 
drug it used to be. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration attributed the increase to more pure 
and less expensive heroin now available on the market and to 
the crackdown on prescription painkillers, making drugs like 
OxyContin harder to acquire. 
In 2010, the DEA reported 3,038 people overdosed on her-
oin that year, a sharp increase from 1,879 in 2007. Heroin kills many ﬁ  rst-time users, the Washington Post reported, because 
it shuts down bodies’ natural breathing reﬂ  exes.
This week, Hollywood lost a tremendously talented actor. 
We only hope that through this tragedy, substance abusers 
can ﬁ  nd the strength to seek help. 
“He had a rare ability to illuminate the varieties of human 
ugliness,” Scott wrote in closing his Times article. “No one ever did it so beautifully.”
If you or someone you know is using heroin, please use 
the National Institute of Drug Abuse’s online resources to seek help, or call 1-800-662-HELP (4357).The drifter who changed our history
With the national spotlight often on Floridians 
like Casey Anthony and Terry Jones, there’s not much we can be proud of. The Sunshine State 
isn’t exactly known for its positive contributions. How-ever, there is one exception, and we recently marked its 50th anniversary.
A while back in Panama City, there was a man named 
Clarence Gideon. One June morning in 1961, patrons found that the city’s Bay Harbor Pool Room had been bur-glarized. A witness said he’d seen Gideon walking away from the scene with a bottle of wine and coins around 5:30 a.m. 
Upon investigation, police found Gideon at a motel 
with alcohol and change in his pockets. Gideon was ar-rested and was stuck in the cooler until trial, unable to af-ford bail.
One thing to note is that Gideon was dirt poor, and if 
there’s one thing the indigent can’t afford, it’s a lawyer.
At his ﬁ  rst trial, Gideon asked the judge to appoint a 
defense attorney. The response couldn’t have been more blunt: “Mr. Gideon, I am sorry, but I cannot appoint coun-sel to represent you in this case. Under the laws of the State of Florida, the only time the court can appoint counsel to represent a defendant is when that person is charged with a capital offense...” 
Gideon stubbornly persisted, “The United States Su-
preme Court says I am entitled to be represented by coun-sel.”
Let’s pause here for a moment to see how deluded 
Gideon was. The law of the land since 1942 only required states to appoint lawyers for defendants with special circumstances, such as the possibility of a death penalty sentence (see Betts v. Brady). Gideon’s optimism could be forgiven — after all, he was a drifter who had run away from home when he was in middle school.
With no lawyer, Gideon was forced to represent him-
self. The entire trial took a day, and the jury found him guilty. Gideon was sentenced to ﬁ  ve years in Florida State Prison. 
Convinced of his innocence, 
Gideon petitioned the Florida Supreme Court. The response from Tallahassee wasn’t favor-able: The appeal was denied.  
A normal person would give 
up and just serve his time in pris-
on at this point. But thankfully, Gideon wasn’t normal.
This might sound like a guy pursuing a fairy tale: He 
decided to send a letter — ofﬁ  cially known as a “writ of ha-beas corpus” — to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Using prison stationary and a pencil, he hand-wrote a short, awkward plea from his cell to the highest court in the country.
The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider his case and 
appointed Abe Fortas, one of the most brilliant lawyers and a future Supreme Court justice, to represent Gideon. The entire country knew the signiﬁ  cance of this case as thousands of inmates just like Gideon were convicted in courts without proper legal aid.
On the morning of March 18, 1963, the justices were 
ready. Justice Hugo Black declared, on behalf of a unani-mous Supreme Court, Gideon’s conviction unconstitu-tional.  The ruling changed the course of our country by creating a public defender system that would guarantee all defendants a lawyer, regardless of their ﬁ  nancial situ-ations.
The case of Gideon is relevant to various contempo-
rary issues, from the need of prison reform to the debate of whether ordinary people have a “right to health care.” Gideon’s struggles have a nice ending — he was acquit-ted and resumed his quiet life until passing away in Fort Lauderdale in 1972 — but more than anything, we should extract lessons from his story.

Monday column about climate change
Thanks for your interesting note on cli-
mate change. 
We conservative Republicans too un-
derstand that science is vital to helping us 
in certain areas of life. 
Not one of us would care to have our 
cities swamped with rising oceans or lands turned into deserts. 
However, we take a much more cau-
tious approach than you do. 
We also know the left has predicted 
very poorly other drastic things they claimed were on their way in the past: het-erosexual AIDS, silicone breast implants, overpopulation of the earth, DDT, Alar on apples, 35 million starving Americans and secondhand smoke, etc. 
We understand climate is an extraor-
dinarily complex topic with dozens of parameters potentially affecting it. We un-derstand there are thousands of scientists around the world who study these various parameters and are highly skeptical about making any strong predictions of climate 100 years from now. We understand by studying history that science is often pure science and is often affected by psychol-ogy and politics. We also understand that even if Mr. Gore did incredibly radical things like completely altering our use of energy and thereby dramatically crushing economies all over the world, it is highly unlikely that this would have much effect on the issue, particularly if America were the only one to sign up for such a radical action.
Before you vote for more leftists to or-
der us with 5,000 pages of new laws to radically change our economy and stop using fossil fuels and thereby stop enjoy-ing our laptops and cars and air condition-ers and medicines and homes and clothing and airplane travel, maybe read some sci-entists not aligned with and perhaps not greatly biased by the Democratic left. 
Your concerns may be right, but be very 
careful before you root for a heart trans-plant on a guy with chest pain when all he needs is some aspirin — or maybe just some reassurance that all will be well.

Letter to the Editor
It’s OK to like 
labels on things other 
than clothes — or really, on any-
thing but your 
clothes   — because those things can be itchy and un-cooperative. Some people say labels are limiting, but I argue they are liberating. As humans, it is easier for us to categorize things. Labeling 
helps us process the world 
around us, as well as our-selves. 
Self-discovery involves 
pushing your boundaries as much as it does realizing when you can no longer push. For instance, you may force your-self to go to parties and group 
dinners even though you 
would rather stay at home, watch Netﬂ  ix with your cat and draw. Realizing you’re an introvert may allow you to not feel so guilty about saying no to invites you don’t feel up to accepting. Self-ascribing that label is not putting a limit on 
yourself but rather letting you 
be who you are.  
Accurate labeling is also 
important when dealing with mental or neurological dis-orders. If you are depressed, before you are diagnosed you may just think you are lazy, incompetent and worthless. 
Receiving a label from a doc-
tor can be such a relief in this situation — to discover the way you feel is not your fault. And once you know there is a reason behind your illness, you can go about managing it instead of feeling helpless. Instead of your symptoms 
being enigmatic details that 
make you feel incapable for not dealing with them, you now have a tangible name to associate your feelings with. 
When “Britain’s Got Tal-
ent” singer Susan Boyle was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, she said it gave her 
a sense of comfort. She told 
the U.K. Observer, “Now I have a clearer understanding of what’s wrong, and I feel re-lieved and a bit more relaxed about myself.” Having a 
word or words to describe your-self to others can help you ac-
quire resources 
that you need as well as make re-lationships with people who have 
common experiences. 
However, there are ways 
to abuse labeling. 
A person is more than just 
one part of him or herself.  You may have depression, but you are not depression; it is not your deﬁ  ning character-istic. You may also be an avid video gamer, a graphic novel-ist and a Trekkie. Sometimes people can let one aspect of their identity consume them, 
or they use it as an excuse for 
other actions. 
For instance, if you have 
Asperger’s, that diagnosis should be a means to under-standing oneself and learning how to interact with the world considering your limitations. It should not be a scapegoat 
for thoughtless behavior.  
Similarly, some people mis-
use labels. They go through 
them like toilet paper: Some-one who checks on all the locks before she goes to bed calls herself OCD, a person who washes his hands before every meal is a germaphobe, 
someone who had a bad day 
is depressed or someone who has a nervous stomach before a speech has social anxiety. The overuse of words that de-scribe serious, life-debilitating illnesses weakens their mean-ings and hurts people who are really suffering. 
But with an estimated one 
million words in the English language, you can mindfully choose words with deﬁ  nitions that ﬁ  t you. 
You probably don’t want 
to wear your identities on your clothes like you do la-bels — that may be a bit too 
forward — but just knowing 
them for yourself can be really comforting.

opinions@alligator.orgThe U.S. federal government is not 
known for always making the best choices. In some states, it’s legal to 
marry your ﬁ  rst cousin but not a member of the same sex. However, one of America’s biggest ﬂ  ubs is the propagation of alcohol and the criminalization of marijuana. 
Ever since the end of Prohibition, alco-
hol has been legal in the U.S. First made available to anyone over the age of 18, Congress changed the national minimum drinking age to 21 in 1984. Marijuana, however, was deemed illegal in 1937 and has remained so ever since. From then on, more than 20 million Americans have been arrested and convicted of marijuana-related crimes. This is where the issues begin because the re-sults of these laws changed the course of our history. 
Under the inﬂ  uence of alcohol, users become agitat-
ed, belligerent, ill, deluded and make incredibly poor decisions. This is because alcohol somewhat numbs the brain’s abilities by altering the chemical messages that control the body’s thought processes, behaviors and emotions. Because of this, users are more likely to get into a car while drunk, start a ﬁ  ght and vomit all over the sidewalks of Midtown right outside Pizza by the Slice. Aside from the damage it does to your brain, al-cohol is incredibly corrosive to other parts of the body as well. Drinking large quantities of alcohol can perma-nently damage the liver, heart, pancreas and immune system and lead to cancers of the mouth, throat, esoph-agus and breasts. And this stuff is legal.
Marijuana is a different animal. While smoking or 
eating pot still puts the user in a state of insobriety, the long-term effects are much less damaging to the body. The use of marijuana puts the user in an elevated state of relaxation and — let’s be honest — hunger. A person high on weed will never challenge a random person to a ﬁ  ght, won’t vomit from nausea all over Midtown in front of Pizza by the Slice and most certainly won’t have a hangover the next day. Smoking a large amount of weed may lead to a temporary loss of coordination, memory retention and, depending on the person, minor anxiety. Unless the mari-juana is laced with other chemicals, the average pot user does not experience any negative side effects while getting high.
Marijuana is not only used for getting 
high. Recent studies have shown that the use of marijuana helps with those suffer-ing from epilepsy. It not only weakens the severity of seizures, but it also reduces the occurrence of them. Although the studies 
are limited, as marijuana becomes legalized in more ar-eas of the U.S., more trials will be held. 
Marijuana has also been known to give cancer pa-
tients relief from nausea due to treatment and increase their appetites. Researchers have isolated strains from the marijuana plant, allowing speciﬁ  c dosages to be given to patients with predictable outcomes. A few of these strains have even been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Some supporters even claim consuming marijuana inhibits the growth of tumors.
Overall, it seems there is no clear precedent regard-
ing what makes substances legal and what does not. Both alcohol and marijuana have their pros and cons yet are enjoyed by millions every day. Promoting alco-hol and shunning marijuana is a ridiculous notion and a decision our government should re-evaluate. 
Preventing the population from accessing a sub-
stance that can change people’s lives for the better and allow users to have a positive non-sober, non-violent experience, is the real crime here. 
Legalizing and taxing marijuana will not only make 
the selling and growing of weed much less dangerous, but it will also add major tax revenue. 
In a controlled environment, we can work toward 
controlling substance abuse. 
I urge you to keep an open mind and remain in-
formed about the uses and abuses of both alcohol and marijuana. Enjoy responsibly.

A tall, slim man with a gray po-
nytail pedaled his bicycle toward 
the protesters. He had an idea.
“Let’s start chanting ‘plug not 
pipe!’” he told the crowd. “Just say 
no to big oil, right on!” 
About 60 protesters from various 
Gainesville organizations united in 
protest on Bo Diddley Community Plaza Monday, calling for President Barack Obama to stop the expansion of the Keystone XL Pipeline. 
If granted Presidential Permit, 
energy company TransCanada will 
install 875 miles of a pipeline that 
would transport about 830,000 bar-rels of oil per day spanning from the U.S./Canada border in Montana to Steele City, Neb., according to a State Department statement. The statement concluded the pro-
posed pipeline will not signiﬁ  cantly add to greenhouse emissions. 
But activism organization CRE-
DO organized several groups to participate in a national day of ac-tion.
Karen Epple, a local council orga-
nizer for MoveOn.org, gathered the Gainesville protest. She said down-
playing climate change and the en-
vironmental damage the pipeline could cause is similar to publicity tactics used by tobacco companies.
“Basically this is like the cancer 
of the world,” Epple said.
UF anthropology graduate stu-
dent Christina Callicott brought vigil candles for the event. She said 
the pipeline will permanently harm 
the environment instead of creating permanent jobs. 
“It’s an issue of human rights 
because climate change is affecting people all over the world,” she said.Locals unite in protest

A Gainesville radio station has recently 
made a switch to a different frequency to 
offer a better signal that reaches a larger audience.   
Party 99.5, a local electronic dance mu-
sic radio station, is now Party 100.9. The parent company, New York-based 
JVC Broadcasting Inc., made the switch be-cause the original frequency didn’t reach 
many dorms and ofﬁ  ce buildings, said 
Chad Hallmark, director of client services. 
The programming will be playing on 
both channels until 99.5 is sold, he said.
Ana Pinto, a 21-year-old UF econom-
ics junior and a promoter for the Dynasty Group, said she is a frequent listener of the station.
“Party 100.9 is the only station that 
plays in my car in Gainesville,” Pinto said, adding that she heard about the switch while listening to the radio.
Hallmark said the station has gained 
more listeners than expected since its ra-dio debut in June. 
He said he expects to see the new fre-
quency’s audience grow even more.
“We expect to dominate Gainesville,” 
Hallmark said.Party 99.5 changes frequency, moves EDM beats to 100.9

A downtown bar has poured, shaken and 
strained its way to a list of the top 100 bars in the 
South. 
Southern Living Magazine ranked 2nd Street 
Speakeasy, located at 21 SW Second St., in its list released earlier this year. 
T.J. Palmieri, general manager of the bar, said 
the bar was contacted via Facebook earlier this January by the list’s author, who asked for a cock-tail recipe. 
He said the business was honored to be con-
tacted in a small city like Gainesville by such a 
large magazine.
“It’s obviously great to be recognized,” Palm-
ieri, 33, said. “A lot of people have told us what we 
can and can’t do in a small town.”
The bar is kept dark to give off a chill, laid-back 
atmosphere, he said. On nights that are less busy, bartenders make drinks in front of the customers. The bar also features a “revolving menu,” Palmieri said.
“If you come in and the menu really isn’t your 
thing, we then go into a dialogue,” he said. “We try to make something up for you on the spot.”
Michelle Pando, a UF health science junior, cel-
ebrated her 21st birthday by visiting the bar last week. She said she enjoyed the intimacy of the set-ting.
“It was very calm but enjoyable,” Pando said. 
“Small, but very nice.” 
She said she also enjoyed her drink — the 2nd 
Street 75, made up of Amsterdam gin, lemon, strawberries, rhubarb bitters and sparkling white wine. 
The bar will also be participating in the maga-
zine’s region-wide Happy Hour on Friday, offer-
ing a discount on the drink featured in the top 100 
list — the Spaghetti Western, made of High West Double Rye, Fernet Branca, sherry, local honey and bitters.
Palmieri said he’s excited the bar has gained 
traction.
“It was really nice to be validated for myself 
and for the staff,” Palmieri said.Downtown bar ranked among top

While UF is trying to Make It 
Reitz, student organizations are 
feeling the squeeze. 
Part of the third ﬂ  oor of the 
Reitz Union that houses club of-ﬁ  ces closed at the end of January because of the Reitz renovation project, leaving students to adjust to smaller spaces. 
Organizations located next to Student Government Finance moved to tables in the gallery on the second ﬂ  oor of Reitz. 
Reitz Union executive director 
Eddie Daniels said a transition pe-riod is necessary to bring the build-ing to a higher functioning stan-dard and to create more space.
Christina Pham, a member of 
the fundraising board of directors for the Pre-Dental American Stu-dent Dental Association, said she thinks many people don’t know the location of the club’s ofﬁ  ce be-cause of the move.
However, students have been 
understanding about the transi-tion, she said. 
“It has its ups and downs,” 
the 21-year-old UF food science and human nutrition senior said. “(Staff have) been very accommo-dating, which is really cool.” 
Daniel Ramon, a 20-year-old 
UF biochemistry and molecular biology sophomore and Alpha Ep-silon Delta ﬁ  scals director, said the 
move makes it hard to have guests. 
For the most part, he said only or-ganization members can ﬁ  t in the 
ofﬁ  ce space, so meeting with po-tential new members is difﬁ  cult.
American Medical Student As-
sociation director Noah Ellis said he hasn’t seen any positive effects of the move. The 20-year-old UF biomedical engineering sopho-more said students don’t have as much freedom to visit ofﬁ  cers for information.
“Hurry up and ﬁ  nish the Reitz 
Union,” he said.

Chris Walker (middle) watches from the bench during Florida’s 74-58 win against South Carolina on Jan. 8 in the O’Connell Center. Walker is expected to make his college debut against Missouri tonight at 9 p.m.
JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Staff Writer @jczupryn
In the 52 days since Chris Walker was admitted to Flor-
ida, he has been his own entity — isolated from the team 
and helpless to do anything about it. 
For 52 days, Walker was stuck in limbo waiting for the 
NCAA to pass down its judgment while his legend contin-ued to build in the media and the Gators’ fanbase.
But with Walker finally debuting tonight when No. 3 
Florida (19-2, 8-0 Southeastern Conference) takes on Mis-souri (16-5, 4-4 SEC) at 9 in the O’Connell Center, coach Billy Donovan hopes to close the curtains on the freshman drama and instead put the focus back on the team.
“I think there was a lot of attention on Chris because 
he was not part of our team, he was separated from our team,” Donovan said. 
“He’s now part of our team. There’s not our team and 
Chris Walker’s suspension. He’s now part of our team.”
Donovan continued by saying that although he does not 
want to take away anything from Walker and his first col-legiate game, the focus of the matchup should be the visit-ing Tigers and not a freshman who will come off the bench 
in a limited role on the squad.
“Right now, there should be no attention on Chris,” 
Donovan said. 
“I’m not trying to downplay Chris Walker. I’m excited 
for him, but this is not about him now. This is about our team.”
With Missouri having unusual height in its backcourt 
(all three starting guards are 6-foot-5 or higher), Walker 
may mean more to the team than expected.

In the early stages of the season, the 
new, fluid offense was supposed to be 
Florida’s strong point. 
Just past the halfway point of South-
eastern Conference play, those senti-ments have rung true. 
Compared to last season, the Gators 
are an offensive juggernaut. 
In 2012-13, Florida averaged 70.6 
points per game. Then-junior Jaterra Bonds led the team in scoring, averaging 13.1 points a game. 
This year’s Gators are scoring a torrid 
78.1 points per contest. Bonds is averag-ing 15.7 points per outing. However, both teams’ shooting per-
centages are virtually identical so how 
is there so much discrepancy among 
points?
The answer lies on 
the charity stripe. 
Florida has shown 
marked improvement on the foul line from last season. In 2012-13, the Gators were 11th in 
the SEC in free-throw 
percentage, shooting 
66.2 percent. This season, their 71.5 per-cent is good for third in the conference. 
However important free throws are, a Florida exceeding expectations 
during tough conference slate� GATORS HAVE THREE TIMES AS 
MANY 10S.
ERICA A. HERNANDEZ
Alligator Writer @EricaAlyssa 
Coach Rhonda Faehn has fewer and 
fewer changes to make to her squad as the 
season progresses.
The Gators are just one meet away from 
the halfway mark of the regular season, and 
her 2014 team has already outperformed her 
2013 NCAA National Champion squad. 
Florida’s latest victory against then-No.1 
Oklahoma only confirmed what Faehn and other members of the squad have been say-ing all season: This team is even better than last year’s title winner.
“We knew going in it was going to be 
our toughest challenge so far this season,” Faehn said. “Normally, I don’t look at rank-ings, but I think it was a great testing point at that time, No. 1 against No. 2.” 
Florida’s takedown of Oklahoma was 
UF’s third win against a top-ranked team since 2010.
“Our team 
really rose to the occasion,” Faehn said. “I think it was 
certainly our best overall competition as far as consistency.”
With three times the amount of perfect 
10s and consistently higher scores com-
pared to this time last season, there is no 
denying UF has momentum. Now it is a matter of maintaining that momentum and the health of UF’s gymnasts.UF eclipsing last year’s pace

LACROSSE
  EDEN OTERO
 Alligator Writer @edenotero_l
  The last time No. 4 Florida 
lacrosse went head-to-head 
with an opponent, it had 13 se-niors and shared an American Lacrosse Conference title.
  Saturday’s matchup against 
No. 1 North Carolina will be a much different picture than the team’s ﬁ  nal game of the 2013 sea-son.  With only two seniors and 11 freshmen, Florida is starting the season with a young team, leaving it to ﬁ  nd a new identity that doesn’t include Florida’s 
ﬁ  rst-generation lacrosse class.
  Coach Amanda O’Leary does 
not think the team will struggle 
from the inexperience because of the leadership of older play-ers, speciﬁ  cally seniors Cara Canington and Krista Grabher.
  “[They] have done an amaz-
ing job with our team cohesion 
and team bonding,” O’Leary 
said. “We have really come to-gether.”
    In Florida’s game against 
North Carolina on Feb. 9, 2013, the Gators came back from a 3-1 deﬁ  cit at halftime to defeat UNC 5-3.  It marked the ﬁ  rst time during the season that 
UF completed a come-from-
behind win and the ﬁ  rst time in four meetings that Florida beat North Carolina. 
 W ith the ﬁ  rst game of the 
season at UNC combined with a 
young team, UF has a steep hill 
to climb in their ﬁ  rst matchup of the season.  The Tar Heels, who are the 
reigning national champions af-ter ﬁ  nishing last season with an 18-3 season and a 4-1 record in Atlantic Coast Conference play, will be a tough test for Florida’s opener, but O’Leary believes the inexperienced team will im-press early on the road.
  “I think the challenges are 
we’re going to hit the road with a young team again and so it’s always a challenge, being on the road,” O’Leary said. “I think they’ve worked hard and we’re going to go into that game with a lot of conﬁ  dence.”
  Having junior All-American 
Shannon Gilroy, junior mid-ﬁ  elder Nora Berry and seniors Canington and Grabher to help lead the starting fresh-men through their ﬁ  rst college matchup will be advantageous to the team.
  “I think our freshmen are a 
talented group of young wom-
en,” O’Leary said. “They came 
in here highly-touted. We knew we needed them to step in im-mediately. They didn’t have time to adjust to college la-crosse. We threw them right in there, and they’ve responded.”
  However young the team is, 
O’Leary noted that inexperience 
would not be the team’s biggest 
challenge but rather working as one cohesive group.
  “I think team chemistry is a 
big part of our success,” O’Leary said. “So we preach a lot about that.” Gators look to start season strong despite lack of experience

Amanda O’Leary walks off the ﬁ  eld with then-junior Haydon Judge — who has since graduated — during halftime of 
Florida’s  20-4 win against Dartmouth on March 20, 2012. Florida has 11 freshman entering the 2014 season.
Faehn mentioned she plans on 
resting some of her athletes at the 
midway mark of the regular season, Friday’s away match against Ken-tucky. 
“We’re really looking forward to 
heading out to Kentucky and giving a little bit of an opportunity for some of our athletes to rest up a little bit,” Faehn said. 
“(We will) possibly change up 
some of our lineups and give other people some opportunity.” 
She said Mackenzie Caquatto 
likely will not compete on floor in an effort to rest her ankles and legs. In the 2013 season, as Caquatto battled injuries and soreness, she only exh-bitioned her floor routine once and did not compete it a single time in the regular or post season.
Resting some upperclassmen 
will make an opening for freshman Silvia Colussi-Pelaez to finally do more than just exhibition routines. 
“If she trains well this week, I 
don’t see why she wouldn’t be in the floor lineup,” Faehn said. 
Colussi-Pelaez has exhibitioned 
in all four events at least once, and she competed in floor for the first and only time so far this season on Jan. 17 against Auburn. 
Jamie Shisler may also be step-
ping up to the vault in the coming weeks.

size and strength to help the 
Gators in the paint, but he also has the speed and ath-
leticism to guard the Tigers’ 
backcourt players.
While playing at Holmes 
County High in Bonifay, 
Walker recorded 30 points, 
15 rebounds and seven blocks in Florida’s 1A state champi-onship.
Donovan knows the for-
mer McDonald’s All-Amer-ican has talent beyond the typical freshman. 
Donovan knows the for-
ward has the ball skills of a guard. 
But what he does not know 
yet is how comfortable Walk-er will be with the team’s 
plays and strategies, which 
Walker has had to learn in practice only. Donovan said Walker’s playing time de-
pends on how he adjusts.
“All those things that he does in getting into the game 
is going to be predicated on him knowing what he is do-ing and what he can do in terms of coverage on the de-
fensive end of the floor, what 
we’re running on offense, post defense and those types of things,” Donovan said. 
“He can be the best runner 
in the world, the best jumper in the world or the best re-bounder in the world, but if he can’t do the things inside 
a game plan of what we need 
to get done, then it becomes very difficult to play him.”
Senior Patric Young said 
he knows how Walker feels finally being able to play for the Gators after much antici-pation by fans. Like Walker, Young was also a highly tout-
ed big man with through-the-
roof potential when he was a freshman in 2010. 
And like Young, Walker is 
expected to bring energy to a packed O’Connell Center tonight.
“Just think about every-
thing he’s going through to 
get to this now, and it’s final-
ly here,” Young said. 
“It’s probably a 15 on a 
scale of one to 10 of how ex-
cited he is right now.”
team has to be in possession of the ball in 
order to shoot them. 
A more unforeseen improvement from 
last year has been the turnover margin. 
Last season, Florida was hovering 
around an even ratio. This year, it’s at +4.9 — good for fourth in the SEC. 
“We like to play fast, so there’s going to 
be turnovers,” coach Amanda Butler said. “That’s part of what we give up, want-ing to play that style of basketball. I think 
some of it is our opponents and maybe fac-
ing some folks that it wasn’t their objective to try and turn you over and create offense that way. 
“A lot of that is attributed to the fact 
that whoever we have on the floor, we’ve got two point guards at all times, and that helps us take care of the basketball.”
For a small team that is dead last in 
the SEC in both offensive and defensive rebounding percentage, as well as overall rebounding margin, the Gators find them-selves in a spot where they have to get the most out of their diminutive stature. 
If you cannot get the ball off the glass, 
take it before they shoot. 
Florida is third in the SEC in both forced turnovers and steals, which arguably com-pensates for the dearth of rebounding.
On Sunday, however, the Gators were 
even with the Rebels in the battle of the boards at 42 apiece. 
“That’s an area that’s no surprise that 
we struggle with occasionally,” Butler said. “Our goal is always just to neutralize that battle. We didn’t do that very well in the first half. I was able to go into the lock-er room and challenge our team’s tough-
ness, and specifically some individuals 
that we needed more from, and they really responded.”
The turnover margin again favored 
Florida on Sunday, opening the door for it to take more shots. Fortunately for Butler and her Gators, the shots were falling, as they have been during this current win-ning streak.
Before the streak, that was not the case.  Florida averaged 37.7 percent shooting 
from the field in its recent three-game skid, compared to 44.6 percent during its cur-
rent three-game run.  
The shots are falling again, but the game 
plan has remained the same.
“We have great shooters on this team 
that have just continued to work hard,” Butler said. “We encourage all our kids to take good shots. Sometimes, they’re going 
to go in. Sometimes they’re not, and when 
they don’t, that doesn’t mean you stop shooting or start doubting whether you 
should shoot or not. You just keep shoot-
ing good shots.”TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 15

  Tim Walton’s team has plenty of depth to 
start the 2014 season.
  After losing only two players to graduation 
— outﬁ  elder Kelsey Horton and utility player 
Ensley Gammel — the No. 4 Gators will fol-
low up their nation-leading 58-win season by 
returning 11 of 12 players who started at least 25 games in 2013 in addition to adding ﬁ  ve players to the roster.
  “We’ve got a great group of returning 
players with a lot of experience,” Walton said. “Still a young team, but a lot of experience.”
  In addition to returning all three pitchers 
from last season — senior Hannah Rogers 
and juniors Lauren Haeger and Alyssa Bache 
— Florida  has two new arms in the pitching 
circle.
  Freshman Delanie Gourley, the ﬁ  rst left-
handed pitcher that Walton has coached in 
his nine-year tenure as Florida’s head coach, is expected to make an immediate impact.
  “Typically, the left-handed pitcher neu-
tralizes the other team’s best hitters,” Walton said. “Most teams’ best hitters, by batting averages and statistical standpoints, will be a left-handed batter. So that’s really a nice 
neutralizer. She’s somebody who features multiple pitches … so Delanie deﬁ  nitely adds 
a totally different perspective on the game of softball. 
  “Left-handed pitchers are really hard to 
come by, especially good ones, and she’s one of the best we’ve ever had to recruit let alone coach.”
  Lindsey Spatola, a walk-on freshman, has 
looked good during practice but will probably not play much in the season, Walton said.
  “As of right now, we don’t anticipate her 
to get much game experience, but she’s really been a nice part of our team,” Walton said of the Jacksonville native. “She’s here. She’s working hard with us.”
  The rest of the newcomers, which include 
junior transfer Francesca Martinez and fresh-men Justine McLean and Chelsea Herndon, have also impressed Walton in their short amount of time with the team.
  McLean will start the season in center ﬁ  eld 
and will probably bat towards the end of the 
order, Walton said.
  Herndon, who started the fall playing in 
the inﬁ  eld,  moved to the outﬁ  eld once spring 
started.
  “Chelsea Herndon has really made a lot of 
strides, probably one of the most improved players on the team,” Walton said. 
  Despite the abilities they have shown in 
practice, Walton knows the freshmen still have room for improvement.  “The one thing they have to improve on is 
just being able to sustain, go a 7-inning game,” Walton said. “They’re going to have to sustain a long day, sustain getting out, being humble, success. … The season is long, and that’s one of the things they won’t be used to.” 16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 4, 2014

          Describing head coach Buddy Al-
exander as unhappy with Florida’s 
performance in the ﬁ  rst day of its season-opening tournament would be an understatement.
  “Really a disappointing day to-
day,” Alexander said in a release. “We have guys that are playing ex-tremely well and just didn’t do any-thing positive today.”  The Gators shot a combined 304 
(+16) Monday in the Sea Best Invi-tational in Ponte Vedra and are cur-
rently tied with Tennessee and Win-
throp for ﬁ  fth out of 16 teams.
  In his ﬁ  rst tournament as a Gator, 
sophomore transfer Richard Done-gan led the way for Florida on Day 1, shooting 73 (+1). He is tied for ninth place after the ﬁ  rst round.
  “Richard played OK his ﬁ  rst time 
out as a Gator,” Alexander said. “He 
was decent, but the other four played pretty poorly.” 
  Santiago Gavino, 
Ryan Orr, J.D. 
Tomlinson and 
Victor Tarnstrom all shot over par, ranging from two to 10 strokes.
  Alexander had 
been expecting 
better results.
  The Gators are accustomed to 
playing in Florida weather while other participating teams, such as Liberty and USC Upstate, have been practicing in colder, less humid tem-
peratures.
  But both teams are currently 
ranked ahead of the Gators, leading 
them by 13 and two strokes, respec-tively. 
  Florida also has the advantage 
of playing — and winning — at Sea Best before. It won back-to-back in-vitational titles in 2011 and 2012.
  The Gators have a lot of ground to make up today to match those ﬁ  nishes. They are nowhere near the championship numbers they put up 
in years past and sit at 13 strokes be-
hind leader Liberty. 
 The teams could not complete the 
scheduled 36 holes due to darkness, so UF will conclude the tournament with the remaining holes on today starting at 8 a.m. 
  “We have to ﬁ  nd a way to im-
prove and get this thing ﬁ  gured 
out,” Alexander said.
