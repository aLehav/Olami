THERE ARE MORE THAN 30 
COUNTY CASES 
By Stephany Matat and 
Alex De Luca
Alligator Staff Writers
UF announced seven new cases 
of COVID-19 in the university com-
munity, including six students and 
a faculty member.
The university quietly an-
nounced this on its COVID-19 FAQ 
website Sunday — the same site 
where it added information about 
COVID-19 cases when Gov. Ron De-
Santis announced UF had four posi-
tive cases last week. This brings the 
current number of UF cases to 11 as 
of Sunday night. 
These new cases include two 
graduate students from the College of Business, a law student, an em-
ployee from the College of Veteri-
nary Medicine, a student from the 
College of Health and Human Per-
formance, a student in the College 
of Journalism and Communications 
and a student in the College of Lib-
eral Arts and Sciences.
None of the students who were 
announced as positives for COV-
ID-19 lived on campus, according to 
the website.
The Alligator has reached out 
daily to UF Spokesperson Steve 
Orlando since Thursday and has 
received responses saying there are 
no known additional cases.
The Alligator received no re-
sponse Saturday. Orlando respond-
ed Sunday with a link to the website 
with Sunday’s new cases.
Orlando wrote that UF ﬁ  rst 
learned late Friday of one of the seven cases announced Sunday and 
university ofﬁ  cials learned of the 
most recent case Sunday morning.
Despite the website’s promise 
to post new cases “once a day, be-
fore noon, including Saturdays and 
Sundays,” this announcement was 
not published by noon Saturday, or 
at all, although UF knew of at least 
one new case. 
Orlando texted The Alligator 
Sunday afternoon saying it had 
taken UF some time to announce 
these cases because university staff 
wanted to create a logical and com-
prehensive way to provide the in-
formation. They decided on the new 
website, which took time to set up, 
and was launched Sunday.
No university-wide email about 
these new cases was sent over the 
weekend. When DeSantis made his 
statewide announcement, UF Presi-dent Kent Fuchs conﬁ  rmed four UF 
students had COVID-19 in a univer-
sity-wide email Tuesday.
The last university-wide email 
was sent Friday at 6:19 p.m. an-
nouncing all campus gyms and ﬁ  t-
ness centers, including UF’s South-
west Recreation Center, would be 
closed due to an executive order 
from DeSantis. The university also 
tweeted about the new website and 
its promises, but did not mention 
the new seven cases in its tweet.
The four students who were 
conﬁ  rmed on Tuesday included a 
student from the College of Arts, 
a student in the College of Liberal 
Arts and Sciences and two profes-
sional students from the College of 
Dentistry. All of these students live 
off-campus. 
Two of these students returned 
to Gainesville from domestic travel and were tested and quarantined, 
according to a web archive of UF’s 
COVID-19 website. One student 
returned to Gainesville from inter-
national travel and was tested and 
quarantined. One student was in 
close contact with an infected stu-
dent. None of the students were 
hospitalized as of Tuesday. 
Alachua County has 35 positive 
cases of COVID-19 as of Sunday 
evening, according to the Florida 
Department of Health. 
At 11 a.m., the department’s 
daily report listed four new cases: 
a 25-year-old female, a 33-year-
old male, a 22-year-old male and a 
23-year-old male. At 6 p.m., another 
ﬁ  ve cases were recorded: a 22-year-
old male, a 30-year-old female, a 
75-year-old male, a 37-year-old fe-

U.S. Sen. Rand Paul tests 
positive for COVID-19, 
forcing quarantines
Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky 
tested positive for COVID-19, 
becoming the first case of 
COVID-19 in the U.S. Senate 
and raising fears about the 
further transmission of the 
virus among Republicans at the 
Capitol. Paul is not showing any 
symptoms and is not aware of 
anyone he may have come into 
contact with who had the virus. 
At least five senators, including 
Paul, were in self-quarantine 
Sunday. Paul was criticized for 
appearing at Congress after he 
was tested and before he knew 
his results.
As COVID-19 crisis deepens, 
congressional rescue deal 
staggered
Top-level negotiations between 
Congress and the White House 
staggered Sunday over a 
nearly $1.4 trillion economic 
rescue package. The COVID-19 
pandemic has reached the U.S. 
Senate as U.S Sen. Rand Paul 
became the first member of 
the Senate to test positive for 
COVID-19 Sunday. All sides 
were hoping to agree on a 
plan to provide economic relief 
for the U.S. amid the crisis, 
but Democrats say the largely 
GOP-led effort does not go far 
enough to provide health care 
and unemployment aid for 
Americans.
New York quiets as it becomes 
a COVID-19 hot spot
An order requiring most New 
Yorkers to stay home from work 
and not gather in groups outside 
their families was set to go into 
effect Sunday in an attempt to 
slow a pandemic that has swept 
across the globe and threatened 
to make the state one of the 
world’s biggest COVID-19 hot 
spots. The order was slated 
to officially go into effect at 8 
p.m., but citizens were asked 
to begin following it Friday 
after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the order.  
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of 
the National Institute of Allergy 
and Infectious Diseases, said 
on “Face the Nation” on CBS 
that he does not expect crucial 
medical supplies to run out in 
the U.S and they will be directed 
to “hotspots that need it the 
most.”
Chaos, inconsistency mark 
launch of drive-thru 
COVID-19 testing
While there may be drive-
thru sites opening around the 
United States to make it faster 
and safer to test people for 
COVID-19, many of them have 
been delayed by inconsistencies 
as the pandemic grows stronger 
in the U.S. Drive-thru test sites 
have popped up in locations 
in more than 30 states — in 
state parks and parking lots, 
next to medical centers and 
universities, at the Mississippi 
State Fairgrounds and near 
where the Jacksonville Jaguars 
play. Despite this, however, 
they face numerous problems. 
Supply shortages have shut 
down drive-thrus in several 
states, including Colorado, 
New Mexico, Virginia, Florida, 
Louisiana, Alabama, North 
Carolina and Utah. One Las 
Vegas site was closed because 
it didn’t have enough workers.
COVID-19 mutes happy hours in 
senior haven, but golf goes on
In The Villages, a census-
designated area in Sumter 
County, Florida about an hour 
south of UF, numerous senior 
citizens are still golfing and 
socializing in plazas amid the 
COVID-19 pandemic. Despite 
this, however, there are 
measures being taken to prevent 
the spread of the virus into the 
community, whose average 
member is 72 years old. Starting 
Tuesday, all regularly scheduled 
indoor activities at The Villages 
were canceled through the end 
of the month. Pool activities 
were called off, and the library 
and fitness clubs closed their 
doors. Golf, however, is an exception, as the courses in The 
Villages remain open. Florida 
Gov. Ron DeSantis recently 
said state officials and UF have 
worked with executives of The 
Villages to expand COVID-19 
testing there and make 
contingency plans in case the 
retirement community has an 
outbreak.
During COVID-19 pandemic, 
priests master livestream at 
Gothic cathedral
Recent restrictions on gatherings 
in France to prevent the spread 
of COVID-19 have forced 
religious communities to adapt 
the way they express their faith. 
St. Vincent-de-Paul church in 
the heart of Marseille is one of 
those communities, and it now 
takes to livestreaming to deliver 
its services to members. More 
than 70 people watched its 
livestream on Sunday, and the 
service itself had eclipsed 500 
views on Facebook. “I already 
realize that the people who 
see us online are very happy 
to have this service, as a kind 
of comfort,” Father Philippe 
Rochas, a priest at the church, 
told The Associated Press. The 
service was open to a small few 
in person, however. Rochas 
decided to leave his church 
open for individuals to come 
and pray, for up to a maximum 
of 20 people, who must respect 
the social distancing measures 
and barriers put into place.
Croatia earthquake injures 
17 amid partial COVID-19 
lockdown
A strong earthquake in Croatia 
on Sunday caused panic, the 
evacuation of hospitals and 
widespread damage, including 
to the capital’s iconic cathedral, 
all amid a partial COVID-19 
lockdown. A 15-year-old girl 
was reported to be in critical 
condition and 16 others were 
injured, authorities said. The 
earthquake measured 5.3 
magnitude and struck a wide 
area north of the capital, Zagreb, 
at 6:23 a.m. Officials first said 
the 15-year-old had died, but 
doctors later announced that 
she was in critical condition and 
that they were fighting to save 
her life. They gave no immediate 
details on the extent of other 
injuries. The earthquake struck 
amid a partial lockdown of the 
capital because of the spread of 
the COVID-19. People were told 
to avoid public areas, such as 
parks and public squares, but 
had little choice as they fled 
their residences.VOLUME 114 ISSUE 72

THE VIRUS COULD ALSO 
AFFECT THE 2020 U.S. CENSUS
Staff Report
With more than 1,000 conﬁ  rmed 
cases of COVID-19 in Florida, 35 
in Alachua County and 11 at UF, 
students and Gainesville residents 
continue to adjust to virus-related 
changes. 
Here’s the latest local COVID-19 
updates:
Students studying abroad in 
Italy glad to be back
When UF canceled a Spring study 
abroad program in Italy due to CO-
VID-19 concerns, the students over-
seas unsuccessfully petitioned to stay. 
Now, at least two of these students 
admit that the university did what 
was best.
The Vincenza Institute of Archi-
tecture program participants wrote 
the petition because they not only 
wanted the “free will to decide” 
whether to stay in Italy, but they were 
also concerned about potentially ex-
posing others to the virus upon their 
return to the United States.
However, the COVID-19 out-
break worsened in both countries 
since then. Italy surpassed China as 
the country with the most coronavi-
rus deaths, and the conﬁ  rmed cases 
in the United States jumped from 34 
on Feb. 21 to more than 31,000 as of 
Sunday afternoon.
“Hindsight is deﬁ  nitely 20/20,” 
Alison Hochman, a 21-year-old UF 
architecture senior, said. “I’m very 
grateful to be back in the United 
States and to not be in Italy at this point.”
But Kerol Kaskaviqi, another one 
of the students in the program, said 
her experience transitioning back to 
normal wasn’t as easy. As an interna-
tional student from Albania, she ﬁ  rst 
had to travel from Italy back to her 
home country to receive necessary 
travel documents.
Although she said the program ter-
mination was “perfectly understand-
able,” the 23-year-old architecture 
senior said she disagreed with how 
quickly UF changed the messages in 
their statements.
Kaskaviqi said that what was once 
expressed in emails as an “encour-
aged self-quarantine for the students” 
became mandatory.
“If you promise something and 
then change it to say something else, 
it’s not really a promise,” Kaskaviqi 
said.
International students in 
campus housing ﬁ  nd it 
difﬁ  cult to leave
It seemed like everyone in Matina 
Mahasantipiya’s residence hall sud-
denly left. Within a day, it became a 
ghost town. 
UF President Kent Fuchs urged 
students to leave Gainesville after 
Gov. Ron DeSantis announced that 
four UF students tested positive for 
COVID-19. The university announced 
seven more cases in the UF commu-
nity Sunday — six students and one 
faculty member — bringing the total 
to 11. But for some, going home isn’t 
the best option or an option at all.
For Mahasantipiya, a 19-year-old 
UF computer science sophomore liv-
ing in Murphree Hall, home is Chiang 
Mai, Thailand. She has to carefully budget trips home because she relies 
ﬁ  nancially on scholarships, she said. 
“I was just worried about if I had 
to leave, then how would I do so,” 
she said. 
The U.S. State Department issued 
a Level 4 “do not travel” global ad-
visory Thursday, the agency’s top 
warning. It recommends that all U.S. 
citizens return home or stay where 
they are, according to the New York 
Times. 
Thailand requires people travel-
ing from China, Korea, Hong Kong, 
Macau, Italy and Iran to present 
proof of insurance coverage of at least 
$100,000 and that they tested nega-
tive before their trip, among other 
restrictions.
Emails from Mahasantipiya’s and 
her dorm’s resident assistant assuring 
the university wouldn’t force students 
to leave helped ease some of her wor-
ry, she said.
If the university shuts down and 
requires her to leave, she plans to stay 
with a friend in Florida. But some 
students don’t have that option, Ma-
hasantipiya said, and the university 
should help those students ﬁ  nd alter-
native housing off campus if it closes.
UF spokesperson Steve Orlando 
said the university will leave campus 
housing open, and additional funding 
will be allocated for the Aid-a-Gator 
program and the Field and Fork Pan-
try to help international students. 
Another UF student said he feels 
safe on campus now because every-
one has left.
Morteza Rostami, a 35-year-old 
mechanical engineering doctoral 
student from Iran, lives in Diamond 
Village, which is an apartment style 
on-campus housing facility.“I’m feeling good now,” he said.
But Rostami said he is worried 
about the future of the research he 
does on thermal cooling in the Na-
noscale Research Facility on campus, 
which supplies half of his ﬁ  nancial 
income.
The building is still open but much 
of the staff has left, Rostami said. He 
can’t continue the research on his 
own for long because he isn’t trained 
on all of the equipment.
Iranian authorities limited travel 
between major cities and suspended 
schools and major events, according 
to BBC. Iran has the fourth-highest 
number of cases in the world and the 
third highest number of deaths, ac-
cording to CNN.
Rostami can’t go to his country 
because the border is closed and he 
has work to do here, he said. He’s not 
going to leave.
Professionals fear COVID-19 
could lead to inaccurate census
The ripple effect of many UF stu-
dents ﬂ  eeing Gainesville due to the 
COVID-19 outbreak may trickle down 
to the 2020 U.S. census. 
Sean McLendon, the strategic ini-
tiatives manager for Alachua County, 
is concerned the sudden dispersion 
will hurt the accuracy of the census. 
Accurate counts provide sufﬁ  cient 
funding for schools, roads, emergen-
cy operations and recreation facilities, 
said Dorothy Zimmerman, a spokes-
person of the Bob Graham Center for 
Public Service.
During the 2010 census, the coun-
ty estimated that the populations of 
UF and Santa Fe College students 
were undercounted by more than 
23,000 people, which resulted in an estimated loss of $390 million in fed-
eral and state funding over the last 
decade, Zimmerman said. 
Historically, universities under-
count and perform poorly on the cen-
sus, Zimmerman said. That’s because 
college students fall under the hard-
to-count population since they are 
typically 18- to 29-years-old, an age 
group that is least likely to participate 
in the census, according to the Pew 
Research Center.
Originally, the county planned 
to reach college students by hosting 
events to encourage them to ﬁ  ll out 
the census questionnaire across the 
campuses. Because of the COVID-19 
pandemic, the census team will now 
be heavily dependent on reaching out 
to students through social media and 
email, McLendon said. 
But even with the suspension of 
in-person classes for the rest of the 
semester, UF and Santa Fe students 
should still be counted in the location 
they spend the majority of the year at, 
Zimmerman said. 
For the next couple of weeks, 
students are able to respond to the 
census online at my2020census.gov 
in a process that takes less than 10 
minutes, Zimmerman said. If they did 
not receive their 12-digit Census ID in 
the mail, they can choose the “do not 
have a Census ID” link and enter their 
Gainesville address. 
As of now, July 31 is the last day 
to self-report online, by mail or by 
phone, Zimmerman said. 
“This is a once in a lifetime oppor-
tunity to positively affect their legacy 
at the University of Florida,” Zimmer-
man said. 
Chasity Maynard, Stephany Matat, 
Samantha Chery and Valentina Botero 
contributed to this report.COVID-19 aﬀ  ects study abroad, international students in dorms
male and a 30-year-old female. 
The Alligator doesn’t have information 
about the names of these county and UF pa-
tients due to the Health Insurance Portabil-
ity and Accountability Act, more commonly 
known as HIPAA, which protects patient pri-
vacy. 
But while older adults seem to be some of 
the most at risk when it comes to COVID-19, 
42 percent of Alachua County’s cases are in 
their 20s, according to the daily report. 
Since Thursday, when the county recorded 
its ﬁ  rst positive case not linked to travel, the 
majority of reported cases have been listed as 
either unrelated to travel or unknown to be travel-related. 
Paul Myers, the administrator for the 
county’s department of health, said Saturday 
that community spread, or spreading of a vi-
rus from an unknown origin, is now occurring 
in Alachua County. 
The total number of positive cases in Flor-
ida has risen to more than 1,000 as of Sunday 
evening, with the majority of the state’s cases 
residing in the southern part of the state, as 
shown by the department’s dashboard. 
UF Health Shands Hospital also conﬁ  rmed 
it’s treating its second COVID-19 patient Sat-
urday afternoon.
The ﬁ  rst person to be treated at Shands 
for the virus was a patient from Georgia who 
was transported from another hospital, UF 
Health spokesperson Ken Garcia wrote in a March 11 email. The Georgia Department of 
Public Health was leading the investigation, 
he wrote. 
As of Saturday evening, a UF Health 
spokesperson couldn’t give details about the 
second patient, such as their age, travel his-
tory or gender. Garcia also could not provide 
many details on the condition of the ﬁ  rst pa-
tient.
Despite nationwide blood shortages, UF 
Health conﬁ  rmed that as of Saturday morning 
its hospitals are not experiencing these short-
ages or conserving blood.
In a county press release, Alachua County’s 
12th case was identiﬁ  ed as a day care center 
employee. As a result, the center is temporar-
ily closed for “thorough disinfection.” 
O2B Kids announced in a Facebook post Thursday evening a worker at its Hunters 
Crossing location at 4929 NW 43rd St. had 
tested presumptive positive for the virus. The 
location will remain closed this next week, 
the post read. 
In the post, they clariﬁ  ed that their other 
three locations — on Archer Road, in Mid-
town and near West Newberry Road — will 
remain open. 
“We have been asked by many parents, 
businesses, health professionals and child 
care agencies to remain open as child care 
centers are an essential component in our 
community’s response to this unprecedented 
crisis,” the post read.

Avenue Staff Writer
Happy Kiss Pole Fitness started 
with a pastel pink birthday card. 
Johanna Monserratte, 34-year-
old owner and lead instructor of 
the pole ﬁ  tness studio, received 
the card from her young niece, 
Isabella, in November 2013. In 
lowercase scribbles, the back of the card read, “happy kiss.” 
At the time, Monserratte was 
seeking a personal name for her 
upcoming pole ﬁ  tness business. 
When she read “happy kiss,” she 
knew it was the right ﬁ  t. 
The business began in March 
2014 in the 250-square-foot spare 
bedroom at Monserratte’s house 
in Gainesville. She had two poles 
installed into her home and curtained off the living room, dining 
room and kitchen. Students were 
greeted by her cat on the porch and 
practiced in the bedroom, spinning 
at Monserratte’s lead so as not to 
kick each other or the wall. 
As her business grew, 
Monserratte and her three 
instructors at the time relocated to 
a larger commercial space at 125 
NW 23 Ave. There, she set up nine 
poles, and slowly, the business 
grew.
During their classes, students 
warm up with aerobics, learn 
choreography from an instructor 
and practice the movements 
to upbeat music. Every day, 
Monserratte lights a scented candle 
to enhance the smell of the room.
 Through dance, Monserratte 
said that students can reﬂ  ect on 
and resolve any inner turmoil. 
“It’s not like everything is ﬁ  ne, 
but learning to accept feelings and 
ﬁ  nding ways that movement can 
help you navigate them,” she said. 
The studio has ﬂ  oor-length 
mirrors, which for many students 
can be intimidating. Even so, 
Monseratte said that the studio is 
a judgment-free zone.Instructor Marina Karin, 
a 33-year-old Gainesville 
resident, encourages students 
to look at themselves in the 
eye through the mirror. Karin 
began pole dancing in 2014 
and became an instructor in 
July of 2017. 
Karin largely attributes 
her personal development to 
pole dancing.
“For me coming into the 
pole dance community, it 
was really important that I 
had found this space that had 
allowed me to be sensual or to 
be intimate and to be sexual 
with my body in a space that 
was very safe and uplifting 
and encouraging,” she said. 
“And that’s not something I 
ﬁ  nd very often, especially as 
a woman.”
For months, Happy Kiss 
classes have had a waitlist. Now 
that the studio is closed as a 
safety precaution for COVID-19, 
Monserratte and the staff can focus 
on moving to a new location at 501 
NW 23 Ave., a few blocks from the 
old one, to expand the space and 
add more poles.
While the studio is closed, the 
instructors are hosting classes 
on Zoom. These classes include 
conditioning, ﬂ  exibility, twerk and 
FloorPlay.  Even though the times are 
uncertain, Monserratte ﬁ  nds an 
anchor in pole dancing.
 “I’ll always try to check in with 
myself and (say), ‘Hey, you know, 
pole dancing is supposed to be 
fun,’” she said. “I try to go back to 
that thought whenever things get 
stressful like they are right now.”

THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC HAS 
FORCED THEM TO BRING THEIR 
FIGHT TO A DIGITAL PLATFORM
Kaelyn Cassidy
Alligator Staff Writer
The Food Justice League was planning 
on protesting UF’s food service provider on Turlington Plaza this month. That was until 
concerns from COVID-19 stopped it. 
The league, which is a new coalition 
composed of six organizations, has 
canceled plans for protests in its fight to 
bring “sustainable and equitable food” to 
UF to limit COVID-19 exposure. Together, it 
released a list of demands for UF to include 
in its search for its new food service provider 
contract and are exploring options to make an impact virtually, said David Goldberg, a 
recent UF graduate and campus organizer 
for the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Organizations making up the coalition 
include the Alachua County Labor Coalition, 
the Farmworker Association of Florida, the 
National Resources Defense Council, the 
Young Democratic Socialists of America 
at UF, Working Food and the Agricultural 
Justice Project. 
The new food service provider contract 
is up for negotiation this summer.
The Alligator previously reported 
that UF’s current food service provider, 
Aramark, has been accused of wage theft 
and withholding benefits from employees. 
Nearly 50 people rallied outside President 
Fuchs’ office on Feb. 21 to protest the food 
service giant’s treatment of employees. 
The demands are listed in a letter to UF 
administration that the coalition published 
on its website. Among those listed are 
a $15 hourly pay for all employees, a 
20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions within two years from climate 
change intensive foods on the menu and a 
25 percent increase in purchases from local 
farms within five years.
“Food Justice League formed because we 
realized that all of our goals for the university 
could be streamlined into one food justice 
banner,” said Ashley Nguyen, who works 
for Alachua County Labor Coalition and is 
co-chair of Young Democratic Socialists of 
America at UF, “for not only workers, but 
everybody that’s responsible and has a role 
in the food system at UF.”With its March 10 protest canceled and 
as the pandemic continues to play out in 
the country, Goldberg said they’re looking 
toward digital ways to have their voices 
heard. 
“We’ve come to a point where social 
media has such a strong impact on corporate 
decisions,” Goldberg said. “A very loud 
voice, through whatever — it’s a digital one 
or a physical one, I think it’ll still have the 
same impact overall.”

Lily Strickland // Alligator Staff
Almost 50 protesters gather outside President Kent Fuchs’ office on Feb. 21 to 
advocate for better working conditions and wages from Aramark, UF’s food service 
company. A new coalition plans to protest virtually in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. 
Some demands listed by the Food 
Justice League
• $15 per hour for all employees
• Neutrality during any union 
organizing efforts
• Twenty percent reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions from climate 
change intensive foods within two years
• Twenty-five percent increase in 
purchases from local farms within five 
years
• One percent of contract profits 
invested to reduce barriers to local 
sources that can sell to UF food services
• Ensure health, safety, fair wages and 
right to organize for all supply chain 
workers from farm to plate
• Provide transparency in the form of 
a third-party, publicly available progress

If not for the COVID-19 pandemic sweeping the nation, this past weekend likely 
would have featured the most surprising and balanced opening weekend in 
recent NCAA tournament history. 
A quick look at Joe Lunardi’s Bracketology shows what could have been: 
Dayton as a one seed, San Diego State on the two line, a surging BYU team 
rising to a six seed, all while NCAA tournament mainstays North Carolina and 
Purdue would have missed the tournament altogether. 
This parity was pervasive since the season tipped off in November. Top-15 
teams Duke and Kentucky lost to Stephen F. Austin and Evansville respectively, 
former No. 1 Ohio State lost six of its ﬁ  rst eight in the Big Ten, and UCLA ﬁ  nished 
second in the Pac-12 after a dismal 7-6 start. 
And even after cancellations cascaded across the basketball landscape, fans 
still held out hope that a bracket would be released, allowing for months of theorizing and 
postulating before the season begins anew in the fall. 
These hopes were dashed by an announcement from NCAA senior vice president Dan Gavitt, 
who declared after days of deliberation, that the committee would not construct a bracket. 
“There is not an authentic way to produce tournament ﬁ  elds and brackets at this point 
without speculating, and that isn’t fair to the teams that would be positively or negatively 
impacted by manufacturing March Madness,” said Gavitt.
Given that nearly the entire college basketball season had been played and a majority of the 
one-bid conferences had completed its tournaments, the notion that releasing a bracket would 
be too speculative seems ridiculous to me. If the NCAA ultimately rules that seniors are ineligible for another season of 
play, which will likely be the case, it feels doubly cruel to deprive these players of 
the recognition they have earned this year
Gavitt’s decision ignores the importance of an NCAA tournament appearance 
to many schools across the nation. Gators Twitter was nearing DEFCON-1 at the 
prospect of a yearlong NCAA drought, but many schools around the nation were 
on the cusp of reaching the tournament for the ﬁ  rst time in decades. 
Rutgers was considered a virtual lock for the tournament, which would have 
marked its ﬁ  rst tournament appearance since 1991. Penn State was comfortably 
projected toward its ﬁ  rst selection since 2011 and Richmond likely would have 
ended a drought of the same length.
Recognition of success is particularly important to programs of this nature. 
With the threat of losing players to graduation and the NBA Draft, schools without consistently 
elite recruiting struggle to maintain continued prosperity. 
Dayton will likely be without three of its top ﬁ  ve scorers next season after its sensational 
29-3 campaign — two are graduating seniors and high-ﬂ  yer Obi Toppin is currently projected 
to be a lottery pick.
Penn State will lose its two senior leaders, Mike Watkins and Lamar Stevens, and will likely 
struggle to return to the upper echelon of the Big Ten.
For these programs and many more, where a tournament selection means so much and 
success is so rare, and for the fans who are starved of any college basketball content, they are 
right to take exception to the NCAA’s decision.The college basketball world deserved Selection Sunday this yearSuite Life on Declan
