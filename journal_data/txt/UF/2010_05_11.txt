LAND O' LAKES — Four years ago, a 
Tampa area high school freshman told his 
Spanish teacher he'd wear the same pair of sneakers every day until graduation.
 His toes stick out of the front and plastic 
bags encase the shoes on rainy days, but Ben Hedblom has made good on his promise. 
His teacher may have to shave his head 
and eyebrows if Hedblom holds on until graduation next month.
 The 17-year-old football captain said the bet has turned into more than a joke.
Hedblom said it helped him worry less 
about other people's perceptions and ended up inspiring his senior class project on the psychology behind perceptions.
Teacher Adrian Antonini left the school 
after the bet was made.
 In fact, he doesn't remember making 
it, but said he may shave his head via we-bcam.

On Saturday, the butterfly exhibit at the Florida 
Museum of Natural History was upstaged by the 
maggot exhibit.
CSI: Crime Scene Insects, an educational ex-
hibit that opened over the weekend, will remain in Gainesville until January.
Producers of the popular television show “CSI” 
contributed to the creation of the exhibit, said Paul Ramey, the assistant director of marketing and public relations for the museum.
The exhibit, which was partially sponsored with 
a $60,000 grant from Student Government, is not 
intended for the squeamish, said Douglas Noble, 
the assistant director for exhibits and public pro-grams at the museum. Graphic displays and pic-

More than a quarter of Alachua 
County residents have failed to prove 
they exist. 
As of Monday, 71 percent of Ala-
chua County residents have mailed in 
their census questionnaires. In 2000, the total mail-back participation was 
62 percent for Alachua County.
The 2010 census will determine the 
use of more than $400 billion of federal spending and the number of delegates 
in the U.S. House of Representatives, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s website.
On May 1, the Census Bureau be-
gan sending about 635,000 census enumerators to collect data door-to-door across America.According to Ivy Bell, an Ala-
chua County senior planner, this is the first year that the Census Bureau will not send a long form with the census questionnaire. 
In 2000, the long-form questionnaire 
was more than 50 questions long.
“[This year’s census] is 10 ques-
tions. It takes about 10 minutes to an-
swer them,” Bell said.

Although Southwest Rec-
reation Center has been under 
renovation since September, the construction’s recent devel-opments may be driving some 
gym-goers away.
Alandria Mustafa, a South-
west Rec employee, said that 
there has been a lot of disap-pointment about non-accessi-
ble showers since the center’s 
locker rooms closed on April 5. While Mustafa said that the new locker rooms will be an im-
provement to the facilities once 
they are completed, the current lack of locker rooms is respon-sible for students finding other gyms to use this summer.
The expansion, which is be-
ing funded by a $16.3 million dollar grant received in spring 2008, is scheduled to end in Au-
gust. 
The showers will remain 
closed until the beginning of 
the fall semester, 
according to the 
center’s website.
An exact num-
ber of the students affected by 
the renovation is difficult to de-
termine, Mustafa said, because 
precise numbers of locker-room users have never been kept.
The locker rooms’ closure is 
not the only change students 
will have to work around in the Makeover affects

Nebraska police nab 
alleged ‘toilet paper’ bandit 
LINCOLN, Neb. — Police 
said they suspect they’ve cap-tured the “toilet paper bandit.” A man who concealed his face 
by wrapping his head with 
toilet paper robbed a Lincoln convenience store last month. Police said the man was armed with a knife, but no one was hurt in the robbery.
He escaped on foot with an 
undisclosed amount of mon-ey.
Capt. David Beggs said 
29-year-old Joshua Nelson was arrested Saturday night. Beggs said a prescription pill bottle found near the store gave officers a clue to pursue. But he said it took until Satur-day for officers to find enough evidence for an arrest.
A jail spokeswoman said 
Nelson remained in custody on Monday. His attorney did not immediately return a call from The Associated Press.

Alligator wrestler bitten 
during performance 
NEW PORT RICHEY — An 
alligator wrestler bitten during a show is recovering in a hospi-tal.in Ripley for a reported armed robbery on Thursday. The man told officers that he had been walking on Route 225 when a 
car stopped and a someone put 
a gun to his head and demand-ed money. The man claimed to 
have complied and the suspects 
fled.
But as officers searched the 
area and noticed inconsisten-cies in his account, the man ad-
mitted fabricating the robbery 
story because he wanted a ride 
home.
He said his cell phone was 
out of minutes and 911 was the 
only number he could still call.
Officials say charges against the 
man are pending.

Minnesota city stops pro-
viding free doggie bags 
EDINA, Minn. — Need to 
scoop up after your pooch in the affluent Minneapolis sub-urb of Edina? You’ll now have 
to bring your own bag after the 
city stopped providing freebies. The Star Tribune reported Edi-na has been hit by thefts of city-provided dog poop bags, and also is looking to save money. So this year the city stopped providing the free bags at sta-tions in Edina parks.
Director of Parks and Rec-
reation John Keprios said park workers would fill dispensers in the morning and find them empty by noon.
Keprios said, “People walk 
up and take them until they’re gone.” He said it was “not just one isolated incident. It’s every-where and often.”
It cost about $12,000 a year to 
keep the dispensers full at the eight parks with the stations.

ON THE GULF OF MEXICO — 
A remote-controlled submarine shot 
a chemical dispersant into the maw of a massive undersea oil leak Mon-day, further evidence BP expects 
the gusher to keep erupting into the 
Gulf of Mexico for weeks or more.
Crews using the deep-sea robot 
attempted to thin the oil — which is rushing up from the seabed at a pace of about 210,000 gallons per day — after getting approval from the En-vironmental Protection Agency, BP PLC officials said.
Two previous tests were done 
to determine the potential impact on the environment, and the third round of spraying began early Mon-day and it will last 24 hours.
The EPA said in a statement the 
effects of the chemicals were still widely unknown.
BP engineers, casting about af-
ter an ice buildup thwarted their plan to siphon off most of the leak using a 100-ton containment box, pushed ahead with other potential short-term solutions, including us-ing a smaller box and injecting the leak with junk such as golf balls and pieces of tire to plug it. If it works, the well will be filled with mud and 
cement and abandoned.
However, none of these attempts 
has been tried so deep — about a 
mile down. Workers were simulta-neously drilling a relief well, the so-lution considered most permanent, but that was expected to take up to three months.
At least 4 million gallons were 
believed to have leaked since April 20. If the gusher continues unabated, it would surpass the Exxon Valdez disaster as the nation’s worst spill by Father’s Day.The engineers appear to be “try-
ing anything people can think of” to stop the leak, said Ed Overton, a LSU professor of environmental 
studies.
The new containment device 
is much smaller, about 4 feet in di-
ameter, 5 feet tall and weighing just under two tons, said Doug Suttles, BP PLC chief operating officer. Un-like the bigger box, it will be con-nected to a drill ship on the surface by a pipe-within-a-pipe when it’s 
lowered, which will allow crews to 
pump heated water and methanol to prevent the ice buildup.
Back on land, National Guard 
helicopters ferried loads of 1-ton sandbags to plug gaps in barrier is-lands that have been lapped at by a sheen of oil. 
The effort to bolster the islands 
was meant to safeguard the area’s vulnerable wetlands.
Authorities also planned to use 
south Louisiana’s system of locks and levees to release water to help keep the worst of the oil at sea.
“We’re trying to save thousands 
of acres of marsh here in this area, where the shrimp lay their eggs, 
where the fin fish lay their eggs, 
where the crabs come in and out,” said Chett Chiasson, executive di-rector of the Greater Lafourche Port Commission. “We’re trying to save a heritage, a way of life, a culture that we know here in recreational and commercial fishing.”
BP — which is responsible for 
the cleanup — said Monday the spill has cost it $350 million so far for immediate response, containment efforts, commitments to the Gulf Coast states, and settlements and federal costs. 
The company did not speculate 
on the final bill, which most analysts expect to run into tens of billions of 
dollars.
Above the oil leak, waves of dark 
brown and black sludge crashed 
into the support ship Joe Griffin. The fumes there were so intense that a crew member and an AP photog-rapher on board had to wear respi-rators while on deck.

For recent UF alumna Megan Kendzior, 
dancing is more than just a means of self-
expression.
This   year, Kendzior’s choreographed 
dance, “Witness,” was selected to be per-formed at the National College Dance Festival at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Perform-ing Arts in Washington, D.C., May 27 and 29.  
“Witness” is a collaborative dance among Kendzior and four other women and is set to the live musical accompaniment of Broadway accordion player Frank Ferraro.
To receive this opportunity, Kendzior’s 
dance was selected for the Gala Concert at the Central Regional Conference at the Uni-versity of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  
Kendzior’s creation was directly related to her research as part of the UF University 
Scholars Program.
The dance was inspired by her scholar-
ship-funded visit to Auschwitz 
concentration camp in Poland.  
“I use my dancing as a way to teach and carry on the story of 
the Holocaust,” she said. 
After her trip to Auschwitz, Kendzior felt 
a responsibility to show what she learned and continue the story of Holocaust victims.  
Kendzior’s work also won first place at the 
Spring 2010 Howard Hughes Medical Insti-
tute Celebration of Creativity in Arts and Sci-ences.
Kendzior graduated from the UF Col-
lege of Fine Arts with a bachelor’s in dance 
on April 30. During her tenure at UF, she 
was also a Student Government sena-tor and founder of Dance for My Suitcase, a student organization for dance majors.

LONDON (AP) — British Prime Minister 
Gordon Brown made a dramatic bid to keep 
his beleaguered Labour Party in power after it was punished in elections last week, announc-ing Monday he will resign by September at the latest even if the Liberal Democrats — being wooed by the Conservatives — decide to join his party in government.
The political theater, played out in front 
of the iconic black door of No. 10 Downing Street, comes as David Cameron’s Conserva-tives — which won the most seats in Parlia-ment but fell short of a majority — struggled in their attempts to win over the third-place 
Liberal Democrats.
Brown’s party has been willing to entertain 
supporting the Liberal Democrats’ demand 
for an overhaul of the voting system toward proportional representation, which would greatly increase that party’s future seat tallies. But the evening brought a further twist with a counteroffer from the Conservatives — a ref-erendum on a less dramatic type of electoral 
reform.
While uncertainty prevails, to the displea-
sure of the markets, one thing appears certain: 
The career of Brown — the Treasury chief who waited a decade in the wings for his chance to become prime minister — is winding to an end.
Brown, looking statesmanlike but resigned 
to political reality, accepted blame for Labour’s loss of 91 seats in last week’s election and its 
failure to win a parliamentary majority.
No other party won outright either, result-
ing in the first “hung Parliament” since 1974 
and triggering a frantic scramble between Brown’s Labour and the main opposition Conservatives to broker a coalition — or at least an informal partnership — with the Lib-eral Democrats.
“As leader of my party, I must accept that 
that is a judgment on me,” Brown said, offer-ing to step down before the party conference in September.
Brown said Liberal Democrat leader Nick 
Clegg had asked to begin formal coalition talks with the Labour Party and said he believed their parties might form a center-left alliance. Clegg had previously suggested Brown’s de-parture would likely be a condition of any 
deal with Labour.
The Liberal Democrats have seemed genu-
inely open to a deal with the Conservatives 
— who are less ideologically compatible with Clegg’s party than Labour is — largely out of a sense that Cameron won a moral mandate and supporting him was expected by the nation at a time of economic turmoil.
But Brown’s statement appeared to give 
Clegg’s party a viable alternative, and real temptation: join a possibly short-lived alli-
ance, remove the unpopular Brown and pass 
electoral reform that could transform their fortunes and even banish the Conservatives to the political wilderness for many years.
Belying morning optimism and buoyant 
statements by party spokesmen, the Liberal 
Democrats announced by the afternoon that they hadn’t yet reached an agree-
ment with Conservatives on 
education funding, fair tax-ation and electoral reform. Then came Brown’s offer.
Brown’s office said La-
bour’s legislators will meet Wednesday to discuss the 
status of negotiations with Clegg’s party — in-dicating that Britain may face at least two more 
days without an end to its political stalemate. 
Liberal Democrat spokesman Simon Hughes said earlier that a deal was unlikely within 24 hours but predicted “a government by the end of the week.”Brown said he hoped a new Labour leader 
would be appointed at the party’s annual con-vention in September. 
Foreign Secretary David Miliband and 
Education Secretary Ed Balls will likely be leading contenders to succeed Brown as party 
leader.
Brown’s announcement signals an end to 
a political career marked by great promise, 
considerable achievement and ultimate disap-pointment.
The 59-year-old politician spent a decade 
as Prime Minister Tony Blair’s treasury chief, but craved the top job himself and is widely believed to have negotiated a handover years 
ago. 
When he finally got it, in June 2007, he 
quickly found himself confronting an econom-
ic crisis, a divided party, and a parliamentary expenses scandal that fueled public disgust with politicians.
It was also a misfortune for Brown to fol-
low the charismatic Blair. He was brooding and awkward by comparison. A run-in with 
a voter at the end of the campaign — he called 
her “a bigoted woman” not knowing he was being recorded — seemed to confirm the cari-cature and plunged his campaign into a tragi-comic last-minute crisis.

� GODMOTHER-TO-BE HIT THE 
VICTIM, WHO WAS DRIVING.
By KATHERINE BEIN
Alligator Writer
 
The Gainesville Police Department 
arrested a godmother-to-be from Cit-
rus Springs for attacking her 6-months-
pregnant friend while the two were 
driving in west Gainesville early Sun-day.
Jessica Harris, 24, was riding in the 
passenger’s seat when the two got into an argument, according to a GPD re-port.
Harris, who had been drinking that 
night, became increasingly angered and attempted to pull the keys out of the ignition while the car was headed west on Newberry Road, the report 
stated.
As the driver pulled into a parking 
lot, Harris became physically violent, 
swinging her legs over the center con-
sole to kick her pregnant friend in the 
stomach, the report stated.During the scuffle, the driver was 
on the phone with a friend who told 
police he heard the woman say, “Don’t 
kick me in my stomach, you know I’m pregnant.”
When police arrived, they found 
bruises on the woman’s belly from the kick, as well as scratches on her arms and bodily fluids secreting from her 
genitals, the report 
stated.
The woman was 
then taken to the hos-pital by EMS workers, the report stated.
Harris lost an ar-
tificial toenail in the fight and her left in-
dex finger was found in the patrol car’s backseat, the report stated. 
After being read her rights, Harris 
said the driver hit her in the jaw and admitted to knowing the woman was pregnant, which is a special offense, 
the report stated.
Harris is charged with one count of 
aggravated battery on a pregnant fe-
male. The bail is set at $5,000.Pregnant woman beaten

The UF/Israel Dance Exchange is mak-
ing history. 
Eleven UF dance students, led by pro-
gram director Neta Pulvermacher, will 
spend three weeks studying dance along-side 30 Israeli peers.
On Thursday, the group will become the 
first UF study abroad program in the area of dance, as well as the first UF-sponsored study abroad program in Israel. 
“Israel’s modern-dance scene is consid-
ered right now to be the hottest place glob-
ally,” Pulvermacher said. “[It’s] the most 
innovative country right now as far as mod-ern dance goes.” 
Pulvermacher is excited about what cul-
tural education possibilities the program will provide its students. 
“It is so important for students at the University of Florida, or at any university 
really, to be exposed to and truly engaged 
with other cultures,” she said. “Everything in this world is now a hybrid of different cultures and ideas.” 
The students will travel to the Kibbutz 
Ga’aton in Northern Israel, which is also the home of the Kibbutz Contemporary Dance Company and the Mateh Asher School for the Performing Arts. The trip has personal 
meaning to Pulvermacher, who was born in Israel. 
“It’s really nice to take 
people where you come from, 
to take your students and share your cul-ture experientially with your students,” she 
said.
 Jeremy Miranda, a senior dance student, 
is excited to see how his peers will react to leaving the country for the first time. 
“It will be interesting to see how quickly 
their eyes will open to the possibilities and 
what else is out there,” he said. Dance students to study

Walmart hurts area
Poor Judge-ment
President Obama an-
nounced Elena Kagan as his nominee to re-
place Justice John Paul Ste-vens on the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday morning, calling her a “trailblazer,” among other things.
The president is sup-
posed to make sure the Supreme Court remains steady and insulated from the ebb and flow of Ameri-can politics, but we are not convinced Kagan is the right woman for the job.
Kagan worked as a law 
professor at the University of Chicago, was the first woman to be the dean of the Harvard Law School and has served as Solicitor Gen-eral since 2009, yet we can-not help but point out that she has no experience as a judge, federal or otherwise.
Sure, Earl Warren never 
spent a day in a robe until he became chief justice. And sure, he was fundamental in the outcomes of land-mark cases such as Brown v. Board of Education and Miranda v. Arizona, but he shifted the court’s politics so much that former presi-dent Dwight Eisenhower said nominating him was the “biggest damned-fool mistake I ever made.” 
At 50 years old, Kagan 
would be the youngest per-son on the Supreme Court, and her tenure could easily outlast those of the other justices. The last thing the 
court needs is an unknown 
quantity shaking up the sys-tem.
Confirming Kagan could 
be the best, worst or most unmemorable thing the Senate ever votes on, and it is impossible to know look-ing at her record. Just cross your fingers that Obama doesn’t have to borrow that quote from Eisenhower.In spite of the many people who live and work on 
13th Street, we could not be more ecstatic about the Gainesville City Commission’s vote to allow Walmart 
to abandon the old location and move forward with a su-percenter on 34th Street and U.S. 441.
Just look at the place. Its façade is passé, all the fluo-
rescent lighting has yellowed and the tile is so dingy that 
those welcome mats might as well scoot themselves in 
front of the exit. It’s time to knock it down and pave over it, or better yet, keep it standing as a reminder of how an-tiquated life was before the supercenter.
Never mind that it’s the anchor in the neighborhood’s 
economy, and forget all the customers it brings to all the businesses surrounding it. Those stores have had plenty of time to learn how to fend for themselves, and the training wheels had to come off someday.
We just wish other businesses would follow Walmart’s 
example and let their buildings slide into dereliction un-til it becomes convenient for them to cut and run. After all, we cannot expect them to keep the rollbacks coming if they have to factor in renovations and basic maintenance. 
All kidding aside, closing down the 13th Street Walmart 
will do immeasurable damage to the area and will likely cause a few other businesses to shut their doors as well. Yet it could easily outperform a supercenter at that loca-
tion if they slapped a new coat of paint on it and opened a 
third register once in a while.
Government shouldn’t force health care
During the next month, the Obama administration 
plans to release a new health care bill of rights, and the buzzword within appears to be “force.” 
The bill details how government is either forcing people to have coverage or forcing companies to cover them. For a country of free markets, there appears to be a growing number of limitations and rules.
Here’s the thing: Despite Republicans’ adamant pro-
tests against the nationalized system, they still want health care for every citizen. My dislike of the nationalized sys-tem does not stem from a desire for some to have access 
to health care and some not. I love my fellow citizens, and 
they deserve to be provided for if they cannot make it on 
their own.
The key here is “if they cannot make it on their own.” 
The current plan forces working citizens to provide help 
to people who might not need it. Like many government 
entitlement programs, it provides coverage for free-riders 
and people who would take advantage of the system with no oversight. Why? Because that’s how the government operates: no-budget, little-oversight programs that make politicians in power look good and pass the cost to citi-zens.
That said, we still need a solution. So, how do we pro-
vide for those who truly need help while keeping over-sight and accountability? We keep government out of the process.
If I were in office, I would work to support reform that 
provides tax incentives for the operation and support of private, nonprofit organizations working on a local level to support the needy. For example, I used to work for the United Way’s Loaned Executive Program. Its mission is to provide programs that support the community, ensure ac-countability and reduce dependency. Imagine that. Reduc-ing dependency is a novel concept to the government. 
One of the United Way’s pro-
grams focused on children’s dental 
work. It provided dental work for more than 1,000 chil-dren in an area school. Because tooth-related problems are the No. 1 reason for in-class distractions, this program pro-vides health care and builds futures for the participants, eventually allowing them to further their own charity work rather than depend on it.
If the government devoted even a fraction of the re-
sources to supporting nonprofits that is does to national-
ized health care, imagine what good could be done. We 
wouldn’t be accumulating uncontrollable debt with a plan like this, because it does not require the government to spend but simply reduces the tax burden on citizens who 
support nonprofits. With a tax cut, nonprofits could poten-
tially operate at lower costs and receive increased financial 
support. More could open, and every niche that the non-profit community could fill would be filled.
There would be certain areas where the government 
would have to step in. The health care system cannot entire-ly rely on private interests. But if we implement a system of programs specialized to local needs with accountability, oversight and supplemental efforts by the government, we could provide health care to citizens who cannot provide for themselves in a more adept and efficient manner.
The only trouble with this solution is getting the gov-
ernment to admit when it is unable to do something at op-timum efficiency. I wish the government would replace its favorite word, “force,” with “efficiency.” Then, we might have a sustainable health care system for those who need it.

Speaking OutTUESDAY, MAY 11, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 7
Students pay anywhere from $200 to $2,000 a month in rent, 
and what do we get in return? Apartments that are filthy and in disrepair. I had several issues during my tenancy at 
one particular community. For one, the management was un-willing to repair a broken window. I  requested to have it fixed 
every week for four months, but it never happened. When I 
returned from winter break there were dead bugs everywhere in my bedroom. That was my breaking point. I learned a lot from that experience and would like to share that knowledge with my fellow students.
Make sure you keep an accurate record of everything, espe-
cially all maintenence requests. Put a date on all records and, if possible, get someone else to sign and date them as well. I’m a picture person, so every time there’s an infraction I take a pic-
ture. Make sure to keep track of the actual maintenance request 
forms. When the maintenance staff leaves you that little carbon copy stating it “repaired” something, think of it as evidence in-stead of trash. 
Also, make sure you read the lease in its entirety and seek legal advice before signing it. Attorneys can be wonderful people when they work for you. They can tell you what that fine print means and how it can mean 
something else in certain situations. They can also tell you what 
your rights are as a tenant. If you are a full-time UF student, 
you are entitled to free legal advice from UF’s Student Legal Services. Three Rivers Legal Services, a non-profit organization that provides legal services to eligible people in North Florida, is another good resource. Visit their website at trls.org.
You can find landlord-tenant laws by looking up Florida 
Statutes chapter 83 online. You can also find information about landlord-tenant rights at the Floridabar.org. This is a great re-source, especially if managers at the community are refusing 
to do any future repairs simply because you filed a complaint. 
Their refusal may constitute retaliatory action, and you can file a complaint in a court of law.
If you think there is a housing code violation, call the 
Gainesville Code Enforcement Division at 352-334-5030. After discovering the dead bugs in my bedroom, I called them and reported my broken window. They set up an appointment to visit my apartment. They cited the complex for my complaint and other infractions that I wasn’t even aware of. Typically, re-pairs speed up after they contact management but if they aren’t 
made in a timely manner, management could be fined.
I admit I didn’t listen to my own advice when signing my 
lease. I assumed that I’d just look at apartment ratings online 
to see what previous tenants said about apartment complexes and then pick the place that was rated higher. I don’t recom-mend that now. 
My parting statement is directed at the management and 
office staff of “typical” college apartment communities: If you are having difficulty leasing apartments, continually need to 
offer residents “the special” or have disgruntled residents, do 
not make the mistake of attributing your increase in vacant apartment numbers to the economy. It is because of you that residents choose not to live there.

Construction on an expansion to the UF Southwest Recreation Center has resulted in the locker rooms being 
closed.
next few months. 
Intramural captain’s meetings will be held in the 
New Engineering Building, Room 202, and the Intramu-
ral Sports office was relocated to a  trailer outside of the 
center. The office will be open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.
Cardiovascular equipment was moved to basketball 
court No. 4 on Jan. 31. 
Three of the treadmills are available in the weight 
room, and the rest have been stored on a racquetball court because the basketball court does not have electricity to power them. 
The existing cardio room will be remodeled to house 
two massage therapy rooms, a personal training studio, an athletic training room and an assessment center.
According to the Department of Rec Sports website, 
the original entrance space will become a social lounge equipped with TVs, sofas and wireless Internet. The front entrance will also include a glass curtain wall, which will allow gym users to look out onto Hull Road while exer-cising.
At 140,000 square-feet, the facility will be 40 percent 
larger than the original structure. 
The new center will include an indoor, 1/9-mile track 
on the second floor.Locker rooms will be 
closed until Augusttures of dead bodies throughout the exhibit illustrate the role that insects can play in helping investigators determine when and where crimes occur.
The presence of fly larvae and 
eggs in a corpse, for example, can give investigators an idea of how long a person has been dead.   Other insects can also be helpful 
in solving crimes. Investigators in Texas recently convicted a murderer with the help of a dead grasshop-per that was found on the victim’s 
body. One of the insect’s detached 
legs was found in the pant cuff of 
the culprit. 
Museum curators hope the edgy 
exhibit will do something that few 
exhibits have done: attract students.  “When I was in college, I had in-
terests that didn’t correspond to go-
ing to museums,” Noble said with a laugh. 
When more students return to 
Gainesville for the 
fall semester, the mu-
seum’s marketing de-partment is planning 
a large campaign to promote the 
exhibit, Ramey said.  “The purpose of these exhibits is 
to engage an audience and be edu-
cational,” he said.
Death and decay are common 
themes for the museum this year. In 
addition to the CSI exhibit, a time-
lapse photography display of a de-
composing panther head will be exhibited during the fall semester, Ramey said. 
Starting in the fall, museum en-tomologists will also put decaying 
pig carcasses on display in the area 
behind the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. 
Despite the macabre nature of 
these exhibitions, the museum is a 
good place for students to take their 
significant others, Noble said.
“Coming here is a good first 
date,” he said with a laugh. “We’re 
pretty safe.”
to base their predictions on, said Stanley K. 
Smith, director of UF’s Bureau of Economic and Business Research.
“It also would affect a variety of statis-tics, such as when you calculate birth, death 
and crime rates,” Smith said. “Those are all 
based on population counts or estimates, so if you have inaccurate population counts or estimates, then you’ll have inaccurate mea-sures for these types of rates. It will give a very misleading idea about an area or popu-
lation.”
In addition to allocating funding and po-
litical representation, a higher participation 
in the census gives a more accurate picture of the U.S. population, he said.Janine Monfries, a second-year sociology 
student, said her dorm  required her to fill out the census questionnaire.
“[The census bureau] already [has] the 
commercials showing they are really trying to get the stragglers,” said Monfries.

�  Tiger Woods pulled out of the Players Championship over the weekend
because of a bulging disk in his neck. Consider it a win that he didn’t
leave because of another bulging body part. … Dallas Braden’s grandmother told A-Rod to “stick it” after he pitched a perfect game Sunday. He should just drop the issue now that he has done something notable with his career.� The UF women’s golf team and the la -

UF outfielder Francesca Enea celebrated Senior Day with her record-breaking 61st career home run. The left fielder also holds the Gators’ single-season home run mark with 20 round-trippers. 
� THE GATORS FINISHED 
SECOND IN THE SEC.

Every athlete’s Senior Day is spe-
cial, but Francesca Enea took it to a 
whole new level Sunday. 
Between capturing the SEC re-
cord with her 61st career home run, 
accepting a surprise marriage pro-
posal, and being honored alongside fellow senior Corrie Brooks before the game, the No. 6 Gators (42-7, 20-4 Southeastern Conference) 9-0 win over South Carolina (11-40, 1-27 SEC) was much more than just an-other game for Enea. 
“Just everything with Mother’s 
Day, my family being here, Senior Day, my engagement, it was just amazing,” Enea said. 
Prior to the game both Brooks 
and Enea walked onto the field with their parents, where their teammates presented them with flowers and each received the traditional framed jersey. 
As Brooks, Enea, their families 
and coach Tim Walton posed for a picture, Enea’s boyfriend Christian Bruey snuck up behind the group and immediately dropped to a knee. Enea wasted little time before saying yes. 
All in all, it was an emotional 
day for everyone involved, and it is clear that Brooks and Enea’s leader-ship will both be  missed come next season. 
“When you look at the two of 
them, they both played through in-jury, both played through pain, they both have changed positions, they 
both have brought a mentality and 
a work ethic, both were champions coming in to our program and both will leave as champions,” Walton said. 
“They both have just tremen-
dous, tremendous character and a lot of good things that they bring and we’re going to miss their lead-
ership qualities day-in and day-out, 
on and off the field.”Enea breaks SEC 
home run record
You have 15 seconds to translate UF 
doctorate student Andrew Charles Thoron’s thesis into plain English.
Here’s the title: “Effects of Inquiry-
Based Agriscience Instruction on Student 
Argumentation Skills, Scientific Reasoning 
and Student Achievement.”
You probably couldn’t do it. And you 
probably couldn’t do it because Thoron, like many doctorate students, was trained to make his work needlessly complicated.
But don’t blame Thoron. For all you 
know, he’s just like you – illegally down-loads music, wastes time on Facebook, 
watches ESPN.
And that’s the problem.
Sure, elitism is prevalent in the educa-
tion system’s highest levels. But it’s just as prevalent at the Worldwide Leader in Sports, a place supposedly sacred to the every man.
Hundreds of UF doctorate students 
wrote thesis papers in the weeks leading up to the NFL Draft. This isn’t a coinci-
dence. If you want to learn jargon, look no 
further than ESPN’s talking heads around draft time.Mel Kiper and 
Todd McShay are the company’s best ana-lysts, but they are also ESPN’s pseudo-lin-
guistic experts. And 
with the draft fin-ished, they now have time to co-author “From Ball Hawk to Tweener: The Upside 
of Talking like Us,” featuring a foreword by Jay Bilas. 
Here are some excerpts:
Ball Skills – Also known as “being able 
to catch a ball.” Example: Ted Ginn Jr. does 
not have ball skills. 
Body Catcher –  1: A player who can’t 
catch the ball with his hands. Example: Not only does Ted Ginn Jr. not have ball skills, he isn’t even a body catcher. 2: A murder-er.
Football IQ – How well a player un-
derstands the sport of football. Note: Pro-
fessional football players and future pro Confusion is the key to success

Billy Donovan’s squad will have 
a familiar look to it this upcoming 
year.
The Gators will return all five 
starters next season after rising se-nior Alex Tyus withdrew his name from the NBA Draft on Saturday.
He announced the return on his 
Twitter account.
“I will be returning to gator na-
tion!! Let’s get ready to make a run boys!!!” Tyus said.
The power forward started every 
game last season while averaging 11.8 points on 50.3 percent shooting and grabbing 6.9 rebounds per game.Tyus took a slight step back from his sophomore year when he put up more than 12 points per game on 59 percent shooting.
“When I began this process it was with the intent of gathering information to see what I needed to work on to one day compete at the next level, and I believe I have been successful in doing just that,” Tyus said in a statement.  
“I have withdrawn my name from the NBA Draft and look forward to com-
pleting my senior year at the Univer-sity of Florida. We made tremendous strides as a team a year ago that I look 
forward to continu-ing to build upon.”
ESPN’s Chad 
Ford had rated Tyus anywhere from a second-round pick to being un-drafted.
He would have joined Marreese 
Speights and Nick Calathes as the third Gator in as many years to de-clare for the NBA Draft before their senior season.UF BASKETBALLTyus to return to UF

Although the pregame festivities 
greatly overshadowed what was to 
come, the series finale against the Gamecocks resulted in another one-sided victory for UF. 
The Gators continued to domi-
nate offensively, and once again the long ball was a key component in their success. 
In the bottom of the third, with 
her team already leading 3-0, Enea took an inside pitch deep to left for 
her 61st career home run, moving 
her past Kelly Kretschman for the SEC all-time lead. 
“It makes me happy, I feel good 
about it,” Enea said. “I wasn’t sure how I was going to be at the col-
legiate level, espe-cially after a tough freshman year, so it just makes me feel 
good that I was able 
to bounce back from that bad year.”
Freshman Kelsey Horton contin-
ued the trend by delivering her fifth home run in only 31 career at-bats in the bottom of the fifth, stretching the lead to nine and thus securing a run-rule victory. 
Florida ace Stephanie Brombach-
er got the win in the circle, allowing just one hit in her five-inning com-plete-game shutout. 
The junior has now pitched 30.2 
consecutive frames without allow-ing an earned run and has only sur-rendered a single hit in her last 11 innings of work. 
“I think it’s important for me to 
be feeling confident in my pitches,” 
Brombacher said. “I still need to 
work on some things and get a few pitches right where I want them, so I’m excited that I’m in this groove but I know I still need to get better.”
Brombacher pushes consecutive-scoreless streak to 30.2 innings
football players usually have high Football IQs. 
Motor – This word doesn’t actually mean 
anything. It’s just fun to say. Example: Look at Ndamukong Suh’s motor! I haven’t seen 
a motor like that since I saw Jevon Kearse’s 
motor. And, boy, did he have a great mo-tor.
Waist Bender – A straight man’s excuse to use a homoerotic term when discussing an athlete. See also: Fluid Hips, Quick Hip Snap, Open Hips, Country Cock Strong.
And, because the NBA Draft is just a 
little more than a month away, don’t skip Bilas’ foreword, featuring words such as: 
Considerable Linear Extent in Space – 
Tall.
Popability – A basketball player’s ability 
to surprise the defense by shooting.
Second Jumpability – You’ll have to wait 
for the actual book for this one because no-body outside of Bilas knows the definition. Whatever second jumpability is, Miami Heat forward Michael Beasley apparently has it in spades.
Bilas using ridiculous terms like “con-
siderable linear extent in space” is akin to Thoron saying “Inquiry-Based Agriscience Instruction.” For some reason, they justify their work by using as many syllables as 
possible. 
Instead, they should focus on simplify-
ing their work to reach common people.  The theme of Thoron’s paper was teach-
ing students about using science on farms. 
Kiper, McShay and Bilas talk about sports for a living. Neither topic should be com-plicated.
But, looking at the hundreds of thesis 
papers written by UF doctorate students this spring, it is clear they are prepared for a world filled with long-winded words. 
And they are not alone.
You, too, can become an elitist if you 
want. Just keep watching “SportsCenter.”SOFTBALL , from page 14
