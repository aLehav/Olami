Jay Rosen makes collages inspired 
by dada art in his spare time.
“I like to take things apart and cre-
ate something new,” the 25-year-old 
UF ﬁ  ne arts alumnus said. “I take magazines from the 1960s and I cut them up and make new imagery from 
the news.”
The art gallery at the Hippodrome 
State Theatre, located at 25 SE Sec-
ond Place, opened its ﬁ  rst-ever dada art collection today. The exhibit, ﬁ  lled with art created by Gainesville locals, will run through May 29.
Dada art originated in 1916 and 
“challenged the concept of what con-stitutes a work of art and its aesthetic value,” according to the exhibit’s 
Facebook page.
“It’s very politically charged,” 
Rosen said.
Jessica Hurov, the managing di-
rector for the Hippodrome, said the displays are comprised of diverse cre-
ations.
“We hope their work sparks cre-ative drive and gives people food for thought,” she said.
She said the gallery has 25 pieces 
of artwork, and 24 other pieces will be on display at the gallery at Oak Ham-mock, located at 5100 SW 25th Blvd., from April 11 to July 9.  
“The Hippodrome is displaying all 
the sculptural and 3D pieces,” Hurov said. “We also have some hanging pieces.”
Casey Wooster, a 23-year-old UF 
museum studies master’s student, said she is passionate about the dada movement. 
“I love that art can say so much 
without saying anything at all,” she said.  Local gallery features dada art genreBy Katelyn Newberg

President Fuchs told UF’s Board of Trustees he worries 
about students’ health Friday morning. 
Committees summarized UF’s accomplishments during 
the 2014-2015 academic year on the second day of the board meeting. It started Thursday and continued Friday. 
Fuchs gave his own report, choosing to discuss students’ 
mental health and how UF has handled the increased demand 
for mental health services.
He said the Counseling & Wellness Center needs four coun-
selors and the Dean of Students Ofﬁ  ce Care Team needs two 
more staff members. The Student Health Care Center also needs an additional psychiatrist. 
“This is an area in every university in the nation where 
there’s growing demand,” Fuchs said. 
Other UF administrators gave presentations about students’ 
mental health and how their departments are addressing it. 
Jen Day Shaw, UF’s associate vice president and dean of 
students, said she wants students to use campus mental health resources.
“Everybody knows that it is part of their responsibility to 
look after the well being of students,” she said. 
Steven Scott, the Board of Trustees’ chairman, said the 
group’s next meeting will be his last as chairman. He said he will remain on the Board of Trustees for a brief period of time. He did not say who would replace him as chairman. 
The Board of Trustees also passed a resolution to rename 
the Herbert Wertheim Engineering Building to the Herbert Wertheim Laboratory for Engineering Excellence.Board discusses

Despite pouring rain, hundreds showed up to learn about insects 
Saturday.
About 400 people attended the UF Entomology Club’s annual 
BugFest in Steinmetz Hall. This was the second-highest turnout 
since the event began in 2012, said Evan Waite, the event coordina-
tor for the club.
The event was sponsored by Student Government, the UF ento-
mology junior said. It cost $350, including $250 for supplies and 
$100 for advertising.
This year’s theme was “Around the World in 80 Bugs.” Orga-
nizers divided the entomology building into continents, with each featuring the bugs found there.
Activities in each area included honey tasting, educational dis-
plays, cockroach racing and cricket spitting, where contestants spat 
frozen crickets into targets.
Carl Barfield, a retired UF entomology professor, said he first 
came up with the idea to host BugFest.
“Nothing like this ever existed before,” he said.
Waite said the volunteers started planning the event in Septem-
ber 2015, when they came up with the theme.
The event became open to the public two years ago, Waite said. 
Before, it was an open house for the entomology department.
Families and Alachua County students attended the event, the 
20-year-old said. The entomology club sent fliers to science teachers in schools, Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts.
“For some reason, little kids really like bugs,” Waite said. “There 
is no reason why we can’t foster the interest in entomology.”
Waite said he hopes events like this get rid of negative percep-
tions of insects.
“If we don’t expose kids to bugs early, we get the reaction we 
get 90 percent of the time which is, ‘I am going to kill that thing,’” he said.
Katherine Tran, a UF environmental engineering senior, tasted 
hummus made out of mealworms.
“It was nothing too weird, actually,” the 23-year-old said. “You 
should do it just once for the experience.”

IT WAS FOR 
INTRODUCE A GIRL 
TO ENGINEERING DAY.
By Brian Dusape
Alligator Contributing Writer
Middle-schoolers built bridges 
and robots at UF on Friday.
More than 50 Kanapaha Middle 
School students visited UF for the 
UF Society of Women Engineers’ an-nual Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day. 
During the free event, visiting 
girls were divided into two groups, and each group worked on three lab activities at the Reitz Union and Weil Hall.
The Reitz Union group created 
“bristle bots,” making robots from toothbrush heads, magnets and tape. 
At Weil Hall, the group built lava 
lamps and pop rockets and tried 3D printing.
Janet Wisby, a seventh-grade life 
science teacher at the middle school, said she’s brought her girls to par-
ticipate for more than nine years.
Wisby said she wants her girls to 
know they can be engineers.
“We know that engineering is a 
male-dominated field, so we have 
this event to expose them to any possible careers that they might be interested in for the future,” she said.
Heather Lucas, a station coordi-
nator for the event, said she wanted to introduce girls to engineering be-cause it allows them to learn about 
the field.  
“I’ve noticed there are hardly 
any females in my college since I 
transferred to the university,” the 21-year-old UF mechanical engineer-
ing senior said.
Ashley Quigley, one of Wisby’s 
students, said she’s interested in en-
gineering.
She said her favorite activity was 
making robots out of toothbrush heads, batteries and tape.
Quigley, who won last year’s Ala-
chua State Science Fair in Lakeland, 
Florida, said she wants to continue 
engineering at this year’s fair.
“I’d be really excited to go again,” 
she said. “Last year I was able to 
make a bunch of friends.”  
Nola Wit, a Kanapaha middle-
schooler, said her favorite activity 
was the civil bridge design, in which she made different types of bridges out of wooden sticks and rubber 
bands.
“Back in my old school, we used 
to have chemistry, physics and biol-
ogy,” she said. “I really like learning about stars and robots.”Middle-

UF students surrounded the 
stage as a Pakistani pop artist sang 
Justin Bieber and Pakistani songs Saturday night.
Asim Azhar, an emerging pop 
artist from Pakistan, performed at the UF Pakistani Students’ Associ-ation’s 20th annual cultural show for the first time. Students listened to music and watched traditional Pakistani dances at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.
About 300 people attended 
the event, which cost between $12,000 and $14,000, to learn about Pakistan, said Haider Ali, 
the president of PSA. Volunteers 
from International Student Affairs funded it, Ali said.
PSA members have rehearsed 
for the show since the beginning of Spring, he said.
“We shared the culture of 
Pakistan with those who might not know about it,” the 22-year-old UF nutritional sciences senior said.
Ali said he wanted to showcase 
Pakistan’s beauty. Other UF clubs also performed traditional Paki-stani dances.
“It’s not just the old country that people think, you know, with dirt roads and poverty,” Ali said.
More than 85 people also 
donned long, colorful pants, vests and dresses during a fashion show. The traditional Pakistani outfits are known as salwar ka-meez.Later, Akbar Chaudry, a 
25-year-old UF aerospace engi-neering first-year graduate stu-
dent, performed stand-up com-
edy. He joked about stereotypes, such as how all Pakistani parents expect their children to be doctors.
Zachary Sandoval, a UF biol-ogy freshman, said he enjoyed the energy of the show.
“It’s about them showing ele-
ments of their own culture that they feel make them special,” the 19-year-old said.
Ali said he was proud of the 
show.
“You can see when people are 
out there on the stage, they’re having so much fun,” he said.

A Williston, Florida, man was arrested 
Friday night after police said he stole $30 
worth of deodorant from a Walgreens and then broke into a house.
At about 8:44 p.m., Nathaniel Shameik 
Walters, 46, shoplifted about 15 sticks of Suave deodorant from the Walgreens on East University Avenue and hid them in the front of his pants, according to a po-lice report.
A store employee tried to block Wal-
ters, who then pushed through the front door and ran away, according to the re-port.
Police dogs eventually tracked him to 
a woman’s home in the 1400 block of NE First Ave., according to the report.
Ofﬁ  cers entered the home but could not 
see Walters, who ignored their commands to come forward, according to the report.Soon after, a police dog attacked Wal-
ters as he smoked crack in a back room, according to the report. He was later treat-
ed for his injuries at UF Health Shands Hospital.
Walters told police 
he stole the deodorant sticks and sold them to the “corner store” before buying crack from the “DVD man,” according 
to the report.
Police arrested Wal-
ters on charges of larceny, petty theft, burglary and resisting an ofﬁ  cer without violence, according to Alachua County court records.
Authorities took Walters to the Alachua 
County Jail, where, as of press time, he remains in lieu of a $15,000 bond.

A Jacksonville, Florida, man was arrested 
on State Road 93 on Friday night after depu-
ties said he drove drunk with three small children in the back seat.
At about 10:40 p.m., deputies with the 
Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce received multiple calls about a reckless driver, accord-ing to an arrest report. Callers said the man drove onto curbs and nearly collided with another driver, according to an arrest report.
Soon after, deputies stopped Cody Eugene 
Hillbrand, 30, for driving without taillights and not having a license plate, according to an arrest report.
Deputies walked toward Hillbrand, who 
staggered out of the car with his pants un-zipped, covered in what appeared to be urine, according to the report.
Deputies found spilled beer on the driv-
er’s side ﬂ  oor mat of Hillbrand’s car. In the back seat, they noticed Hillbrand’s three small children, whose ages are unknown, according to the report.
The eldest daughter 
told authorities Hillbrand had been speeding and driving on curbs, and that she tried climbing into the passenger’s seat to stop him, according to the re-port.
She said Hillbrand 
drank up to four beers 
about an hour before deputies pulled him over, according to the report.
Deputies arrested him on three charges of 
child neglect and one charge of DUI. 
Authorities took him to the Alachua 
County Jail, where, as of press time, he was released on a $25,000 bond.

Summer class 
requirements need 
to be revisited
With less than three weeks left of classes for the se-
mester, some of you are getting ready to head home, backpack through Europe or earn some cash with a summer job. But there is an unfortunate group of Gators stuck in Gainesville (or attending another state 
university as a transient student) to fulﬁ  ll the state requirement of Summer semester classes. A moment of silence, please.
Now, we at the Alligator are not saying summer in Gainesville 
is entirely awful. But what totally sucks about summer isn’t ex-tra-long classes, blistering heat or freezing-cold classrooms, but rather the fact that Bright Futures doesn’t cover tuition for sum-mer classes — classes we are required to take.
Currently, every student who attends a Florida state univer-
sity is required to take nine credits during the summer in order 
to graduate. We get it: The state wants to ﬁ  nd a way to ensure 
attendance during Summer classes doesn’t completely plummet. But not only is it absolute malarky to force us to take classes in the summer when we could be taking advantage of study-abroad or internship opportunities, it’s ridiculous these classes are not covered by Bright Futures.
College is hard. It’s even harder when you have to pay your 
way through school, especially when some ﬁ  nancial help, such as Bright Futures, doesn’t cover everything. With each credit 
costing $212.71, that’ll cost you $1,914.39 in tuition for nine cred-
its during the summer, according to the Fall 2015-2016 cost of attendance. And that’s not including all the books, food and rent you’ll have to pay for the summer, considering most apartment complexes in Gainesville require yearlong leases — but that’s a complaint for a different day.
The only students allowed to receive Bright Futures beneﬁ  ts 
during the Summer are those in the Innovation Academy. For these students, the Fall semester functions as a traditional Sum-
mer semester. However, the Innovation Academy does not re-
quire its students to take classes during the Fall, speciﬁ  cally so they can take advantage of opportunities for internships, study abroad, etc. Funny how that works.
State universities, or at least UF, clearly understand the ad-
vantages to having a semester off to pursue extracurricular inter-ests or professional development, as evidenced by the Innovation Academy’s structure. However, why doesn’t this apply to more traditional students? The answer, it would seem, is purely a ﬁ  -
nancial one.
Of course we understand that at the core, universities are 
businesses, and businesses by deﬁ  nition need to make money. 
But the universities don’t technically stand to lose anything be-cause the money funding Bright Futures comes from the state. So it seems to us that institutions supposedly existing to provide an education for all pupils, regardless of background or income, should not require academically excellent in-state students to pay out of pocket for a semester that isn’t even necessary to graduate 
in most cases.
We would love to suggest Bright Futures cover Summer se-
mester classes, but we understand the impracticality of this. With 
the amount of money awarded by Bright Futures already shrink-ing, adding another semester of study to cover for thousands of students would be unreasonable. So if that option is off the table, universities need to adapt and revise the Summer semester re-quirement policy. In a ﬁ  nancial world where many students need all the help they can get, being forced to pay out of pocket for a 
required, and sometimes unnecessary, semester is unfair.France’s invisible protests, defending paradise
They shut down the school Thursday. They 
shut it down the Thursday before, too, and the Thursday before that. They stack desks and chairs in front of the doors — canary yellow paint and pine, legs round-
ed like children’s handwriting. They scrawl signs in green and red and blue, in jaunty all-caps of acrylic. They tape a sign that says “Life’s an ap-ple, the labor law’s a worm.” I think, “Life’s an apple,” and nudge the chairs from the handle.
The government’s perplexed: Unemploy-
ment’s at 10 percent, and they complain about capping severance pay and negotiating a few hours past 35 a week? Long-term contracts are terrifying, the government says: 
That’s why you youths are stuck in short-term garbage. They 
assure me it’s bullshit.
Thursday one: Latin American literature is sliced in half 
for the protests. The students unwrap tuna sandwiches and croissants in class. They’re breaking at noon; the mood is festive. The professor asks me to go, and I say I don’t think 40-hour weeks are evil: “It’s paradise here.” 
“We must defend paradise,” he says, and his lips curl 
into dimples. He likes it. He repeats it. The most vibrant and 
vocal student hands me a ﬂ  ier: “I understand that you are 
American, but we have different realities.” Two different re-alities: I like how that sounds. In America, we ﬂ  oat belly up.
Thursday two: “They blocked the building and shut down 
the cafeteria, but they got free mufﬁ  ns!” a girl says. We squat on the lawn while the communists debate about canceling classes. She ﬁ  lters the megaphone blur to me and reapplies her lipstick. “It’s bullshit,” she says: “Politics is fashion. But the law’s shit.” There’s a ﬁ  re behind us. “They’re just bar-
becuing.”
Thursday three: National strike. The school library’s shut 
down, the city library’s shut down, so I buy tank tops. I 
deliberate between pink and peach. I walk to the Franco-American Institute. They smash empty wine bottles on the quai. They wear bandanas and bombers and throw rocks at passing tires. The police look like tortoises.
Ensconced in walnut and leather, I watch the windows blacken and a stampede hurtle down the boule-vard. They smash storefronts. The police throw smoke bombs — I hear — and tear gas. They throw tear gas and cobblestones back. The bour-geoisie pull their drapes. Rocks batter the roof.
“It’s disgusting,” the secretary says, her blue 
eyes glassy and pale in the sun. “I’m against the law, of course. Precariousness. Young people need jobs, but real jobs.” This is what the gov-ernment is promising.
“But these protestors discredit the movement. 
We always protest, and the government doesn’t care any-more.” The light catches her glasses and large teeth. “I’m sorry if I’ve offended you,” she says.
High-schoolers race through smoke, pulling tacky sweat-
ers over their mouths, green Adidas slapping the esplanade. “You Americans are more liberal,” she says. “We’re quite conservative here.” She says “groups” pay kids to get vio-lent. When the metro reopens, I hear a toddler shout, “Wow! It’s the police!”
They’re mobilized. They’re vigilant. You never see this 
in America. In 1968, their signs said, “Make love, not war!” Now they say, “Make love, not extra hours!” And others tell 
me that there’s no point to voting if the socialists can do this. 
Others tell me you can’t trust anyone. Others tell me that France is over.
Posters of cartoon eyes warn you of the state of emergen-
cy. Red block letters scream, “VIVE LA COMMUNE.” They wave yellow and red and blue and purple ﬂ  ags that no one can tell you the meaning of. They throw chairs on the sub-way tracks. I don’t know why.
The university’s lunar hellscape of high rises bristles with 
excitement. It feels political, however that feels. Like a child of the Depression, I want them to suffer as much as us Amer-icans, suffocating six or seven endless days a week, fungible, forgettable.
And yet this feels like the end of something: the end of 
paradise.

Forty-eight years ago this month, on 
April 11, 1968, President Lyndon Johnson signed the federal Fair Hous-
ing Act, which prohibited discrimina-
tion concerning the sale, rental and 
ﬁ  nancing of housing based on race, reli-gion, national origin, sex, handicap and 
family status. This important act also made 
it unlawful for a housing provider to make, print or publish any statement or adver-tisement that states a preference based on these classes.
Every April, people across the U.S. are 
encouraged to learn more about their rights and responsibilities under the Fair Hous-ing Act as a part of National Fair Hous-ing Month.  This year’s theme — “Shared Opportunity in Every Community” — urges all citizens 
to reach out to their communi-
ties and help those who are seek-ing to rent, own, buy or insure a home and educate them about 
their fair housing rights and how 
to take action if they suspect dis-crimination.
The Florida Commission on 
Human Relations (FCHR) is your state 
agency charged with investigating cases of 
housing discrimination.  Last year alone, the FCHR investigated and resolved 185 cases where housing discrimination was alleged. Even with the passage of the federal act and the Florida Fair Housing Act in 1983, dis-
crimination in housing still per-
sists. The top ﬁ  ve bases of dis-crimination are — in order of most to least — disability, race, 
national origin, familial status 
and sex.
While unlawful discrimination 
continues to keep many individu-
als and families from obtaining the hous-
ing of their choice, the passage of the Fair 
Housing Act nearly half a century ago took a giant step forward in addressing this is-sue.As an acting chair of the commission, I 
appreciate the opportunity to share infor-mation with my fellow Floridians who have 
the power to ﬁ  ght housing discrimination. 
By contacting the FCHR, a local fair housing center or the U.S. Housing and Urban De-velopment, you will be able to take the ﬁ  rst 
step in that process. Remember, “Shared 
Opportunity in Every Community.”
If you feel you are a victim of housing 
discrimination, I urge you to contact the FCHR at 1-800-342-8170, or visit our web-
site at fchr.state.ﬂ  .us, and allow us the op-
portunity to assist you.

Speaking Out
If you’re like me, you enjoy seeing political “strategy” being played out. 
It’s part of the spectacle 
we all know and love, and 
it’s certainty better than watching 
Donald Trump insult more crucial 
voters.
If you’re like me, you fre-
quently see headlines that read, 
“New polling shows Supreme Court blockade could expand Senate 
map,” or “Sen. Coons says Republicans 
pose ‘Constitutional threat’ by refus-ing Supreme Court nominee hearing,” or “Cracks in the GOP wall: The Republi-cans’ hardline Supreme Court obstruction 
is crumbling.” 
And if you’re like me, you think this is 
absolutely bunk. 
No, Senate Republicans’ tactics will not 
doom the party. No, the GOP’s actions are 
not unconstitutional or unique. No, the GOP is smart.
Let’s get into why:For starters, the Senate is not consti-
tutionally mandated to conﬁ  rm any presi-dential nominee. Moreover, senators are not constitutionally mandated to visit or call a presidential nominee. 
Not meeting Barack Obama’s Supreme 
Court nominee, Judge Garland, is only impolite, not unconstitutional. If you dis-agree, show me where the Constitution says otherwise.
Additionally, the oft-criticized obstruc-
tionist tactics of the Senate GOP have been used and perfected by Senate Democrats way before this conﬁ  rmation ﬁ  ght.
Take the vice president. In 1992, Jo-
seph Biden said, “It would be our prag-matic conclusion that once the political season is underway, and it is, action on a Supreme Court nomination must be put 
off until after the election campaign is 
over. That is what is fair to the nominee and essential to the process. Otherwise, it seems to me we will be in deep trouble as 
an institution.”
Take future Senate Democratic Leader 
Chuck Schumer: “We should reverse the 
presumption of conﬁ  rmation. The Su-preme Court is dangerously out of bal-
ance. We cannot afford to see Justice 
Stevens replaced by another Roberts, or Justice Ginsburg by another Alito. Given the track record of (President Bush) and the experience of ob-fuscation at the hearings — with 
respect to the Supreme Court, at 
least — I will recommend to my colleagues that we should not conﬁ  rm a Supreme Court nomi-
nee except in extraordinary cir-
cumstances.” 
Take President Obama. Back 
in 2006, he ﬁ  libustered Justice Alito’s con-ﬁ  rmation hearing. He now, thankfully and 
coincidentally, “regrets” it.
So, we all agree the Senate is not con-
stitutionally mandated to conﬁ  rm Judge 
Garland, and the tactics of the GOP are 
not unique.
Let’s get into why the current tactics 
are smart.
Saying ﬂ  at out that the Senate will not 
vote on nor talk with Judge Garland is a clever move. Once again, not polite, but 
smart. Saying it puts the GOP in a box is incorrect. It puts them in a fantastic situ-ation.
It’s a safe assumption that the future 
president’s party will carry the Senate.
Let’s pretend that the GOP loses the 
presidential election with candidate Trump. 
Shocker, I know. With the presidency lost, and assuming 
the Senate falls with it, you sprint Garland down the conﬁ  rmation track. He’s better 
than anyone Clinton or Sanders would put 
up. He’s moderate. Bad on guns, yes, but consider the alternatives. As of right now, he does not appear to be Ginsburg 2.0.
Now let’s pretend President Trump 
wins the Oval Ofﬁ  ce and the Senate stays in the GOP’s hands. 
Republicans just have to wait for Presi-
dent Trump to nominate a (hopefully) 
conservative pick. Garland’s hearing or 
conﬁ  rmation proceedings don’t move, and it all works out.   
Heads, the GOP wins. Tails, Democrats 
lose. At worse, a seemingly moderate ju-
rist is on the court. At best, the GOP has 
a brand new conservative on the bench.
No matter what you say or what you 
read, the Senate GOP knows what it’s do-
ing. You can thank the Democratic Party 
for it.

opinions@alligator.orgWhile she may at one point have been a “real Democrat,” 
Debbie Wasserman 
Schultz has increas-
ingly grown out of touch with the people. 
She has been catering more 
to donors than to voters. 
The most recent example of 
this was her use of her position 
as Democratic National Committee chair-woman to set the debate schedule in a way that is deliberately favorable to Hill-ary Clinton.
Wasserman Schultz hasn’t always been 
so quick to cater to the establishment, or 
“The System,” as we call it here at UF. During her time at UF, she ran against the Blue Key party to become president of the 
Student Senate and ultimately won that 
seat. 
She’s spoken about being an indepen-
dent candidate at UF and not being a part of the system. 
However, since leaving UF, she seems 
to have forgotten that. 
While it’s not necessarily a bad thing to 
want to work within a system to change 
it, that is not what Wasserman Schultz is 
doing. 
Instead, she’s working within the sys-
tem, against the poor.
While the fight between the establish-
ment and an “outsider” candidate plays out at the national level with Bernie Sand-ers and Hillary Clinton, a similar race is happening in South Florida for Wasser-
man Schultz’s seat. 
This election cycle, Wasserman Schul-
tz has a challenger, Tim Canova, who is a 
law professor at Nova Southeastern Uni-versity and once advised Sanders. 
Canova similarly fought the Demo-
cratic Party for voter data files, which are not given to those who are challenging 
incumbents. 
He won the right to see voter data, 
though only for himself and not as a pol-
icy change. 
Instead of calling for Wasserman 
Schultz’s resignation, Canova became her first primary challenger, calling out how Wasserman Schultz’s voting record aligns more with what her corporate do-
nors want than what the voters from her 
area want. Like Clinton, on the surface 
Wasserman Schultz appears to truly believe in liberal policy, 
but when you delve deeper into 
her record, that’s not the case.
Wasserman Schultz’s estab-
lishment tactics just won’t cut it 
anymore. 
Even though she’s only re-
ceived $68,000 from payday 
lenders, according to PolitiFact, this 
seems to inform her stance on payday 
lending. 
Also according to PolitiFact, “Wasser-
man Schultz is among Florida lawmakers 
who have defended Florida’s payday law 
despite the fact that some consumer advo-
cates have bashed it and say it traps the poor in a debt cycle.”
Essentially, as the poor take out loans 
they must pay them back with interest 
from their next paychecks, feeding into a 
cycle where they are never able to free themselves of debt. 
Instead of fighting for the poor, Was-
serman Schultz contributes to the cycle of poverty and upholds business as usu-al. While there are regulations in place already, they are often not properly en-forced. 
Not only is this a class issue, but it’s 
also a race issue. According to a Vice arti-cle titled “Inside the Battle over Florida’s Racially Charged Payday Loan Racket,” 
the majority of payday loan locations in 
major Florida cities are in African-Ameri-can and Latino communities. 
The very essence of being a Democrat 
is supposed to be fighting for poor and 
marginalized communities, but that isn’t 
what Wasserman Schultz does.
This presidential season, Wasserman 
Schultz has been unable to be impartial, 
continually working debates in Clinton’s 
favor until she was called out on it. 
While the DNC is supposed to be im-
partial in the primaries, it is far from it. 
It’s still unclear if ousting her as DNC 
chairwoman will solve anything, since she will probably be replaced by just an-other establishment shill, but voting her out of office could be a start to actually 
helping the poor and marginalized.

Freshman Sam Horsﬁ  eld 
claimed the individual title at the Mason Rudolph Championship, leading UF to a second-place ﬁ  nish.Read the story on pg 15. By Luis T orres
Sports Writer
JJ Schwarz had been strug-
gling at the plate during South-
eastern Conference play.
The sophomore was hitting 
a paltry .161 (5-for-31) heading into Sunday’s game.
But with his team needing a 
big hit, he picked a good time to break out of his slump.
Schwarz delivered the go-
ahead RBI single to right ﬁ  eld to give Florida an 8-7 lead. 
UF added two more runs 
in the inning as part of a four-run rally, and the No. 2 Gators completed the sweep over No. 
1 Texas A&M, 10-7, extending 
their program-record home win-ning streak to 27 games.
Schwarz went 2-for-4, driv-
ing in two runs, but he credited a bloop single down the right-ﬁ  eld line in Saturday’s win — his lone hit in the series up to that point — for giving him con-ﬁ  dence heading into the series 
ﬁ  nale.
"I think all my conﬁ  dence 
came from the hit yesterday," 
Schwarz said.
 "Just one little hit like that 
can fuel the ﬁ  re. I was really locked in in pre-game today because I knew I was going to have a big day. It just takes off 
all the pressure on your shoul-
ders."
The sophomore got off to a 
quick start.
In the bottom of the ﬁ  rst, he 
ripped a double down the left-ﬁ  eld line to open the scoring for Florida as part of a two-run ﬁ  rst inning.

FLORIDA SOFTBALL 
WAS ON A SEVEN-GAME 
WINNING STREAK. 
By Matt Brannon
Sports Writer
The inﬁ  eld collapsed as Ala-
bama’s Chandler Dare showed 
bunt.
Pitcher Delanie Gourley charged 
in, scooped the ball cleanly and threw to Nicole DeWitt, who was covering ﬁ  rst base.
But as all three elements con-
verged at the crowded base, the ball ricocheted into right ﬁ  eld.
A runner from ﬁ  rst scored, and 
the Crimson Tide had a ﬁ  rst-inning lead.
No. 7 Alabama’s early lead 
proved insurmountable for Flori-da, as the Crimson Tide defeated UF 3-0 Sunday to became the ﬁ  rst team to beat Florida in a series this year. 
Despite coming in on a seven-
game winning streak, Florida (34-3, 9-3 Southeastern Conference) has now dropped two of its last three.
It was UF’s ﬁ  rst time getting 
shutout at home since losing 7-0 to Alabama in March 2014.
"We got behind early in the ﬁ  rst 
inning," catcher Aubree Munro said. "It’s tough to kind of come back. We had a lot of chances to-day, and we really just didn’t take advantage."
After Dare’s ﬁ  rst-inning bunt 
put her on third base, a passed ball rolled by Munro, and Dare crossed the plate to give Alabama (31-7, 5-4 SEC) the early 2-0 edge.
"We can’t make two mistakes in 
the same inning," assistant coach Jennifer Rocha said. "And that’s what happened."
Alabama pitcher Sydney Little-
john — who came into the game 
with a 1.65 ERA — kept Florida’s 
offense at bay.

hands

After receiving a long-awaited 
gut check against Kentucky last weekend that dropped Florida from its No. 1 status, the Gators came out with a chip on their shoulders and with something to prove.
They answered the call.The Gators responded with a critical three-game sweep of the Aggies that pushed them to a tie for the Southeast-ern Conference lead, showing the country why they can be the most dangerous team in college baseball.
“We just wanted 
to come out and do 
our thing and play like the team we are,” freshman Jonathan India said Friday. “We lost the No. 1 team in the nation position. We’re trying to get it back.”
With the Gators’ performance 
this week, they sent a strong mes-sage about why they should be back on top.
Florida had 36 hits on the week-
end and saw contributions up and down the lineup.

three RBIs in the opener, including a pair of doubles to set the tone for the series. 
First baseman Peter Alonso had a 
team-high eight hits, including a pair of no-doubt home runs in the first two games of the series.
Sophomore JJ Schwarz, who had 
just four hits in his last nine games heading into Sunday’s contest, opened scoring in the finale with a one-out double in the first inning and had the game-winning hit in the sev-enth, a line drive to right field that scored Dalton Guthrie.
“Of course we were salty that we 
didn’t play up to our potential at Ken-tucky,” Alonso said. “I mean, that’s just not us. That doesn’t define our ball club. We wanted to show who we really are.
“I feel like this weekend we did 
that.”
And after dominating Friday and 
Saturday to claim the series, the Gators showed off their resiliency on Sunday.
With starting pitcher A.J. Puk ex-
iting with back spasms after throw-ing just 10 pitches, freshmen Brady Singer and Jackson Kowar were left to handle the brunt of the pitching duties and experienced growing pains in the process.
Twice Texas A&M peppered the 
duo for multiple runs to take the lead, first during a four-run third in-ning against Singer and then during a three-run fifth inning against Kowar.And twice the Gators rallied to re-
gain the lead, sending nine batters to the box in the fourth inning and eight batters in the seventh to come away with the victory.
“It makes me feel good,” O’Sullivan 
said. “It was a different win. … I’m proud of our team. It was a heck of an effort. It took every ounce of focus and energy to get through that game.”
It was an effort that was lacking 
against Kentucky. It was an effort O’Sullivan needed to see.
And it was an effort that let the col-
lege baseball world know the Gators are still a team to be feared.

game, one in the second by Amanda Lorenz 
and one in the third by Justine McLean.
"Sydney Littlejohn threw a great game," 
Munro said. "Honestly she kept us on our toes, and we had to make some adjustments that we just didn’t make in time."
Alabama sealed the upset in the top of the 
sixth when pinch hitter Rachel Bobo reached first after being hit by a Delanie Gourley pitch.
After a sacrifice bunt put Bobo on sec-
ond, coach Tim Walton took out Gourley for sophomore Aleshia Ocasio.
Alabama’s Sydney Booker doubled to left 
with an 0-2 count, driving in Bobo for an in-surance run.
Florida went three-up, three-down in the 
bottom of the sixth.
In the top of the seventh, Alabama’s Kal-
lie Case hit a short ground ball that bounced off her body. While the home plate umpire 
called the ball foul, Walton came out of the 
dugout to tell the umpire it hit Case when she 
was already out of the batter’s box, meaning she should have been out.As the crowd cheered for Walton and the 
argument escalated, the umpire threw Wal-ton out of the game with just over half an inning to go.
"It fired us up," Munro said. "It made us 
want to play for him."
But a re-energized Florida team wasn't 
enough, as Alabama recorded three outs in four batters to close out the game and the series.
"When you get a team like Alabama, you 
can’t make mistakes," Rocha said. "One pitch … could really come back to get you, one er-
rant throw could come back to get you. So 
we just have to keep doing what we’re good at first, pitching and defense."
Florida will have a chance to reset on 
Wednesday when it visits UCF in Orlando at 
6 p.m.
"There’s always things to work on," 
Rocha said. "Sometimes you get exploited. 
You know, middle of the season, there’s no 
secrets. Everybody knows what your weak-
nesses are and they’re attacking (them)."

SOFTBALL,  from pg 13Florida's Walton was ejected in the game's final inning
However, things got tricky 
for the Gators (27-3, 7-2 SEC) 
from there.
Starter A.J. Puk threw one 
pitch in the second before coach Kevin O’Sullivan and the trainer made a trip to the mound.
Puk was seen rubbing his 
back with his glove and had to leave the game because of back spasms. He was replaced by freshman Brady Singer.
Puk threw 10 pitches during 
his one-plus inning of work, but O’Sullivan was impressed with what he saw in his short outing, 
which included two strikeouts 
in the first inning.
"The one word to describe 
the 10 pitches was like, ‘wow’. This is going to be pretty good 
today,’" O’Sullivan said.
From there, the Aggies (22-6, 
4-5 SEC) took control.
Ryne Birk laced a two-run 
double as part of a four-run 
third inning. 
After Florida retook the lead 
at 5-4, Birk struck again in the fifth.
Birk followed up a J.B. Moss 
triple with a two-run shot to right-center, giving the Aggies a 6-5 lead. 
Four batters later, Michael 
Barash restored the two-run lead with an RBI double.
But even though they were 
forced to rally for the second 
time in the game, there was no 
worry in the Gators’ dugout.
"We’re always really confi-dent in our guys," Peter Alonso, who went 8-for-12 in the series, said. 
"We believe in each other, 
we got really good chemistry and we’re an extremely com-petitive group. … We’re always 
striving to win games."
Florida grabbed the lead for 
good in the seventh inning, 
scoring four runs on three hits. The Gators recorded 12 hits for 
the third straight day, giving 
them 36 for the series.
"Hitters were swinging the 
crap out of the ball, not just today, the whole weekend," Schwarz said.
Shaun Anderson pitched the 
final two innings for the Gators, striking out the side in the ninth, and earned his sixth save of the season.
"It could’ve been easy once 
again to kind of have a let down and (win) the first two games, but they battled," O’Sullivan said. 
"It was impressive. It makes 
me feel good that they’re going to continue to fight for 27 in-nings against a really good Tex-as A&M team."

Sam Horsfield sank a short putt 
for birdie on the 18th hole.
By that time, he didn’t even need 
to see the ball go in.
The freshman bent over, plucked 
his Titleist Pro V1x out of the cup 
and it was over.
On Sunday, Horsfield overcame a 
three-shot deficit on the back nine to win the Mason Rudolph Champion-ship in Franklin, Tennessee.
“The year Sam is putting togeth-
er is incredible,” coach J.C. Deacon said in a release. “It was another 
big brick in the foundation that he’s 
building. I’m really happy for him.”
As a team, the No. 7 Gators fin-
ished in second alone at 4 under, a shot shy of winner No. 5 Vanderbilt, which finished the tournament at 5 under. It was Florida’s first time competing in the event.
The Gators began the final round 
at the Vanderbilt Legends Club three shots back of the Commodores but couldn’t climb over the hump.
Although Florida and Vanderbilt 
were neck-and-neck throughout the final 18 — the Gators even held a brief lead during the round — the real battle was between teammates.
Horsfield and fellow UF fresh-
man Gordon Neale battled all day  on the 7,100-yard course. Horsfield 
found himself in familiar territory 
as he had already won two tourna-
ments this year. Neale, on the other hand, was searching for the first win of his career at Florida.Horsfield got off to a fast start 
with a birdie on the first hole to close the gap to a single stroke. Neale fired back quickly, though, with a birdie on the par-4 second. Neale would make two more bird-ies before the end of the first nine to increase his lead to three shots with only nine holes to go.
Nine holes stood between Neale 
and victory.
But not if Horsfield had anything 
to say about it.
Horsfield, the fourth-ranked player in the nation, got off to a fast start on the final nine.
After pars on 10 and 11, the 
Davenport native rallied off three-straight birdies to take the lead.
And he never looked back.Neale closed with two bogeys 
and a birdie on 18 for a final-round 70 to finish in second place at 5 un-der — the best finish of his career.
Horsfield’s tap-in birdie on the par-5 18th propelled him to a 5-un-der 66 on Day 2 — the lowest round of the tournament — and earned him the third victory of his collegiate career, becoming the winningest freshman in UF history. Only five other UF players have won at least 
three events in a season. Arnond 
Vongvanij, a senior at the time, was the last to do so in 2011. 
Perhaps good news for the future, 
the Gators saw improvement out of freshman Jorge Garcia. Garcia, who hadn’t broken par in a tournament since February, carded a 1-under 70 on Day 2 to finish in 13th place. 
The rest of the squad wasn’t as 
lucky.
Sophomore Alejandro Tosti 
had an uneven round, posting five bogeys and a double en route to a 2-over 73 to give him a share of 32nd.
Junior Ryan Orr had six bogeys 
on the back nine to shoot 79, finish-
ing in a tie for 53rd.
Sunday marked the end of the 
regular season for the Gators. Next 
up, Florida heads to St. Simons, Georgia, to compete in the South-eastern Conference Championship on April 15. 
“We played really well (Sunday), 
but we just didn’t finish,” Deacon 
said. “Great teams find a way to fin-
ish and get the job done … I know the guys are really disappointed, but we’ll use it as motivation for SECs and the postseason.
“I think we’re really close to 
playing our best golf of the year.”

THE GATORS HAVE WON FOUR 
TOURNAMENTS IN A ROW. 
By Alfredo Morales

Emily Glaser made history on Sunday.
No. 8 Florida’s first-place finish in the 
Clemson Invitational marked its sixth vic-tory of the season, the most under a Florida coach since the 1986-86 season, when Florida claimed 10-first place finishes on its way to an NCAA title.
Florida finished the final round with a one-
stroke lead over Furman, enough to secure its fourth victory in a row before the SEC Champi-onship on April 15.
“I’m really happy for the team. This win 
was hard fought,” Glaser said in a release. “I was really impressed with our toughness this weekend. It wasn’t our best day, but we fought hard all the way to the end, and it paid off.”
At the end of the first round on Friday, Flor-
ida secured a lead at 4 under par with No. 29 Houston just one stroke behind. The successful start was due in part to junior Karolina Vlckova who — thanks to four birdies — shot 3 under par, leading the Gators and placing herself in a tie for third.
In the second round, freshman Sam Wag-
ner and Vlckova ended in a tie for first. Both recorded six birdies in the round, ending Sat-urday four strokes and three strokes under par, respectively. The rest of the squad, however, did not improve between Friday and Saturday.
Junior Kelly Grassel finished the first round 
at even par due to an even back-nine. Her sec-
ond round, however, saw four bogies and a 
double bogey. Grassel finished Saturday in a 
tie for 33rd place at 6 over.
Sophomore Taylor Tomlinson’s first round 
was marred by a double bogey on the ninth 
hole, causing her to end Friday one shot over par.
The second round was not kind to Tomlin-
son.
Another double bogey on the second hole 
and three bogeys on the back nine led to a round score of 3 over par.
UF went into Sunday’s final round with a 
slight three-stroke lead with Furman University at its heels.
Team leaders Wagner and Vlckova were 
unable to improve or match their previous rounds. Wagner recorded her first over-par round since the Suntrust Gator Invitational, scoring one stroke over par. The Windermere native fell to fourth place due to three bogies on the front nine.
“I struggled in the beginning part of the 
round but was able to make it work,” Wagner said in a release. “We all contributed to this win coming down the stretch, and it feels really great to finish out our regular season strong.”
Meanwhile, Vlckova fell to fifth place with 
two bogeys on both the front and back nines. Vlckova ended the day with a round score of 2 over par, clinching the top-5 finish. However, both Wagner and Vlckova finished the tourna-ment under par for the fourth time this  season.
The rest of the lineup saw improvement on 
the last day, helping Florida secure its victory.
Tomlinson and junior Sydney Needham re-
corded their best round of the tournament Sun-
day, both scoring one stroke under par while 
Grassel matched her first round score of even 
on the final round. All three golfers improved their positions on the overall leaderboards. Tomlinson finished inside the top-25 in a tie for 15th, Grassel just missed out on a top-25 
finish, ending in a tie for 26th, and Needham 
finished in a tie for 60th. 
“I am extremely proud of how the entire 
team handled this week and today especially,” 
Wagner said.
