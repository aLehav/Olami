SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) — A series 
of unfortunate coincidences led to a case 
of mistaken identity that put a Louisi-ana minister behind bars for nearly eight hours. Gregory Jones, pastor at Eden Worship Center, was pulled over for speeding and arrested as a man wanted for violating parole in Texas. 
The minister not only had the same 
name as the wanted man, but the same birthdate — and a Texas driver’s license. So he wound up handcuffed and taken to a Shreveport jail.
Jones said deputies treated him well 
and assured him they were checking his claims. A photograph and fingerprint check eventually confirmed he wasn’t the wanted man.
Caddo Lt. Don Gibbs said the depart-
ment was sorry for Jones’ inconvenience but committed to ensuring wanted crimi-nals don’t accidentally go free.

UF students might have the opportunity to hear from 
Florida gubernatorial candidates Alex Sink and Rick 
Scott much sooner than expected.
Rather than hosting the final debate before the Nov . 2 
election, UF will host the first gubernatorial debate of this 
election season. The debate, organized by Florida Blue 
Key, has been re-scheduled from Oct. 26 to Oct. 4.
“Alex Sink feels very strongly that stu-
dents are the future of our state and she is excited that the first debate will be held at the University of Florida,” said Kyra Jen-
nings, press secretary for the Alex Sink campaign.
Sink sent a letter to Scott on Monday proposing five 
debates in October, the first of which will be held at UF. 
Debates will also take place in West Palm Beach,  
Doral, Davie and Orlando. 
According to Jon Philipson, a member of Florida Blue 
Key and co-chairman of the event, the organization is still waiting for Scott to accept the date change.Gov. debate

Grooveshark, a free music-
streaming website, is now the 
biggest thing to come out of 
Gainesville since Tom Petty and Gatorade.
The website, founded in 
2007 by then-UF undergrads Sam Tarantino and Josh Green-berg,  was named one of the five best music and video web-sites by Time magazine in its “50 Best Websites 2010” list last week. 
Time hails Grooveshark for 
having “one of the most com-plete libraries of any music site,” and for giving users the option to create playlists or lis-ten to streaming radio based on their individual preferences.
“It’s an honor to be recog-
nized by Time, and we appre-ciate them including us in their list,” said Vishal Agarwala, 
Grooveshark’s director of mar -
keting.  “We look forward to 
more grandpas and grandmas using the service.”
Agarwala said he’s been 
w o r k i n g with the company for the past four 
years and calls the job “a dream come true.” He thinks it’s his co-
workers who help set the com-pany apart from competitors.Grooveshark in

A bright rainbow-colored back-
drop decorated the entrance of the 
Rion Ballroom, and a photographer 
snapped photos of incoming stu-dents and faculty as they kicked off the new school year with the LG-BTQ Welcome Assembly Monday 
night.
The event, sponsored by the Pride 
Student Union, featured speeches 
from UF President Bernie Machen 
and PSU President Donnie Fields. 
Fields stressed the importance of 
community and self-identification 
in his speech.
“The most important thing you can do is be visible,” he said. 
This year’s turnout was the big-
gest yet, said Jalise Burt, vice presi-dent of education for the PSU, and required the event organizers to 
pull out extra chairs in order to sat-isfy the crowd. 
“Our purpose is to be more vis-
ible and inclusive. We want to bring 
more people in,” Burt said. “I like 
that we can provide resources in a 
venue that is a safe place, as well.”
Refreshments were served as the 
crowd visited several booths set up alongside the borders of the ball-
room. 
Organizations such as Gator -
Well and University Police both had 
booths and representatives that of-
fered helpful information for stu-
dents.
Freshman civil engineering ma-
jor Juan Camargo said he wasn’t sure what to expect from the event.
“It was definitely a pleasant sur -
prise,” he said. “I really like the at-mosphere — very welcoming.”LGBTQ club kicks off year

A Gainesville political action 
group is suing the the state to make 
education its paramount duty. 
Citizens For Strong Schools is 
one of two political action groups suing the state to provide higher-quality education.
In 1998, a clause was voted into 
the state constitution that made the state legislature’s “paramount duty” to provide high-quality edu-cation. 
In a motion to dismiss the law-
suit, the state  argued that the legis-lature was responsible for deciding how best to adhere to the language 
in the Constitution. But on Thurs-
day, a circuit judge in Tallahassee turned down the state’s motion, al-lowing the case to move to trial. 
“In the long run, we hope that when we elect our officials, they understand that education is the 
lifeblood of any 
c o m m u n i t y, ” 
said Mark McG-riff, the chairman of Citizens For 
Strong Schools.
The suit was 
arranged by the 
Southern Legal 
Counsel, which assembled a group of plaintiffs that also includes the Orlando-based Fund Education Now, as well as concerned parents. 
McGriff said it will probably 
take until 2011 for the case to see the courtroom, and then it could take one to five years to reach its 
conclusion.
He said ultimately, there is 
no specific goal, except to open 
up doors to discuss how to im-prove the education system.  “There is no ABCD list we’re ask-ing for,” he said. “We just want our elected officials to sit and listen to 
us.”
Jon Mills, a UF law professor and 
attorney representing the group, 
said there is precedent for the chal-
lenge, and similar cases have been 
heard in Ohio, Kentucky and Wash-ington. 
The state has until Sept. 9 to re-
spond to the suit.

� SUMMER WEATHER IS KILLING 
FISH IN LAKE SANTA FE.
By MEREDITH RUTLAND 
and GENNARO SCIBELLI
Alligator Contributing Writers
Lake Santa Fe, a popular fishing spot for 
Alachua County anglers, is full of dead shad.  
Thousands of threadfin shad, a bait fish 
only 1 to 2 inches long, were reported dead 
and floating on the surface of the lake Satur -
day , according to  Florida Fish and Wildlife 
Conservation Commission Public Information 
Officer Karen Parker. 
The suspected killer seems to be a combi-
nation of  the summer heat and the cloudy , rainy days of the past week.
A deadly chain of events begins when wa-
ter temperature is higher than normal, some-times reaching 90-degrees Fahrenheit. Water that reaches such high temperatures cannot hold as much oxygen as cooler water, creating 
higher competition among organisms living 
near the surface.
The recent cloudy skies also make it diffi-
cult for plants in lakes to photosynthesize, de-creasing the oxygen content in the water.  
And if the clouds cut off sunlight for a few 
days, primary oxygen producers such as algae will die and begin to decompose, which uses even more oxygen.
These conditions are the “classic setup” 
for a low dissolved oxygen kill, and threadfin shad are among the first species to be affected, according to North Central Region Fisheries 
Administrator Allen Martin.  
Jill McGuire, president of the Santa Fe Lake 
Dwellers Association Inc., an environmental 
watch organization, said Florida Lakewatch, 
part of UF’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, tested the lake’s water and found noth-ing abnormal.
“We’re feeling a lot better,” she said. “We 
were pretty nervous Friday.”
McGuire said there are millions of thread-
fin shad in Santa Fe Lake, and that because they are small and sensitive to heat changes, 
they are the first to die when the temperature 
changes quickly or when oxygen is low.“Hopefully it hasn’t damaged the total 
population,” McGuire said. “I think that’s 
doubtful, as many as they are.”
Parker, from the FWC, said that quick die-
offs of fish populations are normal and aren’t 
a cause for concern. Parker said the biggest 
concern now is the rancid smell from the rot-
ting fish.
“It’s not a pretty sight,” she said.But anglers who enjoy Lake Santa Fe have 
seen kills like this before. Robin Chiappini, 
owner of Chiappini’s Bait & Tackle in Melrose, 
isn’t concerned about any lasting effect on the fishing.  
“The fishing is still really good, and the 
shad should spring right back,” Chiappini said.Something fishy: Rotting shad cause stink in local lake

� THE JOURNALISM SENIOR’S TUITION 
WILL BE PAID IF HE RECEIVES A’S.
By LIDIA DINKOVA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Sometimes it pays to get good grades. 
That is why senior Byron Oldham will be 
spending his last semester at UF with his nose in his advertising textbooks. 
Oldham was the winner of the Best Overall 
Intern award at the Zimmerman Advertising 
Agency in Ft. Lauderdale this summer.
As his reward, the agency will pay for the cost 
of each class in which he earns an “A”  grade 
during the fall semester. If he earns straight A’s, 
the agency will cover his entire tuition and offer him a job after he graduates in December. 
This is known as the “Paying for A’s” pro-
gram, and this summer was the first time the agency offered it. 
“All those [interns] worked their butts off 
and are capable of getting a job anywhere, but one rose above,” said Michael Goldberg, the ex-
ecutive vice president and chief marketing offi-
cer at the Zimmerman Advertising Agency . “We wanted to find that one person who grows in an industry in which few do and to give students a taste of the real world.”
Oldham said the internship was a very com-
petitive one.  
“It’s very true there’s only one winner, es-
pecially in a program like advertising, because when you pitch a campaign you either get the business or you don’t,” Oldham said. 
Goldberg said it was Oldham’s poise and 
ability to lead and inspire that separated him 
from the rest of the pack.
“He was the one who was really the heart 
and soul of the team,” Goldberg said.   
The interns’ final project was 
to think of a new campaign for 
Party City, designed to boost sales through the store’s website. They 
presented their ideas to the president of the Party City franchise  and other company executives. 
“The fact that we were able to give this pre-
sentation to real [executives] was the coolest part for me,” Oldham said.
Goldberg said the interns were unaware they 
were competing for the top spot in the program this summer.
“We did not tell interns the ‘Paying for A’s’ 
program was going on because I wanted to make sure I wasn’t fabricating inspiration,” Goldberg said. “I wanted to have the winner win because 
that’s innately who they are.”Ad agency pays former intern for good grades at UF

SANTA FE COLLEGE

Alligator Contributing Writer 
Any GED-holding student in his 
or her first semester at Santa Fe Col-lege is now eligible for free tutoring, mentoring and seminars through the Pathways to Persistence program.
The three-tiered program focuses 
on mentoring, tutoring and semi-nars. Each student starts with ten hours of tutoring, and additional hours are added as necessary.
Dan Rodkin, director of Student Life at SFC, said free tutoring is pro-vided throughout the student’s first semester. Additional tutoring pro-grams are available for successive semesters.
Tutor Matching Services, a 
Gainesville start-up company that uses a Facebook application to match students with tutors, is ar -
ranging the tutoring and mentoring for SFC. 
Rodkin said there are 23 regis-
tered mentors and more than 100 tu-tors in the system. Dr. Angela Long, student life and 
activities coordinator, said 40 per -
cent of the GED 
population at SFC drops out in the first semester. She said the first couple weeks of the pilot program are critical to the success rates of 
these students since most drop out within the first two weeks.
SFC Student Body President Aus-tin Brinza said he wants to see the program implemented throughout Florida and eventually throughout the country.
“It’s not just about Santa Fe,” he 
said. “If it works here, then it should work throughout the state.”
The pilot project, Pathways to 
Persistence, is based on a proposal presented to U.S. Undersecretary of Education Dr. Martha Kanter and to the U.S. Department of Education policy analysts in late July.
Currently , the program functions as the local model. The second phase is a state model, and the third is a na-tional model.
The group plans to show the 
success rates of Pathways to Persis-tence at the end of the fall semester to receive further funding for the project. The pilot program is funded by SFC.
“This program has the poten-
tial to improve the status quo, and should it receive funding, could serve as a model program,” Rodkin said.

NATIONAL
Historic city in south Pakistan saved from floodwaters
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
THATTA, Pakistan — Thousands 
of people streamed back to this his-
toric southern city where new levees hastily built from clay and stone held back floodwaters that have in-
undated much of Pakistan.
But thousands who fled the wa-
ters that inundated neighboring 
towns complained Monday about the shortage of food and water as they camped in a vast Muslim grave-yard on a hill near Thatta city.
Hordes of people ran after ve-
hicles distributing food and water 
near the graveyard, a chaotic effort 
that left many flood survivors — es-pecially the old and infirm — with nothing. Some drank rainwater pooled on the ground.
“I cannot run after food and sur -
vive the maddening rush at this age of mine,” said 75-year-old Nasima Mai, who fled with her extended 
family, mostly women and children.
“They throw food from the truck 
like animals are given food,” she 
said.
Authorities said they were trying 
to provide food and shelter to the hundreds of thousands of people camped out on the hill in Makli. But as in other areas of the country, the scale of the disaster has over -
whelmed both local capacity and the international partners trying to help.
“We are trying to set up a tent city 
in different parts of Makli so that the distribution (of aid) could be orga-
nized,” said Hadi Baksh, a disaster 
management official in southern Sindh province.
The floods started about a month 
ago in the northwest after extreme-ly heavy monsoon rains and have slowly surged south along the Indus River, devastating towns and farm-land. 
More than 1,600 people have died 
and 17 million more affected by the floods.
Authorities struggled to save 
Thatta on Sunday, building new levees with clay and stone across a major road to hold back floodwaters that inundated the nearby town of Sujawal. Many of Sujawal’s 250,000 
residents had already fled, but the 
water damaged houses, schools and other buildings in the town.
Most of Thatta’s 350,000 resi-
dents had also fled in recent days but began to return to the city as the danger passed, said Baksh.Rodkin
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Hurricane Earl 
battered tiny islands across the northeastern 
Caribbean with heavy rain and roof-ripping winds Monday, rapidly intensifying into a major Category 4 storm on a path projected to 
menace the United States.
Already dangerous with sustained winds 
of 135 mph (215 kph), Earl is expected to gain 
more strength before potentially brushing the U.S. East Coast this week and bringing deadly rip currents.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Mi-
ami warned coastal residents from North Car -
olina to Maine to watch the storm closely.
“Any small shift in the track could dra-
matically alter whether it makes landfall or whether it remains over the open ocean,” said Wallace Hogsett, a meteorologist at the center. “I can’t urge enough to just stay tuned.”
In the Caribbean, Earl caused flooding 
in low-lying areas and damaged homes on islands including Antigua and Barbuda, An-guilla and St. Maarten. Several countries and 
territories reported power outages. Cruise 
ships were diverted and flights canceled across the region.
“We are getting a battering with wind and 
rain,” said Martin Gussie, a police officer in Anguilla. Several utility poles were down and a couple of roofs had blown away , and it was still too dangerous to go out and assess the full extent of damage, he said.
The storm’s center passed just north of the 
British Virgin Islands on Monday afternoon. It was gradually moving away from the Ca-ribbean and was forecast to approach the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region around Thursday, before curving back out to sea, potentially swiping New England or far-eastern Canada.
The Hurricane Center said it was too early 
to say what effect Earl would have in the U.S., but warned it could at least kick up danger -ous rip currents. A surfer died in Florida and a Maryland swimmer has been missing since Saturday in waves spawned by former Hur -
ricane Danielle, which weakened to a tropical storm Monday far out in the north Atlantic.
Craig Fugate, administrator of the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency , said Earl’s approach ought to serve as a reminder for At-lantic coastal states to update their evacuation plans.
“It wouldn’t take much to have the storm 
come ashore somewhere on the coast,” Fugate said. “The message is for everyone to pay at-tention.”
Close on Earl’s heels, Tropical Storm Fiona 
formed Monday afternoon in the open Atlan-tic. The storm, with maximum winds of 40 mph (64 kph), was projected to pass just north of the Leeward Islands by Wednesday and stay far -
ther out in the Atlantic than Earl’s northward path. Fiona wasn’t expected to reach hurricane strength over the next several days.
The rapid development of Earl, which only 
became a hurricane Sunday, took some island-ers and tourists by surprise.At El Conquista-dor Resort in Fajardo, Puerto Rico, people lined up at the reception desk, the lights oc-casionally flickering, to check out and head to the airport. There, more delays awaited.
John and Linda Helton of Boulder, Colo-
rado, opted to ride out the storm. The couple, celebrating their 41st wedding anniversary, finished a cruise Sunday and planned to spend three days in Puerto Rico.
“There was a huge line of people checking 
out as we were coming in, and I thought it was just that summer vacation must be over,” said John Helton, a real estate appraiser. “But we 
paid for the room, so we might as well stick 
it out.”
“I don’t think we could get a flight even if 
we wanted to leave,” Linda Helton added.
There were no reports so far of major dam-
age from Earl.TUESDAY, AUGUST 31, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Tebow’s back on top. 
So to speak. Although his professional 
football career has garnered more attention for a Friar Tuck ‘do than any Heisman-like playing time, The Chosen One has, indeed, been chosen again.
Christian Partner for Life, 
an online guide to Christian 
dating, listed UF’s faithful for -
mer football flame as its most 
eligible Christian bachelor for the year. 
The son of missionaries 
and the reported product of his mother’s refusal to abort him, Tebow is apparently the best answer to the dating guide’s question, “In an ideal world, what characteristics would your future partner have?”
And we couldn’t agree more. Those perfectly sculpt-ed, Florida-grown cheek-bones, famously highlighted by Bible passages, just make us want to read “Leviticus” again and again. 
Noting our former quar -
terback-turned-underwear model is a self-professed vir -
gin who’s saving himself for marriage, the report should knock the bonnets off all sin-gle Christians looking to add a little more Christ love to their 
strictly hand-holding lives. 
Tebow’s faith, no secret to 
any , is also catching the eye 
and greed (lust soon to come) of a Colorado T-shirt compa-ny that is looking to capitalize on Tebow’s godly status by selling at least one style of T-shirt with the slogan, “Saving myself for Tebow,” according to USA Today .

five years later
Time sure does fly when you’re battered by hurricanes, fleeing your home to live in a sports arena, relying on FEMA for pretty much everything and worrying 
about, well, surviving.
Sunday marked the fifth anniversary (seriously, time flies 
when you’re still homeless five years later) of Hurricane Ka-trina’s landfall in Louisiana.
We can barely believe it’s been half a decade since the cost-
liest U.S. hurricane on record at more than $80 billion worth of damage wreaked havoc on the Big Easy and changed the tune of the city forever. 
By comparison, Hurricane Andrew, which eviscerated 
southern Florida, caused only about half that amount of damage when accounting for inflation. 
And that was 18 years ago. Mostly, we’re left wondering how it’s already been five 
years because of the work left to be done in New Orleans. 
As President Barack Obama visited the still-bleeding city 
on the Mississippi River Delta Sunday, he promised to turn vacant lots into businesses and trailers still serving as make-shift classrooms into real schools. 
And after one of the most widely criticized government 
disaster responses in U.S. history, we can’t help but wonder, is this even a problem one person can fix? 
But, hey, there’s always the good news that now The City 
That Care Forgot can stop worrying about that whole boring, Debbie-Downer-of-a-story Katrina mess. 
It has 200 million gallons of oil to clean up.

Ignoring intolerance solves nothing
The Dove World Outreach Center’s hateful plan to 
burn Qurans on Sept. 11 prompts a lot of respons-es from people.
There are folks who decry this extremist group’s 
plan but believe any response gives Dove the attention it seeks. Their solution is to just ignore this open act of aggression against Muslims.
There’s another group who believes Gainesville 
should respond to Dove but ought to do so indirectly by holding separate events on different days promoting peace, tolerance and love.
I fall into a third camp. 
It’s because I believe  Gainesville is a crucial battle-
ground in the fight against hate and bigotry that I will 
march and protest against the Dove World Outreach Center on Sept. 11.
It’s understandable why many people are reluctant 
to directly protest the burning of Qurans. Ideally, Dove wouldn’t receive any media coverage, and it would be ignored on the sidelines as the fringe group it is. 
That didn’t happen.
 The New York Times ran a full story on one of Dove’s 
repugnant events
last Thursday. In July, CNN’s Rick Sanchez inter -
viewed Terry Jones, the pastor-turned-architect of this hateful act. 
Various Turkish media outlets began preliminary 
coverage on the event last week, and I’ve been told Al-
Jazeera — the largest international news network in the Arab world — will be present to cover Dove on Sept. 
11.
The truth is that discrimination against Muslims and 
racism toward Arabs is widespread and pervasive in the United States. Although very 
few Americans agree with Dove’s methods, far too many people are 
complicit in the kind of fear, in-
tolerance and hate that lie at the root of this horrible 
event.
It’s precisely this spirit of exclusion and hostility that 
fuels support for conflict in the Middle East and Asia.
Ignoring racism and bigotry doesn’t have a very 
good track record of success. 
On Sept. 11, the world will fix its attention on 
Gainesville for a reason other than the Gator’s football 
skills. 
The reactionaries and extremists from the Dove 
World Outreach Center want our town to be defined by 
hostility toward Muslims, and whether it’s five or 50 
people burning Qurans, we’re going to be judged inter -
nationally based on our responses to this hateful act.
Will people leave the USF game and go home, be-
lieving that by not standing against Islamophobia they 
were somehow depriving the extremists of the attention 
they seek?
 Or will Gator fans of all races, genders and faiths 
come out in droves to show the world hate and margin-
alization aren’t welcome in Gainesville?
I want to be judged based on the latter.Students for a Democratic Society is organizing 
a peaceful but direct protest against the burning of Qurans, and it will meet Monday at 6: 30 p.m. in An-derson, Room 32. Anyone interested in fighting hate is 
welcome to come and help plan this event.

Speaking OutTUESDAY, AUGUST 31, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 7
A guy walks into a bar. He gets a drink, stands up 
and says, “All politicians are crooks.” A man in the corner replies, “Hey, I resent that.” First guy asks, 
“Why, are you a politician?” Man in the corner says, “No, I’m a crook.”
Be that as it may, Floridians received both politicians 
and crooks a week ago today in its primary election, and 
thanks to media coverage, everyone and their mother 
knows it.
Touted as the “end of incumbency” and the time when 
angry voters would show Washington politicians just how angry they were, Tuesday’s results showcased none of 
that. Well, maybe some of that, but it’s hard to separate 
voter intent from the sheer amount of money spent in this year’s gubernatorial election. This election was the most expensive in Florida history at about $70 million spent, 
and about three-fourths of that coming from Rick Scott’s 
personal bank account. The Senate race, too, has redefined the notion that “money doesn’t grow on trees.”
 Jeff Greene threw in about $30 million of his own mon-
ey to beat sitting Congressman Kendrick Meek. Of course, 
both Scott and Greene’s money trees were planted using 
questionable soil. Scott defrauded the government as the CEO of a mega-hospital and Greene bet against the hous-ing market before it fell.
Stand-up guys, I’m sure.This trend isn’t limited to the Sunshine State, either. Na-
tionwide elections are spending
just as much, and a few individuals are even trumping 
Florida in the race to buy, sorry, win the election. Califor -
nia gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman made her mon-ey as CEO of E-bay and is now working up a hefty bid for governor. To date she has given $100 million (yes, million) to her campaign. Another CEO, Carly Fiorina, has given $5.5 million to her Senate campaign, which seems like pebbles in this envi-ronment. I’m not sure if they’ve been 
paying attention to anything other 
than annihilating their opponent, but their state of Califor -
nia they so desperately want to represent is currently in a 
budget deficit. I’m no mathematics expert, but $100 million 
can buy a lot of government programs. Perhaps it would 
send a better message to voters if the candidates just paid off the state’s debt instead of wasting it on attack ads. If anything, it would at least demonstrate their dedication to reducing the deficit. Then again, attack ads are so much 
fun to watch.
Consequently — and this is a piece of news for all the 
self-funders out there — a recent study by the National 
Institute on Money in State Politics found only one in 10 
of self-funders won between 2000 and 2009.   I don’t even 
want to think about the amount of money wasted there.
Back in Florida, the national media ran stories about 
how “shocking” it was that Scott beat McCollum. The “po-litical outsider” message was a reality! Voters are actually 
rejecting career politicians! The pundits were right! And 
look at Jeff Greene! He lost. 
That’s right, $30 million worth of calling Meek a scum 
of the earth “career politician” got him nowhere. It’s an in-
teresting dichotomy, and pundits are quick to analyze why 
Scott could buy, sorry again, win the election but Greene couldn’t. Is it just Republicans that are full of incumbent hatred? 
Maybe it takes $50 million to fully saturate the TV mar -
ket, and Greene’s paltry $30 million just didn’t cut it. Or maybe Medicare fraud is somehow less ethically offensive to voters than betting against the housing market and rid-ing around Cuba in a yacht.Maybe it’s a combination of all the above. I tend to dis-
agree. At the end of the day, it comes down to Election 101. Meek had a stronghold base of African American voters as 
he faced a guy that behaved like a typical rich guy. Greene 
didn’t interact with the voters nearly as much, and he used his money without a clear message. Meek had better name recognition, was a better established Democrat the voters 
knew (he took his current seat in Congress after his mother 
retired from it), and he started early. Greene’s attack ads came on too late in the game to have any real effect. 
The Republican race for governor was a completely 
different story. It was close all the way to the wire with 
both sides attacking each other for unethical behavior, both 
spending a lot of money (obviously Scott spent more), and both traveling throughout the state (McCollum more than Scott). It was 46 percent to 43 percent at the end of the day 
a week ago today. I call it a toss up. They both had equal 
negative attacks against them, McCollum had the more damaging “career politician” label and voters picked what they thought would be the lesser of two evils.
 Interestingly enough, the third and lesser-known can-
didate, Mike McCallister, was able to get 10 percent of the vote with only $8,000 spent, a result of voters hating both Scott and McCollum. In contrast, the Meek-Greene percent-ages were  more decisive, at 58-31.
So, a note to the media: nothing is what it seems in elec-
tions. Voters decided based on a myriad of reasons, and as much as the pundits like to analyze the why, it comes down to an age-old notion: What happens in the voting booth stays in the voting booth — unless, of course, you 
have a giant money tree in your backyard and you can just 
buy the voting booth — I hear Rick Scott’s is blooming this time of year.

TEEING OFF WITH MIKE McCALL UF SOCCER UF VOLLEYBALL POWELL AND GREEN TO PROVIDE 
DEPTH AT DEFENSIVE END.
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
Kmaistri@alligator.org
 
Many unproven players will take on 
prominent roles for the Gators this season, but perhaps no position will need to replace as much production as defensive end. 
Seniors Justin Trattou and Duke Lem-
mens will be charged with taking over for Jermaine Cunningham and Carlos Dunlap, two second-round NFL Draft selections, when Florida opens up its season Saturday against Miami (Ohio). 
Coach Urban Meyer said junior William 
Green and freshman Ronald Powell will be counted on to provide depth to the rotation, and starting defensive tackle Jaye Howard could see some time at end. 
Trattou has logged seven sacks in his 
career, but Lemmens and Green have com-bined for just three sacks in their time at UF. 
“There’s one known commodity, but 
there’s a little bit of a rotation we’re go-ing to run, especially on Saturday,” Meyer said. 
Opening up the playbook: Just as Satur -
day’s game against Miami (Ohio) will give UF a chance to test its defensive end depth, it will also give the Gators an opportunity to see what they have on offense. 
No one expects Florida to dig deep into 
its playbook out of necessity, but that won’t 
keep Meyer and offensive coordinator 
Steve Addazio from seeing how their new players perform in the offense. Meyer said he plans to use every pack-
age against the Redhawks, including some 
single-wing plays with Trey Burton and 
under-center packages with John Brantley. 
“You’ll see the whole gamut this week,” 
Meyer said. “We’re doing everything we can. Some people say, ‘What do we save?’ 
Save it? We’ve got a bunch of new play-
ers.”
Wide receiver Deonte Thompson and 
running back Jeff Demps are the only re-
turning offensive starters at skilled posi-tions. Meyer added that receiver Andre 
Debose, who previously worked in the slot 
with Chris Rainey, will move to “X” receiv-
er and serve as Thompson’s backup.
Open linebacker spots down to two: 
Meyer announced Monday that senior A.J. 
Jones will start Saturday’s game at strong 
side linebacker, where Jones played along 
Brandon Spikes and Ryan Stamper a season ago. 
Meyer didn’t, however, announce that 
senior Brandon Hicks will start at weak 
side linebacker. Instead, Hicks is expected 
to be in a rotation with sophomore Jon Bos-tic and redshirt freshman Jelani Jenkins at middle and weak side linebacker. 
Bostic and Jenkins were thought to be 
competing for the middle linebacker spot, but the coaching staff has preached versa-tility to its linebacking corps, something Bostic was weary of initially.
“At first I was like why was I rotating, 
but then I saw the good thing that we did was start rotating,” Bostic said.  “Because if somebody goes down in this spot, some-body else can step in there without bring-ing somebody else in who may not be as talented in that position.”

How excited are you for Sat-
urday? I mean, really, how excited?
We haven’t watched legitimate 
football for seven months. Sure, we’ve seen high school all-star games, spring games, pro preseason games, 
speculation about what exactly is 
wrong with a head coach’s health, real drafts, fantasy drafts, debates about the dedication of freshmen and premium cable documentaries about 
Rex ______ Ryan and the New York 
_______ Jets. (Note: if HBO controlled this paper, you’d know ______ well how those blanks would be filled.) 
This week, however, we can finally 
look forward to watching legitimate football in the Swamp.
But not really.Miami (Ohio) 
will soon join Western Ken-
tucky, Hawaii 
and Charleston Southern in the club of sacrificial 
lambs thrown 
into Ben Hill Griffin Stadium as UF shakes off 
preseason rust. In the last three sea-
son openers, the Gators have won by 
an average of 50 points. 
Players won’t say it, and coaches 
definitely won’t say it, but the Red-
hawks have lost before they step on 
Florida Field. 
So how excited are you for Satur -Karl Marx hates Saturdays

Florida’s offensive schemes will re-
main a bit of a mystery until the season 
gets underway this weekend, but count 
left guard Carl Johnson among those who 
want to see a bruising running game.
“That’s every hog’s dream, to play in 
the mud,” the 355-pounder said.
And with the amount of talent on 
the offensive line, letting Johnson & Co. get their hands dirty would be a smart 
move.
The Gators’ expected line of Marcus 
Gilbert, Johnson, Mike Pouncey, James 
Wilson and Maurice Hurt (from left to right) is UF’s most grizzled offensive unit 
with a combined 81 career starts.Gilbert, Johnson and Pouncey started 
all 14 games in 2009, anchoring the na-
tion’s 10th-best rushing attack and sixth-
best total offense, and Johnson has little 
doubt they can repeat the feat this season 
— even without playmakers Tim Tebow, 
Aaron Hernandez and Riley Cooper.
“It’s a team effort and 
a joint effort, and we’re just going to prove ev-
erybody wrong,” John-son said. “People are 
thinking we don’t have 
[Tebow] and we don’t 
have that will, but the offensive line is the 
strength of any team no matter who the 
quarterback is.Linemen excited for 
tweaks in Gators’ offense

UF guard Carl Johnson said adjusting to the speed of defensive ends on the left side 
will be the toughest challenge for tackle Marcus Gilbert.
Johnson helping Gilbert with transition from right to left tackle
“And I feel like we have the best offen-
sive line in the nation, hands down.”
Quarterback John Brantley will pose a 
different challenge for the line as far as pro-
tection.
Without the inside running or scrambling 
skills Tebow leaned on, Brantley will spend more time in the pocket and less dodging 
defenders.
That’s not necessarily a drawback, but it 
is a change of pace, and Brantley is making sure he’s on the same page with his line-men.
“I was texting [Pouncey] last night, 
and we want to get together once a week 
and sit down with the entire offensive line and watch tape with them,” Brantley said. 
“We’re just trying to figure out a time where 
we can sit down once a week and just watch 
film of the opponent and spend some time 
together.”
He may want to get especially close with 
Gilbert, who’ll be manning his blindside in 
the season opener against Miami (Ohio) on 
Saturday.
A right tackle last season, Gilbert flipped 
sides because of injuries to sophomore Xavi-er Nixon (knee) and redshirt sophomore 
Matt Patchan (wrist), both of whom will 
miss at least the first game, UF coach Urban Meyer said.
Gilbert said he hasn’t felt much of a dif-
ference since the switch, but Johnson, a for -
mer left tackle, pointed out that Gilbert’s 
opposition will be tougher than on the right 
side.
“Those ends are ridiculous on the left 
side,” Johnson said. “It’s the [Southeastern Conference], and it’s as close as you can get 
to NFL football. [Gilbert is] a great athlete, 
and the whole left side is going to be vet-eran with me, Mike and Marcus.”
But there’s one big piece missing from 
the middle of the line.
Maurkice Pouncey, a first-team All-
American in 2009, is now with the NFL’s Pittsburgh Steelers, and Mike Pouncey will 
have to fill his shoes while adjusting to his first football season without his twin as a 
teammate.
Mike will replace Maurkice at center, 
and he’s already found a new partner for the pregame ritual he used to share with his 
brother.
Instead of having his twin strap on his 
shoulder pads for him, Mike Pouncey said he’d have Gilbert do it.
“It is different, but we have become ac-
customed to it knowing that someday we would have to part ways in life,” Mike 
Pouncey said. “All of the other offensive linemen are like my brothers, and we are 
here to do one thing: make it to [the SEC 
Championship].”FOOTBALL , from page 14
day?
“Not at all” is the easy answer. 
Fear of oversimplifying aside, 
sports equals entertainment. And 
this game won’t be fun to watch. Don’t be surprised if most of the fans in your section are gone by 
the third quarter.
But a disappointed reaction 
is shortsighted. Florida vs. Mi-
ami (Ohio) is not just about an easy win. The game, along with 
the seven other matchups pit-
ting top-10 teams against over -
whelmed opponents this week, is about sports theory.
On one end of the spectrum sits the NFL, a wildly popular form of American socialism priding it-self in parity. College football sits 
on the other end of the spectrum, 
a capitalist venture that would make Ayn Rand proud.
The NFL rewards the worst 
teams each year by giving them 
the earliest selections from a 
pool of talented new players. In turn, those players are punished by having to work for the worst 
teams. And those eight-figure 
salaries don’t offset the punish-ment. Players would get the same contracts if the best teams had a chance to sign them, too.
The market for the most tal-
ented players enrolling in col-lege, meanwhile, is regulated by football’s version of the invisible hand. Players can choose where 
they want to play, and teams 
must create the best programs to sell those players.
The value of both structures is 
subjective, so it is pointless to de-
bate which is better. And neither 
league will ever change its sys-tem. The NFL is pulling in about 16.6 million viewers for each 
regular season game, and forcing 
teenagers to enroll at certain col-leges should be left to irrespon-sible parents.
But understanding the differ -
ences between the two systems and why each one works helps explain uneven games like Flor -
ida vs. Miami (Ohio). 
Socialism is not inherently bad 
in all business. Because the worst NFL teams get the first draft picks, fans know their teams (outside of Detroit) are potentially one year away from a playoff run. 
Building a championship con-
tender in college football is more challenging. But a capitalist sys-tem forces teams to overcome dis-
advantages in interesting ways. 
Boise State and Texas Tech have been fun to watch because their programs were built on under -
valued players and untraditional 
offenses.
Still, rebuilding a team like Miami (Ohio) seems daunting 
following a 1-11 season, and Red-hawks fans would benefit from 
drafting the best high school tal-
ent. In the meantime, they get stuck facing the Gators.
The average point differential 
in Florida games last season was 
28, twice as high as the point dif-
ferential in games involving the New York Jets and Minnesota Vikings, pro teams that reached 
similar heights to those of Florida 
in 2009.
But don’t worry if you’re re-
ally excited about this Saturday. You probably just really miss 
football.
Or you’re a communist.
TYLER , from page 14“It is different, but [me and Maur -
kice Pouncey] have become accus -
tomed to it knowing that someday 
we would have to part ways in life. 
All of the other offensive linemen 
are like my brothers, and we are 
here to do one thing: make it to [the 
SEC Championship].”
