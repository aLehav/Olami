Voter registration to end_
By TYLER JETT "It's always frustrating for them toAlligator Writer
Today is the last day to register to vote in the
upcoming city election for a city commision seat
and Gainesville mayor.
Registration forms are available online at
http://www.votealachua.com and must be
turned in to the Supervisor of Elections Office, at
111 SE First Ave., which is open from 8:30 a.m.
to 5 p.m.
In addition to registering for the election, resi-
dents can update their voter information if it has
changed.
In past elections, residents have shown up
at the wrong location to cast their votes because
their address had changed, said Pam Carpenter,
Alachua County supervisor of elections.
"It's always frustrating for them to show up
at the wrong polling place because it makes the
process so much longer for them," Carpenter

If a resident does not register to vote in
Gainesville, he or she will not be able to vote
in the city of Gainesville elections on March 16,
when voters will choose between five candidates
running for mayor. Residents of City District 4,
which runs north to south from Northeast 23rd
Avenue. to Williston Road and west to east from
Southwest 34th Street to Waldo Road, can vote
for city commission.
As of Friday, Feb. 12, 72,547 residents have
registered to vote in Gainesville, Carpenter said.

A Gainesville man was arrested Friday after a UF student an-
swered a job ad he posted on Craigslist, met with him and then
found out he was a sex offender.
The ad, posted by 59-year-old Frank McCann, called for
"healthy, slender" women over the age of 18 to model for his
company's "world-renowned exercise program." The student
answered the ad and met with McCann at a local coffee shop the
next day, she said.
After talking to him for an hour Thursday,
McCann told the student she had the "perfect
figure" and that he had a little room in his
house where they could film Friday.
"He kept gazing at me and saying this
would change my life," she said.
Because she felt very uncomfortable at theM.Cann meeting, she said, she Googled McCann. She
found McCann's name listed as a sex offender in the Florida De-
partment of Law Enforcement database.
In 2005, McCann was convicted in Georgia for imprisoning,
molesting and possessing a photo or video of a 12- to 15-year-
old, according to the department's Web site.
The student called the Alachua County Sheriff's department,
and a deputy told her that using the Internet is in violation of his
parole and was enough to arrest him. McCann was charged with
violation of probation and is being held at the Alachua County
Jail with no bail posted.

College Republicans,
PETA 'meat' up Friday
By MATT HARRINGER
Alligator Writer
There were two items on the
menu at the Great Animal Rights
Debate Friday: vegetarian wraps
on recyclable trays and Arby's
roast beef sandwiches.
Bruce Friedrich, vice president
of People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals, debated with the UF
College Republicans about the im-
portance of human rights versus
animal rights in front of a crowd of
about 130 in Fine Arts Building B.
The College Republicans, rep-
resented by the club's president
Johnathan Lott and Florida Fed-
eration of College Republican
Executive Director Bryan Griffin,
said they were in favor of banning
abuse to farm animals as long as
it didn't raise the price of food for
humans.But Friedrich said raising farm
animals actually hurts the environ-
ment and makes food more expen-
sive for humans.
"If you wouldn't hurt animals,
take food from the poor or hurt
the environment, don't pay other
people to do it for you," Friedrich
said.
The UF College Republicans
also debated the tactics PETA uses
to promote its message. They said
PETA uses emotional arguments
and propaganda.
"Animal rights extremism is one
of the greatest threats to our liber-
ties and freedom," Griffin said.

Nine compete for Miss Black & Gold pageant crown
The winner will receive a $1,000 scholarship
By ANDREW WYZAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
It was a regal evening for nine women as
Alpha Phi Alpha held its annual Miss Black
& Gold Scholarship pageant Friday in the
Reitz Union Grand Ballroom.
Contestants chose a historic queen they
most related to for the queen-themed pag-
eant, which drew a crowd of about 275.
The goal of the pageant was to recognize
women in leadership and scholarship roles,said Armando Colbourne, co-director of the
pageant.
Gina Lewis, a marketing senior, took
home the title of Miss Black & Gold at the
end of the night.
"It's extremely overwhelming and excit-
ing," Lewis said after winning. "I've met so
many amazing girls and am glad to have this
experience."
Lewis will receive a $1,000 scholarship for
winning the pageant.
The 1st runner up was Crystal Goss, asophomore recreation event management
major and 2nd runner up was Chelsea Lewis,
junior management and psychology double
major. Goss and Lewis will receive $300 and
$100, respectively.
On Nine collection jars were set
Campus up outside the ballroom, one
for each contestant. The contes-
tant with the most money in their jar won the
"People's Choice" award, and all the money
was donated to Gators United for Haiti.
More than $500 was raised for Haiti, andKyra Montaque, an English junior, took
home the "People's Choice" award.
Contestants also participated in swim
wear, talent and evening wear competitions.
The talent portion of the pageant was a
crowd favorite, and it gave the contestants
an opportunity to showcase their personal-
ity.
Some of the talents included original spo-
ken word pieces, monologues, fashion de-
signs, songs and dances.
"I thought that there were a lot of diverse
talents," said Jasmine Guy, an advertising ju-
nior. "It really kept me engaged."

LGBT couples show
love despite showers
By ERIN JESTER
Alligator Contributing Writer
The rain couldn't ruin their
wedding day.
Seventeen couples braved a
chilly rain storm to pretend to get
hitched Friday in front of Library
West.
The event, Queerly Beloved,
was a mock wedding ceremony for
predominantly same-sex couples.
Queerly Beloved was sponsored
by UF's Office of Multicultural
and Diversity Affairs in honor of
National Freedom to Marry Day,
which took place Feb. 12.
Rather than taking each other
as lawfully wedded spouses, the
couples vowed to accept, affirm
and support any couple's freedom
to marry.
Evan Lauteria, senior secretary
for the Office of Multicultural and
Diversity Affairs, said different in-
carnations of the event have beenhappening at UF since 2004.
Couples were joined in any kind
of partnership they wanted, from
lovers or best friends to "amazing
Latina ally cuties."
Fake wedding certificates were
provided by the Office of Multicul-
tural and Diversity Affairs.
Rev. Meredith Garmon, a min-
ister at the Unitarian Universal-
ist Fellowship of Gainesville, and
Rev. Jim Merritt, of the Trinity
Metropolitan Community Church
of Gainesville, performed the cer-
emonies.
Garmon read the vows of com-
mitment, acceptance and support
as Whitney Blake, a senior sociol-
ogy major and vice president of
outreach for Pride Student Union,
held the hands of her girlfriend,
Alyssa Mullins.
"We hope that one day we can
actually marry," Blake said. "If it's
not to each other, [it should be to]
whoever we want."

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
Political parties reveal platforms for spring election
Unite Party wants tangible results Student Alliance hopes to end perks
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN
Alligator Writer
The Unite Party went back to the draw-
ing board this election season.
Unite Party spokesman Ben Meyers
said students contributed ideas for the
Unite Party's 18-point platform by writ-
ing suggestions on a chalkboard set up
for three days alternating between the Re-
itz Union and Plaza of the Americas last
week.
"This platform was all about the stu-
dents," Meyers said. "For the students, by
the students."
The Unite Party released its platform
Sunday, and is available on the party's
Web site, uniteparty.com
From rebuilding the Reitz Union to
advocating for more environmentally
friendly lighting on campus, the Unite
Party has many goals for improving the
student experience at UF, Meyers said.
"We have realistic goals and realistic
results that we want to bring," he said.Meyers said the two key issues in the
platform are advocating for a new Reitz
Union and protecting Bright Futures in
the state legislature.
"We know what works and what
doesn't," Meyers said. "We know how to
accomplish our goals, and I think that's
reflected in the platforms."
Meyers said the Unite Party wants
to work with UF administrators, not for
them or against them.
"We want to work with the adminis-
tration because we have a lot of the same
interests," he said.
The party platform encompasses real-
istic and financially attainable goals the
Unite Party has for UF similar to past
goals that have extended SNAP hours and
expanded the Student Government com-
puter lab, Meyers said.
"I know that by the end of this term
in Student Government, students will be
seeing tangible results, as they have for
the past year, from the Unite Party," Mey-
ers said.By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN

Ask the Student Alliance party why to
vote for them, and they'll give 70 reasons.
The Student Alliance party released its
party platform with 70 platform points
Sunday, and it is now available on the par-
ty's Web site, ufstudentalliance.com.
Jonathan Ossip, the Senate leader for
the Student Alliance party, said some of
the party's goals include finding alterna-
tive funding for the renovation of the Reitz
Union and implementing an online voting
system for Student Government elections.
Ossip said it is the most comprehensive
platform written by any SG party.
"It takes some of the best ideas that
parties have run on in the past, and we've
added some really innovative new ideas,"
he said.
Ossip said one of the major influences
on the Student Alliance party platformwas the idea that SG needs to work hard-
er for the students and be more aware of
their needs.
"We're really conscious of the fact that
students do not have unlimited resources
to throw at Student Government," Ossip
said.
If elected for SG executive positions,
the party wants to eliminate about $1 mil-
lion wasted annually in the SG budget and
give it back to the students.
Ossip said the party prides itself on the
financial feasibility of its platform points.
It wants Student Government Produc-
tions and Accent to be funded by an en-
dowment rather than the SG budget.
Ossip said students looking at the plat-
form can see the Student Alliance party
has the ideas and the experience to accom-
plish its goals for UF's future.
"It's not just words on the paper," Os-
sip said. "It's stuff that we're really going
to be able to accomplish."

mongering Center for Bioethical Reform and hosted by
UF's own Pro-Life Alliance, is a traveling circus of tower-
ing bloody posters designed to disgust people into turning
against the abortion rights cause.
Now, there are too many things wrong with this project to
include here, but the tenet The Editorial Board takes the most
issue with is the project's comparison of abortion to geno-
cide. Their posters liken legal abortion to tragic periods of
genocide like the Holocaust and the conflict in Darfur. This
cheapens the memory of those affected by actual genocide -
a horrifying concept that differs profoundly from abortion.
If the people behind the Genocide Awareness Project put
as much effort into raising awareness about actual genocide,
the world might be a better place. Instead, they set up their
bloody photographs of abortions gone wrong and rely on
disgust to change people's minds.
Let us be clear: We are not suggesting that there is some-
thing inherently wrong with opposing abortion. However,
the Genocide Awareness Project takes it way too far.
The truth is, those who believe in a woman's right to
choose won't be persuaded to give up that right because of
images that are no more impactful than that of any medical
procedure. It may make us spew Krishna lunch all over the
plaza, but it's not going to make us change our minds.

Danger nothing new in Winter Olympics
here was a considerable amount of finger pointinglast week after Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritash-
vili died during a practice run for the Winter Olym-
pics in Vancouver. I saw the video of the crash in which
Kumaritashvili flew from his luge after exiting a turn over
the 4-foot edge of the track, bounced off a rail and finally
smashed head first into a support column -from a speed
over 80 mph. He died before arriving at the hospital.
This was made all the more agonizing after several crash-
es earlier in the week resulted in medical treatment and criti-
cism that the track was too fast. Hannah Campbell-Pegg, an
Australian luger, likened the feeling of sliding on the track
to being a "crash-test dummy," adding, "I mean, tis is our
lives." Yahoo Sports' Dan Wetzel said her "words should
haunt these games." That's just what these games need: to be
haunted by an athlete's death and another's poor grammar.
Wetzel went further by suggesting the entire luge event be
canceled until they can redesign the track, sounding as if he
had an army of contractors and designers at his beck and call.
Moreover, the tone in several of his columns concerning the
incident is two notches below a state of panic. With his plead-
ing to put everything on hold in favor of a complete overhaul
of the sport, he cited the "recklessly arrogant" speeds of the
sport relative to two decades previous.
Thankfully, the Vancouver Olympic Committee took
action on the speed issue without succumbing to the near
hysterics forwarded by Wetzel. They simply reduced the
speed lugers could attain by moving the starting block down
the mountain. Of course, this simple, logical solution of the
track's safety concerns wasn't satisfactory for Wetzel, who
couldn't comprehend such a quick fix given to such a trag-
edy, as he blatantly stated the simple adjustments to keep the
event on schedule were done solely to parlay the ensuing TV
ratings generated by Kumaritashvili's death.
Wetzel's excessive alarm-raising following the crash is
actually exemplar of a trend -or perhaps a symptom of it-brought to light a day before the in-
cident on The Colbert Report. Colbert
interviewed an art curator who de-aitailed, by way of past games' posters,
the gradual dismantling of Olympic
magnificence over the past century,
Ryan Spencer implying it has been replaced by sti-
Iette rsal Iigator org singly vanilla, corporate-influencedgraphical sterility. Go world, indeed.
It's a good point. What happened
to the guts and the glory? How has the iconic middle-finger-
to-Hitler Owensian triumph, the retro-porn-suggesting, Spit-
zian machismo been replaced by the bong-smoking, $5-foot-
long double-fisting, man-mutant Phelpsian goofiness?
Where's the political gravity surrounding the Miracle on Ice?
Until recently, the greatest drama of the current games was
the criticism of Sports Illustrated for our best skier bending
over on the cover (speed tuck, anyone?). Post-crash, we were
pushed to throw in the towel for an event that had yet to be-
gin seemingly for the sake of throwing in the towel.
Now, I'm not trying to be in opposition of the athletes'
safety, but danger is the name of the game come Winter
Olympics time. There's a higher blade-per-capita rate in
Vancouver now than there is in the San Quentin Prison yard.
Luging equipment consists of a hard plastic boogie board sit-
ting on two weapons-grade sabers, with riders' only protec-
tion coming from high density foam strapped to their heads,
not to mention egregiously thin full-body suits (aka luge-
otards). Looking back on the clip of the crash, a quaint, if now
tactless, quip comes to mind: It's not the fall -or the speed
of the luge -that kills you; it's the sudden stop at the end.
Food for thought: You'd think that in a country synonymous
with hockey, surely somebody would have thought to put
a sufficiently high, resilient, transparent barrier between the
lugers and the columns that can so quickly end their lives.

Guest column
Unite Party attacks are unfounded
n Friday's Alligator, the Unite Party at-
tacked the Student Alliance party for some-
thing they did not do. Let me be perfectly
clear: The Student Alliance party did not par-
ticipate in last week's fliering with anti-Unite
Party messages, and we don't condone such
activities.
I ask the Unite Party this: Do you have any ev-
idence for your claims, or do you simply blame
those who stand against you the first chance you
get? This is a perfect example of the dirty politics
that this campus is sick of. Last week, one of the
"writers" of a Unite Party attack contacted the
Alligator, saying he never wrote a letter attrib-
uted to him. He believes Unite members wrote it
and used his name. The Unite Party's web of lies
continues to grow, and I can only assume that
this past series of letters was written by Unite
Party bosses the same way previous ones were.
Also, Friday's letters would have you believe
that the Student Alliance party is anti-Greek.
This, like the rest of the Unite Party's letters
printed last week, is simply untrue. We even
have Greek candidates for Student Senate, who
I am sure do not appreciate Unite's attacks.
This election is not about Greeks versus non-
Greeks. It's about right and wrong. The future
of our university is on the line, but instead ofJonathan Ossip focusing on the issues
Speaking Out at hand, the Unite Party
feels the need to result to
petty, negative and com-
pletely untrue campaigning.
Their outrage is even more ridiculous based
on the fliers' content. A friend of mine, who
-gasp, shock -lives on Frat Row, texted me
a description. The fliers, which simply said
"Obey?" along with a poorly reproduced Unite
logo, stated that they were made by something
called "Greeks for a Democratic Campus."
Does the Unite Party find it hard to believe
that people besides Student Alliance oppose
them after failure to lead? Unite has written
wasteful budgets, failed to stand up to adminis-
tration and wants to push new fees.
The Student Alliance party is trying to
move SG in a new direction. Our platform
contains about 70 ideas for the future, and
our candidates have a vision of improving
SG and increasing participation on campus.
I challenge the Unite Party to do the same. Stop
running attacks against us in the Alligator, and
let's have a discussion about issues affecting
our university.
Jonathan Ossip is the Student Alliance party's
Senate Leader.

Abortion rights must be protected
ccess to a safe, legal,accessible abortion is a
right that is protected
in the United States today.
Women in this country have
the liberty to make the best per-
sonal decision for themselves
and their families in the event
of an unintended pregnancy.
Ideally, all women would
have access to contraception
and comprehensive sexuality
education to prevent unintend-
ed pregnancy so that no wom-
an has to make that decision.
Until the day comes when
all women are offered compre-
hensive sexuality education
and ready access to contracep-

for abortion, we must protect
the right of abortion. This right
ensures that women can ex-Megan Frazier e r c i s e

of an outside influence.
Today and Tuesday, a na-
tional group called the Geno-
cide Awareness Project will be
on campus.
This is a group that likens
abortion to such human rights
atrocities as the holocaust, slav-
ery and the Rwandan geno-
cide. GAP exploits the victims
of genocide for political pur-
poses. GAP does not address
women's rights to bodily in-
tegrity, to full participation in
society or to something beyond
second-class citizenship. GAPoffers no answers, direction or
approach to reducing the need
for abortion.
The choice to have an abor-
tion is a deeply personal one
that is neither simple nor
mindless, and one that only an
individual woman can know
is right or wrong for her and
her family. Let us not disre-
spect the oppressed people of
our past or the women of our
present by engaging in such
unsound comparisons as GAP
seeks to do. Let us trust and
honor women by respecting
the difficult decisions that they
must make when faced with an
unintended pregnancy and by
providing them with the means
to prevent one.

UF GOLF
Gators cruise to win at home
By KELSIE HOECHERL
Alligator Writer
The Florida men's golf team
dominated at home in this week-
end's SunTrust Gator Invitational,
finishing in first place with a total
score of 841 (283-279-279, +1).
It marked the seventh-consecu-
tive year the Gators have won their
home tournament.
Florida also owned the individ-
ual board, with three golfers tying
for third and the remaining two in
a tie for seventh. But the squad had
to battle for its rankings, as it was a
tournament of comebacks.
"I was particularly pleased with
how many bounce backs there ap-
peared to be," UF coach Buddy Al-
exander said. "I can't say enough
about Tim McKenney, the start he
got off to was just unbelievable.
And then to bounce back with a
low round yesterday and a low
round again today, a big tip of the
cap to Tim.
It's something we have been
working on and I think that is the
biggest thing that happened this
weekend for us in terms of his con-
fidence."
McKenney had the most im-
pressive come-from-behind per-
formance for the Gators. In the
first round of the tournament, the
senior fell to seven-over-par, but
didn't get discouraged.
He finished rounds two and
three carding a one- and four-un-
der, respectively.
McKenney eagled in his second
round and shot a total of 11 bird-
ies. He finished with a three-round
score of 212 (77-69-66, +2).
Also in third were senior Tyson
Alexander (71-70-71, +2) and ju-
nior Andres Echavarria (68-74-70,
+2).
Echavarria started out strong in
the tournament at two under parHarrison Diamond / Alligator Staff
UF senior golfer Tim McKenney was one of three Gators who tied for
third at the SunTrust Gator Invitational this weekend in Gainesville.
but struggled in his second round
with four bogeys. He found re-
demption in the final round mak-
ing an even par with four birdies.
Freshman Phillip Choi (72-70-
72, +4) and junior Bank Vongvanij
(72-70-72, +4) had identical scores
and finished in a tie for seventh
place.
As individuals, the Gators'
golfers did not fair as well as theirteammates.
Freshman Tyler McCumber fin-
ished in a tie for 31st, carding a 221
(75-78-68, +11).
Fellow freshman Tommy Mou
finished five places behind in a tie
for 36th with a 54 hole total of 222
(78-69-75, +12).
Rounding out the individuals,
junior Robbie Wight tied for 42nd
with 223 (75-74-74, +13).MONDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 2010 U ALLIGATOR, 13
Florida's go-to men
struggle from the field
HOOPS, from page 14
And the Gators struggled from the charity stripe for the
second-straight game, hitting just 12 of 23 attempts on the
heels of a 10-of-23 performance against South Carolina.
"They killed us on the glass, and once again free throws
came back to bite us," Parsons said.
Xavier dominated inside, scoring 42 points in the paint
and pushing the Gators around from the start of the game.
Senior forward Jason Love, who was averaging 11 points
entering Saturday's game, scored 14 in the first half and fin-
ished with 20 points and 10 rebounds on 9-of-12 shooting.
XU center Kenny Frease added 12 points in just 16 min-
utes, doubling his season average of 5.8 points per game.
"I thought their frontcourt was as physical as any front-
court that we've played against this year," UF coach Billy
Donovan said. "I don't know how much more we could've
done against their frontcourt."
Despite the Gators being overmatched in the frontcourt,
Macklin managed to score 12 points on 6-of-9 shooting and
grab 10 rebounds.
But UF's top-three scorers -Walker,
Kenny Boynton and Alex Tyus -shot a0 .combined 10 of 32.
Men's "Physically, they wanted it more,"
B Boynton said. "They drove to the basket,Basketball and when they missed, they got their own
rebounds. They pushed the ball. They did a
good job running their game plan. They kept with it."
A victory against the Musketeers would have boosted the
Gators' NCAA Tournament r6sum6, and the loss puts more
pressure on UF to finish out its conference schedule strong.
But Donovan said his team is in no position to even think
about the Tournament given its play Saturday night.
"If you're not winning, you're not going to get there,"
Donovan said. "The fact that we didn't win creates a situa-
tion where we really shouldn't even be talking about that. If
we win enough games, then we can start talking about that."
WALKER HELD OUT OF STARTING LINEUP: Walker did
not start for the first time all season after being late to a team
meeting. Senior forward Dan Werner started in his place, his
first appearance in the starting lineup since Parsons took his
spot earlier this season.
It didn't take long for Walker to see the floor, as he entered
the game just 2:12 into the first half.

UF falls to Xavier, fails to pad resume
* THE GATORS FACE AN
UPHILL CLIMB TO MAKE THE
NCAA TOURNAMENT.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
After a slow start, Florida looked
like it had a chance to snag another
big nonconference win Saturday.
The Gators (17-8, 6-4 Southeast-
ern Conference) fought back from
a 16-point deficit but collapsed in
the final 10 minutes, falling 76-64 to
Xavier (17-7,8-2 Atlantic-10 Confer-
ence) in the O'Connell Center.
UF outscored Xavier 13-6 at the
end of the first half to cut Xavier's
lead to seven and tied it up at 47 on
an alley-oop from Erving Walker
to Chandler Parsons with 13:05 re-
maining in the second half.
UF then took its first lead since
the opening minutes of the game
on junior center Vernon Macklin's
dunk with 12:27 to go.
After pulling ahead 52-50 on a
free throw by guard Ray Shipman,
the Gators made just four field
goals in the final 10:48 and showed
no signs of the intensity they had
when making their comeback.
"When you get down that much,
it's tough to come back," said junior
forward Parsons, who finished with
15 points and eight rebounds. "We
showed some toughness coming
back, but we've really got to do the
things coach talks to us about."
Two areas that UF needs imme-
diate improvement are rebounding
and free-throw shooting.
Xavier outrebounded UF 44-36 Steven H. Keys/AlligatorStaff
and grabbed 19 offensive boards. Xavier's Jason Love scored 20 points -just one shy of his career high -to lead the

Gators suffer blowout loss to Volunteers
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@alligator org
In front of 16,451 fans at Thompson-
Boling Arena in Knoxville, Tenn., the
fifth-ranked Volunteers turned their re-
match with UF into a rout.
The Gators (13-12, 6-6 Southeastern
Conference) lost 83-44 on Sunday; a far
cry from the last-second 66-64 loss to Ten-
nessee (23-2, 11-1 SEC) a month ago.
This time, UF was missing its tallest
player, 6-foot-4 Azania Stewart. UT's An-gie Bjorklund scored 24 points, and the
Gators had 20 turnovers.
It was a six-point
game at the break. Then
the Volunteers broke
the game open after
halftime, outscoring
UF 49-16.
Bjorklund and UT
center Kelley Cain both
Bjorklund scored 14 in the second
half, with Bjorklund burning UF from
beyond the arc and Cain getting easy
put-backs and layups. The Volunteersshot a blistering 64.5 percent (20 of 31)
in the second half, while the Gators shot
21.2-percent (7 of 33).
After sitting in a tie for third in the
SEC following a double-overtime win
against Mississippi State, UF has lost two
straight -by a combined 79 points to
No. 23 LSU and Tennessee -and now is
tied for sixth place.
In fact, the Gators' combined scoring
totals for their past two games (74 points)
would have fallen short of the Volun-
teers' output.

n the last two weeks, I've been
called one of the best student jour-
nalists UF has ever had by a coach
and told I have no idea what I'm doing
by a member of UF's media relations
department.
The truth likely lies somewhere in

the judgment of my work changes
vastly based on the perspective of the
evaluator.
Two people can read the same col-
umn or news story and come away
with two very different opinions.
I do hope, though, that all of my
readers can agree that everything I
write is done without bias.

Quite simply, whether or not some-
thing I write "helps the Gators win"
never even crosses my mind when I sit
down to write a column.

Gators struggle inside without injured Stewart
UF tunes up
before SECs
RYAN BUTLER
Alligator Writer
Members of the UF men's and women's
track and field teams competed in three differ-
ent meets over the weekend but they came home
with similar results.
The Gators recorded seven NCAA Indoor
Championship automatic qualifying marks, 11
provisional marks and combined to win four
events. This weekend's meets were the last regu-
lar-season opportunity for UF to compete before
the Southeastern Conference championships.
"I'm very, very proud of all three groups for
getting some really good thingsDone this weekend," Florida
coach Mike Holloway told the
media Saturday night. "While
Track we're definitely pleased with
the big things we were able to
do this weekend, we're not satis-
fied. The SEC meet is in two weeks and we have
to be at our very best in all areas if we want to
accomplish our goals."
UF's throwers traveled to Ames, Iowa for the
Iowa State Classic while the distance runners
competed at the Husky Classic in Seattle. The
rest of the team was in Fayetteville, Ark. for the
Tyson Invitational.
The Gators recorded four automatic marks at
the Randal Tyson Track Center, which will host
the SEC Indoor Championships on Feb. 26-28.
The distance team put together a strong show-
ing in Seattle, where Charlotte Browning won
the women's mile with a 4:31:24, slicing nearly
five seconds off her previous best and setting a
UF record in the event.
KYLE, from page 14_
when I feel it necessary to com-
ment on a topic that may not
make the most die-hard Gators
fans very happy with me.
It's nothing different than
what columnists at other media
outlets might write, but because
I work for the student newspa-
per there are expectations for meto support the Gators no matter
what.
Last week, I wrote a column
examining how the UF basketball
team reached the point where a
player with Dan Werner's pro-
duction could play 29 minutes a
game.
It wasn't a personal attack, it
was based on statistics and obser-
vation.I felt it was a fair storyline to
examine due to the fact that Wer-
ner is averaging five points, four
rebounds and two assists while
shooting 33 percent from the
field.
Some wanted to know why I
would set out to embarrass Wer-
ner with such harsh words.
I can assure everyone that my
intent is never to embarrass anathlete.
By all accounts, Werner is an
extremely nice and respectful
person who works as hard as
he can and does everything the
coaches ask of him.
At the same time, I can assure
everyone that my intent is never
to protect an athlete from embar-
rassment just for the sake of keep-
ing people happy with me.If Werner, or anyone else, was
upset with me for such biting crit-
icism of his play, I can live with
that because I only wrote what I
believed to be the truth from my
perspective, without bias.
But if everyone was happy
with me only because I chose to
withhold critical opinions in an
attempt to be more well-liked, I
couldn't live with that.

"I'm not going to sit here and say 'Gosh,
Tennessee whooped our tail because we
didn't have (Stewart),"' UF coach Aman-
da Butler said. "I'm sure it would have
helped."
With Stewart out because of a stress frac-
ture in her left foot, the average height of
the Gators' starting lineup was five inches
shorter than the Volunteers.
Six-foot freshman Jennifer George started
in Stewart's place and had nine rebounds,
two blocks and four points in a career-high
32 minutes, but the post play took a hit. UF
was outscored in the paint 42-20.
The lane was clogged up by Cain (seven
blocks) and forward Alyssia Brewer (four)
who combined for 11 of Tennessee's 12
blocks.
"We have the best inside game in our
league," Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said.
"(Cain's) as good as anyone in the country
using the glass."
Cain didn't just pack shots, she finished
with 19 points and eight rebounds.
Despite 11 first-half turnovers, the Gators
traded the lead eight times in that frame
and trailed 34-28. Steffi Sorensen had three
three-pointers early but was shut down in
the last nine minutes.
She led the team with 12 points and
chipped in seven rebounds but was held in
check by the Volunteers' defense after inter-
mission.
Tennessee came out swinging after the
break -nabbing the second half's first sev-
en boards -and used runs of 7-0, 9-0, and
12-0 to build an insurmountable lead.
"Right now we have to respond," Sorens-
en said. "We can't just roll over and die."

UF GYMNASTICS
Gators post high scores but can't overcome Tide
By TOM GREEN
Alligator Writer
Florida traveled to Tuscaloosa,
Ala., wanting to prove how well it
could perform against a great op-
ponent in front of a hostile crowd.
The Gators proved just that Fri-
day night, putting together their
second-highest team total of the
season.
That effort, however, wasn't
enough to overcome No. 2 Ala-
bama (6-1, 4-1 Southeastern Con-
ference), as the Crimson Tide
topped No. 6 Florida (4-2, 3-1 SEC)197.425 -196.6 in front of a Cole-
man Coliseum crowd of 12,466.
"It easily could've been a situa-
tion where they became mentally
intimidated and maybe crumbled
a little bit under that type of pres-
sure with that many people in the
stands, but that didn't happen,"
UF coach Rhonda Faehn said.
"That's a huge plus for the team,
especially the younger gymnasts."
For as well as the Gators per-
formed Friday night -they ex-
ecuted cleanly on all 24 of their
routines -they still had a few
mistakes, and Alabama cameaway with team victories in each
event.
"I think we had more difficult
routines than
Alabama, it's
just we weren't
perfect," senior
Maranda Smith
( said. "We didn't
stick all of our
landings."
Faehn Alabama got
off to a great
start in the first rotation, where
it put together a 49.5 on vault.
That performance gave the Tide a.575-point lead early on.
It wound up being a gap the
Gators could not close throughout
the meet, despite recording sea-
son highs on vault (49.425), where
Ashan6e Dickerson and Dali
Lemezan posted 9.9s, and on beam
(49.175), where Liz Green record-
ed a new collegiate-best 9.875.
Entering the final rotation,
Florida trailed by .525 points.
After its first two routines on
the beam -a 9.825 by Courtney
Gladys and a 9.85 by Elizabeth
Mahlich -it looked as though
the Gators might close in on Ala-bama.
The Crimson Tide finished
strong, though, registering a 9.925
by Geralen Stack-Eaton, a 9.875
by Ashley Priess and a meet-high
9.975 on floor by Morgan Dennis.
Those three Alabama gymnasts
also recorded the top-three all-
around scores of the night, with
Stack-Eaton taking home the all-
around title with a 39.625. Dicker-
son finished fifth with a 39.35.
"Alabama definitely stuck their
landings," Faehn said. "They per-
formed extremely well. They're a
very good team."
No. 3 Florida gets off to 3-1 start after wild weekend
0 THE GATORS WERE UPSET BY NO.
13 GEORGIA TECH.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Writer
In many respects, the Gators softball
team's opening weekend was much more
eventful than they had expected.
Whether it was the upset at the hands
of Georgia Tech, the 12 runs they scored to
overcome the eight they gave up to USF, or
the nail-biting win against Long Island that
came down to the final inning, it's safe to say
the USF Wilson DeMarini Invitational was
more of a rollercoaster than many would
have projected."I anticipated some of this, certainly not
most of it, but some of it," coach Tim Walton
said.
Still, No. 3 Florida was able to escape with
a 3-1 record. The loss came via No. 13 Geor-
gia Tech.
Without question the MVP of the week-
end was senior Francesca Enea, who went 6
for 13 with three home runs and 10 RBI, in-
cluding a grand slam that gave the Gators a
7-2 lead over Long Island in a game that was
tied at two going into the seventh.
"Personally it's really great because I'm
trying to be a leader and to do well in clutch
situations," Enea said.
It seemed those clutch situations were
where the rest of the Gators struggled the
most in the tournament, specifically againstGeorgia Tech where they left a total of eight
runners on base, including seven in the first
three innings.
The lack of big hits was the difference be-
tween the 4-3 win against East Carolina and
the 3-0 loss to the Yellow Jack-
ets, as UF was able to turn five
hits into four runs against ECU
while scoring zero on five hitsSoftball against GT.
"It sucks that we couldn't
get the right hit at the right time
but we got to see what a lot of people are like
in tough situations," Enea said. "Losses are
going to happen and we have to grow from

less of if we come from a win or loss."
It was also an eventful weekend for juniorpitcher Stephanie Brombacher, who went 2-1
including a tough luck loss to Georgia Tech,
a win in relief against Long Island, and a vic-
tory over USF despite yielding eight runs.
In both starts, Brombacher came out hot
only to wither down the stretch.
On each occasion, she held the opposition
scoreless in the first four innings, only giving
up a combined 11 runs after the fourth.
"Both teams swung decently and made
adjustments, but she also fatigued herself
just a little bit and left pitches up," Walton
said.
Freshman Brittany Schutte got her career
off to a good start by hitting a home run in
her second at-bat, and she added another
game-tying longball a day later against Long
Island.
