Liz Hartwell, left, and other citizens cheer after seeing the election results for Amendment 1 at Brophy’s Irish Pub 
downtown Tuesday night. About 58 percent of voters voted against the amendment, preventing its passing.

Both Gainesville city commissioners who were up for re-
election will serve another term, voters decided in Tuesday’s 
citywide election.
At-Large Commissioner Jeanna Mastrodicasa and District 
1 Commissioner Scherwin Henry will both serve their second 
three-year term.
“I wasn’t fully expecting this big of a win, but I’m delighted 
to have it,” Mastrodicasa said.  Mastrodicasa gained a clear ma-
jority of the At-Large votes at 58.13 percent.
Entering the room where candidates, their supporters and 
a bevy of anti-Amendment 1 volunteers waited for the results, Mastrodicasa was greeted with a celebratory uproar.
“Whoa,” she said, looking at at the results on the projector 
screen.“Whoa.”
Sitting nearby was At-Large candidate Robert Krames, who 
came in second place with 25.08 percent of the vote.
Krames, somber-faced in a blue-collared shirt and tie, stared 
at the screen as his wife gripped his index finger.
“I worked really hard to get my name out there,” Krames 
said in an interview a few moments later.
Tom Cunilio, another of the five At-Large candidates, also 
looked unhappy as he watched the election results.
Cunilio received 6.27 percent of the vote.

The number of people who 
voted on campus in city elections 
Tuesday more than quadrupled those who voted in 2006. 
More than 1,500 registered on-
campus voters turned out at the polls on Tuesday as opposed to 363 in 2006, according to a Supervisor of Elections statistics report.
UF business management se-
nior Nicole Joury said her motive for voting was to fight Amend-ment 1, which, if passed, would have removed Gainesville’s civil rights ordinance. 
Joury said if she didn’t feel so 
strongly about the amendment, she would have remained a reg-istered voter in West Palm, where she has voted in the past.
“They’re covering it up with this 
bullshit about protecting people in bathrooms or whatever,” she said. “No one should have the ability to take away people’s rights like that just because they don’t agree with Number of student 
voters increasesUF officials said Tuesday they plan to offer the 
Vietnamese classes taught by laid-off assistant 
professor Andrea Pham next year.
Pham, however, wrote in an e-mail that she 
hasn’t decided yet if she will teach them.
Pham was scheduled to be laid off in June as a 
result of budget cuts, but an arbitrator overturned her layoff more than a week ago, ruling that UF violated its contract with the faculty union when it decided to let her go.
Since Pham is the only faculty member who 
teaches UF’s two Vietnamese courses, they were originally scheduled to be eliminated.
Ann Wehmeyer, interim chair of the Depart-
ment of Languages, Literatures and Cultures, said her department plans to add the courses to the schedule for next year, pending confirmation from Pham.But Pham wrote she has not made up her 
mind.
“Whether I will teach these classes next year is 
(s)till not clear,” she wrote. “I need to solve some 
complications that this layoff 
has created for me.”
UF spokesman Janine Sikes 
said Pham has not been of-
ficially reinstated yet, though she said the process is under way.
Dean of the College of Lib-
eral Arts and Sciences Paul D’Anieri and UF Provost Joe 
Glover did not respond to an e-mail asking about her reinstatement.

Priest sentenced in theft case
WEST PALM BEACH, (AP) — A 
Florida priest who pleaded guilty to steal-
ing more than $370,000 from his church was sentenced Tuesday to 14 months in prison.
The Rev. John Skehan, 81, acknowl-
edged taking the money from St. Vincent Ferrer Catholic Church in Delray Beach during his 40 years as a priest there. 
During his sentencing hearing last 
week, Skehan and supporters pleaded with the judge for leniency. Skehan had faced from 22 months to up to 30 years in prison.
“I humbly ask this court to consider 
the whole of my life in pronouncing this judgment,” Skehan told the judge.
On Tuesday, Palm Beach County Cir-
cuit Judge Jeffrey Colbath sentenced Ske-han to 14 months in prison.
The sentence will be followed by seven 
years probation for the first-degree grand theft charge.2, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, MARCH 25, 2009

� THE COLLEGE MAY SEEK TO
REDUCE ENROLLMENT OVER TIME.
By THOMAS STEWART
Alligator Staff Writer
The undergraduate programs in UF’s Col-
lege of Nursing will not be eliminated under 
a 10 percent budget cut proposal scheduled to be released today by the college, said Tra-cy Wright, college spokeswoman.
However, the college might seek to re-
duce enrollment in the programs over time.
“Like the university as a whole,” she 
said, “we’re focusing more on graduate edu-cation.”
Of the 734 students in the college, 340 are 
undergraduates, with another 333 freshman and sophomores hoping to get in when they become juniors.
Under the proposal, no tenured faculty 
or faculty who would eventually be eligible 
for tenure would be 
cut, Wright said.
The number of 
temporary faculty 
might be cut, how-
ever, which would affect the number of un-dergraduates the college could teach, she said.
In addition to the 10-percent budget cut 
proposal that was requested of all colleges and administrative units, the college was 
asked to present the pros and cons of cutting 
its undergraduate programs. 
The College of Education was asked to 
do the same. It announced Friday that its undergraduate programs would also be spared.UF ACADEMICS
Undergrad nursing programs saved from budget cutsBy KRISTEN HUFF

UF announced the appointment 
of the chief of large animal surgery at UF to interim chairman of the De-partment of Large Animal Clinical Sciences on Tuesday.  
Dr. David Freeman, an equine 
surgeon, was appointed earlier this month to the position, which is in the College of Veterinary Medicine. 
Freeman said his greatest chal-
lenge has been deciding where to suggest the department trim  its 
budget, as UF President Bernie Ma-
chen has requested of all university colleges and administrative units prepare for a 10 percent cut of their budget. 
However, he said he could not 
comment on the specific areas he’s considering because the final deci-sion will come from the dean. 
Freeman was appointed to fill the 
space left by former chairwoman Dr. Eleanor Green, who left to become the dean of Texas A&M University’s College of Veterinary Medicine & 
Biomedical Sciences. 
Freeman said 
he will hold the 
position for at 
least a year so the department can sort out budget issues before its structure is re-
evaluated to de-
termine specific 
needs. Once that is done, a national search will be conducted for a per-manent department chair.
Freeman has continued to be 
chief of large animal surgery, as he was before his appointment. Addi-tionally, now that he is interim dean, he is also chief of staff of UF’s Large Animal Hospital. Freeman said he has been able to handle both posi-tions in part because the hospital has had about one-third fewer animals 
due to the economy. 
“We’ve been affected in the same 
way every business has,” he said. 
Although Freeman is excited to work with faculty members in his temporary position, he said he also 
looks forward to being able to con-duct more research and surgery once the position has been filled. Because of the demands of the position, he’s had to cut back on clinical work, re-search and grant writing, he said. 
“Probably from an early stage my 
goal was to be an equine surgeon,” 
Freeman said. “That’s what brought 
me to where I am today, and it still remains what I’m most interested in doing.”

Jason Froehlich, Chris Law and Drew Green check a Gainesville apartment guide Tuesday on the corner 
of University Avenue and 13th street. The self-proclaimed “rambling men” arrived in Gainesville at 4 p.m. Monday after about a 950-mile drive from Sellersville, Penn. “We keep traveling because we can’t find a reason not to,” Froehlich said.
About 30 students enrolled in the Department of Commu-
nication Sciences and Disorders gathered on the Plaza of the 
Americas on Tuesday to protest the potential cut of their pro-gram from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences.
Students handed out fliers to those passing by for about four 
hours and held posters reading “CSD Deserves to Stay.” 
During a meeting last week, dean of CLAS Paul D’Anieri 
announced a proposal, which would cut $9.3 million from the college’s budget. The geology department, religion department and Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders could all be on the chopping block. 
Kelsey Wallace, a UF graduate student, said the proposal 
outlined two outcomes for the communication sciences and dis-orders department — to be merged into the College fo Health 
and Human Performance or to be cut completely.
“Our program isn’t more important than any other pro-
gram,” Wallace said. “The merger would be good 
for us but not a cut. I know cuts have to happen, but I want them to make sense.” 
Wallace said the CSD program helps veterans, 
stroke patients and those who suffer head injuries overcome speech problems, as well as children with speech impediments or dyslexia. Students also learn how to assist elderly with hear-
ing problems in the audiology department.  She added that the 
department has two nationally ranked programs, the speech pa-thology program is ranked No. 10 in the Association of Ameri-can Universities and the audiology program is ranked No. 3.
Graduate student Kristy Lewandowski agreed and said she 
has a Wednesday meeting set up with D’Anieri  to discuss the possible cut.
“We’re not trying to attack him,” she said. “We’re just con-
fused as to why we’re on the top tier to be completely cut.” 
Wallace said Tuesday’s goal to raise awareness was success-
ful and felt the majority of students showed support.  
“A lot of people understand what we’re going through be-
cause a similar thing is happening to their program,” she said.

One UF student got a taste of 
commercial success after creating 
a new advertisement for a  nation-
wide Hardee’s contest. 
The commercial, which was con-
ceived by UF telecommunications 
senior David Cohen, is one of 16 chosen to promote Hardee’s’ latest creation, the Little Thickburger.
Cohen was watching the Victo-
ria’s Secret fashion show in Decem-ber when he saw a commercial for 
Hardee’s requesting user-submitted 
advertisements.
“I thought to myself, ‘I bet you 
I could make one of those,’” Cohen said.
He logged onto the company’s 
Web site and decided to play around with the site’s ad generator. 
Cohen created several joke com-
mercials and sent them to his friends just for fun before finally submitting one to the company with the words “Just Fasted” over the Thickburger and “Just Hungry” over the Little 
Thickburger.
Though Cohen was worried his 
commercial might have too much of 
a religious connotation, he decided to sleep on it.
The next day, when he was walk-
ing back from class, Cohen had a flash of inspiration.
“I don’t know what it was – maybe it was somebody talking on a 
cell phone nearby or something, but 
my mind finally put together what it had been working on for the past day,” he said.
He rushed home and typed the 
words “No room for dessert” over the Thickburger and “Vanilla or Chocolate?” over the Little Thick-burger and submitted his idea. 
At the time, more than 30,000 commercials had been submitted to 
Hardee’s.
More than two months later, 
Cohen got an e-mail requesting his 
permission to use his concept as a commercial. 
“Apparently one of the Hardee’s 
representatives said I hit the market-ing concept dead-on,” he said. “It’s cool,  beating out all those people 
with something I did overnight.”
As there are no Hardee’s restau-
rants in Gainesville, Cohen said he 
has not yet had an opportunity to try the Little Thickburger. 
Meanwhile, his commercial has 
aired several times. 
Though Cohen has yet to see it, 
he said some of his friends saw it aired during “American Idol.”
He has remained humble about 
his accomplishment, citing it as “one of those things that you would write in a ‘10 things you don’t know about me’ fact list.
Cohen said he writes regularly for 
bleacherreport.com and co-hosted a sports talk show in St. Augustine last summer, but he has no plans to 
switch over to advertising. 
Instead, Cohen said he is inter-
ested in a career in sportscasting. 
He hopes his commercial will be a stand-out piece in his portfolio.
“If it gets me through a door 
somewhere, then great,” Cohen said. “Maybe it will open up a new door for me.”ACADEMICSUF student one of 16 to win nationwide ad contest

Octomom just another attention whore
While the U.S. econ-
omy continues to sing a sour note, 
one sector of industry has left business owners with a 
sweet taste in their mouths.
According to an article in 
The New York Times, candy 
sales across the country have skyrocketed in the wake of the current financial crisis.
From inexpensive choco-
lates to classics such as Mary Janes and Gummy Bears, the 
masses have turned to sug-
ary delights for an afternoon pick-me-up.
Most surprising is the 
revelation that consum-ers are adding candy to their shopping lists, rather than the usual impulse buy of a Reese’s Fastbreak bar 
screaming “eat me” at the 
checkout line.
If Americans can boost 
their spirits with a Snickers bar chased with a handful of Nerds, more power to them.Though the Editorial 
Board tends to parade the fact that we all belong to Al-terEgo Fitness and keep tabs on each other’s diets, we do 
concede candy remains com-
monplace around the Alliga-tor newsroom.
Hell, you should have 
seen the way our eyes lit up just after Valentine’s Day, when an arrival of leftover chocolates resulted in noth-ing short of a feeding fren-
zy.
Rumor has it that a vend-
ing machine chock full of 
sweets used (ahem) to exist at the Alligator back in the day until parents started to complain about having to buy new wardrobes for their budding writer or editor, 
thanks to an ever-expanding 
waistline.
Excuse us while we, uh, 
go hit up the Kangaroo for, umm, “bottled water.” 
Sigh, you caught us.News from Washington reveals word of critical steps 
being taken to increase security along the Mexican border, with hopes of controlling drug cartel-related 
violence.
According to an article in The New York Times, the pres-
ence of federal agents will be increased, along with more sur-veillance equipment to deter illegal traffic moving on both 
sides of the border. This marks the first time in U.S. history 
that attention will be paid to movement into Mexico by the federal government. Specifically, highly modernized X-ray machines will be installed at various entry points along the border, and $30 million from the economic stimulus has been 
allocated to provide support to law enforcement based in the 
region.
The Editorial Board applauds the Obama Administra-
tion for taking a proactive approach to increasing the secu-
rity along the Mexico border. With a great deal of violence 
among the drug cartels in cities such as Tijuana, located right on the U.S. border, inaction on the part of the U.S. govern-ment would have resulted in negative effects for American communities just a stone’s throw away from the mayhem. 
Tuesday’s revelation comes in the wake of Congress already 
setting aside $700 million to aid Mexico in the war on drugs with sophisticated aircraft and education on how to improve the country’s current legal system.
While we generally think of Spring Break when talking 
about safety concerns in Mexico, we must mention that more than 7,000 people have been killed during the last 14 months — a bit more important than drugs, sex and house music.
She’s a spectacle, and just like rubberneckers pass-ing a five-car pileup, Americans can’t seem to look away.
The sensation that is the Octomom, otherwise known 
as Nadya Suleman, has been gracing television sets all over the country. Suleman spoke to Radar Online, an on-line entertainment magazine, through dangerously full 
lips about what it’s like to be her — and undoubtedly 
collected a fat check in the process.
Shame is a foreign concept to Suleman, the woman 
who was catapulted to fame for being irresponsible enough to give birth to octuplets on top of her six previ-
ous children with no way to support them. So far, Sule-
man has reveled in the televised fanfare, milking her 15 minutes of fame for all they’re worth. The Octomom did, however, draw the line at starring in an X-rated film even 
though she was offered a whopping million dollars.
Either she does have a shred of decorum left, or the 
price just wasn’t right.
Suleman knew without a doubt that she wouldn’t be 
able to financially support her brood of children, so what was her plan had she not been offered “a couple of little 
opportunities” from the likes of Dr. Phil and nonprofit organization Angels in Waiting?
Government assistance, of course!
Yes, the answer was quite simple to the single mother 
of 14: Mooch off a system meant to help people who actu-
ally desperately need financial help.
Looking a gift horse in the mouth, Suleman already 
fired the nannies from Angels in Waiting who were tak-
ing care of her children, saying she would find her own 
help. 
It’s anybody’s guess as to how she will afford to find the care for enough little ones to form her very own basketball team.
Never once did this woman 
stop to think that if she couldn’t raise her children, perhaps she should not have had them. Sule-
man claimed that she was living 
in a state of denial and has just 
begun to see the reality of being the single mother of 14 children. Ever the irresponsible drain on society, Sule-man has simply decided to revel in a system that time 
after time has fallen prone to being easily manipulated.
Suleman was supporting her other six young children 
on food stamps, student loans and disability payments. 
Unemployed before giving birth to her octuplets, Octo-
mom apologized to her imaginary legion of fans for what 
she calls a “mess,” but she shows absolutely no signs of remorse or restraint. 
In fact, she’s certainly been hamming it up for all the 
cameras.
While this ordeal is the perfect example of why Amer-
ica desperately needs to have some sort of discourse on welfare reform, it has been portrayed as nothing more than one selfish woman’s obsession with the spotlight.
Regardless of how outrageous Suleman’s actions are, 
her children never asked to come into the world this way. 
For the sake of the children, taxpayers may just have 
to stomach the whole ordeal and sit by as those like Sule-
man work the system for their own benefit.

partment of Geological Sciences, I urge Dean Paul D’Anieri, Provost Joe Glover, the Board of Trustees and President Bernie Machen to re-consider the taking a cleaver to the 
geological sciences department. 
It is obvious that I am biased, 
but even when I try to put my bias 
aside, I cannot fathom how one of the largest universities in the coun-try can maintain its prestige with-
out a Department of Geological 
Sciences. 
The proposed “worst case 
scenario” budget cuts to the Col-lege of Liberal Arts and Sciences would, among other things, cut the departments of geological sciences and religion by about 50 percent. 
It seems (and has been sug-
gested by various faculty members who will remain unnamed) that this would be to slowly phase out the departments. 
What needs to be done is to 
carefully remove certain positions at every department college-wide, rather than focusing the blunt force of the red pen on a few de-partments.
I cannot speak for the Depart-
ment of Religion, but the Depart-ment of Geological Sciences is per-forming cutting-edge research that is important to the state and the nation. 
In the past few years, the De-
partment of Geological Sciences 
has brought in approximately $7 
million from external sources to fund some of this research. 
These research topics range 
from groundwater flow to possible carbon sinks, reconstructing super-
continent breakup and ocean sedi-
ment isotopes, among many other research topics. 
Such components would not 
only add to the prestige of the very well-known department but also 
help better our understanding of 
current world problems, such as global climate change, environ-mental issues and energy solu-tions.
The faculty of the Department 
of Geological Sciences is com-
prised of many very well-known 
scientists who are molding us bud-ding scientists to follow in their footsteps. 
These faculty members are 
comprised of tenured as well as 
nontenured faculty who are all 
important for the department to function. 
Cutting nontenure-track and 
tenure-track faculty members would greatly diminish the amount 
of research our department could 
perform, slash the number of stu-dents (undergraduate and gradu-ate alike) that the department could take in, greatly diminish the qual-ity of education of any remaining students and almost surely lead to 
the phasing out of the department. 
Especially with the current 
growing concern over our environ-
ment, the energy crisis and quickly diminishing potable water supply, not having a thriving geological 
sciences department would be ab-
surd.
The Department of Geological 
Sciences is crucial to the success of The Gator Nation, and the pro-posed budget cuts would handi-
cap our program to the point of no 
recovery.

Last Wednesday College of Lib-
eral Arts and Sciences Dean Paul D’Anieri revealed possible CLAS 
budget cuts which, if implemented, would reduce funding for the Department of Reli-gion at UF by 65 percent. This would leave the department with a mere four faculty 
members and would likely end the gradu-
ate program. 
As graduate students from the UF reli-
gion department, we whole-heartedly con-cur with his vision that a liberal arts educa-
tion strives to change lives and to “ask the 
hard questions.” As students, researchers, teachers and teaching assistants, we can at-test that our classes foster a space for un-
dergraduates from across disciplines to ask 
“hard questions” about religious diversity. These questions will be invaluable to their futures as citizens of a global society. In or-der to continue to offer such a space and to 
contribute to the interdisciplinary relation-
ships, we have forged within the university and beyond. It is crucial for us to retain a strong religion department.
The dean made clear that the proposed 
cuts are partially based upon the small number of religion majors. This criterion overlooks the wealth of resources that our department offers the students who enroll 
in our classes as non-majors. Our students 
are future scholars, but they are also future diplomats, lawyers, public administrators, scientists, health care workers, teachers and engineers. Our introductory classes, such as 
Introduction to Islam, American Religious 
History or Environmental Ethics, allow stu-dents to engage in lively, intelligent debate as they critically analyze the complex and 
ever-changing place of religion in human 
life. They leave our classes better equipped to live, work and thrive within a global-ized world. As the comments we receive on teaching evaluations can attest, our courses 
have changed lives.  
Our students are bridge builders, forg-
ing lasting relationships within UF and on 
the national and international scene. Com-
bined, we have made 13 presentations at 
international conferences and 98 presenta-tions at the national or local level. We have also been published in 72 academic publi-cations. In addition, we have been awarded 
13 outside grants, fellowships and scholar-
ships. Our graduate program, which is split into three unique tracks — Religions of Asia, Religion in the Americas and Religion 
and Nature — has influenced or served as 
an example for other graduate programs, such as the University of Texas at Austin.  
We have worked with religion facul-
ty, along with faculty from the School of 
Building Construction and Design, School 
of Forest Resources and Conservation, the departments of po-litical science, agri-culture, music, world 
languages, history 
and anthropology, the McKnight Brain In-
stitute, the Harn Museum of Art, the Wa-ter Institute, Florida State University and 
Fordham University, to secure several 
large grants and research projects, such as a $300,000 National Science Foundation grant and a Ford Foundation grant. We have also helped faculty form organizations, such as 
the Center for the Study of Hindu Tradi-
tions and the International Society for the Study of Religion, Nature & Culture, which has a global membership of over 300. We 
have given lectures or taught classes at 
venues around Gainesville, such as the public schools. Students have also served other departments, such as Latin Ameri-can Studies, by developing and teaching 
new cross-listed courses. Dismantling the 
religion department would sever these ties that make an invaluable contribution to our university’s vitality.  
The dean has suggested that students 
can be educated about religion by other de-partments. Many of us have worked with scholars in other departments whose re-search deals with religion, and we have the 
utmost respect for their endeavors. None-
theless, we maintain that a strong religion department is crucial to the strength of the entire university.  
Gaining skills over years of having re-
ligion as our central focus, we make a deep-reaching and rigorous analysis of the diverse ways that people negotiate their relationships with one another and with 
the nonhuman world in light of their ulti-
mate concerns. We offer a comprehensive approach that grapples with radically di-verse ways of thinking and being the world — as expressed through sacred texts and 
everyday, embodied cosmologies — and 
explores how these ways of thinking and being derive from and play out in collective action. While we do not relegate religion to 
a realm divorced from human life, neither 
do we reduce it to a simple calculus of eco-nomics, politics or neuroscience. 
When religion enters the public sphere, 
there is often a burst of media interest. Re-
ligion appears with visible force at particu-
lar moments in history and otherwise lurks behind the scenes. The academic study of religion makes visible the continual and 
commonplace presence of religion in mul-
tiple arenas of life.

Amanda Boyd, 23, who gradu-
ated from UF in December, has 
been charged with DUI man-
slaughter for a crash in Septem-ber.
Gainesville resident Betty Hin-
son, 74, was killed in the crash.
A warrant for Boyd’s arrest was served Monday. She was booked into the Alachua County Jail the same day, and bond was set at $25,000.
According to a Florida High-
way Patrol report, Boyd had a blood alcohol level of .21. In Florida a driver is considered im-paired with a blood alcohol level 
of .08.
Boyd told police she left the 
Applebee’s on Northwest 13th Street on Sept. 1 between 5p.m. 
and 5:30 p.m. after having one Michelob Ultra draft around 4 p.m. 
While traveling east on Uni-
versity Avenue in a 1996 black Ford Ranger, Boyd veered onto the shoulder of the road at a curve.
The truck then traveled into 
the opposite lane, striking the left front side of Hinson’s 2008 Chev-rolet Impala at the intersection of University Avenue and State Road 26, according to the report.
The crash occurred at 5:45 
p.m., according to the report.
Boyd’s car continued down 
the road, striking a stop sign and a bike lane sign before turning over onto its right side.
Hinson was pronounced dead 
at the scene, the report stated.
Boyd told police she was trav-eling about 45 mph to 50 mph, but speed calculations indicated she was traveling 60 mph to 68 mph when she applied the brakes.
A toxicology report deter-
mined Boyd had no drugs in her system but had taken prescrip-tion Wellbutrin XL, for depres-sion and anxiety disorders.
Boyd majored in economics at 
UF, according to UF’s Office of the Registrar.
�PRESIDENT OBAMA IS PREPARING 
TO SEND 17,000 REINFORCEMENTS TO AFGHANISTAN.
By RACHEL KOPEC

President Barack Obama’s foreign pol-
icy hits close to home for some women. 
They are the few, the proud, the military 
girlfriends. 
President Obama is preparing to send 
17,000 reinforcements to Afghanistan in addition to about 35,000 troops already 
there.
 Most of them will be deployed to small, 
remote bases in the most violent parts of 
the country, according to the Wall Street 
Journal.Some deployments will happen in April, 
so military girlfriends at UF are preparing 
to say goodbye to their loved ones now.
For Jess Custer, a UF political science 
senior, this means postponing her wed-
ding date an entire year.
“Things I used to read about in text-
books are now affecting whether I can or-
der flowers for my wedding,” she said.
First Lt. Brandt Anderson proposed to 
Custer in November, and the two planned to be married this summer before he left, until his deployment date was moved to April 12.
She said it is difficult to come to terms 
with the idea of him being at war for the next 12 months and to accept the Obama administration’s decision to push up the date for the troop surge. 
When you marry into the military, Custer said, you marry the political ad-
ministration’s ideology also.
“It makes you not want to like whoever 
is in office,” she said.
Thousands of couples have been sepa-
rated in wartime, and she said there is a 
sense of romance to it. She will be sending care packages full of books, food and love letters.
“But the reality is, you are 
going to bed alone at night,” she said.
Amanda Hines, who will 
also say goodbye to her boyfriend in April, 
has lived with deployment anxiety before. 
Her boyfriend, Greg Rigdon, a corporal in the Marine Corps, served eight months in Iraq last year.
Hines, a UF public relations junior, said 
she couldn’t drive him to the airport last time because it was too hard to say good-
bye.
“When he left I felt numb and shaky,” 
Hines said. “I went inside and collapsed.”
While he was gone, she was always by 
her phone waiting for his call. She said 
she was always scared that the call she re-ceived wouldn’t be from him.
Though his phone calls were rare, Hines 
was able to send him daily e-mails or Face-
book messages. 
But in Afghanistan, he will not have 
regular access to the Internet. Rigdon is set 
to leave mid-April and won’t be home un-
til after Thanksgiving. 
Custer said the next year will be a bal-
ance between making her life choices while 
understanding his are on hold.
“It would be nice to have him home,” 
she said. “It would be nice to be normal.”LOCALUF alum arrested in crash that claimed local woman

WASHINGTON — President Barack 
Obama claimed early progress Tuesday 
night in his aggressive campaign to lead the nation out of economic chaos and declared that despite obstacles ahead, “we’re moving in the right direction.”
At the second prime-time news confer-
ence of his presidency, Obama also toned down his criticism of bonuses to executives at bailed-out AIG, and shot back at Republi-can critics of his budget.In office for 64 tumultuous days, Obama 
cast his budget — now under review in Con-
gress — as essential if the economy is to re-
cover. The tax and spending plan “is insepa-
rable from this recovery because it is what 
lays the foundation for a secure and lasting 
prosperity,” he said.
The president also defended the U.S. dol-
lar in the wake of China’s suggestion for a 
universal currency, saying: “The dollar is 
extraordinarily strong right now,” and “I 
don’t believe that there is a need for a global 
currency.”The news conference, lasting 55 minutes, 
came at a pivotal, early moment in Obama’s 
young presidency.
Democrats in Congress 
are readying budget pro-
posals that will largely 
determine how much of 
his first-term agenda will 
be passed, Treasury Sec-
retary Timothy Geithner 
is churning out near-daily 
proposals to solve the nation’s economic cri-
sis and the administration is struggling with public and congressional outrage over bo-
nuses paid to executives of bailed-out AIG.
Additionally, Obama departs next week 
for his first European trip as commander in 
chief, with the global economy a major fo-
cus.
Flexible on some points, Obama was un-
yielding on others.
Pressed on why he seemed to delay be-
fore condemning the AIG bonuses, Obama said, “It took us a couple of days because I 
like to know what I’m talking about before 
I speak.”NATIONAL
Obama claims gains in revival from economic chaos� RALLY TO BE HELD ON APRIL 7 ON THE PLA -

Some UF students are tak-
ing a stand against budget cuts to higher education and subsequent layoffs by joining forces with faculty.
A rally designed to create 
a united front on the issue will be held in the Plaza of the Americas on April 7 and is organized by the student-run Coalition Save Our Schools and the United Faculty of Florida.
Save Our Schools is a coali-
tion of student groups dedicat-ed to raising awareness about budget cuts and encouraging students to take action.
“We’re basically trying to 
start a dialogue between stu-dents and UF administration,” said UF anthropology junior Kathryn Ranhorn, a founding 
member of the coalition.
The rally will feature 
speeches from faculty and 
will give students the chance 
to write letters to state legisla-
tors about the cuts.
The event follows the start-
up of a student group at Flori-
da State University, which has 
a similar goal. 
The organiza-
tion, known as Protect Our Pro-
fessors, hopes to raise $100,000 to donate to FSU’s provost in 
an effort to help professors 
and boost their morale, said Jill Chandler, the senior class 
president at FSU.
Leah Rosenberg, the mem-
bership chair of the United 
Faculty of Florida and an as-sociate professor of English 
at UF, said faculty members 
and students have a different 
understanding of impacts the 
cuts will make, adding they must work together to counter the cuts.Student coalition

The Punch Brothers will strum 
and pluck a unique fusion of blue-
grass and classical music at UF’s 
Phillips Center for the Performing Arts Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.
The band is the new venture of 
composer, singer and mandolinist Chris Thile, showcasing some of the most popular bluegrass, folk and traditional performers. 
“We don’t really have a certain 
sound that we’re going for,” band member Noam Pikelny said. “We love trying to create something new, and we try to create things that really kind of utilize all of our best talents.” 
In addition to Thile and Pikel-
ny, the band is made up of gui-
tarist Chris Eldridge, bass player 
Paul Kowert and fiddle player Gabe Witcher.
First named The Tensions 
Mountain Boys, the group 
changed its name to the Punch 
Brothers, inspired by the Mark Twain short story “Punch Broth-ers, Punch.” 
Pikelny said the story is about 
a jingle that gets stuck in the lis-tener’s head, and the only way to get rid of it is to pass it on to some-one else.
“Boy, it would be nice if our music could get caught in people’s heads,” Pikelny said.
Band members share a history 
of exploring different musical 
styles.
Witcher’s music has been fea-
tured in films like “Brokeback 
Mountain” and “Toy Story.” 
While some may know Thile 
from the band Nickel Creek, he  released his first solo bluegrass album when he was just 13 years 
old. 
“Chris Thile plays the mando-
lin, but he plays it in a way that 
is sort of taking it out of the blue-grass box… and the Punch Broth-ers do that with their music,” said Amy Douglas, the marketing di-
rector for the Phillips Center.
Thile’s newest creation is a 
40-minute composition featured 
on their debut album “Punch.” 
“The concept of ‘Blind Leaving 
the Blind’ was really kind of Chris Thile coming to terms with his life,” Pikelny said. “A life where he got divorced before he was 25, and a life where he was trying to figure out what religion means to him.”
The Punch Brothers will per-
form songs from their new album 
in addition to works in progress 
and some covers. 
 “We want people who love 
good music to come to the show and focus as intensely, or more 
intensely than they would if they 
were sitting silent in a movie theater,” Pikelny said. We want people to take it in and challenge themselves in the way that we’re 
challenging ourselves.”
Ticket prices for the general 
public range from $25 to $45. UF 
students may purchase balcony-level tickets for $10.

Study Seat 
Drew Golbin, a UF sports management graduate student, studies in one of the wooden chairs on the Plaza 
of the Americas Tuesday morning. The chairs are part of a “Vessel Project” assigned to students in Prof. Bradley Walters’ Design 2 class. Students were given a week to design wooden structures that had a com-ponent of tension and could hold something — in this case,  human bodies.
� THEY WERE CHARGED WITH GRAND THEFT.
Two men were arrested Monday and accused of 
stealing chairs, signs and flags. 
At about 2:45 a.m., Gainesville Police officer Crystal 
Castor was patrolling Southwest 39th Boulevard and 
saw two men taking a wooden sign and a flag that be-
longed to the Greenwich Green apartment complex.
When she approached them they ran to a car and 
drove away, the GPD arrest report stated.
According to the report, when Cas-
tor pulled the men over, she handcuffed them and saw several other signs sitting 
in the back of the car.
When she asked them why they were stealing signs, 
Travis Jones, 20, said he and Matthew Clark, 18, did it 
because they were bored.
From the Greenwich Green apartment complex, they 
took a “Car Wash” sign, an “Office” sign, an orange flag and a handicapped-parking sign, the report stated.
Jones told Castor he and Clark had taken lawn chairs 
from patios and a “No Exit” sign from the Woodlands of Gainesville apartment complex, the report stated.
He also told Castor he and Clark took a “Slow: Chil-
dren Playing” sign, a “Make Offer” sign and a “Wel-come” flag from the Fairmont Oaks apartment com-
plex.
Jones and Clark were charged with grand theft.

NEW YORK — Sen. Charles 
Schumer reached out to gay lead-
ers earlier this month and convened a meeting at an upscale Manhattan 
restaurant to make an important 
announcement: He was supporting gay marriage after years of oppos-ing it.
The response from the crowd 
was swift.
“The room applauded,” recalled 
Alan Van Capelle, the executive di-rector of Empire State Pride Agen-
da, who helped organize the dinner 
at Gramercy Tavern.
The reversal marked a signifi-
cant shift for the Democratic senator and gave further momentum to gay marriage in New York, where every other statewide Democratic official supports such unions.
Schumer’s change, some politi-
cal observers suggested, stemmed from pressure to bring his position on gay marriage in line with the oth-er officials, while coming at a time when support for same-sex unions is strong in New York. Also, it’s 
likely New York’s gay rights interest 
groups, which played a role in Dem-ocrats retaking control of the state Senate last November, were press-ing Schumer to change his position.
“At this point we have a fair 
amount of knowledge that support-ing gay marriage in the Northeast is not the kiss of death politically” that 
it could be as recently as a decade 
ago, said Lee Badgett, director of the Center for Public Policy and Admin-istration at the University of Mas-sachusetts Amherst and research director at the Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy at UCLA.
If anything, Schumer’s support 
for gay marriage is likely to bolster momentum for legalizing gay mar-riage in New York, where a gay marriage bill passed the Assembly in 2007.
Massachusetts and Connecticut 
legalized gay marriage, while New Jersey and New Hampshire allow same-sex civil unions. In Vermont, 
where civil unions also are legal, the state Senate on Monday passed a same-sex marriage bill.
Although support of gay mar-
riage is less damaging than it used 
to be, the normally publicity hungry 
Schumer did not really promote his change, quietly issuing a three-sen-tence press release instead. It was Empire State Pride Agenda that made the announcement Monday, 
followed by a brief statement later 
that night.
Schumer declined a request for 
an interview to discuss the change, but spokesman Josh Vlasto released a one-paragraph statement the next day that read: “I have thought long and hard about it. I have always believed that one of the great traits 
in America is we seek equality and 
should always strive to achieve it. We may not have been ready in 1996 
when this issue first arose in Con-
gress but I believe we are now.”
In addition to supporting gay 
marriage, Schumer said he sup-ported a repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, which he had voted for in 1996.
“I’m surprised he didn’t make 
more of a splash about it,” said 
Tom McClusky, vice president of 
the Family Research Council’s leg-islative arm. “Chuck Schumer likes cameras.”
McClusky suggested that for-
mer Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton’s ascension to Secretary of State had something to do with the change of heart. Clinton opposed same-
sex marriage, but her replacement, 
Kirsten Gillibrand, favors it. Mc-Clusky said that Clinton provided Schumer “cover” on the issue that disappeared after Gillibrand’s an-nouncement.
“He wasn’t the only statewide 
elected Democrat who didn’t sup-port same-sex marriage,” he said.
But even with his newfound pub-lic position, Schumer’s reversal isn’t 
likely to have much impact nation-
ally, political scientists say. The De-fense of Marriage Act denies federal recognition of same-sex marriages and gives states the right to refuse to recognize such marriages.
“You’ll need 60 votes in the U.S. 
Senate (to repeal the law),” said Jus-tin Phillips, an assistant professor of 
political science at Columbia Uni-
versity. “It’s hard to imagine at this point where those 60 votes would come from. I couldn’t identify 60 senators who would support that right now.”
The Empire State Pride Agenda 
said Schumer told gay leaders he would work “in the interim” to-
ward changing federal laws and 
regulations to benefit legally mar-ried same-sex couples. Such an ex-ample would be tweaking federal tax codes to allow gay couples to file join returns.
“His support could not have 
come at a better time in our com-munity,” said Empire State Pride 
Agenda’s Alan Van Capelle.

Seventy-eight percent of those who voted at UF’s two 
campus precincts voted against Charter Amendment 1.
UF freshman Christen Downing also voted because of 
her strong opinions on the two amendments but said she 
didn’t vote for a commission candidate.
“I didn’t think I could make an educated vote there,” she 
said, “so I just voted for the amendments.”
Eighty-one percent of on-campus voters voted yes on 
Amendment 2, which requires the passing of a state referendum before 
converting land currently used for 
recreational or conservation purposes 
to other use. 
Out of those who voted, only 75 percent of students vot-
ed for a commission candidate, as opposed to 100 percent 
in 2006.
Garrett Garner, a UF history senior and campus coordi-
nator for Equality is Gainesville’s Business, said he thinks 
the controversy over  Amendment 1 was the biggest cause of student turnout.
“Students just don’t support taking rights away, so they 
turned out en masse today,” he said.
Garner said that Equality is Gainesville’s Business 
pushed its cause on campus because a lot of students didn’t know what the amendment meant for the civil rights of Gainesville residents.
Once they learned about it, Garner said, most wanted to 
take a stand against the discriminatory amendment.
“They stepped up today and overwhelmingly said, ‘We 
do not support discrimination,” he said.

WASHINGTON  — The health 
insurance industry offered Tuesday 
for the first time to curb its contro-versial practice of charging higher 
premiums to people with a history 
of medical problems.
The offer from America’s Health 
Insurance Plans and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association is a potentially significant shift in the 
debate over reforming the nation’s health care system to rein in costs 
and cover an estimated 48 million uninsured people. It was contained 
in a letter to key senators.
In the letter, the two insurance 
industry groups said their members are willing to “phase out the prac-
tice of varying premiums based on health status in the individual mar-
ket” if all Americans are required 
to get coverage. Although the letter left open some loopholes, it was still 
seen as a major development.“The offer here is to transition 
away from risk rating, which is one of the things that makes life hell for 
real people,” said health economist Len Nichols of the New America 
Foundation public policy center. “They have never in their history of-
fered to give up risk rating.”
“This letter demonstrates that 
insurance companies are open to major insurance reform, and are even willing to accept broad con-
sumer protections,” said Sen. Jeff 
Bingaman, D-N.M., a moderate who could help bridge differences on a 
health care overhaul. “It represents 
a major shift from where the indus-try was in the 1990s during the last 
major health care debate.”Insurers are trying to head off the 
creation of a government insurance 
plan that would compete with them, 
something that liberals and many 
Democrats are pressing for. To try to win political support, the indus-
try has already made a number of 
concessions. 
Last year, for example, insurers 
offered to end the practice of deny-ing coverage to sick people. They also said they would support a goal 
of restraining cost increases.NATIONALHealth insurance industry to eliminate risk rating

flects how powerful she is with the university and having that base.”
Richard Selwach, another At-
Large candidate, came in fourth with 
6.19 percent of the vote — which 
was quite unexpected, he said.
“I thought for sure it was going 
to be a runoff,” Selwach said.  “I thought it was going to be a toss-up between Krames, Mastrodicasa and myself.”
While other candidates met with 
supporters or congregated at the Su-
pervisor of Elections Office to watch 
results, Selwach was at Mark’s Prime Steakhouse, where basketball was on TV.
Selwach attributed his loss to 
Gainesville’s “liberal democratic” constituency, he said. However, Selwach said he’s not ready to retire from politics.
“You haven’t seen the last of me,” 
he said, wip-ing sweat off his forehead with a white cloth napkin. 
“I’ll take District 4 or I’ll take the mayor’s seat.”
James Schlacta, the remaining At-
Large candidate, garnered the least votes at 4.34 percent. Schlacta was not at the Supervisor of Elections Of-fice to watch the results come in.
Celebrations were also in or-
der for Commissioner Scherwin Henry, who held a reception at the Matheson Museum.
Henry won the District 1 seat 
with 68.21 percent of the vote. How-ever, Henry said the most important thing is that his constituents are sat-isfied and want him to remain their commissioner for another term.
Henry’s challenger, Marcia Wim-
berly, lost with 31.79 percent.
However, much of the attention 
surrounding the election focused 
on Charter Amendment 1. About 
61 percent of the voters opposed the amendment, which would have eliminated Chapter 8 of the Gainesville Code of Ordinances, titled “Discrimination.”

phy’s Irish Pub, anti-Amendment 1 advocate Daniel Roberts “had his 
fingers crossed” for a “no” vote.
“My faith in Gainesville has been 
restored,“ he said after the final pre-
cinct reported that Charter Amend-ment 1 had failed.
Its passage would have removed protected status for transgender, les-bian, gay and bisexual residents.
Roberts feels that the amend-
ment’s failure sends a message to the rest of the country.
“Perhaps, lesbian, gay, bisexual 
and transgendered people are equal citizens of this nation,” he said.
Citizens for Good Public Policy, 
the pro-amendment group, stated their disappointment in the results in an e-mail sent Tuesday night.
“We remain mindful of the tens 
of thousands of women and children whose privacy and safety have been compromised by the substandard legislative work of the Gainesville 
City Commission,” Mark Minck, 
Citizen’s chairman wrote.
At Brophy’s Pub, about 150 Anti-
Amendment 1 supporters crowded around televisions during an ad-dress from President Barack Obama, who spoke on the economic crisis, but they seemed more focused on the bottom of the screen, where  news tickers showed updated elec-tion results.
Cheers and raised glasses greeted 
each precinct as it became clear that Amendment 1 would fail.
Chris Ott, who volunteered 
with anti-amendment group Equal-ity is Gainesville’s Business, said he canvassed, made phone calls and cut down the wire from about 400  Obama signs to fit the smaller “No on 1” signs.
“I’m just glad that it’s over,” he 
said.
Ott had praise for student vot-
ers of Gainesville. “The student vote was amazing,” he said. “They have open minds, not closed ones.”
Speaking from a barstool amidst 
the crowd gathered at Brophy’s, Joe Saunders, Equality’s campaign manager, gave a victory speech.
“We have set a model here in 
Gainesville,” he said.
Charter Amendment 2, which 
will require a state referendum vote to convert city–owned land used for conservation, recreation or cultural purposes to another use, passed with 80.69 percent of the vote.14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, MARCH 25, 2009

Senators dished out funds to student orga-
nizations at Tuesday night’s meeting but dis-
agreed when it came to determining the future of Student Government’s lobbyists. 
Senators decided not to vote on a bill that 
would hold SG’s two lobbyists more account-able because the majority argued they lack the power to alter the lobbyists’ contracts. 
Together the lobbyists are paid $55,000 a 
year to represent student interests in the state Legislature, a salary drawn from UF students’ Activity and Service Fee. 
The bill, which was first presented at last week’s meeting, was originally intended to 
fire the lobbyists, but it was amended to in-
crease the position’s accountability. 
If passed, lobbyists would have to submit 
a written report four times a year and appear before the Senate twice a year. 
“It’s a real multi-partisan amendment,” 
said Orange and Blue Party Sen. Jonathon Os-sip, an author of the amendment. “It keeps the lobbyists, but it keeps them accountable.”  
Unite Party Sen. Ashton Charles, who mo-
tioned for the bill’s postponement, said she agreed with holding the lobbyists more ac-countable but did not think SG had the power to approve specific contracts.  
“I think it’s disappointing that we keep de-laying action, but if one more week means the bill will pass, then I’m OK with that,” said Or-ange and Blue Party Sen. and bill author Ben Cavataro.  
Two student organizations were also 
unanimously approved for SG funding dur-ing the meeting.  The Billy Mitchell Drill Team received $2,599.55 so that the group can par-ticipate in a national drill meet next month 
in Colorado. The team was originally denied 
funding six weeks ago but, after raising $2,700 on their own, resubmitted their request.
Roots and Shoots, a community service 
group that focuses on environmental issues, was given $191.64. The money allocated to them will be used to purchase tools for service projects done around UF and Gainesville. 
Earlier in the meeting, recently elected Sen-
ate President Audrey Goldman addressed the senators and vocalized goals she would like to accomplish throughout her term. 
Goldman’s agenda includes improving the 
SG Web site and having district senators orga-nize town hall meetings for their constituents. STUDENT GOVERNMENTSenators postpone vote on amended lobbyist bill

■ UF’S FIVE ROAD MEETS HAVE GIVEN THE 
GYMNASTS A CHANCE TO GROW CLOSER.
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
For the UF gymnastics team, travel isn’t all busi-
ness en route to the next meet. There is certainly some leisure to be found.
Whether it’s by plane or bus, the gymnasts have 
racked up some travel stories along with the mile-
age.
From the Southern hospitality in Nashville, 
Tenn., to the maybe not-so-hospitable confines of 
Athens, Ga., a season of traveling provides bond-
ing, some stress and some stress-relieving games.
On the way back from the Southeastern Con-
ference Championships this weekend, the team 
played charades before the plane ride.
“We did the category of animals, and then we 
did a category of movies,” junior Courtney Gladys 
said. “(Melanie Sinclair) doing the animals was hi-
larious. She did a hippo, a chicken, a baboon. There were some other ones. It was definitely worth the entertainment.”
It’s sorely needed entertainment when they’re 
dealing with a three-hour layover for a 30-minute flight.
“The layovers are probably the worst part of 
traveling,” senior Corey Hartung said. Hartung 
admitted she’s the first one to suggest a game when 
boredom kicks in, especially on the bus, even if it 
means being the guinea pig.
“One time I would climb up into the cabin part 
(of the bus) because everyone’s like, ‘Corey you’d 
fit up there,’ and I would crawl up and crawl 
through the cabin,” Hartung said. “I get bored, and 
I can’t sit there.”
Freshman Amy Ferguson was used to traveling 
with her parents and other club gymnasts before coming to UF but said she was nervous going to the first couple of meets. The sudden change of traveling with just her teammates for a dual meet required an adjustment.
“At first I was so nervous on the way there. I 
was always really quiet,” Ferguson said. “But once the first couple away meets came and we got there, you really have so much fun because you bond with the team. It turned into something I definitely 
look forward to.”
With five road meets under her belt, Ferguson 
now has some road trip stories to tell, including 
one from the drive back from Athens on March 1.
“Halfway through, everyone is starting to get 
cramped up, and we stopped at a gas station, and 
five or six of us just went outside and had the most ridiculous rac-es — one leg, hopping on one leg, skipping, jumping jacks,” 
Ferguson said. “At that point 
we were just so tired of sitting 
on the bus, we had to let it out.”
Traveling as an orange-and-blue troupe natural-
ly brings attention, and the airport is no exception.
“Sometimes we get everything but gymnastics,” 
Gladys said. “We’ll get, ‘Oh are you a golfer, vol-leyball player?’ I’ll give them the golfer, but vol-leyball player? I’m like five-foot here.”GATORS HEADED TO IOWA CITY: No. 6 UF was se-lected to the NCAA North Central Regional as the top seed in Iowa City, Iowa, on April 4. 
“We were just hoping we wouldn’t get sent all 
the way across the country,” UF coach Rhonda Faehn said. “We’re happy about Iowa, still fairly close. We’ve never been there, so I think that’ll be something that’s new and exciting.”
Faehn knew heading into the grouping her team 
wouldn’t be sent to closer sites Raleigh, N.C., or Tuscaloosa, Ala., because the Gators are too closely ranked to some of the other schools in those re-gions.Travel time builds team bonds

ON TELEVISION I DID NOT KNOW THATAndrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
UF guard Erving Walker gets stopped by two Penn State players during the 
Gators’ 71-62 loss to Penn State in O’Connell Center on Tuesday night.
Last time I checked, Goliath 
didn’t have home-turf ad-
vantage against David. 
New York Giants receiver Da-
vid Tyree didn’t make one of the 
best plays in Super Bowl history 
with New England snow flurries falling on him. 
Former Valparaiso guard Bryce 
Drew didn’t make a game-win-ning 3-pointer against Mississippi with a stadium full of fans booing him.
The idea of having any sin-
g l e - g a m e champion-ship match on neutral court is ob-vious. 
It’s fair. 
It’s right. It’s common 
sense. 
T h a t ’ s 
why women’s college bas-
ketball has it so, so wrong.  
It wouldn’t have mattered if UF had played Connecticut in Storrs, Conn., Gainesville, Tallahassee or Djibouti. The Gators would have lost. 
Did the NCAA really have to 
gift wrap the Huskies a Final Four berth? A team that goes undefeat-ed doesn’t need any more help. That is, however, just the way the women’s tournament works. And the sad part is, it’s not just with Connecticut. 
How would you feel if you 
were a No. 8 seed — technically the home team — and you had to go play on the No. 9 seed’s home court in the first round. That’s just what happened to eighth-seeded Middle Tennessee State when it traveled to East Lansing, Mich., to play Michigan State. The Spar-tans downed the Blue Raiders by 
1 point, 60-59, with their home 
crowd behind them all the way. Call it a hunch, but you’d think  playing on your home court gives you more than 1 point. 
It gets worse. No. 6-seed Ari-
zona State got to travel to Duluth, Home-court 
advantage not fair

The Gators’ season and senior Walter 
Hodge’s career came to an end Tuesday night.
Penn State (25-11) beat UF (25-11) 71-62 and 
eliminated the Gators from the National Invita-
tion Tournament in the quarterfinal round.
Hodge scored 7 points in his final game at 
the O’Connell Center.
“I’m always going to remember this day. 
And these fans, I really appreciate what they did,” Hodge said. “I think I had a great ca-
reer.”
Senior forward Jamelle Cornley, who did not 
play in Penn State’s second-round win against 
Rhode Island, led the Nittany Lions with 23 
points and 12 rebounds.
Cornley partially separated his left shoul-
der in Penn State’s first-round victory against 
George Mason last week.
Stanley Pringle scored 15, and he and Corn-
ley combined for more than half of the Nittany 
Lions’ offense.
“I thought we were going to do it for Walt,” 
sophomore guard Nick Calathes said. 
“This is Walt’s last home game, and he’s 
been like a best friend to me, and I’ve known him for so long.”
The two teams traded baskets for most of the 
first half.
But with just over four minutes to play, 
freshman guard Erving Walker knocked down 
his third 3-point basket of the first half and brought UF’s lead to 7 points — the Gators’ largest of the game up to that point.
Penn State rallied back, knocking down 
back-to-back threes and took a 33-32 lead into the locker room.
The Gators failed to score a basket in the fi-
nal four minutes of the half.Hodge’s career ends with loss to PSU

The Huskies did not look very sharp 
by their standards against the Gators on 
Tuesday night.
Still, No. 1 Connecticut (35-0) defeat-
ed No. 8-seed UF (24-8) 87-59 in the sec-ond round of the NCAA Tournament in Storrs, Conn., to advance to the Regional 
Semifinals.
The Gators put up all the fight they 
had, trying to stay as close as possible 
throughout, but it was going to take a lot more than effort for them to pull the up-set.
“UConn put it out of reach there in the 
first half,” UF assistant coach Susie Gard-
ner said. 
“We fought back in the second half, 
but they’re an awfully good team.”
UF was hampered by foul trouble ear-
ly on.
Senior point guard Sha Brooks played 
sparingly in the first half after picking up 
three quick fouls in the first seven min-utes, including two offensive fouls in the 
first 1:32 of the game.
All she could do was sit on the bench and watch, a look of disappointment in 
her eyes she hadn’t yet shown this sea-son.
“That was probably, if you want to 
script something, the worst-case scenario that could have happened,” said Gard-ner, who added that she could see tears in Brooks’ eyes after she picked up her third 
foul.
With the Gators’ best player on the 
sideline, senior forward Marshae Dotson 
did all she could to spark her team, scor-ing 12 points before the break. Gators bounced from NCAA Tournament

Fast starts haven’t been one of 
the Gators’ strengths this season.
But on Tuesday in St. George, 
Utah, the No. 26 UF women’s golf 
team made it a strength and got off 
in a hurry with a team score of 36 
over par in the first two rounds of the BYU Dixie Classic. 
“In the first round we had three 
good scores and in the second round we might have gotten a little too comfortable with the course 
and when that happens it can come 
back to bite you,” coach Jill Briles-Hinton said.
Their score was good enough for 
third place, which marks the first time the team has been in the top five after the first day of an event all spring.
Freshman Andrea Watts shot 
5 over par during the first two rounds. Both were played Tuesday. She is currently tied for the seventh-best individual score and is seven shots behind first 
place.
Meanwhile, 
sophomore Jessi-ca Yadloczky had a first-day score of 8 over par. In the first round, she shot 1 over par but could not 
maintain her strong play in the sec-ond round of the day when she shot 7 over par. The wind grew stronger during the second round of play which did not help Yadloczky.
“The wind really picked up in 
the second round, it was like we were in wind tunnels,” Briles-Hin-ton said.
The other three UF golfers, Ni-
cole Schachner, Evan Jensen and Lauren Uzelatz, shot a combined score of 48 over par.
Jensen could not escape her ear-
ly tournament struggles and now has a troubling combined score of 52 over par after two rounds of ev-ery event this spring.With this being the first time 
playing on this course for most of the team, Tuesday was an encour-aging sign.
“They learned a lot about a 
mountain golf course today and they learned a lot about them-selves,” Briles-Hinton said. “Hope-fully they can put everything to-gether tomorrow and we can have 
an excellent finish.”
The Gators will be back on the 
golf course in the final round of the 
Dixie Classic on Wednesday.

Calathes will wait to speak to family, Donovan to make NBA decision
She finished with 22 points.
“We felt like if we could get the ball to 
her, she could use her quickness inside,” 
Gardner said. “Marshae kept us in the 
game.”
Dotson did not get much help else-
where, however, with only three other 
Gators getting on the scoreboard in the 
first half.
The Gators hung tough for the first 12 
minutes of the game.
After UF cut the lead to 6, Connecti-
cut’s Renee Montgomery hit back-to-back threes — including a 4-point play — to ig-nite a 13-0 Huskies run that put them up 39-20 and all but sealed the deal.
The Huskies never looked back.Steffi Sorensen was a small bright spot 
for the Gators.
The junior guard hit a three from near-ly half court at the buzzer of the first half, and UF trailed 47-26 at the break.
Sorensen finished with 9 points on 3-of-
9 shooting from 3-point range.
UF, overmatched at every position on 
the floor, was dismantled on the boards 34-13 before the half.
The Huskies were 
unstoppable on the of-
fensive end as well, with 
three players scoring 20 or more points.
Montgomery led all 
scorers with 25 points. 
Junior center Tina 
Charles added 22 points and 10 rebounds, 
while sophomore guard Maya Moore fin-
ished with 22 points and 14 rebounds.
The game marked the end of the ca-
reers of Brooks, Dotson, Aneika Henry 
and Kim Critton.
A radio broadcast contributed to this report.UConn pulls away with 13-point run
Ga. Their opponent was No. 11-seed 
Georgia, and Athens is about 50 miles from Duluth. Then there was 10th-seeded San Diego State playing DeP-aul — in San Diego. Even No. 6-seed LSU got a home game in the first two rounds. 
Then there was No. 12-seed Gon-
zaga getting to play in nearby Seattle against No. 5-seed Xavier, and Gon-zaga won. Perhaps the worst part was watching as No. 2 Auburn had to play No. 7 Rutgers in its home gym and see-ing the Scarlet Knights wreck them.
I understand the selection com-
mittee wants fans at the game, and the average person won’t pay to go 
see women’s college basketball. You 
don’t, however, sacrifice the sanctity of the game to get fans there. That’s what this is doing.
It’s very debatable if the Gators are 
one of the 16 best teams in the country, but they don’t deserve to be given a 
slap in the face by the selection com-
mittee, which is exactly what they did by giving them a second-round matchup against Connecticut — on the Huskies’ home court. 
If UConn loses at any point in this 
tournament, it’ll be a historic upset. It doesn’t matter where the game is played. There’s no reason to make 
their likely road to a championship as 
smooth as a Porsche riding down I-10 with no traffic.
The Gators aren’t good enough to 
beat a powerhouse this year. It’s just too bad they didn’t have a fair chance to prove it. In the NCAA Tournament, a fair chance should be a given. BRIAN , from page 22 NCAA , from page 22HOOPS , from page 22

Penn State jumped out to an early second-
half lead, but UF managed to cut the deficit 
to a single point after two Calathes foul shots with just more than 12 minutes to play.
The Nittany Lions answered, going on an 
8-0 run that saw Penn State take their big-gest lead of the game.Down 10 with 5:29 to play, UF went on 
a 9-1 run that brought the Gators to within 3 points with a little more than a minute to play.
Penn State stopped any hopes UF had of 
a comeback with back-to-back baskets and six foul shots in the game’s final 60 seconds.
Walker led the Gators with 16 points, and 
center Alex Tyus finished with 15 points and eight rebounds.With the season now over and the NBA  
within his reach, Calathes will have to make a decision about his future.
“I’m not really thinking about that right 
now,” Calathes said. “But when it’s time, I’ll 
sit down with Coach and my family and de-
cide from there.”
Donovan said he was unsure about his 
all-conference point guard’s future.
“I have no idea (about) any of those things. I think last year in New York some-one asked me about Marreese (Speights), and I was being honest. I have no idea,” Donovan said. “I’m supportive of Nick. Nick has always worked hard. He is a really, 
really good competitor. Certainly we would 
love to have him back here, and I would love to coach him again. But if that decision is in 
front of him, it’s probably up to him and his 
family.”24, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, MARCH 25, 2009

With three players listed as 
catchers in the starting lineup, it’s 
no surprise offense gave way to pitching and defense in UF’s Tues-day night matchup with North 
Florida (9-15) in Jacksonville. 
The Gators (14-8) started Hamp-
ton Tignor at catcher, Buddy Mun-
roe at designated hitter and Teddy Foster at first base and played the Ospreys 0-0 into the bottom of the eighth inning when UNF scored 3 unearned runs and defeated UF 3-0 in the first game of the midweek 
home-and-home series. 
Freshman Greg Larson took the 
mound for UF in the eighth inning 
and UNF catcher David Eldredge pinch-hit to lead off the inning. 
Eldredge hit a ground ball to 
second baseman Clayton Pisani, who allowed the hitter to reach base on an error. 
Robbie Collier laid down a sacri-
fice bunt, which moved Eldredge to second base before Larson got the next batter to pop up to Tignor for the second out. A wild pitch moved him to third and UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan brought in junior Tony Davis to try to keep the Ospreys off the board. 
Davis walked a batter then gave 
up the go-ahead run to senior Brian Wilson, who singled through the left side. 
UNF added 2 more runs against 
Davis before the lefty was able to get out of the inning. 
Pisani reached on an error to 
lead off the top of the ninth, but the 
next three hitters went down in or-
der to end the game. 
UF’s best chance to score came 
in the first inning when it loaded the bases with two outs, but Foster flied out to right to end the threat. 
The Gators wasted a solid start 
from freshman Anthony DeScla-
fani, who went 
five innings while allowing just two hits and one walk. 
The teams will meet again to-
night at 6:35 in McKethan stadium. 
LOCKE BACK WITH TEAM:  A UF 
spokesman released a statement 
before Tuesday’s game saying 
that senior pitcher Stephen Locke 
rejoined the team before the home-
and-home series with UNF. 
Locke was kicked off the team 
before the season after being 
charged with a DUI, but the charg-es have been dropped and he has been placed back on the team’s of-ficial roster.  
He did not pitch Tuesday night.Locke posted a 5-2 record and

■ SCC SCORED 5 OF ITS 12 
GAME-1 RUNS ON HOMERS.

The Santa Fe College soft-
ball team, four-time Mid-Florida 
Conference Champions, had two 
swept from under it in a double-header against Seminole Com-munity College on Tuesday.The Saints (33-5, 8-4 MFC) lost 
to the Raiders 12-6 in the first game and 2-1 in the second.
“(It was) disappointing,” SFC 
coach Chris Ahern said.
“They weren’t at their best. 
There were errors at bad times, no hits, and runners were left on 
base — and with bases loaded, 
more than once. They (SCC) came to play. They outhit us.”
SCC, ranked No. 1 in the state, was too much for SFC to handle. A second-inning home run by catcher Kelly Karshner set the tone for the game.
Bitzer and Karshner couldn’t 
keep the ball in the park. Bitzer had a 3-run homer in the top of the fourth and a 1-run homer in 
the top of the sixth. 
Home runs by the Raiders ac-
counted for 5 of the first game’s 
12 runs.Sophomore third baseman 
Kristina Cruz tried to invigorate the Saints offense in the bottom of the third with a home run that 
made the score 5-3, but the mo-
mentum never caught on. 
Cruz went 2 for 3 with two 
RBIs.
In Game 2, the Saints held their 
own, keeping the game scoreless until the third, when the Raiders went up 1-0. Freshman pitcher Kimberly 
Squires (17-3, 0.71 ERA) tied the score in the sixth with a home run, but the Saints fell short in 
the eighth inning, giving up an-
other run.
“We need to hit better,” fresh-
man shortstop Morgan Fortson 
said.
“We need to play as a team 
and realize there are teams out 
there that are better than us.”Saints swept by state’s No. 1 team in doubleheaderBaseball
