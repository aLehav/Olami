Before giving opposing offenses headaches, 
Dominique Easley suffered pains from just sit-
ting inside his Staten Island, N.Y., apartment as a child. 
He had to stay active. Headaches from stay-
ing inside forced Easley to the outdoors. Video games never interested him. He wanted to see the world. Moving was also not a choice. He moved eight times with his family. He re-members the McDonald’s housing projects and moving to his grandma’s house when they got evicted and the place on Sherman Street. 
Naturally curious and inquisitive, Easley 
spent his days exploring his neighborhood streets, learning and observing those around him. He had no choice. He had no car. He did not have much at all. All he had was himself and his family.
“When I was a kid, I used to always take 
the bus and walk everywhere. I would see a whole lot of homeless kids,” Easley said. “Not even adults, but kids. A lot of my friends didn’t grow up off of anything.”
Staten Island made Easley the person he is 
today: a loving father and a caring friend ﬁ  rst, and a football player second.
“I hate to see people hurt. I see people suf-
fer every day,” he said. “When I see somebody hurt, I just get this feeling in my heart. I hate to see it.”
�           �               �Easley’s ﬁ  rst ACL injury came two years 
ago when an offensive lineman fell on his left knee during a 21-7 loss to Florida State. The second tear was a non-contact injury suffered while covering a screen pass during practice on Sept. 24.
Before his latest setback, Easley looked like 
the player who earned a ﬁ  ve-star recruiting ranking coming out of Curtis High in Staten Is-land. He lived in backﬁ  elds, demanded double teams and relished his role as Florida’s emo-tional leader.
Sports Illustrated pegged him as the 15th 
overall pick in a mock draft released the day of that fateful practice.
He announced his intent to enter the NFL 
Draft six days later and signed with agent Thomas Santanello. Renowned surgeon Dr. James Andrews performed the surgery on Ea-sley’s right knee at the Andrews Institute of Orthopaedics & Sports Medicine on Oct. 17 in Gulf Breeze near Pensacola. Now, Easley re-ceives treatment at 10 a.m. and works out at 2 p.m. 
On Wednesday night, he visited the Sand-
ers Practice Fields for the ﬁ  rst time since the practice mishap. He will stay in Gainesville through Florida’s game against No. 2 Florida State on Nov. 30 for Senior Day, when he will likely be honored.
�           �               �
Bombs fell on Baghdad in March 2003. Da-
vid Easley, who was in the Army, would soon leave his family. To his son, who was still in middle school, the deployment meant poten-tially losing his father.
“That was real hard on me, because the war 
just started,” Easley said. “All you kept hearing about, and me being a little kid, is you go to war and some people don’t come back. That’s a hard thing.”
Despite David and Carine Easley, who 
served in the Air Force, separating, he grew up in a close-knit household. His parents, along with his stepmother, uncle, aunt and grand-mother remain strong inﬂ  uences in his life.
A manic work ethic came from his family. A 
free-spirited attitude came from his father who always joked around. Easley brought both to Curtis High.
Peter Gambardella, who serves as the foot-
ball coach and assistant principal cherished the early morning visits in his ofﬁ  ce. As assistant principal and football coach, Gambardella be-came a second father to Easley.
Despite living 45 minutes away, in a rival 
school’s district, Easley rode the bus in the morning and always arrived early enough to stop by Gambardella’s ofﬁ  ce.
Gambardella’s two children became pseudo-
siblings to a bigger-than-normal brother, who ﬁ  nished high school at 6-foot-2, 258 pounds. Gambardella enjoyed the way Easley picked up his children and horsed around with them. 
“You look at him and say, ‘This big guy is 
a monster,’” Gambardella said. “But he has a heart of gold.”
Easley led Curtis High to a Public Schools 
Athletics League Championship in 2009 with a team that Gambardella calls his best ever — not because of talent, but because of heart. A blocked extra point by Easley sealed a come-back 20-19 upset victory in the semiﬁ  nals against top-ranked Brooklyn Fort Hamilton High.
For Easley, the championship run began in 
the weight room.
“He wouldn’t let guys sit down. He pushed 
them every time they weren’t lifting,” Gam-bardella said. 
“The second somebody sat down and talk-
ed, he yelled.”
�           �               �
Easley wasn’t the only defensive lineman 
from the Northeast to choose UF. Sharrif Floyd also overcame obstacles to play college foot-ball.
Both came from the inner city. Floyd hailed 
from Philadelphia George Washington High. Neither had a white-picket-fence suburban up-bringing.
It seemed like a perfect match, but that 
wasn’t the case.
During the recruiting process, a recruiting 
analyst quoted Floyd saying something about Easley that Easley didn’t like. But when the two stayed in the same hotel the weekend of Florida’s spring game in 2010, Floyd visited Easley’s room.
The two hashed out their differences and 
bonded during a conversation about their up-bringings. They not only shared the same hotel, but they also shared the same outlook on life. 
“It’s that East Coast thing, being from Philly 
and New York,” Floyd said. “(We) came to-gether at Florida and clicked with each other, because we knew where we were from and we knew what we expected from each other.”
Floyd and Easley anchored a defensive line 
that allowed only ﬁ  ve 100-yard rushers in 21 starts together. But their relationship grew off the ﬁ  eld.
The two lived together. They went out to-
gether. They pranked teammates together.
Floyd laughed as he recalled pouring ﬂ  our, 
honey and syrup on an unsuspecting Marcus Maye, who was  sleeping shirtless on a couch.
Defensive tackle Damien Jacobs came to his 
locker last season to soaked clothes. He was set to drive home, but didn’t have anything to wear because of Floyd and Easley. Jacobs bor-rowed some threads from the equipment room and still laughs about it to this day.
“Your life is short. You never know when 
you’re going to go,” Easley said. “Just enjoy it, because if you do go, you’ll be happy with it.”
Earlier this year, the two went their separate 
ways.
Floyd declared for the NFL Draft, and Eas-
ley elected to stay for his senior season.
Easley ﬁ  nally had center stage on the defen-
sive line, but he wasn’t completely happy. Not being one of four players — Floyd, Matt Elam, Jelani Jenkins and Jordan Reed — to declare early hurt. He always thought he’d be three years and out.
But he wasn’t ﬁ  nished in Gainesville.Although his senior season did not go as 
planned, Easley has no regrets.
“I was more worried about how my football 
career went. It didn’t go how I wanted it to go,” Easley said. “Everybody’s plan is to do well in college for three years and go to the league. (Now) I would never have wanted it any other way.”�           �               �
Dominique Earl Easley II was born seven 
pounds and 14 ounces on Nov. 4, 2012. He re-cently celebrated his ﬁ  rst birthday. The defen-sive tackle from Staten Island who had worried about the master plan now has to play for two.
“The best thing about fatherhood is seeing 
somebody in you,” Easley said. “You’re sit-ting there watching him thinking, ‘That’s mine. He’s me.’ Just seeing that person you made puts a smile on your face.”
Whether it was the birth of his ﬁ  rst child or 
coming to grips with returning for a senior sea-son, Easley changed in the offseason. But the lighthearted defensive lineman with a heart of gold remained.
Only his perspective changed.A childhood roaming the Staten Island proj-
ects, learning how the world works, made him realize the most important aspects of life aren’t so much the results.
For Easley, there’s a reason for everything.As he has done since growing up in Staten 
Island, Easley will move again — this time to Boca Raton to train for the NFL Draft. Boca, known as a retirement community, won’t be the end for him. Instead, it’s a new beginning.
His latest painful injury is nothing. He’s 
been feeling pain his entire life. He’s not head-ing to the NFL in search of dollars or football immortality. He just wants to take care of his family playing a game he loves.
“It’s Dominique we’re talking about here,” 
Floyd said. “He’ll make it no matter what.”

Trafﬁ  c was rerouted for about two hours Thursday af-
ternoon after a woman ran into a bicyclist with her vehicle 
in front of Cabana Beach Apartments, 1601 SW 51st Ter-race.
At about 3:30 p.m., the driver — a 20-year-old Santa Fe 
College student — was driving home from class when she turned across trafﬁ  c into the entrance of her apartment complex at the intersection of Southwest 20th Avenue and Southwest 62nd Boulevard. She hit a 44-year-old man who was passing through the intersection on his bike. 
Witnesses reported that the trafﬁ  c light was green at 
the time of the collision, wrote Gainesville Police spokes-man Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias in an email. Witnesses also said the man hit the right side of the windshield. He and his bike were thrown over the car. 
The man was taken to the hospital after the crash, and 
Tobias said he may have sustained life-threatening inju-ries. The driver was not harmed.
A few hours after the collision, the bike lay on the rain-
soaked sidewalk near the scene of the crash with orange paint encircling its position.
The driver emerged from an ambulance at about 5:30 
p.m. with tear-swollen eyes, wet hair and trembling hands. 
“She’s just shaken up,” said Carlos Fernandez, the 
driver’s friend and a 21-year-old UF applied physiology and kinesiology junior. “She literally lives right there.”

When about 1,800 Gators walked 
into the Phillips Center for the Per-
forming Arts on Thursday, they had no idea they would be getting a show from both Bill Nye and Neil DeGrasse Tyson.
Nye, a renowned scientist and 
TV personality, was met with mul-tiple standing ovations as he Gator chomped his way into the audience’s hearts.
At the Q-and-A session immedi-
ately following the hour-long talk, a student asked Nye about the scientif-ic accuracy of the movie “Gravity,” a question Nye decided was worthy of an answer from his friend “Dr. T.”
Nye called the 
popular astro-physicist, who was speaking to a crowd at Ohio State University, and 
put him on speak-
erphone, where the pair joked about the two schools and “Gravity.”
Nye concluded his conversa-
tion with a jab at OSU, saying, “If a Buckeye meets a Gator, that’s right: chomp chomp.”
He spoke about telling time on 
earth and beyond, and his father’s obsession with sundials.Bill Nye tells science guys

#UFRising is a go.
On Thursday, the Florida 
Board of Governors greenlit  UF’s Path to Preeminence: a ﬁ  ve-year plan to become a top-10 public research univer-sity.
The board approved the 
preeminent research bench-mark plans for UF and Florida State University, the only state universities that qualiﬁ  ed for the designation of preeminent state research university. UF met all 12 standards speciﬁ  ed in the legislation, and Florida State University met 11.
Upon meeting these bench-
mark plan goals annually, the board will award UF $15 mil-lion each year through funds provided by the General Ap-propriations Act.
UF plans to hire as many as 
100 new distinguished profes-sors who will attract talented graduate assistants and create groundbreaking labs.
The initiative has been 
brewing on the board’s agen-da since Gov. Rick Scott ap-proved the bill in April. 
Board member Patricia 
Frost’s motion to approve the benchmark plans was met by unanimous approval from the board.
After the approval, an 
email sent by UF President Bernie Machen was circulated to students’ emails.
Machen heralded the plan 
and encouraged students, fac-ulty and staff to learn more about UF Rising.
“The facility upgrades will 
improve the UF experience for everyone who socializes at the Reitz Union, visits St. Augustine for the weekend or attends a basketball game or swim meet in the O’Connell Center,” he said.UF ready to rise through the ranks

Some Gainesville bikers are getting 
cranky about Thanksgiving, but it’s OK 
— it’s for charity.
For the ﬁ  rst time, local bike enthusi-
asts can participate Sunday in Cranks-giving, a Thanksgiving rendition of an alleycat scavenger hunt designed to help stock local food banks with Thanksgiv-ing dinners.
Alleycats are scavenger hunts that 
were started by bike messengers as a competition to see who could navigate a city the best.
Registration begins at 2 p.m., one 
hour before the start of the event, at The Kickstand, 1123 SE Fourth St. At 3 p.m. Sunday, bicyclists will receive a list of checkpoint locations. To ﬁ  nish the scav-enger hunt, participants must complete a task at each checkpoint, wrote Eva Suárez, an event organizer, in an email interview.
The required tasks at each location 
are secret, but Suárez said bikers should plan to ride about 10 to 15 miles. She sug-gested participants also wear helmets and bring backpacks and $10 to buy gro-ceries to donate to St. Francis House.
“We’ve got an incredible bike scene 
and supportive community here — the ingredients for a well-attended, fun, lightheartedly competitive race,” Suárez said.
Geoffrey Grooms, a 20-year-old 
Gainesville resident who will be riding in Cranksgiving, said this type of scav-enger hunt is rewarding.
“It’s really challenging because you 
are not given the locations of the check-points, and you are not given the clean-est route,” he said.Holiday bike scavenger hunt

Chris Johns did not know what to expect 
when he went to Hawaii in April. What he 
found was 15 species of moth previously thought to be extinct.
Johns traveled to the Aloha State in an 
attempt to learn more about the Philodoria genus of moths, but wandering around the forest, he said, he didn’t know what to ex-pect.
“It was a fabulous experience,” said the 
25-year-old UF graduate student in the entomology and nematology department.  “At that point, we didn’t know what we were ﬁ  nding.”
While living in a pineapple ﬁ  eld for 
about a month, Johns would search for signs of the moths during the day — sometimes using a helicopter to get to remote areas.
Working with his adviser, Florida Mu-seum of Natural History curator Akito Kawahara,  Johns said the two became the ﬁ  rst people to research the Philodoria ge-nus since 1940.
Johns said during the ﬁ  rst trip, he was 
just hoping to ﬁ  nd that some of the insects were still in existence. The research was funded by grants and some of their per-sonal money.

Once ﬁ  nding a caterpillar that could be 
part of the genus, Johns placed it into a plas-
tic container before it was able to pupate and turn into a moth. The jars must then be kept at cool temperatures, usually on ice in a cooler. Once removed from the cooler, the insects are coated in ethanol in order to per-form DNA transcription in the lab.“At that point, we didn’t know 
what we were ﬁ  nding.”

The Accent Speakers Bureau hosted Bill Nye at the Phillips Center for the Performing 
Arts on Thursday. Nye spoke to a full house about sundials and outer space.
Nye talked climate change, Mars
“Reckoning time has changed the world 
more than the wheel,” he said.
Part of his lecture included his personal 
experiences with Spirit and Opportunity, 
two Mars rovers, the impending issue of climate change and his brief foray into word “invention,” all interspersed with anecdotes from his past and personal life.
The “edutainer” mentioned his electric 
car and solar-paneled home, and his hopes that the world will embrace renewable energy and other “crazy ideas” from stu-dents like those at UF.
“The point is there’s going to be big 
changes, and I want you guys to be a part of it,” Nye said. “It’s up to you guys to — dare I say it — change the world.”
Another student asked Nye about his 
favorite episode of his famous show, “Bill Nye the Science Guy,” but Nye, who was paid $40,000 to speak, said picking a single episode was impossible. However, he said getting to ride in the Blue Angels’ airplane was “pretty cool.”
Steven Ceron, an 18-year-old UF me-
chanical engineering freshman, said he re-members that particular episode and that the rest of Nye’s talk was “incredible” and “very entertaining.”
“I always watched all of his episodes, 
and, now I’m a mechanical engineer,” said the self-professed huge fan of the show.
Many students said Nye was their inspi-
ration to go into STEM ﬁ  elds, and Megan DeBari, a 20-year-old UF biomedical engi-neering sophomore, was no exception.
“It was deﬁ  nitely the beginning of my 
science track,” she said. “He’s really enter-taining, and hearing more about his per-sonal life was really interesting.”BILL , from page 1FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 5
� FIVE OF THE 29 SATELLITES 
LAUNCHED HAVE BEEN REACHED.

Gainesville, we have a problem.
The ﬁ  rst opportunity for UF’s ground team 
to make contact with SwampSat, a 4-by-4-by-4 inch satellite, passed by at 8 p.m. Wednesday with no peep from The Gator Nation’s ﬁ  rst step into space. 
SwampSat, the ﬁ  rst picosatellite developed 
by researchers at the UF College of Engineer-ing, was carried into space from a NASA facil-ity in Virginia aboard a Minotaur 1 spacecraft Tuesday.
Norman Fitz-Coy, a UF 
associate professor of me-chanical and aerospace en-gineering, said only ﬁ  ve of the 29 satellites on board the 
rocket have been reached. Much like a mother look-ing for her child in daycare, 
it is difﬁ  cult to parse through all of the satel-lites’ signals being broadcasted.
“Basically, we’re looking for a needle in a 
haystack,” Fitz-Coy said. “If we hear from 28 and still haven’t heard from ours, then we’ll get worried.”
The 29 satellites deployed from the rocket must spread out before SwampSat’s signal can overpower the crowd’s noise — a process that could take hours or weeks. Students from the college are manning the ground station by UF’s solar farm, where an antenna has been erected for communication with the satellite.
Fitz-Coy said SwampSat, which weighs 
1.26 kilograms, was developed as a technol-ogy demonstrator to prove the capabilities of smaller form-factor satellites. It employs a con-troller movement gyro to provide rapid retar-geting and precision pointing, similar to how a photographer can refocus a lens on a new subject. The roughly $250,000 satellite was in development for about two years before con-tracting a spot on the Minotaur 1 as part of NASA’s educational launch of nanosatellites program, which partners with universities to charter rides into space for their small research satellites free of charge.
SwampSat’s stated mission life is six 
months, but Fitz-Coy said as long as the sat-ellite is active, UF researchers will continue to collect data from it. After the satellite loses functionality, it will return to Earth and burn up on re-entry into the atmosphere.
Krystal Ashman, a 20-year-old UF political 
science junior, was surprised she hadn’t heard about the satellite sooner.
“It’s a satellite developed and built by UF 
and launched into space,” she said. “That’s kind of a big deal.”
UF’s first satellite launched into space remains silent

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgThursday’s question: Does science rule?Today’s question: Do you think UF can become a top 
10 university?Not your mother’s Plato: Philosophy matters
As the end of my ﬁ  nal semester at UF approaches 
and one of my many ambitions comes to fruition, I ﬁ  nd myself constantly reﬂ  ecting on an eventful 
college experience.
When I tell someone I’m graduating this year, they 
often respond by asking me practical questions such as whether I can recommend any “easy” courses to take or who the “easy” professors are. 
It is this sort of “easy” line of questioning to which I 
possess no answer, as each student has his or her own study habits and preferences, tailored to a very speciﬁ  c type of major.
Instead, I try to lure them into the very discipline 
that has taught me to question and doubt everything — a habit, which I am obliged to warn you, can prove irritating during an exam. 
Yes, I am talking about philosophy: that which too 
often evokes images of old men debating in ancient Greek garb and thinkers sitting around with their chins perched on their hands, pondering the existential questions of life.
Stereotypes aside, philosophy is far from useless. In fact, devoting your time and energy to relentless 
inquiry can actually be quite practical. 
In a philosophy class, a new brand of writing will 
be demanded of you, one that critically evaluates other people’s ideas as well as your own.
Professors will force you to think extensively about 
the subject at hand and help you write in a manner that is clear and succinct. 
You will also read voraciously, and as a consequence, 
you will become familiar with a number of themes and historical ﬁ  gures in the interest of context.
Over the course of my undergraduate career, 
I’ve taken philosophy classes concerning subjects as diverse as politics, religion and morality and was lucky enough to have been introduced to thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Locke, Nietzsche, Sartre and — to save the best for last — Hume, who once said, “All sentiment is right; because sentiment has a reference to nothing beyond itself, and is always real, wherever a man is conscious of it. But all determinations of 
the understanding are not right; because they have a reference to something beyond themselves, to wit, real matter of fact; and are not always conformable to that standard.”
Whether you’re an aspiring doctor, law student, 
engineer, journalist or simply a lover of wisdom, the truth is that philosophy is valuable beyond measure. 
It is no wonder, then, that the third most-popular 
class at Harvard University is a philosophy class.
Michael Puett, the professor of Classical Chinese 
Ethical and Political Theory at Harvard claims “this course will change your life,” according to The Atlantic.
Similarly, between 2001 and 2011, the number of 
philosophy majors at the University of California, Berkeley rose by 74 percent. 
These students have realized the beneﬁ  t of taking 
philosophy classes, as they can be applied to virtually any major.
Although I may not be the best philosopher or even label 
the love of wisdom as an “easy” discipline, I do recognize 
that critical inquiry is as rewarding as it is tedious.
So, the next time you are up late, coffee in hand, with 
your eyes keenly pasted to ISIS, consider a class or even 
a minor in philosophy.
It may change the way you live.   Richard Vieira is a UF political science senior. His

Darts & Laurels
They say there are just three constants in life: death, taxes 
and s**tty blogs. It seems a new poorly written article about sexuality, race, class or gender rises every day. The cycle typically follows as such: Reactionary article is written by an unknown online “publication,” people on social media go crazy, The Atlantic writes a think piece about it, and every-one forgets. This week, however, one blogger published a reactionary piece of crap we can’t ignore.
This week, we’re throwing a DART to the “writer” be-
hind the piece “5 Reasons to Date a Girl with an Eating Disorder.” It’s obviously revolting, but what was discon-
certing was the writer’s assertion that eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia are diseases of the privileged — a “luxury.”
Eating disorders are serious mental illnesses, often tied 
with anxiety, depression and body dysmorphia. They are symptoms of a larger, overarching problem not just for indi-vidual women, but for a culture that values a narrow, unat-tainable beauty ideal. Pasty bloggers, be gone.
Continuing in health news, we’re handing off a let’s-get-
physical LAUREL to the Bill and Melinda Gates Founda-
tion, which is hosting a condom-design competition through their Grand Challenges Explorations program. The winning groups can apply for a $1 million grant to scale up produc-tion of their design. The idea behind the competition is to promote safe sex in order to prevent transmission of STDs. Some of the promising designs include condoms with pull tabs, so the user pulls it on like a sock rather than rolling it on and a condom using beef tendons as part of the material.
According to NPR, “The result, [Mark McGlothlin of 
Apex Medical Technologies Inc.] says, is a material that al-most feels like wet skin. ‘It’s a totally different sensation than a latex condom. It’s like rubbing your hand on a real leather car seat versus one with fake leather. The fake fabric — and the latex — just feels bad.’”
Speaking of sexy times and sexy sex, People magazine re-
leased its 2013 pick for Sexiest Man Alive. While we at the Alligator were pulling for Chris Hemsworth, Pharrell Wil-liams, Aaron Paul or Justin Timberlake, People’s pick was — record scratch — Adam No-Lips Levine. Although Levine is the ﬁ  rst musician to make the list and a break from the cookie-cutter likes of past winners like Bradley Cooper and Channing Tatum, we and the Internet can’t help but feel let down. A where’s-your-imagination DART to People maga-
zine.
And ﬁ  nally, a LAUREL to you, reader. You endured a 
semester that included a government shutdown, a painful football season, a rocky universal health care rollout and Twerkgate, and you handled it with grace and aplomb.
Happy pre-Thanksgiving Break, y’all. You stay classy, 
Gainesville.

You’re 13. You just got 
out of the sixth grade, and it’s growing 
harder and harder to hide your anxiety about diving into both geometry and puberty next year. You’re hoping to ﬁ  nally crack that 5-foot height barrier by the time you hit high school, and you’re still trying to for-get about last week — when your aunt called and thought you were your much younger sister.
Growing up is hard. It’s nice that our 
youth can kick back with Laffy Taffy and a ﬂ  ick laden with copious bloodshed — relieve the stress through some good ol’ fashioned catharsis.
That’s what today’s PG-13 movies are 
allowing our youth to do. A recent study reported by NPR found that gun vio-lence in today’s PG-13 movies has more than tripled since 1985.
The Motion Picture Association of 
America’s ratings system began us-ing PG-13 ratings in 1984. According to CNN, PG-13 tells parents “some mate-rial (in the ﬁ  lm) may be inappropriate for pre-teenagers.”
Just for some perspective, Ron How-
ard’s “Cocoon” came out in 1985. It was rated PG-13. It contained no gun vio-lence, and the rating was mostly given for a scene that shows a woman strip-ping down to her undergarments.
This year, in stark contrast, made way 
for “Iron Man 3,” which features scores of terrorists ﬁ  ring automatic weapons on defenseless villagers and homelands. One guy ﬁ  res a bullet into a photograph of the president’s head.
It’s tough to recall a ﬁ  lm that doesn’t 
contain any gun violence or an allusion to gun violence. Or a gun, even. Mov-ies that are rated PG-13 are typically the highest-grossing ﬁ  lms of the year, according to Nielsen’s 2012 American Moviegoing Report.
Think “The Dark Knight.” Think “The Avengers” and even  “Iron Man 3.” Think movies that you and I, collegiate 20-somethings, still ﬁ  nd grossly entertaining.
That’s arguably what’s most strange 
about this study. On the surface, it’s say-ing ﬁ  lms our 13-year-olds are allowed to see are corrupt with gun violence. That in itself is an issue, but that’s not the big-ger message sent to us by these statistics.
It’s the fact that all of us — not just 13-
year-olds, but anybody above 13 — are demanding triple the amount of gun vio-lence our predecessors demanded just 28 years ago.
Films wouldn’t be rich with violence 
if it weren’t something that was work-ing for them. Hollywood is a business. They’re going to do whatever makes them the most money.
You and I aren’t strangers to gun 
violence. We’re college students, and in 2013, it seems like we’re faced every day with the risk of seeing our own col-lege campus on CNN. The kind of news we’re bombarded with has forced us to become desensitized to gun violence, ei-ther as a coping mechanism or as simply a natural progression.
Regardless of why, that news has be-
come a part of our day-to-day routine. We wake up, grab a meal and check our mobile notiﬁ  cations for the day’s latest tragedy before making our way to class.
If our lives are dominated by gun 
violence, it’s only ﬁ  tting that violence would eventually come to dominate the very things — movies — that were once meant to provide escape.
Maybe that’s why movies have ad-
opted so much gun violence — because all of us have regarded gun violence as an indubitable presence in even the most ﬁ  ctional of worlds.

UWire Obamacare has been a con-
troversial policy since its inception in 2009, but now, 
one particular advertisement cre-ated for the Thanks Obamacare! campaign has been drawing scrutiny.
The ad features a young woman stand-
ing next to a young man, excitedly brandish-ing a package of birth control pills. The ad’s copy, presumably from the point of view of the young woman, reads, “Let’s Get Physical: OMG, he’s hot! Let’s hope he’s as easy to get as this birth control. My health insurance covers the pill, which means all I have to worry about is getting him between the covers.”
This ad came out hot on the heels of another 
ad spot by the same groups, titled “Brosur-ance,” in which college-age men doing keg stands express gratitude that their health care costs won’t cut into their beer money.
These ads have been subject to both criticism 
and defense since they were released by Got Insurance?, a project of the Thanks Obamacare! campaign funded by two advocacy groups. In a congressional hearing on Obamacare’s botched rollout, Rep. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) slammed U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius for the Brosurance ad — despite the fact that Sebelius was not in-volved in the ad’s creation — and liberal Slate magazine rushed to the defense of the ads after conservative commentator Rush Limbaugh at-tacked them as promoting promiscuity.
Given the politicization of Obamacare, it’s 
not surprising the conversation about these ads turned into partisan attacks. But what is concerning is the lack of attention paid to the portrayal of young people in the ads.
Young people as a group have not tradi-
tionally spent a lot on health insurance, but Obamacare aims to change that. According to an article this month from Time magazine, in order for the individual mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act to work, 2.7 million out of the 7 million people who sign up for Obamacare need to be young people who will, on average, put more money into the system than they get out of it. Looking at these statistics, it’s understandable why a state health care exchange feels the need to appeal directly to the young. But the way the Got 
Insurance? campaign trivializes the health care needs of young adults is unacceptable.
These ads portray college-age individuals 
as a demographic driven entirely by their most basic impulses. Instead of paying attention to actual portrayals of the young who need health insurance, the Colorado Consumer Health Ini-tiative and ProgressNow Colorado Education made the disappointing choice to focus on crass caricatures straight out of MTV reality shows.
Real college-age people can be bankrupted 
by accidents, diseases and assaults, and it does those people a disservice to be portrayed as idi-ots whose actions are governed solely by sex and alcohol.
ProgressNow Colorado director Amy Ru-
nyon-Harms told The Denver Post, “The whole intention of these ads is to raise awareness, and that’s what we’re doing. It’s great that more and more people are talking about it.”
It’s ﬁ  ne that Runyon-Harms wants to raise 
awareness about health insurance for young people, but several of the ads released de-emphasize the reasons why it’s important for everyone to have insurance and instead paint college students in broad, unﬂ  attering strokes. Although we don’t live within the scope of the Colorado state health exchange, it’s problem-atic that any inﬂ  uential person thinks young people will be motivated by messages about al-cohol and sex more than any other sentiment.
Health insurance is a real issue. People on college campuses across the 
country need to demand a more delicate and respectful approach to the issues that face young people if we want the national percep-tion of youth to evolve beyond the lowest com-mon denominator.

Guests dine at a Thanksgiving-style feast Thursday evening at Gainesville’s American Cancer 
Society Winn-Dixie Hope Lodge. Winn-Dixie hosted the dinner.

MCKENZIE COLLARD
Alligator Contributing Writer
Twenty-seven years ago, a gro-
cery store chain funded the building 
of Gainesville’s American Cancer Society Winn-Dixie Hope Lodge for cancer patients and their families. On Thursday night, the same chain provided its ﬁ  rst Thanksgiving din-ner for current residents.
Winn-Dixie Stores partnered 
with the American Cancer Society to offer a home-cooked Thanksgiv-ing dinner that was donated by lo-cal stores and prepared by a Winn-Dixie employee, said Allen Reavis, region vice president of operations for the chain.
About 100 patients and family 
members lined up for the meal that included stufﬁ  ng, mashed potatoes, collard greens and plenty of tur-key. Hope Lodge Director Nancy 
Dohn said Winn-Dixie sponsored the construction of Gainesville’s lodge in 1986.
“It’s not just a free place to stay, 
but it’s being able to stay some-place with people who are going through exactly what you are going through,” she said. “You can’t put a price on that.”
John Messner, the chef, said ev-
erything is worth it once he sees pa-tients smile. He said he likes to help out whenever he can and jumps on opportunities to volunteer.
“It’s instant gratiﬁ  cation when 
you serve people food,” he said.
Beverly Manning has lived at the 
Lodge for seven months as caretak-er for her mother, who has lung can-cer. She said events like the dinner make it a home away from home.

she said. Cancer patients celebrate

� PARRISH RAN CAREER-BEST IN REGIONAL.
JORDAN MCPHERSON 
Alligator Writer @J_McPherson1126
Mark Parrish will take the helm for the Gators one 
last time.
After winning the South Regional Championship 
race on Nov. 15, and being named USTFCCCA South 
Region Men’s Athlete of the Year on Tuesday, the senior will lead Florida’s cross country team at the NCAA Championships in Terre Haute, Ind., on Sat-urday at noon.
Parrish paced the Gators in three of the ﬁ  ve meets 
he’s competed in this season, most recently leading Florida to its second-place team ﬁ  nish in the 10K NCAA regional race. He ran a career-best 29:44.24.
“I was really happy with the performance just be-
cause it indicates that I have really good ﬁ  tness,” the Tampa native said. 
“I got a nice, rested race at [the South Regional 
Championship] and it turned out really well, so I’m hoping for a real good performance at nationals.”
Florida’s men will be represented as a team at the 
national meet for the ﬁ  rst time since 2011.
UF had a poor outing that year, ﬁ  nishing 30th out 
of 31 teams. Even though Parrish led the Gators with a 68th-place ﬁ  nish, no one else on the team placed above 191st in the 252-competitor ﬁ  eld.
Coach Paul Spangler hopes for better results this 
time around. 
With consistent performances throughout the 
season from their three All-South Region runners — Parrish, Jimmy Clark and Eddie Garcia — and SEC All-Freshman Carlos Miranda, Spangler is working to make sure the team is set for Saturday’s 10K at the Wabash Valley Family Sports Center.
“Right now, it’s just a matter of recovering from (the South Regional Championship) and not pressing them too hard,” he said. 
“We’re going into this weekend well-rested.”
Florida will be one of six South-
eastern Conference teams partici-pating in the meet on the men’s side, with Arkansas and Georgia qualifying as teams for winning the 
South Central and South regions, respectively. Au-burn, Tennessee and Texas A&M each have one run-ner competing as an individual.
In addition to the men’s squad, redshirt junior 
Cory McGee and redshirt senior Agata Strausa will represent Florida as individual runners in the NCAA Championships after the women’s team fell short of qualifying for nationals.
The team failed to clinch an automatic berth when 
it ﬁ  nished fourth at the South Regional Champion-ships and found out Saturday that they did not re-ceive one of the 13 at-large team bids.
“It’s tough that we haven’t been able to put it to-
gether and make it (to the NCAA Championships) this year,” McGee said.
“I think we have the talent and have what it takes 
to be there competing, so to come in fourth doesn’t really do us justice. It doesn’t show how good of a team we really have.”
McGee, who ran her best 6K at the South Regional 
Championships en route to a second-place individu-al ﬁ  nish, is hoping to improve on her last outing at the NCAA Championships, when she failed to ﬁ  nish the 6K course in 2011.
“I want to get into the race and be comfortable and 
surround myself with girls I know I can race with and compete with and believe I can beat,” McGee said. 
“I think if I do that and latch onto the people I 
believe I’m able to run with, then that’s the best thing I can do.”FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 13

Brand Picks Column are ex-traordinarily excited for this 
weekend. For the Georgia Southern-Florida game, you ask? Of course not. The second installment of the ‘Hunger Games’ series, “Catching Fire” pre-miered last night at midnight! If that doesn’t get your heart pumping, then we don’t know what’s wrong with you. Just watch the trailer, for crying out loud!
If you have been living under a rock 
and don’t already know the basic plot of the series, it’s basically this: In a dys-topian future, children from regions that rebelled against the government are forced to fight to the death for the enjoyment of the ruling class. Messed up, right? Well, the main protagonist, Katniss Everdeen, competes in one of those games and (Spoiler alert!) wins. Now, the government is all mad at her for surviving, and that’s where this movie picks up.
When you think about it, the South-
eastern Conference is a lot like The Hunger Games. Fourteen teams enter the season, all with an equal (Ha!) shot at a conference title. But by December, those 14 teams have been whittled down to two, and those lucky squads engage in a brutal, no-holds-barred fight to the death. The winner likely destined for the national title game, the loser — well, just ask Georgia how that worked for them.
As we wind down this season, only 
13 games separate first and last place in the picks column. It’s a fight to the death up in here! May the spreads be ever in your favor.
This week, we have Joe Morgan and 
Adam Lichtenstein as tributes fighting over the Arizona State-UCLA matchup this weekend.
Arizona State (-3) will Katniss the 
Everdeen out of UCLA because...
Jennifer Lawrence. I don’t have 
time to write this. I’m going to see the movie.

Patric Young dunks the ball during Florida’s 79-59 victory against Middle 
Tennessee on Thursday in the O’Connell Center. Young had 16 points.

Alligator Staff Writer @LandonWatnick
Without freshman point guard Kasey Hill (high ankle 
sprain), the Gators struggled to play organized on the offen-
sive end early Thursday night. But they eventually figured it out and cruised to a big win.
Six players scored in double figures for No. 16 Florida 
(4-1) as it defeated Middle Tennessee 79-59 in the O’Connell Center.
“We pulled together,” sophomore DeVon Walker said. 
“That’s great basketball. Everybody’s eating bread — that’s what I call it.”
Added senior center Patric Young: “We were very confi-
dent with what we had out there. … We have so many weap-ons. Even without our point guard, we could still distribute the ball and finish and score buckets and get fouled.”
Young led the way with 16 points — 12 coming in the 
first half — six rebounds and a team-best three assists, while Dorian Finney-Smith added 14 points.
“I thought Patric Young did a great job tonight,” coach 
Billy Donovan said. “I thought he set the tone defensively. He was active.”
The Gators did not have Hill — who suffered a high 
ankle sprain in Monday’s game against Southern and will miss at least a month of action — running the offense, but they managed to shoot 50 percent from the field. UF also found success from the free-throw line, shooting 25 of 30. 
But Florida failed to find rhythm offensively in the 
game’s opening minutes. After the first 10 minutes of play, Florida had shot only 4 of 16 and led 9-5.
“There was a little bit of nerves going on early,” Young 
said. “We weren’t moving the ball well.”
Entering halftime with a 34-26 lead, Florida had recorded 
only two assists against four turnovers. 
“In the first half, we got really stagnant,” Donovan said. 
“We got too bogged down trying to figure out their 1-3-1 zone.
“It was painful to watch.”But after the first half, the Gators went on a tear.A dunk by Young, two three-point plays by Jacob Kurtz 
and Finney-Smith and a layup by Michael Frazier II in tran-sition fueled a 12-0 run by the Gators over 2:38 to take a 49-30 advantage with 15:16 in the second half.
From that point until the end of the contest, Florida led Young dominant as Gators cruise to win

The Seminoles gave the Gators a taste of 
their own medicine on Thursday night in the 
O’Connell Center.
Florida State needed only seven women to 
get the job done in a 76-68 victory over Florida, with four of them scoring in double digits. 
“In our eyes, we lost the toughness battle 
in parts of the game tonight in parts of the game,” coach Amanda Butler said. “Not the entire game. There were certainly bright spots. I think we played hard, but there’s a difference between playing hard and playing tough.”
The first half was a sloppy one for both 
teams. The Gators and the Seminoles shot a com-
bined 4 of 22 in the first seven minutes. A Ja-terra Bonds layup capped the stretch, putting UF ahead 6-5.
Then Florida increased its lead when Cass-
ie Peoples hit a three pointer to increase the margin to 9-5 — the Gators’ largest lead of the night. 
At halftime, Florida State led 34-29. Florida 
was shooting 25.9 percent from the field while Florida State was shooting 35.7 percent.
Early in the second half, the game started to 
slip away from the Gators. With 10 minutes re-maining, the Seminoles were up 58-42. 
Then, Ronni Williams showed up. Williams dominated the floor, posting an-other double-double with 14 points and 12 re-bounds in 24 minutes. 
The Gators were down six points with 48 
seconds remaining when Williams fouled out for the fourth consecutive game. 
“It’s just growing pains for Ronni,” But-
ler said. “I thought she had some tough calls, in fairness to her. But, that’s going to happen. That’s part of the game.”
“That being said, you can’t put yourself in 
position with the silly fouls. (Williams) is learn-ing that the hard way. The game was called very close. 
“That’s the way the game’s being called. 
She has to continue to adjust and find ways to Florida falls to in-state rival Florida State
see WHooPs, P age 15improve because, obviously, she’s very 
important to us. Her presence was deﬁ  -nitely felt and it was missed when she wasn’t on the ﬂ  oor.”
Compared to last year’s game in Tal-
lahassee, Florida showed great improve-ment this time around. 
January Miller played one of her best 
game of the season, shooting 70 percent from the ﬁ  eld while scoring 19 points. 
“We have the potential, but we never 
ﬁ  nished through,” Miller said. “We just have to have that extra ounce of ﬁ  ght to ﬁ  nish out these games. We’re just as good as any of these teams if we just fought more.”
Added Butler: “Jan shot the ball 
great. She gave us a great spark. Ronni’s consistency in terms of being able to de-liver a double-double. I thought Jaterra (Bonds) was really trying to push the tempo and created some good things for us in pockets.”
Florida now prepares to face unde-
feated St. John’s on Tuesday night in Gainesville. 
In the meantime, Butler and her team 
are focused on cleaning up a few aspects of their game. 
“There’s two trends that, when we’ve 
played tough teams, we’ve got to be bet-ter at,” she said. 
“That’s on the defensive end of the 
ﬂ  oor. You can’t give up 76 points, espe-cially on your home ﬂ  oor. We’ve also got to play with a lot more composure. Way too many turnovers that I didn’t necessarily feel like we were forced into. Just some bad decisions and a little bit of panic.”FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 22, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 15

� MANN HOLDS NCAA RECORD 
FOR HITTING PERCENTAGE.
RJ SCHAFFER
Alligator Writer @rjschaffer 
There have been few things Chloe 
Mann has not accomplished in her ca-
reer.  
The middle blocker is the current all-
time NCAA leader in hitting percentage, has won two Southeastern Conference titles and is a reigning 2012 AVCA First-Team All-American. 
Setter Taylor Brauneis also has im-
pressive accomplishments under her belt since she transferred from Louisville af-ter her sophomore year. 
She was named AVCA Honorable 
Mention All-American last year and led the SEC with 11.65 assists per set. Brau-neis is currently 14th in the nation with 11.45 assists per set and is second on the team in service aces.
As No. 7 Florida (25-3, 14-2 SEC) pre-
pares to take on LSU (16-10, 6-8 SEC) to-night at 7, it will be the last time Mann and fellow senior Brauneis play in the O’Connell Center in the regular season in their historic careers. “It’s been a long, exciting, wild, crazy 
ride,” Mann said.  “It’s deﬁ  nitely reward-ing to know that all of this accumulation of everything I’ve worked so hard for since I ﬁ  rst started playing volleyball is coming to fruition tomorrow night.” 
Gators fans are not just getting to see 
the end of potentially Mann’s most suc-cessful season but also the end of argu-ably one of the most dominant careers in program history. 
Mann has found a way to take her 
game to an even higher level this season. 
She currently leads the NCAA with a 
hitting percentage of .508. She is hitting .100 better than Alex Holston, the next closest teammate.
“There are times as a coach that you 
wish you had a pause button on their ca-reers,” coach Mary Wise said. 
 “Ask any coach in the country if you 
lost the all-time career hitting efﬁ  ciency leader ever in the sport of women’s vol-leyball; that’s hard to replace, and she’s left her mark on this program.” 
Wise said any list containing the 
most successful athletes to come out of the Gainesville would have to include Mann.

Kelvin Taylor is used to setting 
high standards.
Two years ago, he broke Em-
mitt Smith’s 25-year old Florida 
high school career rushing re-cord. Now, after initially having his playing time limited, the Belle Glade native has ﬁ  rmly estab-lished himself as the Gators’ start-ing tailback and has rushed for more yards than UF true freshman since 2008.
“I’m excited about Kelvin,” of-
fensive coordinator Brent Pease said. “I think he’s really come on with the game experience.”
Taylor will have more oppor-
tunities to run the football when Florida (4-6, 3-5 Southeastern Conference) takes on Georgia Southern (6-4, 4-4 Southern Con-ference) due to UF’s lack of depth at quarterback. 
Starter Tyler Murphy (shoul-
der) missed Florida’s 19-14 loss against No. 11 South Carolina, and redshirt freshman Skyler Morn-hinweg took his place.
With the inexperienced Morn-
hinweg at quarterback, UF ran the ball on 41 of 55 plays. Taylor re-ceived 21 of those carries, running for a career-high 96 yards and two touchdowns.
“He’s ran very well in his oppor-
tunities,” coach Will Muschamp said after the game. “He continues to mature at the position. He car-ries himself very well.”
Taylor needed to mature quick-
ly. Florida’s running backs have not been immune to the injury bug that has circulated around the team this season.
Starting running back Matt Jones suffered a season-ending meniscus tear against LSU on Oct. 12, and Taylor has received more carries since then. 
After getting only six carries in 
Florida’s ﬁ  rst ﬁ  ve games — includ-ing no touches in three of them — Taylor has averaged 15.4 carries in the Gators’ past ﬁ  ve games.
“He’s starting because he’s the 
best guy on our team right now,” Pease said.
Taylor has arguably been Flor-
ida’s best running back all season. The freshman has run for an aver-age of 4.7 yards per carry — the most of any Gator with more than 15 rushing attempts.
Mack Brown, who started in 
Jones’ absence in UF’s season opener, looked to be Jones’ re-placement after the sophomore’s season-ending injury. But Taylor’s success and Brown’s struggles led to the freshman taking over the role. 
Brown leads Florida in carries 
and rushing yards but trails Tay-lor in yards per carry by a yard.
“When I went down in the Mis-
souri game the role kind of went to Kelvin,” Brown said. “So now I’m just doing my job, you know. Got to run the ball and just stay healthy and contribute to the team.”
Said Pease: “[Brown is] come 
out to work every day. If you don’t like the situation, help change your role.”
Brown said he had no qualms 
playing behind a freshman, espe-cially because Florida needs two running backs to carry the load due to an increase in rushing at-tempts.
“I was excited, man, running 
the ball every play,” Brown said. “That’s what every running back likes. Down hill run game, power running, just get your feet hot, re-ally.”
Brown had a decent game 
against South Carolina as well. He ran for 51 yards on 11 carries — good for 4.6 yards per carry, the same as Taylor.
The Gators need Brown to 
supplement Taylor because, while the freshman has been successful, he is not a complete running back. Taylor, coming off the best game of his short college career, still has room to improve. He’ll look to do that against Georgia Southern’s defensive line.
“When you go back and look 
at the ﬁ  lm,” Pease said, “there’s still spots where you say ‘Here’s what you need to do, here’s what you need to understand more. You need to run harder through this tackle, you need to break this tackle.’”
But while Taylor may not be a 
complete running back now, Pease said that day is coming soon.
“I want to see him in his third 
or fourth year,” Pease said. 
“He’s going to probably be out-
standing.”

in his third or fourth year. 
He’s going to probably be 
outstanding.”
