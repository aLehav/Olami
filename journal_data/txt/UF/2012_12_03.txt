The Stephen C. O’Connell 
Center may soon get a $50 
million renovation, pending 
approval from UF’s Board of 
Trustees at its meeting Thurs-day.
The board will vote on 
whether the university should pay $10 million for the face-lift. The University Athletic Association would solicit the rest of the money, UF spokes-
man Steve Orlando said.
The proposed renovations 
would include a new en-
trance, a club space and more 
concession stands and gift 
stores, he said. The arena’s infrastructure would also be redone, more video boards installed and the bleachers 
replaced with permanent 
seating.
Orlando said the univer-
sity would support the make-
over, because the O’Connell 
Center is also used for educa-tional purposes. He said the proposed $10 million would not come from state funds or 
tuition.
Orlando said there is no 
timetable set for the comple-
tion of the project if it is 
passed, because it relies heav-ily on fundraising.
The O’Connell Center 
was completed in 1980 and 
renovated in 1998 with a new 
roof and updated sound and 
lighting systems, according to the UF Foundation website. Other improvements came in 1999 and included upgrades 
to the restrooms.
Stephen C. O’Connell was 
UF’s president from 1967 to 
1973, according to the web-
site, and the arena was dedi-
cated in his honor in 1981.
“The O’Connell Center 
name is going to remain,” Or-
lando said. 
“There are 
no plans to 
change
it.”
Com-
puter and 
e l e c t r i c a l engineering 
senior and Rowdy Reptiles 
president Jake Sillick, 24, said 
he is concerned the perma-nent seating would restrict the amount of people who 
ﬁ  t in the lower-level student 
section.
“We have a unique seating 
arrangement by being on the sidelines,” Sillick said. “We 
are so close to the action — I O’Connell Center 
could get renovationSCIENCE

Space’s mysteries continue to bafﬂ  e sci-
entists across the nation as NASA ﬁ  nds ice 
on Mercury.
Tests run by NASA’s MESSENGER 
spacecraft, which arrived on Mercury last year, show there may be several inches of ice insulated by carbon-based organic ma-terial deep in northern craters, according to a NASA news release.
While the presence of water on the planet was predicted for decades, said Haywood 
Smith, UF associate professor of astronomy, 
the conﬁ  rmation — as well as the discov-
ery of the organic material that could be the 
building blocks of life — is a major ﬁ  nd.
NASA estimates about 1 trillion tons of 
ice are among the craters that dot Mercury’s Northern pole.
Although Mercury’s surface reaches a 
molten 800 degrees Fahrenheit thanks to its solar neighbor, the planet hardly tilts, and 
its atmosphere is extremely thin, the release stated. 
These factors mean the 
inside of the polar craters 
do not see sunlight. 
The temperatures in 
the constantly shady spac-
es get as chilly as -350 de-
grees Fahrenheit.
“It’s similar to how 
they found unexpectedly large amounts of water on the moon a while ago,” Smith 
said. “It has been theorized to be a possibility 
but deﬁ  nitely not something expected.”
The organic molecules that cushion some 
of the ice contains carbon — a necessary el-
ement for life, according to the release.
Haywood said that while the discovery 
is signiﬁ  cant, he doesn’t expect life to be discovered there.
“Organic molecules are thought to be 
pretty common in meteorites,” Smith said. “Maybe less so on the comets that would be 
carrying the water.”NASA discovers ice on the planet closest to the sun

Dallas Mavericks owner Mark 
Cuban will speak at 8 p.m. at the 
Curtis M. Phillips Center for the 
Performing Arts.
Cuban accumulated a $2.5 bil-
lion net worth through his Mav-
ericks ownership and work with 
businesses including a television 
channel and a pizza franchise.
“Entrepreneurs like Mark Cu-
ban inspire me, because he really came from nothing,” said 21-year-
old economics junior Davis Harper. 
“He breaks the stereotype that the ultra-rich all inherit their wealth.”
Josh Holtzman, Accent Speak-
er’s Bureau chairman, said Cu-
ban’s story is relatable to many 
students at UF.
“We do our best to select speak-
ers that appeal to a variety of stu-
dents,” Holtzman said. “Mr. Cu-
ban’s achievements are relevant to business students but also  sports fans interested in technology or communications.”
Telecommunication junior Nick 
Swain said he will attend the event to hear Cuban’s honesty.
“He doesn’t really carry himself 
how a typical NBA owner would, and I like that. I respect that,” said Swain, 20. “I hope he says some-thing in relation to how he main-
tained his own personality through 
everything he’s accomplished.”
Doors will open at 7 p.m. Admission is free, but tickets 
are required and will be avail-able to the public when the doors open.Dallas Mavericks owner to speak tonight

In Memory
Summer Jupin, 25, lights candles Saturday at the Institute of Black Culture during the 
candlelight vigil for Jordan Davis, a Jacksonville teen who was shot and killed Nov. 23. 
Dec. 5, 1988 — Two members of the Ku Klux Klan, a Grand Dragon and Great Titan, 
visited UF on a recruitment tour of Florida. When they stopped in front of the Institute 
of Black Culture, a crowd of about 30 hecklers gathered. One woman grabbed the Great Titan’s hat, threw it on the ground and yelled “Bigot.” The Klansmen were unfazed and continued down West University Avenue. The Grand Wizard claimed the Klan 
promoted the freedom of America and that they came to the school to teach people that 
races were not meant to be mixed.
Dec. 8, 1999 — A student’s art project promoted the Turlington Rock’s “potato” 
nickname. Justin Valiquette was inspired by artist Christo, who is known for his wrap-ping of buildings and statues. Valiquette and a group of fellow art students “trans-formed” the rock by covering it in tinfoil and surrounding it with heat lamps. 
Dec. 5, 2005 — UF’s Board of Trustees voted to extend the employee health care 
benefits to all independent couples. This meant that gay and lesbian partners of em-ployees would be covered by the university’s health insurance. UF was the first Florida public school to offer the benefits, joining about 295 universities nationwide.

A Gainesville man accused of punching a 
police officer at a downtown nightclub was ar -
rested early Friday morning.
Police arrested Drew Carlton, 21, of 5616 
NW 42nd Road, on a charge of battery on a 
law enforcement officer, a third-degree felony , 
according to a Gainesville Police arrest report.At about 1 a.m. Friday, GPD received a call 
from :08 nightclub staff members about a man 
telling patrons he was armed with a .45-caliber 
handgun.
When police arrived at the club, at 201 W. 
University Ave., officers met with Carlton, who is a paramedic, and patted him down for the weapon, according to the report.
Police did not find the gun and told Carlton 
the staff wanted him to leave. Carlton became agitated and refused to leave the property.
After police told him 
five times to leave, Carlton 
left while cursing at the officers. Police confronted Carlton again and told him to calm down, warning him that he would be arrested.
Carlton approached the officer, clenching his fists, and raised his arms as if he was going to strike the officer, according to the report.
The officer pushed away Carlton, who re-
sponded by punching the officer in the throat.
Police arrested Carlton and booked him 
into the Alachua County Jail at 1:43 a.m. Fri-day . He was released later that afternoon on his own recognizance.

Gainesville residents gather as Mayor Craig Lowe lights the city Christmas tree Saturday night 
at the Thomas Center. The Holiday Tree Lighting Celebration was free and open to the public.
 �ABOUT 800 PEOPLE ATTENDED.

Alligator Contributing Writer
Mayor Craig Lowe counted down 
from three. Christmas carolers held their 
hymnals. Children waited, their eyes 
wide with wonder.
And in an instant, hundreds of little 
lights ﬂ  ooded the Thomas Center atrium 
with an icy-blue glow.
About 800 people attended the city’s 
annual Holiday Tree Lighting Celebra-tion Saturday at the center, 302 NE Sixth Ave. Gainesville Regional Utilities and the Thomas Center sponsored the free 
festival.
After the mayor lit the tree, families 
huddled around it to pose for pictures. 
Children reached to touch the shiny orbs 
that hung from its branches.
Little kids lined up, eager to speak 
with Santa Claus. Red-faced and cheery, 
he hugged them and laughed, listening to their wishes.
Madison Sprague, 1, waited her turn. 
Donning a red velvet dress trimmed with white ﬂ  uff, her mom said she was excited to see the man she dressed to match.
“It was her ﬁ  rst time seeing Santa,” 
said her mom, Julie Sprague, 34. “It was 
great.”
Luminaries lit the way for horse-
drawn carriage rides through the nearby 
Duckpond neighborhood. Horses trot-ted by families waiting in line, the kids 
shrieking in excitement.
Families ﬁ  led into galleries, taking in 
the festivities and the art the facility of-
fered.
Music from three entertainment 
groups danced about the building, softly ﬁ  lling the rooms with songs of the sea-son.
Sam Kragiel, 37, said he was happy his 
family could make it to the festival. His 6-month-old son, Julian, gazed starry-eyed at the sparkling tree that towered above him.
“We live nearby, and we’ve been 
meaning to come,” Kragiel said. “It’s a nice start to the holiday season.”
Event coordinator David Ballard said 
the location of the ceremony was perfect.
“The Thomas Center has such historic 
charm,” he said. “It’s the cultural center of our city.”City decks the halls at annual tree-lighting ceremony downtown

 �THE PROJECT WAS FOR THE 
DESIGN INNOVATION CLASS.
KATIE CAMPBELL
Alligator Contributing Writer
Two UF students reached out to the Boys 
& Girls Club of Alachua County to make a big 
difference in a small way.
Advertising sophomore Stephanie Ou and 
architecture sophomore Sara Schwartz, both 
19, teamed up in their Design Innovation class 
for the Make a Difference project. The project pushes students to use their interior design skills to provide helpful innovations to non-
profit organizations. The project is sponsored 
by the Interior Design Educators Council.
After abandoning their original idea be-
cause of budget restrictions — each pair of stu-
dents could spend up to $40 on its innovation 
— Ou said she and Schwartz decided to create 
a reading corner.
“It was a good thing, because if we had a 
higher budget, we would go crazy,” Ou said. 
“I feel like the budget gave us restrictions that 
we needed, and I think that helps us with dis-
cipline. Just because you have the money, you 
shouldn’t go over budget.”
They chose to work with the Boys & Girls 
Club after Ou visited the organization and 
learned how open to the project the staff was. 
Ou and Schwartz were allowed to do what-
ever they wanted to make the difference they envisioned for the customer.
Ou said the Boys & Girls Club invites speak-
ers and volunteers to read to the children who 
spend time there after school, but it did not 
have a suitable space for those occasions.Ou and Schwartz used a partition to section 
off the reading area in one of the classrooms, put up inspirational posters and set up two beanbag chairs and a large rug. They spent $34 on their innovation.
UF professor and Department of Interior 
Design chairwoman Margaret Portillo said 
students were instructed to go out into the 
community to find organizations in need to in-crease the scope of their innovations’ impacts.
The original innovations aren’t always used 
in the way they were intended, she said, but by 
reaching out to those in need, UF students had 
the opportunity to make a difference in ways that may otherwise have been overlooked.
For Ou, the project became more than 
something she was doing for a grade. It was 
a chance to communicate with a real customer 
and give back to the community while learn-ing something new about interior design and her own skills.
Schwartz and Ou went back after they fin-
ished the corner to see the impact it made.
“We were nervous to see how they were 
using it, but at the same time, the whole idea of the project was to see how they were using 
our innovation,” Schwartz said.
The Boys & Girls Club staff members and 
children gave the UF students positive feed-
back, she said. 
One boy admired the pictures of UF that 
lined the walls, and a girl complimented the beanbag chairs.
“It was great, even though it wasn’t like 
‘Extreme Home Makeover,’” Ou said. “Just 
making that small space, me and Sara were re-
ally proud, and we were really happy at the 
end.”Students design reading corner   Reader response

Today’s question: Will you go see Mark Cuban speak  
today?
32% YES
68% NOFriday’s question: Will you rent an iPad next semester?If you haven’t heard of John Mulaney, then I’m sorry, because 
you won’t care about the beginning of this column.
In his recent Comedy Central special, “New In Town,” he 
talks about how people mistook him for a woman thanks to his voice when he was a kid. He had a voice “like a little ﬂ  ute,” he 
said.
“I was once on the telephone with Blockbuster Video,” Mu-
laney said, “which is a very old-fashioned sentence.”
When was the last time you went into a physical building 
that housed a Blockbuster?
It seems like, thanks to the Internet, there is a much smaller 
need for physical copies of movies.
If a movie isn’t on Netﬂ  ix Instant or Hulu, then we are much 
less likely to hunt down a physical copy — unless it’s for a class and you have to search through the library . But even that feels 
like a scary hassle.
It feels weird to let an entire industry become obsolete be-
cause of convenience.
What’ll happen to libraries and bookstores once e-readers 
and tablets become overwhelmingly popular? To be fair, librar-ies will most likely be around for quite a while because they cost no money to use or join, which a lot of people really appreciate.
It seems like Netﬂ  ix is about to get more competition, and 
Blockbuster is about to get more dirt thrown on its grave.
Redbox Instant. The company has devised a way to stream 
video to mobile devices as well as offer low-cost DVD rentals for what appears to be less than Netﬂ  ix’s price. It could launch at some point later this month. 
Is this a good thing? Does Netﬂ  ix deserve competition in the 
streaming and video rental world? Probably. There should be as few monopolies as possible. The more monopolies we have, the less fair society becomes. However, there should be competition 
only when we need it.
How many video streaming or renting companies do we re-
quire?
Let’s take Blockbuster, for example. It is a relic of a more sim-
ple time, but it also became sad and absolutely useless. There 
was no way to modernize the company to keep up with the changing times. Children will grow up without knowing that entire stores were dedicated to renting videos.
Instead, now they’ll only know about tiny booths that dis-
pense movies or websites that stream classics onto their mobile devices and computers.
Are we losing the physical world bit by bit? Are we heading 
too fast into a less nostalgic world? Does it matter?
We like a lot of things because they are convenient. Take a 
look down the main street or highway in a town, and you’ll see the neon signs of America’s fast-food worship. Observe a line in Starbucks, and try to guess how irritated people are if they have to wait just a couple minutes to move through it.
We should slow down and appreciate the smaller things in 
life, even if it takes a moment.
But Lord knows, if our video takes too long to buffer and 
load, we will get upset real quick.Much Better 
Too much instant 
competition
It’s that time of year again!
Time for sugar cookies, gingerbread men, “Jingle Bell 
Rock,” Christmas trees — the whole shebang!
But most important, it’s time for people whining about 
our culture “taking the Christ out of Christmas” to irritate 
me out of my socks.
Before you say anything rash, let’s rewind a minute. There 
is, in fact, a long tradition of a festival in late December dur-
ing which people get together to give gifts and make merry — it’s called Saturnalia, and it’s just what it sounds like: a Roman festival to worship the god Saturn.
That’s just one of many winter celebrations that predates 
Christmas. Pope Benedict XVI (who I’d argue is a pretty au-thoritative source for Christian scholarship) cites as the di-
rect ancestor to Christmas an event called Dies Natalis Sol 
Invictus, a Dec. 25 feast that celebrated the birth of the ofﬁ  cial Roman sun god (Sol Invictus).
The birth of Jesus wasn’t celebrated as a holiday/feast 
day until about the fourth century CE. In fact, early Christian theologians like Origen and Arnobius disparaged birth festi-vals of ﬁ  gures like Herod and the pagan gods.
Christmas gained prominence during the Middle Ages 
because of political coincidences: Charlemagne and William 
the Conqueror were crowned on Christmas Day.
My point is that the only reason we can “take the Christ 
out of Christmas” is that we put him in there in the ﬁ  rst 
place. People stuck Jesus in festivals and customs that were already around so they could celebrate about that time of year without being called pagan and burned at the stake or something.
I’m sure Jesus doesn’t care that “Christmas” is abbrevi-
ated “Xmas” any more than he cares that sometimes I wear 
torn-up sandals and a T-shirt with a picture of a cookie on it 
to church.
Celebrating the spirit of holiday generosity is important 
whether you call the holidays “the holidays,” “X-Mas,” “Kwanzaa,” “Christmas,” “Hanukkah” or whatever amal-gamation of the above sarcastic a-holes are parading around these days. (For ease, I’m just going to call the whole holi-days/Christmahanakwanzwatevs season thing “Christmas” for the rest of this column.)
I suspect that’s what the mourn-
ing of a Christ-less Christmas is more about anyway, although the only people I’ve encountered who 
complained about it were more 
focused on the literal morphemic substitution mentioned above. 
Our problem is not that there’s 
not enough generosity on Christ-
mas. America is great at holiday cheer, helping the needy and all that jazz during the Christmas season, when Santa/our neighbors are watching.
It’s the other 11 months of the year when we suck.
Maybe we should take Christ out of Christmas — and put 
him into the rest of the year, when there are still needy peo-
ple, hungry people and people who need love and warmth.
Look, I’m not trying to be a Scrooge and “bah humbug” 
away your Christmas cheer with irrelevant historical facts and guilt tripping.
And I’m not trying to be one more of the millions of peo-
ple saying “All you Christians are too sensitive! Jesus was born in, like, May anyway . Plus, there are Saturnalia and Sol 
Invictus, so let’s rename Christmas ‘Santamas’ or whatever. 
Yay atheism.”
I like Christmas. I like Santa, and I like nativity scenes.Rather than spending our time engaging in meaningless 
linguistic and historical debates that get nobody anywhere, can’t we imitate Jesus and Santa, and give some gifts of love this holiday season? Can’t we do the same thing in January , February, March and the rest of the eight crazy months?
Because if not, we’re no better than the Romans who gave 
their slaves a week of freedom during the “December liber-ty” of Saturnalia, then spent the rest of the year beating them and generally treating them mercilessly.
If we’re no better than the Romans, then we better learn 
Latin. And I know how much everybody hates learning Lat-in.

S itting on a bed, Danielle 
Ruiz watched Luis Pereira and 
his roommate in the kitchen. They stood with their backs to Ruiz and ﬁ  lled a milk jug with alcohol and 
another mysterious substance.
“Crystal Light,” Pereira said.
Ruiz met with Pereira earlier that 
night in October 2010 outside Spank, a Southwest Second Street club, af-ter she left a costume party. Pereira invited Ruiz — and others, he said — to his place. Ruiz always enjoyed his parties, so she went, still wear-
ing a black sequin jacket and a pink 
tutu. When she arrived, though, the apartment was empty.
Ruiz felt uncomfortable, so they 
went to another party . When they returned to his place, she planned 
to call a friend to pick her up and 
gently told Pereira she didn’t want to stay.
“How about a game of cards?” 
Ruiz remembers him asking.
“Sure,” she said.They’d played cards before. One 
game wouldn’t hurt. She had no idea that the next morning she would 
wake up in Pereira’s bed, and for the 
next two years, she would recount her last memories of the card game to law enforcement and lawyers in a sexual battery case.
That night, Ruiz would testify , 
Pereira handed her the light pink drink in a clear cup. Ruiz studied it, then sipped.
The liquid ran down her throat.No, she said. It’s too strong.Pereira retreated to the kitchen.As a recent transplant from Baton 
Rouge, La., looking for a fresh start, Ruiz met Pereira in the summer of 2009. She planned to see a couple of her new friends downtown. There, Pereira introduced himself. He 
played the part of the affable club 
promoter, as he always did.
He asked for her phone number, 
and for the next year he texted Ruiz to promote different events. Some-times she went.
Back in his bedroom, Pereira 
handed Ruiz the drink again. This time it tasted better. Pereira and his roommate sat on the bed with her and played cards. Ruiz can’t remember what game they played. 
She just remembers winning and the 
guys teasing her, feigning anger. She thought they were drinking the pink liquid, too.
As she played, Ruiz felt the same 
way she did 12 years earlier at band camp the summer before her sopho-more year at Central High School, where she marched with her piccolo in the heat of a Louisiana summer. 
Her team practiced the “Batman” 
theme song, and when she emerged out of a sunburst formation, she felt light-headed, and her vision fal-tered.
As she sat on Pereira’s bed, the 
feeling returned.
“You can see,” says Ruiz, now 29, 
“and it slowly goes black.”

Experts say rapists are elusive, 
slipping through a porous system that can’t account for crimes that of-ten leave behind little physical evi-dence. Each case, of course, has two sides. On one end are the words of 
the victims and the law enforcement 
ofﬁ  cials who chase any lead they can ﬁ  nd. On the other end are the words of the perpetrators and the lawyers who defend them.
In Gainesville, 82 women report-
ed rape in 2011, according to the FBI Uniform Crime Report. That repre-sents a rate more than twice as high 
as the national average.
But the statistics tell only a frac-
tion of the story. Instead of reporting 
the crime, many victims keep the act where it started: in the bedroom.
Some women think male police 
ofﬁ  cers won’t believe them, will call them worse things than promiscu-ous and send them on their way . 
Other victims blame themselves and 
think they deserved to get raped. Still more women just don’t want to talk about what happened, espe-cially with detectives, lawyers and judges.
Nicole Drummond, a fam-
ily, youth and community sciences graduate student, didn’t tell police that a man raped her as a 20-year-old sophomore in December 2007. The offender was her friend, and she didn’t want to see him in trou-ble. Another UF student, then 21 years old, told Gainesville Police in 
August 2011 that she didn’t want 
to press charges because she would rather pretend it didn’t happen.
Getting victims in Gainesville, or 
anywhere else, to report is particu-larly difﬁ  cult when those victims re-alize how few offenders actually get prosecuted. The Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network estimates 
that 20 percent of rapists reported 
to cops get prosecuted and 7 percent spend a day in prison.
Since 2009, 24 of the 107 sexual 
battery cases that police sent to the Alachua County State Attorney’s Ofﬁ  ce are still open. Of the remain-ing 83, the court convicted 13 defen-dants and dropped 46 cases — some 
because the victim didn’t partici-
pate, some because the prosecutor determined that the police failed to collect signiﬁ  cant evidence.
In another 19 cases, the defen-
dants were found guilty on different charges, some of them taking plea deals to avoid sexual battery trials.
State Attorney’s Ofﬁ  ce spokes-
man Spencer Mann says the prose-cution rate is low because rape cases are difﬁ  cult to prove. Victims con-tradict themselves in testimonies, and sometimes they consume illegal drugs before the rape, damaging 
their credibility to a jury . And even if 
those issues don’t arise, how do you show, beyond a doubt, that sex was not consensual?
In September 2008 — more than 
two years before Ruiz would stay the night at Pereira’s apartment — two UF students accused Pereira of rape. The case ended without a trial. 
Instead, Pereira pled no contest to 
three counts of aggravated assault. He received one year of probation and a 60-day jail sentence, to be served Sundays through Tuesdays.
As part of the deal, Pereira was 
free for the rest of the week so he could keep his job as a club promot-er. That’s how he met Ruiz.
“How can you look at this and 
let him walk?” Ruiz said when she learned of the case. “How do you believe in the system if it doesn’t work?”
  
When she awoke, Ruiz didn’t 
know where she was, or how she fell asleep on that particular bed in Pereira’s apartment at Jefferson 2nd Avenue, now 2nd Avenue Centre. It was sometime between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m., but it felt like evening. Some-one closed the blinds tightly . She couldn’t remember the night before — why her body ached and why she 
lay next to Pereira.
Ruiz staggered into the bath-
room, where she felt a sticky sub-
stance against her hand, like glue. She washed it off and noticed her underwear was twisted. Someone yanked the front part to the side. A Calvin Klein emblem was supposed to be on one hip, but it was upside down on the other hip. That couldn’t happen, she thought, unless some-one ﬁ  rst pulled them off.
She nudged Pereira until he 
woke up.
“What happened?” Ruiz asked.“What do you mean?” Pereira re-
sponded, according to Ruiz.
“What happened?”“Nothing,” he said. “I don’t 
know. I have a headache.”
Ruiz asked again, panicked now. 
Pereira said she tugged the 
shower curtain off and threw up in 
the bathroom. Ruiz didn’t believe him. She cried.
In the ensuing weeks, Ruiz said 
she almost never left her apartment. She hurried each day to the mailbox. What if he was in the complex? Her toy-sized poodle, Star, yapped every 
time someone strolled by the win-
dow, and Ruiz peeked outside look-ing for him. Even when she groomed dogs at PetSmart, she couldn’t focus. She feared Pereira would come in and accost her, and her co-workers would ask questions.
So she moved back to Baton 
Rouge, where Sunday afternoons 
with gumbo, jambalaya and biscuits 
seemed so inviting. She told her family she returned to care for her grandfather, Henry , whose wife had just died.
But her family members knew 
something troubled Ruiz. She was too quiet and private, and she didn’t seem interested in dating. Finally , 
she told her mother. She asked her 
stepmother to break the news to her dad.
“It’s hard for me to tell him, to 
talk to him about anything like that because — ” Ruiz exhaled, crying as her voice cracked. “I see how much it hurts him to know that something like that happened, and he couldn’t 
do anything.”

Most rapes don’t occur as they 
often do on TV and in the movies. 
The rapist isn’t some mysterious man who pulls a woman into the woods and holds her down while 
she screams. In two out of three 
rapes, according to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, the victim and offender knew each oth-er. And 60 percent of rapes happen in a home, whether it’s the victim’s, the rapist’s or a mutual friend’s. So, unlike in other crimes, police ofﬁ  cers don’t have a common problem area 
they can patrol or a list of informants 
who can tip them off ahead of time.

can do,” GPD Sgt. John Nabet says.
Captain Lynne Benck, the head of GPD in-
vestigations, has worked at Gainesville Police 
for 24 years. She wants the rape rate to de-crease, but she doesn’t know how. Maybe if fa-mous men spoke out against the crime, she has thought.
“If there was anything we could do, believe 
me, I would have the chief and the major riled up,” she says. “We’d have 40 to 50 people go-ing after this problem right now. But it’s not that kind of crime. It’s not going to happen. I don’t know what we’d do with 40 or 50 people.”

Joseph Mayo sat at his desk at the police de-
partment two years ago when another detective asked for his help. See, there’s this case, Chuck Dale said. You know the defendant and seem to have a rapport with him. His name is Luis 
Pereira and —
“Son of a bitch,” Mayo said. “He did it 
again.”
Mayo met Pereira on a Saturday morning in 
September 2008, about two hours before sunrise. 
Another officer called Mayo out to the parking lot of Arlington Square Apartments, downtown on Southeast Second Place. Mayo just happened to be the detective on call that night.
About half an hour earlier, a UF student 
woke up in bed with two people — a woman to her left, Pereira to her right. 
Susan *, at first, did not know where she was. 
The room was dark, she said, but a little light shined inside. Perhaps it glowed off a computer monitor or seeped from the hallway through a crack in the door. Either way , she said, she saw 
what happened.
Sitting up, Pereira dipped his hand under 
the tan and maroon bedspread and reached 
between her legs. Still drowsy, Susan didn’t un-derstand for a couple of seconds. Then, Pereira slid his hand down again, forcing his fingers in-
side her once more.
She jumped out of bed.
The bottom of her yellow dress was flipped 
above her waist, and someone had tugged the front of her underwear to the side.
Calm down, Pereira urged her.But she wouldn’t. She shook the other 
woman in bed, her friend and classmate. No re-sponse. Susan shook her again, more violently this time. Again, no response. She grabbed a phone and ran outside, still barefoot.
She scampered around in the dark, crying 
and calling every number she could think of. She didn’t know where she was. She didn’t re-member going to Arlington Square that night. She kept dialing numbers, kept hearing the 
polite voicemail messages of sleeping friends. 
Finally, she connected with an ex-boyfriend. He called his father, who called the police.
As officers arrived at the parking lot, the oth-
er woman ran outside. She finally stirred awake, she told police, as Pereira had sex with her.
Both women left the parking lot before Mayo arrived. They waited at the Alachua Gen-
eral Hospital for nurses to collect evidence from 
them. But first, from a police car, Susan pointed to Pereira.
It was him, she told officers.Positive.
Mayo brought Pereira and six other men to 
GPD headquarters for questioning. Pereira de-
nied having sex with either woman. He said he returned home from a club about 3 a.m. and saw Susan sleeping in his bed — drunk, he said. Next thing he knew, he woke up as Susan 
jumped out of bed and ran away.
During the interview, another officer called 
Mayo. The women weren’t pressing charges. 
Case closed.
Fine, Mayo said. But first, he drove to the 
hospital. He wanted to meet the victims.
  
Born and raised in North Florida, Susan said 
she came to UF ignorant of drinking, drugs and sex. When she went out, she volunteered as the group’s designated driver and victim of friendly ridicule. “Goodie goodie,” her friends called her.
Susan is only 4 feet, 11 inches tall. She is tan 
with long, silky black hair that runs down her upper back, passing a thin nose and chocolate brown eyes along the way.
That fall, Susan started hanging out with a 
woman from her psychology classes, and she invited Susan to a Main Street bar called Gothic Grill (now Rockeys Dueling Piano Bar). They could get in for free, the woman said. Her friend was a promoter there.
Susan felt uncomfortable. Pereira stood a 
foot taller and nine years her senior. But he of-fered a drink, and she took it. She didn’t want to seem boring.
“And that,” she said four years later, “is all 
I remember.”
Susan doesn’t know if someone drugged her 
or if she couldn’t handle alcohol. She weighed less than 100 pounds and rarely drank. And even if she was drugged, finding out is difficult. Some popular date-rape drugs, experts say , leave your system within about four hours — 
quick enough to go undetected in drug tests.
Regardless, court testimony and public re-
cords give the following account of the rest of 
that night:
Susan drank more at the bar before walking 
with the rest of the group to Arlington Square. There, the group drank and ordered pizza, but Susan got sick.
The other woman asked Pereira if she and 
Susan could stay the night before she carried Susan to Pereira’s bed. Later, the woman joined 
Susan. She had slept over before without a prob-
lem. She thought just the two of them would 
share the bed. She thought Pereira would sleep on the floor.
“When I woke up,” the woman testified in 
a court hearing this February, “he was having sex with me.”
Later that morning, Susan and her friend 
waited in a hospital room, each alone. They couldn’t visit each other because it would hurt 
the police’s case. They got together at the hospi-
tal, a defense attorney might argue, because they were cooking up a lie to nab Pereira. So Susan waited hours, she said she thinks, for a nurse to come in and collect evidence, to snap pictures and take swabs and check for DNA on Susan. It was as if she were a human crime scene.
Susan grew impatient, scared and tired. And 
she felt dirty . She wanted to take a shower. She 
sneaked out of her hospital room and crept to 
her friend’s. From the moment she met police that morning, the other woman didn’t want to press charges, and she didn’t want a nurse to see her. She told Susan she knew a rape victim who reported the crime and watched humili-ated as the man walked away free, as if nothing happened.This is a waste of time, the woman said. Let’s 
get out of here.
Later that day, Susan regretted her decision. 
Her brother found out what happened through a mutual friend, one of the people Susan called 
in her 5 a.m. panic. Her brother couldn’t believe 
Susan wasn’t pressing charges. How can you let someone get away with that?
Susan said she went back to the hospital. She 
said she met her victim advocate and a police officer there. She told them she wanted nurses to collect evidence, but she said the nurses in-formed her it was too late, that you can’t col-lect evidence once a victim leaves the hospital. 
Leaving the hospital meant contaminating the 
crime scene: her body.
She still wanted to press charges. She said 
the other officer at the hospital vowed to relay the message to Detective Mayo.
Mayo disputes this time frame. He says Su-
san called him two weeks later, unable to sleep and looking for justice. Gainesville Police holds a two-day policy: If a rape victim visits a hospi-
tal within 48 hours of the incident, nurses can 
collect evidence. So, he says, Susan didn’t call him the day of the rape. She couldn’t have.
“You really only have one opportunity to get 
evidence,” Mayo says. “And that was it: that one night.”
The detective picked up the case. But he 
didn’t like his odds. At that time, the other woman didn’t want to press charges. Mayo had 
no evidence and no witnesses. For the most part, 
the case was dead unless Pereira confessed.
And rapists don’t confess.
  
Mayo spread pictures of Susan and the other 
woman across a table. He looked at them. Then, he looked up, his eyes meeting Pereira’s in a 
GPD interrogation room.
It was January 2009, about four months after 
the incident. Mayo still had no evidence besides 
Susan’s word, and he didn’t think the case was going anywhere. Without a confession from Pereira, Mayo would probably write a sworn complaint, and it would go to the State Attor -
ney’s Office, and it would end there, probably . And Mayo didn’t expect a confession. Why 
would he? He had no leverage. He looked at 
the pictures again.
“These girls are beautiful,” he said. “Aren’t 
they?”
Pereira didn’t respond.Mayo says he didn’t try to intimidate Pereira. 
That isn’t his style. He prides himself on build-ing a rapport with everyone — co-workers, victims, defendants, whoever. One time, Mayo 
says, a man confessed to sexually abusing his 
own teenage daughters. Then, he thanked the detective for helping lift the burden off his chest.
Mayo has worked at Gainesville Police for 27 years, and he wears a quick smile below his short, silver hair. Curse words are some of his favorite adjectives, nouns and verbs, and he punctuates his sentences with laughter or the word “man.”
For Gainesville’s darkest sinners, he is their 
foul-mouthed priest, assigning handcuffs in-stead of Hail Marys for forgiveness.
“I have an innate ability to talk and listen to 
people, all sorts of people, regardless of their social or economic standing,” Mayo wrote in a 1992 letter requesting a transfer from the patrol unit to the GPD investigations division.
Mayo didn’t always want to be a police of-
ficer. Growing up as a Cuban immigrant in southwest Miami, he hated cops. When he was a kid, officers stopped by while he played foot-ball on the street. They yelled at Mayo and his friends and threatened to beat them up if the boys talked back. Then the Miami-Dade officers drove away, Mayo’s football in their hands.
He enrolled at UF, but soon needed a job. He 
signed up to take aptitude tests for the police 
force and the fire department. The GPD test 
came first. Mayo scored in the top 3 percent, and he was offered a job. He took it, figuring he would stay a year, save his money and get back to school.
“I ended up liking it,” he says. “The danger, 
the adrenaline — it was fun. It reminded me of when I was a kid.”
Twenty-four years later, Mayo tapped into 
his roots. He tried to be Pereira’s friend, tried to pull him in like a fisherman. He spoke with Pereira, a Puerto Rican native, in English and Spanish.
And he lied. He said the State Attorney’s Of-
fice was looking at the case. In truth, prosecu-tors didn’t know about it yet. There had been no arrest. Mayo also told Pereira seven times that nurses found his hand DNA on the women. 
Hand DNA does not exist.
“These girls are beautiful, aren’t they?” 
Mayo said again.
Finally, Pereira responded, “Yeah.”
“You know, they’re not just beautiful. They’re 
gorgeous.”
“Yeah,” Pereira said again. “You’re right.”“There’s no guy in the world that would 
resist putting his hands on these girls,” Mayo 
said.
Pereira sat silent. Mayo said it again, twice 
more. Pereira obliged.
“Yeah, you’re right,” Pereira said. “Nobody 
could resist it.”
“Come on, man,” Mayo said. “I know you 
put your hands on her.”
Pereira, once more, fell silent. And once 
more, Mayo tried to catch him. You know, he said, investigators can find hand DNA on a vic-
tim weeks later. There’s no way Pereira’s DNA would show up, was there?
That’s when Pereira confessed, Mayo recalls. 
Pereira said he grabbed Susan’s breasts, slid his hands down her passed-out body and reached inside her underwear. Mayo asked about the other woman. Pereira didn’t hesitate.
“I had sex with her,” he said.Mayo stopped, speechless. He didn’t expect 
a confession to come so easily. But it wasn’t a confession, at least not the type Mayo wanted. He asked Pereira if the woman was passed out like Susan. No, Pereira said, the sex was consen-sual.
Still, Mayo was satisfied with the interroga-
tion. The other woman agreed to press charges with Susan, and Mayo arrested Pereira on four counts of sexual battery.
The case went to the State Attorney’s Office, 
and it fell apart, as sexual battery cases often do. Prosecutor Bill Ezzell faced the burden of prov-ing a he-said, she-said case, as prosecutors of-ten do in rape trials. It didn’t matter that it was two women’s words against one man’s. They still lacked evidence. And Pereira’s defense at-torney, Nick Zissimopulos, poked holes in the GPD investigation.
Susan said she felt groggy when she woke 
up, Zissimopulos argued in a deposition with Mayo. How dependable was her memory of those early morning moments? And even if someone did grope Susan, as she said, who’s to say Pereira was the offender? He and his friends said the other woman in bed that night was bi-sexual. What if she abused Susan? And sure, Pereira told Mayo he touched Susan. But did 
he really have any other choice? Mayo lied to 
Pereira, told him investigators found his hand DNA on Susan. What if Pereira confessed be-cause he knew that was what Mayo wanted? What if Pereira was just scared of Mayo, a police officer? Pereira is a minority living in the United States, after all.
Susan moved out of town in the summer of 
2009 to get away from Pereira and the trial. She 
couldn’t leave her home in Gainesville. She felt 
nervous that she would run into Pereira. Scared. Sick to her stomach. She saw him once at a bar downtown, she says. He walked up to her, smil-ing. Her whole body shook.
As she received updates about the case, her 
hopes of going to trial faded. A victim advocate told her about a plea deal: 60 days in jail, one year of probation. Susan asked if he could be 
labeled a sex offender as part of the deal. He 
wasn’t.
“If that doesn’t say , ‘I’m a joke,’ I don’t know 
what does,” she says. “It was a total slap in the face.”
Months earlier, when Susan first pressed 
charges, Mayo told her the case wouldn’t have legs without a Pereira confession. But, if he could somehow get Pereira to admit to having 
sex . . .
“Well, the case goes through the system,” 
Mayo says, “and they cut him a sweet deal. … I 
felt bad. Really bad.”
 
 
Pereira makes his money promoting bars 
and clubs in town. V enues like The Swamp Restaurant, Fat Daddy’s and Envy serve as the 
background to pictures of him online. Beauti-
ful college women in dresses serve as the fore-ground.
“Look at his job setup,” Mayo says. “He’s a 
club promoter, man. He’s in the bars. He’s giv-ing these girls free drinks. He lets them in the bars free and everything. That’s his environ-ment, his honey.”
While Susan’s trial played out, Mayo says 
he met two other women who accused Pereira of rape. They were at Fat Tuesday after hours, the women told Mayo. But they didn’t want to press charges. They deserved it, they said.
Around town, Pereira, 34, goes by “Luijo.” 
On his Facebook page, he advertises ticket sales to local events like “Dance of the Dead II” at the Vault NightClub.
After talking with his second defense at-
torney , Huntley Johnson, Pereira declined to comment for this story. But in a Facebook mes-sage, he sent the Alligator a New York Times ar -
ticle about the unofficial practice of prosecutors threatening defendants with harsh sentences if they do not agree to a plea deal. The article fo-cuses on Alachua County.
Even if a defendant thinks he is innocent, the 
article argues, he or she will likely take a plea deal out of fear. But because these conversations supposedly unfold behind closed doors, there are no official records to prove how often they happen.
Pereira asked a reporter if he had read the 
Times’ article before. The reporter told him he had not.
“That’s funny,” Pereira wrote, “considering 
the article is using Gainesville as an example.”
  
As she walked out of the courthouse this Oc-
tober, two years after she said Pereira raped her, Ruiz’s brown hair cascaded down her pale face to her shoulders.
She doesn’t wear a set hairstyle, never has. 
The oldest of seven sisters, Ruiz grew up pluck-ing, pulling and pinning back her naturally 
curly strands in whichever form or fashion ap-
pealed to her that day. But two years ago, that changed.
For months after she woke up next to Perei-
ra, she says she would only twist her hair into a ponytail. She chose outfits that hid her legs. She stopped wearing makeup.
“I was afraid that if I looked nice it would 
happen to me,” she says. “Somebody would be 
attracted to me, and it would happen again.”
Ruiz wants to put the case behind her. She 
has made her peace with it, time healing her 
wounds as much as they can be healed. She doesn’t blame herself like she used to, like Su-san did, too. She doesn’t feel tainted anymore either, as so many victims in Gainesville and elsewhere feel after their identities have become just a number on the ever stretching list of vic-
tims.
Ruiz wears her hair down again, and she 
finally feels comfortable dating. She started a 
long-distance relationship with the brother of one of her best friends, communicating almost entirely on the phone for about a year.
In April, she moved to Wesley Chapel to live 
with him. In September they got married on the beach.All the while, the case sat in the back of her 
mind. She prepared to go to trial, to take the stand and swear on the Bible and tell a jury what 
Pereira did to her and then sit back and listen to 
Susan and Susan’s friend give their testimonies. Like the first case, this one didn’t involve much physical evidence because Ruiz didn’t tell po-lice until more than a week after the incident — too late for nurses to examine her. But a crime lab analyst from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement found Pereira’s DNA on Ruiz’s shorts. And three women were accusing Pereira 
this time. Maybe this case would be different.
But maybe not.
Zissimopulos questioned Ruiz’s story , just 
like he did with Susan and her friend in the first case. The day after Pereira allegedly raped Ruiz, he ordered food for her, and she ate it. And they still texted each other afterward. In one message, Zissimopulos pointed out at a pretrial hearing in February, Ruiz ended with a 
smiley face. Why would a rape victim do that? 
And Pereira’s friends claimed Ruiz sometimes did drugs around them. Who’s to say she didn’t drug herself that night?
Determining Pereira’s potential punishment 
is complicated. Because Ruiz said he raped her while still on probation for the previous case, however, Pereira could have faced a minimum prison sentence of 25 years if he were convicted 
of sexual battery this time.
But Ezzell, who also prosecuted Pereira after 
his first arrest, again offered a deal, and Pereira 
pled no contest to aggravated battery.
“It was a weak case,” says Mann, the State 
Attorney’s Office spokesman. “However, we felt that due to his previous criminal history, it was important to go forward and get sanc-tions.”
This time, the plea deal was a bit harsher. 
Pereira received 15 years of probation, which he can serve in Puerto Rico with his probation officer’s permission. He can’t break any laws, drink alcohol or use drugs. He must complete 100 hours of community service within two years and meet 20 times with a therapist who specializes in sexual treatment. He can’t work as a promoter. He can’t stay out past 11 p.m.
But he did not receive any jail time.Ruiz wanted to see a harsher punishment, as 
most victims do. She wanted to tell a jury how painful her life was for the last two years. She wanted to point out that the man she said raped her didn’t even put her name in his cellphone. At one hearing, Ruiz says, she saw a screenshot of a message she sent Pereira. At the top of the image, it said the message came from “Blue 
Eyes.” Her eyes are green.
Looking back, she wishes she were more 
educated about rape two years ago. She wishes 
she went to the hospital so that nurses could have taken evidence. And she wishes she knew that the county offers victim advocates who will listen to your struggles and tell you that fear and pain are understandable, that you aren’t going crazy.
Susan and Ruiz have looked at each other’s 
cases and felt spooked. The crimes seem too similar, both agree. What if they were planned?
“Three girls have reported, and he’s still get-
ting away with it,” Susan says. “What does he have to do? Kill one of us?”
At least the cases are over, Ruiz figures. 
Maybe she can move on now. Maybe she won’t think about it as much. She isn’t holding her 
breath.
When she thinks about Pereira, nerves dance 
in her stomach and twist her insides into knots. 
She can’t eat. Can’t sleep. The day before the hearing in October, she could only groom three dogs — half her normal pace. She couldn’t steady her hands.
“I don’t know if it will ever go away,” she 
says of the pain.
Ruiz has looked for outlets. Maybe poetry 
will help, she thought. So she tried it:
Why does a wretch of a man run free to lurk the 
shadows?
I feel he should be punishd,But who will do so?If the law is also wretched, then who to turn to 
for justice?Law enforcement unsure how to curb rape rates

Shawn Janetzke and Tyler Jett / Alligator StaffRape PreventionTips
Police, prosecutors and victim advo -
cates maintain that rape victims are not 
to blame for the crime. You can never completely protect yourself from sexual assault. But the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network suggests you take some precautions while in social settings:
Go with a group of friends. Arrive 
together, check in with each other throughout the evening and leave together.1.
Trust your instincts. If you feel unsafe in a situation, go with your gut. If you see something suspicious, contact 
law enforcement immediately.2.
Don’t leave your drink unattended. If 
you’ve left your drink alone, just get a new one.3.
Watch out for your friends, and vice versa. If a friend seems out of it, is too intoxicated for the amount of alcohol they’ve had, or is acting out of character, get him or her to a safe place immediately.
4.
Shawn Janetzke and Tyler Jett / Alligator StaffIf you suspect you or a friend has been drugged, contact law enforce-ment immediately. Be explicit with doctors so they can give you the cor -
rect tests (you will need a urine test and possibly others).5.

PLAYED IN NEW ORLEANS 
ON JAN. 2 AT 8:30 P.M.

Florida’s berth in the Sugar 
Bowl was a foregone conclu-
sion, but its opponent was a mystery. 
On Sunday night, UF was 
officially selected to square off against Louisville on Jan. 2 at 8:30 p.m. in the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans. 
“We’re honored to play 
in New Orleans,” coach Will Muschamp said. “Our guys are really jacked up. … Our guys were thrilled to have this op-
portunity , so they’ll be excited 
about this game.”
Oklahoma was projected to 
face Florida, but Northern Illi-nois stole Oklahoma’s BCS bid by defeating Kent State 44-37 in the Mid-American Conference Championship Game. The win vaulted the Huskies to No. 15 in 
the BCS standings. By rule, any 
team from a non-BCS confer -
ence that finishes in the top 16 
of the BCS standings and ranks 
ahead of a champion from one of the big six conferences earns an automatic BCS bowl berth.
Oklahoma finished the sea-
son 10-2, but 11-1 Kansas State was selected to represent the Big 12 in the Fiesta Bowl. 
Louisville — the Big East 
champion — is ranked No. 21 in the latest BCS standings.  Florida checked in at No. 3, 
moving up one spot after No. 2 Alabama defeated previous No. 3 Georgia 32-28 in the South-eastern Conference Champion-
ship Game. 
After tabbing Florida, the 
Sugar Bowl was the second-
to-last BCS bowl to select its second participant. The Sugar Bowl chose Louisville over Northern Illinois, which will face Florida State in the Orange Bowl on Jan. 1. 
Charlie Strong, who served 
as the Gators’ defensive coor -
dinator from 2002-09, coaches the Cardinals. Muschamp met Strong during his time as the defensive coordinator at LSU.
“I’ve got a lot of respect for 
him and a guy that, in this pro-fession, is one of the good guys,” 
Muschamp said. “He was an 
outstanding defensive coordi-nator and a good friend.”
Louisville clinched the Big 
East championship and secured an automatic BCS bowl berth 
by erasing a 14-3 halftime defi-
cit to notch a 20-17 win against Rutgers on Thursday. The Car -
dinals are 10-2. Louisville won its first nine games before los-ing back-to-back games to Syr -
acuse and Connecticut, which are a combined 12-12. UF opens as a 16.5-point favorite. 
“This is a team that was one 
game away from playing for a national title,” Strong said of Florida. “We’re nowhere near that right now.”

When Florida lined up against Marquette 
on Thursday night, the Gators needed some-
one to step up and provide a quick boost. 
Michael Frazier II did just that   — and 
more. 
The freshman guard notched a team-high 
17 points and buried 5 of 8 three-point at-
tempts, helping the No. 7 Gators pull away in the first half during an 82-49 victory against the Golden Eagles. 
Four of Frazier’s threes came in the first 
half. In 22 minutes off the bench, he was 6-of-9 shooting. He also tallied two rebounds and an assist. 
“What can I say? It was unbelievable out there,” Frazier said. “My teammates did a great job of getting me the ball, and shots went down. … The bucket did seem bigger than usual.”
Most of Frazier’s points came in bunches. 
His first two three-pointers came on back-to-back possessions and increased the Gators’ 
lead to 16-9 with 11:39 remaining in the first half. With Florida up 
by 10 late in the first period, Frazier again hit 
three-pointers on consecutive possessions to 
stretch UF’s edge to 38-22. 
Frazier sunk his first four threes from the 
wing, and he scored his fifth from the left cor -
ner. All five of the 6-foot-4 guard’s three-point Freshman shining offensively

For the eighth year in a row, the Gators 
are among the final 16 teams alive in the 
NCAA Tournament.
No. 14 Florida (27-4) knocked off Col-
lege of Charleston (27-8) in three sets (25-20, 25-16, 25-14) on Saturday night in the O’Connell Center.
UF travels to Austin, Texas, for a re-
match against Texas on Dec. 7 at 8 p.m.
The Longhorns, the NCAA Tourna-
ment’s No. 3 overall seed, defeated the Gators in three sets (29-27, 25-22, 26-24) on Aug. 31 as part of the Nike Big Four Classic at Penn State.
On Saturday, Florida survived a close 
first set before separating itself from the start of the second set. UF never surren-dered the lead.As Florida’s offensive numbers in-
creased, College of Charleston’s hitting percentage declined. Gators coach Mary Wise credited the defensive effort mostly to middle blockers Betsy Smith and Chloe 
Mann.
“We rely so much 
on those middles on the court,” Wise said. “They’re like coaches on the floor. There are a lot of adjustments that are made and not made between serves, 
but while the ball is in 
play. And those two have developed such 
a high volleyball IQ.”
While Smith and Mann combined for 
eight blocks, they also contributed of-fensively with 18 kills and a .500 hitting Gators advance to Sweet 16

� THE UF WOMEN’S SQUAD 
NOTCHED ITS SECOND MEET 
VICTORY THIS SEASON.
STAFF REPORT
On Sunday, the Florida men’s 
swimming and diving team fin-
ished without a victory for the 
first time this season. 
The Gators finished second in 
a field of seven at the Ohio State 
Invitational in Columbus. 
 Ohio State held onto first place throughout the three-day meet, beating Florida by 309 points. 
Junior Bradley deBorde took 
second place in the 100-yard free-style on Sunday, one of his few 
bright spots at the invitational.
Sophomores Eduardo So-
laeche-Gomez and Matt Elliott 
shined in the 200 breaststroke, 
finishing first and second, respec-
tively, on Sunday. 
Junior Marcin Cieslak and se-
nior Sebastien Rousseau grabbed the top two spots in the 200 but-
terfly on Sunday.Those performances were  
the extent of the Gators men’s 
success, as the Buckeyes’ effort proved too much for Florida to overcome during the weekend.
Ohio State won 10 of 18 races 
dur -
ing the three-
d a y 
stretch en route to its fourth con-
secutive invitational title.
The Gators women’s team 
notched its second meet victory 
this season, holding  off second-place Stanford and third-place 
Ohio State.
Junior Elizabeth Beisel se-
cured first place in both the 200 backstroke and the 400 IM on Sat-
urday.
Junior Ellese Zalewski helped 
the Gators secure a first-place 
finish in the 200 medley relay on 
Saturday. 
Zalewski also posted a time of 
52.26 to notch a victory in the 100 
butterfly finals on Saturday.
 Her win was the third in-
dividual victory for the Gators women.
Zalewski also earned a sec-
ond-place finish in the 800 free relay on Saturday.
Florida will train until the fi-
nal week of December before tak-ing a short break. 
The UF men’s team will be off 
until Jan. 18, when it travels to 
Dallas for the SMU Classic, which 
will last two days.
Following the SMU Classic, 
the men will join the women back in the O’Connell Center for a du-
al-meet against FAU on Jan. 19.UF men’s team suffers first setback at Ohio State Invitational
UF Swimmingfield goals were catch-and-shoot attempts.   
“He was shooting a lot but hadn’t made 
a lot of shots lately, so I think [Thursday 
night] was good for him, for his confi-dence,” junior forward Will Yeguete said. 
Frazier showcased his knack for scoring 
in Florida’s exhibition against Nebraska-Kearney on Nov . 1. He recorded 21 points on 8-of-10 shooting and made 5 of 6 three-pointers.  
But prior to Thursday night’s contest, 
Frazier averaged 3.4 points per game on 25 percent shooting in five regular-season contests.  
“Michael’s shooting percentages [didn’t] 
indicate or reflect the kind of shooter he is for our team,” coach Billy Donovan said. “He’s proven in practice, he’s proven his whole career that he’s a really good shooter.” 
This season, Frazier has averaged 16.8 
minutes per game — the most of any Flori-da freshman. 
“It’s the next level, playing with other 
guys that are better than you” Frazier said. “My teammates trust me, so that feels good.”
Frazier’s ability to rebound well at small 
forward has earned him extended minutes. In six games, the natural shooting guard has averaged 2.8 boards per contest. 
Donovan said Frazier needs to better un-
derstand defensive schemes and rotations, 
but the freshman’s basketball IQ and work 
ethic in practice are unquestioned.  
“He’s one of those guys I really enjoy 
being around,” Donovan said. “He’s pas-sionate about the game, passionate about getting better and puts the time in.”MONDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2012 � ALLIGATOR, 15

Before the Gators begin winning 
games consistently, they must learn 
to finish. 
Florida (5-3) was just 7-10 in 
games decided by 10 points or fewer in 2011-12. On Saturday, the Gators 
dropped another close contest. 
Despite taking a 32-27 lead into 
halftime, Florida lost 59-53 to Michi-
gan. The Gators struggled to close out possessions and, ultimately , the game. 
“(Michigan likes) a low-posses-
sion ball game, and we didn’t do a good job defensively of maintaining 
our focus,” coach Amanda Butler 
said. “We would put a lot of pres-sure on them, and then we would have a breakdown with 10 seconds left (on the shot clock).”
Michigan’s methodical offense 
was troublesome. Florida botched assignments deep into possessions. 
Trailing in the second half, UF could 
not overcome the continual lapses.“Those last 10 
seconds (of pos-
sessions), your defense needs to 
get tighter and 
sharper,” Butler said. 
A s s i s t a n t 
coach David 
Lowery added: “You’ve got to have great defensive rotation, communi-cation, the whole nine because the 
way [Michigan] plays — constant 
movement, looking to spot up, look-ing to create opportunities for each 
other — I thought that was the dif-ference in the game.” 
Lowery said the coaching staff 
stressed the importance of staying focused against the Wolverines’ de-liberate offense. Evidently , that did not take hold. Michigan made 10 of 21 shots in the second half to reverse 
the halftime deficit. 
Florida faded down the stretch. 
The Gators hit 8 of 37 shots in the fi-nal 20 minutes and scored a season-
low 53 points. Jennifer George scored a team-
best 15 points and grabbed nine 
rebounds but was frustrated with Florida’s miscues. George said the 
Gators will continue to struggle if 
they don’t develop a focus that they lacked on Saturday . 
“In the second half, there was not 
enough awareness and not enough 
intensity to contain [Michigan],” 
George said. “We just have to have more pride in our defense. Nothing 
is going to change unless our de-
fense changes.”
Florida’s late-game struggles continue in loss to Michigan
hoops , from page 13Frazier playing new positionSeniors win final home match
percentage.
Mann, the Southeastern Conference 
Player of the Year, said the middles owed 
their success to their teammates.
“The way we excelled tonight was defi-
nitely due to our amazing passing,” Mann said. “Even on defense, our back-row play-ers were able to get the ball in good posi-tions for Taylor [Unroe] to distribute re-ally evenly. And I think the fact that Taylor spread the ball so well gave us a lot of open looks throughout the stretch.”
Tangerine Wiggs was one of three se-
niors to play her last match in the O’Connell 
Center, but she gave it little thought.
“It was exciting to play our last game in 
the O’Dome, but by no means do we want 
this to be our last game we play,” Wiggs said. “We don’t want our last game to be until very far in December. Our main goal is much further down the road.”Wise said her team was still learning 
about itself three months ago. Now, the players are much more comfortable with their roles and what they need to do to advance past the Sweet 16 for the second consecutive year.
When the Gators first faced the Long-
horns, they were still adjusting after los-ing Noami Santos-Lamb to an ACL tear. Now, they have grown accustomed to the lineup.
“We were making it up on the fly a lot,” 
Wise said. “Right now, we have a much better idea of who we are. We take that ex-perience but know the score is 0-0 when we walk on that floor – their floor.”VolleyBall , from page 13George
“The way we excelled tonight 
was definitely due to our amazing 
passing.”
