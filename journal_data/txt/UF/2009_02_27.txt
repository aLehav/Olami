After Peaceful Paths, an organisation that 
aids battered women, burned down early 
Wednesday morning, a UF club reached out.
Victory Over Violence, a domestic violence 
awareness organization at UF, increased its promised donation to Peaceful Paths. The or-ganization already planned to donate 45 per-cent of its proceeds from its upcoming produc-tion of “The Vagina Monologues” to Peaceful Paths. 
But after the fire, Victory Over Violence 
said they would donate 90 percent, said De-nise Calle, an active member of Victory Over Violence.
“When I first heard what happened, I start-
ed crying,” said Calle. “But it gives us a lot of motivation to make things better.”
“The Vagina Monologues” features a se-
ries of women who discuss the hardships and delights of being a woman, from screaming orgasms to embarrassing bodily functions. In 
2008, the production brought in $900 to $1,000, 
Calle said.
Ten percent of the proceeds will go to 
V-Day, a global movement to end violence against women. Originally Peaceful Paths was to split the proceeds with Arbor House, a shel-ter for pregnant women. 
But after the fire, Victory Over Violence 
thought it best to donate the full 90 percent to Peaceful Paths.
Arbor House agrees it’s the right thing to 
do.
“I think that is wonderful, and we plan to 
help in any way that we can,” said Gwen Gad-aire, director of Arbor House.LOCAL

ST. AUGUSTINE — UF will 
take another stab at securing funds 
this year to take care of 34 historic buildings in St. Augustine.
The university is seeking about 
$32 million from the state and al-most $5 million from the National 
Park Service. About $10 million is pegged for a visitors’ center, and $27 million is for restoring the buildings.
Ed Poppell, UF’s vice presi-
dent for Business Affairs, was in 
St. Augustine on Thursday pre-
senting the plan to officials from the city, the state and the National Park Service, as well as city resi-dents.
Poppell said UF would like to 
see the buildings preserved for 
their historic value, so UF students and 
professors can con-
duct more research 
in the area.
The College of Design, Con-struction and Planning, he said, studies the preservation of histor-ic buildings in St. Augustine. UF’s archaeologists study a variety of things in the city as well, he said, 
and the College of Law uses the 
city to study historic law. 
Poppell said UF is considering UF seeks $37M to preserve historic Florida buildings
University hopes to conduct more research there

2 men arrested for taking train on joyride
MIAMI (AP) — Authorities say they’ve arrested two 
men who took a 120-ton freight train on a joyride in Mi-
ami earlier this week.
Miami-Dade police say 23-year-old Alex Johnson-
Self and 21-year-old Brandon Dowdy were found and arrested Wednesday. A CSX employee reported Mon-day that a diesel locomotive had disappeared from a southwest Miami-Dade turnaround late Sunday night. It was recovered about 7 miles to the south a few hours later. No injuries were reported. The two men face sev-eral charges, including grand theft and burglary.

Underage drinking targeted
Five underage drinkers were 
arrested Wednesday when GPD 
officers did a routine check of bars in midtown.
Three were arrested at Balls 
and two at Copper Monkey, ac-cording to a GPD press release.
Also, two Gainesville bars 
and four convenience stores were caught selling alcohol to minors.
GPD sent underage shoppers 
into gas stations and supermar-kets to buy alcohol, the GPD re-lease stated.
After going to 33 stores, four 
employees from four gas stations including Texaco, 4909 N.W. 39th St., and Kangaroo, 1255 W. Uni-versity Ave., were given written arrests for selling alcohol to un-derage customers.
In three of the stores, a 17-year-
old successfully purchased a 16 oz. 
can of Tilt, the Anheuser-Busch al-
coholic energy drink.
“Our goal for this detail was 
zero arrests,” said GPD spokes-man Keith Kameg. “We are get-ting a lot closer to our goal. Four out of 33 isn’t that bad.”
To crack down on underage 
drinking at Copper Monkey, Rob-
ert Smith said he was hired by 
owner Richard Kesselring.
As a state-certified private in-
vestigator, Smith said he came up with  solutions to catch those at-tempting to drink underage.
Patrons must show two forms 
of valid ID to get a 21 and up wristband, Smith said.
In addition to a Florida driver’s 
license, a credit card or student ID card must be shown, Smith said.
“If they don’t have either of 
those, they have to sign our log-in sheet,” Smith said. “Then we check the signature on the sheet with the signature on their ID.”
Smith also installed six cam-
eras throughout the bar. He said the two girls who were arrested 
Wednesday showed security val-id ID cards that stated they of age. When GPD came, the girls gave officers their real licenses that 
showed they were not, he said
Smith said that he plans to im-
plement scanners so that security 
can scan IDs to make sure each is real. The scanners will cost about $1,200 each, he said.

Patrol focuses on warnings
What’s blue and white and 
crashes your party at 3 a.m.?  
It’s the Gainesville Police 
Department’s Party Patrol, but there’s good news: The police 
would rather give warnings than 
citations.
In 2007, the Party Patrol issued 
more than 1,000 noise warnings but fewer than 50 noise citations. Complete information for 2008 has not been released, but GPD Lt. David Rowe said that the numbers usually stay static from 
year to year.
Since 2000, the unit has cruised 
Gainesville on Fridays and Satur-
days to make sure that get-togeth-ers stay within legal limits.
The unit has five officers on 
duty each weekend from about 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Lowe said the patrol enforces  
underage drinking rules, open container laws and the state open-house party law, which holds hosts responsible for making sure minors don’t consume alcohol.
According to GPD spokesman 
Keith Kameg, the patrol’s goal is to encourage responsible behavior in local residents, especially stu-dents.
The Party Patrol mostly focuses 
on enforcing noise ordinances.
“Noise is the number one fo-
cus,” he said. “Drinking is second-ary but not ignored.”
UF finance senior Andres Val-
buena said the Party Patrol gave him written warnings at his Coun-try Village apartment.
Valbuena said that he and his 
friends were playing a drinking game when a GPD officer respond-ed to a neighbor’s complaint.
“He gave us a warning,” Val-
buena said. “But he said if he had to come back again, it was going to get serious.”

The Alligator implied that Citi-
zens for Good Public felt GLBT rights would be “collateral dam-age” of Amendment 1. That quote 
was taken out of context, accord-
ing to Jim Gilbert. The nullification of the sexual orientation provision in the Code of Ordinances is collat-eral damage from the City Com-mission’s actions in tying all rights together in the cities’ charter.

STUDENT LIFE
By REBECCA WEISS
Alligator Contributing Writer 
 
For the first time, UF is offering a 
two-week study abroad program to 
Antarctica and Argentina.
“It’s an amazing opportunity 
for students to study abroad in a destination most of us only dream about,” said Kirsten Laufer, a study abroad adviser at UF’s International Center. 
Students who partake in the six-
credit program must take a semester of two online classes before the expe-dition to Antarctica and Tierra Del Fu-ego, Argentina, during winter break.   
The trip offers students the chance to explore glaciers, 24 hours of daylight and one of the greatest concentra-
tions of wildlife, such as penguins, 
seals and orcas, Laufer said. 
UF chose to offer the program 
because student interest in the region has increased, she said.  
“It’s completely independent of the budget,” she said. “We’ve gradually expanded our offerings yearly, and 
it seemed like a good year to begin 
running a program in Antarctica.”
The cost of the program is $8,976 
for undergraduates and $9,666 for graduates.  Laufer said the fee cov-ers the cost of student participation and is higher than some of the other study abroad programs offered.
Ten to 12 spots are open for this 
year’s trip, she said, adding a few students have already registered. The deadline to sign up is March 31.

Fox renews ‘The Simpsons’ 
through season 22 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Fox 
says it’s renewing “The Simp-
sons” for another two seasons, 
which will secure its place as TV’s 
longest-running prime-time se-ries.
Now in its 20th season, “The 
Simpsons” already had tied re-cord-holder “Gunsmoke.” The Western drama series aired for two decades on CBS before it end-ed in 1975.
“The Simpsons” will pass that 
mark next season. The two-year, 44-episode pickup announced Thursday by Fox will bring the 
total number of “Simpsons” epi-
sodes to 493.
The animated comedy about 
Homer and Marge Simpson, their children and the town of Spring-
field is not only enduring but 
much-honored: It’s received a Peabody and 24 Emmys among 
other awards.
SoCal aquarium blames 
flooding on curious octopus
SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) 
— Staff at the Santa Monica Pier 
Aquarium in California say the 
trickster who flooded their offices 
with sea water was armed. Eight-armed, to be exact.
They blame the soaking they 
discovered Tuesday morning on the aquarium’s resident two-spot-ted octopus, a tiny female known for being curious and gregarious with visitors.
The octopus apparently tugged 
on a valve and that allowed hun-
dreds of gallons of water to over-
flow its tank.
Randi Parent, spokeswoman 
for the aquarium, says no sea life 
was harmed by the flood, but the 
brand new, ecologically designed floors might be damaged by the water.� 61 PERCENT OPPOSED 
THE INITIATIVE.
By CHELSEA KEENAN
Alligator Writer
 
Sixty-one percent of the 
nearly 10,000 students who 
cast a ballot in this week’s Stu-
dent Government elections 
voted in favor of withholding 
funding from facilities that re-
quire biometric data, such as a hand scan, for entry. 
The passed initiative is 
binding and will be incorpo-
rated into the Student Body 
statutes.
Its implementation would 
affect Rec Sports, since the organization receives most of its funding from students’ Ac-tivity and Service Fees, which make up SG’s nearly $13 mil-
lion budget. 
UF Rec Sports director Da-
vid Bowles said he was sure he could work out a solution 
with SG leaders and would not comment further.
A similar question ap-
peared on fall’s SG ballot.
But though 84 percent of 
students voted against re-quiring hand scans to gain 
entrance to UF recreational fa-
cilities, little resulted since the 
question was a referendum 
and was therefore nonbind-
ing.
Orange and Blue Party 
Sen. Ben Cavataro presented legislation during a fall Sen-ate meeting which, if passed, would have required hand 
scans be optional for entry in order for funding to be given. 
The majority of senators voted 
against the legislation.
As a result, several sena-tors from the Orange and Blue Party worked on collecting 
1,300 signatures to have the question appear as an initia-tive on spring’s ballot, accord-ing to Orange and Blue Party 
Sen. Jonathan Ossip, who au-
thored the question. 
“We’re lucky voters have 
more sense than the Senate did,” Cavataro said, adding 
since the initiative passed, it 
will be made into law during 
Tuesday’s Senate meeting. 
“It becomes a law just as if 
it was passed by the Senate,” 
he said. 
Senate President Jordan 
Johnson said the hand-scan initiative is a classic example of an elections tactic used by 
the Orange and Blue Party to 
rally support, adding he will be happy when SG puts the is-
sue to rest. 
Ossip disagreed and said 
Johnson’s claim was ridicu-
lous.
“It’s something the stu-
dents actually want,” he said.Voters reject hand scanners
“We’re lucky voters 
have more sense than 
the Senate did.”

UF RESEARCH� THE GOLDEN DOOR PROJECT WILL 
BEGIN ITS TRIAL RUN SUNDAY.
By MARY WILLIAMS
Alligator Contributing Writer
 
Homelessness can’t be solved in a week-
end, but one UF graduate hopes his project 
will open the doors to the solution. 
On Sunday, Dirk Sampselle, director and 
founder of Citizens for Social Justice, and his 
staff will begin the Golden Door project, a stu-
dent-run transitional housing and educational rehabilitation program for homeless people.
The trial run will take place at Sunrise Vil-las apartments, 3010 S.W. 23rd Terrace.
Sampselle said he realized a few forums 
and awareness events a year is not enough 
to solve the problem of homelessness in 
Gainesville. So he created an organization fo-cused on utilizing students’ abilities to solve the problems, CSJ, which celebrated its first anniversary in January.
Sampselle said he is working with St. Fran-
cis House, which owns the Sunrise apartment complex, to conduct the trial run with eight residents already living there.
 Currently, residents have a case manag-
er who keeps them on the plan  they set up, which includes employment, rent, loss of in-come and educational needs, said Kent Vann, executive director of St. Francis House.   
The case manager, who only meets once a 
month or when needed, works with several 
residents at a time, but Sampselle said he wants 
the opposite by having several caseworkers 
for each person. Each adviser will assist in one of seven fields: goal discovery, arts mentoring, financial literacy, health and 
nutrition, communication skills, rights literacy or pet therapy.
The program will provide mental and 
physical health care, job placement and vo-cational training, adult education and GED opportunities and a broad spectrum of edu-cational mentoring and support services, ac-cording to its Web site.
Sampselle plans to work out the problems 
of the trial version by the summer and revamp 
the program by fall to implement the full 
eight-month program. 
Vann said he did not have any hesitation 
about working with the student-run organiza-tion.  
He said St. Francis currently has a partner-
ship with UF for volunteering and has found students have always been loyal to fulfill their tasks. 
Vann said he would like for the Golden 
Door project “to maintain self-sufficiency and not fall back into the gaps” and for CSJ to someday have its own facility. Student-run program helps Gainesville homeless

A failing economy may be your 
lifeline.
Data released by the Florida 
Program for Shark Research indi-cates overfishing and the economic 
downturn may be behind the recent 
decline in shark attacks.
According to the International 
Shark Attack File released last week by the program, which is jointly ad-ministered by the Florida Museum of Natural History, the number of unprovoked shark attacks decreased from 71 in 2007 to 59 in 2008.  
While this may sound like good 
news to some, George Burgess, di-rector of the program, said the de-cline in attacks is partially explained by the decrease in the shark popula-tion due to overfishing by humans. 
“Almost everyone will tell you 
the real story isn’t shark bites man, but man bites shark,” Burgess said. 
Burgess said regulations need to 
be put in place to stop overfishing, 
which, according to the file, has left 
many shark populations at “criti-cally low levels.” 
Other factors might have led to 
the decrease as well, including fewer beachgoers, Burgess said. 
With the dismal state of the 
economy, people are less inclined to travel, so there have been fewer 
tourists at beach destinations, Bur-
gess said. There has also been a gen-eral decline in travel since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he said. 
People may also be getting smart-
er about protecting themselves from shark attacks, he said. Media hype in recent years has played a role in educating people about safe practic-es, such as not swimming at dawn or dusk when sharks are feeding, he 
said. 
Of the 59 attacks last year, 41 oc-
curred in U.S. waters, according to 
the file. With 32 attacks, Florida had the most in the U.S. 
Burgess said Florida, with the longest coastline in the U.S. and warm waters, which support more species of sharks and attract a lot of tourists, is “an accident waiting to happen.”
“There’s lots of water and lots 
of people that come to use it, and 
amazingly enough, there have been 
lots of shark attacks,” he said. 
According to the file, 56.6 per-
cent of the attacks involved surfers or windsurfers. 
“The activity of surfers is, by def-
inition, quite provocative,” Burgess said. 
The motions that surfers make 
while in the water mimic those of animals the sharks consider prey, he said. Thus, most incidents involving surfers are better characterized as bites than attacks because after nip-ping the surfers, sharks usually real-ize their error, he said. 
Kevin Neal, who has surfed for 
six years and has lead eight surf-ing trips with UF’s Travel and Rec-reation Program, or TRiP, said the program has never experienced a shark attack. 
Trips are planned so they don’t 
occur when sharks have migrated to Florida, he said. Also, leaders al-ways consider factors such as water temperature and clarity, which can increase the likelihood of attacks, be-fore allowing surfers in the water.
Neal said sharks are always pres-
ent, but with proper precautions, the 
chances of getting attacked are so 
small surfing is worth the risk. 
“It’s just something that you ac-
cept with the sport,” he said. “Every sport has its risks, and this is one of them.”
Global drop in shark attacks may be linked to economyNewsLocal

Today’s question: Would you have voted on Thursday’s question?Thursday’s question is unavailable due to technical error.Column
If People magazine had a face, I would punch it. 
Hard. Nineteen-year-old Mike Tyson hard.
This publication is the opposite of what its name 
implies. Its coverage is inhuman.
At People, it seems that exploiting vulnerable celeb-
rities earns you a medal of honor. Rihanna gets mauled by Chris Brown; John Travolta’s son dies; Britney Spears does anything: Capture these events at all cost.
How is it morally OK to hound a battered woman? 
Does their quest for the $100,000 photo really outweigh their ability to consider her feelings? One pop star’s do-
mestic abuse is an opportunistic cameraman’s stroke of 
luck. Appalling.
Americans are sold short by this magazine on a 
weekly basis, and it isn’t going to stop. 
Who’s to blame? I’ll quote my favorite consonant 
from “V for Vendetta” to answer that one. After hi-jacking a British television station and its emergency 
broadcast channel, V announces to all of London “there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn’t there?” Rather than blaming someone else, he tells the city, “you need only look into a mirror.” 
Our unhealthy obsession with famous people is 
turning our nation into drooling, complacent tabloid whores. We are all becoming Gossip Girls.
We allow this garbage. Some even crave it. We are 
surrounded by it, and we’ve stopped caring. It has be-come part of our society, so we shrug it off because it’s expected.
I shouldn’t point a finger at anyone else before point-
ing at myself. I watched some of the “Surreal Life.” A house full of once-upon-a-timers intrigued me. At the time I wondered where the hell these people had been. I watched a few episodes and was horrified. I quickly re-alized Flavor Flav, Brigitte Nielsen and the gang had disappeared for a reason.
Unfortunately, their mugs re-
turned to the silver screen at a cru-cial time for their I’ll-do-anything-for-some-face-time careers. Reality TV was crap when everyday folk were the stars, but the reemer-
gence of faux celebrities turned hardened dog-doo into Satan personified. The Hollywood writers’ strike hit, 
and these show-biz corpses once again became the top 
ticket. 
The news is littered with this trash, too. Spare me the 
Brangelina bullcrap, I want pertinent local and national 
news. Hell, at this point, I’ll even sit through some in-
ternational disaster buzzkill.
And there it is.
In general, Americans don’t give a damn about the 
rest of the world. We’re part of an egotistical landmass with two giant moats on either side. We’re in our bubble and we don’t like to leave.
To shield our country from the rest of the world, we 
collect shiny, expensive things, so we can tell ourselves everything is dandy. If we can’t afford that, we live vi-cariously through the people who can. We have the ca-pability to stay informed, and we take it for granted.
Leave Britney alone for a few weeks. Let Rihanna’s 
face regain its luster. Don’t bother Travolta for a few years.

Fridays.Please excuse the Department of Darts & Laurels if we ap-
pear a bit woozy as we attempt to recover from our oh-my-god-our-heads-are-killing-us Student Government 
elections hangover.
From co-sponsoring last week’s debate series to providing 
behind-the-scenes SG pre-party coverage on Twitter, it’s been one heck of a journey tracking UF’s battle among political heavyweights. Sure we’ll miss those laugh-a-minute YouTube offerings from the Orange & Blue Party, but can you honestly stomach any more video montages featuring the likes of Jor-dan Johnson crawling across your computer screen? 
As we peel off our Unite Party stickers (riiiiiight) and bid 
farewell to Progress banners of Ben Dictor rubbing elbows with Lil Wayne, the Department of Darts & Laurels proudly 
presents this week’s oh-thank-heaven-SG-elections-are-no-
more edition of... 
Darts & Laurels
For one young woman from Indiana, drenching her lice-
ridden hair in gasoline seemed like a surefire solution to elimi-nate her excessive itching. The Department of Darts & Laurels chucks an it’s-flammable-for-Christ’s-sake DART at Jessica 
Brooks for burning more than half her body after her hair 
caught on fire. Sure we’ve heard of some truly absurd natu-
ral remedies for curing lice, but this one just seems to scream Scientology.
Word out of Washington informs us of ambitious initia-
tives in the healthcare sector set to take shape at the hands of the federal budget. For his unequivocal willingness to over-haul health care and bring assistance to millions of uninsured Americans, the Department of Darts & Laurels graciously ex-tends a change-we-can-believe-in LAUREL to President Ba-
rack Obama. So many presidents pepper their stump speech-es with unfulfilled promises, but finally we have one who has seemingly bucked the trend.
With today marking the final edition of one of Denver’s 
leading newspapers, the city is in a state of mourning as it pre-pares to say goodbye to a dear friend. The Department of Darts & Laurels launches a the-country-just-got-a-little-bit-stupider DART at the journalism industry for failing to prevent the 
closure of the Rocky Mountain News just months before the 
paper’s 150th anniversary. In such perilous economic times, 
dare we ask what paper could be next on the ol’ chopping block?
By passing one of the hot-ticket ballot referenda in the SG 
election, tobacco products may no longer have a lawful place on the UF campus. For taking a definitive stance against the leading cause of avoidable deaths, the Department of Darts & Laurels presents a there’s-nothing-sexy-about-yellow-teeth LAUREL to the UF Student Body. Clearly if Tim Tebow 
proudly boasts about being tobacco-free, The Gator Nation will quickly follow suit.
For the Republican Party’s alleged “rising star,” a gross 
misstep in his speech Tuesday night has the citizens of Wash-ington state reeling. The Department of Darts & Laurels tosses a have-you-ever-heard-of-Mount-St.-Helens? DART at Loui-
siana Gov. Bobby Jindal for questioning why “something called volcano monitoring” was included in the economic stimulus package. Come on, is that really your best shot at 
condemning the Obama administration for allocating contro-
versial funds?
A casual afternoon strolling the Port Charlotte mall quickly 
turned into an episode of “Jackass” as one youngster decid-ed to strip naked and streak from the movie theater to food court much to the chagrin of conservative moms everywhere. For filming the event and securing a getaway car to escape to safety, the Department of Darts & Laurels laughs as we give a we-only-wish-we-could-have-seen-the-looks-of-bewilder-
ment-on-everyone’s-faces LAUREL to Brandon Krueger. Too 
bad he didn’t have the self-restraint to refrain from posting the 
film on his MySpace page — shockingly, even security guards know how to use the Internet.
That’s all for this week. Have a great weekend!

Letters to the Editor
Column misses business effects
Columnist Johnathan Lott ap-
parently needs to spend more 
time in class because his knowl-edge of markets is sadly lacking. In a competitive market, such as 
the market of cities trying to at-
tract high-tech companies, brand-ing is very important.
Gainesville currently has a 
good brand as a progressive and open-minded city, which allows it to attract more progressive tech companies. If Charter Amend-ment 1 passes, then Gainesville’s 
brand becomes the city that voted 
to strip rights from two minority groups. This is bad business, and that is why the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce opposes Charter Amendment 1. 
The only “business” that is 
harmed by stopping Charter Amendment 1 is discrimination.
Ryan Vandeventer
4AGLott’s argument too flimsy
I was disappointed to see that 
Johnathan Lott’s column reverted to the same arguments that pro-ponents of Charter Amendment 1 have been using to scare people 
into supporting discrimination. 
His economic argument is flim-
sy in light of the Chamber of Com-
merce and North Central Florida Labor Council’s opposition to Charter Amendment 1.
Furthermore the amendment is 
opposed by the entire City Com-mission, the Mayor and even our 
own Student and Faculty Govern-
ments because they understand that Charter Amendment 1 is real-ly about discrimination. The sug-gestion that this bill is not about sexual identity/orientation is cat-egorically false. 
It seems Lott is the one who 
has not read the proposed Charter 
Amendment 1. A spokesman for 
the organization who proposed the Charter Amendment, the de-ceptively named “Citizens for Good Public Policy,” admitted in 
this paper on Wednesday that the 
proposed Charter Amendment 1 takes away anti-discrimination protections from lesbian, gay and bisexual people — I believe he re-ferred to this reality as “collateral damage.” 
Are the members of this com-
munity really OK with dismissing 
someone’s rights as “collateral 
damage”? I certainly hope not. 
Let’s show these citizens there 
is no place for discrimination in Gainesville.

Proposal fosters homophobia
In response to Johnathan Lott’s 
justifications for Charter Amend-ment 1 in his Thursday column, I think Benjamin Franklin phrased it best when he said: “They who can give up essential liberty to ob-tain a little temporary safety, de-serve neither liberty nor safety.”
As with most legislation, 
there’s plenty of pork to dissatisfy people on both sides of the issue.
Charter Amendment 1 prom-
ises to not only remove the rights of LGBT members in our society but also prevent sexual preda-tors from invading women’s rest-rooms.
The loss of rights of the LGBT 
community has been described as “collateral damage” in the march towards the “greater” good of removing predators from bath-rooms. 
I have to ask, though. What’s 
preventing predators from walk-ing into any bathroom now and 
committing a heinous act?
Lott would like to think that 
under current legislation, busi-
nesses would be forced to create new special bathrooms; howev-er, even as a cynical libertarian, I don’t believe the government could get away with such a mas-
sive overhaul on business infra-
structure. 
Proponents of the amendment 
would have you believe that un-der current law, some people might become “uncomfortable” at the act of a transgendered person entering their bathroom.
Last time I checked, the U.S. 
Constitution protects individuals and groups from outright harm or discrimination, not to not feel offended.
We must not forget who’s at 
the source of this hate speech: Ultra-neo-conservative religious groups who want nothing more than to restrict the rights of people 
different from them. 
It’s classic homophobia, pure 
and simple.

Guest column
To Eric Chianese:
In your Thursday column, you ar-
gued that “some advances in technol-
ogy,” generally in the field of mass commu-
nication, “cause just as much harm, if not 
more, than they do good.” 
To a certain extent, I agree with you. 
Technology has provided a means for which 
people can entirely sequester themselves from others, as illustrated by your reference to the iPod shuffle or the kids of the future “hanging out” but recoiling into their sepa-rate digital worlds. Technology, specifically SMS and texting, have replaced centuries-
worth of appreciation for vocabulary with a 
:P or a >:/ to convey a particular feeling.
However, the same advances in technol-
ogy that you criticize for inhibiting  commu-nication are actually the same vehicles that facilitate broader communication, develop new sense of communities and even help developing nations. In this way, I argue that they do more good than harm.
In countries with governments that pro-
vide little to no infrastructure or with terrain that limits Internet penetration, cell phones provide the masses with a way to effectively 
conduct business and stay connected. Fish-
ermen in the Philippines use cell phones and texting to find out the market-rate price of fish before selling at markets. Residents of unstable countries in the developing na-tions use cell phones and texting to acquire news and information normally unavailable to them because of military regimes or state-imposed censorship.
Cell phones have also fostered political 
discourse and civic participation. Because of the popularity and feasibility of e-voting, the Hungarian government conducted SMS elections in 2002. That same year, China en-abled its citizens to text to 2,987 deputies of the National People’s Congress to voice their concerns. In 2001, a circulated text message calling for the oust-ing of corrupt Filipi-no President Estrada was instrumental in organizing protests 
and his subsequent 
removal from office. These examples rep-
resent the tip of the iceberg for the positive changes that can come from technology.
Contrary to your argument that texting 
limits social interaction, teens in Japan and Hong Kong use texting to build romantic re-lationships.
Because their cultures heavily survey 
them and limit their private time, teens in those societies resort to technology to build interpersonal relationships. In certain patri-archal societies, texting has encouraged fe-males to be more aggressive and outspoken — patterns of expression that are character-istic to Western culture. 
Technology does not completely dis-place traditional modes of communication; instead, it creates a new mobile culture that is capable of transforming gender roles and altering interpersonal communication.
During the dawn of the Internet, critics 
feared that the Internet would make people more anti-social. Because many day-to-day activities could be done without ever leav-ing the computer, they hypothesized that people would become more distant. Instead, the Internet has had the opposite effect for those individuals who utilize its wider com-munication capabilities. The same can be said for cell phones and texting.
In this sense, technology is a double-
edged sword: it can be the means to box yourself in your own little world, or it can make the world your oyster. 
It depends on your motivations for using 
it.

The band Copeland, UF quarterback 
Tim Tebow and speaker Joe White drew 
2,957 people to the O’Connell Center Thursday to learn about Christianity.
After Dark, sponsored by Christian 
student organizations, presented the Gospel and aimed to inform students about Jesus Christ and his teachings.  
Sophomore Doug Cloud, a member of Campus Crusade for Christ helped spread the word about the event.  
He said religious events are needed on 
campus.
“People need to see how powerful Jesus 
Christ can be,” he said. “If one person or a couple hundred people realize that tonight, it’ll be successful.”
After Copeland performed, getting the 
crowd hyped up, Tebow followed with a speech about how Jesus has impacted his life. 
He said his life is a success, and it’s not 
because he won a national championship 
or because he won a Heisman. It’s because 
he has a relationship with Jesus Christ, he said.When White took the stage, he showed 
a black-and-white video, which led into his re-enactment of a Roman cross-maker, cre-ating the cross similar to the one on which Jesus  was crucified. 
As he chopped at a log on stage, White 
spoke of the young cross-maker’s possible 
thoughts and questions. 
Later, in an act of penance and devotion, 
attendees filled out cards and nailed them 
to the wooden cross on stage. 
“I think it’s a relevant way to present the 
story of Jesus,” UF sophomore Carly Coff-man said. “He’s letting people decide how they see Jesus fitting into their lives.” 
Others disagreed and were disappoint-
ed by the performance, feeling that they were tricked into going by the advertising, which did not make clear the event’s reli-gious nature.
“I think it’s ridiculous because they 
didn’t really tell you what it’s about,” said UF freshman Rachel Sereda, “It seemed really cool because they had balloons and shirts and were really organized, but if 
you read the fine print, it’s all about Jesus 
Christ.”

Budget cuts and possible tuition 
hikes getting you down? Try head-
ing south of the border. 
As the Florida Legislature pre-
pares to consider a bill this spring 
that would raise the cost of tuition by as much as 15 percent in Florida’s 11 public universities, 128 of Mexico’s public universities have pledged to reduce education fees and increase the number of scholarships in an ef-fort to stop students from dropping 
out or postponing graduation, ac-
cording to The Chronicle of Higher Education News Blog. 
During the next academic year, 
Mexico will spend $180 million to increase the number of federal schol-arships from 234,000 to 310,000, said Rodolfo Tuirán, Mexico’s under sec-retary for higher education, accord-
ing to the blog. 
The blog reported that while tu-
ition at Mexican public universities 
is “usually free or very low, lab fees and other expenses can run in the hundreds or even thousands of dol-lars.”
However, a similar infusion of 
federal financial aid may not be nec-essary in Florida. 
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
said she is not aware of a sig-nificant number of UF students having to drop 
out due to the dismal state of the economy because many are covered by the Bright Futures Scholarship Program. According to the Florida Board 
of Governors’ Web site, during the 2006 to 2007 fiscal year there were 
26,105 Bright Futures scholars at 
UF. 
Additionally, 635 federal schol-
arships totaling about $1.3 million were awarded to UF students, more than any other public school in the state, according to the site. Across Florida, a total of 1,520 federal schol-arships summing up to about $3.6 
million were awarded to public 
school students.
The Web site also shows that 
the overall number and amount of scholarships awarded to Florida public school students has been steadily increasing. 
In 2001, a total of 148,704 schol-
arships totaling about $274 million were awarded. In 2007, 187,595 scholarships were awarded totaling $443 million. 
It is uncertain whether the eco-
nomic stimulus package President Barack Obama signed, which could infuse Florida with $12 billion over 
the next three years, will affect fi-
nancial aid. Sikes said UF has pro-posed using the possible funds for construction projects on campus.

fundamental obligation to maintain public 
safety, and urges the adoption of Amend-ment 1, which would require the civil 
rights categories enumerated in Gaines-
ville’s Code of Ordinances to conform exactly to the corresponding code of the State of Florida.
The immediate legal effect of the amend-
ment’s adoption would be the retroactive nullification of non-conforming catego-ries, meaning that civil rights protections in Gainesville would be exactly the same 
as in the rest of Alachua County and most 
other Florida cities.”
Equality is Gainesville’s Business:
“We oppose Charter Amendment 1 be-
cause it promotes discrimination. If passed, Charter Amendment 1 would remove non-
discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender people.
Since state and federal law do not yet 
prohibit discrimination based on sexual 
orientation or gender identity, this means 
someone could be fired from their job, kicked out of their home or refused ser-vice at a restaurant simply because of who they are.
There is no place for discrimination 
in Gainesville. That is why groups like the Student and Faculty Senate and the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce 
have publicly opposed Charter Amend-
ment 1.”
 
If your opponent succeeds what are the 
possible effects on the way local, state 
and federal entities govern Gainesville 
citizens?EGB: “If Amendment 1 passes, it would 
eliminate protections against discrimina-tion which only exist at the local level, 
making it legal to fire someone from their 
job or kick them out of their home because they are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgen-der. It would take away our power to enact 
local nondiscrimination laws, and leave it 
to Tallahassee to decide what is best for Gainesville.
To be clear, Amendment 1 would pro-
hibit the City from adopting or enforcing 
any nondiscrimination measures beyond 
those currently in state law. That means, not only would protections based on sex-ual orientation and gender identity be re-
moved, the City could not add other pro-
tections, like veteran status.”
 
CGPP: “The privacy and safety rights of 
Gainesville’s residents, particularly wom-
en and children, will remain compromised.
Sexual opportunists from peeping toms to 
predators — 263 of whom are registered as living inside the city limits — will be le-gally free to enter women’s restrooms and 
other gender-designated public facilities.
And the Gainesville City Commission 
will continue to abuse home rule by pass-
ing special preferences disguised as civil rights, bullying the business community, 
engaging in social engineering and pro-
moting the non-mainstream social agenda of out-of-state special interests instead of those of the people of Gainesville, Flori-
da.”
 In Florida, it is not illegal for a person 
to use the opposite gender’s public 
restroom, according to the Gainesville 
City Attorney. All Florida business own-ers have the right to establish separate 
bathrooms and refuse admittance to 
a particular individual. What does this 
mean for your cause?
EGB: “This means Charter Amendment 1 
is not and never has been about bathrooms 
or who can go into them — it is about dis-
crimination. Our opponents are using 
scare tactics with absolutely no basis in reality to try to fool voters into legalizing 
discrimination.
There are criminal laws 
that protect people from the dangers that supporters of 
Amendment 1 are using to try to scare vot-ers. Amendment 1 is about discrimination 
— it takes away nondiscrimination protec-
tions and makes it legal to fire someone from their job or kick them out of their home because they are lesbian, gay, bisex-
ual or transgender. Period.”
CGPP: “The premise is untrue. Florida 
Statute, Title XXIX, Chapter 381, Section 
381.0091 empowers businesses to desig-
nate restrooms and dressing rooms by 
gender for the purpose of prohibiting “any female from using a restroom or dressing room designated for males and any male 
from using a restroom or dressing room 
designated for females.”
Assuming consent to disobey posted 
signs is absurd on its face. The signs desig-
nating such facilities in and of themselves 
constitute legal notice by the business. 
Further, the statute does not differentiate between gender and sex, and specifies that in state buildings (which would include 
UF and Santa Fe College) male and female 
restrooms “shall be separate,” and desig-
nated by signs.”
 No complaints of discrimination have 
been filed on the basis of gender identi -
ty since the ordinance was amended. Of 
the 54 complaints filed in 2007, roughly 
two of them were on the basis of sexual 
orientation. What does this mean for 
your cause?
CGPP: “From Jan. 1, 2007 through Feb. 
19, 2009, no complaints of discrimination 
were filed on the basis of gender identity. 
None. Zero.
The absence of a pattern of discrimina-
tion, which is routinely necessary in or-
der to justify new civil rights legislation, 
proves that passing the Gender Identity 
Ordinance was utterly unwarranted, and is an example of the City Commission en-gaging in social activism rather than pub-lic service.
The voters of Gainesville can stop this 
abuse of home rule by voting YES to adopt Charter Amendment 1.”
EGB:  “One of the main purposes of non-
discrimination laws is to put the public on notice that discrimination will not be toler-
ated.
The fact that there were only two dis-
crimination complaints means that the law 
is doing what it was designed to do — pro-
tect against discrimination.
But, even two discrimination com-
plaints are too many.
If Charter Amendment 1 passes, these 
protections would be eliminated, sending the message that it is legal to fire some-
one from their job or kick them out of their home because they are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. If this happens, 
discrimination undoubtedly would in-
crease.”Opposing organizations defend stances on Charter Amendment 1

converting one or two of the 34 buildings into dorms for 
graduate students, so they can conduct their research in the city.
UF originally promised to take over the leases from the 
city, which currently leases them from the state, in July of 2007. The leases would include not only the buildings themselves, but all the historic artifacts, documents and 
other property.
Last year, the state denied UF’s request for $22.5 mil-
lion in funding, which prevented UF from taking over the 
leases.
Poppell said UF is not expecting the entire 
$37 million request this year. That amount 
would be needed over several years. UF is 
hoping to get at least $5 million to fund half the construc-
tion costs of the proposed visitors’ center, he said.
The remaining $5 million for the center is being re-
quested from the National Park Service.
Poppell said in case the state can’t afford the project his 
year, UF and St. Augustine are also requesting the money from the economic stimulus package passed last week, of 
which Florida is expected to receive about $12 billion.
“This is the oldest city, the first city,” he said after the 
presentation, “and the state’s kind of ignored these prop-
erties here.”
“We feel they have a responsibility to come forward 
and rehab them, but also (to) get ready for the celebra-
tion,” he said, referring to the upcoming 500th  anniver-sary of the city’s discovery by Europeans in 1513 and the 
450th anniversary of its settlement in 1565.UF may convert buildings

Southern Civil War re-enactors are 
stereotyped as men who don’t want war 
to end; who believe the South will rise again. 
In reality, it is not for a long-settled 
cause that they rally. These men fight to remember their ancestors and bond with friends gained over years of re-enact-ments.
Randy Adkins, left, brings his family to 
each re-enactment, and his work as a mu-sician comes as a six-string guitar in his tent.  As the grime builds up from sweating 
in heavy period clothing, the rifle remains 
the cleanest thing the re-enactors carry.
The men form their own band of broth-
ers. Some camps keep the period facade 
on long after tourists have left, but many 
of the men in the 28th Georgia, Company K, served in Vietnam or other American conflicts. They don’t seek to recreate those conditions again.

UF and Georgia. Two schools that just 
don’t like each other. A textbook example 
of rivals. Be it on the gridiron, in the pool, the hardwood, or even a spitting contest. 
The gymnastics floor is no different.“Every meet we go into, no matter what 
the team, we always want to put forth our best effort,” Courtney Gladys said. “But in Georgia, it’s a pretty big rival for us.”
The No. 7 Gators head to Athens, Ga., 
to take on the defending Southeastern Con-ference and NCAA champs, the No. 1 Bull-
dogs at 7.UF is coming off its second consecutive 
meet where it raised its season-best score, 
posting a 196.875.
The Gators (5-2, 3-2 SEC) wrap up their 
SEC dual-meet season against the No. 1 team in the nation, which will let the team see how it stacks up against the best compe-
tition it will see in the SEC Championships 
later this season.
“To come and say we beat Georgia, it’s a 
bigger deal, I think,” Corey Hartung said. 
“They’re ranked No. 1. If we can beat 
them, then we know that we can win SECs and that we can win nationals. Here’s our testing point for the season.”
UF and Georgia have a dramatic and 
close history. Last season, the Gators were unable to register a win against the Bull-dogs, with two of the losses coming by the slimmest margin possible, .025 — once at home on Jan. 18, 2008, and the other com-ing in the SEC Championships.
“You do try to do your best against 
them because they are such a top school, and they’re always going to be good com-petition,” junior Melanie Sinclair said.
Hartung and Georgia’s Courtney Ku-
pets have some history of their own. The pair trained together for five years in their pre-college days in Gaithersburg, Md., at Hill’s Gymnastics.
“We’re great friends,” Hartung said. 
“I’m probably closest to her from their team because I trained with her for five years. I look up to her too.”
While there’s no love lost between the 
two, Hartung and the Gators know a win this weekend would be an impressive ad-dition to their resume. 
In a sport largely devoid of trash talk-
ing, UF-Georgia may be the closest teams 
ever come to harsh words, or at least light-
hearted verbal exchanges.
“I don’t know if a Dawg can stand up to 
a Gator,” Sinclair said. 
She added that the team played around 
in practice, barking to mimic the sound UF will encounter in Stegeman Coliseum.
Faehn said this weekend’s meet would 
be used as another tool to evaluate the team 
and see what needs work as the dual-meet 
season dwindles.
“We have to not put too much emphasis 
on this being a big competition and treat it just like any other,” she said.

like Georgia.FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 2009 � ALLIGATOR, 11

The Gators are focused.
So focused, in fact, that coach Buddy Al-
exander had no clue his team was named Golfweek’s Team of the Week on Feb. 16.
“I didn’t even know that,” Alexander 
said. “I guess I haven’t checked out my new Golfweek this week.”
This is the type of mentality the No. 5 
UF men’s golf team will need as it heads to San Juan, Puerto Rico, to play in the Puerto Rico Invitational this weekend.
The team will be joined by three of the 
other top-five teams: No. 2 Georgia, No. 3 Oklahoma State and No. 4 Alabama.
Coach Alexander believes this tourna-
ment gives the Gators a perfect opportu-nity to look in the mirror and find out who they really are.
“We are going to get to play some of the 
better teams in the country and get a chance 
to see where we are,” he said.
With two first-place finishes to open the 
spring season, an aura of 
overconfidence has the potential of seeping into the team’s psyche. But 
Alexander is not wor-ried.
“We are nowhere 
near where we want to be in the rankings, so we’ve got plenty of room 
for improvement,” he said. “So we are not going over there with an overconfident at-titude that I’m worried about in any way.”
One thing UF can be confident about is its advantage in the short game in Puerto Rico.
The event will be played on Bermuda 
greens, which the Gators play on year-
round. Most of the teams in the field do not 
have this luxury and are more accustomed to playing on bent-grass greens.
“When you grow up over these greens, 
typically you’re inclined to be a little more comfortable on them than guys who grew up on bent-grass greens,” Alexander said.
The five golfers for UF this weekend are 
Toby Ragland, Billy Horschel, Tim McKen-ney, Tyson Alexander and Mu Hu.
If UF can use this advantage to help it 
toward another first-place finish, it will eclipse the two previous tournament wins.
“A win ... would really be a statement 
to this team that we are ready to compete with almost everybody,” Alexander said.UF MEN’S GOLF

After shutting out No. 6 Michigan on 
Wednesday, UF pitcher Stacey Nelson said she felt like she could have pitched four more games. She might have the op-portunity to do that this weekend. 
The No. 2 Gators (13-2) will host the 
Cox Communication Invitational at Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium this weekend when they take on four different teams — Pacific, South Florida, Illinois and Texas Tech — in a six-game span.
Nelson, who said she was unusually 
energetic for Wednesday’s game, had a plan for how she’ll deal with the back-to-
back-to-back doubleheaders.
“I guess I should save my abnormal 
amounts of energy,” she joked. “We’ve 
been playing five, six games a weekend up until now, so it’s tiring, but it’s just an-other weekend.”
UF coach Tim Walton echoed his 
pitcher’s thoughts, adding that he does not plan to make many adjustments to the 
way his team usually prepares. The only 
thing Walton will do to the lineup this weekend is reduce the amount of time left fielder Francesca Enea will play.
Enea, who suffered her second torn 
ACL in her right knee in September, is batting .450 with 18 hits and 25 RBIs in her 40 at-bats this season. 
The junior should still see 
time at the plate, and the Gators have plenty of tal-
ent to put in left field.
Speedy freshman Michelle Moultrie 
has primarily played as a pinch runner this year, but she displayed her potential as a hitter in the Cathedral City Classic in Palm Springs, Calif., last weekend. 
In UF’s game against UNLV on Sat-
urday, Moultrie scored on an inside-the-park home run — the first hit of her col-lege career.
Moultrie also played left field against 
the Rebels, allowing Enea to act as the designated hitter, and Enea took advan-tage of the opportunity by going 2 for 3 at the plate and driving in 2 runs.
Despite the number of innings the 
Gators will play this weekend, center fielder Kim Waleszonia said the tourna-ment has its benefits — especially after having spent last weekend over 2,000 miles away from Gainesville.
“I’m glad we’re at home. I can sleep 
in my own bed,” Waleszonia said. “It’s tough to play that many games in one 
weekend, but we worked all fall for it and 
conditioned for it. It’s always tough on our bodies by the end of the weekend, but we’ve trained for it, so we’ll be all right.”
UF will start the Invitational today at 
4 p.m. against Pacific (5-4) before taking on South Florida (10-5) immediately after-ward. 
The Gators will play their second dou-
bleheader of the weekend Saturday after-noon at 4 against Illinois (10-4) and Texas Tech (3-10).
The Gators have already beaten Texas 
Tech this season, as they beat the Red Raiders 11-0 on Feb. 13 in Gainesville.
UF will wrap up the tournament Sun-
day with its third doubleheader — re-matches with Illinois and South Florida.UF to play 
six games

UF guard Nick Calathes calls a play during the Gators’ 82-68 win against Vanderbilt Saturday, Feb. 21 in the O’Connell 
Center. UF hosts SEC East rival Tennessee on Sunday at 2 p.m.
By MIKE DiFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator.org
Late in UF’s 81-75 loss to LSU on Tuesday, ESPN cam-
eras caught guards Nick Calathes and Erving Walker in 
a verbal altercation.
The players said Thursday the incident was nothing 
more than a misunderstanding.
“Me and Erv are cool as can be,” Calathes said. “It was 
in the heat of the moment.”
The confrontation occurred after 
Walker brought the ball up the court on a failed UF possession.
“I wouldn’t say there was an argu-
ment,” Calathes said. “We were both mixed up. I went in the wrong place, and he was obviously in my position. 
It’s not a big deal.”
UF coach Billy Donovan said he 
wasn’t concerned about it.
“That’s just two guys wanting to win,” Donovan said. 
“I think that any time you have a team, family environ-
ment where two guys are trying to get on the same page, that’s going to happen. If anything, it was a sign that both of those guys care.”
ESPN’s Jimmy Dykes made the point during the tele-
cast that, in a late-game situation, Calathes should be the one with the ball in his hand and that Walker should have known to defer to the older player.
But if UF (21-7, 8-5 Southeastern Conference) finds it-
self in a close game late against Tennessee (17-10, 8-5 SEC)  on Sunday at 2 p.m. in the O’Connell Center, statistically the Gators are in better hands with Walker at the helm.
Calathes is shooting 71 percent from the free-throw 
line this season and missed critical shots down the stretch against South Carolina and Kentucky.
Conversely, Walker is shooting 86 percent from the Calathes, Walker ‘cool’ after televised confrontation

The UF baseball team is in a familiar 
place.
At this point last season, the Gators 
were also undefeated, and they had brought 58 runners across the plate and 
had 58 hits. This season, those numbers 
are at 48 and 60, respectively.
But at this point last season, UF 
headed to Coral Gables and promptly lost two of three games to Miami.
This time around, the Hurricanes 
(3-1) remain a measuring stick for the 
Gators (5-0) early in the year, and the 
teams begin a three-game series in McKethan Stadium at 6:30 tonight.“We definitely have a bad taste in 
our mouth from last year,” sophomore third baseman Josh Adams said. “It’ll 
be fun, though. Def-initely will be fun.”
The No. 24 
Gators made their first appearance in the Baseball Amer-ica rankings this 
week, and a series victory against the Hurricanes should 
boost them higher in the polls. After five games, UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan 
seems content with his team and the 
lineup he has been using.

When UF heads to Athens, Ga., on Sun-
day at 2:30 p.m. to face Georgia in the regu-
lar-season finale for both teams, there will be 
a lot on the line.
For one, the No. 17 Gators (23-5, 9-4 
Southeastern Conference) don’t want to en-ter the postseason having lost four of their last five games.
Aside from that, UF is still vying for a 
first-round bye in the SEC Tournament. A loss could knock the Gators out of one of the top four spots.
“That’s more motivation to go in there 
and win,” junior forward Sharielle Smith said. “We’re the type of team that plays bet-ter under pressure when we have something to play for.
“When something huge is on the line, 
our mindset is completely different. We play tougher. We play like, ‘Look, we’ve got to get this win.’ It doesn’t matter how we win, who we beat. We have to win.”
If the seeding wasn’t enough motivation 
for the Gators, playing one of their biggest rivals on their home floor is.
Georgia (16-12, 6-7 SEC) had lost five 
straight games entering before beating Ken-tucky on Thursday, so the Bulldogs desper-ately need a win against the Gators to salvage any hope of an NCAA Tournament berth.
UF expected Georgia’s best shot anyway

� THE UF MEN WILL ALSO FACE FSU 
ON TUESDAY.
By JOSEPH R. HOLZER
Alligator Writer
They’ve had a week to rest, catch up on 
school and lick their wounds. Now, the Gators 
women are hitting the road again.
The No. 13 UF tennis team will play FSU in 
Tallahassee at 1 p.m. Saturday.
The team is infiltrating hostile territory 
with last week’s Southeastern Conference Player of the Week Marrit Boonstra, who is also the No. 7 singles player according to the Intercollegiate Tennis Association. Boonstra’s usual doubles partner, Megan Alexander, sat out the 4-1 win against Troy on Saturday with a sore back.
Coach Roland Thornqvist said the junior is 
listed as day-to-day.
Saturday would be the best time for her 
return, as the matchup against the Seminoles puts the Gators (6-3) back into the situation of playing high-caliber teams away from home. Their three losses have been on the road.
FSU (6-2), on the other hand, marched into 
Baton Rouge, La., and dismantled then-No. 23 LSU squad 5-2. 
The win moved the Seminoles into the top 25.
Thornqvist doesn’t believe their No. 24 
ranking is a fluke.
“They’re much better 
than that, in my opinion,” 
he said. “They have a great 
team this year. They have one new player who’s, I guess, been out ... that I think is fantastic.”
That player is Noemie 
Scharle, ranked No. 48 and playing on Court 2. In ad-
dition to the freshman, FSU has two other 
players, sophomores Katie Rybakova (23) and Federica Suess (81), in the top 100.
Freshman Jessica Alexander welcomes the 
challenge, saying she was excited to play an-
other in-state rival.
But Thornqvist believes this FSU team is 
superior to the ones he’s played in the past.
“This is the best team that they’ve had, 
probably, ever,” Thornqvist said. “We have our work cut out for us.”

Alligator Writer
The last time UF’s men and women won 
Southeastern Conference Indoor titles was 2004 
in Lexington, Ky. This weekend, UF track and field returns to this familiar site, hoping for the same result.
Coming off their best season performance in 
the split Tyson Invitational and the Iowa State Classic, the Gators will look to the experience of 
their upperclassmen to lead them. 
In addition to already competing in Ken-
tucky this season, UF has athletes who have 
already had success in previous SEC Champi-onships.
UF traveled to Kentucky for the indoor sea-
son opener back in January, when the team ad-justed to the oversized track and captured one NCAA automatic-qualifying mark and seven 
NCAA provisional-qualifying marks. 
The teams hope to use this experience to aid 
them in their SEC Indoor title quest.
“We know the track. We’ve been there,” 
coach Mike Holloway said. “It makes you a 
little bit more comfortable.”
On the men’s side, junior Calvin Smith, who 
has consistently ran provisional-qualifying times this season, was an SEC Outdoor cham-pion in the 400-meter dash as a freshman.
At the SEC Indoor Championships during 
his sophomore season, Smith claimed second and fourth places in the 400-meter and the 200-meter dash, respectively.
Smith thinks his experience will somewhat lighten his load. 
“My experience should help me. I’ve been 
there before, so I’m not gonna be as nervous,” Smith said.  “I know what to expect. I know ev-erybody’s gonna bring it, so I need to bring it, too. I feel like I should go out there and compete better than I did the first two years and drop 
my time.” 
Joining Smith in the experience and success 
column is senior Carlos Phillips. 
In his freshman season, Phillips was part of 
UF’s distance medley relay team that took first 
place at the SEC Indoor Championships. He finished fifth in the 800-meter run during the Championships.
With the aid of his prior experience, Phillips 
looks to achieve his goal of capturing the elu-sive SEC 800 title in Kentucky this weekend.
“Their training, their God-given abilities 
come into large play here, but I think the big-gest is that we’ve prepared very well,” Hollo-way said. “As long as we stay focused and as long as we go in there with great determina-tion, we’ll do just fine.” 
The competition gets underway Friday at 
4:30 p.m. with the women’s pentathlon.SEC experience fuels UF By MERCEDES MACHADO

For a girl who never really knew if 
swimming was for her, senior Laura-
beth Guenthner has left her mark on the UF swimming and diving team.
However, she found that the sport 
sucked her in after she committed to a year-round team at age 9. 
She swam on her team at Welling-
ton High, was named Most Valuable Player from 2002-04 and was a state finalist in the 200- and 500-yard free-styles those years. This was just the be-ginning of her career. She continued to shine after entering what she considers 
an amazing experience at UF.
“To be on the team is a major ac-
complishment,” Guenthner said. 
“Nothing really beats swimming for the Gators.”
Guenthner became part of the UF 
women’s swimming team as a fresh-man walk-on.  In her first year she was one of three freshmen to qualify for the 
2006 NCAA Championships.
“I’ve improved dramatically, and 
I’ve had goals for winning an SEC and 
NCAA title,” Guenthner said.
She helped her team win the wom-
en’s title last week at the Southeastern  Conference Championship in Auburn, Ala. She set personal records in all her events, including the 1650-yard free, 500-yard free and 400-yard individual medley. She snatched fourth in the 500 free and second in the 1650 free.
“It was the most exciting experi-ence, and I’m so proud of our team this 
year.” Guenthner said. “This was the 
highest I’ve ever placed at the SECs, so I was really happy with my swims.”
Guenthner still has an opportunity 
to increase her impact at UF. She will participate in the NCAAs in a month and hopes that she and her team can accomplish whatever they desire.
Guenthner will graduate in Decem-
ber and hopes to attend nursing school next spring.
“I’ll miss the sport of swimming for 
sure, but most of all I’ll miss my team-
mates and being around them every single day,” Guenth-ner said.
This swimming 
all-star has even competed at the na-
tional level, placing 10th in the 800-meter free and 1,500-meter 
free at the 2007 ConocoPhillips U.S Na-tionals Meet. After the 2007-08 season she snatched her first All-American honor by finishing sixth in the 1650 
free at the NCAA Championships in 
Columbus, Ohio.
Guenthner hopes to inspire young 
athletes with this simple message:
“Dream big and believe in your-
self,” she said. “You can only be as good as you think you are.”
Her four years at UF have treated 
her well.
“Honestly, my experience at Florida 
has been a dream come true.”Senior departs on top

“Even if they hadn’t lost five straight, just 
the fact that they lost to us already and it’s at 
their gym, it’s going to be hard,” Smith said. “We, at this point, expect everybody’s best 
shot. Everybody always steps up their game 
when they play us.”
Junior guard Steffi Sorensen echoed what 
Smith had to say, but she knows the Gators brought the attention on themselves.
“As the year went on, our target on our 
back got bigger, and I think we got a taste of that as far as those three times we lost, people played their best games against us,” 
Sorensen said.
The other thing Sunday’s game will have 
in common with four of the Gators’ five loss-
es this season is that it will be on the road.
UF is still searching for that signature 
SEC road win after failing to achieve it at Auburn, Vanderbilt and LSU, three of the top five teams in the conference.
While the Bulldogs are 
not as highly touted this season as they have been in recent years, a win for 
the Gators in Athens could 
do a lot for their NCAA Tournament resume and 
seeding.
Smith appears ready for 
the challenge of facing the 
hostile environment and all that’s at stake.“I’m glad that that pressure’s there be-
cause it makes me more confident,” Smith said. 
“Our team is more confident when we 
have to play under pressure. Going to Geor-
gia is going to be tougher than usual,” Smith 
added. “We’ve already beat them, so they’re going to be coming at us even harder.”
The Gators will have to respond with 
their own intensity if they want to stake their claim for the conference.

As much as the Gators say Miami is just another 
team, the intrastate rival brings out the competi-
tive juices in all the players. O’Sullivan purposely 
avoided talking about Miami with his players ear-lier in the week so they would stay focused on their midweek series with Eastern Michigan.
“It’s a big series like it is every year,” senior first 
baseman Brandon McArthur said. “Both teams coming in with high expectations, a lot to prove early in the season, but you’ve also got to remem-ber that it is early in the season.”
While the series against Florida State is spread 
out over two months, the Gators get the Hurricanes all in one weekend.
“It’s definitely in the top two (rivalries), between 
this and Florida State,” McArthur said. “As soon as you throw that first pitch, it’s going to be intense.”The first pitches for UF will come from the same 
arms as last weekend, with senior Patrick Keating (1-0, 2.57 ERA) getting the start tonight followed by 
freshmen Alex Panteliodis (1-0, 3.00) and Nick Ma-
ronde (0-0, 0.00) on Saturday and Sunday.
O’Sullivan expressed confidence in his two 
freshmen, though he stressed not making a big deal out of their starts in a rivalry.
“Is this a big one? Absolutely,” O’Sullivan said. 
“But as a coach, you try to downplay it as much as you can. They put pressure on themselves to begin with.”
But much of the attention toward the mound 
heading into this series has been on Miami ace Chris Hernandez (1-0, 1.50). The left-handed sophomore, who finished 11-0 in his freshman year, shut down the Gators in the third game of last year’s series.
“That All-American we’ve got to face (Friday) 
night, you know he had a lot of success against us last year, so we’ve got our work cut out for us,” O’Sullivan said. “He didn’t look like a freshman 
last year.”UF focusing on Miami’s ace Hernandez
stripe and is the team’s best free-
throw shooter.
Calathes has more than proven 
himself to be the team’s best player this season, but his lack of consis-
tency from the line has become 
somewhat of a liability.
Donovan said he thinks it’s im-
portant to have both Calathes and Walker on the floor during crunch time and that he won’t rely on just one player to take over in those situations.
“It’s shared responsibilities,” 
Donovan said. “I think they both can play back there together, and I think they both understand that. It’s not necessarily one guy.”
Calathes took over late against 
North Carolina State on Jan. 3, scoring 24 points in the second half, including the game-winner with 11 seconds left.
Walker made two key 3-point shots in UF’s win against Auburn and rallied the Gators back late against Georgia with his outside shooting despite the loss.
“They can complement each 
other pretty well,” Donovan said. “It gives us two shooters, two scor-ers, two playmakers.”
C a l a t h e s 
went through a similar situation last season with former UF point guard Jai Lucas.
Lucas de-
cided to transfer 
to Texas earlier this season because he no longer felt UF was “the best fit” for him.
Calathes agreed that there is no 
reason both he and Walker can’t play well together in critical situ-ations.
“I think we both can,” Calathes 
said. “Sometimes I’ll play (shoot-ing guard), and sometimes Erv will play (point guard).”Two guards to be playmakers
