season, sat out the year because of a shoul-
der surgery -both would have been week-
end starters.
Instead, Panteliodis and Maronde took
their spots i the first series of the season
against a top-10 Louisville team.
From the start, they showed they be-
longed.
"I really don't look at it like they
were freshmen last year. I really don't,"
O'Sulhvan said. "I know a lot of people
from the outside-i look at it like that, but
hey, they are good."
Combined, the two didn't show any
nerves as they pitched more than 12 innings
and allowed two earned runs while walk-
ing only one batter i the opening series of
2009.
But as the scouting reports grew more
extensive on the first-year pitchers, so did
their ERAs.
"It was great for me from a pitching
standpoint," Maronde sad. "BuTt I dont
thik I reelly reelized what it was until the
season came around and how difficult it
would be."
Throughout the season, the ERAs and
levels of success for the three fluctuated, but
they still presented the team with some of
its best outings.
Panteliodis and DeSclafani finished tied
for the team-high in wins while Maronde
tallied the most strikeouts last year for the
Gators.
Each of the three pointed to then-senior
Patrick Keating as the one who showed
them the ropes.
Ironically, they surpassed the veteran
in the pitching rotation due to the senior's
struggles midway though the season.
Keating began the year as the team's ace
but ended it in the bullpen. He only logged
seven starts before his understudies took
over for him.
"They earned everything that they got,"
O'Sullivan said. "There was nothing given
to any pitcher last year.
"Patrick was an All-SEC pitcher the year
before,iand some of the young guysjjustoout-
pitched him -it's as simple as that. You tryto make decisions with your brain, not with
your heart."
O'Sullivan's Guys
After two top-5 recruiting classes,
the team is starting to take the shape of
O'Sullivan's particular mold.
The trio of sophomore pitchers is a per-
fect indication of that.
After nine seasons as a pitching coach at
Clemson, he knows how to evaluate top tal-
ent at the position.
Since O'Sullivan arrived in 2008, the team
ERA has dropped each season.
He came to a team that struggled under
its previous coach, Pat McMahon, and fin-
ished with an ERA of 5.27.
But in O'Sullivan's first year, UF's team
ERA fell to 4.39 and the downward trend
continued last season as it fell to 4.27 -al-
most a whole run less than when he first ar-
rived.
"Wheniwe first got here, ouregoalws to
deepen the pitchigostff," O'Sullvans sid.
"That's not done overnight.
"It takes more than one recruiting class,
but we feel good about where we are at
right now."
The depth of the pitching staff is it's
strength, as is evident from this weekend's
rotation.
Johnson's emergence in his first year has
given the Gators plenty of options for their
rotation.
"We have five or six guys who probably
could start anywhere in the country," Ma-
ronde said.
O'Sullivan's philosophy of playing the
best players no matter how young they are
is paying off.
The competition has increased among
the pitchers, and 11 of the staff's 17 are
O'Sullivan's recruits.
"Above all, he is a pitching specialist,"
National Scouting Coordinator for Perfect
Game USA Allan Simpson said. "He's been
around, and his reputation as a pitching
coach is pretty established, and high school
coaches send their players to him because
they know he really knows his pitching."
Sophomore PitchersHis resume demands respect, too.
"I really trust him and his judgment and
what he is going to say to make me and the
rest of the pitching staff better," DeSclafani
said.
But the most impressive thing is the de-
velopment of the pitchers.
The five freshmen arms already look at
sophomores Maronde, Panteliodis and DeS-
clafani as leaders and mentors.
"He knows how to scout and recruit
pitchers, and hejust knows how to develop
them," Simpson said. "He has a good track
record for taking a rock and putting the fin-
ishing touches on it."
Growth
From the start, the trio has been on a fast
track.
This year they are taking on a new role
on the team: leaders.
With such a new group of arms, the
sophomores have beei forced to the fore-
frmnt mice agi -this time to guide the
newcomers along.
"I definitely try to help the young-
er guys," Maronde said. "One of coach
O'Sullivan's big things is leadership, so I
try to pass down what they taught us last
year."
But they will be expected to do more than
just become leaders this season.
If No. 7 Florida is going to meet expecta-
tions, the sophomores will have to make an-
other jump in production from their fresh-
man years.
O'Sullivan said he would like to see dou-
ble-digit wins and ERAs of less than 4.00
this year.
"All of these guys pitched great last year,
and now they have a year under their belts,
Toledo said. "They are ready to go. I think
this year is going to be special."
If they don't produce, they could get a
dose of their own medicine.
"They have some battles this year,"
O'Sullivan said. "A couple of these fresh-
men are pushing them."
Panteliodis, Maronde and DeSclafani
wouldn't have it any other way.

Jury finds former officer not guilty of abuse
Herbert Priester and his wife, Tabitha Priester, react to a not-guilty verdict outside the Alachua County
Criminal Justice Center on Thursday afternoon.0 HE FACED CHARGES OF
ABUSE AND NEGLECT OF HIS
2-MONTH-OLD DAUGHTER.
By MINCH MINCHIN
Alligator Writer
After nearly two weeks of
testimony, Herbert Priester, a
former Gainesville policeman
charged with abuse and neglect
of his infant daughter, has been
found not guilty of both charges.
According to Chief Assistant
State Attorney Jeanne Singer,
Priester became frustrated with
his then 2-month-old daughter
and squeezed her, breaking six
of her ribs and injuring several
of her internal organs in January
2007.
Priester said the family's
75-pound Dutch shepherd, Ban-
dit, caused the injuries.
According to testimonies last
week, Bandit had a history of "er-
ratic" behavior, including once
consuming several square feet
of leather couch upholstery and
tearing up a doll.
But prosecuting attorney Sean
Brewer was not convinced."[The dog attack] may be pos-
sible, but it sure as heck isn't rea-
sonable," he said in his closing
statement.
State attorneys said after
Priester assaulted the baby, he
forced Bandit's jaws open and
dragged his teeth across the in-
fant's torso to create the impres-
sion of a dog attack.
"It's been a long three
years. When you have the
truth on your side, it makes
things easier."
Herbert Priester
former policeman
Upon hearing the not-guilty
verdict from Circuit Judge Ysleta
W. McDonald, Priester dropped
his face to the table and began to
weep.
"It's been a long three years,"
Priester said, moments after
the decision. "When you have
the truth on your side, it makes
things easier."
Priester's daughter, now 3, is
healthy.
Bandit remains in Gainesville
with different owners.
SPECIAL REPORT
Ruling favors free speech
By SAMANTHA DELGADO
Alligator Contributing Writer
A UF sophomore received a status update
on a lawsuit her mother filed in 2007 against
her high school principal.
A federal judge ruled Katherine Evans can
move forward with a suit she filed after her
principal suspended her for creating a Face-
book page critical of her high school English
teacher, according to court documents found
on the American Civil Liberties Union of Flor-
ida Web site.
On the Facebook page, Evans described her
teacher as "the worst teacher she ever had."
Maria Kayanan, one of Evans' lawyers and
the associate legal director of the American
Civil Liberties Union of Florida, said moving
forward with the lawsuit represents a signifi-
cant step for student rights related to social net-
working Web sites.
"It's a recognition by the court that herspeech was protected by the First Amendment,
and the principal should have known that,"
she said.
Evans said she is hoping to have the suspen-
sion removed from her academic record.
"The case pretty much speaks for itself, and
my rights were violated," she said.
According to the court
documents, she hopes to be
compensated for being de-
prived of her First Amend-
ment rights and also hopes
to receive money for attor-
ney fees.
Students who use Face-
Evans book for academic purposes
should not worry about get-
ting in trouble for what they post, Kayanan
said.
"Students' opinions of their teachers are
protected, as long as they don't urge violence,"
Kayanan said.NYT reporter visits UF
By ROBERT IMFELD
Alligator Contributing Writer
Andrea Elliott has told many stories
in her career at The New York Times.
Before a crowd of about 150 Thurs-
day night, she told the one that won
her a Pulitzer Prize.
The reporter spent eight months at
a Brooklyn mosque learning about the
hardships of being a Muslim prayer
leader after Sept. 11.
"I was trying to understand Is-
lam," she told the audience at the Reitz
Union Rion Ballroom. "He was trying
to understand America."
Earlier in the day, Elliott partici-pated in a journalism workshop at
the Reitz Union, where she answered
questions about her career to about 15
people.
Elliott said she considers herself
a reporter on Muslims
On rather than a reporter onCampus Islam because her sto-
ries are really about the
people.
Islam On Campus brought Elliott
to UF as part of its Islam Awareness
Month activities.
Islam on Campus paid Elliott $5,000
for her visit, according to Ziad Ghani-
mi, chairman of the Islam Awareness
Month committee.

SG parties spar at debate
-ABOUT 60 PEOPLE ATTENDED.
ByCJ PRUNER
Alligator Writer
In a final attempt to reach voters before elec-
tion day, representatives from the Unite Party
and the Student Alliance party met Thursday
at the UF Hillel to debate about platforms.
Speaking for about an hour, members from
both sides addressed key platform points, in-
cluding a proposed student fee to fund the
renovation and expansion of the Reitz Union.
About 60 people attended.
Ashton Charles, the Unite Party candidate
for spring Student Body president, said the UF
Student Body has outgrown the current stu-
dent union, and new renovations will accom-
modate more student groups.
Rafael Yaniz, the Student Alliance party
candidate for Student Body treasurer, coun-
tered that the proposed fee is fiscally irrespon-sible and not in the best interests of the Student
Body.
"We're in the worst economic recession of
our times," Yaniz said. "It's not only wrong,
it's immoral to go to the students [for more
money]."
"It's not only wrong; it's immoral
to go to the students [for more

Unite Party spokesman Ben Meyers praised
both sides for engaging in a civil discussion
and expressed confidence in the Unite Party's
favorable relationship with the Student Body.
"Once students get involved, they will see
what the party with experience can do," Mey-
ers said. "When we say something on our plat-
form, we mean it."

15K on spring election
By ELIZABETH BEHRMAN

to finance reports.
The Student Alliance party spent
$320.25 on fliers, according to cam-
paign finance reports.
Ben Meyers, spokesman for the
Unite Party, said the party will pur-
chase water and snacks for the cam-
paigners during the next week.
"I predict that, overall, we'll bespending less as the election approach-
es because we already have most of our
supplies and made most of our big ex-
penditures," Meyers said.
The parties are continuing to accept
donations from candidates and sup-
porters.
From Feb. 8 to Feb. 14, the Unite
Party collected $3,530, according to
campaign finance records.
"The center of our campaign is
always going to be issues af-
fecting the Student Body."
Ben Cavataro
Student Alliance party candidate for
Student Body president
From Feb. 7 to Feb. 15, the Student
Alliance party collected $698.
Ben Cavataro, the Student Alliance
party candidate for Student Body pres-
ident, said his party realizes it will be
outspent during next week's election.
"We're going to be outspent in this
election, but we've always felt that
money isn't the most important thing.
We've had a good deal of small do-
nors, including people who aren't even
candidates," Cavataro said. "We need
money to run a campaign, but money
is never going to be the center of our
campaign. The center of our campaign
is always going to be issues affecting
the Student Body."Rep. Meek rallies students
By MATT HARRINGER
Alligator Writer
While many high-profile celebrities and
politicians come to UF to give speeches,
Miami Rep. Kendrick Meek visited campus
Thursday to have a discussion with stu-
dents.
"I thought it'd be better served to an-
swer questions than make a speech," Meek
said. "I can take this discussion to D.C. and
bring some perspective."
About 30 students and local activists
gathered in the Reitz Union for the cam-
paign rally.
It was the Democratic congressman's
fifth visit to UF since announcing his cam-
paign for Senate in January 2009.
Education, which has been a central part
of Meek's campaign, was the most popular
topic among the students.
The representative said when the leg-
islature and governor changed the Bright
Futures Scholarship Program and tuition
rates this year, it was a "bait and switch"
for students.
"Kids held their end of the deal by get-
ting the grade point average to be eligible
for Bright Futures," Meek said. "To pull
the carpet out from under them now, when
some students can't afford to make up the
difference, is almost like a double tuition
hike."
Education has always been an impor-
tant issue for Meek.
In 2002, he spearheaded efforts to passthe Florida Class Size Amendment.
Meek was also critical of FCAT.
In the third grade, he found out he was
dyslexic and said a test like FCAT would
have hurt his education.
"One size doesn't fit all, and that's my
problem with the FCAT," he said.
Dominique Martin, a member of the
Black Student Union, said he started intern-
ing for the campaign last semester because
Meek supports education.
"[Meek] is a supporter of the people,"
Martin said.
The representative's campaign is de-
pendent on volunteers
like Martin to collect
the 112,476 petitions re-
quired for Meek to quali-
fy for the ballot.
Meek wouldn't spec-
ify how many petitions
they've gathered but
Meek said they're in the final
stretch.
If he gathers enough signatures, Meek
will be the first statewide candidate to qual-
ify by petition.
Adam Sharon, a spokesman for the cam-
paign, said qualifying by petition serves as
an organizing tool to reach out to voters.
Sharon said it takes humility for a candi-
date, like Meek, to ask the people of Florida
to put him on a ballot before even asking
for their votes.
All other candidates have qualified by
paying a $10,000 fee.

Editorial
We know none of you have read anything this week -we
realize the Winter Olympics are far more entertaining than any
letter to the editor we have to offer -but please pull your at-
tention away from Shaun White and friends for just a second so
we can present you with this week's after-all-one-of-our-colum-
nists-did-talk-about-curling-for-a-little-bit edition of.
Darts & Laurels
Because we had to burrow through 3 feet of Student Govern-
ment campaign fliers to get to the office.
Speaking of campaign fliers, the Editorial Board would like
to note that Wednesday's swastika fliers are incredibly insensi-
tive and unacceptable. We don't know who distributed them,
and we don't expect we ever will. But we're mustering up all the
disappointment we can express on our faces, looking down our
noses and dropping a you-should-have-known-better DART at
whoever made the fliers.
On the other hand, we do have one nice thing to say about
an SG official, though it was the result of a major pain in the
Editorial Board's ass.
Tuesday night, when a certain supervisor of elections with
a nautical grudge was stonewalling our SG reporter, our com-
mander-in-chief drove over to the Alligator office to deliver the
ballot questions for the upcoming election.
Therefore, we're sticking our tongues out at some members
of SG and placing a necklace of we're-glad-someone-over-there-
is-doing-his-job LAURELS on Student Body President Jordan
Johnson.
We'll get back to our darting in a moment, but we do have
one other laurel for this week.
After receiving pressure from activists to take action against
child prostitution, Choice Hotels, which includes Comfort Inn,
Quality Inn and EconoLodge, has pledged to prevent the crime
in its hotels.
Now, Choice will train staff to recognize child prostitution
and take steps to address it. For this, the Editorial Board is toss-
ing a better-late-than-never LAUREL at Choice Hotels for doing
something noble -though we still don't get why they weren't
doing everything they could to prevent it in the first place.
Getting back to our list of rants, we've noticed recent at-
tention to John Mayer for his Playboy interview, in which he
managed to offend the black community, women and people
in general.
Yea, we know his persistent foot-in-mouth syndrome had a
particularly nasty flare-up, and we even wrote an editorial last
week about verbal diarrhea in celebrities. But this is going a bit
far. If you really think about any of his comments, they're harm-
less. Aren't there more important things to worry about? The
Editorial Board thinks there are, and we're flinging a leave-the-
poor-guy-alone DART at the media in general.
Speaking of the media, we're a little perplexed about the Pu-
litzer Board's decision to make The National Enquirer eligible
for a Pulitzer Prize.
In a truly WTF moment, the Pulitzer Board is considering
giving the Enquirer a prize for its work breaking the story of
John Edwards' affair. We admit it was some serious sleuthing,
but we don't think the tabloid deserves to be rewarded for sen-
sationalizing a private problem. Still, we're more surprised than
anything else, so we're kicking a we-don't-know-if-we're-more-
angry-or-confused DART at the Pulitzer Board.
Last on our hit list is Texas Gov. Rick Perry. In an act of stag-
gering hubris, he announced plans to sue the Environmental
Protection Agency for its decision to regulate greenhouse gases
as a pollutant.
Newsflash, buddy: The fact that you love your Hummer
more than your wife doesn't mean global warming isn't real.
But we suppose it makes sense. Ignorant climate skeptics will
stop at nothing to make sure their cushy lifestyles don't suffer,
so The Editorial Board is hurling a no-one-is-buying-your-"if-
we-ignore-it-it'll-go-away"-garbage DART at Rick Perry.
That's all for this week kids.
Go Team U.S.A!

Baseball season offers relief, hope
t's that time of year again. The smell of freshly cut grassis in the air, and the faint crack of a wooden bat can be
heard in the distance, or at least in your heart. That's
right -it's baseball season. The happiest time of year for
me. Not only is the Gators baseball team getting ready to
open its season -one that offers the hope of another trip
to Omaha, Neb., and the College World Series -but major
league teams are reporting for their first workouts.
Pitchers and catchers have already reported, and hope
has arrived once more in my life. You see, dear readers, I
have the misfortune of having to like teams that have had
successful seasons only before I was born. Because my
dad moved to the United States and his friends liked the
people's team in New York, I became a Met instead of a
Yankee. And I thank God for that. I can actually appreciate
the little successes.
Every year the Mets tease me with promise and hope
early on, jumping into first or second place in the National
League East. But by the beginning of September, they have
usually blown whatever lead they had. Then they manage
to offer some hope again, only to blow it on the last day of
the season against the godforsaken Marlins.
But this year will be different. Last year, we blew it early
because of extensive injuries. You try winning when 22 ma-
jor players get hurt over the course of one season, and only
25 players are on the roster. The early losses made me real-
ize how much I love having edge-of-my-seat hopefulness
and excitement about the team from April until September
and sometimes October.
Hearing David Wright of the Mets come out this week
after showing up to spring training about a week early and
say he expects the Mets to win the division excited me. It
got me so pumped for baseball that I impulsively bought
outfield tickets to the Mets-Rays game in St. Petersburg at
the beginning of April.Now that brings me to our on-
campus sluggers, or should I say
slugGators. We need to show our
support for the Gators baseball team
just like we do for the Gators football
and basketball teams. The team is
Paul Murty young, and it could use our support.
letters@alligator org Especially because heading into the
season it's ranked in the top 10.
At the very least we could use
the distraction of another sport so we don't go insane until
spring break, which still seems forever away.
I just hope the UF team doesn't take me on a trip like the
Mets probably will this year or like the football team took
us on this fall. We've already seen what so much promise
and expectation has done to our two biggest programs. The
football team failed at the second-to-last hurdle against an
Alabama team we were stronger than, and the basketball
team had their three-game-losing streak right after a great
win against Michigan State. Our baseball team has some
tricky away series to play this year against Ole Miss and
South Carolina, so it won't be easy to win the Southeastern
Conference as it is favored to do.
Sometimes we take our other sports for granted because
they don't have the grandeur of football or basketball, but
that hurts us as a university. We have the potential to be a
triple threat in the college sports world, an athletic and aca-
demic powerhouse. My favorite time to be a Gators fan was
from 2006 to 2008, when we won both basketball and foot-
ball championships twice. If we can add a baseball champi-
onship to our repertoire, combined with our already strong
academic reputation, we can become even more highly
ranked and recognized around the world.

FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 2010 U ALLIGATOR, 7
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
Back-to-back lacrosse state cham-
pionships in 2006-07, a spot on the
team at North Carolina -a premier
lacrosse school -in 2007 and an op-
portunity to make a name for your-
self. Sounds like a good deal for the
avid lacrosse player, right?
For sophomore midfielder
Rachael Zimmerman, it wasn't
enough.
Zimmerman had a rough transi-
tion her freshman year and decided
UNC was not for her. She wanted
to be more than just another athlete,
and she needed to find out who she
was.
She then began a journey that
would change her life and give her
a second chance playing for a first-
year lacrosse program. She brought
the experience she gained on her
journey to her role as a leader on the
young team.
Her journey will start its next
chapter when Florida opens its in-
augural season against Jacksonville
on Saturday at 6 in Gainesville.
Start: Colorado
Zimmerman initially wanted to
play soccer at UNC. She told her
family, and her mother, Lisa Zim-
merman-Greenberg would laugh
and say, "Way to dream big."
"She would be on the soccer
field, as a 5-year-old, just growling,"
Zimmerman-Greenberg said. "She
was hilarious."
However, Zimmerman contin-
ued to play, developing her com-A Nen
petitive and resilient attitude.
Although Zimmerman wouldn't
play soccer at UNC like she had
planned, her dedication and drive at
such a young age was a remarkable
sight for her mother.
She said everything her daughter
did was about getting to her goal,
deciding what she needed to do and
what she needed to give up in order
to get what she desired.
Zimmerman-Greenberg encour-
aged her daughter to chase her
dreams.
"We always had that kind of re-
lationship where once you sign up
for something, once you commit to
doing something, you give it 100
percent," she said.
Zimmerman's resilience was test-
ed when she began playing lacrosse
with her brothers, who showed no
mercy despite her gender.
The boys would play lacrosse,
and Zimmerman would be right
there with them.
They would take shots with her
in goal, and despite the barrage of
balls, she never gave up, she never
cried, and she never let them see her
in pain.
She continued to play lacrosse,
juggling it and soccer during the
seventh grade, but eventually chose
lacrosse because the pace and inten-
sity better suited her personality.
However, living in Colorado,
Zimmerman had little options to
continue playing lacrosse, so she
was set on leaving home.
She visited UNC her junior year,
committed to the Tar Heels, and en-
rolled the following year.v Begin
Pit stop: North Carolina
Once Zimmerman got to UNC,
she realized Division-I lacrosse was
not what she had anticipated.
She struggled with being in a
new place far from home and with
the transition into college.
Zimmerman stopped playing
lacrosse in March of her freshman
year.
She then did what she thought
she needed at the time. She took a
year away from the game and col-
lege to discover herself.
Some people would travel the
world, lounge at home and just take
it easy during this time, but Zim-
merman took a dif-
ferent approach to
"taking a break."
"The year I tookLacrosse off, I lived outside
for three months,
backpacking and making fire out of
sticks and rocks," she said.
She then moved back in with her
family and worked the rest of the
summer to complete her sabbatical.
Her time away from the game
and college life gave Zimmerman
the insight she needed, and she
learned she was more capable than
she thought.
"Living outside was definitely
a struggle," Zimmerman said. "Up
and down 85 days with nothing re-
ally, besides some food. It was kind
of like 'Survivor,' but I just figured
that no matter the situation one's
put in, you choose how it's going to
turn out based on your outlook."
Her mother said the experience
was invaluable for her daughternning
even though she couldn't recognize
herself in the mirror when she got
home.
Zimmerman-Greenberg said her
daughter knows more about herself
than most 40-year-old people do
about themselves.
After this experience, Zimmer-
man was ready for the next phase of
her life.
Finish line: Florida
"I was in Idaho one day and I
was just thinking,'Where am I going
to go to school next year? What am I
going to do?' Zimmerman said.
She knew she wanted to re-
turn to college, and after talking to
her father, who told her that a for-
mer teammate at UNC was coach-
ing at Florida, she E-mailed Erica
LaGrow.
LaGrow, one of UF's assistant
coaches, was a senior when Zimmer-
man was a freshman at UNC, and
Zimmerman traveled to Gainesville
for a visit after speaking with her.
For UF coach Amanda O'Leary,
knowing that Zimmerman was
a player on one of the best teams
in the nation and having LaGrow
speak well of her, made it easy to
consider Zimmerman for a spot on
UF's inaugural team.
O'Leary and her staff made an
impression on Zimmerman when
she visited UF.
"I felt very comfortable with the
coaching staff," Zimmerman said.
"They understood that things had
been hard and were willing to work
with me and give me that second
chance."She said part of her decision
about playing Division-I lacrosse
again was based on not wanting to
feel like she was only an athlete.
UF allowed her the opportunity
to play lacrosse without being con-
fined to the role of athlete.
Since her arrival in Gainesville,
Zimmerman has used her experi-
ences as a tool to better understand
and help her younger teammates.
Freshman Lelan Bailey said she
admires Zimmerman's attitude and
work ethic.
"She took a year off, but when
she came back you wouldn't know
it because she worked so hard to get
back in the swing of things," Bailey
said. "She had the courage to come
back."
The sophomore's dedication has
also caught the eye of O'Leary, who
said talking about Zimmerman puts
a smile on her face.
"What she brings is her abil-
ity to communicate the needs of the
team," O'Leary said. "She is sort of
the pulse of the team, which makes
her a critical part of our program."
The traits Zimmerman has
brought with her to UF may be a re-
sult of the roller-coaster ride she has
been on since her junior year in high
school that forced her to fight for a
second chance at playing lacrosse.
Rachael Zimmerman's story
could be dubbed a great comeback,
and the sophomore a warrior.
She said she isn't fond of labels,
but instead she embraces her ver-
satility and willingness to deal with
what life dishes out, personally and
athletically.

Florida rides free throws to key win
Matt Tripp/ Alligator Staff
UF guard Erving Walker scored all of his 14 points from the free-throw line in the
Gators' 78-70 win against Auburn on Thursday night.0 THE GATORS FACE OLE MISS ON
SATURDAY IN OXFORD.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
Erving Walker made zero field goals
Thursday night, but he finished just three
points shy of leading the Gators in scoring.
The sophomore point guard hit 14 of 16
free throws, junior forward Chandler Par-
sons led the team with 17 points and Flor-
ida used a vastly improved performance
from the line as it took down Auburn 78-70
in the O'Connell Center.
The Gators (18-8, 7-4 Southeastern Con-
ference) shot a miserable 48 percent com-
bined from the field-throw line in their loss-
es to Xavier and South Carolina last week,
but UF had plenty of chances to redeem
itself against the Tigers (12-14, 3-8 SEC).
Auburn racked up 29 team fouls, and
UF finished 32 of 40 from the line. Florida
scored its last 15 points on free throws and
made zero field goals in the final 8:24.
"We don't care how we get it -pretty,
ugly -as long as we win," said Walker,
who added six assists to just one turnover.
"That says a lot that we can still score with-
out a field goal in eight minutes. I think
that's good for us."
While UF coach Billy Donovan was re-
luctant to call Thursday night's matchup
a must-win game, Walker said his team
couldn't afford a loss if it wants to return to
the NCAA Tournament.
"We all know if we want to make the
NCAA Tournament, we can't lose a game
to Auburn on our home court," Walker
said.
After a back-and-forth first half, the
Gators tied the game at 42 three minutes
into the second half and went on a 14-5 run
SEE HOOPS, PAGE 15
Ugly or not, Gators' play was just what they needed
almost didn't recognize the Florida
men's basketball team that defeated
Auburn on Thursday night.
A season-low 10 three-point attempts?
Forty free-throw attempts? Making 32 of
those shots from the charity stripe?
This is a team that has had a tendency
to live and die by the three-pointer. There
are many times throughout the last three
seasons that a 20-percent shooting night
from beyond the arc would've automati-
cally meant defeat, no matter who the op-
ponent.
It wasn't entirely pretty, but UF got the
job done against Auburn.
Almost all the way through the Gators'
78-70 win over the Tigers, I thought of dif-
ferent ways to describe just how uninspir-ing Florida's play
looked.
Florida led by just
just three at the half.
UF looked like it was
putting it away with
Phil Kegler a 11-point lead at the
Phil on the Hill 9:39 mark only to
pkegler@alligator org let Auburn keep it
tight.
The Tigers have
three conference wins, and all of them
come against fellow Southeastern Confer-
ence bottom-feeders -LSU, Alabama and
Georgia.
Auburn shouldn't be within four points
with less than a minute left. Florida should
have been able to put this team away, es-pecially on its home floor.
Some lackluster defense and poor
shooting from the Gators' backcourt kept
the Tigers around, but UF got the job done
in a must-win game.
When you're fighting for position on
the NCAA Tournament bubble, you don't
lose to a team like Auburn.
But now I'll make the case that Thurs-
day's win gave the chance for Florida to
learn something about itself.
"We're not going to rely on our shoot-
ing the rest of the year," said Chandler
Parsons, who led Florida with 17 points
on 6-of-1I shooting. "We think we can win
games doing other things."
SEE PHIL, PAGE 15UF blown
out by UK
in 2nd half
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
etorrens@alligator org
UF had a chance to rebound from
its past two blowout losses, but in-
stead of seizing the opportunity, it
fumbled it away.
Instead, it was No. 16 Kentucky
(22-4, 10-3 Southeastern Conference)
that played resiliently in the second
half to claim a 77-51 win over the
struggling Gators, whohave dropped
three straight.
"In the last couple of games, we
have yet to see 40 minutes of Florida
basketball," senior Susan Yenser
said. "It's so frustrating because we
can't pinpoint one thing. It's more of
a mindset than it is Xs and Os."
The Wildcats used back-to-back
three-pointers from Keyla Snowden
to start a 25-2 run
and nab their 10th
conference win.
The loss dropped
coach Amanda
Butler's squad
below .500 in the
SEC for the first
Yenser time this season.
In a worst-
case, d6jA-vu scenario, UF (13-13, 6-7
SEC) fizzled out in the second half
after playing a tightly contested first
half. This time, the Gators had a four-
point lead at intermission.
It was the latter 20 minutes, when
the Gators were outscored 48-18, that
did UF in. Florida turned the ball
over 14 times -as many turnovers
as Kentucky had all game -and
made six field goals after the break.
"If I could vote not to have half-
time, I would definitely vote not to
have it," guard Trumae Lucas said.

12 of them were UK steals. Kentucky
scored 32 points off Gators miscues.

Gators in second at SEC Championships after Day 2
Dwyer sets UF record in 500-yard freestyle
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
After the second day of competi-
tion at the Southeastern Conference
Championship Meet, the Florida
men's and women's swimming and
diving teams are in second place.
The men's team has 282 points
while Auburn is currently in first
with 291 points.
On the women's side, the Gators
have 266 points and trail current
leader Georgia, which is at 300.
"We started off a little rocky, up
and down in this morning's ses-
sion," UF coach Gregg Troy said.
"But tonight we came out here and
swam fantastic. Once finals started
and we got going, I have absolutely
no complaints. "
In the men's 500-yard freestyle,
junior Conor Dwyer swam an
NCAA automatic-qualifying time
of 4:14.58. Dwyer's time marked the
fastest time in the NCAA this season
and the fastest in Florida history.
"It was my first individual race at
SECs. It's also an honor that it was a
Florida record because Balazs (Gerc-
sak) is an amazing swimmer, both
here and internationally," Dwyer
said.
Before Thursday night, the Flori-
da record belonged to Gercsak, who
finished fourth in this year's race.For the women's squad, senior
Gemma Spofforth swam an NCAA
automatic-qualifying time of 1:55.39
in her first place finish of the wom-
en's 200-yard individual medley.
Spofforth won another SEC title
with Shara Stafford, Sarah Bateman
and Stephanie Napier in swimming
a 200-yard freestyle relay time of
1:28.71.
Softball team to open tourney
After a 4-1 start, Florida will be
facing a new set of challenges this
weekend as it hosts the Lipton Invi-
tational.
It will be the Gators' second-
straight season hosting the tourna-
ment. Last year Florida came into
the Lipton Invitational at 3-1 and
came out 8-1.
If they are to match that feat this
year, they'll need senior Francesca
Enea to continue her torrid start.
Through five games, the left
fielder is hitting .438 with three
home runs and 11 RBIs.
If she kept up this blistering pace
for the duration of the season, which
is an unlikely task, she would hit 33
home runs and drive in 121 runs
while shattering almost every Flor-
ida hitting record.
"She's obviously seeing it very
well right now," UF coach Tim Wal-
ton said. "Typically she's a slow

Enea is proving that her Colle-

Watch List appearance, her stand-
ing as an All-SEC first team and All-
America second team member, and
her No. 9 overall selection in the Na-
tional Pro Fast Pitch League Senior
Draft were all well deserved.
The Gators will be facing Camp-
bell (1-2-1) and Kansas (2-3) on Fri-
day before what will likely be their
toughest test of the weekend against
Marshall (4-0) on Saturday.
Florida will then close out the
weekend with a pair of games
against East Carolina, who they beat
4-3 in the season opener.

Gymnastics team to face UGA
The No. 4 Gators want people to
know heading into tonight's meet
against No. 7 Georgia the rivalry
between the schools extends beyond
the football field.
Wednesday, the team went to
the 34th street wall and painted a
portion of it to advertise the meet
against the five-time defending na-
tional champion Bulldogs at 7 p.m.
in the O'Connell Center.Coach Rhonda Faehn said the
team decided to paint the wall on
its own, and that it was a sign the
gymnasts were trying to build up
spirit and draw themselves closer as
a team before the rivals meet.
"It's something they got really ex-
cited about, and I'm sure they'll turn
that passion into the actual competi-
lion and their routines," Faehn said.
Florida hasn't won a meet against
Georgia since 2005 in Athens and
the last time Florida (4-2, 3-1 South-
eastern Conference) hosted Georgia
(3-3, 2-2 SEC), the Bulldogs won by
.025, the smallest margin possible.
The Gators hope to change that
tonight, though.
"They're a really good team, and
you always want to beat them just
so you can say you beat some of the
best out there," junior Alicia Good-
win said.
The rivalry will have a new look
this season. Suzanne Yoculan retired
as Georgia's coach after 26 seasons
and 10 national championships, and
was replaced by one of her assistant
coaches, Jay Clark. Georgia also lost
national all-around champion and

Florida (6-2) returns from that
tournament with two victories
over top-7 teams ready to host an-
other in-state rival, No. 43 USF, on
Sunday at 1 p.m.
UF coach Andy Jackson said the
win over No. 7 Georgia boosted his
team's confidence, but the loss to
No. 2 Ohio State gave the team "a
lot of feedback about what we need
to do to get to a higher level."
UF freshman Sekou Bangoura

more than just the satisfaction of a
victory over Georgia.
Bangoura Jr. was named the
SEC Freshman of the Week after
posting a 2-1 record last weekend
in Charlottesville, Va. at the ITA
National Team Indoor Champion-
ships.
Bangoura, who did not play in
the fall, has faced strong competi-
tion in the majority of his first 11
singles matches.
"It's kind of nerve racking in
the beginning, but I'm getting a lot
more comfortable now," Bangou-
ra said. "I've gotten a lot of help
from the older guys these first few
weeks. I really feel like part of the
team."

UF dominates in frontcourt early
nuurP, from page 13
over the next five minutes.
UF brought the crowd to its feet with back-
to-back dunks: a thunderous left-handed slam
by senior forward Dan Werner and an alley-
oop from Walker to junior forward Alex Tyus.
"I haven't seen that from him in a while.
That was impressive," Parsons said of Wer-
ner's dunk. "White man can jump.
"He's an athlete, what can I tell you?"
Given the team's lack of depth, the Gators
had been looking for bench production, and
Werner (nine points, four rebounds) and fresh-
man Erik Murphy (seven points, three re-
bounds) gave the team the lift it needed.
Murphy had not scored more than four
points since going for a career-high 16 againstPresbyterian on Dec. 30.
Werner has struggled to do anything much
in SEC play, and his nine points were his most
since his 11 points against Vanderbilt on Jan. 9.
"That's huge for those guys to come in here,
spark and give us minutes,"
Parsons said. "When our big
guys get tired or get in foul
trouble, those guys are really
Men's reliable when they come into
Basketball the game."
The Gators relied on their
frontcourttoproduce against
the undersized Tigers before intermission, and
Parsons, Tyus and Murphy combined for 20 of
the team's 37 first-half points.

Saturday at noon. The Rebels fell to Vanderbilt

vided a first-half spark with 12 points.
She scored six straight as part of a
9-2 run to give the Gators a 33-29 lead
before halftime. She didn't score again
but was still the team's leading scorer.
UK's Victoria Dunlap, who was av-
eraging 17.7 points, scored a quiet sev-
en points in the first half. The Gators'
plan to limit her touches worked, and
Dunlap took just five shots.
It was Snowden -shooting 41.6percent from beyond the arc -who
picked up the offensive slack for UJK.
She more than doubled her normal
offensive production in the first half
with 11 points. She played 29 minutes
and finished with a game-high 21 on a
5-of-5 three-point effort.
"Snowden hit and we seemed to
be surprised every single time that
she shot in our face," Butler said. "She
scored one way, and we never took it
away from her."
The Gators will try to right the ship
at home Sunday against Georgia.
PHIL, from page 13
That's a good attitude to have when you're ranked
eighth in the SEC in field-goal percentage and 11th in
3-point shooting.
The Gators' versatility could help them weather a tough
end to the schedule. Tennessee comes to town Tuesday,
and UF ends the regular season hosting Vanderbilt and
traveling to Kentucky. Odds are Florida won't shoot well
one night or won't play good defense another.
The Gators don't really have the prototypical go-to guy

MV 79901L ---when things get rough. Chandler Parsons has been the
team's best player to date, but I'm not sure he could win a
game by himself, and that's no disrespect to him.
But the Gators are going to need to find a way to come
out with wins like they did Thursday.
During the 2007-08 and 2008-09 seasons, Florida lost
12 regular-season games combined during February and
March. Eight of those defeats came against teams that went
on to make the NCAA Tournament.
So when UF's late-season swoons are discussed, it is
worth noting most of the opponents haven't been scrubs.
OFBut that statistic also screams the Gators' top flaw -beat-
ing top-notch teams. Losing against quality opposition is
excusable, but winning shows you're worthy of making the
Big Dance as well.
"We gotta get better resiliency," UF coach Billy Dono-
van said. "I think when you get scarred, when you get
hardened through competition, you build up a resiliency."
We'll see just how battle-tested this Gators team is dur-
ing the next few weeks.
At least now we know they have more than one trick up
their sleeves.

Every eye in McKethan Stadium
zones in on the aluminum bat -an
innocent yet intimidating instru-
ment.
The bat is cocked behind Preston
Tucker's head. It teeters back and
forth, ready to unload.
Piiingg
The incoming pitch fires off
Tucker's bat. Outfielders swiftly
spin around to see it disappear. Sec-
onds later, Tucker's victim bounces
off an unfamiliar surface.
Ball, meet the concrete of Sta-
dium Road.
Tucker, repeating his routine,
hits two more home runs. Bat teeter.
Swing. Connect. Goodbye.
Tucker aims for a light pole be-
hind right-center field. He never hits
it, but he comes close. Ladies and
gentlemen, welcome to the Preston
Tucker Showcase. Grab a seat and
enjoy the experience.
The Gators are still in the pre-
season, and assistant coach Craig
Bell is grooving pitches down the
middle, gift-wrapping batting prac-
tice homers. Not that it would make
a difference.
Just ask UCF relief pitchers Cory
Weech, D.J. Hicks and Matt Good-
year. On April 8, Tucker crushed
home runs off all three relievers 
-
two for grand slams -and finished
the game with 11 RBIs.
Tucker was Florida's most pro-
ductive hitter last season, leading
the team in batting average, home
runs and RBIs. He even set a school
record by driving in 85 runs.
And that was just his first year in
college.
"To do what he did is just
remarkable," UF coach Kevin
O'Sullivan said. "There's been a lot
of really, really good players to have
come through this program, and to
break the RBI record, just being a
freshman, is unbelievable."
When predicting the batting or-
der for his teams in the preseason,
Tyler Thompson
Nolan Fo
Bryson Smith
Austin
MaddoxO'Sullivan said he normally only
knows which players to put at the
bottom of the lineup. But, for at least
the next two years due to MLB draf t
rules, he has UF's No. 3 hitter pen-
ciled in.
Getting noticed
By Tucker's standards, his fresh-
man season was actually pedes-
trian. As a junior at Tampa Plant
High, Tucker broke a school record
with 51 RBIs in 25 games.
But few college coaches were
interested in him. After his record-
breaking season, Tucker only re-
ceived a scholarship offer from
Duke.
Most teams were scared of Tuck-
er's weird swing, Plant coach Den-
nis Braun said.
Tucker was a dead-pull hitter,
always trying to muscle balls into
right field. He also took a hard step
toward the mound before swinging,
giving him lots of power but mak-
ing him look foolish against slow
changeups.
Tucker's form was ugly, and it
worked.
"The smartest thing I ever did
was realize we need to leave this kid
alone a little bit," Braun said.
Tucker's awkward swing wasn't
as easy for scouts to overlook -un-
lil one week in June 2007.
Tucker was a last-minute re-
placement for an injured player at
the USA Baseball Tournament of
Stars, a showcase of 142 coveted
high school prospects.
During warm-ups, the batters'
box became Tucker's stage. The
balls he launched out of the park
did not travel on a line like they do
for most prep stars. Instead, the bat-
tered balls soared high and seemed
to never stop, just like they do in the
Major League.
The same week, Braun coached
the All-American Prospects 16 at
the USA Baseball 16U Champion-
ships in Jupiter.
"I came back to the hotel and I
had 35 messages on my phone,"
he said, "and I knew Preston tore it

Sophomore Preston Tucker broke UF's record for RBIs in a season (85) during his freshman year, and
due to MLB Draft rules, he will suit up for the Gators for at least two more seasons.
up there. Everybody in the nation
wanted him."
The scouting report on Tucker
changed practically overnight. In-
stead of a batter with an undisci-
plined swing, he was now a natural
hitter.
Scouts also gawked at Tucker's
strength, embodied by his "Pop-
eye" forearms.
Tucker, who now weighs about
220 pounds, started lifting weights
at Plant when he was 15 years old.
"I wasn't the biggest kid in the
world," Tucker said. "I was prob-
ably about 165 pounds after my
sophomore year, and there was a
lot of balls I'd fly out to the (warn-
ing) track."
That offseason, the baseball
team worked out with University
of Tampa strength coach Eric Hall,
who has trained two Division-II na-
tional championship baseball teams.
Tucker was the strongest, fastest kid
in the gym, Hall said.
He also worked harder than any-
body else Hall trained, including the
college players.
When he finished his workouts
with Hall around 7 p.m., Tucker
drove to the YMCA and lifted more
weights.
Tucker also asked Hall for re-
sistance-band exercises for his "off
days."
"He knew he was going to the
next level," Hall said. "He knew
what it was going to take for him
to get there. He was, by far, stron-
ger (and) faster. He was doing a
lot more things than the other kids
were.",
Tucker added 15 pounds of mus-
cle this offseason, and his draft stock
rises as he continues to grow.
Draft Dilemma
After graduating from Plant in2008, Tucker was overlooked by all
30 MLB teams during the 50 rounds
of that year's draft.
But scouts changed their minds
after watching Tucker become Flor-
ida's most feared hitter last season.
"If Tucker were in this year's
class, he would be a top-10 pick,"
Baseball America's Aaron Fitt said.
"There are no power bats in this
class that can compare with him."
MLB scouts compare Tucker to
former Vanderbilt third basemen
Pedro Alvarez, Fitt said.
Alvarez, who was the second
pick of the 2008 draft, signed a four-
year contract with the Pittsburgh
Pirates that guarantees him about
$6.3 million.
But Tucker won't be signing a
multimillion-dollar contract after
this season. He isn't allowed to.
MLB Draft rules stipulate a play-
er cannot leave college until he turns
21 or has finished his junior season.
The rule is similar to those in the
NBA and NFL with a few excep-
tions.
While there is an age limit on
players turning pro from college, a
high school player can enter MLB
upon graduation. And so can a ju-
nior college player, regardless of his
age.
Bryce Harper, the 17-year-old
who Sports Illustrated dubbed
"Baseball's LeBron," will be eligible
for the 2010 MLB Draft after receiv-
ing his GED diploma and enrolling
early at the College of Southern Ne-
vada this season.
Meanwhile, Tucker, who will
turn 20 in July, cannot enter the
MLB Draft until 2011.
From now until then, his stock
could fall.
A player's value in the eyes of
scouts is fickle as illustrated by the
story of former Gators third base-man Brandon McArthur
The Minnesota Twins drafted
McArthur out of Seffner Armwood
High in the third round in 2003, but
he rejected a contract offer when his
parents urged him to enroll at UF,
saying he was not mature enough to
play pro ball.
McArthur suffered two season-
ending injuries at Florida, extending
his stay in Gainesville to six years.
He was sucker punched outside
the Grog House in 2003, almost
costing him his life. Then he tore
the ulnar collateral ligament in his
right elbow on opening night in
2007. The next year, he tore the ACL
in his right knee, sidelining him for
two weeks.
McArthur, who now plays for
the Joliet Jackhammers in the inde-
pendent Northern League and still
hopes to play in MLB, was never
drafted after 2003.
"The knee injuries had piled so
high that it was just highly unlikely
that I would get a shot," McArthur
said.
Tucker, on the other hand, re-
mained injury-free his first year on
campus. But even if he stays healthy
for the next two or three years,
Tucker's draft value could fall.
If opposing teams choose to pitch
around him, as O'Sullivan expects,
Tucker's power numbers could de-
crease, dropping him out of the first
round. But Tucker said he does not
worry about projections.
"The draft is always a toss-up,"
he said.
Instead, Tucker sticks to his rou-
tine.
It's what earned him a scholar-
ship. It's what lets him aim for light
poles behind the outfield. It's what
pro scouts will have to settle for un-
til they are allowed to draft him.
