The new semester is already in motion, and 
so are UF students.
Except at Student Recreation & Fitness 
Center and Southwest Recreation Center, stu-
dents wait in line to use gym equipment as if 
they were queueing up for a night out at 101 
Cantina.
Pam Hightower, assistant director of ad-ministrative services with the UF Department of Recreational Sports, said the gyms employ a “one in, one out” system at the beginning of each semester until students adjust to their schedules.
“Usually after week two everyone has ad-
justed and we’re more balanced,” she said. “Right now, people are all coming at the same hours.”
Hightower said the gyms experience the 
heaviest trafﬁ  c after 4 p.m. and the greatest number of incoming gym attendees arrive be-tween 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. Wait times average ﬁ  ve minutes, she said.
Mitch Williams, a ﬁ  fth-year UF chemical 
engineering student and operations manager with the Department of Recreational Sports, said the gyms are packed because students don’t have many responsibilities at the begin-ning of the semester.
“That’s when you’ll see the lines outside 
and the associates acting as bouncers,” said 
Williams, 22. 
Carolina Casariego, an 18-year-old UF 
sports management freshman, said that it’s 
time consuming to work out at SRC.
“It’s just more of a hassle to go,” she said.New semester brings crowds to campus gyms

Slices at Satchel’s Pizza will now feature locally 
produced sausage, according to an announcement the 
pizza staple’s owner, Satchel Raye, made this week.
The restaurant’s switch parallels a national consum-
er trend reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture this month, which suggests buyers are now turning to local food markets more often than they used to.
The new sausage is sourced from two different 
farms in the region: C and J Farms in Gainesville and Full Circle Farm in Live Oak.
Raye said the restaurant ﬁ  rst decided to make the 
change after someone from Full Circle dropped off a 
few samples.
“We had a family gathering and we cooked it on the 
grill, and it was so delicious that I decided we should 
try and switch over to that sausage,” Raye said.

In the hunt for The Gator Na-
tion’s next leader, the Presidential 
Search Committee is reaching out to 
the greater UF community.
Appointed in May, a search com-
mittee was formed with the expecta-
tion of ﬁ  nding a qualiﬁ  ed group of 
candidates to vie for the position of 
UF’s 12th president. The committee is now asking for input in its search process by Friday. 
In an email, search committee 
chair Steven Scott asked that the UF community answer two questions 
on the search criteria of previous 
presidential searches. To provide in-put, students and staff can visit the presidential search website. 
The feedback will form the 
framework for future discussions with candidates, said UF spokes-woman Janine Sikes.
“All of the pieces have to come together in order to formally launch the search for a new president,” Sikes said. 
The search committee will meet 
Sept. 5 to review and consider the 
responses. All committee meetings 
will be live-streamed and archived.
An advertisement for President 
Bernie Machen’s position will be 
placed in The Chronicle for Higher 
Education. 
Student Government President 
Cory Yeffet wrote in an email that the search committee and Board of Trustees have approved a very comprehensive and thorough list of qualiﬁ  cations.  
“With our goal of becoming a top 
10 public institution, it is especially 
important the next UF President has 
a distinguished academic career, in addition to the operational expertise that are needed to lead a $4.4 billion 
dollar operation,” Yeffet said.
Over the summer, an outside 
consultant provided the search com-
mittee with a range of compensation for the next president, and a market-ing plan was approved along with the Chronicle advertisement. 
Sikes said the position criterion is 
extensive. 
“To sum it up, basically we’re 
looking for national leaders with a strong academic background, a re-search academic background,” she said. 
Students like UF biology junior 
Edward Daly ﬁ  nd the search and new criteria important.

Four North Carolina State Uni-
versity students have hit the nail on 
the head with their invention. 
The materials science and en-
gineering students have created a nail polish to help detect if colorless, odorless compounds are being used to drug drinks.
The nail polish, named Under-
cover Colors, changes color when common date-rape drugs such as Rohypnol, Xanax and GHB, have been slipped into drinks. Women can identify the drug by sticking 
their ﬁ  ngers inside their glasses.According to UF Health, about 
one in three American women will 
be sexually assaulted in her lifetime. 
“I’ve never seen someone put 
something in someone’s drink, but 
I’ve been with people who have 
thought someone did,” said UF tele-communication sophomore Sami Wax, 19. “And that is very scary.” 
Similar preventative products have been made available to the public, including coasters that change colors, said Rita Lawrence, 
GatorWell’s interpersonal violence 
prevention coordinator. 
“[It’s] not just women who are 
sexually assaulted, it could happen to anyone,” she said. 
Lawrence said the nail polish can 
be part of a strategy against date rape, but awareness is  key.
Allyson Montoya, a 19-year-old 
UF English junior, said she would consider buying the nail polish when it becomes available to the public.  
“If they have that with them, it’s 
almost like carrying a weapon with you,” Montoya said.Nail polish exposes date-rape drugsMELISSA MIHM

A Gainesville man was arrested Tuesday following a 
heated argument between neighbors.
Javontea Antonio Black, 18, was charged with aggra-
vated assault and throwing a deadly missile after police 
say he yelled at and threatened to kill his neighbor and 
her friend, located at 6025 NW 23rd Terrace.
As the argument escalated, Black walked across the 
street and picked up a ﬂ  ower pot in front of one of the 
victim’s houses, throwing it at them. The victims went inside and shut the door as the pot shattered next to them, according to the Gainesville Police arrest report.After entering a different apart-
ment, Black picked up a metal pipe and returned to the victims, saying “I’ll kill you, b****.” 
After throwing the metal pipe at 
the victim’s house, he ﬂ  ed the scene. 
GPD found Black several blocks 
away and arrested him.
While on the way to jail, Black 
kicked the patrol car’s windows. He was put into a RIPP restraint, which belts the hands and feet, but managed to get out of it. After beating his head against the window, Black told the arresting ofﬁ  cer he was going to shoot her the next time he sees her.Man arrested after hurling ﬂ  ower pot

A sexual violence preven-
tion program is making its ﬁ  rst 
UF appearance today with a campus theater performance. 
SCREAM (Students Chal-
lenging Realities and Educat-ing Against Myth) Theater will host a night of 30-minute skits in collaboration with Gator Wesley as part of its welcome back week activities. 
Since 1991, SCREAM’S skits 
cover topics prevalent to college campuses, ranging from sexual 
assault and domestic violence 
to bullying. 
The skits will then be fol-
lowed by a Q-and-A segment with the actors remaining in character.
Evan Morris, a 20-year-old 
UF marketing junior, is an in-tern at Gator Wesley, the Unit-
ed Methodist Campus Min-istry. Morris saw SCREAM’s 
production last year with Gator Wesley at the United Methodist Seminar program in New York City.
“It’s frightening to see, and 
they’re all really good actors,” Morris said. “You feel like you’re actually there.” 
Morris said SCREAM shows 
the reality of sexual assault on college campuses through its performances. It has been or-ganizing and performing these skits since 1991.
Narcie Jeter, the executive 
director at Gator Wesley, said she wanted to bring the produc-tion to UF and Santa Fe College campuses after seeing the pro-duction last August with Gator Wesley in New York City.
“We thought nothing could 
be better than if we shared the SCREAM Theater’s presenta-tion, as well as additional UF resources,” Jeter said.

on its free show today at 8 p.m. in the University Auditorium.SCREAM Theater

“I think it goes along with

Dennis Stoltzfoos, the 
owner of Full Circle Farm, calls local farming a “lost 
art.”
Unlike most commercial 
farms, Full Circle moves 
its hogs through different 
wooded areas instead of 
keeping them in pens. Ev-ery ﬁ  ve to 10 days the pigs move to a new half-acre lot. No cages, no concrete and no 
processed food.
“There’s a fresh bunch of 
wild edibles, and the pigs get 
to root and express their pig-
ness,” Stoltzfoos said.
Full Circle supplies pork 
to about three other busi-
nesses but is quickly grow-ing.
In the 11 years he’s been 
farming, Stoltzfoos said he’s seen a steady growth in de-
mand for local products.
“Seems like the word is 
spreading,” he said.
Nationwide, the num-
ber of farmers markets has 
increased about 76 percent since 2008, according to the USDA study.
The increase indicates 
a continued demand and 
growth of local farmers mar-
kets and locally produced food throughout the coun-try.
C.W. Phillips, the owner 
of C and J Farms, said he be-lieves the difference between his product and bigger cor-porations is in the raising of 
the hogs.
He said there’s no pro-
cessed food or growth hor-mones involved in his opera-
tion.
C and J Farms supplies 
about 10 local businesses, each ranging from orders of 
30 to 150 pounds of pork a 
month.
It may take a little longer, 
but he said it’s a lot like tak-
ing steroids when you work 
out. You’ll bulk up faster, but not in the good way. You’ve got to eat “natural stuff,” he 
said.
Phillips said he worries 
about what will happen if 
local farmers were unable to 
compete with corporations.
“[Local farmers] gon’ do 
pretty much what’s right for 
the people,” Phillips said.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, AUGUST 28, 2014

WHERE IT IS LEGAL.
RACHEL CROSBY
Alligator Staff Writer
rcrosby@alligator.org
As Florida voters face an 
amendment that could legalize 
medical marijuana this Novem-ber, a study suggests it could lower rates of painkiller abuse.
The research found that 
deaths associated with opi-ate abuse fell in 13 states after they legalized medical use of marijuana, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Associa-tion’s Internal Medicine.
The ﬁ  ndings were shared 
just days after the federal gov-ernment announced it was ﬁ  nal-izing new restrictions on drugs that contain hydrocodone, a highly addictive painkiller and now the most-prescribed drug.
“Yes, opioid overdoses are 
a national problem,” said Dr. Scott Teitelbaum, a UF psychia-
try professor and medical direc-
tor of the Florida Recovery Cen-ter, a rehab clinic at UF Health. “They don’t heal a wound. They change the brain’s percep-tion of pain. But is the solution pot? I don’t think so.”
Teitelbaum said the study 
shows a correlation between the 
decline in opioid-related over-
doses and medical marijuana, but it does not prove medical marijuana legalization caused the decline. There are many fac-tors that weren’t considered in the study, he said, like when the medical marijuana laws were implemented in each state and whether the decline could be 
attributed to the use of opioid 
blockers, which treat addiction.
“This is kind of jumping 
from A to Z,” Teitelbaum said.
In Florida, prescription 
drugs are present in more drug-related deaths than illegal sub-stances are, according to Florida Department of Law Enforce-
ment records, but it said drugs 
are not limited to opioids.
State records show opioid-
related deaths decreased be-tween 2011 and 2012, according to the most recent report avail-able. Records also showed that marijuana was one of the most commonly present substances 
in drug-related deaths, but it 
never was the cause of deaths.
But research on marijuana at 
UF is still up in the air.
Even if medical marijuana 
is legalized in Florida this No-
vember, UF spokeswoman Ja-
nine Sikes said the university cannot conduct medical mari-juana research because UF re-lies heavily on federal funding, and the drug is still illegal in the federal realm.
Per federal law, Sikes said 
the university can apply for permits to conduct medical marijuana research but cannot grow or cultivate the plant.
“I am aware of at least one 
researcher who plans to con-duct research on medical mari-juana at some point in the fu-ture,” Sikes wrote in an email. “We have conducted research on other regulated drugs in the past. These researchers must comply with federal regula-
tions about how that is done.”Marijuana might 
reduce painkiller abuse, study says

TAMPA — A 911 dispatcher is 
in trouble over his response to a 
mother who called for help after 
her 10-month-old son acciden-
tally locked himself in her car, police said.
Shana Dees said she put her 
son Jack in his car seat Saturday afternoon, and when she went to move a shopping cart, Jack hit the lock button on the keychain remote, The Tampa Tribune re-
ported. 
She called 911 because it was 
hot inside the car and said she 
was shocked by the dispatcher’s 
response.
“We won’t be able to try and 
gain access to the car unless the child is in some kind of distress,” 
Dees said the dispatcher told her. 
“And by that point, they may just 
smash your windows.”
And then he hung up.Tampa police spokeswoman 
Laura McElroy said the depart-ment’s protocol regarding a child locked in a car is to always send an ofﬁ  cer and ﬁ  re rescue to the scene. 
The dispatcher didn’t even ask 
the location of the vehicle.
McElroy said disciplinary ac-
tion could range from a written reprimand to a suspension.
An off-duty police ofﬁ  cer 
called 911 and spoke to a differ-ent dispatcher who sent help.
In the meantime, a nurse 
grabbed a wrench from the 
store’s utility closet and smashed 
the window. 
By then, Jack had been inside 
the car for 15 minutes. The nurse got the boy out and poured cool 
water over his head.
Dees said she and her hus-
band thanked the nurse, but they 
didn’t get his name.
“He acted when nobody else 
did, and we’re very grateful he did that,” she said.

engineering students at North Carolina State University. The underlying concept itself is simple, but also highly innovative. The students are designing nail polish that 
changes color when it comes into contact with common 
drugs used to facilitate sexual assault such as Rohypnol (rooﬁ  es), GHB and Xanax. The product is essentially an 
inconspicuous and convenient drink testkit.
Undercover Colors isn’t the ﬁ  rst product that’s been 
created to detect date rape drugs. Tumblers, coasters and other common drinkware have all been engineered to help 
their users avoid assault. But this is the ﬁ  rst that doesn’t need to be carried around with the user. 
Undercover Colors has emerged at a time when the dis-
graceful prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses is coming to national attention. The White House even or-
ganized a task force to deal with campus sexual assault in 
January. 
The panel found that one in ﬁ  ve college women will 
be sexually assaulted during their time as students. In the state of Florida, the number is one out of six: a modest improvement, but not nearly good enough.
In 2013, 107 instances of forcible rape were reported in 
Alachua County. Given that each individual act of rape is a horrendous and disgusting crime, this grim statistic 
shows that there is a lot of work to be done.
Undercover Colors isn’t perfect, and the product has 
encountered some valid criticism. Some anti-sexual as-sault advocates argue that the 
product places an undue burden 
on the potential victim. Rather 
than preventing sexual assault by controlling the behavior of 
would-be rapists, Undercover 
Colors is one of many seemingly inexhaustible solutions to sexual 
assault that require women to al-
ter their own behavior. 
Don’t walk alone at night. Don’t wear revealing clothes. 
Don’t accept drinks from guys—but if you do, paint this on your ﬁ  ngernails ﬁ  rst. As one feminist writer put it, “Personally avoiding sexual assault — or one particular, 
rather uncommon type of sexual assault — is not the same 
as preventing sexual assault.” 
There are other problems. As hinted in the quote above, 
drug-facilitated rapes make up an extremely small per-centage of rapes overall. Even then, the drug most com-monly used in these rapes is alcohol, which seems coun-
terintuitive given that the nail polish is meant primarily to 
test alcoholic drinks.
 In addition, pinning responsibility on the victim may 
actually lead to more victim blaming when sexual assault does occur. “This wouldn’t have happened if you were wearing Undercover Colors,” some will inevitably say. 
These issues are important to keep in mind, but these 
arguments will be fully valid only in theory until the ideo-logical framework that has allowed rape to pervade our 
society is dismantled. 
I agree with the criticisms of Undercover Colors. But I 
also realize that the problem of sexual assault and rape in our society is far from being resolved. 
There is still a terrifying number of men in this country 
harassing, assaulting and raping women.  And I support anything that might be able to stop them.

used the UF IT Help Desk in the Hub?Today’s question: Have you had to wait in line at the UF 
gyms this week?Rubio’s comments 
on immigration 
miss the mark
Florida’s junior senator, Marco Rubio, has been very vocal in 
recent weeks on the topic of immigration reform.
In a letter to President Barack Obama, Rubio said the 
president’s newly proposed executive actions on immigration would “close the door to any chance of making progress on im-
migration reform for the foreseeable future.”
Rubio is correct in saying the prospects for immigration re-
form are grim, but blaming that on Obama is simply ludicrous.
Obama’s actions on immigration to date can be classiﬁ  ed as 
moderate. The president has heavily stepped up both border se-
curity and deportation efforts during his administration.
The president’s new proposal, an expansion of the Deferred 
Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, would most-ly provide protections to undocumented immigrants who are 
making positive contributions to American society. DACA pri-
marily protects individuals who have no criminal records and have either enrolled in college or served in the armed forces.
Obama’s proposal is a well-reasoned response to the com-
plete failure of Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives to produce any sort of coherent or substantive reform bill.
In the House Republican caucus, ideas on immigration pol-
icy are inspired by such luminaries as Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa. Among other ignorant statements, King once said that for every 
undocumented immigrant who becomes a high school valedic-
torian, there are 100 with “calves the size of cantaloupes because they’re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.”
Despite King’s fearmongering, the reality is that the over-
whelming majority of undocumented immigrants have much more benevolent motivations.
These immigrants cross the border not to commit crimes or 
to sabotage the U.S. economy, but to build better lives for them-selves and their families. Many of these individuals come to this 
country ﬂ  eeing the murderous wrath of drug cartels, groups 
that the American-led “war on drugs” has helped to expand.
Even Speaker of the House John Boehner has acknowledged 
that Tea Party-aligned Republicans are the ones holding up the reform process. Asked about the Tea Party stance on immigra-tion reform, Boehner said this: “We get elected to make choices. We get elected to solve problems and it’s remarkable to me how many of my colleagues just don’t want to.”
Rubio deserves credit for his willingness to support the Sen-
ate’s immigration reform bill. Support from Senate Republicans is an important step toward resolution of this issue, which has serious implications for the social and economic well-being of the United States.
But if Rubio is truly interested in enacting comprehensive im-
migration reform, simply criticizing the president for proposing modest unilateral action is not acceptable.
Rubio must also call out his fellow Republicans for their re-
fusal to budge an inch from their hardline stance.
Until he does, Rubio will appear to be more of a political op-
portunist than someone truly dedicated to immigration reform.

At a whopping 97 degrees, 
Saturday was as seasonably and 
uncomfortably hot as ever. Yet thousands of people continued to pour into First Magnitude Brewing 
Company’s brewery barn, where 
beer and good company took pre-cedence over sweating.
After more than two years of 
planning, FM Brewery, 1220 SE Veitch St., opened its doors and served the public Saturday, enjoy-ing an opening more grand than expected.
“It was amazing. Better than we 
could have dreamed of, as cheesy as that sounds,” Meg The Losen, FM Brewery president, said.
The doors opened at 2 p.m., and 
just fifteen minutes later, The Los-en was getting texts from her team saying the parking lot was already full. Soon the line was out the door 
— and stayed that way throughout 
the day.  
Named after the powerful first 
magnitude springs of North Cen-tral Florida, FM Brewery started out as just an idea in March 2012, when four friends talked about opening a brewery together in Gainesville.
Head brewer and former as-
sociate director of the UF Honors program, John Denny, had been 
telling his students to follow their dreams for more than 13 years. 
Knowing he would live with re-gret if he didn’t follow his own, the beer aficionado took his own 
advice and moved forward with 
opening a brewery.
“It was as good of a start as I 
can imagine,” he said. “I’m very grateful for all the support.”
Throughout the opening week-
end, he and his partners, includ-ing his wife, Christine Denny, The Losen and her husband, Wells The 
Losen, sold about 3,000 beers, serv-
ing more than 1,500 people. They even ran out of a few of their spe-cialty beers.
FM Brewery has high hopes for 
the future, like selling to restau-rants and creating a beer garden with outdoor seating, live music and old-fashioned games like ring 
toss.
But even nearer is the excite-
ment of the first Gator game of the 
2014 football season, even though the brewery doesn’t have a great sense of what to expect.
“It will be a very different game 
than what I’m accustomed to,” John Denny said. “I hope people 
come and enjoy the game with 
us.”
The brewery will be open Satur-
day from 2 to 9 p.m., and it plans to have a large TV broadcasting the game.
Ameraucana Wood Fire food 
truck will serve food, the bar will be fully staffed and legal-sized growlers can be filled for custom-ers to take to tailgates. FM Brew-ery will also have  =its own labeled growlers.
“We’re hoping people can stop by for a pint,” Christine Denny said. “We’re excited and ready to pour.”

October marks UF’s Homecom-
ing, but a different kind of home-
coming — one of the punk-rock va-riety — starts this weekend at High Dive. 
The Gainesville-bred, ska-punk 
rockers of Less Than Jake will kick off their third annual Wake and Bake weekend, a two-day-long festi-val that attracts fans from as close as UF to as far as England. 
Wake and Bake, according to 
Alligator archives, began two years ago as an intimate gathering for Less 
Than Jake’s family, friends and local 
fans. 
The festival has grown consid-
erably in popularity since then, at-tracting super fans from around the world in addition to local music buffs who’ve followed the band’s immensely successful 22-year run. 
“Most of us went to college 
here — most of us failed out of col-lege here — but our roots are [in Gainesville],” drummer and lyricist Vinnie Fiorello said. 
“The ebb and flow of Gainesville 
is what keeps me [here]. You have freshmen and college kids com-ing in, bringing different ideas and tastes from where they come from. It’s a constant flow of ideas and mu-sic and head space.”
This year’s Wake and Bake 
weekend arrives at the end of a busy summer for the band, which spent 
the past few months playing across 
America with Vans Warped Tour. 
From Aug. 14 to 19, the band 
traveled to Russia to perform at the international music festival Kubana-2014. 
Fiorello said one major change in this year’s lineup is the bands they chose to have open for them. 
In the past, Wake and Bake has 
featured national bands, but this year the opening acts are all younger Florida-based groups.
“I’m excited about that,” Fiorello 
said. “Being able to support Florida music is important to Less Than Jake.”
Wake and Bake weekend begins 
Saturday at 1 p.m. with a tailgate at High Dive and bingo hosted by Less Than Jake frontman Chris De-Makes. 
Local food trucks will be on site, 
and the band is bringing back its legendary Less Than Jake yard sale, featuring old and new merch. 
On Sunday evening, fans who 
purchased the VIP bundle have the opportunity to perform live band karaoke with the members of Less Than Jake themselves. 
Doors for the Saturday night Less 
Than Jake performance open on Sat-urday night at 8 p.m. with guest openers Duppies, UNRB, Teen Ag-ers and Bill Perry Orchestra. 
On Sunday night, doors open at 
7 p.m. with guest openers Mighty Mongo, Chilled Monkey Brains and General Tso’s Fury. 
“Show up early; support the Flor-
ida music scene,” Fiorello said. “See 
some opening bands you might not have heard of, or heard of but never seen.”
Less Than 
Jake prides itself in not ditching 
Gainesville for the fast-paced Los Angeles music scene. 
It frequently pays homage to 
the city in both its discography and production — their most recent re-cord, last year’s “See the Light,” was written, recorded and produced in Gainesville. 
“They’re a band that really repre-
sents Gainesville’s music scene,” Pat Lavery, owner of local booking com-pany Glory Days Presents!, said. 
“They mix so many music 
styles… Gainesville is a melting pot, 
and their sound reflects that.”
“In Los Angeles, the music in-
dustry is a constant,” Fiorello said. 
“You have people that float in and 
out of that constant, but Gainesville 
has these waves of creativity that come in. It’s influenced my music and the way I look at the world.”
Tickets are $15 in advance or $17 
at the doors, available for presale either on Ticketweb.com or without 
fees at Hear It Again Music, the High 
Dive box office and High Tides. 
On Saturday from 1 to 6 p.m., 
there’s no cover. A $3 underage fee will be applied at the door, and showgoers younger than 18 must be accompanied by a parent or guard-ian.

“Another openin’, another 
show....” Awards season is 
back, and that means Tro-phy Hunting is, too — all the awards show coverage you 
need (without the hashtags). 
This year’s ﬁ  rst ceremony was the MTV Video Music Awards, aka the music in-dustry’s most notoriously naughty showcase. Known for its shock value, the 2014 edition showed promise early on with powerhouse per-
formances, divas galore and 
— you guessed it — endless amounts of twerking.
The show started off with 
a — brace yourselves — “Bang Bang” from Ariana Grande, Nicki Minaj and Jes-sie J. Grande and Minaj each sang clips of their current 
hits, “Break Free” and “Ana-
conda,” the latter bringing the booty in a major way with a gaggle of butt-popping, back-up dancers. Props to Minaj 
for handling the wardrobe-
malfunction-that-almost-was like a champ, too.
It was surely ladies night 
at the annual awards show. Katy Perry won the ﬁ  rst award of the night for Best Female Video. Perry also won the Best (intentional?) Imper-
sonation of Early Millennium 
Britney Spears Award for her head-to-toe denim garb.
Iggy Azalea and Rita Ora 
weaved their way around the stage for a stellar performance of “Black Widow,” while Mi-ley Cyrus made a statement by having her friend accept 
her award for Video of the 
Year on behalf of homeless and runaway youth in the U.S. Hey, it’s the VMAs.
The males of MTV also 
had their moments. Austra-lian pop sensation 5 Seconds of Summer went for a softer set with “Amnesia,” while Maroon 5 showcased “Maps” off of latest album “V.”
British rising star Sam 
Smith had an Adele moment while performing “Stay With 
Me.” Smith captivated the 
audience with his soaring vo-cals. Smith’s was one of the best and well-received perfor-mances of the night.
But no perfor-
mance, presenter or single being on earth could compare to Be-
yoncé, who closed the 
show with a 15-min-ute performance that included tracks from her self-titled visual album. The performance was way more than that. It was a true spectacle. Plus, baby Carter saying “Good job, 
mommy!” was the highlight 
of the night. After, Beyoncé was presented the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award from husband Jay-Z and daughter Blue Ivy.

Who says you can’t have 
an awards show on a Mon-
day night? Well, most people would say that — we’ve only just started the work week — 
but not the Academy of Mo-
tion Picture Arts and 
Sciences. The 66th Annual Emmys was your typical awards show fare with one discrepancy: the co-medic aspects of the night? They were 
the true shining moments. 
Host Seth Meyers deliv-
ered a knockout opening monologue, playfully poking fun at everything from MTV seizing hold of the Sunday night spot (the VMAs aired the night before) to calling television “the booty call 
friend of entertainment.” 
Another late-night host who threw down the comedy 
gauntlet was Jimmy Kim-mel. He called out Matthew 
McConaughey, who was 
nominated for “True Detec-tive,” for always seeming to be at award shows this year (“All right, all right, all right already!”).
The list of winners was 
less innovative. Outstand-ing Lead Actor and Actress 
in a Comedy Series went to 
“The Big Bang Theory’s” Jim Parsons and “Veep’s” Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
In a surprising turn of 
events, BBC favorite “Sher-lock” received some long-awaited Emmy recognition. The show stunned viewers by 
winning in several tough cat-
egories, including Outstand-ing Actor and Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Mini-series or Movie for Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman, respectively. In a more somber moment, 
Sara Bareilles performed a touching version of “Smile” during the in memoriam seg-ment. The beautiful tribute to Robin Williams that fol-lowed could possibly best be 
summed up by Billy Crystal’s 
parting words on his friend: “Robin Williams. What a con-cept.”
“Breaking Bad” closed out 
its Emmy contention with awards for Bryan Cranston, Aaron Paul and Anna Gunn for Outstanding Lead Actor, 
Supporting Actor and Sup-
porting Actress in a Drama Series respectively.
“Breaking Bad” took home 
one of the night’s top honors: Outstanding Drama Series. This wasn’t an unusual win, but would anyone protest against Walter White ﬁ  nally 
getting a happy ending?
Did your favorites win? Or 
were they unjustly snubbed?

We’ve made it people. The 2014 
college football season kicks off to-
night. With the season finally here, I give you the best matchups of the weekend from the Southeastern Con-
ference.  
No. 21 Texas A&M vs. No. 9 
South Carolina - 6 p.m. Tonight, 
SEC Network: The 2014 college foot-
ball season starts off with a bang as the No. 21 Aggies travel to Columbia, S.C. to face the No. 9 Gamecocks. The Gamecocks are 7-0 in Thursday-night season openers since Steve Spurrier 
took over in 2005.
With no more Johnny Football, 
the Aggies will start sophomore 
Kenny Hill at quarterback tonight. He should feel comfortable standing behind an offensive line that returns five starters from last season. 
The Aggies wide receiving corps 
is without Mike Evans this year, but senior Malcome Kennedy returns as their second-leading receiver from 2013, and they add true freshman stud Speedy Noil, who stepped on campus as the No. 3 ranked receiver in the 2014 recruiting class. 
Leading rusher Ben Malena is 
gone, but the ground game is led by Trey Williams and Tra Carson, who combined for over 700 yards rushing last year.
Luckily for Hill, Jadeveon 
Clowney, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2014 NFL Draft, is no longer in a JONATHAN CZUPRYN
Alligator Staff Writer @jczupryn
With Jeff Driskel returning from a broken fibula to play in 
Kurt Roper’s new high-tempo spread offense — and not to 
mention the hoopla surrounding the backup battle between Treon Harris and Will Grier — much of the attention sur-rounding Florida’s offense has been directed to the quarter-back position.
However, the Gators have quietly stacked a crowded and 
talented backfield during the offseason to potentially give coach Will Muschamp his most potent offense since he ar-rived in Gainesville in 2011.
And although a five-deep lineup at run-
ning back may seem like overkill head-ing into Saturday’s matchup with Idaho, Roper believes UF can use all the help it can get after the Gators ranked 13th in the Southeastern Conference in rushing yards per game (145.8).
“I don’t think you can ever have enough 
numbers there,” Roper said. “I really don’t. 
I think that’s a physical position that is hard to stay healthy. I’m glad we’ve got a bunch of guys.”
One of the tailbacks that had a difficult time staying on the 
field was Matt Jones, who played just five games in 2013 after a viral infection and a torn ACL caused him to be sidelined.
But now a fully healthy Jones coupled with a more expe-
rienced Kelvin Taylor gives Muschamp the one-two punch out of the backfield that he envisioned when he recruited the duo years ago.
Taylor went as far to say that he and his self-proclaimed 
“bigger brother” have the potential to accomplish a feat nev-er seen in UF history: have two running backs record 1,000 rushing yards in a single season.
“I mean, this year . . . both of us could go for 1,000 yards,” 
Taylor said. “We just got to keep working hard and I feel like me and Matt can do that, yes.”
Mike Gillislee was Florida’s last 1,000-yard rusher in 2012, 
but Jones — a freshman at the time — only accrued 275 yards on 52 attempts as the Gators’ No. 2 running back.The duo’s goal of 1,000 yards each seems even more 
daunting with Mack Brown still in the mix as well as Bran-
don Powell and Adam Lane. 
Although a deep backfield may hinder Taylor and Jones’ 
personal achievements on the field, the rotation should give 
the offense as a whole a boost with more fresh legs and more targets in the passing game.
“Coach (Roper) is always talking about getting guys out 
in the open field,” Taylor said. “We’ve got some players out 
at receiver, but the backs in this offense are definitely going 
to catch the ball. That’s why we stay after practice and do JUGGS and all different kinds of things.”

After redshirt senior Jonotthan Harrison 
played his last game for Florida — a 37-7 loss 
to Florida State on Nov. 30 at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium to close out a 4-8 season — coach Will Muschamp knew he needed a replacement.
Harrison started 37 games in the middle of 
the offensive line over his final three years at UF and was the only player on Florida’s roster in 2013 with starting center experience at the collegiate level.
Muschamp listed five criteria that he looked 
for in finding his new starting center once spring practice began.
“You need somebody that’s really smart, 
somebody’s that very decisive in their decision-making,” Muschamp said. “They need to be able to make a call, have confidence in the call and they need to be right. Then they need to be able to snap the ball.”
He thought of nobody better for the spot than Max Garcia.
“I didn’t know about the snapping, but 
those first four, there’s no question he was the 
right guy for the job,” Muschamp said of Gar-
cia, who started at left guard and left tackle in 2013, his first season playing for Florida after transferring from Maryland. “He’s very deci-sive in his decision-making. He is off-the-charts intelligent and a guy that has really done a nice job through camp snapping it.”
Garcia struggled with getting a clean snap 
during the first practices in spring, but his abil-
ity has improved as of late.
“Having a good snap is kind of an under-
rated thing in our offense,” quarterback Jeff 
Driskel said. “If the snap’s off, it throws off the timing. He understands that, so he did put in the work as far as snapping the ball. As far as getting the offensive line on the same page, he’s second to none.”
Added Garcia: “In the spring, I struggled, Garcia improving at center

Georgia running back Todd Gurley stiff arms a UF defender during the Bulldogs’ 23-20 win over the 
Gators on Nov. 2. Gurley is an early candidate for the Heisman trophy.
Gurley leads a packed UGA backfield heading into 2014
Gamecocks uniform. But South 
Carolina does return a solid line-backer corps this year led by Skai Moore, who had 56 tackles last year as a true freshman. They also return two starters in the secondary to challenge TAMU’s receivers.
Like Texas A&M, South Caro-lina is breaking in a new quar-terback. Fifth-year senior Dylan Thompson takes over for Connor Shaw with some good experience under his belt — he’s 3-0 as a starter in his career. Wideouts Shaq Roland and 
Damiere Byrd return as well, av-eraging 18 and 17 yards per catch last season, respectively.
Thompson is fortunate to have 
sleeper Heisman candidate Mike 
Davis in his backfield. The junior 
is coming off of a 1,183 yard rush-ing season, and f the Aggies can’t stop Davis, it could be a long night. 
A&M returns seven starters 
from a defense that ranked 96th or worse in rushing, passing, scoring and total defense.
Boise State vs. No. 18 Ole 
Miss - 8 p.m. Tonight, ESPN: We 
get two kickoff treats tonight as BCS buster Boise State plays No. 18 Ole Miss in Atlanta. Boise’s last trip to the Georgia Dome in 2011 resulted in a 14-point vic-tory over Georgia. It gets tougher for Boise this time around, as they 
are without prolific passer Kellen 
Moore and head coach Chris Pe-tersen.
Ole Miss is entering its third 
year under Hugh Freeze. Return-ing with him is an extremely tal-ented defense led by defensive tackle Robert Nkemdiche and All-American safety Cody Prewitt. 
They return seven other starters 
from the unit. Offensively, they get quarterback Bo Wallace, who had more than 3,300 yards pass-ing last year, back. 
Sophomore wide receiver 
Laquon Treadwell will be his go-to target, averaging 8 yards per catch as a true freshman last year.
No. 16 Clemson vs. No. 12 
Georgia - Saturday 5:30 pm, ESPN: Georgia has revenge on its 
mind after suffering a 38-35 loss 
to Clemson in last year’s season opener. 
The ‘Dawgs have a new quar-
terback in fifth-year senior Hut-son Mason, who enters with two and a half games experience un-der his belt. Mason has a plethora of talented wideouts to throw to 
including Chris Conley, Michael 
Bennett and Malcolm Mitchell. 
Georgia’s backfield is loaded 
with tailbacks Todd Gurley and Keith Marshall, too. Heisman candidate Gurley rushed for more than 900 yards last year de-spite being banged up for a good chunk of the season. 
Marshall is fully recovered 
from a season ending ACL tear in 2013.
Clemson is without the dy-
namic duo of Sammy Watkins and Tajh Boyd on offense, but their defense returns six starters including defensive end Vic Bea-sley who racked up 13 sacks last 
season. The Tigers’ defensive line 
could exploit an inexperienced Georgia offensive line, who re-turns just one lineman who start-ed all 13 games last season.

Middle linebacker refers to UF offensive line as ‘nasty’
but now it’s gotten to a point where at some 
practices, I don’t have any bad snaps. So, I’ve just been really focusing on that, and you can see the development.”
Garcia will be the focal point of an offen-
sive line that linebacker Mike Taylor described as “nasty” throughout practice.
“They’re finishing blocks up front, opening 
holes for the running back,” the redshirt senior said. “I don’t know if it’s because of the scheme that they’re running but I know that they’ve brought a new intensity with how they block and how they approach the game.”
Junior D.J. Humphries and redshirt senior 
Chaz Green will take the left and right tackle positions, respectively, while Trip Thurman will start at left guard and either Trenton Brown and Tyler Moore will start at right guard.While his spot in the starting lineup hasn’t 
been solidified, Brown — a 6-foot-8, 360-pound senior from Albany, Ga. — is someone that Garcia is grateful to have on his side on game day.
“Trent makes me look so small when I’m 
standing next to him,” Garcia said. “But I like having him there. No one’s going to get 
through him. No one’s gonna bull rush Tren-
ton Brown. That’s just not happening. And when he puts his hand on someone, that guy’s getting moved against his will. 
“He doesn’t want to get moved, but he’s 
going to get moved. So having him there, he’s a force.”
Injuries plagued the offensive line in 2013, 
forcing the Gators to use seven different start-ing lineup formations throughout the season.
“We were beat up at times last year,” 
Driskel said. 
“Guys were asked to go either inside to 
outside or outside to inside, which is tough. 
But at the same time, you’ve got to have depth 
and you’ve got to be able to rely on more than five guys. I think we have started to build some depth. I think our offensive line works well together, and we have a lot of talent at the position.”

Alex Holston swings at the ball during Florida’s 3-0 win against Ten-
nessee on Oct. 27 in the O’Connell Center.

 Last season, she was the fresh-
man phenom that was nervous 
about seeing her name in the start-
ing line up.
This season, she’s just ready to 
get on the court and play.
Right-side hitter Alex Holston, 
one of Florida’s biggest recruits in 2013, showed Florida fans, team-
mates and coaches exactly why 
she was ranked No. 9 by PrepVol-
leyball’s Senior Aces list.
With a list of accolades includ-
ing  AVCA All-Region, South-
eastern Conference-All Freshman 
Team and All-SEC Team, Hol-
ston set the bar high for incoming 
freshmen.
But with her ﬁ  rst season in the record books, Holston is looking 
to improve on her rookie year.
“From a successful freshman 
season, I always want to do better 
and take a step up,’ Holston said.
The Olney, Md., native came to 
Florida as the school’s ﬁ  rst top-10 recruit since 2008 when three-time 
All-American and current USA 
national team member Kelly Mur-phy joined the team.
Holston passed up offers from 
46 other schools not knowing if 
she would even make the starting 
lineup.
“Last year I was really ner-
vous, I didn’t know I was going to play,” Holston said. “I was just 
happy to be here and happy to be 
practicing with the Florida team.”
When it was time to announce 
the lineup for the season opener against New Orleans on Aug. 30, 
2013, Holston couldn’t believe her 
eyes.
“When she (Mary Wise) an-
nounces the starters it’s literally right before the game, so you real-
ly don’t know if you’re playing,” 
Holston said. 
“Last year, my heart was beat-
ing so fast when I saw my number on the board. I just didn’t know 
what to do.”
Despite her nerves, Holston 
completed her ﬁ  rst season open-
ing weekend against New Or-
leans and LIU-Brooklyn with 14 
kills on a .393 offensive clip and 
six blocks.
At the end of the season, she 
started 18 matches, making 55 blocks and 286 kills — which were 
both third on the team.
With her nerves in check, Hol-
ston reiterates her original mes-
sage: she’s just ready to play.
“We’re all just excited to get 
out there and play, like every 
team,” she said. 
“We always want to play tough 
teams, we never want to go in and just have a day off. We know that 
no teams is like having a day off 
though.”Right-side hitter strives for success

 When fans go to soccer 
games and watch them on 
television, they are anticipat-
ing the exciting moments of 
the game. 
They want to see goals, 
and they want to see the big 
plays. 
For this year’s Florida 
team, fans can expect plenty 
of goals and exciting scoring plays with offensive power-
houses such as Savannah Jor-
dan and Jillian Graff.
But what gets overlooked 
at times when a team wins 
is how well its defense per-
forms.
The No. 6 Gators won 
their ﬁ  rst two games this past weekend, shutting out both 
Miami and South Florida 
and holding them to a com-bined ﬁ  ve shots compared to Florida’s 29. 
The defensive play of 
Florida was solid through-out both games, and not just from the defenders, but from everybody on the ﬁ  eld.
“This preseason we really 
worked on team defense,” senior midﬁ  elder Havana Solaun said. “The whole con-
cept is kind of like when we 
lose possession, it’s get be-hind the ball and whoever’s closest goes and so I think that everybody all over the 
ﬁ  eld was just doing a huge job of playing team de-
fense.”
Senior goalkeeper Tay-
lor Burke also liked what 
she saw from her defense 
last weekend. She had high praise for the way her team played defensively in both 
games.
“We didn’t even have that 
many shots on goal,” Burke 
said, “so it was awesome that the whole team defended 
and it was really good for us 
to get two shutouts as well.”
Although she was quick 
to give credit to her defense 
for the two shutout victories, 
Burke’s play this weekend can not be overlooked ei-ther. 
She is no stranger to shut-
outs as she captured the 24th and 25th solo shutouts of her career with the wins over Miami and South Florida 
and is now only two away 
from tying the school record of 27, which was set by Katie Fraine in 2010.
Not everything Burke 
does during a game gets rec-ognized on the stat sheet, but it is reﬂ  ected in the team’s 
performance as a whole.
“She takes care of a lot 
of things by directing the 
people in front of her,” coach 
Becky Burleigh said, “and 
by cutting out crosses and things like that that could turn into more dangerous opportunities.”Goalkeeper, defense
