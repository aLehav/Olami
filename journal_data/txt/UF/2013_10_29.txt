� COUNTY OFFICIALS COLLECTED ABOUT 200 
GALLONS OF OIL FROM THE FAIR. 
PATRICIA POTESTADES
Alligator Contributing Writer
The leftover cooking oil from those fried Oreos and Twinkies 
at the Alachua County Fair last week will likely end up fueling 
a truck or electrical generator. 
As part of the Alachua County’s waste vegetable oil recy-
cling program, county ofﬁ  cials collected about 200 gallons of 
oil from the fair, said John J. Mousa, county pollution preven-
tion manager. Under Florida law, food vendors are required to properly 
dispose their oil after use. After ofﬁ  cials collect the oil, they mix it with methanol and a catalyst, which creates biodiesel, Mousa said. 
Stephen White, chief executive ofﬁ  cer of Event Marketing 
Corporation, the company that runs the fair, said the fair in-
dustry has always looked for a place to get rid of vegetable and 
motor oils. 
“(Alachua) County has been very progressive here,” he 
said. 
The county became interested in biodiesel after students 
from Oak Hall School contacted ofﬁ  cials for help on a recy-cling project. It pursued the project on a larger scale in 2010 but had to stop in December because of complications with state tax laws and biodiesel production. In July, the county came up with a solution with state legislators and was able to restart production. 
Since the program began, Mousa said the county has col-
lected enough vegetable oil to produce about 3,000 gallons of biodiesel. Instead of ending up as sewage spills in local creeks, Mousa said the energy in the oil is being put to better use. 
“The worst thing you can do is pour it down the sink,” he 
said.Cooking oil from Alachua County fair to be recycled as biodieselSEE FRATERNITY, PAGE 4

A distinguished UF 
chemistry professor is com-
bining music and science with the release of his ﬁ  rst 
solo album, “Genius Boy 
Music.”
Charles “Chuck” Martin 
calls his new album “funk-ﬁ  lled” with “some blue-eyed soul” through his Twitter page. There will be an album release show Nov. 22 in downtown Gainesville at Loosey’s, a bar specializ-ing in live music.
On his YouTube channel, 
he has garnered hundreds of views on his videos, in-cluding a song “Me & Stel-la,” which is about his cat and is included on the new album.
O u t 
of the 12 songs fea-
tured, two 
are writ-
ten about and dedi-cated to 
his black-and-white domes-tic longhair feline.
“Stella is like the daugh-
ter I never had,” he said.
Martin has released 
four other albums with the bands “dblWiDE” and “The Righteous Kind,” which were rock ’n’ roll and rock-abilly bands, but this is his ﬁ  rst venture into writing, producing and recording a solo album.UF professor

In an email sent to all UF so-
rorities and fraternities Monday, 
UF President Bernie Machen con-
demned the behavior of an Alpha 
Tau Omega brother who shouted racial and sexist slurs at a black 
woman on Sept. 26. 
“I am disappointed and 
ashamed that members of an or-
ganization aimed at creating the 
leaders of tomorrow exhibited this 
kind of ignorance, hateful behavior and complacency,” Machen wrote 
about the confrontation.
The woman, who declined to 
comment and asked to remain 
anonymous, reported the incident 
to the Dean of Students’ Ofﬁ  ce on 
Sept. 27. Jen Day Shaw, associate vice 
president and dean of students, said the ofﬁ  ce investigated the situ-
ation to see if any laws were bro-
ken or violations were made to the student code of conduct. The ofﬁ  ce found no crime had 
been committed and did not ﬁ  le a 
report with police. 
“There’s no violation of the law 
here,” Shaw said. “It’s not a hate 
crime, it’s a bias incident.”
After ﬁ  nding out about the 
incident from a faculty member who wrote about it in an email list-serv, Machen decided to address UF fraternity apologizes after Machen’s reprimand

� IT SURVEYED ADULTS 
FROM AGES 18 TO 24.  
LAWRENCE CHAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
People are too reliant on 
their gizmos, and young adults 
believe it’s dehumanizing their interactions. 
A recent study released by 
Intel Corporation surveyed about 12,000 adults between the ages of 18 and 24 and found more than half felt society re-lied heavily on technology and made people less human. 
Genevieve Bell, an anthro-
pologist and director of Interac-tion and Experience Research 
at Intel Labs, said although the 
results might make it seem like young adults are rejecting tech-nology, the reality is more com-
plicated. 
“A different way to read 
this might be that millennials 
want technology to do more for them,” she said in a state-ment, “and we have work to do to make it much more personal and less burdensome.”
Adam Worner, a 19-year-old 
UF anthropology sophomore, said online conversations with friends often feel less personal than talking to them in person. 
“You start getting used to 
talking to people through a screen,” he said. “You can’t get a heartfelt conversation that way.”
UF electrical engineering 
junior Russell Crowe, 20, dis-agreed.
“It doesn’t seem that way to 
me,” he said.Study: Technology is

Six people in an environmental-
ist group received trespass warn-
ings after attempting to enter the McKnight Brain Institute.
A group of organizers for the 
Campaign to Stop Genetically En-gineered Trees, an initiative by the Global Justice Ecology Project, said they were trying to see Saturday the room where they would host their presentation, despite being told Thursday presentation had been canceled. The group was scheduled to present Monday night at the insti-
tute.
Police found six people trying to 
enter the locked building, according 
to accounts in the University Police’s incident report. One UF student was among the six: 28-year-old William Brandon Jones said he tried using his Gator 1 card to get inside the build-ing because he had reserved a room 
for the presentation. Jones could not 
be reached for comment.
Witnesses called police after they 
saw the group trying to catch doors before they closed behind personnel and even had one member of the group, Rachel Kijewski, ask about entering the building to get a back-pack, according to the report.
“(UPD) were rather confronta-
tional,” said Kijewski, an organizer with Everglades Earth First! “It wasn’t clear what was going on.”
Jones was trespassed from the 
Health Science Center, and the rest of the group was issued trespass warnings for all UF properties. The warnings stand for three years.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes 
said the event was canceled because free space is only offered to regis-tered UF-sponsored organizations.  A Global Justice Ecology organiza-
tion is not registered at UF.
“They were very deceptive,” 
Sikes said.She said Jones, who was corre-
sponding with the director of the in-
stitute, was notiﬁ  ed the meeting had been canceled. A room in the build-ing was reserved by Jones on Sept. 30, according to emails obtained by the Alligator.
A UF-led research team received 
a $6.3 million grant in 2011 to ge-
netically enhance the chemical re-
sponsible for creating the scent of Christmas trees to make transporta-tion biofuels, according to Alligator archives.
Will Bennington, one of the six 
who trespassed Saturday, said he thinks the event was canceled for political reasons.
“It seems kind of unlikely that 
the room is mysteriously closed for repairs,” the campaigner with the Global Justice Ecology Project said. “It’s pretty likely they’re trying to silence our opinion.”
The group presented at the Civic 
Media Center in Gainesville on Sun-day. As of Monday, it planned to 
continue its scheduled presentation 
at a member’s house.

UF Health Shands Hospital and Flad Architects came 
together Monday to carve up some fun.
The 31st annual Pumpkin Carve-Off was held in the 
UF Health Shands Atrium on Archer Road to bring Hal-
loween spirit to the children in the pediatric department. 
Nine teams and 21 individual competitors participated. 
Tim Williams, a representative for Flad Architects, said 
this year’s contest brought Flad closer to Shands’ pediatric 
department.
“Prior to this year it was architects, engineers, contrac-
tors and everybody on the construction side,” he said. “This year, we’ve opened entrance to the community as well as Shands patients and staff.”
The children, staff and volunteers at the event were en-thusiastic about the pumpkins, games and candy. There were six winning categories and three honorable men-tions. The pulmonary medicine team, whose pumpkin was complete with a carved rib cage, wolf head and func-tioning false lungs, won best in show. The winning team brought home gift cards to Dunkin’ Donuts, Starbucks 
and Panera Bread.
Christina Eagan, a nurse at UF and member of the pul-
monary medicine team, said she was excited about the 
win.
“It feels awesome, and it was lots of fun to do,” she 
said. 4, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2013
� NO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT FROM THE SPILL 
WAS REPORTED.

Gainesville Police are investigating an oil spill that forced 
city officials to close a portion of Southwest Second Avenue 
in the southwest portion of Gainesville’s Innovation District 
for more than four hours Saturday.
Spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said Monday the depart-
ment could not say how it happened. 
At about 9 a.m. Saturday, GPD officers responded to a re-
port of an oil spill in the area between the 600 and 1000 block of Southwest Second Avenue. Officers closed the road while officials from the Gainesville Fire Rescue Hazardous Materi-als Response Team attempted to clean the oil off the street.
Because of the “magnitude of the spill,” Tobias said, fire 
rescue officials used dump trucks filled with sand to remove the oil. By 2 p.m., officials cleaned up the oil and reopened the road for traffic and pedestrians. The spill was not big enough for state environmental agencies to get involved. 
“No impact to the environment from the spill was report-
ed,” said Mara Burger, a public information specialist for the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. 
Burger said oil spills, especially those that happen in Flor-
ida, should be taken seriously in every circumstance. One 
reason, she said, is because the state has shallow aquifers, 
which is easy for oil to seep into.  Most oil spills in cities, she 
added, are caused by vehicle accidents. 
“We don’t want the storm drains to be filled with oil, and 
we don’t want fuel to get into our water systems,” she said. 
“Any spills that can seep into the ground or our water sup-
ply can end up being dangerous.”Oil spill closed part

A 33-year-old Gainesville man 
landed behind bars Sunday after-
noon after he stole a $15 pair of head-phones from the Butler Plaza Wal-Mart and resisted arrest, police said.
Gainesville Police officers arrested 
Lamont Xavier Ferguson on charges of robbery and petit theft, according to a GPD arrest report.
At about 10:45 a.m., a Butler Plaza 
Wal-Mart loss prevention officer saw Ferguson take a pair of Sony head-phones, hide them in his pants and walk out of the 
store, according to the report.
The store of-
ficer tried to stop Ferguson, but Fer-guson fought back 
to the point where 
a bystander had to help hold him 
down until GPD officers arrived. During the fight, one official was in-jured. Officers later arrested Ferguson. However, they were not able to 
find the headphones. 
During questioning, Ferguson 
told police he took the earbuds off the shelf to look at them and put them back, according to the report. He added that he was slammed against a wall by the loss prevention 
staff on his way out.
Officers booked Ferguson into the 
Alachua County Jail at about 1 p.m. 
Sunday. He remained in jail Monday in lieu of no bond.Gainesville man hides Wal-Mart

UF’s chapter of Alpha Tau Omega received a letter from UF President 
Bernie Machen about an incident in front of the fraternity house.
“Prior to this year it was architects,

entrance to the community as well as 
Shands patients and staff.”

“Each album I’ve made has gotten better,” Martin said.
He described “Genius Boy Music” as eclectic with 
sounds of rock, jazz, blues and R&B. James Brown, John Lennon, Marvin Gaye, Lou Reed and Frank Zappa are mu-
sical inspirations and he said he tries to mix an array of 
influences to make a unique sound.
The album features 15 guest artists who are local 
Gainesville musicians, including performance artist and 
the Rev. Tom Miller, who plays the bass on most of the 
tracks.
“Chuck’s a prankster and we have a lot of fun,” Miller 
said. “He’s got a thing for his cat. I don’t know what’s go-
ing on there.”
They met playing in “The Righteous Kind” together, and 
he was asked to play bass for Martin’s album. Miller said the strength of the album is that it’s incredibly diverse.
“Chuck Martin is kind of like Gainesville’s ‘Buckaroo 
Banzai,’” he said.   
Martin also wrote a song dedicated to his freshman 
chemistry students: “When you take chemistry/ you’ve got to study every day/ but chem’s so groovy/ you’re go-
ing to want to anyway.”
Reuters listed Martin as one of the world’s top 100 influ-
ential chemists in 2011.
“I’m the only person to have won international awards 
in songwriting and research,” he said.
Always playing new material for his wife, he calls her 
the “ultimate truth test” for her honest reactions to his mu-
sic.
“Musicians should always grow,” Martin said. “When 
you rest on your laurels, you’re dead.”It features 15 guestsThe fraternity will not be formally charged
the Greek community and express 
his disapproval with the fraternity brother’s behavior. 
“President Machen was told 
about the situation and obviously was disgusted by what happened,” Shaw said. “When something like 
this happens, it personally makes 
him angry.”
In response to the incident, rep-
resentatives from the Multicultural and Diversity Affairs and Sorority and Fraternity Affairs held a man-
datory educational workshop with 
the fraternity. The meeting focused on the history of racial and sexual slurs and their consequences.
“When freedom of speech is part 
of the equation, always use more free speech to combat it,” Shaw said.
Wynn Smiley, Chief Executive 
Officer of the ATO National Fra-
ternity, said the chapter will not be 
punished because it was “not in-volved in the event.”
“This was an individual action,” 
he said. “The chapter dealt effec-tively with the member who said the insults, and the chapter worked with the university and with ATO in investigating the incident and on 
apologizing on behalf of the mem-
ber.”
Smiley said the brother remains 
suspended from participating in fra-
ternity events since the incident. 
Albie Kaminsky, a 22-year-old 
UF finance senior and president 
of the Interfraternity Council, said the council will monitor and check 
in with the fraternity to make sure 
a similar incident “doesn’t happen again.”
“There was nothing in our con-
stitution or our bylaws to formally charge the organization,” he said. “However, we did recognize it as a serious offense and something that needs to be seriously addressed.”
On Monday, the fraternity sent 
an apology letter through the Greek email listserv.
“There is no excuse or explana-
tion for this behavior, and it does not reflect the ideals or principles of our brotherhood,” the fraternity wrote. “We recognize that while only one of our members was involved, this 
incident reflects poorly on our entire 
fraternity.”FRATERNITY , from page 1

The Florida Cicerones, the of-

The Cicerones host Fall and 
Spring forums during the year. 
Dobler said he expects the Fall 
forum to attract a few hundred students.
Melissa Mendez, a 22-year-old 
UF management graduate student and the Cicerones recruitment co-chair, said she choreographed the performance to get students excited about the Fall forum.
“It’s the ﬁ  rst time we invite potential new members to our home,” she said.
The forum will give interested 
students a chance to meet cur-rent members of the organization while moving through different rooms in Emerson.

The Challenge Course and 
Alpine Tower program at Lake 
Wauburg’s South Shore is 
reaching new heights.
Students can expect an 
added zip line, power pole and 
higher levels to the pre-existing 
low elements challenge course.
The installation process to 
add the high elements chal-
lenge is scheduled to begin next week, and the completed 
course will be open to students 
in January.
The new course will give 
students obstacles on each of the three levels. Two zip lines and two power poles will be 
added. The gravity zip lines 
will run about 225 feet and the power pole will be 40 feet high. The power pole, or leap of faith, 
is where students climb to the 
top of a pole, leap out and try to grab a trapeze or ring a bell.
“I love feeling that adrena-
line rush, and there’s not much in Gainesville that can really give you that feeling, so jump-ing off a tower or doing the zip 
line could be really fun with a group of friends,” said Jileen 
Bray, a 21-year-old UF public relations junior.
Site preparation for con-
struction has already begun, and soon, Challenge Design In-novations will start the installa-
tion process. The company has 
been working on prefabricating pieces before arriving at Lake Wauburg.
Coordinator of Outdoor 
Parks and Recreation Michelle Alexander said David Bowles, the director of the Department of Recreational Sports, is very 
progressive. Bowles looks at 
the trends in the industry and tries to ﬁ  gure out ways to en-hance the program.
“When Student Government 
had some money available, this was one of those things they de-cided to fund,” Alexander said.
The course will be free to 
UF student organizations by appointment on the weekends. Paid reservations for weekday appointments will be open to non-UF organizations and pri-
vate companies.
“I think it’s going to be a 
super opportunity and a lot of 
fun,” Alexander said. “If you 
have not done a ropes course, 
you need to come out and visit us.”Lake Wauberg to

A goodbye to Lou Reed
There’s an often-repeated quip about the Velvet Under-
ground: Only about 30,000 people bought the band’s debut album, but they all went out and started a band 
after hearing it. 
“No songwriter to emerge after Bob Dylan so radically 
expanded the territory of rock lyrics. And no band did more than the Velvet Underground to open rock music to experi-mental theater, art, literature and ﬁ  lm, to William Burroughs and Andy Warhol, Reed’s early patron,” wrote Dave Urban-ski for The Blaze. “Indie rock essentially begins in the 1960s with Reed and the Velvets; the punk, New Wave and alter-native rock movements of the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s were all indebted to Reed, whose songs were covered by R.E.M., Nir-vana, Patti Smith and countless others.”
Reed, who died this weekend at the age of 71 — likely 
from complications due to a liver transplant he underwent in May — is survived by his legacy of superior songwriting. 
“An outlaw in his early years, Reed would eventually per-
form at the White House, have his writing published in The New Yorker, be featured by PBS in an ‘American Masters’ documentary and win a Grammy in 1999 for Best Long Form Music Video,” Urbanski wrote. “The Velvet Underground was inducted into the Rock and Roll (Hall) of Fame in 1996 
and their landmark debut album, ‘The Velvet Underground 
& Nico,’ was added to the Library of Congress’ registry in 2006.”
The death of older rockers, especially ones as prominent 
and proliﬁ  c as Lou Reed, resonates with millennials and Gen Y-ers, who grew up steeped in the music of their ag-ing baby-boomer parents. Our generation has seen a cultural phenomenon unlike generations past: When baby boomers became parents, they eschewed the authoritarian parenting 
style of their parents and instead opted for a friendlier, more 
cooperative relationship with their children. Sharing music naturally follows in this new parenting trend. 
Given the success of courses at UF such as “History of 
Rock ‘N’ Roll,” it’s clear young adults have taken an inter-est in the music of artists and bands who are either long-deceased or long-disbanded. 
Lou Reed’s death, then, is a sad moment for all of us who 
grew up singing along to “Yellow Submarine” as toddlers, 
spending afternoons driving around listening to Led Zeppe-
lin as teens and eagerly purchasing the reissued editions of classic albums such as “Pet Sounds” and “Highway 61 Re-visited.”
In 1996, Reed wrote a guest column for The New Yorker 
titled “The Aches and Pains of Touring.” He closed the piece — a tour diary, of sorts — describing the mood before a show in Belgium: 
“Some group has threatened to kill the Sex Pistols for can-
celling a gig — security is high. What a way to go. Shot by a drunken fan mistaking you for Johnny Rotten. I love rock and roll.”

record label a good use of student money?Today’s question: Did you see Florida-Georgia Line in 
concert at UF?Stop and smell the roses, busy Gators
A good friend of mine carries home a new stack 
of books from the library every week. She reads all the time, maintains good grades and serves 
as an event director for one of her extracurriculars. One of my favorite things about her is that, no matter when I ask her to do something, she’s ready. I’ve never heard her say, “I can’t, I’m busy.” She has just as much to do as everyone else but makes time for the things she en-joys, like reading Jacques Lacan and taking photo ex-cursions. 
We could all afford to take a page from her book.At a university such as UF, we’re all accustomed to 
hectic schedules, but we’ve forgotten that they’re not a requirement. Busyness has become a status symbol. The New York Times article “The ‘Busy’ Trap” captures the essence of this epidemic perfectly, explaining how pro-moting our busyness builds an illusion of importance both to ourselves and those around us.
What are we Gators if not overachievers? We’re ad-
dicted to full planners and Google calendars brimming with to-do’s. We pencil in 45-minute coffee dates with old friends just to lament our chaotic lives. Being too busy — and talking about it — makes us feel important and in demand, as though we didn’t sign ourselves up for most of the items on our lists.
These busy-centric conversations consist of ques-
tions like “How have you been?” which are invari-ably answered with phrases like “crazy busy” and “so stressed.” Cue the battle of one-upping each other on workloads and number of social engagements until both parties sigh, shrug their shoulders and commence describing their level of fatigue. We want our listeners to pity and respect our busy selves all at once, a combi-nation not seen in any other situation, probably because those emotions are completely contradictory.
If we’re so busy — even with schedules packed with 
trivialities — we must be making progress, right? A list full of places to go and people to see makes our progress to-ward some abstract future just a little more tangible. We can see our success and so can ev-eryone else.
The Times piece also high-
lights the use of busyness “as a kind of existential reassurance, a hedge against emptiness.”
If we’re constantly in motion, our lives must be brim-
ming with meaning and purpose. Whether or not the activities we participate in fulﬁ  ll us, they certainly ﬁ  ll out a day planner, leaving no idle time to feel lonely or bored — or to enjoy life’s little pleasures. Busyness is our society’s newest defense mechanism against emo-tions that will ﬁ  nd us anyway.
We fall victim to the busy trap when we believe we 
can’t progress unless others can see our struggle too. Those of us who pad our daily schedules with ﬂ  uff ac-tivities should reevaluate how to spend our precious time. 
Most importantly, we have to stop perpetuating the 
idea that whoever is the busiest and most stressed will reap the biggest reward. 
That couldn’t be further from the truth.None of this busyness — whether real, feigned or ex-
aggerated — signals success. 
To put it simply, life is too short to be too busy for 
the wrong reasons. 
We must consider our motivations when signing up 
for that new club or taking on extra hours at work. 
Are our reasons for pleasure or a purpose, or might 
we realize we’re only trying to keep up with the prover-bial Joneses?

In 2008, then-candidate 
President Barack Obama was a tech pioneer. He 
utilized social media and the Internet to spread his mes-
sage of “Hope and Change” 
to millions of Americans. His Internet-money campaign was unbridled. Because of his many online successes, media outlets dubbed him the ﬁ  rst social-media president and the man who would usher the federal government into the 
21st century.  
Fast forward to 2013 and 
we see a different picture. The 
Internet-exchange website for Obama’s signature piece of legislation — the Afford-able Care Act — is an embar-rassing failure. Government technology, for the most part, 
remains primitive. The tech-
savvy campaigner and chief yet again failed to live up to his 2008 hype. 
There is a stark difference 
between private-sector candi-date Obama — who privately raised millions of dollars for his presidential campaign — 
and public-sector President 
Obama. 
Candidate Obama hired 
Internet wizards to run his on-line campaign. Techies such as Facebook’s co-founder Chris Hughes and the cam-paign’s digital director Teddy Goff were instrumental back 
in 2008.
When Obama used private 
money to fund his campaign, 
it was a success, but when President Obama used public money to set up his health-care exchange website, what resulted was far from a suc-cess. Only after the website 
was universally criticized for 
its glitches did the president consider calling in computer specialists to properly imple-ment it. Candidate Obama would never allow the web-site to fail so miserably during its rollout. 
But this should not surprise 
anyone. A big difference be-tween the public and private sector is accountability.   
Candidate Obama had to 
be accountable for his actions because his hopes of the presi-dency were on the line. But because he will remain in of-ﬁ  ce, such accountability is not 
taken into effect.
The private sector is held 
to higher standard than the 
public sector. Why? Well, in the private sector, every ac-tion that is or isn’t taken has a real consequence for the business. If a company fails to earn revenue, then that com-
pany is forced to make tough decisions for the sake of the 
business. If a marketing plan fails miserably, you can bet that action will be taken to ﬁ  x 
it. If employees do not do their 
jobs efﬁ  ciently and effectively, they will be ﬁ  red. The wellbe-ing of the business is always at risk. The company’s revenues are dependent on how well the business runs and turns out a proﬁ  t.    
Now take a look at the pub-
lic sector. Revenues are con-stant — they come from our taxes. Regardless if the gov-ernment does a good or bad job, it constantly receives rev-enue. Accountability, though, is not as constant. 
In the public sector, if a 
public program — for in-
stance, Medicare — adds 
countless dollars to an ever-increasing national debt, it expands and remains unre-formed. If a public-sector em-ployee — for example, IRS of-ﬁ  cial Lois Lerner — politically targets conservative-sounding groups, the employee does not get ﬁ  red. Or perhaps, if a department secretary fails at marketing a piece of legisla-
tion, wastes taxpayer money 
on a botched health exchange website and “doesn’t work for the people” who want her to be held accountable for her ac-tions — let’s say, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius — the sec-retary remains in ofﬁ  ce and 
doesn’t assume any responsi-
bility. 
This would be outrageous 
if it was not so tragic. The public sector — where policy initiatives go to die and where taxpayer dollars are misman-aged — remains hopelessly out of control despite the fact 
that the candidate of hope and 
change is in ofﬁ  ce. The tech-savvy president presides over an outdated government bu-reaucracy and a botched web-site for a piece of legislation 
that bears his name.    
What the public sector 
needs to do is to act more like 
the private sector. If only the country had the ability to vote for a businessman who under-stood the power of the private sector. If only.

In recent years, stories on rape have become increas-
ingly formulaic. We’re given the same statistics with absolutely no analysis of the cause of rape or real so-
lutions.
Recently, articles focusing on rape published by the 
Alligator contained the phrase “rape culture” in the title, which was repeatedly referenced and blamed without ever being deﬁ  ned. “Rape culture” is a culture that nor-malizes and allows rape in its society. Joking about rape, making excuses for rapists and street harassers, and scrutinizing a woman’s dress and behavior instead of the behavior of rapists and street harassers is rape cul-ture. These conditions certainly exist and are a form of sexism, but lumping them together as “rape culture” ig-
nores the cause of the problem. Men who rape women 
are the cause of the problem — not jokes or poor excus-es.
In its series of articles on rape, the Alligator suggest-
ed UF require incoming freshmen to take a workshop on consent because lack of consent determines rape. But the problem is not deﬁ  ning consent once and for all, as if some men do not know the difference between yes, no and unconscious. The problem is men who are rap-
ists do not hear or respect a woman when she gives any 
answer they do not want to hear. The problem is these men know how very unlikely it is that they will ever be accused of rape, let alone prosecuted and charged.
National Women’s Liberation believes that the fre-
quency and threat of rape and the notion rape victims are to blame is not the result of a rape culture, but actu-ally the direct result of male supremacy. “Male suprem-acy” is the inherent authority and legitimacy men enjoy simply by being male. It is what is at play when men are not afraid of committing a crime because the victim can easily be discredited not with evidence, but by dress or past behavior. It is what is at play when the victim’s past 
is more important than the crime committed. It is at play 
when men don’t think anyone will believe the victim and will without a doubt take his side.
This male supremacy is built directly into our politi-
cal, economic and cultural institutions, and until we look at the bigger picture and dig out the root cause, rape and rape culture will always exist.
While no one can presume to know how to stop rape 
once and for all, we do know that progressive change 
begins with a strong women’s rights group who can or-
ganize, ﬁ  ght and demand for UF to recognize rape as a real issue on campus and to provide effective awareness and prevention strategies that respects all women. No more waiting and no more lip service. This can change, as long as we demand change together.

“The Walking Dead” pulls record numbers of 
viewers every week. 16.1 million viewers tuned in to the Oct. 13 season premiere, according to 
Nielsen ratings —  not bad for a genre show airing on a cable network. 
The show’s unexpected commercial success 
shines a spotlight on the series’ biggest issue: “The Walking Dead” is a good show. It isn’t a great show. Why isn’t “The Walking Dead” showered with awards and critical accolades?
The zombies aren’t at fault. Pop culture is more 
receptive than ever to science ﬁ  ction and comic book adaptations. “Lost” and “Battlestar Galactica” com-manded massive fan bases and no small amount of critical acclaim. Both were genre shows.
Poor writing cripples “The Walking Dead.” Char-acterization is the show’s most consistent problem. Rick Grimes, the protagonist and de facto leader, is a sucking void of personality, charisma and com-mon sense. 
In a world as bleak as the show’s post-apocalyp-
tic zombie land, you have to give viewers an inter-esting and engaging character to root for.
A show like “The Walking Dead” can’t afford 
to treat its characters like symbols or plot devices. Post-apocalyptic narratives can easily turn into mis-ery porn. 
As long as “The Walking Dead” fails to create 
interesting and engaging characters, it fails to live up to its full potential.

While UF’s administration pushes toward be-
coming a top 10 university, college ranking sys-
tems are shifting their attention from prestige to 
value.
Washington Monthly, Payscale.com, The 
Alumni Factor, Forbes and the Princeton Review 
have recently released varieties of “best value” 
rankings, in which they ranked colleges based on 
affordability and education quality. The New York Times published a story on the trend Sunday.
Aaron Watkins, a 23-year-old UF political sci-
ence senior, said he picked UF over Columbia 
University because of tuition rates and the fact that 
his Florida residence offered him a Bright Futures scholarship.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said students 
and parents are taking the issue of value more se-riously, particularly because the cost of a college education is higher than it’s ever been.
He said UF has consistently been ranked as a 
good value college, and in-state tuition rates re-
main below the national average.
According to UF’s Student Financial Affairs 
website, the average cost of attendance for an un-
dergraduate resident living on or off campus for the 2013-2014 school year is about $20,220.
Out-of-state students pay about $42,498.
“We’re pretty hard to beat,” Orlando said.
Watkins said when he considered where to go 
to college, post-graduate debt also played a large 
role in his decision.
Pharmacy sophomore Charlotte Jung, 19, said tuition value was the most important part of her 
choice to attend UF over the University of Illinois at Chicago.
Jung, a Florida resident, said her decision made 
ﬁ  nancial matters less stressful for her parents due to smaller loans, especially because she has a younger sister who will be in college in two years.
She said she thinks prospective students should 
take college value into account when choosing col-
leges.
“Everyone’s really worried about money right 
now,” Jung said.
Watkins said though prestigious schools are 
highly ranked and respected, high prices are un-
reasonable.
He said students’ outlooks and what they do 
with their education is what matters the most.
“It’s what you make of it,” 
Watkins said. 8, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2013

mentary will be a combination of interviews,

the story to a new generation that may not

  The Riggs family reunion did not go as planned. 
  Cody Riggs had not traveled to Missouri since he visited 
his aunt in St. Louis when he was 5 years old. He wanted to 
play well for her and the rest of his family, which made the 
trip to Columbia, Mo., from South Florida. 
But the redshirt junior never got the opportunity.  With freshman cornerback Vernon Hargreaves III beat 
in coverage, Riggs left his feet to tackle Missouri receiver L’Damian Washington, who held onto the football for a 41-yard catch on the ﬁ  rst play from scrimmage.
  It was not a vicious hit. It just was not legal. 
  Television cameras caught defensive end Ronald Powell, 
missing the game with an ankle injury, consoling the vis-
ibly shaken Riggs.
  “I was shocked at ﬁ  rst, but I saw the replay. I did launch 
myself,” Riggs said Monday. 
“I didn’t think I did on the ﬁ  eld, but if you watch it, I 
guess I did launch myself. 
  “I had no intention of hurting the guy. I thought Vernon 
was going to pick it and when he didn’t, I tried to dive into 
him to see if I can get the ball out, but that’s launching. They 
made the right call. I just have to play smart next time.”
  Riggs was the second Florida player ejected for target-
ing.
Defensive back Brian Poole hit Tennessee tight end Bren-
dan Downs in the fourth quarter and was ejected on Sept. 21. Because the infraction occurred in the ﬁ  rst half, Riggs Safety ready to play again following targeting ejection

   Jacksonville needs to make room 
for another Taylor.
  The city where former Gators 
tailback Fred Taylor became an 
NFL star will be the site of Kelvin 
Taylor’s ﬁ  rst college start when 
Florida plays Georgia on Saturday at EverBank Field.
  “He’s continued to improve 
throughout the season, week to week,” coach Will Muschamp said of Kelvin. “He’s always been a very instinctive, natural runner. It’s very obvious. Again, with assignments 
and different things, I think he’s 
done a nice job and deserves the opportunity.”
  Taylor has impressed in spurts this season, tallying 172 yards on 28 carries with a touchdown. That score came in a 36-17 loss to Mis-souri on Oct. 19, when Taylor en-
joyed a career-best day against 
the Tigers.
  In the ﬁ  rst 
game since start-
er Matt Jones was ruled out for the 
season due to a torn meniscus, Taylor racked up 
74 yards on 12 carries, including 
Florida’s lone touchdown at Faurot 
Field in Columbia, Mo.
  “He’s shown that he can do a lot 
of good things with the ball in his Freshman halfback to 
make ﬁ  rst college start PHILIBUSTER
 With the score tied heading into the sixth 
inning and the Boston Red Sox trailing the St. Louis Cardinals two games to 
one in the World Series, David Ortiz decided he needed to do more than hit Sunday night.
  He had to say something.   Ortiz, as FOX cameras showed brieﬂ  y, gath-
ered up his cronies and delivered an impas-sioned speech. 
What he said remains mostly a mystery, but 
the move worked. 
  Boston put two runners on base — including 
Ortiz — with two outs in the sixth inning before outﬁ  elder Jonny Gomes unloaded on a pitch for a three-run home run to give the Red Sox a 4-1 lead. 
They withstood a late Cardinals rally to win 
4-2 and even the series heading into Monday night’s game.
  Coincidence? Maybe. But when Ortiz is involved in something mag-
ical during the postseason, I have learned to not even consider doubting the man for a second. 
He has been the heart and soul of the Red Sox 
for more than 10 years.   “Any time this guy 
puts on a uniform, there’s a presence,” Gomes told 
reporters after the game. 
“If this guy wants to 
rally us together for a pep 
talk, it was like 24 kin-
dergartners looking up 
at their teacher. He got 
everyone’s attention, and we looked him right in the eyes. That message was pretty powerful.
  “Whatever comes out of his mouth is going 
to be meaningful, priceless and probably some-thing you don’t know. He had everyone’s atten-tion pretty quick. And he gave us the kick in the butt that we needed.”
  A quick Red Sox history lesson — or watching 
Fever Pitch — tells you Boston won a World Se-ries in 1918 before selling Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees and waiting 86 years for another. 
If not for Ortiz, it’s likely we would all still be 
waiting and talking about the Curse of the Bam-bino instead of having already celebrated two Ortiz postseason magic special

  After the Miami Dolphins fell to 
the New England Patriots on Sun-
day in Foxborough, Mass., Dol-phins center Mike Pouncey’s day got even more complicated.
  According to a Sports Illustrated 
report, the Massachusetts State Po-
lice served Pouncey with a grand 
jury subpoena after he exited his 
team’s locker room in Gillette Sta-dium following Miami’s 27-17 loss. The subpoena is related to the in-vestigation of Aaron Hernandez, a close friend and former teammate of Pouncey at UF from 2007-09. 
  Police are focusing on Hernan-
dez’s potential involvement in in-
terstate gun trafﬁ  cking and multiple 
transactions that may have involved Pouncey and Hernandez, although Pouncey’s involvement remains un-determined.
  Being served a subpoena does 
not mean Pouncey has or will be charged with a crime, but police view him as a material witness in 
the Hernandez case. 
  Despite being served a subpoe-
na, Pouncey traveled back to Miami 
with the team later that night. 
  “Organizationally, we do not 
have a comment,” a Dolphins spokesman said about the situation. “And Mike Pouncey does not have a comment.”
Jordan Reed, tight end: Jor-
dan Reed earned his ﬁ  rst NFL start against the Denver Broncos on Sun-day, and the rookie did not disap-point.  Reed, the Gators’ starting tight 
end last season and a third-round pick in the 2013 NFL Draft, followed up his breakout performance against the Chicago Bears a week before 
with another strong showing.He caught eight passes on 14 tar-
gets for a team-high 90 yards during 
the Redskins’ 45-21 road loss to the Broncos.
  In his past three games, Reed has 
recorded 282 receiving yards and a touchdown on 21 catches.
Caleb Sturgis, kicker: The gusty 
conditions in Foxborough clearly affected Dolphins kicker Caleb St-urgis.
  The rookie made his ﬁ  rst ﬁ  eld-goal try — a 52-yarder that put Miami ahead 17-3 with 30 seconds left in the ﬁ  rst half — but his day went downhill from there.  Sturgis’ second try from 46 yards out in the 
third quarter drifted to the right and 
clanked off the upright. 
  The Patriots took advantage of 
the error, scoring the game’s next 24 points.
  Sturgis attempted a 39-yard ﬁ  eld 
goal late in the fourth quarter, hop-ing to cut Miami’s deﬁ  cit to one touchdown, but Pats defensive end 
Chandler Jones came off the edge 
and blocked Sturgis’ kick, handing the Dolphins their fourth-straight loss after a 3-0 start. 
  Notes: During the New York Gi-
ants’ 15-7 win against the Philadel-phia Eagles, Giants safety Will Hill recorded an interception, ﬁ  ve tack-les and a pass deﬂ  ection. 
  His pick came on a Matt Barkley 
pass intended for DeSean Jackson in the ﬁ  nal minute of the game. Follow-ing Hill’s play, New York kneeled to end the contest. 
  After amassing 208 receiving 
yards on 10 catches in his past two games, Eagles receiver Riley Cooper had a quiet afternoon with 13 yards 
on two receptions.
  For the second straight Sunday, 
New York Jets receiver David Nel-
son notched 80 receiving yards — this time on eight catches in a 49-9 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals.

� UNROE HAS 298 DIGS THIS SEASON.
  ERICA A. HERNANDEZ 
 Alligator Writer @EricaAlyssa 
   If Taylor Unroe keeps digging, Florida 
will have to replace the O’Connell Center 
ﬂ  oor.
  The junior was honored on Sunday for 
reaching 1,000 career digs at UF, and she 
responded with 31 digs in the Gators’ two 
matches last weekend.
  “Unroe arguably had her best full week-
end in two matches where she was really 
good in all three of the things that we ask of her,” Wise said. 
“From point scoring behind the service line, anchoring our team serve receive and defending balls.” 
  Unroe is the 12th Gator to reach the 1,000-
dig plateau. The junior currently has 1,214 in her career.
  “I think you combine her serve receive 
that’s been solid since she got here, but her digging skills have improved so much,” Wise said. 
  Unroe’s 31 digs raised her total to a team-
leading 298. No other Gator has 200 digs this season. She leads the team with 4.2 digs per set — 1.6 more than Ziva Recek.
  The senior defensive specialist has played 
a crucial role in Florida’s solid defense. The Gators have swept 16 of their 21 wins this season.  But Unroe provides UF with more than 
just high dig numbers. She has also been serving effectively. 
  Unroe is second on the team in total ser-
vice aces and service aces per set, trailing 
only setter Taylor Brauneis.
  “She deﬁ  nitely is serving the best she has 
since has come to 
Florida,” Wise said. 
“With the jump 
top spin, and she is 
the only regular player who serves that for us, these past few matches she has really served the ball well in terms of the pace.”
  Florida bounced back from a loss to Mis-
souri on Oct. 20 — which ended the Gators’ 13-match winning streak — to earn two home sweeps the following weekend. Win-ning in three sets against both the Tigers and Volunteers helped the Gators stay in conten-tion for an Southeastern Conference cham-pionship. 
  “Winning always helps,” Wise said. 
“Playing at home helps.”
  Wise’s team will not be afforded the lux-
ury of home games this coming weekend. 
Next up, Florida travels to play two road 
matches, starting with LSU at 8 p.m. on Fri-day and ending with Texas A&M at 2 p.m. on Sunday. 
  The two SEC opponents mark the start of 
Florida’s ﬁ  nal eight regular season matches, with the ﬁ  nal home match being played against LSU on Nov. 22.  Junior sparked Florida with weekend defensive performance 
UF Volleyballchampionships in the past nine seasons. 
In 2004, Ortiz carried Boston back from 
the dead — a 3-0 series deficit against the 
vaunted Yankees in the American League 
Championship Series.
He hit a walk-off home run in the 12th in-
ning to win Game 4, and only hours later, 
singled home the winning run in the 14th in-
ning to take Game 5. 
Two wins later, and the Red Sox became 
the first MLB team to ever overcome a 3-0 postseason series deficit. 
Even sweeter was the fact it was against 
the Yankees. 
Nine years later and Ortiz’s postseason 
magic has not stopped. 
In this year’s ALCS, Boston appeared to 
be headed toward an 0-2 hole, which would have been a killer considering the Detroit Ti-gers had ace Justin Verlander waiting on the mound for Game 3 in Detroit. 
But with Boston trailing 5-1 in the eighth 
inning of Game 2, Ortiz smacked a grand slam into the bullpen — just past the out-stretched glove of Tigers right fielder Torii Hunter, who flipped over the fence —  to tie the game.
An inning later, the Red Sox capped a 
dramatic comeback with a walkoff single, and the series was finished in six games. 
Boston now leads the World Series three 
games to one after a 3-1 victory in St. Louis last night. 
It’s no surprise that Ortiz had three hits 
and an RBI to lead the way and is now hit-ting .733 in the series.
Although St. Louis could win the next 
two to claim the title, it’s not going to hap-pen. 
Not when you have awesome beards. Not 
when you have Boston Strong. Not when you have Big Papi. will not have to sit out the first two quarters against Geor-
gia. Poole was not as fortunate.
Riggs does not dislike the rule. Coming from football 
factory Fort Lauderdale St. Thomas Aquinas, the safety has been around the game his entire life and the perils that come with it.
“It’s a good rule because of concussions,” he said. “I 
know people that have played in the NFL with concussions. I understand the intention of the rule.
“But at the same time, my family came all the way up to 
Missouri from South Florida to watch the game, and they 
saw me play for 10 seconds off of a pen-
alty that I really wasn’t trying to hurt any-
body. It has its pros and cons. It’s just one of those rules that you have to live with.”
Riggs had to live with missing the re-
mainder of the game in the locker room, which did not have a TV. He was relegat-ed to watching on a computer screen in-side Faurot Field as Florida’s dropped its 
second straight game.
It has been 10 days since the dependable Riggs had his 
Missouri homecoming cut short. He ranks second on the team with 6.5 tackles for loss and has started all seven games this season.
On Monday, Riggs had all the reason not to smile, as he 
fielded questions for the first time since Missouri. Yet, he smiled despite a losing streak, playing one snap and getting tossed in front of his family. 
He watched Missouri clunk a game-tying chip shot off 
the left uprights to lose in double overtime to South Caro-lina this past Saturday night. Gamecocks coach Steve Spur-rier rushed the field as the Tigers’ faithful stood stunned. 
Riggs, who was also stunned, went crazy, jumped around 
his house and called teammate Jaylen Watkins to bask in their good fortune. As Riggs moved on Monday from his 
brief appearance in Columbia, his team also can during a 
trip to Jacksonville to face Georgia on Saturday.
“We’re back in it. We’re back,” Riggs said. “We still have 
a chance.”hands,” quarterback Tyler Murphy 
said. 
“The coaches and myself have 
to find ways to get him the ball so he can create big plays for us. We’re going to need some explosive plays, and he’s shown that he has the abil-ity to do that.”
Once Taylor scored that touch-
down on a 20-yard scamper in the third quarter, he did not see much 
more action. The freshman received 
only one more carry.
Muschamp admitted on Oct. 23 
that he regretted the move.
“We probably got away from 
that a little early,” Muschamp said of using Taylor in the ground game. “We did.”
But the Gators will not let that 
happen again. Although redshirt junior Mack Brown will remain in-volved, Taylor has finally assumed the role of featured back. Junior full-back Hunter Joyer believes Taylor will capably handle his transition to the spotlight.
“He’s more focused than earlier 
in the season,” Joyer said. “He un-
derstands that we’re relying on him 
now.”
Like his father did before when 
he first joined the Jaguars as the ninth overall pick of the 1998 NFL Draft, Kelvin heads to Jacksonville with a golden opportunity in front of him.
The Gators are confident that the 
son will follow in his father’s foot-steps.
Muschamp said, “He’s a very 
talented runner. He’s a guy that can certainly do some things in the run game. He’s got great vision and great instincts in the run game. Again, we’ve got a lot of confidence in Kel-vin and what he’s doing, and again, 
he’s earned this opportunity.”
Injuries: An ankle injury may 
force Ronald Powell to miss Flori-
da’s game against Georgia for the second consecutive year. 
Muschamp described the red-
shirt junior linebacker’s status for this Saturday’s game in Jacksonville as “up in the air.”
Tyler Murphy, who has a sprained 
AC joint in his right shoulder, is ex-pected to play against the Bulldogs 
after sitting out practice during the 
bye week to rest his shoulder. 
Skyler Mornhinweg took snaps 
with the first team in practice in Murphy’s absence.Defensive tackle Damien Jacobs 
will likely play against Georgia but did not practice Monday. He sat out against Missouri on Oct. 19 due to lingering effects from a head injury 
he suffered against LSU a week ear-
lier.
Darrin Kitchens (shoulder) and 
Colin Thompson (foot) are doubtful to play.

� WESTPHAL IS A SOPHOMORE.
  MICHELLE PROVENZANO
 Alligator Writer @mmprovenzano
   Christen Westphal pushes the 
envelope when it comes to her role 
on the ﬁ  eld.
  The sophomore center back 
charged out of the back line and 
into the attacking third to assume 
the playmaking role on freshman forward Savannah Jordan’s second goal against Texas A&M on Sun-day. 
  “The ball that she played Savan-
nah for the goal was just the perfect weight, right at the right timing, and they had good connection in 
terms of their eye contact when she 
played it,” coach Becky Burleigh 
said. 
  “The fact that that came from a 
double team with her and [junior outside back Tessa Andujar], and 
then she advanced the ball up the 
ﬁ  eld until she felt the need to play it, which was perfect timing. It was a great ball.”
  Westphal’s assist was the second 
of her career and ﬁ  rst this season — a testament to Florida’s unique style where any player can contrib-ute offensively. 
  “It’s unusual that center backs 
get forward, and on our team that’s encouraged — even though some-times that makes me really ner-vous,” Burleigh said. 
  “It’s terriﬁ  c that our players have 
conﬁ  dence in one another for her to get forward and for someone to take her place. For her to go forward and 
us just utilize the numbers up, it’s 
just part of the way we play.”
  While Westphal has given Flori-
da an offensive spark, she has also helped create an impenetrable back line. The Gators have not allowed 
a goal in their last 559 minutes of 
play. 
  Funneling the momentum from 
six straight shutouts in conference play, Florida has the second ranked defense in the Southeastern Confer-ence with a 0.57 goals-against aver-age.
  “Christen is really unusual in 
that last year when she was a fresh-man, she was one of our most con-sistent players,” Burleigh said. 
  “And especially in a position 
like center back, where we put so much responsibility on that person. Her season last year was remark-able. The fact that she’s been able to continue that without any kind of 
sophomore slump is really impres-
sive.” 
  Westphal’s debut in the 2012 
season was what most freshmen could only hope for — starting in 24 games during the season, she was second on the team, averaging 87.2 minutes of playing time per game. 
    Now starting every game and 
playing full 90-minute matches, Westphal has helped the Gators measure up to some steep competi-tion in the SEC.
  “We knew when we got to the 
A&M game they were picked to be ﬁ  rst, so at that point they were the measuring stick in our conference as to who was the best,” Burleigh 
said. 
  “We’ve been in that situation 
several times this year because 
we’ve played several teams that were at some point number one in the conference. I don’t think we 
talk about it in terms of the overall 
picture, but we talk about it as let’s take another step forward.”
Freshman honored: Savannah 
Jordan is the SEC Offensive Soccer Player of the Week, the league an-nounced Monday. Jordan scored three goals during the weekend to raise her season total to 18.  16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2013

   Second-round woes con-
tinued for the Florida men’s 
golf team on Monday at the Invitational at The Ocean 
Course.
  The Gators (+27) dropped 
two spots to eighth after 
shooting 15-over (303) dur-ing the round. South Florida  
leads the tournament at even 
(576) through two rounds.
  “Not a good day at all. I’m 
lost for words,” coach Buddy 
Alexander said in a release. 
“I really thought we would 
have played well this week, 
and it hasn’t happened yet.”
  Junior J.D. Tomlinson led 
the Gators by shooting an 
even-par 72 with three bird-
ies to end his day. Through 
two rounds, Tomlinson has shot 4-over (148) and is tied for 18th place.
  The Gators’ ﬁ  rst-round 
leader, Ryan Orr, struggled Monday. After shooting even Sunday, he dropped ﬁ  ve strokes in the second round an is now 5-over.
  “You have to ﬁ  nd a way to 
get on the board, and we just haven’t done it,” Alexander said. “I have never seen the course this tame. It’s there for the taking, and we just played poorly both days.”  The Florida women’s 
golf team experienced simi-lar struggles in the second round of The Alamo Invita-tional. 
  No. 19 Florida (-4) bat-
tled gusty conditions at the Briggs Ranch Golf Course, which pushed it four strokes behind its ﬁ  rst-round perfor-mance. The Gators are now in sixth place, 10 shots be-hind leader Alabama (-14).
  “The wind was up today 
and the course played tough-er,” coach Emily Glaser said. 
  Sarah Schober (-6) leads 
Florida and is tied for second after making three birdies on the day. The junior is the lone Gator under par after two rounds of play.
  Freshmen Karolina Vl-
ckova and Maria Torres each 
shot 1-over (73) Monday, 
while redshirt sophomore Katie Mitchell shot 3-over (75), struggling after playing 
well in the opening round.
  “We are capable of bird-
ies and have the potential to 
go low,” Glaser said. “That is the goal tomorrow.”
  Both the men’s and wom-
en’s teams will ﬁ  nish their fall season with the third rounds of their respective tournaments today. The men tee off at 8:40 a.m.; the wom-en begin at 9:45 a.m. Gators struggle in
