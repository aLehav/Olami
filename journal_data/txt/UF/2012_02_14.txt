  A Gainesville man stole a car 
from a man who offered him a 
ride home.  
  According to an Alachua 
County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce arrest re-port, Carlos Wims, 20, was arrest-ed Monday morning and charged with stealing 37-year-old Charles Todd’s black Ford Focus after Todd gave him a ride.
  Todd said the two men used to 
work together as day laborers. 
Wims recognized Todd at a 
Kangaroo gas station and asked him for a lift. 
Todd said he’d drive Wims to 
Santa Fe Trace Apartments, where Todd lived. Wims agreed. 
When Todd pulled up to the 
parking lot, Wims asked to bor-row the car to drive to The Cross-ing, where his friends were. Todd 
said no. 
Wims started 
beating on his 
chest and throw-ing punches, so Todd said he got out of the car rather than risk his life.
  “F**k it,” he said. “I’m not go-
ing to kill this guy over a car.”
  Wims then drove off with the 
car, and Todd called 911. Police arrived while Todd was still on the phone.
  According to the arrest report, 
Gainesville Police found the car at a nearby gas station around 2 a.m., and Wims was arrested and transported to Alachua County Jail. Police then drove Todd to pick up his vehicle. He said he learned a lesson about being too nice.
  “It was a cold night, I thought 
I was doing the right thing,” he said. “I was trying to help a broth-er out.”  Ride home

Lindsay McDaniel stood out-side Swamp Restaurant wear-ing a black tube-top dress, waiting for him to arrive.
  It was 2005, and Mapp was

  Mapp hadn’t seemed like the motorcycle type when they met at Grog House that sum-mer, but McDaniel liked the UF law student enough to give him a chance.
  Mapp pedaled up on a beach

� THE CLASS HAS SPOTS 
FOR 40 TO 50 STUDENTS.

Alligator Contributing Writer
In response to recent local 
crimes, the Gainesville Dojo is of-
fering training to those who want to learn how to protect them-selves.
The martial arts facility will 
hold a free, two-day self-defense class on Saturday and Sunday from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. The class is open to men and women 12 years and older, said Keith Teller, owner of Gainesville Dojo and self-de-fense instructor.
The class does not require any 
prior experience and is designed to teach practical self-defense on both a physical and psychological level.
There will be space for 40 to 50 
people. Teller said he will teach participants how to stand bal-anced, how to throw a proper punch, how to maneuver your body when someone is coming at you and how to use personal be-longings to protect yourself.
“This course is not going to 
make you a martial arts or a self-defense expert, but it will give you more awareness and confidence about defending yourself,” he said. “The way society is today, you have to be a little more alert.”
University Police  spokesman 
Maj. Brad Barber said such classes are certainly beneficial, but people also need to be able to assess their own capabilities.Martial arts facility to offer

The freezing temperatures in Gainesville are tak-
ing a vacation.
Cold temperatures, which started Friday night, 
will warm up to 73 degrees today and 78 degrees 
Wednesday.
A high-pressure system from Antarctica cooled 
Gainesville to 25 degrees over the weekend, said Phil Peterson, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Jacksonville.
The cold front started Friday night with tempera-
tures dipping below 40 degrees, according to the Florida Automated Weather Network.
Peterson said the cold front is moving clock-
wise, pulling warm air from the Gulf of Mexico and warming up Gainesville as the front moves toward the southwest.
The warm temperatures will stay longer than the 
cold temperatures, he said.
Today’s low is in the mid-30s, Wednesday’s is in 
the mid-50s and Thursday’s is in the upper 50s, he said.
Cold temperatures drew more customers than 
usual to V olta Coffee, Tea & Chocolate, said Jenny Todd, a 25-year-old employee.
“When it gets colder, people crave more hot 
drinks and less cold drinks,” Todd said.However, the freezing temperatures hurt Gaines-
ville’s farmers.
Travis Mitchell, a 26-year-old community food 
project coordinator of Florida Organic Growers, lost his snow peas to the weekend frost.
The freezing temperatures can kill part of a plant’s 
leaves, causing the plant to take longer to grow.
Below the surface, the crop suffers even more, he 
said. Plant cells are damaged when a plant thaws af-ter a freeze.
“It’s poetic,” Mitchell said. “It’s the returning 
warmth that lays the final blow.”
Plants like tomatoes, radishes and some varieties 
of lettuce cannot make it through a hard freeze, he said.
Some gardeners protect their plants from the cold 
by covering them with blankets to trap the heat, and naturally formed tree canopies can help keep plants warm.
Strawberry gardeners use sprinklers to warm 
their plants, he said, because heat is released by the water freezing on the strawberries.
“A few degrees will make all the difference,” 
Mitchell said. Temperatures to warm up this week
“When it gets colder, people crave 
more hot drinks and less cold drinks.”

Volta Coffee, Tea & Chocolate employeevolunteering for the Peace Corps in Moldova.
About 7 percent of Peace Corps volunteers are married 
couples, said spokeswoman Erin Durney.
Mapp, 30, and McDaniel, 27, are not the only couple 
that started in Gainesville and ended up across the world 
for a 27-month term with the Peace Corps.
UF alumna Ilana Echevarria-Stewart and her husband 
Nate, a Gainesville middle school science teacher, work in Guyana. They have been together for about five years.
Both couples get to model equal-status marriages in 
places where balanced relationships typically aren’t the standard.
For example, men in Moldova are generally steadfast 
in traditional gender roles. The fact that Mapp does his share of cleaning shocked McDaniel’s married coworker.
They work together overseas just as they did in their 
College Park apartment behind University Avenue.
“One of the Peace Corps goals is to try to explain 
American values to other cultures,” McDaniel said. “So it’s kind of a neat thing that we bring to the table.”
Married couples that apply to the Peace Corps are 
placed in foreign countries together, said spokeswoman Kristina Edmunson. The organization looks specifically for job assignments where the couples can live together.
For Mapp and McDaniel, this means going to separate 
jobs — he at a community development organization, she at a 25-person domestic violence shelter — but returning home to the same place.
There, they can cook Mapp’s mom’s famous fettuccine, 
complain about Moldova’s single-digit temperatures and reminisce about Gator football games.
“It would be a completely different experience with-out somebody that you’re married to and living with over here,“ Mapp said. “I don’t know how the other people do it.”
Being a Peace Corps volunteer is personally challeng-
ing, McDaniel said, so she loves sharing the experience with her husband.
“It keeps me really grounded,” she said. “It’s such an 
invaluable luxury.”
In South America, the Stewarts feel similarly. Ilana, 26, 
is an administrative health promoter and Nate, 29, works with the education department.
When she needed an emergency appendectomy about 
a day after they arrived for training, he was with her.
He was with her as they journeyed to the nearest hos-
pital – which meant canoeing, walking a half-mile over flooded land and driving a Land Rover through mud for an hour just to reach a paved highway.
He was with her as they stayed in Guyana’s capital 
while she recovered with no painkillers stronger than Ty-lenol.
But he won’t be with her for Valentine’s Day today.This week, Ilana is in a remote part of Guyana train-
ing new volunteers. She doesn’t have phone or Internet access.
But that’s no problem for them.The two are always on the same page, Stewart said.“We just love each other, man,” he said. “We’re just a 
really good match.”4, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2012

Discussion also included 
tuition, Reitz renovation
because they are already allotted 
to UPD.
Tuition was another popu-
lar topic. Villamil said he wants to band together with larger schools to “[fix] Bright Futures problems.”
Students Party treasurer can-
didate Carly Wilson said she wants to know where the 15 percent tuition increase is going if classes are being cut. She also said SG agencies get money that should be going toward other organizations.
However, Unite Party treasur -
er candidate and current Student Body Vice President Juan Rodri-guez said there was no wasteful spending on the $40,000 cabinet budget. Rodriguez added that he wanted to increase communi-cation between organizations to cut wasteful spending.
The debate also touched on 
the Make it Reitz campaign to renovate and expand the Reitz Union. Cornillie said he will fo-cus on structural issues before making a “fancy” union.
Villamil said 
the Reitz is a student union, not a facility.
“It should 
be a place for students and 
Gators to share and collabo-
rate,” he said.
Cornillie said the Students 
Party wants to add recycling bins and solar panels. Villamil said his party wants to create a bike rental program and use more e-books.DeBATe , from page 1

As a toddler, Jason Raikes would take 
apart and inspect his toys. He grew to be a 
man who helped people put together com-puters and relationships simply because he could.
Following his death, his friends and fam-
ily remember him as someone who brought home stray pets and lost friends. He’d spent the last months of his life with his girlfriend, Christie Nguyen. Some said he was the hap-piest they’d ever seen him.
Raikes, 26, died Jan. 29 in a series of 
wrecks on Interstate 75. He is one of 11 vic-tims.
Deanna Davison, a 24-year-old friend of 
Raikes, said he would drop anything to help a friend.
“He was always about getting people to 
feel better about themselves,” said Davison, who is from Richmond, Va., “which is what friends should do.”
She said he would spend countless hours 
on the phone helping her recover from boy trouble and took time from his night to fix her computer. She remembers a day when her keyboard was broken, she had work to do and the pouring rain wasn’t helping her spirits.
“He just said, ‘Come on over, I’ll fix it,’” she said.
Born in Chesterfield County, Va., Rai-
kes attended Lloyd C. Bird High School. He discovered he had a knack for Japanese 
and a soft spot for animals and friends who needed a home, said his mom, Rob-in Raikes.
He adopted an aban-
doned golden retriever, 
Boddie, who became one of his closest companions.
After graduation, he 
worked with computers and lived in the apartment above his parents’ barn. Ev-ery night, he would make dinner and they would shout out answers to “Wheel of For-tune.”
She said he was a homebody, which 
made his decision to move to Gainesville to live with Christie all the more unexpected.
He was taking online classes at Western 
Governors University and hoped to get a job at UF’s IT department, she said.
Even several states away, he would call 
home every Sunday.
“He would always say, ‘Mom, you can 
jump in the car and see me anytime,’” she said. “‘I’m not dead. I’m just 700 miles away.’”
His surviving family includes his mom; 
his dad, Rennie; and his sister, Caitlyn.

For the first time, prospec-
tive law students will be able 
to see detailed information about law schools all in one place.
In December, Law School 
Transparency, a nonprofit organization focused on le-gal education policy, asked American Bar Association-accredited law schools to send information about their recent graduates’ jobs and salaries.
UF already sends these 
reports to the National As-sociation for Law Placement and the American Bar Asso-ciation, but those organiza-tions only provide statistics nationally and by state, not individually.
When LST releases that information, prospective law students will be able to com-pare schools side by side.
“As far as picking your 
school, those statistics would be extremely helpful,” said 24-year-old UF law student Kathryn Barkett.
Pascale Bishop, assistant 
dean of the law school’s Cen-ter for Career Development, said UF will submit infor -
mation about its 2011 gradu-ates in late February or early March. The data for the class of 2010 was submitted in ear -
ly January.
LST’s request for specific 
data came after complaints and lawsuits from gradu-ates saying their law schools misrepresented online data about employment and sala-ries after graduation.

Shands at UF is adding a second 
helicopter that will focus on calls 
from Marion County.
ShandsCair, the air medical and 
critical care transport system for Shands, will begin operating its new helicopter and base, ShandsCair 2, on Wednesday.
Spruce Creek Fire Station 30 in 
Summerfield will host the base. An EC135 helicopter will sit on a concrete helipad at the station until called by ShandsCair, which receives three calls a day on average, said Shand-sCair program director Staccie Allen.
Operations will begin at 8 a.m. on 
Feb 15, Allen said.The helicopter will also be used 
for other areas when the first one is in use.
Allen said she did not know how 
much the project cost.
Patients picked up by the new he-
licopter will be brought to Shands and other hospitals within an ap-proximate 210-mile radius.
“The idea is to get more people 
to treatment faster,” Allen said. “In the world of medicine, the faster you treat them, the more likely they are to have a positive outcome.”
The project has been planned for 
about a year, and the Marion County Board of County Commissioners ap-proved it in January.
The station chosen for the base 
has eight open acres on its property, and it already had space to house ShandsCair staff, said Marion Coun-ty Fire Rescue spokeswoman Jessica Greene.Shands gets new helicoptercRime

The Alachua County Sheriff’s Office ar -
rested a Gainesville man Monday morning on 
a charge of killing his 1-year-old daughter — about 15 months after the girl died.  
Christopher J. Strawder, 24, was charged 
with homicide and aggravated abuse toward a child for the Nov. 19, 2010 incident.
Members of the Sheriff’s Office responded 
to a 911 call at 5021 SW 64th St., Sgt. Todd Kelly said Monday. Only Strawder and his daughter Kamir were home.
Strawder told officers he was in his bedroom 
when he heard a loud thump from the kitchen. Kamir must have fallen from the countertop, he said.
Strawder said he found his daughter hav-
ing a seizure on the ground. She was later pronounced dead at Shands at UF, Kelly said, adding that Strawder’s account did not add up with the autopsy report. Medical examiners found a fracture in the back of the baby’s head and ruptured blood vessels in the small intes-tine and one of her eyes, Kelly said.
Though Strawder was a suspect, the State Attorney’s Office did not issue an arrest war -
rant until Thursday. In the 15 months between Kamir’s death and Strawder’s arrest, ASO waited for reports from the Medical Examiner’s Office and the Florida Department of Children and Families.
“This was a case where we had to rely al-
most exclusively on the medical examiners and the doctors’ expert opinions,” Kelly said.
At about 3 a.m. Monday , 
detectives arrested Strawder at the Kangaroo Express at 4324 SW 20th Ave., where Strawder worked as a clerk. 
Kamir’s mother, Ka-
trina Thomas, could not be reached for comment Mon-day . Strawder and Thomas lived together at 7204 SW 
44th Place until they were evicted in June, ac-cording to public records.
One of their former roommates said Mon-
day he did not know where the couple moved. According to the Clerk of the Courts, Strawder and Thomas have another child.
Strawder was held at the Alachua County 
Jail on Monday night with a $1.2 million bail.Man charged with killing baby

Valentine’s Day not 
worth complaints
  We have all heard these lines:
  “Valentine’s Day is a corporate holiday invented 
by corporations to sell candy and stuff.”
  “It’s just a holiday invented by Hallmark to sell cards.”  “I hate Valentine’s Day because I don’t have anyone.”  If you have not uttered one of these statements at one point 
in your life, you are kidding yourself.
  If, for some reason, you still rely on these platitudes when-
ever Valentine’s Day comes around, we have this to say:
  Shut up!  Expressions like the ones previously mentioned have be-
come just as cliche on Valentine’s Day as hearts, candy, ﬂ  ow-ers and, especially, greeting cards.
  Grow up and stop complaining about something that has 
no effect on your life. If you don’t care about Valentine’s Day, why exhaust yourself complaining about it?
  If you think Valentine’s Day is an important holiday but 
you hate it because you reside in a state of perpetual loneli-ness, then you need to get over yourself.
  Chances are, life isn’t as bad as you think it is.  Just because you may not have a signiﬁ  cant other to share 
this holiday with does not mean you shouldn’t celebrate it.
  Before you write off Valentine’s Day and go into your cor-
ner, curl up into a ball and cry, think about ways that you direct your emotions to more positive outlets.
  For instance, Valentine’s Day doesn’t have to be about ro-
mantic love. Everyone has friends and family for whom they have strong feelings. Wouldn’t it be a better use of time to remind these people, whether it be your parents, siblings or best friends, just how much you love and appreciate them?
  You could accomplish this by doing something as simple 
as sending a nice text saying, “Happy Valentine’s Day!”
  For the guys, you could call up some buddies and go grab 
a drink or some food.
  You could call your mom or your dad and tell them how 
much you appreciate their support and encouragement.
  If you have a platonic friend of the opposite sex, you could 
still have fun and go see a movie with them. Who knows, maybe that friend who’s “just a friend” could turn out to be more.
  The point is that Valentine’s Day is not going away any-
time soon. There’s no point in turning into a curmudgeon, sitting at home and pouting about how much you hate this holiday.
  Life is too damn short to be mad all the time, especially on 
a day that’s supposed to be about happiness.
  Valentine’s Day might seem like it’s reserved for those 
with signiﬁ  cant others. However, it should also be a reminder to those who are single that there are people around them who are just as important. 
 Hazing has no place in college experience
  Surprise, surprise: another hazing incident in the head-
lines. This time, controversy surrounds UF’s own Al-pha Phi Alpha, which has consequently been tempo-
rarily suspended after allegations of hazing surfaced last week.
  Reports have indicated physical abuse and visible in-
juries, though no speciﬁ  c details have been given out. It is relieving to know that no one has been hospitalized, al-though any form of hazing on campus should not be toler-ated.
  President Bernie Machen’s email to students announc-
ing the investigation of the fraternity was a prompt and necessary response. The email reassured me that students’ safety is a top priority on the president’s long-running list.
  The timing of the allegations could not have been worse, 
as the discerning eyes of the nation were already ﬁ  xed on neighboring FAMU’s November hazing incident, in which a 26-year-old drum major died. Several involved with his death are now under state investigation, and the univer-sity’s once legendary Marching 100 band is now defamed.
  The timing and location are too close for comfort, and 
the reputation of Florida frats may be beginning to snow-ball.
  In my dictionary, Greek life is synonymous with trouble. 
The road to bid acceptance and the subsequent lifestyle is not always worth the promised perks.
  In my opinion, the whole process is a bit crooked. After 
you get all dolled up and spend a few nights kissing ass for total strangers, the brothers and sisters convene and discuss you to see if you are “a good ﬁ  t.”
  If you are worthy of their approval, you are offered a 
bid that you can accept and then pay some obscene amount for fees, which, in many cases, contradicts the “best value” aspect of UF. Many come to school here because they want to graduate with little or no debt at all, yet end up binding themselves to yearly membership fees.
  There’s always an initiation process. Some are more 
symbolic and welcoming than customarily “paying your dues.”  Undeniably, UF is home to 
wholesome sororities and frater-nities that are all about brother-hood and sisterhood, but these atmospheres naturally foster su-periority of veterans over fresh meat, even within the so-called “family.”
  Hazing has a wide spectrum: 
It may be as minor as a “big” 
making a fake Facebook account for a “little” with embar-rassing pictures and information, or it could be a serious criminal offense, physically, sexually and verbally humili-ating others for the sake of tradition.
  The latter occurs in hundreds of universities across the 
nation, where power-starved upperclassmen ruthlessly prey upon newcomers. It’s the epitome of dehumaniza-tion.
  It is also a grandfathered cycle: Someone was picked on 
and humiliated when he or she ﬁ  rst began, and now it’s his or her turn to “keep the tradition going.”
  It’s a shame in UF’s case that a historic black fraternity 
has to suffer through this type of incident. Alpha Phi Al-pha’s purpose is to serve as a networking tool for young, ambitious African-American students. Now, the organiza-tion is at risk of being permanently dismantled.
  My hope is that the allegations against Alpha Phi Al-
pha are false. However, if that is not the case, whoever is responsible should be harshly dealt with in order to serve as an example for others who may cross the line in initia-tion practices.
  I don’t expect Greek life to disappear overnight; in fact, 
I’m not suggesting that would even be a viable solution. I hope students recognize abuse up front and walk away from fraternities and sororities that do so, as well as report any serious incidents. A life could be at stake.
  College is a time to meet and socialize with others, usu-
ally without a paddle involved.

Student Body president responds 
to Students Party candidate
In a letter to the editor published 
yesterday, SG presidential candidate Alex Cornillie seriously misled read-ers in his diatribe against my stance on Florida House Joint Resolution 931 and Florida Senate Joint Resolution 1508.
I, along with the Student Body presi-
dent at Florida State University, have been avidly fighting in support of this legislation for quite some time now. Contrary to what Cornillie would like students to believe, this initiative is de-signed to restore a fair and equitable process of representation on the Florida Board of Governors.
As it currently stands, there is one 
seat on the board reserved for a student. Per the Florida Constitution, this seat is reserved for the chairman of the Florida Student Association, an organization comprised of Student Body presidents from Florida’s state universities. In order for Student Body presidents to become members of this exclusive organization, they are required to pay thousands of dollars in fees.
No, this money does not come from 
their personal finances — instead, Stu-dent Body presidents all over Florida use student fee money (yes, your mon-ey) to finance their membership in FSA. And while some money goes into le-gitimate purposes such as lobbying and advocating, much of it goes to finance lavish retreats and social networking opportunities.
As the Student Body president of 
UF, I cannot, in good conscience, spend student fee money on expenses that do not go to serving UF students. FSA should not be able to hold the fact that its chairman sits on the board as a stick for membership.
The needs of the more than 50,000 
students at UF can be entirely different than students at other state universi-ties, some of which have fewer than 1,000 students. It goes without saying that there are bound to be conflicts of interest, which has happened in the past. Why should I authorize the use of student money for an organization that sometimes lobbies against the best in-terests of UF students?
Cornillie fails to mention that as a re-
sult of my efforts in Tallahassee, along with the efforts of many other students both here at UF and FSU, emergency action was taken within FSA last week. Membership is now free, and all univer -
sities have an equal opportunity to run for chairmanship of the FSA. Thanks to the coordinated action and honorable leadership at UF and FSU, students are no longer footing the bill for a private club of some Student Body presidents around the state.
One of the most vocal complaints 
about my actions from other university SG organizations is that Florida House Joint Resolution 931 and Florida Senate Joint Resolution 1508 give UF and FSU too much power. As long as I represent more than 50,000 students at UF, I will not take shame in advocating on their behalf to the best of my ability.
God bless and go Gators!
Anthony E. Reynolds
Student Body presidentLetter to the Editor
A few weeks ago, a mobile exhibition 
called “America’s Farmers” visited UF and parked on the North Lawn. 
With a mission to celebrate American family farmers, the exhibition offered a pamphlet, a short tour and a video of the lives of these rural Americans.
Curious (and skeptical), I looked into the 
campaign.
America’s Farmers is sponsored by 
Monsanto, the world’s largest agricultural biotechnology corporation. It makes herbi-cides, pesticides and genetically engineered seeds that produce unnaturally abundant and tasteless crops. Many of these products are only effective and compatible with oth-er Monsanto products. That is, Monsanto seeds require specific Monsanto fertilizer.
The list of Monsanto’s legal issues is as 
disturbing as it is expansive. The organiza-tion has been sued for the adverse side ef-fects of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War, for the questionable safety of saccha-rin (the carcinogenic compound that makes most of your “zero calorie” drinks taste so sweet) and, most recently, it has been found guilty of chemical poisoning in France.
To offer a point of reference: If you’ve 
seen the movie “Michael Clayton” with George Clooney, the company he’s investi-gating for misconduct, “U/North”, is based on Monsanto.
In the real 
world, Monsanto is careful to ex-clude what many consider accu-rate warnings and health-safety claims from its product labels. 
The company claims that, when used prop-erly, its products (remember, we’re talking about insect and plant poisons) are safe for human handling and, eventually, consump-tion.
Yet, a French farmer who experienced 
memory loss, stammering and headaches since he inhaled a Monsanto weed killer in 2004 would strongly disagree. 
Despite the shocking number of Monsan-
to court cases, the company often emerges with little more than lawyer fees, as plain-tiffs have been unable to clearly show the relation between the illness and the side ef-fects of the pesticides.
Within this discourse, as in the discourse 
of all controversial issues, is the question of the advocates of the company within con-sideration.
My worry is whether or not UF and its 
administrators see themselves as ethically accountable for hosting or inviting a com-pany with such questionable tactics to fea-ture its exhibition (and feature its brand) in the middle of campus?
Excuses of “We support ‘America’s 
Farmers,’ not Monsanto” are as shallow as they are baseless. If you want to support farmers (local farmers, not monocultural mega-farmers) visit the farmers market. In-vite local farmers to host a market on cam-pus to share Alachua County’s large farm-ing population and to sell their reasonably priced, healthy and generally pesticide- and herbicide-free crops to students and fac-ulty.
I don’t know the specifics of the agree-
ment between UF and Monsanto to feature the “America’s Farmers” exhibit on campus, so I am not entitled to judge the university’s actions except at face value. But when Tiger Woods’ affairs were revealed, Gatorade cut connections with the golfer, publicly de-nouncing his misconduct.
Will UF similarly make a public de-
nouncement of Monsanto, a company that has been charged with sharecropping and unethical monopolization and has now been found guilty of chemical poisoning?
It’s fair to say that it must.Dyllan Furness is a philosophy and English

opinions@alligator.org
This weekend, Republicans in Maine held their presidential 
caucus, and the winner was Mitt Romney, with an avalanche of 2,190 total votes.
To put that in perspective, more frat guys will be forced by their 
houses to take a break from hazing and vote for the Unite Party next week than Republicans in an entire state voted for Romney. Hardly a ringing endorsement.
But then again, should anyone be surprised by the lack of ex-
citement toward the conservative movement in this country? By its very nature, it is a negative ideology: Conservatives do not support anything, they only oppose things. And in times like we live in to-day, no one is in the mood for a party with no real ideas.
If you don’t believe me, look at the positions held by the Re-
publican candidates this year: repeal health care reform, undo labor protections, get rid of social programs, remove regulations on busi-ness, make birth control illegal, etc.  By defi-nition, conservatives are in the business of focusing backwards. That might be a joke about Rick Santorum, but it’s so easy, who 
can even tell anymore?
Even Ron Paul, the candidate who is supposed to be “different”, 
wants to return us to the glory days when restaurants didn’t have to serve black people. I guess it might qualify as a new idea, but he doesn’t even have a problem with individual states establish-ing their own official religions, as long as the federal government doesn’t. However, that might qualify as an Articles of Confedera-tion-type idea, so maybe he just wants to go back further than any-one.

Softball freshman receives honor
Florida freshman infielder Sami Fagan was named 
SEC Freshman of the Week on Monday after hitting .667 with 10 hits and two steals last weekend.Florida baseball picked to win SEC
The Gators’ top-ranked baseball team was picked Monday 
by the conference’s coaches to repeat as Southeastern Conference champions this season. Florida junior Mia Piccio and senior Evan Jensen carded 1-over rounds of 72 to lead UF after the first day of play at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge.See story at alligatorSports.org.
JOHN BOOTHE
Alligator Staff Writer
Whenever Billy Donovan hears 
a dead-ball whistle, he expects at 
least one of his players to come alive and reign in the rest of his teammates.
There doesn’t need to be any 
high-fives in the huddle or chest bumps when a timeout is called. Yelling and screaming aren’t necessarily the prerequisites Donovan is looking for in a vocal leader.
Instead, a simple fire and pas-
sion for playing are needed. Two important characteristics that have been sorely lacking from the Gators during their two-game slide in Southeastern Conference play, featuring a 20-point drub-bing on national TV and a home loss to a 13-12 team.
Ahead of No. 14 Florida’s (19-
6, 7-3 SEC) road trip to Alabama (16-8, 5-5 SEC) tonight at 7, Dono-van said he can’t be the sole voice of inspiration for the Gators.
Veteran guards Kenny Boyn-
ton and Erving Walker — UF’s lone senior — will need to carry some of the load and lead by more than just example, even if it’s not in their nature.
“Erving is not a very, very vo-
cal, demonstrative kind of player, and I’m probably putting him in situations that are making him uncomfortable,” Donovan said. “But I think our team needs to see more fire, more energy, more pas-sion out of him. That would help us.” 
While Donovan was pleased 
with the progress Boynton made in UF’s five-point loss to Tennes-see last Saturday,  getting more from Florida’s soft-spoken point guard has proven difficult.
In his last two games, the 
5-foot-8 Walker has four turnovers to just three assists, bumping him to second in the overall SEC as-sist standings. During Florida’s seven-game win streak — when Walker still led in the category — he was averaging 5.3 assists and 1.6 turnovers per outing.
Donovan said a big reason for 
the inconsistency lately at the point has been the lack of a sec-ond ball handler for Walker to rely on. 
Last season, the Gators leaned 
heavily on Chandler Parsons, the SEC’s Player of the Year, to refo-cus the team when Walker lost control. 
“Chandler Parsons was a great 
outlet for Erving Walker because when Erving got into maybe tak-ing some quick, ill-advised shots, over-penetrating, (we could) put it in Chandler’s hands and kind of facilitate offense through him a little bit and get Erv off the ball,” Donovan said.
Though Florida’s replacement 
for the 6-foot-9 Parsons this sea-son, freshman Brad Beal, can at times match the former Gator’s rebounding numbers, Donovan said he isn’t willing to place even more responsibility on the first-year guard’s shoulders by asking him to run the offense. 
Beal leads Florida with 54 turn-
overs — two more than Walker. 
Brett Le Blanc / Alligator Staff

UTAH AND MIAMI DOLPHINS ASSISTANT TIM DAVIS TO ITS STAFF MONDAY.
TOM GREEN
Alligator Staff Writer
Florida parted ways with 
offensive line coach Frank Ver -
ducci to make room for one of 
coach Will Muschamp’s former colleagues Monday.
The team announced Mus-
champ hired former Utah of-fensive line coach Tim Davis to replace V erducci, who has decided to “pursue other inter -
ests,” according to Muschamp. 
Davis has coached for more 
than 25 years and brings 18 years of experience as an of-fensive line coach in Division I football and the NFL to Florida, where the Gators’ line struggled during Muschamp’s inaugural season.
“Tim is a perfect fit for our 
program — he has a history of coaching in a pro-style offense and shares the same program philosophies,” Muschamp said in a press release. 
“It will be a seamless transi-
tion for our players and staff. … He understands the values that we put on the line of scrim-mage, and he will help us get where we want to be at that position.” 
Davis worked with Mus-
champ in 2005 with the Miami Dolphins and has also worked with running backs coach Brian White, tight ends coach Derek Lewis and defensive coordina-tor Dan Quinn. 
He said his experience with 
Muschamp and other members of UF’s staff will be a benefit, es-pecially in the early going.
“I’ve been on a number 
of coaching staffs and usu-ally there is a transition period when you join a new staff,” Da-vis said. “I don’t look at this as joining a new staff.”
The personnel change comes 
less than two weeks after Mus-champ stressed the importance of the Gators improving along both lines of scrimmage during a press conference on National Signing Day.
As the Gators limped to a 7-6 
record last season, the offensive line was largely overpowered in the team’s six losses. Florida tied for 54th in the nation by al-lowing 23 sacks, with 20 com-ing during defeats.
The offensive line also 
struggled in the run game, as the team finished with the na-tion’s No. 73 rushing offense (143 yards per game).
While the unit was able to 
open holes against in-ferior op-ponents, the 
Gators aver -
aged just 61.8 yards per game and 2.1 yards per carry in their 
six losses.
Davis’ line at Utah last sea-

Florida sophomore guard Jaterra Bonds has played 1,654 minutes since joining 
the team last season and is the only Gator to start every game this year.  
� THE GUARD HAS PLAYED MORE 
THAN 1,500 MINUTES IN TWO SEASONS WITH THE GATORS.

  Jaterra Bonds has been a key player for the 
Gators since she arrived on campus.
  The sophomore guard has logged 1,654 min-
utes during her two-year career at Florida.
  Only redshirt senior guard Jordan Jones, who 
has 1,819 minutes, has accrued more time on the 
court since the beginning of last season.
  Bonds has taken advantage of extensive play-
ing time early in her career, putting together a solid resume with career averages of 9.4 points, 2.5 assists and 2.3 rebounds per game.
  She earned a spot on the All-Southeastern 
Conference Freshman team last season, playing in a UF-freshman-record 34 games.
  Perhaps her best stretch came when she aver-
aged 15.4 points per contest in the Gators’ ﬁ  nal ﬁ  ve games of the 2010-11 season.
  While she has not yet duplicated that scoring 
tear this season, Bonds has still put up respect-able scoring numbers, notching her 10th double-digit scoring effort of the year with 12 points in last Thursday’s 70-55 win against Auburn.
  However, Bonds’ three points and three 
turnovers in Sunday’s 62-58 loss to No. 25 South Carolina serve as a reminder of her youth.  
  “Jaterra is a very basketball-savvy player, she 
usually knows the right play to make,” assistant coach Brenda Mock Kirkpatrick said. “Some-times, she gets a little overzealous, and some-times, that can affect her decision-making.”
  Bonds’ issues boil down mostly to shot selec-
tion and her ability to take care of the ball.
  She has recorded a 34.1 ﬁ  eld-goal percent-
age, including a team-low 28.3 clip in SEC play , and her 66 turnovers rank second-most among Gators with 19 or more starts this season.
  However, the frequency of Bonds’ giveaways 
has improved from last season from one turn-over every 8.5 minutes to one turnover every 11.1 minutes.
  “She does a great job of absorbing the game 
plan and learning from week-to-week,” head coach Amanda Butler said. 
“She is really striving to make better deci-
sions because she knows how important that is for us.”
  Bonds’ experience has aided not only her per-
formance on the court but her leadership role on the team.
  Through Butler’s multiple lineup shifts, 
Bonds is the only player who has started every game for the Gators this season.
  “If I’m not talking, I don’t feel comfortable,” 
Bonds said. “I have to talk, like instructing, if I see something wrong, to help my teammate out.” 
  Bonds ﬁ  ts in with Butler’s up-tempo style, 
making her a vital piece in Florida’s transition game and full-court press.
  As Bonds continues to gain experience early 
in her career, she hopes to make waves with the Gators on the national stage as she made clear during Florida’s media day before the season began.
  “My goal is when they talk about college bas-
ketball, I want them to mention my name.”

 Bonds proving clutch for Florida Against Tennessee, Beal had 
three giveaways.
“We didn’t compete at 
all really,” Beal said. “We weren’t really focused. We weren’t getting any offense at all. We were just jack-ing up shots. Our mentality throughout the whole game — we just weren’t focused at all.”
Beal blamed much of 
the team’s 
s t r u g g l e s after the loss on poor practices.  Boynton  echoed that s e n t i m e n t and said it 
only takes a single player to throw Florida off its rhythm on both sides of the ball.
“If one person is having a 
bad game, then he might be 
down for some reason, and it’s messing us up defen-sively, not rotating or some-thing,” Boynton said. 
“So I think one person 
having a bad game or some-thing like that, I think he just needs to put that behind his head and focus on the team.”

After levying four suspensions in the past 
week, Alabama coach Anthony Grant said 
Monday that two of those players — guards Trevor Releford and Andrew Steele — will “most likely” be back for tonight’s matchup with Florida.  
Forwards JaMychal Green and Tony Mitch-
ell remain suspended indefinitely. 
Prior to Saturday’s game against LSU, 
Green and Mitchell had combined for 37.4 percent of Alabama’s points and 35.9 percent of the team’s rebounds. 
Green leads the Crimson Tide in points per 
game with 14.1 and rebounds per game with 7.2.
Mitchell is second in both categories with 
13.1 points per game and 7.0 rebounds per contest. 
No other Crimson Tide player averages 
more than 3.8 rebounds per game.
Mitchell also leads Alabama with 31 
blocked shots, with Green right behind at 29. 
“You always prepare for their full team, 
that’s what we’re expecting,” UF coach Billy Donovan said. “The last thing I would want to have happen for our team is to assume some-thing or somebody not playing and then all of a sudden they’re out there.”
Injury update: Donovan said Monday that 
Will Yeguete and Mike Rosario will be out Tuesday against Alabama. 
Rosario is still dealing with a hip pointer, 
while Yeguete is yet to pass three portions of UF’s five-part concussion test after he was knocked unconscious early in Saturday’s loss to Tennessee. 
Although Yeguete is not suffering any 
symptoms of dizziness or illness, Donovan said the sophomore forward still needs time to rest and that light and movement are not good for his recovery process.  
Donovan said Yeguete is not close to pass-
ing certain portions of the test, including a bal-ance indicator that requires him to stand on one leg with his eyes closed. 
“This could be a couple weeks, this could 
be a week, could be three weeks,” Donovan said. “I’d say right now, with where his symp-toms are at, I feel pretty confident that he’ll be out this entire week.”
Yeguete also suffered a minor concussion 
courtesy of an elbow from forward Jared Sullinger in a loss to Ohio State on Nov. 15. He missed UF’s next game against UNF before re-turning against Wright State on Nov. 21.
Donovan added that Cody Larson was 
a limited participant in practice but will be available tonight after missing Saturday’s game with an illness. Donovan said Larson lost weight, and his conditioning has suf-fered. 
Replacing Yeguete: With Yeguete side-
lined for at least this week, Donovan is turn-ing to Casey Prather to pick up the slack. 
Prather admitted Monday that he’s strug-
gled with his confidence as the result of lim-ited playing time and production but said that a meeting with Donovan on Sunday helped alleviate some of his concerns. Donovan thinks Prather can be a valuable 
fill-in for Yeguete because of his length and athleticism at the top of UF’s press defense. 
To be successful, the 6-foot-6 Prather said 
he has to slow the game down and use his quickness against bigger opponents. 
Prather has been held back by an inability 
to “read the game,” but his effort has never been a concern.
“He ‘s never had a bad attitude,” Donovan 
said. “He comes to practice every day and works. He’s put extra time in. He deserves to play well.”
Donovan said UF will likely shrink the 
floor and press less as a result of sometimes having to use Brad Beal and Scottie Wilbekin at the power forward position.
One option Donovan does not plan to 
turn to is freshman Walter Pitchford, who has struggled to retain the offense and scouting re-ports after missing time with a wrist injury.

After jumping out to a quick lead Saturday, the Gators 
were not the same.
In the 11-9 season-opening loss, Florida struggled to keep 
up with North Carolina after an early 2-0 advantage.
“We definitely came out strong in the first two minutes,” 
Gators junior attacker Kitty Cullen said. “And then we just 
didn’t play like ourselves for the rest of the game. We just didn’t play a full 60 minutes like the team that we are, and it resulted in a loss.”
Florida led by two 2:02 into the game but gave up three 
straight goals before tying the score on a man-up goal from junior attacker Caroline Chesterman.
After Chesterman’s score, the Gators went more than 25 
minutes without finding the back of the net. Cullen said the drought was the result of the Gators not playing with proper focus.
UNC took the lead for good with four unanswered goals 
to end the first half, including a score with just one second remaining.
Eight minutes into the second half, the Tar Heels extend-
ed their lead to 8-3 on a goal from junior midfielder Emily Garrity.
“I don’t think there was a sense of urgency once we got 
down by four goals,” Gators coach Amanda O’Leary said. “I think there needed to be more of a sense of urgency on ground balls, making sure we were possessing the ball and getting good opportunities.”
The Gators climbed back in the second half as they cut 
the deficit to 8-5 on two goals from junior attacker Ashley Bruns. The Tar Heels responded with two goals, but the Gators stuck around, as Cullen scored two straight and ju-nior midfielder Gabi Wiegand scored on a free-position shot to make it 10-8.
Cullen said that while the Gators were able to make a late 
push, it was the result of effort that should have been pres-ent earlier in the game.
“Even though we did end up getting a couple, it just wasn’t enough,” Cullen said. “We needed to have the inten-sity we ended up having in that last 10 minutes the whole game.”
In order to rebound from the loss to North Carolina, O’Leary said Florida must show a higher level of intensity the entire game. Last year, after a season-opening loss to the Tar Heels in Chapel Hill, the Gators responded by winning 14 games in a row.
“Our team is certainly dedicated to working hard,” 
O’Leary said. “They’re going to try their best to rebound back from this.” 16, ALLIGATOR §  TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2012
