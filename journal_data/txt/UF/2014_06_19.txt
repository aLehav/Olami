Law enforcement ofﬁ  cers leave the Spanish Trace Apartment complex on Windmeadows Boulevard after it was cleared to be 
safe Wednesday afternoon. A man allegedly shot two people and then himself.

In a joint effort by multiple law enforce-
ment divisions, ofﬁ  cers were able to act swiftly 
to protect most residents at a Spanish Trace 
Apartments shooting situation that ended with an alleged suicide. 
Around 3 p.m. Wednes-
day, a Gainesville Police De-
partment ofﬁ  cer responded to Spanish Trace Apartments 
at 3500 Windmeadows Blvd. 
for a call placed in relation 
to alleged noise complaints, 
according to a GPD press re-lease. 
Kim Walsh, a resident of 
the neighboring apartment complex Regency Oaks Apartments, said she witnessed females 
being dragged away, one of whom was wear-
ing a bathing suit. 
Upon arrival, the ofﬁ  cer spoke with some 
involved parties on the second ﬂ  oor when he heard gunshots in Apartment 11 on the ﬁ  rst 
ﬂ  oor.  
The ofﬁ  cer ran down and found the female 
and male victims, later found to be a 21-year-
old and a 24-year-old, respectively, running 
from the ﬁ  rst ﬂ  oor apartment with obvious 
gunshot wounds in the arm and chest, accord-ing to a press release.
Ali Richter, a 21-year-old UF English ma-
jor and resident of Spanish Trace Apartments, said she was in her apartment all day when the 
incident started. 
She noticed cops were either escorting resi-
dents out of their apartments or commanding Spanish Trace shooting suspect injures two, self

Property owners in Gainesville should ex-
pect to see a reduction in their ﬁ  re insurance 
bill in September. 
Gainesville Fire Rescue has improved its 
classiﬁ  cation by the Insurance Service Ofﬁ  ce. 
It will go from a Class 3 to a Class 2, effec-
tive Sept. 1. The scale is from one to 10, with one being the best public protection in ﬁ  re-protection capability and 10 indicating that there is no recognized protection.
This could mean more money in the pock-
ets of property owners because insurance agencies use this information to set insurance rates for houses and buildings.  
“The city commission has supported mak-ing improvements so the ﬁ  re station can per-form at an optimal level, and the ISO rating 
reﬂ  ects that,” said Mayor Ed Braddy. 
The insurance ofﬁ  ce rates on three prima-
ry areas: response time, quality of equipment 
and quality of training.
According to the insurance ofﬁ  ce’s web-
site, GFR is one of 40 departments with that rating out of 682 in Florida.
Fire Chief Gene Prince said that numer-
ous factors improved GFR’s rating, but said 
he thinks the biggest factors were adding Fire 
Station No. 8 in 2011 and hiring 16 new ﬁ  re-
ﬁ  ghters. 
“We’ve been held up to the light, and 
we’re doing pretty good,” he said.
Prince said the new rates will reﬂ  ect the 
best practices that the ﬁ  re department uses in 
its delivery of services.
“At the end of the day, I think that’s what 
our citizens want to know,” he said. GNV ﬁ  re rescue rated higher

Florida Prepaid tuition plan prices 
are expected to drop nearly $20,000 by 
next year, according to the Florida Pre-paid College Board.
The lowered rate is mandated by 
House Bill 851, which Gov. Rick Scott signed into law last week and will go into effect July 1. It is the same bill that legalized in-state tuition for undocu-mented immigrants in Florida. 
The Stanley G. Tate Florida Prepaid 
College Program payment plan allows parents or guardians to ﬁ  nance a child’s 
college tuition early by paying monthly 
installments as the child grows up. 
More than 11,600 UF students re-ceived awards from the program in the 2012-2013 year, said UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes. 
Cindy Lorenzo, a 21-year-old UF 
biology senior, said she’s thankful her parents started investing in her early.
“I’ve been paying it for so long that 
the weight of college tuition isn’t so heavy on me,” she said. 
Now, Lorenzo said, it’s even less of 
a burden.
Students currently receiving aid will 
be reimbursed or credited the difference in aid, while future students enrolled in Florida Prepaid will simply pay a lower 
ticket price from the start. 
Lorenzo said if she receives the mon-
ey in the form of a refund, she will still Florida Prepaid prices drop,

Librarian Jean Hunt, 59, conducts an experiment using a raw and boiled egg at the High Springs Library 
on Tuesday afternoon. The science class is a part of the summer reading program. 
Monthly payments will drop to $250
use it for its intended purpose.
“I would use it to contribute 
toward my graduate school,” she 
said.
The fee reductions are an at-
tempt to combat the trend of tu-ition hikes that have been growing since 2008, when the state enacted a law allowing universities to raise tuition up to 15 percent above the state-mandated rate. 
“We are the largest and longest 
running prepaid program in the nation,” Florida Prepaid College 
Board executive director Kevin 
Thompson said in a press release. 
He said this legislation will 
make sure the program continues to keep that title.
Specifically, HB851 eliminates 
any increase in fees charged above the state-mandated rate for state universities excluding UF and Florida State University, whose 
fee increases are now limited to 6 
percent above the state standard. 
According to the Florida 
Prepaid College Board, 4-Year Florida University Plans and 2+2 
Florida Plans purchased from the 
contract year 2011 to 2014, as well as Tuition Differential Fee Plans purchased from the contract year 2008 to 2014 will now cost lower than they have in five years. 
Monthly payments for new 
contracts are estimated at $250, 
down from $350. 
Those estimates will become concrete Oct. 15, when open en-
rollment officially begins. 
This is good news, said 22-
year-old UF advertising senior Maria Eisenhart. 
She said the decision of wheth-
er to sign up for Florida Prepaid has been hard for some of her friends. 
“My best friend got it for her 
niece,” she said.
But she said her friend has two 
nieces and had to choose between the two. 
Now she will likely be able to 
afford to pay for both, she said.
Eisenhart said she plans to do 
the same for her future children. 
“You don’t know what situ-
ation you’ll be in financially as a 
parent, or what the child will be 
in.” With Prepaid, she said, “at least they have, like, one step in the door.”prep Aid , from page 1

Gainesville Police arrested a 
local man on Tuesday for stor-
ing nearly 3 ounces of cocaine in his pockets and underwear and running from officers.   
Officers arrested 38-year-old 
Xavier Queyonta Hill on charg-es of trafficking cocaine, resist-ing an officer with violence and possessing marijuana, accord-ing to an arrest report.
On Tuesday at about 7 p.m., 
Gainesville Police officers made a traffic stop on a car that had 
an expired registration date. An 
officer approached Hill on the passenger side of the car.Hill voluntarily exited the 
car and then attempted to run. The officer ran after him, grab-bing his shirt. Hill pulled away, 
losing his shirt.
After being stunned, Hill 
was then found with 3 ounces 
of powder cocaine, according to the report. 
Officers found one bag in 
Hill’s shorts pocket and two 
others in his underwear. 
After questioning, Hill ad-
mitted to owning the 1 gram of 
marijuana inside the car. How-ever, he did not make any state-ments regarding the cocaine, according to the report.
Officers booked Hill into 
the Alachua County Jail at 
about 8 p.m. on Tuesday. As 
of press time, his bond is set at $120,000.Man arrested with 
cocaine in underwear
Suspect was found dead
residents to stay inside, shouting, 
“Do you want to die? Get in your 
apartment!”
The officer heard another gun-
shot as he was getting the victims 
to safety at Oaks Pawn and Jewelry to be treated for wounds by EMS. 
Both victims, who were evacu-
ated and transported to a local hos-
pital, suffered non-life threatening 
injuries, GPD spokesman Ben To-bias wrote in an email.   
The shooter, later identified as 
48-year-old Lorenzo Fitzpatrick, retreated back into Apartment 11, allegedly still armed with a hand-
gun but no hostages. 
Multiple divisions of GPD, in-
cluding K-9, SWAT and the Ne-gotiation Response Team, arrived 
with the help of Alachua County Sheriff’s Office and U.S. Marshals 
Florida Fugitive Task Force, ac-
cording to a press release.
Around 6 p.m., SWAT was able 
to slow the situation down to plan 
their approach, where police be-
lieved the shooter was contained in one of several apartments, Tobias 
wrote in a GPD Facebook update.
Around 6:30 p.m., officers un-
successfully attempted to make di-rect contact with the suspect.
Gainesville SWAT officers, 
with assistance from ASO SWAT, formed a response team that ulti-
mately cleared the interior of the apartment, where Fitzpatrick was 
found dead at about 6:50 p.m., ac-
cording to a press release.
A handgun was lying near the 
body, leading investigators to be-lieve Fitzpatrick turned the gun on himself.Shooter , from page 1“I would use it to

June 23-27, but limited services will be 
available for university athletes.
The patient rooms and lobby are 
undergoing renovations to update the 
building, said Catherine Seemann, com-
munications coordinator for the SHCC.
The renovations started June 6 with 
the basement of the infirmary, and the renovations will continue in phases. 
The center is also adding a rubber 
runner on the wheelchair ramp to add traction and assist students, she said. 
The renovations, including design 
and construction, will cost $375,000, wrote the UF spokesman Steve Orlando in an email. 
General medical services will be 
available at the UF Health Shands Satel-
lite Clinic in the Student Health Science 
Center. 
Information about the clinic will be available on the outside of the building 
in the information tubes.
“This shouldn’t affect students,” 
Seemann said. “The only disruption is 
break week.”
The pharmacy is open in an alternate 
opening in the back of the building, and students can take RTS or GOTCHA ride with a Gator 1 Card to UF Health Shands Satellite Clinic. Clinic closes for renovation

Juan Arboleda was searching for his pro-

Arboleda, a 19-year-old UF microbiology 
and cell science sophomore, looked online, 
but found nothing.
He wandered around the genetics lab 
until a security guard guided him to his des-tination.
Students facing a similar dilemma have a 
solution in UF’s newly updated directory.
Starting June 25, the new-look UF Direc-
tory will replace the online UF Phonebook, launched in 2008. 
When the original program was launched, 
mobile devices did not have the capability to perform complicated searches or the com-puting power necessary to conduct searches for such a large database, Tracy Gale, UF’s Information Technology communications manager, wrote in an email. 
“As with all technology, advances in pro-
gramming and capabilities require service upgrades,” Gale said.
The updated directory provides a less 
cluttered interface that will be responsive to desktops, laptops and mobile devices. Just this year, about 70,000 people have used the UF Phonebook, according to the UFIT web-site. 
Jacolyn Mitchelson, the Innovation Acad-
emy’s senior secretary, uses the online UF Phonebook often to locate staff and faculty 
on campus.
When using the updated UF Directory, 
she was able to locate a name she did not 
find in the current version of the phone-book.

look UF Directory through a link located on the current Directory-UF Phonebook web-site, directory.ufl.edu.UF Phonebook gets facelift,

On Tuesday, we took an ofﬁ  cial stance on the anti-
abortion bill that Gov. Rick Scott signed: We are pa-tently against the governor’s actions on this partic-
ular issue. Scott continues to make controversial moves as election season draws closer. Tampa Bay Times columnist John Romano called out the governor in yesterday’s paper, highlighting his skeezy policy of only allowing TV inter-
views if his public relations reps are allowed to hand-pick 
the subjects, questions, reporters “and, presumably, ferns.”
Scott, Romano went on to argue, has made inaccessibil-
ity his thing — kind of like the way President Franklin D. Roosevelt made ﬁ  reside chats a thing, except what Scott’s 
doing is slimy and cowardly. Yeah, we know darting Scott 
is liking shooting a bald, dead-eyed ﬁ  sh in a barrel at this point, but we’re tossing a this-is-not-how-you-get-re-elect-
ed DART at Scott. 
Off a throw-in pass, the U.S. soccer team sent our hearts 
soaring within the ﬁ  rst minute of its debut in the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Jermaine Jones passed to Clint Dempsey at the U.S. vs. Ghana match on Monday for a 1-0 lead. Ghana re-sponded in the 82nd minute, and the U.S. countered with a 
header goal to eventually win the game 2-1. This comes as 
a redemption win to our futbol boys as Ghana knocked the U.S. out of the 2006 World Cup in Germany and the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, respectively. We’re kicking a 
don’t-call-it-a-comeback LAUREL to the U.S. soccer team.   
The Sunshine State, as the nation knows, regularly 
churns out weird headlines depicting Florida folks doing 
crazy things. While we love to laugh at the strange news, not all of it is good. Florida achieved a new level of notori-
ety  yesterday when the state performed its 43rd execution 
by lethal injection in 14 years — an extremely steep rate. 
Florida has a dirty history when it comes to executions. 
In 2006, the state botched a lethal injection: A procedure 
that should have taken 10 minutes took half an hour when 
the executioner assigned to kill convicted murderer Angel Diaz “pushed catheters through both veins and into subcu-taneous soft tissue,” according to CBS Miami. Then-Gov. Jeb Bush put a moratorium on lethal injections, but that 
moratorium was lifted in 2007 by then-Gov. Charlie Crist. 
Florida has also had severe problems with electrocutions in the past. 
This is truly a frightening problem, and it’s indicative of 
a fractured justice system. The death penalty should be a last resort, and furthermore, shouldn’t be performed at all if it’s done incorrectly. This week, we’re throwing an it’s-
time-for-real-change DART at the Florida Department of 
Corrections.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgFriday’s question: Are you worried about 
paying off your student loans? Today’s question: Did you get stuck in the Northwest 
34th Street shooting trafﬁ  c? Time to reﬂ  ect on history of Iraq War
Iraq, a country that for mind-boggling reasons the U.S. in-
vaded in 2003, is in a state of disarray. In recent weeks, a terrorist group known as the Islamic State of Iraq and 
Syria has taken control over large swaths of the country, in-cluding Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city.
Here at home, politicians and foreign policy experts are 
trying to ﬁ  nd a way to solve the growing crisis — ISIS now has a foothold in both Iraq and its neighbor Syria — and in the process, continue to toss political barbs.
After all, someone must be blamed for the disaster in Iraq, 
and it most certainly can’t be former President George W. Bush, who was decider-in-chief when we invaded in 2003. 
Let’s be very clear: The entire destabilization of the Middle 
East started with Bush’s inane 2003 invasion of a sovereign 
country without any provocation. This testament to macho 
behavior cost the lives of nearly 4,500 American men and women in service and tens of thousands of Iraqis at a cost of $1.7 trillion.
In 2008, Bush ﬁ  nally decided that it was time to end his 
adventuring in Iraq and signed an agreement that would pull all remaining U.S. forces from the country by 2011. President Barack Obama followed through on that agreement, leaving Iraqis in charge of their own future. 
As demonstrated by recent events, control was a word 
used rather loosely by Iraqi ofﬁ  cials. The rest of this column could focus on the sectarian warfare between Sunni and Shi-ite Muslims, but instead, let’s talk about history. 
If you’re an undergrad at UF, chances are you were in 
elementary school when we invaded Iraq, so here’s some background information: After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the Bush administration made it clear without com-pelling evidence that Iraq was responsible for the attacks, 
and we were going to rid the world of Saddam Hussein, 
Iraq’s despotic leader. Americans were told that Saddam was stockpiling weapons of mass destruction, and the clock had run out on his reign. 
It was time for some shock and awe, American style.Most of Congress — and sadly, the American people — 
agreed with Bush. In March of 2003, the U.S. launched a full-scale invasion of a sovereign country that had nothing to do with 9/11 and, turned out, had no WMDs. 
Oops! Bush declared mission accom-
plished just six weeks later, but 
in reality, our mission was just 
beginning. Iraq devolved into chaos following the eradication of Saddam’s government and Sadd-am himself, and we spent nearly a 
decade caught in the middle of a civil war between Sunnis and Shiites. 
Now, after Bush’s eight-year excursion spreading democ-
racy in Iraq, the Sunnis forced out of power by the U.S.-led 
invasion of 2003 imperil the country’s democratic govern-
ment and could ignite a larger, regional war based on sectar-ian lines. 
According to some, this is Obama’s fault because he fol-
lowed through with Bush’s 2008 agreement. In fact, cable news is putting many former Bush administration ofﬁ  cials on the airwaves so the American people can hear the views of those that nonsensically invaded a country 11 years ago. 
The American people should be outraged. 
You were led into war under false pretenses by a group 
of people who now blame the mess in Iraq squarely on the

How convenient?The U.S. is in a no-win scenario with Iraq, and with that 
in mind, it’s ﬁ  nally time for all of us to stand up and say that invading Iraq was one of the greatest foreign policy and mili-tary blunders in American history. 
The costs to our country and those who served were too 
great, and the results were painfully predictable. Instead of playing the blame game, let’s remember our history, and for once, learn from it. 
Who knows? It may save the lives of future men and 
women in the U.S. Military.

Lana Del Rey’s career skyrock-
eted with her 2012 release, “Born to 
Die,” where she wrote songs of love, heartbreak and alcohol addiction at an early age. The album had strong hip-hop influence in its quick-tempo production and moments of rap from Del Rey on songs like “National An-them” and “Diet Mountain Dew.” While her latest record, “Ultravio-lence,” doesn’t vary much in lyrical content, it is a bigger, more cinematic experience than her previous effort thanks to the change in production and attention to Del Rey’s voice.
The new album’s first four tracks 
take more than 22-and-a-half min-utes to complete, but Del Rey’s vo-cals aren’t rushed, and the pain and beauty in her voice can lay out over the background production (“Shades of Cool” and “Ultraviolence”). There isn’t much hip-hop influence in the album, with the exception of “West Coast,” and Del Rey takes on a heavi-er soul/blues angle to the way she sings her songs (evident on the al-bum’s final song, “The Other Wom-an,” a Nina Simone cover), which al-lows for her painstakingly beautiful voice to shine through. Rather than catch up with the music, she displays her emotions of love, backstabbing and heartbreak over the music with-out sounding hurried, which is heav-ily influenced by the main producer of the album, Dan Auerbach, who is the lead singer of the blues rock band The Black Keys. “Ultraviolence” doesn’t have many up-tempo mo-ments — most of “Born to Die” was quick in tempo with the exception of “Video Games” and “Radio” — but Del Rey’s drawn out, cinematic vo-cals sound better over the slower-paced, rock/jazz production.
On “Pretty When You Cry,” Del 
Rey sings with a soft voice, “All those little times you said that I’m your girl, you make me feel like your whole world,” before the spacious guitars and slow-paced drums allow her to belt, “I’m pretty when I cry,” speaking to her lover’s enjoyment of seeing her cry. Lyrics like this are much more difficult to swallow when they’re repeated over choruses 
and guitar solos rather than cut off by 
another verse.
“Ultraviolence” is far more in-
triguing sonically than “Born to Die,” 
which allows the lyrics to stand out 
more than the upbeat and, at times, 
fun production on her previous al-
bum. It’s never easy to listen to peo-ple unleash their emotions (unless your Del Rey’s lover from “Pretty When You Cry”), and “Ultravio-lence” doesn’t make it any easier. But 
as an artist, Del Rey improved in her 
delivery and sound from her previ-
ous record and made “Ultraviolence” a beautiful record to listen to.

The L.A.-via-Gainesville electro-
indie group Hundred Waters will 
perform at the High Dive on June 27 at 9 p.m. Tickets can be purchased for $10 online, at Hear Again Music and Movies or the High Dive box office and are $12 at the door. Hun-dred Waters’ tour comes off the tails of the release of “The Moon Rang Like a Bell,” which dropped on May 27 under Skrillex’s record la-bel,  OWSLA. The Alligator caught up with electronics/guitarist and former UF architecture major Paul Giese for a brief Q&A.
You guys are returning to 
Gainesville this month. Will you be revisiting any places where you used to hang out?
We’ll probably grab some La 
Tienda immediately when we en-ter the city limits, and then after the show, we’ll probably grab a cup of coffee from Volta.
Speaking of Gainesville, I read 
in the feature SPIN did on you this week about something called Bro Island, a warehouse space you used to practice and perform in—
Oh my gosh (laughs). That’s so 
embarrassing.
So can you tell me more about 
Bro Island?
Basically it’s a little house that’s 
right behind El Indio, that taco place, and we came in at a time when the subsidized housing that used to be surrounding that area was all being demolished.
It used to be a grocery store and 
then a dojo and all these things — and it’s still there — I think it’s kind of fratty now. But it was great. It had a gi-ant yard that was 
fenced in, so we could throw shows there. There were giant rooms and concrete floors, so we could be loud and experiment. We recorded the first album; we threw a lot of shows there. We had a lot of great forma-tive times there. It became a great little piece of the Gainesville music scene at that time.
In what ways has Hundred Wa-
ters’ sound changed since those early days and now with “The Moon Rang Like a Bell?”
It’s hard to quantify those sub-
conscious things that make you do something a certain way. With art and music, it’s hard to set a goal and then just have it be achieved and check a box. Ideologies change, so it’s a tough question — the lis-tener might be able to answer best.
Reviewers throw around so 
many different words to describe Hundred Waters, and it’s not like the other acts on Skrillex’s label. How would you personally de-scribe your sound?
There’s all sorts of fun things 
people use to describe us, and it’s always interesting for us to read them — things like folktronica, or like, synth-pop.
It’s hard to describe, from our 
point of view. We just make it with our ways of making it, and it just ends up being what it is. It’s always a tough thing; like when we’re at a gas station on tour and a car pulls up next to us and they’re like, “You’re in a band! What type of music do you make?”
We’ve been having that question 
posed to us for two years, and ev-erytime it gets asked we all just lock up and chuckle because we don’t know what to say. We usually just say something silly, like Christian dubstep or something.

Americans love cookbooks, 
and this is especially apparent 
in recent years. In 1961, 49 cook-books were published. In 2001, more than 1,700 were published, 
with an astounding 530 million 
books on food and alcohol sold in the U.S. in 2000. Furthermore, cookbooks are the only genre of print books to maintain sales after 9/11 and to increase in sales dur-ing the 2009 recession. 
Yet, we are in an era dedicated 
to convenience and time-saving 
meals, devoting less time to cook-
ing. More people are buying meals and bringing them home, eating out or eating in the car. In fact, 30 percent of eating in the U.S. is now done in cars, with the 7-Elev-en chain introducing “dashboard dining,” foods that are designed for convenient car consumption. 
Thus, an initial question arises: 
Are we reading cookbooks more than cooking from them? If so, are cookbooks teaching readers more than culinary skills?
A way to answer that is to look 
at the discourse offered in cook-books, particularly cookbooks written by celebrity chefs. Since 2004, more than half of the top 25 best-selling general cookbooks sold on Amazon.com Inc. are cookbooks written by celebrity chefs, speciﬁ  cally stars from the television channel Food Network. Curious about this phenomenon, 
scholar Christine Mitchell ex-
plores the rhetoric of ﬁ  ve celebrity cookbooks, questioning whether the cookbooks have culinary val-ue or serve more as promotional 
material for the stars. Compar-ing cookbooks by Rachael Ray, 
Emeril Lagasse, 
Bobby Flay, Sara Moulton and the grande 
dame, Julia Child, Mitchell ﬁ  nds that much of the difference among the cookbooks in their instructional intent depends on gender. By looking at the rhetoric 
on the covers, introductions, im-
ages, recipes and endorsements, Mitchell suggests that the women concentrated on teaching read-ers about cooking as a practice to develop and continue, while the men’s cookbooks are more pro-motional material, focusing on their personal likes, dislikes and 
restaurants.Is it that women, like their 
American predecessors — Ame-
lia Simmons in the ﬁ  rst genuine American cookbook in 1796 and inﬂ  uential Fannie Farmer in her 1896 “Boston Cooking-School Cook Book” — will continue to 
be the real teachers in the kitchen? 
There is no doubt that there are female celebrity chefs who covet and have earned the limelight — Giada de Laurentiis comes to mind — nor can we overlook men who have inﬂ  uenced the culinary habits of American home cooks. James Beard, Craig Claiborne 
and Mark Bittman are among the 
greats. The ultimate test for a ce-lebrity cookbook is determining whether the venture would have a chance of standing on its own as a cookbook, or literary effort, had the celebrity sent it to the pub-lisher under an unknown name. Some will be used more in the 
kitchen than others, regardless of 
gender.
See Toby Miller’s (2007) “Cul-
tural citizenship: Cosmopolitan-ism, Consumerism, and Televi-sion in a Neoliberal Age” and Christine Mitchell’s (2010) “The Rhetoric of Celebrity Cookbooks” in “The Journal of Popular Cul-
ture.”
Are celebrity cookbooks ‘culinary’?Food

“Patti Smithereens,” No. 86, 
fought her way through the pack 
of women as she was met with crushing shoulder shoves and hips knocking her every which way.
The moment she broke through 
the crowd of skaters she picked up her pace, speeding around the track only to endure it all over again.
The name of the game is roller 
derby. One track, eight women on roller skates and nothing but ac-tion.
On Saturday, the Gainesville 
Roller Rebels, Gainesville’s ﬁ  rst and only competitive women’s ﬂ  at-track roller derby league, battled the Fort Myers Derby Girls at the Alachua County Fairgrounds in the ﬁ  rst home game of the summer.
Spectators paid $10 for a ticket 
and scoured around for the perfect spot to set up their camping chairs.
“These things get pretty in-
tense,” said Veronica Almeida, a 23-year-old UF alumna. “Last game I went to, two girls broke their arms and just got back up and kept play-ing.”
There are rules against certain 
blocking techniques to protect play-ers from major injuries, but essen-tially, being rough is the highlight of the game.
The stampede of women skaters 
in ﬁ  shnet panty hose and bright, silver spandex blocked and shoved 
each other left and right for an hour 
and a half. The derby ended with the unofﬁ  cial score of 109 to 274.
Although Gainesville lost by 
more than 100 points, the skaters didn’t let that get in their way of celebrating the game. 
Rounding up both teams, the 
skaters picked up cups of beer and 
toasted to a good time when the 
game came to an end. 
Christina Cates, the Gainesville 
Roller Rebels vice president, said bouts are intense, but players usu-ally have no hard feelings in the end. They make jokes and have a good laugh up until that starting whistle blows, and then it’s game 
on, she said. 
The team has six games sched-
uled for the rest of the year, and the 
next home derby is scheduled for Aug. 2.
The Gainesville Roller Rebels 
are also looking for more women to join their team and will hold a three-day boot camp for $30 start-
ing July 13.Roller Rebels Roll On10, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 19, 2014

With mobile dating apps on the 
rise, a new company is offering a 
new take on the nature of creating fast relationships by encouraging members to involve family and 
friends in the process.
MiXOXO developed an app 
called XOXO to combine social net-
working and dating services by al-lowing members to include email addresses for people to include in their group before entering poten-tial partner preferences.  It has been available since April 9.
The app takes a step away from 
the hookup culture behind other popular dating apps. Ethan Wein-stein, CEO , said he hopes it will al-low users to learn more information about both new and current friends.
One ﬂ  aw of dating apps is not 
having a good algorithm that calcu-lates a match-making function using 
a speciﬁ  c process, he said. MiXOXO 
created an algorithm based on 12 questions to group users based on compatibility.
“We have made the experience of 
meeting people fun and interactive, and the 12 questions make it as real life as possible,” Weinstein said.
The app also moves away from 
using GPS locator information and group users in larger regions to in-troduce them to people outside of their immediate area.
Kyle Miller, a 19-year-old UF ﬁ  -
nance freshman, said that the app is a good innovation of the traditional dating app. Adding social network-ing is a good idea to attract more us-
ers. 
“I’ve always found it easier to 
meet people when I have one or two 
friends around,” Miller said.
While the app may offer safety 
in numbers, some people may still be turned off due to the reputation of dating apps. Itarah Godbolt, a 21-year-old dance senior at UF, is 
skeptical about the safety of possible 
interactions.
“I ﬁ  nd dating apps creepy be-cause I feel they have a potential to be dangerous,” she said.
While adding social media 
wouldn’t change her views, the company is using a creative market-ing strategy, she said.
“They are doing something a 
little bit different. They are tapping into the trend of social media and speaking to their audience.”
It takes less than 30 seconds to 
create a proﬁ  le on the app, and it’s open for people of all ages, sexual orientations and relationship sta-tuses to use.  The app only has a few hundred users so far, but Weinstein 
hopes it will become an internation-
al product.
To access MiXOXO’s app for free, 
download it from the app store and enter the code “XO” during the sign-up process. Each member you sign up with will receive his or her own code offering a discount on the typi-cal membership plan.  Prices range 
from $8.33 to $39.99 per month, de-
pending on the plan’s length and how many members you sign up.

Gainesville Fashion Week 
will be holding a runway show 
at The Enclave Apartments on June 28 that will feature sum-mer and resort-wear trends. 
Down by the pool at The En-
clave is where the runway will be.
The lineup of swimwear 
and resort wear will be from local boutiques Wolfgang Gainesville, FreeRide Surf and Skate Shop and also Target.
This free event is not only 
a fashion show, but a way to bring the community together, said Ching-Ya Ni, co producer of the show. 
This is the second GFW 
summer show— set apart from the ﬁ  rst by live performances, which will include pole danc-ing mixed with yoga by Jacque-
line Valdez.“This will not be trashy pole 
dancing but, entertaining, to say 
the least,” Ni said. Not only will there be pole dancing, but also ﬁ  re-spinning and hula-hooping by Alice Nimmo. 
Sixth Street Station will style 
hair to be laid-back or beach-sexy. Makeup for the models will be done by the Ulta team and a freelance makeup artist named Justine Smith.
Music will be provided by 
Swamp Records’ Bells and Ropes. Refreshments include alcohol for those of age pro-
vided by Alligator Brewing 
Company.
Katherine Arellano, a 20-
year-old resident of The En-clave Apartments, is excited for this event to happen especially because it is right outside her window.
“I mean, I already have so 
many bikinis, but I am always open to suggestions,” she said.See swimwear soonTHURSDAY, JUNE 19, 2014

� SHAFER WAS THE FIRST 
TO SIGN WITH A MLB TEAM.

Since right-handed pitcher 
Justin Shafer signed with the To-
ronto Blue Jays on June 10, two 
more Gators have decided to go 
pro.
Juniors Taylor Gushue and 
Casey Turgeon opted to forgo 
their ﬁ  nal year of eligibility at UF 
after signing with the Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Cardinals, respectively.
After being drafted in the 
fourth round of the MLB Draft, Gushue begins his pro career with the Jamestown Jammers of the Class A Short-Season New 
York-Penn League. Through ﬁ  ve 
games, the catcher has a .364 bat-ting clip with four home runs and nine RBIs.
During his three-year tenure 
at Florida, Gushue started 162 games and posted a career .273 batting average with 16 home runs and 103 RBIs.
In 2014, the catcher led the 
Gators in hits (71), doubles (16), home runs (six), RBIs (49) and slugging percentage (.467) while being second on the team with a 
career-high .316 batting average. 
Gushue paced the Southeastern Conference in league play with a .389 clip at the plate and was tied 
for third with 41 hits en route to 
ﬁ  rst-team All-SEC and second-team All-America honors.
With Gushue’s departure, 
Florida has several options for 
his replacement behind the plate. 
Rising seniors Braden Mattson and Mike Fahrman — who com-bined for 10 starts at catcher last season — are still on the roster. 
Catcher commit JJ Schwarz, a 
2014 Perfect Game ﬁ  rst-team All-American from Palm Beach Gar-dens High in West Palm Beach, 
Fla., provides another option.

The 2014 NBA Draft is a 
week away and the top of the 
draft board is beginning to take shape.
The consensus top three 
picks for the draft according to a compilation of mock drafts by NBA.com are a trio of fresh-men: Kansas center Joel Embiid, Duke shooting forward Jabari Parker and Kansas shooting forward Andrew Wiggins. In fact, eight of the top 14 picks are projected to be freshmen, while 
just one senior — Creighton’s 
Doug McDermott, a three-time ﬁ  rst-team All-American and the 2014 National Player of the Year — is expected to be taken with one of those top picks.
But while the top of the 
draft starts to show some signs 
of certainty, projecting where 
former Florida players will be drafted still remains an uncer-tainty.
Patric Young is the lone UF 
athlete consistently showing up on draft boards. Young, who 
measured in at 6-foot-10 and 
247 pounds at the NBA Com-bine, is the No. 34 overall pros-pect and No. 3 center according to ESPN’s Chad Ford.
Although ESPN ranks 
Young as a late-ﬁ  rst round pick, most mock drafts slate the former Gators center and Jack-
sonville native as a mid-second 
round selection.Young, the 2014 Southeast-
ern Conference Defensive Play-
er of the Year and an honorable 
mention AP All-American, paced the Gators with 41 blocks while ranking 12th in the SEC with 6.2 rebounds per game. He ﬁ  nished his UF career as the 11th player in Gators history to ﬁ  nish his career with at least 1300 points and 800 rebounds.
F e l l o w 
Florida play-ers Scottie Wilbekin and 
Casey Prath-er, the No. 74 and No. 95 prospects on Ford’s 
Top 100 list, 
could squeeze in as late second 
round picks but are likely to go undrafted. 
Wilbekin was the 2014 SEC 
Player of the Year and a third-team All-American after av-eraging 13.1 points per game and led the Gators with 3.6 
assists per game and 56 steals 
in a team-best 34 minutes per contest, but off-the-ﬁ  eld issues could leave teams hesitant of drafting him.
Prather, who averaged just 
3.1 points per game in his ﬁ  rst three years with Florida, led the Gators in his senior campaign 
with 13.8 points per contest and 
paced the SEC with a .603 shoot-ing clip. The ﬁ  rst-team All-SEC selection also set career-highs NBA Draft Preview:

Appealing to Washington Redskins 
owner Daniel Snyder’s pathos was never going to work. You can make 
commercials and documentaries that tug on the heartstrings and you can even use sur-veys to get your point across that the nick-name is offensive, but you weren’t going to 
get through to him.Finally, an ini-
tial step has been 
taken to crack the cocoon of ig-
norance that sur-
rounds the or-ganization in a tangible way: they 
indirectly came af-
ter its owner’s wallet.
The United States Patent and Trademark 
Ofﬁ  ce cancelled six trademarks held by the Washington Redskins on Wednesday under 
the grounds that, “they were disparaging to Native Americans at the respective times they were registered.”
This sets up the worst nightmare for Sny-
der: someone else proﬁ  ting off of the offen-sive term — reserved for that of the scalped heads of Native Americans — that doubles 
as the nickname for his football team. Much 
like Clippers’ owner Donald Sterling, the exact amount of money taken from him isn’t the point. Let’s be honest, the $2.5 million ﬁ  ne from the NBA to Sterling is a drop in the bucket. Just like the chunk of revenue faux jersey makers and others looking  to proﬁ  t from the Redskins name won’t be tak-
ing out an overwhelming majority of licens-
ing revenue. It may be enough, however, for Snyder to decide whether another name could be more lucrative because it would 
have the same ﬁ  nancial viability and trade-
mark protection as the other 31 teams.

Without a doubt, the University of 
Florida is a football school. It has been and it will continue to be the 
school’s focus in athletics.
But in a year when the football program re-
corded its worst season since 1979, the rest of Florida athletics stepped up to bring national recognition to Gainesville. Today, we at al-ligatorSports honor the best of the best from Gators sports over the past year. We have cho-sen the ﬁ  ve most memorable games from the 2013-2014 season.
Here’s the kicker: You decide which one 
wins. Vote online at alligator.org/sports.
Without further ado, here’s the list of the 
best games in no particular order.
Florida vs. Kentucky (men’s basketball)
 Result: UF 61-60
The Southeastern Conference Tournament 
ﬁ  nal pitted the Gators and Wildcats against one another for the third time in the 2013-2014 season.
With just more than 11 minutes on the clock 
and down by 15, the Wildcats proceeded to go on a 21-7 run to cut the Gators’ lead to 61-60 with 1:31 left in the game.After Scottie Wil-
bekin and Dorian Finney-Smith each missed free throws with fewer than 
30 seconds to go, 
UK had a chance to jump ahead and capture the SEC Tournament on the ﬁ  nal possession.
However, when James Young had an open 
lane, he slipped and lost possession of the ball to secure Florida’s ﬁ  rst SEC Tournament 
championship since 2007.
Florida vs. Alabama (softball)  
Result: UF 6-3
In Game 2 of the Women’s College World 
Series Championship, UF rocked Bama’s Ja-
clyn Traina for ﬁ  ve runs off six hits in just 1.1 innings.
Senior Hannah Rogers, who threw a four-
hit shutout in the Gators’ Game 1 victory, closed out the ﬁ  nal two innings to earn the save in Florida’s ﬁ  rst championship in the pro-gram’s 18-year history.UF had made it to the WCWS Champion-
ship twice before in 2009 and 2011, but the Gators were swept both times.
Florida vs. Northwestern (lacrosse)
 Result: UF 9-8
In the American Lacrosse Conference 
championship game, Florida faced rival 
Northwestern. The two schools butted heads 
once at the end of Florida’s 12-2 regular season 
and it was Northwestern’s opportunity to take the second win.
The Wildcats came out with a solid game 
leading the Gators 7-2 at halftime, but Florida managed to hold Northwestern to just one point in the second half while the Gators put the ball in the back of the net seven times to 
win 9-8. UF captured the ALC title for the sec-
ond year in a row.
Florida vs. Georgetown (w. basketball)  
Result: UF 67-65
Despite not leading for the entire game, the 
Gators overcame a 16-point halftime deﬁ  cit to shock the Hoyas. After tying the game at 58 at the end of regulation, Florida quickly took its ﬁ  rst lead of the game on a three-point-play by senior Jaterra Bonds. 
With the UF lead down to 66-65, Bonds, 
who scored a career-high 26 points in the 
game, drove hard to the basket and completed 
one of two fouls to cement the Gators 67-75 comeback victory.    
Florida vs. Auburn (men’s basketball)
 Result: UF 71-66
Down 38-30 at the half, the Gators stormed 
back in the ﬁ  nal 20 minutes behind their four seniors and the clutch three-point shooting of sophomore Michael Frazier.
Patric Young scored all 17 of his points in 
the second half and went 7-for-9 at the free-throw line, including hitting three within the ﬁ  nal 20 seconds.
The Tigers had the opportunity to make 
their comeback down 68-66 but Allen Payne threw the inbound pass over the Gators’ bench to essentially seal UF’s 18th straight win.
With No. 1 Syracuse losing to unranked 
Boston College earlier that night, Florida’s victory against Auburn gave Billy Donovan’s squad the top ranking for the ﬁ  rst time since 2007.

in rebounds per game (5.0), as-
sists per game (1.6), total steals (37) and total blocks (20) in his ﬁ  nal collegiate season.
Since Florida won its last 
national championship in 2007, 11 former Gators have been drafted — ﬁ  ve were ﬁ  rst-round choices — with at least one UF player being selected in ev-ery draft with the exception of 2010.
UF’s 2007 draft class saw 
ﬁ  ve players — Al Horford 
(third), Corey Brewer (sev-
enth), Joakim Noah (ninth), Chris Richard (41st) and Tau-rean Green (52nd) — taken in the 60-pick draft, tying with the 2006 UConn class for the most players selected in one year until the 2012 draft when Ken-tucky had six players drafted.
By the time you read this, the 
Redskins will probably have al-
ready submitted an appeal of the decision. They may even win on a technicality like they did in 2003. That year, they won the appeal of 
a 1999 trademark cancellation de-
cision because the judge ruled that the plaintiffs who challenged the rule had waited too long after the 
original Trademark Act of 1946 to 
do so, and they also didn’t have enough evidence. The current suit — originally ﬁ  led in 2006 — that has resulted in cancellation hopes 
to dodge the former technicality 
because its plaintiffs were aged 18-24 at the time it was ﬁ  led. And they hope the evidence they’ve 
presented stands up against the 
latter.
The team released a statement 
that reads: “We’ve seen this story before. And just like last time, (yes-
terday’s) ruling will have no effect 
at all on the team’s ownership of and right to use the Redskins name and logo.” In other words: they’re conﬁ  dent the crutch they’ve used to offend millions will come through for them once more. The 
second part however, is technical-
ly correct, because until an appeal decision is handed down, the team still gets to act as if they have total 
ownerships of the trademark.
You wouldn’t call a team the 
Washington N*****s, a word load-
ed with centuries of oppression and hate, but still Washington’s 
NFL franchise ﬂ  ies in the face of 
common decency and even com-mon sense. It is a derogatory nick-name that has persevered because 
it took so long for so many of us 
to care.
It will change, it’s just a mat-
ter of time. Public opinion is al-ready on the side of the Native 
Americans that are so profoundly  
wounded by Snyder’s stubborn-ness. He isn’t changing the name until he absolutely has to, but if an 
appeals court does what many of 
us hope it will after the long pro-cess is complete, he may not have a choice.THURSDAY, JUNE 19, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 19

dinals in the 24th round, was 
assigned to the Johnson City  
Cardinals in the Rookie Appala-
chian League. The team opens its season today with a three-game series against the Blueﬁ  eld Blue

Turgeon started 185 games 
— including 177 at second base 
— during his three-year career at Florida, accruing a .269 batting 
average with 112 runs, 95 RBIs 
and 13 home runs. In his junior campaign, the Palm Harbor na-tive  paced the Gators with 35 walks while being second on the team with 36 runs, 33 RBIs, 11 doubles and four home runs.
Florida re-
turns ﬁ  ve play-ers who started d o u b l e - d i g i t contests in the 
inﬁ  eld in 2014 
— juniors Zack Powers, Josh To-bias and Matt-
son; sophomore Richie Martin; and freshmen Peter Alonso and John Sternagel. UF also has two inﬁ  eld commits — Dalton Guth-rie, a 2014 Perfect Game second-team All-American selection, and 2014 second-team All-Region se-lection Christian Hicks — who 
have experience playing second 
base.
Florida has three more play-
ers — pitchers Karsten Whitson (11th round, Botson Red Sox), 
Ryan Harris (26th round, Boston 
Red Sox) and Keenan Kish (34th round, Cincinnati Reds) — who were drafted but haven’t made 
a decision to go pro or remain at 
school. The deadline for a draft pick to sign with a team is July 18.
