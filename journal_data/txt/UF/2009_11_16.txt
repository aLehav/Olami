UF 24 SOUTH CAROLINA14
Florida finishes SEC slate perfect
* THE GATORS WON THEIR
20TH GAME IN A ROW.
By PHIL KEGLER

COLUMBIA, S.C. -It has rarely
been pretty, but the victory meals
keep on coming for Florida.
Urban Meyer won't let his team
forget it.
No. 1 UF's 24-14 win over South
Carolina on Saturday gave the
Gators 20 straight wins, good for
sixth in Southeastern Conference
history, as well as their first perfect
league record since 1996.
"Our team, we have victory
meals on Sunday nights," said
Meyer, whose .800 winning percent-
age in SEC games is now tops all-
time among coaches of at least five
years. "I can't tell you what we eat,
but when I hear 'victory meal' it's all
good.
"We did not play perfect, obvi-
ously. I'm not sure we've played
perfect in quite a while."
The offense left plenty of points
on the field -three missed field
goals and two would-be touch-
downs dropped by Riley Cooper
were the most obvious. The defense
struggled in the first half, allowing Harrison Diamond / Alligator Staff

"The goal is to raise aware-

said Theo Urbano, assistant di-

reason we decided on these spe-

More than 200 turn out
for Indian dance festival
Gainesville residents traded
in their jeans and T-shirts for sa-
ris and kurtas at Friday's Diwali
Dance Festival.
Pink, turquoise, purple and
gold saris draped women's bod-
ies as men wore embroidered
kurta shirts in subtler hues.
Guests were as colorful as the In-
dian culture they came to see.
The festival, hosted by UF's
Hindu Cultural Society, was
held in celebration of Diwali,
which is considered the New
Year to some parts of India, and
showcased Indian culture to 225
guests through dancing, singing
and beat boxing performances.

isfy their appetites with traditional
homemade Indian food such as sa-
mosas, gulab jamun and pay bhaji.
Pizza was available for those less
daring to sample the spicy dishes.
Onstage performances were
broken up by 45-minute intermis-
sions inwhichguests and members
of the Hindu Cultural Society took
to the center of the auditorium to
dance to blaring Indian music.
The lights were turned off, the
music turned up and only multi-
colored Christmas lights illumi-
nated the room.
People of all cultures and ages,
from children with pacifiers in
their mouths to men with gray
in their hair, were stomping their
feet swaying their bodies and
waving their arms in coordination
with the music.
Wearing a bright pink lehnga
dress and a big smile, Gainesville
resident Maghan McDowell fol-
lowed the dance moves everyone
around her was doing.
McDowell loved the food and
music, but her favorite part was
the outfit, a traditional Indian dress
her friend lent her, and getting to
put on cool Indian makeup.
At $3 a ticket, the event raised
about $1,000, all of which will be
donated. Some will go to Seva
Bharathi, an Indian NGO that car-
ries out relief work, for the recent
flood victims in India. Some will
go to the Gainesville Indian Cul-
tural and Education Center and
the rest will go to charities for edu-
cation.
"We really wanted to do some-
thing for the flood victims," Dip-
narine said. "Forty-five rupees
is $1, so you get an idea of how
much we can help."

About 35 people assembled
at the UF Commuter Lot on Gale
Lemerand Drive at about 8 a.m.
Sunday to run in the Paws for Pet
Rescue 5K.
The race benefited Haile's An-
gels Pet Rescue, a Gainesville
animal shelter that finds adoptive
homes for dogs and cats to prevent
them from being euthanized.
Before the race, participants
drank donated bottled water and
jumped in place to ward off the
early morning chill.
Officers from the University Po-
lice Department outlined the route,
which circled Lake Alice by way of
Mowry, Hull, Radio and Museum
roads.
Sasha, a tan and white 2-year-old
Basset Hound mix, greeted runners
at the finish line. She was brought
to Haile's Angels Pet Rescue aboutthree weeks ago and is awaiting
adoption.
Six students in UF professor
Stephen LaBarbera's sales manage-
ment class organized the event.
LaBarbera's class was split into
groups and assigned to raise aware-
ness for a pet rescue organization in
Alachua County, said Sara Palmer,
a marketing senior who helped co-
ordinate the race.

to group member Alex Baden, a UF
marketing and psychology senior.
Ariel, a 14-year-old student at
Oak Hall School, has volunteered at
the Alachua County Humane Soci-
ety for a year. She asked her parents
to join her in running for the cause.
"I run three miles a day any-

By ALISON SCHWARTZ
Alligator Writer
Chase Bissell didn't accidentally forget her
jacket Friday.
Although the weather was in the 60s, she
knew a sweater would have covered up the word
she wrote on her right and left arms. The word
scrawled in permanent ink was so thick, it would
stain her skin for days to follow -love.
Bissell was one of more than 1 million con-
firmed guests on the global Facebook event page
to take part in To Write Love On Her Arms Day,
an event organized by fans of the nonprofit orga-
nization but not officially affiliated with the orga-
nization.
Participants were encouraged to write the
word "love" on their arms to spread the message
of the organization.
"Everything about To Write Love On Her
Arms resonates with me," the UF sophomore
said. "It's close to my heart."
According to the organization's Web site, To
Write Love On Her Arms is a nonprofit move-
ment dedicated to offering hope and help for
people struggling with depression, addiction,self-injury and suicide.
In the spirit of the event, Bissell explained the
message of the organization to the one person
who inquired about the word on her arms. She
said this single moment was enough.
"She asked me a lot of questions, actually," she
said.
"We hope that by reaching out to
people, we'll be able to build a
strong community."
Erin Villani
UF chapter president and founder
Bissell is the treasurer of UF's chapter of To
Write Love. UF is one of only 14 active universi-
ties across the nation to have a campus chapter for
the organization.
Erin Villani, president and founder of the or-
ganization, said the club launched this fall.
"The mission of our chapter is to increase
awareness about depression, addiction, suicide
and self-injury," said Villani, a UF sophomore.
"We hope that by reaching out to people, we'll be
able to build a strong community."

About 100,000 visit
downtown art show
Melissa Siver plays the drums for Juliette the Puppet, who is controlled by puppeteer Frances Siver, at
the 28th Annual Downtown Festival and Art Show on Sunday morning.Designer aprons, hand-carved
wooden spoons and "silverwear-
able" jewelry were only a few exam-
ples of the art displayed at the 28th
Annual Downtown Festival and Art
Show this weekend.
An estimated 100,000 people
wandered through the brick-paved
streets of downtown Gainesville
from City Hall to the Hippodrome
State Theatre, stopping at more than
250 booths showcasing artwork of
all kinds.
From paintings and photographs
to bird baths and pet accessories, the
booths were packed with people
craning to take a peek.
"I've had a great festival," said
Kay Edenfield, a first-time artist to
the festival, "not just monetarily,
which was good, but I met a lot of
great people."Edenfield said one of the things
that impressed her the most was the
festival was college students she met
at her booth.
She said they were all polite, and
even though most of them could not
afford to buy most of the pieces, they
still stopped and complimented her
on her work.
Lynzee Marmor, a UF creative
photography freshman, volunteered
at the Imagination Station, where
kids could make various crafts and
get their faces painted. She said she
got a chance to look around at all of
the displays before her shift and was
impressed with all of it.
"It's fun to browse," Marmor
said, "and they don't make you feel
obligated to buy, so it's not uncom-
fortable."

New Gainesville grocery store offers a taste of Poland
Prices for products range from 80 cents to $10
By ADAM JALALI
Alligator Contributing Writer
Gainesville residents don't need to hop on
a plane to get a taste of Europe anymore.
The Europe food store, which offers a vari-
ety of Polish treats and more, opened its doors
to customers on Nov. 4.The store, 3312 SW 35th Blvd., offers an au-
thentic variety of pierogi, sausages, deli meat,
bread, fish, cakes and juices.
"You can't buy these foods anywhere else,"
owner Gosia Krzyszczak said.
Krzyszczak, a UF graduate, moved to
Gainesville in 2004 from Szczecin, Poland, and
decided to open the store two years ago afterher mother came to Gainesville.
Despite European food being generally
expensive, the store's products
Local are quite affordable, said David
NeWS Rosenberg, a UF law student.
The products range from 80
cents to $10.
"It's always nice to know I can try thingsI've never eaten before without emptying my
wallet," Rosenberg said.
Krzyszczak said that American students
who've spent time in Europe are frequent cus-
tomers and say the food brings back memories
of their travels.
She plans to add food from other countries,
including Russia and Germany, to the store.
The Europe food store is open from 11 a.m.
to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday and from
noon to 9 p.m. on Sunday.

0 MORE THAN 200 STUFFED
ANIMALS ARE SENT EACH WEEK.
By MELISSA QUINN
Alligator Contributing Writer
In the lobby of the Shands at UF can-
cer unit, a life-size teddy bear stares out at
passers-by. The bear is one of thousands of
stuffed animals distributed by the North
Central Area of the American Cancer So-
ciety's Bears for Cares program.
Victoria Pearson, a social worker at
Shands, started Bears for Cares in 2007.
Since then, volunteers like Margaret Shaw
have collected stuffed animals and given
them to adult cancer patients in 11 coun-
ties, Shaw said.
Bears for Cares began with just teddy
bears, but the group didn't want to reject
other animals, so they began accepting all
kinds, Shaw said.
About 25 volunteers meet on Thurs-
days to sort, wash, brush and tag them.
They are then distributed to Marion, Ala-
chua, Bradford, Union, Gilchrist, Colum-
bia, Hamilton, Levy, Suwannee, Dixie and
Lafayette counties.
Each stuffed animal comes with a cardwith information on services offered by the
American Cancer Society, including trans-
portation to and from the doctor's office,
support groups and help with prescription
co-payments, Shaw said.
Each year, thousands of bears are do-
nated to the organization by schools, local
businesses, banks and individuals in the
community. The stuffed animals can be
new or gently used and are cleaned and
packed into bags until they can be distrib-
uted around North Florida, Shaw said.
Each week, more than 200
Local stuffed animals are sent to
News patients.
Shaw said it's common
to see grown men walking
with the bears tucked under their arms or
curled up in bed snuggling with them.
Gwen Carriere, director of the cancer
program at North Florida Regional Medi-
cal Center, said the bears are a tangible
source of comfort. Known as the "Teddy
Bear Lady," Carriere, who treats patients
in the first year of diagnosis, has distrib-
uted more than 400 stuffed animals.
"Patients just love these animals," Shaw
said. "I never envisioned that this program
would be so popular, and who doesn't
love teddy bears?"Team mentors, collects cans
By ROBERT HILSON
Alligator Contributing Writer
The UF gymnastics team and about two
dozen aspiring 2020 Olympians stocked
local food banks Sunday with enough
canned goods to outweigh a handful of
5-year-olds.
Marching through Gate 4 of the
O'Connell Center at noon, grade-school
gymnasts and their parents donated about
275 pounds of non-perishables before en-
tering the gymnastics studio for the annual
Harvest Food Drive Clinic.
UF gymnasts and coaches guided their
little pupils through an obstacle course of
separate stations, occasionally acting as
impromptu cushions as parents looked on
with cameras in hand.
"It's all she's talked about all weekend,"
said Rachael Smith, 38, of her 10-year-old
daughter, Josie, who's been competing for
two years. "She was even excited about col-
lecting the cans."
Head coach Rhonda Faehn helped lead
warm-up stretching and oversaw the bal-ance beams. She said that the clinic is just
as beneficial to her gymnasts as it is to the
children who participate.
"It's amazing to be able to interact with
these kids, and it's wonderful to have our
athletes become role models," said Faehn,
who got into gymnastics as a child on the
heels of her next-door
neighbor. "This is a pas-
sion for me, not a job. I
get to come out here for a
good cause and promote
physical activity."
Alicia Goodwin, 20,
an All-American in the
uneven bars, agreed
with her coach's senti-
ment. "It's great to be able to help out the
community," she said. "And I coach every
summer. It's good to be on the other side."
Nicole Sjoden, 11, who's been taking
gymnastics since she was 5, gathered with
her friends for a photo with the team after

Road to Nowhere
Obama shouldn't take
middle road in Afghanistan
human cost of the Afghan war has risen sharply in re-
cent months, as evidenced by the headlines that appear all
too frequently. But the financial cost of the war, another
mounting problem, has received less coverage.
At a time when deficits are measured in trillions, a figure
like $54 billion might seem like peanuts. Yet opponents of the
troop surge proposed by Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top com-
mander in Afghanistan, have latched on to this figure, arguing
that it's not a trivial amount by any means.
According to The New York Times, the proposed increase of
40,000 troops will cost an estimated $40 billion to $54 billion per
year. While part of this expense could be offset by $26 billion
in savings from troop withdrawals in Iraq, the addition could
push the overall military budget to $734 billion by 2010.
That would be 10 percent higher than the $667 billion peak
under the Bush administration. Barack Obama, who made early
campaign promises to withdraw from Iraq and eventually scale
down military spending, may soon be spending more than
Bush ever did.
Herein lies Obama's political predicament: He must balance
campaign promises with the realities of a destabilized Middle
East. Afghan security is crumbling, the Taliban is resurgent and
key Pakistani military sites have been attacked in recent months
by militants with Taliban ties.
Opponents of the surge, citing the human and financial costs
of the war, support reductions in troop levels in Afghanistan,
combined with a "surgical strike" effort aimed at terrorist and
militant groups.
So, when faced with two starkly different yet equally dif-
ficult options, which will politically savvy Obama most likely
choose?
Neither. The strategy discussed by most aides is a modest in-
crease in troops: around half of what McChrystal is requesting.
This middle-ground approach may seem politically appealing,
and at half the cost it is certainly cheaper.
But if the top commander in Afghanistan has correctly as-
sessed the situation, this option will produce far less than half
the results. This is because Afghanistan's massive and dispersed
territories are unmanageable without an adequate number of
troops. McChrystal cites the success of the Iraqi troop surge in
supporting his plan.
But generals always ask for more troops, and to control a
diverse set of tribes -even with a massive, long-term military
presence -is not realistic, according to prominent opponents
of the surge like Vice President Joe Biden. Other critics have
called Afghanistan a "graveyard of empires" in reference to the
numerous military failures seen in the region, notably the So-
viet Union's decadelong war that ended in defeat.
Faced with costs that amount to roughly $1 million per year
for every soldier we put in harm's way (not to mention the cost
of lives lost), we believe that this politically palatable plan is not
the best option.
Obama may choose to draw down troop levels and focus on
targeting terrorist enclaves, even though he'll face fierce criti-
cism at home and the chance that a destabilized Afghanistan
could produce terrorist threats.
He may choose to increase the troop levels by the amount
McChrystal is requesting, in an attempt to stamp out the Tali-
ban and unite the country. This will anger his political base and
has the chance to produce a long, drawn-out conflict.
But by maintaining current levels, or increase troops only
marginally, Obama will surely face the downsides of both
aforementioned options, while Americans will still be in harm's
way and a stable Afghanistan will be just out of reach.
The middle-ground comes at half the cost and has none of
the benefits.

US should give terrorists civilian trialsO n Sept. 11 we lost not just lives and concrete build-
ings, but a way of life.
Personal freedoms, or what some considered per-
sonal freedoms, were suddenly suppressed in airports. Fear,
rampant as the rubble still smoldered in New York, Wash-
ington and Pennsylvania, only peaked as letters filled with
anthrax made their rounds. Racial profiling, once frowned
upon, was suddenly left for debate as if it was an option on
the table.
Not all of these things persisted, but a threat that had long
existed in our society came to fruition: our apathy. When tales
of extraordinary rendition (the transfer of prisoners outside
the U.S., where laws governing interrogation are less strin-
gent), illegal domestic wiretapping and torture by our gov-
ernment surfaced, no one took to the streets in sizes similar to
the rallies held over the past year. When it became clear that
we had waged war on false pretenses, we simply accepted an
unbearable fact and moved on. When we were made aware
that there was a detention center in Cuba depriving detain-
ees of the very rights we were spilling our nation's blood for,
there were few rallying calls heard in the halls of our public
conscience.
Tom Junod, Esquire magazine's writer-at-large, once
wrote that the decade we live in is the decade of the "Moral
Bubble," and that it "will not be pricked until we take re-
sponsibility not just for the forty-third president's actions but
for our 'inaction' -for all the agreements we've made with-
out awareness, for all the awareness we've come to without
vigilance, for all the times we've touched the easy, insulating
button of our assent."
It wouldn't be fair to dump any or all of our nation's mor-
al shortcomings squarely on George W. Bush's feet. In times
of great crises and challenges, we tend to lose moral high
ground as a society. Even Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose head
graces our dime, issued an executive order that forcibly relo-
cated around 120,000 Japanese Americans to "war relocationcamps" during the World War II.
Yet even when we do freak out,
even when we make real Adlai Ste-
venson's dictum that "it is far easier
to fight for principles than to live up
to them," we eventually redeem our-
Matthew Christ selves. It took 40 years after FDR's
letters@a ligator org Japanese internment camps for our
government to offer a legal apology
to the families of those interned. And
now, in 2009, it looks like we have once again found a way
to cope with the shortcomings of our principles in the awful
aftermath of Sept. 11.
Recently we have learned that many accused of organiz-
ing and implementing the Sept. 11 terror attacks will face
trial, not in front of a military tribunal, but in front of a jury
in New York City, just minutes from where the World Trade
Center towers crumbled.
Every instinct tells me that we shouldn't give those who
have confessed to playing a role in Sept. 11 attacks any trial,
much less a civilian trial or any other rights they continually
wish to destroy. But in offering a civilian trial, we will show
that we are no longer steeped in fear, afraid that a courthouse
could become a target or turned into a public platform for
espousing the wicked credo of those like Khalid Sheikh Mo-
hammed; that we are willing to judge not by whatever ex-
treme fanatical sect of Islam the defendants belong to but by
their heinous actions; and that we are willing to disclose any
of the rash shortcomings of our principles that we made out
of confusion and fear to show we are willing to learn from
our mistakes.
This is what a free country does. It's hard, sure, but quite
frankly, I couldn't think of a better justice for those who seek
the end of our freedom than by showing how resilient we
have become since that September morning eight years ago.

E-cigarettes shouldn't be banned
I support the campus smoking ban and
free cessation classes for employees, but
proposed regulation UF 2.022 should not
ban e-cigarette usage for simply looking
like smoking.
While their name and shape make them
a fashionable political target, e-cigarettes
contain no tobacco and create only general-
ly harmless nicotine vapor instead of harm-
ful and carcinogenic smoke. Pure nicotine's
similarity to caffeine likely makes their
harm potential closer to that of an espresso,
with the only second-hand risk being social:
to be seen in the company of a "smoker."
Our peer pressure to reduce smoking
should continue, but after watching fam-
ily members fail to quit smoking for de-
cades, we should realize harm reduction
is a worthy principle, too. People deserve
more choices than quitting or dying, and
compelling even some of the U.S.'s 14 mil-
lion smokers to switch to non-smoked nico-
tine sources could yield great public health
gains. UF shouldn't promote these devices
but simply leave regulation to existing laws.
At the very least we should permit very dis-
creet usage, especially for longtime smok-ers or those who've failed to quit.

Obama's hesitation deserves acclaim
An Associated Press article Thursday
stated that Barack Obama's hesitancy on
Afghan war buildup implies weakness. I
wish world leaders had more of that kind of
weakness. President Obama does not want
to send soldiers into harm's way without a
clear goal, a solid plan and an exit strategy.
I know that Americans are used to
presidents who play cowboy, who say
things like "Bring 'em on" and "Mission
Accomplished" without a second thought,
presidents who send Americans into battle
on falsified weapons reports. But it seems
like our current president understands that
you don't send soldiers into battle without
first nailing down what we're supposed to
be doing and why. So hats off to Obama's
"hesitation." Soldiers are human beings,
not chess pieces. It's about time we get a
president who understands that.

Gay marriage is inevitable
ay marriage recently suffered adevastating setback in Maine. This
loss was made all the worse be-
cause it not only amended the constitution
to outlaw gay marriage, it was also in a
state that previously allowed it.
The self-doubt created from this loss
has caused some to look to the federal
government -instead of states -for gay
rights legislation. This is a mistake. A state-
orientated campaign is the only strategy
that has any hope for success.
A bill legalizing gay marriage would
be "dead on arrival" in the Senate. There
would be the inevitable filibuster, and
the Democrats would not have the votes
to override it. Democrats might have a
supermajority in the Senate, but they are
not a cohesive bloc. This diversity in the
Democratic Party is what has allowed it to
take power and is not a bad thing; it's just
reality that the Senate will not legalize gay
marriage without overwhelming public
support. The only other option is to look to
the states for gay rights legislation.
Gay rights legislation will happen. The
demographics are with us. A recent study
by the The Pew Research Center for the
People & the Press found that 58 percent of
18- to 29-year-old respondents supported
gay marriage.Nick Miner Unfortunately,
Speaking Out its support quickly
tapers off to 22 per-
cent among those
65 and older. There is a clear generation-
al gap in views on gay marriage. Older
Americans are against it while the younger
generations are increasingly supportive of
it. Conservatives and the Republican Party
won this fight, but they have lost the war.
So what is the best short-term strategy?
The answer probably lies in Washington
state's "everything but marriage" law.
This law gives civil unions all the ben-
efits and protections of marriage without
the name. Coupled with this, the same
Pew study found 57 percent of respon-
dents nationwide support civil unions.
This suggests that the best strategy is to
fight for strong civil unions laws that over
time can be expanded to full marriage
equality. This gradual change will help to
minimize backlash. It will allow conser-
vatives time to adjust to societal changes
and see that the world isn't ending. This
gradual process, while requiring the ac-
ceptance of discrimination for a bit longer,
will pay dividends in the end because it
will banish opponents to the irrational
fringe of society.

lining the stage in a literal representa-
tion of the festival of lights.
The performances fused together
Western and Eastern culture, putting
hip-hop twists on traditional Indian
moves. While some performers shim-
mied under layers of classic Indian
attire, others rocked in cargo pants
and metallic sneakers, paying tribute
to American-Indian fusion.
"A lot of our generation grew up
here," said Devesh Goswami, a UF
electric engineering graduate stu-
dent and performer. "But at the same
time, we're all South Asian. It kind
of represents our generation coming
together."
It was Goswami's first time par-
ticipating in the Diwali Show, a deci-
sion he made after years of watching
the cultural spectacle as an audience
member. He estimated he spent about30 hours rehearsing for the show.
The show consisted of 17 perfor-
mances by dance groups including
Gator Fusion, Gator Garba, Gator
Bhangra and Gator Raas.
The performances were broken
up by live skits meant to represent a
live Bollywood movie set in the Gator
Nation.
On The performance
Campus also featured a fashion
show, where 96 per-
formers showed off clothing rang-
ing from shimmering saris to formal
dress wear. Instead of strutting down
a runway, participants danced in
pairs, posing between moves.
Dave, who had been a little anx-
ious before the show, said the perfor-
mance was significant to her cultural
roots.
"It's important to incorporate
where we're from [into the dance
routines]," Dave said. "It's a fusion of
two backgrounds."
STUDENT LIFE
Confusion gives grad
idea for new condom
By JOEY FLECHAS
Alligator Contributing Writer
One night in 1995, Beau Thompson
brought a lady home, with hopes of seeing
some action before the night was over.
However, as things in the bedroom be-
gan to heat up, he encountered the bane of
every sexual encounter -he was taking too
long to put a condom on.
"I was trying to be responsible, trying
to get one of these rascals on," Thompson
said.
With the lights out, he couldn't see the
condom and couldn't tell which side was
which.
"I just thought to myself, 'There's gotta
be a better way,"' he said.
Thompson, a UF architecture alumnus,
is the inventor of Sensis Condoms with
QuikStrips, a new condom with two poly-
ethylene tabs rolled into it that allows the
user to roll the condom on with ease. The
two strips peel away, like a Band-Aid.
Thompson, 44, said he has always had a
mindset conducive to innovation.
He's been adept with his hands since his
youth. Whether it was building a tree house
or taking apart and reconfiguring his bike,
he had an architect's heart.
His passion for building got him through
the architecture program at UF, where he
said he was surrounded by intense aca-
demic competition that motivated him to
succeed.
After graduating in 1988,
Thompson started his ar-
chitecture company,
Beau'Sart Company.
It was after that
night in '95 that heresolved to improve the design of one the
oldest forms of contraception, a task that
proved no small feat.
As he paid the bills through Beau'Sart,
he struggled to develop any kind of inno-
vation when, as he was taking out the trash
one day, he had an epiphany.
As he pulled the straps of the garbage
bag to tie a knot, it dawned on him: Why
can't a condom have pull-away straps?
Six months later, he had a design, but no
sure way of mass production. After another
six months, a prototype for the manufactur-
ing machine was finished.
Pouring his earnings into his inven-
tion, he wouldn't even let hunger stand in
his way. He had to resort to hunting on a
friend's ranch to put food on the table.
For Thompson, a diet of venison, pork
and turkey had to suffice.
After years of perseverance, his new ma-
chine and condom was met with interest by
Grove Medical LLC, where the product now
has a home and a way to reach markets.
Together with CPA and fellow UF grad-
uate Josh Glick, 37, Thompson is marketing
his invention and looking to make a lasting
impact on the industry.
"All condoms should have this," said
Glick, a Fisher School of Accounting alu-
mus and a firm believer in the potential of
Sensis.
He notes the health factors that make the
condom revolutionary, like the prevention
of flipping condoms after contact
with the partner, which could
lead to the unintended
spread of disease.
"It just a way to
make safe sex safer,"
Thompson said.

Bondoc was followed by Steve Byrne,
an up-and-coming comedian who
has appeared multiple times on Com-
edy Central, including his own special,
which aired in 2008.
Byrne performed an almost hourlong
routine to the packed amphitheater.
Many of his jokes centered on race, rela-
tionships and sex.
"Asians are good at math. That's not
a stereotype -that's fact," joked the
Irish-Korean comedian.
Quest Crew, who headlined the festi-
val, closed with the series of flips, spins,jumps, kicks and dances that won them
the title of America's Best Dance Crew
and the adulation of the crowd.
In between the main acts, there was
a celebration of UF's Asian-American
students, in keeping with Kaleidoscope
Month's theme, titled "One."
Two students performed a song to
open the show, followed by Gator Fu-
sion, a student dance crew that combines
elements of Bhangra, an Indian form of
dance, and hip-hop.
Other events held during the month
include the Mr. and Miss AASU Pageant,
Rice Bowl and the Asian Food Festival.
Urbano would not release the amount
of money spent on the acts.

Macklin overcomes slow start to lead Florida rout
U THE JUNIOR HAD 13 POINTS AND EIGHT
REBOUNDS IN HIS REGULAR-SEASON DEBUT.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
Vernon Macklin's regular-season debut for Florida
couldn't have started much worse.
In the first 54 seconds of Sunday's game, he had an
early layup blocked against the backboard, committed
an over-the-back foul and he was subbed out for sopho-
more Kenny Kadji a little more than two minutes into
the first half.
After UF coach Billy Donovan reminded the 6-foot-
10 junior center to relax and not try to do too much,
Macklin returned to the floor and went on to finish with A
13 points, eight rebounds and three blocks in UF's 74-
46 season-opening win against Stetson in the O'Connell
Center.
Macklin struggled down low against outsized oppo-
nents in the Gators' two exhibition games, but he had a
meeting with Donovan earlier in the week to talk about
some of the things that were bothering him.
Donovan texted Macklin and invited him to watch
film, and the two talked about the outside pressure of
the center being the team's savior in the post and the
added suspense of not having played a regular-season
game since the 2007-08 season.
"I just had to relax," Macklin said. "I was trying to
go out there and try to do too much instead of relaxing.
Once I sat back and relaxed, I felt better." Andrew Stanfill / Alligator StaffThe resulting tension had Macklin thinking too much UF center Vernon Macklin battles Stetson defenders while going for a layup during the Gators' 74-46 win over Stetson

Meyer, Spurrier not to be compared
COLUMBIA, S.C.
t has been almost five full seasons
since Steve Spurrier took over as South
Carolina's coach, but as I watched his
post-game press conference on the video
screen at Williams-Brice Stadium, it still
felt unnatural.
Spurrier was his usual self (of Justin
Trattou's game-changing interception
off a deflection, Spurrier deadpanned:
"That's not what we were trying to do"),
it's just that my first thought upon seeing
him is that he's at Florida.
Obviously, I know better, but that
split-second of confusion is something
that will never really go away, no matter
how many wins Urban Meyer puts up in
Gainesville.
Spurrier was one of the best players
in school history, then took the Gators to
new heights and established the program
as a national power.
Meyer resurrected the team from me-
diocrity and is on his way to making it
the country's premier football school.
Those are two different accomplish-Mike McCall
McCall-in' It

mmccall@a ligator orgments, and there's
no comparison for
their places in UF
history.
As far as wins go,
national titles trump
all in mybook, mean-
ing Meyer is the top
dog.
But there's more
to this discussion.
It's really about the places these two hold
in the hearts of Florida fans.
I can't judge that, but I get the sense
that most of the Gators faithful like see-
ing Spurrier win, even though he coaches
a team in the same division.
If Meyer winds up at Kentucky one
day (ha!) or Notre Dame or even succeed-
ing Bill Belichick with the New England
Patriots, I don't consider it a lock for that
to happen.
There's a lot to say for the person who
establishes a team or even a business as
successful, and that can never be taken
SEE MCCALL, PAGE 14Hopes of 19th title fade
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Writer
achia ng@alligator org
As the final kill fell on the Gators'
side of the net, so did their dreams of
winning a 19th consecutive conference
title.
On Friday, No. 10 Florida was de-
feated by No. 19 LSU for the second
time this season 3-1 (24-26, 25-23, 25-19,
25-17).
With just three more conference
matches remaining, the Gators (20-4,
14-3 Southeastern Conference) have
only a slim chance at the conference
championship. The loss put them two
and a half matches behind SEC leader
Kentucky and one and a half matches
behind LSU (22-5, 16-2 SEC).
"That was a really good LSU team,
probably one of the best SEC teams I
have ever played," senior libero ElyseCusack said.
The first set was the only bright spot
for UF, as they were able to rally from a
16-10 deficit to eventually win the open-
ing round. But LSU returned the favor
in the second frame as they trailed 17-13
but still found a way to
pull it out.
"Going into the
locker room we joked
around how we stoleVolleyball the game one and they
stole game two," Cu-
sack said. "But we went into the locker
room tied 1-1, and we just didn't come
out strong enough."
After the first two sets, it got ugly for
the Gators -16 service errors never al-
lowed them to get any sort of momen-
tum. Cusack attributed the errors to the
team's attempt to keep the LSU offense
out of system with aggressive serves.

UF SOCCER
Gators season ends in NCAA second round
By TYLER JETT
Alligator Writer
tjett@a Iligator org
One miscue made for an
abrupt end.
Playing a sport where scores
are invaluable, a steal by mid-
fielder Rachael Axon led to an
Oregon State golden goal, end-
ing the game and No. 9 Florida's
season in the second round of the
NCAA Tournament 1-0 Sunday.
"We're all going to be back,
and we're going to keep work-
ing just as hard," said sophomore
Lindsay Thompson, UF's leading
scorer this season.
But that news is no consola-
tion for Florida's five seniors,
who will never don a Gators
uniform again. While the team
was dominated by youth with 23
underclassmen, the seniors av-
eraged 62 minutes of action per
game.
The class, led by three-time
All-SEC First-Team selection and
Southeastern Conference De-fender of the Year Lauren Hyde,
will leave Gainesville with four
SEC Championship rings.
But it could not provide the
answer Sunday.
After Axon stole the ball in
Florida's defensive third, she sent
a through pass to sophomore
Melinda Ingalls inside the box.
Ingalls then fired a shot from 16
yards out, beating Gators goal-
keeper Katie Fraine to her right
in the 99th minute.
"I honestly take responsibil-
ity for that goal because that's
something I should have saved,"
Fraine said. ".My job is those
shots, and I wasn't set."
After Ingalls scored the game-
winner, Fraine sat in front of the
goal, throwing her gloves on the
ground in disgust while the rest
of the team stood in shock.
After struggling early in the
year, coach Becky Burleigh put
more of an emphasis on team de-
fense, and the backline respond-
ed by stringing off six shutouts in
seven games leading up to Sun-day.
The only goal Florida surren-
dered during that stretch was in
a 1-0 loss to South Carolina on
Nov. 6, and that score came on a
penalty kick.
The turnover aside, UF's de-
fense played well against Oregon
State, and Burleigh said the big-
ger problem was the Gators at-
tack, as Florida
failed to put a
shot on goal all
game.
The Beavers
played with
five midfielders
and pressured
the Gators each
time a UF play-
er touched the ball, exploiting
Florida's youth.
After senior forward Ashlee
Elliott suffered a torn ACL in her
left knee in just the third game of
the season, Burleigh looked to the
team's underclassmen to provide
offense and UF's top-five scorers
were freshmen and sophomores.Unfortunately for the Gators,
the inexperienced offensive
weapons disappeared in the most
important game of the season.
The young players, who had sur-
prised conference rivals all year
by playing with poise, picked the
most agonizing time to experi-
ence growing pains.
"Being such a youth-oriented
team right now, I think (the loss)
will be really good for us," Fraine
said.
Florida's underclassmen actu-
ally played better as the year pro-
gressed and the games became
more important.
The last 15 goals of the season
were from freshmen and sopho-
mores. With Elliott set to return
next season after receiving a
medical redshirt, the Gators at-
tack should be more dangerous
next year.
That won't ease the end of this
season.
"I would have given anything
to keep playing with my seniors,"
Thompson said.
LSU first SEC opponent to sweep season series under Wise
VOLLEYBALL, from page 13 -
Senior opposite hitter Marina Skender was
a constant force for the Tigers as she racked
up 20 kills on 64 attempts while also digging
up 15 balls.
"Marina may in fact be the best volleyball
player in the league," UF coach Mary Wise
said. "What she does for that team in all as-
pects of the game is pretty elite."
Another one of the top players in the con-
ference, UF sophomore setter Kelly Murphy,
grabbed her eighth triple-double of the sea-
son against the Tigers with 13 kills, 29 assists
and 15 digs.
However, much of the talk before the
match was about LSU's senior middle blocker
Brittnee Cooper, who domi-
nated the Gators in their
first matchup. On Friday,
she recorded 16 kills to go
Volleyball along with a .500 hitting ef-
ficiency. In the final set, she
could not be stopped as she
knocked down six of her kills on just as many
attempts.
"In the fourth game, she kind of took
over," Murphy said. "I feel like we kind of
contained her in the first two games, but after
that, she just went off and we had no answer
for her."
The two losses to the Tigers this season
marks the first time the Gators have lost twice
to a conference opponent in the regular sea-
son under Wise.
"LSU is a really tough matchup for us.
What they do well, we have trouble stop-
ping," Wise said. "I'm just glad we are done
playing them."Matt Tripp/Alligator Staff

on the court, which Donovan
said was even visible in the
way Macklin stood.
"He's a great athlete when
his knees are bent and he's
ready to go, and he's an av-
erage athlete and average
player when his knees are
straight up and down," Don-
ovan said. "He can control all
the things that are going to
make him a good player and
help our team."
Joining Macklin in the
starting frontcourt, power
forward Alex Tyus led the
team with 13 rebounds, 10 of
them on the defensive end,
and added 12 points for the
sixth double-double of his
career.
Forward Chandler Par-
sons came off the bench to
score a team-high 14 points.
His final 3 points, which
came with 33 seconds left in
the game, kept Florida's 580-
game streak with at least one
3-pointer alive.
"I honestly had no idea 'til
I walked in the locker room
and (UF athletics director)
Jeremy Foley told me about
it," Parsons said. "I noticed
at first that it got really loud,
but I'm honored to keep the
streak alive."
Parsons' streak-saving
three came after UF missed its
first 12 from beyond the arc,
putting the team's 3-point
percentage at 7.7 percent, a
far cry from the its 52.5-per-
cent shooting from the field
and 11-for-15 performance
from the free throw line.
"We had a pretty good
opportunity to go 0-fer from
the game," Donovan said
about his team's poor outside
shooting. "Generally, when
you struggle like that behind
the 3-point line, you have
that many turnovers and
there's no flow offensively,
it can really carry over to the
defensive end of the floor."
But the Gators' defense
didn't struggle at all against
the Hatters, holding them
to only nine points in the
game's opening 17 minutes
and 28.6 percent shooting for
the game. UF used its full-
court press early and often,
forcing 18 turnovers, nine of
which came in the first half.
"We were able to force
them to go deep into the shot
clock, didn't really give up
any easy shots coming out of
the press and didn't give up
a lot of easy baskets early in
transition," Donovan said.
MONDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2009 U ALLIGATOR, 15
Florida defense holds South Carolina to 41 yards in second half
FOOTBALL, from page 1
Gators had allowed 210 yards or less in the
entirety of four conference games (Tennessee,
Kentucky, LSU and Vanderbilt).
That was a big reason why UF (10-0, 8-0
SEC) held only a three-point advantage at
halftime -tied with the Mississippi State
game for its slimmest lead at intermission this
season.
"Seeing what the score was after the first
half of this game was pretty much like, 'Man,
the season's on the line. We're only up by
three points. We're not used to this. We need
to come out firing on all cylinders,"' linebacker
Ryan Stamper said, "and we did."
South Carolina (6-5, 3-5 SEC) had only
41 total yards after the break, although the
game's outcome may have been altered by a
single play. After three quarters, the Game-
cocks trailed by just three points and faced a
third and 3 at the UF 22-yard-line.
Stephen Garcia dropped back and threw a
pass intended for Moe Brown, but the pass hit
off Brown's facemask and went up in the air.
Florida defensive end Justin Trattou
grabbed it and ran it back 53 yards. Tim Tebow
ran it in from 1 yard out four plays later, and
UF had a 10-point lead with 13:25 to go.
"That was huge. The whole field was tilt-
ing," Meyer said. "The field shifted back. Mo-
mentum completely swung. You felt it in the
stadium. That'll go down in history as one of
the great plays."Now, UF looks to polish itself with three
weeks left until a SEC Championship Game
date with No. 2 Alabama (10-0, 7-0 SEC) onDec. 5.
The offense came out rolling, scoring 17
points on its first three drives, including a

ing UF's 24-14 win in Williams-Brice Stadium in Columbia, S.C., on Saturday.68-yard catch-and-run from Tebow to Coo-
per. But Florida struggled in the second half,
scoring only on the short field after Trattou's
interception. The Gators' average second-half
starting field position was the Gamecocks'
40-yard-line, and UF had four scoreless pos-
sessions that started in South Carolina terri-
tory.
Two would-be touchdowns that hit off of
Cooper's fingertips didn't help.
"We took the shots down the field," Meyer
said. "I'm so tired of seeing balls go off finger-
tips. We have to (make those). We all know
what's coming down the road."
There is, however, something to be said for
Florida's ability to find a way to win. Players
and coaches alike said after the game that they
have come to expect a game-changing play
like Trattou's.
So despite the continuing red-zone strug-
gles (UF ranks 94th in the country) and al-
though Caleb Sturgis missed three of four field
goals including a 29-yarder in the fourth quar-
ter, the Gators were singing with the band for
the 20th straight time Saturday night.
And they feel all these close games -UF
has won half of its games by 10 points or less
-leave them better off.
"To be battle-tested, to find a way to win
that game, as opposed to finding a way not to
win that game," Meyer said. "In'07, we found
a way to lose several of those games. In '08,
we found a way to win them, and '09 we have
found a way to win a couple."
Florida 2I, South Carolina 1410
Cunningham continues to come on strong, retaking the team
lead in sacks after two in the fourth quarter Saturday. All
of the senior's sacks have come in the last six games, and
his play was key to a Florida defense that allowed minus-20
