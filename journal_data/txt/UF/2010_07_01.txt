after he chased another man around a Salem taco stand while 
armed with a machete. Salem police said Monday the man ac-cused the taco stand owner of stealing a drill from his nearby business. When the taco stand owner denied it, the suspect left and returned with a machete.
Lt. Dave Okada said the suspect chased the unidentified man 
around the stand several times before officers arrested him on accusations of menacing and attempted assault. He was booked into the Marion County Jail.
There were no injuries in Sunday’s incident.

AMERICANS TAN INDOORS EACH YEAR.

A 10 percent tax will be added 
to indoor tanning bills beginning 
today. 
The tax is part of the health care 
reform President Obama signed into 
law in March. 
The tax will be placed on elec-
tronic products that require one or more ultraviolet lamps with wave-lengths between 200 and 400 nano-meters, according to Internal Rev-
enue Service guidelines.
The tax is expected to produce 
$2.7 billion by 2019, according to 
the Congressional Joint Committee 
on Taxation. This money will fund 
the new health care reform package and requires tanning salons to col-lect and report the tax to the govern-
ment each quarter. 
The tanning tax replaced the 5 percent “Botax” on cosmetic surgery after complaints from medical and 
dermatological associations.
John Overstreet, spokesman for 
the Indoor Tanning Association, said the tax is an intrusion by the 
government into Americans’ lives. 
“You better watch. Next you 
know they will go down to Daytona 
and put a tax on lying in the sun,” 
Overstreet said.
According to Overstreet, busi-
nesses are already on the edge as is.
“You can’t raise product by 10 
percent and not have an effect,” Overstreet said. “Those that are al-
ready struggling will hurt, no ques-tion about it.” 
The tax will affect an estimated 
18,000 small businesses nationwide including retail, manufacturing and distribution businesses, as well as the 10 percent of Americans who tan 
indoors each year, according to the 
ITA.
Mandi Nazzaro, owner of The 
Golden Gator, said she hopes there 
will be more demand for spray tan-Indoor tanning

Freshmen who’ve come to UF dur-
ing Summer B will get a glimpse of the 
artistic and cultural experiences at the 
university.
Creative B, a collaboration between 
the College of Fine Arts, the Harn Mu-seum of Art, the Digital Worlds Insti-
tute and a number of other colleges, 
aims to make the summer semester more exciting by bringing artistic events to campus.
While the atmosphere of Summer B 
is usually not as vibrant as that of the fall or spring, the purpose of Creative B is exposing freshmen to cultural activi-
ties during their first days on campus, 
said Andy Howard, spokesman for the College of Fine Arts.
Although Creative B is designed to 
improve freshmen stu-
dents’ first experiences on 
campus, it is also helping upperclassmen and UF 
faculty, he said.
Creative B got a head start dur-
ing Summer A, when six events took place. One of the more popular events, a walking tour of campus, Howard UF promotes creativity

UF students can now have free Internet 
with their grande, triple-espresso, non-fat, ex-
tra hot chai tea lattes when they go to an off-
campus Starbucks.
Although the Starbucks on UF’s campus of-
fers free wireless Internet to students through the university’s network, off-campus franchis-es have charged $3.99 for two hours of access.
Free Wi-Fi or not, Brittany Loftus, an educa-
tion graduate student at UF, said she does not plan to become a regular Starbucks customer. 
Loftus said Coffee Culture on Northwest 13th 
Street has been her favorite study spot for the past two years.
“I come here because it’s a local business, 
and I would rather support a local business than support a national chain,” she said.
In the fall, Starbucks will also offer in-store access to The Wall Street Journal, but that 
won’t entice Loftus to make the switch.
The Wall Street Journal is a good newspa-
per, but there are plenty of other free newspa-
pers online, she said.
Coffee Culture owner Alisa Rowe Kenney 
said she struggled to compete with Starbucks when she opened her first store in 2003. But she, like other coffee shop owners, found a niche. People who like the “slick” atmosphere prefer Starbucks, while people who like an Free Wi-Fi at Starbucks

UF RESEARCH
By ALEXANDER KLAUSNER
Alligator Contributing Writer
Heavy rains and lightning storms are 
common in Gainesville during summer. 
  That’s convenient for UF lightning 
researchers, who recently received a 
$9.8-million federal grant to hire gradu-
ate and undergraduate students, as well 
as purchase new equipment. 
“It’s pretty exciting,” said Vladimir 
Rakov, professor of electrical and com-puter engineering at UF. “Funding for lightning research is usually pretty low.” 
Most grants for lightning research are 
given following lightning-related disas-ters like the lightning strike of Apollo 12 
in the 1960s, he said. However, no such 
disasters have occurred recently, he said.
The grant went into effect June 1, and 
seven UF graduate and undergraduate students have already been hired. The grant’s purpose is to study how light-ning makes its way from the cloud to the ground, and how it selects where it will strike, he said. Researchers need the as-sistance of several high-speed cameras to 
capture pictures of strikes. They already 
have three such cameras and will look to 
purchase two or three more, he said. 
The new cameras will be able to film 
at 3 million frames per second and will 
be used at the research facility at Camp Blanding, where researchers have the ca-pability to artificially trigger lightning. 
To trigger the lightning, researchers 
connect a wire to a rocket and launch it at a thundercloud. When a cloud is ready to discharge a bolt of lightning, they fire the rocket toward the cloud. The rocket 
creates a stronger electrical field near the 
cloud, which triggers a lightning strike to where the wire is grounded.Lightning researchers 
get $9.8-million grant By HOLLY KANE

Come August, journalism students will 
have another reason to be familiar with their 
college besides grades.
The University Athletic Association is 
partnering with the College of Journalism 
and Communications by moving its Gator-
Vision facility into Weimer Hall. 
The new facility will include editing and 
office spaces that could offer the college’s broadcasting students work experience and resume fillers, said Jerry Wetzel, director of electronic media for UAA. 
GatorVision, the radio and television 
arm of the athletic department, produces TV 
shows, oversees GatorZone.com and streams 
live sports-related events online.
“It creates synergy between the UAA and 
the college, which is going to be a positive move for getting students involved in sports broadcasting,” Wetzel said.
GatorVision had been looking for a better 
office space and learning environment for a number of years, Wetzel said, before consid-ering Weimer Hall.
“It just made sense,” he said. GatorVision will focus on the introduction 
of high-definition, non-linear and tapeless technologies into the new space so students are better able to keep up with the industry.
“This collaboration dramatically enhanc-
es our ability to deliver high quality multi-media productions for Gator athletics, while also serving as a significant educational op-
portunity for University of Florida students,” said Jeremy 
Foley, director of athletics, in a 
press release.
UAA will staff office spaces and editing 
areas where Wetzel said mass communica-tion students can learn about editing, report-ing and creating broadcast stories, which can 
be used for building their resumes.
UAA will foot the $450,000-bill to cover 
integration and move-in, set to be complete by Aug. 15, although Wetzel is unsure when 
it will be open for use. 
“It depends on when we get the furniture 
in,” he said.GatorVision relocates

Miles Doran, a recent UF graduate, won the Hearst National 
Television Broadcast News Championship and a $5,000 prize in 
New York City June 11. The championship chooses the top stu-dent reporters from a series of monthly competitions held dur-
ing the school year. At the championship, the students are given 
on-the-spot news assignments with no information given before-hand.
Doran has gone to the Hearst championships twice before, 
both times in San Francisco. In 2008, his sophomore year, he re-ceived fourth place in radio news. The next year, he earned third place in television news.
This time was different.“I already had some contacts in the city which helped me,” he 
said.
Doran, who graduated April 30 with a degree in telecommu-
nications, said he was more prepared this time around because he was already living in New York City working for CBS.
“This year, it was about security in New York after the Times 
Square bombing attempt a month or two ago,” he said.
Contestants filmed the news on June 9 and edited on June 10.Despite being familiar with the city, Doran still met obstacles.“We didn’t have a car, and we had to lug all this equipment 
through the subway and taxis,” he said. “That made it a little bit more challenging. It was also raining that evening. . . but every-thing turned out all right.”
He said he never doubted that his story would come through.Tom Krynski, WRUF’s news director and one of Doran’s men-
tors, said Doran’s success was not surprising.
“He enjoyed it so much,” Krynski said. “It wasn’t work to him. 
It wasn’t a burden to him to do something special.”
While working for Krynski, Doran competed against profes-
sionals and students to win a national Edward R. Murrow Award. His story outlining the inner workings of security at UF football games won for best use of sound and also earned first place in a Society of Professional Journalists’ competition for in-depth re-porting. 
Doran’s curiosity, work ethic and ability to look at things dif-
ferently help him find stories, Krynski said.
“He was willing to give up other things to do what he loved to 
do,” Krynski said.
Although Doran worked for WRUF’s radio station and WUFT’s 
TV station as a student, his interest in broadcasting started before 
he hit college. He shadowed people in meteorology in third grade, 
according to his mother, Wendy Doran, of Palm Harbor. He also accompanied his father, who works in marine transportation, tracking storms in Puerto Rico.
“We basically told him if you want to get something going you 
need to be the one to do it. He worked tirelessly,” Wendy Doran said.
Although people told Miles Doran he couldn’t get an intern-
ship in high school, he finally got one working for WFTS, an ABC 
news station in Tampa. Five years later, Doran works for CBS as a 
digital journalist, shooting, editing and producing content.
“I’m loving what I’m doing right now, and I’m just trying not 
to mess it up,” he said.4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 1, 2010

Student Body President Ashton Charles 
has finished her nominations for the last 
empty Student Government cabinet seats.
Senators unanimously approved the 
four remaining nominees during Tues-day’s meeting after interviewing them, 
some via speakerphone, about their expe-
rience and ideas for their cabinets.
Charles addressed senators over the 
phone as she boarded a plane in Washing-ton, D.C., and briefly told them about why she chose her nominees.
Amanda Griffin will hold the position 
of supervisor of elec-
tions, James Dieterle 
will be the Athletics 
Cabinet Secretary, Pau-
la Irvin will be the Advertising Cabinet 
Director and Casey Goldstein will be the director of the Disability Affairs Cabinet Director.
Senators questioned Griffin about how 
she plans to change the SG elections.She 
said she wants to make sure her assistants 
are well-versed in the 700 codes, which 
outline the election rules in the Student Body constitution.
Griffin said she would not change any 
election codes, such as those dealing with door-to-door campaigning, without the approval of the Senate.
“I would never think of changing any-
thing unless I was told to do so,” she said.Senators

A 22-year-old UF student was arrested 
and charged with trafficking large amounts 
of marijuana and cocaine late Tuesday night 
after attempting to run from police officers.
Cameron Schmidt, who was wearing a 
backpack filled with what was later found 
to be drug paraphernalia and a gun, was 
stopped around 11 p.m. while walking east 
on Northwest Third Avenue with a friend, 
according to the Gainesville Police Depart-ment report. 
A Gainesville Police officer first noticed the pair walking down the street holding red Solo cups. 
When asked what was in the cups, both 
Schmidt and his friend told the officer they were drinking whiskey and Coke. When the officer asked the two to step to the front of the squad car, they started running south on Northwest 12th Terrace, the report stated.
The officer chased the men in his car 
and caught up with them in the old Mel-low Mushroom parking lot on University Avenue. Schmidt was caught, but his friend continued to run south until he was out of sight, the report stated.
Schmidt spun around in the officer’s grip and started fighting him to get away. He punched the officer in the face multiple times and pulled his hair, the report said.
Schmidt threw his 
backpack away during the fight and yelled, “I have cocaine … I can’t go to jail. I’m in school.”
Schmidt was finally 
Tasered, which stopped him from resisting long enough for back-up of-
ficers to arrive. He was evaluated by EMS and refused medical treatment, according to the police report.Schmidt’s friend was found by a K-9 Jus-
tice unit at College Manor Apartments at 1216 SW 2nd Ave., the report said.
A search of Schmidt’s backpack turned 
up 32.5 grams of marijuana packaged in separate plastic bags, 56.6 grams of cocaine and a loaded .22 caliber Sig Sauer handgun.
Schmidt has been charged with battery 
on an officer, carrying a concealed weapon without a license, selling cannabis within 1,000 feet of a school, possession of drug paraphernalia, trafficking drugs, resisting arrest without violence and an open con-tainer violation, according to the report. 
His bond is set at $405,550.

When Tyler Brooks’ credit card 
company called about unusual ac-tivity and spending, he had to tell the truth. No, his credit card wasn’t stolen. He spent $500 to purchase 50 tickets for his family and friends to see the third installment of “The Twilight Saga: Eclipse.”
Brooks was just one of about 
2,100 people who arrived at Regal Butler Plaza Cinema 14, 3101 SW 35th Blvd., to pick up their tickets to the premiere of the hit vampire-themed movie from midnight to 3 a.m. Wednesday.
Those who arrived to purchase 
tickets at the box office were out of luck.
“I bought my tickets the day af-
ter advance tickets were available,” said Lizzi Condo, who was sport-ing a handmade black T-shirt read-ing, “Bite me, it’s my birthday.”
Condo celebrated her 20th birth-
day in Theater 11 with about 500 other die-hard fans who were ea-ger to find out which mythical hero would win the heroine’s heart in the final battle of werewolf versus vampire.
“Being labeled as a die-hard 
fan sounds a little intense,” Condo said. “Although … I am here on my birthday.”
On an excitement scale from one to 10, Stephanie Gruber, 22, was at a 10.
She purchased her tickets more 
than a month ago in anticipation of catching the midnight showing. 
Gruber, who is 26 weeks preg-
nant, hopes to share her love of Twilight with her future daughter.
“I definitely want her to watch 
Twilight when she’s old enough,” Gruber said.
In addition to merchandise ven-
dors and a local radio DJ, two Life-South blood donation buses were parked outside the theater, one for “Team Edward,” the other for “Team Jacob,” allowing people to donate blood in exchange for tick-ets with VIP seating and a T-shirt.
Clay Gibbons, LifeSouth com-
munity development coordinator, said “Twilight: New Moon” last year brought 78 donors.
“This year our goal is 78 again,” 
Gibbons said. “If we get 79 – now wouldn’t that be something.”
Ada Martinez had trouble decid-
ing which team to donate blood to.
“I’m team threesome,” Martinez 
said. “Forget Bella, I want both.”

Today’s question: Will you see the “The Twilight Saga: Eclipse” in theaters?
99 TOTAL VOTES43% YES57% NOTuesday’s question: Will you still smoke on campus?Cold Cuts
County has no more 
room to slash budget
Alachua County Commission candidates have been talk-
ing a lot about lowering taxes and cutting spending in the county, but we do not have a clue who they think 
they are kidding.
The county gets most of its money from property taxes, and 
with more than 50,000 of the county’s estimated 250,000 resi-dents being college students, there are a lot of people who are not able to pay into the system. Not to mention that university-owned land, some of the most valuable in the county, is tax ex-empt. Cutting taxes will only force local government to spread its resources even thinner.
And forget spending cuts. They may look good on paper, but 
what service or program is going to suffer the consequences of higher property-tax exemptions and a battered economy? The 
sheriff’s office or fire rescue? It might be nice to see a fewer sher-
iff’s squad cars on the road, but nothing good can come from cutting any more than that. Maybe we should get rid of the quarter-cent sales tax that funds CHOICES, the county health care program. Taking away health insurance from the working poor would be a great way to save money.
Truth be told, there is not a lot of fat left to trim off the county 
budget. Pretty much any cut would end in more unemployment in the county or the loss of a valuable public service.
Sure, proposals from both the county and the city for new 
taxes and fees like the fire assessment are hard to swallow, but the budget shortfalls are very real and need to be made up somehow. Any politician that says otherwise should be taken with a grain of salt.
Dumbing Down
We are not surprised 
the “Twilight” saga is still elicit-
ing “Harry Potter” levels of fanaticism out of women of all ages, but we would be ly-ing if we said it has not had a profound impact on our faith in humanity.
“Twilight” is the kind of 
trope-filled trash that Harle-quin romances are made of. And even with all the poten-tial excitement it could draw from monster folklore, it is probably the only vampire-centric series of stories that 
could put Bram Stoker to 
sleep – if he could stop rolling over in his grave.
Even though it’s only a 
movie, “Twilight” is symp-tomatic of the increasingly bland direction the media are taking. Since “Harry Potter,” everyone has been trying to mystify the world with sim-plistic fantasy stories. It was bad enough when kids took it too far and wished they were actually students at Hogwarts, but it is a tad more outre when women fantasize about their paramours be-ing dead or sharing half their DNA with a dog. Give us a break.
There is a reason high-
school English teachers force Hemingway and Faulkner down students’ throats. Their novels are generally thought -provoking and offer some sort of commentary on the world. They stand on their own as works of art, unlike “Twilight,” which bolsters 
its flimsy plot by becoming 
a money machine that cross-promotes with car companies and fast food chains.
There is always room for 
escapism, especially when it comes to summer blockbust-ers. But please refrain from fooling yourself into thinking “Twilight” is anything other than a quick way to get money out of “Harry Potter” tweens as they enter adulthood.
On Tuesday, I attended the Gainesville Area Cham-
ber of Commerce Candidate forum for County Commission candidates. About a hundred busi-
ness owners showed up to hear the vision of the six candi-dates for Alachua County. One common theme prevailed: the burden on local business from all levels of govern-ment has to subside for the health of the local economy. Increased taxation was shied away from by candidates from both parties. Consistently, all the candidates said we can either be dragged down by the national economic situ-ation, or we find ways to improve upon it.
It should be apparent to all that after 18 months, President 
Obama’s economic plan is not working. Even some of the ap-
parent good news turns out to be bad. According to profes-sor Arthur Laffer, a good portion of the corporate profits we are seeing this year reflects a shift of profits into 2010 to avoid the higher taxes that will come in 2011 with the expiration of the Bush tax cuts.
What’s more, Laffer predicts these higher tax rates will 
provoke the second half of the dreaded double dip reces-sion.
It’s been about two full months since graduation at UF, 
and many people are finding that the job market is nearly im-penetrable. There is probably more money in Nancy Pelosi’s botox job than is being laid out to hire college grads new to the local job market. At this point, prospects for most are dis-couraging.
Likewise, the economic downturn has hit home for many 
of us, as well. Some of our friends and family members are in the same situation looking for stability in a tumultuous 
economic environment.
The financial situation our country is facing is daunting. 
The federal government is slowly backing us into uncontrol-
lable debt but simultaneously refusing to consider a change in attitude when it comes to spending. Unfortunately, there is only so far we can stretch the American dollar. We’re cur-rently only sustaining things because lenders around the world are still will-ing to give the US money. What hap-pens when that stops? We will hit the brick wall of government debt.
In an incredible role reversal, at the 
G20 summit this previous weekend, the US continued to advocate large government spending programs; a lone voice among European protests. 
Admiral Mike Mullen of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff re-
cently warned that the increasing national debt is the biggest threat to U.S. national security.
There is also nothing encouraging to see on the employ-
ment front. Hiring thousands of temporary census workers does not count as real job growth. New jobs come from start-up businesses or newer entrepreneurial enterprises. The administration’s policy track has created a climate that has discouraged businesses from taking the risks of making new investments.
I’m not claiming to be an economic expert nor do I have 
the space in this column to extensively cover all of the issues that need to be addressed. However, I do think we need to 
recognize the ultimate importance of electing politicians this 
November and in the future that have a different approach to handling money. Having the government tax, borrow and spend is not the formula for encouraging economic growth. 
When the fat needs to be cut, we can’t have politicians 
in office that simply look to raise the debt cap. The current administration has offered short-term solutions to long-term problems and refused to recognize the long term conse-quences of its spending habits. 
Many economists are telling us we are nearing the point 
where the government will hit a debt ceiling. What we need, locally and nationally, are people willing to say enough is enough.

Candidate defends headquarter location
The Laboratory is a hub for some of 
the most intellectual, artistic, creative and 
dynamic minds I’ve ever encountered. I 
spend my entire time debating, discussing 
and theorizing with the many patrons that come. It is my political training ground.
If the Alligator Editorial Board took a 
little time to do some research, like real journalists do, they’d discover that I’ve  spent very little time at The Laboratory in recent weeks. Between working full time, meeting with constituents, canvassing, at-
tending county and city commission meet-
ings, organizing my campaign team and forming committees, I’ve only been able to stop by the Lab to meet with party mem-
bers and reporters.Larry and his wonderful staff at the Lab 
have been my supporters from the very 
beginning. I owe them everything, and they’ve asked for nothing.  Without them, there would be no Ozzy Angulo Cam-
paign.
If the Editorial Board has any more 
questions, you know where to find me.

Fire fee hurts property owners
Dear Mayor and City Commissioners,This letter is to protest your raising a 
new fire services assessment on citizens 
already suffering from lowered incomes, 
lowered property values and tough eco-nomic times. In some properties, there are up to 50 per-
cent vacancies, even after lowering rents 20 
percent and offering incentives. We all are 
struggling to pay the new higher city taxes and much higher insurance premiums. 
We are only able to continue by cutting 
our spending. 
If we could just raise rents as you raise 
taxes and special assessments all would be fine. 
But it is not possible, and all is not fine 
with the Gainesville city government.
Overspending and lower revenue does 
not justify raising special assessments. It does require cutting back on all spending by city government and citizens alike.

Honestly, what’s not to like about Canada? It doesn’t 
go to war (unless the US tells it to), its main export is ma-ple syrup (I may have just made that up) and Canadian Football League teams only get three downs, plus their 
fields are longer.
Thursday is Canada Day, and I’ll be showing pride for 
“America’s hat” by painting myself red, white and maple 
syrup.
While most of us know that you can order Chinese 
food  — from China — quicker than you can get an am-
bulance in Canada, what else is important to know about 
the nation that burned Washington, D.C., to the ground in the War of 1812?
Admittedly, Canada is America’s joke. Canada is the 
Jan Brady to America’s Marcia. 
Everybody always talks about Marcia, but no one no-
tices Jan.
Not to mention the fact Canada has plagued millions 
of teenage girls with the most painful disease since gonor-rhea – Bieberitis. 
Canada may be pacifists, but if they don’t get a hold of 
the 16-going-on-12-year-old, vocally-challenged star, then there’s going to be a musical war of Tupac vs. Notorious B.I.G. proportions.Then there’s Canada’s perpetual 
whining minority: the Quebecois. 
All the maddening Canucks have 
to do is complain, and the rest of 
Canada gives in to them. 
Sound like another minority that is constantly com-
plaining in America? (Yes, I’m talking about the politi-
cally correct, far-left, anti-everything, we-don’t-watch-
South-Park idiots.) 
And UF, the beacon of cultural education and learning 
about the world, does a bang-up job of teaching Gators about America’s neighbor. 
The only regularly offered classes you can take at UF 
about Canada are Canadian politics and geography of the United States and Canada. Neither of those are offered 
this fall.
But don’t worry, just because Canada is the second 
largest nation in the world in land mass and our neighbor 
doesn’t mean we should know anything about it.
We just need to know how to make funny jokes about 
the globally insignificant allies of everyone. And we get 
that knowledge by listening to Weird Al’s “Canadian 
Idiot.”
Why should college graduates even know how many 
provinces Canada has (10 provinces, three territories) or 
when they earned complete independence from England (it was 1982)?
All that’s important to know is that Sidney Crosby stole 
a gold medal from the USA. And that’s un-American. 
But if you want an excuse to light off fireworks a few 
days early, then you need to know at least a few things 
about Canada Day.
Canada doesn’t have a real national anthem. They 
have three official versions of “O Canada,” but whenever they feel like it, they change it again. It can be made more militaristic or casual depending on the setting. So instead of singing the official “O Canada,” make up your own lyr-ics.
If you’re feeling patriotic, try watching the Toronto 
Blue Jays, because believe it or not Canada has been at war with America since 1977, when the Jays began play-ing in Major League Baseball. 
If you want to defend American pride, then pray Can-
ada doesn’t take over America’s game when the Blue Jays take on the Cleveland Indians.
Canada Day symbolizes the start of the Canadian Foot-
ball League. How genius is that? 
Why don’t we start the NFL on the Fourth of July? It 
would definitely make me feel a lot more American. But since we don’t have any good, hard-hitting American 
football on the Fourth of July, watch the CFL and appreci-
ate its hose-headed, yet challenging demeanor.

The tours have attracted more fac-

Howard said.
The Creative B events aren’t focused 
toward age-specific groups, rather the 
events are intended to bring in people with similar interests, he said.
Creative B is also hosting events 
like the video gaming tournament, which will be sponsored by the Digital Worlds Institute at the Old Norman

“The gaming tournament will

they’re freshmen or seniors,” he said.
Creative B is also offering three 
interdisciplinary courses. The first is Interactive Storytelling, a three-credit course offered by the Digital Worlds Institute. The second is America at 
Work: Get a Job, a one-credit course 
that coincides with a summer exhibit at the Harn Museum of Art. The third is Performance and Engagement, a three-credit course with the School of 
Theatre and Dance about how people 
make performances in everyday life, not just on stage.
UF is growing, and Creative B 
should help students see how science and art can meet, Howard said.
“Part of the conversation is bring-
ing artists and scholars from across campus to study in an interdisciplin-ary context,” he said.Creative B aims to show how art,

“I don’t feel threatened at all,” she said. 
“We built a foundation, and the people who 
come to us are going to continue to come to us.”Anthony Rue, who owns Volta Coffee, Tea 
& Chocolate in downtown Gainesville, said he thinks the move will hurt Starbucks because they won’t serve customers as quickly. Volta has more room for people to lounge than Star-
bucks does, so if people camp out at Starbucks, 
there won’t be a place to sit, he said.
Kristin Allukian, an English graduate stu-
dent at UF and a regular Starbucks customer, said Starbucks offers benefits that some of the locally-owned shops don’t. Because Starbucks operates on such a large scale, they aren’t as dependent on customer turnover, she said.
“I feel like I could stay here all day and 
have free refills and unlimited parking, and nobody would notice,” she said.
Wesley Kokomoor, a UF nu-
clear engineering graduate stu-dent, said he has long accessed Internet at Starbucks by buying 
gift cards for items he would have ordered anyway. Previously, customers who bought a gift card for more than $5 could get online for two hours.Starbucks is simply catching up to the rest 
of the industry and the rest of the world, UF Economics Chair Jonathan Hamilton said. Starbucks has offered free wireless in Europe for years, he said. 
The decision to offer free Internet in the 
United States could be a response to McDon-ald’s attempt to capture some of the coffee market, he said. 
McDonald’s launched its McCafe cam-
paign in May of 2009, and began to offer free wireless Internet in January of this year.

business hasn’t seen any direct effect 
as of now.
Bill Rys, tax counsel for the Na-
tional Federation of Independent Businesses said the new tax will re-
duce business.
“Higher taxes mean less invest-
ment, reduced growth and fewer 
customers — hardly the prescrip-
tion for future job growth our coun-
try needs,” Rys said.
Allison DeGroat, a UF biology 
junior, said the positives of the new 
tanning tax outweigh the negatives.
“I believe this newly enforced 
taxation will cause some tanning-bed clients to limit their tanning 
frequency, which will decrease their 
chances of developing skin cancer,” DeGroat said. 
DeGroat said she thinks being 
tan makes her look better, healthier and more vibrant, but still thinks the new tax is fair.TAN , from page 1

A helpful guide on how to not piss off your bartenders 
By THOMAS PLEVIK
avenue contributing writer
Gainesville is crammed with bars, 
and this Fourth of July weekend you 
will no doubt encounter throngs of 
sloppy drunks ready to join you in the never-ending war against joyless, American sobriety.
It’s a free world, and you can run 
with any crowd you like. But remem -
ber, no matter where you go or who you choose to slop with, in every bar you will run into the one omnipotent, 
super force: the bartender.
Out of all the “friends” you could 
possibly make during the evening, 
bartenders are (obviously) the most helpful. 
To help you stay the friendly, well-
liked mini-alcoholic that you are, here are five things you can do to avoid annoying that singular, supreme god 
of drinks.
1. Know what you want before you 
order:
Think of a bartender as the main-
tenance person for a well-oiled ma-chine.  
If your head is so full of non-al -
cohol-related garbage that you can’t even cough up the words to place 
your order when the time comes, 
you’re just slowing down the entire process and keeping good people from getting (watered-down) drinks.
2. Keep your money in your hand 
and let your eyes do the talking:
Bartenders get your drinks faster 
if you let them know you mean busi-
ness. 
Remember that your cash can 
shout down any bartender better 
than your  can.
“Don’t wave me down. We’re sell -
ing drinks, not hawking fat backs,” Joel Bryant, the resident spirit sling-er at University Club and six-year vet-eran of the business, said. 
“Don’t call my name, and please 
have money in your hands because all we ever see is your money,”  Bry -
ant said.
Also, eye contact and a friendly 
smile go a long way in letting the bar -
tender know you are not a pompous jerk. 
Former bartender Kim Wallace 
from the 2nd Street Speakeasy agrees that anyone waving his or her arms and acting impatient is going to wait much longer.3. Be aware of your surroundings:
You look like an idiot when you 
ask what beers are on tap when the handles are a foot away from your 
face. 
Knowing where to stand will help 
the bartender serve easier, and help 
you both avoid needless confusion.
“Stay in front of the well,”  Bryant 
said. “It’s much easier to get to you, 
and you know I’ll be back there in a minute.”
When the 
bar starts to fill with people,keep drinks simple – nothing more 
complicated than a two-mix cocktail, and the bartender will know you’re working for them and not against them.
A bar is like an altar for many bar -
tenders. 
If you think you’re an alcoholic an-
gel in a heaven of your own drunken bliss, then the bartender is God, and 
he wants you to respect his space.
4. Acting sloppy guarantees your 
next visit will be a bummer:Going to the bathroom after a 
couple of hours of sipping on the sauce can be a lot like walking off a carnival ride. There is a lot of uneasy swaying, and mostly you just want 
something solid to sit on. Somehow, 
though, you make it to the next at -
traction.
If you can resist the urge to puke 
in public and keep your overflowing 
personality to a minimum, you’ll have 
earned the respect and gratitude of the bartender.
Clean up after yourself a little, 
and the bartender will have that 
much more time to pour you a drink.
Keep your friends close. If you’re 
too sloshed to head out the door at 
closing time you become the bar’s 
problem, and that can keep every -
one late. 
It’s something you can be sure 
the bartender won’t forget the next time you walk up to his or her bar.
5. You will never flirt your way to a 
free drink:
Unless you are sucking the last 
drops of alcohol left on planet Earth, your kiss is never worth the price of a drink. 
Give it up, because it’s a bartend -er’s job to deal with a new booze 
hound every 30 seconds and every 
one of them wants to drink for free.
Everyone on stage or behind the 
bar is 50 percent better looking, ac-
cording to the 86 rules of Boozing. 
They know it, and if you try to flirt up a free martini they are probably go-ing to flirt a 30 percent tip right out of your pocket book.
Bartending is an equal gender of -
fender: women bartenders deal with obnoxious flirts as much as their male counterparts.
Bryant scoffs at the idea of allow -
ing anyone a free drink just because they look good in a dress shirt. 
Bryant is steadfast in his pay-as-
you-partake policy.
“It gets fierce in here,” said Bry -
ant. “Be a man in a gay bar and be a bartender. Girls have it easy because men are fierce.”
Moments later, a University Club 
regular teasingly offers Bryant pic-tures of his genitals in exchange for a tumbler of whiskey.
“You see this shit,” laughs Bryant, 
ignoring the man’s cries for more whiskey. 
“This is the shit I have to deal 
with. Don’t ever be this guy!”

  Fireworks, patriotism and guns! 
It’s the Fourth of July, and the best 
way to enjoy the   aforementioned Americana is with a drink in your hand.
  It shouldn’t surprise anyone that 
my weapon of choice is a frosty beer. I prefer the warmth provid-ed by a cold brew over the hassle of mixing colorful drinks anyday. 
However, the fourth of july affords 
special circumstances, and as your loyal alcohol connoisseur, I'd like to impart some variations on a theme that might just kick that barbecue 
into party overdrive. 
First, you want to be sure the 
beer you're drinking is representa-
tive of the glorious U.S. of A, and 
that you're not lining some Euro-
pean fat cat's pockets.
Yuengling is America’s   oldest 
brewery, founded in 1829, and 
Sam Adams is, by its name alone, 
the brewer and the patriot.
  Anchor Steam was born and 
raised in the USA and comes from 
one of America’s ﬁ  rst successful 
  microbreweries, which also makes 
Anchor Liberty Ale. 
Here's a word of warning, my 
patriot friends: Budweiser,   Miller and Coors are all at least partially 
owned by foreign companies. 
  Another good idea for your Inde-
pendence Day drinking is layered 
drinks. With a bit of   technique, you 
can pour layers of red, white and 
blue liquors or mixers. 
To do this, try to determine   the 
density of your alcohols. If you’re short a hydrometer, you can always 
experiment until you ﬁ  gure   it out. 
Pour your heaviest drink into the bottom of a glass and wait a min-ute or so for it to settle.
  Carefully pouring over the back 
of a spoon to protect the bottom layer, ﬂ  oat your next heaviest liquor   on top. 
Once the drink settles, pour your 
third the same way. It might take some practice, but it will be   worth it in the end. Worst-case scenario, 
line up a shot of each for a more 
horizontal and less difﬁ  cult   tricolor effect.
  For those without steady hands 
or patience, it’s easier to layer red, white and blue Jell-O   shots. Just mix and cool the colors one at a time, adding them on top as you go. 
For the white layer,   consider a 
mix of cream, sugar, vanilla, coco-nut rum and gelatin for extra ﬂ  avor and texture.
  Whether you celebrate our na-
tion’s birth with beer, liquor, Jell-O shots or even soft drinks, make   sure you exercise caution around 
explosives, campﬁ  res and spar-
klers. You know what they say: “It’s   all fun and games until someone loses an eye or a testicle.”

The Second Amendment: a love story (with guns) 
By ALEX ORLANDO
avenue writer
I know you’ve been waiting for 
it: the weekend of booze, fireworks 
and watermelon in celebration of our country that looms at the end of this first week of Summer B.
But before you do all that gal-
livanting at the possible expense of a friend’s fiery death, let’s take a minute to look back at one of the amendments our country was built 
on and how it’s standing today.
I’m going conservative as all get 
out on this one, but I’m talking about 
the Second Amendment.
You should reflect on the fact that 
until Monday of this week, your lo -
cal government could take that right away from you.
If you’ve been following any kind 
of news source this week, you’d 
know that the Supreme Court struck 
down Chicago’s handgun ban and 
enforced the Second Amendment over all future jurisdiction.
As a college student, I feel like I’m 
supposed to be a pretentious liberal 
punk and take Chicago’s side. On the 
other hand, being a kid from North Florida who hangs out in the boon -
docks that surrounds Gainesville, I 
feel like I should side with the court’s 
decision.
Maybe say something along the lines of, “Hell yeah, we should bear 
our arms! What if that evil Obama 
starts infringin’ on our rights, and we 
gotta start a militia?”
I’ll be up-front with you guys. I 
stand by the Second Amendment, but not for any of that ultra-aggres -
sive, conservative malarkey. Guns are just so damn fun to shoot.
And being a guy from Alachua – 
or an ACR as you out-of-towners love to call us – I had the opportunity last weekend to drive out to my buddy’s farm and blast my Second Amend -
ment enthusiasm through all kinds of targets.
About five of my closest friends 
and I set up under a gazebo at the edge of his 100-acre property with seven guns, four targets and enough ammo to sink a small boat.
When it was my turn to shoot, I 
grabbed my friend’s .44 Magnum that I had been eyeing all day.
Yes, the one from “Dirty Harry” 
that will “blow your head clean off.”
And being the pun-filled jerk that 
I am, I feel it is my duty to add that it really did make my day.
All stupidity aside, aiming that 
hand-cannon around the pasture, I couldn’t help but notice the sense of power that coursed  through me.

Fanfares and Fireworks show returns to Flavet Field 
� THE EVENT WAS CANCELED IN 2009 
DUE TO LACK OF FUNDING.
By ERIN RAUCH
avenue writer
Gainesville’s only annual fireworks display is 
bursting back to life with help from local spon-
sors. 
Fanfares and Fireworks was canceled in 
2009 due to a lack of funding. UF and the state 
legislature cut the budget for the event, accord-
ing to a press release.
“It has become a tradition for many families, so they were very disappointed,” Sue Wagner, di-rector of communications at WUFT-TV/DT, said.
The 20-year tradition recommences Saturday, 
starting at 7 p.m. at the UF bandshell at Flavet Field. Wagner said the event is scheduled on the 
third so families can participate in other Indepen-
dence Day events.
Conchita Ruiz-Topinka, spokeswoman for 
AvMed Health Plans, said the not-for-profit or -
ganization decided to step in when it heard the event was in trouble financially.
“We like to get involved in the communities 
and the markets that we serve,” Ruiz-Topinka said. “We have a significant presence in Gainesville with about 350 employees.”
The annual Independence Day celebration 
is sponsored by AvMed Health Plans, UF, the University Athletic Association and the City of Gainesville.
“Traditionally, it’s been a great event,” said 
Mike Hill, associate athletics director. “We are just proud to play a small part of this as WUFT relaunches it.”
The event is free and open to the public. Wag-
ner said families and students come and picnic in the grass, listen to music and watch the fire -
works.
Coolers are allowed at the event but may be subject to search by the University Police Depart-ment. Concessions will be available for purchase. No dogs, sparklers or alcohol are allowed at the event.
Attendees can listen to live music performed 
by the 6th Street Rhythm and Blues Review, Hart-ley Leacock and the Collective Format Band and the Gainesville Community Band. The Gainesville Community Band will play for an hour throughout the fireworks display.
The fireworks display is presented by Skylight-
ers of Florida and will begin at 9:40 p.m., accord-ing to a press release. UPD estimates between 15,000 and 20,000 people will attend.Photo courtesy of Tom Davis

By ALISHA KINMAN
avenue writer
Famed West coast rock band 
Rooney is coming to Gainesville. 
The band, perhaps best known for 
the songs “I’m Shakin’” and “Blue -
side” in addition to its guest appear -
ance on “The O.C.,” will be stopping 
in Gainesville on July 8 to perform at Common Grounds and promote its new album, “Eureka.”
After recently splitting with its 
record label, the four-man band re -
leased its third full-length album on June 8. 
Ned Brower, Rooney’s drummer 
and vocalist, spoke with me about its new album and coast-to-coast tour. Brower said the idea for the title of 
the CD is based on California’s state seal, where it says “eureka” across 
the top of the emblem. To go with 
the title, the album cover resembles 
the state seal but with the four band-
mates posing in the background. 
In 1999, the band released its 
first CD, “Rooney,” that also showed off its California pride by designing 
the album cover to resemble Califor -
nia’s state flag. Other CD releases by 
Rooney include “Calling the World,” in 
2007, and “Wild One EP,” in 2009. 
But, unlike Rooney’s previous al-
bums, “Eureka” was produced after 
discontinuing its label contract with Geffen/Interscope Records. 
Splitting away from the label hasn’t taken away from the produc-tion or creativity of the CD, Brower said. If anything, the sounds in this 
album are coming from the band 
more literally. 
“Eureka” is the first album to be 
produced under Rooney’s personal label, California Dreamin’ Records. 
“You can hear the individual per -
formances and the voices better than 
before,” Brower said. 
When arranging the lyrics and 
songs, the band has made an effort 
to work as a group and take chances 
on new music styles. 
The music is more sophisticated 
in “Eureka,” Brower said. Some of the songs have a ‘70s jazz-rock feel 
while others give off a psychedelic vibe. 
Generally, Robert Schwartzman, 
the lead vocalist, writes the songs in his head, and the band arranges 
the music together. On occasion, the 
other three members, Ned Brower, 
Taylor Locke and Louie Stevens, will take turns brainstorming lyrics. 
Brower said it takes around two 
days to record each song. 
Recently, Rooney’s headlining 
single off “Eureka,” “I Can’t Get Enough,” made VH1’s Top 20 Count-
down premiere list online. 
“The music video is unlike any -
thing before,” Brower said. “There’s 
stunt rollerskating, animation and live action.” 
Rooney fan or not, the splits in roll-erskates, back-up dancers dressed in 1970s flare and vibrant neon colors that resemble the late ‘60s are sure 
to grab viewer’s attention. 
On June 16, Rooney kicked off its 
tour in San Diego, Calif. to promote 
“Eureka” and will finish in Austin, Texas, in August. 
If a show is coming up soon, re -
hearsals are taken seriously, Brower 
said. But, before each performance, 
Rooney gets ready to perform by vo -
cally warming up and doing a cheer 
before going on stage. 
With the upcoming Gainesville 
show a week away, I was curious to 
know what the West Coast natives knew about the town. 
“Tom Petty,” Brower said.music

aveToonDave’s ideal Fourth 
of July extravaganza
The Fourth of July. It’s possibly the 
greatest holiday that has ever existed. Some guys signed a 
piece of paper that brought the United States of America into existence, and 
more than two centuries later we com-
memorate that day in the most Ameri-can way: grilling, getting belligerently drunk and watching things explode. I love July Fourth because I’m a big fan of America. It’s pretty much the best country I’ve ever lived in. 
This is the country that gave the 
world sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll, and 
I plan on showing how much I appreci-
ate it by going all out this Sunday. I’ve decided to share some of my plans with you because I’m sure there are some of you out there who are inter -
ested in knowing what I’ll be up to (or, bored in class).
First, I’ll be replacing all the chicken 
at my barbecue with bald eagle meat. 
What better way to enjoy America then 
tasting the succulent flesh of our na-tional bird? Yes, you party pooper, I know it’s illegal to do that, because it’s an endangered species. 
To that, I ask: Where is your Ameri-
can spirit? You think the Boston Tea Party was legal? What if the Redcoats said they were an endangered spe -
cies? We’d all be drinking tea at 4 p.m. every day instead of beer and plac-ing extra u’s in words where we don’t need them. (One special tip for 
cooking bald 
eagle: Throw some olive branches on the grill with it. 
You thought that bird was majestic to look at? One bite of an eagle wing, and that flavor will make you stand up and salute Old Glory.)
To further spice up my Fourth, I’m 
breaking out the big guns – literally. As part of my fireworks extravaganza, I’ve refurbished an actual cannon that was used in the Revolutionary War and plan on firing it along University Avenue (weather permitting). 
I love the Fourth of July because 
we get to smack talk the British all we 
want. Hey, England! You suck at soc-
cer, just like you suck at maintaining sovereignty over your colonies!
I’d like to wrap up this week’s col-
umn by giving a special shout out to the new freshmen starting Summer B this week: Hey guys, what’s up? Quick tip: There is no secret pool on the roof of your dorm. You know where there is 
a pool, though? My house. I’m over 21, 
too. Hit me up on Facebook, ladies.

TEEING OFF TOM GREEN UF VOLLEYBALL UF BASEBALL
� NBA free agency started at midnight and within a week we will all know
the answer to the biggest question of the offseason: where will Brian Scalabrine 
sign? ... Elin Woods will receive $750 million in her divorce from Tiger Woods in the aftermath of the golfer’s sexual exploits -- sexploits, if you will -- meaning she will now get paid more for doing nothing than Stephon Marbury ever did.� UF freshman shortstop Nolan 
Fontana was named to the Rawl -
ings NCAA Division I Gold Glove Team on Wednesday. He was the lone freshman chosen this season. � It was announced on Wednesday that 
outside hitters Stephanie Ferrell and Cinthya Roberto, and opposite hitter Tangerine Wiggs have all transferred to UF. Roberto is a two-time junior college All-American.Tim Casey / GatorCountry.com
Five-star recruit Patric Young comes to UF with experience from playing on the USA Men’s U-18 National Team. They won the gold medal Wednesday.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator.org
 
Patric Young’s classes 
started on Monday, but he 
isn’t in Gainesville yet.
The incoming Gators bas-
ketball freshman has a good 
excuse. Young won’t arrive to 
campus until today because 
he has been in San Antonio playing for the USA Men’s Basketball U-18 National Team. The squad beat Brazil 
81-78 on Wednesday to win 
the gold medal.
“I definitely was humbled 
a little bit coming out here to 
understand how the game 
is going to be played at the next level,” Young said. “It’s a lot more physical and the referees are going to let you 
play a lot more and coaches 
expect so much more from you as far as being on time and taking notes during film 
sessions.”
The rapid development 
of the 6-foot-9-inch low-
post presence will be vital to Florida this season. Young, a 
five-star recruit and the fifth-
ranked center in the 2010 recruiting class according to Rivals, is expected to provide 
a solid option at both the 
power forward and center positions right away.
“I think coach Donovan is 
going to have me come onto 
the team as a freshman and 
have an immediate role on the team,” he said. “I think I’ll come in as a role player 
looking to rebound a lot. I’m 
banking on maybe (my soph-omore season) will be my year to shine.”
Not known as a scorer, 
Young averaged 14.2 points per game to go along with 12.4 rebounds and 3.2 blocks as a senior. 
The Jacksonville native 
expects to provide defense and help on the boards with guards Erving Walker and Kenny Boynton taking care of the scoring. Many are looking at Young to join ris-
ing sophomore Erik Murphy 
as the two primary frontcourt reserves.
“(Young is) a guy that is a 
very aggressive player, he’s very physical,” UF coach Billy Donovan said. “I think his offense will grow and get better as time goes on, but I 
think the one thing he brings 
to our team right away is great energy and passion and a physical presence.”
The person who is respon-
sible for Young’s decision to come to UF is not with the Gators anymore. According to Young, former UF assistant 
and new VCU head coach 
Shaka Smart is the one who convinced the recruit that Gainesville was the place he 
would most flourish in. But 
once he committed, he didn’t want to be one of those play-ers to change his mind, so he never second-guessed his de-
cision after Smart left.
Young has high expec-
tations when he steps onto 
campus today. He isn’t shy 
about predicting where the 
Gators, which are returning their entire starting five, will end up.
“It’s funny because (Mar-
reese) Speights actually tweeted that the Gators are going to be in the Final Four this year,” he said. “I think 
we have all the talent to make 
it that far and I think I’ll play a big role in helping us get there.” Young ready to contribute

UF basketball commitment

National Signing Day may be seven 
months away, but the Gators took strides 
during the month of June toward building 
another strong football recruiting class.
After coming into June with just four  
commitments, Florida received solid verbals from six prospects last month to push the 2011 recruiting class to a total of 10 commit-ments so far. 
The six commitments in June are more 
than any other Southeastern Conference 
school and in-state rivals UM and FSU.
Among the verbal commitments the 
Gators received last month, two came from four-star recruits and three came from three-
star recruits, as rated by Rivals.
Florida started the month slow on the 
recruiting trail, not landing a commitment until nearly two weeks in when Lakeland’s four-star wide receiver Javares McRoy de-committed from Texas Tech, where he origi-
nally committed with his older brother Ben-
jamin – a three-star athlete.
“I just thought about where I really 
wanted to go and what best fit me and my 
running style, and UF fits my style,” McRoy 
told The Lakeland Ledger last month.
McRoy became the Gators’ first skill posi-
tion commitment of the 2011 class and the first Lakeland prospect to commit to UF 
since 2007, when the Gators signed Mike 
and Maurkice Pouncey, Ahmad Black and Chris Rainey.
After McRoy’s commitment to the Gators, 
the ball kept rolling along the recruiting trail 
and five more prospects verbally pledged to 
play for UF in 2011.
On June 17, three-star fullback, Hunter 
Joyer, accepted a scholarship 
offer from Florida after his 
showing at coach Urban Mey-er’s football camp that week. 
The 6-foot, 245-pound Joy-
er is rated No. 1 overall at his 
position by Rivals and ran for 1,030 yards and 10 touchdowns for Tampa Catholic in 2008.
His commitment is peculiar, considering 
how little Meyer has used fullbacks dur-ing his tenure at Florida, but could point to the Gators deploying the I-formation more in the coming years with quarterback John Brantley under center.
Four days after Joyer gave his verbal to 
the Gators, they landed two more recruits in 
Tommy Jordan, an offensive lineman from 
Ridgefield, Conn., and Plantation linebacker Ryan Shazier.
Jordan is a three-star nose guard prospect 
who committed to Florida after visiting the football camp last month.
Shazier, the other four-star prospect the 
team landed in June, recorded 87 tackles and 19 sacks as a junior last year for the Colo-
nels. 
The linebacker, who is rated as the ninth-
best at his position by Rivals, visited the 
school with his family last month and com-
mitted to the Gators shortly thereafter.Busy month lands Gators six verbal commitments

WIMBLEDON, England – For 
the first time in eight years, Roger 
Federer won’t be striding onto Cen-tre Court for the Wimbledon final.
The six-time champion was up-
set in the quarterfinals by big-hitting Tomas Berdych on Wednesday, 
stopping his bid for a record-tying 
seventh title at the All England Club and extending his recent stretch of 
disappointing play.
The 12th-seeded Berdych used 
his big serve and forehand to beat Federer 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, on Centre 
Court for the biggest victory of the Czech’s career.
It’s the first time since 2002 that 
Federer has failed to reach the final.
Winner of a record 16 Grand 
Slam titles, Federer said he was un-able to play his best tennis Wednes-day because of pain in his back and 
right leg.
“I am struggling with a little bit of 
a back and a leg issue,” Federer said. “That just doesn’t quite allow me to 
play the way I would like to play. It’s frustrating, to say the least.”
Berdych said he didn’t notice 
anything wrong with Federer dur-ing the match.
“I don’t know if he is just look-
ing for some excuses after the match or something like that,” he said. “I think he was 100 percent ready.”
Berdych ripped a clean forehand 
winner on his second match point to become the first Czech to reach the men’s semifinals since Ivan Lendl in 
1990.
With the loss, Federer will drop 
to No. 3 in the ATP rankings next week for the first time since Nov. 10, 
2003. Since winning the Australian Open in January, he has failed to 
win a tournament.
Federer said his leg and back 
have been bothering him 
since the grass-court tourna-
ment in Halle, Germany, the week before Wimbledon.
“When you’re hurting, it’s just 
a combination of many things,” Federer said. “You just don’t feel as comfortable. You can’t concentrate 
on each and every point because 
you do feel the pain sometimes.”
Federer was playing in his 25th 
consecutive Grand Slam quarter-final. He had won 23 straight, but now has lost two in a row. Federer 
fell to Soderling at the French Open 
earlier this month.
Federer was clearly outplayed 
Wednesday by a man who has al-ways possessed enormous talent but often failed to live up to expec-
tations.
“He played well when he had 
to,” Federer said. “It was brutal for me. Every time he had a chance, 
he took it. On the break points, he played great on those. ... When I did have chances, I played poorly. It was 
just a frustrating match the way it all 
went.”
Berdych broke Federer four 
times, with the final one coming in the seventh game of the fourth set. Berdych served 12 aces, was broken just once and saved seven of eight 
break points.
“I don’t think I played poorly,” 
Federer said. “I think he went af-ter it. I know Berdych. I think I’ve 
played him 10 times already before. That’s the way he plays.”22, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JULY 1, 2010

Three-star WR Story committed to play for UF over 22 other schools
According to The Gainesville Sun, Shazi-
er said Meyer was “excited” by his commit-
ment and thanked him for it.
Florida’s June recruiting surge came 
to a climax on Monday when it gained its fifth and sixth verbal commitments of the month.
Nature Coast wide receiver Ja’Juan Story 
gave his verbal to UF on Monday, shunning scholarship offers from at least 22 schools, including five other SEC schools and UF’s in-state rivals FSU and UM.
Story, who joins McRoy as the Gators’ 
only two wide receiver commitments thus far for 2011, brings even more speed to Mey-er’s offense, as he runs a 4.4 40-yard dash, 
according to Rivals.
As a junior, Story caught 13 passes for 423 
yards and three touchdowns while rushing 
for 265 yards and two scores on 27 carries. He 
also recorded 22 tackles and one sack while 
playing defensive back for the Sharks.
Story could play on either side of the 
ball for the Gators by the time 2011 comes around, but will be playing quarterback at Nature Coast this coming season as a se-
nior.
The same day Story 
committed to Florida, the 
Gators also landed their 
tenth recruit for 2011 – one that wasn’t even on their 
radar at the beginning of 
the month.
Kicker Kyle Christy of 
Brownsburg, Ind., committed to UF after re-
ceiving an offer Monday night.Christy wasn’t recruited by UF until he 
attended the team’s kicking camp that took place from June 21-23.
 “I talked to Urban Meyer and he said 
they actually had three or four guys there 
specifically just to look at them, and I wasn’t 
one of those guys,” Christy said. “But I stole the show.”
Christy said he impressed coaches with 
his punting and called them Monday night. It was then they decided to offer him a schol-arship, which he quickly accepted over an offer from LSU. RECRUIT , from page 21NewsInternational

It is a sad day when you lose something 
that has been woven into a city’s iden-tity.
No, I am not talking about the possibil-
ity of LeBron James walking away from the Cleveland Cavaliers. 
This is about something even more 
ingrained into the prototypical idea of American sports. This is about something that has been a staple in our country for 61 years.
The book on Rosenblatt Stadium, home 
of the College World Series, was officially closed after South Carolina won the CWS title on a walk-off hit Tuesday.
The ballpark that sits on a hill in Oma-
ha, Neb., will soon be demolished in order to make way for a new state-of-the-art fa-cility. 
TD Ameritrade Park Omaha, a beauti-
ful 24,000-seat stadium that will become 
the new home of the CWS, is being built 
just three miles north of Rosenblatt.
Corporate executives are going to love 
the comfortable venue loaded with 30 lux-
ury suites and 1,000 club seats, but base-
ball fans won’t.
This move is a travesty. Unlike Rosenblatt, which is on the south side of Omaha in the middle of an empty field next to sports bars and famous eating spots, Ameritrade Park will be located in 
the downtown area.
When I made the trip to cover the CWS 
a couple of weeks ago, I saw what every-
body was talking about. It felt like what 
baseball is supposed to feel like.
Tailgaters surrounded the stadium 
and fans stood in lines for hours just for a 
chance at tickets to catch a glimpse of the action. 
If you didn’t know, college baseball 
doesn’t usually draw the biggest crowd. But in Omaha, it does.
Sure, Ameritrade Park will be in that 
same city, but things won’t be the same. 
As I drove by the semi-built stadium, I 
couldn’t help but notice the gigantic shad-ows projected onto Ameritrade Park by the sky-rise buildings looming over it. These 
money-making landmarks mark the end 
of tailgating alongside the stadium and the famous eating spots like Zesto’s Drive-in, a legendary burger and milkshake joint lo-
cated next to Rosenblatt which makes 80 to 
90 percent of its profit during the CWS.
This is just one of the factors that played 
into the fans’ decision to boo Omaha May-or Jim Suttle at the opening ceremonies.
But let’s just think 
about the logistics of this move. 
The Omaha Royals, 
a minor league affili-
ate of the Kansas City 
Royals, call Rosenb-latt their home, too. 
But they aren’t following the CWS to Ameritrade Park because they thought it 
would be too big for them. Instead, anoth-
er stadium is being built for the Royals.
That’s right, two baseball stadiums 
within 20 minutes of each other are under 
construction simultaneously. They are ex-
pected to cost $154 million combined.
None of this makes any sense. 
There is something to be said about the 
feel of an old ballpark full of tradition that 
witnessed 61 years full of special CWS mo-ments, Robin Ventura’s NCAA-record 58 game hitting streak come to an end and 
thousands upon thousands of fans travel to 
a part of Omaha that is not often visited if it 
isn’t for the CWS.
The ballpark was not even in bad shape. 
I had the opportunity to walk around the stadium multiple times and sit in the crowd 
to watch some of the games, and everything 
was in good condition by my standards.
Rosenblatt looked as pretty as ever. It 
seemed to be freshly painted and all of the 
facilities were up to the times.
I know the CWS can’t be played in Rosen-
blatt forever, but it just doesn’t seem like their is a reason to change sites right now.
What is going to happen to the nearby 
restaurant owners which wait all year for 
the CWS to come around to make their prof-
its? What is going to happen to the house 
next to Rosenblatt whose residents earn over a $1,000 a year from parking cars in their yard?
A lot of people are going to feel the ef-
fects of this loss, not only baseball fans. 
But once the old ballpark is demolished, 
there is no looking back.
Instead, the adjacent Henry Doorly 
Zoo, one of the top zoos in the country, 
will take control of the sacred land once the ballpark is knocked down. A little league replica of Rosenblatt will be built on the site, too.
This mini version of the stadium seems 
fitting with all of the childish politics that went into this decision.Decision to move CWS from Rosenblatt Stadium a foolish one

Dwyane Wade became a free agent today. The Heat are confident they can 
re-sign Wade, who has already scheduled visits with other teams.  
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
MIAMI — Dwyane Wade now has his own coun-
ty.
The Miami Heat will soon learn if they remain the 
center of Wade’s world.
While hundreds of people yelled for him at a rally 
in Miami on Wednesday, Wade was in Chicago, go-
ing through final preparations for a free agency pe-riod like no other in NBA history. He’ll begin hear-ing from teams in today’s early hours, with the first wave of meetings expected later today.
And when Wade spoke Wednesday to former 
teammate Alonzo Mourning, the 2006 NBA finals MVP said he’s anxious for both the process to begin 
— and the process to end, too.
“Very much so,” said Mourning, now a Heat ex-
ecutive. “Very, very much so.”
In Miami, taking over the downstairs of a govern-
mental office complex, well-wishers waved signs, 
wrote messages to Wade on an oversized card and donned T-shirts with the logo of Miami-Dade Coun-ty — which, until July 8, will be renamed Miami-Wade County, even with the colors redone to match 
the Heat’s red and black scheme.
Mourning egged on the crowd, imploring them 
to chant and scream.
“The best,” Mourning promised, “is yet to 
come.”
That’s the same thought going through the mind 
of Heat president Pat Riley, who has waited and 
planned for years for this day.
Riley planned to make the ceremonial 12:01 
a.m. recruiting call to Wade, who will automati-cally become a free agent without having to declare 
his intention. Riley and other members of the Heat 
organization departed Wednesday for California, where the Heat were expected to try to see Amare Stoudemire, Carlos Boozer and others once the free-
agent window officially opened.And on Thursday, Riley’s private jet will almost 
certainly leave California for Ohio, where LeBron 
James — the headliner of headliners in this free-agent class — is likely to accept Miami’s offer to meet.
It’s unknown when Riley will meet with Chris 
Bosh, who over the weekend told The Associated Press that he has high interest in Miami.
“You have some individuals who have increased 
their chances of getting there and winning it all,” Mourning said. Meanwhile, Wade is expected to meet with the Knicks and Nets on Friday, either in New York or Chicago. Either way, Wade will return to South Florida next week.
“This is a rarity,” Mourning said. “This doesn’t 
happen, man, when you have this level of free agents available. There’s a frenzy. ... So none of this surpris-
es me at all.”
Miami only has two players under contract for 
next season at this point, guard Mario Chalmers and 
forward Michael Beasley. They’ve been working out together at the Heat facility, neither having any idea who will be in the locker room with them when camp starts in about three months.
It’s an odd situation, for sure.“You don’t know who’s going to be here,” Chal-
mers said. “So we just have to step our games up. For now, it’s just me, Mike and D-Wade.”
That is, if Wade stays put.Mourning told the people at the Wade rally that 
the team expects the former NBA scoring champion to stay and is increasingly confident it will happen. That would mean Riley believes he can make the roster upgrades Wade wants, because without them, Wade said he would look elsewhere.
“Pat Riley is a company guy,” Mourning said. 
“He’s going to do what he can to make sure the orga-nization is successful. I can’t read Pat’s mind, but in my 16 years of being around this man, I do know he’s going to do everything remotely possible to bring a world championship back to this organization.Heat hope to re-sign WadeNATIONAl bASkETbAll ASSOCIATION
