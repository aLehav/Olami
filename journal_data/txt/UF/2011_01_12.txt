Gainesville police are still searching for two 
robbers who ran away after holding a man at 
gunpoint Monday evening.
At about 8 p.m., the victim, whose name has 
not been released, was approached by two men as he was walking down the stairs from his home in Gainesville Place Apartments, at 2800 SW 35th Place, said GPD spokeswoman Tscharna Senn.
One of the men pulled a gun on the victim 
and demanded he hand over whatever he had. 
The victim gave up his cell phone before the robbers ran away , Senn said. The victim called police, who arrived shortly afterward but were unable to apprehend the criminals.
Senn said the robbers are described as black 
men, between 5’8” and 5’11” tall. One was wear -
ing long black shorts and a black shirt.  The other was wearing a tight skin cap. Anyone who in-formation about the crime is asked to call GPD at 352-393-7670 or Crime Stoppers to leave an anonymous tip at 352-372-7867.

Funding for sheltering the homeless on 
freezing cold nights is running low.
After 45 nights of sub-45-degree weath-
er, the Alachua County Housing Authority 
has about $600 and the St. Francis House has about $8,000 remaining in their cold weather budgets.
Kent Vann, executive director of the St. 
Francis House, said depending on how many cold nights this week brings, money will probably last the shelter about two more weeks.
Gail Monahan, executive director of 
the Alachua County Housing Authority, said many families who have been evicted 
come to her for shelter. 
“I think one of the most 
frightening things for me is we’ve housed 20 children,” 
she said. “We have never housed children before.”
City Commissioners will vote on Jan. 
20 to give more money to these shelters, and the Alachua County Commission will vote to match the amount the city appro-priates.
The St. Francis House, which is bud-
geted for less than $11 per extra person, has housed 1,643 people from November to January. The Alachua County Housing Authority, which is given about $30 per person, has put about 84 people in low-cost motels.
Rodney Long, Alachua County com -
missioner, said that he hopes the necessary funding passes as soon as possible to make sure shelter for cold nights continues.
“It is going to be extremely cold up un-
til March or April,” he said. “We cannot have a tragedy in our community.”Dwindling

It’s a number Sky Georges doesn’t 
have much use for. He has no need for it; 
he wouldn’t know what to do with it if he ever found it. Truth be told, it bewilders him.
“Hey man, you’re late for tabling.”Although he doesn’t realize it, it lin-
gers. Like the gusts of wind that whip off him as he darts back and forth between Turlington Plaza and the Reitz Union on a morning that looks more like purgatory than Tuesday. It rudely sneaks up, takes its best swing then drifts away.
“Does anyone know where our posters 
are?” 
He works. He works because that’s 
what makes  its call silent. “Dwell...dwell...dwell,” it tells him.
Yet no matter how many fliers he gives 
out or how many hands he shakes, he can’t avoid it. 
Today is its day . Jan. 12 marks the first  anniversary of 
the earthquake that tore through Haiti, an event that left thousands dead, billions of dollars in damage and a countless number of people asking why . 
Georges, the president of Gators United 
for Haiti, an organization dedicated to re-lief and raising awareness for the tiny Ca-ribbean nation, doesn’t think about those 
questions — at least not anymore. He has a job to do: make people care. Not the kind of care that is confined to a lapel ribbon or soothing lip service. He’s look-ing for the kind of care 
that will get people off the couch, get involved 
and maybe, if they’re crazy enough, run back and forth across campus like he’s doing now. It’s that care, Georges hopes, that will help to make the tents filled with small children go away.
“Hey , you coming to our 5K? That’s 
awesome.”For Georges, “one” is a journey.

The hands on the clock are slowly creep-
ing toward seven and Ashton Charles is late for her Tuesday Senate meeting. Scur -
rying her way down the stairs of her so-rority house, her mind swirls with agenda items and procedures. The process isn’t new for the senate president, who has spent many years in the stuffy chambers in Room 282 at the Reitz Union pounding out resolutions at an inconceivable pace.
For Charles, these next few months will 
be the most important of her life. Many Student Government insiders presume she will be anointed the Unite Party can-didate for Student Body president, which means every move and every word will be heavily scrutinized and potentially used against her as a political point. The pres-sure is intense.
She almost reaches the door when she 
hears the gasp.

n DON DEVITO WAS NAMED TEACHER 
OF THE YEAR BY THE COUNCIL FOR EXCEPTIONAL CHILDREN.
By MORGAN WATKINS
Alligator Writer
As Don DeVito walks toward his music 
classroom at Sidney Lanier School, he hears 
his name and turns toward the sound. 
One of his colleagues walks toward him 
with a student, Lyndon, beside her. 
“It’s Lyndon’s birthday ,” the teacher says.  Lyndon thrusts his arms in front of him, 
motioning as if he were holding a pair of drumsticks. DeVito smiles and makes a drum-ming motion too, and Lyndon smiles at him. 
DeVito makes the sign for ‘happy birth-
day.’ Lyndon is 95 percent deaf and has cere-bral palsy, so this is the clearest way to con-gratulate him on turning 20. 
Lyndon returns to air drumming. DeVito 
pounds the air with an improvised drumbeat of his own — their own personal form of com-munication.
DeVito, who received his Ph.D. in music 
education from UF, has taught Lyndon for about seven years. While he may not be a typi-cal drummer, Lyndon has been practicing on his own set since he was seven. 
“He can only sign five words, but he can 
do this,” DeVito said of Lyndon’s talent for drumming.
In May 2010, DeVito even took him to play 
at Carnegie Hall. Lyndon was one of about 10 students who were able to go along with other musicians in the ensemble. Due to his work as music director at Sid-
ney Lanier, DeVito was given the Council for Exceptional Children’s national teacher of the year award for 2011, also known as the Clar -
issa Hug Award. 
As part of this honor, he will be the orga-
nization’s spokesman for the next year, giv-
ing speeches and even talking to members of 
Congress about special education issues.He heard the news while at a Beef ‘O’ Bra-
dy’s with his wife, Wendy . Standing outside the restaurant as he heard the news by phone, he couldn’t help but bounce up and down ea-gerly . 
“You would have thought the Gators 
scored a touchdown and won a champion-ship,” he said. 
DeVito has worked at Sidney Lanier for about a decade, giving his students an under -
standing of music that they can build upon each day . He uses tools like Skype, an online video service that can connect people whether they are a room away or an ocean apart, to in-troduce his students to other music teachers and students across the globe. 
They teach his students new songs and 
present class performances from a continent away . 
For DeVito, teaching is about the little 
things. When a boy who originally couldn’t grasp a drumstick learns how to play a steady beat, or a girl who has trouble speaking starts to sing her her favorite song, he feels like he is making a difference. 
“It’s (about) looking for the minute in a dif-
ferent way, but to me it’s all the more reward-ing,” he said. 
DeVito walks up to Evelyn, a brown-
haired girl with glasses and a gray sweatshirt embroidered with red and blue hearts. 
“This morning we had some swing mu-
sic, right, some Duke Ellington?” he asks the class. 
His students decide that they would like 
to play the drums along with Ellington’s “It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That 
Swing).” DeVito starts the music and grabs a 
portable drum.
As Evelyn holds one drumstick and De-
Vito grasps the other, they pound the drum in tandem. 
DeVito sits close to her, adding a few extra 
hits to liven up the beat as Evelyn drums along with him. Then he gently takes the drumstick from her, tells her she did a great job and of-
fers her a high five.

Senators celebrated Student Body President 
Ashton Charles at their Tuesday night meeting 
for her efforts to postpone the implementation of block tuition.
As president, Charles has a seat on the Board of 
Trustees, which met Dec. 10 to evaluate a proposal for block tuition.
“I was the only person to vote in opposition of 
block tuition,” Charles said.
While the proposal was not overturned, 
Charles’ presentation was enough to postpone the implementation of the policy by at least one more year.
Senate President Ben Meyers commended 
Charles for her presentation, calling the delay “no small victory.”
In the meeting, Senators also voted unanimous-
ly to supply $1,300 of funding to Doctors Without Borders, an international organization that helps provide medical aid to about 60 countries. UF’s chapter plans to organize a 5K and invite a guest speaker to promote awareness of world health is-sues.
Student Sen. Micah Lewis read a resolution 
honoring fallen Gators Jacob Snyder, Saleha Huu-da and Devon Richbell, followed by a moment of silence.
A second resolution in specific recognition of 
Saleha Huuda, whose death is being investigated as a homicide, chronicled her life and community involvement, including her work with the Fort 
Clarke Middle School cheerleaders and at The Vil-
lage assisted living community.Senators praise tuition delay

Gainesville Regional Utili-
ties is helping those who can’t 
afford to be energy efficient be-come so. 
The Low-Income Energy Ef-
ficiency Program, LEEP , is a free program for low-income house-holds to replace items such as 
water heaters and air condition-
ers to save money and energy.
Vanessa Aragon, a residen-
tial efficiency program coordi-nator with the company, said, 
on average, $3,000 is given for 
upgrades per household. 
Items such as water heaters, 
A/C systems, insulation, pro-
grammable thermostats and 
weather stripping can all be replaced under this program. Even light bulbs, she said.
Customers apply for the pro-
gram and must meet require-ments such as owning a home and ranking below 80 percent of the median family income, 
based on current Housing and 
Urban Development guidelines. For Gainesville, a four-person 
household income would be 
$49,050.
The program also applies to 
mobile homes and houses with mortgages. 
It was introduced in 2006 af-
ter the City Commission asked the company to create initia-tives to make Gainesville more energy efficient. 
The company realized that 
not all households were able to afford such items, even with GRU’s rebate system.
“Unfortunately, low-income 
customers did not have the funds or the means to make those improvements to reduce energy,” Aragon said.  
Since 2006, almost 500 homes 
have been upgraded.
“By offering these programs, 
making those improvements for them, we were able to save 
them energy on their end and 
ours, and then also save them money,” she said. 
Of those houses, an aver -
age 13 percent is saved on their 
monthly bill.
According to the City of 
Gainesville web-
site, $528,500 was 
allotted to the  
program from 
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. One-fourth of the cost for each home 
improvement is covered by that, 
and the rest is paid for by GRU.
Aragon said there is enough 
funding for 336 households 
this year and 276 spots are still 
available.
“Customers are always very 
excited and welcoming,” she said. “It’s a good and positive 
outcome.”Program helps boost

AS PART OF THE PEPSI REFRESH PROJECT.

Alligator Contributing Writer
The Pepsi Refresh Project at UF 
announced Dance Marathon at UF 
as the $15,000 grant winner Saturday 
night at the Gators men’s basketball game against University of Missis-sippi.
DM at UF, benefitting Children’s 
Miracle Network at Shands Chil-dren’s Hospital at UF, entered the competition last year to revamp the pediatric waiting area. 
DM is an event held April 2 and 3 
in which participants raise money by 
standing for 26.2 straight hours.
The Shands nurses approached 
Tracy Flack, one of the advisers who looked into the project, about using 
the money for the waiting area. 
“Twenty-one percent of all sur -
geries are pediatric,” Flack said. “That’s a big chunk. We want to set 
up games, movies and art projects for 
[the children] to not have to focus on the surgery.”
Because Shands will contribute 
money for the general needs of the waiting room, the $15,000 will be used to buy entertainment for the children and the families of the pa-tients.Dance 
Marathon receives

On the television are images of flattened 
buildings, the caption at the bottom, in a fu-
tile effort, tries to summarize what Charles sees in front of her. 
Haiti has been devastated by an earth-
quake. The death toll remains undeter -
mined. 
The news hits Charles like a stiff punch 
in the gut. Before her emotions can catch up to her, her sense of time and place scream 
at her. Away she goes to the Student Senate 
meeting.
As the minutes droll on, Charles can’t 
shake what she has seen. She planned to 
make an announcement, perhaps pass a 
resolution that would recognize what had 
just occurred. 
Then one of the senators, who appears 
visibly shaken, stands up.
As most of you know, an earthquake 
has hit Haiti today , the senator, who is of Haitian descent, says. At this time, I don’t 
know where my family is.
“Right there,” Charles said in an inter -
view, “my heart broke for him.” 
As news of the disaster begins to trickle 
in, Charles became more convinced that something — anything — needed to be done. That Wednesday, she went to an ad-hoc meeting that included administration, 
student club leaders and everyone else in 
between. The topic at hand: What now? 
For most of the meeting, Charles stayed 
silent as  students got up and told stories of lost relatives, broken buildings and an 
aching sense of uncertainty. What could a blonde girl from Kentucky , who had never even traveled to Haiti, have to offer?
Suddenly it jumped out of her: “I would 
love to help.”
Those words would kick-start what 
Charles described to be “one of the most proud moments of my life.” Her office slow-ly morphed into the unofficial Gators Unit-ed for Haiti headquarters. Working around the clock, Charles worked the phones, try-ing to get something to take shape. 
One year later, Gators United for Haiti 
has raised nearly $82,000. Charles, who would go on to win the SG presidency, con-tinues to stay involved in the cause with the hope that The Gator Nation will remember the Caribbean nation that is trying to re-build. 
So far, Charles remains optimistic. 
“I have a lot of faith in the Gator Nation 
that they will come through,” she said. “We 
have the capabilities to do great things.”
For her efforts, Charles received an award from Gators United for Haiti. In-
stead of a medal or trophy , it was a flimsy 
paper plate.
On the plate read “Haitian by Associa-
tion.”
Still
Hundreds of miles away from the circus 
that is college life, Jon Bougher sits in a or -
phanage eating rice and beans. 
It’s an early dinner for Bougher, who is 
down in Haiti shooting a documentary that 
he hopes to use for his master’s thesis at the Documentary Insti-tute. Relaxing, he sits 
with fellow filmmaker Roman Safiullin and John Dieubon, one of the main characters in Bougher’s film. 
Dieubon talks fast. He tells of his plans to 
erect new buildings. Bougher is filming the orphanages and schools that Dieubon and his partner, Aaron Jackson, are running.
Today had been different. Along with 
their usual coverage, he and Safiullin take a detour and decide to visit an old cemetery . 
They did this, Bougher said, to gain an 
appreciation for both the living and the dead. 
As dinner began to wind down, the 
ground began to shake. The building hold-ing the three men wobbled like Jell-o. Right about the time they comprehended what was taking place, it was over.
Then came the stillness — pure, rigid 
stillness. Following it were the sounds of buildings crumbling and screams of “Dead! Dead!” The few who were in the streets had their arms extended, eyes pointed toward 
the sky yelling, “Save me, Jesus! Save me!”
At a loss for words, Bougher and Safiul-
lin grabbed the camera and began shoot-
ing.
Looking back on it, Bougher, whose 
film was shown at UF on Tuesday , views that Jan. 12 as something more surreal than 
traumatic. His heart races whenever he 
feels something shake, but he doesn’t have 
any nightmares or flashbacks.  
He could tell you what it was like to live 
through it, but he would rather show you.

Georges, Charles and Bougher hope 
someday , and that day may not be for a long 
time, that Haiti will return to where it once was. Georges thinks that the country, driv-en by its youth, is well on its way. Bougher believes it will take years, maybe even a decade. All three conclude that, while there is still much work to be done, there are positive strides being made in both raising awareness and helping Haitians in need. 
At UF, both Georges and Charles hope 
their efforts to raise awareness for Haiti will spark  movements for other various causes. While they concede that the future may help fade the impact of what happened last January , they are confident people will remember the Haiti earthquake not for its morbid aftertaste but for the efforts made, the help sought and the promises fulfilled.
“This is not just a Haitian issue,” Charles 
said. “This is a people issue.”WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 12, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 5

Today’s question: Do you think textbooks are obsolete?
Blam! Pow! 
Maybe there are su-
perheroes among us. 
No, we don’t mean in 
the metaphorical sense, al-though the police and fire departments deserve re-
spect. 
We’re talking normal 
people donning capes, bul-
letproof vests and, in at least one case, a ballistics cup in 
an effort to clean up their 
neighborhood’s streets.
While we want to be 
logical and tell people like 
those in the Rain City Su-
perhero Movement, a cos-tumed group patrolling the streets of Seattle, to remove the bed sheets tied around 
their necks and just call the 
cops, we can’t help but love them. 
It’s admittedly refresh-
ing to see people trying to make a positive impact in a society that fosters apathy.
Maybe these people are 
intervening in muggings to emulate movies. Per -
haps they’re doing it to feel empowered, to help their 
community or to give law 
enforcement officials eyes where they seem to have none. 
Whatever the reason, the 
movement is spreading. 
A website, aptly titled 
“The Real Life Superhero Project,” documents the 
personas of wannabe crime-
fighters and provides a ref-erence manual for fledgling crusaders.
Sure, some will probably 
get hurt and maybe even killed in a scuffle when they could have called 911, but all of us have a little 
hero inside.

Haiti recovery takes 
more than cash
A year later, some progress has been made. There’s still a long way to go, however, in rebuilding the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.
On the anniversary of the earthquake in Haiti, the me-
dia are refocusing its collective lenses on the victims of the disaster. Last January’s earthquake was answered with $2 billion in donations from the United States, one of the 
largest international aid efforts ever conducted through 
private organizations.
A year later, international aid organizations are asking 
one another where all the money went. The Red Cross still has $250 million in the bank — about half of what it raised 
— and some are wondering why, in the face of a cholera 
outbreak and the tents dotting the outskirts of Port-au-Prince, it hasn’t made a major withdrawal.
While it’s far from us to judge how the Red Cross dis-
tributes the donations (so long as the needy get the li-on’s share), we understand why the organization hasn’t pumped all $500 million into Haiti all at once. This isn’t a problem solved by throwing mounds of money at people. Rebuilding takes not only cash, but time and effort. So 
long as a charity isn’t stealing donations or funneling the 
majority of its funds into “administrative costs,” other or -
ganizations’ critiques only slow the recovery process. 
A year later, Haiti needs long-term recovery.
Academia’s future not printed on paper
I just dropped the book-bill bomb on my parents.  Needless to say, warnings of “you better actually read these” followed.  Of course I will, Mom and Dad … 
maybe.
The whirlwind of textbook purchasing at the begin-
ning of every semester has transformed into an art form. Throughout this painful process, most students go to mul-
tiple stores, snagging a few from Chegg, maybe just pass-
ing on books altogether because a professor dropped the blessed, “All PowerPoints will be posted online.” Well, I have a prediction that may sound far-fetched at first, but here it goes: By the time our children are in college, text-
books will be obsolete. We won’t use them.
Yes, I understand this may sound stupid at first. How 
can one have school without textbooks, right? To many, 
the two go hand in hand. However, many will tell you 
that most of their classes don’t use them and that more 
material is Web- or CD-focused.
I speak from personal experience. Last semester, due 
to various reasons, I did not have to buy a single text-book.  Due to free online texts, a professor slipping, “All 
test questions are from the PowerPoints” and the advice 
of TAs, I slunk through without a single one. This made me think: How quickly are we moving away from buying books and toward purchasing access codes?  
The power and efficiency of the Internet is obvious. 
Communication and information can be transmitted in a nanosecond, and the whole world is literally at your fin-gertips. Almost everybody is computer literate, and ev-ery generation has greater ease in using new technology. 
Most of the world’s information is housed online, and it’s 
constantly updated with new developments, discoveries and opinions. It goes uncontested as the most efficient, user-friendly and influential 
source of information in exis-
tence. So why, with such prevail-ing dominance, do universities 
still use textbooks that are, especially with the speed at which technology moves, so outdated?
If we are to learn at the caliber necessary to compete in 
today’s workforce, we’ll need to stay current on academia, and textbooks aren’t an efficient way to do so. By the time a book is written, edited, published and finally sold, it is 
most likely out of date. As much as the old schoolers like 
to keep things traditional, it is becoming more obvious how superior Internet-based learning is to books. Classes are slowly transforming to become more e-based and em-brace the proficiency, not to mention the millions of pieces 
of paper it saves our ever-consuming world. 
I’ll close with a plug for my dear old Dad, a math pro-
fessor back in Georgia. Always Mr. Traditional, he was 
probably one of the few happy to see me purchasing 
books this semester. In his eyes and the eyes of people like 
him, reading textbooks and studying is the “proper” way to learn. Well, Dad, I hope this article isn’t too frustrating, but it’s this mindset that could keep academia from pro-gressing. Yes, textbooks are filled with tons of correct and 
useful knowledge, but in an increasingly technological 
and constantly changing world, there is no way they can compete with the benefits of online-based information. 
Are textbooks on the way out? Nobody can be sure, 
but I would like to think that they are. Maybe my children will have online textbooks, and maybe they won’t, but for the sake of my checkbook and their future, I sure hope they do.

Speaking OutWEDNESDAY, JANUARY 12, 2011 n  ALLIGATOR, 7
Vitriol. It’s a word that’s been used all too often in 
the wake of the tragic shooting of 20 individuals in Tuscon, Ariz. Much of the coverage around Dem-
ocratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who suffered a nonfatal gunshot to the head, sadly but unsurprisingly revolved 
around politicking instead of psychology.
Vitriol may be the defining word of political dialogue 
in this country , but mental health ought to be the subject of 
the media frenzy surrounding the shooting.
According to most reports that have come out so far, 
although the alleged shooter, Jared Loughner, did cite both “The Communist Manifesto” and “Mein Kampf” as inspiring, and clearly distrusted the government, he was not motivated by politics. According to experts, he most 
likely suffers from a mental illness similar to schizophre-
nia, just as the Virginia Tech shooter did.
It has yet to be determined whether Loughner ever un-
derwent any psychiatric evaluation. However, the com-munity college which he attended suspended him for dis-turbing behavior in class and required him to undertake an evaluation in order to re-enroll in classes.
According to The Washington Post, Loughner’s ac-
tions in community college prompted one of his class-
mates to say that he was a mentally deranged person who 
was likely to bring an assault rifle to school and end up on the nightly news.
At one point in class, Loughner suggested strapping a 
bomb to a fetus.
Despite these warnings, Loughner was able to easily 
purchase a gun after passing a simple background check he clearly should not have passed. States must do a better job at reporting mental health issues to the federal data-
base of debilitating mental health conditions in order to 
avoid such bureaucratic loopholes.
Mental health appears to be the crux of this tragedy , 
but politicians are apt at bending headlines to their politi-cal will. Both sides have blamed the other’s policies for the tragedy.
As both parties jockey to take the moral high ground, a 
town is in mourning. Beset by hundreds of reporters that are surely in Tuscon as you read this, those who knew the 
shooter will have their grieving interrupted by swarming 
requests for interviews and appearances on “Good Morn-ing America.”
Politicians and journalists will slowly but surely move 
on to the next tragedy, the next compelling piece of reality to dramatize. In contrast, those impacted by the tragedy will be left to wonder if anything will be done to address the cause of the shooting.
Republicans would say that 
more people should be carrying guns, and that large numbers of 
gun-toting Americans would easily deter the most deter -
mined assassins.
Democrats would say this latest tragedy is further proof 
that tighter gun control laws are needed in each state.
Dems haven’t let a chance to rub Sarah Palin’s face in 
the mud pass them by either. Palin’s now-infamous map of America, with 20 crosshairs covering 20 Democratic congressmen who occupy seats in Republican districts will forever haunt her political future.
Republicans have been using NRA-friendly rhetoric 
for some time now. Though it may have caught up with them politically, and certainly isn’t conducive to a healthy debate, I don’t believe the rhetoric to be the cause of the shooting.
Both parties have and will continue to use the trag-
edy as a means to further their political agenda, all the while ignoring the fundamental issue at hand: that such a disturbed individual, exhibiting all the warning signs of a mass murderer, fell through the cracks of the school 
system. Gun control laws certainly played a role in this 
shooting as well.
Still, the focus shouldn’t be on gun control but rather 
parents’, teachers’ and the state’s ability to send someone to a mental health institutional involuntarily.
As the laws stand now, there does not appear to be any 
way that Loughner could have been forced to seek help because he did not have a violent past.
Even in California, which has very strict gun laws, 
a teacher could not have forced Loughner to seek treat-ment, and Loughner could have easily acquired a gun in a neighboring state or through illegal means.
I’m not trying to downplay the importance of gun 
control. I admit that I believe stricter gun control laws can reduce the number of homicides in this country. But it’s equally true that if someone is motivated enough, they will find a way to kill.
The media will continue to fall back on mentions of 
Sarah Palin to buoy their ratings. Democrats will continue to use the tragedy as a vehicle for tighter gun control laws and Republicans will continue to insist that guns don’t kill people. But until this country shifts its focus to the root cause of the tragedy, we’ll never be truly safe.

UWireIt’s hard to believe Ted Williams used to beg on the Hud-
son Street exit of Interstate 71, just seconds down the street from my apartment. Thousands of people drove 
past him every day , disregarding the man with the sign. Now, after a short video posted by the The Columbus Dis-
patch, Williams will never feel ignored again.
Williams’ example just goes to show how quickly social 
media can spread something around the world. In a mat-
ter of seconds, Williams went from standing jobless on the curb to receiving employment offers from Kraft Macaroni & Cheese and the Cleveland Cavaliers. If you would have asked about Williams just eight days ago, everyone would have thought you were talking about the Red Sox baseball great. Now, Williams’ name means something different.
The Dispatch reported the video got more than 12 mil-
lion views on YouTube before YouTube acknowledged the 
media outlet’s copyright com-plaint and removed the video. It’s wrong for other people to steal a website’s content, but at the same time, would the video 
have received as much attention if not for YouTube?
For some reason, it seems as if many people don’t consid-
er this stealing. And it just doesn’t happen with news videos — music artists continually have their music and music vid-eos put online without their permission. Internet users have come to believe online content should just be free.
Though I don’t believe stealing videos and putting them 
up on YouTube is right, it did help spread Williams’ story . From now on, I imagine The Dispatch will put all of its vid-eos on a YouTube channel as well as its website. At the very least they will watermark all of their videos, putting a logo 
on the video.
In a statement made by The Dispatch explaining the re-
moval of the video, it was said that the YouTube video was 
posted “in violation of The Dispatch Printing Co.’s copy-right.” The Dispatch probably pulled the video off of You-Tube because people were viewing its content there, which doesn’t earn The Dispatch money . 
A lot of people are attacking The Dispatch’s decision, 
calling it behind the times. But the newspaper is dealing 
with a new problem presented by social media.

UWireTHE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MOSCOW — Russian police 
on Tuesday arrested dozens of 
people suspected of planning 
a racist rally near the Kremlin 
walls, as authorities looked to avert a repeat of last month’s riots by ultra-nationalists who 
objected to the presence of non-
Slavs in the country.
The arrests came after jittery 
police cordoned off part of a pub-lic square outside the Kremlin 
and evacuated a nearby shopping 
mall.
At least 30 police trucks lined 
up on Manezh Square in response 
to Internet threats by ultra-na-
tionalists to repeat the Dec. 11 ri-ots, in which 5,000 people chant-ed “Russia for Russians” and beat dark-skinned passers-by. 
The riots were a reaction to the 
killing of a white Russian soccer fan during a fight with people from the south of the country. 
The violence left more than 
30 people wounded and raised doubts about the government’s ability to stem a rising tide of xe-nophobia. 
Days later, police detained 800 
people in the capital and other cities to prevent any further vio-lence.An Associated Press television 
crew saw at least 20 people taken to police vans Tuesday after a po-
lice document check, including 
one person wearing clothes bear -
ing the initials of a well-known nationalist organization, the Movement Against Illegal Immi-gration. 
Russian news agencies said up 
to 100 people were detained.
Kremlin critics accuse the au-thorities of fomenting social dis-order to justify a crackdown on the opposition before presiden-
tial elections in 2012. Since the 
unrest, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has proposed restricting the movement of nonresidents into big cities and President Dmitry Medvedev has called for 
mandatory prison sentences for 
people participating in unauthor -
ized rallies. 
Moscow’s police chief Vladi-
mir Kolokoltsev has said liberal 
values come a distant second to 
public order.
Critics, including former Dep-
uty Prime Minister Boris Nemts-
ov, have said the measures pro-
posed by Putin and Medvedev could cripple attempts to hold peaceful anti-government dem-onstrations.
Putin and Medvedev have said 
one of them will run for president in 2012, but they won’t compete. It continues to appear that Pu-
tin, thought to retain real control 
over Russia since his eight-year stint as president ended in 2008, will run again.
While ethnic Russians make 
up four-fifths of Russia’s popu-lation of 142 million, the country is also home to about 180 ethnic groups. 
The Caucasus region, with its 
mountainous terrain and isolated valleys, hosts at least 100 eth-nicities including Chechens, who have waged two separatist wars 
since the 1991 collapse of the So-
viet Union.8, ALLIGATOR n WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 12, 2011

KNOXVILLE, Tenn.— After a 
year and a half of criticism, strug-
gle and doubt, Kenny Boynton 
looked like he was on his way to yet another poor outside shooting night. 
But the sophomore refused 
to be rattled and would not quit shooting, bouncing back from a 1-of-5 start from beyond the arc to hit both of his three-point attempts 
in overtime, propelling Florida (13-
3, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) to a 81-75 win over Tennessee (10-6, 0-2 SEC) on Tuesday night in 
Knoxville.  
“I just put everything that hap-
pened earlier in the game behind 
me,” Boynton said.
Boynton finished the game with 
17 points, including the first three of overtime. With 45 seconds re-maining, he drained another bas-ket, stretching UF’s lead to a near-
insurmountable seven. 
“I knew it was cash,” senior 
Chandler Parsons said. “He has ice in his veins.”
The win was Florida’s first in 
its last five tries in Knoxville, al-
lowing seniors Parsons, Alex Tyus and Vernon Macklin to avoid end-
ing their careers without a win in 
Thompson-Boling Arena. 
“That’s huge,” Parsons said. 
“I’d never won here. That was real 
important to me. It feels good to 
win here.”
The Gators got the best of what 
turned out to be an offensive shoo-tout. Each team connected on more 
than 47 percent of its shots for the 
game. 
Florida continued its recent 
trends of ball movement and strong 
three-point shooting, connecting 
on 8 of 16 attempts from beyond the arc. The Gators amassed 14 as-sists to just 11 turnovers in a hos-tile road environment. 
“We came in and knew they 
were going to play tough and physical and try to deny,” Parsons said. “Coach has been emphasiz-ing making good decisions with the ball in our hands and that’s what we wanted to do tonight.”
Parsons continued his recent 
hot streak, scoring 16 points on 4-of-5 three-point shooting. He also added six rebounds and two assists.
With the game tied and 42 sec-
onds remaining, Tennessee’s Cam-eron Tatum missed a midrange jumper and  Tyus was fouled while going for the rebound. 
After Tyus missed the front end 
of the one-and-one, Brian Williams missed his chance to give Tennes-see the win. 
Macklin grabbed the rebound,

Gators top Volunteers on road 
as Boynton hits two threes in OT
By ALLISON BANKO

The crowds may not rec-
ognize her just yet, but she’s 
proven she’s not going any-where. The Florida gymnas-tics team debuted freshman 
Alaina Johnson at last week’s 
meet against Nebraska, and she made history. 
Johnson broke out as an 
all-around competitor for the No. 1 Gators, hauling in an impressive 39.425 points, the second highest for an all-around debut in Florida his-
tory. Johnson fell just behind 
Samantha Lutz’s 39.45 open in the 2004 season. 
Despite her stellar perfor -
mance, Johnson is not one to sit back and bask in her suc-cesses. 
“I had my meeting with Alaina, and she did what peo-ple would consider phenom-enal for her first meet,” coach Rhonda Faehn said. “She was very focused, and she 
told me all the areas that she 
knew she needed to improve upon and what she needed to work on for the next week. 
S h e ’ s a very s m a r t gym-nast and 
k n o w s 
what she 
needs to do.”
Johnson scored a 9.85 
on vault, a 9.925 on uneven parallel bars, a 9.750 on bal-ance beam and a 9.9 on floor exercise. Johnson’s scores place her third in the nation 
among all-arounders, just  Johnson breaks 
out in first meet
Key plays free Tyus from goat 
reputation twice against Vols
 
Alex Tyus was thisclose to 
yet another heartbreak at Thompson-Boling Arena.
Tyus, who clanked a potential 
game winner with five seconds left at Tennessee last year, stood at the foul line with a wide-open shot at redemption: one-and-one free throws, game tied, 42 seconds left.
Tyus choked. Again. The senior forward clanked the 
front end, and all of a sudden the 
Volunteers were poised to steal an 
SEC win without suspended coach Bruce Pearl. But unlike last year, Tyus had a chance to escape his role as the Gators’ goat.
Maybe a Tennessee player or 
fan got in his head. Maybe he be-
came his own worst enemy, think-
ing back to last year’s failure. Maybe it was just the odds — a 75 percent free-throw shooter due for a miss. 
Whatever happened at the c h a r i t y stripe, Tyus did not stop to feel sorry 
for himself. 
Instead, he hustled back on defense and came up huge for the Gators, 
blocking the Vols’ potential game-
winning shot inside the paint.
Sure, Kenny Boynton stole the 
show in overtime, hitting a pair of 
clutch treys and knocking down two free throws as Florida held on 81-75. But Tyus was equally impor -
tant, extending Florida’s lead to six 
on a breakaway dunk and limiting 
Tennessee’s second leading scorer Tobias Harris to 0-for-2 shooting in the last five minutes.

Matt Tripp / Alligator Staff
Freshman Alaina Johnson recorded the second-highest all-around debut score in Flori -
da history Friday night, racking up 39.425 points in a meet against Nebraska.
and UF called a timeout with 5.8 
seconds remaining. 
That only left enough time 
for junior Erving Walker’s last-second heave, which missed by a comfortable margin to send the game to overtime. 
Florida continued its efforts 
to get Tyus involved in the of-fense early on, as he scored the 
team’s first seven points 
on his way 
to 18 for the game. 
“We al-
ways want 
to establish our bigs early,” Par -
sons said.
A first half of runs ended 
with Florida taking a one-point lead into the break. 
The Volunteers used a 6-0 
run to grab the advantage before UF responded with six straight points of its own to take a 15-14 edge. 
After UT bounced back with 
a 9-0 stretch, the Gators scored 11 consecutive points to grab the 
lead they would take into the 
break. 
After allowing the Volun-
teers to sink 11 field goals in the 
game’s first 14:14, the Gators 
yielded just a single field goal the rest of the half.
The Gators are now 1-1 in 
overtime games this season.Tyus scores

HOOPS , from page 14Texas native joins Dickerson as crucial all-arounder
behind sophomore all-arounder Ashanée 
Dickerson.
Johnson, with her southern accent and 
5-foot-1 frame, came to UF from Tyler, Texas — where she racked up gymnastic skills and accolades since she began the sport at age 5. 
The 2008 and 2010 Texas Gymnast of 
the Year trained at Texas East Gymnastics, 
where she made the U.S. Senior National 
Team from 2008 to 2010 and attended the U.S. Olympic Trials in 2008. Johnson said it was the warmth of UF’s program that drove her want to secure a spot on the roster.
“The reason why I picked Florida was I 
liked the coaches a lot, and I felt comfortable being around them and Rhonda especially,” she said. “I just felt like I had known her for 
a long time, even though it was the first time 
I had met her.”
Now, Johnson joins Dickerson as a key 
force for the all-around realm. Last year, Dickerson walked into the same position that Johnson is currently in, starting as a competitor in four events.
“My first meet, I felt a little bit of pressure 
because I didn’t know what to expect,” Dick-
erson said. “Now that I know what it’s like 
to compete in all four events in every meet, I can help Alaina out and tell her the differ -
ent cues.” 
However, Faehn said the two aren’t in 
heavy competition with one another, de-scribing them as “the most selfless and team-oriented athletes.” 
Johnson is already working on setting her 
sights on this Friday’s meet against No. 16 Kentucky and how she can polish her per -
formances. 
“There’s always different things that I 
can improve on,” she said. “And I need to be sure to not step back any.”GYM , from page 14
“I could see when he was 
walking back after the missed 
free throw that he was disap-pointed,” coach Billy Donovan said. “I was really impressed 
that he kept his head in the 
game.”
Tyus paced Florida with 18 
points and seven boards for the game. And perhaps just as sweet for Gators fans was the victim of his late-game block: Volunteers center Brian Williams, who has never shied away from the role of villain at the O’Dome, often jarring with Rowdy Reptiles in past years.
But, in the big picture, it 
doesn’t really matter that Tyus stopped Williams — or that he even led the team in scoring Tuesday night. Heck, the final score probably isn’t a huge deal. It’s one win in a season of 30-plus regular season games.
What does matter, however, is how much responsibility Donovan put on his big men to set the tone. Tyus started the game scoring Florida’s first seven points. And in the second half, Tyus and fellow big man 
Vernon Macklin combined for 
the team’s first eight.
Perhaps a greater indicator 
of Tyus’ stability was his ability to bounce back from a terrible performance Saturday against Ole Miss, when he recorded just two points and three rebounds in 27 minutes.
Coming into this game, he 
said he wasn’t even worried about bouncing back.
“I’m just coming out trying 
to play with an open mind, fig-
ure out where I need to get the 
ball at and just go from there,” Tyus said. “It’s going to come, I’m just going with the flow.”
And Florida needs that con-
fidence. Recede Wallace cut his dreads, but he kept some swag-ger.
TYLER , from page 14n UNDEFEATED TCU ENDS SEASON AS NO. 2.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
GLENDALE, Ariz. — From back of the pack to top of the 
heap, Auburn’s climb to its first national title in 53 years was 
unprecedented.
The Tigers finished No. 1 in The Associated Press Top 25 
following a 22-19 victory against Oregon in the BCS cham-pionship Monday night. Auburn won its only other AP title in 1957, and the Tigers started 2010 further back than any 
champion since the poll expanded to 25 teams in 1989.
“We’re the best football team in the United States of 
America,” Auburn coach Gene Chizik proclaimed after Wes 
Byrum’s 19-yard field goal as time expired gave the Tigers a thrilling win.
Auburn (14-0) began the season at No. 22. The previous 
lowest preseason ranking for a national champion in the Top 25 era was Oklahoma, which went from No. 19 to No. 1 in 
2000. The Tigers received 56 of 59 first-place votes Monday 
night. One voter did not submit a ballot.
TCU (13-0) had to settle for No. 2 after beating Wisconsin 
in the Rose Bowl. The Horned Frogs received the other three 
first-place votes and had their best finish in the AP poll since winning the 1938 national title.
Oregon finished third, a spot ahead of Pac-10 rival Stan-
ford. Ohio State was fifth.
Auburn’s title makes it five straight for the Southeastern 
Conference, joining Florida (with two), LSU and Alabama. 
The Tigers had three other SEC West rivals ranked ahead of 
them at the start of the season — preseason No. 1 Alabama, Arkansas and LSU — but nobody realized what a difference 
their new quarterback would make.
Cam Newton transferred in from junior 
college last spring, carried the Tigers to a 
national championship and won the Heis-man Trophy — and a slew of other awards 
— along the way.
“Throughout this whole season he’s 
been having this team on his back,” said 
freshman Michael Dyer, who ran for 143 
yards against Oregon and was the offen-
sive player of the game.
Horned Frogs fans probably wouldn’t mind one more 
game, though if any fans can relate to going unbeaten and 
not getting a shot at the national title, it’s Auburn rooters.
The last time the Tigers had a perfect season was 2004, 
but Southern California and Oklahoma played for the na-tional championship and Tommy Tuberville’s team finished No. 2. The Tigers’ faithful have never gotten over that, but 
this time around nothing could deny them.
The nation’s strongest conference finished with three 
teams in the top 10, five in the first 15 and six in the Top 25, 
more than any other league. LSU was eighth, Alabama was 
10th, Arkansas finished 12th, Mississippi State was 15th and South Carolina was No. 22.
The SEC finished 5-5 in the bowl season, but the West 
Division was 4-1. The only loss was Arkansas’ 31-26 setback to Ohio State in the Sugar Bowl.
WHIPPLE SET TO BECOME UCONN COACH: Former Miami offen-
sive coordinator Mark Whipple is in the final stages of negotia-tions to become Connecticut’s next head coach, according to a UConn athletic department official. The official said an an-
nouncement would not come before Thursday.
MIAMI HIRES RECEIVERS COACH: Cleveland Browns wide re-
ceivers coach George McDonald has been hired for the same job with the Miami Hurricanes.
McDonald coached the past two seasons for the Browns,

n THE UF WOMEN’S BASKETBALL TEAM IS 12-5 
BUT AVERAGES 19 TURNOVERS PER GAME.

Picked to finish last in the Southeastern Conference, the 
Gators are exceeding the expectations pundits placed on them 
before the season. But despite the early success, there is still 
some cause for concern.
After beating South Carolina 65-63 on Sunday, the Gators 
(12-5, 2-1 SEC) are sitting strong through three conference 
games. And quality wins over Charlotte, Old Dominion and Arkansas provide hope for Florida fans that a return to promi-nence is imminent. 
But losses at Brown, Hampton and Auburn, and lackluster 
efforts in wins against UNF and Navy , raise questions about the Gators’ ability to persevere through a strenuous SEC schedule. 
Ball control continues to be an issue for the inexperienced 
and up-tempo Gators. Entering the conference schedule, Flor -
ida averaged 16.8 turnovers per game.  Through three SEC games, UF is averaging 19 turnovers and has yet to force more than it allows. 
In wins against Arkansas and South Carolina, Florida com-
mitted 40 total turnovers and forced just 25. 
While giveaways can be a necessary evil of the fast-paced of-
fense Florida likes to use, the Gators’ ability to run an effective offense and compete in the SEC rests squarely on the continued growth of point guards Jaterra Bonds and Lanita Bartley.  
Both have shown promise, only to be coupled with costly 
mistakes in pivotal moments. 
Bonds, a freshman playing more minutes than any of the 
other five newcomers, has a team-high 47 turnovers on the sea-
son. And fellow newcomer Bartley is just behind with 37.
But Bartley’s last-second, game-winning steal and score 
against South Carolina is a perfect example of what the frenetic 
pace coach Amanda Butler desires can lead to.
“For the game-winning play to come on defense is some-thing we talk about all the time,” Butler said following the game. “We dwell on it. We practice making plays on defense to lead us offensively .” 
Averaging 67.1 points per game, the Gators do not have the 
offensive prowess to recover from mistakes and large deficits against high-scoring teams.  Florida has scored 80 points or more just twice this season (in routs of Harvard and Alabama State) and prefer a lockdown defense to a dynamic offense.
Keeping the game close and capitalizing on mistakes has 
been the team’s hallmark and will likely be the strategy when No. 5 Tennessee comes to Gainesville on Thursday.
Tennessee, outscoring opponents by 25-plus points on aver -
age, can put up 80 points with ease and boasts a positive turn-over margin of 4.2.
The Volunteers have shown they can be susceptible to mis-
takes of their own, committing 29 turnovers twice this season — in a 63-50 win against Louisville in the season opener and a 69-58 loss to Georgetown six games later.
Although protecting the ball is a necessity, don’t expect Flor -
ida to come out playing on its heels.
“How can we hold a balanced and offensively potent team 
down to the 50s and 60s?” Butler said. “It’s going to be a huge challenge. We’ve got to make it ugly.”Ball control among key issues young Gators can improve
“For the game-winning play to come on de -
fense is something we talk about all the time.”
