The undergraduate programs 
in the College of Education will 
not be eliminated next academic year under a draft of a 10 percent budget cut proposal presented Fri-day by Catherine Emihovich, dean of the college.
“The option of being graduate-
only is off the table,” she said.
Two graduate degrees will be phased out, however. The college will seek to reduce enrollment in its two undergraduate programs, elementary education and early childhood education, although that plan is separate from the bud-get proposal outlined Friday.UF asked the college last month, 
along with the College of Nursing, to present the pros and cons of cutting their undergraduate pro-grams, which generated protest from students and faculty.
About 600 of the education col-lege’s 1,800 students are under-graduates.

faculty, one of whom would even-tually be eligible for tenure, and

UF may continue offering Vietnamese 
classes next year after assistant professor 
Andrea Pham, who was scheduled to be 
laid off in June, was ordered to be reinstat-
ed by an arbitrator about a week ago.
The arbitrator ruled that UF violated 
its contract with the faculty union when it 
fired Pham, who teaches the only two Viet-
namese classes at UF, as a result of budget cuts.
Paul D’Anieri, dean of the College of 
Liberal Arts and Sciences, said no decision 
has been made on whether the Vietnamese 
classes taught by Pham will be available next year, but said it was likely.
“That’s what she was hired to do, so 
it makes a certain amount of sense to as-
sume that that is what she 
would be doing,” he said Friday. 
D’Anieri said he should 
know for sure some time 
this week whether the 
courses will continue to be offered.
He said he hasn’t de-
cided where the college, which released a 
draft version of a $9.3 million budget cut 
proposal Wednesday, will find the money to reinstate Pham. Pham’s salary, which

Early voter turnout for Gainesville City 
Elections is quadruple that of the 2007 Spring Elections, possibly because of stu-
dent interest in Charter Amendment 1, Su-
pervisor of Elections Pam Carpenter said.
About 2,200 people participated in early 
voting, which ran from Monday through 
Saturday, up from under 500 people in the 
last stand-alone city election in 2007, Car-penter said. 
The citywide election will take place on 
Tuesday and voters may cast ballots at their 
precinct polling places between 7 a.m. and 
7 p.m.
Her office received many calls during the 
week from students asking if voters had to vote on all ballot issues and candidates, or if they could just choose one, she said.
“You can vote for just one, or as many is-
sues or candidates as you want,” she said.
Carpenter believed invigoration from the 
presidential elections last fall may also have played a role in student participation.                         
“I would like to think that some of our 
younger voters came to realize how impor-tant it is to participate in democracy,” she said.UF ADMINISTRATION

GPD: Man arrested after spitting out bag of crack
A man was arrested for possession of a controlled sub-
stance after spitting out a small bag of crack cocaine while 
talking to Gainesville Police Department officers.
Thursday night, GPD police officers arrived at 1030 S.E. 
Sixth Ave., the GPD arrest report stated.
According to the report, when officers made eye contact 
with a man sitting in a chair, he  jumped up and ran around the corner of the house.
While following him, the officers saw him put something 
white into his mouth, the report stated.
According to the report, when the man stopped to talk to the officers, they found two crack pipes near his feet.
The officers suspected that the white item the man put in 
his mouth was crack, and they told him to spit it out, the re-
port stated.
After 20 minutes of talking, the man spit the bag out, the 
contents later testing positive for cocaine.
According to the report, Carl Durrah, 31, told police that he 
was about to put cocaine into a bag when he saw the officers.
Durrah was charged with possession of a controlled sub-
stance, possession and use of drug paraphernalia and resist-
ing an officer without violence.

Florida Sen. Nan Rich, a Demo-

While the act is sickening enough, she says re-search has shown that people who molest animals are likely to rape or molest people.District Attorney James Scott eventually charged the man with two counts of criminal mischief, which was later changed to a 
theft charge.
Shocked by that and other 
similar cases of involving hu-
mans having sex with animals, lawmakers in Florida and Alas-ka are considering bans on bes-tiality. They are among 15 states where the practice is not explic-itly illegal.
Alaska’s House Judiciary

JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — It’s 
a subject that can cause nervous 
snickering, a little uneasiness and even a few bad jokes.
But many in the southeast Alas-
ka community of Klawock, popu-lation 800, weren’t laughing last April after a 26-year-old registered sex offender was accused of mo-lesting a local family’s pet dog.
The man was spotted coaxing 
the Labrador retriever into the woods near a ball field. There he allegedly tied it to a tree, taped its 
muzzle shut with duct tape and 
had sex with it, witnesses told po-lice at the time.
The man had been twice con-
victed of raping a young boy and more recently served probation for assault after lunging at a child. While the incident with the dog was reported to the police, Kla-
wock Mayor Don Marvin said 
nothing happened for two days while fearful parents escorted their children home from school.

A tug-of-war ensued on Friday among a 
group of six members from Students for a 
Democratic Society, who pulled to protest 
the current budget cuts UF is facing as well 
as costs of funding the Iraq war.
After holding the first demonstration in 
the Plaza of the Americas, the role-playing students visited other areas of campus like Turlington Plaza and the Reitz Union Food Court.  The role-playing students tugged back and forth, fighting for a paper bag with a dollar sign drawn on it placed in the mid-dle of the rope. 
Students and workers, tugged against 
politicians, corporations and the military-
industrial complex. An announcer stood by 
to inform students about current cuts and encourage them to get involved.
“People need to understand what’s hap-
pening in context with these national is-sues,” said UF senior Skeet Surrency, who organized the protest. “If we want to save education, we need to stop spending money on things that aren’t helping people and kill-
ing others.”According to Surrency, the war is costing 
$6 million on paper, although in reality the 
government is spending over a trillion dol-lars a year. 
He said he thought the money could be 
better spent on Social Security and educa-tion. The tug-of-war stressed a message of pulling funding from the war to give to edu-cation.
“We want to engage the student body 
and fight this together,” said UF political sci-ence senior and SDS member Tina Steiger. 
UF freshman Kathleen Carroll said it was 
difficult to hear announcements made by the group during the plaza’s tug-of-war because of the nearby chanting of Hare Krishna mu-sicians. Still, Carroll said she appreciated the act.
“Their message is important, whether 
you agree with it or not, but they need to be able to present it well in order for it to have 
an impact,” she said.STUDENT LIFEGroup holds tug-of-war to protest war, budget cuts

UF students who are deployed 
overseas are getting a taste of 
home thanks to their fellow Gators. 
Operation Gator Gratitude 
is a donation drive to send care packages to UF students current-
ly serving in Iraq and Afghani-
stan. The drive, which runs until March 27, is a project of Gator Community Outreach, Collegiate Veterans Society and Omega Del-ta Sigma, a veterans fraternity. The group is collecting hygiene 
products, non-perishable food 
and snacks, socks and other items.
“Anything they 
get, they’re grate-ful for,” said Kelly 
Packard, coordinator of the drive and member of Gator Commu-nity Outreach and the Collegiate Veterans Society. 
Packard said this drive is a 
way for students to have a direct impact on classmates who are 
serving in the military overseas. 
Those affected include active duty, inactive duty and individu-als ready reserve. 
Andrew Martinez, a Marine 
who has been deployed multiple times, knows how it feels to re-ceive items from the home front.
He said random acts of kind-
ness, such as care packages, are 
definitely a morale booster.
 “It’s always nice to get any 
kind of mail,” Martinez said.

Toting signs that said “Vote no 
on 1” and “Equality for all,” about 55 
Gainesville residents marched Fri-day near the intersection of North-west Eighth Avenue and Northwest 
34th Street.  
The protesters opposed Charter 
Amendment 1, which would remove 
Gainesville’s existing discrimination protections based on sexual orienta-
tion and gender identity, said Shelbi 
Day, a marcher and the director of communications and media for Equality is Gainesville’s Business,   which opposes the amendment.
The march, which went along 
Northwest Eighth Avenue for about 15 minutes followed by a sign-hold-ing demonstration at the intersec-
tion, included Gainesville parents, 
children, church members, faculty and students.
Day said the march aimed to let 
locals know that Gainesville says “no” to discrimination.
On the other hand, Micanopy res-
ident Troy Blakely, who held a sign in favor of the amendment near the Supervisor of Elections Office dur-
ing early voting on Saturday, said the amendment should be passed 
because it represents a public safety 
issue and would protect against sex-ual predators.
Art Ellingsen, a Gainesville 
resident and a member of the pro-
amendment group Citizens for Good Public Policy, referenced the group’s commercial depicting a man entering a women’s restroom.
He said he worries about the 
safety of his baby granddaughter when she visits him if the amend-
ment does not pass.
Tamara Cohen, the director of 
multicultural and diversity affairs at 
UF and a member of the march, said she cares about issues of sexual vio-lence and that is not what her fight against the amendment is about.
“It’s about protecting Gainesville 
as an inclusive, welcoming city,” she 
said. 
Zoe Falcone, a transgender UF 
botany senior and a march par-
ticipant, planned to go to graduate school at UF but will leave if the amendment is passed.
“It would be just bad for our rep-
utation and bad for our city and bad for the university,” Falcone said.
After spending about 30 minutes 
at the Northwest Eighth Avenue and Northwest 34th Street intersection, about 15 demonstrators drove to the corner of Northwest 13th Street and Northwest 16th Avenue to continue holding their signs and listening for the occasional horn honks from passing cars.

One of only 97 living Medal of 
Honor recipients was honored Sat-urday for saving the lives of fellow Marines by covering a grenade with his body during the Korean War.
More than half a century after be-
ing awarded the Medal of Honor by former President Dwight Eisenhow-er in 1952, Duane Dewey, 77, was honored at Gainesville’s American Legion Post 16 Saturday.
More than 100 Veterans, UF 
ROTC members and people wear-ing patriotic hats and T-shirts at-
tended the event.
Since 1862, the United States has 
given 3,467 Medals of Honor, ac-
cording the the Congressional Med-al of Honor Society Web site. Dewey is one of only 328 Medal of Honor recipients since Pearl Harbor who lived to receive his medal.
Dewey, who lives in Hawthorne, 
Fla., said that a bullet to the stomach 
and gaping wounds to his hip made 
him fear for his life.
Dewey’s speech lasted less than 
five minutes, and rather than talking about himself, he spent most of his time at the microphone individually thanking 22 people, including his wife, Bertha.
“I really don’t deserve all this,” 
he said. “I’m just another veteran. A lucky veteran.” 
Michelle Dubreuil, a junior in 
UF’s Army ROTC program, said that she felt honored to watch the ceremony.
Dubreuil said that because today 
the military is often looked at nega-tively, it was refreshing to see some-one honored for such a selfless act.
“It’s great to get the point of view 
of someone who’s been there,” she 
said.
Dewey considers it an honor 
when men and women in the mili-
tary look up to him.
“It was especially nice to see the 
young ones sitting out there listen-ing,” he said.
Dewey was honored by Post 16 
twice before as part of a yearly tra-dition began in 2007 after the U.S. Congress named March 25 National Medal of Honor Day.
Despite the two previous cer-
emonies and more than five decades of recognition from veterans around the country, Dewey said that the 
support never gets old.
“It’s humbling,” he said, “all 
those people here for me.”Ceremony held for local veteran, Medal of Honor recipient 4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, MARCH 23, 2009

A Gainesville man was arrested and 
charged with grand theft auto after being ac-
cused of driving a stolen car early Saturday.Gainesville Police Officer Shawn Barnes 
saw three men acting suspiciously in a park-ing lot near the 1000 block of Southeast Fourth Avenue at 1:20 a.m. Saturday, GPD spokesman Keith Kameg said.
Before the men drove off, Barnes did a re-
cords check on the license plate of the white Kia, the report stated.
According to the GPD arrest report, re-
cords indicated that the car was reported stolen on Wednesday.
After pulling the car over, the driver, 
Ruben Williams, 41, told Barnes his driver’s license was not valid, the report stated. Ac-cording to the report, Williams had two sus-pensions on his driver’s license for not pay-ing child support. 
Williams told Barnes he didn’t know the 
car he was driving was stolen, and he had traded drugs to an unknown person to bor-row the car, the report stated.LOCAL

Music blared from a van’s speak-
ers, children bounced in an inflat-
able moonwalk and smoke poured 
from a huge grill cooking hot dogs 
and hamburgers at what seemed to be a typical block party.
But at Saturday’s block party in 
North East Park, Gainesville resi-dents who met low-income qualifi-cations applied for down payment assistance, mortgage foreclosure in-tervention, housing rehabilitation, 
housing reconstruction, credit re-
pair and community development block grants.
More than 200 people visited the 
park for the Gainesville Housing and Community Development Di-vision’s biannual event.
Assistant city manager Fred 
Murry, said the goal of the event was to let people know that it is possible to purchase or maintain a home despite financial problems.
“We want them to know all the 
ways the city can help them,” Mur-
ry said. “That’s what it’s all about.”
After getting food and sodas, 
visitors stopped at shaded tables to 
fill out applications while their chil-
dren played in the bounce house 
and took rides around the park on a trolley.
According to Housing and Com-
munity Development Division su-
pervisor Teresa Osoba, HCDD re-
ceives about as many applications at each block party as it does in an average month.
On Saturday, the group handed applications out to more than 100 people.
“We use the party to bring our 
office to the community,” she said. “People may be working Monday through Friday and can’t make it during office hours.”
Osoba said that people were 
lined up at 9 a.m., an hour before the event started, waiting to fill out applications and get informa-
tion about the city’s assistance pro-
grams. 
Gainesville resident Suzette Rig-gins said the event was helpful for her and her family because it was 
held on the weekend and so close 
to home.
Riggins, who applied for hous-
ing rehabilitation to fix her leaky roof, said that the atmosphere of 
the party was inviting and open, 
which made it easy to focus less on her money problems and just enjoy herself.
“Everyone was so friendly,” she 
said. “They gave me a lot of infor-mation and really helped me out.”

Environmentalism and public transportation are at 
the top of the platform for Gainesville City Commis-
sion candidate Tom Cunilio.         
 The At-Large Seat 1 candidate said he looks for-
ward to the March 24 election, after which he hopes to  
start implementing his platform. 
If elected, Cunilio said he will resign from his job 
at the Florida Renewable Research Conservation and 
Development Council because he said the City Com-
mission position is a full-time com-mitment.
He added that one of his oppo-
nents, incumbent Jeanna Mastrodi-
casa, is the assistant vice president 
for student affairs at UF.   
Cunilio earned a bachelor’s de-
gree from UF in agriculture in 1979 and a master’s in Spanish in 1988.                      
 “I stayed in Gainesville even af-
ter I graduated. I still have a lot to learn,” Cunilio said. 
“People were still teaching me.”                               
 Cunilio credits his three mentors, all of whom are 
retired UF faculty, for his continued education and ac-
tivism in the community.
To alleviate traffic congestion and help Gainesville 
become more environmentally friendly, Cunilio wants 
to propose that UF freshmen be prohibited from park-
ing cars on campus and that sophomores be required 
to enter a parking lottery.                                                          
 He would like to propose a privatization of the 
bus system and an increase in the number of city bus routes.
Using his background in the environment and agri-
culture, Cunilio said he can help create jobs and stimu-
late the Gainesville economy.
When it comes to the controversial Charter Amend-
ment 1, Cunilio said he is in favor of its passage.
“It’s a bogus issue,” he said. “Conservatives don’t 
want to come to Gainesville because of all of the liberal sexual politics.”Transportation,

Next month, the state 
of Michigan will join the ranks of 12 other 
states who currently allow for the use of medicinal marijuana 
– the first located between the 
Rockies and the East Coast.
Puff, puff, pass.With 13 states (and more 
exploring the issue) now ac-cepting pot use as a legal form of medication, the Editorial Board can’t help but wonder how long before medicinal 
marijuana becomes accepted 
nationwide. Sure, the debate gets raised all the time, but maybe America has finally reached a point in its history where medicinal marijuana may solve more problems than pundits say such legis-lation would cause. Unfortu-
nately, what will keep medici-
nal marijuana from becoming legal in all 50 states lies in the stereotypes perpetuated in popular culture that touch upon a small portion of users.Yes, there will always be 
“stoners,” such as the ones depicted in movies like “Har-old and Kumar” and “Half Baked,” but what about the 
50-year-old man who suf-
fers from glaucoma or the woman battling with chronic neck pain? Sadly, in states in which medicinal marijuana is not currently legal, other-wise law-abiding citizens are forced to turn to the streets to score weed – unnecessar-
ily feeding the machine that 
is the American drug trade. If they are unable to find pot, then “legal” alternatives such as prescription painkillers en-ter the picture, which can lead to abuse of the drug through addiction and overuse.
While any major shock to 
the status quo will come with its initial problems, the march to legalize medicinal mari-juana across the board seems more of a reality than ever before.Continuing his trend of engaging in everyman endeav-
ors, President Barack Obama’s actions Thursday eve-ning rang true with innumerable people across the 
country — wishing he could take back the words he already said.
During his interview on “The Tonight Show with Jay 
Leno,” Obama likened his latest bowling efforts to a perfor-mance one would see at the Special Olympics. 
And with one careless sentence, Obama showed the world 
that he, too, is far from perfect.
What makes Obama’s careless choice of words so disap-
pointing is the very group of people in question whose feel-ings he undoubtedly hurt.
Individuals with developmental disabilities work harder 
than anyone else in the world to have a chance at what so-ciety deems as a normal life. The Special Olympics, specifi-cally, provides a forum for athletes to compete against their peers at a high level and let them feel accomplished for their undying persistence. Yet, with the casual slip of the tongue by a hero for many Special Olympics athletes, they were rel-egated to nothing more than a stereotype that belies reality.
Yes, Obama realized that he made a mistake — even 
apologizing for his gaff before the interview hit the airwaves. There is no reason not to accept his sincere regret for his ac-tions, as Obama is simply a man who from time to time is bound to make errors in judgment. If there is any good to come out of this rather innocent miscue, the Editorial Board hopes Americans can become more conscious of their word choice and have a deeper appreciation for everyone with de-velopmental disabilities.
Ever since the end of the Cold War, political and 
historical experts alike have predicted a decline in American hegemonic status. Some of the nuttier ex-
perts, such as Russian scholar Igor Panarin, have even pre-dicted a complete collapse of our union into four differ-ent republics. Longhorn fans will be pleased to know that Panarin predicts the Republic of Texas will be the biggest 
of the four new countries, incorporating even Florida.
Today, talks of American decline have all but dissipat-
ed as international leaders have begun worrying over the 
prospects of American protectionism. Now, few wonder when America’s dominance will peter out, but whether 
Uncle Sam is still strong enough to protect the global fi-
nancial community. The world doesn’t have a choice but to accept the premise that American leadership is the only way out of this global economic fiasco. 
We’ve already broken out our “We’re No. 1!” foam fin-
gers, but that’s not enough. 
Take for instance last week’s distraction caused by the 
revelation that bonuses were paid out to AIG execs after taxpayers had bailed out the insurance/bank conglomer-
ate.
The total sum of the bonuses, $165 million, was a pal-
try amount compared to the $170 billion AIG has received 
and the total amount of money the government has put on 
the table to spend our way out of the impending economic 
Armageddon. The House of Representatives went into a flurry of populist rage, passing a bill in record time, taxing 90 percent of the AIG bonuses, providing Webster’s dic-tionary with the best example of grandstanding to date.
Meanwhile, Rome burned.This is not a time for petty discourse or blame games. 
Our problems affect every citizen of the world. Iceland’s government has already toppled over economic turmoil connected to our current financial woes. Just 
this Saturday, Hungary’s Prime 
Minister resigned over the eco-nomic mayhem in his own coun-try. The new weapon of mass 
destruction is global instability 
caused by economic strife. The 
world demands action and leadership from the United States, and we’re bickering over bonuses paid out to Wall Street executives! Were the bonuses morally reprehensi-
ble? Of course. Should we be outraged? Yes! But outrage 
doesn’t solve anything. It’s time to get over it and move on to more pressing problems.
The young Obama administration has let the economic 
crisis get away from them. President Barack Obama prom-ised to turn our crises into opportunities but has allowed Congress to turn into a collective rabid populist, looking for someone to blame our and the world’s woes on ever since former President George W. Bush disappeared to his 
ranch in Texas.
As college students at one of the nation’s leading re-
search institutions, we’re perfectly situated to turn crisis 
into opportunities, to take the lead in solving the world’s 
problems, to not only cry fire in a crowded theatre, but 
grab for the water hose, too. It’s time to switch the nation-al dialogue from populist outrage to constructive discus-sion and action, to forever prove wrong the windbags like Panarin.
After all, I’d much rather be a Gator than a Longhorn.Matthew Christ is a political science freshman. His column

Article reveals bigotry
Richard Selwach reveals the 
real agenda of the “Yes on Charter 
Amendment 1” campaign in Hunt-
er Sizemore’s March 20 article. 
While they claim to be “protect-
ing” women and children, he ad-
mits that his bigotry toward trans-
gender people drives him.  
Charter Amendment 1 is about 
discrimination, plain and simple. 
That is why groups like the 
League of Women Voters and the Gainesville Area Chamber of 
Commerce have come out against Charter Amendment 1. 
Selwach indicts the whole “Yes 
on 1” campaign with his hateful and clearly misinformed com-ments. 
If you believe that discrimina-
tion is wrong, vote NO on Charter 
Amendment 1 on March 24. 
Ryan Vandeventer
4 AGLetter to the Editor
I received a bit of a gift in one of my classes 
last week, and I’ve been thanking the gods of absurdity ever since. On Mon-
day, I had the pleasure of watching a debate on the proposed Charter Amendment 1. It 
was a slaughter and roused my latent politi-
cal conscience. 
Charter Amendment 1, for those who 
don’t know, is a proposal which will remove Gainesville’s abilities to pass its own dis-crimination categories — instead only those which are part of the Florida Civil Rights Act will apply. Unfortunately, while the Florida Civil Rights Act covers race, color, creed, re-
ligion, gender, national origin, age, handicap 
and marital and familial status, it conspicu-ously does not cover sexual orientation or gender identity. So, if Amendment 1 passes, discrimination protections will be removed from individuals falling into either of those two categories. And here I thought we were living in 2009, not 1959.
Essentially, the pro-amendment side 
makes two arguments in its defense, which I would like to present to you now. 
The first point was that — in theory — the 
City of Gainesville could now make business-es build unisex bathrooms. This would con-ceivably cost these businesses money and, really, is there any-thing more impor-tant than that?  Cer-tainly not ensuring the equal protection 
of all our citizens. 
Except the appro-priate representa-tives have already come forward and 
said that they were unable to find any busi-ness within Gainesville which they would force to do this. I guess the mere thought of them having this power is too much for the 
far right to stand. Oh, the Chamber of Com-
merce (which is anything besides a liberal consortium) has come out in opposition to Amendment 1. Now, unless President Ba-rack Obama’s creeping socialism has already had time to infiltrate the Gainesville Cham-ber of Commerce, I’m inclined to trust their judgment that the two extra categories of discrimination protection are not, as I keep 
hearing, “bad for business.”
The second point, however, was my fa-
vorite. Apparently, what I and all those who 
are opposed to discrimination and Amend-ment 1 fail to realize is this: Adding sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of protected groups will — in point of fact — increase discrimination! How could we be this blind? See, here’s the thing — and I’m paraphrasing a high-ranking member of a group which is supporting the amendment 
— if you add these categories, then why not 
add pregnant women and veterans? Then, the more groups you add, the more you leave off! 
The bottom line is that a vote for Amend-
ment 1 is — whether intentionally or not — a vote for discrimination. Even if LGBT pro-tections were bad for business (they aren’t) doesn’t there come a time when a choice has 
to be made? I’m reminded of a quotation by 
the Clarence Darrow character in “Inherit the Wind”: “A wicked law, like cholera, de-stroys everyone it touches — its upholders as well as its defiers.”
I urge all of you to get out there and vote 
no on Amendment 1. You can vote either today or tomorrow at the Alachua Country Administration Building, 12 S.E. First St. 
There is no excuse for not making your voice 
heard on this issue.
This is Gainesville. This is our town. Let’s 
make sure it belongs to all of us.

WAITING IN LINE TO BUY THE MOVIE.
Forty-five minutes before going on sale, “Twi-

Newberry Road. 
By 10 p.m. Friday, about 70 fans were waiting 
anxiously in line to get their hands on a copy of the movie, which tells the story of a teenage girl who falls in love with a vampire. 
Elizabeth Sam, who arrived at 3 p.m., was the 
first person in line. 
“I called yesterday, and they said come early, so 
I did,” said Sam, a student at Santa Fe College.At 10 p.m., Borders staff began to distribute lav-
ender tickets, which guaranteed customers copies 
of the DVD. Tickets for special edition DVDs were 
sold out by 10:03 p.m., and regular DVDs were sold 
out by 11:15 p.m.
Several activities were planned to 
occupy everyone until midnight, in-cluding “Twilight” trivia, a scavenger hunt and a raffle. 
After spending six hours in Borders, Sam said 
she would do it all over again. 
“I’m looking forward to waiting in a lot more

Locals rush to buy Twilight DVD
By CAROLYN TILLO
Alligator Contributing Writer 
Five members of UF’s award-
winning Dance Marathon team 
traveled to Orlando last week 
to film a commercial and attend the Children’s Miracle Network 
Celebration, an event honoring 
about 70 children from around the world for their positive at-titudes in the face of medical struggles.
Representatives for UF’s 
event were sent after receiving a summer award recognizing the school’s fundraising efforts and overall program, which typically draws more than 600 dancers, ac-cording to Madison Cheatwood, public relations chairwoman of Dance Marathon at UF. 
The Orlando celebration, 
which also highlighted national efforts made by Children’s Mira-cle Network last year, comes just before UF’s event, which will be held April 4 and 5. 
UF’s Dance Marathon, which 
has raised more than $2.8 million since starting in 1995, is an event 
where participants stay on their 
feet for 26.2 hours to raise money 
for the Children’s Miracle Net-
work at Shands Children’s Hos-pital at UF. 
While at the celebration, two 
team members filmed a national commercial that will air during the cause’s telethon this summer.
After being styled for the set 
on Thursday, Justine Cubbage and Kristine Putrino appeared with Olympic gold-medalist Mary Lou Retton  and delivered a plug about UF’s Dance Mara-thon. 
Cubbage, overall chairwoman 
for UF’s Dance Marathon, said UF’s team members received au-tograph books with the story of each child who attended the cel-ebration and went around asking the children for autographs.
Cubbage said she was amazed 
to see what the children had gone through, and the experience re-minded her of the event’s true purpose.
She said she watched a video 
about a child from Australia that brought her to tears.
 “Hearing his story reminds 
me why I spend so much time and effort working on Dance Marathon,” she said.
Putrino, hospitality chairwom-
an for UF’s Dance Marathon, said she could see the excitement on the children’s faces.
“It was really fun to see how 
much they loved the event and how much they loved that we were there,” she said.

� THE TRIP WILL COST THE 
BILLIONAIRE $35 MILLION.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
CAPE CANAVERAL — Re-
cession or no, billionaire Charles 
Simonyi couldn’t pass up anoth-
er shot at space, even if it meant 
shelling out $35 million more.
Besides, it may one of the last 
times the Russian government al-
lows tourists to hitch a ride to the 
international space station.
“It’s now or never,” said Simo-
nyi, who has now spent $60 mil-lion for a couple of space vaca-
tions. The first was $25 million.
A computer genius who 
helped build Microsoft, Simonyi 
(sih-MOHN’-ee) will become the 
world’s first two-time space tour-ist when he leaves Earth behind Thursday. He’ll be accompanied 
by two professional astronauts — a Russian and American — who will be going up for a six-month 
stint at the space station.
His own trip will last under 
two weeks, and it will be his last.
“I’m not getting any younger,” 
the 60-year-old told The Associ-ated Press in a recent telephone 
interview.
He’ll be one of the older men 
to fly in space, though nowhere 
near John Glenn’s record at age 
77.
Besides, he’s promised his new 
wife, Lisa Persdotter, a 28-year-old Swedish socialite, that this 
will be his final spaceflight.
He told her about his plans 
when they got engaged and “she 
was very supportive, but, but to a limit, mainly. Just once,” Simonyi 
said with a chuckle.
He’s quick to point out this is 
his first marriage, and he’s taking 
one of their engagement rings 
with him into orbit.
The Hungarian-born Simonyi, 
who lives in suburban Seattle, is 
among six rich people who have bought tickets to space through 
Virginia-based Space Adven-
tures.
NASA, the ma-
jor stakeholder in the space station, 
may not love the idea of hosting 
tourists — “spaceflight partici-pants” as it calls them.
But the initial concerns back 
in 2001 have eased over the years with the addition of new guide-lines.
Space station program man-ager Mike Suffredini has spoken 
to Simonyi, just as he has with 
everyone going up, to make sure the visitor understands his limi-tations at the orbiting complex.
“It really has to do with their 
safety,” as well as the safety of the others and the space station it-self, Suffredini said. “They’re ex-tremely restricted” in what they 
can do on the American side.
All this may soon be moot: 
Russian space officials have in-
dicated that after this year, there 
will be no more seats available to 
tourists.
That’s because the space sta-
tion crew is about to double in size to six — hopefully by the end 
of May — and professional fliers 
will fill all the slots.
After he returned from his 
two-week space station trip in April 2007, Simonyi said Russian 
cosmonauts told him how dif-
ferent and rewarding it was to go back up a second time. With doors closing on future tourist 
flights, Simonyi did not want to 
miss out.
Because the training for his 
first flight was so recent, Simonyi got the abridged version, three 
months at cosmonaut headquar-
ters in Star City, Russia, versus six to eight months before. He will return to Earth on April 7 in 
a Soyuz capsule.
“I look at it as a continuation 
of the first flight,” Simonyi said. 
“The reasons are the same. It’s to support space research, it’s to 
popularize civilian space flight 
and communicate the excitement of sciences and engineering to our kids.”
doesn’t include benefits, is about $54,000.
All options will be considered, he said, 
including possibly firing another faculty member.
Meanwhile, Pham said she is happy with the decision, but is still unsure about her future at UF.
She said she doesn’t know what she’ll be teaching or even what department she’ll be in if she’s reinstated.
She also said she will be a year behind 
in her application for tenure.
“I’m not happy at all with the way the 
administrators have run the university, and I’m not alone in this,” she said.
Pham said the way UF handles layoffs during the upcoming budget cut, which should be finalized by mid to late May, will help determine if she stays at UF.
“I just want to see how they’re going to 
do the next cut and how they live up to the agreements that they’ve signed,” she said.
“My heart is no longer here,” she said.

two staff members would be fired, and the 
college would cut about $1.4 million from its $14.3 million budget, Emihovich told about 100 people in the Norman Hall Auditorium.
Four other faculty and staff positions that 
will be vacant next year would be left un-filled, and eight positions would have their funding shifted from state dollars to non-state funds.
In all, salaries would account for about 
$892,000 of the savings. Cuts in operating ex-penses total almost $319,000, while the other personnel services (OPS) budget would be reduced by about $212,000, which could mean hiring fewer or no temporary faculty.
Two graduate degrees – higher education 
administration and educational psychology —   would also be phased out beginning fall 2009, she said, adding that it wouldn’t affect current students.
“All students would be able to complete 
their current degrees,” she said. “We would just simply not take new students in.”
Emihovich said the higher education ad-
ministration degree was targeted for elimi-nation largely because a lack of faculty to teach the required classes, combined with no money to hire new faculty, would make the degree difficult to sustain and could even threaten accreditation in the future.
The educational psychology degree 
would be cut because of low enrollment, she said. There are currently only 17 students in the program, she said.
“I can’t afford to keep resourcing that 
department when I’ve got other programs where I have 100 students in a Ph.D. pro-gram,” she said after the presentation.
Also outlined in the proposal was a plan 
to consolidate three degrees in the counselor education program into one degree. This change wouldn’t affect the curriculum and wouldn’t save any money, but would allow the program to be eligible for more fellow-ships, she said.
Emihovich said some faculty may also 
have to teach different classes or even teach more classes under the proposal.
She said graduate assistants would not 
see their funding reduced, though.
“We don’t wanna cut them,” she said after 
the presentation. “They’re our lifeblood.”
She cautioned that her proposal is only 
a draft and said she is looking forward to hearing suggestions before it’s finalized.“What we really need is ideas,” she said. 
“We have really hard choices.”
During the question and answer session, 
educational psychology professor David Miller asked Emihovich if she could rank the cuts in order of priority in case the col-lege received less than a 10 percent cut, but Emihovich said she couldn’t. 
Miller then offered her some advice about 
what not to cut.
“I think a lot of people would suggest 
you remove the layoffs first,” he said.
Emihovich is the second 
dean to publicly present a 10 percent budget cut proposal, which UF President Bernie Ma-
chen requested from all colleges and admin-istrative units in response to a possible uni-versity-wide budget cut of $72 to $75 million in 2009-2010. 
All proposals are due by April 1 to UF 
Provost Joe Glover, and they will all be made public on April 15, which will open up a period of public discussion until UF’s Board of Trustees approves the final propos-als in May.
Paul D’Anieri, dean of the College of 
Liberal Arts and Sciences, UF’s largest col-lege with about 14,000 students, presented a draft of his proposal Wednesday. Other colleges have presented drafts of their pro-posals to less fanfare, said UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes.
The CLAS proposal includes cutting 
about $9.3 million and laying off the equiva-lent of about 67 faculty and staff positions, according to D’Anieri’s presentation.
The proposal would cut large chunks out 
of the departments of religion and geologi-cal sciences and would move the commu-nication sciences and disorders department to the College of Public Health and Health Professions.
The reasons given by D’Anieri for cutting 
those departments are similar to those cited by Emihovich in discussing possible cuts to programs in her college.
“Both religion and geological sciences 
produce high-quality research, and geologi-cal sciences brings in considerable external funding,” D’Anieri wrote in an e-mail. “But both departments yield relatively small numbers of majors and Ph.D. degrees rela-tive to their budgets.”
Moving the communication sciences and 
disorders department was chosen as an op-tion because “it is less central to the core mission” of CLAS, he wrote.
Dean’s proposal includes four layoffs, cuts to graduate programs

MONDAY, MARCH 23, 2009
By MIKE DiFERDINANDO
Alligator Staff Writer
mdiferdinando@alligator.org
Walter Hodge opened the night with a deep 
three just 13 seconds into the game, and the Gators 
never looked back.
UF (25-10) went on a 20-2 run 
to start the game and cruised to a 
74-60 win against Miami (19-13) 
in the second round of the Na-tional Invitation Tournament on Friday night.
The Hurricanes finally got on 
the board with 14:31 left in the first half.
“It was just the energy,” 
sophomore guard Nick Calathes said. 
“We wanted to come out and play. I think we

Calathes seems to have recaptured the form he 
showed earlier this season. The point guard scored a game-high 21 points and dished out seven as-sists.
He also broke his own single-season school as-

“I love him,” Miami coach Frank Haith said. “He’s as good a point guard as there is in the 
country. If there’s a guy out there that can pass the ball better than him, I want to see him.”

The Gators aren’t ready to call it quits just 
yet.
No. 8-seed UF (24-7) played loose and 
inspired basketball  Sunday and showed no 
sign of postseason inexperience as it knocked 
out No.9-seed Temple (21-10) 70-57 in the first 
round of the NCAA Tournament in Storrs, Conn.
The Gators’ reward for advancing to the 
second round for the first time since 2004: a meeting with No. 1 overall seed Connecticut (34-0) on Tuesday night on the Huskies’ home court.
It didn’t take long for the team to turn its 
attention to the next opponent.
“I’m just glad that I can say the words 
UConn now because I’ve had to hold it in for a whole week,” UF assistant coach Susie Gard-ner said. “I’ve scouted them and not been able to say anything, except I called some friends just to talk about UConn just to get it out of my system. But now I can finally say it out loud. So I’m a little relieved there as well.”
The Gators shot lights out in the first half 
against the Owls, draining just over 60 percent of their shots and building a 41-33 advantage at the break.
Temple closed to within 4 early in the sec-
ond half and chipped into UF’s lead on sever-al occasions, but the Gators were in complete control throughout.
“We knew that Temple was going to come 
out fast, and they did,” Gardner said. “But we felt like we were probably in better shape, and UF downs Temple, to face UConn

■ ONLY 7 OF THE TEAM’S 12 
MEMBERS COMPETED.
By EUGENIO TORRENS
Alligator Writer
The UF gymnastics roster has 
12 names on it. Only seven of those 
names were able to compete at the Southeastern Conference Champi-
onships on Saturday.
As depleted as the team was, 
the seven gymnasts competing fin-
ished third with a score of 196.75, the team’s fourth best score this season.
“The team inside and outside 
of the arena was amazing,” junior 
Melanie Sinclair said. “Under these 
circumstances, under this pressure, under everything that’s been going on, we were able to pull out third place? That’s amazing. That’s phe-nomenal.”
The team drew the Olympic 
rotation, meaning it was the same format as home meets: vault, un-
even bars, balance beam and floor 
exercise.
The Gators opened up on vault 
with a 49.2 thanks to a pair of 9.85s from Sinclair and Maranda Smith. Corey Hartung, who returned to the competitive lineup for the first 
time since the Feb. 28 meet against 
Georgia, turned 
in a season-best score of 9.9.
UF coach 
Rhonda Faehn credited Har-tung’s return as 
an enormous boost for the whole 
team.
“To do as amazing as she did 
with the limited amounts of train-
ing going into the competition was just phenomenal,” Faehn said.
Hartung said she spent the 
weekend mentally preparing her-
self, envisioning how she wanted 
her routines to go and blocking out her injured calf, which she said was still tight.
The Gators moved to bars, 
where Hartung’s return was un-deniably noticeable. With only five gymnasts on the bars lineup, there was no room for error, and the team 
responded with a 49.375, the best 
bars score for the Gators since they hosted Kentucky on Jan. 30.
Hartung and Sinclair posted 9.95s, good for second overall. Smith pitched in a 9.9 and all-arounders Elizabeth Mahlich and 
Courtney Gladys scored 9.8 and 
9.775, respectively.
“We had only five people on 
bars. Normally that would make it a stressful situation,” Faehn said. “This team did not respond that way. They were very calm. They performed aggressively there.”
Beam was the Gators’ only per-
ceivable hiccup. The team’s 48.825 was fueled by Sinclair and Gladys’ Gators knock 
off Hurricanes

Despite getting just 2 1/3 innings from preseason ace Pat-
rick Keating, UF (14-7, 3-3 Southeastern Conference) was able 
to come from behind and record a 7-5 victory Sunday in McK-ethan Stadium, completing the weekend sweep of Tennessee (9-12, 1-5 SEC). 
Freshman Alex Panteliodis (2-2, 4.44 ERA), who has been 
used primarily as a starter this season, replaced Keating in the third and pitched four scoreless innings, giving the Gators’ of-fense a chance to climb back in the game after being down 4-2 after three innings.
“(I was) very surprised it was that early,” Panteliodis said. 
“I expected Pat to go a little bit longer, but it happens. It’s hap-pened to me.”
In Panteliodis’ second relief appearance of the season, he al-
lowed two hits and walked one batter while keeping an inher-ited runner at third base after coming in with one out.“I thought he did an outstanding job and changed the mo-
mentum for us,” UF coach Kevin O’Sullivan said.
Keating struggled early, and the Volunteers were able to 
capitalize on his ineffectiveness. Tennessee scored 3 runs in the first two innings behind a pair of doubles.
UF third baseman Clayton Pisani made a throwing error on 
the first play of the game, putting Josh Liles, who would score the first run, on first base. Keating gave up back-to-back singles in the second before Zach Osborne dropped one just inside the right-field line, scoring 2 more runs for Tennessee.
Though Keating’s last two outings have been a poor start 
and a blown save, O’Sullivan said he isn’t nervous about his leader in the rotation.“He’s too good of a pitcher,” he said. “He’s had too much 
success for him not to turn his performance around.”
While the Volunteers got on the scoreboard early, the 
Gators hit into two double plays with the bases loaded in the first three innings and took a little longer to get to Volunteers starter Bryan Morgado.
In the seventh inning, senior left fielder Avery Barnes tripled 
home Adams and scored on a pinch-hit single from freshman 
Preston Tucker, giving the Gators a 6-4 lead.
The Gators needed help from the top of the lineup in Friday 
night’s series opener as well, and junior center fielder Matt den 
Dekker more than answered the call. Down 2-1 in the bottom of the eighth inning with two outs and a runner on third, the newly anointed leadoff man blasted a home run over the right-field wall, giving UF a 3-2 win.
“A play like that can certainly ignite a team,” O’Sullivan 
said. 
The Gators came out swinging in Game 2 on Saturday and 
ran away with a 10-2 victory behind first-inning home runs from Barnes and Buddy Munroe.UF BASEBALLPanteliodis excels in relief role, gets win against UT

With her team down 1-0 to Tennessee in 
the bottom of the fourth inning Sunday, Sta-
cey Nelson stepped out of the UF dugout, en-ergizing the home crowd and telling them the Gators were about to get back into the game.
“This is it!” Nelson screamed to the fans. 
“We’re getting it right here!” 
As the senior pitcher promised, UF tied 
the game that inning and pulled ahead with a 3-run fifth, taking them to a 4-1 win over the Volunteers in Game 3 of the weekend se-ries. With the victory, the No. 1 Gators (32-2, 11-0 Southeastern Conference) completed the sweep of the No. 6 Volunteers (24-6, 2-3 SEC).
Nelson (17-2, 0.39 ERA) has primarily led 
by example during her career — and she con-tinued to do so this weekend by striking out 21 batters and only giving up eight hits in 14 in-
nings — but her mid-game guarantee brought 
a noticeable change in her leadership tactics.
“I’ve kind of taken on the role as the pump-
up leader, or tried to at least,” Nelson said. 
With the sweep of the Volunteers, the 
Gators pushed their win streak to 21 games.
“Any time you’re looking at an opportu-
nity to win a conference championship, you need to take some sweeps,” UF coach Tim Walton said. “You’ve got to beat great teams, and we beat a great team this weekend. I was really proud of the way we played.”
After losing 7-0 twice on Saturday, Tennes-
see made adjustments before Game 3, and it took UF nearly half the game to catch up. The Gators took advantage of the high number of 
inside pitches they saw Sat-urday, but Volunteers pitcher 
Cat Hosfield went outside and 
away on Sunday. 
UF made its own adjust-
ments in the fourth inning. With two outs and two strikes 
on the board, center fielder Michelle Moultrie 
tied the game at 1 with an infield single that 
drove in Brooke Johnson. The next inning, the top of the order came through with 3 runs on three straight doubles from Kelsey Bruder, Ali Gardiner and Francesca Enea.
“The whole game, we were trying to make 
adjustments because Tennessee came out to-day for Game 3 with a lot better adjustments and pitched us completely different than they did in the two games before,” Gardiner said.
The Gators came out on fire in their Sat-
urday doubleheader. Corrie Brooks was the 
hero at the plate in Game 1, as her third-inning 
grand slam — her third of the season — put UF ahead 5-0.
With the win in Game 1, Walton became 
the winningest coach in UF softball history, and he immediately added to his record in the 
next game. 
Sophomore Stephanie Brombacher (15-0, 
0.67 ERA) held the Volunteers to just two hits 
in Game 2 while striking out nine batters. Nelson energizes crowd, team in weekend sweep of Vols

9.775.
UF finished the meet on floor, and be-
cause it was the last event for the Gators, Faehn decided to put Hartung in after 
she was slated to only do vault, bars and 
beam.
The decision paid off, as Hartung led 
the team with a 9.925. 
“I knew the coaches and the trainers 
were iffy about it,” Hartung said. “I knew I wanted to do it, so it was in my head that I was going to do floor. I didn’t have any doubt that I could do it.”
Smith captured her second 9.9 of the 
night, and Sinclair and Amy Ferguson turned in 9.85s to give the Gators their third highest floor total this season, a 49.35.
The Gators’ third-place finish was a bit 
of a surprise given their disastrous injury situation. Two of the schools UF beat out for third, LSU and Arkansas, were road 
opponents the Gators lost to earlier this 
season.
“One thing we know is to absolutely 
never underestimate this team,” Faehn said. “Many people have counted us out with the injuries we had. That gave this team more motivation.”18, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, MARCH 23, 2009

Junior swimmer Gemma Spof-
forth makes a habit out of setting 
records, and her performance at the NCAA Championships meet in Col-lege Station, Texas, proved that.
Spofforth dominated from the 
start of the weekend by placing fourth in the 200-yard individual medley with a time of 1:54.73, beating her previous UF record of 1:55.39. On the final day, Spofforth, freshman Teresa Crippen and junior 
Stephanie Proud also swept the 200-
yard back, giving UF its 100th na-tional title. 
Spofforth said she swims for her 
coaches and for her mom.
“I lost my mom about a year and 
a half ago, and when I look up at the board, I do it for her,” she said.
Her coaches helped her overcome 
the “post-Olympic blues” and have pushed her to the high level she’s maintained all season. She repaid them for their effort this weekend.“Gemma Spofforth has been out-
standing, not only in the pool, but as a leader of this team,” UF coach Gregg Troy said.
Spofforth and the other Gators women selected for the NCAA 
snatched a seventh-place finish this 
weekend, placing in the top 10 for the ninth consecutive year. Thir-teen swimmers and divers captured 34 All-American honors including honorable mentions, with Spofforth leading the pack.
Other standouts included fresh-
man Jemma Lowe and Crippen, 
who placed fourth in the 200 but-
terfly and set a UF record in the 400-yard IM, respectively.
“We have a promising future because we probably had the most 
freshman at this meet,” Troy said. 
“And the good news for us is they’re all returning.”
The team is proud of its seventh-
place finish, but Spofforth believes there is still more within her reach. Her tenure on the UF swimming and diving team is not over yet.
“Each and every day was harder 
and harder,” Spofforth said. “Next year (my senior year), I’d like to make it on the first-, second- and third-place platform.”

if we could continue, we might get the lead and sustain it.”
Seniors Sha Brooks and Marshae Dot-
son didn’t hold back in their first trip to the Big Dance in three years.
Brooks tallied a game-high 18 points, 
while Dotson, who started 4-of-4 shoot-ing, totaled 13. Junior Steffi Sorensen gave the Gators another big boost with her 13 points and 13 rebounds along with three assists and three steals.
Sorensen, as she has done for much of 
the season, got her hands on seemingly every loose ball, tipping it to a teammate if she couldn’t corral it.
“She was a little disappointed, ironi-
cally, after the game,” Gardner said. “I said, ‘What’s wrong?’ She said, ‘I had too 
many turnovers.’ But that’s the type of com-petitor that she is.”
As well as the Gators 
shot against the Owls, Gardner was remind-
ed that she was in the stands for the day’s first game to watch the Hus-kies shoot 74 percent in 
the first half.
“I thought we just shot well for the 
game, and now I got my feelings hurt,” Gardner said jokingly.
UF is in a position now where it will 
have everything to gain and seemingly very little to lose when it takes on Con-necticut in the second round. 
Gardner said she’s looking forward 
to seeing how her team stacks up against one of the best.
“It’s a great challenge,” Gardner said. 
“It’s fun to scout them. It’s fun to think 
about playing perhaps one of the best 
teams in history. 
“We aren’t going to have to use any 
motivational tactics at all except talk about them, and they’ll be excited.”
A radio broadcast contributed to this re-
port.UF excited for tough second-round opponent
Werner managed to score 12 points and grab six rebounds.
UF held Miami star Jack 
McClinton to just 13 points on 5-of-12 shooting.
“We dug ourselves a hole 
and just couldn’t get back into the game,” McClinton said.
UF played what may have 
been its best game of the sea-son against Miami, and it seems the disappointment of missing out on the NCAA Tournament has given way to a new goal.
“In a lot ways, they’re just 
out there playing now,” UF coach Billy Donovan said. “I’m not saying there is not any pressure because I know in those guys, there is pres-sure. 
“I think any time you step 
on the court there is always a level that you want to perform and you want the team to do well. But I think for them, just their attitude and disposition the last week or so has been good.”
UF will now host Penn State (24-11) Tuesday night at 9 in the NIT quarterfinals with a trip to Madison Square Garden on the line.

man Allan

not on the bench for the Gators

“He’s suspended for the

the team or anything else. It was really more my decision. I’m not going into detail about any of it.”
Chaney had been out for

The video starts with a jolt.
The running back takes a han-
doff, but by the time he grips the ball, he’s already bracing for impact. From off-screen, a white blur dash-
es through the offensive line un-
touched and plows straight through the hapless back.
Ball and carrier are separated in-
stantly, and both lie motionless on the turf for a moment.
That blur, the one that moves too 
fast for even the slow-motion replay, is Olney (Md.) Our Lady of Good Counsel High linebacker Jelani Jen-kins. The highlight tape is almost four minutes long, but the first five seconds are all it takes to realize Jen-
kins’ sky-high potential.
“One of the recruiters saw that 
first hit, and he shut the tape off 
and said, ‘He’s got a scholarship,’” Jelani’s father, Maurice, said. “He didn’t need to see any more.”
But that hit isn’t the most impres-
sive part of the highlight, nor are the other crushing blows, rushing 
touchdowns or catches that follow.
It’s the date the video was up-
loaded to YouTube.com: Nov. 23, 
2007. The plays are from Jenkins’ ju-nior season. He was 15 years old.
He has accelerated through life in 
much the same manner that he ac-celerated through that poor back. 
Now, after turning 17 earlier this 
month, Jenkins is preparing to enter the major college football landscape when he joins the UF football team this summer.
He’ll be five years younger than 
UF linebacker Ryan Stamper when he arrives in Gainesville, but if his past performances are any indica-tion, age won’t be a problem.
“I always have to keep remind-
ing people that he’s 16 years old,” Maurice said in February. “He should be playing JV instead of var-sity. When he was 14, he was play-ing offense and defense on varsity against 18-year-olds — and domi-
nating them.”
Destined for Stardom
Jenkins’ road to becoming a 
sought-after recruit and decorated 
student-athlete started at the Roots Public Charter School in Washing-ton, D.C., a school that stresses Afri-
can heritage and holistic education. 
At Roots, students advance 
through grades based on individual 
progress, and they’re grouped in a multi-grade fashion to stimulate de-velopment. Students in grades five through eight take classes together, as do first- through fourth-graders, so the younger children are exposed 
to more advanced knowledge and 
the older children learn how to be role models and leaders.
Jenkins flourished in this envi-
ronment, skipping a grade and ex-celling despite being younger than his peers from the first grade on.
Maurice, a well-known architect 
in the D.C. area, stressed to his son 
that “age is just a number,” making 
it clear that nothing should stop him from achieving his goals.
“I remember telling him when he 
was younger that every time he gets the ball, he’s supposed to score,” Maurice said. “I would smile to my-self because he went out there think-ing he should score every time.”
The mentality caught on, and one 
afternoon Jenkins put that plan into action. When he was 8 years old, he ripped off 300 rushing yards in one game, scoring on runs of 85, 65 and 99 yards.That was all it took to convince 
Maurice his son was destined for a great football career. But Jenkins was more interested in playing hard-hitting defense, a sentiment that was clear each time he carried the ball.
“He had this thing about knock-
ing kids out,” Maurice said. “Every game, he was just a little guy, but he 
would knock out two or three guys 
a game — and he was running the ball.”
Jenkins’ reputation as a big hitter 
was partially due to one of his other hobbies. By age 9, he was a second-
degree brown belt in karate — he 
was too young to be awarded a black belt — and the skills he learned in that sport helped him lay waste to opponents on the gridiron.
“We used to break boards, and 
they always told us to go through the board. Don’t hit the board, go through it. So that mentality helps me out when I hit.”
Maurice said: “The analysts say 
he’s not a big hitter, he’s a violent hitter. There’s a difference.”
Jenkins’ playing style drew atten-
tion from private high schools in the area, and he enrolled at Good Coun-sel High for ninth grade.
As Jenkins and Falcons coach 
Bob Milloy are quick to point out, he 
didn’t get off to a fast start, but at the 
end of the freshman team’s season, he gave an indication of what he would provide in the future.
When tailback Caleb Porzel — who signed with Maryland this year 
— was injured before the season fi-
nale against rival DeMatha Catholic High, Jenkins filled in and ran for three touchdowns. 
The performance helped con-
vince Milloy that Jenkins was ready for the next level. The following year, Jenkins joined the varsity squad and became a two-way starter at fullback 
and linebacker at 14 years old.
Stepping Into the Spotlight
In his junior season, Jenkins put 
together another defining game 
against DeMatha. The Stags, who have won the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference football cham-
pionship six years running, entered 
the matchup having not lost a con-ference game in 1,114 days.
Jenkins ran for 79 yards and a 
touchdown in his team’s 28-24 win, and he set the tone early with his jaw-dropping hit on Stags running back Ashby Christian. Skip past the clip of his hit on Christian, and 
there’s a better play, one that Milloy 
lists as his favorite.
On the play, DeMatha receiver 
Rodney McLeod — who played in nine games for Virginia last season as a defensive back — catches a slant pass, spins off the safety and seems destined for a touchdown.
There’s no one in front of him, 
and the speedy Division-1 prospect has a solid 5-yard head start on the nearest defensive player, Jenkins.
But Jenkins accelerates in a heart-
beat and closes the gap on McLeod with a frightening burst of speed. He dives, extends his right arm and drags McLeod down instantly, and when Jenkins bounces back up, he’s 
holding the ball.
In one fluid motion, Jenkins made 
the tackle and took the ball.
“The referee said it wasn’t a fum-
ble, and after the game, I brought it 
up,” Milloy said. “He said, ‘Coach, I blew that one. I’ve never seen any-one do that in my life. I blew that, and I apologize.’ (McLeod) is a good 
athlete, and Jelani ended up with the 
ball before they hit the ground.”
Jenkins racked up awards, in-
cluding the 2007 and 2008 Maryland Gatorade Player of the Year titles, and he was rated the nation’s top outside linebacker by Rivals.com.
The Matrix
Jenkins put together a solid ca-
reer on offense, but defense always held more of an allure.
“On defense, you don’t know 
what they’re going to do, so the 
challenge is figuring that out,” he 
said. “You can always be in the play on defense. Unless you’re a quar-terback, you’re not really in control, but if you’re on defense you can run anywhere you want.”
His love of a mental challenge 
benefited him off the field as well.
With a GPA above 4.0, Jenkins 
became the first player in the 71-year history of the Pigskin Club of Washington, D.C., to win defensive player and scholar athlete of the year awards. He’s so focused on school that he’s even reluctant to miss class for a good reason.
“This is a kid who’s whistling in 
the morning when it’s time to go to school,” Maurice said. “On National Signing Day, he said, ‘Dad, how long is this going to be? I don’t want to miss any of my classes.’ I said, ‘It’s OK, this is your day. You’ll be all right.’”
When Jenkins made an all-state 
team, he was supposed to drive to the Baltimore Ravens’ M&T Bank 
Stadium to have his picture taken. 
But even with the principal’s permis-sion, Jenkins refused to skip class.
“Now, he has an ‘A’ in the class 
already, and he’s graduating in three months, so I’m thinking to myself, ‘Who the hell really cares?’” Milloy said. “But he did not get his picture taken. They had to go to the archives 
and get it, and he wasn’t in the team 
picture either because he was afraid of missing this class.”
With his two-way ability, vicious 
hitting, blazing speed and high marks in school, Jenkins drew tons of attention from colleges across the country. To sort through all his pos-sible destinations, Jenkins and his 
family devised a matrix to rate each 
school in a variety of categories, such as diversity, national academic ranking and current football record.
Then, they narrowed the list to 
15 schools and ranked the categories by what was most important, and the computer program played a big role in his decision to play 800 miles 
from home on signing day.
“When we ranked the teams, the 
top five out of the 15 were colored 
green and the lowest five were red,” Jenkins said. “Florida was green all the way across the board, and it was the only school that did that. That’s how Florida jumped out at us.”
Great Expectations
The bar has been high for Jenkins 
ever since he signed with the Gators on Feb. 4. 
At his press conference that day, 
UF coach Urban Meyer gushed 
about Jenkins’ talent, his attitude 
and his family — his mother, Steph-anie Hall, played basketball at How-ard University and has a black belt.
“I’ll be disappointed if he’s not a 
captain at Florida some day,” Meyer said.
But at 6-foot-1, 200 pounds and 17 
years of age, Jenkins is likely to need 
some time to develop. His speed is 
game-ready — he ran the 40-yard dash in just over 4.4 seconds — but Jenkins will have to pack on some weight before he can play linebacker in the Southeastern Conference.
But the good news is he’s still not 
done growing, and a spurt could make him the replacement for Bran-
don Spikes at middle linebacker.
“His dad is about 6-4, 260 and re-
ally put together,” Milloy said. “He 
has two more years of growing. He could be a 6-foot-4, 240-pound line-backer. His upside, physically, is un-believable.”
Whether he hits a growth spurt 
or not, Jenkins’ age won’t faze him. 
It has never been any other way.
“My whole life, I’ve been the 
younger one and adapted to peo-
ple older than me,” Jenkins said. “I was constantly reminded that I was younger, but I never really saw it that way. Age has never been a problem for me.”AHEAD OF HIS CLASS

three days of March Madness.
From Thursday to Sunday, 
you were treated to non-stop bas-ketball. 
There were plenty of close 
games, upsets and late heroics, giving you a reason to skip class and put off everything else.
You could even watch games 
live on your computer, a tactic I 
saw masterfully orchestrated by 
a few guys in one of my classes Friday. 
They had all the current games 
streaming at once (though one of the guys had to close out of a few Web sites mom wouldn’t be proud of first).
Anyway, as you trudge 
through this week toward the next round of games on Thurs-day, let me give you a few things to occupy your time.First off, check out our podcast. 
It’s available on iTunes (search “alligatorSports Podcast”) and 
usually runs anywhere from 45 
to 90 minutes. 
You can subscribe to it, load it 
on your iPod and fill your previ-
ously boring bus rides with our 
banter on all things sports — like who belongs on the Mount Rush-more of Gators athletics, a col-lege football playoff and general 
updates and discussions on all 
UF teams.
In two new segments, we’ll 
dish out our Reggie Nelson 
Awards for Excellence in the 
Field of Sport and Kyle Jackson Bad Angles of the Week. and at the end, we’ll give you an idea of what you can buy off your TV 
at the ungodly hour of the morn-
ing that we finish the podcast. Last week we ended at 3:13 a.m., and I’m ashamed of my level of knowledge about what they were 
selling.
I can’t 
guaran-
tee you’ll 
agree with 
a n y t h i n g we say, but I promise 
we’ll live up to our new motto: 
“The alligatorSports Podcast: 
Maybe it sucks, but it still sounds better than Deadspin’s.”
Speaking of time-wasters that 
have gone from boring to semi-interesting, check out the MLS. 
Yes, that’s right, American 
soccer. 
The MLS season got underway 
last week, and I’m going to give it a chance. 
The season runs from March 
through November, filling a big gap in my sports calendar be-tween college basketball and football, and I’ve pledged my al-
legiance to the newly formed Se-
attle Sounders.
They sold out their first game, 
a 3-0 win against the L.A. Galaxy, 
and will host the MLS Cup after 
selling 20,000 season tickets be-fore their first game.
And now, the best time-waster 
I can offer you. 
Remember UF safety Tony 
Joiner’s run-in at a Gainesville tow lot in 2007? 
Well, that provoked the great-
est production in Alligator his-tory.
Go to our online archives, 
search “Tony Joiner,” click the Oct. 2 article with “BREAKING” 
in the headline and read the 452 
comments.
Some of them are inappropri-
ate and/or offensive, but most of them are hilarious. 
They range from poking fun 
at a few football players to ref-
erences of Rhett Bomar, Ruben 
Boumtje-Boumtje, the Hills, Hope Solo, Mel Gibson, Tay Zon-day, Arrested Development and 
Seinfeld. 
One of my favorite comments, 
near the bottom, is from “Richard 
Belding” and states, “What the hell is going on here?”
Since most of the comments 
came within minutes of each oth-er, it looks like a few friends were responsible for them. 
Reading it should kill half 
an hour, and if you know who it was, e-mail me because these heroes need to be recognized for their effort.
If none of my ideas keep you 
occupied, I guess you can watch NIT games — if you’re into that sort of thing.
