Defense
Defined-
By KYLE MAISTRI how it feels to be on the highest high -not
Alligator Staff Writer letting teams score -and we know how it
The Florida defense had reached its low
point.
The yearbefore, an experienced unit led
the Gators to a national championship and
gained a reputation as one of the toughest
defenses in the country.
Plenty of roster turnover morphed the
2007 version into a group of young, talented
players who were still searching for an indi-
vidual and collective identity.
Michigan handed UF its fourth loss of the
season in the Capital One Bowl after Chad
Henne threw for 373 yards and the Wolver-
ines piled up 524 yards of total offense on
their way to a 41-35 win.
Eight players who started on defense that
day are still on the team, and three of them
-Brandon Spikes, Joe Haden and Major
Wright -are still starters.
But it was time for a unit that allowed
opponents to score 25.5 points per game to
make a change.
Not in personnel, but attitude.
"I don't think (that motivated them).
I know so," UF coach Urban Meyer said.
"You could see the edge coming out of that
bowl game that day."
How would the members of the defense
allow themselves to be defined for the rest
of their careers?
04
swag (swag) ad]. : the way one carries oneself;
style, confidence or appearance.
"My weakness was basicallyI didn't have
the swag."- UF comerback Joe Haden
04
None of them did.
Swag is an attitude that comes with suc-
cess.
It grows with every sack, interception
and goal-line stand.
The 2008 defense was a year older and
too proud to take the beating week-in and
week-out the way it did during the previous
9-4 season.
"(2007) helped us a whole lot to never
want that to happen again -being theerea-
son that you lose a game, you feel like it's all
your fault," Haden said. "The offenseswould
put up 45 points a game, and we would still
almost lose. So with the defense, we knowfeels to be low, when everybody is just look-
ing at you like you're the worst defense in
the country."
In 2007, players got playing time on de-
fense because there was no one else ready
to step in if a guy faltered. That all changed
when the team reported for practice the fol-
lowing spring.
No one's job was safe, everyone was be-
ing pushed by the guy behind them on the
depth chart, and experience was starting to
become a strength rather than a weakness.
"There was something that needed to be
corrected, but a lot of it was the youth of
that defense, it really was," defensive line
coach Dan McCarney said. "You see, fortu-
nately right now, a lot of those guys who
didn't play really well three years ago have
played really well these past two years."
Going through growing pains together
focused a young team forthe next season, a
shot at redemption.
The team responded by cutting its
points-allowed total in half, giving up just
12.9 points per game on the way to the
Gators' second national championship in
three years.
The offense was explosive, but the de-
fense became one of the team's greatest
strengths, holding the highest scoring of-
fense i college football history to 14 points
in the BCS National Championship Game.
The tone was set on a jarring hit in the
first five minutes of the game, when UF
safety Major Wright leveled Oklahoma re-
ceiver Manny Johnson on daeep sidelineroute.
"(Opening up the game with a big hit)
lets the receivers know that I'm here,"
Wright said.
That's swag.

hype (hip) ad].: readyto go, prepared.
"it gets us hype before every game."

Four boxes of graham crackers,
three bags of M&M's and a contain-
er of frosting was all it took to build
the Great Wall of China.
Luckily, there was still some left
over for the Reitz Union and Ben
Hill Griffin Stadium.
Members of the UF chapter of
Habitat for Humanity held their
third annual Candy House Building
Competition Thursday afternoon on
the Reitz Union North Lawn.
More than 40 people voted for
their favorite of five gingerbread
houses decorated with M&M's,
Mike and Ikes, Life Savers and can-
dy canes. Each house was built by a
team of two from the UF Habitat for
Humanity.
"Last time I built one, I was in
first grade, so it brought back some
memories," said Stephany Vento,spring fundraising chairwoman for
the club.
The graham cracker replica of the
Great Wall of China earned the most
votes, with Barbie's Malibu Dream
House coming in second.
The three other candy-covered
masterpieces were built to look like

Gators stomp for kids
By ALISON SCHWARTZ
Alligator Writer
Technicolor lights bounced off the
walls at Rum Runners, an acoustic artist
hummed in the background and Ashley
Miller sipped the beer she had received.
She was one of an estimated 500 people
who flocked downtown for Stompin' for
the Holidays, the fall semester version of
Gator Stompin'.
"I'm a senior," she said. "This is some-
thing that you have to do in Gainesville be-
fore you leave."
Organized by the Pledge 5 Foundation,
the seasonal celebration transformed down-
town Gainesville into a pub and restaurant
crawl as participants weaved in and out of
local hot spots.
The event kicked off at Rum Runners,
where a Southeastern Conference Champi-
onship pep rally set the tone for an evening
of mingling and mixed drinks.
A Gainesville tradition since 1983, par-
ticipants paid a base admission fee and re-ceived a lanyard and 10 tickets redeemable
for food, drinks and entry into raffles at
about 20 vendors, including Shooting Star
Japanese Grill & Sushi, Lux, The Gelato
Company and Skyy night club.
"It's the holiday season. Students
don't have a lot to give in terms of
monetary donations, but they can
afford a toy."
Jason Bowman
Stompin' for the Holidays coordinator
But the fest was more than a good time.
The event raised awareness for Toys for
Tots, an organization dedicated to distrib-
uting toys to children from economically
disadvantaged families.
From action figures to board games, par-
ticipants were encouraged to donate a toy.
Jason Bowman, the event coordinator,

Students with a homework as-
signment to organize a protest did
just that Thursday afternoon on
Turlington Plaza, choosing to dem-
onstrate against escalating educa-
tion costs.
The students, enrolled in a class
called "Social Problems," protested
UF's 15 percent tuition increase,
changes to the Bright Futures schol-
arship and the proposed student fee
to fund part of the $70 million to $80
million in Reitz Union renovations,
among other things.Their teacher, Meggan Jordan 
-
a graduate student -joined in as
students marched in a circle, hoist-
ed homemade signs and chanted
phrases like "We
say no! Our fees
must go!"
"The theme of
the class has been
speaking out,
speaking truth to
power and know-Jo'dan ing when you're
getting screwed," Jordan said.
Students who didn't feel like
participating were allowed to sit
the protest out, she said.

County to provide
free HIN vacci nes
Gators who forgot to sign up for
HINI vaccines at the Student Health
Care Center will have another shot
Saturday.
Vaccines will be given at four
sites around the county: Fellowship
Church of High Springs, Easton-New-
berry Sports Complex, Trinity United
Methodist Church and First Baptist
Church Waldo. All locations will give
vaccines from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. except
First Baptist Church Waldo, which
will be open from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Both the injectable and nasal mist
form of the vaccine will be offered.
The Alachua County Health De-
partment does not expect to run out
of vaccines, and vaccinating high risk
groups will be a priority.
The groups at highest risk are preg-
nant women, health care and emer-
gency workers, people who live with
or care for infants, children between 6months and 4 years and children be-
tween 5 years and 18 years who have
pre-existing conditions.
Once those groups have received
their vaccinations, people between 5
and 24 years old and people between
25 and 64 who have pre-existing con-
ditions will be next in line.
"We are encouraging citizens who
are most at risk for severe complica-
tions from HINI swine
Local flu to receive the vac-
News cination," wrote Jean
Munden, administrator
of the health department, in a press
release. "Getting a vaccination is the
primary means of preventing infec-
tion."

Zen Run to benefit children
By HILARY SHEINBAUM
Alligator Contributing Writer
After overeating at Thanksgiving and with
stressful finals fast approaching, Gainesville
residents might appreciate a Saturday run.
Zen Fitness will hold the Zen 5K and 10K
Race For Childhood Wellness Saturday at Haile
Plantation Village Center, 5110 SW 91st Drive.
The event benefits the Zen Fitness Childhood
Wellness Program.
The program involves an essay contest in
January at local middle and high schools, in-
cluding Gainesville High School and Kanapaha
Middle School. The students will write about
diet and nutrition.
Winners receive nine weeks of training,
books and educational material promoting a
healthy lifestyle, said Matt Bakos, Zen Fitness
trainer and applied physiology and kinesiology
senior.
This year's race is the first Zen Run, but or-
ganizers hope to make the run an annual event,
Bakos said.
Bakos, the event's organizer, expects about
400 runners at the event. Of the 400, he estimates
about 75 to 100 will be UT students, including
members of the track and triathlon clubs.
The run's route circles an 18-hole golf course.The route will be marked with signs, and volun-
teers will be on every turn.
Awards will be given to the fastest male and
female runners in six age groups. Other race-
day events include massages, raffles, food and

snacks, according to the event flier.
"I enjoy running because it's not only a good
exercise and easy to do," environmental engi-
neering junior Aniela Burant said. "It's a great
way to turn negative energy into positive ener-
gy. Non-runners should start running because
it's a wonderful way to get into shape and to
make yourself feel better as a whole."
The 5K and 10K start at 9 a.m. Registration
begins at 8 a.m. Race-day registration is $15 for
the 5K and $20 for the 10K. Runners can pay $25
for the 5K and $30 for the 10K to receive a T-shirt
and register for the run.
Participants can preregister at thezenfitness.

Lacrosse team gives tour
0 THE FACILITIES OPENED
IN AUGUST.
By DEREK GILLIAM
Alligator Contributing Writer
The UF women's lacrosse team facili-
ties were on display as head coach Amanda
O'Leary gave a tour of the new facilities to the
Academic & Professional Assembly Thursday
afternoon.
The APA is an organization comprised of
UF administrators who provide communica-
tion with faculty, said Connie Nicklin, presi-
dent of the APA.
The assembly had about 25 members par-
ticipate in the tour.
"We try to provide access to people our
assembly would usually not have," Nicklin
said.
The facilities, located on Hull Road just
south of the softball field, were absolutely out-
standing, said Christine Schoaff, past presi-
dent of the APA and a former lacrosse player.
"I don't think I have ever seen such pret-ty manicured grass in one place," said Rick
Goodnight, assembly program chairman.
O'Leary said few programs have both a
practice field and a game field.

A program co-sponsored by the University
Athletic Association and UF Alumni Associa-
tion is scoring big for students.
With the Pay for Performance Florida Foot-
ball Challenge, the George A. Smathers librar-
ies were able to raise more than $5,000, which
will fund the improvement of library resources
and extend study time.
The libraries received donations ranging
from 25 cents to $100 every time the Gators
scored a touchdown in the regular season.
There is also talk of donations for touchdowns
in the Southeastern Conference championship
this weekend.
Samuel Huang, the libraries' associate dean
for advancement and development, said the
money will be used to meet growing student
and faculty research and learning needs.
"All the money we raise will be to upgrade
and refresh technology for the students," he
said. "Everything is to benefit the students."
The idea for the program, which is the first
of its kind among any of the SEC schools, came
from 13-year-old Brent Carris. During the 2009BCS championship game, he asked his father,
Richard Carris, library leadership board di-
rector, if he would give money every time the
Gators scored a touchdown.
Brent's question inspired his father, a UF
graduate, to take action and get Urban Meyer
on board for support.
"All the money we raise will be to
upgrade and refresh technology
for the students. Everything is to
benefit the students."

"The main reason for this was that I basi-
cally thought How many hours do you spend
going to the library versus going to a football
game?' he said.
Huang said another pledge drive is planned
for basketball season, The Florida Basketball
3-point Challenge.

EditorialSo you're finally ready to dump all the knowledge you
(hopefully) absorbed over the semester in a cathartic flurry
of finals, term papers and unnecessarily harsh "Rate My
Professors" rants?
Well, since you won't be retaining a drop of this knowl-
edge, you'll have a lot of space in that hollow, post-test head of
yours to fill over winter break. And on that note, we're happy
to present you with a don't-worry-about-your-calculus-grade-
you-can-learn-more-important-lessons-outside-the-classroom
edition of.
Darts & Laurels
To prove the very point that learning doesn't stop at lecture
hall doors (or at the end of a Smokin' Notes packet), filmmak-
ers descended on Gainesville last summer to record the life
of Melinda Augustus, a custodian at the Florida Museum of
Natural History.
The film, "The Philosopher Kings," follows Augustus as
she tells her story and focuses on seven other custodians from
universities across the nation. The lesson: "Wisdom can come
from more than just textbooks and teachers."
For candidly telling her life story and giving Gainesville
and Alachua residents a spot in the media they can truly be
proud of, we would like to give a keep-smiling-and-we're
bound-to-learn-something LAUREL to Melinda Augustus.
Unfortunately, not all of the lessons we will encounter over
break are positive ones.
Even the most benign and relatively insignificant events
can provide a stinging lesson of regret. And it is with regret
that we report Florida State University has beaten UF in a Fa-
cebook competition for a free Weezer concert.
While we find Weezer mildly amusing, we probably
wouldn't have gone to the show -even if it was free. But los-
ing to FSU at just about anything, including trivial Facebook
contests. well, it's just plain unbearable.
So we have to throw a this-wasn't-an-SG-election-so-we-
expected-a-better-turnout DART at UF students and alumni.
The lesson: Online voting probably won't help low voter inter-
est in UF elections. Maybe try relevance?
One of the most difficult out-of-the-classroom lessons this
week was learned by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Hukabee.
His future presidential hopes were likely crushed by Mau-
rice Clemmons, who allegedly shot and killed four police of-
ficers in Lakewood, Wash., on Sunday. It was revealed that
Huckabee granted clemency to Clemmons some nine years
ago for crimes he committed while in high school. Clemmons
ultimately returned to a life of crime, culminating in Sunday's
brutal shootings. He was shot and killed by police after evad-
ing capture for two days.
For taking the life of the four officers and forever damag-
ing their families, and for ruining many deserving juvenile de-
fendants' chances for clemency, we throw a we-knew-you'd-
get-what-was-coming-to-you-eventually DART at Maurice
Clemmons. The lesson for Huckabee: Compassion doesn't
always pay off.
Thankfully, members of the UF chapter of Habitat for Hu-
manity showed us on Thursday that some good deeds do
go unpunished. The group raised awareness for its cause by
building gingerbread house-style recreations of the Great Wall
of China, Ben Hill Griffin Stadium and, of course, our favorite,
the Reitz Union. We wonder if they had enough materials left
over for the expansion. Were there enough gum drops and ic-
ing cement to complete the renovation?
For raising money for an important cause and getting UF
students involved by any means necessary (sweets never hurt),
we would like to give a you're-as-sweet-as-your-gingerbread-
Reitz-Union LAUREL to UF Habitat for Humanity. Because
no one has ever made asbestos taste this good! The lesson:
Don't give up hope on good deeds.
That's it for this week. Hope you can remember these les-
sons better than the calculus (or biology, English or Man's
Food).

Guest column
Obarma is right to weigh options in war
n a recent interview, Dick Cheney attacked the presi-
dent for "agonizing" over the Afghanistan strategy,
saying: "Every time [Obama] delays, defers, debates,
changes his position, it begins to raise questions: Is the
commander in chief really behind what [the military
has] been asked to do?"
I completely agree with Cheney here.
I am not in favor of doing a thorough investigation of
strategy or the consequences of military options before
sending thousands of soldiers off to war.
I believe all leaders should take the George W. Bush
approach and "shoot from the hip." It doesn't matter if
the opposing country is an actual threat or only a per-
ceived threat. As long as they might be a threat, then we
should go ahead and eliminate them.
Pre-emptive war should be the national policy of the
United States because diplomacy is outdated. In today's
world, what is needed is more bombs.
Our soldiers surely don't want a president who wor-
ries or is genuinely torn about putting them in harm's
way because delay is weakness.
We need a president who sticks to his position and
never thinks twice about whether the path we have cho-
sen is the right one. "Flip-floppers" are not welcome in
this country because real leaders don't need to reflect.
They get it right the first time.
We should trust in them with blind, irrational faith.
This goes double for military leaders. It obviously
doesn't apply to liberals, though, because we all know
that deep down, they aren't nearly as patriotic as good
conservatives.
We need to support our troops. by keeping them
deployed indefinitely. It doesn't matter if there is no
clear definition of victory; we need to keep fighting,
otherwise the terrorists win.
I absolutely agree with Cheney when he said the
previous administration bears no blame for the disin-Nick Miner tegration of Afghanistan. The Af-
ghan strategy of the Cheney-Bush
Spea king Out _administration was not flawed in
any way.
We don't need to worry about how Afghanistan has
become the heroin capital of the world. Or that the num-
ber of U.S. troops has increased by almost 300 percent in
the past two years. Neither of these are an indication of
failed Cheney-Bush policies.
What is needed in the Obama administration is an
increased belief in American exceptionalism: the belief
that the United States is the greatest, freest nation the
world has ever known.
Because we are the best in history, we have the right
-nay, the responsibility -to impose our values and
enforce our will on the rest of the world. After all, inter-
national relations are obviously based upon the strong
dominating the weak.
We have the most powerful military the world has
ever known; why shouldn't the rest of the world do
what we say? And the fact that our most successful mili-
tary engagements came as part of powerful coalitions is
trivial and inconsequential.
World opinion doesn't matter because we are the
United States of America, and as such, we should be
able to do whatever we want, and everyone else should
toe the line we dictate.
The basic foundation of Cheney's point is that the
United States is always an agent for good, and thus we
are always right. People oppose us not because their
best interests diverge from ours, but because they are
evil.
It doesn't matter that our drone strikes kill innocent
people more often then they kill actual terrorists. They
are merely guilty by association.
Or evil by association.

Students also protested 15

Steven Shanik, one of two lead-

Shanik, a UF freshman, said ris-

tures is squeezing some potential
students out of a chance to get a
college education in Florida.
UF raised tuition by 15 percent
this year, the maximum allowed
each year under a new state law
that lets state universities raise tu-
ition until they reach the national
average.
As a result, tuition and fees for
most undergraduates at UF are
now $145.76 per credit hour, up
from $125.91.
Meanwhile, Bright Futures will

UF students could also see their

Jordan, who was standing next

UF RESEARCH
Camera gives closer look at cancer
By GAIA BONINI
Alligator Contributing Writer
A new tool developed by a UF re-
searcher could revolutionize cancer
treatment and allow for much earlier
detection of tumors.
Endoscopes are a common tool
used in the detection of cancer. A cam-
era affixed to a long, thin tube allows
doctors to see abnormal growths on
the surface of internal organs.
Huikai Xie created a "scanning
micro-endoscope" by replacing the
camera with an infrared scanner that
allows a doctor to "see" beneath an or-
gan's surface tissue.
"It's a technology which can see
through tissue, so it can see depths of
information, not just the surface," he
said.
While traditional endoscopes give a
view of an organ's surface tissue, doc-
tors can't see how deep or exactly how
big the growth is, making biopsies in-
exact, unnecessarily random and often
dangerous when performed on vital
organs, Xie said.
Biopsies can cause internal bleed-ing and trauma to organs. They can
also take several days to be processed
by a lab to determine whether the tis-
sue is cancerous or not, leaving a pa-
tient's peace of mind hanging in the
balance.
Once a growth is visible on the sur-
face, Xie said it is likely the rest of the
organ could fail.
Xie's scanner allows doctors to look
beneath the surface
of the tissue before
a cancerous growth
is big enough to be
seen.
Byseeingthrough
the tissue rather than
just its surface, doc-I J tors can also deter-Xie mine the exact size
and margins of a growth, taking the
guesswork out of biopsies and elimi-
nating the chance of over-cutting.
"Our organs are very valuable,"
Xie said. "And today's biopsies are not
a good technique."
Xie's scanners have a resolution
10 times higher than the only other
non-camera based endoscopes avail-able, and one of his scanners can even
produce a 360-degree image of the sur-
rounding tissue.
Eventually, Xie said he hopes to be
able to use his scanners not only in the
detection of cancer cells but also in the
surgical removal of tumors.
He is working to attach a cutting
instrument to his scanners that would
allow doctors to have a real-time view
of areas undergoing surgery. While
currently they rely mostly on still MRI-
and CT-scanned images taken before
the surgery.
This would be most beneficial in
high-risk, precision operations, where
over-cutting could lead to permanent
damage, such as in brain surgery, Xie
said.
If his project gets the funding it
needs to continue in research and re-
ceives all the necessary FDA approv-
als, Xie said he expects his scanning
micro-endoscopes could be on the
medical market in two or three years.
He is already collaborating with
doctors at Shands at UF to perfect his
instruments and said they could be the
first in the field to work with them.

There's a lot at stake this week in
the alligatorSports Brand Picks Column
this week, as the pickers are doing their
final jockeying for the crown and trying
to avoid embarrassment. Only two -
Bobby Callovi and Kyle Maistri -are
still actually picking for glory.
TEXAS WILL COVER THE -13.5 SPREAD
BECAUSE .Kyle's taking Nebraska
for one reason: he has a Nebraska T-
shirt. Now, this isn't just any T-shirt.
No, this one comes with memories
the happiest of Kyle's miserable life.
It hasn't been washed in seven years,
so as to keep the smell from the time
he stood next to a girl for more than a
minute without peeing his pants and
crying. There's a tear on the back from
the time the neighborhood bullies let
him off easyby just hanging him from a
fence by his wedgie. So there you have
it. Kyle has to pick Nebraska, because if
the Huskers lose, he'll lose all hope.
-MIKE McCALL
NEBRASKA WILL COVER THE +13.5
SPREAD BECAUSE .Mike McCall was
born with a silver spoon in his mouth,
and one up his butt, as it turns out.
The universe has to balance itself
out at some point. McCall represents
lucky Texas, which has had every-
thing go its way this season. You and
me, we're Nebraska. The underdog.
We don't live in Ponte Vedra, belong
to a world class country club and
go yachting on the reg. McCall has
had everything go his way his entire
life, and I'm sick of it. Let's see how
he deals with a little adversity for a
change. To McCall, adversity is noth-
ing more than being unable to wear an
undershirt that matches the logo on
his Ralph Lauren Polo shirt because
his mom forgot to do his laundry. It's
time he joined us in the real world.

By ANTHONY CHIANG

Not much has changed in the last two years.
In 2007, Florida swept College of Charleston in
the first round of the NCAA Tournament.
On Thursday the No. 14 Gators (24-5, 16-4
Southeastern Conference) did it again as they dom-
inated the Cougars 3-0 (25-21, 25-17, 25-18) in the
- O'Connell Center to open the postseason.
"There is a different feeling in the
O'Connell Center during the tournament.
It becomes more of a neutral environ-
ment, and I'm not sure we played quite
with the emotion we needed to generate

those things."

But the home-court advantage wasn't quite the
one UF was used to.

Improved conditioning frees up Donovan's coaching
0 FLORIDA WILL PLAY AT
JACKSONVILLE TONIGHT AT 7.
By ADAM BERRY
Alligator Staff Writer
aberry@alligator org
Florida's 6 a.m. workouts and relays
this summer have paid dividends beyond
just improved conditioning.
With his players finally in good enough
shape to endure the physical demands of
practice, UF coach Billy Donovan has been
freed up to prepare his team in a way that
wasn't possible a season ago.
"The last couple years, he was just try-
ing to get guys to play hard. He couldn't
even really teach," senior forward Dan
Werner said. "Now, we're playing at a dif-
ferent level. He can explain stuff to us, we
can figure things out a little better and we
get more shots up every day."
In its matchup with Jacksonville (0-4)
tonight at 7 in Jacksonville Veterans Me-
morial Arena, No. 13 Florida (7-0) will get
another chance to show the strides Dono-
van has been able to make with his team
in practice.
The most noticeable and effective ex-
ample of the Gators' improved condition-
ing so far this season has been their full-
court pressure. Werner said Donovan has
worked on the press in practice more than
he has the last two years, and UF has used
its athleticism and newfound endurance to
help force almost 18 turnovers per gamethis season.
"We ran on offense last year, but we
were not able to pressure the ball like I
would have liked to just because we had
a lack of depth," Donovan said. "You get
better when the defense transitions back
and they don't let the offense score in the
first five seconds."
Due to a combination of injuries and
players who weren't capable of runningthe floor, UF wasn't able to do that kind
of work on the transition game in practice
last year.
Donovan pointed to guard Ray Ship-
man, center Kenny Kadji and former UF
players Eloy Vargas and Allan Chaney as
not being in good enough shape last sea-
son.
Even point guard Erving Walker, who
has recently drawn considerable praise
Andrew Stanfill / Alligator Staff
UF coach Billy Donovan is able to coach a lot more freely after the team's improved
offseason conditioning. Florida plays at Jacksonville tonight.from Donovan for his tireless work at the
front of the press, wasn't ready to do all
his coach needed from him.
As a result, Donovan was lucky if he
could work on transition defense and of-
fense without taking a break -something
the Gators have executed with ease on the
court this year but weren't even capable of
doing in scrimmages last year.
"We had a tough time putting all that
together at the same time," Donovan said.
"We've gotten better, and we can have
more competitive practices because I think
guys are better conditioned."
Unlike last season, Donovan has a full
roster of players who can keep practices
competitive and run the floor, as Walker,
Shipman and the rest of the returning
Gators whipped themselves into shape
over the summer under the supervision of
strength and conditioning coach Matt Her-
ring.
Even this year's freshman class started
in far better condition than the previous
group. Kenny Boynton, Erik Murphy and
Rod Tishman didn't need to be eased into
practice, allowing Donovan to finally fo-
cus on coaching basketball as opposed to
coaching effort.
"I feel like the bottom part of our team
this year is in much better shape to con-
tribute to make practice more competi-
tive," Donovan said. "They understand
now the commitment that they need to
make physically to be in that type of shape
to play that way."
MCCALL, from page 17
us a real disservice with his com-
ments this week that he likes the
current system.
We need him to be jilted, angry
and on our side.
* Root for No. 5 Cincinnati (at
No. 15 Pittsburgh, Big East Cham-pionship).
The Bearcats are a key compo-
nent here, too.
If they go undefeated through
a BCS conference and get shut
out, they'll raise quite a stink.
And can you imagine all that
complaining with a Midwestern
accent?
That's enough to break downeven the most cold-hearted BCS
exec.
*Pull for No. 6 Boise State
(vs. New Mexico State). Yeah,
the Broncos probably don't need
your help, but we need them un-
defeated.
With a Cincinnati win, it
should be a safe bet that Boisewould be selected to a BCS bowl,
making this the first year with
two at-large teams from non-BCS
conferences.
That's a step in the right direc-
tion.
I know that rooting for under-
dogs to get screwed feels dirty.
And I have to admit, if the starsever align and East Carolina is in-
volved, I'll totally go against what
I'm advocating right now.
But my goal here isn't for a
small school to win a title I don't
really believe in anyway.
I want a playoff, a true cham-
pion, and for now, the best way of
getting there is to create the big-
gest mess possible every year.

Florida will face FIU in NCAA second round
VOLLEY, from page 17
show and all of those things."
However, the Gators still showed no post-
season nerves as they stormed out to an early
5-1 lead.
They never trailed in the first set thanks
to the play of sophomores Kristy Jaeckel and
Colleen Ward, who each had five kills each in
the opening frame.
"There was only one ball where (Ward) hit
out of bounds when I thought she made a bad
decision," Wise said.
"When we started this season, we would
have been thrilled if it was one per game, and
so what we are seeing is the maturing process
of Colleen as a hitter."
Ward finished with 14 kills to help lead
the team to a .476 hitting effi-
ciency, the highest percentage
the Gators have ever hit in the
NCAA Tournament.
Volleyball "I thought our passing was
great tonight, and it allowed
us to get the ball to a bunch
of different people," sophomore setter Kelly
Murphy said.
"We just stayed patient and made really
smart decisions with our hitting."
Wise decided to use the one-setter offense
Thursday, which worked successfully again.
Murphy dished out 31 assists and kept the
defense off balance with seven kills.
College of Charleston's outside hitter Katie
Robinson, who went to Oak Hall High School
in Gainesville, did not enjoy her homecoming
as much as she would have liked.
"I was pretty nervous," Robinson said. "I
knew that a ton of people were going to be
here but I just tried to block that out of my
mind."
She finished with a -.286 hitting efficiency
in the loss to the Gators.
Before UF's match, FIU (32-3) outlastedMiami (18-13) in a five-set thriller 3-2 (25-16,
20-25, 22-25, 27-25, 15-11).
Now the Gators will move on to host the
Golden Panthers in the second round tonight
at 7 p.m.
"FIU is a really tough matchup for us,"
Wise said. "I think they will be one of the best
second-round opponents we have ever faced
at home."

Now, on to the picks!
In first with a record of 67-62 is Bobby "Don't put that in your mouth"
Callovi, who is packing his shoes full of Play-Doh out of fear he won't meet
the height requirement to ride MARTA this weekend.
Also in first and a victim of alphabetical order at 67-62 is Kyle "Tiger
made the right choice" Maistri, who'd gladly ram his Crown Vic into a fire
hydrant to spend a night with either of Tiger Woods' side dishes.
In third with his head just below water at 64-65 is the Tampa Tribune's
Mike "What do you think, Christmas Pez Bear?" DiFerdinando, who placed
his newest little friend on his desk in class. Not that little friend .
Next, at 63-66 is the Gainesville Sun's Ed "Not now chief, I'm in the zone"
Aschoff, whose three-hour flex session caused him to get his picks in late.
Tied with Ed is Mike "You guys wouldn't know a fun Thursday night if it
bit you in the butt" McCall, who thinks tipping cows with his buddies from
Ag. school in Tifton is worth leaving Gainesville 12 hours earlier.
In sixth at 57-72 is the Miami Herald's Joe "The first rule of Carlos Dun-
lap is, you do not talk about Carlos Dunlap" Goodman, who woke up with
a dead horse's head in his sheets. That's what you get for asking questions
UF's media relations department doesn't want you to ask.
Next, at 56-73 is the Florida Times Union's Mike "What does insensitive
mean?" DiRocco, who once described a look of shock as, "She looked like
she just walked out of the Twin Towers."
Settling nicely into eighth at 55-74 is the Palm Beach Post's Ben "I couldn't
outmuscle a hoard of tween girls to get close enough to touch Tebow on his
last Gator Walk" Volin, who will be returning to his old stomping grounds
in Atlanta this week. Too bad his old friends won't recognize him beneath all
the orange-and-blue paint and eye-black strips.
In ninth at 54-75 is the Orlando Sentinel's Jeremy "Just give me the favor-
ites" Fowler, who has done so poorly lately that he decided he has a better
chance of not finishing last by not picking games at all.
In last with a record of 53-76 is Phil "Charlie Weis" Kegler, who plans on
ducking the media after he finishes the season in last place. Grow up, Kegs.

Healed Howell gives depth in IMs
* THE SOPHOMORE
RETURNED TO COMPETITION
TWO WEEKS AGO.
By TONI-ANN MILLER
Alligator Writer
After suffering an injury early
this season, Florida sophomore Bri-
an Howell returned to competition
in November and has made the best
of his opportunity since.
Howell broke his hand while
hanging out with his teammates
after practice and was confined to
a splint for three weeks, unable to
swim.
In his first tournament back, the
South Carolina Invitational two
weeks ago, Howell showed he had
the potential to be one of UF's elite
individual medley swimmers.
He was fourth in the men's 200-
yard IM and second in the 400 IM.
Howell said his performance in
that first meet was close to what he
expected after not competing in the
earlier meets this season.
"The amount of training that I'd
done and that being my first real
competition of the year, I can't say
I was disappointed," Howell said. "Iwould've liked to swim faster, but it
was a good starting point."
On a team loaded with talented
athletes, Howell has managed to
put himself in the mix with the more
recognized names.
He swam the sixth-fastest time
(1:52.99) for UF this season in the
200 backstroke, and he owns the
fifth-fastest time (1:51.41) this year
in the 200 IM.
"There's definitely a lot of
pressure here because the
team is so good. If you don't
step up there's someone
else right behind you who'll
step up and do the job just
as (well) or better than you
could."
Brian Howell
UF sophomore swimmer
His most notable time this fall
came in the 400 IM, back in South
Carolina, where he swam a 3:56.21,
placing him behind junior Conor
Dwyer for the second-fastest time in
the event.
The sophomore said he has dealt
with the pressure of swimming forone of the nation's top programs,
and the depth of the team is a driv-
ing factor for the team's improve-
ment.
"There's definitely a lot of pres-
sure here because the team is so
good," Howell said. "If you don't
step up, there's someone else right
behind you who'll step up and do
the job just as (well) or better than
you could.
"A spot is never guaranteed, and
that's why everyone keeps getting
better."
When UF's fourth-ranked men
and fifth-ranked women compete
in the Georgia Invitational today
through Sunday, Howell said he'll
be looking to get more race experi-
ence, but coach Gregg Troy will be
looking to the sophomore to see just
what he can do.
This is UF's last meet until Janu-
ary.
"He's one of the guys we're es-
pecially going to watch this week-
end because he's got some good
talent," Troy said. "He didn't get to
race quite as often as we would like
this fall, but he did do a good job of
recovering and staying on track, so
he's one that we really want to see
some more racing from."Lb

UF swimming coach Gregg Troy is excited to see what sopho-
more Brian Howell can do now that he's back from injury.
Tebow, UF's offense will dictate whether Gators return
T his one is on the offense.For 12 games, Florida's defense has
dominated. The Gators have suffocated
top-notch run games, stifled quality passing
attacks and had a knack for big plays in big
moments.
The unit deserves a helping hand Saturday
against Alabama in the SEC Championship
Game.
During that same stretch, UF's offense has
been almost entirely underwhelming. Sure,
there were 40-point outbursts against Ken-
tucky and Georgia, and yes, Florida State's
defense made everything look A-OK.
Maybe it is, or maybe it's not. Honestly,
I've been waiting for Saturday to see just how
much the offense has grown during the year.
It's hard to judge a unit when it can literally do
next to nothing and win because of an out-of-this-world defense and a great punter.
The numbers have gotten better, but is that
a true sign of development? I'm just not so
sure.
It'd be ludicrous for me to suggest the of-
fense is going to carry the defense Saturday.
That simply won't happen. A terrible game by
the defense would result in a loss to Alabama
nearly 100 percent of the time.
Thankfully for the Gators, the odds of
that happening are close to zero. But Charlie
Strong's defense might not be able to give UF
the overwhelming advantage it has all season.
This SEC Championship Game is going to
feature two great defenses going against one
another, with the loser being the first one to
blink. It's a near-guarantee that Florida's de-
fense will come ready to play, but Tim Tebow
is going to have to lead his team down thefield for a few iconic
drives just like last year
if the Gators are going
to win.
Fewhavementioned
this week that Percy
Phil Kegler Harvin didn't play in
Phil on the Hill this game a year ago, so
pkegler@a lligator org offensively, UF is only
down Louis Murphy.
Riley Cooper caught
the game-clinching touchdown an inch off the
ground last year in Atlanta. Jeff Demps scored
the go-ahead touchdown early in the fourth
quarter on a 1-yard run.
Demps and Chris Rainey have to be bigger
factors this year. Rainey was hurt last time,
and Demps finished with 53 yards on 14 car-
ries, an average of 3.8 yards per carry.to BCS title game
Aaron Hernandez will have to continue to
be a playmaker. Alabama allowed a few dev-
astating shovel passes to Hernandez last year.
I wouldn't expect that to happen again, but
Tebow will need Hernandez to get free down
the field.
Of course, no discussion of the offense is
complete without mentioning Tebow. He led
two fourth-quarter drives to win last year, and
those 15 minutes of football are still mentioned
often. He will probably have to pull some kind
of heroics again.
Then again, I learned long ago not to doubt
Tebow. He gave the world his promise, and
22 games later, he still hasn't walked off the
field a loser.
For him to keep that going Saturday, it will
have to be his offense that makes the differ-
ence.

The previous three teams that won the national
championship finished the season with at least one
loss.
Neither No. 1 Florida nor No. 2 Alabama can af-
ford to suffer its first loss of the season Saturday
and still expect to play in the BCS National Cham-
pionship Game.
With the winner heading to Pasadena, Calif., to
play for the national title, Saturday's Southeastern
Conference Championship Game in Atlanta will
have the feel of a national championship semifinal.
The Gators and Crimson Tide are No. 1 and No.
2 in the BCS rankings and were ranked first and
fifth, respectively, in the preseason AP poll.
UF coach Urban Meyer has already been to two
SEC Championship Games and two BCS National
Championship Games as a Gator, but he said he
couldn't think of a bigger game that he has been a
part of than the upcoming one.
"Now that we're here, I can feel (the national
championship-like atmosphere)," Meyer said.
"People were trying to make it that type of game
back in September. I think if I remember right, both
teams were picked to make it to the championship
game.",
The matchup was set after Alabama's 24-15 vic-
tory over LSU on Nov. 7, but the talk of a rematch
of last year's SEC Championship Game started
soon after the last one finished.
Both teams had key players depart after last sea-
son, mostly on the offensive side of the ball.
Florida lost the services of wide receivers Percy
Harvin and Louis Murphy, and Alabama no longer
has quarterback John Parker Wilson, running back
Glen Coffee or left tackle Andre Smith. The Gators
returned all of their starters on defense, and the
Crimson Tide brought back nine of their 11 before
losing star linebacker Dont'a Hightower to a knee
injury early this year.
The experience of the defenses has been obvi-
ous as both units have dominated opposing teams

Alabama's and Florida's defenses are ranked in
the top eight in the nation in total, scoring, rushing
and passing defense.
The most points either team let up in a game was
the 24 Alabama allowed Virginia Tech to score, and
the most UF has given up was 20 to Arkansas.
The two units have different styles of play, but
they still share certain traits of a great defense.
"There's a lot of similarities, both great defens-
es. There are similarities with our defense. A lot of
team speed," quarterback Tim Tebow said. "They
run for the ball, make big plays."
Despite finishing the regular season undefeated,
neither team's season was without drama.
Alabama trailed heading into the fourth quarter
in three games this season and was leading by no
more than seven points when the last quarter be-
gan in two other games, including a 12-10 win over
Tennessee that needed two blocked
field-goal attempts by nose guard
Terrence Cody.
Florida never entered the fourth
Football quarter trailing in any game this
season, but four games were within
a touchdown at the start of the final
period, including a 23-20 win over Arkansas that
required a 27-yard field goal by Caleb Sturgis.
The Gators also dealt with a new off-the-field
storyline almost every week and have another one
this week with the recent arrest and suspension of
starting defensive end Carlos Dunlap.
Junior cornerback Joe Haden said the goal was
not to go undefeated but to get to the SEC Cham-
pionship Game because Meyer did not want the
team to feel like the season was a failure if they
lost a game early on. While both teams' goal was
not to finish undefeated but win a championship,
they will now have to finish without a blemish to
accomplish that aspiration.
"If you lose a game, then was the season a fail-
ure? He didn't want that to be the case," Haden
said. "Now we're sitting here undefeated. SEC
Championship, we win this, we go on to the na-
tional championship."
