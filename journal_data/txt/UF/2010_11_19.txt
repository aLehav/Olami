◗ The Gators will         
celebrate Senior Day 
and try to end their 
three-game losing streak in The Swamp at 
12:30 p.m. on Saturday 
against Appalachian State.
Going Down
SwingingFor three years, wins were easy to come 
by . 
Florida’s 2010 senior class lost two 
games in two seasons after a rocky 2007 season that ended with a 9-4 record and a Capitol One Bowl loss. 
Add in the redshirt seniors that will be hon-
ored on Florida Field before Saturday’s 12:30 p.m. game with Appalachian State on Senior Day , and the class of 23 has won two BCS National Championships, two Southeastern Conference titles and a Sugar Bowl.
It doesn’t seem fitting that such a successful 
class will finish its time at UF amid the worst season in coach Urban Meyer’s tenure. 
The Gators slipped out of the top 25 for the 
first time since Meyer took over six years ago. The senior class lost as many regular season 
games this season as it did in the previous three 
combined. 
And Gators fans have watched three con-
secutive losses in The Swamp with three former 
UF coaches on the opposing sidelines — Billy 
Gonzales, Dan Mullen and Steve Spurrier. 
All that’s left is a chance to play for pride 
and finish the season  on a high note.
That all starts with a win against FCS title-
contender Appalachian State, something that quarterback John Brantley wouldn’t guarantee  this week. 
For such a proud and decorated class, what 
used to be a sure thing — winning — is now an every-week struggle no matter the opponent. 
“It will obviously be an emotional day this 
weekend. It’s tough for me because I feel like I gave it my all for this program,” senior Mike Pouncey said. 
“It just sucks ending on a note like this, but I 
just want to finish the season out strong with a 
couple more wins.”
Losing talent
Five forgone Senior Days will cast a long 
shadow over Ben Hill Griffin Stadium from five 
NFL cities this weekend. 
Florida’s senior class is not devoid of talent 
with players like Ahmad Black, Chas Henry 
and Pouncey set to run out of the tunnel for the 
final time.
But who knows what could have been if even 
a few of the juniors from a season ago wouldn’t 
have traded in Gainesville for Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, New England and 
Chicago. 
Joe Haden, Maurkice Pouncey , Carlos 
Dunlap, Aaron Hernandez and Major Wright 
were all key contributors to this class’ success. 
Only Hernandez, last season’s leading pass-catcher, wasn’t a three-year starter out of the 
group. 
“I said that about a lot of players. You kind of 
wish that you had energy-givers on your team, people that you want to be around,” Pouncey 
said.
This week, Meyer pointed to a lack of energy 
as one of the team’s biggest problems this sea-son but went to bat for his senior class, which 
has helped bring him so many wins. 
But even he made sure to include the five 
that left when breaking down the class and 
their accomplishments.
“There’s a bunch of Gator greats and a 
bunch of guys we’re awful proud that they came to Florida and we want to send them out winners,” Meyer said. 
Losing chemistry
When the 2007 class came in, it meshed 
immediately with the legendary 2006 group that included Tim Tebow, Percy Harvin and 
Brandon Spikes. 
By their sophomore seasons, 13 of the start-
ers in the 2008 BCS National Championship 
Game were members of those two classes. 
A few veterans contributed to Florida’s suc-
cess early in their careers, but the talented ones 
played right away and became the identity of the team — an opportunity that was not af-
forded to the highly touted recruiting class that 
came in this season. 
Now veterans, several seniors expressed 
regret in failing to form relationships with this 
season’s young players. 
“We’re a very talented team on both sides 
of the ball. I wish camaraderie would’ve come 
a whole lot sooner,” senior linebacker Brandon 
Hicks said.
The players say they have come together 
lately and formed a stronger bond, but a divi-
sion between the seniors and freshmen perme-
ated through much of the season. 
Few freshmen made an impact this year, 
despite their No. 2 ranking as a recruiting class 
by Rivals.com and the team’s obvious need for playmakers on both sides of the ball. 
“Everyone says the first year is used to get 
adjusted to college and the speed and every-thing. ... We needed it to happen very fast for 
the younger guys,” Hicks said. 
“(Defensive end) Ronald Powell is coming 
along fast, but we needed more guys to step up 
and play . It was challenging. It didn’t happen as fast as we wanted to, but it did happen.” 
Losing The Swamp
Florida lost three in a row at home for the 
first time since 1986, and suffered its worst home loss since 2002 in a 36-14 defeat to South Carolina. 
Prior to this season, UF lost two games at 
home in the previous four seasons, dating back to Meyer’s first national championship team in 
2006. 
“I think the toughest part [of the season] is 
losing at home because our fan base has been amazing in my four-year career here,” Pouncey 
said. “It just sucks sending them out like that, 
and I know it’s hard on us for going out like that. I think that’s the toughest part is just losing at home, especially for all the fans who stuck 
behind us through the good and the bad.”
If Appalachian State pulls off an upset this 
weekend, the bad from this season will cloud the good from one of the best classes in recent 
UF history . 
But with three games left, including a bowl 
game, the seniors have a chance to remind peo-ple just how good they have been. 
“The thing that would make me most proud 
is just finish,” Black said. “As much as we’ve 
been up and down — people were throwing 
darts at us at the early part of the season, we 
got back on people’s good side and now they’re throwing darts at us again. I just want to make 
sure everybody finishes.”Editor Anthony Chiang    ◗  Cover Photo Harrison Diamond

OUTQUESTIONABLE� THE DUO COMBINED FOR 23 
RUSHING YARDS AND FOUR COMPLETIONS AGAINST SOUTH CAROLINA.
By ANTHONY CHIANG
Alligator Staff Writer
achiang@alligator.org
 
The three-man quarterback rota-
tion received a lot of hype heading 
into the South Carolina game, but it 
didn’t live up to expectations.
Freshmen Jordan Reed and Trey 
Burton combined for only 23 rushing 
yards on nine carries and completed four passes against the Gamecocks. 
Instead, starter John Brantley stayed 
in for most of the game and threw 31 times.
Coach Urban Meyer said he pan-
icked when the Gators fell behind early and ignored the game plan to get all three players involved. But Meyer is making sure not to make the same mistake against Appala-
chian State on Saturday.
On Thursday, he said he ex-pects Burton and Reed to be more 
involved in the offense this week. 
However, the pace of the game will 
dictate those plans.
“A lot of it is based on flow,” 
Meyer said. “But we script a few series and we get those guys in the game. A lot of it is how they are playing and how we are moving the ball.”
Injuries: Same thing, different 
week for running back Jeff Demps.
Demps (foot) will be available to play Saturday, but he will be limit-ed. The junior has played sparingly 
since he was injured against Ten-
nessee on Sept. 18. Demps has car -
ried the ball 16 times in the last five games.
“He’s out there, but he’s not prac-
ticing,” Meyer said. 
“He hasn’t practiced in the last 
six or seven weeks. I mean he kind of goes through the motions because 
he’s a tough kid. But Jeff Demps is 
one of those guys that goes 40 yards every time he touches the ball — devastating.”
Defensive tackle Jaye Howard 
will also play against Appalachian State.However, linebacker A.J. Jones will miss the home finale with a hamstring injury. 
Meyer to return next season: On 
Monday, Meyer said he could not guarantee his return as UF’s coach next season.
But he clarified those comments 
Thursday, when he said nothing will get in the way of his return. He put the possibility of coaching the Gators for a seventh season at 100 
percent.Reed, Burton expected to play more

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) — 
Soldiers accused of breaking into a Colorado 
medical marijuana dispensary and then acci-dentally locking themselves inside told police they planned to destroy the marijuana — not smoke or sell it.
The Gazette in Colorado Springs reports a 
police affidavit says two of the three Fort Car -
son soldiers told officers they were trying to steal the marijuana so they could get rid of it.
Police say the three were arrested Satur -day on second-degree burglary charges after they accidentally locked themselves in the Colorado Springs dispensary during a bur -
glary attempt.
Officers say they were on an unrelated call 
at a nearby business around 2 a.m. when they heard someone banging on glass inside the dispensary . The soldiers are 23-year-old Pfc. Darius Thomas, 22-year-old Pvt. Cory Young and 22-year-old Pfc. Ramone Hollins. It was unknown Thursday if any had an attorney.

At the monthly Faculty Senate meeting 
Thursday, faculty senators discussed a pro-
posal to not hold classes on the Wednesday 
before Thanksgiving in future years. This proposal, which will be voted on next month, would be implemented in fall of 2012.
David Groisser, a math professor at UF, 
did not think the proposed change to the cal-ender is a good idea. 
“It sends a signal that education is not as 
important as we say it is,” he said. “It’s 180 degrees in the wrong direction.”
He proposed that the calender stay the 
way it is and leave the option of canceling 
class up to the discretion of the teacher. 
UF Provost Joe Glover also explained 
some of the intricacies of the block tuition 
proposal and how it would affect students.“Block tuition will serve as incentive for 
students to make swifter progress towards graduation,” he said.
He explained that students who want to 
take extra credits sometimes don’t because 
they are worried about how much it will 
cost them.

 CAREER BLISS RANKED UF 
AT NO. 7.
By CRISTINA RABAZA
Alligator Contributing Writer
Football fans aren’t the only ones 
saying it’s great to be a Florida Gator. 
The old adage also rings true for the 
university’s employees.
UF was ranked seventh on CareerB-
liss’ list of top 10 universities with the happiest employees.
CareerBliss surveys employees 
from corporations to guide both em-
ployers and employees in the job selec-
tion process.
UF professors, administrators and 
other staff members rated their work-place on a five-point scale based on 
eight factors: benefits, career advance-
ment, compensation, growth opportu-nity, job security, senior management, work-life balance and their willingness 
to recommend the workplace to others 
seeking jobs, according to a press re-lease.
UF averaged an overall score of 
3.887 out of 5, right behind Columbia 
University’s score of 3.893. Wichita 
State University ranked first with a 
score of 4.290.
The study reported that UF employ-
ees rated their workplace exceptional-
ly high when it came to work-life bal-ance. They felt the university did well 
at providing job security and growth 
opportunities 
for its staff, as well as allowing 
enough time for 
faculty and staff to spend with family.
“I’ve worked at four different insti-
tutions since 1953, and I will say the University of Florida is the top of all of 
them,” said Glenn Butler, an academic adviser and retired professor emeri-tus who began teaching at UF in 1966. 
“They do an excellent job at giving us 
time for work and family. I have two adult children and five grandchildren in the area, and I get to see them eve-nings and weekends, as well.”UF employees happier

Gainesville Commissioners allocated about $100,000 to 
46 nonprofit organizations and passed a resolution to sup-
port the DREAM Act at a meeting Thursday.
Each non-profit organization will receive up to $2,500.
Sister Hazel, director of home and foreign missions at 
Williams Temple Church of God in Christ, was awarded 
$2,500 to give out free dinners. She said people often ask her for meals when the St. Fran-
cis House, a soup kitchen and shelter, reaches the 130-meal 
limit set by the city. 
She said she will use the money to buy a van to transport 
food.“I feed anybody, anywhere,” Hazel, 85, said. She also wants to transport people to clinics. She said 
people sometimes tell her they want to get tested for HIV , 
but only if she drives them. Now, she said, she’ll be able to.
The commission also passed a resolution to support the 
DREAM Act. If passed in Congress, the act would allow chil-
dren of illegal immigrants to become citizens if they attend 
college or serve in the U.S. military.Commission votes to fund nonprofits, support DREAMSEE FACULTY, p AGE 11

� SOME GROUPS ARE TURNING TO 
CHEAPER ALTERNATIVES TO TURKEY.
By MEREDITH RUTLAND
Alligator Contributing Writer
A Gainesville church wants to help put a 
turkey on every table this Thanksgiving.
Donations are low this holiday season, but 
Trinity United Methodist Church will still dis-
tribute about 1,300 Thanksgiving baskets full 
of holiday foods, such as stuffing, mashed po-
tatoes and a turkey for every family.
The goal might not be met, though. Food banks in the area have received few-er donations than before, and needy families may have to rely on smaller organizations.
Turkey donations are the lowest in a de-
cade for the Bread of the Mighty Food Bank, 325 NW 10th Ave., and donations in gen-eral were lower than last year, Director Anne Voyles said. Some people are content just to take a stocking of gifts at Christmas, but on Thanksgiving they’re hoping for meals. 
Despite the high demand and low dona-
tions, the food bank give everyone food, just not necessarily the iconic Thanksgiving meal, 
she said. The food bank can give families din-
ners of chicken, but it needs more donations of stuffing and cranberry sauce.
“There will be meat,” she said. “But they might not have a turkey.”
Distribution of food boxes from Trinity 
United Methodist Church will begin Sunday 
and will end Tuesday . About 500 volunteers, 
church members and Gainesville residents helped pack the boxes.
Horne said there is an outpouring of ap-
preciation from recipients. They often thank her profusely and then call the church later to thank her again and send cards.
“It’s overwhelming,” she said.
She said she hopes the donations will show 
compassion for people who might not often 
feel that comfort.
“The community does care about them.”Voyles said that people feel ashamed when 
they can’t afford a nice meal but their neigh-bors can — it can damage self-esteem.
“If that’s where you are, it’s hurtful,” she 
said.
She encourages members of the commu-
nity to donate items that are buy one, get one free. She also said she wishes more people would donate fresh fruit and vegetables.
“Most of these kids have never tasted a 
pear,” she said.
She said Thanksgiving donations should 
be given by Monday, but any donations re-ceived after will go toward the Christmas season.
“It’s still a very needy time,” she said. Local charity groups fight lack of holiday donations

� PRIVACY IS A CONCERN.
By JORDAN PETERS 
Alligator Contributing Writer
Mark Zuckerberg insists “it’s 
not e-mail.” Bloggers are throwing 
around phrases like “Gmail killer.” One headline  in The Times of India asks, “Will Facebook sound death 
knell for e-mail?”
The site’s new messaging system 
promises to be a radical step for so-
cial networking, but the move has caused concern and criticism among college students and professors. 
The messaging system, which 
was announced Monday, will inte-grate e-mail, SMS text messaging, 
instant messaging and Facebook 
messages. By seamlessly integrat-ing various forms of electronic com-munication within the Facebook interface, the service looks to widen the impact of social networking and compete with services like Yahoo and Gmail. 
Gerald Haskins, a senior lecturer 
in UF’s computer science depart-ment specializing in ethics, said he is concerned about privacy issues.
“The idea of integrating all these 
things is particularly frightening, but it was bound to happen,” he said. 
Combining different forms of 
messaging makes users more vul-nerable to data mining, a practice which has made Facebook the target of controversy in the past, Haskins said. Data mining refers to the prac-tice of analyzing user information from the website to extract patterns from the data.
Haskins believes that by concen-
trating more forms of communica-tion into one, especially a service 
with a history of privacy breaches, 
users would be sacrificing more of their privacy and letting personal in-formation be collected, with little-to-no control over who has access.
“We have basically given away 
privacy ,” Haskins said. 
Haskins said students would be 
particularly at risk for data mining 
because they use Facebook heavily 
and tend to be careless about content that they post. The new system, de-signed to be informal and compre-hensive, would only increase risk. 
Facebook, which currently has 
more than 500 million users, has in-
sisted in the past that it does not sell user infor -
mation to third parties and that it respects the 
privacy of its users. Legally, it is pro-tected by the fact that information is voluntarily shared by users. 
Priscilla De La Torre, a computer 
science senior, said she probably won’t use the service because she prefers a more formal medium and   
separate services for professional 
or social communication. She also raised concerns about the amount of data Facebook would be able to col-lect by permanently storing private text messages and emails. 
“I’m very uncomfortable with 
the idea of one centralized service,” she said.Facebook messaging

Palin family as dangerous as cave of bears
As I fought off those November blues, I decided to 
channel surf through the limited cable my apartment complex provides. 
I flipped past Paula Dean having her own Butter Fest, ba-
bies being abused on “16 and Pregnant” and halted at the 
sight of Bristol Palin in a sequined dress. 
At first I thought it was a Saturday Night Live skit, but 
the ABC logo and the lack of humor in her dancing routing 
made me realize otherwise. 
A quick Google search affirmed my fear, I was watching 
“Dancing with the Stars.” 
I never understood the fascination with watching pseudo-
celebrities dance. 
Half of the talent on the show appeared in TV shows and 
movies in a much earlier decade and therefore are rendered unrecognizable to my generation. 
The other half are retired athletes who, again, become un-
recognizable to younger viewers.
Bristol, however, is neither a retired athlete nor a forgot-
ten actor, so her appearance on “Dancing with the Stars” was both unnecessary and confusing. 
Bristol, whose mother is ex-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, be-
came famous during her mother’s campaign as the Republi-
can Party’s vice-presidential nominee. 
Her baby with ex-Playboy model Levi Johnston was also 
much-publicized. 
As if that wasn’t enough, Google also informed me there 
was a show on The Learning Channel — you know the wed-
ding/multiple-children/pregnancy channel — called “Sarah Palin’s Alaska.” I couldn’t help but laugh out loud as I read the commentary for this television show.
The fact this dysfunctional family was getting so much 
attention seemed odd, yet mildly entertaining.
It seems Sarah Palin is on the brink of deciding whether or 
not she should run for the 2012 presidency. 
Perhaps the publicity from “Dancing with the Stars” and 
“Sarah Palin’s Alaska” is intended to thrust the Palins back into the spotlight and American relevance. 
Either way , I would love to 
see her return in 2012 for another round of lucid interviews and un-realistic expectations. If she is, in-deed, telling the truth, she told the New York Times she is consulting both her family and her politi-cal colleagues on her decision on 
whether to rock the boat and challenge Obama. 
Although some, including some of her own Republican 
colleagues, consider her unelectable, she still might carry on and decide to run for the highest office in the land. 
Maybe this time around her other daughter Willow, who 
has been in the limelight lately for some choice anti-gay slurs when one of her Facebook friends dissed her mother and sister, will be expecting a baby and subsequently appear on “Dancing with the Stars.” I can only hope.
Seeing the Palins on national television once again is a 
scary thought. 
If millions of Americans are tuning in to these television 
shows, then millions are also thinking about Sarah Palin’s political future. 
Ultimately , having Sarah Palin as a political candidate 
would be highly entertaining, but the thought of having her actually serve as any sort of power politician is a much scarier one.
Just like she exercised caution when approaching a group 
of brown bears in her TLC show, we should do the same when approaching her. 
Yes, she and her family  can be entertaining, but they are 
as dangerous as a maverick brown bear, so exercise the same caution when approaching.

science student at Santa Fe College. His column appears every Friday.We don’t even know where to start with the crazy this 
week, Gators. There’s so much to talk about with you, but 
we have so little time. 
First, we had the guy in Kentucky who forced another 
guy to eat his beard. There is have the man in Wisconsin who shot his own TV after apparently becoming so en-raged Brandy was booted from “Dancing With The Stars” instead of Bristol Palin. 
And speaking of the Palins, Sarah Palin’s own TV show 
premiered this week, which only makes for good laughter at the thought of a presidential contender having her own TV show on The Learning Channel. Although we most 
definitely can learn how to skin a bear and keep women 
from having abortions from the Palins, let’s hope our fu-ture foreign relations don’t involve sitting on a porch and viewing Russia with binoculars.

And to keep the crazy momentum going, let’s visit San 
Diego for a bit. 
When we last left you, John Tyner, a 31-year-old Cali-
fornia man, was known to nobody except those close to him. 
But after Saturday, Tyner has become the poster child 
with a silver tongue for the opposition to the Orwellian 
evolution of airport security. 
With his refusal to undergo a virtual strip search and a 
refusal to be “sexually assaulted” by a pat down from air -
port officials, Tyner let loose the soon-to-be-iconic phrase, 
“If you touch my junk, I’ll have you arrested.”
And for speaking his mind, for letting the govern-
ment know enough is enough and for sticking it to Big Brother while his fellow Americans bend over backward while the clock strikes 13, the Department of Darts and 
Laurels would like to give Tyner a We’re-Not-Touching-
Your-Junk-Either LAUREL for igniting the flame against 
obtrusive “security.”
Speaking of standing up for what’s right in the face 
of great opposition, we’ve never been happier to throw a huge laurel to a 14-year-old teenager with the audacity 
and valiance of a grown man. 
Graeme Taylor, an openly gay young teenager spoke to 
his school board, pleading for immediate reinstatement of 
Jay McDowell, a teacher who was suspended for telling a 
student making anti-gay remarks to get out his class. 
For acknowledging the injustices in punishing the per -
secuted and not the persecutor, we’re throwing a We’re-Only-Saddened-It-Took-A-14-Year-Old-Boy-To-Awaken-

And then we have Fox News. Never letting up with 
its stream of endless fodder for other media to laugh at, 
Fox News criticized Obama for including Sitting Bull in 
his children’s book released this week because the Lakota 
holy man “killed a U.S. general.”

Block tuition disproportionately affects 
single moms
I got pregnant with my first child at 18 and 
my second at 20. I’m now a single mom of 
two and a full-time student. From the start, I’ve refused to become just another unfortu-nate teen mom statistic. 
So far, UF has done nothing but make that 
a steep uphill battle every step of the way. The proposed block tuition is yet another ob-stacle it has put in my path.
To put it in perspective for my childless 
peers, daycare for two costs about $275 per week. 
I spend more on daycare than on all oth-
er expenses combined, including tuition. I 
have a hard enough time making ends meet 
and putting food on the table without being charged an additional $500 per semester for classes I’m not taking, and that’s before the planned 15 percent tuition increase. As it is, I only have a couple hours a day with my kids; taking the additional class that block tuition would charge me for would leave us with 
even less time together. 
Almost 80 percent of teen moms end up 
on government assistance.
 Less than 2 percent earn a college degree 
by the age of 30. Block tuition would do noth-
ing but make it even harder to overcome those odds and create a better life for my chil-dren and myself.

Columnist presents a distorted view of 
Meatless Mondays
In reference to Nate Rushing’s Thursday 
column, the cows we eat don’t actually eat 
grass. 
They are fed corn because it is so cheaply 
produced, causing them to form E. coli, which is what leads to the foodborne illnesses that kill about 60 people a year, mainly babies and young children. 
And, while colon, breast and prostate can-
cers, diabetes, obesity and heart disease are significantly more likely to affect  meat eat-
ers, that’s worth the taste of meat too, right? 
And even though vegetarians and vegans can get sufficient amounts of vitamin B-12 from vitamin supplements, I’m glad Rushing used the excuse so no one will have to change his or her lifestyle. 
Even though there are other issues that 
could be alleviated with a vegan diet, like hu-man rights, animal rights and environmental 
issues, I’m glad Rushing focused his argu-
ment on his own well being. The rest of the world can deal with itself. 
Albert Einstein, Leonardo da Vinci, Ben 
Franklin, Steve Jobs, Mort Zuckerman, Rus-
sell Simmons and, recently, Bill Clinton and 
other highly successful people are or were all vegetarian or vegan.
 However, I’m glad Rushing didn’t consid-
er the fact that maybe being vegan is healthy and intelligent. Maybe, just maybe, a vegan diet is good for the planet, alleviates suffer -
ing in both humans and animals and makes positive change in the world. 
I’m glad Rushing doesn’t care about any 
of that.

Columnist apathetic toward research
Nate Rushing, the point of eliminating 
meat one day a week is not strictly or pri-marily health related, although you do make some valid points even if you meant them to sound snarky and to ridicule the vegan/veg-
etarian movement. 
Instead, by consuming less meat as a large 
population, a message is sent to U.S. slaugh-
ter houses and meat markets: Their methods and treatment of animals is disgusting and unacceptable. 
By the tone of your article, I find it likely 
you seem fairly apathetic and almost care-less of the repercussions of consuming large 
amounts of meat and animal products.
I’d suggest maybe next time you should 
educate yourself on the vegetarian movement 
before publishing ill-conceived agenda. 
Even if you personally don’t care, your ar -
ticle does reach others, and it’s unfortunate you aren’t being responsible in your research and what message you’re projecting to oth-ers. 
After glancing over a few other of your 
contributions to the Alligator, including last month’s “US legal system fundamentally flawed,” I’m curious as to why this newspa-per is taking such a chance on a columnist with an inability to properly research his arti-cles and why it is putting itself so vehemently behind someone projecting such a poor im-age. Shame on this paper’s editors.

Meatless Monday movement good for 
UF, world
In his Thursday column, Nate Rushing 
does an excellent job of stating his opinion 
and, frankly, not much else. In his unabashed attempt to denigrate the vegetarian move-ment, a target too often eliciting the scrutiny 
of chest-thumping, ultra-macho, self-aggran-dizing he-men, he overstates the trivial and 
overlooks abundant evidence that runs coun-ter to his agenda. Indeed, he stands so thickly eclipsed by straw men, one need not wonder why his views embody carnivorous myopia. 
Let’s set the record straight for everyone, 
but especially for those who may have been misled by Rushing’s fallacious analysis of the Meatless Monday group.
Though not expressly available in a strict-
ly plant-based diet, vitamin B-12 is widely attainable through simple multivitamins and a slew of fortified eatables, such as breakfast cereals and soy products. 
By no means is meat the be-all-end-all as 
a source of this nutrient, and by no means is B-12 the elusive needle in a haystack that Rushing makes it out to be.
While Rushing emphasizes the truly in-
sightful fact bacteria can spread from, well, just about anything, he omits that slaugh-terhouse-primed livestock are routinely left to wallow in their own fecal matter and that 
their flesh carries high amounts of injected 
antibiotics. But antibiotics in food are prob-ably good, right? Wrong. 
The FDA has admitted they pose “an ur -
gent public health issue” for human consum-ers and has documented the advent of bacte-ria that resist drug treatment as detriment of antibiotic use. 
Not to mention, the near-complete corn 
diet on which modern commercial cows sub-sist makes their stomachs more conducive to E. coli growth and invites the formation of cesspools of acid resistant bacteria. And that’s not the good kind, which Rushing so fervently defends in his column.
What he additionally fails to address 
are the growing diabetes, obesity and heart disease issues responsible for the deaths of 
hundreds of thousands of Americans each 
year. A vegetarian lifestyle is associated with lower rates of all these, in addition to lower body mass indices and longer average life ex-pectancy.
Furthermore, cutting back on meat con-
sumption is a practice of sustainability. Its production costs us vastly greater crop and 
water resources than the equivalent caloric 
value of agricultural produce. With millions 
starving around the world, a meatless diet is not only a nutritional gift to yourself; it’s a favor to those who lack even minimal sus-tenance.
But Meatless Monday is not asking any-
one for an entirely meatless diet. Those in-volved are not here to mutiny your personal freedom, Nate. If Rushing did his research, 
he would know these concerned students 
encourage a healthy, thoughtful and compas-sionate lifestyle for the small price of passing on steak for tofu just one day a week. So stop the fearmongering and fill up your plate, Nate. You just might like it.

Meatless Mondays gives Gators the ethi-
cal nutrition we deserve
Well, I guess the overwhelming number of 
us in support of Meatless Mondays were ex-
pecting  a column like Nate Rushing’s Thurs-
day’s column sooner or later.  
To begin with, a meat-based diet can be ar -
guably extremely unhealthy, unnecessary and 
inefficient, and the benefits from a vegan or 
vegetarian diet can, and for the most part do, 
outweigh those of a meat-based diet. Meatless Monday promotes all the benefits of a vegetar -
ian diet, many of which a large majority of stu-dents were previously unaware.
Just to clarify a few points, the Meatless 
Mondays movement does not say a meat-based  diet is completely unhealthy. The movement is saying a vegetarian diet has more health ben-
efits. Multiple studies have  concluded a veg-
etarian diet can result in a lower body mass index as well as lesser chance of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, various forms of cancer and even Alzheimer’s disease. 
A vegetarian or vegan diet also contains all 
the essential vitamins and minerals needed, including B-12, which can be found in cereals, some vegetables and soy foods.
As for “cutting out the middle man,”  a 
cow’s diet under natural circumstances is grass-based, but in the factory farming condi-tions where your meat is produced, a cow is not fed a  grass-based diet. Instead they find 
the cheapest feed available, which in most 
cases is corn.
Animal agriculture produces more green-
house gases than automobiles and livestock 
farming pollutes the water more than all other 
activities combined.
There are many universities across the 
country that already implement some form of Meatless Monday , including Yale, Columbia, 
Harvard and Johns Hopkins University.  
UF deserves to join these prestigious uni-
versities in this initiative.
It is the goal of the Meatless Monday cam-
paign to bring healthy dietary choices to the 
UF campus while giving students the ethical and sustainable food they deserve.

A group of friends at UF have combined their 
passions for business and hats to create a new com-
pany. 
Four students who wanted to create something 
unique for college students across the country 
founded Brohats in July, co-founder Sam Lifton said. 
The business makes and distributes neon trucker 
hats with different sayings and catchphrases. 
A “bro” is a young man or woman who likes to 
have a good time socializing with different people 
and standing out in a crowd, said Lifton, a sopho-
more sports management major. 
The company markets mainly to college stu-
dents, and the hats cost $10. 
Making money is a bonus and a goal of the busi-
ness, but the founders really wanted to create some-thing they could have fun with, he said.
There are seven different hats, but the company 
wants to create more with different colors and say-
ings, Lifton said. 
The business advertises on the website totalfrat-
move.com and has its own site, brohats.com. The business tried using Google and Facebook adver -
tisements, but decided it was not worth the money 
because people were not seeing them.  
Lifton packages the hats and ships them from the local post office. He said hats have been ordered from people in every state and he wants to have 
representatives at different colleges to market the 
company. 
Ryan Weiss, co-founder, thought creating the 
hats and being a part of a business would be a fun, 
new challenge. After selling the first bulk order, he 
knew the business would be a success, said Weiss, a political science senior. 
The group takes a handful of hats to the stadium 
before each game to sell and advertise for the busi-ness. Weiss said the company sells the most hats be-
fore football games, especially the orange one. Their goal is to make $1,000 every two weeks, and they 
hope to achieve it in the next couple of months. 
Erica Freeman, a first-year exploratory major, 
bought a neon orange Brohat thats says “Frat.” at the first home football game on Sept. 4. She saw her 
friends had them and thought they were fashion-
able, she said. 
“Brohats are saving the world, one hat at a time,” 
Lifton said.8, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2010

Today is the last day to see a Native Ameri-
can art exhibit being shown in the U.S. for the 
first time.
The exhibition, “Most Serene Republics,” is 
part of Art Bash, a UF’s School of Art and Art History annual celebration. It will be held from 
6 p.m. to 9 p.m. at the Fine Arts Complex. 
Edgar Heap of Birds, an artist from the 
Cheyenne tribe, has displayed his contempo-rary native art at the University Gallery since 
Oct. 5, said Wes Kline, chair of the 2010 Art Bash committee. 
“Most Serene Republics” was exhibited 
in 2007 at the V enice Biennale, which is the world’s oldest international venue for con-temporary art.
Heap of Birds helped install the show and 
put it together, said Natalia Silva, a graduate 
assistant. To create an outdoor environment, 
trees were brought into the gallery.
The show portrays how particular nations 
have treated Native American people from an activist perspective, Kline said.
Art Bash is free, and local bands will rotate 
performances every half-hour. 
Students from the Workshop for Art Re-
search and Practice will be exhibiting large animal-like inflatable sculptures in the Fine Arts Complex courtyards, Kline said. Alagar -
to Printmakers Guild, a student organization, 
will demonstrate how to make lithographs.  
According to Rodolfo Rodriguez, a graphic 
design senior, the event will exhibit works from UF students in the departments of 
graphic design, printmaking, digital media, 
photography , drawing, painting, ceramics and 
sculpture.
Vox Graphis, a graphic de-
sign club at UF, will sell posters, 
holiday cards and T-shirts, Ro-
driguez said. Proceeds will go toward the club account for its “Ligature 20” spring event.
The ceramics student organization H.O.T. 
(Handbuilt or Thrown) Clay will also have a sale.   Jorge Perez, a graphic design graduate stu-
dent, will run a campaign with fellow class-
mates to bring awareness to the local commu-
nity . They’ll have a photo booth in Fine Arts C, Room 310, and pictures will be taken of at-
tendees, who will be asked to share what they 
do on a daily basis. 
The goal is to create a database that resem-
bles communities where neighbors know one 
another. 
Participants will be able to access the da-
tabase through Facebook where the pictures will be displayed.
Last year about 600 people participated in 
demonstrations, exhibitions and interactive 
projects at Art Bash.

Students got a little lesson on Is-
raeli international relations Thurs-
day afternoon. 
About 30 students gathered at 
Hillel and listened to firsthand ac-counts of what it’s like to live in the political climate of Israel. 
Gil Hoffman, the chief political 
correspondent for the Jerusalem Post, spoke for about an hour on Israeli-Palestinian relations, Presi-
dent Barack Obama’s performance 
in office and the sanctions against Iran. 
“At a time when public dis-course about the Middle East is so shallow, it was important for me 
to come here where I can speak to 
an informed audience,” Hoffman said.
Hoffman graduated from the 
Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University in Evan-ston, Ill. and previously worked for the Miami Herald.
He was stopping in Gainesville 
to speak before an event in Orlando. 
Hoffman lives in Je-
rusalem and was able 
to give  an insider’s perspective on Israeli conflicts with foreign na-tions, sharing his own stories about living in the country.

Students won’t get cake and ice cream for this birthday 
celebration, but they can expect much more.
Lakeside Residential Complex will host its second an-
nual Culture Clash event Sunday from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. at 
the complex. This year’s theme is a birthday bash in honor of Lakeside’s 10th birthday.
The event combines food, games and performances to 
educate people on international issues and traditions. To incorporate the theme of birthday bash, Culture Clash will 
show guests how their birthdays would be celebrated in 
countries around the world. 
J.R. Miller, director of the event, said his committee has 
been planning since summer. 
“The goal of the event is to create a multicultural festival where people can become more aware of the many cultures at UF,” Miller said.
The lawn space at Lakeside will be transformed into a 
tour of the countries with different booths representing 
various continents. Visitors will be able to sample foods 
at each booth while enjoying performances on the center 
stage.
“We hope to make Culture Clash a yearly tradition at 
UF,” Miller said. “There is no other event like it.”UF to celebrate Lakeside’s birthday with ‘culture clash’Dana Burke / Alligator Staff

Santa Fe student Danzil Longville plays Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood on the Reitz Union 
Colonnade on Thursday afternoon. The games were set up to promote a tournament.
OnCampu sHe said 58 percent of freshmen graduate within four years, 
and block tuition could potentially raise that figure by 12 to 14 
percentage points. 
“This is a system which is in place at many, many major uni-
versities around the country, and the students at those universi-
ties do not even think in terms of paying per credit hour,” he 
said. “They think in terms of paying one fee for the privilege of 
studying at the university.”
The university expects to make an 
additional $5 million in revenue annu-ally from block tuition, but it’s not go-ing to be profit, Glover said. 
Faculty senators also discussed a proposal to not hold class -
es on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving in future years. This 
proposal, which will be voted on next month, would be imple-
mented in fall of 2012.
David Groisser, a math professor at UF, did not think the 
proposed change to the calender is a good idea. 
“It sends a signal that education is not as important as we 
say it is,” he said. “It’s 180 degrees in the wrong direction.”
He proposed that the calender stay the way it is and leave 
the option of canceling class up to the discretion of the teacher.FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 13 12, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2010

Students got a taste of world 
hunger Thursday night.
About 60 people attended the 
UF World Hunger Banquet at 
Hillel, which was put on by the UF 
chapters of Oxfam America and 
the One Campaign in an effort to raise awareness about the unequal distribution of food in the world. 
“This is just to give a small in-
sight to what is really going on in the world,” said Jamie Whalen, president of the UF Oxfam chap-ter. 
“We can’t choose the countries 
we’re born into, we can’t choose the circumstances of where we live, but every person has the same basic human rights of food, water and shelter, and people shouldn’t 
be denied that based on their in-
come level.”
Those who attended were as-
signed cards dividing them into three income levels.
The low-income sat on the floor 
and ate rice and water. The middle-income group was allowed to sit in chairs and  eat rice and beans. The 
high-income group sat at tables 
and ate spaghetti and salad. 
The distribution of seating was 
designed to reflect the actual per -
centages of people who fall within 
these brackets. 
Roughly half the attendees sat 
in low-income. 
“A lot of people are [disillu-
sioned] with helping the interna-
tional community because they 
can’t really see the results because 
it’s so far away, but we can really make an impact here,” Whalen 
said.Hunger event shows

“This is a real issue for real peo-

She said she wants to see the

It was a coincidence that the res-olution passed at the same time the act is catching the nation’s atten-tion, she said, but she also thinks 
the timing is appropriate.

We here at the alligatorSports 
Brand Picks Column wish it was Nov. 27 already.
We know it’s just one week away, 
but we just can’t wait that long for Florida and FSU.
But maybe you can, maybe you’re 
kind of nervous about the Seminoles snapping that streak. So, for just to-day, let’s forget about that game and ponder another interstate rivalry.
We are intrigued by this week’s 
North Carolina-N.C. State matchup. The two schools might not have the same reputation as the two from the Gunshine State, but it means a lot to 
the ACC standings.
We left it to two alligatorSports 
columnists to debate the game.

UF forward Will Yeguete is third on the school list for most rebounds recorded in a 
game by a freshman after grabbing 15 in Thursday’s win. 
 YEGUETE RACKED UP 15 REBOUNDS.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
gluca@alligator.org
 
Will Yeguete could only watch from the sidelines as 
the Gators fell to No. 4 Ohio State on Tuesday.  
Against North Carolina A&T (1-3) he took on a 
slightly more active role. 
The freshman played 23 minutes, scored seven 
points and grabbed a game-high 15 rebounds as the 
No. 9 Gators (2-1) cruised to a 105-55 win Thursday in 
the O’Connell Center. 
“I was fresh because I didn’t play , obviously , so I 
was ready to go,” Yeguete said. “I was really excited about playing today, so that helped a lot.”
Yeguete’s 15 rebounds, nine of which came on the 
offensive end, were just six shy of Eugene McDowell’s freshman record from 1982. 
Yeguete was an energetic presence on the court all 
night, aggressively crashing the boards and diving af-ter loose balls. 
“Anytime I get on the court I bring some energy 
and try to make the team better,” Yeguete said. 
This full-throttle effort made Yeguete the talk of the 
first week of practice, so his rebounding outburst came 
as no surprise to his coaches and teammates. 
Coach Billy Donovan has been praising Yeguete’s 
hustle, physicality and nose for the ball from day one, and the freshman put all of those attributes on display 
Thursday . 
“This is not surprising to me,” Donovan said. “He 
is going to be a terrific player because he is a guy that 
embraces the dirty work, and there’s not a lot of guys that understand the impact that has on winning.”
One of the major factors that cost Florida against 
Ohio State was turnovers, as the team totaled 18 against an OSU squad willing to sit back and play half-
court defense.

ing Walker put together a bounce-back performance against A&T, combining for 12 assists and no  turn-Florida blows out North Carolina A&T
UF BASKETBALL

Alligator Writer
 
After Thursday’s loss to DePaul in the 
semifinals of the Preseason Women’s NIT, 
coach Amanda Butler was furious with a ref-
eree’s call on the game’s deciding play. 
A last-second tip-in by freshman guard 
Kayla Lewis was waved off by referees and DePaul took the victory 74-73 and will ad-vance to play Purdue in the final.
“I’m very, very proud of my team and how 
they responded to adversity there at the end. They won the game. Plain and simple,” But-
ler said. “I couldn’t have asked for anything 
more than what they did.”After leading the entire first half, UF al-
lowed its opponent back into the game with sloppy mistakes down the stretch. Turn-overs (24) were once again a problem for the 
Gators, including a crucial 
shot clock violation with less than a minute to play that gave possession back to the Blue Demons.
DePaul then took the ball 
down the floor but missed on consecutive three-point looks only to come down with both rebounds. With 
the shot clock off, DePaul’s Keisha Hampton received a pass inside and was fouled by cen-ter Azania Stewart. She made the front end 
of a 1-and-1 to put DePaul up by one with six 
seconds left and extend her game-high point total to 19.
Lanita Bartley took the ball off the inbound 
and dribbled coast-to-coast but was fouled near the top of the key with a tenth of a sec-ond on the clock, leading to the controversial final play.
“We’re learning every day. And some -
times we’re learning that we’ve got to not put ourselves in position [to lose] in the last six seconds,” Butler said. “I think we’ll have a lot to learn when we look at the film.”

allowing DePaul a number of easy baskets in transition. 
Entering the game Butler had 
worries about taking her inexpe-rienced team on the road, and the Gators showed their youth against a stingy DePaul team that ran the 
floor and beat UF at its own game.
It was a fast-paced, back-and-
forth contest that favored the 
hot-handed shooters. DePaul had three players score more than 15 points and the Gators had four in 
double digits.
Junior Jordan Jones shot 4 of 
9 from three-point range and fin-
ished with a team-high 14 points. Center Azania Stewart added 10 points and 9 rebounds, one board shy of consecutive double-double performances. Kayla Lewis and Lanita Bartley both chipped in 10 
points, but Bartley also added a 
costly 6 turnovers.

Now on to the picks!In first with a 60-48 record is GatorBait.net’s Keith 
“Girls my age scare me” Niebuhr, who confessed he would 
be attracted to a nice dancing instructor if not for “those 
wild eyes that every woman above 30 has.” Those “wild eyes” are what they look like when they aren’t masked by all the excessive makeup teenagers wear, Keith.
Inching closer with a record of 55-53 is alligatorSports 
assistant editor Tyler “I love America” Jett, who did his best white trash impression this week with a ragged shirt, jorts and a Nascar hat for an office theme night. He got a little too into it when he showed up at Leonardo’s and 
asked for the all-white pizza.
In third with a record of 54-54 is the Miami Herald’s Joe “Distance doesn’t dampen my hatred” Goodman, who took a brief break from his Miami Heat coverage to write 
a column saying Urban Meyer is a waste of money and then picked Appalachian State to win straight up. Next week, he’ll kidnap Albert.
In a two-way tie for fourth with a record of 53-55 is 
alligatorSports editor Anthony “That path only leads to coke and abusive boyfriends” Chiang,  who’ll return to Miami for Thanksgiving with strong words for his family after they let his little sister land a modeling gig. Give ‘em 
the same intimidating face you gave that 12-year-old who 
tried to ask her to a movie and they’re sure to fold.
Tied with Chiang is alligatorSports’ Kyle “QB-1” Mais-
tri, who is looking to parlay his flag football skills into a 7-on-7 competition against Florida’s skill players. Kyle is usually pretty laid back, but when he gets under center he morphs into an intense field general. Watch out, John Brantley and the Funky Bunch. 
And in sixth place with a 51-57 record is The Gainesville 
Sun’s Edward “Guys and Dolls” Aschoff, who confessed this week to not watching his beloved Carolina Panthers’ lone Super Bowl appearance because he was performing 
in a high school play. We understand. You don’t just turn 
down a role like Harry the Horse. 
In half-assed, second-to-last place with a 50-58 record 
is alligatorSports’ Mike “I’ll take ‘What is winning gift cards’ for $1,000” McCall, who records and studies ev-
ery episode of “Jeopardy.” That habit paid off this week at Applebee’s, where Mikey won a trivia competition for the first time ever. Congratulations, you’re now 25 Apple-
Bucks richer. 
And in dead-ass last place with a piss-poor record 
of 48-60 is FightinGators.com’s Cody “Some people just don’t appreciate prodigies” Jones, who was beside himself 
upon learning that Jason Heyward did NOT win rookie of 
the year. That’s one less newspaper clip for Cody to add to his “Hey Arnold”-like shrine.18, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 2010

College Football karma does not exist; losing seasons not inevitable
There is no college football carousel.
Teams don’t move in cycles. This was not preor -
dained. Florida was not simply due.
Coming off consecutive years as national championship 
contenders, the Gators have run a public-perception medley 
from fashionable preseason darling to underachiever to late 
bloomer to just plain bad. And now everyone wants an ex-
planation — how do you fall from the country’s elite to the 
kiddie table?
Some argue that Florida simply isn’t talented enough, that 
turning your program into an NFL machine replacing current pros with future pros is impossible. The best high school play-
ers want to start immediately, and they won’t start immedi-
ately at a school already loaded, as the theory goes.
What you are left with is the ebb and flow of two fun sea-
sons followed by a couple of depressing dry spells. While you enjoyed Tim Tebow and Percy Harvin, you missed out on the 
next Tim Tebow and Percy Harvin because no one team can 
have all that power.
But the recruiting trails have always been kind to Florida 
coaches, regardless of how many starters their team was re-turning. Every scholarship player currently on the Gators was 
part of an elite recruiting class. 
Since 2007, Florida has hauled in a trio of top-three class-
es, according to Rivals.com. The lone exception was in 2009, 
when the Gators returned almost every important player 
from their national championship squad.
But even then, when every other coach held legitimate 
ammunition against Florida, Urban Meyer still recruited the 11th-best group in the nation. If a re-cruit voiced concerns about waiting on the sidelines, Meyer could play his trump card, pulling a couple of rings out of his desk and asking, “Are you 
serious about winning one of these?”
Any player who wants a national 
title has just a handful of schools to 
choose from because college football is a blueblood league. In the last 10 years, 
only nine teams have played in a na-
tional championship game. 
If there really was some sort of unavoidable cycle, these 
nine teams would each have about four or five bad seasons 
between championship runs. But that isn’t the case.
Three losses is the barrier between a good season and a bad 
one. Depending on preseason expectations, a three-loss year 
might be seen as a disappointment. But losing three games in 
a power conference is still usually good enough for a January bowl game
And if at some point in the last three seasons you played 
for a championship, losing north of three games is disap-
pointing.
Using three losses as the threshold, Miami and Nebraska 
are the only teams that collapsed after playing for a champi-
onship. Florida, LSU and Alabama all experienced bad sea-
sons more than twice in the last 10 years, but most of those 
failures can be attributed to previous, less competent coaches 
(Ron Zook, Gerry DiNardo and Mike Shula).The other four teams (Oklahoma, Ohio State, USC and 
Texas) played at least eight good seasons before this year. Re-cruits never shied from those already talent-rich teams.
And Miami did not nosedive because of its inability to re-
cruit. The Hurricanes have strung together a run of bad sea-sons from 2006 to today, but every recruiting class since 2003 has been ranked in the top 20.
Nebraska, on the other hand, to sign big-name recruits. 
The Cornhuskers have only hauled in three top-20 classes in the past 10 years, and the group that signed after its 2001 na-tional championship appearance was ranked 40th.
But chalking up Nebraska’s recruiting impotence to hav-
ing too much pre-existing talent is a weak. The Cornhuskers followed their championship run with a 7-7 season, and their subsequent recruiting class was ranked 42nd. No matter how many positions were up for grabs, Nebraska wasn’t bringing 
in talent.
If teams play through cycles, Florida’s struggles would be 
inevitable, as would its eventual bounceback. But no team at 
Florida’s level has experienced cycles in the last 10 years, the Gators included.
Texas is having its first bad season since 1997, but its last 
four recruiting classes have been ranked, on average, seventh-best in the nation, even though each one of those teams was already loaded. 
There is no cycle. At least Florida fans better hope not. If 
there is, the Gators won’t be good again until 2012. 
And the world’s going to be ending then, anyway. It’s 
been preordained by the Mayan gods.

 UF volleyball coach Mary Wise and her team have three matches left in the 
regular season before beginning postseason play.
By MATT RUBIN
Alligator Writer
 
Florida secured a share of the Southeastern 
Conference title last weekend.
This weekend the No. 1 Gators (24-1, 17-0, 
SEC) will try to make sure they are the only ones 
receiving an SEC title trophy.
UF will get its first shot to clinch the conference 
crown against Arkansas (13-15, 7-10) tonight at 8 
in Fayetteville, Ark.
“We go to Arkansas with last year’s freshman 
player of the year in the league now as a sopho-
more,” coach Mary Wise said. “They are a team 
that plays very well at home and, prior to this past 
weekend, going on the road they have won four straight.”
The Gators defeated the Razorbacks in 
straight sets 3-0 (25-19, 25-13, 25-17) on Oct. 3 in 
Gainesville. 
Florida limited Arkansas sophomore Jasmine 
Norton to just four kills on 18 total attacks and a 
.000 hitting percentage.
“They are one of those teams, a young team, 
but they are so much better playing at home than they are on the road,” Wise said. “We’ll talk to our players that the Arkansas team that we saw in the O’Connell Center weeks ago will look very differ -
ent in Fayetteville.”
The Gators will then travel to Baton Rouge, 
La., where they will take on No. 17 LSU (23-3, 14-3) on Sunday at 2:30 p.m.
“And then Sunday’s match against LSU, a top-
20 team that plays some very fast offense,” Wise 
said. “This will be as big a weekend for us as we’ve 
had all year to play both of them on the road.”
Florida earned its share of the conference title 
after LSU was upset by Kentucky on Nov. 14. The Tigers need the Gators to lose their remaining three matches in order to get their own share of 
the title.
The Gators defeated LSU 3-1 (25-16, 20-25, 25-
22, 25-18) on Oct. 1 in Gainesville.
“The good news is that I feel like we’re playing 
solid volleyball and we have gotten so much bet-
ter than the last time we played both these teams and hope that will bear out and help us this week-end,” Wise said.Gators look to clinch sole 
possession of SEC title
“We go to Arkansas with last year’s 
freshman player of the year in the 
league now as a sophomore. They are a 
team that plays very well at home and,
