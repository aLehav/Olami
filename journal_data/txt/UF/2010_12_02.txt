LITTLE EGG HARBOR TOWNSHIP , N.J.  
— An annual Christmas mystery is playing 
itself out again along a busy New Jersey high-way.
A secret Santa is once again surreptitiously 
hanging ornaments from a large pine tree by the side of the Garden State Parkway in the dead of night.
A gold star was hanging from the boughs 
of the tree Tuesday morning.
It’s the fourth year in a row that the or -naments have shown up on the same tree in the southbound lanes in a sparsely populated area of Little Egg Harbor Township.
No one has come forward and acknowl-
edged decorating the tree. The New Jersey Turnpike Authority, which maintains the road, has said it isn’t responsible.
The ornaments appear gradually, starting 
with one or two, and eventually growing to about a dozen by Christmas.

UF will have a presence on Gov.-
elect Rick Scott’s transition team.
UF President Bernie Machen and 
UF Board of Trustees member Carlos 
Alfonso have been appointed to work on Scott’s Economic Development Transition Team and Regulatory Re-
form Transition Team, respectively.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando said 
it is early, and Machen’s responsibili-
ties on the team are not yet clear, but 
he will be a valuable resource for 
Scott.They are interested in Machen’s 
expertise in higher education and its 
impact on the economy, he said.
According to Scott’s website, the 
teams are charged 
with identifying opportunities to 
reduce the size of 
government, trans-forming the regula-
tory climate in Flor -
ida and looking for ways to attract new 
businesses to the state.
They are tasked with identifying 
new ideas from the private sector and successful examples from other 
states.
Orlando noted the importance of 
the university getting involved in 
the transition process, particularly because of its place in the state’s 
economy.
“It’s good that we can play some 
role in the transition of the adminis-
tration,” he said. “UF has a huge eco-
nomic impact on the state.”
Brent Christensen, president 
and chief operating officer of the 
Gainesville Chamber of Commerce, and John Hitt, president of the Uni-
versity of Central Florida, have also 
been given posts on the Economic Development Transition Team.Machen to work for Gov.-electOBITUARY

Over the span of 25 years, Robert Donald Allison 
stood in the front of a lecture hall, educating an esti-
mated 25,000 students who went on to become doctors, dentists and chemists. 
Allison died Saturday of injuries from a car accident 
about one month ago. He was 64. 
He taught biochemistry and molecular biology, as 
well as a biochemistry class for first-year medical stu-
dents. 
Unlike most professors, who are required to do re-
search and oversee graduate and post-doctoral stu-
dents, Allison’s attention was undivided — his role was strictly to teach, a position those who worked with him say he filled admirably. 
“He was, in a sense, the teacher’s teacher,” said Dan 
Purich, who worked closely with Allison throughout his career. “He was a model for the commitment we should 
have to our students.”
Purich and Allison worked together on three books, 
two of which, “The Handbook of Biochemical Kinet-ics” and “The Enzyme Reference,” were published. The 
third, “The Inhibitor Index,” is still a work in progress, which Purich said he plans to finish.
While they worked on the books, Purich recalled, 
students were always Allison’s first priority. A student coming by the office meant they would drop what they were doing, and Allison would immediately work to meet the student’s needs. 
Robert Flanegan, chairman of the Department of Bio-
chemistry and Molecular Biology, said Allison would often put aside time on Saturdays to hold help sessions for students.
Aside from Allison’s teaching ability and extra time 
for students, he was also fun to be around and work with, Flanegan said.
“He had a big, hearty laugh,” he said. “Usually when you had a discussion with him, he 
had a humorous point to add to it or to lighten it up a 
little bit. One thing I certainly will miss is his sense of 
humor and his laugh.”
Shannon Tocchini, Allison’s niece, said she also re-
members how generous her uncle was. 
“He was very generous — to a fault. He was more 
generous to those around him than himself.”
Allison graduated from UCLA and was an army vol-
unteer in the Vietnam War.
A memorial service will be held Thursday at 3:30 
p.m. in the auditorium of the Health Professions/Nurs-ing/Pharmacy Complex.Professor was

While electronic cigarettes are ad-
vertised as a healthier alternative to 
cigarettes containing smoke, UF and the American Lung Association op-pose them despite their claim to be bet-ter on lungs and the environment. 
Electronic cigarettes are recharge-
able, battery-operated, personal vapor -
izers that mimic the look of an actual cigarette. There is no tobacco or smoke. Instead, water vapor is inhaled, resem-bling smoke and a sensored light gets brighter when the smoker takes a puff.
“Electronic cigarettes are definitely 
not recommended for quitting smok-ing,” said Jane Emmeree, a health pro-motion specialist at GatorWell. Instead, she said, they just reinforce the motion of the habit.
She said the levels of nicotine are not 
sufficient to satisfy a habitual smoker in the first place and therefore not ef-fective for quitting.
“The American Lung Association 
is very concerned about 
Electronic Cigarettes,” 
said Erika Sward, the as-sociation’s director of 
national advocacy. “Until the FDA de-termines they are safe, they should be taken out of the marketplace.” 
Electronic cigarettes are not allowed 
on campus under the smoking ban, said UF spokesman Steve Orlando.
n SHE’S RECORDING AN ALBUM.
By MORGAN WATKINS
Alligator Contributing Writer
It’s a Saturday morning, and 
Sueli Cavalcanti has been awake 
since 6 a.m. 
It’s now 9:30 a.m., and she is 
still at Skylab Studios in Gainesville with studio owner Gerry King and her manager, Michael Deall. Two Dunkin’ Donuts coffee cups sit on a table — Sueli’s and Deall’s fuel of choice for these early sessions. 
Sueli’s here for one thing: to sing. 
Her voice carries over the light 
brown hardwood floors and through 
the glass wall of the studio’s main room. King sits at a table strewn with recording equipment, adding a techno beat.
“Breath into me … Melt into me 
… Fly to be free … With me ....”
Her black-and-white-striped 
T-shirt stretches as she swings her hands up and belts another line.Sueli, 27, is recording under her 
stage name, SueliPop. A graduate of UF’s musical theater program, she abandoned her Broadway dream to pursue one of becoming a pop star.
The singer, only five feet tall, fin-
ishes a stretch of high notes. 
“Let’s do the ending again,” King 
says. 
Sueli nods and dives back into 
the song. On a machine in the dark-paneled recording room, a bar of lights tracks her voice. It starts in the lower green lights, but as the note 
rises it shoots straight into the red.
Sueli didn’t grow up with visions 
of being Britney Spears. She thought 
her future was in musical theater. 
She planned to move to New 
York after graduating from UF’s School of Theatre and Dance bach-elor program in musical theater.
Instead, she’s living in Gainesville, 
trying to make it as a pop singer.
Recording with Skylab since 
December 2009, she is on the verge of her first release, “Take Me for a Ride.” She is also recording a full-length album she hopes to release in the spring.
“I’m not going to be like, ‘Yeah, 
I’ve done this and I’ve done that and I’m almost there,’” she said. “I know 
it could be one year, it could be two 
years, it could be five years, it could be 10 years [before I make it].”
Even as she develops her sound 
as SueliPop, she hasn’t forgotten her days in theater.
As a child, Sueli loved to sing.She performed in plays in high 
school and dreamed of being on 
Broadway. After starting at Florida 
Atlantic University, she was ac-cepted into UF’s musical theater program. About 100 students apply each year, but only four make it. 
She performed in UF productions 
like “West Side Story” and “A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum.”  But she had few friends in 
the department. She thinks the other 
students disliked her because of the roles she won. They considered her a bit of a diva, she said. 
She used antidepressants to help herself get through the days.
Sitting on her living room couch, 
Sueli’s voice wavers as she talks about UF. Her hand fidgets against her leg, tucked underneath her. 
“I felt like I was trapped and I 
couldn’t get out. I felt like I was be-ing tortured for no reason. It sounds kind of emo, but it was how I felt.”
This is one of the first times she’s 
really thought about what happened since she graduated. Her boyfriend, Zach Stashis, moves to the couch, placing a hand on her shoulder. Her 
manager hands her a tissue. 
After countless practices with 
students who didn’t like her, she 
now feels comfortable working with two — Jackie Zima, 21, and Dayana Falcon, 21 — who perform as back-up dancers at her concerts. They smile at her as they plan new steps to her song “Take Me for a Ride.” 
When Zima fumbles a move, they 
all laugh and suggest changing that part.  It still feels strange, laughing her way through a practice instead of forcing herself through one. 
Since graduating from UF in 
2009, Sueli stopped  taking antide-pressants — she’s happy almost ev-ery day now, Stashis says. 
It’s a nice change from the girl 
who came home from practices qui-et and upset. 
Although Sueli says she loves the 
creative aspects of her job, SueliPop is a business. It’s a brand — a way to make people notice her, from con-cert audiences to record company executives. 
She chose the name SueliPop be-
cause it draws attention to her name and personality and also alerts lis-teners to her music style. 
Without a strong brand, her pas-
sion could amount to nothing. 
“The world works in terms of 
what makes money. That will never go away ,” Sueli says. “I’m always 
constantly thinking, ‘Is this some-
thing that someone can look at as a marketable product?’”
After almost a year of working in 
private, she is taking her first public steps as SueliPop. She is perform-ing concerts in Gainesville and later wants to do a statewide tour.When she isn’t working as Sueli-
Pop, she earns money giving voice and piano lessons and performing with Deall at an Ocala country club. 
She has faith, and so do her 
friends. But no matter how hard she works, her fate isn’t guaranteed.
“You can rest when you’ve 
worked to get to where [you want to be],” she says. “Until then, it’s hell 
week, it’s hell month, it’s hell year.”
She has learned that some people 
don’t follow through on promises. 
People who seem enthusiastic about her project have pledged their help, only to fail to return her phone calls. Maybe they were just busy. Or may-be they really don’t want to help. 
“I’m the type of person [who 
feels] it needs to be perfect. The mindset is: Okay, we’ll find some-one else or take care of it ourselves,” she says.
When the stress is too much, she 
hops on her skateboard or plays with her small, fluffy dog, Fiji.
She also finds an escape in exer -
cise. She works out several days a 
week to stay healthy and in shape 
— in the pop industry, image can be as important as voice. Exercise lets her forget about the stress. When she runs on the treadmill or lifts weights, she can forget about her to-do list for the day.
She just keeps moving forward. 
Keeps singing new notes in front of 
the keyboard. Keeps practicing with 
two of the first partners who smile at her sincerely.
Sueli stomps her feet and hits her 
final mark as the ending notes of “Take Me for a Ride” fade. Zima and Falcon talk about a section where they improvise their moves. 
Sueli jokes that she should throw 
in some country dancing, launch-ing into a rendition of June Carter Cash’s “Juke Box Blues.” Grabbing the waistband of her sweatpants, she kicks her feet alternately in a dis-play more appropriate for a country club like Gainesville’s :08 than a pop singer’s dance practice. 
“It’s like Miley Cyrus, three-di-
mensional,” a dance says. 
Sueli laughs, smiles and gets 
back to work.4, ALLIGATOR n  THURSDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2010

UF officials have preliminarily deemed the 
results from Wednesday’s test of the UF Alert 
system positive.
According to UF figures, 64,396 texts were 
sent to the aggregator, which sends it to stu-dents, in one minute and 52 seconds, an im-provement from the test last April, which set the record at three minutes and 24 seconds.
“It’s much more in the neighborhood of 
where we want it,” said UF spokesman Steve Orlando. “It’s much better.” 
The number of people opting out of the text 
notifications system decreased by about 800, from 2,877 to 2,035. 
E-mails were sent to 82,098 ufl.edu accounts 
with a lag — 47 percent were delivered at 10 minutes and 65 percent at 20 minutes. 
An e-mail sent to administrators said previ-
ous tests have demonstrated that more than 90 percent of the messages can be delivered by the 20-minute mark. UF Computer & Networking Services is researching the issue. 
Orlando said the university is pleased to see 
an increase in students following UF’s social media pages on Facebook and Twitter.
“No one should become reliant on any sin-
gle way of receiving the message,” he said.UF officials happy with

n IT INCLUDES SIX VOUCHERS FOR 
LOCAL FINE ARTS EVENTS.
By JESSICA KAUFMAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Just in time for the holidays, the UF College 
of Fine Arts is offering a subscription package 
for six local art organizations.
Subscribers will receive six vouchers. The 
vouchers will come from Dance Alive National 
Ballet, Hippodrome Theatre, Hippodrome 
Cinema, UF’s School of Music, UF School of Theatre and Dance and UF Performing Arts. 
The Gainesville Entertainment Sampler can 
be bought for $89 for the rest of this month and next spring.
Each voucher is worth one ticket, except for 
the Hippodrome Cinema’s voucher, which is worth two tickets. Each voucher has specific 
instructions on how to redeem a ticket. 
“All the box offices are very accommodat-
ing and will help explain everything and take 
care of you,”said Andy Howard, a College of Fine Arts spokesman. “The website we devel-oped is an alliance, specifically a collaborative audience development project, nothing formal, just the five organizations working together.” 
Howard said he got the idea for the sampler 
from his former job in Orlando. 
“I lived here (Gainesville) for undergrad 
and never saw the different organizations come together to discuss ideas and collabo-rate,” he said. “The initial feeling was people weren’t going to get together, but they agreed to give it a try.” 
There is no intention of making a formal col-
laboration or new organization, Howard said. 
“The Gainesville Entertainment Sampler 
will provide students with greater flexibil-ity and variety,” he said. “It’s sustainable and gives people more time and a better experience more than anything, and it supports the local nonprofit scene.”Howard said an economic component did 
come into play with this idea.
“This is a hard time for arts and nonprofits. 
The rest of the world is experiencing what we normally go through, and our times are hard-er,” Howard said. “There’s a tendency in the arts and nonprofits to be doing more to prove you’re worth it.”  
The main revenue goal, Howard said, is to 
reach new audiences so the income generated will help cover the new costs.
“A lot of time, it is difficult for art groups 
to develop new interests and communicate with people who have been in touch with us in previous years,” he said. “The quality of arts in this city is pretty high per capita, and Gainesville has a very big art scene. There is a lot of uniqueness of culture only here in 
Gainesville.”
Sato also expressed a level of excitement for 
the arts.
“I loved Dance Alive’s ‘Dracula’ because it 
was something different from all 
of the modern shows I’ve seen,” 
she said.
The College of Fine Arts was 
able to purchase a mailing list of new people 
that none of the organizations have been able to get their hands on, and it proposed this sam-ple package.
“The Gainesville Entertainment Sampler al-
lows subscribers to see the entire city’s thriving culture, from the classical works to the lesser 
known works or more family-oriented works,” 
Howard said.
The sampler package started in late sum-
mer and launched full throttle in fall. The ex-piration date of each voucher is up to the indi-vidual organization.
“You can divide $89 into six different cul-
tural experiences instead of six movies and get a lot more live entertainment at that price,” Howard said. “We have to get people moving around, talking about it and develop a new au-dience of people that haven’t been to the arts.”UF sells local art package

Myung Woo, an environmental engineering graduate student, was west-
bound on Southwest Archer Road when she lost control of her 1999 Sub-aru Outback, ran over a tree and flipped the vehicle. No one was injured, though Gainesville Police blocked off the left eastbound lane with a GPD police car. Woo climbed out of the passenger side door to get out of the overturned vehicle. She only received minor injuries on her left arm. Brett Smith, a GPD officer who reported to the scene, said he couldn’t see how the woman lost control of the vehicle.

Wednesday’s question: Is it too 
early for Christmas music?40% YES60% NO
127 TOTAL VOTESToday’s question: Should states have more power than the federal government?
Where the buffalo roam
If a certain proposal being 
discussed goes into effect, Paynes Prairie Preserve 
State Park will be preserving a whole lot less.
A current plan being de-
bated to reduce the herd of bison and wild horses roam-ing the 22,000-acre park to 12 females is counterintuitive to the natural elements of what exactly Alachua County resi-dents want to preserve.
 As for the remaining pal-
try number of wild animals kept for the appeasement of the public? They’ll be con-tained in a much-smaller 150-acre viewing center. 
About 100 people attended 
a meeting Tuesday evening to relay public comments on the proposal to remove most of 
the bison from Paynes Prairie.
We feel attendee Bruce 
Hicks said it best — “Once you 
put animals into a contain-ment for viewing, isn’t that a zoo and not a preserve?”Park officials have said the 
proposal to remove the major -
ity of the wild herd is largely in order to protect the pub-lic from bison that might or might not escape.
While we strongly agree 
protecting public safety should 
be the No. 1 concern, park of-
ficials have not demonstrated that the bison or horses pose a great enough threat to the public to warrant selling them to the highest bidder. 
Moreover, attendees at 
Tuesday evening’s public comment meeting threw dag-
gers at the park’s highest-bid-

aligns with a very “preserva-tionary” mindset. Let the buf-falo roam.If the Tea Party has its way, Tallahassee, Dover, Salt Lake City and company will reign supreme over Washington, D.C.
Introducing the “repeal amendment” Tuesday, Rep. Rob 
Bishop hopes to make a 28th Amendment to the Constitu-
tion.
Bishop, a Republican from Utah, said the so-called repeal 
amendment would reinforce the 10th Amendment’s power to 
give states superiority over the federal government so things like the health care bill, auto bailout and stimulus package would never happen again.
Also Tuesday, a federal judge in Virginia threw out a chal-
lenge to the federal health care bill, citing the Commerce Clause in the Constitution.
The Editorial Board is a big fan of speaking its mind and 
objecting to ill-devised plans or policies, so in that sense, we applaud the Tea Party and Rep. Bishop for trying to right what they feel is wrong.
But as several prominent legal scholars agree, this pro-
posed 28th Amendment would reduce the collective govern-ment of the U.S. to the ineffectiveness and inefficient days of the Articles of Confederation, which was rejected because ultimately states did whatever they felt was best. 
The federal government already works at a slow pace 
with the bipartisan bickering. This proposed amendment would do little to help that fact, as it doesn’t stipulate a time limit for states to repeal anything. 
Most importantly, the proposed amendment would send 
the country into legislative chaos, opening up questions that plague every bit of the Constitution, including appropriation powers to powers to declare war.

Christmas music not joyful to everyone
I have a confession to make, and it’s not going to be 
easy. I’ve carried this burden for many years, and I’m not quite sure how to just bare it for all to see. 
I’m told confession is cathartic, so here goes: I don’t like Christmas music. 
I know. Call me a Scrooge if you must, but it’s not my 
choice. I think I was born this way.
It’s not that I hate Christmas, family, carolers or even 
the frenzied shopping season that’s taken the place of a religious holiday. I just don’t like the music.
I wasn’t booted down a slide by Santa. I never shot 
my eye out. And I was certainly never beat up by Scut 
Farkus. I don’t know what gene I’m missing almost 
everyone else seems to possess, but somewhere in the shuffle I missed why any radio station would be so pos-sessed as to play Christmas music from before now un-
til Christmas. 
I recently confided this dark secret in a friend who 
then divulged she too was opposed to Christmas music, 
so I know I’m not alone, which just makes my condition that much more perplexing. 
Curiouser and curiouser still is my track record with 
Christmas music. I’ve caroled; there are Christmas al-bums on my iPod. I have even been in countless Christ-mas programs. Moreover I, like all good Americans, 
like “It’s a Wonderful Life,” “Miracle on 34th Street,” 
“Elf” and countless other Christmas classics. My favor -
ite Christmas movie, however, has to be “A Christmas Story,” and maybe that’s a clue to my disinterest in the seasonal tunes. 
If you’ve seen that movie, you know it’s not the aver -
age Christmas movie. “A Christmas Story” recounts the tale of a child’s Christmas from the clarity and perhaps cynicism of adulthood. It follows the lovable Ralphie as he tries to navigate all the greed, awkward-
ness, parental rage and gift disap-
pointment that accompanies family holidays. The film 
has a surprisingly happy ending, and not just because Ralphie receives “a Red Ryder BB gun with a compass 
in the stock, and this thing which tells time.” 
The movie has a happy ending because ultimately 
the average middle-class American family makes the 
decision to be a family, overlook one another’s glaring shortcomings and go eat Chinese food on Christmas. 
But without the countless things that went wrong — 
the vicious family repartee, the destructive dogs from next door, the evil and stupid bully — the final scenes of the film would be far less poignant. 
So, I guess I wouldn’t hate Christmas music if I 
wasn’t inundated with it 24/7. I just feel like it misses the point. What I find amazing about Christmas is not the Norman Rockwell picture-perfect image of opening presents on Christmas. 
What I find amazing about Christmas is all the stuff 
that happens before and after that picture — all the squabbles, difficulties and frustrations that come with making a family work. What blows me away is the fact 
that, year after year, despite all odds, families all across 
the world manage to come together under heartwarm-ing circumstances and give each other the purity of their goodwill.
If I ever hear that in a Christmas song perhaps I’ll 
change my views.

Letters to the Editor
Americans shouldn’t become 
complacent in concern for hunger of less fortunate
The issue of world hunger has existed 
for many years. As an American, I know 
I sometimes forget the problem is right in my own backyard. 
Many American families during the 
holidays get together and feast on deli-cious foods, many times devouring more than they can handle. 
Yet thousands of families lack a decent 
meal. 
This lack of food among millions of 
Americans is not only during the holiday season but all year. 
Although many of us may find our -
selves not being able to commit to year-round volunteering efforts and assisting with the hunger problem, helping out during the holiday season is a great way to start. 
My family and I volunteer every year 
with Hosea Feed the Hungry and Home-less to try to distribute meals to those in need especially during the holiday sea-son. 
According to the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, millions of people still live 
in households considered food insecure, 
meaning food is not available in the home to meet the required minimum caloric in-take set by the Centers for Disease Con-trol.  
As a U.S. citizen, I feel that it’s my civic 
duty to try to help aid in the hunger prob-lem. 
Many times during the school year, I 
find myself saying I’m too busy to volun-teer; I have a paper due or a test coming up. 
Many times I get complacent in my 
concerns for those in America, thinking there are charities taking care of hunger in America and thinking the greatest hunger problems are in other countries. 
I know there are many students on the 
UF campus feeling and thinking the same way. 
I urge students to start helping with the 
hunger issue facing America during the holidays by volunteering and helping with one family or one charity at a time.
During the winter break, there are no 
schedule hindrances with school, and even if you work at some point during the break, you find yourself having a few extra hours to spare. 
Even if you don’t know a charity host-
ing an event, there might be a family living in your neighborhood that lacks food. 
Donating food to a charity is always 
helpful, but actually going out and volun-teering is more satisfying and impactful. 
As college students, we live in our own 
bubble of school, work and extracurricular activities and often think the college life is 
so difficult. 
But we overlook the basic necessities 
that are given to us daily, such as a good 
meal. 
There are millions of people in America 
who need food, and what’s a better way to start helping out with this issue than to give food donations, time and attention to helping solve the hunger problem?
Maybe helping feed those who lack food 
will become a monthly or even daily activ-ity. The holiday season is a special time for families, so why not help make it special for a family that really needs help? 
It’s sad when talking to a child who 
lacks food at home to hear her or him say, “I don’t want toys for Christmas. All I want is a good meal.”

Teachers should be qualified on paper 
and in class
Andrew Pantazi’s pseudo-rant Tuesday 
regarding UF’s less-than-stellar faculty 
choices really resonated with me, though he probably put it a lot more nicely than I would have.
A university is an institution that facili-
tates learning, is it not?
 So why is it I find myself dozing off, 
unable to pay even an inch of attention as Name Unimportant, Ph.D., drones on about topics I can easily grasp by skim-ming a secondhand textbook I picked up for $30 while my meager earnings are dis-persed into the university and into Dr. So-
and-So’s pockets?
Sitting through lecture after lecture for 
years on end is something we all take part 
in, so shouldn’t there be some element that sets our professors apart from any one of us?
To me, that element is experience. 
Whether it be working 10 years in a drug addiction clinic or being the addict sitting 
in Narcotics Anonymous meetings night 
after night, it’s the experience and the knowledge that you walk away with that truly matters.It makes no difference to me what pres-
tigious establishments the professors here  
might or might not have graduated from. 
I don’t know what anyone else in the 
Student Body thinks, but as long as an in-
dividual exhibits a profound and unique understanding of the subject material, whether it be from attending countless symposiums and doing extensive research or from simply living, that individual should be qualified enough to relay this information to others.
If any one of you have ever begrudg-
ingly slumped in your chair, grumbling “I could have taught this course better than this joker!” you’re probably right. 
The army of teachers’ assistants might 
be articulate and knowledgeable, but they better have something more to tell me than “Hey, this is Chapter 1, let me break it down for you in case you forgot how to 
read.”
We’d all rather hear about the time 
you were in that shady place with those 
sketchy people and ended up learning a valuable lesson about economics and so-ciology.
The next time you find yourself mind-
lessly doodling over your professor’s Pow-erPoint notes or checking your Facebook 
frantically, praying one of your friends 
might sign on and save your sanity, ask yourself this: Why is it I’m sitting here, struggling to scribble down a definition I can find verbatim in my textbook? 
One’s worth and potential to teach is 
not defined by the few letters that follow their name on the syllabus.

Make it a holi‘DIY’: Get local, crafty with seasonal shopping   
By KAT BEIN 
and BRITT PERKINSavenue writers
It’s that time of year again.
Just in time for finals — and all those 
end-of-semester projects you’re just starting 
— it’s the holiday shopping season. Naturally, 
you’ve already burned through your scholarship 
and grant money, and now you’re scurrying to 
sell your clothes, video games and blood plas-ma to make enough money to buy sweet gifts so your friends think you care.
Do you even have time to go shopping?
Well, good news: It doesn’t have to be that 
complicated.
At the Avenue, we’re poor, busy college kids, 
too, and we put our ears to the ground to find 
the best ways for you to make or buy memo-rable and creative gifts for everyone you know.
In this issue, we’ve got the details about the 
Glam Indie Craft show, where you can load up on locally crafted gifts. And if you need an ex-cuse to procrastinate, we have the details on the best place to go to make your own gifts for 
Mom and Dad. We’ve even got a way you can 
turn that 99-cent record from the thrift store into a serious work of custom art, courtesy of two talented UF artists.
Consider this your holiday gift from the Av -

The graduate: Get smart with cell
By LANE NIESET
avenue writer
Whether you plan on rocking your cap and gown this 
month or have a few more semesters to trudge through 
— and we don’t judge, super seniors —  let’s be honest: “Pomp and Circumstance” has been on your playlist ever since your Preview adviser told you UF boasts the high-
est graduation rate in the state. So, as you prepare for 
your official inauguration into the “real wold,” it’s time to ditch that cinder block in your pocket you call your cell phone.
Sure, you have your reasons. Maybe you’ve been 
holding off with your standard model because you only need your phone to make calls and send text messages. Maybe you’re emulating Fred Flintstone. But as a bud-ding young professional, it’s time to join the 21st cen-
tury with a phone that can keep you just as connected 
with the world as you need to be. Mobile e-mail. Mobile Facebook. Even Twitter on-the-go. You’ll want to put a smartphone on your graduation gift list — and if you’re not graduating yet, you’ll have to take it up with Santa.
To get you all the details, the Avenue tested out one 
such smartphone, the new Blackberry Torch, for a week, courtesy of Blackberry.
Touch screen: The Torch has the business aspect of 
the Blackberry, but the touch screen feature makes it just as fun as the iPhone when looking at photos and browsing online. Unlike the previous model, the Storm, 
this touch screen works just like the iPhone.
The screen flips when you flip the phone, so you can 
use it vertically or horizontally — and it doesn’t lag. The 
larger screen also gives you more room to read articles and play games.
Blackberry Messenger: Also known as BBM. This is 
just more fun with a touch screen. You can even have group chats with your friends and insert photos directly into the conversation. BBM runs through the Internet 
and is a great way to keep in touch with friends studying 
abroad.
Social feeds: You can stay updated on Facebook, 
Twitter and MySpace (if you happen to still use that). The Torch will notify you when you’ve received any new com-ments or messages, and you can update all of these ac-counts right from your phone.
Endless apps: The applications are a little over -
whelming, but once you figure out which ones are worth 
it, they can definitely be a time-saver. Need to get some -
where?  The YPmobile app uses the GPS feature to track 
your location and find places nearby, get directions and even find gas prices. For those of you who can’t navigate Gainesville once you leave University Avenue or 13th Street, the AT&T Navigator application will not only give you the route, it will also say it out loud.

Here’s something that’s not in 
your textbook: Our study routines 
(or lack thereof) just aren’t work -
ing. So, in the spirit of the quickly approaching finals week, the Av -
enue created the ultimate study 
guide. Armed with our own home -
work — and short attention spans 
— we investigated all over campus and found the best and worst loca-tions for our academic needs.
The BestThe law library: When you ac-
tually need to get work done, head here for a quiet environment. Look 
around you —  your research paper 
won’t seem so bad when you see those fat law school textbooks.
The basement of Library West: 
No cell phone service, no problem. Ben Hill Griffin Stadium: The 
best place to get some quality 
thinking done, hands down — un-
less it’s game day, of course.
The WorstBroward Beach: Who can ac-
tually get work done while they’re

way? Enjoy the rays.

one knows it’s more of a social

   MUSIC TO YOUR WALLET
  Tony Feria is a junior majoring in 
food resource economics. David Aron-
son is a senior majoring in painting. Together, they are Zombie Vinyl, and 
they’re bringing dead records back to 
life.
  For about $15 to $25, these guys 
can turn a boring, old record into a beautiful, shiny design of your choos-ing.
  Feria got the idea to use records as 
an artistic medium when he saw some-thing similar at an art festival, and he pitched the idea to Aronson when they became roommates. After experi-menting with different techniques and 
paints, they’ve settled into their own 
style. The duo la yers patterns and 
homemade stencils with spray paint 
to create their art.  They usually stick to what they 
know and love, and the walls of their 
downtown apartment are covered with their creations, depicting their favorite bands, DJs and hip-hop artists. Their work isn’t conﬁ  ned to musical acts, and they’re open to recreating pictures 
of friends and famous works of art.
  The guys have only just begun their 
business: They created their ﬁ  rst vinyl 
in June, a two-tone portrait of John Len-non.
        To check out their work, visit 
zombievinyls.com, or ﬁ  nd them on Facebook, which is where they prefer you place your orders.
  GO LOCAL — THEN GO HOME
  Featuring the works of 30 local ar-
tisans, the second annual Glam Indie Craft Show offers unique gifts for even the toughest Secret Santa pick. 
  The biggest bonus: Meeting the ar-
tisans and handling their wares allows you to avoid the perils of misleading 
Web pictures and questionable sourc-
es.
  Derby ladies from the Alachua 
County Rollers will be skating swag bags to the ﬁ  rst 100 attendees, and DJ Phred will be providing the music. Ter-ranova Catering will be on hand to help with your shopping munchies.
  The craft show is Sunday from 
1 p.m. to 5 p.m. at the down-town Gainesville Thelma Bol-ton Center, 516 NE Second Ave. 
  What to look for when you hit up the 
show:
  Kim Taylor, Gainesville’s own 
Sassy Crafter blogger and organizer 
of the Glam Indie Craft Show, offers 
insight into this year’s crafting trends.
  1. Dude crafts  Because “cute” and “crafty” go to-
gether like peas and carrots, some of you more macho folk may not be down for an overload of adorable. But hand-made can get very rugged indeed.
  Look for: wallets, screen print-
ed tees, tattoo aftercare cream    
  2. Cruelty-free/vegan body prod-
ucts
  No matter what your mom says, 
it’s not just what’s on the inside that counts.
  Look for: eye shadow, lotion, 
body scrub bars, shaving soap
3  . Upcycled items  “Upcycling means taking something 
that had one purpose in life and turn-ing it into something fresh and new,” Taylor said. 
  Look for: auto parts as necklaces, 
coffee bags as wallets, vintage chil-
dren’s book covers as notebook covers  4. Amigurumi
  Japanese for “crocheted stuffed 
doll,” Taylor describes amigurumi as “quirky, cute and plushy.” These crafts vary in size, color and theme, so they are perfect for kids or the young at heart. 
  Look for: sea crea-
tures, elves and Lady Gaga
GATORS DO IT ON CAMPUS  
  Nothing says, “I love you, Mom” like 
something with your signature chicken-scratched on the back. The Arts and Crafts Center, located in the basement of the Reitz Union, can help you make this happen.
  “Even if someone believes they are 
not artistically inclined, we still encour-age them to come in,” said Stefanie Upshaw, the student manager of the center.
  Choose from colors like “Pink Pas-
sion,” “Granny Smith” and “Pepe le Blue,” then apply them to a ceramic ornament (from $3.50 for an orna-ment to $16 for a gnome). All glazing 
and ﬁ  ring is included in the cost. Dec. 
15 is the last day to paint a piece be-fore break, and those creations will be ready for pick up Dec. 17.
    The center is open from 1 p.m. to 
10 p.m. on Monday through Thursday and 1 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. on Fridays. thursday, december 2, 2010   ALLIGATOR, 11 10, ALLIGATOR  thursday, december 2, 2010
Is it possible to hit rock bottom?   
 Dear Jared,
I’m a gay male in a fresh relationship, 
and we’ve been having a lot of sex lately. I’ve found myself being on the receiv-ing end, so to speak, more often than not, which got me thinking: Should I be afraid my bottom end will eventually fall out from ‘bottoming’ too much? I’ve heard rumors of older gay men having to wear diapers later in life. Is this a valid concern?
Woefully worried,
Wide Open Spaces
  Allow me to ﬁ  rst congratulate you on abstain-
ing from getting to know your boyfriend be-fore allowing him an all-access backstage 
pass. That whole six-month rule is for chumps.
  And to answer your question, honey, let me 
ﬁ  rst give you the short answer: Not really.
  Episodes of prolonged anal incontinence, or 
a loosey-goosey caboosey for all non-sciencey kids out there, is relatively uncommon in the sil-ver daddy population of old, gay men. And when these episodes of daddy diapers actually do sur-face, they’re more often the result of brain inju-ries or side effects to certain medications that come as a package deal with age. 
  But as I say that, my little Butt Pirate, I would 
be mistaken if I said it’s not something in the back of every gay man’s mind. Although it’s fairly uncommon, it should be something you’re careful 
about. 
  Your anus isn’t Super-
man, and its Kryptonite 
can easily be your boy-friend’s Wolverine.
  Damage to your 
sphincter (your No. 1 butt muscle) can cause a mess of concerns, so 
tell your counterpart in this not-so ambiguously gay duo to watch the gyrations and not be such a Dora the Backdoora Explora.
  And although I’m saying circumstances involv-
ing you rushing to buy a pack of Huggies would be rare, I wouldn’t exactly recommend going down under after going to town on a grande, ex-tra spicy Meximelt or immediately following your Thanksgiving cornucopia. 
  Which brings me to my next point: If over-
exertion is causing you to be such a worrywart, have you and your boyfriend discussed your top-bottom schedule? Maybe on Tuesdays, Thurs-days, President’s Day and every other weekend you get the shaft and reverse on the others?Then again, I’m a ﬁ  rm believer in getting the plea-sures you deserve, so if you’ve worked your ass off all week and enjoy being an active bottom, 
you have my full support. Just know your limit and 
stay out of the deep end.
Bottoms up!
  “Black Swan”
 Dancing movies aren’t hard to 
come by. In fact, some would 
say Hollywood’s obsession with them 
has become laughable (see “Center Stage,” 
“Save the Last Dance” and all of those “Step 
Up” movies). But thankfully, this one’s got a 
twist – and a good one. In this psychological thriller, Natalie Portman, who may receive an Oscar nod for her performance, and Mila Kunis (“That ‘70s Show,” “Family Guy”) play ballet dancing rivals with different approaches to the art.Each Thursday, the Avenue is serving up the best in

see“No Mercy”
The King is no longer un-
caged. Before getting busted 
for pot possession in September, T.I. 
was a free man who had served his time and was ready to release his comeback album, pre-
viously titled “King Uncaged.” However, as the 
rap extraordinaire is back in jail, his album, set to be released Tuesday, has been renamed “No Mercy.” And despite the rapper’s 11 months of impending jail time, you can be sure the album will perform well, as it features some of the industry’s high rollers, including Eminem, Drake and Kanye West.listenBy MELINDA CARSTENSEN

 “Glee,” the Holiday 
episode
 Buddy, Will Ferrell’s character in 
the Christmas ﬂ  ick “Elf,” always said, “The 
best way to spread Christmas cheer is [by] singing loud 
for all to hear.” That’s exactly what the kids of “Glee” will be doing Tuesday. In the hit show’s holiday epi-
sode, someone in glee club almost lets slip that Santa 
Claus isn’t real, almost crushing the blissful ignorance of our favorite blonde airhead, Brittany. To keep Britt’s holiday spirit intact, the Gleeks rock around the Christmas tree like there’s no tomorrow. But Sue Sylvester, the moaning, groaning tyrant we all love to hate, is more of a Grinch than ever – jeopardizing the success of the glee club’s efforts. Watch at 8 p.m. on FOX.watch Inception on Blu-Ray and 
DVD
  With Netﬂ  ix, iTunes and Hulu, it’s 
hardly worth buying DVDs and Blu-ray discs any-
more. But make no mistake: “Inception” is an excep-
tion. It’s sure to be one of the most popular stocking stuffers this holiday season (shout-out, Santa), and the 
Blu-ray combo pack has lots of extra goodies – other 
than the fantastic ﬂ  ick itself – including interviews with dream scientists, trailers and backstage footage that reveals some of the ﬁ  lm’s most complex and dream-like special effects. buysex and the swamp 

ORLANDO — In the first collegiate game 
on a new NBA floor, the Gators looked like 
they didn’t belong. 
And, fittingly, they fell to the son of an 
NBA legend. 
No. 18 Florida (5-2) came in to Orlando’s 
Amway Center with a 9-0 all-time series lead against UCF (6-0), but an anemic offense and the play of sophomore Marcus Jordan com-bined to hand it a 57-54 loss Wednesday.
Jordan recorded a team-high 18 points 
and scored or assisted on nine of the Knights’ final 11 points. 
“Marcus has the ability to create and 
make plays for our basketball team, and that was really, really huge down the stretch,” 
UCF coach Donnie Jones said.
Senior Vernon Macklin did everything he 
could to keep Florida in the game, scoring 20 
points and grabbing eight rebounds despite playing just 20 minutes due to foul trouble. 
Macklin appeared to be an unstoppable 
force in the paint, scoring on 10 of his 11 
shot attempts. 
“I was just working on getting it up, 
my hook shot,” Macklin said. “I have been 
shooting flat, so I have just been working on that. I made good moves, and I’m thankful for my teammates passing the ball.”
But aside from Macklin, the Gators strug-
gled mightily on offense as the rest of the team shot just 28 percent from the floor. 
Despite their struggles and Macklin’s 
hot night, the Gators failed to get the ball to 
Macklin with frequency in the game’s clos-
ing minutes due to what sophomore Kenny Boynton called “selfish” play. 
“When they’re playing they should be 
seeing the fact that Vernon is having a big night,” coach Billy Donovan said. “But we’re too wrapped up in, ‘I didn’t get a shot now.’ Or, ‘I missed my last one.’”
Donovan added: “I think we’re not a co-
hesive team right now, certainly on the of-fensive end of the floor. What I think they’re doing right now is they’re not playing to-gether, and they’re not utilizing each other’s individual talents.”
Florida’s leaders in offensive futility were 
Chandler Parsons and Alex Tyus, who com-
bined to shoot 1 for 14 from the floor. 
Parsons’ performance was particularly 
disappointing, as he scored just two points and went 0 for 6 — including an air ball — 
from the free throw line in front of a large 
contingent of fans who came from his near -
by hometown of Casselberry.
“I’m extremely disappointed in the way 
I played and the way our team played,” 
Parsons said. “I had a tremendous struggle 
shooting the ball.” 
Despite Macklin’s overall offensive suc-
cess, he struggled from the line, too. 
The senior was just 0 for 2, but with his 
season average sitting at 23 percent Dono-van said it is likely he would’ve been fouled 
had the team attempted to find him down the stretch. 
“I have to focus in,” Macklin said. “I have 
to spend more time in the gym, work on my 
free throws, block out a lot of things and 
keep on shooting the same shot.” 
The Gators’ offense also struggled from 
behind the 3-point line, shooting just 2 for 13. 
Jones, who served as Donovan’s assistant 
at UF for 11 years, said this was mostly by design, as UCF was determined to stick with 
their man-to-man defense to guard the 3 re-
gardless of Macklin’s interior success.Gators fail to overcome offensive woes in upset loss
College football’s bowl sea-
son is almost upon us, and my emotions are mixed to 
say the least. 
On one hand, I love sports of 
all kinds and watch pretty much any and all “big games.” No mat-
ter the league. College or pro. 
On the other hand, I hate the 
way college football is run. 
I’m in an abusive relationship, 
and I don’t know how to get out. 
I don’t want to show my sup-
port for a system broken beyond 
repair by watching all the confer -
ence championship games and bowl games over the next month, 
but as an avid sports fan, I don’t know how NOT to watch. 
I’d only be kidding the readers 
and myself if I swore not to tune in to any of the postseason games 
in protest, but I wish I could do something to show how upset I am about the way things work. 
Wednesday, I found out that 
Cam Newton was ruled eligible to play Saturday before I ever found out that he was ruled ineli-gible by Auburn and the NCAA earlier this week. Newton gets to 
play, even though he was found 
in violation of college football’s amateurism rule because his dad shopped him to Mississippi State 
like a sleazy used car salesman for as much 
as $200,000. Georgia re-
ceiver A.J. 
Green was suspended for four 
games for 
selling his own jersey for $1,000. 
I hate college football. TCU just announced it will 
be joining the Big East in 2012, despite obvious geographical in-congruities. The Big Ten has had 11 teams since 1990 and will add 
another next season. The Pac-10 will have 12 teams next year as 
well. 
I hate college football. 
Boise State isn’t legitimate be-
cause it plays the “little sisters of 
the poor” during its conference schedule (which it can’t change), 
but Ohio State is legit because 
it voluntarily schedules its own little sisters of the poor during the non-conference. Boise State likely will have beaten the Pac-10 and ACC champs in consecutive 
years. The Broncos have lost two 
games in the past three seasons but once again won’t get a chance to compete for a national cham-
pionship because their kicker missed a chip-shot field goal last 
weekend. 
I hate college football. 
Multiple teams can finish the 
season undefeated. Instead of 
deciding who the best team is on the field, we are forced to eye 
test and argue. The same way we 
eye-tested and argued our way to preseason rankings of No. 3 and No. 4 for Florida and Texas be-fore this season began. 
I hate college football. 
The Big East will get millions 
of dollars for its automatic bid to 
a BCS Bowl game, where a pos-sible four-loss, unranked team

CLEVELAND — Mo Williams knows 
the pain and frustration Cleveland fans have 
been feeling since LeBron James left town six months ago.
That’s one reason why Williams is look-
ing forward to Thursday night, when James makes his long-awaited return to Cleveland as a member of the Miami Heat. The Cavaliers guard understands why fans around the re-gion still feel betrayed about James’ departure after playing in Cleveland for seven years.
“This game is not just for us,” Williams 
said following practice Wednesday . “It’s the 
20,000 fans and the millions watching who 
will be pulling for us.
The schedule says the Cavaliers will play 
their 18th game of the season, but Williams isn’t kidding anyone. This will be no normal game. This will be no walk in the park.
“It’s definitely more than a game, I can tell 
you that,” Williams said. “This game has been circled. There’s a lot of playoff feeling going 
on.”
Williams says he and the Cavaliers are ex-
cited about the opportunity to face their for -
mer teammate, who led the franchise to the 
NBA Finals in 2007 and to the league’s best record the last two seasons.
“The whole world is watching,” Williams 
said. “It’s something that will go in the history books. I’ll be a part of it. I’m proud of that.”
Williams, acquired from Milwaukee prior 
to the 2008-09 season, was more troubled by James’ decision to leave than any player still on the team. He was quoted in a story during the summer that he considered retirement, comments which he backtracked on at the team’s media day.
Williams and James 
had a chance meeting after “The Decision” in which 
they cleared the air. Wil-
liams said they have not spoken since.
“That’s in the past,” he 
said. “It’s over and done with. We can go on and on with it. We talked about it. 
This summer, I voiced my opinions. I put it behind me. It’s not personal. It’s not personal 
at all.”
If any Cleveland players feel resentment to-
ward James, they’re keeping it to themselves.
“I think we are all looking forward,” guard 
Daniel Gibson said. “We’re ready for the op-
portunity . He did what he had to do and it’s a matter of us doing what we have to do. That was the approach we took from day one and that’s the approach we still have.”
Gibson came to Cleveland as a 20-year-old 
rookie out of the University of Texas in 2006. 
He said he and James still keep in touch.
“He looked out for me,” Gibson said. “He 
showed me the ropes, and now it’s time for 
me to go out and help this team win and beat a team that we want to beat.” 
While the subject of whether James misses 
Cleveland hasn’t come up in their conversa-tions, Gibson believes that is indeed the case.
“For you to play here the amount of time 
he did, there’s no way in your heart of hearts, the way the fans cheer for you, the way the city shows love out here,” Gibson said. “You have to. Without saying it, he probably does. But that’s neither here nor there. (Thursday) night, it’s about basketball.”
Williams expects James will be booed and 
heckled, but hopes the fans’ reaction doesn’t go beyond that.
“I understand the frustrations,” he said. 
“I had the same frustrations, but when the results are something violent or the possibil-ity of that, I think that’s outside of basketball and outside of everything we stand for as an organization.” Cavaliers prepared for James’ return

 Dumisane Hlaselo’s first 
weeks at the University of Florida can be best described 
as a culture shock.
During his first six days in the 
states, the South African track run-ner couldn’t eat. The foreign food he was given had a different texture and flavor compared to his mom’s usual cooking back in Johannes-burg. 
As he walked to class in the sum-
mer heat, his body still believed it was seven time zones away. Sleep 
became difficult to manage, and he 
soon started to feel sick.
In his heavily accented English, 
Hlaselo asked himself, “What is go-ing on around me?” and “Why did I come?” 
Finally, at the end of his first 
week in Gainesville this summer, he passed out asleep on campus, 
exhausted from trying to figure out 
how to function in a new land.
It was an adjustment the 21-year-
old never had to make before. He was living in a new country, learn-ing at a new school and dealing with a new way of life. 
The only thing Hlaselo, a junior 
transfer, didn’t have to adjust to was 
the very thing that brought him to 
Gainesville in the first place: run-ning. 
As he tried to get used to a new 
life in America, Hlaselo found sol-ace and success on the fields and 
rolling hills of cross country cours-
es, where he quickly became one of the top runners in the Southeastern Conference. 
In the race, he was right at 
home.
‘Running is Running’
In South Africa, Hlaselo is one 
of the best runners in his age group and a candidate for the 2012 Olym-pics. He holds a South African junior record in the 1,500-meter, made his 
country’s 2008 World Junior Cham-
pionship team and launched his track career with a win at the 2005 Telstra Zatopek Classic, Australia’s biggest annual race.
“At home, they felt great about 
it,” Hlaselo said of his Zatopek vic-tory. “I ran almost the best time by a 16-year-old in South African history . 
It’s something I don’t really know 
how to explain. To South Africa, it was huge.”
His experience overseas helped 
him to immediately carry over his talent to NCAA-level competition in the U.S. Hlaselo stepped into the Gators’ cross country lineup as the team’s top runner despite not hav-
ing any previous experience in the 
longer style of racing. By Novem-ber, he had grabbed three top-10 re-sults and finished as the best Florida men’s runner in each race he’d com-peted in.
“Running is running,” Hlaselo 
said. “It doesn’t matter where you are. If you can run, you can run 
wherever you go.”
The South African ran so well 
this year that he reached the nation-
al championship as an individual after the Gators failed to qualify as a team, breaking Florida’s NCAA drought going back to 2008.
Off the course, Hlaselo’s per -
formances and personality imme-diately endeared him to his team-mates, who began to refer to him as “Dumi.” He also brought an energy and sense of professionalism to his training that helped invigorate the men’s team to its best season in two years.
“I’ve been blessed for my last 
year to be able to train and run with him every day and learn what an elite runner does,” senior James Uthmeier said. “It’s opened my eyes to running and just helped me to ex-cel to a level I didn’t think I could this year.”
Hlaselo became like an adopted 
brother to the men’s team, UF coach Todd Morgan said. Over Thanks-giving break, he was invited to Uth-meier’s home in Destin to spend his first American holiday with the family.
“It was great; he loved it,” Uth-
meier said. “My family enjoyed having him and we had a blast just 
introducing him to American holi-
day traditions.”
Although Hlaselo is fitting in 
well with his team and new friends in America, his thoughts still go back to his mother living in Johan-nesburg. He doesn’t know when he’ll get to see her again with his growing school and training com-
mitments at UF. Maybe in a year; 
maybe when he graduates.
“I’m a student; I cannot leave my 
studies and go to South Africa at the same time,” Hlaselo said. “It’s a long way to South Africa. It’s like a 34-hour flight.”
A Long Way From Home
Even back in South Africa, Hlase-
lo’s quick legs were giving him op-portunities far from home. At 16, he moved from his mother’s home to a boarding school five hours away in 
Bloemfontein. 
The decision to leave was dif-
ficult but necessary . His home life 
was becoming stressful due to his mother’s long hours at work, and he wasn’t getting enough training at his current school. 
The move south would solve 
both of those problems.
But from then until he moved to 
Gainesville, Hlaselo was only able to visit his mother once every three months or so.
Homesickness is a problem most 
of the Gators’ international ath-letes have to deal with frequently, Morgan said. But with athletes on this year’s roster hailing from four 
different continents, sometimes a 
phone call home is the only remedy during a busy season.  
“He still does get homesick a lot, 
and we got him in touch with his mom on the phone,” Uthmeier said. “So he’s able to call home a couple times a week.”
Hlaselo said he always knew 
that one day he would have to leave home for the U.S. in order to make himself into an Olympic-caliber runner. Still, he was hesitant when Morgan offered him a scholarship.The coach first met Hlaselo when 
he was running in the 2008 World Junior Championships in Poland, which Morgan described as the Olympics for runners 19 and under. He had heard of Hlaselo’s wins in 
high school and his record-breaking 
time in the 1,500-meter from friends in South Africa and knew the runner would be a good fit for the Gators. 
After Hlaselo’s race, Morgan told 
him about UF and Gainesville.
“I was like, ‘What is that?’” 
Hlaselo said.
When Hlaselo found out just 
how far Florida was from South Af-rica, he realized it would take a lot to convince his mother to let him go. But after a couple of months and some follow-up e-mails from Mor -
gan, Hlaselo’s mother decided to again let her son go and follow his dreams.
Morgan couldn’t be happier. 
Not only was Hlaselo a great run-ner, he was a great student as well, which would in turn make the dif-ficult NCAA transfer process a little easier. 
But Hlaselo’s recruitment hit a 
speed bump when he missed a cru-cial SAT date.
“It didn’t work out getting him 
as a freshman,” Morgan said. “The NCAA doesn’t care. The same rules for a kid that goes to Gainesville High School are the same for one that goes to school in South Africa, so he had to wait two years and transfer (from a college in Bloem-fontein).”
Adding to the stress of trying to 
get students eligible, coaches like Morgan who recruit foreign players also have to deal with the venom 
some cross country fans have to-
ward bringing foreign runners to American universities. 
Most of the hostility , he thinks, 
is just Internet fodder and jealousy due to the success of international runners lately in the cross country ranks. Five of the last 10 NCAA men’s champions have been inter -
national runners.
“If they don’t like it, they need 
to speed up,” Morgan said of the detractors. “They don’t understand how difficult it is. These kids are earning it, and they’re bettering their lives. I think it’s a great thing and I think, if anything, it makes the U.S. kids that are around better.”
Hlaselo admits he is still work-
ing on making the adjustment to life in the U.S., but he thinks he’ll be fully settled in a couple of months. After finding a South African gro-cery store in Orlando, he’s been able to control his weight, eat the food he likes and sleep better.
With cross country season over, 
he’ll be moving back to the famil-iar, flat surface of the track that he was so dominant on back in South Africa. 
Hlaselo will be back where he is 
comfortable.THURSDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2010 n ALLIGATOR, 19

 AUBURN, Ala. — The NCAA 
has determined that the father of 
Auburn quarterback Cam Newton broke rules by shopping his son to Mississippi State, but that the 
overwhelming Heisman Trophy 
favorite apparently didn’t know 
about it.
  The college sports governing 
body said Wednesday that New-
ton is eligible to play for the No. 2 
Tigers in the Southeastern Confer-
ence championship game against South Carolina on Saturday.
  The NCAA had concluded on 
Monday that a violation of New-
ton’s amateur status had occurred. 
A day later, Auburn declared New-ton ineligible and requested his eli-gibility be reinstated.
  The Heisman front-runner now 
has been cleared to compete with his team a win away from playing for a BCS title.
  “Based on the information 
available to the reinstatement staff 
at this time, we do not have suf-
ﬁ  cient evidence that Cam New-
ton or anyone from Auburn was 
aware of this activity, which led to 
his reinstatement,” Kevin Lennon, 
NCAA vice president for academic 
and membership affairs, said in a news release.  “From a student-athlete rein-
statement perspective, Auburn University met its obligation under NCAA bylaw 14.11.1. Under this threshold, the student-athlete has not participated while ineligible.”
  The NCAA won’t say its case 
is closed on Newton. However, its statement notes that reinstatement likely occurs “prior to the close of an investigation.”
  It’s at least a temporary alle-
viation of fears that Auburn’s 12 wins so far — and any titles won — would wind up being vacated if the NCAA found that Newton had been ineligible because of vio-
lations commit-ted before sign-ing with the Tigers last New 
Year’s Eve.
  The NCAA became involved 
over the summer in investigating the pay-for-play scheme that was discussed during Newton’s re-cruitment. Two Mississippi State boosters have accused Cecil New-ton and former Mississippi State player Kenny Rogers of trying to 
get up to $180,000 for Cam Newton 
to play for the Bulldogs while he 
was being recruited out of junior college last year.
  The NCAA said Wednesday that 
Auburn and NCAA enforcement staff agreed that Newton’s father 
and an owner of a scouting service 
worked together on the scam. The NCAA did not name Rogers.
  Auburn has agreed to limit Ce-
cil Newton’s access to its athletic 
program, and Mississippi State 
has dissociated itself from Kenny 
Rogers, who worked for a sports 
agent.
  “The conduct of Cam Newton’s 
father and the involved individual is unacceptable and has no place in the SEC or in intercollegiate athlet-
ics,” said Mike Slive, Southeastern 
Conference Commissioner. “The 
actions taken by Auburn Universi-
ty and Mississippi State University make it clear this behavior will not 
be tolerated in the SEC.”
  It wasn’t immediately clear 
what access Cecil Newton would 
have at Auburn and school ofﬁ  cials said they would have no immedi-
ate further comment.
  Kenny Rogers’ attorney, Doug 
Zeit, told The Associated Press that 
he had received a letter from Mis-sissippi State on Wednesday morn-
ing stating that Rogers has been 
disassociated from the school.
  “We’re not that surprised,” Zeit 
told the AP . “From what I under-
stand, anything that’s related to 
athletics at Mississippi State, (Rog-
ers) can’t participate.”
  Zeit took issue with the word-
ing of Mississippi State’s letter. The 
attorney said the school’s reason-ing in the letter for dissociating 
itself with his client was because Rogers told the NCAA he made a 
solicitation for a player.
  “Kenny Rogers never made a 
solicitation,” Zeit said. “We never 
told the NCAA that. I want to make that perfectly clear. Cecil Newton asked for the money and then Kenny Rogers passed along 
Newton’s message. That’s what 
happened. Cecil Newton asked for 
the money. Kenny Rogers was the messenger.” 20, ALLIGATOR n  THURSDAY, DECEMBER 2, 2010
