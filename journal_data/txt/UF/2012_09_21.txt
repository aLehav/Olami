 With each carry , Mike Gillislee runs farther 
away from the dangers of DeLand. His cousin 
Kentrell Gillislee, meanwhile, deals with the perils of their hometown every day.
  While Mike leads the Southeastern Confer-
ence in rushing, Kentrell is working at Captain D’s Seafood Restaurant.
  “I have a part-time job, but that’s not what it 
is around here,” Kentrell said. “I can’t stand the area. It gets hard. If you don’t get a scholarship to play football, you have to be an A+ student to get up out of here. Other than that, there’s people around here that sell dope and shoot. It’s not the right place for anybody.”
  An accusation of lewd battery in 2009 ruined 
Kentrell’s shot at a Division I football scholar-ship. After receiving interest from Central Flor-ida, Florida International and Illinois, he settled on a football scholarship to Edward Waters College in Jacksonville, but stayed for just one year.
  The cousins, both 21 years old, played to-
gether at DeLand High. Football has always been part of their bond, back to the days when they would do barefoot imitations of Emmitt Smith in the middle of South Clara Avenue dur-ing their childhood.
  Alfred Smith coached at DeLand from 2002-
2012 and has seen the development of the cous-ins on and off the ﬁ  eld. Smith remembered when he ﬁ  rst saw Mike in the weight room. There was something different about him as a freshman. 
  Football was Mike’s big ticket, and he knew 
it from a young age, Smith said.
  “That kid wanted to get strong,” Smith said. 
“He would come into the weight room and he’d bust his butt. He wouldn’t be going in there laughing and playing with the other kids. He was repping out, waiting and recovering, and went right back to work.”
  Smith served as offensive coordinator when 
Mike and Kentrell ran in the same backﬁ  eld for the Bulldogs. Now he’s the head coach at Cres-cent City High.
  “When kids come out of that area (DeLand) 
and do good for themselves, that whole city supports them,” Smith said. “They know what type of area that is.”
  Last year, Kentrell’s 16-year-old cousin, Cal-
vin Nealy Jr., died from the bullet of another teenager’s gun. Nealy was the second young adult from DeLand  shot between March 20 and April 2 of 2011.
  Through it all, Mike found his way to 
Gainesville, where he’s running with more than just the Gators in mind. 
  “He’s trying to do this not only for himself, 
but for his whole city ,” Smith said. “He’s got a lot of friends he left behind still doing wrong whose only hope is him.”
  On the football ﬁ  eld, Gillislee heads into the 
fourth game of his senior season at Florida with the Gators’ hopes for 2012 largely on his shoul-ders. 
  To this point, he hasn’t disappointed.   Through three games, Gillislee has rushed 
for 346 yards and scored four touchdowns. His yardage total is the highest for any Florida rush-er through a season’s ﬁ  rst three games since Ciatrick Fason gained 396 yards in 2004. Fason was Florida’s last 1,000 yard rusher. 
  Gillislee’s success has been a long time com-
ing for the senior who arrived at Florida as the lone running back in Urban Meyer’s 2009 re-cruiting class.
  During the last three seasons, Gillislee took 
a back seat to speedsters Chris Rainey and Jeff Demps. 
  Injuries also kept Gillislee on the sidelines 
last season. He suffered a sprained ankle against LSU on Oct. 8, which limited the physical run-ner’s carries the rest of the way.
  Prior to this season’s opener against Bowling 
Green, when he ran the football 24 times, Gil-lislee hadn’t received more than 11 carries in a game.
  Although he led the Gators with a 5.9 yards 
per carry average in 2011, he ﬁ  nished with 56 at-tempts — well behind Demps’ 98 and Rainey’s 171. 
  He was also used mostly in garbage time, 
with only two of his 56 attempts coming in the second half with either team down one score or less.
  Although the Gators experienced trouble 
running between the tackles last season, Gil-lislee did not see as much playing time as his high school coordinator felt he should have.
  “I used to give him the ball 30 times a game,” 
Smith said. “Heck yeah, I wanted him to have more playing time, because I knew what he had in him.”
  Florida ﬁ  nished eighth in the SEC in rushing 
last season. Against No. 1 LSU, Gillislee led the Gators with 56 yards. He had the talent, but his downhill running style didn’t ﬁ  t Charlie Weis’ offense.
  “Last year we had those two little fast guys 
that were kind of the same player, so that mini-mized his touches,” Weis said. 
  A struggling Florida offensive line didn’t 
help Gillislee, either.
  “We didn’t block as well as we’re blocking 
right now,” Gators coach Will Muschamp said. “Not taking anything away from Mike, because he’s running really well, but we’re a little dif-ferently equipped in the running game than we were a year ago.” 
  Smith made sure his former player stayed 
focused, even with the public clamoring for Gil-lislee to get in the game. 
  Fans chimed in on Twitter with “#freegilly” 
hashtags and messages pleading for him to touch the football, which still make appearances during Gators game days in 2012.
  “I kept in touch with him, because I knew it 
was tough on him,” Smith said. “He knew he could do it and he knew a lot of people knew he could do it. It seemed like he just wasn’t getting the chance. The only thing I was doing was tell-ing him to be patient.”
  High school teammates took notice of how 
the former four-star recruit handled the lack of playing time.
  “He had to wait his turn,” former DeLand 
center Tim Sandersﬁ  eld said. “A lot of people would’ve transferred, but Mike had his mind on the goal and took whatever it took to get there.”
  With touches rare, Gillislee worked on the 
special teams units during his ﬁ  rst three years at Florida. 
  “He’s a guy that never complains,” Mus-
champ said. “He was on our kickoff return team and our punt block team last year. He never complained. I wish he would talk to some of our freshmen. We’re trying to get them to un-derstand that. He’s a very unselﬁ  sh player and works extremely hard. You come to our prac-tices, and he puts in the work every day . He’s a great example for our younger players.”
  One embattled player in particular has ben-
eﬁ  ted from knowing Gillislee since their days playing pickup at Chisholm Community Cen-ter in DeLand.
  De’Ante “Pop” Saunders is in his second 
year as Florida’s starting safety, but his impact hasn’t always been positive.
  Saunders missed Florida’s game against 
Alabama last October due to a violation of team rules. 
He agreed to deferred prosecution following 
an arrest in May on misdemeanor marijuana possession charges.
  He also missed the ﬁ  rst two games this sea-
son for undisclosed reasons.
  Saunders may have gotten in some trouble 
at Florida, but Gillislee helped the safety land with the Gators in the ﬁ  rst place.
  “He was one of those hot heads,” Kentrell 
said of Saunders. “He looked up to Mike, be-cause [Saunders] was a sophomore playing on varsity . He always asked us questions and we tried to stick with him, because we knew ev-eryone around the city does drugs. We just told him to keep on the right path, because he had the talent, too.”
  Smith added: “Whenever Pop was into some 
crap, we’d be like ‘Hey Mike, you have to go talk to him.’ He’d get right on it. He was like a big brother to Pop.”
  Gillislee looked out for his teammates. When 
Sandersﬁ  eld, who was named the captain of the offensive line in 2008, broke his leg before the season, Gillislee showed his center some love by visiting him.
  “I felt pretty bad,” Sandersﬁ  eld said. “I re-
member Mike coming over the house sitting there playing Xbox with me. Not even talking about football. Just hanging out with me.”
  His selﬂ  ess attitude extended beyond one-
on-one situations.
  “I know Mike was from a low-income area, 
but he always took care of his teammates,” Sandersﬁ  eld said. “I remember going out to dinner and him covering me. He always had that heart about him.” 
  Gillislee didn’t have much. Kentrell can at-
test to that. The cousins would help their grand-father mow lawns just to make an extra buck. 
  Sandersﬁ  eld recalls sitting on the sidelines 
in the midst of DeLand’s 0-10 season, Gillislee’s junior year, when the running back’s work ethic was evident.
  “I didn’t get to play one game and I told Mike 
on the bench, ‘Look man, I never thought it’d be like this,’” Sandersﬁ  eld said. “He looked at me and said, ‘I can’t believe it either, but I know one day it’ll be different.”
  Gillislee’s life on the football ﬁ  eld has 
changed for the better. DeLand went 5-6 his senior season and after three years of sitting on the bench, Gillislee leads the SEC in rushing.
  “I’m glad he’s there (at Florida),” Smith said. 
“I’m glad he’s playing big-time football, be-cause he deserves it. He came up from a rough area and he was never one of those kids who stayed out on the streets. He seemed like he al-ways wanted to do something with it.”

Santa Fe College history student Jeremiah Cleghorn 
carried a sign that read, “We won’t wait for full equal-
ity.” UF alumna Diana Moreno walked a bike with a gi-ant rainbow ﬂ  ag billowing at its rear. Other marchers held balloons decorated with “Queer + Proud” and “Go Gaytors” messages.
Students, faculty members and alumni participated 
Thursday in March Against Hate, a demonstration or-ganized by UF Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Affairs, Pride Student Union and the Gators Coalition for an Inclusive Campus.
The march was a response to last week’s hate crime 
against a UF Levin College of Law professor, said Bridg-et Siegel, Pride president.
“It was something we knew we had to do right 
away,” she said.
About 75 students gathered at Peabody Hall to walk 
through campus chanting, clapping and following a solidarity banner signed by LGBT supporters. 
By the time the march ended on Turlington Plaza, the 
group had amassed more than 100 people.
UF President Bernie Machen left a Board of Trustees 
retreat at Lake Wauburg to speak to members of the march.

For rock group Sister Hazel’s guitar-
ist and vocalist Drew Copeland, tak-
ing the stage at 7:30 p.m. tonight at the Phillips Center for the Performing Arts is not just another gig.
“It’s like a second home to us,” 
Copeland said in a phone interview.
The band’s afﬁ  nity for appearing on 
campus traces back more than 20 years. Four of the ﬁ  ve members were UF students when the band got together, Copeland said.
“We were true ‘Gainesville-ians,’” 
said Copeland, who graduated with a degree in building construction and met his wife at the Swamp Restaurant.
The catalyst for the band’s forma-
tion occurred at a Florida vs. Tennessee tailgate party in 1990, where Copeland was introduced to Ken Block.
Copeland said Block began singing 
a cover of “Peaceful Easy Feeling” by the Eagles, and Copeland accompanied him with acoustic guitar and harmony vocals.
“Ya’ll need to go make some money 
doing that!” bystanders told the duo.
Copeland and Block took the advice. 
This March, the two will have been singing together for 22 years.
The pair played its 
ﬁ  rst show in 1991 at a cafe on Tower Road. They performed as an acoustic duo for three years before adding a bassist, drummer and lead guitarist to form 
the full-ﬂ  edged band Sister Hazel.
The band’s name was inspired by 
Gainesville resident Sister Hazel Wil-liams, who ran a soup kitchen serving the city’s homeless in the ‘90s.
“She was a light lots of people could 
turn to who needed a fresh start,” Sister Hazel performs tonight

West Nile has migrated to Alachua County.
The virus was found in two chickens, the 
city announced Thursday night. While no hu-man cases have been reported, the Alachua County Health Department encourages people to wear bug spray and to drain standing wa-ter.
“The risk of disease transmission to humans 
and animals has increased,” Anthony Dennis, environmental health director of the Alachua County Health Department, wrote in a press release. “Citizens are encouraged to avoid ex-posure to mosquitoes.”
After one person died of the West Nile virus 
in Pensacola Wednesday , 23-year-old graduate student Laura Gorham said she started paying more attention to mosquitos.
“Yeah it’s still ﬁ  ve hours away , but disease 
can spread with a snap of a ﬁ  nger,” she said.
County Disease Control staff member Isabel 
Anasco said the county tests chickens weekly, because the presence of West Nile virus in the birds can indicate the presence of the disease in the community.
Anasco said the county mosquito control 
unit also routinely sprays chemicals to reduce the mosquito population countywide.
She said protecting yourself can be as easy 
as turning over empty ﬂ  owerpots and contain-ers collecting standing water in residential ar-eas, wearing mosquito repellent and avoiding going outdoors at dusk.
The last documented incident of a mosqui-
to-borne illness in Alachua County was dur-ing summer, when a chicken tested positive for Eastern equine encephalitis, according to a press release issued by the Alachua County Health Department July 16.
The symptoms of West Nile are headache, a 
high fever and ﬂ  u-like symptoms, Anasco said. In rare cases, infected people develop neuro-logical symptoms such as memory loss.County health department:

� THE SLOW SUMMER 
MONTHS DIMINISHED THE BUSINESS’ BUDGET.
BRITTANY ANN MORRISEY
Alligator Contributing Writer
Electricity will continue to flow 
through the neon lights of The 
Laboratory thanks to donations from community members.
The bar, at 818 W. University 
Ave., suffered a “horribly wretch-ed” summer that left Larry Bruce, the owner, about $1,500 in debt.
Bruce, 42, said he had budgeted 
for the summer. He knew about the inevitable summer slump when students clear out of Gainesville.
But this summer was slower 
than the past two years, and the electricity bill was higher than usual, he said. His summer budget was gone by May.
“Don’t own a small business 
during a recession,” he joked.
To make up the difference, he 
reached out to patrons for dona-tions and set up an online contri-bution site. Now, he said, he has enough money to pay the electric bill.
“We’ve had such a positive 
feedback from customers and friends,” he said. “There is great sense of community.”
The online donations page has 
since been taken down, because the electric bill has been paid, Bruce said.He said he’s seen several res-
taurants come and go in the area, especially because the block gets skipped over for business when people head to Midtown or down-town.
The bar was still about $600 
short of being fully restocked Wednesday. Some of the money for the electricity bill came out of the money that is set aside for food and beer, Bruce said.
At the start of a fundraiser 
Wednesday night, the bar was al-ready out of food, and had a few eight-packs of beer left. Bruce said he’s making ends meet and plans to host a themed night at the bar Saturday.
Hannah Esty, a 23-year-old San-
ta Fe College theater sophomore, said she’s been a patron of The Lab since it opened in 2010.
She said she’s a big fan of the 
bar’s nachos, which she described as “freaking amazing,” but she said she enjoys the overall atmo-sphere at the bar.
“It’s amazing,” she said. “(It’s) 
one of the only places in Gainesville like it.”
John Stoltz, 22-year-old Santa Fe 
College music sophomore, and his band played at the bar Wednesday night as part of a fundraiser.
He said he loved how the bar 
has so many theme nights with dif-ferent styles of music, such as goth and postpunk music.
“Nowhere else does that,” he 
said.

UF President Bernie Machen speaks at March Against Hate on Turlington 
Plaza on Thursday afternoon. More than 100 students joined the march.
Attendees said progress has been 
made, but there’s more work to do
crime.
“I think it’s good for the community to speak 
up about this so there’s no doubt about where 
we stand,” Machen said later that day. “I just wanted to be there to tell them I was proud of them, I identify with what they’re doing, and I agree with them.”
College of Education graduate student Jess 
Clawson said UF has dealt with more than a cen-tury of discrimination.
“That’s what today is about — the queer stu-
dents not backing down in the face of hostility,” she said.Kim Emery, an associate professor in the Eng-
lish department, spoke soon after, calling last week’s crime cruel and criticizing the white danc-ing couple statue on the Plaza of the Americas.
“Where is our giant statue of black dykes in 
each other’s arms?” she asked the crowd.
After the march, students stood in the plaza, 
blotting sweat from their foreheads, shaking hands, hugging.
“It was great to see so much support from stu-
dents and make something positive out of some-thing so horrible,” said Marla Munro, an LGBT Affairs intern and president of Gators Coalition for an Inclusive Campus.
Clare Walsh, a 52-year-old sociology graduate 
student who’s been at UF for six years, was one of the last to walk away from the march.
“It’s a lot easier to say you’re a queer person 
now than it was even six years ago,” she said. “Progress is being made.”

While Apple fanatics across the globe 
are raving about the release of the iPhone 5, 
there are mixed feelings about its accompa-nying update, iOS 6.
One of  iOS 6’s main features includes changes to maps, such as eliminating Google maps.
Marcus Keyes, an Apple product profes-
sional at the UF Bookstore, said he likes the new Apple map feature.
“iPhone finally has turn-by-turn direc-
tions,” he said.
Catie Nowak, a 19-year-old anthropol-
ogy sophomore, said she owns an iPhone 4 but isn’t too excited about the update.
“I’ve read through all of the specs that 
are noted with the update on my phone, and none of them seem so great to me,” she said. “Everyone who has it is saying it’s so awesome, but I think it’s mainly a bunch of hype like many of Apple’s new products.”Some of iOS 6’s new features are general 
upgrades to Siri, additional Facebook inte-gration and a new YouTube app. 
The new “Do Not Disturb” function 
gives users the ability to schedule specific times to turn off all incoming calls and no-tifications. 
Apple’s iOS 6 is available for download 
for the iPhone 3GS, the iPhone 4 and the iP-hone 4S. It is also available for the fourth and fifth generation iPod touches, as well as the iPad 2 and the third-generation iPad.New iOS 6 update brings new map, ‘Do Not Disturb’ features

The band was named after a nun who fed Gainesville’s hungry
Copeland said.
The impression the nun made on the band outlasted her 
name recognition as time elapsed.
“When we started the band, she was in Haiti,” Copeland 
said. “We didn’t know she was still alive.”
When Williams returned to the U.S., Copeland said she 
noticed her name appearing on billboards. She contacted 
Block and said, “I see my name in all these different places. I think we need to have a talk.”
Once Williams understood how her 
name connected to the band’s music, she gave the OK to rock on.
“We were somebody everybody could 
connect to,” Copeland said. “We had that in common with her. Regardless of race, religion, background, she was accepting of everyone.”
Copeland said life in Gainesville has influenced the 
band’s music as well as his own. He said the song “A Lit-tle Like Heaven” on his 2004 solo album, with lyrics set at Paynes Prairie and Hogtown Creek, points to a deeply per-sonal love for the area.
“There’s always something going on — a feeling of youth 
and regeneration because of the university,” Copeland said. “Gainesville is a very special place.”
The at-home relationship at UF that Copeland said the 
band enjoys is reciprocated by Michael Blachly, director of UF Performing Arts.
“Sister Hazel is my ‘house band,’” Blachly wrote in an 
email. “They’re simply part of Gainesville’s musical DNA.”SiSter hAzeL , from page 1“That’s what today is about — the

Students petitioned for clean 
and green politics on the Plaza 
of the Americas on Thursday , and all they had to do was have their pictures taken.
Neon green signs attracted 
students to stop, fill out a “Pow-er V ote” pledge card and have their pictures taken with signs that read, “I am a voter and I want clean and green politics.”
The pictures will be sent to 
political candidates to show that young voters want clean energy solutions, said Heather Dean, a 21-year-old political science senior and event orga-nizer.
“We want candidates to put 
people over profits,” she said.
Power V ote tries to mobilize 
young voters to build momen-tum toward clean-energy solu-tions and to get “dirty money” from big-spending, polluting corporations out of politics. 
The campaign held its Na-
tional Day of Action on Thurs-day , and UF was one of seven Florida campuses that partici-pated.
“We want to go viral that 
the environment and climate change is a top issue for young voters,” said Cara Cooper. “We want candidates to start ad-dressing it if they want to get our vote.”Cooper, with the Southern 
Energy Network, is working on the “Power V ote” campaign throughout the state. 
V olunteers asked passers-by 
to use social media to contact CNN’s Candy Crowley , who will host the second presiden-tial debate.
“It’s important to tell our 
congressmen and women what young people want, and I like the clean air idea,” said 18-year-old food science and human nutrition freshman Christa Tor -
rence.
Nineteen-year-old Camille 
Mekwinski, an environmental engineering sophomore, filled out a pledge card and peti-tioned with a picture.
“I feel like we owe it to the 
community to give back to it,” she said.

UF’s Board of Trustees discussed how UF’s mission 
relates to the university’s past, present and future at the 
first day of its Fall retreat Thursday.
UF President Bernie Machen acknowledged the Morrill 
Act’s role in establishing UF and addressed the univer -
sity’s U.S. News and World Report rankings. 
The university was recently ranked 54th among the 
best national universities and 17th among the public uni-versities.
The rankings evaluate factors like the 
average freshman retention rate (for UF, 96 percent), the percent of classes with fewer than 20 students (45 for UF) and the student to faculty ratio (21 to 1).
“If you look at the student variables, 
we are right in the mix right now,” Ma-chen said. “It is the resource variables 
where we fall out.”
Machen said the national tuition average is higher than UF’s, and if the university charged a higher rate, more money could be spent on faculty.
“I really think a number of about $30 million recurring 
would put us in a very competitive situation to be in the top tier,” he said.
Provost Joe Glover mentioned how skewed the rank-
ings can be, especially because the numbers are self-re-ported by each university.
“There are lots of little factors that can goose this thing 
up or down,” Glover said.

We were bombarded this week by two things: rain and

the other could actually be relevant to your life as a citizen of this country. Between rain boots, football wins and looming exams, it’s deﬁ  nitely Fall at UF. Don’t forget to study like you should vote: early and often.

Are you really proud of your facial hair, you beard aﬁ  ciona-
dos? Then be careful if you travel to Ohio and ﬁ  nd yourself in 
Amish Country. Members of that society have taken punishment into their own hands. Sixteen men and women are convicted of hate crimes “for a series of hair- and beard-cutting attacks on fellow sect members.” We give a that-probably-hurt-since-they-don’t-use-electricity DART to those not-so-peaceful Amish.
We were so happy to hear this week that Chick-ﬁ  l-A will stop 
donating to anti-gay/anti-marriage equality groups. (Mostly be-cause that means we can eat there again; life isn’t worth living if there’s no wafﬂ  e fries in it.) But now we’re hearing that the com-pany is still donating to fundraisers like “Ride for the Family ,” a bike ride supported by both the WinShape Foundation and the Marriage and Family Foundation. We give a quit-playing-games-with-our-hearts LART (a combination of a dart and a 
laurel) to Chick-ﬁ  l-A. Make up your mind already, jeez.
Meet Valerie Spruill. She was raised by her grandparents in 
Akron, Ohio. She married a man named Percy , and she learned something interesting about him six years after his death. Spruill learned that Percy was her biological father. Even though she heard rumors that he might be her dad, she waited until after he died to run a DNA test. We give a this-only-happens-in-Ohio-we-hope DART to Valerie Spruill. She also has three children 
and eight grandchildren, in case you needed more nightmare fuel.

Lindsay Lohan and Amanda Bynes were in a minor Twit-

Bynes is now, ap-parently, telling friends that Lohan deserved to be arrested be-cause of karma. Quite frankly, if she tweeted something with the word “car-ma,” we might have more respect for her. As it is, neither of these two women should be allowed in public. We give a remember-when-you-used-to-make-good-movies-yeah-neither-do-we DART to Amandsay Lohynes.
Now for your yogurt news of the day: Turns out that long-
term eaters of yogurt also saw a reduced systolic blood pressure and less risk of high blood pressure. Results of the study showed that “31 percent of volunteers were less likely to develop high blood pressure when at least 2 percent of their daily caloric in-take was yogurt, equivalent to at least one six-ounce cup of low-fat yogurt every three days.” We give a good-because-we’ve-only-been-eating-it-for-the-ﬁ  ber LAUREL to yogurt.

Romney’s 47 percent remarks misleading
Of all the seemingly shocking statistics that Conser-vatives love to sputter in defense of their regressive tax policies, their favorite must be that 47 percent of 
Americans pay no federal income tax. Astounding, isn’t it? How can those pinko-commie hippies at Occupy Wall Street complain about tax cuts for the rich, when almost half the nation doesn’t pay taxes?
By now, chances are you’ve seen or heard about the secret 
video taken at a $50,000-a-plate fundraiser for Mitt Romney last May, recently released by Mother Jones magazine, dur-ing which he grumbled to attendees about this very segment of the population:
“There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the 
president no matter what,  who are dependent upon gov-ernment, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who be-lieve that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it … And they will vote for this president no matter what.” 
Uh, seriously?Aside from the fact that Romney blatantly insulted half 
the nation — nice one, Willard — his comment was disingen-uous for the same reason that any mention of this fact by the Right is disingenuous: These almost 147 million citizens, for whom Romney evidently holds such contempt, are actually too poor, too elderly or too young to pay income taxes.
Of the 47 percent who pay no income tax, about half don’t 
earn enough to even qualify for the lowest tax bracket and still pay several other taxes, including payroll taxes, state and local sales taxes, excise or sin taxes, and gas taxes.
The threshold below which a family of four is exempt 
from paying income tax was $26,400 last year, and it goes without saying that the other taxes such a household is re-quired to pay are more than substantial. 
The other half of citizens with no income tax liability con-
sists of households that beneﬁ  t from tax credits for senior citizens, students or the working poor. 
Any time anti-tax conservatives and right-libertarians 
cite the 47 percent statistic, all they’re doing is misleading average middle-class Americans into favoring their brand of deﬁ  cit-exploding supply-side eco-nomics, the cornerstone of which is counterproductive tax cuts for the wealthy.
Despite the fact that businesses 
typically make their decisions based solely on whether those decisions will result in proﬁ  t, sup-ply-siders justify slashing tax rates for the rich by portraying them as 
“job creators,” as if businesses will magically hire new work-ers simply because they’re swimming in money.
If this were the case, we wouldn’t have the unemployment 
crisis we’re experiencing now. Tax cuts for the rich yield only two outcomes: increased income inequality , which is already higher than at any time since the Gilded Age of the late 19th century, and drastic worsening of our budget deﬁ  cit.
Now Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan are running on the 
same supply-side policy positions that have crashed our economy and given rise to a new Gilded Age in which the 400 wealthiest people in the U.S. own more wealth than the bottom half of all Americans combined — more than 150 million people. Of course, a politician is perfectly capable of advocating these ludicrous positions without needlessly bashing more than 140 million Americans.
One would think that after the considerable number of 
blunders Romney has already made on the campaign trail (“Corporations are people, my friend!”), he’d probably want to avoid painting half the nation as blind freeloaders.
But the truth is, he was simply feeding the robber barons 
at the fundraiser exactly what they wanted to hear.
When Romney tells a room of rich individuals they are 
the responsible, productive class while everyone else is a lazy parasite, he’s drawing on decades of right-wing rhetoric meant to dupe working people into voting against their own economic self-interests.
Apparently, this is how Romney aims to win the election. 
Don’t be fooled.

Letter to the Editor
Dear Ryan,
I really enjoyed reading your column in 
the Alligator on Wednesday. Your example 
with the mountain really hits the spot. I have used the same idea in other areas besides re-ligion and agree that various religions are different paths climbing toward the top.
Here is where our opinions differ a bit. 
Agnosticism (nonreligion) and even atheism are paths people follow in their quest for something more noble — with great success I might add. If we modify your example a bit, I think we can get a better idea of what is really going on.
I will not put God on the top of the moun-
tain; I will put the “good” person there.
By “good,” I mean that inherent notion 
that every being carries within. (I know this sounds naive, but I am a mathematician, and my skills with words are limited.) The path will then be our efforts to become that ideal person.Religions help you get there (that should 
be at least part of their agenda), but they are not the only way. I, like you, believe that hu-man beings are not capable of achieving that true noble goal. At least I am not capable of becoming that ideal person, but that is OK. The point is to try to climb up that mountain every day, any way you can. Help others around you, not by showing them the path you are taking, but by promising them that the view from up there is awesome. Help those in need, forgive and ask for forgive-ness when you do something wrong, be-cause you will do something wrong. Help others better themselves, and ultimately, love each other.
I am Thanos Gentimis, I am agnostic and 
I support this message (without the typos and the bad grammar).

Someone I barely know con-
tacted me the other day, and it creeped me out a little bit. I had 
just met her a few days earlier, and she said “Hi” to me on Facebook.
Immediately I thought she was 
crazy.
Ironically , not two weeks before 
this, I sent a Facebook message to someone I had only talked to a few times in person, to share something I thought she would potentially find interesting. A mutual friend told me the next day that the person I had messaged thought it was weird, be-cause I did not normally talk to her.Looking back, I find both situa-
tions hilariously unnecessary.
Despite how they began, each 
led to me and the other person be-coming better friends.
If it makes getting to know some-
one so much more difficult, why do we get creeped out so easily?
When we are not familiar with 
a person, we have no idea what that person’s intentions are. So any time someone we do not know very well wants to talk to us, we are on guard. Naturally we have to protect ourselves from all the lunatics out there. But most of the time when we are weirded out by someone, we have more of a connection than we think.
Feeling iffy about complete 
strangers makes sense; we have no reason to trust their intentions. When the person is someone we know through a friend or talked to at a party, however, we could stand to be more open to communication.
A few days after I was unexpect-
edly messaged by that girl on Face-book, I decided to respond to her. It felt stupid to think she was weird because she said hello.
But responding to her still made me feel a bit uncom-fortable in a way , as if I was not supposed to 
let her talk to me just because she started the conversation. Of course, once we actually started talking more, those feelings went away , and I discovered she was not actu-ally creepy.
Until you’re sure of someone’s 
intentions, they will always seem like they may be slightly creepy . The article “Trust Building Among Strangers,” published in “Manage-ment Science,” stated that being open-minded enough to learn a per -
son’s intentions was the key factor in how much people trusted people they did not know.
We do not have to be friends 
with everyone, but we can miss out on a lot if we are too quick to judge how creepy someone actually is.
Sure, there are actual creeps out 
there, but probably a lot fewer than we let ourselves believe.

� UF POLICE HAS RESPONDED TO FOUR THREATS 
SINCE 2008.
CHRIS ALCANTARA
Alligator Writer
UF police said they are monitoring a string of bomb threats 
that led to mass evacuations at college campuses nationwide 
in the last week.
The University of Texas at Austin and North Dakota State 
University received bomb threats by telephone Sept. 14. School ofﬁ  cials and police ordered thousands of students, faculty and administrators at both colleges to stay away as ofﬁ  cers can-vassed the campuses.
Students and faculty at Hiram College, in northeast Ohio, 
were also forced to evacuate later that day following a bomb threat via email. 
On Monday, Louisiana State University was evacuated af-
ter 911 dispatch received a call from a man who said he had placed multiple bombs on campus. The school shut down for the rest of the day while police searched for the devices.
Students at an Arkansas State University dormitory were 
evacuated Tuesday afternoon following a bomb threat.
Police at the ﬁ  ve institutions did not ﬁ  nd explosives, and 
the incidents do not appear to be related.
Although these bomb threats occurred outside Florida, 
UF — like all institutions — could receive a threat at any mo-ment.
On Aug. 14, two people claimed they hid a bomb on the 
third ﬂ  oor of Shands Hospital for Children at UF, according to Alligator archives. Police traced the call and later arrested the suspects.
In the Spring, there was a bomb threat to the Stephen C. 
O’Connell Center. Police did not ﬁ  nd any devices during the search.
Following UF’s 2009 Homecoming Parade, a maintenance 
worker found an unattended backpack in the Reitz Union loading dock and called police. After a six-hour investigation, police discovered the backpack had been ﬁ  lled with sand and used as a tire wedge.
In 2008, UPD responded to a threat in which someone called 
the Alachua County 911 dispatch and said a bomb would go off in the Florida Gym. After searching for two hours, police did not ﬁ  nd any suspicious materials inside or outside the building.
UPD spokesman Maj. Brad Barber said the department has 
to be prepared for all possibilities. According to Florida law, a bomb threat is a threat to throw, project, place or discharge a destructive device.
Bomb threats are typically made by phone, Barber said. But there have been instances, like at Hiram College, in 
which a bomb threat was made via email.
If a bomb threat of any kind is made to campus, Barber said, 
UPD establishes a site location and assesses a number of factors to verify the credibility of the threat. These factors include time, location, potential target and if there is an event happening.
Once a threat is veriﬁ  ed, UPD updates students and faculty 
members on the situation through the UF Alert system, which includes text messages, emails, tweets and posts on UPD’s website.
“UF Alert system is our primary means of discussing with 
the community what is taking place,” Barber said.
In the updates, police address the incident location as well 
as instructions to either evacuate or avoid the area, depending on each case.
“It is very situationally dependent,” Barber said.Barber said if ofﬁ  cers cannot determine what is inside an 
unattended package, they treat it like a bomb. UPD then calls a bomb disposal team, usually from the Alachua County Sher-iff’s Ofﬁ  ce, to see what is inside.
“We would not put our ofﬁ  cers and/or members of the uni-
versity community in harm’s way when it comes to any kind of suspicious package,” Barber said.
Lt. J.J. Moran, commander of ASO’s Bomb Disposal Team, 
said the team would respond with whatever equipment UPD requested, which could include a robot used to remotely in-spect a potential explosive device.
“We also have additional investigative options that allow 
us to inspect potential suspicious devices while keeping at a safe distance,” Moran wrote in an email.
Depending on the situation, bomb threats on campus can 
suspend classes or daily building operations. Incidents can last for hours until police give an all clear.

Throughout the past few sea-
sons, Gators football fans have 
learned to cope with fumbles, incomplete passes and bad cell-phone reception.
But the situation in the Swamp 
is changing.
UF recently installed a system 
of more than 300 antennas in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium that works to triangulate cellphone signals and pinpoint users’ calls, said John Madey, manager of tele-communications and network infrastructure for UF Informa-tion Technology.
The stadium’s system has fin-
ished installation, but Madey said 
AT&T is still working to improve it.
The Distributed Antenna Sys-
tem improves reception, call qual-ity and data rates within the stadi-um during home football games.
During home games, AT&T en-gineers watch the cellphone traffic and make adjustments in real time to maximize coverage. A syncing issue is currently preventing full optimization, Madey said. 
The project does not cost UF 
anything, Madey said. AT&T is 
providing the funding for the campus-wide project. It was awarded the roughly $15 million contract in May 2011. Leading carriers like Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile are expected to join in next year.
Until then, only AT&T users 
will see the benefits of the new system, Madey said.
The only time the system can 
be accurately tested is during a home football game, and with technical tweaks still to be made, he said it won’t be fully func-tional for another two to three home games.
“Yes, reception is better,” 
Madey said. “But we expect it to get even better.”
Psychology junior Bahar 
Pourshariati noticed the update at the Bowling Green game Sept. 1. 
The 19-year-old was surprised 
when her text message sent suc-cessfully and quickly.
“Reception in the stadium 
had always been so bad,” Pour -
shariati said. “I didn’t expect to be able to text until at least the third quarter.”
According to Elias Eldayrie, 
UF chief information officer, Shands at UF and its neighbor -
ing academic health center is the next phase of the project.
Buildings on campus like the 
Stephen C. O’Connell Center, Reitz Union and Library West are due to install similar systems in the next two years.
“Our goal is to have a mini-
mum of three bars of cellphone service anywhere on campus,” Eldayrie said.

For Florida, the sting of last 
season’s embarrassment against Furman is still fresh. 
On Nov. 19, seven days be-
fore UF was slated to play FSU, 
the Gators fell into an early 15-0 hole against the Paladins, an opponent from the FCS. 
Although Florida eventu-
ally rallied in a 54-32 win, the shame of trailing on home turf as a 29.5-point favorite is re-membered as a low point in a disappointing 7-6 season. 
“We kind of looked past 
Furman, and they came out a great team,” safety Josh Evans said. “But that’s something we’ve definitely been talking about, too. Staying focused. We’re not taking Kentucky light.”
Saturday’s game against the 
Wildcats presents the Gators with a situation similar to last year’s matchup with the Pala-dins.
Again, Florida is at home.Again, UF is a nearly 30-point 
favorite. 
And again, a matchup with 
a highly ranked rival looms on the horizon —  this time a show-down against No. 2 LSU on Oct. 6. 
But this time, the Gators be-
lieve different preparation will lead to a different outcome.
This year, Florida players say 
they won’t let up. History will not repeat itself in The Swamp.
“We’ve just been through 
too much,” offensive guard Jon Halapio said. “We have too much at stake for the amount of work we put in for this sea-son.”
Said coach Will Muschamp: 
“You only have 12 opportuni-ties a year. You need to prepare well and play well, and that’s what we plan on doing.”
Florida has beaten Kentucky 
25 consecutive times. 
The last four of those meet-
ings have been decided by an average margin of 41 points. 
Still, the Gators are intent on 
avoiding overconfidence. 
The formula is simple: prac-
tice hard and treat this week like any other. 
“Whether we’re playing Ken-
tucky or LSU, it doesn’t mat-ter,” nose tackle Omar Hunter 
said. “Go out and practice  the Gator way every 
day.”
On the heels of upset road 
wins against Tennessee and Texas A&M, Florida is looking to keep momentum going in its favor. 
“We’re just going to try to 
go out and play like we’ve been playing,” linebacker Jon Bostic said. 
“We’re not going to let down 
just because we’ve beaten them so many times.”
Saturday’s game precedes 
a bye week, making it the final opportunity before October for Florida to iron out any wrin-kles. 
Despite the 3-0 start, there 
are plenty of areas the Gators want to address. 
Evans said the defense needs

When the Gators take the field this week-
end, they will have to deal with more than 
just a pair of Southeastern Conference ri-vals. 
They’ll have their own emotions to cope 
with as well.
Florida (4-3-1, 1-1 SEC) will square off 
against No. 23 Tennessee on Friday and Georgia on Sunday.
“It’s hard to not let your emotions get the 
best of you,” senior midfielder Erika Tymrak said. “You have to let your technique over -
ride any emotions.”Junior defender Maggie Rodgers said the 
team tries to look at the entire SEC as their rivals, not just Tennessee (6-1-2, 1-0-1 SEC) 
and Georgia (5-3-1, 1-0-1 SEC).
“Playing Auburn, they 
took the SEC tournament title from us last year, and we just come in for the huddle we’re just like, ‘This is revenge,’” Rodgers said. “All SEC teams are our rivals. We treat every 
team like that.”
Florida avenged last season’s loss and de-
feated Auburn 2-1 on Sunday thanks to an overtime goal from junior forward Adriana Leon.
Florida has already played one game 
against a traditional rival – a 1-0 loss to No. 1 Florida State on Aug. 31. 
In that match, the Gators missed several 
opportunities to score, getting shut out de-spite taking 12 shots.
Tennessee comes into Friday’s match 
with Florida after a tiring weekend. The Vol-unteers played in two overtime matches last weekend, winning the first in the 97th min-ute and playing to a two-overtime draw in the second.
Florida played 99 minutes against Au-
burn on Sunday, and have a 2-0-1 record in overtime matches this season. Gators to face pair of SEC rivals this weekendFlorida looks to avoid letdown after key wins

Now, onto the picks…
Leading the pack with a 14-10 record is the Miami Her -
ald’s Matt “I love you, 7F!” Watts, who recently decided a 
flight from Charlotte to Tampa was his opportunity to loudly pronounce his love for an entirely uninterested passenger. Shockingly, she didn’t take the bait. Who can resist a broke sportswriter with an occasional anger problem?
In a four-way tie for second with a 13-11 record is Rivals’ 
Bryan “Winnie the Pooh can’t take my Honey Boo Boo” Holt, whose obsession with TLC’s newest reality show has simply become too much. When asked where the show was filmed earlier this week, Bryan answered “McIntyre, Ga.,” a little too quickly. The South will rise again! Key word: “will.” People like Holt are holding them back.
Next up is alligatorSports writer Adam “I like having 
things in my mouth” Pincus, who recently discovered the snacking joy of sunflower seeds. For Pincus, the trouble is never what’s in his mouth — it’s what comes out. I guess we’re not all equipped with common sense.
Then there’s alligatorSports writer Josh “What the hell is 
Google?” Jurnovoy, who either botched the spelling or com-pletely misfired on just about every name he included in his stories this week. Here’s a hint, Josh: When you see red squig-gly lines everywhere, hit spell check. You’ll be better off for it.
Rounding out second place from the Associated Press is 
Mark “Where my tribesmen at?” Long, who used a break during a recent interview session to identify and tag all the Jewish members of the UF media contingent.  Sorry, Mark, but 
they were never going to invite you to their Rosh Hashanah keg stand.
And tied for dead-ass last with a piss-poor record of 12-12 
is Palm Beach Post writer Jason “Too grown up for the fist bump” Lieser, who coolly turned down a fist bump from Will Muschamp, offering back only an open palm and an unre-lenting glare. The duo engaged in the familiar game of hand-greeting-method-switching roulette we all know too well, with Coach Boom ultimately walking away contact-less after deciding Jason wasn’t worth the time. I mean, the guy doesn’t even know who Mark Bavaro is. Idiot.
Also in dead-ass last with a piss-poor record of 12-12 is 
alligatorSports assistant editor Joe “All I want for Christmas is a pair of glasses” Morgan, who can’t read anything smaller than size-739 font or see anything more than 15 yards away, but doesn’t think this problem needs to be addressed. When you edit a newspaper and watch sports for a living, clearly ‘vision’ isn’t an important skill. Joe’s only hope is that Santa brings him a shiny new pair of spectacles this holiday season, because obviously St. Nick has the  necessary  infrastructure to 
conduct an eye exam and suggest a proper prescription.
Rounding out the three-way tie for dead-ass last with a 
piss-poor record of 12-12 is alligatorSports editor Greg “This is a bad neighborhood!” Luca, who always harps on his pas-sengers to lock the doors of his blue Cobalt when they exit the vehicle. Lock them yourself or get a car with power locks, Luca! Even the most thuggish carjackers take a look at your ride and decide to pass, if only out of pity.14, ALLIGATOR � FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 2012

Wideout Frankie Ham-

Jon Halapio added that 
issues with penalties, con-verting on short-yardage opportunities and offensive alignments all need to be ad-dressed. 
The bye week will give 
the coaches a chance to put together photo and video packages that highlight more areas of concern, but a strong performance on Saturday would cross a few necessary fixes off the list. 
“We need to gel in four 
quarters, all together,” Hala-pio said. 
“We need to come out 
stronger and faster.” 
If they don’t, Saturday’s 
game could turn into anoth-er Furman. 
If they do, the Gators will 
head into the bye week an unscathed 4-0.

The Gators will play in front of 
more than just the usual crowd this weekend. 
More than 20 Florida soccer alum-
ni, including three-time All-American Erin Baxter McCorkle, will be in the stands for Gator Soccer Alumni Week-end.
“It’s definitely cool that alumni

not on coach Becky Burleigh’s mind.

The Gators have had plenty of 
reasons to give up this season, asso-
ciate head coach Dave Boos said.
Instead, Florida heads into Fri-
day night’s Southeastern Conference home opener at 7 against Missouri (10-2, 2-0) with a No. 13 ranking and a perfect SEC record.
Boos said UF (8-2, 2-0 SEC) stayed 
strong amid offseason losses and in-juries because of the leadership of the upperclassmen.
“There’s a lot of reasons for a 
group like this to say, ‘Well, this shouldn’t be our year,’” he said. “This senior group is not letting that happen. This group hasn’t had that mind frame at all from the begin-ning.”
The confidence starts with red-
shirt senior and team captain Betsy Smith. The 6-foot-2 Atlanta product has 56 kills and 18 blocks through 10 matches at middle blocker this sea-son.
But her impact is felt off the court 
as well. 
Smith said she embraces her role 
as a leader for the 11 underclassmen that make up the majority of the team’s roster.
“They do some goofy things,” 
Smith said. 
“I have to put myself back in their 
shoes like, ‘OK, I would have done that four or five years ago — maybe, I guess.’ So it’s just like trying to fig-ure out how they are, who they are as people, and that’s been the fun part.”
Freshman Dana Backlund said 
she has increased her knowledge and love of the game just by watch-ing the older players compete with the same mentality in practices as in games.
“It’s such a big help watching 
them,” she said. “You learn so much in what really needs to be done. So it’s a great learning experience for all of us. They’ve all been great leaders (and) great examples for all of us.”
Boos praised Backlund and the 
rest of the freshman class for being so receptive and ready to follow in the footsteps of UF’s veterans.
He said this attitude has given 
the Gators success thus far, and his team is prepared for the challenges that lie ahead.
“We’re really steady,” Boos said. 
“We’re composed. And from the very first serve you can tell we’re ready to go. You can see the belief happening.”Smith’s leadership keeps UF strong

One of the worst parts of the season is al-
ready in the past for the Gators.
They haven’t played the toughest teams 
on their schedule, and their games haven’t 
had the highest stakes. But Florida came out of one of its tougher two-game road trips in recent memory without a blemish on its re-cord and will only have to play one South-eastern Conference game on the road the rest of the season.
After winning their first two SEC games 
at Texas A&M and Tennessee, the No. 14 Gators (3-0, 2-0 SEC) return home to face Kentucky (1-2) on Saturday at 12:21 p.m.
“It’ll definitely be nice playing at home,” 
said junior offensive lineman Kyle Koehne, who made his first career start at right tackle last Saturday against Tennessee. “Playing in The Swamp is a huge advantage, but yeah, I mean I think it was great training playing in such big stadiums and with such noise. It helps our communication, a bunch of things, and I think it’ll just give us more of an ad-vantage when we play at home.”
For the first time in 20 years, UF has only 
one SEC road game remaining on its sched-ule after three weeks. In 1992, Florida won its opener at home against Kentucky before losing at Tennessee and Mississippi. UF then went on a seven-game winning streak during which the first three games were in The Swamp. The last was Florida’s final con-ference away game, a 41-21 victory against Vanderbilt.
The early road games, while daunting 
when they first appeared on the schedule, have paid dividends for Florida.
“We played two good teams and for our 
kids to go in there and come out with vic-tories, I think there’s a big payoff for that,” offensive coordinator Brent Pease said. “It builds their confidence and makes them take a bigger step of wanting to improve and knowing what the next task at hand is.”
The early road success also provided new 
starting quarterback Jeff Driskel with valu-able experience. His passer rating improved with each contest, he has yet to throw an in-terception and he showed increased pocket awareness against the Volunteers, as he was not sacked after taking eight sacks against the Aggies.
“In both games we expected him to play 
well, and he did,” coach Will Muschamp said. “(He) executed extremely well. I think (he) grew from Week 1 there at A&M to Week 2 there at Tennessee. … I’m sure it’s been a nice shot of confidence for him and, more than anything, the players around him. They’ve played well, but they have now, instead of the uncertainty maybe of how he will play, they know he’s going to play well.”
Pease said Driskel benefitted from his ex-
posure to the hostile environments of Kyle Field and Neyland Stadium. He was forced to make adjustments at the line of scrimmage while dealing with relentless noise from the opposing crowds. Considering he was up to the challenge, making the same play calls at home is not expected to be too difficult.
“He’s keeping us in tempo and he’s get-
ting us going,” Pease said. “We’re getting the ball off. We’re not getting up there and letting the defense get aligned so much and waiting and being able to look and get their cleats in the ground and their eyes to the ball as much. He’s doing it much quicker and our guys are able to react and sometimes, defensively, they’re out of position.”
Florida’s opponent is not riding the same 
high as Saturday approaches. Kentucky fell to 1-2 last week with a 32-31 overtime loss at home to Western Kentucky.
One of the few bright spots this season 
for the Wildcats has been quarterback Max Smith, who leads the SEC with 966 yards passing. He has thrown eight touchdowns and four interceptions. Cornerback Loucheiz Purifoy said the 
secondary is aware of the challenges the Wildcats will present, as well as what the Gators will have to do to handle them. 
“Make plays,” Purifoy said. “Break up 
passes. They’ve got a good passing game. As you can tell, (they) lead the SEC in passing, so I mean, find ways to stop them.”
Purifoy and the rest of the defense should 
have plenty of crowd support on Saturday night. When asked if he feels like the road wins have caused more of a buzz around the team than in years past, safety Josh Evans didn’t hesitate.
“Absolutely,” he said.Contact Josh Jurnovoy at jjurnovoy@alliga-
