  Members of the Students Party recom-
mended the recent Student Senate elections be redone after receiving an investigation re-port.
  The UF Supreme Court Justices ordered 
an investigation by the Election Commission after the justices heard an appeals hearing re-garding the procedures for the fall elections cycle. Elections were held Sept. 27 and 28.
  The Election Commission heard the Stu-
dents Party complaint about the validity of the results before the Supreme Court did. 
The Commissioners recommended the 
Student Senate validate the election results.
  After the Supreme Court assigned the in-
vestigation to the Commission, the Justices approved a list of questions to be answered.
  When Students Party member Jonathan Ossip read the Commission’s report, he thought the questions weren’t answered di-rectly.
  “It was so ﬁ  lled with the excuses of the 
elections staff, it didn’t really even get to the core questions we were asking,” he said.
  He said SG should admit 
there was a problem, move on and hold fair elections.
  Supreme Justice Matt Mi-
chel said that at tonight’s 
meeting, the court will re-view an Election Commis-sion presentation, ask ques-tions, hear the arguments 
from both sides, ask any remaining questions and then make a decision. 
The meeting time and location were not 
available at press time.

ing details.

 UF CLINGING TO HOPE AFTER BLOWOUT

 BATON ROUGE, La. — The 
Gators walked out of Death Valley 
alive. That’s about the only posi-tive you can take away from Sat-urday’s loss.
  After its 41-11 beatdown at 
No. 1 LSU, Florida’s season is on life support. The Gators (4-2, 2-2 Southeastern Conference) are 0-2 this month against a pair of top-ﬁ  ve opponents, and their slate gets only slightly less challenging the rest of October. Florida will travel to Auburn this weekend to take on the No. 24 Tigers.
  UF had not suffered such a one-
sided loss since the 1996 Fiesta Bowl, which Nebraska won 62-24. 
  “Our team just has to get bet-
ter,” linebacker Lerentee McCray said. “Our coaches, collectively, everybody has to get better. That’s basically what we’ve got to do.”
  The Gators didn’t stand much of a chance Saturday. They entered Baton Rouge as 14-point under-dogs, and the Tigers surpassed the odds makers’ expectations by the beginning of the second quarter.
  On LSU’s second play from 
scrimmage, quarterback Jarrett Lee hooked up with Rueben Ran-dle for a 46-yard touchdown. The next drive, the Tigers ran the ball on seven of eight plays, carrying it 57 yards and punching it in with a 2-yard run by Spencer Ware.
  That became a theme through-
out the afternoon for Florida’s de-fense: an inability to stop the run, and a penchant for getting beat deep. 
  The Tigers ran the ball 49 times 
for 238 yards. Florida’s run de-fense, which earlier this season looked to be the team’s strength after allowing an average of 56.5 yards in its ﬁ  rst four games, has become porous as of late. The Gators drop out of Top

  Krishna Lunch, which served 
its first plates of food at UF nearly 
40 years ago, has begun offering a credit card payment option to cus-tomers in response to student de-mand.
  Carl Woodham, chaplain of the 
Krishna House on Northwest 14th Street, said that supplying a card reader to patrons is also an attempt to offset a roughly 20 percent de-crease in turnout over the past two years. He attributes the drop to UF’s request for Krishna Lunch to relocate from along Newell Drive to Plaza of the Americas.
  “We tried doing it by hand two 
or three years ago,” he said of of-fering a card payment system to Krishna Lunch customers, “but it was just ungainly.”

As Florida lawmakers try to 
rein in state spending in a financial 
atmosphere still showing signs of a recession, high school students applying for Bright Futures may find it more difficult to earn the scholarship than past graduating classes. 
The Florida State Legislature, 
in the wake of ongoing debates about the program’s drain on the state’s budget, has implemented its proposal to increase the base-line requirements for high school seniors applying for the scholar -
ship.
Students are also required to 
submit a Free Application for Fed-eral Student Aid (FAFSA) prior to scholarship disbursement, even if they are not applying for any grants, scholarships or awards other than Bright Futures.  
Ninety-seven percent of in-
state freshmen at UF receive Bright Futures, said Rick Wilder, interim director for the Office of Student Financial Affairs.
Wilder said at the latest pro-
jections for the 2010-2011 year, $77,498,667 in Bright Futures scholarships had been disbursed to 26,292 students at UF. He said that number represented 74 per -
cent of in-state undergraduate students. 
High-school students graduat-
ing this spring will be the first to apply for the Bright Futures schol-arship with the program’s new, higher requirements. 
The Florida Department of 
Education has outlined changes to Bright Futures, which will in-crease annually, through the 2013-2014 school year. 
All three award levels have an 
increased community service re-quirement. 
The Florida Academic Scholars 
award requirement has increased from 75 to 100 community service hours. 
The Florida Medallion Scholars 
and Florida Gold Seal Vocational Scholars awards, for which there have been no community service requirements previously, will now require 75 and 30 community ser -
vice hours, respectively. 
Students in the high school 
graduating class of 2011 and be-fore had to earn an SAT score of 970 or an ACT score of 20 to re-ceive the Florida Medallion Schol-ars award, also formerly known as the 75-percent-tuition award.
To receive the same award this 
year, students must achieve a 980 on the SAT or a 21 on the ACT. 
There will be no academic re-
quirement changes to the Florida Academic Scholars award until the 2012-2013 school year, when the required baseline SAT score will increase from 1270 to 1280. 
The following year, the re-
quired SAT score will increase an additional 10 points and the required ACT score will increase one point, from 28 to 29. 
Requirements for receiving the 
Florida Medallion Scholars award will also increase annually after this year, with students being re-quired to achieve a 1020 on the SAT or a 22 on the ACT during 2012-2013. 
The following year the require-
ments will increase by 30 points on the SAT and one point on the ACT.
Bright Futures isn’t the only fi-
nancial aid program being altered.  
Federal Pell Grants have been re-duced, and some grants, such as the Academic Competitiveness Grant and the National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent (SMART) Grant, have been eliminated. 
According to a recent Alliga-
tor article, grants and scholarship programs at UF were cut by $20 million in the 2011-2012 school year.
During the 2010-2011 school 
year, Wilder said the university disbursed $238,931,590 in loans. 
The total amount of financial 
aid UF disbursed in the 2010-2011 school year was $540,117,519.
Because Bright Futures is merit-
based, not need-based, Wilder said it’s impossible to calculate how many students are dependent on the scholarship to pay for tuition; a portion of the students who take Bright Futures would still be able to pay tuition out of pocket. 
Others would have to take 
loans or register for fewer credit hours per semester to balance the cost.
Wilder said he doesn’t know 
exactly what would happen if the Bright Futures scholarship pro-gram were to disappear, but elimi-nating the $77 million that funded expenses for students would cer -
tainly have a major impact.   
“It’s not chump change,” he 
said. “It would be a pretty big blow to me [if I were a student]. That’s a lot of money to lose.” 
Lou Gilman, the College As-
sistance Program adviser at South Dade Senior High School in Homestead, Fla., said her last two graduating classes were more concerned than earlier graduating classes about what they could do to finance their educations. 
Since 2008, her students, like 
the rest of the United States, have been bombarded with news of the recession. 
Although high-school students 
are usually somewhat oblivious to the cost of college, she said, she’s seen them become more fearful of the idea that someday Bright Fu-tures may not exist. 
Gilman said she’s making her 
students aware of the changes to Bright Futures requirements and encouraging them to seek private scholarships to offset the cost of college tuition.
The new requirements’ impact 
on students, she said, is “huge, and it’s going to be huge across the state.” 
She noted that the increase in 
community service hours required for both the Florida Academic Scholar and Florida Medallion Scholar awards will be particu-larly problematic. 
Students in socioeconomically 
disadvantaged communities who have to work to help their families financially may not have 75 to 100 community service hours to give between working and keeping their grades up, she said. 
Although she said she thinks 
community service is invaluable, the increase could keep a portion of hardworking students from receiving the top Bright Futures award. 
In addition to encouraging 
them to apply for as many schol-arships as possible, Gilman said she encourages her students to register to vote. Being informed about representatives’ platforms on policies such as Bright Futures gets the students involved on a visceral level, she said, because legislators are making decisions that directly affect the students. 
“I’ve given up on waiting for 
adults to change the world,” Gil-man said.4, ALLIGATOR §  MONDAY, OCTOBER 10, 2011

About 25 students from UF Libertarians 
and the Gainesville chapter of Students for a 
Democratic Society protested the wars in Af-ghanistan and Iraq on the Plaza of the Ameri-cas on Friday.
The protest was held for the 10-year anni-
versary of the invasion of Afghanistan.
A 15-foot-long display made up of seven 
wood planks arranged on the lawn read “743,917 killed by the war.”
“We want to remind people of the human 
cost of the war,” said William Tew, 21, presi-dent of UF Libertarians and a classical studies senior.
The protesters set up a table where stu-
dents could learn more about UF Libertarians and register to be on the group’s listserv.
The group distributed more than 1,000 fli-
ers with statistics on the cost of the war.
The UF Libertarians have been working on 
this project since the beginning of the semes-ter. They received a $250 protest grant from the national organization Students for Liberty, Tew said.
This was not the first protest against the 
war in Afghanistan that has been held on cam-pus. A protest was held by students on the eighth and ninth anniversaries of the war in Afghanistan. 
Art history sophomore Michela Marti-
nazzi, 19, is a lead organizer for SDS and was involved with the ninth-anniversary protest, which featured students holding anti-war signs and various speakers on issues related to the war. 
“[A protest] is a different tactic but still a 
very good one to get the message across,” Martinazzi said.
The UF Libertarian officers came up with 
the idea for the protest this past summer. They were inspired by “national debt clock” pro-tests done by other chapters of Young Ameri-cans for Liberty , Tew said. In these protests, the United States’ $14 trillion debt was displayed. Some displays were up to 40 feet long. 
To prepare, students obtained a permit to 
protest, painted the 34th Street wall and post-ed  fliers on campus, said 19-year-old John Brandli, vice president of UF Libertarians and a computer science sophomore.
The UF Libertarians are planning a meet-
ing to watch “Cold Murder,” a WikiLeaks video that relates to this cause for students who are interested in more information.  
Tew encouraged students who want to make a difference to attend the group’s upcoming events and “put pressure” on their politicians.
“I hope that [students will] wake up to 
what is happening and be spurred in who they support politically ,” Tew said.

Dejeon Cain has heard 
about the 2 a.m. drunk rush.
As a police service techni-
cian for the University Police 
Department, he’s heard about the migration of drunken 20-somethings down Uni-versity Avenue when down-town and midtown bars shut their doors.
He wants the city to let 
bars and clubs stay open un-til 4 a.m. but stop serving li-quor at 2 a.m. 
To change that situation 
and other issues he’s seen around the city, he’s running for the Gainesville City Com-mission At-Large 1 seat. He’s one of six candidates.
“We’re a college town — 
our students need things to do,” said Cain, 27. “We want to make sure they have time to sober up.”
Born and raised in 
Gainesville, Cain graduated from Gainesville High School in 2003. 
He was a member of the 
Gainesville Police Explorers, a youth program run by the Gainesville Police Depart-ment, from 14 to 21. 
He said he put in thou-
sands of hours as a security guard for the Medieval Hog-getowne Faire and was a member of the Black on Black Crime Task Force. He was a sergeant by 16 
and UPD employee by 23.
Now he spends his time at 
the Health Science Center as a security guard.
However, he said he wants 
to do more to guard the city.
If elected, he said he 
wants to extend UPD’s Stu-dent Nighttime Auxiliary Pa-trol, better known as SNAP, to the apartment complexes on Archer Road.
He said he wants to 
give other utilities compa-nies, such as Clay Electric, the chance to operate in Gainesville, rather than allow Gainesville Regional Utilities to “monopolize” the city. 
He said he thinks that 
change would help grow Gainesville’s economy.
He also said he wants to 
reinstate a warning system for residents who forget to pay their utilities bills. He’d like to see someone from the utility company call residents to remind them about the bills before residents’ power or water are shut off.
“People appreciated that,” 
he said. “And I’d like to see that come back.”
When he talks about why 
he decided to launch his cam-paign despite a lack of politi-cal experience, he leans for -
ward in his chair. He smiles, and his round cheeks rise.
“I’m a city man. I’m a man 
of God. I’m for people,” he said. “I’m just so excited, and nothing can steal my joy.”
A red, white and blue star 
was stitched onto his navy blue polo.
He said he’s searching for 
campaign volunteers and is already planning for Election Day. 
On that day, he said, he 
wants to take two vans and drive around the city picking up voters who wouldn’t oth-erwise be able to make it to the polls.
He said he’s been thinking 
and praying about running for more than two years.
“I’ve just been watching, 
watching things,” Cain said. “To run for office, you have to be humble. … And you have to be ready to take on the issues for the people.”
He said he doesn’t think 
the current commission al-ways makes decisions that the citizens agree with.
He said he wants to be 
“that voice that can talk but also act.”
“I’m an everyday citizen. I 
ain’t someone who’s a politi-cian,” he said. “I’m ready.” MONDAY, OCTOBER 10, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 5

Mandatory minimums 
don’t always fit crimes 
A couple of decades ago, Congress mandated that, in 
most drug-related convictions, the defendant must receive a minimum sentence for possession of the 
drug, usually depending upon weight and type of drug. 
This wonderful example of drug-war injustice is com-
monly referred to as “mandatory minimums.” 
Originally, mandatory minimums were applied to traf-
ficking offenses but were later expanded to include posses-sion for personal use. 
Mandatory minimums are often decried for their influ-
ence on racial disparity among prison populations. 
Before this year, a person found with 5 grams of crack 
(around 10 doses) was given the same mandatory mini-mum of 5 years in prison as someone found with 500 grams of cocaine powder (thousands of doses). 
Studies show that crack is disproportionately used by 
African-Americans than by whites, who commonly use co-caine powder. Although the racist motivations of lawmak-ers can be speculated, one can clearly see that mandatory minimums put more African-Americans behind bars. 
Yet, simple possession of other drugs such as metham-
phetamine and heroin is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum one-year sentence. Many would say that meth-amphetamine is more dangerous that crack, but backward drug policy places a higher burden on those who possess the latter – mostly minorities. 
This summer, the 1 to 100 ratio was recently dropped to 
a 1 to 18 ratio. This means that the same sentence will be given to someone who has 5 grams of crack compared to 90 grams of cocaine powder. 
Coupled with the problem of racial disparity is the 
problem of arbitrary, bureaucratic rules putting non-vio-lent drug users behind bars. 
Why is there such a need for a one-size-fits-all drug 
policy? 
Shouldn’t every ruling and subsequent sentence be de-
termined by the facts of each individual case? 
Someone found wielding a crowbar while in possession 
of crack certainly deserves more scrutiny than someone us-ing crack in the privacy of their own home. Yet, these ar -
chaic laws treat these offenders as one and the same. 
Mandatory minimums are just one example of a host of 
symptoms contributing to the overcrowding of our pris-ons. 
The United States makes up about 5 percent of the 
world’s population but has more prisoners than China, which makes up over one sixth of the world’s population. 
Judges should be able to use their knowledge of the law 
and the facts of each case to determine an appropriate sen-tence for the defendant. 
They should not be reliant upon an arbitrary sentence 
determined by lawmakers in Washington, D.C., who know nothing about the case but somehow think they are helping by putting more non-violent offenders behind bars.Why I am no longer liberal-minded
In a recent response column to my piece on Social 
Security, the writer suggested that I came from a wealthy background and loved to walk all over the 
poor to get ahead. 
I thought it would be helpful to discuss how I went 
from being a door-to-door campaigner for the Obama campaign to actively writing against the policies of the Obama administration. 
Conventional wisdom says that you become more 
liberal in college, and while that is true for me in the 
social sense, I had the opposite experience in my politi-cal worldview. 
I grew up in a family that was middle-class but not 
comfortably so. My dad was a middle school teacher, and my mom stayed at home to raise me and my broth-ers. In Pensacola, Democrat is kind of a dirty word in some circles. Countless jokes were made about my fam-ily’s party affiliation. 
I went to rallies to increase teacher pay with my dad, 
and I went to the local campaign headquarters of John Kerry, where people yelled obscenities at me from their cars as they drove by. I was about as liberal as they come in the Florida Panhandle.
Upon coming to college, I supported raising taxes on 
the rich, protecting labor unions and expanding social programs. Then, I switched majors and started taking economics classes, and that is when my world began to crumble. 
I learned about how labor unions are sometimes like 
monopolies, taxes generate deadweight loss and gov-ernment programs often keep the poor mired in pover -
ty. Furthermore, I met some “millionaires” and realized they weren’t different from me except for a few zeros in their bank accounts. 
After seeing my activity and service fees spent by SG 
on HBO actors and a utility bill from GRU that exceeds what my parents pay for their inefficient two-story wooden house, I began to wonder whether I might be able to spend my money better than public officials. 
I started to wonder what right these officials had to spend people’s money beyond the core functions of govern-ment like police, fire, roads and national defense.   
Another blow to my “pro-
gressivism” came after hearing one of the four-square players on Turlington brag about how he was able to qualify for an unemployment check that he 
didn’t need. Another friend mentioned he got a big-ger tax credit from his work at a grocery store than he earned in hourly wages. I watched as my little brother received a check from Social Security because our dad was over 65. 
People all around me responded to incentives cre-
ated by my government, which rewards behavior that robs the economy of growth and, thus, jobs. 
One of the most shocking graphs I’ve ever seen is 
from Harvard economist Gregory Mankiw’s blog. It shows that the marginal tax rate for workers making be-tween $0 and $40,000 a year is 100 percent as every new dollar of earnings is negated by a loss of $1 in benefits. 
Our government is responsible for creating a pov-
erty trap where the impoverished are discouraged from fighting to rise up out of their condition. 
Looking back on my childhood, I began to see that 
the teachers union that kept my dad’s wages the same as other less-effective teachers contributed more to his lack of pay than anything. 
Taxation was not a zero-sum game where the econo-
my would grow no matter what we did to the wealthy. Morally, I decided that it doesn’t matter whether the rich have a lower marginal utility to their spending be-cause I simply don’t have a right to their money. 
It is wrong to take what is not yours, whether from 
theft or through the ballot box. 
That is why I’m no longer a liberal. Travis Hornsby is a statistics and economics senior at

Columnists were right to 
defend vegetarian lifestyle
In response to Greg Al-
lard’s reply (“Thirty Years Lat-
er, Becoming Vegetarian ‘Best Decision’ of Life,” 4 Oct. 2011) to Sami Main’s article (“Veg-etarian Options Should Not Be Feared,” 4 Oct. 2011), I would like to send high praise to both Allard and Main for speaking out about the benefits of a veg-an diet. 
Modern medical studies 
have proven that meat is un-questionably linked to heart disease, strokes, multiple types of cancer (including co-lon, prostate, bladder, ovarian and breast cancer) and many other diseases. 
The American Dietetic As-
sociation and the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine are just two of the many leading health organi-zations now urging everyone to adopt vegetarian or vegan diets.  
Billions of animals are 
killed in the most barbaric of ways for profit in the meat in-dustry. 
It has been scientifically 
proven that these animals feel pain and suffer, just as we do. 
Yet chickens have their 
beaks barbarically cut off when they are only a few days old, piglets are castrated and have their teeth cut off, and cows are skinned and dismembered, often while still conscious.
All of this is done just so 
that we can eat their flesh, when we’d actually be healthi-er if we didn’t. 
Thankfully, with so many 
delicious and cruelty-free foods, such as vegan barbecue riblets and vegan pizza avail-able at most grocery stores, and with chain restaurants like Denny’s and Ruby Tues-day adding delicious vegetar -
ian and vegan dishes to their menus, it’s never been easier to boycott this kind of cruelty.

It has almost become axiomatic that terrorism does not stem from re-
ligious doctrine. Rather, the violence espoused by Muslim militants or preachers such as Anwar al-Awlaki remains rooted in political 
frustration.
Al-Awlaki’s espousal of committing violent acts against the United 
States caught some ears, not surprisingly. That probably confounded many of us; but instead of considering them pathological animals lack-ing all humanity, we should try to find out what drives people to such destructive behavior. French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre described terrorism as a “terrible weapon, but the oppressed poor have no oth-ers.”
We should try to understand and enlighten ourselves, in the spirit 
of Socrates, Jesus, Voltaire and Jefferson, in the spirit of critical thought, and in the spirit of social justice, to what caused al-Awlaki and others like him to resort to terrorism. 
If you had to guess, how many young Americans do you think 
would take up arms against Mexico if those Aztecs invaded us? Mil-lions, probably. Out of those millions, how many would resort to some dirty tactics, such as suicide bombing, to ensure the eviction of those unwanted Mexicans off of freedom-loving American soil? As Michael Scheuer, the former head of the CIA Bin Laden Issue Station, wrote, “it’s American foreign policy that enrages Osama and al-Qaida, not American culture and society.”
There is great irony that comes with calling these people terrorists. 
Sure, they’re terrorists. But do you honestly think that the millions of victims of belligerent U.S. foreign policy  — particularly in the Middle 
East — don’t consider our troops to be terrorists?
Jesus, the greatest ethicist for many Americans, said in the Gospel 
of John, “He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at 
her.” It is easy — so easy, in fact, that Jesus would perhaps have accused us of hypocrisy in the first degree — if we, chugging out editorials on our Macs while in the United States of America, condemn al-Awlaki for spreading a message of violence and hate.
What about our invasions in Afghanistan and Iraq? Do you honestly think that the widows and orphans of those be-sieged countries don’t consider our leaders of being sponsors of state-terrorism? Before we argue that al-Awlaki’s death was necessary, shouldn’t we ask ourselves and our intellectu-
als: Has our government acted on any higher moral grounds than the terrorists? 
Introspection will result in one interesting observation: We only call 
it “terrorism” when the weapon of choice is some ridiculous and pathet-ic tactic, e.g. suicide bombing. But when state actors are involved, using 21st-century military toys, e.g. Unmanned Air Drones, F-35 fighter jets, we call it “counter-terrorism” in brilliant Orwellian doublespeak.
Jurisprudentially speaking, in an age where many are proponents of 
removing the blindfold from Lady Justice so she can be partial against those “terrorist fools,” it’s obvious that the killing of al-Awlaki was a blatant violation of both U.S. and international law. Assassinating an individual instead of trying him in a court of law is indicative of a na-tion suffering a moral decline. Both the American Civil Liberties Union and Center for Constitutional Rights harshly condemned the extrajudi-cial killing of al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen.
Some have advanced the argument that since al-Awlaki was a trai-
tor, his citizenship couldn’t help him legally. But the imbecility of such a contention is exposed when one takes a look at the specific require-ment of due process mentioned in Article III, Section 3 of our sacred Constitution: “No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.”
It is known that the Obama administration has a secret memo (is-
sued by the Department of Justice) that apparently justifies targeting U.S. citizens accused of terrorism. Snippets of this memo have been revealed, citing absurd or vague legal standards. To prevent further embarrassment, it only makes sense that the administration has kept it classified.

Speaking Out
At a Congressional Black Caucus gala in 
September, President Obama exhorted his supporters to “stop complaining, 
stop grumbling, stop crying.” Obama was right to call liberals out for their armchair petu-lance. The president’s CBC speech, along with his futile campaign for the American Jobs Act, amounted to a desperate effort to galvanize lib-erals for 2012, and that such an effort is neces-sary for a president who has overseen the great-est advancement of liberal legislation since the Great Society is simply baffling.
This summer, in a New York Times tan-
trum that has since become a canonical text for querulous liberals, Emory psychologist Drew Westen asked, “What happened to Obama?” Perhaps the more pertinent question, however, is, “What happened to Obama supporters?”
Some degree of liberal disenchantment was 
inevitable. Idealistic insurgency of the sort em-bodied by Obama ’08 will always out-inspire reaffirmation of the status quo, which Obama ‘12 would have represented even if he had by now enacted every plank of the Democratic platform and was presiding over full employ-ment to boot. Furthermore, liberals are vindi-cable in their umbrage at Obama’s specific in-discretions on civil liberties and gay marriage. But the sweeping degree of liberal discontent is just pathetic, for their disappointment in the president’s foreseeable inability to meet their comically inflated expectations is a direct con-sequence of their naive belief in his ability to meet them in the first place.
Obama cannot be 
faulted for this grossly fantastical outlook that his campaign engendered; presidential can-didates customarily promise the moon to get elected, be they John McCain vowing a bal-anced budget by 2012 or Michele Bachmann guaranteeing $2-per-gallon gas. Responsibility for any ensuing disillusionment, therefore, rests exclusively with those guileless enough to par -
take of the snake oil peddled by pander-prone politicians.
Liberals often lament the lost opportunity 
for a second New Deal, but how they expected Obama to achieve with a seven-point popular mandate, 60 Senate Democrats and 255 House Democrats what Roosevelt achieved with an 18-point popular mandate, 76 Senate Demo-crats and 334 House Democrats, they never ex-plain. In spite of this disadvantage, Obama was still able achieve what Roosevelt couldn’t: uni-versal health care. But rather than exult in this historic achievement, liberals chose to sulk over the comparative triviality of the public option.
Liberals also elide in their analysis the mod-
eration of Obama’s electoral coalition, 63 per -
cent of whom identified as moderate or conser -
vative. Could it be that some of those 63 percent desired not another New Deal but, rather, the post-partisan conciliation that Obama prom-ised? 
By directing their ire at Obama for the fail-
ure to undo in two years forty years of con-servative governance with majorities smaller than either Roosevelt’s or Lyndon B. Johnson’s, liberals implicitly pooh-pooh the role of the op-position party , whose uniform truculence has endowed them with unprecedented leverage in spite of their minority status. How was Obama to counter promiscuous parliamentary obstruc-tion, lock-step legislative opposition, Fox News propaganda, Tea Party vitriol, Koch cash and the suicidal determination of the Republican Party to destroy him at all costs? Simple, say liberals: Use the bully pulpit.
By invoking the specious mythology of the 
bully pulpit, liberals blind themselves to the re-ality of their plight and their own culpability . It is not Obama’s poor communication skills that have resulted in the nation’s sharp right turn. No, by devoting so much energy to attacking the president from the left and blaming his lack of leadership for their demobilization rather than mobilizing themselves, liberals have es-sentially left Obama alone in the fight against the Republicans. And in a battle between left and right in which the left attacks the left and the right attacks the left, who do they expect to win?

UWire� TEN TEAMS COMPETED IN THE 
MATCHES BEHIND SOUTHWEST REC.
CARTER LYLES
Alligator Contributing Writer
Prateek Gahoi took his place in front of the 
wicket, eyed the fielders circling the pitch and 
took a good, long look in the eyes of the bowl-er before raising his bat to swing.
From Friday to Sunday , the Gator Cricket 
Club held its third-annual tournament on campus at the practice soccer fields behind Southwest Recreation Center. Led by club president Vijay Pappu, a former professional cricket player, and faculty representative Rich-ard Hill, the tournament featured members from the campus cricket club as well as play-ers from Gainesville and surrounding areas.
Cricket is like baseball with no foul zones, 
only two bases and two batsmen acting partly as offensive players and partly as goalies. 
Begun by the English in the 1500s, cricket 
has since developed a greater international following, especially in countries such as India and Pakistan.
The cricket tournament in Gainesville is 
held in the summer, fall and spring semes-ters, Pappu said. Last fall, only eight teams participated, but 10 participated this fall.  
By the start of the first round of matches at 6 p.m. Friday, the players numbered just shy of 100.
“Some of those teams have Americans 
playing on them who are playing for the first time,” Pappu said. “It’s definitely growing.”
Kicking off the start of the tourna-
ment was Pappu’s team, Gators 11, and a new group of recruits called the Or -
ange Gators. Matches featuring the Hur -ricanes, the Blue Gators, the Khiladis and the White Gators were held simultaneously.  
Many of the participants were either members or affiliates of the Gator Cricket Club, and some shared a common homeland.“It’s mostly the Asian countries, like India 
or Pakistan, that love it like this,” Pappu said. “This year, though, we were able to attract some West Indians and some Australians.”
Members of the Gator Cricket Club hail 
from all over, from India and Pakistan to the Caribbean, England and South Africa. 
Hill, the club’s faculty representative, add-
ed that the club’s representatives also shared in that pattern of diversity.
“They called me about a year ago to (the 
position),” said Hill, a native of the United Kingdom. “Before that, they had an Australian doing it, so we all take turns.”
As the matches continued throughout the 
weekend, more and more family members and friends of the Gator Cricket Club arrived. 
A young father pointed out a distant player 
to his son, who began asking questions about the game. 
A relative of another player called out 
“Great one, boy!” along with the rest of the team as the batsman knocked the ball outside the field boundaries. 
And at the end of the tournament, when 
the winning Gators 11 players accepted their trophy , it was less about the victory for them and more about why, as Gators 11 player Ga-hoi put it, they get together to play cricket at all.
“We bond together. We have a team feel-
ing, same as we had in India,” Gahoi said. “It’s a great feeling being able to play cricket here. It reminds me of home, and it’s great to be able to have that here at UF.”
dent requests, Gainesville Plan-
ning Board Chairman Bob Cohen proposed reintroducing the card payment option using a card reader and an iPad connected to the Veri-zon Wireless 3G network.
Woodham said student response 
to the new credit card system, in-troduced Aug. 22, has ranged from appreciation to surprise and even amusement.
“It’s worked out better than we 
expected,” he said, estimating that nearly 30 percent of customers cur -
rently use the new credit card op-tion.
Woodham said the goal of Krish-
na Lunch is to provide an afford-able, nutritious and convenient veg-etarian meal option for students.
“This just adds another dimen-
sion of convenience,” he said.
To cover processing costs, card-
holders are assessed an 11-cent ser -
vice fee, bringing the total cost of a Krishna Lunch meal to $4.11.
Woodham said the Krishna 
House receives no real profit from Krishna Lunch because about 95 percent of earnings go back into food purchases while the majority of the leftover funds are used to re-place equipment.
“It’s truly a labor of love,” he 
said.
Krishna Lunch serves vegetarian 
meals at UF’s Plaza of the Americas Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. and currently ac-cepts all major credit cards.8, ALLIGATOR §  MONDAY, OCTOBER 10, 2011

It may not be the Cannes Film 
Festival, but Gainesville residents 
will soon have the chance to claim their place in the world of indepen-dent filmmaking.
The “3 Day Film Challenge” 
gives contestants three days to write, direct and edit a short film before it is judged by a panel of experts. The challenge will be held from Jan. 13 to 16. The screenings, open to the public, will be the fol-lowing week.
The creators and hosts of the 
event, Elliott Doolittle, 24, an audio production graduate of the Inter -
national Academy of Design and Technology in Tampa, and Lane Abraben, 24, a UF graduate stu-dent in agricultural economics, an-nounced the contest today.
The Gainesville natives decided 
to host the contest after Doolittle competed in a similar event in Tam-pa, “The 48 Hour Film Project.” 
“It would be really cool to have 
that in Gainesville, but why do it through them? Why not just start my own?” Doolittle said.
He said he enjoyed the contest, 
but there were too many require-ments, so he and Abraben applied only two to their competition.
“The only reason we are stick-ing with requirements is so they can’t turn in something they have already made,” Doolittle said. “You can’t trust everybody. There has to be something they have to work in that has an element of surprise. But we want them to be as broad as possible.”
Other than the two require-
ments, which will be announced the first day of the contest, there are no restrictions on the subject matter of the film, as long as no obscenity or pornography is involved. 
Other rules and regulations, in-cluding a seven-minute time limit, parental consent for participants under 18 and submission guidelines can be found at www.the3dayfilm-challenge.com.
Teams will be required to pay  
$145 to enter the competition. There is no limit on the number of team members.
Prizes will be awarded after 
the screening of the films, where a panel of judges will choose a win-ning film. A viewer’s choice award and subcategory winners will also be announced.

BATON ROUGE, La. — Af-
ter the Gators got punched in the 
mouth, they shot themselves in the foot.
LSU opened the game Saturday 
with a 46-yard touchdown on its second play from scrimmage. Flor -
ida responded with eight penalties for 61 yards in the first half. 
In all, the Gators racked up 12 
flags for 90 yards in the 41-11 loss and are now the most penalized team in the nation.  
“The penalties killed us in the 
game,” UF coach Will Muschamp said.
In the first quarter, Chris Rain-
ey’s 25-yard run into LSU territory was called back to the UF 40 after a personal foul call on tight end A.C. Leonard. 
Well behind the play, near the 
line of scrimmage, Leonard leveled a LSU defender from the blindside.“There’s aggressive penalties, 
and there’s penalties that shouldn’t happen,” Muschamp said. 
“We’ve got a 30-yard run in the 
first quarter and we’re blocking behind the ball, 20 yards behind the ball. That’s not very smart. It’s something that’s been talked about 100 times. It needs to be talked about 200. So we’re going to talk about 200 times this week.”
Muschamp talked about a lack 
of discipline after the loss, and that proved true in the calls. Nearly all of the Gators’ penalties were pro-cedural, including seven for false starts or jumping offside.
After an LSU field goal made the 
score 17-0, Florida was penalized for a block in the back and holding on consecutive plays. 
Under pressure on first-and-22, 
Jacoby Brissett threw an ill-advised deep pass that was intercepted by LSU safety Brandon Taylor.
The flags helped stall multiple 
drives for the Gators and also ex-tend drives for LSU.
“[Penalties] killed us, man, they 
killed us,” said sophomore Trey Florida now nation’s 
most penalized team

BATON ROUGE, La. — The 
Gators’ defense only saw 14 passes 
Saturday afternoon. That was still more than it could handle.
While LSU dominated with its 
methodical running attack, the Tigers were able to break Saturday’s 41-11 win open with deep passes and other explosive plays. On six of LSU’s sev-en scoring drives, Florida gave up a play of 20 yards or longer.
LSU opened the scoring on its sec-
ond play from scrimmage. After fak-ing a handoff, quarterback Jarrett Lee connected with Rueben Randle for a 46-yard touchdown; sophomore cor -
nerback Cody Riggs was beat on the play.Lee and fellow Tigers quarterback 
Jordan Jefferson combined to go 10 of 14 for 215 yards, the second-most passing yards allowed by the Gators this season. Tennessee quarterback Tyler Bray gained 288 yards against Florida on Sept. 17, but he did so with 48 attempts — about nine less yards per pass play than LSU gained.
“We tried to load up the box in the 
run game, and we gave up some big plays,” coach Will Muschamp said.

A kneeling Taylor Unroe swung at the 
ball and connected, keeping the play alive.
Then, senior outside hitter Stephanie 
Ferrell disposed of LSU’s retaliation with a 
kill, putting No. 13 Florida up 24-23 in the second set.
An attack error by the Tigers (11-6, 4-3 
Southeastern Conference) on the next play sealed the most challenging set of the day for the Gators, who cruised to a surpris-ing 3-0 (25-16, 25-23, 25-8) win against SEC West leader LSU on Sunday in the O’Connell Center.
“Of all the players on our team, [Unroe 
would] be the one I’d have confidence she could make that play,” coach Mary Wise said. “Taylor’s got such game to her.”
The domination of the defensive-
minded Tigers, who rank third in the SEC with 15.63 digs per set, stemmed from the Gators’ back-court effort, which was led by Unroe.
“Our goal was just to come out and 
match [LSU’s defensive energy],” Unroe said. 
“It turns out we’re a lot scrappier and 
we’re a great defensive team.”
After recording just six 
digs in Friday’s 3-0 (25-21, 25-20, 29-27) victory against Arkansas (11-7, 3-4 SEC), Unroe upped her total to a team-best 16 against the Tigers on Sun-day.
“She took some extra 
reps [Saturday],” Wise 
said. 
“(She) felt like she left some digs on the 
court Friday night and asked for some ex-tra work — she brought that work ethic.Unroe, backcourt help Gators

388 total votesits first two series, the Florida de-
fense appeared to force a three-and-out. But on fourth-and-15, punter Brad Wing ran unscathed down the left sideline for a 44-yard gain, setting LSU up at UF’s 23 yard line after an unsports-manlike conduct penalty nulli-fied the would-be touchdown.
Two members of Florida’s 
punt-return unit were supposed to be watching Wing, but they ran back to set up a wall too soon, Muschamp said.
“We had two guys assigned to 
do their job; they didn’t do it,” he said. “They did what they want-ed to do, and those guys aren’t going to play in our program anymore.”
The Gators appeared to gain 
some momentum at the end of the third, when quarterback Ja-coby Brissett hooked up with An-dre Debose for a 65-yard touch-down to cut the Tigers’ lead to 27-11. But, on the ensuing drive, Jefferson hit Randle on a fly route for a 57-yard gain to take the ball down to the UF 3-yard line.
Freshman cornerback Marcus 
Roberson was covering Randle on the play. No Florida defensive backs were made available to the media after the game.
“Everyone just has to just 
do their own job and not worry about trying to be a hero,” de-fensive tackle Jaye Howard said. “We just have to do our own job and things like that won’t hap-pen.”
Linebacker Lerentee McCray said the defense simply missed assignments, giving LSU easy, back-breaking plays.
Asked if, in the sixth game of 
the season, he was shocked Flor -ida was still having such defen-sive breakdowns, McCray said, “I’m not really surprised.”

Brad Wing’s fake punt in the first quarter. Trailing 
14-0, Florida’s defense stopped LSU. The Tigers took a delay of game, then punted, but had to re-kick following another penalty. On the replay, Florida’s punt return unit turned its back to Wing, who decided to abort the punt and streak down the sideline, setting up LSU’s third score.

played poorly, Bostic had a career day against the Tigers. The junior linebacker made a career-high 13 tackles and recorded his team-leading third sack of the season. He also leads the Gators in tackles.

Richardson has 
been a key cog in an Alabama offense that relies heavily on its running game. He’s been the 
beneﬁ  ciary of solid line play but has also earned the tough gains, churning out two or three extra yards after contact on every carry. Alabama rolled Vanderbilt 34-0 last weekend, with Richardson earning 107 yards and a touch-down on the ground.
Mathieu has made a name 
for himself as a ball-hawk this season, with four forced fumbles and a pair of interceptions in six games. He has returned two of those fumbles for touchdowns. 
He recorded six tackles and an interception in LSU’s 41-11 thumping of Florida.Grifﬁ  n no longer has more touchdowns than 
incompletions, a stat that was very popular through the ﬁ  rst three weeks, but he’s still put up a stellar season. On top of his huge passing numbers, he has proven to be an effective threat on the ground, rushing for 107 yards and a score as Baylor notched a 
49-26 win against Iowa State.With the ﬁ  rst pick in the NFL Draft… Luck 
continues to support claims that he’s locked in as the NCAA’s top NFL pros-pect. He may not have the gaudy num-bers of some other quarterbacks, but nobody has played better. His efﬁ  cient 
26-of-33, 370-yard performance helped Stanford cruise to a 48-7 win Saturday over Colorado.

HEISMAN WATCH
*The number in parentheses next to 
each name indicates how many points 
each candidate received from the alligatorSports columnists.Howard attributes flags 
to youth, inexperience
Burton, who played both running back 
and quarterback. 
“They gave them good field posi-
tion all the time and kept us from good field position. It’s something we’ve got to work on and get fixed — real soon.”
Instead of correcting the mistakes at 
halftime, Florida’s penalty woes con-tinued in the second half. 
Left guard Dan Wenger was called 
for a false start on the first offensive play of the third quarter for Florida, helping create yet another three-and-out. 
On the Tigers’ next drive, corner -
back Jaylen Watkins was flagged for a face mask, which helped LSU escape bad field position and start a scoring drive. 
Later in the series, with LSU in-
side the red zone, defensive tackles Jaye Howard and Dominique Eas-ley jumped offsides on back-to-back plays. 
Howard said the team doesn’t suf-
fer from a lack of discipline, attribut-ing the penalties to youth and inexpe-rience.
“We’re going through some grow-
ing pains right now,” he said.
The 12 penalties are not the highest 
number this season, as Florida com-mitted 16 against Tennessee on Sept. 17. Flags have been a concern since the opener, when the team had nine against FAU and then nine again the next week against UAB. 
On the year, UF has 55 for 425 yards 
— an average of 9.2 per game, which trails only Florida State for worst in the country. 
In games against Kentucky and 
Alabama, it appeared the flags were a thing of the past as Florida accumulat-ed just nine in the two games, includ-ing just four against the Crimson Tide. 
Entering Saturday, the Gators were 
117th in the nation in number of penal-ties, trailing only Louisiana-Lafayette (44), Western Michigan (45) and Colo-rado (48).
They are now last. “All I seen out there was penalties,” 
senior running back Chris Rainey said.
Linebacker Lerentee McCray said 
they were “a big factor” in the loss. 
“It’s a part of football. Every sin-
gle play it could be critical,” he said. “Everything is critical in the football game.”

Trey Burton
sophomore running backGators have given up 464 rushing yards the 
last two weeks.
“We’ve got to come up with some ways 
to stop the run game better than we’re doing at this point, and that’s been disappointing because I did think we would play the fronts better,” coach Will Muschamp said. “But we hadn’t tackled well when we’ve gotten the ball on the perimeter in some spots. It’s just a collective effort.”
Florida’s defensive backs, meanwhile, 
were exposed whenever LSU felt like throw-ing the ball. On 14 pass plays, the Tigers gained 215 yards.
Florida’s offense, meanwhile, could not 
find a rhythm with freshman quarterback Jacoby Brissett making his debut. Playing in front of 93,022 fans, the Gators managed just 213 total yards.With an ankle injury keeping John Brant-
ley out, the question of the week revolved around who would be fielding snaps for the Gators. Freshman Jeff Driskel was expected to start, but he too was hampered by an ankle injury suffered toward the end of the Alabama game.
Brantley was using crutches on the side-
lines Saturday, and Muschamp — who has been guarded with all injury information — all but guaranteed Brantley won’t play this week. Driskel’s status remains uncertain.
Regardless of which freshman was taking 
snaps Saturday, Florida would have run a vanilla offense. The Gators kept things sim-ple, hoping to beat the Tigers with a strong running attack to make Brissett’s life easier. No such luck.
For the second week in a row, Florida’s 
offensive line was pushed back. The Gators managed 113 yards on 32 carries, but most of those yards came from the Wildcat for-mation, when Florida at times switched to a run-only offense.
Passing the ball, Brissett elected for safe 
throws early. In the first quarter, he com-
pleted 5 of 6 passes for 5 total yards. He took more chances as the game wore on, and the results were predictable for a fresh-man — a flash of brilliance 
sandwiched between de-flating turnovers.
Brissett threw a pair of 
interceptions, the latter coming on a fourth-quarter deep ball to Andre Debose. But on a similar play in the third, Brissett found Debose for a 65-yard touchdown pass, cut-ting LSU’s lead to 16 after a two-point con-version. Any hope for a comeback, however, was squashed on LSU’s ensuing drive. The Tigers reached the Gators’ 3-yard 
line on a 57-yard pass to Randle. The dagger came about a minute later. 
Lining up in the shotgun, Jordan Jeffer-
son ran forward, an apparent sneak. He then pulled up and left the ground, lofting the ball to a wide-open Mitch Joseph in the end zone. The jump pass.
When Florida debuted that play with 
Tim Tebow in 2006, it did so in a win against LSU. 
Defensive tackle Jaye Howard thinks the 
play came from Tigers receivers coach and passing game coordinator Billy Gonzales, who left Florida on bad terms after the 2009 season.
“That was tough that they did it against 
us,” Howard said. “I looked at Billy G on the sideline and he was laughing.”
Nobody on the other sideline was.Contact Tyler Jett at tjett@alligator.org. MONDAY, OCTOBER 10, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 15
SOCCER
JOSH JURNOVOY
Alligator Writer
 
The Gators’ leading scorer took a game off from 
filling the stat sheet Sunday, but their second lead-
ing scorer did that and more.
Freshman Annie Speese was involved in three 
goals as No. 11 Florida (12-3, 5-1 Southeastern Conference) beat Alabama (6-6-2, 1-4-1 SEC) 4-1 to cap off an undefeated four-game homestand.
The Gators tied the game at one in the 39th 
minute on Speese’s sixth goal of the season.  
After Crimson Tide goalkeeper and Canadian 
national team member Justine Bernier blocked a shot from senior midfielder Lindsay Thompson, sophomore midfielder Taylor Travis ran the ball down just outside the right side of the box.  She played the ball across the box through Thomp-son’s legs to Speese, who fired it past a diving Bernier from 8 yards out.
“It was just a very good goal,” Travis said.  
“When you get a rhythm like that, not many teams can stop it, and we’re fortunate enough to have good personnel that can do that.”
Speese showed her toughness in the 50th min-
ute after a Maggie Rodgers throw-in hit her in the face and gave her a bloody nose. Rather than im-mediately coming out of the game, Speese played on, and in the next minute, she headed a cross that was saved by Bernier.
“The only concern I had was that the ref would 
call me for having blood on my jersey,” Speese said.
In the 56th minute, Crimson Tide forward Pia 
Rijskijk fired a shot from 40 yards out that was saved by a diving Taylor Burke, who had come into the game to replace senior goalie Brooke Chancey at the beginning of the second half.
After Alabama followed that shot with two cor -
ner kicks, Florida forward Erika Tymrak reentered the game after starting the half on the bench.  It was the first game this season where the Gators scored at least three goals without Tymrak notch-ing a point, but her presence was felt immediately as the chances began to mount with four shots in the next 10 minutes.
UF took the lead in the 71st minute when center 
back Kat Williamson played a long ball from the Florida defensive third all the way into its attack-ing third.  Freshman forward Jillian Graff flicked it over Bernier’s head and into the net from 17 yards away for the first goal of her career.
“It was a great feeling,” Graff said of her first 
goal. “I’ve been trying to score it for a while.”
Two minutes later, an Alabama hand ball gave 
Florida a free kick from just outside the penalty box.  Speese took the shot and buried it past Berni-er in the top right corner of the net.
Speese said the ball was placed in the same 
place she takes free kicks from in practice.
“They had a huge wall and I knew it would be 
hard for her to see,” Speese said.
“I didn’t try and kill it or anything like that.  I 
just knew that placement was all that mattered.”Speese propels UF to 4-1 victory

“It was just a very good goal. When you 
get a rhythm like that, not many teams 
can stop it, and we’re fortunate enough to 
have good personnel that can do that.”

Redshirt freshman libero Taylor Unroe (55) was one of eight Gators to record a dig  in 
Sunday’s sweep of LSU. Florida had 18 more digs than the defensive-minded Tigers. 
Florida out-digs LSU by 18 
“She saw the game from a defensive 
standpoint the way she sees it in terms of 
serve-receive.”
Eight players recorded digs for the 
Gators (13-3, 6-1 SEC) against the Tigers, giving Florida a 52-34 advantage in that category.
One of those Gators was freshman de-
fensive specialist Madison Monserez, who has become a staple in the UF backcourt this season.
Monserez chalked up eight digs against 
the Tigers on Sunday.
“Maddie’s always scrappy,” Unroe 
said. 
“She’s a great person to play with in the 
back row when Steph’s not in, and she’s just everywhere.”
Monserez’s role on the team has been in 
a rotation with Ferrell. 
The freshman usually comes in on 
defense to sub in for the former Hawaii standout.Ferrell’s specialty remains offense, 
which Wise has described as “streaky” in the past.
The Los Angeles native started the 
weekend on the wrong foot, recording just five kills and hitting .050 against the Ra-zorbacks on Friday.
However, Ferrell’s effort against LSU 
was dramatically improved.
She hit .375, recorded 
three digs and tied se-nior outside hitter Kristy Jaeckel for the team lead with 11 kills.
“When she swings, 
she swings with no fear,” Wise said.
Ferrell twisted her an-
kle when landing after a kill late in the sec-ond set, but she chose to stay in the game. 
She played through the rest of the match 
with no further problems.
“It was more so a scare play for me,” 
Ferrell said. 
“I’ve had a lot of history with this ankle, 
but it’s better — I’ll be fine.”VOLLEY , from page 13

Coming into his first colle-
giate meet, freshman Matt Elliott 
wasn’t sure what to expect.
“I’ve been practicing really 
hard and I’ve been feeling pretty good, but I still wasn’t sure how I would do,” Elliott said.
After a stunning weekend 
performance that included three individual wins and another sec-ond-place finish at the All-Florida Invitational, Elliott has a better idea of where he stands.
Elliott opened his college ca-reer with a second-place result in the 200 individual medley (1:48.75) on Friday, emerged vic-torious in the 400 IM (3:50.96) and the 100 breaststroke (55.64) on Saturday and capped his week-end with a dominant win in the 200 breaststroke (1:59.06), defeat-ing freshman teammate Eduardo Solaeche by nearly five seconds.
“I like to race, and my team-
mates have been pushing me this year, so it was a lot of fun to go out there and battle and come out on top in a couple,” Elliott said.
Three other Gators men took 
home victories on Sunday: soph-omores Connor Signorin, Brad deBorde, and Marcin Cieslak. Signorin won the 200 backstroke (1:48.87), deBorde triumphed in the 100 freestyle (45.03) and Cie-slak came away with a win in the 200 fly (1:47.31).
To fill in some of the holes that 
he saw in the squad, coach Gregg Troy made it clear earlier in the 
week he was hop-ing for standout 
performances on the women’s side by untested swimmers. 
“We’re going to have to get 
some improvements from last year’s sophomore class and de-pend on some freshman,” Troy said last week. 
He may have found a freshman 
ready to fill some of those holes in Rebecca Rainer. In her first col-legiate meet Rainer finished sec-ond in the 400 IM (4:19.20) and third in the 100 breaststroke on Saturday(1:04.04), and on Sun-day she won the 200 breaststroke (2:14.86). 
Sunday’s win was a particu-
larly impressive performance be-cause Rainer took down sopho-more teammate Elizabeth Beisel, who is considered to be the best swimmer in her class.
Although she finished behind Rainer in the 200 breaststroke, Beisel won an event herself on Sunday, taking home the gruel-ing 1,650-meter freestyle.
The other Florida victories 
came from senior leaders Teresa Crippen and Sarah Bateman. 
Crippen won the 200 back-
stroke (1:57.32) and the 200 fly (1:58.54), while Bateman took home the 100 freestyle (50.06).
Although the Florida men and 
women swept away the competi-tion in the All-Florida Invitation-al, they will face a much stiffer opponent when they face off with LSU in the O’Connell Center on Saturday.
