  Gator Growl staff an-
nounced Sunday that Joel 
McHale will perform on Nov. 4 as the comedian for Gator Growl 2011.
  McHale hosts “The Soup” 
on E! News and appears as Jeff Winger on NBC’s “Com-munity.” 
  Gator Growl is paying 
McHale $85,000 for his appear-ance. 
  Gator Growl producer Aar-
on Heger said McHale scored well on student and alumni surveys, and his fee is within 
the desired price range.
  “We were 
very ex-
cited to see the positive feedback he got,” Heger said.
  Come-
dians are an annual tradition at Gator Growl. Last year, co-median Aziz Ansari of NBC’s “Parks and Recreation” was paid $100,000 for his appear-ance, and stand-up comic Kev-in Hart was paid $50,000.
  Gator Growl will take place 
on Nov. 4 in Ben Hill Grifﬁ  n Stadium. 
Student tickets cost $15, 
and general admission tickets are $25. The price of all tickets increases by $5 during home-coming week.

   They may not all remember it, but UF stu-
dents turned out in droves Friday night to cel-
ebrate the end of the ﬁ  rst week of school and the promise of many more weekends to come.
  Lines snaked out of almost every bar in mid-
town. 
Summer’s dry spell ended with the night 101 
Cantina’s general manager Erik Zika called the bar’s “second best night ever in history.”
  Gator City saw about a 25-percent increase in its crowd from the summer, according to as-sistant manager TJ Brown.
  “We’ve been ready for the start of fall,” 
Brown said.
  Gainesville Police did some reassigning to 
manage the increased numbers of people on the streets.  GPD Lt. Rob Koelher said although the num-
ber of police ofﬁ  cers on duty remains constant, many ofﬁ  cers were shufﬂ  ed around to create a larger presence downtown and in midtown.
  “We try to be very visible,” he said.  During a series of alcohol-compliance checks 
Friday night, GPD ofﬁ  cers arrested nine servers at nine different establishments for giving alco-hol to minors.

  Faculty at UF earned about 
$619 million in research awards 
for 2011, an 8.7-percent decrease from 2010.
  The drop in funding comes 
partly from a decrease in stimu-lus funds. In 2010, UF received $77 million through the Ameri-can Recovery and Reinvest-ment Act, according to an Aug. 25 press release. This year, the school received about $51 mil-lion.
  However, two departments 
at UF received more funding in 2011 than they did in 2010.
  The Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences set re-cords with almost $127 million in funding, a 25-percent increase from last year.
  The College of Liberal Arts 
and Sciences received 9 percent more than it did in 2010, bring-ing awards to $45.9 million.
  “It is especially gratifying to 
see our faculty winning more research awards when compe-tition is getting more and more intense,”  CLAS Dean Paul D’Anieri said in the press re-lease. 
  The U.S. Department of Agri-
culture awarded $64.3 million to UF this year.

Escaped bees create a buzz at KY 
truck stop 
REIDLAND, Ky. — An escape 
at a western Kentucky truck stop 
caused quite a buzz for motorists.
A swarm of honeybees being 
transported from North Dakota to Florida for pollination flew off at the Southern Pride Truck Stop in Reidland on Thursday, according to WPSD-TV in Paducah.
Video of the bees showed 
them flying around and congre-gating on concrete posts at the truck stop.
Alan Watkins, who has 
worked at a neighboring tire re-pair shop for five years, described the situation as “comical” as peo-ple walked across the parking lot “swatting and getting stung.”
Watkins says he saw “a really 
big pile of bees out there, about a million bees” as the truck pulled away.
Officials say a beekeeper re-
turned a short time after the es-cape and rounded up many of the bees.

Pa. school district backs off on 
skinny jeans ban 
CATASAUQUA, Pa. — Stu-
dents in a Pennsylvania school 
district have gotten approval to remain fashion forward.
The Morning Call of Allen-
town reports that Catasauqua (cat-uh-SOCK’-wuh) Area School District approved a revised dress code this week. It allows students to wear so-called skinny jeans.
The tight-fitting jeans had been 
banned under an earlier dress code. But parents complained they were having a hard time find-ing jeans that wouldn’t be banned under the district’s definition.
Board member Patricia Snyder 
tells The Morning Call the district was trying to prevent students from wearing suggestive cloth-ing. But ultimately the district determined jeans could be skinny but still appropriate.
The board also gave in to re-
quests to back off a ban on hood-ed sweat shirts. Low-cut tops, leggings and ripped pants are still barred.

  UF may have fallen this year in its 
party school ranking, but according to 
the Princeton Review, it has improved its position in at least one other category . 
  A survey of more than 122,000 stu-
dents at 376 colleges found UF to have the best career services, according to the Princeton Review website.
  That’s an improvement from last 
year, said Heather White, interim direc-tor of UF’s Career Resource Center. The same survey for last year ranked UF’s career services at No. 4.
  UF spokesman Steve Orlando said 
the ranking is a testament to the uni-versity’s ability to create employable people.
  “We are proud that [the CRC] were 
recognized for something we already 
knew about — that they’re the best,” Or-
lando said.
  UF was also 
ranked No. 9 in The Wall Street Journal’s Top 25 Recruiter Picks, according to the newspaper’s website.
  The CRC saw about 7,000 students 
in face-to-face sessions and about 4,600 in online sessions last year, White said in an email. That’s a 39 percent increase from the previous year.
  She said she invites employers to 
train her staff and talk to students about what employers are looking for.
  The professionals give students in-
sight directly from their industries, mak-ing their experiences tangible, White said. 
  Junior journalism major Ryan Pal-
ermo said he remembers turning to the CRC when it came time to make a ré-sumé two years ago.
  He said he learned about the CRC in 
his Warrington Welcome class. 
  He used the center’s template when 
he had to make a résumé for class and later when he was applying for a writing position.
  “The CRC’s résumé template is some-
thing that I’ve carried with me through freshman year until now,” he said.  UF takes top spot in career services

  While Hurricane Irene surged across the East Coast this 
weekend, students in Gainesville took advantage of sunny blue skies at Ginnie Springs. 
  Employees at the campground said the possibility of a 
storm didn’t keep students away from the fresh water.
  “When the weather is extreme, we’ll shut down,” said 
Zack Woolfrey, an employee at the springs. “But we’re pretty much in the middle of Florida, so we don’t get hit by storms as often.” 
      Ariel Kimball, a supervisor at the park, said attendance 
over the weekend appeared normal.
  With its network of seven freshwater springs spread over 
200 acres of land, it’s not a matter of if students will come back, but when, Woolfrey said. 
  Tubing is appealing to vacationers, families and students alike because of the scenery and relaxation, he said.
  The park can see up to 3,000 visitors on weekends.  “Even on slow weekends, we see about 1,000 people,” he 
said. 
  Vacationers don’t just come from surrounding areas, ei-
ther. 
  “The underwater cave systems are among the most in-
tricate in the world, and we have visitors from all over the world,” he said.
  Attendance will remain steady as long as the weather is 
warm  , and the staff is anticipating big numbers on Labor Day.    Ginnie Springs busy despite weather  Ranking up from last year

employee at the springsmoney this year. Most of that funding went 
to IFAS. The award included the first part of a $20 million, five-year grant to improve the Southeast’s pine forest management.
UF’s College of Engineering was award-
ed $66 million, and the Health Science Cen-ter’s six colleges received $323.5 million. All other colleges were given a combined $56.1 million.
Janine Sikes, director of public affairs at 
UF, said  while the school’s administration understands less stimulus funding is avail-able, research can be the foundation for UF’s future success. Some administrators agree with Sikes. 
Win Phillips, UF’s vice president for re-
search, said in the press release that university re-search is still making a dif-ference, despite the drop in research funding.
“The research our fac-
ulty pursues results in new knowledge, technologies 
and treatments,” he said.  
Emphasis on research is nothing new for UF, which is regarded as a Tier One re-search university.
“Graduate research is part of who we 
are,” Sikes said. MONDAY, AUGUST 29, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 5

Nine bars caught serving minors
Pit, Bonefish Grill, Fresco Neighborhood Ital-
ian, Club Liquid, Rolls ‘n Bowls and TooJay’s Gourmet Deli.
Police sent an undercover, underage patron 
into the venues to attempt to purchase alcohol. 
The employees who served the alcohol to 
the minors were charged on the scene and face a maximum penalty of 60 days in jail and a $500 fine. 
According to a Gainesville city ordinance 
passed in April 2009, bars and restaurants are subject to 90 days of probation if they incur re-peated underage-drinking violations during a business quarter.
During these 90 days, the bars must deny 
entry to anyone under the age of 21 from 9 p.m. to close.
Venues with a capacity of less than 201 are 
penalized after five infractions. 
Larger venues are penalized after 10. In 2010, both The Swamp Restaurant and 
101 Cantina were subject to a 90-day probation period as a result of such infractions.

Keri Pappas walked into the Student 
Health Care Center Pharmacy on Friday 
afternoon to pick up her prescription al-lergy medicine. 
The senior theater major walked out 
with her pills and a bottle of SPF 50 sun-screen.
Pappas took advantage of renovations 
made to the pharmacy over the summer that created room for a mini store for over-the-counter health and beauty products.  
The SHCC is located at 1 Fletcher Drive. 
The pharmacy counter was pushed 
back to allow room for everything from Advil and Airborne to umbrellas and travel-sized deodorant. 
“I was pleasantly surprised when I 
walked in,” she said. “It’s pretty conve-nient. Now I can look around and shop while I wait.”
The six-week renovation process be-
gan in July and was finished Aug. 21.
The store was open for business last 
Monday, just in time for the first day of classes.“We felt like there were a lot of stu-
dents who didn’t know we had over-the-counter items available because we kept them behind the counter,” said Laura Tipton, the pharmacy manager. “We felt it was kind of a disservice to them.”
In addition to toothpaste, face wash 
and lotion, there is also a section with items like light bulbs, toilet paper and aluminum foil.
Tipton said the pharmacy was sure 
to include travel-sized items to cater to students who fly home for breaks.
The construction project cost about 
$30,000 and was funded by the SHCC.
The pharmacy is open from 8 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and from noon to 4 p.m. on Sunday . 
“We’re just trying to meet the stu-
dents’ needs better,” Tipton said.

Bratty adults don’t 
belong in courtroom
An attempted lawsuit out of Illinois involving two adults 
and their mother is taking the phrase “spoiled little rich kid” to a whole new level. 
Steven Miner, 23, and Kathryn Miner, 20, with the help of 
their father, attorney Steven A. Miner, brought a suit in 2009, seeking more than $50,000 from their mother, Kimberly Garrity, for “emotional distress.” 
The case reached an Illinois appeals court last week, where 
the case was dismissed. The court did not find any of the moth-er’s conduct in question to be “extreme or outrageous.” 
Not so, say the poor, distressed victims of this alleged child 
abuse. Well, poor does not qualify as a proper adjective, consid-ering they grew up in a $1.5-million home. 
But, surely, they must have been quite “distressed” by their 
mother’s actions. 
What sort of mother tells her son to buckle his seatbelt when 
he is 7 years old? Or calls her daughter to tell her to come home after staying out past midnight celebrating homecoming?
The horror! The most bizarre complaint from the male plaintiff concerns 
an “inappropriate” birthday card he received from his horrible mother. 
It was inappropriate for two reasons. First, the card featured 
a grotesque picture of tomatoes with a special one that had been mutilated with craft-store googly eyes. The inside of the card ex-plained how the son was “different from all the rest.” 
How dare his mother call him special?Second, the card failed to have any money in it. Again, poor, 
poor children. 
The appeals court rightly found that ruling in favor of the 
children “could potentially open the floodgates to subject family child-rearing to … excessive judicial scrutiny and interference.” 
In other words, every little Billy and Sarah could potentially 
bring suit against one of their parents if they failed to buy them that candy bar for which they pined.
This could be made even worse for children of divorced par -
ents, especially if those parents hold a grudge against one an-other. The children could become tools of revenge. 
What this case really shows is a lack of respect by the chil-
dren, who are supposedly educated adults, and the father for the improper use of our judicial system. 
The courts should be reserved for people who have been seri-
ously harmed, whether it be by a criminal or civil act. These petty lawsuits are ruining the credibility of our judicial system while clogging up the courts for people who actually need them. 
A lawsuit like this is a costly endeavor, especially for the de-
fendant. Imagine if the plaintiffs who brought zany suits like these had to pay the defendants for all costs incurred if they lose the suit. 
These children are spoiled little brats who used their father’s 
counsel and ill-feelings toward their mother to make a mockery of our judicial system.Currently, our country is in the middle of an intense 
debate on the nature of entitlement programs for present and future generations.  This summer, I had 
the opportunity to travel to South Africa to see how their so-cial programs and regulations function.
It is no surprise that when Nelson Mandela came into 
power in 1994, throngs of people who had been cruelly sup-pressed for so long desired a more equitable distribution of the country’s wealth. A product of this feeling was the new South African constitution, which South Africans told me was the most progressive in the world. 
It includes the rights to free housing for the poor, health 
care for all, rights to employment and even the right of gay marriage. On the surface, it appears to be one of the noblest documents ever produced, that is, before you see what it has helped create.
In the slums of Alexandria, the clearest problem was un-
employment. The government promised everyone a job, and then instituted a minimum wage for various occupations. The wage is pitifully low by U.S. standards, but there is such an abundance of low-skilled labor from apartheid that any minimum wage seemed to create huge unemployment. 
In fact, the South African textile industry was suffering 
severely from Chinese competition. Without the power to lower wages, many companies were forced to close. In the absence of jobs, some young men inevitably join gangs like the Young Americans, JFKs and Ugly Americans, contribut-ing to one of the world’s highest violent-crime rates.
Black Economic Empowerment affirmative action in 
South Africa required certain jobs be filled with people of a certain racial categorization. Private companies in South Af-rica had to meet ownership requirements in which someone of nonwhite descent had to own a large percentage of the company . One man told me the government was obligated to only use nonwhite contractors. These firms were shell companies with no engineering knowledge and would re-quire millions of dollars more than the price offered by white-owned firms, receive the contract and then subcontract to the white firm at the 
price they originally bid.
All that the BEE affirmative action policies seem to have 
accomplished is a racial diversification of the rich. Many po-litically connected men are driving around in luxury vehicles and have become millionaires. In fact, there are now more black millionaires than white millionaires in South Africa. The intent of the policy was to create broad-based prosperity in the nonwhite community , but it seems that all it has left is an upper-class intent on retaining their wealth generated by a corrupt system.
Every indication is that these policies have caused masses 
of the affluent white community in South Africa to emigrate to opportunities elsewhere. They are now being limited in the  economy of South Africa just as they once limited black Africans.
Growth in South Africa is being severely restricted by 
these redistributive practices, and the tiny tax base is con-tinually diminishing.  
Now politicians are talking about nationalizing the min-
ing industry, further undermining investor and corporate confidence in the country , which would lead to further job losses and capital withdrawals. 
The policy actions taken by the government, given the 
painful legacy of apartheid, are emotionally understandable; however, they continue to keep South Africa’s most disad-vantaged groups mired in their condition. The mindset in-stilled in the poor is that the country will take care of them and that they should have low expectations for their own abilities to rise out of poverty. In South Africa, the govern-ment promised the moon and has been unable to even de-
liver a moon rock.

Speaking OutIllinois court closes due to emotional distress... MONDAY, AUGUST 29, 2011 § ALLIGATOR, 7
Currently , we are more than halfway through Ramadan. 
As a Muslim, I never want such a time to end, for there is no greater opportunity  when one can grow closer to 
Allah and gain good deeds.
This is done through more frequent praying, Quran recit-
ing, spending spiritual moments with loved ones, donating, especially by Muslims at the mosque, to the needy through zakah as a moral and spiritual investment (as well as a major pillar of Islam), and by, of course,  participating in the essence of Ramadan: fasting.
Noor Najjar, a student, blogger and a very dear friend of 
mine, posted on the first day of Ramadan a reminder about one of the core concepts of fasting: “The best way to understand a person is to step in their shoes. What better way to understand what the hungry or deprived endure except than to step in their shoes for 30 days?”
Noor’s post re-instilled this highly relevant and ever true 
notion. 
In turn, I would like to expand on it in light of recent global 
developments. While the importance of fasting is first and fore-most to exercise self-restraint and demonstrate discipline so that Muslims may become more righteous, there’s also a sec-ond benefit.
Ramadan provides an opportunity to sympathize with 
those struggling elsewhere in the world.
This could not be more appropriate to the current crises going on worldwide. For instance, East Africa is currently enduring a humanitarian crisis as a result of the worst drought in 60 years. Two failed rain seasons led to crop short-
ages on top of the Horn of Africa’s already vulnerable state. It is expected to affect more than 10 million people in countries including Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda and Djibouti.
According to reports by UNICEF, southern Somalia is suf-
fering from lack of proper health care and clean water, and insufficient food supply. In addition, Somalia’s political insta-bility is worsening to a critical condition, and hundreds of refu-gees flee to camps in Kenya, which struggles to accommodate. The images online and on television depicting the famine are beyond distressing.
Matters are expected to worsen with no rain forecast in sight. 
Spiking food prices are making it increasingly difficult for the main agencies to afford emergency aid, so your help is crucial. You can help UNICEF meet these needs by texting “FOOD” to 864233 to donate $10 or visit its website at www.unicefusa.org to donate online. You can also make a donation through nu-merous other agencies including Islamic Relief Worldwide by simply visiting their website at www.islamic-relief.com, which provides more information on their East Africa appeal.
Another life-threatening crisis overseas is Bashar al-Assad’s 
government crackdown on the Syrian people’s protests for re-form and civil rights. Al-Assad’s continued use of imprison-ment, torture and outright killing of any who oppose him in Syria has in turn made him one of the worst human rights of-fenders in the Middle East.
The tragic stories we hear from Syria hit home with many 
members of Syrian descent in Toledo who still have family there. This Ramadan, I am not alone in remembering other struggling populations of the world. Every night at my local mosque, I join the prayer of my fellow Muslims in the Toledo community to make a special call (du’aa) on behalf of people in Somalia, Syria and elsewhere.
Especially because we have basic necessities and securities 
we should never overlook, the tumult in Africa and in the Mid-dle East often frames our own concerns as quite trivial.
As a Muslim, I find acts through my faith as one of the most 
powerful reminders of such fundamental concepts. After such reflection, it is easy for me to discipline myself, to forget I have not had water since 5 o’clock in the morning. I can look forward to breaking my fast and sleeping comfortably at night once the sun sets, but I cannot speak on behalf of the millions of others globally who can not necessarily do so.
Living in a world that distracts and shuffles priorities, I find 
re-evaluating this world is most humanizing.
Ramadan Mubarak to all.Butheina Hamdah writes for The Independent Collegian at the 
University of Toledo.
Ramadan is time to pray, reflect on struggles abroadUWire
Who would persuade you better: a per -
son calmly explaining his evidence or someone calling you an idiot for 
disagreeing with him? Given how important persuasion is in democracies, you might think this would be well understood by now. Sadly , such common-sense rhetorical knowledge has been disregarded by liberals and Democrats in their approach toward tea party protesters.
Outreach and dialogue has taken a perma-
nent backseat to mockery and dismissal. Tea partiers are called gun nuts, lunatics, racists and even “terrorists.” A terrible myopia has led to a desperate, alienated audience being branded as irredeemably insane, stupid or evil. This strategy was tested in the 2010 mid-term elections and it resulted in huge Demo-cratic losses.
Media depictions create an image of a tea 
party that is palpably ignorant and clinging madly to its beliefs. The person holding the “Keep the government out of Medicare” sign is, of course, clearly out of step with reality . But does that make him evil? No. Perhaps if he were kindly presented with evidence that his Medicare coverage is being threatened by austerity hawks — that is, tea party Republi-cans — who are keen on slashing budgets, he would vote differently come election time. But why educate when we can point and laugh at how scared, misinformed people cannot spell “socialism” correctly on signs?
In fact, tea party protesters air some legiti-
mate grievances. Look at the economic situa-tion that has affected the nation’s poorest half for the last three decades. Noam Chomsky has observed that wages have stagnated and infla-tion has continued to rise, a doubly painful phenomenon summed up by the remarkably ugly word “stagflation.” Jobs that used to ex-ist in small towns are vanishing overseas. Cor -
porate profits continue to soar. Meanwhile, almost half of Americans are now “financially fragile” and thus unlikely or unable to come up with $2,000 in 30 days if it were needed.
There is good reason for these people to fear 
the future, but for the most part they have been distracted by right-wing propagandists who have them worrying about invisible monsters. Blame your problems on the lurking Mexican immigrants who will destroy our nation, just like the Chinese and the Irish did. Or perhaps all the problems are caused by that Marxist president who socializes ev-erything, creating 
unemployment. Wait a moment: In reality , corporate profits have grown massively dur -
ing President Obama’s term in office.
Would a Republican president want it any 
other way? Odd, but it seems conservative policies have a tendency to hinder just the sort of people who come out to tea party protests.
Some, like veteran journalist Christopher 
Hitchens, argue that one of the movement’s major motivations seems to be fear that demo-graphic shifts are a threat to a social order that grants whites great privilege. The manipula-tion of racial tensions by those who influence the tea partiers is unacceptable, but all signs indicate that racism does flourish among the poorer, less educated portion of the protest-ers.
Perhaps some tea party sympathizers will 
not change their beliefs about race even in the face of overwhelming evidence, but it is a di-verse group. Many tea party protesters would be glad to consider and confront the true ori-gins of their hardships — if they could only find out what they are.
Does any of this imply the tea party’s 
policy demands are the right ones? Of course not. So many of their recommendations and demands are founded on huge political and macroeconomic misunderstandings that it makes one wonder if they are talking about the real world. This does not nullify the fact that they also are voters with a right to partici-pate in the electoral process and the ability to cancel out well-reasoned votes if they buy into fabrications.
Liberals must make a choice. They can do 
the easy thing and laugh about the way tea party protesters continue accepting right-wing distortions, or they can roll up their sleeves and take on the civic challenge of speaking candidly to their fellow citizens. If they do the latter, they might see that tea partiers, armed with real facts about the political landscape, do not seem so crazy after all.

at the University of Virginia.

Florida outside hitter Stephanie Ferrell was named the Active Ankle SEC/ACC Challenge’s Most 
Valuable Player after recording 20 kills and hitting .382 in two games during the weekend.  
UF VOLLEYBALL

Sophomore outside hitter Stepha-
nie Ferrell and the Gators know how to start out on the right foot — or ankle.
No. 9 Florida dominated the Ac-
tive Ankle SEC/ACC Challenge during the weekend, sweeping Bos-ton College (25-11, 25-15, 25-16) and North Carolina (25-17, 25-20, 25-14) in straight sets.
In perhaps the most telling statis-
tic of the two-day tournament, the Gators recorded a hitting percent-age of .327 while their Atlantic Coast Conference opponents managed a meager .092.
The only time the Gators broke a 
sweat during the weekend came in a back-and-forth second set with the Tar Heels.
“(UNC) did a much better job hit-
ting around the block and forcing our defense (in the second set),” UF coach Mary Wise said. 
“They’re a very well-coached team 
and you can see why they won a lot of matches last year.”
Leading the way for the Gators 
was Ferrell, who was named the Ac-tive Ankle SEC/ACC Challenge’s Most Valuable Player.
Ferrell recorded 20 kills during the 
weekend and had a .382 hitting per -centage, a marked improvement over her career clip of .232.
“She’s going to be a streaky play-
er and when she’s hot as she was in back-to-back matches, then our team will really benefit from that,” Wise said. 
“It’s not been an easy transition for 
her — I think for any transfer, there’s so many adjustments to be made and there were times when she and I both wondered if we were going to get to this point – but no player has worked harder to get to this.”
Ferrell beat out 
senior outside hitter Kristy Jaeckel, who 
had a solid case of her own for tourna-ment MVP .
Jaeckel recorded 
19 kills and 14 digs in UF’s two games, including a double-
double (12 kills, 10 digs) in the win against the Tar Heels.
“When the match started, Kristy 
left some digs out there, but as the match went on, she did a much better job,” Wise said. 
“For her to finish with a double-
double, that’s the type of perfor -
mance that we need out of our out-side hitters.”Florida starts season 
with sweep of UNC, BC

For much of last year, there were 
questions about whether then-
freshman defensive tackle Domin-ique Easley would make it to a sec-ond season in a Florida uniform. 
Rumors that he was considering 
transferring were rampant, and Ea-sley’s four tackles in just six game appearances didn’t match the hype that followed Rivals.com rank-ing him the No. 2 defensive tackle recruit in the country out of high school. 
But Easley stuck it out, and now 
he’s taking advantage of a fresh start under coach Will Muschamp. 
“He’s definitely more mature,” 
junior defensive tackle Omar Hunt-er said. “He has the right mind go-ing into the season. He knows we’re counting on him to play a lot. He definitely stepped it up.” 
Easley said 
he felt home-sick during his freshman cam-
paign as he struggled to adjust to a lifestyle that was much slower than what he became accustomed to growing up in Staten Island, N.Y. 
There were also reports that No longer homesick, DT 
Easley ready to step uptELLing YOU w Atts Up
Forget waiting until Sept. 3. Those eager 
to see Coach Boom in action need only look to Wednesday night’s press con-
ference.
Will Muschamp ended a team scrimmage 
early because, he said, his team was lethar -
gic in situational drills, leading to an impas-sioned display in front of reporters and TV cameras. 
But practice is closed. It has been since 
spring. The only people who know what’s going on aren’t talking about it, or aren’t al-lowed to. 
How do we know if practice was really 
that bad?
Here’s what Muschamp had to say:“We did not execute very well. Mental 
toughness was not there. Very immature football team at this point. Not consistently performing at the level we need to perform at.
“Overall, pretty displeased. Not what we 
were looking for tonight, that’s for sure.”He went on to add:“It’s just a lack of 
focus on what you’re supposed to do and how you’re supposed to do it. We’re in (a two-minute drill); we have guys walking around. We have no 
sense of urgency about what we do and how we do it and how we approach it. Very frus-trating.”
When asked, Muschamp wouldn’t call 
the scrimmage — the same one he said would cost potential starters their jobs — a step backward, but he did say, “It dang sure wasn’t a step forward.”
Sure, coach. Whatever you say. “One Voice,” right? In reality, Muschamp and his staff must 
have realized that the spewing overload of positive spin coming from the program Coach’s tirade not what it seems

Midfielder McKenzie Barney scored the game-winning goal in Friday’s game against 
Texas A&M, but UF couldn’t duplicate that success in Sunday’s 2-0 loss to UCLA.JOSH JURNOVOY
Alligator Writer
 
The Gators found themselves trailing in 
the first half Sunday afternoon for the sec-ond time in as many games.
But unlike Friday night, when the Gators 
got a game-winning goal from midfielder McKenzie Barney, No. 8 Florida (3-1-0, 0-0 Southeastern Conference) was unable to conjure up any late-game heroics as it fell 2-0 to No. 15 UCLA (3-0, 0-0-0 Pac-12) to end the First Tennessee Lady Vols Classic in Knoxville, Tenn.
In handing UF its first loss of the sea-
son, the Bruins were able to penetrate the Gators’ defense early, sending two shots off the crossbar in the second minute of action.
UCLA took the lead in the 35th minute 
on a goal from freshman defender Ally Courtnall. 
The Bruins then added an insurance goal 
in the 72nd minute when freshman Sarah Killon intercepted a UF clearance attempt and played it to All-American forward Syd-ney Leroux, who put it past Gators keeper Brooke Chancey.
“We trust our players to take care of the 
ball in front of the goal,” said coach Becky Burleigh. “Unfortunately, sometimes mis-takes like those happen and we have to limit them.”
Missed opportunities were a common 
occurrence throughout the game for the Gators. In the 22nd minute, Florida nearly took the lead when freshman forward Tessa Andujar played a through ball to Barney, but her shot was saved by UCLA keeper Katelyn Rowland.
The Gators came out aggressively in the 
second half, doubling their shot total from four to eight in the first seven minutes of the half. But Florida could not convert.
In the 51st minute, freshman midfielder 
Havana Solaun received the ball in the box off a corner kick and passed it to fellow midfielder Sarah Chapman, but she was un-able to put the ball in the near corner of the goal. 
Senior Lindsay Thompson’s shot also 
went just wide of the post in the 64th min-ute.
Burleigh said she was encouraged by her 
team’s play and the opportunities created against a team she considers to be one of the best in the country.
“Did we give ourselves enough scoring 
chances to win the game? Yes,” she said. “Did we convert on enough of those oppor-tunities? No.”
However, Florida did convert on Friday, 
when it defeated No. 18 Texas A&M, 3-2, after a game-winning goal from Barney, her first of the season. She put a cross from defender Jazmyne Avant in the back of the net with just 15 seconds remaining in regu-lation.
The Gators got on the board first as Erika 
Tymrak scored her first goal of the season from nine yards out on a through ball from Solaun. After two straight Aggies goals, sophomore Taylor Travis tied it up for the Gators in the 39th minute off a cross from Thompson.
This season is the first in the 17-year his-
tory of the Gators soccer program that the team played its first four games on the road. The Gators’ road trip comes to an end Fri-day as they return to Pressley Stadium to host the Texas Tech.
“We are absolutely looking forward to 
being back in front of the home crowd,” Burleigh said.
Missed opportunities haunt Gators in first loss of season
“Unfortunately, sometimes mis-
takes like those happen and we 
have to limit them.”
Becky Burleigh 
UF soccer coachthroughout the entirety of 
fall camp was just too much.
Who’s starting? “Nobody, we’re all start-
ers.” “It’s a rotation, every-one is good.” 
How’s Johnny look? “Great.” “Amazing.” 
“Heisman candidate.”
The program had to real-
ize that people were starting to expect, at the least, a very competitive football team this fall. Muschamp’s verbal beatdown was merely a tem-pering of expectations and a motivational ploy.
Defensive tackle Domi-
nique Easley confirmed the latter Thursday.
“He just wants us to know 
that we’re not who we’re supposed to be yet,” he said. 
Easley said Wednesday’s 
scrimmage wasn’t actually that bad. In fact, it was an improvement over the previ-ous two. 
“From my perspective, 
everything went good,” Ea-sley said. 
“Obviously some things 
went bad. Every team, certain things go bad. But the way I look at it everything went good. He seemed a little up-set because some plays went wrong, some people didn’t do what they were supposed to be doing, but that happens everywhere.”
The fact is this team isn’t 
where Muschamp, or the ra-bid fans of the Gator Nation, expect it to be. 
There is minimal senior 
presence, and most of the more-talented players on the roster are underclassmen. 
Add to the mix a brand 
new coaching staff and a complicated pro-style scheme on both sides of the ball, and what you get is a mentally confused, young football team. 
There will be growing 
pains this fall. 
There aren’t many guar -
antees around this team, but that much you can count on. Just ask Jeff Demps.
“If we played tonight, I 
couldn’t even tell you [what would happen],” Demps said Thursday. 
“I’m pretty sure guys 
would go out and compete and play as hard as they can, but as far as just mentally be-ing there, I’m not sure.”
Contact Matt Watts at 
mwatts@alligator.org.internal conflicts with teammates 
were part of the reason he consid-ered a switch. Easley was a member of the freshman class former center Mike Pouncey said needed to “just shut their mouth and come play,” and many felt that Easley and team-mates Sharrif Floyd and Ronald Powell entered UF with a sense of entitlement. 
Easley even compared the trio to 
the Miami Heat’s Big 3.
Hunter admitted these conflicts 
might have played a role in Easley’s discontent, but Hunter spoke highly of his character overall. 
“[Easley is] a good guy you can 
get along with easy,” Hunter said. “He comes out and he talks to ev-eryone. He’s a good teammate.”
After originally denying transfer 
rumors in the spring, Easley con-fessed he considered a change of scenery, but said he decided to per -
severe through his troubles.
“I just wouldn’t let myself give 
up,” Easley said. “That’s a personal pride thing that I took upon my-self.”
Hunter also credited himself and 
strength and conditioning coach Mark Campbell for Easley’s return. Both spoke to him often, with Camp-bell playing the role of a mentor. 
Like Easley, Hunter came to UF 
with extreme pressure and high ex-pectations, equipping him with the perspective necessary to talk Easley through his issues. 
Now, Easley says he’s become 
wiser and has started making bet-ter decisions. On the field, he said he has improved his technique and has learned to read offensive line-men, while off the field he spends more time thinking about football and less time going out. 
Hunter said Easley has taken ten 
big steps forward in terms of his maturity, and that the sophomore is working harder while talking less. 
When Easley does open his 
mouth, it’s usually in a fun-loving manner or as an accompaniment to his much-maligned dancing. 
“He has some weird dance 
moves, I don’t know where he gets those from,” sophomore guard Jon Halapio said. 
“Those dance moves bring a little 
energy to the locker room if we’re having a dull day. If we’re not feel-ing practice, he’ll just come in there and start dancing.”
Said Easley: “I just have fun. … I 
just try to keep dancing.”

However, Jaeckel’s biggest contribution of 
the weekend came late in the second set against 
North Carolina.
The Gators and Tar Heels went back and 
forth until two late digs by Jaeckel helped seal a 25-20 win.
“As a team, we kind of lost focus a little bit, 
but with those two digs, we regrouped and bounced back,” Ferrell said. “Kristy motivated the whole team and created momentum and we just rode the wave.”
Ferrell and Jaeckel were two of the four Gators 
named to the Active An-kle SEC/ACC Challenge All-Tournament team, joining senior setter Kel-ly Murphy and redshirt 
freshman libero Taylor Unroe.
After redshirting the 2010 season because of 
a broken bone in her ankle, Unroe finally made her collegiate debut.
“Last year was pretty much terrible sitting on 
the bench,” Unroe said. “Now I get to go out there and do what I’ve been doing my whole life, so it feels great.”
The redshirt freshman defensive specialist 
adjusted well, recording a team-high 19 digs in two games.
“I’m sure she shocked everyone, but it’s no 
surprise to us how great she is and how hard she works,” Jaeckel said. 
“We’ve been lucky to have her since last 
year.”VOLLeyBALL , from page 13“[Easley] has some weird
