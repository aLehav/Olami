At around 8 p.m. on Tuesday a female 
UF student was mugged on the 800 block of 
SW 9th.
The 20-year-old was walking alone, 
when an unarmed mugger demanded she hand over her laptop and iPhone, according to Sgt. Michael Douglas of the Gainesville Police Department.
After stealing the items, the mugger ran 
from the victim. The victim went back to her house before calling police, leading to a 15-minute lag time before they were able to respond to the incident. The police are work-ing leads, but as of Tuesday night no arrest had been made.
Douglas said the GPD emphasizes that 
lone females need to pay careful attention to their surroundings at night. He also said any victim of a crime should go to the clos-est telephone possible to contact police im-mediately.

On a shady street in east Gainesville, a 
teal house stands between tall trees. Paul 
Anthony Sr. planted those trees himself.
It’s an unremarkable house on an unre-
markable block. Anthony’s second cousin 
lives across the street. Brittish Walker is 20, 
and she likes to sit on the porch and play dominoes. From her porch, she can see the teal house, the trees, the driveway. She was watching from her porch Monday, a cool, crisp, so-far unremarkable day. Her dogs, usually frantic and jumpy, were quiet. 
She watched Anthony pull his car into 
a spot next to his house. He began to rinse 
off his car, a black Chevy Impala with 
tinted windows. He was proud of that car. Walker wanted to catch up, and crossed the street to greet him. They talked about the Gators loss to Alabama. He told her what he thought the team should have done. She walked back to her house and noticed a red truck coming down the street. 
“I didn’t think nothing of it,” she said.Anthony, who became one of six victims 
in the shooting spree Monday, is not the type to get into arguments. Family mem-bers describe him as a kind, quiet man who keeps to himself and his family. He attends the Church of the Kingdom of God every Sunday unless he has to work. He’s 43 and 
a manager at Captain D’s sea-
food restaurant. He has five 
kids. According to Walker, he knew Clifford L. Miller Jr. 
“He was just like somebody from the 
neighborhood,” she said. “He knew us very well.”
Miller grew up in the neighborhood. He 
would get into arguments with his mother, Walker said. Loud, heated arguments. He 
would storm out of the house and walk Witness recounts her cousin’s shooting

ORLANDO — David Bean used to 
get away with staying up late to study 
by stuffing towels underneath his door.
It was the late 1940s. Life in the Navy 
meant strict rules, but Bean had goals. 
He wanted to be a pharmacist. Lights 
out didn’t matter.
He spent all the money he had to 
buy his first pharmacy in Orlando in 1966, after spending 14 years working 
in local pharmacies. He had gotten his 
pharmacy degree from UF in 1952, and he had support from friends, associates and, eventually, his customers.
“I had the best customers in the 
world,” he said.
More than 40 years later, the 83-year-
old Sarasota native stood near a 100,000-square-foot plot of land Tues-
day -- a plot he helped purchase -- sur -
veying it with wide eyes.
This is the site of the UF Research 
and Academic Center at Lake Nona, a 
$44 million facility that will soon house 
the Orlando campus of the College of 
Pharmacy’s entry-level professional degree program, along with other bio-medical research projects.
“It’s just fantastic,” he said, smiling widely.
About 200 university, state and lo-
cal officials gathered Tuesday for the 
groundbreaking of the site, located less 
than five miles south of Orlando Inter -
national Airport.
Bean donated five acres of land to UF 
in 2000, shortly after his wife died. He received the land from a customer who gave it to him to pay off prescription bills.
The university sold the land for $1.2 
million — money Bean said should be 
used toward establishing an Orlando 
campus for UF pharmacy students.
The campus will bear the name of 
Bean and his late wife, Helen.
UF President Bernie Machen said 
the groundbreaking facility marks the beginning of UF’s first major research initiative away from Gainesville.“It is part of our vision of the Univer -
sity of Florida as a global beacon, one that is available statewide, nationally 
and globally,” he said.
Karl Healy, a pharmacy doctoral stu-
dent, said he’s looking forward to hav-
ing educational and research activities 
housed in one building.
“It presents the unique opportunity 
for students to play an active role in re-
search,” he said.
Among the attendees were Florida 
Chief Financial Officer and gubernato -
rial hopeful Alex Sink, Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer, Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum and Rep. Dean Cannon.
Cannon, a UF alumnus, said the cam-
pus will add to the clout the university’s name carries.
“That’s great for anyone with a UF 
degree,” he said.
As the crowd began to thin, Bean 
beamed as he looked out again at the land that will host the new facility. He recalled his years as a pharmacist, and 
he spoke of how students should know 
they are being trained for success— just like he was.
“The students don’t realize how well 
they’re getting prepared,” he said.
“Words can’t express it.”Officials break ground on facility

With Election Day less than a month away, 
Florida is once again in the national spotlight, 
according to a distinguished professor of polit-ical science at the University of South Florida. 
Susan MacManus is also the most-quoted 
political commentator in the state of Florida, and among the top five most widely quoted in the nation. 
MacManus spoke to a crowd of about 60 
people in Pugh Hall Tuesday night about the Florida gubernatorial and senate races and the anger of voters. 
The economy and a lack of jobs are causing  
frustration and therefore an interesting race in Florida politics, she said. 
“Florida is the fourth largest state and if 
Charlie Crist wins as an Independent, it will set a new model for Independent candidates to run and win in other states,” MacManus said
She also talked about national politics and 
how Americans have little confidence in Con-gress. 
During her PowerPoint presentation, she 
highlighted several Rasmussen reports about American’s attitudes on pressing issues such as the federal deficit, immigration, federal stimulus and confidence in Congress. 
In the May 2010 Rasmussen report, 41 per -
cent of Americans reportedly said a group of people selected at random from the phone book would do a better job than the current Congress. 
The September 2010 Rasmussen report 
states that 79 percent of people believe that members of Congress are more interested in advancing their own careers than helping their constituents.
“People believe that big is not good and nei-
ther is longevity for members in Congress,” MacManus said.
Americans are frustrated and 
they want someone different rep-
resenting them, she said. 
With voters angry about the economy and 
little confidence in law makers, it will be a wild race the next couple of weeks, she said.  
Ann Henderson, director of the Bob Graham 
Center, said she hopes that voters will be bet-ter informed to cast their ballots in four weeks. “You couldn’t do better listening to Susan Mac-Manus and to her analysis of Florida politics,” Henderson said.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2010

A bicyclist hit a woman on cam-
pus Tuesday morning, sending her 
to the infirmary . 
At about 11:30 a.m., Alfredo Kier -
nan crashed into the woman while she was crossing the crosswalk be-
tween Weimer Hall and the Florida Gymnasium. 
“I thought she’d keep walking, 
but I didn’t stop at the crosswalk,” Kiernan said. “I accidentally hit her.” 
Candace Tossas, a telecommu-nications major who was shooting a video for class, called University Police.
“I looked after this loud smash 
and saw this girl with blood drip-ping from her mouth and screaming, so I called police right away ,” Tossas 
said. “I wasn’t 100 percent sure what happened, it was such a shock.”
The woman was face down in the 
road and screaming while the cyclist tried to help her up.
UPD Capt. Jeff Holcomb said a 
police report was not filed, and the 
woman did not press charges. 
“I hate to say it, but these things are considered minor incidents,” Holcomb said.  “Although, if I was hit by a bike, it definitely wouldn’t 
be a minor incident.”
The young woman requested to 
be taken to the infirmary in a police 
car to avoid paying for an ambu-
lance ride, Holcomb said.  Cyclist hits UF student crossing street near Fla. gymWEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2010 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Santa Fe College participated in 
a White House summit on commu-
nity colleges Tuesday by submitting a video-recorded discussion.
The summit was held to empha-
size the role community colleges play in developing the country’s workforce and reaching America’s educational goals.
Community colleges are Amer -
ica’s “best-kept secret,” said Jill Biden, the vice president’s wife, who chaired the summit.
The full-day event brought to-
gether representatives of the 1,200 community colleges in the U.S., businesses, philanthropies, political leaders and students. 
The White House set up various 
ways for community colleges and their students to participate in the discussion of ways to improve com-munity colleges in the future. They 
could submit a video, participate in 
the online dialogue or plan an event. Santa Fe College submitted a video that showed former and current stu-dents discussing how SFC has fur -
thered their knowledge and training for their desired fields.
The video describes how com-
munity colleges are an alternative 
path for non-traditional students to 
achieve their goals in a way that is more comfortable for them.
They discussed how smaller 
classes provided more one-on-one time, how the atmo-sphere is similar to a family-like relation-
ship between students and teachers and proposed changes that would better their learning institution.
Marilyn Tubb, associate vice 
president of college relations for SFC, said it was very interesting to see what the White House had to say about the roles of community colleges in today’s economy and the 
role they will play in the future. 
SFC offers bachelor degrees in 
early childhood education, clinical 
lab management and health science administration. 
“Our goal is not to become a uni-
versity, but to be a very good com-munity college,” Tubb said.
SFC proposed ideas that included 
providing federal funding to install high-speed wireless to all commu-nity colleges; granting forgiveness for students with financial aid debt who agree to teach at a community college for three years and increas-ing Perkins grants, which promote the careers and technical training of students who elect to enroll in voca-
tional technical programs. 
Melinda Gates and the Bill & Me-
linda Gates Foundation announced 
that they will be putting $35 million into new grants, according to Tubb.
This summit was to ensure the 
American people that the United States will have the most educated and well-trained workforce in the 
world, and this will start with com-
munity colleges.Santa Fe

Time Square bomber 
sentenced
Justice was swift, but Allah is still great.
After being sentenced to life in prison Tuesday, Fais-
al Shahzad, the Pakistani-born attempted Times Square 
bomber, said he was pleased with his sentence and believes 
that “God is [still] great.”
Handing down the toughest sentence allowed by law, 
Judge Miriam Cedarbaum threw the book at a terrorist who 
could have, if successful, thrown the United States back into a 
tizzy fit of terror and fear not seen in nine years since the twin 
towers toppled before our eyes. 
And luckily for Americans and the world, the Nissan Path-
finder Shahzad used as a car bomb turned out to be an epic fail 
and never blew.
Shahzad’s lack of remorse and desire to actions show just 
how little the success or ultimate failure of his actions mean to the outcome.
His desire, ultimately, was to show Americans the worst 
side of a religion marred by the few radicals who choose to speak for the billion other peaceful members across the globe. 
And his lack of remorse was no less notable when he en-
tered the courtroom Tuesday and warned Americans more at-tacks were imminent and unavoidable. 
“This is the first droplet of the flood that will follow,” 
Shahzad warned. 
With the ambiguous, kind-of-sort-of-stay-away-from-
Europe travel advisory the U.S. Department of State recently issued, Americans and the rest of the world should realize, un-
fortunately, we live in a world where we’re told to be perpetu-
ally fearful of everyone around us to ultimately better protect ourselves.
Frito-Loud
The noise is quietly be-
ing dumped.
Just about a year 
and a half after Frito-Lay in-
troduced its earmuff-almost-necessary-to-open-it biode-
gradable SunChips bag, the 
junk food giant is sending the 
bags to the dump and rein-
troducing the totally-not-sus-tainable old version while the 
company tries to find a bag 
that’s quietly biodegradable. 
The bags have made such 
a joke in between chip chow 
down sessions that more than 44,000 people have joined 
the Facebook group “Sorry, but I can’t hear you over this 
SunChips bag.” 
Seriously, if you haven’t 
crumpled one of these bags, 
do it before they’re gone. It’s 
like a rite of passage compa-
rable to learning to play “Hot 
Cross Buns” on the recorder 
in elementary school. 
While we don’t want to say the bags, which some say 
are louder than a garbage dis-
posal with a fork caught in it, 
are responsible for SunChips 
profits declining more than 11 percent during the past year, 
we think those 44,000 Face-
book fans might disagree.
But more importantly, we 
realize Frito-Lay, after all the fattening up its done to our 
kids worse than the old lady 
who lived in a house made 
of candy in “Hansel and 
Gretel,” was trying to do the 
right thing by reducing the waste the company processes 
every day. 
And we realize regardless 
of the fate of its noisy bags, more companies will inevita-
bly learn from Frito-Lay and 
adopt quieter versions of the 
soon-to-be-obsolete bags that 
decompose naturally.
And that’s the kind of 
noise we like to hear. Florida should decriminalize marijuana
Katy Perry was right. In California, the grass is al-
ways greener. And as of last week, getting caught with an ounce or less of grass won’t get you jail 
time, it will only get you a $100 fine and a citation. For those playing at home, that’s about three days of parking 
citations from UF and less than one citation for using a 
duplicate decal.
Non-medical marijuana has officially been decriminal-
ized in the state of California, making it the 12th state in the union to do so. It also puts California on a path to be-ing on the right side of history.
Say what you want about marijuana as a whole, but 
decriminalization for small possession is a logical move. 
Prison overcrowding is a legitimate issue in the United 
States, and as it currently stands I’d much rather let small-time users free than convicted sex offenders and murder -
ers. I feel much more safe around those who are growing dazed and confused than those who have a history of vio-lent crime. It’s just common sense.
Now, here’s where it gets tricky. California, as of now, 
legally allows medical marijuana (like 15 other states), and there’s no restriction on the amount as long as the user is registered through his or her county. It now also 
allows non-medical marijuana to be used, but only up to 
an ounce. 
The federal government? Not so much. In Gonzales v. Raich, the Supreme Court ruled  that the 
federal government under the commerce clause still had the right to arrest and penalize marijuana users who were using the drug legally under their respective state laws but were still violating federal law by possessing it, regardless of whether or not it was an ounce or a pound.
Thankfully, a few months after Obama’s inauguration, 
Attorney General Eric Holder announced he’d be ordering the Drug Enforcement Agency to stop seizures in states where marijuana was legal. That’s a good move. It saves time, resources and, frankly, who cares if a nonviolent citi-zen took a few hits from his pipe? Smuggling cocaine from Colombia? Bigger deal. 
Taking a few hits of a non-addic-
tive substance that has caused zero 
reported deaths in comparison to 
tobacco or alcohol should not be the focus of the Department of Justice.
It’s time for a common-sense 
conversation about marijuana in the 
state of Florida. California’s Proposition 19 will be up for a vote in less than a month. This bill would legalize and tax cannabis in the state, which is further than any other state in the union has gone to legalize marijuana. 
Florida on the other hand? No legal medical marijuana, 
no decriminalized possession of marijuana. Behind the times? Understatement.
Unfortunately for everyday voters, there is one issue 
that goes unnoticed: the people who profit the most from marijuana being illegal. It’s the drug dealers themselves. 
As there is no set open-market value, dealers and grow-
ers can capitalize and make huge profits. Legalizing and taxing marijuana would provide the government tax rev-
enue, eliminate the true black market and implement safe-
guards like those used in helping to prevent the sale of tobacco or alcohol to minors. 
Just the other day at a Gainesville head shop, I saw a 
responsible shop owner ask younger patrons their age and force a 16-year-old to leave. Right now, middle schoolers are smoking marijuana because no such safeguards exist. Obviously, the safeguards aren’t universal, but they do help more than they hurt.
Hopefully, Florida will one day be on the right side of 
history when it comes to ending prohibition of marijuana.

Letters to the Editor
Fox News is the Republican Party
I am writing in response to Chris Dodson’s 
Monday column, which condemned President 
Obama’s negative view of Fox News.
Dodson implies the president is somehow 
impeding on Fox’s freedom of speech by call-
ing it out on its war against his administra-
tion.  
However, Dodson doesn’t understand 
Obama is also entitled to the same freedom of 
speech that gives Fox the right to attack him 24/7.  
Dodson misinterpreted the president’s ob-
jective and takes his “Rolling Stone” quotation slightly out of context. 
In the magazine article, Obama clearly 
states that although he believes the ideology 
Fox News sells is bad for the country, he com-
pletely respects its right to voice these opin-
ions.  
MSNBC and other mainstream media out-
lets are not without their occasional flukes and 
biases.  
However, I believe Fox has gotten out of control to the point where there is little distinc-tion between it and the party it promotes. 
Is anyone else disturbed by the fact that 
head Republican presidential candidates actu-
ally work for Fox (Sarah Palin, Newt Gingrich, 
Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum)?  
The corporation that owns Fox News re-
cently donated $1 million to the Republican 
Governors Association and $1 million to the US Chamber of Commerce (a conservative 
business lobby). 
Fox is the mouth, the wallet and the boss 
of the GOP . The president’s objections don’t 
make him a villain; they prove his sanity .

Capitalism not to blame for negative foreign affairs
Idan Solon’s Tuesday letter to the editor in 
which he attempts to chastise a capitalist sys-tem through actions by the U.S. government misses the mark. 
In fact, it only further proves the point Wil-
liam Tew was trying to make in his Monday 
letter about the benefits of capitalism. 
While Solon goes on to list many foreign in-
terventions of our government, he then wraps 
those actions up as a by-product of our “capi-
talist-spawned U.S. corporations.”
Instead, one might view these actions as 
the by-product of an increasingly out of con-trol federal government that only hampers the 
free market system.
The actions of the U.S. government in for -
eign nations have been embarrassing at best 
— however, that’s not a fault of a capitalist society . 
Solon is right when he says a free market 
provides fruitful results, but it is unfortunate 
that those are continually hampered by an 
inefficient and largely corrupt federal bureau-cracy .

� � �Money not source of all evil
Mr. Solon is right to condemn our gov-
ernment’s clandestine escapades. They are 
inexcusable stains on this country, but they 
are not products of capitalism.
  Leftist states have been just as quick 
to perpetrate the horrors he ascribes to the 
CIA and often on scales not seen in this 
country. In fact, many of the most heinous 
crimes of the past half century were com-mitted by communist states.  And when it comes to sabotaging economies, leftist governments don’t need CIA help.  The 
allegation that corporations control U.S. 
policy smacks of conspiracy theory.  
I’m not so naive as to think corporate 
lobbies have no effect, but too many peo-
ple attribute too much of the evil in this 
world to money.  Maybe, just maybe, the crimes governments commit come from government, not from free trade.

Gainesville police stand outside the home of victim Cliffard Miller Sr. 
after a shooting spree that left five wounded and one dead. The gunman, Cliffard Miller Jr., was found at about 6 
Victim’s cousin: Shooter was unstable, picked fights in neighborhood
around mumbling to himself and starting fights. He got into it 
once with Anthony’s son, Paul Jr.  Walker thinks this is one of the reasons Miller came by Anthony’s house.
Miller, 24, was a drug user with a cocaine conviction. “He was kinda like, on the insane side,” she said. 
It was about 3:45 in the afternoon. Anthony was rinsing 
off his Impala ten steps from the street. The red truck pulled 
up. Walker heard three shots. She made it five steps into the house.
She panicked. She heard the tires squeal, and when she ran 
outside she saw Anthony limping in the street, on the phone with 911. He tried to get a tag number, but the red truck didn’t have one. She ran to help him. He couldn’t walk. He stum-bled. She grabbed him.  He was shot through the left torso and 
left buttocks.  He started muttering, repeating: “It was a red 
truck.”
She dragged him the three steps onto the wide porch in 
front of his house. The amount of blood surprised her. 
She ran across the street to her house to get some towels. 
When she got back he was moaning, fading. She put pressure on the wounds, and the towels grew heavy and wet.
“What’s your name?”He struggled to answer: “Stay with me.”
She told him he was going to be all right. She was scared. It 
could have been her. She could be the one bleeding.
“Stay with me,” she told him. 
The police came, and she helped remove his clothes. He was 
breathing heavy and slow. They took him away. She couldn’t go. The ambulance drove off and left her there, shaken and sticky with his blood.
A couple of hours later, before she’d learned that her cousin 
would survive the night, detectives returned to the house with 
the name of the shooter: Clifford Miller Jr., the young man from 
the neighborhood. The one she always suspected was a little unstable. He had driven away and shot himself in the head. 
Walker went back inside, changed her clothes and tried to 
scrub away the blood, but it wouldn’t come off. She’d waited too long.
She gave up. She threw her clothes away.SHOOTING , from page 1� THE MAN REFUSED TO BE

An Alachua County Sheriff’s 
Office employee was arrested 
Monday and charged with steal-ing money from the sheriff’s of-
fice. 
Charles Allen Smith, 26, of 
2701 SW 13th St., is accused of stealing more than $16,000 from 
the ASO evidence room. 
Smith was employed as an ev-
idence custodian at ASO and was 
one of three employees with ac-cess to the missing evidence. 
The cash was deposited by the Waldo Police Department, and 
discovered to be 
missing in Au-gust. 
While the 
other two evi-dence custodi-ans cooperated with police and passed a poly-
graph test, the suspect refused to be interviewed during the in-vestigation, according to a police report. 
After subpoenaing his finan-
cial records, police found that the 
suspect and his roommate, Rob-
ert Sundin, purchased a 2008 Jeep Liberty and a 2009 Travel Trailer in May with $6,000 in cash down payments.
 Sundin told police that Smith had said the money came from a worker’s compensation settle-ment, according to the report. 
Smith had been receiving bi-
weekly workers compensation 
benefits for an injury he sustained 
in September of 2007.
Smith was charged with a 
third-degree grand-theft felony and a third-degree money laun-
dering felony. Sheriff’s office employee charged with stealing

New information was released 
Tuesday in the shootings that left 
two dead and five injured in east Gainesville on Monday afternoon.
In a press conference this morn-
ing, police released the victims names and health conditions. The suspect’s father, Clifford Lewis Mill-er Sr., 52, died; Anthony Mitchell, 44, and Lloyd Dunn, 67, were in fair con-dition as of Tuesday morning. The other three victims, Vincent Sallet, 43; Paul Anthony Sr., 43; and Cedric Joiner, 36, are in critical condition as 
of Tuesday morning.
The shooter, Clifford Miller Jr., 
24, drove around in a red Chevrolet 
truck and fired on the victims with a .38 caliber revolver. He then died af-ter shooting himself in the head at a residence on SE 46th Terrace.
Cpl. Tscharna Senn, Gainesville 
Police spokeswoman, said he had to 
stop and reload at some point but 
would not speculate on whether the crimes were pre-meditated. She said that the relationship between the sus-
pect and the victims is not yet clear.
In 2005, Miller was 
arrested for cocaine pos-
session. In August 2006 and again in 
April 2008 he was arrested for violat-
ing probation.
In April 2009, he was arrested for 
a DUI when he refused to sign the ci-tation. He was arrested twice in No-vember for failing to appear in court. In March he was found mentally un-able to stand trial.Shooting update given

Jesse Schmitt sees more to Humans vs. 
Zombies than just a bunch of people play-
ing tag with NERF guns and socks. 
Schmitt and his group of players teamed 
up with Stephanie Covey and her Backpack 
Club to collect cans to feed hungry children in Alachua County. 
The drive began Sept. 20 and will contin-
ue until Nov. 3., and more than 20 bags of cans were collected during the first week.
Gators Humans vs. Zombies had 900 ac-
tive players at the last game and has more than 1,700 fans on its Facebook page. 
“Once I saw that the group was going 
to be as big as it was, I realized we could really make a difference,” said Schmitt, 
who is the president of Gators Humans vs. 
Zombies.  
Schmitt told his members that he would 
give the person who collected the most 
cans a “bonus” on the first day of the next game: the ability for humans to be allowed 
to carry NERF guns, which they currently cannot do.   
The Backpack Club currently feeds 60 
children: 40 at the A. Quinn Jones Center 
and 20 at Littlewood Elementary. With 
Schmitt and his Humans vs. Zombies group helping out, that number could easily reach 100, Covey said. 
Covey, who created Backpack Club Inc., 
wants to see her club grow larger and reach a national audience one day. 
Her goal is to end hunger altogether for 
children. 
“I want it to no longer be a need,” she 
said.Zombie game feeds children

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
WASHINGTON — A daylong, 
nationwide effort to get people to 
turn in old or unwanted prescrip-
tion drugs collected more than 121 tons of unused medicine.
With prescription drug abuse 
on the rise, the goal was to keep the drugs from falling into the hands of abusers and criminals.
The Drug Enforcement Admin-
istration organized the national prescription drug “Take-Back” day 
for Sept. 25. Officials offered people 
across the country a free, anony-
mous and legal way to get rid of 
potentially dangerous prescription drugs that have been cluttering 
medicine cabinets.
“The Take-Back Campaign was 
a stunning nationwide success that 
cleaned out more than 121 tons of 
pills from America’s medicine cabi-
nets, a crucial step toward reducing 
the epidemic of prescription drug 
abuse that is plaguing this nation,” DEA Acting Administrator Michele M. Leonhart said in a statement 
Tuesday.
DEA spokesman David Aus-
iello said people across the country 
flocked to more than 4,000 sites to get rid of old drugs and just about 
anything they got with a prescrip-
tion that they didn’t need any more, including needles.
Authorities said a woman in 
Jacksonville, Ill., handed over drugs she’s collected for the last 50 years while a man in Troy, Mo., hauled a kitchen drawer packed with medi-cine to a drop-off site.
It’s illegal to turn over unused 
prescriptions to anyone other than law enforcement. But the House and Senate have passed legislation 
allowing state and private entities 
to create responsible drug take-back programs. The bill awaits President 
Barack Obama’s signature.
Ausiello said DEA officials are 
likely to hold at least one more take-back day before any legisla-
tion takes effect.
During the six years ending in 
2006, there was a 175 percent 
increase in acci-
dental prescrip-
tion overdoses, according to fed-
eral data.
By 2009, 7 mil-
lion Americans aged 12 and old-
er abused prescription drugs for 
non-medical purposes. That was 
up from 6.3 million in 2008.
Unsure of what to do with 
unused prescriptions, countless 
people flush them down the toi-let, potentially sending unwanted 
medicines into the water supply. Or 
worse, they throw old medicines out, giving drug-seeking criminals a chance to find them in the trash.
The take-back program, Aus-
iello said, gave federal authorities a chance to collect and then inciner -
ate the drugs.Prescription take-back 
nets 121 tons of drugs� THE JUDGE HAD BEEN 
PAYING THE EXOTIC DANCER FOR SEX.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
ATLANTA — A veteran fed-
eral judge faces drug and firearms 
charges after an exotic dancer at an Atlanta strip club told authori-ties he used cocaine, marijuana and 
other illegal drugs with her.
Senior U.S. District Judge Jack T. 
Camp was arrested Friday minutes 
after he handed an undercover law enforcement agent $160 for cocaine and Roxycodone, a narcotic pain medication, that he intended to use with the exotic dancer, authori-
ties said in a court 
document released 
Monday. They said they also found two firearms in the front 
seat of his vehicle.
Camp, 67, who has presided 
over some high-profile cases, was released Monday on a $50,000 bond. His attorney, William Mor -
rison, said after a brief hearing that the judge intends to plead not guilty. Morrison said Camp would probably take a leave of absence and would not preside over any more cases until the charges are re-solved.
“This is really a case between Judge Camp and his wife,” said 
Morrison. “It’s not about Judge 
Camp being a judge. It’s about him being a husband.”
Camp’s arrest set up an un-usual domino effect in the federal 
courthouse. The district’s federal 
judges all recused themselves, so Magistrate Judge Charles S. Coody of Alabama was brought in to hear the case. Federal prosecutors from 
Washington also flew in to handle 
the government’s arguments.
The charges against Camp were 
laid out in a shocking eight-page af-fidavit released after the emergency 
hearing was finished.
Camp met the informant, who 
recently began cooperating with 
the FBI, at the Goldrush Showbar in Atlanta in early 2010 and he soon began paying her for sex and buy-ing cocaine from her at $40 to $50 a pop, according to the records.
In June 2010, Camp followed the 
confidential informant to a drug dealer in Marietta to buy Roxy-codone. He was also recorded in a wiretapped telephone call on Sept. 28 talking with her about getting together over the weekend to split more pills and cocaine with her, ac-cording to the charges.
He showed up at a Publix park-
ing lot in northeast Atlanta around 7:15 p.m. Friday to meet with the an undercover agent posing as the dealer. When the informant told her she was worried about his safe-ty, the judge told her, “I not only have my little pistol, I’ve got my big pistol so, uh, we’ll take care of any problems that come up,” according 
to the affidavit.
He handed over $160 in cash to 
pay for the drugs around 7:35 p.m. 
Ten minutes later, authorities ar -
rested the judge and seized the two guns from the front seat of his ve-hicle.
The judge faces four drug-relat-
ed charges and one count of pos-
sessing firearms while illegally us-
ing drugs.Stripper’s tip leads to judge’s drug, gun charges

meant they had to chase (Flor -
ida) and paid off for us late in 
the game.”
With less than 30 seconds 
left in the Gators’ win against 
the Rebels, forward McKenzie 
Barney put a ball in the back of the net, keeping her streak of consecutive home games with a goal alive at nine.
Two days before, Barney 
had snapped the school record of seven matches, held by Abby Wambach and Sarah Yohe.
But while Barney has had a 
brilliant 2010 campaign, Annis has been the Gators’ unsung hero.
She has played just 15 fewer 
minutes than Barney this sea-son, and while Barney leads the team in points (21) and goals (nine), Annis is second on the team in both categories with 19 points and seven goals. 
Annis already eclipsed her 
goals, assists and points totals from last season. This year, she leads the team in shots taken 
and shots on goal, and she is 
tied for second in assists with five.
Annis and the Gators now 
head off on the road again to play Alabama on Friday and Auburn on Sunday.  
After four well-played SEC 
matches, the Gators look to 
stay undefeated in the confer -
ence as they get ready for their 
toughest SEC road games thus far.
Alabama is first in the SEC 
West, and Auburn has one of the most impressive players in the conference in midfielder Katy Frierson, who has been named to the All-SEC team the past two years. 
“Our team gained a lot of 
confidence this weekend,” Bur -
leigh said. “But we know that we have to have a strong com-mitment to defense in order to beat these two teams. On the road especially, your defense is 
what generates your offense.”
She added: “It’s great to 
play at a high level, and it’s 
great to play well at home, but you have to play at a high level week in and week out. And that’s the key for us. If we keep continuing to do that we will have good results.”14, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2010

Dolphins special teams coordinator John Bonamego was fired Tuesday 
after his unit had two field goals blocked against the Patriots.THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
DAVIE — The prime-time meltdown by the Mi-
ami Dolphins’ special teams cost an assistant coach his job.
Only 12 hours after a calamitous performance 
against the New England Patriots, the Dolphins fired special teams coordinator John Bonamego on Tuesday.
Special teams cost Miami 21 points in a 41-14 
loss Monday night. Two blocked kicks led to touch-downs, and the Patriots returned a kickoff 103 yards for another score.
The Dolphins (2-2) also had a punt blocked a 
week earlier in a loss to the New York Jets. The back-to-back divisional defeats dropped Miami to third place in the AFC East.
Assistant special teams coach Darren Rizzi 
will replace Bonamego, coach Tony Sparano said. Bonamego was in his 12th NFL season and had been with the Dolphins since Sparano became head coach in 2008.
“It’s a hard decision to make,” Sparano said. “I 
know how hard this guy works. Nobody works harder than him at what he does.”
Unlike Bonamego, quarterback Chad Henne won’t 
lose his job. Sparano said he’ll stick with Henne de-spite an erratic three-interception performance that accelerated the Dolphins’ self-destruction.
While the turnovers hurt, the lapses by 
Bonamego’s units doomed the Dolphins. The Pa-triots trailed 7-6 before Brandon Tate returned the second-half kickoff untouched for a score. Patrick Chung blocked a punt to set up a touchdown, then blocked a field goal that Kyle Arrington returned 35 yards for a touchdown  to give the Patriots a 34-14 lead early in the fourth quarter.“We shot ourselves in the foot,” Miami corner -
back Jason Allen said. “You can’t expect to win when you’re playing a team like — actually, any team. I don’t care who you’re playing, when we do 
the things we did.”
Linebacker Tim Dobbins plays on special teams 
and said he was embarrassed.
“We all should be,” he said. “We let the whole 
team down.”
Patriots coach Bill Belichick didn’t seem surprised 
to hear of Bonamego’s firing.
“I don’t think probably much of anything that 
happens in the league these days is a surprise or 
unheard of,” Belichick said. “It’s unfortunate. ... I’m 
sure those decisions aren’t easy.”
The Dolphins rank last in the NFL in punting, last 
in kickoff coverage and 25th in kickoff re-
turns. Continual turnover at the bottom of the roster may contribute to the Dol-
phins’ special teams woes — in the past 
month, they’ve made 19 roster moves.
“That’s part of the special teams chal-
lenge, when you bring new players in and you get 
them involved,” Sparano said.
The succession of breakdowns against New Eng-
land resulted in the Dolphins’ most lopsided defeat since 2007, when they went 1-15. They lost even though they outgained the Patriots by 135 yards, limited them to 146 yards passing and held Randy 
Moss without a catch.
The Dolphins have a bye this week, then resume 
a rugged stretch in the schedule. Their next six op-ponents are a combined 16-8.
Sparano said he expects the Dolphins to bounce 
back from the drubbing. Belichick does, too.
“Miami is a good team,” Belichick said. “I am 
sure we haven’t heard the last of them.”Miami fires special teams coordinator after debacle

agrees with me vehemently, saying 
there has been no talk of moving him back to guard. 
“Absolutely not. Are you kid-
ding me?” Addazio asked rhe-
torically , incredulous at the idea. 
“We’re talking about a first-round draft pick, the best offensive line-man in America and a phenomenal football player. And the leader on this football (team). Absolutely, un-equivocally, never even entered the realm of possibility.”
I then asked Addazio if he feels 
Pouncey was better at guard than he is at center. Again, no amount of Madden or fantasy football could make me understand his response. 
“He grades out a champion ev-
ery week. Absolutely not,” Addazio said. “I guess if you want to start talking about: Is there a low snap? We’re not gonna go down the path 
of a good football player, now. Or 
playing great right now? You won’t want to play against him. We’ll leave it there.”
I can’t argue with one thing: I 
definitely would not want to play against Mike Pouncey . But the fact that Pouncey would absolutely manhandle me doesn’t exactly get 
at the core of this discussion. 
As for the option, I was even 
more off the mark on that one. 
Every time I watched an Ala-
bama defender come from the 
backside of the play and run down John Brantley on an option, I thought it was a poor football deci-sion to have a quarterback who is not a good runner (by his own ad-mission) run the option. Not so. 
“You need to have an element 
of option in your game so that you 
can keep the defense balanced and 
keep the defense honest,” Addazio said, noting that Brantley option plays have averaged five yards per carry according to his calcula-tions. “And it’s a part of who we are. That wont change. How many calls? That’s going to be dictated by what we’re seeing and what’s hap-
pening.”
Urban Meyer said essentially 
the same thing Monday , and I agree 
with both of them. Keep some op-tion in your offense. But don’t have John Brantley run it. Maybe even mix in one or two option plays for Brantley , just to keep the defense honest. But running him four to 
five times a game on the option isn’t 
something I would do in NCAA 
Football ‘10.  Just sayin’.
From what I understand — not 
much these days, apparently — 
most of the people who watch Flor -
ida play every week, be they media or fans, see things more or less the same way I do. 
But the vast majority of “us” 
never played the game. Not at this level. 
And that will forever be the 
justification for why people like us can’t possible understand why an All-American lineman who strug-gles to snap the football is best used at center, and why a passing quar -
terback who struggles to run the football needs to be running the op-
tion a handful of times per game. 
We just wouldn’t understand. KYLE , from page 14

lot of confidence this

that we have to have a

Alabama’s Alex Clay.
UF TENNIS

Alligator Writer
 
The Gators went undefeated 
in the first round of qualifying at 
the ITA All-American in Pacific Palisades, Calif., on Tuesday.
Freshmen Sofie Oyen and Al-
exandra Cercone each impressed with wins against top-100 oppo-nents. 
Oyen, who earned a spot in 
the qualifying draw after anoth-er player withdrew, took on No. 60 Jenifer Widjaja of Pacific and defeated the redshirt senior in 
straight sets (6-3, 6-3). 
Cercone also faced a tough 
opponent in No. 75 Sarah Lands-
man of Arizona. Although Cer -
cone dropped her first set, she battled back and won in three sets (1-6, 7-5, 6-2). 
Coach Roland Thornqvist is 
pleased with the way his team 
has performed so far, particular -
ly its young players.
“This is Sofie’s first tourna-
ment with us,” he said. “I think both her and Alex have played 
decent. They continue to get bet-ter each round.” 
Thornqvist said even with 
their success, both players still 
have plenty of room for improve-
ment.“We try to assess the matches 
more on how they play and how they perform rather than if they win or lose,” he said. “I think that’s very important for devel-opment.” 
Sophomore Caroline Hiti-
mana picked up a difficult three-set win, beating Alabama’s Alex Clay (1-6, 7-5, 7-3). 
And Joanna Mather com-
pleted the sweep, easily taking down No. 42 Shannon Mathews of Notre Dame (6-0, 6-2).
Thornqvist said Mather has 
exhibited maturity and leader -
ship both on and off the court, 
something her teammates feed 
off. 
Her steady play so far hasn’t 
hurt, either. 
“She’s playing the best tennis 
of her career,” he said. “Her game right now is as good as it’s ever been with the Florida Gators.” 
All four competitors were 
scheduled to compete in the second round later Tuesday, but none had started their matches as of press time due to a rain delay.
First-time success for men’s 
duo: Playing together for the first time, the Gators’ team of Sekou Bangoura Jr. and Billy Federhofer 
picked up two wins in qualifying 
doubles at the ITA All-American. 
The duo defeated Nebraska’s 
Christopher Aumueller and Calin Paar 8-6 to move on to the 
second round, where they took 
down Illinois State’s pair of Alex-ander Pelaez and Timon Reichelt (8-6) later Tuesday.
Unfortunately for the Gators, 
their singles competitors did not fare as well.
After recording UF’s first dou-
ble-bagel victory in more than a 
year Monday, junior Nassim Slil-
am could not continue his string of success, losing to Nebraska’s Benedikt Lindheim in straight 
sets (6-4, 6-4). 
Bangoura also lost 6-4, 6-4 
to Artem Baradach of Southern 
Methodist. 
The lone Gator left in singles 
action is Alexandre Lacroix, who will begin play in the main draw Thursday.Gators women sweep first round
UF not giving up on option play; Henry still adapting to kicking FGs
defense honest and it’s a part of who we 
are,” he said. “That won’t change. How many calls? That’s going to be dictated by what we’re seeing and what’s happen-
ing.” 
Florida has struggled at times to run the 
play. Opposing defenses have been able to 
cheat on the pitch option because the ju-nior quarterback doesn’t pose much of a threat to run the ball. 
Coach Urban Meyer agreed with UF’s offensive coordinator but also knows the offense must get better with the option.
“Do you eliminate it? Or do you im-
prove upon it?,” Meyer said. “History shows that we usually put a premium on improving it and getting it better. To say it’s going to be eliminated, that’s not going to happen.” 
Henry pulling double duty: A punter 
provided Florida with something positive 
to talk about this week after a disappoint-
ing loss to Alabama on Saturday.
Chas Henry knocked in 39- and 21-yard field goals against Alabama in place of in-jured kicker Caleb Sturgis (back). He also booted three punts for an average of 62.3 
yards, including one that traveled 75 yards.
But he noticed the intri-
cate differences between the two positions.
“In punting I have 50 
yards to work with, the whole field — a lit-
tle bit less with directional punts. But still, 
you have a little room for error,” he said. “With field goals, it’s definitely a little bit more. You have to do the whole aim-small, miss-small thing.” 
Meyer said Henry’s field-goal range 
heading into last week’s game went up to 42 yards. 
That could change this week and as the 
season progresses since Henry may be a long-term replacement.
“You start trying to do a little bit too 
much on the leg strength and you start 
pulling away from the accuracy,” Henry 
said. “We’ll figure [my range] out this week.”

POLL QUESTION TWITTER UF VOLLEYBALL CASINOS PULLED THE UF-LSU MATCHUP FROM 
BETTING BOARDS BECAUSE OF HIS INJURY.

Alligator Staff Writers

Florida quarterback John Brantley was limited in 
practice Sunday after taking a hard hit against Alabama, 
but offensive coordinator Steve Addazio said the junior 
should be fine for this weekend’s meeting with LSU.
“He’s doing great,” Addazio said.
Brantley remained on the ground for more than a min-
ute after being sandwiched between Crimson Tide safety 
Mark Barron and linebacker C.J. Mosley. He motioned to-ward his right side when joined by team doctors, but he 
didn’t miss a play.
“I’m a little sore, but that’s just like every game,” Brant-
ley said Monday. “I’m not feeling anything that would 
stop me or not allow me to do anything.”
Still, fears that Brantley’s apparent rib injury is more 
serious were strong enough that casinos in Las Vegas pulled the matchup between the No. 14 Gators and No. 12 Tigers from betting boards Tuesday.
The injury came on a fourth-quarter scramble, but 
Brantley also had several designed runs and picked up 19 yards on five carries, not counting sacks or fumbles. 
Gators sticking to option game: The option isn’t going 
anywhere.
Despite Brantley’s lack of mobility, Addazio reiterated 
his confidence in the play while pointing out the Gators are averaging five yards per carry in the option game this 
season.

Fresh off two shutouts to start 
Southeastern Conference play, the 
road-weary No. 6 Gators returned 
home this weekend with one thing in mind: capitalizing on scoring opportunities. 
The focus paid off, as Florida 
(10-1-1, 4-0 SEC) netted more goals against Mississippi State and Ole Miss than in the previous five matches combined.
“We were relentless,” midfield-
er Tahnai Annis said. “We got what we needed to start the SEC.”
Last season, the Gators lost to 
the Rebels and tied the Bulldogs on the road in what coach Becky Burleigh referred to as “the trip to 
the ’Sip.” This weekend, Florida 
put up a plethora of goals, outscor -
ing their opponents 10-1, a season high for total goals in a weekend. 
Florida’s victory over Ole Miss 
was the first time since 2004 the match between the two was de-
cided by more 
than one goal.
“Friday was 
a great night for 
goal produc-tion,” Burleigh 
said. “It was a great way to start the weekend. Sunday, we were able to keep the ball a lot, which Overshadowed Annis 
key to Gators’ offense  During the fall, I probably watch some-
where between 10-15 hours of college and professional football every weekend. 
I’ve seen every Florida football game since 
2006. For the past two years, I’ve even covered the 
team, doing interviews about five times a week. 
And yet, listening to some of the players and 
coaches talk on a near daily basis, I’ve come to re-
alize that there are things I will never understand about the Gators.
Which is surprising because I’d put my foot-
ball credentials up against anyone who takes the field wearing orange and blue every Saturday — player or coach.  
In addition to all my football-watching (film 
session), I have completed multiple undefeated 
Madden and NCAA Football seasons (play-call-
ing), quarterbacked an intramural flag football team on various playoff runs (execution) and cur -
rently manage four fantasy football teams (talent evaluation). 
OK, so I’m no Bear Bry-
ant. 
But I should be able 
to understand why Mike 
Pouncey is a better fit at 
center than guard, and why running the option with John Brantley a hand-ful of times every game is a good thing.
Mike Pouncey is what 
the kids would call a “baller.” He was an All-American guard a year ago, one of the funniest/most thoughtful guys on the team and an unques-tioned  leader. 
What he isn’t, in my humble opinion, is good 
at snapping a football.

me or not allow me to do anything.”
