  The Ronald McDonald House of 
Gainesville will need some helping hands 
next week.
  The organization will need volunteers 
from noon to 2 p.m. Feb. 21 and 23 to move 51 mattresses and 51 box springs from stor-age containers into its 31 guest rooms, said Theresa Drews, house operations director at Gainesville’s Ronald McDonald House.
  Tempur-Pedic donated the beds Mon-day. The Ronald McDonald House pro-vides temporary housing for families with critically ill children receiving treatment at Gainesville hospitals.
  Mike Mason, the director of brand de-
velopment and integration at Tempur-Pedic, said the company was eager to pro-vide mattresses for families staying at the house because they are in need of a good night’s sleep.
  “We give people their best night’s 
sleep,” Mason said. “So there is this great connection between what we do and the charity.”
  The brand became an ofﬁ  cial sponsor 
for the charity in January 2010. Since then, Tempur-Pedic has donated about 2,500 beds, Mason said.  Tempur-Pedic’s goal is to replace beds 
at every Ronald McDonald House in the U.S. by 2014, he said.
  Drews said she knows the importance 
of the loving and comfortable atmosphere the houses provide. Three years ago, she stayed at the Chicago house while her 14-year-old nephew was being treated for brain cancer at the Children’s Memorial Hospital.
  Mason hopes other companies and in-
dividuals will follow suit in donating their time and resources to charities.
  “It really is about doing the right thing,” 
he said.

  UF freshman Christie Fleeman and her 
three roommates arrived at their Beaty East apartment last fall, determined to make it as homey as possible.
  Next fall semester, Fleeman, 18, may 
have to start over in Beaty West.  Fleeman, and about 377 other stu-
dents living in Beaty East will not be able to continue living there during the 2012-13 academic year because it will house Innovation Academy students.
  Innovation Academy is an enrollment 
model in which students attend classes on campus only during spring and summer semesters. The ﬁ  rst Innovation Academy class will arrive in Spring 2013.
  Fleeman said she did not know about  Spring-summer students 
to move to Beaty East

  University Police are investigating a second 
possible hazing case that occurred two years ago.
  As police investigated a hazing incident re-
ported Feb. 4, a second incident was reported to police Monday.
  According to the UPD crime log, the hazing 
may have occurred between April 2010 and late January 2011. Ofﬁ  cials said the case involves a Greek organization.   Police have not released many details on either incident  
  The incident reported Feb. 4  involved an 
individual hoping to become part of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Ofﬁ  cials said the student suf-fered visible injuries, but hospitalization was not required. Sources with knowledge of the situation said the hazing may have involved beatings.
  The UF chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha was 
temporarily suspended last week as police in-vestigate.
  UF’s antihazing task force met Tuesday to 
talk about measures to educate students and parents about hazing, including posting past hazing incidents on student organizations’ websites and inviting students to work with the task force to discuss the issue.   Considering re-cent events, the group also agreed to start meet-ing every two weeks.  UPD investigates second

One of the world’s largest res-
taurant chains is taking steps to 
improve living conditions for pregnant pigs in its pork supply facilities.
McDonald’s Corp. announced 
Wednesday that it will require its U.S. pork suppliers to submit plans to phase out individual stalls for the pigs by May, a decision supported by the Humane Society of the United States.
“There are alternatives that we 
think are better for the welfare of sows,” said Dan Gorsky, senior vice president of McDonald’s North America Supply Chain Manage-ment, in a statement. “McDonald’s wants to see the end of sow con-finement in gestation stalls in our supply chain.”
The decision came after years of 
talks between McDonald’s and the Humane Society and from the fast-food chain’s analysis of how the stalls affect the animals, said Josh Balk, a spokesman for the Humane Society.
Balk said sows spend a major-
ity of their lives confined in 2-by-7-foot metal cages, which give them little room to move around and are considered inhumane by animal rights groups.He said the use of gestation 
stalls by pork suppliers is banned in the European Union and in eight U.S. states, including Florida.
“It’s cruel and inhumane to 
permanently confine an animal in a cage so cramped she can’t even turn around,” he said.
Balk said an alternative to gesta-
tion stalls would be to move preg-nant sows to open pen houses.
“Pigs are built to move, and in 
order to have proper welfare they should at least be able to walk around and turn around and so-cialize with other pigs,” he said.
The pork industry does not see 
McDonald’s decision in the same light as the Human Society.
Dave Warner, a spokesman for 
the National Pork Producers Coun-cil, said moving sows from stalls to pens has its disadvantages.
“If you put 10 pregnant sows in 
a room or pen, they get mean,” he said. “They will attack each other and bite in places where, as a sow, you really wouldn’t want to get bitten.”
Sows in open pens also pose a 
worker-safety issue, he added.
Sam Kowalczyk, a 21-year-old 
nuclear engineering junior, said he’s concerned with the issue of sanitation if sows are moved from individual stalls to group pens.
“I’m all for McDonald’s exercis-
ing their decision of where they get their food from,” he said. “As long as it’s safe.”

After winning $100,000 for children’s 
health last year, basketball coach Billy Dono-
van is back in the game.
This year, Donovan will participate in ES-
PN’s second Infiniti Coaches’ Charity Chal-lenge. He is vying to get enough online votes to raise money for the Sebastian Ferrero Foundation, which donates money to the ex-pansion of Shands Hospital for Children at UF. He supported the same cause last year.
Fred Demarest, UF assistant athletics di-
rector and spokesman, said the foundation remains an important charity to Donovan.
“It’s a charity that’s very close to his 
heart,” Demarest said.
The number of participating coaches 
jumped to 48 from last year’s 14.As of Tuesday, Dono-
van was in second place in the southern region, with 23 percent of the votes.
Voters can pick one 
coach per region online 
at ESPN’s website each day until Feb. 27. Voting among the final four will 
continue until March 8.Each coach will earn $5,000 for his char -
ity of choice, and the winning coach’s charity will receive $100,000.
Last July, the Sebastian Ferrero Foun-
dation used money from the competition to create a new pediatric emergency room at Shands at UF, said Linda Michalisin, a spokeswoman for the foundation.
“Coach Donovan’s support has been criti-
cal,” she said.Donovan takes second shot at charity challenge, seeks votes online

Beaty East residents who re-applied for housing were given priority
the change until her housing 
sign-up date.
“I found out about the dis-
placement because someone in my floor received an email and told us what was going to hap-pen,” she said.
Jennifer Todden, residence 
life coordinator for Beaty Towers and Jennings Hall, sent the email explaining the Innovation Acad-
emy program.
The Department of Housing 
and Residence Education held a 
Q&A session for residents, said Carolynn Komanski, assistant di-rector of housing for administra-tive services.
Fleeman said she enjoys 
Beaty’s central location and was upset when she found out about the changes.
“I was worried that because only one tower would be open there would not be enough rooms available,” she said.However, the news will not 
interfere with her future living arrangements.“I kind of wanted to stay in 
my same room because I like the view,” she said. “But it didn’t re-ally change my plans that much because I just decided to live in Beaty West.”
Komanski said the Depart-
ment of Housing and Residence Education assigned the Innova-tion Academy students to Beaty East on Dec. 16. 
Current residents received dis-
placement notices prior to room sign-up week.
Residents of Beaty East who 
re-applied for campus housing were given priority for room se-lection.
Beaty East will house overflow 
students with late application dates and students who sign con-tracts only for Fall 2012.
The Department of Housing 
and Residence Education hasn’t determined if Beaty East will house students from Innovation Academy after 2013.
“The department will have to 
evaluate the success of the pro-gram and demand for student housing,” Komanski said. “At this time we have not determined what facilities will be for Innova-tion Academy for 2014 and on-ward. However, we will house students for this new academic term.”BEATY , from page 14, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 2012

The Florida Senate recently 
rejected a bill that would allow 
some children of undocument-ed immigrants to pay in-state tuition, but hope for immi-grants might not be lost.
Another bill, which would 
allow students who immigrat-ed to the U.S. illegally to pay in-state tuition, is scheduled for debate in the state legisla-ture on Friday.
The bill, SB106, would al-
low those students to pay resident tuition if they attend high school in Florida for three years, graduate from a Florida high school, register at a Flori-da college or university and file an affidavit with the university promising to file for residency or citizenship.
The bill, offered by Sen. 
Gary Siplin, D-Orlando, last year, only made it past the judiciary committee. Siplin brought it back this year in an attempt to level the playing field for all students who were educated in the Florida school system, said Siplin’s legislative assistant Lakeisha Hood.
The issue is also close to Si-
plin’s heart, Hood said.
Siplin’s wife emigrated 
from Haiti and attended school in Florida, but because she wasn’t a citizen, she was forced to pay out-of-state tu-ition for college.
Although the bill would al-
low undocumented students to be considered Florida resi-dents for financial reasons, the measure wouldn’t protect against deportation.
However, she said, the le-
gal-status affidavit would be handled only by the university 
where the student is enrolled.
“The af-
fidavit isn’t going to send up a red flag to ICE [U.S. Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement] that they’re undocumented,” she said.
Nichole Teixeira, assistant 
public relations director for the UF immigrant advocacy group CHISPAS, said the bill would benefit Florida’s economy by allowing more students the opportunity to get college de-grees.
Without the bill, most un-
documented students, who don’t qualify for state-funded financial aid, wouldn’t be able to pay tuition.
“It sets them up for failure,” 
she said. State Senate to discuss

Two women were charged 
with domestic battery Monday 
night.
Laurie Bowlen, a 28-year-old 
claims adjuster, attacked her hus-band after she found him talking to another woman in a car, and Rebecca McKenzy, a 25-year-old Gainesville Regional Utilities employee, fought with her ex-husband because he had her cell-phone, according to a Gainesville Police Department arrest report.
In the first incident, Laurie 
found her husband, Brent, talking to Jennifer Cruikshank, a friend, in a car in the driveway of the couple’s home.Brent got out, and the couple 
argued.
Laurie suspected her husband 
was behaving inappropriately with Cruikshank, and according to the report, Brent then grabbed his wife. He was concerned she would “do something stupid,” like attack Cruikshank.
A GPD officer arrived at 9:55 
p.m. in response to a suspicious activity call, and he saw Brent holding his wife. The officer de-manded Brent let her go, but Lau-rie bit her husband’s right arm be-fore he could. She was arrested.
According to the report, 
Bowlen said she bit him so he would release her.
The other instance of domestic 
battery Monday night involved Rebecca and Latroy McKenzy. The two have have been in a re-lationship for 10 years and mar -
ried for five. According to a police report, they’ve been separated for the last three months.
Around 5:30 p.m., the two were 
arguing in Latroy’s apartment, and according to the report, Re-becca grabbed her ex-husband’s ears and hair and hit him on the back to get her cellphone. Latroy then pushed her out of his apart-ment.
After the fight, there was dried 
blood behind Latroy’s left ear where his ex-wife had grabbed him, the report said.
Laurie Bowlen and Rebecca 
McKenzy were both released without bail Tuesday at 1:10 p.m.

A routine traffic stop turned into a drug bust Monday 
night when an Alachua County Sheriff’s deputy found 
1.8 pounds of marijuana under a car’s hood.
Harvey K. Mason, 21, of Williston, and his room-
mate, Louis K. Marks, 20, were charged with marijuana possession with intent to sell. They were both being held at Alachua County Jail as of Tuesday night.
Deputy Victor Borrero stopped Mason’s white Jeep 
at 17000 SW 134th Ave. on Monday night because one of the Jeep’s taillights was blocking the license plate. After Mason stopped, Borrero could smell the marijuana, ac-cording to an arrest report.Borrero asked him about the smell, and Mason ad-
mitted he kept a small bag of marijuana under one of his seats. Borrero searched Mason and found a small scale in his pocket, which the officer suspected Mason used for weighing drugs.
When Borrero searched the car, he found a small 
green vial under the passenger’s seat. He asked whom it belonged to.
“Mine!” Mason and Marks said at the same time, ac-
cording to the arrest report.
They told Borrero they drove around Gainesville on 
Monday night looking for “quality weed” and bought the drugs for $25, according to police.
Borrero continued to search the car. After he opened 
the hood of the Jeep, he found a green bag on the driver’s side engine compartment, according to the report.
Inside, he found a white bag. Inside the white bag, he 
found two Ziploc bags containing a total of 1.8 pounds of marijuana.Traffic stop yields 1.8 pounds of pot

Satire site College Humor ranked UF No. 2 on its 
list of the top 10 biggest slacker colleges in the U.S., 
according to a Huffington Post story.
It said students at the schools on the list maxi-
mize fun while minimizing effort.
Pennsylvania State University topped the list. 
Virginia Tech came in at No. 3, followed by the Uni-versity of Oklahoma and Auburn University.
Educational consultant Steven Antonoff, who 
wrote “The College Finder,” a book containing more than 700 college-related lists, disapproves of the rankings.
“I don’t know that there are ways to measure 
slacker-ness,” he said.
Antonoff likened the slacker list to the Princeton 
Review’s party school rankings.
UF is the only Florida school ranked, but five 
Southeastern Conference universities made the list.
The popularity of football could be to blame for 
UF’s ranking, said 21-year-old English junior Will Henry.
“I think this is such a big football and partying 
school, you kind of get the feeling that nobody’s do-ing any work,” he said.
Blair Erich, a 21-year-old psychology senior, said 
UF students know how to balance work and play.
“We’re winners,” she said. “We’re always happy, 
always partying.”UF ranked No. 2

OPINIONS EDITORToday’s question: Do you enjoy swing dancing?
87 TOTAL VOTES76% YES
24% NOTuesday’s question: Did you enjoy the 
cooler weather? US should not support armed conflict 
With tension between Israel and Iran so heated that armed conflict seems inevitable, the U.S. military must decide on a plan of action should combat 
arise, and it must decide soon.
According to the Washington Post, U.S. Defense Sec-
retary Leon Panetta believes there is a “strong likelihood” that Israel will strike Iran in April, May or June.
The conflict between the two nations stems largely from 
Iran’s nuclear program. In short, Israel doesn’t want Iran to have nuclear power.
The words “Iran” and “Israel” conjure up two images: 
one of a backward, malevolent country and one of a civil, peaceful country. How could it be otherwise when rocket attacks from one country are called terrorism but occupa-tion and incursions by another are accepted or ignored?
Consider the U.S.’s hostility toward Iran. At the South 
Carolina Republican Presidential Debate, candidate Rick Santorum said, “There have been scientists turning up dead in Russia and in Iran. … I hope that the United States has been involved with that.”
According to Santorum, who needs trial by jury or even 
a criminal accusation? When U.S. presidential candidates support the assassination of unarmed, nonviolent scien-tists, it’s easy to see why Iran would want to equip itself with nuclear weapons.
Indeed, the conflict surrounding Iran’s nuclear program 
is difficult and can’t be entirely attributed to one country. If anything, the aggressor, at the moment, is Israel. Israel likely has access to nuclear weaponry, and it is Israel that appears most likely to open warfare to stop Iran’s nuclear program.
This weekend, during the celebration of the 33rd anni-
versary of the Iranian Revolution, Iranian President Mah-moud Ahmadinejad made a major announcement: “In the coming days, the world will witness Iran’s announcement of its very important and very major nuclear achievements.”
These nuclear achievements, if real, are important, con-sidering that Iran’s nuclear ambi-tions have been the target of op-position from many nations. As Ahmadinejad put it, “All coun-tries have put pressure on us for not obtaining nuclear know-how, but all these pressures are futile.”
Iran’s possession of nuclear 
weaponry may prove to be the greatest source of peace for the 
Middle East. Nuclear weapons are primarily facilitators of deterrence, not combat. If Israel and Iran both know that the other has nuclear power, they will avoid war at all costs. It is similar to the circumstance of the Cold War: Mutually assured destruction will prevent either side from taking ac-tion.
Although it may be too much to expect the U.S. not to 
blindly back Israel, our loyalty should lie with ourselves alone.
There is a horribly mistaken notion that there are certain 
civilities of war: that massacre is civil as long as the mur -
derers and victims are wearing their country’s uniforms, or that one death, 100 deaths or 1 million deaths are acceptable as long as they are the result of adherence to the protocol of the Geneva Conventions.
As absurd as this notion sounds, this is how war is 
practiced today. Warfare of any kind is the vilest, wicked-est action humans can take on each other. There is no civil warfare.
Thus, the United States should not jump into any con-
flict with Iran. War has become a farce, with the U.S. seem-ing to involve itself in some new conflict every year. But war with Iran would be far from a farce, and the U.S.’s only goal for this conflict should be to establish peace between Israel and Iran.

Tuition Tumult
Student residency 
should determine rate 
Last semester, we wrote an editorial in favor of a bill 
that would grant in-state tuition status to students who were children of illegal immigrants. The bill re-
quired those students to attend a Florida high school for four consecutive years and plan to enroll in college within 12 months of graduation in Florida.
Well, Florida Sen. Steve Oelrich, who chairs the the Sen-
ate Higher Education Committee, made sure the bill did not make it to the Senate floor.
In response, protesters gathered outside the senator’s of-
fice at the end of last week to encourage him to change his mind on this issue.
Oelrich defended his position to the protesters, saying it 
was a “tradition” in Florida to award in-state tuition based on the residency of the parents rather than the children.
He gave the example of his son, who goes to school in 
Colorado but pays out-of-state tuition because his parents live in Florida.
According the Associated Press, Oelrich also opposed 
the bill because it allowed students attending high schools near Florida’s border to receive in-state tuition even if their parents lived in another state.
But Oelrich is missing the point.The students who attend school in Florida but whose 
parents live in Georgia can still go to a school in Georgia and pay in-state tuition.
What choice do the children of undocumented immi-
grants have? Their parents came to the U.S. through the back door, leaving their children with no choice for an af-fordable education.
As we argued in our previous editorial about this issue, 
we should be careful not to place all the blame on the par -
ents.
Our immigration system has many structural flaws that 
encourage illegal entry. The fact is, coming through the front door is extremely difficult, especially for people from non-Western countries. Our work visa system is strictly limited, and there is virtually no path to citizenship for unskilled laborers in this country.
In spite of all of this, it is still not the fault of the children 
that their parents came to the country without taking the legal, albeit cumbersome and nearly impossible, route.
These students would still have been required to attend 
school in Florida and would likely become upstanding citi-zens as a result of their chance to receive an education.
Otherwise, students who are the children of illegal immi-
grants would have to work in the state at a minimum-wage job for a full year before they could receive in-state tuition.
This not only puts them at a disadvantage compared to 
other students, but it also means that many might be dis-couraged from ever attending college in the first place.
Our policies should not discourage those people actively 
seeking to further their educations because of the actions of their parents.

The Alachua County Commission de-
cided Tuesday to consider the costs of using 
other energy providers after learning that Gainesville Regional Utility’s biomass con-tract will increase the county’s utility bill.
Charlie Jackson, Alachua County facili-
ties manager, said the biomass plant, which will burn wood to generate electricity, would cause the county utility bill to jump by about $200,000 a year starting in 2014. Utility bills currently amount to about $3 million, said Alachua County spokesman Mark Sexton.
The commission has not taken an official 
stance in support or opposition of Gaines-ville’s decision to sign a $3.1 billion biomass contract, he said.  
However, when the commission heard 
about the utility rate increase for its own buildings, it voted unanimously to have county staff look into the cost of other en-ergy providers and research how much sur -
rounding counties pay for electricity.
“My motivation here is to be able to draw 
a conclusion personally that our rates really are higher, lower or the same than others,” Commissioner Paula DeLaney said.
Commissioner Lee Pinkoson analyzed 
electricity costs in other counties and asked if it was possible to switch energy provid-ers.
Other energy companies under consider -
ation such as Progress Energy, which pro-vides most of the electricity to UF, and Clay Electric Co-op may cost less, he said.Commissioner Susan Baird said the coun-
ty should examine other ways to generate electricity in an effort to keep utility rates low for residents and prospective business owners who want to come to Gainesville.
“Business utility bills are going to go up 
significantly,” Baird said. “If you see high utility costs, you aren’t going to want to come here.”
While Interim County 
Manager Rick Drum-mond said he understood 
the commission’s concern for increased utility rates among residents and busi-
nesses in the county, he said the cost analy-sis will focus on impacts to the county gov-ernment and its utility bills.“We are really honing in on impact to 
Alachua County government as opposed to doing an analysis on the impact on eco-nomic opportunity in Alachua County as a whole,” Drummond said.
Six county residents stood at the meet-
ing and spoke against the biomass plan, in-cluding City Commission at-large 1 candi-date Nathan Skop, who built his part of his campaign around opposition to the biomass contract.
Gainesville resident Paula Stamer said 
she appreciated that the County Commis-sion discussed the contract and allowed public comment.   
“Citizens in Gainesville have had abso-
lutely no success in getting the city to dis-cuss this issue,” Stamer said. “Thank you for letting us talk.”

Bailey, chief of ACFR, and the Ala-

Bailey said the wrecks were the worst he had ever seen in his 36 years in public safety.
Some in the room were law enforce-
ment and public safety officials who responded to the accident scene. That day, officers, firefighters and paramed-ics were blinded by the smoke from a nearby brush fire and guided only by victims’ screams.
Others were dispatchers who ad-
vised frantic callers while trying to process what was happening on the other end of the line.
“It’s one thing to go on a call and 
respond to emergencies like a vehicle accident or a heart attack,” Bailey said. “But it is another to go to an incident where nature is working against you.”

To stay afloat, public radio stations often 
rely on the kindness of strangers.
WUFT-FM does it with wine.
UF’s 89.1 WUFT-FM will host its 23rd an-
nual “A Celebration of Wine” event from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday in the Reitz Union Grand Ball-room.
Sue Wagner, special events coordinator for 
WUFT-FM, said the event is an important fund-raiser for the station.
“We’ve raised over $300,000 for the life of 
the event,” she said. “It’s also provided aware-ness to the community.”
Wagner said the fundraising event was 
started to help benefit the public radio station.
Last year, the event raised $36,667 for the 
station.
Donors provide more than 1,000 types of 
wine for attendees to bid on or sample, said Kathy Bare, senior accountant for the multi-media department of the College of Journalism and Communications.
Attendees can also bid in the silent auction 
for prizes including wine, jewelry, pottery and art, all of which are donated for the event.Tickets cost $55 in advance and $60 at the 
door. Tickets are available online at wuft.org/wine.
WUFT-FM 89.1 airs 24 hours a day in 19 
counties in North Central and mid-Florida.
Unlike commercial radio, public radio re-
lies on fundraisers, pledge drives and special events to raise money.
Bare, a supporter of public radio, said she 
has attended about a dozen “A Celebration of Wine” fundraisers.
She said the event is important because oth-
er funding for the station has decreased with the economic downturn.
Although WUFT-FM  has some staunch 
supporters and the fundraisers have been suc-cessful, Bare said,  she still has one wish.

� ‘HOTDOGGERS’ SERVE AS BRAND 
AMBASSADORS ACROSS COUNTRY.
JAVIER EDWARDS
Alligator Contributing Writer
UF seniors will have one more oppor -
tunity this year to become Oscar Mayer 
“Hotdoggers” and travel the country in a 27-foot-long hot dog.
Two Oscar Mayer brand ambassadors, 
or Hotdoggers, will host an information session at 5:30 p.m. on Thursday in the Ca-reer Resource Center conference room.
The location may change. If it does, fli-
ers naming the new location will be posted in the Career Resource Center.
All majors are welcome, but only se-
niors may apply for the position.
Hotdoggers represent Oscar Mayer 
by traveling through the U.S. 365 days a year hosting festivals, parades and charity events.
The application deadline for the elec-
tronic application was Feb. 1, but UF se-niors who missed it can submit their ap-plications and schedule an interview for Friday, said Hotdogger Traci Johnson, aka Tailgatin’ Traci.
Johnson said students submitting ap-plications should bring a resume and cov-er letter. 
Students who only want to find out more about the job are also welcome to at-tend the session.
“The reason we’re on this campus is because we know that this is an awesome college,” Johnson said. “We have had many Hotdoggers in the past who have gone to University of Florida, so we know that there are great candidates on campus, and we’re hoping that they will come out and apply.”
Competition to become a Hotdogger is 
steep. 
Only 12 candidates across the country 
are selected each year.
Johnson, a recent graduate from the 
University of Wisconsin, said the experi-ence she is gaining from being a Hotdog-ger is invaluable.
“It has opened up a lot of doors for 
me in the job market already,” she said. “Even though I graduated with a degree in journalism, I am now completely me-dia-trained.”
Hotdogger “Beefy” Brian Keefe said 
students should bring personality and big smiles if they are looking to land an in-terview. It doesn’t matter what major you are, he said, as long as you have a bubbly personality and enjoy interacting with people.
“This is huge for your resume,” Keefe 
said. “You’re looking at a chance to drive around in one of the world’s most iconic vehicles.” WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 9

Gainesville’s mayor is working 
to promote the president and keep 
Republicans in check.
Mayor Craig Lowe announced 
Tuesday he joined the Obama For America “Truth Team,” a group formed to remind voters of the presi-dent’s achievements during his term and hold presidential opponents ac-countable.
The group will spread Presi-
dent Obama’s campaign message through speeches, campaigns and rallies. Groups will fact-check op-ponents’ statements and post the results on several websites.
The team has set up attackwatch.
com and keepinggophonest.com. Both will work to correct Republi-can candidates if they make false 
claims about the 
president or his campaign.
AttackWatch 
was formed so viewers can “get the facts you need to fight back against false at-
tacks on the president and his re-cord,” according to the website.
KeepingGOPHonest researches 
the Republican candidates and their stances on issues, including equal rights, the economy and health re-form.
The group’s third website, keep-
inghisword.com, was created to show initiatives Obama has passed while in office.
Lowe said he will tour North Florida to promote Obama’s accom-plishments. He said he could have the most impact on that area since it is his home.
Lowe said he joined the group 
because he believes in the presi-dent’s message and believes he has been successful while in office.
“I will be pointing out the truth,” 
Lowe said. “And the truth is that this president should be re-elected.”

A grassroots organization will final-
ly see the fruits of its labor in the form 
of a renovated community center.
On Monday, renovations began at 
the Southwest Gainesville Advocacy Group Resource Center, a community center that has been in the works for two years.
The 3,100-square-foot center will 
serve as a meeting place for families and an after-school facility for children and teenagers. The center will open its doors in mid-April.
The Alachua County Commission 
gave the group $225,000 to purchase two buildings, one of which will serve as the resource center, Commissioner Susan Baird said. The group hopes to turn the second building into a public health clinic, but it needs more fund-ing.
Visitors use learning materials, 
family planning resources and health services, among other resources. The site will have a playground, a meeting room, two play areas and a kitchen, said Dorothy Benson, chairwoman of the Southwest Gainesville Advocacy Group.
Southwest Gainesville, between 
Tower Road and Interstate 75, had one of the highest densities of crime in Ala-
chua County in 2009, according to data compiled by the Ala-chua County Sheriff’s Office.
When residents 
who lived along Tower Road learned about this data, they formed the group to 
help strengthen and empower families in the area, Benson said.
“I remember hearing mothers in the 
area talk about how they didn’t want their children to play outside because it was unsafe,” Benson said. “That’s unacceptable.”12, ALLIGATOR §  WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 2012

Gainesville Police arrested a drug deal-
er and a buyer Monday for stealing about  
$3,200 in electronics from local Walmarts in the past two weeks.
Charlie V . Davis, 36, and Derrell T. 
Hagans, 33, were each charged with three counts of grand theft and three counts of dealing in stolen property. They lifted six e-readers, two netbooks and three cellphones, according to GPD.
Hagans wanted to buy crack cocaine from 
Davis, but he did not have enough money. He planned to trade the stolen electronics with Davis, who told police he only served as a lookout.
Around 8 a.m. on Jan. 26, Davis and 
Hagans entered the Walmart Supercenter off Waldo Road, opened an unlocked glass display and stuffed six Kindles under their clothes.  
When security guards noticed the missing 
merchandise, they watched the security tape and saw Davis and Hagans steal the e-read-ers, which cost $1,049 altogether, according to police.
The same security guards got a chance to 
see the thieves in person that day. Davis and Hagans appeared at Walmart again at about 7:30 a.m. Monday. The guards detained them before calling the police. Davis and Hagans remained at Alachua County Jail on Tuesday evening, held on bails of $30,000 and $40,000 respectively.
Between trips to the Supercenter off Wal-
do Road, Davis and Hagans hit the Walmart at 2649 NW 13th St. twice, according to po-lice.
The first time, on Feb. 7, the men stole two 
HP Pavilion netbooks. Davis put one in his backpack, and Hagans put one in a pants pocket.
Davis said he drove Hagans to the Wal-
mart Supercenter on Jan. 26 but didn’t steal any of the Kindles. Hagans told investigators he and Davis each stole three e-readers.
After they left the store, Davis said, Hagans 
gave him a pair of Kindles in exchange for $100 worth of crack cocaine. The pair made similar trades after the other two burglaries, in which Davis received a netbook, a cell-phone and $40.  
Hagans told investigators he sold all of the 
Kindles for $50-$100 each, and the other net-book sold for $150.

For the Saucermans, every day is Valen-
tine’s Day.
Alvera Saucerman, 79, and Jim Saucer -
man, 80, spent Tuesday at the Valentine’s 
Day Sweetheart Dance at the Senior Recre-ation Center. Going to dances isn’t unusual for the couple, who have been married for 60 years and met each other in elementary school.
They go to every dance hosted by the 
Swing and Sway Dance Club, which orga-nized Tuesday’s dance, Alvera said.
When the couple met, Jim was in third 
grade. Alvera was in second.
“You tell the story of how we met,” Al-
vera said to her husband. “You’re better at it.”
The first time he saw her was at school. 
He immediately ran to find his aunt who worked there to tell her he had a new girl-friend, he said.
They became friends, started dating be-
fore high school and were married. She was 19, and he was 20.
“We’re just really grateful to be together 
and in good health,” she said.
Usually they’re on the dance floor the whole time, she said, but Alvera’s feet were hurting. After two dances, the couple walked out of the dance room and sat on a sofa together.
Both worked in education their entire 
lives, so they were never rich. But they said that didn’t stop them from pursuing their mutual passion for travel.
Ten years ago, the Saucermans went bun-
gee jumping in Queenstown, New Zealand.
He held her hand, and they laughed as 
they recalled their bungee jumping adven-ture.
“I thought they wouldn’t let us do it be-
cause of our age,” she said. “I was getting ready to protest, but then the woman said, ‘Boy, do I have a deal for you.’”
Back on the dance floor, laughter filled 
the room as some of the men spun their la-dies around to Frank Sinatra songs.
“The neatest thing about it is that people 
in wheelchairs and walkers throw them away and dance,” said Otto Johnson, presi-dent of the Swing and Sway Dance Club.Senior Center swing dancers

Florida center Patric Young led all scorers with 19 points in UF’s 61-52 win 
against Alabama on Tuesday. He said his ankle injury is still not 100 percent.
GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
 
At halftime of Tuesday’s matchup with Ala-
bama, Florida looked like it might not be able to 
break free of its funk. 
UF was mired in a 26-26 tie after shooting just 
30.8 percent over a sloppy first 20 minutes, and a third consecutive loss looked like a distinct pos-sibility. 
But, once the buzzer sounded to start the sec-
ond half, the Gators took off. 
No. 14 Florida (20-6, 8-3 Southeastern Confer -
ence) opened the final 20 minutes on a 16-0 run, pulling away from Alabama (16-9, 5-6 SEC) en route to a 61-52 win Tuesday night in Tuscaloosa, Ala.
Patric Young played a key role in the spurt, 
scoring eight of his game-high 19 points on three dunks and a layup. 
“I told him after the game this is a by-product 
of how hard he has worked the last two days in practice,” coach Billy Donovan said. “He has been phenomenal. Just his effort, his energy, pushing through things. He really gave us a huge lift.”
Young and fellow frontcourt starters Brad Beal 
and Erik Murphy combined for 47 of the Gators’ 61 points by exploiting favorable matchups against a depleted Alabama frontline. 
The Crimson Tide was without JaMychal 
Green and Tony Mitchell — the team’s top two scorers and rebounders — after both received in-definite suspensions Saturday. 
Despite a foot injury, Young connected on 9 of 
12 shots while playing just 22 minutes due to foul trouble. 
“I’m not completely at 100 percent, but I’d say [Tuesday] was the best I’ve felt in a while,” Young said. 
Murphy and Beal each added 14 points, with 
Murphy hitting 4 of 8 shots from beyond the arc. 
The duo also made an impact on the defensive 
end, where Beal had two steals and two blocks while Murphy had four steals and one block. 
Those efforts were just part of a dominating 
UF defense that helped spark the second-half run by switching to a suffocating zone. 
Florida held Alabama without a field goal for 
the half’s first 9:06. 
The Crimson Tide entered the contest 342nd  
in the nation in 3-point shooting at 27.3 percent, and those struggles continued Tuesday.  Alabama was never able to shoot Florida out of the zone, hitting only 4 of 16 shots from beyond the arc.
The Gators also forced 18 turnovers, a num-
ber that matched Alabama’s total of made field goals. Florida converted those takeaways into 24 points. 
“The zone in the second half helped us,” Don-
ovan said. “The zone was effective for us defen-sively.”
Although the focus was on the frontcourt, 
point guard Erving Walker became Florida’s all-time assist leader in the win. His seven assists brought his career total to 505, passing Ronnie Montgomery’s mark of 503, which had stood since 1988. 
“It’s quite an accomplishment for him,” Dono-
van said. “For a guy 5-foot-8, he’s had a heck of a career.”
Walker and Kenny Boynton struggled to find 
their offense in the game, hitting a combined 3 of 14 shots, including 1 of 10 from beyond the arc. 
It was also a poor offensive night for Florida’s 
bench, which failed to register a point as Will Yeguete and Mike Rosario sat out with injuries. 
Thankfully for the Gators, Young and the rest 
of the frontcourt were there to pick up the slack and put an end to Florida’s two-game slide.
“I was proud of our guys’ resiliency,” Donovan 
said. “I think the adversity that we went through, I’m really hoping that it can make us better.”

The Gators only have two games left to play in the O’Connell Center. March, the month syn-
onymous with the NCAA Tourna-ment, is two weeks away . 
Time is running out on this sea-
son, but that hasn’t stopped coach Billy Donovan’s search for tougher, more resilient basketball players.
“I’m not pleased,” Donovan said 
Saturday after Tennessee finished a season sweep of UF. “These guys are great guys, but we haven’t been hardened enough. …We need to practice better. We need to be more on edge. We need to take everything to a different level.”
After being pushed around and 
outplayed in a pair of losses last week, Donovan reflected during his postgame press conference on a time he barely had to look for a mentally strong and focused team. 
He invoked the names of past 
Gators, winners of multiple national championships.   
“Joakim Noah, Al Horford and 
those guys weren’t hardened, ei-ther,” Donovan said. “But there is a mentality and an understanding of what really goes into a preparation to really go out there and win.”
Donovan said his current crop of 
players need to experience the ad-versity of mounting injuries or the indignity of blowout losses.
 “There are certain teams that you 
sit there and you look back and say , ‘You know w h a t ? They had to kind of go through it,’” he said.
If so, 
D o n o v a n s h o u l d have seen 
a change months ago. The Gators have been through their fair share of adversity already . 
Before conference play began, 
tight road losses at Ohio State and Syracuse should have shown them how national championship-caliber teams crash the boards and create turnovers. At Rutgers, the Gators learned the pain of an overtime loss.
Injuries to forward Erik Murphy 
and Patric Young forced Florida to play eight games without its regular starting five.
The only hardship seemingly left 
for the Gators to experience occurred when forward Will Yeguete — UF’s leader in steals and rebounding per -
centage, according to Kenpom.com — suffered his second concussion of the season against the V olunteers. 
“You can play really , really hard 
and really, really well and be under -
manned and still fall short, and you walk off the court disappointed and upset, figuring out where you can get better,” Donovan said.
As UF’s primary energy player off the bench, Yeguete was sorely missed in the five-point loss and again in a win Tuesday at Alabama. 
At 6-foot-7, he’s undersized and 
not much of a shot blocker, but he’s also the key to the Gators’ press and a magician at engineering steals.
Without him in the lineup, UF is 
missing its one player who fits Don-ovan’s  “hardened” billing. A void has been created for someone like Murphy , Young, Casey Prather or Scottie Wilbekin to match Yeguete’s impact down the stretch.  
But with just five games left in 
the regular season, the window is closing fast.

Amanda O’Leary doesn’t mind going 
with the hot hand.
As No. 3 Florida prepares to take on 
Jacksonville tonight at 6:30 p.m. at Donald 
R. Dizney Stadium, the Gators’ coach has something she did not have last season: two viable starting options in net.
As a freshman, Cara Canington started 
every game for Florida, while fellow fresh-man Mikey Meagher saw just more than 83 minutes of action. Last season, Meagher took control of the starting job for the en-tirety of the season after Canington suffered a broken finger on her right hand during the fall.
Canington said that over the course of 
the last year, her finger healed and it has al-lowed her to perform at a higher level than prior to the 2011 season.
“Mentally and physically, an injury is al-
ways tough to come back from,” Canington said. “This year, being 100 percent now and coming back, it feels good and I’m ready to go.”
It was evident to O’Leary from the start 
of fall practice that Canington was eager to earn more playing time her junior season.
“She definitely has come out with more 
of a fire in her that she didn’t want to settle for being that backup,” O’Leary said.
Canington said she focused on improv-
ing her hand speed in the offseason by jug-gling and throwing the ball against a wall repeatedly and catching it.
Meagher has played the first half in both the Gators exhibition against England and regular-season opener, an 11-9 loss to North Carolina, while Canington was in net for the second half of each game.
Both goalkeepers allowed a goal against 
England, with Meagher saving four shots and Canington recording six saves.
In the UNC game, the Tar Heels scored 
four goals in the last eight minutes of the first half to take a 7-3 lead, and Meagher was replaced by Canington, who allowed four goals on five shots in the second half.
O’Leary said she was already planning 
on playing both goalkeepers, but added it is an advantage to have one who can step in when the other is having a sub-par day.
“It’s a benefit versus a hindrance,” 
O’Leary said. “To be able to look at whom-ever isn’t starting and know they can go in and perform eases a lot off of our minds.” 
While she has not started a game this 
season, Canington said which half she plays does not make a difference to her.
“You try to keep the same mental edge,” 
Canington said. “Whether you come in the first or second half.”
Meagher said her relationship with Can-
ington has made it an easy adjustment to go from getting the bulk of the workload last year to being in a constant battle for play-ing time.
“We’re friends on and off the field and we’re there to support each other for any-thing,” Meagher said. 
With both junior goalies completely 
healthy, O’Leary said she has no reserva-tions playing either at any time. Their per -
formance has been equal in practice and the starter will be determined on a game-by-game basis.
“Now we have two great options; two op-
tions I feel really comfortable with,” O’Leary said. “We’ll allow them to compete each and every day for that starting position.” WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 2012 § ALLIGATOR, 19

By Sunday night, the Gators’ mental stamina 
matched the recent Gainesville weather: below av-
erage.
After a long weekend, coach Tim Walton has to 
get his team back up to 100 percent for its home opener against Jacksonville today at 5 p.m.
Florida played five games in the USF-Fairfield 
Inn Tampa North Tournament last weekend, win-ning every one. However, playing back-to-back games on both Saturday and Sunday took its toll on Walton’s squad.
“I don’t know if I had them motivated and fo-
cused to be honest,” Walton said Sunday. “It was really cold and a long day. We were out here for al-most seven-and-a-half hours. [It] was really longer than it is probably supposed to be on the last game of the weekend.”
Sunday was an unusually long day for the 
Gators because the weather wasn’t very accommo-dating Friday night.
Florida was scheduled to face Long Island and 
Florida Gulf Coast on the first day of the tourna-ment. However, umpires halted play in the fifth inning of the first game against Long Island due to incessant rain. 
The Gators, who were just one run and one 
half-inning shy of closing out their first victory of the season, had to return to the stadium Saturday morning to finally win 8-0 against the Blackbirds. With a double-header scheduled Saturday evening, Florida had to re-schedule its matchup with FGCU for Sunday. 
“With the rain the other night, and three games 
(Saturday), I think we were not so much fatigued  but a little mentally exhausted,” Walton said.
Heading into Sunday already worn from a long 
weekend, the Gators faced their toughest test of the tournament at USF. 
After Florida mercy ruled its first three oppo-
nents, it needed eight innings and two pitchers just to squeak out a 3-2 victory against the Bulls.
Sophomore Hannah Rogers came in for fresh-
man Lauren Haeger in the sixth inning, knowing she would return to the circle soon after to face the Eagles. But Rogers wasn’t too worried about the physical aspect of pitching nine-plus innings in one day.
“My arm never really gets tired,” Rogers said. 
“My legs get tired sometimes, but we have a really good trainer and he makes sure that we’re always 
heating or icing or stretching our arms. That’s probably why I don’t 
have too many arm problems.”
However, Rogers could not 
shrug off the difficulty of getting mentally prepared for the last game after just having pitched and weathered the dipping tem-peratures. She said she had to motivate herself to go out and 
convince herself it was like pitching in any other game.
This Wednesday, the Gators will play host to 
the Dolphins on two days rest. Haeger, who start-ed two of Florida’s first five games in the circle, has already felt the impact of the long weekend but said she looks to become accustomed to the hectic schedule as the year progresses.
“It was tiring,” Haeger said. “Five games is a lot of games, but it doesn’t 
compare to what we’re going to get into. It was a long first weekend for all of us. Making it to Sun-day was definitely a little bit of an adjustment, but I think it will get better.”UF pushing through mental fatigue

� HE IS BATTLING KISH, GIBSON 
AND MAGLIOZZI FOR THE SPOT. 
TOM GREEN
Alligator Staff Writer
 
Jonathon Crawford is ready to be a 
starting pitcher again.
After seldom being used out of the 
bullpen as a freshman, Crawford, a start-
ing pitcher before signing with Florida, feels he has matured enough to take the next step and contribute in a role No. 1 UF needs to fill entering the season: the midweek starter.
The only problem is the three fellow 
underclassmen standing in his way.
With the season set to begin Fri-
day, Crawford and fellow sophomores Keenan Kish, a righty, and Daniel Gib-son, a southpaw, along with freshman right-hander Johnny Magliozzi are all vying for the Gators’ midweek job. “It’s really tight — you’ve got Johnny 
and us three sophomores,” Crawford said. “It’s really up for grabs for any-body.”
Although the competition is open, 
Crawford and Magliozzi appear to have the edge as the season approaches. Each tossed at least three innings in Florida’s intrasquad scrimmage at McKethan Stadium on Sunday , and each made his case for the starting job.
Crawford pitched the first three 
frames of the afternoon and surrendered three runs on three hits while striking out four and allowing four other batters to reach base. 
Magliozzi tossed 3.1 innings and 
allowed three runs on five hits as he struck out one and walked two.
While both labored at times, the un-
derclassmen showed flashes of what they can bring to the midweek rotation for a Florida team that went 7-7 in reg-ular-season midweek games and saw its starting pitchers go just 6-4 in those matchups.
At one point Sunday , Crawford 
struck out junior catcher Mike Zunino, making the reigning Southeastern Con-ference Player of the Year whiff at a pitch below his knees.
Zunino walked back toward the 
dugout and looked up at Crawford while shaking his head with a smirk of disbelief.
“Just throw that for a strike every 
time,” Zunino said. “That was like 84 (mph) breaking two feet.”
The outing showed progress for 
Crawford, who saw the fewest innings of any of the pitchers in Florida’s bull-pen last season. He appeared in just five games and pitched a total of 3.2 frames with a 4.91 ERA as a freshman. 
In the offseason, however, he worked 
on dropping his arm slot and now gets more late movement on his fastball and slider — and more confidence on the mound, too.
“I’ve made a huge improvement 
from last year,” Crawford said. “This year, I throw a lot more strikes and don’t walk people.”
While Crawford has adjusted his 
mechanics and feels more comfortable on the mound, teammates have been impressed with Magliozzi in the short time the 20-year-old freshman has been on campus, and not just because of his reliable changeup and low-90s fastball.
Hudson Randall, who will take the 
mound for Florida’s season opener Fri-day , said he has really been impressed by Magliozzi’s maturity on the rubber.
However, coach Kevin O’Sullivan 
hasn’t tipped his hand just yet as to which underclassman will take on the role, saying the team needs to nail down that position, as well as the middle relief slots.
“They’re competitive,” left-handed 
pitcher Brian Johnson said. “They all know that there are spots open and hav-ing a spot doesn’t mean you’re guaran-teed that spot every day.”

Junior Mia Piccio started the second day of the 
Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge on Tues-
day tied for 11th, and after she parred her first five holes, she moved up to sixth. 
Piccio’s round then took a turn. She finished the 
round with seven bogeys, a double bogey and one birdie for a 79 (+8) which caused her to jump from sixth to 35th. 
Evan Jensen, a senior who entered the tourna-
ment as Florida’s No. 4 player, currently leads the Gators after she carded a 75 (+4). 
Although this wasn’t the greatest round for 
Jensen, the 72 (+1) she shot on Monday helps bal-ance it out. She is currently tied for 14th.
Although Piccio and Jensen scored higher Tues-
day than they did on Monday, freshman Camilla Hedberg had a better performance in the second round. Her five-bogey, four-birdie round of 72 (+1) 
pushed her up 16 spots from tied for 35th to tied for 19th. 
“Evan and Camilla really 
grinded hard [Tuesday] and played solid golf,” coach Jan Dowling said
Despite Hedberg’s improve-
ment Tuesday, the team contin-ued to drop. The Gators went from tied for eighth to 12th by 
shooting a 308 (+24), six strokes more than Mon-day’s round. 
“It was a pretty frustrating day for us,” Dowl-
ing said. “But we have a fresh start tomorrow, and we’re capable of a lot better.”  
UCLA remains at the top of the leaderboard 
with a two day total of 570 (+2). This puts them 18 strokes ahead of second-place Southern Cal and 40 strokes ahead of Florida.
Andrea Watts and Isabelle Lendl both contin-
ued to have a hard time on the course shooting an 82 (+11) and an 89 (+18). 
Although finishing in the top 10 is not out of 
reach for Florida, Piccio, Jensen and Hedberg will be counting on Watts or Lendl to break 80 in the final round.  Piccio falters as 
Gators continue 
to struggle WOMEN’S GOLF Crawford in running for midweek role
“It’s really up for grabs for 
anybody.”
