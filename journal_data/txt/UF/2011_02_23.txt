Fight over Girl Scout cookies leads to arrest in Naples
NAPLES — A brawl between room-
mates over Girl Scout cookies led to as-
sault charges against one of them.
According to the Naples Daily News, 
the Collier County Sheriff’s Office reports that 31-year-old Hersha Howard woke up her roommate early Sunday and ac-cused her of eating her Thin Mints.
They argued and deputies say it 
turned physical with Howard chasing her roommate with scissors and hitting her repeatedly with a board and then a sign.
Police say the roommate’s husband 
tried to separate them. 
The roommate said she gave the cook-
ies to Howard’s children.
Howard is charged with aggravated 
battery with a deadly weapon and aggra-vated assault with a deadly weapon. She was released Monday on $10,000 bail.

UF ACADEMICS

UF students may be dropping serious 
dollars on tuition hikes, but they’re getting 
the third-best bang for their buck in the 
country.
The Princeton Review ranked UF third 
among public universities on its Best Value Colleges for 2011 list, which included 100 
schools. 
It’s the first time UF has cracked the top 
10 according to UF spokesman Steve Or -
lando. 
The top 100 schools on the list include 
50 private and 50 public universities, with 
the University of Virginia taking the top spot for public colleges and Swarthmore College ranking number one among the private ones.
The list was compiled based on schools’ 
cost of attendance, financial aid and aca-demics.
Thomas Goldkamp, a UF senior, came 
to the school partly because of the financial aid he was offered.
“I’m from New Orleans, so when I came 
from out of state it was a big deal for me because they gave me a good scholarship,” he said.
He wasn’t surprised the school made the 
list but was surprised it was ranked so high given the financial aid cuts students have UF named third-best 
value for public schoolsThe Princeton Review “Top 10 Best Value Public Colleges for 2011”

One day of voting down and 
one more day of fliers, stickers 
and the million-dollar question, “Have you voted?”
In the first day of Student Gov-
ernment elections, 5,532 students did vote on Tuesday, according to 
Supervisor of Elections Amanda 
Griffin.
On the first day of elections last 
spring, 5,289 students voted. 
This semester’s ballot includes 
the executive and Student Senate candidates along with a referen-dum question about whether or 
not block tuition should be imple-mented at UF. 
If implemented, block tuition 
would charge students a flat-rate 
tuition for 15 credit hours, no mat-
ter how many they are actually taking.
James Burns was one of the 
voters with block tuition in mind. The senior criminology major said the major reason he voted was 
because he thinks block tuition is 
wrong.
He said even though he is 
graduating, he doesn’t think it’s 
fair that any student should have to pay for 15 credit hours. 
Both the Unite Party and Prog-
ress Party are against block tu-
ition.
Cecelia Hardwick, spokes-
woman for the Unite Party, said 
that the first day seemed to have 
a huge turnout. 
She said she thought the ques-
tion of block tuition really helped bring students out. 
“Everyone is really excited and 
we’re aiming to talk to as many people as possible,” she said. 
“We want students to understand 
what we’re about and what we’ve 
accomplished in the past.”
On Tuesday, Phoebe Evans 
voted 
in her first  
Stu-
dent Body election.
The first-year health-science 
major said the issue that brought 
her to the polls was online voting. 
“You can only vote at certain 
places,” she said. “And it’s unfair to those off campus.”
She said from what she under -
stood, the Progress Party wants to implement it.
Progress Party representatives 
were not available for comment.Voter turnout up on first day of SG election

Medics attend to journalism major Natasha Schoultz after she was struck by a bus when crowds of people dis -

As the world’s population 
grows daily so does the world’s de-
mand for food, a World Food Prize laureate said during a presentation Tuesday. 
Gebisa Ejeta, a distinguished 
professor of plant breeding and genetics and international agricul-tural at Purdue University, spoke to a crowd of about 200 at Emerson Alumni Hall. 
Born and raised in a small Ethio-
pian village, Ejeta, who was intro-duced as a “rock star of agricul-ture,” said he believes that in order to bring about world peace, world hunger must be addressed. 
Ejeta split his presentation into 
two parts. The first covered the is-sues facing society regarding food production. 
The second focused on the chal-
lenges facing developing countries such as those on the African conti-nent. 
Throughout both parts, Ejeta 
emphasized the overlying issue of poverty.Among those in attendance at 
Tuesday’s presentation was UF President Bernie Machen. 
The challenges Ejeta discussed 
included a growing population, de-forestation, climate change, water shortages and a lack of agricultural education. Ejeta said he believes technology is part of the answer to meeting the world’s projected dou-bling demand of food.
Another part of the answer, he 
said, lies in education. 
He said that while developing 
countries have seen a rise in school 
attendance, he worries that the qual-ity of their 
education may not be sufficient. Ejeta said he wants to focus on net-working young African scientists and mentors who can inspire them. 
While the list of challenges fac-
ing the agricultural industry is daunting and appears to be some-what overwhelming, Ejeta remains hopeful.
“We can still rise up to the chal-
lenges and face them head on,” he said.Food expert discusses challenges of world food supply

A UF student was taken to Shands at UF on Tuesday 
morning after she was hit by a Regional Transit System 
bus on West University Avenue, having suffered non-
life-threatening injuries.
Natasha Schoultz, a 21-year-old journalism junior, 
was standing on  the south side of the curb in front of 
the Florida Theatre, 233 W. University Ave., and stepped 
off the curb into the street, Gainesville Police Department spokeswoman Tscharna Senn said.
At that moment, an RTS bus was heading east going 
about 30 miles per hour. It was unable to stop in time, hitting Schoultz.
Police and traffic homicide investigators arrived at 
about 1:53 a.m. Schoultz, who suffered some serious in-
juries to her face, was taken to Shands at UF for medical 
evaluation.
Doctors determined that Schoultz’s injuries weren’t 
life-threatening, though she was still in the hospital as 
of press time.UF student hit by bus downtown

Borders will close its Gainesville store be-
cause the company filed for Chapter 11 bank-
ruptcy reorganization Wednesday.
Twenty-six employees, many who are part-
time, work at the Gainesville store at 6837 
Newberry Road. They heard the bad news the 
same day the business announced its decision to close. 
Mary Davis, the company’s spokeswoman, 
said it will close before May 1. 
Nicole Vassallo, a 20-year-old UF sopho-
more, said she is disappointed the store is clos-ing because she studied there every week. 
“I’m sorry to see the store go,” she said. 
The store opened in November 1999 but was 
placed on Borders’ list of “underperforming 
stores” that must close to make 
the company profitable. 
Of the company’s 642 stores 
nationwide, 200 are closing due 
to lack of sales, Davis said.
The Gainesville store is currently selling 
books 20 to 40 percent off.
Davis said the company expects the dis-
counts to increase throughout the month until 
the store is closed. All sales will be final.
David Denslow, an economics professor  
at UF, said the increase of sales in electronic books on iPads and Nooks caused the store’s 
downfall.
He said people use the Internet to find infor -
mation about books, and now there is no need 
for in-store clerks.
Davis said the organization is currently 
looking for options for the employees who are losing their jobs.Borders to close

ACADEMICS
By MORGAN WATKINS
Alligator Writer
The GRE has been marked for 
death. 
The current test, which is the 
standard examination for admis -
sion into most graduate programs, 
will be replaced with a revised version Aug. 1, adding new ques-
tion types and an extra hour to the 
test’s length. 
The revised test will place 
heavier emphasis on higher rea-
soning skills. The test will also 
take about four hours to complete 
instead of the current three-hour 
length, said Lee Weiss, director of graduate programs for Kaplan Test Prep. 
The Verbal Reasoning section 
will emphasize reading compre-hension and higher-level thinking skills, while the Quantitative Rea-soning section will include more 
data analysis and real-life scenario 
questions. 
Some question types, such as 
analogies, will die with the current 
version of the test, but new ones 
will rise to take their place. The computer version of the 
new GRE will allow test-takers to 
edit or change answers and tag questions they want to return to later, according to the Educational 
Testing Service website. 
For students who balk at the 
idea of answering math questions 
by hand, the new test will also in-clude an on-screen calculator. 
“It’s more up to date and more 
relevant for business schools be-cause there’s more data analysis and the math questions are busi-ness-related,” said Syed Safdar Ka-
zmi, a finance senior at UF.
Kazmi said he may take the new 
GRE without taking the GMAT be-
cause it will better test the skills he will need in a graduate-level busi-
ness program than the current ver -
sion does.
“I can kill two birds with one 
stone [with the new GRE].” 
However, the new test comes 
with drawbacks. Those who take 
the new test in August will not 
receive their scores until mid-No-vember because the results can’t be calculated until enough people 
have taken the test, Weiss said. Those facing early fall deadlines 
won’t have GRE scores to include 
in their application unless they take it before Aug. 1.
Students who plan to apply to 
graduate or business school next 
year should sign up for the current 
GRE as soon as possible to guar -
antee a testing spot this summer, Weiss said.
Those applying with Janu-
ary deadlines may also not have enough time to retake the GRE for a higher score if they take the new test, he said. The new test can only 
be taken once every 60 days, com -
pared to the current GRE’s limit of 
one test session every 30 days or each calendar month. 
Those who plan to apply to 
graduate school in the next few 
years have a unique opportunity to 
choose which version of the GRE they want to take, he said. Those interested in taking the current ver -
sion can do so before August and 
can submit their scores to graduate 
schools for up to five years.
“It’s a great opportunity to de-
cide which is the better test for 
you,” Weiss said. GRE overhaul to place emphasis on reasoning skills

Despite those cuts, UF still ranks as one of the best pub-
lic college bargains in the U.S. with a price tag of $5,020 
in tuition and fees for in-state students, according to the university website. 
The College Board website lists the average annual 
cost of tuition and fees for in-state students at a public four-year university at $7,605.
“With the economy, I think parents are being much 
more conscious about what they’re paying [for college],” Orlando said. 
Orlando also said the quality of UF students, which 
has increased along with the competi-tiveness of the admissions process, was another factor in its high ranking from 
the Princeton Review. 
The top 100 list was based on data that included stu-
dent surveys taken from fall 2009 to fall 2010, as well as 
fall 2010 surveys about school costs and financial aid, ac-cording to the Princeton Review website.
The top 10 in the public and private college categories 
were ranked, but the remaining schools were published in alphabetical order without rankings.
The Princeton Review isn’t the only company recog-
nizing UF as a good bargain for students. 
The Kiplinger’s Personal Finance magazine ranked UF 
second behind the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on its 2011 list of the 100 best values in public col-leges.

TAMPA — Grammy-winning reggae singer Buju 
Banton was convicted Tuesday of conspiring to set up 
a cocaine deal in 2009, a verdict that elicited anguish and disbelief among supporters in a crowded court-
room and from other artists in his native Jamaica.
A federal jury deliberated for 11 hours over two 
days on the fate of Banton, who won a Grammy last 
week for best reggae album for his work entitled 
“Before the Dawn.” He was found guilty of three of 
four charges, and his attorney said he’s facing at least 15 years in prison.
The 37-year-old Banton, whose given name is 
Mark Myrie, remains wildly popular in Jamaica, 
and the trial — his second over the drug accusations 
— was packed with supporters that included other well-known reggae artists. The first trial ended in a mistrial last year after the jury deadlocked.
The tall, dreadlocked singer didn’t react when a 
clerk read the verdict on Tuesday. He stood, hugged his attorneys, then turned around and blew kisses to his supporters in the courtroom and told them: “Thank you.” A woman yelled out “We love you, Buju!” as U.S. marshals led him away.
“Obviously we are all upset and disappointed and 
emotional,” said Banton’s attorney, David Markus of Miami. “The only person who seems to be OK is Buju. He told us he was happy that he fought, know-
ing he was innocent.”
Markus said he plans to appeal the conviction and 
will file a motion to try to get Banton out of jail on 
bond in the meantime.
Banton was found guilty of conspiracy to possess 
with the intent to distribute cocaine, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense and using a telephone to facilitate a drug trafficking offense. He was acquitted of attempted possession 
with the intent to distribute cocaine.
No date has been set for his sentencing.
Assistant U.S. Attorney James Preston argued during trial that Banton portrayed himself as a bro-ker of drug deals in several conversations with a con-fidential informant. Preston said Banton thought he was getting involved in a “no-risk” deal in which he would introduce a friend to a confidential informant, 
and then later collect money from drug transactions.
Prosecutors acknowledge that Banton did not put 
any money into the drug deal, nor did he ever profit 
from it. Markus said his client is “a big talker” who 
admitted to trying to impress the confidential infor -
mant but wasn’t involved in any drug deal.
Much of the case hinged on meetings and phone 
calls that were video- and audiotaped by the infor -
mant, who was working with the Drug Enforcement 
Administration — and who made $50,000 in com-
mission after the bust.
In one video, Banton could be seen tasting cocaine 
in a Sarasota warehouse on Dec. 8, 2009 — but he 
was not present during the actual drug deal on Dec. 
10 that led two others to be arrest-
ed. Those two men later pleaded 
guilty.
Banton testified that that the in-
formant badgered him after they 
met on a trans-Atlantic flight in July 
2009 and insisted that they meet to 
set up a cocaine purchase. He said he was so uninterested in the in-formant’s proposals that after they 
met twice, Banton didn’t return the man’s phone calls for months.
In Banton’s native Jamaica, radio stations played 
his songs nonstop Tuesday, especially “Untold Sto-
ries” and “Not an Easy Road.”
Rapper Tony Rebel, a close friend who recorded 
with Banton, called it a sad day for young people 
who looked up to him.
The verdict marks “the saddest day for reggae and 
dancehall,” rapper Michael “Power Man” Davy said, adding he was “sad as a Rastaman and a Jamaican.”
Singer Junior Reid called it a conspiracy against 
reggae artists.
“With Buju gone, a big piece of reggae get chop 
off,” he said.Reggae singer Buju Banton

again railed against Michelle Obama’s national anti-obe-sity campaign on Monday, 
this time with an insult 
about the First Lady’s figure. Sure, calling out hypocrites is the place of many a televi-sion and radio personality, 
but we’re confused about 
what he meant. He said she didn’t look like a swimsuit model. We can agree with 
that. She looks like a strong, 
healthy woman, and that’s something poor Rush can’t ogle at, unlike the women-turned-objects on many 
magazine covers.
We usually give decided 
eyerolls when confronted 
with over-the-top feminism, 
but we’ve noticed that time 
and again Michelle Obama has been examined for her fashion sense or other as-pects of her appearance 
while ignored for her other 
actions and roles. Much the same holds true for other fe-male public figures, even if 
they are acting in the role of 
mothers, politicians or other professionals. The media perpetuate this idea by im-plying that having the per -
fect shape (whatever that is) and being on the cutting edge of fashion are the best things a woman can do. This 
isn’t the 1960s.
The First Lady is ad-
dressing one of our most 
pertinent health issues. She’s trying to help. You 
can complain about it if you 
want, Rush, but what have you helped do for our na-tion’s health, other than 
raise blood pressure for fans 
and enemies alike?Raving Mad
Libyan leader’s crimes 
difficult to punish
Sorry, Bahrain. While your protestors have a righteous cause in overthrowing one of the few absolute mon-archies left in the world, you can’t beat crazy.
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi’s notorious brutality 
coupled with his recent pledge that he would “fight until the last man, the last woman, the last bullet” screams for news coverage.
You might remember seeing footage of the man ram-
bling in front of the U.N. months ago — Gaddafi’s speech was even used as comedy fodder on “The Daily Show” — but the steps he is willing to take and has already taken are no laughing matter. If the idea of deploying a country’s air 
force with orders to strike its own people sounds reason-
able to you, consider that the Colonel’s own U.N. delega-tion just asked that he be charged with genocide.
We have heard of progress in several other Arab na-
tions, but we’re skeptical Gaddafi would consider giving in as “easily” as the other leaders have. He sees himself as captain, and he’ll go down with the ship if the need presents itself.
Even knowing that, we’ve come to accept that there’s 
little our government can do to pressure Libya into becom-ing more democratic: We have relatively little aid going into the country. 
It’s too bad our hands are tied because, as we said be-
fore, we know it’s difficult to beat crazy, and those protes-tors are going to need all the help they can get against a man with such a twisted mind.
Feeling emotion from statistics is difficult
We have a strange way of looking at tragedy and 
what’s important. It is our nature to be uncon-cerned about issues that do not directly affect us. 
I don’t know which is worse – the people who display com-plete ignorance of how their actions today will change the 
future, clinging to antiquated views through a misguided 
notion that to “stick to your guns” is a virtue despite new evidence, or whiny, liberal types who only care about is-sues as long as the problem doesn’t reach their doorsteps.
This being said, there is a pool of collective awareness 
we all look at, contribute to and draw from. Due to our individuality, we reach different conclusions when consid-ering the same situations. Yet there is an accepted way to look at tragedy, and it baffles me.
On Sept. 11, 3,000 people died in one of the most hor -
rific attacks ever documented in American history. The collapse is so poignant because of how well and sacred it is kept in our collective conscience. I don’t know anyone who got used to seeing those desperate, suffocating people leap from the buildings and into the streets below as the towers burnt to the ground. The outrage over what hap-pened reverberated throughout the world, and you will be telling your grandchildren where you were the day it 
happened.
That same day, 1,200 people died from smoking-related 
health complications. About 137 of them were from sec-
ondhand smoke exposure. The day after that, the same thing happened. And the next day, it happened again.
It has happened every day since then, including today. 
This is the part where I break it down and tell you how many people each hour or minute die, but you’ve already heard rants like this before. It isn’t just about considering 
the amount of people that have died or feeling bad about 
the risks of smoking. It’s really about asking yourself why we aren’t as outraged at other forms of needless death as we are Sept. 11.
We aren’t because it is so difficult to feel these numbers in the same way we can feel the deaths of Sept. 11.
Look at prescription medica-
tion. If you want to talk about 
something worth being outraged over, look no further. 
None of us want other people treading on our personal 
choices, but there has to come a time when you realize more people die from prescription drug overdose than any other drug. Concaine and heroin don’t hold a candle to Grandma’s Percocet. According to the Centers for Disease Control, more than 33,000 people died in 2005 from drug overdose, and that number has continued to rise thanks to the abuse of prescription medication.
Once again, this is all about perspective. Seeing numbers 
on a page never seems to affect people all that much. They read it and think, “Oh, wow. That’s tragic,” and move on. Bertrand Russell once said, “The mark of a civilized man [or human] is the capacity to read a column of numbers and weep.” Bertrand, for the rest of us it helps to see, hear and feel those numbers in real life. Imagine you get up to-morrow and see the news. Turns out that five Boeing 757s crashed and killed everyone on board in one day. Imagine you woke up the next day and saw that it was happen-
ing again, and again every day. You would be freaked out. 
This author would be freaked out. Collectively, our focus would shift, immediately. The number of deaths is similar to the smoking statistic, so why are the deaths of the peo-ple on the plane – some of whom are smokers – so grave?
I understand that death from smoking is a slow process 
and a personal choice, and that death by slamming into the ground inside an airplane you can’t control happens a little quicker and is scarier. This column is not meant 
to condemn anyone for their personal choice. It is simply 
about awareness of how we all choose how we look at ev-erything.

Fruits and vegetables are a great way to get the most 
nutrition out of your calories. They are packed with vitamins, 
minerals, ﬁ  ber and other nutrients, but adding in ﬁ  ve or more servings per day as recommended can seem daunting.
Following are some easy ways to add more fruits and 
vegetables to your diet:• Fill your fridge with cleaned, sliced and ready-to-eat raw vegetables and fruits.• Add fresh, frozen or dried fruit to your morning oatmeal, yogurt or whole-grain cereal. Too busy to do anything but run? Grab a piece of fruit before leaving home.• Make a smoothie with fresh or frozen fruit and yogurt, and freeze the leftovers for a refreshing snack.• “Sandwich” in sliced pineapple, apple, pepper, cucumber and more to sandwiches for unique and delicious creations.• Opt for a veggie pizza next time, and load up on toppings like broccoli, spinach, green peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms and zucchini.
You’ll be well on your way to the recommended ﬁ  ve or 
more servings if you serve a cup or more at each meal. (Two servings are equal to one cup, or a portion about the size of your ﬁ  st.) Pick up the freshest fruits and vegetables, as well as other items, from local growers and producers at farm-ers’ markets (ﬁ  nd locations at www.ﬂ  orida-agriculture.com/consumers/farmers_markets.htm) or “U-Pick” farms (ﬁ  nd locations at http://pickyourown.org/FLnorth.htm).
Expect an energy boost when you add more fruits and 
vegetables to your diet. Additionally, nutrients found in fresh 
produce can help prevent heart disease and some cancers, as well as promote healthy vi-sion, memory function and immunity. And choosing a banana instead of a brownie has great waist-slimming potential, too.
Add a few more fruits and vegetables to 
your diet each day for a more energetic and healthier you, and consider making an appointment with a registered di-etitian at the UF Student Health Care Center to create your own personal nutrition goals.

YOU TRACK YOUR PROGRESS.
You may have made a New Year’s resolu-
tion to work out more, but by the end of Febru-
ary most of those resolutions have begun to fade away like the winter weather in Florida.
A great way to get back on that horse is to 
start an exercise journal, which enables you to easily track your progress and see just how much you’ve improved over time.
Following are ﬁ  ve tips on starting your own 
exercise journal:
1. Decide how you want to journal. You can 
buy a traditional paper journal or use an online journal or app for your smartphone. Try www.onlineﬁ  tnesslog.com or check out the “Body Fit-ness” app for iPhone—both are free!2. Set aside time to journal. Find the time of day and environment that works best for you so you’ll stick to it.3. Consider making short-term goals, such as exercising three times in one week.4. Track your weekly activities. Give yourself credit for being active throughout the week, and remember that things like walking the dog and cleaning the house count, too!
Speciﬁ  c items to track regarding your exer-
cise: 
a) How am I feeling? (energy level, muscle/
joint pain and mood)
b) What did I do? (time, distance and/or 
reps)
c) How have I progressed? (faster, further 
and/or other successes).5. Allow yourself to just write! Write about your feelings and thoughts however they come out.
Be patient with yourself. It may take time 
to get comfortable with the idea of journaling if you’ve never done it before, so don’t worry if you miss a day or two. Just pick up your pen and start writing again when you can.
Reread your entries every month or so. Be 
objective and take the opportunity to see what areas you can improve, but also look back and celebrate the progress you have made!

Take a moment and forget about the upcoming exams, 
quizzes and projects. Try not to think about grades, profes-
sors and future plans. Relax.
Meditation and mantras are great for students about to 
enter the unofficial midterm weeks, when mental and physi-cal health takes a backseat.
“We can certainly see more academic concerns and 
anxiety about grades during these times, especially after the break when grades come back,” said Dr. Alvin Lawrence, a psychologist at the Counseling and Wellness Center. 
Unlike final exams, there is currently no leeway in office 
hours for a counselor or extended hours at the gym or library for midterms. Programs available for finals stress relief do not run during the middle of the semester.
Yet students still have many of the same concerns final 
exam week brings and resort to many of the same strate-gies they use without the help of the extra resources. 
Lawrence said lack of sleep, irregular eating schedules 
and a shift in extracurricular activities diminish health and add to the building stress.He also said stress can manifest physically: headaches, 
muscle tension, fatigue and difficulty sleeping. 
“One of the first things I ask when students come in is 
their caffeine intake,” Lawrence said. “If students don’t make the connection that the jitters and anxiety may be due to caffeine-use, it can feel like stress.”
While others may turn to coffee and caffeinated soda, 
Gray tries to stick to natural energy sources.
“I just try to sleep as much as possible,” she said. “When 
I’m feeling worn out, I make sure to eat some protein followed by strawberries dipped in melted chocolate as a treat.”
Andrew Burger, a UF freshman, keeps busy with 18 
credits and work. He rarely finds enough time to sleep. 
“I sleep whenever I can, but it’s never consistent,” he 
said. “Mountain Dew is my energy source. It keeps me up.” 
Students have to be careful with unnatural stimulants. 
They can help, but after a certain point, they can decrease productivity, Lawrence said. 
He said learning to naturally cope with stress and get-
ting enough sleep is key during the most stressful times. He suggested the life skills classes at the counseling center or playing a sport, whatever works for the student.Meditation combats stress of midterm exams

Spring break means that it’s time to store the 
hoodie and break out the bathing suit.
With less than two weeks left until UF’s spring 
break,  students are finding themselves preparing for a week of warm weather in more ways than one.
The weeks leading up to Spring Break are al-
ways a popular time for students to hit the gym, eat right and try to get back into beach shape so they can look their best while spending time out in the sun.
The Southwest Rec Center is the most frequent-
ed place by UF students looking to stay in shape.“In years past we have seen a spike in students 
visiting the gym during the couple of weeks leading up to spring break,” said Jessica Gate, head of mar-keting for Southwest Rec.
Students who plan to go to the gym 
this week should expect it to be a little more crowded than normal.
But does going to the gym for a cou-
ple of weeks before break starts even do anything worthwhile? 
Katie Roberts, the coordinator of fitness programs 
for Rec Sports, says that students shouldn’t expect to see any changes in just a couple of weeks.Gym attendance expected to rise

Gainesville’s cold and wet winter has made basking in 
the sun a priority for many students this spring break. But 
most want sun-kissed skin, not a trip to the emergency room.
Before you hit the beach, follow these recommendations 
to protect yourself from painful, harmful sunburn:
1. Protect yourself from the sun during the most intense 
times of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.  Plan outside activities for the 
early morning or late afternoon.2. Choose a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 and higher.  SPF only refers to protection 
against ultraviolet B (UVB) rays, so read the label to ensure you are protected against both ultraviolet A (UVA) and UVB 
rays.
3. Apply sunscreen at least 30 minutes prior to sun ex -
posure and reapply frequently. If you are particularly sensi -
tive to the sun, wear sun-protective clothing, a hat and sun -
glasses to protect your eyes.
There are many prescription and over-the-counter prod -
ucts that can make you more susceptible to sunburn. Use extra precaution if you are taking these or any other medi -
cations, which may enhance sun sensitivity in some indi -
viduals: birth control (tablets, ring or patch); antibiotics com -
monly prescribed for acne or urinary tract infections (UTIs); non-steroidal pain relievers (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen (Advil®) or naproxen (Aleve®); and/or cholesterol-lowering agents (“statins”).
Even ingredients in certain sunscreens can cause pho -
tosensitivity in some people. Avoid sunscreens that contain benzophenones (dioxybenzone and oxybenzone), para-
aminobenzoic acid (PABA), salicylates and cinnamates.If prevention fails and you become sunburned, it is im-
portant to treat the burn properly:
1. The extent of the burn will not be apparent until 12-24 
hours after sun exposure.  Keep the skin cool and moist 
by applying cool compresses. If skin is blistered, leave the blisters intact.2. Avoid tight clothing and apply moisturizer or aloe gel to hydrate the skin.  Avoid any topical products which 
contain numbing agents (for example, lidocaine, benzocaine or dibucaine) because you could become allergic to these products.3. DO NOT apply ointments or butter to a burn  as this will 
likely cause further damage to the skin.
4. Drink plenty of fluids  to prevent dehydration.
5. Pain relievers such as acetamino -
phen (Tylenol®), ibuprofen (Advil®) 
and naproxen (Aleve®) can help  with the 
discomfort and fever that may accompany sunburn. Antihistamines such as cetirizine (Zyrtec®), loratidine (Claritin®) or diphen -
hydramine (Benadryl®) can help with the 
itchiness that often accompanies sunburn.
6. Seek medical attention  if you experience a fever higher 
than 102° F, chills, dizziness or nausea.
If you have any questions or concerns, make an appoint -
ment with your UF Student Health Care Center primary care 
provider. For more information about sun protection and skin cancer prevention, visit the Skin Cancer Foundation’s website at www.skincancer.org.

l ALWAYS USE A CONDOM 
DURING ORAL SEX TO PRO-
TECT FROM STIs SUCH AS 
HPV, HERPES, CHLAMYDIA AND GONORRHEA.
You meet him or her at a club. 
You decide to hang out afterward and 
have a little fun—“nothing serious”—but if your after-hours play includes unprotected oral sex, you could eas-
ily bring home a sexually transmitted 
infection (STI).
Oral sex puts you in contact with 
skin and body fluids, any of which can contain disease-causing viruses or bacteria. 
STIs can be passed through oral 
sex, and spitting out semen will not 
protect you against them, as some of 
the virus or bacteria stays behind.
The most common STIs seen 
at the University of Florida Student 
Health Care Center (SHCC) are hu-
man papillomavirus (HPV), chlamyd-ia, gonorrhea and genital herpes.
Fortunately, the SHCC is available 
to help students with confidential test-
ing, counseling and treatment.
Protection used with every sexual act, including oral sex, will reduce the 
risk of acquiring an STI; however, re-member that skin not covered is not 
protected.
Following are four ways to protect 
yourself from contracting an STI:
1. Use protection. Use regular or fla-
vored condoms, or dental dams.2. Do not shave on or very close to the genitals. Shaving can leave cuts in the skin, which increase the likeli-
hood of infection.
3. Know your partner. If you see something suspicious on or near a po-tential sexual partner’s genitals, you 
may want to think twice!
4. Know yourself. Check your body 
regularly and see your health care provider with concerns.
If you have any questions or con-
cerns, make an appointment with your SHCC primary care provider.
For more information about sexual 
health and STIs, visit the American Social Health Association’s website at www.ashastd.org.

ASSOCIATED PRESS
CAIRO — A defiant Moammar 
Gadhafi vowed to fight to his “last 
drop of blood” and roared at sup-porters to strike back against Libyan protesters to defend his embattled 
regime Tuesday, signaling an es-
calation of the crackdown that has thrown the capital into scenes of mayhem, wild shooting and bodies in the streets.
The speech by the Libyan leader  
to impose control over the capital and take back other cities. After a week of upheaval, protesters backed 
by defecting army units have 
claimed control over almost the en-tire eastern half of Libya’s 1,000-mile Mediterranean coast, including sev-eral oil-producing areas.
“You men and women who love 
Gadhafi ... get out of your homes and fill the streets,” he said. “Leave your homes and attack them in their 
lairs.”
Celebratory gunfire by Gadhafi  
supporters rang out in the capital 
of Tripoli after the leader’s speech, while in protester-held Benghazi, Libya’s second-largest city , people threw shoes at a screen showing his address, venting their contempt.
State TV showed a crowd of Gad-
hafi supporters in Tripoli’s Green Square, raising his portrait and wav-ing flags as they swayed to music af-ter the address. Residents contacted by The Associated Press said no anti-government protesters ventured out of their homes after dark, and gun-toting guards manned checkpoints with occasional bursts of gunfire 
heard throughout the city.
International alarm rose over the 
crisis, which sent oil prices soaring 
to the highest level in more than two years on Tuesday and sparked a scramble by European and other countries to get their citizens out of the North African nation. 
The U.N. Security Council held 
an emergency meeting that ended with a statement condemning the crackdown, expressing “grave con-cern” and calling for an “immediate end to the violence” and steps to ad-dress the legitimate demands of the Libyan people.
Germany Chancellor Angela 
Merkel called Gadhafi’s speech 
“very , very appalling,” saying it 
“amounted to him declaring war on his own people.” Libya’s own depu-ty ambassador at the U.N., who now calls for Gadhafi’s ouster, has urged the world body to enforce a no-fly zone over the country to protect pro-testers.
“This violence is completely 
unacceptable,” added Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Gadhafi’s retaliation has already 
been the harshest in the Arab world 
to the wave of anti-government 
protests sweeping the Middle East. Nearly 300 people have been killed, according to a partial count by the New York-based Human Rights Watch.
In two nights of bloodshed, Trip-
oli residents described a rampage by pro-Gadhafi militiamen who shot 
on sight anyone found in the streets 
and opened fire from speeding ve-hicles at people watching from win-dows of their homes.
In a sign of the extent of the 
breakdown in Gadhafi’s regime, one of his closest associates, Abdel Fattah Younis, his interior minister and commander of the powerful Thunderbolt commando brigade, announced in Benghazi that he was defecting and other armed forces 
should join the revolt.
“I gave up all my posts in re-
sponse to the February 17 Revolu-
tion and my conviction that it has just demands,” Younis, who was among the army officers who joined Gadhafi in his 1969 coup, told Al-Jazeera, referring to the date of the start of the protests.
The performance by Gadhafi on 
state TV Tuesday night went far be-yond even the bizarre, volatile style he has been notorious for during nearly 42 years in power. 
Swathed in brown robes and 
a turban, wearing reflective sun-glasses, he at times screamed, his voice breaking, and shook his fists — then switched to reading glasses to read from a green-covered law book, losing his train of thought be-fore launching into a new round of shouting.
“Libya wants glory , Libya wants 
to be at the pinnacle, at the pin-nacle of the world,” he proclaimed, pounding his fist on the podium. “I am a fighter, a revolutionary from tents. ... I will die as a martyr at the end,” he said, vowing to fight “to my last drop of blood.”
Gadhafi portrayed the protesters 
as misguided youths, who had been given drugs and money by a “small, sick group” to attack police and 
government buildings. He said the 
uprising was fomented by a refer -
ence to Islamic fundamentalists and Libyans living abroad.
“Go out and fight them,” he 
added. 
In New York, Libya’s deputy 
U.N. ambassador Ibrahim Dabbashi, who has called for Gadhafi to step down, said he had received infor -
mation that Gadhafi’s collaborators have started “attacking people in all the cities in western Libya.” He said those being attacked are unarmed. He said Gadhafi was using foreign mercenaries to fight protesters.
“I think the genocide has started 
now in Libya,” Dabbashi said. “The Gadhafi statement was just code for 
his collaborators to start the geno-
cide against the Libyan people.”
Libyans were critical of what 
they saw as the lack of a forceful in-ternational response.
Gadhafi’s call for a popular attack 
on protesters reflected the deeply unstable nature of the system he has created over his rule — the longest of any current Arab leader. He has long kept his military and other se-curity forces relatively weak, fearing 
a challenge to his rule and uncertain 
of loyalties in a population of mul-tiple tribal allegiances.
So far, the crackdown has been 
waged chiefly by militias and so-called “revolutionary committees,” made up of Libyans and foreign fighters, many hired from other Af-rican nations.
Many army units in the east ap-
pear to have sided with protesters, and other more institutional parts of his regime have weakened. A string of ambassadors abroad have defect-ed, as has the justice minister.
Protesters claim to control a string 
of cities, from the Egyptian border in the east — where guards at the 
crossing fled — to the city of Ajd-
abiya, about 450 miles farther west along the Mediterranean coast, said Tawfiq al-Shahbi, a protest organiz-er in the eastern city of Tobruk.
Protesters and local tribesmen 
were protecting several of the fields and facilities around the city , said one resident, Ahmed al-Zawi.
Residents are also guarding one 
of Libya’s main oil export ports, Zu-weita, and the pipelines feeding into it, he said.
Two oil companies on Tuesday 
suspended production in the coun-try: Italy’s Eni — the biggest energy producer in Libya, producing about a quarter of its exports — and Spain’s Repsol-YPF, which produced 34,777 barrels in the country last year, about 3.8 percent of national output. 
Protesters over the weekend 
overran police stations and security headquarters in Benghazi, taking control of the streets.
“These are his dying words. He 
is a criminal and is ready to do any-thing. But we are ready for him,” al-Warfali said of Gadhafi’s speech. “Besides, most of his officers have 
deserted him anyway . He only has 
the mercenaries left.”
Since Sunday, the fiercest fight-
ing has been in Tripoli, the center of Gadhafi’s rule.
Tripoli residents on Tuesday 
were recovering from the militia rampage through multiple neigh-borhoods that began the night be-
fore and lasted until dawn. 
Some resident ventured out to 
find stores open for food, wary of 
militia attacks.
Buses unloaded militia fighters 
in several locations, he said. Others sped in vehicles with guns mounted on the top, opening fire, including at people watching from windows.
One of the heaviest battlegrounds 
was the impoverished, densely pop-ulated district of Fashloum. There, militiamen shot any “moving hu-man being” with live ammunition, including ambulances, so wounded 
were left in the streets to die, one 
resident said.
The head of the U.N. human 
rights agency , Navi Pillay , called for an investigation, saying widespread and systematic attacks against civil-ians “may amount to crimes against humanity.”WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 23, 2011 n ALLIGATOR, 15

A reduction in government spending 
could also reduce UF faculty retirement 
benefits. 
Gov. Rick Scott has proposed a plan to 
reform Florida’s retirement system to cut government spending.  
The Florida Retirement System’s An-
nual Report for 2009 said the state univer -sity system has 1,628 participants in the 
Deferred Retirement Program, also known 
as DROP , and 16,091 participants in the re-tirement system. 
The DROP program allows state em-
ployees to collect pension benefits while 
they are still working and earning a sal-
ary. 
The original intent of this program was 
to incentivize senior employees to retire 
but still allow them to receive money to offset the cost of health insurance until 
Medicare became available to them.
John Biro, a UF professor and president 
of the UF chapter of United 
Faculty of Florida, said that 
the proposal was “drastic and unacceptable.” 
According to Biro, the university’s fac-
ulty union represents 1,800 of the 4,000 UF faculty members. 
In a speech given on Feb. 1, Scott ex-plained his proposed overhaul of the state’s retirement system to help reduce the state’s $3.6 billion budget deficit. 
By eliminating DROP, Scott said he can 
save the state of Florida $2.8 billion over the course of two years.
Scott wants workers in the state pension 
system — teachers and other public em-ployees — to contribute 5 percent of their 
salaries to their 401(k) retirement plans. 
If the proposal passes, then DROP sys-
tem will cease to exist as of July 1. 
Current retirees in the program are said 
to remain unaffected.Scott’s retirement plan could reduce faculty benefits

Last season in the NCAA Gainesville Regional, 
Florida eliminated Florida Atlantic 15-0 behind six 
home runs. On Tuesday, the Gators won by 11 with-
out hitting a single round-tripper.
No. 1 Florida beat FAU 13-2 in a midweek con-
test played in Jupiter at Roger Dean Stadium, the 
spring training home of the Florida Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals. 
Behind 19 hits — 15 singles and five doubles — 
the Gators  (4-0) pounded the Owls (3-1) all evening, scoring multiple runs in the first, third, fifth and seventh innings.
“One of those nights we played well from the first 
inning all the way through to the end,” O’Sullivan 
said. “Had a chance to get a lot of guys in there. It 
was a great night overall.”
The Gators got on the board early with three 
first-inning runs, two on two-out knocks from Brian Johnson and Mike Zunino. 
UF plated three more runs in the third inning. 
After a sacrifice fly by Josh Adams, Daniel Pigott doubled over the center fielder’s head to bring in 
two more runs.

Florida junior left fielder Daniel Pigott led the Gators’ offensive explosion Tuesday night, going 4 for 5 at the plate with two RBIs. Pigott did not start on opening day but is 8 for 12 with three doubles and five RBIs in the last three games.
No. 1 Florida pounds FAU as pitchers continue hot start   
The NCAA rule changes are receiv-
ing a lot of attention for curbing run totals, lowering home run 
counts and batting averages this season.
But in Gainesville, there is a different 
reason for the smaller numbers: Florida’s pitching staff.
The Gators’ weekend rotation com-
bined to limit South Florida’s hitters to one run in 17 innings on the mound, posting a miniscule 0.65 WHIP to open the season last weekend. The only walk allowed by the starting pitchers (Brian Johnson, Hudson Randall and Karsten 
Whitson) came against the 57th batter 
they faced in the final game of the se-ries.
Florida carried its success on the 
mound over to Tuesday’s game against FAU, holding the Owls to seven hits and two runs.
All of these 
impressive stats 
could be due to 
the NCAA’s new standards for bats — if UF’s staff didn’t rack up similar stats late last season.
Using pinpoint control in last year’s 
NCAA Regional, Randall and Johnson 
accounted for 14.1 innings of work and 
gave up three runs. The two combined to strike out 14 batters while walking zero  before the new bats began being Deep UF staff impresses early

The Gators were already sitting pretty 
with a No. 1 national team ranking. 
Now, the gymnasts are making their 
marks in the individual ranks. 
Four UF gymnasts place in the nation’s 
top five performers in uneven parallel bars, 
balance beam, vault, floor exercise and all-
around. 
In the bars, freshman Alaina Johnson is 
tied for fifth place with two others in the individual rankings, which are based on 
an average that eliminates her nation-high 
score of 9.975. 
“Bars has always been one of my best 
events,” she said. “I try to focus during workouts on getting a good shape and 
just keeping real tight in one position and 
of course, hitting all my handstands. I like swinging bars, so it’s easier for me to want 
to work hard on that 
event.” 
In her position as an 
all-arounder, Johnson 
currently holds the na-
tion’s top score in a sin-
gle meet with a 39.675. 
Fellow freshman all-
arounder Mackenzie 
Caquatto is tied for the No. 2 ranking for balance beam. She said she spent the dura-
tion of her time in the gym focusing on the Gators adding individual 
rankings to team success

In the Gators’ last two games, the of-
fense won the accolades, but it was the de-
fense that anchored the victories.
With a mixture of high-pressure de-
fense and relentless pursuit from sopho-
mores Jaime Reeg and Sam Farrell, No. 17 Florida (2-1) has been able to limit each 
team it has faced this season to single-digit 
shot attempts in the first half.
“Jaime and Sam are physically strong. 
They have great feet. They’re quick, and 
they’re agile,” UF coach Amanda O’Leary 
said. “They’re just two really big and strong young ladies who can move along the 8-meter arc with ease.”Florida has caused six more turnovers 
than its competition in three games, creat-ing more free possessions for the offense and sophomore Kitty Cullen, the Ameri-can Lacrosse Conference Offensive Player 
of the Week. 
The Gators had 15 shots on goal in the 
first half against Denver on Sunday but 
only allowed three on defense. 
Reeg said the disparity between shots 
has been keyed by the team’s preparation for its opponent’s best player. Florida lim-ited the Pioneers’ leading scorer, attacker Kara Secora, to just one shot the entire 
game.
“The coaches really lay it out, what each 
player does, so we know what to expect 
when each one passes the ball, like wheth-er one does a lot of backdoors, drives from the top or crease rolls,” Reeg said. 
Florida will look for more of the same 
defensive intensity against Maryland Bal-
timore County today at 6:30 p.m. at Dizney 
Stadium.
The Retrievers (1-0) defeated George 
Mason 19-7 on Feb. 11 after jumping out to 
an 11-goal lead before halftime. 
It remains to be seen 
if UMBC can produce the 
same offensive output against the Gators on the 
road. Their win 12 days 
ago came at the expense of 
a Patriots team that went 3-14 last year.
O’Leary said she has seen Florida not 
only perform at a higher level defensively with each game, but also communicate better on the field due to Reeg and Far -
rell’s leadership. “Our communication improved, and 
we just trust each other so much more,” Farrell said. “We’re not hesitant to take risks because we know we’ll have our 
teammates to back us up and to slide. We 
just really trust each other now.”
Part of the reason the Gators have been 
able to take so many risks has been other 
teams’ talent level, Farrell said.
The defense has enjoyed competing 
against two consecutive offenses that play 
at a slower pace, with fewer fast breaks and drives down the center of the field. 
If a team tries to dump the ball inside the 
12-meter arc, Farrell and the defense are waiting.
“When we see them go to goal, we send 
our double [team],” Farrell said. “We real-ly closed our doubles, which made them, I guess, intimidated and they’d pull out and pass it over.”
n UF WILL TRY TO AVOID GETTING SWEPT BY VAN-
DERBILT AND GEORGIA THIS WEEK.

Coming off its first win in nearly a month, the Florida 
women’s basketball team has a shot at redemption. 
A season filled with close calls and near misses will 
culminate with opportunity. 
Two games remain in what has been a dismal regular-
season for the Gators (15-13, 5-9 Southeastern Confer -
ence). First, they will travel to Nashville on Thursday to 
take on Vanderbilt (18-9, 9-5 SEC), which beat Florida in double overtime Feb. 6. 
The Gators will then return home Sunday to play a 
Georgia team that overcame a 16-point second-half deficit to beat Florida at Stegeman Coliseum in January.  
“Both of them were games that, obviously, we wish we 
had back,” guard Jordan Jones said. 
Florida coach Amanda Butler agreed.“I’d be lying if I said there wasn’t extra motivation 
there,” Butler said, adding, “I thought those disappoint-ments were tough for us to bounce back from.”The numbers confirm Butler’s statement.At the time, both losses were Florida’s second in a row, 
and UF went on to lose four straight each time. After the Georgia game, Florida dropped another heartbreaker to Kentucky 59-58 in the O’Connell Center and added a 14-point loss at LSU.
Following the loss to Vanderbilt, the Gators had to 
travel to Knoxville, Tenn., where the Volunteers disman-tled them for the second time. Then, UF let a 10-point lead 
disappear in a loss at Alabama. 
When asked if wins in the last two 
games can salvage a substandard season that began with talk of championships, Jones said, “Yeah, in a way. I think the disappointment is still going to be there. You can’t get those games back.”
On a positive note for Florida, But-
ler pointed to the 50-point second half 
against Mississippi State on Sunday as a 
sign that her team’s best basketball is still to come.
“I still don’t think we’ve seen a complete ballgame,” 
Butler said. “I thought our second half [Sunday], espe-
cially on the offensive end, was pretty close to as good as we can play.” 
A sizeable portion of that success was due to the inte-rior play of forward Jennifer George.  The 6-foot junior didn’t miss a shot from the field and drained 7 of 12 free throws en route to her second 20-point game of the sea-son. 
After the victory, George texted her coach with a mes-
sage that read, “It was nice working with you this after -
noon.” 
Butler replied, “It’s nice working with you, too, when 
you don’t miss a shot.”
George has been on a roll as of late. The last time she 
scored 20 was four games ago against Vanderbilt.
In that meeting, Commodores center Stephanie Holzer 
and forwards Hannah Tuomi and Tiffany Clarke abused Florida in the paint to the tune of 66 points.   
“It was the post game that killed,” Florida center Aza-
nia Stewart said. “I think we have to take that on our shoulders as post players and really have to gameplan for them well.”
Even if the Gators are able to stop Vanderbilt and start 
their path to redemption, the sting of this season will live on.
“I definitely think it would leave a better taste in our 
mouths going into the offseason and preparing for next year,” Jones said “ But I don’t think it’s ever going to be not disappointing.”Florida looks to keep up defensive intensity vs. UMBC

HOT SHOTS
1. Kenny Boyton, So.
2. Vernon Macklin, Sr.
3. Erving Walker, JrAfter a three-way tie for first, Boynton gets the nod. 
The sophomore guard scored 17 points on 5-of-12 shooting, drained 6 of 7 free throws and filled the stat sheet with two assists, two steals and a block in UF’s 68-61 win over LSU. The Gators went from 9:01 to 3:11 in the second half without scoring a point, but Boynton broke the scoreless streak with a layup.
Macklin checks in at second after his 16-point, seven-rebound performance against the Tigers. The senior center scored 12 in the first half, helping the Gators take a 40-25 lead into the break. Macklin’s 
steal with 3:13 left in the game enabled Boynton’s 
layup, halting LSU’s comeback. He made 7 of 16 
shots from the field in 28 minutes of action.
Walker rounds out our list of the top three perform -
ers from the LSU game. The junior guard dropped
17 points on 5-of-10 shooting, including 3 of 6 from three-point range, and nailed four critical freethrows in the final two minutes to help seal the Ga -
tors’ win. Walker and Boynton combined for just 12first-half points but came alive in the second, pour -
ing in 22 after intermission.

Jocelyne Sanchez / Alligator Staffn THE FRESHMAN’S WORK 
VS. LSU EARNED PRAISE FROM BILLY DONOVAN.
  By GREG LUCA
 Alligator Staff Writer

 With the Gators’ most experi-
enced player sidelined by injury, 
the team has turned to one of its greenest freshmen. 
  While his stat line against LSU 
on Sunday may not have been im-pressive, swingman Casey Prather drew praise from coach Billy Don-ovan after his ﬁ  rst collegiate start 
in place of the injured Chandler 
Parsons.
  “He had good 
energy, he did a 
good job defen-
sively and over-
all I was pleased with the way he 
played,” Donovan said.  
  The freshman logged 15 min-
utes and failed to score a point on 0-for-2 shooting. He also recorded three rebounds, an assist and a steal without a turnover. 
  Donovan acknowledged that 
Prather’s performance was not ﬂ  awless but credited the freshman for showing a strong work ethic 
and a desire to get better over the 
past two weeks.  
  Prather had played 6.9 minutes 
per game prior to No. 13 Gators’ 68-61 win at LSU but was forced into a starting role as the only other natural small forward on the roster. 
  Although not as versatile as 
Parsons, the 6-foot-6 Prather pro-vides a combination of size, speed and athleticism none of the other reserves can match. 
  Those attributes have made Prather a strong defensive option off the bench in limited minutes and led Donovan to incorporate 
more on-the-ball pressure into his 
game plan Sunday against the Ti-gers. 
  “I just felt like we’re a better 
pressing team when Casey is out 
there,” Donovan said. “With his athleticism and his length, we just 
felt like we wanted to utilize him.”
  Although the Gators have used 
the press sparingly in Southeastern Conference play, Donovan thought the matchup against LSU would be the perfect time to bring it back. 
  According to Donovan, the Ti-
gers are efﬁ  cient on offense when they have the luxury of entering their half-court sets. He hoped the press would “disrupt their ﬂ  ow” 
and force them to improvise rather 
than run designed plays. 
  Donovan also noted that the 
press would be an effective way for the younger players to deal 
with the jitters of seeing increased 
minutes in Parsons’ absence. 
  Instead of letting nerves build 
up while they grind through a 
half-court defense, freshmen such 
as Prather were allowed to get out and run. 
  “I thought if we could get the 
game going up and down, it may 
take some pressure off of those 
guys, being young guys on the road, having to play more signiﬁ  -cant minutes than they previously 
had,” Donovan said. 
  Another freshman asked to ﬁ  ll 
in for Parsons was Scottie Wil-
bekin, who played 30 minutes despite averaging 16.9 per game 
beforehand. 
  Wilbekin was often used in a 
lineup that featured fellow guards 
Erving Walker and Kenny Boyn-
ton. That three-guard set presented 
another quick, scrappy defensive lineup that provided an effective press. 
  The press showed some rust 
and only forced 12 giveaways Sun-day against LSU.
  When asked after the game, 
Boynton said it was much more 
disruptive in the second half, call-
ing it “50-50” overall.   Prather brings defensive prowess in place of Parsons

Florida sophomore all-arounder Ashanée Dickerson is tied for fifth in the national vault 
rankings, second in the all-around and tied for first in the floor routine.
UF focused on holding No. 1 spot
finer details, while she was only concerned 
about physically staying on the beam. 
“Every chin up and every finish really 
makes a difference on what the judges really 
think about your routine,” she said. “Even 
if it’s not the greatest, the way you present 
yourself can make them think, ‘Oh, that’s the best she’s ever done it,’ because they’ve 
never seen you compete before, which can have a really big effect on your score.” 
Caquatto’s mentality garnered a 9.975 
on beam, a collegiate-best for the Illinois 
native, this weekend in West Virginia.
Sophomore all-arounder Ashanée Dick-
erson also racked up a 9.975 on balance 
beam this season and is no stranger to reel-
ing in the big scores. 
Dickerson has been one of the Gators’ 
most prominent performers since coming 
to UF.
This season, the two-time All-American 
is tied for fifth on vault, ranks second in all-around and is tied for first on floor. 
Dickerson said she feels she has im-
proved her polish with the finish of each meet.  
“I’ve gotten a lot cleaner throughout the 
season,” she said. “Focusing on my land-
ings, making sure they’re good and not 
stepping around or moving my feet once I land.” 
Though sophomore Marissa King isn’t 
nationally ranked on floor, because she hasn’t competed in at least three away meets, she has matched the nation’s top floor score (9.975), receiving a 10 from half of the judging panel against Alabama. 
“When I got that score, it was so fun,” 
she said. “I was going crazy. It was a really special moment. I’ll remember it for a long time and how I felt when I got it.” 
In addition to the gymnasts’ individual 
rankings, the Gators’ team ranking is also first in the nation — the first time UF gym-nastics has accomplished that in program history. 
Although the gymnasts are making their 
marks nationally, they all are focused on maintaining the top spot for the team. 
“I don’t want to slow down,” Dickerson 
said. “I just want to keep motivated and working hard to stay at No. 1.”GYM , from page 16
used.
These two sophomores provide UF 
with a pair of pitchers who keep the ball 
over the plate and can be relied upon to rack up quality starts. 
Johnson finished his freshman year 
with just 14 walks in 73.2 innings pitched and lasted an average of more than five innings per start. Randall walked 21 hit-ters in 97.1 innings of work in his first year as a Gator. And he pitched an aver -
age of about 5.2 innings per start.
But neither possesses half the talent 
freshman hurler Karsten Whitson does. 
Much has been made about Whitson be-
ing the ninth overall selection in last year’s MLB Draft, but he backed  up the hype with his first collegiate start Sunday.
The right-hander impressed with his 
mid-90s stuff against USF, baffling hitters in five scoreless innings while giving up one hit and striking out nine. 
Whitson’s emergence has pushed Alex 
Panteliodis, who was Florida’s Friday night starter last season, out of the week-end rotation — for now.
There are even pitchers in UF’s bull-
pen who can compete for a weekend spot if Johnson, Randall and Whitson slip up. Tommy Toledo and Anthony DeSclafani, currently Gators relievers, already pos-sess experience in that role.
DeSclafani made his case to coach 
Kevin O’Sullivan on Tuesday, starting in place of a sick Panteliodis and pitching four scoreless innings against FAU.
Even Austin Maddox, who led the 
team in home runs and RBIs last season, is attempting to receive some time on the mound, making his pitching debut Tues-day.
Maybe getting hitters out won’t be the 
toughest challenge Gators pitchers face this season. Earning a spot in the rotation seems hard enough.ANTHONY , from page 16DeSclafani throws four shutout frames
the offensive onslaught for the Gators as 
both went 4 for 5 with two RBIs. 
After not starting on opening day, Pig-
ott, a junior left fielder, has relished his opportunities, going 8 for 12 with three doubles and five RBIs in the last three games. 
UF continued its outstanding pitching 
as Anthony DeSclafani made the emer -
gency start for Alex Panteliodis, who did not make the trip because of an undis-closed illness.
DeSclafani went four scoreless innings 
with three strikeouts, allowing just three 
hits and no walks. The right-hander es-
caped trouble in the first, getting two outs 
with runners on the corners.
“He battled through that first inning,” 
O’Sullivan said. “But overall, I thought he 
threw the ball great. We’re going to need 
him. He’s greatly improved from a year ago.” 
UF had six pitchers throw on the eve-
ning, but its scoreless streak of 22.2 in-
nings — which dated back to the first inning of Saturday’s game against South Florida — ended when freshman Jona-
thon Crawford gave up a solo bomb to 
Owls center fielder Nathan Pittman in 
the sixth inning. Florida’s Nick Maronde 
gave up another solo shot in the seventh 
inning. 
Etc.:  Austin Maddox, 
who earlier this spring 
O’Sullivan said would 
pitch for UF sometime 
this season, threw a score-
less ninth with two strikeouts. … In its first 
four games, UF has surrendered just two 
walks and one error. “No walks, no er -
rors, you always got a chance,” O’Sullivan said. … FAU committed four errors on the 
night. … O’Sullivan changed the lineup, 
moving Adams out of the two-hole.BASEBALL , from page 16
