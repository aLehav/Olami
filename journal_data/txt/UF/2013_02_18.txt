A new website — which claims to have been 
made by the “silent majority” — criticizes the 
Swamp Party and its presidential candidate.
The website www.thetruthaboutbon.org was 
created Saturday , according to search results from 
www.whois.net. The website is registered to Gra-
cie Freewaters and at 1142 Panhellenic Drive, UF’s Zeta Tau Alpha sorority house.
However, according to the UF directory, Free-
waters is not a student. The phone number regis-tered to the site did not return a message for com-ment.
Swamp Party presidential candidate Christina 
Bonarrigo said she doesn’t think one of her Zeta 
sisters created the site.
“It’s a nameless person who hides behind a 
screen because nothing they say is true,” she said.
Swamp Party spokesman Elliot Grasso said he 
hadn’t seen the website until Sunday evening.
“Considering all sources are anonymous, it 
doesn’t seem very credible,” he said.
Bonarrigo said she isn’t worried about ﬁ  nding 
out who created it and will continue to focus on 
campaigning. She said she doesn’t believe the Stu-dents Party created the website and called on her opponent, Johnny Castillo, to denounce it.
Representatives of the Students Party  said they 
had nothing to do with it.
Grier Ferguson, a Students Party spokeswom-
an, said she was surprised to ﬁ  nd out about the website.
“As [the Students Party] exec slate, it would be 
nothing we approve,” she said.
Ferguson added that her party wants to focus 
on voting, not “slamming” a particular candidate.
“We don’t want it to be associated with our 
party,” she said.

About 800 students congregated on 
Turlington Plaza on Friday to thrust, 
bump, grind and ﬂ  ail for about 30 sec-onds.
When the music stopped, the crowd 
quickly dispersed as if nothing hap-pened.This dance routine known as the 
“Harlem Shake” has gone viral.
The original Harlem Shake video, 
“DO THE HARLEM SHAKE (ORIGI-NAL),” was uploaded on Jan. 30, ac-
cording to an ABC News blog. But, it 
wasn’t until the “The Harlem Shake v1 
(TSCS original),” uploaded on Feb. 2, 
formed the standards for the videos, ac-
cording to YouTube Trends. That video 
has about 11.3 million views. The real 
dance has Ethiopian roots and began in Harlem, N.Y., in 1981, according to ABC 
News.
Seth Lindstrom, a 20-year-old me-
chanical engineering junior, organized the ﬂ  ash mob version of the dance for UF students.
He invited about 100 people to the 
Facebook event he created, but through social networking, about 1,200 people clicked that they would attend.

Gainesville Police is investigating a Sun-
day morning burglary at a downtown apart-
ment complex that left a UF graduate student injured and sparked authorities to send out a UF Alert to students, faculty and staff.
Ofﬁ  cers responded to the Continuum 
apartment complex, located in the 400 block of West University Avenue, and found the victim with a cut on her head and a pool of blood on her living room ﬂ  oor.
The woman told police that just after she returned home from the Grog House Bar & Grill at about 2:45 a.m. Sunday, she heard a knock at her front door.
She answered it, and a man forced him-
self into her apartment, punched her in the 
head and ran away from the complex, said 
GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias.
Tobias said because the man didn’t say 
anything to the woman at the time of the at-tack, police are ruling out sexual battery and robbery as a possible motive.Because the apartment complex is afﬁ  liat-
ed with UF’s Housing and Residence Educa-tion, university ofﬁ  cials sent out a UF Alert at about 10:30 a.m. Sunday to inform students, faculty and staff about the incident.
The message also reminded recipients to 
keep their residences locked and to make sure they know who is at the door before answering it.

Feb. 17, 1972: Gainesville found its very own Lady 
Godiva — and she was a “true blonde.” An unnamed woman reportedly ran along 13th Street stark-naked. She ended up at the intersection of 13th Street and University Avenue. A crowd formed around her as 
she screamed incoherently until police arrived. She 
refused any offerings of clothing, so she rode in hand-cuffs to the Alachua General Hospital.
Feb. 18, 1981: Several Gainesville banks reported re-
ceiving counterfeit $20 bills. Secret Service agent Rob-ert Warner said Interstate 75 attracts counterfeiters, as it is a quick route to transfer money north and south. A gas station owner also received a false bill — it was 
a dollar bill with $20 corners added on. Local bank-
ers said trends of finding counterfeit bills often come and go.
Feb. 21, 1997: UF researchers received a $4 million 
grant to study HIV in women. They hoped to use it 
to develop a new medical treatment for the virus by studying the effects of stress and other psychological ailments on the early progression of HIV in women. 
Researchers at other universities had already drawn 
a connection between stress and the rapid rates of progression of the virus.
Feb. 22, 2006: A Gainesville dog named Cujo found 
human remains in his owner’s yard. The Labrador 
retriever mix found a rib bone of what crime scene investigators guessed was from a small person, pos-sibly a female. Four days later, he found a skull. Po-
lice excavated the land and found a few other bones. 
They guessed the remains might have come from a nearby cemetery.

Gainesville Police arrested a Regional Transit System bus 
driver Friday night for allegedly stealing two cellphones.
Police charged Kathryn Spencer, 45, of 4100 SW 20th Ave., 
with two counts of grand theft, said GPD spokesman Officer 
Ben Tobias.
Tobias said Spencer allegedly took a $600 cellphone Fri-
day after she stopped at Hunters Run Apartments, located at 2600 SW Williston Road, during her break.
After Spencer returned to her bus, apartment manage-
ment reported to police an office manager’s cellphone was missing. The manager told police the only person who went in and used the bathroom during that time was an RTS bus driver. The office manager used a GPS program to track her missing phone and found out it followed the same path as 
Spencer’s bus route, Tobias said.During questioning with police, Spencer said someone 
turned in the phone to her on the bus. She added that RTS 
drivers are required to turn in lost and found property be-
fore the end of their shifts. Spencer at first denied taking the officer manager’s phone but later admitted it was in her trunk, ac-cording to the report.
When officers searched Spencer’s car, 
they found the office manager’s phone 
and a cellphone that belonged to Jenne Nekole Patterson. Patterson reported her phone stolen Jan. 15 after she left it on a windowsill outside of a Reitz Union bath-
room, according to the report. 
After her arrest, officers booked Spencer into the Alachua 
County Jail. Spencer was released just before 2 p.m. Saturday 
on her own recognizance, a jail official said.

After a 24-hour designing and 
programming competition, TXT TAG 
will have a new mobile application and an improved website that allows users to send messages by only know-
ing a license plate tag.
The new app was developed dur -
ing a hackathon competition this 
weekend at the Gainesville Hacker -
space, located at 101 SE Second Place, Suite 100.Good Ol’ Original Design Inc. 
hosted the event with three teams working to develop a TXT TAG app 
for iPhone and Android devices and 
an improved website.
Matthew Carroll narrowly beat 
another five-person team by himself to win a $500 cash prize for his An-droid app design.
Carroll, a 24-year-old mobile de-
veloper, said he was excited to win.
“It feels great,” he said. “Honestly, 
after seeing the other presentations, I didn’t think I would.”
Katie Russ, 23, and Sam Sewall, 20, 
won for their TXT TAG Web app.
Although several people signed 
up for the iOS app competition, none participated.
Eric L. Pheterson, a 24-year old 
UF aerospace and mechanical engi-
neering alumnus and chief executive 
officer for Gold Ol’ Original Design Inc., said the app developed from the competition will allow users to con-tact car owners who may be blocking them in a parking lot or have left their headlights on.
He said his company plans to part-
ner with University Police so officers 
can use the app to warn drivers of 
traffic violations.

Turlington Plaza was packed with more than 800 students dancing to “Harlem Shake” 
by Baauer on Friday afternoon. Their video is one of 40,000, according to YouTube.
A costumed Gator thrust, the beat dropped — then students went wild
out as planned, Lindstrom, the sound and 
camera crews arrived on Turlington Plaza around 11:50 a.m.
Before the bumpers and flailers ar -
rived, Karim Hussain, a 20-year-old mar -
keting junior, positioned himself on the outside stairwell of the plaza and filmed Lindstrom standing on a small wooden box, thrusting into the air — shirtless and masked with a Gator head.
That’s the first ingredient to a Harlem 
Shake video — a lone dancer in a normal setting.
As they filmed, Billy Triggs, a 22-year-
old industrial and systems engineering senior, set up his sound system and three speakers.
By 12:20 p.m., they were ready for the 
dancers.
The banana, Lego man and Santa 
Claus costumes slowly filed in, and stu-dents quickly began to stand shoulder to shoulder.
At 12:40 p.m., there was no way to get to class through the plaza.
Lindstrom took stage on his small plat-
form in the middle. “Harlem Shake” by Baauer began to blast through the speak-ers. He thrusted by his lonesome while the sea of dancers stood motionless. The beat dropped and the 800 students joined in bumping and flailing.
One dancer, Sabrina Mone, a 20-year-
old nursing sophomore, did a front flip over a pole at the front of the crowd.
“I was actually trying to leapfrog over 
the pole,” she said.
The flash mob ended in the “Go 
Gators” and “It’s Great to be a Florida Gator” chants.
Afterward, they returned to their daily 
activities in their Mad Hatter and con-struction worker costumes.
The video, “Official UF Harlem Shake,” 
was uploaded Friday night and is one of 40,000 Harlem Shake videos, according to the YouTube Trends.
As of Sunday, Lindstrom’s video had 
about 197,000 views.
“I definitely wanted to put us on the 
map,” Lindstrom said.ShAke , from page 1locAl

Sam Parrish stood in line Sat-
urday night under the rafters of a 
warmly lit pavilion, looking earnest-ly for a cricket cupcake.
“Is that the last one?” she asked 
as a man reached for the lone choco-late-frosted treat sitting in a tin tray.
He retreated, and the 21-year-old 
UF alumna made off with the last cupcake.
Parrish joined about 400 other 
people eager to taste dishes with un-usual ingredients at the UF Wildlife Society’s 30th Annual Beast Feast at the Whitehurst Lodge in Archer.
Carnivores shuffled past two 
lines of tables crowded under the rafters of the pavilion, scooping en-trees such as deer liver with onions, buffalo lasagna and fried Burmese python from tin dishes.
Thomas Seberry , a 24-year-old 
UF second-year veterinary medicine graduate student, said the event ap-pealed to him because it let him ex-
perience school subjects from a dif-
ferent angle.
“I work on these animals,” he 
said. “It’s this, maybe sick, desire – ‘I wonder what they taste like?’”
All of the meat was donated, said William Giuliano, a UF assistant professor of wildlife ecology and conservation and faculty adviser for the wildlife club.
Cody Godwin, a 23-year-old UF 
wildlife and ecology conservation senior, said he and six other students collected about 400 Cuban anole liz-ards from around UF’s campus.
Godwin said his group hunted 
the lizards at night, plucking the sleeping amphibians from foliage near Newins-Ziegler Hall and the 
Natural Area Teaching Laboratory.
Anoles are considered an in-
vasive species in Florida, Godwin 
said, and offering them as part of the menu synced with this year’s event theme: raising awareness about in-vasive species.
On Saturday night, Godwin 
stood at the end of a buffet line, 
handing out samples of the fried 
critters. In the pan, they looked like shriveled onion rings.
Brian Gervais, a police officer 
from Martin County , ate a lizard for the first time.“It tasted like really, really tiny al-
ligators,” he said. “It’s kind of, like, 
funky-earthy.”
His daughter, Monica Gervais, 
tried one, too. When the 20-year-old 
UF third-year pharmacy graduate student crunched into the lizard, she compared the taste to an  “overly fried french fry.”
When he ate the lizard, Brian 
Gervais held it like corn on the cob 
and pulled the meat off with his 
teeth to “get the full flavor.”
“That’s how you taste the meat 
itself,” he said.

There might be something “phishy” 
going on with UF emails.
Someone sends an email as a legiti-
mate UF source, when it is really just a 
piece of bait. Then someone might lure 
students into giving personal identify-
ing information that he or she then uses for his or her own gain.
Due to the influx in reports of these 
scams, UF Information Technology re-minded students that no one from the university will ever ask for a Gatorlink password or complete social security number.
In an email interview,  UFIT Com-
munications Manager Tracy Gale wrote the email and phone scams have been targeting students, faculty and staff from academic and administrative sec-tors.
Last week, Ada Kokoshi, a 20-year-
old finance sophomore, experienced an email “phishing” scam attempt.
She received an email to her UF 
Webmail account from a seemingly le-gitimate UF email address that told her that her account was compromised and she needed to go to a website to change her password.
“When I looked at it, I knew some-
thing was ‘phishy,’” she said. “Even the word ‘different’ was spelled wrong.”
Kokoshi said she doesn’t give her 
password out, so she deleted the email.
Gale said if anyone in the UF com-
munity receives a phone call or email requesting personal information, they should email or call the UF Computing Help Desk with the details.
She said the only time the help desk 
may need the last four digits of a stu-dent’s Social Security number is when 
a student forgets his or her password or 
needs a password reset. Even then, no one at the desk can see a students’ full Social Security number.
UFIT issues alerts when a threat is 
identified, Gale said.
In order to combat the phone and 
email scams, she said UFIT wants to teach UF students about the importance 
of Internet safety through ongoing 
outreach activities, including contests, events on campus and frequently up-dated information on the UFIT sites. UF email suffers scams � STUDENTS WILL STILL TAKE SPRING

Carnival’s latest cruise ship ordeal may not 
affect one of their consumer groups much at 
all.
Andrew Pisacano has already booked his 
Carnival cruise ship for Spring Break, and he 
plans on keeping it.
The 21-year-old statistics junior will be 
heading to Mexico from a port in Tampa for a 
five-night cruise. He said if anything, Carnival won’t let it happen again.
“If it does, we have a story to tell and a re-
fund,” Pisacano said.
Last week, the Carnival cruise ship Tri-
umph, which held about 3,000 passengers, 
was pulled into a port in Mobile, Ala. On Feb. 
10, a fire in the engine room caused most of the ship’s power to stop functioning, according to ABC News.
Food supplies and medicine for elderly 
passengers were running short, and pipes had burst, causing sewage to leak into the rooms.
According to NBC News, passengers were 
instructed to relieve themselves in bags that 
the crew would come by to pick up.
Triumph passengers were reimbursed for the cruise, given a free future cruise and $500.
Despite the recent incident, Sirah Mora and 
Reynaldo Calzadilla don’t want to rule Carni-
val out as a future possibility.
Mora, an 18-year-old international studies 
freshman, said Carnival did a good job han-dling the situation because everyone was safe.
She said she and Calzadilla, a 19-year-old 
computer engineering freshman, had begun looking at Carnival cruises for this upcom-ing Spring Break but ultimately ruled it out because Carnival required one person in the group booking to be at least 25 years of age.
Both students said they first chose Carnival 
because of the price.
Calzadilla, who has been on two Carnival 
cruises already, said he believes students in general will react similarly to how he and Mora did. He said money is a big deal to students, whereas families with young children would probably be more concerned about safety.
Like Mora and Calzadilla, Pisacano was

The Five Points of Life Foundation and LifeSouth blood 
bank hosted five races this weekend to promote a healthy life-
style and raise awareness for blood donations.
The events started early Saturday morning with 400 run-
ners participating in a 5K race and about 700 children running 
a 1.2-mile childrens’ marathon. 
The following day, 939 runners battled cold weather to run 
in half marathon, marathon and marathon relay races.
The races started on UF’s campus, taking some runners 
through Ben Hill Griffin Stadium and continuing as far north 
as Northwest 16th Avenue.
Sam Zhdanov competed in Saturday’s 5K race and fin-
ished second in 17 minutes and 38.5 seconds.
Zhdanov, a 15-year-old Gainesville High School freshman, 
said he has been running in Five Points of Life events for the last four years. 
He said the race’s cause meant a lot to him.“I think it’s really important, and being healthy is so im-
portant,” he said.
Brite Whitaker, director of the Five Points of Life Founda-
tion, has been coordinating the race weekend for seven years.
She said awareness and education are the goals of the 
foundation.
“It’s a great way for us to put on a healthy, well-run event 
in our community that’s focused on awareness and encour -
aging people to get out, be healthy and enjoy exercising and running,” she said.
A LifeSouth bloodmobile was parked at the finish line Sun-
day with sign-up sheets for blood, organ and bone marrow donors.
Whitaker said more than 50 people donated blood during 
the event.
Gary Kirkland, a 62-year-old media specialist with Life-
South, said he hoped the races helped spread the word about the benefits of blood donations to people who need it.
“It takes only a few minutes to donate blood,” he said, 
“and for somebody, that can make a lifetime of difference.”Runners speed through weekend marathonsSTATE

The Florida Park Service has released 
a free smartphone application that 
allows users to receive instant access to information on all of Florida’s 171 state parks, trails and historic sites.
The app includes several features such 
as GPS mapping, a calendar of events and an alert that can be used in case of emergency, said Jennifer Diaz, external communications manager with the Florida Park Service.“We want to increase access to visitors 
in the parks and help plan trips to state parks,” Diaz said.
Diaz said the park service partnered 
with ParksByNature Network and Pocket Ranger to create the app.
Plans for the app began in the summer, 
she added, but development didn’t start until the fall. The app is currently available for Android and iPhone devices.
“We are encouraging people to 
download the application,” Diaz said, “and use the app to plan a trip to their 
favorite park.”Diaz said users who download the 
app onto their phones can get into any of 
Florida’s state parks for free today.
Simone Nageon de Lestang, a 22-year-
old  UF natural resource conservation senior and a lead guide for TRiP , said she goes to state parks at least five to six weekends during the year.
She said the app is a good idea for 
residents who visit parks across the state.
“We have the best state parks in the 
nation,” she said. “If it’s going to promote state parks, that’s wonderful. It seems 
helpful.”Florida Park Service releases free parks app

A new study by UF researchers has 
found a different region of the brain to 
help control anxiety or fear. This means people could have more control over their anxiety disorders or phobias.
Other therapies exist to help with 
anxiety disorders and phobias, but this discovery could lead to a new type of treatment. Future research would test what happens when people can control the way they look at something fearful.
The treatment would train the visual 
response. 
“The surprising result is that the vi-
sual part of the brain would be a good target for treatment,” said Andreas Keil, co-author of the experiment.
The findings were published last 
month in the Journal of Neuroscience by Keil and Vladimir Miskovic, both mem-
bers of the UF Center for the Study of 
Emotion and Attention.
Keil said both he and Miskovic have 
worked on the study for 15 years, and they just got the sense to isolate the visu-al cortex and test it. For the experiment, 
21 undergraduate participants looked at 
“silent” and “loud” shapes on a screen. The loud shapes were followed by an un-pleasant, high static noise, Keil said.The silent shape was a safety cue and the loud shape was a threat cue. 
The brainwave reactions in their visual 
cortices showed the participants learned to fear the loud shapes. When both of 
the shapes appeared on the screen, the 
participants ignored the safety cue and focused only on the threat.
Lizzy Slonena, president of the UF 
Neuroscience Club, said the study is in-novative.
“We always have this outline that we 
think psychology goes by and when new information comes out, it’s groundbreak-
ing” said the 22-year-old psychology se-
nior.Study might

difference.”

How a cruise went 
horribly awry 
Guys, last week CNN devoted 758 broadcast minutes in 
a 24-hour period to coverage of the now infamous poop ship.
Yes, poop ship is the colloquial term for the Carnival ship  
Triumph. It’s a hilarious name for a really gross vacation.
A Carnival cruise ship sustained damage from a ﬁ  re onboard 
that stranded the ship for days in the Gulf of Mexico.
“There were the immediate concerns, among them how to 
get the passengers home once they got off the ship, a process that was set to begin shortly after the ship docked Thursday at 9:30 p.m. Central time,” said a New York Times report. “Also at issue was how and why a ﬁ  re came to knock out the propulsion system, the power, and the sewage, heating and air-conditioning systems on the 14-year-old ship, which had mechanical troubles 
last month that delayed a similar cruise to Mexico. “
The sewage is the main problem here. People had to poop 
into bags; sewage was leaking everywhere. It sounded like a 
horrible time.
“It’s like being locked in a Porta Potty for days,” said Peter 
Cass, a physician from Beaumont, Tex., as the ship got closer to Mobile, Ala., on Thursday, according to The New York Times ar-ticle. “We’ve lived through two hurricanes, and this is worse.”
But they were still on a cruise, so the food was amazing.
Some people had to eat “jelly and bread and zucchini and 
red onion sandwiches” while other passengers had lobster and 
chocolate cake, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The running joke of the story is that CNN wouldn’t exactly 
cover the “ﬂ  oating Petri dish” until it was covered in poop.
And then it was like they couldn’t stop giving it news cover-
age. Those 758 broadcast minutes add up to about 52 percent of the day, according to BuzzFeed.
Maybe the media gives way too much attention to things 
once they get weird, but we should also be paying attention to a stranded cruise ship no matter what. Through the investigation of what journalists could do from shore, we learned some pretty neat things about the incident.
“I just wanted to vomit, like every second probably,” said 
12-year-old passenger Allie Taylor, according to a CNN article.
The most heartening facts, though, were tales of how the 
crew handled the debacle.
“The crew worked around the clock to try to make the situa-
tion somewhat bearable,” read the CNN article. “They constant-ly checked on passengers, often with smiles on their faces.”
Thank goodness. Apparently losing power on a cruise ship 
is not as enjoyable as getting, like, locked in a mall like that one episode of “The O.C.”
Maybe it’s on us as a society to not go on such lavish va-
cations. Like, we’re so sorry that our luxury giant boat had a problem, and now we can’t eat all-we-can-eat like we originally thought. 
Suck it, foreign countries that are struggling to put food on 
the table!
We need better priorities. We need to focus on real problems.
We need to not broadcast poop ship for most of a news day.Like you, I take the upcoming Student Government 
election very seriously.
Or maybe you don’t take the upcoming SG election 
very seriously , in which case we are no longer friends (or if 
we weren’t friends before, we are now; so there).
As you know, a central part of being a serious election 
taker is arguing about issues.  
As Americans, we have a constitutional duty to argue 
indiscriminately about issues and to refuse to concede even the smallest point to our opponent by dismissing their argu-ments with eye rolls and condescending sighs.
This duty applies to the SG elections as well.Unfortunately, I ﬁ  nd it difﬁ  cult (but not impossible!) to ar-
gue about things I know nothing about. Today, I will present in a special edition of the-column-by-that-crazy-dude-with-the-beard a guide to each party’s stances on the issues that mean the most to all of us.
All information is taken from ofﬁ  cial party websites, Face-
book pages or other productions. Except for the stuff I made up.
1. FREE SPEECHFree speech is an issue very close to the empty space 
where my heart should be. I believe government should pro-tect free speech — not try to actively restrict it. For example, say there are two hypothetical publications.
We’ll call them the Iliad and the Crocodile.  One of them has been ﬁ  ghting a losing battle with a gov-
ernment allied with the other over a vaguely illegal attempt to severely hinder its circulation. If the party in power were to support free speech, perhaps this battle could be won. Hy-pothetically. Let’s see what the parties say about it.
STUDENTS PARTY: “The Students Party stands for free 
speech.”
SWAMP PARTY: “Lunch with Christina — have lunch 
on the lawn every two weeks to talk to students about their needs.”
Is this lunch free? Is it scheduled, or is she just going to 
show up randomly every two weeks and start asking stu-dents about their needs? Whose lawn? What kind of needs are we talking about here? How many hypothetical ques-tions are you allowed to ask before a gag gets played out? The Swamp Party has not answered any of these questions. Possibly because I didn’t ask them.
ADV ANTAGE: STUDENTS 
PARTY
2. STANDINGAs you all know, I am a big 
supporter of standing. I do it at 
least three times a day . Standing in, standing up, standing down, standing for — these are all great things we can do because of our constitutional right to stand. How do the par-ties compare in the stances on standing?
STUDENTS PARTY: “The Students Party stands…”SWAMP PARTY: “Newell Hall study center to allow stu-
dents to study 24/7.”
I don’t know about you, but I never study standing up. 
So I think the Swamp Party is opposed to standing. I’m not going to take this sitting down!
ADVANTAGE: STUDENTS PARTY3. HAVING “STUDENTS” IN THE NAME OF THEIR 
PARTY
This one is self-explanatory.ADVANTAGE: STUDENTS PARTYWell, with a score I wasn’t keeping track of, the Students 
Party wins my vote. I found representatives of both parties to interview for their reactions to this.
Students Party representative: “What are you doing here? 
This is my bedroom! It’s like 4:30 in the morning!! I’m calling the cops!!!” 
Swamp Party representative: “Dallin invented me. Like, 
right now. He didn’t even do that right, either. He made me a 50-year-old, retired, Polish ballerina. I don’t have anything to say about some dumb SG election. I don’t even speak Eng-lish!”
I want to end on a serious note. Save the racks. Fight 
breast cancer.

Peace Corps is committed to UF
The Peace Corps is committed to maintain-
ing a strong relationship with the UF commu-
nity and will have regular recruiter presence on campus to further support students and graduates who want to serve overseas, con-
trary to the assertions in the opinion column, 
“Peace Corps celebrates UF’s grads, but cur -
rent students are left in the dark,” on Feb. 12.
So that it can better serve potential volun-
teers, Peace Corps is employing a field-based recruitment approach in Florida and across the country. This means that instead of work-ing out of a central office where potential ap-plicants come to them, field-based recruiters 
work virtually and go to potential applicants 
in their regions. This approach is more com-munity-based and helps Peace Corps cast an even wider net for the best applicants.Chad Chernet is the UF’s new field-based 
recruiter, and he has already put significant energy toward meeting people from the Peace Corps community on campus. In addition, regional staff members have been in com-munication with university administrators to ensure that Peace Corps is well-positioned for 
continuing recruitment success.
Earlier this month, we recognized UF as 
the Peace Corps Top College. UF consistently 
produces graduates who are committed to making a difference. I have no doubt that re-cord numbers of UF graduates will continue to change the world through Peace Corps.

Carrie Hessler-Radelet
Peace Corps acting directorLocal officials shouldn’t restrict voting
Rep. Dennis Baxley and Alachua 
GOP chairman Stafford Jones should be 
ashamed of their efforts to restrict voting 
rights and opportunities for college stu-
dents. 
Voters are already forced to wait in line 
for hours on Election Day.
Political leaders should be working to 
make voting an easier and more efficient process. 
Republican officials like Baxley know 
that their political relevance depends on 
suppressing the generally liberal attitudes 
of college students. 
These politicians are attempting to shut 
those whom they disagree with out of the political process entirely. 
It is time to end these voter suppression 
efforts conducted in the name of nonexis-tent ‘voter fraud.’
It is time to begin to increase the ease of 
access to our democratic process. 
For those who didn’t follow the entire 
story, this law was born out of the election 
for the city of Gainesville’s mayor in 2010. 
That same mayor, Craig Lowe, is up for 
re-election this March. 
What better way to send a strong mes-
sage to Baxley, Jones and their friends by letting our voices be heard in this elec-
tion?

public relations sophomore at UFLetters to the Editor
Election week is here.
When you walk around campus, dozens of people from 
the Swamp Party and the Students Party will try to talk to 
you about Student Government. We know it’s annoying.
We wish we didn’t have to bother you, but SG elections are just 
too important.
Every semester, about $200 of your money goes to SG, assuming 
you take 12 credit hours. 
Do you know how it’s spent? 
Neither do we.  And we don’t know because it’s almost impossible to find out 
where our money goes unless you sit in the SG office and go through 
hundreds of pages of budget documents in binder after binder.
We think it should be much easier for you to see how your mon-
ey is spent in SG. In fact, we think you should have a much bigger 
say in how each dollar of SG’s $18.2 million budget is spent each 
year.  
This Tuesday and Wednesday, you have the opportunity to 
make your voice heard. You have the op-
portunity to make a statement about what you want from SG. You have the opportu-
nity to vote.
We are running for the highest offices 
in SG because we love this university. And 
because we love this university, we care about changing it for the better. So here are our promises to you:  
We promise to fight tuition increases.
We promise to freeze your Activity and Service Fee.We promise to make the budget process fair and transparent.We promise to make it easier for student organizations to re-
ceive funding.
We promise to make campus a safer place for all students.We promise to strive to make UF the most sustainable campus 
in the country.
We promise to bring better food choices to campus.We promise to make transportation by bus, car and bike more 
convenient for students.
We promise to make SG a place where all students are wel-
come.
The other party tends to echo some of our promises. But the dif-
ference between us and them is that they’ve had four years to make good on their promises, and unfortunately for UF students, they haven’t delivered.
Albert Einstein said insanity is doing the same thing over and 
over again and expecting different results.
It’s time for something different in UF SG. It’s time for the Students Party.

Party. Jenna Goldman, Student Body vice president candidate, the 
Students Party. Billy Farrell, Student Body treasurer candidate, the Students Party.Students Party brings 
a different spin to Student GovernmentGuest column
Swamp Party promises a lot of things it 
cannot deliver. 
There are two scenarios:
Either they know this and are lying.Or they don’t know and are not capable of 
governing effectively.
According to its published platform points, the 
Swamp Party wants to simultaneously “decrease all fees for graduate assistants” and provide a “7% increase for student organization budgets for the 2014-2015 fiscal year.” 
Considering graduate students provide about 
$4.7 million to the SG budget, the Swamp Party will have to increase the SG student fees quite a bit if they really expect to cut revenues and increase student organization funding. 
Everybody pays this fee, called the Activity 
and Service Fee, which is currently $16.06/credit hour.
Out of the current $18.2 million budget, only 
about $926,000 went to student organizations and 
about $460,000 went to academic organizations; 
the rest was for overhead and SG events. 
No matter how you spin those numbers, this is 
not representative of students’ interests or fiscally 
responsible.
Student organizations should get more 
funding; after all, it’s “their” money SG spends, 
but the money must come from somewhere.
Christina Bonarrigo, author of the SG 
budget and current Swamp Party Student Body presidential candidate, said during Wednesday’s FLC debate that the Florida governor will invest into UF next year.
That’s how she plans to increase student 
organization funding.
What she doesn’t realize — nor wants you to 
know — is that the governor’s plan to give UF $15 million each year for the next five years is 
to be used for STEM programs and to hire more 
faculty.
The money is certainly not to be diverted to 
the SG budget or student organizations.
The governor has already cut UF’s budget in 
favor of STEM-focused programs to the point that a “shared services model” had to be implemented to share administrative resources between departments and to save money and jobs. 
Ultimately:UF programs were reduced.Graduate assistant funding decreased.People still lost their jobs.
Other pipe dreams pandering to various 
student groups for their votes include building 
“a collegiate veterans memorial to commemorate all Fallen Gators.” 
This would create a “cultural center place in 
the Reitz Union.”Another is developing a 
“Blue Light safety mobile application.” 
As well as a “fitness 
class mobile application.” 
And finally, a “mobile 
application that allows 
students and guests to pay for meters through their phones.”
I am a veteran.And I am truly insulted by this insincere 
attempt to understand what veterans need. 
Instead of the memorial, why not partner 
with the Wounded Warrior Project and other organizations to better reintegrate service members returning from active duty? 
I cannot emphasize how hard it is to come 
back from war.
The exclusion of minorities, obesity, assault, 
rape, binge drinking and drunk driving also won’t be remedied by a cultural center, expensive 
mobile applications or a shuttle service. 
Here’s what SG should do:
Educate students. Break cleavages. 
Build a community.
Technology is not a shortcut to innovation. A room at the Reitz Union is no alternative to 
a program of outreach and education. 
Throwing imaginary money around might get 
the votes of those students not paying attention, but informed students will not fall for cheap tricks.
Good luck getting publishers to agree to make 
less money to “move textbooks into an e-text version to make textbooks cheaper for students.”
And good luck getting “professors teaching 
the same course code [to] work together on teaching the same materials so students can study 
together.”
That will be just as easy as making bars, police 
and Regional Transit System pay their own 
overhead costs.
As well as paying for employee salaries for an 
extra hour so that you can have a “soft closing of bars until 3 a.m.” to try to sober up enough to drive or — hopefully — walk home. 
Whether you’re legal or underage, you are all 
adults.
Act like it.Oh, and one more thing.There already is a “technology that allows 
students to use their laptops, cellphones or tablets as a clicker” in the classroom.
That doesn’t work either.

Johnny Castillo
Almost three years ago, Johnny Castillo 
was handing out fliers for the Unite Party as 
a Sigma Phi Epsilon pledge.
But this week, the 21-year-old political sci-
ence senior is campaigning as the Students Party’s candidate for Student Body presi-dent.
Castillo joined his fraternity as a freshman 
pledge in Fall 2009 and was assigned to be the “little” of current Student Body President Tj Villamil.
Castillo worked his way up to house orga-
nizational representative for the Unite Party. 
But then, he said, there was a turning point.
Castillo said he was present at the Spring 
2011 meeting where the Unite Tapes, which 
exposed how Greek organizations would re-ward members for voting and punish those who didn’t, were secretly recorded and later leaked. He said the meeting discouraged him.
“I saw how Unite was ran and how Stu-
dent Government was ran, and I didn’t like it,” he said.
That Fall, Castillo said the fraternity did a 
national membership review. He was one of 60 brothers who were told they didn’t share the fraternity’s values and were made inac-
tive members the following Spring.
Castillo said he can bring ideas like an ISIS 
waiting list system. He also wants to increase 
campus safety and install more blue lights.
He said he wants to keep tuition from in-
creasing. 
“I know what it’s like to be like most peo-
ple in this university,” Castillo said.
His No. 1 priority, he said, is to reform 
SG into a system not based on legacy but on qualifications.
Interior design junior Arianne Biton, 20, met Castillo in her freshman mathematics class. Biton said his experience as a Sig Ep 
brother makes him understand the issues 
from both Greek and non-Greek sides of the political process.
“The fact that he’s seen both sides makes 
him an unbiased party,” she said.
Jenna Goldman
UF political science sophomore Jenna 
Goldman, 19, is a fourth-generation Gator but a first-time Student Body vice presiden-tial nominee.
During her first week on UF’s campus, Goldman saw there was an open seat for the Jennings Area and was appointed by the Sen-ate in August 2011. But she lost her seat in the Fall 2011 election.
She was involved with Inter-Residence 
Hall Association her freshman year and 
served on Jennings Area Government. She 
is an active member of Pride Student Union and the Women’s Student Association.
Goldman currently serves as the Students 
Party president, a co-chair of College Demo-crats Women’s Caucus and as a residential assistant in Jennings Hall.
Goldman said she is qualified to serve 
as vice president because of her experience 
with outside organizations. She said these 
organizations do similar things but more ef-ficiently.“Cabinet has the ability to do so much, 
and I see that from the outside,” she said.
If elected vice president, Goldman said 
she would push for more on-campus secu-rity measures like more Student Nighttime Auxiliary Patrol vans.
Chloe Hale, a 19-year-old biology and 
health education sophomore, met Goldman at an RA training session in August. Hale said Goldman’s experience as an RA quali-fies her for the position of vice president.
“She really wants to progress this univer -
sity in a positive manner,” she said.
Billy Farrell
Like the other 50,000 students at UF, Billy 
Farrell pays into the university and wants to know how his fees are being spent.
Farrell, a 21-year-old environmental sci-
ence junior, said he chose to run as treasurer because of its role in allocations.
“We also want to increase the value of a 
UF degree,” he said.
Farrell is the president of College Demo-
crats. He has worked with Gators for Obama, Children Beyond Our Borders, Pride Student Union and has attended Gatorship.
Farrell said he became involved with stu-
dent politics when he saw the cost of tuition rise in 2012. He slated with the Students Party Spring 2012 for an agriculture seat and in Fall 2012 for a District C seat but lost both times.
As treasurer, Farrell said he wants to pro-
mote ideas of transparency and accessibility by installing a live update system on the SG website so students have access to all finan-cial information. He said he also wants to cut down on SG’s executive perks.
Lauren Nickolof, a 19-year-old politi-
cal science and economics sophomore who serves under Farrell as the College Demo-
crats director of outreach, became friends 
with him instantly.
“He’s very good at taking ideas he gets 
from people and putting them together,” she said.8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 2013

Christina Bonarrigo
Christina Bonarrigo wasted no time getting 
involved with SG in her college career.
The 22-year-old political science senior 
hopes to bring four years worth of experience 
to a climactic close as the Swamp Party’s can-didate for Student Body president.
Bonarrigo, who is currently the Student 
Senate president, has represented District A for four years. During her time in the Senate, she was a member of the judiciary and bud-get committees and became the Budget and Appropriations Committee chairwoman last year.
Her accomplishments include extend-
ing SNAP’s hours, working with the City of Gainesville to install more lighting fixtures with energy-efficient lightbulbs and imple-menting more Regional Transit System bus routes.
Bonarrigo is a Zeta Tau Alpha sister. She 
has served on the Title IX Committee, web services advisory, bookstore committee, trans-portation and access fee committee, local fee committee, the technology fee committee and Capital Improvement Trust Fund.
Bonarrigo is the founder of the Swamp 
Party. She believes the executive office needs a personal, female touch.
“I’ve always wanted to be an inspiration 
for women — especially on this campus,” she said.
Public relations and business management 
senior Dara Schopp, 21, met Bonarrigo her freshman year.
“She’s worked her ass off for so long,” 
Schopp said. “I don’t think there’s a better per -
son for the job.”
Joselyn Rivas
Joselyn Rivas was vice president of her 
high school for two years. She’s trying to con-tinue that tradition here at UF.
Rivas, a 20-year-old finance and psychol-
ogy junior, is running for Student Body vice president on the Swamp Party’s ticket. She said SG cabinet, which the vice president over -
sees, is a good fit for her.
Rivas became involved her sophomore 
year at UF as the Multicultural Affairs Cabi-net director. In Fall 2012, she became the  
Diversity Division chair of SG cabinet.
As vice president, Rivas said she would 
bridge the gap between SG and the Student Body.
“It’s good to be proud of where you came 
from and to celebrate other people’s heritage,” she said.
Rivas is also involved with the Young 
Leaders Conference, Inter-Residence Hall As-sociation and her sorority , Gamma Eta. Rivas said she was proud to be running with Bonar -
rigo on the first all-female executive ticket.
Family, youth and community sciences se-
nior Jennifer Rodriguez, 21, was in the same pledge class as Rivas. 
“Just living with her I’ve seen how hard 
she puts her effort in,” she said. “I think it’s phenomenal because Lord knows I couldn’t do it.”Jayce Victor
Jayce Victor transferred to UF from Va-
lencia College two years ago because his best friend was a Gator.
Two years later, the 22-year-old philosophy 
senior is Swamp Party’s candidate for Student Body treasurer.
Victor said he is running because of the 
lack of transparency and fiscal responsibility in SG. As treasurer, Victor said he would in-crease student fees to enhance the student ex-perience. Victor said he would sponsor more training for student organizations looking to get in the SG budget cycle.
Victor is the president and founder of the 
Black Law Students Association at UF. He

Zack Powers got his mojo back on Sun-
day.
The sophomore first baseman hit two 
grand slams and tallied nine RBI in No. 17 
Florida’s (2-1) 16-5 win against Duke (1-2), clinching the season-opening series at McKethan Stadium.
“To have a game like this is real spe-
cial,” Powers said.
With the Gators leading 6-3 in the 
seventh inning, second baseman Casey Turgeon walked, and pinch hitter Kevin 
Stypulkowski and right fielder Vickash 
Ramjit both were hit by pitches to load the bases for Powers.
On a 2-2 count, Powers hit a line-drive 
grand slam over the right field wall off Blue Devils right-hander Ryan Munger. Powers’ first career home run gave the Gators a 10-3 lead.
“I was just trying to get a base hit,” 
Powers said of his first grand slam. “Help out the team, get another RBI. The second time, I kind of got greedy.”

Another ranked Southeastern Confer -
ence foe, another missed opportunity for 
coach Amanda Butler and the Gators.
Three days after coming up short in 
a 78-71 loss to Texas A&M on the road, Florida again wasted a chance to earn 
a signature victory , dropping a critical conference matchup with No. 13 Geor -
gia in the O’Connell Center. 
Led by senior forward Jasmine Has-
sell, the Bulldogs escaped the Gators’ 
upset bid in a 62-57 victory on Sunday. 
The loss drops UF (15-11, 4-8 SEC) to 
just 2-6 in its past eight games. 
“It’s very frustrating because it feels 
like the things that are in our control, we 
are not controlling,” Butler said. “As fun-
damental as an individual’s energy level 
or focus and how hard they are listening to what we are trying to do. Little things 
like that become game-changers.” 
Said senior Jennifer George: “We 
have the potential, this team, to be really good.”But potential has not translated into 
victories. Florida is 0-6 against ranked opponents during conference play . Five 
of those losses have come by eight points or fewer in what has become an increas-
ingly frustrating season for the Gators.
Butler’s team has been unable to take 
the next step in its development and will likely miss the NCAA Tournament be-
cause of it. 
“We’re a 
young team, and we are learning the 
lessons the 
hard way, un-
fortunately ,” Butler said. 
Hassell scored 16 points and pulled 
down 16 rebounds for the Bulldogs (21-4, 9-3 SEC), who overcame 36.7 percent 
shooting from the floor to earn their first 
victory in Gainesville since Jan. 24, 2008. 
George, Hassell’s counterpart in the 
paint, scored 13 of her game-high 17 points in the second half to keep Florida within striking distance. UF loses to Georgia at homeMen’s BAsketBAll

Before Saturday’s game, Kenny Boyn-
ton remembered what happened at Auburn 
Arena two seasons ago. 
During an ugly 45-40 win against the 
Tigers on Jan. 20, 2011, the Gators shot a dismal 28.3 percent and went 5 of 26 from beyond the arc. Boynton had a rough game, scoring nine points on 3-of-13 shooting and going 2 of 9 from three-point range. 
“We thought about it,” Boynton said. 
“We knew the game could be as close as it was two years ago.” 
Thanks to hot outside shooting, the 
Gators had Saturday afternoon’s contest practically wrapped up by halftime. 
No. 7 Florida (21-3, 11-1 Southeastern 
Conference) buried a season-best 15 three-pointers on 30 attempts in its 83-52 road vic-tory against Auburn. 
“We couldn’t get nothing to fall two 
years ago, but [Saturday] everyone was on,” Boynton said. “All of us did a great job of knocking down shots.”
Behind junior point guard Scottie Wil-
bekin’s 10 assists, the Gators tallied a sea-son-best 25 assists and had success finding the open man on the perimeter. 
Twelve of the Gators’ 15 made three-
point field goals came in catch-and-shoot situations. Nine were uncontested.
Florida did not shy away from taking 
threes, attempting more than half of its field goals from the perimeter. During their past five games, the Gators have heaved 44.4 per -
cent of its shots from three-point range. 
As long as his players take good looks, 
the high percentage doesn’t bother coach Billy Donovan.
“Who scores is just a guy being in the 
right spot at the right time,” Donovan said. “We’re just going to take the extra pass and move and share it.”
Boynton passed Andrew DeClercq on 
Saturday as Florida’s all-time leader with 129 starts, and the senior guard pieced to-gether an impressive shooting performance.

the Gators’ most important victory of the season?44% Yes

45 total votesFreshman forward Christin 
Mercer connected on a field 
goal to pull the Gators within 
one at 52-51. But on the next possession, Georgia senior for -
ward Anne Marie Armstrong connected on a three-point at-tempt with 3:03 remaining to 
help quell Florida’s second-half 
comeback. 
A three-pointer from junior 
guard Khaalidah Miller gave Georgia a 60-55 lead with 39 seconds remaining to secure 
the victory.
“It was obviously a battle,” 
UGA coach Andy Landers said. “I was really proud of our team. 
… It wasn’t design. It wasn’t scouting report. They made 
plays.”
The Gators controlled much 
of the first half, flustering the Bulldogs into 11 turnovers with 
pressure defense. Landers was forced to use multiple timeouts 
to limit the damage and com-
pose his team.
“I think we had like four turnovers in the first 5 or 6 min-utes of the basketball game,” Landers said. “Unforced errors. 
Just carelessness.”
Florida took a 24-12 lead on 
a jumper by freshman guard Sydney Moss with 8:18 remain-
ing in the first half, but Georgia responded.
Using a 12-0 run during a 
6 - m i n u t e span, the 
B u l l d o g s 
entered half-time with a 
30-28 lead.
The loss 
is Florida’s second to 
Georgia this 
season. The Gators lost 69-52 in 
Athens, Ga., on Jan. 27. 
Sunday, though more com-
pelling, was equally frustrating for Butler.
“Certainly , we failed today . 
There is not any question,” But-ler said.
“But most of the time the 
greatest lessons are learned in the face of failure.”

Kenny Boynton attempts a shot during Florida’s 69-52 victory 
against Kentucky on Feb. 12 at the O’Connell Center.
Senior guard scored 16 points in victory
behind the arc to score 16 points. All of his 
threes came on the wing.
Freshman guard Michael Frazier II led 
the Gators’ three-point barrage, drilling 6 of his 7 three-point attempts to record a career-best 18 points. 
Four of Frazier’s threes came in the 
second half. Utilizing backdoor cuts and screens, he found himself uncontested on all but one three-point attempt.  
Mike Rosario contributed to UF’s 
three-point barrage but found more suc-cess attacking the basket. The redshirt senior guard went 2 of 6 from beyond the arc but finished with a game-high 22 points on 9-of-14 shooting.
Rosario and Boynton combined for 
four of Florida’s seven threes in the first half and helped the Gators end the first 20 minutes on a 17-5 run to take a 47-22 lead at halftime. 
Senior forward Erik Murphy, the SEC’s 
leading three-point shooter at 50 percent, made 3 of 4 threes Saturday for 11 points. 
The undersized Tigers (9-16, 3-9 SEC) 
converged inside the paint for much of the contest, trying to contain 6-foot-9, 249-pound center Patric Young.
While the Tigers held Young to just 
two points and three rebounds, they often ignored the perimeter. 
“They doubled [Young],” Donovan 
said. “They did some things when he got the ball. They were very, very aggressive. When the ball came out of the post … we got extra movement.”HoopS , from page 13

What Florida accomplished on Satur -
day evening had not been done in nearly 
21 years.
The top-ranked Gators traveled to Ath-
ens, Ga., and became the first No. 1 team to top the Bulldogs in Stegeman Coliseum since 1992.
No. 1 Florida (6-1, 5-1 Southeastern 
Conference) overcame an early deficit against No. 9 Georgia (5-5-1, 3-1-1 SEC) in a 197.3-196.175 victory in front of 9,971, to extend its winning streak to five.
The Gators appeared unable to over -
come the Bulldogs’ 49.55 vault mark early as it trailed by 0.15 midway through the meet.But with help from two Georgia falls, 
Florida climbed out of the hole to string together scores of 49.15 and 49.3 on floor 
and balance beam to capture its second 
road win of 2013.
UF’s uneven bars rotation produced its 
lowest showing since posting a 49.25 dur -
ing a 196.875-196.575 loss against LSU on 
Jan. 11 in Baton Rouge, La. 
Although the Gators fell short of their 
season average (49.421), it was enough to 
get the victory. 
 “What I loved is that they did not buck-
le after the opening two events where we felt we did not perform as we are capable of,” Faehn said.
Florida pieced together its fourth-high-
est total of the season, while winning only one individual event. Freshman Bridget Sloan competed in 
her fourth consecutive all-around and earned her third victory with a score of 
39.6. 
For the second con-
secutive season, a Florida 
freshman has claimed three consecutive all-
around event victories.
Sophomore Kytra 
Hunter accomplished the 
feat during the 2012 cam-
paign. 
Last week, Sloan became the only fresh-
man this season to earn the SEC Gymnast 
of the Week honor.
She pinned scores of 9.925 and 9.95 on 
vault and bars, respectively, against the Bulldogs.“There was a little bit of barking go-
ing on, but I think that is what fueled us,” Sloan said.
“We definitely fed off of it and I think 
that is why we had such a great road team score.”
Three of Florida’s next six dual meets 
will take place away from home or in a 
neutral gym as it nears the end of the sea-
son.
UF has found success on the road as of 
late with Saturday’s win against Georgia 
and a 196.575-196.175 victory against Ar -
kansas on Feb. 1 in Fayetteville, Ark. 
“They are grasping all the intangibles 
now — the heart, the fight, the passion,” 
Faehn said.
“The fight was most important tonight. 
I was proud of them.”Florida freshman earns third all-around title in victory
Powers becomes second Gator to hit two grand slams in one game
inning as he took Munger deep again to right field with the bases loaded to put Florida up 16-5. Powers joined Preston Tucker as the only Florida player to connect on 
two grand slams in the same game. Tucker accomplished 
the feat on April 8, 2009, in a 16-3 win against UCF.
“I’m just happy for him in general,” O’Sullivan said 
of Powers. “I’m just pleased that he’s healthy, and he’s contributing like we always knew he could.”
Powers, who missed the entire 2012 season after un-
dergoing surgery to repair a torn labrum, knocked two more homers on Sunday than he did during his entire freshman season when he was named to the Southeastern Conference’s All-Freshman Team.
“That was awesome,” center fielder Cody Dent said. “I 
was hoping he was going to do it, and I was very happy 
for him when he did.”
Powers nearly had three grand 
slams in the game. 
Down 3-2 entering the bottom 
of the sixth, 11 straight Gators had 
been retired by Blue Devils since the 
Gators’ last hit — a Dent double in the second innings — when Casey Turgeon led off with a single to right field. 
Shafer followed Turgeon with a single up the middle 
and Vickash Ramjit loaded the bases two at-bats later with an infield single.
Powers followed Ramjit with a sac fly to center field to tie the game. 
“I did think I got all of that one,” Powers said. “But, I 
mean it’s great just to get an RBI out of it.
In Friday’s 4-3 loss and Saturday’s 4-2 win, the Gators 
had 12 hits combined. With Powers starting at first, they had 13.
O’Sullivan said that he will give Powers a shot in the 
outfield if it means getting his bat in the lineup on a regu-lar basis.
Since he’s been at Florida, Powers has only played 
third and first base. But as long as he is in the lineup, Pow-
ers is satisfied.
“Wherever the coaches want me to hit in the lineup,” 
Powers said. “It doesn’t matter to me.”

The first five games the Gators 
played in the Florida Lipton Invi-
tational were ordinary. The Florida offense and pitching staff dominat-ed the competition, and UF picked 
up five easy victories. However, the 
last game of the tourney took a dif-ferent course.
For the first five innings of the 
Gators’ game against Charleston Southern on Sunday, starting pitch-ers Hannah Rogers and Jennifer Giles kept the game scoreless. 
After allowing a run in the top of 
the sixth inning to break the tie, Rog-ers let a chance to escape the inning relatively unscathed slip away.
With runners on second and 
third and two outs, Charleston Southern catcher Melanie Stickney hit a soft groundball to Rogers. 
Rogers misplayed the ball, and it 
sputtered under her glove. Short-stop Katie Medina tried to throw the runner out, but her throw sailed past the first baseman Lauren Hae-ger’s glove. When the mayhem ended, the Gators trailed 3-0.
“A bad, in-between hop in and 
around Hannah’s glove, then Katie 
sidearm throws it, and then we had 
a bad stretch at first base,” coach Tim Walton said. “In all essence, it was probably three mistakes all in one play.”
But the game soon became much 
stranger.
In the bottom half of the inning, 
Lauren Haeger drew a walk and Kelsey Horton followed with a sin-gle. Taylor Schwarz pinch ran for Haeger, and Briana Little came in to hit for Ensley Gammel. Little’s at-bat proved crucial despite not even taking the bat off her shoulder.During Little’s at-bat, third-base 
umpire Mike Finch noticed a hop in Giles’ delivery. Finch called Giles for 
an illegal pitch, advancing Schwarz 
to third and Horton to second. 
On a 3-0 count, Giles hit Little 
with a pitch. Normally, this would load the bases, but Finch signaled a second illegal pitch, scoring Schwarz and moving Horton to third.
With CSU coach Shane Winkler 
arguing the call, Giles stepped back into the circle to face pinch hitter Taylore Fuller. For the third time in the inning, Giles was called for 
an illegal pitch. Schwarz crossed 
home, and the momentum swung 
in Florida’s favor.
“We noticed that she was illegal 
the whole game,” Haeger said. “I 
don’t know how it was brought to [Finch’s] attention, but I’m glad it was.”
The two runs on illegal pitches set the stage for Haeger to come up big for Florida in the seventh in-ning.
After Rogers pitched a scoreless 
seventh, the Gators had the top of 
the lineup due to hit in the bottom 
half of the inning.
Freshman Kelsey Stewart led off 
the inning with a one-pitch ground-out to the pitcher. Third baseman Stephanie Tofft followed Stewart with a one-pitch groundout of her own.
Haeger stepped into the bat-
ter’s box. After taking one pitch for a ball, she launched a high fly ball that cleared the wall in right center.
“My job is not just to get on base; 
my job is to hit a home run in that situation,” Haeger said.
Bailey Castro came up next, and 
she flew out. But with a tiebreaker rule in effect, the Gators came to bat in the eighth inning with Castro on second base.
Horton bunted Castro over to 
third, bringing up center fielder Jessica Damico, who started for an injured Kirsti Merritt. 
On a 3-1 count, Damico lofted 
a fly ball to deep center, which was misplayed by Charleston Southern’s Courtney Konyk. The ball dropped in, scoring Castro as Damico reached third with a game-winning triple.
“We grew from having our backs 
against the wall with the last out of 
the last inning of the game to lose 
the game, and then finding a way to hold them,” Walton said.
“Then we grew again with the 
perfect execution from two bat-ters.”MONDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 2013 � ALLIGATOR,  15

A streaky second half got the job done for the Gators.
Leading 6-3, Florida grabbed five consecutive draw 
controls to begin the second half, four of which were a 
product of sophomore Shannon Gilroy. 
Though High Point scored the first goal in the sec-
ond half to bring the score to 6-4, UF’s domination of the 
draws led to a 7-0 run.
The No. 3 Gators (3-0) took down the Panthers (1-1) 
13-7 on Sunday afternoon in High Point, N.C. The win gives Florida its first 3-0 start in program history.
“Obviously, you want to have three wins rather than 
three losses,” coach Amanda O’Leary said. “It’s a huge 
momentum push.”Gilroy tied a career-high tally with seven draw con-
trols, leading UF and outnumbering High Point’s six. She 
accomplished the feat twice last season in wins against William & Mary and Penn State.
“I’ve been doing it for so long now 
that I’m able to do things differently when I’m up against different opponents on the draw,” Gilroy said. “Height is 
definitely a huge advantage for me, so 
I’m strong enough where I can pull it to 
myself or to my teammates.”
Overall, the Gators ousted the Pan-
thers in draw controls 16-6 in the match. 
Florida tallied 17 total between its victories against North 
Carolina and Jacksonville.
“I think Shannon did a great job on the draws,” O’Leary said. “Being able to control the ball and being in posses-
sion of it certainly puts us at an advantage.”
Senior Caroline Chesterman and Gilroy led Florida 
with three goals each, both scoring twice during the 7-0 stretch. 
Sophomore Nicole Graziano and senior Kitty Cullen 
wrapped up the game with two goals each while senior Brittany Dashiell led the team with two assists.
The Gators produced 32 shots in the game while only 
capitalizing on 13 of them, increasing their shot percent-age to .398 on the season.
“Generating so many shots is a positive,” O’Leary 
said.
“But I think [assistant coach Erica LaGrow] would like 
them to convert about 50 percent or higher. So I don’t think we are there just yet.”UF dominates draw controls in victory against High Point

After Olivia Janowicz and Danielle Col-
lins dropped the first doubles match to 
Duke’s Monica Turewicz and Hanna Mar 
8-4, Florida could not get back on track.
The No. 2 Gators dropped their first 
dual meet match of the season in a 4-0 loss 
against the Blue Devils in Durham, N.C., 
on Sunday. The defeat was UF’s first in 
more than a year.Lauren Embree and Sofie Oyen held 
strong in opposition, defeating Duke’s 
Mary Clayton and Ester Goldfeld 8-4.
But the duo’s win 
was overlooked as Al-exandra Cercone and 
Brianna Morgan dropped their match. 
Cercone and Morgan faced an 8-8 tie in 
the final set. But they fell behind in the tie-breaker 7-3 and lost 9-8 to Duke’s Annie Mullholland and Marianne Jodoin. Florida failed to step up the pace in sin-
gles. The Gators suffered three losses and trailed in four other matches that were not finished due to the Blue Devils’ clinching. 
Collins and Oyen dropped their match-
es 6-4, 7-5 to Duke’s Monica Turewicz and Ester Goldfeld, respectively.
Janowicz stuck through three sets. Af-
ter taking the first set, Janowicz dropped the final two to lose.
Embree, Cercone and Morgan were still 
mid-match when Duke clinched the vic-tory and did not finish.
“Duke was the better team at the end 
of sets,” coach Roland Thornqvist said. “They played with great passion and had a great crowd. I thought they were the bet-ter team today.”
The Gators will now focus on regroup-
ing from their first road loss as they head to Raleigh, N.C. today to face No. 1 North Carolina.
“Our job now is to forget it and play 
again [today] at a high level,” Thornqvist said.
“Even though we lost this one, this trip 
is exactly what we need.”Blue Devils snap Gators’ 25-match winning streak Gilroy
“In all essence, it was 
probably three mistakes all 
in one play.”

After Sunday’s game ended, 
clay dotted the right side of Cody 
Dent’s uniform from his chest to 
his cleats.
His Oakley glasses shined in 
the afternoon sun. He smiled as 
he gestured to his family in the 
stands.
Dent had a weekend worth 
smiling about.
He saved his best game for 
last. 
Dent picked up his sixth career 
multi-hit game in Florida’s sea-
son-opening series finale against Duke on Sunday at McKethan 
Stadium.
He stroked a hanging cur -
veball from Blue Devils starter 
James Marvel over right fielder Jeff Kremer’s head during the 
second inning.
The Boynton Beach native fol-
lowed his second career double 
by singling home Josh Tobias 
four frames later.
Dent crossed home plate him-
self in Sunday’s game, scoring 
on an RBI single from Kevin Sty-pulkowski in the bottom of the 
eighth.
The stats read 3 for 8 with two 
RBI and a run in three games 
from his familiar ninth spot. Dent 
led all starters with a .375 aver -
age.
Blue Devils coach Chris Pol-
lard even brought in lefty spe-cialist Remy Janco on Saturday 
to face Dent during the fourth inning.
“He had a great weekend,” 
coach Kevin O’Sullivan said. “He’s earned the opportunity to move up. I thought about moving him up yesterday and today, but 
he’s been swinging the bat really 
good. I didn’t want to disrupt the lineup very much, but I’m really pleased with how he swung the 
bat this weekend.”
Finding success at the plate 
has been rough for Dent. He had 
a career .180 average during his first three seasons as a Gator.
But a swing adjustment in the 
summer helped him.  
Former Major Leaguer Bucky 
Dent, Cody’s father, said the se-nior should use a leg kick during 
his swing. Cody went to work, 
and the Florida coaching staff ap-proved.
So far, so good.
“It has helped with my timing 
a lot more,” Dent said.
“I get timed up for a fastball, 
and I won’t swing at a breaking ball until two strikes. I was get-
ting stopped. My rhythm was getting interrupted (last year).”
His bat isn’t the only changed 
aspect of his game.
With Daniel Pigott playing 
professional baseball and Tyler Thompson foregoing his senior 
season for personal reasons, the 
Gators needed a center fielder.
Dent backed up Tobias at third 
last season. He made just one start in center in 2012 and never played outfield until arriving at Florida.
Despite his inexperience, Dent 
didn’t make an error in 10 chanc-
es during the weekend.
Dent didn’t show any nerves 
in the field or at the plate.
Dent went 1 for 3 with runners 
in scoring position during the 
weekend series.
“We know he can swing the bat,” Zack Powers said. “He swung the bat good during the fall and the spring. He’s going to come out here and show it. He works hard.
“He’s definitely one of the 
hardest workers on the team. He’s been the same hard worker since I’ve seen him. It’s finally 
paying off.”
