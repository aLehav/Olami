 Alligator        Thursday, July 26, 2012
On Feb. 1, 1973, the Alligator was cut from the UF campus 
and became the Independent Florida Alligator, after conflict 
surrounding the 1971 distribution of the abortion fliers. In 1912 Florida Alligator became 
UF’s official student newspaper. A year 
later it published photographs for the 
first time, and a summer edition was 
added in 1915.
During the Great Depression, the 
Alligator published an annual “Gripe and 
Grievance Edition,” in which students could 
complain about campus problems. UF, 
which owned the paper at the time, fretted 
over possible lawsuits and warned editors 
they could be fined for libelous remarks. The Florida 
Alligator became a daily 
newspaper in 1963. On Nov. 22, 1963, the same day President 
Kennedy was assassinated, then Alligator editor 
David Lawrence published an editorial condemn-
ing the Board of Student Publications for hiring 
the sports editor as the next Alligator editor in-
stead of the managing editor. Lawrence was fired.
In 1966, the Board of Student Publi-
cations fired three Alligator editors, listing 
“constant and unprofessional harass-
ment of Student Government officials and 
friends of the University of Florida” among 
the reasons for the firings. Four Alligator editors 
quit over a dispute involving 
tenure for an outspoken 
liberal professor in 1968.In 1971, Alligator editor Ron Sachs ran fliers listing abortion referral 
services with his story in the Alligator, earning national attention for 
breaking the Florida Statute prohibiting dissemination of abortion 
information, and defying the opposition of President O’Connell.
O’Connell was determined to 
bring the Alligator under administra-
tion control. For the Alligator staff, 
independence meant the university 
had no control over content or hiring 
decisions, but  $94,000 in annual 
student fees would evaporate.In 1978, Barry Klein became 
the first Alligator reporter to be 
arrested for doing his job. He was 
booked and fingerprinted by po-
lice for trespassing at a UF admin-
istration meeting, a meeting that 
is open to the public according to 
the Florida Sunshine Law. In 1984 the Alligator sued UF to gain access 
to correspondence between the university and the 
NCAA regarding rule violations.
 The Alligator won access 
to University Police records of 
crime victims on UF’s campus 
in 1986.

A signature orange news rack holding copies of The Independent Florida Alligator stands next to university-owned modular racks at 
Weimer Hall, which houses the College of Journalism and Communications.
In my time as a student leader at UF, 
I saw first hand how critical it is for the student body to have a dedicat-
ed student newspaper. 
In this era of budget cuts and tuition 
increases, it is vital that the student body remain informed and engaged. 
While I have at times taken issue 
with the Alligator, it has done a tre-mendous service to the student body and should be permitted to continue unabated.
I have no doubt that the administra-
tion’s push towards modular units is in good faith, having discussed it with many administrators at the project’s in-ception. 
However, I disagree with the current 
approach as I believe the Alligator is unique and must be treated singularly from the other newspapers which will occupy the modular units. 
Many of these other newspapers are 
nationally circulated, with no specific focus on our university. Others are not regularly printed. 
The Alligator is the only daily news-
paper focused solely on the UF Student Body.
The licensing fee to be placed on the 
Alligator is particularly troublesome. The Alligator is free for every student and thus consistently has difficulty getting out of the red. 
I would speculate that such a fee 
would be a major burden on the paper, which is completely student produced, in a way that would not affect heavy-weights such as the New York Times or USA Today or even the Gainesville Sun. 
In addition, the modular units will 
not be placed nearly as ubiquitously as 
the Alligator’s orange racks are currently. 
This would reduce 
student access to the student newspaper, something I believe most students would object to.
The Alligator has 
been a treasure of our Student Body since the time my grandfather attended UF. 
I believe every consideration must 
be made to ensure the Alligator remains a student-run student newspaper that is accessible to every student and able to remain financially afloat. 
I stand for “saving the racks.”

Former Student Body PresidentFormer Student Body President 
supports saving the racks, keeping a ‘treasure’ of UF Student Body  UNIVERSITYAlligator staff addresses UF president’s response to council’s request to reconsider
Dear Anne and Journalism Department Advisory 
Council,
Thank you for taking the time to write to me 
about the Independent Florida Alligator.
First, let me say that we appreciate the Alligator and want 
it to succeed.  It is an excellent news source for our students and training ground for those studying journalism.  Even in this time of major budget reductions, we have continued our long-standing support of the paper through regular ad-vertising, which currently totals nearly $28,000 a year.  
Our goal in moving toward modular newspaper racks 
is to enhance safety and aesthetics.  When we started this initiative, there were 407 newspaper racks on campus con-taining 26 different publications.  During hurricane season, these racks pose a serious hazard.  It is not uncommon to remove racks from city streets as a storm approaches. By installing modular racks, the university will not be faced with the time-consuming task of monitoring which publish-ers have picked up their racks and which haven’t, thereby requiring university personnel to remove the potential pro-jectiles.  The new racks are also more attractive and are less visually intrusive in the historic part of campus where they have been installed.
When we started this process in 2010, all 20 of the pub-
lishers except the Alligator agreed to make the switch. That includes other free publications.  In response to the Alliga-tor’s concerns, we have met repeatedly with them and have delayed the full implementation of the conversion to the 
modular units by almost three years.  We 
have also made changes in our plans.  For example, when the Alligator’s repre-sentatives said they were concerned stu-dents wouldn’t know to look for the Al-ligator in the modular units, we offered to let them put the Alligator’s distinctive logo and orange color on the modular units.
You should also know that we are not 
seeking to replace all of the Alligator’s racks.  Half of their inventory of racks on campus — approximately 40  — will 
remain where they are.
Thank you for writing. I hope this answers some of your 
questions and concerns.
 Bernie
In a response to a letter from the Journalism Depart-
ment Advisory Council, UF President Bernie Ma-chen made a few claims about the current situation 
with the Alligator’s orange racks that deserve clarifica-tion.
President Machen’s letter can be read  to the left. 
Here is our response to his claims:
� University advertising has dropped over the 
years.
� Machen’s letter implies that we have not offered to 
comply with whatever  standards are necessary to 
secure our racks. We have offered to secure or weigh down our racks before a storm.  
� He argues that during hurricane season, university 
personnel are faced with the daunting and time-con-suming task of removing these racks for safety reasons. We have offered to remove the racks ourselves. 
� He fails to mention that not all the other publica-
tions on campus have received the licensing agreement sent to the Alligator. 
� He argues that the orange racks are “visually intru-
sive in the historic part of campus.” These racks have been on campus for decades, are well-maintaned and display the school’s colors. How are they not an historic icon for UF’s campus? 
� Eighty-two percent of our papers are delivered in 
this historic district.  
� While it is true that after Aug. 15, we will have 
close to 40 racks remaining on campus, if the univer -
sity moves ahead with its future removal plans, we will have only 30 left. Most of the Alligator racks the univer -
sity demands be removed are in high-traffic areas. 
� The logo the university offered to allow in the mod-
ular racks is thinner than the average bumper sticker.
Frankly, President Machen’s response fails to an-
swer the question of why the university feels so ada-mant about removing the racks.

This column appeared Friday in The Miami Herald.
Sometimes, the threats to media freedoms aren’t blatant and up front, but they’re no less dangerous.
They take the guise of regulation, behind-the-scenes intimida-
tion, and in the latest case in our state, in a housekeeping directive by the administration of the University of Florida that the signature orange newspaper racks carrying The Independent Florida Alligator on campus be removed.
The Alligator’s dedicated racks, accented by blue-lettered adhesives 
with the newspaper’s name, have been as much a part of campus life in Gator Nation as the brick buildings.
The storied newspaper founded in 1906 and housed on and off campus 
through various incarnations became independent in 1973, after years of attempts by the UF administration to censor its content.
It is widely respected as a practicum for student journalists who cover 
UF life and the city of Gainesville, and often wins top national awards.
It is inconceivable that a university that houses one of the top journal-ism programs in the nation would want to curtail students’ easy access to the student-run newspaper.
But after a century of the paper’s circulating freely on campus — the last 
30 years in the distinctive orange racks — the administration now finds the racks aesthetically offensive and unsafe, and has demanded The Alligator remove them by Aug. 15.
“The racks are our branding,” says Ed Barber, president emeritus of 
the newspaper and executive director of the Alligator Alumni Association. “We have to grab people’s attention and say, ‘Here we are.’ ”
The laughable range of reasons cited for their removal — that students 
might trip over them (not even in my time at UF, when the legal drinking age was 18 and alcohol was widely consumed on campus, was this an is-sue) and that they could become projectiles in a storm (as if there haven’t been storms before in Florida the past three decades and no chains strong enough at Home Depot to secure racks) — are suspect.
As is the proposed alternative: UF wants to replace the current visible 
racks with bland, modular black racks for which the university would charge a fee to The Alligator and other publications that would rotate us-ing them.
What is really behind this attempt to undermine the student newspaper 
and tax what is essentially a public service?
Is it a crass attempt to collect more fees, or something larger and more 
sinister and apt to the times?
Those of us familiar with the shenanigans of governance and campus 
affairs (I wrote for the Alligator during the late ’70s) know that history indicates that the real cause for annoyance to the powers that be is student-journalist scrutiny.
This isn’t a safety issue, and certainly UF’s orange-and-blue colors 
aren’t suddenly out of fashion in campus decor.
It’s at best a display of insensitivity to the value of a newspaper that 
shouldn’t be treated like a giveaway shopper.
Special interests would like nothing more than to weaken the media.But a university’s administration and board of trustees should take po-
sitions that strengthen democracy, not erode it, even if it’s only by a count of 19 orange newspaper racks.

Police arrested another suspect Monday afternoon as 
part of an undercover Internet sex sting that has led to 
the arrests of six other suspects.
Raymond E. Wortham, 38, of Archer, was arrested 
just before 5:30 p.m. Monday and charged with two counts of obscene communication and one count of using a two-way communication device to facilitate a felony.
Operation Tailspin was a collaborative sexual preda-
tor operation between the Alachua County Sheriff’s Of-ﬁ  ce and the Alachua and Gainesville police departments that ended Monday.
Starting on July 18, detectives, posing as 12- to 14-
year-old children, spent ﬁ  ve days talking to the sexual predators, luring them to designated locations and ar-resting them.
According to the ASO arrest report, Wortham be-
lieved he was talking with a 14-year-old girl and her boyfriend after responding to an online advertisement.Police arrest

The Student Senate agenda be-
gan with three resolutions up for 
vote at Tuesday’s meeting, but Sen. Umair Asghar removed his reso-lution regarding independently owned newspaper racks when the meeting started.The resolution asked the UF ad-
ministration to halt the removal of all independently owned newspa-per racks until retired economics professor David Denslow ﬁ  nished an impact study.
Asghar said he wrote the reso-
lution hastily after the story broke last week. He said he wants to pull the current resolution and rewrite it for Tuesday’s 
meeting.
After the 
meeting, Asghar said he wants to have this week to gather more input.
“I didn’t do 
enough research,” he said.He said he wants the new reso-
lution to be perfect and will submit it again to the Judiciary Commit-tee.
The Judiciary Committee unfa-
vorably passed the ﬁ  rst resolution 3-1, with Asghar as the dissenting vote at their meeting Sunday.
“I was appalled that the Judi-
ciary Committee found it to be un-favorable,” he said.
The other two resolutions were 
honoring Rebecca “Becca” Harris, a UF student who died in a hit-and-run accident, and Wayne Wal-lace, former director of the Career Resource Center.

� THE NEW FACILITY WILL COST $50 MILLION. 
JAVIER EDWARDS
Alligator Contributing Writer
The facility for the Gainesville Regional Transit System can 
support a maximum of about 70 buses. 
It now accommodates 113 buses.
“It’s bursting at its seams,” said Chip Skinner, marketing and communications supervisor at RTS.
Skinner said the federal government said it will no longer 
provide federal funding to RTS to expand its ﬂ  eet because the facility is over its maximum holding capacity.
“If we plan to provide the community with more service, 
we’re going to need more buses,” he said.
The City of Gainesville will construct a two-story, 125,000-
square-foot facility as the new headquarters for RTS.
The complex will be about four times the size of the current 
facility , which was built more than four decades ago, Skinner said.
The new facility will provide major beneﬁ  ts for the whole 
city, said Theresa “T” Harrison, marketing and communica-tions specialist for Gainesville RTS. Services would be able to expand deeper into Alachua County. She said the more service and the more buses, the more staff and support RTS is going to need.
The $50 million facility will be located three blocks south of 
the current facility, located at 100 SE 10th Ave.
Skinner said the facility should be done sometime in 2015.City of Gainesville will build new RTS headquarters downtownSEE STING, PAGE 4

When a traffic crash at the in-
tersection of Northwest 43rd 
Street and Northwest 25th Place sent a pedestrian to the hospital with a head injury Tuesday morn-ing, Gainesville Police officer Ben Tobias immediately posted a Fa-cebook status and tweet to alert Gainesville residents.
Tobias, a GPD spokesman, said 
he posts updates like this on social media sites several times a day. According to a survey recently published by LexisNexis Risk So-lutions, social media is becoming a popular tool in law enforcement, especially in departments serving smaller cities.  
Out of 1,200 police officers from 
small city agencies to federal agen-cies, four out of five respondents said they use social media plat-forms to help with investigations.
The research found officers 
are mainly using social media for identifying people and locations, gathering evidence and discover -
ing criminal activity.
Tobias said he doesn’t use so-
cial media as a first-line tool, but it’s helpful in assisting with inves-tigations.
“If we have a suspect, the first place we go to is Facebook, and we’ll try and use it to get informa-tion about that suspect,” he said. “We’ll also use it for a missing person situation to try and find a friend or family member.”
University Police Capt. Bart 
Knowles said his department mainly uses social media for iden-tifying suspects. 
When he has a photograph of a suspect from video surveillance and needs help identifying the person, UPD will post the photo online.
Knowles said UPD recently 
used social media to catch a wom-an who committed theft at Shands at UF.
UPD posted a photo from video 
footage that captured the woman, and someone recognized the sus-pect and called it in.
He said timeliness is one of the 
biggest advantages of social media because pictures can be posted im-mediately, and police don’t have to wait for newspapers or TV sta-tions to post them.Although the survey said dis-
covering criminal activity was a top reason officers use social me-dia, Knowles said it is too time -consuming for UPD to use it for that reason.
Although UPD officers use so-
cial media often, they don’t rely on it. Knowles said a good relation-ship with the community, where people call with concerns and tips, is key.
“Human intelligence is prob-
ably still our No. 1 advantage we have — getting people to call you that could steer you in the right  direction,” he said.
Gainesville police use social media to inform residents of crime

After an undercover Internet sex sting 
led police to the arrest of seven suspects, 
the bonds set for the convicts have shown a notable gap, despite the men being charged with similar crimes.
According to Alachua County Jail book-
ing logs and court records, five of the sus-pects were set with bonds totaling about $2.6 million. The other two suspects were set with bonds totaling $6,000.
Pierce C. Harrell, a 19-year-old UF stu-
dent, and Dennis T. LaRoche, a 30-year-old Lake City resident, along with five other suspects, were arrested earlier this week as part of Operation Tailspin, a collaborative online sexual predator operation between the Alachua County Sheriff’s Office and local police departments that lasted from July 18 to Monday.
Harrell and LaRoche were both charged 
with two counts of obscene communica-tion and one count of using a two-way communication device to facilitate a felo-ny, according to court records.Both suspects were given $3,000 bonds 
— $1,000 for each charge — which they met earlier this week.
Michael Seigel, a professor at Levin Col-
lege of Law, said bonds are usually set to make sure suspects appear at all pre-trial hearings and the trial, and also to “protect society from the defendant.”
He suggested the judge, Circuit Judge 
Thomas M. Jaworski, who handled Har -
rell and LaRoche’s first appearance, set the bond low based on several factors: the amount of evidence found against them, their ties to the community and the sever -
ity of the charges.
“They were the lowest guys of the to-
tem pole,” he said.
According to Chapter 903 of the Florida 
Statutes on Bail, bond is also determined by a defendant’s past and present conduct, including past arrests.
ASO Spokesman Art Forgey said LaRo-
che and Harrell haven’t been criminally charged prior to their arrest.
For the five other suspects, bonds were 
set higher than Harrell’s and LaRoche’s.
Demarquarius D. Truitt, 23, and David A. Hurtt, 20, were also charged with two counts of obscene communication and one count of using a two-way device to facili-tate a felony.
Both suspects are in jail with their bonds 
set at $750,000 — $250,000 per charge.
Forgey said Truitt was previously ar -
rested for felony and shoplifting charges in Georgia. Hurtt was arrested in May for marijuana possession in Jacksonville.
Michael S. Smith, 24, 
of Chiefland, and Dylan T. Kestel, 20, of Sykes-ville, Md., were both ar -
rested and charged with four counts of obscene 
communication and one count of using a two-way device to facilitate a felo-
ny.
As of Wednesday, both suspects are in 
jail with $500,000 bonds — $100,000 per charge.
Forgey said Smith was arrested in 2009 
on charges of driving under the influence, driving with a suspended license and a hit-and-run in Orlando.Kestel has no prior criminal charges, 
Forgey said.
Seigel affirmed that despite Kestel hav-
ing no prior arrests, the severity of his charges led to his higher bond amount.
Raymond E. Wortham, 38, of Archer, 
faces two counts of obscene communica-tion, one count of using a two-way device to facilitate a felony and driving with a suspended license.
Wortham’s bond was set at $100,000 — 
$25,000 per charge.
According to the Florida Department 
of Corrections’ website, Wortham served two prison sentences for attempted sexual battery of a victim younger than 12 years old.
Jowarski’s decision to set Harrell’s and 
LaRoche’s low bonds has drawn disagree-ment from the State Attorney’s Office.
Bill Cervone, state attorney for the 
Eighth Judicial Circuit of Florida, said his staff objected to the low bonds, saying they did not correspond with the charges.
“This is a decision made by the judge,” 
he said. “We respectively disagreed and urged to him that was not an appropriate amount.”

funding or apply for scholarships that require a So-cial Security number.
Alexandra Mazur, an 18-year-old economics 
sophomore, was so baffled by the scholarship she posted it on the UF Class of 2015 Facebook group page.
“There are hundreds of students who want to 
come here, and they wait for visas,” she said. “If-undocumented immigrants don’t respect our laws and regulations to get in, why would they respect them when they’re here?”
Philip J. Williams, director of UF’s Center of Lat-
in American Studies, disagrees.
Williams said undocumented students are at a 
disadvantage financially because they have to pay out-of-state tuition and fees, which for the 2012-2013 academic year at UF is $28,548 for undergraduates compared to $6,170 for in-state tuition.
“I applaud CHISPAS for doing this, and I’d like 
to see more nonprofit organizations follow their ex-ample,” he said.CHISPAS will offer scholarship

Wortham talked to the girl about 
having sex over text messages and 
phone calls. He later found out the girl was alone and asked her to walk out and meet him.
When Wortham arrived at the lo-
cation, there was no girl. Instead, po-lice arrested Wortham at the scene.  
Wortham told police he did talk 
to the girl about having sex.
He also said he was curious but 
had no intentions to meet her.
Wortham later said that if he had 
met with the girl, he would not have forced her to have sex against her will, according to the report.According to the Florida Depart-
ment of Corrections, Wortham is a registered sexual predator and has served two prison sentences for a 1999 incident where he was arrested and charged with attempted sexual battery of a victim younger than 12 years old.
He served a nearly three-year 
term, which started in 1999, and a four-and-a-half-year term, which started in 2006.
Wortham was released from Cen-
tury Correctional Institution, located in Century, Fla., on Nov. 19, 2010.
He is currently in Alachua Coun-
ty Jail with a bond set at $100,000.

When members of the UF Fightin’ Gator Marching 
Band hopped the pond Monday , they didn’t know 
their tour of London would include a surprise perfor -
mance Friday.
The band will perform at the U.S. ambassador’s 
house in London for first lady Michelle Obama, about 1,000 American military children and American and British students at Let’s Move!,  a program created by the first lady in May  to combat childhood obesity.
Marching band members were told they’d be per -
forming after they arrived in London for security rea-sons.
“The Secret Service asked us to keep that informa-
tion limited until Tuesday morning,” said Steve John-son, senior producer of special projects at UF.
The event is being co-sponsored by Nickelodeon’s 
The Big Help campaign and the U.S. Department of State. It will feature sport stations, performances and members of the U.S. delegation, the 2012 U.S. Track and Field Team and Olympic and Paralympic leg-ends.
The band’s performance will precede the Let’s 
Move! Olympic Fun Day Meetups which begin July 
28, the first day of Olympic competi-
tion in London. 
The first lady hopes the cam-
paign will encourage Americans to participate in Olympic-inspired games.
Johnson, who is traveling with 
the band, said the marching band members’ anticipation to perform had grown since their first rehearsal 
in London.
“They are beyond excited to be a part of something 
that’s larger than our average football game,” he said.UF Fightin’ Gator Marching Band

� TJ JACKSON WILL FILL THE 
ROLE.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
LOS ANGELES — A judge on 
Wednesday intervened in the tur-
moil roiling the Jackson family, ap-pointing the son of Tito Jackson to serve as temporary guardian of Michael Jackson’s children in the ab-sence of the family matriarch and in the midst a feud over the pop super-star’s estate.
Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff temporarily suspended Katherine Jackson as the children’s guardian because she was in Arizo-na and hadn’t spoken with them in several days. He appointed Tito Joe “TJ” Jackson to serve as temporary guardian with the ability to control the hilltop home where the children live and to take on other supervision duties.
Beckloff said there was no evi-
dence that Katherine Jackson had done anything wrong but instead it appeared she was being prevented from fulﬁ  lling her role as guard-ian through the “intentional acts of third parties.” He didn’t elaborate but made the decision after reading court ﬁ  lings in which TJ Jackson ex-
pressed concern that Katherine 
Jackson was be-ing prevented from returning.
He cited a 
Monday incident in which Janet, Randy and Jer-maine Jackson 
arrived at the children’s home and told them they could speak with their grandmother but had to leave with them.
“This was odd and disturbing to 
me and (the children) and height-ened our concern that our grand-mother was being prohibited from returning home,” TJ Jackson wrote in a sworn statement.
Beckloff listened as attorneys 
described Katherine Jackson’s de-meanor as unusual on phone calls placed to the children hours before the hearing.
TJ Jackson’s attorney Charles 
Shultz also revealed in court ﬁ  lings that the children were forced to miss school Wednesday because of con-cerns about their security . Shultz wrote in a ﬁ  ling that around 3:30 a.m. a new security team arrived at the Jackson home in suburban Calabasas claiming they had been authorized by Katherine Jackson to take charge.
He wrote that the guards asked 
about the children’s school. “That last inquiry caused the head of secu-rity to be concerned and he advised that (the children) stay home from school on Wednesday.”
Beckloff ruled the Jackson chil-
dren could not leave California without court approval.

96 TOTAL VOTESTuesday’s question: Did you go see “The 
Dark Knight Rises”?Today’s question: Are you going to watch the Olympic 
Opening Ceremonies?‘Gun-Free Zones’ invite aggression
This week, I am so sickened and saddened by the cine-ma shooting in Aurora that it’s difﬁ  cult to navigate my thoughts on the matter in a coherent fashion. Senseless 
acts like this boil down to something that not all psycholo-gists and sociologists will admit exists: genuine evil.
I believe very strongly in the existence of evil. I don’t buy 
into the narrative that every maleﬁ  cent act is based upon a privation of goods or a disenfranchisement of some social currency . If this reasoning were true, evil would have long ago ceased to exist, particularly in places of power and privi-lege. Evil exists in this world, and it is rarely found where we expect it to be.
Shooting suspect James Holmes was a promising gradu-
ate student. The venue was not a gang-infested slum. The targets were random and innocent. Sociology cannot explain this atrocity and neither can psychology.
The best that either may do is to assemble a list of ingre-
dients from the shooter’s background and attempt to stuff the facts into some sort of framework that will ﬁ  t each disci-pline’s parameters.
I personally do not accept this.I don’t want to politicize the deaths and injuries of the 
victims of the shooter. Those people and their families have suffered enough. I am going to say , however, that at the end of each newscast covering the story , there seems to be one of two possible conclusions drawn from this tragedy.
I would like to suggest a third possibility.Conclusion No. 1: Stricter gun control laws are needed to 
prevent such tragedies.
Colorado is ranked third in the nation by the Brady Cam-
paign to Prevent Gun Violence as having the strictest gun control laws. Furthermore, every mass shooting that has oc-curred over the last few years has taken place in “gun-free zones,” which are areas where even lawful ﬁ  rearm owners are prohibited from carrying weapons.
The Virginia Tech massacre comes immediately to mind as 
the most similar incident of recent years. And while Colora-do does grant concealed weapons permits to qualiﬁ  ed applicants, a placard on the theater entrance ef-fectively prohibits even licensed carriers from possessing ﬁ  rearms on the premises. Apparently this did not deter the shooter.
Conclusion No. 2: Because the 
shooter was not legally barred 
from owning or possessing the ﬁ  rearms he used to perpe-trate the crimes, there was no way to prevent the shooting. Within the legal framework of the state of Colorado, this is effectively true. Nobody could have predicted that Holmes was planning a massacre.
Finally, I come to conclusion No. 3: A concealed weap-
ons permit holder within the theater may have been able to disarm, deter or eliminate the threat presented by James Holmes’ rampage, had they been permitted to defend them-selves.
Concealed carry permits are granted after training and 
background check requirements are met. Not all permit hold-ers are zealots like George Zimmerman, as the press would like you to believe. They are usually thoughtful people who have put in the extra effort to advocate for themselves and others when the police may be absent. 
That is all.By requiring law-abiding citizens to disarm in certain 
venues, the only people whose safety is assured are cowards and monsters like James Holmes, who certainly chose his target very deliberately.
My thoughts and sympathies go out to the victims of this 
tragedy . I know that evil will never be fully preventable. It can, however, be contained, neutralized or even eliminated. For the sake of all of the innocent victims in Aurora, I wish it had been.
Joshua Fonzi is a microbiology and cell science and entomology 
and nematology senior at UF. His column appears on Thursdays.While the Alligator certainly has problems of its own at 
the moment, they obviously pale in comparison to the hor-rible incident at “The Dark Knight Rises” premiere in Aurora, Colo., last week. That brings us to this week’s our-thoughts-go-out-to-everyone-affected-by-this-tragedy edition of...
Darts & Laurels
Following the theater shooting last week, the media 
rushed to explain who James Holmes, the suspected shooter, 
is and why he did what he did. That’s why we’re tossing a perhaps-you-should-do-more-investigating-than-a-simple-Google-search DART to ABC Chief Investigative Corre-
spondent Brian Ross, who suggested that the suspect might be connected to the Colorado Tea Party after ﬁ  nding a Jim Holmes on the list.
First isn’t always best, Mr. Ross.Next, we present a remember-when-a-movie-ticket-was-
less-expensive-than-a-meal-at-The-Swamp LAUREL to the 
327 members of the House of Representatives who voted in favor of Ron Paul’s “Audit the Fed” bill, which proposes to shed some light on what goes on behind the closed doors of the Federal Reserve System.
Although the Fed was chartered by the government in 
1913 and its governor is chosen by the government, the Fed is ultimately a private entity, though not a market-driven one since it has been given monopoly control over the money supply.
It will be good to see what Ben Bernanke and his cronies 
have been up to if this bill passes the Senate and is signed by the president.
For being more disgusting than words can describe we 
throw a oh-wait-how-about-sick-twisted-perverted-pedo-philes DART to the seven Alachua County men arrested on 
suspicion of soliciting minors for sex during an Internet sex sting.
Gross.To wish them luck, we give a way-to-represent LAUREL  
to the UF Fightin’ Gator Marching Band, which will be per-forming before the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
You’re not only representing UF, you’re representing the 
Southeastern Conference and America! No pressure.
For being incredibly impractical and annoying, we throw 
a maybe-a-quick-search-of-the-academic-calendar-wouldn’t-hurt DART at the apartment complexes making their ten-
ants move out by July 31, more than a week before the end of Summer B/C.
Common sense escapes some people.Finally, we give a thank-you-so-much-for-your-support-
and-spreading-the-word LAUREL to our supporters. To ev-
eryone who has signed our petition and spread awareness about our Save The Racks campaign, we sincerely thank you.
If we are able to work everything out, it will be because 
of your help.
Have a fun and safe weekend, and be sure to check back 
next week.

If you give Passion Pit’s, second 
album “Gossamer” a listen, you’ll barely scratch the surface into un-derstanding the Boston-based elec-tro-synth pop group’s lead vocalist Michael Angelakos.
The group hasn’t put out an al-
bum since their debut, “Manners,” from 2009. After the release of “Man-ners,” Angelakos spent five weeks in a mental health facility .  It took more than a year of back and forth work, fatigue and stress to produce “Gossamer.”
To celebrate the sophomore re-
lease, the College Marketing Depart-ment with Sony Music, is putting on a listening party from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. at Flashbacks Cafe and Lounge, located at 211 W. University Ave. on Friday.
Flashbacks Cafe owner, Steve 
Nichtberger, opened Flashbacks Re-cycled Fashions in 1986 and the cafe and lounge in 2012.
“I love supporting everything in 
the community ,” he said. “For the event we will have a passion fruit drink special as well as other spe-cials including 2 PBR’s for $3.”
Throughout the night Sony Mu-
sic representative, Brittany Brave, will have the new album playing in the upstairs lounge of Flashbacks,.Remixes of famous Passion Pit tunes will fill the downstairs cafe.
“I will turn the album on upstairs 
around 10:30, and for the run time of the album attendees will have a chance to tweet at me or write on Facebook their views and reviews of the album,” Brave said. “I will select the top three and give out copies of the album to the winners.
Along with the albums, Brave 
will be giving out posters and stick-ers to fans. She will also have a com-puter available for those who wish to tweet or write on the Sony Music Group’s Facebook wall.Although “Gossamer” was just 
released July 24, Angelakos is taking time off to work on his own mental health. The band canceled the re-mainder of their July tour. Passion Pit will retake the stage in Chicago on Aug. 2.

When Lia-Lucine Cary was a child, her 
grandfather taught her a valuable lesson — 
that educating oneself is the most important thing one can do. Today as a middle school teacher in Hawaii, Cary teaches that lesson to her students who are raised in a culture that doesn’t encourage college as an option.
“It’s just not something that is in the every-
day vocabulary ,” Cary wrote in an email.  
To bring college into the vocabulary, the 
24-year-old UF classics and anthropology graduate started requesting that students and alumni from colleges across the nation send in letters or college paraphernalia to share with her seventh-grade students.
She plans to inform her students of college 
possibilities in a place where only 65 out of 100 freshmen will graduate high school, and of those, 34 will attend college, according to an article in Honolulu Magazine, she wrote.
Cary started teaching after college while 
living with her grandparents in Istanbul, Tur -
key. She worked at a refugee camp where il-legal residents’ children were educated
“I started feeling really desperate for these 
kids and worrying about their futures,” Cary wrote. “For the first time, I stopped thinking about myself.”
With this new perspective, she returned to the United States. In the email she expressed that like Turkey, many educational opportuni-ties depend on socio-economic status.
“It was like a veil had been lifted from my 
eyes,” she wrote. “I started realizing that the situation was not so different in my own country.”
Cary now teaches at 
Kealakehe Intermediate School in Kailua-Kona, Ha-waii, an experience that she says has revealed the value 
of teaching for her.
“This work, although literally endless, was 
one of the most meaningful things I have ever done in my life,” she wrote. “I mean, this is our future we are talking about.”
Since her time in Hawaii, Cary has noticed 
cultural trends that might contribute to the lack of college emphasis.
Because of the illegal annexation of Hawaii, 
many Hawaiians don’t view themselves as American, but as Hawaiian, Cary wrote. This creates resentment for the cultural norms of the mainland, like going to college.
There also seems to be an emphasis on 
teaching for state-issued tests, like the FCAT, which determine a school’s funds rather than long-term goals, an issue that exists all over

As a family of five crams into 
a store the size of a single-car 
garage, the owner turns side-ways, squeezes by , grabs the requested pair of TOMS shoes and sighs in relief. Soon he will have the space he needs.
Gifthorse is in its last week 
at 101 N. Main St. and is mov-ing to a location at 201 SE Sec-ond Ave. in mid-August.
Cesar Antonio Evans, 
29-year-old artist and owner of Gifthorse has contributed to Gainesville’s art and fashion scene since 2008.
When Evans was accepted to 
UF’s art program he declined, he wanted to be involved in something more public and so-cially interactive rather than be trapped in a studio.
As the economy began to 
crash, Evans bounced from job to job and noticed the good re-sponse he received from his art shows.
“I was a mediocre barista, 
and I felt boxed in,” he said. “I knew it was a huge leap, but I wanted to do something I loved and was good at and that had the chance to grow.”
That’s when Evans opene 
Berto’s in downtown Gaines-ville’s Sun Center. Berto’s sold his paintings and T-shirts he designed. It quickly expanded and Evans collaborated with other artists, which led to the formation of a new venture, The Exchange, which was located at 815 W. University Ave.
After a year and a half it was 
time for change. The move from University Avenue to Main Street happened because Evans  followed a dream, literally.
He dreamt that the storefront 
of The Exchange was obstruct-ed. In this nightmare he could get past heavy construction to the door. He said this triggered the idea of being stuck, and Ev-ans immediately signed a lease and opened Gifthorse.
The two-story corner build-
ing initially held apparel on its first floor and a contemporary art gallery on its second floor.
Now that Evans’ collection 
has expanded with brands such as TOMS, Alternative Apparel and OBEY , he uses the top floor as a studio. He doesn’t have art for sale but plans on introduc-ing paintings to the new loca-tion.
In addition to more space, the 
new location is near Maude’s Classic Cafe, Sarkara Sweets and other boutiques that attract Gifthorse’s ideal customer.
Stephanie Manone, 21-year-
old fine arts senior and resident of Arlington Square, spends most of her time downtown and is excited about Gifthorse joining the cobblestoned street.
“Whenever I drive pass 
Gifthorse I get curious, but not enough to find a parking spot” she said. “Now that it’s going to be right here I’ll have no ex-cuse.”Gifthorse is moving

Maegan Dennis / Alligator StaffDear Mediocre Advice,
I have a huge house to myself with an epic 
pool for the next two weeks. How do I get ladies in bikinis to come over?
Dear bro,
Advertise it everywhere and say there will be booze (and actually supply some). If you have friends who are girls, spread the word through them, and ask them to bring more girls. You have to be OK with the fact that a few sausages may show up.Dear Mediocre Advice,
I like this girl who has a boyfriend, but he 
treats her like crap. What should I do?
Dear troubled dude friend,
First, recognize the difference between your crush 
and her actually having a bad boyfriend. If her boy-friend really is a jerk, then tell her! Just don’t tell her you like her after. The result will not go in your favor, and you will look like a douche. Also, people love to complain. If you have been chosen as the desig-nated “relationship-complaints bro,” it might not be a bad relationship at all and she just conﬁ  des in you. I don’t know the exact situation, but if you really fear she is being abused or this guy is harmful to her, you 
have to tell her and give credible examples.
Dear Mediocre Advice,
What should you do if you break up with this 
guy, but then he asks your friends about you on Facebook all the time, then he shows up at your dorm at 3 a.m. really drunk and cries and 
throws up in your bushes?
Dear friend,
Poor guy ... let him drown in his emotions and vomit.Dear Mediocre Advice,
I like this guy, and we have fun, but I ﬁ  nd him signiﬁ  cantly difﬁ  cult to read. How do I know if the feeling is mutual?
Flirt your ass off! If he ﬂ  irts back, then 
you’re in. If he doesn’t, he’s either not interest-ed, seeing someone else or gay (or straight de-pending on what gender you are). He’s hanging out with you, so he must like something about you. Go you! You could also get really drunk together and see if he makes out with you. That 
usually works.Dear Mediocre Advice,
My roommate never picks up after herself and always gives excuses as to why not. She’s pre-law and good at verbal manipulation, and I hate conﬂ  ict. How do I get her to clean up after herself?
Dear friend,
You should weigh how annoyed you are with her habits against how much you are willing to confront her. If you do confront her, call her out when she tries to be evasive. Maybe to level the playing ﬁ  eld you could ask her if you have any roommate habits that bother her. Whatever you do, don’t leave notes around the house about it because that will make it worse (and it’s annoy-ing). Be cool and calm when you explain your concern to her, and if she’s a good roommate worth re-signing a lease with, she’ll understand. Keep in mind that habits are tough to break. So if she doesn’t immediately pick up all her crap, don’t assume you’ve lost the battle. If she still isn’t picking up after herself weeks later and it still really bothers you, I would suggest ﬁ  nding a room-mate you’re more compatible with.

The first person to DJ in North Korea will 
be a Florida Gator. Whether written, read or 
spoken aloud the sentence sounds a bit ab-surd, but for 27-year-old Brian Offenther, also known as DJ B.O., the absurdity is not unin-tentional.
Offenther, originally from Coral Springs 
Fla., graduated from UF in 2007 with a degree in philosophy . He says the city of Gainesville saved him. Offenther dove into Gainesville life in every way through involvement on campus and in Gainesville’s cultural commu-nity , something he never felt he could do in his hometown. His first DJ gig was at the now-closed bar Tim and Terry’s Music & More, where he played the type of retro music that he wanted to dance to. “I wasn’t very good but it was unpretentious and fun,” he said.
So when the former Peace Corps volun-
teer was asked by David Thomas Broughton, a British folk singer living in North Korea, to help him set up performances in Offenther’s current home of China, the UF graduate asked for only one thing in return, a chance to DJ in North Korea.
Broughton put Offenther in contact with 
Simon Cockerell of Koryo Tours, a company that organizes tourism to North Korea. After a few months of planning, the date was set for Aug. 13, and tickets became available.
Offenther said the absurdity of trying to DJ there is what initially drove him to pursuing the idea, but he also feels it could make a dif-ference in some way . “If I can open up North Korea in the tiniest amount, that would be a big plus,” he said.Although the show will not be open to the 
general public and will take place in a room that holds about 100 people in the bottom of a hotel in Pyongyang, there is a chance that a few North Koreans will be in attendance.According to Offenther, the hotel is in the 
diplomatic section of the country where the embassies are located. He said that along with tourists who are with Koryo Tours and expats who live within the embassy section, there could also be North Korean tour guides and security personnel in the audience.
“There is so little that can be known right 
now,” Offenther said of the event, but so far there is enough demand for tickets that they have scheduled a second performance during his visit.   
As for what he will play in Pyongyang, 
“An eclectic mix of rock, pop and hip-hop,” Offenther said, “and probably some Eric Clapton.” He heard the Kim family is a big fan. Among the restrictions are South Korean music and any remixes of the North Korean pop-propaganda type music he recently dis-covered.
In the future, Offenther would like to see 
himself working in the Department of State. “Most embassies internationally have some-one whose job it is to promote dialogues be-tween American culture and other countries,” Offenther said. “I want to be that person.”
He sat in his Shanghai apartment wear -
ing the T-shirt of a Gainesville band, and he said over Skype he would love nothing more than to see some orange and blue in the audi-ence on Aug. 13. “In fact, I’d even play a cou-ple Gainesville native songs if a Gator were there.” He also said they would absolutely have a free ticket to the show.

 With the opening ceremony for the 2012 
London Olympics only three days away, 
sprinter Jeff Demps woke up Tuesday morn-ing to an email sent at 3 a.m. giving him a sec-ond chance at London. 
  The email informed Demps that he was 
added to the U.S. Olympic Team with a spot in the 4x100-meter relay pool.
  His last-minute addition to Team USA 
came after Mike Rodgers was injured with a stress fracture in his left foot. 
  Gators coach Mike Holloway , who is 
also an assistant on the U.S. Olympic Team, conﬁ  rmed the email by calling Demps early Tuesday to let him know about the late deci-sion. 
  When Demps wrapped up the football 
season earlier in the year, he announced that he would pass up the NFL for a chance to compete for Team USA in London. However, he came up short in the trials, ﬁ  nishing in sev-enth place with a time of 10.27.
  With his 2012 Olympic dreams dashed, he 
started preparing for his professional track career by competing in other meets while put-ting his Olympic aspirations off until 2016.
  His latest competition was this past week-
end at the Monaco Diamond League track meet in France. There Demps ran for U.S.’s No. 2 team with Rodgers, Maurice Mitchell and Travis Patton.  
  After missing out on his ﬁ  nal NCAA Out-
door Championships because of a tweaked hamstring, Demps is feeling healthier as he heads to London to join the relay team that’s favored to win silver behind Jamaica. 
  Demps is now the 10th Gator to make it to 
the Olympics for track and ﬁ  eld. 
  In total, there are 37 Gators competing in 
London, setting the school’s all-time record for number of competitors at a single Olym-pics. In the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Florida had 34 Gators competing.

 Kelvin Taylor is no stranger to the 
bright lights in the Swamp.
  The all-time leading rusher in FH-
SAA history and son of former Gator 
Fred Taylor participated in Friday Night Lights last year.
  With the annual summer camp 
starting Friday night, Taylor decid-ed against working out and instead planned to soak in the atmosphere he enjoyed his ﬁ  rst time around.
  “It felt like you were playing in the 
Swamp. The lights were lit up bright. They had the jumbotron out there on,” Taylor said. “It felt like a real at-mosphere. It’s a very nice camp. Every year it gets better.”
  Last year was the ﬁ  rst Friday Night 
Lights for Will Muschamp. 
  Former UF coach Urban Meyer 
started the camp in 2005.
  Friday Night Lights developed 
into a recruiting staple with other schools such as Georgia, Florida State and Ohio State creating their own ver-sions.
  There isn’t anything like it today 
though, according to Derek Tyson of GatorNationESPN.com. He called Fri-day Night Lights the marquee event for summer camps.
  “It’s one night where you can turn 
on the music, you can turn on the vid-eo boards and have all the top pros-
pects into one place to really show-case your 
program,” Tyson said. 
  Prospects attending Friday range 
from rising sophomores to rising se-niors. Players like 2014 Bayside High School defensive tackle Travonte Val-entine (Palm Bay, Fla.) get another op-portunity in front of FBS coaches.
  Valentine, who holds a UF offer, 
listed Florida and Florida State as his leaders. The 6-foot-3, 283-pound tack- Gators hosting eighth

SEE JOE, PAGE 15UF Recruiting  With the eyes of the world watching, 
a spoonful of sugar will make the Dark Lord go down in London on 
Friday. Actually, it will take several spoons.
  As part of a sequence featuring famous 
characters from British literature, The Sunday Times is reporting that 30 women dressed as Mary Poppins will descend from the rafters with open umbrellas to defeat a 40-foot tall version of “Harry Potter” antagonist Lord Voldemort in a grand ﬁ  nale at the opening ceremony for the 2012 Olympics. 
  My ﬁ  rst reaction: holy [expletive], that is 
awesome!
  After that, I began to think. My world had 
been turned upside down. What other earth-shattering clashes now seemed possible in the wake of such a bold move by our friends across the pond? Here is a sports-themed take:
   Jeremy Lin vs. Tim Tebow — Ah, what 
better way to make two fading stars relevant again than an all-out battle royale broadcast-ed exclusively on ESPN2? I am thoroughly convinced I have just described Skip Bayless’s wet dream — Linsanity vs. Tebowmania.   LeBron James vs. 
Cam Newton — I’m 
not sure what this one-on-one matchup would entail, but doesn’t it just sound awesome? James and Newton are arguably the two best athletes in professional 
sports today. How about an obstacle course ﬁ  lled with throngs of angry Cavaliers fans and Harvey Updyke clones?
   Usain Bolt vs. Michael Phelps — Who 
would win in a race between the fastest man on land and the fastest man in water? If it is a 30m race, I’m putting my money on an intoxi-cated Mickey Rourke. Maybe we should ad-vocate some crossing over in Olympic events before the show gets started in London.
   Phil Jackson vs. Nick Saban — Imagine: 
an oatmeal crème pie-fueled android from the future takes on the ultimate Zen master in a strategic showdown for the ages. Sounds like a Steven Spielberg movie, right? This head- ‘Poppins v.Voldemort’ paves 
way for other dream showdowns
Joe Morgan
twitter: @joe_morganto-head battle would feature two of the greatest coaching 
minds in modern sports history. In a word, it would be historic.
Now that I have had my fun with the sports world at 
large, here are some Gators matchups that came to mind and sounded pretty awesome:
 Lauren Embree vs. Kristy Jaeckel — There would be 
a lot of firepower in a contest between the UF volleyball team’s kills leader and arguably the best player in wom-en’s collegiate tennis. This would require the ball to magi-cally transform from a volleyball to a tennis ball and vice versa every time it crossed the net, but I’ll allow it. This is all wild fantasy anyway. Kitty Cullen vs. Mike Zunino — No player has put 
more balls past goalies in the three-year history of the Gators lacrosse program than Cullen. Put a lacrosse net behind home plate, give Zunino a bat and tell the All-American slugger to swing away.
 Jordan Reed vs. Will Yeguete — Perhaps the big-
gest revelation for coach Billy Donovan’s team last sea-son was the emergence of Yeguete as a defensive force. Let’s have the Frenchman guard tight end Jordan Reed, who will serve as a nice, big target for whomever lines up under center for Florida this season. Put the two on a football field with the dimensions of a basketball court in some sort of weird basketball-football crossover, and let the games begin.
My last fantasy matchup has nothing to do with sports, 
but just humor me here. It would be epic.  Batman vs. James Bond — This would be the show-
down to end all showdowns. If I ever got to witness this battle of state-of-the-art gadgetry and cunning wit, noth-ing else would ever entertain me again. The sheer awe-someness of a Batman-Bond brawl would leave mere mortals like you and me shaken — not stirred.
While I have declined to give my take on the previous 
matchups listed, I cannot hold my tongue when it comes to this classic clash.
In the end, I believe the Dark Knight rises. This may all seem a little crazy — and stupid — be-
cause, frankly, it is. However, simultaneously, fictional battles between characters of different genres at the Olym-pics sound awesome. I like it. In fact, I like it so much, I will put five rings on it.

Urban Meyer started the camp 
in 2005, began national trend
le visited FSU last weekend.
“This is something that will really show my 
real talents,” he said. “Hopefully I can really 
come out on top. I’ve been dominant at every camp I’ve been too.”
For the UF coaches, catering to uncommit-
ted 2013 expected attendees like safety Marcell Harris (Orlando) and defensive end DeMarcus Walker (Jacksonville, Fla.) becomes easier with the entire 2013 class in attendance.
“You can hear coach speak stuff from the 
coaches. They can tell you all you want, ‘Our school is the greatest,’ this and that,” Tyson said. “The fact is when you hear from the other recruits and the other guys who are go-ing through the same process that you’re go-ing through and you can hear why they chose Florida, I think that weighs more on them than anything else in the whole process. It’s huge to have all the commits down there at one time.”
These players have built a strong bond, whether through Twitter or at other camps like The Opening at NIKE headquarters in Beaver -
ton, Ore., where seven UF commits were in at-tendance. When the commits get together, the conversation is simple.
“We are talking about the Swamp, man,” 
Taylor said. “Talking about when our time comes about winning national champion-ships.”
Taylor arrives in Gainesville Thursday. 
He’ll get a glimpse of his future Friday night, but Taylor isn’t overthinking anything.

to recruit some other guys and have a great time with the coaching staff.”recruit , from page 14

     The men started off the 2012 track and field season 
by winning the NCAA Indoor Championships for the third 
straight year. The Gators also had three indi-vidual wins courtesy of sprinters Jeff Demps (60 meters) and Tony McQuay (400m) and jumper Omar Craddock (triple jump). They edged out 2012 Southeastern Conference Indoor Champions Arkansas by five points. The men then went on to wrap up the season by winning the first NCAA Outdoor Champi-onship in Florida athletics history. The Ga-
tors won the national title despite missing Demps (100m), Gray Horn (decathlon) and the men’s 4x100m relay team. In addition to the team title, the men had three individual titles: McQuay (400m), Craddock (triple jump) and the men’s 4x400m relay.     The Gators started their postseason off by 
claiming its second SEC title in three years. Freshman Kytra Hunter won the all-around title and Alaina Johnson won the SEC bars title. In the Su-per Six, the Gators fell 0.075 points behind 2012 NCAA Champions Alabama to finish runner-up. Despite the loss, Florida had a 0.025 advan-tage over Alabama as the teams were headed into the final rotation. In total there were 10 performances of 9.90 or better for 
the Gators at the champion-ships. The day was also full of season and collegiate bests. On vault, Ashanée Dicker-son had a collegiate vault best performance of 9.95. Johnson had a season-best of 9.95 on uneven bars. Both Randy Stageberg (9.90) and 
Johnson (9.925) had collegiate-best scores on the beam. At nationals Hunter was able to win her second all-around title in the postseason to become the first Gator to win the NCAA all-around title. She also won the vault title.The Alligator Awards - Best Team

Aubrey Stolzenberg  / Alligator Staff     Coming off a national championship season in 2011, the women’s ten-
nis team’s encore was nearly flawless. Three weeks into the 2012 cam-paign, coach Roland Thornqvist’s squad fell 5-2 to No. 2 Stanford. From that point on, they never faltered. The Gators were hoisting the NCAA tro-phy over their heads 100 days later thanks to a 22-match unbeaten streak — 14 of which were against top-30 opponents. At the end of the season, UF was 27-1 and unbeaten in conference play, shutting out their opponents in 20 of those matches. They head into next season with two-straight national titles under their belt coupled with three-straight: finals appearances, SEC tournament titles, and SEC regular-season titles with an unbeaten record.

     The women’s lacrosse team advanced to the Final Four for the first 
time in its three-year history, stringing together a 19-3 overall record. After finishing undefeated in conference play and winning the regular season American Lacrosse Conference title outright, the Gators went on to sweep through the conference tournament, beating eventual national champion, Northwestern 14-7 in the finals. As the top overall seed, Florida dominated its first two opponents by a combined score of 21-6 and drew a rematch with Syracuse in the semifinals. The Orange were the last team to defeat the Gators, a 12-11 double-overtime thriller two months prior. Syracuse proved too much for Florida again by eliminating a five-point deficit in the final seven minutes of regulation. The Orange eventually scored the golden goal two minutes into the second overtime.     The Gators entered 2011 coming off an Elite Eight loss in which they squandered a double-digit second half lead. UF found the same result last March after its 14th straight 20-plus-win season, which ranked first in the SEC and fifth in the nation. Four of 26 wins came against top-25 teams. UF started the season winning 13 straight at home including an 18-point win vs. rival Florida State. In the NCAA Tourna-ment, the Gators allowed 153 points through the first three rounds, which stands as the third-fewest points allowed in the shot clock era. UF reached the Elite Eight for the sixth time in school history, tied for first in the nation with 9.6 3-pointers per game and finished the season first in the SEC in assists, assist-to-turnover ratio and 3-pointers made. Kenny Boynton and Brad Beal combined for 30.7 points per game and earned All-SEC honors.
