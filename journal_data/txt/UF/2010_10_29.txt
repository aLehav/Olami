◗ Coach Urban Meyer 
and the Gators will try 
to end their three-game 
losing streak Saturday when they take on 
Georgia at 3:30 p.m. A 
loss to UGA would hurt UF’s goal of reaching the 
SEC Championship.
“Steve Addazio is the 
definition of insanity.”
“He seriously needs to be canned.”
“It’s obvious that Addazio is in complete denial of what’s going on with the offense.”
“Addazio is in way over his head.”
“But this performance so far by Addazio is pathetic.”
“I think Addazio is secretly a ’Bama fan sent here 
to ruin Gator Nation.”
“This is exactly like Groundhog Day, except it is not funny.”
“I am convinced that nothing is going to change 
for the remainder of the season.”
Only Gators
Get OutAlive?Alan Braunstein’s love for the Gators is 
untraditional.
Braunstein, a self-described “tech 
geek” who works with software and databases in St. Petersburg, was not a college football fan 
when he moved from California. But his wife, 
Karen, a UF alumna, started bringing him to 
games in 2004, and the atmosphere of Ben Hill 
Griffin Stadium sucked him in.
When his marriage soured, Braunstein de-
manded joint custody of his adopted team.
“Even though she and I are no longer to-
gether, I’m not going to divorce the Gators,” he 
said.
But after watching Florida flounder in a 32-
13 loss to Alabama in last season’s Southeastern 
Conference Championship, Braunstein was liv-id with UF offensive coordinator Steve Addazio. He discussed purchasing firesteveaddazio.com with a friend but decided it would be too rash for one loss.
After this year’s season opener, when Florida 
managed just 212 yards against what he be-lieved to be a less talented Miami (Ohio) squad, however, Braunstein was fed up. Time to launch 
the website, he thought.
Five weeks later, when Florida played LSU, 
Braunstein strapped on a pair of orange-and-
blue camouflage pants, orange-and-blue sun-glasses, a half-orange, half-blue wig and even dyed his soul patch to match the team’s colors. He brought with him an 18-by-24 sign featuring a logo he laminated at Office Depot for $20. 
It read: “Save Gator Football: 
FireSteveAddazio.com”
“Scrap the offense Tebow ran”
Florida’s offense has found itself in an un-
usual position this season: SEC bottom feeder. Florida ranks ninth in the conference in both points per game (27.6) and yards per game (329). And, like Braunstein, many fans blame 
Addazio.
Firesteveaddazio.com has brought in more 
than 40,000 unique visitors, and the coinciding 
Facebook page has about 6,000 members. With 
Florida riding a three-game losing streak, the heat has only gotten worse.
“You can’t control that stuff, you can’t let 
negativity shape you,” said Addazio, referring 
to disapproval toward the whole team, not just 
him. “There’s not a blame. … I know society is 
maybe not much that way. It’s too bad. It’s a sad 
commentary.”
Addazio is far from alone in this plight. 
Fire(insert name).com domains are registered 
for 10 of 12 SEC head coaches, Vanderbilt’s Robbie Caldwell and South Carolina’s Steve Spurrier being the exceptions. That’s also true 
for 10 of 25 coordinators.
Not all of the websites were bought in angst, 
though. The site dedicated to Georgia’s Mark 
Richt actually reads, “This page will not be used to encourage the firing of Mark Richt or other coaches on our staff.”
And the fireurbanmeyer.com domain was 
donated to the Florida University Athletic Association by a fan in 2007. The UAA also owns the rights to potential anti-Billy Donovan 
(men’s basketball) and Amanda Butler (wom-
en’s basketball) websites.
Richt, who received his share of heat from 
fans when the Bulldogs started this season 1-4, said followers are no more rabid today as when he was an FSU graduate assistant in 1985.  
“Fans have always been that way ,” he said. 
“I think the ability to voice that concern is a 
little bit different than it used to be, especially on the Internet, where it’s very anonymous. You 
can say you’re Bulldog Joe and say what you want, not really have any accountability for the 
words.”
“Addazio’s secretly a Bama fan”
When Alan Braunstein looked into buying 
firesteveaddazio.com the week after UF beat Miami (Ohio), he saw that the domain was not only purchased but that a website was up and 
running.
Just a few hours after watching the game 
in the living room of his Chattanooga, Tenn., 
house, Ryan Moyer bought the domain and 
went to work. 
Moyer, who graduated from UF in 2005 with 
a degree in computer programming, thought about starting the website last year, but the do-main was taken at the time. 
Moyer has been a Gators fan his entire life. 
He grew up near Bivens Arm Lake on SW 
36th Place and graduated from Eastside High. 
Counting his wife’s side, there are six UF alum-ni in the family.
Moyer believed that if he did not start the 
website, another fan would. And that person would focus more on demeaning Addazio as a person than as a football coach. Not only would the attacks be unfairly harsh, Moyer said, but they would mask legitimate concerns fans have with the team’s offense.
For example, Moyer questioned why 
190-pound running back Jeff Demps re-ceived carries up the middle while 215-pound Emmanuel Moody took handoffs to the out-side. 
On Sept. 6, just one day after the website 
launched, The Gainesville Sun’s Pat Dooley criticized the website, writing that it was “the cliche of all cliches” and urging fans to “get off the ledge.” Moyer expected that reaction.
“I don’t think Pat Dooley has actually read 
the site,” Moyer said. “I don’t think he real-izes we’re not just rabid fans, that we put a lot of thought into our arguments. If someone has told Addazio about it, he probably thinks it’s just his face with a big, red ‘X’ over it.”
Senior strong safety Ahmad Black said a 
lot of outsiders have enjoyed watching Florida reach new lows this season, but he added that the team’s leaders and coaches are strong 
enough to block the negativity . 
Quarterback John Brantley agrees.“We’re a close bunch,” he said. “As long as 
we’re all still together and we’re not pointing 
fingers at anybody , that’s all that matters to us. Either way , we’re going to feel some outside pressure, but we just got to know to let it all go.”
“This website is dumb”
Regardless of how large an audience he 
gains, Moyer does not think his criticism of 
Addazio has the power to actually fire Addazio, 
something the UAA confirmed.
“People who are making comments about 
Steve, they are based on an emotional reaction,” 
a spokesman said. “They don’t know Steve or 
how much passion he has. It’s an uneducated 
opinion.”
Steve Kane, who graduated from Florida in 
1986 with a psychology degree, said he joined the movement because it’s a fun way to stay in 
touch with Gators fans and occasionally rant 
about the team. But he doesn’t think his voice affects Addazio’s job security.
Elligton Jones, a health administration 
graduate student, echoed Kane’s belief. But he said he’s been a fan since kindergarten, when he picked orange and blue as his favorite col-ors, and he thinks die-hard fans have earned the right to share their opinions, even if they’re 
negative.
Jones added that he doesn’t want Addazio 
fired, that he just wants him coaching the offen-
sive line, a group he’s worked with since 2006. 
He also said he feels sorry for Addazio because 
of the criticism, something Alan Braunstein agrees with.
“We’re a tough crowd to please,” he said. 
“We only want a BCS Championship every year 
and a Heisman winner every other year.”
When Braunstein flashed his sign at the LSU 
game, he said he was warmly received. Most people in his section agreed. They are tired of Addazio’s play-calling.
But the reaction was not universal, and one 
fan even flipped Braunstein off for expressing his distaste of the offensive coordinator. Braunstein said he did not appreciate the gesture. 
“I think there are better ways to tell someone 
you disagree with him,” he said. “But what do

Kids from around Gainesville got a spooky taste of 
sorority life Thursday night. 
Ghouls, Goblins and Greeks is an annual neighbor -
hood excursion through Sorority Row organized by 
UF Panhellenic Council’s junior division.
During the event, which ran from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., 
each of the 16 sorority houses picked a theme.
More than 100 small Super Marios, princesses and 
gladiators played games and took candy from places like Shrek’s swamp, Hogwarts castle or Dr. Seuss’ playhouse. 
Megan Merrill, 20, one of the organizers of the 
event, said she sees Ghouls, Goblins and Greeks as a way to give back.
“It’s a way to get to know and include the commu-
nity in Gainesville,” she said.
The sororities began planning at the beginning of 
the fall semester. 
Tom Hayslett, who was visiting from West Virginia 
with his children, enjoyed the gathering for its atten-tion to detail.
“The kids loved playing in Candyland,” he said. 
“Those girls did a really great job with it.”
Connecticut company creates talking doll in ‘the rent is too damn high’ candidate’s honor
NEW YORK  — The New York gubernatorial candi-
date from the “The Rent Is Too Damn High Party” now 
has a talking plastic “hero” doll that repeats his catch phrase.
A Connecticut company that makes action figures 
is selling one of New York governor wannabe Jimmy McMillan.
Priced at $49.99, the McMillan doll announces, “The 
rent is Too. Damn. High.”
Those words made him a one-theme political sen-sation when he spoke them during a debate, wearing black gloves and mutton chops.
Emil Vitale owns the online company Herobuilders.
com.
 He launched his latest product on Monday and by 
Wednesday sold a few hundred of the 12-inch figures.
Vitale says he’s seen the candidate only on TV .He also makes a plastic Sarah Palin, Barack and Mi-
chelle Obama and other talk-of-the-town figures.

Thousands of music lovers from 
all over the world will flock to down-
town Gainesville tonight for The Fest, Gainesville’s annual punk rock music festival. 
The Fest 9, which will be held to-
night through Sunday, is scheduled to have nearly 300 artists performing at various venues. 
“Last year we had close to 100 at-tendees from the United Kingdom,” said Tony Weinbender, publicist for No Idea Records and organizer of The 
Fest. “Seventy-two percent of the at-
tendees come from out of the state of Florida. Music travels further than just our little area.” 
Since its start in 2002, The Fest has 
had eight festivals and has grown in terms of both the number of art-ists performing and the 
number of attendees.
While many bands played last year, 
new bands were selected through an online application process. Fest kicks off tonightSTATE

State senator and UF professor Mike Hari-
dopolos is facing an ethics investigation. 
The Florida Commission on Ethics found 
probable cause that Haridopolos, who will 
likely become Florida Senate president in 
about three weeks, didn’t fully disclose finan-
cial information from 2004 to 2008, according to a Wednesday press release. 
“I acknowledge mistakes made on my 
financial disclosure form from past years,” Haridopolos said in a statement.
He also said the errors were unintentional 
and that he has since filed amended disclo -
sure forms.  
Haridopolos has hired Peter Dunbar, a 
former Pinellas County legislator, as his at-torney, according to a St. Petersburg Times article. The senator said it was important that he 
correct the errors quickly because he takes his responsibility to completely disclose such information with Florida residents seriously.
Albert Matheny, a UF political science 
professor and associate dean of the College 
of Liberal Arts and Scienc-es, said in an e-mail that he hopes the allegations don’t disrupt the three courses 
Haridopolos is teaching 
this term.
For now they can only 
“keep an eye on the situa-tion and hope for the best,” he said. 
Some political science professors chose 
not to comment on the investigation, and Ja-nine Sikes, director of UF public affairs, only confirmed that Haridopolos is a UF employee and earns $75,000 a year for his work. Professor under scrutiny

  Imagine you’re at a club and suddenly the music stops – 
but everyone around you keeps dancing.
  Students heading to Jacksonville for the Florida-Georgia 
football game can experience this at a midnight tailgate and 
silent disco Friday night. 
  Gainesville-based Party Degree, who brought Steve Aoki 
and JFK of MSTRKRFT to town, are kicking it off early with Midnight Tailgate, a Halloween music festival featuring some of dance music’s best new talent. 
  There will be two stages, said event producer and UF se-
nior accounting major Matt Teper. The side stage will fea-ture Silent Disco, a party where revelers enjoy live music through headphones. Take them off, and the music stops, but everyone around you is still dancing. Put them back on, and you’re right back into the mix.
  “I just thought it was one of the coolest things I’ve ever 
seen,” said Teper, who ﬁ  rst experienced Silent Disco at this year’s Bonnaroo festival. “The concept is just incredible.”
  Headlining are Gigamesh and Danny Daze, two of the 
hottest rising stars of the scene, together as the heavy-hitting side projects DiscoTech and Señor Stereo. Friday will be the ﬁ  rst chance they’ve had to perform their hit Señor Stereo material 
live.
  The party starts at 9 p.m. inside the Hyatt Regency, at 
225 E Coastline Drive across from The Jacksonville Landing, and tickets can be purchased online at www.showclix.com/event/14634 for $10. A portion of sales will go toward ForD-arfur Inc., which has raised more than $500,000 for Doctors Without Borders through events like Kanye West’s Glow in the Dark performance in Miami.
  Gainesville DJs, such as Aeriform and the Gainesvil-
lains, will be gracing the Silent Disco stage and warming the crowd up for the main event. 
  Ten minutes to midnight, and the lights will go out, the 
music will stop. Four 40-foot-by-20-foot screens will count down until the witching hour. Then, there will be lasers ev-erywhere and the headliners will take the stage. 
  “Imagine 3,500 people enjoying themselves and then 
boom!” said event producer David Sinopoli. “I think if some-one was to make the decision to try us out, they’re going to get their money’s worth and then some. Take the plunge, try something new.”  Dancers to keep to themselves at silent rave in Jax

  PENSACOLA — A karate instructor was con-
victed Thursday of leading a group of armed men 
dressed as ninjas to rob and kill a wealthy Florida couple while their nine special-needs children cow-
ered or slept nearby.
  The Pensacola jury deliberated about ﬁ  ve hours 
before ﬁ  nding Patrick Gonzalez Jr. guilty of two 
counts of ﬁ  rst-degree murder and one count of home-invasion robbery. During the four-day trial, prosecu-tors argued he led the July 9, 2009, attack on Byrd and Melanie Billings.
  The 25 family members in the courtroom hugged 
and some wiped away tears. Gonzalez did not react 
to the verdict and as deputies ﬁ  nger-printed him be-
fore leading him away, he did not appear to acknowl-
edge the family . Lawyers whisked 
the family out of a back door with-out speaking to reporters.
  Gonzalez now faces a sentence 
of death or life in prison. Jurors on Friday will decide the sentence.
  The robbers that night took a 
safe from the home that contained nothing of value, but a second safe that wasn’t stolen had $164,000 in 
cash, court records show.
        Two men who were 19 and 16 during the 2009 
home invasions testiﬁ  ed against Gonzalez. Both men face life in prison and have entered plea agreements with prosecutors in exchange for their testimony . The men said they entered the home with others but Gon-
zalez was the triggerman.
  The men said Gonzalez told the group a safe in the 
home contained $13 million that Billings obtained by 
working for the Mexican maﬁ  a.  HE SPOKE TO ABOUT 50 PEOPLE.

  Throughout his life, Efﬁ  e Eitam has been a 
member of the Israeli legislature, a brigadier 
general, an adviser and consultant to the Is-raeli prime minister.
 Yet in the ﬁ  rst minutes of his address at 
the Hillel Thursday , Eitam struck one off of his resume.
  “The news about me being the Messiah 
is completely exaggerated,” Eitam said to a crowd of 50.  “It is not accurate.” 
  Eitam spoke for more than an hour and 
a half.
He discussed some of the more contro-
versial issues regarding international poli-
tics, such as the conﬂ  ict between Israel and 
Palestine and Iran’s desire to build a nuclear program. 
  Labeling the Iranians as a “sophisticated, 
determined enemy ,” Eitam warned of the looming possibility of Iran acquiring a nucle-ar weapon. 
While he did not give a speciﬁ  c timetable 
as to when that could happen, he made it 
quite clear that Israel would not tolerate an 
Iranian nuclear state.
  “Israel will wait until the last minute [to 
engage in war with Iran], but if all else fails, Israel will defend itself,” he said. “Nuclear weapons in the hands of Iranians is not an option.” 
  On the matter of the Israeli-Palestinian 
conﬂ  ict, Eitam repeatedly emphasized that 
while the relationship between the two coun-

  Santa Fe College is preparing to 
open its new Bachelor of Science 
degree program in early childhood education this spring. 
  This will be the ﬁ  rst bachelor’s 
degree program in the education department at SFC.
  The program was created in re-
sponse to a change in the Florida Legislature, which now requires 
all pre-kindergarten teachers to 
have B.S. degrees by 2013. 
  The 36-credit-hour course will 
begin in January to give teach-
ers time to earn the new degree before the deadline, said Edward Bonahue, interim provost and vice 
president for aca-demic affairs at SFC.
  He said the new 
legislation affects all 
pre-kindergarten teachers in ac-credited schools and those in the Alachua County Public Schools Head Start/Voluntary Pre-K Pro-gram. 
  “They face the real prospect of 
losing their jobs,” he said. “They have a lot of training needs that go unﬁ  lled.”
  Most pre-kindergarten teachers 
hold an Associate of Science de-gree. An A.S. does not fulﬁ  ll entry requirements for a B.S. at a four-year university, but the program at SFC allows these students to pur-sue a bachelor’s.
  Bonahue said the college is very 
excited to offer a program that will enable teachers who are already in the ﬁ  eld and other students to move directly into the bachelor’s program.
  The program will emphasize 
school readiness, focusing on pre-literacy skills, science, math, and emotional and social develop-ment.

  “We had 651 bands apply online this year 
and out of that we picked around 30,” Wein-
bender said.
  Many of the bands performing are signed 
with No Idea Records, a Gainesville record la-
bel that has released albums for bands such as 
Against Me! and Less Than Jake. 
  This year’s headliners include Strike Any-
where, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes and A Wilhelm Scream. The artists will perform at restaurants, bars and clubs downtown.
  Weinbender said he expects more than 
5,000 people to attend this year. 
    Boca Fiesta, a Mexican restaurant and bar, will be one of the venues hosting artists for The Fest 9. Keeth Boyle, a manager, has been preparing for the increase in business. 
    “It’s all in our heads right now,” he said. 
“If every weekend was like that, it would be pretty fun. Being busy is a good problem to have.”
  Weekend passes may be purchased today 
and Saturday for $80. They will be sold from 
noon to 9 p.m. at The Fest 9 registration lo-
cated at the Holiday Inn on West University Avenue.    Tickets may also be purchased for individual shows at the doors of the venue. While some shows are free, others cost up to $20. For a detailed schedule with ticket prices, visit www.thefestﬂ  .com/fest9schedule.html. Weekend passes are $80 each

  A UF group is hoping to receive 
funding to conduct research for babies 
born with brain injuries. 
  This month, the Florida Neonatal 
Neurological Network submitted an idea in the $50,000 category of the Pepsi Refresh Project. The idea was ranked 194 on Thursday , and it must receive 
enough votes to rank in the top 10 to 
receive funding.
  The Florida Neonatal Neurological 
Network is one of 1,147 competing and the only UF campaign for infants in the $50,000 category.  
  Dr. Michael Weiss and Dr. Craig 
Sussman formed the Florida Neonatal Neurological Network hoping to im-prove the lives of babies born with brain injuries across Florida. 
  In previous years, Shands at UF was 
the only facility where babies could re-
ceive this treatment, Weiss said. Part of 
the mission of the network is to expand throughout Florida so that more facili-ties will be able to perform this treat-ment.
  The treatment has been successful in 
preventing long-term disabilities such as cerebral palsy, hearing and visual impairment and mental retardation for 
one in eight babies, Weiss said. They are 
working diligently to increase the suc-cess number. 
  “We want to continue so that we are 
helping eight out of eight,” he said. D octors hope for grantThe views expressed here are not necessarily those of the  Alligator .

Today’s question: Would you dress your pet up for Halloween?
56 TOTAL VOTES39% YES61% NOThursday’s question: Do you believe in ghosts?
Halloween about dressing down, not up
I’ve always told myself I would never be the type of 
parent who would force his dog into a ridiculous Halloween costume. 
I was reminded of this ridiculously premature asser -
tion by my roommate as she found me bullying my dog into a costume made mostly of aluminum foil and paper fins.
After removing fragments of aluminum from her 
mouth, my dog just glared at me, bitterly questioning my intentions. 
Needless to say, she will be dressed as a naked dog 
this year.
My dog has been the least of my problems this Hal-
loween season. Finding myself a costume has been harder than I imagined. 
A Peter Pan costume is impossible in this town. Not 
even looking for kid sizes, which I can somehow still squeeze into, has produced a costume.
Asking my friends for help was just as useful as ask-
ing my dog to sit still as I wrapped her in aluminum. Most of their answers involved the words sexy or Snoo-
ki.
Now before you say that’s an awesome idea, don’t.
Dressing up in all that orange would be insulting 
and probably harmful for my complexion. 
I know at least a handful of people already plan-
ning on donning a Bumpit and a can of Cheetos-orange paint. 
But the real question surrounding Halloween is: Can 
we just take any regular costume and make it sexy? 
The origins of All Hallow’s Eve was to scare away 
evil spirits, not turn them on. Naturally, I’m  mystified as to what a sexy zombie wears.It seems dressing up for Hal-
loween in all actuality is more like dressing down nowadays. 
Masks, blood and capes have 
been replaced by lingerie, nip-ple pasties and a tinge of re-gret.
Halloween has become the 
one night when you can wear 
whatever you’d like without being called a slut, accord-ing to my roommate and some philosophical skanks in “Mean Girls.” 
Regardless of where it originated, she does have a 
point.
Halloween has become a free pass for promiscuous 
behavior, and perhaps that’s why my dog, Tuna, was 
dissatisfied with her costume. It just was not risqué 
enough for her. Perhaps she wanted an aluminum bi-kini to show of her sexy tail. But I just could not be a part of that. 
With Halloween so close, I can’t help but wonder if I 
will ever find an appropriate costume in time. Consider -
ing the worst-case scenario, Tuna and I can go dressed as twins. 
With a little sedative she would sit still long enough 
to take a few pictures in our matching tuna-can cos-tumes. 
It’s either that or try to convince her to be the JWoww 
to my Snooki.
I’m sure she’ll be thrilled.

appears every Friday.After an entire week of getting all political on you and 
educating you on the basics of this critical November vot-ing game, our political pants and Uncle Sam shirts just feel 
too tight. 
Although there are so many more candidates worthy 
of our endorsement, we just don’t have the time. And we 
would never deprive you of your favorite-day-of-the-week editorial. 
We know you associate the start of the weekend with 
the swift darts and the laurels we bestow on those who de-serve such worthy acknowledgment. So, without further ado, sit back and allow us to present you with your Don’t-

Frankly, we’re ready for the election season to be over. 
Besides winter and the wonderful sweater weather it brings, election season, complete with its anticipation and 
its will-Boehner-waterboard-Pelosi-or-won’t-he antics, is 
honestly one of our favorite seasons. It brings out the very, very best in everyone. 
And “the best” isn’t just reserved to politicians. 
“The View” co-host Joy Behar, the liberal queen of 
Brooklyn, found herself in a teensy tiff with our endless 
news provider and our Tea Party queen of the west, Shar -
ron Angle, when Angle appeared on “The View” Tuesday. 
Telling the Republican candidate for one of Nevada’s 
U.S. Senate seats she would be going to hell for her latest TV advertisement that Behar described as racist and evil, “The View” turned into a political contribution machine for Angle. 
According to Angle, her campaign raised $150,000 the 
day she appeared on the talk show. So what did Angle do? She sent Behar flowers as a final-slap-in-the-face thank-you.
Not to be outdone, Behar told the Tea Partier to put her 
money where her mouth is and donate the flower mon-ey to charity instead of wasting it on flowers. Behar then pledged $5,000 to a charity in Angle’s name.
For speaking your mind and really putting your money 
where your mouth is, we’re sending Behar a You-Go-Girl-
We-Like-That-Feisty-In-You LAUREL.
And “feisty” kind of sounds like “Fest.”  It’s that time of the year when Gainesville finds itself 
inundated with even more hipsters when the annual punk 
rock music jubilation comes to town. 
Be on full alert, Gainesville police. We know with all 
your guns, pepper spray and Tasers, these kids can really 
outdo you with their mohawks and bullet belts. Let’s try to 
keep the police brutality and rioting down to a minimum 
this year. 
And you’re not immune either, Fest kids. We love all 
of you, and we’re so glad you’re here, but as soon as you leave we’re sending you off with a Please-Just-Go-Take-A-
Shower-You’re-Starting-To-Crust-Over DART.
And one last thing, Gators. Please don’t forget: If you 
haven’t already voted early or by mail, Tuesday is Elec-tion Day. 
Find your polling place, and educate yourself. Apathy 
is democracy’s kryptonite. And if you show us your “I vot-
ed” sticker we’ll give you your own Look-What-You’re-Doing-For-Democracy-Before-You-Get-Pissed-Off-Again-At-Incumbents Laurel. 
We’ll see you in November.

My first job out of college was an internship. 
I was lucky enough to get one that paid a few 
bucks for an up-and-coming startup back in 1999, 
and it was one of the defining moments of my life. That 
internship was the backbone of my career, where I gained 
knowledge (and a paycheck) that I still use on a daily basis.
 Over the past 10 years, I’ve “worked my way up” to be-
coming owner and CEO of my own startup business, Re-
sumeBucket.
I’m very fond of those early years. 
And I think it’s important to emphasize not what in-
ternship to apply for, but what to do once you have the 
job in order to really make the most out of it. As such, I have put together a few tips I would like to share with the 
current or future class of interns.
Focus on your Accomplishments
Make sure you keep a record of what you achieved at 
your company, and figure out how to best represent that 
on your resume and with your manager. Approach your duties as individ-
ual projects, and track measurable results. It pays off.
 Report your results in your work 
experience, not just “duties.” 
For example, a marketing intern could cite how many 
new followers they accumulated through a new social media initiative.
Deliver on Quality
Managers want the highest quality from their teams, so 
don’t rush your work. Pay attention to detail, from draft-ing basic e-mails to creating business documents.
The same goes for your resume since this document 
provides the hiring manager a
first impression of you.
Be Proactive
Be proactive in volunteering for projects. Your will-
ingness to take on more tasks will make a company see you as part of a larger business strategy and keep you on board after graduation.
On your resume, be sure you highlight proactivity in 
your experience, objective
statement or skills summaries.
Mind your Aptitude
Understand the skills needed for potential jobs that 
you can apply after your internship. Get involved in proj-ects that will help develop and showcase the skills that 
match a company’s needs.
Include a bulleted list of critical skills that are relevant 
to the jobs you apply for to make your resume stand out.
I hope this helps the current class of interns and every-
one who’s considering an internship in the future.
 It’s one of the most valuable experiences you can have. 
Most first-year graduates who have had an internship 
earn an average of $8,000 more than students who didn’t. In today’s economy, we can’t waste the opportunities. 
Thank you, and good luck. Ted Hekman  is the CEO  of ResumeBucketColumnist gives advice on making the most of internshipsGuest column

  Tennessee (+17.5) will cover the spread because...
  It’s basketball season, man. I have basketball fever and Ten-
nessee is a powerhouse in the hoops world. I can’t go away from them. Plus the V ols are not going to lose by more than two touchdowns. The Gamecocks are led by Steve Spurrier, 
who will undoubtedly sub out his quarterback after one inter-
ception, and Tennessee will feast on their backup signal-caller. Kyle, if you really were a “huge” basketball fan like you said you were, you would have picked the Vols. I’m disappointed.
  — ANTHONY CHIANG
  Now, on to the picks!  In ﬁ  rst place with a 43-35 record is Gatorbait.net’s Keith 
“The static makes my hair pop” Niebuhr, who has a habit of rubbing the top of his head against his laptop screen when he’s not busy watching YouTube videos during soccer games he’s 
supposed to be covering.
  Knocked off his lofty ﬁ  rst-place perch and nuzzling up to 
Keith’s rear at 41-37 is alligatorSports assistant editor Tyler “The 
Heat are great… for me to poop on!” Jett, who is all jazzed up about having a team to root against for the whole season. We 
get it, Buc Nasty, you take joy in other people’s pain. Jheri curl 
your hair, put on some purple and bust out the cane because you’re ofﬁ  cially the alligatorSports Playa Hater of the Year. 
  Also in second is the Alligator’s Kyle “Does this mohawk 
make my ass look big?”  Maistri, who’s considering a change of hairstyle for the start of intramural softball playoffs next week. 
  Next, at 40-38, is the alligatorSports editor Anthony “This 
is my happy place” Chiang, who assured us his life would be ﬁ  lled with joy as the Heat ﬁ  nally tipped off its season. If ﬁ  ve big, 
sweaty black guys make him happy, who are we to judge? 
  Straddling the fence at 39-39 is the Alligator’s Mike “I will 
be late/don’t stay up and wait for me” McCall, who thinks its 
cool to put Backstreet Boys and ’N Sync lyrics in his Facebook statuses. God must’ve spent a little less time on you, Mike.  
  Leading the charge of bad pickers at 37-41 is The Gainesville 
Sun’s Edward “I told you guys domestication can be fun” As-choff, who made a quick transition from his old single ways. No more late weekday nights at midtown or knocking back 
a few beers with the boys after a game of football. The only 
playin’ he’s doing now involves Dinosaur trivia.
  Also at 37-41 is the Miami Herald’s Joe “I don’t have time 
for this, man” Goodman, who was too busy coining descriptive phrases for LeBron’s right calf muscle to make his picks this week. We gave him McCall’s picks, which should be adequate punishment.
  And in dead-ass last place with a piss-poor record of 35-43 
is FightinGators.com’s Cody “Rain check” Jones, who can’t pry 
himself away from watching baseball and checking his fantasy teams long enough to attend any social gatherings. Why don’t 
you trade Peyton Hillis for a life, Cody? 
PICKS , from page 14for Saturday’s game.
  Sturgis won’t play: Florida began 
the week hopeful that kicker Caleb Stur-
gis could play against Georgia.
  But Meyer ruled Sturgis out for Sat-
urday’s game after the junior experi-
enced back pain following Wednesday’s 
practice. Sturgis is suffering from a hair-
line fracture of the vertebra. 
  Punter Chas Henry will ﬁ  ll in and 
kick ﬁ  eld goals for the third straight game. Meyer said Henry’s limit this week will be from 45 yards out.
  Injuries: Defensive tackle Jaye How-
ard and wide receiver Andre Debose will be limited Saturday with ankle in-juries. Also, cornerback Moses Jenkins (elbow) will be available to play for the ﬁ  rst time since the season-opener.
  But the news was not as good with 
offensive lineman Matt Patchan, who has yet to see the ﬁ  eld this season with a wrist injury. Patchan will not play against Georgia. Sturgis to sit out Saturday
NOTEBOOK , from page 14Wilbekin left game with neck strain
press defense that forced 30 turnovers. 
  “The thing that I’m more impressed with 
Kenny — and he shot the ball well — was he 
was much more efﬁ  cient on offense,” Dono-van said. “The thing that was great with Boynton tonight was his feeling and under-standing.”
  UF freshman Patric Young tallied just 
three points, a block and two rebounds in 20 minutes of play before fouling out. 
  Still, his impact was clearly felt, as he drew 
a pair of charges and commanded consistent attention from Florida Tech’s defense. 
  “I wasn’t really expecting them to double-
team me on the offensive rebound as much as they did because I only had two rebounds,” 
Young said. “But everything else out there I 
pretty much expected.”
  Will Yeguete contributed six points and 
eight rebounds in 17 minutes off the bench.
  Other freshmen making 
their Florida debuts were Cody Larson, who had just one point and one rebound in 15 minutes, and Scottie 
Wilbekin, who contributed 
two assists in ﬁ  ve minutes of play before leaving with 
a neck strain. 
  Wilbekin’s injury was minor and he was 
cleared to play in the second half, but Dono-van chose to sit him to avoid potential re-in-jury. HOOPS , from page 14

 HE RACKED UP SIX       
OFFENSIVE REBOUNDS.
By GREG LUCA
Alligator Staff Writer
gluca@alligator.org
 
Casey Prather has been draw-
ing comparisons to former Gator 
Corey Brewer since the moment he stepped on campus. 
In UF’s first exhibition game, 
the freshman showed why . 
Prather put his exceptional 
length and athleticism on display Thursday night, scoring 10 points and snatching 12 rebounds as Flor -
ida downed Florida Tech 92-58 in the O’Connell Center. 
“I’m not trying to compare him 
to Corey Brewer because he’s not Corey Brewer, but I’ll say he’s got that kind of quickness and he’s got that kind of athleticism,” coach Billy Donovan said. 
Prather was at his best when he 
was crashing the offensive glass, as six of his game-high 12 rebounds came on that end of the floor. The 
freshman also contributed two 
assists and two steals during his team-high 25 minutes of play . 
“It was amazing,” Prather said. 
“At first I was kinda nervous, but after warming up and getting 
loose with the team I kind of got a 
feel for the fans, so I was fine.”
After leading the team in scor -
ing with 22 points in last season’s exhibition opener, sophomore Kenny Boynton nearly put on a re-peat performance Thursday, scor -ing a game-high 24 points. 
He showed off his new shoot-
ing motion, converting four of five three-point chances in the second half.
In the opening thirty minutes, 
Boynton was just 0 for 1 from dis-tance as the team went 0 for 5 from behind the arc.
“In the first half I think we at-
tacked the rim well, rather than last year where we didn’t do that,” Boynton said. “I think that’s a new area we can attack, and then in the second half we got it going from the outside.”
Overall, Boynton was 10 of 15 
from the field. 
He also grabbed five rebounds 
and two steals as part of a Florida

We know, all of the readers out there 
thought we bottomed out with a Mar -
shall-East Carolina debate last week. 
But you severely underestimated 
our ability to stomach and debate ter -
rible college football here at the alliga-
torSports Brand Picks Column.
So this week, we’re going even low-
er than C-USA. 
This week, we’ll argue about two 
teams in the saddest division in all the land — the Southeastern Conference East. 
No. 20 South Carolina is the only 
team in the division with less than three loses and an AP ranking in front of its name. 
The Gamecocks, the class of this pa-
thetic group of underachievers, take on the Volunteers at home this week with a monster spread to cover. 
Tennessee has really had a rough 
go of things since the season-opening 
drubbing of perennial powerhouse 
Tennessee-Martin. 
Needless to say , like the SEC East, 
we’ve hit a new low this season. 
South Carolina (-17.5) will cover 
the spread because…
Unlike Anthony , I don’t bet on a 
head coach who compares his team 
to Nazis and players who aren’t good 
enough to make a bowl game at the end of the season. Anthony can iden-tify with Tennessee, sure. They’re both lovable losers incapable of harming so much as a fly , but I really see no reason to pick the V olunteers this week. 
I know Chiang is pumped for the 
start of basketball season (by pumped 
I mean spending a lot of time alone 
with his life-sized posters of the Big Three, or as he likes to call them, “my best friends.”) but as long as these two schools are playing football this Satur -
day, South Carolina should run away in a laughter.

The Gators’ offense has lacked explosive-
ness this season, but Saturday it will add a play-maker to its arsenal.
Coach Urban Meyer announced Thursday 
that junior Chris Rainey will play against Geor -
gia. Rainey had been suspended the previous five games after an aggravated stalking arrest on Sept. 14. Meyer ruled the big-play threat eligible for this week’s game on Monday , but he waited to see if Rainey could meet all of his behavioral obligations before deciding if he would play.
Rainey completed them all “and beyond,” 
according to Meyer.Before the wide receiver was arrested, he 
caught six balls for 34 yards in two games. However, Florida doesn’t just plan to use Rain-ey on the outside. UF will also utilize him in the backfield. He played running back in his first 
two seasons as a Gator.
“It’s going to be probably 
50-50 (between the two po-sitions),” Meyer said. “We like to do a lot of two-back things. [Rainey] will be the second one. A little bit like we did with Omarius Hines last game.”
Running game coming 
together: Injuries have derailed Florida’s rush-ing attack this season, but the Gators are hoping their stable of backs can heal up in time to get back on track Saturday.
Running back Jeff Demps, who has been 
limited the past four games with a sprained foot, is inching closer to a full recovery.
“It’s the best he has been in five weeks,” 
Meyer said. “I would say he is not 100 percent yet, but I’m hoping he’ll be 100 percent at game time.”
A healthy Demps would mean a lot to UF’s 
struggling offense. The running backs have not broken a run longer than 19 yards in the last five games. Demps tallied three runs longer than that in the first two games of the season before he suffered the injury against Tennessee.
He won’t be alone, however. Meyer declared 
running backs Mike Gillislee (hamstring) and Emmanuel Moody (thigh bruise) 100 percent

  It came a lot earlier this year. 
  And the stage isn’t nearly as big as it 
usually is. 
  But make no mistake about it, IT is here. 
  This Saturday, Florida will play its most 
important game of the season — a title usu-ally reserved for a showdown in Atlanta or a title shot at the BCS Championship Game location.
  Not this year.   Two unranked Southeastern Conference 
teams will battle it out in Jacksonville, and the consequences are dire. 
  As bad as it’s been — and losing to Mis-
sissippi State at home is Bad with a capital B —  the Gators can still make something of what looks like their worst season under coach Urban Meyer. 
  If they can beat the Bulldogs, they will 
still control their own SEC Championship  destiny. And back-to-back wins against Georgia and Vanderbilt would go a long way in picking up some momentum and 
conﬁ  dence heading into a Nov. 13 battle 
with South Carolina for the right to get the 
crap beaten out of them by Alabama or Au-
burn (Kidding. Relax. OK, I’m kind of seri-ous …)
  Watching UF play the last three games, 
it would be ludicrous to suggest this team 
is capable of not only winning the East, but 
pulling an upset in Atlanta and getting to a BCS bowl game. But if Florida beats Geor-
gia, that crazy dream will still be out there. 
  Gators fans will still have hope, no matter 
how unlikely a scenario that seems. 
  However, if UF loses this game, what are 
we realistically looking at for the rest of the season?
  The SEC title game will be all but out of 
reach, and Florida will have lost four games 
in a row for the ﬁ  rst time in more than 20 years. 
  Losing to Georgia would mean a loss af-ter a bye week and a loss to a rival — two things that just don’t happen to Meyer. 
  Losing to Geor-
gia would mean the coaches will have to ﬁ  nd some other way to explain this sea-son’s struggles besides injuries, as Meyer ex-
pects to have a mostly healthy squad with two weeks of rest under its belt against the Bulldogs. 
  Losing to Georgia would mean this team 
could be heading for a 6-6 regular season. UF will almost deﬁ  nitely be underdogs against South Carolina and FSU later in the year. 
  Once-proud programs like Tennessee, 
Michigan and Notre Dame have all had his-torically bad seasons in recent years in which they failed to even make a bowl game. From afar, outsiders like myself, and probably any Gators fans reading this, watched these teams collapse and wondered how it’s pos-sible for a powerhouse to crumble so quickly and swiftly. 
  The answer is: Somewhere along the way 
they lost a game or two like this one. 
  Fans and media alike called for sweeping 
changes in game plan and personnel after the loss to MSU, but listening to the team talk for the last two weeks, it sounds like few changes, if any, will be made. 
  The Gators will ﬁ  ght the Bulldogs with 
more or less the same blueprint that has landed them in this precarious position ex-pecting different results. 
  The same result — a loss — may send a 
big enough tremor through the program to inspire some of those changes that everyone outside of the program is looking for. 
  But by then it will be too late to save the 
season.

As has happened for the last four au-
tumns, the Florida soccer team quietly has 
a chance to bring the first fall championship to Gainesville. 
Standing in the way is its newfound rival: 
South Carolina.
Tonight at 7 in Columbia, S.C., the No. 8 
Gators (14-2-2, 8-1-1 Southeastern Confer -
ence) challenge the No. 17 Gamecocks (14-3-2, 8-1-1 SEC) for conference supremacy.
The winner is crowned the SEC cham-
pion and notches a No. 1 seed in the confer -
ence tournament. 
For seniors Nicky Kit, Ashlee Elliott and 
Katie Fraine, it’s their last regular-season game and last chance to leave Gainesville with a ring on every finger.
“You come to Florida to win champion-
ships,” Fraine said. “You come to play the best teams in the country. If we win this one, we’re bringing home another [champion-ship].”
Coach Becky Burleigh, who started Flor -
ida’s program in 1995, is seeking her fifth straight conference championship and 11th overall. Burleigh has built the Gators into a national powerhouse and the most domi-
nant team in the conference.
When asked what winning a fifth straight 
title would mean for the program, she said, 
“I think it’s big on consistency for sure. It’s not easy to do every year when you have 
that target on your back. A lot of credit goes 
to our players for not taking anything for 
granted and coming out each season with 
that as a goal.”
Tonight’s finale is like déjà vu, as last sea-
son the rivalry intensified when the Gators closed out the regular-season finale with a 
3-0 home victory against the Gamecocks, se-
curing the conference championship. How-ever, just one week later in the semifinals of 
the SEC Tournament, South Carolina beat 
Florida 1-0 en route to its first ever tourna-
ment title. 
“They outworked us [last game],” Fraine 
said. “They beat us fair and square. It was 
heartbreaking. It makes us really want to show them that they don’t have a right to steal our championships.”UF volleyball begins road trip
Florida has defeated nine ranked teams 
this year and has played arguably the tough-est schedule in the nation, but with six of the team’s final eight matches on the road, the hardest part might still be ahead.
The No. 1 Gators (19-1, 12-0 SEC) will 
begin their three-match road trip when they take on Ole Miss (16-5, 10-2 SEC) tonight at 8 in Oxford, Miss. 
“Winning on the road 
is really, really hard in this day and age in women’s volleyball,” coach Mary Wise said. “That will be the challenge for our team, 
the next challenge to come for over the last month. You go through the NCAA 
Tournament and who knows if we’ll have any matches at home? From the very first match it can be on the road.”
UF is coming off limited rest, ending a 
five-match homestand Wednesday after de-feating South Carolina 3-0 (25-20, 25-17, 25-
13 ). 
“We have the challenge of going on the road with a quick turnaround from a 
Wednesday night home match to Friday on the road at Ole Miss,” Wise said. “They’ve 
positioned themselves — if the bids came 
out today, they’re in the NCAA Tourna-
ment.”
After this road trip, Florida will have two 
matches in Gainesville before ending the 
season with another three away from home.
The Gators defeated the Rebels 3-0 (25-18, 
25-19, 25-19) in Gainesville on Sept. 26.
“They are very athletic, and they have 
two of the premier middles in the league,” Wise said. “I think the biggest change in 
their team is how well their setter plays.”
Ole Miss middle blockers Regina Thomas 
and Miranda Kitts rank second and eighth, respectively, in the SEC blocks standings. As 
a team, Ole Miss trails only Florida in that 
category. 
The Rebels’ setter, Amanda Philpot, was 
named SEC Player of the Week last week af-
ter recording her first triple-double.
“This is a big challenge for our team,” 
Wise said. “The toughest part of our season 
is still ahead of us.”

UF coach Urban Meyer is 31-3 when having more than a week to 
prepare for a game in his career.

Forget cocktails.
This will be the world’s largest outdoor funeral, 
with either Florida’s offensive struggles or the Gators’ season being laid to rest.
The annual Florida-Georgia showdown in Jack-
sonville always earns special attention on the calen-dar, but this year’s meeting is especially crucial for UF. With three straight losses and mounting fan frus-trations, the Gators are in desperate need of a win.
“I like the word urgency instead of desperate,” 
Florida coach Urban Meyer said. “Desperation sounds awful desperate. I like urgency.”
With a victory, Florida (4-3, 2-3 Southeastern Con-
ference) still controls its destiny in the SEC race, but a performance like the 10-7 loss to Mississippi State two weeks ago would send the season into a tailspin — even leaving the door open for the Gators to miss a bowl game altogether.
“[We need a win] real bad,” safety Ahmad Black 
said. “These next couple games are huge for us. Like coach said a couple times, we need to get urgent about everything.”
But the major improvement doesn’t need to come 
from Black’s side of the ball.
There’s no secret as to the reason for the recent 
skid. The offense has floundered early and often this season, and Meyer spent last week’s bye analyzing what went wrong.
He came up with four main problems: turnovers, 
a lack of big plays, poor passing efficiency and incon-sistent red-zone production.
With two weeks to address those issues, a recur -
rence would be alarming, especially given Meyer’s career record of 31-3 when having more than a week to prepare for a game (16-1 at UF).
Meyer said the scheme had been “modified quite a 
bit,” but he’ll be counting more on having a full com-plement of playmakers. Running backs Jeff Demps, Mike Gillislee and Emmanuel Moody should all be close to 100 percent, and slot receiver Chris Rainey will make his return after serving a five-game suspen-sion.
Receiver Andre Debose (ankle) will be a game-
time decision.
“I’ll give you a great excuse: we’re in and out of 
injuries the whole year,” Meyer said.
The Bulldogs (4-4, 3-3 SEC) can identify with their 
rival’s struggles. Georgia started the season 1-4 but has reeled off three straight wins, averaging more points in those games (42.7) than Florida has scored in its last three contests combined (42).
Receiver A.J. Green’s return from an NCAA sus-
pension had a lot to do with that resurgence, and he’s posted better numbers in four games than any Florida receiver has in seven (365 yards, four touchdowns).
But the Bulldogs have also ben-
efited from facing weak opponents, as their win streak came against three of the SEC’s bottom four scor -
ing defenses. By the same token, UGA coach Mark Richt attributed 
the Gators’ problems to their oppo-
nents.
“[Fans and the media] have a 
hard time giving everybody else 
credit,” Richt said. “They played Alabama, they 
played LSU and they played Mississippi State, and those are probably three of the top 10 defenses in the country. … I think they’ve played against some pretty dadgum good defenses, and that’s been part of the 
issue.”
The other part has been Florida’s sloppy execution, 
and focus shouldn’t be an issue against one of UF’s 
biggest rivals. Video of Georgia’s mid-game end-zone celebration against the Gators in 2007 has been played on loop in the football offices, but Saturday’s motiva-tion should come from the more immediate past.
“That happened three years ago,” guard Carl John-
son said. “They’re playing that [video] like crazy, but 
that’s not going to help us.”UF looks to fix offensive struggles, end three-game skid
