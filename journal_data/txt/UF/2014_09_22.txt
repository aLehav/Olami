Pine needles and overgrown 
grass litter the dirt road to Don 
Charles Spirit’s empty home.
It’s the same road Gilchrist 
County ofﬁ  cers raced up Thurs-day afternoon after Spirit called dispatch and threatened to hurt 
himself, his daughter and his six 
grandchildren.
It’s the road those children 
once stomped up after school. And it’s the same road a single 
cop car later closed off with crime 
scene tape, shielding the scene where Spirit shot each of his fam-ily members shortly before turn-
ing the gun on himself.  
When ofﬁ  cers arrived Thurs-
day, Spirit had already pulled the 
trigger on his daughter, 28-year-old Sarah Lorraine Spirit, and her six children: Kaleb Kuhlmann, 11; 
Kylie Kuhlmann, 9; Johnathon Kuhlmann, 8; Destiny Stewart, 
5; Brandon Stewart, 4; and the youngest, Alanna Stewart, who would have been 3 months on 
Sunday.
An ofﬁ  cer brieﬂ  y confronted 
Spirit before he pulled the trigger 
again and took his own life.
Alanna will never learn to 
walk, and Sarah will never see her children grow.
The shooting shook the small 
community of Bell, Florida, about 
an hour outside of Gainesville, 
where about 350 people live.
It’s the kind of place where 
doors are left open, cats sleep on window sills, and asphalt roads 
are few and far between.
But Bell was bleak the day af-
ter Don’s spree, when eight of its 
residents were lost to bullets.

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — Florida had its op-
portunities against No. 3 Alabama on Saturday.
But it could not execute.
The Crimson Tide handed the Gators oppor-
tunities to score on a silver platter.
Four forced turnovers. Four possessions that 
started in Alabama’s territory.
Despite all that, Florida struggled to accu-
mulate 200 yards on offense while its defense surrendered the most in program history as the Crimson Tide rolled to a 42-21 victory at Bryant-Denny Stadium in front of a crowd of 101,821.
Florida’s Achilles heel was third down, going 
just 2 of 13 on offense while letting Alabama con-
vert on 12 of its 16 attempts.
“As the game went on, we just wore down,” 
UF coach Will Muschamp said. “We had a hard 
time hanging in there in the running game. You have to be able to sustain some drives. We had some tempo planned for the game but we couldn’t sustain drives offensively and if you can’t stay on the ﬁ  eld with the tempo, you put your defense back on the ﬁ  eld.”
Alabama (4-0, 1-0 Southeastern Conference) torched Florida (2-1, 1-1 SEC) for 645 yards — 16 more than the previous record set by Nebraska in the 1996 Fiesta Bowl. The Crimson Tide had 
449 yards through the air, which is the second 
most the Gators have given up in one game in 
program history.
Alabama receiver Amari Cooper seemed to 
be indefensible for most of the game, grabbing 10 catches for 201 yards and three touchdowns.
“He’s a great player,” safety Keanu Neal said. 
“We could have stopped him, but there was a lack of communication on our part so we didn’t do that.”
That lack of communication was evident 
throughout the contest’s entirety. 
Alabama had 11 plays that spanned at least 15 
yards compared to Florida’s four.
Crimson Tide quarterback Blake Sims tallied 
445 passing yards against the Gators.
“As you can see, that was a game of big plays,” 
UF quarterback Jeff Driskel said. “Alabama had a lot more than us.”
Florida kept itself in the game early on the 
back of its defense.

Gov. Rick Scott later spoke at a 
press conference.
Down the main road, Dolores 
Miudlin sat behind a table col-ored with fresh produce. She sold cantaloupe-sized green peppers, softball-sized peaches and home-
made jams in glass Mason jars, 
but her mood was grim.
The 65-year-old said her 
daughter, Becky Brock, worked with Sarah. 
Brock was shocked. She said 
she didn’t think the family had problems.
“You don’t expect something 
like this to happen,” Miudlin said, “especially in a small town like this.”
However, the family’s records 
weren’t spotless.
More than 10 years ago, in 
2001, Don told officers he acciden-tally shot his 8-year-old son in the head while the two were hunting. 
He was arrested for possession of 
an illegal firearm and spent three years in prison.
In August 2008, Sarah Spirit 
placed a call on Don Spirit for domestic violence, but he wasn’t officially charged.
Officers said Sarah served pro-
bation for grand theft charges last year.At about 1 p.m. Friday, Scott 
stood on the steps of the Gilchrist County Emergency Operations Center.
“It is an unbelievable tragedy,” 
Scott said during a press confer-ence on the tragedy. “We have to say a prayer for this family.”
Gilchrist County officers stood 
behind Scott in deep green uni-forms with their hands folded at their stomachs and their faces re-
flecting the community’s grief.
“You don’t know what goes through a suspect’s mind when 
this happens,” Scott said.
Lt. Jeff Manning choked on 
his words. At one point, he put his head down as tears filled his 
eyes.
“Everybody knows everyone,” Manning said of the community.
Gilchrist County Superinten-
dent of Schools, Robert Rankin, 
read from a piece of paper.
“As you can imagine, this has 
been a tough day,” he said. “We pray that God will be with us in the days ahead.”
After school Friday, Gilchrist 
County officers guarded stu-dents at Bell Elementary School. Two boys with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle backpacks walked with their mother to her car. A 
red-haired woman held her child 
tightly, slowly rocking him back and forth in the sticky afternoon air.
“Have a great weekend,” Dep-
uty CJ Schauble yelled to students boarding buses before smacking a pair of love bugs on her forearm.
Schauble has been working 
at Bell Elementary School for 14 years. She knows all of its chil-dren. She knew the ones who died.
Before long, the street in front 
of the elementary school fell qui-et. Students had been picked up. A few cars buzzed in the back-ground. An occasional word was 
said.
Schauble continued to wave at 
the last buses.
It was the same wave she gave 
to the children shortly before they 
died.MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 3

Under the orange glow of a 
metal chandelier and a ceiling 
draped in gold and ruby fabric, more than 60 people packed in-side the small Stubbies & Steins 
pub Saturday night, savoring 
their last sips of its exotic beer selection.
The facade of the 11-year-
old Gainesville staple twinkled with strings of white Christmas lights on one of the last week-ends of its life.
On Sunday, its lights will 
twinkle no more. The chande-lier will be lowered. And the bar that brought craft beer to Gainesville will close its doors for good.  
Stubbies was a labor of love 
for owners Berkeley Hoflund and her late father and former UF chemical engineering pro-
fessor Gar Hoflund. The pub 
stemmed from a mutual love of traveling, beer and beer T-shirts — which Hoflund collected in the thousands.
In 1998, the two decided to 
open a bar back home while on a trip to Kyoto, Japan.
“In a way, Stubbies grew out 
of our travels together,” Berke-ley Hoflund, 39, said.
The original bar, Stub-
bie Shirt Pub — named after the Australian word for short beer bottles — opened in 2003. Though its name later changed to Stubbies & Steins after the addition of a German-inspired 
side in 2008, it still stands at 9 
W. University Ave. today.
It opened with a selection of 
60 beers that has since grown to more than 400, including brews from Australia, Scandinavia and the Caribbean.
“Stubbies is kind of the 
beer-culture epicenter of 
Gainesville,” said Deno Stelter, 
a 28-year-old UF astronomy graduate student who has been coming to Stubbies for more than six years. On Saturday night, he and 
fellow astronomy graduate stu-dent and regular Dan Gettings, 28, remembered the bar that 
had become “like a gathering 
place” to them.
Amanda Townsend, an as-
tronomy graduate student, said she remembers the first time Stelter and Gettings brought her to Stubbies and introduced her to its ice cream beer float.
“It was one of the first bars 
I came to in Gainesville, and honestly, if they were going to be open forever, it would be the last bar I came to in Gainesville,” said Townsend, 28.
The three heard of the bar’s 
closing through a Facebook post Hoflund wrote Thursday.
Hoflund has been battling Celiac disease since 2011, which prevents her from eating glu-ten. Since she was diagnosed, she has only been able to drink 
gluten-free beer.
Two years later, her father 
died suddenly at 65.
“It became difficult to even 
walk in the doors some days,” 
Hoflund said.
The loss of her father and 
her battle with Celiac led her to close the bar.
Hoflund said she will take 
the long-lasting friendships cultivated at Stubbies on her new journey in life. She plans to travel, starting in Japan where the idea of Stubbies began.
Through the years, people 
have met at Stubbies and later married. One couple even nick-named their baby “Stubby” while in the womb.
“It makes me feel like the 
last 12 years were really worth-while,” Hoflund said.
As the week winds down, 
Hoflund said she hopes people will come in and share their fa-vorite memories.
Perhaps appropriately, the 
closing coincides with what would have been her father’s 67th birthday on Friday.
On Saturday night, the fi-
nal toast will close out the bar. 
The checkered flags and family 
crests will be taken down.
Gettings and Stelter plan to 
be there and say goodbye to the Gainesville staple that fostered their passion for beer.
“I’ll probably cry a little bit,” 
Gettings said.
“More than a little bit,” 
Stelter corrected. “We’ll be here until they lock the doors.”

A Gainesville man was arrested on charges 
of aggravated child abuse after police say he 
beat his son shortly before 11 p.m. Friday.
The 15-year-old victim fled his home at 
3301 SW 13th St. to a nearby corner store for 
help. He had swollen eyes, a bloody lip and 
gashes on the back of his head after he said his father, Arthur M. Clark Jr., beat his head into the floor.
The teenager then called Gainesville Police. 
The victim told officers Clark also grabbed him by the throat, GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said in an email, almost causing him to pass out.
Officers said Clark, 35, told them his son 
was disrespectful, which he said prompted the beating.

GPD officers responded to a call regarding 
a disturbance among neighbors Saturday at about 6 p.m.
Adalia Barner, 23, was arrested on charges 
of aggravated assault with a firearm at 110 SE 
15th St. after she pointed a handgun at two 
neighbors, Tobias said.
The two parties got into a oral argument 
after Barner and her sister confronted their upstairs neighbors about being too noisy.
“Who ever wants some can get some,” 
Barner said to the victims that evening as she stood in their doorway, according to the re-port.
Officers retrieved the weapon and placed 
Barner under arrest.
Barner’s bond is currently set at $50,000.

A Gainesville woman was charged with 
driving under the influence and causing prop-erty damage after police say she was involved in a traffic crash at about 1:30 a.m. Saturday.
Natasha A. Morea hit the rear end of a 
van traveling on Northeast Waldo Road at the 1200 block, causing the van to overturn, Tobias said. GPD officers said the 35-year-old smelled of alcohol, according to a report.
After refusing to perform field sobriety 
exercises, Morea gave breath samples of 0.184 and 0.195. The legal limit is 0.08.Police roundup:

STUDENT GOVERNMENT
ARIANA FIGUEROA
Alligator Staff Writer afigueroa@alligator.org
Against a stacked roster of Swamp Party 
candidates campaigning on Turlington 
Plaza and outside of the Reitz Union, Evan 
Morris and Preston Jones 
stick to word-of-mouth tactics.
Morris, a UF market-
ing junior, and Jones, an 18-year-old UF civil engi-neering freshman, stand alone on the Student Gov-ernment 2014 Fall elec-
tions ballot as independent candidates for 
Student Senate.
Morris, who is running as a senator for 
District B, which includes zip codes east of campus, said he chose to run independently because UF currently has one major party.
“That’s a dominant party system of gov-
ernment, and it’s unhealthy for UF, for our government to be run that way,” the 20-year-old said.
Morris is still working 
on his campaign platform, 
but topics such as the 
environment and safety, 
especially sexual assaults by an unknown attacker, are his top priorities.
“We need to find a way 
to keep our students safe, as well as keep crime off 
our campus,” he said.
But even if Morris doesn’t win, he said 
he hopes to inspire students to run in the Spring 2015 elections.“I want to encourage all students to vote 
and to realize the problems that are hap-
pening in the system,” he said.
As a resident of Hume Hall, Jones decid-
ed to run for a Senate seat after attending a 
UF Honors retreat before classes began.
Jones said he decided to run as an inde-
pendent so he could have the freedom to 
represent the interests of everyone in his 
residence hall.
“What really pushed me toward run-
ning was meeting with some of the people 
in Hume,” Jones said.
With the concern about the scarcity 
of blue lights on campus, Jones walked 
around Hume and mapped out all the blue 
lights, finding only two blue lights around 
the residence hall. Residents have told Jones that they are nervous walking back from GatorNights at the Reitz Union because of the poor lighting.
“I think something we should strive for 
is to have two visible blue lights wherever you are on campus,” Jones said.
UF political science professor Stephen 
Craig knows the difficulty independent candidates face when campaigning.
“Independents are largely perceived 
as candidates who don’t seem to win,” he said. “For the most part, if you’re gonna run as an independent, you have to be com-
mitted to believing in what you say.”
Megan Williams, 20, usually doesn’t 
vote because of the Swamp Party’s majority 
status, but she said she would vote for an 
independent.
“It shouldn’t be dominated,” the UF reli-
gion junior said. “It should be a variety.”Two students running for Student Senate as independentsStubbies & Steins pub to close this weekend

� ABOUT 88 PERCENT OF PEOPLE UNDER 
30 READ A BOOK IN THE LAST YEAR.
CHANTELLE MORGAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Millennials are reading more than older genera-
tions, but not at the library.
Even at Library West — where the undergradu-
ate student checkout limit is 150 books at one time 
— students are accessing stories on their smart-phones and other devices instead.
Eighty-eight percent of Americans younger 
than 30 said they’ve read a book in the last year, according to a Pew Research Center study — 9 per-centage points more than the 79 percent of those 
older than 30 who did.
UF telecommunication senior Matthew Long 
said he thinks millennials spend their time on so-
cial media but still understand the importance of literature.
“Why go to the library when we can access the 
information on our smartphones?” Long, 21, said.
Sylvia Ashwell, a librarian at the Alachua Coun-
ty Library District, said even though people older than 30 are using the library more, they typically check out movies rather than books.
“I like that fact that younger people are reading 
more,” Ashwell said.
Library West supervisor Dina Lopez said the 
more a student has access to technology, the more 
he or she is able to read.
“The generation that’s a little bit older may not 
be as technologically savvy,” Lopez said.Millennials read

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
LONDON — The debate over 
Scotland’s future fizzled amid a bit-
ter war of words Sunday, with the Scottish leader claiming his country-men were “tricked” into rejecting 
independence in a referendum and 
Britain’s three main political parties bickering over how to take political reform forward.
Alex Salmond, Scotland’s outgo-
ing independence leader, accused politicians in London of reneging on their promises to hand more power to Scots in a rare cross-party pact that he said played a crucial role in swinging the votes in favor of union in Thursday’s vote.
His comments came after Prime 
Minister David Cameron stressed that plans to empower Scots should be linked to constitutional reform in England — a stance that fractured the fragile political consensus and drew attacks from across the spec-trum.
Just days earlier, Cameron and 
his political rivals had joined to-
gether in a vow to quickly pass laws 
to transfer key decision-making powers from London to Scotland’s capital, Edinburgh. All three party leaders signed off on the pledge, which promised Scots new powers 
to decide on their 
tax, budget and welfare policies.
Since then, 
Cameron said those changes must be made “in tandem” with re-form in the House of Commons to 
bar Scottish lawmakers from having a say on bills that only apply to Eng-land and Wales — a longstanding grievance that has come to the fore amid the debate.
Critics say that throwing those 
questions into one basket dilutes the 
leaders’ joint pledge and will inevi-
tably delay the promised return of powers to Scotland.
“It’s the people who voted No 
because they believed these com-mitments from the Westminster leadership — these are the people who are feeling most angry, most hurt, most disappointed in Scotland 
today,” Salmond told the BBC. The 
politician has said he will step down as Scotland’s first minister in No-vember, after the failure of his pro-independence campaign.
All three British parties insisted 
they would fulfill their vow, though 
they clearly differed on the English 
reform question.
Nick Clegg, Cameron’s deputy 
and leader of the coalition’s junior party, the Liberal Democrats, said the promise to Scots “cannot be made contingent on other consti-tutional reforms.” The opposition Labour Party’s leader Ed Miliband 
similarly said that there could be 
“no ifs, no buts” about delivering new powers to Scotland.

GatorWell will offer sexual vio-
lence prevention programs to bring 
attention to consent on campus.
GatorWell has introduced a “Yes 
Means Yes” seminar and a “Bring-ing in the Bystander” intervention training to empower students.
“You learn certain things in high 
school health class or other health classes, but it’s not this,” said Rita Lawrence, GatorWell interpersonal violence prevention coordinator. 
So far, 21 people have applied for 
“Yes Means Yes,” a five-week, non-credit seminar that meets Wednes-days from 6:30 to 8 p.m. starting Oct. 8. The seminar, which has 35 spots available, will feature guest speak-ers and discussions on sex topics. 
Lawrence said the seminar will 
help people feel comfortable with their sexuality and teach them about what equality means for society.
“When sexual assault happens, 
‘Oh, that’s a women’s issue,’” she said. “No, it isn’t. It affects everyone because everyone knows and loves those women. Those are the moth-
ers and partners and best friends, 
so when someone is hurt by sexual violence, everyone suffers.”
Sylvia Stankov, a UF microbiolo-
gy sophomore, said she understands the importance of teaching consent.
“Whether you say yes or no in 
any situation,” Stankov, 19, said, “whether it’s sexual or not, it has some power behind those words.”
For students with less time, Ga-
torWell provides another option: 
“Bringing in the Bystander.” The 
90-minute training teaches students how they can intervene. 
Students can apply for both pro-
grams online, but they have until Thursday to apply online for the Yes Means Yes seminar at gator-well.ufsa.ufl.edu/interpersonal-vio-lence-prevention.

High-risk drinking could lead to 
consequences that GatorWell wants to 
prevent.
According to NPR, colleges are advo-
cating cutting back on high-risk drink-
ing, as it may relate to sexual assault.
GatorWell wants students to be 
aware of the dangers of binge drinking.  
Maureen Miller, director of Gator-
Well Health Promotion Services, said 
there is a chance high-risk drinking and sexual assault are related.
“If you’re adding alcohol really into 
any situation, people’s judgments, their perceptions, their thought process — everything is impacted,” Miller said.
She said that trying to prevent stu-
dents from binge drinking is an ongoing 
cycle that will always need improve-
ment.
In the past, UF launched campaigns 
to prevent binging on alcohol.
GatorWell has used its “Less is 
More” campaign to emphasize the un-appealing consequences of drinking too much alcohol. The campaign was placed on the sides of Regional Transit System buses to inform students about the risks of alcohol consumption.
That campaign spurred the “When 
I Drink Too Much” campaign in 2009, with students anonymously telling their stories, in hopes to lessen high-risk drinking.
UF advertising senior Hillary Harper 
said she believes UF is making a great effort for these campaigns, but it is not advertised well.
“Especially in the recent events, 
they definitely should be putting up more posters, making sure students are fully aware of their surroundings at all times,” Harper said.Link between assault, binge drinking“You learn certain things

Rick Scott, GOP 
must confront   
climate change
For a long time, Republicans around the country were con-
tent to simply deny the existence of climate change.
In 2011, Gov. Rick Scott said, “I’ve not been convinced 
that there’s any man-made climate change... Nothing’s con-vinced me that there is.”
Even as recently as January, the 24 Republicans on the House 
of Energy and Commerce Committee voted against a measure that would have deﬁ  nitely stated the existence of anthropogenic climate change.
Now, in the face of overwhelming evidence that global 
warming is not only real but perhaps inevitable and irreversible, Republicans are starting to change their tune, if only slightly.
The new popular talking point among Republicans is some 
variation of “I’m not a scientist, therefore, I can’t say whether 
climate change is real or not.”
Scott has gotten in on the act, too. In May, when asked for his 
thoughts on climate change, Scott simply said, “I’m not a scien-
tist.” 
Most Republicans are not doctors or health care profession-
als, yet they have no problem claiming that the Affordable Care Act is a massive failure.
Most Republicans are not economists or tax experts, but that 
doesn’t stop them from claiming that massive tax cuts for cor-
porations and the wealthy will lead to economic prosperity, de-
spite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
And most Republicans aren’t women, but that doesn’t deter 
them from passing law after law to make access to reproductive health care more difﬁ  cult and expensive.
So, given the inanity and thorough ridiculousness of the “I’m 
not a scientist” trope, why are Republicans actually so deter-mined to avoid discussing climate change?
The answer is simple, if infuriating: The Republican Party is a 
wholly owned subsidiary of the oil and gas industries.
In just the past year, representatives of the energy industry 
have given more than $68 million in political contributions, with nearly 80 percent of that money going to Republicans.
Two of the top three beneﬁ  ciaries of this campaign cash have 
been from Speaker of the House John Boehner, R-Oh., and Sen-ate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. These two individ-uals largely direct the policy priorities of the entire Republican Party.
Next month, scientists and policymakers will be holding a 
conference in Tampa to discuss the issue of climate change.
According to the Hufﬁ  ngton Post, Scott’s spokeswoman 
Jackie Schutz said, “We think it’s a great idea for them to have a summit ... and we look forward to reading their report.” That kind of weak and halfhearted statement on climate change is ex-actly what Florida and the rest of the country cannot afford.
Climate change threatens both the environment and the 
global economy. Scott and other Republicans must break free from the corrupt stranglehold of the oil and gas industries and confront this critical issue before it is too late.

out a half was enough punishment for Jameis Winston?Today’s question: Would you vote for an independent 
student senate candidate?UF must improve tolerance of Islam
In continuing its efforts to strive “For the Gator Good,” UF announced earlier this year that it would be among the ﬁ  rst universities in the southeastern U.S. to open a Center 
for Islamic Studies.
This step toward tolerance and making all groups feel 
more welcomed on our campus should have been welcomed by all. Unfortunately, that was not the case.
Recently, an organization called the Coalition of Con-
cerned Citizens Group distributed propaganda that protest-ed the commemoration of UF’s new Islamic Studies center. The group attacked keynote speaker John Esposito and lik-ened him to Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, the leader of the terrorist group ISIS. The group called Esposito a “terrorist supporter” and spewed baseless claims about his personal character and history.
Our campus and and our nation are still feeling the lin-
gering effects of Sept. 11. One of the unfortunate but often forgotten remnants of this tragedy is the discrimination Mus-lims and dark-skinned Americans face on a regular basis.
The fear of terrorism — a fear fueled and fed by our na-
tion’s political leaders — has led some people to believe that all followers of Islam are enemies of Western ideals and threats to America’s  way of life. In the view of these individ-uals, a supporter of Islam is a supporter of terrorism — there is no difference, they say.
American Islamophobia has led to general discrimination 
of people with brown skin, even if they are not Muslim.
In a misguided attempt to guard its religion and way of 
life against an exaggerated and invented threat, the Coalition of Concerned Citizen Groups is attempting to infringe upon the rights of countless brown people in this nation. They seek to deny hundreds of thousands of Americans the right to practice their religion and to live their lives the way they see ﬁ t .
Outbursts of hatred and discrimination toward Mus-
lims have sprung up on college campuses across the coun-try. Soon after 9/11, Khalid Latif, Muslim chaplain at NYU, held a roundtable to discuss the adverse effects that the discrimi-nated Muslims faced in the 9/11 aftermath were having on the stu-dent population.
Notable issues were the per-
ceived inability “to worship freely at mosques” and the “deterred organization around Muslim civil 
rights issues.”
The problem with discrimination against Muslims and 
brown people extends beyond college campuses into all as-pects of American life. In 2012, a Wisconsin Sikh temple was attacked by a gunman who was an Army veteran with ties to white supremacist groups.
Racial proﬁ  ling, hate speech and violent attacks are a com-
mon thread in the dark history of the treatment of American minorities. Americans have a tendency to react with outrage and indignation against acts of terrorism and violence, while simultaneously oppressing and terrorizing members of mi-nority groups.
The Coalition of Concerned Citizen Groups should sub-
stitute the word “Concerned” in its title with the word “Fear-ful.” The driving force behind acts of hate is the fear of those who are different or unfamiliar.
The Coalition’s attempt to derail the conference support-
ing the launch of UF’s Center for Global Islamic Studies is proof that, even in Gainesville, there are people afraid of seeing Muslims gain equal footing with other American re-ligious groups.
UF’s goal of providing diverse cultures with a free, wel-
coming and accepting environment is congruent with its goal to become recognized as a top 10 university. The vitriol and hate of groups like the Coalition are a major obstacle to-ward that goal.

Stand against the Israeli occupation
Those speaking of academic freedom in 
relation to the academic boycott failed to men-
tion the lack of academic freedom that Pal-estinians are afforded when they are denied access, funding, materials and mobility by the 
state of Israel on a daily basis.
Why are Israeli universities being targeted? 
Israel is a rogue state actively engaged in the 
ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. Because Israeli universities are by and large administered by the state, we must assume that these universi-ties further the ends of the repressive regime.
In his letter to the editor, UF Hillel rabbi 
and CEO Adam Grossman made a comment about divestment being divisive. Was the 
Montgomery bus boycott divisive? Was the 
movement to divest from apartheid South Africa divisive? Yes, challenging systems of oppression can alienate those who defend the status quo and racism. Those who feel that the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement is divisive should look inward and ask why they feel the need to support the university’s endowment going toward further marginal-izing people here and abroad.
Nelson Mandela not only fought for libera-
tion for black South Africans but was also in solidarity with the Palestinian freedom move-ment, was labeled as divisive at the height of his activism.
Divestment is necessary for peace. By ceas-
ing to fund the occupation, the university lets us stop being complicit in the occupation. I encourage those who advocate for peace to follow through with their actions and stand 
against the Israeli occupation by supporting 
the movement.

Letters to the Editor
Last week, the U.S. Cen-
sus Bureau reported that the national poverty rate 
declined for the first time since 2006, down to 14.5 percent. The 
rate was 15 percent in 2012, so 
it would appear that the trend is moving in the right direction. However, these numbers are misleading.
While the poverty rate did 
go down, the details behind this are complicated. Even with the decrease in poverty, many 
social disparities still remain, 
including that the poverty rate is still extremely high compared to prerecession levels, and black and Hispanic families still have lower median incomes than be-fore the recession.
What’s most troubling is the 
fact that one out of five Ameri-
can children live in poverty. 
Another issue is that the 
methods the U.S. government 
uses to track the poverty rate may be flawed.
The approved measure of 
poverty was developed about 50 years ago by Mollie Orshan-sky, a Social Security Adminis-
tration official. Orshansky set 
poverty thresholds by devel-oping a typical family budget, which was based almost en-tirely on food and multiplying it by three.
This measure, adjusted for 
inflation, is still used by the government to measure pov-
erty today.
The problem with this meth-
od is that family budgets today 
are much different from family budgets in the 1960s.
The average family only 
spends about one-eighth of its budget on food, not one-third.
Other costs such as health 
care, child care and housing have gone up dramatically, but these costs are not appropriate-ly accounted for.
The current poverty for-
mula also assumes a national standard that does not consider different costs of living from state to state and different liv-
ing styles, such as rural versus 
urban. In addition, variances — such as taxes, deductions and government assistance like welfare and food stamps — are not calculated into the poverty measurement.
Clearly, the government is 
underestimating the issue of poverty in America.
If we used the same mea-
sures developed by other in-dustrialized nations, our pover-ty rate would increase by half. About 68 million Americans 
would be considered poor.
In 2011, the Obama admin-
istration released a new way of 
tracking poverty: the Supple-mental Poverty Measure. As an unofficial measure released sep-arately from the Census Bureau report, the measure accounts for government assistance and 
subsidized housing. It also ex-
cludes expenses such as taxes and work-related costs.
In 2012, the official measure 
of poverty was 46.2 million people, while the Supplemen-tal Poverty Measure was 49.1 million. Although the measure does a better job of giving a bet-
ter overall portrait of poverty, it 
is far from perfect.
If consumer expenditures 
in housing, utilities and food decline, then this measure de-clines as well, which can be problematic if a recession hits.
The measure gives us a bet-
ter understanding of what is 
really happening with poverty, 
but it still should not be entirely relied on.
Despite an extensive effort 
by the federal government, pov-erty in America is a persistent and significant issue. The war on poverty started 50 years ago, and since then, we have spent 
more than $22 trillion combat-
ing poverty, and no gains have been made.
We can’t expect poverty lev-
els to ever reach zero, but 8 to 12 percent is a realistic expecta-tion.
To achieve this goal, we 
need to improve our educa-
tional system, encourage an 
increase in family income and create high-paying full-time jobs rather than low-wage part-time jobs.
We can’t fix poverty over-
night, but we can’t even begin to solve the problem until we understand and measure it 
more accurately.

“Plastic surgery” is a seemingly harmless 
phrase that has the power to generate negative images almost instantaneous-
ly. These two words take us to “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” Hugh Hef-
ner’s living room or a Kardashian-esque reality show 
faster than you can say Botox.
Cosmetic surgery is defined as any procedure that al-
ters or enhances a certain body part and has been popu-larized in the media by what seems like an endless list of celebrities and public figures. But it’s not just the trophy wives of Hollywood who undergo these procedures. 
Last year alone, regular Americans spent $12 bil-
lion on surgical and nonsurgical cosmetic procedures. 
It sounds like everyone’s doing it. Yet, cosmetic surgery 
is often something people feel they need to hide and be ashamed of. 
In a progressive country, it does not make sense that 
such a stigma still surrounds what has ultimately been normalized in our society. Anyone who wants to alter or enhance a body part should have the freedom to choose cosmetic surgery without fear of embarrassment. 
Plastic surgery needs to be categorized differently 
because it is no longer reserved for celebrities who de-cide to change certain physical aspects on a whim every other day.
Cosmetic surgery is prevalent in our modern society, 
and instead of being shunned, people should be wel-comed and encouraged to finally feel good about them-selves in a way they might not have been able to before.
Think of it this way: A man or woman who buys and 
wears clothes flattering to his or her specific body shape 
and preference is not ridiculed for being “fake” by not 
showing the world every inch of skin. 
An individual might choose to follow the newest 
makeup fads, such as contouring and highlighting, in which larger parts of the face are minimized with a dark shadow (usually the nose) and smaller parts are enlarged with a brighter powder (the eyes) to create the illusion of a more symmetrical face. 
If all changes in appearance are meant to 
be made a mockery, why doesn’t society treat those who use makeup and dress for their body types in the same way popular culture shuns and scorns those who have gotten a nose job, face lift or breast augmentation? 
One aspect of cosmetic surgery that goes primarily 
unnoticed is the positive effects it can have on an indi-vidual. In a study from Ruhr University, Bochum, in Germany, researchers found that plastic surgery patients actually reported a happier, more fulfilled and enjoyable 
life after their operation.  
Researchers tested the patients before surgery and 
again one month, three months, six months and one year 
afterward. Reports showed that those who underwent cosmetic surgery felt less anxious and overall healthier than before the surgery. 
Whether you agree with the concept of cosmetic sur-
gery, those who choose it as a means to improve their quality of life should be able to do so without harass-
ment and judgment. No individual should have to hide 
something that makes them feel beautiful and healthy. 
Just like surgeries that directly impact one’s health, 
such as a lap-band surgery, cosmetic surgery can simi-larly affect both the mental and physical health of an in-dividual. Plastic surgery is a part of our society, not just a passing fad we see on TV.
The faster we can accept its existence in our lives and 
attempt to understand the reasoning behind the impor-
tant choice to undergo any given procedure, the more 
encouraging we can be for post-operation patients to gain confidence and happiness.

A troop of 11-year-old girls 
dressed in pink and green tradition-
al saris pranced on stage in front of more than 1,000 people in the Reitz Union on Saturday.
The performance was part of 
Praharsha 2014, an annual celebra-tion of Indian culture.
The event was held in the Reitz 
Union Grand Ballroom and brought together 12 acts by UF students, as well as other community members. It cost about $4,000 and was funded in part by Student Government.
The free festival was put on by 
Gators for Asha, the UF branch of Asha for Education, whose mis-sion is to promote socio-economic change through the education of underprivileged children in India. Gators for Asha, which means hope in Hindi, was founded in 2003.
“Education is one of the primary 
things that has to be given to a child,” said event coordinator Poojitha Sat-ti, a 25-year-old UF civil engineering graduate student. “That’s one of the main reasons that I’m involved in this organization.”  
Speakers remembered UF gradu-
ate student Krishnendu Saha, who drowned on Sept. 13, at the event.
Express, a student-based perfor-
mance group, sang a song in Hindi, 
accompanied by acoustic guitars 
in remembrance of Saha. He was scheduled to perform at the event.
UF’s No Southern Accent a cap-
pella group, several traditional Bharatanatyam dances and a fashion show were all part of the festival. 
A community band called ICEC 
Youth Group played an original 
piece on trumpets, saxophones and 
an electric drum set.
Satti and Gators for Asha co-
president Apoorva Mohan, 25, said they were both most excited for the Bollywood dances and the food ca-tered by Andaz Indian Restaurant.
Visitors came from around the 
state to attend the biggest Indian 
cultural festival on campus, such as 
Sue Rocher of Trenton, who works with several of the performers.
“I think it’s definitely a worth-
while event and something that is a great cultural experience,” she said.8, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 2014

The crimson pride at Har-
vard University will feature 
some orange and blue this weekend.
Two UF students, Frances 
Chapman and Katy Burnett, were selected by the Bob Gra-ham Center for Public Service to attend the “Bipartisan Advoca-cy: Finding Common Ground” conference held by the Harvard Institute of Politics.
This Saturday and Sunday, 
the students will participate 
in the conference focusing on 
campus political engagement, career development in public service and civic education.
“When I found out I was 
chosen, I was working on the Charlie Crist campaign in St. Petersburg,” said Frances Chap-man, a UF political science and 
Arabic junior. “I was excited to 
be able to bring what I was do-ing over the summer to the con-ference and my university.”
Chapman, 19, and Burnett, 
31, will work together to dis-cuss student voting rights and 
accessibility. They will collabo-
rate with other universities to make a plan catered to UF.
“This is not a regular panel 
where we just sit and listen,” said Burnett, a UF political sci-ence and history senior. “This conference is about action.”
UF is a part of the institute’s 
“National Campaign for Politi-cal and Civic Engagement,” a group of 25 universities around the country hoping to improve communities through politics and public service.
About 50 other national 
campaign school students will 
attend the conference.
Shelby Taylor, communica-
tions director for the Graham 
Center, said after the two stu-dents return, they will replicate it for UF students through a Florida-focused policy confer-ence. 
“I think it’s a great oppor-
tunity for politically motivated students at UF to meet with other engaged students across the country and share tips with one another,” Taylor said. “The point is to gain knowledge and be able to implement it.”
Attendees will create action 
plans, write blogs and share 
success stories based on issues 
proposed at the conference.
“There are phenomenal re-
strictions on registering people to vote,” Chapman said. “Being able to discuss and finally ad-dress this is very satisfying.”
One of the ideas Chapman 
and Burnett plan on proposing 
at the conference is an entirely 
online voter-registration plat-form.
“We’re working on the 
mechanical issues of voting because these are easy fixes,” Burnett said. “Getting students to the polls is harder, but if we make it easier to register, I be-
lieve we can have a huge turn-
out.”UF students to attend

Some students will do whatever they can to avoid 
emptying out their wallets for textbooks, even if it means 
downloading them illegally.
For students, textbooks can be a financial burden 
aside from paying for tuition. In  recent years, the cost of college textbooks has skyrocketed 82 percent between 2002 and 2012, according to the U.S. Accountability Of-fice.
Jessica Diaz, a  UF civil engineering junior, has paid 
about $250 for one textbook. She said she has heard of websites where students can access textbook PDFs ille-
gally.
“For me, I just find it’s easier to have a hard copy ver-
sion,” Diaz, 20, said.  “They are really expensive, but it’s 
still morally wrong.”
Unfortunately for local businesses selling textbooks, 
students getting their textbooks online for free could cut sales in the future.Doby Gray, manager of Gator Textbooks at 3501 SW 
Second Ave., said his business will suffer if more stu-dents choose to download illegal copies of textbooks.
“Right now, despite students finding other means for 
books, our sales stayed the same this year,” Gray said. “If more people find out about this, we would cry.”
Barbara McDade-Gordon, UF associate professor of 
economic geography, said textbooks cost too much for students.
“The point is to access information and knowledge, 
no matter how they get it, as long as it’s legal,” she said. “I don’t want students to do anything illegally, but the Internet makes information so accessible these days.” 
McDade-Gordon said there are other ways to get text-
books that are cheaper and legal, such as renting books and even buying used books from past students.
“Students just don’t have the money to be spending 
so much on textbooks, especially for just one semester,” she said.Illegal textbook downloads on the rise

Saturday Night Live fans will 
now be greeted by a new voice from 
The Gator Nation.
Darrell Hammond, a UF alum-
nus and former cast member of SNL, 
will replace Don Pardo as the “Live 
from New York, it’s Saturday night” announcer.
Hammond is set to take over 
the role this Saturday after Pardo’s death in August. 
Hammond graduated from UF 
in 1978 with a bachelor’s degree in 
advertising. He went on to portray Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Donald Trump 
and Sean Connery throughout his 14 years on SNL, becoming the show’s longest-running cast member from 1995 to 2009.
Since he left the 
show, Hammond has returned for several cameos, appeared in TV shows, movies and published a memoir titled, “God, If You’re 
Not Up There, 
I’m F****d.”
Michelle Bellaver, who has a 
master’s degree in theater from UF, 
said it’s great to hear about Ham-mond’s success on SNL. She signed with an agent in New York City and has been auditioning for roles since June. 
“UF has really supported me 
and my career,” she said. “They make sure that the graduates have a chance to showcase in New York 
right before graduation.”
Charlie Mitchell, an assistant pro-
fessor at UF’s School of Theatre and 
Dance, said Hammond’s success is a direct result of his hard work.
“Those who immediately ex-
pect recognition tend to fall away,” Mitchell said. “Hammond has al-ways given hard work credit for his 
career.” 
UF spokesman Steve Orlando 
expressed his support for Ham-
mond on behalf of the university in an email.
“It’s always great to see — and in 
this case hear — that The Gator Na-tion really is everywhere,” he said.UF alum takes over as SNL announcer

The Gator Nation is represent-
ed all across the country, but this 
summer, one UF student set out to prove it. 
In 13 weeks, Kyle Johnson, a UF 
electrical engineering senior, vis-ited 29 states with the Gator flag in tow. 
“I got the idea when I saw the 
picture of these people climbing a giant mountain,” the 22-year-old said. “Whenever they climbed the mountain, they pulled out a Gator flag, and I thought ‘Oh, this is pret-
ty cool.’”
During the summer, Johnson 
worked as an intern for the engi-
neering company CH2M HILL in Denver, Colorado. Some of his du-ties included working out-of-state with substations in New York, Colorado and remote oil fields in northern Alaska.
When he had time off from 
work, Johnson would spend it traveling, often stopping to snap photos with his flag. 
“Whenever the company sent 
me to different places across Amer-ica, I took it with me, and I showed it off all over,” he said.
Some of the places he visited 
with the flag include Mount Rush-
more and the Grand Canyon. John-
son said he visited Key West and Barrow, Alaska, because he want-ed to take the flag to the southern-most point and the northernmost point in the U.S.
Dan Nix, CH2M HILL principal 
engineer, was Johnson’s intern-ship mentor and supervisor over 
the summer. Nix worked closely 
with Johnson on his projects in Colorado and kept track of his out-of-state travels.“I thought he got bit by the 
travel bug pretty badly,” Nix said. “He really used this as a good base to see a lot of places.”
Johnson did not always travel 
alone. His longtime friend Jake Hemingway, 22, accompanied him on some of his trips in the south-western U.S. Hemingway said their trek to Mount Evans in Colo-rado was a difficult task. 
“We were coming down Mount 
Evans, and it was more or less iced 
over and more or less a 1,500- to 
2,000-foot drop,” the University of South Florida civil engineering senior said. 
Johnson does not plan on stop-
ping his travels anytime soon. Af-ter graduation, he plans to take his flag to San Francisco and Israel. 
“Without the education I got at 
UF, I would not be able to travel the way that I do,” he said. “I love The Gator Nation. It’s been a part of my entire life.”

Gainesville customers 
wrapped around the corners 
of Verizon Wireless early Fri-day morning, eagerly await-ing to buy one of two new iPhone models released this 
weekend.
The hype lasted through 
Sunday, when Gainesville 
residents Joseph Cesar and 
his girlfriend, Brenda Ba-
nales, browsed the Archer Road store, deciding wheth-er to upgrade to the iPhone 6 
or iPhone 6 Plus.
Though the release sales 
reached more than 9 million, 
Apple customer service rep-resentative Lindsey Straton said they did not surpass last year’s iPhone 5 model sales.
Banales said her biggest 
iPhone 6 selling point is the company itself — she’s been a loyal Apple customer since purchasing the first iPhone model. Her boyfriend, Cesar,  a self-proclaimed loyal An-droid customer and owner of a Samsung Note 3, consid-
ered making the switch.
“What I’m really looking 
forward to is the interface — 
being able to have my iTunes 
and all of that connected,” he 
said.
“With my Android, I have 
to purchase songs from Am-azon and download them to 
my SD card,” he said.
But not everyone is ready 
for the change.
“I believe that they are 
putting out ideas that have 
already been thought about,” said Steven Ortega, Android owner and AT&T customer. “They are just promoting it 
in a better light.”
Both local Verizon and 
AT&T stores declined to 
comment.iPhone 6, 6 Plus

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — One game after 
tying the school record for most receptions 
in a game and making his imprint as Flori-da’s go-to receiver, Demarcus Robinson was relatively quiet against Alabama on Satur-
day.
The sophomore caught the first pass of 
the game — a four-yard sideline pass from 
Jeff Driskel — but failed to make in impact on the boxscore for the remainder of the first half. Driskel targeted Robinson just four times in the first 30 minutes.
Robinson finished the game with two 
catches for 14 yards and was targeted on 
seven different occasions.
In addition to Robinson, Matt Jones had 
a subpar night.
After rushing for 156 yards against Ken-
tucky, the junior running back managed just 
37 yards on 12 carries.
Offensive line plagued against Ala-
bama: The injury bug hit the Gators’ offen-
sive line hard during Florida’s 42-21 loss to

Redshirt senior Chaz Green — who is 
starting at left tackle in place of the injured 
D.J. Humphries (ankle) — went down on just the second play with a right leg injury, but returned on the next drive. While he was off the field, Florida had David Sharpe and Rod Johnson — a true freshman and a redshirt freshman, respectively — manning both tackle spots.
Then early in the second quarter, starting 
right guard Trenton Brown was taken to the 
locker room with a high ankle sprain.

 A transfer and a walk-on lead their 
team to a four-set win.
And no, that’s not the beginning of a 
joke.
Senior libero Holly Pole and junior 
setter Mackenzie Dagostino created 
the momentum and plays to bring No. 7 Florida (6-3) to a 3-1 win on Sunday against Central Florida (7-5) after a 3-2 loss to Marquette (7-3) on Friday.
“Around the country this match won’t 
get as much attention as either of the wins did last weekend, but in our pro-gram, how huge this win was (for us),” 
coach Mary Wise said. “The preconfer-
ence season UCF played, the people they’ve beaten.”
Dagostino had another record-break-ing day after passing her career assists record 
with 58. Her work on 
assists kept UF in the 
game against a hard-hitting UCF team.
“When a team hits 
.350, your setters doing some good stuff,” Wise 
said.
The Tampa native also added three 
kills and two service aces on the day.
Assisting Dagostino in a dominant 
day was Pole, who tied her career record for digs in a match (20) and also had two service aces.
Wise said both Dagostino and Pole 
performed well leading the team from its loss on Friday to the win on Sunday.UF tops UCF in four setsALEX MAMINAKIS

 Despite what you may have heard, 
Florida did get a win in Tuscaloosa, Ala., 
this past weekend.
The No. 7 Gators soccer team (6-2, 1-0 
Southeastern Conference) beat the Crim-
son Tide (4-3-1, 0-1 SEC) by a score of 2-1 
on Friday night. 
It was the SEC opener for both clubs.
This was the first win for Florida at Al-
abama since 2008, and Coach Becky Bur-leigh knows it is a tough place to win.
“Well, I think to come out of this game 
with a win, we haven’t done that in a while here in Alabama,” Burleigh said. “So we’re very happy with that.”
If one were to just read through the 
statsheet, he or she would see that Flor-
ida had 20 shots while Alabama only re-
corded seven and would think this was an easy win for Florida. 
But make no mistake, the Crimson 
Tide gave the Gators just as good as a battle as they have seen all year.
All three of the game’s goals were 
scored within four minutes of each oth-er. 
Sophomore Liz Slattery gave Florida a 
1-0 lead in the 74th minute when Chris-ten Westphal sent a free kick from just outside of the 18-yard box that bounced around before Slattery put it in the back of the net. 
It was the sophomore’s first goal of 
the season.
“Christen (Westphal) served a great 
ball in,” Slattery said. “I got the first touch with my head, it bounced around in the box, and then me and this girl ba-sically kicked it in at the same time. It was a scrappy goal, but they all count the UF soccer defeats ‘Bama

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. — With 
Alabama’s 42-21 victory over Flori-
da, the Crimson Tide looks capable of winning both the Southeastern Conference title and earning a Col-
lege Football Playoff bid.
“We eventually got control of 
the game, which speaks a lot about 
the competitive nature that the players have,” coach Nick Saban said. 
“They just kept hanging in 
there. This is not something that we want to be a part of our team, in terms of how we execute and what we do.”
Alabama’s offense was bal-
anced against the Florida defense, as the Tide ran the ball well and quarterback Blake Sims had his 
first breakout game of the season. 
Sims, a senior in his first year as 
a starter, completed 70 percent of 
his passes for 445 yards and four touchdowns. 
His one interception came in 
the second half. 
“I thought Blake did a really 
good job on third down all day,” 
Saban said. 
“We had several third-and-
shorts, but we had some third-and-
longs that we converted. When Blake takes what the defense gives, he’s instinctive and he makes good 
plays and decisions.”
Sims left the game in the fourth 
quarter with a bruised shoulder, 
but Saban said Sims will be ready 
to play Alabama faces Ole Miss in 
two weeks.
“He made a couple of nice plays 
scrambling today, which is going to be a real asset for him,” Saban 
said. “People have to respect him 
as a passer. He has made too many plays and too many good throws for people to not respect him as a passer. He’s done a really good job 
for us.”
The Tide’s run game exploded 
in the second half, gaining 110 
yards on the ground and averag-
ing 5.8 yards per carry. Equally impressive in the sec-
ond half was running back Der-
rick Henry, whom Florida’s front seven had no answer for. Henry finished Saturday with 111 yards 
on 20 touches and a touchdown. 
“We were able to gain control 
of the line of scrimmage and were 
able to run the ball effectively,” Sa-ban said. 
“We made big plays on of-
fense; some of them were actually planned designs if they were in a certain look. We got the looks and 
we made big plays.”
Amari Cooper continued to play 
well on Saturday. After averaging 
151.3 yards per game through Ala-bama’s first three games, Cooper grabbed 10 passes for 201 yards 
against Florida.
Cooper was expected to be 
placed in man-on-man situations 
with cornerback Vernon Har-
greaves III. 
But the Gators defense gave 
him looks in zone coverage as well 
as safety reads. Cooper averaged 20.1 yards per catch and had three 
touchdowns. 
“Coop did a great job in the 
game,” Saban said. “We have a 
lot of respect for their No. 1 guy (Hargreaves III). He is a very good 
player. But when you have match-
ups like that with two good play-ers, I think when you analyze the whole thing; both guys will end up 
making some plays.”GRAHAM HALL

Though she hasn’t been on campus more 
than a month, freshman Lauren Brasure is 
leaving her mark on Florida’s cross country 
program early. 
She made a good start by winning the 
Mountain Dew Invitational on Saturday, 
breaking several records along the way to the 
first win of her young career. 
Brasure led the UF women’s cross country 
team take home the team title, eclipsing run-
ner-up Georgia Tech by 32 points.
Brasure shattered the Gators’ 5k Golf 
Course record with a time of 16:45.93. She was less than a second away from claiming the course record, held by Tennessee’s Patty Wiegand who finished with a time of 16:45.01 
in 1990. 
Redshirt freshman Becky Greene also im-
pressed in just her second race since arriving 
in Gainesville following a heralded running career in New Zealand. The 2014 Southeastern 
Conference Indoor Women’s Freshman Run-
ner of the Year spent much time with coach Paul Spangler on improving her endurance heading into the first 5k she had raced in the 
states. 
“She’s known more as a miler, so for her to 
come out and run that time is tremendous,” 
Spangler said. “Especially in just her second race.”
The team has relied on running together, 
which in turn pushes the Gators to run their hardest.
“It comforts me to know that I have team-mates so close who are working hard with me,” Brasure said. “We all work together and that definitely helps with the competitive-
ness.”
Taylor Tubbs, hoping to replicate the suc-
cess she saw at the Western Carolina Invita-
tional, finished behind her younger counter-parts as she came in third. While not the win 
she had been hoping for, Tubbs was still able 
to best her 5k personal record by nearly 31 sec-onds, finishing with a time of 17:07.57. 
While the women finished on top, the men 
were left wondering what might have been. Their top three runners of last year were in at-tendance, but did not contribute to the Gators’ scoring. Georgia Tech took home the team title, just the second time in 11 years that the 
UF men couldn’t win the singular home meet 
of their season.
Mark Parrish, who ran unattached after ex-
hausting his eligibility, claimed the men’s in-
dividual title in the 8k with a time of 24:04.78. 
Senior Eddie Garcia, also running unat-
tached, finished third while fellow senior Jim-
my Clark was held out with a sore back. 
While both seniors can still potentially 
compete for the Gators this year, Spangler is considering holding them out for the season to preserve their eligibility for next year. 
It’s a situation the team will continue to 
monitor leading up to the critical Wisconsin adidas Invitational on Oct. 17 in Madison. 
Behind the veterans, freshman Thomas 
Howell turned in a second-straight top-five finish, coming in fifth with a time of 24:45.76.
Finishing in the same ballpark as the her-alded former leaders of the team has given Howell the courage he needs if he hopes to compete as the third or fourth runner moving forward. 
“I didn’t really have any goals and expecta-
tions, I just wanted to run,” Howell said. “It’s an honor, and it gives me a lot of confidence going into the next races.”
Joining him in the top-15 were redshirt 
sophomore Mac Reynolds, who finished 11th, and redshirt junior David Kilgore who round-ed out the group in 15th. It was the first race for the Florida native, who transferred back to his home state after a roller coaster career at Colorado. 
Although Spangler was impressed with 
the performances of multiple members of the team, he knows the success of the team is reli-ant on their depth. 
“We had some guys who just didn’t step 
up today,” Spangler said. “Thomas coming in as a freshman, to run that fast in his first 8k that’s huge for him, but we have some guys that should have run better.”14, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 22, 2014

same.”
Senior Lauren Silver also added her first 
goal of the year for the Gators when her 
corner kick in the 78th minute went directly into the goal, giving Florida a 2-0 lead. 
But just seconds later, Alabama respond-
ed when senior Laura Lee Smith scored for the Tide on a one-touch finish past goal-keeper Taylor Burke.
The score held, and Florida would es-
cape Tuscaloosa with a win to begin its SEC schedule.
Alabama’s tough defense all night made 
it hard for Florida’s offense to find any sort of groove. 
To add, the Tide had quality opportu-
nities to capitalize on offense, including a shot that bounced off of the crossbar, but were only able to score the one goal.
This was, by no means, an easy win for 
the Gators.
“When they (Alabama) have eleven peo-
ple behind the ball at all times, it’s difficult. It’s hard to find space,” Burleigh said. “I thought we did some good things to score the two goals that we did.”
Friday’s game in Alabama was the sixth 
straight away game for Florida, which hasn’t played in Gainesville since Aug. 24 but will have two home games next week-end.
Burleigh said her team is excited to be 
playing back at home, especially since that means more practice time and less travel time.
“It’s been a long time since we played 
at home,” Burleigh said, “and I know our team will be very, very excited about that.”

Sophomore midfielder Liz Slattery dribbles the ball during Florida’s 3-0 win against Miami on Aug. 22 at James G. Pressly 
Stadium. Slattery opened scoring in Florida’s 3-0 win against Alabama on Friday in the 74th minute.“Holly and Mack are very different 
personalities, but they are the stabiliz-
ers for us, we know what we’re going 
to get from them,” Wise said. “Holly, 
her dig numbers, her passing num-ber, her two aces, she’s contributing in multiple ways. Mackenzie, she just 
makes plays that you combine her foot 
speed and her effort that allows her to make some elite plays out there.”
Pole’s efficiency came from being 
moved from backcourt to mid court 
more often. 
The libero had little production on 
the defense Friday night and found 
that the change in movement on the 
court helped her play better defen-
sively.
“It was a lot more moving me 
around,” Pole said. “I played some middle back, some left back, so (I was) 
just trying to be in the right spot and 
making plays from there.”
The Ocala native has played in the 
libero position since Florida faced 
Oklahoma on Aug. 30. She started 
against the Sooners behind senior Taylor Unroe as a defensive special-ist, and came back onto the court after halftime with the libero jersey on.
She hasn’t given up the position 
since.
Coming off of a big win against 
UCF will be useful for Florida going 
into Southeastern Conference play, 
Wise said.
Starting Friday, Florida starts SEC 
play against unranked Auburn.
Jordan McPherson / Alligator Staff
Mackenzie Dagostino (6) sets the ball during Florida’s 3-0 win 
against Idaho on Aug. 29 in the O’Connell Center. Dagostino set a career-high 58 assists in UF’s 3-1 win against UCF on Sunday.
Slattery scored first goal of season in Florida’s SEC-opening winfense suffered mightily because 
of it. The Gators averaged just 3.6 yards per play against the Crimson Tide after averaging 6.6 yards per play through its 
first two games of the season.
“It’s tough,” center Max 
Garcia said. “Because as the 
offensive line, you build chem-istry with those guys. All prac-tice you’ve been practicing with those guys right beside you … and it is a little difficult when you have a new guy in 
there, but when a man’s num-
ber is called, he’s got to be ready to play.”
Cummings continues to 
draw penalties: For the second straight week, Darious Cum-mings was at the center of a costly penalty.
In the second quarter and 
Alabama facing a second-and-7 from its 47-yard line, Cummings received a 15-yard penalty after he hit Crimson Tide quarterback Blake Sims after he ran out of bounds on a six-yard gain.
Alabama scored on a two-
yard pass to fullback Jalston 
Fowler four plays later to take 
a 21-14 lead.
In Florida’s 36-30 triple 
overtime win against Kentucky last weekend, Cummings was penalized for grabbing run-ning back Braylon Heard’s facemask during the second overtime period.
The Wildcats scored a game-
tying field goal four plays later to force a third overtime pe-
riod.
Christy adding to punts:  
Kyle Christy averaged 52.7 
yards on seven punt attempts against Alabama. 
On his final punt attempt, 
the senior booted a kick 66 yards, one yard shy of his ca-reer high of 67 set against Au-
burn on Oct. 15, 2011. 
Christy is now averaging 
50.4 yards per punt on the sea-
son.
Notes: Florida’s longest 
play of the game was Driskel’s 28-yard touchdown pass to Valdez Showers to tie the game at 7-7 in the first quarter. 
-All 21 of the Gators’ points 
against the Crimson Tide came off of turnovers. 
-For the second time this 
season, Clay Burton led Flori-da in receptions. 
The senior tight end caught 
three passes for a team-high 33 yards.  
-Redshirt sophomore Alex 
McCalister recorded his sec-ond sack of the season during the third quarter against the Crimson Tide and is now tied with linebacker Neiron Ball for the team lead.

TURNING POINT
After Florida tied the game at 21-21 with 12:42 remaining in the third quarter, 
Alabama went on a 16-play, 66-yard drive that ended in a Derrick Henry rushing 
touchdown. The drive encompassed almost half of the third quarter and saw 
the Crimson Tide convert three third downs — including moving the chains on a 
third-and-23 with a short pass to Henry for 29 yards.
Keanu Neal DB (3 points) - Neal 
was responsible for Florida’s 
lone big play of the game against 
Alabama. The sophomore safety 
forced and recovered a DeAndrew 
White fumble and returned it 49 
yards for a touchdown, giving Florida its lone lead of the 
contest.
After rushing the ball just seven times 
in Florida’s first two games, Jeff Driskel 
used his legs against Alabama and 
it paid off. The redshirt junior tied the 
game at 21-21 with 12:42 left in the third 
quarter and a 14-yard quarterback draw 
up the middle.
While Florida’s offensive line 
was rusty and dealt with injuries 
against the Crimson Tide, Garcia 
continued to be Florida’s work
 -
horse along the offensive line. 
The redshirt senior anchored an 
offensive line that allowed just four tackles for loss and three 
quarterback hurries throughout the game.
Derrick Henry made Florida’s defense 
miss tackles on more occasions than 
one. With Alabama facing a third-and-23 
and the score tied at 21-21, Sims com

and a first down.

pass from Sims to running back Ke-
nyan Drake on Alabama’s ﬁ  rst of-fensive snap, the Gators redeemed themselves on their next defensive drive.
On the ﬁ  rst and only play of the 
drive, safety Marcus Maye stripped the ball from Drake and Vernon Hargreaves III jumped on it to give Florida the ball back just one play af-ter punting it back to Alabama.
UF tied the game up three plays 
later with a 28-yard Driskel touch-down pass to Valdez Showers.
Alabama began to storm down 
the ﬁ  eld on its next drive, accumu-lating 31 yards on three plays. Then Neal forced Crimson Tide wide re-ceiver DeAndrew White to cough up the ball. Neal recovered the fumble and returned it 49 yards for a touchdown, marking the longest 
fumble return for a touchdown since 
Kiewan Ratliff had a 77-yard return against Florida State in 2003.
“Just try and score,” Neal said. 
“That’s all that was going through my mind.”
Alabama scored 14 unanswered 
points on a 79-yard Sims pass to Cooper and a two-yard touchdown 
pass from Sims to Jalston Fowler to 
take a 21-14 lead into halftime.
Florida looked like it could turn 
its game around when the third quarter began.
On the ﬁ  rst drive of the second half, UF linebacker Antonio Morri-son intercepted a Sims pass tipped by Neiron Ball and returned it 20 yards to the Alabama 16-yard line.
Driskel used his legs to score two 
plays later, taking a quarterback draw up the middle for a 14-yard score to tie the game.
That was the last sound heard 
from Florida in the game.
The offense shut down, gaining 
just 79 more yards for the rest of the game and failing to make it past the Alabama 49-yard line.
Driskel ﬁ  nished the game 9 of 
28 for 93 yards, one passing touch-down and two interceptions, and UF averaged just 3.6 yards per play after averaging 6.6 yards through its ﬁ  rst two games.The defense was picked apart, 
unable to get off the ﬁ  eld when it had several opportunities to do so. UF played 87 downs on defense compared to UA’s 55.
“That’s hard doing that at any 
time with any defense at any level of play,” linebacker Jarrad Davis said. “But if you want to be a great de-fense or you want to be a team that wins a lot of games, you have to be able to step up when your number’s called.”
After Florida tied the game, Ala-
bama went on a 16-play, 66-yard drive that ended on a 3-yard Derrick Henry touchdown run.
The Crimson Tide converted ﬁ  ve 
third downs on the drive — includ-ing a third-and-23 that saw Henry slice and dice Florida’s defense for 29 yards.
“We had plenty of opportunities 
to get off the ﬁ  eld on third down but we didn’t,” Muschamp said. “The 
ﬂ  are screen hurt us. They pinned the 
backer on that situation, so a combi-nation of those things.”
Heading into their bye week, the 
Gators have questions they need answered, and they need them an-swered soon.
“We need to make some adjust-
ments defensively with what we do 
moving forward,” Muschamp said. 
“We need to execute better on the of-fensive side of the ball and we have to stay balanced and get off the ﬁ  eld on third down. That was just a killer for us.”
