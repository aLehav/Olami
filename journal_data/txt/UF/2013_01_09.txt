The search has been suspended: 
President Bernie Machen isn’t leav-
ing UF right now.
This decision comes after re-
quests from Gov . Rick Scott and UF Board of Trustees Chairman David Brown, according to a statement re-
leased Tuesday afternoon.
“President Machen has earned 
a reputation for visionary think-
ing and has a record as a change agent,” Scott said in the statement. 
“I have asked him to continue his 
service as president, and I look forward to working with him, the Board of Governors and the Board 
of Trustees on this effort to realize a 
new vision for higher education in Florida.”
Brown referenced the university 
administration’s goal to move UF 
into the top 10 public universities 
as ranked by U.S. News and World Report. UF currently ranks No. 17 among public universities.
“Making UF a top 10 university 
has been my highest priority over the course of my tenure at the Uni-versity of Florida,” Machen, who took ofﬁ  ce in 2004, said in the state-ment.  “Now we stand at a cross-
roads where we have the potential 
to make giant strides. I have been asked to remain in ofﬁ  ce to lead that effort, and I am pleased to do so.”
Those involved with the presi-
dential search were set to interview candidates this weekend.
“I can see why the governor 
would want him to stay,” said Stu-
dent Body President Tj Villamil. “I 
think it’s a compliment to Bernie and all the great things he’s done.”
Faculty Senate Chair Cheri Bro-
deur said UF has become a better university with Machen’s ideas.
“It’s the right thing to do at this 
time,” she said. “You need a strong president to move up. A new presi-
dent coming in would take a while 
to get up to speed, and we won’t have to do that with President Ma-chen.”
Gainesville Mayor Craig Lowe 
agreed that the news was great.
“I hope that it would be matched 
by a commitment on the part of the state to fund the University of Bernie Machen will stay as university president

Numerically, diversity on UF’s cam-
pus has remained consistent over the 
last few years. However, a recently pub-lished study found colleges nationwide are becoming increasingly segregated.
Research presented Friday at the an-
nual American Economic Association meeting illustrated the diversity slow-down.
The research, which studied about 40 
years of data from most colleges in the U.S., found that segregation on college campuses isn’t dropping as quickly as it did in the 1960s and 1970s. It also found 
that states that ban afﬁ  rmative action 
have been reducing segregation.
Florida is one of the states that does not have afﬁ  rmative action, according to the research report. UF’s Director of In-
tercultural Engagement Jarrod Cruz said 
the university does not have a diversity quota to meet but does work within the state’s government policy.
He said UF strives to be inclusive and 
appealing to a variety of students.
“We consider ourselves to be one 
of the most diverse universities in the country and deﬁ  nitely in North Florida,” 
Cruz said.
According to the university’s Fall 
2012 enrollment summary, about 58 
percent of the 32,776 undergraduate stu-dents are white. Hispanic students made up about 18 percent. Black or African-American students, Asian students and Study shows colleges’

Turlington coupon books will no longer 
need to be thrown in the trash.
Instead, they can be recycled into bags to 
hold groceries as part of a new initiative to 
make Alachua County greener.
On Monday, Alachua County Waste Man-
agement announced new items for the county’s curbside recycling program.
The additions include paperback items, 
such as books and school workbooks, that can be disposed into county-provided orange bins.
Gable top cartons, used to hold juices and 
milks, and aseptic cartons, which hold nonre-
frigerated liquids, can now be placed in blue bins for plastics, according to a waste manage-
ment press release.
Residents can start recycling these items im-
mediately through the curbside program or at rural collection centers.
Milton Towns, a waste collection manager 
for Alachua County Public Works Waste Man-agement Division, said the county worked with the curbside recycling program, the SP Recy-
cling Southeast LLC and WCA Waste Corpora-
tion to expand the recyclable items accepted for waste collection.
“We try to look at what kind of items in our 
garbage we can pull out rather easily,” he said.
All the new recyclable items will contribute 
to other paper products such as grocery bags and rolled paper, Towns said.
The programs worked with processors and 
the Carton Council for about a year to ﬁ  nd a stable market to send the gable top and asep-tic cartons. New processes in the production of paperback books lead to the addition of those items, he said.County adds new recyclable

not patented and was made 
by many companies at the time.The sisters’ case is the first to go to trial out of scores of similar claims filed in Boston and around the country. They are seeking unspecified damages. A total of 51 wom-

ing in U.S. District Court in Boston against more than a dozen companies that made or marketed the drug.DES, or diethylstilbestrol, was prescribed to millions of pregnant women over three decades to prevent miscar -
riages, premature births and other problems. It was taken off the market in the early 1970s, after it was linked to a rare vaginal can-cer in women whose mothers used DES.Studies later showed the drug did not prevent miscar -
riages.The Melnick sisters, who grew up in Tresckow, Pa., say they all developed breast cancer in their 40s after their mother took DES while preg-nant.Their lawyer, Aaron Levine, told the jury their mother 
did not take DES while preg-
nant with a fifth sister, and that sister has not developed breast cancer.“What are the odds of that happening in nature if DES wasn’t the culprit?” Levine said.The companies that make 
DES argue no firm link has 
been established between breast cancer and the drug.

others each comprised about 8 percent. These num-
bers only vary slightly with Fall 2010’s enrollment summary.
In Fall 2008, the numbers showed white and 
black students accounted for a higher percentage of the undergraduate population. About 63 percent of the 34,654 undergraduate students were white, and about 10 percent were black or African-American.
All races and ethnicities are self-identified by 
students, Cruz said.
Industrial and systems engineering junior Ranjit 
Vadlamannati, 19, said he thinks basing acceptance 
on qualifications makes UF’s admissions process 
fair.“I don’t think UF is doing anything wrong,” he 
said. 
Christina Chang, a 21-year-old zoology junior 
and president of the Chinese American Student Association, thinks UF appeals to different kinds of people.
While at UF, she said she’s seen Asian, Caribbe-
an, Hispanic, African-American and some religious 
group organizations around campus regularly.
“Student organizations that are multicultural 
promote diversity,” Chang said.
She said she believes segregation is not the 
prominent issue but rather the fact that discrimina-
tion and prejudice in schools still exist.
“UF is a higher-ranking institution,” she said. 
“People who want to continue their education don’t always worry about ethnicity.”JENNA LYONS

Michael William Kri-
esel dreamed of saving the 
wolves out west. 
He was one step closer 
to his goal after completing his first semester at Santa Fe College Teaching Zoo.
His classmates said they 
“never saw the guy without a smile.”
Kriesel died Sunday 
morning when his car veered 
off Interstate 95 and crashed 
into the concrete base of a highway sign. 
Authorities pronounced 
him dead at the scene. He was 22.
Joseph Cambareri, Krie-
sel’s best friend, said Kriesel left at about noon Saturday 
for Florida after spending 
the holiday with his family in New York.
Cambareri said he be-
lieves Kriesel drove for about 17 hours without sleeping and may have fallen asleep 
at the wheel.
Cambareri and Kriesel 
met at an audition for “Les 
Miserables” about eight years ago and have been 
friends ever since.
The two shared a love 
for a capella music, but they 
didn’t always see eye to eye 
on movies. 
Kriesel liked to watch 
low-budget horror films for fun.
Before attending Santa 
Fe, Kriesel lived in Syracuse, 
N.Y. 
He graduated from 
Fayetteville-Manlius High School in 2008 with Cam-bareri. 
Later, he studied at the 
State University of New York at Potsdam before working at a dog training business.
Kriesel was one of about 
120 students enrolled in the 
zoo animal technology pro-
gram at Santa Fe, said Jona-than Miot, director of the teaching zoo.
After his death, Kriesel’s 
classmates met Sunday night to light candles and share stories of experiences in the program with him.
“We all really admired his 
energy,” said Elena Almas, a 35-year-old student in the program. “He was just that kind of guy.”
“He was a good student. 
He was always eager to learn,” said Miot, who taught Kriesel. “The thing I remem-ber most is that he always 
had a smile on.”
Kriesel always had a 
sense of adventure, Cam-
bareri recalled, saying he remembered when the two 
went cliff jumping with 
friends and when they set off their own fireworks during a Fourth of July celebration 
last year.
Kriesel is survived by his 
parents, two older sisters and a younger brother.
A funeral is scheduled 
for Kriesel on Friday at Im-
maculate Conception Parish in Fayetteville, N.Y.
Cambareri started a Fa-
cebook page in Kriesel’s honor.  
As of press time, the page 
had about 700 likes.  
Cambereri said he 
wouldn’t forget Kriesel’s sig-nature voice.
“When he talked, it didn’t 
sound like anybody else,” he said. “When he talked, I knew I should listen.”4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 9, 2013

Gainesville Police is looking for a man con-
nected to a Monday night robbery at a Kan-
garoo Express gas station on West University Avenue.
At about 11:20 p.m. Monday, the man 
walked into the gas station, on the 900 block of West University Avenue, and told the ca-shier he had a weapon, said GPD spokesman Ben Tobias.
The man stole the money from the cash 
register and fled from the store, running north on Northwest 10th Street.
When police arrived at the scene, a GPD 
K-9 unit searched the area but could not find 
the man, Tobias said.
He added that the man waited for all the 
store’s customers to leave before he walked 
up to the cashier.
A GPD news release described the man to 
be 20 to 30 years old with short, brown hair.
A surveillance video showed the man 
walking into the store wearing a black cap, gray flannel shirt, gray pants and white ten-
nis shoes during the robbery.
If you have any information about this 
case, please contact GPD detectives at 352-
393-7670 or text “GPDFL” plus your tip to 274637.

UF’s University Gallery opened a new ex-
hibit Tuesday featuring the work of New York 
artist Elena Sisto.
The artwork collection, called “Between 
Silver Light and Orange Shadow,” is about 
becoming an artist and being of college age, 
said Amy Vigilante, director of the University Galleries at UF.
”It’s young and fresh,” she said.The portraits feature artists, including 
many of Sisto’s own students, Vigilante said.
Sisto plans to visit UF at 6:30 p.m. Thurs-
day in Fine Arts Building B, where she’ll dis-cuss her career. Sisto’s exhibit will run through 
Feb. 1, Vigilante said.
Two of UF’s other galleries, the Focus Gal-
lery and the Grinter Gallery , will also open new exhibits this week. All three galleries will 
be open to the public Friday for a reception from 7 p.m.  to 9 p.m., Vigilante said.
Grinter’s display , called “Traces of Ink and 
Brush,” shows works of calligraphy, she said.
The Focus Gallery, which opens today, fea-tures ceramics made by the UF group HOT Clay, said exhibit curator Danielle Bowman, a 23-year-old second-year museum studies graduate student.
The exhibit is about the end of the world, 
she said.
“It’s a student-run show,” Bowman said. 
“There’s a variety of artists that are involved, which means that it’s a variety of work in-volved.”UF art galleries receive new exhibits for the new year

Florida at the appropriate level,” he 
said.
Much of the student response 
was positive. Finance freshman Tempris Barrett, 18, said she’s glad Machen will stay. Solansh Hernan-dez, a 19-year-old psychology soph-
omore, agreed.
Health science freshman Jena 
Broyles, 18, said she thought the 
search was taking a lot of effort.
“They kept sending emails and 
didn’t have many answers,” she said.
English professor Scott Nygren 
said he’s concerned the governor may have overstepped by making the request for Machen to stay. But he called the news a promising de-
velopment.
“Machen has 
been arguing for a long time that 
UF needs and 
deserves greater 
recognition and support for the 
potential it has to 
be a top 10 university in this coun-
try,” he said.

Students will have a place to meet 
after hours at a 24/7 student center 
to be established at Newell Hall.
Senate President Christina Bonar -
rigo announced at Student Senate 
Tuesday that funds were secured for 
the new center.
The renovation will cost $13 
million. The money was gathered from the same pool of student funds used for the Reitz Union makeover, Bonarrigo said after the meeting.The project is waiting for final 
approval from the Board of Gover -
nors, which should take place Jan. 16, Bonarrigo said after the meeting.
The UF Board of Trustees offi-
cially approved the renovation of Newell Hall into a study center last 
month.
Bonarrigo told the Senate that she 
would like to see a plan for Newell 
Hall in full motion before the end of the semester.
“It would be an amazing addi-
tion to campus,” she said.
After the meeting, she said Stu-dent Senate will gather student input and ideas for the new study center.
“We want to make sure that’s 
represented in the final plan of the building,” Bonarrigo said.
Newell Hall, which is listed in the 
National Register of Historic Places, was home to the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.
A plan to renovate it was intro-
duced in 2009 but dropped due to lack of funding.

� HE IS NOW THE SEVENTH CANDIDATE.
JENNA LYONS
Alligator Contributing Writer
A former city commissioner filed paperwork Friday 
with the Alachua County Supervisor of Elections to run 
for mayor, making him the seventh candidate in the race.
Ed Braddy , 40, now joins Scherwin Henry , Peter Lars 
Johnson, Donald Shepherd Sr., Mark Venzke, Edward Young and incumbent Mayor Craig Lowe in the race for the mayor position this spring. Ramon Trujillo, a former candidate, withdrew from the race in June.
Braddy served as a city commissioner for District 2, 
which consists of northwest Gainesville, from 2002 to 
2008. He said he worked with other commissioners to 
reallocate existing revenue toward road maintenance and to improve the equipment and response times for the city’s police and fire departments.
He is the director of the American Dream Coalition, 
a group that pushes for individual freedom, property rights and less con-gested roads.
Braddy also co-hosts “Talk of the 
Town,” a radio show on The Star 99.5 that discusses local issues. He will step down Jan. 17 because federal 
law requires radio stations to provide equal time for candidates within 60 days of an election.
For his mayoral campaign, Braddy said he wants to 
deliver affordable services, reduce resident utility bills and improve transportation to reduce traffic congestion in the city.
“I believe my platform is responsive to the needs 
of the people and reflective of what most people want, 
rather than the elite vision of the political establish-
ment,” he said.Newell Hall study center funds secured

Electricity is nonexistent, residents are rebuilding a city they 
once knew and a dark figure schemes to sabotage progress.
This is an alternate Gainesville portrayed in a series of books 
titled “Elotchaway , or, How It Will Be.” The works are written by a 
local writer and sold at businesses within the city.
In the series, set in the near future, society in Gainesville has 
completely collapsed, said Jim Chapin, editor of the series.
“The idea is that things have gone somewhat wrong,” he said. 
“Basic infrastructure doesn’t exist, and it’s all about people coping, people finding new forms of living and new ways to be happy.”
The series’ author, Tom Sims, and illustrator, Cincinnati K., use 
pseudonyms to mask their identities, a decision that will draw readers to the story rather than who created it, Chapin, 25, said.
The author and illustrator were unavailable for comment. 
Chapin said he won’t be the one to reveal their identities.
Currently, the books are sold at Karma Cream, The Bull and the 
Midnight because of the lack of local bookstores, he said.
“When you look at Gainesville, we are in kind of a lull of private 
bookstores,” he said. “There really aren’t any.”
The first book in the series came out in August. Chapin said a 
fifth book will be released next week.
Chris Kane, a 24-year-old Starbucks employee, handles book 
distribution with Chapin.
Payal Patel, owner of Karma Cream, said she is satisfied with 
the book being sold in her store.
“I love that there is cooperation with local artists,” she said.Alternate Gainesville

OPINIONS EDITORToday’s question: Do you think Bernie Machen should 
stay as UF’s president?
99 TOTAL VOTES91% YES
9% NOTuesday’s question: Do you think text-book prices are too high? In 2009, when the auto industry was still ﬂ  oundering, 
politicians believed they could help automobile manufac-turers and the environment while stimulating economic 
activity in the midst of the economic downturn through a program called “cash for clunkers.”
It sounded like a good plan.The government would provide monetary rebates for 
consumers to trade in older, harmful emission-emitting au-tomobiles for the purchase of newer, fuel-efﬁ  cient cars.
Like many , if not most government economic stimulus 
programs, what sounded like a beneﬁ  cial government policy on the surface created disastrous unintended consequences. Predictably, cash for clunkers was an absolute failure.
Frederic Bastiat’s broken window fallacy posits a scenario 
in which a rufﬁ  an throws a brick through the window of a bakery. While this might seem like a destructive activity, modern intellectuals — including the likes of Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman — argue that this commo-tion gives the town’s window maker means for employment and is fundamentally good for the town’s economic growth.
But before subscribing to this logic, one must recognize 
the difference between the seen and the unseen. While we might see economic activity created on behalf of the window 
maker, the money the baker might have spent on another 
economic activity — such as purchasing a new suit — now has to be spent on a new window.
In “Economics in One Lesson,”  Henry Hazlitt argues, 
“Instead of having both a window and a suit he [the baker] must be content with the window and no suit.” Furthermore, the tailor, who would have been employed in the creation of a suit for the baker, now loses any potential income in this situation. The tailor could have spent the money from 
the sale of the suit on further economic activity, stimulating 
more growth and so on and so forth.
Under the cash for clunkers program, a similar scenario 
emerges. What other economic activities would those who traded in their cars have engaged in had it not been for the program’s incentive to purchase a new car? The possibilities are practically endless.  
Despite not actually stimulat-
ing economic growth when factor-
ing in the unseen costs, the pro-
gram was also wasteful.
According to analysts at Ed-
munds.com, an online automotive information resource, about 82 
percent of the 690,000 cars sold during the cash for clunk-ers program would have been sold anyway had the program not existed, costing the taxpayers $24,000 per vehicle sold.
To make matters worse, an article by TakePart.com found 
that the cash for clunkers program actually had a negative impact on the environment. Instead of recycling certain parts of the cars traded in during the program, the government or-dered that engines immediately be destroyed and that other parts be shredded after 180 days, putting “polyurethane foams, metal oxides, glass and dirt” into landﬁ  lls, according to the website.
Because the program decreased the supply of available 
used cars, the prices of other clunkers were artiﬁ  cially in-
creased, hurting those who wanted an affordable used car, 
as well as hundreds of independently owned used-car deal-erships.
Due to the government’s intervention, the economy expe-
rienced no real growth, resources were directed away from otherwise productive activities, the supply of used cars was diminished, the environment suffered and lower-income in-dividuals were given fewer options for affordable transpor-tation.
Worst of all, the disastrous results of these types of pro-
grams are easily predictable based on sound economic logic — if only politicians had any.
Justin Hayes is pursuing a master’s degree in political com-
munication. His column appears on Wednesdays.Financial results of ‘cash for clunkers’ 
were harmful and also predictableHeat Wave to Hell: 
You’re making the 
Earth too hot
Global warming is happening. Now please get over your-
selves before we all die.
Sure, we escaped the narrow clutches of a Mayan-
predicted apocalypse, but that doesn’t mean we can just live willy-nilly and ignore the actually serious problems that plague 
our planet.
Call it whatever you feel like, but literally, the Earth is warm-
er than it used to be. There are more people, cars, technology , 
etc. than there used to be, so it’s probably safe to assume that all of us have something to do with it.
Buckle up, folks, because you’re in for a sweaty and destruc-
tive ride. We realize that we live in Florida, a state that sees pret-ty mild or nice weather most of the time, but haven’t you noticed that our seasons are blending into one, dumb summer with little 
dips called “spring” and “sort-of winter?”
In 2012, the lower 48 states saw the hottest temperatures on 
record. Yeah, there aren’t any records before there was the tech-
nology to properly measure it in, like, 1850, so, just deal with that part.
Katharine Hayhoe, director of the Climate Science Center at 
Texas Tech University, said in a CBS News article that tempera-tures are rising faster than scientists predicted.
“A picture is emerging of a world with more extreme heat,” 
said Andrew Dessler, a Texas A&M University climate scientist, according to the article. “Not every year will be hot, but when heat waves do occur, the heat will be more extreme. People need to begin to prepare for that future.”
Things are happening, and they will continue to happen fast-
er unless we put forth any effort to try to help the situation. We’ll put it into terms that you might understand.
Let’s say you got a new kitten. Congratulations! But you’re 
pretty busy between your classes and homework, plus you just 
landed a cool new job, so you’re not necessarily home all the 
time to properly take care of it. At ﬁ  rst, it starts acting out in cute little ways that are more adorable than threatening, like trying to trip you while you walk. When it starts to poop in your bathtub or shred your curtains, that’s when you ﬁ  nally take notice and start to do something.
That’s what the Earth is doing now. It’s pooping in our bath-
tubs and shredding our curtains for the sake of getting noticed so we can ﬁ  x its problems. “YOLO” also applies to the planet, 
you guys, not just your outlook on partying.
We’ve only got one Earth, and it’s heating up faster than sci-
entists predicted it would. It’s diseased and infected, and it’s our 
fault. Stop denying that climate change is happening.
“These records do not occur like this in an unchanging cli-
mate,” said Kevin Trenberth, head of climate analysis at the Na-tional Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., in the article, “and they are costing many billions of dollars.”
Now you’re not only dumb, you’re also being cost-inefﬁ  cient. 
Some of you will scoff and say that energy-smart resources cost a 
lot of money, too. The difference is in the sustainability aspect of 
things. Yeah, they might cost a little extra right now, but they’ll 
also help the planet live longer. Suck it up.

I read a lot. It’s my escape, like wearing a pair of 
meggings (man leggings).
Or like reading while wearing a pair of meg-
gings.
Every year I look forward to the newspaper or 
magazine articles and TV shows that recap the high-lights, as if they think Americans suck at remember-
ing things.
Which we do.
My favorites are the ones that highlight words 
and phrases. Y’know, the words and phrases that are overused, often stupid? Then, they ban them — as 
they should.
We should start treating people like we treat 
words. If we can ban the stupid things people say, 
then wouldn’t it just make sense to ban the stupid 
people?
Warren Buffett: He’s a pinhead. And had we 
rolled off the “ﬁ  scal cliff,” he would have been in the 
driver’s seat, steering the banned wagon. 
To recap, Buffett’s one of the wealthiest schlubs 
on the planet — next to Al Gore after he sold Current TV to Al Jazeera.
Before the tax hikes, of course.Buffett also believes the wealthiest aren’t paying 
their fair share, but his secretary is. 
He pounded that statement harder than the U.S. 
Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, while receiving more support from the White House than the U.S. Consul-ate in Benghazi did.
For the record, he makes his money off invest-
ments.
Buffett is taxed at the 15 percent cap gains rate, 
which recently went up. 
Unlike his secretary, however, he’s effectively 
taxed twice: once on his income and once on his in-vestments. 
Theoretically, he likely paid 35 percent on his orig-
inal income, invested the remaining 65 percent and paid an additional 15 percent on any capital gains. 
In other words, he paid his fair share, whether he 
thinks so or not. In double other words, he can get lost — or write a check to the federal government.
Or both.    Sandra Fluke: She’s a whine ball. Before graduating cum laude, Fluke attended 
Georgetown University Law Center. Georgetown, a private university, is the oldest Jesuit school in the 
U.S. 
It’s afﬁ  liated with the Roman Catholic Church, 
which means birth control is a no-no, which means 
it’s not covered under their health plan.Which sucked for Sandra.But that didn’t stop the 
then 30-year-old law student 
from voicing her opinion, 
demanding the religious in-stitution’s insurance policy pay for birth control.
To wrap things up, un-
like the Catholics, asking a 
private Catholic university to provide birth control is like asking the Hare Krishnas to serve meat, Chick-ﬁ  l-A to stay open on Sundays or Satchel’s to accept 
credit and/or debit cards.
If they don’t cater to your needs, then ﬁ  nd a new 
caterer. It’s not their problem. 
It’s yours.      PSY: He’s anti-American.  
Or “was” anti-American.I hope he disappears like the Dixie Chicks.Rob Parker: He’s a racist, sort of. Parker’s the black ESPN commentator who asked 
Robert Grifﬁ  n III if he was a “brother” or a “cornball brother.”
Apparently, RGIII is a Republican who has a 
white ﬁ  ancee, which to poopheads like Rob Parker, is 
probably worse than a white woman whose ﬁ  ance is 
a black Republican. 
One would think RGIII beat the hell out of his 
dogs.
But he didn’t.
And it’s not just the jerks like Parker who I’m re-
ferring to. It’s the people who can say whatever they 
want about whoever they want because they’re like 
them — sort of. 
Because they’re black, or a feminist, or a peace nut, 
or a greenie, “the rules of hypocrisy are suspended,” 
wrote Greg Gutfeld in “The Joy of Hate: How to Tri-
umph Over Whiners in the Age of Phony Outrage.” 
“Crusading as a phony bleeding heart allows you to be a real-life asshole.”  
And it’s true. These people include: comedians like Bill Maher 
and Jimmy Fallon, journalists like Ed Schultz, poli-
ticians like Barney Frank, commentators like Kenny 
Mayne and athletes like Mike Tyson.
In closing, let’s ban them all and send them to an-
other country. 
Like France. 
Or California.
Erik Skipper is an economics sophomore at UF. His 
column runs on Wednesdays.A list of characters who should 
be banned from 2012 recognitionColumn
When Democrats call for broader levels of gun control, 
they’re potentially cashing in on a political winner.
Most people — including this gun-loving, former 
National Riﬂ  e Association member — recognize, or at least are beginning to acknowledge, how unnecessarily dangerous as-
sault riﬂ  es and oversized clips are. But let’s not kid ourselves 
into thinking an assault weapons ban or a clip size limit will substantially reduce gun violence.
Though mass shootings have the unique ability to capture 
national attention, they account for a small fraction of yearly gun deaths.
Last year, guns killed 31,347 American civilians. About 80 
died in mass shootings, and the most liberal estimates available claim only a few thousand gun-related deaths were a result of 
assault weapons. (These weapons most likely account for less 
than 1 percent of gun violence.)
Even in the recent Newtown tragedy, the shooter had more 
than enough guns to use if his Bushmaster .223 caliber Reming-ton semiautomatic weapon had not been available. Renewing some version of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban would be a great start toward preventing certain kinds of gun violence, but let’s not consider it anything beyond a start.
What else has been proposed?
Some Republicans have called for more guns; others have 
noted that more concealed carry permits would lead to fewer 
mass shootings, and that’s right. If the principal at Sandy Hook Elementary had a gun, lives could have been saved. The same goes for those present in the Aurora theater, the Sikh temple and the Tucson “Congress on Your Corner” event.
This view, however, ignores the more important studies that 
ﬁ  nd a positive relationship between gun ownership and gun 
violence in the United States; saving 10 
lives in a mass murder isn’t worth los-
ing 15 lives in a dark alley.
America might be better served if 
politicians heeded the oft-uttered man-
tra, “Guns don’t kill people, people kill people.”
International evidence conﬁ  rms many countries, unlike the 
United States, have lots of guns and relatively few murders and vice versa. (Look at Switzerland.)
While there may not be a correlation between some nations’ 
gun ownership rates and their gun violence, there seems to be a common cause that increases the lethality of this combination in America: culture. The issue is not easy access to guns but is instead our desire to obtain and use them. Any attempt to limit gun ownership merely provides a temporary, patchwork solu-tion.
At the same time, there’s a lot we can do to reduce gun vio-
lence — we don’t simply have to throw our hands in the air and accept it.
Criminologists have identiﬁ  ed a number of factors that no-
ticeably increase violent crime: racism, gender inequality , bad parenting, bullying, alcohol use, lack of mental health treat-ment, income inequality and so on. In relation to the rest of the industrialized world, America scores quite poorly on many of these indicators. Not surprisingly , our ﬁ  rearm-related deaths are much higher than Europe’s.
The government cannot play Big Brother and try to ﬁ  x all of 
these issues — many are beyond its scope or ability to ﬁ  x. But 
let’s stop pretending guns are the main issue.
Anyone truly interested in reducing gun violence shouldn’t 
write their congressman or woman asking for gun control but 
instead should request universal health care, better public schools, less public worship, expanded welfare programs, an Equal Rights Amendment, etc. Rarely , if ever, do advocates of a safer society bring these issues to the forefront; they seem un-doubtedly partisan and unrelated to the problem.
America has developed a culture of fear and violence. Cana-
da has gun laws as lax as ours, yet they have signiﬁ  cantly lower rates of gun violence.
Some cultural differences may remain forever embedded 
in American society, but following Canada’s lead in address-ing the needs of the underprivileged could do more than any increase in gun control. Though another assault weapons ban is probably a good idea, it won’t go far enough toward solving the real issue.
We cannot end violence with one bill, but we can begin to 
address gun violence by recognizing our societal ﬂ  aws and pushing for broader public policy changes.

Gainesville Police is looking for a man accused of 
shooting at a group of people outside a Butler Plaza movie 
theater early Monday morning.
No one was hurt during the shooting.The incident started after Zairon Jarquis Fussell, Rob-
ert Nathaniel Morris and Morris’ friend walked into a late-night showing of “Texas Chainsaw 3D” at the Regal Gainesville Cinema Stadium 14 movie theater, located on the 3100 block of Southwest 35th Boulevard, according to a GPD arrest report.
Micca Gamble, a 19-year-old College of Central Florida 
student, said she was sitting with a group of friends in the theater when Fussell, 19, started accusing someone in the group of tripping him while he walked in the aisle.
Gamble said she and her friends denied tripping Fus-
sell, but he kept accusing them before the movie started.  
During the movie, Fussell told Morris to get a gun from 
Morris’ house, according to the report. 
Morris left the theater and returned with a gun.Gable said Morris was gone for about 10 minutes before 
returning to the theater.
After the movie ended, Fussell and Morris continued 
the argument outside in the parking lot with Gamble and her friends, Gamble said.
“We told him, ‘You’re not going to do nothing, so just 
drop it,’” she said.
Fussell pulled out the handgun and fired a single shot 
at the group.
Gamble and her friends took cover behind cars in the 
parking lot. Amber Richardson, one of Gamble’s friends, called police.
“It was like, ‘What the hell just happened?,” Gamble 
said.
Fussell fled from the parking lot while Morris and his 
friend drove away, according to the report.
Later that night, Morris returned to the parking lot, 
looking for Fussell. 
A GPD officer at the scene pulled him over during a 
traffic stop, according to the report.
Gamble and her friends identified Morris as one of the 
men involved in the shooting.
Police arrested Morris and charged him with four 
counts of attempted murder and one count of conspiracy to commit murder, according to the release.
During questioning with detectives, Morris and his 
friend identified Fussell by his driver’s license photo-graph.
The friend told police he knew Fussell had a bad tem-
per and had been known to snap, according to the report. 
Morris told officers he left the theater to retrieve the 
gun for Fussell.
Police later booked Morris into the Alachua County Jail 
at about 9 a.m. Monday. 
As of Tuesday night, he was still in custody with an 
$825,000 bond.
Police are still looking for Fussell, who also goes by “Z 
Man.” 
He is a 6-foot 1-inch black man with a medium build 
and multiple tattoos. 
Police said he is considered armed and dangerous, ac-
cording to the release.

Police search for

gunman remains 
shot in the dark� AUDIOLOGIST AND SEAMSTRESS/TAILOR 
ALSO MADE THE LEAST-STRESSFUL LIST.
JENSEN WERLEY
Alligator Contributing Writer
A ranking has named higher education professors 
the least stressful job for 2013, much to the outrage of 
academia.
CareerCast.com created a ranking of the 10 Least 
Stressful Jobs for 2013. The list includes seamstress/ tailor, medical lab technician and audiologist as some of America’s least stress-producing jobs.
“The field’s high growth opportunities, low health 
risks and substantial pay provide a low-stress envi-ronment that’s the envy of many career profession-als,” the website reported on professors.
In a Forbes article regarding the ranking, Susan 
Adams explained professors are the least stressed of professionals because they get long breaks throughout the year, make a comfortable salary, enjoy good work conditions and often don’t have strict deadlines, even when they are on track for tenure.
Kim Walsh-Childers, a UF journalism professor, 
was not impressed by the reporting done on the sto-ry.
“It just sounds to me like the original organization 
that did the ranking didn’t really check their facts and made assumptions,” she said.
Faculty Senate Chair Cheri Brodeur was also not 
amused.
“There is no way we have the least stressful job,” 
she said. “We are trying to get out information to stu-dents, do research, are losing funding in every direc-tion and are trying to do the best job possible.”
Brodeur said UF faculty and professors are often 
on the cutting edge of information in order to give stu-dents the best education possible. That includes teach-ing themselves so they can better teach students.
She said a reporter would have no idea how stress-
ful the job was because they have never been in the 
shoes of a faculty member.
“There are a lot of distinguished professors,” Bro-
deur said. “They didn’t get there by not being stressed 
out.”
Kim McCall, a lecturer at the UF William and Grace 
Dial Center for Written and Oral Communication, said there is stress in unexpected places.
McCall worries about the students and is concerned 
when they don’t come to class.
“I have had two students pass away over the 
years,” she wrote in an email. “One passed away dur -
ing Spring Break, so I am always worried over the break and thankful when all the students return.”
Although not a professor, Mary Roca, a 22-year-old 
first-year English master’s student, desires to be one and feels that the website didn’t consider the times that professors work outside of teaching.
Despite the potential stress level, she said she and 
others like her desire to teach because they love the academic community and learning more.

Students reenact the old UF tradition of the impromptu pajama parade, which 
freshmen would participate in, for a Reese’s video. Reese’s is visiting campuses across the country to make videos about college traditions.
COLLEEN WRIGHT
Alligator Writer
A production team contracted by Reese’s 
will be on campus for the next two days to 
highlight the sweet past traditions of UF.
Freshwire, the production team, arrived 
on campus Tuesday to ﬁ  lm short videos on school spirit, featuring the “F Book.” 
The “F Book” has traditions Florida stu-
dents should complete before they graduate.
The team will also be ﬁ  lming at the Gators 
men’s basketball game against the University of Georgia tonight.
Cicerones and “F Book” co-chairs Chel-
sea Nesbeth, a 19-year-old animal sciences sophomore, and Spencer Smud were two of about six volunteers dressed in Gator gear in the videos.
“We’re always happy to promote the tra-
ditions at the University of Florida,” said Smud, a 21-year-old recreation, parks and tourism senior.
Smud said Reese’s contacted the UF 
Alumni Association, which put the company in contact with the Cicerones, as the “F Book” falls under its jurisdiction.The crew visited the Stephen C. O’Connell 
Center, the 34th Street Wall and the French 
Fries near Marston Library, according to the 
Reese’s Facebook page.
Reese’s will visit other schools to make 
videos about their traditions, but the list has 
not been ﬁ  nalized yet, a production member 
said.
Twenty-two-year-old political science se-
nior Justin Bullard traded his Gators jersey for pajamas during the video shoot. 
He partook in a mock parade through 
Turlington Plaza chanting “It’s great to be a 
Florida Gator.”
Bullard described the experience of being 
in the video as delicious.
“It’s delicious because I love Reese’s,” he 
said.

Whether it is a building ﬁ  re downtown or a chemical explo-
sion in a UF laboratory , Gainesville Fire Rescue ﬁ  reﬁ  ghters are 
always on the move.
With Gainesville Fire Rescue on constant alert for emergen-
cies, the department will give city residents and students an 
opportunity this March to spend a day in a ﬁ  reﬁ  ghter’s shoes.
Gainesville Fire Rescue announced Tuesday that applica-tions for the department’s Second Annual Gainesville Fire Res-
cue’s Citizens’ Fire Academy are now available, according to a GFR news release.
It is free to apply , and applicants must be at least 18 years 
old. The form must be submitted to Gainesville Fire Rescue by Feb. 7. Only 20 people will be accepted into the academy.
The event, which will run from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. March 9, will 
give participants a glimpse into the life of a ﬁ  reﬁ  ghter.
For the entire day, participants can work with GFR ﬁ  reﬁ  ght-
ers in several exercises, which include handling a ﬁ  re hose, cut-ting open a car and working with medical equipment, all while 
wearing safety equipment, according to the release.
Krista Gonzalez, Gainesville Fire Rescue’s risk reduction 
specialist, said the academy will be held in the spring rather 
than summer because of the heat.
“We are hoping that by holding the event in March, the 
participants will get the same experience, but be a little more comfortable,” she wrote in an email.
Applications are available online at www.gfr.org.Contact Chris Alcantara at calcantara@alligator.org.Gainesville Fire Rescue to give residents chance to feel the heat

For Florida, the memory 
of last season’s road loss to 
Georgia is still fresh. 
During the 76-62 upset on 
Feb. 25, defensive errors and a lack of intensity doomed the Gators. Bulldogs guard 
Kentavious Caldwell-Pope 
notched 18 points on 8-of-13 shooting as UGA shot 52.9 percent from the field.
The loss was Florida’s 
third-largest margin of defeat last year. 
Senior guard Kenny Boyn-
ton said the UF coaching staff 
often reminds him of the loss.
“They got us last time,” 
Boynton said. “But it’s a new 
year.”
No. 11 Florida (10-2) be-

The Gators will be tasked

Pope, who has emerged as the Bulldogs’ go-to scoring op-
tion this season. The 6-foot-5 
sophomore leads the team in points (17.5), rebounds (7.2) and steals (2.3) per game.
“He’s really a talented 
guy,” UF coach Billy Dono-van said. “The one thing that is really impressive about him is he has great size. He’s got great length. He can really score.”
Donovan said Caldwell-
Pope fell under the radar last season because SEC fresh-men such as Florida’s Brad Beal and Kentucky’s Anthony 
Davis and Michael Kidd-
Gilchrist dominated the spot-light. 
“(Georgia coach) Mark 
(Fox) does a great job of put-ting him in situations and 
taking advantage of his talent 
and his skill set,” Donovan said. “He clearly has emerged as one of the better players in 
our league.”
Caldwell-Pope is the epi-
center of Georgia’s offense. 
According to KenPom.com, UGA uses him on 27.2 percent 
of its possessions and scores 
28.8 percent of the Bulldogs’ points. The sophomore guard averages 33.5 minutes per 
game – 9.7 more than the next

When Crimson Tide coach Nick Saban 
raised the crystal football above his head, 
the Southeastern Conference made history.
 Alabama’s 42-14 victory against Notre 
Dame on Monday night in the BCS Nation-al Championship Game put the SEC at the 
top of college football for a seventh straight 
season.
However, the league’s football prowess 
has not rubbed off on men’s basketball this season.
The SEC’s 118-58 non-conference record 
is one of the worst among the major confer -
ences this season. The league ranks seventh in KenPom.com conference efficiency rat-
ings, compiled by averaging the ratings of 
each team in a league.
“Clearly up to this point in time, our league has had some difficult and challeng-ing losses. We all have,” coach Billy Dono-van said.
“I don’t think you take our league and 
just put it in a box and say the league is not as good because I think teams are going to get better. They are going to improve.”
Donovan said that one 
of the reasons the SEC is not one of the nation’s  toughest conferences is because people overlook 
the numerous coach and 
player departures. 
Last year, the SEC had 
the most NBA draft picks

Kentucky. 
During the offseason, 
South Carolina hired Frank Martin, LSU hired Johnny Jones and Mississippi State traded Rick Stansbury for 
Rick Ray — a first-year 
coach.
The beginning of the 
2012-13 season also brought departures for the SEC. Mis-
souri guard Michael Dixon  
was kicked off the team on Nov. 29 after two sexual as-sault claims surfaced, and Florida forward Cody Lar -
son, who decided to transfer 
on Oct. 26.
Still, the SEC started the 
season with Kentucky, Flor -
ida and Missouri ranked in the AP Poll.
Now only the No. 11 
Gators and the 10th-ranked Tigers remain. The Wildcats 
are unranked, dropping out from their preseason No. 3 ranking due partly to their 0-2 record against ranked op-
ponents. 
 The SEC began confer -
ence play with a 3-13 record 
against top-25 teams.
“There are a lot of dif-
ferent elements that go into this right now that you have 
players plugged into differ -
ent roles and positions they 
have never been in before,” Donovan said. “It takes time 
for guys to adjust, get bet-
ter and figure out what they need to do and that is what the schedule is for: to con-tinually get better.”
Florida begins SEC play 
tonight against Georgia at 7 in the O’Connell Center. The Bulldogs have one of the 
worst records in the confer -
ence at 6-7. Georgia is one of 
four SEC teams sitting at or 
below .500. 
Still, Donovan thinks it’s 
too soon to judge the SEC’s 
slow start.
“I’m all for the resume and 
the whole body of work,” Donovan said.
“But where that is some-
what flawed for all of us as coaches and teams is, what about the improvement that 
a team makes over the course 
of a year? It is like people talking on Selection Sun-day, ‘Well, back in Novem-
ber they lost this really bad 
game.’ Well … that was four months ago. The team could have gotten better.”

kagostin@alligator.org.Lewis missed 30 games during 2011-12
Cooper has been sidelined with 
a foot injury since a 98-67 loss at Florida State on Nov. 15. 
Needles is 32 of 87 from behind 
the arc, a team-leading 36.8 per -
cent clip. She is fourth on the team in scoring, averaging 8.4 points per contest. 
While spending a season on the 
sidelines, Needles developed an appreciation for Lewis’ determi-nation. 
As a freshman in 2010, Lewis 
played in just 16 games, muddling 
through multiple leg injuries be-
fore missing UF’s final 19 games. She suffered a stress fracture in her leg last season and received a medical redshirt. 
“Just being a redshirt with 
[Lewis] last year was really hard seeing her having to sit twice,” Needles said. “She’s really grate-
ful to be out on the court right 
now, and she is trying to bring her athletic ability.”
As the Gators marched toward 
the postseason in 2012, Lewis and Needles were joined by a common frustration with their inability to contribute on the court. 
The two often sat near each oth-
er on the bench, offering encour -
agement to one another and hop-ing for a chance to one day make 
an impact on the floor. 
“You never are ready for an in-
jury,” Lewis said. “Being injured 
two years in a row, you always are on the defense, always ready for something bad to happen.”
But a year later, the two finally 
have the opportunity to help Flor -
ida. 
In a 77-72 victory against LSU 
on Sunday, UF lost senior forward Jennifer George, who suffered a dislocated right shoulder late in 
the second half.  
Lewis and Needles, along with 
Jaterra Bonds, responded by carry-
ing the team to a significant win. 
“Carlie, Jaterra and Kayla ... 
were our core tonight,” Butler said after the victory. “They did a great job of sustaining this through a lot of different ups and downs, and 
that’s important.” Finally healthy, Lewis antici-
pates improvement individually and as a team. 
“A lot of people have been 
excited to see me play and be 
healthy,” Lewis said.
“This is just the tip of the ice-
berg. I’m expecting a lot of myself, and I know my coaches and team-mates are (as well).”

Yeguete likely to replace Murphy in starting lineup tonight
Although more than half of Caldwell-
Pope’s field goal attempts have come from 
behind the arc this season, he has made 
51.8 percent of his two-point field goal at-
tempts.
Boynton said he and junior point guard 
Scottie Wilbekin will alternate defending 
Caldwell-Pope.
“Me and Scottie will try to pressure him a little bit and play help defense,” Boynton 
said. “That’s the main thing we have to do: make him take the tough twos.”
Offensive balance has been a problem 
for the Bulldogs this season. Caldwell-Pope 
is the only Georgia player to average dou-
ble-digit points. 
The Bulldogs are riding a four-game 
winning streak, but five of their seven loss-
es have come against unranked teams.
“They were losing to teams. I don’t know how,” Boynton said. 
“Honestly, before this sea-son, I thought they’d be good. So, I respect Geor -
gia.”
UF will not be at full 
strength in its revenge ef-fort.
Senior power forward 
Erik Murphy (fractured rib) is doubtful for tonight’s contest, Donovan said Monday. Junior forward Will Yeguete is the most likely candidate to occupy Murphy’s spot in the starting lineup. 
Yeguete missed last season’s meeting 
against the Bulldogs in Athens, Ga., with 
a fractured left foot, but the loss still reso-
nates with him. 
“Georgia gave us a hard time last year at 
their place,” Yeguete said. “I wish I could 
have been there, but we have to use that as 
motivation and play well against them.”DefenSe , from page 13

  When history looks at Florida’s 2012 sea-
son, coach Will Muschamp will undoubtedly 
be remembered as the Gators’ savior — and deservedly so.
  In just his second year on the job, he 
brought a reeling college football superpow-er — gutted and abandoned in 2010 by Ur-ban Meyer — back to prominence.
  A major factor in Florida’s success is Mus-
champ’s commitment to special teams and the work of special teams coordinator D.J. Durkin. Before I continue, let’s step back a bit.
  One of the keys to Meyer’s success at UF 
was his penchant for special teams. From 2005-2010, Florida was the scariest team in 
America on fourth downs and kickoffs.
  Kicking the ball to Brandon James was 
like sticking a fork in an electrical socket. You 
did it once, and it shocked the stupid out of you.
  The legs of Gators like Eric Wilbur,  Joey 
Ijjas, Chas Henry and Caleb Sturgis came 
through on the rare occasions when Tim 
Tebow, Percy Harvin and the high-powered UF offense did not.  When kicking and punting, the opposi-
tion battened down the hatches. A storm was 
coming.
  In ﬁ  ve seasons with Meyer calling the 
special teams, Florida blocked 26 punts 
and ﬁ  eld goal attempts. Jarvis Moss’ “‘Cock Block” preserved the Gators’ 2006 national title run.
  So when Durkin took over for Meyer as 
the special teams coordinator in 2010, expec-tations were unbelievably high and not at all tempered. But the former Bowling Green de-
fensive end never wavered.
  He picked up right where Meyer left off.
  In Durkin’s ﬁ  rst two seasons running the 
Gators’ special teams unit, Florida blocked 10 punts and kicks. Henry won the Ray Guy Award in 2010. Sturgis was a semiﬁ  nalist for the Lou Groza Award in 2011. Andre Debose set a school record with three career kickoff returns for touchdowns.
  In 2012, the Durkin-directed unit reached 
new heights. Special teams won multiple games for the Gators this season.
  When Florida’s offense struggled early in 
a 14-6 win against LSU on Oct. 6, punter Kyle Christy pinned the Tigers inside their 
own 10 three times. 
LSU went three and out on each posses-sion, totaling only 14 yards on nine plays. In an intense battle for ﬁ  eld posi-
tion, Christy gave UF a crucial edge.
  In a 44-11 blowout victory against South 
Carolina only two weeks later, three of Flor-
ida’s four forced fumbles came on special 
teams plays.
  Loucheiz Purifoy made the special teams 
play of the year in Florida’s 27-20 win against Louisiana on Nov. 10. Purifoy blocked a Ragin’ Cajuns punt that Jelani Jenkins re-covered and returned 36 yards for the game-winning touchdown with two seconds left in regulation.
  Purifoy’s blocked punt was one of the 
Gators’ Southeastern Conference-leading six blocks this year, marking the third straight season UF led the league in that category.
  Florida forced ﬁ  ve fumbles and recovered four on special teams.
  Sturgis was again named a Lou Groza ﬁ  -
nalist, and Christy, a Ray Guy ﬁ  nalist, was passed over for an award he deserved. Even a terrible season did not stop Debose from upping his kickoff return touchdown record to four.
  Much was wrong with the way Meyer ran 
the program during his six-year tenure. But Durkin has done a great job implementing one of Meyer’s better coaching philosophies — emphasizing and prioritizing special 
teams.
  Durkin told players before the season be-
gan that those not willing to play on special 
teams were selﬁ  sh.
  He used positions on special teams to re-
ward effort and hard work.
  “Anytime you’re a gunner or you’re re-
ally doing anything on special teams, it’s an honor,” quarterback Jeff Driskel said on Oct. 
22. “They take great pride in that.”
  As long as Durkin is at Florida, the Gators 
can take great pride in their special teams.

org.   With only 7 minutes of game 
time separating the Crim-son Tide from a second 
consecutive national championship, A.J. McCarron and Barrett Jones 
were pissed. 
  Alabama was facing 2nd-and-6 
from its own 29-yard line and pro-
tecting a 28-point lead. 
  With the play clock running 
down to about 3 seconds, Jones mis-takenly paused to identify a Notre Dame shift. Behind him, McCarron lost his mind. He frantically signaled 
for a timeout — a request that went 
unanswered as the referees ﬂ  agged Alabama for delay of game. 
  McCarron then stomped over 
to Jones and shouted at him.  Jones promptly shoved McCarron aside.  
  On the 
s i d e l i n e , coach Nick 
Saban was 
incensed. He cast his h e a d s e t aside and turned red 
from the strain of screaming at a group of ofﬁ  cials who likely didn’t understand why a man moments 
from winning his third national title 
in four years was so upset.   But the two facts aren’t unrelated. 
  Alabama is on another level. Pro-
grams like Florida strive to emulate Saban’s model, but each still has a long way to go. By a combination of attitude, talent and approach, the Crimson Tide is miles ahead of its 
nearest competition. The Gators are 
on the way, but a few critical faults are holding them back. 
  Alabama’s championship is the 
seventh in a row for the Southeast-ern Conference, but this isn’t an SEC thing. The SEC doesn’t have The Process, a Saban staple explored by Sports Illustrated as part of its 2012 
college football preview edition.
  At its core, The Process is pretty 
simple. Every person in the Ala-
bama organization has a strictly reg-imented and clearly deﬁ  ned sched-ule. Each of them is always focused solely on their next task — the thing they can control. In general, control-ling wins, losses and championships is impossible. Instead, the focus is 
working hard in everything you do 
and taking life one day at a time. The Process is a focus on just that, the process of doing what it takes to be successful, not the results. 
  Now that the game is over, Sa-
ban plans to take 24 hours off before picking up right where he left off in recruiting, stringently following 
the 18-month calendar that details 
everything everyone in the orga-nization needs to accomplish. The Process is a focus, a professional attitude and a lifestyle that comes down to one simple message: “Do Your Job.” Saban adopted the motto from Bill Belichick and constantly preaches it to Alabama’s players.   In 
the south end zone meeting room 
in The Swamp, Florida coach Will Muschamp posted a sign bearing the same message. 
  After working with Saban for ﬁ  ve 
years at LSU and with the Miami Dolphins, Muschamp brought The Process to Florida. The evidence is everywhere. Like Saban, Muschamp 
run an aggressive 3-4. Both coaches 
have a blueprint for what players at every position should look like, 
down to size, character and the oth-
er “critical factors.” 
  But a few steps remain.  Florida was trailing Louisville 30-
10 with about 8:45 to go in the fourth quarter of the Sugar Bowl. On 2nd-
and-5 from UF’s 12-yard line, Domi-
nique Easley tackled Jeremy Wright for a loss of 1 yard. After the stop, Easley took the opportunity to yap into Wright’s ear. 
  Two Louisville possessions earli-
er, with UF still down 30-10, Michael Taylor tackled Wright for a gain of 1 on 2nd-and-6 from the Florida 
20-yard line. After the stop, Taylor 
leaped to his feet to pump up the crowd as Easley pumped his ﬁ  st.
  Neither play forced a punt, and 
both came more than 50 yards and eight plays into a Louisville drive. UF had nothing to celebrate.  
  After Alabama’s 42-14 disman-
tling of Notre Dame, linebacker Nico Johnson told ESPN that he was 
disappointed the Crimson Tide al-
lowed a touchdown. 
  After UF’s loss in the Sugar Bowl, 
Sharrif Floyd was asked what he’ll remember most about his last colle-giate game. 
  “I blocked another ﬁ  eld goal,” 
Floyd said, laughing as he recalled the play that gave him an excuse 
to charge off the ﬁ  eld triumphantly 
with his chest puffed out even as UF’s deﬁ  cit remained a still-hope-less 20 points. 
  Contrast that approach with Ala-
bama’s Jones and McCarron, who, playing with a comfortable lead in a much bigger game, needed to 
iron out the issue that led to a delay 
of game. Never mind that the Tide could have taken a delay of game ev-ery snap the rest of the way and still won comfortably , or that Jones and McCarron will never again play to-gether. They needed to get it right, to prepare for the next task rather than dwell on what they’d accomplished. 
That’s the difference between Ala-
bama and everyone else. 
  While Alabama strives for per-fection, Florida will celebrate being on the receiving end of the biggest upset in BCS bowl history . 
  Maybe changing a team’s attitude 
takes time. Or maybe Muschamp 
isn’t even trying — no evidence says 
a team can’t win a title with an at-titude, and Muschamp wouldn’t be wrong to put his own emotional, trash-talking stamp on UF. 
  But as Alabama continues to rack 
up titles and build a dynasty , maybe it’s fair to wonder if anything other than The Process is the wrong way 
to go.

 Special teams coordinator key to UF’s turnaround seasonSEC schools — six came from 
Kentucky. 
During the offseason, 
South Carolina hired Frank Martin, LSU hired Johnny Jones and Mississippi State traded Rick Stansbury for 
Rick Ray — a first-year 
coach.
The beginning of the 
2012-13 season also brought departures for the SEC. Mis-
souri guard Michael Dixon  
was kicked off the team on Nov. 29 after two sexual as-sault claims surfaced, and Florida forward Cody Lar -
son, who decided to transfer 
on Oct. 26.
Still, the SEC started the 
season with Kentucky, Flor -
ida and Missouri ranked in the AP Poll.
Now only the No. 11 
Gators and the 10th-ranked Tigers remain. The Wildcats 
are unranked, dropping out from their preseason No. 3 ranking due partly to their 0-2 record against ranked op-
ponents. 
 The SEC began confer -
ence play with a 3-13 record 
against top-25 teams.
“There are a lot of dif-
ferent elements that go into this right now that you have 
players plugged into differ -
ent roles and positions they 
have never been in before,” Donovan said. “It takes time 
for guys to adjust, get bet-
ter and figure out what they need to do and that is what the schedule is for: to con-tinually get better.”
Florida begins SEC play 
tonight against Georgia at 7 in the O’Connell Center. The Bulldogs have one of the 
worst records in the confer -
ence at 6-7. Georgia is one of 
four SEC teams sitting at or 
below .500. 
Still, Donovan thinks it’s 
too soon to judge the SEC’s 
slow start.
“I’m all for the resume and 
the whole body of work,” Donovan said.
“But where that is some-
what flawed for all of us as coaches and teams is, what about the improvement that 
a team makes over the course 
of a year? It is like people talking on Selection Sun-day, ‘Well, back in Novem-
ber they lost this really bad 
game.’ Well … that was four months ago. The team could have gotten better.”

kagostin@alligator.org.Lewis missed 30 games during 2011-12
Cooper has been sidelined with 
a foot injury since a 98-67 loss at Florida State on Nov. 15. 
Needles is 32 of 87 from behind 
the arc, a team-leading 36.8 per -
cent clip. She is fourth on the team in scoring, averaging 8.4 points per contest. 
While spending a season on the 
sidelines, Needles developed an appreciation for Lewis’ determi-nation. 
As a freshman in 2010, Lewis 
played in just 16 games, muddling 
through multiple leg injuries be-
fore missing UF’s final 19 games. She suffered a stress fracture in her leg last season and received a medical redshirt. 
“Just being a redshirt with 
[Lewis] last year was really hard seeing her having to sit twice,” Needles said. “She’s really grate-
ful to be out on the court right 
now, and she is trying to bring her athletic ability.”
As the Gators marched toward 
the postseason in 2012, Lewis and Needles were joined by a common frustration with their inability to contribute on the court. 
The two often sat near each oth-
er on the bench, offering encour -
agement to one another and hop-ing for a chance to one day make 
an impact on the floor. 
“You never are ready for an in-
jury,” Lewis said. “Being injured 
two years in a row, you always are on the defense, always ready for something bad to happen.”
But a year later, the two finally 
have the opportunity to help Flor -
ida. 
In a 77-72 victory against LSU 
on Sunday, UF lost senior forward Jennifer George, who suffered a dislocated right shoulder late in 
the second half.  
Lewis and Needles, along with 
Jaterra Bonds, responded by carry-
ing the team to a significant win. 
“Carlie, Jaterra and Kayla ... 
were our core tonight,” Butler said after the victory. “They did a great job of sustaining this through a lot of different ups and downs, and 
that’s important.” Finally healthy, Lewis antici-
pates improvement individually and as a team. 
“A lot of people have been 
excited to see me play and be 
healthy,” Lewis said.
“This is just the tip of the ice-
berg. I’m expecting a lot of myself, and I know my coaches and team-mates are (as well).”

Yeguete likely to replace Murphy in starting lineup tonight
Although more than half of Caldwell-
Pope’s field goal attempts have come from 
behind the arc this season, he has made 
51.8 percent of his two-point field goal at-
tempts.
Boynton said he and junior point guard 
Scottie Wilbekin will alternate defending 
Caldwell-Pope.
“Me and Scottie will try to pressure him a little bit and play help defense,” Boynton 
said. “That’s the main thing we have to do: make him take the tough twos.”
Offensive balance has been a problem 
for the Bulldogs this season. Caldwell-Pope 
is the only Georgia player to average dou-
ble-digit points. 
The Bulldogs are riding a four-game 
winning streak, but five of their seven loss-
es have come against unranked teams.
“They were losing to teams. I don’t know how,” Boynton said. 
“Honestly, before this sea-son, I thought they’d be good. So, I respect Geor -
gia.”
UF will not be at full 
strength in its revenge ef-fort.
Senior power forward 
Erik Murphy (fractured rib) is doubtful for tonight’s contest, Donovan said Monday. Junior forward Will Yeguete is the most likely candidate to occupy Murphy’s spot in the starting lineup. 
Yeguete missed last season’s meeting 
against the Bulldogs in Athens, Ga., with 
a fractured left foot, but the loss still reso-
nates with him. 
“Georgia gave us a hard time last year at 
their place,” Yeguete said. “I wish I could 
have been there, but we have to use that as 
motivation and play well against them.”DEfEnSE , from page 13

SEC HOOPS PREVIEW
A lack of depth has plagued Texas A&M (10-3) in losses 
to Saint Louis and Southern. The Gators travel to College 
Station on Jan. 17 and will look to stop the Aggies’ top 
scoring option, senior Elston Turner, who averages 15.5 
points per game.
 Coach Kevin Stallings hoped junior forward Rod 
Odom would develop into a consistent scorer this sea-
son but Odom has been inconsistent, averaging 9.6 
points per game. So has Vanderbilt (6-6), which plays 
at Florida on March 6.
The Bulldogs (5-7) struggled to overcome the loss of 
junior guard Jalen Steele, who fractured his right wrist in November. Steele returned Dec. 30 and should be healthy when Mississippi State plays at Florida on Feb. 9.
 Under new coach Frank Martin, the Gamecocks are off 
to a 10-3 start. Stopping South Carolina’s leading scorer 
Brenton Williams, who averages 13.1 points per game, will 
be key when the Gators host the Gamecocks   on Jan. 30.
JUCO transfer Shavon Coleman leads the Tigers 
(9-2) with 14.1 points and 8.6 rebounds per game 
this season. Florida will travel to Baton Rouge to face 
LSU on Jan. 12.
The Gators will take on the Bulldogs (6-7) in their 
SEC opener tonight at 7. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, 
who led the charge in UGA’s 76-62 upset victory 
against UF last year, is shooting 42.3 percent.
Coach Frank Haith has taken an inﬂ  ux of freshmen and 
transfers and turned them into a winner. The only play-
er returning from last year’s rotation is point guard Phil Pressey, who leads the SEC with 7.2 assists per game. The Gators face the Tigers (12-2, 1-0 SEC) at home on Jan. 19 and on Feb. 19 on the road. John Calipari has continued tradition by again assembling 
one of the NCAA’s youngest and most talented teams. Fresh-men Nerlens Noel, Archie Goodwin, Alex Poythress and Willie Cauley-Stein are all projected as ﬁ  rst round NBA Draft picks. The Gators host the Wildcats (9-4) on Feb. 12 and travel to 
Lexington on March 9. 
Five-star freshman Devonta Pollard hasn’t had the im-
pact he was expected to, but coach Anthony Grant always 
has the Crimson Tide (8-6, 0-1) playing solid defense, and leading scorer Trevor Releford has become a threat due to his improved three-point shooting. Florida hosts Alabama on March 2.
Arkansas’ four losses this year came against formidable op-
ponents (No. 2 Michigan, No. 7 Syracuse, Wisconsin, Arizona State). Behind guard BJ Young, who averages 17.7 points and 4.3 assists per game, the Razorbacks (9-4) should be one of the better squads in the SEC. Florida squares off against Arkan-sas in Fayetteville on Feb. 5 and at home Feb. 23.
Jarnell Stokes is off to a fast start in his sophomore cam-
paign after sitting out the ﬁ  rst half of his freshman year. The forward averages 11.3 points and 7 .5 rebounds per game. However, three of the Volunteers’ four losses came against unranked opponents. Florida faces Tennessee (8-4) in Knoxville on Feb. 26.
Propelled by forward Murphy Holloway, who 
averages a double-double (15.8 points, 10.9 
rebounds), Ole Miss (11-2) is off to its best start in three years. The Gators host the Reb-
els on Feb. 2. 
 The Gators (10-2) had their ﬁ  rst 7-0 start since 2009-10, 
defeating their opponents by a margin of 25.3 points. Erik 
Murphy’s potential absence could hurt Florida in the early going of SEC play. Murphy averaged 12.1 points and 4.7 rebounds per game prior to suffering a fractured rib. 
 Auburn (6-7) snagged a decent 78-72 win against 
Florida State on Jan. 2, but the undersized Tigers haven’t 
improved much since last year’s 15-win season. Florida faces Auburn on the road Feb. 16.
