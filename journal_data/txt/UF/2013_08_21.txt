Nicolas Rojas spent his 
last day in Gainesville grad-
uating, moving out of his apartment and trying to un-tangle a mess.
The 30-year-old, who left 
UF with a Masters of Busi-ness Administration on May 4, thought his apartment complex was going to offer a ﬂ  exible move-out policy and prorate rent, letting ten-ants pay for partial months. It would release him early so he could move to Tampa af-ter graduation.
Instead, he said the com-
plex disregarded oral agree-ments and tried to stick him with penalties for moving out early — contrary to promises made by management.
“That was my last day liv-
ing in Gainesville,” he said. “That was it.”
Rojas wasn’t the only 
one.
The Continuum, a gradu-
ate and professional student-housing complex, located at 425 W. University Ave., made and broke similar promises to dozens of tenants, accord-ing to a complaint recently ﬁ  led to the Attorney Gen-eral’s Consumer Protection Division by Brad Willard, a 31-year-old local attorney and former Continuum resi-dent.
Rojas said seven other 
people he knows personally were affected. According to

The Gator Nation is now pocket-sized.
UF has a new mobile app compatible 
with iPhones and Androids available for free.
The ofﬁ  cial native app, University of 
Florida, features UF news feeds, an event calendar, a directory, a campus map and an RTS tracker.
With access to ISIS, e-Learning and Ga-
torZone athletics updates, the mobile app has something for everyone, UF spokesman Steve Orlando said.
“If you look around, just about every 
student has a smartphone,” he said. “This is the best way to reach them and give them what they need.”
As of Monday, 7,921 people had down-
loaded the app through the App Store, and 2,688 downloaded it through Google Play, Orlando said.
Orlando said development for the native mobile app started in March by the UF In-formation Technology staff.
UFIT spent about 450 hours in total work-
ing on the app, Orlando said. About 300 of those hours were spent on development.
Sarah Aitchison, a 21-year-old UF nurs-
ing senior, said she would consider down-loading the app for the RTS tracker.
“I don’t really need a map these days be-
cause all my classes are in the same spot,” she said. “But I’m sure it would be helpful for freshmen.”Ofﬁ  cial, multipurpose university app available for free
� SAMUEL HAMILTON, 37, WAS 
KILLED IN GAINESVILLE JULY 14.
KATHRYN VARN
Alligator Staff Writer kvarn@alligator.org
More than a month after a local man was 
shot and killed at a southwest Gainesville 
apartment complex, police are still looking for the alleged killer.
“It’s like he just vanished,” said Gainesville Police Department spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben To-bias. “And we would deﬁ  nitely like to see him arrested.”
On the morning of July 14, Larry White-
head Jr. shot 37-year-old Samuel Hamilton in unit 4110 of Southern Pines apartment com-plex, according to witnesses who spoke with Gainesville Police detectives.
The 26-year-old then ran from the complex, 
located at 4125 SW 17th Place near the Wood-lands apartments. Ofﬁ  cers couldn’t ﬁ  nd him even after a search of the area, according to police.
A friend of Whitehead’s 
told detectives that he could have ﬂ  ed to Miami, said GPD spokesman Ofﬁ  cer Ben Tobias. However, the 
report is unconﬁ  rmed.
Lakeria Montgomery, a 
22-year-old friend of both 
men, said she believes the murder was an act of jealousy.  She was in an open relationship with Whitehead, who agreed to the arrange-ment, but when Montgomery started seeing Hamilton — whom she had dated before — Whitehead became almost obsessive, she said.
The morning of the murder, Montgomery 
was hanging out with Hamilton at the apart-ment. Whitehead started banging on the door while they were sleeping, she said, and a third friend let him in. 
Whitehead walked back to the bedroom 
where Montgomery was nestled on Hamil-

To manage traffic issues in Gainesville, some 
residents and city officials are desiring a new 
solution: a streetcar.
The Gainesville City Commission and the 
Regional Transit System are overseeing a study on a streetcar system that could potentially help traffic flow.
The study, which will be conducted by Tindale-
Oliver & Associates Inc., will cost the city about $100,000 and will come from the city’s general funds, said RTS Marketing and Communications Supervisor Chip Skinner.  
The study will run until December and will 
detail “what kind of vehicles, preferred routes, possible fares, and how many miles of track or roadway we will be resurfacing,” he said.
The final cost for inserting and operating the 
streetcar will be determined after the completed study, Skinner said, and funding could include government assistance.
“Federal government would probably look at 
a match, meaning there would be local tax money going into the project,” he said.
Although the study is in its earliest stages, 
Skinner said, the ultimate goal is to limit the amount of traffic between campus and the downtown area.
“Come December, we’ll have a better idea of 
exactly what we’re looking at,” he said.
Some residents have voiced opinions that the 
cost of the study outweighs possible benefits.
Gainesville resident Matthew Webster said he fears the cost of the study and streetcar system could snowball out of control.
“My concern is that eventually the operational 
costs and infrastructure costs will be passed on to the taxpayers” he said. “That’s a bigger crowd than you’d think. Students get taxed, and builders and developers would get taxed, too.”
While Webster said he recognizes some 
benefits the streetcar could deliver, he said the financial consequences are risky.
“I think the good for it could be some economic 
development,” he said. “Developers will bank that there will be a transit route in front of them. But at what cost?”
Webster said UF students should also consider 
the possible effect the streetcar system could have.
“What’s going to happen to the RTS fees that 
are part of the tuition?” he said. “How much more will you have to pay down the road?”
Area resident William Summerhill voiced 
similar concerns in an email to the city commission.
“It seems to me that a streetcar is an expensive 
‘cutesy’ idea with little practicality,” he wrote. “It would be a lot cheaper and more practical to simply increase the bus service.”A streetcar named possibility:

Gainesville resident the complaint Willard ﬁ  led, “dozens” of ten-
ants were affected.
Continuum employees do not deny that 
the agreements were made with leasers, ac-cording to the complaint. However, staff de-ferred the Alligator’s interview request to a spokesman for the management company, Alton Irwin of Alabama-based Capstone Companies.
Irwin initially said he wasn’t aware of the 
complaint but that he would comment if pro-vided with a copy. Once the Alligator pro-vided a copy to him, he refused to comment.
According to the complaint, Continuum 
representatives told some tenants who were in the nine-month Masters of Business Ad-ministration program that although the con-tract stated leasing was only available in one-year blocks, they would be able to move out at the end of nine months and could pay for a partial month after graduation.
As the May 4 graduation date for the 
MBA program neared, Continuum staff be-gan telling residents of a different policy, saying they must give management 45 days notice of move-out if they intended to termi-nate their leases early. Staff also began tell-ing tenants they would have to pay for the whole month of May if they remained past April 30.
Rojas said The Continuum also added a 
$1,000 fee and said proration was no longer available. Outgoing residents were told they must move out April 30 or pay for the entire month of May.
Even though Rojas said The Continuum 
tried to change agreements, the complex eventually waived the $1,000 fee for all resi-dents and let him move out early.
On May 4, Rojas packed up and moved 
to Tampa.

The complex — completed in 2011 — dis-
plays a logo on its website linking it with UF Housing and Residence Education. The logo labels the complex as a “provident commu-nity for University of Florida graduate stu-dents.”
UF Housing and Residence Education 
representatives would not comment on the complaint but instead issued a statement saying, “Issues regarding The Continuum business operations are handled by The Con-tinuum staff. The Continuum is a Capstone Inc. property.”
That linkage is “misleading in the sense 
that they’re saying they’re advocates for stu-dents,” Rojas said.
At the beginning of August, Rojas said, he 
received an invoice in the mail stating that he owes The Continuum the rest of the rent money for May plus the full amounts for June and July because he “defaulted” on the lease.
“I just want them to know they can’t get 
away with this,” Willard said.

The men involved both had criminal backgrounds, records show
ton’s shoulder. There was no ﬁ  ght, no struggle, just a shot to 
the head — a swift execution. Montgomery said she was be-side him in the bed the whole time and feared that Whitehead would shoot her, too.
“I told him, ‘I’m not the girl for you,’ and gave him the 
choice to leave,” she said. “You think you can make somebody love you, but you just can’t do that.”However, Montgomery said she did love Hamilton, whom 
she remembers as a kind man, soft-spoken and subdued. They met through Montgomery’s mother about a year ago and be-came romantically involved. She met Whitehead later on, and the three of them used to hang out together as friends.
According to court records, both men had criminal back-
grounds, which included armed robbery and assault charges.
But ﬁ  ve weeks after the shooting, as Montgomery sat on the 
couch in her small apartment the next complex over from the murder scene, she said she never thought something like this would happen.
“I just want them to catch Whitehead,” she said through 
tears. “I just want answers.”MURDER , from page 1 “I just want them to catch Whitehead. I just

Graduate assistants can look for-
ward to getting a little more green 
for their work.
UF and Graduate Assistants 
United, the bargaining unit for more than 4,000 graduate assistants,  agreed to a contract that includes pay raises.
About 500 graduate assistants 
will receive a 10 percent increase in their minimum stipends starting on Oct. 1, according to a university news release.
“This year’s improved budget 
allows us to provide additional support to graduate teaching assis-tants,” UF President Bernie Machen said in the release. “Their contribu-tion to our education programs is important and very much appreci-ated.”
The 500 students were earning 
less than the new minimum sti-pend. 
The new contract includes an 
across-the-board increase of 4.4 per-cent to new and existing graduate assistants’ base salaries.
“This is great news,” said UF 
spokeswoman Janine Sikes. “Presi-dent Machen has long supported helping lift our grad students, which are an important piece of the broad-er university community.”The next step for the agreement 
is ratiﬁ  cation, Paula Varnes Fussell, vice president for human resource services, wrote in an email. GAU’s membership and UF’s Board of Trustees still must OK the agree-ment, according to the release.
“The increases are very good 
news and shows the commitment by the president in support of our GAs,”  Fussell said.
Other compensation announce-
ments regarding UF employees were announced earlier this summer and included eligible staff receiving a 3.5 percent salary increase and eligible faculty seeing an increase in their annual base pay, Fussell said.
Eligible faculty who earn less 
than $40,000 will receive a $1,400 increase in base pay, and those earning more than $40,000 will get $1,000, with the ﬁ  gures adjusted for part-time and full-time status, ac-cording to the release.
Funds for faculty merit raises will 
be available on Oct. 1 for faculty that did not qualify for the bargaining unit, according to the statement.Graduate assistants to get

Columnists for 
Fall 2013
Welcome back to Gainesville, Gators! Did you miss the 
soupy weather? The dependable afternoon monsoons? The herds of lanyard-wearing, starry-eyed freshmen 
around every corner? Of course you did! 
One thing you didn’t miss is the deadline to apply to one of 
the open columnist positions for the Alligator’s Opinions Pages this semester. 
The Alligator publishes ﬁ  ve times a week — Monday through 
Friday — during the Fall and Spring semesters. This means we need students of every age, major, year and political ideology to write weekly 500- to 600-word columns. 
Applicants should be able to produce articulate, thought-pro-
voking analyses and commentary on current events. Anything is fair game: domestic and foreign politics, pop culture, ﬁ  nance, sex and relationships, issues facing minority communities and campus politics. 
We’re looking for strong writers familiar with basic elements 
of style and who have a passion for deadlines. A sharp sense of humor helps. 
We will be ﬁ  lling ﬁ  ve to six positions for the Fall semester, 
depending on how many applications we receive. 
If you’re interested in becoming a weekly columnist, you 
should submit a resume, a brief cover letter explaining why you’d be a good ﬁ  t for our Opinions Pages and a short explana-tion of your political persuasion — conservative, liberal, liber-tarian, socialist, etc. Please keep in mind that “Republican” and “Democrat” are parties, not ideologies. 
If you have been previously published or keep a blog, please 
send three examples of your work. If you have not been pub-lished before, you may send two 500- to 600-word writing sam-ples demonstrating what your work for the Alligator would be like. 
Above all, a columnist’s job is to take a stand using facts and 
reputable sources to defend his or her opinions. Columnists should frame their opinions in an articulate, succinct manner and should strive to present original topics and material. At the Alligator, we value integrity, professionalism and honesty at all times. 
If you apply and are not selected as a weekly columnist, we 
still strongly encourage you to submit guest columns and let-ters to the editor. We accept these submissions throughout the semester and value input from our readers on campus happen-ings, local, state and national politics and anything else that ap-pears on the Opinions Pages.
The more familiar we are with your work, the better your 
chances of being selected for a columnist position in the future. 
Guest columns should be between 450 and 600 words. They 
should include the author’s name, year, major and the school he or she attends. All statistics, external references, facts and ﬁ  gures should be sourced and cited. 
Letters to the editor should be between 150 and 200 words 
and should include the author’s name and any other relevant information — major, organizations he or she belongs to, etc. 
Columnist applications should be sent as attachments to

Earlier this summer, I worked as an intern at the 
AFL-CIO national headquarters in Washington, DC. 
The AFL-CIO is a national confederation of labor 
unions that advocates on behalf of American workers, 
including the working poor. 
As part of my internship, I had the opportunity to 
meet with Rep. Ted Yoho (R-FL), the congressman who represents Gainesville, to discuss legislation proposed in Congress that would raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 per hour from its current level of $7.25. 
Although the congressman and I had sharply 
divergent opinions about the merits of increasing the 
minimum wage, our conversation was respectful and cordial. 
Rep. Yoho informed me that he empathized with the 
struggles of minimum wage workers in America because he and his wife relied on food stamps to supplement their meager income early in their marriage. 
He said that, although he opposed giving government 
assistance to the working class, he had a strong desire to increase economic growth to help ensure prosperity for all Americans.
Unfortunately, recent statements made by Rep. Yoho 
suggest that his actual views on the plight of the poor and working class in America are much less charitable than he initially led me to believe. 
According to Right Wing Watch, a website that 
reports on statements made by conservative Republicans relating to key issues, Yoho casually dismissed the problem of hunger in America as nonexistent at a recent town hall meeting.
“I think there’s 330 million people starving, at least 
three times a day,” Yoho said. “We call it breakfast, lunch and dinner.”
Yoho asserted that millions of Americans who 
beneﬁ  t from programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, often called “food stamps”) are not truly in need of government assistance. 
He said cutting the SNAP 
program would not cause harm to anyone and that “not one person would lose a calorie or a crumb that deserves it.”
Yoho’s callous joke and his portrayal of many SNAP 
users as greedy freeloaders ignore the signiﬁ  cant and growing problem of food insecurity in America. 
Feeding America, a hunger advocacy group, reported 
that 50 million Americans — that’s 15 percent of all households — experienced food insecurity at some point during 2009. 
This means that millions of Americans, many of 
whom are employed in minimum-wage or low-wage jobs, are frequently unable to afford enough food for themselves and their families. 
Rep. Yoho’s opposition to measures like fully funding 
SNAP and increasing the minimum wage — both of which would help combat the problems of poverty and food insecurity in America —  is damaging to the interests of his constituents and those of the nation as a whole. 
His support for eviscerating the American social 
safety net despite relying on it himself in the past is deeply hypocritical. 
The people of Gainesville and Alachua County, 
particularly the working poor, deserve advocates in Congress to help ensure that their most basic needs are being met.

Welcome to the Fall 2013 semester! 
I am so thrilled for the year ahead and even more excited 
to have the opportunity to represent more than 50,000 Gators 
here at the University of Florida. 
It is an amazing time to be a student at the 
University of Florida. As the state’s flagship uni-
versity, we are always finding ways to improve our campus and the overall student experience. A great example of this can be seen right at the 
heart of our campus in our student union. Currently undergoing a $75 million renovation and expansion, the J. Wayne Reitz Union will soon have enough space to house all of our 900+ student organizations and serve as our central hub for student services. 
Looking back at my time here, the best advice I can give to any 
Gator is that your time here is what you make of it. Join the club you got a flier for, attend the seminar that interests you and take an active role in the UF community. There is no better way to enhance your UF experience than to immerse yourself right in it. 
With such a diverse campus and large Student Body, finding your 
niche becomes even more important. Although it might take some time, there is a place for everyone on this campus, all you need to do is seek it out! For me, Student Government was my niche and I en-courage anyone who is interested to come visit our offices on the third floor of the Reitz Union and see what we have to offer our students. From agencies to services, there are many ways to get involved.
During my campaign for Student Body President, I really enjoyed 
blogging to everyone what I was doing. After taking office, I created a new blog (www.studentbodyprezuf.blogspot.com), which I have kept updated in order to properly inform the Student Body on the projects that my administration and I are working on. Additionally, I also in-clude some tips on life in Gainesville, upcoming events and ways to enhance your experience on campus. 
I can’t wait to spend this year representing the Student Body. If you 
ever have anything you would like to see on campus, always feel free to stop by my office. 
Good luck this semester, and go Gators! Christina Bonarrigo is UF’s Student Body President.SBP welcomes you backGuest column

Dove World Outreach Center, the local 
ministry that sparked controversy by threatening 
to burn Qurans in 2010, ﬁ  nalized the sale of its property to Spirit of Faith ministries July 15.
The Rev. Melanie Guistwite, one of Spirit 
of Faith’s pastors, said the church will begin renovating the two buildings on the 20-acre 
property located at 5805 NW 37th St.
“We’re just going to do a complete overhaul of the existing 
buildings,” she said. 
Spirit of Faith’s grand opening celebration is scheduled for the 
weekend of Sept. 14 and 15.
Terry Jones, the leader of Dove ministries, said the property 
sold for about $1.2 million.
Jones said the sale went smoothly but took longer than he 
hoped.
“There actually wasn’t anything that came up at the last 
minute,” he said. “Everything went very well. For a project of this size, it just takes a lot of time.”
For now, Jones said he is searching for a place to replant his 
ministry in the Tampa/St. Petersburg area. 
“We deﬁ  nitely have been looking, and in fact, have contacted 
for a facility in that area,” he said.
Spirit of Faith, which formerly met at the Phillips Center for the 
Performing Arts, will continue holding services at 1414 NE 23rd Ave. until September.8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 21, 2013

Pedro Bravo’s murder trial likely 
won’t happen until next year.
Bravo, who is accused of kidnap-
ping and killing UF student Chris-
tian Aguilar, appeared at a pretrial conference July 26 at the Alachua County Courthouse as lawyers ar-gued about a schedule for evidence discovery and the depositions of 103 witnesses.
Judge Denise Ferrero, who took 
over the case from Peter Sieg, set a deposition cutoff of Jan. 14.
State Attorney Brian Kramer said 
witnesses live across the state — in Tampa, Orlando and Miami — so travel must be considered. 
“We have a genuine desire to 
have this case brought to trial in a reasonable time period,” Kramer said.
Bravo’s defense lawyer, Michael 
Ruppert, said he’s set some deposi-tion dates for mid-September.
“I understand the family wants 
this to come to closure,” Ruppert said.
Kramer also mentioned he was 
waiting to receive test results on two pieces of evidence: the duct tape used to bind Aguilar and a comput-er seized from Bravo’s apartment.Pedro Bravo lawyers argue schedule

UF students will soon 
have 3-D printing capabili-
ties, use of more iPads and access to Wi-Fi in the Natu-ral Area Teaching Lab in the southwest corner of campus, thanks to the 2013 technology fee awards.
The technology fee awards 
focus on enhancing instruc-tional technology resources, said UF Information Tech-nology spokeswoman Tracy Gale. The money for the proj-ects comes from a state-man-dated technology fee, which was first implemented at UF in 2009.
This year, about $700,000 in 
funding was allocated for 11 upcoming campus projects.
“Technology changes so 
fast,” she said. “The tech fee allows us to deliver cutting-edge software and services to meet the changing needs of not only the technology but our students and faculty.”
Gale said the time it takes 
to implement the projects will vary. Proposals that call for classroom renovation would have taken place in the sum-mer, she said.
Sara Gonzalez, a science 
and technology librarian, ap-plied and received funding for the 3-D printer that will be in the Marston Science Li-brary. Because several fields are now requiring employees to be able to use these print-ers, she said, the 3-D printer is something students should become experienced with be-fore graduation.
Peggy Carr, associate dean 
and professor for the College of Design, Construction and Planning, received funding for the creation of a joint digi-tal fabrication laboratory.
“We think that this is an 
area of student interest that is going to grow,” she said. “We really feel like it’s essential to have these facilities for our students.”WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 21, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 9

� SOME RESIDENTS AREN’T HAPPY WITH THE IDEA. 
HANNA MARCUS
Alligator Staff Writer hmarcus@alligator.org
Although the square plot of land 
near the intersection of 13th Street 
and West University Avenue is va-cant, it’s been stirring up dialogue for months. 
Miami-based development com-
pany the Swerdlow Group has been working with the City of Gainesville to legally amend the city’s compre-hensive plan to allow construction of a new multi-story residential de-velopment called University Cor-ners. 
Via two proposals, the compa-
ny asked Gainesville to adopt two separate ordinances to rezone the property to allow a taller building — something the current zoning wouldn’t allow. 
“Under current law, they could 
do the same project, but not quite as big,” said City Commissioner Thomas Hawkins. “Gainesville is going to grow. We’re trying to make it grow, but we only have a certain amount of space. We need to allow people to build taller buildings to accommodate for that.” A multi-story building would of-
fer more jobs and more opportuni-ties, Hawkins said. 
Because of the location and the 
number of people that could reside at the University Corners building, Hawkins said, costs such as trans-portation could be significantly re-duced for residents. 
However, not all Gainesville 
residents are ready to support the project. 
Lisa Limpert, a 58-year-old 
Gainesville resident, said she does not support the proposed ordi-nance. 
Limpert, who has lived in 
Gainesville for 47 years, said the building, which could range from eight to 13 stories, will not only ruin the aesthetics of the area, but also would complicate traffic and pedes-trian situations.
“The intersection of 13th Street 
and University Avenue has traffic issues as it now stands,” she wrote in an email. “Adding a huge retail and residential complex on that cor-ner without considering the impact on traffic is irresponsible.” 
Tom Rider, retired owner of  
Goerings Book Store, agreed the project would be a bad move for Gainesville. 
“I’m proud that I live in a neigh-
borhood that’s really come back af-ter years of neglect,” he said. “But I see this project as a step in the wrong direction.” 
It’s the wrong direction because 
of the parking garage included in the plans for the complex, Rider said. 
Adding the garage without a 
“careful look at the impact of park-ing structure on the traffic that it generates” could interfere with traf-fic patterns, he said.
The garage could also block 
sunlight from nearby buildings, he said. 
Because some financing for the 
project would come through the city’s Community Redevelopment Agency, Rider said, the project could be risky for taxpayers. 
“It’s one thing for developers to 
decide that maybe something will work, but they’re not taking the risk,” Rider said. “They’re making sure it’s the city, and ultimately city taxpayers, that are taking the risk.” 
The City Commission must pass 
both proposed ordinances so the building can be constructed accord-ing to the developer’s plan.

Gov. Rick Scott appointed two new mem-
bers to UF’s Board of Trustees.
James “Bill” Heavener and Jason Rosenberg 
join David Thomas, who was selected earlier 
this year, as the three newest gubernatorial appointees on UF’s board. They will replace Steven Scott, whose term ended; Alan Levine, who moved to the statewide Board of Gov-ernors earlier this year; and Michael Heekin, whose appointment was not conﬁ  rmed by the Florida Senate.
The new members’ terms 
already began and are due to end Jan. 6, 2016, according to a news release from Scott’s press ofﬁ  ce. The appointments were routine, said UF spokeswom-an Janine Sikes, and they’re both Gators.Heavener is from Winter Park, where’s he’s 
the CEO and co-chairman of Full Sail Univer-sity. He earned a bachelor’s degree in busi-ness administration from UF in 1970. He’s the namesake of the Heavener Football Complex behind the Bull Gator on campus.
Rosenberg, of Gainesville, is a plastic sur-
geon who specializes in breast cancer recon-struction. He got a psychology degree from UF in 1990, his master’s degree in anatomy in 1993 and his doctor of medicine degree in 1995.
Both made political contributions in the last 
presidential election cycle.
According to campaign ﬁ  nance records, 
Heavener donated a total of $135,000 to the su-per PAC Restore Our Future, a political action 
committee supporting Mitt Romney. He also contribut-ed more $62,000 to various Republican groups.

The Hippodrome Theatre has 
launched an online campaign via www.
kickstarter.com to raise $15,000 for a new digital projection system in response to the movie industry’s transition to a digi-tal format.
Studios nationwide will discontinue 
the use of 35-millimeter ﬁ  lm reels start-ing in 2014. Cinemas that cannot accom-modate the change will no longer receive a wide selection of movies.
“Hollywood’s basically said, ‘You go 
digital, or you go dark,’” said Hippo-drome Cinema Director Alisha Kinman. 
While larger theaters have the funds 
to change immediately, Kinman said the challenge for local, independent theaters like the Hippodrome are small staffs and low budgets.
Ryan Wolf, a 27-year-old analytical 
chemistry graduate student, frequently sees shows at the Hippodrome and said he plans to donate online. 
The Hippodrome will use $25,000 in 
grants for the transition, but intends to fund the rest using the Kickstarter web-site. Within about 24 hours of announcing the project, it had received about $1,000 in pledges. The drive ends Sept. 20.The Hipp kickstarts its

STARKE — Church steeples 
along roads and a Ten Command-
ments monument at the courthouse were among the most apparent re-ligious symbols of Starke — until June 29, that is.
That’s when another symbol 
joined the predominantly Bap-tist town 30 miles northeast of Gainesville: the first atheist-spon-sored monument erected on govern-ment property in the U.S., according to the American Atheists group.
Under cloudy skies, about 300 
people pressed in front of the Brad-ford County Courthouse to witness the unveiling of the monument: a 4-foot-tall granite pillar with a bench attached bearing inscriptions of quotes from famous atheists.
Although Bradford County 
Commissioner Danny Riddick, who opened the ceremony, didn’t specifi-cally express approval of the monu-ment, he emphasized the opportu-nity to ask questions.
“By having both monuments side 
by side, I hope [visitors can] search [the] context of both and find their true meanings,” he said. “This is the most important decision a person can make: ‘What to do with God?’”
When Riddick read a Bible verse 
that included “serve the Lord,” someone in the crowd yelled, “serve nobody!”
The clash of ideas first came to 
light in Starke when New Jersey-based nonprofit American Atheists, along with a local resident, sued the county in 2005 for a lighted cross that used to perch on top of a water tower. It was removed in 2007. 
Then, in 2012, a local Christian 
men’s group paid about $20,000 to install the Ten Commandments monument at the courthouse, ac-cording to American Atheists.
It caught the attention of the group and sparked a lawsuit, which led to a series of negotiations with Bradford County government, which ended in the agreement to erect a second monument present-ing an alternative viewpoint.
For many, the monument is an is-
sue of regional identity.
With a Southern cross flag in 
hand, 20-year-old Marshall Raw-son said the new monument is dis-respectful to the region’s heritage because it is “imposing Northern ideas” — such as a broader defini-tion of morality — on an area that may not be rooted in the same val-ues. He explained how the flag he held was the type flown over the capitol post-Civil War during An-drew Jackson’s presidency.
“Our push is to preserve our 
Southern heritage,” he said. “Every nation should have a cultural iden-tity.”
However, Bridget Gaudette, 
a local activist and a director for Foundation Beyond Belief who also spoke during the ceremony, said the monument does represent the ideals of a segment of the local population.
She said the willingness of Amer-
ican Atheists to draw attention to the Starke courthouse helped other local atheists who had been quiet about their beliefs to organize.
“With the weight of a national or-
ganization behind them, they were more willing to step forward,” she said.
Daniel Cooney, who filed the 
lawsuit against the courthouse, was one. He stepped up to the lectern wearing a camouflage ball cap and cargo shirt with the sleeves rolled up. When Cooney wanted to combat the Ten Commandments monument, he lacked the resources to speak up on his own, so he said he had to “find...a friend with a big stick.” He found that friend in American Atheists.
The speeches during the dedica-
tion ceremony were punctuated by blasts from semi truck horns.
That’s because Patti Hinds, the 
owner of two businesses that share office space opposite the courthouse, stood across the street with a group of about 10 people holding signs made of file folders that said “Honk for Jesus,” written in marker.
Gospel music blared from the 
stereo of a green Chevy Silverado parked on the curb.
Although Hinds said she thought it important to protest, she said the new monument probably won’t have a lasting impact.
“I think it’s just people kicking 
and screaming,” she said.
President of American Atheists 
Dave Silverman closed the ceremo-ny, saying the historic code is the definition of hate speech because it invokes violence on those who don’t follow it. He then condemned the penalties associated with breaking the Ten Commandments. The athe-ist monument, he said, represents ideals without underlying threats.
And then someone pulled the 
red cloth from the monument.
As people crowded around the 
monument to take photos, Cana-dian evangelist Sye Ten Bruggen-cate climbed on top of the bench. He set down a plastic toilet seat and a roll of toilet paper and declared the monument was complete.
Spurred on by an angry crowd, 
a bystander hurled the toilet paper away and tried to snatch the seat. Ten Bruggencate climbed down and tucked the toilet seat under his arm.
“I think we have to engage people 
rationally,” he said. “It was a joke, but it exposed their intolerance.”
Bradford County Sheriff Gordon 
Smith, who attended the ceremony out of uniform, said he didn’t rec-ognize any of the outspoken evan-gelicals at the event. Most, he said, had already come to terms with the monument and allowed it to be un-veiled peacefully.
After Ten Bruggencate stood on 
the monument, the bench began sliding out of place. A deputy roped off a small area surrounding it with yellow crime-scene tape and orange traffic cones. Smith said the accident happened because the grout hold-ing the monument together hadn’t fully hardened.
“This thing started sliding, and 
I said ‘Oh, Lord,’” he said with a chuckle.
Although American Atheists 
asserted it will erect similar monu-
ments across the country, the Rev. Les Singleton, of Micanopy, said he thinks the situation in Starke was handled with a good compromise.
“It’s probably a satisfactory reso-
lution to put something alongside instead of removing,” he said. 
But he said the Starke monument 
will have limited impact.
“I’d be surprised if it’s more than 
a blip in the news,” he said. “I think it’s a hiccup.”

UF students won’t be voting in Student Govern-
ment elections from their smartphones or off-campus 
apartments anytime soon.
The Student Senate rejected a bill that would 
have allowed secure site online voting. Senators Nic Knowlton, Helie Dharia and Warren Rhea led the discussion in favor of the bill, referencing projected increases in voter turnout. Senators Dylan Fisher, Austin Sherman and Joseph Michaels headed the ar-gument against it, citing concerns about the integrity of votes.
The Senate passed the amended ﬁ  scal year 2013-
2014 activity and service fee budget, which totals $18,992,300. Among the changes is a reduction of about $23,000 for the readership program, which had provided copies of The New York Times and USA Today on campus. Michaels, also the budget and appropriations chairman, said the new amount of $27,173 will allow for digital subscriptions.
“If a student were to go to one of the newspaper 
stands early in the morning, more than likely there would not be a newspaper for them to grab,” he said. “People who were there earlier get to them ﬁ  rst — so, professors, community members. There is no way to dictate who gets these newspapers.”
Michaels said because students pay the activity 
and service fees, they should be the ones beneﬁ  ting from the program.STUDENT GOVERNMENTSenate passes

The “Whispering Close” sculpture 
— the last remaining part of the $35,000 “Crossing Paths” exhibition by Seward Johnson that came to campus in June 2011 — was broken down into pieces and lifted by crane onto a truck that hauled them away.
Jenee Castellanos, associate curator of 
the Sculpture Foundation that loaned UF the statue, said the loan had expired.“It’s been part of my experience here, 
and I hate to see it go,” said Mitchell Smith, a 20-year-old UF food and re-source economics sophomore.
But not everyone felt the same way.Taylor Lilly, a 19-year-old UF natural

“I hope they put something prettier 
there instead,” Lilly said. “It was kind of ominous and creepy.”

� THE COMPANY AND UF ARE STILL NEGOTIATING.
SAMANTHA SCHUYLER

Due to an outstanding debt of 
almost $30,000, delivery of both The 
New York Times and USA Today to the UF campus was suspended this summer.
The readership program, which 
provides free digital and physical copies of both papers to students, is a partnership between the two companies. USA Today handles the contracting and billing to the school as well as distribution of the paper. 
According to a USA Today 
representative who preferred to remain anonymous, Student Government and USA Today signed a service agreement that called for $66,590 for the 2012-13 school year. 
SG submitted a purchase order 
for $40,000. 
“We get a call from USA Today 
within the last month saying, ‘You’ve got to cancel all the papers at UF because they’re not going to pay their bill,’” said Kevin Cappallo, national director of education sales for The New York Times. “There’s an outstanding balance of, I’m thinking, 20-something-thousand.”
But UF Student Body President 
Christina Bonarrigo said she was not aware of a vote to reduce the allocation.
“I am aware that a purchase 
agreement was made for a certain amount of money and that UF honored that agreement,” she said.
She said the contract, signed in 
2010, featured a clause that said funds were “subject to availability.”“We went through the proper 
avenues of the program that was requested,” Bonarrigo said. “It was passed through the senate body and the Budget and Appropriations Committee.”
The USA Today representative 
said a conference call was scheduled in an attempt to work with SG, but the students were a “no-show.”
Similarly, Cappallo said he’s had 
trouble reaching SG.
“I have made several overtures 
to contact the president of SGA,” he said. “I’ve tried contacting the adviser of SGA and haven’t gotten any response.”
However, Bonarrigo said she talked to the USA Today representative twice in early May. 
“We discussed options about 
the program,” she said. “[The representative] hoped we would continue the program for the upcoming years, and it’s something the Senate would discuss in the upcoming year’s budget.”
According to the representative, 
USA Today had been trying to get in contact with SG since the beginning of the year. It was only until recently that they communicated with Bonarrigo — after she had been contacted by the Alligator for information. 
“[SG] didn’t say, ‘You’re 
spending too much of our money.’ The red ﬂ  ag never went up…then we would have dug further,” the representative said. “But instead, nobody got that message to the USA Today Orlando local ofﬁ  ce.”
As a result of the reduced 
purchasing order, both papers will be forced to write off the debt, but for now will not be sending the university’s account to collections, which could show negligent activity and lower the university’s credit score, according to the representative. 
“It’d be a shame for [the 
program] to end,” said Patrick Reakes, Chairman of Library West. “I know it’s been heavily used by the students.”
While USA Today believes the 
university should be liable for the papers used, it still wants to continue the program.

Despite Florida Gov. Rick Scott’s efforts 
to the contrary, tuition will increase this 
Fall.
UF Board of Trustees passed a regula-
tion amendment that will raise undergrad-uate resident students’ tuition by about $4.01 per credit hour, which totals about $120 each year. Of that, most UF students will pay about $30 — Bright Futures, which recently went up, covers most of the extra charge.
The board was obligated to comply with 
state statutes mandating a 1.7 percent an-nual adjustment for inflation. The trustees were reticent to pass the higher tuition rate — trustee Christopher Corr even asked what would happen if they broke the law.
“I’m really required to follow the law. 
The law may not be what everybody wants the law to be,”  chairman David Brown said. “But it is, in fact, the law.”
Trustee Carolyn Roberts said the deci-
sion put the board in “a very uncomfort-able position” because she agreed with the governor’s consideration of Florida fami-lies.
To lessen the blow of the tuition hike, 
the board agreed to put half of the result-ing revenue toward need-based financial aid and half toward campus maintenance.
“The administration tried every means 
possible to minimize the financial impact of attending the University of Florida,” said President Bernie Machen.
Machen was the center of a different fi-
nancial discussion when the board voted to raise his annual compensation to $725,492 — a possible $750,500 if employee raises come through. His former total compensa-tion had been $565,492.
His base salary was 
increased by $60,000 ret-roactive to Jan. 1, but that money is not from tax-payers. The Florida Leg-islature caps the public contributions to a public 
university president’s pay at $225,000. Machen’s new 
base salary will be $500,158, so non-public funds will pay for his raise. His term was also extended through the end of 2014.
That means Machen will be at UF for its 
state-designated creation of the eCampus, an institute for online learning. UF Provost Joe Glover said by January 2014, eCampus hopes to offer five bachelor’s degree pro-grams.
“We can only have 6,500 students every 
year,” he said. “We’ve got 29- or 30,000 ap-plications, so there’s clearly much more demand for access to University of Florida degrees. This is a way by which we can ac-tually increase access.”16, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 21, 2013

� HE SAID UF CAN INVEST IN NEW INITIATIVES.
JULIA GLUM
Alligator Staff Writer
For the ﬁ  rst time in six years, UF programs won’t be 
cut as a result of the state’s budget.
Florida Gov. Rick Scott signed the $74.1 billion Fami-
lies First budget, which restores $300 million cut from 
universities last year. Scott also vetoed $368 million in projects — including a 3 percent undergraduate tuition increase.
“We have money to invest in new initiatives,” UF 
President Bernie Machen said in a Q-and-A session with local media. “We really have a pretty much balanced budget, so we’re not looking for cuts, we’re looking for reinvestments.”
The budget appropriates roughly $616 million to UF. 
That breaks down into about $329 million for education and general projects, $107 million for the Health Science Center, $141 million for IFAS and about $39 million in construction and maintenance funds.
“I think the Legislature and the governor are in a 
situation where our state’s economy has rebounded,” he said. “They could have invested in a whole bunch of things, but the majority of the new funding that is com-ing into our state is going to education —  higher educa-tion and K-12 education.”
Machen speciﬁ  cally mentioned the preeminence 
proposal, which will provide $15 million a year to be matched by UF for increasing faculty resources.
“All of that, I think, if we do it strategically, will help 
us move forward in the national rankings,” Machen said.
He added students can expect faculty members who 
feel rewarded after years of no raises. Graduate teach-ing assistants will see increased compensation as well, the details of which Machen said will be negotiated with Graduate Assistants United.
About $15 million will go toward the construction of a new chemistry building. That amount is not enough to complete the project, Machen said, but “it’s a good step forward.”
Despite his words of warning that the state is still 
fragile and recovering, Machen was positive about the budget.
“This is Florida,” he said. “If any state has a great fu-
ture, it’s us.”

Business is on the rise for a local theater that reopened in June 
and shows $2 second-run movies.
The renovated four-screen theater, Gators 4, located at 6741 W. 
Newberry Road, was once an AMC franchise that later changed 
to Gators Cinema. It closed last year for remodeling, including the replacement of 200 seats, the installation of a digital projector in one of the theaters, painting of the ﬂ  oors and replacement of sew-age lines.
“Business is getting busier every week,” said Michael O’Brien, 
the general manager who has worked at Gators 4 for about 15 years while the theater changed hands four times.
He said the theater — which accepts cash only — can offer $2 
tickets because the movies that are shown have been out in theaters for about four to eight weeks.
Although the theater is cleaner and in better condition, O’Brien 
said reopening a business is always a challenge. He said the air conditioning unit turns off occasionally, and older equipment is starting to rust.
Candace Webb, an 18-year-old UF nursing freshman, said her 
recent experience at the remodeled theater was positive.
“It was clean and very affordable,” she said. “You can tell the 
theater is old but well-maintained.”Gators 4 Cinema

A white bike chained to a fence 
begs passers-by not to drink and 
drive.
The family of Rebecca Harris, a 
UF student killed July 11, 2012 in a hit and run, installed a ghost bike at the intersection of Southwest 16th Avenue and Archer Road for the anniversary of her death.
“We wanted to try and ﬁ  nd a 
way to balance the brightness and joy with also a thought that people would think about drinking and driving,” said her father, 48-year-old James Harris. “Maybe students who pass by the ghost bike will see it and think about its purpose.”
Ghost bikes are small somber 
memorials for bicyclists killed or hit on the street. A bicycle is painted entirely white and locked to a street sign near the crash site to serve as a reminder of the tragedy and as a quiet statement in support of cyclists’ rights to safe travel.
James Harris and his family 
decided to bring ghost bikes to Gainesville and felt it would be the ideal way to remember their “Becca.” 
They used a bike belonging to 
Rebecca Harris’ older sister, Anna Harris. James Harris spray-painted it white and decorated it with ﬂ  owers and trinkets. “I wanted it to look kind of 
ghostly at night,” James Harris said. “We used ﬂ  owers and butterﬂ  ies because Rebecca was a very happy young lady and full of life.” 
The Harris family put a poster by the bike that reads “Drive Sober.” A picture of Rebecca Harris along with a description of what happened the night of the accident is there as well.  
The bike hangs on university property so it’s exempt from Department of Transportation jurisdiction.
Tanja Philhower, assistant dean 
and case manager for the Dean of Students Ofﬁ  ce at UF, worked with the family to coordinate the ghost bike project. Philhower is responsible for providing support to students and families in crisis. 
“I was glad to hear from 
Rebecca’s family when they 
contacted me and was heartened 
to know that they were trying to create something positive out of Rebecca’s tragic death last year,” she said. “I thought that the ghost bike was a beautiful and powerful way to honor Rebecca’s memory.”   
Catherine Harris, 21, Rebecca 
Harris’ twin sister and a UF public relations senior, said she believed the ghost bike would raise awareness of the situation.
“Even if the bike will only affect 
one person, that’s a plus,” she said. “I hope that people will see it and think twice. Just stop for a minute and think.”WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 21, 2013 � ALLIGATOR, 19

Midtown gained another bar, but one of its 
late-night restaurants relocated.
Munchies 420 Cafe, a Midtown restaurant 
popular for late-night snacking, was  replaced 
by The Rowdy Reptile bar.
Munchies, located at 1702 W. University Ave. 
in the UF Plaza, will be reopening at a different Gainesville location, but owner J.D. Chester said he couldn’t yet disclose where.
Chester, who also owns the downstairs bar 
Fat Daddy’s, said the space was remodeled for The Rowdy Reptile, which offers drink specials and affordable bar food.
The space has been undergoing renovations 
since June, Chester said.
He said moving Munchies and replacing 
it with a bar was a better ﬁ  t for the area’s con-sumer base.
“The bar downstairs is so monumentally 
successful that we decided it made more sense,” Chester said.
The ﬁ  rst of the two Munchies locations, which 
originated in Sarasota, was featured in the real-ity show Man v. Food about three years ago.
Chester said he felt that moving the 
Gainesville Munchies to a smaller space could evoke a small-town feel similar to that of the original restaurant.
The move will also give Munchies a chance 
to create a better atmosphere, he said.
“It needs bumper stickers all over the wall,” 
Chester said. “This place is just too big for that.”
The new location could possibly be a Munch-
ies Express, Chester said, but all of the most popular items will be there.
Crispyn Coller, a 23-year-old UF alumnus 
who works at UF Plaza, said he was a little dis-appointed by the decision to turn the space into a bar because there are already so many drink venues in Midtown.
Coller said he usually ate at Munchies be-
cause it was convenient, and now that it’s mov-ing, he said he’ll miss the Dankalicious Chicken Nugs, which he said were his favorite.20, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 21, 2013

� ROUTE 39 WILL STOP RUNNING AT 3:30 P.M.
EMILY BUCHANAN
Alligator Contributing Writer
Santa Fe College students may ﬁ  nd 
it harder to catch a ride on RTS bus 
route 39.
RTS slated three primary changes, 
wrote  RTS Transit Planner Matthew Muller in an email. The service will run more frequently but in a condensed window of time, and it will enter cam-pus on a different street, he said. 
The old route, which ran every 90 
minutes,  will begin running every 60 minutes. It previously ran until 5:45 p.m., but under the new schedule, it will terminate at 3:30 p.m. and will en-ter campus from Northwest 83rd Street, instead of Northwest 91st Street. 
The changes are coming about be-cause Route 39 has been funded by Santa Fe and the Florida Department of Transportation, said RTS spokes-man Chip Skinner. The FDOT’s fund-ing share has recently expired making Santa Fe the sole provider for the route, he said.
“The FDOT originally funded the 
route for a two-year term as a demon-stration project, and Santa Fe did not want to increase their per-credit-hour tuition fee,” he said. “So in order to maintain their funding level, we had to stop the route a little earlier, but also in-crease the frequency. This was a sink or swim time for that particular route.”
Victoria Swander, a 21-year-old 
SFC anthropology junior, said she was surprised about the route change. 
“That’s going to be rough on stu-
dents like myself that don’t have a ve-hicle and depend on the bus to get to class,” she said.
Although Route 39 was not failing, 
Skinner said the changes were needed.
“The route was performing well but 
not up to our expectations,” said Skin-ner.SFC bus route shortenedLOCAL

Ted Spiker arrived on campus,

walked to his office in Weimer Hall.
But as he passed the James W. “Bill” 
Heavener Football Complex, he noticed a man with a saw cutting into brick.
“Every once in a while, I’ve passed 
[Aaron Hernandez’s brick] and thought, ‘Gosh, what’s going to hap-pen with this?’” said the UF journalism professor.
By removing the former Gator’s 
commemorative All-America brick from outside the Heavener Football Complex. UF distanced itself from Her-nandez, who is pleading not guilty to first-degree murder and five firearms-related charges. 
The University Athletic Association 
released a statement shortly after im-ages of the brick removal went viral announcing removal of Hernandez me-mentos from campus areas, including the South Endzone team area, Heaven-er Football Complex, Kornblau Lobby and the brick display entrance to the football facility.
“We didn’t feel it was appropriate to 
celebrate Aaron Hernandez,” the state-ment said. “We put together an imme-diate plan after the initial news broke to remove his likeness and name in various private and public areas in the facility … We were able to implement some of the changes immediately, and this [brick removal] was a more com-plex process to complete with our ven-dors. The plan was to have everything completed before the end of July.”22, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 21, 2013

Students receiving Bright Futures schol-
arships have it a little easier this upcoming 
year.
Those who receive the merit-based schol-
arship will no longer be required to fill out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid form, or FAFSA, in order to obtain it.
A bill signed April 20 by Gov. Rick Scott 
changed the previous law from May 2011 that required students to fill out a FAFSA form.
“Several thousands of students will be af-
fected by this,” said Rick Wilder, director of the UF Office for Student Financial Affairs.
Wilder said this change allows students 
who are only interested in the Bright Futures scholarship to avoid an extra step if they do not need other financial aid. 
“A number of students … will not have 
to fill out an unnecessary administrative re-quirement to receive something based on aca-demic rather than need,” Wilder said. 
David Pritchard, a 21-year-old UF envi-
ronmental science senior, said it’s less time-consuming not to have to fill out a FAFSA form in order to receive something that has already been promised.
“It’s one less thing to worry about,” said 
Brittany Novak, a 19-year-old UF food science and human nutrition sophomore, “especially because my dad has been on my back about filling it out.”FAFSA not tied

Titletown can now add a new 
accolade to its list of claims to fame, 
and it’s pretty sweet, dude. 
Real estate website www.estate-
ly.com recently named Gainesville as the No. 3 city in the United States for bros. 
The website’s criterion for bros includes “males between the ages of 16-25 … seemingly stuck in an awk-ward and extended puberty. These young men are easily identiﬁ  ed by their shaved chests, perpetual pos-turing and false bravado,” the post reads. 
Some of the reasons Estately 
chose Gainesville for third place include the city’s No. 10 “douchi-est school” award from GQ Maga-zine, Ryan Lochte’s prominence and NPR’s labeling him the “ultimate bro.”The ﬁ  rst and second cities for 
bros are Los Angeles and Colum-bus, Ohio, respectively.
Billy Harris, an accounting junior 
at UF and member of Kappa Sigma, said he agrees the stereotype is alive and well in Gainesville, although it isn’t limited to fraternities.
“I think of a guy that’s young and 
doesn’t have a lot of cares,” he said.
Ilan Shrira, UF social psychol-
ogy expert who currently teaches at Loyola University in Chicago, said he anticipated bro culture would be stronger in southern cities, he said.
“That kind of subculture maybe 
would be stronger in the traditional South because you have more focus on fraternities,” he said.
Tyler Blair, a 20-year-old UF civil 
engineering junior and Delta Tau Delta member, said he more-or-less agreed when the website called Gainesville “a total brotopia.”
“I’d say it’s a little extreme,” he 
said. “But it’s also really suitable for bro life just because there’s plenty of places to hang out and go out and relax.”
While the website emphasizes 
some negative qualities of the sub-culture, 20-year-old Chris Sposito, a UF economics junior and Pi Kappa Alpha member, said he sees it as something that symbolizes a special bond between men in a fraternity. 
“I generally think of it positive-
ly,” he said. “Sometimes being a bro and having bros means a lot of times you’ve gone through a lot of the same things and shared experiences. That’s what makes you bros.”

The 2013 hurricane season is in full swing, and experts are predicting serious storms.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration’s Atlantic hurricane season 
outlook estimated a 70 percent likelihood of up to 20 named storms, of which up to 11 could become hurricanes — including up to six Category 3s, 4s or 5s. The average, accord-ing to its website, is 12 named storms, six hur-ricanes and three major ones.
“This hurricane season is expected to 
be more severe than past years,” said Mike Spranger, a UF Institute of Food and Agricul-tural Sciences professor in family, youth and community sciences who created a handbook about preparing for natural disasters. 
UF emergency management coordinator 
Kenneth Allen said people should prepare by creating emergency evacuation plans, buy-ing supplies and stocking up on at least three days’ worth of food and water. In the event of a hurricane at UF, Allen said, on-campus resi-dents living in dorms should follow the advice of their housing staff. Off-campus residents should follow guidelines from local ofﬁ  cials.
“The university is constantly working to 
keep the students, faculty and staff as safe and well-prepared as we can,” Allen said.
UF will only cancel classes and close cam-
pus if there is a real danger, spokesman Steve Orlando said.This year’s hurricane season predicted to be a stormy one

In an effort to cater to out-of-towners 
and extend the event’s scope, organiz-
ers of the Gainesville-based music fes-tival announced the 12th annual Fest will begin with a pre-party in Ybor City this year, extending the festival by two days.
It will run the standard four days in 
Gainesville, from Oct. 31 to Nov. 3. The pre-party in Ybor City – added this year – will be Oct. 29-30, offering shows by many of the same bands at discounted prices.
Fest organizer Tony Weinbender 
said adding the days to the front end made sense because it catered to out-of-towners who often arrive early anyway.
“A lot are from overseas, coming as early as Wednesday,” he said. “That was an easy move to extend it.”
Weinbender also said coordinating 
logistics in Tampa was a natural choice because the circles of people often al-ready overlap.
“The Tampa music scene is very close 
to the Gainesville scene,” he said.
Pat Lavery, who handles booking 
for Fest venue High Dive, said the Fest extension could present pros and cons locally because business is more spread out.
“Now, it appears Fest goers will have 
two or three times the number of op-tions,” he said in an email interview. “If it means a lower turnout for the Fest in Gainesville and smaller crowds for each participating venue, then that could mean a negative ﬁ  nancial impact to the Gainesville community.”
As for drawing attendees away from 
Gainesville, Weinbender said he’s not worried. For many, he said, rocking at Fest in its city of origin is one of a kind.
“People like the experience,” he said. 
“It’s kind of a rite of passage.”24, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 21, 2013

Gator Growl 2013 will be a little different.
Organizers announced The Fray, Sister Ha-
zel and New Directions Veterans Choir will play the 90th Gator Growl on Nov. 8. Unlike most years, no comedian is scheduled.
Students like UF sports management soph-
omore Chase Funk, 19, are speculating Tracy Morgan’s vulgarity during last year’s show in-ﬂ  uenced producers’ choices for 2013.
Funk also criticized the talent choices for 
Gator Growl.
“[Before,] you had household names like 
Dave Chappelle, Gabriel Iglesias, Daniel Tosh,” he said. “The Fray would have been really cool if it was 2008.”
Funk said Sister Hazel’s appearance will 
probably draw older alumni to Gator Growl. The Fray targets the younger — but still gradu-ated — crowd. He said new and current stu-dents have little to look forward to for perfor-mances. 
Gator Growl public relations director Alys-
sa Fagien said although the alumni are heavily considered, the interests of current UF students are still important when choosing talent.
“You are always going to have people that 
are disappointed,” she said. “I personally am really excited for this year.”
Public relations freshman Nayara Brito-
Estrada, 17, said she will be spending the four-day Homecoming weekend in Orlando at the Electric Daisy Carnival.
“Why would I go to Gator Growl when I 
could go to EDC?” she said. “It’s more expen-sive, yeah, but there are just so many more art-ists I like there.”
Fagien said that although EDC can be ap-
pealing, techno events happen frequently. Growl is only once a year.
But ticket prices have gone up — for stu-
dents, it now costs $17 to attend Gator Growl. Guests tickets are $27.
Producer Megan Harmon said the $2 price 
raise was routine. She said people should know they’re paying for an excellent concert — one they’ll have a good time attending.Gator Growl 2013 changed up Fest 2013 expands, extends

Ziva Recek was as good as anyone 
could have expected in 2012.
As a freshman, Recek led the Gators 
with four kills per set and was named 
the Southeastern Conference Freshman of the Year, the AVCA Freshman of the Year and was selected to the All-SEC team.
After that kind of year, how could a 
player improve?
“Be a sophomore,” coach Mary Wise 
said.
The 6-foot outside hitter brought in 
the accolades after her ﬁ  rst season, but this year she wants to bring home na-tional hardware.
“We have a really good team this 
year,” Recek said. “We want to keep playing as long as we can.”
Recek said she has put a lot of work 
into improving for her second season of college volleyball. 
She has a lot to live up to. She led the 
team in kills with 440 in 2012, topping middle blocker Chloe Mann’s total of 380. “I was just doing a lot of individual 
work and taking all the reps in the gym,” Recek said. “Whenever I had a chance to swing the ball, I want to do my best.”
However, the word is out about Flori-
da’s European threat. 
“The difference will be Ziva will not 
take anybody by surprise anymore,” Wise said. “She will be the highlight on … everyone’s scouting report.”
It took Recek some time to adjust to 
living in the U.S. and playing with UF, but she said she feels more comfortable on and off the court — including ﬁ  nding American food she enjoys. 
“Americans … have good Italian res-
taurants,” she said. “That’s kind of like what I used to eat at home.” 
Recek had a chance to showcase her 
talent at a high level after the season end-ed. She went to her native Slovenia and played for the Slovenian National Team.
Recek said she thought a match be-
tween the Slovenian team and the Florida team would be tightly contested, but she knows which side she would choose.
“I’d be on the UF team,” Recek said.Contact Adam Lichtenstein at alichten-

With its season opener against Flor-
ida Gulf Coast just two days away, the 
Florida soccer team has a new core ready to lead the team.
The end of the 2012 season saw se-
niors Erika Tymrak, Jo Dragotta, Kat Williamson and Holly King graduate and begin careers in professional soc-cer. Mckenzie Barney also graduated.
The ﬁ  ve combined for 27 goals and 
21 assists last season.
Seniors Maggie Rogers, Caroline 
Triglia, Taylor Travis and Haley Reeb will take on an increased role this sea-son. Each adds something unique to the team. 
“It’s a lot of shoes to ﬁ  ll; I think it 
will take a while to replace them,” ju-nior midﬁ  elder Havana Solaun said. “As a group we ﬁ  ll Holly’s shoes. We ﬁ  ll Kat’s shoes. It’s not just one person stepping up.”
Coach Becky Burleigh said she ex-pects returning players to blaze their own trail rather than try to replace de-parted players.
“You have to lead within your own 
personality and your own strengths,” Burleigh said. “We’re asking our play-ers to be self-aware and know their own strengths and really be smart about how they lead within those strengths.”
In Florida’s 
exhibition game against UCF on Fri-day, Burleigh saw 
her team’s weaknesses exposed, but she was also pleased with progress that was made.
After losing 2-0 to the fast-paced 
and aggressive Knights, Burleigh said the contrasting style of play was problematic for the Gators’ defense — something that must be resolved be-fore the start of the regular season. 
“We have to bring a bigger physical 
presence defensively,” she said. “Of-fensively, our shape was part of the problem. We were too narrow, and in soccer, you want to make the ﬁ  eld big whenever we have the ball.”
Despite the loss, Burleigh said the 
team has shown positive strides.
“They’ve shown when we’ve 
thrown something tough at them they’ve been able to handle that,” she said. “At the same time they’ve shown the ability to have some composure. Those are two big factors and switch-ing between the two is the hardest part.”
Florida’s opener against FGCU on 
Friday is the ﬁ  rst of three consecutive home games to start the season.
The last time the two teams met, 
the Gators won 2-0 to advance to the second round of the 2012 NCAA tour-nament. 
The Eagles failed to attempt a shot 
on goal during the game — the only such occurrence against the Gators last season.
Rogers expects a quick opening to 
the season with home advantage, stat-ing: “Start strong, ﬁ  nish stronger.”

Florida lost several defensive 
standouts to the NFL, but it has one 
weapon who did not see the field last year — junior Ronald Powell.
Powell missed the entire 2012 
season after suffering a torn ACL in his left knee during the Orange and Blue Game. But through the first three weeks of fall camp, Powell is quickly getting back to his old self.
“I feel like I’m moving fast, mov-
ing as well anybody out there,” Powell said.
Powell used his quickness to lead 
Florida with six sacks in 2011, his last full season. The Gators need him to return to that form if they want to improve their pass rush. 
UF finished ninth in the South-
eastern Conference in sacks in 2012.
“We know what he can do,” de-
fensive coordinator D.J. Durkin said on Aug. 14. “We’ve seen it before but it’s always that, ‘OK, let’s see how he comes back off the injury.’”
Powell said he learned more 
about himself while recovering from the injury. He was on track to return during the season before suffering a setback in September. 
“Especially when you’re going 
through something as hard as that, you never thought you would go through … you got to strap up and take it on full speed,” he said.
Powell looked promising during 
Florida’s open practices during fall camp, blowing by offensive linemen in drills and scrimmages. 
“(He makes) a big difference be-
cause he’s so physical,” linebacker Neiron Ball said. “He’s such a big guy he definitely can set the edge for us.”
Powell said his knee has been ab-
sorbing contact during practices, and he has not had any issues. The only problems he has had are reminding himself about hand placement and keeping his feet moving.
“He had a lot of anxiety about 
coming back,” Durkin said. “He’s doing really well out there, been in contact drills and doing great. Look-ing forward to him getting out on the field.”
Sophomore Dante Fowler Jr. 
helped fill the hole left by Powell’s absence last season. This year the two will see plenty of time on the field together. Both are listed at the hybrid Buck position and will play on the line and at linebacker.
“We can be in nickel, we can be 
in regular,” Powell said. “I’m going to put my hand on the ground, I’m going to be standing up, kind of like it was when I was on the field two years ago.”
Fowler played in all of UF’s 13 
games last year, recording 30 tack-les, including eight for losses. He notched 2.5 sacks last year.
“Six and seven off the edge,” 
Powell said, referring to his and Fowler’s numbers. “A lot of getting to the QB.”
Florida  will have its first look 
at Powell when he takes the field against Toledo on Aug. 31. “We’re seeing the flashes of No. 7 to say, ‘Alright, we got what we think we had,” Durkin said.

As a walk-on freshman running back in 
2012, Mark Herndon went to bed hungry 
many nights.
Without a scholarship, and coming from 
a family who he says struggles financially, Herndon survived on Pop Tarts and Ramen Noodles last season. 
But he will no longer have to wonder where 
his next meal is coming from. Herndon was one of two Gators who was awarded a schol-arship following practice Tuesday afternoon. He can now eat with the rest of the team. 
“It brought tears to my eyes,” Herndon 
said. “The first thing I did was call my mom and tell her. She was ecstatic about it.” 
Tim Clark, a safety who is entering his 
fifth season, had his scholarship renewed for a third season.
“I thought that said a lot about our coaches for honoring that commitment to me,” Clark said. “It’s really been a blessing.”
Herndon, who is an Ocala native, does not 
fit the typical mold of a walk-on finally earn-ing a scholarship. He played in six games last season, mostly on special teams, but could be counted on even more early in the season.
Starting running back 
Matt Jones battled a seri-ous viral infection in the offseason and has not prac-ticed with the team. For as long as Jones remains out, Herndon will be the No. 2 running back behind Mack 
Brown. 
“Me and Matt are teammates, so we talk 
and hang out,” Herndon said. “I was sad, but if he’s down, I gotta step up because the team needs me. That’s what I did.”
Florida now has 83 scholarship players on 
the roster. The NCAA limit is 85. Ball moving outside: Neiron Ball has had a 
tumultuous past two seasons.
In 2011, he was diagnosed with an arte-
riovenous malformation (AVM), a congenital condition that led to the tangling of blood ves-sels in his brain. He returned last season but was bothered by an ankle injury while adjust-ing to being back on the field. 
Now healthy, Ball will be a critical piece in 
Florida’s defense at a new position. After play-ing primarily inside during the past two sea-sons, Ball will be the starting Will linebacker, a position most recently filled by Jelani Jenkins. 
Ball will have extensive coverage responsi-
bilities, a role he is confident he can fill. 
“I actually like [the Will linebacker spot] 
better than the Sam position,” Ball said. “I feel like it fits me because I get to move around a lot more, and I can use my speed a lot more.”
According to coach Will Muschamp, Mike 
Taylor (Mike linebacker) and Ronald Powell (Sam linebacker) will join Ball in the starting linebacker rotation until Antonio Morrison re-turns from suspension.
Showers running: Even with Jones cur-
rently unavailable at running back, it would appear the Gators have good depth at the posi-tion. Valdez Showers, who switched positions from safety to running back this offseason, is the team’s No. 3 tailback with Jones out.
When asked about the running back totem 
pole on Monday, Muschamp said Showers was ahead of highly touted freshmen Kelvin Taylor and Adam Lane, who have each strug-gled with ball security and pass protection.
Showers is behind Brown and Herndon on 
the depth chart.
“He’s got great top-end speed,” Muschamp 
said of Showers. “He’s got really good ball skills. He can do a lot of different things for us as far as lining up at receiver (and) lining up in the backfield.”

Sydney Moss attempts a layup during Florida’s 87-54 victory 
against Alabama at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center on Feb. 3.Editor’s note: A version of this 
story originally ran June 20. Sydney Moss has since decided to transfer to Thomas More College.
PHIL HEILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer
Sydney Moss dealt the Gators a 
painful blow when she announced 
on Tuesday that she would not be returning to the Florida women’s basketball program next season.
Moss is 
one of three UF players — along with Chan-
dler Cooper and Vicky McIntyre — to leave the program this offseason. 
Understandably, Amanda But-
ler and her coaching staff hoped to hold onto their star player. Sources told the Alligator that Butler and her staff flew to West Virginia ear-lier this month hoping to convince Moss to reconsider her decision to leave the program. Moss urged the group not to make the flight and did not change her mind. 
Both Moss and McIntyre con-
firmed their decisions to leave the Gators basketball program on Tues-day. 
In her only season with the 
Gators, Moss was second on the team in scoring, averaging 11.8 points per game. She overcame a midseason slump to carry the Gators to the Final Four of the WNIT and showed a level of poise that made her a strong candidate to develop into an All-Southeastern Conference caliber player as a sophomore next season.
“Sydney wants to be close to 
her mom and home. We wish her, Chandler and Vicky the best,” coach Amanda Butler said.
Moss figures to be the biggest 
loss of the offseason. Her greatest strength is the ability to fill up a box score. Often the team’s best offen-sive threat, she managed to add 6.8 rebounds and 3.9 assists per contest during the season.
Moss was named to the 2013 All-
SEC Freshman Team and the 2013 postseason WNIT All-Tournament Team for her performance.
McIntyre, a 6-foot-7 center, 
would have been a senior in 2013-14. She played just one season at UF after transferring from Oklahoma State, where she spent her first two collegiate seasons.
In 2011, two coaches on staff 
at Oklahoma State were killed in a plane crash while traveling on a recruiting trip. After the season, McIntyre chose to look for a fresh start and ended up at Florida, where she averaged 4.8 points and 3.8 re-bounds while playing in 29 games, including three starts. However, 
McIntyre did not play in any of Florida’s postseason games. 
Neither she nor Butler offered 
any reasoning for her absence at the time, and McIntyre’s decision to leave the program was somewhat expected.Earlier this month, Cooper con-
firmed her intention to transfer from Florida to Lipscomb University. Cooper explained the decision as an opportunity to be closer to home — she is from Clarksville, Tenn. — while also playing basketball in a smaller environment.
However, Cooper cited several 
other factors that weighed into her decision, including a level of dissen-sion within the program, especially among some of the team’s younger players and the coaching staff.
The three departures come in 
stark contrast to the direction the program was seemingly headed.
After a disappointing regular 
season in 2012-13, Florida’s run in the WNIT offered hope heading into next season. Moss was projected to continue developing into an All-SEC caliber player. She would have been joined by transfers Cassie Peoples and Antoinette Bannister — each a highly rated prospect coming out of high school — as well as freshman Ronni Williams, a McDonald’s High School All-American who has the potential to become Florida’s most talented player in school history.
Those four, along with the ex-
pected return of Viktorija Dimaite, — who has missed the past two seasons due to injury — and losing only one player, Jennifer George, to graduation, had expectations sur-rounding the program as high as they have been in some time.

  The season started well.
  Florida won three of its ﬁ  rst four 
games, including a 16-5 blowout of Duke to clinch the ﬁ  rst series of the season in front of 3,581 fans at McKethan Stadium.
  Then, the ﬁ  rst losing streak hit. 
Florida lost a midweek game to Georgia Southern in extra innings before being swept by Florida Gulf Coast — a team Florida had beaten in six of their seven prior meetings.
  “It’s a long season,” senior Cody 
Dent said after the sweep. 
  It only got longer.  The Gators fell to 3-7 to start 
the season after losing three games to the Eagles, a midweek game to North Florida and the series opener to Miami. Florida wouldn’t crawl back over .500 until April 12.
  Nothing went well for the 
Gators in the ﬁ  rst months of the season. Pitching was hard to ﬁ  nd. Junior Jonathon Crawford strug-gled to ﬁ  nd consistency. In his ﬁ  rst six starts of the season, he gave up three, zero, eight, nine, three and 12 hits. He didn’t notch his ﬁ  rst win of the season until he blanked Ole Miss in a complete-game shutout on March 30.
  Despite being the only upper-
classman starter on the team, he was demoted to the No. 2 spot in the rotation in March.
  The the other starters struggled 
as well.
  Freshman Jay Carmichael 
moved from the bullpen to the ro-tation and eventually became the team’s No. 1 starter after a string of solid outings, but he battled through arm injuries for the next month.
  Eric Hanhold, Bobby Poyner, Tucker Simpson and Danny Young all made seven or more starts and had ﬂ  ashes of brilliance, but none could make a lasting impact as starters. Coach Kevin O’Sullivan shuttled them back and forth be-tween the rotation and the bull-pen.
  “The thing that’s most disap-
pointing up to this point is I don’t think we’ve seen the improvement with some players we thought we would,” O’Sullivan said.
  The situation was just as dire in 
the starting lineup. 
  With the exodus of most of the 
2012 team to professional baseball, the Gators had many holes to ﬁ  ll. Some underclassmen ﬁ  lled their roles well.
  Freshman Richie Martin came in 
to replace Nolan Fontana at short-stop. He started the season well be-fore suffering a ﬁ  nger injury. When he came back, he moved to the out-ﬁ  eld, leaving Dent and his sub-.200 average in the starting lineup at shortstop.
  Fellow ﬁ  rst-year Harrison Bader 
hit above .300 and provided speed on the base paths, leading the team with 15 steals.
  But the power was never there.  Sophomore Taylor Gushue 
needed to ﬁ  ll the exceptionally large cleats of Mike Zunino, and he didn’t. He ﬁ  nished the year with ﬁ  ve home runs – four fewer than Zunino hit in any season at Flori-da.
 “We got to get better offensive-
ly,” O’Sullivan said. “We have not put good swings in offensive counts and did enough damage there.”
  For a stretch in April, it looked 
like Florida had ﬁ  nally put it to-gether. The Gators beat the Semi-noles on the road and swept the Gamecocks at home. They won 11 out of 12 games to jump out to a 25-19 record by April 27. 
  But it was not meant to be.   LSU swept Florida in Baton 
Rouge, and UF limped its way into the Southeastern Conference  Tournament after losing four of its last six. The team did not win a game in the postseason, losing the opener of the SEC Tournament and going home after two games in the NCAA Bloomington Regional – the earliest exit for Florida since 2008. O’Sullivan was not satisﬁ  ed.
  “This season is not the standard 
we want at Florida,” O’Sullivan said. “There’s no rebuilding at Florida … We’ve got young play-ers, but it’s time to grow up.”

  After a ﬁ  ve-and-a-half-hour, 15-in-
ning win against Nebraska on Saturday 
night, Florida had little left to give in its next contest.
  Backed by a strong showing from 
pitcher Blaire Luna and timely hits from its lineup, No. 4 seed Texas (51-9) coasted to a 3-0 win over second-seeded Florida (58-9) on Sunday in Oklahoma City, eliminating the Gators from the Women’s College World Series.
  “We came out with a lot of energy, 
more than I expected,” junior Hannah Rogers said. “Everyone came out ready to ﬁ  ght. I mean, we just were struggling a little bit at the plate. But they did a great job today, Texas did.”
  Offense was hard to come by for UF 
as Blaire Luna controlled the strike zone from start to ﬁ  nish. 
She tossed 141 pitches while frustrat-
ing a Gators offense that could do little with its one single.
  Luna struck out 14 batters in seven 
innings en route to her 13th shutout of the season. The Longhorns senior found similar success in Texas’ 6-3 win against Arizona State on Thursday, striking out 10 Sun Devils and allowing only four hits.
   “She threw 60 balls,” coach Tim 
Walton said. “How many strikes did we swing at? And how many good pitches did we take? That’s the M.O. of a good pitcher.”
  Texas’ bats that put the contest out 
of Florida’s reach midway through the elimination game.
  With one out in a scoreless affair, Tex-
as’ designated hitter Kim Bruins belted a three-RBI home run over the left-ﬁ  eld wall to put the Longhorns ahead 3-0 in the third. Rogers was unable to work ahead early in the count versus a Texas’ lineup loaded with power and speed. She surrendered the homer after falling behind in the count 2-1.
In the bottom half of the inning,   Flor-
ida found itself in a position to respond to Texas’ offensive surge.
  Luna hit both Briana Little and Kirsti 
Merritt with pitches, putting runners on ﬁ  rst and second with two outs in the bot-tom of the third. Luna gave Florida an-other free pass in the next at-bat, walk-ing Stephanie Tofft to load the bases and bringing up Lauren Haeger.

Florida quarterback Jeff Driskel underwent 
appendectomy surgery on Tuesday, the team 
announced. 
“Jeff had acute appendicitis and fortunately 
the medical staff caught it very quickly,” Mus-champ said in a press release.
Coach Will Muschamp said the amount of 
time Driskel will miss will be based on how he recovers from the surgery, which he said could be up to about two weeks.
Driskel is expected to start at quarterback 
this season. Last year, he threw for 1,646 yards and 12 touchdowns while tossing ﬁ  ve intercep-tions. Driskel also ran for more than 400 yards.
The Gators begin fall training camp on Fri-
day. Driskel could return before Aug. 15 – the ﬁ  rst of the Gators’ four fall practices open to the public.
Other quarterbacks on Florida’s roster in-
clude junior Tyler Murphy and redshirt fresh-man Skyler Mornhinweg. Neither have thrown an in-game pass for the Gators.
Cooper says slur: On Wednesday, Crossing-
Broad.com released a video of former Gators and current Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper using a racial slur during a Kenny Chesney concert on June 8 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia.“I will jump that fence and ﬁ  ght every n----r 
here,” Cooper says in the 20-second clip.
Cooper soon apologized for his actions via 
his Twitter account (@RileyCooper_14).
“I am so ashamed and disgusted with my-
self,” Cooper wrote. “I want to apologize. I have been offensive. I have apologized to my coach, (Philadelphia Eagles owner) Jeffrey Lurie, and (general manager) Howie Roseman and to my teammates. I owe an apology to the fans and to this community. I am so ashamed, but there are no excuses. What I did was wrong and I will accept the consequences.”
Cooper held a press 
conference on Wednes-day night and said he was drinking at the con-
cert. He also said the team ﬁ  ned him “a good amount of money.”
With Jeremy Maclin sidelined for the year 
with an ACL tear, Cooper is expected to be the Eagles’ No. 2 receiver this season. 
Leak joins offensive staff: Two months af-
ter joining the Florida coaching staff as a qual-ity control coach, former Gators quarterback Chris Leak was named a graduate assistant on Wednesday.
Leak was Florida’s starting quarterback 
from 2003 to 2006. He is the all-time leader in quarterback starts (47) and passing yards (11,213).
Leak won the national title game MVP after 
Florida defeated Ohio State 41-14 in the 2007 BCS National Championship Game.

There weren’t any controversial 
stick checks or overtime periods.
But there was the end of an era.
For the second straight year, Syra-
cuse (18-3) ended Florida’s (18-3) sea-son, as the Gators lost 13-9 on Satur-day in the Carrier Dome in the NCAA Tournament quarterfinals.
It was the final time the 13 Gators 
seniors took the field — 10 of whom had been with the team for the entirety of the program’s four-year existence and committed to UF before the school even had its own field.
“This is obviously a disappointing 
way to end their career,” coach Aman-da O’Leary said. “But at the same time, we’ve got to be so proud of what they’ve accomplished and what they brought to the university.”
Last season, Syracuse erased a 12-5 
second-half Florida lead to force over-time in the NCAA semifinals in Stony Brook, N.Y. 
The Gators looked to have won the 
game on a free-position shot from at-tacker Gabi Wiegand in the final sec-onds of the first overtime. 
But the goal was called back after 
the Orange called a stick check and her stick pocket was ruled illegal. Af-ter winning the opening draw of the second overtime, Syracuse scored on the first possession to advance to the championship.
On Saturday, the Orange controlled 
the ball for the first four minutes and jumped out to a 2-0 lead. The Gators scored their way back into the game for remainder of first half as seniors Kitty Cullen and Gabi Wiegand and sophomore Nora Barry notched goals to take the lead,. The defense did not allow a goal for an 18-minute stretch.  
Freshman 
midfielder Kel-ly Cross broke S y r a c u s e ’ s 
scoring drought at the 8:34 mark of the first half, and both teams scored once more to make it 4-4 at halftime. 
However, that was as close as the 
game would get. Orange freshman and All-American Kayla Treanor scored 53 seconds into the second half to give Syracuse the lead for good.
Although the Class of 2013 Gators 
did not advance to the Final Four as they did during their junior season, O’Leary said Saturday’s loss couldn’t tarnish the importance of their four years in Gainesville.
 “They represented us in the best 
possible manner and will always hold a special place in my heart,” O’Leary said. “They put us on the map.”

  Against all odds, the Gators are outdoor 
champions for the second consecutive season. 
  The Florida men’s track and ﬁ  eld team ral-
lied Saturday to defend its NCAA outdoor 
title, this time sharing it with Texas A&M.
   “No one gave us a chance,” coach Mike 
Holloway said. “I watched the replays of ESPN this weekend and they didn’t even mention the Gators. I told the guys to just keep ﬁ  ghting, be who we are and do what we do.”
UF was in 11th place heading into the last 
day of competition.
  After disappointing results through the 
ﬁ  rst three days of competition, the odds of Florida defending its title dwindled.  
  The ﬁ  rst scored event on Saturday was the 
men’s triple jump. Defending NCAA champi-on Omar Craddock made the cut to advance to the ﬁ  nal jumps, while sophomore Marquis Dendy fell short.
  Having two individual athletes and two 
relay squads still eligible for points, the Gators went to work — starting with Craddock.
  The senior posted a per-
sonal best in the triple jump and secured 10 points for Florida, defending his indi-
vidual title.   
  The next event for Flor-
ida was the men’s 4x100m 
relay. In the ﬁ  nal leg of the 4x1, sophomore Dedric Dukes edged out Alabama’s Dushane Farrier by one-hundredth of a second, win-ning the event for Florida in a season-best 38.53 seconds. 
  “I knew the title was on the line, so I just ran my hardest and we came out on top,” Hugh Graham Jr. said. 
“All the handoffs were smooth, and down 
the backstretch, I knew Dedric was one of the best guys out there and he would get it done for us.”
 The penultimate event on Saturday for the 
Gator men was the 110m hurdles. With a time of 13.32 seconds, junior Eddie Lovett earned eight crucial points in a runner-up ﬁ  nish to Texas A&M’s Wayne Davis II. 
 Florida found itself down by nine points 
to No. 1 ranked Texas A&M with one event remaining – the men’s 4x400m relay.
