least try to hide it from authorities. One man in central Florida 
was allegedly growing the plants in his front yard. Agents with the Osceola County Investigative Bureau arrested and charged Bryan Hartman on Monday for cultivation of cannabis. Au-thorities said Hartman had 17 marijuana plants — some as big as seven feet — that could “easily be seen from the roadway.”
The roots were growing in planters in the front of his St. 
Cloud house, just south of Orlando. Hartman was booked into the Osceola County Jail.

UF researchers can now get up 
close and personal with shallow-wa-
ter sharks.
A team of UF alumni came togeth-
er to donate a boat for the Florida 
Program for Shark Research.
The CEO of the Guy Harvey Ocean 
Foundation, the president of Hell’s 
Bay Boatworks Inc. and the president of Benedict Advertising in Daytona Beach donated a boat to enable the program’s shark research in shallow waters to continue.
George Burgess, the director of the 
FPSR, said the boat could not have come at a better time for the pro-gram.“We’re about to embark on a series 
of projects in the Florida Bays and Florida Keys,” Burgess said.
The program has needed a flat 
boat in order to get into the shallower waters and perform the necessary re-search on the fish that inhabit them, Burgess said.
The program’s new 
boat is valued at more than $50,000. It is an 18-foot, custom-made flat 
boat used in shallow marine habitats. It has a custom railing to enable the 
researchers to work close to the water 
and a side-mounted steering console to provide more space for the research team.
Steve Stock, CEO of Guy Harvey 
Ocean Foundation and an alumnus of UF, started talking with Chris Pe-
terson, president of Hell’s Bay Boat-
works Inc., another UF alumnus, about the possibility of making a do-nation to the program. 
Both the Guy Harvey Ocean Foun-
dation and Hell’s Bay Boatworks Inc. are clients of Benedict Advertising in Daytona Beach, which is owned by Michael Benedict, another alumnus.
Benedict and Burgess had dis-
cussed the need for  a flat boat to con-duct the program’s research.
“It was really a confluence of The 
Gator Nation that kind of pulled us together and said, ‘Hey, let’s do this,’”  Peterson said.
Peterson said all three men knew 
the program was in desperate need 
of this particular type of boat, and to-

Two months ago, Renee Gork was known 
to the sports world as the woman who wore 
the wrong hat to work and found herself out 
of a job.
Now, she’s found a job that will allow her 
to show her true colors: or -
ange and blue. 
Gork, a UF graduate, was 
fired in August from her position as a radio host for KAKS in Arkansas  after at-
tending a news conference 
with Arkansas head football coach Bobby Petrino while 
wearing a UF hat. But on Monday she was hired to work on WRUF Sports Radio 850 in

Stadium Club, the partially constructed luxury condomini-
um building on University Avenue across from Ben Hill Griffin 
Stadium, will be auctioned today . 
The building is one of seven foreclosures for sale at an auc-
tion at 11 a.m. in the lobby of the Alachua County Courthouse.
The .24-acre lot at 1802 W. University Ave. was purchased 
for $2.1 million in February 2007, according to Alachua County Property Appraiser’s records.
The project was to include 24 luxury condominiums, eight 
stories tall. The first floor would have had retail stores. 
V esta Equity LLC, an investment fund based in Sarasota, 
bought the remaining loan on the building in February 2009.
According to county records, $2.6 million is owed to Vesta 
Equity. Irwin Contracting is owed $200,000.
George Kruse, managing director of V esta Equity , said there 
isn’t much information about the auction. 
He said he hasn’t received any calls about bids. “Nobody 
shows their cards ahead of time,” he said, adding that he ex-pects the auction to take no more than ten minutes.Would-be condo

 Student Senators voted Tues-
day night to allocate $35,000 of 
Student Government reserve funds to improve safety at the Flavet Field Bandshell. 
  The money will be used to 
add a safety fence and a water line to the facility. 
  After arrests were made at 
a Slightly Stoopid concert in March, T.J. Villamil, chairman of the Budget and Appropria-tions Committee, said the band-shell cannot be used unless cer-
tain safety improvements are 
added.
  Villamil said because SG 
paid for the bandshell, it is SG’s responsibility to maintain it.
  The current chain-link fence 
around the bandshell will be re-moved, and a new fence with a center aisle will be added so po-
lice and medical staff can walk 
among the crowd if there is an emergency.
  Kevin Kleponis, senate 
leader for the Student Alliance party, proposed to postpone the vote until next week’s meeting so speciﬁ  c information could be obtained for what the money will be used for.
  “Throwing [$35,000] to these 
folks without a serious plan is a misuse of the students’ funds,” Kleponis said.
  Senator Jason Tiemeier, who 
represents the Unite Party, said the bill should be passed imme-diately so the bandshell can be used by students.
  “This is a mandatory thing 
that has to be done as soon as possible,” he said.
  The bill was passed.  Senators also voted to ap-
prove a bill reducing the SG-funded academics budget by about $60,000, which funds col-
lege academic 
councils. 
  With the 
passing of 
that bill, the Board of College 
Council’s budget was reduced by about $35,000. 
  “Because BOCC has had a 
history of not spending their money, it was decided that it 
would beneﬁ  t the students to 
cut their budget in half,” Vil-lamil said.
  Senators also voted to ap-
prove legislation allocating more than $3,000 to student or-ganizations.

 Students can shop for their Halloween 
decorations on campus this week. 
  The graphic design club Vox Graphis 
will be selling Halloween-themed paper 
items designed and printed by UF stu-
dents until Thursday on the Plaza of the Americas. 
  Vox Graphis, which means “the voice 
of graphic design,” is a group of design students at UF who participate in various 
graphic design showings and exhibits ev-ery year.
  There are six major styles of posters, 
eight styles of cards and eight small prints with bicycle themes on sale.   The sale will be going on from 11 a.m. 
to 3 p.m. each day.
  The posters cost between $2 and $5 and 
cards are $1.
  All the funds raised will go toward Lig-ature 20, a design symposium scheduled for February  next year. 
  Vox Graphics raised between $100 and 
$200 last year, said Melanie Richards, president of the organization. 
  Richards said she gets excited when 
people buy the holiday-themed cards and 
posters the group sells every year. 
  “I love to see people get joy from the 
items our members create,” Richards 
said.  Design students sell Halloween-themed paper goods
“I love to see people get joy from 
the items our members create.”

The items cost between $1 and $5“This is territory that is very fa-
miliar to me,” said Gork. “I always 
was a Gator.”
She will be starting her new po-
sition Thursday, serving alongside Steve Russell on “Sportscene,” which airs weekdays from 6 a.m. 
to 10 a.m. She will also help stu-
dents with an interest in broad-casting get involved with intern-ships. 
Gork, who referred to the inci-
dent as a “wardrobe malfunction,” said she grabbed the hat without looking to cover her head from the rain outside.
The hat drew immediate atten-
tion from Petrino, who comment-ed on it after fielding a question from Gork.
“And that will be the last ques-
tion I answer with that hat on,” Petrino said. 
She admits that while wearing 
the hat to a press conference spon-
sored by a rival school may have 
not been the best judgment call, she believes it is possible for her to be objective while also being a sports fan.  
She said that the experience 
taught her the importance of be-ing careful with what she does and says in her work. 
“Obviously I won’t be wear -
ing any Razorback gear out,” she said. 
Randy Wright, the executive di-rector of the division of multime-dia properties at UF, who reached out to Gork following her firing, 
said that he has no reservations 
about hiring her, pointing out her ties to the university and the qual-ity of her work.
“I don’t think it was that hard 
[of a decision]; she’s a Gator 
through and through,” Wright 
said. 
“Renee made a mistake, but we 
know the quality of her character and the quality of her work.”
Wright, who called Gork’s fir -
ing from the Arkansas station “silly,”  said the timing of Gork’s hire is appropriate, especially this 
week.
“What better idea than to bring 
a Gator home for homecoming?” 
he said.
 Although Gork said she wasn’t 
sure about the exact format she will be following on her first broadcast Thursday, she expressed excite-ment about the prospect of cover -
ing Gators and SEC football.
“We’ll be rolling with the 
punches,” she said.THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
INDIANAPOLIS — Karen 
and Fred Lamb tried to do their 
homework before investing their savings in an Indiana company’s fund to help churches build 
or expand. After talking with 
church friends and checking out Alanar Inc. on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website, they decided the firm’s goals and beliefs meshed with their own.
“It was a good place where 
Christians would be investing in the work of other Christians,” 
said Karen Lamb, a 55-year-old 
Terre Haute, Ind., housewife.
More than five years later, 
the Lambs still are waiting to get most of their $53,000 investment back. 
Now a former pastor is going 
on trial for what authorities call a multimillion-dollar scheme that 
preyed on thousands of parish-
ioners who thought they were helping build churches but were actually buying the man and his sons planes and sports cars.
Vaughn Reeves, 66, faces 10 
counts of securities fraud. Jury selection began Tuesday in Princ-eton, Ind.
Authorities say Reeves, 
founder and owner of now-de-funct Alanar, and his three sons duped about 11,000 investors into buying bonds worth $120 
million secured by mortgages on 
construction projects at about 150 churches. 
The men diverted money from 
new investments to pay off previ-ous investors, pocketing $6 mil-lion and buying two airplanes, sports cars and vacations, accord-
ing to court records.
Officials say the scheme oper -ated mainly in Indiana, though 
church members in other states, 
including Florida, Michigan, 
Maryland and Oklahoma, also were victimized.
All four men have pleaded not 
guilty. An attorney for Vaughn Reeves did not return calls from The Associated Press seeking comment.
Experts say the Alanar case is 
a prime example of affinity fraud, in which scammers prey on peo-ple who share a common interest, such as religious affiliation, eth-nicity or even age.
The Security and Exchange 
Commission doesn’t track cases of affinity fraud separately, but Lori Schock, director of the agen-
cy’s Office of Investor Education 
and Advocacy, estimates inves-tors have lost hundreds of mil-lions of dollars to such schemes in the last two years.
Many victims never report the 
crimes because they are ashamed to tell authorities they’ve been duped, Schock said.
A warning on the SEC web-
site says schemes have targeted retirees, blacks, Jehovah’s Wit-nesses and Armenian-Americans. Schock said recent schemes have gone after bus drivers in Califor -
nia, Latin Americans in Miami and Mormons in Utah.4, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 13, 2010

When Bernice walks around on a 
game day , fans stop and say , “What 
a fat beagle!” 
Bernice’s owner, Sarah Jones, a 
third-year law student at UF, said 
that while her dog is on the heavy 
side, she’s not too concerned. Jones said she takes Bernie, 3, on her morn-ing runs every day and to local dog parks. But first, Bernice gets a break-fast of scrambled eggs and cheese.
“You feel bad and you want to 
feed them what they want,” she said.
 V eterinarian Ernie Ward wants 
pet owners to be more concerned about their pets’ weight.  
Today is the fourth annual Nation-
al Pet Obesity Awareness Day , created by the Association for Pet Obesity Pre-vention, founded by Ward in 2005.
Ward has been fighting pet obesity 
for almost 20 years. It began when he started noticing all the “fat cats and 
hefty dogs” and brought it to the at-
tention of fellow vets.
“I saw my patients become super -
sized before my eyes,” Ward said. He didn’t want to see the issue ignored.
Thousands of vet offices across the 
nation will be recording weight data on patients and submitting it to Ward so he and his team can give statistics.
Last year’s statistics estimated that 
51.5 percent, or 89 million, of dogs and cats are overweight.
When Ward goes to his two daugh-
ters’ soccer games and sees a mom on the opposing team handing the kids Mountain Dew at halftime, he sees a link between the two epidemics. 
Ward said he considers childhood 
obesity and pet obesity as one in the same. He said that parents need to feed their children and pets “real food” and not “high school chemistry experiments.”
“Anything you can think of with 
a child’s day care, it’s that for dog’s,” said Rachel Thornton, day care man-ager and owner of Dog Wood Park in Gainesville.
Rosie, a 12-year-old white bas-
set hound, droops around the day care with a heavy underside and a pink-bowed collar.  Brandy, a 9-year-old golden retriever, tends to rest in the shade but “plays referee” for the younger dogs. She said it’s difficult to help dogs lose weight because they are older, but they participate in exer -
cise during their 12 hours in daycare. 
She said that dieting helps in the 
long term but that the trick behind weight loss is to know the types of treats you’re giving your dog.  
“Peanut butter balls: not a smart 
choice for a chunky dog,” she said.
Ward doesn’t admonish “people 
food” or snacks — it’s the kind of snacking and ingredients in foods that can be detrimental to a healthy diet.
Faustino Ribeiro, of Gainesville, 
said his dog’s weight varies in part on whether he or his wife feeds him.
“I’m weak, and he knows really 
well how to beg,” Ribeiro said.
Lucky , Ribeiro’s 3-year-old Jack 
Russell terrier, enjoys meals ranging from vegetables to pizza.
Ward’s awareness day is for all 
animals, but studies tend to cover common pets: cats and dogs. Ward is researching horses and “pocket pets” like hamsters and rabbits, but it’s dif-ficult to even help cats. 
“Cats don’t jog,” he said. Vet offers advice to 
slim chunky pets

KABUL, Afghanistan — Re-
leasing Taliban figures detained 
at Guantanamo Bay and scratch-ing scores of others off the U.N. sanctions list would jump-start peace talks aimed at ending the 9-year-old war, members of Af-ghanistan’s new peace council said Tuesday.
The council members, who 
hold their first business meet-ing Wednesday, said goodwill gestures from the U.S. and inter -
national community could spur reconciliation talks — perhaps at a neutral location in Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, Egypt or Turkey.
The momentum for a political 
solution has been slowly build-ing in Afghanistan as public sup-port for the war has waned in the West. The renewed push for peace comes as the last of 30,000 U.S. reinforcements have arrived in Afghanistan, pushing deeper into areas long held by insur -gents.
Many top military and diplo-
matic leaders have publicly sup-ported peace efforts, though they remain skeptical that insurgents 
are ready to lay down their arms, 
embrace the Afghan constitution 
and sever ties with al-Qaida and other terrorist networks.
Ethnic minorities and women, 
who were repressed under the Taliban, have expressed con-cerns about what any deal with the militants would bring. Most 
members of the Taliban are Pashtuns, the largest 
ethnic group in Afghanistan. The minority Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras are not likely to sit qui-etly on the sidelines if Karzai, a Pashtun, makes a deal with in-surgents.
But Staffan de Mistura, the top 
U.N. envoy in Afghanistan, said all parties including the Taliban know there is no military solu-tion to the conflict.“I saw my patients become 
super-sized before my eyes.”

The Double Down now 
has buns.
In a marketing move 
some are calling greasy, un-healthy and hideous, not 
much unlike the criticisms 
of its artery-clogging sand-wich laden with 32 grams of fat, KFC is paying (suppos-edly) good-looking girls at a handful of colleges across the nation to promote its death-defying sandwich with the words “Double Down” on the 
buns of specially-designed 
sweatpants. 
Funny? Yeah, a little bit. In 
poor taste? Yeah, a little bit. 
According to reports, 
the girls who hand out KFC coupons while wearing the some-would-say-sexually-demeaning sweatpants are 
called “ambassadors” and 
are paid a few Benjamins to be objectified by the interna-tional chicken-slaughtering giant. 
We realize things could be 
much worse — KFC could tattoo its ambassadors asses with “Finger Lickin’ Good.” And while we realize KFC has as much right to promote its company as the laminated promotions that litter Turling-
ton do, the problem lies with 
the number of women actu-ally competing to label their bodies as nothing more than pieces of meat.

White House shouldn’t 
have lifted moratorium
When weighing a quasi-important, ecologically destruc-tive decision in the aftermath of the nation’s largest environmental catastrophe, apparently six months is 
plenty . 
Six months is plenty of time to forget the images of oil-ooz-
ing birds, petroleum-laden pelicans and scientific reports that say the long-term effects of the Deepwater Horizon’s calamity will not be known for quite some time. 
Less than six months was all it took for the White House 
on Tuesday to lift the moratorium on oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. 
How soon we forget. The Obama administration said the lift came after heavy 
pressure from the oil industry and others, saying they were los-
ing precious time and resources while the government sat idly, 
trying to do unimportant things like save our world from an-thropogenic annihilation. 
And we get it. We get people are all riled up and cranky over 
losing their jobs when Mother Earth bleeds black gold into our formerly habitable waters. 
But going back to business as usual teaches us nothing. It 
teaches us nothing but destroying our world and avariciously exhausting our resources is right and just. 
We know people need jobs. But the answer does not lie in oil. 
The answer lies in redistributing these jobs in expanding renew-able energy similar to what happened when we transformed the transportation industry when we moved from buggy to car. People didn’t lose their jobs; they learned new ones. 
It’s time to adapt, America. Because what’s the phrase? Oh, 
yeah: Adapt or die.
Columnist: Dylan is a man of the ages
Last week, I mused on why Florida needs to get on 
the ball when it comes to decriminalizing marijua-na, and I attended the Bob Dylan concert with thou-
sands of other fans at the Stephen C. O’Connell Center. Some would like to use that anecdotal evidence to further their claims of me as a “stoner.” 
I’d like to rebut that claim. I was intoxicated by the aura 
Dylan brings with him and nothing else.
The Alligator’s been pretty good about covering the liv-
ing legend’s trek to UF and other state universities, includ-ing the University of Central Florida, University of South 
Florida, Nova Southeastern and Florida State University. 
But I want to take the position of a starstruck freshman 
whose foot couldn’t stop tapping and head couldn’t stop shaking.
Frankly, I couldn’t find a reason to miss the show. Bob 
Dylan was an influence on so many of today’s artists, and 
his stories permeate modern music. The man’s not had a 
hit single since 1979 in the U.S., but he’s still a household name. Perhaps it was the “Tangled Up in Blue” appear -
ance in Rock Band 2 that kept his perpetual fame alive with a new generation.
I went to the show alone, not knowing what to expect. 
My seat was next to an older couple  who were probably in their 50s or early 60s and two college students. The older couple seemed subdued, almost like they were obligated to attend, while the collegiate couple stumbled in a bit late but couldn’t contain their excitement. 
I texted a few friends in the audience. Most were just 
as nervously excited as I was in the 30 minutes before Dy-lan came onstage. There was no opening act, which just served to heighten our nervous energy.
Finally, the man himself arrived with his band and be-
gan to play “Rainy Day Women #12 and 35” — the best possible opener in my mind. 
The musicianship and instru-
mentation were top-notch, but Dy-lan’s vocals were a bit shaky. My mind ran amok for a second — is this really Bob Dylan? I rationalized immediately — the man’s 69 and a living legend. I found out the next day from some more-experienced 
Dylan fans he sounded much worse 10 years ago, so my temporary dread turned into confident satisfaction.
And from a man who one can say has defined music’s 
past and future, it wasn’t half bad. 
The show continued on from there, dragging at certain 
points perhaps due to my ignorance of some of Dylan’s newer work, and I was pleased to hear “Tangled Up in 
Blue” but wasn’t incredibly satisfied with Dylan’s inter -
pretation of it versus his live performances earlier in his 
career that YouTube (something no one in Dylan’s height of fame could have imagined) so graciously allowed me to see.
The show picked up with “Highway 61 Revisited,” the 
title song from Dylan’s 1965 (45 years ago!) album. The audience got into it, and you knew you were rocking to Bob freakin’ Dylan, who was described in his introduction as the “poet laureate” of rock ‘n’ roll.
My inner student wanted to leave early to beat the rush 
out, but I just couldn’t do it.
Dylan was too powerful, and the encore encapsulated 
vintage Bob Dylan.
I needed to see Bob Dylan before he died. I couldn’t be 
more glad I did.

Americans entirely apathetic
UF’s Student Body really has nothing in-
teresting to say.
The Society of Professional Journalists 
held a First Amendment Podium event 
Monday on the North Lawn with a lectern 
next to a table covered with books, poems, 
song lyrics and jokes. 
Students could choose from any of the 
readings on the table or they could say any-thing else. Seventy-two empty chairs stood before the lectern.
The point of the event was for students 
to be able to walk up to the lectern and say whatever they wanted, whether it be loud, 
repetitive four-letter words or passages from 
“The Catcher and the Rye.”
 We wanted to grab everyone’s atten-
tion, to have people shouting out their crazy ideas. It was supposed to be so dramatic that anyone passing by on the sidewalk wouldn’t be able to turn away.
SPJ members walked by the Colonnade 
with signs promoting the event. We screamed 
at passers-by, “Use your First Amendment 
rights!” and, “Say anything you want!” 
Hundreds of students walked by the 
event.
Only three people came up to the lectern 
to speak during those two hours.
When I asked each person why they did 
not want to walk up to the lectern to speak, their reasons ranged from being too scared to not caring or to having nothing to say at all. 
This is frightening. Students were given the power and op-
portunity to say whatever they wanted. This is not a right to be taken for granted. Yet so many choose to not take advantage of what 
they are offered.
We are tomorrow’s leaders. To be part of 
such a silent generation is disappointing.
The SPJ event really does apply to the 
way people act in life. Many choose to keep 
their mouth shut because it is enough for them to just live their lives following their everyday, mundane tasks.
We fear change. Using your right to free-
dom of speech can be a risk. 
When you open your mouth and say 
something with meaning, something you care about, people listen. 
And sometimes they will not be happy 
with what they hear. 
People get uncomfortable when they hear 
about the faults of society. It’s just easier to 
pretend everything is perfect.
In a generation in which the latest tech-
nology and popular culture is what matters, 
the importance of the First Amendment gets 
lost somewhere. 
Maybe we really do have nothing inter -
esting to say. 
Ashley Hemmy
Society of Professional Journalists presidentThe best advice reader has gotten
My father is a man of few words. 
He is not one to raise his voice, lose his 
temper or scold anyone unnecessarily . He is firm but fair and honest to a fault. He is not authoritarian when giving his opinion; rather, 
he makes recommendations in such a way the 
recipient usually feels glad he has done so.
I can only remember my father giving me 
direct advice once. If there were other times, this was the one that resonated with me the most. I was 18, freshly graduated from high school, staring down the barrel of my first day as a wide-eyed freshman at UF.  
We were in my parents’ bedroom, watch-
ing the news together. From the foot of the bed, I was spouting off worries about my im-minent academic adventure. What if I don’t get along with my roommate? What if I don’t make friends? What if I enroll in too many difficult classes and fail them all and lose my scholarship and have to come home and go to community college? 
My father, taking it all in from his green 
TV-watching chair, turned his attention away from Brian Williams and focused on me.  My father is a man of few words. He used just six 
to end my slightly hysterical game of what-if. 
“Be yourself,” he said, “and don’t screw 
up.” 
And there it was: simple in form, but full 
of wisdom. 
Two and a half years later, I can’t find a piece of advice that doesn’t fit under those 
umbrella-shaped commands, and they’re still the best I’ve received.
How did I test their validity? By screwing 
up and trying to undermine my own nature, of course.   
There are minor, forgivable ways to vio-
late these commands, the kinds of tiny sins that make you kick yourself for giving in but not hard enough you quit doing it: failing an exam because you blew off studying, running up the credit card bill a little too high on stuff you don’t need, feigning interest in things you’re not interested in to get someone to like you. 
But those are the type of mistakes that help 
us learn humility and gain experience. What I’ve found to be more important than avoid-ing mistakes is holding onto that advice, es-pecially the first part, and being able to use it when it matters.
Life sometimes leads us to situations 
where it seems easier not to be who we are, or to ignore better judgment, even though we 
know it’s wrong.
 My father taught me to approach those 
situations with pragmatism and morality , to 
know who I am and what I’m made of. The 
rest will come naturally.
Be yourself and don’t screw up, he said. 
Everything else will follow.

WASILLA, Alaska — Ever miss 
your childhood days riding around in 
a red wagon?
A Wasilla, Alaska, couple has the an-
swer: A full-sized pickup that has been 
converted into a giant red Radio Flyer.
Fred Keller and Judy Foster worked 
on the vehicle for 11 months, using the 
base of a 1976 Mazda B1600 pickup truck.
The couple got the idea for their to-
scale replica of the beloved childhood wagon after visiting a car show in sum-mer 2009 in Oregon, and seeing another 
Radio Flyer, albeit that one on a hot 
rod.
“We said, ‘We could use the Mazda 
for that,’” Foster, 67, said of the pickup which had sat undriven for about five years at their home. “We came home from our Portland trip, and about a day 
after, he was tearing the Mazda apart. 
No changing my mind.”
Keller, a 68-year-old retired tele-
phone worker, had all the expertise in composite construction he needed to convert the pickup. His hobby is build-ing home aircraft, and this wasn’t too different.
“The basic structure of the wagon is 
marine plywood, foam, fiberglass cloth and epoxy resin,” he said. “It’s a very strong structure.”
Many components of the Mazda are 
still in the flyer: instrument panel, steer -
ing column, levels, frame and engine.
Keller completed the frame, added smaller wheels, hubcaps painted white and used old laundry detergent caps 
for the hubs.
He also constructed the 8-foot tall 
handle from PVC piping wrapped in 
fiberglass, which rises from the front bumper high over the windshield.
The steering wheel is also an hom-
age to all things wagons, a wheel that could be used on a wagon or cart. There’s no storage space on the wagon, 
so Fred made an especially wide and 
deep glove compartment.
The wagon was completed in Au-
gust after making a few adjustments required by the state motor vehicles de-partment (windshield, mudflaps, more lights) to make it street legal.
Since then, it’s been an instant hit 
whether they’re driving 
around Wasilla or tak-
ing the 50-mile trip to Anchorage.
“They wave at us, they honk at us, 
they give us a ‘Hi’ sign, a thumbs up. They congregate around us when we park,” she said.
Sometimes people follow them for 
blocks, waiting for them to pull over to 
get a closer look.
Both Foster and Keller had Radio 
Flyer wagons growing up — she in 
Kansas, he in Kentucky. 
For them, the childhood memories 
came flooding back in the monthslong conversion project.
Keller says he and his four siblings 
used to pull each other in their wagon, 
and he’d sometimes even hook it up to 
a “lawn mower and things of that na-ture to get some extra fun,” he said.
And now, when people see their gi-
ant wagon rolling down the street, it brings back their own childhood mem-ories.
“It’s just really happy memories, it 
seems like,” Foster said.
Keller jokes the wagon has another 
benefit.
When driving one day, he pulled up 
to two women from his neighborhood 
to say hello.
“One of them looked down and says, 
‘Now THAT is a chick magnet there.’ 
So, made my day, you know,” he said.
They didn’t seek permission from 
the Chicago-based Radio Flyer to use the logo on the side of the extra large wagon.
“We thought we’d just go ahead and 
try it,” Keller said. “We’re not out to do anything for them, or against them or anything like that. We like their prod-uct, and we just hope it maybe pro-motes their product,” he said.
A message left after hours Monday 
evening with Radio Flyer wasn’t imme-diately returned.
Keller said the Radio Flyer is “a very 
solid ride.” They added racing seats to hold them in a little better.
“It holds the road really well on 
country roads, so you kind of get the sensation of driving a sports car.”
One possible drawback for the Ra-
dio Flyer, especially in Alaska, is that it’s a convertible.
He considered building a temporary 
top on it for winter use but eventually decided against it.THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
SANTA CRUZ, Calif. — Mexico’s drug 
traffickers are likely to lose customers in America’s largest pot consuming state if Cal-ifornia legalizes marijuana, but they won’t lose much money overall because Califor -
nia’s residents already prefer to grow their own, according to a study released Tuesday.
That means the proposal on the state’s 
November ballot to legalize marijuana also will do little to quell the drug gangs’ violent and sophisticated organizations that gener -
ate billions of dollars a year, according to the study by the nonpartisan RAND Drug Policy Research Center.Californians, who make up one-seventh 
of the U.S. marijuana market, already are farming marijuana at a much higher rate than in neighboring states and tend to buy domestic rather than smuggled marijuana, the study found.
Tuesday was harvest day on a medi-
cal marijuana farm in Northern California, where dozens of volunteers cut, trimmed and processed hundreds of shopping bags full of freshly snipped buds.
“We’re already growing our own in Cali-
fornia, and what happens in California so goeth the nation,” said Valerie Corral, who helped found and runs a Santa Cruz medical 
marijuana collective. “Legalizing marijuana might undercut Mexican marijuana sales, 
but it isn’t about to derail the cartels. It will just shift their focus.”
California voters will decide next month 
whether to legalize and tax their own rec-reational use of marijuana. The measure is 
closely watched in Mexico, where more than 
28,000 people have died in drug violence since Mexico’s President Felipe Calderon launched his crackdown on organized crime in late 2006. Both Calderon and President Barack Obama agree the vast profits cartels collect in the U.S. — estimated by federal au-thorities between $18 billion and $35 billion a year — fuel drug wars south of the border.
RAND found that less than $2 billion 
of those profits come from marijuana and that losing the California marijuana market would cost cartels about $180 million — or 3 percent — of all the money they make ex-porting drugs to the U.S.
Mexican President Felipe Calderon said 
the California proposition is of critical im-portance.
“We are watching very closely, very 
closely, to what will happen in November. We are not certain what impact it will have on Mexico,” he told The Associated Press in an interview last week.
Making even a slight dent in cartel profits 
makes legalization worth doing, said Drug Policy Alliance spokesman Stephen Gutwil-lig, who supports the Prop. 19 California bal-
lot proposal.
“The bottom line is that creating any law-
ful, legitimate market for sales of marijuana 
to adults isn’t good for the criminal syndi-cates that currently control this gigantic un-derground economy,” Gutwillig said.
Proponents of the proposition say they 
want to lower prison costs and find new revenue from marijuana taxes, and that the 
measure could reduce violence associated 
with the illegal drug trade in California and Mexico.
The Obama administration disagrees, and 
U.S. drug czar Gil Kerlikowske told the AP that the new study backs them up.
“This report shows that despite the mil-
lions spent on marketing the idea, legalized marijuana won’t reduce the revenue or vio-lence generated by Mexican drug trafficking organizations,” said Kerlikowske, head of the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Pol-icy. “The bottom line is that increased access 
and availability to marijuana jeopardizes the 
health and safety of our citizens.”
Some former law enforcement officials, 
however, said it’s hard to imagine there wouldn’t be major cartel profits at stake.
“It’s ridiculous to claim that ending pro-
hibition won’t have a big financial impact on these violent criminals’ bottom lines,” said Stephen Downing, a supporter of Prop. 19 
and a former Los Angeles Police Department 
deputy chief of police.
But the RAND study concludes the only 
way to cut into the cartels’ profits would be the unlikely scenario of legal marijuana growers taking over cartel distribution else-where in the U.S. Under that scenario, Mexi-can drug trafficking organizations, currently providing at least half the marijuana in the 
U.S., would lose roughly 20 percent of their 
total drug export revenues. 
Their remaining profits from more lucra-
tive drugs like cocaine and heroin would continue to flow.
“If that happens, then legalization could 
reduce some of the Mexican drug violence in the long run,” said Beau Kilmer, the study’s lead author and co-director of the RAND 
Drug Policy Research Center.
But the study authors said they don’t be-
lieve the federal government will stand idly 
by if home-grown smugglers were to capture the entire national market now held by Mexi-co-sourced marijuana.8, ALLIGATOR � WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 13, 2010

NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
ORLANDO — Dwight Howard 
had heard it all before, people offer -
ing constructive criticism and invi-
tations to improve his game — he never really seriously listened.
Until he received a phone call 
from Hakeem Olajuwon.
That tends to happen when 
the voice on the other end of the phone is the NBA’s former domi-nant center, shot-blocking king and two-time champion. Olajuwon just 
couldn’t continue to watch help-
lessly from home as Howard tried to muscle the Orlando Magic past the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals with the same 
mundane moves.
Superman needed help.
So The Dream gave him a reality 
check.
“I got a chance to analyze his be-
havior,” Olajuwon said. “You see 
the athletic ability and power, but 
you don’t see a lot of creativity of-fensively. He just can’t be afraid to 
open up his game.”
Olajuwon’s call, which came 
when the Magic were down 3-0 to the Celtics in last season’s series, 
pushed Howard to almost single-handedly force the series to six 
games. Howard shed his happy-
go-lucky attitude and became a one-man wrecking crew, giving a 
glimpse of all that untapped offen-
sive potential so many have craved from the NBA’s twice-reigning de-
fensive player of the year.
There just wasn’t enough to 
show.
Olajuwon, given Howard’s 
phone number after meeting his 
mother at a Magic game in Texas, 
met with Howard in Houston im-
mediately after the series. The pair trained for five days during the 
NBA finals.
They worked for three hours a 
day, drilled on post moves, face-up jumpers, baby hooks, pump fakes 
and even some of those famous “Dream” shakes. Olajuwon also 
stressed the need for Howard to be 
mentally stronger, tone down his playfulness and maintain focus.
“He just needs to take advan-tage of his speed and quickness,” said Olajuwon, who helped Lakers star Kobe Bryant a year ago. “He 
doesn’t always need to power his 
way through people.”
Players and pundits have 
weighed in constantly on the need for Howard to improve.
Retired scoring leader Kareem 
Abdul-Jabbar called Howard’s game “kind of predictable” before the Magic lost to the Lakers in the 
NBA finals two seasons ago. Sha-
quille O’Neal’s has repeatedly taken verbal jabs at Howard, and 
now LeBron James moved into the 
neighborhood this summer with the Miami Heat.
Consider all that and it’s no 
wonder Howard reworked his rep-ertoire.
Already this preseason he has 
displayed bank shots, fadeaway jumpers, faced up opponents 
and dribbled around them — not 
through them — with mixed suc-cess. He spends extra time after 
practices — and comes in at night 
— to work on his mid-range shots and free throws.
And that might not even be the 
most noticeable difference.
The constant jokes and overall 
silliness Howard used to display have vanished publicly. 
“There’s no question he’s 
changed,” Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said. “He hasn’t broken from that (serious attitude) for one 
minute. “He’ll talk a little in stretch-
ing, which is fine. But when we’re working, he hasn’t broken once 
where he’s goofing around.”Howard trains with Olajuwon to improve offensive game

� OBAMA WILL ROOT FOR THE HEAT 
UNLESS THEY PLAY THE BULLS.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
MIAMI — When Heat forward Chris 
Bosh met President Barack Obama this week, no introductions were necessary. To 
Bosh’s surprise, Obama knew exactly who he was.
Bosh and Dwyane Wade were among 
those attending a fundraiser at former Heat player Alonzo Mourning’s home on Monday, when Obama appeared in sup-port of U.S. Rep. Ron Klein’s re-election campaign. 
It was the first time Bosh met 
the president, who says he will 
root for the Heat this season — 
except when they play the Chi-cago Bulls.
Bosh says “it was cool” talk-
ing to the president and he doesn’t get nervous meeting other celebrities because “we’re all people at the end of the day.”
Bosh says Obama talked about team-
work, drawing parallels between what Wade wanted to see during this summer’s free-agent period and what the president wants to see in the November elections out of the Democrats. Heat’s Bosh, Wade meet Obama at local fundraiser

alligatorSports Podcast SCOREBOARD TEEING OFF WITH MIKE McCALLMatt Tripp / Alligator Staff
UF wide receiver Chris Rainey has not been a part of the team since being arrested on 
Sept. 14. He has recorded six catches for 34 yards and a touchdown in two games.
By MIKE McCALL
Alligator Staff Writer
mmccall@alligator.org
 
When Emmanuel Moody walked 
through the Florida football offices Sunday, 
he came upon a welcome sight waiting in 
the hallway.
Without any team announcement, sus-
pended slot receiver Chris Rainey was back with the Gators.
“He just popped up at Sunday meet-
ings,” Moody said. “The first time I saw him, he was just sitting with his arms crossed in the hallway, looking up at me and smiling, saying, ‘I’m back man.’ I gave him a hug. 
It’s really good to have Chris back.”
But Rainey — suspended since a Sept. 
14 arrest on felony stalking charges — isn’t 
fully back. He practiced Sunday but still has a few hurdles to clear before he gets back on the playing field.
In a statement released Tuesday, UF 
coach Urban Meyer said Rainey won’t par -
ticipate this weekend against Mississippi State.
“Chris Rainey is working toward being 
part of our football team again,” Meyer said. “I’m disappointed that he violated a core value of our program, but he contin-ues to pay a price for his actions. Chris will have to meet a set of conditions to become a part of our team again, and although he is practicing, he will not play this weekend.  
The timetable for his return will depend on his ability to follow the guidelines we have laid out for him.”
Rainey’s legal troubles arose from a late-
night spat with an ex-girlfriend, which cul-minated in him sending her a text message that read, “Time to Die [expletive].”
The victim appeared in court the next 
day, saying she never felt threatened and didn’t want Rainey to be prosecuted.
On Sept. 27, Rainey accepted deferred 
prosecution from the state attorney, reduc-ing the charge to a misdemeanor. It will be dropped altogether if he maintains good behavior and meets public service and fi-nancial obligations.
“I am embarrassed and sorry for my 
actions and I apologize to everyone that I affected by my behavior,” Rainey said in a statement. “I’m working towards being a part of the Florida football program again, and I realize that representing this uni-versity is a privilege. I have spent the last several weeks reflecting on my actions and realized that is not who I want to be.”
In two games before the incident, Rain-
ey had six catches for 34 yards and a touch-
down and added 16 rushing yards on four 
carries. 
Upon his return, he’ll likely be a key 
part of Florida’s struggling offense, which Meyer has said lacks big playmakers.  
Rainey has three runs of longer than 70 yards in his career, and he scored in last year’s Sugar Bowl win against Cincinnati 
by hurdling a defender into 
the end zone from beyond 
the 3-yard line.
“Rainey is a big play wait-
ing to happen,” said receiver Andre Debose, one of several players filling in for Rainey. 
“Just having him on the field is always a threat. They always have to account for No. 3, so it’ll be great for him to come back. We need somebody.”
Rainey’s arrest was another blemish on 
the Gators’ far-from-spotless arrest record under Meyer, but his teammates seem will-ing to forgive.
“If you know Chris personally, you can 
kind of see the whole situation in a differ -
ent light and different perspective,” Moody 
said. “That was his personal life, and I’ve 
known Chris for almost four years now. He 
smiles a lot, he’s a great kid and we love 
having him around the program. He’s not some guy who brings negative energy. He’s not that type of guy, so seeing Chris back, we love him and we’re happy he’s back on the team.”Rainey back at practice, will not play Saturday

When the No. 13 Gators embarked on 
their second Southeastern Conference road 
trip of the season, they were fresh off their best offensive weekend of the year.
Unfortunately for Florida, its offensive 
assertion didn’t follow the Gators on the road to Alabama. Florida managed a tie against the Crimson Tide but lost to Au-burn to cap the road trip.
“It was a rough weekend for sure,” 
coach Becky Burleigh said. “We have high expectations for this team. Certainly get-ting one point out of an SEC weekend isn’t where we want to be.”
The Gators gave up late goals in both 
games, and Auburns’ game-winning score came off a corner kick in the 89th minute. The goal was the second off of a corner 
kick and the fourth with less than five min-utes left.
This was, however, the first time a piv-otal goal resulted in a Florida loss.
“Everyone is aware of the situation, 
maybe in some cases too aware,” Burleigh said. “It’s something that’s been in our head a little bit, but I don’t think it’s a lack 
of effort. It’s a lack of execution.”
The Gators now prepare to play Ten-
nessee and Georgia at home, where they 
remain undefeated. Florida is 2-2-2 in its past three road trips.
“The most important thing is consisten-Gators look to rebound after winless weekend

UF midfielder Erika Tymrak believes that the Gators’ offense is best when it plays one-two touch and makes 
quick passes.
UF looks to get back to 
quick, crisp passing
cy,” midfielder Tahnai Annis 
said. “Being relentless against these teams and getting early 
goals is key in beating these 
teams.”
To stay consistent, the Gators 
know they have to read their 
teammates better.
“For me, connection is key ,” 
midfielder Erika Tymrak said. 
“I usually play with Tahnai (An-nis), McKenzie (Barney), Taylor (Travis), and Lindsay Thompson. 
I make sure that I’m always feed-
ing off their runs. I know I can find them whether it be a through ball or over the top, but as long as we stay connected the goals will come.”
Florida’s identity this season 
has relied on its solid defense turn-
ing into quick offense. The Gators 
have done a good job keeping possession this season. They are in top form when they play timely through balls in space.
“We came to the realization 
that we are at our best when we connect passes and play one-two touch,” Tymrak said. “We told 
ourselves that we just have to 
keep that up. If we play our game, then the goals will come and we will probably be successful.”SOCCER , from page 14

UF Midfielder� HE MISSED HIS FRESHMAN SEA -
SON WITH A HAMSTRING INJURY.
By KYLE MAISTRI
Alligator Staff Writer
kmaistri@alligator.org
 
Andre Debose didn’t need to run routes 
or learn a book’s worth of plays in high 
school. 
The former Sanford Seminole High 
standout said when he wasn’t taking a handoff in the backfield and knifing 
through opposing defenses, he was us-
ing his speed to run straight past them for touchdowns. 
It was an easier time. And something 
Debose thought he would be able to con-
tinue when he came to Florida a year ago. 
But a hamstring injury forced him to 
redshirt, and the move to receiver full time proved more difficult than expected.
Learning the playbook was a new chal-
lenge. 
“I’m starting to figure out that it does 
take more to be a student of the game, in-stead of just going out and doing it,” De-
bose said. 
Unable to get on the field at the begin-
ning of the season, a couple of personnel 
losses —  Chris Rainey and Jeff Demps — 
forced the redshirt freshman to contribute, 
culminating in an 88-yard kickoff return 
for a touchdown against LSU on Satur -
day. 
Debose started his first healthy year at 
UF by moving from the H-receiver posi-
tion (the slot) to the X-position (split out), 
where he was to back up starter Deonte 
Thompson. 
But Rainey’s suspension from the team 
allowed Debose to move back inside to the 
slot, where he rarely has to read defenses on the fly in option routes, the thing he struggled with the most. Debose caught four passes for 36 yards out of the slot in 
the first quarter of the fourth game of the 
season against Kentucky, the first catches 
of his career. 
His improved work ethic earned him 
a few plays, even if he wasn’t ready to be involved in all of the offensive packages 
over the course of an entire game. 
“I’ve never experienced (not playing) 
in my life,” Debose said. “I’ve been play-
ing football since I was 7 and I never sat on the bench, so I had to figure something 
out fast.”
Fast is Debose’s specialty. So special teams coach D.J. Durkin ap-
proached the speedster be-fore the LSU game and told 
Debose he wanted him to 
return kicks. Demps’ lin-
gering foot injury left the 
Gators looking for another 
return man, but Durkin 
wanted Debose to know this could be a 
long-term spot for the burner to make an 
impact. 
Debose responded with that long re-
turn for a touchdown against the Tigers, 
keeping the Gators in the game after fall-ing behind 26-14. 
“We identified an electric playmaker 
tonight,” UF coach Urban Meyer said after the game. “Now we need him to do that more consistent and more often.”
Meyer has expressed concern with the 
offense’s inability to generate big plays, 
and Debose thinks he can help in that de-
partment. 
“I feel that I can bring that element to 
the team,” Debose said. “We have a lot of 
players capable of making big plays, it’s 
just coaches have to put people in certain situations to make those plays.”Debose starting to find 
role in Gators’ offense

Quarterback John Brantley’s tendency to dump passes into the flats has 
been one of the many issues Gators fans have taken with the offense. On Florida’s go-ahead drive in the fourth quarter, when fans strongly voiced their opinions of the team’s play-calling, Brantley’s first-down pass to run -
ning back Emmanuel Moody drew the initial jeers. alligatorSports Tyler

The Gators headed into the Jerry 
Pate Invitational knowing they had 
to go low.
Red numbers littered the score-
cards of Florida’s men’s golfers after 
Monday’s double dose of rounds, and No. 1 UF held a two-stroke lead 
against No. 22 Auburn. But Florida 
shot 6 over par on the back nine of Tuesday’s final round to finish in second place, seven strokes back of 
the Tigers.
“We didn’t play that great on 
the front nine either, to be honest 
with you,” coach Buddy Alexander 
said. “We didn’t play awful, we just 
didn’t make any birdies.”
After combining for 27 birdies 
and two eagles Monday, UF record-ed just 10 birdies during Tuesday’s final round and none shot under par. Florida finished the tournament with 
a 2-over round of 282 for a 4-under 
tournament total of 836.
“It’s not like I realistically felt we 
were going to go undefeated this 
year,” Alexander said. “You got to 
tip your cap to Auburn. They played better than we did today.”Although a second consecutive 
victory eluded his grasp, Tyler Mc-Cumber has much to be excited 
about. 
The sophomore had only three 
bogeys in three rounds and demol-
ished his previous career-low 54-
hole total of 211. McCumber had one 
bogey and one birdie on the day to shoot 70 and finish third individu-ally at 205 (-5). 
“Right now Tyler McCumber is 
our best player,” Alexander said. “I’ve always felt like he had a lot of 
talent and was going to be an out-
standing college player. It was not a matter of if, it was more a matter of when.”
If McCumber has been the best 
thus far, then senior Bank Vongvanij is an extremely close second. Vong-vanij carded a 1-over 71 for a 54-hole total of 208 and finished in a tie for 
fifth individually. The senior’s scor -ing average of 69.2 through two 
tournaments.
Sophomore Phillip Choi is one 
of a handful of young players Alex-ander will rely on this season if he continues the steady play he showed in Birmingham, Ala. Choi, who was named to the Southeastern Confer -
ence All-Freshman team last season, finished ninth individually with a score of 211 (+1) after carding a 3-over 73 Tuesday. 
Making his season debut, Tommy 
Mou completed the tournament in a tie for 13th at 4-over 214. 
Mou made the turn at even and 
then rolled in an eagle on 15, but the 
sophomore scattered two bogeys on 
the back nine en route to an even-par round of 70.
Redshirt senior Andres Echavar -
ria recorded three birdies on the front nine Tuesday to get to 3 un-der but again had trouble down the stretch, making three bogeys and a double bogey on the back to finish 
at 1 over. 
The Colombian-born golfer will 
miss the Gators’ next tournament to 
play in an amateur event.
“That will be tough for us to over -
come,” Alexander said. “He is one of our better players. Someone’s going to have to step up for Andres.”Gators finish tourney in second
�HE IS GEORGIA’S 11TH PLAYER TO 
BE ARRESTED THIS YEAR.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
 
ATHENS, Ga. — Coach Mark Richt 
said Tuesday his two-game suspension of 
tailback Caleb King will make it more dif-ficult for Georgia to build off last week’s win over Tennessee.
King is Georgia’s 11th player to be ar -
rested this year.
Richt announced King’s suspension 
Tuesday following King’s arrest on Mon-day for failure to appear at a court date for a speeding ticket in nearby Walton County.
King, the team’s second-leading rusher, 
will miss Saturday’s game against Van-derbilt and the game against Kentucky on Oct. 23.
Georgia ended a four-game losing streak 
with it’s 41-14 win over Ten-nessee last week.
Richt said King’s arrest 
could hurt efforts to build on the win.
“It’s hard to have great continuity week 
by week if a young man has done some-thing to keep himself from being on the field,” Richt said. “Again, it’s our job also to deal with those things, but also not take 
away from the preparation and not take 
away from the focus of the team. It’s some-thing I’d prefer not to have to manage, but we’ve been managing it.
“This week, I don’t think there is any 
doubt our guys will be focusing on Van-derbilt.” King receives two-game suspension after arrest“You got to tip your cap to Au -
burn. They played better than 
we did today.”
