around in a most unusual vehicle — the Weinermo-bile. Barbara Gilbert won a trip to ride “shotbun” in Oscar Mayer’s eccentric car which resembles a giant hot dog. 
The 67-year-old Rolling Greens resident spent Sat-

UF graduates are getting high 
marks from job recruiters, accord-
ing to a new ranking released by The Wall Street Journal.
UF ranked ninth among recruit-
ers surveyed for the report released Sunday. 
The newspaper surveyed 842 
recruiters from public and private companies, nonprofit organizations and federal agencies across the coun-try for the report.
UF Career Resource Center Di-
rector Wayne Wallace said the uni-versity has become a frequently tar -
geted school for large corporations 
that only recruit at a select number 
of schools.
“UF is a tremendous fishing 
ground for employers,” he said.
The Wall Street Journal report 
cites big student populations and good practical training as reasons why major public university grad-uates are finding success out of 
school. 
Wallace had similar observations 
about UF graduates.
He said the university has a large 
number of graduates and high aca-
demic standards, as well as students who are willing and able to relocate for jobs.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando 
said the university has always held its graduates in high esteem.UF grads

The soft chants of prayers 
toward Mecca marked the start 
and end of “Quran 101” at the Reitz Union Grand Ballroom Monday night.
About 100 people attended 
the event, which was spon-
sored by Islam on Campus to 
educate people about the Quran and give them a chance to ask 
questions about the holy text 
of Islam, said Nora Zaki, vice 
president of external affairs for 
Islam on Campus.
Three University Police De-
partment officers were present as a precaution after last week’s 
uproar about the proposed 
burning of Qurans at the Dove World Outreach Center, but the speech by assistant profes-
sor Sarra Tlili and the questions 
that followed included no men-
tion of Dove or Pastor Terry 
Jones.
Tlili, an expert in Arabic 
language and literature who teaches in the department of 
languages, literatures and cul-tures within the College of Lib-eral Arts and Sciences, filled in 
for Sheik Faraz Rabbani, the 
original keynote speaker. 
Rabbani was held up by 
U.S. Customs and unable to 
fly down from Canada for the 
event, said Khaled Abdelgh-any, the treasurer of Islam on Campus.
In her speech, Tlili explained 
the history of the Quran and described the themes and style of the text, which the angel Ga-briel revealed to the prophet Muhammad over a period of 23 years.
Tlili said the word “Quran” 
literally means “recitation.” She also said that the Quran is meant to be spoken, not read silently. 
Like Judaism and Christian-
ity, Islam emphasizes the unity of God.

Gator Growl will run a little bit differ -
ently this year.
Instead of a musical performance, the 
Oct. 15 show will feature two comedians, 
as well as a show host.
Members of the audience will still get 
their share of Seminole-bashing skits and performances, and this year they will be able to vote on the best one. 
“We’re definitely expecting a good 
group of people this year,” said David 
DeVinney, director of public relations for Gator Growl. 
“We have what we believe is a good 
show planned.”
This year’s headliners will be comedi-
ans Aziz Ansari and Kevin Hart, and Dan 
Levy will host. 
DeVinney said the staff wanted to in-
clude two comedians in the show rather 
than a musical performance because it is something every-one in the audience will enjoy, 
no matter what kind of comedy 
they like.
“Having a multiple-comedian approach 
guarantees the most entertainment for the majority of our audience,” DeVinney said.
The Growl Minute of Fame segment of 
the show, where students and alumni sub-
mit videos to be played during the rally, will be held as a contest this year between students and alumni. 
DeVinney said the groups have until 
Oct. 1 to record their skits, which should be under a minute, and upload them to You-Tube. 
After they have uploaded their videos 
for review, they should e-mail the link as per the instructions on the Gator Growl website.
“Our general guidelines are just to keep 
it in good taste,” DeVinney said.
Once all the clips are submitted, 
DeVinney said Gator Growl staff members will vote on the best three and post them 
to the website where viewers can vote for 
their favorite. Gator Growl cuts music, adds comicSEE QURAN, p AgE 4

Flu shots now free at SHCC
Students looking to prevent 
the flu this season can now re-ceive free flu vaccines available on campus.  
Last fall, students had to pay 
$5 for a flu shot, but due to the high demand for the vaccine, not all students received the shot. The Student Health Care Center ordered about 10,000 flu vaccines this year, when only about 5,000 were ordered last year.
Kelly Mitchell, registered 
nurse at the SHCC, said the flu 
shot this year will include H1N1 
protection. 
“It’s the best remedy to keep-
ing healthy throughout the flu season,” Mitchell said. She also recommends eating right and 
getting enough rest to keep 
healthy. 
While the current flu season is 
unpredictable, Mitchell suggests every student get the flu shot, es-pecially those who have weaker immune systems.
“It’s free and it takes only a 
couple of minutes to be in and 
out of my office,” she said. “So, 
why not get the vaccine?”

� THE STATE AVERAGE IS 1473 ON A 
2400-POINT SCALE.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
MIAMI — Florida high school seniors 
again scored below the national average on the SAT college entrance exam, with the class of 2010 scoring slightly lower than 2009 did.
Test results released Monday show 
Florida students scoring an average of 496 in critical reading, 498 in math and 479 in writing, out of a maximum 800 points in each subject. 
Combined, Florida’s score of 1473 was 
two points lower than the state scored in 2009 and 37 points below the national com-bined average of 1509.
 The state scored below average in every 
category: the national averages were 501 in reading, 516 in math and 492 in writing.
A record 102,741 of students took the 
exam in Florida, about 2,500 more students than 2009.
Some good news for Florida came from 
minority students, who generally scored better than their counterparts nationally.
Among racial and ethnic groups in Flor -
ida, students of Mexican heritage made the largest gains in each subject, jumping 10 points in writing and 9 in reading. 
Black and Hispanic students overall 
achieved higher scores in math and read-ing than their respective racial and ethnic groups nationwide.
It was that news that state Education 
Commissioner Eric Smith focused on. The College Board, which administers the test, said 2010 was Florida’s most diverse group to take the test; 48.5 percent come from minority groups, up from 47 percent last year.“Florida’s teachers and school leaders 
have answered the call for increased stu-dent college and career readiness with a re-sounding voice challenging our students to reach higher and unleash their true poten-tial,” Smith said in a statement. “Because of their efforts, more of our children will graduate from school prepared for the next stage of their life, more will succeed in their careers and more will experience the hap-
piness and prosperity that only a quality educational experience can provide.”
As in other years, persis-
tent trends regarding the relationships be-tween family income and level of parental education held true, with those students coming from the poorest families also re-cording the lowest scores and those from the wealthiest with the highest — a gap of more than 100 points in all three subject areas.“We need to prepare more of our stu-
dents for college level work,” said Alan Richard, spokesman for the Southern Re-gional Education Board. “Our economy now demands it, and if we expect to re-main competitive globally than this is the type of work force we’re going to need to have in the future.”
Richard said the that while important, 
the SAT and other college admission tests are not an overall indicator of a state’s edu-cational progress. 
He said SAT scores have generally 
shifted downward over the last few year, a trend that holds true in much of the South-east United States.
Nationwide, the average SAT score held 
steady — the combined 1509 was the same score the class of 2009 received. That score is nine points lower than the average in 2006, when the writing section was added and the test shifted to a 2400-point scale.
Florida SAT scores stable, below national average

Students had the chance to learn a little 
bit more about getting involved on campus 
Monday afternoon.
About 10 organizations gathered at the 
Reitz Union Colonnade Monday for this se-
mester’s Involvement Carnival, which was 
a part of the Jewish Student Union’s Fall Welcome Week. It was an opportunity for members of the organizations to speak with students about what they do and why stu-
dents should get involved. 
According to Chelsea Cohen, president 
of the JSU, the purpose of the event was to 
help students become involved in clubs and organizations that interest them.
“When you come to a school like UF, it’s 
easy to get lost in the crowd,” Cohen said, “But by getting involved in a student or -
ganization, you can meet new people with 
the same interests and passions as you, as 
well as be exposed to social networking and unique opportunities that you ordinarily wouldn’t be aware of.”
She said JSU tries to appeal to the Student 
Body as a whole, not just Jewish students. “We work to throw away stereotypes, 
which is something I personally think is im-portant, especially on a campus as diverse as UF,” Cohen said. 
Mitchell Ortega, a political science major 
and senior member of College Democrats, enjoyed promoting events and involvement for his organization at the carnival. 
“College Democrats take great pride in 
being accessible to students to answer their 
questions,” Ortega said. “There’s no better 
way to facilitate that than tabling at events like this one.”Campus organizations host Involvement Carnival
� HE SAID THOSE VISITING 
FROM THE US WERE TREATED INHUMANELY.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s foreign 
minister apologized for the suf-
fering of a group of former World 
War II prisoners of war visiting from the United States and said they were treated inhumanely.
The six POWs, their relatives 
and the daughters of two men who died are the first group of U.S. POWs to visit Japan with government sponsorship, though 
groups from other countries have 
been invited previously.
“I offer my deep, heartfelt apol-
ogy for the inhuman treatment 
you suffered,” Foreign Minister Katsuya Okada told the group Monday.
The POW group’s leader, 
90-year-old Lester Tenney, who survived the Bataan Death March in 1942, said he welcomed the government’s apology but still seeks recognition from the pri-vate companies that “used and abused” prisoners in their mines and factories, often under brutal conditions.
“At no time have we gotten 
from these private companies just a letter,” Tenney said. “These pri-vate companies have kept quiet for 65 years. It is an insult, be-cause by their keeping quiet they are hoping we will die off.”Japan surrendered in 1945 after 
the atomic bombings of Hiroshi-ma and Nagasaki. Japanese lead-ers have apologized for the coun-try’s militarist past many times, but the government contends that all reparations issues were settled by treaties after the war.
Japanese courts have also ruled 
that reparations issues must be dealt with on a country-to-country basis, but cases challenging that are pending in several courts.
After a short time in Tokyo, 
each POW will travel to a city of his choice. Some will visit the fac-tories, docks or mines where they worked.
Tenney was involved for de-
cades in trying to arrange the visit and has lobbied for redress from 
the companies that used POWs after their capture. The compa-nies have had no comment on the visit.
Tenney was taken prisoner in 
1942 by the Japanese military and forced along with 78,000 prison-ers of war — 12,000 Americans and 66,000 Filipinos — to walk from the Bataan peninsula on the Philippine island of Luzon to a prison camp. 
As many as 11,000 died during 
what became known as the Bataan Death March.
He was then brought to Japan 
and forced to work for Mitsui Mining Co. — now Nippon Coke and Engineering Co.Japan foreign minister

Recruiters: Finance majors impressiveequality,” Tlili said. “All people 
are created equal. In fact, all cre-ation is created equal, and if you want to become better, it is some-thing that you need to earn.”
This message of unity was es-
pecially relevant after a weekend in which residents of Gainesville gathered together to remember the victims of Sept. 11 and show their support for Gainesville’s Muslim community.
Jordan Belser, a senior English 
major, said she feels Christians and Muslims have a hard time understanding each other, but she wants that to change.
“While I may not agree with 
everything they believe, it’s not my job to condemn them,” Belser said. 
“It’s my job to love them.” 
“We’ve always believed our students come out 
prepared for the workplace and the world in gener -
al,” he said.
The ranking makes note of the programs recruit-
ers especially touted. For UF, recruiters gave finance 
majors especially high praise.
The acclaim came as no surprise to Michael Ryn-
gaert, chairman of the Department of Finance, In-surance and Real Estate in the Warrington School of Business.“It speaks to the quality of students that we at-
tract,” he said.
He said in addition to simply being impressive 
candidates for employment, well-prepared graduates 
have gone on to establish footholds in major firms like Merrill Lynch, Wachovia and Raymond James.

STUDENT LIFE� HE USED A NEARBY STRIP CLUB AS AN EXAMPLE.
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
NEW YORK — It is two blocks from ground zero, but the 
site of a proposed mosque and Islamic center shouldn’t be seen 
as “hallowed ground” in a neighborhood that also contains a strip club and a betting parlor, the cleric leading the effort said Monday.
Making an ardent case for the compatibility of Islam and 
American values, Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf reiterated that he is searching for a solution to the furor the project has created. But he left unanswered exactly what he had in mind.
If anything, Rauf only deepened the questions around the 
project’s future, telling an audience at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank that he was “exploring all options” — but declining to specify them — while also arguing that a high-profile site is necessary to get across his message of moderate 
Islam.
While opponents of the project see it as insulting the memo-ries of the thousands killed by Muslim extremists in the 2001 
terrorist attacks, Rauf said he doesn’t see the spot as sacred me-morial space.
“It’s absolutely disingenuous, as many have said, that that 
block is hallowed ground,” Rauf said, noting the nearby exotic 
dance and betting businesses. “So let’s clarify that mispercep-
tion.”
Some Sept. 11 victims’ families and others view the pro-
posed mosque site — in a building damaged by debris from the attacks — as very much part of the terrain of death and sorrow surrounding the trade center.
“I just think he’s being very insensitive to say it’s not hal-
lowed ground because of who’s occupying the buildings,” said 
Jim Riches, a former New York City deputy fire chief whose 
son, Jimmy, was killed at the trade center. “The strip club didn’t murder my son.”
The project has become a flashpoint for worldwide debate 
about Islam’s place in America nine years after the Sept. 11 at-tacks. The controversy has colored the fall campaign season and cast a shadow on this past weekend’s commemoration of the attacks, with supporters and opponents of the mosque proj-ect holding rallies nearby.
Rauf said a project meant to foster understanding has be-
come unduly mired in conflict and what he described as misconceptions of a fundamental clash between Islamic and 
American values. The Kuwait-born Rauf said his own faith 
had been shaped by the sense of choosing one’s identity that American society provided, compared with the Muslim milieu from which he emigrated in 1965.
“I’m a devout Muslim ... and I’m also a proud American 
citizen,” said Rauf, noting that he was naturalized in 1979 and has a niece serving in the U.S. Army . “I vote in elections. I pay taxes. I pledge allegiance to the flag. And I’m a Giants fan.”
He said the Islamic center’s organizers were surprised and 
saddened by the uproar and might not have pursued it had they known what was coming. But he declined to detail any strategy for quieting the clamor — or say whether that might include moving the project.
“We are exploring all options as we speak right now, and we 
are working through what will be a solution, God willing, that will resolve this crisis,” Rauf said. “Everything is on the table.” Imam says NYC mosque site is not ‘hallowed ground’

The UF Office of Sustainabil-
ity has coordinated with four lo-cal farms to bring a Community 
Supported Agriculture Program 
to campus beginning October. 
The program will allow stu-
dents to eat fresh fruits and veg-etables, as well as support local farmers and the economy , said Anna Prizzia, director of the Of-fice of Sustainability.
Students would pay up front 
to one of the four local farms par -
ticipating in the program, and they will receive a basket of fruit, vegetables, herbs and flowers once a week.
“This is a nice stepping stone 
to having a farmers market on 
campus,” Prizzia said. 
The Family Garden Organic 
Farm, Swallowtail Farm, Kuma-
rie’s Organic Garden and Gra-ham Farms will be participating in the program this year.
“College kids are some of the 
people that get the worst nutri-tion because they don’t have a lot of time to cook and prepare food, and even the food that’s avail-able on campus obviously isn’t the greatest for them,” said Noah Shitama,  co-owner of Swallow-
tail Farm.
The Family Garden Organic 
Farm will begin delivering Oct. 
18, and the other farms will be starting in November. The pro-gram will last through June.
A full-share bundle, which is 
eight to 10 items of produce each week, runs from $500 to $550. A half-share bundle, which is four to six items per week, runs from $250 to $275. Students would pay one time, up-front. The produce provided in the baskets will de-pend on what’s in season.

Picture this: You’re sitting in your house, 
looking out onto your yard, and you notice 
your lawn more closely resembles a jungle.
Or, another example — you’re in your 
kitchen, dishes stacked high, and you don’t 
really know where to begin. 
You’re feeling too lazy to do these house-
hold chores, and you’ve got some loose cash. There’s someone you can call on, but it’s not a lawn maintenance service, and it’s not a maid — it’s a man who’s running for city commis-sioner of Gainesville, Ozzy Angulo. 
Most political candidates raise money 
with fundraisers and speeches, but Angulo, a 30-year-old Democratic candidate running against Susan Bottcher and Rob Zeller, wants to do things differently.
The aspiring commissioner said he wants to perform household chores or other services 
to people in exchange for political donations. 
“It’ll help develop a more intimate rap-
port between the community and myself,” 
he said. “Here’s a guy who wants to be an elected official, but he’s not above cleaning a toilet or coming to help you with your lawn,” he said  about himself. 
Angulo is not just limited to household 
work. He is willing to provide other services in exchange for donations. 
Cooking is one of those, he said, citing 
his seven years of experience in food service as one of his qualifications. He also said he was willing to offer people rides if they need them, or even give ballroom dancing lessons. 
He said a reason he wants to do this is to 
get to know people, but he also wants people to get to know him. 
“That’s been one of my greatest challeng-
es,” Angulo said. “I can’t tell you how many times people have hung up the phone on me 
or shut their doors on me simply because 
they don’t know me.”
He is yet to be taken up on his offer, which 
he has posted on Craigslist, but he’s still ready and willing to provide these services for people. 
“All I really want is the opportunity for 
the people of Gainesville to get to know what I’m about and to know who I am and 
see that I’m the real deal,” 
he said.
Using Craigslist isn’t the 
only quirky thing  about Angulo’s campaign strat-egy. 
He has also blended his political aspira-
tions with aspirations in a different depart-ment — entertainment. 
He recently collaborated with a local hip-hop group, Swaghouse Ent., on shooting a 
music video that surrounded several of the 
city’s issues, including scenes of a Students for a Democratic Society protest against the shooting of Kofi Adu-Brempong.
Angulo is still raising money the regular 
way. He makes the phone calls and he holds the fundraisers normally associated with po-litical campaigns.
The only difference is he holds his fund-
raisers at places like Mars Pub and Laser 
Tag. 
Despite his unconventional approach, An-
gulo is, in essence, a solution-oriented candi-
date. 
“He’s very enthusiastic about tackling 
problems,” said Larry Bruce, the owner of The Laboratory, which Angulo calls his cam-paign headquarters. “He doesn’t mind going into the issues himself. I think that’s one of his stronger points.”

“This is a nice stepping 
stone to having a farm -

Revolutions have to 
start somewhere.
And some crafty 
farmers want this revolu-tion to start where Naked 
Chef Jamie Oliver’s died: in 
the grocery store.
A fierce coalition of near -
ly 50 carrot farmers across the country has amassed an army to get fat kids to eat a la Bugs Bunny. Launch-ing a $25 million campaign, the carrot coalition hopes to 
help fight America’s obesity 
epidemic with an ingenious effort — making carrots look like junk food. 
The very notion of this 
campaign might explain why, according to the childhood obesity organi-zation Coalition of Angry 
Kids, one in three Ameri-
can children is overweight or obese. 
When we’re forced to 
market baby carrots — which some members of the Editorial Board seri-ously eat like candy — like Cheetos and potato chips, therein lies the very prob-lem with our sedentary schoolchildren. 
But then again, the 
critical crusade to create a healthier America has clearly become an issue of utmost importance in our nation of fatties, as first lady Michelle Obama has made it her personal policy of choice with those gar -
dening guns of steel. 
And if it takes packaging 
carrots in Doritos-like bags and issuing Internet video games in which carrots garner more stardom than Lara Croft’s upper half to get our country’s children to eat vegetables instead 
of Cheetos, carrots instead 
of crullers, then let’s do it, America. 
Most importantly, we’re 
glad we’ll see fewer Ameri-cans with orange-stained Cheetos fingers.
Do Ask, Do Tell
Judge’s ruling right for 
America’s armed forces
The military might soon see an overwhelming num-
ber of dirty little secrets come out. 
Late last week, while Gainesville was worrying 
about its own “Fahrenheit 451” episode, a California fed-eral judge ruled (finally) that the United States military’s 
“Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy was unconstitutional.
Saying it violated gay members of the military’s First 
Amendment and due process rights, U.S. District Judge 
Virginia Phillips ignited the fire that gay Americans and allies alike have sought since Bill Clinton’s administration placed a gag order on the gays with guns. 
And at a time when gay members of our military who 
are just as well trained in services necessary to serve their country and who can speak languages just as well as their 
heterosexual counterparts are being fired for coming out 
publicly in an open act of defiance, we’re glad change has come in the form of judicial action.
And we’re disappointed it still hasn’t come in legisla-
tive form. 
A repeal of the controversial, and now apparently un-
constitutional, 17-year-old law has yet to come in the U.S. Senate following Sen. John McCain’s warning of a fili-buster. We’re hopeful the new ruling will jump-start the 
Senate’s actions to end the policy that President Barack 
Obama promised he would put an end to during his ad-ministration.
We’re hopeful the appeal process will not result in a 
reversal of Phillips’ ruling, so the military can stop bicker -
ing about this discriminatory policy and get back to what it does best: spending trillions of our dollars killing people across the globe.
America could benefit from lying robots
I was emboldened by news last week that robotics fi-
nally made the technological leap forward necessary to create the one thing that can conceivably save our 
country from collapsing under the weight of our own self-importance — lying robot politicians.
From this moment forward, America can fashion its 
future with hypocritical androids instead of relying on 
weak humans with their annoying gray areas and ten-
dency toward consensus.
Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley 
have introduced an “electronic skin” that senses touch using confusing things like nanoparticles and complex 
polymers. The details were published in a scientific 
journal last week, but the vital point to take away from this invention is the fact this e-skin can be sewn onto an android for hours of non-lethal handshakes and photo 
ops.
As if heralded by angels, an experiment at Georgia 
Tech completed the necessary ingredients for artificial 
statesmanship with the inception of the first lying ro-bot. This robot liar, according to an article in the London 
Daily Mail, could behave deceptively by laying a false 
trail about its movements.  It can also tailor its trickery of other robots based on how much knowledge it has of the robot it attempts to deceive. 
From this description, it sounds like our robot liar is 
already campaigning for the fall elections.
Think of all the money our country would save if all 
we needed to do was switch off our politicians at night and plug them into a standard wall socket. As it stands, 
it costs more than $5 million a year to feed Nancy Pelo-
si (she can reportedly eat her body weight in arugula within seven minutes of it being placed in her cage) and keep John Boehner slathered in organic Thousand Island dressing nightly to preserve his luminescent 
tan.
Entourages of aides could be 
lopped from the federal payroll in 
an instant if we stood strong and 
elected only lying robots instead of 
actual humans to higher office. 
Reprogramming based on the latest polls would be 
as easy as the push of a button, and the teleprompter could be eliminated entirely.
The advent of bureaucratic androids even bodes well 
for upstart political movements like our Tea Party Pa-triots. 
The Tea Party has thus far struggled with an identity 
crisis, mostly based on the fact it’s a nebulous concoc-tion of nonsensical libertarians and limp Pentecostals. 
Tea Partiers are having a heck of a time finding a leg-
islative agenda that fits their varied needs, and the clos-est they have come to a political plan is an idea to pack 
the Supreme Court with the righteous southern rock-
ers .38 Special and the remaining members of Lynyrd Skynyrd.
With the ability to build precisely the right lying ro-
bot to suit their requirements, Tea Party Patriots could rally behind a candidate who stands for every ideal they hold dear and represents exactly who they want to pilot our country into an uncertain and murky future: Rambo Jesus, wearing a tuxedo T-shirt and a camo hat from 
Bass Pro Shops.

I want to clear up misconceptions that 
were represented about the Inter-Residence Hall Association in Mon-
day’s Alligator.  IRHA  serves as the ma-jor programming arm of UF’s residence 
halls as well as the students’ voice in 
the residence halls. Furthermore, IRHA prides itself on its ability to build great leaders out of its ranks, many of whom go on to achieve great things in the uni-versity and the world. 
IRHA alumni include Cicerones, 
Campus Diplomats, Student Body pres-idents, doctors, lawyers, teachers and 
anything in between. IRHA has been 
able to sustain this reputation through its ability to provide new student lead-ers with the opportunities and resourc-es they need to succeed in life. 
The letter in question mentions 
IRHA’s supposed “unethical” spend-ing of money. I can’t help but refute this. This organization’s spending has 
rarely come under scrutiny because of 
our ability to govern our resources in a fiscally responsible way. IRHA’s bud-gets are governed by no fewer than five documents, and our general body of more than 60 members must pass every amount of money we spend. Twice. The two allocations in question were both evaluated according to these guide-
lines. 
Furthermore, there seems to be some 
confusion as to IRHA spending resi-
dents’ money irresponsibly. Both times mentioned in the article came from a special fund IRHA has that is not fund-ed solely by residents, or even students at all, for that matter. IRHA takes dona-tions from organizations and business-
es we have worked with for years and 
keep it in a special account with Student Government as outlined by its statutes. This fund is used for many purposes, including helping endow scholarships, donations to charity after catastrophic events such as the earthquake in China, unforeseen ex-penses and, yes, 
our IRHA camp-
ing trip. 
This fund is not used liberally and is 
held to the same strict standards of vet-ting to which the rest of our money is held. Regardless, it must be said  abso-lutely none of this money is funded in part or at all by our residents’ rent.
This account was responsible for the 
funding of 30 percent of our camping trip with the other 70 percent coming directly from the members going on said trip. We had the option of paying for all of the trip or having our mem-bers pay more, but the IRHA Executive Board decided neither were good op-tions. We chose not to cover all of the trip because we weren’t sure our funds 
would be able to sustain the costs. In 
addition to this, we did our best to be as inclusive as possible for the camping trip by not asking for more money, as many of our members mentioned they would not be able to afford to go should the price be raised. 
IRHA prides itself in its ability to 
bring together all different kinds of 
people with varying opinions, which is 
why we hold ourselves to such a high standard when spending funds. 
We make sure all resident’s voices 
are heard, should they choose to exer -
cise that right, and then let democracy prevail by each area’s elected represen-tative. 
People enjoy coming to our meetings 
because IRHA provides a great atmo-sphere that isn’t too serious, but where things are still done properly and suit-ably debated when necessary with all opinions welcomed. 
If you would like to join in on the 
process, stop by our meeting Monday at 6:15 pm in the Reitz Union Room 282. 
We hope to see you there!

Speaking OutLetter diminished IRHA reputation
IRHA has come a long way these past 
few years. One would think it would 
be in the IRHA body’s nature to work together to resolve residence life issues and build community. 
This is a representative democracy 
after all. Could there not have been an-other way to resolve this issue other than for this maverick to publicly harangue his allegedly beloved organization? 
Could he have tried to work with 
other IRHA members to professionally rectify this situation? Many voted for him, including me. There was no reason 
to take it this far. I know his letter will 
devastate the reputation of IRHA imme-diately, likely for many years to come. I am immensely saddened that all of the hours  IRHA members spend working on programs strictly for the residents have now been spoiled by the published attitude that we are alleged thieves.
IRHA is filled with individuals who 
care deeply about on-campus residents. Thanks to this selfish and unimagina-tive letter defaming IRHA, hundreds of 
people must struggle even more to fulfill 
a commitment they believe in and work for every single day. 
IRHA does many great things. Almost 
all of it goes unnoticed. It seems only in the rare times like these do you hear peo-ple ask, “Did you hear about IRHA?” 
If this writer truly cared about his res-
idents and his organization, he would be 
working on that instead of going behind 
everyone’s back to diminish his cause.

3JMLetter to the EditorBy JON SILMAN
Alligator Staff Writer
There were roaches in the may-
or’s ofﬁ  ce. 
It was Thursday , 10 a.m., in the 
most famous town in the world. 
Pastor Terry Jones, the local irritant 
with the pro-wrestler mustache, had 
the world by the ear and way too much pride. Craig Lowe, Gaines-ville’s ﬁ  rst openly gay mayor, had a ﬁ  asco on his hands. 
The bug guy , holding a tank of 
chemicals and a spray gun, asked the receptionist where to start.
“I dunno, anywhere. You’re the 
bug man.”
“What kind of roaches are 
they?”
“They’re big, you know, big fat 
ones. And they ﬂ  y.”
The mayor was in his ofﬁ  ce, a 
bright room with huge windows that overlooked the courtyard of City Hall. This summer, before 
“International Burn a Koran Day ,” 
Lowe was the main target of a Jones rampage. “NO HOMO MA YOR,” said the sign on the lawn of Jones’ church.
Jones has long been a nuisance. 
Like those roaches scurrying through the ofﬁ  ce walls, he was creepy but essentially harmless. Lowe would swat at him and con-demn him, but he just wouldn’t die. Now, ever since Jones said he wanted to burn those books, Lowe’s 
life has gotten considerably more 
complicated. The town was literally crawling with crazies, protesters and news crews. He’d been talking to reporters non-stop for the past two days. 
The problem was, the mayor is 
not a fan of bright lights and big crowds. He’s a one-on-one kind of guy . Lowe is warm, attentive. Ask him a question, and he’ll pause and really ponder it. If he answers too quickly he might stutter, as if the thoughts come faster than the words. Being the center of attention 
is part of his job, sure, but public 
speaking makes him nervous. 
No one knew what the week-
end would bring him, except that it would all happen in the biggest spotlight he has ever faced.
“I think we’ve been able to step 
to the challenges so far,” he said. “We’ll get through this weekend, 
and we’ll move on.” 
On Lowe’s desk was a book so 
battered and worn it was almost 
split in two, held together by a thin rubber band. It was a Quran, given to him that week by a man who carried it for 20 years in his back pocket.
That man must have 
felt that Lowe could use it.
  
In the eighth grade, Lowe ran for 
class president. His classmates, in a situation of irony only clear through the lens of time, put up signs around the school that said, “SAY NO TO 
HOMO LOWE.” Needless to say , 
he lost that election. He can laugh about it now. 
In high school, he came out to 
his best friend, who said, “I’d won-dered if that were the case.”
His favorite actor is Jake Gyllen-
haal. He’s been in love a few times, but he’s currently single. And since 
the death of his 20-year-old cat, 
Jackson, he lives alone. He has an unparalleled sense of equality, cul-tivated from years of dealing with his own discrimination. He pulled three terms as a city commissioner and couldn’t help but be affected by the issues of intolerance he faced on a daily basis. 
“Whenever I would hear of 
someone who had been kicked out of their house because they’re gay, or seeing someone in a store be-ing followed around just because they’re black, that bothered me. Or 
hearing someone not get ﬁ  nancial 
aid for school because their par-ents disapprove of being gay and wouldn’t ﬁ  ll out the required paper work. Stories like that really do im-pact me.”
Enter Terry Jones. Lowe has been dealing with peo-
ple like Jones his whole life. Jones, who runs an online furniture busi-ness from his church. Jones, who teaches that Islam is of the devil. 
Jones, whose “NO HOMO MAY-
OR” sign didn’t work: Lowe won the election in a re-count by 42 votes, making history in the process. 
Back then, Lowe called Jones and 
his church “an embarrassment to our community ,” and Jones’ church made a video calling Lowe a fag. For a while there, that looked the 
long and short of it. Lowe, sworn in 
as mayor in May , spent his ﬁ  rst four months in ofﬁ  ce occupied with bud-get troubles. Gainesville passed the 20th anniversary of the Danny Roll-ing murders without incident.
But over at the Dove Outreach 
Center, Jones was scurrying and planning. The anniversary of Sept. 
11 was approaching. Jones tweeted 
that Sept. 11 would be “Internation-al Burn a Koran Day.” He was up-set about the planned ground zero mosque. He had sipped the spot-light; now he wanted the full cup.
The story caught ﬁ  re when CNN 
picked it up. At the end of August, The New York Times reported that 
Jones said the Quran was full of 
lies, though he’d never read it. By early September the protests had started, the ﬁ  rst in Indonesia, then in Afghanistan, where they burned an efﬁ  gy of the pastor while chant-ing “death to America.” Jones got hammered by Anderson Cooper, then called out by the Vatican, then 
by President Barack Obama. Then came a personal phone call from 
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates. 
During all the drama, Lowe 
stayed updated from the same me-
dia that was hanging on Jones’ ev-
ery word.
“It was such a ﬂ  uid situation.  I 
was just ready for anything,” he said.
Jones was getting more than 100 
death threats a day, and his people were carrying loaded guns while they guarded the perimeter of the 
church. Craig Lowe’s nemesis had 
become an international pest.
“At this point, there’s real dan-
ger,” the mayor said, sipping coffee. “His actions are extremely provoca-tive. We live in a volatile world, and we need to rise above the cycle of provocation and potential vio-lence.”
Nothing irked Lowe more than 
bigots and bullies. And now this backyard bully has the attention of the whole world. At Jones’ church, the media were heavy and deep on the lawn.
  
Friday dawned with Terry Jones 
calling in to NBC’s “Today” show. 
Later, he claimed he’d negoti-
ated a deal to relocate the ground zero mosque. No one bought it, 
least of all the people in charge of 
the project. The Quran burning was on, then off, then suspended, all in the same 24 hours. 
By late afternoon Friday , it was 
deﬁ  nitely off.
The town could breathe again, 
and the media had to balance the re-
lief of no longer having to contribute 
to the problem with the reality that one of the biggest news events of the year had lost its legs. There was still  the possibility of those pesky terrorist attacks. So they camped.
Up the road at Trinity United 
Methodist, a sprawling, elegant beast of a church, the local inter-faith community was gathering for peace. The meeting hall was a con-vention of sorts. Because, or maybe in spite of, the latest Jones news, 
quite a few media members found 
their way into the gathering. They looked like sixth-grade dancers, dressed up but confused about how to make a move. They knew the sto-ry was here somewhere. They just had to ﬁ  nd it.
The church ﬂ  oor was divided 
into stations. The middle of the space 
held the bread table, the centerpiece 
of the evening. At the kid’s art table a young girl used magic markers on a white paper and attracted lots of white light attention. 
Lowe walked slow and blended 
in with his black slacks. In a corner, he admired the art gallery . No one noticed the man with the rolled up 
giveaway T-shirt in his hand.
Even though the burning was 
off, he didn’t feel like the town was 
out of the woods yet.
Nothing was certain with Jones, 
he said. 
Would he ask for assistance from 
anyone?
If necessary, he would ask for as-
sistance from the governor.
Was he going to say a few words 
tonight?
Pause. Stutter.Well, I will if I have to, yes. 
Smile.
Humeraa Qamar, head of the 
Gainesville Interfaith Forum, called the room to attention from the po-dium. Dan Johnson, head pastor of 
the church, found Lowe and ush-
ered him the left side of the stage, whispering in his ear. Lowe looked nervous, but nodded. He started to ﬁ  dget. His left hand tightened and released the T-shirt. Qamar called UF President Bernie Machen to the stage. Lowe looked down at his tie and straightened it with his right 
hand. He looked up at Machen and 
then straightened it again. Qamar got back up to the stage, and Lowe took a deep breath.
At times like this he always told 
himself:
It’s gotta be done. Here I go.One step, two steps. He was on 
the stage.
The applause was loud. The 
lights bright.
He clenched the podium with 
both hands.
The applause died down.He was steel now. Centered.Three seconds to go. Two. One. He leaned into it. “This right here is what 
Gainesville is all about.” No stutter.
No pause. No notes.“When someone questions our 
unity and our solidarity , Gainesville truly meets the challenge.”
Of course, he meant Jones. “We are a community that wel-
comes everyone regardless of re-ligion, race, origin, gender, sexual 
orientation or any other factor.”
Pause for applause.
He killed it. The media smelled 
their story.
“That is the image that we will 
project to the rest of the world for years to come. And it’s thanks to you that we have shown the world who Gainesville truly is. Thanks for 
being here ... and let’s keep working 
together for a better tomorrow.”
Applause explosion. Media to 
stage like ﬂ  ies to death. 
In the bright light the mayor just 
stood there, stoic.
  
Later that night, Maria Kuhn-
Brotton was drinking Patron at the upstairs bar of the local gay bar, the University Club. She spotted Lowe, vodka cranberry in hand. She told 
him he was way too good looking 
to be gay.
He smiled and thanked her. She 
couldn’t help noticing how relaxed he looked. 
He said sometimes you’ve just 
got to go with the ﬂ  ow. 
That night in Gainesville, Terry 
Jones was ﬂ  ying to New York for an 
appearance on the “Today” show.
The Gator football team was 
preparing to beat the University of 
South Florida Bulls.
The Gainesville Muslim com-
munity was preparing for a peace gathering on the plaza where the homeless hang out. Protesters were preparing to swarm Jones’ church 
in the morning, outnumbering his 
congregation by 10 to one.  
And Maria Kuhn-Brotton was 
texting her daughter from a gay bar: 
“Omg!!!! I am having shots with 
the mayor of gville at uc!!! How proud r u of mom!!!”
The balance of power was back 
to normal in the mayor’s town.
Tomorrow, he had another 
speech to give. But tonight, as the most stressful week he’s faced so far drew to a close, he celebrated in a place he felt at home.8, ALLIGATOR  TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 2010

After four seasons of passing and 
quarterback runs, the Gators relied 
on their running backs in the sec-
ond half of Saturday’s game and it worked.
With No. 10 Florida struggling of-
fensively for a second straight week, offensive coordinator Steve Addazio made an adjustment at halftime and decided to use his stable of running backs.
Despite just 11 rushing attempts in 
the first two quarters, the Gators ran the ball 26 times in the second half for 209 yards to blow past the Bulls with 
31 second-half points and move one 
step closer to finding their offensive identity.  
“I believe that’s who we are going 
to be,” coach Urban Meyer said. “Is 
that the perfect setup? Maybe it is, I 
don’t know.”
Last season, UF turned to dual-
threat quarterback Tim Tebow when 
it needed to establish a run game as 
he received about 40 percent of the team’s rushing attempts. But the play calling has changed this year with John Brantley, who has just five car -
ries.
Running backs Jeff Demps (19 car -
ries), Emmanuel Moody (19), Mike Gillislee (10) and Mack Brown (3) have combined to account for 75 per -
cent of the team’s rushing attempts this season.
“You look in the trust we have in 
our running backs compared to 2005 
— just the growth in that position,” 
Meyer said. “It’s night and day.”
Pouncey makes adjustment: 
Thanks to an unlikely source of ad-vice, Mike Pouncey improved his 
snapping against USF.
“I moved my hand up on the ball 
and I was doing bet-
ter at it but I told 
my coach that I still 
wasn’t feeling com-fortable,” Pouncey said.
A Florida equip-
ment manager knew the answer to 
his problems. 
He told the senior center to stag-
ger his right foot back in order to be in a stance similar to the one he used last season at guard.
“At first, I said I would try it out 
because everybody had an opinion 
and it just worked for me — I was 
comfortable in my stance,” Pouncey said.
Other than one botched center-
quarterback exchange on the first

 “I was going through the drive-thru 
at McDonald's. As I was leaving the 
guy told me, 'Hey, don't mess up the 
snaps anymore.' I said, 'Don't mess 
up my sandwich anymore.'"

95 yards on kickoff returns against USF. Also, center Mike Pouncey was awarded the SEC Offensive Line Player of the Week. Through two games, three UF players have earned conference honors.� Striker McKenzie Barney earned the SEC Of -

The Gators ran the ball 26 times in the second half of Saturday's game for 209 yards. 75 percent of the team's rushing attempts have come from the running backs.
UF's offensive identity looks to be different this year
Have you ever watched interviews 
with Muhammad Ali in the days before his last fight?
He was still Ali. Still brash. Still driven. 
But all the characteristics that made him the greatest of all time had eroded.
His face looked full, his eyes hollow. He 
moved gingerly. His words were slow and 
measured.
Few things in sports are more depress-
ing than the end of Ali’s career, even watch-
ing it in retrospect. You surely did not need 30 years of hindsight to know he was going to lose to Trevor Berbick. 
Tennessee football is in that same des-
perate, overweight, late-30s phase. 
Players are still wearing Creamsicle jer -
seys. Fans are still packing the 102,000-seat Neyland Stadium. And we all know the band is still playing “Rocky Top.”
But the six-time national champions 
have won just 12 games the past two sea-sons and feature their third coach in as many years.
Florida-Tennes-
see is supposed to be a rivalry , but Gators coach Urban Meyer is 5-0 against the V olunteers, with only one of those 
victories being de-
cided by less than one score.
As one Tennessee writer put it, the 
changes in Knoxville did not appear in big, bold letters. Really, the collapse could hap-pen to any program — even, gulp, Florida.
About eight years ago the Gators were 
in worse shape than the V olunteers. So how exactly did Tennessee implode?

minutes away from their second national championship appearance in four years. The anatomy of a downfall:

With only nine players on the roster, 
none of whom are seniors, UF women's 
tennis coach Roland Thornqvist’s team is young. But it’s certainly not devoid of leadership. 
Thornqvist is counting on junior Jo-
anna Mather to step up following the departures of Marrit Boonstra and An-
astasia Revzina, who exhausted their 
eligibility last year. She put on a terrific performance at the Southeastern Con-ference Coaches Fall Classic in Auburn, Ala.
Mather defeated No. 20 Kristi Boxx 
of Ole Miss (4-6, 6-4, 6-4) on Saturday before beating Tennessee’s Rosalia Alda (6-3, 6-4) on Sunday, finishing the tournament with a 2-1 record.  
Mather was excited to  participate in 
the tournament after she couldn’t play in Intercollegiate Tennis Association Southeast Regional the past two years Mather returns to action

Rainey expected to return from concussion for trip to Tennessee
drive against the Bulls, the snaps were not a 
problem.
Injuries: The Gators hope to be back at full 
strength when they start conference play Satur -
day.
Outside linebacker Brandon Hicks said his 
wrist was “doing good” and that he hopes to get 
his cast removed in a visit to the doctor Mon-
day.
Also, wide receiver Chris Rainey missed the 
second half against USF with a concussion. Mey-er said he expects him to play this week.
On the offensive line, James Wilson left Sat-
urday’s game with a swollen knee. However, he 
should be available to practice this week.
Finally, cornerback Jeremy 
Brown will play against the Vols after missing part of Saturday's game with a strained hamstring.
Hill’s status unknown: Will Hill has missed 
the first two games of the season and his status for Saturday’s game against Tennessee is up in the air, too.
The safety has not seen the field this year be-
cause he hasn’t been "ready to play," according to Meyer.
When asked about Hill’s status Monday, se-
nior Ahmad Black declined comment.
Game time announced: The Southeastern 
Conference announced that the Florida-Ken-tucky game will begin at 7 p.m. on Sept. 25 in The Swamp. FOOTBALL , from page 14Tale of the
TAPEThe shovel pass has been a staple of the Gators’ offense for the past two seasons, but the 
play has been ineffective so far this season. In four attempts, quarterback John Brantley’s shovel passes have gained a combined seven yards. But coach Urban Meyer insists the team will continue to run it, and run it effectively. Florida’s shovel pass is often misunderstood. In reality, the shovel is just one element in a triple option. The quarterback can pitch it to the tight end (“the shovel”), run with it himself or pitch it to a running back on the edge. Meyer said Brantley needs to run outside the pocket faster and read the defense better. Part of the problem so far, Meyer said, has been the team’s inexperience. “The quarterback doing it is new, the people catching it [are] new and, up until now, a lot of linemen were shufﬂ  ed around,” he said. So alligatorSports’ Tyler Jett took a look at exactly what went wrong last week, and what the play looks like when correctly executed.
2nd and 10, Ball on the UF 31-yard line
USF lined up with ﬁ  ve at the line, including a linebacker to Brantley’s left. A 
defensive back on the same side crowded the line, as if he would blitz. Both the linebacker and safety 
rush up the ﬁ  eld, eliminating Brantley’s options to keep it or pitch it left to running back Jeff Demps, so he pitches it forward to ﬂ  ex back Trey Burton. Burton, who started the play on the right side of the ﬁ  eld, looks to run left when he gets the ball, but three Bulls defenders are waiting at the second level and the Gators only have two blockers, Carl Johnson and Jon Halapio. Either Omarius Hines was supposed to crack down on a linebacker from the slot receiver position, or USF read the play well. Either way, Florida gains just three yards.
3rd and 3, Ball on the USF 41-yard line
Florida lined up with three receivers right, and USF only put one corner on 
that side, choosing instead to keep three players deep and crowd the line with six defenders. At the 
snap, Brantley steps right, but a Bulls linebacker rushes up ﬁ  eld. Brantley pitches the ball inside to 
Hines, but two defensive lineman are waiting for him, stopping the play at the line of scrimmage. If 
Brantley pitched the ball right to Moody, the running back appeared to have an outside lane, and three 
Florida receivers were posted up on three USF defensive backs more than 10 yards downﬁ  eld.
2nd and Goal, Ball on the USF 7-yard line
USF lines up in a 4-3, but with both outside linebackers crowding the line of 
scrimmage. At the snap, Brantley steps left, meets a linebacker and pitches inside to Burton. Halapio, 
lined up on the right side, pulls and tries to kick out the left side defensive end, but he doesn’t make 
solid contact. When Halapio moves up ﬁ  eld to engage a middle linebacker, the end easily tackles Bur-
ton. With a solid block on the end, the Gators’ line might have formed a big enough hole inside for Burton 
to rush to the goal line. Brantley also might have been able to pitch left to Moody on the edge for a good 
play. As it is, Florida gained just two yards.FLORIDA STATE: Nov 28 SOUTH FLORIDA: Sept. 11
1st and 10, Ball 
on the FSU 18-
yard line
Before the snap, the Seminoles lined 
up in a 4-3 defense. When Tebow gets the ball and runs left, two line-backers and the strong safety ﬂ  ow with the play while the third outside linebacker is cut blocked by left tackle Xavier Nixon. Right guard Mike Pouncey pulled to the left side of the ﬁ  eld on the play and headed up to the linebackers. Because the lineback-ers had already ﬂ  owed far to the left, Pouncey posted his body inside FSU’s middle linebacker, making an easy block assuming Florida cuts the ball to the inside. And, reading the ﬂ  ow of the defense, Tebow does just that by pitching the ball to tight end Aaron Hernandez. Hernandez, who lined up on the right side of the ﬁ  eld before the snap, looped behind the line to the left side. Once he got the ball, he ran untouched into the end zone, sprung by Nixon’s and Pouncey’s blocks.1st Quarter 1st Quarter

But Tennessee blew a 10-point lead to LSU in the SEC 
Championship, reducing them to a Citrus Bowl ap-pearance.
A second national title would have put Rocky Top 
at the center of the college football universe the same 
way it did in The Swamp after 2008. The V olunteers 
remained a premier team, but they could have been the premier team.
Losing your hungerPhillip Fulmer became a full-time coach at Tennes-
see in 1980, just before Ali laced up his gloves for the last time. And just like the former champ, Fulmer was suspected of losing his edge in the 2000s.
Tennessee still recruited well, but the excitement 
generated by those signings ultimately just left fans even more disappointed.
Three years after signing the No. 2 class in the na-
tion, Tennessee received a No. 3 preseason ranking in 2005. They ended the year 5-6. The Vols were a dark-horse contender in 2008. Those dreams were dead by week three, when they fell to the Gators 30-6.
Losing your credibilityJustifiably, Fulmer was fired in 2008. His replace-
ment, who needs no introduction, entered Tennes-see riding a then-culturally relevant platform of “change.”
He brought a new swagger, landed some premier 
recruits and kept his fists clinched, ready to fight the baddest men in the conference like the newest pris-oner. He wasn’t successful in his first season, but he was new and fans were patient. They could take roadblocks. What they couldn’t take was the abrupt 
departure in January . 
And so here lies Tennessee. Their athletic director 
is under fire after watching a national championship 
contender become an afterthought incapable of bring-ing former assistant coaches back from Duke.  
What’s worse for Tennessee? A 48-13 loss at home 
against Oregon, or the fact that the result was precise-ly what everyone inside Neyland Stadium expected.
Does Rocky Top still feel like home sweet home?TYLER , from page 14Young players motivated to improve in practice
due to an injured back and an 
undiagnosed illness.
“I was excited to be able to 
go over there and play and get 
some results,” Mather said.
Playing against some of 
the top teams in the SEC was 
no easy feat and players were physically drained by the last day of competition, Thorn-qvist said. But the Gators showed the toughness and determination necessary to be one of the top team’s in the country this year.
“I really like this team,” he 
said. “This is the third year in a row that we have great, 
great chemistry in the locker 
room.”
While young players often 
need to be pushed, Mather doesn’t believe that will be necessary. She said her team-mates are motivated to get in shape and improve their games.
“It’s not very hard being 
a leader because everyone is pretty determined to get bet-ter,” Mather said. “I just want to be an example to them about the things to do on the court.”
With two top-10 sopho-
mores in Lauren Embree and Allie Will, and the depend-able Mather, the Gators have the right blend of talent and leadership this fall.TENNIS , from page 14

It was a tale of two nines. 
The UF women’s golf team — led 
by sophomore Mia Piccio’s second consecutive day with four birdies — shot three under par on the back nine 
at Yeaman’s Hall Golf Club on Mon-
day. 
Unfortunately for the No. 19 Gators, 
they were nine over on the front to fin-ish the second round of the Cougar Classic in sixth place with a team score of 10 over par.
Piccio birdied three of her last four 
holes to post an even-par round of 72 
and remain two under for the tourna-
ment. Also, junior Evan Jensen birdied two of her last four to post back-to-back rounds of 73. 
“I’m very proud of the way they 
finished,” coach Jan Dowling said. “That’s going to take momentum into tomorrow for them and for the rest of the team.”
Piccio and Jensen could have gone 
even lower. 
Both golfers had their rounds tar -
nished by a double bogey . Piccio’s came on the par-three sixth, a hole that cost the Gators five strokes Monday. 
“It’s a tough hole, you have to kind 
of hit it in the exact spot,” Dowling said. Sophomore Isabelle Lendl left her 
initial bunker shot in the sand on the way to a double bogey . 
“It kind of killed the momentum 
midway through the round,” she said. “It’s a very playable golf course, so to make double really sets you back in 
regards to the rest of the field.” 
Senior Jessica Yadloczky contin-
ued her consistent play , sandwiching 
two birdies between four bogeys for a two-over round of 74, one better than Sunday’s 75. 
A shaky shot right out of the gate 
led to a bogey on the first hole for junior An-
drea Watts. After a dou-
ble bogey on the fourth, Watts was quickly at three over par. But she remained steady and 
parred every remaining hole for a 75. 
“She had a lot of birdie putts that 
just didn’t fall,” Dowling said. “I think that was the theme of the day for our 
team. We’re hoping that it happens to-
morrow.”
Asked about her team’s chances of 
contending for the tournament title, coach Dowling was optimistic.
“There’s birdies out there for sure,” 
she said. “With this team, they all have the potential to be winning tourna-ments individually. If they all get hot 
at the same time, you never know.”16, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 2010

ENGLEWOOD, Colo. — Fans wishing to see more of Tim 
Tebow might get more of the same instead.
Broncos coach Josh McDaniels said Monday that he’s not 
planning to use his raw rookie quarterback much differently 
than he did in his NFL debut Sunday, when the former Florida 
star was on the field for just three snaps in Denver’s 24-17 loss.
The college football icon, who grew up in Jacksonville, en-
tered on the third play and gained a yard on a quarterback keeper on 1st-and-10, something he’d do again in the second quarter after lining up once at wide receiver.
Even when Tebow did go in, starting quarterback Kyle Or -
ton stayed on the field and called the plays that he received in his headset, and McDaniels said he’d like to keep it that way.
“I don’t think I have any desire to do that with Kyle coming 
off the field, coming on the field, coming off,” McDaniels said. “I don’t think that’s really something that we’re looking to do much of. Like I said yesterday after the game, I think our quar -
terback played pretty well. I think he will play well. (I have) great confidence in his ability to execute what we’re doing. And so we’d have to have something that would force us to make a decision like that and feel really good about it.”
Orton was masterful Sunday until the fourth quarter, when 
he threw a fourth-down pass that Brandon Lloyd couldn’t quite come down with in the end zone and then got picked off 
on his final drive in the closing seconds.
McDaniels said he would have used Tebow more had his 
carries been more productive.
“It was just a portion of the game plan that we wanted to go 
ahead and put in there. If it gave us some benefits, great. We 
threw a pass or two out of it, completed them. A couple of runs, didn’t do much with those,” McDaniels said.McDaniels: Tebow to see limited playing time for now
