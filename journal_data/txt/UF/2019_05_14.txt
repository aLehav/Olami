Things were looking up for the 
Florida Gators football team at 
the start of spring.
Head coach Dan Mullen had 
just raked in what looked to be 
a very promising class. With 17 
four-star recruits, it earned a No. 
9 ranking from 247Sports and in-
cluded the highest-rated UF re-
cruit since 2016 in California na-
tive Chris Steele.
“I’d think we did a poor job 
recruiting if guys were coming 
in and then immediately walking 
out the door because it was some-
thing different than what they 
thought it would be,” Mullen said 
in March.
Two months later, his highly-
ranked class began to waver.
The ﬁ  rst hit came from Jalon 
Jones, a freshman quarterback 
who was battling with redshirt 
junior Kyle Trask for the third 
string spot. Jones mysteriously 
entered the transfer portal in late 
April, but the reason soon be- Transfers and decommits not ideal for Mullen and Florida

NO STUDENTS WERE 
HARMED IN THE 
ROBBERY
By Kelly Hayes
Staff Writer
A UF faculty member, staff 
member and 21 UF students in the 
Lombardi & Stamps Scholarship 
program, part of the UF Honors 
Program, were robbed at gunpoint Monday morning local time (six 
hours ahead of Gainesville) near 
Pretoria, South Africa, UF spokes-
person Steve Orlando wrote in an 
email. The students, faculty mem-
ber and staff member were on a 
UF sanctioned trip. 
This is the ﬁ  rst time an incident 
like this has happened on this bi-
annual trip, Orlando said. UF will 
be evaluating this program and 
location.
The students and staff were on a bus headed from the University 
of Pretoria to visit a nearby town-
ship, Orlando said. A car with six 
armed gunmen followed the bus 
through a security gate.
The gunmen stopped the bus, 
ordered everyone off and marched 
them at gunpoint to a nearby 
kindergarten classroom, Orlando 
said. 
Once in the classroom, with the 
schoolchildren also in the room, 
members of the UF group were or-dered to hand over all their valu-
ables, he said. The group cooper-
ated, and the gunmen left. 
No UF students were physi-
cally harmed, and local residents 
came to protect the UF group, Or-
lando said. One local resident was 
grazed by a bullet and another 
was pistol-whipped, and the UF 
students provided them with ﬁ  rst 
aid.
“We’re just tremendously 
thankful that everyone is OK and grateful to the local residents who 
came to help our group,” Orlando 
said. 
The students are now back at 
the University of Pretoria, where 
they met with counselors and U.S. 
Embassy personnel, he said. Three 
students are in the process of re-
turning to the U.S.

THE PIANO BAR HAS BEEN 
OPEN SINCE 2010
By Rosmery Izaguirre
Staff Writer
Rockeys Dueling Piano Bar will 
host a “Final Celebration Before 
Celebration Pointe” on Saturday at 
8 p.m. before closing its doors.
The festivities at the bar, 112 S. 
Main St., will include a performance 
by one of its owners, Brad Heron, 
in addition to America’s Got Talent 
participant Mike Stone and others.The piano bar has been owned 
by Heron and Scott Schmailzl since 
it opened in 2010.
“It’s going to be a ﬁ  nal goodbye 
celebration for all the good times 
we’ve had,” Heron said. “We’ve 
been blessed to have an amazing 
run with great patrons these past 10 
years and look forward to bringing 
that same energy level to entertain 
everyone at The Keys.”
Heron is closing the bar to focus 
on The Keys, a seafood restaurant 
opening in Celebration Pointe, he 
said. The Keys will be co-owned by Heron, Tony Espetia, former owner 
of the now-closed Rum Runners and 
Fat Tuesday in Gainesville, and Di-
ego Ibanez, co-owner of Emiliano’s 
Cafe at 7 SE 1st Ave. The Keys will 
show what Gainesville and Florida 
have to offer by using local prod-
ucts, Heron said.
Rockeys will have ﬁ  nal shows 
on Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m. 
before the “Final Celebration Before 
Celebration Pointe” on Saturday, 
Heron said.

THIS WAS FLORIDA 
GOV . RON DESANTIS’ 
FIRST VETO
By Tien Le
Staff Writer
Get your reusable straws 
ready: Florida Governor Ron De-
Santis vetoed a bill that would 
have prohibited plastic straw 
bans. 
Gov. DeSantis received and 
vetoed House Bill 771 on Friday, 
despite being given until May 25 
to act on the bill. It was the ﬁ  rst 
time the governor used his veto 
power. 
HB 771 included a section 
regarding the local regulation 
of single-use plastic straws. The 
bill stated that before July 1, 
2024, Florida counties or munic-
ipalities would not be allowed 
to adopt or enforce regulations 
relating to single-use plastic 
straws. 
Vetoing the bill allows Flori-
da counties to implement single-
use plastic straw bans. 
Sanibel, Ft. Myers Beach and 
Miami Beach have already en-
acted single-use plastic straw 
bans, Desantis said in a veto 
letter explaining why he vetoed 
the bill.  “These measures have not, 
as far as I can tell, frustrated 
any state policy or harmed the 
state’s interests,” DeSantis said. 
“In fact, the Florida Department 
of Environmental Protection has 
encouraged Florida residents, 
schools and businesses to re-
duce plastic straw use.” 
The city of Gainesville has 
not taken up a single-use plastic 
straw ban, it has only been in 
discussion, Chip Skinner, a city 
of Gainesville spokesperson, 
said. The city did pass a single-
use plastic and styrofoam ban in 
January.
Mark Sexton, Alachua Coun-
ty spokesperson, said the coun-
ty commission is very support-
ive of the veto, especially due 
to the harm plastic straws can 
cause marine life. The commis-
sion has been working on their 
own single-use plastic ban.
“It was a good veto because 
it showed a respect for home-
rule and local governments,” 
Sexton said. “The governor ba-
sically said in his explanation 
of the veto that he thought that 
this should be handled at the lo-
cal level, and we support that.”

4   ALLIGATOR    TUESDAY, MAY 14, 2019THE PANTRY WILL MORE THAN 
DOUBLE IN SIZE
By Meleah Lyden 
Staff Writer
    More resources may soon be available 
for food-insecure students and faculty at 
UF. 
UF is expanding the Alan and Cathy 
Hitchcock Field & Fork Food Pantry to al-
low for more space to display non-perish-
able food and fresh produce, said Heather 
White, UF dean of students. The expansion, 
which will more than double the size of the 
current pantry, will also create a space for 
storage, processing donations and a cooking 
demonstration area. 
“The purpose is to expand the facilities 
so that we can provide more resources to 
help combat food insecurities — to help 
supply more for both students and faculty,” 
White said.
During the expansion construction, the 
pantry will operate from Rawlings Hall in-
stead of its normal location near the Reitz 
Union, White said.  The expansion has been a goal for a 
couple years now as the current facility has been running low on space, she said. Con-
struction on the pantry should be complete by Fall 2019.
To fund the expansion, the Capital Im-
provement Trust Fund will pay $635,000, 
along with a $150,000 gift from Alan and 
Cathy Hitchcock, said UF spokesperson 
Steve Orlando. 
Deneen Wang, a 21-year-old UF micro-
biology and cell sciences senior, volunteers 
at the pantry and thinks the expansion will 
help those who are using it, she wrote in 
an email. 
In addition to volunteering at the pantry, 
Wang has known friends who couldn’t af-
ford their next month’s rent and have relied 
on the pantry to alleviate food insecurities. 
Wang said she hopes the expansion will 
help UF students recognize the pantry as an 
available resource to them.
“When I last volunteered at the pantry, 
we had trouble figuring out how to fit ev-
erything that was donated into the shelves,” 
she said. “I hope that with the expansion, 
more of UF will know about the pantry and 
have greater access to it.”

THEY HELD A SIGN THAT 
READ “UF USES SLAVE 
LABOR”
Josephine Fuller
Staff Writer
Amid fellow UF graduates with 
decorated caps and flags of their 
country of origin, Juan Esteban 
Zapata revealed a banner on the 
O’Connell Center’s jumbotron. It 
read “UF uses slave labor” in large 
black letters. 
Zapata, 23, protested UF Institute 
of Food and Agricultural Sciences’ 
use of prison labor as he graduated with a bachelor’s in electrical engi-
neering at the May 5 ceremony for 
the College of Engineering.
A video of Zapata walking across 
the stage holding up the banner was 
tweeted by Divest UF, a group that 
seeks to divest UF’s endowments 
from fossil fuel industries, the 
prison labor industry and arms and 
surveillance companies, its website 
said. 
Zapata has been an organizer 
with Divest UF since it started about 
a year ago, he said. The group’s 
Twitter bio says it started in March 
2018.   
“UF contracts over 100 incarcer-
ated workers a day,” Zapata said. “They receive no compensation... 
the Florida Department of Correc-
tions pays $2 an hour per laborer.”
The students had the right to 
hold up signs during their own 
graduations, UF spokesperson Steve 
Orlando said. The contracts that UF 
has with the correctional institu-
tions are under review by the uni-
versity.
Earlier that day at the College of 
Liberal Arts and Sciences ceremony, 
Syed Muhammad Omar, stood up 
with the same sign when his name 
was called and again while the cer-
emony was paused. Zapata said he 
was inspired by Omar. 
Omar, a 27-year-old UF psychol-ogy bachelor’s graduate, said he is 
also involved with Divest UF. 
Jeanna Mastrodicasa, the asso-
ciate vice president for operations 
with UF’s Institute of Food and Ag-
ricultural Sciences, said UF does not 
hire any incarcerated men or wom-
en directly. Instead, the university 
acts as a host site for correctional 
work programs. 
“They are not our employees, so 
we contract the correctional institu-
tion,” Mastrodicasa said. “Some re-
ceive some pay, but they’re not our 
employees.” 
Some workers receive benefits 
such as reducing their sentence, 
Mastrodicasa said. The maximum number of these 
individuals contracted through UF 
at any time is about 100, Mastrodi-
casa said. They are largely used in 
IFAS for farming purposes. 
After last year’s controversy 
when multiple black students were 
rushed off the stage, Zapata said he 
didn’t think he would be pushed off 
the stage for displaying the sign.
“They didn’t really do anything 
to police me,” Zapata said. “I tried 
being considerate of the people be-
hind me. So, I kept the message 
brief.”

A UF PROFESSOR WILL BE 
LEADING THE CENTER
Charlie Daffron
Staff Writer
UF will participate in advancing 
national technologies this week. 
UF is hosting a two-day seminar, 
which started on Monday, to com-
memorate the launch of the Center 
of Excellence in Assured Autonomy 
in conjunction with the Air Force Of-
fice of Scientific Research, said UF 
spokesperson Steve Orlando. 
The goal of the center is to create 
systems that require less human in-
tervention to assist in offensive and 
defensive international relations. 
Dr. Warren Dixon, a UF mechani-
cal engineering professor, will lead 
the center in collaboration with 10 
leading researchers, including facul-
ty from Duke University, University 
of California, Santa Cruz and Univer-
sity of Texas at Austin. 
“This is a terrific opportunity for the university,” Orlando said. “It’s 
an honor to be able to host it and see 
faculty in the College of Engineering 
get to interact in that way.” 
The center will work to make 
technological advancements to help 
the U.S. stay ahead of its adversaries 
in the fields of science and technol-
ogy. 
Sponsorship will come from the 
Air Force Office of Scientific Re-
search and the Munitions, Sensors 
and Space Vehicles directorates 
within the Air Force Research Labo-
ratory. Funding will total $6 million 
over six years, divided into three 
two-year $2 million increments.
The seminar will cover many 
technical aspects of the research 
topics the center’s investigators will 
work on and will include presenta-
tions from UF students showcasing 
research that is already in progress, 
Orlando said.

TWO STUDENTS WERE 
CHARGED BY THE STATE 
ATTORNEY’S OFFICE
By Rachael Schirmer
Staff Writer
Messages shared among sev-
eral students on Snapchat in March 
were reported to Eastside High 
School and Alachua County Sher-
iff’s Office on Thursday for threats 
of a school shooting. Parents were 
informed by school officials Friday. 
The messages were shared in a 
closed group of students, accord-
ing to ACSO public information of-
ficer Lt. Brett Rhodenizer. A threat 
made by one student read “shot up 
the school,” assumed by authorities 
to be misspelled, and meant to say 
“shoot up the school.” The message 
was shared with photographs of at 
least two students with guns. The 
photographs were date-stamped 
late March. The guns were later de-
termined to be BB guns.Two students were charged via 
the State Attorney’s Office under 
statute 836.10. The statute prohibits 
written threats to kill, bodily injure 
others or conduct a mass shooting. 
Students involved are being disci-
plined, said Alachua County Public 
Schools spokeswoman Jackie John-
son. 
Lt. Rhodenizer said that while 
the investigation is ongoing, there 
is no immediate threat. Deputies 
and school officials identified the 
students involved and deemed that 
they did not have the means to car-
ry out the threat that day.
Lt. Rhodenizer stressed the im-
portance of parents supervising 
their child’s mobile activities. 
“These are teenagers, children, utilizing a messaging platform,” 
Rhodenizer said. “Parents, know 
what’s on your kid’s phone and 
monitor that content.”
The “school guardian” bill, SB 
7030, which would allow in-class-
room teachers to volunteer for gun 
training to have a gun on campus 
as an added security measure, was 
passed by Florida Senate in April. 
Alachua County will not be par-
ticipating in the program, Johnson 
said.  
“Some of the folks involved 
thought it was a joke,” Rhodenizer 
said. “We can’t afford to handle 
anything as a joke.”

SHE HAS A $12,000 BOND  
By Lina Ruiz 
Staff Writer
A Gainesville woman accused of 
stealing credit cards thought she proved 
her innocence to an ofﬁ  cer by showing 
him the contents of her wallet on Sun-
day afternoon. 
Although the wallet of Ashley Cox, 
30, contained no stolen credit cards, it 
did contain syringes, pills and a spoon 
with residue, according to a Gainesville 
Police Department arrest report. 
A woman who rented rooms 175 and 
177 at the DoubleTree hotel, located at 
3726 SW 40th Blvd., told the ofﬁ  cer she 
was missing her credit cards and be-
lieved Cox took them, the report said. 
Cox was sleeping in room 175 when 
she woke up to answer the door for 
an ofﬁ  cer at 12:30 p.m. The ofﬁ  cer in-
formed Cox about the missing cards, 
the report said. She told the ofﬁ  cer she did not have them and 
that he could search 
the hotel room. 
Cox emptied the 
contents of her hand-
bag onto the bed. This 
is when the ofﬁ  cer 
found the drug-related 
items, the report said.
After Cox was read 
her Miranda rights, she told the ofﬁ  cer 
the pills belonged to the other woman’s 
daughter, while the syringes and spoon 
belonged to a friend, the report said. Cox 
did not have a prescription for the pills 
found. 
Cox was charged with possession 
and use of drug paraphernalia and two 
counts of possession of a controlled sub-
stance. She remains in Alachua County 
jail in lieu of a $12,000 bond.

A Gainesville man could not run away 
from his problems on Monday morning.
An ofﬁ  cer responded to a call about a 
suspicious vehicle at about 3:50 a.m. where 
Roberto James Baldinelli, 41, was sitting 
shirtless on a scooter behind Alley Gatorz 
at 2606 NE Waldo Road.
The ofﬁ  cer recognized Baldinelli be-
cause he previously arrested him on drug 
charges, according to a Gainesville Police 
Department report. Baldinelli said he was 
waiting for his girlfriend.  
Baldinelli started to run when the ofﬁ  cer 
began to read the scooter’s tag to dispatch 
to check if it was stolen, the report said. 
Baldinelli ran for about 200 yards before 
coming face-to-face with a chain-link fence. 
He gave up and spontaneously stated he 
had “dope” on him and had a warrant, the report said.
A warrant check by the 
ofﬁ  cer revealed Baldinelli 
had a felony warrant for 
drug possession reference 
failure to appear, the re-
port said.
Further inspection of 
the scooter revealed the 
scooter’s ignition was hanging by a wire, a 
common indication that a vehicle has been 
stolen, the report said. The ofﬁ  cer found 
that the scooter had a stolen motorcycle tag 
on it.
Baldinelli had a glass pipe and plastic 
bag with residue, items consistent with 
methamphetamine use, the report said. 
Baldinelli is charged with grand theft of 
motor vehicles, possession of drug para-
phernalia, and resisting an ofﬁ  cer without 
violence in lieu of a $35,000 bond.

FIFTY-ONE UNITS 
ARE CLOSED FOR 
MAINTENANCE ISSUES
By T ori Whidden 
Staff Writer  UF graduate students do not 
need to fear the closing of any 
graduate housing villages.
Michael Sanchez, mayor of the 
UF Corry Village, filed a petition on 
May 3 to oppose the rumored clos-
ing of Maguire Village and Univer-
sity Village South, he said. Howev-
er, the UF housing department has 
denied the closing of these apart-
ments. 
Although no buildings or villages 
will be closing in the near future, a 
number of apartment units have 
been unavailable in Maguire Village 
and University Village South. 
These two buildings have 51 out 
of their 358 units unavailable for 
the 2019-2020 academic year due to 
maintenance and operations issues, 
the interim Vice President for Stu-
dent Affairs, Winfred Phillips, wrote 
in an email response to the petition. 
Phillips said the department is doing what is in the residents’ best 
interests. 
 The housing department said 
it anticipates being able to accom-
modate similar numbers of graduate 
students and their families as in pre-
vious years, Phillips said. 
Since last August, students have complained to the UF Mayor’s 
Council regarding their denied ap-
plications to the Maguire Village 
and University Village South. More 
than 200 people signed the petition 
on Change.org, Sanchez said. 
Residents from these villages 
and the other graduate housing as-sumed the two villages were likely 
to be closed in the near future be-
cause of the number of denied ap-
plications, Sanchez said. 
“If you remove almost two-thirds 
of the villages for graduate and fam-
ily housing, you’re removing the 
campus experience,” Sanchez said. “You’re removing the academic ex-
perience.” 
Sanchez is concerned that if 
graduate housing is reduced, then 
the number of graduate students 
will decrease.
“If our mission statement is to 
rise in prominence and become a 
top five university, how are we go-
ing to do this if we are eliminating 
the people who do the research?” 
Sanchez said. “They are the back-
bone of the university, academically 
wise.” 
 Ali Alquraishi signed Sanchez’s 
petition when he heard about it, 
having lived in the UF Maguire Vil-
lage with his son for three years, he 
said. 
Through the graduate housing 
facilities, he worked for Maguire 
Village as a community assistant 
and sent his son to the university 
daycare, he said. 
“Tearing down this village 
would affect me tremendously,” 
Alquraishi said. “This place is af-
fordable, convenient and I feel it’s 
extremely safe for not only myself, 
but for my son.”

ABOUT 180 STUDENTS HAVE SENT AN 
RSVP FOR THE MAKEUP CEREMONY
By Kelly Hayes
Staff Writer
Samuel Swanson chose to sit with his fel-
low statistics graduates Sunday morning at the 
College of Liberal Arts and Sciences graduation. 
The 22-year-old could have chosen to sit with two other majors, mathematics or com-
puter science, as he was graduating with three 
degrees. But, he chose to be called with statis-
tics at the ceremony, because that’s where his 
friends were sitting, he said. 
He didn’t know that choice would mean he 
would not be recognized on the main stage.
Instead, Swanson’s recognition occurred in-
side a cramped stadium corridor near the north 
endzone where graduates could take photos 
with the CLAS dean, David 
Richardson, and be called 
in a smaller recognition of 
names.
“It definitely felt like not 
nearly the same,” he said. “I 
mean, one, my family wasn’t 
able to see me do that be-
cause they were on the op-
posite side of the stadium at 
the time.”
Swanson was one of a 
few hundred students who 
did not get recognized on 
the main stage of the CLAS 
graduation in the Ben Hill 
Griffin Stadium after light-
ning caused the ceremony to 
be canceled. 
Despite troubles with the 
initial ceremony, Swanson is planning on attending the makeup ceremony 
set for May 18 at the O’Connell Center. At least 
180 other graduates have sent an RSVP for the 
ceremony, UF spokesperson Steve Orlando 
said. 
However, even with the announcement of 
the indoors makeup ceremony, UF students 
are still voicing their frustrations. 
Mackintosh Joachim, president of UF 
NAACP, issued a statement on behalf of the 
organization. It included demands calling for 
the resignation of Director of Commencements 
Stephanie McBride, a formal apology from the 
marshall who pushed several black students at 
the 2018 CLAS commencement and a full re-
fund of CLAS graduates’ caps and gowns. 
“I think that the makeup ceremony is a 
joke,” Joachim said. 
As a child of immigrants, Cheyenne Cheng, 
a 22-year-old UF graduate with a bachelor’s in 
psychology, understands the importance of the 
ceremony for families. Cheng considers herself 
one of the lucky graduates who was able to 
walk.
But after the issues with the ceremony, 
Cheng crafted a list of demands in a state-
ment released with Joachim, Anthony Rojas, 
a 23-year-old UF political science master’s 
student and leader of the university-wide com-
mencement boycott, along with other CLAS 
graduates, she said. In addition to the points listed in NAACP’s 
release, this statement also called for more stu-
dent and family input in planning the ceremo-
nies as well as free graduation photos for CLAS 
graduates. 
“I specifically advocated for our own list 
of demands, just because I know that when it 
comes to institutions, they will apologize, and 
they will set up committees, but if you don’t 
give them parameters to work with, you can’t 
really hold them to anything,” she said.
Rojas also released a petition calling for the 
resignation of McBride, which has more than 
3,100 signatures as of Monday evening.  
The university does not have a response to 
the statements and petitions, Orlando said. 
For Swanson, even with the makeup cer-
emony, it’s too little too late. Many of Swan-
son’s relatives who came to the original cer-
emony are from Texas and will not be able 
to make another, and will instead watch the 
livestream. 
“Before the ceremony I wasn’t like, ‘Oh, 
like graduation is something that I need to 
do,’” he said. “But I mean, I knew my family 
would want to see me graduate, so that was 
mainly why I went.”

SHE WAS KNOWN FOR MOVIES 
“PILLOW TALK” AND “THE MAN 
WHO KNEW TOO MUCH”
By Julia Rubin
The Associated Press
Doris Day, the sunny blond ac-
tress and singer whose frothy come-
dic roles opposite the likes of Rock Hudson and Cary Grant made her 
one of Hollywood’s biggest stars in 
the 1950s and ’60s and a symbol of 
wholesome American womanhood, 
died Monday. She was 97.
In more recent years, Day had 
been an animal rights advocate. 
Her Doris Day Animal Foundation 
confirmed her death at her Carmel 
Valley, California, home.Day “had been in excellent 
physical health for her age” but had 
recently contracted pneumonia, the 
foundation said in a statement. She 
requested that no memorial ser-
vices be held and no grave marker 
erected.
With her lilting contralto, fresh-
faced beauty and glowing smile, 
Day was a top box-office draw and 
recording artist known for com-
edies such as “Pillow Talk” and 
“That Touch of Mink,” as well as songs like “Whatever Will Be, Will 
Be (Que Sera, Sera)” from the Al-
fred Hitchcock film “The Man Who 
Knew Too Much.”
Day received a Presidential 
Medal of Freedom in 2004. Al-
though mostly retired from show 
business since the 1980s, she still 
had enough of a following that a 
2011 collection of previously unre-
leased songs, “My Heart,” hit the 
top 10 in the United Kingdom. The 
same year, she received a lifetime achievement honor from the Los 
Angeles Film Critics Association.
The Humane Society of the 
United States, of which The Doris 
Day Animal League is an affiliate, 
praised Day as a pioneer in animal 
protection.
In 1987, Day “founded one of 
the first national animal protection 
organizations dedicated to legisla-
tive remedies for the worst animal 
abuse,” said the league’s executive 
director, Sara Amundson. Actress Doris Day dies at 97TUESDAY, MAY 14, 2019   ALLIGATOR   7
Amelia Golden, 6, and her 3-year-old brother, Dylan, paint on mini-canvases Sunday afternoon 
during the Mother’s Day Celebration at First Magnitude Brewing Company. The painting station, 
provided by Painting with a Twist, allowed children to create up to three paintings for their 
mothers or other family members. Amelia said she painted a butterﬂ  y, a rainbow and a unicorn.Leila Dylla, 27, finishes her yoga class Sunday afternoon during First Magnitude Brewing Company’s Mother’s Day Celebration. Dylla has been teaching yoga for 
eight years and often travels to different locations around the state and outside of the country to instruct yoga classes. Dylla said she believes people practice yoga 
to become more content and steady the mind. “It brings me joy to see people become happier, ” Dylla said.
Leila Dylla, 27, teaches yoga Sunday to a group of about 70 people at First 
Magnitude Brewing Company’s Mother’s Day Celebration. First Magnitude 
offers yoga classes every Sunday with a different instructor each week. Dylla 
said she usually spends her time traveling but came to town Sunday to visit 
her family in Micanopy for Mother’s Day.
G
uests at First Magnitude Brewing 
Company celebrated Mother’s Day 
on Sunday afternoon with a series of 
sponsored activities. About 70 people 
attended the special edition of the 
weekly yoga class. There was also a painting 
station, sponsored by Painting with a Twist, 
where children could create mini-canvas 
paintings for their mothers and other family 
members. Later, there was a session with a 
painting class for moms. The event also had 
live music from the band Patchwork Girls.

The Florida lacrosse team 
bounced back from a rough start 
to the 2019 campaign.
It closed out the regular season 
and conference tournament on an 
11-game win streak after losing 
six out of its first nine games.
UF’s strong finish led to Amer-
ican Athletic Conference champi-
onships in both the regular sea-
son and in the AAC Tournament.
But the No. 17 Gators fell short 
of expectations after losing 15-
11 to No. 3-seed North Carolina 
in the second round of the NCAA 
Tournament on Sunday. Florida 
has advanced to the national tour-
nament every year since 2011, in-
cluding a Final Four appearance 
in 2012, but has never won it in 
the program’s 10-year history.
Senior attacker Lindsey Ron-
beck was at the forefront of a UF 
attack that finished 10th in the 
nation in scoring offense (15.43 
goals per game). She leads the 
nation in goals with 89 and is ranked fifth in goals per game at 
4.24.
Ronbeck also became the third 
Gator to break the 200-goal mark, 
doing so in a 15-8 triumph over 
Temple on March 30. She ended 
her career as the second-leading 
goalscorer in school history with 
242. Ronbeck was 14 goals shy of 
tying the school record held by 
former midfielder Shannon Gilroy 
(256).
Sophomore midfielder Shan-
non Kavanagh will replace Ron-
beck as the focal point of the of-
fense next season. 
Kavanagh registered 69 goals 
and a team-high 26 assists 
throughout the 2019 campaign. 
Her 95 points were good enough 
for second on the team behind 
Ronbeck’s 107.
The sophomore served as Flor-
ida’s primary draw taker, too.
She won a team-high 93 draws 
and led the Gators to 15.14 draw 
controls per game (20th in the na-
tion).Florida falls short of national title despite success in the AAC

SOFTBALL

The Gators softball team rejoiced in 
victory on Saturday, though the season is 
far from over.
No. 9 Florida had much to celebrate 
after defeating No. 4 Alabama in a 2-1 
thriller in College Station, Texas.
It secured its second-consecutive SEC 
Tournament title and made up for a three-
game sweep on its home turf against its 
storied conference foe less than a month 
ago.
Senior ace Kelly Barnhill displayed her 
usual dominance all week, finishing the 
tournament with a 3-0 record, a 0.33 ERA 
and a .075 opponent batting average, more 
than enough to earn Tournament MVP.
The offense showed signs of activity, 
and outfielder Amanda Lorenz, shortstop 
Sophia Reynoso and infielder Hannah 
Adams were recognized on the SEC All-
Tournament team alongside Barnhill for their efforts with the bats.
The celebrations must quickly come 
to an end, however, because the NCAA 
Regionals begin this week.
UF understands this all too well.
Such is evidently the case when it has 
appeared in 17 straight NCAA tourna-
ments, with nine trips to the Elite Eight 
of college softball – the Women’s College 
World Series – where the Gators notched 
back-to-back national championships in 
2014 and ’15.
The road to the Women’s College World 
Series truly begins this weekend, when the 
Gators’ Katie Seashole Pressly Stadium will 
open its gates to host an NCAA Regional 
for the 15th consecutive year – one for 
each year of Tim Walton’s reign as coach.
National No. 5 seed Florida will play 
host to Stanford, Boise State, and Boston 
University from May 17 through the 19. 
The winner of the double-elimination re-
gional will stay in Gainesville for the Super Gators host NCAA Regional 
with momentum on their sideSEE LACROSSE,  PAGE 12

The Florida baseball team dropped 
two out of three to Tennessee over the 
weekend in Gainesville.
In what was the team’s final series of 
2019 at McKethan Stadium, the Gators 
missed on a couple huge opportunities to 
bolster their NCAA Tournament resume.
After a promising 10-9 comeback win 
in Game 1 of the series, Florida sputtered 
in Games 2 and 3, giving up leads in both 
contests.
UF did more than enough from the 
plate to put itself in a position to sweep 
the Volunteers.
UF produced 21 runs on 32 hits over the 
course of the series.
Shortstop Brady McConnell and 
designated hitter Nelson Maldonado led 
the charge, going a combined 12 for 27 
with five home runs and eight RBIs.
Maldonado had the best performance from a Gator on Friday, hitting two 
homers, including the two-run shot that 
put his team up 10-9 in the eighth inning. 
The captain continues to perform at a 
high level during SEC play. He’s batting 
.322 with seven home runs and 18 RBIs 
through 27 SEC games.
McConnell has been even more 
impressive.
The sophomore showed off his power 
against Tennessee, blasting three home 
runs during the series. He had two on 
Saturday, including a 422-foot bomb to the 
deepest part of the park.
McConnell currently leads the team in 
batting average (.365), home runs (15), 
hits (73) and RBIs (45).
Florida’s bats brought it back from a 9-2 
deficit in Game 1, gave the team a two-run 
lead in Game 2, and a three-run lead to-
ward the end of Game 3.
Unfortunately for the Gators, the pitch-
ing staff let Tennessee spoil those advan-An inability to close dooms

came clear: he had been accused of sexual assault 
by two UF students.
Florida’s capstone fell soon after. Steele an-
nounced he was entering the transfer portal on May 
9, reportedly due to his frustration with his room-
mate in Jones and the UF staff’s refusal to move 
him until summer.
It didn’t stop there. Three four-star UF recruits 
for 2021 – wide receiver Trevonte Rucker, athlete 
Dink Jackson and defensive end Bryce Langston 
– all decommitted during and in the aftermath of 
Steele’s transfer.
So what does this all mean for Mullen’s future?
For 2019, it won’t mean much.
While Steele was taking ﬁ  rst team reps in the 
spring, the Gators still have considerable depth at 
the cornerback position.
The DB corps is spearheaded by junior CJ Hen-
derson, who made Coaches’ Second Team All-SEC 
Honors and had a team-high seven pass breakups 
and two forced fumbles. This year is also likely to 
see the return of cornerback Marco Wilson, who 
played two games before tearing his ACL. Round-
ing out the depth at corner is sophomore Trey Dean 
III, who earned a Coaches’ Freshman All-SEC nod and ranked second on the team in pass breakups 
with six.
In 2021, though, Florida could feel an impact 
from its recent decomits.
The Gators currently have a very young defen-
sive line, with only two underclassmen among its 
current members. Many of UF’s playmakers – such 
as Jabari Zuniga – won’t be with the team much 
longer, and losing out on a four-star recruit like 
Langston will leave Florida still searching for young 
talent on the defensive line when 2021 rolls around.
The team faces a similar situation with its wide-
outs. Only one Florida receiver, redshirt freshman 
Jacob Copeland, is an underclassman, and play-
makers in the passing game such as senior Tyrie 
Cleveland and redshirt senior Van Jefferson will 
graduate without Rucker to replace them like Flor-
ida hoped.
Dan Mullen’s team may not feel the effects of the 
past week right now, but the future is very much in 
doubt as the building blocks to his long term plan 
have slipped.

Sophomores John Axelsen 
and Chris Nido headlined a 
solid start to the ﬁ  rst round 
of the NCAA Regional Tour-
nament for the Florida men’s 
golf team.
The two led Florida with 
3-under opening rounds 
each, resulting in a sixth 
place tie for the team after 
Day 1 of a three day event.
Axelsen, notched as Flor-
ida’s top golfer for the tour-
nament, stayed clean in Pull-
man, Washington, with a 
bogey-free round. The Dane 
carded a birdie on the eighth 
hole, and followed up with 
two more on the back nine 
to complete his ninth place 
start. 
Nido had a stronger start 
to his round with two quick 
birdies on holes four and 
ﬁ  ve, before dropping back 
to even after two bogeys on 
the following three holes. Af-
ter calming down, the Miami 
native out of Gulliver Prep 
carded three birdies in the 
ﬁ  nal four holes to ﬁ  nish tied 
with Axelsen in ninth place. 
The remaining three 
Gators’ weren’t as fortunate on the Palouse Ridge course. 
Gordon Neale, Eugene Hong 
and Blake Dyer failed to ﬁ  n-
ish under-par on the round. 
Neale notched three bogies 
in the ﬁ  rst 11 holes before 
carding a birdie on the 14th 
to save his round at even par. 
Despite two birdies on the 
front nine for Hong, a dou-
ble-bogey on the fourth hole 
leveled his ﬁ  rst nine at even. 
His back nine was much 
more chaotic. The freshman 
carded four bogeys in a sev-
en-hole span with just two 
birdies, resulting in a 2-over 
ﬁ  nish tied at 58th place. 
Dyer closed things out for 
Florida as the No. 5 golfer 
with a relatively quiet round. 
The redshirt junior notched 
three birdies and just one 
bogey. A triple bogey on 17 
blemished his round into a 
1-over ﬁ  nish. 
Florida stands tied with 
South Carolina, UCLA and 
Purdue in sixth, and needs a 
top-ﬁ  ve ﬁ  nish after the third 
day of play to advance to the 
NCAA Championships.

Coming off of an impressive, gritty 
SEC Tournament performance with all 
phases of the game looking solid, the 
Gators have the opportunity to make

Amanda Lorenz was one of four Florida players to make the All-SEC 
T ournament team. She hit a game-winning double in the SEC title game.
Junior defender Cara 
Trombetta was the anchor of 
UF’s defense this year, start-
ing in every game of the sea-
son.
Her team-high 40 caused 
turnovers gave her 109 for 
her career. She became Flor-
ida’s all-time leader in that 
category in an 18-9 victory 
against Vanderbilt on April 
6, surpassing former defend-
er Caroline Fitzgerald’s mark 
of 87.
Senior goalkeeper Haley 
Hicklen had a busy season in 
the cage for the Gators.
She recorded a career-
high 184 saves but also al-
lowed the most goals in her 
four years at UF (218).
Hicklen broke former goalkeeper Mikey Meagher’s 
record of 407 career saves 
in a 15-12 loss to Loyola on 
Feb. 23.
Ronbeck, Hicklen, Trom-
betta and Kavanagh all 
earned AAC Player of the 
Year honors for their respec-
tive positions. They were 
also selected to the AAC First 
Team, along with senior 
midfielder Sydney Pirreca, 
sophomore attacker Grace 
Haus and sophomore defend-
er Sabrina Cristodero.
Although Florida domi-
nated in the AAC, its play did 
not translate to the NCAA 
Tournament, once more 
shattering UF’s dream of 
bringing home the national 
title.

SOFTBALL,  from pg. 10Gators face Boston University on Fridaytages by giving up big innings on 
Saturday and Sunday.
After scoring two runs to go up 
3-1 in the fourth inning on Satur-
day, Florida yielded five runs to 
the Volunteers during the fifth.
A similar occurrence happened 
on Sunday, as the Gators extend-
ed their lead to 4-1 in the fifth 
only for UT to score four and take 
a one-run lead in the seventh.
“It’s frustrating,” coach Kevin 
O’Sullivan said after Saturday’s 
loss. “When we get momentum and score some runs, it’s the 
pitcher’s responsibility to go out 
there and put up a zero.”
After a stellar performance on 
Friday, the bullpen had a hand in 
both of the collapses the rest of 
the series.
 Ben Specht came in for starter 
Jack Leftwich on Saturday, look-
ing to shut down the Volunteers 
and preserve the two-run lead.
Instead, he gave up hits to all 
three of the batters he faced. Four 
runs came across to score before 
he was pulled by O’Sullivan.
On Sunday, right-hander No-
lan Crisp hoped to give starter Nick Pogue (5.1 innings, one hit, 
one earned run) the opportunity 
to earn his first-career victory.
That hope quickly evaporated 
after the freshman gave up four 
earned runs on four hits during 
just one inning of action.
“We need to get better and 
move forward,” O’Sullivan said 
on Sunday. “We got three games 
left, we’re gonna battle like heck 
and get ready to go and play Mis-
souri.”
