LEXINGTON, Ky. — After a 
week from hell, No. 20 Florida 
traveled to the Bluegrass State in need of a boost. 
Tyler Murphy provided one 
while making his ﬁ  rst start for the Gators.
With a 26-game winning 
streak against Kentucky on the line, the redshirt junior quarter-back completed 15 of 18 passes for 156 yards. He added one pass-ing touchdown and one rushing touchdown en route to Florida’s 24-7 win on Saturday night at Commonwealth Stadium.
The victory helped UF (3-1, 2-0 
Southeastern Conference) move past the season-ending injuries to starters Jeff Driskel (fractured right ﬁ  bula) and Dominique Ea-sley (right ACL tear) — for the moment.
“When you go through Jeff’s 
situation and then Dominique’s situation on Tuesday night, they are very frustrating, but you can’t always control your circumstanc-es in life. You can control your vision,” coach Will Muschamp said. 
“I told our players, ‘No ex-
cuses and no regrets.’ That’s just who we are. We have an expecta-tion level here at the University of Florida in what we’re going to do and where we’re headed with our program.”
That vision will include Mur-
phy for the rest of this season. Through about eight quarters of play, he has lifted UF’s expecta-tions and added a sense of new-found promise.
Murphy completed his ﬁ  rst 
13 passes and all 11 he threw in the ﬁ  rst half. Coupled with a breakout performance by sopho-more running back Matt Jones, the Gators quelled any pregame optimism the Wildcats (1-3, 0-1 SEC) had against their depleted opponent.
Jones carried the ball 28 times 
for a career-high 176 yards and a touchdown. His biggest burst was a 67-yard scamper in the sec-ond quarter. NO EXCUSES

UF will house the country’s ﬁ  rst fully on-
line, public four-year bachelor’s degree pro-
gram after the Board of Governors passed its business plan Friday.
UF Online plans to have about 24,000 stu-
dents by its 10th year — only 57 percent of them in-state students. The program will op-erate at a loss for the ﬁ  rst four years, but the cumulative fund balance at the end of the 10 years should be more than $43.5 million, ac-cording to the business plan. 
It also laid out speciﬁ  c dates: Nov. 1 is the 
deadline for applications, and decisions will come out Dec. 1. Classes start Jan. 6.
Joe Glover, provost and senior vice presi-
dent for academic affairs, said the program’s goal is to create more access for people who might not be able to come to UF and spend four years as a resident.
Glover said there are currently seven de-grees ready for launch, with an increase of ﬁ  ve offered majors on a yearly basis for the next six or seven years.
According to the plan, those programs 
will have to either be among the state’s top 15 employment demand groups or among the top 15 most demanded at UF.
Glover said the standards for admission 
and coursework will be the same for both on-line and traditional students.
“UF will not compromise on the rigor of 
its online programs,” he said. “We will only accept students who can accomplish and beneﬁ  t from its programs.”
He said current online students are invited 
to walk at graduation, but the logistics for UF Online’s graduation are still being decided.
Glover said students will already realize 
huge savings, as two-thirds of student costs are from living at the university. Savings will also come from not having to build class-Board OKs plans for UF Online
� THE COMPANY SAID BACON 
DIDN’T ADD MUCH TO FLAVOR.

Gainesville Chipotle locations re-
cently started offering newly bacon-free 
pinto beans.
It’s part of a national rollout of the 
new vegetarian-friendly option, said Chris Arnold, a Chipotle spokesman. The beans should be offered nationwide in a few months.
During recipe tests, Chipotle decided 
the bacon didn’t add much to the ﬂ  avor.
“By taking it out, we weren’t compro-
mising anything, and we were making it more accessible to vegan and vegetarian customers as well,” Arnold said.UF students like Leigh Markowitz, 
a 19-year-old English sophomore and a vegan for about three years, said the change wasn’t a “revelation” for vegans.
“I never understood why they needed 
to have it with bacon in the ﬁ  rst place,” she said. “So when I found out they no longer did, it just seemed like they were doing the common-sense thing.”
Markowitz, a lifelong vegetarian, said 
beans are an important source of protein for everyone who lives meat free. She said this additional option will make it “more comfortable” for vegans to dine out.
“It’s usually very difﬁ  cult to go out 
with your friends,” she said. “But now that they have this central food item available for vegans, it just makes it much easier to eat out.”Chipotle offers vegan beans

rooms to accommodate the 
additional students.
Andy McCollough, associ-
ate provost for teaching and technology, said there are cur-rently 24 courses in produc-tion, and by January, there will be 42 available.
“The challenge has been not 
getting courses up but how to get courses with emphasis on face-to-face like laboratories,” he said.
Glover said one of the pos-
sible solutions is the creation of “Gator dens,” where groups of students in other areas can gather to study, interact and watch the football games.
Services such as ProctorU, which allows a third party to monitor students’ screens, are being considered for proctor-ing solutions, Glover said.
According to the UF On-
line business plan, expected revenue from the program in 10 years is $76,621,846. 
Glover said that half of the 
profits will go back into the program, with the other half being spent on supporting university research.
Betty Phillips, the new ex-
ecutive director of UF Online, wrote in an email she’s eager to get into the details of imple-menting the program.
“It is an interesting chal-
lenge to replicate all aspects of face-to-face teaching online,” she said.4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2013

While the Gators were busy taking 
care of business in Kentucky this week-
end, another group gathered to play a different kind of football in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. But in this game, the challenge was staying balanced on a single wheel.
The Gainesville Unicycle Unit, a 
branch of the Objects in Motion jug-gling club, hosted the second annual Gainesville Unicycle Fest on Friday and Saturday. Events included races, hockey, limbo, sumo wrestling, jousting and uni-bash, a cross between football and tag.
First and second place competitors 
received dollar store prizes for their suc-
cess — a toy car for the fast race, a plastic 
chest plate for jousting and a Ninja Tur-
tle towelette for the slow race.
“We had been to festivals in Atlanta 
and Tallahassee, and we were inspired to make our own,” said Shannon Craw-ford, a 22-year-old political science se-nior who served as the main organizer and the unicycle club’s spokeswoman.Crawford has been an avid unicyclist 
since receiving one eight years ago.
“Our ultimate goal is to have a really 
big festival where everyone from the southeast U.S. comes,” she said.
The club hosted about 25 cyclists and 
some spectators who wanted to try uni-cycling and juggling. Though most of the cyclists in the club were current UF students or UF graduates, unicyclists came from Orlando and Tallahassee to compete as well. Most spectators were friends and family.
“No one unicycles in Orlando. I like 
the whole group,” said Mikhel Barkan, a 28-year-old University of Central Flor-ida alumnus who drove up to attend the festival. “You’re not just riding by your-self. You’re with a group of friends, and that’s more fun.”
Arielle Walsh, a 21-year-old UF an-
thropology junior, said she was happy just watching.
“I don’t even like sports,” Walsh said. 
“But here I am, watching hockey and loving it.”
PJ Arroyo, a 24-year-old UF alum-
nus, believes anyone can learn to ride a unicycle.
“We love teaching new unicyclists,” 
said Arroyo. “Anyone can learn through sheer willpower, enough practice and enough falling off.”Gainesville Unicycle Fest celebrates one-wheel wonders

A Gainesville man arrested on an ag-
gravated child abuse charge was found 
unconscious in his Alachua County Jail cell Saturday night after trying to hang himself with a bedsheet. 
Austin Piper Dionne, 22, was rushed to 
UF Health Shands Hospital after Alachua County jail officials found him at about 9:45 p.m., said Alachua County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Art Forgey.
Dionne was arrested Friday afternoon 
after an investigation alleged he shook a 3-week-old child several times Sept. 19 when he became upset playing Xbox, ac-cording to a sheriff’s office arrest report.On that afternoon, Dionne’s wife went 
to work and left Dionne at home with the child and a 10-month-old sibling.
At about 9 p.m., Dionne called his wife 
and told her something had happened to the baby. Dionne’s wife told him to hang up and call 911.
Dionne called and told dispatch the 
baby had fallen out of a rocking chair. An ambulance arrived at the house, located in the 1900 block of Southwest 69th Drive, and drove the baby to Shands, according to the report.
A report was later submitted to the 
Child Protection Team because Dionne’s story wasn’t consistent with the baby’s in-juries.
The following day, deputies arrived at the hospital to investi-gate, according to the re-port. The baby was in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit with severe injuries, including bleeding to the 
brain, and had a hand-print on his side.
At the hospital, Dionne 
told investigators he accidentally kicked over a chair while trying to push away a cat nipping at the baby’s feet. The chair fell on the baby, and Dionne said he shook the child to keep him from losing conscious-ness, according to the report.  
Investigators met with Dionne on Fri-
day for a follow-up interview at the sher-iff’s office. Dionne admitted to hurting the child and lying about his previous stories.
Dionne told police he became frustrated 
with the baby’s crying while playing Xbox. He kicked the child’s seat, and the baby started crying more, according to the re-port. Dionne then said he flipped the chair over, causing the child to fall on his head and the chair to fall on top of the child.     
Dionne said he started shaking the 
child to keep him conscious, according to the report.
Deputies arrested him on a charge of 
aggravated child abuse. He was booked into jail with a $1 million bond.
Forgey said Dionne’s condition at 
Shands is undetermined. He added that the investigation surrounding the hanging is ongoing.

Joe Gazzam, now a screenwriter 
and soon-to-be novelist, used to  
work at Sears.  
“I just remember having this 
epiphany where I just didn’t know really what I wanted to do with my life,” Gazzam said. “I ended up at Sears, and there was this one day where my district manager came in there, and he was screaming at me for not arranging the under-wear rack properly. I was thinking, ‘What am I doing?’”
Gazzam wrote his first script in 
the department store, hiding be-hind a briefcase.
Now the Fort Lauderdale native 
and UF alumnus is releasing his first book, titled “Uncaged,” on Oct. 22. The story follows the tale of Ja-son, who is placed in Blackenbush Penitentiary, which is eventually overrun by prisoners.
Gazzam, who graduated from 
UF in 1991 with a degree in ac-counting, has lived in Los Angeles working as a screenplay writer for more than 10 years.
His work includes “21 Jump 
Street,” “Step Up Revolution” and Disney’s “Hawaiian Adventure.”    
“The one thing Hollywood says 
is ‘If you don’t want a bunch of notes, you should write a novel.’ So, they hang it over your head think-ing you’re never going to do it, but I was like ‘All right, I can write a novel.’”
Gazzam said the allure of writ-
ing without the fear of having the product heavily edited was one of the main reasons he decided to write “Uncaged.”
The 45-year-old is having “Un-
caged” published through ZOVA Books and plans on going on a book tour after the novel is released.
By going through ZOVA, he 
gets a 50 percent cut of the profits, instead of 6 percent with a larger company like the Penguin Group, Gazzam said.
Gazzam may be helped by his 
alma mater, as the UF Bookstore favors having UF authors on the shelves and encourages book sign-ings, said Lynne Vaughan, the di-rector of the bookstore.
“We would love to have as 
many (UF graduates’ books) as we can get,” Vaughan said.  “We want those books in here. And when we know they’ve written one, we try to get it in.”

“I don’t want people in jour-

The scien-tists in question were contesting the new journalism building in the works to be built near Flori-da Gym. Apparently, construc-tion would throw off the results of their running experiments.
Sept. 29, 1988The agricultural plots by 
Lake Alice lost their straw watchdog, Mop Top Moore. The 6-year-old scarecrow was last seen wearing an orange Gator poncho, holding a ﬂ  ag in her left hand and a pinwheel in her right. Grace Murphy Moore, the wife of the beloved scarecrow’s creator, pleaded for Mop Top to be returned, and she promised the thief wouldn’t be punished for the crime. “The crows miss her.”Sept. 29, 1998Trader’s Gatorland won its 
battle against City Commission and was able to keep dancing the night away — butt-naked. The 13th Street business con-tested a 3-year-old law that would have prevented it from serving alcohol and allowing nude dancing. The commission vote was split 3-2 to exempt the 25-year-old bar from the ordi-nance for the next seven and a half years.

A new addition to the food truck scene made tails wag 
at High Dive on Saturday. Earth Pets Treat Truck, which caters speciﬁ  cally to canine companions, made its High Dive rally debut alongside other vendors.
Kat Drawdy, the truck’s owner, originally decided she 
wanted to sell treats out of her car at a duck pond where many locals often walk their dogs, and the idea grew into the food truck. Drawdy said the truck’s best-selling item is the Bacon Peanut Barker frozen yogurt from The Bear & The Rat, a Denver-based small business.
Another popular treat is Bowser Beer, a nonalcoholic 
drink for dogs that comes in ﬂ  avors such as Cock-a-Doo-dle Brew and Beefy Brown Ale. Customers often pair the beer with peanut butter pretzels, she said.
Ashley Gallagher, a Gainesville woman, ordered a pint 
of frozen yogurt for her boxer, Lexi, and Staffordshire ter-rier, Buddy.
Now that she knows about the Treat Truck, Gallagher 
said she would be more inclined to go to future food truck rallies if she knows it will be there.
“It seems pretty reasonably priced,” she said.Food truck rally caters to different breed

The Southeast Center for Inte-
grated Metabolomics at UF was re-
cently awarded a ﬁ  ve-year, $9 million grant from the National Institutes of Health. Metabolomics is the study of small molecules, called metabolites, that are a byproduct of the metabolic process. They help sustain life by con-verting energy from food.
Arthur Edison, UF professor of 
biochemistry and molecular biology and director of the center, said every living organism has metabolites.
“The main reason why UF was 
picked for this is because we have a lot of expertise in the methodology, the instruments and the techniques of developing new ways to understand metabolites,” said Richard Yost, pro-fessor of chemistry and co-director of the center.
One of the studies the center is 
working on now is using metabolites to discern the differences in cells of people with muscular dystrophy and healthy people.
“You really need to look at the 
small molecules — the tools of the cell — to really understand how or-ganisms work,” Yost said.Grant gives UF center funds to study lifeReader response

HIV down, 
spending on meds up
Good news, folks! We have news that will cheer you up, 
even in the midst of an impending government shut-down. We’ll make a bold claim and say this news is 
even more heartwarming and inspiring than the bunny that adopted a group of piglets.
According to CBS News, UNAID released a report earlier 
this week about global rates of HIV. The rate of new HIV in-fections decreased by 33 percent between 2001 and 2012. The most major progress has been in stopping the spread of the HIV virus to children — since 2001, there’s been a 52 percent decrease in new infections among children. This signiﬁ  cant de-crease has been credited to the fact that more pregnant women with HIV, especially women with low incomes, were provided with antiretroviral drugs. These drugs prevent the HIV virus from progressing into AIDS, and they prevent the transmission of HIV from the mother to the unborn child.
Along with increased resources for pregnant women with 
HIV, a number of factors may have contributed to this drop in infection rates.
The CBS report stated that the World Health Organization 
has promoted earlier treatment of HIV to delay — and stop — the progression of HIV into AIDS. In addition, the WHO has supported the use of safer, simpler medications to help those with HIV live longer, healthier lives.
In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ap-
proved a drug that would help prevent the spread of HIV among users of injectable drugs such as heroin and metham-phetamine. According to another CBS report, U.S. ofﬁ  cials are encouraging doctors to prescribe the daily AIDS medication to injectable drug users, heterosexual couples with HIV infections and high-risk gay men.
In 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
launched the Act Against AIDS, an initiative aimed to educate Americans about the risk of AIDS and combat complacency about the spread of HIV. The campaign targeted the hardest-hit populations: gay and bisexual men, African-Americans and Latinos. The campaign is in alignment with the National AIDS/HIV Strategy, which was launched in 2010.
Thirty years ago, we wouldn’t be having this national dis-
cussion about the dangers of AIDS. Those affected in the 1980s, especially gay men in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, had little resources and dealt with isolation, fear and the crippling side effects of the disease — most notably, severe im-mune deﬁ  ciency.
Fast forward to now, where conﬁ  dential HIV testing is avail-
able at many places in America — including UF, where testing comes at no cost to students through GatorWell. Government spending in the area of AIDS education and prevention and the work of activists such as writer Edmund White have pro-duced a positive, tangible change over the past decade.
“Now, I think there’s every reason to be hopeful. It really 
is more like a disease like diabetes,” White told CNN in 2011. “There are a lot of inconveniences, but you can go on living. And I would say AIDS is about like that now.”
Reality redneck TV is not representative  
Attention TV fanatics of America: the Kardashians 
have been ofﬁ  cially dethroned by a new family of reality royals. The fellas of “Duck Dynasty” 
made history in August when their season 4 premiere became the most-watched reality telecast of all time. They had 11.8 million viewers, topping even the popular competition show “America’s Got Talent.”
A real-life version of “The Beverly Hillbillies,” “Duck 
Dynasty” is one of the latest installments in a new strain of 
reality shows starring America’s blue-collar population. In this particular show, a family makes its fortune selling duck calls, and they combine new money with their old-Southern lifestyle.
Producers are strutting out regular Joes from across 
the South in shows like “Welcome to Myrtle Manor,” 
“Redneck Island,” “American Hoggers,” “Swamp Peo-ple” and MTV’s “Big Tips Texas” and “Buckwild.” Ac-cidental child star Alana Thompson and the family of “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo” have become famous for nothing more than eating “sketti” topped with butter and ketchup while spewing phrases like, “You better redneckognize.”
The excessive coverage of redneck culture is promot-
ing a misunderstanding of life in the South by capitaliz-ing on the hillbilly stereotype and glossing over the rest. These shows are no different than “Jersey Shore,” which depicted a subculture as the norm. They’re problematic in that they perpetuate detrimental stereotypes — and even create new ones. Unfortunately, those negative im-ages don’t affect just one state, but everyone below the Mason-Dixon line.
U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) issued a statement 
to MTV asking that they cancel “Buckwild” to avoid misrepresenting the state’s youth based on “ugly, inac-curate stereotypes“ about the people of West Virginia.
Hollywood has done a ﬁ  ne job disparaging the South 
in the past, painting its inhabitants as inbred, incestuous and downright stupid. So why turn them into a collective cash cow after all this time?
The obsession with these 
series is likely a result of the economy. Americans are tired of watching the rich folk spend egregious amounts of money and live in a consequence-free fantasy land. Maybe we like the redneck shows because they’re about families, many of which 
are simply trying to get by. These are two ends of a spec-trum, and whether we want to accept it, it’s hard to ig-nore which end we’re closer to.
Now that these countriﬁ  ed families have a well-es-
tablished market, the number of redneck reality shows is skyrocketing, each a little more contrived than the last.
Even America’s beloved “Duck Dynasty” now thrives 
by selling its back-country charm in the form of shirts, audiobooks and even children’s toys. These guys would have never opened their own Twitter accounts, but they have those and more, including regular Google Hang-outs and a “Beard Yourself” app for smartphones.
If the authenticity and relatability of these people 
were the original draws, the rise in corporate involve-ment could lessen the charm of the shows.
Like any trend in the realm of television, this too shall 
pass. Rednecks, although various and comically multi-faceted, will eventually be replaced by another subcul-ture. America loves its niche dwellers — the ones as in-triguing and horrifying to watch as the proverbial car crash.
Until then, remember that Alana “Honey Boo Boo” 
Thompson is to the South what Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi is to New Jersey — a caricature, a stereotype and a non sequitur in the context of the real people around whom she lives.

opinions@alligator.org MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2013  ALLIGATOR, 7
Once, I was an uninformed 
student. 
When I came to UF in 
the Fall of 2011, I had no idea what Student Government did, much less the Senate.  
Someone I went to high school 
with told me to get involved and to join the Students Party.
I thought I was serving the 
Student Body, but once I became a senator, I realized that — unlike what I was initially led to believe — the differences between the Swamp Party and the Students Party were not ones of integrity or ideals. 
The key differences between 
the Swamp Party and the Students Party were the levels of dedication, hard work and commitment to serving the Student Body. 
Halfway through my term, it 
dawned on me that the Swamp Party was the party of results and the party that had a vision for a better tomorrow.
When I worked to improve 
bus service on the weekend for my constituents who live south of Archer Road in District D, members of the Swamp Party were the ones who assisted me every step of the way.  
Despite the fact that I was a 
Students Party senator, leaders in the Swamp Party gave me direction, guidance and a helping hand.
In my time as a senator, both as 
a member of the Students Party in the past and currently as a member of the Swamp Party, I have seen what the Swamp Party is capable of doing. 
The Swamp Party candidates 
are truly the most qualiﬁ  ed individuals to represent the 50,000 students of the Gator Nation because the Swamp Party always ensures the students’ needs are met and their voices are heard.
I fully support, endorse and 
trust in the Swamp Party because the members of the Swamp Party are the most qualiﬁ  ed to represent us. 
I joined the Swamp Party 
because it exempliﬁ  es and embodies the ideals of UF, and it makes the students a priority. 
Today and always, I throw my 
full support behind the Swamp Party.
I hope all of you do the same.TK Yang is a District D senator 
up for re-election.
I support the Swamp Party: Here’s whyGuest columnDespite dozens of attempts to re-peal it, key provisions of the Af-fordable Care Act — commonly 
known as Obamacare — go into effect Tuesday.
Open enrollment in state health insur-
ance exchanges runs until March 31, 2014. 
If you miss the initial enrollment period, another one opens in October 2014.
Naturally, freedom is about to die.
The conservative Heritage Foundation backed a 
similar health care reform package in the 1990s, mean-ing that the Affordable Care Act is most certainly the most socialistic, communistic and anti-American piece of legislation ever passed into law.
Also, the law might actually work.Yes, Republicans across the country boldly labeled 
Obamacare a failure before key provisions were im-plemented and declared it unconstitutional even after the conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court ruled the law was acceptable.
Congress is oh so functional.Last week, I wrote about letting the GOP pass ev-
erything to prove them wrong. 
By that same token, the GOP is taking the opposite 
approach to the Affordable Care Act. 
If the law is truly an affront to democracy and free-
dom, why not let it go into law, prove it’s a failure and then try to repeal it?
Instead of spending valuable legislative time work-
ing on alternative solutions to our health care crisis, Republicans in Congress and throughout the country decided that bashing the law was a far better use of re-sources rather than actually ﬁ  guring out how to cover millions of uninsured Americans.
Despite attempts to sabotage the law, the returns are 
promising before the open enrollment period starts. 
The expected cost of insurance in several states 
— including Florida — is signiﬁ  cantly lower than ex-pected.
While Republicans continue to push the notion that 
insurance premiums will rise, we’re starting to see the opposite. 
Honestly, if you look at the facts, we shouldn’t be 
surprised.
The idea of the insurance exchanges is to pool ev-
eryone who wants insurance together, thus lowering the cost to the individual. 
It’s similar to an employer-based health insurance 
plan where your premiums cost less because your em-ployer is purchasing insurance in bulk rather than just for one person.  
If you have health insurance currently, 
nothing changes. 
If you don’t, the state of Florida has 102 
insurance plans under Obamacare, and the average premium for a 27-year-old is a mere $229 before a subsidy.
Overall, this sounds like a pretty fair 
deal, so why spend all of this time trying 
to kill a constitutional law rather than looking at the law in earnest and trying to ﬁ  x what you don’t like?
Easy. It’s all about the history books.President Barack Obama made history when the 
Democratic-led Congress passed his signature health care bill. 
Few times over the last century have presidents 
solved our health care crisis. 
In fact, it’s a battle that dates back to Theodore 
Roosevelt.  
Republicans in Congress overwhelmingly voted 
against the Affordable Care Act, and many members have spent what seems like every waking hour since that vote trying to repeal it. 
If the law is successful and millions of Americans 
suddenly have access to affordable health insurance, and we can start to end the nightmare that is our health care system, Obama wins, and Republicans lose.
Despite the Tea Party wave of 2010, Republicans 
took a beating in recent elections. 
President Obama’s resounding victories in 2008 
and 2012 helped solidify the notion that Republicans have a long way to go to stay competitive on a national level.
Convincing the American people — and them-
selves — that Obamacare truly is the root of all evil and the most un-American act in history, is the only way the GOP stays competitive in upcoming national elections.
If the Affordable Care Act is a success, coupled 
with a drastically improved economy, the Republican Party will suffer yet again in the 2016 elections, even if they put Tea Party darling Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) at the top of the ticket.
The GOP carries on the ﬁ  ght against Obamacare be-
cause they understand the consequences of succeed-ing. You may not agree with them, but they certainly aren’t stupid.

Big Tobacco wants to increase cigarette sales in Flor-
ida, and they’re looking for Gators to help them do it.
Altria Group, the parent com-
pany of Philip Morris USA and the largest cigarette manufacturer in the country, will be at the Career Re-source Center’s Career Showcase on Tuesday. The company is recruiting for a sales manager position in Florida. If you’ve seen a box of Marlboro cigarettes, you’ve seen what Altria produces.
The University of Florida promotes its tobacco-free 
policy with pride, yet Big Tobacco will be given the op-portunity to grow, to thrive, to promote the use of products that, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, kill more than 400,000 people each year.
The university prohibited tobacco use on all university-
owned property on July 1, 2010. 
For the past three years, UF has encouraged students, 
faculty and visitors to remember and remind others about the policy whenever they see cigarettes, cigars, electronic cigarettes and similar products used on campus.
UF spokesman Steve Orlando told the Gainesville Sun 
in 2010 that UF adopted the policy “to help people live healthier lifestyles.” UF is proud of its position as a tobac-co-free campus. 
But where we see pride, Altria sees an opportunity to 
build its market. Altria sees UF’s brilliant students as peo-ple who can help sell cigarettes. But let’s be clear: When Altria sells more cigarettes, more people die.
Tobacco use is the No. 1 cause of preventable death in 
the United States, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We spend more than $96 billion in health care expenditures related to tobacco-related illnesses each year. Florida alone spends more than $6 billion annually on health costs directly related to smoking, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids website.  
I’m a proud Gator, but on Oct. 1, I’ll be a devastated 
one. 
Big Tobacco will sit in the Stephen C. O’Connell Cen-
ter and recruit my peers to sell tobacco products. Neither cigarettes nor Big Tobacco’s recruiters should be allowed on campus. 
Tobacco is a legal product, but UF has made a decision 
to ban tobacco on campus. 
If we’ve banned smoking on campus, we should not 
allow the industry to come and recruit our most talented students. 
Gators should be faced with opportunities to give back 
to their communities, not given opportunities to sell prod-ucts that will kill them.

Research SG candidates and vote
Dear Gators,
As I’m sure most of you know, Fall elections start Tuesday and 
will continue through Wednesday. This semester, the Student Body will elect 50 senators who will represent the different residence halls and geographical areas surrounding campus.
Student Government elections allow students to voice their con-
cerns through the power of voting. I value and understand the im-portance of these elections.
I encourage all of you to research the candidates and parties on 
the ballot. I will vote ﬁ  rst thing tomorrow morning and hope that the entire Student Body will join me in honoring the democratic representation that we enjoy here at UF.
Go Gators!

At an event where students were encour-
aged to let go of their secrets, many walked 
home with their baggage still floating over their heads.
Whisper, an app which allows users to 
anonymously share their deepest secrets, planned to host a balloon release Friday at the Let Go With Whisper event on Turlington Plaza.
But with environmental activists protest-
ing the release of the balloons into the atmo-sphere, students brought their purple balloons with secrets inside home instead.
Some  “whispers” on the app range from  “I 
have a crush on my fraternity brother” to “My friends and I take real estate signs at night and put them on other houses.”
Whisper is a “raw view into what really 
goes on on campus,” said Michelle George, a 21-year-old public relations senior and creator of the event.
“It makes people feel as though they’re not 
alone,” George said.The purple balloons symbolized a message 
in a bottle, she said.
Whisper is a free iOS and Android app. 
The app allows users to scroll through other people’s anonymous whispers and sends us-ers notifications when someone nearby shares a secret.
George is one of five Whisper campus rep-
resentatives at UF. The app has representa-tives at 30 schools across the country and is one of the fastest-growing apps, she said.
George said when she heard about the op-
portunity to work with Whisper, she jumped at the chance.
“The app, in general, helps people,” she 
said. “It keeps people connected.”
Kateria Wynn, a 20-year-old advertising ju-
nior and Whisper campus representative, said the app helps people express themselves.
The booth attracted 60 people in the first 
two hours, Wynn said.
Upon seeing the booth, Genevieve Hyppo-
lite, a 19-year-old microbiology sophomore, said, “Oh, Whisper! I love that!”
She said she likes the app because it is fun-
ny, and “people can get stuff off their chests.”
She has been using Whisper since the Fall 
of 2012.
Although the balloons were not released, 
Hyppolite said she “still felt good writing it down.”Students can’t escape secrets

Despite doubling its hours from 
20 to 40 a week, students are still 
having difficulty getting an ap-pointment at the sexually trans-mitted infection clinic.
Each week, 60 slots are avail-
able to students. Since the center’s opening in Fall 2012, the slots have been completely booked every week, said Rosemary Dougherty, health educator for the Alachua County Health Department.
Provided by the Alachua Coun-
ty Health Department, a satellite clinic in the Student Health Care Center at UF offers free-of-charge STD tests to students that will stay off their UF records and away from their parents’ mailboxes.
“We kind of worked around the 
main problem the school brought to our attention of students not wanting to get tested because it was expensive, and their parents would find out about it,” Dough-erty said.
Dougherty explained that this 
is a non-university-affiliated clinic hosted by the health department on campus. The clinic has a sepa-rate system from UF, so neither has access to each other’s records.
“It was three years ago when 
everything changed for us,” said Phylis Craig, associate director of nursing at the Student Health Care Center. “STD-testing prices went sky-high when we were put un-der the umbrella of the College of Medicine and had to apply all their pricing, which were outside clinic charges.”
Craig said they wanted a more 
economic way for students to get tested.
Currently, Alachua County ranks fourth highest in the state for STDs, Craig said.
“We see asymptomatic students 
at the clinic. Many students tell us they heard about the clinic from a friend who tested positive with no symptoms,” Dougherty said.
Alexandra Stephan, an 18-year-
old health science freshmen, said she didn’t know about the clinic until recently.
“The fact that testing is not only 
free but also confidential makes it a hundred times more appealing for any student,” she said.

Breaking Bridge
The northbound lanes of the 2100 block of Southwest 13th Street were closed Sunday night after the DNA bridge knocked a trailer off a tow truck near Archer Road, as seen in this 
stitched photo. The trailer had been damaged in a previous accident, said Sgt. Barry Kays of Gainesville Police. The Florida Department of Transportation deemed the bridge safe.

A new neon green bike light 
produced by a British student 
hasn’t hit the marketplace yet, but some locals anticipate it could make night riding safer. Others are not convinced.
A British product design student  
invented the light, called Blaze. It emits a neon-green laser image onto the street 16 feet in front of the bicycle to help protect night bike riders, according to a CNN story.
But John Savona, a UPD bicycle 
unit officer, said the bright green light concerns him because it is not what people on the road are used to seeing.
“I’m not really convinced,” he said. 
“It looks like a huge distraction.”
The item has not yet been released, 
and no prices are listed yet on the product’s website, blaze.cc.
UF bicyclists are required by law to ride with a headlight and a taillight at night.
Fred Lintz, Gator Cycle manager, 
said that headlights and taillights are really what riders need to stay safe and visible while riding at night.
“A lot of people try to pass by the 
legal minimum and don’t understand how important it is to let people know you’re coming,” he said.
Emily VanGelder, a member of 
Team Florida Cycling, said the Blaze light could make night rides safer.
“I don’t think headlights and 
taillights are effective enough,” said VanGelder, a 20-year-old UF applied physiology and kinesiology sophomore. “I think it would improve visibility a lot.”
She said the neon green color is 
the best part of the light because it would not blend in with car lights on the road.
VanGelder said the Blaze light 
could help, but it doesn’t mean night riding shouldn’t be taken seriously.  
“I’m just extra cautious because 
I know a lot of the drivers aren’t looking out for me,” she said, “so I have to look out for myself.”Bike light might help ridersBUY IT. SELL IT. FIND IT. 373-FIND

Gators in the polls
Florida moved up two spots to No. 18 in the Associated 
Press Poll after a 24-7 victory against Kentucky on Saturday. UF is No. 19 in the USA Today Coaches’ Poll.JOE MORGAN
Alligator Staff Writer @joe_morgan
Coach Will Muschamp called 
Matt Jones into his ofﬁ  ce on Mon-
day.
Since returning from a viral 
infection that sidelined him for more than a month, Jones was timid. 
He fumbled twice and tal-
lied only 96 yards on 30 carries through two games.
Muschamp wanted his bruis-
ing runner back.
“You need to cut it loose and 
play,” Muschamp told Jones. “You’re very tentative when you run it. You look like last year at the beginning of the year. If you make a mistake, hell, put it on me. I don’t care. Everybody else does.
“Just run the ball hard. Cut it 
loose and go play.”
Florida always needed Jones 
to produce, but Saturday’s game took on extra meaning after a rough week in Gainesville. 
Quarterback Jeff Driskel and 
defensive tackle Dominique Eas-ley both suffered season-ending injuries.
But after losing two key play-
makers in four days, Florida got one back in a 24-7 win against Kentucky on Saturday night in Commonwealth Stadium. 
Jones was a workhorse for the 
Gators, carrying 28 times for a ca-reer-high 176 yards and a touch-down.
He described his stellar per-
formance as “a relief.”
“That’s what I grind for all 
offseason,” Jones said. “Deﬁ  nite-ly missing the camp took me off track. This is what I was really grinding for — games like this to come back to me.”
The sophomore’s longest touch 
was a 67-yard run during the sec-ond quarter that set up Florida’s go-ahead touchdown. 
Jones might have found the 
end zone himself had wideout Quinton Dunbar not accidentally tripped him from behind. 
The tailback wanted to cut 
back and change direction, but Dunbar simply got in the way while trying to throw a block.
Still, the play brought a smile 
to Jones’ face. Before eating up two thirds of the gridiron on his seventh carry, the Seffner native’s ﬁ  rst six only went for 12 yards.
“It was deﬁ  nitely a big weight 
off my shoulders because I had so much pressure on me,” Jones said of his career-long run.
The big play marked a turning 
point for Jones, who racked up 97 yards on his ﬁ  nal 21 rushing at-tempts against the Wildcats. 
He carried the ball 18 times in 
the second half.With the Gators ahead com-
fortably and aiming to milk the clock, Jones delivered.
“My mentality was great at the 
end of the game,” Jones said. “I knew I was going to get the 
ball mostly every play, but I ran hard knowing I needed to get the ﬁ  rst down every couple of plays.”Teammates were happy to see 
Jones get back on track. 
Wide receiver Trey Burton 
said Jones looked “100 percent”

Matt Jones runs down the ﬁ  eld during Florida’s 24-7 victory against Kentucky on Saturday at Common-
wealth Stadium in Lexington, Ky. The sophomore running back carried the ball 28 times for a career-high 176 yards and a touchdown in the win after struggling during his ﬁ  rst two games this season.

Alligator Staff Writer @alichtenstein24
LEXINGTON, Ky. — With senior 
defensive tackle Dominique Easley out 
for the season with a torn ACL and me-dial meniscus, Florida’s defense needed someone to step up to lead the unit.
Dante Fowler Jr. did just that.The sophomore Buck linebacker re-
corded two sacks on a single drive late in the fourth quarter to seal the game as No. 20 Florida defeated Kentucky 24-7 at Commonwealth Stadium.
“Seeing [Easley] go down and 
stuff like that,” Fowler said, “it kind of sucked.
“We just played mad. We just played for him.”
Fowler and his teammates on the de-
fensive line had no problem ﬁ  lling in for the injured senior on Saturday.
Fowler, safety Cody Riggs and defen-
sive linemen Jonathan Bullard and Bry-an Cox Jr. combined for ﬁ  ve sacks — one more than Florida had through its ﬁ  rst three games.
“Collectively, as a unit, those guys 
are capable of playing very well,” coach Will Muschamp said. “That’s what we expect.”
Bullard and Fowler — who racked 
up three and a half sacks on Saturday — were both especially impressive.Fowler ﬁ  lls void for Gators
SEE NOTES, PAGE 13PHILIBUSTER
LEXINGTON, Ky. — The kid 
needs to play.
When starter Marcus 
Roberson went down with a knee injury against Miami — he did not play against Tennessee or Kentucky — No. 20 Florida turned to highly touted freshman Vernon Hargreaves III to ﬁ  ll the void. 
Hargreaves has done more than that.  He 
has become the Gators’ best cornerback.
Hargreaves, who headlined UF’s im-
pressive Class of 2013, has three intercep-tions in his ﬁ  rst four games. Although each forced turnover has been the product of in-telligence and world-class athleticism, his game-sealing interception to secure Flori-da’s 24-7 victory against Kentucky on Sat-urday in Commonwealth Stadium was his most impressive feat thus far. 
With the Wildcats driving 
late in the third quarter of what was then only a two-score game, quarterback Maxwell Smith reached back and sent a pass deep into the end zone intended for receiver Javess Blue.
He instead found Hargreaves, 
who made an acrobatic effort to secure the pass, tap his toes in the corner of the end zone and hold onto the ball as his momen-tum carried him out of bounds.
Ballgame. “He’s a ball-hawk,” said a relieved coach 
Will Muschamp, whose team experienced the lows of losing two of its most important players in the span of four days last week.
“He gets the ball off people. He has a Hargreaves best UF cornerback

“We got high expectation levels 
for those guys,” Muschamp said. “They do for themselves … They needed to play that way.”
Bullard was previously playing 
defensive end, but he moved in-side to defensive tackle to replace Easley. The results were as good as Muschamp could have expected.
The sophomore recorded three 
tackles and 1.5 sacks for a loss of 9 yards.
“Jon’s 285 (pounds),” Mus-
champ said. “He can hold the point. He can rush inside. He’s a very good athlete and a matchup on most of the guys we are going to play.”
Freshman makes first catch: 
Freshman wide receiver Demarcus Robinson made the first catch of his career against Kentucky (1-3, 0-1 SEC) on Saturday.
The Fort Valley, Ga., native 
played in the Gators’ first two games of the season without mak-ing a reception, but he was sus-pended for Florida’s game against Tennessee on Sept. 21 for a viola-tion of team rules.Coaches praised Robinson for 
his athleticism and playmaking ability during UF’s fall camp, and the freshman made an impression on fans with notable catches dur-ing Florida’s open practices.
Offensive coordinator Brent 
Pease said before the Gators played the Volunteers that Robinson was “going to pop,” but it took nearly a month for the freshman to make his first catch.
Wide receiver Trey Burton said 
he was surprised it took Robinson this long to make his first reception because the freshman is one of the most athletic players Burton has ever played with.
“I remember my first catch 
when I was a freshman,” Burton said. “So (I am) just excited for him in the future.”
Injured Gators: Florida had 
several players who were poised to return from nagging injuries on Saturday, but not all of them did.
Defensive back Marcus 
Roberson (knee) warmed up with the team but did not dress for the game. 
Muschamp said Roberson was 
a game-time decision, and he was not comfortable playing the junior with the injury he suffered against Miami on Sept. 7.
However, right tackle Tyler 
Moore (ankle) did get back into ac-tion on Saturday. 
The redshirt sophomore came 
in after several Florida drives and replaced redshirt senior Kyle Koehne, a guard who was filling in on the edge.
Defensive lineman Leon Orr (shoulder) also returned to the Gators’ rotation. Muschamp said Orr had trouble in practice but was able to play 15-18 snaps.“We felt like we weren’t play-
ing many snaps defensively,” Muschamp said. “Got off the field pretty much after the first drive.”
Saturday night.
“I’m excited for the future,” Burton 
said. “He’s an unbelievable running back 
and just excited to see what he has in the future.”
Tyler Murphy, who made his first ca-
reer start on Saturday, was also happy to see Jones in top form. The redshirt junior signal-caller said Jones makes his life eas-ier under center.
“They’re always up in the box playing 
for the run,” Murphy said. “It just creates some holes down the field for you to nick-el and dime them and keep the offense moving.”
Jones was not ready to return when 
he took his first snap on Sept. 7 in Miami Gardens. 
However, three weeks later, he appears 
to be in midseason form.
“Physically, I wasn’t really ready, but 
my mind was telling me, ‘You ready,’” Jones said. 
“I just kept telling myself that, but I 
think I’m really getting better. I’m at my peak right now.”
Alligator Staff Writers Phil Heilman and 
Adam Pincus contributed to this report.knack for going and getting 
it. He has tremendous leap-ing ability. He’s probably got a 37- or 38-inch vertical. He’s got really good ball skills down the field. He judges the ball extremely well. He’s got good body position on receiv-ers. He’s a very good football player.”
Muschamp’s laundry list 
of accolades for Hargreaves is exactly why he should be on the field as much as possi-ble — not just when a veteran from Florida’s secondary is banged up. 
Through four games, 
Hargreaves has shown bet-ter instincts in coverage than Loucheiz Purifoy has at any time during his UF career. And many pro scouts con-sider Purifoy a first-round talent. 
Hargreaves has been 
more impressive than even Roberson, UF’s other lock-down cornerback. When Roberson was healthy against Toledo, he seemed to be loaf-ing on several plays, relying on superior athleticism in-stead of sound technique.
It may seem blasphemous 
and even shortsighted to anoint Hargreaves the team’s best cornerback after only four games. But if you watch what he does on a play-to-play basis, not just when he is flying through the air to inter-cept passes, it becomes clear that is the case. 
Hargeaves is rarely out of 
position. The only thing sur-passing his physical genius is his mental acumen. His abili-ty to read and diagnose offen-sive formations leaves him in perfect position to constantly be around the ball, whether it be batting down passes, mak-ing tackles or creating game-changing turnovers. 
“He’s just a ball-hawk 
player,” Buck linebacker Dante Fowler Jr. said. 
“That’s all I have to say for 
Vernon. 
“When he caught the ball, 
I saw it, and I saw how high he got. All I said was, ‘Wow,’ and I just walked off to the sideline. That’s crazy. He’s going to be a very good play-er.”
Hargreaves is already 
more than just a very good player.

da’s defense has to offer. MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 30, 2013 § ALLIGATOR, 13

The Gators’ winning streak versus the Wildcats dates back to 1986 and is the longest active streak in the Southeastern Conference.Jones also helped Murphy set-
tle down in front of an announced 
crowd of 62,076. 
Murphy engineered a 13-play, 
93-yard scoring drive on the Gators’ ﬁ  rst possession that end-ed with a 2-yard touchdown run by Jones. The march down the ﬁ  eld took 7:47 off the clock. 
“You can’t ask for a better 
start,” Murphy said. “That’s deﬁ  -nitely a heartbreaker for the de-fense to start the game.”
Kentucky could only muster 
seven points during the home-coming of its former head coach, Joker Phillips, and offensive co-ordinator, Brent Pease. 
Facing a 42-yard ﬁ  eld goal at-
tempt, Kentucky dialed up a fake with holder Jared Leet ﬂ  ipping the snap over his head to kicker Joe Mansour, who outran Ronald Powell and Loucheiz Purifoy for a 25-yard touchdown. 
The fake ﬁ  eld goal was the 
lone blemish for the Gators, whose second-ranked defense forced three punts and a turnover on downs following the fake. 
Kentucky managed only 173 
total yards of offense compared to Florida’s 402 yards in the game. 
The Wildcats’ quarterback 
combo of Jalen Whitlow and Max-well Smith passed for 125 yards — the lowest output allowed by the Gators this season. 
Buck linebacker Dante Fowler 
Jr. registered two sacks in Flori-da’s ﬁ  rst game without Easley manning the middle.
Florida scored touchdowns on 
its next two possessions to head into the locker room with a 21-7 halftime lead. Murphy ran one score in from 5 yards out on a read option and found receiver Trey Burton on a 9-yard pass for another.
Burton has become a favorite 
in the slot among Florida’s quar-terbacks this season. 
His six catches for 66 yards led Florida in receiving for the sec-ond time this season.
Four of Burton’s receptions 
went for ﬁ  rst downs, as the Flori-da offense efﬁ  ciently picked apart  the Kentucky defense. 
Murphy looked like a sea-
soned veteran. In a way, after waiting more than three seasons for an opportunity, he is.
“I don’t think he’ll ever be in 
a tougher situation than what he was last [week] coming cold off the bench,” Burton said of Mur-phy. 
“You just really saw him grow 
up in front of your eyes. I’m just really proud of him and really ex-cited for the future.”
The future gets murky after 
Florida hosts Arkansas next Sat-urday night at 7 on ESPN2. 
Three of its next six games 
come against top-15 teams in LSU, Georgia and South Caro-lina. Besides the annual neutral-ﬁ  eld matchup against Georgia, the other two games are on the road.
But Murphy is not looking 
ahead.
“The weeks are deﬁ  nitely go-
ing to get tougher. Arkansas is a really good team,” Murphy said. “It will be nice to have them at home. We’ll have that advantage there, but it’s another SEC oppo-nent. 
“They’re really good. We’ll 
just have to watch the ﬁ  lm on Kentucky and move on and get ready for Arkansas.”
In a game where seemingly 
everything went right, Murphy had his lone mistake in the third quarter when UK linebacker Josh Forrest intercepted his 14th pass attempt and returned it 39 yards before Murphy made a touch-down-saving tackle at the UF 37-yard line.But the one thing that went 
wrong for Florida on Saturday ended up not mattering.
Freshman cornerback Vernon 
Hargreaves III intercepted a  pass by Smith that was intended for Javess Blue in the end zone on Kentucky’s following possession. 
Hargreaves’ leaping grab in-
creased his team-leading inter-ception total to three.
Kentucky came into the game 
with renewed optimism. 
After 26 years of losing, a win 
seemed within reach for new coach Mark Stoops, a former Florida State defensive coordi-nator, against a beat-up Florida team.
It became clear early on that 
this would not be the ﬁ  rst Florida team to lose to Kentucky since 1986, when Muschamp was in grade school.
The Florida coach asked more 
of his defense after a stellar per-formance against Miami. 
He brought Jones into his of-
ﬁ  ce on Monday telling the sopho-more to get it together. He thrust a veteran backup quarterback into the SEC limelight.
For the second straight week, 
the Gators were game for the challenge. 
After the game, Fowler walked 
outside of the locker room with postgame Chik-ﬁ  l-A in his right arm and a red-haired doll nestled under the other. The “Chucky” doll, which belongs to Easley, sported navy blue overalls and scars across its face.
It served as a reminder of the 
wound, still fresh, that follows Florida as it enters the remainder of its SEC schedule — one that could be a dark abyss or a ﬁ  tting ending to Murphy’s sterling de-but.
“I don’t want to hear one ex-
cuse in here about why some-thing doesn’t happen,” Mus-champ said. “We’re not going to have any excuses in here, and we’re not going to have any re-grets about the way we play.”

� UF HAD EIGHT BLOCKS IN FIRST SET.

Associate coach Dave Boos said Florida’s 
back-row defense has made up for the front 
row’s mistakes this season. But on Sunday against Ole Miss, the Gators finally deliv-ered at the net.
Behind a season-high 15 blocks, No. 3 
Florida took down Ole Miss in three sets (25-13, 25-22, 25-12) in Oxford, Miss.
The Gators, who came into the weekend 
ranked 88th in the country in stuffs per set with 2.35, quickly shut down the Rebels’ of-fensive attack by recording eight blocks in the first set alone.Coach Mary Wise said the blocking effort 
early in the match and the preparation be-fore the game allowed her squad to become more comfortable in an intimidating road environment.
“We really set the tempo of the match 
with how well we blocked in the first set,” Wise said. “You could really trace our suc-cess back to our practice on Saturday. What you can’t do is wait until match time to un-derstand how quick [the Rebels] are.”
Ole Miss middle blockers Nakeyta Clair 
and Ty Laporte earned spots on the South-eastern Conference All-Freshman team last year, and Florida blocked just four balls on Friday night during its sweep of Mississippi State. Considering the disadvantage on pa-per, UF needed its middle blockers to step up Sunday.
Chloe Mann and Simone Antwi combined 
for seven of the Gators’ 15 blocks against the Rebels, who managed only two total blocks in the match. 
Clair and Laporte, who 
combined to average just fewer than two stuffs per set last year, were held to a combined one-block performance on their own floor.
Because Florida (13-1, 
2-0 SEC) shut down Ole Miss’ (10-5, 0-2 SEC) 6-foot-
1 and 6-foot middle blockers, the Gators’ back row saw the ball better and passed more efficiently to setter Taylor Brauneis.Wise said defensive specialist Holly Pole 
had a breakout performance Sunday. Pole’s volleyball IQ helped her anticipate and pre-dict the Rebels’ play calls.
“She’s seeing the game at a different lev-
el,” Wise said. “And what I mean by that is she sees the play before is hit, and she puts herself in such great position.”
Pole, one of three junior defensive spe-
cialists for Florida, also proved that she can help score points for the Gators with her play behind the service line.
In the third set with Florida trailing 5-4, 
Pole began a service run that did not end un-til the Gators were up 10-5. UF did not give up the lead for the remainder of the match.

Although Pamela Begic tried to 
spark a rally for UF in the second 
half, Florida could not come back against Missouri.
Despite maintaining possession 
and earning seven corner kicks in the second half, the No. 7 Gators fell 1-0 to the Tigers on Sunday.
Begic tried to execute a finish for 
Florida on five of its 12 shot oppor-tunities in the second half. Of those five shots, the freshman midfielder took three using her head. 
The Gators have scored twice on headers this year.
Coach Becky Burleigh was 
pleased with the process despite the poor results.
“We did everything but the final 
goal. We did everything but execute that final shot on goal in the second half,” Burleigh said. “Soccer is a cru-el game sometimes.”
Florida (8-2-1, 2-1 Southeastern 
Conference) had two potential goals in its grasp. One was a header from Begic that hit the crossbar, and the other came from a shot by defender Lauren Silver that hit the post. 
Despite Florida’s energy in the second half, Missouri made the dif-ference early.
The Tigers’ (6-5, 2-1 SEC) first-
half pressure frazzled Florida’s back line after eight minutes. 
Mizzou midfielder Kaysie Clark 
sank a shot into the left corner of the net.  
Goalkeeper Nora Neset Gjoen 
cut to the right and exposed the left side of goal, allowing Clark to take advantage. 
The victory gives the Tigers their 
first win against a top-10 opponent since defeating No. 7 Ohio State 1-0 on Aug. 26, 2011.
“We got off to a very slow start,” 
Burleigh said. “We got behind early and probably should have been be-hind more than one early.”
After Clark’s goal, Mizzou took 
five shots — one coming from a pen-alty kick — but was held scoreless.
This season, Florida has been 
consistently stronger in the second half, outscoring opponents 14-1. But the Gators could not find the elusive goal on Sunday.
Florida’s loss is its first in con-
ference play this season. UF comes home with split results after winning 4-1 against Mississippi on Friday. 
This is the first time Florida failed 
to recover from a deficit since its 3-0 loss against Florida State on August 30.
“For us, it’s a preparation issue,” 
Burleigh said. “We knew exactly what to expect with this team, and I think we were mentally prepared to deal with it. We weren’t able to get our mind around what we had to do for probably the first 25 minutes.”
