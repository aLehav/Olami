The Alachua County Sheriff’s Ofﬁ  ce arrested three men over 
the weekend connected to a Thursday night robbery at a south-
west Gainesville apartment complex.
Police charged Benjamin Tyrell Lewis, 28, with home inva-
sion with a ﬁ  rearm, aggravated battery , grand theft, criminal 
conspiracy, possession of stolen property and marijuana pos-
session.
Ahmad Rashard Hunt, 22, and Larry Donnell Robinson, 18, 
were charged with three counts of criminal conspiracy, posses-sion of stolen property and marijuana possession.
The ASO arrest reports and a witness gave the following ac-
count:
At about 10 p.m. Thursday, two women were at the apart-
ment of Daniel Bleasdale, 20, and Peter Dayton, 19, in the Re-
ﬂ  ections Apartment complex at 205 SW 75th St.
Robinson called the group, wanting to come by in the next 
half hour and hang out.
“We didn’t think anything of it,” said one of the women, 
who asked to remain anonymous, in an interview Sunday.

� PROFITS FROM CARD SALES FUND 
IRHA PROGRAMS ALL YEAR.

You would be surprised by how far $10 
can go on campus.
This Fall, the Inter-Residence Hall Associa-
tion is making that $10 go farther.
IRHA sells business-card-sized colored 
pieces of paper, known as activity cards, 
which offer discounts off tutoring services and textbooks from 12 different residence halls on campus.
Severin Walstad, a 21-year-old public re-
lations senior and president of IRHA, said the most notable change this Fall has been a deal with the UF Bookstore in the Reitz Union where students with activity cards can buy school supplies at a 10 percent discount from the bookstore directly. 
The deal will replace a program that start-ed Summer B offering discounted school sup-plies at the IRHA ofﬁ  ce. 
IRHA usually sells about 3,000 cards in the 
ﬁ  rst week, which yields $30,000 to fund pro-grams all year, he said.
The card also includes a 10 percent dis-
count at Study Edge and the ability to rent vacuums, board games, speakers, sports balls and to cash personal checks up to $25 through 
IRHA.
Vicki DeJaco, a 19-year-old psychology 
sophomore, said she enjoys being able to use 
recreational equipment, such as a pool table and an air hockey table, at her residence hall.
“The Keys game room is like the South-
west [gym] of game rooms,” DeJaco said.  “It is so nice, awesome and has everything. Also, my area puts on the best events.”IRHA offers new discounts,

Daniella Graubard ate a $4 Italian 
Toasty Torpedo sandwich almost every 
day of her sophomore year.
But the 21-year-old advertising senior 
can no longer get her favorite Quiznos sub on campus. Gator Dining Services is replacing Quiznos in the Hub with a Provisions on Demand Market.
The new P .O.D. location will open in 
late September or early October, Mar-keting Program Manager for Gator Din-ing Services Jill Rodriguez wrote in an email.
“The P .O.D. Market offers numerous 
grab-and-go items, including snacks, sandwiches and beverages,” she wrote. “With the Hub being such a busy loca-tion on campus, we felt this type of con-cept would better meet our customer’s needs.”
Graubard disagreed.“People won’t go to it when Chick-
ﬁ  l-A and Starbucks are next door,” she said.
The Racquet Club dining center also 
changed its eating options for this se-mester. Chili’s Too became Chomp It, a restaurant offering sandwiches, salads and burgers.
Other changes for Gator Dining Ser-
vices include opening a P .O.D. Market and Subway at the Rawlings bus stop in Spring, Rodriguez wrote. A Fresh Food Company expansion and Gator Corner Dining Center renovation are also in the works.

Grapes of Wrath
A Gainesville resident stomps grapes Saturday at Grape Stompin’, a wine-tasting and grape-
stomping event. Paulk Vineyards, in Wray, Ga., donated one ton of muscadine grapes, said Gabrielle Fellenz, executive assistant to the director of Gainesville’s Pledge 5 Foundation. 
Aug. 31, 1966: The State Cabinet selects “Gators Embark On A Disney-
land Lark” as UF’s 1966 Homecoming slogan. The slogan was submitted 
by Mrs. J. A. Booher Jr. and was selected from more than 1,200 other en-
tries. More than 23 percent of the slogans submitted had a Disney theme. 
Others involved state politics, the space race, education and Batman.
Aug. 29, 1985: Apartheid protesters gather outside Tigert Hall to plan a 
rally advocating UF’s divestment of holdings in corporations that do busi-
ness in South Africa. The Florida Foundation had already responded to 
previous protests by unanimously rejecting the protesters’ demands and instead passing a resolution to maintain investments in companies adher -
ing to the Sullivan Principles, which state African-Americans will hold 
managerial positions and that workplaces must be desegregated.
Aug. 26, 1987: The UF Men’s Glee Club has its 1987-88 budget eliminat-
ed by UF’s Student Government during budget hearings because no club 
representatives were present. Club members claimed that they showed up 
for two of the SG Student Senate’s budget and finance meetings but had 
their presentation pushed back and were never notified of later meetings.

Don’t get lost at recruitment next week — 
two Interfraternity Council fraternities at UF 
relocated before the start of the school year.
Tau Kappa Epsilon moved out of Col-
lier Hall on University Avenue, said Logan 
Manderscheid, the 20-year-old vice president 
of TKE.The chapter did not move into a different 
house. Instead, many of its members have spread out in houses behind Midtown.
“Essentially it was our chapter’s decision 
not to re-sign because it was such an enor -
mous price for no quality at all,” Mandersc-heid said, adding that not having to pay rent 
will increase the social budget.
Theta Chi, which is demolishing its house 
on Fraternity Row and building a new one on the same property , will move into Collier Hall 
for the year, said Rob Wheeler, 20-year-old vice president of Theta Chi. The new house should be ready by July 2013.
Zeta Beta Tau could be moving soon, too, 
said Sean Quinn, the 19-year-old public rela-tions director of UF’s Interfraternity Council.
Ideally , IFC doesn’t want to see this much 
movement because “it usually means that there’s an issue with discipline,” Quinn said.Sigma Pi and Phi Sigma Kappa are also 
houseless fraternities, Quinn said. These chap-ters will be conducting next week’s rush on Flavet Field, according to the IFC website.
Quinn, Manderscheid and Wheeler agreed 
that being without a house or living in an off-campus house does affect recruitment. But 
moving has its benefits.
“I think it’s going to do a lot of good for the 
fraternity,” Manderscheid said.Two UF fraternities relocate, more houses could move soon4, ALLIGATOR � MONDAY, AUGUST 27, 2012

Patrick Quinney, lead guitarist and vocalist for Children’s Children, performs at 
:08 in downtown Gainesville during the AM/FM Music Festival on Sunday.
The locations and identities of two of the robbers are unknown
be there so he could come and have 
his friends rob us.”
About 15 minutes later, Lewis 
and two unknown men, wearing black bandanas around their faces, 
barged into the apartment. The wit-
ness said Lewis ordered the group to hand over their cellphones. 
One of the unknown men held 
a gun to Bleasdale’s head, ordering him from room to room and asking him where his belongings were as the other unknown man searched the kitchen.
Lewis pulled out his gun and or -
dered the two women to get on the ground. One of the witnesses said she fought back, kicking Lewis in the groin. When the women, who are both Santa Fe College students, tried to escape, the men threw them 
across the room.
After five minutes, Lewis and 
the two unknown men fled from the 
apartment with two cellphones, two wallets and about $600 in cash.The women shouted at a neigh-
bor to call the police from the balco-ny as Bleasdale and Dayton ran after the men to see where they fled to.
When police arrived, one of the 
women explained that Robinson 
had called the students moments 
before the robbery.
Police found Robinson and Hunt 
at Canopy Apartments, 4400 SW 20th Ave., where they recovered $190, 2 grams of marijuana and Day-ton’s HTC G2 cellphone. 
Deputies arrested Hunt and Rob-
inson and questioned them early 
Friday morning.  Robinson told the following sto-
ry, according to a ASO arrest report:
Lewis picked up Hunt and Rob-
inson Thursday night, looking for a 
drug dealer.  He then picked up the unknown men and drove them to 
the Reflections Apartment complex.
Once inside the complex, Lewis 
parked his white Chevrolet Monte 
Carlo. He and the two unknown men then went up to Bleasdale and Dayton’s apartment.
A few minutes later, the men re-
turned with a large amount of mon-ey, marijuana and cellphones.
Police interviewed Lewis on Sat-urday. He said he picked up Robin-son and Hunt and took them to the house of Donte Bradley.
Based on the evidence, police ar -
rested Lewis at 10:24 p.m. Saturday and booked him into jail that night.
At press time, there was no infor -
mation on the whereabouts of the unknown men.
Robinson, Hunt and Lewis re-
mained in Alachua County Jail Sun-day . Bonds for Robinson and Hunt are set at $195,000. Lewis’ bond is set at $630,000.

UF’s co-ed competitive a cappella group is upping the tem-
po this year.
No Southern Accent plans to recruit new vocalists, compete 
at festivals and record its second album. Half of the group’s 16 
singers graduated in the spring, so it plans to recruit eight new 
members this semester. Auditions are from 6 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. 
on Wednesday and Thursday in Room 357 of the Reitz Union.
No Southern Accent especially needs a beatboxer, said mu-
sical director Alex Greene, 21.
“Without instruments, you have to transpose everything 
to voice,” Greene, a materials science and engineering junior, said. “You have to make it sound real.”The group, which was founded in 2001, performs songs 
without instruments.
“You take all the layers of a song and break it into different 
vocal parts,” Greene said.
Along with adding new members, the group will now re-
hearse three times a week instead of two. The first song the members will work on is “I Won’t Give Up” by Jason Mraz, and they eventually plan to release a second CD.
While the group is based at UF, the members plan to take their talents outside Gainesville.
No Southern Accent takes trips throughout the year, said 
President C.J. Wittus, a 20-year-old criminology junior.
The group will perform for the Brevard Gator Club’s Gator 
Nation Vacation cruise at the end of September, Wittus said. It’s also auditioning to compete against other southeastern col-leges at SoJam, an a cappella festival in November in North Carolina.
No Southern Accent can be seen on campus, too. The sing-
ers will perform at Orange and Brew throughout the semester and put on gameday flash mobs for tailgaters.
“I think the potential we have with all of those new singers 
will really give us a chance to achieve a level of performance that we’ve never really had before,” Greene said.No Southern Accent hopes to start year on right note

The UF Supreme Court unanimously 
approved a nonbinding referendum Friday 
asking students if the Reitz Union should be renamed.
Referendums gauge student opinion. 
They don’t have direct impact on adminis-tration or Student Government policy.
The Supreme Court approved the refer -
endum for SG elections on Oct. 2 and Oct. 3, pending that referendum author, Students Party President Ford Dwyer, gets signatures 
from 1 percent of the Student Body  — about 500 people.
Dwyer’s referendum asks students about 
renaming the union after Virgil Hawkins, 
an African-American who was denied en-
trance to UF in 1949 because of his race.
“Along with the student union’s new 
face, I think the student union deserves a new name,” Dwyer said.
Besides noting Hawkins’ achievements, 
the referendum mentions J. Wayne Reitz’s delay in racially integrating UF. He also collaborated in the purging of gay students 
and professors during his time as university 
president, according to the referendum.
If a majority of students answer “yes” to 
the question in October, Dwyer said he will bring the name change before UF’s Board of Trustees. If not, he will drop the issue.

A new Downtown nightclub opened this 
weekend, attracting droves of UF students and 
Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte.
Simons Nightclub hosted its grand opening 
at 8 S. Main St. on Saturday night, following its 
soft opening on Thursday and Friday . 
“We focused on three distinct things: The 
service, the music and the ambiance,” said Ryan 
Prodesky, director of marketing for 101 Manage-ment, which provides management and service solutions for leisure and hospitality brands. 
The club reached its 440-person capacity by 
midnight, said Jordan Best, a 22-year-old secu-rity guard and UF alumnus.
Club goers entered a 6,500-square-foot, en-
tirely white room. Guests shouted cocktail or -
ders as others nudged to get to the front of the bar. Music blared out of speakers, pulsating with the dancing bodies.
All VIP tables sold out at Simons on Satur -
day and were dotted with celebrities, including Lochte.
The UF alumnus spent the majority of the 
night in the sectioned-off VIP lounge. Lochte briefly left the VIP section to join the crowd on the dance floor.
He sipped on drinks throughout the evening, 
talking with fans and posing for pictures.

Attendees at a series of meetings 
Friday discussed UF’s character 
and the qualities its new president 
should have.
Faculty members cited UF’s af-
fordability, student quality and 
research opportunities as notable 
strengths of the university. 
Later, the group of about 40 de-
bated whether the new president’s 
background should be academic.
“We need a strong president who 
will really talk to the legislature,” 
said College of Engineering profes-
sor Fazil Najafi.
People at the public forum talked 
about the importance of the presi-dent maintaining a balance between 
academics and athletics. 
The roughly 20 people who at-
tended referenced the diversity of 
UF’s Student Body and internation-al presence. The new president, res-idents thought, should be an effec-
tive communicator who is creative enough to bring new funding to the 
university. 
He or she also needs to be ap-
proachable, value student engage-ment and be aware of the issues fac-ing higher education. 
Similarly, the 20 students who 
attended the student forum agreed 
that UF’s next president needs to be 
extremely student-oriented.
“It’s a little frustrating when they 
say students are a focus and there’s 
one student on the search commit-
tee,” said Dustin Pfundheller, a 26-year-old dental student.He and Casey LaMarche, a 
27-year-old chemical engineering graduate student, thought it was important to choose a president who will recognize that graduate 
and professional students are as im-
portant to UF as undergraduates.
“It’s still important to me that [all 
students] at UF feel like their presi-dent is doing good stuff for them,” 
LaMarche said.

The first man to set foot on the moon has left the earth 
for the last time.
Neil Armstrong, the American astronaut who traveled 
aboard the Apollo 11 in July 1969 to make the first lunar 
landing, died Saturday.
The 82-year-old, who underwent heart surgery this 
month, “passed away following complications resulting from cardiovascular procedures,” according to a state-ment from family members.
He was 38 years old when he made 
his famous second trip into space with 
fellow astronauts Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin and Michael Collins.
Alden Chodash, an 18-year-old 
chemical engineering freshman, said the lunar landing inspired several gen-erations to overcome challenges.
“He defied expectations and showed 
that the sky really isn’t the limit,” Cho-
dash said. “It opened up a whole new era of astrology and space exploration.”
Alex Chisholm, a 21-year-old physics senior, said Arm-
strong is an important role model for students who dream 
of traveling to space.
He said he remembered the astronaut for his iconic 
phrase, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for 
mankind.”
“It’s all summarized in that little quote,” Chisholm 
said. “It symbolizes what humanity is capable of.”

It’s not as simple as 
red or blue
Each semester, the Alligator seeks new columnists to fill 
up its opinions pages. In our application, we usually ask ap-
plicants to include a brief explanation of their political and ideological viewpoints.
We have been asking this question since last August, be-
cause the Alligator — whether you believe we are a left-wing rag or a Fox News wannabe — has tried to consistently include a diverse set of viewpoints. But we are also very adamant that our applicants avoid using partisan labels (i.e., Democrat or Republican) when describing their views.
Whether the media and political elites like it or not, fewer 
Americans fit the classic binary mold of political sorting. Al-though there hasn’t been significant change in terms of those who identify as Republican or Democrat over the years, a poll 
by the Pew Research Center shows that the number of people 
who identify as Independent has increased from about 26 percent of the electorate to 33 percent over the last 10 years.
Watch MSNBC or Fox News on any given day, and it’s 
hard not to believe that the country is growing more polar -
ized. However, these media outlets and politicians fail to point out that, statistically, polarization is only really happen-ing among the elites.
It’s getting even harder to separate us by political ideol-
ogy, i.e., liberal or conservative. In 2008, political scientists Morris P . Fiorina and Samuel J. Abrams found that moderates continue to make up the largest category of the electorate, ac-cording to survey data.
More importantly, there is still a debate among scholars 
about whether or not people actually know the meaning of terms such as liberal or conservative. How can we trust media polls and reports when people don’t even know what these terms mean? How can we even begin to classify people into 
tight-fitting ideologies when they likely differ on more than 
a dozen issues?
If someone supports low taxes and less business regulation 
but supports gay marriage and drug legalization, is that per -
son a conservative or a liberal? Some would say that they’re a libertarian, but maybe they vote for the Democrats or even the Green Party.
Given this ambiguity about the political leanings of Amer -
icans, why do we try to identify everyone’s political positions 
with labels that have become increasingly meaningless to 
most people? We the people often deserve just as much blame as the media and political elites.
While we all argue with each other, struggling to fit per -
fectly into team red or team blue, those in power seek to in-crease the government’s control and reach.
Instead, shouldn’t we be focusing on issues and not par -
ties? Shouldn’t we be focusing on individual ideas and not ideological labels?
Of course, we do not demand that everyone figure out 
their political beliefs or even that everyone care about politics. Just don’t feel forced into following or supporting one of the two major parties without thinking or caring.A long time ago, when I was a weaker man, a “friend” of mine hosted a party and had the gall to charge everyone who went a cover. Not a sug-
gested donation to cover party expenses; straight-up cover.
We’ll call him Taylor Lautner.He alleged the party “would be the talk of the uni-
versity.”
The theme of the party was delightfully crude: “CEOs 
and office hoes.” I’d promised to drive a friend from the party to get Taco Bell. When I arrived to pick him up, Taylor Lautner demanded I pay a cover to go in. I didn’t want to make a scene, so I just paid him and found my friends.
Only eight dudes and the host’s girlfriend had shown 
up. The dent made in the alcohol was far less than the dent in the attendees’ wallets.
Taylor Lautner did not give us any of our money 
back.
While this experience didn’t serve as the wake-up 
call it should have for me, it did get the boulder rolling for one of the more important realizations to have here: There are a lot of crummy people at UF — particularly of 
the sophomoric variety.
While you’ll hear the administration and faculty boast 
of a continuing increase in the quality of students here, 
one need only attend a single lecture in an intro to tele-communication class to see that quite a few dumb-dumbs still get into UF.
Hell, it’s only been three days, and I’ve met a political 
science major who said the national issue of greatest im-port to her was “Obamacare,” because “people seem to 
keep saying it’s something to be concerned about.”
If average GPA and SAT scores for the freshman class 
keep increasing, then how do these specimens of as-
tounding stupidity continue to get into this university?
I have a theory that isn’t backed up by much evidence 
and probably has a lot of holes.
However, my study of broadcast news has taught me 
that passing off such a theory as fact on prime-time tele-vision fits under the definition of journalism, so that’s exactly what I’m going to do.
(See: the Miami zombie never 
having done bath salts, whatev-
er is playing on Fox News at the 
time of you reading this.)
Whenever I’ve had the mis-
fortune of falling into a conver -
sation with a dumb-dumb, I’ve 
asked them if their parents went here. Invariably, the majority of them say “yes.” I think UF, like many other universities across the country, weighs the children of alumni more favorably than kids who don’t have any 
alumni in their immediate family.
Why else would they ask you to list the alumni in your 
family on your application if they didn’t?
If you look up the history of admission statistics for 
UF — or the history of any large state school, really — 
you’ll see that there was a significant period where these schools accepted just about anyone. Spouses typically have similar levels of intelligence, as do their kids.
And it’s these kids who I think are inflating the levels 
of bourgie floozies in our classes.
Just to be clear, I’m not saying all the children of alum-
ni are part of this dumb-dumb infestation. I have a string of alumni in my immediate family myself that no doubt helped in my admission. But when you do meet someone in your classes with questionable credentials, how else can you explain it?
Having alumni family members is one of the few re-
maining intelligence-neutral aspects of admission, since 
the state of Florida outlaws considering race and gender 
as factors.
I can’t think of any other way to explain the large 
number of premeds turned entrepreneurial club promot-ers who roam our halls.

No need to fight when we can talk
The Israeli government is in an uproar 
about United Nations Secretary-General 
Ban Ki-moon visiting Iran for a summit 
hosted by the Non-Aligned Movement, a 
group of 120 countries that formed during the Cold War. Many countries are those the United States has sought to marginal-
ize.
This year, Iran is hosting the summit 
and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Ne-
tanyahu cannot accept that Ban will just be talking to Iranian leaders and representa-tives. Netanyahu was quoted as saying to Ban, “Your visit will grant legitimacy to a regime that is the greatest threat to world 
peace and security.”  Likewise, a pro-Israe-
li group, the American Jewish Committee, stated that Tehran should not be the place for Ban to visit because “…[he] would honor a regime that consistently ignores 
both him and the world body he heads in 
ways that threaten both regional and glob-al security.”I couldn’t help but think that this quote 
actually seems to talk about many actions of the Israeli government!  Such double standards.
Talking never hurt anybody, and Iran 
is a sovereign country like Israel, which means Ban has every right and obligation to attend the Non-Aligned Movement’s meetings, as it is customary for the secre-
tary general to do — regardless of political 
sensitivities surrounding the host coun-try.The Israeli government should welcome 
dialogue instead of preventing it, even if it dislikes which countries are communicat-ing with each other and the United Na-
tions Secretary-General.  Additionally, Ban 
should not feel pressure from the Israeli government to avoid this summit.

Gov. Rick Scott and his advisers really need to get out 
more. If they were more clued in, Scott would not be out there taking credit for stopping the FCAT.
Here’s a news flash: The FCAT was always going away . 
Scott had nothing whatsoever to do with that. Gov. Charlie 
Crist implemented a plan to phase the FCAT out by 2014.
The truth didn’t stop approval-hungry Scott from starring 
in a Republican Party political ad denouncing the FCAT. “We 
need our testing system to evolve so there’s no more teach-ing to the test.” Who can argue with that? Scott’s boys must have been hyperventilating over their own cleverness. That’s brave of them to steal the very words moms and teachers have been saying for years.
Scott goes on to say , “That’s why , next year, our schools 
will move to a ‘common core’ system.”
Wrong.Florida is not moving to Common Core because the FCAT 
is bad. Florida committed years ago to adopt the Common Core State Standards Initiative, which includes a test called the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers, or PARCC.
Shameless pandering is not new for Scott, nor is twisting 
the truth to eke out approval points. Let’s not forget that for 
14 long years real children have been hurt by the high-stakes 
FCAT testing process.
Too many Florida children are filled with worry when 
they should be enjoying their fleeting childhoods and be excited about learning. Every adult should be grief stricken over the millions of children who never learned to be critical thinkers because of these failed, politically driven reforms.
In theory, the Common Core state standards are great.To function properly, they require an even playing field. 
That means charter schools, voucher schools and traditional schools would be required to take the same tests and be mea-sured by the same standards. Uniformity and equity.
But this is Florida.Politicians and bureaucrats never miss an opportunity to use a new program to disman-tle, defund and discredit tradi-tional public schools. Scott isn’t fooling the moms of this state.
High-stakes testing is the 
problem. For the past 14 years, Florida students have shown small incremental gains and earned uneven successes on the National Assessment of Educational Progress exam. They have struggled with the constant change of one untested, ex-pensive and unproven reform after another.
Florida politicians have wasted billions of taxpayer dol-
lars on the testing industry re-purposing a failed product. That money was intended for classrooms, not Pearson Test Prep.
It’s time for real parents and teachers to set the education 
policy table. We deserve to have a healthy suspicion of a “re-form agenda” driven by unmitigated greed.
The united effort of parents, teachers and school boards is 
the only thing standing between Florida’s children and de-structive high-stakes tests.
Tallahassee bureaucrats can call it PARCC, FCAT or the 
“Big Live or Die Test.” If it’s high stakes, it’s not good for kids.
Gov. Scott, your image team will have to work a lot hard-
er to raise your credibility with us. Parents and teachers are determined to work together to renew the promise of high-quality learning and embrace examinations that stem organi-cally from teacher-driven classroom content, encourage criti-cal thought and measure a level of mastery that cannot ever be “bubbled in.”
One way or another, the parents of this state will be at that 
education policy table to clean up this mess.

Sometimes, men just need to shut up.
Todd Akin, a GOP representative from Missouri 
and U.S. Senate hopeful, caused a firestorm recently 
for his remarks in an interview in which he clarified his 
stance on abortion in cases of rape.
“If it’s a legitimate rape,” Akin said, “the female body 
has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.”
In light of these remarks, which Mitt Romney called 
“inexcusable” and President Obama condemned as “of-
fensive,” Akin has since recanted his comments. Yet, de-spite calls from those in his own party to withdraw from the race, Akin announced Friday afternoon his determi-nation to continue his campaign for U.S. Senate.
In a video apology , Akin begs for the American public’s 
forgiveness and said that he had “used the wrong words,” later vowing that despite it all, “I’m not a quitter,” and “by the grace of God, we’re going to win this race.”
In fact, everywhere you tune into this scandal, Akin is 
willing to give a sound bite, video clip or interview.
Akin’s comments and his refusal to shut up about 
them show a complete lack of empathy and understand-ing toward women. His attitude also underscores why , as President Obama has said, “we shouldn’t have a bunch of 
politicians, a majority of whom are men, making health care decisions on behalf of wom-en.”
Moreover, Akin exposes 
a nasty trend in our country’s discussions on women’s 
health: The parameters, content and participants in these 
discussions are largely determined by men.
Men just need to shut up about women’s issues. This 
doesn’t mean that men are not allowed to have opinions on things like abortion and health care. Neither does it mean that men should just avoid talking about women’s issues at all costs. By “shut up,” I mean men should em-ploy a critical silence. This doesn’t mean closing your eyes but rather opening your ears — listening.  By effectively 
stepping out of the way, listening can open up a space 
where women can speak for themselves.
By doing more listening than talking, perhaps men 
could learn a few things themselves in this discussion, or at the very least, give women a platform from which to speak on their own terms. Rhetoric and composition scholar Krista Ratcliffe has called this “Rhetorical Listen-ing,” or rather, a productive silence that engages public debate more by letting others speak.
As a teacher of writing, we are often told to “cultivate 
our own silence” in classroom discussions, allowing our students to generate ideas without too much directive prodding. Similarly, the national dialogue in this country could benefit from a cultivation of silence on behalf of a huge chunk of the noisiest students: men.
Men in general, and Akin in particular, need to find 
more rhetorically productive ways to engage the conver -
sation on women’s health. In a world where almost 90 
percent of violent crime and 99 percent of rape is commit-
ted by men, perhaps we need to cultivate a more critical silence on issues that pertain to women.
In other words, men just need to shut up.Tyler Branson is a columnist for the Daily Skiff at the T exas

 Erika Tymrak knew just what to do in 
the ﬁ  rst period of extra time. 
  As she raced by a Duke defender and 
stormed into the attacking third, Tymrak 
saw redshirt senior forward McKenzie Barney wide open. Tymrak slipped the ball to Barney and told her to run towards 
the box. 
  Barney then gave Tymrak a perfect feed 
and an opportunity to defeat last year’s 
national championship runner-up and seal UF’s ﬁ  rst win of the season.
  Off a give-and-go, Tymrak sunk a gold-
en goal in the lower left corner of the net in the 93rd minute to help the Gators (1-1-1) climb out of a two-goal deﬁ  cit and stun 
No. 2 Duke (2-1-0) 3-2 in overtime Sunday 
afternoon. 
The goal was the ﬁ  rst of 2012 for the se-
nior midﬁ  elder. 
  “She literally put it right on my foot,” 
Tymrak said. “I don’t really remember much of it, because I was still in the mo-ment. I kicked it, and it might have deﬂ  ect-ed off of someone, but it went in.”
  Sunday’s match, which took place at 
the Carolina Nike Classic in Chapel Hill, N.C., was UF’s second to reach extra time on the weekend. 
Florida and No. 14 North Carolina 
played to a scoreless double-overtime draw Friday night.   “We went into [Sunday’s] game with 
a big chip on our shoulder,” coach Becky Burleigh said. 
“It was a good chance for us to get a 
little redemption from the way we started the season.” 
  The Blue Devils struck ﬁ  rst in the ninth 
minute when Gilda Doria buried a 20-
yard shot into the lower right corner of the 
net. After Duke’s Cassie Pecht retrieved a loose ball and scored in the 29th minute, the Gators were in an early 2-0 hole. 
  Unlike in their season opener, in which 
they fell behind 3-0 to Mi-ami at the half and even-tually lost 4-1, the Gators didn’t panic.
  “We were pretty re-
laxed,” Tymrak said. “We 
looked at each other, and we had conﬁ  dence.”
  In the 39th minute, 
UF answered as sophomore forward Jil-lian Graff booted a goal from 15 yards out. Sophomore midﬁ  elder Havana Solaun earned the assist on the play. 
  “Once that goal went in, everyone got 
pumped up,” Graff said. “Their emo-tions were high. We were able to execute more.”
  The Gators tied up the score in the sec-
ond half, when a cross sent by Tymrak deﬂ  ected off the back of a Duke defender. The 64th-minute score was deemed an

� MUSCHAMP IS EXPECTED TO 
RELEASE A DEPTH CHART TODAY.    JOSH JURNOVOY
 Alligator Staff Writer
  Last Monday was supposed to be “De-
cision Day” for the Gators, as Will Mus-
champ would release the season-opening depth chart. He decided to delay the deci-sion for a week so he could further evalu-
ate his players.
  Today, Muschamp is expected to ﬁ  nal-
ize his depth chart for Saturday’s game 
against Bowling Green.
  However, on Friday , Muschamp 
said one position battle would not be settled before the Gators take the ﬁ  eld against the Falcons: quarterback.Jacoby Brissett and Jeff Driskel will split 
time under center against Bowling Green.
  Both quarterbacks impressed the head 
coach enough in fall practice that he 
wants to see each in game action before naming one as the starter for the Texas A&M game in Week 2. Muschamp said he might wait until Wednesday or Thurs-day to announce a starter for the opener.“They both deserve the right to play,” Mus-champ said Friday. “They’ve earned that and they both deserve the right to start. They both have had really good camps.”
Muschamp added that both quarter-
backs have been completing about 63 per-
cent of their passes in scrimmages. It was 
following the second scrimmage that Mus-champ knew Brissett and Driskel would both play in the opener.
“We’ve tried to put them in tough situ-
ations and they’ve both handled it well,” Muschamp said. “As we work into com-petition on game day, we’ll see if there is some separation.”
  In order to simulate a game-day at-
mosphere for the quarterbacks, Mus-champ said the team has practiced on a 40-second play clock for all of fall practice. He has also instructed offen-sive coordinator Brent Pease to signal play calls late to help teach Driskel and Brissett how to handle hectic situations when the play clock is winding down.Both quarterbacks will play
  History dictates that this season will not be kind to Florida head coach Will Muschamp.
  Call it the “Ray Graves Trend.”  Since Graves resigned from his position 
as the Gators head football coach following the 1969 season, every Florida coach has ex-perienced either signiﬁ  cant success or disap-pointment in their second year at the helm in a magical, alternating pattern.
  The trend began with Doug Dickey in 
1971. After posting a 7-4 record in his ﬁ  rst season replacing Graves, Dickey ﬁ  nished his second season 4-7.
  After an up-and-down nine-year tenure, 
Dickey was ﬁ  red.
  The Gators’ next coach, Charley Pell, 
had much better luck during his second go-around. After leading Florida to its only win-less season in 1979, he rebounded with an 8-4 mark in 1980. Pell was eventually ousted 
three games into the 1984 season after com-
mitting 107 NCAA infractions.
  Galen Hall went from 9-1-1 in 1985 in his 
ﬁ  rst full season to 6-5 in 1986. Bad.
  Steve Spurrier led the Gators to their ﬁ  rst 
10-win season and ﬁ  rst-ever Southeastern Conference title in his second season in 1991. Good.
  Ron Zook ﬁ  n-
ished 8-5 in 2003 — bad —  and Ur-ban Meyer claimed 
Florida’s second 
national champion-ship in 2006 — you guessed it, good.
  But history could 
change. In the Bowl Championship Series era, three second-year head coaches have hoisted the crystal football at season’s end.
  Florida offensive coordinator Brent Pease 
believes Muschamp is capable of following in the footsteps of Bob Stoops, Gene Chizik and Meyer.
  “You get to the point where he’s put his 
stamp on the program,” Pease said. “You’ve got a feel of the kids and you’ve built up your standards and how to interact.   They know 
what’s right, they know what’s wrong. They 
know what is going to ﬂ  y in the system and what’s not going to ﬂ  y in the system.”
  Gators history says one thing, and recent 
trends say another. However, in this case, the “Ray Graves Trend” wins out, because UF is  History, offense will doom UFFIRE JOE MORGANSEE SOCCER, PAGE 14

Gators find offensive groove, launch ten shots in surprising win
own goal.  
“Coach is always telling me 
‘Drill it in. It’s going to hit off 
someone,’” Tymrak said.  
Before the Gators finished off 
the Blue Devils in extra time, they had a chance to close it out in the 85th minute. 
Senior midfielder Holly King 
scored off a pass from Tymrak, 
but an off-
side call 
erased the 
play.  “I would like to see the one 
they called back, because that was so well executed,” Burleigh said. 
Florida finally found its offen-
sive rhythm on Sunday, racking 
up 10 shots, including four on 
goal. Against UNC, the Gators tal-
lied their lone shot on goal in ex-tra time. 
Sophomore goalkeeper Taylor 
Burke finished with five saves against Duke.
After defeating the team that 
knocked them out of the second round of the NCAA Tournament in 2010, the Gators leave Chapel Hill, N.C., with a huge confi-
dence boost. 
“Everyone on this team knew 
that we’re a really good team,” 
Burleigh said. “And we just had to go out and prove it.” SOCCER , from page 13
UF Soccera mess.
  This team dictates that this season will 
not be kind to Muschamp.
  Forgive the cliché, but if you have two 
quarterbacks, then you do not have one. 
Frankly , this team was better off with John 
Brantley in 2010.
  Also, is it really reasonable to rely on 
Mike Gillislee to anchor a running game hampered by inexperienced quarterbacks? Please.
  Gillislee’s predictions for his output this 
season are insane.
  He is not running for 1,500 yards, and 
there is no way he will score 24 touch-downs to break Tim Tebow’s single-season SEC record of 23.
  In fact, I’ll be surprised if Gators ﬁ  nd 
the end zone in the ground game 24 times combined in 2012.  Until the receivers prove something, I 
am only giving them this one sentence.
  The same goes for the offensive line.  The defense is full of gangbusters. Ex-
pect this unit to be tougher and more ag-gressive now that they have a full year in the Muschamp-Quinn scheme under their belts. When Matt Elam calls himself a pred-ator, you don’t laugh, and you don’t run a 
route over the middle.
  Florida will play its opponents close 
with solid defense but will ultimately face 
defeat with an inefﬁ  cient offense.
  The Gators have no starting quarter-
back, unproven receivers and a suspect offensive line. Apparently , a career backup at starting running back is Florida’s only sure thing when it comes to the offense. In 
a weak SEC East, UF will not contend.
  The “Ray Graves Trend” will strike 
again in 2012.

  Junior Chloe Mann couldn’t be a more different player than 
she was at this time last year.
  During the Gators ﬁ  rst three matches in 2011, Mann played 
in only two sets and notched a total of just three kills. In Flori-
da’s ﬁ  rst set during Friday’s season opener against FIU, Mann 
more than doubled that number. 
  Mann kept that level of dominance all weekend, earning 
MVP honors as the No. 18 Gators (3-0) swept the Campus USA 
Credit Union Invitational with wins against FIU, Florida A&M and Florida Gulf Coast.
  “We have a pretty good combination there with Taylor 
Brauneis to Chloe Mann, that was pretty effective [Friday],” coach Mary Wise said. 
  Mann led the team in kills against FIU as Florida won 3-0 
(25-21, 25-14, 25-12) and tied with Betsy Smith for a team-high 
hitting percentage of .545. Mann didn’t lead the Gators in hit-
ting in a game last year until Sept. 3, when she had nine kills and hit .818 against Clemson.   In addition to her progress in hitting percentage, Mann has 
also increased her kill count compared to the beginning of last 
year. In the three matches last weekend, Mann was able to rack 
up 42 kills; last year it took her 17 matches to 
accomplish that feat.
  “Chloe and I have a really good relation-
ship because we both trained as middles,” Smith said. “Last year we both were kind of ﬁ  ghting for the same spot, and we both got better because we held each other account-able.” 
  To add to her list of improvements, 
Mann’s ﬁ  rst double-digit kill game of 2011 
didn’t come until her 16th match, which was on Oct. 30 against Kentucky. This year it only took two sets against FIU to reach double digits, and she didn’t ﬁ  nish below double digits in any of the three matches. 
  “It’s been awesome to see her progress,” Smith said. “She’s 
really hard to stop right now, and it’s awesome just to see that progression from her.”
  During Saturday’s ﬁ  rst match against FAMU, Mann fell to second on the team in kills and third in hitting behind freshmen Ziva Recek and Berkley Whaley. However, she still remained a key contributor in the 3-0 (25-11, 25-11, 25-14) win with 11 kills, two digs and three blocks.
  Mann ﬁ  nished up the weekend with a game-high 16 kills 
and four total blocks to help Florida sweep FGCU 3-0 (25-16, 25-19, 25-16).
  Mann credits the change to experience. 
  “It’s in part due to the conﬁ  dence I gained,” Mann said. 
“Just being in the program for three years and learning the 
schemes that we ran, being comfortable with the offense we 
ran, the coaches and my teammates, as well.” 
  During the weekend, the Gators held FIU, FAMU and 
FGCU to just .088 hitting, 70 kills, 67 assists and seven blocks, 
while Florida averaged .368 hitting, 132 kills, 119 assists, 110 digs and 18.5 blocks. 
  Although Mann and the Gators dominated, Wise knows 
they have a tough week ahead as they get ready to take on No. 2 Texas and No. 6 Stanford.
  “Some nights it’s not going to come easy, but it still doesn’t 
mean we won’t get everyone’s best shot,” Wise said.
“This team will compete, and some nights it will be good 
enough and some nights it won’t. The key is just keep getting better, and this group has a chance to do that.”

Rotation remains undecided
The head coach met with the quarterbacks before meeting the media on Friday and said their reaction to the news was positive.
Muschamp said he and Pease would de-
cide closer to game day exactly how they 
will rotate the two quarterbacks. He also 
said that Driskel, who has been bothered by a shoulder contusion, is still non-contact, although the injury has not affected the posi-tion battle.
“Both guys are very even and our foot-
ball team’s got great conﬁ  dence in both of them,” Muschamp said. “I told both of them today, the last position I’m worried about is 
quarterback. I feel very comfortable about 
both guys.”
  Injuries will affect the offensive line depth 
chart for at least the ﬁ  rst game, as redshirt ju-nior right tackle Matt Patchan will miss the opener with a strained pectoral muscle.   On the other side of the line, James Wil-
son has been taking ﬁ  rst-team reps at left guard next to ﬁ  rst-string left tackle Xavier Nixon and center Jonotthan Harrison.
  Defensively , there are four cornerbacks in 
the mix to start, including Marcus Roberson, 
Loucheiz Purifoy , Cody Riggs and Jay-
len Watkins.
Defensive coordi-
nator Dan Quinn says 
the team will run nickel packages enough 
that all will see the ﬁ  eld, and he has conﬁ  -dence in each of them.
  “I kind of had a feeling it would work it-
self out,” Quinn said of the cornerback com-petition. “It usually does through the course 
of the season.”
