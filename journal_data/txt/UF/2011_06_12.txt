PHOENIX (AP) — The Arizona sheriff famous for mak-
ing prisoners wear pink underwear is introducing a Spanish-
language version of the shorts he sells to the public.
Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio began issuing pink 
underwear to inmates more than 15 years ago to cut down on theft. He began selling them to the public after speaking about them on national television.
The versions that went on sale Monday are imprinted 
with “Vamos Jose!” The original shorts, also $15, feature a sheriff’s star and a “Go Joe” logo.

Gainesville’s Regional Transit 
System has a few big changes en 
route for the fall semester.
New Later Gator buses, un-
limited access passes for Santa 
Fe College students, new routes, 
extended services and bus fre-quency changes begin Aug. 15, when the Fall 2011 RTS bus ser -
vice cranks up.
For those wanting to get 
downtown for late-night activi-ties, two new Later Gator routes will be added to the growing 
lineup of public transit options. 
The new routes are Later Gator D and F.
RTS Marketing and Commu-
nications Supervisor Chip Skin-ner said the new routes are the result of numerous petitions by students living in distant apart-ment complexes who wanted a 
way downtown. 
Route D will run every 30 min-
utes from the Rosa Parks Down-
town Station to FloridaWorks at 4800 SW 13th Street. The service will be offered Thursday through Saturday from 8:45 p.m. until 2:30 a.m. 
Route F will only be available Saturday nights from 8:30 until about 2:30 a.m. Buses will travel from the Rosa Parks Downtown Station to Butler Plaza every 30 minutes.
Getting from campus to popu-
lar apartment complexes should be a little easier as well. Route 28 
will travel from the Hub at UF to 
The Estates about every 22 min-utes from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
The Route 46 circulator will 
travel from the Reitz Union to 
Southeast 3rd Avenue every half 
hour from 8 a.m. until 5:45 p.m.
The new Later Gator routes 
will increase student transporta-tion fees by 33 cents per credit hour, a necessity to pay for the new services, Skinner said.
“It’s always a delicate balance 
between ridership numbers and 
fees generated,” he said.Changes coming to 
bus transit in fallBy MICHAEl SYKES

Those in Gainesville for Gator games will now have some-
thing to do Friday nights aside from packing the cooler for the 
next day.
The United Way of North Central Florida will host down-
town street festivals before each home football game as part of the United Downtown event series, said Debbie Mason, presi-dent and CEO of United Way of North Central Florida. The festivals will give the congregation of Gator fans a chance to 
have some family-friendly fun before the games, she said.  
The city will close Southeast First Street between University 
Avenue and Southeast Second Place from 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. 
for the events.  
City Commissioner Jeanna Mastrodicasa hopes the event will raise awareness for United Way and give visitors a chance 
to see what Gainesville has to offer, she said. 
It also gives the locals who usually stay in a good reason to 
go out.
“This brings more people downtown,” she said. “And it will 
provide something positive for visitors to do.”
Christian Moreno, 20, a student at UF, said 
people avoid downtown because it’s too much 
effort to get there and park and then try to find entertainment.  
“But if you can drag people out there,” he said, “there’s a 
lot of culture.”
The events will feature local artists and live music and give 
people a chance to get involved with the United Way, Mason said. For people with kids, the event offers an alternative to the bar-type atmosphere often associated with home-game week-ends. There will be face painting booths, bounce houses and other PG-rated things to do.
“It’ll be a strolling festival with outdoor activities for fami-
lies to enjoy,” she said.
And for those who enjoy a drink to honor the football gods, 
a change in city ordinance will allow the sale of beer on the 
street during the events, Mastrodicasa said.  
But those who envision a beer-soaked free-for-all will be 
sorely disappointed — the intent of the event is to remain fam-
ily-friendly.
“This is not an outdoor party,” Mason said. “This is an out-
door information and activities festival.” 
Taylor Nones, a freshman at UF, said it’s 
hard for younger fans to feel like a part of The Gator Nation when so much focus is on drinking.   
“If [the festivals] nurture to families,” she said, “maybe the games won’t be so alcohol-oriented.” City to hold Friday festivals before UF games

Renowed photographer 
speaks at Harn
Standing in front of a crowd 
that included the admiring eyes 
of some of his former students, 
Jerry Uelsmann said he does not 
have an agenda behind his pho-tography.
“I let the viewer find the sto-
ryline they can make up,” he 
said.
The 77-year-old former UF 
graduate art professor discussed 
his career and his photographs 
at a lecture Sunday afternoon at 
the Harn Museum of Art.
About 350 people attended 
the event, where Uelsmann dis-cussed his early experimentation 
with photography and revealed 
some of his unseen work.
He also revealed work by 
Maggie Taylor, his wife and a digital image artist who scans 
and manipulates images on a 
computer.
Uelsmann contrasted his 
composite printing technique to Taylor’s use of digital techniques in her images.ern city of Mossoro is drawing 
attention with his purportedly magnet-like qualities.
The Globo TV network has 
broadcast images of Paulo Da-vid Amorim demonstrating how forks, knives, scissors, cooking pans, cameras and other metal 
objects seem drawn to his body 
and remain stuck on his chest, stomach and back.
The boy’s father tells Globo 
that he decided to test his son 
after learning of a boy in Croa-
tia with a similar ability. 
Junior Amorim says he was 
surprised to find “a fork and 
knife stuck to his body.”
The youth says classmates 
call him “magnet boy.”
Dr. Dix-Sept Rosado Sobrin-
ho tells Globo it is the first time in his 30-year career that he has 
seen a case like this.
— THE ASSOCIATED pRESS“People tend to want me to 
be anti-digital, but you can’t 
even buy film anymore,” Uels-
mann said. 
Former director of Appleton 
Museum Leonard Weinbaum was one of Uelsmann’s former 
students attending the lecture. 
“He was a big influ-
ence on me, and I was very 
privileged to be a student at 
that time,” Weinbaum said.  
Uelsmann received  $2,000 
for his lecture from funds  set aside for Creative B, a summer program that combines many 
creative programs offered at 
UF. 
Uelsmann’s work is on dis-
play at the museum, with 89 images in an exhibit that will 
run until Sept. 11 and then con-
tinue on to the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem, Mass.
The museum will celebrate 
Uelsmann’s exhibit Thursday 
with art activities and dances 
inspired by his photography.

Just like UF students, Santa Fe students will gain unlim-
ited access to RTS buses. A new Florida law, which grants the 
college permission to charge a transportation fee of about $3 per credit hour, allows Santa Fe students, faculty and staff to flash an ID card to gain access to all RTS routes, Skinner said. The fee is expected to generate more than $1 million in the first year, he said.
The difference between transportation fees at Santa Fe and 
UF is there is more demand for transportation options at the latter institution.
New routes are also planned for the Santa Fe area. Route 
62 will connect the Lexington Crossing apartments to the Oaks Mall hourly Monday through Friday from 7:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Hopping on Bus 23 will then take you to the Santa Fe campus.
Route 27, an east-side circulator, will service the down-
town Santa Fe campus, as well as residents in east Gainesville — an area that has long seen a disparity in service with west Gainesville, said Mayor Craig Lowe.
Skinner said RTS plans to increase the number of buses 
from the current 105 to 112 in the fall.Number of buses to

Most business owners support events
United Downtown could give younger fans a chance 
to have a bigger piece of the gameday pie, she said.
Jeff Hickey, part-owner of Tall Paul’s Brew House, 
located off Main Street downtown, said most of the 
business owners downtown are in support of the 
events, even though some parking will be lost by clos-
ing three blocks of Southeast First Street on a Friday night.  
But he said the downside is the poor lighting in 
downtown Gainesville.
“There’s a lot of dark spots,” he said. And, he add-
ed, people are scared to bring kids somewhere a home-less person could pop out from a dark corner.
But overall, Hickey, a father of two, said it will be 
nice to have something he can take his kids to on game day weekends — other than the game, that is. FESTIVALS , from page 1By GABRIELA ROSIAS

Rowan Milner spent his week 
adjusting to his new position as 
chairman of the Department of 
Small Animal Clinical Sciences.
Milner, 55, is replacing Colin 
Burrows, who retired after hold-
ing the position for 30 years. The appointment became effective 
July 1 and will last five years. 
The department focuses on re-
search about animal health and 
disease. Faculty also provide 
oversight for clinical services in the UF Small Animal Hospital, 
which, according to its website, 
offers medical and surgical care 
for dogs, cats, birds and exotic 
pets.
“I’ve always 
had a strong interest in re-
search, and I’m looking forward to promoting that,”  Milner said.
The department, which is 
part of the College of Veterinary Medicine, is one of the largest in 
the college, Milner said. As chair -
man, he will oversee about 90 fac-
ulty members and be responsible for faculty recruitment, mentor -
ing and promotion.
He will also be responsible for 
budget management, leadership in research and veterinary and graduate student education.
Milner, a native of South Af-
rica, began working at UF in 2001 
as part of the internal medicine 
service team. In 2005, he became the chief of veterinary oncology 
services, a post he held until 2009. 
He has also held the position of 
associate chair for research and 
graduate studies and continues to 
teach classes within the college.Vet department picks new chair

As he strutted around the ring wearing a 
feathery purple cape and a cocky grin, Lucky 
Cannon briefly stopped and turned toward a screaming youngster who just wouldn’t quit. 
Leaning toward the boy, who was inform-
ing the 6-foot-5, 266-pound, long-haired vil-lain he wasn’t a fan, Cannon, who goes by 
Jon Emminger when he’s not cracking chair 
shots off his opponents, decided he had had enough of the taunts. 
Locking his eyes on the young fan, Can-
non fired back with a “you SUCK,” leaving the boy and surrounding fans in a humbled silence. 
Any other time, this may have been 
grounds for a call to child services. But on 
Friday night, it was all part of the show.
Florida Championship Wrestling, which 
serves as a developmental program for in-
dustry superpower WWE, brought its “Sum-mer Slamarama” tour to the Martin Luther King Jr. Multipurpose Center for an event linking sport, theater and plenty of fanfare. 
For local wrestling fans, these shows have 
become their best chance to see the spectacle 
they love in person, as WWE has not visited 
the area since 2006.
“We’re a small market,” wrestling fan J.C. 
Currias said. “But these guys come here be-cause they care about getting into the small markets, and it’s really amazing.”
Friday night was FCW’s fourth show in 
Gainesville in the past year, and enthusiasts like Bobby Pitts do not understand why the 
support for FCW hasn’t translated into more 
WWE shows.
“I can’t see any reason,” he said. 
“Gainesville is a famous city. I mean you know, national champions; what more do you need?”
Wrestling fans are a passionate bunch. 
Many were lined up two hours before the 8 p.m. bell time trying to be the first through the door for a pre-show meet-and-greet with such names as WWE star John Morrison and recent “Tough Enough“ winner Andy Leavine. Some fans even have in-ring ambitions of 
their own.
“[Pro wrestling is] the only thing I’ve ever 
wanted to do,” Pitts said. “I’d like to be fa-mous so I can come back to Gainesville. … 
When I come here, it will be ‘Mr. Primetime’ 
Bobby Bennett.”
When asked for further details, Pitts was 
very specific of what “Mr. Primetime” would look like.
“If I could look like any wrestler, [Mor -
rison is] the one,” he said. “You could grate cheese on his abs. It’s ridiculous.”
UF grad Shari Krull traveled from Tam-
pa to see the show even though FCW does weekly TV tapings a short drive from her house.
“It’s just amazing that you have the breed-
ing ground for the WWE right in your back-yard, and you don’t even realize it,” Krull said.
Some performers pull double duty, work-
ing both the hectic WWE schedule and the 
FCW slate.
Celeste Bonin, better known by fans as “Kaitlyn,” is on the roster for WWE’s 
“Smackdown” brand in addition to serving as a host for Summer Slamarama. Her typi-cal week begins with “Smackdown” tapings on Tuesday followed by appearances at non-
televised live shows and then a flight home 
to Tampa, where FCW takes up any possible off days.
“You miss out on a lot of sleep and down 
time,” Bonin said. “I could never explain how intense it is to someone until someone actually goes through it. It consumes your life. It’s a lifestyle.”
When not on the road, wrestlers fill time 
with long hours of in-ring practice and classes where wrestlers practice their verbal skills, which are crucial in advancing choreo-graphed storylines. 
Wrestlers who weren’t included in Friday 
night’s show were relegated to working as ushers, selling programs and setting up the ring. They spent whatever free time they had heckling those fortunate enough to perform.
Like its parent company, FCW markets 
itself as “sports entertainment” instead of wrestling. Performers prefer to be referred to as “superstars” or “divas” in lieu of wres-tlers. 
For instance, the first thing that took place 
after an intermission was not a match, but 
a “Superstar Idol” contest in which a large 
bald man sang the Norwegian national an-them, and a 6-foot-10 Irish native won with his rendition of “Ice, Ice Baby.” 
Before the first body-slam of the night, 
there was a lengthy comedy routine where a “heel” — pro wrestling jargon for a bad guy — complained that one “babyface,” the good guy,  was trying to pull down his tights. At 
another point in the show, a heel stopped his 
match to inform the crowd via microphone he was the “King of Africa.”
“Everybody has their opinions, but we are 
entertainment, and we come to entertain,” Florida Heavyweight Champion Bo Rotun-do said. “I guarantee you, if you come to an FCW show, you’re going to get entertained.”
However, just because it is entertainment 
and events are scripted doesn’t mean there aren’t harsh realities.
“It’s not fake,” said Titus O’Neill, who 
was in Friday’s six-man tag-team main event. “It’s predetermined. We know who’s going to win or lose. But at the end of the day, guys really get hurt. Injuries really do happen. You do get kicked and you do get punched.”
O’Neill, who in a previous life was UF 
defensive end and Student Body Vice Presi-dent Thaddeus Bullard, needed a new line of work after his football career fizzled. It was when his friend and six-time world cham-pion Dave Bautista showed him his Wrestle-Mania check that he saw a potential future in “the business.”
But for others such as Rotundo, whose 
real name is Taylor Rotunda, it’s a fam-
ily tradition. Wrestling fans might know his 
grandfather and father as the mustachioed, cowboy hat-wearing Blackjack Mulligan and the suspender-clad, unruly accountant Ir -
win R. Schyster, respectively. His two uncles wrestled, as does his older brother, better known as Husky Harris.
“You grow up around it, and you’re so 
comfortable, and it’s something you love,” 
he said. “It’s a lot of fun.”4, ALLIGATOR n TUESDAY, JULY 12, 2011

Today’s question: Are you 
excited for the new Harry Potter movie?
222 TOTAL VOTES83% YES17% NOThursday’s question: Do you think Nancy Grace is an irresponsible TV commentator? That Ain’t Right
When a 168-year-old 
British tabloid read by millions goes 
down in the flames, we have to say something.
News of the World pub-
lished for the last time Sun-day after backlash from the public and advertisers over a phone-hacking scandal. It was revealed that reporters pried into the voice mail ac-counts of celebrities and rela-tives of dead soldiers — all in 
the name of finding the next 
juicy , front-page scandal. 
Not cool. This is not a case of a poor 
publication going under de-spite its best attempts to stay afloat and fight the good fight. This is a case of garbage re-porters using garbage tactics. 
There were serious ethical and 
legal lines that were crossed, and the paper got what it de-served.  
And in case this fuels some 
people’s fire over a perceived irrelevance of print media or even journalism in gen-eral, we don’t think anybody should get carried away.
Good journalists don’t be-
have this way. Good report-ers have ethics and strive to develop the trust of both our audience and our sources. Given the amount of outrage this incident has sparked, we are confident that the majority of the public understands that these actions are not common-
place in the fourth estate.
This kind of activity is not 
indicative of the industry as 
a whole — even if it turned-out that  more of Rupert-Murdoch’s “news” organiza-tions have dubious practices (which wouldn’t surprise us), it should be known that there 
are many ethical journalists 
out there fighting to do the right thing the right way.
We want readers to know 
that we consider this a blem-ish on the face of journalism.Bronze Bomb
Do we really need awkward 
statues to get cultured?
If you haven’t noticed recently, there have been some new additions to the UF and Gainesville community. They aren’t the swarms of parents and potential students who quizzi-
cally roam the campus, nor are they the people who hand out fliers for some benefit show or campus club. In fact, they don’t 
do anything except waltz and creepily stare as you walk to your 
next class.
The new additions are part of “Crossing Paths,” an exhibi-
tion of bronze statues that are supposed to capture everyday scenes of life.
But after taking a look at these figures, we feel these statues 
do need to cross a path — right into an RTS bus. 
Look, we appreciate the university and the city trying to 
bolster its cultural bona fides. While Alachua County may not 
exactly be Paris or Venice, there is a lot of untapped artistic po-
tential  that students and residents alike can appreciate.
These statues, however, don’t fall into that category.It was bad enough to have a 20-foot disjointed eyesore over -
looking the Plaza of the Americas. Now the North Lawn has turned into an awkward dance floor. What exactly are students supposed to get out of seeing these prancing hulks of art? “Hey guys, the weather sucks, your job prospects are dwindling and your university is getting taken to the woodshed financially — 
let’s all get up and dance!”
But then again, we may just be more autistic than artistic 
on this one. Art is a completely subjective thing, and it’s quite 
possible we may be talking out of our backside. After all, we are the paper that ran a cartoon showing a male plowing his female sexual counterpart in a (not-so) humorous attempt to make light of the Red Cross’ relief efforts in Haiti following the earthquake. 
It’s at least better than Family Circus.
ABC Family Ad Blitz: Accio Facepalm
For those who are living in a cave and are unaware, the 
final Harry Potter film debuts in U.S. theaters Friday . 
Some fans will argue that so much content was in 
the seventh book that it was necessary for the story to be split into two movies. I’m sure it’s completely unrelated to 
the assloads of money the Harry Potter franchise makes from 
two movies as opposed to just one. I, for one, am looking forward to the conclusion of the series in which I can enjoy fights between valiant wizards and Schutzstaffel Death Eat-ers, before seeing another incredibly unnecessary Hermione-Harry dance scene. 
Thank you for again showcasing the Hollywood liberal 
ideal that a man and woman can never have a completely platonic relationship. In the end, always be on guard because 
some wizard will  awkwardly sway with your woman as 
soon as you go off to fix your wand or pout. F**k off, Harry, Ron called dibs. Go snog your ugly ginger. 
Before watching the movie this Friday (or before then if 
you have a functional computer and the appropriate moral composition for illegal activities), it is obvious that re-watch-ing the previous movies is a necessity. Thankfully, ABC Fam-ily broadcasts them every weekend. 
And with this joy comes ABC Family’s ability to effective-
ly shatter my emotional stability with nauseatingly over-the-top dramatic non-drama and depressing “action advertise-ments.”
This channel seems to entice a diverse audience with a 
combination of both teenybopper public service announce-ments and a shit ton of guilt.
Will you make the journey to build awareness by watch-
ing the ABC Family exclusive movie “Cyberbully”?
How about “Switched at Birth,” a stunning representa-
tion of the struggle of people who were swapped at birth? So devastated by their identity crisis, they are incapable of showing any form of gratitude for being cared for by two white, upper-class, suburban families from birth. 
Even better is the barrage of ads from the World Wildlife Fund or ASPCA.
Now, before you accuse me of be-
ing a cold-hearted bastard, realize I recently obtained a new 10-week-old orange tabby domestic short hair kit-
ten.
Little boy cat is at the stage where 
he is not quite an absolute menace 
and hasn’t pissed over random house objects.
And sometimes he can be a little bastard, but I love the 
damn thing. 
Some people mute the TV and look down until the com-
mercial is gone. Some get emotionally charged and become 
motivated to donate or buy a new pet. 
I just get pissed off. People are capable of filming these 
animals in cages, financing the production of the commercial 
and paying ABC Family for the commercial time. Yet they can’t release the animals from the cages?
Besides caring for domestic animals, I can also “symboli-
cally adopt” a polar bear from WWFprotects.org.
Why the f**k would I want to symbolically adopt any-
thing? While I’m at it, why don’t I symbolically buy a gun to 
symbolically blow my brains out?
Don’t you guys remember I already hate you for forc-
ing the World Wrestling Federation to change its name? Let 
me enjoy my fantasy world, unless you decide to sell me an abused basilisk, the most bad-ass ward against Horcruxes. 
Otherwise, let me watch my movies in peace.Oh, I guess you shouldn’t read this article if you wish 
to read Harry Potter in the future and still haven’t. Maybe I should have posted a spoiler alert. In that case, though, you 
better avoid all media for the next month or so.
Or maybe just get your act together. Spoiler alert: People 
are assholes. Get used to it.

Student offers tips for UF
I’m a senior who is graduating 
this August, and I’m not hatin’, 
but I’ve had four fantastic years of Gainesville college debauchery and can offer a few recommendations 
to keep the town prospering in all 
social aspects. I’ve noted some laws that want to curb the incurable, some changes that try to break the unbreakable and some traditions that need to be awoken from their sober deaths.  
My first complaint: Why the heck 
is UF’s campus entirely Pepsi prod-
ucts? I hate Pepsi, my roommate 
hates it, my neighbor hates it, my T.A. hates it, my slampiece hates it, the Preview kids over there hate it, and I think Albert and Alberta hate it. I don’t care what financial obli-gations UF has and what contracts were signed, I just want to be able to get something better than a cup of 
brown piss to mix with the booze I 
snuck into the Swamp on gameday.
Also, what happened to the un-
containable rowdiness that existed on the old UF gamedays?  Things like anti-campus beer pong laws and North Korea-like ways of con-trolling the student section are really harshing on my football mellow. 
Stop arresting innocent near-alco-
holics when it’s the most religious day of the week in the fall!
Further, I absolutely loathe the 
ticket system, seating delegations and especially that gremlin behind me who constantly asks me to “sit down.” Seating should be first come, first served, like it is at other 
SEC schools. The intoxicated soror -
ity girls can arrive late first quarter, 
face away from the field to take their hand-on-hip posed pictures and then can go on their way. Mean-while, the genuine sports fanatics will take the good seats to see what Coach Boom has to offer.
I hope I have left you with some 
things to think about. Just remem-ber: Work hard, and play harder. See you at happy hour.
Jonathan Martin
4LSLetter to the Editor
I’ve been back from Vietnam for seven years. I spent the first three 
in a drunken New Orleans haze. The next four, I drove for Hoffa’s Teamsters. 
Almost 30, I decide to utilize the GI Bill. Besides school, I tend a bar 
in Queens. I’ve got dream shifts. The regular barman wants weekends 
off. I earn more in two nights than he does the rest of the week.
Weekends are action nights in more ways than one. 
n n n
One early Saturday night in June, I’ve got three customers left from 
the day shift. A heavyset guy plants himself in the center of the horse-
shoe bar and orders a martini. I glance out the window and notice two guys in a double-parked car. 
Northern Boulevard’s a major thoroughfare, not where anyone 
would usually double-park.   
Besides, Queens, as is all of New York, is edgy about “Son of Sam,” 
the .44-caliber killer. Two weeks ago, he shot Stacy Moskowitz outside a disco only a mile east from where I’m working. 
I’m eyeballing the double-parked car, but I’m not spooked — yet. I count my register. The car’s still there with the driver at the wheel. 
The motor is running. 
The man from the passenger seat enters the bar.    
This is a hold-up.  
He floats in, grabs a stool just inside the door and orders a draft. I 
pour his beer. 
Then, I spot his partner heading toward my door. He’s left the car 
running.    
When this guy enters, he ignores his partner. He heads to the op-
posite side of the bar and takes the stool farthest from the front door. Resigned to my fate, I await the inevitable.   
That’s when the sonofabitch pulls the gun. I’m not playing hero to 
prevent a $500 score, so I reach for the cash.  
The gunman’s partner stands too, but his hand holds an open wal-
let. Attached to the wallet is a gold badge.
“Police,” he says. “Everyone stay calm.”The two of them head for the center of the bar. They frisk the heavy-
set guy drinking the martini and then haul him to the back room. 
I seize the Jameson bottle and pour four-fingers. As the whiskey 
finds its mark, it musters my moxie. I charge into the back room.
“Why didn’t you flash your badge earlier?” I say. “Jesus, you 
scared the shit out of me.” 
“We’ve a procedure to follow,” the detective says. “We’ve tailed 
this guy for three hours and need to ask him a few questions. Go back behind the bar. Let us do our job.”    
I return to the bottle of Jameson. The bar is empty . The few lingerers fled. Saturday night, I’m on 
duty two hours and haven’t rung up shit. To make matters worse, it’s teeming rain. I can barely make out the detective’s double-parked car 
because of the sheets of water pounding against the glass. Squinting, I 
wipe the pane with my forearm and just stare at the deluge. 
“This is going to be some crummy night,” I think to myself. “I’m 
not making a buck tonight.”
An hour later, the two cops finish. They come back to the bar area 
and apologize for causing a commotion, 
“Just doing our jobs,” they say . “He fits the description of the 
.44-caliber-killer, but he’s got an alibi. He checks out okay .” 
They head for the door. The guy they hassled returns to his wa-
tered down martini.“Wait a minute,” I blurt. “You’re not leav-
ing this guy here?”
“Yeah, we got nothing on him,” the larger 
detective says. “Have a good night.”
Is he kidding? I’m half shit-faced. I don’t 
have dollar one in the register, and it’s 9 p.m. 
I start wiping down glasses trying to decide how I’m going to handle this guy . Should I bully him or treat him with kid’s gloves? 
One thing’s sure: I want him gone. 
While I’m deliberating, my customer sips the diluted martini. Nei-
ther of us utters a word. After an eternity of silence, he says wistfully ,  “Thank God I didn’t have the gun.”   
“What? What did you say?”
I take his drink and toss it down the sink.
“Get the f**k out of here, asshole. We’re closed for the night.” He’s motionless for what seems like a month. Finally he stands and 
mercifully walks into the rain.  
I shift into high gear. I’m outing lights, counting cash and locking 
doors simultaneously. I’m vibrating like a cocktail shaker. I can’t be-lieve that guy — “Thank God I didn’t have the gun.” 
What if he’s got one stashed?  What if the cops made a mistake?  
I’m leaving here fast. 
I need a drink, and I know just the place: a five-block strip nick-
named “Booze Boulevard.” I know six bartenders who work that strip, and two of them are like my brothers.  
n n n
“Kevin, give everyone a drink. Give me a bottle of Heineken, a 
double shot of Jameson and $200 out of the register.” 
This starts my night. I’ll repeat this sentence when I stop at Black 
Mike’s to see Buffalo. Four hundred should be enough for the night. I’m in the business, so every bar I drink in it’s customary to “set the table.” 
Buying drinks for potential customers builds up business. I want 
everyone to know my name and where I work. Good will pays ever -
lasting dividends. So I buy a round of drinks, introduce myself and tell the recipients where I work. 
The bartender plants the cocktail and says, “This drink’s on Billy . 
He tends bar at Kelly’s.” 
Everybody wins. The joint makes money .  The bartender owes me 
a stop, and I get drunk and meet women. 
Tonight, the fishing’s not extraordinary . But the girls I’m interested 
in bite on cash, and I’m using plenty of bait.   
My plan’s successful. At 5 a.m. I’m in a parked car grappling with a 
lipstick-smeared enthusiast. I’m only two blocks from the scene of Son 
of Sam’s last murder.  One thing leads to another and the inevitable 
takes place. 
As she puts her head in my lap, I lie back. But despite the anesthe-
tizing effects of the alcohol, I get a sudden foreboding. Earlier in the night, I was sober and terrified of the crazed killer, but now my belly’s full of whiskey and the prisoner inside my pants has pulled a coup. 
So two short blocks from Elephas, during the “Summer of Sam,” 
I’m “taking a shot,” hopefully not from the barrel of a .44 Magnum.

A Redneck’s Swan Dive 
A contestant for the best mud pit belly flop takes his chances with a not-so-elegant swan 
dive at the 2011 Summer Redneck Games in East Dublin, Ga., on Saturday evening. The contestants were chosen based on ticket stubs, and winners received a trophy.

A new UF enrollment model will be doing 
away with the summertime farewell, “See you 
in September.” 
The Innovation Academy, scheduled to be-
gin spring 2013, is a pilot program in which students attend classes only during the spring and summer terms for the entirety of their col-lege careers at UF.
The program’s goal is to maximize the uni-
versity’s capacity during the spring and sum-mer terms as well as to increase the use of un-derutilized resources while reducing crowds 
during the fall, UF spokesman Steve Orlando 
said. 
All requirements for academic programs 
within the Innovation Academy will remain the same as the rest of the university. 
Orlando said students who choose this 
track will receive the same quality of educa-tion as any other student who is regularly en-rolled at UF.
“We’re really breaking the ground with 
this because nobody has ever tried it before,” he said.
Orlando said the two biggest advantages 
of the program are the ability to maximize the use of resources, such as building space, and to increase access to students.
There’s no reason universities can’t run at 
full capacity all year, Orlando said.  
UF Provost Joe Glover said other institu-
tions in Florida and outside the state have ex-pressed interest in the program.
Innovation Academy students will be able 
to receive Bright Futures during summer terms, which is not available to current stu-dents.
Although the admissions department is still 
deciding on a number, Glover said he believes 500 to 800 freshmen and transfer students will be admitted in the first group.
Eventually, there will be a broad selection 
of majors available to Innovation Academy students. Glover said the list of majors should be complete by mid-August. UF plans for first class of spring-summer students

UF and Florida State University 
are putting aside their differences and teaming up to digitize the na-
tion’s biological data.
The National Science Foundation 
awarded a five-year, $10-million 
grant to both schools for the project. The grant is part of the foundation’s Advancing Digitization of Biologi-cal Collections program.
The two schools will coordinate 
92 institutions in 45 states to make 
biological data available online.
According to UF officials, the 
data gathered could help govern-
ment agencies and others make de-cisions related to biological issues such as biodiversity and climate change.
U.S. institutions hold about one 
billion physical specimens, said 
Larry Page, the project’s lead princi-
pal investigator. Page estimated less than 10 percent of that information is available online.
Page said the grant will help in-
crease the rate of digitization, which is already occurring at institutions 
like the Florida Museum of Natu-
ral History. Many institutions only have pictures and records available on-site.
The National Science Foundation 
also awarded $10 million per year for the next 10 years to the other in-stitutions participating in the effort, Page said. These institutions include 
colleges, universities and museums 
not affiliated with schools.
The Florida Museum of Natural 
History staff put together the pro-posal at the end of 2010.
Four of the five principal investi-
gators are at UF, and the other is at FSU. Page said UF will coordinate the overall activities of other insti-
tutions to keep the project running 
efficiently . Of the $10 million grant to the two schools, UF will receive $7.2 million.
Page said UF’s principal inves-
tigators will form research teams based on how their information will be digitized. Researchers work-ing with insects will digitize their 
information differently than plant 
researchers, for example.UF to get $7.2M to put

Whether it’s Steve Spurrier 
screaming at his quarterbacks 
or Urban Meyer fawning 
over Florida’s punt coverage, nearly every college coach is remembered for the pet proj-ect they took on during their 
tenure.
For current UF coach Will 
Muschamp, it may very well 
be the secondary.
The 1994 Georgia grad 
played safety all four years with the Bulldogs.
Once Muschamp made his 
break into coaching, he con-
tinued to oversee the position 
he excelled at.In 2008 at Texas, Mus-
champ took over as defensive coordinator and inherited 
a porous defense which al-
lowed a school record 4,498 total yards — 3,306 of those 
in the air —  just a year prior.
But despite starting two 
freshmen safeties, Mus-
champ’s  system paid instant divi-
dends as the 
L o n g h o r n s 
led the Big 12 in defen-sive scoring 
and total 
defense. 
In his first year with the 
Gators, Muschamp will face a similarly daunting task 
following major personnel losses to Florida’s defensive backs this offseason.

Jenkins, Black? 
If you weren’t in front of the tele-
vision watching the United States play Brazil on Saturday, I feel sorry 
for you. The women wearing the red, white and blue showed incredible re-solve in one of the most epic comebacks the sport has ever seen. 
But while all the attention is on 
Megan Rapinoe’s majestic cross and former Gator Abby Wambach’s time-ly finish, the U.S. really owes it all to someone who was cast aside, benched 
and dismissed just four years ago. 
Hope Solo, the USA goalkeeper, 
kept it real in 2007 when she was un-
justifiably benched before the semifinal 
against Brazil. After the creators of the 
beautiful game dropped a four-spot on Briana Scurry, Solo spoke out. 
She criticized 
then-coach Greg Ryan for his deci-sion and said she would have, un-
doubtedly, made 
the saves that Scurry missed. 
Ryan kicked her off the team. She wasn’t allowed to attend or participate 
in the third-place game or the sub-
sequent awards ceremony. She even had to book her own flight back from China. I’m gonna let you finish 
Wambach, but U.S. rides Solo By BRYAN HOLT

For 150 of high school football’s most 
elite athletes, last week was filled with 
copious amounts of free Nike swag, in-
tense competition and tutelage from an array of NFL players.
“The Opening,” an invitation-only 
showcase, stretched from July 5-9 at 
Nike World Headquarters in Beaverton, 
Ore., and gave high school football a na-tional television spotlight. 
Included in the field were three play-
ers who have orally committed to UF: Boynton Beach High offensive tackle Jessamen Dunker, Citra North Marion High wide receiver Latroy Pittman and 
Stephenson High (Ga.) running back 
Mike Davis. 
“It felt great [to be invited],” Dunk-er said. “It was an honor, definitely. It 
was a great experience to help me find 
out what I need to work on and every-thing.”
For the athletes, their time in Beaver -
ton began with the Nike SPARQ (speed, power, agility, reaction, quickness) Rat-
ing National Champi-onship. 
The event used the 
combination of scores in the vertical leap, agility shuttle, power -
ball toss and 40-yard dash to name a top 
athlete. The title went to Geismar, La., 
safety Landon Collins, who also went on to win MVP of the event’s 7-on-7 tour -
nament and holds offers from Alabama, Florida and LSU.

Pittman, Dunker court top recruits at showcase
the weight he is carrying is really un-
believable,” Davis said of the six-foot, 199-pound Collins.
  Davis, at 5-foot-9, 192-pounds, ﬁ  n-
ished just outside the ﬁ  nals of the SPARQ competition, landing in 14th af-ter admitting he had no idea what the 
competition was before arriving at “The 
Opening.”
  Pittman, who ran a 4.64 40-yard dash 
and ﬁ  nished 68th, brushed off the im-portance of the combine.
  “I was never a big fan of the test-
ing stuff,” he said. “You have to show you’re an athlete on the ﬁ  eld.”
  Players were coached in SPARQ 
events by guys like Jerry Rice, Ray Rice and former Gators cornerback Joe Ha-den.
  Meanwhile, linemen like Dunker 
worked on their technique in the trench-
es with San Francisco 49ers offensive 
tackle Alex Boone and Detroit Lions de-fensive tackle Ndamukong Suh.
  “When we were working on pass 
protection, [Boone] was telling me I was turning my hips a little,” Dunker said. 
“He was basically telling me to keep 
my hips square and meet the defensive lineman at one point. … [Suh] was basi-
cally telling us if a defensive player is 
doing this, you do this. So I liked that.”
  For the skill position players, Friday 
and Saturday brought an opportunity to 
display their game skills. 
Coached by Arizona Cardinals cor-
nerback Patrick Peterson, Davis’ Vapor 
Carbon team went undefeated before losing in the championship game to 
Alpha Talon — a squad led by Tampa 
Berkeley Prep athlete Nelson Agholor 
and Melbourne Holy Trinity safety Mar-cus Maye, who was named to the Nike 7ON All-Tourney team.
  Pittman said he felt like his perfor-
mance with his Superbad squad showed 
he is “pretty much there” with the top 
guys in the nation. 
With two touchdowns on the week-
end, Davis seemed a little more conﬁ  -dent.
  “I believe I put it out there that I’m 
the best in the country,” the running back said.
  Florida’s oral commits attended “The 
Opening” not just as participants but also as recruiters. 
  “The coaches from UF wanted me to 
go out there and recruit people,” said Dunker, who did not compete in Sat-
urday’s lineman challenge because of a 
bruised hand. “They had me and Latroy Pittman out 
there. We were recruiting everybody.”
  Davis said he particularly targeted 
Maye and Miramar High cornerback 
Tracy Howard. 
  “I was telling them every day while I 
was there ‘You know, any day you want 
to commit to Florida, it would be nice,’” he said.
  Both Davis and Pittman said Maye 
should be a lock for the Gators while Howard feels Miami is “on the rise.”
  Pittman said Maye could orally com-
mit to UF at Friday Night Lights on July 22 and also added an interesting twist in the less-documented courting of ﬁ  ve-star speedster Agholor.
  “Nelson told me if Maye will commit 
[to the Gators], he will commit [to the Gators],” Pittman said. RECRUIT , from page 14
  But all of her actions are now vin-
dicated. Solo has shown she is the best 
keeper in the world, and it was her save 
during penalty kicks — not Wambach’s 
header in the 122nd minute — that ulti-mately clinched the game.
  Two more wins and this team will en-
ter into the history books alongside the heralded ’99 squad — thanks to Solo. 
    Quick hits from the world of sports: 
My heart goes out to Texas Rangers left 
ﬁ  elder Josh Hamilton. The man already 
had plenty of demons from his past and now must deal with feeling culpable for the horrible accident that took ﬁ  reﬁ  ght-
er Shannon Stone’s life. But the blame 
is certainly not on Hamilton. It’s on the Rangers organization for allowing such a death trap to exist, especially after a similar incident occurred in the upper 
deck just over a year ago. … Roger Cle-
mens’ trial on charges of lying to Con-gress about using performance-enhanc-ing drugs is getting underway this week. 
He faces six felony counts and could po-
tentially face more jail time than Casey Anthony. Way to go, America. … Tiger Woods made an announcement Sunday night that he would make an announce-
ment on Monday. Rumors swirled, 
speculation ensued, but all the hoopla was about an agency switch. That’s it. Go ahead and call it, golf is dead. … 
An Ohio State recruit, Kyle Kalis, who 
decommitted late last month after the much-publicized scandal, has commit-ted to Michigan. Guess the news that Mike Vrabel is coming to save the day didn’t mean much to OSU’s only ES-
PNU 150 2012 commit. … News out of 
Oregon today is that the Ducks plan to hire a full-time investigator to weed out the negative relationships between ath-letes and agents that helped lead to the 
school’s current NCAA investigation. 
While this seems like a great idea on the surface, it’s just a save-face move from one of the savviest athletic departments 
in the country. Cheating is as much a 
part of college football as tackling and touchdowns. … And in the bonehead move of the week, the fan who caught Derek Jeter’s 3,000th hit — a home run 
to left ﬁ  eld bleachers — gave the ball 
back to the Yankee shortstop free of 
charge. Seriously.

Stanford was nearly decimated this offseason 
with the NFL courting head coach Jim Harbaugh and 2010 Heisman Trophy runner-up Andrew Luck. While Harbaugh bolted for the San Francisco 49ers, Luck decided to stay put for his senior year despite many tagging him as a possible No. 1 overall draft choice. The Cardinal are coming off their best season since 1940, winning 12 games. Stanford capped off its one-loss season with a 40-12 throttling of Virginia Tech in the Orange Bowl. But with three starters off the offensive line and Luck’s top two receiver targets gone, 
promoted offensive coordinator David Shaw 
will have to ﬁ  nd a way to make Stanford’s 
offense click in his ﬁ  rst year as head coach in

After waiting on Bobby Bowden to retire for two 
seasons, it didn’t take former coach-in-waiting 
Jimbo Fisher long to rack up wins for the Seminoles 
faithful. Fisher’s 10 victories last season were a school record for a ﬁ  rst year  FSU coach and 2011 looks like it could be more of the same. Added with 
Rivals.com’s No. 2 rated recruiting class, the Semi-
noles return 16 starters. FSU will have to replace quarterback Christian Ponder after he was drafted 
by the Minnesota Vikings with the 12th overall pick 
in the 2011 NFL Draft. However, junior signal-caller 
E.J. Manuel heads into the starting job with plenty 
of experience, registering 17 appearances over the last two seasons for the oft-injured Ponder. On defense, senior inside linebacker Nigel Bradham returns as the team’s leader in tackles and looks to improve upon Florida State’s 40th ranked squad in total yards allowed. 2011 Outlook

John Boothe and Jesse Morgan and Rosa Taveras / Alligator StaffUF ranked ninth in total yards, 13th in passing yards allowed in ‘10
in tackles and interceptions, graduated. 
The enigmatic Will Hill, who struggled mightily as a 
junior but still finished with 54 tackles and two intercep-
tions, left the Gators as an undrafted free agent. 
Then in late April, Florida’s secondary took its biggest 
hit with the dismissal and transfer of All-American cor -
nerback Janoris Jenkins — who most rate as college foot-
ball’s top NFL prospect at the position.
In the wake of these departures, it’s up to Muschamp 
and newly-minted defensive backs coach Travaris Rob-
inson to try and improve upon a group that was solid in 2010.
With the trio of Black, Hill and Jenkins prowling the 
secondary, UF’s defense ranked ninth in the nation in to-tal yards and 13th in passing yards allowed.  
This season, a wealth of Meyer-era talent looks to step 
into the roles of consistent starters, but they may not be 
the type of player Muschamp prefers for his defense.
While defensive playmakers like Matt 
Elam — a sophomore safety and 2011 Jim 
Thorpe Award candidate — and junior 
corner Jeremy Brown (3 interceptions, 5 pass breakups) look to be locks for play-
ing time, incoming recruits and current underclassmen may see limited roles 
once Muschamp gets to recruit his brand 
of secondary players.
While Meyer preferred speed over size; at Texas, Mus-
champ was renowned for utilizing tall, physical corner -
backs.Last season, Muschamp had five players six-foot or 
above at the position.
However, only 6-foot-3 redshirt senior Moses Jenkins 
currently hits the mark on Florida’s roster.
Despite missing the ideal players for the Gators’ new 
defense, sophomores Cody Riggs and Joshua Shaw and 
freshman De’Ante Saunders could have time to grow in a potential down year for Southeastern Conference quarter -
backs and receivers. 
Seven of the SEC’s 10 leaders in receptions per game 
last year — including stars A.J. Green, Julio Jones and 
Randall Cobb — were either drafted or ran out of eligibil-
ity.
But Florida’s current crop of cornerbacks and safeties 
will still have to perform well to sustain Muschamp’s ex-ceeding expectations for the position. FOOTBALL , from page 14
