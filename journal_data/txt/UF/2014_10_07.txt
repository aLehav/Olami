SANTA FESTAFF REPORT
When Florida football coach Will Muschamp met with re-
porters on Sept. 24, a question about player discipline arose.
Throughout the offseason, the fourth-year head coach had 
just one player involved in legal trouble — true freshman cor-
nerback Jalen Tabor, who was cited for marijuana possession of less than 20 grams in May.
“I just think it’s a daily education for your team to under-
stand, No. 1, there’s consequences in our program for when a young man makes a poor decision. It doesn’t mean he’s a bad person, but there are consequences. They understand that,” Muschamp said. “But I think that we do some things in the offseason — and during the season as well as far as what we 
call beyond football — as far as educating our players on the  
decisions they make affects them for the rest of their life.”
But another incident surfaced Monday — 
one of a much greater magnitude.
UF true freshman Treon Harris is being 
investigated for alleged sexual battery of a female student on Florida’s campus Sunday morning. He has been suspended from the Florida football team, UF announced in a 
statement released Monday afternoon.
The team was informed Monday morn-
ing via text message of Harris’ suspension and was told they 
will be addressed about the matter at practice.
The University of Florida Police Department’s crime log 
showed that a sexual battery case occurred at UF’s Springs Res-idential Complex between 2:30 a.m. and 3:25 a.m. on Sunday, but did not identify who was charged in the case.
Maj. Brad Barber, UPD public information ofﬁ  cer, con-
ﬁ  rmed Monday afternoon that the case at Springs is the one involving Harris. 
“The victim did not report assault until early Monday morn-
ing,” Barber said.
UF spokeswoman Janine Sikes, who also conﬁ  rmed the 
incident at Springs involved Harris, declined to comment on 
Harris’ whereabouts or where he lives on campus.
A source who lives “just a few doors away” from Har-
ris conﬁ  rmed to the Alligator that Harris does indeed live at Springs. A separate source conﬁ  rmed the victim in question 
also lives in Springs.
There was a heavy police presence inside the Springs Com-
plex Monday morning, with police questioning residents on Harris’ ﬂ  oor and a security guard as well the head of his ﬂ  oor stationed outside his room most of the morning.
According to the second source, who is not an eyewitness but is close to the team, Harris allegedly forced himself into the 
victim’s room and allegedly sexually assaulted her there. The 
source also said the victim has a roommate, but it is unknown if she was in the residence hall at the time of the alleged assault. Even if she was, per the source, it is not uncommon to be un-
able to hear what is happening in another room based on how 
the Springs Complex’s suites are built — a bathroom separates rooms.
According to a release, the Gainesville Police Department 
was asked by UPD to collect potential items of forensic evi-

A man grabs his girlfriend around 
the neck, puts her head under the 
bathtub’s faucet and threatens to turn it on. He holds the woman’s cellphone in his hand, convinced 
she is talking to other men. In actual-
ity, he cheated on her and frequently abused her. 
She breaks up with him, cuts off 
all contact and moves far away. But she never reported what her ex-boy-friend did to her.
This story belongs to a friend of 
Brenna Belcher, a 19-year-old engi-neering student at Santa Fe College. 
Belcher said she wished her 
friend had reported her perpetra-tor. The relationship was a “vicious cycle” — the boyfriend would abuse her friend and be nice immediately after, she said.
Experiences like that were ad-
dressed at a Santa Fe College event Monday to raise awareness about domestic violence against women and men as part of Domestic Vio-lence Awareness Month. Students made T-shirts, and a conference was held on campus to show support for domestic abuse victims.
The conference was hosted by 
Student Life at Santa Fe and consist-ed of eight speakers, each from dif-ferent organizations aimed at sup-
porting and helping domestic abuse 
victims and perpetrators. Santa Fe’s Police Chief Ed Brook was also there to speak.
Teresa Drake, Director of the In-
timate Partner Violence Assistance Clinic, said “one in every three wom-en in this country will face domestic violence.” This means in a room with more than a dozen women, it’s likely that three of them are victims of domestic abuse, she said.
As Bruce Ferris, a Licensed Men-
tal Health Counselor at the Village Counseling Center of Gainesville, later said, domestic abuse involves more than just battery — power and control are also big factors.

Our Robotic Future: A Talk By 
Evan SelingerEvan Selinger from the Rochester Institute of Technology will explore how Americans are increasingly 
outsourcing intimate emo-
tional labor to service provid-ers like elder caretakers, love coaches and wedding plan-ners as well as tools like smart phones and self-driving cars. He will question the prob-lematic and tragic results of this reliance such as distorted 
family values and declining 
civic life. As we become in-creasingly dependent upon electronic devices, we may fall into what Selinger terms the “outsourcing illusion,” or be-coming submissive to technol-ogies instead of using them to improve our lives. His lecture 
will take place in Smathers 
Library, Room 1A at 5:30 p.m. on Monday.

The Elections Commission Committee met 
Monday morning to rule on the two com-
plaints filed by the UF Supervisor of Elections Hans Rojas during last week’s elections.
Rojas filed complaints against the Swamp 
Party and independent District B candidate Evan Morris because they failed to submit fi-nancial statements before the set deadline.
According to Student Government election 
codes, financial reports from all parties and candidates are due every Monday after the Sept. 10 mandatory meeting for all qualified candidates until the Monday following elec-
tions as well as the Tuesday, Wednesday and 
Thursday of the elections.
Swamp Party failed to submit a form on 
Sept. 29.
Swamp Party President Ricky Salabarria 
said the financial form he received at the man-
datory meeting had a different date. The date 
listed was Sept. 30, not Sept. 29.
Rojas didn’t change the date on the tem-plate used from last Fall. Rojas said that the 
correct dates were listed on the SG website 
and on the PowerPoint presentation that Rojas gave to the parties.
“I didn’t think I would have to cross refer-
ence with the date sheet,” Salabarria said.
The committee unanimously agreed that 
the Swamp Party did violate the code. The committee ruled that Swamp has two weeks to turn in the financial statement from Sept. 
29 for public records purposes or face another 
hearing.
Salabarria said the party would turn in its 
forms later that afternoon.
Morris said he did not know that a form had to be submitted every day during elec-
tion week because he missed the mandatory 
meeting for election candidates because of an internship. He failed to turn in a financial statement on Sept. 30.
“I will openly admit that I did commit a 
violation. I did not turn in the sheet on time,” Morris said. The 20-year-old UF marketing ju-nior lost in the election.
Rojas said Morris submitted the forms the 
next day after he realized his mistake.
The committee unanimously ruled that 
Morris did violate the code, but it ruled for no punishment against Morris because he turned in his paperwork even after the deadline.UF Elections Commission addresses election complaints� IT’S NOW $26,000.

UF postdoctoral students will 
have extra pocket change next 
month.
Joe Glover, provost and senior 
vice president for academic affairs, 
announced that UF increased the 
minimum salary for postdoctoral associates for the 2014-2015 year.
Full-time postdoc students 
spending nine months at UF will make $26,000 this year compared to the $22,000 they made in 2013-2014. The adjusted salary will be reflected in Oct. 31 paychecks.
Kim M. Kitagawa Pace, an assis-
tant provost and director of the of-fice of postdoctoral affairs, said this is the second year the university set a minimum wage for postdocs.
Pace said the university estab-
lished a minimum salary for all postdoc associates to be no less than the minimum salary estab-lished for graduate students.
“Postdocs are a very unique cat-
egory of folks on campus that have their Ph.D.,” she said.
The university has about 550 
postdoc employees on campus, 
Pace said.
Michael McCourt has enjoyed 
working as a research assistant for the past year because he can con-
tinue to work on the same research he worked on as a grad student.
“I think in general they are 
slightly underpaid for their skill set, and the raise is appropriate,” 
the 30-year-old UF mechanical 
aerospace engineering assistant said. UF raises minimum salary

UF marketing juniorSome often wonder why victims in abusive relationships 
don’t leave, and Alachua County’s Bureau Chief for Trauma 
Intervention Laura Knudson explained it’s often difficult.
“When you become so isolated, so alone ... it is hard to get 
out of relationships,” Knudson said.
Ferris said other domestic violence factors can include 
low self-esteem and the misguided belief that the abuse is normal and OK.
“There is a lot of blaming of our victims and survivors,” 
Ferris said. 
He said there is a dynamic of why survivors stay. “Just because (the victim) stayed doesn’t mean it’s (his or 
her) fault.”

The event will be streamed live

He said pro-

message.
Applebaum, a 21-year-old UF

Some copycat confusion ensued Sunday 
when a blog post on Ken Eats Gainesville 
alerted residents that Gainesville’s upcom-
ing Shila Korean BBQ restaurant had missed 
a key element in business etiquette: If you’re going to open a restaurant, make sure it doesn’t already exist. 
In fact, its carbon-copy twin in menu, web-
site, name and logo has been open for about a year more than 2,500 miles away in Clovis, California. 
Blogger Ken Peng of “Ken Eats Gainesville” 
found the link between the two restaurants when he noticed oddities in the Gainesville Shila’s website. It looked nice at first, he said, but then he saw broken links, a scanned-in 
menu and rampant grammatical errors. 
“We look forward serving you!” it says on 
the contact page over a number that rings in-
definitely with no response. 
“I had a suspicion that they were stealing it,” Peng said, who has reviewed Gainesville 
restaurants since last year. “They weren’t be-
ing subtle about it at all.”
Peng posted on the California Shila’s Face-
book page asking if the two businesses were related.
“No. its not one of us. thanks for letting us 
know,” the business wrote back. 
When Peng posted the news on his Face-
book page, 66 people expressed their dissatis-
faction with the restaurant, many adding they 
would not attend once it opened its doors. 
“This place had disaster written on it since 
I saw the sign go up. I would be shocked to see it open! Thanks Ken!” wrote Kelly Klunk 
Thompson. 
“Must be North Korean BBQ…” Peng re-
sponded. 
However, it turned out the copycat confu-
sion was just that: a confusion.
The Gainesville location’s owner, Tao 
Zhao, said he is a cousin of the California 
Shila’s owner. 
“It’s kind of basically the same restau-
rant,” Zhao said. “They were OK with doing that.” The California Shila’s owner, who asked 
to be identified as Lee, said he learned about the restaurant when Peng called him.  
“The thing is it really doesn’t matter that 
much to me,” Lee said. “He is all the way in the East Coast.”
Lee said he didn’t know his cousin had 
chosen to create a similar restaurant at the time he responded to Peng’s Facebook post.
Zhao said the restaurant hopes to open in 
the next month at the former Stonewood lo-cation at 3812 W. Newberry Road. 
He said the process has been delayed af-
ter multiple issues with permits to set up a 
downdraft, an underground venting system, 
to create a smokeless environment.
Zhao also owns Fujiyama Japanese Steak-
house in Vero Beach and Melbourne, but de-
cided to open the Korean BBQ restaurant to 
cater to the college crowd. 
“The concept of the Korean BBQ I think is popular among young kids,” he said.
Customers will be able to cook their own 
food and choose from $13.99 lunch plates, $18.99 dinner plates or $23.99 premium din-ner plates. Groups must agree on one plate type, according to the menu, which reads 
the “whole group will be charged with same 
price selection.”
The menu also specifies that tables will 
have a 90-minute time limit, something Zhao 
said is a common all-you-can-eat restaurant 
policy. Guests will be charged for any meat that is not eaten, and take-out is not allowed. 
Children get half-off on meals, but must 
be within the 36- to 52-inch height range to 
qualify for a discount. 
“We are not going to be very strict on the 
height of the kids,” Zhao clarified. 
Copycat or not, the restrictions are putting 
a damper on the excitement for the restau-
rant’s opening. 
“I’m going to take my tall a** children 
elsewhere,” Tyler Black, owner of Amerau-cana Wood Fire Food Truck, wrote on Ken

A new website will connect the 
Gator nation from all parts of the 
world.
For the past few months, the UF 
Alumni Association has worked to create a website called Gator Treks 
where former and current UF stu-
dents can come and share their travel stories.
“Our goal is to bring together 
the entire Gator Nation through the love of travel,” said Jason Elliott, the manager for Gator Treks. 
Elliott said the website will be up and running before 2015 but en-courages people to sign up for early access on the Gator Treks website. 
“The alumni association is trying 
to engage the entire community,” Elliot said. “It’s not like Facebook. 
It’s for the entire Gator Nation.” 
The website will be free, but will 
be monitored so there is no inap-
propriate content uploaded.
“We are family friendly, so we 
don’t want obscene stories,” Elliot said.
Study-abroad students are en-
couraged to share their traveling 
experiences, he said.
Dragana Bilic,19, said she would 
upload her travel photos from Eu-
rope for other Gators to see.
“It’s a pretty cool idea to post 
pictures for Gators to see and share your story,” the UF marketing sophomore said. “I have a lot of pictures, and I would be willing to 
upload them.” 
Bilic has traveled to and around 
Europe. 
“The only place I’ve really been 
to was a few years (ago), and I went 
to Venice, Italy with my dance group, and the only other place I’ve been to is Serbia,” she said.Gator Treks to connect world UF alumni“I had a suspicion that they were

Kaleigh Clarke grew up eating pea-
nut butter and jelly sandwiches. They 
were her favorite until she developed a severe airborne peanut allergy.  
Clarke, a 20-year-old UF psychol-
ogy sophomore, may find herself eating peanut-based products without having a reaction in the near future thanks to the advancements made by Wade Yang, a UF scientist and assistant professor in the department of food science and hu-man nutrition.
Yang is researching ways to remove 
allergens from peanuts so allergy suffer-
ers can eat them without a reaction. 
Yang is a little bit closer to his goal of 
eliminating 99.9 percent of allergens, ac-
cording to a UF press release.
For 95 percent of those with peanut 
allergies to safely consume them, Yang and his researchers must reduce the al-lergens from 150 milligrams to less than 1.5 milligrams of protein per peanut. 
Yang is working to remove the aller-gens while keeping the peanut’s same taste, flavor, texture and nutrition. 
The latest advances in his study fea-
ture the application of ultraviolet tech-nology to whole peanuts. 
“There are a lot of benefits (to eating 
peanuts),” Yang said. “It’s over 25 per-cent protein. It’s a good source of plant-based protein for people.”
To date, the research project has cost

His current findings will be pub-
lished in the journal “Food and Biopro-cess Technology,” according to the UF press release. Yang’s next steps include finding other researchers with whom to collaborate on human clinical trials and seeking more funding for his research.
Yang’s research could allow Clarke to 
eat her favorite childhood snack without going into anaphylactic shock.
“It would make a lot of people’s life 
easier,” she said. “It’s definitely some-thing worth trying because you defi-

The introduction of the new e-
Learning site, Canvas, has UF fac-
ulty members struggling to upload student grades.
Annelie Schmittel, a graduate 
student in mass communications in the College of Journalism and Com-munications, said the Canvas pro-gram is not user friendly to faculty 
and staff.
As a Sports Media and Society 
teaching assistant, she sought help 
with the e-Learning Support Ser-vices desk at the HUB.
“Typically, you would upload 
Scantron grades through Sakai,” she said. “With Canvas, it’s different because the Excel files we use aren’t 
working properly. Several steps 
have to be taken before inserting any grade.”
Schmittel said it is frustrating to work with a new system when the previous one, Sakai, was an easier 
process.
In the Spring, all faculty and stu-
dents will use the Canvas program 
as it replaces Sakai.
Tracy Gale, communications 
manager for UF Information Tech-nology, said she had not previously heard of faculty experiencing diffi-
culty with the website.
“The e-Learning staff always 
have a staff member at the help 
desk,” she said. “There are several people that are course management liaisons that help faculty receive the help they need.”
The e-Learning staff has also 
developed training for developing 
courses in Canvas, as well as a cam-
pus boot camp for faculty to learn the new system.
Mark McCallister, associate di-rector of the Office of Academic Technology, wrote in an email that 
uploading grades with Scantron to 
Canvas is a different process than uploading grades from Scantron to Sakai.
“If a faculty member experiences 
difficulty, they should contact the UF Computing Help Desk,” he wrote.
Schmittel, who has contacted the 
e-Learning management liaisons, 
said the problems will continue oc-
curring until Scantron and the Can-vas creators work together to solve the problem.

UF physical therapy student Scott 
Venkataraman screened Gainesville 
residents’ blood pressure and heart rate at a health event Monday. 
The 23-year-old second-year UF 
graduate student took part in the Walktober event along with about 10 physical therapy students at the Fred Cone Park located at 2841 E. University Ave. 
Walktober, a free six-week health 
program, is getting the Gainesville community active until Nov. 10 to promote healthy living. 
Each week during the Monday 
Wellness Walks, volunteers will promote healthy living with the purpose of educating residents and preventing future health issues. 
This is the first year Walktober is 
being hosted by the Alachua Coun-ty Health Department, the Gaitor Challenge, a UF physical therapy 
community health initiative, and 
Combatting Obesity for Alachua County’s Health. 
“I think the opportunity to walk 
or to exercise has immense benefits for health, both for the prevention of problems but also for general well-being,” said Kim Dunleavy, head of community outreach for the Gaitor Challenge REACH group.
Gainesville resident Marie Ford 
is participating in Walktober not 
only for her own health but for her 
daughter’s.
“I’m trying to get her to exercise 
more too, to get her away from the games and television,” she said. “I just want her to be a little bit more active, and if I start her out young, maybe it’ll motivate her to want to stay fit.”
UF physical therapy students 
will continue to educate and encour-age residents at Fred Cone Park. 
“By being in the program and 
doing these outreach groups, it’s re-ally nice to see that we’re able to talk to the community about their health issues that we may not necessarily treat outright,” Venkataraman said. TUESDAY, OCTOBER 7, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

The UF Health Cancer Center appointed a 
new deputy director of medical affairs Mon-
day – Dr. C. Parker Gibbs.
Gibbs, who was chosen from a national 
search, will start Friday. Gibbs will head the 
clinical aspects of cancer care at UF Health 
Cancer Center at Shands.  
“My goal is to bring compassionate, cut-
ting-edge coordinated care to our patients,” 
Gibbs said.
He said his position was created to make 
navigation in the center for patients easier.
“If a patient is seen by a breast surgeon 
and has a surgery then needs radiation after-wards,” he said, “we coordinate that care so 
that the patient runs through that system in 
a seamless fashion and is not left to navigate that system on their own.”
Paul Okunieff, director of the center, said 
Gibbs easily outperformed other applicants and had the necessary leadership and experi-ence for the job.
“It’s much more than experience,” Oku-
nieff said. “It’s actually wanting to do good and actually putting his actions where his thoughts are.”
Gibbs is currently UF’s Eugene L. Jewett 
professor of orthopaedic surgery and serves 
as the College of Medicine’s division of mus-
culoskeletal oncology chief. He also directs UF’s Musculoskeletal Oncology and Stem 
Cell Laboratory.
“I’m a cancer surgeon,” Gibbs said. “I 
think they were interested in bringing sur-
gery into the cancer leadership realm.”
Gibbs graduated from 
UF with a medical degree in 1989 and completed his 
residency at the University of Colorado.
He served as the direc-
tor of musculoskeletal on-cology at the University of 
Colorado for five years be-
fore being appointed to the UF Department 
of Orthopaedics in 2003. Gibbs is also a Na-
tional Institutes of Health/National Cancer 
Institute-funded investigator with nearly 60 
published scientific papers.
Gibbs said one of the main things he wants 
to focus on at UF Health is cancer patient sur-
vival statistics and side effects.
“Cancer care is sometimes very toxic to 
the patient, and so we want to minimize side 
effects,” he said.Cancer Center appoints director

Harris accusations 
reminder of sexual 
assault problems
When news broke of Treon Harris’ investigation af-
ter being accused of sexually assaulting a woman on campus, theories and possible connections ﬂ  ew 
around the Internet and in personal conversations.
Some have connected the incident to the Jameis Winston 
rape investigation that ended without any prosecution. Some connected it to the assaults on and off the UF campus.
Although comparing the Harris incident to other high-
proﬁ  le cases of rape and sexual assaults is to be expected, such comparisons are premature and unproductive.
This is its own unique incident, with a unique alleged per-
petrator and a unique alleged victim.
Any argument saying Harris “should have known better” 
should also be ignored. Yes, Harris was in the national spot-
light, especially after his role in leading UF to victory against 
Tennessee on Saturday. Yes, the recent incidents of assault at UF and the subsequent awareness campaigns mean that all UF students — Harris included — should be more knowl-edgeable than ever about the awful nature of such acts.
However, the point is that everyone “should know better.” 
People shouldn’t need constant reminders telling them what is or isn’t OK, especially when it comes to something as seri-ous and harmful as sexual assault.
We have reached a dangerous point in American society 
when we feel the need to engage in constant education and awareness campaigns about sexual assault. The repulsiveness of this crime should be self-evident.
Many in the national media have praised UF for its prompt 
and decisive action in response to the allegations against Har-ris. UF absolutely did the right thing in responding quickly and transparently. The university’s handling of this situation compares favorably to past failures of other universities when 
dealing with sexual assault investigations.
However, the fact that UF has been singled out as a rare 
example of competence regarding the issue of sexual assault 
demonstrates how dire the situation has become.
On college campuses around the country and in American 
society in general, the issues of rape and sexual assault are still not being given the serious treatment they require. Too many are still likely to engage in victim blaming, like asking what clothes the alleged victim was wearing or how much 
alcohol they had consumed.
Already, rumors are ﬂ  ying about what motive the alleged 
victim might have had to falsely accuse Harris. Such rumors 
are completely baseless and inappropriate in the immediate aftermath of the incident.
Now that Harris has been suspended, we must wait for 
the University Police to complete what will hopefully be a thorough investigation. Whether or not Harris is ultimately 
charged or found guilty, this incident is yet another remind-
er that acts of rape and sexual assault continue to pervade American society.

Vote or post a message at www.alligator.orgMonday’s question: Are you worried 
about catching meningitis? Today’s question: Do you think UF responded well to 
the Treon Harris accusations? Everyone, stop freaking out about Ebola
After the ﬁ  rst case of the Ebola virus in the U.S. was 
diagnosed last week, many Americans were struck with a fresh wave of panic and fear.
In covering the diagnosis, the media used words like 
“alarming,” “desperate” and “frantic” to describe the cur-
rent situation in our country. Social media subsequently 
exploded with tweets and posts expressing a combination of suspicion, worry and fury.
Some people were outraged that we haven’t severely 
tightened travel restrictions or closed our borders, while others felt extremely skeptical about the ability of the Cen-ters for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. federal public health agencies, to protect us from an outbreak.
I’ve seen a number of Facebook posts from my friends 
asserting that Ebola is much more serious than our gov-ernment is telling us. Undoubtedly, many others share this view.
I understand the fears. The Ebola virus has a fatality 
rate of about 50 percent and has already killed almost 4,000 people in West Africa. Ebola is considered to be a hu-manitarian crisis that requires immediate attention from the international community.
Ebola is scary, and I certainly don’t blame anyone for 
being worried about it. However, it’s nearly impossible to have a calm and rational discussion about the issue when so many people are being misinformed.
The prominent news outlets spreading the hysteria 
about Ebola should be ashamed of themselves.
Rather than focusing on facts and evaluating the situ-
ation objectively, news programs have sensationalized Ebola simply for the sake of increasing their ratings.
Was it truly necessary for news stations to send their 
camera crews on helicopters to record the ambulance tak-ing the diagnosed man to the hospital? How do these me-dia outlets justify spending hours of news coverage dis-cussing the search for a homeless person who might have been in contact with the man?
One news commentator even accused a guest on the 
show — a reputable medical professional — of speaking too calmly about the issue.Miles O’Brien, a science jour-
nalist, recently described the ir-responsibility and foolishness of this media sensationalism. “I wish everybody could take 
a deep breath and take a break 
from trying to pull viewers in by scaring them,” he said. O’Brien added that this is a level of ig-norance “we should not allow in our media.”
Instead of acting like the 
world is ending and obsessing over the very unlikely pos-sibility that a serious Ebola outbreak will occur in the U.S., 
news outlets should simply give viewers an overview of 
the most important information.
Contrary to the implications of all the media hype, 
Ebola is relatively difﬁ  cult to contract. The virus can only be spread through direct contact with an infected person’s bodily ﬂ  uids, and an infected person does not become contagious until he or she begins developing symptoms.
You are much more likely to catch the ﬂ  u, which can 
be spread through the air and is contagious even when an 
infected individual doesn’t appear to be sick.
While it is true that Ebola has spiraled out of control 
in West Africa, that region is home to some of the world’s 
most impoverished nations. 
These countries lack basic medical infrastructure and 
do not have the proper resources to inform the public about how to prevent infection.
It is incredibly sad that Ebola is spreading in an area 
that is so ill-equipped to deal with an outbreak, but it is 
quite unrealistic to assume that the same outcome will oc-
cur in the U.S.
Hopefully, more people will learn the facts about Ebola 
before giving in to panic and paranoia. 
Fear and ignorance are contagious, too, and we must 
avoid spreading them.

Congress ended session Sept. 23, giving Amer-
icans another opportunity to evaluate their representatives before engaging in their civic 
duty at the ballot boxes this November.
Though members of Congress will spend the next 
six weeks back at their home districts to address their reelection campaigns, Americans have yet an-other opportunity to assess the elements plaguing this dysfunctional Congress.
It is no secret that Americans feel that their repre-
sentatives are not following through with their pri-mary duty: representing their citizens. A recent poll by “Rasmussen Reports” shows about 53 percent of the country’s likely voters believe that neither the Democratic nor Republican parties represent the in-terests of the American people.
The biggest issue plaguing the American politi-
cal landscape is the lack of congressional account-ability to the constituents — undoubtedly resulting from the lack of congressional term limits.
Though the lack of term limits has had a tremen-
dous impact on American democracy, conventional perspectives would commonly attribute this failure in accountability to the effect of money in politics. And with court decisions that have removed politi-cal spending limits by corporations and aggregate spending limits by people as well as immensely in-creasing the influence special interest groups can as-sert in politics, this attribution is valid.
Though campaign finance has greatly threatened 
the ability of congressmen to accurately represent their constituents and not special interest groups, the constitutionally inherent lack of term limits coupled with high incumbency rates has created a collection of career politicians more interested in reelection and staying in power than serving their constituents. This has disintegrated accountability in politics and has endangered the representation of Americans more than any campaign finance legisla-tion.
Political satisfaction rates for congressmen are at 
an all time low, with only six percent of probable voters believing their representatives are doing a good or excellent job, according to “Rasmussen Re-ports.” Yet, even with a number so low, the incum-bency rates for congressmen are at a staggering 90 percent.
Such tenacious incumbency can be explained by 
the immense advantages available to representatives that enable them to perpetually maintain offices.
These advantages include name recognition, gerrymandered districts that favor parties and, most im-portantly, the ability to raise more funds than competi-tors.
This fundraising advantage makes the chance of 
incumbents losing office implausible — a very dan-gerous reality that perpetuates a legislative body that virtually no longer needs the legitimacy or sat-isfaction of its citizens.
The lack of term limits has severely threatened 
the representation of American citizens in this dem-ocratic system. Simply stated, legislators have no accountability. 
When it is more important for congressmen to 
support the donors and special interest groups that assist them in remaining incumbents than it is to perform their legislative duty, there is virtually no necessity to represent or care about the interests of their constituents.
America needs term limit legislation right now in 
order to repair a system that enables congressmen to be virtually unaccountable to their citizens.
When congressmen are more interested in stay-
ing in power than representing their citizens, they become susceptible to corruption and the whims of special interest groups.
Not only would term limits diminish the strength 
of incumbency and the power of special inter-est groups, but it would also reorient the focus of elected officials to effecting change and enacting the platform they were voted in on instead of establish-ing an immortal career in politics. 
On top of creating a body that is more accountable 
to the citizens it represents instead of donors, term limits invigorate progress in Congress by bringing in fresh ideas, incentivizing quicker action, limiting the chance for corrupt officials and their scope of corruption and diminishing the focus on special in-terests and legacy when trying to accomplish what is important.
Though money in politics has had a devastat-
ing effect on the representation of citizens, a lack of term limits allows congressmen to be unaccount-able, making it easier to care more for pleasing spe-cial interest groups in order to establish permanent careers in Congress than to represent American citi-zens. The best way to mitigate the negative effects is to bring in term limits.

A few weeks ago, I wrote 
a column urging my fellow students to start 
reading a book that day. As a challenge to myself, I decided 
to read as much as I could in 
my spare time starting that week and see what a difference it made for me.
So far, it’s been an excel-
lent experience. I’ve succeeded in reading a little each day, whether in short bursts while on the bus across campus or in 
long stretches while I procrasti-
nate studying for my exams.
Being a literature-thirsty 
English major to my core, I’ve spent a lot of time recently devouring book reviews and reading articles about literature and its benefits to our society. Learning about the importance 
and benefits of reading makes 
me happy; it makes me sit back in my chair and say, with satis-faction, “It’s a good time to love books.”  
There are so many books to 
read and so much discussion on reading, and with the tech-nological advances of the Inter-
net, so many new ways to dis-
cover a text — whether through reading on a tablet or finding an obscure website dedicated to one particular author’s fan base. If you like to read, the time to be alive is now; we even have a vast archive of all of Shakespeare’s works neatly 
compacted into a free app for 
the iPhone.
However, in my search-
ing through the Internet for literature-related articles and opinions, I’ve noticed a disturb-ing trend that much of society seems to share: once someone gets past a certain age of ado-
lescence, there is an expectation 
put upon individuals, espe-cially college-aged students, to move past well-loved young adult books — such as fantasy series written mainly for teen audiences like “Divergent” — and instead start reading more “serious” literature.
Young adult literature and 
young adult authors are often seen as fluffy and unsubstantial. They are looked down upon as not being “real” literature that adults should waste their time reading.
This disdain for young adult 
literature is something I’ve no-
ticed happening often in life — 
the activities, goals and opin-ions of adolescents are far more likely to be dismissed than con-sidered important in the grand scheme of the world.
Despite society’s generally 
derisive view of young adult books, this genre of literature 
has a great deal to offer its read-
ers, no matter their age.
The prejudice and disrespect 
toward the genre of young adult literature is simply ignorant.
Yes, some books written for 
puberty-stricken preteens are rather shallow. Frankly, some are downright trash. However, the same can be said about any genre of literature and about any art form.
The entire genre of young 
adult literature doesn’t deserve such a bad reputation because of its mostly vampire-themed failures.
Engaging with the complex 
plot and brilliantly developed characters of author Tamora Pierce’s fantasy young adult 
series helped me learn about 
maturity and responsibility. The success of author and laud-ed “nerdfighter” John Green comes primarily not from his popular YouTube videos but from his young-adult novels, most notably “The Fault in Our Stars.” Let’s be honest: Did 
anyone not cry while reading 
the book or watching the film adaptation?
I’m not trying to compare 
books like Suzanne Collins’ “The Hunger Games” series to literary masterpieces like the works of T.S. Eliot or Virginia Woolf.
In fact, I believe it is bet-
ter not to compare them at all. Young adult literature is an en-tirely different kind of fiction from what most people con-sider “serious.” Young-adult books should be independently appreciated and celebrated, not degraded for their fundamen-
tally different intentions. In 
fact, many adults and consum-ers of traditionally “serious” literature would probably ben-efit from reading young adult literature. Most of them would probably even enjoy it.
Young adult literature is a 
voice for our generation — and 
for every generation of youth in 
history.
As college students, we 
stand in a complicated limbo between clinging to the securi-ty of our adolescence and step-ping into a fully adult world, complete with scary things like careers and health insurance 
benefits.
It’s up to us to remember the 
value of young-adult books and 
what they can continue to offer us even far down the road into our adult lives — the ferocious optimism of humanity’s youth and the fantastical thought hid-den somewhere in your mind 
that anything is possible.

A Gainesville man was arrested Sunday af-
ter police said he drank a stolen beer in a CVS 
bathroom just 12 hours after officers had issued 
him a sworn complaint for exposing his penis 
to a woman outside of the same drugstore.
At about 9:30 a.m., a store manager saw 
Randy H. Colby urinating in front of the CVS 
on 1621 SW 13th St., Gainesville Police spokes-
man Officer Ben Tobias wrote in an email. 
When the manager went outside to confront 
the 53-year-old about peeing in front of a plate glass window, Colby turned around to face the 
female employee while his penis was exposed. 
Tobias said the man made no effort to cover himself. 
Colby was inebriated and was transported 
to the hospital because of his intoxicated state, Tobias said. 
Because state law requires an officer to wit-
ness the exposure of sexual organs to make an arrest, police filed a sworn complaint against 
Colby in place of a physical arrest. The re-
sponding officer also issued Colby a trespass warning.
After being discharged from the hospital, 
Colby returned to the CVS at about 9:30 p.m., despite being issued the warning. Police said he was found in the store’s bathroom drinking a stolen $4 Natural Ice beer, a report said. 
Colby told police he was consuming the sto-
len beer in the bathroom so he did not have to pay for it. 
He was arrested on charges of petit theft and 
trespassing.

A Gainesville man was arrested for driving

Robert C. Barth, 21, was driving near 1125 
SE Fourth St. at about 6 a.m. before he was seen 
passed out in his car. The car was still in drive 
and his foot was still on the accelerator, a re-port said. A curb prevented his black Hyundai Veloster from traveling farther off the road. 
Officers found one 12-ounce can of Pabst 
Blue Ribbon and one 23.5-ounce can of fruit-punch-flavored Four Loko — both still cool to the touch, police said.
Barth performed poorly on field sobriety 
exercises and showed obvious signs of impair-
ment, including bloodshot eyes, dilated pupils 
and slurred speech, the report said. He gave breath samples of .227 and .218. The legal limit is 0.08. 
Barth was charged with DUI and released

UF scientists are using the blood 
of a rare salamander to study how 
humans might heal without scars after surgery.
The axolotl, an endangered sala-mander, can regrow lost limbs, spi-nal vertebrae and parts of its brain. Researchers are comparing healing 
in axolotls to healing in mice, hoping 
to better understand the amphib-ian’s regenerative abilities.
Ed Scott is a UF health researcher 
and professor in the UF College of Medicine department of molecular genetics and microbiology. Scott re-fers to this amphibian as the “king of regeneration.”Scientists are focusing their stud-
ies on how different species’ blood cells react to healing.
“There’s something different 
about the blood cell formation in axolotls,” said Malcolm Maden, Ph.D., a professor in the department of biology.
Usually speckled brown-green, 
the rare salamanders being used for the research have a naturally occur-ring mutation that gives them white, translucent skin. Because of this mu-tation, internal organs and blood of these salamanders are visible.
Researchers developed axolotls 
with fluorescent blood so they can study the site of regeneration in the salamanders.
Axolotls, mice and humans all 
share similar cells, but the cells be-have differently, Scott said. 
“It becomes one of those old Ho-
cus Focus comics where you have to find the differences,” Scott said. “Maybe those differences are key differences for regeneration.”
Axolotls are also unable to devel-
op cancer. Scott said that when ex-posed to carcinogens, the creatures occasionally grew extra limbs but never developed cancer.
“We’re studying a set of animals 
that can do what we would like to help people do better,” Scott said.

UF students have a chance to win front-

a campus-wide scavenger hunt. 
The University Athletic Association is host-
ing its first-ever #GatorRace from 11 a.m. to 1 
p.m on Wednesday.  Clues will be tweeted around 10:45 a.m. 
from the @GZStudents Twitter account.
After students solve each clue, they will ar-
rive at a designated location and find a person 
holding a sign that reads #GatorRace. Students will have to tweet a picture of themselves at the location with the hashtag. 
The first students to complete all six tasks 
will win tickets to the Missouri game.  
“Students are a very important part to the 
game day experience for all of our venues and we hope this scavenger hunt gives students views of areas they may never have been,” wrote Alicia Longworth, an assistant athletic director in the marketing and promotions de-partment for the UAA, in an email.The first 40 students to arrive at each loca-
tion and tweet the hashtag #GatorRace will receive small prizes.

The Supreme Court unexpectedly cleared 
the way Monday for a dramatic expansion of 
gay marriage in the U.S. and may have signaled 
that it’s only a matter of time before same-sex 
couples can marry in all 50 states.
Rejecting appeals from five states seeking to 
preserve their bans, the Supreme Court effec-
tively made such marriages legal in 30 states, 
up from 19 and the District of Columbia, taking in every region of the country.
Challenges are pending in the other 20 
states.
Almost immediately, exuberant couples 
began receiving marriage licenses previously denied to them. “This is the dream day,” said Sharon Baldwin, a plaintiff in a challenge to 
Oklahoma’s ban, as she and her partner got 
their license in the Tulsa County Clerk’s Of-fice.
Directly affected by Monday’s orders were 
Wisconsin, Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah and Vir-
ginia. Officials in those states had appealed 
lower court rulings in an effort to preserve their bans. Couples in six other states — Colo-rado, Kansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wyoming — should be able 
to get married in short order since those states 
would be bound by the same appellate rulings that have been on hold.
The justices did not explain why they de-
cided to leave that question unanswered for 
now. They may be waiting for a federal appeals 
court to break ranks with other appellate pan-els and uphold state laws defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Or they may see 
little role for themselves as one court after an-
other strikes down state marriage bans.
Still, the import seemed clear. What the justices did in virtual silence Mon-
day “has to send a signal to the other courts 
of appeals that the Supreme Court does not 
think it’s so wrong to allow same-sex couples to marry, and that even conservative justices don’t think they have a good shot at getting 
five votes. And that sends a message that this 
essentially is over,” said Jon Davidson, legal director of Lambda Legal, an advocacy group for gay rights.Court rejects appeals, clears

indeﬁ  nitely.
And with that an-
nouncement came the scrutiny of press and anyone who values morals more than foot-ball.
But in the midst of 
scandal, one athlete spoke out.
And yes, that’s very cliché sounding, but it’s 
true, and I commend Mackenzie Dagostino on making her voice heard.
The junior volleyball setter tweeted at 5:10 
p.m. on Monday a link to her blog, Whistles and School Bells. In her ﬁ  rst post, she addressed the question of why some student athletes feel they can get away with certain behaviors – and later speciﬁ  cally cited the accusations against Harris.
While I worry the blog will not be allowed 
to stay up long (the UAA often inﬂ  uences and restricts what players may say to the public — which isn’t done to punish players, but to pro-tect them most of the time), I think it is neces-sary for students and fans of Florida to see that many athletes, like Dagostino, don’t agree with 
preferential treatment.
The decision to write the article was proba-
bly one that took a lot of courage. Going against 
the UAA’s rules is a pretty big deal.
But she still wrote it. And what’s even better about the article is 
she’s not just taking this and making it about her opinion. She plans (and I hope she’ll be able to) interview more athletes on their opinions and perspectives of situations like Harris’.
“I know how we (athletes) can be portrayed 
as individuals who have certain things handed 
to us on a silver platter, while that would be nice, 
it is not the case,” Dagostino said on her blog. “... This will not be a one-way blog, but instead one that can be commented on and responded to. Along with that, I want this to be a free zone to talk about athlete’s behavior on and off the ﬁ  elds/courts but outside the classrooms.”
Her hope to make it a two-way forum of dia-
logue on athlete’s behavior is interesting.
She’s not looking to criticize, but to under-
stand, which right now in the midst of all the sexual assault and domestic violence allegations in sports (speciﬁ  cally football), is extremely im-

TOTALED 38 TACKLES.

Multiple Gators in the NFL made 
contact this past weekend. Among 
the 40 former Gators in the NFL, the crew totaled 38 tackles and seven re-ceptions. Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Riley Cooper led the pack with four receptions for 33 yards, including a nine-yard touchdown grab. Cooper’s longest reception of the night was for 14 yards. Sunday’s second quarter touchdown was Coo-per’s ﬁ  rst of the season. Cooper’s catch redeemed a critical drop he made in the end zone during the Eagles’ 26-21 fourth quarter loss to San Francisco on Sept. 28 that would have put the Eagles ahead
“There was no excuses, I dropped 
the ball,” Cooper told CSNPhilly.com. “It was a perfect throw, right on the money, couldn’t have been a better throw from Nick (Foles) and that’s deﬁ  nitely a ball that needs to be caught 10 out of 10 times.”
Cooper admitted catching that 
fourth quarter pass would have changed the outcome of the game. This weekend, Cooper’s perfor-mance changed the outcome of the game for the better for the Eagles.

After yet another weekend 
in which Florida swept its two-
game road trip, the Gators sit 
atop the Southeastern Confer-
ence standings in sole possession of ﬁ  rst place.
No. 6 Florida is now a confer-ence-best 5-0 in SEC play and sits at 10-2 overall this season. It has not lost a game since Sept.12 at 
Stanford.
With wins over No. 9 Texas 
A&M on Friday and Arkansas on 
Sunday, Florida became the only 
team in the SEC with an unde-
feated conference record. Prior to last weekend, neither Texas 
A&M nor Ar-
kansas had a 
conference loss.
Florida has 
six more confer-
ence games to 
play this season, all of which are against teams in the bottom half of the 14-team conference standings.
“There’s a lot of soccer left to 
play,” coach Becky Burleigh said. “For us, I think this team has been really good at kind of ﬁ  ght-
ing human nature and not look-
ing forward.“We’re just really kind of en-
joying the moment and enjoying each game as part of our jour-
ney and we don’t want to rush 
things.”
As a result of Florida’s strong 
weekend performance, two of its 
players earned SEC honors on Jordan, Andujar honored by SEC following two road winsSEE OTERO, PAGE 15SEE NFL, PAGE 15

In another weekend sweep of 
Southeastern Conference foes, Flor-
ida found solace in one player who has not played much this season.
Florida’s (10-3, 4-0 SEC) wins 
over LSU (5-7, 0-3 SEC) on Friday and Mississippi State (5-14, 0-4 SEC) on Sunday left the Gators tied with Kentucky in SEC play as the only two undefeated teams in the confer-ence.
But while Florida still battles for 
No. 1 in the conference, it was busi-
ness as usual for the Gators, whose 
weekend ended more or less in the same fashion as it is previous week-end matches. 
However, instead of freshman 
Rhamat Alhassan or junior Mack-enzie Dagostino being the players to shine, it was outside hitter Gabby Mallette who took the praise.
“Gabby — right now — not only 
is she hitting in the high efficiency level, but she’s making really good hitting choices,” coach Mary Wise 
said. “Her hitting, we call it a hitting 
cone, has really expanded. She is an excellent left-side blocker for us, so to see both parts of this game con-tinuing to get better and better, I re-ally like the physical presence she’s brings to the court.”
Against LSU, Mallette had time 
in all four sets and made 12 kills 
on 21 attempts with only one error, 
completing the match with a .524 
hitting clip. Defensively, the junior 
had one dig and one block assist.
Her play against Mississippi 
State on Sunday was just as just as 
good, if not better.
Mallette finished the match with 
nine kills on 19 attempts with three errors and finished with a .316 hit-ting percentage in just three sets. Again, defensively she provided 
much needed blocking for Florida 
with two total blocks — one block assist and one solo block — and added two digs in the match.
While Mallette made more errors 
in her outing against Mississippi State than against LSU, Wise said Mississippi State was able to effec-tively block Florida’s kill attempts.
“The right-side hitters or the mid-
dle-hitters hitting behind the setter have to really take into account how much space she takes up,” Wise said. “So whether they choose to set away from her or maybe alter the shots, either way she helps us with her presence.”
Mallette has seen less time on the court this season because of Florida’s depth in its roster. 
Last season, Mallette was an in-
tegral cog in the Florida volleyball machine. She finished the season having played in 31 of 32 matches with 2.41 kills per set. 
She was second in solo blocks 
with 16 behind former Florida play-
er Chloe Mann (17).

After winning a title at the 
Southeastern Conference Fall 
Classic in September, much was anticipated of the Gators in the first national championship 
of the season in Tulsa, Okla.
A week later, six of the nine 
Florida men’s tennis players 
flew out west for the 2014 ITA Men’s All-American Champi-onships. 
Beginning in the first round 
of pre-qualifying matches were two upset losses from Josh 
Wardell and Oliver Landert. 
Florida consistently faced de-feat after defeat as Diego Hi-dalgo dropped Round 2 of pre-qualifying matches and Maxx Lipman and Elliott Orkin dropped in round one of the qualifying matches.
Though junior Gordon Wat-
son did not come back with a guaranteed seat for the Nation-al Indoor Collegiate Champi-onships, he cleared his matches best on the team. Ranked No. 70 in the country, Watson dropped his first round of main draw singles to Indiana’s No. 66 Sam Monette (6-2, 6-2). The captain 
of this season’s team brought 
some grit to the court, after los-ing to fellow-Gator Orkin in the SEC Fall Classic.
“I think he was motivated. 
I think when you take a tough loss, even if to a teammate, you try to start finding the answers,” coach Bryan Shelton said. “I 
think Gordon did a little bit of 
soul searching and wanted to figure out what he needed to do better, especially leading into the next tournament. I think 
that mentality helped him start-
ing out the tournament out in Tulsa and getting a couple wins under his belt out early.”
High expectations soon un-
ravelled for Orkin, the cham-pion of the SEC Fall Classic, as he dropped in his first game in round one of qualifying singles 
to Baylor’s Felipe Rios (1-6, 6-2, 
6-0). Ranked No. 66, he pulled a win in consolation singles to Danil Zelenkov from George Washington (7-6 (1), 6-3).
“I think Elliott learned a 
good lesson knowing that he’s always gotta go out there with a chip on his shoulder,” Shelton 
said. “He’s not the tallest guy 
in the world, but he’s got speed and he’s got toughness and he’s got to rely on those two things as well as his ball striking to be successful out there on the court… When he’s got all those things clicking in his favor, he’s dangerous.”
Shelton said the team didn’t 
have great results, but  the tour-nament was good for the team to be humbled early in the sea-son.
“Go out there and take some 
losses, get that chip back on our shoulder where it should be,” Shelton said. 
As the third-year coach 
preps the team for the USTA/ITA Regionals in Athens, Ga., on Oct. 16, he said Florida is focusing on the importance of controlling the second serve. 
“The person that wins the 
most points on second serve is usually the guy that wins the 
match,” Shelton said.Shelton wants men’s 
tennis to play ‘with chip on its shoulder’back Jaylen Watkins was in-
active.
Closer to Gainesville, 
Louis Murphy had three re-
ceptions for 35 yards and a 20-yard touchdown catch on 
Sunday for Tampa Bay. The 
wide receiver’s efforts were 
not enough to secure the win for the Bucs, as they were de-feated by the New Orleans 
Saints in overtime 37-31. 
Former Gators corner-
back Major Wright notched 
four tackles and one pass de-flection while wide receiver 
Solomon Patton returned 
three tackles and one pass 
deflection. 
One of the Swamp’s most 
recent exports — New Eng-
land Patriots defensive end 
Dominique Easley —  made 
his first professional start on 
Sunday. He recorded one 
tackle in New England’s 43-
17 win against the Cincin-
nati Bengals. According to 
the Boston Globe, Easley left 
Sunday’s game with a shoul-
der injury in the first half. 
Not so much contact: 
Four of the 40 former Gators 
currently in the NFL did not 
record any stats this past 
week. The Denver Broncos’ 
Andre Caldwell, Indianapo-lis Colts’  Loucheiz Purifoy, Kansas City Chiefs’ Frankie 
Hammond and St. Louis 
Rams’ Marcus Roberson 
made no significant impact on the field for their respec-tive teams. 
No Gators contributed to 
the Denver Broncos’ 41-21 
win against the Arizona Car-
dinals.
Coming up short: For-
mer Gators linebacker Jon Bostic recorded four tackles 
for the Chicago Bears, but it 
wasn’t enough. The Carolina 
Panthers defeated the Bears 
31-24 on Sunday at Bank of America Stadium in Char-
lotte, N.C.
Viking defensive tackle 
Sharrif Floyd recorded two 
tackles, one sack and two quarterback hits on Thurs-
day. The former Gators ef-
forts were not enough to car-
ry the Vikings to a win. The 
Green Bay Packers went on to defeat the Vikings 42-10. 
Former Gator David Nel-
son notched one tackle and one reception for nine yards for the New York Jets on 
Sunday while fellow Florida 
teammate Jermaine Cun-
ningham remains on injury reserve with a torn Achil-les. Cunningham is expected 
to miss the entire season to 
recover from his injury. The 
Jets could not manage a sin-gle touchdown or field goal against the San Diego Char-
gers, who scored 31 points at 
home. 
Jacksonville defensive 
back Josh Evans recorded 
two tackles but the Jaguars ended up being defeated by the Pittsburgh Steelers 17-9.portant.
I have yet to hear any athlete’s 
opinion on the matter, which is 
fine, but when they do speak out, it’s like a breath of fresh air. For 
once, journalists and just people in 
general aren’t getting a watered-down bullshit answer saying, “I’m just doing it for my team.”
So here’s the deal, Mackenzie 
Dagostino, props to you for doing what no other athlete has done. Speaking out (maybe not by out-right condemning the action), but 
saying that you’re just like other 
students — other average Joes — is something that fans and critics  need to start understanding.
A sexual assault doesn’t ex-
empt you from consequences.
Dagostino asks a good ques-
tion in her post: Why? Why do some athletes feel they are exempt 
from inappropriate behavior?
I’ll leave you with my answer: 
because until recently, football 
and the wins associated with a team have trumped the violation of basic human rights, and until something is done and a statement more than suspending a player for a game is made, it will never change. TUESDAY, OCTOBER 7, 2014 § ALLIGATOR, 15

Savannah Jordan chases the ball during Florida’s 2-1 win against Georgia on Sept. 26 at James G.

Jordan scored goals against Texas A&M, Arkansas this weekend
Monday.
Sophomore forward Savan-
nah Jordan was named SEC 
Offensive Player of the Week 
for the second week in a row and senior defender Tessa An-dujar was named SEC Defen-
sive Player of the Week.
Jordan had two goals last 
weekend, one against Texas 
A&M and one against Arkan-
sas. 
It was the second week in 
a row that Jordan scored two 
goals. Her goal in the 84th minute against Texas A&M 
was the only goal of the game.
Jordan has scored in four 
straight games and leads the 
Gators with nine goals this 
season. It would be safe to say 
that she has found her mid-season groove.
For Andujar, her weekend 
was strong on both the de-fensive and offensive sides of the ball. Andujar’s specialty is quickly playing the ball up the field from the defense and cre-ating scoring opportunities for the offense.
One way to do that is to 
score yourself, which is what Andujar did on Sunday against Arkansas — her first goal of the season. She also registered an assist in each game last week-
end and leads Florida with 
seven this year.
Sunday was Andujar’s first 
game in her Gator career that she recorded both an assist and a goal in the same game. She has started all 12 games this season for Florida and continues to consistently con-
tribute both defensively and 
offensively from her outside back position.
As Florida continues to 
slash its way through SEC competition, Burleigh says the team is in no rush to reach the postseason. They are taking 
the remaining schedule one 
game at a time and not worry-ing about anything else.
“This group really wants to 
sort of savor every moment of the season,” Burleigh said.SOccer , from page 1316, ALLIGATOR � TUESDAY, OCTOBER 7, 2014

UF true freshman quarterback Treon Harris (3) talks with the offensive line during Flor -
ida’s 10-9 win against Tennessee on Saturday at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville, Tenn.
Harris suspended indefinitely
dence in relation to the Harris case.
Huntley Johnson, Harris’ attorney, said 
they are “cooperating with the investigation 
fully,” but would give no further comment.
The case is still being investigated, accord-
ing to the release.
“We have no tolerance for sexual assault 
on our campus,” UF president Bernie Machen 
said in a released statement. “The university is committed to providing a safe and inclusive environment for every member of the UF com-munity. We must strive to protect all of our 
students from sexual harassment and assault, 
and do everything in our power to promote a safe learning environment.”
Dan Apple, an assistant communications 
director at the University Athletic Association, announced via email at 11:10 a.m. Monday that Muschamp’s weekly Monday press confer-ence was cancelled. No explanation was given as to why the press conference was cancelled. 
Muschamp was not available for comment.The press conference is being rescheduled 
for later in the week, according to the email.
Florida is coming off a 10-9, come-from-
behind win against Tennessee on Saturday 
in Knoxville, Tenn. The Gators scored all 10 of their points against the Volunteers in the fourth quarter on back-to-back drives led by Harris, who replaced starter Jeff Driskel with 
eight seconds remaining in the third quarter.
On the season, Harris has completed four 
of his six pass attempts for 165 yards and two 
touchdowns. Both touchdown passes came 
against Eastern Michigan on his first two ca-
reer attempts, going for 70 and 78 yards, re-spectively. 
With Harris suspended, Driskel will likely 
be Florida’s starter against LSU on Saturday at 
Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. True freshman Will 
Grier or redshirt sophomore Skyler Mornhin-weg will serve as Driskel’s backup against the Tigers.

Freshman Taylor Tomlinson 
and sophomore Kelly Grassel 
might have taken different paths to becoming athletes on the Flor-
ida women’s golf team, but after 
the team struggled to a 12th place 
finish at the Cougar Classic, both of them are standing out for coach Emily Glaser.
“We’re coming off a mediocre 
finish at the Cougar Classic, didn’t play great up there, but we left still with some positive vibes,” Glaser said. “We learned a lot from the tournament, especially with the new girls, who we hadn’t seen compete up close yet and so we got some good feedback from them.”
Tomlinson decided to stay 
close to home when it came time to pick a college to play golf. The Gainesville native completed her first tournament at 11-over-par, 
but she saved her best for the final 
round of play when she shot an 
even-par, 72. The freshman comes into UF with high expectations, af-ter a high school career in which 
she was ranked as the No. 2 player 
in the state of Florida and No. 10 in Golfweek’s girl’s junior ranking 
for the class of 2014.
For Grassel, her path to UF was 
a little bit different. Originally play-ing at Michigan State her freshman year, Grassel decided to transfer to 
play under coach Glaser, who coin-cidentally played for the Spartans 
herself. Grassel was successful in her only season in East Lansing, as she had the lowest scoring average by a freshman in the school’s his-
tory with an average of 75.40.
But Grassel is now at UF and at 
the Cougar Classic as she finished 
as the best player on the team with a score of 5-over-par. Gras-
sel’s best day came in the opening 
round when she shot an even-par, 
72. Over the next two rounds, she was able to stay consistent and her overall score was good enough for 
a tie for 38th place.
Tomlinson and Grassel will be counted on this year as the fall sea-
son continues. Even though they performed well in their opening tournament for the Gators, Glaser said both Grassel and Tomlinson 
had problems trying to do too 
much on the golf course.   
“It’s hard not to go in with some 
high expectations, and it’s easy to 
get a little ahead of yourself, and I 
think both of them probably strug-
gled with that a little bit,” Glaser 
said. “But they did a good job throughout the week of managing that a little bit better every day and 
I think getting one under their belt 
is a big key for them in the fall.”  
Tomlinson, Grassel playing big roles for UF early in season

still with some positive
