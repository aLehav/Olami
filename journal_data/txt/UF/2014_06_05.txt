UF is reaping the beneﬁ  ts of Florida’s 
largest budget in history, which pays for 
new study spaces, renovations and the university’s preeminence campaign.
Gov. Rick Scott signed Florida’s 2014-
2015 budget on Monday, allocating almost $100 million to UF.“There were a few pretty tiny vetoes, 
but for the most part we received a lot of what we had requested,” said UF spokes-woman Janine Sikes.
This includes $10 million to renovate 
Newell Hall into a study space for stu-dents, a longtime project for UF Student Government.
“After a long haul of advocating for 
funding for direly needed study space on campus, Scott and the Florida Legislature have ﬁ  nally signed off on this project,” said Student Body President Cory Yeffet during Tuesday night’s Student Senate.      
“It’s truly amazing to see what effect 
we can have on the state level,” he said. 
The project, which would turn New-
ell Hall into a bookless, 24/7 study hall, would cost about $13 million, according to Alligator archives.
“There are talks about pairing that UF strikes it big from Florida’s budget

Hurricane season began this 
week, and experts say college stu-
dents should be prepared.
After nine years without any ma-
jor hurricanes in Florida, Gainesville residents have grown complacent — but they shouldn’t be, according to emergency management ofﬁ  cials. 
“No one has a crystal ball to say 
whether we’re going to be impacted by tropical weather or not,” said UF emergency manager Kenneth Allen. 
Although no storms are currently 
being tracked in Alachua County, Al-len said everyone in Florida should prepare for storms through the end of hurricane season in November.

ucation and behavior junior Crystal Pinder knows ﬁ  rsthand how intense Florida’s storm season can get.

Grace Marketplace, Gainesville’s homeless services 
center, ofﬁ  cially opened Sunday with goals of providing a 
space for homeless people to come together, eat and even-tually have a place to stay overnight. 
The facility, located at 2845 NE 39th Ave., is open daily from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Meals, mail pickup and referral ser-vices are provided, and partner agencies are providing a variety of social services as well. 
Jon DeCarmine, director of operations for the North 
Central Florida Coalition for the Homeless and Hungry, said the purpose of bringing organizations, like Veterans Affairs, to one place is to make life easier for homeless people or people at risk.“The idea with this place is that I can say, ‘We have 
identiﬁ  ed what service you need. It’s in this building right over here,’ so that there’s no transportation barrier,” De-Carmine said.
The center’s services will eventually include overnight 
shelter. DeCarmine said about 25 beds will be available New city-county homeless center to be one-stop hub for help“No one has a crystal ball to

money with private funding,” Yeffet 
said, but no plans are set in stone.
Another key project is the renova-
tion of the chemistry building. This year, $20 million was allocated to the project, on top of the $22 million the Legislation has approved in the past. 
“This completes the total building 
cost,” Sikes said.
Other wins for the university in-
clude an extra $5 million per year in preeminence funding. As the state’s designated preeminence university, UF already receives $15 million annu-ally.
“Increased funding for our plan to 
become one of the nation’s top 10 pub-lic research universities will support the pursuit of scientiﬁ  c breakthroughs and the economic development that comes with innovation,” UF President Bernie Machen said in a statement.
Machen also noted that the $16 to 
$18 million going to UF’s Health Can-cer Center “will reinforce our efforts to save lives in a state with 117,000 newly diagnosed cases each year.”
With this funding, UF’s cancer 
center will be able to pursue National Cancer Institute designation, a mea-sure encouraged by Scott. 
“We are extremely grateful to the 
Legislature and Scott for the level of funding allocated to the University of Florida for the upcoming ﬁ  scal year,” Machen said. 
“We are pleased that this budget 
gives us the resources to do more for our students and the state of Florida.”4, ALLIGATOR � THURSDAY, JUNE 5, 2014

Myrtle Belﬂ  ower, 27, pick up books from  Grace Marketplace’s library on Wednesday. 
The homeless center opened Sunday and offers free meals twice a day. Several facili-ties are open to visitors.
Computer lab to be added soon   
starting July 1.
Theresa Lowe, executive director of the 
Alachua County Coalition for the Home-
less and Hungry, said that tent camping will also be an option at Grace Market-place in the future.
Laundry facilities, a computer lab, a 
Dress for Success clothing closet and se-cure storage spaces are scheduled to be added within a few months.   
While the city and county are provid-
ing $308,000 annually for the operation of Grace Marketplace, Lowe said an ad-ditional $20,000 per month is needed to maintain its current level of service.
“To expand our services to where we feel they should be, we need another mil-lion dollars a year,” Lowe said.
Volunteers are also needed for a variety 
of tasks at the center, including reception, serving meals, sorting donations, ﬁ  xing up the grounds and eventually overnight supervision,  Lowe said.
“If there’s something somebody is 
willing and able to do, if they are willing to take the time to come out here to do it, it’s something we could probably use,” DeCarmine said.
Jonathon Nunes, a 22-year-old UF in-
ternational relations junior, said he plans to volunteer at Grace Marketplace. The the issue of homelessness has personal signiﬁ  cance for him. 
“My father has been intermittently 
homeless for 10 years,” Nunes said. “Once you’re homeless, it’s very hard not to be homeless. I feel that the center’s mis-sion is something that’s doable and good, and something that I can be a part of. Our community suffers from a severe problem, but I think with the right level of attention and dedication, it can be rectiﬁ  ed.” GRACE , from page 1

“Our power was off for a whole week,” 
she said. 
At the time, Pinder was scared. School 
was closed, and the wind howled. She and 
her family found ways to entertain them-selves as they waited out the storm. 
“It was a tough experience, but we got 
through it,” she said. 
Pinder said she’s not worried about this 
summer’s storms, however. She lives far from the beach on the fourth ﬂ  oor of an apartment in Gainesville, she said. 
Regardless of their altitude, students 
like Pinder should still be prepared, Allen said.
Floridians should load up on important 
safety items such as ﬂ  ashlights, coolers and portable generators, all of which are tax-exempt throughout the state until June 8. 
College students speciﬁ  cally are encour-aged to gather a three- to four-day disas-ter supply kit complete with water, food, batteries, back up phone chargers, ﬁ  rst-aid items, current identiﬁ  cation and important documents such as medical or health insur-ance information. 
And don’t forget Fido, either. Cats and dogs should be wearing collars 
with up-to-date information and should have enough food to last out the storm as well, according to Gainesville Regional Utilities’ safety checklist. 
“We encourage students to get a plan, 
get a kit and be informed,” Allen said.
In the event of an emergency, students 
should call Alachua County Emergency Management at 352-264-6500 for evacua-tion information.
Alachua County emergency manage-
ment coordinator Jen Horner said college students can take advantage of having two homes. 
If a storm does head toward campus this 
summer, Horner recommends waiting it out with relatives. 
“I think the number one thing is to go 
back home,” she said. “Go home to mom and dad.”HURRICANE , from page 1

Alan Shapiro began his horticultural career 
cutting grass, and soon, he may be growing it.
Located down a bumpy, native plant-lined 
dirt road is Grandiflora, a 106-acre wholesale 
regional plant nursery with clients including Disney, UF and Busch Gardens.
Shapiro, the 63-year-old president of Gran-
diflora, gestures at the rows of the nearly 2,000 types of neatly potted succulents, flowers and herbs in his greenhouses.
“Look, we do medicinal plants already,” he 
said, pointing at a patch of aloe, a plant used to treat sunburns.
Each of the flowering plants bears the 
phrase “Grandiflora Grown...long-lasting southern blooms.”
But someday soon, that label may find 
its way onto an entirely different product — medical marijuana.
Grandiflora, also known as San Felasco 
Nurseries Inc., is one of 39 nurseries that meet the specifications of Florida’s latest medical marijuana legislation.
Senate Bill 1030, also known as the “Com-
passionate Medical Cannabis Act of 2014,” would legalize non-euphoric medical marijua-na for specified patients with debilitating or terminal diseases. The legislation has passed in both the House and the Senate, and Gov. Rick Scott has signaled that he will not veto it.
According to the bill, nurseries seeking 
a license must meet specific qualifications. They must have been in business for at least 30 years, have the capacity to grow more than 400,000 plants and afford a $5 million bond.
But only five nurseries in Florida will be li-censed to grow the crop — one for each corner of the state, plus central Florida.
The rest of the details — on growing, dis-
pensing and selling the product — are pretty much up in the air, said Aaron Keller, spokes-man for the Florida Department of Agricul-ture.
“The Florida Department of Health will be 
doing rulemaking, and they will really be the point agency involved in creating that system of regulation and enforcement,” he said. “Our role as the Department of Agriculture is really just to identify the growers who would be al-lowed to based on the Legislature’s actions.”
The Northeast section of the state, where 
Gainesville falls, has two potential candidates: Grandiflora, in Gainesville, and Loop’s Nurs-ery, in Jacksonville.
When the original list of potential growers 
came out, Shapiro said he was surprised to see his nursery named but even more so at the flood of phone calls that followed.
“People are calling me from other states 
where it’s already been legalized for medical marijuana, and they would like to partner, or they would like to support growers, they would like to help set up our operation,” he said. “Our phone’s been ringing off the hook since our name started going on the list.”
But before he can even begin to consider 
taking on partners, Shapiro said he’s going to find a lawyer to help him with the process.
He doesn’t know what kind of changes 
he’d have to make to be able to grow the herb, as the state has yet to release details, but he’d be willing to retrofit empty or unused parts of the nursery to meet requirements.
“I’m not counting my chickens before they 
hatch,” he said. “Because I don’t want to put tons of research in and then fail. I want to do just enough to do the proposal for the state and explain to them why we’d be a good operation for them to use.”
Shapiro has been involved with horticul-
ture since he mowed lawns during his sum-mers at UF, where he graduated in 1972 with an English degree.
Now, more than 40 years later, he still 
loves plants and their benefits to humanity. Although his motivations are monetary, Sha-piro said he still worries about the effects of legalized marijuana on society, especially its exposure to children.
“Even if you have stores that check your ID, 
you can always convince an older friend to get it for you or raid your mom’s liquor cabinet,” he said. “What’s to say the same thing won’t happen with marijuana?”THURSDAY, JUNE 5, 2014 � ALLIGATOR, 5

Gainesville Police arrested a 
man after he allegedly placed an 
AK-47 assault rifle to the forehead of a motorcyclist.
Police arrested 48-year-old 
Gainesville resident Peter Bakke on charges of aggravated battery, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and resisting an officer early Tuesday morning, according to a police report.
Bakke was upset with a motor-
cyclist who he believed was driv-ing too loudly through Brandy-wine Condominiums.  
Bakke got inside of his four-
door Dodge Durango and began looking for the motorcyclist. 
When Bakke caught up, he hit 
the motorcyclist with his car, caus-ing him to fall, according to the report. 
Bakke got out of his car carry-
ing a gun, described as an AK-47 in the report. He took the gun and placed the barrel against the mo-torcyclist’s forehead.
“I’ve been looking for you for 
30 minutes,” Bakke said, according to the report. “Tomorrow we can be best friends, but tonight I want to kill you.”
Bakke then placed the AK-47 on 
the passenger seat of his car and pulled out another gun, which he also allegedly placed to the motor-cyclist’s forehead. 
Bakke began talking to himself, according to the report. When Bakke turned his back, the mo-torcyclist got up and ran to his motorcycle to drive home and 
call the police. 
When offi-
cers arrived at Bakke’s apartment, he refused to listen to their com-mands to come out, according to the report. But when he did, officers put 
him in handcuffs and searched his apartment with his permission.   
Officers found two duffel bags 
containing various weaponry, ac-cording to the report. 
One of the bags contained mul-
tiple guns, including an AK-47. The other bag contained ammunition rounds, magazines and knives. 
Officers booked Bakke into the 
Alachua County Jail at about 4:40 a.m. As of press time, his bond is set at $60,000.

An easy way to earn scholarship 
money is literally at the click of a button.
Urge, an app that allows college 
students to connect with others at their 
school, is hosting a competition for stu-dents at 50 schools in the U.S.    
All students need to do to enter is go 
to scholarsmackdown.com, submit their school emails and start clicking their mouses to collect tallies for their chosen school. The top 10 clickers will be en-tered into a tweet-off to win one of the two $5,000 scholarships. 
Kyle Banuelos, one of the founders of Urge, said the app, which will officially launch in the fall, is a way for people to make friends at large universities. They can be introduced to people online and hang out on campus. 
“A lot of applications (like Facebook) 
are trying to connect students online,” he said, “but Urge is about connecting to people offline and in the moment.”
Becca Heller, a 20-year-old UF micro-
biology junior, said although having an app that allows people to meet offline is nice for some people, she’d rather meet her friends in person.
“You don’t always know who you 
are talking to online,” she said.
People can act differently online than 
they actually are in person, Heller said. It’s easier to fabricate a personality on-line.College networking app

UF was ranked ninth nationally for most 
influential colleges in social media by College 
Atlas, the encyclopedia for higher education.
According to College Atlas’ website, UF 
ranks above Ivy League universities such as Princeton University, Brown University and Cornell University. No other Florida schools were in the top 30. 
Andrew Selepak, director of the online mas-
ter’s program with specialization in social me-dia in UF’s College of Journalism and Commu-nications, said he thinks social media is cyclical. First, the university shares information. Then, students share it with friends and parents.
The recent news of more night football 
games, for instance, was exciting to college stu-dents and easy to share, he said.
“How else would that have been shared 15, 
20 years ago?” he said. “I could email some-body and say ‘Hey, guess what?’ but instead I just repost it, or I share it or tweet it, and every-body I know now has the same information.”
UF was assigned letter grades for five social 
media platforms. The university received A’s for Twitter, Google Plus and Instagram. UF’s Facebook page received a B ranking, and the LinkedIn account, with almost 186,000 con-nected alumni, received an A-.
Alina Avalos, a 19-year-old UF public rela-
tions junior, has noticed a shift toward more interaction with students by UF’s social media team.
“Well, what I thought was cool was when 
the incoming freshmen class for this year was announced … They would personally congrat-ulate some of the people,” Avalos said.

Florida’s not nicknamed the Gunshine State for nothing, 
and this week, Stephen Colbert spotlighted Big Pine Key man Doug Varrieur in “The Colbert Report”’s “Difference Mak-ers,” which celebrates “regular Americans who are out there making the world a better-ish place.” Varrieur is despised by his neighbors because he uses his backyard, which is com-pletely open and looks over the canal in Big Pine with the highest boat and kayak trafﬁ  c, as a shooting range. But it’s totally safe, he assured Colbert — his two elderly parents are his lookouts, and he parks his two trucks (which are full of fuel) next to the range as a shield in case he misses.
“Nation, I love every state in America equally,” he said. “I 
could never pick a favorite. But, gun to my head, I’d choose Florida — the state where I’d most likely have a gun to my head.”
So this week, we’re giving Colbert a thanks-for-the-shout-
out LAUREL.
Oh boy. This week, Gov. Rick Scott signed the largest state 
budget ever on Monday, dubbing it the “It’s Your Money Tax Cut Budget.” Unlike past years, the Tampa Bay Times wrote in an editorial, there was no fanfare — he didn’t host a bud-get-signing ceremony.
“The silence leaves it for anyone to guess why Scott, who 
says he wants to increase Florida’s STEM economy, vetoed $750,000 for a proven program to teach algebra to middle school students started by SRI International in Pinellas Coun-ty,” the editorial board wrote.
Which isn’t to say the budget is bad: He authorized a ton 
of funding for education, child protection and welfare, cancer research and Everglades restoration. But Florida still spends less per pupil than former Gov. Charlie Crist’s administra-tion. We’re tossing a we-know-you’re-pandering-to-voters-
and-being-generally-shady DART at Scott’s budget.
But hey, not all news that comes out of Florida is gun-, 
drug- or Rick Scott-related. Sometimes it’s about terrifying great white sharks.

foot shark, since 2013 when they tagged her with a satellite tracking device in order to better understand shark migra-tion patterns. So far, they’ve found that her route comes eerily close to heavily populated areas, and she apparently likes to surface often.
“Remember, they’ve always been doing that. We just 
know it for the ﬁ  rst time,” Chris Fischer, founder of a non-proﬁ  t group that researches sharks, said.
Well, we can’t argue with that. We’re awarding an in-
the-name-of-scientiﬁ  c-discovering LAUREL to Katharine 
the great white shark for being such an agreeable subject. Now if only she can help us ﬁ  gure out why Universal Studios thought three sequels to “Jaws” was a good idea.

Following the release of American prisoner of war Sgt. 
Bowe Bergdahl last week, questions and allegations started to ﬂ  y over why the Obama administration ne-
gotiated with the Taliban for Bergdahl’s release. Some claim that Bergdahl was a deserter, thus negating any reason to trade suspected terrorists for Bergdahl. Others — includ-ing House Speaker John Boehner — have already called for congressional hearings to investigate the matter. 
So much for leaving no man behind. Obama has reached a point in his presidency where he 
can do no right. During the George W. Bush administration, Bush reached a similar situation, but that was following the destruction of Hurricane Katrina, the war in Iraq and the near collapse of the U.S. economy. Obama’s problem is he merely exists, and so long as he occupies the White House, any action his administration takes will be seen as direct conﬂ  ict with America, freedom and democracy. 
Critiques of Obama aside, we probably deserve some 
clarity about what happened to Bergdahl before his cap-ture by the Taliban — and let’s hope the military conducts whatever investigation they deem appropriate — but it’s past time for us to stop politicizing every action taken by the president and his White House. 
Yes, Obama holds a political position, but just because 
the man takes an action does not mean the opposition must be diametrically opposed to that action. Where are the military veterans serving in Congress — especially former POW John McCain — on this issue? 
McCain called the prisoner swap a “mistake,” seeming 
to ignore his own predicament when he was held captive by the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War. Could McCa-in not step out of line with the Republicans to simply say we’re glad to have one of our soldiers home?
Never.Bergdahl’s release was secured by a Democratic presi-
dential administration and therefore was obviously the wrong course of action. 
The U.S. spent trillions of dollars, and thousands of 
brave men and women gave their lives for two wars that stretched for more than a decade, and we’ve accomplished very little as a result. Iraq is a mess, and the Taliban could very well regain control of Afghanistan once we leave, but by all means, let’s argue over the release of an American soldier held captive by the enemy. 
If Bergdahl went AWOL ﬁ  ve 
years ago as some suspect, then the military — not the politicians 
— should handle the situation. Instead, what we have here is just another boogeyman for Republicans to chase, and chase it they will. 
Obama’s had a challenging presidency, and Republicans 
will stop at nothing to discredit and delegitimize a demo-cratically elected president before his term ends in January 2017. The future of the GOP may very well rely on wound-ing Obama and the Democrats prior to the 2016 election or Republicans could lose their third presidential election in a row. 
The situation surrounding Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is just 
one more link in the chain of destruction built by the GOP. When you can’t win national elections, you aren’t left with many options, and it’s led Republicans into search-and-destroy mode. With each news story, the Republicans pivot to the next big scandal. When the Obamacare website was a mess, it was the key issue that would end Democratic rule, but when the website started working, Republicans pivoted to the attacks in Benghazi, Libya and the scandal at the IRS. When the horrendous waits for veterans at VA facilities across the country hit the headlines, Republicans were there to demand heads, and now, they have Bergdahl in their sights. 
A man was held captive by the enemy for ﬁ  ve years, and 
instead of welcoming him home, politicians are lining up to call him a coward and a deserter. 
The question for everyone is: Would the same politicians 
do this if a Republican occupied the White House?

Gia Coppola’s directorial 
debut, “Palo Alto,” opening 
tomorrow at the Hippodrome State Theatre, is in some ways a mix of “Mean Girls” and “The Catcher in the Rye.” It’s a coming-of-age film that frankly addresses the sex, drugs, de-spondency and debauchery of adolescence, while at the same time mourning the loss of its characters’ childhoods.
But unlike those two stand-
by specimens of the “young adult” genre, Coppola’s film ultimately seems to call bulls**t on the mythology of “growing up.” Regardless of age, no one in the film seems to grow up very much at all.
Emma Roberts plays April, 
the pretty-but-plain girl who dresses like a doll and wears cotton underwear coded with the days of the week. She catch-es the eye of her soccer coach Mr. B., played by a creepy James Franco (who wrote the film’s namesake short-story collection), and of her timid classmate, Teddy (Jack Kilmer). Things have apparently fizzled out between Teddy and April before the film begins, but an awkward encounter at a party suggests there’s something still there — at least that’s what we hope.
Opposite Teddy and April 
are Emily (Zoe Levin) and Fred (Nat Wolff): one, the soft-spo-ken girl who’s at her loneliest after she gets laid, the other, a loud, leader-of-the-pack kind of troublemaker whose bite might actually be worse than his bark. Looking for different things, the two collide in ways that call into question the cost of controlling your own loneli-ness.
That’s basically the “plot” 
of the film: Lonely people col-lide with other lonely people, making for 100 minutes that are frequently boring. Teens hook up with adults, adults prey on emotionally sensitive teens, and disgruntled delin-quents draw dicks in the pages of children’s books. In every case, someone is searching for the youth they lost or destroy-ing the youth that others have. Adults and adolescents become interchangeable, and the limits of “youth” recede.
Despite its association with 
Brat Pack films (sonically evoked by Blood Orange’s Devonté Hynes shiny, synth-heavy score), this is not the tale of misfits coming together. Coppola keeps us from indulg-ing in any cliche climaxes that might suggest otherwise. A tender reunion between Teddy and April, for example, deflates when Teddy confesses he cut down the tree they carved a heart on. It doesn’t really phase April, anyway.
Transactions like this are 
sure to resonate with irony-ob-sessed millennials conditioned by a social media world where things are never quite what they seem. But, they don’t al-ways work effectively. When April has sex for the first time, the shot of her little girl under-wear —labeled “Thursday”—seems hackneyed and over-wrought. The effect would have been stronger if Coppola hadn’t staged Emily and Fred’s sex scene in a room full of dolls and doilies — similar signifiers of resilient childhood.
That said, Coppola’s only 
stumble in this film is that she tries too hard to be self-con-scious and postmodern. She certainly accomplishes both, but excessively so — an accusa-tion you could levy against any young artist, and one that she’ll surely outgrow.
The film runs through June 
12. Student tickets are $5.50 for all showings.

Disney’s “Maleficent” is so 
many things at once. It is a beau-
tiful fairy tale. It is visually stun-ning. It is overdone. It is messy.
And it contains one of the best 
performances so far this year by one of the most recognizable fig-ures in Hollywood.
If I sound conflicted, it is be-
cause “Maleficent” is a conflicted film. Disney’s latest movie at-tempts to retell the classic “Sleep-ing Beauty” story through the eyes of the villainess Maleficent — and  for the most part, the story is for-gettable. 
Overproduced CGI battles, a bombastic score and a lack of con-sistent directorial vision through-out the movie make “Maleficent” much less than what it could have been.
There is such a contrast between 
the first 30 minutes and the rest of the film that I’m convinced direc-tor Robert Stromberg had a stroke midway through production.
What a waste, too, because the 
first half-hour convinced me that Disney had achieved the unique: a summer blockbuster that feels like an original and artful piece of film-making. Instead we get a mess of different ideas and tones that con-trast and fight with one another.
Contained within all of this 
mess, however, is a performance of almost elemental power and beauty. Angelina Jolie is absolute-ly dazzling as the titular villain-ess. Sporting cheekbones that you could cut yourself on, stunning emerald eyes and ruby lips, Jolie exudes an aura of mystical and dangerous femininity.
This might 
have been a dis-traction from an inferior actress — Jolie is exalted by it. She wears her horns like a crown. I cannot 
recall a more spellbinding perfor-mance in a Hollywood fantasy. 
The way she uses her silences 
mesmerize and make the audience lean forward in their seats, catch-ing her every word and movement. She is so good that the movie’s few scenes without her feel empty and pointless.
Her real power moment, how-
ever, comes not from casting a spell but from genuine hurt and anger in the most disturbing scene I’ve ever seen in a Disney movie, maybe in Hollywood fairy tales overall.
Feminism is a strong theme in 
this movie, continuing “Frozen”’s message that love and trust be-tween two women is just as impor-tant as love from a man. 
The character who Maleficent 
can most closely be compared to is the ice queen, Elsa, who was simi-larly betrayed and isolated. Elsa also doesn’t end up with a man and finds similar plot momentum and satisfaction in the love of an-other woman.
This movie advances the femi-
nist message even more: dispelling that popular Hollywood trope of the old, bitter harpy feeling jeal-ousy and rage toward the younger and more beautiful woman. Disney deserves applause for attempting to bring feminism to the younger generation in “Brave,” “Frozen” and now, “Maleficent.”
For all of Maleficent’s flaws — 
and there are quite a few — it was a also a singularly powerful and sometimes artful piece of entertain-ment. Jolie is so good in this role she makes the movie’s problems seem like minor missteps instead of deal breakers, and the ending will leave audiences very satisfied. 
I give it three-and-a-half stars 
out of five stars.

Hundred Waters, a band formed 
in 2011 with roots in Gainesville, 
has covered genres from electronic to indie to folk to hip-hop with their tempos and drums over their last couple projects. Though their self-titled album, released in 2012, introduced the ability to cover those genres, the band’s most re-cent effort, “The Moon Rang Like A Bell,” enhanced and honed in on those sounds.
The album’s narrative lead 
singer Nicole Miglis on a 12-track quest for peace and trust in some-one or something, only to bear her loneliness and incompleteness on the album’s final track, “No Sound.” But where the lyrics are sometimes drowned out or hard to understand because they act as an instrument, the band excels in its enhanced production to help visu-alize Miglis’ narrative.
The backing members of Hun-dred Waters surround Miglis’ high-pitched, spacious voice with a combination of electro-pop synths (“Xtalk”), dusty pianos (“Mur-murs”) and heavy bass and drums (“Innocent”), even using Miglis’ voice as an instrument (“Mur-murs”), to enhance the songs’ themes of untrustworthiness, lone-liness and love. 
For example, the wooden, jun-
gle-esque xylophones in “[Ani-mal]” and the galloping drums in “Seven White Horses” both add deeper layers to the overall sound, which is much more than guitar and piano chords with matching bass notes and drums. Every note, every distortion of the voice, every bass hit means something to the narrative.
The band has grown in every 
aspect of its music since its first project released two years ago from the production to the over-arching sound, and “The Moon Rang Like A Bell” is the band’s best work yet.

Some of Gainesville’s top bars and clubs 
are sweating this summer, and it’s not just 
because of the heat. 
Business at these local watering holes is 
lagging thanks to a shrunken student popu-lation with no financial aid dollars to spend.
“The amount of people who go out has 
drastically declined,” said Shimal Patel, own-er of Sharab Lounge, located at 109 S. Main St.
Patel had to close Sharab’s doors for the 
last three weeks in order to rethink his busi-ness strategy.
Up until now, Patel has been able to stay 
alive during the summer by closing down one of the club’s two floors when the lounge isn’t busy. He leaves the hookah bar on the first floor open but closes the second-floor lounge where a live disc jockey plays.
To encourage more students to visit Shar-
ab, Patel plans to change the way drinks are served and music is chosen.
“We also plan on going back to the way 
we were five years ago,” he said. He plans on doing this by pouring the drinks students request and not just a specific menu that they can choose from.
Patel also plans to have promoter DJs 
come in and play the music students want to hear on the days they want to hear it.
“I have a resident DJ on Thursday, Friday 
and Saturday during the Fall and Spring se-mesters,” he said. “When it is slow, I hire a promoter to pick DJs based on students’ likes and dislikes in music.”One thing Patel says he will not do, how-
ever, is raise the price of cover, drinks or hoo-kah at Sharab. He plans to keep the prices student friendly.  
That’s important to students like Chan-
telle Morgan, a 20-year-old UF public rela-tions junior. 
“I haven’t been going out that much be-
cause I have been too busy studying,” she said. “It doesn’t help that I don’t get any fi-nancial aid during the Summer.”
Students are unable to go out as frequently 
as they do in Fall and Spring semesters due to the lack of financial aid that is dispersed and the heavy course load that comes with six-to-10-week classes in the Summer semester.
But diminished crowds of students may 
be a boon to up-and-coming DJs. 
Don Bell, a DJ for Mainstream DJs, said 
that if a new DJ wants to try out the profes-sion, his or her best bet is to speak with local establishments during the summer. With less competition than in the fall or spring, sum-mer offers a better shot at local success for an aspiring or up-and-coming DJ.
Melvin Shackelford, who is part of the 
Simons management team, said that in the summer, the club is able to try out new DJs and see how the students react to them. He said DJs from Gainesville and from as far away as Orlando contact him with requests to perform at Simons.
Whether they start off in the summer, Bell 
said the lifespan for DJs depend on how well they know their environment.
Slow summer nights, scarce students sting some local clubs
But turn the tables for new DJs
“I haven’t been going out that 
much because I have been too busy 
studying. It doesn’t help that I don’t 
get any financial aid during the 
Summer.”

Food is more than just nutri-
ents. Food conjures up memories 
and reveals who we are and who we are not. What we eat is a me-dium for personal recollection and collective identity. Marcel Proust, the great French author, is famous for connecting food and memory with madeleines, “those squat plump little cakes.” We certainly have him to thank for those little packages of “petite French cakes” at every Starbucks checkout.
Let’s turn to the renowned 
passage where the ﬂ  eeting cookie inspires  a recollection of the nar-rator’s childhood in the village of Combray, France, in Proust’s “Remembrance of Things Past.” Dipping the scalloped but-ter cake-cookie in tea, Proust is stirred with vivid memories:
“She (Marcel’s mother) sent 
for one of those squat plump little cakes called ‘petites madeleines,’ which look as though they had been molded in the ﬂ  uted valve of a scallop shell … I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea in which I had soaked a morsel of the cake. No sooner had the warm liquid mixed with the crumbs touched my palate than a shudder ran through me and I stopped, intent upon the extraordinary thing that was happening to me. An exqui-site pleasure invaded my senses.
And suddenly the memory re-
vealed itself. The taste was that of the little piece of madeleine which on Sunday mornings at Combray … when I went to say good morning to her in her bed-room, my aunt Leonie used to give me, dipping it ﬁ  rst in her own cup of tea or tisane …. and the whole of Combray and its surroundings, taking shape and solidity, sprang into being, town and garden alike, from my cup of tea.”
The encounter with the mad-
eleine was magical for Proust and sparked his writing of seven volumes of ﬁ  ctionalized recollec-tions. While we are not asking you to write that much, try writ-ing a short vignette based on your personal madeleine. Some stories may conjure up sweet, sour or bittersweet memories. 
To start, reﬂ  ect on a food that 
is ﬁ  lled with emotional, autobio-graphical and symbolic mean-ing to you, such as Proust’s tiny cake. It may be a holiday meal or an after-school packaged snack. Try to taste it before writing. Describe it and the images and 
memories it conjures up. Is it homemade or commercial? Is it positive, negative or in between (bittersweet)? Is it a demographic marker of gender, race, religion, generation or class? Does eating it make you feel part of a group, or excluded?
Food memories are often nos-
talgic and related to growing up. A taste of crunchy wafﬂ  es or grandmother’s apple pie may conjure up thoughts of Dad’s weekend brunch or special Sun-day dinners shared after church or in the fall. A recollection of tamales, café con leche or Phila-delphia cheesecake invokes eth-nic or regional markers, and the memories may serve to preserve identities affected by migration and mobility. Particular foods spark powerful personal recol-lections and associations, reveal-ing a key concept of food studies: We are what we ate. And to add the linguistic component, words help to recollect and convey these memories.
For additional reading of the 
creative use of food memories, try Molly Wizenberg’s “A Home-made Life,” Ruth Reichl’s “Tender at the Bone,” Sharon Boorstin’s “Let Us Eat Cake: Adventures in Food and Friendship,” and Mark Winegardner’s “We Are What We Ate: 24 Memories of Food.”

ﬂ  our (do not use unbleached ﬂ  our)
•3/4 cup unsalted butter, 
melted and cooled
•1 tablespoon unsalted 
butter, for buttering madeleine tins
Place the eggs and sugar in 
a large bowl. Then, use a whisk or an electric mixer and beat until lemon colored. Add the zest. Fold in the ﬂ  our, then 3/4 cup melted butter.Refrigerate the batter, cov-
ered, for one hour.
Preheat the oven to 375 de-
grees Fahrenheit.
Butter the madeleine tins. 
Then spoon in the batter, ﬁ  lling each well about three-fourths full. Bake 10 to 12 minutes, or until the madeleines are gold-en brown.
Remove the madeleines 
from their tins as soon as they’re baked, and cool them on a wire rack. (Note: Wash the tins immediately with a stiff brush and hot water but no de-tergent so that they retain their seasoning.) 
The madeleines are best 
eaten as soon as they’ve cooled. They may, however, be stored for several days in an airtight container.

year coach said. “Are we talented 
enough to win the Women’s College World Series? I think yes. Are we ca-pable of that? I think yes.”
Forty-nine days later, Walton’s 
thoughts were conﬁ  rmed, as No. 5 seed Florida (55-12) defeated sec-ond-seeded Alabama (53-13) 6-3 on Tuesday to sweep the Crimson Tide and win the ﬁ  rst national champion-ship in Gators softball history.
“This is kind of a surreal moment 
for me right now sitting up here with Hannah and the other kids that bought into it this year,” Walton said.
After senior Hannah Rogers 
started and ﬁ  nished Florida’s ﬁ  rst four games in the Women’s College World Series — giving up just three runs in 26 innings of work — Wal-ton decided to roll the dice and give Lauren Haeger the start in the circle on Tuesday.
“It’s a three-game series, and 
that’s how we’ve been doing it all year,” Haeger said. “Hannah has been doing great, and I told my team and told Hannah, I’m going to go as long and as hard as I can, and I knew I had two pitchers behind me that were going to shut everyone down, too.”
Haeger struggled in the ﬁ  rst in-ning, giving up back-to-back singles to start the contest and surrender-ing a one-out RBI single to Alabama right ﬁ  elder Jadyn Spencer to give the Crimson Tide an early 1-0 lead.
Florida responded in the bottom 
half of the frame, with senior Steph-anie Tofft launching a Jaclyn Traina pitch over the left-ﬁ  eld fence for a two-out home run to even the score.
The Gators tacked on four more 
runs in the bottom half of the frame, three of which came from a Kirsti Merritt blast to left ﬁ  eld — her second long ball of the Women’s College World Series — to extend Florida’s lead to 5-1 and force Traina out of the circle after just 1.1 innings of work. UF plated its ﬁ  nal run in the sixth inning when Tofft scored Stewart on a ﬁ  elder’s choice.Haeger surrendered a two-out 
home run in the third inning, but limited the damage to one in her ﬁ  nal full inning of work. The Peo-ria, Ariz., was relieved by freshman lefty Delanie Gourley after giving up a leadoff single to Traina in the fourth inning.
Gourley, in her ﬁ  rst appearance 
in the circle since throwing a no-hit-ter against FAMU in UF’s ﬁ  rst game of NCAA action, pitched two score-less innings to earn her 15th win of the season while Rogers earned her second save of the year by pitching the ﬁ  nal two frames.
“We don’t have a superstar on 
our team,” Walton said. “We have a bunch of players that do their job, and today was a tribute to that.  We got a Lauren quality start, Delanie gets the ‘W’ and Hannah gets the save. … For all of them to be a part of the this National Championship game was something very, very special.”
The Gators started the season 
with 22 straight wins, topping four ranked teams and shutting out sev-en teams in the process.
But after reaching the South-
eastern Conference portion of the schedule, Florida hit a slump, going just 15-9 in league play to ﬁ  nish in a three-way tie for third one year after winning the conference outright.
Florida wasn’t at its high point 
at the end of the regular season. It went one-and-out in the SEC Tour-nament, a game that became the turning point of the season

For more than 1,200 high school and 
college baseball players across the Unit-
ed States, Thursday could potentially mark one of the biggest days of their lives. The 2014 MLB First-Year Draft begins Thursday evening and will con-tinue through Saturday.
The Houston Astros have the No. 1 
overall pick for the third consecutive year. There are ﬁ  ve top-rated prospects that could hear their names called by Houston including right hander Tyler Kolek from Shepherd High in Texas, lefties Brady Aiken of Cathedral Catho-lic High in San Diego and Carlos Rodon from North Carolina State. Outﬁ  elder/catcher Alex Jackson of Rancho Ber-nardo High in San Diego and Central Florida shortstop Nick Gordon from 
Olympia H.S. are also among the potential No. 1 picks.
Kolek put together 
an impressive 2014 campaign, which in-cluded 10 games, 60.1 
innings pitched and just a 0.35 ERA. He allowed just 23 hits. Aiken had an ERA of 1.06 in 59.2 innings, but his numbers last season were slightly more impres-sive — a 0.92 ERA with nine game MLB Draft begins today,

And so they meet again, the two foes 
that could not be more different.
Besides a shared Latin American 
culture within its fanbase, the San Antonio Spurs and Miami Heat seem worlds apart. One team has the best player on the planet walking around, the ﬂ  ash and pizzazz of South Florida with all the glitz and glamour that comes with. It is a new school and new age idea of what basketball has become — an assemblage of talent by a team president that is himself a dichotomy of his basketball origins.
Pat Riley, president of the Heat, comes 
from the basketball background of Ken-tucky, the storied college basketball power-house and was coached by Adolph Rupp. You may remember Rupp as the antagonist in the Disney movie Glory Road if you don’t recognize him as one of the greatest college basketball coaches that ever lived. After Ri-ley’s playing career, he became a broadcast-er for a short period before becoming head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. He then took the NBA by storm over the next decade by implementing fast-paced brand of basketball dubbed “Showtime,” pilot-ed by Magic John-
son and anchored by Kareem Abdul-Jabar. It was a new way to play roundball, and 30 years later, again ahead of the curve, Riley’s at it again on the opposite coast.
He’s built a team around three key stars, 
with a dominant small forward in LeBron James. It’s not the old-school blueprint on how to build a champion with an increased reliance on thrift store priced role players, but it’s one that’s produced two NBA cham-pionships in a row, and the Heat look well

A line of orange-and-blue clad 
Gator fans stood outside Katie Sea-
shole Pressley Stadium and down Hull road waiting to greet the school’s newest national champi-ons.
Florida sealed the deal Tuesday 
night against No. 2-seed Alabama after the Gators won the program’s ﬁ  rst national title.
It only made sense that they 
would come home to a stadium ﬁ  lled with their biggest fans.
The event opened with senior 
Hannah Rogers leading the team into the stadium with the NCAA trophy held high and the team chanting, “It’s great to be a Florida Gator.”
The crowd clapped and chanted 
along.
UF President Bernie Machen 
greeted the squad as it placed the trophy on a blue-clothed table in the center of the ﬁ  eld and tore into packages of Twizzlers.
“We’re not just Florida’s team,” 
Machen said. “We’re America’s team.”
The crowd enthusiastically 
roared in response to Machen as he gave up the microphone to coach Tim Walton.
As Walton spoke about the 
achievements of the 2014 class and the importance of an NCAA title making its way to Gainesville, shouts of “I love you,” and “Wal-ton is the best,” echoed from the fans that had waited in line under the Florida sun at the hottest time of day, at the hottest time of the year.
Adam Schick, play-by-play 
host for Florida softball,  took over and began interviewing Stephanie Tofft, Aubree Munro and Kirsti Merritt, but it wasn’t until the ﬁ  nal name was called that the crowd went wild.
Rogers stepped next to Schick 
and as the crowd died down, strag-glers shouted their love for the four-time All-American.
“I just wanted to do it for these girls,” Rogers said to Schick as he asked her about the perfect end to a 55-12 season.
When Rogers stepped away, 
the team turned to the video board that usually displays hits, runs and errors, to watch a montage of the team’s postseason success:
Clips of home runs, Merritt’s 
“SportsCenter Top 10” catch on Tuesday night and image after image of Rogers striking out op-ponents.
The celebration ended with the 
team huddled together in a circle singing, “We Are The Champions,” and then each player parted ways to greet their friends and families.
The ﬁ  nal words of the night 
came from UF athletic director Jer-emy Foley.
“You want to know what makes 
this special,” Foley said. “This team is special. These kids are, that coach is and the way they repre-sent the University of Florida, it’s like a I said, it’s why we do what we do.”

UF athletic directorus,” Walton said before WCWS action 
began. “We actually got a couple days off and got humbled with our offense, so I think that helped us. We realized we had to make adjustments and do things different offensively and I think that was good.”
Florida finished its 11-game jour-
ney through the NCAA Tournament by outscoring opponents 82-10 with eight shutouts. 
“Most teams set goals to win ev-
ery series or win the SEC or do some things and this team actually set a goal to win a national championship,” Wal-ton said. “It’s the first one we’ve ever talked about in my coaching … but this team felt like we had the parts and the pieces to do it.”
Even with the championship in 
hand, Florida isn’t finished yet.
Kelsey Stewart — who now owns 
UF’s highest career batting average in program history with a .408 clip at the plate — will lead off the offense for two more years.
Haeger and Gourley will command 
the circle — Haeger as a senior and Gourley as a sophomore.
Florida returns its entire outfield 
— with Briana Little and Bailey Castro going for their last run as Gators and Merritt heading into her junior year — and all of its infielders except Tofft return for a third year together.
Freshmen Justine McLean and 
Chelsea Herndon, who played con-tributing roles throughout the season, will develop with a year of experience under their belts.
The pieces are there for another 
run. 
But for now, the Gators are going to 
take in the moment.
“All our hard work flashed through 
my brain — setting a goal of winning a National Championship and it actual-ly coming true,” Haeger said. “We had our lows in our season, and we lost the grip on that goal, but it all worked out.”

Miami Heat forward LeBron James participates in practice on Wednesday in 
San Antonio, Texas. The Heat face the San Antonio Spurs tonight for Game 1.
Miami chasing dynasty status
on their way to a third.
Standing in their way is their opposite. 
The homegrown squad with starters most 
fans can’t name. It is a group not spontane-ously thrown together in 2010 but grown over the course of what seems like a millen-nia. 
They are meticulous and fundamental in 
everything they do, a nod to a head coach with a military mind who played his college basketball at Air Force — Greg Popovich. Popovich has built the NBA’s version of the New England Patriots, a consistent winning machine that started success near the turn of the century and hasn’t stopped since. He even shares Patriot’s head coach Bill Belichick’s “excitement” for talking to the media.
But, unlike his counterpart, NBA architect 
Riley, Popovich did not stray from a con-servative and structured mold in his most successful coaching stop. More accurately, “Pop” built a basketball robot that consistent-ly performs at peak efficiency while fluctuat-ing from “veteran” to “old” every time they win or lose. They have the ageless wonder at power forward — Tim Duncan, and imports from France, the Virgin Islands, Argentina, Brazil, Australia, Canada and Italy. 
The teams met last year of course, and 
without some bad bounces and a dagger Ray Allen three pointer, things could be a lot dif-ferent. The Spurs would be fresh off their fifth NBA title, looking to repeat. Instead, history was written differently and James, Riley, Allen et al. got to celebrate another championship, their second in a row. 
If the Heat can win this title, Pat Riley will 
again be in the spotlight. Not necessarily for the team he’s put together, but because of what it was able to do. There’s a term for the feat, because not only did Riley just ac-complish it with the Lakers back the late-80s but he actually legally trademarked it — the three peat.
johnson’s journAl ,
 from page 17Draft continues until Saturday 
starts. Rodon, who just finished his junior sea-
son at NC State, finished 2014 with a 2.01 ERA in over 98 innings pitched. Jackson batted .400 during both his senior and sophomore seasons, and accumulated 127 RBI throughout his high school career. Gordon’s senior year featured a remarkable .497 batting average, including a .576 on base percentage.
Most mock drafts have Aiken as the top pick 
for the Astros, which would make him just the third prep lefty ever taken as the No. 1 pick in the draft.
If Aiken is taken by Houston, next on the 
board could be Rodon to the Marlins, but if Aiken doesn’t go first they could pick him up. The Marlins can benefit from a good bat though, which could cause them to pull the trigger on Gordon. There is speculation that Rodon’s fa-ther being from Miami is a factor for the Mar-lins’ pick too.
The Chicago White Sox have the third pick, 
and all signs point to Kolek. His 6-5, 230 pound frame is intimidating on the mound — not to mention he’s a prep prospect that can clock in pitches at the 100 mph mark. If Kolek is taken though, don’t expect the White Sox to reach for a bat — they would pick up Rodon if he’s still available. It would be a stretch to say he could end up in Houston, but if he did he would be the first ever prep righty to be taken at No. 1.
The Chicago Cubs will pick fourth. RHP 
Tommy Hoffmann would have likely landed here, but it was announced last month that he would need Tommy John surgery. If Rodon is available, they could snatch him as they need pitching. If not, they might pick up a bat — po-tentially Jackson from Rancho Bernardo, or Or-egon State outfielder Michael Conforto. 
The Minnesota Twins have pick No. 5, and 
Gordon seems likely to fall here. Gordon has a baseball-heavy DNA — his father Tom Gordon is a former major league pitcher, and his brother is current Dodgers second baseman Dee Gor-don. If Gordon isn’t picked here, it is because Gordon isn’t on the board by the time Minne-sota’s pick comes.

Hannah Rogers had little success in 
her first two trips to Oklahoma City.
As a freshman, she started Game 1 
against Arizona State in the Women’s 
College World Series Championship Series where she was peppered for nine hits and 10 runs in just 2.1 innings of work as UF dropped the contest 14-4.
In the second game, Rogers tossed 
four innings of relief for then-senior Stephanie Brombacher. Rogers had a better outing the second time around — giving up just three hits and two earned runs through four frames of work — but the Gators faced a 7-2 defeat as the Sun Devils claimed their second national championship in four years.
In 2013, she gave up 17 hits and 13 
runs in 15.1 innings of work as the Gators exited the tournament in three games. She left the circle after only .1 in-nings against Tennessee after giving up three runs and allowing a hit and three walks.
Fast forward to 2014 and Rogers had 
a completely different look to her.
In Florida’s third attempt to win its 
first national title, the team rode Rogers all the way.
The senior right-hander from Lake 
Wales, Fla., pitched 44 of UF’s 68 innings in NCAA play, including the final two frames in Florida’s 6-3 win against Ala-bama in Game 2 of the WCWS Cham-pionship Series to give Florida its first NCAA title.
“(It’s) very exciting, just to do it for 
Coach and all the hard work he’s put in all of the four years I’ve been here,” Rog-ers said.
The final game against the Crimson Tide was the first that Rogers did not start in the Women’s College World Se-ries.
She didn’t need to. Junior Lauren 
Haeger and freshman Delanie Gourley combined for five innings of work, giv-ing up just two runs and five hits while striking out three batters.
“I’ve always trusted Coach, and I 
knew he was making the right deci-sion,” Rogers said. “I knew that Lauren was going to shut ‘em down, and Dela-nie was going to come in and shut ‘em down, and I was excited to see everyone play well today.”
Rogers was named the 2014 Women’s 
College World Series Most Outstand-ing Player after giving up just 17 hits in 28 innings and allowing only four runs while in Oklahoma City.
“It was very exciting to hear my name 
and how excited my teammates were for me,” she said, “and I couldn’t have done it without the defense behind me, and the offense they did this week, and all the hard work we put in throughout this season.”
Rogers finished her career as Florida’s 
most prolific pitcher since Stacey Nel-son. She became Florida’s first four-time All-American and is the first UF pitcher to throw three no-hitters in her career.
Rogers finished second all-time in 
program history to Nelson in wins (127), saves (14), starts (141), complete games (108), shutouts (41), innings pitched (988) and strikeouts (833).
Despite all of the accolades, all the 
success and all the triumphs, Rogers knows that Florida could not have won it all by her work alone.
Kelsey Stewart, Kirsti Merritt, Aubree 
Munro and Bailey Castro — who com-bined for a .436 batting average, four of UF’s six home runs and 13 of Florida’s 31 RBIs in the five games — joined Rog-ers on the 2014 All-Tournament Team, a testament that her team truly did have her back the whole way through.
“We just stayed together,” Rogers said 
in a postgame interview with ESPN. “We played together this whole way through the season and NCAA Tourna-ment and I’m just so proud of them.”
